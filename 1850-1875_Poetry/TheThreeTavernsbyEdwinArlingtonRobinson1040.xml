     <p>The Valley of the Shadow</p>
     <lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">There were faces to remember in the Valley of the Shadow ,</l>
       <l n="2">There were faces unregarded , there were faces to forget ;</l>
       <l n="3">There were fires of grief and fear that are a few forgotten ashes ,</l>
       <l n="4">There were sparks of recognition that are not forgotten yet .</l>
       <l n="5">For at first , with an amazed and overwhelming indignation</l>
       <l n="6">At a measureless malfeasance that obscurely willed it thus ,</l>
       <l n="7">They were lost and unacquainted — till they found themselves in others ,</l>
       <l n="8">Who had groped as they were groping where dim ways were perilous .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="9">There were lives that were as dark as are the fears and intuitions</l>
       <l n="10">Of a child who knows himself and is alone with what he knows ;</l>
       <l n="11">There were pensioners of dreams and there were debtors of illusions ,</l>
       <l n="12">All to fail before the triumph of a weed that only grows .</l>
       <l n="13">There were thirsting heirs of golden sieves that held not wine or water ,</l>
       <l n="14">And had no names in traffic or more value there than toys :</l>
       <l n="15">There were blighted sons of wonder in the Valley of the Shadow ,</l>
       <l n="16">Where they suffered and still wondered why their wonder made no noise .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="17">There were slaves who dragged the shackles of a precedent unbroken ,</l>
       <l n="18">Demonstrating the fulfilment of unalterable schemes ,</l>
       <l n="19">Which had been , before the cradle , Time 's inexorable tenants</l>
       <l n="20">Of what were now the dusty ruins of their father 's dreams .</l>
       <l n="21">There were these , and there were many who had stumbled up to manhood ,</l>
       <l n="22">Where they saw too late the road they should have taken long ago :</l>
       <l n="23">There were thwarted clerks and fiddlers in the Valley of the Shadow ,</l>
       <l n="24">The commemorative wreckage of what others did not know .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="25">And there were daughters older than the mothers who had borne them ,</l>
       <l n="26">Being older in their wisdom , which is older than the earth ;</l>
       <l n="27">And they were going forward only farther into darkness ,</l>
       <l n="28">Unrelieved as were the blasting obligations of their birth ;</l>
       <l n="29">And among them , giving always what was not for their possession ,</l>
       <l n="30">There were maidens , very quiet , with no quiet in their eyes :</l>
       <l n="31">There were daughters of the silence in the Valley of the Shadow ,</l>
       <l n="32">Each an isolated item in the family sacrifice .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="33">There were creepers among catacombs where dull regrets were torches ,</l>
       <l n="34">Giving light enough to show them what was there upon the shelves —</l>
       <l n="35">Where there was more for them to see than pleasure would remember</l>
       <l n="36">Of something that had been alive and once had been themselves .</l>
       <l n="37">There were some who stirred the ruins with a solid imprecation ,</l>
       <l n="38">While as many fled repentance for the promise of despair :</l>
       <l n="39">There were drinkers of wrong waters in the Valley of the Shadow ,</l>
       <l n="40">And all the sparkling ways were dust that once had led them there .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="41">There were some who knew the steps of Age incredibly beside them ,</l>
       <l n="42">And his fingers upon shoulders that had never felt the wheel ;</l>
       <l n="43">And their last of empty trophies was a gilded cup of nothing ,</l>
       <l n="44">Which a contemplating vagabond would not have come to steal .</l>
       <l n="45">Long and often had they figured for a larger valuation ,</l>
       <l n="46">But the size of their addition was the balance of a doubt :</l>
       <l n="47">There were gentlemen of leisure in the Valley of the Shadow ,</l>
       <l n="48">Not allured by retrospection , disenchanted , and played out .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="49">And among the dark endurances of unavowed reprisals</l>
       <l n="50">There were silent eyes of envy that saw little but saw well ;</l>
       <l n="51">And over beauty 's aftermath of hazardous ambitions</l>
       <l n="52">There were tears for what had vanished as they vanished where they fell .</l>
       <l n="53">Not assured of what was theirs , and always hungry for the nameless ,</l>
       <l n="54">There were some whose only passion was for Time who made them cold :</l>
       <l n="55">There were numerous fair women in the Valley of the Shadow ,</l>
       <l n="56">Dreaming rather less of heaven than of hell when they were old .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="57">Now and then , as if to scorn the common touch of common sorrow ,</l>
       <l n="58">There were some who gave a few the distant pity of a smile ;</l>
       <l n="59">And another cloaked a soul as with an ash of human embers ,</l>
       <l n="60">Having covered thus a treasure that would last him for a while .</l>
       <l n="61">There were many by the presence of the many disaffected ,</l>
       <l n="62">Whose exemption was included in the weight that others bore :</l>
       <l n="63">There were seekers after darkness in the Valley of the Shadow ,</l>
       <l n="64">And they alone were there to find what they were looking for .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="9">
       <l n="65">So they were , and so they are ; and as they came are coming others ,</l>
       <l n="66">And among them are the fearless and the meek and the unborn ;</l>
       <l n="67">And a question that has held us heretofore without an answer</l>
       <l n="68">May abide without an answer until all have ceased to mourn .</l>
       <l n="69">For the children of the dark are more to name than are the wretched ,</l>
       <l n="70">Or the broken , or the weary , or the baffled , or the shamed :</l>
       <l n="71">There are builders of new mansions in the Valley of the Shadow ,</l>
       <l n="72">And among them are the dying and the blinded and the maimed .</l>

       <l n="1">The Wandering Jew</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="2">I saw by looking in his eyes</l>
       <l n="3">That they remembered everything ;</l>
       <l n="4">And this was how I came to know</l>
       <l n="5">That he was here , still wandering .</l>
       <l n="6">For though the figure and the scene</l>
       <l n="7">Were never to be reconciled ,</l>
       <l n="8">I knew the man as I had known</l>
       <l n="9">His image when I was a child .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="10">With evidence at every turn ,</l>
       <l n="11">I should have held it safe to guess</l>
       <l n="12">That all the newness of New York</l>
       <l n="13">Had nothing new in loneliness ;</l>
       <l n="14">Yet here was one who might be Noah ,</l>
       <l n="15">Or Nathan , or Abimelech ,</l>
       <l n="16">Or Lamech , out of ages lost , —</l>
       <l n="17">Or , more than all , Melchizedek .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="18">Assured that he was none of these ,</l>
       <l n="19">I gave them back their names again ,</l>
       <l n="20">To scan once more those endless eyes</l>
       <l n="21">Where all my questions ended then .</l>
       <l n="22">I found in them what they revealed</l>
       <l n="23">That I shall not live to forget ,</l>
       <l n="24">And wondered if they found in mine</l>
       <l n="25">Compassion that I might regret .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="26">Pity , I learned , was not the least</l>
       <l n="27">Of time 's offending benefits</l>
       <l n="28">That had now for so long impugned</l>
       <l n="29">The conservation of his wits :</l>
       <l n="30">Rather it was that I should yield ,</l>
       <l n="31">Alone , the fealty that presents</l>
       <l n="32">The tribute of a tempered ear</l>
       <l n="33">To an untempered eloquence .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="34">Before I pondered long enough</l>
       <l n="35">On whence he came and who he was ,</l>
       <l n="36">I trembled at his ringing wealth</l>
       <l n="37">Of manifold anathemas ;</l>
       <l n="38">I wondered , while he seared the world ,</l>
       <l n="39">What new defection ailed the race ,</l>
       <l n="40">And if it mattered how remote</l>
       <l n="41">Our fathers were from such a place .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="42">Before there was an hour for me</l>
       <l n="43">To contemplate with less concern</l>
       <l n="44">The crumbling realm awaiting us</l>
       <l n="45">Than his that was beyond return ,</l>
       <l n="46">A dawning on the dust of years</l>
       <l n="47">Had shaped with an elusive light</l>
       <l n="48">Mirages of remembered scenes</l>
       <l n="49">That were no longer for the sight .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="50">For now the gloom that hid the man</l>
       <l n="51">Became a daylight on his wrath ,</l>
       <l n="52">And one wherein my fancy viewed</l>
       <l n="53">New lions ramping in his path .</l>
       <l n="54">The old were dead and had no fangs ,</l>
       <l n="55">Wherefore he loved them — seeing not</l>
       <l n="56">They were the same that in their time</l>
       <l n="57">Had eaten everything they caught .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="9">
       <l n="58">The world around him was a gift</l>
       <l n="59">Of anguish to his eyes and ears ,</l>
       <l n="60">And one that he had long reviled</l>
       <l n="61">As fit for devils , not for seers .</l>
       <l n="62">Where , then , was there a place for him</l>
       <l n="63">That on this other side of death</l>
       <l n="64">Saw nothing good , as he had seen</l>
       <l n="65">No good come out of Nazareth ?</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="10">
       <l n="66">Yet here there was a reticence ,</l>
       <l n="67">And I believe his only one ,</l>
       <l n="68">That hushed him as if he beheld</l>
       <l n="69">A Presence that would not be gone .</l>
       <l n="70">In such a silence he confessed</l>
       <l n="71">How much there was to be denied ;</l>
       <l n="72">And he would look at me and live ,</l>
       <l n="73">As others might have looked and died .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="11">
       <l n="74">As if at last he knew again</l>
       <l n="75">That he had always known , his eyes</l>
       <l n="76">Were like to those of one who gazed</l>
       <l n="77">On those of One who never dies .</l>
       <l n="78">For such a moment he revealed</l>
       <l n="79">What life has in it to be lost ;</l>
       <l n="80">And I could ask if what I saw ,</l>
       <l n="81">Before me there , was man or ghost .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="12">
       <l n="82">He may have died so many times</l>
       <l n="83">That all there was of him to see</l>
       <l n="84">Was pride , that kept itself alive</l>
       <l n="85">As too rebellious to be free ;</l>
       <l n="86">He may have told , when more than once</l>
       <l n="87">Humility seemed imminent ,</l>
       <l n="88">How many a lonely time in vain</l>
       <l n="89">The Second Coming came and went .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="13">
       <l n="90">Whether he still defies or not</l>
       <l n="91">The failure of an angry task</l>
       <l n="92">That relegates him out of time</l>
       <l n="93">To chaos , I can only ask .</l>
       <l n="94">But as I knew him , so he was ;</l>
       <l n="95">And somewhere among men to-day</l>
       <l n="96">Those old , unyielding eyes may flash ,</l>
       <l n="97">And flinch — and look the other way .</l>

       <l n="5">In how he went and what he said :</l>

     </lg>
     <p>When the brethren heard of us , they came to meet us as far as Appii Forum , and The Three Taverns . ( Acts 28 : 15 )</p>
     <lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">Herodion , Apelles , Amplias ,</l>
       <l n="2">And Andronicus ? Is it you I see —</l>
       <l n="3">At last ? And is it you now that are gazing</l>
       <l n="4">As if in doubt of me ? Was I not saying</l>
       <l n="5">That I should come to Rome ? I did say that ;</l>
       <l n="6">And I said furthermore that I should go</l>
       <l n="7">On westward , where the gateway of the world</l>
       <l n="8">Lets in the central sea . I did say that ,</l>
       <l n="9">But I say only , now , that I am Paul —</l>
       <l n="10">A prisoner of the Law , and of the Lord</l>
       <l n="11">A voice made free . If there be time enough</l>
       <l n="12">To live , I may have more to tell you then</l>
       <l n="13">Of western matters . I go now to Rome ,</l>
       <l n="14">Where Caesar waits for me , and I shall wait ,</l>
       <l n="15">And Caesar knows how long . In Caesarea</l>
       <l n="16">There was a legend of Agrippa saying</l>
       <l n="17">In a light way to Festus , having heard</l>
       <l n="18">My deposition , that I might be free ,</l>
       <l n="19">Had I stayed free of Caesar ; but the word</l>
       <l n="20">Of God would have it as you see it is —</l>
       <l n="21">And here I am . The cup that I shall drink</l>
       <l n="22">Is mine to drink — the moment or the place</l>
       <l n="23">Not mine to say . If it be now in Rome ,</l>
       <l n="24">Be it now in Rome ; and if your faith exceed</l>
       <l n="25">The shadow cast of hope , say not of me</l>
       <l n="26">Too surely or too soon that years and shipwreck ,</l>
       <l n="27">And all the many deserts I have crossed</l>
       <l n="28">That are not named or regioned , have undone</l>
       <l n="29">Beyond the brevities of our mortal healing</l>
       <l n="30">The part of me that is the least of me .</l>
       <l n="31">You see an older man than he who fell</l>
       <l n="32">Prone to the earth when he was nigh Damascus ,</l>
       <l n="33">Where the great light came down ; yet I am he</l>
       <l n="34">That fell , and he that saw , and he that heard .</l>
       <l n="35">And I am here , at last ; and if at last</l>
       <l n="36">I give myself to make another crumb</l>
       <l n="37">For this pernicious feast of time and men —</l>
       <l n="38">Well , I have seen too much of time and men</l>
       <l n="39">To fear the ravening or the wrath of either .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="40">Yes , it is Paul you see — the Saul of Tarsus</l>
       <l n="41">That was a fiery Jew , and had men slain</l>
       <l n="42">For saying Something was beyond the Law ,</l>
       <l n="43">And in ourselves . I fed my suffering soul</l>
       <l n="44">Upon the Law till I went famishing ,</l>
       <l n="45">Not knowing that I starved . How should I know ,</l>
       <l n="46">More then than any , that the food I had —</l>
       <l n="47">What else it may have been — was not for me ?</l>
       <l n="48">My fathers and their fathers and their fathers</l>
       <l n="49">Had found it good , and said there was no other ,</l>
       <l n="50">And I was of the line . When Stephen fell ,</l>
       <l n="51">Among the stones that crushed his life away ,</l>
       <l n="52">There was no place alive that I could see</l>
       <l n="53">For such a man . Why should a man be given</l>
       <l n="54">To live beyond the Law ? So I said then ,</l>
       <l n="55">As men say now to me . How then do I</l>
       <l n="56">Persist in living ? Is that what you ask ?</l>
       <l n="57">If so , let my appearance be for you</l>
       <l n="58">No living answer ; for Time writes of death</l>
       <l n="59">On men before they die , and what you see</l>
       <l n="60">Is not the man . The man that you see not —</l>
       <l n="61">The man within the man — is most alive ;</l>
       <l n="62">Though hatred would have ended , long ago ,</l>
       <l n="63">The bane of his activities . I have lived ,</l>
       <l n="64">Because the faith within me that is life</l>
       <l n="65">Endures to live , and shall , till soon or late ,</l>
       <l n="66">Death , like a friend unseen , shall say to me</l>
       <l n="67">My toil is over and my work begun .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="68">How often , and how many a time again ,</l>
       <l n="69">Have I said I should be with you in Rome !</l>
       <l n="70">He who is always coming never comes ,</l>
       <l n="71">Or comes too late , you may have told yourselves ;</l>
       <l n="72">And I may tell you now that after me ,</l>
       <l n="73">Whether I stay for little or for long ,</l>
       <l n="74">The wolves are coming . Have an eye for them ,</l>
       <l n="75">And a more careful ear for their confusion</l>
       <l n="76">Than you need have much longer for the sound</l>
       <l n="77">Of what I tell you — should I live to say</l>
       <l n="78">More than I say to Caesar . What I know</l>
       <l n="79">Is down for you to read in what is written ;</l>
       <l n="80">And if I cloud a little with my own</l>
       <l n="81">Mortality the gleam that is immortal ,</l>
       <l n="82">I do it only because I am I —</l>
       <l n="83">Being on earth and of it , in so far</l>
       <l n="84">As time flays yet the remnant . This you know ;</l>
       <l n="85">And if I sting men , as I do sometimes ,</l>
       <l n="86">With a sharp word that hurts , it is because</l>
       <l n="87">Man 's habit is to feel before he sees ;</l>
       <l n="88">And I am of a race that feels . Moreover ,</l>
       <l n="89">The world is here for what is not yet here</l>
       <l n="90">For more than are a few ; and even in Rome ,</l>
       <l n="91">Where men are so enamored of the Cross</l>
       <l n="92">That fame has echoed , and increasingly ,</l>
       <l n="93">The music of your love and of your faith</l>
       <l n="94">To foreign ears that are as far away</l>
       <l n="95">As Antioch and Haran , yet I wonder</l>
       <l n="96">How much of love you know , and if your faith</l>
       <l n="97">Be the shut fruit of words . If so , remember</l>
       <l n="98">Words are but shells unfilled . Jews have at least</l>
       <l n="99">A Law to make them sorry they were born</l>
       <l n="100">If they go long without it ; and these Gentiles ,</l>
       <l n="101">For the first time in shrieking history ,</l>
       <l n="102">Have love and law together , if so they will ,</l>
       <l n="103">For their defense and their immunity</l>
       <l n="104">In these last days . Rome , if I know the name ,</l>
       <l n="105">Will have anon a crown of thorns and fire</l>
       <l n="106">Made ready for the wreathing of new masters ,</l>
       <l n="107">Of whom we are appointed , you and I , —</l>
       <l n="108">And you are still to be when I am gone ,</l>
       <l n="109">Should I go presently . Let the word fall ,</l>
       <l n="110">Meanwhile , upon the dragon-ridden field</l>
       <l n="111">Of circumstance , either to live or die ;</l>
       <l n="112">Concerning which there is a parable ,</l>
       <l n="113">Made easy for the comfort and attention</l>
       <l n="114">Of those who preach , fearing they preach in vain .</l>
       <l n="115">You are to plant , and then to plant again</l>
       <l n="116">Where you have gathered , gathering as you go ;</l>
       <l n="117">For you are in the fields that are eternal ,</l>
       <l n="118">And you have not the burden of the Lord</l>
       <l n="119">Upon your mortal shoulders . What you have</l>
       <l n="120">Is a light yoke , made lighter by the wearing ,</l>
       <l n="121">Till it shall have the wonder and the weight</l>
       <l n="122">Of a clear jewel , shining with a light</l>
       <l n="123">Wherein the sun and all the fiery stars</l>
       <l n="124">May soon be fading . When Gamaliel said</l>
       <l n="125">That if they be of men these things are nothing ,</l>
       <l n="126">But if they be of God they are for none</l>
       <l n="127">To overthrow , he spoke as a good Jew ,</l>
       <l n="128">And one who stayed a Jew ; and he said all .</l>
       <l n="129">And you know , by the temper of your faith ,</l>
       <l n="130">How far the fire is in you that I felt</l>
       <l n="131">Before I knew Damascus . A word here ,</l>
       <l n="132">Or there , or not there , or not anywhere ,</l>
       <l n="133">Is not the Word that lives and is the life ;</l>
       <l n="134">And you , therefore , need weary not yourselves</l>
       <l n="135">With jealous aches of others . If the world</l>
       <l n="136">Were not a world of aches and innovations ,</l>
       <l n="137">Attainment would have no more joy of it .</l>
       <l n="138">There will be creeds and schisms , creeds in creeds ,</l>
       <l n="139">And schisms in schisms ; myriads will be done</l>
       <l n="140">To death because a farthing has two sides ,</l>
       <l n="141">And is at last a farthing . Telling you this ,</l>
       <l n="142">I , who bid men to live , appeal to Caesar .</l>
       <l n="143">Once I had said the ways of God were dark ,</l>
       <l n="144">Meaning by that the dark ways of the Law .</l>
       <l n="145">Such is the glory of our tribulations ;</l>
       <l n="146">For the Law kills the flesh that kills the Law ,</l>
       <l n="147">And we are then alive . We have eyes then ;</l>
       <l n="148">And we have then the Cross between two worlds —</l>
       <l n="149">To guide us , or to blind us for a time ,</l>
       <l n="150">Till we have eyes indeed . The fire that smites</l>
       <l n="151">A few on highways , changing all at once ,</l>
       <l n="152">Is not for all . The power that holds the world</l>
       <l n="153">Away from God that holds himself away —</l>
       <l n="154">Farther away than all your works and words</l>
       <l n="155">Are like to fly without the wings of faith —</l>
       <l n="156">Was not , nor ever shall be , a small hazard</l>
       <l n="157">Enlivening the ways of easy leisure</l>
       <l n="158">Or the cold road of knowledge . When our eyes</l>
       <l n="159">Have wisdom , we see more than we remember ;</l>
       <l n="160">And the old world of our captivities</l>
       <l n="161">May then become a smitten glimpse of ruin ,</l>
       <l n="162">Like one where vanished hewers have had their day</l>
       <l n="163">Of wrath on Lebanon . Before we see ,</l>
       <l n="164">Meanwhile , we suffer ; and I come to you ,</l>
       <l n="165">At last , through many storms and through much night .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="166">Yet whatsoever I have undergone ,</l>
       <l n="167">My keepers in this instance are not hard .</l>
       <l n="168">But for the chance of an ingratitude ,</l>
       <l n="169">I might indeed be curious of their mercy ,</l>
       <l n="170">And fearful of their leisure while I wait ,</l>
       <l n="171">A few leagues out of Rome . Men go to Rome ,</l>
       <l n="172">Not always to return — but not that now .</l>
       <l n="173">Meanwhile , I seem to think you look at me</l>
       <l n="174">With eyes that are at last more credulous</l>
       <l n="175">Of my identity . You remark in me</l>
       <l n="176">No sort of leaping giant , though some words</l>
       <l n="177">Of mine to you from Corinth may have leapt</l>
       <l n="178">A little through your eyes into your soul .</l>
       <l n="179">I trust they were alive , and are alive</l>
       <l n="180">Today ; for there be none that shall indite</l>
       <l n="181">So much of nothing as the man of words</l>
       <l n="182">Who writes in the Lord 's name for his name 's sake</l>
       <l n="183">And has not in his blood the fire of time</l>
       <l n="184">To warm eternity . Let such a man —</l>
       <l n="185">If once the light is in him and endures —</l>
       <l n="186">Content himself to be the general man ,</l>
       <l n="187">Set free to sift the decencies and thereby</l>
       <l n="188">To learn , except he be one set aside</l>
       <l n="189">For sorrow , more of pleasure than of pain ;</l>
       <l n="190">Though if his light be not the light indeed ,</l>
       <l n="191">But a brief shine that never really was ,</l>
       <l n="192">And fails , leaving him worse than where he was ,</l>
       <l n="193">Then shall he be of all men destitute .</l>
       <l n="194">And here were not an issue for much ink ,</l>

       <l n="244">All which have I conceded and set down</l>
       <l n="245">In words that have no shadow . What is dark</l>
       <l n="246">Is dark , and we may not say otherwise ;</l>

       <l n="249">A coming gleam across the gulf of ages ,</l>
       <l n="250">And a way home from shipwreck to the shore ;</l>
       <l n="251">And so , through pangs and ills and desperations ,</l>
       <l n="252">There may be light for all . There shall be light .</l>
       <l n="253">As much as that , you know . You cannot say</l>
       <l n="254">This woman or that man will be the next</l>
       <l n="255">On whom it falls ; you are not here for that .</l>
       <l n="256">Your ministration is to be for others</l>
       <l n="257">The firing of a rush that may for them</l>
       <l n="258">Be soon the fire itself . The few at first</l>
       <l n="259">Are fighting for the multitude at last ;</l>
       <l n="260">Therefore remember what Gamaliel said</l>
       <l n="261">Before you , when the sick were lying down</l>
       <l n="262">In streets all night for Peter 's passing shadow .</l>
       <l n="263">Fight , and say what you feel ; say more than words .</l>

       <l n="266">Say what you feel , while you have time to say it .</l>
       <l n="267">Eternity will answer for itself ,</l>
       <l n="268">Without your intercession ; yet the way</l>
       <l n="269">For many is a long one , and as dark ,</l>
       <l n="270">Meanwhile , as dreams of hell . See not your toil</l>
       <l n="271">Too much , and if I be away from you ,</l>
       <l n="272">Think of me as a brother to yourselves ,</l>
       <l n="273">Of many blemishes . Beware of stoics ,</l>
       <l n="274">And give your left hand to grammarians ;</l>
       <l n="275">And when you seem , as many a time you may ,</l>
       <l n="276">To have no other friend than hope , remember</l>
       <l n="277">That you are not the first , or yet the last .</l>

       <l n="281">Would have them ) is in what we do not know .</l>
       <l n="282">Make , then , for all your fears a place to sleep</l>
       <l n="283">With all your faded sins ; nor think yourselves</l>
       <l n="284">Egregious and alone for your defects</l>
       <l n="285">Of youth and yesterday . I was young once ;</l>
       <l n="286">And there 's a question if you played the fool</l>

       <l n="288">Than I have in my story to remember ,</l>

       <l n="302">Of its old ills and ashes , and the traps</l>
       <l n="303">Of its apparent wrath . Many with ears</l>
       <l n="304">That hear not yet , shall have ears given to them ,</l>
       <l n="305">And then they shall hear strangely . Many with eyes</l>
       <l n="306">That are incredulous of the Mystery</l>
       <l n="307">Shall yet be driven to feel , and then to read</l>
       <l n="308">Where language has an end and is a veil ,</l>
       <l n="309">Not woven of our words . Many that hate</l>
       <l n="310">Their kind are soon to know that without love</l>
       <l n="311">Their faith is but the perjured name of nothing .</l>

       <l n="318">To you that out of wisdom has come love ,</l>
       <l n="319">That measures and is of itself the measure</l>
       <l n="320">Of works and hope and faith . Your longest hours</l>
       <l n="321">Are not so long that you may torture them</l>
       <l n="322">And harass not yourselves ; and the last days</l>
       <l n="323">Are on the way that you prepare for them ,</l>
       <l n="324">And was prepared for you , here in a world</l>
       <l n="325">Where you have sinned and suffered , striven and seen .</l>

       <l n="330">Well , I have talked and rested , though I fear</l>
       <l n="331">My rest has not been yours ; in which event ,</l>

       <l n="333">From Caesar . When I told you I should come ,</l>

       <l n="336">That which the Law saw not . But this , indeed ,</l>
       <l n="337">Was good of you , and I shall not forget ;</l>

     <p>Note . — The following imaginary dialogue between Alexander Hamilton and Aaron Burr , which is not based upon any specific incident in American history , may be supposed to have occurred a few months previous to Hamilton 's retirement from Washington 's Cabinet in 1795 and a few years before the political ingenuities of Burr — who has been characterized , without much exaggeration , as the inventor of American politics — began to be conspicuously formidable to the Federalists . These activities on the part of Burr resulted , as the reader will remember , in the Burr-Jefferson tie for the Presidency in 1800 , and finally in the Burr-Hamilton duel at Weehawken in 1804 .</p>
     <lg type="poem">

       <l n="1">Hamilton , if he rides you down , remember</l>

       <l n="3">Your fabric from catastrophe . That 's good ;</l>
       <l n="4">For I perceive that you observe him also .</l>
       <l n="5">A President , a-riding of his horse ,</l>
       <l n="6">May dust a General and be forgiven ;</l>
       <l n="7">But why be dusted — when we 're all alike ,</l>
       <l n="8">All equal , and all happy . Here he comes —</l>
       <l n="9">And there he goes . And we , by your new patent ,</l>
       <l n="10">Would seem to be two kings here by the wayside ,</l>
       <l n="11">With our two hats off to his Excellency .</l>
       <l n="12">Why not his Majesty , and done with it ?</l>
       <l n="13">Forgive me if I shook your meditation ,</l>
       <l n="14">But you that weld our credit should have eyes</l>

       <l n="6">But owe me not your sceptre . These are the days</l>

       <l n="1">Never a doubt . But what you hear the most</l>

       <l n="8">Before the coffin comes ? For all you know ,</l>
       <l n="9">The tree that is to fall for your last house</l>
       <l n="10">Is now a sapling . You may have to wait</l>

       <l n="13">Where chilly whispers of a likely frost</l>

       <l n="15">I think a touch of ermine , Hamilton ,</l>

       <l n="1">Here 's a new tune</l>
       <l n="2">From Hamilton . Has your caution all at once ,</l>
       <l n="3">And over night , grown till it wrecks the cradle ?</l>
       <l n="4">I have forgotten what my father said</l>
       <l n="5">When I was born , but there 's a rustling of it</l>
       <l n="6">Among my memories , and it makes a noise</l>
       <l n="7">About as loud as all that I have held</l>
       <l n="8">And fondled heretofore of your same caution .</l>
       <l n="9">But that 's affairs , not feelings . If our friends</l>
       <l n="10">Guessed half we say of them , our enemies</l>
       <l n="11">Would itch in our friends ’ jackets . Howsoever ,</l>
       <l n="12">The world is of a sudden on its head ,</l>
       <l n="13">And all are spilled — unless you cling alone</l>
       <l n="14">With Washington . Ask Adams about that .</l>

       <l n="1">It was a man , Burr , that was in my mind ;</l>

       <l n="3">A man whose occupation is the need</l>

       <l n="5">And one who shapes an age while he endures</l>
       <l n="6">The pin pricks of inferiorities ;</l>
       <l n="7">A cautious man , because he is but one ;</l>
       <l n="8">A lonely man , because he is a thousand .</l>
       <l n="9">No marvel you are slow to find in him</l>
       <l n="10">The genius that is one spark or is nothing :</l>
       <l n="11">His genius is a flame that he must hold</l>
       <l n="12">So far above the common heads of men</l>
       <l n="13">That they may view him only through the mist</l>
       <l n="14">Of their defect , and wonder what he is .</l>
       <l n="15">It seems to me the mystery that is in him</l>

       <l n="8">Parts make a whole , if we 've enough of them ;</l>

       <l n="2">Though for your sake I would not have you now</l>
       <l n="3">So near to me tonight as now you are ,</l>
       <l n="4">God knows how much a stranger to my heart</l>
       <l n="5">Was any cold word that I may have written ;</l>
       <l n="6">And you , poor woman that I made my wife ,</l>
       <l n="7">You have had more of loneliness , I fear ,</l>
       <l n="8">Than I — though I have been the most alone ,</l>
       <l n="9">Even when the most attended . So it was</l>
       <l n="10">God set the mark of his inscrutable</l>
       <l n="11">Necessity on one that was to grope ,</l>
       <l n="12">And serve , and suffer , and withal be glad</l>
       <l n="13">For what was his , and is , and is to be ,</l>
       <l n="14">When his old bones , that are a burden now ,</l>
       <l n="15">Are saying what the man who carried them</l>
       <l n="16">Had not the power to say . Bones in a grave ,</l>
       <l n="17">Cover them as they will with choking earth ,</l>
       <l n="18">May shout the truth to men who put them there ,</l>
       <l n="19">More than all orators . And so , my dear ,</l>
       <l n="20">Since you have cheated wisdom for the sake</l>
       <l n="21">Of sorrow , let your sorrow be for you ,</l>
       <l n="22">This last of nights before the last of days ,</l>
       <l n="23">The lying ghost of what there is of me</l>
       <l n="24">That is the most alive . There is no death</l>
       <l n="25">For me in what they do . Their death it is</l>
       <l n="26">They should heed most when the sun comes again</l>
       <l n="27">To make them solemn . There are some I know</l>
       <l n="28">Whose eyes will hardly see their occupation ,</l>
       <l n="29">For tears in them — and all for one old man ;</l>
       <l n="30">For some of them will pity this old man ,</l>
       <l n="31">Who took upon himself the work of God</l>
       <l n="32">Because he pitied millions . That will be</l>
       <l n="33">For them , I fancy , their compassionate</l>
       <l n="34">Best way of saying what is best in them</l>
       <l n="35">To say ; for they can say no more than that ,</l>
       <l n="36">And they can do no more than what the dawn</l>
       <l n="37">Of one more day shall give them light enough</l>

       <l n="57">A stranger to itself , and to the world</l>
       <l n="58">A more prodigious upstart among states</l>

       <l n="60">Till they are told and told , and told again ;</l>

       <l n="62">And most of them are children all their lives .</l>

       <l n="194">Now come into his house , along with me :</l>
       <l n="195">The four square sombre things that you see first</l>
       <l n="196">Around you are four walls that go as high</l>
       <l n="197">As to the ceiling . Norcross knew them well ,</l>
       <l n="198">And he knew others like them . Fasten to that</l>
       <l n="199">With all the claws of your intelligence ;</l>
       <l n="200">And hold the man before you in his house</l>
       <l n="201">As if he were a white rat in a box ,</l>
       <l n="202">And one that knew himself to be no other .</l>
       <l n="203">I tell you twice that he knew all about it ,</l>
       <l n="204">That you may not forget the worst of all</l>
       <l n="205">Our tragedies begin with what we know .</l>
       <l n="206">Could Norcross only not have known , I wonder</l>
       <l n="207">How many would have blessed and envied him !</l>
       <l n="208">Could he have had the usual eye for spots</l>
       <l n="209">On others , and for none upon himself ,</l>
       <l n="210">I smile to ponder on the carriages</l>
       <l n="211">That might as well as not have clogged the town</l>
       <l n="212">In honor of his end . For there was gold ,</l>
       <l n="213">You see , though all he needed was a little ,</l>
       <l n="214">And what he gave said nothing of who gave it .</l>
       <l n="215">He would have given it all if in return</l>
       <l n="216">There might have been a more sufficient face</l>
       <l n="217">To greet him when he shaved . Though you insist</l>
       <l n="218">It is the dower , and always , of our degree</l>
       <l n="219">Not to be cursed with such invidious insight ,</l>
       <l n="220">Remember that you stand , you and your fancy ,</l>
       <l n="221">Now in his house ; and since we are together ,</l>
       <l n="222">See for yourself and tell me what you see .</l>
       <l n="223">Tell me the best you see . Make a slight noise</l>
       <l n="224">Of recognition when you find a book</l>
       <l n="225">That you would not as lief read upside down</l>
       <l n="226">As otherwise , for example . If there you fail ,</l>
       <l n="227">Observe the walls and lead me to the place ,</l>
       <l n="228">Where you are led . If there you meet a picture</l>
       <l n="229">That holds you near it for a longer time</l>
       <l n="230">Than you are sorry , you may call it yours ,</l>
       <l n="231">And hang it in the dark of your remembrance ,</l>
       <l n="232">Where Norcross never sees . How can he see</l>
       <l n="233">That has no eyes to see ? And as for music ,</l>
       <l n="234">He paid with empty wonder for the pangs</l>
       <l n="235">Of his infrequent forced endurance of it ;</l>
       <l n="236">And having had no pleasure , paid no more</l>
       <l n="237">For needless immolation , or for the sight</l>
       <l n="238">Of those who heard what he was never to hear .</l>
       <l n="239">To see them listening was itself enough</l>
       <l n="240">To make him suffer ; and to watch worn eyes ,</l>
       <l n="241">On other days , of strangers who forgot</l>
       <l n="242">Their sorrows and their failures and themselves</l>
       <l n="243">Before a few mysterious odds and ends</l>
       <l n="244">Of marble carted from the Parthenon —</l>
       <l n="245">And all for seeing what he was never to see ,</l>
       <l n="246">Because it was alive and he was dead —</l>
       <l n="247">Here was a wonder that was more profound</l>

       <l n="12">That is the common genius of the dead .</l>
       <l n="13">I might as well have heard him : “ Never mind ;</l>

       <l n="15">The rest of us were not so far ahead . ”</l>

     </lg>
     <p>Note . — Rahel Robert and Varnhagen von Ense were married , after many protestations on her part , in 1814 . The marriage — so far as he was concerned , at any rate — appears to have been satisfactory .</p>

       <l n="1">Now you have read them all ; or if not all ,</l>
       <l n="2">As many as in all conscience I should fancy</l>
       <l n="3">To be enough . There are no more of them —</l>
       <l n="4">Or none to burn your sleep , or to bring dreams</l>
       <l n="5">Of devils . If these are not sufficient , surely</l>
       <l n="6">You are a strange young man . I might live on</l>
       <l n="7">Alone , and for another forty years ,</l>
       <l n="8">Or not quite forty , — are you happier now ? —</l>
       <l n="9">Always to ask if there prevailed elsewhere</l>
       <l n="10">Another like yourself that would have held</l>
       <l n="11">These aged hands as long as you have held them ,</l>
       <l n="12">Not once observing , for all I can see ,</l>
       <l n="13">How they are like your mother 's . Well , you have read</l>
       <l n="14">His letters now , and you have heard me say</l>
       <l n="15">That in them are the cinders of a passion</l>
       <l n="16">That was my life ; and you have not yet broken</l>
       <l n="17">Your way out of my house , out of my sight , —</l>
       <l n="18">Into the street . You are a strange young man .</l>
       <l n="19">I know as much as that of you , for certain ;</l>
       <l n="20">And I 'm already praying , for your sake ,</l>
       <l n="21">That you be not too strange . Too much of that</l>
       <l n="22">May lead you bye and bye through gloomy lanes</l>
       <l n="23">To a sad wilderness , where one may grope</l>
       <l n="24">Alone , and always , or until he feels</l>
       <l n="25">Ferocious and invisible animals</l>
       <l n="26">That wait for men and eat them in the dark .</l>
       <l n="27">Why do you sit there on the floor so long ,</l>
       <l n="28">Smiling at me while I try to be solemn ?</l>
       <l n="29">Do you not hear it said for your salvation ,</l>
       <l n="30">When I say truth ? Are you , at four and twenty ,</l>
       <l n="31">So little deceived in us that you interpret</l>
       <l n="32">The humor of a woman to be noticed</l>
       <l n="33">As her choice between you and Acheron ?</l>
       <l n="34">Are you so unscathed yet as to infer</l>
       <l n="35">That if a woman worries when a man ,</l>
       <l n="36">Or a man-child , has wet shoes on his feet</l>
       <l n="37">She may as well commemorate with ashes</l>
       <l n="38">The last eclipse of her tranquillity ?</l>
       <l n="39">If you look up at me and blink again ,</l>
       <l n="40">I shall not have to make you tell me lies</l>
       <l n="41">To know the letters you have not been reading .</l>
       <l n="42">I see now that I may have had for nothing</l>
       <l n="43">A most unpleasant shivering in my conscience</l>
       <l n="44">When I laid open for your contemplation</l>
       <l n="45">The wealth of my worn casket . If I did ,</l>
       <l n="46">The fault was not yours wholly . Search again</l>
       <l n="47">This wreckage we may call for sport a face ,</l>
       <l n="48">And you may chance upon the price of havoc</l>
       <l n="49">That I have paid for a few sorry stones</l>
       <l n="50">That shine and have no light — yet once were stars ,</l>
       <l n="51">And sparkled on a crown . Little and weak</l>
       <l n="52">They seem ; and they are cold , I fear , for you .</l>
       <l n="53">But they that once were fire for me may not</l>
       <l n="54">Be cold again for me until I die ;</l>
       <l n="55">And only God knows if they may be then .</l>
       <l n="56">There is a love that ceases to be love</l>
       <l n="57">In being ourselves . How , then , are we to lose it ?</l>
       <l n="58">You that are sure that you know everything</l>
       <l n="59">There is to know of love , answer me that .</l>
       <l n="60">Well ? . . . You are not even interested .</l>

       <l n="61">Once on a far off time when I was young ,</l>
       <l n="62">I felt with your assurance , and all through me ,</l>
       <l n="63">That I had undergone the last and worst</l>
       <l n="64">Of love 's inventions . There was a boy who brought</l>
       <l n="65">The sun with him and woke me up with it ,</l>
       <l n="66">And that was every morning ; every night</l>
       <l n="67">I tried to dream of him , but never could ,</l>
       <l n="68">More than I might have seen in Adam 's eyes</l>
       <l n="69">Their fond uncertainty when Eve began</l>
       <l n="70">The play that all her tireless progeny</l>
       <l n="71">Are not yet weary of . One scene of it</l>
       <l n="72">Was brief , but was eternal while it lasted ;</l>
       <l n="73">And that was while I was the happiest</l>
       <l n="74">Of an imaginary six or seven ,</l>
       <l n="75">Somewhere in history but not on earth ,</l>
       <l n="76">For whom the sky had shaken and let stars</l>
       <l n="77">Rain down like diamonds . Then there were clouds ,</l>
       <l n="78">And a sad end of diamonds ; whereupon</l>
       <l n="79">Despair came , like a blast that would have brought</l>
       <l n="80">Tears to the eyes of all the bears in Finland ,</l>
       <l n="81">And love was done . That was how much I knew .</l>
       <l n="82">Poor little wretch ! I wonder where he is</l>
       <l n="83">This afternoon . Out of this rain , I hope .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="84">At last , when I had seen so many days</l>
       <l n="85">Dressed all alike , and in their marching order ,</l>
       <l n="86">Go by me that I would not always count them ,</l>
       <l n="87">One stopped — shattering the whole file of Time ,</l>
       <l n="88">Or so it seemed ; and when I looked again ,</l>
       <l n="89">There was a man . He struck once with his eyes ,</l>
       <l n="90">And then there was a woman . I , who had come</l>
       <l n="91">To wisdom , or to vision , or what you like ,</l>
       <l n="92">By the old hidden road that has no name , —</l>
       <l n="93">I , who was used to seeing without flying</l>
       <l n="94">So much that others fly from without seeing ,</l>
       <l n="95">Still looked , and was afraid , and looked again .</l>
       <l n="96">And after that , when I had read the story</l>
       <l n="97">Told in his eyes , and felt within my heart</l>
       <l n="98">The bleeding wound of their necessity ,</l>
       <l n="99">I knew the fear was his . If I had failed him</l>
       <l n="100">And flown away from him , I should have lost</l>
       <l n="101">Ingloriously my wings in scrambling back ,</l>
       <l n="102">And found them arms again . If he had struck me</l>
       <l n="103">Not only with his eyes but with his hands ,</l>
       <l n="104">I might have pitied him and hated love ,</l>
       <l n="105">And then gone mad . I , who have been so strong —</l>
       <l n="106">Why do n't you laugh ? — might even have done all that .</l>
       <l n="107">I , who have learned so much , and said so much ,</l>
       <l n="108">And had the commendations of the great</l>
       <l n="109">For one who rules herself — why do n't you cry ? —</l>
       <l n="110">And own a certain small authority</l>
       <l n="111">Among the blind , who see no more than ever ,</l>
       <l n="112">But like my voice , — I would have tossed it all</l>
       <l n="113">To Tophet for one man ; and he was jealous .</l>
       <l n="114">I would have wound a snake around my neck</l>
       <l n="115">And then have let it bite me till I died ,</l>
       <l n="116">If my so doing would have made me sure</l>
       <l n="117">That one man might have lived ; and he was jealous .</l>
       <l n="118">I would have driven these hands into a cage</l>
       <l n="119">That held a thousand scorpions , and crushed them ,</l>
       <l n="120">If only by so poisonous a trial</l>
       <l n="121">I could have crushed his doubt . I would have wrung</l>
       <l n="122">My living blood with mediaeval engines</l>
       <l n="123">Out of my screaming flesh , if only that</l>
       <l n="124">Would have made one man sure . I would have paid</l>
       <l n="125">For him the tiresome price of body and soul ,</l>
       <l n="126">And let the lash of a tongue-weary town</l>
       <l n="127">Fall as it might upon my blistered name ;</l>
       <l n="128">And while it fell I could have laughed at it ,</l>
       <l n="129">Knowing that he had found out finally</l>
       <l n="130">Where the wrong was . But there was evil in him</l>
       <l n="131">That would have made no more of his possession</l>
       <l n="132">Than confirmation of another fault ;</l>
       <l n="133">And there was honor — if you call it honor</l>
       <l n="134">That hoods itself with doubt and wears a crown</l>
       <l n="135">Of lead that might as well be gold and fire .</l>
       <l n="136">Give it as heavy or as light a name</l>
       <l n="137">As any there is that fits . I see myself</l>
       <l n="138">Without the power to swear to this or that</l>
       <l n="139">That I might be if he had been without it .</l>
       <l n="140">Whatever I might have been that I was not ,</l>
       <l n="141">It only happened that it was n't so .</l>
       <l n="142">Meanwhile , you might seem to be listening :</l>
       <l n="143">If you forget yourself and go to sleep ,</l>
       <l n="144">My treasure , I shall not say this again .</l>
       <l n="145">Look up once more into my poor old face ,</l>
       <l n="146">Where you see beauty , or the Lord knows what ,</l>
       <l n="147">And say to me aloud what else there is</l>
       <l n="148">Than ruins in it that you most admire .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="149">No , there was never anything like that ;</l>
       <l n="150">Nature has never fastened such a mask</l>
       <l n="151">Of radiant and impenetrable merit</l>
       <l n="152">On any woman as you say there is</l>
       <l n="153">On this one . Not a mask ? I thank you , sir ,</l>
       <l n="154">But you see more with your determination ,</l>
       <l n="155">I fear , than with your prudence or your conscience ;</l>
       <l n="156">And you have never met me with my eyes</l>
       <l n="157">In all the mirrors I 've made faces at .</l>
       <l n="158">No , I shall never call you strange again :</l>
       <l n="159">You are the young and inconvincible</l>
       <l n="160">Epitome of all blind men since Adam .</l>
       <l n="161">May the blind lead the blind , if that be so ?</l>
       <l n="162">And we shall need no mirrors ? You are saying</l>
       <l n="163">What most I feared you might . But if the blind ,</l>
       <l n="164">Or one of them , be not so fortunate</l>
       <l n="165">As to put out the eyes of recollection ,</l>
       <l n="166">She might at last , without her meaning it ,</l>
       <l n="167">Lead on the other , without his knowing it ,</l>
       <l n="168">Until the two of them should lose themselves</l>
       <l n="169">Among dead craters in a lava-field</l>
       <l n="170">As empty as a desert on the moon .</l>
       <l n="171">I am not speaking in a theatre ,</l>
       <l n="172">But in a room so real and so familiar</l>
       <l n="173">That sometimes I would wreck it . Then I pause ,</l>
       <l n="174">Remembering there is a King in Weimar —</l>
       <l n="175">A monarch , and a poet , and a shepherd</l>
       <l n="176">Of all who are astray and are outside</l>
       <l n="177">The realm where they should rule . I think of him ,</l>
       <l n="178">And save the furniture ; I think of you ,</l>
       <l n="179">And am forlorn , finding in you the one</l>
       <l n="180">To lavish aspirations and illusions</l>
       <l n="181">Upon a faded and forsaken house</l>
       <l n="182">Where love , being locked alone , was nigh to burning</l>
       <l n="183">House and himself together . Yes , you are strange ,</l>
       <l n="184">To see in such an injured architecture</l>
       <l n="185">Room for new love to live in . Are you laughing ?</l>
       <l n="186">No ? Well , you are not crying , as you should be .</l>
       <l n="187">Tears , even if they told only gratitude</l>
       <l n="188">For your escape , and had no other story ,</l>
       <l n="189">Were surely more becoming than a smile</l>
       <l n="190">For my unwomanly straightforwardness</l>
       <l n="191">In seeing for you , through my close gate of years</l>
       <l n="192">Your forty ways to freedom . Why do you smile ?</l>
       <l n="193">And while I 'm trembling at my faith in you</l>
       <l n="194">In giving you to read this book of danger</l>
       <l n="195">That only one man living might have written —</l>
       <l n="196">These letters , which have been a part of me</l>
       <l n="197">So long that you may read them all again</l>
       <l n="198">As often as you look into my face ,</l>
       <l n="199">And hear them when I speak to you , and feel them</l>
       <l n="200">Whenever you have to touch me with your hand , —</l>
       <l n="201">Why are you so unwilling to be spared ?</l>
       <l n="202">Why do you still believe in me ? But no ,</l>
       <l n="203">I 'll find another way to ask you that .</l>
       <l n="204">I wonder if there is another way</l>
       <l n="205">That says it better , and means anything .</l>
       <l n="206">There is no other way that could be worse ?</l>
       <l n="207">I was not asking you ; it was myself</l>
       <l n="208">Alone that I was asking . Why do I dip</l>
       <l n="209">For lies , when there is nothing in my well</l>
       <l n="210">But shining truth , you say ? How do you know ?</l>
       <l n="211">Truth has a lonely life down where she lives ;</l>
       <l n="212">And many a time , when she comes up to breathe ,</l>
       <l n="213">She sinks before we seize her , and makes ripples .</l>
       <l n="214">Possibly you may know no more of me</l>
       <l n="215">Than a few ripples ; and they may soon be gone ,</l>
       <l n="216">Leaving you then with all my shining truth</l>
       <l n="217">Drowned in a shining water ; and when you look</l>
       <l n="218">You may not see me there , but something else</l>
       <l n="219">That never was a woman — being yourself .</l>
       <l n="220">You say to me my truth is past all drowning ,</l>
       <l n="221">And safe with you for ever ? You know all that ?</l>
       <l n="222">How do you know all that , and who has told you ?</l>
       <l n="223">You know so much that I 'm an atom frightened</l>
       <l n="224">Because you know so little . And what is this ?</l>
       <l n="225">You know the luxury there is in haunting</l>
       <l n="226">The blasted thoroughfares of disillusion —</l>
       <l n="227">If that 's your name for them — with only ghosts</l>
       <l n="228">For company ? You know that when a woman</l>
       <l n="229">Is blessed , or cursed , with a divine impatience</l>
       <l n="230">( Another name of yours for a bad temper )</l>
       <l n="231">She must have one at hand on whom to wreak it</l>
       <l n="232">( That 's what you mean , whatever the turn you give it ) ,</l>
       <l n="233">Sure of a kindred sympathy , and thereby</l>
       <l n="234">Effect a mutual calm ? You know that wisdom ,</l>
       <l n="235">Given in vain to make a food for those</l>
       <l n="236">Who are without it , will be seen at last ,</l>
       <l n="237">And even at last only by those who gave it ,</l>
       <l n="238">As one or more of the forgotten crumbs</l>
       <l n="239">That others leave ? You know that men 's applause</l>
       <l n="240">And women 's envy savor so much of dust</l>
       <l n="241">That I go hungry , having at home no fare</l>
       <l n="242">But the same changeless bread that I may swallow</l>
       <l n="243">Only with tears and prayers ? Who told you that ?</l>
       <l n="244">You know that if I read , and read alone ,</l>
       <l n="245">Too many books that no men yet have written ,</l>
       <l n="246">I may go blind , or worse ? You know yourself ,</l>
       <l n="247">Of all insistent and insidious creatures ,</l>
       <l n="248">To be the one to save me , and to guard</l>
       <l n="249">For me their flaming language ? And you know</l>
       <l n="250">That if I give much headway to the whim</l>
       <l n="251">That 's in me never to be quite sure that even</l>
       <l n="252">Through all those years of storm and fire I waited</l>

       <l n="233">Only His eyes . And they looked into mine —</l>
       <l n="234">Long into mine , Mary , as if He knew . ”</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="17">
       <l n="235">Mary began to be afraid of words</l>
       <l n="236">As she had never been afraid before</l>
       <l n="237">Of loneliness or darkness , or of death ,</l>
       <l n="238">But now she must have more of them or die :</l>
       <l n="239">“ He cannot know that there is worse than death , ”</l>
       <l n="240">She said . “ And you . . . ”</l>

       <l n="241">“ Yes , there is worse than death . ”</l>

       <l n="243">And that is what it was that I could see</l>
       <l n="244">This morning in his eyes . I was afraid ,</l>
       <l n="245">But not as you are . There is worse than death ,</l>
       <l n="246">Mary ; and there is nothing that is good</l>
       <l n="247">For you in dying while you are still here .</l>
       <l n="248">Mary , never go back to that again .</l>
       <l n="249">You would not hear me if I told you more ,</l>
       <l n="250">For I should say it only in a language</l>
       <l n="251">That you are not to learn by going back .</l>
       <l n="252">To be a child again is to go forward —</l>
       <l n="253">And that is much to know . Many grow old ,</l>
       <l n="254">And fade , and go away , not knowing how much</l>
       <l n="255">That is to know . Mary , the night is coming ,</l>
       <l n="256">And there will soon be darkness all around you .</l>
       <l n="257">Let us go down where Martha waits for us ,</l>
       <l n="258">And let there be light shining in this house . ”</l>

       <l n="263">Is Nothing , Lazarus , all you have for me ?</l>

       <l n="276">Had He but held his peace and given his nod</l>
       <l n="277">To an old Law that would be new as any ?</l>
       <l n="278">I cannot say the answer to all that ;</l>
       <l n="279">Though I may say that He is not afraid ,</l>

       <l n="282">Of our futility that He is here .</l>
       <l n="283">Is that what you and Martha mean by Nothing ?</l>
       <l n="284">Is that what you are fearing ? If that be so ,</l>
       <l n="285">There are more weeds than lentils in your garden .</l>
       <l n="286">And one whose weeds are laughing at his harvest</l>
       <l n="287">May as well have no garden ; for not there</l>
       <l n="288">Shall he be gleaning the few bits and orts</l>

       <l n="292">Though now I see there 's yet an evil in me</l>
       <l n="293">That made me let you be afraid of me .</l>
       <l n="294">No , I was not afraid — not even of life .</l>
       <l n="295">I thought I was . . . I must have time for this ;</l>
       <l n="296">And all the time there is will not be long .</l>
       <l n="297">I cannot tell you what the Master saw</l>
       <l n="298">This morning in my eyes . I do not know .</l>
       <l n="299">I cannot yet say how far I have gone ,</l>
       <l n="300">Or why it is that I am here again ,</l>
       <l n="301">Or where the old road leads . I do not know .</l>
       <l n="302">I know that when I did come back , I saw</l>
       <l n="303">His eyes again among the trees and faces —</l>
       <l n="304">Only His eyes ; and they looked into mine —</l>
       <l n="305">Long into mine — long , long , as if He knew . ”</l>
