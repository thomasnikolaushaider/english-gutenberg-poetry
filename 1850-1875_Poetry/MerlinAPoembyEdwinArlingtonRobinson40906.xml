      <l n="5">“ Gawaine , Gawaine , what look ye for to see ,</l>
      <l n="6">So far beyond the faint edge of the world ?</l>
      <l n="7">D'ye look to see the lady Vivian ,</l>
      <l n="8">Pursued by divers ominous vile demons</l>
      <l n="9">That have another king more fierce than ours ?</l>
      <l n="10">Or think ye that if ye look far enough</l>
      <l n="11">And hard enough into the feathery west</l>
      <l n="12">Ye 'll have a glimmer of the Grail itself ?</l>
      <l n="13">And if ye look for neither Grail nor lady ,</l>
      <l n="14">What look ye for to see , Gawaine , Gawaine ? ”</l>
      <l n="15">So Dagonet , whom Arthur made a knight</l>
      <l n="16">Because he loved him as he laughed at him ,</l>
      <l n="17">Intoned his idle presence on a day</l>
      <l n="18">To Gawaine , who had thought himself alone ,</l>
      <l n="19">Had there been in him thought of anything</l>
      <l n="20">Save what was murmured now in Camelot</l>
      <l n="21">Of Merlin 's hushed and all but unconfirmed</l>
      <l n="22">Appearance out of Brittany . It was heard</l>
      <l n="23">At first there was a ghost in Arthur 's palace ,</l>
      <l n="24">But soon among the scullions and anon</l>
      <l n="25">Among the knights a firmer credit held</l>
      <l n="26">All tongues from uttering what all glances told —</l>
      <l n="27">Though not for long . Gawaine , this afternoon ,</l>
      <l n="28">Fearing he might say more to Lancelot</l>
      <l n="29">Of Merlin 's rumor-laden resurrection</l>
      <l n="30">Than Lancelot would have an ear to cherish ,</l>
      <l n="31">Had sauntered off with his imagination</l>
      <l n="32">To Merlin 's Rock , where now there was no Merlin</l>
      <l n="33">To meditate upon a whispering town</l>
      <l n="34">Below him in the silence .— Once he said</l>
      <l n="35">To Gawaine : “ You are young ; and that being so ,</l>
      <l n="36">Behold the shining city of our dreams</l>
      <l n="37">And of our King . ” — “ Long live the King , ” said Gawaine .—</l>
      <l n="38">“ Long live the King , ” said Merlin after him ;</l>
      <l n="39">“ Better for me that I shall not be King ;</l>
      <l n="40">Wherefore I say again , Long live the King ,</l>
      <l n="41">And add , God save him , also , and all kings —</l>
      <l n="42">All kings and queens . I speak in general .</l>
      <l n="43">Kings have I known that were but weary men</l>
      <l n="44">With no stout appetite for more than peace</l>
      <l n="45">That was not made for them . ” — “ Nor were they made</l>
      <l n="46">For kings , ” Gawaine said , laughing .— “ You are young</l>
      <l n="47">Gawaine , and you may one day hold the world</l>
      <l n="48">Between your fingers , knowing not what it is</l>
      <l n="49">That you are holding . Better for you and me ,</l>
      <l n="50">I think , that we shall not be kings . ”</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="4">
      <l n="51">Gawaine ,</l>
      <l n="52">Remembering Merlin 's words of long ago ,</l>
      <l n="53">Frowned as he thought , and having frowned again ,</l>
      <l n="54">He smiled and threw an acorn at a lizard :</l>
      <l n="55">“ There 's more afoot and in the air to-day</l>
      <l n="56">Than what is good for Camelot . Merlin</l>
      <l n="57">May or may not know all , but he said well</l>
      <l n="58">To say to me that he would not be King .</l>
      <l n="59">No more would I be King . ” Far down he gazed</l>
      <l n="60">On Camelot , until he made of it</l>
      <l n="61">A phantom town of many stillnesses ,</l>
      <l n="62">Not reared for men to dwell in , or for kings</l>
      <l n="63">To reign in , without omens and obscure</l>
      <l n="64">Familiars to bring terror to their days ;</l>
      <l n="65">For though a knight , and one as hard at arms</l>
      <l n="66">As any , save the fate-begotten few</l>
      <l n="67">That all acknowledged or in envy loathed ,</l>
      <l n="68">He felt a foreign sort of creeping up</l>
      <l n="69">And down him , as of moist things in the dark ,—</l>
      <l n="70">When Dagonet , coming on him unawares ,</l>
      <l n="71">Presuming on his title of Sir Fool ,</l>
      <l n="72">Addressed him and crooned on till he was done :</l>
      <l n="73">“ What look ye for to see , Gawaine , Gawaine ? ”</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="5">
      <l n="74">“ Sir Dagonet , you best and wariest</l>
      <l n="75">Of all dishonest men , I look through Time ,</l>
      <l n="76">For sight of what it is that is to be .</l>
      <l n="77">I look to see it , though I see it not .</l>
      <l n="78">I see a town down there that holds a king ,</l>
      <l n="79">And over it I see a few small clouds —</l>
      <l n="80">Like feathers in the west , as you observe ;</l>
      <l n="81">And I shall see no more this afternoon</l>
      <l n="82">Than what there is around us every day ,</l>
      <l n="83">Unless you have a skill that I have not</l>
      <l n="84">To ferret the invisible for rats . ”</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="6">
      <l n="85">“ If you see what 's around us every day ,</l>
      <l n="86">You need no other showing to go mad .</l>
      <l n="87">Remember that and take it home with you ;</l>
      <l n="88">And say tonight , ‘ I had it of a fool —</l>
      <l n="89">With no immediate obliquity</l>
      <l n="90">For this one or for that one , or for me . ’ ”</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="7">
      <l n="91">Gawaine , having risen , eyed the fool curiously :</l>
      <l n="92">“ I 'll not forget I had it of a knight ,</l>
      <l n="93">Whose only folly is to fool himself ;</l>
      <l n="94">And as for making other men to laugh ,</l>
      <l n="95">And so forget their sins and selves a little ,</l>
      <l n="96">There 's no great folly there . So keep it up ,</l>
      <l n="97">As long as you 've a legend or a song ,</l>
      <l n="98">And have whatever sport of us you like</l>
      <l n="99">Till havoc is the word and we fall howling .</l>
      <l n="100">For I 've a guess there may not be so loud</l>
      <l n="101">A sound of laughing here in Camelot</l>
      <l n="102">When Merlin goes again to his gay grave</l>
      <l n="103">In Brittany . To mention lesser terrors ,</l>
      <l n="104">Men say his beard is gone . ”</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="8">
      <l n="105">“ Do men say that ? ”</l>
      <l n="106">A twitch of an impatient weariness</l>
      <l n="107">Played for a moment over the lean face</l>
      <l n="108">Of Dagonet , who reasoned inwardly :</l>
      <l n="109">“ The friendly zeal of this inquiring knight</l>
      <l n="110">Will overtake his tact and leave it squealing ,</l>
      <l n="111">One of these days . ” — Gawaine looked hard at him :</l>
      <l n="112">“ If I be too familiar with a fool ,</l>
      <l n="113">I 'm on the way to be another fool , ”</l>
      <l n="114">He mused , and owned a rueful qualm within him :</l>
      <l n="115">“ Yes , Dagonet , ” he ventured , with a laugh ,</l>
      <l n="116">“ Men tell me that his beard has vanished wholly ,</l>
      <l n="117">And that he shines now as the Lord 's anointed ,</l>
      <l n="118">And wears the valiance of an ageless youth</l>
      <l n="119">Crowned with a glory of eternal peace . ”</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="9">
      <l n="120">Dagonet , smiling strangely , shook his head :</l>
      <l n="121">“ I grant your valiance of a kind of youth</l>
      <l n="122">To Merlin , but your crown of peace I question ;</l>
      <l n="123">For , though I know no more than any churl</l>
      <l n="124">Who pinches any chambermaid soever</l>
      <l n="125">In the King 's palace , I look not to Merlin</l>
      <l n="126">For peace , when out of his peculiar tomb</l>
      <l n="127">He comes again to Camelot . Time swings</l>
      <l n="128">A mighty scythe , and some day all your peace</l>
      <l n="129">Goes down before its edge like so much clover .</l>
      <l n="130">No , it is not for peace that Merlin comes ,</l>
      <l n="131">Without a trumpet — and without a beard ,</l>
      <l n="132">If what you say men say of him be true —</l>
      <l n="133">Nor yet for sudden war . ”</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="10">
      <l n="134">Gawaine , for a moment ,</l>
      <l n="135">Met then the ambiguous gaze of Dagonet ,</l>
      <l n="136">And , making nothing of it , looked abroad</l>
      <l n="137">As if at something cheerful on all sides ,</l>
      <l n="138">And back again to the fool 's unasking eyes :</l>
      <l n="139">“ Well , Dagonet , if Merlin would have peace ,</l>
      <l n="140">Let Merlin stay away from Brittany , ”</l>
      <l n="141">Said he , with admiration for the man</l>
      <l n="142">Whom Folly called a fool : “ And we have known him ;</l>
      <l n="143">We knew him once when he knew everything . ”</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="11">
      <l n="144">“ He knew as much as God would let him know</l>
      <l n="145">Until he met the lady Vivian .</l>
      <l n="146">I tell you that , for the world knows all that ;</l>
      <l n="147">Also it knows he told the King one day</l>
      <l n="148">That he was to be buried , and alive ,</l>
      <l n="149">In Brittany ; and that the King should see</l>
      <l n="150">The face of him no more . Then Merlin sailed</l>
      <l n="151">Away to Vivian in Broceliande ,</l>
      <l n="152">Where now she crowns him and herself with flowers ,</l>
      <l n="153">And feeds him fruits and wines and many foods</l>
      <l n="154">Of many savors , and sweet ortolans .</l>
      <l n="155">Wise books of every lore of every land</l>
      <l n="156">Are there to fill his days , if he require them ,</l>
      <l n="157">And there are players of all instruments —</l>
      <l n="158">Flutes , hautboys , drums , and viols ; and she sings</l>
      <l n="159">To Merlin , till he trembles in her arms</l>
      <l n="160">And there forgets that any town alive</l>
      <l n="161">Had ever such a name as Camelot .</l>
      <l n="162">So Vivian holds him with her love , they say ,</l>
      <l n="163">And he , who has no age , has not grown old .</l>
      <l n="164">I swear to nothing , but that 's what they say .</l>
      <l n="165">That 's being buried in Broceliande</l>
      <l n="166">For too much wisdom and clairvoyancy .</l>
      <l n="167">But you and all who live , Gawaine , have heard</l>
      <l n="168">This tale , or many like it , more than once ;</l>
      <l n="169">And you must know that Love , when Love invites</l>
      <l n="170">Philosophy to play , plays high and wins ,</l>
      <l n="171">Or low and loses . And you say to me ,</l>
      <l n="172">‘ If Merlin would have peace , let Merlin stay</l>
      <l n="173">Away from Brittany . ’ Gawaine , you are young ,</l>
      <l n="174">And Merlin 's in his grave . ”</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="12">
      <l n="175">“ Merlin said once</l>
      <l n="176">That I was young , and it 's a joy for me</l>

      <l n="178">Young or not young , if that be burial ,</l>
      <l n="179">May I be buried long before I die .</l>
      <l n="180">I might be worse than young ; I might be old . ” —</l>
      <l n="181">Dagonet answered , and without a smile :</l>
      <l n="182">“ Somehow I fancy Merlin saying that ;</l>
      <l n="183">A fancy — a mere fancy . ” Then he smiled :</l>
      <l n="184">“ And such a doom as his may be for you ,</l>
      <l n="185">Gawaine , should your untiring divination</l>
      <l n="186">Delve in the veiled eternal mysteries</l>
      <l n="187">Too far to be a pleasure for the Lord .</l>
      <l n="188">And when you stake your wisdom for a woman ,</l>
      <l n="189">Compute the woman to be worth a grave ,</l>
      <l n="190">As Merlin did , and say no more about it .</l>
      <l n="191">But Vivian , she played high . Oh , very high !</l>
      <l n="192">Flutes , hautboys , drums , and viols ,— and her love .</l>
      <l n="193">Gawaine , farewell . ”</l>

     <lg type="stanza" n="13">
      <l n="194">“ Farewell , Sir Dagonet ,</l>
      <l n="195">And may the devil take you presently . ”</l>
      <l n="196">He followed with a vexed and envious eye ,</l>
      <l n="197">And with an arid laugh , Sir Dagonet 's</l>
      <l n="198">Departure , till his gaunt obscurity</l>
      <l n="199">Was cloaked and lost amid the glimmering trees .</l>
      <l n="200">“ Poor fool ! ” he murmured . “ Or am I the fool ?</l>
      <l n="201">With all my fast ascendency in arms ,</l>
      <l n="202">That ominous clown is nearer to the King</l>
      <l n="203">Than I am — yet ; and God knows what he knows ,</l>
      <l n="204">And what his wits infer from what he sees</l>
      <l n="205">And feels and hears . I wonder what he knows</l>
      <l n="206">Of Lancelot , or what I might know now ,</l>
      <l n="207">Could I have sunk myself to sound a fool</l>
      <l n="208">To springe a friend .... No , I like not this day .</l>
      <l n="209">There 's a cloud coming over Camelot</l>
      <l n="210">Larger than any that is in the sky ,—</l>
      <l n="211">Or Merlin would be still in Brittany ,</l>
      <l n="212">With Vivian and the viols . It 's all too strange . ”</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="14">
      <l n="213">And later , when descending to the city ,</l>
      <l n="214">Through unavailing casements he could hear</l>
      <l n="215">The roaring of a mighty voice within ,</l>
      <l n="216">Confirming fervidly his own conviction :</l>
      <l n="217">“ It 's all too strange , and half the world 's half crazy ! ” —</l>
      <l n="218">He scowled : “ Well , I agree with Lamorak . ”</l>
      <l n="219">He frowned , and passed : “ And I like not this day . ”</l>

     <lg type="stanza" n="15">
      <l n="220">Sir Lamorak , the man of oak and iron ,</l>
      <l n="221">Had with him now , as a care-laden guest ,</l>

      <l n="224">Like one whose late-flown shaft of argument</l>
      <l n="225">Had glanced and fallen afield innocuously ,</l>
      <l n="226">He turned upon his host a sudden eye</l>
      <l n="227">That met from Lamorak 's an even shaft</l>
      <l n="228">Of native and unused authority ;</l>

      <l n="789">Or long to be disowned , or manageable .</l>
      <l n="790">She thought of him as he had looked at her</l>
      <l n="791">When first he had acquainted her alarm</l>
      <l n="792">At sight of the King 's letter with its import ;</l>
      <l n="793">And she remembered now his very words :</l>
      <l n="794">“ The King believes today as in his boyhood</l>
      <l n="795">That I am Fate , ” he said ; and when they parted</l>
      <l n="796">She had not even asked him not to go ;</l>
      <l n="797">She might as well , she thought , have bid the wind</l>
      <l n="798">Throw no more clouds across a lonely sky</l>
      <l n="799">Between her and the moon ,— so great he seemed</l>
      <l n="800">In his oppressed solemnity , and she ,</l>
      <l n="801">In her excess of wrong imagining ,</l>
      <l n="802">So trivial in an hour , and , after all</l>
      <l n="803">A creature of a smaller consequence</l>
      <l n="804">Than kings to Merlin , who made kings and kingdoms</l>
      <l n="805">And had them as a father ; and so she feared</l>
      <l n="806">King Arthur more than robbers while she waited</l>
      <l n="807">For Merlin 's promise to fulfil itself ,</l>
      <l n="808">And for the rest that was to follow after :</l>
      <l n="809">“ He said he would come back , and so he will .</l>
      <l n="810">He will because he must , and he is Merlin ,</l>
      <l n="811">The master of the world — or so he was ;</l>
      <l n="812">And he is coming back again to me</l>
      <l n="813">Because he must and I am Vivian .</l>
      <l n="814">It 's all as easy as two added numbers :</l>
      <l n="815">Some day I 'll hear him ringing at the gate ,</l>
      <l n="816">As he rang on that morning in the spring ,</l>
      <l n="817">Ten years ago ; and I shall have him then</l>
      <l n="818">For ever . He shall never go away</l>
      <l n="819">Though kings come walking on their hands and knees</l>
      <l n="820">To take him on their backs . ” When Merlin came ,</l>
      <l n="821">She told him that , and laughed ; and he said strangely :</l>
      <l n="822">“ Be glad or sorry , but no kings are coming .</l>
      <l n="823">Not Arthur , surely ; for now Arthur knows</l>
      <l n="824">That I am less than Fate . ”</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="40">
      <l n="825">Ten years ago</l>
      <l n="826">The King had heard , with unbelieving ears</l>
      <l n="827">At first , what Merlin said would be the last</l>
      <l n="828">Reiteration of his going down</l>
      <l n="829">To find a living grave in Brittany :</l>
      <l n="830">“ Buried alive I told you I should be ,</l>
      <l n="831">By love made little and by woman shorn ,</l>
      <l n="832">Like Samson , of my glory ; and the time</l>
      <l n="833">Is now at hand . I follow in the morning</l>
      <l n="834">Where I am led . I see behind me now</l>
      <l n="835">The last of crossways , and I see before me</l>
      <l n="836">A straight and final highway to the end</l>
      <l n="837">Of all my divination . You are King ,</l>
      <l n="838">And in your kingdom I am what I was .</l>
      <l n="839">Wherever I have warned you , see as far</l>

      <l n="842">For I can be no more than what I was . ”</l>
      <l n="843">So , on the morrow , the King said farewell ;</l>
      <l n="844">And he was never more to Merlin 's eye</l>
      <l n="845">The King than at that hour ; for Merlin knew</l>
      <l n="846">How much was going out of Arthur 's life</l>
      <l n="847">With him , as he went southward to the sea .</l>

     <lg type="stanza" n="41">
      <l n="848">Over the waves and into Brittany</l>

      <l n="850">Were singing high to greet him all along</l>
      <l n="851">A broad and sanded woodland avenue</l>
      <l n="852">That led him on forever , so he thought ,</l>
      <l n="853">Until at last there was an end of it ;</l>
      <l n="854">And at the end there was a gate of iron ,</l>

      <l n="856">He pulled a cord that rang somewhere a bell</l>
      <l n="857">Of many echoes , and sat down to rest ,</l>
      <l n="858">Outside the keeper 's house , upon a bench</l>
      <l n="859">Of carven stone that might for centuries</l>
      <l n="860">Have waited there in silence to receive him .</l>
      <l n="861">The birds were singing still ; leaves flashed and swung</l>
      <l n="862">Before him in the sunlight ; a soft breeze</l>
      <l n="863">Made intermittent whisperings around him</l>
      <l n="864">Of love and fate and danger , and faint waves</l>
      <l n="865">Of many sweetly-stinging fragile odors</l>
      <l n="866">Broke lightly as they touched him ; cherry-boughs</l>
      <l n="867">Above him snowed white petals down upon him ,</l>
      <l n="868">And under their slow falling Merlin smiled</l>
      <l n="869">Contentedly , as one who contemplates</l>
      <l n="870">No longer fear , confusion , or regret ,</l>
      <l n="871">May smile at ruin or at revelation .</l>

     <lg type="stanza" n="42">
      <l n="872">A stately fellow with a forest air</l>

      <l n="895">The stately messenger , now bowing low</l>

      <l n="922">But edged anon with rays of broken sunshine</l>
      <l n="923">In which a fountain , raining crystal music ,</l>
      <l n="924">Made faery magic of it through green leafage ,</l>
      <l n="925">Till Merlin 's eyes were dim with preparation</l>
      <l n="926">For sight now of the lady Vivian .</l>
      <l n="927">He saw at first a bit of living green</l>

      <l n="929">Around the tinkling fountain where she gazed</l>
      <l n="930">Upon the circling pool as if her thoughts</l>
      <l n="931">Were not so much on Merlin — whose advance</l>
      <l n="932">Betrayed through his enormity of hair</l>
      <l n="933">The cheeks and eyes of youth — as on the fishes .</l>
      <l n="934">But soon she turned and found him , now alone ,</l>
      <l n="935">And held him while her beauty and her grace</l>
      <l n="936">Made passing trash of empires , and his eyes</l>
      <l n="937">Told hers of what a splendid emptiness</l>
      <l n="938">Her tedious world had been without him in it</l>
      <l n="939">Whose love and service were to be her school ,</l>
      <l n="940">Her triumph , and her history : “ This is Merlin , ”</l>

      <l n="956">She smiled and welcomed him ; and so they stood ,</l>

      <l n="1010">A moment 's worth of wisdom there escaped him ,</l>

      <l n="1069">A life that is no life . Would you go back</l>
      <l n="1070">To Camelot ? ” — Merlin shook his head again ,</l>
      <l n="1071">And the two smiled together in the sunset .</l>

     <lg type="stanza" n="49">
      <l n="1072">They moved along in silence to the door ,</l>
      <l n="1073">Where Merlin said : “ Of your three hundred here</l>
      <l n="1074">There is but one I know , and him I favor ;</l>
      <l n="1075">I mean the stately one who shakes the keys</l>
      <l n="1076">Of that most evil sounding gate of yours ,</l>
      <l n="1077">Which has a clang as if it shut forever . ” —</l>
      <l n="1078">“ If there be need , I 'll shut the gate myself , ”</l>
      <l n="1079">She said . “ And you like Blaise ? Then you shall have him .</l>
      <l n="1080">He was not born to serve , but serve he must ,</l>
      <l n="1081">It seems , and be enamoured of my shadow .</l>
      <l n="1082">He cherishes the taint of some high folly</l>
      <l n="1083">That haunts him with a name he cannot know ,</l>
      <l n="1084">And I could fear his wits are paying for it .</l>
      <l n="1085">Forgive his tongue , and humor it a little . ” —</l>
      <l n="1086">“ I knew another one whose name was Blaise , ”</l>
      <l n="1087">He said ; and she said lightly , “ Well , what of it ? ” —</l>
      <l n="1088">“ And he was nigh the learnedest of hermits ;</l>
      <l n="1089">His home was far away from everywhere ,</l>
      <l n="1090">And he was all alone there when he died . ” —</l>
      <l n="1091">“ Now be a pleasant Merlin , ” Vivian said ,</l>
      <l n="1092">Patting his arm , “ and have no more of that ;</l>
      <l n="1093">For I 'll not hear of dead men far away ,</l>
      <l n="1094">Or dead men anywhere this afternoon .</l>
      <l n="1095">There 'll be a trifle in the way of supper</l>
      <l n="1096">This evening , but the dead shall not have any .</l>
      <l n="1097">Blaise and this man will tell you all there is</l>
      <l n="1098">For you to know . Then you 'll know everything . ”</l>
      <l n="1099">She laughed , and vanished like a humming-bird .</l>

      <l n="1100">The sun went down , and the dark after it</l>
      <l n="1101">Starred Merlin 's new abode with many a sconced</l>
      <l n="1102">And many a moving candle , in whose light</l>
      <l n="1103">The prisoned wizard , mirrored in amazement ,</l>
      <l n="1104">Saw fronting him a stranger , falcon-eyed ,</l>
      <l n="1105">Firm-featured , of a negligible age ,</l>
      <l n="1106">And fair enough to look upon , he fancied ,</l>
      <l n="1107">Though not a warrior born , nor more a courtier .</l>
      <l n="1108">A native humor resting in his long</l>
      <l n="1109">And solemn jaws now stirred , and Merlin smiled</l>
      <l n="1110">To see himself in purple , touched with gold ,</l>
      <l n="1111">And fledged with snowy lace .— The careful Blaise ,</l>
      <l n="1112">Having drawn some time before from Merlin 's wallet</l>
      <l n="1113">The sable raiment of a royal scholar ,</l>
      <l n="1114">Had eyed it with a long mistrust and said :</l>
      <l n="1115">“ The lady Vivian would be vexed , I fear ,</l>
      <l n="1116">To meet you vested in these learned weeds</l>
      <l n="1117">Of gravity and death ; for she abhors</l>
      <l n="1118">Mortality in all its hues and emblems —</l>
      <l n="1119">Black wear , long argument , and all the cold</l>
      <l n="1120">And solemn things that appertain to graves . ” —</l>
      <l n="1121">And Merlin , listening , to himself had said ,</l>
      <l n="1122">“ This fellow has a freedom , yet I like him ; ”</l>
      <l n="1123">And then aloud : “ I trust you . Deck me out ,</l>
      <l n="1124">However , with a temperate regard</l>
      <l n="1125">For what your candid eye may find in me</l>
      <l n="1126">Of inward coloring . Let them reap my beard ,</l>
      <l n="1127">Moreover , with a sort of reverence ,</l>
      <l n="1128">For I shall never look on it again .</l>
      <l n="1129">And though your lady frown her face away</l>
      <l n="1130">To think of me in black , for God 's indulgence ,</l>
      <l n="1131">Array me not in scarlet or in yellow . ” —</l>
      <l n="1132">And so it came to pass that Merlin sat</l>
      <l n="1133">At ease in purple , even though his chin</l>
      <l n="1134">Reproached him as he pinched it , and seemed yet</l>
      <l n="1135">A little fearful of its nakedness .</l>
      <l n="1136">He might have sat and scanned himself for ever</l>
      <l n="1137">Had not the careful Blaise , regarding him ,</l>
      <l n="1138">Remarked again that in his proper judgment ,</l>
      <l n="1139">And on the valid word of his attendants ,</l>
      <l n="1140">No more was to be done . “ Then do no more , ”</l>
      <l n="1141">Said Merlin , with a last look at his chin ;</l>
      <l n="1142">“ Never do more when there 's no more to do ,</l>
      <l n="1143">And you may shun thereby the bitter taste</l>
      <l n="1144">Of many disillusions and regrets .</l>
      <l n="1145">God 's pity on us that our words have wings</l>
      <l n="1146">And leave our deeds to crawl so far below them ;</l>

      <l n="1148">Whether we lead or follow , rule or serve . ” —</l>
      <l n="1149">“ God 's pity on us anyhow , ” Blaise answered ,</l>
      <l n="1150">“ Or most of us . Meanwhile , I have to say ,</l>
      <l n="1151">As long as you are here , and I 'm alive ,</l>
      <l n="1152">Your summons will assure the loyalty</l>
      <l n="1153">Of all my diligence and expedition .</l>
      <l n="1154">The gong that you hear singing in the distance</l>
      <l n="1155">Was rung for your attention and your presence . ” —</l>
      <l n="1156">“ I wonder at this fellow , yet I like him , ”</l>
      <l n="1157">Said Merlin ; and he rose to follow him .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="51">
      <l n="1158">The lady Vivian in a fragile sheath</l>
      <l n="1159">Of crimson , dimmed and veiled ineffably</l>
      <l n="1160">By the flame-shaken gloom wherein she sat ,</l>
      <l n="1161">And twinkled if she moved , heard Merlin coming ,</l>
      <l n="1162">And smiled as if to make herself believe</l>
      <l n="1163">Her joy was all a triumph ; yet her blood</l>
      <l n="1164">Confessed a tingling of more wonderment</l>
      <l n="1165">Than all her five and twenty worldly years</l>
      <l n="1166">Of waiting for this triumph could remember ;</l>
      <l n="1167">And when she knew and felt the slower tread</l>
      <l n="1168">Of his unseen advance among the shadows</l>
      <l n="1169">To the small haven of uncertain light</l>
      <l n="1170">That held her in it as a torch-lit shoal</l>
      <l n="1171">Might hold a smooth red fish , her listening skin</l>
      <l n="1172">Responded with a creeping underneath it ,</l>
      <l n="1173">And a crinkling that was incident alike</l>
      <l n="1174">To darkness , love , and mice . When he was there ,</l>
      <l n="1175">She looked up at him in a whirl of mirth</l>
      <l n="1176">And wonder , as in childhood she had gazed</l>
      <l n="1177">Wide-eyed on royal mountebanks who made</l>
      <l n="1178">So brief a shift of the impossible</l>
      <l n="1179">That kings and queens would laugh and shake themselves ;</l>
      <l n="1180">Then rising slowly on her little feet ,</l>
      <l n="1181">Like a slim creature lifted , she thrust out</l>
      <l n="1182">Her two small hands as if to push him back —</l>
      <l n="1183">Whereon he seized them . “ Go away , ” she said ;</l>
      <l n="1184">“ I never saw you in my life before . ” —</l>
      <l n="1185">“ You say the truth , ” he answered ; “ when I met</l>
      <l n="1186">Myself an hour ago , my words were yours .</l>
      <l n="1187">God made the man you see for you to like ,</l>
      <l n="1188">If possible . If otherwise , turn down</l>
      <l n="1189">These two prodigious and remorseless thumbs</l>
      <l n="1190">And leave your lions to annihilate him . ” —</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="52">
      <l n="1191">“ I have no other lion than yourself , ”</l>
      <l n="1192">She said ; “ and since you cannot eat yourself ,</l>
      <l n="1193">Pray do a lonely woman , who is , you say ,</l>
      <l n="1194">More like a tree than any other thing</l>
      <l n="1195">In your discrimination , the large honor</l>
      <l n="1196">Of sharing with her a small kind of supper . ” —</l>
      <l n="1197">“ Yes , you are like a tree ,— or like a flower ;</l>
      <l n="1198">More like a flower to-night . ” He bowed his head</l>
      <l n="1199">And kissed the ten small fingers he was holding ,</l>
      <l n="1200">As calmly as if each had been a son ;</l>
      <l n="1201">Although his heart was leaping and his eyes</l>
      <l n="1202">Had sight for nothing save a swimming crimson</l>
      <l n="1203">Between two glimmering arms . “ More like a flower</l>
      <l n="1204">To-night , ” he said , as now he scanned again</l>
      <l n="1205">The immemorial meaning of her face</l>
      <l n="1206">And drew it nearer to his eyes . It seemed</l>
      <l n="1207">A flower of wonder with a crimson stem</l>
      <l n="1208">Came leaning slowly and regretfully</l>
      <l n="1209">To meet his will — a flower of change and peril</l>
      <l n="1210">That had a clinging blossom of warm olive</l>
      <l n="1211">Half stifled with a tyranny of black ,</l>
      <l n="1212">And held the wayward fragrance of a rose</l>
      <l n="1213">Made woman by delirious alchemy .</l>
      <l n="1214">She raised her face and yoked his willing neck</l>
      <l n="1215">With half her weight ; and with hot lips that left</l>
      <l n="1216">The world with only philosophy</l>
      <l n="1217">For Merlin or for Anaxagoras ,</l>
      <l n="1218">Called his to meet them and in one long hush</l>
      <l n="1219">Of capture to surrender and make hers</l>
      <l n="1220">The last of anything that might remain</l>
      <l n="1221">Of what were now their beardless wizardry .</l>
      <l n="1222">Then slowly she began to push herself</l>
      <l n="1223">Away , and slowly Merlin let her go</l>
      <l n="1224">As far from him as his outreaching hands</l>
      <l n="1225">Could hold her fingers while his eyes had all</l>
      <l n="1226">The beauty of the woodland and the world</l>
      <l n="1227">Before him in the firelight , like a nymph</l>
      <l n="1228">Of cities , or a queen a little weary</l>
      <l n="1229">Of inland stillness and immortal trees .</l>
      <l n="1230">“ Are you to let me go again sometime , ”</l>
      <l n="1231">She said ,— “ before I starve to death , I wonder ?</l>
      <l n="1232">If not , I 'll have to bite the lion 's paws ,</l>
      <l n="1233">And make him roar . He cannot shake his mane ,</l>
      <l n="1234">For now the lion has no mane to shake ;</l>
      <l n="1235">The lion hardly knows himself without it ,</l>
      <l n="1236">And thinks he has no face , but there 's a lady</l>
      <l n="1237">Who says he had no face until he lost it .</l>
      <l n="1238">So there we are . And there 's a flute somewhere ,</l>
      <l n="1239">Playing a strange old tune . You know the words :</l>

     <lg type="stanza" n="53">
      <l n="1241">Fatigue and hunger — tempered leisurely</l>

      <l n="1243">Might after many failures have delivered ,</l>
      <l n="1244">And wine that had for decades in the dark</l>
      <l n="1245">Of Merlin 's grave been slowly quickening ,</l>
      <l n="1246">And with half-heard , dream-weaving interludes</l>
      <l n="1247">Of distant flutes and viols , made yet more distant</l>
      <l n="1248">By far , nostalgic hautboys blown from nowhere ,—</l>
      <l n="1249">Were tempered not so leisurely , may be ,</l>
      <l n="1250">With Vivian 's inextinguishable eyes</l>
      <l n="1251">Between two shining silver candlesticks</l>

      <l n="1253">The rest of her a dusky loveliness</l>
      <l n="1254">Against a bank of shadow . Merlin made ,</l>
      <l n="1255">As well as he was able while he ate ,</l>
      <l n="1256">A fair division of the fealty due</l>
      <l n="1257">To food and beauty , albeit more times than one</l>

      <l n="1342">And far from always . You are more than kings</l>
      <l n="1343">To me ; therefore I give it all to you ,</l>

      <l n="1349">Annoying me until it fades and sours</l>

      <l n="1352">On unexpected ruins , and thrift itself</l>
      <l n="1353">May be a kind of slow unwholesome fire</l>

      <l n="1366">“ There 's only this much in the world of it ,</l>

      <l n="1369">With a long-kindling gaze that caught from hers</l>
      <l n="1370">A laughing flame , and with a hand that shook</l>
      <l n="1371">Like Arthur 's kingdom , Merlin slowly raised</l>
      <l n="1372">A golden cup that for a golden moment</l>
      <l n="1373">Was twinned in air with hers ; and Vivian ,</l>
      <l n="1374">Who smiled at him across their gleaming rims ,</l>
      <l n="1375">From eyes that made a fuel of the night</l>
      <l n="1376">Surrounding her , shot glory over gold</l>
      <l n="1377">At Merlin , while their cups touched and his trembled .</l>

      <l n="1383">Through sheathing crimson into candle-light</l>
      <l n="1384">With each new leer of their loose , liquorish eyes .</l>
      <l n="1385">Again he drank , and he cursed every king</l>
      <l n="1386">Who might have touched her even in her cradle ;</l>
      <l n="1387">For what were kings to such as he , who made them</l>
      <l n="1388">And saw them totter — for the world to see ,</l>
      <l n="1389">And heed , if the world would ? He drank again ,</l>
      <l n="1390">And yet again — to make himself assured</l>
      <l n="1391">No manner of king should have the last of it —</l>
      <l n="1392">The cup that Vivian filled unfailingly</l>
      <l n="1393">Until she poured for nothing . “ At the end</l>
      <l n="1394">Of this incomparable flowing gold , ”</l>
      <l n="1395">She prattled on to Merlin , who observed</l>
      <l n="1396">Her solemnly , “ I fear there may be specks . ” —</l>
      <l n="1397">He sighed aloud , whereat she laughed at him</l>
      <l n="1398">And pushed the golden cup a little nearer .</l>
      <l n="1399">He scanned it with a sad anxiety ,</l>
      <l n="1400">And then her face likewise , and shook his head</l>
      <l n="1401">As if at her concern for such a matter :</l>
      <l n="1402">“ Specks ? What are specks ? Are you afraid of them ? ”</l>
      <l n="1403">He murmured slowly , with a drowsy tongue ;</l>
      <l n="1404">“ There are specks everywhere . I fear them not .</l>
      <l n="1405">If I were king in Camelot , I might</l>
      <l n="1406">Fear more than specks . But now I fear them not .</l>

     <lg type="stanza" n="58">
      <l n="1408">He stared a long time at the cup of gold</l>
      <l n="1409">Before him but he drank no more . There came</l>
      <l n="1410">Between him and the world a crumbling sky</l>
      <l n="1411">Of black and crimson , with a crimson cloud</l>
      <l n="1412">That held a far off town of many towers ,</l>
      <l n="1413">All swayed and shaken , till at last they fell ,</l>
      <l n="1414">And there was nothing but a crimson cloud</l>
      <l n="1415">That crumbled into nothing , like the sky</l>
      <l n="1416">That vanished with it , carrying away</l>
      <l n="1417">The world , the woman , and all memory of them ,</l>
      <l n="1418">Until a slow light of another sky</l>
      <l n="1419">Made gray an open casement , showing him</l>
      <l n="1420">Faint shapes of an exotic furniture</l>
      <l n="1421">That glimmered with a dim magnificence ,</l>
      <l n="1422">And letting in the sound of many birds</l>
      <l n="1423">That were , as he lay there remembering ,</l>
      <l n="1424">The only occupation of his ears</l>
      <l n="1425">Until it seemed they shared a fainter sound ,</l>
      <l n="1426">As if a sleeping child with a black head</l>

      <l n="1428">One shining afternoon around the fountain ,</l>
      <l n="1429">As on the shining day of his arrival ,</l>
      <l n="1430">The sunlight was alive with flying silver</l>
      <l n="1431">That had for Merlin a more dazzling flash</l>
      <l n="1432">Than jewels rained in dreams , and a richer sound</l>
      <l n="1433">Than harps , and all the morning stars together ,—</l>
      <l n="1434">When jewels and harps and stars and everything</l>
      <l n="1435">That flashed and sang and was not Vivian ,</l>
      <l n="1436">Seemed less than echoes of her least of words —</l>
      <l n="1437">For she was coming . Suddenly , somewhere</l>
      <l n="1438">Behind him , she was coming ; that was all</l>
      <l n="1439">He knew until she came and took his hand</l>
      <l n="1440">And held it while she talked about the fishes .</l>
      <l n="1441">When she looked up he thought a softer light</l>
      <l n="1442">Was in her eyes than once he had found there ;</l>
      <l n="1443">And had there been left yet for dusky women</l>
      <l n="1444">A beauty that was heretofore not hers ,</l>
      <l n="1445">He told himself he must have seen it then</l>
      <l n="1446">Before him in the face at which he smiled</l>
      <l n="1447">And trembled . “ Many men have called me wise , ”</l>
      <l n="1448">He said , “ but you are wiser than all wisdom</l>
      <l n="1449">If you know what you are . ” — “ I do n't , ” she said ;</l>
      <l n="1450">“ I know that you and I are here together ;</l>
      <l n="1451">I know that I have known for twenty years</l>
      <l n="1452">That life would be almost a constant yawning</l>
      <l n="1453">Until you came ; and now that you are here ,</l>
      <l n="1454">I know that you are not to go away</l>
      <l n="1455">Until you tell me that I 'm hideous ;</l>
      <l n="1456">I know that I like fishes , ferns , and snakes ,—</l>
      <l n="1457">Maybe because I liked them when the world</l>

      <l n="1459">I know , too , a cool place not far from here ,</l>
      <l n="1460">Where there are ferns that are like marching men</l>
      <l n="1461">Who never march away . Come now and see them ,</l>
      <l n="1462">And do as they do — never march away .</l>
      <l n="1463">When they are gone , some others , crisp and green ,</l>
      <l n="1464">Will have their place , but never march away . ” —</l>
      <l n="1465">He smoothed her silky fingers , one by one :</l>
      <l n="1466">“ Some other Merlin , also , do you think ,</l>
      <l n="1467">Will have his place — and never march away ? ” —</l>
      <l n="1468">Then Vivian laid a finger on his lips</l>
      <l n="1469">And shook her head at him before she laughed :</l>
      <l n="1470">“ There is no other Merlin than yourself ,</l>
      <l n="1471">And you are never going to be old . ”</l>
      <l n="1472">Oblivious of a world that made of him</l>
      <l n="1473">A jest , a legend , and a long regret ,</l>
      <l n="1474">And with a more commanding wizardry</l>
      <l n="1475">Than his to rule a kingdom where the king</l>

      <l n="1477">His queen without the blemish of a word</l>
      <l n="1478">That was more rough than honey from her lips ,</l>
      <l n="1479">Or the first adumbration of a frown</l>
      <l n="1480">To cloud the night-wild fire that in her eyes</l>
      <l n="1481">Had yet a smoky friendliness of home ,</l>
      <l n="1482">And a foreknowing care for mighty trifles .</l>
      <l n="1483">“ There are miles and miles for you to wander in , ”</l>
      <l n="1484">She told him once : “ Your prison yard is large ,</l>
      <l n="1485">And I would rather take my two ears off</l>
      <l n="1486">And feed them to the fishes in the fountain</l>
      <l n="1487">Than buzz like an incorrigible bee</l>
      <l n="1488">For always around yours , and have you hate</l>
      <l n="1489">The sound of me ; for some day then , for certain ,</l>
      <l n="1490">Your philosophic rage would see in me</l>
      <l n="1491">A bee in earnest , and your hand would smite</l>
      <l n="1492">My life away . And what would you do then ?</l>
      <l n="1493">I know : for years and years you 'd sit alone</l>
      <l n="1494">Upon my grave , and be the grieving image</l>
      <l n="1495">Of lean remorse , and suffer miserably ;</l>
      <l n="1496">And often , all day long , you 'd only shake</l>
      <l n="1497">Your celebrated head and all it holds ,</l>
      <l n="1498">Or beat it with your fist the while you groaned</l>
      <l n="1499">Aloud and went on saying to yourself :</l>
      <l n="1500">‘ Never should I have killed her , or believed</l>
      <l n="1501">She was a bee that buzzed herself to death ,</l>
      <l n="1502">First having made me crazy , had there been</l>
      <l n="1503">Judicious distance and wise absences</l>
      <l n="1504">To keep the two of us inquisitive . ’ ” —</l>
      <l n="1505">“ I fear you bow your unoffending head</l>
      <l n="1506">Before a load that should be mine , ” said he ;</l>
      <l n="1507">“ If so , you led me on by listening .</l>
      <l n="1508">You should have shrieked and jumped , and then fled yelling ;</l>
      <l n="1509">That 's the best way when a man talks too long .</l>
      <l n="1510">God 's pity on me if I love your feet</l>
      <l n="1511">More now than I could ever love the face</l>
      <l n="1512">Of any one of all those Vivians</l>
      <l n="1513">You summoned out of nothing on the night</l>
      <l n="1514">When I saw towers . I 'll wander and amend . ” —</l>
      <l n="1515">At that she flung the noose of her soft arms</l>
      <l n="1516">Around his neck and kissed him instantly :</l>
      <l n="1517">“ You are the wisest man that ever was ,</l>
      <l n="1518">And I 've a prayer to make : May all you say</l>
      <l n="1519">To Vivian be a part of what you knew</l>
      <l n="1520">Before the curse of her unquiet head</l>
      <l n="1521">Was on your shoulder , as you have it now ,</l>
      <l n="1522">To punish you for knowing beyond knowledge .</l>
      <l n="1523">You are the only one who sees enough</l>

      <l n="1529">When I say now to you that I 'm alone .</l>
      <l n="1530">Like you , I saw too much ; and unlike you</l>
      <l n="1531">I made no kingdom out of what I saw —</l>
      <l n="1532">Or none save this one here that you must rule ,</l>
      <l n="1533">Believing you are ruled . I see too far</l>
      <l n="1534">To rule myself . Time 's way with you and me</l>

      <l n="1536">And out of tune with Time . We have this place ,</l>
      <l n="1537">And you must hold us in it or we die .</l>
      <l n="1538">Look at me now and say if what I say</l>
      <l n="1539">Be folly or not ; for my unquiet head</l>
      <l n="1540">Is no conceit of mine . I had it first</l>
      <l n="1541">When I was born ; and I shall have it with me</l>
      <l n="1542">Till my unquiet soul is on its way</l>
      <l n="1543">To be , I hope , where souls are quieter .</l>
      <l n="1544">So let the first and last activity</l>
      <l n="1545">Of what you say so often is your love</l>
      <l n="1546">Be always to remember that our lyres</l>
      <l n="1547">Are not strung for Today . On you it falls</l>
      <l n="1548">To keep them in accord here with each other ,</l>

      <l n="1550">For distant things — and you . And you are Merlin .</l>
      <l n="1551">Poor wizard ! Vivian is your punishment</l>
      <l n="1552">For making kings of men who are not kings ;</l>
      <l n="1553">And you are mine , by the same reasoning ,</l>

      <l n="1555">With anything but you . No other man</l>

      <l n="2526">That she was warm and kind , and over-wise</l>
      <l n="2527">For woman in a world where men see not</l>
      <l n="2528">Beyond themselves . She saw beyond them all ,</l>
      <l n="2529">As I did ; and she waited , as I did ,</l>
      <l n="2530">The coming of a day when cherry-blossoms</l>
      <l n="2531">Were to fall down all over me like snow</l>
      <l n="2532">In springtime . I was far from Camelot</l>
      <l n="2533">That afternoon ; and I am farther now</l>
      <l n="2534">From her . I see no more for me to do</l>

      <l n="2544">Nor caring that she knows . In time to be ,</l>

      <l n="2547">Not shining only to consume itself</l>
      <l n="2548">With what it burns . She knows not yet the name</l>
      <l n="2549">Of what she is , for now there is no name ;</l>
      <l n="2550">Some day there shall be . Time has many names ,</l>
      <l n="2551">Unwritten yet , for what we say is old</l>
      <l n="2552">Because we are so young that it seems old .</l>
      <l n="2553">And this is all a part of what I saw</l>
      <l n="2554">Before you saw King Arthur . When we parted ,</l>
      <l n="2555">I told her I should see the King again ,</l>
      <l n="2556">And , having seen him , might go back again</l>
      <l n="2557">To see her face once more . But I shall see</l>
      <l n="2558">No more the lady Vivian . Let her love</l>
      <l n="2559">What man she may , no other love than mine</l>
      <l n="2560">Shall be an index of her memories .</l>
      <l n="2561">I fear no man who may come after me ,</l>
      <l n="2562">And I see none . I see her , still in green ,</l>

      <l n="2568">And say : ‘ I knew him when his heart was young ,</l>

      <l n="2624">And through the dark that lay beyond myself</l>
      <l n="2625">I saw two fires that are to light the world . ”</l>
      <l n="2626">On Dagonet the silent hand of Merlin</l>
      <l n="2627">Weighed now as living iron that held him down</l>
      <l n="2628">With a primeval power . Doubt , wonderment ,</l>
      <l n="2629">Impatience , and a self-accusing sorrow</l>
      <l n="2630">Born of an ancient love , possessed and held him</l>

      <l n="2637">I know a tavern that will take us in ;</l>

      <l n="2640">“ Well , Dagonet , the King is listening . ” —</l>
      <l n="2641">And Dagonet answered , hearing in the words</l>

      <l n="2643">Of graver pity , “ I shall die a fool . ”</l>
      <l n="2644">He heard what might have been a father 's laugh ,</l>
      <l n="2645">Faintly behind him ; and the living weight</l>
      <l n="2646">Of Merlin 's hand was lifted . They arose ,</l>
      <l n="2647">And , saying nothing , found a groping way</l>
      <l n="2648">Down through the gloom together . Fiercer now ,</l>
      <l n="2649">The wind was like a flying animal</l>
      <l n="2650">That beat the two of them incessantly</l>
      <l n="2651">With icy wings , and bit them as they went .</l>
      <l n="2652">The rock above them was an empty place</l>
      <l n="2653">Where neither seer nor fool should view again</l>
      <l n="2654">The stricken city . Colder blew the wind</l>

   <p>Edwin Arlington Robinson 's comedy “ Van Zorn ” proved him to be one of the most accomplished of the younger generation of American dramatists . Of this play the Boston Transcript said “ It is an effective presentation of modern life in New York City , in which a poet shows his skill of playwriting ... he brings to the American drama to-day a thing it sadly lacks , and that is character . ” In manner and technique Mr. Robinson 's new play “ The Porcupine ” recalls some of the work of Ibsen . Written adroitly and with the literary cleverness exhibited in “ Van Zorn ” it tells a story of a domestic entanglement in a dramatic fashion well calculated to hold the reader 's attention .</p>
   <p>“ He writes admirable dialogue , and his characters have strong and consistent individuality . Moreover , he has freshness of invention , and knows how to unfold an interesting story in dramatic form . ” — Nation .</p>
