    <head>THE HOUSE OF NIGHT</head>
     <l n="1">Though all the light were lifted from the land ,</l>
     <l n="2">And a great darkness lay upon the sea ;</l>
     <l n="3">Though , groping each for some not-careless hand ,</l>
     <l n="4">I felt sad men pass over wearily ;</l>
     <l n="5">Though it were certain dawn would not come in</l>
     <l n="6">With the next hour ; that after many days</l>
     <l n="7">Would no moon rise where the grey clouds grew thin ,</l>
     <l n="8">Nor any stars resume their ancient ways :</l>
     <l n="9">Though all my world was thus , and I more blind</l>
     <l n="10">Than the dead , blundering planets raining past ,</l>
     <l n="11">I know I should not fancy Time unkind ;</l>
     <l n="12">For you , as once of old you came , at last</l>
     <l n="13">Would surely come , and with unfaltering faith</l>
     <l n="14">Lead me beyond the dominance of death .</l>
   </lg>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>THE HOUSE OF DOUBT</head>
     <l n="1">Why should we fear ? The sun will surely rise ,</l>
     <l n="2">If we but wait , to light us on our way .</l>
     <l n="3">Think you none hearkeneth to us who pray ,</l>
     <l n="4">That no God 's heart is softened by our cries ?</l>
     <l n="5">Did we not learn that He was kind and wise</l>
     <l n="6">And loved our souls ? And shall your bodies say</l>
     <l n="7">“ There is no light . The tales they told us ,— they</l>
     <l n="8">Were only dreams , dreamed in the House of Lies . ”</l>
     <l n="9">Nay , listen not to what your body saith ,</l>
     <l n="10">But by the memory of those antique years</l>
     <l n="11">When it was evil and of little faith</l>
     <l n="12">And led the soul along a way of tears ,</l>
     <l n="13">Let your soul chant — as one that hath no fears —</l>
     <l n="14">“ We know that Thou art stronger , God , than death . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>THE HOUSE OF MERCY</head>
     <l n="1">I question not , Beloved , nor deny</l>
     <l n="2">That you had God 's own right of punishment ;</l>
     <l n="3">Yet now my sins and days are over and spent</l>
     <l n="4">Find you the hours so pleasant that go by ?</l>
     <l n="5">Would not the colour of the fields and sky ,</l>
     <l n="6">The odour of the woods , bring more content</l>
     <l n="7">Now , if a little pity had been lent</l>
     <l n="8">Then , unto love , to judge a life awry ?</l>
     <l n="9">Upon a day the young June grasses seem</l>
     <l n="10">Quite still that keep the edge of the still stream ;</l>
     <l n="11">I think you go down close to them , and say :</l>
     <l n="12">“ O little grasses , waiting patiently ,</l>
     <l n="13">I come to tell you this is God 's decree :</l>
     <l n="14">‘ I comfort him who suffered yesterday ? ’ ”</l>
   </lg>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>THE HOUSE OF EARTH</head>
     <l n="1">O ye disconsolate and heavy-souled ,</l>
     <l n="2">That evening cometh when ye too shall learn</l>
     <l n="3">The pangs of one who may no more return ,</l>
     <l n="4">To live again the uneven days of old .</l>
     <l n="5">Ye too shall weary of the myrrh and gold</l>
     <l n="6">( Seeing the gods and their great unconcern ) ,</l>
     <l n="7">And , as I yearn to-day , your feet shall yearn</l>
     <l n="8">To touch that Earth which ye afar behold .</l>
     <l n="9">Think now upon your grievous things to bear ,—</l>
     <l n="10">Some goal unwon , some old sin 's lurid stain ,</l>
     <l n="11">Your vistaed paths ,— are they not fair as hope ?</l>
     <l n="12">But I between dead suns must peer , and grope</l>
     <l n="13">Among forsaken worlds , one glimpse to gain</l>
     <l n="14">Of my old place — the heaviest shadow there .</l>
   </lg>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>THE HOUSE OF FAITH</head>
     <l n="1">I would not have thee , dear , in darkness sit ,</l>
     <l n="2">On days like this , hand clasped in quiet hand ,</l>
     <l n="3">Remembering mournfully that fragrant land —</l>
     <l n="4">Each day therein , the joy we had of it .</l>
     <l n="5">Rather , while still the lamps are trimmed and lit ,</l>
     <l n="6">Bid strangers to the feasts that once we planned ,</l>
     <l n="7">Merry the while ! Until the dust 's demand</l>
     <l n="8">My soul , not thine , shall separately submit .</l>
     <l n="9">So , when thou comest ( for I at last will call</l>
     <l n="10">And thou shalt hear , and linger not at all ) ,</l>
     <l n="11">Still to thy throat , thine arms , thy loosened hair</l>
     <l n="12">Will cling the savour of the World 's fresh kiss ,</l>
     <l n="13">So sweet to me ! and doubly sweet for this —</l>
     <l n="14">That thou for mine shouldst leave a place so fair !</l>
   </lg>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>THE HOUSE OF TEARS</head>
     <l n="1">When in the old years I had dreams of thee</l>
     <l n="2">Thy dark walls stood in a most barren place ;</l>
     <l n="3">And he within ( was his wan face my face ? )</l>
     <l n="4">Wandered alone and wept continually .</l>
     <l n="5">There was no bird to hear , nor sun to see ,</l>
     <l n="6">Nor green thing growing ; nor for his release</l>
     <l n="7">Came sleep ; neither forgetfulness nor peace :</l>
     <l n="8">Whereby I knew that none had sinned as he .</l>
     <l n="9">To-day I met him where white lilies gleam ;</l>
     <l n="10">Across our path we watched the sparrows flit ;</l>
     <l n="11">Until — the sunlight strong in our dry eyes —</l>
     <l n="12">He paused with me beside a green-edged stream ,</l>
     <l n="13">Moaning , “ I know , where its young waters rise ,</l>
     <l n="14">Remembering , one leaneth over it . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>THE HOUSE OF LOVE</head>
     <l n="1">Often between the midnight and the morn</l>
     <l n="2">I wake and see the angels round my bed ;</l>
     <l n="3">Then fall asleep again , well-comforted .</l>
     <l n="4">I wait not now till that clear dawn be born</l>
     <l n="5">Shall lead my feet ( O Love , thine eyes are worn</l>
     <l n="6">With watching ) where her feet have late been led ;</l>
     <l n="7">Nor lie awake , saying the words she said —</l>
     <l n="8">( Her yellow hair .— Have ye seen yellow corn ? )</l>
     <l n="9">I fall asleep and dream and quite forget ,</l>
     <l n="10">For here in heaven I know a new love 's birth</l>
     <l n="11">Which casteth out all memory . And yet</l>
     <l n="12">( As I had loved her more , O Christ , on earth ,</l>
     <l n="13">Hadst Thou not been so long unsought , unmet )</l>
     <l n="14">Some morrow Thou shalt learn my worship 's worth .</l>
   </lg>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>THE HOUSE OF BEAUTY</head>
     <l n="1">She pauseth ; and as each great mirror swings</l>
     <l n="2">( O ruined Helen , O once golden hair )</l>
     <l n="3">I see OEnone 's ashes scattered there .</l>
     <l n="4">Another , and , behold , the shadowed things</l>
     <l n="5">Are violated tombs of shrunken kings .</l>
     <l n="6">And yet another ( O , how thou wert fair ! ) ,</l>
     <l n="7">And I see one , black-clad , who prayeth where</l>
     <l n="8">No sound of sword on cloven helmet rings .</l>
     <l n="9">Yet , were I Paris , once more should I see</l>
     <l n="10">Troy 's seaward gates for us swung open wide .</l>
     <l n="11">Or old Nile 's glory , were I Anthony .</l>
     <l n="12">Or , were I Launcelot , the garden-side</l>
     <l n="13">At Joyous Gard . Surely ; for even to me ,</l>
     <l n="14">Where Love hath lived hath Beauty never died .</l>
   </lg>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>THE HOUSE OF CONTENT</head>
     <l n="1">Were once again the immortal moment mine</l>
     <l n="2">How should I choose my path ? The path I chose</l>
     <l n="3">( How long ago I wonder if Time knows )</l>
     <l n="4">Even now I see . I see the old sun shine</l>
     <l n="5">Upon the moss , thick strewn with fir and pine ;</l>
     <l n="6">The open field ; the orchard 's even rows ;</l>
     <l n="7">The wood again ; then , where the hills unclose ,</l>
     <l n="8">Far off at first , now near , the long-sought shrine .</l>
     <l n="9">O Time , how impotent thou art ! Though thou</l>
     <l n="10">Hast taken me from all things , and all things</l>
     <l n="11">From me ,— although the wind of thy swift wings</l>
     <l n="12">Hath swept at last the shadow from her brow</l>
     <l n="13">Of my last kiss , yet do I triumph now</l>
     <l n="14">Who , choosing , paused to hear Love 's counsellings .</l>
   </lg>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>THE HOUSE OF CHANGE</head>
     <l n="1">Was it last Autumn only , when I stood</l>
     <l n="2">At the field 's edge , and watched the red glow creep</l>
     <l n="3">Among the leaves , and saw the swift flame sweep</l>
     <l n="4">From spruce to hemlock , till the living wood</l>
     <l n="5">Became a devastated solitude ?</l>
     <l n="6">For now , behold , old seeds , long years asleep ,</l>
     <l n="7">Wake ; and a legion of young birches leap</l>
     <l n="8">To life , and tell the ashes life is good .</l>
     <l n="9">O Love of long ago , when this mad fire</l>
     <l n="10">Is over , and the ruins of my soul</l>
     <l n="11">With the Spring wind the old quest would resume ,—</l>
     <l n="12">When age knocks at the inn of youth 's desire ,</l>
     <l n="13">Shall the new growth , now worthier of the goal ,</l>
     <l n="14">Find still untenanted the chosen room ?</l>
   </lg>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>THE HOUSE OF REGRET</head>
     <l n="1">It is not that I now were happier</l>
     <l n="2">If with the dawn my tireless feet were led</l>
     <l n="3">Along her path , till I saw her fair head</l>
     <l n="4">Thrown back to make the sunshine goldener :</l>
     <l n="5">For it is well , sometimes , the things that were</l>
     <l n="6">Are over , ere their perfectness hath fled ;</l>
     <l n="7">Lest the old love of them should fade instead ,</l>
     <l n="8">And lie like ruins round the throne of her .</l>
     <l n="9">Now with the wisdom of increasing years</l>
     <l n="10">I know each ancient joy a cup for tears ;</l>
     <l n="11">Yet had I drunk , while they were draughts to praise ,</l>
     <l n="12">Deeper , I were not now as men that grow</l>
     <l n="13">Old , and sit gazing out across the snow</l>
     <l n="14">To dream sad dreams of wasted summer days .</l>
   </lg>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>THE HOUSE OF WISDOM</head>
     <l n="1">I had not thought ( ah , God ! had I but known ! )</l>
     <l n="2">That this sad hour should ever me befall ,</l>
     <l n="3">When thou I judged the holiest of all</l>
     <l n="4">Should come to be the thing I must disown .</l>
     <l n="5">Was it not true ? that April morn ? thy blown</l>
     <l n="6">Gold hair around my hair for coronal ?</l>
     <l n="7">Or is this truer ?— thou at the outer wall ,</l>
     <l n="8">Unroyal , and with unrepentant moan ?</l>
     <l n="9">Yet prize I now this wisdom I have won ,</l>
     <l n="10">Who must always remember ? Nay ! My tears</l>
     <l n="11">Must close mine eyes — as thou wouldst hide thy face</l>
     <l n="12">If some great meteor , kindred to the sun ,</l>
     <l n="13">Should haunt the undying stars ten million years</l>
     <l n="14">To fall , some noon , dead in thy market place .</l>
   </lg>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>THE HOUSE OF SIN</head>
     <l n="1">When Time is done at last , and the last Spring</l>
     <l n="2">Fadeth on earth , and thy gaze seeketh mine ,</l>
     <l n="3">Watch well for one whose face beareth for sign</l>
     <l n="4">The legend of a soul 's refashioning :</l>
     <l n="5">As I shall watch for one whose pale hands bring</l>
     <l n="6">The first faint violet , and know them thine</l>
     <l n="7">Grown pitiful and come to build Love 's shrine</l>
     <l n="8">Where the old Aprils wait , unfaltering .</l>
     <l n="9">Then the great floods between us will retire ,</l>
     <l n="10">And the long path I follow down will grow</l>
     <l n="11">To be the path thy climbing feet desire ;</l>
     <l n="12">Until we meet at last , made glad , and know</l>
     <l n="13">The cleansing hands that made my soul as snow</l>
     <l n="14">Have kept alive in thine the ancient fire .</l>
   </lg>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>THE HOUSE OF MUSIC</head>
     <l n="1">Such space there is , such endless breadth of time</l>
     <l n="2">Between me and my world of yesterday ,</l>
     <l n="3">I half forget what sounds these be that stray</l>
     <l n="4">About my chamber , and grow and fall and climb .</l>
     <l n="5">Listen !— that sweet reiterated chime ,</l>
     <l n="6">Doth it not mark some body changed to clay ?</l>
     <l n="7">That last great chord , some anguish far away ?</l>
     <l n="8">Hark ! harmony ever now and faultless rhyme .</l>
     <l n="9">O Soul of mine , among these lutes and lyres ,</l>
     <l n="10">These reeds , these golden pipes , and quivering strings ,</l>
     <l n="11">Thou knowest now that in the old , old years</l>
     <l n="12">We who knew only one of all desires</l>
     <l n="13">Came often even to music 's furthest springs —</l>
     <l n="14">To pass , because their waters gleamed like tears .</l>
   </lg>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>THE HOUSE OF COLOUR</head>
     <l n="1">Mine gold is here ; yea , heavy yellow gold ,</l>
     <l n="2">Gathered ere Earth 's first days and nights were fled ;</l>
     <l n="3">And all the walls are hung with scarfs of red ,</l>
     <l n="4">Broidered in fallen cities , fold on fold ;</l>
     <l n="5">The stained window 's saints are aureoled ;</l>
     <l n="6">And all the textures of the East are spread</l>
     <l n="7">On the paved floor , whereon I lay my head ,</l>
     <l n="8">And sleep , and count the coloured things of old .</l>
     <l n="9">Once , when the hills and I were all aflame</l>
     <l n="10">With envy of the pageant in the West</l>
     <l n="11">( Except the sombre pine-trees — whence there came ,</l>
     <l n="12">Continually , the sigh of their unrest ) ,</l>
     <l n="13">A lonely crow sailed past me , black as shame ,</l>
     <l n="14">Hugging some ancient sorrow to his breast .</l>
   </lg>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>THE FOURTH DAY</head>
     <l n="1">As when the tideless , barren waters lay</l>
     <l n="2">About the borders of the early earth ;</l>
     <l n="3">And small , unopened buds dreamt not the worth</l>
     <l n="4">Of their incomparable gold array ;</l>
     <l n="5">And tall young hemlocks were not set a-sway</l>
     <l n="6">By any wind ; and orchards knew no mirth</l>
     <l n="7">At Autumn time , nor plenteousness from dearth ;</l>
     <l n="8">And night and morning , then , were the first day ,</l>
     <l n="9">— Even so was I . Yet , as I slept last night ,</l>
     <l n="10">My soul surged towards thy love 's controlling power ;</l>
     <l n="11">And , quickened now with the sun 's splendid might ,</l>
     <l n="12">Breaks into unimaginable flower ,</l>
     <l n="13">Knowing thy soul knows this for beacon-light —</l>
     <l n="14">The culmination of the harvest hour .</l>
   </lg>

    <head>VICTORY</head>
     <l n="1">Because your strife and labour have been vain ,</l>
     <l n="2">Ye who have striven , shall I forego , forget</l>
     <l n="3">The far-off goal where to my feet were set</l>
     <l n="4">In the old days when life was first made plain ?</l>
     <l n="5">Upward in April , who , meeting with the rain ,</l>
     <l n="6">Did turn , the first shy mayflowers still are met ?</l>
     <l n="7">I who have sought , yea , who am seeking yet ,</l>
     <l n="8">What pain have I like unto your sore pain ?</l>
     <l n="9">So let me go as one yearning , that braves ,</l>
     <l n="10">With shipmen that have knowledge of the sea ,</l>
     <l n="11">The wind disastrous and the ponderous waves</l>
     <l n="12">( Because his love dwells in some far countree ) ,</l>
     <l n="13">Crying , “ Not one of all your million graves</l>
     <l n="14">Is deep enough to keep my love from me ! ”</l>

    <head>THE LAST STORM</head>
     <l n="1">From north , from east , the strong wind hurries down</l>
     <l n="2">Against the window-pane the sleet rings fast ;</l>
     <l n="3">The moon hath hid her face away , aghast ,</l>
     <l n="4">And darkness keeps each corner of the town .</l>
     <l n="5">The garden hedges wear a heavy crown ,</l>
     <l n="6">And the old poplars shriek , as night drifts past ,</l>
     <l n="7">That , leagues on desolate leagues away , at last</l>
     <l n="8">One comes to know he too must surely drown .</l>
     <l n="9">And yet at noon , to-morrow , when I go</l>
     <l n="10">Out to the white , white edges of the plain ,</l>
     <l n="11">I shall not grieve for this night 's hurricane ,</l>
     <l n="12">Seeing how , in a little hollow , sinks the snow</l>
     <l n="13">Around the southmost tree , where a lean crow</l>
     <l n="14">Sits noisily impatient for the rain .</l>

   <lg type="poem">
    <head>A LAST WORD</head>
     <l n="1">And if it be I shall not sing again ,</l>
     <l n="2">And thou have wonder at my silent ways ,</l>
     <l n="3">I pray thee think my days not weary days ,</l>
     <l n="4">Or that my heart is dumb for some new pain .</l>
     <l n="5">Seeing that words are nought , nor may remain ,</l>
     <l n="6">Why should I strive with Time ? Come blame , come praise ,</l>
     <l n="7">I am but one of them his might betrays</l>
     <l n="8">At last , when all men learn that all was vain .</l>
     <l n="9">And yet one thing Time cannot wrest from me .</l>
     <l n="10">Therefore , cry out , yea , even to the throng</l>
     <l n="11">That pauseth not for echo of a song ,</l>
     <l n="12">“ O , your red gold is very fair . But he</l>
     <l n="13">Is glad as heaven to loiter and dream along</l>
     <l n="14">His Lady Beauty 's path continually . ”</l>
