    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="20">Gentle Reader , who so patiently have waited</l>
     <l n="21">For such viands as your poet can provide ,</l>
     <l n="22">( Which , as critics have occasionally stated ,</l>
     <l n="23">Must be trying to a delicate inside ,)</l>
     <l n="24">Once again are opportunities afforded</l>
     <l n="25">Of a banquet , or a dejeuner at least ,</l>
     <l n="26">Once again your toleration is rewarded</l>
     <l n="27">By a literary feast !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="28">You may think that Rudyard Kipling 's work is stronger ,</l>
     <l n="29">Or that Chaucer 's may be rather more mature ;</l>
     <l n="30">Byron 's lyrics are indubitably longer ,</l>
     <l n="31">Robert Browning 's just a trifle more obscure ;</l>
     <l n="32">But ‘ tis certain that no poems are politer ,</l>
     <l n="33">Or more fitted for perusal in the home ,</l>
     <l n="34">Than the verses of the unassuming writer</l>
     <l n="35">Of this memorable tome !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="36">Austin Dobson is a daintier performer ,</l>
     <l n="37">Andrew Lang is far more scholarly and wise ,</l>
     <l n="38">Mr. Swinburne can , of course , be somewhat warmer ,</l>
     <l n="39">Alfred Austin more amusing , if he tries ;</l>
     <l n="40">But there 's no one in the world ( and well you know it ! )</l>
     <l n="41">Who can emulate the bard of whom we speak ,</l>
     <l n="42">For the literary methods of our poet</l>
     <l n="43">Are admittedly unique !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="44">Tho ’ he shows no sort of penitence at breaking</l>
     <l n="45">Ev'ry rule of English grammar and of style ,</l>
     <l n="46">( Not a rhyme is too atrocious for his making ,</l>
     <l n="47">Not a metre for his purpose is too vile ! )</l>
     <l n="48">Tho ’ his treatment is essentially destructive ,</l>
     <l n="49">And his taste a thing that no one can admire ,</l>
     <l n="50">There is something incontestably seductive</l>
     <l n="51">In the music of his lyre !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="52">Gentle Reader , some apologies are needed</l>
     <l n="53">For depositing this volume on your desk ,</l>
     <l n="54">Since the author has undoubtedly exceeded</l>
     <l n="55">All the limits of legitimate burlesque ,</l>
     <l n="56">And we look with very genuine affection</l>
     <l n="57">To a Public who , for better or for worse ,</l>
     <l n="58">Will relieve us of this villainous collection</l>
     <l n="59">Of abominable verse !</l>

   <p>Eve</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">I always love to picture Eve ,</l>
     <l n="2">Whatever captious critics say ,</l>
     <l n="3">As one who was , as I believe ,</l>
     <l n="4">The nicest woman of her day ;</l>
     <l n="5">Attractive to the outward view ,</l>
     <l n="6">And such a perfect lady too !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="7">Unselfish ,— that one can n't dispute ,</l>
     <l n="8">Recalling her intense delight ,</l>
     <l n="9">When she acquired some novel fruit ,</l>
     <l n="10">In giving all her friends a bite ;</l>
     <l n="11">Her very troubles she would share</l>
     <l n="12">With those who happened to be there .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="13">Her wardrobe , though extremely small ,</l>
     <l n="14">Sufficed a somewhat simple need ;</l>
     <l n="15">She was , if anything at all ,</l>
     <l n="16">A trifle underdressed , indeed ,</l>
     <l n="17">And never visited a play</l>
     <l n="18">In headgear known as “ matinee . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="19">Possessing but a single beau ,</l>
     <l n="20">With only one affaire de c [ oe ] ur ,</l>
     <l n="21">She promptly married , as we know ,</l>
     <l n="22">The man who first proposed to her ;</l>
     <l n="23">Not for his title or his pelf ,</l>
     <l n="24">But simply for his own sweet self .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="25">He loved her madly , at first sight ;</l>
     <l n="26">His callow heart was quite upset ;</l>
     <l n="27">He thought her nearly , if not quite ,</l>
     <l n="28">The sweetest soul he 'd ever met ;</l>
     <l n="29">She found him charming — for a man ,</l>
     <l n="30">And so their young romance began .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="31">Their wedding was a trifle tame —</l>
     <l n="32">A purely family affair —</l>
     <l n="33">No guests were asked , no pressmen came</l>
     <l n="34">To interview the happy pair ;</l>
     <l n="35">No crowds of curious strangers bored them ,</l>
     <l n="36">The “ Eden Journal ” quite ignored them .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="37">They had the failings of their class ,</l>
     <l n="38">The faults and foibles of the youthful ;</l>
     <l n="39">She was inquisitive , alas !</l>
     <l n="40">And he was — not exactly truthful ;</l>
     <l n="41">But never was there man or woman</l>
     <l n="42">So truly , so intensely human !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="43">And , hand in hand , from day to day ,</l>
     <l n="44">They lived and labored , man and wife ;</l>
     <l n="45">Together hewed their common way</l>
     <l n="46">Along the rugged path of Life ;</l>
     <l n="47">Remaining , though the seasons pass 'd ,</l>
     <l n="48">Friends , lovers , to the very last .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="49">So , side by side , they shared , these two ,</l>
     <l n="50">The sorrow and the joys of living ;</l>
     <l n="51">The Man , devoted , tender , true ,</l>
     <l n="52">The Woman , patient and forgiving ;</l>
     <l n="53">Their common toil , their common weather ,</l>
     <l n="54">But drew them closelier still together .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="55">And if they ever chanced to grieve ,</l>
     <l n="56">Enduring loss , or suff'ring pain ,</l>
     <l n="57">You may be certain it was Eve</l>
     <l n="58">Brought comfort to their hearts again ;</l>
     <l n="59">If they were happy , well I know ,</l>
     <l n="60">It was the Woman made them so .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="61">And though the anthropologist</l>
     <l n="62">May mention , in his tactless way ,</l>
     <l n="63">That Adam 's weaknesses exist</l>
     <l n="64">Among our modern Men to-day ,</l>
     <l n="65">In Women we may still perceive</l>
     <l n="66">The virtues of their Mother Eve !</l>
    </lg>

   <p>Lady Godiva</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">In the old town of Coventry , so people say ,</l>
     <l n="2">Dwelt a Peer who was utterly lacking in pity ;</l>
     <l n="3">Universally loathed for the rigorous way</l>
     <l n="4">That he burdened the rates of the City .</l>
     <l n="5">By his merciless methods of petty taxation ,</l>
     <l n="6">The poor were reduced to the verge of starvation .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="7">But the Earl had a wife , whom the people adored ,</l>
     <l n="8">For her kindness of heart even more than her beauty ,</l>
     <l n="9">And her pitiless lord she besought and implored</l>
     <l n="10">To remit this extortionate “ duty ” ;</l>
     <l n="11">But he answered : “ My dear , pray reflect at your leisure ,</l>
     <l n="12">What you deem a ‘ duty , ’ to me is a pleasure ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="13">At the heart of her spouse she continued to storm ,</l>
     <l n="14">And she closed her entreaties , one day , by exclaiming :—</l>
     <l n="15">“ If you take off the tax , I will gladly perform</l>
     <l n="16">Any task that you like to be naming ! ”</l>
     <l n="17">“ Well , if that be the case , ” said the nobleman , “ I 've a</l>
     <l n="18">Good mind just to test you , my Lady Godiva !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="19">“ To your wishes , my dear , I will straight acquiesce ,</l>
     <l n="20">On the single condition — I give you fair warning —</l>
     <l n="21">That you ride through the City , at noon , in the dress</l>
     <l n="22">That you wear in your bath of a morning ! ”</l>
     <l n="23">“ Very well ! ” she replied . “ Be it so ! Though you drive a</l>
     <l n="24">Hard bargain , my lord , ” said the Lady Godiva .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="25">So she slipped off her gown , and her shoulders lay bare ,</l>
     <l n="26">Gleaming white like the moon on Aonian fountains ;</l>
     <l n="27">When about them she loosened her curtain of hair ,</l>
     <l n="28">‘ Twas like Night coming over the mountains !</l>
     <l n="29">And she blushed , ‘ neath the veil of her wonderful tresses ,</l>
     <l n="30">As blushes the Morn ‘ neath the Sun 's first caresses !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="31">Then she went to the stable and saddled her steed ,</l>
     <l n="32">Who erected his ears , till he looked like a rabbit ,</l>
     <l n="33">He was somewhat surprised , as he might be , indeed ,</l>
     <l n="34">At the lady 's unusual “ habit ” ;</l>
     <l n="35">But allowed her to mount in the masculine way ,</l>
     <l n="36">For he could n't say “ No , ” and he would n't say “ Neigh ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="37">So she rode through the town , in the heat of the sun ,</l>
     <l n="38">For the weather was ( luckily ) warm as the Tropics ,</l>
     <l n="39">And the people all drew down their blinds — except one ,</l>
     <l n="40">On the staff of the local “ Town Topics . ”</l>
     <l n="41">( Such misconduct produced in the eyes of this vile one</l>
     <l n="42">A cataract nearly as large as the Nile one ! )</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="43">Then Godiva returned , and the Earl had to yield ,</l>
     <l n="44">( And the paralyzed pressman dictated his cable ;)</l>
     <l n="45">The tax was remitted , the bells were repealed ,</l>
     <l n="46">And the horse was returned to the stable ;</l>
     <l n="47">While banners were waved from each possible quarter ,</l>
     <l n="48">Except from the flat of the stricken reporter .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="49">Now the Moral is this — if I 've fathomed the tale</l>
     <l n="50">( Though it needs a more delicate pen to explain it ):—</l>
     <l n="51">You can get whatsoever you want , without fail ,</l>
     <l n="52">If you 'll sacrifice all to obtain it .</l>
     <l n="53">You should try to avoid unconventional capers ,</l>
     <l n="54">And be sure you do n't write for Society papers .</l>

     <l n="1">A very Woman among Men !</l>
     <l n="2">Her paeans , sung in ev'ry quarter ,</l>
     <l n="3">Almost persuade Le Gallienne</l>
     <l n="4">To go and get his hair cut shorter ;</l>
     <l n="5">When Kipling hears her trumpet-note</l>
     <l n="6">He longs to don a petticoat .</l>

     <l n="7">Her praise is sung by old or young ,</l>
     <l n="8">From Happy Hampstead to Hoboken ,</l>
     <l n="9">Where'er old England 's mother-tongue</l>
     <l n="10">Is ( ungrammatically ) spoken :</l>
     <l n="11">In that supremely simple set</l>
     <l n="12">Which loves the penny novelette .</l>

     <l n="13">When Anglo-Saxon peoples kneel</l>
