     <item>ELLA WHEELER WILCOX . April 12th , 1910 .</item>
     <item>I step across the mystic border-land , And look upon the wonder-world of Art . How beautiful , how beautiful its hills ! And all its valleys , how surpassing fair !</item>
     <item>The winding paths that lead up to the heights Are polished by the footsteps of the great . The mountain-peaks stand very near to God : The chosen few whose feet have trod thereon Have talked with Him , and with the angels walked .</item>
     <item>Here are no sounds of discord — no profane Or senseless gossip of unworthy things -  Only the songs of chisels and of pens , Of busy brushes , and ecstatic strains Of souls surcharged with music most divine . Here is no idle sorrow , no poor grief For any day or object left behind -  For time is counted precious , and herein Is such complete abandonment of Self That tears turn into rainbows , and enhance The beauty of the land where all is fair . Awed and afraid , I cross the border-land . Oh , who am I , that I dare enter here Where the great artists of the world have trod -  The genius-crowned aristocrats of Earth ? Only the singer of a little song ; Yet loving Art with such a mighty love I hold it greater to have won a place Just on the fair land 's edge , to make my grave , Than in the outer world of greed and gain To sit upon a royal throne and reign .</item>

     <lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="2">It is easy enough to be pleasant</l>
       <l n="3">When life flows by like a song ,</l>
       <l n="4">But the man worth while is the one who will smile</l>
       <l n="5">When everything goes dead wrong .</l>
       <l n="6">For the test of the heart is trouble ,</l>
       <l n="7">And it always comes with the years ,</l>
       <l n="8">And the smile that is worth the praises of earth</l>
       <l n="9">Is the smile that shines through tears .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="10">It is easy enough to be prudent</l>
       <l n="11">When nothing tempts you to stray ,</l>
       <l n="12">When without or within no voice of sin</l>
       <l n="13">Is luring your soul away ;</l>
       <l n="14">But it 's only a negative virtue</l>
       <l n="15">Until it is tried by fire ,</l>
       <l n="16">And the life that is worth the honour on earth</l>
       <l n="17">Is the one that resists desire .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="18">By the cynic , the sad , the fallen ,</l>
       <l n="19">Who had no strength for the strife ,</l>
       <l n="20">The world 's highway is cumbered to-day -</l>
       <l n="21">They make up the sum of life ;</l>
       <l n="22">But the virtue that conquers passion ,</l>
       <l n="23">And the sorrow that hides in a smile -</l>
       <l n="24">It is these that are worth the homage on earth ,</l>
       <l n="25">For we find them but once in a while .</l>

      <head>THE HOUSE OF LIFE</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">All wondering , and eager-eyed , within her portico</l>
       <l n="2">I made my plea to Hostess Life , one morning long ago .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="3">“ Pray show me this great house of thine , nor close a single door ;</l>
       <l n="4">But let me wander where I will , and climb from floor to floor !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="5">For many rooms , and curious things , and treasures great and small</l>
       <l n="6">Within your spacious mansion lie , and I would see them all . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="7">Then Hostess Life turned silently , her searching gaze on me ,</l>
       <l n="8">And with no word , she reached her hand , and offered up the key .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="9">It opened first the door of Hope , and long I lingered there ,</l>
       <l n="10">Until I spied the room of Dreams , just higher by a stair .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="11">And then a door whereon the one word “ Happiness ” was writ ;</l>
       <l n="12">But when I tried the little key I could not make it fit .</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>It turned the lock of Pleasure 's room , where first all seemed so bright -  But after I had stayed awhile it somehow lost its light .</p>
     <lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">And wandering down a lonely hall , I came upon a room</l>
       <l n="2">Marked “ Duty , ” and I entered it — to lose myself in gloom .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="3">Along the shadowy halls I groped my weary way about ,</l>
       <l n="4">And found that from dull Duty 's room , a door of Toil led out .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="5">It led out to another door , whereon a crimson stain</l>
       <l n="6">Made sullenly against the dark these words : “ The Room of Pain . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="7">But oh the light , the light , the light , that spilled down from above</l>
       <l n="8">And upward wound , the stairs of Faith , right to the Tower of Love !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="9">And when I came forth from that place , I tried the little key -</l>
       <l n="10">And lo ! the door of Happiness swung open , wide and free .</l>

      <head>A SONG OF LIFE</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">In the rapture of life and of living ,</l>
       <l n="2">I lift up my heart and rejoice ,</l>
       <l n="3">And I thank the great Giver for giving</l>
       <l n="4">The soul of my gladness a voice .</l>
       <l n="5">In the glow of the glorious weather ,</l>
       <l n="6">In the sweet-scented , sensuous air ,</l>
       <l n="7">My burdens seem light as a feather -</l>
       <l n="8">They are nothing to bear .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="9">In the strength and the glory of power ,</l>
       <l n="10">In the pride and the pleasure of wealth</l>
       <l n="11">( For who dares dispute me my dower</l>
       <l n="12">Of talents and youth-time and health ? ) ,</l>
       <l n="13">I can laugh at the world and its sages -</l>
       <l n="14">I am greater than seers who are sad ,</l>
       <l n="15">For he is most wise in all ages</l>
       <l n="16">Who knows how to be glad .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="17">I lift up my eyes to Apollo ,</l>
       <l n="18">The god of the beautiful days ,</l>
       <l n="19">And my spirit soars off like a swallow ,</l>
       <l n="20">And is lost in the light of its rays .</l>
       <l n="21">Are you troubled and sad ? I beseech you</l>
       <l n="22">Come out of the shadows of strife -</l>
       <l n="23">Come out in the sun while I teach you</l>
       <l n="24">The secret of life .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="25">Come out of the world — come above it -</l>
       <l n="26">Up over its crosses and graves ,</l>
       <l n="27">Though the green earth is fair and I love it ,</l>
       <l n="28">We must love it as masters , not slaves .</l>
       <l n="29">Come up where the dust never rises -</l>
       <l n="30">But only the perfume of flowers -</l>
       <l n="31">And your life shall be glad with surprises</l>
       <l n="32">Of beautiful hours .</l>
       <l n="33">Come up where the rare golden wine is</l>
       <l n="34">Apollo distills in my sight ,</l>
       <l n="35">And your life shall be happy as mine is ,</l>
       <l n="36">And as full of delight .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">I do not undertake to say</l>
       <l n="2">That literal answers come from Heaven ,</l>
       <l n="3">But I know this — that when I pray</l>
       <l n="4">A comfort , a support is given</l>
       <l n="5">That helps me rise o'er earthly things</l>

       <l n="10">That “ all things are controlled by laws . ”</l>
       <l n="11">My life has taught me day by day</l>
       <l n="12">That it availeth much to pray .</l>

       <l n="25">Prayer has a sweet , refining grace ,</l>

       <l n="1">In the long run fame finds the deserving man .</l>
       <l n="2">The lucky wight may prosper for a day ,</l>
       <l n="3">But in good time true merit leads the van</l>
       <l n="4">And vain pretence , unnoticed , goes its way .</l>
       <l n="5">There is no Chance , no Destiny , no Fate ,</l>
       <l n="6">But Fortune smiles on those who work and wait ,</l>

       <l n="11">Bring sure reward to tortured soul and brain .</l>
       <l n="12">Unmeaning joys enervate in the end ,</l>

      <head>AS YOU GO THROUGH LIFE</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">Do n't look for the flaws as you go through life ;</l>
       <l n="2">And even when you find them ,</l>
       <l n="3">It is wise and kind to be somewhat blind ,</l>

       <l n="5">For the cloudiest night has a hint of light</l>
       <l n="6">Somewhere in its shadows hiding ;</l>
       <l n="7">It 's better by far to hunt for a star ,</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="9">The current of life runs ever away</l>

       <l n="12">And think to alter its motion .</l>
       <l n="13">Do n't waste a curse on the universe ,</l>

       <l n="15">Do n't butt at the storm with your puny form ,</l>

       <l n="20">And the sooner you know it the better .</l>
       <l n="21">It is folly to fight with the Infinite ,</l>

       <l n="23">The wiser man shapes into God 's plan ,</l>
