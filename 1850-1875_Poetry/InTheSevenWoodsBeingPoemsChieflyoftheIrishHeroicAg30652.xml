     <l n="2">I have heard the pigeons of the Seven Woods</l>
     <l n="3">Make their faint thunder , and the garden bees</l>
     <l n="4">Hum in the lime tree flowers ; and put away</l>
     <l n="5">The unavailing outcries and the old bitterness</l>
     <l n="6">That empty the heart . I have forgot awhile</l>
     <l n="7">Tara uprooted , and new commonness</l>
     <l n="8">Upon the throne and crying about the streets</l>
     <l n="9">And hanging its paper flowers from post to post ,</l>
     <l n="10">Because it is alone of all things happy .</l>
     <l n="11">I am contented for I know that Quiet</l>
     <l n="12">Wanders laughing and eating her wild heart</l>
     <l n="13">Among pigeons and bees , while that Great Archer ,</l>
     <l n="14">Who but awaits His hour to shoot , still hangs</l>
     <l n="15">A cloudy quiver over Parc-na-Lee .</l>

    <head>THE OLD AGE OF QUEEN MAEVE .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Maeve the great queen was pacing to and fro ,</l>
     <l n="2">Between the walls covered with beaten bronze ,</l>
     <l n="3">In her high house at Cruachan ; the long hearth ,</l>
     <l n="4">Flickering with ash and hazel , but half showed</l>
     <l n="5">Where the tired horse-boys lay upon the rushes ,</l>
     <l n="6">Or on the benches underneath the walls ,</l>
     <l n="7">In comfortable sleep ; all living slept</l>
     <l n="8">But that great queen , who more than half the night</l>
     <l n="9">Had paced from door to fire and fire to door .</l>
     <l n="10">Though now in her old age , in her young age</l>
     <l n="11">She had been beautiful in that old way</l>
     <l n="12">That 's all but gone ; for the proud heart is gone</l>
     <l n="13">And the fool heart of the counting-house fears all</l>
     <l n="14">But soft beauty and indolent desire .</l>
     <l n="15">She could have called over the rim of the world</l>
     <l n="16">Whatever woman 's lover had hit her fancy ,</l>
     <l n="17">And yet had been great bodied and great limbed ,</l>
     <l n="18">Fashioned to be the mother of strong children ;</l>
     <l n="19">And she 'd had lucky eyes and a high heart ,</l>
     <l n="20">And wisdom that caught fire like the dried flax ,</l>
     <l n="21">At need , and made her beautiful and fierce ,</l>
     <l n="22">Sudden and laughing .</l>
     <l n="23">O unquiet heart ,</l>
     <l n="24">Why do you praise another , praising her ,</l>
     <l n="25">As if there were no tale but your own tale</l>
     <l n="26">Worth knitting to a measure of sweet sound ?</l>
     <l n="27">Have I not bid you tell of that great queen</l>
     <l n="28">Who has been buried some two thousand years ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="29">When night was at its deepest , a wild goose</l>
     <l n="30">Cried from the porter 's lodge , and with long clamour</l>
     <l n="31">Shook the ale horns and shields upon their hooks ;</l>
     <l n="32">But the horse-boys slept on , as though some power</l>
     <l n="33">Had filled the house with Druid heaviness ;</l>
     <l n="34">And wondering who of the many changing Sidhe</l>
     <l n="35">Had come as in the old times to counsel her ,</l>
     <l n="36">Maeve walked , yet with slow footfall being old ,</l>
     <l n="37">To that small chamber by the outer gate .</l>
     <l n="38">The porter slept although he sat upright</l>
     <l n="39">With still and stony limbs and open eyes .</l>
     <l n="40">Maeve waited , and when that ear-piercing noise</l>
     <l n="41">Broke from his parted lips and broke again ,</l>
     <l n="42">She laid a hand on either of his shoulders ,</l>
     <l n="43">And shook him wide awake , and bid him say</l>
     <l n="44">Who of the wandering many-changing ones</l>
     <l n="45">Had troubled his sleep . But all he had to say</l>
     <l n="46">Was that , the air being heavy and the dogs</l>
     <l n="47">More still than they had been for a good month ,</l>
     <l n="48">He had fallen asleep , and , though he had dreamed nothing ,</l>
     <l n="49">He could remember when he had had fine dreams .</l>
     <l n="50">It was before the time of the great war</l>
     <l n="51">Over the White-Horned Bull , and the Brown Bull .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="52">She turned away ; he turned again to sleep</l>
     <l n="53">That no god troubled now , and , wondering</l>
     <l n="54">What matters were afoot among the Sidhe ,</l>
     <l n="55">Maeve walked through that great hall , and with a sigh</l>
     <l n="56">Lifted the curtain of her sleeping room ,</l>
     <l n="57">Remembering that she too had seemed divine</l>
     <l n="58">To many thousand eyes , and to her own</l>
     <l n="59">One that the generations had long waited</l>
     <l n="60">That work too difficult for mortal hands</l>
     <l n="61">Might be accomplished . Bunching the curtain up</l>
     <l n="62">She saw her husband Ailell sleeping there ,</l>
     <l n="63">And thought of days when he 'd had a straight body ,</l>
     <l n="64">And of that famous Fergus , Nessa 's husband ,</l>
     <l n="65">Who had been the lover of her middle life .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="66">Suddenly Ailell spoke out of his sleep ,</l>
     <l n="67">And not with his own voice or a man 's voice ,</l>
     <l n="68">But with the burning , live , unshaken voice</l>
     <l n="69">Of those that it may be can never age .</l>
     <l n="70">He said , ‘ High Queen of Cruachan and Mag Ai</l>
     <l n="71">A king of the Great Plain would speak with you . ’</l>
     <l n="72">And with glad voice Maeve answered him , ‘ What King</l>
     <l n="73">Of the far wandering shadows has come to me ?</l>
     <l n="74">As in the old days when they would come and go</l>
     <l n="75">About my threshold to counsel and to help . ’</l>
     <l n="76">The parted lips replied , ‘ I seek your help ,</l>
     <l n="77">For I am Aengus and I am crossed in love . ’</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="78">‘ How may a mortal whose life gutters out</l>
     <l n="79">Help them that wander with hand clasping hand</l>
     <l n="80">By rivers where nor rain nor hail has dimmed</l>
     <l n="81">Their haughty images , that cannot fade</l>
     <l n="82">Although their beauty 's like a hollow dream . ’</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="83">‘ I come from the undimmed rivers to bid you call</l>
     <l n="84">The children of the Maines out of sleep ,</l>
     <l n="85">And set them digging into Anbual 's hill .</l>
     <l n="86">We shadows , while they uproot his earthy house ,</l>
     <l n="87">Will overthrow his shadows and carry off</l>
     <l n="88">Caer , his blue eyed daughter that I love .</l>
     <l n="89">I helped your fathers when they built these walls</l>
     <l n="90">And I would have your help in my great need ,</l>
     <l n="91">Queen of high Cruachan . ’</l>
     <l n="92">‘ I obey your will</l>
     <l n="93">With speedy feet and a most thankful heart :</l>
     <l n="94">For you have been , O Aengus of the birds ,</l>
     <l n="95">Our giver of good counsel and good luck . ’</l>
     <l n="96">And with a groan , as if the mortal breath</l>
     <l n="97">Could but awaken sadly upon lips</l>
     <l n="98">That happier breath had moved , her husband turned</l>
     <l n="99">Face downward , tossing in a troubled sleep ;</l>
     <l n="100">But Maeve , and not with a slow feeble foot ,</l>
     <l n="101">Came to the threshold of the painted house ,</l>
     <l n="102">Where her grandchildren slept , and cried aloud ,</l>
     <l n="103">Until the pillared dark began to stir</l>
     <l n="104">With shouting and the clang of unhooked arms .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="105">She told them of the many-changing ones ;</l>
     <l n="106">And all that night , and all through the next day</l>
     <l n="107">To middle night , they dug into the hill .</l>
     <l n="108">At middle night great cats with silver claws ,</l>
     <l n="109">Bodies of shadow and blind eyes like pearls ,</l>
     <l n="110">Came up out of the hole , and red-eared hounds</l>
     <l n="111">With long white bodies came out of the air</l>
     <l n="112">Suddenly , and ran at them and harried them .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="113">The Maines ’ children dropped their spades , and stood</l>
     <l n="114">With quaking joints and terror strucken faces ,</l>
     <l n="115">Till Maeve called out , ‘ These are but common men .</l>
     <l n="116">The Maines ’ children have not dropped their spades</l>
     <l n="117">Because Earth crazy for its broken power</l>
     <l n="118">Casts up a show and the winds answer it</l>
     <l n="119">With holy shadows . ’ Her high heart was glad ,</l>
     <l n="120">And when the uproar ran along the grass</l>
     <l n="121">She followed with light footfall in the midst ,</l>
     <l n="122">Till it died out where an old thorn tree stood .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="123">Friend of these many years , you too had stood</l>
     <l n="124">With equal courage in that whirling rout ;</l>
     <l n="125">For you , although you 've not her wandering heart ,</l>
     <l n="126">Have all that greatness , and not hers alone .</l>
     <l n="127">For there is no high story about queens</l>
     <l n="128">In any ancient book but tells of you ,</l>
     <l n="129">And when I 've heard how they grew old and died</l>
     <l n="130">Or fell into unhappiness I 've said ;</l>
     <l n="131">‘ She will grow old and die and she has wept ! ’</l>
     <l n="132">And when I 'd write it out anew , the words ,</l>
     <l n="133">Half crazy with the thought , She too has wept !</l>
     <l n="134">Outrun the measure .</l>
     <l n="135">I 'd tell of that great queen</l>
     <l n="136">Who stood amid a silence by the thorn</l>
     <l n="137">Until two lovers came out of the air</l>
     <l n="138">With bodies made out of soft fire . The one</l>
     <l n="139">About whose face birds wagged their fiery wings</l>
     <l n="140">Said , ‘ Aengus and his sweetheart give their thanks</l>
     <l n="141">To Maeve and to Maeve 's household , owing all</l>
     <l n="142">In owing them the bride-bed that gives peace . ’</l>
     <l n="143">Then Maeve , ‘ O Aengus , Master of all lovers ,</l>
     <l n="144">A thousand years ago you held high talk</l>
     <l n="145">With the first kings of many pillared Cruachan .</l>
     <l n="146">O when will you grow weary . ’</l>
     <l n="147">They had vanished ,</l>
     <l n="148">But out of the dark air over her head there came</l>
     <l n="149">A murmur of soft words and meeting lips .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>BAILE AND AILLINN .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Argument . Baile and Aillinn were lovers , but</l>
     <l n="2">Aengus , the Master of Love , wishing them to be</l>
     <l n="3">happy in his own land among the dead , told to</l>
     <l n="4">each a story of the other 's death , so that their</l>
     <l n="5">hearts were broken and they died .</l>
     <l n="6">I hardly hear the curlew cry ,</l>
     <l n="7">Nor the grey rush when wind is high ,</l>
     <l n="8">Before my thoughts begin to run</l>
     <l n="9">On the heir of Ulad , Buan 's son ,</l>
     <l n="10">Baile who had the honey mouth ,</l>
     <l n="11">And that mild woman of the south ,</l>
     <l n="12">Aillinn , who was King Lugaid 's heir .</l>
     <l n="13">Their love was never drowned in care</l>
     <l n="14">Of this or that thing , nor grew cold</l>
     <l n="15">Because their bodies had grown old ;</l>
     <l n="16">Being forbid to marry on earth</l>
     <l n="17">They blossomed to immortal mirth .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="18">About the time when Christ was born ,</l>
     <l n="19">When the long wars for the White Horn</l>
     <l n="20">And the Brown Bull had not yet come ,</l>
     <l n="21">Young Baile Honey-Mouth , whom some</l>
     <l n="22">Called rather Baile Little-Land ,</l>
     <l n="23">Rode out of Emain with a band</l>
     <l n="24">Of harpers and young men , and they</l>
     <l n="25">Imagined , as they struck the way</l>
     <l n="26">To many pastured Muirthemne ,</l>
     <l n="27">That all things fell out happily</l>
     <l n="28">And there , for all that fools had said ,</l>
     <l n="29">Baile and Aillinn would be wed .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="30">They found an old man running there ,</l>
     <l n="31">He had ragged long grass-yellow hair ;</l>
     <l n="32">He had knees that stuck out of his hose ;</l>
     <l n="33">He had puddle water in his shoes ;</l>
     <l n="34">He had half a cloak to keep him dry ;</l>
     <l n="35">Although he had a squirrel 's eye .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="36">O wandering birds and rushy beds</l>
     <l n="37">You put such folly in our heads</l>
     <l n="38">With all this crying in the wind</l>
     <l n="39">No common love is to our mind ,</l>
     <l n="40">And our poor Kate or Nan is less</l>
     <l n="41">Than any whose unhappiness</l>
     <l n="42">Awoke the harp strings long ago .</l>
     <l n="43">Yet they that know all things but know</l>
     <l n="44">That all life had to give us is</l>
     <l n="45">A child 's laughter , a woman 's kiss .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="46">Who was it put so great a scorn</l>
     <l n="47">In the grey reeds that night and morn</l>
     <l n="48">Are trodden and broken by the herds ,</l>
     <l n="49">And in the light bodies of birds</l>
     <l n="50">That north wind tumbles to and fro</l>
     <l n="51">And pinches among hail and snow ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="52">That runner said , ‘ I am from the south ;</l>
     <l n="53">I run to Baile Honey-Mouth</l>
     <l n="54">To tell him how the girl Aillinn</l>
     <l n="55">Rode from the country of her kin</l>
     <l n="56">And old and young men rode with her :</l>
     <l n="57">For all that country had been astir</l>
     <l n="58">If anybody half as fair</l>
     <l n="59">Had chosen a husband anywhere</l>
     <l n="60">But where it could see her every day .</l>
     <l n="61">When they had ridden a little way</l>
     <l n="62">An old man caught the horse 's head</l>
     <l n="63">With “ You must home again and wed</l>
     <l n="64">With somebody in your own land . ”</l>
     <l n="65">A young man cried and kissed her hand</l>
     <l n="66">“ O lady , wed with one of us ; ”</l>
     <l n="67">And when no face grew piteous</l>
     <l n="68">For any gentle thing she spake</l>
     <l n="69">She fell and died of the heart-break . ’</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="70">Because a lover 's heart 's worn out</l>
     <l n="71">Being tumbled and blown about</l>
     <l n="72">By its own blind imagining ,</l>
     <l n="73">And will believe that anything</l>
     <l n="74">That is bad enough to be true , is true ,</l>
     <l n="75">Baile 's heart was broken in two ;</l>
     <l n="76">And he being laid upon green boughs</l>
     <l n="77">Was carried to the goodly house</l>
     <l n="78">Where the Hound of Ulad sat before</l>
     <l n="79">The brazen pillars of his door ;</l>
     <l n="80">His face bowed low to weep the end</l>
     <l n="81">Of the harper 's daughter and her friend ;</l>
     <l n="82">For although years had passed away</l>
     <l n="83">He always wept them on that day ,</l>
     <l n="84">For on that day they had been betrayed ;</l>

   <p>I made some of these poems walking about among the Seven Woods , before the big wind of nineteen hundred and three blew down so many trees , &amp; troubled the wild creatures , &amp; changed the look of things ; and I thought out there a good part of the play which follows . The first shape of it came to me in a dream , but it changed much in the making , foreshadowing , it may be , a change that may bring a less dream-burdened will into my verses . I never re-wrote anything so many times ; for at first I could not make these wills that stream into mere life poetical . But now I hope to do easily much more of the kind , and that our new Irish players will find the buskin and the sock .</p>

   <p>SCENE : A great hall by the sea close to Dundalgan . There are two great chairs on either side of the hall , each raised a little from the ground , and on the back of the one chair is carved and painted a woman with a fish 's tail , and on the back of the other a hound . There are smaller chairs and benches raised in tiers round the walls . There is a great ale vat at one side near a small door , &amp; a large door at the back through which one can see the sea . Barach , a tall thin man with long ragged hair , dressed in skins , comes in at the side door . He is leading Fintain , a fat blind man , who is somewhat older .</p>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>BARACH .</head>
    <head>I will shut the door , for this wind out of the sea gets into my bones , and if I leave but an inch for the wind there is one like a flake of sea-frost that might come into the house .</head>
    <head>FINTAIN .</head>
     <l n="1">What is his name , fool ?</l>
   </lg>
   <p>BARACH .</p>
   <p>It 's a woman from among the Riders of the Sidhe . It 's Boann herself from the river . She has left the Dagda 's bed , and gone through the salt of the sea &amp; up here to the strand of Baile , and all for love of me . Let her keep her husband 's bed , for she 'll have none of me . Nobody knows how lecherous these goddesses are . I see her in every kind of shape but oftener than not she 's in the wind and cries ‘ give a kiss and put your arms about me . ’ But no , she 'll have no more of me . Yesterday when I put out my lips to kiss her , there was nothing there but the wind . She 's bad , Fintain . O , she 's bad . I had better shut the big door too . ( He is going towards the big door but turns hearing Fintain 's voice . )</p>

   <p>BARACH .</p>
   <p>I was creeping under a ditch , with the fowl in my leather bag , keeping to the shore where the farmer could not see me , when I came upon a ship drawn up upon the sands , a great red ship with a woman 's head upon it .</p>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>FINTAIN .</head>
     <l n="1">A ship out of Aoife 's country . They have all a woman 's head on the bow .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>BARACH .</p>
   <p>There was a young man with a pale face and red hair standing beside it . Some of our people came up whose turn it was to guard the shore . I heard them ask the young man his name . He said he was under bonds not to tell it . Then words came between them , and they fought , &amp; the young man killed half of them , and the others ran away .</p>

    <head>Queen Aoife had a son that was red haired and pale faced like herself , and everyone said that he would kill Cuchullain some day , but I would not have that spoken of .</head>
    <head>BARACH .</head>
     <l n="1">Nobody could do that . Who was his father ?</l>
   </lg>
   <lg type="poem">

   <lg type="poem">
    <head>BARACH .</head>
     <l n="1">Not even he himself ! Was Aoife a goddess &amp; lecherous ?</l>
   </lg>
   <p>FINTAIN .</p>
   <p>I overheard her telling that she never had but one lover , and that he was the only man who overcame her in battle . There were some who thought him one of the Riders of the Sidhe , because the child was great of limb and strong beyond others . The child was begotten over the mountains ; but come nearer and I will tell you something .</p>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>BARACH .</head>
     <l n="1">You have thought something ?</l>
   </lg>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>FINTAIN .</head>
    <head>When I hear the young girls talking about the colour of Cuchullain 's eyes , &amp; how they have seven colours , I have thought about it . That young man has Aoife 's face and hair , but he has Cuchullain 's eyes .</head>
    <head>BARACH .</head>
     <l n="1">How can he have Cuchullain 's eyes ?</l>
   </lg>
   <lg type="poem">

     <l n="1">And his mother has sent him hither to fight his father .</l>
   </lg>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>FINTAIN .</head>
    <head>It is all quite plain . Cuchullain went into Aoife 's country when he was a young man that he might learn skill in arms , and there he became Aoife 's lover .</head>
    <head>BARACH .</head>
     <l n="1">And now she hates him because he went away , and has sent the son to</l>
     <l n="2">kill the father . I knew she was a goddess .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>FINTAIN .</p>
   <p>And she never told him who his father was , that he might do it . I have thought it all out , fool . I know a great many things because I listen when nobody is noticing and I keep my wits awake . What ails you now ?</p>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>BARACH .</head>
     <l n="1">I have remembered that I am hungry .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>FINTAIN .</p>
   <p>Well , forget it again , and I will tell you about Aoife 's country . It is full of wonders . There are a great many Queens there who can change themselves into wolves and into swine and into white hares , and when they are in their own shapes they are stronger than almost any man ; and there are young men there who have cat 's eyes and if a bird chirrup or a mouse squeak they cannot keep them shut even though it is bedtime and they sleepy ; and listen , for this is a great wonder , a very great wonder , there is a long narrow bridge , and when anybody goes to cross it , that the Queens do not like , it flies up as this bench would if you were to sit on the end of it . Everybody who goes there to learn skill in arms has to cross it . It was in that country too that Cuchullain got his spear made out of dragon bones . There were two dragons fighting in the foam of the sea , &amp; their grandam was the moon , and six Queens came along the shore .</p>
   <lg type="poem">

   <p>( Who is being led along very slowly and unwillingly . ) Yes , I have a good head . The fowl should be done just right , but one never knows when a wild dog may come out of the woods .
