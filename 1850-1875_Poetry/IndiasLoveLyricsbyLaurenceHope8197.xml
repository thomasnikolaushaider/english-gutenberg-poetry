     <l n="18">Once ,— Ah , the Gods were good to me ,— I threw</l>

     <l n="28">The fields are full of Poppies , and the skies are very blue ,</l>
     <l n="29">By the Temple in the coppice , I wait , Beloved , for you .</l>
     <l n="30">The level land is sunny , and the errant air is gay ,</l>
     <l n="31">With scent of rose and honey ; will you come to me to-day ?</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="32">From carven walls above me , smile lovers ; many a pair .</l>

     <l n="36">Through centuries together , in the carven stone they lie ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="40">The Temple bells are ringing , for the marriage month has come .</l>
     <l n="41">I hear the women singing , and the throbbing of the drum .</l>
     <l n="42">And when the song is failing , or the drums a moment mute ,</l>
     <l n="43">The weirdly wistful wailing of the melancholy flute .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="44">Little life has got to offer , and little man to lose ,</l>
     <l n="45">Since to-day Fate deigns to proffer , Oh wherefore , then , refuse</l>
     <l n="46">To take this transient hour , in the dusky Temple gloom</l>
     <l n="47">While the poppies are in flower , and the mangoe trees abloom .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="48">And if Fate remember later , and come to claim her due ,</l>
     <l n="49">What sorrow will be greater than the Joy I had with you ?</l>
     <l n="50">For to-day , lit by your laughter , between the crushing years ,</l>
     <l n="51">I will chance , in the hereafter , eternities of tears .</l>

     <l n="53">The Desert is parched in the burning sun</l>
     <l n="54">And the grass is scorched and white .</l>
     <l n="55">But the sand is passed , and the march is done ,</l>
     <l n="56">We are camping here to-night .</l>
     <l n="57">I sit in the shade of the Temple walls ,</l>
     <l n="58">While the cadenced water evenly falls ,</l>
     <l n="59">And a peacock out of the Jungle calls</l>
     <l n="60">To another , on yonder tomb .</l>
     <l n="61">Above , half seen , in the lofty gloom ,</l>
     <l n="62">Strange works of a long dead people loom ,</l>
     <l n="63">Obscene and savage and half effaced —</l>
     <l n="64">An elephant hunt , a musicians ’ feast —</l>
     <l n="65">And curious matings of man and beast ;</l>
     <l n="66">What did they mean to the men who are long since dust ?</l>
     <l n="67">Whose fingers traced ,</l>
     <l n="68">In this arid waste ,</l>
     <l n="69">These rioting , twisted , figures of love and lust .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="70">Strange , weird things that no man may say ,</l>

     <l n="73">Catch the light of the living day ,</l>
     <l n="74">Smile in the sun .</l>
     <l n="75">Cruel things that man may not name ,</l>
     <l n="76">Naked here , without fear or shame ,</l>
     <l n="77">Laughed in the carven stone .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="19">
     <l n="78">Deep in the Temple 's innermost Shrine is set ,</l>
     <l n="79">Where the bats and shadows dwell ,</l>
     <l n="80">The worn and ancient Symbol of Life , at rest</l>
     <l n="81">In its oval shell ,</l>
     <l n="82">By which the men , who , of old , the land possessed ,</l>
     <l n="83">Represented their Great Destroying Power .</l>
     <l n="84">I cannot forget</l>
     <l n="85">That , just as my life was touching its fullest flower ,</l>
     <l n="86">Love came and destroyed it all in a single hour ,</l>
     <l n="87">Therefore the dual Mystery suits me well .</l>

     <l n="88">Sitting alone ,</l>
     <l n="89">The tank 's deep water is cool and sweet ,</l>
     <l n="90">Soothing and fresh to the wayworn feet ,</l>
     <l n="91">Dreaming , under the Tamarind shade ,</l>
     <l n="92">One silently thanks the men who made</l>
     <l n="93">So green a place in this bitter land</l>
     <l n="94">Of sunburnt sand .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="21">
     <l n="95">The peacocks scream and the grey Doves coo ,</l>
     <l n="96">Little green , talkative Parrots woo ,</l>
     <l n="97">And small grey Squirrels , with fear askance ,</l>
     <l n="98">At alien me , in their furtive glance ,</l>
     <l n="99">Come shyly , with quivering fur , to see</l>
     <l n="100">The stranger under their Tamarind tree .</l>
     <l n="101">Daylight dies ,</l>
     <l n="102">The Camp fires redden like angry eyes ,</l>
     <l n="103">The Tents show white ,</l>
     <l n="104">In the glimmering light ,</l>

     <l n="107">Drifting over the sand to me .</l>
     <l n="108">Afar , in the Desert some wild voice sings</l>
     <l n="109">To a jangling zither with minor strings ,</l>
     <l n="110">And , under the stars growing keen above ,</l>
     <l n="111">I think of the thing that I love .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="22">
     <l n="112">A beautiful thing , alert , serene ,</l>
     <l n="113">With passionate , dreaming , wistful eyes ,</l>

     <l n="115">Seen from a vessel at sea .</l>
     <l n="116">Alas , you drifted away from me ,</l>
     <l n="117">And Time and Space have rushed in between ,</l>
     <l n="118">But they cannot undo the Thing-that-has-been ,</l>
     <l n="119">Though it never again may be .</l>
     <l n="120">You were mine , from dusk until dawning light ,</l>
     <l n="121">For the perfect whole of that bygone night</l>

     <l n="123">They say that Love is a light thing ,</l>
     <l n="124">A foolish thing and a slight thing ,</l>

     <l n="126">They speak in this futile fashion</l>
     <l n="127">To me , who am wracked with passion ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="24">
     <l n="130">They say that Possession lessens a lover 's delight ,</l>
     <l n="131">As radiant mornings fade into afternoon .</l>
     <l n="132">I held what I loved in my arms for many a night ,</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="25">
     <l n="134">Beyond our tents the sands stretch level and far ,</l>
     <l n="135">Around this little oasis of Tamarind trees .</l>
     <l n="136">A curious , Eastern fragrance fills the breeze</l>
     <l n="137">From the ruinous Temple garden where roses are .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="26">
     <l n="138">I dream of the rose-like perfume that fills your hair ,</l>
     <l n="139">Of times when my lips were free of your soft closed eyes ,</l>
     <l n="140">While down in the tank the waters ripple and rise</l>
     <l n="141">And the flying foxes silently cleave the air .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="27">
     <l n="142">The present is subtly welded into the past ,</l>
     <l n="143">My love of you with the purple Indian dusk ,</l>
     <l n="144">With its clinging scent of sandal incense and musk ,</l>
     <l n="145">And withering jasmin flowers .</l>
     <l n="146">My eyes grow dim and my senses fail at last ,</l>
     <l n="147">While the lonely hours</l>
     <l n="148">Follow each other , silently , one by one ,</l>
     <l n="149">Till the night is almost done .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="28">
     <l n="150">Then weary , and drunk with dreams , with my garments damp</l>
     <l n="151">And heavy with dew , I wander towards the camp .</l>
     <l n="152">Tired , with a brain in which fancy and fact are blent ,</l>
     <l n="153">I stumble across the ropes till I reach my tent</l>
     <l n="154">And then to rest . To ensweeten my sleep with lies ,</l>
     <l n="155">To dream I lie in the light of your long lost eyes ,</l>
     <l n="156">My lips set free .</l>
     <l n="157">To love and linger over your soft loose hair —</l>
     <l n="158">To dream I lay your delicate beauty bare</l>
     <l n="159">To solace my fevered eyes .</l>
     <l n="160">Ah ,— if my life might end in a night like this —</l>
