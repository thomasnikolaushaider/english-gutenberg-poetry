    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">THE host is riding from Knocknarea</l>
     <l n="2">And over the grave of Clooth-na-bare ;</l>
     <l n="3">Caolte tossing his burning hair</l>
     <l n="4">And Niamh calling Away , come away :</l>
     <l n="5">Empty your heart of its mortal dream .</l>
     <l n="6">The winds awaken , the leaves whirl round ,</l>
     <l n="7">Our cheeks are pale , our hair is unbound ,</l>
     <l n="8">Our breasts are heaving , our eyes are a-gleam ,</l>
     <l n="9">Our arms are waving , our lips are apart ;</l>
     <l n="10">And if any gaze on our rushing band ,</l>
     <l n="11">We come between him and the deed of his hand ,</l>
     <l n="12">We come between him and the hope of his heart .</l>
     <l n="13">The host is rushing ’ twixt night and day ,</l>
     <l n="14">And where is there hope or deed as fair ?</l>
     <l n="15">Caolte tossing his burning hair ,</l>
     <l n="16">And Niamh calling Away , come away .</l>

    <p>THE EVERLASTING VOICES</p>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="17">O SWEET everlasting Voices , be still ;</l>
     <l n="18">Go to the guards of the heavenly fold</l>
     <l n="19">And bid them wander obeying your will</l>
     <l n="20">Flame under flame , till Time be no more ;</l>
     <l n="21">Have you not heard that our hearts are old ,</l>
     <l n="22">That you call in birds , in wind on the hill ,</l>
     <l n="23">In shaken boughs , in tide on the shore ?</l>
     <l n="24">O sweet everlasting Voices , be still .</l>

    <p>THE MOODS</p>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="25">TIME drops in decay ,</l>
     <l n="26">Like a candle burnt out ,</l>
     <l n="27">And the mountains and woods</l>
     <l n="28">Have their day , have their day ;</l>
     <l n="29">What one in the rout</l>
     <l n="30">Of the fire-born moods</l>
     <l n="31">Has fallen away ?</l>

    <p>THE LOVER TELLS OF THE ROSE IN HIS HEART</p>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="32">ALL things uncomely and broken , all things worn out and old ,</l>
     <l n="33">The cry of a child by the roadway , the creak of a lumbering cart ,</l>
     <l n="34">The heavy steps of the ploughman , splashing the wintry mould ,</l>
     <l n="35">Are wronging your image that blossoms a rose in the deeps of my heart .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="36">The wrong of unshapely things is a wrong too great to be told ;</l>
     <l n="37">I hunger to build them anew and sit on a green knoll apart ,</l>
     <l n="38">With the earth and the sky and the water , remade , like a casket of gold</l>
     <l n="39">For my dreams of your image that blossoms a rose in the deeps of my</l>
     <l n="40">heart .</l>

    <p>THE HOST OF THE AIR</p>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="41">O ’ DRISCOLL drove with a song</l>
     <l n="42">The wild duck and the drake</l>
     <l n="43">From the tall and the tufted reeds</l>
     <l n="44">Of the drear Hart Lake .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="45">And he saw how the reeds grew dark</l>
     <l n="46">At the coming of night tide ,</l>
     <l n="47">And dreamed of the long dim hair</l>
     <l n="48">Of Bridget his bride .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="49">He heard while he sang and dreamed</l>
     <l n="50">A piper piping away ,</l>
     <l n="51">And never was piping so sad ,</l>
     <l n="52">And never was piping so gay .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="53">And he saw young men and young girls</l>
     <l n="54">Who danced on a level place</l>
     <l n="55">And Bridget his bride among them ,</l>
     <l n="56">With a sad and a gay face .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="57">The dancers crowded about him ,</l>
     <l n="58">And many a sweet thing said ,</l>
     <l n="59">And a young man brought him red wine</l>
     <l n="60">And a young girl white bread .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="61">But Bridget drew him by the sleeve ,</l>
     <l n="62">Away from the merry bands ,</l>
     <l n="63">To old men playing at cards</l>
     <l n="64">With a twinkling of ancient hands .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="65">The bread and the wine had a doom ,</l>
     <l n="66">For these were the host of the air ;</l>
     <l n="67">He sat and played in a dream</l>
     <l n="68">Of her long dim hair .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="69">He played with the merry old men</l>
     <l n="70">And thought not of evil chance ,</l>
     <l n="71">Until one bore Bridget his bride</l>
     <l n="72">Away from the merry dance .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="73">He bore her away in his arms ,</l>
     <l n="74">The handsomest young man there ,</l>
     <l n="75">And his neck and his breast and his arms</l>
     <l n="76">Were drowned in her long dim hair .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="77">O ’ Driscoll scattered the cards</l>
     <l n="78">And out of his dream awoke :</l>
     <l n="79">Old men and young men and young girls</l>
     <l n="80">Were gone like a drifting smoke ;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="81">But he heard high up in the air</l>
     <l n="82">A piper piping away ,</l>
     <l n="83">And never was piping so sad ,</l>
     <l n="84">And never was piping so gay .</l>
    </lg>
    <p>THE FISHERMAN</p>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="85">ALTHOUGH you hide in the ebb and flow</l>
     <l n="86">Of the pale tide when the moon has set ,</l>
     <l n="87">The people of coming days will know</l>
     <l n="88">About the casting out of my net ,</l>
     <l n="89">And how you have leaped times out of mind</l>
     <l n="90">Over the little silver cords ,</l>
     <l n="91">And think that you were hard and unkind ,</l>
     <l n="92">And blame you with many bitter words .</l>
    </lg>
    <p>A CRADLE SONG</p>
    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="93">THE Danaan children laugh , in cradles of wrought gold ,</l>
     <l n="94">And clap their hands together , and half close their eyes ,</l>
     <l n="95">For they will ride the North when the ger-eagle flies ,</l>
     <l n="96">With heavy whitening wings , and a heart fallen cold :</l>
     <l n="97">I kiss my wailing child and press it to my breast ,</l>
     <l n="98">And hear the narrow graves calling my child and me .</l>
     <l n="99">Desolate winds that cry over the wandering sea ;</l>
     <l n="100">Desolate winds that hover in the flaming West ;</l>
     <l n="101">Desolate winds that beat the doors of Heaven , and beat</l>
     <l n="102">The doors of Hell and blow there many a whimpering ghost ;</l>
     <l n="103">O heart the winds have shaken ; the unappeasable host</l>
     <l n="104">Is comelier than candles at Mother Mary ’ s feet .</l>
    </lg>
    <p>INTO THE TWILIGHT</p>
    <lg type="stanza" n="19">
     <l n="105">OUT-WORN heart , in a time out-worn ,</l>
     <l n="106">Come clear of the nets of wrong and right ;</l>
     <l n="107">Laugh , heart , again in the gray twilight ,</l>
     <l n="108">Sigh , heart , again in the dew of the morn .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="20">
     <l n="109">Your mother Eire is always young ,</l>
     <l n="110">Dew ever shining and twilight gray ;</l>
     <l n="111">Though hope fall from you and love decay ,</l>
     <l n="112">Burning in fires of a slanderous tongue .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="21">
     <l n="113">Come , heart , where hill is heaped upon hill</l>
     <l n="114">For there the mystical brotherhood</l>
     <l n="115">Of sun and moon and hollow and wood</l>
     <l n="116">And river and stream work out their will ;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="22">
     <l n="117">And God stands winding His lonely horn ,</l>
     <l n="118">And time and the world are ever in flight ;</l>
     <l n="119">And love is less kind than the gray twilight</l>
     <l n="120">And hope is less dear than the dew of the morn .</l>
    </lg>
    <p>THE SONG OF WANDERING AENGUS</p>
    <lg type="stanza" n="23">
     <l n="121">I WENT out to the hazel wood ,</l>
     <l n="122">Because a fire was in my head ,</l>
     <l n="123">And cut and peeled a hazel wand ,</l>
     <l n="124">And hooked a berry to a thread ;</l>
     <l n="125">And when white moths were on the wing ,</l>
     <l n="126">And moth-like stars were flickering out ,</l>
     <l n="127">I dropped the berry in a stream</l>
     <l n="128">And caught a little silver trout .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="24">
     <l n="129">When I had laid it on the floor</l>
     <l n="130">I went to blow the fire a-flame ,</l>
     <l n="131">But something rustled on the floor ,</l>
     <l n="132">And someone called me by my name :</l>
     <l n="133">It had become a glimmering girl</l>
     <l n="134">With apple blossom in her hair</l>
     <l n="135">Who called me by my name and ran</l>
     <l n="136">And faded through the brightening air .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="25">
     <l n="137">Though I am old with wandering</l>
     <l n="138">Through hollow lands and hilly lands ,</l>
     <l n="139">I will find out where she has gone ,</l>
     <l n="140">And kiss her lips and take her hands ;</l>
     <l n="141">And walk among long dappled grass ,</l>
     <l n="142">And pluck till time and times are done</l>
     <l n="143">The silver apples of the moon ,</l>
     <l n="144">The golden apples of the sun .</l>
    </lg>
    <p>THE HEART OF THE WOMAN</p>
    <lg type="stanza" n="26">
     <l n="145">O WHAT to me the little room</l>
     <l n="146">That was brimmed up with prayer and rest ;</l>
     <l n="147">He bade me out into the gloom ,</l>
     <l n="148">And my breast lies upon his breast .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="27">
     <l n="149">O what to me my mother ’ s care ,</l>
     <l n="150">The house where I was safe and warm ;</l>
     <l n="151">The shadowy blossom of my hair</l>
     <l n="152">Will hide us from the bitter storm .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="28">
     <l n="153">O hiding hair and dewy eyes ,</l>
     <l n="154">I am no more with life and death ,</l>
     <l n="155">My heart upon his warm heart lies ,</l>
     <l n="156">My breath is mixed into his breath .</l>
    </lg>
    <p>THE LOVER MOURNS FOR THE LOSS OF LOVE</p>
    <lg type="stanza" n="29">
     <l n="157">PALE brows , still hands and dim hair ,</l>
     <l n="158">I had a beautiful friend</l>
     <l n="159">And dreamed that the old despair</l>
     <l n="160">Would end in love in the end :</l>
     <l n="161">She looked in my heart one day</l>
     <l n="162">And saw your image was there ;</l>
     <l n="163">She has gone weeping away .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="30">
     <l n="164">HE MOURNS FOR THE CHANGE THAT HAS COME UPON HIM AND HIS BELOVED AND</l>
     <l n="165">LONGS FOR THE END OF THE WORLD</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="31">
     <l n="166">DO you not hear me calling , white deer with no horns !</l>
     <l n="167">I have been changed to a hound with one red ear ;</l>
     <l n="168">I have been in the Path of Stones and the Wood of Thorns ,</l>
     <l n="169">For somebody hid hatred and hope and desire and fear</l>
     <l n="170">Under my feet that they follow you night and day .</l>
     <l n="171">A man with a hazel wand came without sound ;</l>
     <l n="172">He changed me suddenly ; I was looking another way ;</l>
     <l n="173">And now my calling is but the calling of a hound ;</l>

    <head>THE SONG OF THE HAPPY SHEPHERD</head>
     <l n="1">THE woods of Arcady are dead ,</l>
     <l n="2">And over is their antique joy ;</l>
     <l n="3">Of old the world on dreaming fed ;</l>
     <l n="4">Gray Truth is now her painted toy ;</l>
     <l n="5">Yet still she turns her restless head :</l>
     <l n="6">But O , sick children of the world ,</l>
     <l n="7">Of all the many changing things</l>
     <l n="8">In dreary dancing past us whirled ,</l>
     <l n="9">To the cracked tune that Chronos sings ,</l>
     <l n="10">Words alone are certain good .</l>
     <l n="11">Where are now the warring kings ,</l>
     <l n="12">Word bemockers ?— By the Rood</l>
     <l n="13">Where are now the warring kings ?</l>
     <l n="14">An idle word is now their glory ,</l>
     <l n="15">By the stammering schoolboy said ,</l>
     <l n="16">Reading some entangled story :</l>
     <l n="17">The kings of the old time are fled .</l>
     <l n="18">The wandering earth herself may be</l>
     <l n="19">Only a sudden flaming word ,</l>
     <l n="20">In clanging space a moment heard ,</l>
     <l n="21">Troubling the endless reverie .</l>
     <l n="22">Then no wise worship dusty deeds ,</l>
     <l n="23">Nor seek — for this is also sooth —</l>
     <l n="24">To hunger fiercely after truth ,</l>
     <l n="25">Lest all thy toiling only breeds</l>
     <l n="26">New dreams , new dreams ; there is no truth</l>
     <l n="27">Saving in thine own heart . Seek , then ,</l>
     <l n="28">No learning from the starry men ,</l>
     <l n="29">Who follow with the optic glass</l>
     <l n="30">The whirling ways of stars that pass ;</l>
     <l n="31">Seek , then — for this is also sooth —</l>
     <l n="32">No word of theirs : the cold star-bane</l>
     <l n="33">Has cloven and rent their hearts in twain ,</l>
     <l n="34">And dead is all their human truth .</l>
     <l n="35">Go , gather by the humming sea</l>
     <l n="36">Some twisted , echo-harbouring shell ,</l>
     <l n="37">And to its lips thy story tell ,</l>
     <l n="38">And they thy comforters will be ,</l>
     <l n="39">Rewording in melodious guile</l>
     <l n="40">Thy fretful words a little while ,</l>
     <l n="41">Till they shall singing fade in ruth ,</l>
     <l n="42">And die a pearly brotherhood ;</l>
     <l n="43">For words alone are certain good :</l>
     <l n="44">Sing , then , for this is also sooth .</l>
     <l n="45">I must be gone : there is a grave</l>
     <l n="46">Where daffodil and lily wave ,</l>
     <l n="47">And I would please the hapless faun ,</l>
     <l n="48">Buried under the sleepy ground ,</l>
     <l n="49">With mirthful songs before the dawn .</l>
     <l n="50">His shouting days with mirth were crowned ;</l>
     <l n="51">And still I dream he treads the lawn ,</l>
     <l n="52">Walking ghostly in the dew ,</l>
     <l n="53">Pierced by my glad singing through ,</l>
     <l n="54">My songs of old earth ’ s dreamy youth :</l>
     <l n="55">But ah ! she dreams not now ; dream thou !</l>
     <l n="56">For fair are poppies on the brow :</l>

    <head>THE SAD SHEPHERD</head>

     <l n="21">Their sadness through a hollow , pearly heart ;</l>
     <l n="22">And my own tale again for me shall sing ,</l>
     <l n="23">And my own whispering words be comforting ,</l>
     <l n="24">And lo ! my ancient burden may depart .</l>
     <l n="25">Then he sang softly nigh the pearly rim ;</l>
     <l n="26">But the sad dweller by the sea-ways lone</l>
     <l n="27">Changed all he sang to inarticulate moan</l>
     <l n="28">Among her wildering whirls , forgetting him .</l>

     <l n="16">A pearl-pale , high-born lady , who rode</l>
     <l n="17">On a horse with bridle of findrinny ;</l>
     <l n="18">And like a sunset were her lips ,</l>
     <l n="19">A stormy sunset on doomed ships ;</l>
     <l n="20">A citron colour gloomed in her hair ,</l>
     <l n="21">But down to her feet white vesture flowed ,</l>
     <l n="22">And with the glimmering crimson glowed</l>
     <l n="23">Of many a figured embroidery ;</l>
     <l n="24">And it was bound with a pearl-pale shell</l>
     <l n="25">That wavered like the summer streams ,</l>

     <l n="38">The horse towards the music raced ,</l>

     <l n="40">Like sooty fingers , many a tree</l>
     <l n="41">Rose ever out of the warm sea ;</l>

     <l n="43">As though they all were beating time ,</l>
     <l n="44">Upon the centre of the sun ,</l>
     <l n="45">To that low laughing woodland rhyme .</l>
     <l n="46">And , now our wandering hours were done ,</l>

     <l n="48">The reason of the trembling trees :</l>
     <l n="49">Round every branch the song-birds flew ,</l>
     <l n="50">Or clung thereon like swarming bees ;</l>
     <l n="51">While round the shore a million stood</l>

     <l n="53">And pondered in a soft vain mood ,</l>
     <l n="54">Upon their shadows in the tide ,</l>
     <l n="55">And told the purple deeps their pride ,</l>
     <l n="56">And murmured snatches of delight ;</l>
     <l n="57">And on the shores were many boats</l>
     <l n="58">With bending sterns and bending bows ,</l>

     <l n="65">Out of a little silver trump ;</l>
     <l n="66">And then an answering whisper flew</l>
     <l n="67">Over the bare and woody land ,</l>
     <l n="68">A whisper of impetuous feet ,</l>
     <l n="69">And ever nearer , nearer grew ;</l>
     <l n="70">And from the woods rushed out a band</l>
     <l n="71">Of men and maidens , hand in hand ,</l>
     <l n="72">And singing , singing altogether ;</l>
     <l n="73">Their brows were white as fragrant milk ,</l>
     <l n="74">Their cloaks made out of yellow silk ,</l>

     <l n="76">And when they saw the cloak I wore</l>
     <l n="77">Was dim with mire of a mortal shore ,</l>
     <l n="78">They fingered it and gazed on me</l>
     <l n="79">And laughed like murmurs of the sea ;</l>

     <l n="81">Bid them away and hold their peace ;</l>

     <l n="85">Her pearl-pale hand and the hem of her dress .</l>
     <l n="86">She bade them bring us to the hall</l>
     <l n="87">Where Aengus dreams , from sun to sun ,</l>

     <l n="110">And , weeping over the white strings , hurled</l>
     <l n="111">It down in a leaf-hid hollow place</l>
     <l n="112">That kept dim waters from the sky ;</l>
     <l n="113">And each one said with a long , long sigh ,</l>

     <l n="176">And bending over them softly said ,</l>

     <l n="183">Heaped beside the glimmering waves ,</l>
     <l n="184">Shall fall the leaves of damask roses .</l>
     <l n="185">For neither Death nor Change comes near us ,</l>
     <l n="186">And all listless hours fear us ,</l>

     <l n="189">The dance wound through the windless woods ;</l>

     <l n="8">From some dead warrior ’ s broken lance :</l>
     <l n="9">I turned it in my hands ; the stains</l>

     <l n="19">And found the horse and bridled him ,</l>
     <l n="20">For we knew well the old was over .</l>
     <l n="21">I heard one say ‘ his eyes grow dim</l>
     <l n="22">With all the ancient sorrow of men ’;</l>

     <l n="24">With hoofs of the pale findrinny</l>

     <l n="26">Under the golden evening light .</l>
     <l n="27">The immortals moved among the fountains</l>
     <l n="28">By rivers and the woods ’ old night ;</l>
     <l n="29">Some danced like shadows on the mountains ,</l>
     <l n="30">Some wandered ever hand in hand ,</l>

     <l n="32">Each forehead like an obscure star</l>

     <l n="34">And sang , and with a dreamy gaze</l>
     <l n="35">Watched where the sun in a saffron blaze</l>
     <l n="36">Was slumbering half in the sea ways ;</l>
     <l n="37">And , as they sang , the painted birds</l>
     <l n="38">Kept time with their bright wings and feet ;</l>

     <l n="44">Grown desolate , whisper and sigh to each other ;</l>
     <l n="45">He hears the storm in the chimney above ,</l>
     <l n="46">And bends to the fire and shakes with the cold ,</l>
     <l n="47">While his heart still dreams of battle and love ,</l>

     <l n="49">‘ But we are apart in the grassy places ,</l>

     <l n="56">She limps along in an aged whiteness ;</l>
     <l n="57">A storm of birds in the Asian trees</l>
     <l n="58">Like tulips in the air a-winging ,</l>
     <l n="59">And the gentle waves of the summer seas ,</l>
     <l n="60">That raise their heads and wander singing ,</l>
     <l n="61">Must murmur at last “ unjust , unjust ”;</l>
     <l n="62">And “ my speed is a weariness ,” falters the mouse ;</l>
     <l n="63">And the kingfisher turns to a ball of dust ,</l>
     <l n="64">And the roof falls in of his tunnelled house .</l>
     <l n="65">But the love-dew dims our eyes till the day</l>
     <l n="66">When God shall come from the sea with a sigh</l>

    <p n="1">THE WIND AMONG THE REEDS .</p>
    <p n="2">When I wrote these poems I had so meditated over the images that came to me in writing ‘ Ballads and Lyrics ,’ ‘ The Rose ,’ and ‘ The Wanderings of Oisin ,’ and other images from Irish folk-lore , that they had become true symbols . I had sometimes when awake , but more often in sleep , moments of vision , a state very unlike dreaming , when these images took upon themselves what seemed an independent life and became a part of a mystic language , which seemed always as if it would bring me some strange revelation . Being troubled at what was thought a reckless obscurity , I tried to explain myself in lengthy notes , into which I put all the little learning I had , and more wilful phantasy than I now think admirable , though what is most mystical still seems to me the most true . I quote in what follows the better or the more necessary passages .</p>
    <p n="3">THE HOSTING OF THE SIDHE ( page 3 ) .</p>
    <p n="4">The gods of ancient Ireland , the Tuatha De Danaan , or the Tribes of the goddess Danu , or the Sidhe , from Aes Sidhe , or Sluagh Sidhe , the people of the Faery Hills , as these words are usually explained , still ride the country as of old . Sidhe is also Gaelic for wind , and certainly the Sidhe have much to do with the wind . They journey in whirling winds , the winds that were called the dance of the daughters of Herodias in the Middle Ages , Herodias doubtless taking the place of some old goddess . When the country people see the leaves whirling on the road they bless themselves , because they believe the Sidhe to be passing by . They are almost always said to wear no covering upon their heads , and to let their hair stream out ; and the great among them , for they have great and simple , go much upon horseback . If any one becomes too much interested in them , and sees them overmuch , he loses all interest in ordinary things .</p>
    <p n="5">A woman near Gort , in Galway , says : ‘ There is a boy , now , of the Clorans ; but I wouldn ’ t for the world let them think I spoke of him ; it ’ s two years since he came from America , and since that time he never went to Mass , or to church , or to fairs , or to market , or to stand on the cross roads , or to hurling , or to nothing . And if any one comes into the house , it ’ s into the room he ’ ll slip , not to see them ; and as to work , he has the garden dug to bits , and the whole place smeared with cow dung ; and such a crop as was never seen ; and the alders all plaited till they look grand . One day he went as far as the chapel ; but as soon as he got to the door he turned straight round again , as if he hadn ’ t power to pass it . I wonder he wouldn ’ t get the priest to read a Mass for him , or something ; but the crop he has is grand , and you may know well he has some to help him .’ One hears many stories of the kind ; and a man whose son is believed to go out riding among them at night tells me that he is careless about everything , and lies in bed until it is late in the day . A doctor believes this boy to be mad . Those that are at times ‘ away ,’ as it is called , know all things , but are afraid to speak . A countryman at Kiltartan says , ‘ There was one of the Lydons — John — was away for seven years , lying in his bed , but brought away at nights , and he knew everything ; and one , Kearney , up in the mountains , a cousin of his own , lost two hoggets , and came and told him , and he knew the very spot where they were , and told him , and he got them back again . But they were vexed at that , and took away the power , so that he never knew anything again , no more than another .’</p>
    <p n="6">Knocknarea is in Sligo , and the country people say that Maeve , still a great queen of the western Sidhe , is buried in the cairn of stones upon it . I have written of Clooth-na-Bare in ‘ The Celtic Twilight .’ She ‘ went all over the world , seeking a lake deep enough to drown her faery life , of which she had grown weary , leaping from hill to hill , and setting up a cairn of stones wherever her feet lighted , until , at last , she found the deepest water in the world in little Lough Ia , on the top of the bird mountain , in Sligo .’ I forget , now , where I heard this story , but it may have been from a priest at Collooney . Clooth-na-Bare would mean the old woman of Bare , but is evidently a corruption of Cailleac Bare , the old woman of Bare , who , under the names Bare , and Berah , and Beri , and Verah , and Dera , and Dhira , appears in the legends of many places . Mr. O ’ Grady found her haunting Lough Liath high up on the top of a mountain of the Fews , the Slieve Fuadh , or Slieve G-Cullain of old times , under the name of the Cailleac Buillia . He describes Lough Liath as a desolate moon-shaped lake , with made wells and sunken passages upon its borders , and beset by marsh and heather and gray boulders , and closes his ‘ Flight of the Eagle ’ with a long rhapsody upon mountain and lake , because of the heroic tales and beautiful old myths that have hung about them always . He identifies the Cailleac Buillia with that Meluchra who persuaded Fionn to go to her amid the waters of Lough Liath , and so changed him with her enchantments , that , though she had to free him because of the threats of the Fiana , his hair was ever afterwards as white as snow . To this day the Tuatha De Danaan that are in the waters beckon to men , and drown them in the waters ; and Bare , or Dhira , or Meluchra , or whatever name one likes the best , is , doubtless , the name of a mistress among them . Meluchra was daughter of Cullain ; and Cullain Mr. O ’ Grady calls , upon I know not what authority , a form of Lir , the master of waters . The people of the waters have been in all ages beautiful and changeable and lascivious , or beautiful and wise and lonely , for water is everywhere the signature of the fruitfulness of the body and of the fruitfulness of dreams . The white hair of Fionn may be but another of the troubles of those that come to unearthly wisdom and earthly trouble , and the threats and violence of the Fiana against her , a different form of the threats and violence the country people use , to make the Aes Sidhe give up those that are ‘ away .’ Bare is now often called an ugly old woman , but in the ‘ Song of Bare ,’ which Lady Gregory has given in her ‘ Saints and Wonders ,’ she laments her lost beauty after the withering of seven hundred years ; and Dr. Joyce says that one of her old names was Aebhin , which means beautiful . Aebhin was the goddess of the tribes of northern Leinster ; and the lover she had made immortal , and who loved her perfectly , left her , and put on mortality , to fight among them against the stranger , and died on the strand of Clontarf .</p>

    <p n="8">The Rose has been for many centuries a symbol of spiritual love and supreme beauty . The lotus was in some Eastern countries imagined blossoming upon the Tree of Life , as the Flower of Life , and is thus represented in Assyrian bas-reliefs . Because the Rose , the flower sacred to the Virgin Mary , and the flower that Apuleius ’ adventurer ate , when he was changed out of the ass ’ s shape and received into the fellowship of Isis , is the western Flower of Life , I have imagined it growing upon the Tree of Life . I once stood beside a man in Ireland when he saw it growing there in a vision , that seemed to have rapt him out of his body . He saw the Garden of Eden walled about , and on the top of a high mountain , as in certain mediæval diagrams , and after passing the Tree of Knowledge , on which grew fruit full of troubled faces , and through whose branches flowed , he was told , sap that was human souls , he came to a tall , dark tree , with little bitter fruits , and was shown a kind of stair or ladder going up through the tree , and told to go up ; and near the top of the tree , a beautiful woman , like the Goddess of Life , associated with the tree in Assyria , gave him a rose that seemed to have been growing upon the tree . One finds the Rose in the Irish poets , sometimes as a religious symbol , as in the phrase , ‘ the Rose of Friday ,’ meaning the Rose of austerity , in a Gaelic poem in Dr. Hyde ’ s ‘ Religious Songs of Connacht ’; and , I think , as a symbol of woman ’ s beauty in the Gaelic song , ‘ Roseen Dubh ’; and a symbol of Ireland in Mangan ’ s adaptation of ‘ Roseen Dubh ,’ ‘ My Dark Rosaleen ,’ and in Mr. Aubrey de Vere ’ s ‘ The Little Black Rose .’ I do not know any evidence to prove whether this symbol came to Ireland with mediæval Christianity , or whether it has come down from older times . I have read somewhere that a stone engraved with a Celtic god , who holds what looks like a rose in one hand , has been found somewhere in England ; but I cannot find the reference , though I certainly made a note of it . If the Rose was really a symbol of Ireland among the Gaelic poets , and if ‘ Roseen Dubh ’ is really a political poem , as some think , one may feel pretty certain that the ancient Celts associated the Rose with Eire , or Fotla , or Banba — goddesses who gave their names to Ireland — or with some principal god or goddess , for such symbols are not suddenly adopted or invented , but come out of mythology .</p>
    <p n="9">I have made the Seven Lights , the constellation of the Bear , lament for the theft of the Rose , and I have made the Dragon , the constellation Draco , the guardian of the Rose , because these constellations move about the pole of the heavens , the ancient Tree of Life in many countries , and are often associated with the Tree of Life in mythology . It is this Tree of Life that I have put into the ‘ Song of Mongan ’ under its common Irish form of a hazel ; and , because it had sometimes the stars for fruit , I have hung upon it ‘ the Crooked Plough ’ and the ‘ Pilot Star ,’ as Gaelic-speaking Irishmen sometimes call the Bear and the North star . I have made it an axle-tree in ‘ Aedh hears the Cry of the Sedge ,’ for this was another ancient way of representing it .</p>
    <p n="10">THE HOST OF THE AIR ( p. 6 ) .</p>
    <p n="11">Some writers distinguish between the Sluagh Gaoith , the host of the air , and Sluagh Sidhe , the host of the Sidhe , and describe the host of the air as of a peculiar malignancy . Dr. Joyce says , ‘ Of all the different kinds of goblins .... air demons were most dreaded by the people . They lived among clouds , and mists , and rocks , and hated the human race with the utmost malignity .’ A very old Aran charm , which contains the words ‘ Send God , by his strength , between us and the host of the Sidhe , between us and the host of the air ,’ seems also to distinguish among them . I am inclined , however , to think that the distinction came in with Christianity and its belief about the prince of the air , for the host of the Sidhe , as I have already explained , are closely associated with the wind .</p>
    <p n="12">They are said to steal brides just after their marriage , and sometimes in a blast of wind . A man in Galway says , ‘ At Aughanish there were two couples came to the shore to be married , and one of the newly married women was in the boat with the priest , and they going back to the island ; and a sudden blast of wind came , and the priest said some blessed words that were able to save himself , but the girl was swept .’</p>
    <p n="13">This woman was drowned ; but more often the persons who are taken ‘ get the touch ,’ as it is called , and fall into a half dream , and grow indifferent to all things , for their true life has gone out of the world , and is among the hills and the forts of the Sidhe . A faery doctor has told me that his wife ‘ got the touch ’ at her marriage because there was one of them wanted her ; and the way he knew for certain was , that when he took a pitchfork out of the rafters , and told her it was a broom , she said , ‘ It is a broom .’ She was , the truth is , in the magical sleep , to which people have given a new name lately , that makes the imagination so passive that it can be moulded by any voice in any world into any shape . A mere likeness of some old woman , or even old animal , some one or some thing the Sidhe have no longer a use for , is believed to be left instead of the person who is ‘ away ’; this some one or some thing can , it is thought , be driven away by threats , or by violence ( though I have heard country women say that violence is wrong ) , which perhaps awakes the soul out of the magical sleep . The story in the poem is founded on an old Gaelic ballad that was sung and translated for me by a woman at Ballisodare in County Sligo ; but in the ballad the husband found the keeners keening his wife when he got to his house . She was ‘ swept ’ at once ; but the Sidhe are said to value those the most whom they but cast into a half dream , which may last for years , for they need the help of a living person in most of the things they do . There are many stories of people who seem to die and be buried — though the country people will tell you it is but some one or some thing put in their place that dies and is buried — and yet are brought back afterwards . These tales are perhaps memories of true awakenings out of the magical sleep , moulded by the imagination , under the influence of a mystical doctrine which it understands too literally , into the shape of some well-known traditional tale . One does not hear them as one hears the others , from the persons who are ‘ away ,’ or from their wives or husbands ; and one old man , who had often seen the Sidhe , began one of them with ‘ Maybe it is all vanity .’</p>
    <p n="14">Here is a tale that a friend of mine heard in the Burren hills , and it is a type of all :—</p>
    <p n="15">‘ There was a girl to be married , and she didn ’ t like the man , and she cried when the day was coming , and said she wouldn ’ t go along with him . And the mother said , “ Get into the bed , then , and I ’ ll say that you ’ re sick .” And so she did . And when the man came the mother said to him , “ You can ’ t get her , she ’ s sick in the bed .” And he looked in and said , “ That ’ s not my wife that ’ s in the bed , it ’ s some old hag .” And the mother began to cry and roar . And he went out and got two hampers of turf , and made a fire , that they thought he was going to burn the house down . And when the fire was kindled , “ Come out , now ,” says he , “ and we ’ ll see who you are , when I ’ ll put you on the fire .” And when she heard that , she gave one leap , and was out of the house , and they saw , then , it was an old hag she was . Well , the man asked the advice of an old woman , and she bid him go to a faery-bush that was near , and he might get some word of her . So he went there at night , and saw all sorts of grand people , and they in carriages or riding on horses , and among them he could see the girl he came to look for . So he went again to the old woman , and she said , “ If you can get the three bits of blackthorn out of her hair , you ’ ll get her again .” So that night he went again , and that time he only got hold of a bit of her hair . But the old woman told him that was no use , and that he was put back now , and it might be twelve nights before he ’ d get her . But on the fourth night he got the third bit of blackthorn , and he took her , and she came away with him . He never told the mother he had got her ; but one day she saw her at a fair , and , says she , “ That ’ s my daughter ; I know her by the smile and by the laugh of her , and she with a shawl about her head .” So the husband said , “ You ’ re right there , and hard I worked to get her .” She spoke often of the grand things she saw underground , and how she used to have wine to drink , and to drive out in a carriage with four horses every night . And she used to be able to see her husband when he came to look for her , and she was greatly afraid he ’ d get a drop of the wine , for then he would have come underground and never left it again . And she was glad herself to come to earth again , and not to be left there .’</p>
    <p n="16">The old Gaelic literature is full of the appeals of the Tuatha De Danaan to mortals whom they would bring into their country ; but the song of Midher to the beautiful Etain , the wife of the king who was called Echaid the ploughman , is the type of all .</p>
    <p n="17">‘ O beautiful woman , come with me to the marvellous land where one listens to a sweet music , where one has spring flowers in one ’ s hair , where the body is like snow from head to foot , where no one is sad or silent , where teeth are white and eyebrows are black ... cheeks red like foxglove in flower .... Ireland is beautiful , but not so beautiful as the Great Plain I call you to . The beer of Ireland is heady , but the beer of the Great Plain is much more heady . How marvellous is the country I am speaking of ! Youth does not grow old there . Streams with warm flood flow there ; sometimes mead , sometimes wine . Men are charming and without a blot there , and love is not forbidden there . O woman , when you come into my powerful country you will wear a crown of gold upon your head . I will give you the flesh of swine , and you will have beer and milk to drink , O beautiful woman . O beautiful woman , come with me !’</p>
    <p n="18">THE SONG OF WANDERING AENGUS ( p. 11 ) .</p>
    <p n="19">The Tuatha De Danaan can take all shapes , and those that are in the waters take often the shape of fish . A woman of Burren , in Galway , says , ‘ There are more of them in the sea than on the land , and they sometimes try to come over the side of the boat in the form of fishes , for they can take their choice shape .’ At other times they are beautiful women ; and another Galway woman says , ‘ Surely those things are in the sea as well as on land . My father was out fishing one night off Tyrone . And something came beside the boat that had eyes shining like candles . And then a wave came in , and a storm rose all in a minute , and whatever was in the wave , the weight of it had like to sink the boat . And then they saw that it was a woman in the sea that had the shining eyes . So my father went to the priest , and he bid him always to take a drop of holy water and a pinch of salt out in the boat with him , and nothing could harm him .’</p>
    <p n="20">The poem was suggested to me by a Greek folk song ; but the folk belief of Greece is very like that of Ireland , and I certainly thought , when I wrote it , of Ireland , and of the spirits that are in Ireland . An old man who was cutting a quickset hedge near Gort , in Galway , said , only the other day , ‘ One time I was cutting timber over in Inchy , and about eight o ’ clock one morning , when I got there , I saw a girl picking nuts , with her hair hanging down over her shoulders ; brown hair ; and she had a good , clean face , and she was tall , and nothing on her head , and her dress no way gaudy , but simple . And when she felt me coming she gathered herself up , and was gone , as if the earth had swallowed her up . And I followed her , and looked for her , but I never could see her again from that day to this , never again .’</p>
    <p n="21">The county Galway people use the word ‘ clean ’ in its old sense of fresh and comely .</p>
    <p n="22">HE MOURNS FOR THE CHANGE THAT HAS COME UPON HIM AND HIS BELOVED , AND LONGS FOR THE END OF THE WORLD ( p. 15 ) .</p>
    <p n="23">My deer and hound are properly related to the deer and hound that flicker in and out of the various tellings of the Arthurian legends , leading different knights upon adventures , and to the hounds and to the hornless deer at the beginning of , I think , all tellings of Oisin ’ s journey to the country of the young . The hound is certainly related to the Hounds of Annwvyn or of Hades , who are white , and have red ears , and were heard , and are , perhaps , still heard by Welsh peasants , following some flying thing in the night winds ; and is probably related to the hounds that Irish country people believe will awake and seize the souls of the dead if you lament them too loudly or too soon . An old woman told a friend and myself that she saw what she thought were white birds , flying over an enchanted place ; but found , when she got near , that they had dogs ’ heads , and I do not doubt that my hound and these dog-headed birds are of the same family . I got my hound and deer out of a last century Gaelic poem about Oisin ’ s journey to the country of the young . After the hunting of the hornless deer , that leads him to the seashore , and while he is riding over the sea with Niamh , he sees amid the waters — I have not the Gaelic poem by me , and describe it from memory — a young man following a girl who has a golden apple , and afterwards a hound with one red ear following a deer with no horns . This hound and this deer seem plain images of the desire of man ‘ which is for the woman ,’ and ‘ the desire of the woman which is for the desire of the man ,’ and of all desires that are as these . I have read them in this way in ‘ The Wanderings of Usheen ’ or Oisin , and have made my lover sigh because he has seen in their faces ‘ the immortal desire of immortals .’</p>
    <p n="24">The man in my poem who has a hazel wand may have been Aengus , Master of Love ; and I have made the boar without bristles come out of the West , because the place of sunset was in Ireland , as in other countries , a place of symbolic darkness and death .</p>
    <p n="25">THE CAP AND BELLS ( p. 22 ) .</p>
    <p n="26">I dreamed this story exactly as I have written it , and dreamed another long dream after it , trying to make out its meaning , and whether I was to write it in prose or verse . The first dream was more a vision than a dream , for it was beautiful and coherent , and gave me the sense of illumination and exaltation that one gets from visions , while the second dream was confused and meaningless . The poem has always meant a great deal to me , though , as is the way with symbolic poems , it has not always meant quite the same thing . Blake would have said , ‘ the authors are in eternity ,’ and I am quite sure they can only be questioned in dreams .</p>
    <p n="27">THE VALLEY OF THE BLACK PIG ( p. 24 ) .</p>
    <p n="28">All over Ireland there are prophecies of the coming rout of the enemies of Ireland , in a certain Valley of the Black Pig , and these prophecies are , no doubt , now , as they were in the Fenian days , a political force . I have heard of one man who would not give any money to the Land League , because the Battle could not be until the close of the century ; but , as a rule , periods of trouble bring prophecies of its near coming . A few years before my time , an old man who lived at Lisadill , in Sligo , used to fall down in a fit and rave out descriptions of the Battle ; and a man in Sligo has told me that it will be so great a battle that the horses shall go up to their fetlocks in blood , and that their girths , when it is over , will rot from their bellies for lack of a hand to unbuckle them . If one reads Professor Rhys ’ “ Celtic Heathendom ” by the light of Professor Frazer ’ s “ Golden Bough ,” and puts together what one finds there about the boar that killed Diarmuid , and other old Celtic boars and sows , one sees that the battle is mythological , and that the Pig it is named from must be a type of cold and winter doing battle with the summer , or of death battling with life . For the purposes of poetry , at any rate , I think it a symbol of the darkness that will destroy the world . The country people say there is no shape for a spirit to take so dangerous as the shape of a pig ; and a Galway blacksmith — and blacksmiths are thought to be specially protected — says he would be afraid to meet a pig on the road at night ; and another Galway man tells this story : ‘ There was a man coming the road from Gort to Garryland one night , and he had a drop taken ; and before him , on the road , he saw a pig walking ; and having a drop in , he gave a shout , and made a kick at it , and bid it get out of that . And by the time he got home , his arm was swelled from the shoulder to be as big as a bag , and he couldn ’ t use his hand with the pain of it . And his wife brought him , after a few days , to a woman that used to do cures at Rahasane . And on the road all she could do would hardly keep him from lying down to sleep on the grass . And when they got to the woman she knew all that happened ; “ and ,” says she , “ it ’ s well for you that your wife didn ’ t let you fall asleep on the grass , for if you had done that but even for one instant , you ’ d be a lost man .”’</p>
    <p n="29">Professor Rhys , who considers the bristleless boar a symbol of darkness and cold , rather than of winter and cold , thinks it was without bristles because the darkness is shorn away by the sun .</p>
    <p n="30">The Battle should , I believe , be compared with three other battles ; a battle the Sidhe are said to fight when a person is being taken away by them ; a battle they are said to fight in November for the harvest ; the great battle the Tuatha De Danaan fought , according to the Gaelic chroniclers , with the Fomor at Moy Tura , or the Towery Plain .</p>
    <p n="31">I have heard of the battle over the dying both in County Galway and in the Isles of Aran , an old Aran fisherman having told me that it was fought over two of his children , and that he found blood in a box he had for keeping fish , when it was over ; and I have written about it , and given examples elsewhere . A faery doctor , on the borders of Galway and Clare , explained it as a battle between the friends and enemies of the dying , the one party trying to take them , the other trying to save them from being taken . It may once , when the land of the Sidhe was the only other world , and when every man who died was carried thither , have always accompanied death . I suggest that the battle between the Tuatha De Danaan , the powers of light , and warmth , and fruitfulness , and goodness , and the Fomor , the powers of darkness , and cold , and barrenness , and badness upon the Towery Plain , was the establishment of the habitable world , the rout of the ancestral darkness ; that the battle among the Sidhe for the harvest is the annual battle of summer and winter ; that the battle among the Sidhe at a man ’ s death is the battle of life and death ; and that the battle of the Black Pig is the battle between the manifest world and the ancestral darkness at the end of all things ; and that all these battles are one , the battle of all things with shadowy decay . Once a symbolism has possessed the imagination of large numbers of men , it becomes , as I believe , an embodiment of disembodied powers , and repeats itself in dreams and visions , age after age .</p>
    <p n="32">THE SECRET ROSE ( p. 32 ) .</p>
    <p n="33">I find that I have unintentionally changed the old story of Conchubar ’ s death . He did not see the crucifixion in a vision , but was told about it . He had been struck by a ball , made of the dried brain of a dead enemy , and hurled out of a sling ; and this ball had been left in his head , and his head had been mended , the ‘ Book of Leinster ’ says , with thread of gold because his hair was like gold . Keating , a writer of the time of Elizabeth , says , ‘ In that state did he remain seven years , until the Friday on which Christ was crucified , according to some historians ; and when he saw the unusual changes of the creation and the eclipse of the sun and the moon at its full , he asked of Bucrach , a Leinster Druid , who was along with him , what was it that brought that unusual change upon the planets of Heaven and Earth . “ Jesus Christ , the Son of God ,” said the Druid , “ who is now being crucified by the Jews .” “ That is a pity ,” said Conchubar ; “ were I in his presence I would kill those who were putting him to death .” And with that he brought out his sword , and rushed at a woody grove which was convenient to him , and began to cut and fell it ; and what he said was , that if he were among the Jews , that was the usage he would give them , and from the excessiveness of his fury which seized upon him , the ball started out of his head , and some of the brain came after it , and in that way he died . The wood of Lanshraigh , in Feara Rois , is the name by which that shrubby wood is called .’</p>
    <p n="34">I have imagined Cuchulain meeting Fand ‘ walking among flaming dew .’ The story of their love is one of the most beautiful of our old tales .</p>
    <p n="35">I have founded the man ‘ who drove the gods out of their Liss ,’ or fort , upon something I have read about Caolte after the battle of Gabra , when almost all his companions were killed , driving the gods out of their Liss , either at Osraighe , now Ossory , or at Eas Ruaidh , now Asseroe , a waterfall at Ballyshannon , where Ilbreac , one of the children of the goddess Danu , had a Liss . But maybe I only read it in Mr. Standish O ’ Grady , who has a fine imagination , for I find no such story in Lady Gregory ’ s book .</p>
    <p n="36">I have founded ‘ the proud dreaming king ’ upon Fergus , the son of Roigh , the legendary poet of ‘ the quest of the bull of Cuailgne ,’ as he is in the ancient story of Deirdre , and in modern poems by Ferguson . He married Nessa , and Ferguson makes him tell how she took him ‘ captive in a single look .’</p>
    <p n="37">‘ I am but an empty shade , Far from life and passion laid ; Yet does sweet remembrance thrill All my shadowy being still .’</p>
    <p n="38">Presently , because of his great love , he gave up his throne to Conchubar , her son by another , and lived out his days feasting , and fighting , and hunting . His promise never to refuse a feast from a certain comrade , and the mischief that came by his promise , and the vengeance he took afterwards , are a principal theme of the poets . I have explained my changing imaginations of him in ‘ Fergus and the Druid ,’ and in a little song in the second act of ‘ The Countess Kathleen ,’ and in ‘ Deirdre .’</p>
    <p n="39">I have founded him ‘ who sold tillage , and house , and goods ,’ upon something in ‘ The Red Pony ,’ a folk tale in Mr. Larminie ’ s ‘ West Irish Folk Tales .’ A young man ‘ saw a light before him on the high road . When he came as far , there was an open box on the road , and a light coming up out of it . He took up the box . There was a lock of hair in it . Presently he had to go to become the servant of a king for his living . There were eleven boys . When they were going out into the stable at ten o ’ clock , each of them took a light but he . He took no candle at all with him . Each of them went into his own stable . When he went into his stable he opened the box . He left it in a hole in the wall . The light was great . It was twice as much as in the other stables .’ The king hears of it , and makes him show him the box . The king says , ‘ You must go and bring me the woman to whom the hair belongs .’ In the end , the young man , and not the king , marries the woman .</p>
    <p n="40">EARLY POEMS :</p>
    <p n="41">BALLADS AND LYRICS ( p. 89 ) . ‘ THE ROSE ’ ( p. 139 ) . ‘ THE WANDERINGS OF OISIN ’ ( p. 175 ) .</p>
    <p n="42">When I first wrote I went here and there for my subjects as my reading led me , and preferred to all other countries Arcadia and the India of romance , but presently I convinced myself , for such reasons as those in ‘ Ireland and the Arts ,’ that I should never go for the scenery of a poem to any country but my own , and I think that I shall hold to that conviction to the end . I was very young ; and , perhaps because I belonged to a Young Ireland Society in Dublin , I wished to be as easily understood as the Young Ireland writers , to write always out of the common thought of the people .</p>
    <p n="43">I have put the poems written while I was influenced by this desire , though with an always lessening force , into those sections which I have called ‘ Early Poems .’ I read certain of them now with no little discontent , for I find , especially in the ballads , some triviality and sentimentality . Mangan and Davis , at their best , are not sentimental and trivial , but I became so from an imitation that was not natural to me . When I was writing the poems in the second of the three , the section called ‘ The Rose ,’ I found that I was becoming unintelligible to the young men who had been in my thought . We have still the same tradition , but I have been like a traveller who , having when newly arrived in the city noticed nothing but the news of the market-place , the songs of the workmen , the great public buildings , has come after certain months to let his thoughts run upon some little carving in its niche , some Ogham on a stone , or the conversation of a countryman who knows more of the ‘ Boar without Bristles ’ than of the daily paper .</p>
    <p n="44">When writing I went for nearly all my subjects to Irish folklore and legends , much as a Young Ireland poet would have done , writing ‘ Down by the Salley Garden ’ by adding a few lines to a couple of lines I heard sung at Ballisodare ; ‘ The Meditation of the Old Fisherman ’ from the words of a not very old fisherman at Rosses Point ; ‘ The Lamentation of the Old Pensioner ’ from words spoken by a man on the Two Rock Mountain to a friend of mine ; ‘ The Ballad of the Old Foxhunter ’ from an incident in one of Kickham ’ s novels ; and ‘ The Ballad of Moll Magee ’ from a sermon preached in a chapel at Howth ; and ‘ The Wanderings of Oisin ’ from a Gaelic poem of the Eighteenth Century and certain Middle Irish poems in dialogue . It is no longer necessary to say who Oisin and Cuchulain and Fergus and the other bardic persons are , for Lady Gregory , in her ‘ Gods and Fighting Men ’ and ‘ Cuchulain of Muirthemne ’ has re-told all that is greatest in the ancient literature of Ireland in a style that has to my ears an immortal beauty .</p>
