    <p n="2">Arms and the man I sing ,— not as of old The Mantuan bard his mighty verse unrolled , But in such humbler strains as may beseem Light changes rung on a fantastic theme . My tale is ancient , but the sense is new ,— Replete with monstrous fictions , yet half true ;— And , if you 'll follow till the story 's done , I promise much instruction , and some fun .</p>

    <head>CANTO I</head>
    <head>THE GREEN KNIGHT</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">King Arthur and his court were blithe and gay</l>
     <l n="2">In high-towered Camelot , on Christmas day ,</l>
     <l n="3">For all the Table Round were back again ,</l>
     <l n="4">At peace with God and with their fellow-men .</l>
     <l n="5">Their shields hung idly on the pictured wall ;</l>
     <l n="6">Their blood-stained banners decked the festal hall</l>
     <l n="7">Light footsteps , rustling on the rush-strewn floors ,</l>
     <l n="8">And laughter , rippling down long corridors ,</l>
     <l n="9">Attested minds at ease and hearts at play ,—</l>
     <l n="10">Rude Mars unharnessed for love 's holiday .</l>
     <l n="11">In the great hall the Christmas feast was done .</l>
     <l n="12">The level sunbeams from the setting sun</l>
     <l n="13">Stretched through the mullioned casements to the wall ,</l>
     <l n="14">And wove fantastic shadows over all .</l>
     <l n="15">The revelry was hushed . In tranquil ease</l>
     <l n="16">The warriors grouped themselves by twos and threes</l>
     <l n="17">About the dames and damsels of the court ,</l>
     <l n="18">And chattered careless words of small import ;</l>
     <l n="19">But in an alcove , unobserved , apart ,</l>
     <l n="20">Young Gawayne sat with Lady Elfinhart ,</l>
     <l n="21">In Arthur 's court no goodlier knight than he</l>
     <l n="22">Wore shirt of mail , or Cupid 's panoply ;</l>
     <l n="23">And Elfinhart , to Gawayne 's eager eyes .</l>
     <l n="24">Of all heaven 's treasures seemed the goodliest prize .</l>
     <l n="25">Now daylight faded , and the twilight gloom</l>
     <l n="26">Deepened the stillness in the vaulted room ,</l>
     <l n="27">Save where upon the hearth a fitful glow</l>
     <l n="28">Blushed from the embers as the fire burned low .</l>
     <l n="29">There is a certain subtle twilight mood ,</l>
     <l n="30">When two hearts meet in a dim solitude ,</l>
     <l n="31">That thrills the soul e'en to the finger-tips ,</l>
     <l n="32">And brings the heart 's dear secrets to the lips .</l>
     <l n="33">In Gawayne 's corner , as the shades grew thicker ,</l>
     <l n="34">Four eyes waxed brighter , and two pulses quicker ;</l>
     <l n="35">Ten minutes more of quiet talk unbroken ,</l>
     <l n="36">And heaven alone can tell what might be spoken !</l>
     <l n="37">But it was not to be , for fates unequal</l>
     <l n="38">Compelled — but this anticipates the sequel .</l>
     <l n="39">Just in the nick of time , King Arthur rose</l>
     <l n="40">From his sedate post-prandial repose ,</l>
     <l n="41">And called for lights . Along the shadowy aisles</l>
     <l n="42">His pages ’ footsteps pattered o'er the tiles ,</l>
     <l n="43">Speeding to do his errand , and at once</l>
     <l n="44">Four tapers flickered from each silver sconce .</l>
     <l n="45">The scene was changed , the dreamer 's dream dispelled ,</l>
     <l n="46">And what might else have been his fate withheld</l>
     <l n="47">From Gawayne 's grasp . So may one touch of chance</l>
     <l n="48">Shatter the fragile fabric of romance ,</l>
     <l n="49">And all the heart 's desire ,— the joy , the trouble ,—</l>
     <l n="50">Flash to oblivion with the bursting bubble !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="51">But Arthur , on his kingly dais-seat ,</l>
     <l n="52">Felt nothing of the passion and the heat</l>
     <l n="53">That fire young blood . He raised his warlike head</l>
     <l n="54">And glancing moodily around him , said :</l>
     <l n="55">“ So have ye feasted well , my knights , this day ,</l>
     <l n="56">And filled your hearts with revel and with play .</l>
     <l n="57">But to my mind that day is basely spent</l>
     <l n="58">Which passes by without accomplishment</l>
     <l n="59">Of some bright deed of arms or chivalry .</l>
     <l n="60">We rust in indolence . As well not be ,</l>
     <l n="61">As be the minions of an idle court</l>
     <l n="62">Where all is gallantry and girlish sport !</l>
     <l n="63">Some bold adventure let our thoughts devise ,</l>
     <l n="64">To stir our courage and to cheer our eyes . ”</l>
     <l n="65">And lo ! while yet he spoke , from far away</l>
     <l n="66">In the thick shroud of the departed day ,</l>
     <l n="67">Upon the frosty air of evening borne ,</l>
     <l n="68">Came the faint challenge of a fairy horn !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="69">King Arthur started up in mild surprise ,</l>
     <l n="70">While knights and dames looked round with questioning eyes ,</l>
     <l n="71">And each to other spoke some hurried word ,</l>
     <l n="72">As , “ Did you hear it ? ” — “ What was that I heard ? ”</l>
     <l n="73">But well they knew ; for you must understand</l>
     <l n="74">That Camelot lay close to Fairyland ,</l>
     <l n="75">And the wild blast of fairy horns , once known ,</l>
     <l n="76">Is straightway recognized as soon as blown ,</l>
     <l n="77">Being a sound unique , unearthly , shrill ,—</l>
     <l n="78">Between a screech-owl and a whip-poor-will .</l>
     <l n="79">The mischief is , that no one e'er can tell</l>
     <l n="80">Whether such heralding bodes ill or well !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="81">The ladies of the palace looked faint fear ,</l>
     <l n="82">Dreading some perilous adventure near ;</l>
     <l n="83">For peril can the bravest spirits move ,</l>
     <l n="84">When threatening not ourselves , but those we love ;</l>
     <l n="85">But Lady Elfinhart clapped hands in glee ,—</l>
     <l n="86">In sooth , no sentimentalist seemed she ,—</l>
     <l n="87">And cried : “ Now , brave Sir Gawayne ,— O what fun !</l>
     <l n="88">Succor us , save us , else we are undone ;</l>
     <l n="89">Show us the prowess of your arm this night ;</l>
     <l n="90">I never saw a tilt by candle-light ! ”</l>
     <l n="91">Gaily she spoke , and seemed all unconcerned ;</l>
     <l n="92">And yet a curious watcher might have learned</l>
     <l n="93">From a slight quaver in her laughter free</l>
     <l n="94">To doubt the frankness of her flippancy .</l>
     <l n="95">Gawayne , bewildered , looked the other way ,</l>
     <l n="96">And wondered what she meant ; for in that day</l>
     <l n="97">The ready wit of man was under muzzle ,</l>
     <l n="98">And woman 's heart was still an unsolved puzzle ;</l>
     <l n="99">And Gawayne , though in valor next to none ,</l>
     <l n="100">Wished that her heart had been a tenderer one .</l>
     <l n="101">His sword was out for any foe on earth ,</l>
     <l n="102">And yet to face death for a lady 's mirth</l>
     <l n="103">Seemed scarce worth while . What honor bade , he'ld do ,</l>
     <l n="104">But would have liked to see a tear or two .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="105">While thus he pondered , came a sudden burst</l>
     <l n="106">Of high-pitched fairy horn-calls , like the first ,</l>
     <l n="107">But nearer , clearer , deadlier than before ,</l>
     <l n="108">Blown seemingly from just outside the door .</l>
     <l n="109">The casements shook , the taper lights all trembled ;</l>
     <l n="110">The bravest knight 's dismay was ill-dissembled ;</l>
     <l n="111">And as all sprang with one accord to win</l>
     <l n="112">Their swords and shields , stern combat to begin ,</l>
     <l n="113">The great doors shot their bolts , and opened slowly in .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="114">And now my laboring muse is hard beset ,</l>
     <l n="115">For something followed such as never yet</l>
     <l n="116">Was writ or sung , by human voice or hand ,</l>
     <l n="117">Save those that tell old tales from Fairyland .</l>
     <l n="118">“ Miracles do not happen : ” — ‘ t is plain sense ,</l>
     <l n="119">If you italicize the present tense ;</l>
     <l n="120">But in those days , as rare old Chaucer tells ,</l>
     <l n="121">All Britain was fulfilled of miracles .</l>
     <l n="122">So , as I said , the great doors opened wide .</l>
     <l n="123">In rushed a blast of winter from outside ,</l>
     <l n="124">And with it , galloping on the empty air ,</l>
     <l n="125">A great green giant on a great green mare</l>
     <l n="126">Plunged like a tempest-cleaving thunderbolt ,</l>
     <l n="127">And struck four-footed , with an earthquake 's jolt ,</l>
     <l n="128">Plump on the hearthstone . There the uncouth wight</l>
     <l n="129">Sat greenly laughing at the strange affright</l>
     <l n="130">That paled all cheeks and opened wide all eyes ;</l>
     <l n="131">Till after the first shock of quick surprise</l>
     <l n="132">The people circled round him , still in awe ,</l>
     <l n="133">And circling stared ; and this is what they saw :</l>
     <l n="134">Cassock and hood and hose , of plushy sheen</l>
     <l n="135">Like close-cut grass upon a bowling-green ,</l>
     <l n="136">Covered his stature , from his verdant toes</l>
     <l n="137">To the green brows that topped his emerald nose .</l>
     <l n="138">His beard was glossy , like unripened corn ;</l>
     <l n="139">His eyes shot sparklets like the polar morn .</l>
     <l n="140">But like in hue unto that deep-sea green</l>
     <l n="141">Wherewith must shine those gems of ray serene</l>
     <l n="142">The dark , unfathomed caves of ocean bear .</l>
     <l n="143">Green was his raiment , green his monstrous mare .</l>
     <l n="144">He rode unarmed , uncorsleted , unshielded ,</l>
     <l n="145">Except that in his huge right hand he wielded</l>
     <l n="146">A frightful battle-axe , with blade as green</l>
     <l n="147">As coppery rust ;— but the long edge shone keen .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="148">Such was the stranger , and he turned his head</l>
     <l n="149">From one side to the other , and then said ,</l>
     <l n="150">With gentle voice , most like a summer breeze</l>
     <l n="151">That rustles through the leaves of the green trees :</l>
     <l n="152">“ So this is Arthur 's court ! My noble lord ,</l>
     <l n="153">You said just now you felt a trifle bored ,</l>
     <l n="154">And wished , instead of dancing , feasting , flirting ,</l>
     <l n="155">Your gallant warriors might be exerting</l>
     <l n="156">Their puissance upon some worthier thing .</l>
     <l n="157">The wish , my lord , was worthy of a king !</l>
     <l n="158">It pleased me ; here I am ; and I intend</l>
     <l n="159">To serve your fancy as a faithful friend .</l>
     <l n="160">I bring adventure ,— no hard , tedious quest ,</l>
     <l n="161">But merely what I call a merry jest .</l>
     <l n="162">Let some good knight , the doughtiest of you all ,</l>
     <l n="163">Swing this my battle-axe , and let it fall</l>
     <l n="164">On whatsoever part of me he will ;</l>
     <l n="165">I will abide the blow , and hold me still ;</l>
     <l n="166">But let him , just a twelvemonth from this day ,</l>
     <l n="167">Come to me , if by any means he may ,</l>
     <l n="168">And let me , if I live , pay back my best ,</l>
     <l n="169">As he pays me . What think you of the jest ? ”</l>
     <l n="170">He said ; and made a courteous bow ,— the while</l>
     <l n="171">Lighting his features with a bright green smile ;</l>
     <l n="172">As when June breezes , after rain-clouds pass ,</l>
     <l n="173">Ripple in sunlight o'er the unmown grass .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="174">The jest seemed fair indeed ; but none the less</l>
     <l n="175">No knight showed any undue forwardness</l>
     <l n="176">To seize the offer . Some with laughter free</l>
     <l n="177">Daffed it aside ; while others carelessly</l>
     <l n="178">Strolled to the farthest corners of the hall</l>
     <l n="179">As if they had not heard his words at all ,</l>
     <l n="180">And whistled with an air of idle ease ,</l>
     <l n="181">Or studied figures in the tapestries .</l>
     <l n="182">Not so Sir Gawayne . Vexed in mind he stood</l>
     <l n="183">With downcast eyes , and knew not what he would .</l>
     <l n="184">Trained in the school of chivalry to prize</l>
     <l n="185">His honor as the light of his dear eyes ,</l>
     <l n="186">He held his life , his fortunes , everything ,</l>
     <l n="187">In sacred trust for knighthood and his king ,</l>
     <l n="188">And in the battle-field or tilting-yard</l>
     <l n="189">He met his foe full-fronted , and struck hard .</l>
     <l n="190">But now it seemed a foolish thing to throw</l>
     <l n="191">One 's whole life to the fortune of a blow .</l>
     <l n="192">True valor breathes not in the braggart vaunt ;</l>
     <l n="193">True honor takes no shame from idle taunt ;</l>
     <l n="194">So let this wizard , if he wants to , scoff ;</l>
     <l n="195">Why should our hero have his head cut off ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="196">While thus Sir Gawayne , wrapped in thought intense ,</l>
     <l n="197">Debated honor versus common sense ,</l>
     <l n="198">The stranger knight was casting his green glance</l>
     <l n="199">Around the circling throng ,— until by chance</l>
     <l n="200">He met the eyes of Lady Elfinhart ,</l>
     <l n="201">And — did she flush ?— and did the Green Knight start ?</l>
     <l n="202">Surely a quiver twinkled in each eye ;</l>
     <l n="203">But what of that ? It need not signify :</l>
     <l n="204">Beneath his glance a brave man well might flush ;</l>
     <l n="205">What wonder then that a fair maid should blush ?</l>
     <l n="206">And as for him , no man that ever loved</l>
     <l n="207">Could look upon her loveliness unmoved .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="208">Could I but picture her — ah , you would deem</l>
     <l n="209">My tale the figment of a poet 's dream ;</l>
     <l n="210">And if you saw her , ( could such bliss be given ) ,</l>
     <l n="211">You'ld think yourself in dreamland — or in heaven .</l>
     <l n="212">Not the red rapture of new-wakened roses ,</l>
     <l n="213">When morning dew their soul of love uncloses ,</l>
     <l n="214">( Roses that must be wooed ,— nor may be won</l>
     <l n="215">Save by the prince of lovers , the warm sun ) ,</l>
     <l n="216">Not the fair lily , nor the violet shy ,</l>
     <l n="217">Whose heart 's love lurks deep in her still blue eye ,</l>
     <l n="218">Nor any flower , the loveliest and the best ,</l>
     <l n="219">Can image to you half the charm compressed</l>
     <l n="220">In those dear eyes , those lips ,— nay , every part</l>
     <l n="221">That made that sum of witcheries — Elfinhart .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="222">Her face was a dim dream of shadowy light ,</l>
     <l n="223">Like misty moonbeams on the fields of night ,</l>
     <l n="224">And in her voice sweet nature 's sweetest tunes</l>
     <l n="225">Sang the glad song of twenty cloudless Junes .</l>
     <l n="226">Her raiment ,— nay ; go , reader , if you please ,</l>
     <l n="227">To some sage Treatise on Antiquities ,</l>
     <l n="228">Whence writers of historical romances</l>
     <l n="229">Cull old embroideries for their new-spun fancies ;</l>
     <l n="230">I care not for the trivial , nor the fleeting .</l>
     <l n="231">Beneath her dress a woman 's heart was beating</l>
     <l n="232">The rhythm of love 's eternal eloquence ,</l>
     <l n="233">And I confess to you , in confidence ,</l>
     <l n="234">Though flowers have grown a thousand years above her ,</l>
     <l n="235">Unseen , unknown , with all my soul I love her .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="236">From these digressions upon love and glory ,</l>
     <l n="237">‘ Tis time we were returning to our story .</l>
     <l n="238">I only meant , in a few words , to tell you</l>
     <l n="239">( For fear my heroine 's conduct should repel you )</l>
     <l n="240">That if she jests , for instance , out of season ,</l>
     <l n="241">Perhaps there is a good substantial reason .</l>
     <l n="242">Sir Gawayne , had he seen the stranger wink</l>
     <l n="243">And seen the lady blushing , you may think</l>
     <l n="244">Might have been spared a most unhappy lot .</l>
     <l n="245">Perhaps you 're right ;— but peradventure not .</l>
     <l n="246">I give you but a hint , for half the art</l>
     <l n="247">Of narrative is holding back a part ,</l>
     <l n="248">And if without reserve I gave my best</l>
     <l n="249">In the first canto , who would read the rest ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="250">But now Sir Gawayne , with a troubled eye ,</l>
     <l n="251">Looked up , and saw his lady standing by .</l>
     <l n="252">Quoth he : “ And if this conjurer unblest</l>
     <l n="253">Win no acceptance of his bitter jest ,</l>
     <l n="254">How then in after days shall Arthur 's court</l>
     <l n="255">Confront the calumny and foul report</l>
     <l n="256">Of idle tongues ? ” The wrath in Gawayne 's eyes</l>
     <l n="257">Hashed for an instant ; then in humbler wise</l>
     <l n="258">He spoke on : “ Yet God grant I be not blind</l>
     <l n="259">Where honor lights the way ; for to my mind</l>
     <l n="260">True honor bids us shun the devil 's den ,</l>
     <l n="261">To fight God 's battles in the world of men .</l>
     <l n="262">Who takes this challenge up , I doubt will rue it . ”</l>
     <l n="263">Quoth Elfinhart : “ I'ld like to see you do it ! ”</l>
     <l n="264">She laughed a gay laugh , but by hard constraint :</l>
     <l n="265">Then turned and hid her face , all pale and faint ,</l>
     <l n="266">As one might be who stabs and turns the knife</l>
     <l n="267">In the warm heart of one more dear than life .</l>
     <l n="268">She turned and Gawayne saw not ; but he heard ,</l>
     <l n="269">And felt his heart-strings tighten at her word .</l>
     <l n="270">“ Nay , lady , if you wish it I will try ;</l>
     <l n="271">Be your least wish my will , although I die !</l>
     <l n="272">Yet one thing , if I may , I fain would ask ,</l>
     <l n="273">Before I make the venture ;— if this task</l>
     <l n="274">Prove fateful as it threatens ,— do you care ? ”</l>
     <l n="275">“ Perhaps , ” said Elfinhart , “ you do not dare ! ”</l>
     <l n="276">Lightly she laughed , and scoffing tossed her head ,</l>
     <l n="277">Yet spoke as one who knew not what she said ,</l>
     <l n="278">With random words , and with quick-taken breath ;</l>
     <l n="279">Then turned again , ere that same look of death</l>
     <l n="280">Should steal upon her and betray her heart</l>
     <l n="281">Despite all stratagems of woman 's art .</l>
     <l n="282">And Gawayne heard but saw not ; and the night</l>
     <l n="283">Descended on him , and his face grew white</l>
     <l n="284">With grief and passion . When all else is lost ,</l>
     <l n="285">The brave man gives life too , nor counts the cost .</l>
     <l n="286">“ I dreamt , ” he murmured to himself , “ and dreaming</l>
     <l n="287">I took for truth what was but sweetest seeming .</l>
     <l n="288">My waking eyes find naught in life to keep ;</l>
     <l n="289">I take the venture , and so back — to sleep . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="290">By this , the stranger had at last become</l>
     <l n="291">Tired of long waiting , and of sitting dumb</l>
     <l n="292">Upon his charger ; so with greenest leer</l>
     <l n="293">He vented his impatience in a sneer .</l>
     <l n="294">“ Is this , ” he said , “ the glorious Table Round ,</l>
     <l n="295">And is its glory naught but empty sound ?</l>
     <l n="296">Braggarts ! I put your bluster to the test ,</l>
     <l n="297">And find you quail before a merry jest ! ”</l>
     <l n="298">Then the great king himself stood up in ire ,</l>
     <l n="299">With clenched hand raised , and eyes that gleamed dark fire ,</l>
     <l n="300">And fronting the Green Knight he cried : “ Forbear !</l>
     <l n="301">For by my sword Excalibur I swear ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="302">“ Whate'er thou be , thou shalt not carry hence</l>
     <l n="303">Unscathed the memory of thine insolence .</l>
     <l n="304">Such jests as thine please not ; yet even so</l>
     <l n="305">I take thine axe ; kneel thou , and take my blow . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="306">Across the Green Knight 's features there was seen</l>
     <l n="307">To pass a fleeting shade of deeper green ,</l>
     <l n="308">Whether of disappointment or resentment</l>
     <l n="309">None knew ; but straight a smile of bright contentment</l>
     <l n="310">Followed , as through the throng of dazed beholders</l>
     <l n="311">He saw Sir Gawayne thrust his sturdy shoulders .</l>
     <l n="312">The stranger winked at Elfinhart once more ,</l>
     <l n="313">Well pleased , and Gawayne knelt down on the floor .</l>
     <l n="314">“ A boon , ” he cried , “ a boon , my lord and king !</l>
     <l n="315">If ever yet in any little thing</l>
     <l n="316">These hands have served thee , hear my last request :</l>
     <l n="317">Let me adventure this mad monster 's jest ! ”</l>
     <l n="318">King Arthur shook his head in dumb denial ,</l>
     <l n="319">Loth to withdraw his own hand from the trial ,</l>
     <l n="320">And leave the vengeance that himself had vowed ;</l>
     <l n="321">But all the people called to him aloud ,</l>
     <l n="322">“ Sir Gawayne ! let Sir Gawayne strike the blow ! ”</l>
     <l n="323">And Guinevere , the queen , besought him low</l>
     <l n="324">To leave this venture to the lesser man .</l>
     <l n="325">He yielded , and the merry jest began .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="326">The visitor , dismounting , made a bow</l>
     <l n="327">To Arthur , then to all the court . “ And now , ”</l>
     <l n="328">Said he to Gawayne , “ wheresoe'er you choose</l>
     <l n="329">To strike your blow , strike on ; I 'll not refuse ;</l>
     <l n="330">Head , shoulders , chest , or waist , I little reck ;</l>
     <l n="331">Where shall it be ? ” Quoth Gawayne , “ In the neck ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="332">So Gawayne took the axe . The stranger knelt</l>
     <l n="333">Before him on the hearth and loosed his belt ,</l>
     <l n="334">And threw back his green cassock and his hood ,</l>
     <l n="335">To give his foe the fairest mark he could .</l>
     <l n="336">Then thus to Gawayne : “ Ready ! But remember</l>
     <l n="337">To come the twenty-fifth of next December ,</l>
     <l n="338">And take from me the self-same stroke again ! ”</l>
     <l n="339">“ And where , ” asked Gawayne , “ may I find you then ? ”</l>
     <l n="340">“ We 'll speak of that , please , when you 've struck your blow ;</l>
     <l n="341">For if I can n't speak , then you need not go ! ”</l>
     <l n="342">He chuckled softly to himself ; then turned</l>
     <l n="343">And waited for the blow , all unconcerned .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="19">
     <l n="344">Not so the knights and ladies of the court ;</l>
     <l n="345">They pushed and craned their necks to see the sport ;</l>
     <l n="346">Not from the lust of blood , for few expected</l>
     <l n="347">To see blood shed , or the Green Knight dissected ,</l>
     <l n="348">But knowing that some marvel was in store</l>
     <l n="349">Unparalleled in all Arthurian lore ,</l>
     <l n="350">And fairly filled with wide-eyed wonderment .</l>
     <l n="351">But Lady Elfinhart stayed not . She went</l>
     <l n="352">Into the alcove where we saw her first</l>
     <l n="353">And laid her sweet face in her arms , and burst</l>
     <l n="354">Into — but none could tell , unless by peeping ,</l>
     <l n="355">Whether she shook with laughter or with weeping .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="20">
     <l n="356">And Gawayne rubbed his arms , his chest he beat ,</l>
     <l n="357">Then grasped the battle-axe and braced his feet ,</l>
     <l n="358">And swung the ponderous weapon high in air ,</l>
     <l n="359">And brought it down like lightning , fair and square</l>
     <l n="360">Upon the stranger 's neck . The axe flashed through ,</l>
     <l n="361">Cutting the Green Knight cleanly right in two ,</l>
     <l n="362">And split the hard stone floor like kindling wood .</l>
     <l n="363">The head dropped off ; out gushed the thick , hot blood</l>
     <l n="364">Like — I can n't find the simile I want ,</l>
     <l n="365">But let us say a flood of crême de menthe !</l>
     <l n="366">And then the warriors standing round about</l>
     <l n="367">Sent up from fifty throats a mighty shout ,</l>
     <l n="368">As when o'er bloodhYpppHeNsprent fields the long cheers roll</l>
     <l n="369">Cacophonous , for him who kicks a goal .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="21">
     <l n="370">“ O Gawayne ! Well done , Gawayne ! ” they all cried ;</l>
     <l n="371">But straight the tumult and the shouting died ,</l>
     <l n="372">And deadly pallor overspread each face ,</l>
     <l n="373">For the knight 's body stood up in its place</l>
     <l n="374">And stepping nimbly forward seized the head</l>
     <l n="375">That lay still on the hearth-stone , seeming dead ;</l>
     <l n="376">Then vaulted lightly , with a careless air ,</l>
     <l n="377">Back to the saddle of his grass-green mare .</l>
     <l n="378">He held the head up , and behold ! it spoke .</l>
     <l n="379">“ My best congratulations on that stroke ,</l>
     <l n="380">Sir Gawayne ; it was delicately done !</l>
     <l n="381">Our merry little jest is well begun ,</l>
     <l n="382">But look you fail me not this day next year !</l>
     <l n="383">At the Green Chapel by the Murmuring Mere</l>
     <l n="384">I will await you when the sun sinks low ,</l>
     <l n="385">And pay you back full measure , blow for blow ! ”</l>
     <l n="386">He wheeled about , the doors flew wide once more ,</l>
     <l n="387">The mare 's hoofs struck green sparkles from the floor ,</l>
     <l n="388">And with a whirring flash of emerald light</l>
     <l n="389">Both horse and rider vanished in the night .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="22">
     <l n="390">Then all the lords and ladies rubbed their eyes</l>
     <l n="391">And slowly roused themselves from dumb surprise .</l>
     <l n="392">The great hall echoed once more with the clatter</l>
     <l n="393">Of laughing men 's and frightened women 's chatter ;</l>
     <l n="394">But Gawayne , with the axe in hand , stood still ,</l>
     <l n="395">Heedless of what was passing , with no will</l>
     <l n="396">For life or death , for all that made life dear</l>
     <l n="397">Was fled like summer when the leaves fall sere .</l>
     <l n="398">And Arthur spoke , misreading Gawayne 's thought :</l>
     <l n="399">“ Heaven send we have not all too dearly bought</l>
     <l n="400">Our evening 's pastime , Gawayne . You have done</l>
     <l n="401">As fits a fearless knight , and nobly won</l>
     <l n="402">Our thanks in equal measure with our praise .</l>
     <l n="403">Be both remembered in the after days ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="23">
     <l n="404">So spoke the king , and , to confirm his word ,</l>
     <l n="405">From far away in the deep night was heard</l>
     <l n="406">Once more the fairy horn-call , clear and shrill ;</l>
     <l n="407">It died upon the wind , and all was still .</l>
     <l n="408">The hour was late . King Arthur , rising , said</l>
     <l n="409">Good-night to all his court , and went to bed .</l>

    <head>ELFINHART</head>
     <head>CANTO II</head>
    <head>ELFINHART</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">In Canto I. I followed the old rule</l>
     <l n="2">We learned from Horace when we went to school ,</l>
     <l n="3">And took a headlong plunge in medias res ,</l>
     <l n="4">As Maro did , and blind Mæonides ;</l>
     <l n="5">And now , still following the ancient mode ,</l>
     <l n="6">I come to the time-honored “ episode , ”</l>
     <l n="7">Retrace my way some twenty years or more ,</l>
     <l n="8">And tell you what I should have told before .</l>
     <l n="9">It seems an awkward method , but it 's art ;—</l>
     <l n="10">Besides , it brings us back to Elfinhart .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="11">In those dark days before King Arthur came ,</l>
     <l n="12">When Britain was laid waste with sword and flame ,</l>
     <l n="13">When cut-throats lurked behind the blossoming thorn ,</l>
     <l n="14">And young maids cursed the day when they were born ,</l>
     <l n="15">A lady , widowed in one hideous night ,</l>
     <l n="16">Fled over heath and hill , and in her flight</l>
     <l n="17">Came to the magic willow-woods that stand</l>
     <l n="18">Beside the Murmuring Mere , in Fairyland ;</l>
     <l n="19">And there , untimely , by the forest-side ,</l>
     <l n="20">Clasping her infant in her arms , she died .</l>
     <l n="21">Yet not all friendless ,— for such mortal throes</l>
     <l n="22">Pass not unpitied , though no mortal knows ;—</l>
     <l n="23">The spirits that infest the clearer air</l>
     <l n="24">Looked down upon the innocent lady there ,</l>
     <l n="25">While troops of fairies smoothed her mossy bed</l>
     <l n="26">And with sweet balsam pillowed her fair head .</l>
     <l n="27">Her dim eyes could not see them , but she guessed</l>
     <l n="28">Whose gentle ministrations thus had blessed</l>
     <l n="29">Her travail ; and when pitying fairies laid</l>
     <l n="30">Upon her heart the child ,— a blue-eyed maid ,—</l>
     <l n="31">Ere yet her troubled spirit might depart ,</l>
     <l n="32">With one last word she named her “ Elfinhart . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="33">So with new-quickened love the fairy elves</l>
     <l n="34">Took the forlorn child-maiden to themselves</l>
     <l n="35">And reared her in the wildwood , where no jar</l>
     <l n="36">Of alien discord , echoing from afar ,</l>
     <l n="37">Broke the sweet forest murmur , long years round .</l>
     <l n="38">Her ears , attuned to every woodland sound ,</l>
     <l n="39">Translated to her soul the great world 's voice ,</l>
     <l n="40">And the world-spirit made her heart rejoice .</l>
     <l n="41">And love was hers ,— perennial , intense ,—</l>
     <l n="42">The love that wells from joy and innocence</l>
     <l n="43">And sanctifies the cloistered heart of youth ,—</l>
     <l n="44">The love of love , of beauty , and of truth .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="45">So Elfinhart grew up . Each passing year</l>
     <l n="46">Of forest life beside the Murmuring Mere</l>
     <l n="47">Enriched tenfold the natural dower of grace</l>
     <l n="48">That shone from the pure spirit in her face .</l>
     <l n="49">I cannot tell why each revolving season</l>
     <l n="50">Enhanced her beauty thus . Some say the reason</l>
     <l n="51">Was in the stars ; I think those luminaries</l>
     <l n="52">Had less to do with it than had the fairies !</l>
     <l n="53">The more they found of grace in her , the more</l>
     <l n="54">Their silent influence added to her store ;</l>
     <l n="55">For they were always with her ; they and she</l>
     <l n="56">Still bore each other loving company .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="57">And yet one further virtue ,— not the least</l>
     <l n="58">Of those that make life lovable ,— increased</l>
     <l n="59">In Elfinhart 's sweet nature from her birth</l>
     <l n="60">By fairy tutelage ; and that was mirth .</l>
     <l n="61">For fairy natures are compounded all</l>
     <l n="62">Of whimsies and of freaks fantastical ,</l>
     <l n="63">And what the best of fairies loves the best</l>
     <l n="64">( Except pure kindness ) is an artless jest .</l>
     <l n="65">And so wise men have argued , on the whole ,</l>
     <l n="66">That the misguided creatures have no soul ;</l>
     <l n="67">But as for me , if the bright fairy elf</l>
     <l n="68">Has none , I 'll get along without , myself !</l>
     <l n="69">These fairies laughed and danced and sang sweet songs ,</l>
     <l n="70">And did all else that to their craft belongs ,—</l>
     <l n="71">All tricks and pranks of whole-souled jollity</l>
     <l n="72">That make life merry ‘ neath the greenwood tree .</l>
     <l n="73">The youngest of them childishly beguiled</l>
     <l n="74">The time when Elfinhart was still a child ;</l>
     <l n="75">They pinched her fingers , and they pulled her ears ,</l>
     <l n="76">Or sometimes , when her blue eyes dreamed of tears ,</l>
     <l n="77">Half smothered her with showers of four-leafed clover ,—</l>
     <l n="78">Then fled for refuge to some sweet-fern cover ;</l>
     <l n="79">But she pursued them through their tangled lair</l>
     <l n="80">And caught them , and put fire-flies in their hair ;</l>
     <l n="81">And then they all joined hands , and round and round</l>
     <l n="82">They danced a morris on the moonlit ground .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="83">The years went by , and Elfinhart outgrew</l>
     <l n="84">The madcap antics of the younger crew ,</l>
     <l n="85">( For fairies age but slowly : do n't forget</l>
     <l n="86">That at two hundred they are children yet ! )</l>
     <l n="87">But still she frolicked with them , though scarce of them ,</l>
     <l n="88">And learned each year more tenderly to love them .</l>
     <l n="89">But most of all she loved with all her heart</l>
     <l n="90">On quiet summer nights to walk apart</l>
     <l n="91">And hold close converse with the fairies ’ queen ,—</l>
     <l n="92">A radiant maiden princess who had seen</l>
     <l n="93">Some twenty centuries of revolving suns</l>
     <l n="94">Pass over Fairyland ,— all golden ones !</l>
     <l n="95">Sometimes they sat still in the mild moon 's light ,</l>
     <l n="96">Where chestnut blooms made sweet the breath of night ,</l>
     <l n="97">And talked of the great world beyond the wood ,—</l>
     <l n="98">Of death , or sin , or sorrow , understood</l>
     <l n="99">Of neither ,— till the twinkling stars were gone ,</l>
     <l n="100">And bustling Chanticleer proclaimed the dawn .</l>
     <l n="101">And Elfinhart grew wise in fairy learning ;</l>
     <l n="102">But by degrees a half unconscious yearning</l>
     <l n="103">For humankind stirred in her gentle heart ,</l>
     <l n="104">And woke a deep desire to bear her part</l>
     <l n="105">Of love and sorrow in the larger life</l>
     <l n="106">As sister , helper ,— nay , perhaps as wife ;—</l>
     <l n="107">For such vague instincts , after all , are human ,</l>
     <l n="108">And Elfinhart herself was but a woman .</l>
     <l n="109">And yet , for all this new desire , I doubt</l>
     <l n="110">If Elfinhart would e'er have spoken out ,</l>
     <l n="111">And told the fairies of her wish to leave them ,</l>
     <l n="112">( A wish her conscious heart well knew would grieve them ) ,</l>
     <l n="113">If in the ripening of her silent thought</l>
     <l n="114">A still voice had not whispered that she ought</l>
     <l n="115">To leave that world of love and mirth and beauty ,</l>
     <l n="116">To share man 's burden in this world of duty .</l>
     <l n="117">( There 's anticlimax for you ! Most provoking ,</l>
     <l n="118">Just when you thought that I was only joking ,</l>
     <l n="119">Or idly fingering the poet 's laurel ,</l>
     <l n="120">To find my story threatens to be moral !</l>
     <l n="121">But as for morals , though in verse we scout them ,</l>
     <l n="122">In life we somehow can n't get on without them ;</l>
     <l n="123">So if I do n't insert a moral distich</l>
     <l n="124">Once in a while , I can n't be realistic ;—</l>
     <l n="125">And in this tale , I solemnly aver ,</l>
     <l n="126">My one wish is to tell things as they were !</l>
     <l n="127">But not all things ; time flies , and art is long ,</l>
     <l n="128">And I must hurry onward with my song . )</l>
     <l n="129">How Elfinhart at last told what she wanted ,</l>
     <l n="130">And what the fairies said , please take for granted .</l>
     <l n="131">She prayed , they yielded ; Elfinhart full loth</l>
     <l n="132">To leave , as they to let her go , but both</l>
     <l n="133">Agreeing that this bitter thing must be ;</l>
     <l n="134">For they were fairies , and a mortal she .</l>
     <l n="135">But ere they yielded , they made imposition</l>
     <l n="136">Of what then seemed to her a light condition .</l>
     <l n="137">‘ Twas done in kindness , be it understood ,</l>
     <l n="138">With fairy foresight for the maiden 's good .</l>
     <l n="139">The elf-queen spoke for all : “ Dear Elfinhart ,</l>
     <l n="140">We bind you to one promise ere we part .</l>
     <l n="141">We fear naught from men 's malice ; hate and wrath</l>
     <l n="142">And every evil thing will shun your path ,</l>
     <l n="143">And sunshine will go with you when you move ;</l>
     <l n="144">The only danger that we dread is love .</l>
     <l n="145">If in the after days , when suitors woo you ,</l>
     <l n="146">Your heart makes choice of one , as dearest to you ,</l>
     <l n="147">Before you put your hand in his and own</l>
     <l n="148">The sacred trust reserved for him alone ,</l>
     <l n="149">Let us make trial of him , and approve</l>
     <l n="150">His virtue , and his manhood , and his love .</l>
     <l n="151">Send him to us ; and if he bears the test ,</l>
     <l n="152">And if we find him worthy to be blest</l>
     <l n="153">With love like yours , be sure we will befriend him ;</l>
     <l n="154">And may a life-long happiness attend him !</l>
     <l n="155">But if he prove a traitor , or faint-hearted ,</l>
     <l n="156">Or if his love and he are lightly parted ,</l>
     <l n="157">In the deep willow-woods he shall remain ,</l>
     <l n="158">And never look upon your face again ! ”</l>
     <l n="159">The maiden , fancy-free , was well content ,</l>
     <l n="160">And with light laughter gave her full consent ;</l>
     <l n="161">For when maids think of love ( as maidens do )</l>
     <l n="162">It seems a far-off thing ; and well she knew</l>
     <l n="163">Her lover , if she loved , would be both brave and true !</l>
     <l n="164">Not long thereafter came an errant band</l>
     <l n="165">Riding along the edge of Fairyland ,—</l>
     <l n="166">Stout men-at-arms , without reproach or spot ,</l>
     <l n="167">And in the lead the bold Sir Launcelot .</l>
     <l n="168">He , riding on ahead , silent , alone ,</l>
     <l n="169">Was stopped by a beseeching ancient crone</l>
     <l n="170">Who hobbled to his side , as if in pain ,</l>
     <l n="171">And clutched with palsied fingers at his rein .</l>
     <l n="172">And there behind her , from the leafage green ,</l>
     <l n="173">The sweetest eyes his eyes had ever seen</l>
     <l n="174">Were gazing at him with wide wonderment ,</l>
     <l n="175">Nor bold nor fearful ; innocence unshent</l>
     <l n="176">Shone from their blue depths , and old dreams awoke</l>
     <l n="177">In Launcelot 's breast , while thus the beldame spoke :</l>
     <l n="178">“ A boon , a boon , Sir Launcelot of the Lake !</l>
     <l n="179">I Pray you of your courtesy to take</l>
     <l n="180">This damsel to the King . Her enemies</l>
     <l n="181">Have spoiled her of her birthright , and she flees</l>
     <l n="182">An innocent outcast from her wasted lands ,</l>
     <l n="183">To lay her life and fortune in his hands . ”</l>
     <l n="184">She spoke , and vanished in the woodland shade .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="185">Then Launcelot , leaning over helped the maid</l>
     <l n="186">To mount behind and at an easy trot</l>
     <l n="187">They and the troop rode on to Camelot .</l>
     <l n="188">He asked no questions for some fairy spell</l>
     <l n="189">Made light his heart , and told him all was well ;</l>
     <l n="190">And as these two rode through the land together ,</l>
     <l n="191">By dappled greenwood shade and sunlit heather ,</l>
     <l n="192">Her soft voice in his ears , the innocent charm</l>
     <l n="193">Of her light , steady touch upon his arm ,</l>
     <l n="194">Wrought magic in his soul . That day , I ween ,</l>
     <l n="195">Sir Launcelot well-nigh forgot his queen .</l>
     <l n="196">And Elfinhart ( you knew those eyes were hers ! )</l>
     <l n="197">Laughed with the silvery jingle of his spurs ,</l>
     <l n="198">And from her heart the new world 's rapture drove</l>
     <l n="199">All thought of Fairyland — excepting love .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="200">And so to high-towered Camelot they came ,</l>
     <l n="201">The golden city ,— now a shadowy name ;</l>
     <l n="202">For over heath-clad hills the wild-winds blow</l>
     <l n="203">Where Arthur 's halls , a thousand years ago</l>
     <l n="204">Bright with all far-fetched gems of curious art ,</l>
     <l n="205">Shone brighter with the eyes of Elfinhart .</l>
     <l n="206">She came to Camelot ; the king receives her ;</l>
     <l n="207">And there for five glad years my story leaves her .</l>
     <l n="208">Five glad years , and this “ episode ” is done ,</l>
     <l n="209">And we are back again at Canto I .</l>
     <l n="210">I write of merry jest and greenwood shade ,</l>
     <l n="211">But tales of chivalry are not my trade ;</l>
     <l n="212">So if you wish to read that five years ’ story</l>
     <l n="213">Of lady-love , romance , and martial glory ,—</l>
     <l n="214">The mighty feats of arms that Gawayne did ,—</l>
     <l n="215">The ever ripening love that Gawayne hid</l>
     <l n="216">Five long years in his breast , biding his time ,—</l>
     <l n="217">Go seek it in some abler poet 's rime .</l>
     <l n="218">My tale begins with the young knight 's brave soul</l>
     <l n="219">All Elfinhart 's . She thinks herself heart-whole .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="220">But at that Christmas feast , in Arthur 's hall ,</l>
     <l n="221">With night 's soft mantle folded over all ,</l>
     <l n="222">The magic influence of the evening tide</l>
     <l n="223">Stole on their two hearts beating side by side .</l>
     <l n="224">And Gawayne talked of troubles long ago ,</l>
     <l n="225">When each man 's neighbor was his dearest foe ,</l>
     <l n="226">And of the trials he himself had passed ,</l>
     <l n="227">And the high purpose that from first to last</l>
     <l n="228">Had been his stay and spur , he scarce knew how ,</l>
     <l n="229">Since on Excalibur he took the vow .</l>
     <l n="230">He told of his own hopes for future days ,</l>
     <l n="231">And how he wrought and fought not for men 's praise ,</l>
     <l n="232">( Though like all good men Gawayne held that dear ) ,</l>
     <l n="233">Yet trusting , when men laid him on his bier ,</l>
     <l n="234">They might remember , as they gathered round it ,</l>
     <l n="235">“ He left this good world better than he found it . ”</l>
     <l n="236">He talked as true men seldom talk , unless</l>
     <l n="237">Swayed utterly by some pure passion 's stress ,</l>
     <l n="238">And ever gently , though with heart on fire ,</l>
     <l n="239">Still hovered nearer to his soul 's desire .</l>
     <l n="240">And Elfinhart in gravest silence listened ,</l>
     <l n="241">But her sweet heart beat high , her blue eyes glistened ;</l>
     <l n="242">For as he bared his soul to her she dreamed</l>
     <l n="243">A day-dream strange and new , wherein it seemed</l>
     <l n="244">That in that soul 's clear depth she saw her own ,</l>
     <l n="245">And his most secret thought ( till then unknown )</l>
     <l n="246">Seemed hers eternally . He spoke of death ,</l>
     <l n="247">And then her heart shrank , and she drew deep breath .</l>
     <l n="248">Suddenly , ere she understood at all</l>
     <l n="249">What new life dawned before her , came the call</l>
     <l n="250">Of fairy horns ; and so the Green Knight burst</l>
     <l n="251">Upon the scene , as told in Canto First .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="252">One jarring note , the tuneful chords among ,</l>
     <l n="253">May make mad discord of the sweetest song .</l>
     <l n="254">E'en so with dissonant clamor through the breast</l>
     <l n="255">Of Gawayne rang the Green Knight 's merry jest ;</l>
     <l n="256">But what wild meaning must it not impart</l>
     <l n="257">To the vague fears of gentle Elfinhart ?</l>
     <l n="258">For she had heard in the first trumpet-blast</l>
     <l n="259">A signal to her from the far-gone past ;</l>
     <l n="260">And now , of all the strange things that had been ,</l>
     <l n="261">Her half forgotten compact with the queen</l>
     <l n="262">Flushed through her memory , and a swift thought came</l>
     <l n="263">Like sudden fear , a thought without a name ,</l>
     <l n="264">An unvoiced question and a blind alarm ;</l>
     <l n="265">And in sheer helplessness she reached an arm</l>
     <l n="266">Toward Gawayne scarcely knowing what she would ;</l>
     <l n="267">Her eyes beheld him , and she understood .</l>
     <l n="268">And is it Gawayne ? He ? Yes , Elfinhart ,</l>
     <l n="269">The hour has come , and you must play your part .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="270">So now it 's all explained ; and I intend</l>
     <l n="271">To go straight onward to the story 's end .</l>
     <l n="272">Sir Gawayne had cut off the Green Knight 's head ,</l>
     <l n="273">And Arthur and his court had gone to bed ;</l>
     <l n="274">In the great hall the dying embers shone</l>
     <l n="275">With a faint ghostly gleam , and there , alone ,</l>
     <l n="276">While all the rest of Camelot was sleeping ,</l>
     <l n="277">In the dark alcove Elfinhart lay weeping .</l>
     <l n="278">But as she lay there , all about her head</l>
     <l n="279">There fell a checkered beam of moonlight , shed</l>
     <l n="280">Through the barred casement ; and she faintly stirred ,</l>
     <l n="281">For in her troubled soul it seemed she heard</l>
     <l n="282">Vague music from some region far away !</l>
     <l n="283">She raised her head and , turning where she lay ,</l>
     <l n="284">Saw in the silver moonlight the serene</l>
     <l n="285">And tranquil beauty of the fairy queen !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="286">“ We sent before you called us , Elfinhart ,</l>
     <l n="287">For love lent keener magic to our art ,</l>
     <l n="288">And warned us of the thoughts that in your breast</l>
     <l n="289">Awoke new rapture , trembling unconfessed . ”</l>
     <l n="290">And Elfinhart moved closer to her knees</l>
     <l n="291">And hid her face in the white draperies</l>
     <l n="292">That veiled the fairy form , till , nestling there ,</l>
     <l n="293">Her heart recovered from that blank despair ,</l>
     <l n="294">And whispered her that whatsoe'er befell</l>
     <l n="295">Love ruled the world , and all would yet be well .</l>
     <l n="296">And the good fairy stroked the maiden 's head</l>
     <l n="297">And kissed her tear-starred eyes , and smiling said :</l>
     <l n="298">“ Fie on you women 's hearts ! Consistency</l>
     <l n="299">Hides her shamed head where mortal women be !</l>
     <l n="300">True love breeds faith and trust , it makes hearts strong ;</l>
     <l n="301">The heart 's anointed king can do no wrong !</l>
     <l n="302">And yet you weep as if you feared to prove him ;—</l>
     <l n="303">Upon my word , I do n't believe you love him ! ”</l>
     <l n="304">And Elfinhart replied : “ Laugh if you will ,</l>
     <l n="305">My queen , but let me be a woman still .</l>
     <l n="306">You fairies love where love is wise and just ;</l>
     <l n="307">We mortal women love because we must :</l>
     <l n="308">And if I feared to prove him , I confess</l>
     <l n="309">I fear I still must love him none the less . ”</l>
     <l n="310">She paused , for once again her eyes grew dim :</l>
     <l n="311">“ Think you I love his virtues ? I love him !</l>
     <l n="312">But yet you judged me wrongly , for believe me ,</l>
     <l n="313">( And then laugh once again , and so forgive me ) ,</l>
     <l n="314">If at the first I feared what you might do ,</l>
     <l n="315">My doubts were not of Gawayne , but of you ! ”</l>
     <l n="316">And so both laughed , and for a little space</l>
     <l n="317">Folded each other in a glad embrace ;</l>
     <l n="318">( For fairies , bathed the whole year round in bliss ,</l>
     <l n="319">May yet be gladdened by a fair maid 's kiss ) ;</l>
     <l n="320">And Elfinhart spoke on : “ Do what you will ,</l>
     <l n="321">I trust you with my all , and fear no ill .</l>
     <l n="322">But oh , my friend , to wait the long , long year ,—</l>
     <l n="323">To keep my heart in silence , not to hear</l>
     <l n="324">The words my whole soul hungers for , nor say</l>
     <l n="325">One syllable to brighten his dark day !</l>
     <l n="326">Must it be so , my queen ? And how shall I</l>
     <l n="327">School eyes and lips to act this year-long lie ?</l>
     <l n="328">From the dear teacher-guardian of my youth</l>
     <l n="329">The only ways I learned were ways of truth !</l>
     <l n="330">I tried my skill this night , and learned to know</l>
     <l n="331">That there are deeps below the deeps of woe ;</l>
     <l n="332">Hearts may be bruised and broken , yet still live ;—</l>
     <l n="333">The wounds that kill us are the wounds we give ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="334">And so these two talked on , until the night</l>
     <l n="335">Began to shiver with the gray dawn 's light ,</l>
     <l n="336">And in the deep-dyed casement they might see</l>
     <l n="337">New life flush through old dreams of chivalry .</l>
     <l n="338">And then they parted . What the queen had said</l>
     <l n="339">I know not , but the lady , comforted ,</l>
     <l n="340">Bade farewell with calm voice and tranquil eyes ,</l>
     <l n="341">And saw with new-born strength the new sun rise .</l>
     <l n="342">Perhaps in Fairyland there chanced to be</l>
     <l n="343">For them that grieve some sovereign alchemy</l>
     <l n="344">To turn the worst to best , and the good queen</l>
     <l n="345">Applied this soothing balm . Such things have been ;</l>
     <l n="346">But yet I doubt if any fairy art</l>
     <l n="347">Was needed in the case of Elfinhart ;</l>
     <l n="348">The medicine that charmed away her dole</l>
     <l n="349">Nature had planted in her own sweet soul .</l>
     <l n="350">Of all sure things , this thing I 'm surest of ,—</l>
     <l n="351">That the best cure for love 's own ills is love .</l>

      <l n="391">Might Gawayne 's lips then utter , but he heard</l>
      <l n="392">The voice that was his music , and could feel</l>
      <l n="393">The touch of gentle fingers through the steel .</l>
      <l n="394">“ Wear this , Sir Gawayne , for a loyal friend</l>
      <l n="395">Whose hopes and prayers go with you to the end . ”</l>
      <l n="396">And , staying not for answer , she withdrew ,</l>
      <l n="397">And in the throng was lost to Gawayne 's view .</l>
      <l n="398">He roused himself , and waving high his hand ,</l>
      <l n="399">Struck spur , and so rode off toward Fairyland .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="16">
      <l n="400">Long time he traveled by an unknown way ,</l>
      <l n="401">Unhoused at night , companionless by day .</l>
      <l n="402">The cold sleet stung him through his shirt of mail ,</l>
      <l n="403">But , underneath , his stout heart would not fail ,</l>
      <l n="404">But beat full measure through the fiercest storm ,</l>
      <l n="405">And kept his head clear and his brave soul warm .</l>
      <l n="406">No need to tell the perils that he passed ;</l>
      <l n="407">He conquered all , and came unscathed at last</l>
      <l n="408">To where a high-embattled castle stood</l>
      <l n="409">Deep in the heart of a dense willow-wood .</l>
      <l n="410">And Gawayne called aloud , and to the gate</l>
      <l n="411">A smiling porter came , who opened straight ,</l>
      <l n="412">And bade him enter in and take his rest ;</l>
      <l n="413">And Gawayne entered , and the people pressed</l>
      <l n="414">About him with fair speeches ; and he laid</l>
      <l n="415">His armor off , and gave it them , and prayed</l>
      <l n="416">That they would take his message to their lord ,—</l>
      <l n="417">prayer for friendly shelter , bed and board .</l>
      <l n="418">He told them whence he was , his birth and name ;</l>
      <l n="419">And the bold baron of the castle came ,</l>
      <l n="420">A mighty man , huge-limbed , with flashing eyes ,</l>
      <l n="421">And welcomed him with old-time courtesies ;</l>
      <l n="422">For manners , in those days , were held of worth ,</l>
      <l n="423">And gentle breeding went with gentle birth .</l>
      <l n="424">He heartily was glad his guest had come ,</l>
      <l n="425">And made Sir Gawayne feel himself at home ;</l>
      <l n="426">And as they walked in , side by side , each knew</l>
      <l n="427">The other for an honest man and true .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="17">
      <l n="428">That night our hero and the baron ate</l>
      <l n="429">A sumptuous dinner in the hall of state ,</l>
      <l n="430">And all the household , ranged along the board ,</l>
      <l n="431">Made good cheer with Sir Gawayne and their lord ,</l>
      <l n="432">And passed the brimming bowl right merrily</l>
      <l n="433">With friendly banter and quick repartee .</l>
      <l n="434">And Gawayne asked if they had chanced to hear</l>
      <l n="435">Of a Green Chapel by a Murmuring Mere ,</l>
      <l n="436">And straightway all grew grave . Within his breast</l>
      <l n="437">Sir Gawayne felt a tremor of unrest ,</l>
      <l n="438">But told his story with a gay outside ,</l>
      <l n="439">And asked for some good man to be his guide</l>
      <l n="440">To find his foe . “ I promise him , ” said he ,</l>
      <l n="441">“ No golden guerdon ;— his reward shall be</l>
      <l n="442">The consciousness that unto him ‘ t was given</l>
      <l n="443">To show a parting soul the way to heaven ! ”</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="18">
      <l n="444">Up jumped his host . “ My friend , I like your attitude ,</l>
      <l n="445">And know no surer way to win heaven 's gratitude</l>
      <l n="446">Than sending thither just such men as you ;</l>
      <l n="447">I 'll be your guide . But since you are not due</l>
      <l n="448">At the Green Chapel till three nights from now ,</l>
      <l n="449">And since the way is short , I 'll tell you how</l>
      <l n="450">The interim may be disposed of best :—</l>
      <l n="451">In short , let me propose a merry jest ! ”</l>
      <l n="452">At this Sir Gawayne gave a sudden start ,</l>
      <l n="453">For some old memory seemed to clutch his heart ,</l>
      <l n="454">And in the baron 's eyes he seemed to see</l>
      <l n="455">A twinkling gleam of green benignity</l>
      <l n="456">Not wholly strange ; but like a flash ‘ t was gone .</l>
      <l n="457">Gawayne sank back , and his good host went on :</l>
      <l n="458">“ Two days you sojourn here , and while I take</l>
      <l n="459">My daily hunting in the wood , you make</l>
      <l n="460">My house and castle yours ; and then , each night ,</l>
      <l n="461">We 'll meet together here at candle-light ,</l>
      <l n="462">And all my winnings in the wood , and all</l>
      <l n="463">That comes to you at home , whate'er befall ,</l>
      <l n="464">We 'll give each other in exchange ; in fine ,</l>
      <l n="465">My fortune shall be yours , and yours be mine . ”</l>
      <l n="466">To Gawayne this seemed generous indeed .</l>
      <l n="467">And with most cordial laughter he agreed .</l>
      <l n="468">They clasped hands o'er the bargain with good zest ,</l>
      <l n="469">And then all said good-night , and went to rest .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="19">
      <l n="470">Next morning Gawayne was awakened early</l>
      <l n="471">From a deep slumber by the hurly-burly</l>
      <l n="472">Of footman , horseman , seneschal , and groom ,</l>
      <l n="473">Bustling beneath the windows of his room .</l>
      <l n="474">He rose and looked out , just in time to see</l>
      <l n="475">The baron and a goodly company</l>
      <l n="476">Of huntsmen , armed with cross-bow , axe , and spear ,</l>
      <l n="477">Ride through the castle gate and disappear .</l>
      <l n="478">And then , while Gawayne dressed , there came a knock</l>
      <l n="479">Upon his chamber door . He threw the lock ,</l>
      <l n="480">And a boy page brought robes of ermine fur</l>
      <l n="481">And Tarsic silk ,— black , white , and lavender ,—</l>
      <l n="482">For his array , and with them a kind message ,</l>
      <l n="483">Which the good knight received with no ill presage :</l>
      <l n="484">“ Will brave Sir Gawayne spare an idle hour</l>
      <l n="485">For quiet converse in my lady 's bower ? ”</l>
      <l n="486">The boy led on , and Gawayne followed him</l>
      <l n="487">Through crooked corridors and archways dim ,</l>
      <l n="488">Along low galleries echoing from afar ,</l>
      <l n="489">And down a winding stair ; then “ Here we are ! ”</l>
      <l n="490">The page cried cheerily , and paused before</l>
      <l n="491">The massive carvings of an antique door .</l>
      <l n="492">This he swung open ; and the knight passed through</l>
      <l n="493">Into a garden , fresh with summer dew !</l>
      <l n="494">A lady 's bower in Fairyland ! What pen</l>
      <l n="495">Could make that strange enchantment live again ?</l>
      <l n="496">Not he who drew Acrasia 's Bower of Bliss</l>
      <l n="497">And Phædria 's happy isle could picture this .</l>
      <l n="498">That sweet-souled Puritan discerned too well</l>
      <l n="499">The serpent 's coil behind the witch 's spell ;</l>
      <l n="500">And he who saw — when the dark veil was torn —</l>
      <l n="501">The rose of Paradise without the thorn ,</l>
      <l n="502">( Sublimest prophet , whose immortal verse</l>

      <l n="504">Even he too sternly , in the soul 's defense ,</l>
      <l n="505">Repressed the still importunate cries of sense .</l>
      <l n="506">Bid me not , therefore , task my feebler pen</l>
      <l n="507">With dreams beyond the limits of their ken ;</l>
      <l n="508">The phantom conjurings of the magic hour</l>
      <l n="509">That Gawayne passed in that enchanted bower</l>

      <l n="511">But yet some part of what he felt and did</l>
      <l n="512">These lines must needs disclose . As he stood there ,</l>
      <l n="513">Breathing soft odors from the mellow air ,</l>
      <l n="514">All hopes , all aims of noble knighthood seemed</l>
      <l n="515">Like the dim yesterdays of one who dreamed ,</l>
      <l n="516">In starless caves of memory sunken deep ,</l>
      <l n="517">And , like lost music , folded in strange sleep .</l>
     </lg>

      <l n="534">Such thoughts as these , confused and unexpressed ,</l>
      <l n="535">Flooded the silence in Sir Gawayne 's breast .</l>
      <l n="536">Meanwhile a brasier filled the scented air</l>
      <l n="537">With wreaths of magic mist , and he was ware</l>
      <l n="538">That the mist drew together like a shroud ;</l>
      <l n="539">And then the veil was rent , and in the cloud</l>
      <l n="540">Stood one who seemed , in features , form , and dress ,</l>

      <l n="558">And all that earth holds else , or heaven above ,</l>
      <l n="559">Seemed naught worth keeping , save this dream of love .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="23">
      <l n="560">And now , as the strange cloud of incense broke ,</l>
      <l n="561">The vision , if it were a vision , spoke ,—</l>
      <l n="562">If it were speech that filled the quivering air</l>

      <l n="586">All earth , all heaven , all knightly hopes of grace ,</l>

      <l n="663">And Gawayne looked along the room askance ,</l>
      <l n="664">Seeking the lady ; and he caught one glance</l>
      <l n="665">Of laughing eyes — then looked away in haste ,</l>
      <l n="666">But turned again , and wondered why his taste</l>
      <l n="667">Had erred so strangely , for the lady seemed</l>
      <l n="668">Not fairer now than others . Had he dreamed ?</l>
      <l n="669">He rubbed his eyes and pondered ,— though in sooth</l>
      <l n="670">Without one glimmering presage of the truth ,—</l>
      <l n="671">Till all passed lightly from his puzzled mind ,</l>
      <l n="672">Leaving contentment and good cheer behind .</l>
      <l n="673">So all the company feasted well , and sped</l>
      <l n="674">The flying hours , till it was time for bed .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="29">
      <l n="675">One whole day longer must our hero rest</l>
      <l n="676">Within doors , to fulfill the merry jest .</l>
      <l n="677">So when , next morning , Gawayne once more heard</l>
      <l n="678">The hunt'shYpppHeNup in the court , he never stirred ,</l>
      <l n="679">But let the merry horsemen ride away</l>
      <l n="680">While he slept soundly well into the day .</l>
      <l n="681">Later he rose , and strolled from room to room ,</l>
      <l n="682">Through vaulted twilights of ancestral gloom ,</l>
      <l n="683">Until , descending a long stair , he found</l>
      <l n="684">The dim-lit castle crypt , deep under ground ,</l>
      <l n="685">Where sculptured effigies forever kept</l>
      <l n="686">Their long last marble silence as they slept ,</l>
      <l n="687">And iron sentinels , on bended knees ,</l>
      <l n="688">Held eyeless vigil in old panoplies .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="30">
      <l n="689">Sir Gawayne , wandering on in aimless mood ,</l>
      <l n="690">Pondered the tomb-stone legends , quaint and rude ,</l>
      <l n="691">Wherein the pensive dreamer might divine</l>
      <l n="692">A tragic history in every line ;</l>
      <l n="693">For so does fate , with bitterest irony ,</l>
      <l n="694">Epitomize fame 's immortality ,</l>
      <l n="695">Perpetuating for all after days</l>
      <l n="696">Mute lamentations and unnoted praise .</l>
      <l n="697">And Gawayne , reading here and there the story</l>
      <l n="698">Of fame obscure and unremembered glory ,</l>
      <l n="699">Found on a tablet these words : “ Where he lies ,</l>
      <l n="700">The gray wave breaks and the wild sea-mew flies :</l>
      <l n="701">If any be that loved him , seek not here ,</l>
      <l n="702">But in the lone hills by the Murmuring Mere . ”</l>
      <l n="703">A nameless cenotaph !— perhaps of one</l>
      <l n="704">Like Gawayne 's self deluded and undone</l>
      <l n="705">By the green stranger ; and the legend brought</l>
      <l n="706">A tide of passion flooding Gawayne 's thought ;</l>
      <l n="707">A flood-tide , not of fear ,— for Gawayne 's breast</l>
      <l n="708">Shrank never at the perilous behest</l>
      <l n="709">Of noble knighthood ,— but the love of life ,</l>
      <l n="710">Compassion , and soul-sickness of the strife .</l>
      <l n="711">“ If any be that loved him ! ” Oh , to die</l>
      <l n="712">Far from green-swarded Camelot , and lie</l>
      <l n="713">Among these bleak and barren hills alone ,</l>
      <l n="714">His end unwept for and his grave unknown ,—</l>
      <l n="715">Never again to see the glad sunrise</l>
      <l n="716">That brightened all his world in those dear eyes !</l>

     <lg type="stanza" n="31">
      <l n="717">Half suffocating in the charneled air</l>
      <l n="718">Of that low vault , he staggered up the stair ,</l>
      <l n="719">Out of the dim-lit halls of silent death</l>
      <l n="720">Into the living light , and drew quick breath</l>
      <l n="721">Where , through a casement-arch of ivied stone ,</l>
      <l n="722">Bright from the clear blue sky the warm sun shone .</l>

     <lg type="stanza" n="32">
      <l n="727">Low-voiced she spoke , as if with studied care</l>

      <l n="736">For the dear face I nevermore shall see . ”</l>
      <l n="737">“ Nay , lady , ” said the knight , “ I have no gifts</l>
      <l n="738">To give you . Errant knighthood ever drifts</l>
      <l n="739">From shore to shore , by wandering breezes blown ,</l>
      <l n="740">With naught save its good name to call its own .</l>

     <lg type="stanza" n="33">
      <l n="753">She held a plain green girdle in her hand ,</l>
      <l n="754">In outward seeming just a narrow band</l>
      <l n="755">Of silk , with silver clasps ; but in those days</l>
      <l n="756">The strangest things were wrought in simplest ways ,</l>
      <l n="757">As Gawayne knew full well ; and he could see</l>
      <l n="758">That all the lady said was verity .</l>
      <l n="759">He took the girdle , held it , fingered it ,</l>
      <l n="760">Then clasped it round his waist to try the fit ,</l>
      <l n="761">Irresolutely dallying with temptation ,</l>
      <l n="762">Till conscience grew too weak for inclination ;</l>
      <l n="763">For at the last he threw one wandering glance</l>

      <l n="765">Of sparkling sunbeams on the fields of snow</l>
      <l n="766">Wrought havoc in his wavering heart ; and so ,</l>
      <l n="767">Repeating to himself one word : “ Life , life ! ”</l>

      <l n="769">That evening , when the baron and our knight</l>

    <head>CONCLUSION</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">By noon the next day , Gawayne and his host</l>
     <l n="2">Rode side by side along the perilous coast</l>
     <l n="3">Of the gray Mere , from whose unquiet sleep</l>
     <l n="4">Reverberating murmurs of the deep</l>
     <l n="5">Startled the still December 's listening air .</l>
     <l n="6">The baron , shuddering , pointed seaward . “ There , ”</l>
     <l n="7">He said , “ year in , year out , these voices haunt</l>
     <l n="8">That fearful water ; heaven knows what they want !</l>
     <l n="9">Men tell me — and I have no doubt it 's true —</l>
     <l n="10">They are knights-errant whom the Green Knight slew !</l>
     <l n="11">Woe unto him , the over-bold , who dares</l>
     <l n="12">Adventure near that uncouth monster 's snares ! ”</l>
     <l n="13">Quoth Gawayne : “ How have you escaped the net ? ”</l>
     <l n="14">The baron answered : “ I ? We never met !</l>
     <l n="15">When I 'm about , he seems to shun the place ,</l>
     <l n="16">And where he is , I never show my face ;</l>
     <l n="17">But if we did meet , ‘ t would be safe to say</l>
     <l n="18">Not more than one of us would get away ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="19">And then the baron told tales by the score</l>
     <l n="20">About the Green Knight 's quenchless thirst for gore ,</l>
     <l n="21">And kept repeating that no magic charm</l>
     <l n="22">Was proof against the prowess of his arm ;</l>
     <l n="23">At his first blow each vain defense must fall ,</l>
     <l n="24">For he was arch-magician over all .</l>
     <l n="25">And as from tale to tale the baron ran ,</l>
     <l n="26">Sir Gawayne , had he been another man ,</l>
     <l n="27">Would certainly have felt his heart 's blood curdle ,</l>
     <l n="28">Despite his secret wearing of the girdle ;</l>
     <l n="29">But when the baron finally suggested</l>
     <l n="30">Abandoning the venture , and protested</l>
     <l n="31">That the whole monstrous business was absurd ,</l>
     <l n="32">Sir Gawayne simply said : “ I gave my word . ”</l>
     <l n="33">And when the baron saw he would not bend ,</l>
     <l n="34">He seemed to lose all patience . “ Well , my friend ,</l>
     <l n="35">I 'll go no further with you . On your head</l>
     <l n="36">Shall be your own mad blood when you are dead .</l>
     <l n="37">Yonder your two roads fork ; pause there , I pray ,</l>
     <l n="38">And ponder well before you choose your way .</l>
     <l n="39">One takes the hills , one winds along the wave ;</l>
     <l n="40">To Camelot this ,— the other to your grave !</l>
     <l n="41">Choose the high road , Sir Gawayne ; shun the danger !</l>
     <l n="42">Say you were misdirected by a stranger ;—</l>
     <l n="43">I swear by all that 's sacred , I 'll not tell</l>
     <l n="44">One syllable to a soul :— and so farewell ! ”</l>
     <l n="45">He galloped off without another word ,</l>
     <l n="46">And vanished where the road turned . Gawayne heard ,</l>
     <l n="47">Long after he had disappeared , the sound</l>
     <l n="48">Of iron hoof-beats on the frozen ground ,</l>
     <l n="49">Till all died into silence , save those drear</l>
     <l n="50">And hollow voices from the Murmuring Mere .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="51">But Gawayne chose the lower road , and passed</l>
     <l n="52">Along the desolate shore . The die was cast .</l>
     <l n="53">The western skies , as the red sun sank low ,</l>
     <l n="54">Cast purple shades across the drifted snow ,</l>
     <l n="55">And Gawayne knew that the dread hour was come</l>
     <l n="56">For the fulfillment of his martyrdom .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="57">And now , from just beyond a jutting hill ,</l>
     <l n="58">Came hideous sounds , as of a giant mill</l>
     <l n="59">That hisses , roars , and sputters , clicks and clacks ;—</l>
     <l n="60">It was the Green Knight sharpening his axe !</l>
     <l n="61">And Gawayne , coming past the corner , found him ,</l>
     <l n="62">With ghastly mouldering skulls and bones strewn round him ,</l>
     <l n="63">In joyous fury urging the keen steel</l>
     <l n="64">Against the surface of his grinding wheel .</l>
     <l n="65">The place was a wild hollow , circled round</l>
     <l n="66">With barren hills , and on the bottom ground</l>
     <l n="67">Stood the Green Chapel , moss-grown , solitary ;—</l>
     <l n="68">In sooth , it seemed the devil 's mortuary !</l>
     <l n="69">The Green Knight 's back was turned , and he stirred not</l>
     <l n="70">Till Gawayne hailed him sharply ; then he shot</l>
     <l n="71">One glance — as when , o'erhead , a living wire</l>
     <l n="72">Startles the night with flashes of green fire ;—</l>
     <l n="73">Then hurried forward , bland as bland could be ,</l>
     <l n="74">And greeted Gawayne with green courtesy .</l>
     <l n="75">“ Dear sir , I ask a thousand pardons ; pray</l>
     <l n="76">Forgive me . You are punctual to the day ;</l>
     <l n="77">That 's good ! Of course I knew you would not fail .</l>
     <l n="78">How do you do ? You look a trifle pale ;</l>
     <l n="79">I trust , with all my heart , you are not ill ?</l>
     <l n="80">Just the cold air ? It does blow rather chill !</l>
     <l n="81">What can I do to cheer you ? Let me see ;—</l>
     <l n="82">Suppose I brew a cup of hot green tea ?</l>
     <l n="83">You'ld rather not ? You 're pressed for time ? Of course ,</l>
     <l n="84">I understand ; then just get off your horse ,</l>
     <l n="85">And I 'll do all I can to expedite</l>
     <l n="86">Our little business for you . There , that 's right ;</l>
     <l n="87">And now your helmet ? Thanks ; and if you please</l>
     <l n="88">Perhaps you 'll kindly kneel down on your knees ,</l>
     <l n="89">As I did when I came to Camelot ; So !</l>
     <l n="90">Are you all ready ? Will you bide the blow ? ”</l>
     <l n="91">And Gawayne said “ I will , ” in such soft notes</l>
     <l n="92">As happy bridegrooms utter , when their throats</l>
     <l n="93">Are paralyzed with blest anticipation ;—</l>
     <l n="94">( What Gawayne looked for was decapitation ! )</l>
     <l n="95">And then the Green Knight swung his axe in air</l>
     <l n="96">With a loud whirr ; and Gawayne , kneeling there ,</l>
     <l n="97">Shrank back an inch ; and the green giant stayed</l>
     <l n="98">His threatening hand , and with a cold sneer said :</l>
     <l n="99">“ You shrink , sir , from the axe ; I can n't hit true</l>
     <l n="100">Unless you hold still , as I did for you . ”</l>
     <l n="101">“ Your pardon , ” Gawayne said , with bated breath ;</l>
     <l n="102">“ This time I swear to hold as still as death . ”</l>
     <l n="103">He did so , and the Green Knight swung again</l>
     <l n="104">His axe , and whirled it round his head , and then ,</l>
     <l n="105">Pausing a second time , said : “ Very good !</l>
     <l n="106">You 're holding quite still now ; I knew you would ! ”</l>
     <l n="107">Gawayne , in anger , said : “ Jest , if you like ,</l>
     <l n="108">After the blow ; tarry no longer ; strike ! ”</l>
     <l n="109">So once again the ponderous axe was raised ;</l>
     <l n="110">But this time down it came , and lightly grazed</l>
     <l n="111">Sir Gawayne 's neck . He felt the hot blood flow ,</l>
     <l n="112">And saw red drops that sank deep in the snow ,</l>
     <l n="113">And then he jumped up , faced his foe , and cried :</l>
     <l n="114">“ Enough : you owed me one blow , though I died ;</l>
     <l n="115">But be you man or beast or devil abhorred ,</l>
     <l n="116">I yield no further ; with my mortal sword</l>
     <l n="117">I do defy you ; and if mortal man</l>
     <l n="118">May hope against ” ...</l>
     <l n="119">But the Green Knight began</l>
     <l n="120">A low melodious laugh , like running brooks</l>
     <l n="121">Whose pebbly babble fills the shadowy nooks</l>
     <l n="122">Of green-aisled woodlands , when the winds are still .</l>
     <l n="123">“ My friend , we bear each other no ill will .</l>
     <l n="124">When first I swung my axe , you showed some fear ;</l>
     <l n="125">I owed you that much for your blow last year .</l>
     <l n="126">The second time I swung ,— yet spared your life ,—</l>
     <l n="127">That paid you for the kiss you gave my wife ! ”</l>
     <l n="128">“ Your wife ! ” “ My wife , Sir Gawayne ; ‘ t was my word ;</l>
     <l n="129">And when I swung my weapon for the third</l>
     <l n="130">And last time , then I made the red blood spirt</l>
     <l n="131">For that green girdle underneath your shirt !</l>
     <l n="132">You played me false , my friend ! ”</l>
     <l n="133">And Gawayne knelt</l>
     <l n="134">Once more , and casting off the magic belt ,</l>
     <l n="135">In bitter broken words confessed his shame ,</l>
     <l n="136">And begged the Green Knight to avenge the name</l>
     <l n="137">Of injured knighthood , and with one last blow</l>
     <l n="138">To end his guilty life . “ Nay , nay , not so , ”</l>
     <l n="139">The other softly said . “ Be of good cheer ;</l>
     <l n="140">Your fault was small , for all men hold life dear .</l>
     <l n="141">We tempted you , my friend , with all our might ,</l>
     <l n="142">And proved you in good sooth a noble knight ;</l>
     <l n="143">A veritable Joseph , sir , you are ! ”</l>
     <l n="144">Quoth Gawayne drily , “ Thanks , Lord Potiphar !</l>
     <l n="145">But may I ask you why you played this part ? ”</l>
     <l n="146">The other said : “ Ask Lady Elfinhart ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="147">He smiled , and from his smile a genial glow</l>
     <l n="148">Of green mid-summer seemed to overflow ,</l>
     <l n="149">Filling with verdure all that barren place .</l>
     <l n="150">The warm red blood rushed to Sir Gawayne 's face ;</l>
     <l n="151">He caught his breath , and in his eager eyes</l>
     <l n="152">There shone a sudden flash of dark surmise ,</l>
     <l n="153">And then he stood a long while pondering ;</l>
     <l n="154">But in his breast his heart began to sing</l>
     <l n="155">The old , old music whose still echoes roll</l>
     <l n="156">Forever voiceless through the listening soul .</l>
     <l n="157">He said farewell to his good fairy friend</l>
     <l n="158">As in a dream , where real and unreal blend</l>
     <l n="159">In phantom unison , and with the light</l>
     <l n="160">Of love to lead him home , rode through the night ,</l>
     <l n="161">Beside the tranquil murmurs of the Mere ,</l>
     <l n="162">And through the silence of the passing year ;</l>
     <l n="163">And earth and sea and starlit sky took part</l>
     <l n="164">In the still exaltation of his heart ,</l>
     <l n="165">While all but love and wonder was forgot ,</l>
     <l n="166">Until he came to high-towered Camelot .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="167">To Camelot he came , and there he found</l>
     <l n="168">The good King Arthur and his Table Round</l>
     <l n="169">Awaiting his return in anxious doubt ;</l>
     <l n="170">But ere he passed the gates a mighty shout</l>
     <l n="171">Rose from the watchmen on the outward wall</l>
     <l n="172">And bore the tidings to the inmost hall .</l>
     <l n="173">From every window flaunting flags were flung ;</l>
     <l n="174">From the high battlements brass trumpets sung ;</l>
     <l n="175">And great bells , chiming in the topmost tower ,</l>
     <l n="176">Pealed salutation to the joyous hour ,</l>
     <l n="177">As Gawayne , riding through the cullis-port ,</l>
     <l n="178">Faced the glad throng that filled the palace court .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="179">And with this tribute paid to knightly glory</l>
     <l n="180">It seems most fitting to conclude my story .</l>
     <l n="181">Entreat me not , dear reader , to impart</l>
     <l n="182">Further of Gawayne , or of Elfinhart .</l>
     <l n="183">Let your own fancy round the story out</l>
     <l n="184">Whatever way you please ; I cannot doubt</l>
     <l n="185">The sequel ; but when I , in silent thought ,</l>
     <l n="186">Had brought Sir Gawayne back to her , and sought</l>
     <l n="187">With hand profane to lift the veil , behind</l>
     <l n="188">Whose secret shelter their two hearts enshrined</l>
     <l n="189">The mutual covenant of love 's mystery ,</l>
     <l n="190">That pure fane would not desecrated be .</l>
     <l n="191">But this alone I know : the power that wove</l>
     <l n="192">Through human lives the warp and woof of love</l>
     <l n="193">Wrought not in darkness , nor with hand unsure ;—</l>
     <l n="194">His fabric must forevermore endure .</l>
     <l n="195">And hence I doubt not that these two were blest</l>
     <l n="196">As none may be , save they who have confessed</l>
     <l n="197">Allegiance to that mighty spirit 's law ,</l>
     <l n="198">And trod his holy ground with reverent awe .</l>
