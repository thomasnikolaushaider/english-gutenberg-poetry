     <l n="2">Long ago Apollo called to Aristaeus , youngest</l>
     <l n="3">of the shepherds ,</l>
     <l n="4">Saying , “ I will make you keeper of my bees . ”</l>
     <l n="5">Golden were the hives , and golden was the honey ;</l>
     <l n="6">golden , too , the music ,</l>
     <l n="7">Where the honey-makers hummed among the trees .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="8">Happy Aristaeus loitered in the garden , wandered</l>
     <l n="9">in the orchard ,</l>
     <l n="10">Careless and contented , indolent and free ;</l>
     <l n="11">Lightly took his labour , lightly took his pleasure ,</l>
     <l n="12">till the fated moment</l>
     <l n="13">When across his pathway came Eurydice .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="14">Then her eyes enkindled burning love within him ;</l>
     <l n="15">drove him wild with longing ,</l>
     <l n="16">For the perfect sweetness of her flower-like face ;</l>
     <l n="17">Eagerly he followed , while she fled before him ,</l>
     <l n="18">over mead and mountain ,</l>
     <l n="19">On through field and forest , in a breathless</l>
     <l n="20">race .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="21">But the nymph , in flying , trod upon a serpent ;</l>
     <l n="22">like a dream she vanished ;</l>
     <l n="23">Pluto 's chariot bore her down among the dead ;</l>
     <l n="24">Lonely Aristaeus , sadly home returning , found his</l>
     <l n="25">garden empty ,</l>
     <l n="26">All the hives deserted , all the music fled .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="27">Mournfully bewailing ,— “ ah , my honey-makers ,</l>
     <l n="28">where have you departed ? ” —</l>
     <l n="29">Far and wide he sought them , over sea and shore ;</l>
     <l n="30">Foolish is the tale that says he ever found them ,</l>
     <l n="31">brought them home in triumph ,—</l>
     <l n="32">Joys that once escape us fly for evermore .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="33">Yet I dream that somewhere , clad in downy</l>
     <l n="34">whiteness , dwell the honey-makers ,</l>
     <l n="35">In aerial gardens that no mortal sees :</l>
     <l n="36">And at times returning , lo , they flutter round us ,</l>
     <l n="37">gathering mystic harvest ,—</l>
     <l n="38">So I weave the legend of the long-lost bees .</l>

      <l n="22">Deep in the clouds that veil the sun ,</l>
      <l n="23">Look how the first of the swarm arrive ;</l>
      <l n="24">Timidly venturing , one by one ,</l>
      <l n="25">Down through the tranquil air ,</l>
      <l n="26">Wavering here and there ,</l>

      <l n="28">Caught by a lift of the breeze ,</l>
      <l n="29">Tangled among the naked trees ,—</l>
      <l n="30">Dropping then , without a sound ,</l>
      <l n="31">Feather-white , feather-light ,</l>

      <l n="38">Down the vistas dim and grey ,</l>
      <l n="39">Multitudes are on the way .</l>
      <l n="40">Now a sudden brightness</l>
      <l n="41">Dawns within the sombre day ,</l>
      <l n="42">Over fields of whiteness ;</l>
      <l n="43">And the sky is swiftly alive</l>
      <l n="44">With the flutter and the flight</l>

     <l n="1">Listen , my beloved , while the silver morning ,</l>
     <l n="2">like a tranquil vision ,</l>
     <l n="3">Fills the world around us and our hearts with</l>
     <l n="4">peace ;</l>
     <l n="5">Quiet is the close of Aristaeus ’ legend , happy is</l>
     <l n="6">the ending —</l>
     <l n="7">Listen while I tell you how he found release .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="8">Many months he wandered far away in sadness ,</l>
     <l n="9">desolately thinking</l>
     <l n="10">Only of the vanished joys he could not find ;</l>
     <l n="11">Till the great Apollo , pitying his shepherd , loosed</l>
     <l n="12">him from the burden</l>
     <l n="13">Of a dark , reluctant , backward-looking mind .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="14">Then he saw around him all the changeful beauty</l>
     <l n="15">of the changing seasons ,</l>
     <l n="16">In the world-wide regions where his journey</l>
     <l n="17">lay ;</l>
     <l n="18">Birds that sang to cheer him , flowers that bloomed</l>
     <l n="19">beside him , stars that shone to guide him ,—</l>
     <l n="20">Traveller 's joy was plenty all along the way !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="21">Everywhere he journeyed strangers made him</l>
     <l n="22">welcome , listened while he taught them</l>
     <l n="23">Secret lore of field and forest he had learned :</l>
     <l n="24">How to train the vines and make the olives fruit-</l>
     <l n="25">ful ; how to guard the sheepfolds ;</l>
     <l n="26">How to stay the fever when the dog-star burned .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="27">Friendliness and blessing followed in his foot-</l>
     <l n="28">steps ; richer were the harvests ,</l>
     <l n="29">Happier the dwellings , wheresoe'er he came ;</l>
     <l n="30">Little children loved him , and he left behind him ,</l>
     <l n="31">in the hour of parting ,</l>
     <l n="32">Memories of kindness and a god-like name .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="33">So he travelled onward , desolate no longer ,</l>
     <l n="34">patient in his seeking ,</l>
     <l n="35">Reaping all the wayside comfort of his quest ;</l>
     <l n="36">Till at last in Thracia , high upon Mount Haemus ,</l>
     <l n="37">far from human dwelling ,</l>
     <l n="38">Weary Aristaeus laid him down to rest .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="39">Then the honey-makers , clad in downy whiteness ,</l>
     <l n="40">fluttered soft around him ,</l>
     <l n="41">Wrapt him in a dreamful slumber pure and</l>
     <l n="42">deep .</l>
     <l n="43">This is life , beloved : first a sheltered garden ,</l>
     <l n="44">then a troubled journey ,</l>
     <l n="45">Joy and pain of seeking ,— and at last we sleep !</l>

      <l n="1">The other night I had a dream , most clear</l>
      <l n="2">And comforting , complete</l>
      <l n="3">In every line , a crystal sphere ,</l>
      <l n="4">And full of intimate and secret cheer .</l>
      <l n="5">Therefore I will repeat</l>
      <l n="6">That vision , dearest heart , to you ,</l>

      <l n="11">The shadows flecked the elm-embowered street</l>
      <l n="12">I knew so well , long , long ago ;</l>
      <l n="13">And on the pillared porch where Marguerite</l>
      <l n="14">Had sat with me , the moonlight lay like snow .</l>
      <l n="15">But she , my comrade and my friend of youth ,</l>
      <l n="16">Most gaily wise ,</l>
      <l n="17">Most innocently loved ,—</l>
      <l n="18">She of the blue-grey eyes</l>
      <l n="19">That ever smiled and ever spoke the truth ,—</l>
      <l n="20">From that familiar dwelling , where she moved</l>
      <l n="21">Like mirth incarnate in the years before ,</l>
      <l n="22">Had gone into the hidden house of Death .</l>
      <l n="23">I thought the garden wore</l>
      <l n="24">White mourning for her blessed innocence ,</l>
      <l n="25">And the syringa 's breath</l>
      <l n="26">Came from the corner by the fence ,</l>
      <l n="27">Where she had made her rustic seat ,</l>
      <l n="28">With fragrance passionate , intense ,</l>
      <l n="29">As if it breathed a sigh for Marguerite .</l>
      <l n="30">My heart was heavy with a sense</l>
      <l n="31">Of something good forever gone . I sought</l>
      <l n="32">Vainly for some consoling thought ,</l>
      <l n="33">Some comfortable word that I could say</l>
      <l n="34">To the sad father , whom I visited again</l>
      <l n="35">For the first time since she had gone away .</l>
      <l n="36">The bell rang shrill and lonely ,— then</l>
      <l n="37">The door was opened , and I sent my name</l>
      <l n="38">To him ,— but ah ! ‘ t was Marguerite who came !</l>
      <l n="39">There in the dear old dusky room she stood</l>
      <l n="40">Beneath the lamp , just as she used to stand ,</l>
      <l n="41">In tender mocking mood .</l>
      <l n="42">“ You did not ask for me , ” she said ,</l>
      <l n="43">“ And so I will not let you take my hand ;</l>

   <p>Oh , London is a man 's town , there 's power in the air ; And Paris is a woman 's town , with flowers in her hair ; And it 's sweet to dream in Venice , and it 's great to study Rome ; But when it comes to living there is no place like home .</p>
   <p>I like the German fir-woods , in green battalions drilled ; I like the gardens of Versailles with flashing fountains filled ; But , oh , to take your hand , my dear , and ramble for a day In the friendly western woodland where Nature has her way !</p>

    <head>THE ANCESTRAL DWELLINGS</head>
    <head>Dear to my heart are the ancestral dwellings of America , Dearer than if they were haunted by ghosts of royal splendour ; These are the homes that were built by the brave beginners of a nation , They are simple enough to be great , and full of a friendly dignity .</head>
     <l n="1">I love the old white farmhouses nestled in New</l>
     <l n="2">England valleys ,</l>
     <l n="3">Ample and long and low , with elm-trees feather-</l>
     <l n="4">ing over them :</l>
     <l n="5">Borders of box in the yard , and lilacs , and old-</l>
     <l n="6">fashioned flowers ,</l>
     <l n="7">A fan-light above the door , and little square panes</l>
     <l n="8">in the windows ,</l>
     <l n="9">The wood-shed piled with maple and birch and</l>
     <l n="10">hickory ready for winter ,</l>
     <l n="11">The gambrel-roof with its garret crowded with</l>
     <l n="12">household relics ,—</l>
     <l n="13">All the tokens of prudent thrift and the spirit of</l>
     <l n="14">self-reliance .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>I love the look of the shingled houses that front the ocean ; Their backs are bowed , and their lichened sides are weather-beaten ; Soft in their colour as grey pearls , they are full of patience and courage . They seem to grow out of the rocks , there is something indomitable about them : Pacing the briny wind in a lonely land they stand undaunted , While the thin blue line of smoke from the square-built chimney rises , Telling of shelter for man , with room for a hearth and a cradle .</p>
   <p>I love the stately southern mansions with their tall white columns , They look through avenues of trees , over fields where the cotton is growing ; I can see the flutter of white frocks along their shady porches , Music and laughter float from the windows , the yards are full of hounds and horses . They have all ridden away , yet the houses have not forgotten , They are proud of their name and place , and their doors are always open , For the thing they remember best is the pride of their ancient hospitality .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">In the towns I love the discreet and tranquil</l>
     <l n="2">Quaker dwellings ,</l>
     <l n="3">With their demure brick faces and immaculate</l>
     <l n="4">white-stone doorsteps ;</l>
     <l n="5">And the gabled houses of the Dutch , with their</l>
     <l n="6">high stoops and iron railings ,</l>
     <l n="7">( I can see their little brass knobs shining in the</l>
     <l n="8">morning sunlight ) ;</l>
     <l n="9">And the solid houses of the descendants of the</l>
     <l n="10">Puritans ,</l>
     <l n="11">Fronting the street with their narrow doors and</l>
     <l n="12">dormer-windows ;</l>
     <l n="13">And the triple-galleried , many-pillared mansions</l>
     <l n="14">of Charleston ,</l>
     <l n="15">Standing sideways in their gardens full of roses</l>
     <l n="16">and magnolias .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Yes , they are all dear to my heart , and in my eyes they are beautiful ; For under their roofs were nourished the thoughts that have made the nation ; The glory and strength of America came from her ancestral dwellings .</p>

   <p>IN PRAISE OF POETS</p>
   <p>MOTHER EARTH</p>
   <p>Mother of all the high-strung poets and singers departed , Mother of all the grass that weaves over their graves the glory of the field , Mother of all the manifold forms of life , deep - bosomed , patient , impassive , Silent brooder and nurse of lyrical joys and sor - rows ! Out of thee , yea , surely out of the fertile depth below thy breast , Issued in some Strange way , thou lying motion - less , voiceless , All these songs of nature , rhythmical , passionate , yearning , Coming in music from earth , but not unto earth returning .</p>
   <p>Dust are the blood-red hearts that beat in time to these measures , Thou hast taken them back to thyself , secretly , irresistibly Drawing the crimson currents of life down , down , down Deep into thy bosom again , as a river is lost in the sand .</p>
   <p>But the souls of the singers have entered into the songs that revealed them ,— Passionate songs , immortal songs of joy and grief and love and longing : Floating from heart to heart of thy children , they echo above thee : Do they not utter thy heart , the voices of those that love thee ?</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Long hadst thou lain like a queen transformed by</l>
     <l n="2">some old enchantment</l>
     <l n="3">Into an alien shape , mysterious , beautiful , speech-</l>

     <l n="7">Working within thee awakened the man-child to</l>

    <head>LONGFELLOW</head>
     <l n="1">In a great land , a new land , a land full of labour</l>
     <l n="2">and riches and confusion ,</l>
     <l n="3">Where there were many running to and fro , and</l>
     <l n="4">shouting , and striving together ,</l>
     <l n="5">In the midst of the hurry and the troubled noise ,</l>
     <l n="6">I heard the voice of one singing .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>“ What are you doing there , O man , singing quietly amid all this tumult ? This is the time for new inventions , mighty shoutings , and blowings of the trumpet . ” But he answered , “ I am only shepherding my sheep with music . ”</p>
   <p>So he went along his chosen way , keeping his little flock around him ; And he paused to listen , now and then , beside the antique fountains , Where the faces of forgotten gods were refreshed with musically falling waters ;</p>
   <p>Or he sat for a while at the blacksmith 's door , and heard the cling-clang of the anvils ; Or he rested beneath old steeples full of bells , that showered their chimes upon him ; Or he walked along the border of the sea , drink - ing in the long roar of the billows ;</p>
   <p>Or he sunned himself in the pine-scented ship - yard , amid the tattoo of the mallets ; Or he leaned on the rail of the bridge , letting his thoughts flow with the whispering river ; He hearkened also to ancient tales , and made them young again with his singing .</p>
   <p>Then a flaming arrow of death fell on his flock , and pierced the heart of his dearest ! Silent the music now , as the shepherd entered the mystical temple of sorrow : Long he tarried in darkness there : but when he came out he was singing .</p>
   <p>And I saw the faces of men and women and children silently turning toward him ; The youth setting out on the journey of life , and the old man waiting beside the last mile-stone ; The toiler sweating beneath his load ; and the happy mother rocking her cradle ;</p>
   <p>The lonely sailor on far-off seas ; and the grey - minded scholar in his book-room ; The mill-hand bound to a clacking machine ; and the hunter in the forest ; And the solitary soul hiding friendless in the wilderness of the city ;</p>
   <p>Many human faces , full of care and longing , were drawn irresistibly toward him , By the charm of something known to every heart , yet very strange and lovely , And at the sound of that singing wonderfully all their faces were lightened .</p>
   <p>“ Why do you listen , O you people , to this old and world-worn music ? This is not for you , in the splendour of a new age , in the democratic triumph ! Listen to the clashing cymbals , the big drums , the brazen trumpets of your poets . ”</p>
   <p>But the people made no answer , following in their hearts the simpler music : For it seemed to them , noise-weary , nothing could be better worth the hearing Than the melodies which brought sweet order into life 's confusion .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">So the shepherd sang his way along , until he</l>
     <l n="2">came unto a mountain :</l>
     <l n="3">And I know not surely whether it was called</l>
     <l n="4">Parnassus ,</l>
     <l n="5">But he climbed it out of sight , and still I heard</l>
     <l n="6">the voice of one singing .</l>

     <l n="1">( In memory of Theodore Thomas , 1905 )</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Glory of architect , glory of painter , and sculp - tor , and bard , Living forever in temple and picture and statue and song ,— Look how the world with the lights that they lit is illumined and starred , Brief was the flame of their life , but the lamps of their art burn long !</p>
   <p>Where is the Master of Music , and how has he vanished away ? Where is the work that he wrought with his wonderful art in the air ? Gone ,— it is gone like the glow on the cloud at the close of the day ! The Master has finished his work , and the glory of music is — where ?</p>
   <p>Once , at the wave of his wand , all the billows of musical sound Followed his will , as the sea was ruled by the prophet of old : Now that his hand is relaxed , and his rod has dropped to the ground , Silent and dark are the shores where the mar - vellous harmonies rolled !</p>
   <p>Nay , but not silent the hearts that were filled by that life-giving sea ; Deeper and purer forever the tides of their being will roll , Grateful and joyful , O Master , because they have listened to thee ,— The glory of music endures in the depths of the human soul .</p>

   <p>FIRE-FLY CITY</p>
   <p>Like a long arrow through the dark the train is darting , Bearing me far away , after a perfect day of love 's delight : Wakeful with all the sad-sweet memories of parting , I lift the narrow window-shade and look out on the night .</p>
   <p>Lonely the land unknown , and like a river flow - ing , Forest and field and hill are gliding backward still athwart my dream ; Till in that country strange , and ever stranger growing , A magic city full of lights begins to glow and gleam .</p>
   <p>Wide through the landscape dim the lamps are lit in millions ; Long avenues unfold clear-shining lines of gold across the green ; Clusters and rings of light , and luminous pa - vilions ,— Oh , who will tell the city 's name , and what these wonders mean ?</p>
   <p>Why do they beckon me , and what have they to show me ? Crowds in the blazing street , mirth where the feasters meet , kisses and wine : Many to laugh with me , but never one to know me : A cityful of stranger-hearts and none to beat with mine !</p>
   <p>Look how the glittering lines are wavering and lifting ,— Softly the breeze of night , scatters the vision bright : and , passing fair , Over the meadow-grass and through the forest drifting , The Fire-Fly City of the Dark is lost in empty air !</p>
   <p>Girl of the golden eyes , to you my heart is turning : Sleep in your quiet room , while through the midnight gloom my train is whirled . Clear in your dreams of me the light of love is burning ,— The only never failing light in all the phantom world .</p>

     <l n="57">More easy on the thwarts . And John , my son ,</l>
     <l n="58">My little shipmate , come and lean your head</l>
     <l n="59">Against your father 's knee . Do you recall</l>
     <l n="60">That April morn in Ethelburga 's church ,</l>
     <l n="61">Five years ago , when side by side we kneeled</l>
     <l n="62">To take the sacrament with all our men ,</l>
     <l n="63">Before the Hopewell left St. Catherine 's docks</l>
     <l n="64">On our first voyage ? It was then I vowed</l>
     <l n="65">My sailor-soul and years to search the sea</l>
     <l n="66">Until we found the water-path that leads</l>
     <l n="67">From Europe into Asia .</l>
     <l n="68">I believe</l>
     <l n="69">That God has poured the ocean round His world ,</l>
     <l n="70">Not to divide , but to unite the lands .</l>
     <l n="71">And all the English captains that have dared</l>
     <l n="72">In little ships to plough uncharted waves ,—</l>
     <l n="73">Davis and Drake , Hawkins and Frobisher ,</l>
     <l n="74">Raleigh and Gilbert ,— all the other names ,—</l>
     <l n="75">Are written in the chivalry of God</l>
     <l n="76">As men who served His purpose . I would claim</l>
     <l n="77">A place among that knighthood of the sea ;</l>
     <l n="78">And I have earned it , though my quest should</l>
     <l n="79">fail !</l>
     <l n="80">For , mark me well , the honour of our life</l>
     <l n="81">Derives from this : to have a certain aim</l>
     <l n="82">Before us always , which our will must seek</l>
     <l n="83">Amid the peril of uncertain ways .</l>
     <l n="84">Then , though we miss the goal , our search is</l>
     <l n="85">crowned</l>
     <l n="86">With courage , and we find along our path</l>
     <l n="87">A rich reward of unexpected things .</l>
     <l n="88">Press towards the aim : take fortune as it fares !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="89">I know not why , but something in my heart</l>
     <l n="90">Has always whispered , “ Westward seek your</l>
     <l n="91">goal ! ”</l>
     <l n="92">Three times they sent me east , but still I turned</l>
     <l n="93">The bowsprit west , and felt among the floes</l>
     <l n="94">Of ruttling ice along the Groneland coast ,</l>
     <l n="95">And down the rugged shore of Newfoundland ,</l>
     <l n="96">And past the rocky capes and wooded bays</l>
     <l n="97">Where Gosnold sailed ,— like one who feels his</l>
     <l n="98">way</l>
     <l n="99">With outstretched hand across a darkened</l>
     <l n="100">room ,—</l>
     <l n="101">I groped among the inlets and the isles ,</l>
     <l n="102">To find the passage to the Land of Spice .</l>
     <l n="103">I have not found it yet ,— but I have found</l>
     <l n="104">Things worth the finding !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="105">Son , have you forgot</l>
     <l n="106">Those mellow autumn days , two years ago ,</l>
     <l n="107">When first we sent our little ship Half-Moon ,—</l>
     <l n="108">The flag of Holland floating at her peak ,—</l>
     <l n="109">Across a sandy bar , and sounded in</l>
     <l n="110">Among the channels , to a goodly bay</l>
     <l n="111">Where all the navies of the world could ride ?</l>
     <l n="112">A fertile island that the redmen called</l>
     <l n="113">Manhattan , lay above the bay : the land</l>
     <l n="114">Around was bountiful and friendly fair .</l>
     <l n="115">But never land was fair enough to hold</l>
     <l n="116">The seaman from the calling of the sea .</l>
     <l n="117">And so we bore to westward of the isle ,</l>
     <l n="118">Along a mighty inlet , where the tide</l>
     <l n="119">Was troubled by a downward-flowing flood</l>
     <l n="120">That seemed to come from far away ,— perhaps</l>
     <l n="121">From some mysterious gulf of Tartary ?</l>
     <l n="122">Inland we held our course ; by palisades</l>
     <l n="123">Of naked rock where giants might have built</l>
     <l n="124">Their fortress ; and by rolling hills adorned</l>
     <l n="125">With forests rich in timber for great ships ;</l>
     <l n="126">Through narrows where the mountains shut us in</l>
     <l n="127">With frowning cliffs that seemed to bar the</l>
     <l n="128">stream ;</l>
     <l n="129">And then through open reaches where the banks</l>
     <l n="130">Sloped to the water gently , with their fields</l>
     <l n="131">Of corn and lentils smiling in the sun .</l>
     <l n="132">Ten days we voyaged through that placid land ,</l>
     <l n="133">Until we came to shoals , and sent a boat</l>
     <l n="134">Upstream to find ,— what I already knew ,—</l>
     <l n="135">We travelled on a river , not a strait .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="136">But what a river ! God has never poured</l>
     <l n="137">A stream more royal through a land more rich .</l>
     <l n="138">Even now I see it flowing in my dream ,</l>
     <l n="139">While coming ages people it with men</l>
     <l n="140">Of manhood equal to the river 's pride .</l>
     <l n="141">I see the wigwams of the redmen changed</l>
     <l n="142">To ample houses , and the tiny plots</l>
     <l n="143">Of maize and green tobacco broadened out</l>
     <l n="144">To prosperous farms , that spread o'er hill and</l>
     <l n="145">dale</l>
     <l n="146">The many-coloured mantle of their crops ;</l>
     <l n="147">I see the terraced vineyard on the slope</l>
     <l n="148">Where now the fox-grape loops its tangled vine ;</l>
     <l n="149">And cattle feeding where the red deer roam ;</l>
     <l n="150">And wild-bees gathered into busy hives ,</l>
     <l n="151">To store the silver comb with golden sweet ;</l>
     <l n="152">And all the promised land begins to flow</l>
     <l n="153">With milk and honey . Stately manors rise</l>
     <l n="154">Along the banks , and castles top the hills ,</l>
     <l n="155">And little villages grow populous with trade ,</l>
     <l n="156">Until the river runs as proudly as the Rhine ,—</l>
     <l n="157">The thread that links a hundred towns and</l>
     <l n="158">towers !</l>
     <l n="159">And looking deeper in my dream , I see</l>
     <l n="160">A mighty city covering the isle</l>
     <l n="161">They call Manhattan , equal in her state</l>
     <l n="162">To all the older capitals of earth ,—</l>
     <l n="163">The gateway city of a golden world ,—</l>
     <l n="164">A city girt with masts , and crowned with spires ,</l>
     <l n="165">And swarming with a host of busy men ,</l>
     <l n="166">While to her open door across the bay</l>
     <l n="167">The ships of all the nations flock like doves .</l>
     <l n="168">My name will be remembered there , for men</l>
     <l n="169">Will say , “ This river and this isle were found</l>
     <l n="170">By Henry Hudson , on his way to seek</l>
     <l n="171">The Northwest Passage into Farthest Inde . ”</l>
     <l n="172">Yes ! yes ! I sought it then , I seek it still ,—</l>
     <l n="173">My great adventure and my guiding star !</l>
     <l n="174">For look ye , friends , our voyage is not done ;</l>
     <l n="175">We hold by hope as long as life endures !</l>
     <l n="176">Somewhere among these floating fields of ice ,</l>
     <l n="177">Somewhere along this westward widening bay ,</l>
     <l n="178">Somewhere beneath this luminous northern night ,</l>
     <l n="179">The channel opens to the Orient ,—</l>
     <l n="180">I know it ,— and some day a little ship</l>
     <l n="181">Will push her bowsprit in , and battle through !</l>
     <l n="182">And why not ours ,— to-morrow ,— who can tell ?</l>
     <l n="183">The lucky chance awaits the fearless heart !</l>
     <l n="184">These are the longest days of all the year ;</l>
     <l n="185">The world is round and God is everywhere ,</l>
     <l n="186">And while our shallop floats we still can steer .</l>
     <l n="187">So point her up , John King , nor'west by north .</l>
     <l n="188">We 'll keep the honour of a certain aim</l>
     <l n="189">Amid the peril of uncertain ways ,</l>
     <l n="190">And sail ahead , and leave the rest to God .</l>
