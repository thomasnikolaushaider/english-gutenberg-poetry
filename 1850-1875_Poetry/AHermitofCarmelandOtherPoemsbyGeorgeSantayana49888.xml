  <p>A HERMIT OF CARMEL</p>
   <p>SCENE .— A ravine amid the slopes of Mount Carmel . On one side a hermitage , on the other a rustic cross . The sun is about to set in the sea , which fills the background .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">HERMIT . Thou who wast tempted in the wilderness ,</l>
     <l n="2">Guard me this night , for there are snares in sleep</l>
     <l n="3">That baffle watching . O poisoned , bitter life</l>
     <l n="4">Of doubt and longing ! Were death possible ,</l>
     <l n="5">Who would not choose it ? But that dim estate</l>
     <l n="6">Might plunge my witless ghost in grosser matter</l>
     <l n="7">And in still closer meshes choke my life .</l>
     <l n="8">Yet thus to live is grievous agony ,</l>
     <l n="9">When sleep and thirst , hunger and weariness ,</l>
     <l n="10">And the sharp goads of thought-awakened lust</l>
     <l n="11">Torture the flesh , and inward doubt of all</l>
     <l n="12">Embitters with its lurking mockery</l>
     <l n="13">Virtue 's sad victories . This wilderness</l>
     <l n="14">Whither I fly from the approach of men</l>
     <l n="15">Keeps not the devil out . The treacherous glens</l>
     <l n="16">Are full of imps , and ghosts in moonlit vesture</l>
     <l n="17">Startle the watches of the lidless night .</l>
     <l n="18">The giant forest , in my youth so fair ,</l>
     <l n="19">Is now a den of demons ; the hoarse sea</l>
     <l n="20">Is foul with monsters hungry for my soul ;</l>
     <l n="21">The dark and pregnant soil , once innocent</l>
     <l n="22">Mother of flowers , reeks with venomous worms ,</l>
     <l n="23">And sore temptation is in all the world .</l>
     <l n="24">But hist ! A sound , as if of clanking hoofs .</l>
     <l n="25">Saint Anthony protect me from the fiend ,</l>
     <l n="26">Whether he come in guise of horned beast</l>
     <l n="27">Or of pernicious man ! If I must die</l>
     <l n="28">Be it upon this hallowed ground , O Lord !</l>

     <l n="490">Of burning rubbish and through sulphurous fumes .</l>
     <l n="491">That night he found him tied behind a cart —</l>
     <l n="492">The crawling palace of that savage chief</l>
     <l n="493">Whose greed had saved him . Shivering he stood ,</l>
     <l n="494">For they had stripped him , through the starlight hours ,</l>

     <l n="499">Of all he loved and knew , mangled and bare ,</l>
     <l n="500">Upbraiding heaven with their lidless eyes ,</l>
     <l n="501">And heaven 's eyes still smiling back at them ,</l>
     <l n="502">He said to his cold heart , “ There is no God . ”</l>
     <l n="503">And when the rosy dawn with jocund seeming</l>
     <l n="504">Gilded the valley as if naught had chanced ,</l>
     <l n="505">He , like the morning , banished grief and love ,</l>
     <l n="506">And in his vain and cruel heart repeating</l>
     <l n="507">“ There is no God , ” arose to greet the sun .</l>
     <l n="508">They took him to a village by a stream ,</l>
     <l n="509">And in the market sold him to a Jew ,</l>
     <l n="510">A long-robed man , who stroked thy brother 's hair —</l>
     <l n="511">‘ T was flaxen then and silken as thy own —</l>
     <l n="512">And chuckled as he hurried him away</l>
     <l n="513">Into a galley , by the margin moored .</l>
     <l n="514">They voyaged long , until they reached a vast</l>
     <l n="515">And splendid city . Egypt 's sunken shore</l>
     <l n="516">Stretches behind it , and before its walls</l>
     <l n="517">Pharos , by day a pillar and by night</l>
     <l n="518">A flaming beacon , greets the mariner .</l>
     <l n="519">‘ T is Satan 's capital . If holy men</l>
     <l n="520">Have dwelt within it , teaching all the Church ,</l>
     <l n="521">That was of old . Now Saracens and Jews</l>
     <l n="522">Possess it wholly . There no Christian thrives ,</l>
     <l n="523">But every monstrous and lascivious crime</l>
     <l n="524">Findeth a palace or a den to hide it .</l>
     <l n="525">There did thy brother waste his youth , a slave ,</l>
     <l n="526">And no unwilling service did he render</l>
     <l n="527">To every base command . His shepherd 's skin ,</l>
     <l n="528">Ruddy with mountain suns , they smoothed with unguents ,</l>
     <l n="529">And bleached in pillared courts ; they shaved his hair ,</l>
     <l n="530">Forbade him labour , save to hold a torch</l>
     <l n="531">While his young masters read , or at the banquet</l>
     <l n="532">To mix the lucent sherbets with the snows</l>
     <l n="533">Of Sinai 's deepest gorge , or in the censer</l>
     <l n="534">To drop large incense-grains . He learned to sing</l>
     <l n="535">What songs of wine their ribald poets penned ,</l>
     <l n="536">And all the witch of Lesbos raved of love .</l>
     <l n="537">The lute and timbrel in his skilful hands</l>
     <l n="538">They loved to place ; oft in their languid souls</l>
     <l n="539">His wild chant roused some savage memory</l>
     <l n="540">And their hearts leapt like leopards in the night</l>
     <l n="541">That prowl through broad Sahara . His delight</l>
     <l n="542">Was henceforth the choice morsel , the fat fee ,</l>
     <l n="543">The subtle theft . He brought the gossip home</l>
     <l n="544">From the loud market , lest his lord should yawn</l>
     <l n="545">The morning long beneath the barber 's hands ,</l>
     <l n="546">Nor praise his wit and to the tittering group</l>
     <l n="547">Repeat his story . In the brothel streets</l>
     <l n="548">He ran sly errands , nor escaped in fear</l>
     <l n="549">If as he passed some wife of Potiphar</l>
     <l n="550">Plucked at his tunic . His best art it was</l>
     <l n="551">To know the cunning mixture of good wines</l>
     <l n="552">And poisons too , if some adulterous slave</l>
     <l n="553">Or long-lived uncle or importunate brother</l>
     <l n="554">Needed a poison .— Close about his soul</l>
     <l n="555">This bitter flood of luxury crept up</l>
     <l n="556">Until it choked him . He forgot the past</l>
     <l n="557">And blushed to be a Christian . Their vain prayers</l>
     <l n="558">He learned to mutter , and was circumcised .</l>
     <l n="559">Thrice in the day , and dawn and noon and eve ,</l>
     <l n="560">He washed his feet and hands , a foolish rite</l>
     <l n="561">That left the soul still foul . Twice seven devils</l>
     <l n="562">Lodged in his body and tormented him ,</l>
     <l n="563">And lust pursued him when all ways of lust</l>
     <l n="564">Were stale and sickened .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="68">
     <l n="565">But there came an end .</l>
     <l n="566">For by the flesh as he had chiefly sinned ,</l>
     <l n="567">So in the flesh he had his punishment .</l>
     <l n="568">Ulcers and boils , to make another Job ,</l>
     <l n="569">Thickened upon him , and his beauty gone ,</l>
     <l n="570">They drove him like a pest from all their gates</l>
     <l n="571">Among the lepers . Then he called on God .</l>
     <l n="572">Then he remembered all he once had heard</l>
     <l n="573">But understood not touching Calvary ;</l>
     <l n="574">And rising up , all naked as he was ,</l>
     <l n="575">He plucked the stout stem of a bramble-bush</l>
     <l n="576">To be his palmer 's staff , and with a rag</l>
     <l n="577">That once had been the blanket of a mule</l>
     <l n="578">Girded his loins , and stalked into the wild .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="73">
     <l n="606">They are strange shapes the devil sometimes takes .</l>
     <l n="607">There was a vine that crept along this wall ,</l>
     <l n="608">Ancient and knotted ; far its branches spread</l>
     <l n="609">And with their leafy greenness made a bower</l>
     <l n="610">Over my cell . The juicy clusters hung</l>
     <l n="611">Not far above me , and the little birds</l>
     <l n="612">Chirped in the sun-flecked tangle all day long ,</l>
     <l n="613">Hopping from twig to twig and carolling .</l>
     <l n="614">I sat and listened , and methought they said :</l>

     <l n="617">Thou art all nature 's single enemy . ”</l>

     <l n="619">I sat and pondered what they sang to me .</l>
     <l n="620">Then I looked up into the sunlit maze</l>
     <l n="621">Of that old vine , I breathed its subtle scent ,</l>
     <l n="622">I watched its spotted shadows shift and change</l>
     <l n="623">With gusty murmurous tremblings of its leaves</l>
     <l n="624">And eager tendrils , curling through the air ,</l>
     <l n="625">Until it seemed as if the thing had life</l>
     <l n="626">And was a devil stooping over me</l>
     <l n="627">With the obsession of his purring breath</l>
     <l n="628">Wooing me to perdition . But I laughed ,</l>
     <l n="629">For I had dealt with imps of hell before .</l>
     <l n="630">I searched the stubble till I found two flints ,</l>

     <l n="632">And straight about the vine 's outspreading roots</l>
     <l n="633">Began to dig . A week , methinks , I dug</l>
     <l n="634">With secret joy , well knowing that in vain</l>
     <l n="635">The demon thought to ripen all his grapes .</l>
     <l n="636">His filthy roots , now dangling in the air ,</l>

    <head>THE SOUL</head>
     <l n="1">My heaven lives , bright angel , in thine eyes .</l>
     <l n="2">As when , beside the Lake of Galilee ,</l>
     <l n="3">John , o'er his meshes bent ,</l>

     <l n="5">When God said , Follow me ;</l>

     <l n="7">And , looking in thine eyes , I am content ,</l>
     <l n="8">And with thy sweet voice for all argument</l>
     <l n="9">I leave my tangled nets beside the sea .</l>
     <l n="10">Done is my feigned task ,</l>
     <l n="11">Fallen the mask</l>
     <l n="12">That made me other , O my soul , than thee .</l>
     <l n="13">I have fulfilled my pain</l>
     <l n="14">And borne my cross ,</l>
     <l n="15">And my great gain</l>
     <l n="16">Is to have known my loss .</l>
     <l n="17">Keep , blessed vision , keep</l>
     <l n="18">The sacred beauty that entranced my soul .</l>

    <head>THE POETIC MEDIUM</head>
     <l n="1">In Chelsea dwells a Sibyl known to fame</l>
     <l n="2">Called Mrs. Fakir — necromantic name !</l>
     <l n="3">Past , present , future , open to her view</l>
     <l n="4">She ( for ten dollars ) will reveal to you .</l>
     <l n="5">I for less sums — the discount to the trade —</l>
     <l n="6">Quaff at her fount and seek her undismayed .</l>
     <l n="7">I found the priestess in her wonted lair</l>
     <l n="8">Up three steep flights of narrow dirty stair .</l>
     <l n="9">Chill was the darkened chamber . A thick fume</l>
     <l n="10">Of kerosene lent odour to the gloom .</l>
     <l n="11">Clothed in black weeds , pale , with delirious hair ,</l>
     <l n="12">Rocked Mrs. Fakir in her rocking-chair .</l>
     <l n="13">I told my errand ; with some hushed complaint</l>
     <l n="14">About the fee , she fell into a faint ,</l>
     <l n="15">Thrice rolled her eyes , thrice snorted through her nose ,</l>
     <l n="16">Thrice wrung her hands , and wriggled thrice her toes ,</l>
     <l n="17">Then spoke . ( I versify : she uttered vulgar prose . )</l>
     <l n="18">“ You want some verse : not every poet 's soul</l>
     <l n="19">Whose aid you crave is still in my control .</l>
     <l n="20">Whom would you summon ? You must ask the boon</l>
     <l n="21">Of some frail wight that floats below the moon .</l>
     <l n="22">The spirits that have risen to the stars</l>
     <l n="23">Reck not the echoes of our earthly jars .</l>
     <l n="24">Their troubles past , they have forgotten ours ,</l>
     <l n="25">And move unmoved by even magic powers .</l>
     <l n="26">Only weak souls entangled in the mesh</l>
     <l n="27">Of passion , dying , still are bond to flesh ,</l>
     <l n="28">And hover o'er the battle-field of life</l>
     <l n="29">To smell their kindred blood and pine for strife .</l>
     <l n="30">Such I may summon , for they have no choice</l>
     <l n="31">Who crave to live again and find a voice . ”</l>
     <l n="32">“ ‘ T is well , ” I answered . “ If the gods so please ,</l>
     <l n="33">We will not call on Aristophanes ,</l>
     <l n="34">Horace shall slumber , Juvenal be dumb .</l>
     <l n="35">They rest in peace . But haply Swift will come . ”</l>
     <l n="36">“ Not Swift , ” she said , “ not Swift . I cannot tell</l>
     <l n="37">Whether he flew to heaven or to hell ,</l>
     <l n="38">But he is gone far from this mild , low-born ,</l>
     <l n="39">And canting age , incapable of scorn . ”</l>
     <l n="40">“ Well , summon Byron , then , ” I said and sighed .</l>
     <l n="41">“ Byron is also safe , ” the witch replied .</l>
     <l n="42">“ The first sin punished and the first forgiven</l>
     <l n="43">Is love 's , the slip of climbers into heaven .</l>
     <l n="44">The petted passion and the shallow dream</l>
     <l n="45">He purged at last ; the heart survived supreme . ”</l>
     <l n="46">“ Byron gone too , ” thought I , “ what wit remains</l>
     <l n="47">All younger sprites have water in their veins .</l>
     <l n="48">But , ah ! might not the living help me out ?</l>
     <l n="49">Do n't phantoms of the living flit about ? ”</l>
     <l n="50">“ They do , they do , ” quoth Chelsea 's Pythoness .</l>
     <l n="51">“ Here in my telepathic cave 's recess</l>
     <l n="52">All that they say or think or wish or feel</l>
     <l n="53">I read aloud , but most what they conceal .</l>
     <l n="54">Whom would you plagiarise ? You ‘ re silent ? Why ,</l>
     <l n="55">Have you forgot the ages galaxy — ”</l>
     <l n="56">I trembled as she named them one by one ,</l>
     <l n="57">From Willy Frilly down to Spider Spun .</l>
     <l n="58">“ Spare me , ” I cried . “ Shall some prolific bard</l>
     <l n="59">Reel off bright lyrics at a cent a yard ,</l>
     <l n="60">All about April rain , December snow ,</l>
     <l n="61">The brook , the sunset , and the squawking crow ?</l>
     <l n="62">Shall little Swinburnes turn a verse with ease</l>
     <l n="63">And sing the flaccid pleasures of disease ?</l>
     <l n="64">Shall mimics , drunk with each Castalian rill ,</l>
     <l n="65">Be any poet but themselves at will ,</l>
     <l n="66">Luscious when Keats , when Spenser quaint and dull ,</l>
     <l n="67">When Browning turgid , and Noodles null ?</l>
     <l n="68">Shall weaklings , in thick verse and tortured prose ,</l>
     <l n="69">Strike affectation 's quintessential pose ,</l>
     <l n="70">Sniffing the odours of a perfumed brain</l>
     <l n="71">Where melts a Wordsworth plus a Paul Verlaine ?</l>
     <l n="72">When , with no art , were precious fabrics wrought ,</l>
     <l n="73">When metaphysics with no mastering thought ?</l>
     <l n="74">No , Mrs. Fakir , none of this small fry .</l>
     <l n="75">Catch me some ghost of sense , or else good-bye .</l>
     <l n="76">Not at my bidding shall this choir prolong</l>
     <l n="77">The cloying drivel of unmeaning song ,</l>
     <l n="78">Enrich the echo , maul the note and tease ,</l>
     <l n="79">Miauling nothing in a hundred keys .</l>
     <l n="80">Better Pope 's squirrel eye and polished sneer</l>
     <l n="81">Than idiot mouthings , false without veneer .</l>
     <l n="82">Better Boileau 's ‘ monotony in wire , ’</l>
     <l n="83">Dressing good wit in periwigged attire ;</l>
     <l n="84">For in a garden 's alleys or a wood</l>
     <l n="85">Hung all in green , monotony is good ,</l>
     <l n="86">And a frail stem may need a bit of wire</l>
     <l n="87">To keep the rose from trailing in the mire .</l>
     <l n="88">Never will they dig deep or build for time</l>
     <l n="89">Who of unreason weave a maze of rhyme ,</l>
     <l n="90">Worship a weakness , nurse a whim , and bind</l>
     <l n="91">Wreaths about temples tenantless of mind ,</l>
     <l n="92">Forsake the path the seeing Muses trod ,</l>
     <l n="93">And shatter Nature to discover God .</l>
     <l n="94">He only climbs the skies and proudly sings</l>
     <l n="95">Whose heart , attentive , feels the pulse of things ,</l>
     <l n="96">Masters the fact , and hails the changeless goal</l>
     <l n="97">That beckons , purges , and fulfils the soul . ”</l>
     <l n="98">I ceased : no ghost was willing to befriend ,</l>
     <l n="99">And all the living useless to my end .</l>
     <l n="100">Meantime the hag awoke with vacant stare ,</l>
     <l n="101">And passed her bony fingers through her hair .</l>
     <l n="102">I left her den and hastened back to town ,</l>
     <l n="103">Writing the while my sad experience down .</l>
     <l n="104">This you have heard . ‘ T is little that I give ,</l>
     <l n="105">But it makes sense . Long , masters , may you live .</l>

     <l n="1">Mid Uncle Sam 's expanded acres</l>
     <l n="2">There 's an old , secluded glade</l>
     <l n="3">Where grey Puritans and Quakers</l>
     <l n="4">Still grow fervid in the shade ;</l>
     <l n="5">And the same great elms and beeches</l>
     <l n="6">That once graced the ancestral farm ,</l>
     <l n="7">Bending to the old men 's speeches ,</l>
     <l n="8">Lend their words an echo 's charm .</l>
     <l n="9">Laurel , clematis , and vine</l>
     <l n="10">Weave green trellises about ,</l>
     <l n="11">And three maples and a pine</l>

     <l n="13">Yet the smoke of trade and battle</l>
     <l n="14">Cannot quite be banished hence ,</l>

     <l n="79">Of the joys of this world 's giving</l>

     <l n="215">Of freedom : base , without the touch of awe ,</l>
     <l n="216">He poisoned first the blood his poniard was to draw .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="25">
     <l n="217">By sloth and lust and mindlessness and pelf</l>
     <l n="218">Spain sank in sadness and dishonour down ,</l>
     <l n="219">Each in her service serving but himself ,</l>
     <l n="220">Each in his passion striking at her crown .</l>
     <l n="221">Not that these treasons blotted her renown</l>
     <l n="222">Emblazoned higher than such hands can reach :</l>
     <l n="223">There where she reaped but sorrow she has sown</l>
     <l n="224">The balm of sorrow ; all she had to teach</l>
     <l n="225">She taught the younger world — her faith and heart and speech .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="26">
     <l n="226">And now within her sea-girt walls withdrawn</l>
     <l n="227">She waits in silence for the healing years ,</l>
     <l n="228">While where her sun has set a second dawn</l>
     <l n="229">Comes from the north , with other hopes and fears .</l>
     <l n="230">Spain 's daughters stand , half ceasing from their tears ,</l>
     <l n="231">And watch the skies from Cuba to the Horn .</l>
     <l n="232">“ What is this dove or eagle that appears , ”</l>
     <l n="233">They seem to cry , “ what herald of what morn</l>
     <l n="234">Hovers o'er Andes ’ peaks in love or guile or scorn ? ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="27">
     <l n="235">“ O brooding Spirit , fledgling of the North ,</l>
     <l n="236">Winged for the levels of its shifting light ,</l>
     <l n="237">Child of a labouring ocean and an earth</l>
     <l n="238">Shrouded in vapours , fear the southward flight ,</l>
     <l n="239">Dread waveless waters and their warm delight ,</l>
     <l n="240">Beware of peaks that cleave the cloudless blue</l>
     <l n="241">And hold communion with the naked night .</l>
     <l n="242">The souls went never back that hither flew ,</l>
     <l n="243">But sighing fell to earth or broke the heavens through .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="28">
     <l n="244">“ Haunt still thy storm-swept islands , and endure</l>
     <l n="245">The shimmering forest where thy visions live .</l>
     <l n="246">Then if we love thee — for thy heart is pure — Thou</l>
     <l n="247">shalt have something worthy love to give .</l>
     <l n="248">Thrust not thy prophets on us , nor believe</l>
     <l n="249">Thy sorry riches in our eyes are fair .</l>
     <l n="250">Thy unctuous sophists never will deceive</l>
     <l n="251">A mortal pang , or charm away despair .</l>
     <l n="252">Not for the stranger 's fee we plait our lustrous hair .</l>

     <l n="253">“ But of thy lingering twilight bring some gleam ,</l>
     <l n="254">Memorial of the immaterial fire</l>
     <l n="255">Lighting thy heart , and to a wider dream</l>
     <l n="256">Waken the music of our plaintive lyre .</l>
     <l n="257">Check our rash word , hush , hush our base desire .</l>
     <l n="258">Hang paler clouds of reverence about</l>
     <l n="259">Our garish skies : laborious hope inspire</l>
     <l n="260">That uncomplaining walks the paths of doubt ,</l>
     <l n="261">A wistful heart within , a mailed breast without .</l>

     <l n="264">Bring labour 's joy , yet spare that better part</l>
     <l n="265">Our mother , Spain , bequeathed to all she bore ,</l>
     <l n="266">For who shall covet if he once adore ?</l>
     <l n="267">Leave in our skies , strange Spirit passing there ,</l>
     <l n="268">No less of vision but of courage more ,</l>
     <l n="269">And of our worship take thy equal share ,</l>
     <l n="270">Thou who wouldst teach us hope , with her who taught us prayer . ”</l>

    <head>YOUTH 'S IMMORTALITY</head>
     <l n="1">What , when hearts have met , shall sever</l>
     <l n="2">Heart from heart , though heaven fall ?</l>
     <l n="3">They alone are dead for ever</l>
     <l n="4">Who have never lived at all .</l>
     <l n="5">Roses that have bloomed to sweetness</l>
     <l n="6">Never can untimely fade ,</l>
     <l n="7">Blessed by death in their completeness</l>
     <l n="8">And on beauty 's bosom laid ,</l>
     <l n="9">Garnered in the breast eternal</l>
     <l n="10">Where all noble joys are one ,</l>
     <l n="11">Sweet Elysium , fair and vernal ,</l>
     <l n="12">Where they mount who face the sun .</l>
     <l n="13">Happy he whom men call lonely ,</l>
     <l n="14">Whose companion is the truth ,</l>
     <l n="15">And whose heart is ravished only</l>
     <l n="16">By the world 's immortal youth .</l>
     <l n="17">Happy he whose single treasure</l>
     <l n="18">Is the infinite unfurled ,</l>
     <l n="19">And whose voice has caught the measure</l>
     <l n="20">Of the music of the world .</l>
     <l n="21">When Death gathers up our ashes</l>
     <l n="22">And our sorry shades depart ,</l>
     <l n="23">Lo , Life 's flame , rekindled , flashes</l>
     <l n="24">From another mortal heart ,</l>
     <l n="25">And Death turns about , derided</l>
     <l n="26">By the Life he would deride .</l>
     <l n="27">Vainly space and time divided</l>
     <l n="28">What eternity allied .</l>
     <l n="29">One great hope guides all our seeing ,</l>
     <l n="30">One pure heaven lends us light .</l>
     <l n="31">Love is still the crown of being ,</l>
     <l n="32">Faith the better part of sight .</l>
     <l n="33">The same wisdom 's ancient pages</l>
     <l n="34">Stir again the generous soul</l>
     <l n="35">To the mighty task of ages</l>
     <l n="36">Crawling still to reason 's goal .</l>
     <l n="37">The prophetic Muse of Story</l>
     <l n="38">Sings her ancient legend o'er ,</l>
     <l n="39">And the sea , still young and hoary ,</l>
     <l n="40">Chants along the beaten shore .</l>
     <l n="41">Spring yet yields her flowery treasures</l>
     <l n="42">To the guiltless hands of boys ,</l>
     <l n="43">Chastening their noisy pleasures</l>
     <l n="44">To the depth of human joys .</l>
     <l n="45">One eternal passion drives us ,</l>
     <l n="46">Zealots of the stars above ,</l>
     <l n="47">And our better part survives us ,</l>
     <l n="48">Living in the things we love .</l>
