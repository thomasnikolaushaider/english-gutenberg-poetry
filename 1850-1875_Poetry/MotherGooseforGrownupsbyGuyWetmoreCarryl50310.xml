    <p>TO CONSTANCE In memory of other days , Dear critic , when your whispered praise Cheered on the limping pen . How short , how sweet those younger hours , How bright our suns , how few our showers , Alas , we knew not then ! If but , long leagues across the seas , The trivial charm of rhymes like these Shall serve to link us twain An instant in the olden spell That once we knew and loved so well , I have not worked in vain !

      <head>OF</head>
      <head>JILTED JACK</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">A noble and a generous mind</l>
       <l n="2">Was Jack 's ;</l>
       <l n="3">Folks knew he would not talk behind</l>
       <l n="4">Their backs :</l>
       <l n="5">But when some maiden fresh and young ,</l>
       <l n="6">At Jack a bit of banter flung ,</l>
       <l n="7">She soon discovered that his tongue</l>
       <l n="8">Was sharp as any ax .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="9">A flirt of most engaging wiles</l>
       <l n="10">Was Jill ;</l>
       <l n="11">On Jack she lavished all her smiles ,</l>
       <l n="12">Until</l>
       <l n="13">Her slave ( and he was not the first )</l>
       <l n="14">Of lovesick swains became the worst ,</l>
       <l n="15">His glance a strong box might have burst ,</l>
       <l n="16">His sighs were fit to kill .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="17">One April morning , clear and fair ,</l>
       <l n="18">When both</l>
       <l n="19">Of staying home and idling there</l>
       <l n="20">In sloth</l>
       <l n="21">Were weary , Jack remarked to Jill :</l>
       <l n="22">“ Oh , what 's the sense in sitting still ?</l>
       <l n="23">Let 's mount the slope of yonder hill . ”</l>
       <l n="24">And she was nothing loth .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="25">But as she answered : “ What 's the use ? ”</l>
       <l n="26">The gruff</l>
       <l n="27">Young swain replied : “ Oh , there 's excuse</l>
       <l n="28">Enough .</l>
       <l n="29">Your doting parents water lack ;</l>
       <l n="30">We 'll fill a pail and bring it back . ”</l>
       <l n="31">( The reader will perceive that Jack</l>
       <l n="32">Was putting up a bluff . )</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="33">Thus hand in hand the tempting hill</l>
       <l n="34">They scaled ,</l>
       <l n="35">And Jack proposed a kiss to Jill ,</l>
       <l n="36">And failed !</l>
       <l n="37">One backward start , one step too bold ,</l>
       <l n="38">And down the hill the couple rolled ,</l>
       <l n="39">Resembling , if the truth were told ,</l>
       <l n="40">A luggage train derailed .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="41">With eyes ablaze with anger , she</l>
       <l n="42">Exclaimed :</l>
       <l n="43">“ Well , who 'd have thought ! You 'd ought to be</l>
       <l n="44">Ashamed !</l>
       <l n="45">You quite forget yourself , it 's plain ,</l>
       <l n="46">So I 'll forget you , too . Insane</l>
       <l n="47">Young man , I 'll say oafweederzane . ”</l>
       <l n="48">( Her German might be blamed . )</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="49">But Jack , whose linguist 's pride was pricked ,</l>
       <l n="50">To shine ,</l>
       <l n="51">Asked : “ Meine Königin will nicht</l>
       <l n="52">Be mine ? ”</l>
       <l n="53">And when she answered : “ Nein ” in spleen ,</l>
       <l n="54">He cried : “ Then in the soup tureen</l>
       <l n="55">You 'll stay . You 're not the only queen</l>
       <l n="56">Discarded for a nein ! ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="57">THE MORAL 'S made for maidens young</l>
       <l n="58">And small :</l>
       <l n="59">If you would in a foreign tongue</l>
       <l n="60">Enthrall ,</l>
       <l n="61">Lead off undaunted in a Swede</l>
       <l n="62">Or Spanish speech , and you 'll succeed ,</l>
       <l n="63">But they who in a German lead</l>
       <l n="64">No favor win at all .</l>

       <l n="2">Whose features</l>
       <l n="3">Are hard beyond any reclaim ;</l>
       <l n="4">And she loved in a hovel</l>
       <l n="5">To grovel ,</l>
       <l n="6">And she had n't a cent to her name .</l>
       <l n="7">She owned neither gallants</l>

       <l n="9">She borrowed extensively , too ,</l>
       <l n="10">From all of her dozens</l>
       <l n="11">Of cousins ,</l>
       <l n="12">And never refunded a sou :</l>

       <l n="33">The colley was barred in</l>

     <p>Mother Hubbard cried loudly And proudly : “ Lands sakes ! but you give yourselves airs ! I 'll take the law to you And sue you . ” The neighbors responded : “ Who cares ? We none of us care if The sheriff Lock every man jack of us up ; We wo n't be repining At fining So long as we 're rid of the pup ! ” They then proceeded to mount a sign , Bearing this ominous countersign : “ FREEMEN !

       <l n="1">A knack almost incredible for dealing with an edible</l>
       <l n="2">Jack Horner 's elder sister was acknowledged to display ;</l>
       <l n="3">She labored hard and zealously , but always guarded jealously</l>
       <l n="4">The secrets of the dishes she invented every day .</l>
       <l n="5">She 'd take some indigestible , unpopular comestible ,</l>

       <l n="11">The acme of facility , the zenith of ability</l>
       <l n="12">Was what she gave her brother for his Christmas Day repast .</l>
       <l n="13">He dined that evening eagerly and anything but meagerly ,</l>

       <l n="15">With sisterly benignity , and just a touch of dignity ,</l>
       <l n="16">She placed upon the table an unutterable pie !</l>

       <l n="15">A hideous spider was sitting beside her</l>

      <head>THE UNUSUAL UBIQUITY</head>
      <head>OF</head>
      <head>THE INQUISITIVE GANDER</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">A gander dwelt upon a farm</l>
       <l n="2">And no one could resist him ,</l>
       <l n="3">For had he died , such was his charm ,</l>
       <l n="4">His neighbors would have missed him :</l>
       <l n="5">His scorn for any loud display ,</l>
       <l n="6">His cheerful hissing day by day ,</l>
       <l n="7">Would win your heart in such a way</l>
       <l n="8">You almost could have kissed him .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="9">This bird was always nosing ‘ round .</l>
       <l n="10">Most patiently he waited</l>
       <l n="11">Until an open door he found ,</l>
       <l n="12">And then investigated .</l>
       <l n="13">He loved to poke , he loved to peek ,</l>
       <l n="14">In every knothole , so to speak ,</l>
       <l n="15">He quickly thrust his prying beak ,</l>
       <l n="16">For what was hid he hated .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="17">The farm exhausted : “ Now , ” said he :</l>
       <l n="18">“ My policy 's expansion .</l>
       <l n="19">When one 's convinced how things should be</l>
       <l n="20">The proper course he can n't shun .</l>
       <l n="21">His mind made up , he followed it ,</l>
       <l n="22">Relying on his native wit ,</l>
       <l n="23">And soon had wandered , bit by bit ,</l>
       <l n="24">Through all his master 's mansion .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="25">“ At least , ” he said : “ It 's not my fault</l>
       <l n="26">If everything 's not seen to :</l>
       <l n="27">I 've gone from garret down to vault ,</l>
       <l n="28">And glanced into the lean-to .</l>
       <l n="29">In every room I 've chanced to stop ;</l>
       <l n="30">A supervising glance to drop ,</l>
       <l n="31">I 've looked below , I 've looked on top ,</l>
       <l n="32">Behind , and in between , too ! ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="33">One thing alone he found to blame ,</l>
       <l n="34">As thus his time he squandered ,</l>
       <l n="35">For , seeing not the farmer 's dame ,</l>
       <l n="36">Into her room he wandered ,</l>
       <l n="37">And mounting nimbly on the bed :</l>
       <l n="38">“ Why , bless my careful soul ! ” he said :</l>
       <l n="39">“ These pillows are as hard as lead .</l>
       <l n="40">Now , how comes that ? ” he pondered .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="41">The farmer 's dame for half an hour</l>
       <l n="42">Had watched the bird meander ,</l>
       <l n="43">And finding him within her power ,</l>
       <l n="44">She leaped upon the gander .</l>
       <l n="45">“ Why , how de do , my gander coy ? ”</l>
       <l n="46">She shouted : “ What will be my joy</l>
       <l n="47">To dream to-night on you , my boy ! ”</l>
       <l n="48">( This was no baseless slander . )</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="49">For with a stoutish piece of string</l>
       <l n="50">Securely was this fool tied ,</l>
       <l n="51">And by a leg and by a wing</l>
       <l n="52">Unto an oaken stool tied :</l>
       <l n="53">While , pinning towels around her gown ,</l>
       <l n="54">She plucked him with relentless frown ,</l>
       <l n="55">And stuffed the pillows with his down ,</l>
       <l n="56">And roasted him for Yuletide .</l>

       <l n="57">THE MORAL is : When you explore</l>
       <l n="58">Do n't try to be superior :</l>
       <l n="59">Be cautious , and retire before</l>
       <l n="60">Your safety grows inferior .</l>
       <l n="61">‘ Tis best to stay upon the coast ,</l>
       <l n="62">Or some day you will be like most</l>
       <l n="63">Of all that bold exploring host</l>
       <l n="64">That 's gone to the interior .</l>
