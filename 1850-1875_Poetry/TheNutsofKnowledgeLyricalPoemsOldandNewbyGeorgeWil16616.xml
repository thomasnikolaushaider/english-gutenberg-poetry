    <docImprint>The Manager of the Dun Emer Press has to thank Mr. John Lane for permission to reprint ten poems from Homeward Songs By The Way , and ten from The Earth Breath . FOR BRIAN WHEN HE IS GROWN UP THIS HANDFUL OF THE NUTS OF KNOWLEDGE I HAVE GATHERED ON THE SECRET STREAMS . I thought , beloved , to have brought to you A gift of quietness and ease and peace , Cooling your brow as with the mystic dew Dropping from twilight trees . Homeward I go not yet ; the darkness grows ; Not mine the voice to still with peace divine : From the first fount the stream of quiet flows Through other hearts than mine . Yet of my night I give to you the stars , And of my sorrow here the sweetest gains , And out of hell , beyond its iron bars , My scorn of all its pains .</docImprint>

       <l n="2">A cabin on the mountain side hid in a grassy nook</l>
       <l n="3">Where door and windows open wide that friendly stars may look .</l>
       <l n="4">The rabbit shy can patter in , the winds may enter free ,</l>
       <l n="5">Who throng around the mountain throne in living ecstasy .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="6">And when the sun sets dimmed in eve and purple fills the air ,</l>
       <l n="7">I think the sacred Hazel Tree is dropping berries there</l>
       <l n="8">From starry fruitage waved aloft where Connla 's Well o'erflows ;</l>
       <l n="9">For sure the enchanted waters pour through every wind that blows .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="10">I think when night towers up aloft and shakes the trembling dew</l>
       <l n="11">How every high and lonely thought that thrills my being through</l>
       <l n="12">Is but a ruddy berry dropped down through the purple air ,</l>
       <l n="13">And from the magic tree of life the fruit falls everywhere .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">We must pass like smoke or live within the spirit 's fire ;</l>

       <l n="1">Now the quietude of earth</l>
       <l n="2">Nestles deep my heart within ;</l>

       <l n="9">Now the silver light of dawn</l>

      <head>A VISION OF BEAUTY</head>
       <l n="1">Where we sat at dawn together , while the star-rich heavens shifted ,</l>
       <l n="2">We were weaving dreams in silence , suddenly the veil was lifted .</l>
       <l n="3">By a hand of fire awakened , in a moment caught and led</l>
       <l n="4">Upward to the wondrous vision : through the star-mists overhead</l>
       <l n="5">Flare and flaunt the monstrous highlands ; on the sapphire coast of night</l>
       <l n="6">Fall the ghostly froth and fringes of the ocean of the light .</l>
       <l n="7">Many coloured shine the vapours : to the moon-eye far away</l>
       <l n="8">‘ Tis the fairy ring of twilight mid the spheres of night and day ,</l>
       <l n="9">Girdling with a rainbow cincture round the planet where we go ,</l>
       <l n="10">We and it together fleeting , poised upon the pearl glow ;</l>
       <l n="11">We and it and all together flashing through the starry spaces</l>
       <l n="12">In a tempest dream of beauty lighting up the place of places .</l>
       <l n="13">Half our eyes behold the glory : half within the spirit 's glow</l>
       <l n="14">Echoes of the noiseless revels and the will of beauty go .</l>
       <l n="15">By a hand of fire uplifted — to her star-strewn palace brought ,</l>
       <l n="16">To the mystic heart of beauty and the secret of her thought :</l>
       <l n="17">Here of yore the ancient mother in the fire mists sank to rest ,</l>
       <l n="18">And she built her dreams about her , rayed from out her burning breast :</l>
       <l n="19">Here the wild will woke within her lighting up her flying dreams ,</l>
       <l n="20">Round and round the planets whirling break in woods and flowers and streams ,</l>
       <l n="21">And the winds are shaken from them as the leaves from off the rose ,</l>
       <l n="22">And the feet of earth go dancing in the way that beauty goes ,</l>
       <l n="23">And the souls of earth are kindled by the incense of her breath</l>
       <l n="24">As her light alternate lures them through the gates of birth and death .</l>
       <l n="25">O'er the fields of space together following her flying traces ,</l>
       <l n="26">In a radiant tumult thronging , suns and stars and myriad races</l>
       <l n="27">Mount the spirit spires of beauty , reaching onward to the day</l>
       <l n="28">When the Shepherd of the Ages draws his misty hordes away</l>
       <l n="29">Through the glimmering deeps to silence , and within the awful fold</l>
       <l n="30">Life and joy and love forever vanish as a tale is told ,</l>
       <l n="31">Lost within the mother 's being . So the vision flamed and fled ,</l>
       <l n="32">And before the glory fallen every other dream lay dead .</l>

      <head>THE EARTH BREATH</head>
       <l n="1">From the cool and dark-lipped furrow breathes a dim delight</l>
       <l n="2">Through the woodland 's purple plumage to the diamond night .</l>
       <l n="3">Aureoles of joy encircle every blade of grass</l>
       <l n="4">Where the dew-fed creatures silent and enraptured pass .</l>
       <l n="5">And the restless ploughman pauses , turns , and wondering ,</l>
       <l n="6">Deep beneath his rustic habit finds himself a king ;</l>
       <l n="7">For a fiery moment looking with the eyes of God</l>
       <l n="8">Over fields a slave at morning bowed him to the sod .</l>
       <l n="9">Blind and dense with revelation every moment flies .</l>
       <l n="10">And unto the mighty mother , gay , eternal , rise</l>
       <l n="11">All the hopes we hold , the gladness , dreams of things to be .</l>
       <l n="12">One of all thy generations , mother , hails to thee .</l>
       <l n="13">Hail , and hail , and hail for ever , though I turn again</l>
       <l n="14">From thy joy unto the human vestiture of pain .</l>
       <l n="15">I , thy child who went forth radiant in the golden prime ,</l>
       <l n="16">Find thee still the mother-hearted through my night in time :</l>
       <l n="17">Find in thee the old enchantment there behind the veil</l>
       <l n="18">Where the gods , my brothers , linger . Hail , for ever hail !</l>

      <head>THE MASTER SINGER</head>
       <l n="1">A laughter in the diamond air , a music in the trembling grass ;</l>
       <l n="2">And one by one the words of light as joydrops through my being pass .</l>
       <l n="3">I am the sunlight in the heart , the silver moonglow in the mind ;</l>
       <l n="4">My laughter runs and ripples through the wavy tresses of the wind .</l>
       <l n="5">I am the fire upon the hills , the dancing flame that leads afar</l>
       <l n="6">Each burning-hearted wanderer , and I the dear and homeward star .</l>
       <l n="7">A myriad lovers died for me , and in their latest yielded breath</l>
       <l n="8">I woke in glory giving them immortal life though touched by death .</l>
       <l n="9">They knew me from the dawn of time : if Hermes beats his rainbow wings ,</l>
       <l n="10">If Angus shakes his locks of light , or golden-haired Apollo sings ,</l>
       <l n="11">It matters not the name , the land ; my joy in all the gods abides :</l>
       <l n="12">Even in the cricket in the grass some dimness of me smiles and hides .</l>
       <l n="13">For joy of me the day star glows , and in delight and wild desire</l>
       <l n="14">The peacock twilight rays aloft its plumes and blooms of shadowy fire ,</l>
       <l n="15">Where in the vastness too I burn through summer nights and ages long ,</l>
       <l n="16">And with the fiery footed Watchers shake in myriad dance and song .</l>

      <head>APHRODITE</head>
       <l n="1">Not unremembering we pass our exile from the starry ways :</l>
       <l n="2">One timeless hour in time we caught from the long night of endless days .</l>
       <l n="3">With solemn gaiety the stars danced far withdrawn on elfin heights :</l>
       <l n="4">The lilac breathed amid the shade of green and blue and citron lights .</l>
       <l n="5">But yet the close enfolding night seemed on the phantom verge of things ,</l>
       <l n="6">For our adoring hearts had turned within from all their wanderings :</l>
       <l n="7">For beauty called to beauty and there thronged at the enchanter 's will</l>
       <l n="8">The vanished hours of love that burn within the Ever-living still .</l>
       <l n="9">And sweet eternal faces put the shadows of the earth to rout ,</l>
       <l n="10">And faint and fragile as a moth your white hand fluttered and went out .</l>
       <l n="11">Oh , who am I who tower beside this goddess of the twilight air ?</l>
       <l n="12">The burning doves fly from my heart and melt within her bosom there .</l>
       <l n="13">I know the sacrifice of old they offered to the mighty queen ,</l>
       <l n="14">And this adoring love has brought us back the beauty that has been .</l>
       <l n="15">As to her worshippers she came descending from her glowing skies</l>
       <l n="16">So Aphrodite I have seen with shining eyes look through your eyes :</l>
       <l n="17">One gleam of the ancestral face which lighted up the dawn for me :</l>
       <l n="18">One fiery visitation of the love the gods desire in thee !</l>

      <head>BABYLON</head>
       <l n="1">The blue dusk ran between the streets ; my love was winged within my mind ;</l>
       <l n="2">It left to-day and yesterday and thrice a thousand years behind .</l>
       <l n="3">To-day was past and dead for me for from to-day my feet had run</l>
       <l n="4">Through thrice a thousand years to walk the ways of ancient Babylon .</l>
       <l n="5">On temple top and palace roof the burnished gold flung back the rays</l>
       <l n="6">Of a red sunset that was dead and lost beyond a million days .</l>
       <l n="7">The tower of heaven turns darker blue ; a starry sparkle now begins ;</l>
       <l n="8">The mystery and magnificence , the myriad beauty and the sins</l>
       <l n="9">Come back to me . I walk beneath the shadowy multitude of towers ;</l>
       <l n="10">Within the gloom the fountain jets its pallid mist in lily flowers .</l>
       <l n="11">The waters lull me , and the scent of many gardens , and I hear</l>
       <l n="12">Familiar voices , and the voice I love is whispering in my ear .</l>
       <l n="13">Oh real as in dream all this ; and then a hand on mine is laid :</l>
       <l n="14">The wave of phantom time withdraws ; and that young Babylonian maid ,</l>
       <l n="15">One drop of beauty left behind from all the flowing of that tide ,</l>
       <l n="16">Is looking with the self-same eyes , and here in Ireland by my side .</l>
       <l n="17">Oh , light our life in Babylon , but Babylon has taken wings ,</l>
       <l n="18">While we are in the calm and proud procession of eternal things .</l>
