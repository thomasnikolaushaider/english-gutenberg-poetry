    <head>PREFACE</head>
    <p n="1">New editions of books are a venture for publishers rather than authors . The author has committed his rash act once for all at the beginning and he can hardly retract or repeat it . Nevertheless if I had not connived and collaborated at this selection of verses written ( almost all of them ) in my younger days , they probably would not have reappeared . I therefore owe an apology to my best critics and friends , who have always warned me that I am no poet ; all the more since , in the sense in which they mean the word , I heartily agree with them . Of impassioned tenderness or Dionysiac frenzy I have nothing , nor even of that magic and pregnancy of phrasere — ally the creation of a fresh idiom — which marks the high lights of poetry . Even if my temperament had been naturally warmer , the fact that the English language ( and I can write no other with assurance ) was not my mother-tongue would of itself preclude any inspired use of it on my part ; its roots do not quite reach to my centre . I never drank in in childhood the homely cadences and ditties which in pure spontaneous poetry set the essential key . I know no words redolent of the wonder-world , the fairy-tale , or the cradle . Moreover , I am city-bred , and that companionship with nature , those rural notes , which for English poets are almost inseparable from poetic feeling , fail me altogether . Landscape to me is only a background for fable or a symbol for fate , as it was to the ancients ; and the human scene itself is but a theme for reflection . Nor have I been tempted into the by-ways even of towns , or fascinated by the aspect and humours of all sorts and conditions of men . My approach to language is literary , my images are only metaphors , and sometimes it seems to me that I resemble my countryman Don Quixote , when in his airy flights he was merely perched on a high horse and a wooden Pegasus ; and I ask myself if I ever had anything to say in verse that might not have been said better in prose .</p>
    <p n="2">And yet , in reality , there was no such alternative . What I felt when I composed those verses could not have been rendered in any other form . Their sincerity is absolute , not only in respect to the thought which might be abstracted from them and expressed in prose , but also in respect to the aura of literary and religious associations which envelops them . If their prosody is worn and traditional , like a liturgy , it is because they represent the initiation of a mind into a world older and larger than itself ; not the chance experiences of a stray individual , but his submission to what is not his chance experience ; to the truth of nature and the moral heritage of mankind . Here is the uncertain hand of an apprentice , but of an apprentice in a great school . Verse is one of the traditions of literature . Like the orders of Greek architecture , the sonnet or the couplet or the quatrain are better than anything else that has been devised to serve the same function ; and the innate freedom of poets to hazard new forms does not abolish the freedom of all men to adopt the old ones . It is almost inevitable that a man of letters , if his mind is cultivated and capable of moral concentration , should versify occasionally , or should have versified . He need not on that account pose as a poetic genius , and yet his verses ( like those of Michael Angelo , for instance ) may form a part , even if a subordinate part , of the expression of his mind . Poetry was made for man , not man for poetry , and there are really as many kinds of it as there are poets , or even verses . Is Hamlet 's Soliloquy poetry ? Would it have conveyed its meaning better if not reined in by the metre , and made to prance and turn to the cadences of blank verse ? Whether better or worse , it would certainly not be itself without that movement . Versification is like a pulsing accompaniment , somehow sustaining and exalting the clear logic of the words . The accompaniment may be orchestral , but it is not necessarily worse for being thrummed on a mandolin or a guitar . So the couplets of Pope or Dryden need not be called poetry , but they could not have been prose . They frame in a picture , balanced like the dance . There is an elevation , too , in poetic diction , just because it is consecrated and archaic ; a pomp as of a religious procession , without which certain intuitions would lose all their grace and dignity . Borrowed plumes would not even seem an ornament if they were not in themselves beautiful . To say that what was good once is good no longer is to give too much importance to chronology . Æsthetic fashions may change , losing as much beauty at one end as they gain at the other , but innate taste continues to recognise its affinities , however remote , and need never change . Mask and buskin are often requisite in order to transport what is great in human experience out of its embosoming littleness . They are inseparable from finality , from perception of the ultimate . Perhaps it is just this tragic finality that English poets do not have and do not relish : they feel it to be rhetorical . But verse after all is a form of rhetoric , as is all speech and even thought ; a means of pouring experience into a mould which fluid experience cannot supply , and of transmuting emotion into ideas , by making it articulate .</p>
    <p n="3">In one sense I think that my verses , mental and thin as their texture may be , represent a true inspiration , a true docility . A Muse ? not exactly an English Muse — actually visited me in my isolation ; the same , or a ghost of the same , that visited Boethius or Alfred de Musset or Leopardi . It was literally impossible for me then not to re-echo her eloquence . When that compulsion ceased , I ceased to write verses . My emotion — for there was genuine emotion — faded into a sense that my lesson was learned and my troth plighted ; there was no longer any occasion for this sort of breathlessness and unction . I think the discerning reader will probably prefer the later prose versions of my philosophy ; I prefer them myself , as being more broadly based , saner , more humorous . Yet if he is curious in the matter he may find the same thing here nearer to its fountain-head , in its accidental early setting , and with its most authentic personal note .</p>
    <p n="4">For as to the subject of these poems , it is simply my philosophy in the making . I should not give the title of philosopher to every logician or psychologist who , in his official and studious moments , may weigh argument against argument or may devise expedients for solving theoretical puzzles . I see no reason why a philosopher should be puzzled . What he sees he sees ; of the rest he is ignorant ; and his sense of this vast ignorance ( which is his natural and inevitable condition ) is a chief part of his knowledge and of his emotion . Philosophy is not an optional theme that may occupy him on occasion . It is his only possible life , his daily response to everything . He lives by thinking , and his one perpetual emotion is that this world , with himself in it , should be the strange world which it is . Everything he thinks or utters will accordingly be an integral part of his philosophy , whether it be called poetry or science or criticism . The verses of a philosopher will be essentially epigrams , like those which the Greek sages composed ; they will moralise the spectacle , whether it be some personal passion or some larger aspect of nature .</p>
    <p n="5">My own moral philosophy , especially as expressed in this more sentimental form , may not seem very robust or joyous . Its fortitude and happiness are those of but one type of soul . The owl hooting from his wintry bough cannot be chanticleer crowing in the barnyard , yet he is sacred to Minerva ; and the universal poet , who can sing the humours of winter no less lustily than those of spring , may even speak of his “ merry note , ” worthy to mingle with the other pleasant accidents of the somberer season ,</p>
    <p n="6">When icicles hang by the wall , . . . . . . And coughing drowns the parson 's saw .</p>
    <p n="7">But whether the note seem merry or sad , musical or uncouth , it is itself a note of nature ; and it may at least be commended , seeing it conveys a philosophy , for not conveying it by argument , but frankly making confession of an actual spiritual experience , addressed only to those whose ear it may strike sympathetically and who , crossing the same dark wood on their own errands , may pause for a moment to listen gladly .</p>

       <l n="1">I sought on earth a garden of delight ,</l>
       <l n="2">Or island altar to the Sea and Air ,</l>
       <l n="3">Where gentle music were accounted prayer ,</l>
       <l n="4">And reason , veiled , performed the happy rite .</l>
       <l n="5">My sad youth worshipped at the piteous height</l>
       <l n="6">Where God vouchsafed the death of man to share ;</l>
       <l n="7">His love made mortal sorrow light to bear ,</l>
       <l n="8">But his deep wounds put joy to shamèd flight .</l>
       <l n="9">And though his arms , outstretched upon the tree ,</l>
       <l n="10">Were beautiful , and pleaded my embrace ,</l>
       <l n="11">My sins were loth to look upon his face .</l>
       <l n="12">So came I down from Golgotha to thee ,</l>
       <l n="13">Eternal Mother ; let the sun and sea</l>
       <l n="14">Heal me , and keep me in thy dwelling-place .</l>

        <l n="15">Slow and reluctant was the long descent ,</l>
        <l n="16">With many farewell pious looks behind ,</l>
        <l n="17">And dumb misgivings where the path might wind ,</l>
        <l n="18">And questionings of nature , as I went .</l>
        <l n="19">The greener branches that above me bent ,</l>
        <l n="20">The broadening valleys , quieted my mind ,</l>
        <l n="21">To the fair reasons of the Spring inclined</l>
        <l n="22">And to the Summer 's tender argument .</l>
        <l n="23">But sometimes , as revolving night descended ,</l>
        <l n="24">And in my childish heart the new song ended ,</l>
        <l n="25">I lay down , full of longing , on the steep ;</l>
        <l n="26">And , haunting still the lonely way I wended ,</l>
        <l n="27">Into my dreams the ancient sorrow blended ,</l>
        <l n="28">And with these holy echoes charmed my sleep .</l>

        <l n="36">Was all his science and his only art .</l>
        <l n="37">Our knowledge is a torch of smoky pine</l>

        <l n="39">Across a void of mystery and dread .</l>
        <l n="40">Bid , then , the tender light of faith to shine</l>

       <l n="5">Wide desert where a diadem of towers</l>

     <p>Only in solitude can soliloquies be appreciated , and Mr. Santayana is not an author for loud streets or for them who tear round the country in a blatant char-à-banc . He avoids even the high roads , and we shall come upon him , if we are lucky , in a grassy hollow of the bank of some dark river , and hear him talking to himself in a voice which disturbs neither the dragon-flies nor the thrushes . He meditates by the hour together on the sunlight in the buttercups , which gives him the illusion of life , or on the hurrying flood of liquid agate , which reminds him of the illusion of death . Everything is a symbol to him , and if he has a volume of poetry open at his side he does not distinguish its verse from the puzzling confidences of the blackbirds , and the insects are dreams which mingle with his own . The activity of existence is arrested for him , and time has become a vain expression .</p>
     <p>This is his dominant mood , but sometimes he rouses himself and walks to the wayside inn , where he watches the farmers and the travellers , unobserved by them . He notes their ways and their talk with a shrewd and sometimes humorous pertinacity , but they hardly exist for him more vividly than did the thrushes and the dragon-flies . All are dreams , all are in a condition of maia , and the more he tries to distinguish them the more they melt into one . He exists , and he soliloquises , in a mood of perpetual reverie .</p>
     <p>This is an allegory , and in plain terms Mr. Santayana is a cosmopolitan philosopher of wide reputation . He is the son of a gentleman of Spain , who emigrated to New York . He tells us that his father learned to read English , which implies that he never learned to speak it . The son not only speaks , but writes , our language with an exquisite exactitude and grace , so that he is one of those rare figures , like Mr. Conrad and Mme . Mary Duclaux , who , having adopted in mature years a tongue not theirs by birth , contrive not merely to master but to excel in it . Mr. Santayana was for many years a professor of philosophy in Harvard University , where he showed no mercy to Hegel and was a thorn in the side of the Pragmatists . He is the author of a Life of Reason , in five volumes , which I know that I shall never read , but which I am sure it is safe to recommend to persons younger and more thoughtful than myself . Since he ceased to be a professor , Mr. Santayana has wandered much in Europe , which , distracted as it is , he prefers to America , as quieter . The Great War found him at Oxford , waiting for the spark from heaven and meditating on the importunities of the hour . He stayed there , listening to the whirr of the aeroplanes over Port Meadow , and admiring , perhaps not without envy , the gallant ardour of the youths who started forth so bravely to arrest “ the demons of the whirlwind ” in France and Gallipoli . He stayed in England , because , glancing over the world , he found England pre-eminently the home of decent happiness , even at that desolating hour .</p>
     <p>It is amusing to pick out here and there , and put together in a bunch , some of this Hispano-American philosopher 's impressions of our race , but we make a mistake if we suppose him largely or generally interested in any particular nation . What makes him attractive , but also a little alarming , is his excessive detachment from the modern life in which he moves so silently and observantly . He is not a social essayist , like Montaigne or Charles Lamb or Stevenson . He is almost obtrusively indifferent to whether he has an audience or not . This makes him , in spite of his extreme attention to moral action , a little inhuman . I do not think that he mentions the Scholar Gipsy , but he has a great deal of the spirit which made that hero of Matthew Arnold 's beautiful poem fly the haunts of men . Mr. Santayana will not fly too far ; he will see “ the line of festal light in Christ Church Hall , ” before he turns to the woods and the wilds . But the essence of him is solitary , and he escapes from society not that he may forget it , but that , removed from that element in it which seems to kill the mind , he may reflect upon it with the minimum of disturbance .</p>
     <p>He is anxious to disown the name of metaphysician , but he is a psychologist to the tips of his fingers , and he is still in hopes of discovering a scientific philosophy which may explain to him the apparent discord between man and nature over which he is always brooding . His temper , excessively disturbed by recent events in the political and moral history of the world , may be clearly studied in the very remarkable essay called “ War Shrines , ” and again in “ Tipperary , ” one of the most whimsical and most individual . He started life with a premonition of things noble and tender , and his dreams have often seemed to betray him . But when he has escaped from the fatiguing conventions of life , when he can forget the ugly side of society , his old visions come back to him with smiling eyes , and he can admit that they have kept half their promise .</p>
     <p>We are so well accustomed to attacks , often very petulant and silly , made against England by Englishmen , that it is quite refreshing to read the impressions of a Spanish philosopher trained in America , who has a much higher opinion of us than we are apt to have of ourselves . Mr. Santayana is prompt to protest that nothing would make him wish to become an Englishman . His birthright was settled at his birth , and we feel that there is that kind of patriotism about him which if he had been born a Mongolian would not allow him to waver in his loyalty to Mongolia .</p>
     <p>But he has been a sort of Ulysses , and the result of his wanderings is to make him prefer the Englishman to any other human variety . This is decidedly gratifying , and it will amuse the desultory reader to skim Mr. Santayana 's pages in search of his impressions of our race . They are not given in dogmatic form , but they are found to be consistent , and , as I say , they are gratifying in the mouth of so shrewd and so disinterested an observer . After traversing many lands he concludes that the English character is the best ; it is as strong as the American , and softer , and less obstreperous . He finds the nearest parallel to that old Greek temperament , which he adores , in the English modesty in determination . It seems to rest his spirit to see that we are self-sufficing . Not that he is blind to our national defects , for he thinks that an exquisite or subtle Englishman , although such exist , is a lusus natures . It is not our business to be subtle , and when we are , there is always a tendency in us to become wrong-headed . We turn affected or else puritanical , and these extremes are highly distasteful to Mr. Santayana .</p>
     <p>“ The Englishman travels and conquers without a settled design , because he has the instinct of exploration . His adventures are all external ; they change him so little that he is not afraid of them . He carries his English weather in his heart wherever he goes , and it becomes a cool spot in the desert , and a steady and sane oracle amongst all the deliriums of mankind . Never since the heroic days of Greece has the world had such a sweet , just , boyish master . It will be a black day for the human race when scientific blackguards , conspirators , churls , and fanatics manage to supplant him . ”</p>
     <p>To give a general idea of Mr. Santayana 's essays , I find a difficult task , because of a certain density and uniformity in his expression . He avoids the positive in all its forms . Not merely is he careful not to be dogmatic , but , speaking as he does to and as it were for himself alone , he is apt to combine an exactitude of language with a considerable dilution of thought . He is not averse from the pleasant foible of repeating himself , and as he does this in fresh language the reader , if he is at all censorious , is apt to resent a little the revolving flight of the ideas . Mr. Santayana soliloquises like an aeroplane making graceful curves and daring drops in one section of the ether . His profound scepticism forbids him to alight , for he has no faith in the current assumptions of daily life , and but a very faint interest in facts . He swoops in the light like a swallow , and we must be content to follow his turns and returns , with sympathy for his candour and freshness , and gratitude for his gracious skill . But to define what his object is , though he makes a hundred affirmations of it , is not altogether easy .</p>
