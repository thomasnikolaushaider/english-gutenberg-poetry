     <l n="1">He did not wear his scarlet coat ,</l>

     <l n="4">When they found him with the dead ,</l>
     <l n="5">The poor dead woman whom he loved ,</l>

     <l n="19">I walked , with other souls in pain ,</l>
     <l n="20">Within another ring ,</l>

     <l n="22">A great or little thing ,</l>

     <l n="40">Some with a flattering word ,</l>

     <l n="76">Each new and nerve-twitched pose ,</l>
     <l n="77">Fingering a watch whose little ticks</l>
     <l n="78">Are like horrible hammer-blows .</l>

     <l n="82">Slips through the padded door ,</l>
