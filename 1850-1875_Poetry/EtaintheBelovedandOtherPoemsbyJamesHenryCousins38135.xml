      <head>I</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">Strong in the strength that finds in gentleness</l>
       <l n="2">A way to peace , King Eochaidh on the throne</l>
       <l n="3">Of Erin sits . Around his footstool press</l>
       <l n="4">Clansmen and chiefs . Some wind of thought has blown</l>
       <l n="5">Their eyes to flame . Some purpose , in the stress</l>
       <l n="6">Of travailing tongues , to birth finds not a way :</l>
       <l n="7">What all would utter , none has wit to say .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="8">Into their midst one came , an aged bard</l>
       <l n="9">Upon whose flowing hair Wisdom had laid</l>
       <l n="10">Her gift of silver . On those faces , scarred</l>
       <l n="11">From old forgotten fights , he looked , and weighed</l>
       <l n="12">The meaning in their eyes , though sorely marred ;</l>
       <l n="13">And from the tangled fibre of their thought</l>
       <l n="14">Into the web of speech their purpose wrought .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="15">“ Thy word , O King , has passed by hill and dale</l>
       <l n="16">Throughout all Erin , bidding to the Feast</l>
       <l n="17">Of Tara all thy people , with the tale</l>
       <l n="18">Of tribute due from greatest and from least .</l>
       <l n="19">Nor should this word than others less prevail ,</l>
       <l n="20">But that the herald-spear thy will hath sent ,</l>
       <l n="21">Against the shield of custom has been bent .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="22">“ Thou knowest , O King , that from most ancient years</l>
       <l n="23">No chieftain wifeless rules for thee the land ,</l>
       <l n="24">Nor mateless at a festival appears ;</l>
       <l n="25">But fixed in all experience doth stand :</l>
       <l n="26">And thus , made master of all human fears ,</l>
       <l n="27">Fears not , but strongly round the camp-fires goes ,</l>
       <l n="28">Full sharer of thy people 's joys and woes .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="29">“ Equal in yoke and honour , as the day</l>
       <l n="30">And night , that are but breathings of the soul ,</l>
       <l n="31">They on life 's crooked journey take their way</l>
       <l n="32">Diverse in gift , in essence one and whole .</l>
       <l n="33">This is the custom , King ! Yet custom may ,</l>
       <l n="34">If but of man , be as a smith who twists</l>
       <l n="35">An iron chain to bind upon his wrists .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="36">“ But custom may , if fashioned to the Law</l>
       <l n="37">That made the world , be as the straitened string</l>
       <l n="38">From which the Master of the Feast may draw</l>
       <l n="39">Majestic speech , a living , wondrous thing</l>
       <l n="40">To rid the brow of pale contention 's flaw ,</l>
       <l n="41">And passing like the honey-cup along ,</l>
       <l n="42">Gather their wandering lips to one great song .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="43">“ And such the custom that thy people plead :</l>
       <l n="44">For when of old the deathless Lord of Life</l>
       <l n="45">Dagda came forth , and knew the immortal need</l>
       <l n="46">That burned within his heart , he took to wife</l>
       <l n="47">Dana the Mother of all human seed .</l>
       <l n="48">In her his breath found music and a name .</l>
       <l n="49">In her his fire has blossomed into flame .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="50">“ Throughout the world that fire and music run</l>
       <l n="51">One sings within the maiden 's wondering heart :</l>
       <l n="52">One stirs the veins of manhood , as the sun</l>
       <l n="53">Sets the spring 's fingers thrilling with the smart</l>
       <l n="54">Of keen , ecstatic life that 's but begun .</l>
       <l n="55">In every seed that breaks and wind that blows ,</l>
       <l n="56">Each in the other seeks and finds repose .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="9">
       <l n="57">“ Wherefore , O King , since thou art yet unwed ,</l>
       <l n="58">And thus in kingship standest incomplete ,</l>
       <l n="59">Unfurnished in thy heart , from whence are fed</l>
       <l n="60">The streams of power and wisdom , it is not meet</l>
       <l n="61">That unto thee thy people bow the head ,</l>
       <l n="62">And here thy sovereignty with tribute own</l>
       <l n="63">Till thou hast set a Queen upon thy throne . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="10">
       <l n="64">He ceased , and all the faces of the crowd</l>
       <l n="65">Shone with the light that kindles when the boon</l>
       <l n="66">Of speech has eased the heart ; as when a cloud</l>
       <l n="67">Falls from the labouring shoulder of the moon ,</l>
       <l n="68">And all the world stands smiling silver-browed .</l>
       <l n="69">King Eochaidh for a moment bent his head</l>
       <l n="70">In thought ; then smiling he arose and said :</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="11">
       <l n="71">“ I am not careless of the ancient need</l>
       <l n="72">That moves your minds . Within my own it moves</l>
       <l n="73">Like a long-hidden , unforgotten seed</l>
       <l n="74">The spring has touched uneasily : like hooves</l>
       <l n="75">Long captive , when the trumpet has decreed</l>
       <l n="76">A royal pilgrimage , and in the liss</l>
       <l n="77">They dance to taste the highway 's ringing bliss .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="12">
       <l n="78">“ So have I watched for that sure sign that fills</l>
       <l n="79">The horn of fate , that bending this our realm</l>
       <l n="80">Unto the Will that works behind our wills ,</l>
       <l n="81">It may remain ; as when storms overwhelm ,</l>
       <l n="82">And leafy spray whirls over the roaring hills ,</l>
       <l n="83">The swaying pine bends as the storm wars by ,</l>
       <l n="84">And lives to shake proud arms against the sky .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="13">
       <l n="85">“ But now the horn is full , the hour is here .</l>
       <l n="86">Our wills as one move onward to their end .</l>
       <l n="87">Here now I lift on high the royal spear ,</l>
       <l n="88">And thus through Erin proclamation send :</l>
       <l n="89">‘ Search for the promised maiden far and near</l>
       <l n="90">Whom the high Gods have destined at my side</l>
       <l n="91">To reign . ’ Go forth . The King awaits his bride .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="14">
       <l n="92">“ She shall be found in some most quiet place</l>
       <l n="93">Where Beauty sits all day beside her knee</l>
       <l n="94">And looks with happy envy on her face ;</l>
       <l n="95">Where Virtue blushes , her own guilt to see ,</l>
       <l n="96">And Grace learns new , sweet meanings from her grace ;</l>
       <l n="97">Where all that ever was or will be wise</l>
       <l n="98">Pales at the burning wisdom of her eyes .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="15">
       <l n="99">“ When you at last , far off like worshippers</l>
       <l n="100">Within some holy circle , bow your heads ,</l>
       <l n="101">You shall await till on that face of her 's</l>
       <l n="102">A smile like spring 's first morning slowly spreads ;</l>
       <l n="103">And when her lip with wondrous music stirs ,</l>
       <l n="104">Bear hither like the wind her deathless name ,</l>
       <l n="105">That I may light my heart at its white flame . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="16">
       <l n="106">Scarce had he ceased when from the royal tent</l>
       <l n="107">Broke the full tide of their loud ecstacy ,</l>
       <l n="108">And through the woods like summer thunder went ,</l>
       <l n="109">Full of great rumour of mighty things to be</l>
       <l n="110">That died far off like twilight breezes spent .</l>
       <l n="111">Then sang the bard in hidden wisdom skilled :</l>
       <l n="112">“ Thus is the purpose of the Gods fulfilled .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="17">
       <l n="113">“ Lift now the hands that may not bless</l>
       <l n="114">A wifeless feast , a queenless throne ,</l>
       <l n="115">A court or council womanless ,</l>
       <l n="116">Or life one-limbed and sideways grown ,</l>
       <l n="117">That holds the hands that may not bless .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="18">
       <l n="118">“ The starry Virgin of the east</l>
       <l n="119">Steps up the sky to lead the sign</l>
       <l n="120">Where most has kissed and mixed with least ,</l>
       <l n="121">And one-in-twain life 's torches shine</l>
       <l n="122">Behind the Virgin of the east .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="19">
       <l n="123">“ Then lift the hands that gladly bless</l>
       <l n="124">Full life , to life 's great fulness grown ,</l>
       <l n="125">A power to stand through shock and stress ,</l>
       <l n="126">And rear an everlasting throne</l>
       <l n="127">Held high on hands that gladly bless . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="20">
       <l n="128">Then on a night when on his hearth the gleam</l>
       <l n="129">Of crackling faggots flung a wavering glow</l>
       <l n="130">Along his red-yew roof from beam to beam</l>
       <l n="131">Like glancing eyes , King Eochaidh to and fro</l>
       <l n="132">Turned on his couch , dreaming a happy dream</l>
       <l n="133">Of snapping stems , and crisp leaves crushed by feet</l>
       <l n="134">With high desire made musical and fleet .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="21">
       <l n="135">Out of the fire a swift and slender shaft</l>
       <l n="136">Of yellow flame pierced through the King 's dropped lids ,</l>
       <l n="137">And woke a murmur of bees whose eager craft</l>
       <l n="138">Rifled the treasures of blossomy pyramids ;</l>
       <l n="139">Whereat the King , raising his hand , low laughed ,</l>
       <l n="140">Then passed like some worn swimmer on the sweep</l>
       <l n="141">Of strong waves toward the unfathomed gulf of sleep .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="22">
       <l n="142">At length in that white hour when dewy wings</l>
       <l n="143">Stir with new day 's delight , there came a sound</l>
       <l n="144">As though a passion of voices and smitten strings</l>
       <l n="145">Mingled and swelled and flew along the ground ,</l>
       <l n="146">Till at the utmost of its triumphings ,</l>
       <l n="147">Through the King 's sleep and on his door the dawn</l>
       <l n="148">Broke , and a mighty shout : “ Etain ! Etain ! ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="part" n="1">
       <head>II</head>
       <lg type="stanza" n="23">
        <l n="149">Thereafter , on a morning rich with spring ,</l>
        <l n="150">When round his feet new-opened flowers looked up</l>
        <l n="151">Wide-eyed and wet at some most wondrous thing ,</l>
        <l n="152">And crystal draughts from many an odorous cup</l>
        <l n="153">Were spilled by winds in playful rioting ,</l>
        <l n="154">King Eochaidh stood beside a quiet shore ,</l>
        <l n="155">Dumb with a joy he never knew before .</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="24">
        <l n="156">From league to league alone his path had lain</l>
        <l n="157">On windy hills , through forests dark , or deep</l>
        <l n="158">In dank , sonorous glens . Through every vein</l>
        <l n="159">A burning joy had drunk the mists of sleep ,</l>
        <l n="160">And sung “ Etain , Etain , ” till the refrain</l>
        <l n="161">Irked , and he slept , and when he sprang awake</l>
        <l n="162">Saw that which made his heart with rapture shake .</l>

       <lg type="stanza" n="25">
        <l n="163">There by the sea , Etain his destined bride</l>
        <l n="164">Sat unabashed , unwitting of the sight</l>
        <l n="165">Of him who gazed upon her gleaming side ,</l>
        <l n="166">Fair as the snowfall of a single night ;</l>
        <l n="167">Her arms like foam upon the flowing tide ;</l>
        <l n="168">Her curd-white limbs in all their beauty bare ,</l>
        <l n="169">Straight as the rule of Dagda 's carpenter .</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="26">
        <l n="170">Her cheeks were like the foxglove when it glows</l>
        <l n="171">At noon : her eyes blue as the hyacinth .</l>
        <l n="172">Like moonlight struck to marble , nobly rose</l>
        <l n="173">Her neck upon her shoulder 's polished plinth ;</l>
        <l n="174">And like the light that swiftly comes and goes</l>
        <l n="175">Through breaking waves , among her hair her hands</l>

      <head>HOW THE MOUNTAINS CAME TO BE</head>
       <l n="1">A bird once came and said to me ,</l>
       <l n="2">“ Hear how the mountains came to be .</l>
       <l n="3">An angel from his crystal sphere</l>
       <l n="4">Fell to the earth . A chilly fear</l>
       <l n="5">Shot thro ’ his wings from tip to tip ,</l>
       <l n="6">For there was neither boat nor ship ,</l>
       <l n="7">Mountain nor stream , nor maid nor man ,</l>
       <l n="8">Far as the angel 's eye could scan ;</l>
       <l n="9">Dead flatness far as he could see</l>
       <l n="10">Before the mountains came to be .</l>
       <l n="11">He stretched his wings to fly away ,</l>
       <l n="12">But round his feet the oozy clay</l>
       <l n="13">Gripped fast , and held him to the ground .</l>
       <l n="14">He stretched and strove until a sound</l>
       <l n="15">Went thro ’ him from he knew not where</l>
       <l n="16">And said , ‘ The only way is prayer . ’</l>
       <l n="17">He dropped his wings and raised his eyes ,</l>
       <l n="18">And sent his soul into the skies .</l>
       <l n="19">He prayed and prayed , and as he prayed</l>
       <l n="20">A wind among his plumage played</l>
       <l n="21">And bore him upward toward his sphere .</l>
       <l n="22">Around his feet from far and near</l>
       <l n="23">There came a sound that seemed to say ,</l>
       <l n="24">‘ Pray on ! pray on ! we too would pray .</l>
       <l n="25">Thy prayer has touched the sleeping Powers :</l>
       <l n="26">Pray on , thy prayer shall yet be ours ;</l>
       <l n="27">We too have wings that pine for flight ,</l>
       <l n="28">We too have eyes that long for light . ’</l>
       <l n="29">Upward he moved , and still his eyes</l>
       <l n="30">Were fastened on the distant skies ,</l>
       <l n="31">And as he rose toward heaven dim</l>
       <l n="32">He drew the earth up after him .</l>
       <l n="33">About his feet the oozy clay</l>
       <l n="34">Gripped fast , but could not stop or stay</l>
       <l n="35">His course , till on his skyey stair</l>
       <l n="36">He paused beyond the need for prayer ,</l>
       <l n="37">While from the air beneath , around ,</l>
       <l n="38">There rose a tumult of glad sound .</l>
       <l n="39">The angel turned the sound to seek ,</l>
       <l n="40">And lo ! his foot was on a peak</l>
       <l n="41">That fell away to where the world</l>
       <l n="42">Lay like a painted flag unfurled</l>
       <l n="43">And shaken out from sea to sea ,—</l>
       <l n="44">And thus the mountains came to be . ”</l>
       <l n="45">So said the bird , and what the masque</l>
       <l n="46">Of meaning hid , I meant to ask ;</l>
       <l n="47">But off he flew before I knew —</l>
       <l n="48">And yet I think the tale is true</l>
       <l n="49">If one could only hear aright ,</l>
       <l n="50">And see with something more than sight .</l>

       <l n="3">I raise my Heart 's deep Mether ,</l>
       <l n="4">Where together ,</l>
       <l n="5">Sweetness brought on Fancy 's wing</l>
       <l n="6">From the flowers</l>
       <l n="7">Of happy hours ,</l>
       <l n="8">And a draught from Thought 's cool spring ,</l>
       <l n="9">Blend in song 's melodious ferment ,</l>
       <l n="10">With an undertone</l>
       <l n="11">Caught in deeper hours alone ,</l>
       <l n="12">When along Life 's solemn harp the Spirit 's air went .</l>

    <head>NOTES</head>
    <p n="1">Etain the Beloved :— This poem is founded on an ancient Irish myth . It is not a translation from the Gaelic ; but rather is an attempt at transfiguration , by seeking to “ unfold into light ” the spiritual vision that was the inspiration , and is the secret of the persistence and resilience , of the Celt . Such modifications as I have made in the story have neither archaeological nor philological significance : they arise entirely from whatever measure of insight into artistic necessity , on the side of pure literature , has been granted to me ; and also from obedience to a view of the universe which is embodied in the ancient Irish mythology , and whose operations the personages of the story body forth as Psyche bodied forth the soul of humanity to the Greek .</p>
    <p n="2">The names of the personages may be pronounced thus : Etain — Etawn ’ , Eochaidh — Yo'hee , Ailill — Al'yil , Mider — Mid'yir .</p>
    <p n="3">Dagda is the Irish God of Day , Balor the Irish God of Night .</p>
    <p n="4">A dun is a fortified dwelling , a liss is a place for domestic animals .</p>
    <p n="5">Death and Life :— On Friday , August 13 , 1909 , the author went by currach from Dunquin to the Great Blasket Island , Kerry , to visit Miss Eveleen Nicolls , M. A ., who was spending a holiday on the island . Instead of joining her , as was intended , in music and conversation amongst the islanders , he had to participate in an endeavour , alas ! unsuccessful , to restore her to life . She had been bathing with a fisher-girl . The latter got into difficulties in the strong Atlantic current , and an effort by Miss Nicolls to save the girl ended in the heroic sacrifice of her own life .</p>
    <p n="6">A Schoolboy plays Cuchulain :— Cuchulain , the supreme hero of Celtic romance , who , single-handed , defended his province against the army of Queen Maeve . Maeve had chosen for a foray the time when the Ulster chiefs lay in weakness under a curse by the warrior Goddess , Macha .</p>
    <p n="7">Hospitality : The Student :— Put into verse from the literal translations of Kuno Meyer in “ Ancient Irish Poetry . ”</p>
    <p n="8">To One in Prison : A Home-coming :— Occasioned by the imprisonment of the author 's wife for taking part in the active movement for the political enfranchisement of women .</p>
