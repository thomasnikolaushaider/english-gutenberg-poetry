    <head>INTRODUCTION</head>
    <p n="1">PARODY AS A FINE ART</p>
    <p n="2">THE fact that parody has been ably defended by many of the world 's best minds proves that it is an offensive measure , at least from some viewpoints . But an analysis of the arguments for and against seems to show that parody is a true and legitimate branch of art , whose appreciation depends upon the mental bias of the individual .</p>
    <p n="3">To enjoy parody , one must have an intense sense of the humorous and a humorous sense of the intense ; and this , of course , presupposes a mental attitude of wide tolerance and liberal judgments .</p>
    <p n="4">Parodies are not for those who cannot understand that parody is not necessarily ridicule . Like most other forms of literature , unless the intent of the writer be thoroughly understood and appreciated , the work is of little value to the reader .</p>
    <p n="5">The defenders of parody have sometimes endeavored to prove that it has an instructive value , and that it has acted as a reforming influence against mannerisms and other glaring defects . One enthusiastic partisan confidently remarks : “ It may gently admonish the best and most established writer , when , from haste , from carelessness , from over-confidence , he is in danger of forfeiting his reputation ; it may gently lead the tyro , while there is yet time , from the wrong into the right path . ” But this ethical air-castle is rudely shattered by facts , for what established writer ever changed his characteristic effects as a result of the parodies upon his works , or what tyro was ever parodied ?</p>
    <p n="6">It has been said , too , that a good parody makes us love the original work better ; but this statement seems to lack satisfactory proof except , perhaps , on the principle that a good parody may lead us to know the original work more thoroughly .</p>
    <p n="7">Perhaps the farthest fetched argument of the zealous advocates of the moral virtues of parody is found in Lord Jeffrey 's review of the well-known “ Rejected Addresses , ” where he says , “ The imitation lets us more completely into the secret of the original author , and enables us to understand far more clearly in what the peculiarity of his manner consists than most of us would ever have done without this assistance . ” If this be true at all , it is exemplified in very few instances , and is one of the least of the minor reasons for the existence of a parody .</p>
    <p n="8">The main intent of the vast majority of parodies is simply to amuse ; but to amuse intelligently and cleverly . This aim is quite high enough , and is in no way strengthened or improved by the bolstering up qualities of avowed virtuous influences .</p>
    <p n="9">The requirements of the best parody are in a general way simply the requirements of the best literature of any sort ; but , specifically , the true parodist requires an exact mental balance , a fine sense of proportion and relative values , good-humor , refinement , and unerring taste . Self-control and self-restraint are also needed ; a parodist may go to the very edge , but he must not fall over .</p>
    <p n="10">The fact that poor parodies outnumber the good ones in the ratio of about ten to one ( which is not an unusual percentage in any branch of literature ) , is because a wide and generous sense of humor is so rarely found in combination with the somewhat circumscribed quality of good taste . It is , therefore , on account of the abuse of parody , and not the use of it , that a defence of the art has been found necessary .</p>
    <p n="11">The parody has the sanction of antiquity , and though its absolute origin is uncertain , and various “ Fathers of Parody ” have been named , it is safe to assume that it began with the Greeks . The Romans , too , indulged in it , and its continuance has been traced all through the Middle Ages ; but these ancient parodies , however acceptable in their time , are of little interest to us now , save as heirlooms . Their wit is coarse , their humor heavy ; they are usually caustic and often irreverent .</p>
    <p n="12">In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries the art of parody began to improve , and during the nineteenth it rose to a height that demanded recognition from the literary world .</p>
    <p n="13">It is interesting to note that the age of English parody was ushered in by such masterpieces as the “ Rolliad ” and the “ Anti-Jacobin , ” followed by the “ Rejected Addresses ” and the “ Bon Gaultier Ballads . ” Later came Thackeray , Calverley , Swinburne and Lewis Carroll , also Bayard Taylor , Bret Harte , and Phoebe Cary . More modern still is the work of Rudyard Kipling , Anthony C. Deane , H. C. Bunner , and Owen Seaman .</p>
    <p n="14">Though some of these are classed among the minor poets , they are all major parodists and approach their work armed at all points .</p>
    <p n="15">The casual critic of parodies , as a rule , divides them into two classes , which , though under various forms of terminology , resolve themselves into parodies of sound and parodies of sense . But there are really three great divisions , which may be called “ word-rendering , ” “ form-rendering , ” and “ sense-rendering . ”</p>
    <p n="16">The first , mere word-rendering , is simply an imitation of the original , and depends for its interest entirely upon the substitution of a trivial or commonplace motive for a lofty one , and following as nearly as possible the original words .</p>
    <p n="17">Form-rendering is the imitation of the style of an author , preferably an author given to mannerisms or affectation of some sort . The third division , sense-rendering , is by far the most meritorious , and utilizes not only the original writer 's diction and style , but follows a train of thought precisely along the lines that he would have pursued from the given premises .</p>
    <p n="18">This class of parody is seen at its best in Catherine Fanshawe 's “ Imitation of Wordsworth , ” and Calverley 's “ The Cock and the Bull . ”</p>
    <p n="19">But though parodies of this sort are of more serious worth , the other classes show examples quite as good in their own way .</p>
    <p n="20">Lewis Carroll 's immortal parody of Southey 's “ Father William ” is merely a burlesque of the word-rendering type , yet it is perfect of its kind and defies adverse criticism .</p>
    <p n="21">Miss Cary was a pioneer of parody in America and one of the few women writers who have done clever work of this sort . Miss Cary 's parodies are numerous and uniformly first-class examples of their kind . They are collected in a small book , now out of print , and are well worth reading .</p>
    <p n="22">Of course , parodies which burlesque the actual words of the original are necessarily parodies of some particular poem , and often not so good an imitation of the style of the author .</p>
    <p n="23">More difficult than the parody of a particular poem is the imitation or burlesque of the literary style of an author . To accomplish this , the parodist must be himself a master of style , a student of language , and possessed of a power of mimicry with an instant appreciation of opportunities .</p>
    <p n="24">“ Diversions of the Echo Club , ” by Bayard Taylor , are among the best of this class of parodies . Aside from their cleverness they are marked by good taste , fairness , justice , and a true poetic instinct .</p>
    <p n="25">Naturally , parodies of literary style are founded on the works of those authors whose individual characteristics invite imitation .</p>
    <p n="26">Parody is inevitable where sense is sacrificed to sound , where affectations of speech are evident , or where unwarrantable extravagance of any sort is indulged in . This explains the numerous ( and usually worthless ) parodies of Walt Whitman .</p>
    <p n="27">Swinburne and Browning are often parodied for these ( perhaps only apparent ) reasons , and the poets of the aesthetic school of course offered especially fine opportunities .</p>
    <p n="28">Parodies of Rossetti and his followers are often exceedingly funny , though not at all difficult to write , as the originals both in manner and matter fairly invite absurd incongruities .</p>
    <p n="29">Nursery Rhymes seem to find favor with the parodists as themes to work upon . A collection of Mother Goose 's Melodies as they have been reset by clever pens , would be both large and interesting .</p>
    <p n="30">The masters of parody , however , are as a rule to be found among the master poets . Thackeray turned his genius to imitative account ; Swinburne parodied himself as well as his fellow-poets ; Rudyard Kipling has done some of the best parodies in the language , and C. S. Calverley 's burlesques are classics . The work of these writers may be said to be in the third class ; for not only do they preserve the diction and style of the author imitated , but they seem to go beyond that , and , assimilating for the moment his very mentality , caricature not only his expressed thoughts but his abstract cerebrations .</p>
    <p n="31">It is easy to understand how Swinburne with his facile fancy and wonderful command of words could be among the best parodists . In his “ Heptalogia ” are long and careful parodies of no less than seven prominent poets , each of which is a masterpiece , and the parody of Browning is especially good . Browning , of course , has always been a tempting mark for the parodists , but though it is easy to imitate his eccentricities superficially , it is only the greater minds that have parodied his subtler peculiarities . Among the best are Calverley 's and Kipling 's .</p>
    <p n="32">Kipling 's parodies , written in his early days , and not often to be found in editions of his collected works , rank with the highest . His parody of Swinburne , while going to the very limit of legitimate imitation , is restrained by a powerful hand , and so kept within convincing bounds . The great fault with most parodies of Swinburne is that exaggeration is given play too freely , and the result is merely a meaningless mass of sound . Clever in a different way is Owen Seaman 's parody of Swinburne . Mr . Seaman is one of the most brilliant of modern parodists and his parodies , though long , are perfect in all respects .</p>
    <p n="33">Among the most exquisite parodies we have ever read must be counted those of Anthony C. Deane , originally published in various London papers , and Calverley 's works are too well known even to require mention .</p>
    <p n="34">The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam is often parodied , but rarely worthily . One reason for this lies in the fact that it is not Omar who is parodied at all , but Fitzgerald ; consequently , the imitation is merely a form-rendering and more often only lines in the Rubaiyat metre .</p>
    <p n="35">Shakespeare , with the exception of one or two of his most hackneyed speeches , is rarely parodied ; doubtless owing to the fact that his harmonious work shows no incongruities of matter or manner , and strikes no false notes for the parodists to catch at .</p>
    <p n="36">The extent of the domain of parody is vastly larger than is imagined by the average reader , and its already published bibliographies show thousands of collected parodies of varying degrees of merit .</p>
    <p n="37">Of all the poets Tennyson has probably been parodied the most ; followed closely in this respect by Edgar Allan Poe . After these , Browning , Swinburne , and Walt Whitman ; then Moore , Wordsworth , Longfellow , and Thomas Campbell .</p>
    <p n="38">Of single poems the one showing the greatest number of parodies is “ My Mother , ” by Ann Taylor ; after this those most used for the purpose have been “ The Raven , ” Gray 's “ Elegy , ” “ The Song of the Shirt , ” “ The May Queen , ” “ Locksley Hall , ” “ The Burial of Sir John Moore , ” and Kingsley 's “ Three Fishers . ”</p>
    <p n="39">Parody , then , is a tribute to popularity , and consequently to merit of one sort or another , and in the hands of the initiate may be considered a touch-stone that proves true worth .</p>

     <l n="1">WAKE ! for the sun has driven in equal flight</l>
     <l n="2">The stars before him from the Tee of Night ,</l>
     <l n="3">And holed them every one without a Miss ,</l>
     <l n="4">Swinging at ease his gold-shod Shaft of Light .</l>

     <l n="5">Now , the fresh Year reviving old Desires ,</l>
     <l n="6">The thoughtful Soul to Solitude retires ,</l>
     <l n="7">Pores on this Club and That with anxious eye ,</l>
     <l n="8">And dreams of Rounds beyond the Rounds of Liars .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">Come , choose your Ball , and in the fire of Spring ,</l>
     <l n="10">Your Red Coat and your wooden Putter fling ;</l>
     <l n="11">The Club of Time has but a little while</l>
     <l n="12">To waggle , and the Club is on the swing .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">A Bag of Clubs , a Silver Town or two ,</l>
     <l n="14">A Flask of Scotch , a Pipe of Shag , and Thou</l>
     <l n="15">Beside me caddying in the Wilderness —</l>
     <l n="16">Ah , Wilderness were Paradise enow .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="17">Myself , when young , did eagerly frequent</l>
     <l n="18">Jamie and His , and heard great argument</l>
     <l n="19">Of Grip , and Stance , and Swing ; but evermore</l>
     <l n="20">Found at the Exit but a Dollar spent .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="21">With them the seed of Wisdom did I sow ,</l>
     <l n="22">And with mine own hand sought to make it grow ;</l>
     <l n="23">And this was all the Harvest that I reap 'd ;</l>
     <l n="24">“ You hold it in this Way , and you swing it So . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="25">The swinging Brassie strikes ; and , having struck ,</l>
     <l n="26">Moves on ; nor all your Wit or future Luck</l>
     <l n="27">Shall lure it back to cancel half a Stroke ,</l>
     <l n="28">Nor from the Card a single Seven pluck .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="29">No hope by Club or Ball to win the Prize ;</l>
     <l n="30">The batter 'd , blacken 'd Remade sweetly flies ,</l>
     <l n="31">Swept cleanly from the Tee ; this is the Truth</l>
     <l n="32">Nine-tenths is Skill , and all the rest is Lies .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="33">And that inverted Ball they call the High ,</l>
     <l n="34">By which the Duffer thinks to live or die ,</l>
     <l n="35">Lift not your hands to It for help , for it</l>
     <l n="36">As impotently froths as you or I .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="37">Yon rising Moon that leads us home again ,</l>
     <l n="38">How oft hereafter will she wax and wane ;</l>
     <l n="39">How oft hereafter rising , wait for us</l>
     <l n="40">At this same Turning — and for One in vain .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="41">And when , like her , my Golfer , I have been</l>
     <l n="42">And am no more above the pleasant Green ,</l>
     <l n="43">And you in your mild Journey pass the Hole</l>

     <l n="25">I sometimes think that never lasts so long</l>

     <l n="13">Nor yet so large that it might fare</l>

     <l n="18">Of all her gear disburdened ,</l>
     <l n="19">This ring at least she shall not doff</l>

    <head>AN IDYLL OF PHATTE AND LEENE</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">THE hale John Sprat — oft called for shortness , Jack —</l>
     <l n="2">Had married — had , in fact , a wife — and she</l>
     <l n="3">Did worship him with wifely reverence .</l>
     <l n="4">He , who had loved her when she was a girl ,</l>
     <l n="5">Compass 'd her , too , with sweet observances ;</l>
     <l n="6">E'en at the dinner table did it shine .</l>
     <l n="7">For he — liking no fat himself — he never did ,</l>
     <l n="8">With jealous care piled up her plate with lean ,</l>
     <l n="9">Not knowing that all lean was hateful to her .</l>
     <l n="10">And day by day she thought to tell him o ‘ t ,</l>
     <l n="11">And watched the fat go out with envious eye ,</l>
     <l n="12">But could not speak for bashful delicacy .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="13">At last it chanced that on a winter day ,</l>
     <l n="14">The beef — a prize joint !— little was but fat ;</l>
     <l n="15">So fat , that John had all his work cut out ,</l>
     <l n="16">To snip out lean fragments for his wife ,</l>
     <l n="17">Leaving , in very sooth , none for himself ;</l>
     <l n="18">Which seeing , she spoke courage to her soul ,</l>
     <l n="19">Took up her fork , and , pointing to the joint</l>
     <l n="20">Where ‘ twas the fattest , piteously she said ;</l>
     <l n="21">“ Oh , husband ! full of love and tenderness !</l>
     <l n="22">What is the cause that you so jealously</l>
     <l n="23">Pick out the lean for me . I like it not !</l>
     <l n="24">Nay , loathe it — ‘ tis on the fat that I would feast ;</l>
     <l n="25">O me , I fear you do not like my taste ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="26">Then he , dropping his horny-handled carving knife ,</l>
     <l n="27">Sprinkling therewith the gravy o'er her gown ,</l>
     <l n="28">Answer 'd , amazed : “ What ! you like fat , my wife !</l>
     <l n="29">And never told me . Oh , this is not kind !</l>
     <l n="30">Think what your reticence has wrought for us ;</l>
     <l n="31">How all the fat sent down unto the maid —</l>
     <l n="32">Who likes not fat — for such maids never do —</l>
     <l n="33">Has been put in the waste-tub , sold for grease ,</l>
     <l n="34">And pocketed as servant 's perquisite !</l>
     <l n="35">Oh , wife ! this news is good ; for since , perforce ,</l>
     <l n="36">A joint must be not fat nor lean , but both ;</l>
     <l n="37">Our different tastes will serve our purpose well ;</l>
     <l n="38">For , while you eat the fat — the lean to me</l>
     <l n="39">Falls as my cherished portion . Lo ! ‘ tis good ! ”</l>
     <l n="40">So henceforth — he that tells the tale relates —</l>
     <l n="41">In John Sprat 's household waste was quite unknown ;</l>
     <l n="42">For he the lean did eat , and she the fat ,</l>
     <l n="43">And thus the dinner-platter was all cleared .</l>

     <l n="3">See the rush upon the pay-hole —</l>
     <l n="4">People stand a night and day whole</l>
     <l n="5">To secure a little corner for The Bells !</l>
     <l n="6">To look ghastly pale and shudder , every man and “ every brudder ”</l>

     <l n="29">Will the scene be now repeated which in London always greeted</l>

     <l n="36">But if there are detractors</l>

    <head>SIR EGGNOGG</head>
     <l n="1">FORTH from the purple battlements he fared ,</l>
     <l n="2">Sir Eggnogg of the Rampant Lily , named</l>
     <l n="3">From that embrasure of his argent shield</l>
     <l n="4">Given by a thousand leagues of heraldry</l>
     <l n="5">On snuffy parchments drawn . So forth he fared ,</l>
     <l n="6">By bosky boles and autumn leaves he fared ,</l>
     <l n="7">Where grew the juniper with berries black ,</l>
     <l n="8">The sphery mansions of the future gin .</l>
     <l n="9">But naught of this decoyed his mind , so bent</l>
     <l n="10">On fair Miasma , Saxon-blooded girl ,</l>
     <l n="11">Who laughed his loving lullabies to scorn ,</l>
     <l n="12">And would have snatched his hero-sword to deck</l>
     <l n="13">Her haughty brow , or warm her hands withal ,</l>
     <l n="14">So scornful she ; and thence Sir Eggnogg cursed</l>
     <l n="15">Between his teeth , and chewed his iron boots</l>
     <l n="16">In spleen of love . But ere the morn was high</l>
     <l n="17">In the robustious heaven , the postern-tower</l>
     <l n="18">Clang to the harsh , discordant , slivering scream</l>
     <l n="19">Of the tire-woman , at the window bent</l>
     <l n="20">To dress her crisped hair . She saw , ah , woe !</l>
     <l n="21">The fair Miasma , overbalanced , hurled</l>
     <l n="22">O'er the flamboyant parapet which ridged</l>
     <l n="23">The muffled coping of the castle 's peak ,</l>
     <l n="24">Prone on the ivory pavement of the court ,</l>
     <l n="25">Which caught and cleft her fairest skull , and sent</l>
     <l n="26">Her rosy brains to fleck the Orient floor .</l>
     <l n="27">This saw Sir Eggnogg , in his stirrups poised .</l>
     <l n="28">Saw he and cursed , with many a deep-mouthed oath ,</l>
     <l n="29">And , finding nothing more could reunite</l>
     <l n="30">The splintered form of fair Miasma , rode</l>
     <l n="31">On his careering palfrey to the wars ,</l>
     <l n="32">And there found death , another death than hers .</l>

   <p>Notes .— Lines 1 and 2 .— See Guthrie 's Geography . The site of Timbuctoo is doubtful ; the author has neatly expressed this in the poem , at the same time giving us some slight hints relative to its situation .</p>
   <p>Line 5 .— So Horace : leonum arida nutrix .</p>
   <p>Line 13 .— “ Pop goes the musketoons . ” A learned friend suggested “ Bang ” as a stronger expression , but as African gunpowder is notoriously bad , the author thought “ Pop ” the better word .</p>
   <p>Lines 15-18 .— A concise but affecting description is here given of the domestic habits of the people . The infamous manner in which they are entrapped and sold as slaves is described , and the whole ends with an appropriate moral sentiment . The enthusiasm the author feels is beautifully expressed in lines 25 and 26 .</p>

    <head>IMITATION OF WALT WHITMAN</head>
     <l n="1">WHO am I ?</l>
     <l n="2">I have been reading Walt Whitman , and know not whether he be me , or</l>
     <l n="3">me he ;—</l>
     <l n="4">Or otherwise !</l>
     <l n="5">Oh , blue skies ! oh , rugged mountains ! oh , mighty , rolling Niagara !</l>
     <l n="6">Oh , chaos and everlasting bosh !</l>
     <l n="7">I am a poet ; I swear it ! If you do not believe it you are a dolt , a</l>
     <l n="8">fool , an idiot !</l>
     <l n="9">Milton , Shakespere , Dante , Tommy Moore , Pope , never , but Byron , too ,</l>
     <l n="10">perhaps , and last , not least , Me , and the Poet Close .</l>
     <l n="11">We send our resonance echoing down the adamantine canyons of the</l>
     <l n="12">future !</l>
     <l n="13">We live forever ! The worms who criticise us ( asses ! ) laugh , scoff ,</l>
     <l n="14">jeer , and babble babble — die !</l>
     <l n="15">Serve them right .</l>
     <l n="16">What is the difference between Judy , the pride of Fleet Street , the</l>
     <l n="17">glory of Shoe Lane , and Walt Whitman ?</l>
     <l n="18">Start not ! ‘ Tis no end of a minstrel show who perpends this query ;</l>
     <l n="19">‘ Tis no brain-racking puzzle from an inner page of the Family Herald ,</l>
     <l n="20">No charade , acrostic ( double or single ) , conundrum , riddle , rebus ,</l>
     <l n="21">anagram , or other guess-work .</l>
     <l n="22">I answer thus : We both write truths — great , stern , solemn ,</l>
     <l n="23">unquenchable truths — couched in more or less ridiculous</l>
     <l n="24">language .</l>
     <l n="25">I , as a rule use rhyme , he does not ; therefore , I am his Superior</l>
     <l n="26">( which is also a lake in his great and glorious country ) .</l>
     <l n="27">I scorn , with the unutterable scorn of the despiser of pettiness , to</l>
     <l n="28">take a mean advantage of him .</l>
     <l n="29">He writes , he sells , he is read ( more or less ) ; why then should I</l>
     <l n="30">rack my brains and my rhyming dictionary ? I will see the public</l>
     <l n="31">hanged first !</l>
     <l n="32">I sing of America , of the United States , of the stars and stripes of</l>
     <l n="33">Oshkosh , of Kalamazoo , and of Salt Lake City .</l>
     <l n="34">I sing of the railroad cars , of the hotels , of the breakfasts , the</l>
     <l n="35">lunches , the dinners , and the suppers ;</l>
     <l n="36">Of the soup , the fish , the entrees , the joints , the game , the puddings</l>
     <l n="37">and the ice-cream .</l>
     <l n="38">I sing all — I eat all — I sing in turn of Dr. Bluffem 's Antibilious</l>
     <l n="39">Pills .</l>
     <l n="40">No subject is too small , too insignificant , for Nature 's poet .</l>
     <l n="41">I sing of the cocktail , a new song for every cocktail , hundreds of</l>
     <l n="42">songs , hundreds of cocktails .</l>
     <l n="43">It is a great and a glorious land ! The Mississippi , the Missouri ,</l>
     <l n="44">and a million other torrents roll their waters to the ocean .</l>
     <l n="45">It is a great and glorious land ! The Alleghanies , the Catskills , the</l>
     <l n="46">Rockies ( see atlas for other mountain ranges too numerous to</l>
     <l n="47">mention ) pierce the clouds !</l>
     <l n="48">And the greatest and most glorious product of this great and glorious</l>
     <l n="49">land is Walt Whitman ;</l>
     <l n="50">This must be so , for he says it himself .</l>
     <l n="51">There is but one greater than he between the rising and the setting</l>
     <l n="52">sun .</l>
     <l n="53">There is but one before whom he meekly bows his humbled head .</l>
     <l n="54">Oh , great and glorious land , teeming producer of all things , creator</l>
     <l n="55">of Niagara , and inventor of Walt Whitman ,</l>
     <l n="56">Erase your national advertisements of liver pads and cures for</l>

   <note>POSTSCRIPT Then blame me not , altho ’ my verse Sounds like an echo of C. S. C. Since still they make ballads that worse and worse Savor of diddle and hey-de-dee . Anonymous . A MAUDLE-IN BALLAD ( To his Lily ) MY lank limp lily , my long lithe lily , My languid lily-love fragile and thin , With dank leaves dangling and flower-flap chilly , That shines like the shin of a Highland gilly ! Mottled and moist as a cold toad 's skin ! Lustrous and leper-white , splendid and splay ! Art thou not Utter and wholly akin To my own wan soul and my own wan chin , And my own wan nose-tip , tilted to sway The peacock 's feather , sweeter than sin , That I bought for a halfpenny yesterday ? My long lithe lily , my languid lily , My lank limp lily-love , how shall I win — Woo thee to wink at me ? Silver lily , How shall I sing to thee , softly or shrilly ? What shall I weave for thee — what shall I spin — Rondel , or rondeau , or virelai ? Shall I buzz like a bee with my face thrust in Thy choice , chaste chalice , or choose me a tin Trumpet , or touchingly , tenderly play On the weird bird-whistle , sweeter than sin , That I bought for a halfpenny yesterday . My languid lily , my lank limp lily , My long lithe lily-love , men may grin — Say that I 'm soft and supremely silly — What care I while you whisper stilly ; What care I while you smile ? Not a pin ! While you smile , you whisper — ‘ Tis sweet to decay ? I have watered with chlorodine , tears of chagrin , The churchyard mould I have planted thee in , Upside down in an intense way , In a rough red flower-pot , sweeter than sin , That I bought for a halfpenny yesterday . Punch . QUITE THE CHEESE ( By a Wilde AEsthete ) THERE was once a maiden who loved a cheese ; Sing , hey ! potatoes and paint ! She could eat a pound and a half with ease Oh , the odorous air was faint ! What was the cheese that she loved the best ? Sing , hey , red pepper and rags ! You will find it out if you read the rest ; Oh , the horrors of frowning crags ! Came lovers to woo her from every land — Sing , hey ! fried bacon and files ! They asked for her heart , but they meant her hand , Oh , the joy of the Happy Isles . A haughty old Don from Oporto came ; Sing , hey ! new carrots and nails ! The Duke of GORGONZOLA , his famous name , Oh , the lusciously-scented gales ! Lord STILTON belonged to a mighty line ! Sing , hey ! salt herrings and stones ! He was “ Blue ” as chine — his taste divine ! Oh , the sweetness of dulcet tones . Came stout DOUBLE GLO'STER — a man and wife , Sing , hey ! post pillars and pies ! And the son was SINGLE , and fair as fate ; Oh , the purple of sunset skies ! DE CAMEMBERT came from his sunny France , Sing , hey ! pork cutlets and pearls ! He would talk sweet nothings , and sing and dance , Oh , the sighs of the soft sweet girls . Came GRUYERE so pale ! a most hole-y man ! Sing , hey ! red sandstone and rice ! But the world saw through him as worldings can , Oh , the breezes from Isles of Spice . But the maiden fair loved no cheese but one ! Sing , hey ! acrostics and ale ! Save for SINGLE GLO'STER she love had none ! Oh , the roses on fair cheeks pale ! He was fair and single — and so was she ! Sing , hey ! tomatoes and tar ! And so now you know which it is to be ! Oh , the aid of a lucky star ! They toasted the couple the livelong night , Sing , hey ! cast iron and carp ! And engaged a poet this song to write . Oh , the breathing AEolian harp ! So he wrote this ballad at vast expense ! Sing , hey ! pump-handles and peas ! And , though you may think it devoid of sense , Oh , he fancies it QUITE THE CHEESE ! H. C. Waring . AFTER WILLIAM WATSON THE THREE MICE THREE mice — three sightless mice — averse from strife , Peaceful descendants of the Armenian race , Intent on finding some secluded place Wherein to pass their inoffensive life ; How little dreamt they of that farmer 's wife — The Porte 's malicious minion — giving chase , And in a moment — ah , the foul disgrace !— Shearing their tails off with a carving-knife ! And oh , my unemotional countrymen , Who choose to dally and to temporize , When once before with vitriolic pen I told the tale of Turkish infamies , Once more I call to vengeance ,— now as then , Shouting the magic word “ Atrocities ! ” Anthony C. Deane . AFTER KIPLING FUZZY WUZZY LEAVES US We 've been visited by men across the seas , And some of them could write , and some could not ; The English , French , and German — whom you please , But Kipling was the finest of the lot . In sooth , we 're loath to lose him from our list ; Though he 's not been wholly kind in all his dealings ; Indeed from first to last I must insist , He has played the cat and banjo with our feelings . But here 's to you , Mr. Kipling , with your comments and your slurs ; You 're a poor , benighted Briton , but the Prince of Raconteurs ! We 'll give you your certificate , and if you want it signed , Come back and have a fling at us whenever you 're inclined ! You harrowed us with murder and with blood ; You dipped us deep in Simla 's petty guile ; Yet we have found ourselves misunderstood When we served you a sensation in our style ; And though you saw some grewsome pictures through The Windy City 's magnifying lens , Yet we took it just a little hard of you , A-objecting to the slaughter of our pens ! But here 's to you , Mr. Kipling , and the boys of Lung-tung-pen , And all we have to ask you is , make ‘ em kill again ! For though we 're crude in some things here , which fact I much deplore , We know genius when we see it , and we 're not afraid of gore . And yet we love you best on Greenough Hill , By Bisesa and her sisters dark perplext ; In your sermons , which have power to lift and thrill Just because they have the heart of man as text ; And when you bend , the little ones to please , With Bagheera and Baloo at hide and seek , Oh ! a happy hour with Mowgli in the trees Sets a little chap a-dreaming for a week . So , here 's to you , Mr. Kipling , and to Mowgli and Old Kaa , And to her who loved and waited where the Gates of Sorrow are ; For where is brush more potent to paint since Art began The white love of a Woman and the red blood of a Man . So , since to us you 've given such delight , We hope that you wo n't think us quite so bad . You 're all hot sand and ginger , when you write , But we 're sure you 're only shamming when you 're mad . Yet so you leave us Gunga Din 's salaam , So you incarnate Mulvaney on a spree ; Mr. Kipling , sir , we do not “ care a damn ” For the comments you may make on such as we ! Then here 's to you , Mr. Kipling , and Columbia avers You 're a poor , benighted Briton , but the Prince of Raconteurs . You may scathe us , and may leave us ; still in our hearts will stay The man who made Mulvaney and the road to Mandalay . E. P. C. A BALLAD ( In the manner of R-dy-rd K-pl-ng ) AS I was walkin ’ the jungle round , a-killin ’ of tigers an ’ time ; I seed a kind of an author man a writin ’ a rousin ’ rhyme ; ‘ E was writin ’ a mile a minute an ’ more , an ’ I sez to ‘ im , “ ‘ Oo are you ? ” Sez ‘ e , “ I 'm a poet — ‘ er majesty 's poet — soldier an ’ sailor , too ! ” An ‘ is poem began in Ispahan an ’ ended in Kalamazoo , It ‘ ad army in it , an ’ navy in it , an ’ jungle sprinkled through , For ‘ e was a poet — ‘ er majesty 's poet — soldier an ’ sailor , too !

Guy Wetmore Carryl . JACK AND JILL HERE is the tale — and you must make the most of it ! Here is the rhyme — ah , listen and attend ! Backwards — forwards — read it all and boast of it If you are anything the wiser at the end ! Now Jack looked up — it was time to sup , and the bucket was yet to fill ; And Jack looked round for a space and frowned , then beckoned his sister Jill , And twice he pulled his sister 's hair , and thrice he smote her side ; “ Ha ’ done , ha ’ done with your impudent fun — ha ’ done , with your games ! ” she cried ; “ You have made mud-pies of a marvellous size — finger and face are black , You have trodden the Way of the Mire and Clay — now up and wash you , Jack ! Or else , or ever we reach our home , there waiteth an angry dame — Well you know the weight of her blow — the supperless open shame ! Wash , if you will , on yonder hill — wash if you will , at the spring ,— Or keep your dirt , to your certain hurt , and an imminent walloping ! ” “ You must wash — you must scrub — you must scrape ! ” growled Jack , “ you must traffic with can and pails , Nor keep the spoil of the good brown soil in the rim of your fingernails ! The morning path you must tread to your bath — you must wash ere the night descends , And all for the cause of conventional laws and the soapmaker 's dividends ! But if ‘ t is sooth that our meal in truth depends on our washing , Jill , By the sacred right of our appetite — haste — haste to the top of the hill ! ” They have trodden the Way of the Mire and Clay , they have toiled and travelled far , They have climbed to the brow of the hill-top now , where the bubbling fountains are , They have taken the bucket and filled it up — yea , filled it up to the brim ; But Jack he sneered at his sister Jill , and Jill she jeered at him : “ What , blown already ! ” Jack cried out ( and his was a biting mirth ! ) “ You boast indeed of your wonderful speed — but what is the boasting worth ? Now , if you can run as the antelope runs , and if you can turn like a hare , Come , race me , Jill , to the foot of the hill — and prove your boasting fair ! ” “ Race ? What is a race ? ” ( and a mocking face had Jill as she spake the word ) “ Unless for a prize the runner tries ? The truth indeed ye heard , For I can run as the antelope runs , and I can turn like a hare :— The first one down wins half a crown — and I will race you there ! ” “ Yea , if for the lesson that you will learn ( the lesson of humbled pride ) , The price you fix at two-and-six , it shall not be denied ; Come , take your stand at my right hand , for here is the mark we toe : Now , are you ready , and are you steady ? Gird up your petticoats ? Go ! ” And Jill she ran like a winging bolt , a bolt from the bow released , But Jack like a stream of the lightning gleam , with its pathway duly greased ; He ran down hill in front of Jill like a summer lightning flash — Till he suddenly tripped on a stone , or slipped , and fell to the earth with a crash . Then straight did rise on his wondering eyes the constellations fair , Arcturus and the Pleiades , the Greater and Lesser Bear , The swirling rain of a comet 's train he saw , as he swiftly fell — And Jill came tumbling after him with a loud , triumphant yell : “ You have won , you have won , the race is done ! And as for the wager laid — You have fallen down with a broken crown — the half-crown debt is paid ! ” They have taken Jack to the room at the back where the family medicines are , And he lies in bed with a broken head in a halo of vinegar ; While , in that Jill had laughed her fill as her brother fell to earth She had felt the sting of a walloping — she hath paid the price of her mirth ! Here is the tale — and now you have the whole of it ! Here is the story , well and wisely planned ; Beauty — Duty — these make up the soul of it — But , ah , my little readers , will you mark and understand ? Anthony C. Deane . THE LEGEND OF REALISM THIS is the sorrowful story , Told when the twilight fails , And the authors sit together Reading each other 's tales . “ Our fathers lived in the cloudland , They were Romanticists , They went down to the valley To play with the Scientists . “ Our fathers murmured of moonshine , Our fathers sang to the stars , Our fathers were playfully prolix , Our fathers knew nothing of ‘ pars . ’ “ Then came the terrible savants , Nothing of play they knew , Only — they caught our fathers , And set them to burrow too . “ Set them to work in the workshop , With crucible , test , and scales , Put them in mud-walled prisons , And — cut up their beautiful tales . “ Now we can read our fathers , Trenchant , and terse , and cold , Stooping to dig in dust-heaps , Sharing the common mold . “ Driving a quill quotidian , Mending a muddy plot , Sitting in mud-walled prisons , Steeping their souls in rot . “ Thus and so do our fathers , Thus and so must we do , For we are the slaves of science , And we are Realists too . ” This is the horrible story , Told as the twilight fails , And the authors sit together Reading each other 's tales . Hilda Johnson . AFTER STEPHEN PHILLIPS LITTLE JACK HORNER Little Jack Horner sat in an angle Meditating . Before we go farther , Please clearly understand this is blank verse . If it reads strangely , and the accent falls In unexpected places , do not dare To criticise . Remember once for all , That I and Milton judge questions like that — Vide my letters to the daily press . As for my critics — wholesale ignorance Were a term far too mild to paint their gross Unintellectuality . So much said , I start again . In a corner he sat , Remote from comrades . Resolutely his hand Clutched a delicious pie . Anon his thumb From the pasty depth produced a currant . ( Excuse another interruption , but Observe the beauty of that ultimate line ! With equal ease I might have written it “ Produced a currant from the pasty depth , ” But I — and Milton in his better moments — Prefer to be original . ) In his soul The obsession of his own superior virtue Grew and prevailed , till at the last he cried : “ I am a Paragon of Excellence ! ” Happy Jack Horner , thus fully convinced Of his remarkable superiority ! And happy readers , who peruse his tale Retold in such magnificent blank verse ! Anthony C. Deane . AFTER FIONA McLEOD , W. B. YEATS , AND OTHERS THE CULT OF THE CELTIC WHEN the eager squadrons of day are faint and disbanded , And under the wind-swept stars the reaper gleans The petulant passion flowers — although , to be candid , I have n't the faintest notion what that means — Surely the Snow-White Bird makes melody sweeter High in the air than skimming the clogging dust . ( Yes , there 's certainly something queer about this metre , But , as it 's Celtic , you and I must take it on trust . ) And oh , the smile of the Slave as he shakes his fetters ! And oh , the Purple Pig as it roams afar ! And oh , the — something or other in capital letters — As it yields to the magic spell of a wind-swept star ! And look at the tricksy Elves , how they leap and frolic , Ducking the Bad Banshee in the moonlit pool , Celtic , yet fully content to be “ symbolic , ” Never a thought in their heads about Home Rule ! But the wind-swept star — you notice it has to figure , Taking an average merely , in each alternate verse Of every Celtic poem — smiles with a palpable snigger , While the Yellow Wolf-Hound bays his blighting curse , And the voices of dead desires in sufferers waken , And the voice of the limitless lake is harsh and rough , And the voice of the reader , too , unless I 'm mistaken , Is heard to remark that he 's had about enough . But since the critics have stated with some decision That stanzas very like these are simply grand , Showing “ a sense of beauty and intimate vision , ” Proving a “ Celtic Renaissance ” close at hand ; Then , although I admit it 's a terrible tax on Powers like mine , yet I sincerely felt My task , as an unintelligent Saxon , Was , at all hazards , to try to copy the Celt ! Anthony C. Deane . AFTER VARIOUS WRITERS OF VERS DE SOCIETE BEHOLD THE DEEDS ! ( Chant Royal ) ( Being the Plaint of Adolphe Culpepper Ferguson , Salesman of Fancy Notions , held in durance of his Landlady for a failure to connect on Saturday night ) I I WOULD that all men my hard case might know ; How grievously I suffer for no sin : I , Adolphe Culpepper Ferguson , for lo ! I , of my landlady am locked in . For being short on this sad Saturday , Nor having shekels of silver wherewith to pay , She has turned and is departed with my key ; Wherefore , not even as other boarders free , I sing ( as prisoners to their dungeon stones When for ten days they expiate a spree ): Behold the deeds that are done of Mrs. Jones ! II One night and one day have I wept my woe ; Nor wot I when the morrow doth begin , If I shall have to write to Briggs &amp; Co ., To pray them to advance the requisite tin For ransom of their salesman , that he may Go forth as other boarders go alway — As those I hear now flocking from their tea , Led by the daughter of my landlady Pianoward . This day for all my moans , Dry bread and water have been served me . Behold the deeds that are done of Mrs. Jones ! III Miss Amabel Jones is musical , and so The heart of the young he-boarder doth win , Playing “ The Maiden 's Prayer , ” adagio — That fetcheth him , as fetcheth the banco skin The innocent rustic . For my part , I pray : That Badarjewska maid may wait for aye Ere sits she with a lover , as did we Once sit together , Amabel ! Can it be That all of that arduous wooing not atones For Saturday shortness of trade dollars three ? Behold the deeds that are done of Mrs. Jones ! IV Yea ! she forgets the arm was wont to go Around her waist . She wears a buckle whose pin Galleth the crook of the young man 's elbow ; I forget not , for I that youth have been . Smith was aforetime the Lothario gay . Yet once , I mind me , Smith was forced to stay Close in his room . Not calm , as I , was he ; But his noise brought no pleasaunce , verily . Small ease he gat of playing on the bones , Or hammering on his stove-pipe , that I see . Behold the deeds that are done of Mrs. Jones ! V Thou , for whose fear the figurative crow I eat , accursed be thou and all thy kin ! Thee will I show up — yea , up will I show Thy too thick buckwheats , and thy tea too thin Ay ! here I dare thee , ready for the fray ! Thou dost not keep a first-class house , I say ! It does not with the advertisements agree . Thou lodgest a Briton with a pugaree , And thou hast harbored Jacobses and Cohns , Also a Mulligan . Thus denounce I thee ! Behold the deeds that are done of Mrs. Jones ! ENVOY Boarders ! the worst I have not told to ye : She hath stole my trousers , that I may not flee Privily by the window . Hence these groans , There is no fleeing in a robe de nuit . Behold the deeds that are done of Mrs. Jones ! H. C. Bunner . CULTURE IN THE SLUMS</note>

A BALLADE OF BALLADE-MONGERS ( After the manner of Master Francois Villon of Paris ) IN Ballades things always contrive to get lost , And Echo is constantly asking where Are last year 's roses and last year 's frost ? And where are the fashions we used to wear ? And what is a “ gentleman , ” and what is a “ player ” ? Irrelevant questions I like to ask : Can you reap the tret as well as the tare ? And who was the Man in the Iron Mask ? What has become of the ring I tossed In the lap of my mistress false and fair ? Her grave is green and her tombstone mossed ; But who is to be the next Lord Mayor ? And where is King William , of Leicester Square ? And who has emptied my hunting flask ? And who is possessed of Stella 's hair ? And who was the Man in the Iron Mask ? And what became of the knee I crossed , And the rod and the child they would not spare ? And what will a dozen herring cost When herring are sold at three halfpence a pair ? And what in the world is the Golden Stair ? Did Diogenes die in a tub or cask , Like Clarence , for love of liquor there ? And who was the Man in the Iron Mask ? ENVOY Poets , your readers have much to bear , For Ballade-making is no great task , If you do not remember , I do n't much care Who was the man in the Iron Mask . Augustus M. Moore AFTER VARIOUS POPULAR SONGS BEAUTIFUL SNOW ( With a drift ) OH ! the snow , the beautiful snow ( This is a parody , please , you know ; Over and over again you may meet Parodies writ on this poem so sweet ; Rhyming , chiming , skipping along , Comical bards think they do nothing wrong ; Striving to follow what others have done , One to the number may keep up the fun ) . Beautiful snow , so gently you scud , Pure for a minute , then dirty as mud ! Oh ! the snow , the beautiful snow ! Here 's a fine mess you have left us below ; Chilling our feet to the tips of our toes ; Cheekily landing full pert on our nose ; Jinking , slinking , ever you try ‘ Neath our umbrella to flop in our eye ; Gamins await us at every new street , Watching us carefully , guiding our feet , Joking , mocking , ready to throw A hard-compressed ball of this beautiful snow .

May nothing you dismay ; Not even the dyspeptic plats Through which you 'll eat your way ; Nor yet the heavy Christmas bills The season bids you pay ; No , nor the ever tiresome need Of being to order gay ; Nor yet the shocking cold you 'll catch If fog and slush hold sway ; Nor yet the tumbles you must bear If frost should win the day ; Nor sleepless nights — they 're sure to come — When “ waits ” attune their lay ; Nor pantomimes , whose dreariness Might turn macassar gray ; Nor boisterous children , home in heaps , And ravenous of play ; Nor yet — in fact , the host of ills Which Christmases array . God rest you , merry gentlemen , May none of these dismay ! Anonymous . THE TALE OF LORD LOVELL LORD LOVELL he stood at his own front door , Seeking the hole for the key ; His hat was wrecked , and his trousers bore A rent across either knee , When down came the beauteous Lady Jane In fair white draperie . “ Oh , where have you been , Lord Lovell ? ” she said , “ Oh , where have you been ? ” said she ; “ I have not closed an eye in bed , And the clock has just struck three . Who has been standing you on your head In the ash-barrel , pardie ? ” “ I am not drunk , Lad ’ Shane , ” he said : “ And so late it cannot be ; The clock struck one as I entered — I heard it two times or three ; It must be the salmon on which I fed Has been too many for me . ” “ Go tell your tale , Lord Lovell , ” she said , “ To the maritime cavalree , To your grandmother of the hoary head — To any one but me : The door is not used to be opened With a cigarette for a key . ” Anonymous . “ SONGS WITHOUT WORDS ” I CANNOT sing the old songs , Though well I know the tune , Familiar as a cradle-song With sleep-compelling croon ; Yet though I 'm filled with music As choirs of summer birds , “ I cannot sing the old songs ” — I do not know the words . I start on “ Hail Columbia , ” And get to “ heav'nhYpppHeNborn band , ” And there I strike an up-grade With neither steam nor sand ; “ Star-Spangled Banner ” downs me Right in my wildest screaming , I start all right , but dumbly come To voiceless wreck at “ streaming . ” So when I sing the old songs , Do n't murmur or complain If “ Ti , diddy ah da , tum dum ” Should fill the sweetest strain .

THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN BY the side of a murmuring stream , an elderly gentleman sat , On the top of his head was his wig , and a-top of his wig was his hat . The wind it blew high and blew strong , as the elderly gentleman sat ; And bore from his head in a trice , and plunged in the river his hat . The gentleman then took his cane , which lay by his side as he sat ; And he dropped in the river his wig , in attempting to get out his hat . His breast it grew cold with despair , and full in his eye madness sat ; So he flung in the river his cane to swim with his wig and his hat . Cool reflection at last came across , while this elderly gentleman sat ; So he thought he would follow the stream , and look for his cane , wig , and hat . His head , being thicker than common , o'erbalanced the rest of his fat , And in plumpt this son of a woman , to follow his wig , cane , and hat . George Canning .

It may not be till years are passed , Till chubby children 's locks are gray ; The tailor trusts us , but at last His reckoning we must meet some day . Some day — some day — some day I must meet it , Snip , I know not when or how , Snip , I know not when or how ; Only this — only this — this that once you did me — Only this — I 'll do you now — I 'll do you now now — I 'll do you now ! I know not are you far or near — Are you at rest , or cutting still ? I know not who is held so dear ! Or who 's to pay your “ little bill ” ! But when it comes ,— some day — some day — These eyes an awful tote may see ; And do n't you wish , my tailor gay , That you may get your L. s. d .? Some day — some day — some day I must meet it , Snip , I know not when or how , Snip , I know not when or how ; Only this — only this — this that once you did me — Only this — I 'll do you now — I 'll do you now now — I 'll do you now !

IF I SHOULD DIE TO-NIGHT IF I should die to-night And you should come to my cold corpse and say , Weeping and heartsick o'er my lifeless clay — If I should die to-night , And you should come in deepest grief and woe — And say : “ Here 's that ten dollars that I owe , ” I might arise in my large white cravat And say , “ What 's that ? ” If I should die to-night And you should come to my cold corpse and kneel , Clasping my bier to show the grief you feel , I say , if I should die to-night And you should come to me , and there and then Just even hint ‘ bout paying me that ten , I might arise the while , But I 'd drop dead again . Ben King . A LOVE SONG ( In the modern taste , 1733 ) FLUTTERING spread thy purple pinions , Gentle Cupid , o'er my heart ; I , a slave in thy dominions ; Nature must give way to art . Mild Arcadians , ever blooming , Nightly nodding o'er your flocks , See my weary days consuming All beneath yon flowery rocks . Thus the Cyprian goddess weeping Mourn 'd Adonis , darling youth ; Him the boar , in silence creeping , Gored with unrelenting tooth . Cynthia , tune harmonious numbers , Fair Discretion , string the lyre ; Soothe my ever-waking slumbers ; Bright Apollo , lend thy choir . Gloomy Pluto , king of terrors , Arm 'd in adamantine chains , Lead me to the crystal mirrors Watering soft Elysian plains . Mourning cypress , verdant willow , Gilding my Aurelia 's brows , Morpheus hovering o'er my pillow , Hear me pay my dying vows . Melancholy smooth Meander , Swiftly purling in a round , On thy margin lovers wander , With thy flowery chaplets crowned . Thus when Philomela drooping Softly seeks her silent mate , See the bird of Juno stooping ; Melody resigns to fate . Dean Swift . OLD FASHIONED FUN WHEN that old joke was new , It was not hard to joke , And puns we now pooh-pooh , Great laughter would provoke . True wit was seldom heard , And humor shown by few , When reign 'd King George the Third , And that old joke was new . It passed indeed for wit , Did this achievement rare , When down your friend would sit , To steal away his chair . You brought him to the floor , You bruised him black and blue , And this would cause a roar , When your old joke was new . W. M. Thackeray . THEMES WITH VARIATIONS HOME SWEET HOME WITH VARIATIONS ( Being suggestions of the various styles in which an old theme might have been treated by certain metrical composers ) FANTASIA I The original theme as John Howard Payne wrote it : MID pleasures and palaces though we may roam , Be it ever so humble , there 's no place like home ! A charm from the skies seems to hallow it there , Which , seek through the world , is not met with elsewhere . Home , home ! Sweet , Sweet Home ! There 's no place like Home ! An exile from home , splendor dazzles in vain ! Oh , give me my lowly thatched cottage again ! The birds singing gaily that came at my call ! Give me them ! and the peace of mind , dearer than all . Home , home ! Sweet , Sweet Home ! There 's no place like Home ! II ( As Algernon Charles Swinburne might have wrapped it up in variations ) ( ‘ Mid pleasures and palaces —) As sea-foam blown of the winds , as blossom of brine that is drifted Hither and yon on the barren breast of the breeze , Though we wander on gusts of a god 's breath , shaken and shifted , The salt of us stings and is sore for the sobbing seas . For home 's sake hungry at heart , we sicken in pillared porches Of bliss made sick for a life that is barren of bliss , For the place whereon is a light out of heaven that sears not nor scorches , Nor elsewhere than this . ( An exile from home , splendor dazzles in vain —) For here we know shall no gold thing glisten , No bright thing burn , and no sweet thing shine ; Nor love lower never an ear to listen To words that work in the heart like wine . What time we are set from our land apart , For pain of passion and hunger of heart , Though we walk with exiles fame faints to christen , Or sing at the Cytherean 's shrine . ( Variation : An exile from home —) Whether with him whose head Of gods is honored , With song made splendent in the sight of men — Whose heart most sweetly stout , From ravishing France cast out , Being firstly hers , was hers most wholly then — Or where on shining seas like wine The dove 's wings draw the drooping Erycine . ( Give me my lowly thatched cottage —) For Joy finds Love grow bitter , And spreads his wings to quit her , At thought of birds that twitter Beneath the roof-tree 's straw — Of birds that come for calling , No fear or fright appalling , When dews of dusk are falling , Or daylight 's draperies draw . ( Give me them , and the peace of mind —) Give me these things then back , though the giving Be at cost of earth 's garner of gold ; There is no life without these worth living , No treasure where these are not told . For the heart give the hope that it knows not , Give the balm for the burn of the breast — For the soul and the mind that repose not , Oh , give us a rest !

Right thar lies my home — Right thar in the red — I could slop over , stranger , in po'try — Would spread out old Shakspoke cold dead . Stranger , you freeze to this : there ai n't no kinder gin-palace , Nor no variety-show lays over a man 's own rancho . Maybe it hai n't no style , but the Queen in the Tower o ’ London , Ai n't got naathin ’ I 'd swop for that house over thar on the hill-side . Thar is my ole gal , ‘ n ’ the kids , ‘ n ’ the rest o ’ my live-stock ; Thar my Remington hangs , and thar there 's a griddle-cake br'ilin ’ — For the two of us , pard — and thar , I allow , the heavens Smile more friendly-like than on any other locality . Stranger , nowhere else I do n't take no satisfaction . Gimme my ranch , ‘ n ’ them friendly old Shanghai chickens — I brung the original pair f 'm the States in eighteen - ‘ n ’ - fifty — Gimme me them and the feelin ’ of solid domestic comfort . Yer parding , young man — But this landscape a kind Er flickers — I ‘ low ‘ twuz the po'try — I thought that my eyes hed gone blind . Take that pop from my belt ! Hi , thar !— gimme yer han ’ — Or I 'll kill myself — Lizzie — she 's left me — Gone off with a purtier man ! Thar , I 'll quit — the ole gal An ’ the kids — run away ! I be derned ! Howsomever , come in , pard — The griddle-cake 's thar , anyway . IV ( As Austin Dobson might have translated it from Horace , if it had ever occurred to Horace to write it ) RONDEAU At home alone , O Nomades , Although Maecenas ’ marble frieze Stand not between you and the sky , Nor Persian luxury supply Its rosy surfeit , find ye ease . Tempt not the far AEgean breeze ; With home-made wine and books that please , To duns and bores the door deny , At home , alone . Strange joys may lure . Your deities Smile here alone . Oh , give me these : Low eaves , where birds familiar fly , And peace of mind , and , fluttering by , My Lydia 's graceful draperies , At home , alone . V ( As it might have been constructed in 1744 , Oliver Goldsmith , at 19 , writing the first stanza , and Alexander Pope , at 52 , the second ) Home ! at the word , what blissful visions rise , Lift us from earth , and draw toward the skies ; ‘ Mid mirag 'd towers , or meretricious joys , Although we roam , one thought the mind employs : Or lowly hut , good friend , or loftiest dome , Earth knows no spot so holy as our Home . There , where affection warms the father 's breast , There is the spot of heav'n most surely blest . Howe'er we search , though wandering with the wind Through frigid Zembla , or the heats of Ind , Not elsewhere may we seek , nor elsewhere know , The light of heaven upon our dark below . When from our dearest hope and haven reft , Delight nor dazzles , nor is luxury left , We long , obedient to our nature 's law , To see again our hovel thatched with straw : See birds that know our avenaceous store Stoop to our hand , and thence repleted soar : But , of all hopes the wanderer 's soul that share , His pristine peace of mind 's his final prayer . VI ( As Walt Whitman might have written all around it ) I You over there , young man with the guide-book , red-bound , covered flexibly with red linen , Come here , I want to talk with you ; I , Walt , the Manhattanese , citizen of these States , call you . Yes , and the courier , too , smirking , smug-mouthed , with oil 'd hair ; a garlicky look about him generally ; him , too , I take in , just as I would a coyote or a king , or a toad-stool , or a ham-sandwich , or anything , or anybody else in the world . Where are you going ? You want to see Paris , to eat truffles , to have a good time ; in Vienna , London , Florence , Monaco , to have a good time ; you want to see Venice . Come with me . I will give you a good time ; I will give you all the Venice you want , and most of the Paris . I , Walt , I call to you . I am all on deck ! Come and loafe with me ! Let me tote you around by your elbow and show you things . You listen to my ophicleide ! Home ! Home , I celebrate . I elevate my fog-whistle , inspir 'd by the thought of home . Come in !— take a front seat ; the jostle of the crowd not minding ; there is room enough for all of you . This is my exhibition — it is the greatest show on earth — there is no charge for admission . All you have to pay me is to take in my romanza . II 1 . The brown-stone house ; the father coming home worried from a bad day 's business ; the wife meets him in the marble pav 'd vestibule ; she throws her arms about him ; she presses him close to her ; she looks him full in the face with affectionate eyes ; the frown from his brow disappearing . Darling , she says , Johnny has fallen down and cut his head ; the cook is going away , and the boiler leaks . 2 . The mechanic 's dark little third-story room , seen in a flash from the Elevated Railway train ; the sewing-machine in a corner ; the small cook-stove ; the whole family eating cabbage around a kerosene lamp ; of the clatter and roar and groaning wail of the Elevated train unconscious ; of the smell of the cabbage unconscious . Me , passant , in the train , of the cabbage not quite so unconscious . 3 . The French Flat ; the small rooms , all right-angles , unindividual ; the narrow halls ; the gaudy , cheap decorations everywhere . The janitor and the cook exchanging compliments up and down the elevator-shaft ; the refusal to send up more coal , the solid splash of the water upon his head , the language he sends up the shaft , the triumphant laughter of the cook , to her kitchen retiring . 4 . The widow 's small house in the suburbs of the city ; the widow 's boy coming home from his first day down town ; he is flushed with happiness and pride ; he is no longer a school-boy , he is earning money ; he takes on the airs of a man and talks learnedly of business . 5 . The room in the third-class boarding-house ; the mean little hard-coal fire , the slovenly Irish servant-girl making it , the ashes on the hearth , the faded furniture , the private provender hid away in the closet , the dreary backyard out the window ; the young girl at the glass , with her mouth full of hairpins , doing up her hair to go downstairs and flirt with the young fellows in the parlor . 6 . The kitchen of the old farm-house ; the young convict just returned from prison — it was his first offense , and the judges were lenient on him . He is taking his first meal out of prison ; he has been received back , kiss 'd , encourag 'd to start again ; his lungs , his nostrils expand with the big breaths of free air ; with shame , with wonderment , with a trembling joy , his heart too , expanding . The old mother busies herself about the table ; she has ready for him the dishes he us 'd to like ; the father sits with his back to them , reading the newspaper , the newspaper shaking and rustling much ; the children hang wondering around the prodigal — they have been caution 'd : Do not ask where our Jim has been ; only say you are glad to see him . The elder daughter is there , palefac 'd , quiet ; her young man went back on her four years ago ; his folks would not let him marry a convict 's sister . She sits by the window , sewing on the children 's clothes , the clothes not only patching up ; her hunger for children of her own invisibly patching up . The brother looks up ; he catches her eye , he fearful , apologetic ; she smiles back at him , not reproachfully smiling , with loving pretence of hope smiling — it is too much for him ; he buries his face in the folds of the mother 's black gown . 7 . The best room of the house , on the Sabbath only open 'd ; the smell of horse-hair furniture and mahogany varnish ; the ornaments on the what-not in the corner ; the wax fruit , dusty , sunken , sagged in , consumptive-looking , under a glass globe , the sealing-wax imitation of coral ; the cigar boxes with shells plastered over , the perforated card-board motto . The kitchen ; the housewife sprinkling the clothes for the fine ironing to-morrow — it is the Third-day night , and the plain things are ready iron 'd , now in cupboards , in drawers stowed away . The wife waiting for the husband — he is at the tavern , jovial , carousing ; she , alone in the kitchen sprinkling clothes — the little red wood clock with peaked top , with pendulum wagging behind a pane of gayly painted glass , strikes twelve . The sound of the husband 's voice on the still night air — he is singing : “ We wo n't go home until morning ! ” — the wife arising , toward the wood-shed hastily going , stealthily entering , the voice all the time coming nearer , inebriate , chantant . The husband passing the door of the wood-shed ; the club over his head , now with his head in contact ; the sudden cessation of the song ; the benediction of peace over the domestic foyer temporarily resting . I sing the soothing influences of home . You , young man , thoughtlessly wandering , with courier , with guide-book wandering , You hearken to the melody of my steam-calliope Yawp ! Henry Cuyler Bunner . MODERN VERSIFICATION ON ANCIENT THEMES GOOSE A LA MODE — Mary , Mary , quite contrary , How does your garden grow ? WITHIN the garden 's deepness filled of light Stood Mary , and upon her fair green gown Fell glory of gold hair , a stern sweet frown Was on her forehead , slim cold hands and white Made ending of her long pale arms ’ delight . And questioning , I — “ How does your garden grow ? ” Then she — “ With bells that ring , and shells that sing Of strange gray seas , with fair , strong hands that cling Together , stand tall damozels a-row . ” Elizabeth Cavazza . THREE CHILDREN SLIDING — Three children sliding on the ice All on a summer 's day . FOUR are the names of the seasons — spring , summer , autumn , and winter . Summer is hot and winter is cold , while the others partake in Greater or less degree of cold and caloric commingled . Surely , I think , it is well to be good , and my mind is astonished At the exceeding sin of sinfulness , whereof the perils Shown in my verse are apparent . Three rosy children were sliding Over the ice in summer and — fate so decreeing , it happened — Fell through the ice and were drowned . Had these children in winter been sliding On the bare earth , or had they , by the peaceful fireside sitting , Studied their catechism , it were strange — so the novel thought strikes me — Even in summer 's heat had the ice broken suddenly under Avoirdupois of these babes , and diluted the well-springs of pleasure . JACK AND JILL — Jack and Jill went up a hill To draw a pail of water . WHAT moan is made of the mountain , what sob of the hillside , Why a lament of the south wind , and rainfall as tears ? Brother and sister , once bodies and spirits together , Fell as fair ghosts down the sad swift slope of the years . Where is the fount on the mount where the thrill of water Sang as a siren its song to the steep beneath ? Where are the feet of the son and the fair-eyed daughter , Feet drawn aside of Fate , and set in the pathway of Death ! Ah cruel earth and hard , ah , pitiless laughter Made of the waters , when , shattered his golden crown , Fell the fair boy as a star , and his sister after , To the field of the dead , to its cold and the darkness unknown ! Elizabeth Cavazza . JACK AND JILL ( As Austin Dobson might have written it ) THEIR pail they must fill In a crystalline springlet , Brave Jack and fair Jill . Their pail they must fill At the top of the hill , Then she gives him a ringlet . Their pail they must fill In a crystalline springlet . They stumbled and fell , And poor Jack broke his forehead , Oh , how he did yell ! They stumbled and fell , And went down pell-mell — By Jove ! it was horrid . They stumbled and fell , And poor Jack broke his forehead . ( As Swinburne might have written it ) The shudd'ring sheet of rain athwart the trees ! The crashing kiss of lightning on the seas ! The moaning of the night wind on the wold , That erstwhile was a gentle , murm'ring breeze ! On such a night as this went Jill and Jack With strong and sturdy strides through dampness black To find the hill 's high top and water cold , Then toiling through the town to bear it back . The water drawn , they rest awhile . Sweet sips Of nectar then for Jack from Jill 's red lips , And then with arms entwined they homeward go ; Till mid the mad mud 's moistened mush Jack slips . Sweet Heaven , draw a veil on this sad plight , His crazed cries and cranium cracked ; the fright Of gentle Jill , her wretchedness and wo ! Kind Phoebus , drive thy steeds and end this night ! ( As Walt Whitman might have written it ) I celebrate the personality of Jack ! I love his dirty hands , his tangled hair , his locomotion blundering . Each wart upon his hands I sing , Paeans I chant to his hulking shoulder blades . Also Jill ! Her I celebrate . I , Walt , of unbridled thought and tongue , Whoop her up ! What 's the matter with Jill ? Oh , she 's all right ! Who 's all right ? Jill . Her golden hair , her sun-struck face , her hard and reddened hands ; So , too , her feet , hefty , shambling . I see them in the evening , when the sun empurples the horizon , and through the darkening forest aisles are heard the sounds of myriad creatures of the night . I see them climb the steep ascent in quest of water for their mother . Oh , speaking of her , I could celebrate the old lady if I had time . She is simply immense ! But Jack and Jill are walking up the hill . ( I did n't mean that rhyme . ) I must watch them . I love to watch their walk , And wonder as I watch ; He , stoop-shouldered , clumsy , hide-bound , Yet lusty , Bearing his share of the 1-lb bucket as though it were a paperweight . She , erect , standing , her head uplifting , Holding , but bearing not the bucket . They have reached the spring . They have filled the bucket . Have you heard the “ Old Oaken Bucket ” ? I will sing it :— Of what countless patches is the bed-quilt of life composed ! Here is a piece of lace . A babe is born . The father is happy , the mother is happy . Next black crepe . A beldame “ shuffles off this mortal coil . ” Now brocaded satin with orange blossoms , Mendelssohn 's “ Wedding March , ” an old shoe missile , A broken carriage window , the bride in the Bellevue sleeping . Here 's a large piece of black cloth ! “ Have you any last words to say ? ” “ No . ” “ Sheriff , do your work ! ” Thus it is : from “ grave to gay , from lively to severe . ” I mourn the downfall of my Jack and Jill . I see them descending , obstacles not heeding . I see them pitching headlong , the water from the pail outpouring , a noise from leathern lungs out-belching . The shadows of the night descend on Jack , recumbent , bellowing , his pate with gore besmeared . I love his cowardice , because it is an attribute , just like Job 's patience or Solomon 's wisdom , and I love attributes . Whoop !!! Charles Battell Loomis . THE REJECTED “ NATIONAL HYMNS ” I BY H — Y W.

Kerr . ” ) A THEME WITH VARIATIONS THEME RIDE a cock-horse to Banbury Cross , To see a fine lady ride on a white horse ; With rings on her fingers , and bells on her toes , She shall have music wherever she goes . ( Variation I .— Edmund Spenser ) So on he pricked , and loe , he gan espy , A market and a crosse of glist'ning stone , And eke a merrie rablement thereby , That with the musik of the strong trombone , And shaumes , and trompets made most dyvillish mone . And in their midst he saw a lady sweet , That rode upon a milk white steed alone , In scarlet robe ycladd and wimple meet , Bedight with rings of gold , and bells about her feet . Whereat the knight empassioned was so deepe , His heart was perst with very agony . Certes ( said he ) I will not eat , ne sleepe , Till I have seen the royall maid more ny ; Then will I holde her in fast fealtie , Whom then a carle advised , louting low , That little neede there was for him to die , Sithens in yon pavilion was the show , Where she did ride , and he for two-and-six mote go . ( Variation II .— Dr . Jonathan Swift ) Our Chloe , fresh from London town , To country B —— y comes down . Furnished with half-a-thousand graces Of silks , brocades , and hoops , and laces ; And tired of winning coxcombs ’ hearts , On simple bumpkins tries her arts . Behold her ambling down the street On her white palfrey , sleek and neat . ( Though rumor talks of gaming-tables , And says ‘ twas won from C —— ‘ s stables . And that , when duns demand their bill , She satisfies them at quadrille . ) Her fingers are encased with rings , Although she vows she hates the things . ( “ Oh , la ! Why ever did you buy it ? Well — it 's a pretty gem — I 'll try it . ” ) The fine French fashions all combine To make folk stare , and Chloe shine , From ribbon 'd hat with monstrous feather , To bells upon her under-leather . Now Chloe , why , do you suppose , You wear those bells about your toes ? Is it , your feet with bells you deck For want of bows about your neck ? ( Variation III — Sir Walter Scott From “ The Lady of the Cake ” ) “ Who is this maid in wild array , And riding in that curious way ? What mean the bells that jingle free About her as in revelry ? ” “ ‘ Tis Madge of Banbury , ” Roderick said . “ And she 's a trifle off her head , ‘ Twas on her bridal morn , I ween , When she to Graeme had wedded been , The man who undertook to bake Never sent home the wedding cake ! Since then she wears those bells and rings , Since then she rides — but , hush , she sings . ” She sung ! The voice in other days It had been difficult to praise , And now it every sweetness lacked , And voice and singer both were cracked . SONG They bid me ride the other way , They say my brain is warp 'd and wrung , But , oh ! the bridal bells are gay That I about my feet have strung ! And when I face the horse 's tail I see once more in Banbury 's vale My Graeme 's white plume before me wave , So thus I 'll ride until the grave . They say that this is not my home , ‘ Mid Scotland 's moors and Scotland 's brakes . But , oh ! ‘ tis love that makes me roam Forever in the land of cakes ! And woe betide the baker 's guile , Whose blight destroyed the maiden 's smile ! O woe the day , and woe the deed , And woa — gee woa — my bonnie steed ! Barry Pain . THE POETS AT TEA 1 .— ( Macaulay , who made it ) POUR , varlet , pour the water , The water steaming hot ! A spoonful for each man of us , Another for the pot ! We shall not drink from amber , Nor Capuan slave shall mix For us the snows of Athos With port at thirty-six ; Whiter than snow the crystals , Grown sweet ‘ neath tropic fires , More rich the herbs of China 's field , The pasture-lands more fragrance yield ; For ever let Britannia wield The tea-pot of her sires ! 2 .— ( Tennyson , who took it hot ) I think that I am drawing to an end : For on a sudden came a gasp for breath , And stretching of the hands , and blinded eyes , And a great darkness falling on my soul . O Hallelujah !... Kindly pass the milk . 3 .— ( Swinburne , who let it get cold ) As the sin that was sweet in the sinning Is foul in the ending thereof , As the heat of the summer 's beginning Is past in the winter of love : O purity , painful and pleading ! O coldness , ineffably gray ! Oh , hear us , our handmaid unheeding , And take it away ! 4 .— ( Cowper , who thoroughly enjoyed it ) The cosy fire is bright and gay , The merry kettle boils away And hums a cheerful song . I sing the saucer and the cup ; Pray , Mary , fill the tea-pot up , And do not make it strong . 5 .— ( Browning , who treated it allegorically ) Tut ! Bah ! We take as another case — Pass the bills on the pills on the window-sill ; notice the capsule ( A sick man 's fancy , no doubt , but I place Reliance on trade-marks , Sir ) — so perhaps you 'll Excuse the digression — this cup which I hold Light-poised — Bah , it 's spilt in the bed !— well , let 's on go — Hold Bohea and sugar , Sir ; if you were told The sugar was salt , would the Bohea be Congo ? 6 .— ( Wordsworth , who gave it away ) “ Come , little cottage girl , you seem To want my cup of tea ; And will you take a little cream ? Now tell the truth to me . ” She had a rustic , woodland grin , Her cheek was soft as silk , And she replied , “ Sir , please put in A little drop of milk . ” “ Why , what put milk into your head ? ‘ Tis cream my cows supply ; ” And five times to the child I said , “ Why , pig-head , tell me , why ? ” “ You call me pig-head , ” she replied ; “ My proper name is Ruth . I called that milk ” — she blushed with pride — “ You bade me speak the truth . ” 7 .— ( Poe , who got excited over it ) Here 's a mellow cup of tea , golden tea ! What a world of rapturous thought its fragrance brings to me ! Oh , from out the silver cells How it wells ! How it smells ! Keeping tune , tune , tune To the tintinnabulation of the spoon . And the kettle on the fire Boils its spout off with desire , With a desperate desire And a crystalline endeavour Now , now to sit , or never , On the top of the pale-faced moon , But he always came home to tea , tea , tea , tea , tea , Tea to the n — th . 8 .— ( Rossetti , who took six cups of it ) The lilies lie in my lady 's bower ( O weary mother , drive the cows to roost ) , They faintly droop for a little hour ; My lady 's head droops like a flower . She took the porcelain in her hand ( O weary mother , drive the cows to roost ) ; She poured ; I drank at her command ; Drank deep , and now — you understand ! ( O weary mother , drive the cows to roost . ) 9 .— ( Burns , who liked it adulterated ) Weel , gin ye speir , I 'm no inclined , Whusky or tay — to state my mind , Fore ane or ither ; For , gin I tak the first , I 'm fou , And gin the next , I 'm dull as you , Mix a ’ thegither . 10 .— ( Walt Whitman , who did n't stay more than a minute ) One cup for my self-hood , Many for you . Allons , camerados , we will drink together , O hand-in-hand ! That tea-spoon , please , when you 've done with it . What butter-colour 'd hair you 've got . I do n't want to be personal . All right , then , you need n't . You 're a stale-cadaver . Eighteen-pence if the bottles are returned . Allons , from all bat-eyed formula . Barry Pain . THE POETS AT A HOUSE-PARTY ( A modern mortal having inadvertently stumbled in upon a house-party of poets given on Mount Olympus , being called upon to justify his presence there by writing a poem , offered a Limerick . Whereupon each poet scoffed , and the mortal , offended , challenged them to do better with the same theme ) The Limerick A SCHOLARLY person named Finck Went mad in the effort to think Which were graver misplaced , To dip pen in his paste , Or dip his paste-brush in the ink . ( Omar Khayyam 's version ) Stay , fellow-traveler , let us stop and think , Pause and reflect on the abysmal brink ; Say , would you rather thrust your pen in paste , Or dip your paste-brush carelessly in ink ? ( Rudyard Kipling 's version ) Here is a theme that is worthy of our cognizance , A theme of great importance and a question for your ken ; Would you rather — stop and think well — Dip your paste-brush in your ink-well , Or in your pesky pasting-pot immerse your ink pen ? ( Walt Whitman 's version ) Hail , Camerados ! I salute you , Also I salute the sewing-machine , and the flour-barrel , and the feather-duster . What is an aborigine , anyhow ? I see a paste-pot . Ay , and a well of ink . Well , well ! Which shall I do ? Ah , the immortal fog . What am I myself But a meteor In the fog ? ( Chaucer 's version ) A mayde ther ben , a wordy one and wyse , Who wore a paire of gogles on her eyes . O'er theemes of depest thogt her braine she werked , Nor ever any knoty problemme sherked . Yette when they askt her if she 'd rather sinke Her penne in payste , or eke her brushe in inke , “ Ah , ” quo ’ the canny mayde , “ now wit ye wel , I 'm wyse enow to know — too wyse to tel . ” ( Henry James ’ version ) She luminously wavered , and I tentatively inferred that she would soon perfectly reconsider her not altogether unobvious course . Furiously , though with a tender , ebbing similitude , across her mental consciousness stole a re-culmination of all the truths she had ever known concerning , or even remotely relating to , the not-easily fathomed qualities of paste and ink . So she stood , focused in an intensity of soul-quivers , and I , all unrelenting , waited , though of a dim uncertainty whether , after all , it might not be only a dubitant problem . ( Swinburne 's version ) Shall I dip , shall I dip it , Dolores , This luminous paste-brush of thine ? Shall I sully its white-breasted glories , Its fair , foam-flecked figure divine ? Or shall I — abstracted , unheeding — Swish swirling this pen in my haste , And , deaf to thy pitiful pleading , Just jab it in paste ? ( Eugene Field 's version ) See the Ink Bottle on the Desk ! It is full of Nice Black Ink . Why , the Paste-Pot is there , Too ! Let us watch Papa as he sits down to write . Oh , he is going to paste a Second-hand Stamp on a Letter . See , he has dipped his Brush in the Ink by Mistake . Oh , what a Funny Mistake ! Now , although it is Winter , we may have to Endure the Heated Term . ( Stephen Crane 's version ) I stood upon a church spire , A slender , pointed spire , And I saw Ranged in solemn row before me , A paste-pot and an ink-pot . I held in my either hand A pen and a brush . Ay , a pen and a brush . Now this is the strange part ; I stood upon a church spire , A slender , pointed spire , Glad , exultant , Because The choice was mine ! Ay , mine ! As I stood upon a church spire , A slender , pointed spire . ( Mr. Dooley 's version ) “ I see by th ’ pa-apers , Hennessy , ” said Mr. Dooley , “ that they'se a question up for dee-bate . ” “ What 's a dee-bate ? ” asked Mr. Hennessy . “ Well , it 's different from a fish-bait , ” returned Mr. Dooley , “ an ’ it 's like this , if I can bate it into the thick head of ye . A lot of people argyfies an ’ argyfies to decide , as in the prisint instance , whether a man 'd rayther shtick his pastin ’ - brush in his ink-shtand , or if he 'd like it betther to be afther dippin ’ his pen in his pashte-pot . ” “ Thot , ” said Mr. Hennessy , “ is a foolish question , an ’ only fools wud argyfy about such a thing as thot . ” “ That 's what makes it a dee-bate , ” said Mr. Dooley . Carolyn Wells . AN OLD SONG BY NEW SINGERS ( In the original ) MARY had a little lamb , Its fleece was white as snow ,— And everywhere that Mary went The lamb was sure to go . ( As Austin Dobson writes it ) TRIOLET A little lamb had Mary , sweet , With a fleece that shamed the driven snow . Not alone Mary went when she moved her feet ( For a little lamb had Mary , sweet ) , And it tagged her ‘ round with a pensive bleat , And wherever she went it wanted to go ; A little lamb had Mary , sweet , With a fleece that shamed the driven snow . ( As Mr. Browning has it ) You knew her ?— Mary the small , How of a summer ,— or , no , was it fall ? You 'd never have thought it , never believed , But the girl owned a lamb last fall . Its wool was subtly , silky white , Color of lucent obliteration of night , Like the shimmering snow or — our Clothild 's arm ! You 've seen her arm — her right , I mean — The other she scalded a-washing , I ween — How white it is and soft and warm ? Ah , there was soul 's heart-love , deep , true , and tender , Wherever went Mary , the maiden so slender , There followed , his all-absorbed passion , inciting , That passionate lambkin — her soul 's heart delighting — Ay , every place that Mary sought in , That lamb was sure to soon be caught in . ( As Longfellow might have done it ) Fair the daughter known as Mary , Fair and full of fun and laughter , Owned a lamb , a little he-goat , Owned him all herself and solely . White the lamb 's wool as the Gotchi — The great Gotchi , driving snowstorm . Hither Mary went and thither , But went with her to all places , Sure as brook to run to river , Her pet lambkin following with her . ( How Andrew Lang sings it ) RONDEAU A wonderful lass was Marie , petite , And she looked full fair and passing sweet — And , oh ! she owned — but cannot you guess What pet can a maiden so love and caress As a tiny lamb with a plaintive bleat , And mud upon his dainty feet , And a gentle veally odour of meat , And a fleece to finger and kiss and press — White as snow ? Wherever she wandered , in lane or street , As she sauntered on , there at her feet She would find that lambkin — bless The dear !— treading on her dainty dress , Her dainty dress , fresh and neat — White as snow ! ( Mr. Algernon C. Swinburne 's idea ) VILLANELLE Dewy-eyed with shimmering hair , Maiden and lamb were a sight to see , For her pet was white as she was fair . And its lovely fleece was beyond compare , And dearly it loved its Mistress Marie , Dewy-eyed , with shimmering hair . Its warped wool was an inwove snare , To tangle her fingers in , where they could be ( For her pet was white as she was fair ) . Lost from sight , both so snow-white were , And the lambkin adored the maiden wee , Dewy-eyed with shimmering hair . Th ’ impassioned incarnation of rare , Of limpid-eyed , luscious-lipped , loved beauty , And her pet was white as she was fair . Wherever she wandered , hither and there , Wildly that lambkin sought with her to be , With the dewy-eyed , with shimmering hair , And a pet as white as its mistress was fair . A. C. Wilkie .</p>
