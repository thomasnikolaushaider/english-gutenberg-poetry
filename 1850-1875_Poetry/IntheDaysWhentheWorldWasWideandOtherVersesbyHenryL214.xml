    <docTitle><titlePart>[ Note on content : Banjo Paterson and Henry Lawson were writing for the Sydney ‘ Bulletin ’ in 1892 when Lawson suggested a ‘ duel ’ of poetry to increase the number of poems they could sell to the paper . It was apparently entered into in all fun , though there are reports that Lawson was bitter about it later . ‘ Up the Country ’ and ‘ The City Bushman ’ , included in this selection , were two of Lawson 's contributions to the debate . Please note that this is the revised edition of 1900 . Therefore , even though this book was originally published in 1896 , it includes two poems not published until 1899 ( ‘ The Sliprails and the Spur ’ and ‘ Past Carin'’ ) . ]</titlePart></docTitle>

    <head>PREFACE</head>
    <p n="1">Most of the verses contained in this volume were first published in the Sydney ‘ Bulletin ’ ; others in the Brisbane ‘ Boomerang ’ , Sydney ‘ Freeman 's Journal ’ , ‘ Town and Country Journal ’ , ‘ Worker ’ , and ‘ New Zealand Mail ’ , whose editors and proprietors I desire to thank for past kindnesses and for present courtesy in granting me the right of reproduction in book form .</p>
    <p n="2">‘ In the Days When the World was Wide ’ was written in Maoriland and some of the other verses in Victoria , Queensland and Western Australia .</p>
    <p n="3">The dates of original publication are given in the Table of Contents . Those undated are now printed for the first time .</p>
    <p n="4">HENRY LAWSON .</p>
    <p n="5">To J. F. Archibald</p>
    <p n="6">To an Old Mate</p>
    <p n="7">Old Mate ! In the gusty old weather , When our hopes and our troubles were new , In the years spent in wearing out leather , I found you unselfish and true — I have gathered these verses together For the sake of our friendship and you .</p>
    <p n="8">You may think for awhile , and with reason , Though still with a kindly regret , That I 've left it full late in the season To prove I remember you yet ; But you 'll never judge me by their treason Who profit by friends — and forget .</p>
    <p n="9">I remember , Old Man , I remember — The tracks that we followed are clear — The jovial last nights of December , The solemn first days of the year , Long tramps through the clearings and timber , Short partings on platform and pier .</p>
    <p n="10">I can still feel the spirit that bore us , And often the old stars will shine — I remember the last spree in chorus For the sake of that other Lang Syne , When the tracks lay divided before us , Your path through the future and mine .</p>
    <p n="11">Through the frost-wind that cut like whip-lashes , Through the ever-blind haze of the drought — And in fancy at times by the flashes Of light in the darkness of doubt — I have followed the tent poles and ashes Of camps that we moved further out .</p>
    <p n="12">You will find in these pages a trace of That side of our past which was bright , And recognise sometimes the face of A friend who has dropped out of sight — I send them along in the place of The letters I promised to write .</p>

     <l n="1">The world is narrow and ways are short , and our lives are dull and slow ,</l>
     <l n="2">For little is new where the crowds resort , and less where the wanderers go ;</l>
     <l n="3">Greater , or smaller , the same old things we see by the dull road-side —</l>
     <l n="4">And tired of all is the spirit that sings</l>
     <l n="5">of the days when the world was wide .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="6">When the North was hale in the march of Time ,</l>
     <l n="7">and the South and the West were new ,</l>
     <l n="8">And the gorgeous East was a pantomime , as it seemed in our boyhood 's view ;</l>
     <l n="9">When Spain was first on the waves of change ,</l>
     <l n="10">and proud in the ranks of pride ,</l>
     <l n="11">And all was wonderful , new and strange in the days when the world was wide .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="12">Then a man could fight if his heart were bold ,</l>
     <l n="13">and win if his faith were true —</l>
     <l n="14">Were it love , or honour , or power , or gold , or all that our hearts pursue ;</l>
     <l n="15">Could live to the world for the family name , or die for the family pride ,</l>
     <l n="16">Could fly from sorrow , and wrong , and shame</l>
     <l n="17">in the days when the world was wide .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="18">They sailed away in the ships that sailed ere science controlled the main ,</l>
     <l n="19">When the strong , brave heart of a man prevailed</l>
     <l n="20">as ‘ twill never prevail again ;</l>
     <l n="21">They knew not whither , nor much they cared —</l>
     <l n="22">let Fate or the winds decide —</l>
     <l n="23">The worst of the Great Unknown they dared</l>
     <l n="24">in the days when the world was wide .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="25">They raised new stars on the silent sea that filled their hearts with awe ;</l>
     <l n="26">They came to many a strange countree and marvellous sights they saw .</l>
     <l n="27">The villagers gaped at the tales they told ,</l>
     <l n="28">and old eyes glistened with pride —</l>
     <l n="29">When barbarous cities were paved with gold</l>
     <l n="30">in the days when the world was wide .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="31">‘ Twas honest metal and honest wood , in the days of the Outward Bound ,</l>
     <l n="32">When men were gallant and ships were good — roaming the wide world round .</l>
     <l n="33">The gods could envy a leader then when ‘ Follow me , lads ! ’ he cried —</l>
     <l n="34">They faced each other and fought like men</l>
     <l n="35">in the days when the world was wide .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="36">They tried to live as a freeman should — they were happier men than we ,</l>
     <l n="37">In the glorious days of wine and blood , when Liberty crossed the sea ;</l>
     <l n="38">‘ Twas a comrade true or a foeman then , and a trusty sword well tried —</l>
     <l n="39">They faced each other and fought like men</l>

     <l n="41">The good ship bound for the Southern seas when the beacon was Ballarat ,</l>

     <l n="47">South , East , and West in advance of Time — and , ay ! in advance of Thought</l>
     <l n="48">Those brave men rose to a height sublime — and is it for this they fought ?</l>
     <l n="49">And is it for this damned life we praise the god-like spirit that died</l>
     <l n="50">At Eureka Stockade in the Roaring Days</l>
     <l n="51">with the days when the world was wide ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="52">We fight like women , and feel as much ; the thoughts of our hearts we guard ;</l>
     <l n="53">Where scarcely the scorn of a god could touch ,</l>
     <l n="54">the sneer of a sneak hits hard ;</l>
     <l n="55">The treacherous tongue and cowardly pen , the weapons of curs , decide —</l>
     <l n="56">They faced each other and fought like men</l>
     <l n="57">in the days when the world was wide .</l>
    </lg>

     <l n="58">Think of it all — of the life that is ! Study your friends and foes !</l>
     <l n="59">Study the past ! And answer this : ‘ Are these times better than those ? ’</l>
     <l n="60">The life-long quarrel , the paltry spite , the sting of your poisoned pride !</l>
     <l n="61">No matter who fell it were better to fight</l>

     <l n="64">The lines of suspicion on friendship 's brow</l>
     <l n="65">were traced since the days gone by .</l>
     <l n="66">There was room in the long , free lines of the van</l>
     <l n="67">to fight for it side by side —</l>
     <l n="68">There was beating-room for the heart of a man</l>

     <l n="95">To the scrape of restless feet ;</l>

     <l n="421">Though in point of education I am nothing but a dunce ,</l>
     <l n="422">I myself — you may n't believe it — helped to run a paper once</l>
     <l n="423">With a chap on Cambaroora , by the name of Charlie Brown ,</l>
     <l n="424">And I 'll tell you all about it if you 'll take the story down .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="80">
     <l n="425">On a golden day in summer , when the sunrays were aslant ,</l>
     <l n="426">Brown arrived in Cambaroora with a little printing plant</l>
     <l n="427">And his worldly goods and chattels — rather damaged on the way —</l>
     <l n="428">And a weary-looking woman who was following the dray .</l>
     <l n="429">He had bought an empty humpy , and , instead of getting tight ,</l>
     <l n="430">Why , the diggers heard him working like a lunatic all night :</l>
     <l n="431">And next day a sign of canvas , writ in characters of tar ,</l>
     <l n="432">Claimed the humpy as the office of the CAMBAROORA STAR .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="81">
     <l n="433">Well , I cannot read , that 's honest , but I had a digger friend</l>
     <l n="434">Who would read the paper to me from the title to the end ;</l>
     <l n="435">And the STAR contained a leader running thieves and spielers down ,</l>
     <l n="436">With a slap against claim-jumping , and a poem made by Brown .</l>
     <l n="437">Once I showed it to a critic , and he said ‘ twas very fine ,</l>
     <l n="438">Though he was n't long in finding glaring faults in every line ;</l>
     <l n="439">But it was a song of Freedom — all the clever critic said</l>
     <l n="440">Could n't stop that song from ringing , ringing , ringing in my head .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="82">
     <l n="441">So I went where Brown was working in his little hut hard by :</l>

     <l n="443">‘ I have studied on your leader , I agree with what you say ,</l>
     <l n="444">You have struck the bed-rock certain , and there ai n't no get-away ;</l>
     <l n="445">Your paper 's just the thumper for a young and growing land ,</l>
     <l n="446">And your principles is honest , Brown ; I want to shake your hand ,</l>
     <l n="447">And if there 's any lumping in connection with the STAR ,</l>
     <l n="448">Well , I 'll find the time to do it , and I 'll help you — there you are ! ’</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="83">
     <l n="449">Brown was every inch a digger ( bronzed and bearded in the South ) ,</l>

     <l n="451">When he took the hand I gave him ; and he gripped it like a vice ,</l>
     <l n="452">While he tried his best to thank me , and he stuttered once or twice .</l>
     <l n="453">But there was n't need for talking — we 'd the same old loves and hates ,</l>
     <l n="454">And we understood each other — Charlie Brown and I were mates .</l>
     <l n="455">So we worked a little ‘ paddock ’ on a place they called the ‘ Bar ’ ,</l>

     <l n="459">Well , I did n't shirk my promise , and I helped the thing , I guess ,</l>
     <l n="460">For at night I worked the lever of the crazy printing-press ;</l>
     <l n="461">Brown himself would do the feeding , and the missus used to ‘ fly ’ —</l>
     <l n="462">She is flying with the angels , if there 's justice up on high ,</l>

     <l n="466">Lord , that press ! It was a jumper — we could seldom get it right ,</l>
     <l n="467">And were lucky if we averaged a hundred in the night .</l>
     <l n="468">Many nights we 'd sit together in the windy hut and fold ,</l>
     <l n="469">And I helped the thing a little when I struck a patch of gold ;</l>
     <l n="470">And we battled for the diggers as the papers seldom do ,</l>
     <l n="471">Though when the diggers errored , why , we touched the diggers too .</l>
     <l n="472">Yet the paper took the fancy of that roaring mining town ,</l>
     <l n="473">And the diggers sent a nugget with their sympathy to Brown .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="87">
     <l n="474">Oft I sat and smoked beside him in the listening hours of night ,</l>
     <l n="475">When the shadows from the corners seemed to gather round the light —</l>
     <l n="476">When his weary , aching fingers , closing stiffly round the pen ,</l>
     <l n="477">Wrote defiant truth in language that could touch the hearts of men —</l>
     <l n="478">Wrote until his eyelids shuddered — wrote until the East was grey :</l>
     <l n="479">Wrote the stern and awful lessons that were taught him in his day ;</l>
     <l n="480">And they knew that he was honest , and they read his smallest par ,</l>
     <l n="481">For I think the diggers ’ Bible was the CAMBAROORA STAR .</l>

     <l n="485">Had a sentinel to guard it in the CAMBAROORA STAR .</l>
     <l n="486">There was strife about the Chinamen , who came in days of old</l>
     <l n="487">Like a swarm of thieves and loafers when the diggers found the gold —</l>
     <l n="488">Like the sneaking fortune-hunters who are always found behind ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="89">
     <l n="490">Charlie wrote a slinging leader , calling on his digger mates ,</l>

     <l n="493">Get a move upon the Chinkies when you 've got an hour to spare . ’</l>
     <l n="494">It was nine o'clock next morning when the Chows began to swarm ,</l>
     <l n="495">But they were n't so long in going , for the diggers ’ blood was warm .</l>
     <l n="496">Then the diggers held a meeting , and they shouted : ‘ Hip hoorar !</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="90">
     <l n="498">But the Cambaroora petered , and the diggers ’ sun went down ,</l>

     <l n="500">The reefing was conducted by a syndicate or two ,</l>
     <l n="501">And they changed the name to ‘ Queensville ’ , for their blood was very blue .</l>
     <l n="502">They wanted Brown to help them put the feathers in their nests ,</l>
     <l n="503">But his leaders went like thunder for their vested interests ,</l>
     <l n="504">And he fought for right and justice and he raved about the dawn</l>
     <l n="505">Of the reign of Man and Reason till his ads . were all withdrawn .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="91">
     <l n="506">He was offered shares for nothing in the richest of the mines ,</l>

     <l n="508">They abused him for his leaders , and they parodied his rhymes ,</l>
     <l n="509">And they told him that his paper was a mile behind the times .</l>
     <l n="510">‘ Let the times alone , ’ said Charlie , ‘ they 're all right , you need n't fret ;</l>
     <l n="511">For I started long before them , and they have n't caught me yet .</l>
     <l n="512">But , ’ says he to me , ‘ they 're coming , and they 're not so very far —</l>

   <p>THE ACADEMY : “ These ballads ( for such they mostly are ) abound in spirit and manhood , in the colour and smell of Australian soil . They deserve the popularity which they have won in Australia , and which , we trust , this edition will now give them in England . ”</p>
   <p>THE SPEAKER : “ There are poems in ‘ In the Days When the World was Wide ’ which are of a higher mood than any yet heard in distinctively Australian poetry . ”</p>
   <p>LITERARY WORLD : “ Not a few of the pieces have made us feel discontented with our sober surroundings , and desirous of seeing new birds , new landscapes , new stars ; for at times the blood tingles because of Mr. Lawson 's galloping rhymes . ”</p>
   <p>NEWCASTLE WEEKLY CHRONICLE : “ Swinging , rhythmic verse . ”</p>

    <head>WHILE THE BILLY BOILS .</head>
     <l n="1">By Henry Lawson .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>THE ACADEMY : “ A book of honest , direct , sympathetic , humorous writing about Australia from within is worth a library of travellers ’ tales . . . . The result is a real book — a book in a hundred . His language is terse , supple , and richly idiomatic . He can tell a yarn with the best . ”</p>
   <p>THE SCOTSMAN : “ There is no lack of dramatic imagination in the construction of the tales ; and the best of them contrive to construct a strong sensational situation in a couple of pages . But the chief charm and value of the book is its fidelity to the rough character of the scenes from which it is drawn . ”</p>
   <p>LITERATURE : “ These sketches bring us into contact with one phase of colonial life at first hand . . . . The simplicity of the narrative gives it almost the effect of a story that is told by word of mouth . ”</p>
   <p>THE SPECTATOR : “ It is strange that one we would venture to call the greatest Australian writer should be practically unknown in England . Mr. Lawson is a less experienced writer than Mr. Kipling , and more unequal , but there are two or three sketches in this volume which for vigour and truth can hold their own with even so great a rival . Both men have somehow gained that power of concentration which by a few strong strokes can set place and people before you with amazing force . ”</p>
   <p>THE TIMES : “ A collection of short and vigorous studies and stories of Australian life and character . A little in Bret Harte 's manner , crossed , perhaps , with that of Guy de Maupassant . ”</p>
   <p>BRITISH WEEKLY : “ Many of Mr. Lawson 's tales photograph life at the diggings or in the bush with an incisive and remorseless reality that grips the imagination . He silhouettes a swagman in a couple of pages , and the man is there , alive . ”</p>
   <p>THE MORNING POST : “ For the most part they are full of local colour , and , correctly speaking , represent rather rapid sketches illustrative of life in the bush than tales in the ordinary sense of the word . . . . They bear the impress of truth , sincere if unvarnished . ”</p>
   <p>A few other titles by Henry Lawson :</p>

   </lg>
   <p>THE BOOK LOVER : “ Any book of Lawson 's should be bought and treasured by all who care for the real beginnings of Australian literature . As a matter of fact , he is the one Australian literary product , in any distinctive sense . ”</p>
