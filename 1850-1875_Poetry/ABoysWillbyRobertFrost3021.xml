     <l n="30">ONE of my wishes is that those dark trees ,</l>
     <l n="31">So old and firm they scarcely show the breeze ,</l>
     <l n="32">Were not , as ‘ twere , the merest mask of gloom ,</l>
     <l n="33">But stretched away unto the edge of doom .</l>
     <l n="34">I should not be withheld but that some day</l>
     <l n="35">Into their vastness I should steal away ,</l>
     <l n="36">Fearless of ever finding open land ,</l>
     <l n="37">Or highway where the slow wheel pours the sand .</l>
     <l n="38">I do not see why I should e'er turn back ,</l>
     <l n="39">Or those should not set forth upon my track</l>
     <l n="40">To overtake me , who should miss me here</l>
     <l n="41">And long to know if still I held them dear .</l>
     <l n="42">They would not find me changed from him they knew —</l>
     <l n="43">Only more sure of all I thought was true .</l>

     <l n="44">Ghost House</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="45">I DWELL in a lonely house I know</l>
     <l n="46">That vanished many a summer ago ,</l>
     <l n="47">And left no trace but the cellar walls ,</l>
     <l n="48">And a cellar in which the daylight falls ,</l>
     <l n="49">And the purple-stemmed wild raspberries grow .</l>
     <l n="50">O'er ruined fences the grape-vines shield</l>
     <l n="51">The woods come back to the mowing field ;</l>
     <l n="52">The orchard tree has grown one copse</l>
     <l n="53">Of new wood and old where the woodpecker chops ;</l>
     <l n="54">The footpath down to the well is healed .</l>
     <l n="55">I dwell with a strangely aching heart</l>
     <l n="56">In that vanished abode there far apart</l>
     <l n="57">On that disused and forgotten road</l>
     <l n="58">That has no dust-bath now for the toad .</l>
     <l n="59">Night comes ; the black bats tumble and dart ;</l>
     <l n="60">The whippoorwill is coming to shout</l>
     <l n="61">And hush and cluck and flutter about :</l>
     <l n="62">I hear him begin far enough away</l>
     <l n="63">Full many a time to say his say</l>
     <l n="64">Before he arrives to say it out .</l>
     <l n="65">It is under the small , dim , summer star .</l>
     <l n="66">I know not who these mute folk are</l>
     <l n="67">Who share the unlit place with me —</l>
     <l n="68">Those stones out under the low-limbed tree</l>
     <l n="69">Doubtless bear names that the mosses mar .</l>
     <l n="70">They are tireless folk , but slow and sad ,</l>
     <l n="71">Though two , close-keeping , are lass and lad ,—</l>
     <l n="72">With none among them that ever sings ,</l>
     <l n="73">And yet , in view of how many things ,</l>
     <l n="74">As sweet companions as might be had .</l>

     <l n="76">MY Sorrow , when she 's here with me ,</l>
     <l n="77">Thinks these dark days of autumn rain</l>
     <l n="78">Are beautiful as days can be ;</l>
     <l n="79">She loves the bare , the withered tree ;</l>
     <l n="80">She walks the sodden pasture lane .</l>
     <l n="81">Her pleasure will not let me stay .</l>
     <l n="82">She talks and I am fain to list :</l>
     <l n="83">She 's glad the birds are gone away ,</l>
     <l n="84">She 's glad her simple worsted gray</l>
     <l n="85">Is silver now with clinging mist .</l>
     <l n="86">The desolate , deserted trees ,</l>
     <l n="87">The faded earth , the heavy sky ,</l>
     <l n="88">The beauties she so truly sees ,</l>
     <l n="89">She thinks I have no eye for these ,</l>
     <l n="90">And vexes me for reason why .</l>
     <l n="91">Not yesterday I learned to know</l>
     <l n="92">The love of bare November days</l>
     <l n="93">Before the coming of the snow ,</l>
     <l n="94">But it were vain to tell her so ,</l>
     <l n="95">And they are better for her praise .</l>

     <l n="96">Love and a Question</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="97">A STRANGER came to the door at eve ,</l>
     <l n="98">And he spoke the bridegroom fair .</l>
     <l n="99">He bore a green-white stick in his hand ,</l>
     <l n="100">And , for all burden , care .</l>
     <l n="101">He asked with the eyes more than the lips</l>
     <l n="102">For a shelter for the night ,</l>
     <l n="103">And he turned and looked at the road afar</l>
     <l n="104">Without a window light .</l>
     <l n="105">The bridegroom came forth into the porch</l>
     <l n="106">With , ‘ Let us look at the sky ,</l>
     <l n="107">And question what of the night to be ,</l>
     <l n="108">Stranger , you and I . ’</l>
     <l n="109">The woodbine leaves littered the yard ,</l>
     <l n="110">The woodbine berries were blue ,</l>
     <l n="111">Autumn , yes , winter was in the wind ;</l>
     <l n="112">‘ Stranger , I wish I knew . ’</l>
     <l n="113">Within , the bride in the dusk alone</l>
     <l n="114">Bent over the open fire ,</l>
     <l n="115">Her face rose-red with the glowing coal</l>
     <l n="116">And the thought of the heart 's desire .</l>
     <l n="117">The bridegroom looked at the weary road ,</l>
     <l n="118">Yet saw but her within ,</l>
     <l n="119">And wished her heart in a case of gold</l>
     <l n="120">And pinned with a silver pin .</l>
     <l n="121">The bridegroom thought it little to give</l>
     <l n="122">A dole of bread , a purse ,</l>
     <l n="123">A heartfelt prayer for the poor of God ,</l>
     <l n="124">Or for the rich a curse ;</l>
     <l n="125">But whether or not a man was asked</l>
     <l n="126">To mar the love of two</l>
     <l n="127">By harboring woe in the bridal house ,</l>
     <l n="128">The bridegroom wished he knew .</l>

     <l n="130">WHEN I go up through the mowing field ,</l>
     <l n="131">The headless aftermath ,</l>
     <l n="132">Smooth-laid like thatch with the heavy dew ,</l>
     <l n="133">Half closes the garden path .</l>
     <l n="134">And when I come to the garden ground ,</l>
     <l n="135">The whir of sober birds</l>
     <l n="136">Up from the tangle of withered weeds</l>
     <l n="137">Is sadder than any words .</l>
     <l n="138">A tree beside the wall stands bare ,</l>
     <l n="139">But a leaf that lingered brown ,</l>
     <l n="140">Disturbed , I doubt not , by my thought ,</l>
     <l n="141">Comes softly rattling down .</l>
     <l n="142">I end not far from my going forth</l>
     <l n="143">By picking the faded blue</l>
     <l n="144">Of the last remaining aster flower</l>
     <l n="145">To carry again to you .</l>

     <l n="150">When wintry winds do blow !—</l>
     <l n="151">As if with keenness for our fate ,</l>
     <l n="152">Our faltering few steps on</l>
     <l n="153">To white rest , and a place of rest</l>
     <l n="154">Invisible at dawn ,—</l>
     <l n="155">And yet with neither love nor hate ,</l>

     <l n="173">Dooryard and road ungraded ,</l>

     <l n="538">Not to strike a blow for God</l>
     <l n="539">Before he made his errand sure .</l>
     <l n="540">And ever it was intended so ,</l>

     <l n="549">As bring his body safe away —</l>
     <l n="550">Only a signal deed to do</l>
     <l n="551">And a last sounding word to say .</l>
     <l n="552">The heart he wore in a golden chain</l>
     <l n="553">He swung and flung forth into the plain ,</l>
     <l n="554">And followed it crying ‘ Heart or death ! ’</l>
     <l n="555">And fighting over it perished fain .</l>
     <l n="556">So may another do of right ,</l>
     <l n="557">Give a heart to the hopeless fight ,</l>
     <l n="558">The more of right the more he loves ;</l>
     <l n="559">So may another redouble might</l>
     <l n="560">For a few swift gleams of the angry brand ,</l>
     <l n="561">Scorning greatly not to demand</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="51">
     <l n="565">I WENT to turn the grass once after one</l>
     <l n="566">Who mowed it in the dew before the sun .</l>
     <l n="567">The dew was gone that made his blade so keen</l>
     <l n="568">Before I came to view the leveled scene .</l>
     <l n="569">I looked for him behind an isle of trees ;</l>
     <l n="570">I listened for his whetstone on the breeze .</l>
     <l n="571">But he had gone his way , the grass all mown ,</l>
     <l n="572">And I must be , as he had been ,— alone ,</l>
     <l n="573">‘ As all must be , ’ I said within my heart ,</l>
     <l n="574">‘ Whether they work together or apart . ’</l>
     <l n="575">But as I said it , swift there passed me by</l>
     <l n="576">On noiseless wing a ‘ wildered butterfly ,</l>
     <l n="577">Seeking with memories grown dim o'er night</l>
     <l n="578">Some resting flower of yesterday 's delight .</l>
     <l n="579">And once I marked his flight go round and round ,</l>
     <l n="580">As where some flower lay withering on the ground .</l>
     <l n="581">And then he flew as far as eye could see ,</l>
     <l n="582">And then on tremulous wing came back to me .</l>
     <l n="583">I thought of questions that have no reply ,</l>
     <l n="584">And would have turned to toss the grass to dry ;</l>
     <l n="585">But he turned first , and led my eye to look</l>
     <l n="586">At a tall tuft of flowers beside a brook ,</l>
     <l n="587">A leaping tongue of bloom the scythe had spared</l>
     <l n="588">Beside a reedy brook the scythe had bared .</l>
     <l n="589">I left my place to know them by their name ,</l>
     <l n="590">Finding them butterfly weed when I came .</l>
     <l n="591">The mower in the dew had loved them thus ,</l>
     <l n="592">By leaving them to flourish , not for us ,</l>
     <l n="593">Nor yet to draw one thought of ours to him .</l>
     <l n="594">But from sheer morning gladness at the brim .</l>
     <l n="595">The butterfly and I had lit upon ,</l>
     <l n="596">Nevertheless , a message from the dawn ,</l>
     <l n="597">That made me hear the wakening birds around ,</l>
     <l n="598">And hear his long scythe whispering to the ground ,</l>
     <l n="599">And feel a spirit kindred to my own ;</l>
     <l n="600">So that henceforth I worked no more alone ;</l>
     <l n="601">But glad with him , I worked as with his aid ,</l>
     <l n="602">And weary , sought at noon with him the shade ;</l>
     <l n="603">And dreaming , as it were , held brotherly speech</l>
     <l n="604">With one whose thought I had not hoped to reach .</l>
     <l n="605">‘ Men work together , ’ I told him from the heart ,</l>
