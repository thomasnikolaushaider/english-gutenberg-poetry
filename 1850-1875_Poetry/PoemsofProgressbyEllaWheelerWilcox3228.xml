    <head>PREFACE : LOVE 'S LANGUAGE</head>
    <p n="1">When silence flees before the voice of Love , Of what expression does that god approve ? Is dulcet song or flowing verse his choice , Or stately prose , made regal by his voice ? Speaks Love in couplets , or in epics grand ? And is Love humble , or does he command ?</p>
    <p n="2">There is no language that Love does not speak : To-day commanding and to-morrow meek , One hour laconic and the next verbose , With hope triumphant and with doubt morose , His varying moods all forms of speech employ . To give expression to his painful joy ,</p>
    <p n="3">To voice the phases of his joyful pain , He rings the changes on the poet 's strain . Yet not in epic , epigram or verse Can Love the passion of his heart rehearse . All speech , all language , is inadequate , There are no words with Love commensurate .</p>

     <head>THE LAND BETWEEN</head>
     <lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="2">Between the little Here and larger Yonder ,</l>
       <l n="3">There is a realm ( or so one day I read )</l>
       <l n="4">Where faithful spirits love-enchained may wander ,</l>
       <l n="5">Till some remembering soul from earth has fled .</l>
       <l n="6">Then , reunited , they go forth afar ,</l>
       <l n="7">From sphere to sphere , where wondrous angels are .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="8">Not many spirits in that realm are waiting ;</l>
       <l n="9">Not many pause upon its shores to rest ;</l>
       <l n="10">For only love , intense and unabating ,</l>
       <l n="11">Can hold them from the longer , higher quest .</l>
       <l n="12">And after grief has wept itself to sleep ,</l>
       <l n="13">Few hearts on earth their vital memories keep .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="14">Should I pass on , across the mystic border ,</l>
       <l n="15">Let thy love link me to that pallid land ;</l>
       <l n="16">I would not seek the heavens of finer order</l>
       <l n="17">Until thy barque had left this coarser strand .</l>
       <l n="18">How desolate such journeyings would be ,</l>
       <l n="19">Though straight to Him , were they not shared by thee .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="20">Wert thou first called ( dear God , how could I bear it ? )</l>
       <l n="21">I should enchain thee with my love , I know .</l>
       <l n="22">Not great enough am I to free thy spirit</l>
       <l n="23">From all these tender ties , and bid thee go .</l>
       <l n="24">Nor would a soul , unselfish as thine own ,</l>
       <l n="25">Forget so soon , and speed to heaven alone .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="26">On earth we find no joy in ways diverging ;</l>
       <l n="27">How could we find it in the worlds unseen ?</l>
       <l n="28">I know old memories from my bosom surging ,</l>
       <l n="29">Would keep thee waiting in that Land Between ,</l>
       <l n="30">Until together , side by side , we trod</l>
       <l n="31">A path of stars , in our great search for God .</l>

      <head>LOVE 'S MIRAGE</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">Midway upon the route , he paused athirst</l>
       <l n="2">And suddenly across the wastes of heat ,</l>
       <l n="3">He saw cool waters gleaming , and a sweet</l>
       <l n="4">Green oasis upon his vision burst .</l>
       <l n="5">A tender dream , long in his bosom nursed ,</l>
       <l n="6">Spread love 's illusive verdure for his feet ;</l>
       <l n="7">The barren sands changed into golden wheat ;</l>
       <l n="8">The way grew glad that late had seemed accursed .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="9">She shone , the woman wonder , on his soul ;</l>
       <l n="10">The garden spot , for which men toil and wait ;</l>
       <l n="11">The house of rest , that is each heart 's demand ;</l>
       <l n="12">But when , at last , he reached the gleaming goal ,</l>
       <l n="13">He found , oh , cruel irony of fate ,</l>
       <l n="14">But desert sun upon the desert sand .</l>

       <l n="1">I know the need of the world ,</l>
       <l n="2">Though it would not have me know .</l>
       <l n="3">It would hide its sorrow deep ,</l>
       <l n="4">Where only God may go .</l>
       <l n="5">Yet its secret it can not keep ;</l>
       <l n="6">It tells it awake , or asleep ,</l>
       <l n="7">It tells it to all who will heed ,</l>
       <l n="8">And he who runs may read .</l>

       <l n="10">I know the need of the world ,</l>

       <l n="16">In a sob and a smothered moan ,</l>
       <l n="17">And it weeps when it sits alone .</l>

       <l n="24">And the wrong way seems the right ;</l>
       <l n="25">When he who slaughters the most</l>

       <l n="37">The need of the world is love .</l>
       <l n="38">Deep under the pride of power ,</l>
       <l n="39">Down under its lust of greed ,</l>
       <l n="40">For the joys that last but an hour ,</l>
       <l n="41">There lies forever its need .</l>
       <l n="42">For love is the law and the creed</l>
       <l n="43">And love is the unnamed goal</l>
       <l n="44">Of life , from man to the mole .</l>
       <l n="45">Love is the need of the world .</l>

      <head>THE BREAKING OF CHAINS</head>
       <l n="1">Between the ringing of bells and the musical clang of chimes</l>
       <l n="2">I hear a sound like the breaking of chains , all through these</l>

     <p>And the eyes of the world are opening wide , and great are the truths they see ; And the heart of the world is singing a song , and its burden is ‘ Be free ! ’ Now the thought of the world and the wish of the world and the song of the world will make A force so strong that the fetters forged for a million years must break .</p>

       <l n="9">The race no longer bends beneath the weight of Adam 's sin ,</l>
       <l n="10">But stands erect and knows itself the Maker 's first of kin .</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>And the need of the world and the wish of the world and the song of the world I hear , All through the clanging and clashing of bells , this Christmas time o ’ the year ; And I hear a sound like the breaking of chains , and it seems to say to me , In the voice of One who spoke of old , ‘ The Truth shall make men free . ’</p>

      <head>IN AN OLD ART GALLERY</head>
       <l n="1">Before the statue of a giant Hun ,</l>

     <p>Strange , as he gazed , that from a vanished past No memories revived of war and strife , Of misused prowess , and of broken law . That old Hun 's spirit , in the dwarf re-cast , Lived out the sequence of an earthly life . IT WAS THE STATUE OF HIMSELF HE SAW !</p>

       <l n="14">Union and Arbitration supersede</l>
       <l n="15">The hell-created implements of War .</l>
       <l n="16">Disarm the world ! and bid destructive thought</l>
       <l n="17">Slip like a serpent from the mortal mind</l>
       <l n="18">Down through the marshes of oblivion . Soon</l>
       <l n="19">A race of gods shall rise ! Disarm ! Disarm !</l>

      <head>THE CALL</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">All wantonly in hours of joy ,</l>
       <l n="2">I made a song of pain .</l>
       <l n="3">Soon Grief drew near , and paused to hear ,</l>
       <l n="4">And sang the sad refrain ,</l>
       <l n="5">Again and yet again .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="6">Then recklessly in my despair ,</l>
       <l n="7">I sang of hope one day .</l>
       <l n="8">And Joy turned back upon life 's track ,</l>
       <l n="9">And smiled , and came my way ,</l>
       <l n="10">And sat her down to stay .</l>

      <head>A LITTLE SONG</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">Oh , a great world , a fair world , a true world I find it ;</l>
       <l n="2">A sun that never forgets to rise ,</l>
       <l n="3">On the darkest night , a star in the skies ,</l>
       <l n="4">And a God of love behind it .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="5">Oh , a good life , a sweet life , a large life I take it ,</l>
       <l n="6">Is what He offers to you , and me ;</l>
       <l n="7">A chance to do , and a chance to be ,</l>
       <l n="8">Whatever we chose to make it .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="9">Oh , a far way , a high way , a sure way He leads us ;</l>
       <l n="10">And if the journey at times seems long ,</l>
       <l n="11">We must trudge ahead , with a trustful song ,</l>
       <l n="12">And know at the end He needs us .</l>
