       <l n="2">What shall we do with our day ? you ask —</l>
       <l n="3">A June day fair to the heart 's desire —</l>
       <l n="4">Lie in the meadow , and lounge and bask</l>
       <l n="5">Over books and tobacco ? Or do you aspire</l>
       <l n="6">To conquer the summit that yesterday</l>
       <l n="7">We marked for our own ere your visit end ?</l>
       <l n="8">Or shall we go riding , or fishing ? Nay ,</l>
       <l n="9">For the scent of the sea 's on the air , my friend .</l>
       <l n="10">We shall go to the head of the reedy lake ,</l>
       <l n="11">And there , in a brake by a fir-grove , find</l>
       <l n="12">Two long canoes with arching deck ,</l>
       <l n="13">Sea-riders , strong for a day of wind ;</l>
       <l n="14">And oh , what a song shall the bright wind sing us</l>
       <l n="15">When clear of the shallows and clear of the sedge ,</l>
       <l n="16">While the narrowing stream and the ebb-tide swing us</l>
       <l n="17">‘ Twixt sea and mountain to Wicklow Bridge !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="18">But here beware ! for the ebb goes roaring</l>
       <l n="19">Through half the arches , and half are dry ,</l>
       <l n="20">And stakes and stones are ready for goring</l>
       <l n="21">Your Rob-Roy 's timbers as down you fly .</l>
       <l n="22">And beyond the Bridge , in the deep sea-current ,</l>
       <l n="23">Where the rope-maze crosses from quay to quay ,</l>
       <l n="24">You 'll need your head and your arm I warrant ,</l>
       <l n="25">To fight the eddies and find your way .</l>
       <l n="26">There lifts your prow with the long pulsation</l>
       <l n="27">That tells how near us the glad seas are !</l>
       <l n="28">There lifts the heart with the old elation ,</l>
       <l n="29">To meet the surf at the harbour-bar !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="30">The North wind marshals the ranks of ocean ,</l>
       <l n="31">And on they sweep with a strength serene ,</l>
       <l n="32">Till the tide-race ruffles the mighty motion</l>
       <l n="33">And curls the crests of the rollers green .</l>
       <l n="34">The breakers flash on the sand-bank yonder ,</l>
       <l n="35">And the cavern 'd curve of the rock-walled bay</l>
       <l n="36">Is loud with clamour of hoarse sea-thunder</l>
       <l n="37">As the wave recoils in a blast of spray .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="38">And I know a cleft among grim rock-masses ,</l>
       <l n="39">Where if wind blow strong and the light come fair ,</l>
       <l n="40">When the sea-cave roars and the spray-jet flashes ,</l>
       <l n="41">A rainbow floats in the sunny air .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="42">At the Head 's wild verge , where the tideways quicken ,</l>
       <l n="43">And eddies hollow the smooth sea-caves ,</l>
       <l n="44">Our Rob-Roys plunge as the breakers thicken ,</l>
       <l n="45">And bury their decks in the rearing waves .</l>
       <l n="46">We round the Point in the surge and welter</l>
       <l n="47">Of clashing billows and blinding foam —</l>
       <l n="48">Then mile on mile , in the cliff-wall 's shelter ,</l>
       <l n="49">In calm new seas to the South we roam .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="50">O bays of Wicklow , and gorse-crown 'd headlands</l>
       <l n="51">Whose scent blows far on the seaward breeze ,</l>
       <l n="52">How oft have I yearned in the tranquil midlands</l>
       <l n="53">For one brave shock of your lifting seas !</l>
       <l n="54">How oft it may be in days hereafter</l>
       <l n="55">Shall rise the thought of you , phantom-fair ,</l>
       <l n="56">Shall steal the sound of the sea-waves ’ laughter</l>
       <l n="57">On ears grown dull with time and care !</l>
       <l n="58">Waves , wash my spirit , and lonely places ,</l>
       <l n="59">If well I loved you , and aught you knew ,</l>
       <l n="60">Mark deep my heart with immortal traces</l>
       <l n="61">Of shining days when I dwelt with you !</l>

       <l n="1">Wind , O wind of the Spring , thine old enchantment renewing ,</l>
       <l n="2">How at the shock of thy might wakens within me a cry !</l>
       <l n="3">Out of what wonderful lands , never trodden by man , never told of ,</l>
       <l n="4">Lands where never a ship anchored or trafficker fared ,</l>
       <l n="5">Comest thou , breathing like flame till the brown earth flames into</l>
       <l n="6">blossom ,</l>
       <l n="7">Quick'ning the sap of old woods swayed in thy stormy embrace ,</l>
       <l n="8">Rousing in depths of the heart wild waves of an infinite longing ,</l>
       <l n="9">Longing for freedom and life , yearning for Springs that are dead !</l>
       <l n="10">Surely the far blue sea , foam-fleck 'd with the speed of thy coming</l>
       <l n="11">Brighten 'd in laughter abroad , sang at the feet of the isles ,</l>
       <l n="12">Sang in a tumult of joy as my soul sings trembling with passion ,</l>
       <l n="13">Trembling with passion and hope , wild with the spirit of Spring .</l>
       <l n="14">Ah , what dreams re-arise , half pain half bliss to remember ,</l>
       <l n="15">Hearing the storm of thy song blown from the height of the skies :—</l>
       <l n="16">Something remains upon earth to be done , to be dared , to be sought</l>
       <l n="17">for ,</l>
       <l n="18">Up with the anchor once more — out with the sails to the blast !</l>
       <l n="19">Out to the shock of the seas that encircle the Fortunate Islands ,</l>
       <l n="20">Vision that burns in the blood , home of the Wind of the Spring .</l>

       <l n="4">So leans her list'ning head ;</l>
       <l n="5">For once to fairy harping</l>
       <l n="6">She danced upon the hill ,</l>
       <l n="7">And through her brain and bosom</l>

     <head>THE GRAVE OF RURY</head>
     <p>Clear as air , the western waters evermore their sweet unchanging song Murmur in their stony channels round O'Conor ' s sepulchre in Cong .</p>
     <p>Crownless , hopeless , here he lingered ; felt the years go by him like a dream , Heard the far-off roar of conquest murmur faintly like the singing stream .</p>
     <p>Here he died , and here they tomb 'd him , men of Fechin , chanting round his grave . Did they know , ah , did they know it , what they buried by the babbling wave ?</p>
     <p>Now above the sleep of Rury holy things and great have passed away ; Stone by stone the stately Abbey falls and fades in passionless decay .</p>
     <p>Darkly grows the quiet ivy , pale the broken arches glimmer through ; Dark upon the cloister-garden dreams the shadow of the ancient yew .</p>
     <p>Through the roofless aisles the verdure flows , the meadow-sweet and foxglove bloom ; Earth , the mother and consoler , winds soft arms about the lonely tomb .</p>
     <p>Peace and holy gloom possess him , last of Gaelic monarchs of the Gael , Slumbering by the young , eternal river-voices of the western vale .</p>
     <p>Ruraidh O'Conchobhar , last High King of Ireland , spent the closing fifteen years of his life in the monastery of St. Fechin at Cong , Co. Mayo . His grave is still shown in that most beautiful and pathetic of Irish ruins . Some accounts have it that his remains were afterwards transferred to Clonmacnois by the Shannon .</p>

       <l n="1">In the heart of a German forest I followed the winding ways</l>

      <head>THE BATTLE OF SALAMIS</head>
       <l n="1">From “ The Persians ” of Aeschylus</l>
     </lg>
     <p>[ Except for inscriptions , this contemporary narrative of the Battle of Salamis is the earliest piece of written Greek history extant . The splendour and force of the original make it one of the greatest pieces of battle-narrative in the world , and defy adequate rendering . But it is noticeable that not only is the description ablaze with the passion of war , but the plan and tactics of the fight , which was probably even a more decisive event in world-history than that of Marathon , are given with a map-like precision and clearness .</p>
     <p>The narrative is placed in the mouth of a messenger sent by Xerxes to his mother , Atossa , to tell her of the catastrophe . I have followed the text of Paley . ]</p>

     <lg type="poem">
      <head>MESSENGER</head>
       <l n="1">Began ? Some Power malign began it all !</l>
       <l n="2">Some God that hated Persia . First , there came</l>
       <l n="3">A Greek deserter from the Athenian host .</l>
       <l n="4">“ Keep watch , ” he said , “ for at the dead of night</l>
       <l n="5">Our benches shall be manned , our fleet dispersed ;</l>
       <l n="6">They will escape you in the narrow seas . ”</l>
       <l n="7">This Xerxes heard , O Queen , and never saw</l>
       <l n="8">The Greek man 's guile , nor knew the Gods his foe .</l>
       <l n="9">To all the captains of the fleet he sent</l>
       <l n="10">This order : “ When the sun his fiery beams</l>
       <l n="11">Hath hidden from the earth , and night holds all</l>
       <l n="12">The empire of the air , then set your ships ,</l>
       <l n="13">Some ranged in threefold line to guard the friths</l>
       <l n="14">And close up all the roaring waterways ,</l>
       <l n="15">Some to patrol the Isle of Salamis .</l>
       <l n="16">And mark ye , should the Greeks escape their doom</l>
       <l n="17">By one unguarded outlet , ‘ tis decreed</l>
       <l n="18">Your heads shall fall for it . ” So spake the King ,</l>
       <l n="19">Haughty , infatuate , knowing not the end .</l>
       <l n="20">And dutifully they obeyed his word .</l>
       <l n="21">Supper was first prepared ; each oarsman then</l>
       <l n="22">Looked to his tholepin and bound fast the oar .</l>
       <l n="23">Then , as the sunlight faded from the earth ,</l>
       <l n="24">And night came on , the rowers went on board ,</l>
       <l n="25">And with them every well-trained fighting man ;</l>
       <l n="26">And soon from squadron unto squadron rolled</l>
       <l n="27">Down the vast lines the cheering of the fleet ,</l>
       <l n="28">As each one rowed to his appointed place .</l>
       <l n="29">So all night long the captains made us cruise</l>
       <l n="30">Hither and thither , every ship we had ;</l>
       <l n="31">And now the night was spent , yet never once</l>
       <l n="32">The Greeks had tried our watch in secret flight .</l>
       <l n="33">But when the white steeds of the God of Day</l>
       <l n="34">Mounted the sky , and light possessed the land ,</l>
       <l n="35">Then from the Greeks a mighty chant was borne ,</l>
       <l n="36">Triumphant , to our ears , and every cliff</l>
       <l n="37">Of sea-girt Salamis pealed back the strain .</l>
       <l n="38">And fear possessed us every one , O Queen ,</l>
       <l n="39">And staggering doubt ; for not as if in flight</l>
       <l n="40">Rose the great paean then among the Greeks ,</l>
       <l n="41">But as when brave men cheer themselves for fight .</l>
       <l n="42">Then the heart-kindling trumpet spake , and then</l>
       <l n="43">We heard the thunder of a thousand oars</l>
       <l n="44">That swung together at the steersman 's cry ,</l>
       <l n="45">And all at once the sounding furrows smote .</l>
       <l n="46">Then soon full clear their charging line we saw ,</l>
       <l n="47">The right wing leading , and the main array</l>
       <l n="48">A little after ; and ere long we heard</l>
       <l n="49">Such cries as these : “ On , children of the Greek !</l>
       <l n="50">Now for your fatherland , for freedom now !</l>
       <l n="51">For wife and child , and for your fathers ’ homes !</l>
       <l n="52">Now for the temples of your fathers ’ Gods !</l>
       <l n="53">To-day we fight for all ! ” So cried they still ,</l>
       <l n="54">Nor were we Persians dumb , but sent them back</l>
       <l n="55">Shouting for shouting . Little time there was</l>
       <l n="56">To range our lines , until the brazen beaks</l>
       <l n="57">Crash 'd in among us . First , a ship of Greece ,</l>
       <l n="58">Leading the onset , rent off all the prow</l>
       <l n="59">From a Phoenician . Each then sought a foe ;</l>
       <l n="60">And first we stemm 'd the torrent of their charge ,</l>
       <l n="61">But soon our multitudes in the narrow seas</l>
       <l n="62">Were thronged and hampered , nor could any now</l>
       <l n="63">Bear help to other — yea , and many a time</l>
       <l n="64">Friend hurtled upon friend , or rent away</l>
       <l n="65">With shearing prow her whole array of oars .</l>
       <l n="66">Meanwhile the Greeks around us fiercely charged</l>
       <l n="67">From every side at once ; the lighter barques</l>
       <l n="68">Were soon o'erset ; the very seas were hid ,</l>
       <l n="69">So strewn with wreck and slaughter ; every strand</l>
       <l n="70">And jutting rock-ledge was with corpses piled .</l>
       <l n="71">We pressed in ruinous disordered flight ,</l>
       <l n="72">All that was left of Persia 's mighty fleet ;</l>
       <l n="73">While they , like fishers when the tunnies swarm</l>
       <l n="74">Within some narrow inlet , slew amain</l>
       <l n="75">With aught that hand could seize — with shivered oars ,</l>
       <l n="76">Fragments of wreck , they stabb 'd , they stunn 'd , they clove ;</l>
       <l n="77">And out beyond the channel shrieks and wails</l>
       <l n="78">And panic fear possessed the open sea .</l>
       <l n="79">Gods ! could I speak , nor cease for ten full days ,</l>
       <l n="80">I had not told how thick disasters came !</l>
       <l n="81">Know this , that never since the world began</l>
       <l n="82">Perished in one day such a host of men !</l>

      <head>THE THREE RINGS : A FABLE</head>
       <l n="1">From Lessing 's “ Nathan der Weise "[ 6 ]</l>
     </lg>
     <p>[ Since Plato , no writer has understood better than Lessing the dramatic conduct of a philosophic dialogue . The following colloquy is a beautiful example of his art and of his thought .</p>
     <p>Nathan is a Jew , famed for his wealth and for his wisdom , living in Jerusalem at the time of the Third Crusade . In the following scene he has just been summoned to the presence of the Sultan Saladin . He supposes that a loan of money is the Sultan 's object . Instead of this , he finds that it is his reputed wisdom which has gained him the interview . Nathan is a man who cannot have taken his beliefs in spiritual things without examination ; here , then , says Saladin , are three faiths contending for mastery , the Jewish , the Christian , and the Mahommedan . Each claims to be the true and only true religion . The claim cannot be true of more than one of them . Which of them , in his inmost soul , does Nathan hold to be justified ? That he may have time to collect his thoughts , Saladin leaves the Jew alone for a while before he answers . Nathan , who does not yet know Saladin , is at first very doubtful of the bona fides of the Musalman prince in making this inquiry of him . ]</p>

       <l n="1">In the grey morn of Time , there lived i ’ the East</l>
       <l n="2">A man , who owned a ring of priceless worth ,</l>
       <l n="3">Gift of a well-loved hand . For stone it bore</l>
       <l n="4">An opal , where a hundred lovely tints</l>
       <l n="5">Played , and where dwelt the magic power to make</l>
       <l n="6">Well-pleasing in the sight of God and man</l>

       <l n="13">That he in turn should leave it to the son</l>

       <l n="5">He had the Ring — and so in truth he had —</l>
       <l n="6">After his father 's promise , long before ,</l>
       <l n="7">That one day he should own the Ring and all</l>
       <l n="8">Its rights — and this no less was true . The father ,</l>
       <l n="9">Each one averr 'd , could ne'er have played him false .</l>
       <l n="10">Rather than credit this — rather than nurse</l>
       <l n="11">Against so loved a father , such a thought ,</l>
       <l n="12">How fain soever he had been to think</l>
       <l n="13">Nothing but good of them , he must believe</l>
       <l n="14">His brothers guilty of foul treachery .</l>
       <l n="15">But surely one day he would find a way</l>
       <l n="16">To unmask the villains — he would be avenged !</l>

       <l n="2">What thou wilt put into his mouth . Speak on !</l>

       <l n="1">On this wise spake the Judge : “ Either ye bring</l>
       <l n="2">Right soon your father here before me , else</l>
       <l n="3">I spurn you from my seat . What ! think ye I</l>
       <l n="4">Am here to answer riddles ? Or do ye wait</l>
       <l n="5">Until the true Ring find a tongue and speak ?</l>
       <l n="6">Yet stay ! ‘ Tis said that in the true Ring lives</l>
       <l n="7">A magic gift , to make the owner loved —</l>
       <l n="8">Well-pleasing before God and man . So good ,</l>
       <l n="9">This shall decide the cause ; for never , surely ,</l>
       <l n="10">In this the false can emulate the true .</l>
       <l n="11">Which of the three of ye is best beloved</l>
       <l n="12">By the other twain ? Marry , speak out ! Ye are dumb !</l>
       <l n="13">Mysterious power , that only backward works ,</l>
       <l n="14">Not outward from within ! Lo , each of you</l>
       <l n="15">Loves best of all — himself ! So are ye all</l>
       <l n="16">Deceived , and all deceivers . All your rings</l>
       <l n="17">Are manifestly false . Belike the true</l>
       <l n="18">Was irrecoverably lost ; and so</l>
       <l n="19">Your father , to conceal the loss , made three</l>
       <l n="20">In place of one . ”</l>

       <l n="1">“ And so , ” the Judge continued , “ if ye now</l>
       <l n="2">Are bent on Law , on that alone , and counsel</l>
       <l n="3">Such as I can , will none — I bid you hence .</l>
       <l n="4">But , if I counselled you , my rede were this :</l>
       <l n="5">Take ye the matter simply as it lies .</l>
       <l n="6">Each from your father had his ring — let each</l>
       <l n="7">Be well persuaded that the ring he holds</l>
       <l n="8">Is the true Ring . It may be that your father</l>
       <l n="9">Was minded to maintain the tyranny</l>
       <l n="10">Of the one Ring no longer . And ‘ tis certain</l>
       <l n="11">He loved you all , and loved you each alike .</l>
       <l n="12">Would not have one exalted , one oppressed .</l>
       <l n="13">Mark that ! and be it yours to emulate</l>
       <l n="14">His great impartial love . Strive , each of you ,</l>
       <l n="15">To show the Ring 's benignant might his own ;</l>
       <l n="16">Yea , help the mystic power to do its kind ,</l>
       <l n="17">With gentleness , with loving courtesy ,</l>
       <l n="18">Beneficence to man , and unto God</l>
       <l n="19">The deep devotion of the inmost soul .</l>
       <l n="20">And when , full many a generation hence ,</l>
       <l n="21">Within your children 's children 's children 's hearts</l>
       <l n="22">The mystery of the Ring is manifest ,</l>
       <l n="23">Lo ! in a thousand thousand years , again</l>
       <l n="24">Before this judgment-seat I summon you ,</l>
       <l n="25">Where one more wise than I shall sit and speak .</l>
       <l n="26">Now go your ways . ” So spake the modest Judge .</l>
