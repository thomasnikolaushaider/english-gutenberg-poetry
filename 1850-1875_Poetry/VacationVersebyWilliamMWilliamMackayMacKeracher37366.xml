     <l n="1">MR. ROBERT McDOUGALL , B. A .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>My Dear Rob .— My intention when I left the country was , as you know , to publish a volume of some size , which should present among its contents the long poem which I wrote during the early part of my last vacation . The design has dwindled until it finds its execution in the publication of this little pamphlet , containing merely passages from that poem . Some of these you heard recited as we strolled together through the fields of the Chateauguay Valley , and were kind enough to approve . My hope is , that , considering the stage of advancement of their author , and remembering the circumstances of his writing ( during the intervals of study for a college examination ) , you will approve all the pieces here presented to you by him ; and my further hope is , that you ,— you , sweet in song as firm in friendship ,— may yet have cause to regard him as one</p>

    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="8">Next morning in the Park I took a stroll .</l>
     <l n="9">A walk upon Mount Royal is a thing ,</l>
     <l n="10">Glorious at any time , but most of all</l>
     <l n="11">At early morning in the opening spring ,</l>
     <l n="12">While yet the snow-wreaths to the rock-shelves cling ,</l>
     <l n="13">And little streamlets lash the steaming side ;</l>
     <l n="14">While on the air the April breezes fling</l>
     <l n="15">An appetizing vigor far and wide ,</l>
     <l n="16">And make the steep ascent a pleasure and a pride .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="17">The path ascends by stately Ravenscrag ,</l>
     <l n="18">And past the monument which marks his rest ,</l>
     <l n="19">Over whose history strange traditions drag</l>
     <l n="20">Their spectral robes — his memory 's sole behest .</l>
     <l n="21">Here for a moment halting , all imprest</l>
     <l n="22">With other thoughts than find a ready tongue ,</l>
     <l n="23">I view the leopard slope , the bristling crest ,</l>
     <l n="24">The blue beyond , with cloud veils lightly hung ,</l>
     <l n="25">And glory in a dream of time when earth was young .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="26">I follow by the winding road until ,</l>
     <l n="27">By taking at the sweep the northern arm ,</l>
     <l n="28">I reach the summit . For the topmost hill</l>
     <l n="29">The scenery reserves her chiefest charm ;</l>
     <l n="30">The upper sky is clear and light and warm ;</l>
     <l n="31">The southern peaks that far away I wist ,</l>
     <l n="32">Seem close upon me ; round their lower form</l>
     <l n="33">A shroud is wrapped ; their tops , by sunlight kiss 'd ,</l>
     <l n="34">High in mid-air appear and mighty in the mist .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="35">Beneath , the River spreads his glist'ning sheen ,</l>
     <l n="36">Spanned by not least of master workmanships ,</l>
     <l n="37">Which sits as conscious daughter of a queen .</l>
     <l n="38">And here art thou , my city , and thou dip'st</l>
     <l n="39">Thy towers in the mist , whose magic strips</l>
     <l n="40">My spirit of the pall Time weaves — in vain ;</l>
     <l n="41">Nor Time nor Disappointment can eclipse</l>
     <l n="42">Days of young bliss — they must and will remain :</l>
     <l n="43">Once more a wonder thou , half city of the brain .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="44">Fair art thou , City of St. Lawrence ’ Isle ;</l>
     <l n="45">Fair , City of the Hundred Spires ; the seat</l>
     <l n="46">Of the Western Notre Dame , whose towered pile</l>
     <l n="47">Rivals the first , of many a stately street</l>
     <l n="48">And comely mansion , many a garden sweet ,</l>
     <l n="49">Of Art and Nature , envious to please !—</l>
     <l n="50">Thou of the mountain brow , before whose feet</l>
     <l n="51">The Northern Amazon his tribute fees ,</l>
     <l n="52">Fraught with the waters of five mighty inland seas !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="53">And fair art thou , whilome the Capital —</l>
     <l n="54">Not what thou wert , but yet a gorgeous grave —</l>
     <l n="55">Fortress of fame , upon whose rocky wall</l>
     <l n="56">Records of glory awe the trembling wave ,</l>
     <l n="57">Heights where the memories of heroes pave</l>
     <l n="58">The ancient streets and lustre all the scene !</l>
     <l n="59">Fair , too , thou city where our fasces have</l>
     <l n="60">Their present rest ; none worthier I ween !</l>
     <l n="61">And fair , ay , very fair , thou city called “ Queen ! ”</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">‘ Tis true , in midst of all , there may arise</l>
     <l n="2">For man 's society a sudden thirst ,</l>
     <l n="3">A sense of hopeless vacancy which dries</l>
     <l n="4">The spirit with a loneliness accurst ,</l>
     <l n="5">A longing irresistible to burst</l>
     <l n="6">The branchy brake with other birds to sing ,</l>
     <l n="7">Or , as , from where in solemn shades immerst ,</l>
     <l n="8">The beetle comes to wanton on the wing</l>
     <l n="9">Around my lamplight flame — alas ! poor , foolish thing .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="10">But here thou may'st associate , though alone ,</l>
     <l n="11">With worthiest men , the best of every age ,</l>
     <l n="12">Through whom the universe of thought has grown</l>
     <l n="13">To what it is — the noble , good , and sage .</l>
     <l n="14">How vain the fret , how frivolous the rage</l>
     <l n="15">For social rank , when thus e'en monarchs deign</l>
     <l n="16">In close communion gladly to engage !</l>
     <l n="17">Nay , more than monarchs — Still the Mantuan swain</l>
     <l n="18">His fadeless laurel wears — What crowned Augustus ’ reign ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="19">A thing of gold — ‘ tis crumbled in the dust ,</l>
     <l n="20">The crowns of sovereigns and their sceptres all</l>
     <l n="21">Decay and are forgotten . Who would trust</l>
     <l n="22">His fame to what fleet ruin must inthral ?</l>
     <l n="23">Tombs will obliterate and columns fall ,</l>
     <l n="24">Annals be lost , and nothing have remained</l>
     <l n="25">Of dynasties — The Conqueror of Gaul</l>
     <l n="26">And Lord of the World may yet have only reigned</l>
     <l n="27">By Shakspere 's suff'rance — What hath all the rest attained ?</l>

    <head>IN THE SUGAR BUSH .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">I halted at the margin of the wood ,</l>
     <l n="2">For tortuous was the path , and overhead</l>
     <l n="3">Low branches hung , and roots and fragments rude</l>
     <l n="4">Of rock hindered the tardy foot . I led</l>
     <l n="5">My timid horse , that started at our tread</l>
     <l n="6">And looked about on every side in fear ,</l>
     <l n="7">Until , arising from the jocund shed ,</l>
     <l n="8">The voice of laughter broke upon our ear ,</l>
     <l n="9">And through the chinks the light shone out as we drew near .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="10">I tied the bridle rain about a tree ,</l>
     <l n="11">And on the ample flatness of a stone</l>
     <l n="12">Awhile I lay . ‘ Tis very sweet to be</l>
     <l n="13">In social mirth 's domain , unseen , alone ,</l>
     <l n="14">Sweet to make others ’ happiness one 's own :</l>
     <l n="15">And he who views the dance from still recess ,</l>
     <l n="16">Or reads a love tale in a meadow , prone ,</l>
     <l n="17">Secures the joy without the weariness .</l>
     <l n="18">And fills with love 's delight , nor feels its sore distress .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="19">This mind detained me in the night , but soon</l>
     <l n="20">Far other thoughts usurped my regal soul ,</l>
     <l n="21">With the Supreme made fitter to commune</l>
     <l n="22">When human sympathy illumes the scroll</l>
     <l n="23">And points the secrets of the mighty Whole .</l>
     <l n="24">I 've spurned the earth to roam the Universe ,</l>
     <l n="25">And with the Eternal deadened Time 's control ,</l>
     <l n="26">For refuge from the shadow of a curse ,</l>
     <l n="27">Or lust of curious lore — than maddest motive worse .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="28">And Thou , Great Essence of all things that are ,</l>
     <l n="29">Hast been to me most prodigal of grace ,</l>
     <l n="30">Thou'st smiled on me in many a twinkling star ,</l>
     <l n="31">The morn hath showered kisses on my face ,</l>
     <l n="32">In Nature 's arms , thy bodily embrace ,</l>
     <l n="33">Not purest poet hath more fondled been .</l>
     <l n="34">‘ Tis true that I have often thought to trace ,</l>
     <l n="35">Instead of peace , a harshness in thy mien ,</l>
     <l n="36">And where I beauty sought , discordant sights obscene .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="37">But not with aching heart I sought thee now ,</l>
     <l n="38">That thou might'st numb with thy narcotic night</l>
     <l n="39">The restless pulse , oblivious balm bestow ,</l>
     <l n="40">Infuse this frailty with thy glorious might ,</l>
     <l n="41">And blind with beauty to the mortal blight .</l>
     <l n="42">Not even wilful love possessed me , when ,</l>
     <l n="43">Behold , thy spirit stole upon my sight</l>
     <l n="44">And ravished me — What wonder that my ken</l>
     <l n="45">Forsook this little world of vanity and men ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="46">And howsoe'er it seemed at other times</l>
     <l n="47">To my imperfect and diseased mind ,</l>
     <l n="48">Which darkened with the shadow of men 's crimes</l>
     <l n="49">Thy virtue , fancying in thee to find</l>
     <l n="50">Reflection of the ills that shake mankind ,</l>
     <l n="51">Though on me now a tempest broke and war</l>
     <l n="52">Convulsed the elements , I would perceive behind ,</l>
     <l n="53">Law , harmony , and purpose — That falling star</l>
     <l n="54">Seems sped to be the sun of new-formed worlds afar .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="55">And yet the scene was such as often shares</l>
     <l n="56">The obscurest soul — no wondrous rarity ,—</l>
     <l n="57">The slender maples holding to the stars</l>
     <l n="58">Their outstretched arms , as praying silently —</l>
     <l n="59">A sea of stars — a dancing , dazzling sea ,</l>
     <l n="60">Tremendous , mighty , infinite , supreme ,</l>
     <l n="61">Emblem of Might , Eternity 's decree ,</l>
     <l n="62">Half crediting the mythologic dream</l>
     <l n="63">And making of heaven th ’ abode that vulgar fancies deem .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="64">A common scene , perchance , but , to the mind</l>
     <l n="65">Which Nature hath enlightened with her ray</l>

     <l n="67">Her beauty , to the sparkle and the play</l>
     <l n="68">Of solitary spring , or rare bouquet</l>
     <l n="69">Of tropic flowers ; she hath grandeur more</l>
     <l n="70">Than crowns the mighty peaks of Himalay ,</l>
     <l n="71">Or hurtles in the great Niagara 's roar .</l>
     <l n="72">To me one beam of light can bring a priceless store .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="73">Nay , more ; the mind wherein her fulness dwells</l>
     <l n="74">Can beauty and sublimity instil</l>
     <l n="75">In all created things , till it excels</l>
     <l n="76">Even herself , though nurtured at her rill .</l>
     <l n="77">The mind may be a monarch if it will ,</l>
     <l n="78">And that of which great Nature is the nurse</l>
     <l n="79">May rule itself , subjecting every ill ,</l>
     <l n="80">And be the Sun , all phantoms to disperse ,</l>

     <l n="86">When Good , surviving , sees the Evil hurled</l>
     <l n="87">To final dissolution , and the force</l>
     <l n="88">Of worlds no longer round their centres whirled</l>

     <l n="43">Blindly and recklessly ?— some future day ,</l>
     <l n="44">Mine eye , from thine clearer and stronger grown ,</l>
     <l n="45">May thrid the straggling stars and search the deepening dawn .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="46">O , make my soul an argosy of song ,</l>
     <l n="47">Tranquilly floating on a sea of peace ,</l>
     <l n="48">As with her rowers beautiful and strong</l>
     <l n="49">Some trireme bears among the Isles of Greece</l>
     <l n="50">With music-muffled oars ! Give safe release</l>
     <l n="51">From murky moorings , storms , and rocks that jar ,</l>
     <l n="52">And let its pearls in purity increase ,</l>
     <l n="53">Until with singing sails it cross the bar</l>
     <l n="54">To melt in golden waves with gems of many a star !</l>
