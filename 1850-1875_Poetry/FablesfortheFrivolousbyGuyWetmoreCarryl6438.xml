    <docTitle><titlePart>THE AMBITIOUS FOX AND THE UNAPPROACHABLE GRAPES A farmer built around his crop A wall , and crowned his labors By placing glass upon the top To lacerate his neighbors , Provided they at any time Should feel disposed the wall to climb . He also drove some iron pegs Securely in the coping , To tear the bare , defenceless legs Of brats who , upward groping , Might steal , despite the risk of fall , The grapes that grew upon the wall . One day a fox , on thieving bent , A crafty and an old one , Most shrewdly tracked the pungent scent That eloquently told one That grapes were ripe and grapes were good And likewise in the neighborhood . He threw some stones of divers shapes The luscious fruit to jar off : It made him ill to see the grapes So near and yet so far off . His throws were strong , his aim was fine , But “ Never touched me ! ” said the vine . The farmer shouted , “ Drat the boys ! ” And , mounting on a ladder , He sought the cause of all the noise ; No farmer could be madder , Which was not hard to understand Because the glass had cut his hand . His passion he could not restrain , But shouted out , “ You 're thievish ! ” The fox replied , with fine disdain , “ Come , country , do n't be peevish . ” ( Now “ country ” is an epithet One can n't forgive , nor yet forget . ) The farmer rudely answered back With compliments unvarnished , And downward hurled the bric-a-brac With which the wall was garnished , In view of which demeanor strange , The fox retreated out of range .</titlePart></docTitle>
    <epigraph>
     <p>“ I will not try the grapes to-day , ” He said . “ My appetite is Fastidious , and , anyway , I fear appendicitis . ” ( The fox was one of the elite Who call it site instead of seet . ) The moral is that if your host Throws glass around his entry You know it is n't done by most Who claim to be the gentry , While if he hits you in the head You may be sure he 's underbred .</p>

   <head>THE PERSEVERING TORTOISE</head>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>AND</head>
    <head>THE PRETENTIOUS HARE</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Once a turtle , finding plenty</l>
     <l n="2">In seclusion to bewitch ,</l>
     <l n="3">Lived a dolce far niente</l>
     <l n="4">Kind of life within a ditch ;</l>
     <l n="5">Rivers had no charm for him ,</l>
     <l n="6">As he told his wife and daughter ,</l>
     <l n="7">“ Though my friends are in the swim ,</l>
     <l n="8">Mud is thicker far than water . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">One fine day , as was his habit ,</l>
     <l n="10">He was dozing in the sun ,</l>
     <l n="11">When a young and flippant rabbit</l>
     <l n="12">Happened by the ditch to run :</l>
     <l n="13">“ Come and race me , ” he exclaimed ,</l>
     <l n="14">“ Fat inhabitant of puddles .</l>
     <l n="15">Sluggard ! You should be ashamed .</l>
     <l n="16">Such a life the brain befuddles . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="17">This , of course , was banter merely ,</l>
     <l n="18">But it stirred the torpid blood</l>
     <l n="19">Of the turtle , and severely</l>
     <l n="20">Forth he issued from the mud .</l>
     <l n="21">“ Done ! ” he cried . The race began ,</l>
     <l n="22">But the hare resumed his banter ,</l>
     <l n="23">Seeing how his rival ran</l>
     <l n="24">In a most unlovely canter .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="25">Shouting , “ Terrapin , you 're bested !</l>
     <l n="26">You 'd be wiser , dear old chap ,</l>
     <l n="27">If you sat you down and rested</l>
     <l n="28">When you reach the second lap . ”</l>
     <l n="29">Quoth the turtle , “ I refuse .</l>
     <l n="30">As for you , with all your talking ,</l>
     <l n="31">Sit on any lap you choose .</l>
     <l n="32">I shall simply go on walking . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="33">Now this sporting proposition</l>
     <l n="34">Was , upon its face , absurd ;</l>
     <l n="35">Yet the hare , with expedition ,</l>
     <l n="36">Took the tortoise at his word ,</l>
     <l n="37">Ran until the final lap ,</l>
     <l n="38">Then , supposing he 'd outclassed him ,</l>
     <l n="39">Laid him down and took a nap</l>
     <l n="40">And the patient turtle passed him !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="41">Plodding on , he shortly made the</l>
     <l n="42">Line that marked the victor 's goal ;</l>
     <l n="43">Paused , and found he 'd won , and laid the</l>
     <l n="44">Flattering unction to his soul .</l>
     <l n="45">Then in fashion grandiose ,</l>
     <l n="46">Like an after-dinner speaker ,</l>
     <l n="47">Touched his flipper to his nose ,</l>
     <l n="48">And remarked , “ Ahem ! Eureka ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="49">And THE MORAL ( lest you miss one )</l>
     <l n="50">Is : There 's often time to spare ,</l>
     <l n="51">And that races are ( like this one )</l>
     <l n="52">Won not always by a hair .</l>
    </lg>

   <p>THE PATRICIAN PEACOCKS</p>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>AND</head>
    <head>THE OVERWEENING JAY</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Once a flock of stately peacocks</l>
     <l n="2">Promenaded on a green ,</l>
     <l n="3">There were twenty-two or three cocks ,</l>
     <l n="4">Each as proud as seventeen ,</l>
     <l n="5">And a glance , however hasty ,</l>
     <l n="6">Showed their plumage to be tasty ;</l>
     <l n="7">Wheresoever one was placed , he</l>
     <l n="8">Was a credit to the scene .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">Now their owner had a daughter</l>
     <l n="10">Who , when people came to call ,</l>
     <l n="11">Used to say , “ You 'd reelly oughter</l>
     <l n="12">See them peacocks on the mall . ”</l>
     <l n="13">Now this was n't to her credit ,</l>
     <l n="14">And her callers came to dread it ,</l>
     <l n="15">For the way the lady said it</l>
     <l n="16">Was n't recherche at all .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="17">But a jay that overheard it</l>
     <l n="18">From his perch upon a fir</l>
     <l n="19">Did n't take in how absurd it</l>
     <l n="20">Was to every one but her ;</l>
     <l n="21">When they answered , “ You do n't tell us ! ”</l>
     <l n="22">And to see the birds seemed zealous</l>
     <l n="23">He became extremely jealous ,</l>
     <l n="24">Wishing , too , to make a stir .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="25">As the peacocks fed together</l>
     <l n="26">He would join them at their lunch ,</l>
     <l n="27">Culling here and there a feather</l>
     <l n="28">Till he 'd gathered quite a bunch ;</l>
     <l n="29">Then this bird , of ways perfidious ,</l>
     <l n="30">Stuck them on him most fastidious</l>
     <l n="31">Till he looked uncommon hideous ,</l>
     <l n="32">Like a Judy or a Punch .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="33">But the peacocks , when they saw him ,</l>
     <l n="34">One and all began to haul ,</l>
     <l n="35">And to harry and to claw him</l>
     <l n="36">Till the creature could n't crawl ;</l>
     <l n="37">While their owner 's vulgar daughter ,</l>
     <l n="38">When her startled callers sought her ,</l>
     <l n="39">And to see the struggle brought her ,</l>
     <l n="40">Only said , “ They 're on the maul . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="41">It was really quite revolting</l>
     <l n="42">When the tumult died away ,</l>
     <l n="43">One would think he had been moulting</l>
     <l n="44">So dishevelled was the jay ;</l>
     <l n="45">He was more than merely slighted ,</l>
     <l n="46">He was more than disunited ,</l>
     <l n="47">He 'd been simply dynamited</l>
     <l n="48">In the fervor of the fray .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="49">And THE MORAL of the verses</l>
     <l n="50">Is : That short men can n't be tall .</l>
     <l n="51">Nothing sillier or worse is</l>
     <l n="52">Than a jay upon a mall .</l>
     <l n="53">And the jay opiniative</l>
     <l n="54">Who , because he 's imitative ,</l>
     <l n="55">Thinks he 's highly decorative</l>
     <l n="56">Is the biggest jay of all .</l>

   <p>THE ARROGANT FROG</p>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>AND</head>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Once , on a time and in a place</l>
     <l n="2">Conducive to malaria ,</l>
     <l n="3">There lived a member of the race</l>
     <l n="4">Of Rana Temporaria ;</l>
     <l n="5">Or , more concisely still , a frog</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="7">A bull of Brobdingnagian size ,</l>
     <l n="8">Too proud for condescension ,</l>
     <l n="9">One morning chanced to cast his eyes</l>
     <l n="10">Upon the frog I mention ;</l>
     <l n="11">And , being to the manner born ,</l>
     <l n="12">Surveyed him with a lofty scorn .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="13">Perceiving this , the bactrian 's frame</l>
     <l n="14">With anger was inflated ,</l>

     <l n="16">Egregiously elated ;</l>
     <l n="17">For inspiration 's sudden spell</l>
     <l n="18">Had pointed out a way to swell .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="19">“ Ha ! ha ! ” he proudly cried , “ a fig</l>

     <l n="21">Just watch me while I grow as big</l>

     <l n="23">To which magniloquential gush</l>
     <l n="24">His bullship simply answered “ Tush ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="25">Alas ! the frog 's success was slight ,</l>
     <l n="26">Which really was a wonder ,</l>
     <l n="27">In view of how with main and might</l>
     <l n="28">He strove to grow rotunder !</l>
     <l n="29">And , standing patiently the while ,</l>
     <l n="30">The bull displayed a quiet smile .</l>

     <l n="32">But ah , the frog tried once too oft</l>
     <l n="33">And , doing so , he busted ;</l>
     <l n="34">Whereat the bull discreetly coughed</l>
     <l n="35">And moved away , disgusted ,</l>
     <l n="36">As well he might , considering</l>

    <head>THE DOMINEERING EAGLE</head>
    <head>AND</head>
    <head>THE INVENTIVE BRATLING</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">O'er a small suburban borough</l>
     <l n="2">Once an eagle used to fly ,</l>
     <l n="3">Making observations thorough</l>
     <l n="4">From his station in the sky ,</l>
     <l n="5">And presenting the appearance</l>
     <l n="6">Of an animated V ,</l>
     <l n="7">Like the gulls that lend coherence</l>
     <l n="8">Unto paintings of the sea .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">Looking downward at a church in</l>
     <l n="10">This attractive little shire ,</l>
     <l n="11">He beheld a smallish urchin</l>
     <l n="12">Shooting arrows at the spire ;</l>
     <l n="13">In a spirit of derision ,</l>
     <l n="14">“ Look alive ! ” the eagle said ;</l>
     <l n="15">And , with infinite precision ,</l>
     <l n="16">Dropped a feather on his head .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="17">Then the boy , annoyed distinctly</l>
     <l n="18">By the freedom of the bird ,</l>
     <l n="19">Voiced his anger quite succinctly</l>
     <l n="20">In a single scathing word ;</l>
     <l n="21">And he sat him on a barrow ,</l>
     <l n="22">And he fashioned of this same</l>
     <l n="23">Eagle 's feather such an arrow</l>
     <l n="24">As was worthy of the name .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="25">Then he tried his bow , and , stringing</l>
     <l n="26">It with caution and with care ,</l>
     <l n="27">Sent that arrow singing , winging</l>
     <l n="28">Towards the eagle in the air .</l>
     <l n="29">Straight it went , without an error ,</l>
     <l n="30">And the target , bathed in blood ,</l>
     <l n="31">Lurched , and lunged , and fell to terra</l>
     <l n="32">Firma , landing with a thud .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="33">“ Bird of freedom , ” quoth the urchin ,</l>
     <l n="34">With an unrelenting frown ,</l>

     <l n="36">The menagerie in town ;</l>
     <l n="37">But of feathers quite a cluster</l>
     <l n="38">I shall first remove for Ma :</l>
     <l n="39">Thanks to you , she 'll have a duster</l>
     <l n="40">For her precious objets d'art . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="41">And THE MORAL is that pride is</l>

     <l n="11">That he lifted up the viper</l>
     <l n="12">And bestowed her in his plaid .</l>
     <l n="13">“ Though the Scot is stern , at least he</l>
     <l n="14">No unhappy creature spurns ,</l>
     <l n="15">‘ Sleekit , cowrin , tim'rous beastie , ’ ”</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="17">This was unaffected kindness ,</l>
     <l n="18">But there was , to state the fact ,</l>
     <l n="19">Just a slight soupcon of blindness</l>
     <l n="20">In his charitable act .</l>
     <l n="21">If you 'd watched the piper , shortly</l>
     <l n="22">You 'd have seen him leap aloft ,</l>
     <l n="23">As this snake , of ways uncourtly ,</l>
     <l n="24">Bit him suddenly and oft .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="25">There was really no excuse for</l>
     <l n="26">This , the viper 's cruel work ,</l>
     <l n="27">And the piper found a use for</l>
     <l n="28">Words he 'd never learned at kirk ;</l>
     <l n="29">But the biting was so thorough</l>
     <l n="30">That although the doctors tried ,</l>
     <l n="31">Not the best in Edinburgh</l>
     <l n="32">Could assist him , and he died .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="33">And THE MORAL is : The piper</l>
     <l n="34">Of the matter made a botch ;</l>
     <l n="35">One can hardly blame the viper</l>
     <l n="36">If she took a nip of Scotch ,</l>
     <l n="37">For she only did what he did ,</l>
     <l n="38">And his nippie was n't small ,</l>
     <l n="39">Otherwise , you see , he needed</l>
     <l n="40">Not have seen the snake at all .</l>

     <l n="1">A Boston man an ulster had ,</l>
     <l n="2">An ulster with a cape that fluttered :</l>
     <l n="3">It smacked his face , and made him mad ,</l>
     <l n="4">And polyglot remarks he uttered :</l>
     <l n="5">“ I bought it at a bargain , ” said he ,</l>

     <l n="7">The wind that chanced to blow that day</l>
     <l n="8">Was easterly , and rather strong , too :</l>
     <l n="9">It loved to see the galling way</l>
     <l n="10">That clothes vex those whom they belong to :</l>
     <l n="11">“ Now watch me , ” cried this spell of weather ,</l>
     <l n="12">“ I 'll rid him of it altogether . ”</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="13">It whirled the man across the street ,</l>
     <l n="14">It banged him up against a railing ,</l>
     <l n="15">It twined the ulster round his feet ,</l>
     <l n="16">But all of this was unavailing :</l>
     <l n="17">For not without resource it found him :</l>
     <l n="18">He drew the ulster closer round him .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="19">“ My word ! ” the man was heard to say ,</l>

     <l n="25">The sun , emerging from a rift</l>
     <l n="26">Between the clouds , observed the victim ,</l>
     <l n="27">And how the wind beset and biffed ,</l>
     <l n="28">Belabored , buffeted , and kicked him .</l>
     <l n="29">Said he , “ This wind is doubtless new here :</l>

     <l n="34">The mercury most nimbly spurted .</l>
