    <head>PREFACE</head>
    <p n="1">In this volume I have attempted to give an account of Browning 's life and an estimation of his character : to set forth , with sufficient illustration from his poems , his theory of poetry , his aim and method : to make clear some of the leading ideas in his work : to show his fondness for paradox : to exhibit the nature and basis of his optimism . I have given in complete form over fifty of his poems , each one preceded by my interpretation of its meaning and significance .</p>

   <p>UP AT A VILLA — DOWN IN THE CITY</p>
   <p>WHICH ?</p>
   <p>BROWNING</p>
    <p>I</p>
   <p>THE MAN</p>
   <p>If we enter this world from some other state of existence , it seems certain that in the obscure pre-natal country , the power of free choice — so stormily debated by philosophers and theologians here — does not exist . Millions of earth 's infants are handicapped at the start by having parents who lack health , money , brains , and character ; and in many cases the environment is no better than the ancestry . “ God plants us where we grow , ” said Pompilia , and we can not save the rose by placing it on the tree-top . Robert Browning , who was perhaps the happiest man in the nineteenth century , was particularly fortunate in his advent . Of the entire population of the planet in the year of grace 1812 , he could hardly have selected a better father and mother than were chosen for him ; and the place of his birth was just what it should have been , the biggest town on earth . All his life long he was emphatically a city man , dwelling in London , Florence , Paris , and Venice , never remaining long in rural surroundings .</p>
   <p>Browning was born on May 7 , 1812 , in Southampton Street , Camberwell , London , a suburb on the southern side of the river . One hundred years later , as I traversed the length of this street , it looked squalid in the rain , and is indeed sufficiently unlovely . But in 1812 it was a good residential locality , and not far away were fresh woods and pastures .... The good health of Browning 's father may be inferred from the fact that he lived to be eighty-four , “ without a day 's illness ; ” he was a practical , successful business man , an official in the Bank of England . His love of literature and the arts is proved by the fact that he practised them constantly for the pure joy of the working ; he wrote reams and reams of verse , without publishing a line . He had extraordinary facility in composition , being able to write poetry even faster than his son . Rossetti said that he had “ a real genius for drawing . ” He owned a large and valuable library , filled with curiosities of literature . Robert was brought up among books , even in earliest youth turning over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore . His latest biographers have shown the powerful and permanent effects on his poetry of this early reading .</p>
   <p>Browning 's father — while not a rich man — had sufficient income to give his son every possible advantage in physical and intellectual training , and to enable him to live without earning a cent ; after Robert grew up , he was absolutely free to devote his entire time and energy to writing poetry , which , even to the day of his death , did not yield a livelihood . The young poet was free from care , free from responsibility , and able from childhood to old age to bring out the best that was in him . A curious and exact parallel is found in the case of the great pessimist , Schopenhauer , who never ceased to be grateful to his father for making his whole life-work possible . In his later years , Browning wrote : “ It would have been quite unpardonable in any case not to have done my best . My dear father put me in a condition most favourable for the best work I was capable of . When I think of the many authors who had to fight their way through all sorts of difficulties I have no reason to be proud of my achievements . ”</p>
   <p>Browning 's mother , whom he loved with passionate adoration , was a healthy and sensible woman ; better than all these gifts , she was deeply religious , with sincere and unaffected piety . She was a Dissenter , a Congregationalist , and brought up Robert in the nurture and admonition of the Lord , herself a noble example of her teachings . This evangelical training had an incalculably strong influence on the spirit of Browning 's poetry . She loved music ardently , and when Robert was a boy , used to play the piano to him in the twilight . He always said that he got his devotion to music from her .</p>
   <p>In these days , when there is such a strong reaction everywhere against the elective system in education , it is interesting to remember that Browning 's education was simply the elective system pushed to its last possibility . It is perhaps safe to say that no learned man in modern times ever had so little of school and college . His education depended absolutely and exclusively on his inclinations ; he was encouraged to study anything he wished . His father granted him perfect liberty , never sent him to any “ institution of learning , ” and allowed him to do exactly as he chose , simply providing competent private instruction in whatever subject the youth expressed any interest . Thus he learned Greek , Latin , the modern languages , music ( harmony and counterpoint , as well as piano and organ ) , chemistry ( a private laboratory was fitted up in the house ) , history and art . Now every one knows that ; so far as definite acquisition of knowledge is concerned , our schools and colleges-at least in America — leave much to be desired ; our boys and girls study the classics for years without being able to read a page at sight ; and the modern languages show a similarly meagre harvest . If one wishes positive and practical results one must employ a private tutor , or work alone in secret . The great advantages of our schools and colleges — except in so far as they inspire intellectual curiosity — are not primarily of a scholarly nature ; their strength lies in other directions . The result of Browning 's education was that at the age of twenty he knew more than most college graduates ever know ; and his knowledge was at his full command . His favorite reading on the train , for example , was a Greek play ; one of the reasons why his poetry sometimes seems so pedantic is simply because he never realised how ignorant most of us really are . I suppose he did not believe that men could pass years in school and university training and know so little . Yet the truth is , that most boys , brought up as Browning was , would be utterly unfitted for the active duties and struggles of life , and indeed for the amenities of social intercourse . With ninety-nine out of a hundred , such an education , so far as it made for either happiness or efficiency , would be a failure . But Browning was the hundredth man . He was profoundly learned without pedantry and without conceit ; and he was primarily a social being ,</p>
   <p>His physical training was not neglected . The boy had expert private instruction in fencing , boxing , and riding . He was at ease on the back of a spirited horse . He was particularly fond of dancing , which later aroused the wonder of Elizabeth Barrett , who found it difficult to imagine the author of Paracelsus dancing the polka .</p>
   <p>In 1833 appeared Browning 's first poem , Pauline , which had been completed before he was twenty-one years old . His aunt , Mrs. Silverthorne , gave him one hundred and fifty dollars , which paid the expenses of publication . Not a single copy was sold , and the unbound sheets came home to roost . The commercial worth of Pauline was exactly zero ; today it is said that only five copies exist . One was sold recently for two thousand four hundred dollars .</p>
   <p>In 1834 Browning visited Russia , going by steamer to Rotterdam , and then driving fifteen hundred miles with horses . Although he was in Russia about three months , and at the most sensitive time of life , the country made surprisingly little impression upon him , or at least upon his poetry . The dramatic idyl , Ivan Ivànovitch , is practically the only literary result of this journey . It was the south , and not the north , that was to be the inspiration of Browning .</p>
   <p>He published his second poem , Paracelsus , in 1835 . Although this attracted no general attention , and had no sale , it was enthusiastically reviewed by John Forster , who declared that its author was a man of genius . The most fortunate result of its appearance was that it brought Browning within the pale of literary society , and gave him the friendship of some of the leading men in London . The great actor Macready was charmed with the poem , and young Browning haunted Macready 's dressing-room at the theatre for years ; but their friendship ceased in 1843 when A Blot in the ‘ Scutcheon was acted . Browning wrote four plays for Macready , two of which were accepted .</p>
   <p>Although Browning late in life remarked in a casual conversation that he had visited Italy in 1834 , he must have been mistaken , for it is impossible to find any record of such a journey . To the best of our knowledge , he first saw the land of his inspiration in 1838 , sailing from London on April 13th , passing through the Straits of Gibraltar on the twenty-ninth , and reaching Trieste on May 30th . On the first of June he entered Venice . It was on a walking-trip that he first saw the village of Asolo , about thirty miles to the northeast of Venice . Little did he then realise how closely his name would be forever associated with this tiny town . The scenes of Pippa Passes he located there : the last summer of his life , in 1889 , was spent in Asolo , his last volume he named in memory of the village ; and on the one hundredth anniversary of his birth , the street where he lived and wrote in 1889 was formally named Via Roberto Browning . His son , Robert Barrett Browning , lived to see this event , and died at Asolo on July 8 , 1912 .</p>
   <p>The long and obscure poem Sordello was published in 1840 ; and then for thirty years Browning produced poetry of the highest order : poetry that shows scarcely any obscurity , and that in lyric and dramatic power has given its author a fixed place among the greatest names in English literature .</p>
   <p>The story of the marriage and married life of Elizabeth Barrett and Robert Browning is one of the greatest love stories in the world 's history ; their love-letters reveal a drama of noble passion that excels in beauty and intensity the universally popular examples of Heloise and Abelard , Aucassin and Nicolette , Paul and Virginia . There was a mysterious bond between them long before the personal acquaintance : each admired the other 's poetry . Miss Barrett had a picture of Browning in her sickroom , and declared that the adverse criticism constantly directed against his verse hurt her like a lash across her own back . In a new volume of poems , she made a complimentary reference to his work , and in January , 1845 , he wrote her a letter properly beginning with the two words , “ I love . ” It was her verses that he loved , and said so . In May he saw her and illustrated his own doctrine by falling in love with her at first sight . She was in her fortieth year , and an invalid ; but if any one is surprised at the passion she aroused in the handsome young poet , six years her junior , one has only to read her letters . She was a charming woman , feminine from her soul to her finger-tips , the incarnation of das Ewigweibliche . Her intimate friends were mostly what were then known as strong-minded women — I suppose to-day they would seem like timid , shy violets . She was modest , gentle , winsome , irresistible : profoundly learned , with the eager heart of a child .</p>
   <p>Wimpole Street in London , “ the long , unlovely street , ” as Tennyson calls it , is holy ground to the lover of literature : for at Number 67 lived Arthur Henry Hallam , and diagonally opposite , at Number 50 , lived Elizabeth Barrett . This street — utterly commonplace in appearance — is forever associated with the names of our two great Victorian poets : and the association with Tennyson is Death : with Browning , Love .</p>
   <p>Not only was Elizabeth believed to be a hopeless invalid , but her father had forbidden any of his children to marry . He was a religious man , whose motto in his own household was apparently “ Thou shalt have no other gods before me . ” He had the particular kind of piety that is most offensive to ordinary humanity . He gave his children , for whom he had a stern and savage passion , everything except what they wanted . He had an insane jealousy of any possible lover , and there is no doubt that he would have preferred to attend the funeral of any one of his children rather than a marriage . But Browning 's triumphant love knew no obstacles , and he persuaded Elizabeth Barrett to run away with him . They were married in September , 1846 , and shortly after left for Italy . Her father refused to see either of them in subsequent years , and returned his daughter 's letters unopened . Is there any cause in nature for these hard hearts ?</p>
   <p>Browning 's faith wrought a miracle . Instead of dying on the journey to Italy , Mrs. Browning got well , and the two lived together in unclouded happiness for fifteen years , until 1861 , when she died in his arms . Not a scrap of writing passed between them from the day of her marriage to the day of her death : for they were never separated . She said that all a woman needed to be perfectly happy was three things — Life , Love , Italy — and she had all three .</p>
   <p>The relations between Elizabeth Barrett and Robert Browning had all the wonder and beauty of a mediaeval romance , with the notable addition of being historically true . The familiar story of a damosel imprisoned in a gloomy dungeon , guarded by a cruel dragon — and then , when all her hope had vanished , rescued by the sudden appearance of the brilliant knight , who carried her away from her dull prison to a land of sunshine and happiness — this became the literal experience of Elizabeth Barrett . Her love for her husband was the passionate love of a woman for a man , glorified by adoration for the champion who had miraculously transformed her life from the depths of despair to the topmost heights of joy . He came , “ pouring heaven into this shut house of life . ” She expressed the daily surprise of her happiness in her Sonnets , which one day she put shyly into his hands :</p>

     <l n="1">I thought once how Theocritus had sung</l>
     <l n="2">Of the sweet years , the dear and wished-for years ,</l>
     <l n="3">Who each one in a gracious hand appears</l>
     <l n="4">To bear a gift for mortals , old or young :</l>
     <l n="5">And , as I mused it in his antique tongue ,</l>
     <l n="6">I saw , in gradual vision through my tears ,</l>
     <l n="7">The sweet , sad years , the melancholy years ,</l>
     <l n="8">Those of my own life , who by turns had flung</l>
     <l n="9">A shadow across me . Straightway I was ‘ ware ,</l>
     <l n="10">So weeping , how a mystic Shape did move</l>
     <l n="11">Behind me , and drew me backward by the hair ;</l>
     <l n="12">And a voice said in mastery while I strove , ...</l>
     <l n="13">“ Guess now who holds thee ? ” — “ Death ! ” I said . But , there ,</l>
     <l n="14">The silver answer rang ... “ Not Death , but Love . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="15">My own Beloved , who hast lifted me</l>
     <l n="16">From this drear flat of earth where I was thrown ,</l>

     <l n="18">A life-breath , till the forehead hopefully</l>
     <l n="19">Shines out again , as all the angels see ,</l>
     <l n="20">Before thy saving kiss ! My own , my own ,</l>
     <l n="21">Who camest to me when the world was gone ,</l>
     <l n="22">And I who looked for only God , found thee !</l>
     <l n="23">I find thee : I am safe , and strong , and glad .</l>
     <l n="24">As one who stands in dewless asphodel</l>

     <l n="28">That Love , as strong as Death , retrieves as well .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Browning replied to this wonderful tribute by appending to the fifty poems published in 1855 his One Word More . He wrote this in a metre different from any he had ever used , for he meant the poem to be unique in his works , a personal expression of his love . He remarked that Rafael wrote sonnets , that Dante painted a picture , each man going outside the sphere of his genius to please the woman he loved , to give her something entirely apart from his gifts to the world . He wished that he could do something other than poetry for his wife , and in the next life he believed that it would be possible . But here God had given him only one gift — verse : he must therefore present her with a specimen of the only art he could command ; but it should be utterly unlike all his other poems , for they were dramatic ; here just once , and for one woman only , he would step out from behind the scenes , and address her directly in his own person .</p>
   <p>Of course Browning could have modelled a statue , or written a piece of music for Elizabeth , for in both of these arts he had attained moderate proficiency : but he wished not only to make a gift just for her , but to give it to her in public , with the whole world regarding ; therefore it must be of his best .</p>
   <p>He calls her his moon of poets . He reminds her how a few days ago , they had seen the crescent moon in Florence , how they had seen it nightly waxing until it lamped the facade of San Miniato , while the nightingales , in ecstasy among the cypress trees , gave full-throated applause . Then they had travelled together to London , and now saw the same dispirited moon , saving up her silver parsimoniously , sink in gibbous meanness behind the chimney-tops .</p>
   <p>The notable thing about the moon is that whereas the earth , during one revolution about the sun , turns on its own axis three hundred and sixty-five times , the shy moon takes exactly the same length of time to turn around as she takes to circle once around the earth . For this reason , earth 's inhabitants have never seen but one side of the moon , and never will . Elizabeth Browning is his moon , because she shows the other side to him alone . The radiant splendor of her poetry fills the whole earth with light ; but to her husband she shows the other side , the loving , domestic woman , the unspeakably precious and intimate associate of his daily life . The world thinks it knows her ; but it has seen only one side ; it knows nothing of the marvellous depth and purity of her real nature .</p>

   <p>The Brownings travelled a good deal : they visited many places in Italy , Venice , Ancona , Fano , Siena , and spent several winters in Rome . The winter of 1851-52 was passed at Paris , where on the third of January Browning wrote one of his most notable poems , Childe Roland to the Dark Tower Came . One memorable evening at London in 1855 there were gathered together in an upper room Mr. and Mrs. Browning , Mr. and Mrs. Tennyson , Dante and William Rossetti . Tennyson had just published Maud and Browning the two volumes called Men and Women . Each poet was invited to read from his new work . Tennyson , with one leg curled under him on the sofa , chanted Maud , the tears running down his cheeks ; and then Browning read in a conversational manner his characteristic poem , Fra Lippo Lippi . Rossetti made a pen-and-ink sketch of the Laureate while he was intoning . On one of the journeys made by the Brownings from London to Paris they were accompanied by Thomas Carlyle , who wrote a vivid and charming account of the transit . The poet was the practical member of the party : the “ brave Browning ” struggled with the baggage , and the customs , and the train arrangements ; while the Scot philosopher smoked infinite tobacco .</p>
   <p>The best account of the domestic life of the Brownings at Casa Guidi in Florence was written by Nathaniel Hawthorne , and published in his Italian Note-Books . On a June evening , Mr. and Mrs. Browning , William Cullen Bryant , and Nathaniel Hawthorne ate strawberries and talked spiritualism . Hawthorne and Browning stood on the little balcony overlooking the street , and heard the priests chanting in the church of San Felice , the chant heard only in June , which Browning was to hear again on the night of the June day when he found the old yellow book . Both chant and terrace were to be immortalised in Browning 's epic . Hawthorne said that Browning had an elfin wife and an elf child . “ I wonder whether he will ever grow up , whether it is desirable that he should . ” Like all visitors at Casa Guidi , the American was impressed by the extraordinary sweetness , gentleness , and charity of Elizabeth Browning , and by the energy , vivacity , and conversational powers of her husband . Hawthorne said he seemed to be in all parts of the room at once .</p>
   <p>Mr. Barrett Browning told me in 1904 that he remembered his mother , Elizabeth Barrett Browning , as clearly as though he had seen her yesterday . He was eleven years old at the time of her death . He would have it that her ill health had been greatly exaggerated . She was an invalid , but did not give the impression of being one . She was able to do many things , and had considerable power of endurance . One day in Florence she walked from her home out through the Porta Romana , clear up on the heights , and back to Casa Guidi . “ That was pretty good , was n't it ? ” said he . She was of course the idol of the household , and everything revolved about her . She was “ intensely loved ” by all her friends . Her father was a “ very peculiar man . ” The son 's account of her health differs radically from that written by the mother of E. C. Stedman , who said that Mrs. Browning was kept alive only by opium , which she had to take daily . This writer added , however , that in spite of Mrs. Browning 's wretched health , she had never heard her speak ill of any one , though she talked with her many times .</p>
   <p>After the death of his wife , Browning never saw Florence again . He lived in London , and after a few years was constantly seen in society , Tennyson , who hated society , said that Browning would die in a dress suit . His real fame did not begin until the year 1864 , with the publication of Dramatis Personæ . During the first thirty years of his career , from the publication of Pauline in 1833 to the appearance of Dramatis Personæ , he received always tribute from the few , and neglect , seasoned with ridicule , from the many . Pauline , Paracelsus , Pippa Passes , A Blot in the ‘ Scutcheon , Christmas-Eve , Men and Women — each of these volumes was greeted enthusiastically by men and women whose own literary fame is permanent . But the world knew him not . How utterly obscure he was may be seen by the fact that so late as 1860 , when the publisher 's statement came in for Men and Women , it appeared that during the preceding six months not a single copy had been sold ! The best was yet to be . The Dramatis Personæ was the first of his books to go into a genuine second edition . Then four years later came The Ring and the Book , which a contemporary review pronounced to be the “ most precious and profound spiritual treasure which England has received since the days of Shakespeare . ”</p>
   <p>Fame , which had shunned him for thirty years , came to him in extraordinary measure during the last part of his life : another exact parallel between him and the great pessimist Schopenhauer . It was naturally sweet , its sweetness lessened only by the thought that his wife had not lived to see it . Each had always believed in the superiority of the other : and the only cloud in Mrs. Browning 's mind was the ( to her ) incomprehensible neglect of her husband by the public . At the time of the marriage , it was commonly said that a young literary man had eloped with a great poetess : during their married life , her books went invariably into many editions , while his did not sell at all . And even to the last day of Browning 's earthly existence , her poems far outsold his , to his unspeakable delight . “ The demand for my poems is nothing like so large , ” he wrote cheerfully , in correcting a contrary opinion that had been printed . Even so late as 1885 , I found this passage in an account of Mrs. Browning 's life , published that year , It appears that “ she was married in 1846 to Robert Browning , who was also a poet and dramatic writer of some note , though his fame seems to have been almost totally eclipsed by the superior endowments of his gifted wife . ” This reminds us of the time when Mr. and Mrs. Schumann were presented to a Scandinavian King : Mrs. Schumann played on the piano , and His Majesty , turning graciously to the silent husband , enquired “ Are you also musical ? ”</p>
   <p>The last summer of Browning 's life , the summer of 1889 , was passed at Asolo : in the autumn he moved into his beautiful house in Venice , the Palazzo Rezzonico , which had the finest situation of all Venetian residences , built at an angle in the Grand Canal . Although seventy-seven years old , he was apparently as vigorous as ever : no change had taken place in his appearance , manner or habits . One day he caught a bad cold walking on the Lido in a bitter wind ; and with his usual vehement energy declined to take any proper care of his throat . Instead of staying in , he set out for long tramps with friends , constantly talking in the raw autumn air . In order to prove to his son that nothing was the matter with him , he ran rapidly up three flights of stairs , the son vainly trying to restrain him . Nothing is more characteristic of the youthful folly of aged folk than their impatient resentment of proffered hygienic advice . When we are children , we reject with scorn the suggestions of our parents ; when we are old , we reject with equal scorn the advice of our children . Man is apparently an animal more fit to give advice than to take it . Browning 's impulsive rashness proved fatal . Bronchitis with heart trouble finally sent him to bed , though on the last afternoon of his life he rose and walked about the room . During the last few days he told many good stories and talked with his accustomed eagerness . He died at ten o'clock in the evening of the twelfth of December , 1889 , A few moments before his death came a cablegram from London announcing that his last volume of poems had been published that day , and that the evening papers were speaking in high terms of its contents . “ That is very gratifying , ” said he .</p>
   <p>Browning 's life was healthy , comfortable , and happy . With the exception of frequent headaches in his earlier years , he never knew sickness or physical distress . His son said that he had never seen him in bed in the daytime until the last illness . He had a truly wonderful digestion ; it was his firm belief that one should eat only what one really enjoyed , desire being the infallible sign that the food was healthful . “ My father was a man of bonne fourchette ” said Barrett Browning to me ; “ he was not very fond of meat , but liked all kinds of Italian dishes , especially with rich sauces . He always ate freely of rich and delicate things . He could make a whole meal off mayonnaise . ” It is pleasant to remember that Emerson , the other great optimist of the century , used to eat pie for breakfast . Unlike Carlyle and Tennyson , who smoked constantly , Browning never used tobacco ; he drank wine with his meals , but sparingly , and never more than one kind of wine at a dinner . While physically robust , fond of riding and walking , never using a cab or public conveyance if he could help it , he was like most first-class literary men in caring nothing whatever for competitive sports . He did not learn to swim until late in life ; his son taught him at Pornic , in Brittany . He was venturesome for a man well on in years , swimming far out with boyish delight , as he has himself described it in the Prologue to Fifine at the Fair .</p>
   <p>Browning 's eyes were peculiar , one having a long focus , the other very short . He had the unusual accomplishment ( try it and prove ) of closing either eye without “ squinching , ” and without any apparent effort , though sometimes on the street in strong sunshine his face would be a bit distorted . He did all his reading and writing with one eye , closing the long one as he sat down at his desk . He never wore glasses , and was proud of his microscopic eye . He often wrote minutely , to show off his powers . When he left the house to go for a walk , he shut the short eye and opened the long one , with which he could see an immense distance . He never suffered with any pain in his eyes except once , when a boy , he was trying to be a vegetarian in imitation of his youthful idol , Shelley .</p>
   <p>Contrary to the oft-repeated statement , Browning was not a really fine pianist . As a very young man , he used to play several instruments , and once he had been able to play all of Beethoven 's sonatas on the piano . In later life he became ambitious to improve his skill with this instrument , and had much trouble , for his fingers were clumsy and stiff . He therefore used to rise at six , and practise finger-exercises for an hour !</p>
   <p>He loved first-class music ardently , had a profound knowledge of it , and was a good judge . If the performance was fine , he would express his praise with the utmost enthusiasm ; but bad work caused him acute pain . Sometimes at a concert he would put his fingers in his ears , his suffering being apparently uncontrollable .</p>
   <p>The salient feature of his character was his boyish vivacity and enthusiasm . If he looked out of the window and saw a friend coming along the street to call , he would often rush out and embrace him . In conversation he was extraordinarily eager and impulsive , with a great flow of talk on an enormous range of subjects . If he liked anything , he spoke of it in the heartiest manner , laughing aloud with delight . He was very generous in his appreciation and praise of other men 's work , being beautifully free from that jealousy which is one of the besetting sins of artists . He always tried to see what was good . Occasionally he was enraged at reading a particularly hostile criticism of himself , but on the whole he stood abuse very well , and had abundant opportunity to exercise the gift of patience . A great admirer of Tennyson 's poetry and of Tennyson 's character — they were dear and intimate friends — he never liked the stock comparison . “ Tennyson and I are totally unlike , ” he used to say . No letter from one rival to another was ever more beautiful than the letter Browning wrote to Tennyson on the occasion of the Laureate 's eightieth birthday :</p>
   <p>“ My DEAR TENNYSON — To-morrow is your birthday — indeed , a memorable one . Let me say I associate myself with the universal pride of our country in your glory , and in its hope that for many and many a year we may have your very self among us — secure that your poetry will be a wonder and delight to all those appointed to come after . And for my own part , let me further say , I have loved you dearly . May God bless you and yours .</p>
   <p>“ At no moment from first to last of my acquaintance with your works , or friendship with yourself , have I had any other feeling , expressed or kept silent , than this which an opportunity allows me to utter — that I am and ever shall be , my dear Tennyson , admiringly and affectionately yours ,</p>
   <p>“ ROBERT BROWNING . ”</p>
   <p>What I have said of Browning 's impulsiveness is borne out not only by the universal testimony of those who knew him well , but particularly by a letter of Mrs. Browning to Mrs. Jameson . The manuscript of this letter was bought in London by an American , and went down with the Titanic in 1912 . An extract from it appeared in a bookseller 's catalogue — “ You must learn Robert — he is made of moods — chequered like a chess-board ; and the colour goes for too much — till you learn to treat it as a game . ”</p>
   <p>No man — little or great — was ever more free from pose . His appearance , in clothes and in hair , was studiously normal . No one in his later years would ever have guessed that he was a poet , either in seeing him on the street , or in meeting him at dinner . He was interested in multitudinous things , but never spoke of poetry — either in general or in his own particular — if he could avoid doing so . The fact that strangers who were presented to him and talked with him did not guess that he was the Mr. Browning , gave rise to numberless humorous situations .</p>
   <p>Perhaps the best thing that can be said of his personal character is the truthful statement that he stood in the finest manner two searching tests of manhood — long neglect and sudden popularity , The long years of oblivion , during which he was producing much of his best work , made him neither angry nor sour , though he must have suffered deeply . On the other hand , when his fame reached prodigious proportions , he was neither conceited nor affected . He thoroughly believed in himself , and in his work ; and he cared more about it than he did for its reception .</p>
   <p>The crushing grief that came to him in the death of his wife he bore with that Christian resignation of which we hear more often than perhaps we see in experience . For Browning was a Christian , not only in faith but in conduct ; it was the mainspring of his art and of his life . There are so many writers whose lives show so painful a contrast with the ideal tone of their written work , that it is refreshing and inspiring to be so certain of Browning ; to know that the author of the poems which thrill us was as great in character as he was in genius .</p>
   <p>II</p>
   <p>BROWNING 'S THEORY OF POETRY</p>
   <p>With one exception , the economic law of supply and demand governs the production of literature exactly as it determines the price of wheat . For many years the Novel has been the chief channel of literary expression , the dominant literary form : in the days of Queen Elizabeth , the Drama was supreme . During the early part of the eighteenth century , theological poetry enjoyed a great vogue ; Pope 's Essay on Man circulated with the rapidity of a modern detective story . Consider the history of the English sonnet . This form of verse was exceedingly popular in 1600 , By 1660 it had vanished , and remained obsolete for nearly a hundred years ; about the middle of the eighteenth century it was revived by Thomas Edwards and others ; in the nineteenth century it became fashionable , and still holds its place , as one may see by opening current magazines . Why is it that writers put their ideas on God , Nature , and Woman in the form of a drama in 1600 , and in the form of a novel in 1900 ? Why is it that an inspired man should make poems of exactly fourteen lines in 1580 and in 1880 , and not do it in 1680 ? If we do not attempt an ultimate metaphysical analysis , the answer is clear . The bookseller supplies the public , the publisher supplies the bookseller , the author supplies the publisher . A bookseller has in his window what the people want , and the publisher furnishes material in response to the same desire ; just as a farmer plants in his fields some foodstuffs for which there is a sharp demand . Authors are compelled to write for the market , whether they like it or not , otherwise their work can not appear in print . The reason why the modern novel , with all its shortcomings , is the mirror of ideas on every conceivable topic in religious , educational , economic , and sociological thought , is because the vast majority of writers are at this moment compelled by the market to put their reflections into the form of novels , just as Marlowe and Chapman were forced to write plays . With one exception , the law of supply and demand determines the metrical shape of the poet 's frenzy , and the prose mould of the philosopher 's ideas .</p>
   <p>The exception is so rare that it establishes the rule . The exception is Genius — next to radium the scarcest article on earth . And even Genius often follows the market — it takes the prevailing literary fashion , and adapts itself to the form in vogue in a more excellent way . Such genius — the Genius for Adaptation — never has to wait long for recognition , simply because it supplies a keen popular demand . Such a genius was Shakespeare : such a genius was Pope : such a genius was Scott : such a genius was Byron : such a genius was Tennyson . But the true exception to the great economic law is seen in the Man of Original Genius , who cares not at all for the fashion except perhaps to destroy it . This man is outside the law of supply and demand , because he supplies no demand , and there exists no demand for him . He therefore has to create the demand as well as the supply . Such a man in Music was Wagner : such a man in Drama was Ibsen : such a man in Poetry was Browning .</p>
   <p>These three men were fortunate in all reaching the age of seventy , for had they died midway in their careers , even after accomplishing much of their best work , they would have died in obscurity . They had to wait long for recognition , because nobody was looking for them , nobody wanted them . There was no demand for Wagner 's music — but there is now , and he made it . There was no demand for plays like those of Ibsen ; and there was not the slightest demand for poetry like Pauline and the Dramatic Lyrics . The reason why the public does not immediately recognise the greatness of a work of original genius , is because the public at first — if it notices the thing at all — apprehends not its greatness , but its strangeness . It is so unlike the thing the public is seeking , that it seems grotesque or absurd — many indeed declare that it is exactly the opposite of what it professes to be . Thus , many insisted that Ibsen 's so-called dramas were not really plays : they were merely conversations on serious and unpleasant themes . In like manner , the critics said that Wagner , whatever he composed , did not compose music ; for instead of making melodies , he made harsh and discordant sounds . For eighty years , many men of learning and culture have been loudly proclaiming that Browning , whatever he was , was not a poet ; he was ingenious , he was thoughtful , a philosopher , if you like , but surely no poet . When The Ring and the Book was published , a thoroughly respectable British critic wrote , “ Music does not exist for him any more than for the deaf . ” On the other hand , the accomplished poet , musician , and critic , Sidney Lanier , remarked :</p>
   <p>“ Have you seen Browning 's The Ring and the Book ? I am confident that at the birth of this man , among all the good fairies who showered him with magnificent endowments , one bad one — as in the old tale — crept in by stealth and gave him a constitutional twist i ’ the neck , whereby his windpipe became , and has ever since remained , a marvellous tortuous passage . Out of this glottis-labyrinth his words wo n't , and can n't , come straight . A hitch and a sharp crook in every sentence bring you up with a shock . But what a shock it is ! Did you ever see a picture of a lasso , in the act of being flung ? In a thousand coils and turns , inextricably crooked and involved and whirled , yet , if you mark the noose at the end , you see that it is directly in front of the bison 's head , there , and is bound to catch him ! That is the way Robert Browning catches you . The first sixty or seventy pages of The Ring and the Book are altogether the most doleful reading , in point either of idea or of music , in the English language ; and yet the monologue of Giuseppe Caponsacchi , that of Pompilia Comparini , and the two of Guido Franceschini , are unapproachable , in their kind , by any living or dead poet , me judice . Here Browning 's jerkiness comes in with inevitable effect . You get lightning glimpses — and , as one naturally expects from lightning , zigzag glimpses — into the intense night of the passion of these souls . It is entirely wonderful and without precedent . ”<span corresp="#note1" type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span></p>
   <p>One of the most admirable things about Browning 's admirable career as poet and man is that he wrote not to please the critics , as Tennyson often did , not to please the crowd , as the vast horde of ephemeral writers do , but to please himself . The critics and the crowd professed that they could not understand him ; but he had no difficulty in understanding them . He knew exactly what they wanted , and declined to supply it . Instead of giving them what he thought they wanted , he gave them what he thought they needed . That illustrates the difference between the literary caterer and the literary master . Some poets , critics , dramatists , and novelists are born to be followers of the public taste ; they have their reward . Only a few , and one at a time , are leaders . This is entirely as it should be , for , with followers , the more the merrier ; with leaders it is quite otherwise .</p>
   <p>In the case of a man of original genius , the first evidence of approaching fame is seen in the dust raised by contempt , scorn , ridicule , and various forms of angry resistance from those who will ultimately be converts . People resist him as they resist the Gospel . He comes unto his own , and his own receive him not . The so-called reading public have the stupid cruelty of schoolboys , who will not tolerate on the part of any newcomer the slightest divergence in dress , manners , or conversation from the established standard . Conformity is king ; for schoolboys are the most conservative mass of inertia that can be found anywhere on earth . And they are thorough masters of ridicule — the most powerful weapon known to humanity . But as in schoolboy circles the ostracising laughter is sometimes a sign that a really original boy has made his appearance , so the unthinking opposition of the conventional army of readers is occasionally a proof that the new man has made a powerful impression which can not be shaken off .</p>
   <note xml:id="note1" place="bottom" n="1">Life of Sidney Lanier , by Professor Edwin Mims .</note>
   <p>This is what Browning did with his “ lasso ” style . It was suitably adapted to his purposes , and the public behaved somewhat like the buffalo . They writhed , kicked , struggled , plunged , and the greater the uproar , the more evident it was that they were caught . Shortly before his death , Professor F. J. Child , a scholar of international fame , told me angrily that Wagner was no musician at all ; that he was a colossal fraud ; that the growing enthusiasm for him was mere affectation , which would soon pass away . He spoke with extraordinary passion . I wondered at his rage , but I understand it now . It was the rage of a king against the incoming and inexorable tide .</p>
   <p>Nothing is more singular to contemplate than the variations in form of what the public calls melody , both in notation and in language . What delights the ears of one generation distresses or wearies the ears of another . Elizabethan audiences listened with rapture to long harangues in bombastic blank verse : a modern audience can not endure this . The senses of Queen Anne Englishmen were charmed by what they called the melody of Pope 's verse — by its even regularity and steady flow . To us Pope 's verse is full of wit and cerebration , but we find the measure intolerably monotonous . Indeed , by a curious irony of fate , Pope , who regarded himself as a supreme poet , has since frequently been declared to be no poet at all . Keats wrote Endymion in the heroic couplet — the very measure employed by Pope . But his use of it was so different that this poem would have seemed utterly lacking in melody to Augustan ears — Pope would have attempted to “ versify ” it . And yet we enjoy it . It seems ridiculous to say that the man who wrote Der fliegende Holländer and Tannhäuser could not write melody , and yet it was almost universally said . It seems strange that critics should have declared that the man who wrote Love Among the Ruins could not write rhythmical verse , yet such was once almost the general opinion . Still , the rebellious instinct of the public that condemned Wagner in music and Browning in poetry was founded on something genuine ; for Wagner was unlike other musicians , and Browning was unlike other poets .</p>
   <p>Fraser 's Magazine , for December , 1833 , contained a review of Browning 's first poem , Pauline , which had been published that year . The critic decided that the new poet was mad : “ you being , beyond all question , as mad as Cassandra , without any of the power to prophesy like her , or to construct a connected sentence like anybody else . We have already had a Monomaniac ; and we designate you ‘ The Mad Poet of the Batch ; ’ as being mad not in one direction only , but in all . A little lunacy , like a little knowledge , would be a dangerous thing . ”</p>
   <p>Yet it was in this despised and rejected poem that a great , original genius in English poetry was first revealed . It is impossible to understand Browning or even to read him intelligently without firmly fixing in the mind his theory of poetry , and comprehending fully his ideal and his aim . All this he set forth clearly in Pauline , and though he was only twenty years old when he wrote it , he never wavered from his primary purpose as expressed in two lines of the poem , two lines that should never be forgotten by those who really wish to enjoy the study of Browning :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">And then thou said'st a perfect bard was one</l>
     <l n="2">Who chronicled the stages of all life .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>What is most remarkable about this definition of poetry is what it omits . The average man regards poetry as being primarily concerned with the creation of beauty . Not a word is said about beauty in Browning 's theory . The average man regards poetry as being necessarily melodious , rhythmical , tuneful , above all , pleasing to the senses ; but Browning makes no allusion here to rime or rhythm , nor to melody or music of any sort . To him the bard is a Reporter of Life , an accurate Historian of the Soul , one who observes human nature in its various manifestations , and gives a faithful record . Sound , rhythm , beauty are important , because they are a part of life ; and they are to be found in Browning 's works like wild flowers in a field ; but they are not in themselves the main things . The main thing is human life in its totality . Exactly in proportion to the poet 's power of portraying life , is the poet great ; if he correctly describes a wide range of life , he is greater than if he has succeeded only in a narrow stretch ; and the Perfect Bard would be the one who had chronicled the stages of all life . Shakespeare is the supreme poet because he has approached nearer to this ideal than any one else — he has actually chronicled most phases of humanity , and has truthfully painted a wide variety of character . Browning therefore says of him in Christmas-Eve —</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">As I declare our Poet , him</l>
     <l n="2">Whose insight makes all others dim :</l>
     <l n="3">A thousand poets pried at life ,</l>
     <l n="4">And only one amid the strife</l>
     <l n="5">Rose to be Shakespeare .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Browning 's poetry , as he elsewhere expresses it , was always dramatic in principle , always an attempt to interpret human life . With that large number of highly respectable and useful persons who do not care whether they understand him or not , I have here no concern : but to those who really wish to learn his secret , I insist that his main intention must ever be kept in mind . Much of his so-called obscurity , harshness , and uncouthness falls immediately into its proper place , is indeed necessary . The proof of his true greatness not as a philosopher , thinker , psychologist , but as a poet , lies in the simple fact that when the subject-matter he handles is beautiful or sublime , his style is usually adequate to the situation . Browning had no difficulty in writing melodiously when he placed the posy in the Ring ,</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">O lyric Love , half angel and half bird</l>
     <l n="2">And all a wonder and a wild desire ,</l>
   </lg>
   <p>although just a moment before , when he was joking about his lack of readers , he was anything but musical . The Ring and the Book is full of exquisite beauty , amazing felicity of expression , fluent rhythm and melody ; full also of crudities , jolts , harshness , pedantry , wretched witticisms , and coarseness . Why these contrasts ? Because it is a study of human testimony . The lawyers in this work speak no radiant or spiritual poetry ; they talk like tiresome , conceited pedants because they were tiresome , conceited pedants ; Pompilia 's dying speech of adoring passion for Caponsacchi is sublime music , because she was a spiritual woman in a glow of exaltation . Guido speaks at first with calm , smiling irony , and later rages like a wild beast caught in a spring-trap ; in both cases the verse fits his mood . If Pompilia 's tribute to Caponsacchi had been expressed in language as dull and flat as the pleas of the lawyers , then we should be quite sure that Browning , whatever he was , was no poet . For it would indicate that he could not create the right diction for the right situation and character . Now , his picture of the triple light of sunset in The Last Ride Together is almost intolerably beautiful , because such a scene fairly overwhelms the senses . I hear the common and unintelligent comment , “ Ah , if he had only always written like that ! ” He would have done so , if he had been interested in only the beautiful aspects of this world . “ How could the man who wrote such lovely music as that have also written such harsh stuff as Mr. Sludge , the Medium ” ? The answer is that in the former he was chronicling a stage of life that in its very essence was beauty : in the latter , something exactly the opposite . Life has its trivialities and its ugliness , as well as its sublime aspirations . In Browning 's poetry , whenever the thought rises , the style automatically rises with it ,</p>

     <l n="1">Compare the diction of Holy Cross Day with that in Love Among the</l>
     <l n="2">Ruins . Cleon is an old Greek poet , and he speaks noble , serene verse :</l>

     <l n="4">a joint debate , and he has the appropriate manner and language .</l>

   <p>Browning was a great artist , and the grotesque is an organic part of his structures . To find fault with the grotesque excrescences in Browning 's poetry is exactly like condemning a cathedral because it has gargoyles . How could the architect that dreamed those wonderful columns and arches have made those hideous gargoyles ? Did he flatter himself they were beautiful ? When Macbeth was translated into German , the translator was aghast at the coarse language of the drunken porter . How could the great Shakespeare , who had proved so often his capacity as an artist , have made such an appalling blunder ? So the translator struck out the offensive words , and made the porter sing a sweet hymn to the dawn .</p>
   <p>The theory of poetry originally stated in Pauline Browning not only endeavored to exemplify in his work ; he often distinctly repeated it . In The Glove , all the courtiers , hide-bound by conventional ideas , unite in derisive insults howled at the lady . She goes out ‘ mid hooting and laughter . Only two men follow her : one , because he loves her ; the other , for purely professional reasons . To-day , he would of course be a society reporter . “ I beg your pardon , Madam , but would you kindly grant me an interview ? I represent the New York Flash , and we shall be glad to present your side of this story in our next Sunday issue . ” With equal professional zeal , Peter Ronsard is keenly interested in discovering the motives that underlay the lady 's action . He simply must know , and in defense of his importunity , he presents his credentials . He is a poet , and therefore the strange scene that has just been enacted comes within his special domain .</p>

   <p>In Transcendentalism , a poem which is commonly misunderstood , Browning informs us that the true poet must deal , not with abstract thought , but with concrete things . A young poet informs an elder colleague that he has just launched a huge philosophical poem , called Transcendentalism : a Poem in Twelve Books . His wiser critic tells him that he is on the wrong track altogether ; what he has written is prose , not poetry . Poetry is not a discussion of abstract ideas , but the creation of individual things . Transcendentalism is not a fit subject for poetry , because it deals with metaphysical thought , instead of discussing men and women . To illustrate his point , he makes a comparison between botany and roses . Which is the more interesting , to read a heavy treatise on botany , or to behold roses ? A few pedants may like botany better , but ordinary humanity is quite right in preferring flowers . Browning indicates that the poet should not compose abstract treatises , but should create individual works of art , like the stout Mage of Halberstadt ,</p>

     <l n="4">Over us , under , round us every side ,</l>
     <l n="5">Nay , in and out the tables and the chairs</l>
     <l n="6">And musty volumes , Boehme 's book and all ,—</l>

   <p>Many have failed to understand this poem , because they think that Browning himself is constantly guilty of the sin specifically condemned here . Browning has indeed often been called a thinker , a philosopher : but a moment 's serious reflection will prove that of all English poetry outside of the drama , Browning 's is the least abstract and the most concrete . Poetry is not condemned because it arouses thought , but only when it is abstract in method . Browning often deals with profound ideas , but always by concrete illustrations . For example , he discusses the doctrine of predestination by giving us the individual figure of Johannes-Agricola in meditation : the royalist point of view in the seventeenth century by cavaliers singing three songs : the damnation of indecision by two Laodicaean lovers in The Statue and the Bust . When Browning is interested in any doctrine , idea , or system of thought , he creates a person to illustrate it .</p>
   <p>Browning 's theory of poetry is further reenforced by his poem How It Strikes a Contemporary , which , in the final rearrangement of his works , he placed directly after Transcendentalism , as though to drive his doctrine home . Here is a picture of a real poet . Where does he live , whence does he get his sources of inspiration , and how does he pass his time ? The poem answers these questions in a most instructive manner , if only we keep in mind the original definition given in Pauline . It is conventionally believed that the country is more poetic than the city : that an ideal residence for a poet would be in lonely , lovely , romantic scenery ; and that in splendid solitude and isolation he should clothe his thoughts in forms of beauty . Now Browning 's own life and methods of work were in exact contrast to these popular ideas ; because his theory of poetry requires the poet to live in the very midst of human activities , and to draw his inspiration not from a mountain or the stars , but from all sorts and conditions of men . Thus , in the poem , How It Strikes a Contemporary , the poet lives in a noisy city , spends his time walking the streets , and instead of being lost in a trance , he is intensely aware of everything that happens in the town . The poet is an observer , not a dreamer . Indeed , the citizens think this old poet is a royal spy , because he notices people and events with such sharp attention . Browning would seem to say that the mistake is a quite natural one ; the poet ought to act like a spy , for , if he be a true poet , he is a spy — a spy on human life . He takes upon himself the mystery of things , as if he were God 's spy .</p>

     <l n="1">He walked and tapped the pavement with his cane ,</l>
     <l n="2">Scenting the world , looking it full in face ....</l>
     <l n="3">He glanced o'er books on stalls with half an eye ,</l>
     <l n="4">And fly-leaf ballads on the vendor 's string ,</l>
     <l n="5">And broad-edge bold-print posters by the wall .</l>
     <l n="6">He took such cognizance of men and things ,</l>
     <l n="7">If any beat a horse , you felt he saw ;</l>
     <l n="8">If any cursed a woman , he took note .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>This is an exact description of the way Robert Browning walked the streets of Florence . Only a few years after this poem was printed , he was glancing o'er the books on stalls in the square of San Lorenzo , and found the old yellow volume which he turned into an epic of humanity . The true poet “ scents ” the world , smells it out , as a dog locates game . A still stronger expression is used in Christmas-Eve , where the poets “ pried ” at life , turned up its surface in order to disclose all its hidden treasures of meaning .</p>

     <l n="4">You saw go up and down Valladolid ,</l>
     <l n="5">A man of mark , to know next time you saw .</l>
     <l n="6">His very serviceable suit of black</l>
     <l n="7">Was courtly once and conscientious still ,</l>
     <l n="8">And many might have worn it , though none did :</l>
     <l n="9">The cloak , that somewhat shone and showed the threads ,</l>
     <l n="10">Had purpose , and the ruff , significance .</l>
     <l n="11">He walked and tapped the pavement with his cane ,</l>
     <l n="12">Scenting the world , looking it full in face ,</l>
     <l n="13">An old dog , bald and blindish , at his heels .</l>
     <l n="14">They turned up , now , the alley by the church ,</l>
     <l n="15">That leads nowhither ; now , they breathed themselves</l>
     <l n="16">On the main promenade just at the wrong time :</l>
     <l n="17">You 'd come upon his scrutinizing hat ,</l>
     <l n="18">Making a peaked shade blacker than itself</l>
     <l n="19">Against the single window spared some house</l>
     <l n="20">Intact yet with its mouldered Moorish work ,—</l>
     <l n="21">Or else surprise the ferrel of his stick</l>
     <l n="22">Trying the mortar 's temper ‘ tween the chinks</l>
     <l n="23">Of some new shop a-building , French and fine .</l>
     <l n="24">He stood and watched the cobbler at his trade ,</l>
     <l n="25">The man who slices lemons into drink ,</l>
     <l n="26">The coffee-roaster 's brazier , and the boys</l>
     <l n="27">That volunteer to help him turn its winch .</l>
     <l n="28">He glanced o'er books on stalls with half an eye ,</l>
     <l n="29">And fly-leaf ballads on the vendor 's string ,</l>
     <l n="30">And broad-edge bold-print posters by the wall .</l>
     <l n="31">He took such cognizance of men and things ,</l>
     <l n="32">If any beat a horse , you felt he saw ;</l>
     <l n="33">If any cursed a woman , he took note ;</l>

     <l n="35">And found , less to your pleasure than surprise ,</l>
     <l n="36">He seemed to know you and expect as much .</l>
     <l n="37">So , next time that a neighbour 's tongue was loosed ,</l>
     <l n="38">It marked the shameful and notorious fact ,</l>
     <l n="39">We had among us , not so much a spy ,</l>
     <l n="40">As a recording chief-inquisitor ,</l>
     <l n="41">The town 's true master if the town but knew !</l>
     <l n="42">We merely kept a governor for form ,</l>
     <l n="43">While this man walked about and took account</l>
     <l n="44">Of all thought , said and acted , then went home ,</l>
     <l n="45">And wrote it fully to our Lord the King</l>
     <l n="46">Who has an itch to know things , he knows why ,</l>
     <l n="47">And reads them in his bedroom of a night .</l>
     <l n="48">Oh , you might smile ! there wanted not a touch ,</l>
     <l n="49">A tang of ... well , it was not wholly ease</l>
     <l n="50">As back into your mind the man 's look came .</l>
     <l n="51">Stricken in years a little ,— such a brow</l>
     <l n="52">His eyes had to live under !— clear as flint</l>
     <l n="53">On either side the formidable nose</l>

   <p>In common with all English poets — there is no exception — Browning loved nature . But he loved human nature so much more that when he contemplates natural objects he thinks of them in terms of humanity . This is exactly contrary to the conventional method . Most poets and novelists describe human faces in terms of outdoor nature : the heroine has “ stormy eyes , ” “ rainy eyes , ” her face is swept by “ gusts of passion , ” and so on , ad infinitum . I do not say that Browning 's is the better way ; I say it is his way , because he was obsessed by humanity . To take instances only from his first poem :</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Thou wilt remember one warm morn when winter</l>
     <l n="2">Crept aged from the earth , and spring 's first breath</l>

     <l n="4">So dark in the bare wood , when glistening</l>
     <l n="5">In the sunshine were white with coming buds ,</l>
     <l n="6">Like the bright side of a sorrow , and the banks</l>
     <l n="7">Had violets opening from sleep like eyes .</l>

   <p>Browning 's love for the dramatic was so intense that he carried it into every kind of poetry that he wrote . Various classes of his works he called Dramas , Dramatic Lyrics , Dramatic Romances , Dramatic Idyls , Dramatis Personae . In one of her prefaces , Elizabeth Barrett had employed — for the first time in English literature , I think — the term Dramatic Lyric . This naturally appealed to Browning , and he gave the title in 1842 to his first published collection of short poems . At first blush “ dramatic lyric ” sounds like a contradiction in terms , like “ non-mathematical algebra . ” Drama is the most objective branch of poetry , and the lyric the most subjective : but Browning was so intent upon the chronicling of all stages of life that he carried the methods of the drama into the lyric form , of which Meeting at Night may serve as an excellent example . Many of his short poems have the lyrical beauty of Shelley and Heine ; but they all represent the soul of some historical or imaginary person .</p>
   <p>At the very end of The Ring and the Book , Browning declared that human testimony was false , a statement that will be supported by any lawyer or judge of much court experience . Human testimony being worthless , there remains but one way for the poet to tell the truth about humanity , and that is through his art . The poet should use his skill not primarily with the idea of creating something beautiful , but with the main purpose of expressing the actual truth concerning human life and character . The highest art is the highest veracity , and this conforms to Browning 's theory of poetry . This was his ideal , and by adhering to this he hoped to save his soul . Browning believed that by living up to our best capacity we attained unto salvation . The man who hid his talent in the earth was really a lost soul . Like many truly great artists , Browning felt deeply the responsibility of his splendid endowment . In one of his letters to Miss Barrett , he said , “ I must write poetry and save my soul . ” In the last lines of The Ring and the Book we find this thought repeated :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">So , British public , who may like me yet ,</l>
     <l n="2">( Marry and amen ! ) learn one lesson hence</l>
     <l n="3">Of many which whatever lives should teach :</l>
     <l n="4">This lesson , that our human speech is naught ,</l>
     <l n="5">Our human testimony false , our fame</l>
     <l n="6">And human estimation words and wind .</l>
     <l n="7">Why take the artistic way to prove so much ?</l>
     <l n="8">Because , it is the glory and good of Art ,</l>
     <l n="9">That Art remains the one way possible</l>
     <l n="10">Of speaking truth , to minds like mine at least ....</l>
     <l n="11">But Art ,— wherein man nowise speaks to men ,</l>
     <l n="12">Only to mankind ,— Art may tell a truth</l>
     <l n="13">Obliquely , do the thing shall breed the thought ,</l>
     <l n="14">Nor wrong the thought , missing the mediate word .</l>
     <l n="15">So may you paint your picture , twice show truth ,</l>
     <l n="16">Beyond mere imagery on the wall ,—</l>
     <l n="17">So , note by note , bring music from your mind ,</l>
     <l n="18">Deeper than ever e'en Beethoven dived ,—</l>
     <l n="19">So write a book shall mean beyond the facts ,</l>
     <l n="20">Suffice the eye and save the soul beside .</l>
     <l n="21">And save the soul !</l>
   </lg>
   <p>From first to last Browning understood the prevailing criticism of his poetry , directed against its so-called lack of musical rhythm . He commented on it more than once . But he answered it always in the same way , in Pippa Passes , in the last stanzas of Pacchiarotto , and in the Epilogue to the same volume . He insisted that what the critics meant by melody was a childish jingle of rimes like Mother Goose . Referring to Sordello , he makes the Second Student in Pippa Passes remark , “ Instead of cramp couplets , each like a knife in your entrails , he should write , says Bluphocks , both classically and intelligibly .... One strip Cools your lip .... One bottle Clears your throttle . ” In Pacchiarotto , he calls to critics :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">And , what with your rattling and tinkling ,</l>
     <l n="2">Who knows but you give me an inkling</l>
     <l n="3">How music sounds , thanks to the jangle</l>
     <l n="4">Of regular drum and triangle ?</l>
     <l n="5">Whereby , tap-tap , chink-chink , ‘ tis proven</l>
     <l n="6">I break rule as bad as Beethoven .</l>
     <l n="7">“ That chord now — a groan or a grunt is't ?</l>
     <l n="8">Schumann 's self was no worse contrapuntist .</l>
     <l n="9">No ear ! or if ear , so tough-gristled —</l>
     <l n="10">He thought that he sung while he whistled ! ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Browning felt that there was at times a certain virtue in mere roughness : that there were ideas , which , if expressed in harsh phrase , would make a deeper impression , and so be longer remembered . The opening stanza of The Twins was meant to emphasise this point :</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Grand rough old Martin Luther</l>
     <l n="2">Bloomed fables — flowers on furze ,</l>
     <l n="3">The better the uncouther :</l>
     <l n="4">Do roses stick like burrs ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">Such a theory may help to explain the powerful line in Rabbi Ben</l>
     <l n="6">Ezra :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="7">Irks care the cropfull bird ? Frets doubt the maw-crammed beast ?</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Of course Browning 's theory of poetry does not justify or explain all the unmusical passages in his works . He felt , as every poet must , the difficulty of articulation — the disparity between his ideas and the verbal form he was able to give them . Browning had his trials in composition , and he placed in the mouth of the Pope his own ardent hope that in the next world there will be some means of communication better than language :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Expect nor question nor reply</l>
     <l n="2">At what we figure as God 's judgment bar !</l>
     <l n="3">None of this vile way by the barren words</l>
     <l n="4">Which , more than any deed , characterise</l>
     <l n="5">Man as made subject to a curse : no speech .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Over and over again , however , Browning declared that poetry should not be all sweetness . Flowers growing naturally here and there in a pasture are much more attractive than cut and gathered into a nosegay . As Luther 's long disquisitions are adorned with pretty fables , that bloom like flowers on furze , so , in the Epilogue to Pacchiarotto , Browning insisted that the wide fields of his verse are not without cowslips :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">And , friends , beyond dispute</l>
     <l n="2">I too have the cowslips dewy and dear .</l>
     <l n="3">Punctual as Springtide forth peep they :</l>
     <l n="4">But I ought to pluck and impound them , eh ?</l>
     <l n="5">Not let them alone , but deftly shear</l>
     <l n="6">And shred and reduce to — what may suit</l>
     <l n="7">Children , beyond dispute ?</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Now , there are many law-abiding and transparently honest persons who prefer anthologies to “ works , ” who love to read tiny volumes prettily bound , called “ Beauties of Ruskin , ” and who have substituted for the out-of-fashion “ Daily Food ” books , painted bits of cardboard with sweet sayings culled from popular idols of the day , with which they embellish the walls of their offices and bedrooms , in the hope that they may hoist themselves into a more hallowed frame of mind . This is the class — always with us , though more prosperous than the poor — who prefer a cut bouquet to the natural flowers in wood and meadow , and for whose comfort and convenience Browning declined to work . His poetry is too stiff for these readers , partly because they start with a preconceived notion of the function of poetry . Instead of being charmed , their first sensation is a shock . They honestly believe that the attitude of the mind in apprehending poetry should be passive , not active : is not the poet a public entertainer ? Did we not buy the book with the expectation of receiving immediate pleasure ? The anticipated delight of many persons when they open a volume of poems is almost physical , as it is when they settle themselves to hear certain kinds of music . They feel presumably as a comfortable cat does when her fur is fittingly stroked . The torture that many listeners suffered when they heard Wagner for the first time was not imaginary , it was real ; “ Oh , if somebody would only play a tune ! ” Yet Wagner converted thousands of these quondam sufferers , and conquered them without making any compromises . He simply enlarged their conception of what opera-music might mean . He gave them new sources of happiness without robbing them of the old . For my part , although I prefer Wagner 's to all other operas , I keenly enjoy Mozart 's Don Giovanni , Charpentier 's Louise , Gounod 's Faust , Strauss 's Salomé , Verdi 's Aida , and I never miss an opportunity to hear Gilbert and Sullivan . Almost all famous operas have something good in them except the works of Meyerbeer .</p>
   <p>We all have moods when the mind wishes to be lulled , soothed , charmed , hypnotised with agreeable melody , and in English literature we fortunately have many great poets who can perform this service .</p>
   <p>That strain again ! it had a dying fall .</p>
   <p>Tennyson was a veritable magician , who charmed with his genius hundreds and thousands of people . No arduous mental effort is necessary for the enjoyment of his verse , which is one reason why he is and will remain a popular poet . Browning can not be taken in just that way , any more than a man completely exhausted with the day 's work can enjoy Siegfried or Hedda Gabler . Active , constant cerebration on the part of the listener or the reader is essential . This excludes at once a considerable number to whom the effort of real thinking is as strange as it is oppressive . Browning is a stimulus , not a sedative ; his poetry is like an electric current which naturally fails to affect those who are non-conductors of poetry . As one of my undergraduate students tersely expressed it , “ Tennyson soothes our senses : Browning stimulates our thoughts . ” Poetry is in some ways like medicine . Tennyson quiets the nerves : Browning is a tonic : some have found Thomson 's Seasons invaluable for insomnia : the poetry of Swift is an excellent emetic .</p>
   <p>I do not quite understand the intense anger of many critics and readers over the eternal question of Browning 's obscurity . They have been harping on this theme for eighty years and show no more sign of exhaustion than a dog barking in the night . Why do the heathen rage ? Why do they not let Browning alone , and read somebody they can understand ? Browning is still gravely rebuked by many critics for having written Sordello . Over and over again we have been informed that the publication of this poem shattered his reputation for twenty-five years . Well , what of it ? what difference does it make now ? He seems to have successfully survived it . This huge work , which William Sharp called “ that colossal derelict upon the ocean of poetry , ” is destined to have an immortality all its own . From one point of view , we ought to be grateful for its publication . It has aroused inextinguishable laughter among the blessed gods . It is not witty in itself , but it is the cause of wit in many . Douglas Jerrold and Carlyle commented delightfully on it ; even Tennyson succeeded for once in saying something funny . One critic called it a fine house in which the architect had forgotten to put any stairs . Another called it a huge boil in which all the impurities in Browning 's system came to an impressive head , after which the patient , pure from poison , succeeded in writing the clear and beautiful Pippa Passes . Besides innumerable parodies that have been forgotten , Browning 's obscurity was the impenetrable flint that struck two mental flashes that belong to literature , Calverley 's Cock and the Bull , and Swinburne 's John Jones , a brilliant exposition of the perversities in that tedious poem , James Lee 's Wife . Not long ago , a young man sat by the lamplight , studying a thick volume with evident discomfort . To the friend who asked what he was doing , he replied , “ I 'm studying Browning . ”</p>
   <p>“ Why , no , you idiot , that is n't Browning : you are reading the index of first lines to the works of Wordsworth . ”</p>
   <p>“ By Jove ! you 're right ! But it sounds just like Browning . ”</p>
   <p>Browning 's place in English literature is not with the great verse-sculptors , not with the masters of imperishable beauty of form ; he does not belong to the glorious company where reign supreme Milton , Keats , and Tennyson ; his place is rather with the Interpreters of Life , with the poets who use their art to express the shine and shade of life 's tragicomedy — to whom the base , the trivial , the frivolous , the grotesque , the absurd seem worth reporting along with the pure , the noble , and the sublime , since all these elements are alike human . In this wide field of art , with the exception of Shakespeare , who is the exception to everything , the first-born and the last-born of all the great English poets know no equal in the five centuries that rolled between them . The first person to say this publicly was himself a poet and a devoted student of Form — Walter Savage Landor . When he said it , people thought it was mere hyperbole , the stressed language of compliment ; but we know now that Landor 's words are as true as they are beautiful :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Shakespeare is not our poet , but the world 's ,</l>
     <l n="2">Therefore on him no speech ! and brief for thee ,</l>
     <l n="3">Browning ! Since Chaucer was alive and hale ,</l>
     <l n="4">No man hath walk 'd along our roads with step</l>
     <l n="5">So active , so enquiring eye , or tongue</l>
     <l n="6">So varied in discourse .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Many critics who are now dead , and some that are yet alive , have predicted the speedy death of Browning 's reputation . This prediction seems to afford a certain class of critics a calm and holy joy . Some years ago , Mr. James Douglas , of London , solemnly announced the approaching demise . Browning will die , said he , even as Donne is dead , and for the same reason . But Donne is not quite dead .</p>
   <p>I must survive a thing ere know it dead .</p>
   <p>I think Donne will survive all our contemporary criticisms about him . Ben Jonson said that Donne , for not keeping of accent , deserved hanging . But Donne , though he forgot to keep step with the procession of poets , has survived many poets who tripped a regular measure . He has survived even Pope 's “ versification ” of his poems , one of the most unconsciously humorous things in English literature . Accent alone will not keep a man alive . Which poet of these latter days stands the better chance to remain , Francis Thompson , whose spiritual flame occasionally burned up accent , or Alfred Austin , who studied to preserve accent through a long life ? Accent is indeed important ; but raiment is of little value unless it clothes a living body . Does Browning 's best poetry smell of mortality ? Nearly every new novel I read in English has quotations from Browning without the marks , sure evidence that the author has read him and assumes that the readers of the novel have a like acquaintance . When Maeterlinck wrote his famous play , Monna Vanna , he took one of the scenes directly from Browning 's Luria : he said that he had been inspired by Browning : that Browning is one of the greatest poets that England has ever produced : that to take a scene from him is a kind of public homage , such as we pay to Homer , Aeschylus , and Shakespeare .</p>
   <p>With the exception of Shakespeare , any other English poet could now be spared more easily than Browning . For , owing to his aim in poetry , and his success in attaining it , he gave us much vital truth and beauty that we should seek elsewhere in vain ; and , as he said in the Epilogue to Pacchiarotio , the strong , heady wine of his verse may become sweet in process of time .</p>
   <p>III</p>
   <p>LYRICS</p>
   <p>A pure lyric , as distinguished from other kinds of poetry , narrative , descriptive , epic , dramatic , should have three characteristic qualities , immediately evident on the first reading : it should be short , it should be melodious , it should express only one mood . A very long lyrical poem has never been written , and probably could not be : a lyric without fluent melody is unthinkable : and a poem representing a great variety of moods would more properly be classed as descriptive or dramatic than lyrical . Examples of the perfect lyric in nineteenth century English poetry are Shelley 's I Arise From Dreams of Thee ; Keats 's Bright Star ; Byron 's She Walks in Beauty ; Tennyson 's Break , Break , Break . In each one of these notable illustrations the poem is a brief song of passion , representing the mood of the singer at that moment .</p>
   <p>There are innumerable lyrical passages in Browning 's long poems , and in his dramatic monologues ; there are splendid outbursts of melody . He could not be ranked among the greatest English poets if he had not been one of our greatest singers . But we do not go to Browning primarily for song . He is not one of our greatest lyrical poets . It is certain , however , that he could have been had he chosen to be . He wrote a sufficient number of pure lyrics to prove his quality and capacity . But he was so much more deeply interested in the study of the soul than in the mere expression of beauty — he was so essentially , from Pauline to Asolando — a dramatic poet , that his great contribution to literature is seen in profound and subtle interpretations of the human heart . It is fortunate that he made the soul his specialty , because English literature is wonderfully rich in song : there are many poets who can thrill us with music : but there is only one Browning , and there is no group of writers in any literature among which he can be classed .</p>
   <p>Browning 's dramatic lyrics differ from Tennyson 's short poems as the lyrics of Donne differed from those of Campion ; but Browning occasionally tried his hand at the composition of a pure lyric , as if to say , “ You see I can write like this when I choose . ” Therein lies his real superiority to almost all other English poets : he could do their work , but they could not do his . It is significant that his first poem , Pauline , should have deeply impressed two men of precisely opposite types of mind . These two were John Stuart Mill and Dante Gabriel Rossetti — their very names illustrating beautifully the difference in their mental tastes and powers . Carlyle called Mill a “ logic-chopping engine , ” because his intellectual processes were so methodical , systematic , hard-headed : Rossetti was a master of color and harmony . Yet Mill found in Pauline the workings of a powerful mind : and Rossetti 's sensitive temperament was charmed with the wonderful pictures and lovely melodies it contained .</p>
   <p>I like to think that Mill read , paused , re-read and meditated on this passage :</p>

   <p>It is rather singular , in view of the great vogue of the sonnet in the nineteenth century , that neither Tennyson nor Browning should have succeeded in this form . The two men wrote very few sonnets — Browning fewer than Tennyson — and neither ever wrote a great one . Longfellow , so inferior in most respects to his two great English contemporaries , was an incomparably superior sonnetteer . Tennyson 's sonnets are all mediocre : Browning did not publish a single sonnet in the final complete edition of his works . He did however print a very few on special occasions , and when he was twenty-two years old , between the composition of Pauline and Paracelsus , there appeared in the Monthly Repository a sonnet beginning</p>
   <p>Eyes calm beside thee ( Lady , could'st thou know ! )</p>
   <p>which is the best example from his pen that has been preserved . Although he did not think much of it in later years , it has been frequently reprinted , and is worth keeping ; both for the ardor of its passion , and because it is extraordinary that he should have begun so very early in his career a form of verse that he practically abandoned . This sonnet may have been addressed to a purely imaginary ideal ; but it is possible that the young man had in mind Eliza Flower , for whom he certainly had a boyish love , and who was probably the original of Pauline . She and her sister , Sarah Flower , the author of Nearer , My God , to Thee , were both older than Browning , and both his intimate friends during the period of his adolescence .</p>

   <p>The songs in Paracelsus ( 1835 ) prove that Browning was a genuine lyrical poet : the best of them , Over the Sea Our Galleys Went , is more properly a dramatic monologue : but the song in the second act , by Aprile ( who I think stands for Keats ) is a pure lyric , and so are the two stanzas sung by Paracelsus in the fourth act . There are lines here which suggest something of the drowsy music of Tennyson 's Lotos-Eaters , published in 1832 :</p>

   <p>The songs in Pippa Passes ( 1841 ) are ail exquisite works of art . The one on the King had been printed in the Monthly Repository in 1835 ; the others appeared for the first time in the published drama . All of them are vitally connected with the action of the plot , differing in this respect from the Elizabethan custom of simple interpolation . The song sung in the early morning by the girl in her chamber</p>
   <p>All service ranks the same with God</p>
   <p>contains the philosophy of the play — human lives are inextricably intertwined , and all are dependent on the will of God . No individual can separate himself either from other men and women , or can sever the connection between himself and his Father in Heaven . The first stanza repeats the teaching of Milton in the sonnet on his blindness : the second is more definitely connected with Pippa 's professional work .</p>

   <p>a remark never made either by Pippa or by Browning . In Browning 's philosophy all may be right with the world , and yet far from well . Perhaps it is too prosaically minute to point out in so beautiful a poem , a scientific error , but at seven o'clock on the first of January in Asolo the sun is still below the horizon .</p>

   <p>The two lyrics , Home-Thoughts , from the Sea and Home-Thoughts , from Abroad , were written during Browning 's first Italian journey in 1838 ; and it seems strange that he did not print them among the Dramatic Lyrics of 1842 but reserved them for the Dramatic Romances of 1845 ; especially as he subsequently transferred them to the Lyrics . They are both notable on account of the strong feeling for England which they express . No great English poet has said so little of England as Browning , though his own feelings were always keenly patriotic . Even in Pauline , a poem without a country , there occur the two lines</p>
   <p>... and I cherish most My love of England — how her name , a word Of hers in a strange tongue makes my heart beat !</p>
   <p>The allusion to the English thrush has given immortality to Home-Thoughts , from Abroad . Many had observed that the thrush sings a lilt , and immediately repeats it : but Browning was the first to give a pretty reason for it . The thrush seems to say , “ You think that beautiful melody is an accident ? Well , I will show you it is no fluke , I will sing it correctly right over again . ” Browning was not in Italy in April — perhaps he wrote the first stanza on the voyage , as he wrote Home-Thoughts , from the Sea , and added the second stanza about May and June after he had reached the country of his quest .</p>

   <p>The collection of poems called James Lee 's Wife , published in the Dramatis Personae ( 1864 ) , seems to me illustrative of Browning 's worst faults ; it is obscure , harsh , and dull . But it contains one fine lyric descriptive of an autumn morning , a morning , by the way , much commoner in America during autumn than anywhere in Europe . The second stanza is nobly ethical in its doctrine of love — that we should not love only those persons whom we can respect , for true love seeks no profit . It must be totally free from the prospect of gain . A beautiful face inspired another lyric in this volume , and Browning drew upon his memories of Correggio to give the perfect tone to the poem .</p>

   <p>One of the most original and powerful of Browning 's lyrical pieces comes just where we should least expect it , at the end of that dark , dreary , and all but impenetrable wilderness of verse , Fifine at the Fair . It serves as an Epilogue , but it would be difficult and unprofitable to attempt to discover its connection with the poem to which is appended . Its metre is unique in Browning , and stirs the heart with inexpressible force . In music it most closely resembles the swift thrilling roll of a snare drum , and can be read aloud in exact accord with that instrument . Browning calls it The Householder , and of course it represents in his own life the anticipated moment when the soul leaves its house to unite with its mate . Out of the catastrophe of death appears a radiant vision which really seems too good to be true .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ What , and is it really you again ? ” quoth I :</l>
     <l n="2">“ I again , what else did you expect ? ” quoth She .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The man is weary of his old patched up body , now no longer needed : weary of the noisy nuisances of life , and the tiresome and futile gabble of humanity : resentful , now that his spirit has actually survived death , when he remembers the scientific books he had read which almost struck despair in him . He petulantly says ,</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ If you knew but how I dwelt down here ! ” quoth I :</l>
     <l n="2">“ And was I so better off up there ? ” quoth She .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>He is for immediate departure , leaving his empty carcass where it lies ; but she reminds him of the necessity for decent burial . Much is to be done before they can begin to enjoy together their new and freer existence . There is the body to be buried ; the obituary notices to be written for the papers : the parson and undertaker to be summoned : the formalities of the funeral : the selection of a proper tombstone , with care for the name and accurate carving of the date of death thereupon : and finally a bit of verse in the way of final flourish . So these two spirits look on with impatience at the funeral exercises , at the weeping friends left behind , and not until the coffin is under ground , are they at liberty to depart from terrestial scenes . If we do survive the death of the body , with what curious sensations must we regard the solemn ceremonies of its interment !</p>

    <p>IV</p>
   <p>DRAMATIC LYRICS</p>
   <p>Browning 's poetic career extended from 1833 to 1889 , nearly sixty years of fairly continuous composition . We may make a threefold division : first , the thirteen years before his marriage in 1846 ; second , the fifteen years of married life , closing in 1861 ; third , the remaining twenty-eight years . During the first period he published twelve works ; during the second , two ; during the third , eighteen . The fact that so little was published during the years when his wife was alive may be accounted for by the fact that the condition of her health required his constant care , and that after the total failure of Men and Women ( 1855 ) to attract any popular attention , Browning for some time spent most of his energy in clay-modelling , giving up poetry altogether . Not long before the death of Mrs. Browning , he was busy writing Prince Hohenstiel-Schwangau , although he did not publish it until the right moment , which came in 1871 . After the appearance of Dramatis Personae ( 1864 ) , and The Ring and the Book ( 1868-9 ) , Browning 's fame spread like a prairie fire ; and it was quite natural that his immense reputation was a sharp spur to composition . One is more ready to speak when one is sure of an audience . Capricious destiny , however , willed that the books which sold the fastest after publication , were , with few exceptions , the least interesting and valuable of all the poet 's performances . Perhaps he did not take so much care now that his fame was assured ; perhaps the fires in his own mind were dying ; perhaps the loss of his wife robbed him of necessary inspiration , as it certainly robbed him of the best critic he ever had , and the only one to whom he paid any serious attention . When we remember that some of the Dramatic Romances , Luria , A Soul 's Tragedy , Christmas-Eve , Men and Women , and some of the Dramatis Personae were read by her in manuscript , and that The Ring and the Book was written in the shadow of her influence , we begin to realise how much she helped him . Their love-letters during the months that preceded their marriage indicate the excellence of her judgment , her profound and sympathetic understanding of his genius and his willingness to listen to her advice . He did not intend to publish A Soul 's Tragedy at all , though it is one of his most subtle and interesting dramas , and only did so at her request ; part of the manuscript of Christmas-Eve is in her handwriting ,</p>
   <p>It is worth remembering too that in later years Browning hated to write poetry , and nothing but a sense of duty kept him during the long mornings at his desk . He felt the responsibility of genius without its inspiration .</p>
   <p>Browning has given a little trouble to bibliographers by redistributing the poems originally published in the three works , Dramatic Lyrics ( 1842 ) , Dramatic Romances and Lyrics ( 1845 ) , and Men and Women ( 1855 ) . The Dramatic Lyrics at first contained sixteen pieces ; the Dramatic Romances and Lyrics twenty-three ; the Men and Women fifty-one . In the final arrangement the first of these included fifty ; the second , called simply Dramatic Romances , twenty-five ; whilst the last was reduced to thirteen . He also changed the titles of many of the poems , revised the text somewhat , classified two separate poems under one title , Claret and Tokay , and Here 's to Nelson 's Memory , under the heading Nationality in Drinks , and united the two sections of Saul in one poem . It is notable that he omitted not one , and indeed it is remarkable that with the exception of The Boy and the Angel , A Lover 's Quarrel , Mesmerism , and Another Way of Love , every poem in the long list has the indubitable touch of genius ; and even these four are not the worst of Browning 's compositions .</p>
   <p>It would have seemed to us perhaps more fitting if Browning had grouped the contents of all three works under the one heading Men and Women ; for that would fairly represent the sole subject of his efforts . Perhaps he felt that the title was too general , and as a matter of fact , it would apply equally well to his complete poetical works . I think , however , that he especially loved the appellation Dramatic Lyrics , for he put over half of the poems finally under that category . The word “ dramatic ” obsessed Browning .</p>
   <p>What is a dramatic lyric ? When Tennyson published in 1842 his Ulysses , a Yankee farmer in America made in one sentence three remarks about it : a statement and two prophecies . He said that Ulysses belonged to a high class of poetry , destined to be the highest , and to be more cultivated in the next generation . Now Ulysses is both a dramatic lyric and a dramatic monologue , and Tennyson never wrote anything better than this poem . As it became increasingly evident that the nineteenth century was not going to have a great literary dramatic movement on the stage , while at the same time the interest in human nature had never been keener , the poets began to turn their attention to the interpretation of humanity by the representation of historical or imaginary individuals speaking : and their speech was to reveal the secrets of the human soul , in its tragedy and comedy , in its sublimity and baseness , in its nobility and folly . Later in life Tennyson cultivated sedulously the dramatic monologue ; and Browning , the most original force in literature that the century produced , after abandoning his early attempts at success on the stage , devoted practically the entire strength of his genius to this form of poetry . Emerson was a wise man .</p>
   <p>In reshuffling the short poems in the three works mentioned above , it is not always easy to see the logic of the distribution and it would be interesting if we could know the reasons that guided the poet in the classification of particular poems . Thus it is perfectly clear why Incident of the French Camp , Count Gismond , and In a Gondola were taken from the Dramatic Lyrics and placed among the Dramatic Romances ; it is easy to see why The Lost Leader and Home-Thoughts , from Abroad were taken from the Romances and placed among the Lyrics ; it is not quite so clear why Rudel and Artemis Prologizes were taken from the Lyrics and classed among Men and Women , when nearly all the poems originally published under the latter head were changed to Lyrics and Romances . In changing How They Brought the Good News from the Dramatic Romances , where it was originally published , to Dramatic Lyrics , Browning probably felt that the lyrical sound of the piece was more important than the story : but it really is a dramatic romance . Furthermore , My Last Duchess would seem to fall more properly under the heading Men and Women ; Browning , however , took it from the Dramatic Lyrics and placed it among the Dramatic Romances . In most cases , however , the reason for the transfer of individual poems is clear ; and a study of the classification is of positive assistance toward the understanding of the piece .</p>
   <p>In the eight volumes published from 1841 to 1846 , which Browning called Bells and Pomegranates , meaning simply Sound and Sense , Meat and Music , only two are collections of short poems and the other six contain exclusively plays — seven in all , two being printed together in the last volume . Browning intended the whole Bells and Pomegranates series to be devoted to the drama , as one may see by the original preface to Pippa Passes : but that drama and the next did not sell , and the publisher suggested that he include some short poems . This explains why the third volume is filled with lyrics ; and in a note published with it , Browning half apologised for what might seem a departure from his original plan , saying these two might properly fall under the head of dramatic pieces ; being , although lyrical in expression , “ always dramatic in principle , and so many utterances of so many imaginary persons , not mine . ”</p>
   <p>He means then by a dramatic lyric a poem that is short , that is musical , but that is absolutely not subjective — does not express or betray the writer 's own ideas nor even his mood , as is done in Tennyson 's ideal lyric , Crossing the Bar . A dramatic lyric is a composition lyrical in form , and dramatic in subject-matter ; remembering all the time that by dramatic we do not necessarily mean anything exciting but simply something objective , something entirely apart from the poet 's own feelings . On the stage this is accomplished by the creation of separate characters who in propria persona express views that may or may not be in harmony with the poet 's own . Thus , Macbeth 's speech , beginning</p>
   <p>Out , out , brief candle !</p>
   <p>is really a dramatic lyric ; because it is lyrical in form , and it expresses views on the value of life which could hardly have been held by Shakespeare , though they seem eminently fitting from the lips of a man who had tried to gain the whole world by losing his soul , and had succeeded in losing both .</p>
   <p>In view of Browning 's love for this form of verse , it is interesting to remember that the first two independent short poems that he ever wrote and retained in his works are both genuine dramatic lyrics . These are Porphyria 's Lover and Johannes Agricola , printed in the Monthly Repository in 1836 , when Browning was twenty-four years old . Thus early did he show both aptitude for this form and excellence in it , for each of these pieces is a work of genius . They were meant to be studies in abnormal psychology , for they were printed together in the Dramatic Lyrics under the caption Madhouse Cells . Browning was very young then , and naturally thought a man who believed in predestination and a man who killed the woman he loved were both insane ; but after a longer experience of life , and seeing how many strange creatures walk the streets , he ceased to call these two men , obsessed by religion and obsessed by love , mad . If Porphyria 's lover is mad , there is method in his madness . Her superior social rank has stifled hitherto the instincts of the heart ; she has never given her lover any favors ; but to-night , at the dinner-dance , by one of those strange and inexplicable caprices that make Woman the very Genius of the Unexpected , she has a vision . In the midst of the lights and the laughter , she sees her lonely lover sitting dejectedly in his cold and cheerless cottage , thinking of her . She slips away from the gay company , trips through the pouring rain , and enters the dark room like an angel of light . After kindling a blazing fire in the grate , she kindles her lover 's hope-dead heart ; she draws him to her and places his head on her naked shoulder . Suddenly a thought comes to him ; one can see the light of murder in his eyes . At this moment she is sublime , fit for Heaven : for the first time in her life , a noble impulse has triumphed over the debasing conventions of society ; if he lets her go , she will surely fall from grace , and become a lost soul . He strangles her with her yellow hair , risking damnation for her salvation . So the quick and the dead sit together through the long night .</p>

     <l n="2">The rain set early in to-night ,</l>
     <l n="3">The sullen wind was soon awake ,</l>
     <l n="4">It tore the elm-tops down for spite ,</l>
     <l n="5">And did its worst to vex the lake :</l>

     <l n="7">When glided in Porphyria ; straight</l>
     <l n="8">She shut the cold out and the storm ,</l>
     <l n="9">And kneeled and made the cheerless grate</l>
     <l n="10">Blaze up , and all the cottage warm ;</l>
     <l n="11">Which done , she rose , and from her form</l>
     <l n="12">Withdrew the dripping cloak and shawl ,</l>
     <l n="13">And laid her soiled gloves by , untied</l>
     <l n="14">Her hat and let the damp hair fall ,</l>
     <l n="15">And , last , she sat down by my side</l>
     <l n="16">And called me . When no voice replied ,</l>
     <l n="17">She put my arm about her waist ,</l>
     <l n="18">And made her smooth white shoulder bare ,</l>
     <l n="19">And all her yellow hair displaced ,</l>
     <l n="20">And , stooping , made my cheek lie there ,</l>
     <l n="21">And spread , o'er all , her yellow hair ,</l>
     <l n="22">Murmuring how she loved me — she</l>
     <l n="23">Too weak , for all her heart 's endeavour ,</l>
     <l n="24">To set its struggling passion free</l>
     <l n="25">From pride , and vainer ties dissever ,</l>
     <l n="26">And give herself to me for ever .</l>
     <l n="27">But passion sometimes would prevail ,</l>
     <l n="28">Nor could to-night 's gay feast restrain</l>
     <l n="29">A sudden thought of one so pale</l>
     <l n="30">For love of her , and all in vain :</l>
     <l n="31">So , she was come through wind and rain .</l>
     <l n="32">Be sure I looked up at her eyes</l>
     <l n="33">Happy and proud ; at last I knew</l>
     <l n="34">Porphyria worshipped me ; surprise</l>
     <l n="35">Made my heart swell , and still it grew</l>
     <l n="36">While I debated what to do .</l>
     <l n="37">That moment she was mine , mine , fair ,</l>
     <l n="38">Perfectly pure and good : I found</l>
     <l n="39">A thing to do , and all her hair</l>
     <l n="40">In one long yellow string I wound</l>
     <l n="41">Three times her little throat around ,</l>
     <l n="42">And strangled her . No pain felt she ;</l>
     <l n="43">I am quite sure she felt no pain .</l>
     <l n="44">As a shut bud that holds a bee ,</l>
     <l n="45">I warily oped her lids : again</l>
     <l n="46">Laughed the blue eyes without a stain .</l>
     <l n="47">And I untightened next the tress</l>
     <l n="48">About her neck ; her cheek once more</l>
     <l n="49">Blushed bright beneath my burning kiss :</l>
     <l n="50">I propped her head up as before ,</l>
     <l n="51">Only , this time my shoulder bore</l>
     <l n="52">Her head , which droops upon it still ;</l>
     <l n="53">The smiling rosy little head ,</l>
     <l n="54">So glad it has its utmost will ,</l>
     <l n="55">That all it scorned at once is fled ,</l>
     <l n="56">And I , its love , am gained instead !</l>
     <l n="57">Porphyria 's love : she guessed not how</l>
     <l n="58">Her darling one wish would be heard .</l>
     <l n="59">And thus we sit together now ,</l>
     <l n="60">And all night long we have not stirred ,</l>
     <l n="61">And yet God has not said a word !</l>
    </lg>

   <p>What is the meaning of that last enigmatical line ? Does it mean that the expected bolt from the sky has not fallen , that God approves of the murder ? Or does it mean that the man is vaguely disappointed , that he had hoped to hear a voice from Heaven , saying , “ This is my beloved son , in whom I am well pleased ” ? Or does it mean that the Power above is wholly indifferent , “ when the sky , which noticed all , makes no disclosure ” ?</p>
   <p>In Johannes Agricola , Browning wrote a lyric setting forth the strange and yet largely accepted doctrine that Almighty God before the foundations of the earth were laid , predestined a few of the coming population to everlasting bliss and the vast majority to eternal torture . This is by no means a meditation in a madhouse cell , as Browning first believed ; but might logically be the reflections of a nineteenth century Presbyterian clergyman , seated in his comfortable library . It is the ecstatic mystical joy of one who realises , that through no merit of his own , he is numbered among the elect . Sir Thomas Browne quaintly pictured to himself the surprise of the noble , upright men of antiquity , when they wake up in hell simply because they did not believe on One of whom they had never heard ; so Johannes speculates on the ironical fate of monks , ascetics , women and children , whose lives were full of innocence and purity , who nevertheless reach ultimately the lake of fire . Praise God for it ! for if I could understand Him , I could not praise Him . How much more noble this predestinating God is than one who should reward virtue , and thus make eternal bliss a matter of calculation and bargain !</p>

   <p>Perhaps Browning attempted to show the dramatic quality of his lyrics by finally placing at the very beginning the Cavalier Tunes and The Lost Leader ; for the former voice in eloquent language the hatred of democratic ideas , and the latter , in language equally strenuous , is a glorification of democracy . Imagine Browning himself saying what he places in the mouth of his gallant cavaliers — “ Hampden to hell ! ” In the second , The Lost Leader , nothing was farther from Browning 's own feelings than a personal attack on Wordsworth , whom he regarded with reverence ; in searching for an example of a really great character who had turned from the popular to the aristocratic party , he happened to think of the change from radicalism to conservatism exhibited by Wordsworth . Love for the lost leader is still strong in the breasts of his quondam followers who now must fight him ; in Heaven he will not only be pardoned , he will be first there as he was always first here . In the following lines , the prepositions are interesting :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Shakespeare was of us , Milton was for us ,</l>
     <l n="2">Burns , Shelley , were with us .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Shakespeare was indeed of the common people , but so far as we can conjecture , certainly not for them ; Milton was not of them , but was wholly for them , being indeed regarded as an anarchist ; Burns was a peasant , and Shelley a blue-blood , but both were with the popular cause . Browning himself , as we happen to know from one of his personal sonnets , was an intense Liberal in feeling .</p>

   <p>The poem Cristina ( 1842 ) , while not very remarkable as poetry , is notable because it contains thus early in Browning 's career , four of his most important doctrines . The more one studies Browning , the more one is convinced that the poet 's astonishing mental vigor is shown not in the number and variety of his ideas , but rather in the number and variety of illustrations of them . I can not at this moment think of any poet , dramatist or novelist who has invented so many plots as Browning . He seems to present to us a few leading ideas in a vast series of incarnations . Over and over again the same thoughts , the same doctrines are repeated ; but the scenery , the situations , and the characters are never alike . Here is where he remains true to the theory set forth in Transcendentalism ; the poet should not produce thoughts but rather concrete images of them ; or , as he says in the closing lines of The Ring and the Book , Art must do the thing that breeds the thought .</p>
   <p>In Cristina , four of Browning 's fundamental articles of faith are expressed : the doctrine of the elective affinities ; the doctrine of success through failure ; the doctrine that time is measured not by the clock and the calendar , but by the intensity of spiritual experiences ; the doctrine that life on earth is a trial and a test , the result of which will be seen in the higher and happier development when the soul is freed from the limitations of time and space .</p>
   <p>The expression “ elective affinities ” as applied to human beings was first brought into literature , I believe , by no less a person than Goethe , who in his novel , published in 1809 , which he called Elective Affinities ( Wahlverwandschaften ) , showed the tremendous force which tends to draw together certain persons of opposite sexes . The term was taken from chemistry , where an elective affinity means the “ force by which the atoms of bodies of dissimilar nature unite ” ; elective affinity is then simply a chemical force .</p>
   <p>In Goethe 's novel , Charlotte thus addresses the Captain : “ Would you tell me briefly what is meant here by Affinities ? ” The Captain replied , “ In all natural objects with which we are acquainted , we observe immediately that they have a certain relation . ” Charlotte : “ Let me try and see whether I can understand where you are bringing me . As everything has a reference to itself , so it must have some relation to others . ” Edward interrupts : “ And that will be different according to the natural differences of the things themselves . Sometimes they will meet like friends and old acquaintances ; they will come rapidly together , and unite without either having to alter itself at all — as wine mixes with water . ” Charlotte : “ One can almost fancy that in these simple forms one sees people that one is acquainted with . ” The Captain : “ As soon as our chemical chest arrives , we can show you a number of entertaining experiments , which will give you a clearer idea than words , and names , and technical expressions . ” Charlotte : “ It appears to me that if you choose to call these strange creatures of yours related , the relationship is not so much a relationship of blood as of soul or of spirit . ” The Captain : “ We had better keep to the same instances of which we have already been speaking . Thus , what we call limestone is a more or less pure calcareous earth in combination with a delicate acid , which is familiar to us in the form of a gas . Now , if we place a piece of this stone in diluted sulphuric acid , this will take possession of the lime , and appear with it in the form of gypsum , the gaseous acid at the same time going off in vapour . Here is a case of separation : a combination arises , and we believe ourselves now justified in applying to it the words ‘ Elective Affinity ; ’ it really looks as if one relation had been deliberately chosen in preference to another . ” Charlotte : “ Forgive me , as I forgive the natural philosopher . I can not see any choice in this ; I see a natural necessity rather , and scarcely that . Opportunity makes relations as it makes thieves : and as long as the talk is only of natural substances , the choice appears to be altogether in the hands of the chemist who brings the creatures together . Once , however , let them be brought together , and then God have mercy on them . ” The scientific conversation is summed up by their all agreeing that the chemical term “ elective affinities ” can properly be applied in analogy to human beings .</p>
   <p>An elective affinity as applied to men and women may result in happiness or misery ; or may be frustrated by a still superior prudential or moral force . The law of elective affinity being a force , it is naturally unaware of any human artificial obstacles , such as a total difference in social rank , or the previous marriage of one or both of the parties . If two independent individuals meet and are drawn together by the law of elective affinities , they may marry and live happily forever after ; if another marriage has already taken place , as in Goethe 's story , the result may be tragedy . In Cristina , the elective affinities assert their force between a queen and a private individual ; the result is , at least temporarily , unfortunate for the simple reason that the lady , although drawn toward the man by the workings of this mysterious force , is controlled even more firmly by the bondage of social convention ; she behaves in a contrary manner to that shown by the stooping lady in Maurice Hewlett 's story . This force needs only one moment , one glance , to assert its power :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">She should never have looked at me</l>
     <l n="2">If she meant I should not love her !</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Love in Browning is often love at first sight ; no prolonged acquaintance is necessary ; not even a spoken word , or any physical contact .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Doubt you whether</l>
     <l n="2">This she felt as , looking at me ,</l>
     <l n="3">Mine and her souls rushed together ?</l>
    </lg>

     <l n="4">In Tennyson 's Locksley Hall ( published the same year ) , contact was</l>
     <l n="5">important :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="6">And our spirits rushed together at the touching of the lips .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Browning 's portrayal of love shows that it can be a wireless telegraphy , that , in the instance of Cristina and her lover , exerted its force across a crowded room ; in The Statue and the Bust , it is equally powerful across a public square in Florence . The glance , or as Donne expresses it , the “ twisted eye-beams , ” is an important factor in Browning 's poetry — sufficient to unite two souls throughout all eternity , as it does in Tristan und Isolde . Browning repeats his favorite doctrine of the elective affinities in Evelyn Hope , Count Gismond , In a Gondola , Dis Aliter Visum , Youth and Art , and other poems ; and its noblest expression is perhaps in that wonderful scene in the crowded theatre at Arezzo ; whilst the flippant audience are gazing at a silly musical comedy , the sad eyes of Pompilia encounter the grave , serious regard of Caponsacchi , and the two young hearts are united forever .</p>
   <p>Another leading idea in Browning 's philosophy is Success in Failure . This paradox is indeed a corner-stone in the construction of his thought . Every noble soul must fail in life , because every noble soul has an ideal . We may be encouraged by temporary successes , but we must be inspired by failure . Browning can forgive any daring criminal ; but he can not forgive the man who is selfishly satisfied with his attainments and his position , and thus accepts compromises with life . The soul that ceases to grow is utterly damned . The damnation of contentment is shown with beauty and fervor in one of Browning 's earliest lyrics , Over the Sea Our Galleys Went . The voyagers were weary of the long journey , they heeded not the voice of the pilot Conscience , they accommodated their ideals to their personal convenience . The reason why Browning could not forgive Andrea was not because he was Andrea del Sarto , the son of a tailor ; it was because he was known as the Faultless Painter , because he could actually realise his dreams . The text of that whole poem is found in the line</p>
   <p>Ah , but a man 's reach should exceed his grasp .</p>
   <p>In Cristina , the man 's love is not rewarded here , he fails ; but he has aimed high , he has loved a queen . He will always love her — in losing her he has found a guiding principle for his own life , which will lead him ever up and on .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">She has lost me , I have gained her ;</l>
     <l n="2">Her soul 's mine : and thus , grown perfect ,</l>
     <l n="3">I shall pass my life 's remainder .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Her body I have lost : some other man will possess that : but her soul I gained in the moment when our eyes met , and my life has reached a higher plane and now has a higher motive . In failure I reach real success .</p>
   <p>This doctrine , illustrated repeatedly in Browning 's works , is stated explicitly in Rabbi Ben Ezra :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">For thence ,— a paradox</l>
     <l n="2">Which comforts while it mocks ,—</l>
     <l n="3">Shall life succeed in that it seems to fail :</l>
     <l n="4">What I aspired to be ,</l>
     <l n="5">And was not , comforts me :</l>
     <l n="6">A brute I might have been , but would not sink i ’ the scale .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The thought that life is not measured by length of days is brought out clearly in Cristina . We constantly read in the paper interviews with centenarians , who tell us how to prolong our lives by having sufficient sleep , by eating moderately , by refraining from worry . But , as a writer in a southern journal expressed it , Why do these aged curiosities never tell us what use they have made of this prolonged existence ? Mark Twain said cheerfully , “ Methuselah lived nine hundred and sixty-nine years ; but what of that ? There was nothing doing . ” No drama on the stage is a success unless it has what we call a supreme moment ; and the drama of our individual lives can not be really interesting or important unless it has some moments when we live intensely , when we live longer than some persons live in years ; moments that settle our purpose and destiny .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Oh , we 're sunk enough here , God knows !</l>
     <l n="2">But not quite so sunk that moments ,</l>
     <l n="3">Sure , tho ’ seldom , are denied us ,</l>
     <l n="4">When the spirit 's true endowments</l>
     <l n="5">Stand out plainly from its false ones ,</l>
     <l n="6">And apprise it if pursuing</l>
     <l n="7">Or the right way or the wrong way ,</l>
     <l n="8">To its triumph or undoing .</l>
     <l n="9">There are flashes struck from midnights ,</l>
     <l n="10">There are fire-flames noondays kindle ,</l>
     <l n="11">Whereby piled-up honours perish ,</l>
     <l n="12">Whereby swollen ambitions dwindle .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>An American public man who one day fell in public esteem as far as Lucifer , said that it had taken him fifty years to build up a great reputation , and that he had lost it all in one forenoon . The dying courtier in Paracelsus had such a moment .</p>
   <p>Finally , in Cristina , we find that ardent belief in a future life that lifts its head so often and so resolutely in Browning 's poetry , and on which , as we shall see later , his optimism is founded . Science tells us that the matter of which the universe is composed is indestructible ; Browning believes even more strongly in the permanence of spirit . Aspiration , enthusiasm , love would not be given to us to have their purposes broken off , not if this is a rational and economic universe ; the important thing is not to have our hopes fulfilled here , the important thing is to keep hoping . Such love as the man had for Cristina must eventually find its full satisfaction so long as it remains the guiding principle of his life , which will serve as a test of his tenacity .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Life will just hold out the proving</l>
     <l n="2">Both our powers , alone and blended :</l>
     <l n="3">And then , come next life quickly !</l>
     <l n="4">This world 's use will have been ended .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Precisely the same situation and the same philosophical result of it are illustrated in the exquisite lyric , Evelyn Hope . The lover is frustrated not by social distinctions , but by death . The girl is lost to him here , but the power of love is not quenched nor even lessened by this disaster . The man 's ardor will steadily increase during the remaining years of his earthly existence ; and then his soul will start out confident on its quest .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">God above</l>
     <l n="2">Is great to grant , as mighty to make ,</l>
     <l n="3">And creates the love to reward the love :</l>
     <l n="4">I claim you still , for my own love 's sake !</l>
     <l n="5">Delayed it may be for more lives yet ,</l>
     <l n="6">Through worlds I shall traverse , not a few :</l>
     <l n="7">Much is to learn , much to forget ,</l>
     <l n="8">Ere the time be come for taking you .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>This doctrine , that earthly existence is a mere test of the soul to determine its fitness for entering upon an eternal and freer stage of development , is frequently set forth in Browning . The apostle John makes it quite clear in A Death in the Desert ; and in Abt Vogler , the inspired musician sings</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">And what is our failure here but a triumph 's evidence</l>
     <l n="2">For the fulness of the days ? Have we withered or agonised ?</l>
     <l n="3">Why else was the pause prolonged but that singing might issue</l>
     <l n="4">thence ?</l>
     <l n="5">Why rushed the discords in but that harmony might be prized ?</l>
   </lg>
   <p>From the above discussion it should be plain that the short poem Cristina deserves patient and intense study , for it contains in the form of a dramatic lyric , some of Browning 's fundamental ideas .</p>

     <l n="2">Over the sea our galleys went ,</l>
     <l n="3">With cleaving prows in order brave</l>
     <l n="4">To a speeding wind and a bounding wave ,</l>
     <l n="5">A gallant armament :</l>
     <l n="6">Each bark built out of a forest-tree</l>
     <l n="7">Left leafy and rough as first it grew ,</l>
     <l n="8">And nailed all over the gaping sides ,</l>
     <l n="9">Within and without , with black bull-hides ,</l>
     <l n="10">Seethed in fat and suppled in flame ,</l>
     <l n="11">To bear the playful billows ’ game :</l>
     <l n="12">So , each good ship was rude to see ,</l>
     <l n="13">Rude and bare to the outward view ,</l>
     <l n="14">But each upbore a stately tent</l>
     <l n="15">Where cedar pales in scented row</l>
     <l n="16">Kept out the flakes of the dancing brine ,</l>
     <l n="17">And an awning drooped the mast below ,</l>
     <l n="18">In fold on fold of the purple fine ,</l>
     <l n="19">That neither noontide nor starshine</l>
     <l n="20">Nor moonlight cold which maketh mad ,</l>
     <l n="21">Might pierce the regal tenement .</l>
     <l n="22">When the sun dawned , oh , gay and glad</l>
     <l n="23">We set the sail and plied the oar ;</l>
     <l n="24">But when the night-wind blew like breath ,</l>
     <l n="25">For joy of one day 's voyage more ,</l>
     <l n="26">We sang together on the wide sea ,</l>
     <l n="27">Like men at peace on a peaceful shore ;</l>
     <l n="28">Each sail was loosed to the wind so free ,</l>
     <l n="29">Each helm made sure by the twilight star ,</l>
     <l n="30">And in a sleep as calm as death ,</l>
     <l n="31">We , the voyagers from afar ,</l>
     <l n="32">Lay stretched along , each weary crew</l>
     <l n="33">In a circle round its wondrous tent</l>
     <l n="34">Whence gleamed soft light and curled rich scent ,</l>
     <l n="35">And with light and perfume , music too :</l>
     <l n="36">So the stars wheeled round , and the darkness past ,</l>
     <l n="37">And at morn we started beside the mast ,</l>

     <l n="43">But the heaving sea was black behind</l>
     <l n="44">For many a night and many a day ,</l>
     <l n="45">And land , though but a rock , drew nigh ;</l>
     <l n="46">So , we broke the cedar pales away ,</l>
     <l n="47">Let the purple awning flap in the wind ,</l>
     <l n="48">And a statue bright was on every deck !</l>
     <l n="49">We shouted , every man of us ,</l>
     <l n="50">And steered right into the harbour thus ,</l>
     <l n="51">With pomp and paean glorious .</l>

     <l n="55">Nor paused till in the westering sun</l>

     <l n="58">When lo ! what shouts and merry songs !</l>
     <l n="59">What laughter all the distance stirs !</l>
     <l n="60">A loaded raft with happy throngs</l>

     <l n="67">Oh , then we awoke with sudden start</l>

     <l n="70">Which had received our precious freight :</l>

   <p>The dramatic lyric in two parts called Meeting at Night and Parting at Morning contains only sixteen lines and is a flawless masterpiece . Of the four dimensions of mathematics , one only has nothing to do with poetry . The length of a poem is of no importance in estimating its value . I do not fully understand what is meant by saying that a poem is too long or too short . It depends entirely on the art with which the particular subject is treated . A short poem of no value is too long ; a long poem of genius is not too long . Richardson 's Clarissa in eight volumes is not too long , as is proved by the fact that the numerous attempts to abridge it are all failures ; whereas many short stories in our magazines are far too long . Browning 's Night and Morning is not too short , because it contains in sixteen lines everything necessary ; The Ring and the Book is not too long , because the twenty thousand and odd lines are all needed to make the study of testimony absolutely complete . But whilst the mathematical dimension of length is not a factor in poetry , the dimensions of breadth and depth are of vital importance , and the mysterious fourth dimension is the quality that determines whether or not a poem is a work of genius . Poems of the highest imagination can not be measured at all except in the fourth dimension . The first part of Browning 's lyric is notable for its shortness , its breadth and its depth ; the second part possesses these qualities even more notably , and also takes the reader 's thoughts into a world entirely outside the limits of time and space .</p>
   <p>Browning has often been called a careless writer and although he maintained that the accusation was untrue , the condition of some of the manuscripts he sent to the press — notably Mr. Sludge , the Medium — is proof positive that he did not work at each one of his poems at his highest level of patient industry . He was however in general a fastidious artist ; much more so than is commonly supposed . He was one of our greatest impromptu poets , like Shakespeare , writing hot from the brain ; he was not a polisher and reviser , like Chaucer and Tennyson . But he studied with care the sound of his words . Many years ago , Mrs . Le Moyne , who has done so much to increase the number of intelligent Browning lovers in America , met the poet in Europe , and told him she would like to recite to him one of his own poems . “ Go ahead , my dear . ” So she began to repeat in her beautiful voice Meeting at Night ; she spoke the third line</p>
   <p>And the little startled waves that leap</p>
   <p>“ Stop ! ” said Browning , “ that is n't right . ” She then learned from him the sharp difference between “ little startled waves ” as she read it , and “ startled little waves ” as he wrote it . He was trying to produce the effect of a warm night on the beach with no wind , where the tiny wavelets simply crumble in a brittle fashion on the sand . “ Startled little waves ” produces this effect ; “ little startled waves ” does not .</p>
   <p>The impressionistic colors in this poem add much to its effect ; the grey sea , the black land , the yellow moon , the fiery ringlets , the blue spurt of the match , the golden light of morning . The sounds and smells are realistic ; one hears the boat cut harshly into the slushy sand ; the sharp scratch of the match ; one inhales the thick , heavy odor radiating from the sea-scented beach that has absorbed all day the hot rays of the sun .</p>
   <p>It is probable that the rendezvous is not at dusk , as is commonly supposed , but at midnight . Owen Wister , in his fine novel , The Virginian , speaks of the lover 's journey as taking place at dusk . Now the half-moon could not scientifically be low at that early hour , and although most poets care nothing at all for the moon except as a decorative object , Browning was generally precise in such matters . An American poet submitted to the Century Magazine a poem that was accepted , the last line of each stanza reading</p>
   <p>And in the west the waning moon hangs low .</p>
   <p>One of the editorial staff remembered that the waning moon does not hang low in the west ; he therefore changed the word to “ weary , ” which made the poet angry . He insisted that he was a poet , not a man of science , and vowed that he would place his moon exactly where he chose . The editors replied , “ You can have a waning moon in the west in some magazines , perhaps , but you can not have it there in the Century . ” So it was published “ weary , ” as any one may see who has sufficient time and patience .</p>
   <p>Furthermore the contrast in this poem is not between evening and morning , but between night and morning . The English commonly draw a distinction between evening and night that we do not observe in America . Pippa Passes is divided into four sections , Morning , Noon , Evening , Night . Furthermore the meeting is a clandestine one ; not the first one , for the man 's soliloquy of his line of march shows how often he has travelled this way before , and now his eager mind , leaping far ahead of his feet , repeats to him each stage of the journey . The cottage is shrouded in absolute darkness until the lover 's tap is heard ; then comes the sound and the sight of the match , and the sudden thrill of the mad embrace , when the wild heart-beats are louder than the love-whispers .</p>
   <p>The dramatic contrast in this poem is between the man 's feelings at night , and his mood in the morning . Both parts of the lyric , therefore , come from the man 's heart . It is absurd to suppose , as many critics seem to think , that the second part is uttered by the woman . Such a mistake could never have arisen if it had not been for the word “ him ” in the penultimate line , which does not of course , refer to the man , but to the sun . To have the woman repeat in her heart these lines not only destroys the true philosophy of life set forth in the lyric , but the last reflection ,</p>
   <p>And the need of a world of men for me</p>
   <p>would seem to make her taste rather catholic for an ideal sweetheart .</p>
   <p>The real meaning of the poem is simply this : The passionate intensity of love can not be exaggerated ; in the night 's meeting all other thoughts , duties , and pleasures are as though they were not ; but with the day comes the imperious call of life and even if the woman could be content to live forever with her lover in the lonely cottage , he could not ; he loves her honestly with fervor and sincerity , but he simply must go out into the world where men are , and take his share of the excitement and the struggle ; he would soon be absolutely miserable if marooned from life , even with the woman he loves . Those novels that represent a man as having no interest in life but love are false to human nature . In this poem Browning represents facts as they are ; it is not simply that the man wants to go out and live among other men , it is a natural law that he must , as truly a natural law as gravitation .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">And straight was a path of gold for him ,</l>
     <l n="2">And the need of a world of men for me .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Just as the sun must take his prescribed course through the sky , so must I run my circle of duties in the world of men . It is not a moral call of duty ; it is the importunate pull of necessity .</p>
   <p>There is still the possibility of another interpretation of the last line , though I think the one just given is correct , “ I need the world of men ; it is a natural law . ” Now it is just possible that we could interpret “ need ” in another sense , with an inversion ; “ the world of men needs me , and I must go to do my share . ” This would make the man perhaps nobler , but surely not so natural ; indeed it would sound like a priggish excuse to leave his mistress . I have never quite surrendered to the cavalier 's words</p>

   <p>It is impossible to improve on the Cowboy 's comment on these lines in Mr. Wister 's Virginian ; after Molly has read them aloud to the convalescing male , he remarks softly , “ That is very , very true . ” Molly does not see why the Virginian admires these verses so much more than the others . “ I could scarcely explain , ” says he , “ but that man does know something . ” Molly wants to know if the lovers had quarrelled . “ Oh , no ! he will come back after he has played some more of the game . ” “ The game ? ” “ Life , ma'am . Whatever he was adoin ’ in the world of men . That 's a bed-rock piece , ma'am . ”</p>
   <p>The Virginian is much happier in his literary criticism of this lyric than he is of the Good News or of the Incident of the French Camp ; in the latter instance , he misses the point altogether . The boy was not a poseur . The boy was so happy to think he had actually given his life for his master that he smilingly corrected Napoleon 's cry “ You 're wounded ! ” It is as though one should congratulate an athletic contestant , and say “ My felicitations ! you won the second prize ! ” “ No , indeed : I won the First . ”</p>
   <p>Night and Morning suggests so many thoughts that we could continue our comments indefinitely ; but time suffices for only one more . The nature picture of the dawn is absolutely perfect .</p>
   <p>Round the cape of a sudden came the sea .</p>
   <p>He does not say that finally the cape became visible , but that the sea suddenly came round the cape . Any one who has stood on the ocean-shore before dawn , and gazed along the indented coast in the grey light , has observed the precise effect mentioned in these words . At first one sees only the blur of land where the cape is , and nothing beyond it ; suddenly the light increases , and the sea actually appears to come around the point .</p>

   <p>It is interesting to remember that Browning , of all poets most intellectual , should be so predominantly the poet of Love . This passion is the motive power of his verse , as he believed it to be the motive power of the universe . He exhibits the love of men and women in all its manifestations , from baseness and folly to the noblest heights of self-renunciation . It is natural that the most masculine and the most vigorous and the most intellectual of all our poets should devote his powers mainly to the representation of love . For love is the essence of force , and does not spring from effeminate weakness or febrile delicacy . Any painter can cover a huge canvas , but , as has been observed , only the strong hand can do the fine and tender work . To discuss at length the love-poems of Browning would take us far beyond the limits of this volume ; but certain of the dramatic lyrics may be selected to illustrate salient characteristics . As various poets in making portraits emphasise what is to them the most expressive features , the eyes or the lips , so Browning , the poet of the mind , loves best of all in his women and men , the Brow .</p>
   <p>In Evelyn Hope ,</p>
   <p>And the sweet white brow is all of her .</p>
   <p>In The Last Ride Together ,</p>
   <p>My mistress bent that brow of hers .</p>

   <p>His ideally beautiful women generally have yellow hair . The lady In a Gondola had coiled hair , “ a round smooth cord of gold . ” In Evelyn Hope , the “ hair 's young gold : ” in Love Among the Ruins , “ eager eyes and yellow hair : ” in A Toccata ,</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Dear dead women , with such hair , too — what 's become of all the gold</l>
     <l n="2">Used to hang and brush their bosoms ?</l>
   </lg>
   <p>And we must not forget his poem , Gold Hair . His descriptions of women 's faces are never conventional , rosy cheeks and bright eyes , but always definite and specific . In Time 's Revenges , the unfortunate lover is maddened by the vision of the girl 's face :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">So is my spirit , as flesh with sin ,</l>
     <l n="2">Filled full , eaten out and in</l>
     <l n="3">With the face of her , the eyes of her ,</l>
     <l n="4">The lips , the little chin , the stir</l>
     <l n="5">Of shadow round her mouth .</l>

   <p>Browning 's rejected lovers are such splendid fellows that one wonders at their ill luck . Tennyson 's typical lovers , as seen in Locksley Hall , Lady Clara Vere de Vere , and the first part of Maud , behave in a manner that quite justifies the woman . They whine , they rave , and they seem most of all to be astonished at the woman 's lack of judgment in not recognising their merits . Instead of a noble sorrow , they exhibit peevishness ; they seem to say , “ You 'll be sorry some day . ” Browning 's rejected lovers never think of themselves and their own defeat ; they think only of the woman , who is now more adorable than ever . It never occurs to them that the woman is lacking in intelligence because of her refusal ; nor that the man she prefers is a lowbrowed scoundrel . They are chivalrous ; they do their best to win . When they lose , they would rather have been rejected by this woman than accepted by any other ; and they are always ready to congratulate the man more fortunate than they . They are in fact simply irresistible , and one can not help believing in their ultimate success . In The Lost Mistress , which Swinburne said was worth a thousand Lost Leaders , the lover has just been rejected , and instead of thinking of his own misery , he endeavours to make the awkward situation easier for the girl by small-talk about the sparrows and the leaf-buds . She has urged that their friendship continue ; that this episode need not put an end to their meetings , and that he can come to see her as often as he likes , only there must be no nonsense ; he must promise to be sensible , and treat her only as a friend . Instead of rejecting this suggestion with scorn , he accepts , and agrees to do his best .</p>

   <p>In One Way of Love , the same kind of man appears . Pauline likes flowers , music , and fine speeches . He is just a mere man , who has never noticed a flower in his life , who is totally indifferent to music , and never could talk with eloquence . But if Pauline likes these things , he must endeavor to impress her , if not with his skill , at all events with his devotion . He sends her a beautiful bouquet ; she does not even notice it . For months he tries to learn the instrument , until finally he can play “ his tune . ” She does not even listen ; he throws the lute away , for he cares nothing for music except for her sake . At last comes the supreme moment when he makes his declaration , on which the whole happiness of his life depends .</p>

    </lg>

   <p>Finally , the same kind of character appears in one of the greatest love-poems in all literature , The Last Ride Together . The situation just before the opening lines is an exact parallel to that of The Lost Mistress . Every day this young pair have been riding together . The man has fallen in love , and has mistaken the girl 's camaraderie for a deeper feeling . He has just discovered his error , and without minimising the force of the blow that has wrecked his life 's happiness , this is what he says :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Then , dearest , since ‘ tis so ,</l>
     <l n="2">Since now at length my fate I know ,</l>
     <l n="3">Since nothing all my love avails ,</l>
     <l n="4">Since all , my life seemed meant for , fails ,</l>
     <l n="5">Since this was written and needs must be —</l>
     <l n="6">My whole heart rises up to</l>
     <l n="7">( curse , oh , no ! )</l>
     <l n="8">rises up to bless</l>
     <l n="9">Your name in pride and thankfulness !</l>
     <l n="10">Take back the hope you gave ,— I claim</l>
     <l n="11">Only a memory of the same ,</l>
     <l n="12">— And this beside , if you will not blame ,</l>
     <l n="13">Your leave for one more last ride with me .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>What does the rejected lover mean by such brave words as “ pride ” and “ thankfulness ” ? He means that it is a great honor to be rejected by such a woman , as Mr. Birrell says it is better to be knocked down by Doctor Johnson than to be picked up by Mr. Froude . He is thankful , too , to have known such a wonderful woman ; and to show that he can control himself , and make the situation easier for her , he requests that to-day for the last time they ride just as usual — indeed they had met for that purpose , are properly accoutred , and were about to start , when he astonished her with his sudden and no longer controllable declaration . Right ! We shall ride together . I am not yet banished from the sight of her . Perhaps the world will end to-night .</p>
   <p>In the course of this poem , Browning develops one of his favorite ideas , that Life is always greater than Art . A famous poet may sit at his desk , and write of love in a way to thrill the hearts of his readers ; but we should place him lower than rustic sweethearts meeting in the moonlight , because they are having in reality something which exists for the poet only in dreams . The same is true of sculpture and all pictorial art ; men will turn from the greatest masterpiece of the chisel or the brush to look at a living woman .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">And you , great sculptor ,— so , you gave</l>
     <l n="2">A score of years to Art , her slave ,</l>
     <l n="3">And that 's your Venus , whence we turn</l>
     <l n="4">To yonder girl that fords the burn !</l>
   </lg>
   <p>I was once seated in the square room in the gallery at Dresden that holds the most famous picture in the world , Rafael 's Sistine Madonna . A number of tourists were in the place , and we were all gazing steadfastly at the immortal Virgin , when a pretty , fresh-colored young American girl entered the room . Every man 's head twisted away from the masterpiece of art , and every man 's eyes stared at the commonplace stranger , because she was alive ! I was much amused , and could not help thinking of Browning 's lines .</p>
   <p>This doctrine , that Life is greater than Art , is repeated by Browning in Cleon , and it forms the whole content of Ibsen 's last drama , When We Dead Awaken .</p>
   <p>The lover 's reasoning at the close of Browning 's poem , that rejection may be better for him because now he has an unrealised ideal , and that the race itself is better than the victor 's garland , reminds us of Lessing 's noble saying , that if God gave him the choice between the knowledge of all truth and the search for it , he would humbly take the latter .</p>

   <p>Browning 's lovers , as has been illustrated , are usually chivalrous , whether their passions have or have not the sanction of law . The poem In a Gondola , which has been more often translated into foreign languages than perhaps any other of Browning 's works , gives us a picture of a night in Venice . The fluent rhythms of the verse indicate the lazy glide of the gondola through the dark waters of the canal . The lovers speak , sing , and muse ; and their conversation is full of the little language characteristic of those who are in complete possession of each other , soul and body . They delight in passionate reminiscences : they love to recall their first chance meeting :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Ah , the autumn day</l>
     <l n="2">I , passing , saw you overhead !</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The wind blew out the curtains of her apartment , and her pet parrot escaped , giving the man his opportunity . They rehearse over again the advancing stages of their drama . She asks him to kiss her like a moth , then like a bee — in the attempt to recapture the first shy sweetness of their dawning passion . They play little love-games . He pretends he is a Jew , carrying her away from her family to a tribal feast ; then that they twain are spirits of stars , meeting in the thin air aloft . The intensity of their bliss is sharpened by the black cloud of danger in which they move : for if the Three , husband , father , and brother of the lady become aware of this secret liaison , there can be only one end to it — a tragedy of blood . The lighted taper held in the window by the trusted maid shows that they are “ safe , ” and for the last time they play again their little comedy of formality . She pretends to be the formal grande dame , the lady with the colder breast than snow : he is the bashful gallant , who hardly dares touch the tips of her fingers . In this laughing moment , the dagger of the husband is driven deep into his back . Like all of Browning 's lovers , he gives , even on the edge of the eternal darkness , no thought to himself , but only to her . Gathering his dying energies , he speaks in a loud tone , so that the conspirators , invisible in the Venetian night , may hear him :</p>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Care not for the cowards ! Care</l>
     <l n="2">Only to put aside thy beauteous hair</l>
     <l n="3">My blood will hurt !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="4">And in the last agony , he comforts her with the thought that all this ,</l>
     <l n="5">the joy of love and the separation by murder , have been ordained .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>In Love Among the Ruins , with which Men and Women originally opened , and which some believe to be Browning 's masterpiece , Love is given its place as the supreme fact in human history . This is a scene in the Roman Campagna at twilight , and the picture in the first stanza reminds us of Gray 's Elegy in the perfection of its quiet silver tone . With a skill nothing short of genius , Browning has maintained in this poem a double parallel . Up to the fifth stanza , the contrast is between the present peace of the vast solitary plain , and its condition years ago when it was the centre of a city 's beating heart : from the fifth stanza to the close , the contrast is between this same vanished civilisation and the eternal quality of Love . I do not remember any other work in literature where a double parallel is given with such perfect continuity and beauty ; the first half of each stanza is in exact antithesis to the last . The parenthesis — so they say — is a delicate touch of dramatic irony . No one would dream that this quiet plain was once the site of a great city , for no proofs remain : we have to take the word of the archæologists for it . Some day a Japanese shepherd may pasture his sheep on Manhattan Island .</p>
   <p>After a poetic discourse on the text Sic transit gloria mundi — the love motive is suddenly introduced in the fifth stanza ; and now the contrast changes , and becomes a comparison between the ephemeral nature of civilisation and the permanent fact of Love . At the exact spot where the grandstand formerly stood at the finish of the horse-race , where the King , surrounded by courtiers , watched the whirling chariots , now remains motionless , breathless , a yellow-haired girl . The proud King 's eyes looked over the stadium and beheld the domes and pinnacles of his city , the last word of civilisation ; the girl 's eager eyes look over the silent plain searching for the coming of her lover . And Browning would have us believe that this latter fact is far more important historically than the former .</p>
   <p>Suppose an American professor of archæology is working on the grassy expanse , collecting material for his new book ; he looks up for a moment and sees a pair of rustic lovers kissing in the twilight ; he smiles , and resumes what seems to him his important labor . Little does he imagine that this love-scene is more significant than all the broken bits of pottery he digs out of the ground ; yet such is the fact . For all he can do at his very best is to reconstruct a vanished past , while the lovers are acting a scene that belongs to eternity . Love is best .</p>

   <p>In the poem Respectability Browning gives us a more vulgar , but none the less vital aspect of love . This is no peaceful twilit harmony ; this scene is set on a windy , rainy night in noisy Paris , on the left bank of the Seine , directly in front of the Institute of France . Two reckless lovers — either old comrades or picked-up acquaintances of this very night , it matters not which — come tripping along gaily , arm in arm . The man chaffs at worldly conventions , at the dullness of society , at the hypocrisy of so-called respectable people , and congratulates himself and his fair companion on the fun they are having . What fools they would have been had they waited through a long , formal courtship for the sanction of an expensive marriage ! The world , he says , does not forbid kisses , only it says , you must see the magistrate first . My finger must not touch your soft lips until it is covered with the glove of marriage . Bah ! what do we care for the world 's good word ? At this moment they reach the lighted windows of the Institute , and like a pair of sparrows , they glance within at the highly proper but terribly tedious company . What do they see ? They see Guizot compelled by political exigency to shake hands hypocritically with his enemy Montalembert . But before them down a dim court shine three lamps , an all-night dance resort . Come on ! run for it ! that 's the place for us ! no dull formalities , no hypocrisies there ! Something doing !</p>

   <p>In the list of Dramatis Personae , Browning placed Confessions shortly after A Death in the Desert , as if to show the enormous contrast in two death-bed scenes . After a presentation of the last noble , spiritual , inspired moments of the apostle John , we have portrayed for us the dying delirium of an old sinner , whose thought travels back to the sweetest moments of his life , his clandestine meetings with the girl he loved . The solemn voice of the priest is like the troublesome buzzing of a fly .</p>
   <p>Do I view the world as a vale of tears ?</p>
   <p>Not much !</p>
   <p>Like Matthew Arnold 's Wish , the brother-doctor of the soul who is called in</p>
   <p>To canvass with official breath</p>
   <p>is simply a nuisance in these last minutes of life . The row of medicine bottles , all useless now for practical purposes , represents to his fevered eyes the topography of the scene where the girl used to come running to meet him . “ I know , sir , it 's improper , ” — I ought not to talk this way to a clergyman , my mind is n't right , I 'm dying , and this is all I can think of .</p>

   <p>We may close our considerations of the dramatic lyrics with three love-poems . Whenever in his later years Browning was asked to write a selection with his autograph , he used to say playfully that the only one of his poems that he could remember was My Star ; hence more copies of this exist in manuscript than any other of his productions . It was of course a tribute to his wife ; she shone upon his life like a star of various colors ; but the moment the world attempted to pry into the secret of her genius , she shut off the light altogether . Let the world regard Saturn , the most wonderful star in the heavens . My star shines for me alone .</p>
   <p>The first and best of the series of Bad Dreams gives us again in Browning 's last volume his doctrine of love . Love is its own reward : it may be sad not to have love returned , but the one unspeakable tragedy is to lose the capacity for loving . In a terrible dream , the face of the woman changes from its familiar tenderness to a glance of stony indifference , and in response to his agonised enquiry , she declares that her love for him is absolutely dead . Then comes a twofold bliss : one was in the mere waking from such desolation , but the other consisted in the fact that even if the dream were true , his love for her knew no diminution . Thank God , I loved on the same !</p>
   <p>The most audacious poem of Browning 's old age is Summum Bonum . Since the dawn of human speculative thought , philosophers have asked this question , What is the highest good ? It has been answered in various ways . Omar Khayyam said it was Wine : John Stuart Mill said it was the greatest happiness of the greatest number : the Westminster Catechism said it was to glorify God and enjoy Him forever . Browning says it is the kiss of one girl . This kiss is the concentrated essence of all the glory , beauty , and sweetness of life . In order to understand such a paradox , we must remember that in Browning 's philosophy , Love is the engine of the whole universe . I have no doubt that Love meant to him more than it has ever meant to any other poet or thinker ; just as I am sure that the word Beauty revealed to Keats a vision entirely beyond the range of even the greatest seers . Love is the supreme fact ; and every manifestation of it on earth , from the Divine Incarnation down to a chance meeting of lovers , is more important than any other event or idea . Now we have seen that it is Browning 's way invariably to represent an abstract thought by a concrete illustration . Therefore in this great and daring lyric we find the imaginary lover calling the kiss of the woman he loves the highest good in life .</p>

   <p>DRAMATIC MONOLOGUES</p>
   <p>Although Browning was not a failure as a dramatist — A Blot in the ‘ Scutcheon and In a Balcony are the greatest verse tragedies in the language since the Elizabethans — he found the true channel for his genius in the Dramatic Monologue . He takes a certain critical moment in one person 's life , and by permitting the individual to speak , his character , the whole course of his existence , and sometimes the spirit of an entire period in the world 's history are revealed in a brilliant searchlight . With very few exceptions , one of which will be given in our selections , a dramatic monologue is not a meditation nor a soliloquy ; it is a series of remarks , usually confessional , addressed either orally or in an epistolary form to another person or to a group of listeners . These other figures , though they do not speak , are necessary to the understanding of the monologue ; we often see them plainly , and see their faces change in expression as the monologue advances . At the dinner table of Bishop Blougram , the little man Gigadibs is conspicuously there ; and Lucrezia is so vividly before us in Andrea del Sarto , that a clever actress has actually assumed this silent rôle on the stage , and exhibited simply by her countenance the effect of Andrea 's monologue . This species of verse is perhaps the highest form of poetic art , as it is the most difficult ; for with no stage setting , no descriptions , no breaks in the conversation , the depths of the human heart are exposed .</p>
   <p>One of the greatest dramatic monologues in all literature is My Last Duchess , and it is astounding that so profound a life-drama should have been conceived and faultlessly expressed by so young a poet . The whole poem contains only fifty-six lines , but it could easily be expanded into a three-volume novel . Indeed it exhibits Browning 's genius for condensation as impressively as The Ring and the Book proves his genius for expansion . The metre is interesting . It is the heroic couplet , the same form exactly in which Pope wrote his major productions . Yet the rime , which is as evident as the recurring strokes of a tack-hammer in Pope , is scarcely heard at all in My Last Duchess . Its effect is so muffled , go concealed , that I venture to say that many who are quite familiar with the poem , could not declare offhand whether it were written in rime or in blank verse . This technical trick is accomplished by what the French call overflow , the running on of the sense from one line to another , a device so dear to the heart of Milton . Some one has well said that Dryden 's couplets are links in a chain , whilst Pope 's are pearls on a string . Pope enclosed nearly every couplet , so that they are quite separate , which is one reason why he has given us such a vast number of aphorisms . To see how totally different in effect the heroic couplet is when it is closed and when it is open , one may compare almost any selection from Pope with the opening lines of Keats 's Endymion , and then silently marvel that both poems are written in exactly the same measure .</p>

     <l n="1">A thing of beauty is a joy forever :</l>
     <l n="2">Its loveliness increases ; it will never</l>
     <l n="3">Pass into nothingness ; but still will keep</l>

     <l n="5">Full of sweet dreams , and health , and quiet breathing .</l>
     <l n="6">Therefore , on every morrow , are we wreathing</l>
     <l n="7">A flowery band to bind us to the earth .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>One has only to glance at the printed page of My Last Duchess , and see how few of the lines end in punctuation points , to discover the method employed when a poet wishes to write a very strict measure in a very free manner .</p>
   <p>I have sometimes thought that George Eliot took a hint from this poem in the composition of Daniel Deronda , for the relations between Grandcourt and Gwendolen are exactly the same as existed between the Duke and his late wife ; a more recent , though not so great an example , may be found in Mrs. Burnett 's novel , The Shuttle . The poem is a study in cold , systematic torture of a warm human soul by an icy-hearted tyrant .</p>
   <p>Browning adopts one of his favorite methods of character-revelation here . All that we know of the Duchess is the testimony given by her worst enemy , her husband ; and yet , in attempting to describe her , he has succeeded in painting only his own narrow and hideous heart . Slander is often greater in the recoil than in the discharge ; when a man attempts to give an unfavorable portrait of another , he usually gives us an exact likeness of himself . Pope meant his picture of Addison to be correct ; but although he made the picture with immortal art , it is no more like Addison than it resembles St. Francis ; it is , however , an absolutely faithful image of Pope himself . This is one reason why slander is such an exceedingly dangerous weapon to handle .</p>
   <p>The Duke tells the envoy that his late Duchess was flirtatious , plebeian in her enthusiasm , not sufficiently careful to please her husband ; but the evident truth is that he had a Satanic pride , that he was yellow with jealousy , that he was methodically cruel . His jealousy is shown by the fact that he would allow only a monk to paint her : “ I said ‘ Frà Pandolf ’ by design , ” and he required the monk to do the whole task in one day . His pride is shown in the fact that although her expansive nature displeased him , he would never stoop to remonstrate with her . His cruelty is shown in the fact that he coldly repressed her little enthusiasms , and finally murdered her . I suppose she was really a frank , charming girl , who came from a happy home , a bright and eager bride ; she was one of those lovely women whose kindness and responsiveness are as natural as the sunlight . She loved to watch the sunset from the terrace ; she loved to pet the white mule ; she was delighted when some one brought her a gift of cherries . Then she was puzzled , bewildered , when she found that all her expressions of delight in life received a cold , disapproving glance of scorn from her husband ; her lively talk at dinner , her return from a ride , flushed and eager , met invariably this icy stare of hatred . She smiled too much to please him .</p>
   <p>Then all smiles stopped together .</p>
   <p>What difference does it make whether he deliberately poisoned her , or whether he simply broke her heart by the daily chill of silent contempt ? For her , at all events , death must have been a release . She would have been happier with a drunken husband , with a brute who kicked her , rather than with this supercilious cold-hearted patrician . Toward the end of the poem , in his remarks about the dowry , we see that the Duke is as avaricious as he is cruel ; though he says with a disagreeable smile , that the woman herself is his real object . The touch to make this terrible man complete comes at the very end . The Duke and the envoy prepare to descend the staircase ; the latter bows , to give precedence to the man with the nine hundred years ’ old name : but the Duke , with a purr like a tiger , places his arm around the shoulder of the visitor , and they take the first step . Just then the master of the palace calls attention casually to a group of statuary . It is Neptune taming a sea-horse . That 's the way I break them in !</p>
   <p>Throughout the whole monologue , the Duke speaks in a quiet , steady , ironical tone ; the line</p>
   <p>The depth and passion of its earnest glance</p>
   <p>is pronounced in intense irony , in ridicule of the conventional remark made by previous visitors . Only once or twice do we see the teeth of this monster flash , revealing his horrible heart . When he speaks of the “ officious fool ” who brought the cherries , and when he says “ all smiles stopped together ” ; then the envoy looks at him with a fearful question in his eyes , but the Duke 's face immediately resumes its mask of stone .</p>

     <l n="5">Worked busily a day , and there she stands .</l>

     <l n="16">Of joy into the Duchess ’ cheek : perhaps</l>
     <l n="17">Frà Pandolf chanced to say “ Her mantle laps</l>

     <l n="19">Must never hope to reproduce the faint</l>
     <l n="20">Half-flush that dies along her throat : ” such stuff</l>
     <l n="21">Was courtesy , she thought , and cause enough</l>
     <l n="22">For calling up that spot of joy . She had</l>
     <l n="23">A heart — how shall I say ?— too soon made glad ,</l>
     <l n="24">Too easily impressed ; she liked whate'er</l>

     <l n="27">The dropping of the daylight in the West ,</l>
     <l n="28">The bough of cherries some officious fool</l>
     <l n="29">Broke in the orchard for her , the white mule</l>
     <l n="30">She rode with round the terrace — all and each</l>
     <l n="31">Would draw from her alike the approving speech ,</l>
     <l n="32">Or blush , at least . She thanked men ,— good ! but thanked</l>
     <l n="33">Somehow — I know not how — as if she ranked</l>
     <l n="34">My gift of a nine-hundred-years-old name</l>
     <l n="35">With anybody 's gift . Who 'd stoop to blame</l>
     <l n="36">This sort of trifling ? Even had you skill</l>
     <l n="37">In speech — ( which I have not ) — to make your will</l>
     <l n="38">Quite clear to such an one , and say , “ Just this</l>
     <l n="39">Or that in you disgusts me ; here you miss ,</l>
     <l n="40">Or there exceed the mark ” — and if she let</l>
     <l n="41">Herself be lessoned so , nor plainly set</l>
     <l n="42">Her wits to yours , forsooth , and made excuse ,</l>
     <l n="43">— E'en then would be some stooping ; and I choose</l>
     <l n="44">Never to stoop . Oh sir , she smiled , no doubt ,</l>
     <l n="45">Whene'er I passed her ; but who passed without</l>
     <l n="46">Much the same smile ? This grew ; I gave commands ;</l>
     <l n="47">Then all smiles stopped together . There she stands</l>
     <l n="48">As if alive . Will't please you rise ? We 'll meet</l>
     <l n="49">The company below , then . I repeat ,</l>
     <l n="50">The Count your master 's known munificence</l>
     <l n="51">Is ample warrant that no just pretence</l>
     <l n="52">Of mine for dowry will be disallowed ;</l>
     <l n="53">Though his fair daughter 's self , as I avowed</l>
     <l n="54">At starting , is my object . Nay , we 'll go</l>
     <l n="55">Together down , sir . Notice Neptune , though ,</l>
     <l n="56">Taming a sea-horse , thought a rarity ,</l>
     <l n="57">Which Claus of Innsbruck cast in bronze for me !</l>

   </lg>
   <p>To turn from My Last Duchess to Count Gismond is like coming out of a damp cellar into God 's own sunshine . Originally Browning called these two poems Italy and France ; but he later fell madly in love with Italy , and I suppose could not bear to have so cold-blooded a tragedy represent the country graven on his heart . The charm and brightness of Count Gismond are properly connected with one of the loveliest towns in the world , the old city of Aix in Provence , a jewel on the hills rising from the Mediterranean Sea .</p>
   <p>Gismond is Browning 's hero . He is the resolute man who does not hesitate , who makes himself instantly master of the situation , who appears like Lohengrin in the moment of Elsa 's sharp distress , a messenger from Heaven .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Or , if virtue feeble were ,</l>
     <l n="2">Heaven itself would stoop to her .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>When the lady was publicly accused by the scoundrel Gauthier , I suppose many men said , “ What a pity that so fair a woman should be so foul ! ” Others said gravely , “ This matter ought to be judicially examined . ” Gismond was the only man who realised that a defenseless orphan was insulted , and the words were hardly out of Gauthier 's mouth when he received “ the fist 's reply to the filth . ” The lovers walked away from the “ shouting multitude , ” the fickle , cowardly , contemptible public , who did not dare to defend the lady in her need , but had lungs enough for the victor , whoever he might be . It is pleasant to notice the prayer of the lady for the dead Gauthier . “ I hope his soul is in heaven . ” This is no mere Christian forgiveness . Gauthier had proved to be the means of her life-happiness . Had it not been for his shameful accusation , she would never have met Gismond . Out of her agony came her richest blessing .</p>
   <p>All this happened years ago , but when her husband appears with the children she tells him a white lie . “ I have just been boasting to Adela about the skill of my hunting hawk . ” She has been doing nothing of the kind ; but she can not talk about the great event of her life before the children .</p>

   <p>The Soliloquy of the Spanish Cloister differs from most of the Dramatic Monologues in not being addressed to a listener ; but the difference is more apparent than real ; for the other person is in plain view all the time , and the Soliloquy would have no point were it not for the peaceful activities of Friar Lawrence . This poem , while it deals ostensibly with the lives of only two monks , gives us a glimpse into the whole monastic system . When a number of men retired into a monastery and shut out the world forever , certain sins and ambitions were annihilated , while others were enormously magnified . All outside interests vanished ; but sin remained , for it circulates in the human heart as naturally as blood in the body . The cloister was simply a little world , with the nobleness and meanness of human nature exceedingly conspicuous . When the men were once enclosed in the cloister walls , they knew that they must live in that circumscribed spot till the separation of death . Naturally therefore political ambitions , affections , envies , jealousies , would be writ large ; human nature would display itself in a manner most interesting to a student , if only he could live there in a detached way . This is just what Browning tries to do ; he tries to live imaginatively with the monks , and to practise his profession as the Chronicler of Life .</p>
   <p>The only way to realise what the monastic life really meant would be to imagine a small modern college situated in the country , and the passage of a decree that not a single student should leave the college grounds until his body was committed to the tomb . The outside interests of the world would quickly grow dim and eventually vanish ; and everything would be concentrated within the community . I suppose that the passions of friendship , hatred , and jealousy would be prodigiously magnified . There must have been friendships among the monks of the middle ages compared to which our boasted college friendships are thin and pale ; and there must have been frightful hatreds and jealousies . In all communities there are certain persons that get on the nerves of certain others ; the only way to avoid this acute suffering is to avoid meeting the person who causes it . But imagine a cloister where dwells a. man you simply can not endure : every word he says , every motion he makes , every single mannerism of walk and speech is intolerable . Now you must live with this man until one of you dies : you must sit opposite to him at meals , you can not escape constant contact . Your only resource is profane soliloquies : but if you have a sufficiently ugly disposition , you can revenge yourself upon him in a thousand secret ways .</p>
   <p>Friar Lawrence unconsciously and innocently fans the flames of hatred in our speaker 's heart , simply because he does not dream of the effect he produces . Every time he talks at table about the weather , the cork-crop , Latin names , and other trivialities , the man sitting opposite to him would like to dash his plate in his face : every time Friar Lawrence potters around among his roses , the other looking down from his window , with a face distorted with hate , would like to kill him with a glance . Poor Lawrence drives our soliloquist mad with his deliberate table manners , with his deliberate method of speech , with his care about his own goblet and spoon . And all the time Lawrence believes that his enemy loves him !</p>
   <p>From another point of view , this poem resembles My Last Duchess in that it is a revelation of the speaker 's heart . We know nothing about Friar Lawrence except what his deadly enemy tells us ; but it is quite clear that Lawrence is a dear old man , innocent as a child ; while the speaker , simply in giving his testimony against him , reveals a heart jealous , malicious , lustful ; he is like a thoroughly bad boy at school , with a pornographic book carefully concealed . Just at the moment when his rage and hatred reach a climax , the vesper bell sounds ; and the speaker , who is an intensely strict formalist and ritualist , presents to us an amusing spectacle ; for out of the same mouth proceed blessing and cursing .</p>

   <p>Everybody loves Browning 's Ghent to Aix poem . Even those who can not abide the poet make an exception here ; and your thorough-going Browningite never outgrows this piece . It is the greatest horseback poem in the literature of the world : compared to this , Paul Revere 's Ride is the amble of a splayfooted nag . It sounds as though it had been written in the saddle : but it was really composed during a hot day on the deck of a vessel in the Mediterranean , and written off on the flyleaf of a printed book that the poet held in his hand . Poets are always most present with the distant , as Mrs. Browning said ; and Browning , while at sea , thought with irresistible longing of his good horse eating his head off in the stable at home . Everything about this poem is imaginary ; there never had been any such good news brought , and it is probable that no horse could cover the distance in that time .</p>
   <p>But the magnificent gallop of the verse : the change from moonset to sunrise : the scenery rushing by : the splendid spirit of horse and man : and the almost insane joy of the rider as he enters Aix — these are more true than history itself . Browning is one of our greatest poets of motion — whether it be the glide of a gondola , the swift running of the Marathon professional Pheidippides , the steady advance of the galleys over the sea in Paracelsus , the sharp staccato strokes of the horse 's hoofs through the Metidja , or the swinging stride of the students as they carry the dead grammarian up the mountain . Not only do the words themselves express the sound of movement ; but the thought , in all these great poems of motion , travels steadily and naturally with the advance . It is interesting to compare a madly-rushing poem like Ghent to Aix with the absolute calm of Andrea del Sarto . It gives one an appreciation of Browning 's purely technical skill .</p>
   <p>No one has ever , so far as I know , criticised Ghent to Aix adversely except Owen Wister 's Virginian ; and his strictures are hypercritical . As Roland threw his head back fiercely to scatter the spume-flakes , it would be easy enough for the rider to see the eye-sockets and the bloodfull nostrils . Every one has noticed how a horse will do the ear-shift , putting one ear forward and one back at the same moment . Browning has an imaginative reason for it . One ear is pushed forward to listen for danger ahead ; the other bent back , to catch his master 's voice . Was there ever a greater study in passionate cooperation between man and beast than this splendid poem ?</p>

    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="25">And his low head and crest , just one sharp ear bent back</l>

     <l n="27">And one eye 's black intelligence ,— ever that glance</l>
     <l n="28">O'er its white edge at me , his own master , askance !</l>
     <l n="29">And the thick heavy spume-flakes which aye and anon</l>

   <p>The monologue of the dying Bishop is as great a masterpiece as My Last Duchess ; it has not a superfluous word , and in only a few lines gives us the spirit of the Italian Renaissance . Ruskin said that Browning is “ unerring in every sentence he writes about the Middle Ages , always vital , right , and profound . ” He added , “ I know no other piece of modern English , prose or poetry , in which there is so much told , as in these lines , of the Renaissance spirit . ” Yet Browning had never seen Rome until a few months before this poem was published . It is an example , not of careful study , but of the inexplicable divination of genius . Browning permits a delirious old Bishop to talk a few lines , and a whole period of history is written .</p>
   <p>The church of Saint Prassede is in a dirty little alley in Rome , hard by the great church of Saint Maria Maggiore . You push through the group of filthy , importunate beggars , open a leather door , and you drop from the twentieth to the sixteenth century . It is one of the most ornate churches in Rome ; the mosaic angels in the choir are precisely as the poet describes them . The tomb of the imaginary Gandolf may be identified with a Bishop 's tomb on the south side of the church , and the Latin inscription under it , while it does not contain the form “ elucescebat , ” is not pure Tully , but rather belongs to the Latin of Ulpian 's time . The recumbent figure is in exact accord with the description by Browning .</p>
   <p>Skeptics are essential to the welfare of the Church ; it is only in periods of sharp , skilful hostility that the Church becomes pure . In the Middle Ages , when it ran riot with power , there were plenty of churchmen as corrupt as our dying man . His love for a Greek manuscript is as sensual as his love for his mistress ; and having lived a life of physical delight , it is natural that his last thoughts should concern themselves with the abode of his body rather than with the destination of his soul . Of course his mind is wandering , or he would not speak with quite such shameless cynicism . Browning has made him talk of Saint Praxed at his sermon on the mount , in order to prove the delirium . S. Praxed was a female saint .</p>
   <p>The constant confusion of Greek mythology with the ritual of the Christian church is a characteristic feature both of this poem and of the period of history it represents .</p>
   <p>Kipling is particularly fond of this work , and it will be remembered what use he makes of it in Stalky and Co .</p>

     <l n="2">Vanity , saith the preacher , vanity !</l>
     <l n="3">Draw round my bed : is Anselm keeping back ?</l>
     <l n="4">Nephews — sons mine ... ah God , I know not ! Well —</l>
     <l n="5">She , men would have to be your mother once ,</l>
     <l n="6">Old Gandolf envied me , so fair she was !</l>
     <l n="7">What 's done is done , and she is dead beside ,</l>
     <l n="8">Dead long ago , and I am Bishop since ,</l>
     <l n="9">And as she died so must we die ourselves ,</l>
     <l n="10">And thence ye may perceive the world 's a dream .</l>
     <l n="11">Life , how and what is it ? As here I lie</l>
     <l n="12">In this state-chamber , dying by degrees ,</l>
     <l n="13">Hours and long hours in the dead night , I ask</l>
     <l n="14">“ Do I live , am I dead ? ” Peace , peace seems all .</l>
     <l n="15">Saint Praxed 's ever was the church for peace ;</l>
     <l n="16">And so , about this tomb of mine . I fought</l>
     <l n="17">With tooth and nail to save my niche , ye know :</l>
     <l n="18">— Old Gandolf cozened me , despite my care ;</l>
     <l n="19">Shrewd was that snatch from out the corner South</l>
     <l n="20">He graced his carrion with , God curse the same !</l>
     <l n="21">Yet still my niche is not so cramped but thence</l>
     <l n="22">One sees the pulpit o ’ the epistle-side ,</l>
     <l n="23">And somewhat of the choir , those silent seats ,</l>
     <l n="24">And up into the aery dome where live</l>
     <l n="25">The angels , and a sunbeam 's sure to lurk :</l>
     <l n="26">And I shall fill my slab of basalt there ,</l>
     <l n="27">And ‘ neath my tabernacle take my rest ,</l>
     <l n="28">With those nine columns round me , two and two ,</l>
     <l n="29">The odd one at my feet where Anselm stands :</l>
     <l n="30">Peach-blossom marble all , the rare , the ripe</l>
     <l n="31">As fresh-poured red wine of a mighty pulse .</l>
     <l n="32">— Old Gandolf with his paltry onion-stone ,</l>
     <l n="33">Put me where I may look at him ! True peach ,</l>
     <l n="34">Rosy and flawless : how I earned the prize !</l>
     <l n="35">Draw close : that conflagration of my church</l>
     <l n="36">— What then ? So much was saved if aught were missed !</l>
     <l n="37">My sons , ye would not be my death ? Go dig</l>
     <l n="38">The white-grape vineyard where the oil-press stood ,</l>
     <l n="39">Drop water gently till the surface sink ,</l>
     <l n="40">And if ye find ... Ah God , I know not , I ! ...</l>
     <l n="41">Bedded in store of rotten fig-leaves soft ,</l>
     <l n="42">And corded up in a tight olive-frail ,</l>
     <l n="43">Some lump , ah God , of lapis lazuli ,</l>
     <l n="44">Big as a Jew 's head cut off at the nape ,</l>
     <l n="45">Blue as a vein o'er the Madonna 's breast ...</l>
     <l n="46">Sons , all have I bequeathed you , villas , all ,</l>
     <l n="47">That brave Frascati villa with its bath ,</l>
     <l n="48">So , let the blue lump poise between my knees ,</l>
     <l n="49">Like God the Father 's globe on both his hands</l>
     <l n="50">Ye worship in the Jesu Church so gay ,</l>
     <l n="51">For Gandolf shall not choose but see and burst !</l>
     <l n="52">Swift as a weaver 's shuttle fleet our years :</l>
     <l n="53">Man goeth to the grave , and where is he ?</l>
     <l n="54">Did I say basalt for my slab , sons ? Black —</l>
     <l n="55">‘ Twas ever antique-black I meant ! How else</l>
     <l n="56">Shall ye contrast my frieze to come beneath ?</l>
     <l n="57">The bas-relief in bronze ye promised me ,</l>
     <l n="58">Those Pans and Nymphs ye wot of , and perchance</l>
     <l n="59">Some tripod , thyrsus , with a vase or so ,</l>
     <l n="60">The Saviour at his sermon on the mount ,</l>
     <l n="61">Saint Praxed in a glory , and one Pan</l>
     <l n="62">Ready to twitch the Nymph 's last garment off ,</l>
     <l n="63">And Moses with the tables ... but I know</l>
     <l n="64">Ye mark me not ! What do they whisper thee ,</l>
     <l n="65">Child of my bowels , Anselm ? Ah , ye hope</l>
     <l n="66">To revel down my villas while I gasp</l>
     <l n="67">Bricked o'er with beggar 's mouldy travertine</l>
     <l n="68">Which Gandolf from his tomb-top chuckles at !</l>
     <l n="69">Nay , boys , ye love me — all of jasper , then !</l>
     <l n="70">Tis jasper ye stand pledged to , lest I grieve .</l>
     <l n="71">My bath must needs be left behind , alas !</l>
     <l n="72">One block , pure green as a pistachio-nut ,</l>
     <l n="73">There 's plenty jasper somewhere in the world —</l>
     <l n="74">And have I not Saint Praxed 's ear to pray</l>
     <l n="75">Horses for ye , and brown Greek manuscripts ,</l>
     <l n="76">And mistresses with great smooth marbly limbs ?</l>
     <l n="77">— That 's if ye carve my epitaph aright ,</l>
     <l n="78">Choice Latin , picked phrase , Tully 's every word ,</l>
     <l n="79">No gaudy ware like Gandolf 's second line —</l>
     <l n="80">Tully , my masters ? Ulpian serves his need !</l>
     <l n="81">And then how I shall lie through centuries ,</l>
     <l n="82">And hear the blessed mutter of the mass ,</l>
     <l n="83">And see God made and eaten all day long ,</l>
     <l n="84">And feel the steady candle-flame , and taste</l>
     <l n="85">Good strong thick stupefying incense-smoke !</l>
     <l n="86">For as I lie here , hours of the dead night ,</l>
     <l n="87">Dying in state and by such slow degrees ,</l>
     <l n="88">I fold my arms as if they clasped a crook ,</l>
     <l n="89">And stretch my feet forth straight as stone can point ,</l>
     <l n="90">And let the bedclothes , for a mortcloth , drop</l>
     <l n="91">Into great laps and folds of sculptor'shYpppHeNwork :</l>

     <l n="111">That in his struggle throws the thyrsus down ,</l>
     <l n="112">To comfort me on my entablature</l>
     <l n="113">Whereon I am to lie till I must ask</l>

     <l n="119">And no more lapis to delight the world !</l>
     <l n="120">Well go ! I bless ye . Fewer tapers there ,</l>

   <p>Browning gives us a terrible study of jealousy in The Laboratory . The chemist says nothing , but the contrast between the placid face of the old scientist , intent only upon his work , and the wildly passionate countenance of the little woman with him , is sufficiently impressive . Those were the days when murder was a fine art . She plans the public death of the woman she hates so that the lover will never be able to forget the dying face . Radiant in queenly beauty , with the smile of satisfaction that accompanies the inner assurance of beauty and power — in a moment she will be convulsively rolling on the floor , her swollen face purplish-black with the poison , her mouth emitting foam like a mad dog . There is no doubt that the little murderess intends to follow her rival to the tomb . She has given the chemist her entire fortune as pay for the drop of poison ; he may kiss her , if he likes ! All shame , all womanly reserve are gone : what does anything matter now ? It is a true study of jealousy , because the little creature does not dream of attacking the man who deserted her ; all her hellish energy is directed against the woman . Indeed the poison that she buys will not transform her rival more completely than the dreadful poison of jealousy has already transformed her from what she was to what she is .</p>
   <p>The language and metre fit the thought . Tennyson passed a severe judgment on the first line</p>
   <p>Now that I , tying thy glass mask tightly</p>
   <p>saying that it lacked smoothness , that it was a very difficult mouthful . But is this not intentional and absolutely right ? The woman is speaking slowly with compressed lips , her voice convulsed with terrible hatred and the terrible resolution for revenge .</p>

   <p>Fra Lippo Lippi and Andrea del Sarto are both great art poems , and both in striking contrast . The former is dynamic , the latter static . The tumultuous vivacity of the gamin who became a painter contrasts finely with the great technician , a fellow almost damned in a fair wife . Fra Lippo Lippi was a street mucker , like Gavroche ; he unconsciously learned to paint portraits by the absolute necessity of studying human faces on the street . Nothing sharpens observation like this . He had to be able to tell at a glance whether the man he accosted would give him food or a kick . When they took him to the cloister , he obtained a quite new idea about religion . He naturally judged that , as he judged everything else in life , from the practical point of view . Heretofore , like many small boys , he had rather despised religion , and thought the monks were fools . “ Do n't you believe it , ” he cries : “ there is a lot in religion . You get free clothes , free shelter , three meals a day , and you do n't have to work ! Why , it 's the easiest thing I know . ” The monks discovered his talent with pencil and brush , and they made him decorate the chapel . When the work was done , he called them in . To their amazement and horror , the saints and angels , instead of being ideal faces , were the living portraits of the familiar figures about the cloister . “ Why , there 's the iceman ! there 's the laundress ! ” He rebelled when they told him this was wicked : he said it was all a part of God 's world , that the business of the artist was to interpret life ; he wished they would let him enter the pulpit , take the Prior 's place , and preach a sermon that would make them all sit up .</p>
   <p>The philosophy of æsthetics has never been more truly or more succinctly stated than in these lines :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Or say there 's beauty with no soul at all —</l>
     <l n="2">( I never saw it — put the case the same —)</l>
     <l n="3">If you get simple beauty and nought else ,</l>
     <l n="4">You get about the best thing God invents :</l>
     <l n="5">That 's somewhat : and you 'll find the soul you have missed ,</l>
     <l n="6">Within yourself , when you return him thanks .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Contemplation of beautiful objects in nature , art , and literature , which perhaps at first sight have no significance , gradually awakens in our own hearts a dawning sense of what Beauty may mean ; and thus enlarges and develops our minds , and makes them susceptible to the wonder and glory of life . The relation of art to life — art being the teacher that makes us understand life — is perfectly well understood by Fra Lippo Lippi .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">For , do n't you mark ? we 're made so that we love</l>
     <l n="2">First when we see them painted , things we have passed</l>
     <l n="3">Perhaps a hundred times nor cared to see .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>If one stands to-day in the Ancient and Modern Gallery in Florence , and contemplates Fra Lippo Lippi 's masterpiece , The Coronation of the Virgin , and reads the lines about it in this poem , one will get a new idea of the picture . It is a representation of the painter 's whole nature , half genius , half mucker — the painting is a glory of form and color , and then in the corner the artist had the assurance to place himself in his monk 's dress among the saints and angels , where he looks as much out of place as a Bowery Boy in a Fifth Avenue drawing-room . Not content with putting himself in the picture , he stuck a Latin tag on himself , which means , “ This fellow did the job . ”</p>
   <p>Browning loves Fra Lippo Lippi , in spite of the man 's impudence and debauchery ; because the painter loved life , had a tremendous zest for it , and was not ashamed of his enthusiasm . The words he speaks came from the poet 's own heart :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">The world and life 's too big to pass for a dream ....</l>
     <l n="2">It makes me mad to see what men shall do</l>
     <l n="3">And we in our graves ! This world 's no blot for us ,</l>
     <l n="4">Nor blank ; it means intensely , and means good :</l>
     <l n="5">To find its meaning is my meat and drink .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The change from Fra Lippo Lippi to Andrea del Sarto is the change from a blustering March day to a mild autumn twilight . The original picture in Florence which inspired the poem represents Andrea and his wife sitting together , while she is holding the letter from King Francis . This is a poem of acquiescence , as the other is a poem of protest , and never was language more fittingly adapted to the mood in each instance . One can usually recognise Andrea 's pictures clear across the gallery rooms ; he has enveloped them all in a silver-grey gossamer mist , and in some extraordinary manner Browning has contrived to clothe his poem in the same diaphanous garment . It is a poem of twilight , of calm , of failure in success . Andrea 's pictures are superior technically to those of his great contemporaries — Rafael , Michel Angelo , Leonardo da Vinci — but their imperfect works have a celestial glory , the glory of aspiration , absent from his perfect productions . His work indeed is ,</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Faultily faultless , icily regular , splendidly null ,</l>
     <l n="2">Dead perfection , no more .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>It is natural , that he , whose paintings show perfection of form without spirit , should have married a woman of physical beauty devoid of soul . She has ruined him , but she could not have ruined him had he been a different man . He understands her , however , in the quiet light of his own failure . He tells her she must not treat him so badly that he can not paint at all ; and adds the necessary explanation that his ceasing to paint would stop her supplies of cash . For although it is incomprehensible to her , people are willing to give large sums of money for her ridiculous husband 's ridiculous daubs . His mind , sensitive to beauty , is drunk with his wife 's loveliness of face and form ; and like all confirmed drunkards , he can not conquer himself now , though otherwise he knows it means death and damnation . He has a complete knowledge of the whole range of his powers , and of his limitations . He can not help feeling pride in his marvellous technique , that he can do what other men dream of doing ; but he knows that without aspiration the soul is dead .</p>
   <p>Poor Andrea ! History has treated him harshly . He is known throughout all time as “ the tailor 's son , ” and Browning has given him in this immortal poem a condemnation that much of his work does not really deserve . For there is inspiration in many of Andrea 's Madonnas . Browning , with his fixed idea of the glory of the imperfect , the divine evidence of perpetual development , could not forgive Andrea for being called the “ faultless painter . ” Thus Browning has made of him a horrible example , has used him merely as the text for a sermon .</p>
   <p>There was just enough truth to give Browning his opportunity . The superiority of Rafael over Andrea lies precisely in the aspiration of the former 's work . Schopenhauer says the whole Christian religion is in the face of Rafael 's Saint Cecilia , “ an entire and certain gospel . ” Andrea 's virgins have more of the beauty of this world : Rafael 's have the beauty of holiness .</p>

     <l n="11">I often am much wearier than you think ,</l>

     <l n="13">As if — forgive now — should you let me sit</l>
     <l n="14">Here by the window with your hand in mine</l>
     <l n="15">And look a half-hour forth on Fiesole ,</l>
     <l n="16">Both of one mind , as married people use ,</l>

     <l n="24">For each of the five pictures we require :</l>
     <l n="25">It saves a model . So ! keep looking so —</l>
     <l n="26">My serpentining beauty , rounds on rounds !</l>
     <l n="27">— How could you ever prick those perfect ears ,</l>
     <l n="28">Even to put the pearl there ! oh , so sweet —</l>
     <l n="29">My face , my moon , my everybody 's moon ,</l>
     <l n="30">Which everybody looks on and calls his ,</l>

     <l n="40">To yonder sober pleasant Fiesole .</l>
     <l n="41">There 's the bell clinking from the chapel-top ;</l>
     <l n="42">That length of convent-wall across the way</l>
     <l n="43">Holds the trees safer , huddled more inside ;</l>
     <l n="44">The last monk leaves the garden ; days decrease ,</l>
     <l n="45">And autumn grows , autumn in everything .</l>
     <l n="46">Eh ? the whole seems to fall into a shape</l>
     <l n="47">As if I saw alike my work and self</l>
     <l n="48">And all that I was born to be and do ,</l>
     <l n="49">A twilight-piece . Love , we are in God 's hand .</l>

     <l n="110">Above and through his art — for it gives way ;</l>
     <l n="111">That arm is wrongly put — and there again —</l>
     <l n="112">A fault to pardon in the drawing 's lines ,</l>
     <l n="113">Its body , so to speak : its soul is right ,</l>

     <l n="117">Out of me , out of me ! And wherefore out ?</l>
     <l n="118">Had you enjoined them on me , given me soul ,</l>
     <l n="119">We might have risen to Rafael , I and you !</l>

     <l n="139">Yet the will 's somewhat — somewhat , too , the power —</l>
     <l n="140">And thus we half-men struggle . At the end ,</l>
     <l n="141">God , I conclude , compensates , punishes .</l>
     <l n="142">‘ Tis safer for me , if the award be strict ,</l>

     <l n="155">Over his mouth 's good mark that made the smile ,</l>
     <l n="156">One arm about my shoulder , round my neck ,</l>
     <l n="157">The jingle of his gold chain in my ear ,</l>
     <l n="158">I painting proudly with his breath on me ,</l>
     <l n="159">All his court round him , seeing with his eyes ,</l>

   <p>Karshish and Cleon are studies of the early days of Christianity . Each man writes a letter — one to a professor , one to a king — which reveals both his own nature and the steady advance of the kingdom of God . The contrast between the scientist and the man of letters is not favorable to the latter . Karshish is an ideal scientist , with a naturally skeptical mind , yet wide open , willing to learn from any and every source , thankful for every new fact ; Cleon is an intellectual snob . His mind is closed by its own culture , and he regards it as absurd that any man in humble circumstances can teach him anything . Learning , which has made the scientist modest , has made Cleon arrogant . Such is the difference between the ideal man of science , and the typical man of culture .</p>
   <p>Young Karshish was the best student in his department at the university ; he has won a travelling fellowship , and writes letters home to Professor Abib , the Dean of the Graduate School . This is the twenty-second letter , and although we have not seen the others , we may easily conjecture their style and contents . They resemble Darwin 's method of composition describing his tour around the world — one fact is noted accurately and then another . This particular letter is entrusted to a messenger who had the pink-eye ; the young doctor easily cured him , and the man having no money , begged to give some service . He winks his eyes gladly in the strong sunlight which had hurt him so cruelly until the doctor came to his relief . Very well ! he shall run with an epistle .</p>
   <p>Karshish has met Lazarus : and it is significant of Browning 's method that it is not the resurrection from the grave which interests him , nor what happened to Lazarus in the tomb ; it is the profound spiritual change in the man . Lazarus does not act like a faker ; he is not sensational , does not care whether you believe his story or not , is a thoroughly quiet , intelligent , sensible man . Only his conduct has ceased to be swayed by any selfish interest , and there is some tremendous force working in his life that puzzles the physician . It is amusing how the latter tries to shake off his obsession , how he tries to persuade himself that Lazarus had a prolonged epileptic fit , or that he is now mad ; how he tries to interest himself once more in the fauna and flora of the country . Impossible ! the story of Lazarus dominates him .</p>
   <p>His letter is naturally full of apologies for writing to the great Abib on such a theme . He is afraid Abib will be disgusted with him , will call him home , as a disgrace to the university he represents . What ! my favorite student , carefully trained in science , to swallow the story of the first madman or swindler he meets ? A man raised from the dead ? Such cases are diurnal . What would a modern professor think if one of his travelling fellows wrote home from South America that he had met a man raised from the dead , and was really impressed by his story ? His fellowship would be instantly taken away from him .</p>
   <p>He anticipates Abib 's suggestions . If you think there is really anything interesting in the yarn , why do n't you seek out the magician who brought him back to life ? Oh , naturally , I thought of that the first thing . But I discovered that the doctor who wrought the cure of Lazarus is dead , lost his life in some obscure tumult .</p>
   <p>It is with the utmost difficulty that Karshish finally brings himself to write what will seem much worse even than the acceptance of the story of Lazarus . But something impels him to out with it . Lazarus says — God forgive me for uttering such nonsensical blasphemy — that the doctor who cured him was no doctor at all — was ... was ... was Almighty God Himself ! He says God appeared on the earth in human form , that Lazarus knew Him personally , spoke with Him , ate meals with Him — and then suddenly in a revulsion of feeling at his daring to write such trash to Abib , he tries to force his mind back to report on scientific observations .</p>
   <p>He thinks indeed he has ended his letter ; when the stupendous idea of Jesus Christ rushes over his mind like a flood , and he adds a postscript . Would it not be wonderful , Professor , if Lazarus were right ? If the Supreme Force we recognise were really a God of Love , who died to save us ? The madman saith He said so : it is strange , ... it is strange ...</p>
   <p>And so we leave Karshish in a muse : but surely he is not far from the Kingdom of God .</p>
   <p>As this poem indicates the manner in which Christianity in the early days spread from man to man , while many are amazed and many doubt , so Cleon gives us the picture of the Gospel as carried over the world by Paul , Cleon in his own distinguished person sums up the last word of Greek culture , in its intellectual prowess , its serene beauty , its many-sided charm , and its total inability to save the world . Cleon is an absolute pessimist . He is sincere ; such cant as the “ choir invisible ” means nothing to him , for death will turn his splendid mind into a pinch of dust . Death is far more horrible to poets and artists than to the ignorant , he assures the king , who had thought just the opposite : is it not dreadful to think that after my death people will be singing the songs that I have written , while all that remains of me is in a little urn ? He does not deceive himself with phrases . Death is the end of us , and therefore self-consciousness is a mistake . The animals without it are happier and better than we . How terrible it is to think that a man like me who has developed steadily throughout my whole life should now face the blank wall of annihilation just when my mind is at its best , when my senses are most keen to profit by the richness and wonder of life ! The thought that individual development is thus meaningless is so repugnant not merely to his heart 's desire but to his mental sense of the fitness of things , that it has sometimes seemed as if there must be a future life where the soul can pursue its natural course ahead . But he dismisses this thought as impossible ; for if there were a future life , I should be the first to know of it . It would certainly have been revealed to a splendid mind like mine . It is the mountain peak that catches the first flush of the dawn , not the valley : it is the topmost branch of the great tree that gets the first whisper of the coming breeze . It is a pity that Cleon had not heard the Gospel . I thank thee , O Father , that Thou hast hidden these things from the wise and prudent , and hast revealed them unto babes . Even so , Father : for so it seemed good in Thy sight . It was not through men like Cleon that the Gospel made its first advance .</p>
   <p>His postscript , like that of Karshish , is interesting , though strikingly different . The king had enclosed a letter to Paul , but as he did not know Paul 's address , he wondered if Cleon would not be kind enough to see that the evangelist obtained the letter . Cleon was decidedly vexed . I neither know nor care where Paul may be . You do n't suppose for a moment that Paul knows anything I do n't know ? You do n't suppose anything Paul could say would have any weight for men like me ? Oh , I have heard of him ; I was taking a constitutional one day , and I saw a little group of persons listening to an orator . I touched a man on the shoulder , and I said , What is that idiot talking about ? And he replied that the man said that a person named Jesus Christ had risen from the dead , and could save all those who believed on Him from death . What crazy nonsense people swallow ! So Cleon smiled in his wisdom and went on his way . But through the lines of his speech we feel the rising tide of Christianity , where</p>

   <p>The poem Childe Roland is unique among Browning 's monologues . His poetry usually is of the noonday and the market-place ; but this might have been written by Coleridge , or Maeterlinck , or Edgar Allan Poe . It has indeed the “ wizard twilight Coleridge knew . ” The atmosphere is uncanny and ghoul-haunted : the scenery is a series of sombre and horrible imaginings . No consistent allegory can be made out of it , for which fact we should rejoice . It is a poem , not a sermon ; it is intended to stimulate the imagination , rather than awaken the conscience . And as we accompany the knight on his lonely and fearful journey , we feel thrills caused only by works of genius .</p>
   <p>The poem is an example of the power of creative imagination . Out of one line from an old ballad quoted by Shakespeare , Browning has built up a marvellous succession of vivid pictures . The twilight deepens as Childe Roland advances ; one can feel the darkness coming on .</p>
   <p>.... hands unseen Were hanging the night around us fast .</p>
   <p>Although the poem means nothing specifically except a triumphant close to a heart-shaking experience , the close is so solemnly splendid that it is difficult to repress a shout of physical exultation . One lonely man , in the presence of all the Powers of the Air , sends out an honest blast of defiance — the individual will against the malignant forces of the whole universe .</p>
   <p>What happened when he blew his horn ? Did the awful mountains in the blood-red sunset dissolve as the walls of Jericho fell to a similar sound ? Did the round , squat Tower vanish like a dream-phantom ? Or was the sound of the horn the last breath of the hero ? If we believe the former , then Childe Roland is telling his experience to a listener ; it is the song of the man “ who came whither he went . ” If the latter , which seems to me more dramatic , and more like Browning , then the monologue is murmured by the solitary knight as he advances on his darkening path .</p>
   <p>Three entirely different interpretations may be made of the poem . First , the Tower is the quest , and Success is found only in the moment of Failure . Second , the Tower is the quest , and when found is worth nothing : the hero has spent his life searching something that in the end is seen to be only a round , squat , blind turret — for such things do men throw away their lives ! Third , the Tower is not the quest at all — it is damnation , and when the knight turns aside from the true road to seek the Tower , he is a lost soul steadily slipping through increasing darkness to hell .</p>
   <p>Whilst I do not believe this third interpretation , for it seems to me contrary to the whole spirit of the piece , it is surprising that if one reads through the poem with that idea and none other in mind , how much support can be found for it . The hoary cripple is the devil , meant to lead us into temptation ; and the third stanza seems for the moment to complete this thought .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">If at his counsel I should turn aside</l>
     <l n="2">Into that ominous tract , which , all agree</l>
     <l n="3">Hides the Dark Tower . Yet acquiescingly</l>
     <l n="4">I did turn as he pointed :</l>
   </lg>
   <p>If all knew that the ominous tract contained the Dark Tower , why was the knight outside of it , if the Tower were his quest ? He turns aside , acquiescingly : he has given up a life of noble aspiration , and now hands over his despairing heart in surrender to the powers of darkness . He goes on his way a beaten man , only hoping that the end may not be long delayed .</p>
   <p>Much in the letter of the poem may support this view ; but the whole spirit of it is opposed to such an interpretation , and the ringing close does not sound like spiritual failure . Nor do I believe in the second interpretation ; for it is quite unlike Browning to write a magnificent poem with a cynical conclusion .</p>
   <p>No , I believe that once upon a time , Roland , Giles , Cuthbert , and other knights in solemn assembly took an oath to go on the quest of the Dark Tower : to find it or perish on the way . All but these three have apparently kept their word ; they have never returned , and when Roland is on the last stages of his journey , he sees why ; they have died a horrible death . The quest is indeed an unspeakably perilous thing : for all but Giles and Cuthbert are dead , and these two suffered a fate worse than death — the awful fear inspired by something hideous on the march changed these splendid specimens of manhood into craven traitors . Roland remembers with cruel agony the ruddy young face of Cuthbert , glowing under its yellow hair : was there ever such a magnificent fellow ? But the path to the Tower had shaken his manhood , and disgraced him forever . How well Roland remembers the morning when Giles took the oath to find the Tower ! That was ten years ago . The frank , manly young knight stepped forth , and declared proudly that he dared do all that might become a man . But he had some awful experience in the course of the quest that changed him from the soul of honor to a whimpering coward . His own companions spat upon him and cursed him .</p>
   <p>Roland alone is left . And he has experienced so many disappointments that now all hope of finding the Tower is dead in his breast . Just one spark of manhood remains . He can not succeed , but God grant that he may be fit to fail .</p>
   <p>... just to fail as they , seemed best , And all the doubt was now — should I be fit ?</p>
   <p>As he advances , the country becomes an abomination of desolation ; then appear evidences of struggle , the marks of monsters : then the awful , boiling river , with the nerve-shattering shriek from its depths as he thrust in his spear . On the other bank , fresh evidences of fearful combats , followed farther along by the appearance of engines of torture . Those of his companions who had survived the beasts had there perished in this frightful manner . Nevertheless , Roland advances , his eyes on the ground . Suddenly the wide wing of some dreadful bird of the night brushed his cap , and he looked up — to his overwhelming amazement , he sees the Tower ! He sees it as the sailor sees the rocks on a dark night , only when the ship is lost . He sees it in a sudden glare of hell ; the air is full of mocking laughter , the scorn of fiends mingling with the sound of the names of their victims , his peers and comrades , all lost ! The ugly misshapen mountains look like sinister giants , lying chin upon hand , lazily awaiting his destruction . But this atom of humanity , in the presence of all the material forces of this world and the supernatural powers of darkness , places the horn to his lips , and sends out on the evening air a shrill blast of utter defiance . He that endureth to the end shall be saved . Not his possessions , not his happiness , not his bodily frame — they all succumb : but he shall be saved .</p>
   <p>Thus we may take this wholly romantic poem as one more noble illustration of Browning 's favorite doctrine — Success in Failure .</p>

    <p>VI</p>
   <p>POEMS OF PARADOX</p>
   <p>The word paradox comes from two Greek words , meaning simply , “ beyond belief . ” As every one ought to know , a paradox is something that read literally is absurd , but if taken in the spirit in which it is uttered , may contain profound truth . Paradox is simply over-emphasis : and is therefore a favorite method of teaching . By the employment of paradox the teacher wishes to stress forcibly some aspect of the truth which otherwise may not be seen at all . Fine print needs a magnifying-glass ; and the deep truth hidden in a paradox can not perhaps become clear unless enlarged by powerful emphasis . All teachers know the value of italics .</p>
   <p>Socrates was very fond of paradox : the works of Ibsen , Nietzsche , Shaw and Chesterton are full of paradoxes : Our Lord 's utterances in the New Testament are simply one paradox after another . No wonder His disciples were often in a maze . It requires centuries for the truth in some paradoxes to become manifest .</p>
   <p>“ This was some time a paradox , but now the time gives it proof . ”</p>
   <p>Browning loved a paradox with all his heart . The original nature of his mind , his fondness for taking the other side , his over-subtlety , all drove him toward the paradox . He would have made a wonderful criminal lawyer . He loves to put some imaginary or historical character on the stand , and permit him to speak freely in his own defence ; and he particularly loves to do this , when the person has received universal condemnation . Browning seems to say , “ I wonder if the world is entirely right in this judgment : what would this individual say if given an opportunity for apologetic oratory ? ” Browning is the greatest master of special pleading in all literature . Although he detested Count Guido , he makes him present his case in the best possible light , so that for the moment he arouses our intellectual sympathy .</p>
   <p>The Glove story is one of the best-known anecdotes in history ; besides its French source , it has been told in German by Schiller , in English by Leigh Hunt , and has received thousands of allusory comments — but always from one point of view . The hooting and laughter that followed the Lady as she left the court , have been echoed in all lands . Browning pondered over this story , and took the woman 's part . This may be accounted for by two causes . He is the most chivalrous poet that ever lived , and would naturally defend the Lady . What De Lorge ought to have done when he brought the glove back was to remind the Lady that she had another , and permit him the honor of retrieving that . But Browning saw also in this incident a true paradox — the Lady was right after all ! Right in throwing the glove , right in her forecast of the event .</p>
   <p>Like a good lawyer , he first proves that the Knight 's achievement was slight . In the pit the Lion was not at that moment dangerous , because he was desperately homesick . He was lost in thoughts of his wild home , in imagination driving the flocks up the mountain , and took not the slightest notice of the glove . Then a page had leaped into the pit simply to recover his hat ; and he had done that because he could not afford to buy a new one . No one applauded him . Think of the man who had originally caught the lion ! He went out alone and trapped a lion , simply that his rude boys might be amused at the spectacle . In our degenerate days , we give our children a Teddy Bear . But in those strenuous times , the father said to his boys , “ Come out into the back yard , and see the present I 've got for you ! ” They came eagerly , and found a live lion . That man and his children were a hardy family . How they would have laughed at De Lorge 's so-called heroism !</p>
   <p>But the real truth of the matter is that De Lorge was a liar . The Lady suspected it all the time , and was saddened to have her judgment confirmed by the result . De Lorge had been boasting of his love , and of his eagerness to prove it . He had begged the Lady to test him — he would gladly die for her . Now it is important that a woman should know before marriage rather than after whether a lover 's protestations are genuine or not — in short whether he is sincere and reliable , or whether he is a liar . The reason why men lie to women and not to men is because they know that a lie to a woman can not be avenged , they can not be made to pay any penalty ; but when they lie to other men — in business affairs , for example — the penalty is severe .</p>
   <p>How could the Lady satisfy her mind ? How could she know whether De Lorge was sincere or not ? There was no war , there was no tournament , there was no quest . Suddenly one method presented itself . She tossed her glove into the pit . He had to go — he could never have held up his head otherwise . But when he returned , he dashed the glove in the Lady 's face , ostensibly to teach her that a brave man 's life should not be risked by a woman 's vanity . This was even a better gallery-play than the recovery of the glove , and succeeded splendidly . But the Lady turned sadly away .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">The blow a glove gives is but weak :</l>
     <l n="2">Does the mark yet discolour my cheek ?</l>
     <l n="3">But when the heart suffers a blow ,</l>
     <l n="4">Will the pain pass so soon , do you know ?</l>
   </lg>
   <p>What was the pain in her heart ? Her wounded vanity , her anguish at the Court 's ostracism ? Not in the least . It was her pain at finding her opinion of De Lorge justified . He was then , just as she thought , a liar ; he never meant to be taken at his word . All his protestations of love and service were mere phrases . His anger at the first test of his boasting proves this . The pain in her heart is the pain we all feel at reading of some cowardly or disloyal act ; one more man unfaithful , one more man selfish , one more who lowers the level of human nature .</p>
   <p>The paradox teaches us the very simple lesson that if we boast of our prowess , we must not be angry when some one insists that we prove it .</p>

   <p>Browning wrote two poems on pedantry ; the former , in Garden Fancies , takes the conventional view . How can a man with any blood in him pore over miserable books , when life is so sweet ? The other , A Grammarian 's Funeral , is the apotheosis of the scholar . The paradox here is that Browning has made a hero out of what seems at first blush impossible material . It is easy to make a hero out of a noble character ; it is equally easy to make a hero out of a thorough scoundrel , a train-robber , or a murderer . Milton made a splendid hero out of the Devil , But a hero out of a nincompoop ? A hero out of a dull , sexless pedant ?</p>
   <p>But this is exactly what Browning has done , nay , he has made this grammarian exactly the same kind of hero as a dashing cavalry officer leading a forlorn hope .</p>
   <p>Observe that Browning has purposely made his task as difficult as possible . Had the scholar been a great discoverer in science , a great master in philosophical thought , a great interpreter in literature — then we might all take off our hats : but this hero was a grammarian . He spent his life not on Greek drama or Greek philosophy , but on Greek Grammar . He is dead : his pupils carry his body up the mountain , as the native disciples of Stevenson carried their beloved Tusitala to the summit of the island peak . These students are not weeping ; they sing and shout as they march , for they are carrying their idol on their shoulders . His life and his death were magnificent , an inspiration to all humanity . Hurrah ! Hurrah !</p>
   <p>The swinging movement of the young men is in exact accord with the splendid advance of the thought . They tell us the history of their Teacher from his youth to his last breath :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">This is our master , famous calm and dead ,</l>
     <l n="2">Borne on our shoulders .</l>

   <p>It is a common error to suppose that missionaries , nuns , and scholars follow their chosen callings because they are unfit for anything else . The judgment of the wise world is not always correct . It assumes that these strange folk never hear the call of the blood . When John C. Calhoun was a student at Yale , his comrades , returning at midnight from a wild time , found him at his books . “ Why do n't you come out , John , and be a man ? You 'll never be young again . ” “ I regard my work as more important , ” said John quietly . Milton 's bitter cry</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Were it not better done , as others use ,</l>
     <l n="2">To sport with Amaryllis in the shade ,</l>
     <l n="3">Or with the tangles of Neæra 's hair ?</l>
   </lg>
   <p>shows that it was not the absence of temptation , but a tremendously powerful will , that kept him at his desk . When a spineless milksop becomes a missionary , when a gawk sticks to his books , when an ugly woman becomes a nun , the world makes no objection ; but when a socially prominent man goes in for missions or scholarship , when a lovely girl takes the veil , the wise world says , “ Ah , what a pity ! ”</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Browning 's Grammarian did not take up scholarship as a last resort .</l>
     <l n="2">He could have done anything he liked .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">He was a man born with thy face and throat ,</l>

   <p>He might have been an athlete , a social leader , a man of pleasure . He chose Greek Grammar . In the pursuit of this prize , he squandered his time and youth and health as recklessly as men squander these treasures on wine and women . When a young man throws away his youth and health in gambling , drink , and debauchery , the world expresses no surprise ; he is known as a “ splendid fellow , ” and is often much admired . But when a man spends all his gifts in scholarship , scientific discovery , or altruistic aims , he is regarded as an eccentric , lacking both blood and judgment .</p>
   <p>I say that Browning has given his Grammarian not only courage and heroism , but the reckless , dashing , magnificent bravery of a cavalry leader . In the march for learning , this man lost his youth and health , and acquired painful diseases . Finally he comes to the end . When an officer in battle falls , and his friends bend over him to catch his last breath , he does not say , “ I commend my soul to God , ” or “ Give my love to my wife , ” — he says , “ Did we win ? ” and we applaud this passion in the last agony . So our Grammarian , full of diseases , paralysed from the waist down , the death rattle in his throat — what does he say to the faithful watchers ? What are his last words ? He dictates Greek Grammar .</p>
   <p>The solitary student may be a paragon of courage , headstrong , reckless , tenacious as a bulldog , with a resolution entirely beyond the range of the children of this world .</p>

   <p>In the amusing poem , Up at a Villa — Down in the City , Browning compares the beauty of city and country life from an unusual point of view . It is generally assumed that the country is more poetical than the city ; but it would be difficult to prove this , if we were put to the test . Natural scenery is now much admired , and mountains are in the height of fashion ; every one is forced to express raptures , whether one feels them or not . But this has not always been the case . When Addison travelled to Italy , he regarded the Alps as disgusting ; they were a disagreeable and dangerous barrier , that must be crossed before he could reach the object of his journey . He wrote home from Italy that he was delighted at the sight of a plain — a remark that would damn a modern pilgrim . The first man in English literature to bring out the real beauty of mountains was Thomas Gray .</p>
   <p>Very few people have a sincere and genuine love of the country — as is proved by the way they flock to the cities . We love the country for a change , for a rest , for its novelty : how many of us would be willing to live there the year around ? We know that Wordsworth loved the country , for he chose to live among the lonely lakes when he could have lived in London . But most intelligent persons live in towns , and take to the country for change and recreation .</p>
   <p>The speaker in Browning 's poem is an absolutely honest Philistine , who does not know that every word he says spells artistic damnation . He is disgusted with the situation of his house :</p>
   <p>.... stuck like the horn of a bull Just on a mountain-edge as bare as the creature 's skull .</p>
   <p>In other words the site is so magnificent that to-day expensive hotels are built there , and people come from all over the world to enjoy the view . In fact it is just this situation which Browning admires in the poem De Gustibus .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">What I love best in all the world</l>
     <l n="2">Is a castle , precipice-encurled ,</l>
     <l n="3">In a gash of the wind-grieved Apennine .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>But our man does not know what he ought to say ; he says simply what he really thinks . The views of a sincere Philistine on natural scenery , works of art , pieces of music , are interesting because they are sincere . The conventional admiration may or may not be genuine .</p>
   <p>This man says the city is much cooler in summer than the country : that spring visits the city earlier : that what we call the monotonous row of houses in a city street is far more beautiful than the irregularity of the country . It appeals to his sense of beauty .</p>
   <p>Houses in four straight lines , not a single front awry .</p>
   <p>But his real rapture over the city is because city life is interesting . There is something going on every moment of the blessed day . It is a perpetual theatre , admission free . This is undoubtedly the real reason why the poor prefer crowded , squalid city tenements to the space , fresh air and hygienic advantages of the country . Many well-meaning folk wonder why men with their families remain in city slums , when they could easily secure work on farms , where there would be abundance of fresh air , wholesome food , and cool nights for sleep . Our Italian gives the correct answer . People can not stand dullness and loneliness : they crave excitement , and this is supplied day and night by the city street . Indeed in some cases , where by the Fresh Air Fund , children are taken for a vacation to the country , they become homesick for the slums .</p>

   <p>No poem of Browning 's has given more trouble to his whole-souled admirers than The Statue and the Bust : and yet , if this is taken as a paradox , its meaning is abundantly clear .</p>
   <p>The square spoken of in the poem is the Piazza Annunziata in Florence : in the midst of the square stands the equestrian statue of the Duke : and if one follows the direction of the bronze eyes of the man , it will appear that they rest steadfastly on the right hand window in the upper storey of the palace . This is the farthest window facing the East . There is no bust there ; but it is in this window that the lady sat and regarded the daily passage of the Duke .</p>
   <p>The reason why this poem has troubled the minds of many good people is because it seems ( on a very superficial view ) to sympathise with unlawful love ; even in certain circumstances to recommend the pursuit of it to fruition . Let us see what the facts are . Before the Duke saw the bride , he was , as Browning says , empty and fine like a swordless sheath . This is a good description of many young men . They are like an empty sheath . The sheath may be beautiful , it may be exquisitely and appropriately enchased ; but a sheath is no good without a sword . So , many young men are attractive and accomplished , their minds are cultivated by books and travel , but they have no driving purpose in life , no energy directed to one aim , no end ; and therefore all their attractiveness is without positive value . They are empty like a handsome sheath minus the sword .</p>
   <p>The moment the Duke saw the lady a great purpose filled his life : he became temporarily a resolute , ambitious man , with capacity for usefulness . No moral scruple kept the lovers apart ; and they determined to fly . This purpose was frustrated by procrastination , trivial hindrances , irresolution , till it was forever too late . Now the statue and the bust gaze at each other in eternal ironical mockery , for these lovers in life might as well have been made of bronze and stone ; they never really lived .</p>
   <p>Contrary to his usual custom — it is only very seldom as in this poem and in Bishop Blougram 's Apology , and in both cases because he knew he would otherwise be misunderstood — Browning added a personal postscript . Where are these lovers now ? How do they spend their time in the spiritual world ? I do not know where they are , says Browning , but I know very well where they are not : they are not with God . No , replies the reader , because they wanted to commit adultery . Ah , says Browning , they are not exiled from God because they wanted to commit adultery : they are exiled because they did not actually do it . This is the paradox .</p>
   <p>Browning takes a crime to test character ; for a crime can test character as well as a virtue . We must draw a clear distinction here between society and the individual . It is a good thing for society that people are restrained from crime by what are really bad motives — fear , presence of police , irresolution , love of ease , selfishness : furthermore , society and the law do not consider men 's motives , but only their actual deeds . A white-souled girl and a blackhearted villain with no criminal record are exactly equal in the eyes of the law , both perfectly innocent .</p>
   <p>But from the point of view of the individual , or as a Christian would say , in the sight of God , it is the heart that makes all the difference between virtue and depravity . In the case of our lovers delay was best for society , but bad for them : the purposed crime was a test of their characters , and they added the sin of cowardice to the sin of adultery , which they had already committed in their hearts . Suppose four men agree to hold up a train . When the light of the locomotive appears , three lose their courage : the fourth stops the train , and single-handed takes the money from the express-car and from the passengers , killing the conductor and the express-messenger . After the train has been sent on its way , the three timid ones divide up with the man who actually committed the crimes . Who is the most virtuous among the four ? Which has the best chance to be with God ? Manifestly the brave one , although he is a robber and a murderer . From the point of view of the people who owned the money , from the point of view of the families of the dead men , it would have been better if all four of the would-be robbers had been cowards : but for that criminal 's individual soul , he was better than his mates , because the crime tested his character and found him sound : he did not add the sin of cowardice to the sins of robbery and murder .</p>
   <p>Browning changes the figure . If you choose to play a game — no one is obliged to play , but if you do choose to play — then play with all your energy , whether the stakes are money or worthless counters . Now our lovers chose to play . The stake they played for was not the true coin of marriage , but the false counter of adultery . Still , the game was a real test of their characters , and it proved them lacking in every true quality that makes men and women noble and useful .</p>
   <p>Even now Browning knew that some readers would not understand him : so he added the last two lines , which ought to make his lesson clear . You virtuous people ( I see by your expression you disapprove and are ready to quarrel with me ) how strive you ? De te , fabula ! My whole story concerns you . You say that the lovers should have remained virtuous : you say that virtue should be the great aim of life . Very well , do you act as if you believed what you say ? Is virtue the greatest thing in your life ? Do you strive to the uttermost toward that goal ? Do you really prefer virtue to your own ease , comfort and happiness ?</p>
   <p>I find Browning 's poem both clear and morally stimulating . My one objection would be that he puts rather too much value on mere energy . I do not believe that the greatest thing in life is striving , struggle , and force : there are deep , quiet souls who accomplish much in this world without being especially strenuous . But in the sphere of virtue Browning was essentially a fighting man .</p>

   <p>The two volumes of Dramatic Idyls are full of paradoxes , for Browning became fonder and fonder of the paradox as he descended into the vale of years . The Russian poem Ivan Ivanovitch justly condemns mothers who prefer their own safety to that of their children . When a stranger gives up his life for another , as happens frequently in crises of fire and shipwreck , we applaud : but when a mother sacrifices her life for that of her child , she does the natural and expected thing . The woman in this poem was a monster of wickedness and did not deserve to live . She started with three children and arrived with none . Now there are some things in life for which no apology and no explanation suffice . What do we care about her story ? Who cares to hear her defence ? What difference does it make whether she actively threw out the children or allowed the wolves to take them ? She arrives safe and sound without them and there is no mistaking the fact that she rejoices in her own salvation . She does not rejoice long , however , for Ivan , who is Browning 's ideal of resolution , neatly removes her head . Practically and literally Ivan is a murderer : but paradoxically he is God 's servant , for the woman is not fit to live , and he eliminates her .</p>
   <p>From the practical point of view there is a difficulty ahead . The husband is due ; when he hears that the children are lost , he will suffer horribly , and will enquire anxiously as to the fate of his wife . When he learns that she arrived in good condition and that then Ivan knocked her head off , he may not fully appreciate the ethical beauty of Ivan 's deed . But this detail does not affect the moral significance of the story . Yet I can not help thinking that a man with such strong convictions as Ivan ought not to carry an axe .</p>
   <p>Ivan , however , is still needed in Russia . Two or three years ago , immediately after a wedding ceremony , the bride and groom , with the whole wedding party , set out in sledges for the next town . The wolves attacked them and ate every member of the party except the four in the first sledge — husband , wife , and two men . As the wolves drew near , these two heroes advised the husband to throw out the bride , for if he did so , the three left might be saved , as their haven was almost in sight . Naturally the bridegroom declined . Then the two men threw out both bride and groom , and just managed to reach the town in safety , the sole survivors of the whole party . I wish that Ivan had been there to give them the proper welcome .</p>
   <p>The poem Clive is a psychological analysis of courage and fear , two of the most interesting of human sensations . Clive seems to have been an instrument in the hands of Destiny . When an obscure young man , he twice tried to commit suicide , and both times the pistol missed fire . A born gambler , he judged that he was reserved for something great . He was : he conquered India . Then , after his life-work was fully accomplished , his third attempt at suicide was successful .</p>
   <p>After describing the dramatic incident at card-play , which he gave to the old buck as the only time in his life when he felt afraid , his companion remarked that it was enough to scare anybody to face a loaded pistol . But here comes the paradox . Clive was intensely angry because his friend failed to see the point . “ Why , I was n't afraid he would shoot , I was afraid he would n't . ” Suppose the general had said contemptuously that young Clive was not worth the powder and ball it would take to kill him — suppose he had sent him away wholly safe and wholly disgraced . Then Clive would have instantly killed himself . Either the general was not clever enough to play this trump , or the clear unwinking eyes of his victim convicted him of sin .</p>
   <p>Clive was one of those exceedingly rare individuals who have never known the sensation of physical fear . But I do not think he was really so brave as those men , who , cursed with an imagination that fills their minds with terror , nevertheless advance toward danger . For your real hero is one who does not allow the desires of his body to control his mind . The body , always eager for safety , comfort , and pleasure , cries out against peril : but the mind , up in the conning-tower of the brain , drives the protesting and shivering body forward . Napoleon , who was a good judge of courage , called Ney the bravest of the brave : and I admired Ney more intensely when I learned that in battle he was in his heart always afraid .</p>
   <p>The courage of soldiers in the mass seems sublime , but it is the commonest thing on earth : all nations show it : it is probably an inexplicable compound of discipline , pride , shame , and rage : but individuals differ from one another as sharply in courage as they do in mental ability . In sheer physical courage dive has never been surpassed , and Browning , who loved the manly virtues , saw in this corrupt and cruel man a great hero .</p>
   <p>The poem Muléykeh , which is one of the oldest of Oriental stories , is really an analysis of love . The mare was dearer to her owner than life itself : yet he intentionally surrendered her to his rival rather than have her disgraced . His friends called him an idiot and a fool : but he replied , “ You never have loved my Pearl . ” And indeed , from his point of view , they did not know the meaning of love . What is love ? Simply the desire for possession , or the desire that the beloved object should be incomparably pure and unsullied by defeat and disgrace ? The man who owned Muléykeh really loved her , since her honor was more precious to him than his own happiness .</p>
   <p>The short poem Which ? published on the last day of Browning 's life , is a splendid paradox . In the Middle Ages , when house-parties assembled , an immense amount of time was taken up by the telling of stories and by the subsequent discussions thereupon . The stock subject was Love , and the ideal lover was a favorite point of debate . In this instance , the three court ladies argue , and to complete the paradox , a Priest is chosen for referee . Perhaps he was thought to be out of it altogether , and thus ready to judge with an unprejudiced mind .</p>
   <p>The Duchess declares that her lover must be a man she can respect : a man of religion and patriotism . He must love his God , and his country ; then comes his wife , who holds the third place in his affections .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">I could not love thee , dear , so much ,</l>
     <l n="2">Loved I not honour more .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The Marquise insists that her lover must be a man who has done something . He must not only be a man inspired by religious and patriotic motives , but must have actually suffered in her service . He has received wounds in combat , he is pointed out everywhere as the man who has accomplished great deeds . I can not love him unless I can be proud of his record .</p>
   <p>The Comtesse says that her ideal lover must love her first : he must love her more than he loves God , more than he loves his country , more than he loves his life — yes , more than he loves his own honor . He must be willing , if necessary , not only to sacrifice his health and life in her behalf , indeed , any true knight would do that : he must be willing to sacrifice his good name , be false to his religion and a traitor to his country . What do I care whether he be a coward , a craven , a scoundrel , a hissing and a byword , so long as he loves me most of all ?</p>
   <p>This is a difficult position for the Abbé , the man of God : but he does not flinch . His decision is that the third lover is the one of whom Almighty God would approve .</p>
   <p>One thing is certain : the third man really loved his Lady . We do not know whether the other two loved or not . When a man talks a great deal about his honor , his self-respect , it is just possible that he loves himself more than he loves any one else . But the man who would go through hell to win a woman really loves that woman . Browning abhors selfishness . He detests a man who is kept from a certain course of action by thoughts of its possible results to his reputation . Ibsen has given us the standard example of what the first and second lover in this poem might sink to in a real moral crisis . In A Doll 's House , the husband curses his wife because she has committed forgery , and his good name will suffer . She replied that she committed the crime to save his life — her motive was Love : and she had hoped that when the truth came out the miracle would happen : her husband would step forward and take the blame all on himself . “ What fools you women are , ” said he , angrily : “ you know nothing of business . I would work my fingers to the bone for you : I would give up my life for you : but you can n't expect a man to sacrifice his honor for a woman . ” Her retort is one of the greatest in literature . “ Millions of women have done it . ”</p>

   <lg type="poem">
    <head>BROWNING 'S OPTIMISM</head>
    <head>Among all modern thinkers and writers , Browning is the foremost optimist . He has left not the slightest doubt on this point ; his belief is stated over and over again , running like a vein of gold through all his poems from Pauline to Asolando . The shattered man in Pauline cries at the very last ,</head>
     <l n="1">I believe in God and Truth and Love .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>This staunch affirmation , “ I believe ! ” is the common chord in Browning 's music . His optimism is in striking contrast to the attitude of his contemporaries , for the general tone of nineteenth century literature is pessimistic . Amidst the wails and lamentations of the poets , the clear , triumphant voice of Browning is refreshing even to those who are not convinced .</p>
   <p>Browning suffered for his optimism . It is generally thought that the optimist must be shallow and superficial ; whilst pessimism is associated with profound and sincere thinking . Browning felt this criticism , and replied to it with a scriptural insult in his poem At the Mermaid . I cannot possibly be a great poet , he said sneeringly , because I have never said I longed for death ; I have enjoyed life and loved it , and have never assumed a peevish attitude . In another poem he declared that pessimists were liars , because they really loved life while pretending it was all suffering .</p>
   <p>It is only fair to Browning to remember that his optimism has a philosophical basis , and is the logical result of a firmly-held view of the universe . Many unthinking persons declare that Browning , with his jaunty good spirits , gets on their nerves ; he dodges or leaps over the real obstacles in life , and thinks he has solved difficulties when he has only forgotten them . They miss in Browning the note of sorrow , of internal struggle , of despair ; and insist that he has never accurately portrayed the real bitterness of the heart 's sufferings . These critics have never read attentively Browning 's first poem .</p>
   <p>The poem Pauline shows that Browning had his Sturm und Drang , in common with all thoughtful young men . Keats ’ immortal preface to Endymion would be equally applicable to this youthful work . “ The imagination of a boy is healthy , and the mature imagination of a man is healthy ; but there is a space of life between , in which the soul is in a ferment , the character undecided , the way of life uncertain , the ambition thick-sighted : thence proceeds mawkishness , and all the thousand bitters which those men I speak of must necessarily taste in going over the following pages . ” The astonishing thing is , that Browning emerged from the slough of despond at just the time when most young men are entering it . He not only climbed out , but set his face resolutely toward the Celestial City .</p>
   <p>The poem Pauline shows that young Browning passed through skepticism , atheism , pessimism , cynicism , and that particularly dark state when the mind reacts on itself ; when enthusiasms , high hopes , and true faith seem childish ; when wit and mockery take the place of zeal , this diabolical substitution seeming for the moment to be an intellectual advance . But although he suffered from all these diseases of the soul , he quickly became convalescent and Paracelsus proves that his cure was complete .</p>
   <p>Browning 's optimism is not based on any discount of the sufferings of life , nor any attempt to overlook such gross realities as sin and pain . No pessimist has realised these facts more keenly than he . The Pope , who is the poet 's mouthpiece , calls the world a dread machinery of sin and sorrow . The world is full of sin and sorrow , but it is machinery — and machinery is meant to make something ; in this instance the product is human character , which can not be made without obstacles , struggles , and torment . In Reverie , Browning goes even farther than this in his description of terrestrial existence .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Head praises , but heart refrains</l>
     <l n="2">From loving 's acknowledgment</l>
     <l n="3">Whole losses outweigh half-gains :</l>
     <l n="4">Earth 's good is with evil blent :</l>
     <l n="5">Good struggles but evil reigns .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="6">Such an appraisal of life can hardly be called a blind and jaunty</l>
     <l n="7">optimism .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Browning declares repeatedly that the world shows clearly two attributes of God : immense force and immense intelligence . We can not worship God , however , merely because He is strong and wise ; He must be better than we are to win our respect and homage . The third necessary attribute , Love , is not at all clear in the spectacle furnished by science and history . Where then shall we seek it ? His answer is , in the revelation of God 's love through Jesus Christ .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">What lacks then of perfection fit for God</l>
     <l n="2">But just the instance which this tale supplies</l>
     <l n="3">Of love without a limit ?</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Browning 's philosophy therefore is purely Christian . The love of God revealed in the Incarnation and in our own ethical natures — our imperfect souls containing here and now the possibilities of infinite development — makes Browning believe that this is God 's world and we are God 's children . He conceives of our life as an eternal one , our existence here being merely probation . No one has ever believed more rationally and more steadfastly in the future life than our poet ; and his optimism is based solidly on this faith . The man who believes in the future life , he seems to say , may enjoy whole-heartedly and enthusiastically the positive pleasures of this world , and may endure with a firm mind its evils and its terrible sufferings . Take Christianity out of Browning , and his whole philosophy , with its cheerful outlook , falls to the ground . Of all true English poets , he is the most definitely Christian , the most sure of his ground . He wrote out his own evangelical creed in Christmas-Eve and Easter Day ; but even if we did not have these definite assurances , poems like A Death in the Desert and Gold Hair would be sufficient .</p>
   <p>Sequels are usually failures : the sequel to Saul is a notable exception to the rule . The first part of the poem , including the first nine stanzas , was published among the Dramatic Romances in 1845 : in 1855 , among the Men and Women , appeared the whole work , containing ten additional stanzas . This sequel is fully up to the standard of the original in artistic beauty , and contains a quite new climax , of even greater intensity . The ninth stanza closes with the cry “ King Saul ! ” — he represents the last word of physical manhood , the finest specimen on earth of the athlete . The eighteenth stanza closes with the cry “ See the Christ stand ! ” — He represents the climax of all human history , the appearance on earth of God in man . The first man is of the earth , earthy : the second man is the Lord from heaven . And as we have borne the image of the earthy , we shall also bear the image of the heavenly .</p>
   <p>No modern Pagan has ever sung the joy of life with more gusto than Browning trolls it out in the ninth stanza . The glorious play of the muscles , the rapture of the chase , the delight of the plunge into cold water , the delicious taste of food and wine , the unique sweetness of deep sleep . No shame attaches to earthly delights : let us rejoice in our health and strength , in exercise , recreation , eating and sleeping . Saul was a cowboy before he was a King ; and young David in his music takes the great monarch back to the happy carefree days on the pasture , before the responsibilities of the crown had given him melancholia . The effect of music on patients suffering from nervous depression is as well known now as it was in Saul 's day ; Shakespeare knew something about it . His physicians are sometimes admirable ; the great nervous specialist called in on Lady Macbeth 's case is a model of wisdom and discretion : the specialist that Queen Cordelia summoned to prescribe for her father , after giving him trional , or something of that nature , was careful to have his return to consciousness accompanied by suitable music . Such terrible fits of melancholy as afflicted Saul were called in the Old Testament the visitations of an evil spirit ; and there is no better diagnosis today . The Russian novelist Turgenev suffered exactly in the manner in which Browning describes Saul 's sickness of heart : for several days he would remain in an absolute lethargy , like the king-serpent in his winter sleep . And , as in the case of Saul , music helped him more than medicine .</p>
   <p>When David had carried the music to its fullest extent , the spirit of prophecy came upon him , as in the Messianic Psalms , and in the eighteenth stanza , he joyfully infers from the combination of man 's love and man 's weakness , that God 's love is equal to God 's power . Man 's will is powerless to change the world of atoms : from God 's will stream the stars . Yet if man 's will were equal in power to his benevolence , how quickly would I , David , restore Saul to happiness ! The fact that I love my King with such intensity , whilst I am powerless to change his condition , makes me believe in the coming of Him who shall have my wish to help humanity with the accompanying power . Man is contemptible in his strength , but divine in his ideals . ‘ Tis not what man Does which exalts him , but what man Would do !</p>
   <p>The last stanza of the poem has been thought by some critics to be a mistake , worse than superfluous . For my part , I am very glad that Browning added it . Up to this point , we have had exhibited the effect of the music on Saul : now we see the effect on the man who produced it , David . While it is of course impossible even to imagine how a genius must feel immediately after releasing some immortal work that has swollen his heart , we can not help making conjectures . If we are so affected by hearing the Ninth Symphony , what must have been the sensations of Beethoven at its birth ? When Händel wrote the Hallelujah Chorus , he declared that he saw the heavens opened , and the Son of God sitting in glory , and I think he spoke the truth . After Thackeray had written a certain passage in Vanity Fair , he rushed wildly about the room , shouting “ That 's Genius ! ”</p>
   <p>Now no man in the history of literature has been more reticent than Browning in describing his emotions after virtue had passed out of him . He never talked about his poetry if he could help it ; and the hundreds of people who met him casually met a fluent and pleasant conversationalist , who gave not the slightest sign of ever having been on the heights . We know , for example , that on the third day of January , 1852 , Browning wrote in his Paris lodgings to the accompaniment of street omnibuses the wonderful poem Childe Roland : what a marvellous day that must have been in his spiritual life ! In what a frenzy of poetic passion must have passed the hours when he saw those astounding visions , and heard the blast of the horn in the horrible sunset ! He must have been inspired by the very demon of poetry . And yet , so far as we know , he never told any one about that day , nor left any written record either of that or any other of the great moments in his life . In The Ring and the Book , he tells us of the passion , mystery and wonder that filled his soul on the night of the day when he had found the old yellow volume : but he has said nothing of his sensations when he wrote the speech of Pompilia .</p>
   <p>This is why I am glad he added the last stanza to Saul . It purports to be a picture of David 's drunken rapture , when , after the inspiration had flowed through his soul , he staggered home through the night . About him were angels , powers , unuttered , unseen , alive , aware . The whole earth was awakened , hell loosed with her crews ; the stars of night beat with emotion . David is Browning himself ; and the poet is trying to tell us , in the only way possible to a man like Browning , how the floods of his own genius affected him . He gives a somewhat similar picture in Abt Vogler . It is not in the least surprising that he could not write or talk to his friends about such marvellous experiences . Can a man who has looked on the face of God , and dwelt in the heavenly places , talk about it to others ?</p>
   <p>Furthermore this nineteenth stanza of Saul contains a picture of the dawn that has never been surpassed in poetry . Only those who have spent nights in the great woods can really understand it .</p>

      <l n="143">Of the dove , tempt the goat and its young to the green on his crest</l>
      <l n="144">For their food in the ardours of summer . One long shudder thrilled</l>
      <l n="145">All the tent till the very air tingled , then sank and was stilled</l>
      <l n="146">At the King 's self left standing before me , released and aware .</l>

      <l n="148">despair ,</l>
      <l n="149">Death was past , life not come : so he waited . Awhile his right hand</l>

      <l n="151">To their place what new objects should enter : ‘ twas Saul as before .</l>
      <l n="152">I looked up and dared gaze at those eyes , nor was hurt any more</l>
      <l n="153">Than by slow pallid sunsets in autumn , we watch from the shore ,</l>
      <l n="154">At their sad level gaze o'er the ocean — a sun 's slow decline</l>
      <l n="155">Over hills which , resolved in stern silence , o'erlap and entwine</l>
      <l n="156">Base with base to knit strength more intensely ; so , arm folded arm</l>

He saith , “ It is good ; ” still he drinks not : he lets me praise life , Gives assent , yet would die for his own part . XII</p>

   <p>On a clear , warm day in March , 1912 , I stood on the Piazza Michel Angelo in Florence , with a copy of Browning in my hand , and gazed with delight on the panorama of the fair city below . Then I read aloud the first two stanzas of Old Pictures in Florence , and realised for the thousandth time the definiteness of Browning 's poetry . This particular poem is a mixture of art and doggerel ; but even the latter is interesting to lovers of Florence .</p>
   <p>Not a churlish saint , Lorenzo Monaco ?</p>
   <p>Did you ever stand in front of the picture by Lorenzo that Browning had in mind , and observe the churlish saints ? Most saints in Italian pictures look either happy or complacent ; because they have just been elected to the society of heaven and are in for life . But for some strange reason , Lorenzo 's saints , although in the Presence , and worshipping with music , look as if they were suffering from acute indigestion . If one will wander about the galleries of Florence , and take along Browning , one will find the poet more specifically informing than Baedeker .</p>
   <p>The philosophy of this poem is Browning 's favorite philosophy of development . He compares the perfection of Greek art with the imperfection of the real human body . We know what a man ought to look like ; and if we have forgotten , we may behold a representation by a Greek sculptor . Stand at the corner of a city street , and watch the men pass ; they are caricatures of the manly form . Yet ludicrously ugly as they are , the intention is clear ; we see even in these degradations , what the figure of a man ought to be . In Greek art :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">The Truth of Man , as by God first spoken ,</l>
     <l n="2">Which the actual generations garble ,</l>
     <l n="3">Was reuttered .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Which the actual generations garble — men as we see them are clumsy and garbled versions of the original . But there is no value in lamenting this ; it is idle for men to gaze with regret and longing at the Apollo Belvedere . It is much better to remember that Perfection and Completion spell Death : only Imperfection has a future . What if the souls in our ridiculously ugly bodies become greater and grander than the marble men of Pheidias ? Giotto 's unfinished Campanile is nobler than the perfect zero he drew for the Pope . In our imperfect minds , housed in our over-fat , over-lean , and always commonplace bodies , exists the principle of development , for whose steady advance eternity is not too long . Statues belong to time : man has Forever .</p>
   <p>For some strange reason , no tourist ever goes to Fano . One reason why I went there was simply because I had never met a person of any nationality who had ever seen the town . Yet it is easily accessible , very near Ancona , the scene of the Grammarian 's Funeral , and the place where Browning wrote The Guardian Angel . One day Mr. and Mrs. Browning , walking about Fano , came to the church of San Agostino , in no way a remarkable edifice , and there in the tiny chapel , over the altar , they found Guercino 's masterpiece . Its calm and serene beauty struck an immortal poem out of Browning 's heart ; and thanks to the poet , the picture is now one of the most familiar in the world . But no copy comes near the ineffable charm of the original , as one sees it in the dim light of the chapel .</p>
   <p>The child on the tomb is looking past the angel 's face into the glory of heaven ; but the poet , who wishes that he might take the place of the little child , declares that he would gaze , not toward heaven , but into the gracious face of the bird of God . If we could only see life as the angel sees it , if we could only see the whole course of history , we should then realise that :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">All is beauty :</l>
     <l n="2">And knowing this , is love , and love is duty .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>We can not see the forest for the trees : the last place to obtain an idea of the range , grandeur , and beauty of a forest , is in it : one should climb a high mountain and look over its vast extent . So we , in life , “ where men sit and hear each other groan , ” believe that the world is some dreadful mistake , full of meaningless anguish . This is because we are in the midst of it all : we can not see far : the nearest objects , though infinitesimal in size , loom enormous , as with the palm of your hand you can cut off the sun . But if we could only see the end from the beginning , if we could get the angel 's view-point , the final result would be beauty . Browning is not satisfied with Keats 's doctrine :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Beauty is truth , truth beauty , ” — that is all</l>
     <l n="2">Ye know on earth , and all ye need to know .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>He shows us what happened to Aprile with this philosophy . Browning adds the doctrine of love . The moment we realise that the universe is conceived in terms of beauty , love fills our hearts : love for our fellow-beings , who are making the journey through life with us ; and love for God , the author of it all , just as a child loves one who gives it the gift of its heart 's desire . That the supreme duty of life is love is simply one more illustration of Browning 's steadfast adherence to the Gospel of Christ .</p>

   <p>The three poems , Caliban on Setebos , Rabbi Ben Ezra , and A Death in the Desert , should be read in that order ; for there is a logical order in the thought . The first is God as an amphibious brute would imagine him : the second is noble Hebrew theism : the third is the Christian God of Love . Whilst the second is the finest poem of the three , the first is the most original . The word “ upon ” is ironical : it is Caliban 's treatise on theology . We read Caliban on God , as we read Mill on Political Economy : for Caliban , like many a human theologian , does not scruple to speak the last word on the nature of the Supreme Being . The citation from the Psalms is a rebuke to gross anthropomorphism : Caliban , like the Puritans , has simply made God in his own image .</p>
   <p>The difference between Shakespeare 's and Browning 's Caliban is simply the difference between Shakespeare and Browning . Shakespeare made the monster for decorative purposes , to satisfy his love of the grotesque , as an architect placed gargoyles on a cathedral : the grotesque is an organic part of romantic art . Browning is interested not in Caliban 's appearance , but in his processes of thought . Suppose a monster , half fish , half beast , living with supreme comfort in the slime , could think : what kind of God would he imagine had created this world ?</p>
   <p>Caliban speaks in the third person ( does Browning make a slip when he changes occasionally to the first ? ) in order to have indicated the low order of his intelligence ; just as a little child says , “ Do n't hurt her : she has n't done anything wrong . ” He is lying in liquid refuse , with little lizards deliciously tickling his spine ( such things are entirely a matter of taste , what would be odious to us would be heaven to a sow ) and having nothing to do for the moment , like a man in absolute leisure , turns his thoughts to God . He believes that God is neither good nor bad , but simply capricious . What 's the use of being God , if you can n't do what you like ? He treats earth 's creatures as a wanton boy treats his toys ; they belong to me ; why should n't I break them if I choose ? No one ought to complain of misfortunes : you can not expect God is going to reward the virtuous and punish the guilty . He has no standards whatever . Just as I , Caliban , sit here and watch a procession of crabs : I might lazily make up my mind , in a kind of sporting interest , to count them as they pass ; to let twenty go in safety , and smash the twenty-first , loving not , hating not , just choosing so . When I feel like it , I help some creatures ; if in another mood , I torment others ; that 's the way God treats us , that 's the way I would act if I were God .</p>
   <p>As Caliban 's theology has much of the human in it , so his practical reasoning is decidedly human in its superstition . Granted that we are in the hands of a childish and capricious God , who amuses himself with torturing us , who laughs at our faces distorted with pain , what is the thing we ought to do ? How shall we best manage ? Caliban 's advice is dear : do n't let Him notice you : do n't get prominent : above all , never boast of your good fortune , for that will surely draw God 's attention , and He will put you where you belong . This superstition , that God is against us , is deep-seated in human nature , as the universal practice of “ touching wood ” sufficiently demonstrates . If a man says , “ I have n't had a cold this winter , ” his friends will advise him to touch wood ; and if he wakes up the next morning snuffling , he will probably soliloquise , “ What a fool I was ! Why could n't I keep still ? Why did I have to mention it ? Now see what I 've got ! ”</p>
   <p>Caliban disagreed with his mother Sycorax on one important point . She believed in the future life . Caliban says such a belief is absurd . There can be nothing worse than this life . Its good moments are simply devices of God to strengthen us so that He can torture us again , just as in the good old times the executioners gave the sufferers they were tormenting some powerful stimulant , so that they might return to consciousness and suffer ; for nothing cheated the spectators worse than to have the victim die during the early stages of the torture . The object was to keep the wretch alive as long as possible . Thus in this life we have moments of comparative ease and rest , wherein we recuperate a little , just as the cat lets the mouse recover strength enough to imagine he is going to get away .</p>
   <p>Caliban is of course an absolute and convinced pessimist . A malevolent giant is not so bad a God as an insane child . And Browning means that pessimism is what we should naturally expect from so rudimentary an intellect as Caliban 's , which judges the whole order of the universe from proximate and superficial evidences .</p>
   <p>The close of the poem is a good commentary on some human ideas of what kind of service is pleasing to God . Poor Caliban ! he had saved up some quails , meaning to have a delicious meal . But in his fear he cries to God , I will let them fly , if you will only spare me this time ! I will not eat whelks for a month , I will eat no chocolates during Lent , anything to please God !</p>

   </lg>
   <p>In the great poem Rabbi Ben Ezra , a quite different reason from that of Caliban 's is suggested for the drawbacks and sufferings of life . They are a part of the divine machinery employed by infinite wisdom to further human development , to make us ultimately fit to see His face . There can be no true progress without obstacles : no enjoyment without its opposite : no vacation without duties : no virtue without sin .</p>
   <p>The second line of the poem is startling in its direct contradiction of the language and lamentation of conventional poetry . Regret for lost youth and terror before old age are stock ideas in poetry , and in human meditation ; but here we are invited to look forward to old age as the best time of life . Not to grow old gracefully , in resignation , but to grow old eagerly , in triumph — this is the Rabbi 's suggestion . There is not the slightest doubt that he is right , provided one lives a mental , rather than an animal existence . A short time ago , Mr. Joseph H. Choate was addressing a large company in New York : he said , “ Unquestionably the best period of life is the time between seventy and eighty years of age : and I advise you all to hurry up and get there as soon as you can . ”</p>
   <p>God loveth whom He chasteneth . Our doubts and fears , our sorrows and pains , are spurs , stimulants to advance ; rejoice that we have them , for they are proofs that we are alive and moving !</p>
   <p>In the seventh stanza comes an audacious but cheering thought . Many thinkers regard the deepest sorrow of life as rising from the disparity between our ideals and our achievement ; Schiller , in his poem , Das Ideal und das Leben , has expressed this cause of woe in beautiful language . Browning says boldly ,</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">What I aspired to be ,</l>
     <l n="2">And was not , comforts me :</l>
   </lg>
   <p>This paradox , which comforts while it mocks , means , “ My achievements are ridiculously small in comparison with my hopes , my ambitions , my dreams : thank God for all this ! Thank God I was not content with low aims , thank God I had my aspirations and have them still : they point to future development . ”</p>
   <p>In the twenty-third , twenty-fourth and twenty-fifth stanzas , Browning suddenly returns to this idea : in the appraisement of the human soul , efforts , which if unsuccessful , count for nothing in worldly estimation , pay an enormous ultimate dividend , and must therefore be rated high . The reason why the world counts only things done and not things attempted , is because the world 's standards are too coarse : they are adapted only for gross and obvious results . You can not weigh diamonds on hay scales : the indicator would show precisely nothing . And yet one diamond , too fine for these huge scales , might be of more value than thousands of tons of hay .</p>
   <p>From the twenty-sixth stanza to the end , Browning takes up the figure of the Potter , the Wheel , and the Clay . I think that he was drawn to use this metaphor , not from Scripture , but as a protest against the use of it in Fitzgerald 's Omar Khayyám . Fitzgerald published his translation in 1859 ; and although it attracted no public attention , it is certainly possible that Browning saw it . He would have enjoyed its melodious beauty , but the philosophy of the poem would have been to him detestable and abhorrent . Much is made there of the Potter , meaning blind destiny : and the moral is , “ Drink ! the Past gone , seize To-day ! ” Browning explicitly rejects and scorns this teaching : it is propounded by fools for the benefit of other fools .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Fool ! all that is , at all ,</l>
     <l n="2">Lasts ever , past recall ;</l>
     <l n="3">Earth changes , but thy soul and God stand sure :</l>
     <l n="4">What entered into thee ,</l>
     <l n="5">That was , is , and shall be :</l>
     <l n="6">Time 's wheel runs back or stops : Potter and clay endure .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>In Browning 's metaphor , the Potter is God : the Wheel is the whirling course of life 's experiences : the Clay is man . God holds us on the wheel to turn us into the proper shape . Owing to our flaws , the strain is sometimes too great , and some of us are warped and twisted by this stern discipline : other characters , made of better material , constantly grow more beautiful and more serviceable under the treatment . Browning had suffered the greatest sorrow of his life when he wrote this poem , and yet he had faith enough to say in the thirty-first stanza , that not even while the whirl was worst , did he , bound dizzily to the terrible wheel of life , once lose his belief that he was in God 's hands and that the deep cuttings were for his ultimate benefit .</p>
   <p>In the making of a cup , the Potter engraved around the base lovely images of youth and pleasure , and near the rim skulls and signs of death : but what is a cup for ? It is meant for the Master 's lips . The nearer therefore we approach to death , the nearer we are to God 's presence , who is making us fit to slake His thirst . Finished at last , we are done forever with life 's wheel : we come to the banquet , the festal board , lamp 's flash and trumpet 's peal , the glorious appearance of the Master .</p>

   <p>Browning wrote four remarkable poems dealing with music : A Toccata of Galuppi 's , Master Hugues of Saxe-Gotha , Abt Vogler , and Charles Avison . In Abt Vogler the miracle of extemporisation has just been accomplished . The musician sits at the keys , tears running down his face : tears of weakness , because of the storm of divine inspiration that has passed through him : tears of sorrow , because he never can recapture the fine , careless rapture of his unpremeditated music : tears of joy , because he knows that on this particular day he has been the channel chosen by the Infinite God .</p>
   <p>If he had only been an architect , his dream would have remained in a permanent form . The armies of workmen would have done his will , and the world would have admired it for ages . If he had only been a poet or a painter , his inspiration would have taken the form of fixed type or enduring shape and color : but in the instance of music , the armies of thoughts that have worked together in absolute harmony to elevate the noble building of sound , which has risen like an exhalation , have vanished together with the structure they animated . It has gone like the wonderful beauty of some fantastic cloud .</p>
   <p>His sorrow at this particular irreparable loss gives way to rapture as he reflects on the source whence came the inspiration . He could not possibly have constructed such wonderful music : it was the God welling up within him : for this past hour divine inspiration has spoken through him . He has had one glimpse at the Celestial Radiance . How can he now think that the same God who expanded his heart lacks the power to fill it ? The Source from whence this river came must be inexhaustible , and it was vouchsafed to him to feel for a short time its infinite richness . The broken arcs on earth are the earnest of the perfect round in heaven .</p>
   <p>Abt Vogler says that the philosophers may each make his guess at the meaning of this earthly scheme of weal and woe : but the musicians , the musicians who have felt in their own bosoms the presence of the Divine Power and heard its marvellous voice ,— why , the philosophers may reason and welcome : ‘ tis we musicians know !</p>

   <p>In the autumn following his wife 's death Browning wrote the poem Prospice , which title means Look Forward ! This is the most original poem on death in English Literature . It shows that Browning strictly and consistently followed the moral appended to The Glove — Venienti occurrite morbo , run to meet approaching disaster !</p>
   <p>Although the prayer-book expresses the wish that the Good Lord will deliver us from battle , murder , and sudden death , that hope was founded on the old superstition that it was more important how a man died than how he lived . If a man who had lived a righteous , sober and godly life died while playing cards or in innocent laughter , with no opportunity for the ministrations of a priest , his chances for the next world were thought to be slim . On the other hand , a damnable scoundrel on the scaffold , with the clergyman 's assurances assented to , was supposed to be jerked into heaven . This view of life and death was firmly held even by so sincere and profound a thinker as Hamlet : which explains his anguish at the fate of his father killed in his sleep , and his own refusal to slay the villain Claudius at prayer .</p>
   <p>It is probable that thousands of worshippers who now devoutly pray to be delivered from sudden death , would really prefer that exit to any other . The reason is clear enough : it is to avoid the pain of slow dissolution , the sufferings of the death-bed , and the horrible fear of the dark . Now Browning boldly asks that he may be spared nothing of all these grim terrors . True to his conception of a poet , as a man who should understand all human experiences , he hopes that he may pass conscious and aware through the wonderful experience of dying . Most sick folk become unconscious hours before death and slip over the line in total coma : Browning wants to stay awake .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">I would hate that death bandaged my eyes , and forbore ,</l>
     <l n="2">And bade me creep past .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>I want to taste it all , the physical suffering , the fear of the abyss : I want to hear the raving of the fiend-voices , to be in the very thick of the fight . He adds the splendid line ,</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">For sudden the worst turns the best to the brave .</l>
     <l n="2">Brave hearts turn defeat into victory .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Browning died twenty-eight years after he wrote this poem , and his prayer was granted . He was conscious almost up to the last second , and fully aware of the nearness of death . Even the manner of death , as described in the first line of the poem , came to be his own experience : for he died of bronchitis .</p>

   <p>One can hardly repress a smile at Browning 's thorough-going optimism , when he reads the poem , Apparent Failure , and then glances back at the title . Apparent failure ! Of all the defeated sons of earth , the nameless suicides whose wretched bodies are taken to the public morgue , ought surely , we should imagine , to be classed as absolute failures . But Browning does not think so . It is possible , he says , that the reason why these poor outcasts abandoned life , was because their aspirations were so tremendously high that dull reality overpowered their spirits . Goodness is better than badness : meekness better than ferocity : calm sense than mad ravings . But , after all , these poor fellows were God 's creatures . His sun will eventually pierce the darkest cloud earth can stretch . Somewhere , after many ages in the next life , these men will develop into something better under the sunshine of the smile of God .</p>

   <p>The poem Rephan , the title of which was taken from the Book of Acts , has the same pleasant teaching we find in the play by Ludwig Fulda , called Schlaraffenland , published in 1899 . In this drama , a boy , ragged , cold , and chronically hungry , falls asleep in a miserable room , and dreams that he is in a country of unalloyed delight . Broiled chickens fly slowly by , easy to clutch and devour : expensive wardrobes await his immediate pleasure , and every conceivable wish is instantly and completely fulfilled . For a short time the boy is in ecstasies of joy : then the absence of effort , of counterbalancing privation , begins to make his heart dull : finally the paradise becomes so intolerable that he wakes with a scream — wakes in a dark , cold room , wakes in rags with his belly empty : and wakes in rapture at finding the good old earth of struggle and toil around him .</p>
   <p>Contentment is stagnation : development is happiness . The mystery of life , its uncertainty , its joys paid for by effort , these make human existence worth while .</p>
   <p>Browning delights to prove that the popular longing for static happiness would result in misery : that the sharp sides of life sting us into the real joy of living . He loves to take popular proverbs , which sum up the unconscious pessimism of humanity , and then show how false they are to fact . For example , we hear every day the expression , “ No rose without a thorn , ” and we know very well what is meant . In The Ring and the Book , Browning says :</p>
   <p>So a thorn comes to the aid of and completes the rose .</p>

   <p>Browning was an optimist with his last breath . In the Prologue to Asolando , a conventional person is supposed to be addressing the poet : he says , “ Of course your old age must be sad , because you have now lost all your youthful illusions . Once you looked on the earth with rose-colored spectacles , but now you see the naked and commonplace reality of the things you used to think so radiant . ”</p>
   <p>Browning 's answer is significant , and the figure he uses wonderfully apt . Suppose you are going to travel in Europe : you go to the optician , and you ask for a first-rate magnifying-glass , that you may scan the ocean , and view the remote corners of cathedrals . Now imagine him saying that he has for you something far better than that : he has a lovely kaleidoscope : apply your eye to the orifice , turn a little wheel , and you will behold all sorts of pretty colored rosettes . You would be naturally indignant . “ Do you take me for a child to be amused with a rattle ? I do n't want pretty colors : I want something that will bring the object , exactly as it is , as near to my eyes as it can possibly be brought . ”</p>
   <p>Indeed , when one buys a glass for a telescope , if one has sufficient cash , one buys a glass made of crown and flint glass placed together , which destroys color , which produces what is called an achromatic lens . Now just as we judge of the value of a glass by its ability to bring things as they are within the range of our vision , so , says Browning , old age is much better than youth . In age our old eyes become achromatic . The rosy illusions of youth vanish , thank God for it ! The colors which we imagined belonged to the object were in reality in our imperfect eyes — as we grow older these pretty colors disappear and we see what ? We see life itself . Life is a greater and grander thing than any fool 's illusion about it . The world of nature and man is infinitely more interesting and wonderful as it is than in any mistaken view of it . Therefore old age is better than youth .</p>

   <p>It is an interesting and dramatic parallel in literary history that Tennyson and Browning should each have published the last poem that appeared in his life-time in the same month of the same year , and that each farewell to the world should be so exactly characteristic of the poetic genius and spiritual temperament of the writer . In December , 1889 , came from the press Demeter and Other Poems , closing with Crossing the Bar — came also Asolando , closing with the Epilogue . Tennyson 's lyric is exquisite in its tints of sunset , a serene close to a long and calmly beautiful day . It is the perfect tone of dignified departure , with the admonition to refrain from weeping , with the quiet assurance that all is well . Browning 's Epilogue is full of excitement and strenuous rage : there is no hint of acquiescence ; it is a wild charge with drum and trumpet on the hidden foe . Firm in the faith , full of plans for the future , he looks not on the darkening night , but on to-morrow 's sunrise .</p>
   <p>He tells us not to pity him . He is angry at the thought that people on the streets of London , when they hear of his death will say , “ Poor Browning ! He 's gone ! How he loved life ! ” Rather he wishes that just as in this life when a friend met him in the city with a face lighted up by the pleasure of the sudden encounter , with a shout of hearty welcome — so now , when your thoughts perhaps turn to me , let it not be with sorrow or pity , but with eager recognition . I shall be striving there as I strove here : greet me with a cheer !</p>
