    <head>THE ROAD NOT TAKEN</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Two roads diverged in a yellow wood ,</l>
     <l n="2">And sorry I could not travel both</l>
     <l n="3">And be one traveler , long I stood</l>
     <l n="4">And looked down one as far as I could</l>
     <l n="5">To where it bent in the undergrowth ;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="6">Then took the other , as just as fair ,</l>
     <l n="7">And having perhaps the better claim ,</l>
     <l n="8">Because it was grassy and wanted wear ;</l>
     <l n="9">Though as for that the passing there</l>
     <l n="10">Had worn them really about the same ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="11">And both that morning equally lay</l>
     <l n="12">In leaves no step had trodden black .</l>
     <l n="13">Oh , I kept the first for another day !</l>
     <l n="14">Yet knowing how way leads on to way ,</l>
     <l n="15">I doubted if I should ever come back .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="16">I shall be telling this with a sigh</l>
     <l n="17">Somewhere ages and ages hence :</l>
     <l n="18">Two roads diverged in a wood , and I —</l>
     <l n="19">I took the one less traveled by ,</l>
     <l n="20">And that has made all the difference .</l>
    </lg>
    <p>CHRISTMAS TREES</p>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="21">( A Christmas Circular Letter )</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="22">The city had withdrawn into itself</l>
     <l n="23">And left at last the country to the country ;</l>
     <l n="24">When between whirls of snow not come to lie</l>
     <l n="25">And whirls of foliage not yet laid , there drove</l>
     <l n="26">A stranger to our yard , who looked the city ,</l>
     <l n="27">Yet did in country fashion in that there</l>
     <l n="28">He sat and waited till he drew us out</l>
     <l n="29">A-buttoning coats to ask him who he was .</l>
     <l n="30">He proved to be the city come again</l>
     <l n="31">To look for something it had left behind</l>
     <l n="32">And could not do without and keep its Christmas .</l>
     <l n="33">He asked if I would sell my Christmas trees ;</l>
     <l n="34">My woods — the young fir balsams like a place</l>
     <l n="35">Where houses all are churches and have spires .</l>
     <l n="36">I had n't thought of them as Christmas Trees .</l>
     <l n="37">I doubt if I was tempted for a moment</l>
     <l n="38">To sell them off their feet to go in cars</l>
     <l n="39">And leave the slope behind the house all bare ,</l>
     <l n="40">Where the sun shines now no warmer than the moon .</l>
     <l n="41">I 'd hate to have them know it if I was .</l>
     <l n="42">Yet more I 'd hate to hold my trees except</l>
     <l n="43">As others hold theirs or refuse for them ,</l>
     <l n="44">Beyond the time of profitable growth ,</l>
     <l n="45">The trial by market everything must come to .</l>
     <l n="46">I dallied so much with the thought of selling .</l>
     <l n="47">Then whether from mistaken courtesy</l>
     <l n="48">And fear of seeming short of speech , or whether</l>
     <l n="49">From hope of hearing good of what was mine ,</l>
     <l n="50">I said , “ There are n't enough to be worth while . ”</l>
     <l n="51">“ I could soon tell how many they would cut ,</l>
     <l n="52">You let me look them over . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="53">“ You could look .</l>
     <l n="54">But do n't expect I 'm going to let you have them . ”</l>
     <l n="55">Pasture they spring in , some in clumps too close</l>
     <l n="56">That lop each other of boughs , but not a few</l>
     <l n="57">Quite solitary and having equal boughs</l>
     <l n="58">All round and round . The latter he nodded “ Yes ” to ,</l>
     <l n="59">Or paused to say beneath some lovelier one ,</l>
     <l n="60">With a buyer 's moderation , “ That would do . ”</l>
     <l n="61">I thought so too , but was n't there to say so .</l>
     <l n="62">We climbed the pasture on the south , crossed over ,</l>
     <l n="63">And came down on the north .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="64">He said , “ A thousand . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="65">“ A thousand Christmas trees !— at what apiece ? ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="66">He felt some need of softening that to me :</l>
     <l n="67">“ A thousand trees would come to thirty dollars . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="68">Then I was certain I had never meant</l>
     <l n="69">To let him have them . Never show surprise !</l>
     <l n="70">But thirty dollars seemed so small beside</l>
     <l n="71">The extent of pasture I should strip , three cents</l>
     <l n="72">( For that was all they figured out apiece ) ,</l>
     <l n="73">Three cents so small beside the dollar friends</l>
     <l n="74">I should be writing to within the hour</l>
     <l n="75">Would pay in cities for good trees like those ,</l>
     <l n="76">Regular vestry-trees whole Sunday Schools</l>
     <l n="77">Could hang enough on to pick off enough .</l>
     <l n="78">A thousand Christmas trees I did n't know I had !</l>
     <l n="79">Worth three cents more to give away than sell ,</l>
     <l n="80">As may be shown by a simple calculation .</l>
     <l n="81">Too bad I could n't lay one in a letter .</l>
     <l n="82">I can n't help wishing I could send you one ,</l>
     <l n="83">In wishing you herewith a Merry Christmas .</l>
    </lg>
    <p>AN OLD MAN 'S WINTER NIGHT</p>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="84">All out of doors looked darkly in at him</l>
     <l n="85">Through the thin frost , almost in separate stars ,</l>
     <l n="86">That gathers on the pane in empty rooms .</l>
     <l n="87">What kept his eyes from giving back the gaze</l>
     <l n="88">Was the lamp tilted near them in his hand .</l>
     <l n="89">What kept him from remembering what it was</l>
     <l n="90">That brought him to that creaking room was age .</l>
     <l n="91">He stood with barrels round him — at a loss .</l>
     <l n="92">And having scared the cellar under him</l>
     <l n="93">In clomping there , he scared it once again</l>
     <l n="94">In clomping off ;— and scared the outer night ,</l>
     <l n="95">Which has its sounds , familiar , like the roar</l>
     <l n="96">Of trees and crack of branches , common things ,</l>
     <l n="97">But nothing so like beating on a box .</l>
     <l n="98">A light he was to no one but himself</l>
     <l n="99">Where now he sat , concerned with he knew what ,</l>
     <l n="100">A quiet light , and then not even that .</l>
     <l n="101">He consigned to the moon , such as she was ,</l>
     <l n="102">So late-arising , to the broken moon</l>
     <l n="103">As better than the sun in any case</l>
     <l n="104">For such a charge , his snow upon the roof ,</l>
     <l n="105">His icicles along the wall to keep ;</l>
     <l n="106">And slept . The log that shifted with a jolt</l>
     <l n="107">Once in the stove , disturbed him and he shifted ,</l>
     <l n="108">And eased his heavy breathing , but still slept .</l>
     <l n="109">One aged man — one man — can n't fill a house ,</l>
     <l n="110">A farm , a countryside , or if he can ,</l>
     <l n="111">It 's thus he does it of a winter night .</l>
    </lg>
    <p>A PATCH OF OLD SNOW</p>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="112">There 's a patch of old snow in a corner</l>
     <l n="113">That I should have guessed</l>
     <l n="114">Was a blow-away paper the rain</l>
     <l n="115">Had brought to rest .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="116">It is speckled with grime as if</l>
     <l n="117">Small print overspread it ,</l>
     <l n="118">The news of a day I 've forgotten —</l>
     <l n="119">If I ever read it .</l>
    </lg>
    <p>IN THE HOME STRETCH</p>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="120">She stood against the kitchen sink , and looked</l>
     <l n="121">Over the sink out through a dusty window</l>
     <l n="122">At weeds the water from the sink made tall .</l>
     <l n="123">She wore her cape ; her hat was in her hand .</l>
     <l n="124">Behind her was confusion in the room ,</l>
     <l n="125">Of chairs turned upside down to sit like people</l>
     <l n="126">In other chairs , and something , come to look ,</l>
     <l n="127">For every room a house has — parlor , bed-room ,</l>
     <l n="128">And dining-room — thrown pell-mell in the kitchen .</l>
     <l n="129">And now and then a smudged , infernal face</l>
     <l n="130">Looked in a door behind her and addressed</l>
     <l n="131">Her back . She always answered without turning .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="132">“ Where will I put this walnut bureau , lady ? ”</l>
     <l n="133">“ Put it on top of something that 's on top</l>
     <l n="134">Of something else , ” she laughed . “ Oh , put it where</l>
     <l n="135">You can to-night , and go . It 's almost dark ;</l>
     <l n="136">You must be getting started back to town . ”</l>
     <l n="137">Another blackened face thrust in and looked</l>
     <l n="138">And smiled , and when she did not turn , spoke gently ,</l>
     <l n="139">“ What are you seeing out the window , lady ? ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="140">“ Never was I beladied so before .</l>
     <l n="141">Would evidence of having been called lady</l>
     <l n="142">More than so many times make me a lady</l>
     <l n="143">In common law , I wonder . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="144">“ But I ask ,</l>
     <l n="145">What are you seeing out the window , lady ? ”</l>

     <l n="146">“ What I 'll be seeing more of in the years</l>
     <l n="147">To come as here I stand and go the round</l>
     <l n="148">Of many plates with towels many times . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="20">
     <l n="149">“ And what is that ? You only put me off . ”</l>

     <l n="150">“ Rank weeds that love the water from the dish-pan</l>
     <l n="151">More than some women like the dish-pan , Joe ;</l>
     <l n="152">A little stretch of mowing-field for you ;</l>
     <l n="153">Not much of that until I come to woods</l>
     <l n="154">That end all . And it 's scarce enough to call</l>
     <l n="155">A view . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="22">
     <l n="156">“ And yet you think you like it , dear ? ”</l>

     <l n="157">“ That 's what you 're so concerned to know ! You hope</l>

     <l n="159">Off there upstairs . The very tread of men</l>
     <l n="160">As great as those is shattering to the frame</l>
     <l n="161">Of such a little house . Once left alone ,</l>
     <l n="162">You and I , dear , will go with softer steps</l>
     <l n="163">Up and down stairs and through the rooms , and none</l>
     <l n="164">But sudden winds that snatch them from our hands</l>
     <l n="165">Will ever slam the doors . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="24">
     <l n="166">“ I think you see</l>

     <l n="177">“ No , the further off</l>

     <l n="182">It sounds as if it were the men went down ,</l>

     <l n="184">To lighted city streets we , too , have known ,</l>

    <head>BIRCHES</head>

     <l n="4">But swinging does n't bend them down to stay .</l>
     <l n="5">Ice-storms do that . Often you must have seen them</l>
     <l n="6">Loaded with ice a sunny winter morning</l>
     <l n="7">After a rain . They click upon themselves</l>
     <l n="8">As the breeze rises , and turn many-colored</l>
     <l n="9">As the stir cracks and crazes their enamel .</l>
     <l n="10">Soon the sun 's warmth makes them shed crystal shells</l>
     <l n="11">Shattering and avalanching on the snow-crust —</l>
     <l n="12">Such heaps of broken glass to sweep away</l>
     <l n="13">You 'd think the inner dome of heaven had fallen .</l>
     <l n="14">They are dragged to the withered bracken by the load ,</l>
     <l n="15">And they seem not to break ; though once they are bowed</l>
     <l n="16">So low for long , they never right themselves :</l>
     <l n="17">You may see their trunks arching in the woods</l>
     <l n="18">Years afterwards , trailing their leaves on the ground</l>
     <l n="19">Like girls on hands and knees that throw their hair</l>
     <l n="20">Before them over their heads to dry in the sun .</l>
     <l n="21">But I was going to say when Truth broke in</l>
     <l n="22">With all her matter-of-fact about the ice-storm</l>
     <l n="23">( Now am I free to be poetical ? )</l>
     <l n="24">I should prefer to have some boy bend them</l>
     <l n="25">As he went out and in to fetch the cows —</l>
     <l n="26">Some boy too far from town to learn baseball ,</l>
     <l n="27">Whose only play was what he found himself ,</l>
     <l n="28">Summer or winter , and could play alone .</l>
     <l n="29">One by one he subdued his father 's trees</l>
     <l n="30">By riding them down over and over again</l>
     <l n="31">Until he took the stiffness out of them ,</l>
     <l n="32">And not one but hung limp , not one was left</l>
     <l n="33">For him to conquer . He learned all there was</l>
     <l n="34">To learn about not launching out too soon</l>
     <l n="35">And so not carrying the tree away</l>
     <l n="36">Clear to the ground . He always kept his poise</l>
     <l n="37">To the top branches , climbing carefully</l>
     <l n="38">With the same pains you use to fill a cup</l>
     <l n="39">Up to the brim , and even above the brim .</l>
     <l n="40">Then he flung outward , feet first , with a swish ,</l>
     <l n="41">Kicking his way down through the air to the ground .</l>
     <l n="42">So was I once myself a swinger of birches .</l>
     <l n="43">And so I dream of going back to be .</l>
     <l n="44">It 's when I 'm weary of considerations ,</l>
     <l n="45">And life is too much like a pathless wood</l>
     <l n="46">Where your face burns and tickles with the cobwebs</l>
     <l n="47">Broken across it , and one eye is weeping</l>
     <l n="48">From a twig 's having lashed across it open .</l>
     <l n="49">I 'd like to get away from earth awhile</l>

     <l n="65">The doctor put him in the dark of ether .</l>
     <l n="66">He lay and puffed his lips out with his breath .</l>
     <l n="67">And then — the watcher at his pulse took fright .</l>
     <l n="68">No one believed . They listened at his heart .</l>
     <l n="69">Little — less — nothing !— and that ended it .</l>
     <l n="70">No more to build on there . And they , since they</l>
     <l n="71">Were not the one dead , turned to their affairs .</l>

    <head>THE SOUND OF THE TREES</head>

     <l n="4">More than another noise</l>

     <l n="7">Till we lose all measure of pace ,</l>
     <l n="8">And fixity in our joys ,</l>
     <l n="9">And acquire a listening air .</l>
     <l n="10">They are that that talks of going</l>
     <l n="11">But never gets away ;</l>
     <l n="12">And that talks no less for knowing ,</l>
     <l n="13">As it grows wiser and older ,</l>
     <l n="14">That now it means to stay .</l>
     <l n="15">My feet tug at the floor</l>
     <l n="16">And my head sways to my shoulder</l>
     <l n="17">Sometimes when I watch trees sway ,</l>
     <l n="18">From the window or the door .</l>
     <l n="19">I shall set forth for somewhere ,</l>
     <l n="20">I shall make the reckless choice</l>
     <l n="21">Some day when they are in voice</l>
     <l n="22">And tossing so as to scare</l>
     <l n="23">The white clouds over them on .</l>
     <l n="24">I shall have less to say ,</l>
     <l n="25">But I shall be gone .</l>
