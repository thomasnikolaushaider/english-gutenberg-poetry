      <head>THE FAIRIES DANCING</head>
       <l n="1">I heard along the early hills ,</l>
       <l n="2">Ere yet the lark was risen up ,</l>
       <l n="3">Ere yet the dawn with firelight fills</l>
       <l n="4">The night-dew of the bramble-cup ,—</l>
       <l n="5">I heard the fairies in a ring</l>
       <l n="6">Sing as they tripped a lilting round</l>
       <l n="7">Soft as the moon on wavering wing .</l>
       <l n="8">The starlight shook as if with sound ,</l>
       <l n="9">As if with echoing , and the stars</l>
       <l n="10">Prankt their bright eyes with trembling gleams</l>
       <l n="11">While red with war the gusty Mars</l>
       <l n="12">Rained upon earth his ruddy beams .</l>
       <l n="13">He shone alone , low down the West ,</l>
       <l n="14">While I , behind a hawthorn-bush ,</l>
       <l n="15">Watched on the fairies flaxen-tressed</l>
       <l n="16">The fires of the morning flush .</l>
       <l n="17">Till , as a mist , their beauty died ,</l>
       <l n="18">Their singing shrill and fainter grew ;</l>
       <l n="19">And daylight tremulous and wide</l>
       <l n="20">Flooded the moorland through and through ;</l>
       <l n="21">Till Urdon 's copper weathercock</l>
       <l n="22">Was reared in golden flame afar ,</l>
       <l n="23">And dim from moonlit dreams awoke</l>
       <l n="24">The towers and groves of Arroar .</l>

       <l n="6">Lo , betwixt green and blue</l>

       <l n="5">Where its home and earth-friends are ;</l>
       <l n="6">A milk-like air — and of light all abundance ;</l>

       <l n="12">Then stole slim Melmillo in</l>
       <l n="13">To that wood all dusk and green ,</l>
       <l n="14">And with lean long palms outspread</l>
       <l n="15">Softly a strange dance did tread ;</l>
       <l n="16">Not a note of music she</l>
       <l n="17">Had for echoing company ;</l>
       <l n="18">All the birds were flown to rest</l>
       <l n="19">In the hollow of her breast ;</l>
       <l n="20">In the wood thorn , elder , willow —</l>
       <l n="21">Danced alone — lone danced Melmillo .</l>
