     <l n="4">“ O , my children , come home ! ”</l>
     <l n="5">Her bleak gown , torn as a tattered cloud ,</l>
     <l n="6">Tosses around her like a shroud ,</l>

     <l n="12">Who walks all night and makes her moan ,</l>
     <l n="13">“ O , my children , come home ! ”</l>
     <l n="14">Whose face is raised to the blinding gale ;</l>
     <l n="15">Whose hair blows black and whose eyes are pale ,</l>

     <l n="19">She walks with the wind in the windy wood ;</l>

     <l n="21">On the way , amid the woods ,</l>
     <l n="22">Mandrakes muster multitudes ,</l>

     <l n="24">Glides the glimmering Forest-Dusk ,</l>
     <l n="25">With her fluttering moths of musk .</l>

     <l n="26">Here you hear the stealthy stir</l>

     <l n="28">Harmless things that hide and peer ,</l>
     <l n="29">Hearts that sucked the milk of fear —</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="46">Blossoms , frail and manifold ,</l>

    <head>THE WIND OF WINTER</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">The Winter Wind , the wind of death ,</l>
     <l n="2">Who knocked upon my door ,</l>
     <l n="3">Now through the key-hole entereth ,</l>
     <l n="4">Invisible and hoar ;</l>
     <l n="5">He breathes around his icy breath</l>
     <l n="6">And treads the flickering floor .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="7">I heard him , wandering in the night ,</l>
     <l n="8">Tap at my window pane ,</l>
     <l n="9">With ghostly fingers , snowy white ,</l>
     <l n="10">I heard him tug in vain ,</l>
     <l n="11">Until the shuddering candle-light</l>
     <l n="12">With fear did cringe and strain .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="13">The fire , awakened by his voice ,</l>
     <l n="14">Leapt up with frantic arms ,</l>
     <l n="15">Like some wild babe that greets with noise</l>
     <l n="16">Its father home who storms ,</l>
     <l n="17">With rosy gestures that rejoice</l>
     <l n="18">And crimson kiss that warms .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="19">Now in the hearth he sits and , drowned</l>
     <l n="20">Among the ashes , blows ;</l>
     <l n="21">Or through the room goes stealing ‘ round</l>
     <l n="22">On cautious-stepping toes ,</l>
     <l n="23">Deep mantled in the drowsy sound</l>
     <l n="24">Of night that sleets and snows .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="25">And oft , like some thin fairy-thing ,</l>
     <l n="26">The stormy hush amid ,</l>
     <l n="27">I hear his captive trebles ring</l>
     <l n="28">Beneath the kettle 's lid ;</l>
     <l n="29">Or now a harp of elfland string</l>
     <l n="30">In some dark cranny hid .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="31">Again I hear him , imp-like , whine</l>
     <l n="32">Cramped in the gusty flue ;</l>
     <l n="33">Or knotted in the resinous pine</l>
     <l n="34">Raise goblin cry and hue ,</l>
     <l n="35">While through the smoke his eyeballs shine ,</l>
     <l n="36">A sooty red and blue .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="37">At last I hear him , nearing dawn ,</l>
     <l n="38">Take up his roaring broom ,</l>
     <l n="39">And sweep wild leaves from wood and lawn ,</l>
     <l n="40">And from the heavens the gloom ,</l>
     <l n="41">To show the gaunt world lying wan ,</l>
     <l n="42">And morn 's cold rose a-bloom .</l>

    <head>LOVE DESPISED</head>
     <l n="1">Can one resolve and hunt it from one 's heart ?</l>
     <l n="2">This love , this god and fiend , that makes a hell</l>
     <l n="3">Of many a life , in ways no tongue can tell ,</l>
     <l n="4">No mind divine , nor any word impart .</l>
     <l n="5">Would not one think the slights that make hearts smart ,</l>
     <l n="6">The ice of love 's disdain , the wint'ry well</l>
     <l n="7">Of love 's disfavor , love 's own fire would quell ?</l>
     <l n="8">Or school its nature , too , to its own art .</l>
     <l n="9">Why will men cringe and cry forever here</l>
     <l n="10">For that which , once obtained , may prove a curse ?</l>
     <l n="11">Why not remember that , however fair ,</l>
     <l n="12">Decay is wed to Beauty ? That each year</l>
     <l n="13">Takes somewhat from the riches of her purse ,</l>
     <l n="14">Until at last her house of pride stands bare ?</l>

    <head>THE DEATH OF LOVE</head>
     <l n="1">So Love is dead , the Love we knew of old !</l>
     <l n="2">And in the sorrow of our hearts ’ hushed halls</l>
     <l n="3">A lute lies broken and a flower falls ;</l>
     <l n="4">Love 's house is empty and his hearth is cold .</l>
     <l n="5">Lone in dim places , where sweet vows were told .</l>
     <l n="6">In walks grown desolate , by ruined walls ,</l>
     <l n="7">Beauty decays ; and on their pedestals</l>
     <l n="8">Dreams crumble , and th ’ immortal gods are mould .</l>
     <l n="9">Music is slain or sleeps ; one voice alone ,</l>
     <l n="10">One voice awakes , and like a wandering ghost</l>
     <l n="11">Haunts all the echoing chambers of the Past —</l>
     <l n="12">The voice of Memory , that stills to stone</l>
     <l n="13">The soul that hears ; the mind that , utterly lost ,</l>
     <l n="14">Before its beautiful presence stands aghast .</l>

   <p>JOHN P. MORTON &amp; COMPANY PUBLISHERS LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY .</p>
   <p>WILLIAM DEAN HOWELLS , in the North American Review for January , 1902 .</p>
   <p>“ One never praises an author for certain things without afterward doubting if they were the characteristic things , or whether just the reverse might not be said . Praise is , in fact , a delicate business , and I , who am rather fond of dealing in it , never feel quite safe . Not only is it questionable at the moment , but the later behavior of the author is sometimes such that one is sorry not to have made it blame . It is always with a shrinking , which I try to hide from the public , that I take up the fresh venture of a poet whom I have once bet on . But there is a joy when I find that I have not lost my wager , which is full compensation for the anxiety suffered . This joy has lately been mine in the latest little book of Mr. Madison Cawein , whose work I long ago confessed my pleasure in . I am not sure that he has transcended the limits which he then seemed to give himself as the lover , the prophet , of beauty in the woods and waters and skies of the southern Mid-West . I do not know that he need have done more than unlock the riches of emotion within these limits . What I am sure of is that in ‘ Weeds by the Wall ’ he has more deeply charmed me with an art perfected from that I felt in ‘ Blooms of the Berry ’ ten or fifteen years since . Many little books of his have come ( I hope not also gone ) between the first and last , and none of them has failed to make me glad of his work ; and now , again , I am finding the same impassioned moods in the same impassive presences . To my knowledge , no such nature poems have been written within the time since Mr. Cawein began to write as his are , or from such an intimacy with the ‘ various language ’ which nature speaks . There are other good poems in the book , poems which would have made reputes in the eighteenth century , and which it would be a shame not to own good in the twentieth ; but those which speak for ‘ The Cricket , ’ ‘ A Twilight Moth , ’ ‘ The Grasshopper , ’ ‘ The Tree-Toad , ’ ‘ The Screech Owl , ’ ‘ The Chipmunk , ’ ‘ Drouth , ’ ‘ Before the Rain , ’ and the like , are in a voice which interprets the very soul of what we call the inarticulate things , though they seem to have enunciated themselves so distinctly to this poet . It is cheap to note his increasing control of his affluent imagery and the growing mastery that makes him so fine an artist . These things were to be expected from his early poems , but what makes one think he will go far and long , and outlive both praise and blame , is the blending of a sense of the Kentucky civilization in such a poem as ‘ Feud . ’ ... Civilization may not be quite the word for the condition of things suggested here , but there can be no doubt of the dramatic and the graphic power that suggests it , and that imparts a personal sense of the tragic squalor , the sultry drouth , the forlorn wickedness of it all . By such a way as this lies Mr. Cawein 's hope of rise from nature up to man , if it is up ; and also , as I perceive too late , lies confusion for the critic who said that the poet does not transcend the limits he once seemed to give himself . ”</p>
