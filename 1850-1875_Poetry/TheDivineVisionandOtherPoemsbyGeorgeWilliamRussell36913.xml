COMRADES IN THE CRAFT When twilight flutters the mountains over , The faery lights from the earth unfold : And over the caves enchanted hover The giant heroes and gods of old . The bird of aether its flaming pinions Waves over earth the whole night long : The stars drop down in their blue dominions To hymn together their choral song . The child of earth in his heart grows burning , Mad for the night and the deep unknown ; His alien flame in a dream returning Seats itself on the ancient throne . When twilight over the mountains fluttered , And night with its starry millions came , I too had dreams : the songs I have uttered Come from this heart that was touched by the flame .</docImprint>

     <head>THE DIVINE VISION</head>
     <lg>
       <l n="2">This mood hath known all beauty , for it sees</l>
       <l n="3">O'erwhelmed majesties</l>
       <l n="4">In these pale forms , and kingly crowns of gold</l>
       <l n="5">On brows no longer bold ,</l>
       <l n="6">And through the shadowy terrors of their hell</l>
       <l n="7">The love for which they fell .</l>
       <l n="8">And how desire which cast them in the deep</l>
       <l n="9">Called God too from His sleep .</l>
       <l n="10">Oh , pity , only seer , who looking through</l>
       <l n="11">A heart melted like dew ,</l>
       <l n="12">Seest the long perished in the present thus ,</l>
       <l n="13">For ever dwell in us .</l>
       <l n="14">Whatever time thy golden eyelids ope</l>
       <l n="15">They travel to a hope ;</l>
       <l n="16">Not only backward from these low degrees</l>
       <l n="17">To starry dynasties ,</l>
       <l n="18">But , looking far where now the silence owns</l>
       <l n="19">And rules from empty thrones ,</l>
       <l n="20">Thou seest the enchanted hills of heaven burn</l>
       <l n="21">For joy at our return .</l>
       <l n="22">Thy tender kiss hath memory we are kings</l>
       <l n="23">For all our wanderings .</l>
       <l n="24">Thy shining eyes already see the after</l>
       <l n="25">In hidden light and laughter .</l>

      <head>THE GATES OF DREAMLAND</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">It 's a lonely road through bogland to the lake at Carrowmore ,</l>
       <l n="2">And a sleeper there lies dreaming where the water laps the shore ;</l>
       <l n="3">Though the moth-wings of the twilight in their purples are unfurled ,</l>
       <l n="4">Yet his sleep is filled with music by the masters of the world .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="5">There 's a hand is white as silver that is fondling with his hair :</l>
       <l n="6">There are glimmering feet of sunshine that are dancing by him there :</l>
       <l n="7">And half-open lips of faery that were dyed a faery red</l>
       <l n="8">In their revels where the Hazel Tree its holy clusters shed .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="9">“ Come away , ” the red lips whisper , “ all the world is weary now ;</l>
       <l n="10">‘ Tis the twilight of the ages and it 's time to quit the plough .</l>
       <l n="11">Oh , the very sunlight 's weary ere it lightens up the dew ,</l>
       <l n="12">And its gold is changed and faded before it falls to you .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="13">“ Though your colleen 's heart be tender , a tenderer heart is near .</l>
       <l n="14">What 's the starlight in her glances when the stars are shining clear ?</l>
       <l n="15">Who would kiss the fading shadow when the flower-face glows above ?</l>
       <l n="16">‘ Tis the Beauty of all Beauty that is calling for your love . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="17">Oh , the great gates of the mountain have opened once again ,</l>
       <l n="18">And the sound of song and dancing falls upon the ears of men ,</l>
       <l n="19">And the Land of Youth lies gleaming flushed with rainbow light and mirth ,</l>
       <l n="20">And the old enchantment lingers in the honey-heart of earth .</l>

      <head>THE MASTER SINGER</head>
       <l n="1">A laughter in the diamond air , a music in the trembling grass ;</l>
       <l n="2">And one by one the words of light as joydrops through my being pass :</l>
       <l n="3">“ I am the sunlight in the heart , the silver moon-glow in the mind ;</l>
       <l n="4">My laughter runs and ripples through the wavy tresses of the wind .</l>
       <l n="5">I am the fire upon the hills , the dancing flame that leads afar</l>
       <l n="6">Each burning hearted wanderer , and I the dear and homeward star .</l>
       <l n="7">A myriad lovers died for me , and in their latest yielded breath</l>
       <l n="8">I woke in glory giving them immortal life though touched by death .</l>
       <l n="9">They knew me from the dawn of time : if Hermes beats his rainbow wings ,</l>
       <l n="10">If Angus shakes his locks of light , or golden-haired Apollo sings ,</l>
       <l n="11">It matters not the name , the land : my joy in all the Gods abides :</l>
       <l n="12">Even in the cricket in the grass some dimness of me smiles and hides .</l>
       <l n="13">For joy of me the daystar glows , and in delight and wild desire</l>
       <l n="14">The peacock twilight rays aloft its plumes and blooms of shadowy fire ,</l>
       <l n="15">Where in the vastness too I burn through summer nights and ages long ,</l>
       <l n="16">And with the fiery-footed watchers shake in myriad dance and song . ”</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">There were many burning hours on the heart-sweet tide ,</l>
       <l n="2">And we passed away from ourselves , forgetting all</l>
       <l n="3">The immortal moods that faded , the god who died ,</l>

       <l n="5">There were ruby dews were shed when the heart was riven ,</l>

       <l n="7">And we passed away , unremembering and unforgiven ,</l>

       <l n="9">Love unremembered and heart-ache we left behind ,</l>

      <head>DANA</head>
       <l n="1">I am the tender voice calling “ Away , ”</l>
       <l n="2">Whispering between the beatings of the heart ,</l>
       <l n="3">And inaccessible in dewy eyes</l>
       <l n="4">I dwell , and all unkissed on lovely lips ,</l>
       <l n="5">Lingering between white breasts inviolate ,</l>
       <l n="6">And fleeting ever from the passionate touch ,</l>
       <l n="7">I shine afar , till men may not divine</l>
       <l n="8">Whether it is the stars or the beloved</l>
       <l n="9">They follow with rapt spirit . And I weave</l>
       <l n="10">My spells at evening , folding with dim caress ,</l>
       <l n="11">Aerial arms and twilight dropping hair ,</l>
       <l n="12">The lonely wanderer by wood or shore ,</l>
       <l n="13">Till , filled with some deep tenderness , he yields ,</l>
       <l n="14">Feeling in dreams for the dear mother heart</l>
       <l n="15">He knew , ere he forsook the starry way ,</l>
       <l n="16">And clings there , pillowed far above the smoke</l>
       <l n="17">And the dim murmur from the duns of men .</l>
       <l n="18">I can enchant the trees and rocks , and fill</l>
       <l n="19">The dumb brown lips of earth with mystery ,</l>
       <l n="20">Make them reveal or hide the god . I breathe</l>
       <l n="21">A deeper pity than all love , myself</l>
       <l n="22">Mother of all , but without hands to heal :</l>
       <l n="23">Too vast and vague , they know me not . But yet ,</l>
       <l n="24">I am the heartbreak over fallen things ,</l>
       <l n="25">The sudden gentleness that stays the blow ,</l>
       <l n="26">And I am in the kiss that foemen give</l>
       <l n="27">Pausing in battle , and in the tears that fall</l>
       <l n="28">Over the vanquished foe , and in the highest ,</l>
       <l n="29">Among the Danaan gods , I am the last</l>
       <l n="30">Council of mercy in their hearts where they</l>
       <l n="31">Mete justice from a thousand starry thrones .</l>

       <l n="1">A cabin on the mountain side hid in a grassy nook</l>
       <l n="2">Where door and windows open wide that friendly stars may look .</l>

       <l n="1">Not unremembering we pass our exile from the starry ways :</l>
       <l n="2">One timeless hour in time we caught from the long night of endless days .</l>
       <l n="3">With solemn gaiety the stars danced far withdrawn on elfin heights :</l>
       <l n="4">The lilac breathed amid the shade of green and blue and citron lights .</l>
       <l n="5">But yet the close enfolding night seemed on the phantom verge of things ,</l>
       <l n="6">For our adoring hearts had turned within from all their wanderings :</l>
       <l n="7">For beauty called to beauty , and there thronged at the enchanter 's will</l>
       <l n="8">The vanished hours of love that burn within the Ever-living still .</l>
       <l n="9">And sweet eternal faces put the shadows of the earth to rout ,</l>
       <l n="10">And faint and fragile as a moth your white hand fluttered and went out .</l>
       <l n="11">Oh , who am I who tower beside this goddess of the twilight air ?</l>
       <l n="12">The burning doves fly from my heart , and melt within her bosom there .</l>
       <l n="13">I know the sacrifice of old they offered to the mighty queen ,</l>
       <l n="14">And this adoring love has brought us back the beauty that has been .</l>
       <l n="15">As to her worshippers she came descending from her glowing skies ,</l>
       <l n="16">So Aphrodite I have seen with shining eyes look through your eyes :</l>
       <l n="17">One gleam of the ancestral face which lighted up the dawn for me :</l>
       <l n="18">One fiery visitation of the love the gods desire in thee !</l>

      <head>A SUMMER NIGHT</head>
       <l n="1">Her mist of primroses within her breast</l>
       <l n="2">Twilight hath folded up , and o'er the west ,</l>
       <l n="3">Seeking remoter valleys long hath gone ,</l>
       <l n="4">Not yet hath come her sister of the dawn .</l>
       <l n="5">Silence and coolness now the earth enfold ,</l>
       <l n="6">Jewels of glittering green , long mists of gold ,</l>
       <l n="7">Hazes of nebulous silver veil the height ,</l>
       <l n="8">And shake in tremors through the shadowy night .</l>
       <l n="9">Heard through the stillness , as in whispered words ,</l>
       <l n="10">The wandering God-guided wings of birds</l>
       <l n="11">Ruffle the dark . The little lives that lie</l>
       <l n="12">Deep hid in grass join in a long-drawn sigh</l>
       <l n="13">More softly still ; and unheard through the blue</l>
       <l n="14">The falling of innumerable dew ,</l>
       <l n="15">Lifts with grey fingers all the leaves that lay</l>
       <l n="16">Burned in the heat of the consuming day .</l>
       <l n="17">The lawns and lakes lie in this night of love ,</l>
       <l n="18">Admitted to the majesty above .</l>
       <l n="19">Earth with the starry company hath part ;</l>
       <l n="20">The waters hold all heaven within their heart ,</l>
       <l n="21">And glimmer o'er with wave-lips everywhere</l>
       <l n="22">Lifted to meet the angel lips of air .</l>
       <l n="23">The many homes of men shine near and far ,</l>
       <l n="24">Peace-laden as the tender evening star ,</l>
       <l n="25">The late home-coming folk anticipate</l>
       <l n="26">Their rest beyond the passing of the gate ,</l>
       <l n="27">And tread with sleep-filled hearts and drowsy feet .</l>
       <l n="28">Oh , far away and wonderful and sweet</l>
       <l n="29">All this , all this . But far too many things</l>
       <l n="30">Obscuring , as a cloud of seraph wings</l>
       <l n="31">Blinding the seeker for the Lord behind ,</l>
       <l n="32">I fall away in weariness of mind .</l>
       <l n="33">And think how far apart are I and you ,</l>
       <l n="34">Beloved , from those spirit children who</l>
       <l n="35">Felt but one single Being long ago ,</l>
       <l n="36">Whispering in gentleness and leaning low</l>
       <l n="37">Out of its majesty , as child to child .</l>
       <l n="38">I think upon it all with heart grown wild .</l>
       <l n="39">Hearing no voice , howe'er my spirit broods ,</l>
       <l n="40">No whisper from the dense infinitudes ,</l>
       <l n="41">This world of myriad things whose distance awes .</l>
       <l n="42">Ah me ; how innocent our childhood was !</l>

      <head>A MIDNIGHT MEDITATION</head>
       <l n="1">How often have I said ,</l>
       <l n="2">“ We may not grieve for the immortal dead . ”</l>
       <l n="3">And now , poor blenched heart .</l>
       <l n="4">Thy ruddy hues all tremulous depart .</l>
       <l n="5">Why be with fate at strife</l>
       <l n="6">Because one passes on from death to life ,</l>
       <l n="7">Who may no more delay</l>
       <l n="8">Rapt from our strange and pitiful dream away</l>
       <l n="9">By One with ancient claim</l>
       <l n="10">Who robes her with the spirit like a flame .</l>
       <l n="11">Not lost this high belief —</l>
       <l n="12">Oh , passionate heart , what is thy cause for grief ?</l>
       <l n="13">Is this thy sorrow now ,</l>
       <l n="14">She in eternal beauty may not bow</l>
       <l n="15">Thy troubles to efface</l>
       <l n="16">As in old time a head with gentle grace</l>
       <l n="17">All tenderly laid by thine</l>
       <l n="18">Taught thee the nearness of the love divine .</l>
       <l n="19">Her joys no more for thee</l>
       <l n="20">Than the impartial laughter of the sea ,</l>
       <l n="21">Her beauty no more fair</l>
       <l n="22">For thee alone , but starry , everywhere .</l>
       <l n="23">Her pity dropped for you</l>
       <l n="24">No more than heaven above with healing dew</l>
       <l n="25">Favours one home of men —</l>
       <l n="26">Ah ! grieve not ; she becomes herself again ,</l>
       <l n="27">And passed beyond thy sight</l>
       <l n="28">She roams along the thought-swept fields of light ,</l>
       <l n="29">Moving in dreams until</l>
       <l n="30">She finds again the root of ancient will ,</l>
       <l n="31">The old heroic love</l>
       <l n="32">That emptied once the heavenly courts above .</l>
       <l n="33">The angels heard from earth</l>
       <l n="34">A mournful cry which shattered all their mirth ,</l>
       <l n="35">Raised by a senseless rout</l>
       <l n="36">Warring in chaos with discordant shout ,</l>
       <l n="37">And that the pain might cease</l>
       <l n="38">They grew rebellious in the Master 's peace ;</l>
       <l n="39">And falling downward then</l>
       <l n="40">The angelic lights were crucified in men ;</l>
       <l n="41">Leaving so radiant spheres</l>
       <l n="42">For earth 's dim twilight ever wet with tears</l>
       <l n="43">That through those shadows dim</l>
       <l n="44">Might breathe the lovely music brought from Him .</l>
       <l n="45">And now my grief I see</l>
       <l n="46">Was but that ancient shadow part of me ,</l>
       <l n="47">Not yet attuned to good ,</l>
       <l n="48">Still blind and senseless in its warring mood ,</l>
       <l n="49">I turn from it and climb</l>
       <l n="50">To the heroic spirit of the prime ,</l>
       <l n="51">The light that well foreknew</l>
       <l n="52">All the dark ways that it must journey through .</l>
       <l n="53">Yet seeing still again ,</l>
       <l n="54">A distant glory o'er the hills of pain ,</l>
       <l n="55">Through all that chaos wild</l>
       <l n="56">A breath as gentle as a little child ,</l>
       <l n="57">Through earth transformed , divine ,</l>
       <l n="58">The Christ-soul of the universe to shine .</l>

    <head>NOTE</head>
    <p n="1">As the mythological references made in a few poems may partially obscure the meaning for those unacquainted with Celtic tradition , I have appended here a brief commentary on the names mentioned .</p>
    <p n="2">Angus , the Celtic Eros . In the bardic stories he is described as a tall , golden-haired youth playing on a harp and surrounded by singing birds . The kisses of these birds created love and also brought death .</p>
    <p n="3">Balor , the prince of the dark powers . His eye turned every living thing it rested on into stone . He was killed at the battle of Moytura by Lugh the Sun-god .</p>
    <p n="4">Dana , the Hibernian mother of the gods who were named from her Tuatha De Danaan , or the Tribes of the goddess Dana . They are also sometimes called the Sidhe .</p>
    <p n="5">Etain , a Celtic goddess who is the subject of a famous story , “ The Wooing of Etain . ” She left the heaven world and became the wife of an ancient Irish king .</p>
    <p n="6">Lir , the Oceanus of Celtic mythology . Probably the Great Deep or original divinity from whom all sprang . His son Mananan MacLir was the most spiritual divinity known to the ancient Gael . Lir is more familiar as the father of the children who were changed into swans by magic , and who lived for long ages on the waters around the Irish coast . The story of the fate of the children of Lir was probably in its earliest form a mythological account of the descent of the spirit from the Heaven-world to the Earth and its final redemption .</p>
    <p n="7">Lugh , the great god of light who led the De Danaans at the battle of Moytura , and who slew Balor of the Evil Eye by a cast from his sling . He is a Celtic Hermes or Apollo .</p>
    <p n="8">Fomor , the dark powers who were opposed to the hosts of light , the Tuatha De Danaan . They enslaved the latter for a time until the De Danaans rose , led by Lugh the Sun-god , and defeated the Fomors in the battle of Moytura .</p>
    <p n="9">Silver Hand . Nuada , one of the Danaan divinities , is called Nuada of the Silver Hand .</p>
    <p n="10">Hound of Ulla . Cuculain , the great champion of the Red Branch cycle of tales .</p>
    <p n="11">Sacred Hazel , the Celtic tree of life . It grew over Connla 's Well , and the fruit which fell from it were the Nuts of Knowledge which give wisdom and inspiration . Connla 's Well is a Celtic equivalent of the First Fountain of mysticism . As an old story states , “ The folk of many arts have all drunk from that fountain . ”</p>
    <p n="12">“ The three great waves ” are “ the wave of Toth , the wave of Rury , and the long , slow , white-foaming wave of Cluna . ” In the bardic stories these three mystical waves shout round the coast of Ireland in recognition of great kings and heroes .</p>
    <p n="13">“ The Feast of Age , ” the druidic form of the mysteries . It was instituted by Mananan MacLir , and whoever partook of the feast became immortal .</p>
