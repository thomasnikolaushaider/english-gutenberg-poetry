      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="2">High on his Patmos of the Southern Seas</l>
       <l n="3">Our northern dreamer sleeps ,</l>
       <l n="4">Strange stars above him , and above his grave</l>
       <l n="5">Strange leaves and wings their tropic splendours wave ,</l>
       <l n="6">While , far beneath , mile after shimmering mile ,</l>
       <l n="7">The great Pacific , with its faery deeps ,</l>
       <l n="8">Smiles all day long its silken secret smile .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="9">Son of a race nomadic , finding still</l>
       <l n="10">Its home in regions furthest from its home ,</l>
       <l n="11">Ranging untired the borders of the world ,</l>
       <l n="12">And resting but to roam ;</l>
       <l n="13">Loved of his land , and making all his boast</l>
       <l n="14">The birthright of the blood from which he came ,</l>
       <l n="15">Heir to those lights that guard the Scottish coast ,</l>
       <l n="16">And caring only for a filial fame ;</l>
       <l n="17">Proud , if a poet , he was Scotsman most ,</l>
       <l n="18">And bore a Scottish name .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="19">Death , that long sought our poet , finds at last ,</l>
       <l n="20">Death , that pursued him over land and sea :</l>
       <l n="21">Not his the flight of fear , the heart aghast</l>
       <l n="22">With stony dread of immortality ,</l>
       <l n="23">He fled ‘ not cowardly ’ ;</l>
       <l n="24">Fled , as some captain , in whose shaping hand</l>
       <l n="25">Lie the momentous fortunes of his land ,</l>
       <l n="26">Sheds not vainglorious blood upon the field ,</l>
       <l n="27">Death ! why at last he finds his treasure isle ,</l>
       <l n="28">And he the pirate of its hidden hoard ;</l>
       <l n="29">Life ! ‘ twas the ship he sailed to seek it in ,</l>
       <l n="30">And Death is but the pilot come aboard ,</l>
       <l n="31">Methinks I see him smile a boy 's glad smile</l>
       <l n="32">On maddened winds and waters , reefs unknown ,</l>
       <l n="33">As thunders in the sail the dread typhoon ,</l>
       <l n="34">And in the surf the shuddering timbers groan ;</l>
       <l n="35">Horror ahead , and Death beside the wheel :</l>
       <l n="36">Then — spreading stillness of the broad lagoon ,</l>
       <l n="37">And lap of waters round the resting keel .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="38">Strange Isle of Voices ! must we ask in vain ,</l>
       <l n="39">In vain beseech and win no answering word ,</l>
       <l n="40">Save mocking echoes of our lonely pain</l>
       <l n="41">From lonely hill and bird ?</l>
       <l n="42">Island beneath whose unrelenting coast ,</l>
       <l n="43">As though it never in the sun had been ,</l>
       <l n="44">The whole world 's treasure lieth sunk and lost ,</l>
       <l n="45">Unsunned , unseen .</l>
       <l n="46">For , either sunk beyond the diver 's skill ,</l>
       <l n="47">There , fathoms deep , our gold is all arust ,</l>
       <l n="48">Or in that island it is hoarded still .</l>
       <l n="49">Yea , some have said , within thy dreadful wall</l>
       <l n="50">There is a folk that know not death at all ,</l>
       <l n="51">The loved we lost , the lost we love , are there .</l>
       <l n="52">Will no kind voice make answer to our cry ,</l>
       <l n="53">Give to our aching hearts some little trust ,</l>
       <l n="54">Show how ‘ tis good to live , but best to die ?</l>
       <l n="55">Some voice that knows</l>
       <l n="56">Whither the dead man goes :</l>
       <l n="57">We hear his music from the other side ,</l>
       <l n="58">Maybe a little tapping on the door ,</l>
       <l n="59">A something called , a something sighed —</l>
       <l n="60">No more .</l>
       <l n="61">O for some voice to valiantly declare</l>
       <l n="62">The best news true !</l>
       <l n="63">Then , Happy Island of the Happy Dead ,</l>
       <l n="64">How gladly would we spread</l>
       <l n="65">Impatient sail for you !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="66">O vanished loveliness of flowers and faces ,</l>
       <l n="67">Treasure of hair , and great immortal eyes ,</l>
       <l n="68">Are there for these no safe and secret places ?</l>
       <l n="69">And is it true that beauty never dies ?</l>
       <l n="70">Soldiers and saints , haughty and lovely names ,</l>
       <l n="71">Women who set the whole wide world in flames ,</l>
       <l n="72">Poets who sang their passion to the skies ,</l>
       <l n="73">And lovers wild and wise :</l>
       <l n="74">Fought they and prayed for some poor flitting gleam ,</l>
       <l n="75">Was all they loved and worshipped but a dream ?</l>
       <l n="76">Is Love a lie and fame indeed a breath ,</l>
       <l n="77">And is there no sure thing in life — but death ?</l>
       <l n="78">Or may it be , within that guarded shore ,</l>
       <l n="79">He meets Her now whom I shall meet no more</l>
       <l n="80">Till kind Death fold me ‘ neath his shadowy wing :</l>
       <l n="81">She whom within my heart I softly tell</l>
       <l n="82">That he is dead whom once we loved so well ,</l>
       <l n="83">He , the immortal master whom I sing .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="84">Immortal ! yea , dare we the word again ,</l>
       <l n="85">If aught remaineth of our mortal day ,</l>
       <l n="86">That which is written — shall it not remain ?</l>
       <l n="87">That which is sung , is it not built for aye ?</l>
       <l n="88">Faces must fade , for all their golden looks ,</l>
       <l n="89">Unless some poet them eternalise ,</l>
       <l n="90">Make live those golden looks in golden books ;</l>
       <l n="91">Death , soon or late , will quench the brightest eyes —</l>
       <l n="92">‘ Tis only what is written never dies .</l>
       <l n="93">Yea , memories that guard like sacred gold</l>
       <l n="94">Some sainted face , they also must grow old ,</l>
       <l n="95">Pass and forget , and think — or darest thou not !—</l>
       <l n="96">On all the beauty that is quite forgot .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="97">Strange craft of words , strange magic of the pen ,</l>
       <l n="98">Whereby the dead still talk with living men ;</l>
       <l n="99">Whereby a sentence , in its trivial scope ,</l>
       <l n="100">May centre all we love and all we hope ;</l>
       <l n="101">And in a couplet , like a rosebud furled ,</l>
       <l n="102">Lie all the wistful wonder of the world .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="9">
       <l n="103">Old are the stars , and yet they still endure ,</l>
       <l n="104">Old are the flowers , yet never fail the spring :</l>
       <l n="105">Why is the song that is so old so new ,</l>
       <l n="106">Known and yet strange each sweet small shape and hue ?</l>
       <l n="107">How may a poet thus for ever sing ,</l>
       <l n="108">Thus build his climbing music sweet and sure ,</l>
       <l n="109">As builds in stars and flowers the Eternal mind ?</l>
       <l n="110">Ah , Poet , that is yours to seek and find !</l>
       <l n="111">Yea , yours that magisterial skill whereby</l>
       <l n="112">God put all Heaven in a woman 's eye ,</l>
       <l n="113">Nature 's own mighty and mysterious art</l>
       <l n="114">That knows to pack the whole within the part :</l>
       <l n="115">The shell that hums the music of the sea ,</l>
       <l n="116">The little word big with Eternity ,</l>
       <l n="117">The cosmic rhythm in microcosmic things —</l>
       <l n="118">One song the lark and one the planet sings ,</l>
       <l n="119">One kind heart beating warm in bird and tree —</l>
       <l n="120">To hear it beat , who knew so well as he ?</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="10">
       <l n="121">Virgil of prose ! far distant is the day</l>

       <l n="124">‘ We know him not , this master , nor his fame . ’</l>
       <l n="125">Not for so swift forgetfulness you wrought ,</l>
       <l n="126">Day upon day , with rapt fastidious pen ,</l>
       <l n="127">Turning , like precious stones , with anxious thought ,</l>
       <l n="128">This word and that again and yet again ,</l>
       <l n="129">Seeking to match its meaning with the world ;</l>
       <l n="130">Nor to the morning stars gave ears attent ,</l>
       <l n="131">That you , indeed , might ever dare to be</l>

       <l n="1">Is it the Spring ?</l>
       <l n="2">Or are the birds all wrong</l>
       <l n="3">That play on flute and viol ,</l>
       <l n="4">A thousand strong ,</l>
       <l n="5">In minstrel galleries</l>
       <l n="6">Of the long deep wood ,</l>
       <l n="7">Epiphanies</l>
       <l n="8">Of bloom and bud .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="9">Grave minstrels those ,</l>
       <l n="10">Of deep responsive chant ;</l>
       <l n="11">But see how yonder goes ,</l>
       <l n="12">Dew-drunk , with giddy slant ,</l>
       <l n="13">Yon Shelley-lark ,</l>
       <l n="14">And hark !</l>
       <l n="15">Him on the giddy brink</l>
       <l n="16">Of pearly heaven</l>
       <l n="17">His fairy anvil clink .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="18">Or watch , in fancy ,</l>
       <l n="19">How the brimming note</l>
       <l n="20">Falls , like a string of pearls ,</l>
       <l n="21">From out his heavenly throat ;</l>
       <l n="22">Or like a fountain</l>
       <l n="23">In Hesperides ,</l>
       <l n="24">Raining its silver rain ,</l>
       <l n="25">In gleam and chime ,</l>
       <l n="26">On backs of ivory girls —</l>
       <l n="27">Twice happy rhyme !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="28">Ah , none of these</l>
       <l n="29">May make it plain ,</l>
       <l n="30">No image we may seek</l>
       <l n="31">Shall match the magic of his gurgling beak .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="32">And many a silly thing</l>

       <l n="35">And sideway peeps ,</l>
       <l n="36">And flitters little wing ,</l>
       <l n="37">Seems in his consequential way</l>
       <l n="38">To tell of Spring .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="39">The river warbles soft and runs</l>
       <l n="40">With fuller curve and sleeker line ,</l>

       <l n="42">Twigs of unbudding iron shine ,</l>

       <l n="48">There is no maid , how true ,</l>
       <l n="49">Is half so chaste</l>
       <l n="50">As the pure kiss of greening willow wands</l>

       <l n="56">Upon the warm bright air :</l>
       <l n="57">Why , ‘ tis the heavenly palm ,</l>
       <l n="58">The Christian tree ,</l>
       <l n="59">Whose budding is a psalm</l>

       <l n="72">And where it sleeps ,</l>
       <l n="73">Throughout the winter long ,</l>
       <l n="74">O sweet mysterious power</l>

       <l n="1">Vast and mysterious brother , ere was yet of me</l>
       <l n="2">So much as men may poise upon a needle 's end ,</l>
       <l n="3">Still shook with laughter all this monstrous might of thee ,</l>
       <l n="4">And still with haughty crest it called the morning friend .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="5">Thy latticed column jetted up the bright blue air ,</l>
       <l n="6">Tall as a mast it was , and stronger than a tower ;</l>
       <l n="7">Three hundred winters had beheld thee mighty there ,</l>
       <l n="8">Before my little life had lived one little hour .</l>

       <l n="9">With rocky foot stern-set like iron in the land ,</l>
       <l n="10">With leafy rustling crest the morning sows with pearls ,</l>
       <l n="11">Huge as a minster , half in heaven men saw thee stand ,</l>
       <l n="12">Thy rugged girth the waists of fifty Eastern girls .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="13">Knotted and warted , slabbed and armoured like the hide</l>

       <l n="1">This life I squander , hating the long days</l>

       <l n="21">Nor fled to low nepenthes for your pain !</l>
       <l n="22">Hadst said — “ Is she not here ? more reason then</l>
       <l n="23">To live as though still guarded by her eyes ,</l>
       <l n="24">Cleaner my thought , and purer be my deed ;</l>
