     <lg type="stanza" n="1">
      <l n="1">Max plac 'd a ring on little Katie 's hand ,</l>
      <l n="2">A silver ring that he had beaten out</l>
      <l n="3">From that same sacred coin — first well-priz 'd wage</l>
      <l n="4">For boyish labour , kept thro ’ many years .</l>
      <l n="5">“ See , Kate , ” he said , “ I had no skill to shape</l>
      <l n="6">Two hearts fast bound together , so I grav 'd</l>
      <l n="7">Just K. and M ., for Katie and for Max . ”</l>
      <l n="8">“ But , look ; you 've run the lines in such a way ,</l>
      <l n="9">That M. is part of K ., and K. of M ., ”</l>
      <l n="10">Said Katie , smiling . “ Did you mean it thus ?</l>
      <l n="11">I like it better than the double hearts . ”</l>
      <l n="12">“ Well , well , ” he said , “ but womankind is wise !</l>
      <l n="13">Yet tell me , dear , will such a prophecy</l>
      <l n="14">Not hurt you sometimes , when I am away ?</l>
      <l n="15">Will you not seek , keen ey 'd , for some small break</l>
      <l n="16">In those deep lines , to part the K. and M .</l>
      <l n="17">For you ? Nay , Kate , look down amid the globes</l>
      <l n="18">Of those large lilies that our light canoe</l>
      <l n="19">Divides , and see within the polish 'd pool</l>
      <l n="20">That small , rose face of yours ,— so dear , so fair ,—</l>
      <l n="21">A seed of love to cleave into a rock ,</l>
      <l n="22">And bourgeon thence until the granite splits</l>
      <l n="23">Before its subtle strength . I being gone —</l>
      <l n="24">Poor soldier of the axe — to bloodless fields ,</l>
      <l n="25">( Inglorious battles , whether lost or won ) .</l>
      <l n="26">That sixteen summer 'd heart of yours may say :</l>
      <l n="27">“ ‘ I but was budding , and I did not know</l>
      <l n="28">My core was crimson and my perfume sweet ;</l>
      <l n="29">I did not know how choice a thing I am ;</l>
      <l n="30">I had not seen the sun , and blind I sway 'd</l>
      <l n="31">To a strong wind , and thought because I sway 'd ,</l>
      <l n="32">‘ Twas to the wooer of the perfect rose —</l>
      <l n="33">That strong , wild wind has swept beyond my ken —</l>
      <l n="34">The breeze I love sighs thro ’ my ruddy leaves . ”</l>
      <l n="35">“ O , words ! ” said Katie , blushing , “ only words !</l>
      <l n="36">You build them up that I may push them down ;</l>
      <l n="37">If hearts are flow'rs , I know that flow'rs can root —</l>
      <l n="38">“ Bud , blossom , die — all in the same lov 'd soil ;</l>
      <l n="39">They do so in my garden . I have made</l>
      <l n="40">Your heart my garden . If I am a bud</l>
      <l n="41">And only feel unfoldment — feebly stir</l>
      <l n="42">Within my leaves : wait patiently ; some June ,</l>
      <l n="43">I 'll blush a full-blown rose , and queen it , dear ,</l>
      <l n="44">In your lov 'd garden . Tho ’ I be a bud ,</l>
      <l n="45">My roots strike deep , and torn from that dear soil</l>
      <l n="46">Would shriek like mandrakes — those witch things I read</l>
      <l n="47">Of in your quaint old books . Are you content ? ”</l>
      <l n="48">“ Yes — crescent-wise — but not to round , full moon .</l>
      <l n="49">Look at yon hill that rounds so gently up</l>
      <l n="50">From the wide lake ; a lover king it looks ,</l>
      <l n="51">In cloth of gold , gone from his bride and queen ;</l>
      <l n="52">And yet delayed , because her silver locks</l>
      <l n="53">Catch in his gilded fringes ; his shoulders sweep</l>
      <l n="54">Into blue distance , and his gracious crest ,</l>
      <l n="55">Not held too high , is plum 'd with maple groves ;—</l>
      <l n="56">One of your father 's farms . A mighty man ,</l>
      <l n="57">Self-hewn from rock , remaining rock through all . ”</l>
      <l n="58">“ He loves me , Max , ” said Katie : “ Yes , I know —</l>
      <l n="59">A rock is cup to many a crystal spring .</l>
      <l n="60">Well , he is rich ; those misty , peak-roof 'd barns —</l>
      <l n="61">Leviathans rising from red seas of grain —</l>
      <l n="62">Are full of ingots , shaped like grains of wheat .</l>
      <l n="63">His flocks have golden fleeces , and his herds</l>
      <l n="64">Have monarchs worshipful , as was the calf</l>
      <l n="65">Aaron call 'd from the furnace ; and his ploughs ,</l>
      <l n="66">Like Genii chained , snort o'er his mighty fields .</l>
      <l n="67">He has a voice in Council and in Church — ”</l>
      <l n="68">“ He work 'd for all , ” said Katie , somewhat pain 'd .</l>
      <l n="69">“ Aye , so , dear love , he did ; I heard him tell</l>
      <l n="70">How the first field upon his farm was ploughed .</l>
      <l n="71">He and his brother Reuben , stalwart lads ,</l>
      <l n="72">Yok 'd themselves , side by side , to the new plough ;</l>
      <l n="73">Their weaker father , in the grey of life</l>
      <l n="74">( But rather the wan age of poverty</l>
      <l n="75">Than many winters ) , in large , gnarl 'd hands</l>
      <l n="76">The plunging handles held ; with mighty strains</l>
      <l n="77">They drew the ripping beak through knotted sod ,</l>
      <l n="78">Thro ’ tortuous lanes of blacken 'd , smoking stumps ;</l>
      <l n="79">And past great flaming brush heaps , sending out</l>
      <l n="80">Fierce summers , beating on their swollen brows .</l>
      <l n="81">O , such a battle ! had we heard of serfs</l>
      <l n="82">Driven to like hot conflict with the soil ,</l>
      <l n="83">Armies had march 'd and navies swiftly sail 'd</l>
      <l n="84">To burst their gyves . But here 's the little point —</l>
      <l n="85">The polish 'd di'mond pivot on which spins</l>
      <l n="86">The wheel of Difference — they OWN 'D the rugged soil ,</l>
      <l n="87">And fought for love — dear love of wealth and pow'r ,</l>
      <l n="88">And honest ease and fair esteem of men ;</l>
      <l n="89">One 's blood heats at it ! ” “ Yet you said such fields</l>
      <l n="90">Were all inglorious , ” Katie , wondering , said .</l>
      <l n="91">“ Inglorious ? yes ; they make no promises</l>
      <l n="92">Of Star or Garter , or the thundering guns</l>
      <l n="93">That tell the earth her warriors are dead .</l>
      <l n="94">Inglorious ! aye , the battle done and won</l>
      <l n="95">Means not — a throne propp 'd up with bleaching bones ;</l>
      <l n="96">A country sav 'd with smoking seas of blood ;</l>
      <l n="97">A flag torn from the foe with wounds and death ;</l>
      <l n="98">Or Commerce , with her housewife foot upon</l>
      <l n="99">Colossal bridge of slaughter 'd savages ,</l>
      <l n="100">The Cross laid on her brawny shoulder , and</l>
      <l n="101">In one sly , mighty hand her reeking sword ;</l>
      <l n="102">And in the other all the woven cheats</l>
      <l n="103">From her dishonest looms . Nay , none of these .</l>
      <l n="104">It means — four walls , perhaps a lowly roof ;</l>
      <l n="105">Kine in a peaceful posture ; modest fields ;</l>
      <l n="106">A man and woman standing hand in hand</l>
      <l n="107">In hale old age , who , looking o'er the land ,</l>
      <l n="108">Say : ‘ Thank the Lord , it all is mine and thine ! ’</l>
      <l n="109">It means , to such thew 'd warriors of the Axe</l>
      <l n="110">As your own father ;— well , it means , sweet Kate ,</l>
      <l n="111">Outspreading circles of increasing gold ,</l>
      <l n="112">A name of weight ; one little daughter heir .</l>
      <l n="113">Who must not wed the owner of an axe ,</l>
      <l n="114">Who owns naught else but some dim , dusky woods</l>
      <l n="115">In a far land ; two arms indifferent strong — ”</l>
      <l n="116">“ And Katie 's heart , ” said Katie , with a smile ;</l>
      <l n="117">For yet she stood on that smooth , violet plain ,</l>
      <l n="118">Where nothing shades the sun ; nor quite believed</l>
      <l n="119">Those blue peaks closing in were aught but mist</l>
      <l n="120">Which the gay sun could scatter with a glance .</l>
      <l n="121">For Max , he late had touch 'd their stones , but yet</l>
      <l n="122">He saw them seam 'd with gold and precious ores ,</l>
      <l n="123">Rich with hill flow'rs and musical with rills .</l>
      <l n="124">“ Or that same bud that will be Katie 's heart ,</l>
      <l n="125">Against the time your deep , dim woods are clear 'd ,</l>
      <l n="126">And I have wrought my father to relent . ”</l>
      <l n="127">“ How will you move him , sweet ? why , he will rage</l>
      <l n="128">And fume and anger , striding o'er his fields ,</l>
      <l n="129">Until the last bought king of herds lets down</l>
      <l n="130">His lordly front , and rumbling thunder from</l>
      <l n="131">His polish 'd chest , returns his chiding tones .</l>
      <l n="132">How will you move him , Katie , tell me how ? ”</l>
      <l n="133">“ I 'll kiss him and keep still — that way is sure , ”</l>
      <l n="134">Said Katie , smiling . “ I have often tried . ”</l>
      <l n="135">“ God speed the kiss , ” said Max , and Katie sigh 'd ,</l>
      <l n="136">With pray'rful palms close seal 'd , “ God speed the axe ! ”</l>

      <l n="146">The South Wind laid his moccasins aside ,</l>
      <l n="147">Broke his gay calumet of flow'rs , and cast</l>
      <l n="148">His useless wampun , beaded with cool dews ,</l>
      <l n="149">Far from him , northward ; his long , ruddy spear</l>
      <l n="150">Flung sunward , whence it came , and his soft locks</l>
      <l n="151">Of warm , fine haze grew silver as the birch .</l>
      <l n="152">His wigwam of green leaves began to shake ;</l>

      <l n="154">The small ponds pouted up their silver lips ;</l>

      <l n="160">At morn the sharp breath of the night arose</l>
      <l n="161">From the wide prairies , in deep struggling seas ,</l>
      <l n="162">In rolling breakers , bursting to the sky ;</l>
      <l n="163">In tumbling surfs , all yellow 'd faintly thro ’</l>
      <l n="164">With the low sun — in mad , conflicting crests ,</l>
      <l n="165">Voic 'd with low thunder from the hairy throats</l>
      <l n="166">Of the mist-buried herds ; and for a man</l>
      <l n="167">To stand amid the cloudy roll and moil ,</l>
      <l n="168">The phantom waters breaking overhead ,</l>
      <l n="169">Shades of vex 'd billows bursting on his breast ,</l>
      <l n="170">Torn caves of mist wall 'd with a sudden gold ,</l>
      <l n="171">Reseal 'd as swift as seen — broad , shaggy fronts ,</l>
      <l n="172">Fire-ey 'd and tossing on impatient horns</l>
      <l n="173">The wave impalpable — was but to think</l>
      <l n="174">A dream of phantoms held him as he stood .</l>
      <l n="175">The late , last thunders of the summer crash 'd ,</l>
      <l n="176">Where shrieked great eagles , lords of naked cliffs .</l>
      <l n="177">The pulseless forest , lock 'd and interlock 'd</l>
      <l n="178">So closely , bough with bough , and leaf with leaf ,</l>
      <l n="179">So serf 'd by its own wealth , that while from high</l>
      <l n="180">The moons of summer kiss 'd its green-gloss 'd locks ;</l>
      <l n="181">And round its knees the merry West Wind danc 'd ;</l>
      <l n="182">And round its ring , compacted emerald ;</l>
      <l n="183">The south wind crept on moccasins of flame ;</l>
      <l n="184">And the fed fingers of th ’ impatient sun</l>
      <l n="185">Pluck 'd at its outmost fringes — its dim veins</l>
      <l n="186">Beat with no life — its deep and dusky heart ,</l>
      <l n="187">In a deep trance of shadow , felt no throb</l>
      <l n="188">To such soft wooing answer : thro ’ its dream</l>
      <l n="189">Brown rivers of deep waters sunless stole ;</l>
      <l n="190">Small creeks sprang from its mosses , and amaz 'd ,</l>

      <l n="192">Above the great , dead , heart of some red chief ,</l>
      <l n="193">Slipp 'd on soft feet , swift stealing through the gloom ,</l>
      <l n="194">Eager for light and for the frolic winds .</l>
      <l n="195">In this shrill moon the scouts of winter ran</l>
      <l n="196">From the ice-belted north , and whistling shafts</l>
      <l n="197">Struck maple and struck sumach — and a blaze</l>
      <l n="198">Ran swift from leaf to leaf , from bough to bough ;</l>
      <l n="199">Till round the forest flash 'd a belt of flame .</l>
      <l n="200">And inward lick 'd its tongues of red and gold</l>
      <l n="201">To the deep , tranied inmost heart of all .</l>
      <l n="202">Rous 'd the still heart — but all too late , too late .</l>
      <l n="203">Too late , the branches welded fast with leaves ,</l>
      <l n="204">Toss 'd , loosen 'd , to the winds — too late the sun</l>
      <l n="205">Pour 'd his last vigor to the deep , dark cells</l>
      <l n="206">Of the dim wood . The keen , two-bladed Moon</l>
      <l n="207">Of Falling Leaves roll 'd up on crested mists</l>
      <l n="208">And where the lush , rank boughs had foiled the sun</l>
      <l n="209">In his red prime , her pale , sharp fingers crept</l>
      <l n="210">After the wind and felt about the moss ,</l>
      <l n="211">And seem 'd to pluck from shrinking twig and stem</l>
      <l n="212">The burning leaves — while groan 'd the shudd'ring wood .</l>
      <l n="213">Who journey 'd where the prairies made a pause ,</l>
      <l n="214">Saw burnish 'd ramparts flaming in the sun ,</l>
      <l n="215">With beacon fires , tall on their rustling walls .</l>
      <l n="216">And when the vast , horn 'd herds at sunset drew</l>
      <l n="217">Their sullen masses into one black cloud ,</l>
      <l n="218">Rolling thund'rous o'er the quick pulsating plain ,</l>
      <l n="219">They seem 'd to sweep between two fierce red suns</l>
      <l n="220">Which , hunter-wise , shot at their glaring balls</l>
      <l n="221">Keen shafts , with scarlet feathers and gold barbs ,</l>
      <l n="222">By round , small lakes with thinner , forests fring 'd ,</l>
      <l n="223">More jocund woods that sung about the feet</l>
      <l n="224">And crept along the shoulders of great cliffs ;</l>
      <l n="225">The warrior stags , with does and tripping fawns ,</l>
      <l n="226">Like shadows black upon the throbbing mist</l>
      <l n="227">Of Evening 's rose , flash 'd thro ’ the singing woods —</l>
      <l n="228">Nor tim'rous , sniff 'd the spicy , cone-breath 'd air ;</l>
      <l n="229">For never had the patriarch of the herd</l>
      <l n="230">Seen limn 'd against the farthest rim of light</l>
      <l n="231">Of the low-dipping sky , the plume or bow</l>
      <l n="232">Of the red hunter ; nor when stoop 'd to drink ,</l>
      <l n="233">Had from the rustling rice-beds heard the shaft</l>
      <l n="234">Of the still hunter hidden in its spears ;</l>
      <l n="235">His bark canoe close-knotted in its bronze ,</l>
      <l n="236">His form as stirless as the brooding air ,</l>
      <l n="237">His dusky eyes too , fix 'd , unwinking , fires ;</l>
      <l n="238">His bow-string tighten 'd till it subtly sang</l>
      <l n="239">To the long throbs , and leaping pulse that roll 'd</l>
      <l n="240">And beat within his knotted , naked breast .</l>
      <l n="241">There came a morn . The Moon of Falling Leaves ,</l>
      <l n="242">With her twin silver blades had only hung</l>
      <l n="243">Above the low set cedars of the swamp</l>
      <l n="244">For one brief quarter , when the sun arose</l>
      <l n="245">Lusty with light and full of summer heat ,</l>
      <l n="246">And pointing with his arrows at the blue ,</l>
      <l n="247">Clos 'd wigwam curtains of the sleeping moon ,</l>
      <l n="248">Laugh 'd with the noise of arching cataracts ,</l>
      <l n="249">And with the dove-like cooing of the woods ,</l>
      <l n="250">And with the shrill cry of the diving loon</l>
      <l n="251">And with the wash of saltless , rounded seas ,</l>
      <l n="252">And mock 'd the white moon of the Falling Leaves .</l>
      <l n="253">“ Esa ! esa ! shame upon you , Pale Face !</l>
      <l n="254">“ Shame upon you , moon of evil witches !</l>
      <l n="255">“ Have you kill 'd the happy , laughing Summer ?</l>
      <l n="256">“ Have you slain the mother of the Flowers</l>
      <l n="257">“ With your icy spells of might and magic ?</l>
      <l n="258">“ Have you laid her dead within my arms ?</l>
      <l n="259">“ Wrapp 'd her , mocking , in a rainbow blanket .</l>
      <l n="260">“ Drown 'd her in the frost mist of your anger ?</l>
      <l n="261">“ She is gone a little way before me ;</l>
      <l n="262">“ Gone an arrow 's flight beyond my vision ;</l>
      <l n="263">“ She will turn again and come to meet me ,</l>
      <l n="264">“ With the ghosts of all the slain flowers ,</l>
      <l n="265">“ In a blue mist round her shining tresses ;</l>
      <l n="266">“ In a blue smoke in her naked forests —</l>

      <l n="268">“ She will linger , touching all the places ,</l>
      <l n="269">“ Bare and naked , with her golden fingers ,</l>
      <l n="270">“ Saying , ‘ Sleep , and dream of me , my children</l>

      <l n="290">“ ‘ At the spirit words of Indian Summer ! ’ ”</l>
      <l n="291">“ Thus , O Moon of Falling Leaves , I mock you !</l>
      <l n="292">“ Have you slain my gold-ey 'd squaw , the Summer ? ”</l>
      <l n="293">The mighty morn strode laughing up the land ,</l>
      <l n="294">And Max , the labourer and the lover , stood</l>
      <l n="295">Within the forest 's edge , beside a tree ;</l>
      <l n="296">The mossy king of all the woody tribes ,</l>
      <l n="297">Whose clatt'ring branches rattl 'd , shuddering ,</l>
      <l n="298">As the bright axe cleav 'd moon-like thro ’ the air ,</l>
      <l n="299">Waking strange thunders , rousing echoes link 'd</l>
      <l n="300">From the full , lion-throated roar , to sighs</l>
      <l n="301">Stealing on dove-wings thro ’ the distant aisles .</l>
      <l n="302">Swift fell the axe , swift follow 'd roar on roar ,</l>
      <l n="303">Till the bare woodland bellow 'd in its rage ,</l>
      <l n="304">As the first-slain slow toppl 'd to his fall .</l>
      <l n="305">“ O King of Desolation , art thou dead ? ”</l>
      <l n="306">Thought Max , and laughing , heart and lips , leap 'd on</l>
      <l n="307">The vast , prone trunk . “ And have I slain a King ?</l>
      <l n="308">“ Above his ashes will I build my house —</l>
      <l n="309">No slave beneath its pillars , but — a King ! ”</l>
      <l n="310">Max wrought alone , but for a half-breed lad ,</l>
      <l n="311">With tough , lithe sinews and deep Indian eyes ,</l>
      <l n="312">Lit with a Gallic sparkle . Max , the lover , found</l>
      <l n="313">The labourer 's arms grow mightier day by day —</l>
      <l n="314">More iron-welded as he slew the trees ;</l>
      <l n="315">And with the constant yearning of his heart</l>
      <l n="316">Towards little Kate , part of a world away ,</l>
      <l n="317">His young soul grew and shew 'd a virile front ,</l>
      <l n="318">Full-muscl 'd and large statur 'd , like his flesh .</l>
      <l n="319">Soon the great heaps of brush were builded high ,</l>
      <l n="320">And like a victor , Max made pause to clear</l>
      <l n="321">His battle-field , high strewn with tangl 'd dead .</l>
      <l n="322">Then roar 'd the crackling mountains , and their fires</l>
      <l n="323">Met in high heaven , clasping flame with flame .</l>
      <l n="324">The thin winds swept a cosmos of red sparks</l>
      <l n="325">Across the bleak , midnight sky ; and the sun</l>
      <l n="326">Walk 'd pale behind the resinous , black smoke .</l>
      <l n="327">And Max car 'd little for the blotted sun ,</l>
      <l n="328">And nothing for the startl 'd , outshone stars ;</l>
      <l n="329">For Love , once set within a lover 's breast ,</l>
      <l n="330">Has its own Sun — it 's own peculiar sky ,</l>
      <l n="331">All one great daffodil — on which do lie</l>
      <l n="332">The sun , the moon , the stars — all seen at once ,</l>
      <l n="333">And never setting ; but all shining straight</l>
      <l n="334">Into the faces of the trinity ,—</l>
      <l n="335">The one belov 'd , the lover , and sweet Love !</l>
      <l n="336">It was not all his own , the axe-stirr 'd waste .</l>
      <l n="337">In these new days men spread about the earth ,</l>
      <l n="338">With wings at heel — and now the settler hears ,</l>
      <l n="339">While yet his axe rings on the primal woods ,</l>
      <l n="340">The shrieks of engines rushing o'er the wastes ;</l>
      <l n="341">Nor parts his kind to hew his fortunes out .</l>
      <l n="342">And as one drop glides down the unknown rock</l>
      <l n="343">And the bright-threaded stream leaps after it ,</l>
      <l n="344">With welded billions , so the settler finds</l>
      <l n="345">His solitary footsteps beaten out ,</l>
      <l n="346">With the quick rush of panting , human waves</l>
      <l n="347">Upheav 'd by throbs of angry poverty ;</l>
      <l n="348">And driven by keen blasts of hunger , from</l>
      <l n="349">Their native strands — so stern , so dark , so dear !</l>
      <l n="350">O , then , to see the troubl 'd , groaning waves ,</l>
      <l n="351">Throb down to peace in kindly , valley beds ;</l>
      <l n="352">Their turbid bosoms clearing in the calm</l>
      <l n="353">Of sun-ey 'd Plenty — till the stars and moon ,</l>
      <l n="354">The blessed sun himself , has leave to shine</l>
      <l n="355">And laugh in their dark hearts ! So shanties grew</l>
      <l n="356">Other than his amid the blacken 'd stumps ;</l>
      <l n="357">And children ran , with little twigs and leaves</l>
      <l n="358">And flung them , shouting , on the forest pyres ,</l>
      <l n="359">Where burn 'd the forest kings — and in the glow</l>
      <l n="360">Paus 'd men and women when the day was done .</l>
      <l n="361">There the lean weaver ground anew his axe ,</l>
      <l n="362">Nor backward look 'd upon the vanish 'd loom ,</l>
      <l n="363">But forward to the ploughing of his fields ;</l>
      <l n="364">And to the rose of Plenty in the cheeks .</l>
      <l n="365">Of wife and children — nor heeded much the pangs</l>
      <l n="366">Of the rous 'd muscles tuning to new work .</l>
      <l n="367">The pallid clerk look 'd on his blister 'd palms</l>
      <l n="368">And sigh 'd and smil 'd , but girded up his loins</l>
      <l n="369">And found new vigour as he felt new hope .</l>
      <l n="370">The lab'rer with train 'd muscles , grim and grave ,</l>
      <l n="371">Look 'd at the ground and wonder 'd in his soul ,</l>
      <l n="372">What joyous anguish stirr 'd his darken 'd heart ,</l>
      <l n="373">At the mere look of the familiar soil ,</l>
      <l n="374">And found his answer in the words — “ Mine own ! ”</l>
      <l n="375">Then came smooth-coated men , with eager eyes ,</l>
      <l n="376">And talk 'd of steamers on the cliff-bound lakes ;</l>
      <l n="377">And iron tracks across the prairie lands ;</l>
      <l n="378">And mills to crush the quartz of wealthy hills ;</l>
      <l n="379">And mills to saw the great , wide-arm 'd trees ;</l>
      <l n="380">And mills to grind the singing stream of grain ;</l>
      <l n="381">And with such busy clamour mingled still</l>
      <l n="382">The throbbing music of the bold , bright Axe —</l>
      <l n="383">The steel tongue of the Present , and the wail</l>
      <l n="384">Of falling forests — voices of the Past .</l>
      <l n="385">Max , social-soul 'd , and with his practised thews ,</l>
      <l n="386">Was happy , boy-like , thinking much of Kate ,</l>
      <l n="387">And speaking of her to the women-folk ;</l>
      <l n="388">Who , mostly , happy in new honeymoons</l>
      <l n="389">Of hope themselves , were ready still to hear</l>
      <l n="390">The thrice told tale of Katie 's sunny eyes</l>
      <l n="391">And Katie 's yellow hair , and household ways :</l>
      <l n="392">And heard so often , “ There shall stand our home —</l>
      <l n="393">“ On yonder slope , with vines about the door ! ”</l>
      <l n="394">That the good wives were almost made to see</l>
      <l n="395">The snowy walls , deep porches , and the gleam</l>
      <l n="396">Of Katie 's garments flitting through the rooms ;</l>
      <l n="397">And the black slope all bristling with burn 'd stumps</l>
      <l n="398">Was known amongst them all as “ Max 's House . ”</l>

     <lg type="stanza" n="9">
      <l n="411">The great farm house of Malcolm Graem stood</l>
      <l n="412">Square shoulder 'd and peak roof 'd upon a hill ,</l>
      <l n="413">With many windows looking everywhere ;</l>
      <l n="414">So that no distant meadow might lie hid ,</l>
      <l n="415">Nor corn-field hide its gold — nor lowing herd</l>
      <l n="416">Browse in far pastures , out of Malcolm 's ken .</l>
      <l n="417">He lov 'd to sit , grim , grey , and somewhat stern ,</l>
      <l n="418">And thro ’ the smoke-clouds from his short clay pipe</l>
      <l n="419">Look out upon his riches ; while his thoughts</l>
      <l n="420">Swung back and forth between the bleak , stern past ,</l>
      <l n="421">And the near future , for his life had come</l>
      <l n="422">To that close balance , when , a pendulum ,</l>
      <l n="423">The memory swings between me “ Then ” and “ Now ” ;</l>
      <l n="424">His seldom speech ran thus two diff'rent ways :</l>
      <l n="425">“ When I was but a laddie , this I did ” ;</l>
      <l n="426">Or , “ Katie , in the Fall I 'll see to build</l>
      <l n="427">“ Such fences or such sheds about the place ;</l>
      <l n="428">“ And next year , please the Lord , another barn . ”</l>
      <l n="429">Katie 's gay garden foam 'd about the walls ,</l>
      <l n="430">‘ Leagur 'd the prim-cut modern sills , and rush 'd</l>
      <l n="431">Up the stone walls — and broke on the peak 'd roof .</l>
      <l n="432">And Katie 's lawn was like a Poet 's sward ,</l>
      <l n="433">Velvet and sheer and di'monded with dew ;</l>
      <l n="434">For such as win their wealth most aptly take</l>
      <l n="435">Smooth , urban ways and blend them with their own ;</l>
      <l n="436">And Katie 's dainty raiment was as fine</l>
      <l n="437">As the smooth , silken petals of the rose ;</l>
      <l n="438">And her light feet , her nimble mind and voice ,</l>
      <l n="439">In city schools had learn 'd the city 's ways ,</l>
      <l n="440">And grafts upon the healthy , lonely vine</l>
      <l n="441">They shone , eternal blossoms ‘ mid the fruit .</l>
      <l n="442">For Katie had her sceptre in her hand</l>
      <l n="443">And wielded it right queenly there and here ,</l>
      <l n="444">In dairy , store-room , kitchen — ev'ry spot</l>
      <l n="445">Where women 's ways were needed on the place .</l>
      <l n="446">And Malcolm took her through his mighty fields ,</l>
      <l n="447">And taught her lore about the change of crops ;</l>
      <l n="448">And how to see a handsome furrow plough 'd ;</l>
      <l n="449">And how to choose the cattle for the mart ;</l>
      <l n="450">And how to know a fair day 's work when done ;</l>
      <l n="451">And where to plant young orchards ; for he said ,</l>
      <l n="452">“ God sent a lassie , but I need a son —</l>
      <l n="453">“ Bethankit for His mercies all the same . ”</l>
      <l n="454">And Katie , when he said it , thought of Max —</l>
      <l n="455">Who had been gone two winters and two springs ,</l>
      <l n="456">And sigh 'd , and thought , “ Would he not be your son ? ”</l>
      <l n="457">But all in silence , for she had too much</l>
      <l n="458">Of the firm will of Malcolm in her soul</l>
      <l n="459">To think of shaking that deep-rooted rock ;</l>
      <l n="460">But hop 'd the crystal current of his love</l>
      <l n="461">For his one child , increasing day by day ,</l>
      <l n="462">Might fret with silver lip , until it wore</l>
      <l n="463">Such channels thro ’ the rock , that some slight stroke</l>
      <l n="464">Of circumstance might crumble down the stone .</l>
      <l n="465">The wooer , too , had come , Max prophesied ;</l>
      <l n="466">Reputed wealthy ; with the azure eyes</l>
      <l n="467">And Saxon-gilded locks — the fair , clear face ,</l>
      <l n="468">And stalwart form that most women love .</l>
      <l n="469">And with the jewels of some virtues set</l>
      <l n="470">On his broad brow . With fires within his soul</l>
      <l n="471">He had the wizard skill to fetter down</l>
      <l n="472">To that mere pink , poetic , nameless glow ,</l>
      <l n="473">That need not fright a flake of snow away —</l>
      <l n="474">But if unloos 'd , could melt an adverse rock</l>
      <l n="475">Marrow 'd with iron , frowning in his way .</l>
      <l n="476">And Malcolm balanc 'd him by day and night ;</l>
      <l n="477">And with his grey-ey 'd shrewdness partly saw</l>
      <l n="478">He was not one for Kate ; but let him come ,</l>
      <l n="479">And in chance moments thought : “ Well , let it be —</l>
      <l n="480">“ They make a bonnie pair — he knows the ways</l>
      <l n="481">“ Of men and things : can hold the gear I give ,</l>
      <l n="482">“ And , if the lassie wills it , let it be . ”</l>
      <l n="483">And then , upstarting from his midnight sleep ,</l>
      <l n="484">With hair erect and sweat upon his brow ,</l>
      <l n="485">Such as no labor e'er had beaded there ;</l>
      <l n="486">Would cry aloud , wide-staring thro ’ the dark —</l>
      <l n="487">“ Nay , nay ; she shall not wed him — rest in peace . ”</l>
      <l n="488">Then fully waking , grimly laugh and say :</l>
      <l n="489">“ Why did I speak and answer when none spake ? ”</l>
      <l n="490">But still lie staring , wakeful , through the shades ;</l>
      <l n="491">List'ning to the silence , and beating still</l>
      <l n="492">The ball of Alfred 's merits to and fro —</l>
      <l n="493">Saying , between the silent arguments :</l>
      <l n="494">“ But would the mother like it , could she know ?</l>
      <l n="495">“ I would there was a way to ring a lad</l>

      <l n="1035">“ Max Gordon ? Yes . Was he a friend of yours ? ”</l>
      <l n="1036">“ No friend of mine , but of the lassie 's here —</l>

      <l n="1042">O , blush that stole from Katie 's swelling heart ,</l>
      <l n="1043">And with its hot rose brought the happy dew</l>
      <l n="1044">Into her hidden eyes . “ Aye , aye ! is that the way ? ”</l>

      <l n="1046">“ In that he is a somewhat simple soul ,</l>
      <l n="1047">“ Why , I suppose he loves — ” he paused , and Kate</l>
      <l n="1048">Look 'd up with two “ forget-me-nots ” for eyes ,</l>
      <l n="1049">With eager jewels in their centres set</l>
      <l n="1050">Of happy , happy tears , and Alfred 's heart</l>
      <l n="1051">Became a closer marble than before .</l>
      <l n="1052">“ — Why I suppose he loves — his lawful wife . ”</l>
      <l n="1053">“ His wife ! his wife ! ” said Malcolm , in a maze ,</l>
      <l n="1054">And laid his heavy hand on Katie 's head ;</l>
      <l n="1055">“ Did you play me false , my little lass ?</l>
      <l n="1056">“ Speak and I 'll pardon ! Katie , lassie , what ? ”</l>
      <l n="1057">“ He has a wife , ” said Alfred , “ lithe and bronz 'd ,</l>
      <l n="1058">“ An Indian woman , comelier than her kind ;</l>
      <l n="1059">“ And on her knee a child with yellow locks ,</l>
      <l n="1060">“ And lake-like eyes of mystic Indian brown .</l>

      <l n="1062">“ False , false ! ” said Katie , lifting up her head .</l>
      <l n="1063">“ O , you know not the Max my father means ! ”</l>
      <l n="1064">“ He came from yonder farm-house on the slope . ”</l>
      <l n="1065">“ Some other Max — we speak not of the same . ”</l>
      <l n="1066">“ He has a red mark on his temple set . ”</l>
      <l n="1067">“ It matters not — ‘ tis not the Max we know . ”</l>
      <l n="1068">“ He wears a turquoise ring slung round his neck . ”</l>
      <l n="1069">“ And many wear them — they are common stones . ”</l>
      <l n="1070">“ His mother 's ring — her name was Helen Wynde . ”</l>
      <l n="1071">“ And there be many Helens who have sons . ”</l>
      <l n="1072">“ O Katie , credit me — it is the man . ”</l>
      <l n="1073">“ O not the man ! Why , you have never told</l>
      <l n="1074">“ Us of the true soul that the true Max has ;</l>
      <l n="1075">“ The Max we know has such a soul , I know . ”</l>
      <l n="1076">“ How know you that , my foolish little lass ? ”</l>
      <l n="1077">Said Malcolm , a storm of anger bound</l>
      <l n="1078">Within his heart , like Samson with green withs —</l>
      <l n="1079">“ Belike it is the false young cur we know ! ”</l>
      <l n="1080">“ No , no , ” said Katie , simply , and low-voic 'd ;</l>
      <l n="1081">“ If he were traitor I must needs be false ,</l>
      <l n="1082">“ For long ago love melted our two hearts .</l>
      <l n="1083">“ And time has moulded those two hearts in one ,</l>
      <l n="1084">“ And he is true since I am faithful still . ”</l>
      <l n="1085">She rose and parted , trembling as she went ,</l>
      <l n="1086">Feeling the following steel of Alfred 's eyes ,</l>
      <l n="1087">And with the icy hand of scorn 'd mistrust</l>
      <l n="1088">Searching about the pulses of her heart —</l>

      <l n="1341">“ That she may yield her increase willingly .</l>
      <l n="1342">“ I would not change these wild and rocking woods ,</l>
      <l n="1343">“ Dotted by little homes of unbark 'd trees ,</l>
      <l n="1344">“ Where dwell the fleers from the waves of want ,—</l>
      <l n="1345">“ For the smooth sward of selfish Eden bowers ,</l>

    <head>THE WOOING OF GHEEZIS .</head>

     <l n="4">Curl 'd like to smoke about the mountain tops .</l>
     <l n="5">Gheezis look 'd from his wigwam , blue as little pools</l>
     <l n="6">Drained from the restless mother-wave , that lay</l>
     <l n="7">Dreaming in golden hollows of her sands ;</l>
     <l n="8">And deck 'd his yellow locks with feath'ry clouds ,</l>
     <l n="9">And took his pointed arrows and so stoop 'd</l>
     <l n="10">And leaning with his red hands on the hills ,</l>
     <l n="11">Look 'd with long glances all along the earth .</l>
     <l n="12">“ Mudjekeewis , West-Wind , in amongst the forest ,</l>

     <l n="25">Gheezis , with long , golden fingers tore the grape-vine ,</l>
     <l n="26">But Segwun laughed upon him from behind</l>
     <l n="27">A maple , shaking little leaves of gold fresh-budded .</l>
     <l n="28">“ Gheezis , where are thy feet , O sun , O chief ? ”</l>

     <l n="31">The red chief Gheezis swift ran down the hills ,</l>
     <l n="32">And as he ran the pools and watercourses</l>
     <l n="33">Snatch 'd at his yellow hair ; the thickets caught</l>
     <l n="34">Its tendrils on their brambles ; and the buds</l>
     <l n="35">That Segwun dropp 'd , opened as they touched .</l>
     <l n="36">His moccasins were flame , his wampum gold ;</l>
     <l n="37">His plumes were clouds white as the snow , and red</l>
     <l n="38">As Sumach in the moon of falling leaves .</l>
     <l n="39">He slipp 'd beside the maple , Segwun laugh 'd .</l>
     <l n="40">“ O Gheezis , I am hid amid the lily-pads ,</l>
     <l n="41">“ And thou hast no canoe to seek me there ; farewell ! ”</l>
     <l n="42">“ I see thine eyes , O Segwun , laugh behind the buds ;</l>
     <l n="43">“ The Manitou is love , and gives me love , and love</l>
     <l n="44">“ Gives all of power . ” His moccasins wide laid</l>
     <l n="45">Red tracks upon the waves : When Segwun leap 'd</l>
     <l n="46">Gold-red and laughing from the lily-pads ,</l>
     <l n="47">To flit before him like a fire-fly , she found</l>
     <l n="48">The golden arms of Gheezis round her cast , the buds</l>
     <l n="49">Burst into flower in her hands , and all the earth</l>
     <l n="50">Laughing where Gheezis look 'd ; and Mudjekeewis ,</l>
     <l n="51">Heart friend of Gheezis , laugh 'd , “ Now life is come</l>

    <head>CURTIUS .</head>
     <l n="1">How spake the Oracle , my Curtius , how ?</l>
     <l n="2">Methought , while on the shadow 'd terraces</l>
     <l n="3">I walked and looked towards Rome , an echo came ,</l>
     <l n="4">Of legion wails , blent into one deep cry .</l>
     <l n="5">“ O , Jove ! ” I thought , “ the Oracles have said ;</l>
     <l n="6">And saying , touched some swiftly answering chord ,</l>
     <l n="7">Gen'ral to ev'ry soul . ” And then my heart</l>
     <l n="8">( I being here alone ) beat strangely loud ;</l>
     <l n="9">Responsive to the cry — and my still soul ,</l>
     <l n="10">Inform 'd me thus : “ Not such a harmony</l>
     <l n="11">Could spring from aught within the souls of men ,</l>
     <l n="12">But that which is most common to all souls .</l>
     <l n="13">Lo ! that is sorrow ! ” “ Nay , Curtius , I could smile ,</l>
     <l n="14">To tell thee as I listen 'd to the cry ,</l>
     <l n="15">How on the silver flax which blew about</l>
     <l n="16">The ivory distaff in my languid hand ,</l>
     <l n="17">I found large tears ; such big and rounded drops</l>
     <l n="18">As gather thro ’ dark nights on cypress boughs ,</l>
     <l n="19">And I was sudden anger 'd , for I thought :</l>
     <l n="20">“ Why should a gen'ral wail come home to me</l>
     <l n="21">With such vibration in my trembling heart ,</l>
     <l n="22">That such great tears should rise and overflow ? ”</l>
     <l n="23">Then shook them on the marble where I pac 'd ;</l>
     <l n="24">Where instantly they vanished in the sun ,</l>
     <l n="25">As di'monds fade in flames , ‘ twas foolish , Curtius !</l>
     <l n="26">And then methought how strange and lone it seem 'd ,</l>
     <l n="27">For till thou cam'st I seem 'd to be alone ,</l>
     <l n="28">On the vin 'd terrace , prison 'd in the gold</l>
     <l n="29">Of that still noontide hour . No widows stole</l>
     <l n="30">Up the snow-glimmering marble of the steps</l>
     <l n="31">To take my alms and bless the Gods and me ;</l>
     <l n="32">No orphans touched the fringes of my robe</l>
     <l n="33">With innocent babe-fingers , nor dropped the gold</l>
     <l n="34">I laid in their soft palms , to laugh , and stroke</l>
     <l n="35">The jewels on my neck , or touch the rose</l>
     <l n="36">Thou sayest , Curtius , lives upon my cheek .</l>
     <l n="37">Perchance all lingered in the Roman streets</l>
     <l n="38">To catch first tidings from the Oracles .</l>
     <l n="39">The very peacocks drows 'd in distant shades ,</l>
     <l n="40">Nor sought my hand for honey 'd cake ; and high</l>
     <l n="41">A hawk sailed blackly in the clear blue sky ,</l>
     <l n="42">And kept my doves from cooing at my feet .</l>
     <l n="43">My lute lay there , bound with the small white buds ,</l>
     <l n="44">Which , laughing this bright morn , thou brought and wreath 'd</l>
     <l n="45">Around it as I sang — but with that wail</l>
     <l n="46">Dying across the vines and purple slopes ,</l>
     <l n="47">And breaking on its strings , I did not care</l>
     <l n="48">To waken music , nor in truth could force</l>
     <l n="49">My voice or fingers to it , so I stray 'd</l>
     <l n="50">Where hangs thy best loved armour on the wall ,</l>
     <l n="51">And pleased myself by filling it with thee !</l>
     <l n="52">‘ Tis yet the goodliest armour in proud Rome ,</l>
     <l n="53">Say all the armourers ; all Rome and I</l>
     <l n="54">Know thee , the lordliest bearer of a sword .</l>
     <l n="55">Yet , Curtius , stay , there is a rivet lost</l>
     <l n="56">From out the helmet , and a ruby gone</l>
     <l n="57">From the short sword hilt — trifles both which can</l>
     <l n="58">Be righted by to-morrow 's noon — “ to-morrow 's noon ! ”</l>
     <l n="59">Was there a change , my Curtius , in my voice</l>
     <l n="60">When spake I those three words : “ to-morrow 's noon ? ”</l>
     <l n="61">O , I am full of dreams — methought there was .</l>
     <l n="62">“ Why , love , how darkly gaze thine eyes in mine !</l>
     <l n="63">If lov 'd I dismal thoughts I well could deem</l>
     <l n="64">Thou saw'st not the blue of my fond eyes ,</l>
     <l n="65">But looked between the lips of that dread pit —</l>
     <l n="66">O , Jove ! to name it seems to curse the air</l>
     <l n="67">With chills of death — we 'll not speak of it , Curtius .</l>
     <l n="68">When I had dimm 'd thy shield with kissing it ,</l>
     <l n="69">I went between the olives to the stalls ;</l>
     <l n="70">White Audax neigh 'd out to me as I came ,</l>
     <l n="71">As I had been Hippona to his eyes ;</l>
     <l n="72">New dazzling from the one , small , mystic cloud</l>
     <l n="73">That like a silver chariot floated low</l>
     <l n="74">In the ripe blue of noon , and seem 'd to pause ,</l>
     <l n="75">Stay 'd by the hilly round of yon aged tree .</l>
     <l n="76">He stretch 'd the ivory arch of his vast neck ,</l>
     <l n="77">Smiting sharp thunders from the marble floor</l>
     <l n="78">With hoofs impatient of a peaceful earth ;</l>
     <l n="79">Shook the long silver of his burnish 'd mane ,</l>
     <l n="80">Until the sunbeams smote it into light ,</l>
     <l n="81">Such as a comet trails across the sky .</l>
     <l n="82">I love him , Curtius ! Such magnanimous fires</l>
     <l n="83">Leap from his eyes . I do truly think</l>
     <l n="84">That with thee seated on him , thy strong knees</l>
     <l n="85">Against his sides — the bridle in his jaws</l>
     <l n="86">In thy lov 'd hand , to pleasure thee he 'd spring</l>
     <l n="87">Sheer from the verge of Earth into the breast</l>
     <l n="88">Of Death and Chaos — of Death and Chaos !—</l>
     <l n="89">What omens seem to strike my soul to-day ?</l>
     <l n="90">What is there in this blossom hour should knit</l>
     <l n="91">An omen in with ev'ry simple word ?</l>
     <l n="92">Should make yon willows with their hanging locks</l>
     <l n="93">Dusk sybils , mutt'ring sorrows to the air ?</l>
     <l n="94">The roses clamb'ring round yon marble Pan ,</l>
     <l n="95">Wave like red banners floating o'er the dead ?</l>
     <l n="96">The dead — there ‘ tis again . My Curtius , come</l>
     <l n="97">And thou shalt tell me of the Oracles</l>
     <l n="98">And what sent hither that long cry of woe .</l>
     <l n="99">Yet wait , yet wait , I care not much to hear .</l>
     <l n="100">While on thy charger 's throbbing neck I lean 'd ,</l>
     <l n="101">Romeward there pass 'd across the violet slopes ,</l>
     <l n="102">Five sacrificial bulls , with silver hides ,</l>
     <l n="103">And horns as cusp 'd and white as Dian 's bow ,</l>
     <l n="104">And lordly breasts which laid the honey 'd thyme</l>
     <l n="105">Into long swarths , whence smoke of yellow bees</l>
     <l n="106">Rose up in puffs , dispersing as it rose ,</l>
     <l n="107">For the great temple they ; and as they pass 'd</l>
     <l n="108">With quiet gait , I heard their drivers say :</l>
     <l n="109">The bulls were for the Altars , when should come</l>
     <l n="110">Word from the Oracles , as to the Pit ,</l>
     <l n="111">O , Curtius , Curtius , in my soul I see</l>
     <l n="112">How black and fearful is its glutton throat ;</l>
     <l n="113">I will not look !</l>
     <l n="114">O , Soul , be blind and see not ! Then the men</l>
     <l n="115">Wav 'd their long goads , still juicy from the vine ,</l>
     <l n="116">And plum 'd with bronzy leaves , and each to each ,</l>
     <l n="117">Showed the sleek beauty of the rounded sides ,</l>
     <l n="118">The mighty curving of the lordly breasts ,</l>
     <l n="119">The level lines of backs , the small , fine heads ,</l>
     <l n="120">And laugh 'd and said , “ The Gods will have it thus ,</l>
     <l n="121">The choicest of the earth for sacrifice ;</l>
     <l n="122">Let it be man , or maid , or lowing bull ! ”</l>
     <l n="123">Where lay the witchcraft in their clownish words ,</l>
     <l n="124">To shake my heart ? I know not ; but it thrill 'd ,</l>
     <l n="125">As Daphne 's leaves , thrill to a wind so soft ,</l>
     <l n="126">One might not feel it on the open palm ;</l>
     <l n="127">I cannot choose but laugh — for what have I</l>
     <l n="128">To do with altars and with sacrifice ?</l>

     <l n="186">“ On some swift message from his throne of light ,</l>
     <l n="187">“ The ready heart may wish , and the ripe fruit —</l>
     <l n="188">“ Fulfilment — drop into the eager palm ? ”</l>
     <l n="189">“ Then let us watch for such a star , ” quoth I .</l>
     <l n="190">“ Nay , love , ” she said , “ ‘ Tis but an idle tale . ”</l>
     <l n="191">But some swift feeling smote upon her brow</l>
     <l n="192">A rosy shadow . I turn 'd and watch 'd the sky —</l>
     <l n="193">Calmly the cohorts of the night swept on ,</l>
     <l n="194">Led by the wide-wing 'd vesper ; and against the moon</l>
     <l n="195">Where low her globe trembl 'd upon the edge</l>
     <l n="196">Of the wide amethyst that clearly paved</l>
     <l n="197">The dreamy sapphire of the night , there lay</l>
     <l n="198">The jetty spars of some tall ship , that look 'd</l>
     <l n="199">The night 's device upon his ripe-red shield .</l>
     <l n="200">And suddenly down towards the moon there ran —</l>
     <l n="201">From some high space deep-veil 'd in solemn blue ,</l>
     <l n="202">A little star , a point of trembling gold ,</l>
     <l n="203">Gone swift as seen . “ My wishing-star , ” quoth I ,</l>
     <l n="204">“ Shall tell my wish ? Did'st note that little star ?</l>
     <l n="205">“ Its brightness died not , it but disappeared ,</l>
     <l n="206">“ To whirl undim 'd thro ’ space . I wish 'd our love</l>
     <l n="207">“ Might blot the ‘ All is vanity ’ from this brief life ,</l>
     <l n="208">“ Burning brightly as that star and winging on</l>
     <l n="209">“ Thro ’ unseen space of veil 'd Eternity ,</l>
     <l n="210">“ Brightened by Immortality — not lost . ”</l>
     <l n="211">“ Awful and sweet the wish ! ” she said , and so —</l>
     <l n="212">We rested in the silence of content .</l>

    <head>MY IRISH LOVE .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Beside the saffron of a curtain , lit</l>
     <l n="2">With broidered flowers , below a golden fringe</l>
     <l n="3">That on her silver shoulder made a glow ,</l>
     <l n="4">Like the sun kissing lilies in the dawn ;</l>
     <l n="5">She sat — my Irish love — slim , light and tall .</l>
     <l n="6">Between his mighty paws her stag-hound held ,</l>
     <l n="7">( Love-jealous he ) the foam of her pale robes ,</l>
     <l n="8">Rare laces of her land , and his red eyes ,</l>
     <l n="9">Half lov 'd me , grown familiar at her side ,</l>
     <l n="10">Half pierc 'd me , doubting my soul 's right to stand</l>
     <l n="11">His lady 's wooer in the courts of Love .</l>
     <l n="12">Above her , knitted silver , fell a web</l>
     <l n="13">Of light from waxen tapers slipping down ,</l>
     <l n="14">First to the wide-winged star of em'ralds set</l>
     <l n="15">On the black crown with its blue burnish 'd points</l>
     <l n="16">Of raven light ; thence , fonder , to the cheek</l>
     <l n="17">O'er which flew drifts of rose-leaves wild and rich ,</l>
     <l n="18">With lilied pauses in the wine-red flight ;</l>
     <l n="19">For when I whispered , like a wind in June ,</l>
     <l n="20">My whisper toss 'd the roses to and fro</l>
     <l n="21">In her dear face , and when I paus 'd they lay</l>
     <l n="22">Still in her heart . Then lower fell the light .</l>
     <l n="23">A silver chisel cutting the round arm</l>
     <l n="24">Clear from the gloom ; and dropped like dew</l>
     <l n="25">On the crisp lily , di'mond clasp 'd , that lay</l>
     <l n="26">In happy kinship on her pure , proud breast ,</l>
     <l n="27">And thence it sprang like Cupid , nimble-wing 'd ,</l>
     <l n="28">To the quaint love-ring on her finger bound</l>
     <l n="29">And set it blazing like a watch-fire , lit</l>
     <l n="30">To guard a treasure . Then up sprang the flame</l>
     <l n="31">Mad for her eyes , but those grey worlds were deep</l>
     <l n="32">In seas of native light : and when I spoke</l>
     <l n="33">They wander 'd shining to the shining moon</l>
     <l n="34">That gaz 'd at us between the parted folds</l>
     <l n="35">Of yellow , rich with gold and daffodils ,</l>
     <l n="36">Dropping her silver cloak on Innisfail .</l>
     <l n="37">O worlds , those eyes ! there Laughter lightly toss 'd</l>
     <l n="38">His gleaming cymbals ; Large and most divine</l>
     <l n="39">Pity stood in their crystal doors with hands</l>
     <l n="40">All generous outspread ; in their pure depths</l>
     <l n="41">Mov 'd Modesty , chaste goddess , snow-white of brow ,</l>
     <l n="42">And shining , vestal limbs ; rose-fronted stood</l>
     <l n="43">Blushing , yet strong ; young Courage , knightly in</l>
     <l n="44">His virgin arms , and simple , russet Truth</l>
     <l n="45">Play 'd like a child amongst her tender thoughts —</l>

     <l n="61">But I would have her smile ripe for me then ,</l>
     <l n="62">Swift treasure of a moment — so I laid</l>
     <l n="63">Between her palms a little simple thing ,</l>
     <l n="64">A golden heart , grav 'd with my name alone ,</l>
     <l n="65">And round it , twining close , small shamrocks link 'd</l>
     <l n="66">Of gold , mere gold : no jewels made it rich ,</l>
     <l n="67">Until twin di'monds shatter 'd from her eyes</l>
     <l n="68">And made the red gold rare . “ True Knight , ” she said ,</l>
     <l n="69">“ Your English heart with Irish shamrocks bound ! ”</l>
     <l n="70">“ A golden prophet of eternal truth , ”</l>
     <l n="71">I said , and kissed the roses of her palms ,</l>
     <l n="72">And then the shy , bright roses of her lips ,</l>
     <l n="73">And all the jealous jewels shone forgot</l>
     <l n="74">In necklace and tiara , as I clasp 'd</l>
     <l n="75">The gold heart and its shamrocks round her neck .</l>
     <l n="76">My fair , pure soul ! My noble Irish love !</l>
