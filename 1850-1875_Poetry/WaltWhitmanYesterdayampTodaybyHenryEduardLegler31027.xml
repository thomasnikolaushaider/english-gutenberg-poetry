    <docTitle><titlePart>WALT WHITMAN Yesterday &amp; Today BY HENRY EDUARD LEGLER</titlePart></docTitle>
    <docDate>CHICAGO BROTHERS OF THE BOOK<date>1916</date></docDate>
    <docImprint>COPYRIGHT<date>1916</date>BY THE BROTHERS OF THE BOOK The edition of this book consists of six hundred copies on this Fabriano hand-made paper , and the type distributed . This copy is Number 2 TO DR. MAX HENIUS CONSISTENT HATER OF SHAMS ARDENT LOVER OF ALL OUTDOORS AND GENEROUS GIVER OF SELF IN GENUINE FELLOWSHIP THIS BOOK IS DEDICATED Walt Whitman : Yesterday &amp; Today I On a day about mid-year in<date>1855</date>, the conventional literary world was startled into indecorous behavior by the unannounced appearance of a thin quarto sheaf of poems , in form and in tone unlike anything of precedent issue . It was called Leaves of Grass , and there were but twelve poems in the volume . No author 's name appeared upon the title page , the separate poems bore no captions , there was no imprint of publisher . A steel engraving of a man presumably between thirty and forty years of age , coatless , shirt flaringly open at the neck , and a copyright notice identifying Walter Whitman with the publication , furnished the only clues . Uncouth in size , atrociously printed , and shockingly frank in the language employed , the volume evoked such a tirade of rancorous condemnation as perhaps bears no parallel in the history of letters . From contemporary criticisms might be compiled an Anthology of Anathema comparable to Wagner 's Schimpf-Lexicon , or the Dictionary of Abuse suggested by William Archer for Henrik Ibsen . Some of the striking adjectives and phrases employed in print would include the following , as applied either to the verses or their author : The slop-bucket of Walt Whitman . A belief in the preciousness of filth . Entirely bestial . Nastiness and animal insensibility to shame . Noxious weeds . Impious and obscene . Disgusting burlesque . Broken out of Bedlam . Libidinousness and swell of self-applause . Defilement . Crazy outbreak of conceit and vulgarity . Ithyphallic audacity . Gross indecency . Sunken sensualist . Rotten garbage of licentious thoughts . Roots like a pig . Rowdy Knight Errant . A poet whose indecencies stink in the nostrils . Its liberty is the wildest license ; its love the essence of the lowest lust ! Priapus — worshipping obscenity . Rant and rubbish . Linguistic silliness . Inhumanly insolent . Apotheosis of Sweat . Mouthings of a mountebank . Venomously malignant . Pretentious twaddle . Degraded helot of literature . His work , like a maniac 's robe , bedizened with fluttering tags of a thousand colors . Roaming , like a drunken satyr , with inflamed blood , through every field of lascivious thought . Muck of abomination . A few quotations from the press of this period will serve to indicate the general tenor of comment : “ The book might pass for merely hectoring and ludicrous , if it were not something a great deal more offensive , ” observed the Christian Examiner (<settlement>Boston</settlement>,<date>1856</date>) . “ It openly deifies the bodily organs , senses , and appetites in terms that admit of no double sense . The author is ‘ one of the roughs , a Kosmos , disorderly , fleshly , sensual , divine inside and out . The scent of these armpits an aroma finer than prayer . ’ He leaves ‘ washes and razors for foofoos , ’ thinks the talk about virtue and vice only ‘ blurt , ’ he being above and indifferent to both of them . These quotations are made with cautious delicacy . We pick our way as cleanly as we can between other passages which are more detestable . ” In columns of bantering comment , after parodying his style of all-inclusiveness , the<country>United States</country>Review (<date>1855</date>) characterizes Walt Whitman thus : “ No skulker or tea-drinking poet is Walt Whitman . He will bring poems to fill the days and nights — fit for men and women with the attributes of throbbing blood and flesh . The body , he teaches , is beautiful . Sex is also beautiful . Are you to be put down , he seems to ask , to that shallow level of literature and conversation that stops a man 's recognizing the delicious pleasure of his sex , or a woman hers ? Nature he proclaims inherently clean . Sex will not be put aside ; it is the great ordination of the universe . He works the muscle of the male and the teeming fibre of the female throughout his writings , as wholesome realities , impure only by deliberate intention and effort . To men and women , he says , you can have healthy and powerful breeds of children on no less terms than these of mine . Follow me , and there shall be taller and richer crops of humanity on the earth . ” From Studies among the Leaves , printed in the Crayon (<settlement>New York</settlement>,<date>1856</date>) , this extract may be taken : “ With a wonderful vigor of thought and intensity of perception , a power , indeed , not often found , Leaves of Grass has no identity , no concentration , no purpose — it is barbarous , undisciplined , like the poetry of a half-civilized people , and as a whole useless , save to those miners of thought who prefer the metal in its unworked state . ” The<settlement>New York</settlement>Daily Times (<date>1856</date>) asks : “ What Centaur have we here , half man , half beast , neighing defiance to all the world ? What conglomerate of thought is this before us , with insolence , philosophy , tenderness , blasphemy , beauty , and gross indecency tumbling in drunken confusion through the pages ? Who is this arrogant young man who proclaims himself the Poet of the time , and who roots like a pig among a rotten garbage of licentious thoughts ? ” “ Other poets , ” notes a writer in the Brooklyn Daily Eagle (<date>1856</date>) , “ other poets celebrate great events , personages , romances , wars , loves , passions , the victories and power of their country , or some real or imagined incident — and polish their work , and come to conclusions , and satisfy the reader . This poet celebrates natural propensities in himself ; and that is the way he celebrates all . He comes to no conclusions , and does not satisfy the reader . He certainly leaves him what the serpent left the woman and the man , the taste of the Paradise tree of the knowledge of good and evil , never to be erased again . ” “ He stalks among the dapper gentlemen of this generation like a drunken Hercules amid the dainty dancers , ” suggested the Christian Spiritualist (<date>1856</date>) . “ The book abounds in passages that cannot be quoted in drawing rooms , and expressions that fall upon ears polite with a terrible dissonance . ” Nor was savage criticism in the years<date>1855</date>and<date>1856</date>limited to this side of the Atlantic . The<settlement>London</settlement>Critic , in a caustic review , found this the mildest comment that Whitman 's verse warranted : “ Walt Whitman gives us slang in the place of melody , and rowdyism in the place of regularity . * * * Walt Whitman libels the highest type of humanity , and calls his free speech the true utterance of a man ; we who may have been misdirected by civilization , call it the expression of a beast . ” Noisy as was this babel of discordant voices , one friendly greeting rang clear . Leaves of Grass had but just come from the press , when Ralph Waldo Emerson , from his home in Concord , under date of July 21 ,<date>1855</date>, wrote to the author in genuine fellowship : “ I give you joy of your free and brave thought . I have great joy in it . I find incomparable things said incomparably well , as they must be . I find the courage of treatment which so delights us , and which large perception only can inspire . “ I greet you at the beginning of a great career , which yet must have had a long foreground somewhere , for such a start . I rubbed my eyes a little to see if this sunbeam were no illusion ; but the solid sense of the book is a sober certainty . It has the best merits , namely , of fortifying and encouraging . ” Tracing the popular estimates of Walt Whitman through the next five years , expressions of unmeasured disapproval similar to those quoted may be found in periodicals and in the daily press , with here and there grudging admission that despite unseemly tendencies , there is evident originality and even genius in the pages of this unusual book . In a comparatively temperate review , August 4 ,<date>1860</date>, the Cosmopolite , of<settlement>Boston</settlement>, while deploring that nature is treated here without fig-leaves , declares the style wonderfully idiomatic and graphic , adding : “ In his frenzy , in the fire of his inspiration , are fused and poured out together elements hitherto considered antagonistic in poetry — passion , arrogance , animality , philosophy , brag , humility , rowdyism , spirituality , laughter , tears , together with the most ardent and tender love , the most comprehensive human sympathy which ever radiated its divine glow through the pages of poems . ” A contemporary of this date , the<settlement>Boston</settlement>Post , found nothing to commend . “ Grass , ” said the writer , making the title of the book his text , “ grass is the gift of God for the healthy sustenance of his creatures , and its name ought not to be desecrated by being so improperly bestowed upon these foul and rank leaves of the poison-plants of egotism , irreverance , and of lust , run rampant and holding high revel in its shame . ” And the<settlement>London</settlement>Lancet , July 7 ,<date>1860</date>, comments in this wise : “ Of all the writers we have ever perused , Walt Whitman is the most silly , the most blasphemous , and the most disgusting . If we can think of any stronger epithets , we will print them in a second edition . ” II What were these poems which excited such vitriolic epithets ? Taking both the editions of<date>1855</date>and of the year following , and indeed including all of the four hundred poems bearing Whitman 's authorship in the three-quarters of a half-century during which his final volume was in the making , scarcely half a dozen poems can be found which could give offense to the most prudish persons . Nearly all of these have been grouped , with some others , under the general sub-title Children of Adam . There are poems which excite the risibles of some readers , there are poems which read like the lists of a mail-order house , and others which appear in spots to have been copied bodily from a gazetteer . These , however , are more likely to provoke good-natured banter than violent denunciatory passion . Even Ralph Waldo Emerson , whose generous greeting and meed of praise in the birth-year of Leaves of Grass will be recalled , in sending a copy of it to Carlyle in<date>1860</date>, and commending it to his interest , added : “ And after you have looked into it , if you think , as you may , that it is only an auctioneer 's inventory of a warehouse , you can light your pipe with it . ” Had Whitman omitted the few poems whose titles are given here , doubtless a few readers would have found his formless verses either curious or ludicrous , or merely stupid , and others would have passed them by as unmeriting even casual attention . The poems which are chiefly responsible for a controversy which raged for half a century , are these : I sing the body electric . A woman waits for me . To a common prostitute . The dalliance of the eagles . Wholly dissociated from the picturesque personality from which the book emanated , Leaves of Grass bears a unique story margined on its pages . The sprawling types whose muddy imprint on the ill-proportioned pages made up the uncouth first edition of the book , were put together by the author 's hands , and the sorry press work was his handiwork as well . The unusual preface and the twelve poems that followed he wrote in the open , while lounging on the wharves , while crossing on ferry-boats , while loitering in the fields , while sitting on the tops of omnibuses . His physical materials were the stubs of pencils , the backs of used envelopes , scraps of paper that easily came to hand . The same open-air workshops and like crude tools of writing he utilized for nearly forty years . During the thirty-seven years that intervened between the first printing of his Leaves and his death in<date>1892</date>, he followed as his chief purpose in life the task he had set himself at the beginning of his serious authorship — the cumulative expression of personality in the larger sense which is manifest in the successive and expanding editions of his Leaves of Grass . That book becomes therefore , a life history . Incompletely as he may have performed this self-imposed task , his own explanation of his purpose may well be accepted as made in good faith . That explanation appears in the preface to the<date>1876</date>edition , and amid the multitude of paper scraps that came into the possession of his executors , following his passing away , may be found similar clues : “ It was originally my intention , after chanting in Leaves of Grass the songs of the body and of existence , to then compose a further , equally-needed volume , based on those convictions of perpetuity and conservation which , enveloping all precedents , make the unseen soul govern absolutely at last . I meant , while in a sort continuing the theme of my first chants , to shift the slides and exhibit the problem and paradox of the same ardent and fully appointed personality entering the sphere of the resistless gravitation of spiritual law , and with cheerful face estimating death , not at all as the cessation , but as somehow what I feel it must be , the entrance upon by far the greater part of existence , and something that life is at least as much for , as it is for itself . ” Too long for repetition here , but important in the same connection for a full understanding of Walt Whitman 's motives , is that Backward Glance O'er Travel 'd Roads , wherein he summed up his work in fourteen pages of prose , and with frank egotism appended this anecdote in a footnote on the first page thereof : “ When Champollion , on his death bed , handed to the printer the revised proof of his Egyptian Grammar , he said gayly , ‘ Be careful of this — it is my carte de visite to posterity . ’ ” Undaunted when ridicule poured over him , evenly tranquil when abuse assailed him , unemotional when praise was lavished upon him , unfalteringly and undeviatingly he pursued his way . The group headings which were added in successive editions of his book , indicate the milestones of his journey from the time when the Song of Myself noted the beginning , till Whispers of Heavenly Death presaged the ending . Familiarity with the main incidents and experiences of his life give to the several annexes , as he was fond of calling the additions that he made to each succeeding issue of his Leaves , the clues of chapter headings : Children of Adam ; Calamus ; Birds of Passage ; Sea-Drift ; By the Roadside ; Drum-Taps ; Autumn Rivulets ; Whispers of Heavenly Death ; Songs of Parting . A check list of his principal editions of Leaves of Grass , with characteristics noted , would serve almost as a chronology of Whitman 's life story .<date>1855</date>— FIRST EDITION . Twelve poems were included in this edition . They are without distinctive titles , though in later issues they appeared with varying titles , those given in the definitive edition being the following : Song of myself . Song for occupations . To think of time . The sleepers . I sing the body electric . Faces . Song of the answerer . Europe . A<settlement>Boston</settlement>ballad . There was a child went forth . My lesson complete . Great are the myths .<date>1856</date>— SECOND EDITION . In this edition , the second , there are thirty-two poems . The poems are given titles , but not the same ones that were finally included .<date>1860</date>— THIRD EDITION . The number of poems is one hundred and fifty-seven .<date>1867</date>— FOURTH EDITION . The poems have grown in number to two hundred and thirty-six . The inclusion here of the war cluster Drum-Taps , and a rearrangement of other clusters , marks this edition as a notable one . Drum-Taps had appeared as a separate volume two years earlier .<date>1871</date>— FIFTH EDITION . A total of two hundred and seventy-three poems are here classified under general titles , including for the first time , Passage to India , and After All Not to Create Only , groups which prior to this date were issued separately .<date>1876</date>— SIXTH EDITION . This issue was intended as a Centennial edition , and it includes Two Rivulets ; there are two hundred and ninety-eight poems .<date>1881</date>— SEVENTH EDITION . Intended as the completion of a design extending over a period of twenty-six years , Whitman had undertaken an extensive revision of what he termed his bible of democracy . There are three hundred and eighteen poems . This is the edition abandoned by the publishers because threatened with prosecution by the district attorney .<date>1889</date>— EIGHTH EDITION . In celebration of the author 's seventieth birthday , a special autograph edition of three hundred copies was issued .<date>1892</date>— NINTH EDITION . Whitman supervised the make-up of this issue during his last illness .<date>1897</date>— TENTH EDITION . Here appeared for the first time , Old Age Echoes , numbering thirteen poems .<date>1902</date>— ELEVENTH AND DEFINITIVE EDITION . Issued by the literary executors of Walt Whitman — Horace L. Traubel , Richard Maurice Bucke , and Thomas B. Harned . There have been six editions of Whitman 's complete writings , and numerous selections from Leaves of Grass have been published under the editorship of well-known literary men — among them , William M. Rossetti , Ernest Rhys , W. T. Stead , and Oscar L. Triggs . There have been translations into German , French , Italian , Russian , and several Asiatic languages . “ I had my choice when I commenc 'd , ” he notes in his Backward Glance of<date>1880</date>; “ I bid neither for soft eulogies , big money returns , nor the approbation of existing schools and conventions .... Unstopp 'd and unwarp 'd by any influence outside the soul within me , I have had my say entirely my own way , and put it unerringly on record — the value thereof to be decided by time . ”</docImprint>

    <head>III</head>
    <head>With the war-time period came the turning point in the popular estimate of Walt Whitman . No doubt , too , his experiences during this time of stress and storm influenced the rest of his career as a man and as a writer . His service as a volunteer nurse in camp and in hospital gave him a sympathetic insight and a patriotic outlook tempered with gentleness which are reflected in his poetry of this period , published under the title Drum-Taps . His well-known song of sorrow , O Captain , My Captain , is a threnody poignant with genuine feeling . It has , more than any others of his verses , lyric rather than plangent quality . When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloomed , and The Sobbing of the Bells are other poems belonging to this distinctive group . It is notable that in his lament over the death of Lincoln , Whitman gives rhyme as well as rhythm to the verses .</head>
     <l n="1">This was a time of triumph for Whitman in a literary sense . In</l>
     <l n="2">Germany , the poet Ferdinand Freiligrath contributed to the Allgemeine</l>
     <l n="3">Zeitung , Augsburg , May 10 , 1868 , a long article in praise of his work .</l>
     <l n="4">In England , his poetry attracted the attention of the Rossettis ,</l>
     <l n="5">Tennyson , John Addington Symonds . Mrs. Anne Gilchrist defended him</l>
     <l n="6">from the aspersions cast upon his references to womanhood . A</l>
     <l n="7">sympathetic and friendly tone began to displace the collection of</l>
     <l n="8">distasteful adjectives which had been his meed heretofore .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Then , in the latter part of 1865 , occurred an episode which drew around Whitman a circle of friends keen to resent , and active to condemn , an act of injustice from one high in authority . Among the influential friends who rushed to his defense were John Burroughs and William Douglas O'Connor , and the events which drew their fire were these :</p>
   <p>Whitman , whose health was shattered by his untiring devotion and ministrations to ill and wounded soldiers , had been given a minor clerkship in the Department of the Interior . James Harlan was Secretary of the Department . He had been a Methodist clergyman and president of a western college . When his attention was called to Whitman 's authorship of Leaves of Grass , the Secretary characterized the book as “ full of indecent passages , ” the author was termed “ a very bad man , ” and was abruptly dismissed from the position he had held for six months .</p>
   <p>Whitman meekly accepted the curt dismissal , but William Douglas O'Connor in a white heat of indignation issued a pamphlet which flayed the astonished Secretary of the Interior as a narrow-minded calumniator . The pamphlet , now a very rare document , was headed :</p>
   <p>THE GOOD GRAY POET A VINDICATION</p>
   <p>With Celtic fervor and eloquence , William Douglas O'Connor made his plea an intercession in the cause of free letters . He examined the entire range of literature , ancient and modern , in quest of parallels that would prove Whitman 's book by comparison to be a masterpiece of literature , and would demonstrate Mr. Secretary Harlan to be merely a literary headsman . Out of many pages of allusion to the literary productions of the great writers of all time and for all time , some characteristic passages may be chosen :</p>
   <p>“ Here is Dante . Open the tremendous pages of the Inferno . What is this line at the end of the twenty-first canto , which even John Carlyle flinches from translating , but which Dante did not flinch from writing ? Out with Dante !</p>
   <p>“ Here is the book of Job : the vast Arabian landscape , the picturesque pastoral details of Arabian life , the last tragic immensity of Oriental sorrow , the whole over-arching sky of Oriental piety , are here . But here also the inevitable ‘ indecency . ’ Out with Job !</p>
   <p>“ Here is Plutarch , prince of biographers , and Herodotus , flower of historians . What have we now ? Traits of character not to be mentioned , incidents of conduct , accounts of manners , minute details of customs , which our modern historical dandies would never venture upon recording . Out with Plutarch and Herodotus !</p>
   <p>“ Here is Shakespeare : ‘ indecent passages ’ everywhere ; every drama , every poem thickly inlaid with them ; all that men do displayed , sexual acts treated lightly , jested about , mentioned obscenely ; the language never bolted ; slang , gross puns , lewd words , in profusion . Out with Shakespeare !</p>
   <p>“ Here is the Canticle of Canticles : beautiful , voluptuous poem of love literally , whatever be its mystic significance ; glowing with the color , odorous with the spices , melodious with the voices of the East ; sacred and exquisite and pure with the burning chastity of passion , which completes and exceeds the snowy chastity of virgins . This to me , but what to the Secretary ? Can he endure that the female form should stand thus in a poem , disrobed , unveiled , bathed in erotic splendor ? Look at these voluptuous details , this expression of desire , this amorous tone and glow , this consecration and perfume lavished upon the sensual . No ! Out with Solomon !</p>
   <p>“ Here is Isaiah . The grand thunder-roll of that righteousness , like the lion-roar of Jehovah above the guilty world , utters coarse words . Amidst the bolted lightnings of that sublime denunciation , coarse thoughts , indelicate figures , indecent allusions , flash upon the sight , like gross imagery in a midnight landscape . Out with Isaiah !</p>
   <p>“ Here is Montaigne . Open those great , those virtuous pages of the unflinching reporter of man ; the soul all truth and daylight , all candor , probity , sincerity , reality , eyesight . A few glances will suffice . Cant and vice and sniffle have groaned over these pages before . Out with Montaigne !</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Here is Swedenborg . Open this poem of prose , the Conjugal</l>
     <l n="2">Love , to me , a temple , though in ruins ; the sacred fane ,</l>
     <l n="3">clothed in mist , filled with moonlight , of a great though</l>
     <l n="4">broken mind . What spittle of critic epithets stains all here ?</l>
     <l n="5">‘ Lewd , ’ ‘ sensual , ’ ‘ lecherous , ’ ‘ coarse , ’ ‘ licentious , ’ etc .</l>
     <l n="6">Of course these judgments are final . There is no appeal from</l>
     <l n="7">the tobacco-juice of an expectorating and disdainful virtue .</l>
     <l n="8">Out with Swedenborg !</l>
   </lg>
   <p>“ Here is Goethe : the horrified squealing of prudes is not yet silent over pages of Wilhelm Meister : that high and chaste book , the Elective Affinities , still pumps up oaths from clergymen . Walpurgis has hardly ceased its uproar over Faust . Out with Goethe !</p>
   <p>“ Here is Cervantes : open Don Quixote , paragon of romances , highest result of Spain , best and sufficient reason for her life among the nations , a laughing novel which is a weeping poem . But talk such as this of Sancho Panza and Tummas Cecial under the cork trees , and these coarse stories and bawdy words , and this free and gross comedy — is it to be endured ? Out with Cervantes !</p>
   <p>“ And here is Lord Bacon himself , in one of whose pages you may read , done from the Latin by Spedding into a magnificent golden thunder of English , the absolute defense of the free spirit of the great authors , coupled with stern rebuke to the spirit that would pick and choose , as dastard and effeminate . Out with Lord Bacon !</p>
   <p>“ Not him only , not these only , not only the writers are under the ban . Here is Phidias , gorgeous sculptor in gold and ivory , giant dreamer of the Infinite in marble ; but he will not use the fig-leaf . Here is Rembrandt , who paints the Holland landscape , the Jew , the beggar , the burgher , in lights and glooms of Eternity ; and his pictures have been called ‘ indecent , ’ Here is Mozart , his music rich with the sumptuous color of all sunsets ; and it has been called ‘ sensual . ’ Here is Michael Angelo , who makes art tremble with a new and strange afflatus , and gives Europe novel and sublime forms that tower above the centuries , and accost the Greek ; and his works have been called ‘ bestial . ’ Out with them all ! ”</p>
   <p>In his summing up , stirred to wrath by the low tone of contemporary comment , O'Connor proceeded to expound the philosophy of literary ideals :</p>
   <p>“ The level of the great books is the Infinite , the Absolute . To contain all , by containing the premise , the truth , the idea and feeling of all , to tally the universe by profusion , variety , reality , mystery , enclosure , power , terror , beauty , service ; to be great to the utmost conceivability of greatness — what higher level than this can literature spring to ? Up on the highest summit stand such works , never to be surpassed , never to be supplanted . Their indecency is not that of the vulgar ; their vulgarity is not that of the low . Their evil , if it be evil , is not there for nothing — it serves ; at the base of it is Love . Every poet of the highest quality is , in the masterly coinage of the author of Leaves of Grass , a kosmos . His work , like himself , is a second world , full of contrarieties , strangely harmonized , and moral indeed , but only as the world is moral . Shakespeare is all good , Rabelais is all good , Montaigne is all good , not because all the thoughts , the words , the manifestations are so , but because at the core , and permeating all , is an ethic intention — a love which , through mysterious , indirect , subtle , seemingly absurd , often terrible and repulsive , means , seeks to uplift , and never to degrade . It is the spirit in which authorship is pursued , as Augustus Schlegel has said , that makes it either an infamy or a virtue ; and the spirit of the great authors , no matter what their letter , is one with that which pervades the Creation . In mighty love , with implements of pain and pleasure , of good and evil , Nature develops man ; genius also , in mighty love , with implements of pain and pleasure , of good and evil , develops man ; no matter what the means , that is the end .</p>
   <p>“ Tell me not , then , of the indecent passages of the great poets . The world , which is the poem of God , is full of indecent passages ! ‘ Shall there be evil in a city and the Lord hath not done it ? ’ shouts Amos . ‘ I form the light , and create darkness ; I make peace , and create evil ; I , the Lord , do all these things , ’ thunders Isaiah . ‘ This , ’ says Coleridge , ‘ is the deep abyss of the mystery of God . ’ Ay , and the profound of the mystery of genius also ! Evil is part of the economy of genius , as it is part of the economy of Deity . Gentle reviewers endeavor to find excuses for the freedoms of geniuses . ‘ It is to prove that they were above conventionalities . ’ ‘ It is referable to the age . ’ Oh , Ossa on Pelion , mount piled on mount , of error and folly ! What has genius , spirit of the absolute and the eternal , to do with the definitions of position , or conventionalities , or the age ? Genius puts indecencies into its works , because God puts them into His world . Whatever the special reason in each case , this is the general reason in all cases . They are here , because they are there . That is the eternal why . No ; Alphonso of Castile thought that , if he had been consulted at the Creation , he could have given a few hints to the Almighty . Not I. I play Alphonso neither to genius nor to God .</p>
   <p>“ What is this poem , for the giving of which to America and the world , and for that alone , its author has been dismissed with ignominy from a Government office ? It is a poem which Schiller might have hailed as the noblest specimen of native literature , worthy of a place beside Homer . It is , in the first place , a work purely and entirely American , autochthonic , sprung from our own soil ; no savor of Europe nor the past , nor of any other literature in it ; a vast carol of our own land , and of its Present and Future ; the strong and haughty psalm of the Republic . There is not one other book , I care not whose , of which this can be said . I weigh my words and have considered well . Every other book by an American author implies , both in form and substance , I cannot even say the European , but the British mind . The shadow of Temple Bar and Arthur 's Seat lies dark on all our letters . Intellectually we are still a dependency of Great Britain , and one word — colonial — comprehends and stamps our literature . In no literary form , except our newspapers , has there been anything distinctively American . I note our best books — the works of Jefferson , the romances of Brockden Brown , the speeches of Webster , Everett 's rhetoric , the divinity of Channing , some of Cooper 's novels , the writings of Theodore Parker , the poetry of Bryant , the masterly law arguments of Lysander Spooner , the miscellanies of Margaret Fuller , the histories of Hildreth , Bancroft and Motley , Ticknor 's History of Spanish Literature , Judd 's Margaret , the political treatises of Calhoun , the rich , benignant poems of Longfellow , the ballads of Whittier , the delicate songs of Philip Pendleton Cooke , the weird poetry of Edgar Poe , the wizard tales of Hawthorne , Irving 's Knickerbocker , Delia Bacon 's splendid sibyllic book on Shakespeare , the political economy of Carey , the prison letters and immortal speech of John Brown , the lofty patrician eloquence of Wendell Phillips , and those diamonds of the first water , the great clear essays and greater poems of Emerson . This literature has often commanding merits , and much of it is very precious to me ; but in respect to its national character , all that can be said is that it is tinged , more or less deeply , with America ; and the foreign model , the foreign standards , the foreign ideas , dominate over it all .</p>
   <p>“ At most , our best books were but struggling beams ; behold in Leaves of Grass the immense and absolute sunrise ! It is all our own ! The nation is in it ! In form a series of chants , in substance it is an epic of America . It is distinctively and utterly American . Without model , without imitation , without reminiscence , it is evolved entirely from our own polity and popular life . Look at what it celebrates and contains ! hardly to be enumerated without sometimes using the powerful , wondrous phrases of its author , so indissoluble are they with the things described . The essences , the events , the objects of America ; the myriad , varied landscapes ; the teeming and giant cities ; the generous and turbulent populations ; the prairie solitudes , the vast pastoral plateaus ; the Mississippi ; the land dense with villages and farms ; the habits , manners , customs ; the enormous diversity of temperatures ; the immense geography ; the red aborigines passing away , ‘ charging the water and the land with names ’ ; the early settlements ; the sudden uprising and defiance of the Revolution ; the august figure of Washington ; the formation and sacredness of the Constitution ; the pouring in of the emigrants ; the million-masted harbors ; the general opulence and comfort ; the fisheries , and whaling , and gold-digging , and manufactures , and agriculture ; the dazzling movement of new States , rushing to be great ; Nevada rising , Dakota rising , Colorado rising ; the tumultuous civilization around and beyond the Rocky Mountains , thundering and spreading ; the Union impregnable ; feudalism in all its forms forever tracked and assaulted ; liberty deathless on these shores ; the noble and free character of the people ; the equality of male and female ; the ardor , the fierceness , the friendship , the dignity , the enterprise , the affection , the courage , the love of music , the passion for personal freedom ; the mercy and justice and compassion of the people ; the popular faults and vices and crimes ; the deference of the President to the private citizen ; the image of Christ forever deepening in the public mind as the brother of despised and rejected persons ; the promise and wild song of the future ; the vision of the Federal Mother , seated with more than antique majesty in the midst of her many children ; the pouring glories of the hereafter ; the vistas of splendor , incessant and branching , the tremendous elements , breeds , adjustments of America — with all these , with more , with everything transcendent , amazing and new , undimmed by the pale cast of thought , and with the very color and brawn of actual life , the whole gigantic epic of our continental being unwinds in all its magnificent reality in these pages . To understand Greece , study the Iliad and the Odyssey ; study Leaves of Grass to understand America . Her democracy is there . Would you have a text-book of democracy ? The writings of Jefferson are good ; De Tocqueville is better ; but the great poet always contains historian and philosopher — and to know the comprehending spirit of this country , you shall question these insulted pages . ”</p>

    <head>IV</head>
    <head>It would be wearisome to refer in detail to the numerous estimates of Leaves of Grass which have found print since 1870 . The increasing literature about Whitman bespeaks interest , and the kindly tenor of most commentators testifies to the enlarging appreciation of the Good Gray Poet . Within the past decade there have appeared seven biographies of him , all but one of them wholly and frankly lavish in his praise , and that one not unfriendly in criticism . Numerous book chapters have dealt with him in recognition of his genius , and only here and there have there been suggestions of earlier absolute condemnation . Among the biographers have been , in chronological sequence , Richard Maurice Bucke , John Burroughs , John Addington Symonds , Isaac Hull Platt , Geo . R. Carpenter , Bliss Perry , Henry Bryan Binns . Among the notable contributors of book chapters on Whitman may be mentioned from a list of two score or more , Robert Louis Stevenson , in his Studies of Men and Books ; A. T. Quiller-Couch , in his Adventures in Criticism ; Thomas Wentworth Higginson , in his Contemporaries ; Havelock Ellis , in The New Spirit ; Edward Dowden , in his Studies in Literature ; Edmund Gosse , in his Critical Kit-Kats ; Hamilton Mabie , in his Backgrounds of Literature ; Brander Matthews , in his Aspects of Fiction ; Edmund Clarence Stedman , in his Poets of America ; George Santayana , in The Poetry of Barbarism ; and Algernon Charles Swinburne , in his Studies in Prose and Poetry . These have been mentioned specifically because they average the good and the bad rather than join in a chorus of indiscriminate praise . Indeed , the two last mentioned are distinctly hostile in tone . Swinburne , who in his earlier volume Songs before Sunrise , addressed a long poem , To Walt Whitman in America , fervent in praise ,</head>
     <l n="1">“ Send but a song oversea for us ,</l>
     <l n="2">Heart of their hearts who are free ,</l>
     <l n="3">Heart of their singer to be for us</l>
     <l n="4">More than our singing can be , ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>revoked all his former words of sympathetic admiration and in his later volume , printed in 1894 , vehemently fell upon Whitman in this strain :</p>
   <p>“ There is no subject which may not be treated with success ( I do not say there are no subjects which on other than artistic grounds it may not be as well to avoid , it may not be better to pass by ) if the poet , by instinct or by training , knows exactly how to handle it aright , to present it without danger of just or rational offense . For evidence of this truth we need look no further than the pastorals of Virgil and Theocritus . But under the dirty clumsy paws of a harper whose plectrum is a muck-rake any tune will become a chaos of discords , though the motive of the tune should be the first principle of nature — the passion of man for woman or the passion of woman for man . And the unhealthily demonstrative and obtrusive animalism of the Whitmaniad is as unnatural , as incompatible with the wholesome instincts of human passion , as even the filthy and inhuman asceticism of SS . Macarius and Simeon Stylites . If anything can justify the serious and deliberate display of merely physical emotion in literature or in art , it must be one of two things ; intense depth of feeling expressed with inspired perfection of simplicity , with divine sublimity of fascination , as by Sappho ; or transcendent supremacy of actual and irresistible beauty in such revelation of naked nature as was possible to Titian . But Mr. Whitman 's Eve is a drunken apple-woman , indecently sprawling in the slush and garbage of the gutter amid the rotten refuse of her overturned fruit-stall : but Mr. Whitman 's Venus is a Hottentot wench under the influence of cantharides and adulterated rum . ”</p>
   <p>Weighing the good and the bad , Robert Louis Stevenson in his essay does not stint admiration nor withhold blame :</p>
   <p>“ He has chosen a rough , unrhymed , lyrical verse ; sometimes instinct with a fine processional movement ; often so rugged and careless that it can only be described by saying that he has not taken the trouble to write prose * * * and one thing is certain , that no one can appreciate Whitman 's excellences until he has grown accustomed to his faults . ”</p>
   <p>Indicating the attitude of his partisans , John Burroughs ’ summing up is fairly representative :</p>
   <p>“ Just as ripe , mellowed , storied , ivy-towered , velvet-turfed England lies back of Tennyson , and is vocal through him ; just as canny , covenanting , conscience-burdened , craggy , sharp-tongued Scotland lies back of Carlyle ; just as thrifty , well-schooled , well-housed , prudent and moral New England lies back of her group of poets , and is voiced by them — so America as a whole , our turbulent democracy , our self-glorification , our faith in the future , our huge mass-movements , our continental spirit , our sprawling , sublime and unkempt nature lie back of Whitman , and are implied by his work . ”</p>
   <p>It is not the purpose of this book to interpret Whitman either as a prophet or a poet , except inferentially as the words of his critics may carry distinct impressions . After all , the justest estimate of Whitman and his book is his own . Whitman 's puzzling characteristics are best understood if we realize that Leaves of Grass is an autobiography — and an extraordinarily candid one — of a man whose peculiar temperament found expression in prose-verse . His gentleness , his brusqueness , his egotism , his humility , his grossness , his finer nature , his crudeness , his eloquence , are all here . To him they were the attributes of all mankind .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ I am of old and young , of the foolish as much as the wise ;</l>
     <l n="2">Regardless of others , ever regardful of others ,</l>
     <l n="3">Maternal as well as paternal , a child as well as a man ,</l>
     <l n="4">Stuff 'd with the stuff that is coarse , and stuff 'd with the</l>
     <l n="5">stuff that is fine . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="6">In his virile young manhood he announced with gusto : “ I sound my</l>
     <l n="7">barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="8">In his serene old age he said : “ Over the tree-tops I float thee a</l>
     <l n="9">song . ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>And this was his conclusion : “ I call to the world to distrust the accounts of my friends , but listen to my enemies as I myself do . I charge you forever reject those who would expound me , for I cannot expound myself . ”</p>
   <p>Whoso challenges Whitman 's gift of song may not at any rate deny to him the note of melody . This quality is strong in his titles particularly :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Rise O days from your fathomless deeps .</l>
     <l n="2">In cabin 'd ships at sea .</l>
     <l n="3">Out of the cradle endlessly rocking .</l>
     <l n="4">Sands at seventy .</l>
     <l n="5">The sobbing of the bells .</l>
     <l n="6">Soon shall the winter 's foil be here .</l>
     <l n="7">Thou mother with thy equal brood .</l>
     <l n="8">To the leaven 'd soil they trod .</l>
     <l n="9">Yon tides with ceaseless swell .</l>
     <l n="10">When lilacs last in the dooryard bloomed .</l>
     <l n="11">Sparkles from the wheel .</l>
     <l n="12">Brother of all with generous hand .</l>
     <l n="13">As a strong bird on pinions free .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>For a just estimate of Whitman , as for a clear comprehension of the symbolism contained in Leaves of Grass , a few blades of the latter will not suffice . It must be all , or none . The two poems here given should be taken , therefore , not as representative of the whole , but as types of two widely variant moods :</p>
