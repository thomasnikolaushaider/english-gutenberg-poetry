    <docImprint>WE cannot sing of life , whose years are brief , Nor sad heart-stories tell , who know no grief , Nor write of shipwrecks on the seas of Fate , Whose ship from out the harbor sailed but late . But we may sing of fair and sunny days , Of Love that walks in peace through quiet ways ; And unto him who turns the page to see Our simple story , haply it may be As when in some mild day in early spring , One through the budding woods goes wandering ; And finds , where late the snow has blown across , Beneath the leaves , a violet in the moss .<date>1887</date>. A. F. B . NOW I can sing of life , whose days are brief , For I have walked close hand in hand with grief . And I may tell of shipwrecked hopes , since mine Sank just outside the happy harbor line . But still my song is of those sunny days When Love was with me in those quiet ways . And unto him who turns the page to see That day 's short story , haply it may be , The joy of those old memories he feels : As one who through the wintry twilight steals , And sees , across the chilly wastes of snow , The darkened sunset 's rosy afterglow .<date>1892</date>.

   <p>The Lighting of the Candles .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">WHENCE came the ember</l>
     <l n="2">That touched our young souls ’ candles first with light ;</l>
     <l n="3">In shadowy years , too distant to remember ,</l>
     <l n="4">Where childhood merges backward into night ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">I know not , but the halo of those tapers</l>
     <l n="6">Has ever since around all nature shone ;</l>
     <l n="7">And we have looked at life through golden vapors</l>
     <l n="8">Because of that one ember touch alone .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">At Early Candle-Lighting .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="10">THOSE , who have heard the whispered breath</l>
     <l n="11">Of Nature 's secret “ Shibboleth , ”</l>
     <l n="12">And learned the pass-word to unroll</l>
     <l n="13">The veil that hides her inmost soul ,</l>
     <l n="14">May follow ; but this by-path leads</l>
     <l n="15">Through mullein stalks and jimson-weeds .</l>
     <l n="16">And he who scorning treads them down</l>
     <l n="17">Would deem but poor and common-place</l>
     <l n="18">Those whom he 'll meet in homespun gown .</l>
     <l n="19">But they who lovingly retrace</l>
     <l n="20">Their steps to scenes I dream about ,</l>
     <l n="21">Will find the latch-string hanging out .</l>
     <l n="22">With them I claim companionship ,</l>
     <l n="23">And for them burn my tallow-dip ,</l>
     <l n="24">At early candle-lighting .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="25">To these low hills , around which cling</l>
     <l n="26">My fondest thoughts , I would not bring</l>
     <l n="27">An alien eye long used to sights</l>
     <l n="28">Among the snow-crowned Alpine heights .</l>
     <l n="29">An eagle does not bend its wing</l>
     <l n="30">To low-built nests where robins sing .</l>
     <l n="31">Between the fence 's zigzag rails ,</l>
     <l n="32">The stranger sees the road that trails</l>
     <l n="33">Its winding way into the dark ,</l>
     <l n="34">Fern-scented woods . He does not mark</l>
     <l n="35">The old log cabin at the end</l>
     <l n="36">As I , or hail it as a friend ,</l>
     <l n="37">Or catch , when daylight 's last rays wane ,</l>
     <l n="38">The glimmer through its narrow pane</l>
     <l n="39">Of early candle-lighting .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="40">As anglers sit and half in dream</l>
     <l n="41">Dip lazy lines into the stream ,</l>
     <l n="42">And watch the swimming life below ,</l>
     <l n="43">So I watch pictures come and go .</l>
     <l n="44">And in the flame , Alladin-wise ,</l>
     <l n="45">See genii of the past arise .</l>
     <l n="46">If it be so that common things</l>
     <l n="47">Can fledge your fancy with fast wings ;</l>
     <l n="48">If you the language can translate</l>
     <l n="49">Of lowly life , and make it great ,</l>
     <l n="50">And can the beauty understand</l>
     <l n="51">That dignifies a toil-worn hand ,</l>
     <l n="52">Look in this halo , and see how</l>
     <l n="53">The homely seems transfigured now</l>
     <l n="54">At early candle-lighting .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="55">A fire-place where the great logs roar</l>
     <l n="56">And shine across the puncheon floor ,</l>
     <l n="57">And through the chinked walls , here and there ,</l>
     <l n="58">The snow steals , and the frosty air .</l>
     <l n="59">Meager and bare the furnishings ,</l>
     <l n="60">But hospitality that kings</l>
     <l n="61">Might well dispense , transmutes to gold ,</l>
     <l n="62">The welcome given young and old .</l>
     <l n="63">Plain and uncouth in speech and dress ,</l>
     <l n="64">But richly clad in kindliness ,</l>
     <l n="65">The neighbors gather , one by one ,</l>
     <l n="66">At rustic rout when day is done .</l>
     <l n="67">Vanish all else in this soft light ,—</l>
     <l n="68">The past is ours again tonight ;</l>
     <l n="69">‘ Tis early candle-lighting .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="70">Oh , well-remembered scenes like these :</l>
     <l n="71">The candy-pullings , husking-bees —</l>
     <l n="72">The evenings when the quilting frames</l>
     <l n="73">Were laid aside for romping games ;</l>
     <l n="74">The singing school ! The spelling match !</l>
     <l n="75">My hand still lingers on the latch ,</l>
     <l n="76">I fain would wider swing the door</l>
     <l n="77">And enter with the guests once more .</l>
     <l n="78">Though into ashes long ago</l>
     <l n="79">That fire faded , still the glow</l>
     <l n="80">That warmed the hearts around it met ,</l>
     <l n="81">Immortal , burns within me yet .</l>
     <l n="82">Still to that cabin in the wood</l>
     <l n="83">I turn for highest types of good</l>
     <l n="84">At early candle-lighting .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="85">How fast the scenes come flocking to</l>
     <l n="86">My mind , as white sheep jostle through</l>
     <l n="87">The gap , when pasture bars are down ,</l>
     <l n="88">And pass into the twilight brown .</l>
     <l n="89">Grandmother 's face and snowy cap ,</l>
     <l n="90">The knitting work upon her lap ,</l>
     <l n="91">The creaking , high-backed rocking-chair ;</l>
     <l n="92">The spinning-wheel , the big loom where</l>
     <l n="93">The shuttle carried song and thread ;</l>
     <l n="94">The valance on the high , white bed</l>
     <l n="95">Whose folds the lavender still keep .</l>
     <l n="96">Oh ! nowhere else such dreamless sleep</l>
     <l n="97">On tired eyes its deep spell lays ,</l>
     <l n="98">As that which came in those old days</l>
     <l n="99">At early candle-lighting .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="100">A kitchen lit by one dim light ,</l>
     <l n="101">And ‘ round the table in affright ,</l>
     <l n="102">A group of children telling tales .</l>
     <l n="103">Outside , the wind — a banshee — wails .</l>
     <l n="104">Even the shadows , that they throw</l>
     <l n="105">Upon the walls , to giants grow .</l>
     <l n="106">The hailstones ‘ gainst the window panes</l>
     <l n="107">Fall with the noise of clanking chains ,</l>
     <l n="108">Till , glancing back , they almost feel</l>
     <l n="109">Black shapes from out the corners steal ,</l>
     <l n="110">And , climbing to the loft o'erhead ,</l>
     <l n="111">The witches follow them to bed .</l>
     <l n="112">The low flame flickers . Snuff the wick !</l>
     <l n="113">For ghosts and goblins crowd so thick</l>
     <l n="114">At early candle-lighting .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="115">An orchard path that tramping feet</l>
     <l n="116">For half a century have beat ;</l>
     <l n="117">Here to the fields at sun-up went</l>
     <l n="118">The reapers . Here , on errands sent ,</l>
     <l n="119">Small bare-feet loitered , loath to go .</l>
     <l n="120">Here apple-boughs dropped blooming snow ,</l>
     <l n="121">Through garden borders gaily set</l>
     <l n="122">With touch-me-nots and bouncing Bet ;</l>
     <l n="123">Here passed at dusk the harvester</l>
     <l n="124">With quickened step and pulse astir</l>
     <l n="125">At sight of some one 's fluttering gown ,</l>
     <l n="126">Who stood with sunbonnet pulled down</l>
     <l n="127">And called the cows . Ah , in a glance</l>
     <l n="128">One reads that simple , old romance</l>
     <l n="129">At early candle-lighting .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="130">One picture more . A winter day</l>
     <l n="131">Just done , and supper cleared away .</l>
     <l n="132">The romping children quiet grow ,</l>
     <l n="133">And in the reverent silence , slow</l>
     <l n="134">The old man turns the sacred page ,</l>
     <l n="135">Guide of his life and staff of age .</l>
     <l n="136">And then , the while my eyes grow dim ,</l>
     <l n="137">The mother 's voice begins a hymn :</l>
     <l n="138">“ Sweet hour of prayer , sweet hour of prayer</l>
     <l n="139">That calls me from a world of care ! ”</l>
     <l n="140">What wonder from those cabins rude</l>
     <l n="141">Came lives of stalwart rectitude ,</l>
     <l n="142">When hearth-stones were the altars where</l>
     <l n="143">Arose the vestal flame of prayer</l>

     <l n="162">Of crowded streets that city walls shut in ,</l>
     <l n="163">I heard the whistle of a quail begin :</l>
     <l n="164">“ Bob White ! Bob White ! ”</l>
     <l n="165">So faintly and far away falling</l>
     <l n="166">It seemed that a dream voice was calling</l>

     <l n="184">In the meadow lands ripe for mowing ,</l>
     <l n="185">All red and white .</l>
