    <head>I</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Slowly maturity has come to our surprise ,</l>
     <l n="2">Placing its hands upon the naked forehead of our love ,</l>
     <l n="3">Looking upon it with its dimmer eyes .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="4">And , in the garden shrivelled by July ,</l>
     <l n="5">The flowers and shrubs and vibrant leaves</l>
     <l n="6">Have let fall their fervent powers which lie</l>
     <l n="7">Over the misty pond and gentle paths .</l>
     <l n="8">And bitterly the jealous sun now shows</l>
     <l n="9">Harshly a brilliant shadow</l>
     <l n="10">Round its light that grieves .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="11">And yet , see how the fearless hollyhocks aspire</l>
     <l n="12">Ardently to their own splendid fire !</l>
     <l n="13">See how season after season 's stress</l>
     <l n="14">Is vain — the fibres of our hearts</l>
     <l n="15">Deeper than ever and insatiable ,</l>
     <l n="16">Are rooted firmly in our happiness .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="17">Oh hours of afternoon , fragrant with rose ,</l>
     <l n="18">Clutching at time , with cheek in flower and flame ,</l>
     <l n="19">Seeking , against his chilly side , repose !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="20">And nothing , nothing is better than to feel</l>
     <l n="21">Happy and limpid still — after what years ?</l>
     <l n="22">But if fate had willed above</l>
     <l n="23">For us two naught but suffering and tears ,</l>
     <l n="24">Still , would I have wished to live and die</l>
     <l n="25">Complaintless , in such unrelenting love !</l>

      <l n="26">Roses of June , you the most fair ,</l>
      <l n="27">You with your hearts transpierced by sun ;</l>
      <l n="28">Violent , tranquil roses , with the air</l>
      <l n="29">Of halted flights of birds upon a bough ;</l>
      <l n="30">Roses of June and July , straight and new-begun ,</l>
      <l n="31">Mouths whose kisses all at once are thrilled</l>
      <l n="32">With the wind or with it stilled ,</l>
      <l n="33">Caressing with shade and gold the moving green ;</l>
      <l n="34">Roses mutely ardent and sweet willed ,</l>
      <l n="35">Voluptuous roses in your sheaths of moss ,</l>
      <l n="36">You who pass the long summer time</l>
      <l n="37">Loving each other</l>
      <l n="38">In this clarity sublime ;</l>
      <l n="39">Fresh , magnificent , vivid — like you , oh roses ,</l>
      <l n="40">Is our multitudinous desire</l>
      <l n="41">That in lassitude or leaping fire</l>
      <l n="42">Loves , exalts , and then reposes !</l>

      <l n="64">Oh ! how your eyes are beauteous at this hour</l>

      <l n="68">Intensity of life , its goodness and its power ,</l>
