    <docTitle><titlePart>Once in a generation an author surpasses the bounds of nationality . Of such cosmopolitan artists Maurice Maeterlinck is perhaps the most shining example . Twenty years ago I was vainly endeavouring to interest English publishers in his plays . To-day I am asked to produce a version of one of his earlier and less familiar works , because the time is approaching for that monument to his fame which so few writers enjoy in their lifetime — namely , the complete edition . He is not a Belgian writer merely or chiefly ; above all he is an English , an American author . His readers in England and the United States far outnumber those who read the original French . His books are published in England and America almost as soon as they appear in France and Belgium , and in at least one case the English publication was the earlier . More and more do his lovers demand every word that his pen has formed . Sooner or later , therefore , it was inevitable that these “ Poems ” should appear in translation .</titlePart></docTitle>

   <head>II</head>
   <p>The poems contained in this volume form part of a movement long defunct — the Belgian Symbolist movement , an offshoot of that Belgian renascence which produced so remarkable a body of great and noble poetry . I cannot say , however , that perusal of the other poets of the period will assist the reader to appreciate the volume in hand . Eekhoud , Elskamp , Gilkin , Rodenbach , Verhaeren — none of these wrote verse which could possibly be confounded with that of Maeterlinck ; twenty years ago the latter was no less original than he is to-day .</p>
   <p>Many poets of the late nineteenth century were , without being symbolists , affected by the Symbolist movement — a movement very loosely named , since the actual symbolists connected with it could be counted on the fingers of one hand . More particularly were they influenced by the tendency to put music before matter , beauty before sense , which is expressed by the so familiar lines of Verlaine :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">De la musique avant toute chose ,</l>
     <l n="2">Et pour cela préfère l'Impair ,</l>
     <l n="3">Plus vague et plus soluble dans l'air ,</l>
     <l n="4">Sans rien en lui qui pèse ou pose ...</l>
     <l n="5">De la musique encor et toujours !</l>
   </lg>
   <p>But musical as Maeterlinck 's verses are , and rich in sheer beauty , we are very seldom in doubt as to what the poet says , however little we may in some cases understand what he means . His statements are concrete and lucid ; it is the inner meaning , the soul of his verse , that sometimes threatens to elude us . Had this volume been cast upon the late Victorian world this preface would perhaps have been longer . But I cannot believe that these poems will present any difficulties to a generation which has degustated such phenomena as Cubism and its kindred manifestations .</p>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>III</head>
     <l n="1">It is safe to assert that the writer of these poems had read his</l>
     <l n="2">Verlaine , his Rimbaud , his Mallarmé , and his Baudelaire , and of</l>
     <l n="3">English-speaking poets Emerson , Poe , perhaps Rossetti , and above all</l>
     <l n="4">Whitman . But he is no disciple ; and his essential originality , and the</l>
     <l n="5">keynote of his aesthetics , is a system of symbolism .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Now here at once we are on dangerous ground . When a poet makes use of a symbol it is because that symbol enables him to say something that he cannot say so well , or so beautifully , or perhaps at all , in plain language . He is a rash man , therefore , who will attempt to elucidate another 's symbolism . However , I have already been rash , in venturing to translate , not a few selected lyrics , but an entire volume of verse from cover to cover , than which there is no more appalling task in literature . But I am not , therefore , disposed to court disaster by attempting any detailed or positive explanation . I could indeed have asked M. Maeterlinck for such ; but at the moment of writing his country is being crucified by the powers of darkness , and he has other and sterner matters to think of .</p>
   <p>This machinery of hot-houses , bell-glasses , hospitals , and what not — what are we to make of it ? I do not think we shall go far wrong in supposing the hot-house , the bell-glass , the diving-bell , the hospital , to typify the isolation and insulation caused by a false civilization and an unreal religion , so productive of hypocrisy , fear , and confusion that each man is a prisoner within himself , unable to reach his fellow . And the inmates of the hot-house — the strange growths , the fantastic visions , the violent antitheses and incongruities — these , we may take it , are the morbidities fostered by a life which protects us and them from the agencies by which Nature makes her own children perfect in strength and beauty and service . That is my reading of it ; the reader is perfectly free to differ from me , and will lose little by so doing if I have succeeded in preserving a tithe of the original beauty of the verse .</p>
   <p>If here and there — more particularly in the unrhymed pieces — the violent and intentional incongruities and antitheses seem startling and incomprehensible , and a little apt to tickle the risibility of the frivolous Anglo-Saxon , let us remember that to read a symbolic poem literally is as foolish as to seek for a cipher in Shakespeare , or to set about interpreting a melody in terms of its notation , in the hope of spelling out a message .</p>
   <p>One peculiarity of Maeterlinck 's which may at first confuse the English reader is only a simple convention . All poetry is full of similes ; the simile confuses no one . If a poet tells us that his heart is like a singing-bird we do not seriously suppose him to mean that his heart has feathers and two legs ; but merely that it possesses some other essential quality of a singing-bird . Now Maeterlinck constantly , in his verse , uses what is merely a modification of the simile , which has precisely the same significance , but which takes the form of a positive assertion of identity . He would say : My heart is a singing-bird or a plant in a green-house , or anything else that seemed to be illuminating ; and this apparent literalness of statement , which is carried very far , is , and must always be understood as , a mere variant of the familiar simile .</p>
   <p>IV</p>
   <p>A word as to the work of translation . Most of the lyrics in Serres Chaudes are written in the metre familiar to English readers as that of “ In Memoriam . ” It is , in English , rather a dull metre , the stanza being in reality no stanza at all , but merely a line of thirty-two syllables with interior rhymes . It is greatly improved and enlivened by the omission of four syllables , or rather by their replacement by pauses of one syllable 's value . This change I have sometimes made ; and in one case I have , in order to avoid a verbal obscurity , extended the line to ten syllables . Apart from these exceptions all the poems in this volume are translated into their original metres , and it has always been my first object to produce a literal , almost a word for word , translation . Whatever the faults of my version , it is strictly faithful . If I am deemed to have also preserved something of the beauty of the original I shall feel more than rewarded for a task that has presented many difficulties .</p>
