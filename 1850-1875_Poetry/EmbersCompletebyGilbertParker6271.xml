    <head>INTRODUCTION</head>
    <p n="1">I had not intended that Embers should ever be given to the public , but friends whose judgment I respect have urged me to include it in the subscription edition at least , and with real reluctance I have consented . It was a pleasure to me to have one piece of work of mine which made no bid for pence or praise ; but if that is a kind of selfishness , perhaps unnecessary , since no one may wish to read the verses , I will now free myself from any chance of reproach . This much I will say to soothe away my own compunctions , that the book will only make the bid for popularity or consideration with near a score of others , and not separately , and that my responsibility is thus modified . The preface to Embers says all that need be said about a collection which is , on the whole , merely a book of youth and memory and impressionism in verse . At least it was all spontaneous ; it was not made to order on any page of it , and it is the handful left from very many handfuls destroyed . Since the first edition ( intended only for my personal friends ) was published I have written “ Rosleen , ” “ Where Shall We Betake Us ? ” “ Granada , ” “ Mary Callaghan and Me , ” “ The Crowning ” ( on the Coronation of King Edward VII ) , the fragment “ Kildare ” and “ I Heard the Desert Calling ” ; and I have also included others like “ The Tall Dakoon ” and “ The Red Patrol , ” written over twenty years ago . “ Mary Callaghan and Me ” has been set to music by Mr. Max Muller , and has made many friends , and “ The Crowning ” was the Coronation ode of ‘ The People ’ , which gave a prize , too ample I think , for the best musical setting of the lines . Many of the other pieces in ‘ Embers ’ have been set to music by distinguished composers like Sir Edward Elgar , who has made a song-cycle of several , Sir Alexander Mackenzie , Mr. Arthur Foote , Mrs. Amy Woodforde Finden , Robert Somerville , and others . The first to have musical setting was “ You 'll Travel Far and Wide , ” to which in 1895 Mr. Arthur Foote gave fame as “ An Irish Folk Song . ” Like “ O Flower of All the World , ” by Mrs. Amy Woodforde Finden , it has had a world of admirers , and such singers as Mrs. Henschel helped to make Mr. Foote 's music loved by thousands , and conferred something more than an ephemeral acceptance of the author 's words .</p>
    <p n="2">When thou comest to the safe tent of the good comrade , abide there till thy going forth with a stedfast mind ; and if , at the hospitable fire , thou hast learned the secret of a heart , thou shalt keep it holy , as the North Wind the trouble of the Stars .</p>
    <p n="3">PROEM</p>
    <p n="4">And the Angel said : “ What hast thou for all thy travail — what dost thou bring with thee out of the dust of the world ? ”</p>
    <p n="5">And the man answered : “ Behold , I bring one perfect yesterday ! ”</p>
    <p n="6">And the Angel questioned : “ Hast thou then no to-morrow ? Hast thou no hope ? ”</p>
    <p n="7">And the man replied : “ Who am I that I should hope ! Out of all my life I have been granted one sheaf of memory . ”</p>
    <p n="8">And the Angel said : “ Is this all ! ”</p>
    <p n="9">And the man answered : “ Of all else was I robbed by the way : but Memory was hidden safely in my heart — the world found it not . ”</p>

     <p>THE FOOL I was a fool ; nothing had I to know Of men , and naught to men had I to give . God gave me nothing ; now to God I go , Now ask for pain , for bread , Life for my brain : dead , By God 's love I shall then begin to live .</p>
     <p>THE FIGHTER Blows I have struck , and blows a-many taken , Wrestling I 've fallen , and I 've rose up again ; Mostly I 've stood — I 've had good bone and blood ; Others went down though fighting might and main . Now Death steps in , Death the price of sin : The fall it will be his ; and though I strive and strain , One blow will close my eyes , and I shall never waken .</p>

       <l n="90">Of him , brought up there alive or dead .</l>
       <l n="91">Save him , and perish to save him , yes !</l>
       <l n="92">But three hours more , and that next express</l>
       <l n="93">Would thunder by her , and she , alas !</l>
       <l n="94">Must stand there still and let it pass .</l>
       <l n="95">Duty was duty , and hers was clear ;</l>
       <l n="96">God seemed far off , and no friend near .</l>
       <l n="97">But the truest friend and the swiftest horse</l>
       <l n="98">Must ride that ride on a breakneck course ;</l>
       <l n="99">And with truest horse and swiftest friend ,</l>
       <l n="100">To the fast express was the winning end !</l>
       <l n="101">And as if one pang was needed more ,</l>
       <l n="102">There stood in the doorway , Nell Latore —</l>
       <l n="103">Nell Latore , with her mocking face ,</l>
       <l n="104">Restless eyes , and her evil grace ;</l>
       <l n="105">Quick to read in the wife 's sad eyes ,</l>
       <l n="106">The deep , strange woe , and the hurt surprise .</l>
       <l n="107">Slow she said , with piercing breath ,</l>
       <l n="108">“ Rebel fighter dies rebel death ! ”</l>
       <l n="109">Said , and paused ; for she seemed to see</l>
       <l n="110">Far through the other 's misery ,</l>
       <l n="111">Something that stilled her ; triumph fled</l>
       <l n="112">Shamed and fast , as the young wife said —</l>
       <l n="113">“ He keeps his faith with an oath he swore ,</l>
       <l n="114">For the half-breed 's freedom , Nell Latore ;</l>
       <l n="115">And , did he lie here , eyes death-dim ,</l>
       <l n="116">You , if you spoke but truth of him ,</l>
       <l n="117">Truth , truth only , should stand and say ,</l>
       <l n="118">‘ He never wronged me , Jeanne Amray . ’ ”</l>
       <l n="119">Then , for a moment , standing there ,</l>
       <l n="120">Hushed and cold as a dead man 's prayer ,</l>
       <l n="121">Nell Latore , with the woman now ,</l>
       <l n="122">Scorching the past from her eyes and brow</l>
       <l n="123">“ Trust me , ” she said , like an angel-call ,</l>
       <l n="124">“ Tell me his danger , tell me all . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="125">Quick resolve to a quick-told tale —</l>
       <l n="126">Nell Latore , to the glistening rail</l>
       <l n="127">Fled , and on it a hand-car drew ,</l>
       <l n="128">Seized the handles , and backward threw</l>
       <l n="129">One swift , farewell look , and said ,</l>
       <l n="130">“ You shall have him alive , not dead ! ”</l>
       <l n="131">Ah , well for her that her arms were strong ,</l>
       <l n="132">And cord and nerve like a knotted thong ,</l>
       <l n="133">And well for Jeanne in her sharp distress ,</l>
       <l n="134">That Nell was racing the fast express</l>
       <l n="135">Her whole life bent to this one deed ,</l>
       <l n="136">And , like a soul from its prison freed ,</l>
       <l n="137">Rising , dilating , reached across</l>
       <l n="138">Hills of conquest from plains of loss .</l>
       <l n="139">Gorges echoed as she passed by ,</l>
       <l n="140">Wild fowl rose with a plaintive cry ;</l>
       <l n="141">On she sped ; and the white steel rang —</l>
       <l n="142">“ Save him — save him for her ! ” it sang .</l>
       <l n="143">Once , a lad at a worn-out mine</l>
       <l n="144">Strove to warn her with awe-struck sign —</l>
       <l n="145">Turned she neither to left nor right ,</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="146">Strained till the Rock Hills came in sight ;</l>
       <l n="147">“ But two miles more , ” to herself she said ,</l>
       <l n="148">“ Then she shall have him alive , not dead ! ”</l>
       <l n="149">The merciful gods that moment heard</l>
       <l n="150">Her promise , and helped her to keep her word ;</l>
       <l n="151">For , when the wheels of the fast express</l>
       <l n="152">Slowed through the gates of that wilderness ,</l>
       <l n="153">Round a headland and far away</l>
       <l n="154">Sailed the husband of Jeanne Amray .</l>
       <l n="155">While all that hundred-and-fifty then ,</l>
       <l n="156">Hot on the trail of the Dubois Men ,</l>
       <l n="157">Knew , as they stood by the pine-girt store ,</l>
       <l n="158">The girl that had foiled them — Nell Latore .</l>
       <l n="159">Slow she moved from among them , turned</l>
       <l n="160">Where the sky to the westward burned ;</l>
       <l n="161">Gazed for a moment , set her hands</l>
       <l n="162">Over her brow , so ! drew the strands</l>
       <l n="163">Loose and rich of her tawny hair ,</l>
       <l n="164">Once through her fingers , standing there ;</l>
       <l n="165">Then again to the rail she passed .</l>
       <l n="166">One more look to the West she cast ,</l>
       <l n="167">And into the East she drew away :</l>
       <l n="168">Backwards and forwards her brown arms play ,</l>
       <l n="169">Forwards and backwards , till far and dim ,</l>
       <l n="170">She grew one with the night 's dun rim ;</l>
       <l n="171">Backwards and forwards , and then , was gone</l>
       <l n="172">Into I know not what . . . alone .</l>
       <l n="173">She came not back , she may never come ;</l>
       <l n="174">But a young wife lives in a cabin home ,</l>
       <l n="175">Who prays each night that , alive or dead ,</l>
       <l n="176">Come God 's own rest for her lonely head :</l>
       <l n="177">And I — shall I see her then no more ,</l>
       <l n="178">My comrade , my old love , Nell Latore ?</l>
