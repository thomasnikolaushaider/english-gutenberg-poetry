       <l n="3">Far from their stuffy tenement homes</l>
       <l n="4">That cluster thicker than honeycombs ,</l>
       <l n="5">They ran the bases like busy bees ,</l>

       <l n="11">“ Mercy ! ” she murmured , “ this must stop ! ”</l>
       <l n="12">Then promptly proceeded to call a cop ;</l>

       <l n="18">Past splashing fountains and rich abodes .</l>
       <l n="19">Reaching her home , she was heard to say</l>

       <l n="24">To the warping walls of Tenement Town .</l>
       <l n="25">Reaching their homes , the troublesome tots</l>
       <l n="26">Crept away to their shabby cots</l>
       <l n="27">And dreamed of the grass and the droning bees ,</l>
       <l n="28">The pure , cool air and the waving trees ,</l>

       <l n="2">I guess that you will some day ,</l>
       <l n="3">For you 've shown the speed the managers need</l>

       <l n="8">As the seasons roll you will pay the toll</l>
       <l n="9">From your fresh young nerves and your clean young soul ,</l>
       <l n="10">Till your pulse less buoyantly bounds .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="11">And you 'll learn strange things in the Big League , boy ,</l>

       <l n="13">You will come to know , in that shifting show ,</l>
       <l n="14">The things that I learned in the long ago</l>

      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="16">For I came to play in the Big League , boy ,</l>

       <l n="18">To eyes divine where the white lights shine</l>
       <l n="19">I mumbled toasts over bubbling wine —</l>
       <l n="20">And finished minus a friend .</l>

       <l n="21">You want to play in the Big League , boy ?</l>

       <l n="23">And this is the prayer of an old-time player —</l>
       <l n="24">None was stronger and none was gayer —</l>

      <head>THE BALLAD OF THE MINOR LEAGUER</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">He came here in the early Spring with all the tryout mob ,</l>
       <l n="2">Striving to bat like Wagner and to slide ( spikes first ) like Cobb .</l>
       <l n="3">Some of the vets cried , “ Bonehead ! ” Others remarked , “ Poor zob ! ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="4">Modest as Spring 's arbutus , calm as an April dawn ,</l>
       <l n="5">He asked for no advances though his ticker was in pawn ;</l>
       <l n="6">He learned the law from Jawn McGraw but never called him “ Jawn . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="7">He graced the bench until July , leading the simple life —</l>
       <l n="8">He would n't touch a cocktail once to please a schoolmate 's wife ;</l>
       <l n="9">The slightest hint of a “ creme de mint ” would cut him like a knife .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="10">The village smith that stood beneath the spreading chestnut tree</l>
       <l n="11">Had nothing on this youngster in the dodging of a spree .</l>
       <l n="12">Others could tipple if they would — not for Recruit McGee .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="13">Thus did the minor leaguer seek for affluence and fame —</l>
       <l n="14">Virtue 's its own reward at times , but oft it pulls up lame .</l>
       <l n="15">Now he has went back to the place from which he once had came !</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">It looked extremely rocky for the Boston team that day ,</l>
       <l n="2">The score was one to nothing , with one inning left to play .</l>
       <l n="3">Casey , who played in centre field , had shown an hour too late —</l>
       <l n="4">He had n't any alibi when staggering through the gate .</l>
       <l n="5">So when he tore his necktie off and stepped upon his hat</l>
       <l n="6">The manager looked grim and said , “ It 's Casey on a bat . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="7">“ Well , ” said the Boston manager , “ with joy I ought to scream —</l>
       <l n="8">Here 's Casey with a dandy load , the best man on the team .</l>
       <l n="9">He told me he was sober , but he could n't quite get by</l>
       <l n="10">When he stepped upon his derby and was yanking off his tie .</l>
       <l n="11">Of all the hard luck in the world ! The mean , ungrateful rat !</l>
       <l n="12">A blooming championship at stake and Casey on a bat . ”</l>

       <l n="13">Two Boston batters in the ninth were speedily retired ,</l>
       <l n="14">“ Here , Casey ! ” cried the manager , speaking as one inspired ,</l>
       <l n="15">“ Go in and bat for Grogan ! There 's a man on second base ,</l>
       <l n="16">And if you hit the way you can we 'll win the pennant race . ”</l>
       <l n="17">This is no knock on buttermilk , or anything like that ,</l>

       <l n="1">A pitcher known in the days gone by</l>
       <l n="2">As a star of the first degree</l>
       <l n="3">Was making the dirt and gravel fly</l>
       <l n="4">In the shade of an old oak tree .</l>
       <l n="5">His spade was long and his arm was strong ,</l>
       <l n="6">And the ditch that he dug was wide ;</l>
       <l n="7">He paused at the sound of the dinner gong —</l>
       <l n="8">And this is the sermon he sighed :</l>

       <l n="14">I thought my prowess would last ,</l>

       <l n="2">Baseball , they say , has changed a heap ; I guess it has , in spots ,</l>
       <l n="3">And yet I liked it better when we played it on the lots .</l>
       <l n="4">There were no signs for “ hit and run , ” no dazzling “ fadeaways ” ;</l>
       <l n="5">We had no high-priced managers to tell us fancy plays .</l>
       <l n="6">No , we were just a lot of kids , with tanned and freckled hides ;</l>
       <l n="7">There were no concrete grand stands when we played at “ choosing sides . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="8">I saw a ball game yesterday , and o'er a brass band 's blare</l>
       <l n="9">The cheers of thirty thousand fans were soaring through the air .</l>
       <l n="10">The turnstiles had been clicking for three solid golden hours ,</l>
       <l n="11">Recording wealth and profit for the big league baseball powers .</l>
       <l n="12">How soon we lose our play days ! How swiftly childhood glides !</l>
       <l n="13">There were no clicking turnstiles when we played at “ choosing sides . ”</l>
       <l n="14">The captains used to toss a bat , and then , hand over hand —</l>
       <l n="15">But why repeat a story every boy must understand ?</l>
       <l n="16">Then came the careful picking — “ I 'll take Reddy . ” “ Give me Flynn . ”</l>
       <l n="17">“ I 'll choose you , Skinny Murphy . ” “ I 'll take you , Pat McGinn . ”</l>
       <l n="18">They picked the live ones first , of course , and finished with the snides ;</l>
       <l n="19">Feelings were often ruffled when we played at “ choosing sides . ”</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="20">Dear reader , you 'll remember , if you peek into the past ,</l>
       <l n="21">The little four-eyed fellow that was always chosen last .</l>
       <l n="22">The little weak-kneed urchin that the captain would ignore</l>
       <l n="23">Until he found by counting , that he needed one man more .</l>
       <l n="24">He could n't bat , he could n't field , and yet that shrimp to-day</l>
       <l n="25">Is making laws in Congress , while his captain drives a dray .</l>

       <l n="1">Say , on the level , fellows , just a year ago to-day</l>
       <l n="2">I would n't give a nickel for to watch them Yankees play ;</l>
       <l n="3">The Joints was good enough for me , and since I was a kid</l>
       <l n="4">I hustled to the Polo Grounds and seen each stunt they did .</l>
       <l n="5">Yankees ? Well , say , I could n't see the Yankees with a glass ;</l>
       <l n="6">I 'd always say their style of play was very much high grass .</l>

       <l n="7">Yes , it was all the Polo Grounds — I never missed a game ;</l>

       <l n="9">When Matty pitched I 'd lose my head and outlung all the boys —</l>
       <l n="10">The ushers put me out once , when I made too blame much noise .</l>
       <l n="11">When Farrell 's club was here instead , I used to go to Coney ,</l>
       <l n="12">Because I always figgered that the Yanks was only phony .</l>

       <l n="15">They did n't have no home at all after the fire that time ,</l>
       <l n="16">But Farrell says , “ Use my grounds , boys ; I hope it helps you climb . ”</l>
