     <l n="2">Jesus , the poet of Galilee ,</l>
     <l n="3">Fashioned the light in His lyric hands ,</l>
     <l n="4">And held it up for all men to see :</l>
     <l n="5">The Publican and the Pharisee ,</l>
     <l n="6">The merchant rich and the robber bands</l>
     <l n="7">On the outcast fringe of Galilee .</l>
     <l n="8">But all of the wise men sneered at Him ;</l>
     <l n="9">And the gay young fellows jeered at Him ;</l>
     <l n="10">And only a fisherman fool or two</l>
     <l n="11">Looked up at the Light with its liquid hue</l>
     <l n="12">And drank its beauty of red and blue .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="13">Jesus , the poet of Galilee ,</l>
     <l n="14">Sang that the weary might be free ;</l>
     <l n="15">Sang of the lilies — how their glory</l>
     <l n="16">Shamed the best at a king 's command ;</l>
     <l n="17">Sang His truths in a lyric story</l>
     <l n="18">Even the poor could understand .</l>
     <l n="19">And the wise men heard and they tried to scan</l>
     <l n="20">The rhymes of the poet Son-of-Man .</l>
     <l n="21">But , every time that He sang , they found</l>
     <l n="22">Some cherished rule of their pedant school</l>
     <l n="23">Was killed in his poem 's strange , new sound .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="24">And Jesus , the poet , grew sick at heart</l>
     <l n="25">And fled from the halls where learning kills ;</l>
     <l n="26">And took His verse from the fear of art</l>
     <l n="27">To the bold delight of the rain-washed hills .</l>
     <l n="28">And the songs He sang to the desert sea</l>
     <l n="29">Were far too sweet for the ears of men ;</l>
     <l n="30">But the gray-white dunes of Galilee</l>
     <l n="31">Have blown with a fairer flower since then .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="32">A learned group of dons will gloat</l>
     <l n="33">At a fool 's last word in a high priest 's throat .</l>
     <l n="34">But the song of God in a Carpenter 's saw</l>
     <l n="35">Could never hold wise men in awe .</l>
     <l n="36">And whenever Christ , the bard , would sing</l>
     <l n="37">They lost His truth in a hammer 's ring .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="38">The wilderness called with her silent lure :</l>
     <l n="39">“ O poet of thoughtless Nazareth</l>
     <l n="40">Come out to me with your starry breath . ”</l>
     <l n="41">And His white reed yearned for the moon-chilled sands</l>
     <l n="42">Where the frayed flowers cure</l>
     <l n="43">With their gypsy hands .</l>
     <l n="44">But He turned His face</l>
     <l n="45">From the silent place ,</l>
     <l n="46">With the comrade stars above ,</l>
     <l n="47">As we all have done ,</l>
     <l n="48">As we all have done</l>
     <l n="49">From a maid we dare not love .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="50">And the silent desert called again :</l>
     <l n="51">“ O poet of thoughtless Nazareth ,</l>
     <l n="52">Come out to me with your fragrant breath ,</l>
     <l n="53">And walk with me in the moon 's white rain . ”</l>
     <l n="54">But a blind man 's stick on a hollow stone ,</l>
     <l n="55">As it slowly tapped through a distant city ,</l>
     <l n="56">And a broken woman 's hopeless moan</l>
     <l n="57">Called out to Him with a deeper tone ;</l>
     <l n="58">And the heart of the Lord was pity .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="59">And back to the town the poet came ,</l>
     <l n="60">And took His feet to the temple 's hall ,</l>
     <l n="61">And heard the boast of a man named Saul ;</l>
     <l n="62">And He heard Saul mock ,</l>
     <l n="63">In a fiery tongue ,</l>
     <l n="64">The sweetest songs which His heart had sung .</l>
     <l n="65">But Jesus of Nazareth , then and there ,</l>
     <l n="66">Could scarce forbear</l>
     <l n="67">From a fond embrace ,</l>
     <l n="68">Knowing the beauty the man should wear</l>
     <l n="69">At another time , in another place .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="70">The critics were many in Jesus ’ day ;</l>
     <l n="71">And His songs were scorned by the caustic pen .</l>
     <l n="72">He did not write in the Grecian way ;</l>
     <l n="73">And He knew not how to preach or pray</l>
     <l n="74">In a way approved of men .</l>
     <l n="75">His themes were bad by the Roman chart ,</l>
     <l n="76">And His metres all were wrong ;</l>
     <l n="77">For all of the High Priests had their art ,</l>
     <l n="78">And He had only His song .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="79">Now few of the people cared to hear</l>
     <l n="80">The Poet blow on His starry reeds ;</l>
     <l n="81">So He took His gift from the soul 's high sphere —</l>
     <l n="82">The miracle song that few would hear —</l>
     <l n="83">And lowered His power ,</l>
     <l n="84">In a hopeless hour ,</l>
     <l n="85">And made men cower</l>
     <l n="86">At His miracle deeds .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="87">A miracle deed is a simple thing</l>
     <l n="88">To a miracle song or a miracle truth .</l>
     <l n="89">Yet they marvelled not that a song could bring</l>
     <l n="90">To the veins of Time the world 's lost youth .</l>
     <l n="91">And two were gathered and sometimes three</l>
     <l n="92">To hear the poet of Galilee .</l>
     <l n="93">But the mob swept down like leaves in a storm</l>
     <l n="94">When they heard the miracle man would perform .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="95">And the lame men walked and the blind men saw ;</l>
     <l n="96">And the dead men breathed by a strange , new law .</l>
     <l n="97">But they were few to the far-flung throng</l>
     <l n="98">Who saw and breathed through the poet 's song .</l>
     <l n="99">When they sat and fed on the fish and bread</l>
     <l n="100">Five thousand men was an easy count ;</l>
     <l n="101">And the deed was done ;</l>
     <l n="102">But to-morrow 's sun</l>
     <l n="103">Will still bring throngs to the Pulpit-Mount .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="104">And I am sure that John or Mary</l>
     <l n="105">Cared not a whit when He walked the sea .</l>
     <l n="106">But I am sure that they loved to tarry</l>
     <l n="107">And hear the Poet of Galilee .</l>
     <l n="108">And of the throng that around Him pressed</l>
     <l n="109">‘ Twas John and Mary that He loved best .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="110">And when the Poet sat down , to choose</l>
     <l n="111">The men to take to the world His news ,</l>
     <l n="112">He sought no men who had held their dishes</l>
     <l n="113">To catch His gift of the loaves and fishes .</l>
     <l n="114">But He chose them out of the purer throngs</l>
     <l n="115">Who came to hear His miracle songs .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="116">And when at last He went up a Hill ,</l>
     <l n="117">To seal His songs with the seal of Death ,</l>
     <l n="118">Whose were the hands that were raised to kill</l>
     <l n="119">This brave young poet of Nazareth ?</l>
     <l n="120">The man who thrust at His side I find</l>
     <l n="121">Was a man who saw Him heal the blind .</l>
     <l n="122">And the men who fed on the fish and bread</l>
     <l n="123">Were cheering the deed in the ranks behind .</l>
     <l n="124">But in a group which had drawn apart ,</l>
     <l n="125">To pour their tears for His broken heart ,</l>
     <l n="126">Were the ones who heard</l>
     <l n="127">His miracle word .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="128">If all of the miracle deeds of Christ</l>
     <l n="129">Had proven birth in a womb of lies</l>
     <l n="130">My spirit would still with Him keep tryst</l>
     <l n="131">With faith as deep as the sun-washed skies .</l>
     <l n="132">But why should I doubt so simple a thing</l>
     <l n="133">As a miracle deed from a man who could sing</l>
     <l n="134">A miracle song that sheds its power</l>
     <l n="135">In a pure , white light to the world 's last hour .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="136">The temple bells ring out to-day</l>
     <l n="137">And the Pharisees pray</l>
     <l n="138">In their ancient way .</l>
     <l n="139">And the lips of the preachers love to tarry</l>
     <l n="140">On the virgin birth and the miracle deed ;</l>
     <l n="141">But the temple bells I shall not heed ;</l>
     <l n="142">For I am going with John and Mary</l>
     <l n="143">Out on the hills with the slender throngs</l>
     <l n="144">Who love to hear the Miracle Songs .</l>
