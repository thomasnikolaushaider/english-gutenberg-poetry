     <l n="1">April is the cruellest month , breeding</l>
     <l n="2">Lilacs out of the dead land , mixing</l>
     <l n="3">Memory and desire , stirring</l>
     <l n="4">Dull roots with spring rain .</l>
     <l n="5">Winter kept us warm , covering</l>
     <l n="6">Earth in forgetful snow , feeding</l>
     <l n="7">A little life with dried tubers .</l>
     <l n="8">Summer surprised us , coming over the Starnbergersee</l>
     <l n="9">With a shower of rain ; we stopped in the colonnade ,</l>
     <l n="10">And went on in sunlight , into the Hofgarten , 10</l>
     <l n="11">And drank coffee , and talked for an hour .</l>

     <l n="16">Marie , hold on tight . And down we went .</l>

     <l n="22">A heap of broken images , where the sun beats ,</l>
     <l n="23">And the dead tree gives no shelter , the cricket no relief ,</l>
     <l n="24">And the dry stone no sound of water . Only</l>

HURRY UP PLEASE ITS TIME If you do n't like it you can get on with it , I said . Others can pick and choose if you can n't . But if Albert makes off , it wo n't be for lack of telling . You ought to be ashamed , I said , to look so antique . ( And her only thirty-one . ) I can n't help it , she said , pulling a long face , It 's them pills I took , to bring it off , she said . ( She 's had five already , and nearly died of young George . ) 160 The chemist said it would be alright , but I 've never been the same . You are a proper fool , I said . Well , if Albert wo n't leave you alone , there it is , I said , What you get married for if you do n't want children ? HURRY UP PLEASE ITS TIME Well , that Sunday Albert was home , they had a hot gammon , And they asked me in to dinner , to get the beauty of it hot -  HURRY UP PLEASE ITS TIME HURRY UP PLEASE ITS TIME Goonight Bill .

    <head>NOTES ON “ THE WASTE LAND ”</head>
    <head>Not only the title , but the plan and a good deal of the incidental symbolism of the poem were suggested by Miss Jessie L. Weston 's book on the Grail legend : From Ritual to Romance ( Macmillan ) .&lt; 1 > Indeed , so deeply am I indebted , Miss Weston 's book will elucidate the difficulties of the poem much better than my notes can do ; and I recommend it ( apart from the great interest of the book itself ) to any who think such elucidation of the poem worth the trouble . To another work of anthropology I am indebted in general , one which has influenced our generation profoundly ; I mean The Golden Bough ; I have used especially the two volumes Adonis , Attis , Osiris . Anyone who is acquainted with these works will immediately recognise in the poem certain references to vegetation ceremonies .</head>

   <p>46 . I am not familiar with the exact constitution of the Tarot pack of cards , from which I have obviously departed to suit my own convenience . The Hanged Man , a member of the traditional pack , fits my purpose in two ways : because he is associated in my mind with the Hanged God of Frazer , and because I associate him with the hooded figure in the passage of the disciples to Emmaus in Part V. The Phoenician Sailor and the Merchant appear later ; also the “ crowds of people , ” and Death by Water is executed in Part IV . The Man with Three Staves ( an authentic member of the Tarot pack ) I associate , quite arbitrarily , with the Fisher King himself .</p>

Just as the one-eyed merchant , seller of currants , melts into the Phoenician Sailor , and the latter is not wholly distinct from Ferdinand Prince of Naples , so all the women are one woman , and the two sexes meet in Tiresias . What Tiresias sees , in fact , is the substance of the poem . The whole passage from Ovid is of great anthropological interest :</p>

   <p>308 . The complete text of the Buddha 's Fire Sermon ( which corresponds in importance to the Sermon on the Mount ) from which these words are taken , will be found translated in the late Henry Clarke Warren 's Buddhism in Translation ( Harvard Oriental Series ) . Mr. Warren was one of the great pioneers of Buddhist studies in the Occident .</p>
   <p>309 . From St. Augustine 's Confessions again . The collocation of these two representatives of eastern and western asceticism , as the culmination of this part of the poem , is not an accident .</p>
   <p>V. WHAT THE THUNDER SAID</p>
   <p>In the first part of Part V three themes are employed : the journey to Emmaus , the approach to the Chapel Perilous ( see Miss Weston 's book ) and the present decay of eastern Europe .</p>
   <p>357 . This is Turdus aonalaschkae pallasii , the hermit-thrush which I have heard in Quebec County . Chapman says ( Handbook of Birds of Eastern North America ) “ it is most at home in secluded woodland and thickety retreats . . . . Its notes are not remarkable for variety or volume , but in purity and sweetness of tone and exquisite modulation they are unequalled . ” Its “ water-dripping song ” is justly celebrated .</p>
   <p>360 . The following lines were stimulated by the account of one of the Antarctic expeditions ( I forget which , but I think one of Shackleton 's ): it was related that the party of explorers , at the extremity of their strength , had the constant delusion that there was one more member than could actually be counted .</p>
   <p>367-77 . Cf . Hermann Hesse , Blick ins Chaos :</p>
   <p>“ Schon ist halb Europa , schon ist zumindest der halbe Osten Europas auf dem Wege zum Chaos , fährt betrunken im heiligem Wahn am Abgrund entlang und singt dazu , singt betrunken und hymnisch wie Dmitri Karamasoff sang . Ueber diese Lieder lacht der Bürger beleidigt , der Heilige und Seher hört sie mit Tränen . ”</p>
   <p>402 . “ Datta , dayadhvam , damyata ” ( Give , sympathize , control ) . The fable of the meaning of the Thunder is found in the Brihadaranyaka-Upanishad , 5 , 1 . A translation is found in Deussen 's Sechzig Upanishads des Veda , p. 489 .</p>
   <p>408 . Cf . Webster , The White Devil , v. vi :</p>
   <p>“ . . . they 'll remarry Ere the worm pierce your winding-sheet , ere the spider Make a thin curtain for your epitaphs . ”</p>
   <p>412 . Cf . Inferno , xxxiii . 46 :</p>
   <p>“ ed io sentii chiavar l'uscio di sotto all'orribile torre . ”</p>
   <p>Also F. H. Bradley , Appearance and Reality , p. 346 :</p>
   <p>“ My external sensations are no less private to myself than are my thoughts or my feelings . In either case my experience falls within my own circle , a circle closed on the outside ; and , with all its elements alike , every sphere is opaque to the others which surround it . . . . In brief , regarded as an existence which appears in a soul , the whole world for each is peculiar and private to that soul . ”</p>
   <p>425 . V. Weston , From Ritual to Romance ; chapter on the Fisher King .</p>
   <p>428 . V. Purgatorio , xxvi . 148 .</p>
   <p>“ ‘ Ara vos prec per aquella valor ‘ que vos guida al som de l'escalina , ‘ sovegna vos a temps de ma dolor . ’ Poi s'ascose nel foco che gli affina . ”</p>
   <p>429 . V. Pervigilium Veneris . Cf . Philomela in Parts II and III .</p>
   <p>430 . V. Gerard de Nerval , Sonnet El Desdichado .</p>
   <p>432 . V. Kyd 's Spanish Tragedy .</p>
   <p>434 . Shantih . Repeated as here , a formal ending to an Upanishad . ‘ The Peace which passeth understanding ’ is a feeble translation of the content of this word .</p>
