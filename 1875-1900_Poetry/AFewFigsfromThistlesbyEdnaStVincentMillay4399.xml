     <l n="9">We were very tired , we were very merry —</l>
     <l n="10">We had gone back and forth all night on the ferry .</l>
     <l n="11">It was bare and bright , and smelled like a stable —</l>
     <l n="12">But we looked into a fire , we leaned across a table ,</l>
     <l n="13">We lay on a hill-top underneath the moon ;</l>
     <l n="14">And the whistles kept blowing , and the dawn came soon .</l>

     <l n="23">We hailed , “ Good morrow , mother ! ” to a shawl-covered head ,</l>
     <l n="24">And bought a morning paper , which neither of us read ;</l>
     <l n="25">And she wept , “ God bless you ! ” for the apples and pears ,</l>
     <l n="26">And we gave her all our money but our subway fares .</l>

     <l n="50">As I went walking up and down to take the evening air ,</l>
     <l n="51">( Sweet to meet upon the street , why must I be so shy ? )</l>
     <l n="52">I saw him lay his hand upon her torn black hair ;</l>
     <l n="53">( “ Little dirty Latin child , let the lady by ! ” )</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="54">The women squatting on the stoops were slovenly and fat ,</l>
     <l n="55">( Lay me out in organdie , lay me out in lawn ! )</l>
     <l n="56">And everywhere I stepped there was a baby or a cat ;</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="58">The fruit-carts and clam-carts were ribald as a fair ,</l>
     <l n="59">( Pink nets and wet shells trodden under heel )</l>
     <l n="60">She had haggled from the fruit-man of his rotting ware ;</l>
     <l n="61">( I shall never get to sleep , the way I feel ! )</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="19">
     <l n="62">He walked like a king through the filth and the clutter ,</l>
     <l n="63">( Sweet to meet upon the street , why did you glance me by ? )</l>
     <l n="64">But he caught the quaint Italian quip she flung him from the gutter ;</l>
     <l n="65">( What can there be to cry about that I should lie and cry ? )</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="20">
     <l n="66">He laid his darling hand upon her little black head ,</l>
     <l n="67">( I wish I were a ragged child with ear-rings in my ears ! )</l>
     <l n="68">And he said she was a baggage to have said what she had said ;</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="22">
     <l n="71">What should I be but a prophet and a liar ,</l>
     <l n="72">Whose mother was a leprechaun , whose father was a friar ?</l>
     <l n="73">Teethed on a crucifix and cradled under water ,</l>
     <l n="74">What should I be but the fiend 's god-daughter ?</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="23">
     <l n="75">And who should be my playmates but the adder and the frog ,</l>
     <l n="76">That was got beneath a furze-bush and born in a bog ?</l>
     <l n="77">And what should be my singing , that was christened at an altar ,</l>
     <l n="78">But Aves and Credos and Psalms out of the Psalter ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="24">
     <l n="79">You will see such webs on the wet grass , maybe ,</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="25">
     <l n="83">But there comes to birth no common spawn</l>

     <l n="90">My Da would come a-swishing of the drops away ,</l>
     <l n="91">With a prayer for my death and a groan for my birth ,</l>
     <l n="92">A-mumbling of his beads for all that he was worth .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="28">
     <l n="93">And there 'd sit my Ma , with her knees beneath her chin ,</l>
     <l n="94">A-looking in his face and a-drinking of it in ,</l>
     <l n="95">And a-marking in the moss some funny little saying</l>
     <l n="96">That would mean just the opposite of all that he was praying !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="29">
     <l n="97">He taught me the holy-talk of Vesper and of Matin ,</l>
     <l n="98">He heard me my Greek and he heard me my Latin ,</l>
     <l n="99">He blessed me and crossed me to keep my soul from evil ,</l>
     <l n="100">And we watched him out of sight , and we conjured up the devil !</l>

     <l n="103">And yanked both ways by my mother and my father ,</l>
     <l n="104">With a “ Which would you better ? ” and a “ Which would you rather ? ”</l>
