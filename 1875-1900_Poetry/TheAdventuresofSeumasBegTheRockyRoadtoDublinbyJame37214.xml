       <l n="9">With bubbled pearl he made the rivers flow</l>
       <l n="10">And laced their mists in silver , and he clad</l>
       <l n="11">The meads in fragrant pomp of green and gold ,</l>
       <l n="12">And bade the world forget it had been sad .</l>

       <l n="1">The sun is always in the sky</l>

       <l n="3">And I often wonder why</l>
       <l n="4">It 's never late .— My sister said</l>
       <l n="5">She did not know who did the trick ,</l>
       <l n="6">And that she did not care a bit ,</l>
       <l n="7">And I should eat my porridge quick .</l>

       <l n="1">There was a giant by the Orchard Wall</l>
       <l n="2">Peeping about on this side and on that ,</l>
       <l n="3">And feeling in the trees : he was as tall</l>
       <l n="4">As the big apple tree , and twice as fat :</l>
       <l n="5">His beard was long , and bristly-black , and there</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="7">He held a great big club in his right hand ,</l>
       <l n="8">And with the other felt in every tree</l>
       <l n="9">For something that he wanted . You could stand</l>
       <l n="10">Beside him and not reach up to his knee</l>
       <l n="11">So mighty big he was — I feared he would</l>
       <l n="12">Turn round , and trample down to where I stood .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="13">I tried to get away , but , as I slid</l>

       <l n="15">Far down and said , “ Where is the Princess hid ? ”</l>
       <l n="16">I pointed to a place , and off he went —</l>
       <l n="17">But while he searched I turned and simply flew</l>
       <l n="18">Round by the lilac bushes back to you .</l>

      <head>THE DEVIL 'S BAG</head>
       <l n="1">I saw the Devil walking down the lane</l>
       <l n="2">Behind our house .— There was a heavy bag</l>
       <l n="3">Strapped tightly on his shoulders , and the rain</l>
       <l n="4">Sizzled when it hit him . He picked a rag</l>
       <l n="5">Up from the ground and put it in his sack ,</l>
       <l n="6">And grinned and rubbed his hands .</l>
       <l n="7">There was a thing</l>
       <l n="8">Moving inside the bag upon his back —</l>
       <l n="9">It must have been a soul ! I saw it fling</l>
       <l n="10">And twist about inside , and not a hole</l>
       <l n="11">Or cranny for escape ! Oh , it was sad !</l>
       <l n="12">I cried , and shouted out , “ Let out that soul ! ”</l>
       <l n="13">But he turned round , and , sure , his face went mad ,</l>
       <l n="14">And twisted up and down , and he said “ Hell ! ”</l>
       <l n="15">And ran away .... Oh , mammy ! I 'm not well .</l>

      <head>A VISIT FROM ABROAD</head>
       <l n="1">A speck went blowing up against the sky</l>
       <l n="2">As little as a leaf : then it drew near</l>
       <l n="3">And broadened .— “ It 's a bird , ” said I ,</l>
       <l n="4">And fetched my bow and arrows . It was queer !</l>
       <l n="5">It grew up from a speck into a blot ,</l>
       <l n="6">And squattered past a cloud ; then it flew down</l>
       <l n="7">All crumply , and waggled such a lot</l>
       <l n="8">I thought the thing would fall .— It was a brown</l>
       <l n="9">Old carpet where a man was sitting snug</l>
       <l n="10">Who , when he reached the ground , began to sew</l>
       <l n="11">A big hole in the middle of the rug ,</l>
       <l n="12">And kept on peeping everywhere to know</l>
       <l n="13">Who might be coming — then he gave a twist</l>
       <l n="14">And flew away .... I fired at him but missed .</l>

       <l n="4">Down underneath the bedclothes — then the boom</l>
       <l n="5">Of a tremendous voice said , “ Sit up , lad ,</l>

       <l n="7">Although I did n't want to . I was glad</l>

      <head>THE CORAL ISLAND</head>
       <l n="1">His arms were round a chest of oaken wood ,</l>
       <l n="2">It was clamped with brass and iron studs , and seemed</l>
       <l n="3">An awful weight . After a while he stood</l>
       <l n="4">And I stole near to him .— His white eyes gleamed</l>
       <l n="5">As he peeped secretly about ; he laid</l>
       <l n="6">The oaken chest upon the ground , then drew</l>
       <l n="7">A great knife from his belt , and stuck the blade</l>
       <l n="8">Into the ground and dug . The clay soon flew</l>
       <l n="9">In all directions underneath a tree ,</l>
       <l n="10">And when the hole was deep he put the box</l>

       <l n="2">Spy a weed with deep delight ;</l>
       <l n="3">So , when far from saints and bliss ,</l>
       <l n="4">God might give a sin a kiss .</l>

       <l n="1">In the winter children go</l>
       <l n="2">Walking in the fields of snow</l>
       <l n="3">Where there is no grass at all ,</l>
       <l n="4">And the top of every wall ,</l>
       <l n="5">Every fence , and every tree</l>
       <l n="6">Is as white as white can be .</l>

       <l n="7">Pointing out the way they came ,</l>
       <l n="8">( Every one of them the same )</l>
       <l n="9">All across the fields there be</l>
       <l n="10">Prints in silver filigree ;</l>
       <l n="11">And their mothers find them so</l>
       <l n="12">By the footprints in the snow .</l>

       <l n="1">The mountains stand and stare around ,</l>
       <l n="2">They are far too proud to speak ;</l>
       <l n="3">Altho ’ they 're rooted in the ground ,</l>
       <l n="4">Up they go , peak after peak ,</l>
       <l n="5">Beyond the tallest tree , and still</l>
       <l n="6">Soaring over house and hill</l>
       <l n="7">Until you 'd think they 'd never stop</l>
       <l n="8">Going up , top over top ,</l>
       <l n="9">Into the clouds —</l>
       <l n="10">Still I mark</l>
       <l n="11">That a sparrow or a lark</l>
       <l n="12">Flying just as high , can sing</l>
       <l n="13">As if he 'd not done anything .</l>

       <l n="11">Then I said to me — God is good</l>

    <p>BY THE SAME AUTHOR . THE CROCK OF GOLD . Crown 8vo . 5s . net . THE PALL MALL GAZETTE .— “ A wise , beautiful , and humorous book .... If you could have given Sterne a soul and made him a poet he might have produced The Crock of Gold . ” THE DEMI-GODS . Crown 8vo . 5s . net . STANDARD .— “ The book is full of fine knowledge and fantasies in every shade of gaiety and gravity , and we would call its author a magician did we not feel that everything he writes is perfectly natural to him .... This book would prove , if proof were needed , that Mr. Stephens 's Crock of Gold was not a mere tour de force , but a real ebullition of genius and a token of all the good work that was to come . ” HERE ARE LADIES . Crown 8vo . 5s . net . THE TIMES .— “ A story may have many and diverse effects upon its reader . It may leave him smiling , laughing , frowning ( perhaps weeping ) , angry , perplexed , exalted , afraid . The bits of stories in Here are Ladies , the sketches , essays , snapshots , call them what you will , will leave him for the most part happy and hungry — for more . ” THE CHARWOMAN 'S DAUGHTER . Crown 8vo . 3s . 6d . net . PUNCH .— “ A little gem .... It is a very long time indeed since we read such a human , satisfying book . Every page contains some happy phrase or illuminating piece of character drawing . ” SONGS FROM THE CLAY . Crown 8vo . 3s . 6d . net . EVENING STANDARD .— “ They have the sense of elfin mischief and keen spiritual sympathy with inarticulate nature which is so recognisable a feature of all Mr. Stephens 's writings , prose and verse . Many of the poems are models of that simplicity which is the supreme art of poesy , and in all may be found an underlying verity , masked may be with smiles or tears . ” MACMILLAN AND CO ., LTD ., LONDON .</p>
