   <head>PREFATORY NOTE</head>
   <p>This volume , while it is complete in itself , is also the first of a trilogy , the scope of which is suggested in the prologue . The story of scientific discovery has its own epic unity — a unity of purpose and endeavour — the single torch passing from hand to hand through the centuries ; and the great moments of science when , after long labour , the pioneers saw their accumulated facts falling into a significant order — sometimes in the form of a law that revolutionised the whole world of thought — have an intense human interest , and belong essentially to the creative imagination of poetry . It is with these moments that my poem is chiefly concerned , not with any impossible attempt to cover the whole field or to make a new poetic system , after the Lucretian model , out of modern science .</p>
   <p>The theme has been in my mind for a good many years ; and the first volume , dealing with the “ Watchers of the Sky , ” began to take definite shape during what was to me an unforgettable experience — the night I was privileged to spend on a summit of the Sierra Madre Mountains , when the first trial was made of the new 100-inch telescope . The prologue to this volume attempts to give a picture of that night , and to elucidate my own purpose .</p>
   <p>The first tale in this volume plunges into the middle of things , with the revolution brought about by Copernicus ; but , within the tale , partly by means of an incidental lyric , there is an attempt to give a bird'shYpppHeNeye view of what had gone before . The torch then passes to Tycho Brahe , who , driven into exile with his tables of the stars , at the very point of death hands them over to a young man named Kepler . Kepler , with their help , arrives at his own great laws , and corresponds with Galileo — the intensely human drama of whose life I have endeavoured to depict with more historical accuracy than can be attributed to much of the poetic literature that has gathered around his name . Too many writers have succumbed to the temptation of the cry , “ e pur si muove ! ” It is , of course , rejected by every reliable historian , and was first attributed to Galileo a hundred years after his death . M. Ponsard , in his play on the subject , succumbed to the extent of making his final scene end with Galileo “ frappant du pied la terre , ” and crying , “ pourtant elle tourne . ” Galileo 's recantation was a far more subtle and tragically complicated affair than that . Even Landor succumbed to the easy method of making him display his entirely legendary scars to Milton . If these familiar pictures are not to be found in my poem , it may be well for me to assure the hasty reader that it is because I have endeavoured to present a more just picture . I have tried to suggest the complications of motive in this section by a series of letters passing between the characters chiefly concerned . There was , of course , a certain poetic significance in the legend of “ e pur si muove ” ; and this significance I have endeavoured to retain without violating historical truth .</p>
   <p>In the year of Galileo 's death Newton was born , and the subsequent sections carry the story on to the modern observatory again . The form I have adopted is a development from that of an earlier book , “ Tales of the Mermaid Tavern ” where certain poets and discoverers of another kind were brought together round a central idea , and their stories told in a combination of narrative and lyrical verse . “ The Torch-Bearers ” flowed all the more naturally into a similar form in view of the fact that Tycho Brahe , Kepler , and many other pioneers of science wrote a considerable number of poems . Those imbedded in the works of Kepler — whose blazing and fantastic genius was , indeed , primarily poetic — are of extraordinary interest . I was helped , too , in the general scheme by those constant meetings between science and poetry , of which the most famous and beautiful are the visit of Sir Henry Wotton to Kepler , and the visit of Milton to Galileo in prison .</p>
   <p>Even if science and poetry were as deadly opposites as the shallow often affirm , the method and scheme indicated above would at least make it possible to convey something of the splendour of the long battle for the light in its most human aspect . Poetry has its own precision of expression and , in modern times , it has been seeking more and more for truth , sometimes even at the expense of beauty . It may be possible to carry that quest a stage farther , to the point where , in the great rhythmical laws of the universe revealed by science , truth and beauty are reunited . If poetry can do this , it will not be without some value to science itself , and it will be playing its part in the reconstruction of a shattered world . The passing of the old order of dogmatic religion has left the modern world in a strange chaos , craving for something in which it can unfeignedly believe , and often following will-o ’ - the-wisps . Forty years ago , Matthew Arnold prophesied that it would be for poetry , “ where it is worthy of its high destinies , ” to help to carry on the purer fire , and to express in new terms those eternal ideas which must ever be the only sure stay of the human race . It is not within the province of science to attempt a post-Copernican justification of the ways of God to man ; but , in the laws of nature revealed by science , and in “ that grand sequence of events which ” — as Darwin affirmed — “ the mind refuses to accept as the result of blind chance , ” poetry may discover its own new grounds for the attempt . It is easy to assume that all hope and faith are shallow . It is even easier to practise a really shallow and devitalising pessimism . The modern annunciation that there is a skeleton an inch beneath the skin of man is neither new nor profound . Neither science nor poetry can rest there ; and if , in this poem , an attempt is made to show that spiritual values are not diminished or overwhelmed by the “ fifteen hundred universes ” that passed in review before the telescope of Herschel , it is only after the opposite argument — so common and so easy to-day — has been faced ; and only after poetry has at least endeavoured to follow the torch of science to its own deep-set boundary-mark in that immense darkness of Space and Time .</p>

    <head>THE OBSERVATORY</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">At noon , upon the mountain 's purple height ,</l>
     <l n="2">Above the pine-woods and the clouds it shone</l>
     <l n="3">No larger than the small white dome of shell</l>
     <l n="4">Left by the fledgling wren when wings are born .</l>
     <l n="5">By night it joined the company of heaven ,</l>
     <l n="6">And , with its constant light , became a star .</l>
     <l n="7">A needle-point of light , minute , remote ,</l>
     <l n="8">It sent a subtler message through the abyss ,</l>
     <l n="9">Held more significance for the seeing eye</l>
     <l n="10">Than all the darkness that would blot it out ,</l>
     <l n="11">Yet could not dwarf it .</l>
     <l n="12">High in heaven it shone ,</l>
     <l n="13">Alive with all the thoughts , and hopes , and dreams</l>
     <l n="14">Of man 's adventurous mind .</l>
     <l n="15">Up there , I knew</l>
     <l n="16">The explorers of the sky , the pioneers</l>
     <l n="17">Of science , now made ready to attack</l>
     <l n="18">That darkness once again , and win new worlds .</l>
     <l n="19">To-morrow night they hoped to crown the toil</l>
     <l n="20">Of twenty years , and turn upon the sky</l>
     <l n="21">The noblest weapon ever made by man .</l>
     <l n="22">War had delayed them . They had been drawn away</l>
     <l n="23">Designing darker weapons . But no gun</l>
     <l n="24">Could outrange this .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="25">“ To-morrow night ” — so wrote their chief — “ we try</l>
     <l n="26">Our great new telescope , the hundred-inch .</l>
     <l n="27">Your Milton 's ‘ optic tube ’ has grown in power</l>
     <l n="28">Since Galileo , famous , blind , and old ,</l>
     <l n="29">Talked with him , in that prison , of the sky .</l>
     <l n="30">We creep to power by inches . Europe trusts</l>
     <l n="31">Her ‘ giant forty ’ still . Even to-night</l>
     <l n="32">Our own old sixty has its work to do ;</l>
     <l n="33">And now our hundred-inch . . . I hardly dare</l>
     <l n="34">To think what this new muzzle of ours may find .</l>
     <l n="35">Come up , and spend that night among the stars</l>
     <l n="36">Here , on our mountain-top . If all goes well ,</l>
     <l n="37">Then , at the least , my friend , you 'll see a moon</l>
     <l n="38">Stranger , but nearer , many a thousand mile</l>
     <l n="39">Than earth has ever seen her , even in dreams .</l>
     <l n="40">As for the stars , if seeing them were all ,</l>
     <l n="41">Three thousand million new-found points of light</l>
     <l n="42">Is our rough guess . But never speak of this .</l>
     <l n="43">You know our press . They 'd miss the one result</l>
     <l n="44">To flash ‘ three thousand millions ’ round the world . ”</l>
     <l n="45">To-morrow night ! For more than twenty years ,</l>
     <l n="46">They had thought and planned and worked . Ten years had gone ,</l>
     <l n="47">One-fourth , or more , of man 's brief working life ,</l>
     <l n="48">Before they made those solid tons of glass ,</l>
     <l n="49">Their hundred-inch reflector , the clear pool ,</l>
     <l n="50">The polished flawless pool that it must be</l>
     <l n="51">To hold the perfect image of a star .</l>
     <l n="52">And , even now , some secret flaw — none knew</l>
     <l n="53">Until to-morrow 's test — might waste it all .</l>
     <l n="54">Where was the gambler that would stake so much ,—</l>
     <l n="55">Time , patience , treasure , on a single throw ?</l>
     <l n="56">The cost of it ,— they 'd not find that again ,</l>
     <l n="57">Either in gold or life-stuff ! All their youth</l>
     <l n="58">Was fuel to the flame of this one work .</l>
     <l n="59">Once in a lifetime to the man of science ,</l>
     <l n="60">Despite what fools believe his ice-cooled blood ,</l>
     <l n="61">There comes this drama .</l>
     <l n="62">If he fails , he fails</l>
     <l n="63">Utterly . He at least will have no time</l>
     <l n="64">For fresh beginnings . Other men , no doubt ,</l>
     <l n="65">Years hence , will use the footholes that he cut</l>
     <l n="66">In those precipitous cliffs , and reach the height ,</l>
     <l n="67">But he will never see it . ”</l>
     <l n="68">So for me ,</l>
     <l n="69">The light words of that letter seemed to hide</l>
     <l n="70">The passion of a lifetime , and I shared</l>
     <l n="71">The crowning moment of its hope and fear .</l>
     <l n="72">Next day , through whispering aisles of palm we rode</l>
     <l n="73">Up to the foot-hills , dreaming desert-hills</l>
     <l n="74">That to assuage their own delicious drought</l>
     <l n="75">Had set each tawny sun-kissed slope ablaze</l>
     <l n="76">With peach and orange orchards .</l>
     <l n="77">Up and up ,</l>
     <l n="78">Along the thin white trail that wound and climbed</l>
     <l n="79">And zig-zagged through the grey-green mountain sage ,</l>
     <l n="80">The car went crawling , till the shining plain</l>
     <l n="81">Below it , like an airman 's map , unrolled .</l>
     <l n="82">Houses and orchards dwindled to white specks</l>
     <l n="83">In midget cubes and squares of tufted green .</l>
     <l n="84">Once , as we rounded one steep curve , that made</l>
     <l n="85">The head swim at the canyoned gulf below ,</l>
     <l n="86">We saw through thirty miles of lucid air</l>
     <l n="87">Elvishly small , sharp as a crumpled petal</l>
     <l n="88">Blown from the stem , a yard away , a sail</l>
     <l n="89">Lazily drifting on the warm blue sea .</l>
     <l n="90">Up for nine miles along that spiral trail</l>
     <l n="91">Slowly we wound to reach the lucid height</l>
     <l n="92">Above the clouds , where that white dome of shell ,</l>
     <l n="93">No wren 's now , but an eagle 's , took the flush</l>
     <l n="94">Of dying day . The sage-brush all died out ,</l>
     <l n="95">And all the southern growths , and round us now ,</l>
     <l n="96">Firs of the north , and strong , storm-rooted pines</l>
     <l n="97">Exhaled a keener fragrance ; till , at last ,</l>
     <l n="98">Reversing all the laws of lesser hills ,</l>
     <l n="99">They towered like giants round us . Darkness fell</l>
     <l n="100">Before we reached the mountain 's naked height .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="101">Over us , like some great cathedral dome ,</l>
     <l n="102">The observatory loomed against the sky ;</l>
     <l n="103">And the dark mountain with its headlong gulfs</l>
     <l n="104">Had lost all memory of the world below ;</l>
     <l n="105">For all those cloudless throngs of glittering stars</l>
     <l n="106">And all those glimmerings where the abyss of space</l>
     <l n="107">Is powdered with a milky dust , each grain</l>
     <l n="108">A burning sun , and every sun the lord</l>
     <l n="109">Of its own darkling planets ,— all those lights</l>
     <l n="110">Met , in a darker deep , the lights of earth ,</l>
     <l n="111">Lights on the sea , lights of invisible towns ,</l>
     <l n="112">Trembling and indistinguishable from stars ,</l>
     <l n="113">In those black gulfs around the mountain 's feet .</l>
     <l n="114">Then , into the glimmering dome , with bated breath ,</l>
     <l n="115">We entered , and , above us , in the gloom</l>
     <l n="116">Saw that majestic weapon of the light</l>
     <l n="117">Uptowering like the shaft of some huge gun</l>
     <l n="118">Through one arched rift of sky .</l>
     <l n="119">Dark at its base</l>
     <l n="120">With naked arms , the crew that all day long</l>
     <l n="121">Had sweated to make ready for this night</l>
     <l n="122">Waited their captain 's word .</l>
     <l n="123">The switchboard shone</l>
     <l n="124">With elfin lamps of white and red , and keys</l>
     <l n="125">Whence , at a finger 's touch , that monstrous tube</l>
     <l n="126">Moved like a creature dowered with life and will ,</l>
     <l n="127">To peer from deep to deep .</l>
     <l n="128">Below it pulsed</l>
     <l n="129">The clock-machine that slowly , throb by throb ,</l>
     <l n="130">Timed to the pace of the revolving earth ,</l>
     <l n="131">Drove the titanic muzzle on and on ,</l>
     <l n="132">Fixed to the chosen star that else would glide</l>
     <l n="133">Out of its field of vision .</l>
     <l n="134">So , set free</l>
     <l n="135">Balanced against the wheel of time , it swung ,</l>
     <l n="136">Or rested , while , to find new realms of sky</l>
     <l n="137">The dome that housed it , like a moon revolved ,</l>
     <l n="138">So smoothly that the watchers hardly knew</l>
     <l n="139">They moved within ; till , through the glimmering doors ,</l>
     <l n="140">They saw the dark procession of the pines</l>
     <l n="141">Like Indian warriors , quietly stealing by .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="142">Then , at a word , the mighty weapon dipped</l>
     <l n="143">Its muzzle and aimed at one small point of light</l>
     <l n="144">One seeming insignificant star .</l>
     <l n="145">The chief ,</l>
     <l n="146">Mounting the ladder , while we held our breath ,</l>
     <l n="147">Looked through the eye-piece .</l>
     <l n="148">Then we heard him laugh</l>
     <l n="149">His thanks to God , and hide it in a jest .</l>
     <l n="150">“ A prominence on Jupiter ! ” —</l>
     <l n="151">They laughed ,</l>
     <l n="152">“ What do you mean ? ” — “ It 's moving , ” cried the chief ,</l>
     <l n="153">They laughed again , and watched his glimmering face</l>
     <l n="154">High overhead against that moving tower .</l>
     <l n="155">“ Come up and see , then ! ”</l>
     <l n="156">One by one they went ,</l>
     <l n="157">And , though each laughed as he returned to earth ,</l>
     <l n="158">Their souls were in their eyes .</l>
     <l n="159">Then I , too , looked ,</l>
     <l n="160">And saw that insignificant spark of light</l>
     <l n="161">Touched with new meaning , beautifully reborn ,</l>
     <l n="162">A swimming world , a perfect rounded pearl ,</l>
     <l n="163">Poised in the violet sky ; and , as I gazed ,</l>
     <l n="164">I saw a miracle ,— right on its upmost edge</l>
     <l n="165">A tiny mound of white that slowly rose ,</l>
     <l n="166">Then , like an exquisite seed-pearl , swung quite clear</l>
     <l n="167">And swam in heaven above its parent world</l>
     <l n="168">To greet its three bright sister-moons .</l>
     <l n="169">A moon ,</l>
     <l n="170">Of Jupiter , no more , but clearer far</l>
     <l n="171">Than mortal eyes had seen before from earth ,</l>
     <l n="172">O , beautiful and clear beyond all dreams</l>
     <l n="173">Was that one silver phrase of the starry tune</l>
     <l n="174">Which Galileo 's “ old discoverer ” first</l>
     <l n="175">Dimly revealed , dissolving into clouds</l>
     <l n="176">The imagined fabric of our universe .</l>
     <l n="177">“ Jupiter stands in heaven and will stand</l>
     <l n="178">Though all the sycophants bark at him , ” he cried ,</l>
     <l n="179">Hailing the truth before he , too , went down ,</l>
     <l n="180">Whelmed in the cloudy wreckage of that dream .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="181">So one by one we looked , the men who served</l>
     <l n="182">Urania , and the men from Vulcan 's forge .</l>
     <l n="183">A beautiful eagerness in the darkness lit</l>
     <l n="184">The swarthy faces that too long had missed</l>
     <l n="185">A meaning in the dull mechanic maze</l>
     <l n="186">Of labour on this blind earth , but found it now .</l>
     <l n="187">Though only a moment 's wandering melody</l>
     <l n="188">Hopelessly far above , it gave their toil</l>
     <l n="189">Its only consecration and its joy .</l>
     <l n="190">There , with dark-smouldering eyes and naked throats ,</l>
     <l n="191">Blue-dungareed , red-shirted , grimed and smeared</l>
     <l n="192">With engine-grease and sweat , they gathered round</l>
     <l n="193">The foot of that dim ladder ; each muttering low</l>
     <l n="194">As he came down , his wonder at what he saw</l>
     <l n="195">To those who waited ,— a picture for the brush</l>
     <l n="196">Of Rembrandt , lighted only by the rift</l>
     <l n="197">Above them , where the giant muzzle thrust</l>
     <l n="198">Out through the dim arched roof , and slowly throbbed ,</l>
     <l n="199">Against the slowly moving wheel of the earth ,</l>
     <l n="200">Holding their chosen star .</l>
     <l n="201">There , like an elf ,</l>
     <l n="202">Perched on the side of that dark slanting tower</l>
     <l n="203">The Italian mechanician watched the moons ,</l>
     <l n="204">That Italy discovered .</l>
     <l n="205">One by one ,</l>
     <l n="206">American , English , French , and Dutch , they climbed</l>
     <l n="207">To see the wonder that their own blind hands</l>
     <l n="208">Had helped to achieve .</l>
     <l n="209">At midnight while they paused</l>
     <l n="210">To adjust the clock-machine , I wandered out</l>
     <l n="211">Alone , into the silence of the night .</l>
     <l n="212">The silence ? On that lonely height I heard</l>
     <l n="213">Eternal voices ;</l>
     <l n="214">For , as I looked into the gulf beneath ,</l>
     <l n="215">Whence almost all the lights had vanished now ,</l>
     <l n="216">The whole dark mountain seemed to have lost its earth</l>
     <l n="217">And to be sailing like a ship through heaven .</l>
     <l n="218">All round it surged the mighty sea-like sound</l>
     <l n="219">Of soughing pine-woods , one vast ebb and flow</l>
     <l n="220">Of absolute peace , aloof from all earth 's pain ,</l>
     <l n="221">So calm , so quiet , it seemed the cradle-song ,</l>
     <l n="222">The deep soft breathing of the universe</l>
     <l n="223">Over its youngest child , the soul of man .</l>
     <l n="224">And , as I listened , that Aeolian voice</l>
     <l n="225">Became an invocation and a prayer :</l>
     <l n="226">O you , that on your loftier mountain dwell</l>
     <l n="227">And move like light in light among the thoughts</l>
     <l n="228">Of heaven , translating our mortality</l>
     <l n="229">Into immortal song , is there not one</l>
     <l n="230">Among you that can turn to music now</l>
     <l n="231">This long dark fight for truth ? Not one to touch</l>
     <l n="232">With beauty this long battle for the light ,</l>
     <l n="233">This little victory of the spirit of man</l>
     <l n="234">Doomed to defeat — for what was all we saw</l>
     <l n="235">To that which neither eyes nor soul could see ?—</l>
     <l n="236">Doomed to defeat and yet unconquerable ,</l>
     <l n="237">Climbing its nine miles nearer to the stars .</l>
     <l n="238">Wars we have sung . The blind , blood-boltered kings</l>
     <l n="239">Move with an epic music to their thrones .</l>
     <l n="240">Have you no song , then , of that nobler war ?</l>
     <l n="241">Of those who strove for light , but could not dream</l>
     <l n="242">Even of this victory that they helped to win ,</l>
     <l n="243">Silent discoverers , lonely pioneers ,</l>
     <l n="244">Prisoners and exiles , martyrs of the truth</l>
     <l n="245">Who handed on the fire , from age to age ;</l>
     <l n="246">Of those who , step by step , drove back the night</l>
     <l n="247">And struggled , year on year , for one more glimpse</l>
     <l n="248">Among the stars , of sovran law , their guide ;</l>
     <l n="249">Of those who searching inward , saw the rocks</l>
     <l n="250">Dissolving into a new abyss , and saw</l>
     <l n="251">Those planetary systems far within ,</l>
     <l n="252">Atoms , electrons , whirling on their way</l>
     <l n="253">To build and to unbuild our solid world ;</l>
     <l n="254">Of those who conquered , inch by difficult inch ,</l>
     <l n="255">The freedom of this realm of law for man ;</l>
     <l n="256">Dreamers of dreams , the builders of our hope ,</l>
     <l n="257">The healers and the binders up of wounds ,</l>
     <l n="258">Who , while the dynasts drenched the world with blood ,</l>
     <l n="259">Would in the still small circle of a lamp</l>
     <l n="260">Wrestle with death like Heracles of old</l>
     <l n="261">To save one stricken child .</l>
     <l n="262">Is there no song</l>
     <l n="263">To touch this moving universe of law</l>
     <l n="264">With ultimate light , the glimmer of that great dawn</l>
     <l n="265">Which over our ruined altars yet shall break</l>
     <l n="266">In purer splendour , and restore mankind</l>
     <l n="267">From darker dreams than even Lucretius knew</l>
     <l n="268">To vision of that one Power which guides the world .</l>
     <l n="269">How should men find it ? Only through those doors</l>
     <l n="270">Which , opening inward , in each separate soul</l>
     <l n="271">Give each man access to that Soul of all</l>
     <l n="272">Living within each life , not to be found</l>
     <l n="273">Or known , till , looking inward , each alone</l>
     <l n="274">Meets the unknowable and eternal God .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="275">And there was one that moved like light in light</l>
     <l n="276">Before me there ,— Love , human and divine ,</l>
     <l n="277">That can exalt all weakness into power ,—</l>
     <l n="278">Whispering , Take this deathless torch of song ...</l>
     <l n="279">Whispering , but with such faith , that even I</l>
     <l n="280">Was humbled into thinking this might be</l>
     <l n="281">Through love , though all the wisdom of the world</l>
     <l n="282">Account it folly .</l>
     <l n="283">Let my breast be bared</l>
     <l n="284">To every shaft , then , so that Love be still</l>
     <l n="285">My one celestial guide the while I sing</l>
     <l n="286">Of those who caught the pure Promethean fire</l>
     <l n="287">One from another , each crying as he went down</l>
     <l n="288">To one that waited , crowned with youth and joy ,—</l>
     <l n="289">Take thou the splendour , carry it out of sight</l>
     <l n="290">Into the great new age I must not know ,</l>
     <l n="291">Into the great new realm I must not tread .</l>

    <head>COPERNICUS</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">The neighbours gossiped idly at the door .</l>
     <l n="2">Copernicus lay dying overhead .</l>
     <l n="3">His little throng of friends , with startled eyes ,</l>
     <l n="4">Whispered together , in that dark house of dreams ,</l>
     <l n="5">From which by one dim crevice in the wall</l>
     <l n="6">He used to watch the stars .</l>
     <l n="7">“ His book has come</l>
     <l n="8">From Nuremberg at last ; but who would dare</l>
     <l n="9">To let him see it now ? ” —</l>
     <l n="10">“ They have altered it !</l>
     <l n="11">Though Rome approved in full , this preface , look ,</l>
     <l n="12">Declares that his discoveries are a dream ! ” —</l>
     <l n="13">“ He has asked a thousand times if it has come ;</l>
     <l n="14">Could we tear out those pages ? ” —</l>
     <l n="15">“ He 'd suspect . ” —</l>
     <l n="16">“ What shall be done , then ? ” —</l>
     <l n="17">“ Hold it back awhile .</l>
     <l n="18">That was the priest 's voice in the room above .</l>
     <l n="19">He may forget it . Those last sacraments</l>
     <l n="20">May set his mind at rest , and bring him peace . ” —</l>
     <l n="21">Then , stealing quietly to that upper door ,</l>
     <l n="22">They opened it a little , and saw within</l>
     <l n="23">The lean white deathbed of Copernicus</l>
     <l n="24">Who made our world a world without an end .</l>
     <l n="25">There , in that narrow room , they saw his face</l>
     <l n="26">Grey , seamed with thought , lit by a single lamp ;</l>
     <l n="27">They saw those glorious eyes</l>
     <l n="28">Closing , that once had looked beyond the spheres</l>
     <l n="29">And seen our ancient firmaments dissolve</l>
     <l n="30">Into a boundless night .</l>
     <l n="31">Beside him knelt</l>
     <l n="32">Two women , like bowed shadows . At his feet ,</l>
     <l n="33">An old physician watched him . At his head ,</l>
     <l n="34">The cowled Franciscan murmured , while the light</l>
     <l n="35">Shone faintly on the chalice .</l>
     <l n="36">All grew still .</l>
     <l n="37">The fragrance of the wine was like faint flowers ,</l>
     <l n="38">The first breath of those far celestial fields ....</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="39">Then , like a dying soldier , that must leave</l>
     <l n="40">His last command to others , while the fight</l>
     <l n="41">Is yet uncertain , and the victory far ,</l>
     <l n="42">Copernicus whispered , in a fevered dream ,</l>
     <l n="43">“ Yes , it is Death . But you must hold him back ,</l>
     <l n="44">There , in the doorway , for a little while ,</l>
     <l n="45">Until I know the work is rightly done .</l>
     <l n="46">Use all your weapons , doctor . I must live</l>
     <l n="47">To see and touch one copy of my book .</l>
     <l n="48">Have they not brought it yet ?</l>
     <l n="49">They promised me</l>
     <l n="50">It should be here by nightfall .</l>
     <l n="51">One of you go</l>
     <l n="52">And hasten it . I can hold back</l>
     <l n="53">Death till dawn .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="54">Have they not brought it yet ?— from Nuremberg .</l>
     <l n="55">Do not deceive me . I must know it safe ,</l>
     <l n="56">Printed and safe , for other men to use .</l>
     <l n="57">I could die then . My use would be fulfilled .</l>
     <l n="58">What has delayed them ? Will not some one go</l>
     <l n="59">And tell them that my strength is running out ?</l>
     <l n="60">Tell them that book would be an angel 's hand</l>
     <l n="61">In mine , an easier pillow for my head ,</l>
     <l n="62">A little lantern in the engulfing dark .</l>
     <l n="63">You see , I hid its struggling light so long</l>
     <l n="64">Under too small a bushel , and I fear</l>
     <l n="65">It may go out forever . In the noon</l>
     <l n="66">Of life 's brief day , I could not see the need</l>
     <l n="67">As now I see it , when the night shuts down .</l>
     <l n="68">I was afraid , perhaps , it might confuse</l>
     <l n="69">The lights that guide us for the souls of men .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="70">But now I see three stages in our life .</l>
     <l n="71">At first , we bask contented in our sun</l>
     <l n="72">And take what daylight shows us for the truth .</l>
     <l n="73">Then we discover , in some midnight grief ,</l>
     <l n="74">How all day long the sunlight blinded us</l>
     <l n="75">To depths beyond , where all our knowledge dies .</l>
     <l n="76">That 's where men shrink , and lose their way in doubt .</l>
     <l n="77">Then , last , as death draws nearer , comes a night</l>
     <l n="78">In whose majestic shadow men see God ,</l>
     <l n="79">Absolute Knowledge , reconciling all .</l>
     <l n="80">So , all my life I pondered on that scheme</l>
     <l n="81">Which makes this earth the centre of all worlds ,</l>
     <l n="82">Lighted and wheeled around by sun and moon</l>
     <l n="83">And that great crystal sphere wherein men thought</l>
     <l n="84">Myriads of lesser stars were fixed like lamps ,</l>
     <l n="85">Each in its place ,— one mighty glittering wheel</l>
     <l n="86">Revolving round this dark abode of man .</l>
     <l n="87">Night after night , with even pace they moved .</l>
     <l n="88">Year after year , not altering by one point ,</l>
     <l n="89">Their order , or their stations , those fixed stars</l>
     <l n="90">In that revolving firmament . The Plough</l>
     <l n="91">Still pointed to the Pole . Fixed in their sphere ,</l>
     <l n="92">How else explain that vast unchanging wheel ?</l>
     <l n="93">How , but by thinking all those lesser lights</l>
     <l n="94">Were huger suns , divided from our earth</l>
     <l n="95">By so immense a gulf that , if they moved</l>
     <l n="96">Ten thousand leagues an hour among themselves ,</l>
     <l n="97">It would not seem one hair'shYpppHeNbreadth to our eyes .</l>
     <l n="98">Utterly inconceivable , I know ;</l>
     <l n="99">And yet we daily kneel to boundless Power</l>
     <l n="100">And build our hope on that Infinitude .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="101">This did not daunt me , then . Indeed , I saw</l>
     <l n="102">Light upon chaos . Many discordant dreams</l>
     <l n="103">Began to move in lucid music now .</l>
     <l n="104">For what could be more baffling than the thought</l>
     <l n="105">That those enormous heavens must circle earth</l>
     <l n="106">Diurnally — a journey that would need</l>
     <l n="107">Swiftness to which the lightning flash would seem</l>
     <l n="108">A white slug creeping on the walls of night ;</l>
     <l n="109">While , if earth softly on her axle spun</l>
     <l n="110">One quiet revolution answered all .</l>
     <l n="111">It was our moving selves that made the sky</l>
     <l n="112">Seem to revolve . Have not all ages seen</l>
     <l n="113">A like illusion baffling half mankind</l>
     <l n="114">In life , thought , art ? Men think , at every turn</l>
     <l n="115">Of their own souls , the very heavens have moved .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="116">Light upon chaos , light , and yet more light ;</l>
     <l n="117">For — as I watched the planets — Venus , Mars ,</l>
     <l n="118">Appeared to wax and wane from month to month</l>
     <l n="119">As though they moved , now near , now far , from earth .</l>
     <l n="120">Earth could not be their centre . Was the sun</l>
     <l n="121">Their sovran lord then , as Pythagoras held ?</l>
     <l n="122">Was this great earth , so ‘ stablished , so secure ,</l>
     <l n="123">A planet also ? Did it also move</l>
     <l n="124">Around the sun ? If this were true , my friends ,</l>
     <l n="125">No revolution in this world 's affairs ,</l>
     <l n="126">Not that blind maelstrom where imperial Rome</l>
     <l n="127">Went down into the dark , could so engulf</l>
     <l n="128">All that we thought we knew . We who believed</l>
     <l n="129">In our own majesty , we who walked with gods</l>
     <l n="130">As younger sons on this proud central stage ,</l>
     <l n="131">Round which the whole bright firmament revolved</l>
     <l n="132">For our especial glory , must we creep</l>
     <l n="133">Like ants upon our midget ball of dust</l>
     <l n="134">Lost in immensity ?</l>
     <l n="135">I could not take</l>
     <l n="136">That darkness lightly . I withheld my book</l>
     <l n="137">For many a year , until I clearly saw ,</l>
     <l n="138">And Rome approved me — have they not brought it yet ?—</l>
     <l n="139">That this tremendous music could not drown</l>
     <l n="140">The still supernal music of the soul ,</l>
     <l n="141">Or quench the light that shone when Christ was born .</l>
     <l n="142">For who , if one lost star could lead the kings</l>
     <l n="143">To God 's own Son , would shrink from following these</l>
     <l n="144">To His eternal throne ?</l>
     <l n="145">This at the least</l>
     <l n="146">We know , the soul of man can soar through heaven .</l>
     <l n="147">It is our own wild wings that dwarf the world</l>
     <l n="148">To nothingness beneath us . Let the soul</l>
     <l n="149">Take courage , then . If its own thought be true ,</l>
     <l n="150">Not all the immensities of little minds</l>
     <l n="151">Can ever quench its own celestial fire .</l>
     <l n="152">No . This new night was needed , that the soul</l>
     <l n="153">Might conquer its own kingdom and arise</l>
     <l n="154">To its full stature . So , in face of death ,</l>
     <l n="155">I saw that I must speak the truth I knew .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="156">Have they not brought it ? What delays my book ?</l>
     <l n="157">I am afraid . Tell me the truth , my friends .</l>
     <l n="158">At this last hour , the Church may yet withhold</l>
     <l n="159">Her sanction . Not the Church , but those who think</l>
     <l n="160">A little darkness helps her .</l>
     <l n="161">Were this true ,</l>
     <l n="162">They would do well . If the poor light we win</l>
     <l n="163">Confuse or blind us , to the Light of lights ,</l>
     <l n="164">Let all our wisdom perish . I affirm</l>
     <l n="165">A greater Darkness , where the one true Church</l>
     <l n="166">Shall after all her agonies of loss</l>
     <l n="167">And many an age of doubt , perhaps , to come ,</l>
     <l n="168">See this processional host of splendours burn</l>
     <l n="169">Like tapers round her altar .</l>
     <l n="170">So I speak</l>
     <l n="171">Not for myself , but for the age unborn .</l>
     <l n="172">I caught the fire from those who went before ,</l>
     <l n="173">The bearers of the torch who could not see</l>
     <l n="174">The goal to which they strained . I caught their fire ,</l>
     <l n="175">And carried it , only a little way beyond ;</l>
     <l n="176">But there are those that wait for it , I know ,</l>
     <l n="177">Those who will carry it on to victory .</l>
     <l n="178">I dare not fail them . Looking back , I see</l>
     <l n="179">Those others ,— fallen , with their arms outstretched</l>
     <l n="180">Dead , pointing to the future .</l>
     <l n="181">Far , far back ,</l>
     <l n="182">Before the Egyptians built their pyramids</l>
     <l n="183">With those dark funnels pointing to the north ,</l>
     <l n="184">Through which the Pharaohs from their desert tombs</l>
     <l n="185">Gaze all night long upon the Polar Star ,</l>
     <l n="186">Some wandering Arab crept from death to life</l>

     <l n="188">Long , long ago — have they not brought it yet ?</l>

     <l n="192">A prelude , hinting at that deeper night</l>

      <l n="1">They thought him a magician , Tycho Brahe ,</l>
      <l n="2">Who lived on that strange island in the Sound ,</l>
      <l n="3">Nine miles from Elsinore .</l>
      <l n="4">His legend reached</l>
      <l n="5">The Mermaid Inn the year that Shakespeare died .</l>
      <l n="6">Fynes Moryson had brought his travellers ’ tales</l>
      <l n="7">Of Wheen , the heart-shaped isle where Tycho made</l>
      <l n="8">His great discoveries , and , with Jeppe , his dwarf ,</l>
      <l n="9">And flaxen-haired Christine , the peasant girl ,</l>
      <l n="10">Dreamed his great dreams for five-and-twenty years .</l>
      <l n="11">For there he lit that lanthorn of the law ,</l>
      <l n="12">Uraniborg ; that fortress of the truth ,</l>
      <l n="13">With Pegasus flying above its loftiest tower ,</l>
      <l n="14">While , in its roofs , like wide enchanted eyes</l>
      <l n="15">Watching , the brightest windows in the world ,</l>
      <l n="16">Opened upon the stars .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="2">
      <l n="17">Nine miles from Elsinore , with all those ghosts ,</l>
      <l n="18">There 's magic enough in that ! But white-cliffed Wheen ,</l>
      <l n="19">Six miles in girth , with crowds of hunchback waves</l>
      <l n="20">Crawling all round it , and those moonstruck windows ,</l>
      <l n="21">Held its own magic , too ; for Tycho Brahe</l>
      <l n="22">By his mysterious alchemy of dreams</l>
      <l n="23">Had so enriched the soil , that when the king</l>
      <l n="24">Of England wished to buy it , Denmark asked</l>
      <l n="25">A price too great for any king on earth .</l>
      <l n="26">“ Give us , ” they said , “ in scarlet cardinal 's cloth</l>
      <l n="27">Enough to cover it , and , at every corner ,</l>
      <l n="28">Of every piece , a right rose-noble too ;</l>
      <l n="29">Then all that kings can buy of Wheen is yours .</l>
      <l n="30">Only , ” said they , “ a merchant bought it once ;</l>
      <l n="31">And , when he came to claim it , goblins flocked</l>
      <l n="32">All round him , from its forty goblin farms ,</l>
      <l n="33">And mocked him , bidding him take away the stones</l>
      <l n="34">That he had bought , for nothing else was his . ”</l>
      <l n="35">These things were fables . They were also true .</l>
      <l n="36">They thought him a magician , Tycho Brahe ,</l>
      <l n="37">The astrologer , who wore the mask of gold .</l>
      <l n="38">Perhaps he was . There 's magic in the truth ;</l>
      <l n="39">And only those who find and follow its laws</l>
      <l n="40">Can work its miracles .</l>
      <l n="41">Tycho sought the truth</l>
      <l n="42">From that strange year in boyhood when he heard</l>
      <l n="43">The great eclipse foretold ; and , on the day</l>
      <l n="44">Appointed , at the very minute even ,</l>
      <l n="45">Beheld the weirdly punctual shadow creep</l>
      <l n="46">Across the sun , bewildering all the birds</l>
      <l n="47">With thoughts of evening .</l>
      <l n="48">Picture him , on that day ,</l>
      <l n="49">The boy at Copenhagen , with his mane</l>
      <l n="50">Of thick red hair , thrusting his freckled face</l>
      <l n="51">Out of his upper window , holding the piece</l>
      <l n="52">Of glass he blackened above his candle-flame</l>
      <l n="53">To watch that orange ember in the sky</l>
      <l n="54">Wane into smouldering ash .</l>
      <l n="55">He whispered there ,</l>
      <l n="56">“ So it is true . By searching in the heavens ,</l>
      <l n="57">Men can foretell the future . ”</l>
      <l n="58">In the street</l>
      <l n="59">Below him , throngs were babbling of the plague</l>
      <l n="60">That might or might not follow .</l>
      <l n="61">He resolved</l>
      <l n="62">To make himself the master of that deep art</l>
      <l n="63">And know what might be known .</l>
      <l n="64">He bought the books</l>
      <l n="65">Of Stadius , with his tables of the stars .</l>
      <l n="66">Night after night , among the gabled roofs ,</l>
      <l n="67">Climbing and creeping through a world unknown</l>
      <l n="68">Save to the roosting stork , he learned to find</l>
      <l n="69">The constellations , Cassiopeia 's throne ,</l>
      <l n="70">The Plough still pointing to the Polar Star ,</l>
      <l n="71">The sword-belt of Orion . There he watched</l>
      <l n="72">The movements of the planets , hours on hours ,</l>
      <l n="73">And wondered at the mystery of it all .</l>
      <l n="74">All this he did in secret , for his birth</l>
      <l n="75">Was noble , and such wonderings were a sign</l>
      <l n="76">Of low estate , when Tycho Brahe was young ;</l>
      <l n="77">And all his kinsmen hoped that Tycho Brahe</l>
      <l n="78">Would live , serene as they , among his dogs</l>
      <l n="79">And horses ; or , if honour must be won ,</l>
      <l n="80">Let the superfluous glory flow from fields</l>
      <l n="81">Where blood might still be shed ; or from those courts</l>
      <l n="82">Where statesmen lie . But Tycho sought the truth .</l>
      <l n="83">So , when they sent him in his tutor 's charge</l>
      <l n="84">To Leipzig , for such studies as they held</l>
      <l n="85">More worthy of his princely blood , he searched</l>
      <l n="86">The Almagest ; and , while his tutor slept ,</l>
      <l n="87">Measured the delicate angles of the stars ,</l>
      <l n="88">Out of his window , with his compasses ,</l>
      <l n="89">His only instrument . Even with this rude aid</l>
      <l n="90">He found so many an ancient record wrong</l>
      <l n="91">That more and more he burned to find the truth .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="3">
      <l n="92">One night at home , as Tycho searched the sky ,</l>
      <l n="93">Out of his window , compasses in hand ,</l>
      <l n="94">Fixing one point upon a planet , one</l>
      <l n="95">Upon some loftier star , a ripple of laughter</l>
      <l n="96">Startled him , from the garden walk below .</l>
      <l n="97">He lowered his compass , peered into the dark</l>
      <l n="98">And saw — Christine , the blue-eyed peasant girl ,</l>
      <l n="99">With bare brown feet , standing among the flowers .</l>
      <l n="100">She held what seemed an apple in her hand ;</l>
      <l n="101">And , in a voice that Aprilled all his blood ,</l>
      <l n="102">The low soft voice of earth , drawing him down</l>
      <l n="103">From those cold heights to that warm breast of Spring ,</l>
      <l n="104">A natural voice that had not learned to use</l>
      <l n="105">The false tones of the world , simple and clear</l>
      <l n="106">As a bird 's voice , out of the fragrant darkness called ,</l>
      <l n="107">“ I saw it falling from your window-ledge !</l>
      <l n="108">I thought it was an apple , till it rolled</l>
      <l n="109">Over my foot .</l>
      <l n="110">It 's heavy . Shall I try</l>
      <l n="111">To throw it back to you ? ”</l>
      <l n="112">Tycho saw a stain</l>
      <l n="113">Of purple across one small arched glistening foot .</l>
      <l n="114">“ Your foot Is bruised , ” he cried .</l>
      <l n="115">“ O no , ” she laughed ,</l>
      <l n="116">And plucked the stain off . “ Only a petal , see . ”</l>
      <l n="117">She showed it to him .</l>
      <l n="118">“ But this — I wonder now</l>
      <l n="119">If I can throw it . ”</l>
      <l n="120">Twice she tried and failed ;</l>
      <l n="121">Or Tycho failed to catch that slippery sphere .</l>
      <l n="122">He saw the supple body swaying below ,</l>
      <l n="123">The ripe red lips that parted as she laughed ,</l>
      <l n="124">And those deep eyes where all the stars were drowned .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="4">
      <l n="125">At the third time he caught it ; and she vanished ,</l>
      <l n="126">Waving her hand , a little floating moth ,</l>
      <l n="127">Between the pine-trees , into the warm dark night .</l>
      <l n="128">He turned into his room , and quickly thrust</l>
      <l n="129">Under his pillow that forbidden fruit ;</l>
      <l n="130">For the door opened , and the hot red face</l>
      <l n="131">Of Otto Brahe , his father , glowered at him .</l>
      <l n="132">“ What 's this ? What 's this ? ”</l>
      <l n="133">The furious-eyed old man</l>
      <l n="134">Limped to the bedside , pulled the mystery out ,</l>
      <l n="135">And stared upon the strangest apple of Eve</l>
      <l n="136">That ever troubled Eden ,— heavy as bronze ,</l>
      <l n="137">And delicately enchased with silver stars ,</l>
      <l n="138">The small celestial globe that Tycho bought</l>
      <l n="139">In Leipzig .</l>
      <l n="140">Then the storm burst on his head !</l>
      <l n="141">This moon-struck ‘ pothecary'shYpppHeNprentice work ,</l>
      <l n="142">These cheap-jack calendar-maker 's gypsy tricks</l>
      <l n="143">Would damn the mother of any Knutsdorp squire ,</l>
      <l n="144">And crown his father like a stag of ten .</l>
      <l n="145">Quarrel on quarrel followed from that night ,</l>
      <l n="146">Till Tycho sickened of his ancient name ;</l>
      <l n="147">And , wandering through the woods about his home ,</l>
      <l n="148">Found on a hill-top , ringed with fragrant pines ,</l>
      <l n="149">A little open glade of whispering ferns .</l>
      <l n="150">Thither , at night , he stole to watch the stars ;</l>
      <l n="151">And there he told the oldest tale on earth</l>
      <l n="152">To one that watched beside him , one whose eyes</l>
      <l n="153">Shone with true love , more beautiful than the stars ,</l>
      <l n="154">A daughter of earth , the peasant-girl , Christine .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="5">
      <l n="155">They met there , in the dusk , on his last night</l>
      <l n="156">At home , before he went to Wittenberg .</l>
      <l n="157">They stood knee-deep among the whispering ferns ,</l>
      <l n="158">And said good-bye .</l>
      <l n="159">“ I shall return , ” he said ,</l>
      <l n="160">“ And shame them for their folly , who would set</l>
      <l n="161">Their pride above the stars , Christine , and you .</l>
      <l n="162">At Wittenberg or Rostoch I shall find</l>
      <l n="163">More chances and more knowledge . All those worlds</l>
      <l n="164">Are still to conquer . We know nothing yet ;</l>
      <l n="165">The books are crammed with fables . They foretell</l>
      <l n="166">Here an eclipse , and there a dawning moon ,</l>
      <l n="167">But most of them were out a month or more</l>
      <l n="168">On Jupiter and Saturn .</l>
      <l n="169">There 's one way ,</l>
      <l n="170">And only one , to knowledge of the law</l>
      <l n="171">Whereby the stars are steered , and so to read</l>
      <l n="172">The future , even perhaps the destinies</l>
      <l n="173">Of men and nations ,— only one sure way ,</l>
      <l n="174">And that 's to watch them , watch them , and record</l>
      <l n="175">The truth we know , and not the lies we dream .</l>
      <l n="176">Dear , while I watch them , though the hills and sea</l>
      <l n="177">Divide us , every night our eyes can meet</l>
      <l n="178">Among those constant glories . Every night</l>
      <l n="179">Your eyes and mine , upraised to that bright realm ,</l>
      <l n="180">Can , in one moment , speak across the world .</l>
      <l n="181">I shall come back with knowledge and with power ,</l>
      <l n="182">And you — will wait for me ? ”</l>
      <l n="183">She answered him</l>
      <l n="184">In silence , with the starlight of her eyes .</l>

      <l n="185">He watched the skies at Wittenberg . The plague</l>
      <l n="186">Drove him to Rostoch , and he watched them there ;</l>
      <l n="187">But , even there , the plague of little minds</l>
      <l n="188">Beset him . At a wedding-feast he met</l>
      <l n="189">His noble countryman , Manderup , who asked ,</l>

      <l n="192">At country fairs . The guests , and Tycho , laughed ;</l>

      <l n="198">And not a spark of light but those that leapt</l>
      <l n="199">Blue from the clashing blades . Tycho had lost</l>
      <l n="200">His moon and stars awhile , almost his life ;</l>
      <l n="201">For , in one furious bout , his enemy 's blade</l>
      <l n="202">Dashed like a scribble of lightning into the face</l>
      <l n="203">Of Tycho Brahe , and left him spluttering blood ,</l>
      <l n="204">Groping through that dark wood with outstretched hands ,</l>
      <l n="205">To fall in a death-black swoon .</l>
      <l n="206">They carried him back</l>
      <l n="207">To Rostoch ; and when Tycho saw at last</l>
      <l n="208">That mirrored patch of mutilated flesh ,</l>
      <l n="209">Seared as by fire , between the frank blue eyes</l>
      <l n="210">And firm young mouth where , like a living flower</l>
      <l n="211">Upon some stricken tree , youth lingered still ,</l>
      <l n="212">He 'd but one thought , Christine would shrink from him</l>
      <l n="213">In fear , or worse , in pity . An end had come</l>
      <l n="214">Worse than old age , to all the glory of youth .</l>
      <l n="215">Urania would not let her lover stray</l>

      <l n="265">Of old Scultetus , but a kingly weapon ,</l>
      <l n="266">Huge as a Roman battering-ram , and fine</l>

      <l n="314">One frosty night , as Tycho bent his way</l>
      <l n="315">Home to the dark old abbey , he upraised</l>
      <l n="316">His eyes , and saw a portent in the sky .</l>
      <l n="317">There , in its most familiar patch of blue ,</l>
      <l n="318">Where Cassiopeia 's five-fold glory burned ,</l>
      <l n="319">An unknown brilliance quivered , a huge star</l>
      <l n="320">Unseen before , a strange new visitant</l>
      <l n="321">To heavens unchangeable , as the world believed ,</l>
      <l n="322">Since the creation .</l>
      <l n="323">Could new stars be born ?</l>
      <l n="324">Night after night he watched that miracle</l>
      <l n="325">Growing and changing colour as it grew ;</l>
      <l n="326">White at the first , and large as Jupiter ;</l>
      <l n="327">And , in the third month , yellow , and larger yet ;</l>
      <l n="328">Red in the fifth month , like Aldebaran ,</l>
      <l n="329">And larger even than Lyra . In the seventh ,</l>
      <l n="330">Bluish like Saturn ; whence it dulled and dwined</l>
      <l n="331">Little by little , till after eight months more</l>
      <l n="332">Into the dark abysmal blue of night ,</l>
      <l n="333">Whence it arose , the wonder died away .</l>
      <l n="334">But , while it blazed above him , Tycho brought</l>
      <l n="335">Those delicate records of two hundred nights</l>
      <l n="336">To Copenhagen . There , in his golden mask ,</l>
      <l n="337">At supper with Pratensis , who believed</l>
      <l n="338">Only what old books told him , Tycho met</l>
      <l n="339">Dancey , the French Ambassador , rainbow-gay</l>
      <l n="340">In satin hose and doublet , supple and thin ,</l>
      <l n="341">Brown-eyed , and bearded with a soft black tuft</l>
      <l n="342">Neat as a blackbird 's wing ,— a spirit as keen</l>
      <l n="343">And swift as France on all the starry trails</l>
      <l n="344">Of thought .</l>
      <l n="345">He saw the deep and simple fire ,</l>
      <l n="346">The mystery of all genius in those eyes</l>
      <l n="347">Above that golden wizard .</l>
      <l n="348">Tycho raised</l>
      <l n="349">His wine-cup , brimming — they thought — with purple dreams ;</l>
      <l n="350">And bade them drink to their triumphant Queen</l>
      <l n="351">Of all the Muses , to their Lady of Light</l>
      <l n="352">Urania , and the great new star .</l>
      <l n="353">They laughed ,</l>
      <l n="354">Thinking the young astrologer 's golden mask</l>
      <l n="355">Hid a sardonic jest .</l>
      <l n="356">“ The skies are clear , ”</l>
      <l n="357">Said Tycho Brahe , “ and we have eyes to see .</l>
      <l n="358">Put out your candles . Open those windows there ! ”</l>
      <l n="359">The colder darkness breathed upon their brows ,</l>
      <l n="360">And Tycho pointed , into the deep blue night .</l>
      <l n="361">There , in their most immutable height of heaven ,</l>
      <l n="362">In ipso caelo , in the ethereal realm ,</l>
      <l n="363">Beyond all planets , red as Mars it burned ,</l>
      <l n="364">The one impossible glory .</l>
      <l n="365">“ But it 's true ! ”</l>
      <l n="366">Pratensis gasped ; then , clutching the first straw ,</l>
      <l n="367">“ Now I recall how Pliny the Elder said ,</l>
      <l n="368">Hipparchus also saw a strange new star ,</l>
      <l n="369">Not where the comets , not where the Rosae bloom</l>
      <l n="370">And fade , but in that solid crystal sphere</l>
      <l n="371">Where nothing changes . ”</l>
      <l n="372">Tycho smiled , and showed</l>
      <l n="373">The record of his watchings .</l>
      <l n="374">“ But the world</l>
      <l n="375">Must know all this , ” cried Dancey . “ You must print it . ”</l>
      <l n="376">“ Print it ? ” said Tycho , turning that golden mask</l>
      <l n="377">On both his friends . “ Could I , a noble , print</l>
      <l n="378">This trafficking with Urania in a book ?</l>
      <l n="379">They 'd hound me out of Denmark ! This disgrace</l>

      <l n="381">No matter how , in one who ought to dwell</l>
      <l n="382">Fixed to the solid upper sphere , my friends ,</l>
      <l n="383">Would never be forgiven . ”</l>
      <l n="384">Dancey stared</l>
      <l n="385">In mute amazement , but that mask of gold</l>
      <l n="386">Outstared him , sphinx-like , and inscrutable .</l>

     <lg type="stanza" n="14">
      <l n="387">Soon through all Europe , like the blinded moths ,</l>

      <l n="389">Among the mouldering tapestries of thought ,</l>
      <l n="390">Weird fables woke and fluttered to and fro ,</l>
      <l n="391">And wild-eyed sages hunted them for truth .</l>
      <l n="392">The Italian , Frangipani , thought the star</l>
      <l n="393">The lost Electra , that had left her throne</l>
      <l n="394">Among the Pleiads , and plunged into the night</l>
      <l n="395">Like a veiled mourner , when Troy town was burned .</l>
      <l n="396">The German painter , Busch , of Erfurt , wrote ,</l>
      <l n="397">“ It was a comet , made of mortal sins ;</l>
      <l n="398">A poisonous mist , touched by the wrath of God</l>
      <l n="399">To fire ; from which there would descend on earth</l>
      <l n="400">All manner of evil — plagues and sudden death ,</l>
      <l n="401">Frenchmen and famine . ”</l>
      <l n="402">Preachers thumped and raved .</l>
      <l n="403">Theodore Beza in Calvin 's pulpit tore</l>
      <l n="404">His grim black gown , and vowed it was the Star</l>
      <l n="405">That led the Magi . It had now returned</l>
      <l n="406">To mark the world 's end and the Judgment Day .</l>
      <l n="407">Then , in this hubbub , Dancey told the king</l>
      <l n="408">Of Denmark , “ There is one who knows the truth —</l>
      <l n="409">Your subject Tycho Brahe , who , night by night ,</l>
      <l n="410">Watched and recorded all that truth could see .</l>
      <l n="411">It would bring honour to all Denmark , sire ,</l>
      <l n="412">If Tycho could forget his rank awhile ,</l>
      <l n="413">And print these great discoveries in a book ,</l>
      <l n="414">For all the world to read . ”</l>
      <l n="415">So Tycho Brahe</l>
      <l n="416">Received a letter in the king 's own hand ,</l>
      <l n="417">Urging him , “ Truth is the one pure fountain-head</l>
      <l n="418">Of all nobility . Pray forget your rank . ”</l>
      <l n="419">His noble kinsmen echoed , “ If you wish</l>
      <l n="420">To please His Majesty and ourselves , forget</l>
      <l n="421">Your rank . ”</l>
      <l n="422">“ I will , ” said Tycho Brahe ;</l>
      <l n="423">“ Your reasoning has convinced me . I will print</l>
      <l n="424">My book , ‘ De Nova Stella . ’ And to prove</l>
      <l n="425">All you have said concerning temporal rank</l>
      <l n="426">And this eternal truth you love so well ,</l>
      <l n="427">I marry , to-day , ” — they foamed , but all their mouths</l>
      <l n="428">Were stopped and stuffed and sealed with their own words ,—</l>
      <l n="429">“ I marry to-day my own true love , Christine . ”</l>

      <l n="430">They thought him a magician , Tycho Brahe .</l>
      <l n="431">Perhaps he was . There 's magic all around us</l>
      <l n="432">In rocks and trees , and in the minds of men ,</l>

      <l n="439">The secrets of this new astrology ,</l>
      <l n="440">He said , “ This man , in after years , will bring</l>

      <l n="446">So Tycho set this island where he lived</l>
      <l n="447">Whispering with wizardry ; and , in its heart ,</l>
      <l n="448">He lighted that strange lanthorn of the law ,</l>

      <l n="450">Uraniborg , a fortress for the truth ,</l>
      <l n="451">A city of the heavens .</l>
      <l n="452">Around it ran</l>
      <l n="453">A mighty rampart twenty-two feet high ,</l>

      <l n="455">Its angles pointed north , south , east and west ,</l>
      <l n="456">With gates and turrets ; and , within this wall ,</l>
      <l n="457">Were fruitful orchards , apple , and cherry , and pear ;</l>
      <l n="458">And , sheltered in their midst from all but sun ,</l>
      <l n="459">A garden , warm and busy with singing bees .</l>
      <l n="460">There , many an hour , his flaxen-haired Christine ,</l>
      <l n="461">Sang to her child , her first-born , Magdalen ,</l>
      <l n="462">Or watched her playing , a flower among the flowers .</l>
      <l n="463">Dark in the centre of that zone of bliss</l>
      <l n="464">Arose the magic towers of Tycho Brahe .</l>
      <l n="465">Two of them had great windows in their roofs</l>
      <l n="466">Opening upon the sky where'er he willed ,</l>
      <l n="467">And under these observatories he made</l>
      <l n="468">A library of many a golden book ;</l>
      <l n="469">Poets and sages of old Greece and Rome ,</l>
      <l n="470">And many a mellow legend , many a dream</l>
      <l n="471">Of dawning truth in Egypt , or the dusk</l>
      <l n="472">Of Araby . Under all of these he made</l>
      <l n="473">A subterranean crypt for alchemy ,</l>
      <l n="474">With sixteen furnaces ; and , under this ,</l>
      <l n="475">He sank a well , so deep , that Jeppe declared</l>
      <l n="476">He had tapped the central fountains of the world ,</l>
      <l n="477">And drew his magic from those cold clear springs .</l>
      <l n="478">This was the very well , said Jeppe , the dwarf ,</l>
      <l n="479">Where Truth was hidden ; but , by Tycho Brahe</l>
      <l n="480">And his weird skill , the magic water flowed ,</l>
      <l n="481">Through pipes , uphill , to all the house above :</l>
      <l n="482">The kitchen where his cooks could broil a trout</l>
      <l n="483">For sages or prepare a feast for kings ;</l>

      <l n="490">Then , facing to the west , one long green room ,</l>
      <l n="491">The ceiling painted like the bower of Eve</l>

      <l n="495">Like petals from their orchard .</l>
      <l n="496">To the north ,</l>
      <l n="497">He built a printing house for noble books ,</l>

      <l n="534">He watched the skies , recording star on star ,</l>
      <l n="535">For future ages , and , by patient toil ,</l>
      <l n="536">Perfected his great tables of the sun ,</l>
      <l n="537">The moon , the planets .</l>
      <l n="538">There , too happy far</l>
      <l n="539">For any history , sons and daughters rose ,</l>
      <l n="540">A little clan of love , around Christine ;</l>
      <l n="541">And Tycho thought , when I am dead , my sons</l>
      <l n="542">Will rule and work in my Uraniborg .</l>
      <l n="543">And yet a doubt would trouble him , for he knew</l>
      <l n="544">The children of Christine would still be held</l>
      <l n="545">Ignoble , by the world .</l>
      <l n="546">Disciples came ,</l>
      <l n="547">Young-eyed and swift , the bearers of the torch</l>
      <l n="548">From many a city to Uraniborg ,</l>
      <l n="549">And Tycho Brahe received them like a king ,</l>
      <l n="550">And bade them light their torches at his fire .</l>
      <l n="551">The King of Scotland came , with all his court ,</l>
      <l n="552">And dwelt eight days in Tycho Brahe 's domain ,</l>
      <l n="553">Asking him many a riddle , deep and dark ,</l>
      <l n="554">Whose answer , none the less , a king should know .</l>
      <l n="555">What boots it on this earth to be a king ,</l>
      <l n="556">To rule a part of earth , and not to know</l>
      <l n="557">The worth of his own realm , whether he rule</l>
      <l n="558">As God 's vice-gerent , and his realm be still</l>
      <l n="559">The centre of the centre of all worlds ;</l>
      <l n="560">Or whether , as Copernicus proclaimed ,</l>
      <l n="561">This earth itself be moving , a lost grain</l>
      <l n="562">Of dust among the innumerable stars ?</l>
      <l n="563">For this would dwarf all glory but the soul ,</l>
      <l n="564">In king or peasant , that can hail the truth ,</l>
      <l n="565">Though truth should slay it .</l>
      <l n="566">So to Tycho Brahe ,</l>
      <l n="567">The king became a subject for eight days .</l>
      <l n="568">But , in the crowded hall , when he had gone ,</l>
      <l n="569">Jeppe raised his matted head , with a chuckle of glee ,</l>
      <l n="570">Quiet as the gurgle of joy in a dark rock-pool ,</l>
      <l n="571">When the first ripple and wash of the first spring-tide</l>
      <l n="572">Flows bubbling under the dry sun-blackened fringe</l>
      <l n="573">Of seaweed , setting it all afloat again ,</l>
      <l n="574">In magical colours , like a merman 's hair .</l>
      <l n="575">“ Jeppe has a thought , ” the gay young students cried ,</l>
      <l n="576">Thronging him round , for all believed that Jeppe</l>
      <l n="577">Was fey , and had strange visions of the truth .</l>
      <l n="578">“ What is the thought , Jeppe ? ”</l>
      <l n="579">“ I can think no thoughts , ”</l>
      <l n="580">Croaked Jeppe . “ But I have made myself a song . ”</l>
      <l n="581">“ Silence , ” they cried , “ for Jeppe the nightingale !</l>
      <l n="582">Sing , Jeppe ! ”</l>
      <l n="583">And , wagging his great head to and fro</l>
      <l n="584">Before the fire , with deep dark eyes , he crooned :</l>

    <head>THE SONG OF JEPPE</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ What ! ” said the king ,</l>
     <l n="2">“ Is earth a bird or bee ?</l>
     <l n="3">Can this uncharted boundless realm of ours</l>
     <l n="4">Drone thro ’ the sky , with leagues of struggling sea ,</l>
     <l n="5">Forests , and hills , and towns , and palace-towers ? ”</l>
     <l n="6">“ Ay , ” said the dwarf ,</l>
     <l n="7">“ I have watched from Stiernborg 's crown</l>
     <l n="8">Her far dark rim uplift against the sky ;</l>
     <l n="9">But , while earth soars , men say the stars go down ;</l>
     <l n="10">And , while earth sails , men say the stars go by . ”</l>
     <l n="11">An elvish tale !</l>
     <l n="12">Ask Jeppe , the dwarf ! He knows .</l>
     <l n="13">That 's why his eyes look fey ; for , chuckling deep ,</l>
     <l n="14">Heels over head amongst the stars he goes ,</l>
     <l n="15">As all men go ; but most are sound asleep .</l>
     <l n="16">King , saint , sage ,</l>
     <l n="17">Even those that count it true ,</l>
     <l n="18">Act as this miracle touched them not at all .</l>
     <l n="19">They are borne , undizzied , thro ’ the rushing blue ,</l>
     <l n="20">And build their empires on a sky-tossed ball .</l>

     <l n="23">What of my realm ? O , what shall now stand sure ? ”</l>
     <l n="24">“ Naught , ” said the dwarf , “ in all this world , but love .</l>
     <l n="25">All else is dream-stuff and shall not endure .</l>
     <l n="26">‘ Tis nearer now !</l>
     <l n="27">Our universe hath no centre ,</l>
     <l n="28">Our shadowy earth and fleeting heavens no stay ,</l>
     <l n="29">But that deep inward realm which each can enter ,</l>
     <l n="30">Even Jeppe , the dwarf , by his own secret way . ”</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="31">“ Where ? ” said the king ,</l>
     <l n="32">“ O , where ? I have not found it ! ”</l>

     <l n="34">“ This infinite circle hath no line to bound it ;</l>

     <l n="37">Or plunge to the pit , His covenant still holds true .</l>
     <l n="38">In the heart of a dying bird , the Master hideth ;</l>
     <l n="39">In the soul of a king , ” said the dwarf ,</l>

      <l n="41">Princes and courtiers came , a few to seek</l>
      <l n="42">A little knowledge , many more to gape</l>
      <l n="43">In wonder at Tycho 's gold and silver mask ;</l>
      <l n="44">Or when they saw the beauty of his towers ,</l>
      <l n="45">Envy and hate him for them .</l>
      <l n="46">Thus arose</l>
      <l n="47">The small grey cloud upon the distant sky ,</l>
      <l n="48">That broke in storm at last .</l>
      <l n="49">“ Beware , ” croaked Jeppe ,</l>
      <l n="50">Lifting his shaggy head beside the fire ,</l>

      <l n="54">His anger , like a momentary breeze ,</l>
      <l n="55">Died on the dreaming deep ; for Tycho Brahe</l>
      <l n="56">Turned to a nobler riddle ,— “ Have you thought , ”</l>
      <l n="57">He asked his young disciples , “ how the sea</l>
      <l n="58">Is moved to that strange rhythm we call the tides ?</l>
      <l n="59">He that can answer this shall have his name</l>
      <l n="60">Honoured among the bearers of the torch</l>
      <l n="61">While Pegasus flies above Uraniborg .</l>
      <l n="62">I was delayed three hours or more to-day</l>
      <l n="63">By the neap-tide . The fishermen on the coast</l>
      <l n="64">Are never wrong . They time it by the moon .</l>
      <l n="65">Post hoc , perhaps , not propter hoc ; and yet</l>
      <l n="66">Through all the changes of the sky and sea</l>
      <l n="67">That old white clock of ours with the battered face</l>
      <l n="68">Does seem infallible .</l>
      <l n="69">There 's a love-song too ,</l>
      <l n="70">The sailors on the coast of Sweden sing ,</l>
      <l n="71">I have often pondered it . Your courtly poets</l>
      <l n="72">Upbraid the inconstant moon . But these men know</l>
      <l n="73">The moon and sea are lovers , and they move</l>
      <l n="74">In a most constant measure . Hear the words</l>
      <l n="75">And tell me , if you can , what silver chains</l>
      <l n="76">Bind them together . ” Then , in a voice as low</l>
      <l n="77">And rhythmical as the sea , he spoke that song :</l>

      <l n="27">He was a great magician , Tycho Brahe ,</l>
      <l n="28">But not so great that he could read the heart</l>
      <l n="29">Or rule the hand of princes .</l>
      <l n="30">When his friend</l>
      <l n="31">King Frederick died , the young Prince Christian reigned ;</l>
      <l n="32">And , round him , fool and knave made common cause</l>
      <l n="33">Against the magic that could pour their gold</l>
      <l n="34">Into a gulf of stars . This Tycho Brahe</l>
      <l n="35">Had grown too proud . He held them in contempt ,</l>
      <l n="36">So they believed ; for , when he spoke , their thoughts</l>
      <l n="37">Crept at his feet like spaniels . Junkerdom</l>
      <l n="38">Felt it was foolish , for he towered above it ,</l>
      <l n="39">And so it hated him . Did he not spend</l>
      <l n="40">Gold that a fool could spend as quickly as he ?</l>
      <l n="41">Were there not great estates bestowed upon him</l>
      <l n="42">In wisdom 's name , that from the dawn of time</l>
      <l n="43">Had been the natural right of Junkerdom ?</l>
      <l n="44">And would he not bequeath them to his heirs ,</l>
      <l n="45">The children of Christine , an unfree woman ?</l>
      <l n="46">“ Why you , sire , even you , ” they told the king ,</l>
      <l n="47">“ He has made a laughing-stock . That horoscope</l>
      <l n="48">He read for you , the night when you were born ,</l>
      <l n="49">Printed , and bound it in green velvet , too ,—</l>
      <l n="50">Read it The whole world laughs at it . He said</l>
      <l n="51">That Venus was the star that ruled your fate ,</l>
      <l n="52">And Venus would destroy you . Tycho Brahe</l>
      <l n="53">Inspired your royal father with the fear</l>
      <l n="54">That kept your youth so long in leading-strings ,</l>
      <l n="55">The fear that every pretty hedgerow flower</l>
      <l n="56">Would be your Circe . So he thought to avenge</l>
      <l n="57">Our mockery of this peasant-girl Christine ,</l>
      <l n="58">To whom , indeed , he plays the faithful swine ,</l>
      <l n="59">Knowing full well his gold and silver nose</l>
      <l n="60">Would never win another . ”</l>
      <l n="61">Thus the sky</l>
      <l n="62">Darkened above Uraniborg , and those</l>
      <l n="63">Who dwelt within it , till one evil day ,</l>
      <l n="64">One seeming happy day , when Tycho marked</l>
      <l n="65">The seven-hundredth star upon his chart ,</l>
      <l n="66">Two pompous officers from Walchendorp ,</l>
      <l n="67">The chancellor , knocked at Tycho 's eastern gate .</l>
      <l n="68">“ We are sent , ” they said , “ to see and to report</l>
      <l n="69">What use you make of these estates of yours .</l>
      <l n="70">Your alchemy has turned more gold to lead</l>
      <l n="71">Than Denmark can approve . The uses now !</l>
      <l n="72">Show us the uses of this work of yours . ”</l>
      <l n="73">Then Tycho showed his tables of the stars ,</l>
      <l n="74">Seven hundred stars , each noted in its place</l>
      <l n="75">With exquisite precision , the result</l>
      <l n="76">Of watching heaven for five-and-twenty years .</l>
      <l n="77">“ And is this all ? ” they said .</l>
      <l n="78">They sought to invent</l>
      <l n="79">Some ground for damning him . The truth alone</l>

      <l n="81">Who could not understand .</l>
      <l n="82">“ Not all , I hope , ”</l>

      <l n="85">“ To what end ?</l>
      <l n="86">When shall we reap the fruits of all this toil ?</l>
      <l n="87">Show us its uses . ”</l>
      <l n="88">“ In the time to come , ”</l>
      <l n="89">Said Tycho Brahe , “ perhaps a hundred years ,</l>
      <l n="90">Perhaps a thousand , when our own poor names</l>
      <l n="91">Are quite forgotten , and our kingdoms dust ,</l>
      <l n="92">On one sure certain day , the torch-bearers</l>

      <l n="98">A new creation rising from the deep ,</l>
      <l n="99">Beautiful , whole .</l>
      <l n="100">We are like men that hear</l>

      <l n="102">Year after year , we patiently record</l>
      <l n="103">All we can gather . In that far-off time ,</l>
      <l n="104">A people that we have not known shall hear them ,</l>

      <l n="240">This earth of ours , as Jeppe declared one day ,</l>

      <l n="244">But let the sun with all its planets move</l>
      <l n="245">Around our central earth .</l>
      <l n="246">This at the least</l>
      <l n="247">Accords with all we know , and saves mankind</l>

      <l n="302">Into whose hands can I entrust it all ?</l>
      <l n="303">I thought to find him standing by the way ,</l>

      <l n="311">Of Europe by the starlight in his eyes ,</l>
      <l n="312">Or that invisible hand which guides the world .</l>
      <l n="313">He asked him , as the runner with the torch</l>
      <l n="314">Alone could ask , asked as a natural right</l>
      <l n="315">For Tycho 's hard-won life-work , those results ,</l>
      <l n="316">His tables of the stars . He gave his name</l>

      <l n="319">Not famous yet , though truth had marked him out</l>
      <l n="320">Already , by his exile , as her own ,—</l>
      <l n="321">The name of Johann Kepler .</l>
      <l n="322">“ It was strange , ”</l>
      <l n="323">Wrote Kepler , not long after , “ for I asked</l>
      <l n="324">Unheard-of things , and yet he gave them to me</l>
      <l n="325">As if I were his son . When first I saw him ,</l>
      <l n="326">We seemed to have known each other years ago</l>
      <l n="327">In some forgotten world . I could not guess</l>
      <l n="328">That Tycho Brahe was dying . He was quick</l>
      <l n="329">Of temper , and we quarrelled now and then ,</l>
      <l n="330">Only to find ourselves more closely bound</l>
      <l n="331">Than ever . I believe that Tycho died</l>
      <l n="332">Simply of heartache for his native land .</l>
      <l n="333">For though he always met me with a smile ,</l>
      <l n="334">Or jest upon his lips , he could not sleep</l>
      <l n="335">Or work , and often unawares I caught</l>
      <l n="336">Odd little whispered phrases on his lips</l>
      <l n="337">As if he talked to himself , in a kind of dream .</l>
      <l n="338">Yet I believe the clouds dispersed a little</l>
      <l n="339">Around his death-bed , and with that strange joy</l>
      <l n="340">Which comes in death , he saw the unchanging stars .</l>
      <l n="341">Christine was there . She held him in her arms .</l>
      <l n="342">I think , too , that he knew his work was safe .</l>
      <l n="343">An hour before he died , he smiled at me ,</l>
      <l n="344">And whispered ,— what he meant I hardly know —</l>
      <l n="345">Perhaps a broken echo from the past ,</l>
      <l n="346">A fragment of some old familiar thought ,</l>
      <l n="347">And yet I seemed to know . It haunts me still :</l>
      <l n="348">‘ Come then , swift-footed , let me see you stand ,</l>
      <l n="349">Waiting before me , crowned with youth and joy ;</l>
      <l n="350">This is the turning . Take it from my hand .</l>

     <l n="1">John Kepler , from the chimney corner , watched</l>
     <l n="2">His wife Susannah , with her sleeves rolled back</l>
     <l n="3">Making a salad in a big blue bowl .</l>
     <l n="4">The thick tufts of his black rebellious hair</l>
     <l n="5">Brushed into sleek submission ; his trim beard</l>
     <l n="6">Snug as the soft round body of a thrush</l>
     <l n="7">Between the white wings of his fan-shaped ruff</l>
     <l n="8">( His best , with the fine lace border ) spoke of guests</l>
     <l n="9">Expected ; and his quick grey humorous eyes ,</l>
     <l n="10">His firm red whimsical pleasure-loving mouth ,</l>
     <l n="11">And all those elvish twinklings of his face ,</l>
     <l n="12">Were lit with eagerness . Only between his brows ,</l>
     <l n="13">Perplexed beneath that subtle load of dreams ,</l>
     <l n="14">Two delicate shadows brooded .</l>
     <l n="15">“ What does it mean ?</l>
     <l n="16">Sir Henry Wotton 's letter breathed a hint</l>
     <l n="17">That Italy is prohibiting my book , ”</l>

     <l n="19">Susannah mine , we may be forced to choose</l>
     <l n="20">Between the truth and exile . When he comes ,</l>
     <l n="21">He 'll tell me more . Ambassadors , I suppose ,</l>
     <l n="22">Can only write in cipher , while our world</l>
     <l n="23">Is steered to heaven by murderers and thieves ;</l>
     <l n="24">But , if he 'd wrapped his friendly warnings up</l>
     <l n="25">In a verse or two , I might have done more work</l>
     <l n="26">These last three days , eh , Sue ? ”</l>
     <l n="27">“ Look , John , ” said she ,</l>
     <l n="28">“ What beautiful hearts of lettuce ! Tell me now</l>
     <l n="29">How shall I mix it ? Will your English guest</l>
     <l n="30">Turn up his nose at dandelion leaves</l>
     <l n="31">As crisp and young as these ? They 've just the tang</l>
     <l n="32">Of bitterness in their milk that gives a relish</l>
     <l n="33">And makes all sweet ; and that 's philosophy , John .</l>
     <l n="34">Now — these spring onions ! Would his Excellency</l>
     <l n="35">Like sugared rose-leaves better ? ”</l>
     <l n="36">“ He 's a poet ,</l>

     <l n="39">“ A poet , John !</l>
     <l n="40">I hate their arrogant little insect ways !</l>

     <l n="42">“ Poets , dear heart ,</l>
     <l n="43">Can be divided into two clear kinds ,—</l>
     <l n="44">One that , by virtue of a half-grown brain ,</l>
     <l n="45">Lives in a silly world of his own making ,</l>
     <l n="46">A bubble , blown by himself , in which he flits</l>
     <l n="47">And dizzily bombinates , chanting ‘ I , I , I , ’</l>
     <l n="48">For there is nothing in the heavens above</l>
     <l n="49">Or the earth , or hell beneath , but goes to swell</l>
     <l n="50">His personal pronoun . Bring him some dreadful news</l>
     <l n="51">His dearest friend is burned to death ,— You 'll see</l>
     <l n="52">The monstrous insect strike an attitude</l>
     <l n="53">And shape himself into one capital I ,</l>
     <l n="54">A rubric , with red eyes . You 'll see him use</l>
     <l n="55">The coffin for his pedestal , hear him mouth</l>
     <l n="56">His ‘ I , I , I ’ instructing haggard grief</l>
     <l n="57">Concerning his odd ego . Does he chirp</l>
     <l n="58">Of love , it 's ‘ I , I , I ’ Narcissus , love ,</l>
     <l n="59">Myself , Narcissus , imaged in those eyes ;</l>
     <l n="60">For all the love-notes that he sounds are made</l>
     <l n="61">After the fashion of passionate grasshoppers ,</l>
     <l n="62">By grating one hind-leg across another .</l>
     <l n="63">Nor does he learn to sound that mellower ‘ You , ’</l>
     <l n="64">Until his bubble bursts and leaves him drowned ,</l>
     <l n="65">An insect in a soap-sud .</l>
     <l n="66">But there 's another kind , whose mind still moves</l>
     <l n="67">In vital concord with the soul of things ;</l>
     <l n="68">So that it thinks in music , and its thoughts</l>
     <l n="69">Pulse into natural song . A separate voice ,</l>
     <l n="70">And yet caught up by the surrounding choirs ,</l>
     <l n="71">There , in the harmonies of the Universe ,</l>
     <l n="72">Losing himself , he saves his soul alive . ”</l>
     <l n="73">“ John , I 'm afraid ! ” —</l>
     <l n="74">“ Afraid of what , Susannah ? ” —</l>
     <l n="75">“ Afraid to put those Ducklings on to roast .</l>
     <l n="76">Your friend may miss his road ; and , if he 's late ,</l>

     <l n="78">“ He wo n't , Susannah . Bad poets are always late .</l>
     <l n="79">Good poets , at times , delay a note or two ;</l>
     <l n="80">But all the great are punctual as the sun .</l>
     <l n="81">What 's that ? He 's early ! That 's his knock , I think ! ” —</l>
     <l n="82">“ The Lord have mercy , John , there 's nothing ready !</l>

     <l n="84">Talk hard . He 's come an hour before his time ;</l>

     <l n="86">Then , in a moment , all the cottage rang</l>

     <l n="106">“ Kepler , have you not heard</l>
     <l n="107">Of those who , fifteen hundred years ago ,</l>
     <l n="108">Had eyes and would not see ? Eyes quickly close</l>

     <l n="110">“ So be it . Other and younger eyes will see .</l>
     <l n="111">Perhaps that 's why God gave the young a spice</l>

     <l n="118">Would find it hard to leave her native land .</l>
     <l n="119">Say nothing yet before her . ”</l>
     <l n="120">Then , to hide</l>
     <l n="121">Their secret from Susannah , Kepler poured</l>
     <l n="122">His mind out , and the world 's dead branches bloomed .</l>
     <l n="123">For , when he talked , another spring began</l>
     <l n="124">To which our May was winter ; and , in the boughs</l>
     <l n="125">Of his delicious thoughts , like feathered choirs ,</l>
     <l n="126">Bits of old rhyme , scraps from the Sabine farm ,</l>
     <l n="127">Celestial phrases from the Shepherd King ,</l>
     <l n="128">And fluttering morsels from Catullus sang .</l>
     <l n="129">Much was fantastic . All was touched with light</l>
     <l n="130">That only genius knows to steal from heaven .</l>
     <l n="131">He spoke of poetry , as the “ flowering time</l>
     <l n="132">Of knowledge , ” called it “ thought in passionate tune</l>
     <l n="133">With those great rhythms that steer the moon and sun ;</l>
     <l n="134">Thought in such concord with the soul of things</l>
     <l n="135">That it can only move , like tides and stars ,</l>
     <l n="136">And man 's own beating heart , and the wings of birds ,</l>
     <l n="137">In law , whose service only sets them free . ”</l>
     <l n="138">Therefore it often leaps to the truth we seek ,</l>
     <l n="139">Clasping it , as a lover clasps his bride</l>
     <l n="140">In darkness , ere the sage can light his lamp .</l>
     <l n="141">And so , in music , men might find the road</l>
     <l n="142">To truth , at many a point , where sages grope .</l>
     <l n="143">One day , a greater Plato would arise</l>
     <l n="144">To write a new philosophy , he said ,</l>
     <l n="145">Showing how music is the golden clue</l>
     <l n="146">To all the windings of the world 's dark maze .</l>
     <l n="147">Himself had used it , partly proved it , too ,</l>
     <l n="148">In his own book ,— the Harmonies of the World .</l>
     <l n="149">‘ All that the years discover points one way</l>
     <l n="150">To this great ordered harmony , ” he said ,</l>
     <l n="151">“ Revealed on earth by music . Planets move</l>
     <l n="152">In subtle accord like notes of one great song</l>
     <l n="153">Audible only to the Artificer ,</l>
     <l n="154">The Eternal Artist . There 's no grief , no pain ,</l>
     <l n="155">But music — follow it simply as a clue ,</l>
     <l n="156">A microcosmic pattern of the whole —</l>
     <l n="157">Can show you , somewhere in its golden scheme ,</l>
     <l n="158">The use of all such discords ; and , at last ,</l>
     <l n="159">Their exquisite solution . Then darkness breaks</l>
     <l n="160">Into diviner light , love 's agony climbs</l>
     <l n="161">Through death to life , and evil builds up heaven .</l>
     <l n="162">Have you not heard , in some great symphony ,</l>
     <l n="163">Those golden mathematics making clear</l>
     <l n="164">The victory of the soul ? Have you not heard</l>
     <l n="165">The very heavens opening ?</l>
     <l n="166">Do those fools</l>
     <l n="167">Who thought me an infidel then , still smile at me</l>
     <l n="168">For trying to read the stars in terms of song ,</l>
     <l n="169">Discern their orbits , measure their distances ,</l>
     <l n="170">By musical proportions ? Let them smile ,</l>
     <l n="171">My folly at least revealed those three great laws ;</l>
     <l n="172">Gave me the golden vases of the Egyptians ,</l>
     <l n="173">To set in the great new temple of my God</l>
     <l n="174">Beyond the bounds of Egypt .</l>
     <l n="175">They will forget</l>
     <l n="176">My methods , doubtless , as the years go by ,</l>
     <l n="177">And the world 's wisdom shuts its music out .</l>
     <l n="178">The dust will gather on all my harmonies ;</l>
     <l n="179">Or scholars turn my pages listlessly ,</l>
     <l n="180">Glance at the musical phrases , and pass on ,</l>
     <l n="181">Not troubling even to read one Latin page .</l>
     <l n="182">Yet they 'll accept those great results as mine .</l>
     <l n="183">I call them mine . How can I help exulting ,</l>
     <l n="184">Who climbed my ladder of music to the skies</l>
     <l n="185">And found , by accident , let them call it so ,</l>
     <l n="186">Or by the inspiration of that Power</l>
     <l n="187">Which built His world of music , those three laws :—</l>
     <l n="188">First , how the speed of planets round the sun</l>
     <l n="189">Bears a proportion , beautifully precise</l>
     <l n="190">As music , to their silver distances ;</l>
     <l n="191">Next , that although they seem to swerve aside</l>
     <l n="192">From those plain circles of old Copernicus</l>
     <l n="193">Their paths were not less rhythmical and exact ,</l>
     <l n="194">But followed always that most exquisite curve</l>
     <l n="195">In its most perfect form , the pure ellipse ;</l>
     <l n="196">Third , that although their speed from point to point</l>
     <l n="197">Appeared to change , their radii always moved</l>
     <l n="198">Through equal fields of space in equal times .</l>
     <l n="199">Was this my infidelity , was this</l>
     <l n="200">Less full of beauty , less divine in truth ,</l>
     <l n="201">Than their dull chaos ? You , the poet will know</l>
     <l n="202">How , as those dark perplexities grew clear ,</l>
     <l n="203">And old anomalous discords changed to song ,</l>
     <l n="204">My whole soul bowed and cried , Almighty God</l>
     <l n="205">These are Thy thoughts , I am thinking after Thee !</l>
     <l n="206">I hope that Tycho knows . I owed so much</l>
     <l n="207">To Tycho Brahe ; for it was he who built</l>
     <l n="208">The towers from which I hailed those three great laws .</l>
     <l n="209">How strange and far away it all seems now .</l>
     <l n="210">The thistles grow upon that little isle</l>
     <l n="211">Where Tycho 's great Uraniborg once was .</l>
     <l n="212">Yet , for a few sad years , before it fell</l>
     <l n="213">Into decay and ruin , there was one</l>
     <l n="214">Who crept about its crumbling corridors ,</l>
     <l n="215">And lit the fire of memory on its hearth . ” —</l>
     <l n="216">Wotton looked quickly up , “ I think I have heard</l>
     <l n="217">Something of that . You mean poor Jeppe , his dwarf .</l>
     <l n="218">Fynes Moryson , at the Mermaid Inn one night</l>
     <l n="219">Showed a most curious manuscript , a scrawl</l>
     <l n="220">On yellow parchment , crusted here and there</l>
     <l n="221">With sea-salt , or the salt of those thick tears</l>
     <l n="222">Creatures like Jeppe , the crooked dwarf , could weep .</l>
     <l n="223">It had been found , clasped in a crooked hand ,</l>
     <l n="224">Under the cliffs of Wheen , a crooked hand</l>
     <l n="225">That many a time had beckoned to passing ships ,</l>
     <l n="226">Hoping to find some voyager who would take</l>
     <l n="227">A letter to its master .</l>
     <l n="228">The sailors laughed</l>
     <l n="229">And jeered at him , till Jeppe threw stones at them .</l>
     <l n="230">And now Jeppe , too , was dead , and one who knew</l>
     <l n="231">Fynes Moryson , had found him , and brought home</l>
     <l n="232">That curious crooked scrawl . Fynes Englished it</l>
     <l n="233">Out of its barbarous Danish . Thus it ran :</l>
     <l n="234">‘ Master , have you forgotten Jeppe , your dwarf ,</l>
     <l n="235">Who used to lie beside the big log-fire</l>

     <l n="239">I too am crying , Master , even I ,</l>
     <l n="240">Because there is no fire upon the hearth ,</l>
     <l n="241">No light in any window . It is night ,</l>

     <l n="246">I lay among the wild flowers on the cliff</l>

     <l n="249">But gulls and jackdaws , wheeling round my head ,</l>

     <l n="260">“ He is free now , ” said Kepler , “ had he lived</l>

     <l n="262">At Prague . But death forestalled him , and your King .</l>
     <l n="263">The years in which he watched that planet Mars ,</l>
     <l n="264">His patient notes and records , all were mine ;</l>
     <l n="265">And , mark you , had he clipped or trimmed one fact</l>
     <l n="266">By even a hair'shYpppHeNbreadth , so that his results</l>
     <l n="267">Made a pure circle of that planet 's path</l>
     <l n="268">It might have baffled us for an age and drowned</l>
     <l n="269">All our new light in darkness . But he held</l>
     <l n="270">To what he saw . He might so easily ,</l>
     <l n="271">So comfortably have said , ‘ My instruments</l>

     <l n="275">For one slight clash of seeming fact with faith ? ’</l>
     <l n="276">But no , though stars might swerve , he held his course ,</l>
     <l n="277">Recording only what his eyes could see</l>
     <l n="278">Until death closed them .</l>
     <l n="279">Then , to his results ,</l>
     <l n="280">I added mine and saw , in one wild gleam ,</l>
     <l n="281">Strange as the light of day to one born blind ,</l>
     <l n="282">A subtler concord ruling them and heard</l>
     <l n="283">Profounder tones of harmony resolve</l>

     <l n="285">“ Faintly and far away , I , too , have seen</l>
     <l n="286">In music , and in verse , that golden clue</l>
     <l n="287">Whereof you speak , ” said Wotton . “ In all true song ,</l>
     <l n="288">There is a hidden logic . Even the rhyme</l>
     <l n="289">That , in bad poets , wrings the neck of thought ,</l>

     <l n="395">Epicureans , little they know of him</l>
     <l n="396">Who , even in utter darkness , bowed his head ,</l>
     <l n="397">To something nobler than the gods of Rome</l>
     <l n="398">Reigning beyond the darkness .</l>
     <l n="399">They accept</l>
     <l n="400">The law , the music of these ordered worlds ;</l>
     <l n="401">And straight deny the law 's first postulate ,</l>
     <l n="402">That out of nothingness nothing can be born ,</l>
     <l n="403">Nor greater things from less . Can music rise</l>
     <l n="404">By chance from chaos , as they said that star</l>
     <l n="405">In Serpentarius rose ? I told them , then ,</l>
     <l n="406">That when I was a boy , with time to spare ,</l>
     <l n="407">I played at anagrams . Out of my Latin name</l>
     <l n="408">Johannes Keplerus came that sinister phrase</l>
     <l n="409">Serpens in akuleo . Struck by this ,</l>
     <l n="410">I tried again , but trusted it to chance .</l>
     <l n="411">I took some playing cards , and wrote on each</l>
     <l n="412">One letter of my name . Then I began</l>
     <l n="413">To shuffle them ; and , at every shuffle , I read</l>
     <l n="414">The letters , in their order , as they came ,</l>
     <l n="415">To see what meaning chance might give to them .</l>
     <l n="416">Wotton , the gods and goddesses must have laughed</l>
     <l n="417">To see the weeks I lost in studying chance ;</l>
     <l n="418">For had I scattered those cards into the black</l>
     <l n="419">Epicurean eternity , I 'll swear</l>
     <l n="420">They 'd still be playing at leap-frog in the dark ,</l>
     <l n="421">And show no glimmer of sense . And yet — to hear</l>
     <l n="422">Those wittols talk , you 'd think you 'd but to mix</l>
     <l n="423">A bushel of good Greek letters in a sack</l>
     <l n="424">And shake them roundly for an age or so ,</l>
     <l n="425">To pour the Odyssey out .</l>
     <l n="426">At last , I told ,</l>
     <l n="427">Those disputants what my wife had said . One night</l>
     <l n="428">When I was tired and all my mind a-dust</l>
     <l n="429">With pondering on their atoms , I was called</l>
     <l n="430">To supper , and she placed before me there</l>
     <l n="431">A most delicious salad . ‘ It would appear , ’</l>
     <l n="432">I thought aloud , ‘ that if these pewter dishes ,</l>
     <l n="433">Green hearts of lettuce , tarragon , slips of thyme ,</l>
     <l n="434">Slices of hard boiled egg , and grains of salt .</l>
     <l n="435">With drops of water , vinegar and oil ,</l>
     <l n="436">Had in a bottomless gulf been flying about</l>
     <l n="437">From all eternity , one sure certain day</l>
     <l n="438">The sweet invisible hand of Happy Chance</l>
     <l n="439">Would serve them as a salad . ’</l>
     <l n="440">‘ Likely enough , ’</l>
     <l n="441">My wife replied , ‘ but not so good as mine ,</l>
     <l n="442">Nor so well dressed . ’ ”</l>
     <l n="443">They laughed . Susannah 's voice</l>
     <l n="444">Broke in , “ I 've made a better one . The receipt</l>
     <l n="445">Came from the Golden Lion . I have dished</l>
     <l n="446">Ducklings and peas and all . Come , John , say grace . ”</l>

     <lg type="stanza" n="2">
      <l n="3">My friend , my dearest friend , my own dear love ,</l>
      <l n="4">I , who am dead to love , and see around me</l>
      <l n="5">The funeral tapers lighted , send this cry</l>
      <l n="6">Out of my heart to yours , before the end .</l>
      <l n="7">You told me once you would endure the rack</l>
      <l n="8">To save my heart one pang . O , save it now !</l>
      <l n="9">Last night there came a dreadful word from Rome</l>
      <l n="10">For my dear lord and father , summoning him</l>
      <l n="11">Before the inquisitors there , to take his trial</l>
      <l n="12">At threescore years and ten . There is a threat</l>
      <l n="13">Of torture , if his lips will not deny</l>
      <l n="14">The truth his eyes have seen .</l>
      <l n="15">You know my father ,</l>
      <l n="16">You know me , too . You never will believe</l>
      <l n="17">That he and I are enemies of the faith .</l>
      <l n="18">Could I , who put away all earthly love ,</l>
      <l n="19">Deny the Cross to which I nailed this flesh ?</l>
      <l n="20">Could he , who , on the night when all those heavens</l>
      <l n="21">Opened above us , with their circling worlds ,</l>
      <l n="22">Knelt with me , crushed beneath that weight of glory ,</l>
      <l n="23">Forget the Maker of that glory now ?</l>
      <l n="24">You 'll not believe it . Neither would the Church ,</l>
      <l n="25">Had not his enemies poisoned all the springs</l>
      <l n="26">And fountain-heads of truth . It is not Rome</l>
      <l n="27">That summons him , but Magini , Sizy , Scheiner ,</l>
      <l n="28">Lorini , all the blind , pedantic crew</l>
      <l n="29">That envy him his fame , and hate his works</l>
      <l n="30">For dwarfing theirs .</l>
      <l n="31">Must such things always be</l>
      <l n="32">When truth is born ?</l>
      <l n="33">Only five nights ago we walked together ,</l>
      <l n="34">My father and I , here in the Convent garden ;</l>
      <l n="35">And , as the dusk turned everything to dreams ,</l>
      <l n="36">We dreamed together of his work well done</l>
      <l n="37">And happiness to be . We did not dream</l>
      <l n="38">That even then , muttering above his book ,</l>
      <l n="39">His enemies , those enemies whom the truth</l>
      <l n="40">Stings into hate , were plotting to destroy him .</l>
      <l n="41">Yet something shadowed him . I recall his words —</l>
      <l n="42">“ The grapes are ripening . See , Celeste , how black</l>
      <l n="43">And heavy . We shall have good wine this year , ” —</l>
      <l n="44">“ Yes , all grows ripe , ” I said , “ your life-work , too ,</l>
      <l n="45">Dear father . Are you happy now to know</l>
      <l n="46">Your book is printed , and the new world born ? ”</l>
      <l n="47">He shook his head , a little sadly , I thought .</l>
      <l n="48">“ Autumn 's too full of endings . Fruits grow ripe</l>
      <l n="49">And fall , and then comes winter . ”</l>
      <l n="50">“ Not for you !</l>
      <l n="51">Never , ” I said , “ for those who write their names</l>
      <l n="52">In heaven . Think , father , through all ages now</l>
      <l n="53">No one can ever watch that starry sky</l>
      <l n="54">Without remembering you . Your fame ... ”</l>
      <l n="55">And there</l>
      <l n="56">He stopped me , laid his hand upon my arm ,</l>
      <l n="57">And standing in the darkness with dead leaves</l>
      <l n="58">Drifting around him , and his bare grey head</l>
      <l n="59">Bowed in complete humility , his voice</l>
      <l n="60">Shaken and low , he said like one in prayer ,</l>
      <l n="61">“ Celeste , beware of that . Say truth , not fame .</l>
      <l n="62">If there be any happiness on earth ,</l>
      <l n="63">It springs from truth alone , the truth we live</l>
      <l n="64">In act and thought . I have looked up there and seen</l>
      <l n="65">Too many worlds to talk of fame on earth .</l>
      <l n="66">Fame , on this grain of dust among the stars ,</l>
      <l n="67">The trumpet of a gnat that thinks to halt</l>
      <l n="68">The great sun-clusters moving on their way</l>
      <l n="69">In silence ! Yes , that 's fame , but truth , Celeste ,</l>
      <l n="70">Truth and its laws are constant , even up there ;</l>
      <l n="71">That 's where one man may face and fight the world .</l>
      <l n="72">His weakness turns to strength . He is made one</l>
      <l n="73">With universal forces , and he holds</l>
      <l n="74">The password to eternity .</l>
      <l n="75">Gate after gate swings back through all the heavens .</l>
      <l n="76">No sentry halts him , and no flaming sword .</l>
      <l n="77">Say truth , Celeste , not fame . ”</l>
      <l n="78">“ No , for I 'll say</l>
      <l n="79">A better word , ” I told him . “ I 'll say love . ”</l>
      <l n="80">He took my face between his hands and said —</l>
      <l n="81">His face all dark between me and the stars —</l>
      <l n="82">“ What 's love , Celeste , but this dear face of truth</l>
      <l n="83">Upturned to heaven . ”</l>
      <l n="84">He left me , and I heard ,</l>
      <l n="85">Some twelve hours later , that this man whose soul</l>
      <l n="86">Was dedicate to Truth , was threatened now</l>
      <l n="87">With torture , if his lips did not deny</l>
      <l n="88">The truth he loved .</l>
      <l n="89">I tell you all these things</l>
      <l n="90">Because to help him , you must understand him ;</l>
      <l n="91">And even you may doubt him , if you hear</l>
      <l n="92">Only those plausible outside witnesses</l>
      <l n="93">Who never heard his heart-beats as have I .</l>
      <l n="94">So let me tell you all — his quest for truth ,</l>
      <l n="95">And how this hate began .</l>
      <l n="96">Even from the first ,</l>
      <l n="97">He made his enemies of those almost-minds</l>
      <l n="98">Who chanced upon some new thing in the dark</l>
      <l n="99">And could not see its meaning , for he saw ,</l>
      <l n="100">Always , the law illumining it within .</l>
      <l n="101">So when he heard of that strange optic-glass</l>
      <l n="102">Which brought the distance near , he thought it out</l>
      <l n="103">By reason , where that other hit upon it</l>
      <l n="104">Only by chance . He made his telescope ;</l>
      <l n="105">And O , how vividly that day comes back ,</l>
      <l n="106">When in their gorgeous robes the Senate stood</l>
      <l n="107">Beside him on that high Venetian tower ,</l>
      <l n="108">Scanning the bare blue sea that showed no speck</l>
      <l n="109">Of sail . Then , one by one , he bade them look ;</l>
      <l n="110">And one by one they gasped , “ a miracle . ”</l>
      <l n="111">Brown sails and red , a fleet of fishing boats ,</l>
      <l n="112">See how the bright foam bursts around their bows !</l>
      <l n="113">See how the bare-legged sailors walk the decks !</l>
      <l n="114">Then , quickly looking up , as if to catch</l>
      <l n="115">The vision , ere it tricked them , all they saw</l>
      <l n="116">Was empty sea again .</l>
      <l n="117">Many believed</l>
      <l n="118">That all was trickery , but he bade them note</l>
      <l n="119">The colours of the boats , and count their sails .</l>
      <l n="120">Then , in a little while , the naked eye</l>
      <l n="121">Saw on the sky-line certain specks that grew ,</l>
      <l n="122">Took form and colour ; and , within an hour ,</l>
      <l n="123">Their magic fleet came foaming into port .</l>
      <l n="124">Whereat old senators , wagging their white beards ,</l>
      <l n="125">And plucking at golden chains with stiff old claws</l>
      <l n="126">Too feeble for the sword-hilt , squeaked at once :</l>
      <l n="127">“ This glass will give us great advantages</l>
      <l n="128">In time of war . ”</l>
      <l n="129">War , war , O God of love ,</l>
      <l n="130">Even amidst their wonder at Thy world ,</l>
      <l n="131">Dazed with new beauty , gifted with new powers ,</l>
      <l n="132">These old men dreamed of blood . This was the thought</l>
      <l n="133">To which all else must pander , if he hoped</l>
      <l n="134">Even for one hour to see those dull eyes blaze</l>
      <l n="135">At his discoveries .</l>
      <l n="136">“ Wolves , ” he called them , “ wolves ” ;</l>
      <l n="137">And yet he humoured them . He stooped to them .</l>
      <l n="138">Promised them more advantages , and talked</l>
      <l n="139">As elders do to children . You may call it</l>
      <l n="140">Weakness , and yet could any man do more ,</l>
      <l n="141">Alone , against a world , with such a trust</l>
      <l n="142">To guard for future ages ? All his life</l>
      <l n="143">He has had some weanling truth to guard , has fought</l>
      <l n="144">Desperately to defend it , taking cover</l>
      <l n="145">Wherever he could , behind old fallen trees</l>
      <l n="146">Of superstition , or ruins of old thought .</l>
      <l n="147">He has read horoscopes to keep his work</l>
      <l n="148">Among the stars in favour with his prince ,</l>
      <l n="149">I tell you this that you may understand</l>
      <l n="150">What seems inconstant in him . It may be</l>
      <l n="151">That he was wrong in these things , and must pay</l>
      <l n="152">A dreadful penalty . But you must explore</l>
      <l n="153">His mind 's great ranges , plains and lonely peaks</l>
      <l n="154">Before you know him , as I know him now .</l>
      <l n="155">How could he talk to children , but in words</l>
      <l n="156">That children understand ? Have not some said</l>
      <l n="157">That God Himself has made His glory dark</l>
      <l n="158">For men to bear it . In his human sphere</l>
      <l n="159">My father has done this .</l>
      <l n="160">War was the dream</l>
      <l n="161">That filmed those old men 's eyes . They did not hear</l>
      <l n="162">My father , when he hinted at his hope</l>
      <l n="163">Of opening up the heavens for mankind</l>
      <l n="164">With that new power of bringing far things near .</l>
      <l n="165">My heart burned as I heard him ; but they blinked</l>
      <l n="166">Like owls at noonday . Then I saw him turn ,</l>
      <l n="167">Desperately , to humour them , from thoughts</l>
      <l n="168">Of heaven to thoughts of warfare .</l>
      <l n="169">Late that night</l>
      <l n="170">My own dear lord and father came to me</l>
      <l n="171">And whispered , with a glory in his face</l>
      <l n="172">As one who has looked on things too beautiful</l>
      <l n="173">To breathe aloud , “ Come out , Celeste , and see</l>
      <l n="174">A miracle . ”</l>
      <l n="175">I followed him . He showed me ,</l>
      <l n="176">Looking along his outstretched hand , a star ,</l>
      <l n="177">A point of light above our olive-trees .</l>
      <l n="178">It was the star called Jupiter . And then</l>
      <l n="179">He bade me look again , but through his glass .</l>
      <l n="180">I feared to look at first , lest I should see</l>
      <l n="181">Some wonder never meant for mortal eyes .</l>
      <l n="182">He too , had felt the same , not fear , but awe ,</l>
      <l n="183">As if his hand were laid upon the veil</l>
      <l n="184">Between this world and heaven .</l>
      <l n="185">Then . . . I , too , saw ,</l>
      <l n="186">Small as the smallest bead of mist that clings</l>
      <l n="187">To a spider 's thread at dawn , the floating disk</l>
      <l n="188">Of what had been a star , a planet now ,</l>
      <l n="189">And near it , with no disk that eyes could see ,</l>
      <l n="190">Four needle-points of light , unseen before .</l>
      <l n="191">“ The moons of Jupiter , ” he whispered low ,</l>
      <l n="192">“ I have watched them as they moved , from night to night ;</l>
      <l n="193">A system like our own , although the world</l>
      <l n="194">Their fourfold lights and shadows make so strange</l>
      <l n="195">Must — as I think — be mightier than we dreamed ,</l>
      <l n="196">A Titan planet . Earth begins to fade</l>
      <l n="197">And dwindle ; yes , the heavens are opening now .</l>
      <l n="198">Perhaps up there , this night , some lonely soul</l>
      <l n="199">Gazes at earth , watches our dawning moon ,</l>
      <l n="200">And wonders , as we wonder . ”</l>
      <l n="201">In that dark</l>
      <l n="202">We knelt together . . .</l>
      <l n="203">Very strange to see</l>
      <l n="204">The vanity and fickleness of princes .</l>
      <l n="205">Before his enemies had provoked the wrath</l>
      <l n="206">Of Rome against him , he had given the name</l>
      <l n="207">Of Medicean stars to those four moons</l>
      <l n="208">In honour of Prince Cosmo . This aroused</l>
      <l n="209">The court of France to seek a lasting place</l>
      <l n="210">Upon the map of heaven . A letter came</l>
      <l n="211">Beseeching him to find another star</l>
      <l n="212">Even more brilliant , and to call it Henri</l>
      <l n="213">After the reigning and most brilliant prince</l>
      <l n="214">Of France . They did not wish the family name</l>
      <l n="215">Of Bourbon . This would dissipate the glory .</l>
      <l n="216">No , they preferred his proper name of Henri .</l>
      <l n="217">We read it together in the garden here ,</l>
      <l n="218">Weeping with laughter , never dreaming then</l>
      <l n="219">That this , this , this , could stir the little hearts</l>
      <l n="220">Of men to envy .</l>
      <l n="221">O , but afterwards ,</l>
      <l n="222">The blindness of the men who thought themselves</l>
      <l n="223">His enemies . The men who never knew him ,</l>
      <l n="224">The men that had set up a thing of straw</l>
      <l n="225">And called it by his name , and wished to burn</l>
      <l n="226">Their image and himself in one wild fire .</l>
      <l n="227">Men ? Were they men or children ? They refused</l>
      <l n="228">Even to look through Galileo 's glass ,</l>
      <l n="229">Lest seeing might persuade them . Even that sage ,</l>
      <l n="230">That great Aristotelian , Julius Libri ,</l>
      <l n="231">Holding his breath there , like a fractious child</l>
      <l n="232">Until his cheeks grew purple , and the veins</l>
      <l n="233">Were bursting on his brow , swore he would die</l>
      <l n="234">Sooner than look .</l>
      <l n="235">And that poor monstrous babe</l>
      <l n="236">Not long thereafter , kept his word and died ,</l>
      <l n="237">Died of his own pent rage , as I have heard .</l>
      <l n="238">Whereat my lord and father shook his head</l>
      <l n="239">And , smiling , somewhat sadly — oh , you know</l>
      <l n="240">That smile of his , more deadly to the false</l>
      <l n="241">Than even his reasoning — murmured , “ Libri , dead ,</l>
      <l n="242">Who called the moons of Jupiter absurd !</l>
      <l n="243">He swore he would not look at them from earth ,</l>

      <l n="245">Welser in Augsburg , Clavius at Rome ,</l>

      <l n="531">At unseen glories , in this deeper night ,</l>
      <l n="532">Make new discoveries of profounder realms ,</l>
      <l n="533">Within the soul ? O , could I find Him there ,</l>
      <l n="534">Rise to Him through His harmonies of law</l>
      <l n="535">And make His will my own !</l>
      <l n="536">This much , at least ,</l>
      <l n="537">I know already , that — in some strange way —</l>
      <l n="538">His law implies His love ; for , failing that</l>
      <l n="539">All grows discordant , and the primal Power</l>
      <l n="540">Ignobler than His children .</l>
      <l n="541">So I trust</l>
      <l n="542">One day to find her , waiting for me still ,</l>
      <l n="543">When all things are made new .</l>
      <l n="544">I raise this torch</l>
      <l n="545">Of knowledge . It is one with my right hand ,</l>
      <l n="546">And the dark sap that keeps it burning flows</l>
      <l n="547">Out of my heart ; and yet , for all my faith ,</l>
      <l n="548">It shows me only darkness .</l>
      <l n="549">Was I wrong ?</l>
      <l n="550">Did I forget the subtler truth of Rome</l>
      <l n="551">And , in my pride , obscure the world 's one light ?</l>
      <l n="552">Did I subordinate to this moving earth</l>
      <l n="553">Our swiftlier-moving God ?</l>
      <l n="554">O , my Celeste ,</l>
      <l n="555">Once , once at least , you knew far more than I ;</l>
      <l n="556">And she is dead , Castelli , she is dead .</l>

      <l n="557">( Viviani , many years later , writes to a friend in England )</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="12">
      <l n="558">I was his last disciple , as you say</l>
      <l n="559">I went to him , at seventeen years of age ,</l>
      <l n="560">And offered him my hands and eyes to use ,</l>
      <l n="561">When , voicing the true mind and heart of Rome ,</l>
      <l n="562">Father Castelli , his most faithful friend ,</l>
      <l n="563">Wrote , for my master , that compassionate plea ;</l>
      <l n="564">The noblest eye that Nature ever made</l>
      <l n="565">Is darkened ; one so exquisitely dowered ,</l>
      <l n="566">So delicate in power that it beheld</l>
      <l n="567">More than all other eyes in ages gone</l>
      <l n="568">And opened the eyes of all that are to come .</l>
      <l n="569">But , out of England , even then , there shone</l>
      <l n="570">The first ethereal promise of light</l>
      <l n="571">That crowns my master dead . Well I recall</l>
      <l n="572">That day of days . There was no faintest breath</l>
      <l n="573">Among his garden cypress-trees . They dreamed</l>
      <l n="574">Dark , on a sky too beautiful for tears ,</l>
      <l n="575">And the first star was trembling overhead ,</l>
      <l n="576">When , quietly as a messenger from heaven ,</l>
      <l n="577">Moving unseen , through his own purer realm ,</l>
      <l n="578">Amongst the shadows of our mortal world ,</l>
      <l n="579">A young man , with a strange light on his face</l>
      <l n="580">Knocked at the door of Galileo 's house .</l>
      <l n="581">His name was Milton .</l>
      <l n="582">By the hand of God ,</l>
      <l n="583">He , the one living soul on earth with power</l>
      <l n="584">To read the starry soul of this blind man ,</l>
      <l n="585">Was led through Italy to his prison door .</l>
      <l n="586">He looked on Galileo , touched his hand ...</l>
      <l n="587">O , dark , dark , dark , amid the blaze of noon ,</l>
      <l n="588">Irrecoverably dark ....</l>
      <l n="589">In after days ,</l>
      <l n="590">He wrote it ; but it pulsed within him then ;</l>
      <l n="591">And Galileo rising to his feet</l>
      <l n="592">And turning on him those unseeing eyes</l>
      <l n="593">That had searched heaven and seen so many worlds ,</l>
      <l n="594">Said to him , “ You have found me . ”</l>
      <l n="595">Often he told me in those last sad months</l>
      <l n="596">Of how your grave young island poet brought</l>
      <l n="597">Peace to him , with the knowledge that , far off ,</l>
      <l n="598">In other lands , the truth he had proclaimed</l>
      <l n="599">Was gathering power .</l>
      <l n="600">Soon after , death unlocked</l>
      <l n="601">His prison , and the city that he loved ,</l>
      <l n="602">Florence , his town of flowers , whose gates in life</l>
      <l n="603">He was forbid to pass , received him dead .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="13">
      <l n="604">You write to me from England , that his name</l>
      <l n="605">Is now among the mightiest in the world ,</l>
      <l n="606">And in his name I thank you .</l>
      <l n="607">I am old ;</l>
      <l n="608">And I was very young when , long ago ,</l>
      <l n="609">I stood beside his poor dishonoured grave</l>
      <l n="610">Where hate denied him even an epitaph ;</l>
      <l n="611">And I have seen , slowly and silently ,</l>
      <l n="612">His purer fame arising , like a moon</l>
      <l n="613">In marble on the twilight of those aisles</l>
      <l n="614">At Santa Croce , where the dread decree</l>
      <l n="615">Was read against him .</l>
      <l n="616">Now , against two wrongs ,</l>
      <l n="617">Let me defend two victims : first , the Church</l>
      <l n="618">Whom many have vilified for my master 's doom ;</l>
      <l n="619">And second , Galileo , whom they reproach</l>
      <l n="620">Because they think that in his blind old age</l>
      <l n="621">He might with one great eagle 's glance have cowed</l>
      <l n="622">His judges , played the hero , raised his hands</l>
      <l n="623">Above his head , and posturing like a mummer</l>
      <l n="624">Cried ( as one empty rumour now declares )</l>
      <l n="625">After his recantation — yet , it moves !</l>
      <l n="626">Out of this wild confusion , fourfold wrongs</l>
      <l n="627">Are heaped on both sides .— I would fain bring peace ,</l>
      <l n="628">The peace of truth to both before I die ;</l>
      <l n="629">And , as I hope , rest at my master 's feet .</l>
      <l n="630">It was not Rome that tried to murder truth ;</l>
      <l n="631">But the blind hate and vanity of man .</l>
      <l n="632">Had Galileo but concealed the smile</l>
      <l n="633">With which , like Socrates , he answered fools ,</l>
      <l n="634">They would not , in the name of Christ , have mixed</l>
      <l n="635">This hemlock in his chalice .</l>
      <l n="636">O pitiful</l>
      <l n="637">Pitiful human hearts that must deny</l>
      <l n="638">Their own unfolding heavens , for one light word</l>
      <l n="639">Twisted by whispering malice .</l>
      <l n="640">Did he mean</l>
      <l n="641">Simplicio , in his dialogues , for the Pope ?</l>
      <l n="642">Doubtful enough — the name was borrowed straight</l>
      <l n="643">From older dialogues .</l>
      <l n="644">If he gave one thought</l>
      <l n="645">Of Urban 's to Simplicio — you know well</l>
      <l n="646">How composite are all characters in books ,</l>
      <l n="647">How authors find their colours here and there ,</l>
      <l n="648">And paint both saints and villains from themselves .</l>
      <l n="649">No matter . This was Urban . Make it clear .</l>
      <l n="650">Simplicio means a simpleton . The saints</l>
      <l n="651">Are aroused by ridicule to most human wrath .</l>
      <l n="652">Urban was once his friend . This hint of ours</l>
      <l n="653">Kills all of that . And so we mortals close</l>
      <l n="654">The doors of Love and Knowledge on the world .</l>
      <l n="655">And so , for many an age , the name of Christ</l>
      <l n="656">Has been misused by man to mask man 's hate .</l>
      <l n="657">How should the Church escape , then ? I who loved</l>
      <l n="658">My master , know he had no truer friend</l>
      <l n="659">Than many of those true servants of the Church ,</l>
      <l n="660">Fathers and priests who , in their lowlier sphere ,</l>
      <l n="661">Moved nearer than her cardinals to the Christ .</l>
      <l n="662">These were the very Rome , and held her keys .</l>
      <l n="663">Those who charge Rome with hatred of the light</l>
      <l n="664">Would charge the sun with darkness , and accuse</l>
      <l n="665">This dome of sky for all the blood-red wrongs</l>
      <l n="666">That men commit beneath it . Art and song</l>
      <l n="667">That found her once in Europe their sole shrine</l>
      <l n="668">And sanctuary absolve her from that stain .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="14">
      <l n="669">But there 's this other charge against my friend ,</l>
      <l n="670">And master , Galileo . It is brought</l>
      <l n="671">By friends , made sharper by their pity and grief ,</l>
      <l n="672">The charge that he refused his martyrdom</l>
      <l n="673">And so denied his own high faith .</l>
      <l n="674">Whose faith ,—</l>
      <l n="675">His friends ’ , his Protestant followers ’ , or his own ?</l>
      <l n="676">Faced by the torture , that sublime old man</l>
      <l n="677">Was still a faithful Catholic , and his thought</l>
      <l n="678">Plunged deeper than his Protestant followers knew .</l>
      <l n="679">His aim was not to strike a blow at Rome</l>
      <l n="680">But to confound his enemies . He believed</l>
      <l n="681">As humbly as Castelli or Celeste</l>
      <l n="682">That there is nothing absolute but that Power</l>
      <l n="683">With which his Church confronted him . To this</l>
      <l n="684">He bowed his head , acknowledging that his light</l>
      <l n="685">Was darkness ; but affirming , all the more ,</l>
      <l n="686">That Ptolemy 's light was even darker yet .</l>
      <l n="687">Read your own Protestant Milton , who derived</l>
      <l n="688">His mighty argument from my master 's lips :</l>
      <l n="689">“ Whether the sun predominant in heaven</l>
      <l n="690">Rise on the earth , or earth rise on the sun ;</l>
      <l n="691">Leave them to God above ; Him serve and fear . ”</l>
      <l n="692">Just as in boyhood , when my master watched</l>
      <l n="693">The swinging lamp in the cathedral there</l>
      <l n="694">At Pisa ; and , by one finger on his pulse ,</l>
      <l n="695">Found that , although the great bronze miracle swung</l>
      <l n="696">Through ever-shortening spaces , yet it moved</l>
      <l n="697">More slowly , and so still swung in equal times ;</l>
      <l n="698">He straight devised another boon to man ,</l>
      <l n="699">Those pulse-clocks which by many a fevered bed</l>
      <l n="700">Our doctors use ; dreamed of that timepiece , too ,</l>
      <l n="701">Whose punctual swinging pendulum on earth</l>
      <l n="702">Measures the starry periods , and to-day</l>
      <l n="703">Talks peacefully to children by the fire</l>
      <l n="704">Like an old grandad full of ancient tales ,</l>
      <l n="705">Remembering endless ages , and foretelling</l>
      <l n="706">Eternities to come ; but , all the while</l>
      <l n="707">There , in the dim cathedral , he knew well ,</l>
      <l n="708">That dreaming youngster , with his tawny mane</l>
      <l n="709">Of red-gold hair , and deep ethereal eyes ,</l>
      <l n="710">What odorous clouds of incense round him rose ;</l>
      <l n="711">Was conscious in the dimness , of great throngs</l>
      <l n="712">Kneeling around him ; shared in his own heart</l>
      <l n="713">The music and the silence and the cry ,</l>
      <l n="714">O , salutaris hostia !— so now ,</l>
      <l n="715">There was no mortal conflict in his mind</l>
      <l n="716">Between his dream-clocks and things absolute ,</l>
      <l n="717">And one far voice , most absolute of all ,</l>
      <l n="718">Feeble with suffering , calling night and day</l>
      <l n="719">“ Return , return ; ” the voice of his Celeste .</l>
      <l n="720">All these things co-existed , and the less</l>
      <l n="721">Were comprehended , like the swinging lamp ,</l>
      <l n="722">Within that great cathedral of his soul .</l>
      <l n="723">Often he bade me , in that desolate house</l>
      <l n="724">Il Giojello , of old a jewel of light ,</l>
      <l n="725">Read to him one sad letter , till he knew</l>
      <l n="726">The most of it by heart , and while he walked</l>
      <l n="727">His garden , leaning on my arm , at times</l>
      <l n="728">I think he quite forgot that I was there ;</l>
      <l n="729">For he would quietly murmur it to himself ,</l>
      <l n="730">As if she had sent it , half an hour ago :</l>
      <l n="731">“ Now , with this little winter 's gift of fruit</l>
      <l n="732">I send you , father , from our southward wall ,</l>
      <l n="733">Our convent 's rarest flower , a Christmas rose .</l>
      <l n="734">At this cold season , it should please you much ,</l>
      <l n="735">Seeing how rare it is ; but , with the rose ,</l>
      <l n="736">You must accept its thorns , which bring to mind</l>
      <l n="737">Our Lord 's own bitter Passion . Its green leaves</l>
      <l n="738">Image the hope that through His Passion we ,</l>
      <l n="739">After this winter of our mortal life ,</l>
      <l n="740">May find the beauty of an eternal spring</l>
      <l n="741">In heaven . ”</l>
      <l n="742">Praise me the martyr , out of whose agonies</l>
      <l n="743">Some great new hope is born , but not the fool</l>
      <l n="744">Who starves his heart to prove what eyes can see</l>
      <l n="745">And intellect confirm throughout the world .</l>
      <l n="746">Why must he follow the idiot schoolboy code ,</l>
      <l n="747">Torture his soul to reinforce the sight</l>
      <l n="748">Of those that closed their eyes and would not see .</l>
      <l n="749">To your own men of science , fifty turns</l>
      <l n="750">Of the thumbscrew would not prove that earth revolved .</l>
      <l n="751">Call it Italian subtlety if you will ,</l>
      <l n="752">I say his intricate cause could not be won</l>
      <l n="753">By blind heroics . Much that his enemies challenged</l>
      <l n="754">Was not yet wholly proven , though his mind</l>
      <l n="755">Had leapt to a certainty . He must leave the rest</l>
      <l n="756">To those that should come after , swift and young ,—</l>
      <l n="757">Those runners with the torch for whom he longed</l>
      <l n="758">As his deliverers . Had he chosen death</l>
      <l n="759">Before his hour , his proofs had been obscured</l>
      <l n="760">For many a year . His respite gave him time</l>
      <l n="761">To push new pawns out , in the blindfold play</l>
      <l n="762">Of those last months , and checkmate , not the Church</l>
      <l n="763">But those that hid behind her . He believed</l>
      <l n="764">His truth was all harmonious with her own .</l>
      <l n="765">How could he choose between them ? Must he die</l>
      <l n="766">To affirm a discord that himself denied ?</l>
      <l n="767">On many a point , he was less sure than we :</l>
      <l n="768">But surer far of much that we forget</l>
      <l n="769">The movements that he saw he could but judge</l>
      <l n="770">By some fixed point in space . He chose the sun .</l>
      <l n="771">Could this be absolute ? Could he then be sure</l>
      <l n="772">That this great sun did not with all its worlds</l>
      <l n="773">Move round a deeper centre ? What became</l>
      <l n="774">Of your Copernicus then ? Could he be sure</l>
      <l n="775">Of any unchanging centre , whence to judge</l>
      <l n="776">This myriad-marching universe , but one —</l>
      <l n="777">The absolute throne of God .</l>
      <l n="778">Affirming this</l>
      <l n="779">Eternal Rock , his own uncertainties</l>
      <l n="780">Became more certain , and although his lips</l>
      <l n="781">Breathed not a syllable of it , though he stood</l>
      <l n="782">Silent as earth that also seemed so still ,</l>
      <l n="783">The very silence thundered , yet it moves !</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="15">
      <l n="784">He held to what he knew , secured his work</l>
      <l n="785">Through feeble hands like mine , in other lands ,</l>
      <l n="786">Not least in England , as I think you know .</l>
      <l n="787">For , partly through your poet , as I believe ,</l>
      <l n="788">When his great music rolled upon your skies ,</l>
      <l n="789">New thoughts were kindled in the general mind .</l>
      <l n="790">‘ Twas at Arcetri that your Milton gained</l>
      <l n="791">The first great glimpse of his celestial realm .</l>
      <l n="792">Picture him ,— still a prisoner of our light ,</l>
      <l n="793">Closing his glorious eyes — that in the dark ,</l>
      <l n="794">He might behold this wheeling universe ,—</l>
      <l n="795">The planets gilding their ethereal horns</l>
      <l n="796">With sun-fire . Many a pure immortal phrase</l>
      <l n="797">In his own work , as I have pondered it ,</l>
      <l n="798">Lived first upon the lips of him whose eyes</l>
      <l n="799">Were darkened first ,— in whom , too , Milton found</l>
      <l n="800">That Samson Agonistes , not himself ,</l>
      <l n="801">As many have thought , but my dear master dead .</l>
      <l n="802">These are a part of England 's memories now ,</l>
      <l n="803">The music blown upon her sea-bright air</l>
      <l n="804">When , in the year of Galileo 's death ,</l>
      <l n="805">Newton , the mightiest of the sons of light ,</l>
      <l n="806">Was born to lift the splendour of this torch</l>
      <l n="807">And carry it , as I heard that Tycho said</l>
      <l n="808">Long since to Kepler , “ carry it out of sight ,</l>
      <l n="809">Into the great new age I must not know ,</l>
      <l n="810">Into the great new realm I must not tread . ”</l>

      <l n="3">Too proud of his great line to slight the toils</l>
      <l n="4">Of his forebears . He turned to their dim past ,</l>
      <l n="5">Their fading victories and their fond defeats ,</l>
      <l n="6">And knelt as at an altar , drawing all</l>

      <l n="298">All through the night ; and , in the morning greyness</l>
      <l n="299">Went down to chapel , leaving on his desk</l>
      <l n="300">A lighted candle . You can imagine it ,—</l>
      <l n="301">A sadly sloven altar to his Muse ,</l>
      <l n="302">Littered with papers , cups , and greasy plates</l>
      <l n="303">Of untouched food . I am told that he would eat</l>
      <l n="304">His Monday 's breakfast , sir , on Tuesday morning ,</l>
      <l n="305">Such was his absent way !</l>
      <l n="306">When he returned ,</l>
      <l n="307">He found that Diamond ( his little dog</l>
      <l n="308">Named Diamond , for a black patch near his tail )</l>
      <l n="309">Had overturned the candle . All his work</l>
      <l n="310">Was burned to ashes .</l>
      <l n="311">It struck him to the quick ,</l>
      <l n="312">Though , when his terrier fawned about his feet ,</l>
      <l n="313">He showed no anger . He was heard to say ,</l>
      <l n="314">‘ O Diamond , Diamond , little do you know ... ’</l>

      <l n="371">Each Christmas , carrying each some glimpse of home .</l>
      <l n="372">There 's one I love that shows the narrow lane</l>
      <l n="373">Behind the schoolhouse , where I had that bout</l>

      <l n="381">There was a patch of aromatic flowers ,—</l>

      <l n="383">Pluck at the harrow ; halt the sharp harrow of thought ,</l>

      <l n="387">Until you join me , and we dream together .</l>
      <l n="388">They called me lazy , then . Oddly enough</l>

      <l n="390">My bully at his books , and head the school ;</l>
      <l n="391">Blind rivalry , at first . By such fond tricks</l>
      <l n="392">The invisible Power that shapes us — not ourselves —</l>

      <l n="396">Into full knowledge that our Guide was Love .</l>
      <l n="397">Another picture shows those woods of ours ,</l>

      <l n="540">They can do nothing that the sun and rain</l>

      <l n="542">Can hurt that noble memory . Think of him</l>
      <l n="543">As of a viper writhing at the base</l>

      <l n="552">How the town buzzed that Newton had gone mad .</l>
      <l n="553">You copy me that sad letter which he wrote</l>
      <l n="554">To Locke , wherein he begs him to forgive</l>
      <l n="555">The hard words he had spoken , thinking Locke</l>
      <l n="556">Had tried to embroil him , as he says , with women ;</l>
      <l n="557">A piteous , humble letter .</l>
      <l n="558">Had he heard</l>
      <l n="559">Some hint of scandal that he could not breathe</l>
      <l n="560">To you , because he honoured you too well ?</l>
      <l n="561">I cannot tell . His mind was greatly troubled</l>
      <l n="562">With other things . At least , you need not fear</l>
      <l n="563">That Newton thought it true . He walked aloof ,</l>
      <l n="564">Treading a deeper stranger world than ours .</l>
      <l n="565">Have you not told me how he would forget</l>
      <l n="566">Even to eat and drink , when he was wrapt</l>
      <l n="567">In those miraculous new discoveries</l>
      <l n="568">And , under this wild maze of shadow and sun</l>
      <l n="569">Beheld — though not the Master Player 's hand —</l>
      <l n="570">The keys from which His organ music rolls ,</l>
      <l n="571">Those visible symphonies of wild cloud and light</l>
      <l n="572">Which clothe the invisible world for mortal eyes .</l>
      <l n="573">I have heard that Leibnitz whispered to the court</l>

      <l n="577">That knowledge drives out wonder from the world ;</l>
      <l n="578">They 'll say it still , though all the dust 's ablaze</l>
      <l n="579">With miracles at their feet ; while Newton 's laws</l>
      <l n="580">Foretell that knowledge one day shall be song ,</l>
      <l n="581">And those whom Truth has taken to her heart</l>
      <l n="582">Find that it beats in music .</l>
      <l n="583">Even this age</l>
      <l n="584">Has glimmerings of it . Newton never saw</l>
      <l n="585">His own full victory ; but at least he knew</l>
      <l n="586">That all the world was linked in one again ;</l>
      <l n="587">And , if men found new worlds in years to come ,</l>
      <l n="588">These too must join the universal song .</l>
      <l n="589">That 's why true poets love him ; and you 'll find</l>
      <l n="590">Their love will cancel all that hate can do .</l>
      <l n="591">They are the sentinels of the House of Fame ;</l>
      <l n="592">And that quick challenging couplet from the pen</l>
      <l n="593">Of Alexander Pope is answer enough</l>
      <l n="594">To all those whisperers round the outer doors .</l>
      <l n="595">There 's Addison , too . The very spirit and thought</l>
      <l n="596">Of Newton moved to music when he wrote</l>
      <l n="597">The Spacious Firmament . Some keen-eyed age to come</l>
      <l n="598">Will say , though Newton seldom wrote a verse ,</l>
      <l n="599">That music was his own and speaks his faith .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="24">
      <l n="600">And , last , for those who doubt his faith in God</l>
      <l n="601">And man 's immortal destiny , there remains</l>
      <l n="602">The granite monument of his own great work ,</l>
      <l n="603">That dark cathedral of man 's intellect ,</l>
      <l n="604">The vast “ Principia , ” pointing to the skies ,</l>
      <l n="605">Wherein our intellectual king proclaimed</l>
      <l n="606">The task of science ,— through this wilderness</l>
      <l n="607">Of Time and Space and false appearances ,</l>
      <l n="608">To make the path straight from effect to cause ,</l>
      <l n="609">Until we come to that First Cause of all ,</l>
      <l n="610">The Power , above , beyond the blind machine ,</l>
      <l n="611">The Primal Power , the originating Power ,</l>
      <l n="612">Which cannot be mechanical . He affirmed it</l>
      <l n="613">With absolute certainty . Whence arises all</l>
      <l n="614">This order , this unbroken chain of law ,</l>
      <l n="615">This human will , this death-defying love ?</l>
      <l n="616">Whence , but from some divine transcendent Power ,</l>
      <l n="617">Not less , but infinitely more than these ,</l>
      <l n="618">Because it is their Fountain and their Guide .</l>
      <l n="619">Fools in their hearts have said , “ Whence comes this Power ,</l>
      <l n="620">Why throw the riddle back this one stage more ? ”</l>
      <l n="621">And Newton , from a height above all worlds</l>
      <l n="622">Answered and answers still :</l>
      <l n="623">“ This universe</l>
      <l n="624">Exists , and by that one impossible fact</l>
      <l n="625">Declares itself a miracle ; postulates</l>
      <l n="626">An infinite Power within itself , a Whole</l>
      <l n="627">Greater than any part , a Unity</l>
      <l n="628">Sustaining all , binding all worlds in one .</l>
      <l n="629">This is the mystery , palpable here and now .</l>
      <l n="630">‘ Tis not the lack of links within the chain</l>
      <l n="631">From cause to cause , but that the chain exists .</l>
      <l n="632">That 's the unfathomable mystery ,</l>
      <l n="633">The one unquestioned miracle that we know ,</l>
      <l n="634">Implying every attribute of God ,</l>
      <l n="635">The ultimate , absolute , omnipresent Power ,</l>
      <l n="636">In its own being , deep and high as heaven .</l>
      <l n="637">But men still trace the greater to the less ,</l>
      <l n="638">Account for soul with flesh and dreams with dust ,</l>
      <l n="639">Forgetting in their manifold world the One ,</l>
      <l n="640">In whom for every splendour shining here</l>
      <l n="641">Abides an equal power behind the veil .</l>
      <l n="642">Was the eye contrived by blindly moving atoms ,</l>
      <l n="643">Or the still-listening ear fulfilled with music</l>
      <l n="644">By forces without knowledge of sweet sounds ?</l>
      <l n="645">Are nerves and brain so sensitively fashioned</l>
      <l n="646">That they convey these pictures of the world</l>
      <l n="647">Into the very substance of our life ,</l>
      <l n="648">While That from which we came , the Power that made us ,</l>
      <l n="649">Is drowned in blank unconsciousness of all ?</l>
      <l n="650">Does it not from the things we know appear</l>
      <l n="651">That there exists a Being , incorporeal ,</l>
      <l n="652">Living , intelligent , who in infinite space ,</l>
      <l n="653">As in His infinite sensory , perceives</l>
      <l n="654">Things in themselves , by His immediate presence</l>
      <l n="655">Everywhere ? Of which things , we see no more</l>
      <l n="656">Than images only , flashed through nerves and brain</l>
      <l n="657">To our small sensories ?</l>
      <l n="658">What is all science then</l>
      <l n="659">But pure religion , seeking everywhere</l>
      <l n="660">The true commandments , and through many forms</l>
      <l n="661">The eternal power that binds all worlds in one ?</l>
      <l n="662">It is man 's age-long struggle to draw near</l>
      <l n="663">His Maker , learn His thoughts , discern His law ,—</l>
      <l n="664">A boundless task , in whose infinitude ,</l>
      <l n="665">As in the unfolding light and law of love .</l>
      <l n="666">Abides our hope , and our eternal joy .</l>
      <l n="667">I know not how my work may seem to others — ”</l>
      <l n="668">So wrote our mightiest mind — “ But to myself</l>
      <l n="669">I seem a child that wandering all day long</l>
      <l n="670">Upon the sea-shore , gathers here a shell ,</l>
      <l n="671">And there a pebble , coloured by the wave ,</l>
      <l n="672">While the great ocean of truth , from sky to sky</l>
      <l n="673">Stretches before him , boundless , unexplored . ”</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="25">
      <l n="674">He has explored it now , and needs of me</l>
      <l n="675">Neither defence nor tribute . His own work</l>
      <l n="676">Remains his monument He rose at last so near</l>
      <l n="677">The Power divine that none can nearer go ;</l>
      <l n="678">None in this age ! To carry on his fire</l>
      <l n="679">We must await a mightier age to come .</l>

     <l n="1">Was it a dream ?— that crowded concert-room</l>
     <l n="2">In Bath ; that sea of ruffles and laced coats ;</l>
     <l n="3">And William Herschel , in his powdered wig ,</l>
     <l n="4">Waiting upon the platform , to conduct</l>
     <l n="5">His choir and Linley 's orchestra ? He stood</l>
     <l n="6">Tapping his music-rest , lost in his own thoughts</l>
     <l n="7">And ( did I hear or dream them ? ) all were mine :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="8">My periwig 's askew , my ruffle stained</l>
     <l n="9">With grease from my new telescope !</l>
     <l n="10">Ach , to-morrow</l>
     <l n="11">How Caroline will be vexed , although she grows</l>
     <l n="12">Almost as bad as I , who cannot leave</l>
     <l n="13">My work-shop for one evening .</l>
     <l n="14">I must give</l>
     <l n="15">One last recital at St. Margaret 's ,</l>
     <l n="16">And then — farewell to music .</l>
     <l n="17">Who can lead</l>
     <l n="18">Two lives at once ?</l>
     <l n="19">Yet — it has taught me much ,</l>
     <l n="20">Thrown curious lights upon our world , to pass</l>
     <l n="21">From one life to another . Much that I took</l>
     <l n="22">For substance turns to shadow . I shall see</l>
     <l n="23">No throngs like this again ; wring no more praise</l>
     <l n="24">Out of their hearts ; forego that instant joy</l>
     <l n="25">— Let those who have not known it count it vain —</l>
     <l n="26">When human souls at once respond to yours .</l>
     <l n="27">Here , on the brink of fortune and of fame ,</l>
     <l n="28">As men account these things , the moment comes</l>
     <l n="29">When I must choose between them and the stars ;</l>
     <l n="30">And I have chosen .</l>
     <l n="31">Handel , good old friend ,</l>
     <l n="32">We part to-night . Hereafter , I must watch</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="34">What has decided me ? That marvelous night</l>
     <l n="35">When — ah , how difficult it will be to guide ,</l>
     <l n="36">With all these wonders whirling through my brain !—</l>
     <l n="37">After a Pump-room concert I came home</l>
     <l n="38">Hot-foot , out of the fluttering sea of fans ,</l>
     <l n="39">Coquelicot-ribboned belles and periwigged beaux ,</l>
     <l n="40">To my Newtonian telescope .</l>
     <l n="41">The design</l>
     <l n="42">Was his ; but more than half the joy my own ,</l>
     <l n="43">Because it was the work of my own hand ,</l>
     <l n="44">A new one , with an eye six inches wide ,</l>
     <l n="45">Better than even the best that Newton made .</l>
     <l n="46">Then , as I turned it on the Gemini ,</l>
     <l n="47">And the deep stillness of those constant lights ,</l>
     <l n="48">Castor and Pollux , lucid pilot-stars ,</l>
     <l n="49">Began to calm the fever of my blood ,</l>
     <l n="50">I saw , O , first of all mankind I saw</l>
     <l n="51">The disk of my new planet gliding there</l>
     <l n="52">Beyond our tumults , in that realm of peace .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="53">What will they christen it ? Ach — not Herschel , no !</l>
     <l n="54">Nor Georgium Sidus , as I once proposed ;</l>
     <l n="55">Although he scarce could lose it , as he lost</l>
     <l n="56">That world in ‘ seventy-six .</l>
     <l n="57">Indeed , so far</l>
     <l n="58">From trying to tax it , he has granted me</l>
     <l n="59">How much ?— two hundred golden pounds a year ,</l>
     <l n="60">In the great name of science ,— half the cost</l>
     <l n="61">Of one state-coach , with all those worlds to win !</l>
     <l n="62">Well — well — we must be grateful . This mad king</l>
     <l n="63">Has done far more than all the worldly-wise ,</l>
     <l n="64">Who 'll charge even this to madness .</l>
     <l n="65">I believe</l>
     <l n="66">One day he 'll have me pardoned for that ... crime ,</l>
     <l n="67">When I escaped — deserted , some would say —</l>
     <l n="68">From those drill-sergeants in my native land ;</l>
     <l n="69">Deserted drill for music , as I now</l>
     <l n="70">Desert my music for the orchestral spheres .</l>
     <l n="71">No . This new planet is only new to man .</l>
     <l n="72">His majesty has done much . Yet , as my friend</l>
     <l n="73">Declared last night , “ Never did monarch buy</l>
     <l n="74">Honour so cheaply ” ; and — he has not bought it .</l>
     <l n="75">I think that it should bear some ancient name ,</l>
     <l n="76">And wear it like a crown ; some deep , dark name ,</l>
     <l n="77">Like Uranus , known to remoter gods .</l>

     <l n="78">How strange it seems — this buzzing concert-room !</l>
     <l n="79">There 's Doctor Burney bowing and , behind him ,</l>
     <l n="80">His fox-eyed daughter Fanny .</l>
     <l n="81">Is it a dream ,</l>
     <l n="82">These crowding midgets , dense as clustering bees</l>
     <l n="83">In some great bee-skep ?</l>
     <l n="84">Now , as I lift my wand ,</l>
     <l n="85">A silence grips them , and the strings begin ,</l>
     <l n="86">Throbbing . The faint lights flicker in gusts of sound .</l>
     <l n="87">Before me , glimmering like a crescent moon ,</l>
     <l n="88">The dim half circle of the choir awaits</l>
     <l n="89">Its own appointed time .</l>
     <l n="90">Beside me now ,</l>
     <l n="91">Watching my wand , plump and immaculate</l>
     <l n="92">From buckled shoes to that white bunch of lace</l>
     <l n="93">Under his chin , the midget tenor rises ,</l>
     <l n="94">Music in hand , a linnet and a king .</l>
     <l n="95">The bullfinch bass , that other emperor ,</l>
     <l n="96">Leans back indifferently , and clears his throat</l>
     <l n="97">As if to say , “ This prelude leads to Me ! ”</l>
     <l n="98">While , on their own proud thrones , on either hand ,</l>
     <l n="99">The sumptuously bosomed midget queens ,</l>
     <l n="100">Contralto and soprano , jealously eye</l>
     <l n="101">Each other 's plumage .</l>
     <l n="102">Round me the music throbs</l>
     <l n="103">With an immortal passion . I grow aware</l>

     <l n="105">Of midgets , playing , listening , tense and still ,</l>
     <l n="106">Are sailing on a midget ball of dust</l>
     <l n="107">We call our planet ; will have sailed through space</l>
     <l n="108">Ten thousand leagues before this music ends .</l>
     <l n="109">What does it mean ? Oh , God , what can it mean ?—</l>
     <l n="110">This weird hushed ant-hill with a thousand eyes ;</l>
     <l n="111">These midget periwigs ; all those little blurs ,</l>
     <l n="112">Tier over tier , of faces , masks of flesh ,</l>
     <l n="113">Corruptible , hiding each its hopes and dreams ,</l>
     <l n="114">Its tragi-comic dreams .</l>
     <l n="115">And all this throng</l>
     <l n="116">Will be forgotten , mixed with dust , crushed out ,</l>
     <l n="117">Before this book of music is outworn</l>
     <l n="118">Or that tall organ crumbles . Violins</l>
     <l n="119">Outlast their players . Other hands may touch</l>
     <l n="120">That harpsichord ; but ere this planet makes</l>
     <l n="121">Another threescore journeys round its sun ,</l>
     <l n="122">These breathing listeners will have vanished . Whither ?</l>
     <l n="123">I watch my moving hands , and they grow strange !</l>
     <l n="124">What is it moves this body ? What am I ?</l>
     <l n="125">How came I here , a ghost , to hear that voice</l>
     <l n="126">Of infinite compassion , far away ,</l>

     <l n="131">As long ago I sought to understand</l>
     <l n="132">Its golden mathematics ; taught myself</l>

     <l n="145">I see beyond this island universe ,</l>
     <l n="146">Beyond our sun , and all those other suns</l>
     <l n="147">That throng the Milky Way , far , far beyond ,</l>
     <l n="148">A thousand little wisps , faint nebulae ,</l>
     <l n="149">Luminous fans and milky streaks of fire ;</l>
     <l n="150">Some like soft brushes of electric mist</l>
     <l n="151">Streaming from one bright point ; others that spread</l>
     <l n="152">And branch , like growing systems ; others discrete ,</l>
     <l n="153">Keen , ripe , with stars in clusters ; others drawn back</l>
     <l n="154">By central forces into one dense death ,</l>
     <l n="155">Thence to be kindled into fire , reborn ,</l>
     <l n="156">And scattered abroad once more in a delicate spray</l>
     <l n="157">Faint as the mist by one bright dewdrop breathed</l>
     <l n="158">At dawn , and yet a universe like our own ;</l>
     <l n="159">Each wisp a universe , a vast galaxy</l>
     <l n="160">Wide as our night of stars .</l>
     <l n="161">The Milky Way</l>
     <l n="162">In which our sun is drowned , to these would seem</l>
     <l n="163">Less than to us their faintest drift of haze ;</l>
     <l n="164">Yet we , who are borne on one dark grain of dust</l>
     <l n="165">Around one indistinguishable spark</l>
     <l n="166">Of star-mist , lost in one lost feather of light ,</l>
     <l n="167">Can by the strength of our own thought , ascend</l>
     <l n="168">Through universe after universe ; trace their growth</l>
     <l n="169">Through boundless time , their glory , their decay ;</l>
     <l n="170">And , on the invisible road of law , more firm</l>
     <l n="171">Than granite , range through all their length and breadth ,</l>
     <l n="172">Their height and depth , past , present and to come .</l>
     <l n="173">So , those who follow the great Work-master 's law</l>
     <l n="174">From small things up to great , may one day learn</l>
     <l n="175">The structure of the heavens , discern the whole</l>
     <l n="176">Within the part , as men through Love see God .</l>
     <l n="177">Oh , holy night , deep night of stars , whose peace</l>
     <l n="178">Descends upon the troubled mind like dew ,</l>
     <l n="179">Healing it with the sense of that pure reign</l>
     <l n="180">Of constant law , enduring through all change ;</l>
     <l n="181">Shall I not , one day , after faithful years ,</l>
     <l n="182">Find that thy heavens are built on music , too ,</l>
     <l n="183">And hear , once more , above thy throbbing worlds</l>
     <l n="184">This voice of all compassion , Comfort ye ,—</l>
     <l n="185">Yes — comfort ye , my people , saith your God ?</l>

     <l n="10">There , in the Octagon Chapel , with bared head</l>
     <l n="11">Grey , honoured for his father and himself ,</l>
     <l n="12">He touched the glimmering keyboard , touched the books</l>

     <l n="18">An hour or so ? ”</l>
     <l n="19">His hands explored the stops ;</l>

     <l n="21">His mind through many thoughts and memories ranged .</l>
     <l n="22">Picture on picture passed before him there</l>
     <l n="23">In living colours , painted on the gloom :</l>
     <l n="24">Not what the world acclaimed , the great work crowned ,</l>

     <l n="26">The years of infinite patience , hope , despair .</l>
     <l n="27">He saw the little house where all began ,</l>
     <l n="28">His father 's first resolve to explore the sky ,</l>
     <l n="29">His first defeat , when telescopes were found</l>
     <l n="30">Too costly for a music-master 's purse ;</l>

     <l n="33">A better than even the best that Newton made . ”</l>
     <l n="34">He saw his first rude telescope — a tube</l>
     <l n="35">Of pasteboard , with a lens at either end ;</l>
     <l n="36">And then ,— that arduous growth to size and power</l>
     <l n="37">With each new instrument , as his knowledge grew ;</l>
     <l n="38">And , to reward each growth , a deeper heaven .</l>
     <l n="39">He saw the good Aunt Caroline 's dismay</l>
     <l n="40">When her trim drawing-room , as by wizardry , turned</l>
     <l n="41">Into a workshop , where her brother 's hands</l>
     <l n="42">Cut , ground and burnished , hour on aching hour ,</l>

     <l n="46">Knowing that if he once removed his hands</l>
     <l n="47">The surface would be dimmed and must forego</l>
     <l n="48">Its heaven for ever , her quiet hands would raise</l>

     <l n="64">Gashing herself upon that buried hook ,</l>

     <l n="67">“ For any soldier ,</l>

     <l n="71">“ I am glad these nights were cloudy , and we lost</l>

     <l n="73">Sir John pulled out</l>
     <l n="74">Another stop . A little ironical march</l>

     <l n="76">He saw that first “ success ” ! Ay , call it so !</l>
     <l n="77">The royal command ,— the court desires to see</l>
     <l n="78">The planet Saturn and his marvellous rings</l>
     <l n="79">On Friday night . The skies , on Friday night ,</l>
     <l n="80">Were black with clouds . “ Canute me no Canutes , ”</l>
     <l n="81">Muttered their new magician , and unpacked</l>
     <l n="82">His telescope . “ You shall see what you can see . ”</l>
     <l n="83">He levelled it through a window ; and they saw</l>
     <l n="84">“ Wonderful ! Marvellous ! Glorious ! Eh , what , what ! ”</l>
     <l n="85">A planet of paper , with a paper ring ,</l>
     <l n="86">Lit by a lamp , in a hollow of Windsor Park ,</l>
     <l n="87">Among the ferns , where Herne the Hunter walks ,</l>
     <l n="88">And Falstaff found that fairies live on cheese .</l>
     <l n="89">Thus all were satisfied ; while , above the clouds —</l>

     <l n="91">The Titan planet , every minute , rolled</l>
     <l n="92">Three hundred leagues upon his awful way .</l>
     <l n="93">Then , through that night , the vox humanaspoke</l>
     <l n="94">With deeper longing than Lucretius knew</l>
     <l n="95">When , in his great third book , the somber chant</l>

     <l n="102">From dying hand to hand .</l>
     <l n="103">Close to his grave</l>

     <l n="152">Adams , the boy at Cambridge , making his vow</l>
     <l n="153">By that still lamp , alone in that deep night ,</l>

     <l n="172">Le Verrier in France ,</l>
     <l n="173">Adams in England , each of them unaware</l>

     <l n="180">They worked by faith in law alone . They knew</l>

     <l n="182">The law of Newton .</l>
     <l n="183">By the midnight lamp ,</l>

     <l n="191">Only the flash and tinsel of their day ,</l>
     <l n="192">Never the quiet runners with the torch .</l>
     <l n="193">Night after night they laboured . Line on line</l>
     <l n="194">Of intricate figures , moving all in law ,</l>
     <l n="195">They marshalled . Their long columns formed and marched</l>
     <l n="196">From battle to battle , and no sound was heard</l>
     <l n="197">Of victory or defeat . They marched through snows</l>
     <l n="198">Bleak as the drifts that broke Napoleon 's pride</l>
     <l n="199">And through a vaster desert . They drilled their hosts</l>
     <l n="200">With that divine precision of the mind</l>

     <l n="206">Brooding over his figures there alone</l>
     <l n="207">In Cambridge , Adams found them moving all</l>
     <l n="208">To one solution . To the unseeing eye</l>
     <l n="209">His long neat pages had no more to tell</l>

     <l n="216">And of so huge an orbit that its year</l>
     <l n="217">Wellnigh outlasts our nations . Though it moves</l>
     <l n="218">A thousand leagues an hour , it has not ranged</l>

     <l n="1">Once more upon the mountain 's lonely height</l>
     <l n="2">I woke , and round me heard the sea-like sound</l>

     <l n="4">Through the long canyons and precipitous gorges</l>
     <l n="5">Where coyotes moaned and eagles made their nest .</l>
     <l n="6">Once more , far , far below , I saw the lights</l>
     <l n="7">Of distant cities , at the mountain 's feet ,</l>
     <l n="8">Clustered like constellations .. .</l>
     <l n="9">Over me , like the dome of some strange shrine ,</l>

     <l n="11">And moving on its axis like a moon</l>

     <l n="16">Their monastery of thought .</l>
     <l n="17">A shadow neared me .</l>

     <l n="20">I wish that old Copernicus could see</l>

     <l n="22">Broke the false axle-trees of heaven , destroyed</l>
     <l n="23">All central certainty in the universe ,</l>
     <l n="24">And seemed to dwarf mankind , the spirit of man</l>
     <l n="25">Laid hold on law , that Jacob'shYpppHeNladder of light ,</l>
     <l n="26">And mounting , slowly , surely , step by step ,</l>

     <l n="30">Led Kepler to the music of his laws ,</l>

     <l n="39">In isolated measure , a centre of law ,</l>
     <l n="40">Amidst the whirl of universal chaos .</l>
     <l n="41">For law descends from law . Though all the spheres</l>
     <l n="42">Through all the abysmal depths of Space were blown</l>
     <l n="43">Like dust before a colder darker wind</l>

     <l n="49">Only to gather them up , as a shattered wave</l>
     <l n="50">Is gathered again into a rhythmic sea ,</l>
     <l n="51">Whose ebb and flow are but the pulse of Life ,</l>
     <l n="52">In its creative passion .</l>
     <l n="53">The records grow</l>
     <l n="54">Unceasingly , and each new grain of truth</l>
     <l n="55">Is packed , like radium , with whole worlds of light .</l>
     <l n="56">The eclipses timed in Babylon help us now</l>
     <l n="57">To clock that gradual quickening of the moon ,</l>
     <l n="58">Ten seconds in a century .</l>
     <l n="59">Who that wrote</l>
     <l n="60">On those clay tablets could foresee his gift</l>
     <l n="61">To future ages ; dreamed that the groping mind ,</l>
     <l n="62">Dowered with so brief a life , could ever range</l>
     <l n="63">With that divine precision through the abyss ?</l>
     <l n="64">Who , when that good Dutch spectacle-maker set</l>
     <l n="65">Two lenses in a tube , to read the time</l>
     <l n="66">Upon the distant clock-tower of his church ,</l>
     <l n="67">Could dream of this , our hundred-inch , that shows</l>
     <l n="68">The snow upon the polar caps of Mars</l>
     <l n="69">Whitening and darkening as the seasons change ?</l>
     <l n="70">Or who could dream when Galileo watched</l>
     <l n="71">His moons of Jupiter , that from their eclipses</l>
     <l n="72">And from that change in their appointed times ,</l>
     <l n="73">Now late , now early , as the watching earth</l>
     <l n="74">Farther or nearer on its orbit rolled ,</l>
     <l n="75">The immeasurable speed of light at last</l>
     <l n="76">Should be reduced to measure ?</l>
     <l n="77">Could Newton dream</l>
     <l n="78">When , through his prism , he broke the pure white shaft</l>
     <l n="79">Into that rainbow band , how men should gather</l>
     <l n="80">And disentangle ray by delicate ray</l>
     <l n="81">The colours of the stars ,— not only those</l>
     <l n="82">That burn in heaven , but those that long since perished ,</l>
     <l n="83">Those vanished suns that eyes can still behold ,</l>
     <l n="84">The strange lost stars whose light still reaches earth</l>
     <l n="85">Although they died ten thousand years ago .</l>
     <l n="86">Here , night by night , the innumerable heavens</l>
     <l n="87">Speak to an eye more sensitive than man 's ,</l>
     <l n="88">Write on the camera 's delicate retina</l>
     <l n="89">A thousand messages , lines of dark and bright</l>
     <l n="90">That speak of elements unknown on earth .</l>
     <l n="91">How shall men doubt , who thus can read the Book</l>
     <l n="92">Of Judgment , and transcend both Space and Time ,</l>
     <l n="93">Analyse worlds that long since passed away ,</l>
