     <l n="2">In the flowery land of Persia</l>
     <l n="3">Long ago , as poets tell ,</l>
     <l n="4">Where three rivers met together</l>
     <l n="5">Did a happy people dwell .</l>
     <l n="6">Never did these happy people</l>
     <l n="7">Suffer sickness , plague , or dearth ,</l>
     <l n="8">Living in a golden climate</l>
     <l n="9">In the fairest place on earth ,</l>
     <l n="10">Living thus thro ’ endless summers</l>
     <l n="11">And half-summers hardly colder ,</l>
     <l n="12">Growing , tho ’ they hardly guessed it ,</l>
     <l n="13">Very gradually older .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="14">I can very well imagine</l>
     <l n="15">These old Persian lords and ladies</l>
     <l n="16">Sitting in their pleasant gardens ,</l>
     <l n="17">Dreaming , dozing , where the shade is ;</l>
     <l n="18">Almond trees a mass of blossom ,</l>
     <l n="19">Roses , roses , red as wine ,</l>
     <l n="20">With the helmets of the tulips</l>
     <l n="21">Flaming in a martial line ,</l>
     <l n="22">While beside a marble basin ,</l>
     <l n="23">With a fountain gushing forth ,</l>
     <l n="24">Stands a red-legged crane , alighted</l>
     <l n="25">From the deserts of the North .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="26">So they lived these ancient people ,</l>
     <l n="27">With the happy harmless faces ,</l>
     <l n="28">Dreaming till the purple twilight</l>
     <l n="29">In their flowery garden-places ,</l>
     <l n="30">Finding every year the sunshine</l>
     <l n="31">And the wind a little colder ,</l>
     <l n="32">Growing , tho ’ they hardly guessed it ,</l>
     <l n="33">Very gradually older ,</l>
     <l n="34">Till at last they grew so frail</l>
     <l n="35">That to their gardens they were carried ,</l>
     <l n="36">Very feeble and exhausted ,</l>
     <l n="37">Weak as babes — But still they tarried ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="38">Lying till the purple twilight</l>
     <l n="39">Wrapped in wool but hardly warm ,</l>
     <l n="40">Wearing shawls of costliest texture</l>
     <l n="41">Lest the wind might do them harm ,</l>
     <l n="42">Feeling very faint sensations</l>
     <l n="43">Of delight in each old breast ,</l>
     <l n="44">Twittering with tiny voices</l>
     <l n="45">Like young swallows in a nest .</l>
     <l n="46">Then the young men spoke together</l>
     <l n="47">As they feasted in the taverns ,</l>
     <l n="48">“ It is time to take our Fathers ,</l>
     <l n="49">We must bear them to the Caverns . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="50">In a mountain were the Caverns ,</l>
     <l n="51">Fourteen leagues across the sand ,</l>
     <l n="52">Fourteen leagues across the desert</l>
     <l n="53">In a naked golden land .</l>
     <l n="54">Black and bold and bare the mountain</l>
     <l n="55">Modelled into many shapes ,</l>
     <l n="56">Cones and pyramids and pillars ,</l>
     <l n="57">Beetling cliffs and jutting capes .</l>
     <l n="58">And within it were the Caverns</l>
     <l n="59">Tunnelled into every part ,</l>
     <l n="60">Some by ancient Persian devils ,</l>
     <l n="61">Others by a modern art .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="62">Where the terraced lawns lay dreaming ,</l>
     <l n="63">Underneath a cedar-tree</l>
     <l n="64">Dozed an ancient , ancient person</l>
     <l n="65">Tiny as a child of three .</l>
     <l n="66">Every day a gobbling negro</l>
     <l n="67">To his place the old man carried ;</l>
     <l n="68">Very feeble and exhausted</l>
     <l n="69">Did he seem — but still he tarried .</l>
     <l n="70">Then Hasan , the young lord , murmured ,</l>
     <l n="71">As he feasted in the taverns ,</l>
     <l n="72">“ It is time to take my Father ,</l>
     <l n="73">I must bear him to the Caverns . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="74">So he took his long-maned pony ,</l>
     <l n="75">Her who wore the silver shoes ,</l>
     <l n="76">Galloped thro ’ the crowded highways</l>
     <l n="77">Like one with no time to lose .</l>
     <l n="78">Purpose in his warning outcry</l>
     <l n="79">( Was he not the next of kin ? )</l>
     <l n="80">Till he reached his palace gateway ,</l>
     <l n="81">Flung the rein and fled within ,</l>
     <l n="82">Chose with care a wicker basket</l>
     <l n="83">Very strong and deep and wide ,</l>
     <l n="84">Laying shawls of costliest texture</l>
     <l n="85">And an eider quilt inside .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="86">Underneath the spreading cedar ,</l>
     <l n="87">In an arbour newly built ,</l>
     <l n="88">Found Hasan his ancient person ,</l>
     <l n="89">Put him underneath the quilt ,</l>
     <l n="90">Mounted then his long-maned pony</l>
     <l n="91">With the basket on his arm ,</l>
     <l n="92">Carrying it very firmly</l>
     <l n="93">Lest his father might take harm .</l>
     <l n="94">Galloped thro ’ the crowded highway ,</l>
     <l n="95">Passing by the Street of Taverns ,</l>
     <l n="96">Fourteen leagues across the desert</l>
     <l n="97">Till he came unto the Caverns .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="98">Fastened then his long-maned pony</l>
     <l n="99">To a ring-post at the mouth</l>
     <l n="100">( Scores and scores of ring-posts were there</l>
     <l n="101">Where the Caverns faced the South )</l>
     <l n="102">Plunged within the long wide gallery</l>
     <l n="103">Tunnelled ‘ neath the rocky roof ,</l>
     <l n="104">With a lantern light exploring</l>
     <l n="105">All the dark which lay aloof ,</l>
     <l n="106">Treading swiftly , treading surely ,</l>
     <l n="107">With the basket on his arm ,</l>
     <l n="108">Carrying it very firmly</l>
     <l n="109">Lest his father might take harm .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="110">Till he came a byway unto</l>
     <l n="111">Fashioned from another way ,</l>
     <l n="112">And a niche seen at the summit</l>
     <l n="113">Of a guiding lantern ray .</l>
     <l n="114">Lifted then the basket gently ,</l>
     <l n="115">Poised , and placed it in the niche ,</l>
     <l n="116">Saying “ Farewell , ancient father ,</l>
     <l n="117">‘ Tis the custom ” ... after which</l>
     <l n="118">Bowed his head before his father</l>
     <l n="119">Thrice , and swiftly turned to go ,</l>
     <l n="120">Knowing that it was the custom ,</l>
     <l n="121">Thinking it was better so .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="122">Suddenly he heard a droning ,</l>
     <l n="123">Like a gnat 's small plaintive lay ,</l>
     <l n="124">Somewhere in the dark behind him</l>
     <l n="125">Where the “ Ancient Persons ” lay ,</l>
     <l n="126">Heard a little ghostly twitter</l>
     <l n="127">Like a voice addressing him ,</l>
     <l n="128">Turned and saw his father staring</l>
     <l n="129">Just above the basket rim ,</l>
     <l n="130">Staring at Hasan , his strong son ,</l>
     <l n="131">With his filmy red-rimmed eyes ,</l>
     <l n="132">“ What 's ado , Oh ! ancient father ? ”</l>
     <l n="133">Cried Hasan in great surprise .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="134">“ Son , ” replied the ancient person ,</l>
     <l n="135">“ Tho ’ a miser is disgraced ,</l>
     <l n="136">Even in a wealthy household</l>
     <l n="137">Monstrous is the crime of waste ,</l>
     <l n="138">Strong and shapely is the basket</l>
     <l n="139">Much hath held and more will take ;</l>
     <l n="140">If you leave it in the Caverns</l>
     <l n="141">Wo n't it be a great mistake ?</l>
     <l n="142">So , for once , let custom perish ....</l>
     <l n="143">Son , ‘ tis I , your father , ask it ,</l>
     <l n="144">Lift me out and lay me gently</l>
     <l n="145">On the rock and ... take our basket . ”</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="146">Oh ! the young lord 's wild amazement</l>
     <l n="147">As he heard that tiny hum ;</l>
     <l n="148">Turned the lantern light behind him</l>
     <l n="149">Stricken with amazement dumb .</l>
     <l n="150">Oh ! the young lord 's vast confusion</l>
     <l n="151">As its meaning gave a flicker —</l>
     <l n="152">Oh ! the mild iconoclastic</l>
     <l n="153">Staring o'er the edge of wicker .</l>
     <l n="154">Staring — staring — simply staring</l>
     <l n="155">With his filmy red-rimmed eyes —</l>
     <l n="156">Down Hasan his father lifted</l>
     <l n="157">Silent still in strange surmise .</l>

     <l n="2">The dream of Adeimantus</l>
     <l n="3">Who carved for a Grecian Prince</l>
     <l n="4">Statues of perfect marble ,</l>
     <l n="5">Fairer than all things since ,</l>
     <l n="6">Wonderful , white , and gracious</l>
     <l n="7">Like lotus flowers on a mere ,</l>
     <l n="8">Or phantoms born of the moonbeam ,</l>
     <l n="9">Beyond all praise but a tear .</l>
     <l n="10">The dream of Adeimantus</l>
     <l n="11">( As he lay upon his bed ) ,</l>
     <l n="12">Wonderful , white , and gracious ,</l>
     <l n="13">And this was the word it said .</l>
     <l n="14">“ Arise ! oh ! Adeimantus ,</l>
     <l n="15">The breath of the dawn blows chill ,</l>
     <l n="16">The stars begin to fade</l>
     <l n="17">Ere the first ray strikes the sill .</l>
     <l n="18">Arise ! oh ! Adeimantus</l>
     <l n="19">For here is work to your hand ,</l>
     <l n="20">If the fingers fashion the dream</l>
     <l n="21">As the soul can understand . ”</l>
     <l n="22">He rose from his troubled bed</l>
     <l n="23">Ere the dream had faded away ,</l>
     <l n="24">And he said , “ I will fashion the dream</l>
     <l n="25">As the potter fashions the clay . ”</l>
     <l n="26">He said in his great heart 's vanity ,</l>
     <l n="27">“ I will fashion a wondrous thing</l>
     <l n="28">To stand in a palace of onyx</l>
     <l n="29">And blind the eyes of a king . ”</l>
     <l n="30">He said in the pride of his soul</l>
     <l n="31">As the birds began to sing ,</l>
     <l n="32">“ I will surely take no rest</l>
     <l n="33">Till I fashion this wondrous thing .</l>
     <l n="34">I will swear an oath to eschew</l>
     <l n="35">The white wine and the red ,</l>
     <l n="36">To eat no delicate meats</l>
     <l n="37">Nor break the fair , white bread .</l>
     <l n="38">I will not walk in the city</l>
     <l n="39">But labour here alone</l>
     <l n="40">In the dew and the dusk and the flush</l>
     <l n="41">Till the vision smiles from the stone . ”</l>
     <l n="42">Six days he wrought at the marble ,</l>
     <l n="43">But cunning had left his hand ,</l>
     <l n="44">And his fingers would not fashion</l>
     <l n="45">What his soul could understand .</l>
     <l n="46">Six days he fasted and travailed ,</l>
     <l n="47">Hard was the watch to keep ,</l>
     <l n="48">So the chisel fell from his fingers</l>
     <l n="49">And he sank with a sob to sleep .</l>
     <l n="50">But a vision came to his slumber</l>
     <l n="51">Beautiful as before ,</l>
     <l n="52">Floating in with the moonbeam</l>
     <l n="53">Gliding over the floor .</l>
     <l n="54">It floated in with the moonbeam</l>
     <l n="55">And stood beside his bed ,</l>
     <l n="56">Wonderful , white , and gracious ,</l>
     <l n="57">And this was the word it said .</l>
     <l n="58">“ Courage , oh ! Adeimantus ,</l>
     <l n="59">I am the perfect thing</l>
     <l n="60">To stand in a shrine of jasper</l>
     <l n="61">And blind the eyes of a king .</l>
     <l n="62">I am the strange desire ,</l>
     <l n="63">The glory beyond the dream ,</l>
     <l n="64">The passion above the song ,</l>
     <l n="65">The spirit-light of the gleam .</l>
     <l n="66">I come to my best beloved ,</l>
     <l n="67">Not actual , from afar ,</l>
     <l n="68">Fairer than hope or thought ,</l>
     <l n="69">More beautiful than a star .</l>
     <l n="70">Courage , oh ! Adeimantus ,</l>
     <l n="71">Lay strength and strength to your soul .</l>
     <l n="72">You shall fashion surely a part</l>

     <l n="1">The Wind and the Hills .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="2">We will carry our ills</l>
     <l n="3">To a height of the hills ,</l>
     <l n="4">Lying down , lying still</l>
     <l n="5">In the lap of a hill .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="6">The wind blowing keen</l>
     <l n="7">Shall again make us clean ,</l>
     <l n="8">Both body and spirit ;</l>
     <l n="9">As it passes we shall hear it .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="10">The time is of thunder</l>
     <l n="11">And fields new turned under ,</l>
     <l n="12">Of budding and waking ;</l>
     <l n="13">Of thorn-blossom flaking .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="14">Of longing and questing ;</l>
     <l n="15">Of carol and nesting ;</l>
     <l n="16">Of white birds on the wing</l>
     <l n="17">Over seas blue with spring .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="18">But you read in the pages</l>
     <l n="19">Of the books of the sages ,</l>
     <l n="20">And save that dark curtain</l>
     <l n="21">They know nothing certain ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="22">Except that dark portal</l>
     <l n="23">Which waits all things mortal —</l>
     <l n="24">And conqueror or prophet</l>
     <l n="25">Comprehend no more of it .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="26">Yet the wind travels so</l>
     <l n="27">That it surely must know ;</l>
     <l n="28">It has gone the world round</l>
     <l n="29">Till it came to our ground .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="30">And the hills , which stood fast</l>
     <l n="31">Ere the first axe was cast</l>
     <l n="32">And have seen so much history ,</l>
     <l n="33">May have fathomed the mystery .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="34">But the hills on our borders</l>
     <l n="35">Are silent old warders ,</l>
     <l n="36">And the winds which rejoice</l>
     <l n="37">No articulate voice .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="38">Oh ! ye pure larger airs</l>
     <l n="39">Ye will scatter our cares —</l>
     <l n="40">Mighty bastions of ours ,</l>
     <l n="41">Uplift that which cowers ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="42">For behind your grave brows</l>
     <l n="43">Are a thousand strong “ Nows — ”</l>
     <l n="44">And the wind has a “ must ”</l>
     <l n="45">In its rude healthy gust .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="46">How it braces and rightens</l>
     <l n="47">That wind to make Titans !</l>
     <l n="48">Its strenuous wooing</l>
     <l n="49">Says , “ Up , lads , and doing . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="50">So leaving the high down</l>
     <l n="51">Like giants we stride down ;</l>
     <l n="52">While the valleys before us</l>
     <l n="53">Resound to our chorus .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="54">Having been each a seer</l>
     <l n="55">To whom all things were near ,</l>
     <l n="56">Not resenting or grieving</l>
     <l n="57">But simply believing .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="58">The Happy Ones .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="59">They awaited with head erect</l>
     <l n="60">Whatever fate could befall them ;</l>
     <l n="61">Tried but the good to recollect ,</l>
     <l n="62">Cried for the truth to call them .</l>
     <l n="63">To be loved by the children of other suns</l>
     <l n="64">And send a message to find them ,</l>
     <l n="65">This is the fate of the happiest ones</l>
     <l n="66">Tho ’ the mortar of life may grind them .</l>
     <l n="67">They were like swimmers breasting the waves</l>
     <l n="68">In the troughs of a stormy channel ,</l>
     <l n="69">They are silent now in their lonely graves ,</l>
     <l n="70">But the world has become the panel .</l>
     <l n="71">They wore the truth like a bridal dress</l>
     <l n="72">And sorrow like wedding apparel ,</l>
     <l n="73">Tho ’ the placid laughed at their foolishness</l>
     <l n="74">And the cynic sneered from his barrel .</l>
     <l n="75">Or like the wandering Ishmaelites ,</l>
     <l n="76">Who found no city to dwell in ,</l>
     <l n="77">Whose lonely hearts ached for pleasant sights ,</l>
     <l n="78">Whose graves were the places they fell in ,</l>
     <l n="79">Rock their pillow and sand their bed ,</l>
     <l n="80">As the sun of the desert paints them ;</l>
     <l n="81">The fierce kites screaming overhead ,</l>
     <l n="82">And the hands of all men against them .</l>
     <l n="83">But a word goes out and over the earth ,</l>
     <l n="84">From the silent burying-places ,</l>
     <l n="85">Like a gentle rain in a land of dearth ,</l>
     <l n="86">And lights up the tired faces .</l>
     <l n="87">It brings a roof and a sweet abode</l>
     <l n="88">To many a soul that is vagrant ;</l>
     <l n="89">Their names are blossoms along the road</l>
     <l n="90">And their lives are for ever fragrant .</l>
     <l n="91">We who sorrow are brothers of theirs ,</l>
     <l n="92">Because of their beautiful sorrows ,</l>
     <l n="93">Wheat will grow up among the tares ,</l>
     <l n="94">And young corn grow in the furrows .</l>

     <l n="96">Why do you prate to me</l>
     <l n="97">Of deeds unjust and just ,</l>
     <l n="98">Moved by a story of good</l>
     <l n="99">Or a monstrous tale of crimes —</l>
     <l n="100">Me that can have no loves</l>
     <l n="101">But star-eyed queens long dust ,</l>
     <l n="102">Me that can mourn no griefs</l>

     <l n="108">The barking god of the Nile .</l>
     <l n="109">Her temples were raised and builded ,</l>
     <l n="110">And crumbled again to the dust —</l>
     <l n="111">Her worships have been and vanished —</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="25">
     <l n="122">For that Thou givest my soul some strength</l>

     <l n="125">I bless Thy name and kiss my scars .</l>

     <l n="127">Know the decree that natures such as mine</l>

     <l n="129">Hyperion-souls which need no anodyne .</l>
     <l n="130">Once more , once more ye come , ye lovely shapes ,</l>
     <l n="131">Voicing the magic “ Ye are Gods , not Apes . ”</l>

     <l n="133">In memory only !— What that memory gave</l>
     <l n="134">Of our young day , so brief and yet so brave ,</l>
     <l n="135">Will lead us half reluctant to the grave .</l>
     <l n="136">Tho ’ it existed not — lived never — only came</l>
     <l n="137">From some vast depth of dateless woe and shame</l>
     <l n="138">Striving to give its high desire a name ,</l>
     <l n="139">The glory dies not ; leaves us tired and still ;</l>
