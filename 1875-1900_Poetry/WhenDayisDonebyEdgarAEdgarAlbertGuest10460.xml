       <l n="3">And come once more to the welcome gate</l>
       <l n="4">Where the roses nod and the children wait ,</l>
       <l n="5">I tell myself as I see them smile</l>

       <l n="10">And the kettle sings in the old-time way ,</l>
       <l n="11">I throw my coat on a near-by chair</l>
       <l n="12">And say farewell to my pack of care .</l>

     <p>I 've lived with my friends and I 've shared in their joys , known sorrow with all of its tears ; I have harvested much from my acres of life , though some say I 've squandered my years . For much that is fine has been mine to enjoy , and I think I have lived to my best , And I have no regret , as I 'm nearing the end , for the gold that I might have possessed .</p>

      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="2">Last night I stood in a tawdry place</l>
       <l n="3">And watched the ways of the human race .</l>
       <l n="4">I looked at a party of shrieking girls</l>
       <l n="5">Piled on a table that whirls and whirls ,</l>
       <l n="6">And saw them thrown in a tangled heap ,</l>
       <l n="7">Sprawling and squirming and several deep .</l>
       <l n="8">And unto the wife who was standing by ,</l>
       <l n="9">“ These are all angels to be , ” said I .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="10">I followed the ways of the merry throng</l>
       <l n="11">And heard the laughter and mirth and song .</l>
       <l n="12">Into a barrel which turned and swayed</l>
       <l n="13">Men and women a journey made ,</l>
       <l n="14">And tumbling together they seemed to be</l>
       <l n="15">Like so many porpoises out at sea —</l>
       <l n="16">Men and women who 'd worked all day ,</l>
       <l n="17">Eagerly seeking a chance to play .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="18">“ What do you make of it all ? ” she said .</l>

       <l n="20">And care is bitter and duty stern ,</l>
       <l n="21">And each must weep when it comes his turn .</l>
       <l n="22">And all grow weary and long for play ,</l>
       <l n="23">So here is laughter to end the day .</l>
       <l n="24">Foolish ? Oh , yes , it is that , ” said I ,</l>

       <l n="28">We often grow silly and seek a smile</l>
       <l n="29">In a thousand ways that are not worth while ;</l>
       <l n="30">Yet after the mirth and the jest are through ,</l>
       <l n="31">We shall all be judged by the deeds we do ,</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="2">We got to talking art one day , discussing in a general way</l>
       <l n="3">How some can match with brush and paint the glory of a tree ,</l>
       <l n="4">And some in stone can catch the things of which the dreamy poet sings ,</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="6">Old Blake had sat in silence there and let each one of us declare</l>

       <l n="8">And then said he : “ It seems to me that any man , whoe'er he be ,</l>

       <l n="10">“ He need not write the books men read to be an artist . No , indeed !</l>
       <l n="11">He need not work with paint and brush to show his love of art ;</l>
       <l n="12">Who does a kindly deed to-day and helps another on his way ,</l>
       <l n="13">Has painted beauty on a face and played the poet 's part .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="14">“ Though some of us cannot express our inmost thoughts of loveliness ,</l>
       <l n="15">We prove we love the beautiful by how we act and live ;</l>
       <l n="16">The poet singing of a tree no greater poet is than he</l>
       <l n="17">Who finds it in his heart some care unto a tree to give .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="18">“ Though he who works in marble stone the name of artist here may own ,</l>
       <l n="19">No less an artist is the man who guards his children well ;</l>
       <l n="20">‘ Tis art to love the fine and true ; by what we are and what we do</l>
       <l n="21">How much we love life 's nobler things to all the world we tell . ”</l>

     <p>Oh , I 've heard the call of the tall white pine , and heard the call of the running brook ; I 'm tired of the tasks which each day are mine ; I 'm weary of reading a printed book . I want to get out of the din and strife , the clang and clamor of turning wheel , And walk for a day where life is life , and the joys are true and the pictures real .</p>

     <p>Oh , if we were rich as the richest on earth and strong as the strongest that lives , Yet never we knew the delight and the charm of the smile which the other man gives , If kindness were never a part of ourselves , though we owned all the land we could see , And friendship meant nothing at all to us here , what a dreary old world it would be !</p>
     <p>Life is sweet just because of the friends we have made and the things which in common we share ; We want to live on not because of ourselves , but because of the people who care ; It 's giving and doing for somebody else — on that all life 's splendor depends , And the joy of this world , when you 've summed it all up , is found in the making of friends .</p>

       <l n="72">On Saturdays I never left to wander far away —</l>
       <l n="73">I hovered near the kitchen door on Mother 's baking day ;</l>
       <l n="74">The fragrant smell of cooking seemed to hold me in its grip ,</l>
       <l n="75">And naught cared I for other sports while there were sweets to sip ;</l>
       <l n="76">I little cared that all my chums had sought the brook to fish ;</l>
       <l n="77">I chose to wait that moment glad when I could scrape the dish .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="15">
       <l n="78">Full many a slice of apple I have lifted from a pie</l>
       <l n="79">Before the upper crust went on , escaping Mother 's eye ;</l>
       <l n="80">Full many a time my fingers small in artfulness have strayed</l>
       <l n="81">Into some sweet temptation rare which Mother 's hands had made ;</l>
       <l n="82">But eager-eyed and watery-mouthed , I craved the greater boon ,</l>
       <l n="83">When Mother let me clean the dish and lick the frosting spoon .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="16">
       <l n="84">The baking days of old are gone , our children cannot know</l>
       <l n="85">The glorious joys that childhood owned and loved so long ago .</l>
       <l n="86">New customs change the lives of all and in their heartless way</l>
       <l n="87">They 've robbed us of the glad event once known as baking day .</l>
       <l n="88">The stores provide our every need , yet many a time I wish</l>
       <l n="89">Our kids could know that bygone thrill and scrape the frosting dish .</l>

       <l n="5">The dirty work around this house an ’ clean up when he 's through ,</l>
       <l n="6">But since I 'm not , I 'm truly glad that I am strong an ’ stout ,</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="8">Then after supper Pa put on his overalls an ’ said</l>

       <l n="10">He started in to rattle an ’ to bang an ’ poke an ’ stir ,</l>
       <l n="11">An ’ the dust began a-climbin ’ up through every register</l>
       <l n="12">Till Ma said : “ Goodness gracious ; go an ’ shut those things up tight</l>
       <l n="13">Or we 'll all be suffocated an ’ the house will be a sight . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="14">Then he carted out the ashes in a basket an ’ a pail ,</l>
       <l n="15">An ’ from cellar door to alley he just left an ashy trail .</l>
       <l n="16">Then he pulled apart the chimney , an ’ ‘ twas full of something black ,</l>
       <l n="17">An ’ he skinned most all his knuckles when he tried to put it back .</l>
       <l n="18">We could hear him talkin ’ awful , an ’ Ma looked at us an ’ said :</l>
