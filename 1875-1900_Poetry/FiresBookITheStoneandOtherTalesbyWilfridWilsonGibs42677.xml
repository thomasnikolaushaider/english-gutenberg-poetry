    <epigraph>
     <p>BY THE SAME WRITER DAILY BREAD ( 1910 ) WOMENKIND ( 1912 ) TO GEORGE CLAUSEN A TRIBUTE Snug in my easy chair , I stirred the fire to flame . Fantastically fair , The flickering fancies came . Born of hearts desire : Amber woodland streaming ; Topaz islands dreaming ; Sunset-cities gleaming , Spire on burning spire ; Ruddy-windowed taverns ; Sunshine-spilling wines ; Crystal-lighted caverns Of Golconda 's mines ; Summers , unreturning ; Passion 's crater yearning ; Troy , the ever-burning ; Shelley 's lustral pyre ; Dragon-eyes , unsleeping ; Witches ’ cauldrons leaping ; Golden galleys sweeping Out from sea-walled Tyre : Fancies , fugitive and fair , Flashed with singing through the air ; Till , dazzled by the drowsy glare , I shut my eyes to heat and light ; And saw , in sudden night , Crouched in the dripping dark , With steaming shoulders stark , The man who hews the coal to feed my fire .</p>

    <head>THE STONE</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ And will you cut a stone for him ,</l>
     <l n="2">To set above his head ?</l>
     <l n="3">And will you cut a stone for him —</l>
     <l n="4">A stone for him ? ” she said .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">Three days before , a splintered rock</l>
     <l n="6">Had struck her lover dead —</l>
     <l n="7">Had struck him in the quarry dead ,</l>
     <l n="8">Where , careless of the warning call ,</l>
     <l n="9">He loitered , while the shot was fired —</l>
     <l n="10">A lively stripling , brave and tall ,</l>
     <l n="11">And sure of all his heart desired ...</l>
     <l n="12">A flash , a shock ,</l>
     <l n="13">A rumbling fall ...</l>
     <l n="14">And , broken ‘ neath the broken rock ,</l>
     <l n="15">A lifeless heap , with face of clay ,</l>
     <l n="16">And still as any stone he lay ,</l>
     <l n="17">With eyes that saw the end of all .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="18">I went to break the news to her :</l>
     <l n="19">And I could hear my own heart beat</l>
     <l n="20">With dread of what my lips might say</l>
     <l n="21">But , some poor fool had sped before ;</l>
     <l n="22">And , flinging wide her father 's door ,</l>
     <l n="23">Had blurted out the news to her ,</l>
     <l n="24">Had struck her lover dead for her ,</l>
     <l n="25">Had struck the girl 's heart dead in her ,</l>
     <l n="26">Had struck life , lifeless , at a word ,</l>
     <l n="27">And dropped it at her feet :</l>
     <l n="28">Then hurried on his witless way ,</l>
     <l n="29">Scarce knowing she had heard .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="30">And when I came , she stood , alone</l>
     <l n="31">A woman , turned to stone :</l>
     <l n="32">And , though no word at all she said ,</l>
     <l n="33">I knew that all was known .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="34">Because her heart was dead ,</l>
     <l n="35">She did not sigh nor moan ,</l>
     <l n="36">His mother wept :</l>
     <l n="37">She could not weep .</l>
     <l n="38">Her lover slept :</l>
     <l n="39">She could not sleep .</l>
     <l n="40">Three days , three nights ,</l>
     <l n="41">She did not stir :</l>
     <l n="42">Three days , three nights ,</l>
     <l n="43">Were one to her ,</l>
     <l n="44">Who never closed her eyes</l>
     <l n="45">From sunset to sunrise ,</l>
     <l n="46">From dawn to evenfall :</l>
     <l n="47">Her tearless , staring eyes ,</l>
     <l n="48">That , seeing naught , saw all .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="49">The fourth night when I came from work ,</l>
     <l n="50">I found her at my door .</l>
     <l n="51">“ And will you cut a stone for him ? ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="52">She said : and spoke no more :</l>
     <l n="53">But followed me , as I went in ,</l>
     <l n="54">And sank upon a chair ;</l>
     <l n="55">And fixed her grey eyes on my face ,</l>
     <l n="56">With still , unseeing stare .</l>
     <l n="57">And , as she waited patiently ,</l>
     <l n="58">I could not bear to feel</l>
     <l n="59">Those still , grey eyes that followed me ,</l>
     <l n="60">Those eyes that plucked the heart from me ,</l>
     <l n="61">Those eyes that sucked the breath from me</l>
     <l n="62">And curdled the warm blood in me ,</l>
     <l n="63">Those eyes that cut me to the bone ,</l>
     <l n="64">And pierced my marrow like cold steel .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="65">And so I rose , and sought a stone ;</l>
     <l n="66">And cut it , smooth and square :</l>
     <l n="67">And , as I worked , she sat and watched ,</l>
     <l n="68">Beside me , in her chair .</l>
     <l n="69">Night after night , by candlelight ,</l>
     <l n="70">I cut her lover 's name :</l>
     <l n="71">Night after night , so still and white ,</l>
     <l n="72">And like a ghost she came ;</l>
     <l n="73">And sat beside me , in her chair ;</l>
     <l n="74">And watched with eyes aflame .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="75">She eyed each stroke ;</l>
     <l n="76">And hardly stirred :</l>
     <l n="77">She never spoke</l>
     <l n="78">A single word :</l>
     <l n="79">And not a sound or murmur broke</l>
     <l n="80">The quiet , save the mallet-stroke .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="81">With still eyes ever on my hands ,</l>
     <l n="82">With eyes that seemed to burn my hands ,</l>
     <l n="83">My wincing , overwearied hands ,</l>
     <l n="84">She watched , with bloodless lips apart ,</l>
     <l n="85">And silent , indrawn breath :</l>
     <l n="86">And every stroke my chisel cut ,</l>
     <l n="87">Death cut still deeper in her heart :</l>
     <l n="88">The two of us were chiselling ,</l>
     <l n="89">Together , I and death .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="90">And when at length the job was done ,</l>
     <l n="91">And I had laid the mallet by ,</l>
     <l n="92">As if , at last , her peace were won ,</l>
     <l n="93">She breathed his name ; and , with a sigh ,</l>
     <l n="94">Passed slowly through the open door :</l>
     <l n="95">And never crossed my threshold more .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="96">Next night I laboured late , alone ,</l>
     <l n="97">To cut her name upon the stone .</l>
    </lg>
    <p>THE WIFE</p>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="98">That night , she dreamt that he had died ,</l>
     <l n="99">As they were sleeping , side by side :</l>
     <l n="100">And she awakened in affright ,</l>
     <l n="101">To think of him , so cold and white :</l>
     <l n="102">And , when she turned her eyes to him ,</l>
     <l n="103">The tears of dream had made them dim ;</l>
     <l n="104">And , for a while , she could not see</l>
     <l n="105">That he was sleeping quietly .</l>
     <l n="106">But , as she saw him lying there ,</l>
     <l n="107">The moonlight on his curly hair ,</l>
     <l n="108">With happy face and even breath ,</l>
     <l n="109">Although she thought no more of death ;</l>
     <l n="110">And it was very good to rest</l>
     <l n="111">Her trembling hand on his calm breast ,</l>
     <l n="112">And feel the warm and breathing life ;</l>
     <l n="113">And know that she was still his wife ;</l>
     <l n="114">Yet , in his bosom 's easy stir ,</l>
     <l n="115">She felt a something trouble her ;</l>
     <l n="116">And wept again , she knew not why ;</l>
     <l n="117">And thought it would be good to die —</l>
     <l n="118">To sink into the deep , sweet rest ,</l>
     <l n="119">Her hand upon his quiet breast .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="120">She slept : and when she woke again ,</l>
     <l n="121">A bird was at the window-pane ,</l>
     <l n="122">A wild-eyed bird , with wings of white</l>
     <l n="123">That fluttered in the cold moonlight ,</l>
     <l n="124">As though for very fear of night ;</l>
     <l n="125">And flapped the pane , as if afraid :</l>
     <l n="126">Yet , not a sound the white wings made .</l>
     <l n="127">Her eyes met those beseeching eyes ;</l>
     <l n="128">And then she felt she needs must rise ,</l>
     <l n="129">To let the poor , wild creature in</l>
     <l n="130">To find the rest it sought to win .</l>
     <l n="131">She rose ; and set the casement wide ;</l>
     <l n="132">And caught the murmur of the tide ;</l>
     <l n="133">And saw , afar , the mounded graves</l>
     <l n="134">About the church beside the waves :</l>
     <l n="135">The huddled headstones gleaming white</l>
     <l n="136">And ghostly in the cold moonlight .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="137">The bird flew straightway to the bed ;</l>
     <l n="138">And hovered o'er the husband 's head ,</l>
     <l n="139">And circled thrice above his head ,</l>
     <l n="140">Three times above his dreaming head :</l>
     <l n="141">And , as she watched it , flying round</l>
     <l n="142">She wondered that it made no sound ;</l>
     <l n="143">And , while she wondered , it was gone :</l>
     <l n="144">And cold and white , the moonlight shone</l>
     <l n="145">Upon her husband , sleeping there ;</l>
     <l n="146">And turned to silver his gold hair ;</l>
     <l n="147">And paled like death his ruddy face .</l>
     <l n="148">Then , creeping back into her place ,</l>
     <l n="149">She lay beside him in the bed :</l>
     <l n="150">But , if she closed her eyes , with dread</l>
     <l n="151">She saw that wild bird 's eyes that burned</l>
     <l n="152">Through her shut eyelids , though she turned</l>
     <l n="153">Her blessings over in her heart ,</l>
     <l n="154">That peace might come : and with a start ,</l>
     <l n="155">If she but drowsed , or dreamt of rest ,</l>
     <l n="156">She felt that wild beak in her breast .</l>
     <l n="157">So , wearying for the time to rise ,</l>
     <l n="158">She watched , till dawn was in the skies .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="159">Her husband woke : but not a word</l>
     <l n="160">She told him of the strange , white bird :</l>
     <l n="161">But , as at breakfast-time , she took</l>
     <l n="162">The pan of porridge from the crook ;</l>
     <l n="163">And all was ready to begin ;</l>
     <l n="164">A neighbour gossip hurried in ;</l>
     <l n="165">And told the news , that Phoebe Wright</l>
     <l n="166">Had died in childbirth in the night .</l>
     <l n="167">The husband neither spoke , nor stirred ,</l>
     <l n="168">But sat as one who , having heard ,</l>
     <l n="169">May never hearken to a word</l>
     <l n="170">From any living lips again ;</l>
     <l n="171">And , heedless of the tongues of men ,</l>
     <l n="172">Hears , in a silence , dread and deep ,</l>
     <l n="173">The dead folk talking in their sleep .</l>
     <l n="174">His porridge stood till it was cold :</l>
     <l n="175">And as he sat , his face grew old ;</l>
     <l n="176">And all his yellow hair turned white ,</l>
     <l n="177">As it had looked to her last night ,</l>
     <l n="178">When it was drenched with cold moonlight .</l>
     <l n="179">And she knew all : yet never said</l>
     <l n="180">A word to him about the dead ;</l>
     <l n="181">Or pestered him to take his meat :</l>
     <l n="182">But , sitting silent in her seat ,</l>
     <l n="183">She left him quiet with his heart</l>
     <l n="184">To thoughts in which she had no part ;</l>
     <l n="185">Until he rose to go about</l>
     <l n="186">His daily work ; and staggered out .</l>
     <l n="187">And all that day , her eyes were dim</l>
     <l n="188">That she had borne no child to him .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="189">Days passed : and then , one evening late ,</l>
     <l n="190">As she came by the churchyard-gate ,</l>
     <l n="191">She saw him , near the new-made grave :</l>
     <l n="192">And , with a lifted head and brave ,</l>
     <l n="193">She hurried home , lest he should know</l>
     <l n="194">That she had looked upon his woe .</l>
     <l n="195">And when they sat beside the fire ,</l>
     <l n="196">Although it seemed he could not tire</l>
     <l n="197">Of gazing on the glowing coal ,</l>
     <l n="198">And though a fire was in her soul ;</l>
     <l n="199">She sat beside him with a smile ,</l>
     <l n="200">Lest he should look on her , the while ,</l>
     <l n="201">And wonder what could make her sad</l>
     <l n="202">When all the world but him was glad .</l>
     <l n="203">But , not a word to her he said :</l>
     <l n="204">And silently they went to bed .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="205">She never closed her eyes that night :</l>
     <l n="206">And she was stirring , ere the light ;</l>
     <l n="207">And while her husband lay at rest ,</l>
     <l n="208">She left his side , and quickly dressed ;</l>
     <l n="209">And stole downstairs , as though in fear</l>
     <l n="210">That he should chance to wake , and hear .</l>
     <l n="211">And still the stars were burning bright ,</l>
     <l n="212">As she passed out into the night ;</l>
     <l n="213">And all the dewy air was sweet</l>
     <l n="214">With flowers that grew about her feet ,</l>
     <l n="215">Where he , for her , when they were wed ,</l>
     <l n="216">Had digged and sown a wallflower-bed :</l>
     <l n="217">And on the rich , deep , mellow scent</l>
     <l n="218">A gust of memories came and went ,</l>
     <l n="219">As , dreaming of those old glad hours ,</l>
     <l n="220">She stooped to pluck a bunch of flowers ,</l>
     <l n="221">To lay upon the flowerless grave</l>
     <l n="222">That held his heart beside the wave .</l>
     <l n="223">Though , like a troop of ghosts in white ,</l>
     <l n="224">The headstones watched in cold starlight ,</l>
     <l n="225">As , by the dead girl 's grave she knelt ,</l>
     <l n="226">No fear in her full heart she felt :</l>
     <l n="227">But hurried home , when she had laid</l>
     <l n="228">Her offering on the turf , afraid</l>
     <l n="229">That he should wake , and find her gone :</l>
     <l n="230">And still the stars in heaven shone ,</l>
     <l n="231">When into bed again she crept ,</l>
     <l n="232">And lay beside him , while he slept</l>
     <l n="233">And when day came , upon his hair ,</l>
     <l n="234">The warm light fell : and young and fair ,</l>
     <l n="235">He looked again to her kind eyes</l>
     <l n="236">That watched him till ‘ twas time to rise .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="19">
     <l n="237">And , every day , as he went by</l>
     <l n="238">The churchyard-gate with downcast eye ,</l>
     <l n="239">He saw fresh blooms upon the grave</l>
     <l n="240">That held his heart beside the wave :</l>
     <l n="241">And , wondering , he was glad to find</l>
     <l n="242">That any living soul was kind</l>
     <l n="243">To that dead girl who died the death</l>
     <l n="244">Of shame for his sake : and the breath</l>
     <l n="245">Of those fresh flowers to him was sweet ,</l>
     <l n="246">As he trudged home with laggard feet ,</l>
     <l n="247">Still wondering who could be her friend .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="20">
     <l n="248">He never knew , until the end ,</l>
     <l n="249">When , in the churchyard by the wave ,</l>
     <l n="250">He stood beside another grave :</l>
     <l n="251">And , as the priest 's last words were said ,</l>
     <l n="252">He turned , and lifting up his head ,</l>
     <l n="253">He saw the bunch of flowers was dead</l>
     <l n="254">Upon the dead girl 's grave ; and felt</l>
     <l n="255">The truth shoot through his heart , and melt</l>
     <l n="256">The frost of icy bitterness ,</l>
     <l n="257">And flood his heart with warm distress :</l>
     <l n="258">And , kneeling by his dead wife 's grave ,</l>
     <l n="259">To her , at last , her hour he gave .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="21">
     <l n="260">That night , she dreamt he , too , had died ,</l>

    <p>THE MACHINE</p>
    <lg type="stanza" n="22">
     <l n="262">Since Thursday he 'd been working overtime ,</l>
     <l n="263">With only three short hours for food and sleep ,</l>
     <l n="264">When no sleep came , because of the dull beat</l>
     <l n="265">Of his fagged brain ; and he could scarcely eat .</l>
     <l n="266">And now , on Saturday , when he was free ,</l>
     <l n="267">And all his fellows hurried home to tea ,</l>
     <l n="268">He was so dazed that he could hardly keep</l>
     <l n="269">His hands from going through the pantomime</l>
     <l n="270">Of keeping-even sheets in his machine —</l>
     <l n="271">The sleek machine that , day and night ,</l>
     <l n="272">Fed with paper , virgin white ,</l>
     <l n="273">Through those glaring , flaring hours</l>
     <l n="274">In the incandescent light ,</l>
     <l n="275">Printed children 's picture-books —</l>
     <l n="276">Red and yellow , blue and green ,</l>
     <l n="277">With sunny fields and running brooks ,</l>
     <l n="278">Ships at sea , and golden sands ,</l>
     <l n="279">Queer white towns in Eastern lands ,</l>
     <l n="280">Tossing palms on coral strands —</l>
     <l n="281">Until at times the clank and whirr and click ,</l>
     <l n="282">And shimmer of white paper turned him sick ;</l>
     <l n="283">And though at first the colours made him glad ,</l>
     <l n="284">They soon were dancing in his brain like mad ;</l>
     <l n="285">And kept on flaring through his burning head :</l>
     <l n="286">Now , in a flash , the workshop , flaming red ;</l>
     <l n="287">Now blazing green ; now staring blue ;</l>
     <l n="288">And then the yellow glow too well he knew :</l>
     <l n="289">Until the sleek machine , with roar and glare ,</l>
     <l n="290">Began to take him in a dazzling snare ;</l>
     <l n="291">When , fascinated , with a senseless stare ,</l>
     <l n="292">It drew him slowly towards it , till his hair</l>
     <l n="293">Was caught betwixt the rollers ; but his hand ,</l>
     <l n="294">Almost before his brain could understand ,</l>
     <l n="295">Had clutched the lever ; and the wheels were stopped</l>
     <l n="296">Just in the nick of time ; though now he dropped ,</l>
     <l n="297">Half-senseless on the littered workshop floor :</l>
     <l n="298">And he 'd lain dazed a minute there or more ,</l>
     <l n="299">When his machine-girl helped him to a seat .</l>
     <l n="300">But soon again he was upon his feet ,</l>
     <l n="301">And tending that unsatisfied machine ;</l>
     <l n="302">And printing pictures , red and blue and green ,</l>
     <l n="303">Until again the green and blue and red</l>
     <l n="304">Went jigging in a riot through his head ;</l>
     <l n="305">And , wildest of the raging rout ,</l>
     <l n="306">The blinding , screeching , racking yellow —</l>
     <l n="307">A crazy devil of a fellow —</l>
     <l n="308">O'er all the others seemed to shout .</l>
     <l n="309">For hands must not be idle when the year</l>
     <l n="310">Is getting through , and Christmas drawing near ,</l>
     <l n="311">With piles on piles of picture-books to print</l>
     <l n="312">For people who spend money without stint :</l>
     <l n="313">And , while they 're paying down their liberal gold ,</l>
     <l n="314">Guess little what is bought , and what is sold .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="23">
     <l n="315">But he , at last , was free till Monday , free</l>
     <l n="316">To sleep , to eat , to dream , to sulk , to walk ,</l>
     <l n="317">To laugh , to sing , to whistle , or to talk ...</l>
     <l n="318">If only , through his brain , unceasingly ,</l>
     <l n="319">The wheels would not keep whirring , while the smell —</l>
     <l n="320">The oily smell of thick and sticky glaze</l>
     <l n="321">Clung to his nostrils , till ‘ twas hard to tell</l>
     <l n="322">If he were really out in the fresh air ;</l>
     <l n="323">And still before his eyes , the blind , white glare ,</l>
     <l n="324">And then the colours dancing in his head ,</l>
     <l n="325">A maddening maze of yellow , blue and red .</l>
     <l n="326">So , on he wandered in a kind of daze ,</l>
     <l n="327">Too racked with sleeplessness to think of bed</l>
     <l n="328">Save as a hell , where you must toss and toss ,</l>
     <l n="329">With colours shooting in insane criss-cross</l>
     <l n="330">Before wide , prickling , gritty , sleepless eyes .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="24">
     <l n="331">But , as he walked along the darkening street ,</l>
     <l n="332">Too tired to rest , and far too spent to eat ,</l>
     <l n="333">The swish and patter of the passing feet ,</l>
     <l n="334">The living , human murmur , and keen cries ,</l>
     <l n="335">The deep , cool shadows of the coming night ,</l>
     <l n="336">About quick-kindling jets of clustered light ;</l>
     <l n="337">And the fresh breathing of the rain-washed air ,</l>
     <l n="338">Brought something of sweet healing to his mind ;</l>
     <l n="339">And , though he trailed along as if half-blind ,</l>
     <l n="340">Yet often on the pavement he would stop</l>
     <l n="341">To gaze at goods displayed within a shop ;</l>
     <l n="342">And wonder , in a dull and lifeless way ,</l>
     <l n="343">What they had cost , and who 'd the price to pay .</l>
     <l n="344">But those two kinds of shop which , as a boy ,</l>
     <l n="345">Had been to him a never-failing joy ,</l>
     <l n="346">The bookshop and the fruitshop , he passed by ,</l>
     <l n="347">As if their colours seared his wincing eye ;</l>
     <l n="348">For still he feared the yellow , blue and red</l>
     <l n="349">Would start that devils ’ dancing in his head .</l>
     <l n="350">And soon , through throngs of people , almost gay</l>
     <l n="351">To be let loose from work , he pushed his way ;</l>
     <l n="352">And ripples of their careless laughter stole</l>
     <l n="353">Like waves of cooling waters through his soul ,</l>
     <l n="354">While sometimes he would lift his aching eyes ,</l>
     <l n="355">And see a child 's face , flushed with proud surprise ,</l>
     <l n="356">As , gripping both its parents ’ hands quite tight ,</l>
     <l n="357">It found itself in fairylands of light ,</l>
     <l n="358">Walking with grown-up people through the night :</l>
     <l n="359">Then , turning , with a shudder he would see</l>
     <l n="360">Poor painted faces , leering frightfully ,</l>
     <l n="361">And so drop back from heaven again to hell .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="25">
     <l n="362">And then , somehow , though how he scarce could tell ,</l>
     <l n="363">He found that he was walking through the throng ,</l>
     <l n="364">Quite happy , with a young girl at his side —</l>
     <l n="365">A young girl apple-cheeked and eager-eyed ;</l>
     <l n="366">And her frank , friendly chatter seemed a song</l>
     <l n="367">To him , who ne'er till now had heard life sing .</l>
     <l n="368">And youth within him kindled quick and strong ,</l>
     <l n="369">As he drank in that careless chattering .</l>
     <l n="370">And now she told to him how she had come</l>
     <l n="371">From some far Northern Isle to earn her bread ;</l>
     <l n="372">And in a stuffy office all day long ,</l>
     <l n="373">In shiny ledgers , with a splitting head ,</l>
     <l n="374">She added dazzling figures till they danced ,</l>
     <l n="375">And tied themselves in wriggling knots , and pranced ,</l>
     <l n="376">And scrambled helter-skelter o'er the page :</l>
     <l n="377">And , though it seemed already quite an age</l>
     <l n="378">Since she had left her home , from end to end</l>
     <l n="379">Of this big town she had not any friend :</l>
     <l n="380">At times she almost dreaded she 'd go dumb ,</l>
     <l n="381">With not a soul to speak to ; for , at home</l>
     <l n="382">In her own Island , she knew everyone ...</l>
     <l n="383">No strangers there ! save when the tinkers came ,</l>
     <l n="384">With pots and pans aglinting in the sun —</l>
     <l n="385">You saw the tin far off , like glancing flame ,</l>
     <l n="386">As all about the Island they would roam ....</l>
     <l n="387">Then , of themselves at home , there were six brothers ,</l>
     <l n="388">Five sisters , with herself , besides the others —</l>
     <l n="389">Two homeless babes , whom , having lost their mothers ,</l>
     <l n="390">Her mother 'd taken in among her own ...</l>
     <l n="391">And she in all her life had hardly known</l>
     <l n="392">Her mother with no baby at her breast ...</l>
     <l n="393">She 'd always sing to hush them all to sleep ;</l>
     <l n="394">And sang , too , for the dancing , sang to keep</l>
     <l n="395">The feet in time and tune ; and still sang best ,</l>
     <l n="396">Clean best of all the singers of the Isle .</l>
     <l n="397">And as she talked of home , he saw her smile ,</l>
     <l n="398">With happy , far-off gaze ; and then as though</l>
     <l n="399">In wonder how she 'd come to chatter so</l>
     <l n="400">To this pale , grave-eyed boy , she paused , half shy ;</l>
     <l n="401">And then she laughed , with laughter clear and true ;</l>
     <l n="402">And looked into his eyes ; and he laughed too ,</l>
     <l n="403">And they were happy , hardly knowing why .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="26">
     <l n="404">And now he told her of his life , and how</l>
     <l n="405">He too had been nigh friendless , until now .</l>
     <l n="406">And soon he talked to her about his work ;</l>
     <l n="407">But , when he spoke of it , as with a jerk ,</l>
     <l n="408">The light dropped from his eyes . He seemed to slip</l>
     <l n="409">Once more in the machine 's relentless grip ;</l>
     <l n="410">And hear again the clank and whirr and click ;</l>
     <l n="411">And see the dancing colours and the glare ;</l>
     <l n="412">Until his dizzy brain again turned sick :</l>
     <l n="413">And seeing him look round with vacant air ,</l>
     <l n="414">Fierce pity cut her to the very quick ;</l>
     <l n="415">And as her eyes with keen distress were filled ,</l>
     <l n="416">She touched his hand ; and soon her kind touch stilled</l>
     <l n="417">The agony : and so , to bring him ease ,</l>
     <l n="418">She told more of that Isle in Northern seas ,</l>
     <l n="419">Where she was born , and of the folks at home :</l>
     <l n="420">And how , all night , you heard the wash of foam ...</l>
     <l n="421">Sometimes , on stormy nights , against the pane</l>
     <l n="422">The sousing spray would rattle just like rain ;</l>
     <l n="423">And oft the high-tides scoured the threshold clean ...</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="27">
     <l n="424">And , as she talked , he saw the sea-light glint</l>
     <l n="425">In her dark eyes : and then the sleek machine</l>
     <l n="426">Lost hold on him at last ; and ceased to print :</l>
     <l n="427">And in his eyes there sprang a kindred light ,</l>
     <l n="428">As , hand in hand , they wandered through the night .</l>

    <p>THE LODESTAR</p>
    <lg type="stanza" n="28">
     <l n="429">From hag to hag , o'er miles of quaking moss ,</l>
     <l n="430">Benighted , in an unknown countryside ,</l>
     <l n="431">Among gaunt hills , the stars my only guide ;</l>
     <l n="432">Bewildered by peat-waters , black and deep ,</l>
     <l n="433">Wherein the mocking stars swam ; spent for sleep ;</l>
     <l n="434">O'erhYpppHeNwearied by long trudging ; at a loss</l>
     <l n="435">Which way to turn for shelter from the night ;</l>
     <l n="436">I struggled on , until , my head grown light</l>
     <l n="437">From utter weariness , I almost sank</l>
     <l n="438">To rest among the tussocks , soft and dank ,</l>
     <l n="439">Drowsing , half-dazed , and murmuring : it were best</l>
     <l n="440">To stray no further : but , to lie at rest ,</l>
     <l n="441">Beneath the cold , white stars , for evermore :</l>
     <l n="442">When , suddenly , I came across</l>
     <l n="443">A runnel oozing from the moss ;</l>
     <l n="444">And knew that , if I followed where it led ,</l>
     <l n="445">‘ Twould bring me to a valley , in the end ,</l>
     <l n="446">Where there 'd be houses , and , perhaps , a bed .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="29">
     <l n="447">And so , the little runnel was my friend ;</l>
     <l n="448">And as I walked beside its path , at first</l>
     <l n="449">It kept a friendly silence ; then it burst</l>
     <l n="450">Into a friendly singing , as it rambled ,</l>
     <l n="451">Among big boulders , down a craggy steep ,</l>
     <l n="452">‘ Mid bracken , nigh breast-deep ,</l>
     <l n="453">Through which I scrambled ,</l>
     <l n="454">Half-blind and numb for sleep ,</l>
     <l n="455">Until it seemed that I could strive no more :</l>
     <l n="456">When , startled by a startled sheep ,</l>
     <l n="457">Looking down , I saw a track —</l>
     <l n="458">A stony trackway , dimly white ,</l>
     <l n="459">Disappearing in the night ,</l>
     <l n="460">Across a waste of heather , burnt and black .</l>
     <l n="461">And so , I took it , mumbling o'er and o'er ,</l>
     <l n="462">In witlessness of weariness ,</l>
     <l n="463">And featherheaded foolishness :</l>
     <l n="464">A track must lead , at sometime , to a door .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="30">
     <l n="465">And , trudging to this senseless tune ,</l>
     <l n="466">That kept on drumming in my head ,</l>
     <l n="467">I followed where the pathway led ;</l>
     <l n="468">But , all too soon ,</l>
     <l n="469">It left the ling , and nigh was lost</l>
     <l n="470">Among the bent that glimmered grey</l>
     <l n="471">About my sore-bewildered way :</l>
     <l n="472">But when , at length , it crossed</l>
     <l n="473">A brawling burn , I saw , afar ,</l>
     <l n="474">A cottage window light —</l>
     <l n="475">A star , but no cold , heavenly star —</l>
     <l n="476">A warm red star of welcome in the night .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="31">
     <l n="477">Far off , it burned upon the black hillside ,</l>
     <l n="478">Sole star of earth in all that waste so wide :</l>
     <l n="479">A little human lantern in the night ,</l>
     <l n="480">Yet , more to me than all the bright</l>
     <l n="481">Unfriendly stars of heaven , so cold and white .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="32">
     <l n="482">And , as it dimly shone ,</l>
     <l n="483">Though towards it I could only go</l>
     <l n="484">With stumbling step and slow ,</l>
     <l n="485">It quickened in my heart a kindred glow ;</l>
     <l n="486">And seemed to draw me on</l>
     <l n="487">That last rough mile or so ,</l>
     <l n="488">Now seen , now hidden , when the track</l>
     <l n="489">Dipped down into a slack ,</l>
     <l n="490">And all the earth again was black :</l>
     <l n="491">And from the unseen fern ,</l>
     <l n="492">Grey ghost of all bewildered things ,</l>
     <l n="493">An owl brushed by me on unrustling wings ,</l>
     <l n="494">And gave me quite a turn ,</l>
     <l n="495">And sent a shiver through my hair .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="33">
     <l n="496">Then , again , more fair</l>
     <l n="497">Flashed the friendly light ,</l>
     <l n="498">Beckoning through the night ,</l>
     <l n="499">A golden , glowing square ,</l>
     <l n="500">Growing big and clearer ,</l>
     <l n="501">As I drew slowly nearer ,</l>
     <l n="502">With eager , stumbling feet ;</l>
     <l n="503">And snuffed the homely reek of peat :</l>
     <l n="504">And saw , above me , lone and high ,</l>
     <l n="505">A cottage , dark against the sky —</l>
     <l n="506">A candle shining on the window-sill .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="34">
     <l n="507">With thankful heart , I climbed the hill ;</l>
     <l n="508">And stood , at last , before</l>
     <l n="509">The dark and unknown door ,</l>
     <l n="510">Wondering if food and shelter lay behind ,</l>
     <l n="511">And what the welcome I should find ,</l>
     <l n="512">Whether kindly , or unkind :</l>
     <l n="513">But I had scarcely knocked , to learn my fate ,</l>
     <l n="514">When the latch lifted , and the door swung wide</l>
     <l n="515">On creaking hinges ; and I saw , inside ,</l>
     <l n="516">A frail old woman , very worn and white ,</l>
     <l n="517">Her body all atremble in the light ,</l>
     <l n="518">Who gazed with strange , still eyes into the night ,</l>
     <l n="519">As though she did not see me , but looked straight</l>
     <l n="520">Beyond me , to some unforgotten past :</l>
     <l n="521">And I was startled when she said at last ,</l>
     <l n="522">With strange , still voice : “ You 're welcome , though you 're late . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="35">
     <l n="523">And then , an old man , nodding in a chair ,</l>
     <l n="524">Beside the fire , awoke with sleepy stare ;</l>
     <l n="525">And rose in haste ; and led her to a seat ,</l>
     <l n="526">Beside the cosy hearth of glowing peat ;</l>
     <l n="527">And muttered to me , as he took her hand :</l>
     <l n="528">“ It 's queer , it 's queer , that she , to-night , should stand ,</l>
     <l n="529">Who has not stood alone for fifteen year .</l>
     <l n="530">Though I heard nothing , she was quick to hear .</l>
     <l n="531">I must have dozed ; but she has been awake ,</l>
     <l n="532">And listening for your footstep since daybreak :</l>
     <l n="533">For she was certain you would come to-day ;</l>
     <l n="534">Aye , she was sure , for all that I could say :</l>
     <l n="535">Talk as I might , she would not go to bed ,</l>
     <l n="536">Till you should come . Your supper has been spread</l>
     <l n="537">This long while : you 'll be ready for your meat . ”</l>
     <l n="538">With that he beckoned me to take a seat</l>
     <l n="539">Before the table , lifting from the crook</l>
     <l n="540">The singing kettle ; while , with far-off look ,</l>
     <l n="541">As though she neither saw nor heard ,</l>
     <l n="542">His wife sat gazing at the glowing peat .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="36">
     <l n="543">So , wondering sorely , I sat down to eat ;</l>
     <l n="544">And yet she neither spoke , nor stirred ;</l>
     <l n="545">But in her high-backed chair sat bolt-upright ,</l>
     <l n="546">With still grey eyes ; and tumbled hair , as white</l>
     <l n="547">As fairy-cotton , straggling o'er her brow ,</l>
     <l n="548">And hung in wisps about her wasted cheek .</l>
     <l n="549">But , when I 'd finished , and drew near the fire ,</l>
     <l n="550">She suddenly turned round to speak ,</l>
     <l n="551">Her old eyes kindling with a tense desire .</l>
     <l n="552">Her words came tremblingly : “ You 'll tell me now</l>
     <l n="553">What news you bring of him , my son ? ” Amazed ,</l>
     <l n="554">I met that searching and love-famished look :</l>
     <l n="555">And then the old man , seeing I was dazed ,</l>
     <l n="556">Made shift to swing aside the kettle crook ;</l>
     <l n="557">And muttered in my ear :</l>
     <l n="558">“ John Netherton , his name : ” and as I gazed</l>
     <l n="559">Into the peat that broke in clear blue flame ,</l>
     <l n="560">Remembrance flashed upon me with the name ;</l>
     <l n="561">And I slipped back in memory twenty year —</l>
     <l n="562">Back to the fo'c ' sle of a villainous boat ;</l>
     <l n="563">And once again in that hot hell I lay ,</l>
     <l n="564">Watching the smoky lantern duck and sway ,</l>
     <l n="565">As though in steamy stench it kept afloat ...</l>
     <l n="566">The fiery fangs of fever at my throat ;</l>
     <l n="567">And my poor broken arm , ill-set ,</l>
     <l n="568">A bar of white-hot iron at my side :</l>
     <l n="569">And , as I lay , with staring eyes pricked wide ,</l>
     <l n="570">Throughout eternities of agony ,</l>
     <l n="571">I saw a big , black shadow stoop o'er me ;</l>
     <l n="572">And felt a cool hand touch my brow , and wet</l>
     <l n="573">My cracking lips : and sank in healing sleep :</l>
     <l n="574">And when I rose from that unfathomed deep ,</l>
     <l n="575">I saw the youngest of that rascal crew</l>
     <l n="576">Beside my bunk ; and heard his name ; and knew</l>
     <l n="577">‘ Twas he who 'd brought me ease : but , soon , ashore ,</l>
     <l n="578">We parted ; and I never saw him more ;</l>
     <l n="579">Though , some while after , in another place ,</l>
     <l n="580">I heard he 'd perished in a drunken brawl ...</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="37">
     <l n="581">And now the old man touched me , to recall</l>
     <l n="582">My wandering thoughts ; and breathed again the name</l>
     <l n="583">And I looked up into the mother 's face</l>
     <l n="584">That burned before me with grey eyes aflame .</l>
     <l n="585">And so I told her how I 'd met her son ;</l>
     <l n="586">And of the kindly things that he had done .</l>
     <l n="587">And as I spoke her quivering spirit drank</l>
     <l n="588">The news that it had thirsted for so long ;</l>
     <l n="589">And for a flashing moment gay and strong</l>
     <l n="590">Life flamed in her old eyes , then slowly sank .</l>
     <l n="591">“ And he was happy when you saw him last ? ”</l>
     <l n="592">She asked : and I was glad to answer , “ Yes . ”</l>
     <l n="593">Then all sat dreaming without stir or sound ,</l>
     <l n="594">As gradually she sank into the past ,</l>
     <l n="595">With eyes that looked beyond all happiness ,</l>
     <l n="596">Beyond all earthly trouble and distress ,</l>
     <l n="597">Into some other world than ours . The thread</l>
     <l n="598">That long had held the straining life earthbound</l>
     <l n="599">Was loosed at last : her eyes grew dark : her head</l>
     <l n="600">Drooped slowly on her breast ; and she was dead .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="38">
     <l n="601">The old man at her side spoke not a word ,</l>
     <l n="602">As we arose , and bore her to the bed ;</l>
     <l n="603">And laid her on the clean , white quilt at rest</l>
     <l n="604">With calm hands folded on her quiet breast .</l>
     <l n="605">And , hour by hour , he hardly even stirred ,</l>
     <l n="606">Crouching beside me in the ingle-seat ;</l>
     <l n="607">And staring , staring at the still red glow :</l>
     <l n="608">But , only when the fire was burning low ,</l>
     <l n="609">He rose to bring fresh peat ;</l>
     <l n="610">And muttered with dull voice and slow :</l>
     <l n="611">“ This fire has ne'er burned out through all these years —</l>
     <l n="612">Not since the hearthstone first was set —</l>
     <l n="613">And that is nigh two hundred year ago .</l>
     <l n="614">My father 's father built this house ; and I ...</l>
     <l n="615">I thought my son ... ” and then he gave a sigh ;</l>
     <l n="616">And as he stooped , his wizened cheek was wet</l>
     <l n="617">With slowly-trickling tears .</l>
     <l n="618">And now he hearkened , while an owl 's keen cry</l>
     <l n="619">Sang through the silence , as it fluttered nigh</l>
     <l n="620">The cottage-window , dazzled by the light ,</l>
     <l n="621">Then back , with fainter hootings , into night .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="39">
     <l n="622">But , when the fresh peats broke into a blaze ,</l>
     <l n="623">He watched it with a steady , dry-eyed gaze ;</l>
     <l n="624">And spoke once more : “ And he , dead , too !</l>
     <l n="625">You did not tell her ; but I knew ... I knew ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="40">
     <l n="626">And now came all the tale of their distress :</l>
     <l n="627">Their only son , in wanton waywardness ,</l>
     <l n="628">Had left them , nearly thirty year ago ;</l>
     <l n="629">And they had never had a word from him</l>
     <l n="630">In all that time ... the reckless blow</l>
     <l n="631">Of his unkindness struck his mother low ...</l>
     <l n="632">Her hair , as ruddy as the fern</l>
     <l n="633">In late September by a moorland burn ,</l>
     <l n="634">Had shrivelled rimy-white</l>
     <l n="635">In one short summer 's night :</l>
     <l n="636">And they had looked , and looked for his return ...</l>
     <l n="637">His mother set for him at every meal ,</l>
     <l n="638">And kept his bed well-aired ... the knife and fork</l>
     <l n="639">I 'd used were John 's ... but , as all hope grew dim ,</l>
     <l n="640">She sickened , dwindling feebler every day :</l>
     <l n="641">Though , when it seemed that she must pass away ,</l>
     <l n="642">She grew more confident that , ere she passed ,</l>
     <l n="643">A stranger would bring news to her , at last ,</l>
     <l n="644">Of her lost son . “ And when I woke in bed</l>
     <l n="645">Beside her , as the dawn was burning red ,</l>
     <l n="646">She turned to me , with sleepless eyes , and said :</l>
     <l n="647">‘ The news will come , to-day . ’ ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="41">
     <l n="648">He spoke no more : and silent in my seat ,</l>
     <l n="649">With burning eyes upon the burning peat ,</l>
     <l n="650">I pondered on this strangest of strange things</l>
     <l n="651">That had befallen in my vagrant life :</l>
     <l n="652">And how , at last , my idle wanderings</l>
     <l n="653">Had brought me to this old man and his wife .</l>
     <l n="654">And as I brooded o'er the blaze ,</l>
     <l n="655">I thought with awe of that steadfast desire</l>
     <l n="656">Which , unto me unknown ,</l>
     <l n="657">Had drawn me through long years , by such strange ways ,</l>
     <l n="658">From that dark fo'c ' sle to this cottage-fire .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="42">
     <l n="659">And now , at last , quite spent , I dropped asleep :</l>
     <l n="660">And slumbered long and deep :</l>
     <l n="661">And when I waked , the peats were smouldering white</l>
     <l n="662">Upon the white hearthstone :</l>
     <l n="663">And over heath and bent dawn kindled bright</l>
     <l n="664">Beyond dark ridges in a rosy fleece :</l>
     <l n="665">While from the little window morning light</l>
     <l n="666">Fell on her face , made holy with the peace</l>
     <l n="667">That passeth understanding ; and was shed</l>
     <l n="668">In tender beams upon the low-bowed head</l>
     <l n="669">Of that old man , forlorn beside the bed .</l>
    </lg>
    <p>THE SHOP</p>
    <lg type="stanza" n="43">
     <l n="670">Tin-tinkle-tinkle-tinkle , went the bell ,</l>
     <l n="671">As I pushed in ; and , once again , the smell</l>
     <l n="672">Of groceries , and news-sheets freshly-printed ,</l>
     <l n="673">That always greeted me when I looked in</l>
     <l n="674">To buy my evening-paper : but , to-night ,</l>
     <l n="675">I wondered not to see the well-known face ,</l>
     <l n="676">With kind , brown eyes , and ever-friendly smile ,</l>
     <l n="677">Behind the counter ; and to find the place</l>
     <l n="678">Deserted at this hour , and not a light</l>
     <l n="679">In either window . Waiting there , a while ,</l>
     <l n="680">Though wondering at what change these changes hinted ,</l>
     <l n="681">I yet was grateful for the quiet gloom —</l>
     <l n="682">Lit only by a gleam from the back-room ,</l>
     <l n="683">And , here and there , a glint of glass and tin —</l>
     <l n="684">So pleasant , after all the flare and din</l>
     <l n="685">And hubbub of the foundry : and my eyes ,</l>
     <l n="686">Still tingling from the smoke , were glad to rest</l>
     <l n="687">Upon the ordered shelves , so neatly dressed</l>
     <l n="688">That , even in the dusk , they seemed to tell</l>
     <l n="689">No little of the hand that kept them clean ,</l>
     <l n="690">And of the head that sorted things so well</l>
     <l n="691">That naught of waste or worry could be seen ,</l>
     <l n="692">And kept all sweet with ever-fresh supplies .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="44">
     <l n="693">And , as I thought upon her quiet way ,</l>
     <l n="694">Wondering what could have got her , that she 'd left</l>
     <l n="695">The shop , unlit , untended , and bereft</l>
     <l n="696">Of her kind presence , overhead I heard</l>
     <l n="697">A tiptoe creak , as though somebody stirred ,</l>
     <l n="698">With careful step , across the upper floor :</l>
     <l n="699">Then all was silent , till the back-room door</l>
     <l n="700">Swung open ; and her husband hurried in .</l>
     <l n="701">He feared he 'd kept me , waiting in the dark ;</l>
     <l n="702">And he was sorry : but his wife who served</l>
     <l n="703">The customers at night-time usually —</l>
     <l n="704">While he made up the ledger after tea ,</l>
     <l n="705">Was busy , when I ... Well , to tell the truth ,</l>
     <l n="706">They were in trouble , for their little son</l>
     <l n="707">Had come in ill from school ... the doctor said</l>
     <l n="708">Pneumonia ... they 'd been putting him to bed :</l>
     <l n="709">Perhaps , I 'd heard them , moving overhead ,</l>
     <l n="710">For boards would creak , and creak , for all your care .</l>
     <l n="711">They hoped the best ; for he was young ; and youth</l>
     <l n="712">Could come through much ; and all that could be done</l>
     <l n="713">Would be ... then he stood , listening , quite unnerved ,</l>
     <l n="714">As though he heard a footstep on the stair ,</l>
     <l n="715">Though I heard nothing : but at my remark</l>
     <l n="716">About the fog and sleet , he turned ,</l>
     <l n="717">And answered quickly , as there burned</l>
     <l n="718">In his brown eyes an eager flame :</l>
     <l n="719">The raw and damp were much to blame :</l>
     <l n="720">If but his son might breathe West-country air !</l>
     <l n="721">A certain Cornish village he could name</l>
     <l n="722">Was just the place ; if they could send him there ,</l>
     <l n="723">And only for a week , he 'd come back stronger ...</l>
     <l n="724">And then , again , he listened : and I took</l>
     <l n="725">My paper , and went , afraid to keep him longer ;</l>
     <l n="726">And left him standing with that haggard look .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="45">
     <l n="727">Next night , as I pushed in , there was no tinkle :</l>
     <l n="728">And , glancing up , I saw the bell was gone ;</l>
     <l n="729">Although , in either window , the gas shone ;</l>
     <l n="730">And I was greeted by a cheery twinkle</l>
     <l n="731">Of burnished tins and bottles from the shelves :</l>
     <l n="732">And now , I saw the father busy there</l>
     <l n="733">Behind the counter , cutting with a string</l>
     <l n="734">A bar of soap up for a customer ,</l>
     <l n="735">With weary eyes , and jerky , harassed air ,</l>
     <l n="736">As if his mind were hardly on the task :</l>
     <l n="737">And when ‘ twas done , and parcelled up for her ,</l>
     <l n="738">And she had gone ; he turned to me , and said :</l>
     <l n="739">He thought that folks might cut their soap themselves .</l>
     <l n="740">‘ Twas nothing much ... but any little thing ,</l>
     <l n="741">At such a time ... And , having little doubt</l>
     <l n="742">The boy was worse , I did not like to ask ;</l>
     <l n="743">So picked my paper up , and hurried out .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="46">
     <l n="744">And , all next day , amid the glare and clang</l>
     <l n="745">And clatter of the workshop , his words rang ;</l>
     <l n="746">And kept on ringing , in my head a-ring ;</l>
     <l n="747">But any little thing ... at such a time ...</l>
     <l n="748">And kept on chiming to the anvils ’ chime :</l>
     <l n="749">But any little thing ... at such a time ...</l>
     <l n="750">And they were hissed and sputtered in the sizzle</l>
     <l n="751">Of water on hot iron : little thing ...</l>
     <l n="752">At such a time : and , when I left , at last ,</l>
     <l n="753">The smoke and steam ; and walked through the cold drizzle ,</l>
     <l n="754">The lumbering of the ‘ buses as they passed</l>
     <l n="755">Seemed full of it ; and to the passing feet ,</l>
     <l n="756">The words kept patter , patter , with dull beat .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="47">
     <l n="757">I almost feared to turn into their street ,</l>
     <l n="758">Lest I should find the blinds down in the shop :</l>
     <l n="759">And , more than once , I 'd half-a-mind to stop ,</l>
     <l n="760">And buy my paper from the yelling boys ,</l>
     <l n="761">Who darted all about with such a noise</l>
     <l n="762">That I half-wondered , in a foolish way ,</l>
     <l n="763">How they could shriek so , knowing that the sound</l>
     <l n="764">Must worry children , lying ill in bed ...</l>
     <l n="765">Then , thinking even they must earn their bread ,</l>
     <l n="766">As I earned mine , and scarce as noisily !</l>
     <l n="767">I wandered on ; and very soon I found</l>
     <l n="768">I 'd followed where my thoughts had been all day .</l>
     <l n="769">And stood before the shop , relieved to see</l>
     <l n="770">The gases burning , and no window-blind</l>
     <l n="771">Of blank foreboding . With an easier mind ,</l>
     <l n="772">I entered slowly ; and was glad to find</l>
     <l n="773">The father by the counter , ‘ waiting me ,</l>
     <l n="774">With paper ready and a cheery face .</l>
     <l n="775">Yes ! yes ! the boy was better ... took the turn ,</l>
     <l n="776">Last night , just after I had left the place .</l>
     <l n="777">He feared that he 'd been short and cross last night .</l>
     <l n="778">But , when a little child was suffering ,</l>
     <l n="779">It worried you ... and any little thing ,</l>
     <l n="780">At such a moment , made you cut up rough :</l>
     <l n="781">Though , now that he was going on all right ...</l>
     <l n="782">Well , he 'd have patience , now , to be polite !</l>
     <l n="783">And , soon as ever he was well enough ,</l>
     <l n="784">The boy should go to Cornwall for a change —</l>
     <l n="785">Should go to his own home ; for he , himself ,</l>
     <l n="786">Was Cornish , born and bred , his wife as well :</l>
     <l n="787">And still his parents lived in the old place —</l>
     <l n="788">A little place , as snug as snug could be ...</l>
     <l n="789">Where apple-blossom dipped into the sea ...</l>
     <l n="790">Perhaps , to strangers ’ ears , that sounded strange —</l>
     <l n="791">But not to any Cornishman who knew</l>
     <l n="792">How sea and land ran up into each other ;</l>
     <l n="793">And how , all round each wide , blue estuary ,</l>
     <l n="794">The flowers were blooming to the waters ’ edge :</l>
     <l n="795">You 'd come on blue-bells like a sea of blue ...</l>
     <l n="796">But they would not be out for some while yet ...</l>
     <l n="797">‘ Twould be primroses , blowing everywhere ,</l>
     <l n="798">Primroses , and primroses , and primroses ...</l>
     <l n="799">You 'd never half-know what primroses were ,</l>
     <l n="800">Unless you 'd seen them growing in the West ;</l>
     <l n="801">But , having seen , would never more forget .</l>
     <l n="802">Why , every bank , and every lane and hedge</l>
     <l n="803">Was just one blaze of yellow ; and the smell ,</l>
     <l n="804">When the sun shone upon them , after wet ...</l>
     <l n="805">And his eyes sparkled , as he turned to sell</l>
     <l n="806">A penny loaf and half-an-ounce of tea</l>
     <l n="807">To a poor child , who waited patiently ,</l>
     <l n="808">With hacking cough that tore her hollow chest :</l>
     <l n="809">And , as she went out , clutching tight the change ,</l>
     <l n="810">He muttered to himself : It 's strange , it 's strange</l>
     <l n="811">That little ones should suffer so .... The light</l>
     <l n="812">Had left his eyes : but , when he turned to me ,</l>
     <l n="813">I saw a flame leap in them , hot and bright .</l>
     <l n="814">I 'd like to take them all , he said , to-night !</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="48">
     <l n="815">And , in the workshop , all through the next day ,</l>
     <l n="816">The anvils had another tune to play ...</l>
     <l n="817">Primroses , and primroses , and primroses :</l>
     <l n="818">The bellows puffing out : It 's strange , it 's strange</l>
     <l n="819">That little ones should suffer so ...</l>
     <l n="820">And now , my hammer , at a blow :</l>
     <l n="821">I 'd like to take them all , to-night !</l>
     <l n="822">And , in the clouds of steam , and white-hot glow ,</l>
     <l n="823">I seemed to see primroses everywhere ,</l>
     <l n="824">Primroses , and primroses , and primroses .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="49">
     <l n="825">And , each night after that , I heard the boy</l>
     <l n="826">Was mending quickly ; and would soon be well :</l>
     <l n="827">Till one night I was startled by the bell :</l>
     <l n="828">Tin-tinkle-tinkle-tinkle , loud and clear ;</l>
     <l n="829">And tried to hush it , lest the lad should hear .</l>
     <l n="830">But , when the father saw me clutch the thing ,</l>
     <l n="831">He said , the boy had missed it yesterday ;</l>
     <l n="832">And wondered why he could not hear it ring ;</l>
     <l n="833">And wanted it ; and had to have his way .</l>
     <l n="834">And then , with brown eyes burning with deep joy ,</l>
     <l n="835">He told me , that his son was going West —</l>
     <l n="836">Was going home ... the doctor thought , next week ,</l>
     <l n="837">He 'd be quite well enough : the way was long ;</l>
     <l n="838">But trains were quick ; and he would soon be there</l>
     <l n="839">And on the journey he 'd have every care ,</l>
     <l n="840">His mother being with him ... it was best ,</l>
     <l n="841">That she should go : for he would find it strange ,</l>
     <l n="842">The little chap , at first ... she needed change ...</l>
     <l n="843">And , when they 'd had a whiff of Western air !</l>
     <l n="844">‘ Twould cost a deal ; and there was naught to spare</l>
     <l n="845">But , what was money , if you had n't health :</l>
     <l n="846">And , what more could you buy , if you 'd the wealth ...</l>
     <l n="847">Yes ! ‘ twould be lonely for himself , and rough ;</l>
     <l n="848">Though , on the whole , he 'd manage well enough :</l>
     <l n="849">He 'd have a lot to do : and there was naught</l>
     <l n="850">Like work to keep folk cheerful : when the hand</l>
     <l n="851">Was busy , you had little time for thought ;</l>
     <l n="852">And thinking was the mischief ... and ‘ twas grand</l>
     <l n="853">To know that they 'd be happy . Then the bell</l>
     <l n="854">Went tinkle-tinkle ; and he turned to sell .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="50">
     <l n="855">One night he greeted me with face that shone ,</l>
     <l n="856">Although the eyes were wistful ; they were gone —</l>
     <l n="857">Had gone this morning , he was glad to say :</l>
     <l n="858">And , though ‘ twas sore work , setting them away ,</l>
     <l n="859">Still , ‘ twas the best for them ... and they would be</l>
     <l n="860">Already in the cottage by the sea ...</l>
     <l n="861">He spoke no more of them ; but turned his head ;</l>
     <l n="862">And said he wondered if the price of bread ...</l>
     <l n="863">And , as I went again into the night ,</l>
     <l n="864">I saw his eyes were glistening in the light .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="51">
     <l n="865">And , two nights after that , he 'd got a letter :</l>
     <l n="866">And all was well : the boy was keeping better ;</l>
     <l n="867">And was as happy as a child could be ,</l>
     <l n="868">All day with the primroses and the sea ,</l>
     <l n="869">And pigs ! Of all the wonders of the West ,</l>
     <l n="870">His mother wrote , he liked the pigs the best .</l>
     <l n="871">And now the father laughed until the tears</l>
     <l n="872">Were in his eyes , and chuckled : Aye ! he knew !</l>
     <l n="873">Had he not been a boy there once , himself ?</l>
     <l n="874">He 'd liked pigs , too , when he was his son 's years .</l>
     <l n="875">And then , he reached a half-loaf from the shelf ;</l>
     <l n="876">And twisted up a farthing 's worth of tea ,</l>
     <l n="877">And farthing 's worth of sugar , for the child ,</l>
     <l n="878">The same poor child who waited patiently ,</l>
     <l n="879">Still shaken by a hacking , racking cough .</l>

     <l n="880">And , all next day , the anvils rang with jigs :</l>

     <l n="882">Until it seemed the workshop had gone wild ,</l>
     <l n="883">And it would echo , echo , ever after</l>
     <l n="884">The tune the hammers tinkled on and off ,</l>
     <l n="885">A silly tune of primroses and pigs ...</l>
     <l n="886">Of all the wonders of the West</l>
     <l n="887">He liked the pigs , he liked the pigs the best !</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="53">
     <l n="888">Next night , as I went in , I caught</l>
     <l n="889">A strange , fresh smell . The postman had just brought</l>
     <l n="890">A precious box from Cornwall , and the shop</l>
     <l n="891">Was lit with primroses , that lay atop</l>
     <l n="892">A Cornish pasty , and a pot of cream :</l>
     <l n="893">And , as , with gentle hands , the father lifted</l>
     <l n="894">The flowers his little son had plucked for him ,</l>
     <l n="895">He stood a moment in a far-off dream ,</l>
     <l n="896">As though in glad remembrances he drifted</l>
     <l n="897">On Western seas : and , as his eyes grew dim ,</l>
     <l n="898">He stooped , and buried them in deep , sweet bloom</l>
     <l n="899">Till , hearing , once again , the poor child 's cough ,</l>
     <l n="900">He served her hurriedly , and sent her off ,</l>
     <l n="901">Quite happily , with thin hands filled with flowers .</l>
     <l n="902">And , as I followed to the street , the gloom</l>
     <l n="903">Was starred with primroses ; and many hours</l>
     <l n="904">The strange , shy flickering surprise</l>
     <l n="905">Of that child 's keen , enchanted eyes</l>
     <l n="906">Lit up my heart , and brightened my dull room .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="54">
     <l n="907">Then , many nights the foundry kept me late</l>
     <l n="908">With overtime ; and I was much too tired</l>
     <l n="909">To go round by the shop ; but made for bed</l>
     <l n="910">As straight as I could go : until one night</l>
     <l n="911">We 'd left off earlier , though ‘ twas after eight ,</l>
     <l n="912">I thought I 'd like some news about the boy .</l>
     <l n="913">I found the shop untended ; and the bell</l>
     <l n="914">Tin-tinkle-tinkle-tinkled all in vain .</l>
     <l n="915">And then I saw , through the half-curtained pane ,</l>
     <l n="916">The back-room was a very blaze of joy :</l>
     <l n="917">And knew the mother and son had come safe back .</l>
     <l n="918">And , as I slipped away , now all was well ,</l>
     <l n="919">I heard the boy shriek out , in shrill delight :</l>
     <l n="920">“ And , father , all the little pigs were black ! ”</l>

     <l n="929">The Winter day broke blue and bright ,</l>

     <l n="937">Had never shot a spark</l>
     <l n="938">Of comfort through the dark ,</l>
     <l n="939">So ghostly in the cold sunlight</l>
     <l n="940">It seemed , that we were struck the while</l>

     <l n="946">For guillemot or shag —</l>
     <l n="947">Like seamen sitting bolt-upright</l>
     <l n="948">Upon a half-tide reef :</l>

     <l n="951">And still too mazed to speak ,</l>
     <l n="952">We landed ; and made fast the boat ;</l>

     <l n="959">And so must climb for evermore .</l>
     <l n="960">Yet , all too soon , we reached the door —</l>

     <l n="966">Familiar as our daily breath ,</l>

     <l n="1">All morning they had quarrelled , as they worked ,</l>
     <l n="2">A little off their fellows , in the pit :</l>
     <l n="3">Dick growled at Robert ; Robert said Dick shirked :</l>
     <l n="4">And when the roof , dropt more than they had reckoned ,</l>
     <l n="5">Began to crack and split ,</l>
     <l n="6">Though both rushed like a shot to set</l>
     <l n="7">The pit-props in their places ,</l>
     <l n="8">Each said the other was to blame ,</l>
     <l n="9">When , all secure , with flushed and grimy faces ,</l>
     <l n="10">They faced each other for a second .</l>
     <l n="11">All morning they had quarrelled : yet ,</l>
     <l n="12">Neither had breathed her name .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="13">Again they turned to work :</l>
     <l n="14">And in the dusty murk</l>
     <l n="15">Of that black gallery</l>
     <l n="16">Which ran out three miles underneath the sea ,</l>
     <l n="17">There was no sound at all ,</l>
     <l n="18">Save whispering creak of roof and wall .</l>
     <l n="19">And crack of coal , and tap of pick ,</l>
     <l n="20">And now and then a rattling fall :</l>
     <l n="21">While Robert worked on steadily , but Dick</l>
     <l n="22">In fits and starts , with teeth clenched tight ,</l>
     <l n="23">And dark eyes flashing in his lamp 's dull light .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="24">And when he paused , nigh spent , to wipe the sweat</l>
     <l n="25">From off his dripping brow : and Robert turned</l>
     <l n="26">To fling some idle jibe at him , the spark</l>
     <l n="27">Of anger , smouldering in him , flared and burned —</l>
     <l n="28">Though all his body quivered , wringing-wet —</l>
     <l n="29">Till that black hole</l>
     <l n="30">To him blazed red ,</l>
     <l n="31">As if the very coal</l>
     <l n="32">Had kindled underfoot and overhead :</l>
     <l n="33">Then , gripping tight his pick ,</l>
     <l n="34">He rushed upon his brother :</l>
     <l n="35">But Robert , turning quick ,</l>
     <l n="36">Leapt up , and now they faced each other .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="37">They faced each other : Dick with arm upraised ,</l>
     <l n="38">In act to strike , and murder in his eyes ....</l>
     <l n="39">When , suddenly , with noise of thunder ,</l>
     <l n="40">The earth shook round them , rumbling o'er and under ;</l>
     <l n="41">And Dick saw Robert , lying at his feet :</l>
     <l n="42">As , close behind , the gallery crashed in :</l>
     <l n="43">And almost at his heel , earth gaped asunder .</l>
     <l n="44">By black disaster dazed ,</l>
     <l n="45">His wrath died ; and he dropped the pick ;</l>
     <l n="46">And staggered , dizzily and terror-sick .</l>
     <l n="47">But , when the dust and din</l>
     <l n="48">Had settled to a stillness , dread as death :</l>
     <l n="49">And he once more could draw his breath ;</l>
     <l n="50">He gave a little joyful shout</l>
     <l n="51">To find the lamps had not gone out .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="52">And on his knees he fell</l>
     <l n="53">Beside his brother , buried in black dust :</l>
     <l n="54">And , full of tense misgiving ,</l>
     <l n="55">He lifted him , and thrust</l>
     <l n="56">A knee beneath his head ; and cleared</l>
     <l n="57">The dust from mouth and nose : but could not tell</l>
     <l n="58">Awhile if he were dead or living .</l>
     <l n="59">Too fearful to know what he feared ,</l>
     <l n="60">He fumbled at the open shirt ,</l>
     <l n="61">And felt till he could feel the heart ,</l>
     <l n="62">Still beating with a feeble beat :</l>
     <l n="63">And then he saw the closed lids part ,</l>
     <l n="64">And saw the nostrils quiver ;</l>
     <l n="65">And knew his brother lived , though sorely hurt .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="66">Again he staggered to his feet ,</l>
     <l n="67">And fetched his water-can , and wet</l>
     <l n="68">The ashy lips , and bathed the brow ,</l>
     <l n="69">Until his brother sat up with a shiver ,</l>
     <l n="70">And gazed before him with a senseless stare</l>
     <l n="71">And dull eyes strangely set .</l>
     <l n="72">Too well Dick knew that now</l>
     <l n="73">They must not linger there ,</l>
     <l n="74">Cut off from all their mates , to be o'ertaken</l>
     <l n="75">In less than no time by the deadly damp ,</l>
     <l n="76">So , picking up his lamp ,</l>
     <l n="77">He made his brother rise ;</l>
     <l n="78">Then took him by the arm ,</l>
     <l n="79">And shook him , till he 'd shaken</l>
     <l n="80">An inkling of the danger and alarm</l>
     <l n="81">Into those dull , still eyes :</l>
     <l n="82">Then dragged him , and half-carried him , in haste ,</l>
     <l n="83">To reach the airway , where ‘ twould still be sweet</l>
     <l n="84">When all the gallery was foul with gas :</l>
     <l n="85">But , soon as they had reached it , they were faced</l>
     <l n="86">By a big fall of roof they could not pass ;</l>
     <l n="87">And found themselves cut off from all retreat ,</l>
     <l n="88">On every hand , by that black shining wall ;</l>
     <l n="89">With naught to do but sit and wait</l>
     <l n="90">Till rescue came , if rescue came at all ,</l>
     <l n="91">And did not come too late .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="92">And , in the fresher airway , light came back</l>
     <l n="93">To Robert 's eyes , although he never spoke :</l>
     <l n="94">And not a sound the deathly quiet broke ,</l>
     <l n="95">As they sat staring at that wall of black —</l>
     <l n="96">As , in the glimmer of the dusky lamp ,</l>
     <l n="97">They sat and wondered , wondered if the damp —</l>
     <l n="98">The stealthy after-damp that creeping , creeping ,</l>
     <l n="99">Takes strong lads by the throat , and drops them sleeping ,</l>
     <l n="100">To wake no more for any woman 's weeping —</l>
     <l n="101">Would steal upon them , ere the rescue came ....</l>
     <l n="102">And if the rescuers would find them sitting ,</l>
     <l n="103">Would find them sitting cold ....</l>
     <l n="104">Then , as they sat and wondered , like a flame</l>
     <l n="105">One thought burned up both hearts :</l>
     <l n="106">Still , neither breathed her name .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="107">And now their thoughts dropped back into the pit ,</l>
     <l n="108">And through the league-long gallery went flitting</l>
     <l n="109">With speed no fall could hold :</l>
     <l n="110">They wondered how their mates had fared :</l>
     <l n="111">If they 'd been struck stone-dead ,</l>
     <l n="112">Or if they shared</l>
     <l n="113">Like fate with them , or reached the shaft ,</l>
     <l n="114">Unhurt , and only scared ,</l>
     <l n="115">Before disaster overtook them :</l>
     <l n="116">And then , although their courage ne'er forsook them ,</l>
     <l n="117">They wondered once again if they must sit</l>
     <l n="118">Awaiting death ... but knowing well</l>
     <l n="119">That even for a while to dwell</l>
     <l n="120">On such like thoughts will drive a strong man daft :</l>
     <l n="121">They shook themselves until their thoughts ran free</l>
     <l n="122">Along the drift , and clambered in the cage ;</l>
     <l n="123">And in a trice were shooting up the shaft :</l>
     <l n="124">But when their thoughts had come to the pithead ,</l>
     <l n="125">And found the fearful people gathered there ,</l>
     <l n="126">Beneath the noonday sun ,</l>
     <l n="127">Bright-eyed with terror , blinded by despair ,</l>
     <l n="128">Dick rose , and with his chalk wrote on the wall ,</l>
     <l n="129">This message for their folk :</l>
     <l n="130">“ We can n't get any further , 12 , noonday ” —</l>
     <l n="131">And signed both names ; and , when he 'd done ,</l>
     <l n="132">Though neither of them spoke ,</l>
     <l n="133">They both seemed easier in a way ,</l>
     <l n="134">Now that they 'd left a word ,</l>
     <l n="135">Though nothing but a scrawl .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="136">And silent still they sat ,</l>
     <l n="137">And never stirred :</l>
     <l n="138">And Dick 's thoughts dwelt on this and that :</l>
     <l n="139">How , far above their heads , upon the sea</l>
     <l n="140">The sun was shining merrily ,</l>
     <l n="141">And in its golden glancing</l>
     <l n="142">The windy waves were dancing :</l>
     <l n="143">And how he 'd slipt that morning on his way :</l>
     <l n="144">And how on Friday , when he drew his pay ,</l>
     <l n="145">He 'd buy a blanket for his whippet , Nell ;</l>
     <l n="146">He felt dead certain she would win the race ,</l>
     <l n="147">On Saturday ... though you could never tell ,</l>
     <l n="148">There were such odds against her ... but his face</l>
     <l n="149">Lit up as though , even now , he saw her run ,</l>
     <l n="150">A little slip of lightning , in the sun :</l>
     <l n="151">While Robert 's thoughts were ever on the match</l>
     <l n="152">His team was booked to play on Saturday ;</l>
     <l n="153">He placed the field , and settled who should play</l>
     <l n="154">The centre-forward ; for he had a doubt</l>
     <l n="155">Will Burn was scarcely up to form , although ...</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="156">Just then , the lamp went slowly out .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="157">Still , neither stirred ,</l>
     <l n="158">Nor spoke a word ;</l>
     <l n="159">Though either 's breath came quickly , with a catch .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="160">And now again one thought</l>
     <l n="161">Set both their hearts afire</l>
     <l n="162">In one fierce flame</l>
     <l n="163">Of quick desire :</l>
     <l n="164">Though neither breathed her name .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="165">Then Dick stretched out his hand ; and caught</l>
     <l n="166">His brother 's arm ; and whispered in his ear :</l>
     <l n="167">“ Bob , lad , there 's naught to fear ...</l>
     <l n="168">And , when we 're out , lad , you and she shall wed . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="169">Bob gripped Dick 's hand ; and then no more was said ,</l>
     <l n="170">As , slowly , all about them rose</l>
     <l n="171">The deadly after-damp ; but close</l>
     <l n="172">They sat together , hand in hand .</l>
     <l n="173">Then their minds wandered ; and Dick seemed to stand</l>
     <l n="174">And shout till he was hoarse</l>
     <l n="175">To speed his winning whippet down the course ...</l>
     <l n="176">And Robert , with the ball</l>
     <l n="177">Secure within his oxter charged ahead</l>
     <l n="178">Straight for the goal , and none could hold ,</l>
     <l n="179">Though many tried a fall .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="180">Then dreaming they were lucky boys in bed ,</l>
     <l n="181">Once more , and lying snugly by each other :</l>
     <l n="182">Dick , with his arms clasped tight about his brother ,</l>
     <l n="183">Whispered with failing breath</l>
     <l n="184">Into the ear of death :</l>
     <l n="185">“ Come , Robert , cuddle closer , lad , it 's cold . ”</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">When they put out that Summer eve</l>
     <l n="10">To sink the lobster-pots at sea ,</l>
     <l n="11">The sun was crimson in the sky ;</l>
     <l n="12">And not a breath was in the sky ,</l>
     <l n="13">The brooding , thunder-laden sky ,</l>

     <l n="28">The son rowed on , and nothing feared :</l>

     <l n="41">So merrily , he rowed , and sang ;</l>

     <l n="50">So very quiet in the stern ;</l>
     <l n="51">He laughed , and asked him if he slept ;</l>

     <l n="1">“ Good-night ! ” he sang out cheerily :</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">And I was gay that night to be</l>
     <l n="4">Once more in my clean countryside ,</l>
     <l n="5">Among the windy hills and wide .</l>
     <l n="6">Six days of city slush and mud ,</l>
     <l n="7">Of hooting horn , and spattering wheel ,</l>
     <l n="8">Made me rejoice again to feel</l>
     <l n="9">The tingling frost that fires the blood ,</l>
     <l n="10">And sets life burning keen and bright ;</l>
     <l n="11">And down the ringing road to stride</l>
     <l n="12">The eager swinging stride that braces</l>
     <l n="13">The straining thews from hip to heel :</l>
     <l n="14">To breathe again the wind that sweeps</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="17">And I was glad again to hear</l>
     <l n="18">The old man 's greeting of good cheer :</l>
     <l n="19">For every night for many a year</l>
     <l n="20">At that same corner we had met ,</l>
     <l n="21">Summer and Winter , dry and wet :</l>
     <l n="22">And though I never once had heard</l>
     <l n="23">The old man speak another word ,</l>
     <l n="24">His cheery greeting at the bend</l>
     <l n="25">Seemed like the welcome of a friend .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="26">But , as we neared to-night , somehow ,</l>
     <l n="27">I felt that he would stop and speak :</l>
     <l n="28">Though he went by : and when I turned ,</l>
     <l n="29">I saw him standing in the road ,</l>
     <l n="30">And looking back , with hand to brow ,</l>
     <l n="31">As if to shade old eyes , grown weak</l>
     <l n="32">Awaiting the long sleep they 'd earned :</l>
     <l n="33">Though , as again towards him I strode ,</l>
     <l n="34">A friendly light within them burned .</l>
     <l n="35">And then , as I drew nigh , he spoke</l>
     <l n="36">With shaking head , and voice that broke :</l>
     <l n="37">“ I 've missed you these last nights , ” he said</l>
     <l n="38">“ And I have not so many now</l>
     <l n="39">That I can miss friends easily ...</l>
     <l n="40">Aye : friends grow scarce , as you grow old :</l>
     <l n="41">And roads are rough : and winds are cold :</l>
     <l n="42">And when you feel you 're losing hold ,</l>
     <l n="43">Life does not go too merrily . ”</l>
     <l n="44">And then he stood with nodding head ,</l>
     <l n="45">And spoke no more . And so I told</l>
     <l n="46">How I had been , six days and nights ,</l>
     <l n="47">Exiled from pleasant sounds and sights .</l>
     <l n="48">And now , as though my voice had stirred</l>
     <l n="49">His heart to speech , he told right out ,</l>
     <l n="50">With quickening eye and quavering word ,</l>
     <l n="51">The things I care to hear about ,</l>
     <l n="52">The little things that make up life :</l>
     <l n="53">How he 'd been lonesome , since his wife</l>
     <l n="54">Had died , some thirty year ago :</l>
     <l n="55">And how he trudged three mile or so</l>
     <l n="56">To reach the farmstead where he worked ,</l>
     <l n="57">And three mile back to his own door ...</l>
     <l n="58">For he dwelt outby on the moor :</l>
     <l n="59">And every day the distance irked</l>
     <l n="60">More sorely still his poor , old bones ;</l>
     <l n="61">And all the road seemed strewn with stones</l>
     <l n="62">To trip you up , when you were old —</l>
     <l n="63">When you were old , and friends were few :</l>
     <l n="64">How , since the farmstead had been sold ,</l>
     <l n="65">The master and the men were new ,</l>
     <l n="66">All save himself ; and they were young ;</l>
     <l n="67">And Mistress had a raspy tongue :</l>
     <l n="68">So , often , he would hardly speak</l>
     <l n="69">A friendly word from week to week</l>
     <l n="70">With any soul . Old friends had died ,</l>
     <l n="71">Or else had quit the countryside :</l>
     <l n="72">And , since his wife was taken , he</l>
     <l n="73">Had lived alone , this thirty year :</l>
     <l n="74">And there were few who cared to hear</l>
     <l n="75">An old man 's jabber ... and too long</l>
     <l n="76">He 'd kept me , standing in the cold ,</l>
     <l n="77">With his long tongue , and such a song</l>
     <l n="78">About himself ! And I would be ...</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="79">I put my arm through his ; and turned</l>

     <l n="81">And once again that warm light burned</l>
     <l n="82">In those old eyes , so weak and dim :</l>
     <l n="83">While , with thin , piping voice , he told</l>
     <l n="84">How much it meant to him each night</l>
     <l n="85">To change a kindly word with me :</l>
     <l n="86">To think that he 'd at least one friend</l>

     <l n="88">Then , as we walked , he said no more :</l>

     <l n="94">A chirrup where some partridge stirred ,</l>

     <l n="97">At length , we reached the cottage-door :</l>

     <l n="101">I 'd be right welcome : not a guest</l>
     <l n="102">Had crossed his threshold , thirty year ...</l>

     <l n="108">And , as I followed , struck a match ,</l>
     <l n="109">And lit a tallow-dip : and stirred</l>
     <l n="110">The banked-up peats into a glow :</l>
     <l n="111">And then with shuffling step and slow</l>
     <l n="112">He moved about : and soon had set</l>
     <l n="113">Two mugs of beer , and bread and cheese :</l>
     <l n="114">And while we made a meal off these ,</l>
     <l n="115">The old man never spoke a word ;</l>
     <l n="116">But , brooding in the ingle-seat ,</l>
     <l n="117">With eyes upon the kindling peat ,</l>
     <l n="118">He seemed awhile to quite forget</l>
     <l n="119">He was not sitting by himself</l>
     <l n="120">To-night , like any other night ;</l>
     <l n="121">When , as , in the dim candle-light ,</l>
     <l n="122">I glanced around me , with surprise</l>
     <l n="123">I saw , upon the rafter-shelf ,</l>
     <l n="124">A flute , nigh hidden in the shade .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="125">And when I asked him if he played ,</l>
     <l n="126">The light came back into his eyes :</l>
     <l n="127">Aye , aye , he sometimes piped a bit ,</l>
     <l n="128">But not so often since she died .</l>
     <l n="129">And then , as though old memories lit</l>
     <l n="130">His poor , old heart , and made it glad ,</l>
     <l n="131">He told how he , when quite a lad ,</l>
     <l n="132">Had taught himself : and they would play</l>
     <l n="133">On penny whistles all the day —</l>
     <l n="134">He and the miller 's son , beside</l>
     <l n="135">The millpool , chirping all they knew ,</l>
     <l n="136">Till they could whistle clean and true :</l>
     <l n="137">And how , when old enough to earn ,</l>
     <l n="138">They both saved up to buy a flute ;</l>
     <l n="139">And they had played it , turn for turn :</l>
     <l n="140">But , Jake was dead , this long while back ...</l>
     <l n="141">Ah ! if I 'd only heard him toot ,</l>
     <l n="142">I 'd know what music meant . Aye , aye ...</l>
     <l n="143">He 'd play me something , by-and-bye ;</l>
     <l n="144">Though he was naught to Jake ... and now</l>
     <l n="145">His breath was scant , and fingering slack ...</l>
     <l n="146">He used to play to her at night</l>
     <l n="147">The melodies that she liked best ,</l>
     <l n="148">While she worked on : she 'd never rest</l>
     <l n="149">By daylight , or by candle-light ...</l>
     <l n="150">And then , with hand upon his brow ,</l>
     <l n="151">He brooded , quiet in his chair ,</l>
     <l n="152">With eyes upon the red peat-glare ;</l>
     <l n="153">Until , at length , he roused himself ,</l>
     <l n="154">And reached the flute down from the shelf ;</l>
     <l n="155">And , carrying it outside the door ,</l>
     <l n="156">I saw him take a can , and pour</l>
     <l n="157">Fresh water through the instrument ,</l>
     <l n="158">To make it sweet of tone , he said .</l>
     <l n="159">Then , in his seat , so old and bent ,</l>
     <l n="160">With kindling eyes , and swaying head ,</l>
     <l n="161">He played the airs he used to play</l>
     <l n="162">To please his wife , before she died :</l>
     <l n="163">And as I watched his body sway</l>
     <l n="164">In time and tune , from side to side ,</l>
     <l n="165">So happy , playing , and to please</l>
     <l n="166">With old familiar melodies ,</l>
     <l n="167">His eyes grew brighter and more bright ,</l>
     <l n="168">As though they saw some well-loved sight :</l>
     <l n="169">And , following his happy gaze ,</l>
     <l n="170">I turned , and saw , without amaze ,</l>
     <l n="171">A woman standing , young and fair ,</l>
     <l n="172">With hazel eyes , and thick brown hair</l>
     <l n="173">Brushed smoothly backward from the brow ,</l>
     <l n="174">Beside the table that but now ,</l>
     <l n="175">Save for the empty mugs , was bare .</l>
     <l n="176">Upon it she had spread a sheet :</l>
     <l n="177">And stood there , ironing a shirt ,</l>
     <l n="178">Her husband 's , as he played to her</l>
     <l n="179">Her favourite tunes , so old and sweet .</l>
     <l n="180">I watched her move with soundless stir ;</l>
     <l n="181">Then stand with listening eyes , and hold</l>
     <l n="182">The iron near her glowing cheek ,</l>
     <l n="183">Lest it , too hot , should do some hurt ,</l>
     <l n="184">And she , so careful not to burn</l>
     <l n="185">The well-darned shirt , so worn and old .</l>
     <l n="186">Then , something seemed to make me turn</l>
     <l n="187">To look on the old man again :</l>
     <l n="188">And , as I looked , the playing stopped ;</l>
     <l n="189">And now I saw that he had dropped</l>
     <l n="190">Into his brooding mood once more ,</l>
     <l n="191">With eyes again grown dull and weak .</l>
     <l n="192">He seemed the oldest of old men</l>
     <l n="193">Who grope through life with sight worn dim</l>
     <l n="194">And , even as I looked at him ,</l>
     <l n="195">Too full of tender awe to speak ,</l>
     <l n="196">I knew once more the board was bare ,</l>
     <l n="197">With no young woman standing there</l>
     <l n="198">With hazel eyes and thick , brown hair ;</l>
     <l n="199">And I , in vain , for her should seek ,</l>
     <l n="200">If I but sought this side death 's door .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="201">And so , at last , I rose , and took</l>
     <l n="202">His hand : and as he clasped mine tight ,</l>
     <l n="203">I saw again that friendly look</l>
     <l n="204">Fill his old weary eyes with light ,</l>
     <l n="205">And wish me , without words , good-night</l>
     <l n="206">And in my heart , that look glowed bright</l>
     <l n="207">Till I reached home across the moor .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="208">And , at the corner of the lane ,</l>
     <l n="209">Next night , I heard the old voice cry</l>
     <l n="210">In greeting , as I struggled by ,</l>
     <l n="211">Head-down against the wind and rain .</l>
     <l n="212">And so each night , until one day ,</l>
     <l n="213">His master chanced across my way :</l>
     <l n="214">But , when I spoke of him , he said :</l>
     <l n="215">Did I not know the man was dead ,</l>
     <l n="216">And had been dead a week or so ?</l>
     <l n="217">One morn he 'd not turned up to work ;</l>
     <l n="218">And never having known him shirk ;</l>
     <l n="219">And hearing that he lived alone ;</l>
     <l n="220">He thought it best himself to go</l>
     <l n="221">And see what ailed : and coming there ,</l>
     <l n="222">He found the old man in his chair ,</l>
     <l n="223">Stone-dead beside the cold hearthstone .</l>
     <l n="224">It must be full a week , or more ...</l>
     <l n="225">Aye , just two weeks , come Saturday ,</l>
     <l n="226">He 'd found him ; but he must have died</l>
     <l n="227">O'ernight — ( the night I heard him play ! )</l>
     <l n="228">And they had found , dropt by his side ,</l>
     <l n="229">A broken flute upon the floor .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="230">Yet , every night , his greeting still</l>
     <l n="231">At that same corner of the hill ,</l>
     <l n="232">Summer and Winter , wet or dry ,</l>
     <l n="233">‘ Neath cloud , or moon , or cold starlight ,</l>
     <l n="234">Is waiting there to welcome me :</l>
     <l n="235">And ever as I hurry by ,</l>
     <l n="236">The old voice sings out cheerily :</l>
     <l n="237">“ Good-night ! ” and yet again , “ Good-night ! ”</l>
