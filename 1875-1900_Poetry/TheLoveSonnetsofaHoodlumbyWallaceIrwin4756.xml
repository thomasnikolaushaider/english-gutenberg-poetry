     <l n="2">“ Tell me , ye muses , what hath former ages</l>
     <l n="3">Now left succeeding times to play upon ,</l>
     <l n="4">And what remains unthought on by those sages</l>
     <l n="5">Where a new muse may try her pinion ? ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>So Complained Phineas Fletcher in his Purple Island as long ago as 1633 . Three centuries have brought to the development of lyric passion no higher form than that of the sonnet cycle . The sonnet has been likened to an exquisite crystal goblet that holds one sublimely inspired thought so perfectly that not another drop can be added without overflow . Cast in the early Italian Renaissance by Dante , Petrarch and Camoens , it was chased and ornamented during the Elizabethan period by Shakespere , and filled with its most stimulating draughts of song and love during the Victorian era by Rossetti , Browning and Meredith . And now , in this first year of the new century , the historic cup is refilled and tossed off in a radiant toast to Erato by Wallace Irwin .</p>
   <p>The attribute of modernity is not given to every new age . The cogs in the wheels of time slip back , at times . The classic revival may be permeated with enthusiasm , but it is a second edition of an old work — not a virile essay at expression of living thought . The later Renaissance was but half modern in its spirit ; the classic period of the eighteenth century in England was half ancient in its mood . But the twentieth century breaks with a new promise of emancipation to English Literature , for a new influence has freshened the blood of conventional style that in the decadence of the End of the Century had grown dilute . This adjuvant strain is found in the enthusiasm of Slang . Slowly its rhetorical power has won foothold in the language . It has won many a verb and substantive , it has conquered idiom and diction , and now it is strong enough to assault the very syntax of our Anglo-Saxon tongue . [*]</p>
   <p>[*] Note , for instance , the potential mood used indicatively in the current colloquial , “ Would n't that jar you ! ”</p>
   <p>Slang , the illegitimate sister of Poetry , makes with her a common cause against the utilitarian economy of Prose . They both stand for lavish luxuriance in trope and involution , for floriation and adornment of thought . It is their boast to make two words bloom where one grew before . Both garb themselves in Metaphor , and the only complaint of the captious can be that whereas Poetry follows the accepted style , Slang dresses her thought to suit herself in fantastic and bizarre caprices , that her whims are unstable and too often in bad taste .</p>
   <p>But this odium given to Slang by superficial minds is undeserved . In other days , before the language was crystallized into the idiom and verbiage of the doctrinaire , prose , too , was untrammeled . Indeed , a cursory glance at the Elizabethan poets discloses a kinship with the rebellious fancies of our modern colloquial talk . Mr. Irwin 's sonnets may be taken as an indication of this revolt , and how nearly they approach the incisive phrases of the seventeenth century may easily be shown in a few exemplars . For instance , in Sonnet XX , “ You 're the real tan bark ! ” we have a close parallel in Johnson 's Volpone , or The Fox :</p>
   <p>“ Fellows of outside and mere bark ! ”</p>
   <p>And this instance is an equally good illustration also of that curious process which , in the English language , has in time created for a single word ( “ cleave , ” for instance ) two exactly opposite meanings . A line from John Webster 's Appius and Virginia might be cited as showing how near his diction approached modern slang :</p>
   <p>“ My most neat and cunning orator , whose tongue is quicksilver ; ”</p>
   <p>and , for an analogy similar , though elaborate , compare lines 5-8 in Sonnet XI . In Beaumont and Fletcher 's Philaster ,</p>
   <p>“ A pernicious petticoat prince ”</p>
   <p>is as close to “ Mame 's dress-suit belle ” of No . VII as modern costume allows , and</p>
   <p>“ No , you scarab ! ”</p>
   <p>from Ben Jonson 's Alchemist gives a curious clue to the derivation of the popular term “ scab ” found in No . VI . Webster 's forcible picture in The White Devil —</p>
   <p>“ Fate is a spaniel ; we cannot beat it from us ! ”</p>
   <p>finds a rival in Mr. Irwin 's strong simile — “ O Fate , thou art a lobster ! ” in No . IV . And , to conclude , since such similarities might be quoted without end , note this exclamation from Beaumont and Fletcher 's Woman 's Prize , written before the name of the insect had achieved the infamy now fastened upon it by the British Matron :</p>
   <p>“ These are bug 's words ! ”</p>
   <p>Not only does this evidently point out the origin of “ Jim-jam bugs ” in No . IX , and the better known modern synonym for brain , “ bug-house , ” but it indicates the arbitrary tendency of all language to create gradations of caste in parts of speech . It is to this mysterious influence by which some words become “ elegant ” or “ poetic , ” and others “ coarse ” or “ unrefined , ” that we owe the contempt in which slang is held by the superficial Philistine .</p>
   <p>In Mr. Irwin 's sonnet cycle , however , we have slang idealized , or as perhaps one might better say , sublimated . Evolution in the argot of the streets works by a process of substitution . A phrase of two terms goes through a system of permutation before it is discarded or adopted into authorized metaphor . “ To take the cake , ” for instance , a figure from the cake-walk of the negroes , becomes to “ capture ” or “ corral ” the “ bun ” or “ biscuit . ” Nor is this all , for in the higher forms of slang the idea is paraphrased in the most elaborate verbiage , an involution so intricate that , without a knowledge of the intervening steps , the meaning is often almost wholly lost . Specimens of this cryptology are found in many of Mr. Irwin 's sonnets , notably in No . V :</p>
   <p>“ My syncopated con-talk no avail . ”</p>
   <p>We trace these synonyms through “ rag-time , ” etc ., to an almost subliminal thought — an adjective resembling “ verisimilitudinarious , ” perhaps , qualifying the “ con ” or confidential talk that proved useless to bring Mame back to his devotion .</p>
   <p>In the masterly couplet closing the sestet of No . XVIII , Mr. Irwin 's verbal enthusiasm reaches its highest mark in an ultra-Meredithian rendition of “ I am an easy mark , ” an expression , by the way , which would itself have to be elaborately translated in any English edition .</p>
   <p>Enough of the glamors of Mr. Irwin 's dulcet vagaries . He will stand , perhaps as the chief apostle of the hyperconcrete . With Mr. Ade as the head of the school , and insistent upon the didactic value of slang , Mr. Irwin presents in this cycle no mean claims to eminence in the truly lyric vein . Let us turn to a contemplation of his more modest hero .</p>
   <p>I have attempted in vain to identify him , the “ Willie ” of these sonnets . The police court records of San Francisco abound in characters from which Mr. Irwin 's conception of this pyrotechnically garrulous Hoodlum might have been drawn , and even his death from cigarette-smoking , prognosticated in No . XXII , does not sufficiently identify him . Whoever he was , he was a type of the latter-day lover , instinct with that self-analysis and consciousness of the dramatic value of his emotion that has reached even the lower classes . The sequence of the sonnets clearly indicates the progress of his love affair with Mary , a heroine who has , in common with the heroines of previous sonnet cycles , Laura , Stella and Beatricia , only this , that she inspired her lover to an eloquence that might have been better spent orally upon the object of his affections . Even the author 's scorn does not prevent the reader from indulging in a surreptitious sympathy with the flamboyant coquetry of his “ peacherino , ” his “ Paris Pansy . ” For she , too , was of the caste of the articulate ; did she not</p>
   <p>“ Cough up loops of kindergarten chin ? ”</p>
   <p>and could we hear Mame 's side of the quarrel , no doubt our Hoodlum would be convicted by every reader . But Kid Murphy , the pusillanimous rival , was even less worthy of the superb Amazon who bore him to the altar . “ See how that Murphy cake-walks in his pride ! ” is the cri-du-coeur the gentlest reader must inevitably render .</p>
   <p>But “ the Peach crops come and go , ” as Mr. George Ade so eloquently observes . We must not take our hero 's gloomy threats too seriously . There are other babies on the bunch , and no doubt he is , long ere this , consoled with a “ neater , sweeter maiden ” to whom his Muse will sing again a happier refrain . In this hope we close his dainty introspections and await his next burst of song !</p>
