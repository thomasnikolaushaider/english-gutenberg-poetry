       <l n="1">My heart is beating up and down ,</l>
       <l n="2">Is walking like some heavy feet .</l>
       <l n="3">My heart is going every day ,</l>
       <l n="4">And I can hear it jump and beat .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="5">At night before I go to sleep ,</l>
       <l n="6">I feel it beating in my head ;</l>
       <l n="7">I hear it jumping in my neck</l>
       <l n="8">And in the pillow on my bed .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="9">And then I make some little words</l>
       <l n="10">To go along and say with it —</l>
       <l n="11">The men are sailing home from Troy ,</l>
       <l n="12">And all the lamps are lit .</l>

      <head>THE HENS</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">The night was coming very fast ;</l>
       <l n="2">It reached the gate as I ran past .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="3">The pigeons had gone to the tower of the church</l>
       <l n="4">And all the hens were on their perch ,</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="5">Up in the barn , and I thought I heard</l>
       <l n="6">A piece of a little purring word .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="7">I stopped inside , waiting and staying ,</l>
       <l n="8">To try to hear what the hens were saying .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="9">They were asking something , that was plain ,</l>
       <l n="10">Asking it over and over again .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="11">One of them moved and turned around ,</l>
       <l n="12">Her feathers made a ruffled sound ,</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="13">A ruffled sound , like a bushful of birds ,</l>
       <l n="14">And she said her little asking words .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="15">She pushed her head close into her wing ,</l>
       <l n="16">But nothing answered anything .</l>

       <l n="17">The end of Under the Tree</l>
