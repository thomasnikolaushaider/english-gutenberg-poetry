   <p>“ Here , beyond question , in The Everlasting Mercy , is a great poem , as true to the essentials of its ancient art as it is astoundingly modern in its method ; a poem , too , which ‘ every clergyman in the country ought to read as a revelation of the heathenism still left in the land . ’ ... Its technical force is on a level with its high , inspiring thought . It makes the reader think ; it goads him to emotion ; and it leaves him alive with a fresh appreciation of the wonderful capacity of human nature to receive new influences and atone for old and apparently ineradicable wrongs . ” — ARTHUR WAUGH in The Daily Chronicle .</p>

   <p>“ Mr Masefield is no common realist , but universalises his tragedy in the grand manner .... We are convinced that he is writing truly of human nature , which is the vital thing .... The last few stanzas show us pastoral poetry in the very perfection of simplicity . ” — Spectator .</p>
   <p>“ In ‘ The Widow in the Bye Street ’ all Mr Masefield 's passionate love of loveliness is utterly fused with the violent and unlovely story , which glows with an inner harmony . The poem , it is true , ends on a note of idyllism which recalls Theocritus ; but this is no touch of eternal decoration . Inevitably the story has worked towards this culmination . ” — Bookman .</p>

   <p>“ In this Roman tragedy , while we admire its closely knit structure , dramatic effectiveness , and atmosphere of reality ... the warmth and colour of the diction are the most notable things .... He knows the art of phrasing ; he has the instinct for and by them . ” — Athenaeum .</p>

   <p>“ Unlike most youthful work it shows a curious absence of imitation and a strenuous originality ... there is much that is uncommonly good . He has both imagination and intellect — so much of the latter sometimes that the verse is crabbed and heavy with its weight of it . It is a book of rare and remarkable promise . ” — Spectator .</p>

   <p>“ It is impossible to shred up this beauty for the purpose of criticism . These sonnets are personal — never were sonnets more personal since Sidney died — and yet the very blood and youth of England seem to find expression in them . They speak not for one heart only , but for all to whom her call has come in the hour of need and found instantly ready . ” — Times .</p>
