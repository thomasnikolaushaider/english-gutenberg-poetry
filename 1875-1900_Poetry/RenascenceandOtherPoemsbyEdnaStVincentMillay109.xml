      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">All I could see from where I stood</l>
       <l n="2">Was three long mountains and a wood ;</l>
       <l n="3">I turned and looked another way ,</l>
       <l n="4">And saw three islands in a bay .</l>
       <l n="5">So with my eyes I traced the line</l>
       <l n="6">Of the horizon , thin and fine ,</l>
       <l n="7">Straight around till I was come</l>
       <l n="8">Back to where I 'd started from ;</l>
       <l n="9">And all I saw from where I stood</l>
       <l n="10">Was three long mountains and a wood .</l>
       <l n="11">Over these things I could not see ;</l>
       <l n="12">These were the things that bounded me ;</l>
       <l n="13">And I could touch them with my hand ,</l>
       <l n="14">Almost , I thought , from where I stand .</l>
       <l n="15">And all at once things seemed so small</l>
       <l n="16">My breath came short , and scarce at all .</l>
       <l n="17">But , sure , the sky is big , I said ;</l>
       <l n="18">Miles and miles above my head ;</l>
       <l n="19">So here upon my back I 'll lie</l>
       <l n="20">And look my fill into the sky .</l>
       <l n="21">And so I looked , and , after all ,</l>
       <l n="22">The sky was not so very tall .</l>
       <l n="23">The sky , I said , must somewhere stop ,</l>
       <l n="24">And — sure enough !— I see the top !</l>
       <l n="25">The sky , I thought , is not so grand ;</l>
       <l n="26">I ‘ most could touch it with my hand !</l>
       <l n="27">And reaching up my hand to try ,</l>
       <l n="28">I screamed to feel it touch the sky .</l>
       <l n="29">I screamed , and — lo !— Infinity</l>
       <l n="30">Came down and settled over me ;</l>
       <l n="31">Forced back my scream into my chest ,</l>
       <l n="32">Bent back my arm upon my breast ,</l>
       <l n="33">And , pressing of the Undefined</l>
       <l n="34">The definition on my mind ,</l>
       <l n="35">Held up before my eyes a glass</l>
       <l n="36">Through which my shrinking sight did pass</l>
       <l n="37">Until it seemed I must behold</l>
       <l n="38">Immensity made manifold ;</l>
       <l n="39">Whispered to me a word whose sound</l>
       <l n="40">Deafened the air for worlds around ,</l>
       <l n="41">And brought unmuffled to my ears</l>
       <l n="42">The gossiping of friendly spheres ,</l>
       <l n="43">The creaking of the tented sky ,</l>
       <l n="44">The ticking of Eternity .</l>
       <l n="45">I saw and heard , and knew at last</l>
       <l n="46">The How and Why of all things , past ,</l>
       <l n="47">And present , and forevermore .</l>
       <l n="48">The Universe , cleft to the core ,</l>
       <l n="49">Lay open to my probing sense</l>
       <l n="50">That , sick'ning , I would fain pluck thence</l>
       <l n="51">But could not ,— nay ! But needs must suck</l>
       <l n="52">At the great wound , and could not pluck</l>
       <l n="53">My lips away till I had drawn</l>
       <l n="54">All venom out .— Ah , fearful pawn !</l>
       <l n="55">For my omniscience paid I toll</l>
       <l n="56">In infinite remorse of soul .</l>
       <l n="57">All sin was of my sinning , all</l>
       <l n="58">Atoning mine , and mine the gall</l>
       <l n="59">Of all regret . Mine was the weight</l>
       <l n="60">Of every brooded wrong , the hate</l>
       <l n="61">That stood behind each envious thrust ,</l>
       <l n="62">Mine every greed , mine every lust .</l>
       <l n="63">And all the while for every grief ,</l>
       <l n="64">Each suffering , I craved relief</l>
       <l n="65">With individual desire ,—</l>
       <l n="66">Craved all in vain ! And felt fierce fire</l>
       <l n="67">About a thousand people crawl ;</l>
       <l n="68">Perished with each ,— then mourned for all !</l>
       <l n="69">A man was starving in Capri ;</l>
       <l n="70">He moved his eyes and looked at me ;</l>
       <l n="71">I felt his gaze , I heard his moan ,</l>
       <l n="72">And knew his hunger as my own .</l>
       <l n="73">I saw at sea a great fog bank</l>
       <l n="74">Between two ships that struck and sank ;</l>
       <l n="75">A thousand screams the heavens smote ;</l>
       <l n="76">And every scream tore through my throat .</l>
       <l n="77">No hurt I did not feel , no death</l>
       <l n="78">That was not mine ; mine each last breath</l>
       <l n="79">That , crying , met an answering cry</l>
       <l n="80">From the compassion that was I .</l>
       <l n="81">All suffering mine , and mine its rod ;</l>
       <l n="82">Mine , pity like the pity of God .</l>
       <l n="83">Ah , awful weight ! Infinity</l>
       <l n="84">Pressed down upon the finite Me !</l>
       <l n="85">My anguished spirit , like a bird ,</l>
       <l n="86">Beating against my lips I heard ;</l>
       <l n="87">Yet lay the weight so close about</l>
       <l n="88">There was no room for it without .</l>
       <l n="89">And so beneath the weight lay I</l>
       <l n="90">And suffered death , but could not die .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="91">Long had I lain thus , craving death ,</l>
       <l n="92">When quietly the earth beneath</l>
       <l n="93">Gave way , and inch by inch , so great</l>
       <l n="94">At last had grown the crushing weight ,</l>
       <l n="95">Into the earth I sank till I</l>
       <l n="96">Full six feet under ground did lie ,</l>
       <l n="97">And sank no more ,— there is no weight</l>
       <l n="98">Can follow here , however great .</l>
       <l n="99">From off my breast I felt it roll ,</l>
       <l n="100">And as it went my tortured soul</l>
       <l n="101">Burst forth and fled in such a gust</l>
       <l n="102">That all about me swirled the dust .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="103">Deep in the earth I rested now ;</l>
       <l n="104">Cool is its hand upon the brow</l>
       <l n="105">And soft its breast beneath the head</l>
       <l n="106">Of one who is so gladly dead .</l>
       <l n="107">And all at once , and over all</l>
       <l n="108">The pitying rain began to fall ;</l>
       <l n="109">I lay and heard each pattering hoof</l>
       <l n="110">Upon my lowly , thatched roof ,</l>
       <l n="111">And seemed to love the sound far more</l>
       <l n="112">Than ever I had done before .</l>
       <l n="113">For rain it hath a friendly sound</l>
       <l n="114">To one who 's six feet underground ;</l>
       <l n="115">And scarce the friendly voice or face :</l>
       <l n="116">A grave is such a quiet place .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="117">The rain , I said , is kind to come</l>
       <l n="118">And speak to me in my new home .</l>
       <l n="119">I would I were alive again</l>
       <l n="120">To kiss the fingers of the rain ,</l>
       <l n="121">To drink into my eyes the shine</l>
       <l n="122">Of every slanting silver line ,</l>
       <l n="123">To catch the freshened , fragrant breeze</l>
       <l n="124">From drenched and dripping apple-trees .</l>
       <l n="125">For soon the shower will be done ,</l>
       <l n="126">And then the broad face of the sun</l>
       <l n="127">Will laugh above the rain-soaked earth</l>
       <l n="128">Until the world with answering mirth</l>
       <l n="129">Shakes joyously , and each round drop</l>
       <l n="130">Rolls , twinkling , from its grass-blade top .</l>
       <l n="131">How can I bear it ; buried here ,</l>
       <l n="132">While overhead the sky grows clear</l>
       <l n="133">And blue again after the storm ?</l>
       <l n="134">O , multi-colored , multiform ,</l>
       <l n="135">Beloved beauty over me ,</l>
       <l n="136">That I shall never , never see</l>
       <l n="137">Again ! Spring-silver , autumn-gold ,</l>
       <l n="138">That I shall never more behold !</l>
       <l n="139">Sleeping your myriad magics through ,</l>
       <l n="140">Close-sepulchred away from you !</l>
       <l n="141">O God , I cried , give me new birth ,</l>
       <l n="142">And put me back upon the earth !</l>
       <l n="143">Upset each cloud 's gigantic gourd</l>
       <l n="144">And let the heavy rain , down-poured</l>
       <l n="145">In one big torrent , set me free ,</l>
       <l n="146">Washing my grave away from me !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="147">I ceased ; and through the breathless hush</l>
       <l n="148">That answered me , the far-off rush</l>
       <l n="149">Of herald wings came whispering</l>
       <l n="150">Like music down the vibrant string</l>
       <l n="151">Of my ascending prayer , and — crash !</l>
       <l n="152">Before the wild wind 's whistling lash</l>
       <l n="153">The startled storm-clouds reared on high</l>
       <l n="154">And plunged in terror down the sky ,</l>
       <l n="155">And the big rain in one black wave</l>
       <l n="156">Fell from the sky and struck my grave .</l>
       <l n="157">I know not how such things can be ;</l>
       <l n="158">I only know there came to me</l>
       <l n="159">A fragrance such as never clings</l>
       <l n="160">To aught save happy living things ;</l>
       <l n="161">A sound as of some joyous elf</l>
       <l n="162">Singing sweet songs to please himself ,</l>
       <l n="163">And , through and over everything ,</l>
       <l n="164">A sense of glad awakening .</l>
       <l n="165">The grass , a-tiptoe at my ear ,</l>
       <l n="166">Whispering to me I could hear ;</l>
       <l n="167">I felt the rain 's cool finger-tips</l>
       <l n="168">Brushed tenderly across my lips ,</l>
       <l n="169">Laid gently on my sealed sight ,</l>
       <l n="170">And all at once the heavy night</l>
       <l n="171">Fell from my eyes and I could see ,—</l>
       <l n="172">A drenched and dripping apple-tree ,</l>
       <l n="173">A last long line of silver rain ,</l>
       <l n="174">A sky grown clear and blue again .</l>
       <l n="175">And as I looked a quickening gust</l>
       <l n="176">Of wind blew up to me and thrust</l>
       <l n="177">Into my face a miracle</l>
       <l n="178">Of orchard-breath , and with the smell ,—</l>
       <l n="179">I know not how such things can be !—</l>
       <l n="180">I breathed my soul back into me .</l>
       <l n="181">Ah ! Up then from the ground sprang I</l>
       <l n="182">And hailed the earth with such a cry</l>
       <l n="183">As is not heard save from a man</l>
       <l n="184">Who has been dead , and lives again .</l>
       <l n="185">About the trees my arms I wound ;</l>
       <l n="186">Like one gone mad I hugged the ground ;</l>
       <l n="187">I raised my quivering arms on high ;</l>
       <l n="188">I laughed and laughed into the sky ,</l>
       <l n="189">Till at my throat a strangling sob</l>
       <l n="190">Caught fiercely , and a great heart-throb</l>
       <l n="191">Sent instant tears into my eyes ;</l>
       <l n="192">O God , I cried , no dark disguise</l>
       <l n="193">Can e'er hereafter hide from me</l>
       <l n="194">Thy radiant identity !</l>
       <l n="195">Thou canst not move across the grass</l>
       <l n="196">But my quick eyes will see Thee pass ,</l>
       <l n="197">Nor speak , however silently ,</l>
       <l n="198">But my hushed voice will answer Thee .</l>
       <l n="199">I know the path that tells Thy way</l>
       <l n="200">Through the cool eve of every day ;</l>
       <l n="201">God , I can push the grass apart</l>
       <l n="202">And lay my finger on Thy heart !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="203">The world stands out on either side</l>
       <l n="204">No wider than the heart is wide ;</l>
       <l n="205">Above the world is stretched the sky ,—</l>
       <l n="206">No higher than the soul is high .</l>
       <l n="207">The heart can push the sea and land</l>
       <l n="208">Farther away on either hand ;</l>
       <l n="209">The soul can split the sky in two ,</l>
       <l n="210">And let the face of God shine through .</l>
       <l n="211">But East and West will pinch the heart</l>
       <l n="212">That can not keep them pushed apart ;</l>
       <l n="213">And he whose soul is flat — the sky</l>
       <l n="214">Will cave in on him by and by .</l>

       <l n="4">A something in the air , intangible ,</l>

       <l n="82">My father 's house ! There in the night I came ,</l>
       <l n="83">And found them feasting , and all things the same</l>
       <l n="84">As they had been before . A splendour hung</l>

       <l n="87">Had called me from the house of Life , I know .</l>

       <l n="93">Tattered and dark I entered , like a cloud ,</l>
       <l n="94">Seeing no face but his ; to him I crept ,</l>
       <l n="95">And “ Father ! ” I cried , and clasped his knees , and wept .</l>
       <l n="96">Ah , days of joy that followed ! All alone</l>
       <l n="97">I wandered through the house . My own , my own ,</l>
       <l n="98">My own to touch , my own to taste and smell ,</l>
       <l n="99">All I had lacked so long and loved so well !</l>
       <l n="100">None shook me out of sleep , nor hushed my song ,</l>

       <l n="105">The tall and gracious messengers he sent .</l>
       <l n="106">Yet one day with no song from dawn till night</l>
       <l n="107">Wondering , I sat , and watched them out of sight .</l>

       <l n="109">Asked them if I might go ,— but no one heard .</l>
       <l n="110">Then , sick with longing , I arose at last</l>
       <l n="111">And went unto my father ,— in that vast</l>
       <l n="112">Chamber wherein he for so many years</l>
       <l n="113">Has sat , surrounded by his charts and spheres .</l>
       <l n="114">“ Father , ” I said , “ Father , I cannot play</l>

       <l n="119">Better a perilous journey overseas</l>
       <l n="120">Away from thee , than this , the life I lead ,</l>
       <l n="121">To sit all day in the sunshine like a weed</l>
       <l n="122">That grows to naught ,— I love thee more than they</l>
       <l n="123">Who serve thee most ; yet serve thee in no way .</l>
       <l n="124">Father , I beg of thee a little task</l>
       <l n="125">To dignify my days ,— ‘ tis all I ask</l>
       <l n="126">Forever , but forever , this denied ,</l>
       <l n="127">I perish . ”</l>
       <l n="128">“ Child , ” my father 's voice replied ,</l>
       <l n="129">“ All things thy fancy hath desired of me</l>
       <l n="130">Thou hast received . I have prepared for thee</l>
       <l n="131">Within my house a spacious chamber , where</l>
       <l n="132">Are delicate things to handle and to wear ,</l>
       <l n="133">And all these things are thine . Dost thou love song ?</l>
       <l n="134">My minstrels shall attend thee all day long .</l>
