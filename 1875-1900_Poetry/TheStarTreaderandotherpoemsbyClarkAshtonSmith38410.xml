     <l n="2">This Rome , that was the toil of many men ,</l>
     <l n="3">The consummation of laborious years —</l>
     <l n="4">Fulfilment 's crown to visions of the dead ,</l>
     <l n="5">And image of the wide desire of kings —</l>
     <l n="6">Is made my darkling dream 's effulgency ,</l>
     <l n="7">Fuel of vision , brief embodiment</l>
     <l n="8">Of wandering will , and wastage of the strong</l>
     <l n="9">Fierce ecstacy of one tremendous hour ,</l>
     <l n="10">When ages piled on ages were a flame</l>
     <l n="11">To all the years behind , and years to be .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="12">Yet any sunset were as much as this ,</l>
     <l n="13">Save for the music forced by hands of fire</l>
     <l n="14">From out the hard strait silences which bind</l>
     <l n="15">Dull Matter 's tongueless mouth — a music pierced</l>
     <l n="16">With the tense voice of Life , more quick to cry</l>
     <l n="17">Its agony — and save that I believed</l>
     <l n="18">The radiance redder for the blood of men .</l>
     <l n="19">Destruction hastens and intensifies</l>
     <l n="20">The process that is Beauty , manifests</l>
     <l n="21">Ranges of form unknown before , and gives</l>
     <l n="22">Motion and voice and hue where otherwise</l>
     <l n="23">Bleak inexpressiveness had leveled all .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="24">If one create , there is the lengthy toil ;</l>
     <l n="25">The laboured years and days league tow'rd an end</l>
     <l n="26">Less than the measure of desire , mayhap ,</l>
     <l n="27">After the sure consuming of all strength ,</l>
     <l n="28">And strain of faculties that otherwhere</l>
     <l n="29">Were loosed upon enjoyment ; and at last</l>
     <l n="30">Remains to one capacity nor power</l>
     <l n="31">For pleasure in the thing that he hath made .</l>
     <l n="32">But on destruction hangs but little use</l>
     <l n="33">Of time or faculty , but all is turned</l>
     <l n="34">To the one purpose , unobstructed , pure ,</l>
     <l n="35">Of sensuous rapture and observant joy ;</l>
     <l n="36">And from the intensities of death and ruin ,</l>
     <l n="37">One draws a heightened and completer life ,</l>
     <l n="38">And both extends and vindicates himself .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="39">I would I were a god , with all the scope</l>
     <l n="40">Of attributes that are the essential core</l>
     <l n="41">Of godhead , and its visibility .</l>
     <l n="42">I am but emperor , and hold awhile</l>
     <l n="43">The power to hasten Death upon his way ,</l>
     <l n="44">And cry a halt to worn and lagging Life</l>
     <l n="45">For others , but for mine own self may not</l>
     <l n="46">Delay the one , nor bid the other speed .</l>
     <l n="47">There have been many kings , and they are dead ,</l>
     <l n="48">And have no power in death save what the wind</l>
     <l n="49">Confers upon their blown and brainless dust</l>
     <l n="50">To vex the eyeballs of posterity .</l>
     <l n="51">But were I god , I would be overlord</l>
     <l n="52">Of many kings , and were as breath to guide</l>
     <l n="53">Their dust of destiny . And were I god ,</l>
     <l n="54">Exempt from this mortality which clogs</l>
     <l n="55">Perception , and clear exercise of will ,</l>
     <l n="56">What rapture it would be , if but to watch</l>
     <l n="57">Destruction crouching at the back of Time ,</l>
     <l n="58">The tongueless dooms which dog the travelling suns ;</l>
     <l n="59">The vampire Silence at the breast of worlds ,</l>
     <l n="60">Fire without light that gnaws the base of things ,</l>
     <l n="61">And Lethe 's mounting tide , that rots the stone</l>
     <l n="62">Of fundamental spheres . This were enough</l>
     <l n="63">Till such time as the dazzled wings of will</l>
     <l n="64">Came up with power 's accession , scarcely felt</l>
     <l n="65">For very suddenness . Then would I urge</l>
     <l n="66">The strong contention and conflicting might</l>
     <l n="67">Of chaos and creation , matching them ,</l>
     <l n="68">Those immemorial powers inimical ,</l>
     <l n="69">And all their stars and gulfs subservient —</l>
     <l n="70">Dynasts of Time , and anarchs of the dark —</l>
     <l n="71">In closer war reverseless ; and would set</l>
     <l n="72">New discord at the universal core ,</l>
     <l n="73">A Samson-principle to bring it down</l>
     <l n="74">In one magnificence of ruin . Yea ,</l>
     <l n="75">The monster Chaos were mine unleashed hound ,</l>
     <l n="76">And all my power Destruction 's own right arm !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="77">I would exult to mark the smouldering stars</l>
     <l n="78">Renew beneath my breath their elder fire ,</l>
     <l n="79">And feed upon themselves to nothingness .</l>
     <l n="80">The might of suns , slow-paced with swinging weight</l>
     <l n="81">Of myriad worlds , were made at my desire</l>
     <l n="82">One long rapidity of roaring light ,</l>
     <l n="83">Through which the voice of Life were audible ,</l>
     <l n="84">And singing of the immemorial dead</l>
     <l n="85">Whose dust is loosened into vaporous wings</l>
     <l n="86">With soaring wrack of systems ruinous .</l>
     <l n="87">And were I weary of the glare of these ,</l>
     <l n="88">I would tear out the eyes of light , and stand</l>
     <l n="89">Above a chaos of extinguished suns ,</l>
     <l n="90">That crowd , and grind , and shiver thunderously ,</l>
     <l n="91">Lending vast voice and motion , but no ray</l>
     <l n="92">To the stretched silence of the blinded gulfs .</l>
     <l n="93">Thus would I give my godhead space and speech</l>
     <l n="94">For its assertion , and thus pleasure it ,</l>
     <l n="95">Hastening the feet of Time with casts of worlds</l>
     <l n="96">Like careless pebbles , or with shattered suns</l>
     <l n="97">Brightening the aspect of Eternity .</l>
    </lg>
    <p>CHANT TO SIRIUS</p>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="98">What nights retard thee , O Sirius !</l>
     <l n="99">Thy light is as a spear ,</l>
     <l n="100">And thou penetratest them</l>
     <l n="101">As a warrior that stabbeth his foe</l>
     <l n="102">Even to the center of his life .</l>
     <l n="103">Thy rays reach farther than the gulfs ;</l>
     <l n="104">They form a bridge thereover ,</l>
     <l n="105">That shall endure till the links of the universe</l>
     <l n="106">Are unfastened , and drop apart ,</l>
     <l n="107">And all the gulfs are one ,</l>
     <l n="108">Dissevered by suns no longer .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="109">How strong art thou in thy place !</l>
     <l n="110">Thou stridest thine orbit ,</l>
     <l n="111">And the darkness shakes beneath thee ,</l>
     <l n="112">As a road that is trodden by an army .</l>
     <l n="113">Thou art a god ,</l>
     <l n="114">In thy temple that is hollowed with light</l>
     <l n="115">In the night of infinitude ,</l>
     <l n="116">And whose floor is the lower void ;</l>
     <l n="117">Thy worlds are as priests and ministers therein .</l>
     <l n="118">Thou furrowest space ,</l>
     <l n="119">Even as an husbandman ,</l>
     <l n="120">And sowest it with alien seed ;</l>
     <l n="121">It beareth alien fruits ,</l>
     <l n="122">And these are thy testimony ,</l>
     <l n="123">Even as the crops of his fields</l>
     <l n="124">Are the testimony of an husbandman .</l>

    <lg type="part" n="1">

     <lg type="stanza" n="9">
      <l n="125">A voice cried to me in a dawn of dreams ,</l>
      <l n="126">Saying , “ Make haste : the webs of death and birth</l>
      <l n="127">Are brushed away , and all the threads of earth</l>
      <l n="128">Wear to the breaking ; spaceward gleams</l>
      <l n="129">Thine ancient pathway of the suns ,</l>
      <l n="130">Whose flame is part of thee ;</l>
      <l n="131">And deeps outreach immutably</l>
      <l n="132">Whose largeness runs</l>
      <l n="133">Through all thy spirit 's mystery .</l>
      <l n="134">Go forth , and tread unharmed the blaze</l>
      <l n="135">Of stars where through thou camest in old days ;</l>
      <l n="136">Pierce without fear each vast</l>
      <l n="137">Whose hugeness crushed thee not within the past .</l>
      <l n="138">A hand strikes off the chains of Time ,</l>
      <l n="139">A hand swings back the door of years ;</l>
      <l n="140">Now fall earth 's bonds of gladness and of tears ,</l>
      <l n="141">And opens the strait dream to space sublime . ”</l>

      <l n="148">My soul was flung , and poised , and whirled ,</l>

     <l n="252">And wasteful plains , should overtake them there ,</l>
     <l n="253">Bowed with too heavy a burden of defeat .</l>
     <l n="254">Slowly they turned , and passed upon the west</l>
     <l n="255">Where , like a weariness immovable</l>
     <l n="256">In menace huge , the plain its monstrous bulk ,</l>
     <l n="257">The peaks its hydra heads , the whole world crouched</l>

   <note>It seemed that from the west The live red flame of sunset , Eating the dead blue sky And cold insensate peaks , Was loosened slowly , and fell . Above it , a few red stars Burned down like low candle-flames Into the gaunt black sockets Of the chill insensible mountains . But in the ascendant skies ( Cloudless , like some vast corpse Unfeatured , cerementless ) Succeeded nor star nor planet . It may have been that black , Pulseless , dead stars arose And crossed as of old the heavens . But came no living orb , Nor comet seeming the ghost , Homeless , of an outcast world , Seeking its former place That is no more nor shall be In all the Cosmos again . Null , blank , and meaningless As a burnt scroll that blackens With the passing of the fire , Lay the dead infinite sky . Lo ! in the halls of Time , I thought , the torches are out — The revelry of the gods , Or lamentation of demons For which their flames were lit , Over and quiet at last With the closing peace of night , Whose dumb , dead , passionless skies Enfold the living world As the sea a sinking pebble .</note>
