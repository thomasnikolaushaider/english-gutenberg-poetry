     <head>THE LORD OF MISRULE</head>
     <p>“ On May days the wild heads of the parish would choose a Lord of Misrule , whom they would follow even into the church , though the minister were at prayer or preaching , dancing and swinging their may-boughs about like devils incarnate . ” — Old Puritan Writer .</p>
     <lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">All on a fresh May morning , I took my love to church ,</l>
       <l n="2">To see if Parson Primrose were safely on his perch .</l>
       <l n="3">He scarce had got to Thirdly , or squire begun to snore ,</l>
       <l n="4">When , like a sun-lit sea-wave ,</l>
       <l n="5">A green and crimson sea-wave ,</l>
       <l n="6">A frolic of madcap May-folk came whooping through the door :—</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="7">Come up , come in with streamers !</l>
       <l n="8">Come in , with boughs of may !</l>
       <l n="9">Come up and thump the sexton ,</l>
       <l n="10">And carry the clerk away .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="11">Now skip like rams , ye mountains ,</l>
       <l n="12">Ye little hills , like sheep !</l>
       <l n="13">Come up and wake the people</l>
       <l n="14">That parson puts to sleep .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="15">They tickled their nut-brown tabors . Their garlands flew in showers ,</l>
       <l n="16">And lasses and lads came after them , with feet like dancing flowers .</l>
       <l n="17">Their queen had torn her green gown , and bared a shoulder as white ,</l>
       <l n="18">O , white as the may that crowned her ,</l>
       <l n="19">While all the minstrels round her</l>
       <l n="20">Tilted back their crimson hats and sang for sheer delight :</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="21">Come up , come in with streamers !</l>
       <l n="22">Come in , with boughs of may !</l>
       <l n="23">Now by the gold upon your toe</l>
       <l n="24">You walked the primrose way .</l>
       <l n="25">Come up , with white and crimson !</l>
       <l n="26">O , shake your bells and sing ;</l>
       <l n="27">Let the porch bend , the pillars bow ,</l>
       <l n="28">Before our Lord , the Spring !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="29">The dusty velvet hassocks were dabbled with fragrant dew .</l>
       <l n="30">The font grew white with hawthorn . It frothed in every pew .</l>
       <l n="31">Three petals clung to the sexton 's beard as he mopped and mowed at the</l>
       <l n="32">clerk ,</l>
       <l n="33">And “ Take that sexton away , ” they cried ;</l>
       <l n="34">“ Did Nebuchadnezzar eat may ? ” they cried .</l>
       <l n="35">“ Nay , that was a prize from Betty , ” they cried , “ for kissing her in the</l>
       <l n="36">dark . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="37">Come up , come in with streamers !</l>
       <l n="38">Come in , with boughs of may !</l>
       <l n="39">Who knows but old Methuselah</l>
       <l n="40">May hobble the green-wood way ?</l>
       <l n="41">If Betty could kiss the sexton ,</l>
       <l n="42">If Kitty could kiss the clerk ,</l>
       <l n="43">Who knows how Parson Primrose</l>
       <l n="44">Might blossom in the dark ?</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="45">The congregation spluttered . The squire grew purple and all ,</l>
       <l n="46">And every little chorister bestrode his carven stall .</l>
       <l n="47">The parson flapped like a magpie , but none could hear his prayers ;</l>
       <l n="48">For Tom Fool flourished his tabor ,</l>
       <l n="49">Flourished his nut-brown tabor ,</l>
       <l n="50">Bashed the head of the sexton , and stormed the pulpit stairs .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="9">
       <l n="51">High in the old oak pulpit</l>
       <l n="52">This Lord of all misrule —</l>
       <l n="53">I think it was Will Summers</l>
       <l n="54">That once was Shakespeare 's fool —</l>
       <l n="55">Held up his hand for silence ,</l>
       <l n="56">And all the church grew still :</l>
       <l n="57">“ And are you snoring yet , ” he said ,</l>
       <l n="58">“ Or have you slept your fill ?</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="10">
       <l n="59">“ Your God still walks in Eden , between the ancient trees ,</l>
       <l n="60">Where Youth and Love go wading through pools of primroses .</l>
       <l n="61">And this is the sign we bring you , before the darkness fall ,</l>
       <l n="62">That Spring is risen , is risen again ,</l>
       <l n="63">That Life is risen , is risen again ,</l>
       <l n="64">That Love is risen , is risen again , and Love is Lord of all .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="11">
       <l n="65">“ At Paske began our morrice</l>
       <l n="66">And , ere Pentecost , our May ;</l>
       <l n="67">Because , albeit your words be true ,</l>
       <l n="68">You know not what you say .</l>
       <l n="69">You chatter in church like jackdaws ,</l>
       <l n="70">Words that would wake the dead ,</l>
       <l n="71">Were there one breath of life in you ,</l>
       <l n="72">One drop of blood , ” he said .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="12">
       <l n="73">“ He died and He went down to hell ! You know not what you mean .</l>
       <l n="74">Our rafters were of green fir . Also our beds were green .</l>
       <l n="75">But out of the mouth of a fool , a fool , before the darkness fall ,</l>
       <l n="76">We tell you He is risen again ,</l>
       <l n="77">The Lord of Life is risen again ,</l>
       <l n="78">The boughs put forth their tender buds , and Love is Lord of all ! ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="13">
       <l n="79">He bowed his head . He stood so still ,</l>
       <l n="80">They bowed their heads as well .</l>
       <l n="81">And softly from the organ-loft</l>
       <l n="82">The song began to swell .</l>
       <l n="83">Come up with blood-red streamers ,</l>
       <l n="84">The reeds began the strain .</l>
       <l n="85">The vox humana pealed on high ,</l>
       <l n="86">The Spring is risen again !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="14">
       <l n="87">The vox angelica replied — The shadows flee away !</l>
       <l n="88">Our house-beams were of cedar . Come in , with boughs of may !</l>
       <l n="89">The diapason deepened it — Before the darkness fall ,</l>
       <l n="90">We tell you He is risen again !</l>
       <l n="91">Our God hath burst His prison again !</l>

       <l n="3">Our prayers had made the Unchanging yield .</l>
       <l n="4">Caprice was king from depth to height .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="5">On Beachy Head a shouting throng</l>
       <l n="6">Had fired a beacon to proclaim</l>
       <l n="7">Their licence . With unmeasured song</l>
       <l n="8">They proved it , dancing in the flame .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="9">They quarrelled . One desired the sun ,</l>
       <l n="10">And one desired the stars to shine .</l>
       <l n="11">They closed and wrestled and burned as one ,</l>

       <l n="1">A great while ago , there was a school-boy .</l>
       <l n="2">He lived in a cottage by the sea .</l>
       <l n="3">And the very first thing he could remember</l>

       <l n="15">And the skate the skipper kept because he liked ‘ em ,</l>

       <l n="1">O to creep in by candle-light ,</l>
       <l n="2">When all the world is fast asleep ,</l>
       <l n="3">Out of the cold winds , out of the night ,</l>

       <l n="5">O , to creep in , lifting the latch</l>
       <l n="6">So quietly that no soul could hear ,</l>
       <l n="7">And , at those embers in the gloom ,</l>
       <l n="8">Quietly light one careful match —</l>
       <l n="9">You should not hear it , have no fear —</l>
       <l n="10">And light the candle and look round</l>
       <l n="11">The old familiar room ;</l>
       <l n="12">To see the old books upon the wall</l>
       <l n="13">And lovingly take one down again ,</l>
       <l n="14">And hear — O , strange to those that lay</l>
       <l n="15">So patiently underground —</l>
       <l n="16">The ticking of the clock , the sound</l>
       <l n="17">Of clicking embers ...</l>
       <l n="18">watch the play</l>
       <l n="19">Of shadows ...</l>

       <l n="22">And , or ever we go , we lift and kiss</l>
       <l n="23">Some idle thing that your hands may touch ,</l>
       <l n="24">Some paper or book that your hands let fall ,</l>
       <l n="25">And we never — when living — had cared so much</l>
       <l n="26">As to glance upon twice ...</l>
       <l n="27">But now , O bliss</l>
       <l n="28">To kiss and to cherish it , moaning our pain ,</l>
       <l n="29">Ere we creep to the silence again .</l>

       <l n="21">It is the gods that leave the City ! O , Anthony ,</l>
