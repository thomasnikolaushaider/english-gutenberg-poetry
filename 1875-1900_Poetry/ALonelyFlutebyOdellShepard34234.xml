      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">A little wandering wind went up the hill .</l>
       <l n="2">It had a lonely voice as though it knew</l>
       <l n="3">What it should find before it came to where</l>
       <l n="4">The broken body of him that had been Christ</l>
       <l n="5">Hung in the ruddy glow . A bowshot down</l>
       <l n="6">The bleak rock-shouldered hill the soldiery</l>
       <l n="7">Had piled a fire , and when the searching wind</l>
       <l n="8">Came stronger from the distant sea and dashed</l>
       <l n="9">The shadows and the gleam together , songs</l>
       <l n="10">Of battle and lust were blown along the slope</l>
       <l n="11">Mingled with clash of swords on cuisse and shield .</l>
       <l n="12">But of the women sitting by the cross</l>
       <l n="13">Even she whose life had been as gravely sweet</l>
       <l n="14">And sheltered as a lily 's did not flinch .</l>
       <l n="15">Her face was buried in her shrouding cloak .</l>
       <l n="16">And she who knew too sorrowfully well</l>
       <l n="17">The cruelty and bitterness of life</l>
       <l n="18">Heard not . She sat erect , her shadowy hair</l>
       <l n="19">Blown back along the darkness and her eyes</l>
       <l n="20">That searched the distant spaces of the night</l>
       <l n="21">Splendid and glowing with an inward joy .</l>
       <l n="22">And at the darkest hour came three or four</l>
       <l n="23">From round the fire and would have driven them thence ;</l>
       <l n="24">But one who knew them , gazing in their eyes ,</l>
       <l n="25">Said : “ Nay . It is his mother and his love ,</l>
       <l n="26">The scarlet Magdalena . Let them be . ”</l>
       <l n="27">So , in the gloom beside that glimmering cross ,</l>
       <l n="28">Beneath the broken body of him they loved ,</l>
       <l n="29">They wept and watched — the lily and the rose .</l>

       <l n="36">How it might feel to be so very weak ...</l>
       <l n="37">To be a tender lily of the field ,</l>
       <l n="38">To be a lamb lost in the windy hills</l>
       <l n="39">Far from the fold and from the shepherd 's voice ,</l>
       <l n="40">To be a child with no strength , only love .</l>
       <l n="41">And ah , he knew , if ever a man can know ,</l>
       <l n="42">What ‘ t is to be a woman and to live ,</l>
       <l n="43">Strive how she may to out-soar and overcome ,</l>

       <l n="226">Tall and elate she stood , her shadowy hair</l>
       <l n="227">Blown back along the darkness and her eyes</l>
       <l n="228">That searched the distant spaces of the night</l>
       <l n="229">Splendid and glowing with an inward joy .</l>
       <l n="230">And over that dark hill of tragedy</l>
       <l n="231">And triumph , victory and dull despair ,</l>
       <l n="232">Over the sleeping Roman soldiery ,</l>
       <l n="233">Over the three stark crosses and the two</l>
       <l n="234">Who loved Him most , the lily and the rose ,</l>
       <l n="235">Shone still and clear the great compassionate stars .</l>
