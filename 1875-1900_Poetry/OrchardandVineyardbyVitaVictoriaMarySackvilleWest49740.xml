    <head>MARIANA IN THE NORTH</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">ALL her youth is gone , her beautiful youth outworn ,</l>
     <l n="2">Daughter of tarn and tor , the moors that were once her home</l>
     <l n="3">No longer know her step on the upland tracks forlorn</l>
     <l n="4">Where she was wont to roam .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">All her hounds are dead , her beautiful hounds are dead ,</l>
     <l n="6">That paced beside the hoofs of her high and nimble horse ,</l>
     <l n="7">Or streaked in lean pursuit of the tawny hare that fled</l>
     <l n="8">Out of the yellow gorse .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">All her lovers have passed , her beautiful lovers have passed ,</l>
     <l n="10">The young and eager men that fought for her arrogant hand ,</l>
     <l n="11">And the only voice which endures to mourn for her at the last</l>
     <l n="12">Is the voice of the lonely land .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">SORROW OF DEPARTURE . For D .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="14">HE sat among the shadows lost ,</l>
     <l n="15">And heard the careless voice speak on</l>
     <l n="16">Of life when he was gone from home ,</l>
     <l n="17">Of days that he had made his own ,</l>
     <l n="18">Familiar schemes that he had known ,</l>
     <l n="19">And dates that he had cherished most</l>
     <l n="20">As star-points in the year to come ,</l>
     <l n="21">And he was suddenly alone ,</l>
     <l n="22">Thinking ( not bitterly ,</l>
     <l n="23">But with a grave regret ) that he</l>
     <l n="24">Was in that room a ghost .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="25">He sat among the shades apart ,</l>
     <l n="26">The careless voice he scarcely heard .</l>
     <l n="27">In that arrested hour there stirred</l>
     <l n="28">Shy birds of beauty in his heart .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="29">The clouds of March he would not see</l>
     <l n="30">Across the sky race royally ,</l>
     <l n="31">Nor yet the drift of daffodil</l>
     <l n="32">He planted with so glad a hand ,</l>
     <l n="33">Nor yet the loveliness he planned</l>
     <l n="34">For summer ’ s sequence to fulfil ,</l>
     <l n="35">Nor trace upon the hill</l>
     <l n="36">The annual waking of the land ,</l>
     <l n="37">Nor meditative stand</l>
     <l n="38">To watch the turning of the mill .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="39">He would not pause above the Weald</l>
     <l n="40">With twilight falling dim ,</l>
     <l n="41">And mark the chequer-board of field ,</l>
     <l n="42">The water gleaming like a shield ,</l>
     <l n="43">The oast-house in the elms concealed ,</l>
     <l n="44">Nor see , from heaven ’ s chalice-rim ,</l>
     <l n="45">The vintaged sunset brim ,</l>
     <l n="46">Nor yet the high , suspended star</l>
     <l n="47">Hanging eternally afar .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="48">These things would be , but not for him .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="49">At summer noon he would not lie</l>
     <l n="50">One with his cutter ’ s rise and dip ,</l>
     <l n="51">Free with the wind and sea and sky ,</l>
     <l n="52">And watch the dappled waves go by ,</l>
     <l n="53">The sea-gulls scream and slip ;</l>
     <l n="54">White sails , white birds , white clouds , white foam ,</l>
     <l n="55">White cliffs that curled the love of home</l>
     <l n="56">Around him like a whip ....</l>
     <l n="57">He would not see that summer noon</l>
     <l n="58">Fade into dusk from light ,</l>
     <l n="59">While he on shifting waters bright</l>
     <l n="60">Sailed idly on , beneath the moon</l>
     <l n="61">Climbing the dome of night .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="62">This was his dream of happy things</l>
     <l n="63">That he had loved through many springs ,</l>
     <l n="64">And never more might know .</l>
     <l n="65">But man must pass the shrouded gate</l>
     <l n="66">Companioned by his secret fate ,</l>
     <l n="67">And he must lonely go ,</l>
     <l n="68">And none can help or understand ,</l>
     <l n="69">For other men may touch his hand ,</l>
     <l n="70">But none the soul below .</l>
    </lg>
    <p>SCORN</p>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="71">THEY roll , clan by clan , kin by kin , on wide orderly roads ,</l>
     <l n="72">Burghers and citizens all , in a stately procession ,</l>
     <l n="73">Driving before them the wealth of their worldly possession ,</l>
     <l n="74">Cattle , and horses , and pack-mules with sumptuous loads .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="75">In velvet and fur and fat pearls ,— rich lustre and sheen ,</l>
     <l n="76">Paunches and plenty , and fatuous voices contented</l>
     <l n="77">Counting their gain , and their women all jewelled and scented</l>
     <l n="78">Smiling false smiles with the little sharp word in between .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="79">But those in the by-paths of vagrancy , star-gazers , they ,</l>
     <l n="80">Ragged and feckless and young , with no thought but their singing ,</l>
     <l n="81">Derisive of gain , and light as the bird in its winging ,</l>
     <l n="82">Stopping to kiss or to frolic , the simple and gay ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="83">God ’ s fools ,— the belovèd of God who made them and the wind ,</l>
     <l n="84">Gipsies and wastrels of life , the heedless of warning ,</l>
     <l n="85">Chasing the butterfly now on the breeze of the morning ,</l>
     <l n="86">Laugh at the passing procession that leaves them behind .</l>
    </lg>
    <p>DISSONANCE</p>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="87">CLAMOUR has riven us , clamour and din .</l>
     <l n="88">My hand reaches blindly out for your hand , but within</l>
     <l n="89">My mind cannot reach to your mind , because of the clamour and din .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="90">Clang as of brass , an uproar that will not cease .</l>
     <l n="91">I would take from the strangest god or devil the gift of peace .</l>
     <l n="92">If the strife that divides us were suddenly stilled and would cease</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="93">I could come to you , come under washed void skies ,</l>
     <l n="94">My thought in your thought embraced , my eyes and your eyes</l>
     <l n="95">Levelly meeting without the quick faltering of disguise .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="19">
     <l n="96">But all is a harshness and rack where in vain</l>
     <l n="97">We strive through the grossness of flesh to discover our souls again ,</l>
     <l n="98">And the closer we clasp one another , the further apart remain .</l>
    </lg>
    <p>ON THE STATUE OF A VESTAL VIRGIN BY TOMA ROSANDIĆ</p>
    <lg type="stanza" n="20">
     <l n="99">HOW slender , simple , shy , divinely chaste ,</l>
     <l n="100">She wilting stood ,</l>
     <l n="101">Her suppleness at pause , by leisure graced ,</l>
     <l n="102">In robes archaic by the chisel woo ’ d ,</l>
     <l n="103">That smoothly flowed around her waist</l>
     <l n="104">And all her figure traced ,</l>
     <l n="105">And at her feet in fluid ripples broke ;</l>
     <l n="106">A Vestal virgin ! but she rather seemed</l>
     <l n="107">The Hamadryad of the sculpted oak</l>
     <l n="108">Since in that oaken raiment she for ever dreamed .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="21">
     <l n="109">One finger to her lips she raised ,</l>
     <l n="110">And turned her dubious glances wide</l>
     <l n="111">As one who forward to the future gazed ,</l>
     <l n="112">But her reluctant body swerved away</l>
     <l n="113">As one who held her bounty back with pride .</l>
     <l n="114">“ Forbear !” her hesitation seemed to say ,</l>
     <l n="115">While her exulting soul for instant capture cried .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="22">
     <l n="116">And she was ageless ; leisure unperturbed</l>
     <l n="117">Lay like a light across her brow</l>
     <l n="118">And sanctified her vow ;</l>
     <l n="119">But that uplifted hand from its austerity</l>
     <l n="120">Another spirit stirred ,</l>
     <l n="121">Spirit of grace , spirit of fantasy ,</l>
     <l n="122">The wayward spirit of the pagan tree .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="23">
     <l n="123">Had she stood dreaming by the water ’ s verge ,</l>
     <l n="124">Her branches mirrored in the forest pool</l>
     <l n="125">Where plashing sunlight flickered and was cool ?</l>
     <l n="126">Did she so stand</l>
     <l n="127">Before the sculptor with his mortal hand</l>
     <l n="128">Summoned the mortal maiden to emerge ?</l>
     <l n="129">And did she open eyes upon a place</l>
     <l n="130">All pied and jewelled with the flowers wild ,</l>
     <l n="131">With king-cups and the pretty daisy mild ,</l>
     <l n="132">With periwinkle sulking like a child ,</l>
     <l n="133">And little orchis with his puckered face ,</l>
     <l n="134">And campion too ?</l>
     <l n="135">Did these , when first they saw her , race</l>
     <l n="136">Around her feet like tiny rivulets ?</l>
     <l n="137">The bluebells shake for joy ? the violets ,</l>
     <l n="138">Thinking that other Virgin full of grace</l>
     <l n="139">Was come amongst them , blush a deeper blue ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="24">
     <l n="140">Was this her birth upon a world of men ,</l>
     <l n="141">Where any painter might have seized his hour ,</l>
     <l n="142">Breathing her swiftly on the canvas then ,</l>
     <l n="143">Among the lowly flowers a taller flower ?</l>
     <l n="144">Or any sculptor on the marble limn</l>
     <l n="145">Her slenderness serene , her beauty ’ s dower ,</l>
     <l n="146">Her lifted hand , her smooth and fragile limb ,</l>
     <l n="147">Learning a greater art from her than she from him ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="25">
     <l n="148">So in the prison of her perfect shape</l>
     <l n="149">She dwelt for ever virginal , adored ,</l>
     <l n="150">Whence she might never know escape ,</l>
     <l n="151">Might never know what mystery lay stored</l>
     <l n="152">Beyond the threshold she might never pass ,</l>
     <l n="153">But where for ever poised and wavering she was ,</l>
     <l n="154">Threshold of waking youth , as bright and narrow as a sword .</l>
    </lg>
    <p>TRIO</p>
    <lg type="stanza" n="26">
     <l n="155">SO well she knew them both ! yet as she came</l>
     <l n="156">Into the room , and heard their speech</l>
     <l n="157">Of tragic meshes knotted with her name ,</l>
     <l n="158">And saw them , foes , but meeting each with each</l>
     <l n="159">Closer than friends , souls bared through enmity ,</l>
     <l n="160">Beneath their startled gaze she thought that she</l>
     <l n="161">Broke as the stranger on their conference ,</l>
     <l n="162">And left them as she stole abashed from thence .</l>
    </lg>
    <p>ARIANE</p>
    <lg type="stanza" n="27">
     <l n="163">I wish you thought me faithless , when within</l>

     <l n="165">I wish that I might tell you fables blithe</l>

   <p>BEFORE AND AFTER</p>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>BEFORE</head>
     <l n="1">I wait your coming as a miracle ,</l>
     <l n="2">And the expectant morning waits with me ;</l>
     <l n="3">Time hangs suspended as a quiet bell</l>
     <l n="4">That once did strike the hours successively ,</l>
     <l n="5">For over all the country lies a spell ,</l>
     <l n="6">A hush , a painted stillness , where I see</l>
     <l n="7">( As calm as skies reflected in a well )</l>
     <l n="8">The fields enchanted , waiting silently .</l>
   </lg>
   <lg type="poem">

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">OH , heart ! the beauty of your wind-swept hair</l>
     <l n="2">Blown from your temples as you swiftly came !</l>
     <l n="3">For all the pagan grace of you was there ,</l>
     <l n="4">Remembered , ardent , after months the same .</l>
     <l n="5">The eager muscles of your throat were bare ,</l>
     <l n="6">The candid passion lit you like a flame ,</l>
     <l n="7">As , striving on against the countering air ,</l>
     <l n="8">You reached me , failing , breathing out my name .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">JOY have I had of life this vigorous day</l>
     <l n="2">Since sunrise when I took the wealden way ,</l>
     <l n="3">And my fair country as I rapid strode</l>
     <l n="4">Lay round the turn of the familiar road</l>
     <l n="5">In mists diaphanous as seas in foam .</l>

     <l n="9">The soft air winnowing</l>
     <l n="10">The thistledown that blew along the hedge .</l>
     <l n="11">A little moorhen rippled in the sedge ;</l>
     <l n="12">A distant sheep-dog barked ; the day was still ,</l>

     <l n="1">THERE travelled north from Kurdistan along the lone Siberian trails</l>
     <l n="2">A merchant with his caravan and Eastern barter in his bales .</l>
     <l n="3">He rode ahead , he rode apart , the city of Irkutsk his goal ,</l>
     <l n="4">Upon his lean Circassian foal , and after came the lumbering cart</l>
     <l n="5">With creaking wheel , deliberate spoke , and water-bullocks in the yoke ;</l>
     <l n="6">And after these in single string the boorish camels following ,</l>
     <l n="7">Slouching with high unwieldy packs like howdahs piled upon their backs ;</l>
     <l n="8">With slaver hanging from their lips and hatred worming in their brain</l>
     <l n="9">They slouched beneath their drivers ’ whips across the white and</l>
     <l n="10">mournful plain .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="11">The merchant riding on alone saw not the white incessant snow ,</l>
     <l n="12">He only saw the metal ’ s glow , the colour of the precious stone ;</l>
     <l n="13">He lingered on the merchandise that he had brought from Kurdistan ,</l>
     <l n="14">And turned , and swept his caravan with doting and voluptuous eyes ,</l>
     <l n="15">For there were choice Bokhara rugs , and daggers with Damascus blade</l>
     <l n="16">And hafts of turquoise-studded jade , and phials rich with scented drugs ,</l>
     <l n="17">Koràns inscribed on ass ’ s skin , and bales of silk from Temesvàr ,</l>
     <l n="18">And silver ear-rings beaten thin , and bargains from the cool bazaar .</l>

     <l n="19">He felt the gold already pouched , he crooned to it with horrid love ,</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="21">For thirty days the caravan trailed on behind the merchant ’ s foal ,</l>
     <l n="22">Through Persia and through Turkestan , the city of Irkutsk their goal ;</l>
     <l n="23">They passed the fruitful hill-girt lands where dwelt the fair-skinned</l>
     <l n="24">Grecian race ,</l>
     <l n="25">And came into the wilder place , and sighted vagrant Cossack bands</l>
     <l n="26">That wandered with their flocks and herds , and trafficked with the</l>
     <l n="27">train of Kurds ;</l>
     <l n="28">They stirred the ghost of Tamerlane , who swept that way with Tartar</l>
     <l n="29">hordes ,</l>
     <l n="30">The ghosts of dead barbarian lords , the Asiatic hurricane ;</l>
     <l n="31">They crossed the mighty road that runs from Moscow through to</l>
     <l n="32">China ’ s wall ,</l>
     <l n="33">And trod the path of nomad Huns and knew Siberia ’ s white pall</l>
     <l n="34">When fields of Persian asphodel were visions of a distant day</l>
     <l n="35">And boundless snow around them lay , and noiseless snow for ever fell ,</l>
     <l n="36">Where soon the fleeting day was done , and on the hard horizon low</l>
     <l n="37">They saw the scarlet ball of sun divided by the ridge of snow</l>
     <l n="38">Sink down in skies incarnadine ; and still with their disjointed gait</l>
     <l n="39">And nursing their malignant hate , the camels kept unbroken line .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="40">When yet a hundred miles or more stretched out between them and their goal</l>
     <l n="41">The merchant riding on before drew rein on his Circassian foal</l>

     <l n="43">Each night since the monotony began with that unvaried land .</l>
     <l n="44">The dusk was suddenly alive as shouting voices passed the word ,</l>
     <l n="45">And all the drowsy train was stirred with movement like a shaken hive .</l>
     <l n="46">The master merchant stiff from cramp was calling for his saddle flask ,</l>
     <l n="47">As each to his accustomed task ran swiftly in the growing camp .</l>
     <l n="48">A tent like an inverted bell , all scarlet with the dyes of Tyre ,</l>
     <l n="49">Was lifted rapidly and well , and like a torch the kindled fire</l>
     <l n="50">Destroyed the night with leaping tongue , and in a circle round the glow</l>
     <l n="51">Men shovelled back the melting snow , and skins and Khelim rugs</l>
     <l n="52">were flung —</l>
     <l n="53">And unforgotten were the needs of water-bullocks standing by</l>
     <l n="54">Whose brows are stained with orange dye , whose horns are looped</l>
     <l n="55">with turquoise beads .</l>
     <l n="56">The pariah dogs that slink and prowl secured their meat with</l>
     <l n="57">furtive growl ,</l>
     <l n="58">And one by one the camels bent complaining to their warty knees</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="61">The merchant brooded silently on avaricious visions bright</l>

     <l n="103">And swore he could not see aright , and rubbed his eyes and stared again ;</l>

     <l n="105">With necks outstretched and swaying head and mouths all slackly</l>
     <l n="106">slobbering ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">LYING on Downs above the wrinkling bay</l>
     <l n="2">I with the kestrels shared the cleanly day ,</l>
     <l n="3">The candid day ; wind-shaven , brindled turf ;</l>
     <l n="4">Tall cliffs ; and long sea-line of marbled surf</l>
     <l n="5">From Cornish Lizard to the Kentish Nore</l>
     <l n="6">Lipping the bulwarks of the English shore ,</l>
     <l n="7">While many a lovely ship below sailed by</l>
     <l n="8">On unknown errand , kempt and leisurely ;</l>
     <l n="9">And after each , oh , after each , my heart</l>
     <l n="10">Fled forth , as , watching from the Downs apart ,</l>
     <l n="11">I shared with ships good joys and fortunes wide</l>
     <l n="12">That might befall their beauty and their pride ;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="13">Shared first with them the blessèd void repose</l>
     <l n="14">Of oily days at sea , when only rose</l>
     <l n="15">The porpoise ’ s slow wheel to break the sheen</l>
     <l n="16">Of satin water indolently green ,</l>
     <l n="17">When for ’ ard the crew , caps tilted over eyes ,</l>
     <l n="18">Lay heaped on deck ; slept ; murmured ; smoked ; threw dice ;</l>
     <l n="19">The sleepy summer days ; the summer nights</l>
     <l n="20">( The coast pricked out with rings of harbour-lights ) ,</l>
     <l n="21">The motionless nights , the vaulted nights of June</l>
     <l n="22">When high in the cordage drifts the entangled moon ,</l>
     <l n="23">And blocks go knocking , and the sheets go slapping ,</l>
     <l n="24">And lazy swells against the sides come lapping ;</l>
     <l n="25">And summer mornings off red Devon rocks ,</l>
     <l n="26">Faint inland bells at dawn and crowing cocks .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="27">Shared swifter days , when headlands into ken</l>
     <l n="28">Trod grandly ; threatened ; and were lost again ,</l>
     <l n="29">Old fangs along the battlemented coast ;</l>
     <l n="30">And followed still my ship , when winds were most</l>
     <l n="31">Night-purified , and , lying steeply over ,</l>
     <l n="32">She fled the wind as flees a girl her lover ,</l>
     <l n="33">Quickened by that pursuit for which she fretted ,</l>
     <l n="34">Her temper by the contest proved and whetted ;</l>
     <l n="35">Wild stars swept overhead ; her lofty spars</l>
     <l n="36">Reared to a ragged heaven sown with stars</l>
     <l n="37">As leaping out from narrow English ease</l>
     <l n="38">She faced the roll of long Atlantic seas ;</l>

     <l n="39">Her captain then was I , I was her crew ,</l>

     <l n="42">Nay , I was more : I was her very sails</l>
     <l n="43">Rounded before the wind , her eager keel ,</l>
     <l n="44">Her straining mast-heads , her responsive wheel ,</l>
     <l n="45">Her pennon stiffened like a swallow ’ s wing ;</l>
     <l n="46">Yes , I was all her slope and speed and swing ,</l>
     <l n="47">Whether by yellow lemons and blue sea</l>
     <l n="48">She dawdled through the isles off Thessaly ,</l>
     <l n="49">Or saw the palms like sheaves of scimitars</l>
     <l n="50">On desert ’ s verge below the sunset bars ,</l>
     <l n="51">Or passed the girdle of the planet where</l>
     <l n="52">The Southern Cross looks over to the Bear ,</l>
     <l n="53">And strayed , cool Northerner beneath strange skies ,</l>
     <l n="54">Flouting the lure of tropic estuaries ,</l>
     <l n="55">Down that long coast , and saw Magellan ’ s Clouds arise .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="56">And some that beat up Channel homeward-bound</l>
     <l n="57">I watched , and wondered what they might have found ,</l>
     <l n="58">What alien ports enriched their teeming hold</l>
     <l n="59">With crates of fruit or bars of unwrought gold ?</l>
     <l n="60">And thought how London clerks with paper-clips</l>
     <l n="61">Had filed the bills of lading of those ships ,</l>
     <l n="62">Clerks that had never seen the embattled sea ,</l>
     <l n="63">But wrote down jettison and barratry ,</l>
     <l n="64">Perils , Adventures , and the Act of God ,</l>
     <l n="65">Having no vision of such wrath flung broad ;</l>
     <l n="66">Wrote down with weary and accustomed pen</l>
     <l n="67">The classic dangers of sea-faring men ;</l>
     <l n="68">And wrote “ Restraint of Princes ,” and “ the acts</l>
     <l n="69">Of the King ’ s Enemies ,” as vacant facts ,</l>
     <l n="70">Blind to the ambushed seas , the encircling roar</l>
     <l n="71">Of angry nations foaming into war .</l>
