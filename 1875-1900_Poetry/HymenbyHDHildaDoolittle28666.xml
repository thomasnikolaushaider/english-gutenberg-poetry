    <docDate>NEW YORK HENRY HOLT AND COMPANY<date>1921</date>FOR BRYHER AND PERDITA They said : she is high and far and blind in her high pride , but now that my head is bowed in sorrow , I find she is most kind . We have taken life , they said , blithely , not groped in a mist for things that are not — are if you will , but bloodless — why ask happiness of the dead ? and my heart bled . Ah , could they know how violets throw strange fire , red and purple and gold , how they glow gold and purple and red where her feet tread .</docDate>

     <p>As from a temple service , tall and dignified , with slow pace , each a queen , the sixteen matrons from the temple of Hera pass before the curtain — a dark purple hung between Ionic columns — of the porch or open hall of a palace . Their hair is bound as the marble hair of the temple Hera . Each wears a crown or diadem of gold .</p>
     <p>They sing — the music is temple music , deep , simple , chanting notes :</p>
     <lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">From the closed garden</l>
       <l n="2">Where our feet pace</l>
       <l n="3">Back and forth each day ,</l>
       <l n="4">This gladiolus white ,</l>
       <l n="5">This red , this purple spray —</l>
       <l n="6">Gladiolus tall with dignity</l>
       <l n="7">As yours , lady — we lay</l>
       <l n="8">Before your feet and pray :</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="9">Of all the blessings —</l>
       <l n="10">Youth , joy , ecstasy —</l>
       <l n="11">May one gift last</l>
       <l n="12">( As the tall gladiolus may</l>
       <l n="13">Outlast the wind-flower ,</l>
       <l n="14">Winter-rose or rose ) ,</l>
       <l n="15">One gift above ,</l>
       <l n="16">Encompassing all those ;</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="17">For her , for him ,</l>
       <l n="18">For all within these palace walls ,</l>
       <l n="19">Beyond the feast ,</l>
       <l n="20">Beyond the cry of Hymen and the torch ,</l>
       <l n="21">Beyond the night and music</l>
       <l n="22">Echoing through the porch till day .</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>The music , with its deep chanting notes , dies away . The curtain hangs motionless in rich , full folds . Then from this background of darkness , dignity and solemn repose , a flute gradually detaches itself , becomes clearer and clearer , pipes alone one shrill , simple little melody .</p>
     <p>From the distance , four children 's voices blend with the flute , and four very little girls pass singly before the curtain , small maids or attendants of the sixteen matrons . Their hair is short and curls at the back of their heads like the hair of the chryselephantine Hermes . They sing :</p>
     <lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">Where the first crocus buds unfold</l>
       <l n="2">We found these petals near the cold</l>
       <l n="3">Swift river-bed .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="4">Beneath the rocks where ivy-frond</l>
       <l n="5">Puts forth new leaves to gleam beyond</l>
       <l n="6">Those lately dead :</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="7">The very smallest two or three</l>
       <l n="8">Of gold ( gold pale as ivory )</l>
       <l n="9">We gatherèd .</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>When the little girls have passed before the curtain , a wood-wind weaves a richer note into the flute melody ; then the two blend into one song . But as the wood-wind grows in mellowness and richness , the flute gradually dies away into a secondary theme and the wood-wind alone evolves the melody of a new song .</p>
     <p>Two by two — like two sets of medallions with twin profiles distinct , one head slightly higher , bent forward a little — the four figures of four slight , rather fragile taller children , are outlined with sharp white contour against the curtain .</p>
     <p>The hair is smooth against the heads , falling to the shoulders but slightly waved against the nape of the neck . They are looking down , each at a spray of winter-rose . The tunics fall to the knees in sharp marble folds . They sing :</p>
     <lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">Never more will the wind</l>
       <l n="2">Cherish you again ,</l>
       <l n="3">Never more will the rain .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="4">Never more</l>
       <l n="5">Shall we find you bright</l>
       <l n="6">In the snow and wind .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="7">The snow is melted ,</l>
       <l n="8">The snow is gone ,</l>
       <l n="9">And you are flown :</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="10">Like a bird out of our hand ,</l>
       <l n="11">Like a light out of our heart ,</l>
       <l n="12">You are gone .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="13">As the wistful notes of the wood-wind gradually die away , there comes a</l>
       <l n="14">sudden , shrill , swift piping .</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>Free and wild , like the wood-maidens of Artemis , is this last group of four — very straight with heads tossed back . They sing in rich , free , swift notes . They move swiftly before the curtain in contrast to the slow , important pace of the first two groups . Their hair is loose and rayed out like that of the sun-god . They are boyish in shape and gesture . They carry hyacinths in baskets , strapped like quivers to their backs . They reach to draw the flower sprays from the baskets , as the Huntress her arrows .</p>
     <p>As they dart swiftly to and fro before the curtain , they are youth , they are spring — they are the Chelidonia , their song is the swallow-song of joy :</p>
     <lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">Between the hollows</l>
       <l n="2">Of the little hills</l>
       <l n="3">The spring spills blue —</l>
       <l n="4">Turquoise , sapphire , lapis-lazuli</l>
       <l n="5">On a brown cloth outspread .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="6">Ah see ,</l>
       <l n="7">How carefully we lay them now ,</l>
       <l n="8">Each hyacinth spray ,</l>
       <l n="9">Across the marble floor —</l>
       <l n="10">A pattern your bent eyes</l>
       <l n="11">May trace and follow</l>
       <l n="12">To the shut bridal door .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="13">Lady , our love , our dear ,</l>
       <l n="14">Our bride most fair ,</l>
       <l n="15">They grew among the hollows</l>
       <l n="16">Of the hills ;</l>
       <l n="17">As if the sea had spilled its blue ,</l>
       <l n="18">As if the sea had risen</l>
       <l n="19">From its bed ,</l>
       <l n="20">And sinking to the level of the shore ,</l>
       <l n="21">Left hyacinths on the floor .</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>There is a pause . Flute , pipe and wood-wind blend in a full , rich movement . There is no definite melody but full , powerful rhythm like soft but steady wind above forest trees . Into this , like rain , gradually creeps the note of strings .</p>
     <p>As the strings grow stronger and finally dominate the whole , the bride-chorus passes before the curtain . There may be any number in this chorus . The figures — tall young women , clothed in long white tunics — follow one another closely , yet are all distinct like a procession of a temple frieze .</p>
     <p>The bride in the center is not at first distinguishable from her maidens ; but as they begin their song , the maidens draw apart into two groups , leaving the veiled symbolic figure standing alone in the center .</p>
     <p>The two groups range themselves to right and left like officiating priestesses . The veiled figure stands with her back against the curtain , the others being in profile . Her head is swathed in folds of diaphanous white , through which the features are visible , like the veiled Tanagra .</p>
     <p>When the song is finished , the group to the bride 's left turns about ; also the bride , so that all face in one direction . In processional form they pass out , the figure of the bride again merging , not distinguishable from the maidens .</p>

     <p>Four tall young women , very young matrons , enter in a group . They stand clear and fair , but this little group entirely lacks the austere precision of the procession of maidens just preceding them . They pause in the center of the stage ; turn , one three-quarter , two in profile and the fourth full face ; they stand , turned as if confiding in each other like a Tanagra group .</p>
     <p>They sing lightly , their flower trays under their arms .</p>

      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="10">Here in our wicker-trays ,</l>

       <l n="13">Lady , their blushes shine</l>

       <l n="17">The sun shines through ,</l>

      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>The harp chords become again more regular in simple definite rhythm . The music is not so intense as the bride-chorus ; and quieter , more sedate , than the notes preceding the entrance of the last group .</p>
     <p>Five or six slightly older serene young women enter in processional form ; each holding before her , with precise bending of arms , coverlets and linen , carefully folded , as if for the bride couch . The garments are purple , scarlet and deep blue , with edge of gold .</p>
     <p>They sing to blending of wood-wind and harp .</p>
     <lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">

      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>The wood-winds become more rich and resonant . A tall youth crosses the stage as if seeking the bride door . The music becomes very rich , full of color .</p>
     <p>The figure itself is a flame , an exaggerated symbol ; the hair a flame ; the wings , deep red or purple , stand out against the curtains in a contrasting or almost clashing shade of purple . The tunic , again a rich purple or crimson , falls almost to the knees . The knees are bare ; the sandals elaborately strapped over and over . The curtain seems a rich purple cloud , the figure , still brighter , like a flamboyant bird , half emerged in the sunset .</p>
     <p>Love pauses just outside the bride 's door with his gift , a tuft of black-purple cyclamen . He sings to the accompaniment of wood-winds , in a rich , resonant voice :</p>
     <lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">The crimson cover of her bed</l>

       <l n="20">( Ah , rare her shoulders drawing back ! )</l>
       <l n="21">One moment , then the plunderer slips</l>

     <p>A band of boys passes before the curtain . They pass from side to side , crossing and re-crossing ; but their figures never confuse one another , the outlines are never blurred . They stand out against the curtain with symbolic gesture , stooping as if to gather up the wreaths , or swaying with long stiff branch as if to sweep the fallen petals from the floor .</p>
     <p>There is no marked melody from the instruments , but the boys ’ voices , humming lightly as they enter , gradually evolve a little dance song . There are no words but the lilt up and down of the boys ’ tenor voices .</p>
     <p>Then , as if they had finished the task of gathering up the wreaths and sweeping the petals , they stand in groups of two before the pillars where the torches have been placed . They lift the torches from the brackets . They hold them aloft between them , one torch to each two boys . Their figures are cut against the curtain like the simple , triangular design on the base of a vase or frieze — the boys ’ heads on a level , the torches above them .</p>
     <p>They sing in clear , half-subdued voices .</p>

     <p>At the end of the song , the torches flicker out and the figures are no longer distinguishable in the darkness . They pass out like shadows . The purple curtain hangs black and heavy .</p>
     <p>The music dies away and is finally cut short with a few deep , muted chords .</p>

      <head>I</head>
     <p>Men , fires , feasts , steps of temple , fore-stone , lintel , step of white altar , fire and after-fire , slaughter before , fragment of burnt meat , deep mystery , grapple of mind to reach the tense thought , power and wealth , purpose and prayer alike , ( men , fires , feasts , temple steps ) — useless .</p>
     <p>Useless to me who plant wide feet on a mighty plinth , useless to me who sit , wide of shoulder , great of thigh , heavy in gold , to press gold back against solid back of the marble seat : useless the dragons wrought on the arms , useless the poppy-buds and the gold inset of the spray of wheat .</p>
     <p>Ah they have wrought me heavy and great of limb — she is slender of waist , slight of breast , made of many fashions ; they have set her small feet on many a plinth ; she they have known , she they have spoken with , she they have smiled upon , she they have caught and flattered with praise and gifts .</p>
     <p>But useless the flattery of the mighty power they have granted me : for I will not stay in her breast the great of limb , though perfect the shell they have fashioned me , these men !</p>
     <p>Do I sit in the market place — do I smile , does a noble brow bend like the brow of Zeus — am I a spouse , his or any , am I a woman , or goddess or queen , to be met by a god with a smile — and left ?</p>
     <p>II</p>
     <p>Do you ask for a scroll , parchment , oracle , prophecy , precedent ; do you ask for tablets marked with thought or words cut deep on the marble surface , do you seek measured utterance or the mystic trance ?</p>
     <p>Sleep on the stones of Delphi — dare the ledges of Pallas but keep me foremost , keep me before you , after you , with you , never forget when you start for the Delphic precipice , never forget when you seek Pallas and meet in thought yourself drawn out from yourself like the holy serpent , never forget in thought or mysterious trance — I am greatest and least .</p>
     <p>Soft are the hands of Love , soft , soft are his feet ; you who have twined myrtle , have you brought crocuses , white as the inner stript bark of the osier , have you set black crocus against the black locks of another ?</p>

     <p>Many the children of gods but first I take Bromios , fostering prince , lift from the ivy brake , a king .</p>
     <p>Enough of the lightning , enough of the tales that speak of the death of the mother : strange tales of a shelter brought to the unborn , enough of tale , myth , mystery , precedent — a child lay on the earth asleep .</p>
     <p>Soft are the hands of Love , but what soft hands clutched at the thorny ground , scratched like a small white ferret or foraging whippet or hound , sought nourishment and found only the crackling of ivy , dead ivy leaf and the white berry , food for a bird , no food for this who sought , bending small head in a fever , whining with little breath .</p>
     <p>Ah , small black head , ah , the purple ivy bush , ah , berries that shook and spilt on the form beneath , who begot you and left ?</p>
     <p>Though I begot no man child all my days , the child of my heart and spirit , is the child the gods desert alike and the mother in death — the unclaimed Dionysios .</p>

     <p>Form of a golden wreath were my hands that girt her head , fingers that strove to meet , and met where the whisps escaped from the fillet , of tenderest gold , small circlet and slim were my fingers then .</p>
     <p>Now they are wrought of iron to wrest from earth secrets ; strong to protect , strong to keep back the winter when winter tracks too soon blanch the forest : strong to break dead things , the young tree , drained of sap , the old tree , ready to drop , to lift from the rotting bed of leaves , the old crumbling pine tree stock , to heap bole and knot of fir and pine and resinous oak , till fire shatter the dark and hope of spring rise in the hearts of men .</p>
     <p>What of her — mistress of Death — what of his kiss ?</p>
     <p>Ah , strong were his arms to wrest slight limbs from the beautiful earth , young hands that plucked the first buds of the chill narcissus , soft fingers that broke and fastened the thorny stalk with the flower of wild acanthus .</p>
     <p>Ah , strong were the arms that took ( ah evil , the heart and graceless ,) but the kiss was less passionate !</p>

     <p>On the paved parapet you will step carefully from amber stones to onyx flecked with violet , mingled with light , half showing the sea-grass and sea-sand underneath , reflecting your white feet and the gay strap crimson as lily-buds of Arion , and the gold that binds your feet .</p>

     <p>You will pass beneath the island disk ( and myrtle-wood , the carved support of it ) and the white stretch of its white beach , curved as the moon crescent or ivory when some fine hand chisels it : when the sun slips through the far edge , there is rare amber through the sea , and flecks of it glitter on the dolphin 's back and jewelled halter and harness and bit as he sways under it .</p>

     <p>It was easy enough to bend them to my wish , it was easy enough to alter them with a touch , but you adrift on the great sea , how shall I call you back ?</p>
     <p>Cedar and white ash , rock-cedar and sand plants and tamarisk red cedar and white cedar and black cedar from the inmost forest , fragrance upon fragrance and all of my sea-magic is for nought .</p>
     <p>It was easy enough — a thought called them from the sharp edges of the earth ; they prayed for a touch , they cried for the sight of my face , they entreated me till in pity I turned each to his own self .</p>
     <p>Panther and panther , then a black leopard follows close — black panther and red and a great hound , a god-like beast , cut the sand in a clear ring and shut me from the earth , and cover the sea-sound with their throats , and the sea-roar with their own barks and bellowing and snarls , and the sea-stars and the swirl of the sand , and the rock-tamarisk and the wind resonance — but not your voice .</p>
     <p>It is easy enough to call men from the edges of the earth . It is easy enough to summon them to my feet with a thought — it is beautiful to see the tall panther and the sleek deer-hounds circle in the dark .</p>
     <p>It is easy enough to make cedar and white ash fumes into palaces and to cover the sea-caves with ivory and onyx .</p>
     <p>But I would give up rock-fringes of coral and the inmost chamber of my island palace and my own gifts and the whole region of my power and magic for your glance .</p>

     <p>Through the deep purple of the dying heat of sun and mist , the level ray of sun-beam has caressed the lily with dark breast , and flecked with richer gold its golden crest .</p>
     <p>Where the slow lifting of the tide , floats into the river and slowly drifts among the reeds , and lifts the yellow flags , he floats where tide and river meet .</p>

     <p>I worship the feet , flawless , that haunt the hills — ( ah , sweet , dare I think , beneath fetter of golden clasp , of the rhythm , the fall and rise of yours , carven , slight beneath straps of gold that keep their slender beauty caught , like wings and bodies of trapped birds . )</p>
     <p>I worship the greatest first — ( suddenly into my brain — the flash of sun on the snow , the fringe of light and the drift , the crest and the hill-shadow — ah , surely now I forget , ah splendour , my goddess turns : or was it the sudden heat , beneath quivering of molten flesh , of veins , purple as violets ? )</p>

     <head>CUCKOO SONG</head>
     <p>Ah , bird , our love is never spent with your clear note , nor satiate our soul ; not song , not wail , not hurt , but just a call summons us with its simple top-note and soft fall ;</p>
     <p>not to some rarer heaven of lilies over-tall , nor tuberose set against some sun-lit wall , but to a gracious cedar-palace hall ;</p>
     <p>not marble set with purple hung with roses and tall sweet lilies — such as the nightingale would summon for us with her wail — ( surely only unhappiness could thrill such a rich madrigal ! ) not she , the nightingale can fill our souls with such a wistful joy as this :</p>
     <p>nor , bird , so sweet was ever a swallow note — not hers , so perfect with the wing of lazuli and bright breast — nor yet the oriole filling with melody from her fiery throat some island-orchard in a purple sea .</p>
     <p>Ah dear , ah gentle bird , you spread warm length of crimson wool and tinted woven stuff for us to rest upon , nor numb with ecstasy nor drown with death :</p>
     <p>only you soothe , make still the throbbing of our brain : so through her forest trees , when all her hope was gone and all her pain , Calypso heard your call — across the gathering drift of burning cedar-wood , across the low-set bed of wandering parsley and violet , when all her hope was dead .</p>

     <p>But to name you , we reverent are breathless , weak with pain and old loss , and exile and despair — our hearts break but to speak your name , Oknaleos — and may we but call you in the feverish wrack of our storm-strewn beach , Eretmeos , and our hurt is quiet and our hearts tamed , as the sea may yet be tamed , and we vow to float great ships , named for each hero , and oar-blades , cut out of mountain-trees as such men might have shaped : Eretmeos and the sea is swept , baffled by the lordly shape , Akroneos has pines for his ship 's keel ; to love , to mate the sea ? Ah there is Ponteos , the very deeps roar , hailing you dear — they clamour to Ponteos , and to Proeos leap , swift to kiss , to curl , to creep , lover to mistress .</p>
     <p>What wave , what love , what foam , for Ooos who moves swift as the sea ? Ah stay , my heart , the weight of lovers , of loneliness drowns me , alas that their very names so press to break my heart with heart-sick weariness , what would they be , the very gods , rearing their mighty length beside the unharvested sea ?</p>

     <p>Here men are bent with thought and women waste fair moments gathering lint and pricking coloured stuffs to mar their breasts , while she , adored , wastes not her fingers , worn of fire and sword , wastes not her touch on linen and fine thread , wastes not her head in thought and pondering , Love , why have you sought the horde of spearsmen , why the tent Achilles pitched beside the river-ford ?</p>

     <p>So I scatter , so implore Gods of Crete , summoned before with slighter craft ; ah , hear my prayer :</p>
     <p>Grant to my soul the body that it wore , trained to your thought , that kept and held your power , as the petal of black poppy , the opiate of the flower .</p>
     <p>For art undreamt in Crete , strange art and dire , in counter-charm prevents my charm limits my power : pine-cone I heap , grant answer to my prayer .</p>
     <p>No more , my soul — as the black cup , sullen and dark with fire , burns till beside it , noon 's bright heat is withered , filled with dust — and into that noon-heat grown drab and stale , suddenly wind and thunder and swift rain , till the scarlet flower is wrecked in the slash of the white hail .</p>
     <p>The poppy that my heart was , formed to blind all mortals , made to strike and gather hearts like flame upon an altar , fades and shrinks , a red leaf drenched and torn in the cold rain .</p>

     <head>SHE CONTRASTS WITH HERSELF HIPPOLYTA</head>
     <p>Can flame beget white steel — ah no , it could not take within my reins its shelter ; steel must seek steel , or hate make out of joy a whet-stone for a sword ; sword against flint , Theseus sought Hippolyta ; she yielded not nor broke , sword upon stone , from the clash leapt a spark , Hippolytus , born of hate .</p>
     <p>What did she think when all her strength was twisted for his bearing ; did it break , even within her sheltered heart , a song , some whispered note , distant and faint as this :</p>
     <p>Love that I bear within my breast how is my armour melted how my heart : as an oak-tree that keeps beneath the snow , the young bark fresh till the spring cast from off its shoulders the white snow so does my armour melt .</p>
     <p>Love that I bear within my heart , O speak ; tell how beneath the serpent-spotted shell , the cygnets wait , how the soft owl opens and flicks with pride , eye-lids of great bird-eyes , when underneath its breast the owlets shrink and turn .</p>
     <p>You have the power , ( then did she say ) Artemis , benignity to grant forgiveness that I gave no quarter to an enemy who cast his armour on the forest-moss , and took , unmatched in an uneven contest , Hippolyta who relented not , returned and sought no kiss .</p>
     <p>Then did she pray : Artemis , grant that no flower be grafted alien on a broken stalk , no dark flame-laurel on the stricken crest of a wild mountain-poplar ; grant in my thought , I never yield but wait , entreating cold white river , mountain-pool and salt : let all my veins be ice , until they break ( strength of white beach , rock of mountain land , forever to you , Artemis , dedicate ) from out my reins , those small , cold hands .</p>

      <head>SHE REBUKES HIPPOLYTA</head>
       <l n="1">Was she so chaste ?</l>
     </lg>
     <p>Swift and a broken rock clatters across the steep shelf of the mountain slope , sudden and swift and breaks as it clatters down into the hollow breach of the dried water-course : far and away ( through fire I see it , and smoke of the dead , withered stalks of the wild cistus-brush ) Hippolyta , frail and wild , galloping up the slope between great boulder and rock and group and cluster of rock .</p>
     <p>Was she so chaste , ( I see it , sharp , this vision , and each fleck on the horse 's flanks of foam , and bridle and bit , silver , and the straps , wrought with their perfect art , and the sun , striking athwart the silver-work , and the neck , strained forward , ears alert , and the head of a girl flung back and her throat . )</p>
     <p>Was she so chaste — ( Ah , burn my fire , I ask out of the smoke-ringed darkness enclosing the flaming disk of my vision ) I ask for a voice to answer : was she chaste ?</p>
     <p>Who can say — the broken ridge of the hills was the line of a lover 's shoulder , his arm-turn , the path to the hills , the sudden leap and swift thunder of mountain boulders , his laugh .</p>
     <p>She was mad — as no priest , no lover 's cult could grant madness ; the wine that entered her throat with the touch of the mountain rocks was white , intoxicant : she , the chaste , was betrayed by the glint of light on the hills , the granite splinter of rocks , the touch of the stone where heat melts toward the shadow-side of the rocks .</p>

     <head>EGYPT</head>
     <head>( TO E. A. POE )</head>
     <p>Egypt had cheated us , for Egypt took through guile and craft our treasure and our hope , Egypt had maimed us , offered dream for life , an opiate for a kiss , and death for both .</p>
     <p>White poison flower we loved and the black spike of an ungarnered bush — ( a spice — or without taste — we wondered — then we asked others to take and sip and watched their death ) Egypt we loved , though hate should have withheld our touch .</p>
     <p>Egypt had given us knowledge , and we took , blindly , through want of heart , what Egypt brought ; knowing all poison , what was that or this , more or less perilous , than this or that .</p>
     <p>We pray you , Egypt , by what perverse fate , has poison brought with knowledge , given us this — not days of trance , shadow , fore-doom of death , but passionate grave thought , belief enhanced , ritual returned and magic ;</p>
     <p>Even in the uttermost black pit of the forbidden knowledge , wisdom 's glance , the grey eyes following in the mid-most desert — great shaft of rose , fire shed across our path , upon the face grown grey , a light , Hellas re-born from death .</p>

     <head>HELIOS</head>
     <p>Helios makes all things right :— night brands and chokes as if destruction broke over furze and stone and crop of myrtle-shoot and field-wort , destroyed with flakes of iron , the bracken-stems , where tender roots were sown , blight , chaff and waste of darkness to choke and drown .</p>
     <p>A curious god to find , yet in the end faithful ; bitter , the Kyprian 's feet — ah flecks of whited clay , great hero , vaunted lord — ah petal , dust and wind-fall on the ground — queen awaiting queen .</p>
     <p>Better the weight , they tell , the helmet 's beaten shell , Athene 's riven steel , caught over the white skull , Athene sets to heal the few who merit it .</p>
     <p>Yet even then , what help , should he not turn and note the height of forehead and the mark of conquest , draw near and try the helmet ; to left — reset the crown Athene weighted down , or break with a light touch mayhap the steel set to protect ; to slay or heal .</p>
     <p>A treacherous god , they say , yet who would wait to test justice or worth or right , when through a fetid night is wafted faint and nearer — then straight as point of steel to one who courts swift death , scent of Hesperidean orange-spray .</p>

      <head>PRAYER</head>
      <head>White , O white face — from disenchanted days wither alike dark rose and fiery bays : no gift within our hands , nor strength to praise , only defeat and silence ; though we lift hands , disenchanted , of small strength , nor raise branch of the laurel or the light of torch , but fold the garment on the riven locks , yet hear , all-merciful , and touch the fore-head , dim , unlit of pride and thought , Mistress — be near ! Give back the glamour to our will , the thought ; give back the tool , the chisel ; once we wrought things not unworthy , sandal and steel-clasp ; silver and steel , the coat with white leaf-pattern at the arm and throat : silver and metal , hammered for the ridge of shield and helmet-rim ; white silver with the dark hammered in , belt , staff and magic spear-shaft with the gilt spark at the point and hilt .</head>
