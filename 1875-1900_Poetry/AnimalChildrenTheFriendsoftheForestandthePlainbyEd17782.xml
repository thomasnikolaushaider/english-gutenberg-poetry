    <head>FOREWORD</head>
    <p n="1">When God made the world He planted the flowers and the grass and the trees to make things beautiful to look upon ; He swung the sun and the moon and the stars in the sky to make things bright ; He put the birds in the trees to fill the air with music , and when He made the animals we believe that he intended them to be the friends of man .</p>
    <p n="2">Why , is n't the dog the best playmate that a boy can have ? Did any one ever hear of Towser or Gyp being false friends ? And the soft , dainty , cunning bit of a fluffy ball of a kitten who comes rubbing its downy sides against the tiny girl 's skirts begging for a return caress , is there a play-fellow more lovable ? And the squirrel who comes begging at the window for nuts ; the bunny rabbit who snuggles its delicate nose , trustingly , under the little boy 's chin ; the horse who has been man 's friend in times of trouble and of peace , bearing his burdens or scampering with him over the fields and roads in play ; the cow who has sent her good milk to the babies of all time ; the sheep and the goats who have given of their wool to keep us warm ,— we love them all dearly .</p>
    <p n="3">In this volume we have tried to make friends and playmates of all of the animals . You have loved the “ Flower Children ” and the “ Bird Children ” whom the publisher already has made your playmates . We feel that you are going to be just as happy to know the “ Animal Children . ” Therefore we add to “ The Little Cousins of the Field and Garden ” and “ The Little Playmates of the Flower Children , ” this volume — “ The Friends of the Forest and the Plain . ”</p>

     <l n="17">Just winks and cries gaily : “ Catch me , if you can . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="18">This dapper young chappy is Dude Ocelot ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="22">The chetah is a great big cat</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="26">The little Bobcat and Canadian Lynx</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="30">A dainty , fastidious man is Lord Otter</l>
     <l n="31">Who can live just as well on land as in water ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="34">“ It really is a bother to be sought by everyone ”</l>
     <l n="35">The vain young Ermine boasted . “ Why , it keeps me on the run</l>
     <l n="36">To get away from kings and queens and peers and ladies great —</l>
     <l n="37">It truly gets me all fussed up and in a dreadful state . ”</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="50">Mr. and Mrs. Mongoose are popular as can be ,</l>
     <l n="51">The reason being very plain , as you will all agree ,</l>

     <l n="62">Lemur stays in bed all day</l>
     <l n="63">And waits until the night to play ;</l>
     <l n="64">That 's why his soft feet make no sound</l>
     <l n="65">And why his eyes are big and round .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="66">The bowery boy of the woods is young Mink ,</l>
     <l n="67">His coat is so lovely one never would think</l>
