      <head>ACCIDENTS WILL HAPPEN</head>
       <l n="1">He was a burly Dutch tenor ,</l>
       <l n="2">And I patiently trailed him in his waking and sleeping hours</l>
       <l n="3">That I might not lose a story ,—</l>
       <l n="4">But his life was commonplace and unimaginative —</l>
       <l n="5">Air raids and abdications kept his activities ,</l>
       <l n="6">( A game of bridge yesterday , a ride to Tarrytown ) ,</l>
       <l n="7">Out of the papers .</l>
       <l n="8">I watchfully waited ,</l>
       <l n="9">Yearning a coup that would place him on the</l>
       <l n="10">Musical map .</l>
       <l n="11">A coup , such as kissing a Marshal Joffre ,</l>
       <l n="12">Aeroplaning over the bay ,</l>
       <l n="13">Diving with Annette Kellerman .</l>
       <l n="14">Then for three days I quit the city</l>
       <l n="15">To get a simple contralto into the western papers .</l>
       <l n="16">Returning I entered my office ; the phone jangled .</l>
       <l n="17">The burly tenor was tearfully sobbing and moaning over the wire ;</l>
       <l n="18">Tremor and emotion choked his throat .</l>
       <l n="19">This was his ominous message :</l>
       <l n="20">A taxicab accident almost had killed him two and one half days ago ;</l>
       <l n="21">He had escaped with his body and orchid-lined voice —</l>
       <l n="22">And not a line in the mornings or evenings !</l>
       <l n="23">What could I do about it ?</l>
       <l n="24">Accidents will happen .</l>

      <head>THE BARITONE</head>
       <l n="1">He was a wonderful Metropolitan singer .</l>
       <l n="2">His name had been blazoned over these United States ,</l>
       <l n="3">And in Europe it was as well known .</l>
       <l n="4">Records of him could be bought in the smallest hamlet ;</l>
       <l n="5">Nothing but praise had been shed upon the glory of his name .</l>
       <l n="6">In May he was scheduled to sing in Chicago</l>
       <l n="7">At a festival where thousands were to foregather</l>
       <l n="8">To do praise to him and his voice .</l>
       <l n="9">Two days before he left , he came to his manager 's office</l>
       <l n="10">With a sickly expression all over his rotund face</l>
       <l n="11">And a deathly gasp in his voice .</l>
       <l n="12">One thought he needed a doctor ,</l>
       <l n="13">Or the first aid of some Red Cross nurses .</l>
       <l n="14">He was ushered into the private office</l>
       <l n="15">To find out his trouble .</l>
       <l n="16">This was his lament in short ;</l>
       <l n="17">A friend , in the hurry of the moment ,</l>
       <l n="18">Had procured tickets for him on the Twentieth Century</l>
       <l n="19">Which demanded an extra fare of six dollars ,—</l>
       <l n="20">And he wanted to ride on the cheapest train .</l>
       <l n="21">So we got him tickets on another road</l>
       <l n="22">Which takes thirty six hours to Chicago and perhaps more ,</l>
       <l n="23">And the great singer , whose name has been blazoned over these United States</l>
       <l n="24">And was as well known in Europe ,</l>
       <l n="25">Walked out contented and smiling like a young boy .</l>

      <head>PATRIOTISM</head>
       <l n="1">The patriotic orchestra of eighty five men</l>
       <l n="2">Was keyed to an extraordinary patriotic pitch</l>
       <l n="3">For these were patriotic concerts ,</l>
       <l n="4">Supported by the leading patriots of the town ,</l>
       <l n="5">( Including a Bulgarian merchant , an Austrian physician and a German lawyer ) ,</l>
       <l n="6">And all the musicians were getting union wages — and in the summer at that .</l>
       <l n="7">So they were patriotic too .</l>
       <l n="8">The Welsh conductor was also patriotic ,</l>
       <l n="9">For his name on the program was larger than that of the date or the hall ,</l>
       <l n="10">But when the manager asked him to play a number</l>
       <l n="11">Designated as “ Dixie , ”</l>
       <l n="12">He disposed of it shortly with the words :</l>
       <l n="13">“ It is too trivial — that music . ”</l>
       <l n="14">And , instead , he played a lullaby by an unknown Welsh composer ,—</l>
       <l n="15">( Because he was a Welshman ) ....</l>
       <l n="16">The audience left after the concert was over</l>
       <l n="17">And complimented itself individually and collectively on “ doing its bit ”</l>
       <l n="18">By attending and listening to these patriotic concerts .</l>

      <head>THE PILLOW CASES</head>
       <l n="1">The train was due to arrive at eleven that night ,</l>
       <l n="2">But owing to the usual delay it did not arrive until one .</l>
       <l n="3">The reporters of the leading dailies</l>
       <l n="4">Were still waiting grouchily on the station platform for the great star .</l>
       <l n="5">For weeks his name had blotted out every bare wall ,</l>
       <l n="6">And the date sheets of his coming had reddened the horizon .</l>
       <l n="7">Now he steps off the train , tired and disgruntled .</l>
       <l n="8">What cares he for the praise of the public and their prophets</l>
       <l n="9">Awaiting him impatiently at the station ?</l>
       <l n="10">It 's a bed he wants — any bed will do ;</l>
       <l n="11">The quicker he gets it , the better for the song on the morrow .</l>
       <l n="12">But in cooking the news for the public</l>
       <l n="13">One a. m. is the same thing as noon day .</l>
       <l n="14">So they rushed the star with these questions :</l>
       <l n="15">“ Not conscripted yet ?... ”</l>
       <l n="16">“ How do you like this town ?... ”</l>
       <l n="17">“ Will you give any encores tomorrow ?... ”</l>
       <l n="18">“ When will the war end ?... ”</l>
       <l n="19">Ruthlessly he plowed through them ,</l>
       <l n="20">Like a British tank at Messines .</l>
       <l n="21">The tenor wanted a bed ,</l>
       <l n="22">But Lesville wanted a story ....</l>
       <l n="23">On the platform patiently nestled were twenty six pieces of luggage ,</l>
       <l n="24">Twenty six pieces of luggage , containing more than their content ,</l>
       <l n="25">Twenty six pieces of luggage would get him the story , he had not given himself .</l>
       <l n="26">Craftily , one lured the reporters to look on this bulging baggage ,</l>
       <l n="27">“ Pillows and pillows and pillow .... ” was whispered ,</l>
       <l n="28">“ Tonight he will sleep on them . ”</l>
       <l n="29">Vulture-like swooped down the porters ,</l>
       <l n="30">Bearing them off to the taxis .</l>
       <l n="31">Next morning the papers carried the story :</l>
       <l n="32">“ Singer Transports His Own Bedding , ”</l>
       <l n="33">But the artist slept soundly on Ostermoors that night .</l>
       <l n="34">The baggage held scores for the orchestra .</l>

      <head>BETTER INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS</head>
       <l n="1">He was the head of a large real estate firm ,</l>
       <l n="2">And his avocation was seeking the good in a Better Industrial Relations Society .</l>
       <l n="3">They were going to have an exhibit in their church building ,</l>
       <l n="4">At which it was to be proved</l>
       <l n="5">That giving a gold watch for an invention</l>
       <l n="6">That made millions for the factory owner</l>
       <l n="7">Was worthwhile .</l>
       <l n="8">But they needed a press agent</l>
       <l n="9">To let the world and themselves</l>
       <l n="10">Know that what they were doing was good .</l>
       <l n="11">I was chosen for the work ,</l>
       <l n="12">But the head of the large real estate firm</l>
       <l n="13">Thought that half a column a day was too little</l>
       <l n="14">To record the fact that a cash register company</l>
       <l n="15">In which he owned stock</l>
       <l n="16">Had presented a medal to an employee who had remained with them</l>
       <l n="17">At the same salary for fifteen years .</l>
       <l n="18">So he had me fired .</l>
       <l n="19">And the Better Industrial Relations Exhibit was a great success .</l>
       <l n="20">And many of the morning and evening newspapers</l>
       <l n="21">Ran editorials about it .</l>

      <head>THE PRIMA DONNA</head>
       <l n="1">She had been interviewed at all possible times ,—</l>
       <l n="2">And sometimes the interviews came at impossible ones ;</l>
       <l n="3">But it did not matter to her</l>
       <l n="4">As long as the stories were printed and her name was spelt correctly .</l>
       <l n="5">So we sent a photographer to the hotel one day</l>
       <l n="6">To take pictures of her in her drawing room .</l>
       <l n="7">He was an ungentle photographer</l>
       <l n="8">Who had been accustomed to take pictures of young women</l>
       <l n="9">Coming into the harbor on shipboard , and no photograph was complete</l>
       <l n="10">Without limbs being crossed or suchwise .</l>
       <l n="11">But she did not mind even that ,</l>
       <l n="12">If the pictures were published the next day .</l>
       <l n="13">He took a great number of her in her salon ,</l>
       <l n="14">And departed happy at the day 's bagging .</l>
       <l n="15">A great international disturbance reduced all the white space available</l>
       <l n="16">And no photographs were printed the next day</l>
       <l n="17">Of the prima donna .</l>
       <l n="18">And when I met her at rehearsal , she said very shortly :</l>
       <l n="19">“ Je vous ne parle plus ” and looked at me harshly .</l>
       <l n="20">Was I to blame for the international situation ?</l>

       <l n="3">I painstakingly pick out words on the typewriter ,</l>

      <head>THE DISTRIBUTION OF CREDIT</head>
       <l n="1">The Irish prize play had come back to Broadway .</l>
       <l n="2">Where to put the credit ? On the astute manager</l>
       <l n="3">Who saw in it</l>
       <l n="4">A year of Broadway , two of stock , eternity in the movies ;</l>
       <l n="5">Or the League of Public Spirited Women</l>
       <l n="6">Banded together to uplift the Drama —</l>
       <l n="7">That was the question stirring dramatic circles and the public .</l>
       <l n="8">It had failed in its first run of three weeks at an uptown theatre</l>
       <l n="9">Miserably ,</l>
       <l n="10">Despite glowing reviews in all the dailies .</l>
       <l n="11">But this come-back</l>
       <l n="12">At a Broadway theatre , with electric lights , and transient crowds</l>
       <l n="13">That would save it —</l>
       <l n="14">Was the universal verdict .</l>
       <l n="15">During the first week there was a tremendous fight</l>
       <l n="16">Between the two factions for the</l>
       <l n="17">Distribution of credit , and some critics said</l>
       <l n="18">The League of Public Spirited Women was responsible</l>
       <l n="19">For bringing the play back , because they had bulletined it ,</l>
       <l n="20">And others said it was the astute manager .</l>
       <l n="21">But no audience came to the play after the second week .</l>
       <l n="22">And it went to the storehouse .</l>

       <l n="14">What was she to do about it ?</l>
       <l n="15">She received no response from the American public .</l>
       <l n="16">The poor assistant stagehands of the Paris theatres</l>
       <l n="17">They were out of work — destitute —</l>
       <l n="18">The theatres closed — and all the actors at the front .</l>
       <l n="19">But what could be done for them , the poor Paris stagehands ?</l>
       <l n="20">That was her query .</l>
       <l n="21">And tears welled up in her eyes , as she spoke</l>
       <l n="22">While her husband chased the Angora from under the sofa —</l>
       <l n="23">I sat and discussed the question .</l>
       <l n="24">And tears came to my eyes ,</l>
       <l n="25">But my tears were wept for another reason .</l>

      <head>PHOTOGRAPHS</head>
       <l n="1">I had ordered the photographs of the prima donna .</l>
       <l n="2">They are lovely and beautiful to behold and they are printed before me in magazine .</l>
       <l n="3">Her madonna like face sheds radiance on the prospective box-office patron ;</l>
       <l n="4">He is dazzled by her sun-like head of hair ;</l>
       <l n="5">He loses his heart and his pocket-book when he glances on them .</l>
       <l n="6">I felt happy that I changed photographers .</l>
       <l n="7">I felt that my discovery of a new artisan of the sensitized plate</l>
       <l n="8">Would bring glory and money to many .</l>
       <l n="9">I sit by the rolltop desk and pull out again the objects of my praises .</l>
       <l n="10">The telephone bell rings and awakens me from my reveries ,—</l>
       <l n="11">It is the voice of the beautiful prima donna herself ;</l>
       <l n="12">But the melodious notes the critics have praised are changed .</l>
       <l n="13">There is a raucous , strident tone in the voice ;</l>
       <l n="14">It sounds like the rasping bark of the harpies .</l>
       <l n="15">“ How dare you use those terrible photographs ? ”</l>
       <l n="16">“ What do you mean by insulting my beauty ? ”</l>
       <l n="17">There is a slam down of the telephone receiver ,—</l>
       <l n="18">I turn to my work of writing an advertisement about the prima donna 's voice .</l>

      <head>LO , THE PRESS AGENT</head>
       <l n="1">By many names men call me —</l>
       <l n="2">Press agent , publicity promoter , faker ;</l>
       <l n="3">Ofttimes the short and simple liar .</l>
       <l n="4">Charles A. Dana told me</l>
       <l n="5">I was a buccaneer</l>
       <l n="6">On the high seas of journalism .</l>
       <l n="7">Many a newspaper business manager</l>
       <l n="8">Has charged me</l>
       <l n="9">With selling his space</l>
       <l n="10">Over his head .</l>
       <l n="11">Every one loves me</l>
       <l n="12">When I get his name into print —</l>
       <l n="13">For this is an age of publicity</l>
       <l n="14">And he who bloweth not his own horn</l>
       <l n="15">The same shall not be blown .</l>
       <l n="16">I have sired , nursed and reared</l>
       <l n="17">Many reputations .</l>
       <l n="18">Few men or women have I found</l>
       <l n="19">Scornful of praise or blame</l>
       <l n="20">In the press .</l>
       <l n="21">The folk of the stage</l>
       <l n="22">Live on publicity ,</l>
       <l n="23">Yet to the world they pretend to dislike it ,</l>
       <l n="24">Though wildly to me they plead for it , cry for it ,</l>
       <l n="25">Ofttimes do that for it</l>
       <l n="26">Which must make the God Notoriety</l>
       <l n="27">Grin at the weakness of mortals .</l>
       <l n="28">I hold a terrible power</l>
       <l n="29">And sometimes my own moderation</l>
       <l n="30">Amazes me ,</l>
       <l n="31">For I can abase as well as elevate ,</l>
       <l n="32">Tear down as well as build up .</l>
       <l n="33">I know all the ways of fair speaking</l>
       <l n="34">And can lead my favorites</l>
       <l n="35">To fame and golden rewards .</l>
       <l n="36">There are a thousand channels</l>
       <l n="37">Through which press agency can exploit</l>
       <l n="38">Its star or its movement</l>
       <l n="39">Never obvious but like the submarine</l>
       <l n="40">Submersible beneath the sea</l>
       <l n="41">Of publicity .</l>
       <l n="42">But I know , too , of the ways</l>
       <l n="43">That undo in Manhattan .</l>
       <l n="44">There are bacilli of rumor</l>
       <l n="45">That slip through the finest of filters</l>
       <l n="46">And defy the remedial serums</l>
       <l n="47">Of angry denial .</l>
       <l n="48">Pin a laugh to your tale</l>
       <l n="49">When stalking your enemy</l>
       <l n="50">And not your exile nor your death</l>
       <l n="51">Will stay the guffaws of merriment</l>
       <l n="52">As the story flies</l>
       <l n="53">Through the Wicked Forties</l>
       <l n="54">And on to the “ Road . ”</l>
       <l n="55">Laughter gives the rumor strong wings .</l>
       <l n="56">Truly the press agent ,</l>
       <l n="57">Who knows his psychology ,</l>
       <l n="58">Likewise his New York</l>
       <l n="59">In all of its ramifications ,</l>
       <l n="60">And has a nimble wit ,</l>
       <l n="61">Can play fast and loose</l>
       <l n="62">With the lives of many .</l>
       <l n="63">Nevertheless he has no great reward ,</l>
       <l n="64">And most in the theatre</l>
       <l n="65">Draw fatter returns than he .</l>
       <l n="66">Yet is he called upon to make the show ,</l>
       <l n="67">To save the show ,</l>
       <l n="68">But never is he given credit</l>
       <l n="69">Comparable to that which falls</l>
       <l n="70">Upon the slightest jester or singer or dancer</l>
       <l n="71">Who mugs , mimes , or hoofs in a hit .</l>
       <l n="72">Yet is the press agent happy ;</l>
       <l n="73">He loves his work ;</l>
       <l n="74">It has excitement and intrigue ;</l>
       <l n="75">And to further the cause of beautiful women ,</l>
       <l n="76">To discover the wonderful girls of the theatre ,</l>
       <l n="77">And lead them in progress triumphal</l>
       <l n="78">Till their names outface the jealous night ,</l>
       <l n="79">On Broadway , in incandescents ,</l>
       <l n="80">Is in itself a privilege .</l>
       <l n="81">That compensates</l>
       <l n="82">For the wisdom of the cub reporter ,</l>
       <l n="83">The amusement of the seasoned editor ,</l>
       <l n="84">Shredding the cherished story</l>
       <l n="85">And uprooting the flourishing “ plant ” ;</l>
       <l n="86">Makes one forgive</l>
       <l n="87">The ingratitude of artists arrived .</l>
       <l n="88">They who do not love me</l>
       <l n="89">I hope to have fear me ;</l>
       <l n="90">There is only one hell ,</l>

       <l n="10">“ Oh , what an awful oil can that piece turned out to be ! ”</l>
       <l n="11">It 's hard when the Chanters of Death-House Blues</l>
       <l n="12">Have to turn to each other and reluctantly murmur :</l>
       <l n="13">“ I 'm afraid it 's a hit — the poor fish is lucky . ”</l>
       <l n="14">First-nighters are the theatre 's forty-niners ,</l>
       <l n="15">Making the early rush to new dramatic gold fields ,</l>
       <l n="16">And usually finding them barren .</l>
       <l n="17">Often must it madden the playwright to offer his ideals</l>
       <l n="18">To an audience whose personnel would for the most part</l>
       <l n="19">Regard an ideal as a symptom of sickness ;</l>
       <l n="20">To show sweetness and beauty and color</l>
       <l n="21">To those whose knowledge of tints is confined</l>
       <l n="22">To the rouge and the lip stick on dressers ;</l>
       <l n="23">To pioneer in playwrighting , to delve deep into mind ,</l>
       <l n="24">When all that the first-nighters ask is plain entertainment .</l>
       <l n="25">How much of the great , wholesome public , hard-working and normal ,</l>
       <l n="26">To whom the final appeal must be made</l>
       <l n="27">Frequents our first nights on Broadway ?</l>
       <l n="28">Costumers , friends of the author , and critics ,</l>
       <l n="29">Scene painters , all of the tradesmen concerned ,</l>
       <l n="30">Kinsfolk of mummers even to the third generation ,</l>
       <l n="31">Wine agents , hot-house ladies , unemployed players ,</l>
       <l n="32">Hearty laughers or ready weepers “ planted . ”</l>
       <l n="33">Most of them there prepare for a funeral ;</l>
       <l n="34">Their diversion is nodding to friends and acquaintances ,</l>
       <l n="35">And he or she who nods the most times</l>
       <l n="36">Is thereby the greatest first-nighter .</l>
       <l n="37">Some managers open to hand-picked audiences ,</l>
       <l n="38">Others strive to escape the regulars ;</l>
       <l n="39">But the majority seek for the standardized premier faces</l>
       <l n="40">That really mean so little in the life of the play .</l>
       <l n="41">Listen to the comments during intermission :</l>
       <l n="42">“ It does n't get over ! ” “ It 's a flop ! ”</l>
       <l n="43">“ What atmosphere ! ” “ An absolute steal ! ”</l>
       <l n="44">“ Such originality ! ” “ Not a bit life-like ! ”</l>
       <l n="45">“ That author has a wonderful memory ! ”</l>
       <l n="46">“ He copped that lyric from Irving Berlin ! ”</l>
       <l n="47">“ He 's as funny as a crutch or a cry for help ! ”</l>
       <l n="48">“ They grabbed that number in London ! ”</l>
       <l n="49">“ She 's one of his tigers ! ”</l>
       <l n="50">“ From a Lucile model , my dear , but home-made ! ”</l>
       <l n="51">“ I can n't hand him anything on this one ! ”</l>
       <l n="52">“ Some heavy-sugar papa backed the production ! ”</l>
       <l n="53">“ Is n't my boy wonderful ! ”</l>
       <l n="54">“ Yes , but my girl is running away with the piece ! ”</l>
       <l n="55">“ If you like this , you 're not well ! ”</l>
       <l n="56">“ What could be sweeter ! ”</l>
       <l n="57">“ What large feet she has ! ” “ His Adam 's apple annoys me ! ”</l>
       <l n="58">“ She must get her clothes on Avenue A ! ”</l>
       <l n="59">“ They say she was born there ! ”</l>
       <l n="60">“ What an awful sunburn ! ”</l>
       <l n="61">“ Best thing in years ! ” “ The storehouse for this one ! ”</l>
       <l n="62">“ Did you catch her going up in her lines ? ”</l>
       <l n="63">“ Yes , and he 's fluffing all over the place ! ”</l>
       <l n="64">“ Splendidly produced , do n't you think ? ”</l>
       <l n="65">“ I think the stage direction is rotten ! ”</l>
       <l n="66">So I suggest the old Roman fashion of presenting ,</l>
       <l n="67">The artists , like gladiators crying :</l>
       <l n="68">“ We , who are about to die , salute you ! ”</l>

      <head>THE DRAMATIST</head>
       <l n="1">I 've put one over at last !</l>
       <l n="2">My play with the surprise finish is a bear .</l>
       <l n="3">Al Woods wants to read all of my scripts ;</l>
       <l n="4">Georgie Cohan speaks to me as an equal</l>
       <l n="5">And the office boy swings the gate without being asked .</l>
       <l n="6">I do n't care if the manager 's name is as large as the play 's</l>
       <l n="7">Or if the critics are featured all over the ash cans .</l>
       <l n="8">I 'm going to get mine and I 'm going to live .</l>
       <l n="9">A Rolls-Royce for me and trips “ up the road , ”</l>
       <l n="10">Long Beach and pretty girls , big eats at the Ritz</l>
       <l n="11">And the ice pitcher for the fellows who snubbed me .</l>
       <l n="12">How the other reporters laughed</l>
       <l n="13">When I showed my first script and started to peddle !</l>
       <l n="14">“ Stick to the steady job , ” they advised .</l>
       <l n="15">“ Play writing is too big a gamble ;</l>
       <l n="16">It will never keep your nose in the feed bag . ”</l>
       <l n="17">I wrote a trunkful of junk ; did a play succeed ,</l>
       <l n="18">I immediately copied the fashion ;</l>
       <l n="19">Like a pilfering tailor I stole the new models .</l>
       <l n="20">Kind David Belasco , with his face in the gloom ,</l>
       <l n="21">And mine brightly lighted , said ministerially :</l>
       <l n="22">“ Rather crude yet , my boy , but the way to write a play</l>
       <l n="23">Is to write plays from sunrise to sunset</l>
       <l n="24">And rewrite them long after midnight .</l>
       <l n="25">Try , try , try , my boy , and God bless you . ”</l>
       <l n="26">Broke and disgusted , I became a play reader</l>
       <l n="27">And the “ yessir man ” to a manager .</l>
       <l n="28">I was a play doctor , too .</l>
       <l n="29">A few of my patients lived</l>
       <l n="30">And I learned about drama from them .</l>
       <l n="31">How we gutted the scripts !</l>
       <l n="32">Grabbing a wonderful line , a peach of a scene ,</l>
       <l n="33">A gem of a finish</l>
       <l n="34">Out of the rubbish that struggling poor devils</l>
       <l n="35">Borrowed money to typewrite and mail to us .</l>
       <l n="36">It 's like opening oysters looking for pearls ,</l>
       <l n="37">But pearls are to be found and out of the shell heaps</l>
       <l n="38">Come jewels that , polished and set by a clever artificer ,</l>
       <l n="39">Are a season 's theatrical wonder .</l>
       <l n="40">Finally came my own big idea .</l>
       <l n="41">I wrote and rewrote and cast and recast ,</l>
       <l n="42">Convinced the manager , got a production .</l>
       <l n="43">Here am I young and successful ,</l>
       <l n="44">And Walter and Thomas and Selwyn have nothing on me .</l>
       <l n="45">Press agents are hired to praise me .</l>
       <l n="46">Watch for my next big sensation ,</l>
       <l n="47">But meanwhile I hope that that play-writing plumber ,</l>
       <l n="48">Who had an idea and nothing else ,</l>
       <l n="49">Never sees this one .</l>

       <l n="22">Loyalty , candor , clear seeing ,</l>
       <l n="23">Sincerity , plain speaking , love of his own ,</l>
       <l n="24">Passion for all things American .</l>
       <l n="25">From Jerry , his father ,</l>

       <l n="79">Best of all about Cohan</l>

      <head>DAVID BELASCO</head>
       <l n="1">King David of old slew the Philistines ;</l>
       <l n="2">Our David has made them admirers and patrons ;</l>
       <l n="3">He has numbered the people</l>
       <l n="4">Night after night in his theatres .</l>
       <l n="5">Will he ever , I wonder , send forth for the Shunammite ?</l>
       <l n="6">Many there be who would answer his calling ,</l>
       <l n="7">For he has shown ambitious fair women</l>
       <l n="8">To acting 's high places .</l>
       <l n="9">As Rodin in marble saw wondrous creations</l>
       <l n="10">To be freed by the chisel ,</l>
       <l n="11">So Belasco in immature genius and beauty</l>
       <l n="12">Sees the resplendent star to be kindled</l>
       <l n="13">At his own steady beacon .</l>
       <l n="14">Too varied a mind for our comprehension ,</l>
       <l n="15">Too big and too broad and too subtle</l>
       <l n="16">To be understood of the bourgeois American</l>
       <l n="17">Whom he has led decade after decade</l>
       <l n="18">By a nose ring artistic .</l>
       <l n="19">Capable of everything , he has worked</l>
       <l n="20">With the ease of a master , giving the public</l>
       <l n="21">Marvelous detail , unfailing sensation and poses pictorial ;</l>
       <l n="22">Preferring the certain success to arduous striving</l>
       <l n="23">For the more excellent things of the future .</l>
       <l n="24">Like David his forebear , a king but no prophet ,</l>
       <l n="25">Amazingly wise in his own generation .</l>
       <l n="26">A wizard in art of the everyday ,</l>
       <l n="27">Lord of the spotlight and dimmer ,</l>
       <l n="28">But nursing the unconquerable hope , the inviolable shade</l>
       <l n="29">Of what in his dreams Oriental</l>
       <l n="30">He fain would do , did not necessity drive him .</l>
       <l n="31">His the fascination of a great personality .</l>
       <l n="32">Who knoweth not him of the clerical collar ?</l>
       <l n="33">Hair of the sage and eyes of the poet ,</l>
       <l n="34">Features perfectly drawn and as mobile</l>
       <l n="35">As those of the inspired actor ;</l>
       <l n="36">With speech so much blander than honey</l>
       <l n="37">And insight that maketh his staged stumbling in bargains</l>
       <l n="38">Cover the shrewdness of a masterly trader .</l>
       <l n="39">None better than he knoweth the crowd and its likings ,</l>
       <l n="40">As to using the patter of drama artistic ,</l>
       <l n="41">That 's where he lives .</l>
       <l n="42">With incense and color and scenery</l>
       <l n="43">He refilleth the bottle of art so that the contents</l>
       <l n="44">Go twice better than in the original package .</l>
       <l n="45">Thanks be to David for joy in the playhouse .</l>
       <l n="46">Wizard , magician , necromancer of switchboards ,</l>
       <l n="47">He hath woven spells from the actual ,</l>
       <l n="48">Keeping ideals and ideas well in the background .</l>
       <l n="49">Like Gautier , these things delight him :</l>
       <l n="50">Gold , marble and purple ; brilliance , solidity , color .</l>
       <l n="51">He can stage Tiffany 's jewels but not Maeterlinck 's bees .</l>
       <l n="52">Deep in his soul there are tempests</l>
       <l n="53">Revealed in the storms of his dramas —</l>
       <l n="54">Sandstorm and snowstorm , rainstorm and hurricane .</l>
       <l n="55">That nature revealed in its subtle reactions</l>
       <l n="56">Would show in its deeps the soul of an Angelo</l>
       <l n="57">Subdued to success and dyed by democracy .</l>
       <l n="58">Opportunism hath made him</l>

      <head>LO , THE HEADLINER</head>
       <l n="1">I was not raised for vaudeville .</l>
       <l n="2">Father and mother were veteran legits ;</l>
       <l n="3">They loved the Bard and the “ Lady of Lyons . ”</l>
       <l n="4">I was born on a show boat on the Cumberland ;</l>
       <l n="5">I was carried on as a child</l>
       <l n="6">When the farm girl revealed her shame</l>
       <l n="7">On the night of the snowstorm .</l>
       <l n="8">The old folks died with grease paint on their faces .</l>
       <l n="9">I did a little of everything</l>
       <l n="10">Even to staking out a pitch in a street fair .</l>
       <l n="11">Hiram Grafter taught me to ballyhoo</l>
       <l n="12">And to make openings .</l>
       <l n="13">I stole the business of Billy Sunday</l>
       <l n="14">And imitated William Jennings Bryan .</l>
       <l n="15">I became famous in the small towns .</l>
       <l n="16">One day Poli heard me —</l>
       <l n="17">He 's the head of the New England variety circuit .—</l>
       <l n="18">“ Cul , ” he said , “ you are a born monologist .</l>
       <l n="19">Where you got that stuff I do n't know ,</l>
       <l n="20">But you would be a riot in the two-a-day .</l>
       <l n="21">Quit this hanky-panky</l>
       <l n="22">And I 'll make you a headliner . ”</l>
       <l n="23">Well , I fell for his line of talk</l>
       <l n="24">Like the sod busters had fallen for mine .</l>
       <l n="25">Aaron Hoffman wrote me a topical monologue ;</l>
       <l n="26">Max Marx made me a suit of clothes ;</l>
       <l n="27">And Lew Dockstader wised me up</l>
       <l n="28">On how to jockey my laughs .</l>
       <l n="29">I opened in Hartford ;</l>
       <l n="30">Believe me , I was some scream .</l>
       <l n="31">I gave them gravy , and hokum ,</l>
       <l n="32">And when they ate it up I came through</l>
       <l n="33">With the old jasbo ,</l>
       <l n="34">Than which there is nothing so efficacious</l>
       <l n="35">In vaudeville , polite or otherwise .</l>
       <l n="36">The first thing I did I hollered for more dough ,</l>
       <l n="37">And Poli says :</l>
       <l n="38">“ That 's what I get for feeding you meat ,</l>
       <l n="39">But you are a riot all right , all right ,</l>
       <l n="40">So I guess you are on for more kale . ”</l>
       <l n="41">I kept getting better .</l>
       <l n="42">I got so 's I could follow any act at all</l>
       <l n="43">And get my laughs .</l>
       <l n="44">And he who getteth his laughs</l>
       <l n="45">Is greater than he who taketh a city .</l>
       <l n="46">At last the Palace Theatre sent for me</l>
       <l n="47">And I signed up for a week .</l>
       <l n="48">They kept me two .</l>
       <l n="49">I am a headliner ;</l>
       <l n="50">I stand at the corner of Forty-seventh Street</l>
       <l n="51">And Little Old Broadway ;</l>
       <l n="52">Throw out my chest ,</l>
       <l n="53">Call the agents and vaudeville magnates</l>
       <l n="54">By their first names .</l>
       <l n="55">I am a HEADLINER with a home in Freeport .</l>

       <l n="6">That I might live again .</l>
       <l n="7">Yet they hold no reverence for my charms ,</l>

       <l n="9">They do not glance at me ;</l>
       <l n="10">All their admiration , all their awe ,</l>

       <l n="16">Striving to soothe the patron 's ire</l>
       <l n="17">For those few moments when my face is dark .</l>
       <l n="18">Yes , men have built a palace sheltering me ,</l>
       <l n="19">And as the endless ocean washes on its stretch of beach</l>

       <l n="43">The shadow men across my face</l>

       <l n="50">Intrepid men face death</l>
       <l n="51">To catch for me the fleeting phases of the world</l>
       <l n="52">Lest I lose some charming facet of my face .</l>
       <l n="53">And all the masters of all time</l>
       <l n="54">Have thrummed their harps</l>
       <l n="55">And bowed their violins</l>
       <l n="56">To fashion melodies that might be played</l>
       <l n="57">The while I tell my tales .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">I was working on The Daily News</l>
       <l n="2">When I first heard of her ,</l>
       <l n="3">And from that time</l>
       <l n="4">Until the day she came to town</l>
       <l n="5">I longed to see her dance .</l>
       <l n="6">The night the dancer and her ballet came</l>
       <l n="7">The Desk assigned me to my nightly run</l>
       <l n="8">Of hotels , clubs , and undertakers ’ shops ;</l>
       <l n="9">I was so green</l>
       <l n="10">I had not learned</l>
       <l n="11">The art of using telephones</l>
       <l n="12">To make it seem</l>
       <l n="13">That I was hot upon the trail of news</l>
       <l n="14">While loafing otherwhere .</l>
       <l n="15">How could I do my trick</l>
       <l n="16">And also see her dance ?</l>
       <l n="17">So I left bread and butter flat ,</l>
       <l n="18">To feast my eyes , which had been prairie-fed ,</l>
       <l n="19">Upon this vision from another world .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="20">I 'd seen the wind</l>

       <l n="23">And felt the pulse of growing things</l>
       <l n="24">Upon the April air ;</l>
       <l n="25">I 'd seen the hawks arise and soar ;</l>
       <l n="26">And dragon-flies</l>
       <l n="27">At sunrise over misty pools —</l>
       <l n="28">But all these things had never known a name</l>
       <l n="29">Until I saw Pavlowa dance .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="30">Next day the editor explained</l>
       <l n="31">That although art was — art ,</l>
       <l n="32">He 'd found a boy to take my place .</l>
       <l n="33">The days that followed</l>
       <l n="34">When I walked the town</l>

       <l n="37">Blended with the dream</l>

       <l n="40">My thoughts would go no further</l>
       <l n="41">Than Pavlowa as the maid Giselle ...</l>
       <l n="42">Then cold days came ,</l>
       <l n="43">And found the dream a fabric much too thin ;</l>
       <l n="44">And finally a job ,</l>

       <l n="46">But through the years</l>

       <l n="49">Unlike all the things</l>
       <l n="50">That Kings and Queens have laid before her feet ;</l>
       <l n="51">And wishing somehow she might know</l>
       <l n="52">About the price</l>

       <l n="55">And then by trick of time ,</l>

       <l n="58">One morning in the darkened wings</l>
       <l n="59">I saw a big-eyed woman in a filmy thing</l>
       <l n="60">Go through the exercises</l>
       <l n="61">Athletes use when training for a team ;</l>
       <l n="62">And from a stage-hand learned</l>
       <l n="63">That this Pavlowa , incomparable one ,</l>
       <l n="64">Out of every day spent hours</l>
       <l n="65">On elementary practice steps .</l>
       <l n="66">And now somehow</l>
       <l n="67">I can not find the heart</l>

       <l n="4">About the age young men go out to colleges</l>

       <l n="9">And stripping off my white man 's clothes</l>
       <l n="10">Painted me with dye made from the chestnut hulls ,</l>
       <l n="11">Laughing the while about the potency of juice</l>

       <l n="22">Surrounded by as many lesser chiefs .</l>
       <l n="23">The hookah solemnly was passed around</l>
       <l n="24">And then the hamlet chief would speak ;</l>
       <l n="25">“ Stranger , why have you forsaken home</l>
       <l n="26">And drawn believers after you ,</l>
       <l n="27">You bear no spices , oil , or woven cloth ,</l>
       <l n="28">No jewels nor any merchantry ? ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="29">And then Abdullah :</l>
       <l n="30">“ True , Allah 's precious son ,</l>
       <l n="31">We trade in naught men feed their bellies on</l>
       <l n="32">But we have wares to thrill brave men ,</l>
       <l n="33">To make your youth see what use bodies are ,</l>
       <l n="34">To make your women blush</l>
       <l n="35">That they have no such men . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="36">“ What are these magic wares ? ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="37">“ Why we have here an Arab youth</l>
       <l n="38">Who seems possessed of wings ,</l>
       <l n="39">Jumping three camels in a row . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="40">“ So ! In this very village there 's a lad</l>
       <l n="41">Who jumps four camels</l>
       <l n="42">With half the wind it takes you , telling of your boy . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="43">Scoff followed boast and back again</l>
       <l n="44">Until the chief arose ,</l>
       <l n="45">Saying to the lesser chiefs</l>
       <l n="46">That they should call the local tribe</l>
       <l n="47">To meet beside the caravanserai</l>
       <l n="48">Before another sun went down</l>
       <l n="49">To see if these vain wandering men</l>
       <l n="50">Could do one half the deeds they boasted .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="51">So we met at sundown ,</l>
       <l n="52">Our brown men stripped</l>
       <l n="53">Except for linen clouts .</l>
       <l n="54">We tumbled , jumped , made human pyramids ,</l>
       <l n="55">And whirled as only Dervish whirl .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="56">Then as a climax the village boy essayed</l>
       <l n="57">To span the four trained camels</l>
       <l n="58">Who at Abdullah 's soft-spoke word</l>
       <l n="59">Moved just enough apart to make the boy fall short .</l>
       <l n="60">And then our sinewed lad would make the leap ,</l>
       <l n="61">The camels crowding close together</l>
       <l n="62">At another soft command .</l>
       <l n="63">Our lad making good his jump ,</l>
       <l n="64">The populace would grant our greater skill ;</l>
       <l n="65">A goatskin filled with wine ,</l>
       <l n="66">And honey mixed with melted butter</l>
       <l n="67">Was offered us within the caravanserai .</l>
       <l n="68">Then we moved out beyond the town</l>
       <l n="69">And pitched our tents of camels ’ hair ,</l>
       <l n="70">Rising before the sun to face the friendless desert wastes</l>
       <l n="71">Until we reached another habitation on the camel trail ,</l>
       <l n="72">I ( who played the dumb boy of the tribe</l>
       <l n="73">Lest my Christian tongue betray me )</l>
       <l n="74">Trudging behind with all the salary —</l>
       <l n="75">Chasing the desert after two new sheep ,</l>
       <l n="76">Our net receipts for that Moroccan one-night stand .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="9">
       <l n="77">Now twice each day within the Hippodrome</l>
       <l n="78">I , a buffoon in absurd clothes ,</l>
       <l n="79">Strive to make the thousands laugh ;</l>
       <l n="80">And when my act is done</l>
       <l n="81">There comes the tread of camels ’ feet ,</l>
       <l n="82">Followed by Slayman Ali and his Arab troupe ,</l>
       <l n="83">Who tumble , jump and build pyramids</l>
       <l n="84">Before a canvas Sphinx upon a painted desert ....</l>
       <l n="85">When I saw Slayman last</l>
       <l n="86">He was a boy</l>
       <l n="87">Chasing the sheep with me</l>
       <l n="88">Beneath Morocco 's moon .</l>
       <l n="89">Tell me , where dwells romance , anyway ?</l>
       <l n="90">In Manhattan , or Arabian , nights ?</l>

       <l n="1">I once knew a man</l>
       <l n="2">Who 'd met Duse ,</l>
       <l n="3">( Or so he said )</l>
       <l n="4">And talked with her ;</l>
       <l n="5">As she came down a windy street</l>
       <l n="6">He turned a corner</l>
       <l n="7">Headlong into her .</l>
       <l n="8">“ I am so sorry , ” Duse said ,</l>
       <l n="9">“ I was looking at the stars . ”</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="10">My envy of that man</l>
       <l n="11">Withstood the years</l>
       <l n="12">Until one day I met a Dane</l>
       <l n="13">Who 'd talked with Henrik Ibsen :</l>
       <l n="14">This man , with head bowed to the wind ,</l>
       <l n="15">Was walking up a Stockholm way</l>
       <l n="16">When ‘ round the corner came the seer ,</l>
       <l n="17">And he plumped into him .</l>
       <l n="18">And that great mind</l>
       <l n="19">Whose thinking moved the world</l>
       <l n="20">Surveyed my friend</l>
       <l n="21">Through his big eyes</l>
       <l n="22">And slowly spoke :</l>
       <l n="23">“ Since when have codfish come to land ? ”</l>

       <l n="24">With all the awe</l>
       <l n="25">One has for those who 've known the great ,</l>
       <l n="26">These two I 've envied</l>
       <l n="27">Until the other day</l>
       <l n="28">When blundering ‘ round behind the scenes</l>
       <l n="29">I stepped upon Pavlowa 's toe .</l>
