   <p>WHEN YOU KNOW A FELLOW</p>
   <p>When you get to know a fellow , know his joys and know his cares , When you 've come to understand him and the burdens that he bears , When you 've learned the fight he 's making and the troubles in his way , Then you find that he is different than you thought him yesterday . You find his faults are trivial and there 's not so much to blame In the brother that you jeered at when you only knew his name .</p>
   <p>You are quick to see the blemish in the distant neighbor 's style , You can point to all his errors and may sneer at him the while , And your prejudices fatten and your hates more violent grow As you talk about the failures of the man you do not know , But when drawn a little closer , and your hands and shoulders touch , You find the traits you hated really do n't amount to much .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">When you get to know a fellow , know his every</l>
     <l n="2">mood and whim ,</l>
     <l n="3">You begin to find the texture of the splendid</l>
     <l n="4">side of him ;</l>
     <l n="5">You begin to understand him , and you cease to</l>
     <l n="6">scoff and sneer ,</l>
     <l n="7">For with understanding always prejudices disappear .</l>
     <l n="8">You begin to find his virtues and his faults you</l>
     <l n="9">cease to tell ,</l>
     <l n="10">For you seldom hate a fellow when you know</l>
     <l n="11">him very well .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>When next you start in sneering and your phrases turn to blame , Know more of him you censure than his business and his name ; For it 's likely that acquaintance would your prejudice dispel And you 'd really come to like him if you knew him very well . When you get to know a fellow and you understand his ways , Then his faults wo n't really matter , for you 'll find a lot to praise .</p>

    <head>THE ROUGH LITTLE RASCAL</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">A smudge on his nose and a smear on his cheek</l>
     <l n="2">And knees that might not have been washed in a week ;</l>
     <l n="3">A bump on his forehead , a scar on his lip ,</l>

     <l n="7">A brow that is beady with jewels of sweat ;</l>

     <l n="10">Now one that his mother declares is a fright :</l>
     <l n="11">A fun-loving , sun-loving rascal , and fine ,</l>

     <l n="13">A crop of brown hair that is tousled and tossed ;</l>

     <l n="16">And eyes that are flashing delight all the time :</l>

   <p>IT ISN'T COSTLY</p>
   <p>Does the grouch get richer quicker than the friendly sort of man ? Can the grumbler labor better than the cheerful fellow can ? Is the mean and churlish neighbor any cleverer than the one Who shouts a glad “ good morning , ” and then smiling passes on ?</p>
   <p>Just stop and think about it . Have you ever known or seen A mean man who succeeded , just because he was so mean ? When you find a grouch with honors and with money in his pouch , You can bet he did n't win them just because he was a grouch .</p>
   <p>Oh , you 'll not be any poorer if you smile along your way , And your lot will not be harder for the kindly things you say . Do n't imagine you are wasting time for others that you spend : You can rise to wealth and glory and still pause to be a friend .</p>

   <p>A WISH</p>
   <p>I 'd like to be a boy again , a care-free prince of joy again , I 'd like to tread the hills and dales the way I used to do ; I 'd like the tattered shirt again , the knickers thick with dirt again , The ugly , dusty feet again that long ago I knew . I 'd like to play first base again , and Sliver 's curves to face again , I 'd like to climb , the way I did , a friendly apple tree ; For , knowing what I do to-day , could I but wander back and play , I 'd get full measure of the joy that boyhood gave to me .</p>
   <p>I 'd like to be a lad again , a youngster , wild and glad again , I 'd like to sleep and eat again the way I used to do ; I 'd like to race and run again , and drain from life its fun again , And start another round of joy the moment one was through . But care and strife have come to me , and often days are glum to me ,</p>
   <p>{ 17 }</p>
   <p>And sleep is not the thing it was and food is not the same ; And I have sighed , and known that I must journey on again to sigh , And I have stood at envy 's point and heard the voice of shame .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">I 've learned that joys are fleeting things ; that</l>
     <l n="2">parting pain each meeting brings ;</l>
     <l n="3">That gain and loss are partners here , and so</l>
     <l n="4">are smiles and tears ;</l>
     <l n="5">That only boys from day to day can drain and</l>
     <l n="6">fill the cup of play ;</l>
     <l n="7">That age must mourn for what is lost</l>
     <l n="8">throughout the coming years .</l>
     <l n="9">But boys cannot appreciate their priceless joy</l>
     <l n="10">until too late</l>
     <l n="11">And those who own the charms I had will</l>
     <l n="12">soon be changed to men ;</l>
     <l n="13">And then , they too will sit , as I , and backward</l>
     <l n="14">turn to look and sigh</l>
     <l n="15">And share my longing , vain , to be a care-free boy again .</l>

    <head>MA AND THE AUTO</head>
     <l n="1">Before we take an auto ride Pa says to Ma :</l>
     <l n="2">“ My dear ,</l>
     <l n="3">Now just remember I do n't need suggestions</l>
     <l n="4">from the rear .</l>
     <l n="5">If you will just sit still back there and hold</l>
     <l n="6">in check your fright ,</l>
     <l n="7">I 'll take you where you want to go and get</l>
     <l n="8">you back all right .</l>
     <l n="9">Remember that my hearing 's good and also I 'm</l>
     <l n="10">not blind ,</l>
     <l n="11">And I can drive this car without suggestions</l>
     <l n="12">from behind . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Ma promises that she 'll keep still , then off we gayly start , But soon she notices ahead a peddler and his cart . “ You 'd better toot your horn , ” says she , “ to let him know we 're near ; He might turn out ! ” and Pa replies : “ Just shriek at him , my dear . ” And then he adds : “ Some day , some guy will make a lot of dough By putting horns on tonneau seats for women-folks to blow ! ”</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">A little farther on Ma cries : “ He signaled for</l>
     <l n="2">a turn ! ”</l>
     <l n="3">And Pa says : “ Did he ? ” in a tone that 's hot</l>
     <l n="4">enough to burn .</l>
     <l n="5">“ Oh , there 's a boy on roller skates ! ” cries Ma .</l>
     <l n="6">“ Now do go slow .</l>
     <l n="7">I 'm sure he does n't see our car . ” And Pa says :</l>
     <l n="8">“ I dunno ,</l>
     <l n="9">I think I do n't need glasses yet , but really it</l>
     <l n="10">may be</l>
     <l n="11">That I am blind and cannot see what 's right</l>
     <l n="12">in front of me . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>If Pa should speed the car a bit some rigs to hurry past Ma whispers : “ Do be careful now . You 're driving much too fast . ” And all the time she 's pointing out the dangers of the street And keeps him posted on the roads where trolley cars he 'll meet . Last night when we got safely home , Pa sighed and said : “ My dear , I 'm sure we 've all enjoyed the drive you gave us from the rear ! ”</p>

    <head>ON GOING HOME FOR CHRISTMAS</head>
    <head>He little knew the sorrow that was in his vacant chair ; He never guessed they 'd miss him , or he 'd surely have been there ; He could n't see his mother or the lump that filled her throat , Or the tears that started falling as she read his hasty note ; And he could n't see his father , sitting sorrowful and dumb , Or he never would have written that he thought he could n't come .</head>

     <l n="9">He did n't guess the meaning of his visit</l>

     <l n="16">stop to think</l>
     <l n="17">How the years are passing swiftly , and next</l>
     <l n="18">Christmas it might be</l>
     <l n="19">There would be no home to visit and no mother</l>
     <l n="20">dear to see .</l>
     <l n="21">He did n't think about it — I 'll not say he did n't</l>
     <l n="22">care .</l>
     <l n="23">He was heedless and forgetful or he 'd surely</l>
     <l n="24">have been there .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Are you going home for Christmas ? Have you written you 'll be there ? Going home to kiss the mother and to show her that you care ? Going home to greet the father in a way to make him glad ? If you 're not I hope there 'll never come a time you 'll wish you had . Just sit down and write a letter — it will make their heart strings hum With a tune of perfect gladness — if you 'll tell them that you 'll come .</p>

   <p>HOME</p>
   <p>It takes a heap o ’ livin ’ in a house t ’ make it home , A heap o ’ sun an ’ shadder , an ’ ye sometimes have t ’ roam Afore ye really ‘ preciate the things ye lef ’ behind , An ’ hunger fer ‘ em somehow , with ‘ em allus on yer mind . It do n't make any differunce how rich ye get t ’ be , How much yer chairs an ’ tables cost , how great yer luxury ; It ai n't home t ’ ye , though it be the palace of a king , Until somehow yer soul is sort o ’ wrapped round everything .</p>
   <p>Home ai n't a place that gold can buy or get up in a minute ; Afore it 's home there 's got t ’ be a heap o ’ livin ’ in it ; Within the walls there 's got t ’ be some babies born , and then Right there ye 've got t ’ bring ‘ em up t ’ women good , an ’ men ; And gradjerly as time goes on , ye find ye would n't part With anything they ever used — they 've grown into yer heart : The old high chairs , the playthings , too , the little shoes they wore Ye hoard ; an ’ if ye could ye 'd keep the thumb-marks on the door .</p>
   <p>Ye 've got t ’ weep t ’ make it home , ye 've got t ’ sit an ’ sigh An ’ watch beside a loved one 's bed , an ’ know that Death is nigh ; An ’ in the stillness o ’ the night t ’ see Death 's angel come , An ’ close the eyes o ’ her that smiled , an ’ leave her sweet voice dumb . Fer these are scenes that grip the heart , an ’ when yer tears are dried , Ye find the home is dearer than it was , an ’ sanctified ; An ’ tuggin ’ at ye always are the pleasant memories O ’ her that was an ’ is no more — ye can n't escape from these .</p>
   <p>Ye 've got t ’ sing an ’ dance fer years , ye 've got t ’ romp an ’ play , An ’ learn t ’ love the things ye have by usin ’ ‘ em each day ; Even the roses ‘ round the porch must blossom year by year Afore they ‘ come a part o ’ ye , suggestin ’ someone dear Who used t ’ love ‘ em long ago , an ’ trained ‘ em jes t ’ run The way they do , so 's they would get the early mornin ’ sun ; Ye 've got t ’ love each brick an ’ stone from cellar up t ’ dome : It takes a heap o ’ livin ’ in a house t ’ make it home .</p>

   <p>A FRIEND 'S GREETING</p>
   <p>I 'd like to be the sort of friend that you have been to me ; I 'd like to be the help that you 've been always glad to be ; I 'd like to mean as much to you each minute of the day As you have meant , old friend of mine , to me along the way .</p>
   <p>I 'd like to do the big things and the splendid things for you , To brush the gray from out your skies and leave them only blue ; I 'd like to say the kindly things that I so oft have heard , And feel that I could rouse your soul the way that mine you 've stirred .</p>
   <p>I 'd like to give you back the joy that you have given me , Yet that were wishing you a need I hope will never be ; I 'd like to make you feel as rich as I , who travel on Undaunted in the darkest hours with you to lean upon .</p>
   <p>I 'm wishing at this Christmas time that I could but repay A portion of the gladness that you 've strewn along my way ; And could I have one wish this year , this only would it be : I 'd like to be the sort of friend that you have been to me .</p>

   <p>OLD FRIENDS</p>
   <p>I do not say new friends are not considerate and true , Or that their smiles ai n't genuine , but still I 'm tellin ’ you That when a feller 's heart is crushed and achin ’ with the pain , And teardrops come a-splashin ’ down his cheeks like summer rain , Becoz his grief an ’ loneliness are more than he can bear , Somehow it 's only old friends , then , that really seem to care . The friends who 've stuck through thick an ’ thin , who 've known you , good an ’ bad , Your faults an ’ virtues , an ’ have seen the struggles you have had , When they come to you gentle-like an ’ take your hand an ’ say : “ Cheer up ! we 're with you still , ” it counts , for that 's the old friends ’ way .</p>
   <p>The new friends may be fond of you for what you are to-day ; They 've only known you rich , perhaps , an ’ only seen you gay ; You can n't tell what 's attracted them ; your station may appeal ; Perhaps they smile on you because you 're doin ’ something real ; But old friends who have seen you fail , an ’ also seen you win , Who 've loved you either up or down , stuck to you , thick or thin , Who knew you as a budding youth , an ’ watched you start to climb , Through weal an ’ woe , still friends of yours an ’ constant all the time , When trouble comes an ’ things go wrong , I do n't care what you say , They are the friends you 'll turn to , for you want the old friends ’ way .</p>

   <p>THE SORROW TUGS</p>
   <p>There 's a lot of joy in the smiling world , there 's plenty of morning sun , And laughter and songs and dances , too , whenever the day 's work 's done ; Full many an hour is a shining one , when viewed by itself apart , But the golden threads in the warp of life are the sorrow tugs at your heart .</p>
   <p>Oh , the fun is froth and it blows away , and many a joy 's forgot , And the pleasures come and the pleasures go , and memory holds them not ; But treasured ever you keep the pain that causes your tears to start , For the sweetest hours are the ones that bring the sorrow tugs at your heart .</p>
   <p>The lump in your throat and the little sigh when your baby trudged away The very first time to the big red school — how long will their memory stay ? The fever days and the long black nights you watched as she troubled , slept , And the joy you felt when she smiled once more — how long will that all be kept ?</p>
   <p>The glad hours live in a feeble way , but the sad ones never die . His first long trousers caused a pang and you saw them with a sigh . And the big still house when the boy and girl , unto youth and beauty grown , To college went ; will you e'er forget that first grim hour alone ?</p>
   <p>It seems as you look back over things , that all that you treasure dear Is somehow blent in a wondrous way with a heart pang and a tear . Though many a day is a joyous one when viewed by itself apart , The golden threads in the warp of life are the sorrow tugs at your heart .</p>

   <p>IT 'S SEPTEMBER</p>
   <p>It 's September , and the orchards are afire with red and gold , And the nights with dew are heavy , and the morning 's sharp with cold ; Now the garden 's at its gayest with the salvia blazing red And the good old-fashioned asters laughing at us from their bed ; Once again in shoes and stockings are the children 's little feet , And the dog now does his snoozing on the bright side of the street .</p>
   <p>It 's September , and the cornstalks are as high as they will go , And the red cheeks of the apples everywhere begin to show ; Now the supper 's scarcely over ere the darkness settles down And the moon looms big and yellow at the edges of the town ; Oh , it 's good to see the children , when their little prayers are said , Duck beneath the patchwork covers when they tumble into bed .</p>
   <p>It 's September , and a calmness and a sweetness seem to fall Over everything that 's living , just as though it hears the call Of Old Winter , trudging slowly , with his pack of ice and snow , In the distance over yonder , and it somehow seems as though Every tiny little blossom wants to look its very best When the frost shall bite its petals and it droops away to rest .</p>
   <p>It 's September ! It 's the fullness and the ripeness of the year ; All the work of earth is finished , or the final tasks are near , But there is no doleful wailing ; every living thing that grows , For the end that is approaching wears the finest garb it knows . And I pray that I may proudly hold my head up high and smile When I come to my September in the golden afterwhile .</p>

   <p>CARE-FREE YOUTH</p>
   <p>The skies are blue and the sun is out and the grass is green and soft And the old charm 's back in the apple tree and it calls a boy aloft ; And the same low voice that the old do n't hear , but the care-free youngsters do , Is calling them to the fields and streams and the joys that once I knew . And if youth be wild desire for play and care is the mark of men , Beneath the skin that Time has tanned I 'm a madcap youngster then .</p>
   <p>Far richer than king with his crown of gold and his heavy weight of care Is the sunburned boy with his stone-bruised feet and his tousled shock of hair ; For the king can hear but the cry of hate or the sickly sound of praise , And lost to him are the voices sweet that called in his boyhood days . Far better than ruler , with pomp and power and riches , is it to be The urchin gay in his tattered clothes that is climbing the apple tree .</p>
   <p>Oh , once I heard all the calls that come to the quick , glad ears of boys , And a certain spot on the river bank told me of its many joys , And certain fields and certain trees were loyal friends to me , And I knew the birds , and I owned a dog , and we both could hear and see . Oh , never from tongues of men have dropped such messages wholly glad As the things that live in the great outdoors once told to a little lad .</p>
   <p>And I 'm sorry for him who cannot hear what the tall trees have to say , Who is deaf to the call of a running stream and the lanes that lead to play . The boy that shins up the faithful elm or sprawls on a river bank Is more richly blessed with the joys of life than any old man of rank . For youth is the golden time of life , and this battered old heart of mine Beats fast to the march of its old-time joys , when the sun begins to shine .</p>

     <l n="11">To paint the flashing tulip or the meek forget-me-not .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>May is lurking in the distance and her lap is filled with flowers , And the choicest of her blossoms very shortly will be ours . There is not a lane so dreary or a field so dark with gloom But that soon will be resplendent with its little touch of bloom . There 's an artist keen and eager to make beautiful each scene And remove with colors gorgeous every trace of of what has been .</p>
   <p>Oh , the world is now in mourning ; round about us all are spread The ruins and the symbols of the winter that is dead . But the bleak and barren picture very shortly now will pass , For the halls of life are ready for their velvet rugs of grass ; And the painters now are waiting with their magic to replace This dullness with a beauty that no mortal hand can trace .</p>
   <p>The green is in the meadow and the blue is in the sky ; The chill of death is passing , life will shortly greet the eye . We shall revel soon in colors only Nature 's artists make And the humblest plant that 's sleeping unto beauty shall awake . For there 's not a leaf forgotten , not a twig neglected there , And the tiniest of pansies shall the royal purple wear .</p>

   <p>We 've found ‘ em in the Bible , an ’ we 've found ‘ em in the flour , We 've found ‘ em in the sugar bowl , an ’ once we looked an hour Before we came across ‘ em in the padding of her chair ; An ’ many a time we 've found ‘ em in the topknot of her hair . It 's a search that ruins order an ’ the home completely wrecks , For there 's no place where you may not find poor Ma 's elusive specs .</p>
   <p>But we 're mighty glad , I tell you , that the duty 's ours to do , An ’ we hope to hunt those glasses till our time of life is through ; It 's a little bit of service that is joyous in its thrill , It 's a task that calls us daily an ’ we hope it always will . Rich or poor , the saddest mortals of all the joyless masses Are the ones who have no mother dear to lose her reading glasses .</p>

   <p>MA AND HER CHECK BOOK</p>
   <p>Ma has a dandy little book that 's full of narrow slips , An ’ when she wants to pay a bill a page from it she rips ; She just writes in the dollars and the cents and signs her name An ’ that 's as good as money , though it does n't look the same . When she wants another bonnet or some feathers for her neck , She promptly goes an ’ gets ‘ em , an ’ she writes another check . I do n't just understand it , but I know she sputters when Pa says to her at supper : “ Well ! You 're overdrawn again ! ”</p>
   <p>Ma 's not a business woman , she is much too kind of heart To squabble over pennies or to play a selfish part , An ’ when someone asks for money , she 's not one to stop an ’ think Of a little piece of paper an ’ the cost of pen an ’ ink . She just tells him very sweetly if he 'll only wait a bit An ’ be seated in the parlor , she will write a check for it . She can write one out for twenty just as easily as ten , An ’ forgets that Pa may grumble : “ Well , you 're overdrawn again ! ”</p>
   <p>Pa says it looks as though he 'll have to start in workin ’ nights To gather in the money for the checks that mother writes . He says that every morning when he 's summoned to the phone , He 's afraid the bank is calling to make mother 's shortage known . He tells his friends if ever anything our fortune wrecks They can trace it to the moment mother started writing checks . He 's got so that he trembles when he sees her fountain pen An ’ he mutters : “ Do be careful ! You 'll be overdrawn again ! ”</p>

   <p>REAL SINGING</p>
   <p>You can talk about your music , and your operatic airs , And your phonographic record that Caruso 's tenor bears ; But there is n't any music that such wondrous joy can bring Like the concert when the kiddies and their mother start to sing .</p>
   <p>When the supper time is over , then the mother starts to play Some simple little ditty , and our concert 's under way . And I 'm happier and richer than a millionaire or king When I listen to the kiddies and their mother as they sing .</p>
   <p>There 's a sweetness most appealing in the trilling of their notes : It is innocence that 's pouring from their little baby throats ; And I gaze at them enraptured , for my joy 's a real thing Every evening when the kiddies and their mother start to sing .</p>

     <l n="11">for them all .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>‘ Tis not the pomp and pride of kings that make a soldier brave ; ‘ Tis not allegiance to the flag that over him may wave ; For soldiers never fight so well on land or on the foam As when behind the cause they see the little place called home . Endanger but that humble street whereon his children run , You make a soldier of the man who never bore a gun .</p>
   <p>What is it through the battle smoke the valiant solider sees ? The little garden far away , the budding apple trees , The little patch of ground back there , the children at their play , Perhaps a tiny mound behind the simple church of gray . The golden thread of courage is n't linked to castle dome But to the spot , where'er it be — the humblest spot called home .</p>
   <p>And now the lilacs bud again and all is lovely there And homesick soldiers far away know spring is in the air ; The tulips come to bloom again , the grass once more is green , And every man can see the spot where all his joys have been . He sees his children smile at him , he hears the bugle call , And only death can stop him now — he 's fighting for them all .</p>

   <p>HOMESICK</p>
   <p>It 's tough when you are homesick in a strange and distant place ; It 's anguish when you 're hungry for an old-familiar face . And yearning for the good folks and the joys you used to know , When you 're miles away from friendship , is a bitter sort of woe . But it 's tougher , let me tell you , and a stiffer discipline To see them through the window , and to know you can n't go in .</p>
   <p>Oh , I never knew the meaning of that red sign on the door , Never really understood it , never thought of it before ; But I 'll never see another since they 've tacked one up on mine But I 'll think about the father that is barred from all that 's fine . And I 'll think about the mother who is prisoner in there So her little son or daughter shall not miss a mother 's care . And I 'll share a fellow feeling with the saddest of my kin , The dad beside the gateway of the home he can n't go in .</p>
   <p>Oh , we laugh and joke together and the mother tries to be Brave and sunny in her prison , and she thinks she 's fooling me ; And I do my bravest smiling and I feign a merry air In the hope she wo n't discover that I 'm burdened down with care . But it 's only empty laughter , and there 's nothing in the grin When you 're talking through the window of the home you can n't go in .</p>

   <p>MOTHER 'S DAY</p>
   <p>Gentle hands that never weary toiling in love 's vineyard sweet , Eyes that seem forever cheery when our eyes they chance to meet , Tender , patient , brave , devoted , this is always mother 's way , Could her worth in gold be quoted as you think of her to-day ?</p>
   <p>There shall never be another quite so tender , quite so kind As the patient little mother ; nowhere on this earth you 'll find Her affection duplicated ; none so proud if you are fine . Could her worth be overstated ? Not by any words of mine .</p>
   <p>Death stood near the hour she bore us , agony was hers to know , Yet she bravely faced it for us , smiling in her time of woe ; Down the years how oft we 've tried her , often selfish , heedless , blind , Yet with love alone to guide her she was never once unkind .</p>
   <p>Vain are all our tributes to her if in words alone they dwell . We must live the praises due her ; there 's no other way to tell Gentle mother that we love her . Would you say , as you recall All the patient service of her , you 've been worthy of it all ?</p>

    <head>GUESSING TIME</head>
    <head>It 's guessing time at our house ; every evening after tea We start guessing what old Santa 's going to leave us on our tree . Everyone of us holds secrets that the others try to steal , And that eyes and lips are plainly having trouble to conceal . And a little lip that quivered just a bit the other night Was a sad and startling warning that I must n't guess it right .</head>
     <l n="1">“ Guess what you will get for Christmas ! ” is the</l>

     <l n="5">Oh , the eyes that dance around me and the joyous</l>
     <l n="6">faces there</l>
     <l n="7">Keep me nightly guessing wildly : “ Is it something</l>
     <l n="8">I can wear ? ”</l>
     <l n="9">I implore them all to tell me in a frantic sort</l>
     <l n="10">of way</l>
     <l n="11">And pretend that I am puzzled , just to keep them</l>
     <l n="12">feeling gay .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Oh , the wise and knowing glances that across the table fly And the winks exchanged with mother , that they think I never spy ; Oh , the whispered confidences that are poured into her ear , And the laughter gay that follows when I try my best to hear ! Oh , the shouts of glad derision when I bet that it 's a cane , And the merry answering chorus : “ No , it 's not . Just guess again ! ”</p>

   <p>AN EASY WORLD</p>
   <p>It 's an easy world to live in if you choose to make it so ; You never need to suffer , save the griefs that all must know ; If you 'll stay upon the level and will do the best you can You will never lack the friendship of a kindly fellow man .</p>
   <p>Life 's an easy road to travel if you 'll only walk it straight ; When the clouds begin to gather and your hopes begin to fade , If you 've only toiled in honor you wo n't have to call for aid .</p>
   <p>But if you 've bartered friendship and the faith on which it rests For a temporary winning ; if you 've cheated in the tests , If with promises you 've broken , you have chilled the hearts of men ; It is vain to look for friendship for it will not come again .</p>
   <p>Oh , the world is full of kindness , thronged with men who want to be Of some service to their neighbors and they 'll run to you or me When we 're needing their assistance if we 've lived upon the square , But they 'll spurn us in our trouble if we 've always been unfair .</p>
   <p>It 's an easy world to live in ; all you really need to do Is the decent thing and proper and then friends will flock to you ; But let dishonor trail you and some stormy day you 'll find To your heart 's supremest sorrow that you 've made the world unkind .</p>

   <p>REVENGE</p>
   <p>If I had hatred in my heart toward my fellow man , If I were pressed to do him ill , to conjure up a plan To wound him sorely and to rob his days of all their joy , I 'd wish his wife would go away and take their little boy .</p>
   <p>I 'd waste no time on curses vague , nor try to take his gold , Nor seek to shatter any plan that he might dearly hold . A crueler revenge than that for him I would bespeak : I 'd wish his wife and little one might leave him for a week .</p>
   <p>I 'd wish him all the loneliness that comes with loss of those Who fill his life with laughter and contentment and repose . I 'd wish him empty rooms at night and mocking stairs to squeak That neither wife nor little boy will greet him for a week .</p>
   <p>If I despised my fellow man , I 'd make my hatred known By wishing him a week or two of living all alone ; I 'd let him know the torture that is mine to bear to-day , For Buddy and his mother now are miles and miles away .</p>

   <p>Be grateful for the growing trees , the roses soon to bloom , The tenderness of kindly hearts that shared your days of gloom ; Be grateful for the morning dew , the grass beneath your feet , The soft caresses of your babes and all their laughter sweet .</p>
   <p>Acquire the grateful habit , learn to see how blest you are , How much there is to gladden life , how little life to mar ! And what if rain shall fall to-day and you with grief are sad ; Be grateful that you can recall the joys that you have had .</p>

   <p>THE BOY THAT WAS</p>
   <p>When the hair about the temples starts to show the signs of gray , And a fellow realizes that he 's wandering far away From the pleasures of his boyhood and his youth , and never more Will know the joy of laughter as he did in days of yore , Oh , it 's then he starts to thinking of a stubby little lad With a face as brown as berries and a soul supremely glad .</p>
   <p>When a gray-haired dreamer wanders down the lanes of memory And forgets the living present for the time of “ used-to-be , ” He takes off his shoes and stockings , and he throws his coat away , And he 's free from all restrictions , save the rules of manly play . He may be in richest garments , but bareheaded in the sun He forgets his proud successes and the riches he has won .</p>

     <l n="1">Oh , there 's not a man alive but that would give</l>

     <l n="5">And the splendors that surround him and the</l>

     <l n="7">Only seem to rise to taunt him with the boyhood</l>
     <l n="8">that has fled .</l>
     <l n="9">When the hair about the temples starts to show</l>
     <l n="10">Time 's silver stain ,</l>
     <l n="11">Then the richest man that 's living yearns to be</l>
     <l n="12">a boy again .</l>

    <head>AS FALL THE LEAVES</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">As fall the leaves , so drop the days</l>
     <l n="2">In silence from the tree of life ;</l>
     <l n="3">Born for a little while to blaze</l>
     <l n="4">In action in the heat of strife ,</l>
     <l n="5">And then to shrivel with Time 's blast</l>
     <l n="6">And fade forever in the past .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="7">In beauty once the leaf was seen ;</l>
     <l n="8">To all it offered gentle shade ;</l>
     <l n="9">Men knew the splendor of its green</l>
     <l n="10">That cheered them so , would quickly fade :</l>
     <l n="11">And quickly , too , must pass away</l>
     <l n="12">All that is splendid of to-day .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="13">To try to keep the leaves were vain :</l>
     <l n="14">Men understand that they must fall ;</l>
     <l n="15">Why should they bitterly complain</l>
     <l n="16">When sorrows come to one and all ?</l>
     <l n="17">Why should they mourn the passing day</l>
     <l n="18">That must depart along the way ?</l>
