   <div type="introduction">
    <head>INTRODUCTION</head>
    <p n="1">I have been asked to write why I wrote this poem of “ Reynard the Fox . ” As a man grows older , life becomes more interesting but less easy to know ; for , late in life , even the strongest yields to the habit of his compartment . When he cannot range through all society , from the court to the gutter , a man must go where all society meets , as at the Pilgrimage , the Festival or the Game . Here in England the Game is both a festival and an occasion of pilgrimage . A man wanting to set down a picture of the society of England will find his models at the games .</p>
    <p n="2">What are the English games ? The man 's game is Association football ; the woman 's game , perhaps , hockey or lacrosse . Golf I regard more as a symptom of a happy marriage than a game . Cricket , which was once widely popular among both sexes has lost its hold , except among the young . The worst of all these games is that few can play them at a time .</p>
    <p n="3">But in the English country , during the autumn , winter and early spring of each year , the main sport is fox hunting , which is not like cricket or football , a game for a few and a spectacle for many , but something in which all who come may take a part , whether rich or poor , mounted or on foot . It is a sport loved and followed by both sexes , all ages and all classes . At a fox hunt , and nowhere else in England , except perhaps at a funeral , can you see the whole of the land 's society brought together , focussed for the observer , as the Canterbury pilgrims were for Chaucer .</p>
    <p n="4">This fact made the subject attractive . The fox hunt gave an opportunity for a picture or pictures of the members of an English community .</p>
    <p n="5">Then to all Englishmen who have lived in a hunting country , hunting is in the blood , and the mind is full of it . It is the most beautiful and the most stirring sight to be seen in England . In the ports , as at Falmouth , there are ships under sail , under way , coming or going , beautiful unspeakably . In the country , especially on the great fields on the lower slopes of the Downland , the teams of the ploughmen may be seen bowing forward on a sky-line , and this sight can never fail to move one by its majesty of beauty . But in neither of these sights of beauty is there the bright colour and swift excitement of the hunt , nor the thrill of the horn , and the cry of the hounds ringing into the elements of the soul . Something in the hunt wakens memories hidden in the marrow , racial memories , of when one hunted for the tribe , animal memories , perhaps , of when one hunted with the pack , or was hunted .</p>
    <p n="6">Hunting has always been popular here in England . In ancient times it was necessary . Wolves , wild boar , foxes and deer had to be kept down . To hunt was then the social duty of the mounted man , when he was not engaged in war . It was also the opportunity of all other members of the community to have a good time in the open , with a feast or a new fur at the end , to crown the pleasure .</p>
    <p n="7">Since arms of precision were made , hunting on horseback with hounds has perhaps been unnecessary everywhere , but it is not easy to end a pleasure rooted in the instincts of men . Hunting has continued , and probably will continue , in this country and in Ireland . It is rapidly becoming a national sport in the United States .</p>
    <p n="8">Some have written , that hunting is the sport of the wealthy man . Some wealthy men hunt , no doubt , but they are not the backbone of the sport , so much as those who love and use horses . Parts of this country , of Ireland and of the United States are more than ordinarily good pasture , fitted for the breeding of horses , beyond most other places in the world . Hardly anywhere else is the climate so equable , the soil so right for the feet of colts and the grass so good . Where these conditions exist , men will breed horses and use them . Men who breed good horses will ride , jump and test them , and will invent means of riding , jumping and testing them , the steeplechase , the circus , the contests at fairs and shows , the point-to-point meeting , and they will preserve , if possible , any otherwise dying sport which offers such means .</p>
    <p n="9">I have mentioned several reasons why fox hunting should be popular : ( a ) that it is a social business , at which the whole community may and does attend in vast numbers in a pleasant mood of goodwill , good humour and equality , and during which all may go anywhere , into ground otherwise shut to them ; ( b ) that it is done in the winter , at a season when other social gatherings are difficult , and in country districts where no buildings , except the churches , could contain the numbers assembled ; ( c ) that it is most beautiful to watch , so beautiful that perhaps very few of the acts of men can be so lovely to watch nor so exhilarating . The only thing to be compared with it , in this country , is the sword dance , the old heroical dancing of the young men , still practised , in all its splendour of wild beauty , in some country places ; ( d ) that we are a horse-loving people who have loved horses as we have loved the sea , and have made , in the course of generations , a breed of horse , second to none in the world , for beauty and speed .</p>
    <p n="10">But besides all these reasons , there is another that brings many out hunting . This is the delight in hunting , in the working of hounds , by themselves , or with the huntsmen , to find and kill their fox . Though many men and women hunt in order to ride , many still ride in order to hunt .</p>
    <p n="11">Perhaps this delight in hunting was more general in the mid-eighteenth century , when hounds were much slower than at present . Then , the hunt was indeed a test of hounds and huntsman . The fox was not run down but hunted down . The great run then was that in which hounds and huntsman kept to their fox . The great run now is perhaps that in which some few riders keep with the hounds .</p>
    <p n="12">The ideal run of 1750 might have been described thus :—</p>
    <p n="13">“ Being in the current of Writing , I cannot but acquaint your Lorp of ye great Hunt there was , this Tuesday last there was a a Week . Sure so great a day has not been seen here since The Day your Lorp 's Father broke his Collar Bone at ye Park Wall . As Milton says :—</p>
    <p n="14">“ Well have we speeded , and o'er Hill and Dale Forest and Field and Flood ... As far as Indus east , Euphrates west . ”</p>
    <p n="15">“ We had but dismle Weather of it , and so cold , as made Sir Harry observe , that it was an ill wind blew no-one any good . We met at ye Tailings . I had out my brown Horse . There was present Sir Anthony Smoaker ; Mr. Jarvis of Copse Stile ; William Travis ; John Hawbuck ; your Lorp 's Friend , Dick Fancowe , and two of ye Red Coats from ye Barracks . Ye fair Sex was dismayed , it was said , by ye rudeness of ye Elements ; they did not venture it .</p>
    <p n="16">“ On coming to draw Tailings Wood , Glider spoke to it , and Tom viewed him away for the Valley , being the old Dog Fox , with the white Mask , that beat us at Fubb 's Field , the day your Lorp road Bluebell .</p>
    <p n="17">“ Now spoke the chearful Horn ; and tuneful Hounds Echoed , and Red Coats gallopped ; stirring Scean , Rude Health and Manly Wit together strive .</p>
    <p n="18">“ We went with the extream of Violence from Tailings Wood to ye small Coppice at Nap Hill where a Fellow put him from his Point , which gave Occasion to Sir Anthony to correct him . Ye little magpie Hound made it out in ye bog at ye back of ye Coppice , when again Hounds went at head through Long Stone Pastures as far as Tainton . Here we was delayed in ye Dear Park , the effluvia of ye Dear being extream strong and doubtless puzzling to the Noses of ye Hounds . And here I cannot but remark the skill with which ye Hounds worked it out till they had hit it off , a sight , as Mr. Jarvis remarked to me , worthy of the Admiration of an antient Philosopher , and of the eloquence of a most elegant Wit , or Poet . Leaving ye Dear Park , He made for Norton Cross , which he left on his left Hand , as though deciding for ye Hill . Crossing ye Hill , in Spite of ye Sheep , he was a little staggered by his being run by one of ye Shepherd 's Doggs , a part of Creation that should not be tolerated , except in ye vision of ye Poet , as in a Pastoral or so . Here Joe Phillips , our Huntsman , made unavailing Casts , but by lifting to the Vineyard recovered him , when Hounds run him to Cow 's Crookham , on your Lorp 's Aston Estate .</p>
    <p n="19">“ By this Time , your Lorp will understand our Distress . Dick Fancowe was in ye Brook at Norton , Mr. Jarvis ’ grey Horse had cast a Shoe , and one of ye Red Coats had broak his Liver in falling at a Fence . For a time we went about to recover him :—</p>
    <p n="20">“ Now with attentive Nose the restless Hound Endeavours on the Scent , now here , now there , Scorning adulterat scents of lesser Prey . Now gloomy care invades the Huntsman 's Face ; And Sportsmen ( jovial erst ) on weary steeds Sit pensive . ”</p>
    <p n="21">Here might well be seen the Advantages of a judicious Breeding in Hounds , that neglects not the intellectual Part , but aims rather at a complete Animal than alone at Sinews and Corporeal Structure . That Blood of the Old Berkshire Glorious , which your Lorp 's Father was wont to observe , was what he most stood by , next to our Constitution and the Protestant Succession , here stood us in good stead , for it was to Glorious ye Ninth , as well as to Growler and Glider ( all of ye same royal strain ) that we was indebted to ye happy Conclusion . They pushed him out of ye Stubbings at Cow 's Crookham , where it seems he had taken Refuge in the Hollow of a decayed Tree . We chac't him thence upon ye Grass to Shepherd 's Hey . Here he began to run short , being not a little apprehensive , lest his Foes should triumph , and snatch from him that Life , which he had so long nefariously pampered .</p>
    <p n="22">On courtly Cock with all his household Train Of Hens obsequious , by the Hen Wife mourned .</p>
    <p n="23">“ The Sun , coming out from among ye Clouds , where he had been too long hid , made ( as was elegantly pretended by Sir Anthony ) , a Brightness , animating indeed to us , who carried the Sword of Justice , but , to the Criminal of our Pursuit , infinitely distressing . Then had your Lorp seen the gay Ardor of the Pack , as they came to the View , which they did about Stonepits , your Lorp would have said with the late elegant Poet :</p>
    <p n="24">“ Now o'er the glittering grass the sinewy Hound Shakes from his Feet the Dew and makes ye Woods resound . ”</p>
    <p n="25">“ To be brief , we killed in the Back Yard of ye Rummer and Glass after two and three quarters Hours of a Hunt such as ( all are agreed ) is not lightly to be parallelled . There was present at ye Death , beside Joe Phillips and Tom , Sir A. Smoaker , Mr. Wm . Travis and myself , all so extream distresst , Men and Beasts , that it was observed , it was a Marvel ye Horses were not dead . Such an Hunt , it was agreed , should be celebrated by an annual Dinner , at which the Toast of ye Chase might be rendered more than ordinary . Ye Hunt was upwards of Fifteen Miles in Length , and hath been the Subject of a Song , by a Member of Ye Hunt , which , as it would take long to transcribe , I forbear , hoping that we may sing it to your Lorp before ( as ye Poet says )</p>
    <p n="26">“ Ye vixen hath laid up her Cubs In snuggest Cave secure , when balmy Spring Wakens ye Meadows . ”</p>
    <p n="27">“ But to pass now from Celestial Pleasures to Worldly Cares , I have to acquaint your Lorp that your Lorp 's Sister 's Son , Mr. Parracombe , hath been killed by a Fall from his Horse , after Dinner with some Gentlemen , his particular Friends , an Affliction indeed great , humanly regarded , were it not also considered , how much happier his Lot must be , than in this Vale of Tears , etc . Ye Young Hounds thrive apace , and it is thought the forward Season will be very favourable for their future Prey . I am , your Lorp 's most obedient , Charles Cothill . ”</p>
    <p n="28">Perhaps the ideal run of the present time would be described as follows :—</p>
    <p n="29">“ A large field attended the Templecombe on Tuesday last at the popular meet at Heydigates . Will Mynors , late of the Parratts , carried the horn , in place of Tom Carling , now with Mr. Fletchers . A little time was spent in running through the shrubberies in the garden at Heydigates and then the word was given for the Cantlows . Will had no sooner put hounds into this famous cover than the dog pack proclaimed the joyous news . The fox , a traveller , was at once viewed away for the Three Oaks , across the rather heavy going of the pasture land . Coming to the Knock Brook , he swam it near Parson 's Pleasure , going at a pace that let the knowing ones know that they were in for something out of the common . Keeping Snib 's Farm on his right , he ran dead straight for Gallow 's Wood , where some woodmen with their teams disturbed him . Swinging to his left , he went up the hill , through Bloody Lane , as though towards Dinsmore , but was again deflected by woodmen . Turning down the hill , he ran for the valley , passing Enderton Schoolhouse , the scholars of which were much cheered by the near prospect of the hunt . It was now evident that he was going for the Downs . Some of the less daring began to express the hope that he might be headed .</p>
    <p n="30">“ Scent from the first was burning and the pace a cracker . After leaving Enderton he made straight for the Danesway , past Snub 's Titch and the Curlews , the green meadows of the pasture being sprinkled for miles with the relics of the field . He crossed the Roman Road at Orm 's Oak and at once entered the Danesway , going at a pace which all thought could not last .</p>
    <p n="31">“ At the summit of the Danesway , known as the Gallows Point , hounds were brought to their noses , owing to the crossing of the line by sheep . A man working nearby was able to give the line and Will , lifting beyond the Lynchets , at once hit him off , and the hounds resumed their rush . From this point , they went almost exactly straight from the head of the Danesway to the fir copse by Arthur 's Table . All this part of the run being across a rolling grass land , was at top speed , such as no horse could live with . At Arthur 's Table , he was put from his earth by shooters who were netting the warren . As he could not get through them nor across the highway , then busy with traffic , He doubled down across the Starvings , where Will , the only man up at this point , although now three hundred yards behind hounds , caught sight of him on the opposite slope , romping away from hounds as though he would never grow old . On coming to the level , past Spinney 's End , some of those who had been left at the Lynchets were able to rejoin , but were soon again cast out by the extreme violence of the going , which continued back across the Downs on a line obliquely parallel with his former track though a mile further to the south . It was supposed that he was going for the main earth in Bloody Acre Copse . Some workers in the strip at the edge of the copse headed him from this point . He swung left-handed past Staves acre , and so down to the valley by the shelving ground near Monk 's Charwell . Here , for some unaccountable reason , the scent , which had been breast high , became catchy , and hounds lost their fox in the Osier cars at Charwell Springs . Later in the afternoon , while jogging home , a second fox was chopped in Mr. Parsloe 's cover at Prince 's Charwell . Hounds then went home .</p>
    <p n="32">“ The run from the Cantlows was not remarkable for any quality of hunting , but extremely so for pace and length . The distance run , from Cantlows Wood to the Osiers cannot have been less than thirteen miles , most of it indeed on the best going in the world , but at a racing pace , with nothing that can be called a check , the whole way . Some wished that the hounds might have been rewarded and others that Will Mynors might have crowned his opening gallop with a kill , but the general feeling was one of satisfaction that so game a fox escaped . ”</p>
    <p n="33">My own interest in fox hunting began at a very early age . I was born in a good hunting country , partly woodland , partly pasture . My home , during my first seven years , was within half a mile of the kennels . I saw hounds on most days of my life . Hounds and hunting filled my imagination . I saw many meets , each as romantic as a circus . The huntsman and whipper-in seemed , then , to be the greatest men in the world , and those mild slaves , the hounds , the loveliest animals .</p>
    <p n="34">Often , as a little child , I saw and heard hounds hunting in and near a covert within sight of my old home . Once , when I was , perhaps , five years old , the fox was hunted into our garden , and those glorious beings in scarlet , as well as the hounds , were all about my lairs , like visitants from Paradise . The fox , on this occasion , went through a woodshed and escaped .</p>
    <p n="35">Later in my childhood , though I lived less near to the kennels , I was still within a mile of them , and saw hounds frequently at all seasons . In that hunting country , hunting was one of the interests of life ; everybody knew about it , loved , followed , watched and discussed it . I went to many meets , and followed many hunts on foot . Each of these occasions is now distinct in my mind , with the colour and intensity of beauty . I saw many foxes starting off upon their runs , with the hounds close behind them . It was then that I learned to admire the ease and beauty of the speed of the fresh fox . That leisurely hurry , which romps away from the hardest trained and swiftest fox hounds without a visible effort , as though the hounds were weighted with lead , is the most lovely motion I have seen in an animal .</p>
    <p n="36">No fox was the original of my Reynard , but as I was much in the woods as a boy I saw foxes fairly often , considering that they are night-moving animals . Their grace , beauty , cleverness , and secrecy always thrilled me . Then that kind of grin which the mask wears made me credit them with an almost human humour . I thought the fox a merry devil , though a bloody one . Then he is one against many , who keeps his end up , and lives , often snugly , in spite of the world . The pirate and the nightrider are nothing to the fox , for romance and danger . This way of life of his makes it difficult to observe him in a free state at close quarters .</p>
    <p n="37">Once in the early spring in the very early morning , I saw a vixen playing with her cubs in the open space below a beech tree . Once I came upon a big dog-fox in a wheel-wright 's yard , and watched him from within a few paces for some minutes . Twice I have watched half-grown cubs stalking rabbits . Twice out hunting , the fox has broken cover within three yards of me . These are the only free foxes which I have seen at close quarters . Foxes are night-moving animals . To know them well one should have cat 's eyes and foxes ’ habits . By the imagination alone can men know foxes .</p>
    <p n="38">When I was about halfway through my poem , I found a dead dog-fox in a field near Cumnor Hurst . He was a fine full-grown fox in perfect condition ; he must have picked up poison , for he had not been hunted , nor shot . On the pads of this dead fox , I noticed for the first time , the length and strength of a fox 's claws .</p>
    <p n="39">Some have asked , whether the Ghost Heath Run is founded on any recorded run of any real Hunt . It is not . It is an imaginary run , in a country made up of many different pieces of country , some of them real , some of them imaginary . These real and imaginary fields , woods and brooks are taken as they exist , from Berkshire , where the fox lives , from Herefordshire where he was found , from Trapalanda , Gloucestershire , Buckinghamshire , Herefordshire , Worcestershire and Berkshire , where he ran , from Trapalanda , where he nearly died , and from a wild and beautiful corner in Berkshire where he rests from his run .</p>
    <p n="40">Some have asked when the poem was written . It was written between January 1 and May 20 , 1919 .</p>
    <p n="41">Some have asked , whether hunting will soon be abolished . I cannot tell , but I think it unlikely . People do not willingly resign their pleasures ; men who breed horses will want to gallop them across country ; hunting is a pleasure , as well as an opportunity to gallop ; it is also an instinct in man . Some have thought that if “ small holdings , ” that is “ produce gardens , ” intensively cultivated , of about an acre apiece , became common , so that the country became more rigidly enclosed than at present , hunting would be made almost impossible . The small holding is generally the property of the small farmer ( like the French cultivateur ) who fences permanently with wire and cannot take down the wire during the hunting season , as most English farmers do at present . Small holdings will probably increase in number near towns , but farmers seem agreed that they can never become the national system of farming . The big farm , that can treat the great tract with machines , seems likely to be the farm of the future .</p>
    <p n="42">Even if the small holdings system were to prevail , it would hardly prevail over the sporting instincts of the race . Beauty and delight are stronger than the will to work . I am pretty sure that a pack of hounds , coming feathery by , at the heels of a whip 's horse , while the field takes station and the huntsman , drawing his horn , prepares to hunt , would shake the resolve of most small holders , digging in their lots with thrift , industry and self-control . And then , if the huntsman were to blow his horn , and the hounds to feather on it and give tongue , and find , and go away at head , I am pretty sure that most of the small holders of this race would follow them . It is in this race to hunt .</p>
    <p n="43">I will conclude with a portrait of old Baldy Hill , the earth-stopper , who in the darkness of the early morning gads about on a pony , to “ stop ” or “ put to ” all earths , in which a hard-pressed fox might hide . In the poem , he enters when the hunt is about to start , but he is an important figure in a hunting community , and deserves a portrait . He may come here , at the beginning , for Baldy Hill is at the beginning of all fox hunts . He dates from the beginning of Man . I have seen many a Baldy Hill in my life ; he never fails to give me the feeling that he is Primitive Man survived . Primitive Man lived like that , in the woods , in the darkness , outwitting the wild things , while the rain dripped , and the owl cried , and the ghost came out from the grave . Baldy Hill stole the last litter of the last she-wolf to cross them with the King 's hounds . He was in at the death of the last wild-boar . Sometimes , in looking at him , I think that his ashen stake must have a flint head , with which , on moony nights , he still creeps out , to rouse , it may be , the mammoth in his secret valley , or a sabretooth tiger , still caved in the woods . Life may and does shoot out into exotic forms , which may and do flower and perish . Perhaps when all the other forms of English life are gone , the Baldy Hill form , the stock form , will abide , still striding , head bent , with an ashen stake , after some wild thing , that has meat , or fur , or is difficult or dangerous to tackle .</p>
    <p n="44">Old Baldy Hill , the game old cock , Still wore knee-gaiters and a smock . He bore a five foot ashen stick All scarred and pilled from many a click Beating in covert with his sons To drive the pheasants to the guns .</p>
    <p n="45">His face was beaten by the weather To wrinkled red like bellows leather He had a cold clear hard blue eye . His snares made many a rabbit die . On moony nights he found it pleasant To stare the woods for roosting pheasant Up near the tree-trunk on the bough .</p>
    <p n="46">He never trod behind a plough . He and his two sons got their food From wild things in the field and wood , By snares , by ferrets put in holes , By ridding pasture-land of moles ; By keeping , beating , trapping , poaching And spaniel-and-retriever-coaching .</p>
    <p n="47">He and his sons had special merits In breeding and in handling ferrets Full many a snaky hob and jill Had bit the thumbs of Baldy Hill . He had no beard , but long white hair . He bent in gait . He used to wear Flowers in his smock , gold-clocks and peasen ; And spindle-fruit in hunting season .</p>
    <p n="48">I hope that he may live to wear spindle-fruit for many seasons to come . Hunting makes more people happy than anything I know . When people are happy together , I am quite certain that they build up something eternal , something both beautiful and divine , which weakens the power of all evil things upon this life of men and women .</p>

     <l n="1">The meet was at “ The Cock and Pye</l>
     <l n="2">By Charles and Martha Enderby , ”</l>
     <l n="3">The grey , three-hundred-year-old inn</l>
     <l n="4">Long since the haunt of Benjamin</l>
     <l n="5">The highwayman , who rode the bay .</l>
     <l n="6">The tavern fronts the coaching way ,</l>
     <l n="7">The mail changed horses there of old .</l>
     <l n="8">It has a strip of grassy mould</l>
     <l n="9">In front of it , a broad green strip .</l>
     <l n="10">A trough , where horses ’ muzzles dip ,</l>
     <l n="11">Stands opposite the tavern front ,</l>
     <l n="12">And there that morning came the hunt ,</l>
     <l n="13">To fill that quiet width of road</l>
     <l n="14">As full of men as Framilode</l>
     <l n="15">Is full of sea when tide is in .</l>

     <l n="18">A pad-groom gave a cloth a beating ,</l>
     <l n="19">Knocking the dust out with a stake .</l>
     <l n="20">Two men cleaned stalls with fork and rake ,</l>
     <l n="21">And one went whistling to the pump ,</l>
     <l n="22">The handle whined , ker-lump , ker-lump ,</l>
     <l n="23">The water splashed into the pail ,</l>
     <l n="24">And , as he went , it left a trail ,</l>
     <l n="25">Lipped over on the yard 's bricked paving .</l>
     <l n="26">Two grooms ( sent on before ) were shaving</l>
     <l n="27">There in the yard , at glasses propped</l>
     <l n="28">On jutting bricks ; they scraped and stropped ,</l>
     <l n="29">And felt their chins and leaned and peered ,</l>
     <l n="30">A woodland day was what they feared</l>
     <l n="31">( As second horsemen ) , shaving there .</l>
     <l n="32">Then , in the stalls where hunters were ,</l>
     <l n="33">Straw rustled as the horses shifted ,</l>
     <l n="34">The hayseeds ticked and haystraws drifted</l>
     <l n="35">From racks as horses tugged their feed .</l>
     <l n="36">Slow gulping sounds of steady greed</l>
     <l n="37">Came from each stall , and sometimes stampings ,</l>
     <l n="38">Whinnies ( at well-known steps ) and rampings</l>
     <l n="39">To see the horse in the next stall .</l>

     <l n="50">Rubbing fox-flecks out of stirrups ,</l>

     <l n="60">Of saddle-paste and polish spirit</l>

     <l n="40">Blew trumpets to the newe moon .</l>
     <l n="41">He was a bachelor , from choice .</l>
     <l n="42">He and his nephew farmed the Boyce</l>
     <l n="43">Prime pasture land for thirty cows .</l>
     <l n="44">Ock 's wife , Selina Jane , kept house ,</l>
     <l n="45">And jolly were the three together .</l>
     <l n="46">Ock had a face like summer weather ,</l>
     <l n="47">A broad red sun , split by a smile .</l>
     <l n="48">He mopped his forehead all the while ,</l>
     <l n="49">And said “ By damn , ” and “ Be n't us , Unk ? ”</l>
     <l n="50">His eyes were close and deeply sunk .</l>
     <l n="51">He cursed his hunter like a lover ,</l>
     <l n="52">“ Now blast your soul , my dear , give over .</l>
     <l n="53">Woa , now , my pretty , damn your eyes . ”</l>
     <l n="54">Like Pete he was of middle size ,</l>
     <l n="55">Dean-oak-like , stuggy , strong in shoulder ,</l>
     <l n="56">He stood a wrestle like a boulder ,</l>
     <l n="57">He had a back for pitching hay .</l>
     <l n="58">His singing voice was like a bay .</l>
     <l n="59">In talk he had a sideways spit ,</l>
     <l n="60">Each minute , to refresh his wit .</l>
     <l n="61">He cracked Brazil nuts with his teeth .</l>
     <l n="62">He challenged Cobbett of the Heath</l>
     <l n="63">( Weight-lifting champion ) once , but lost .</l>
     <l n="64">Hunting was what he loved the most ,</l>
     <l n="65">Next to his wife and Uncle Pete .</l>
     <l n="66">With beer to drink and cheese to eat ,</l>
     <l n="67">And rain in May to fill the grasses ,</l>
     <l n="68">This life was not a dream that passes</l>
