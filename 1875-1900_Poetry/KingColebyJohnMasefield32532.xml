     <l n="1">King Cole was King before the troubles came ,</l>
     <l n="2">The land was happy while he held the helm ,</l>
     <l n="3">The valley-land from Condicote to Thame ,</l>
     <l n="4">Watered by Thames and green with many an elm .</l>
     <l n="5">For many a year he governed well his realm ,</l>
     <l n="6">So well-beloved , that , when at last he died ,</l>
     <l n="7">It was bereavement to the countryside .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="8">So good , so well-beloved , had he been</l>
     <l n="9">In life , that when he reached the judging-place</l>
     <l n="10">( There where the scales are even , the sword keen ) ,</l>
     <l n="11">The Acquitting Judges granted him a grace ,</l>
     <l n="12">Aught he might choose , red , black , from king to ace ,</l>
     <l n="13">Beneath the bright arch of the heaven 's span ;</l>
     <l n="14">He chose , to wander earth , the friend of man .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="15">So , since that time , he wanders shore and shire ,</l>
     <l n="16">An old , poor , wandering man , with glittering eyes</l>
     <l n="17">Helping distressful folk to their desire</l>
     <l n="18">By power of spirit that within him lies .</l>
     <l n="19">Gentle he is , and quiet , and most wise ,</l>
     <l n="20">He wears a ragged grey , he sings sweet words ,</l>
     <l n="21">And where he walks there flutter little birds .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="22">And when the planets glow as dusk begins</l>
     <l n="23">He pipes a wooden flute to music old .</l>
     <l n="24">Men hear him on the downs , in lonely inns ,</l>
     <l n="25">In valley woods , or up the Chiltern wold ;</l>
     <l n="26">His piping feeds the starved and warms the cold ,</l>
     <l n="27">It gives the beaten courage ; to the lost</l>
     <l n="28">It brings back faith , that lodestar of the ghost .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="29">And most he haunts the beech-tree-pasturing chalk ,</l>
     <l n="30">The Downs and Chilterns with the Thames between .</l>
     <l n="31">There still the Berkshire shepherds see him walk ,</l>
     <l n="32">Searching the unhelped woe with instinct keen ,</l>
     <l n="33">His old hat stuck with never-withering green ,</l>
     <l n="34">His flute in poke , and little singings sweet</l>
     <l n="35">Coming from birds that flutter at his feet .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="36">Not long ago a circus wandered there ,</l>
     <l n="37">Where good King Cole most haunts the public way ,</l>
     <l n="38">Coming from Reading for St. Giles 's Fair</l>
     <l n="39">Through rain unceasing since Augustine 's Day ;</l>
     <l n="40">The horses spent , the waggons splashed with clay ,</l>
     <l n="41">The men with heads bowed to the wester roaring ,</l>
     <l n="42">Heaving the van-wheels up the hill at Goring .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="43">Wearily plodding up the hill they went ,</l>
     <l n="44">Broken by bitter weather and the luck ,</l>
     <l n="45">Six vans , and one long waggon with the tent ,</l>
     <l n="46">And piebald horses following in the muck ,</l>
     <l n="47">Dragging their tired hooves out with a suck ,</l>
     <l n="48">And heaving on , like some defeated tribe</l>
     <l n="49">Bound for Despair with Death upon their kibe .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="50">All through the morn the circus floundered thus ,</l>
     <l n="51">The nooning found them at the Crossing Roads ,</l>
     <l n="52">Stopped by an axle splitting in its truss .</l>
     <l n="53">The horses drooped and stared before their loads .</l>
     <l n="54">Dark with the wet they were , and cold as toads .</l>
     <l n="55">The men were busy with the foundered van ,</l>
     <l n="56">The showman stood apart , a beaten man .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="57">He did not heed the dripping of the rain ,</l>
     <l n="58">Nor the wood 's roaring , nor the blotted hill ,</l>
     <l n="59">He stood apart and bit upon his pain ,</l>
     <l n="60">Biting the bitter meal with bitter will .</l>
     <l n="61">Focussed upon himself , he stood , stock still ,</l>
     <l n="62">Staring unseeing , while his mind repeated ,</l>
     <l n="63">“ This is the end ; I 'm ruined ; I 'm defeated . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="64">From time to time a haggard woman 's face</l>
     <l n="65">Peered at him from a van , and then withdrew ;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="66">[ Illustration :</l>
     <l n="67">Within the cowboy 's van the rat-eyed wife ,</l>
     <l n="68">Her reddish hair in papers twisted close .</l>
     <l n="69">Turned wet potatoes round against the knife ,</l>
     <l n="70">And in a bucket dropped the peeled Oes .</l>
     <l n="71">]</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="72">Seeds from the hayrack blew about the place ,</l>
     <l n="73">The smoke out of the waggon chimneys blew ,</l>
     <l n="74">From wicker creel the skinny cockerel crew .</l>
     <l n="75">The men who set the floundered axle straight</l>
     <l n="76">Glanced at their chief , and each man nudged his mate .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="77">And one , the second clown , a snub-nosed youth ,</l>
     <l n="78">Fair-haired , with broken teeth , discoloured black ,</l>
     <l n="79">Muttered , “ He looks a treat , and that 's the truth .</l>
     <l n="80">I 've had enough : I 've given him the sack . ”</l>
     <l n="81">He took his wrench , arose , and stretched his back ,</l>
     <l n="82">Swore at a piebald pony trying to bite ,</l>
     <l n="83">And rolled a cigarette and begged a light .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="84">Within , the second 's wife , who leaped the hoops ,</l>
     <l n="85">Nursed sour twins , her son and jealousy ,</l>
     <l n="86">Thinking of love , in luckier , happier troupes</l>
     <l n="87">Known on the roads in summers now gone by</l>
     <l n="88">Before her husband had a roving eye ,</l>
     <l n="89">Before the rat-eyed baggage with red hair</l>
     <l n="90">Came to do tight rope and make trouble there .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="91">Beside the vans , the clown , old Circus John ,</l>
     <l n="92">Growled to the juggler as he sucked his briar ,</l>
     <l n="93">“ How all the marrow of a show was gone</l>
     <l n="94">Since women came , to sing and walk the wire ,</l>
     <l n="95">Killing the clown his act for half his hire ,</l>
     <l n="96">Killing the circus trade : because , ” said he ,</l>
     <l n="97">“ Horses and us are what men want to see . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="98">The juggler was a young man shaven-clean ,</l>
     <l n="99">Even in the mud his dainty way he had ,</l>
     <l n="100">Red-cheeked , with eyes like boxer 's , quick and keen ,</l>
     <l n="101">A jockey-looking youth with legs besprad ,</l>
     <l n="102">Humming in baritone a ditty sad ,</l>
     <l n="103">And tapping on his teeth his finger-nails ,</l>
     <l n="104">The while the clown suckt pipe and spat his tales .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="105">Molly , the singer , watched him wearily</l>
     <l n="106">With big black eyes that love had brimmed with tears ,</l>
     <l n="107">Her mop of short cut hair was blown awry ,</l>
     <l n="108">Her firm mouth shewed her wiser than her years .</l>
     <l n="109">She stroked a piebald horse and pulled his ears ,</l>
     <l n="110">And kissed his muzzle , while her eyes betrayed</l>
     <l n="111">This , that she loved the juggler , not the jade .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="112">And growling in a group the music stood</l>
     <l n="113">Sucking short pipes , their backs against the rain ,</l>
     <l n="114">Plotting rebellion in a bitter mood ,</l>
     <l n="115">“ A shilling more , or never play again . ”</l>
     <l n="116">Their old great coats were foul with many a stain ,</l>
     <l n="117">Weather and living rough had stamped their faces ,</l>
     <l n="118">They were cast clerks , old sailors , old hard cases .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="19">
     <l n="119">Within the cowboy 's van the rat-eyed wife ,</l>
     <l n="120">Her reddish hair in papers twisted close ,</l>
     <l n="121">Turned wet potatoes round against the knife ,</l>
     <l n="122">And in a bucket dropped the peeled Oes .</l>
     <l n="123">Her little girl was howling from her blows ,</l>
     <l n="124">The cowboy smoked and with a spanner whackt</l>
     <l n="125">The metal target of his shooting act .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="20">
     <l n="126">And in another van more children cried</l>
     <l n="127">From being beaten or for being chid</l>
     <l n="128">By fathers cross or mothers haggard-eyed ,</l>
     <l n="129">Made savage by the fortunes that betide .</l>
     <l n="130">The rain dripped from the waggons : the drops glid</l>
     <l n="131">Along the pony 's flanks ; the thick boots stamped</l>
     <l n="132">The running muck for warmth , and hope was damped .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="21">
     <l n="133">Yet all of that small troupe in misery stuck ,</l>
     <l n="134">Were there by virtue of their nature 's choosing</l>
     <l n="135">To be themselves and take the season 's luck ,</l>
     <l n="136">Counting the being artists worth the bruising .</l>
     <l n="137">To be themselves , as artists , even if losing</l>
     <l n="138">Wealth , comfort , health , in doing as they chose ,</l>
     <l n="139">Alone of all life 's ways brought peace to those .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="22">
     <l n="140">So there below the forlorn woods , they grumbled ,</l>
     <l n="141">Stamping for warmth and shaking off the rain .</l>
     <l n="142">Under the foundered van the tinkers fumbled ,</l>
     <l n="143">Fishing the splitted truss with wedge and chain .</l>
     <l n="144">Soon , all was done , the van could go again ,</l>
     <l n="145">Men cracked their whips , the horses ’ shoulders forged</l>
     <l n="146">Up to the collar while the mud disgorged .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="23">
     <l n="147">So with a jangling of their chains they went ,</l>
     <l n="148">Lean horses , swaying vans and creaking wheels ,</l>
     <l n="149">Bright raindrops tilting off the van roof pent</l>
     <l n="150">And reedy cockerels crying in the creels ,</l>
     <l n="151">Smoke driving down , men 's shouts and children 's squeals ,</l>
     <l n="152">Whips cracking , and the hayrack sheddings blowing ;</l>
     <l n="153">The Showman stood aside to watch them going .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="24">
     <l n="154">What with the rain and misery making mad ,</l>
     <l n="155">The Showman never saw a stranger come</l>
     <l n="156">Till there he stood , a stranger roughly clad</l>
     <l n="157">In ragged grey of woollen spun at home .</l>
     <l n="158">Green sprigs were in his hat , and other some</l>
     <l n="159">Stuck in his coat ; he bore a wooden flute ,</l>
     <l n="160">And redbreasts hopped and carolled at his foot .</l>

     <l n="916">Had crowned their loves with never-withering green .</l>
