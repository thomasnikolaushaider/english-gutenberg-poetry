    <head>I . PEACE</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Now , God be thanked Who has matched us with His hour ,</l>
     <l n="2">And caught our youth , and wakened us from sleeping ,</l>
     <l n="3">With hand made sure , clear eye , and sharpened power ,</l>
     <l n="4">To turn , as swimmers into cleanness leaping ,</l>
     <l n="5">Glad from a world grown old and cold and weary ,</l>
     <l n="6">Leave the sick hearts that honour could not move ,</l>
     <l n="7">And half-men , and their dirty songs and dreary ,</l>
     <l n="8">And all the little emptiness of love !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">Oh ! we , who have known shame , we have found release there ,</l>
     <l n="10">Where there 's no ill , no grief , but sleep has mending ,</l>
     <l n="11">Naught broken save this body , lost but breath ;</l>
     <l n="12">Nothing to shake the laughing heart 's long peace there</l>
     <l n="13">But only agony , and that has ending ;</l>
     <l n="14">And the worst friend and enemy is but Death .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="part" n="1">
     <head>II . SAFETY</head>
     <lg type="stanza" n="3">
      <l n="15">Dear ! of all happy in the hour , most blest</l>
      <l n="16">He who has found our hid security ,</l>
      <l n="17">Assured in the dark tides of the world that rest ,</l>
      <l n="18">And heard our word , ‘ Who is so safe as we ? ’</l>
      <l n="19">We have found safety with all things undying ,</l>
      <l n="20">The winds , and morning , tears of men and mirth ,</l>
      <l n="21">The deep night , and birds singing , and clouds flying ,</l>
      <l n="22">And sleep , and freedom , and the autumnal earth .</l>
      <l n="23">We have built a house that is not for Time 's throwing .</l>
      <l n="24">We have gained a peace unshaken by pain for ever .</l>
      <l n="25">War knows no power . Safe shall be my going ,</l>
      <l n="26">Secretly armed against all death 's endeavour ;</l>
      <l n="27">Safe though all safety 's lost ; safe where men fall ;</l>
      <l n="28">And if these poor limbs die , safest of all .</l>

     <head>III . THE DEAD</head>
     <lg type="stanza" n="4">
      <l n="29">Blow out , you bugles , over the rich Dead !</l>
      <l n="30">There 's none of these so lonely and poor of old ,</l>
      <l n="31">But , dying , has made us rarer gifts than gold .</l>
      <l n="32">These laid the world away ; poured out the red</l>
      <l n="33">Sweet wine of youth ; gave up the years to be</l>
      <l n="34">Of work and joy , and that unhoped serene ,</l>
      <l n="35">That men call age ; and those who would have been ,</l>
      <l n="36">Their sons , they gave , their immortality .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="5">
      <l n="37">Blow , bugles , blow ! They brought us , for our dearth ,</l>
      <l n="38">Holiness , lacked so long , and Love , and Pain .</l>
      <l n="39">Honour has come back , as a king , to earth ,</l>
      <l n="40">And paid his subjects with a royal wage ;</l>
      <l n="41">And Nobleness walks in our ways again ;</l>
      <l n="42">And we have come into our heritage .</l>
     </lg>

    <lg type="part" n="3">
     <head>IV . THE DEAD</head>
     <lg type="stanza" n="6">
      <l n="43">These hearts were woven of human joys and cares ,</l>
      <l n="44">Washed marvellously with sorrow , swift to mirth .</l>
      <l n="45">The years had given them kindness . Dawn was theirs ,</l>
      <l n="46">And sunset , and the colours of the earth .</l>
      <l n="47">These had seen movement , and heard music ; known</l>
      <l n="48">Slumber and waking ; loved ; gone proudly friended ;</l>
      <l n="49">Felt the quick stir of wonder ; sat alone ;</l>
      <l n="50">Touched flowers and furs and cheeks . All this is ended .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="7">
      <l n="51">There are waters blown by changing winds to laughter</l>
      <l n="52">And lit by the rich skies , all day . And after ,</l>
      <l n="53">Frost , with a gesture , stays the waves that dance</l>
      <l n="54">And wandering loveliness . He leaves a white</l>
      <l n="55">Unbroken glory , a gathered radiance ,</l>
      <l n="56">A width , a shining peace , under the night .</l>

     <head>V. THE SOLDIER</head>
     <lg type="stanza" n="8">
      <l n="57">If I should die , think only this of me :</l>
      <l n="58">That there 's some corner of a foreign field</l>
      <l n="59">That is for ever England . There shall be</l>
      <l n="60">In that rich earth a richer dust concealed ;</l>
      <l n="61">A dust whom England bore , shaped , made aware ,</l>
      <l n="62">Gave , once , her flowers to love , her ways to roam ,</l>
      <l n="63">A body of England 's , breathing English air ,</l>
      <l n="64">Washed by the rivers , blest by suns of home .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="9">
      <l n="65">And think , this heart , all evil shed away ,</l>
      <l n="66">A pulse in the eternal mind , no less</l>
      <l n="67">Gives somewhere back the thoughts by England given ;</l>
      <l n="68">Her sights and sounds ; dreams happy as her day ;</l>
      <l n="69">And laughter , learnt of friends ; and gentleness ,</l>
      <l n="70">In hearts at peace , under an English heaven .</l>

   <lg type="poem">
    <head>THE TREASURE</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">When colour goes home into the eyes ,</l>
     <l n="2">And lights that shine are shut again</l>
     <l n="3">With dancing girls and sweet birds ’ cries</l>
     <l n="4">Behind the gateways of the brain ;</l>
     <l n="5">And that no-place which gave them birth , shall close</l>
     <l n="6">The rainbow and the rose :—</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="7">Still may Time hold some golden space</l>
     <l n="8">Where I 'll unpack that scented store</l>
     <l n="9">Of song and flower and sky and face ,</l>
     <l n="10">And count , and touch , and turn them o'er ,</l>
     <l n="11">Musing upon them ; as a mother , who</l>
     <l n="12">Has watched her children all the rich day through</l>
     <l n="13">Sits , quiet-handed , in the fading light ,</l>
     <l n="14">When children sleep , ere night .</l>

    <head>TIARE TAHITI</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Mamua , when our laughter ends ,</l>
     <l n="2">And hearts and bodies , brown as white ,</l>
     <l n="3">Are dust about the doors of friends ,</l>
     <l n="4">Or scent ablowing down the night ,</l>
     <l n="5">Then , oh ! then , the wise agree ,</l>
     <l n="6">Comes our immortality .</l>
     <l n="7">Mamua , there waits a land</l>
     <l n="8">Hard for us to understand .</l>
     <l n="9">Out of time , beyond the sun ,</l>
     <l n="10">All are one in Paradise ,</l>
     <l n="11">You and Pupure are one ,</l>
     <l n="12">And Taue , and the ungainly wise .</l>
     <l n="13">There the Eternals are , and there</l>
     <l n="14">The Good , the Lovely , and the True ,</l>
     <l n="15">And Types , whose earthly copies were</l>
     <l n="16">The foolish broken things we knew ;</l>
     <l n="17">There is the Face , whose ghosts we are ;</l>

     <l n="20">Faint and fading shadows here ;</l>
     <l n="21">Never a tear , but only Grief ;</l>
     <l n="22">Dance , but not the limbs that move ;</l>
     <l n="23">Songs in Song shall disappear ;</l>
     <l n="24">Instead of lovers , Love shall be ;</l>
     <l n="25">For hearts , Immutability ;</l>
     <l n="26">And there , on the Ideal Reef ,</l>
     <l n="27">Thunders the Everlasting Sea !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="28">And my laughter , and my pain ,</l>

     <l n="33">And the hands of Matua ,</l>
     <l n="34">Stars and sunlight there shall meet ,</l>
     <l n="35">Coral 's hues and rainbows there ,</l>
     <l n="36">And Teuera 's braided hair ;</l>
     <l n="37">And with the starred tiare 's white ,</l>
     <l n="38">And white birds in the dark ravine ,</l>
     <l n="39">And flamboyants ablaze at night ,</l>
     <l n="40">And jewels , and evening 's after-green ,</l>
     <l n="41">And dawns of pearl and gold and red ,</l>
     <l n="42">Mamua , your lovelier head !</l>
     <l n="43">And there 'll no more be one who dreams</l>
     <l n="44">Under the ferns , of crumbling stuff ,</l>
     <l n="45">Eyes of illusion , mouth that seems ,</l>
     <l n="46">All time-entangled human love .</l>
     <l n="47">And you 'll no longer swing and sway</l>
     <l n="48">Divinely down the scented shade ,</l>
     <l n="49">Where feet to Ambulation fade ,</l>
     <l n="50">And moons are lost in endless Day .</l>
     <l n="51">How shall we wind these wreaths of ours ,</l>
     <l n="52">Where there are neither heads nor flowers ?</l>
     <l n="53">Oh , Heaven 's Heaven !— but we 'll be missing</l>
     <l n="54">The palms , and sunlight , and the south ;</l>
     <l n="55">And there 's an end , I think , of kissing ,</l>
     <l n="56">When our mouths are one with Mouth ....</l>

     <l n="61">About the idle warm lagoon .</l>
     <l n="62">Hasten , hand in human hand ,</l>
     <l n="63">Down the dark , the flowered way ,</l>
     <l n="64">Along the whiteness of the sand ,</l>
     <l n="65">And in the water 's soft caress ,</l>
     <l n="66">Wash the mind of foolishness ,</l>
     <l n="67">Mamua , until the day .</l>
     <l n="68">Spend the glittering moonlight there</l>
     <l n="69">Pursuing down the soundless deep</l>
     <l n="70">Limbs that gleam and shadowy hair ,</l>
     <l n="71">Or floating lazy , half-asleep .</l>
     <l n="72">Dive and double and follow after ,</l>
     <l n="73">Snare in flowers , and kiss , and call ,</l>
     <l n="74">With lips that fade , and human laughter</l>

    <head>RETROSPECT</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">In your arms was still delight ,</l>
     <l n="2">Quiet as a street at night ;</l>
     <l n="3">And thoughts of you , I do remember ,</l>
     <l n="4">Were green leaves in a darkened chamber ,</l>
     <l n="5">Were dark clouds in a moonless sky .</l>
     <l n="6">Love , in you , went passing by ,</l>
     <l n="7">Penetrative , remote , and rare ,</l>
     <l n="8">Like a bird in the wide air ,</l>
     <l n="9">And , as the bird , it left no trace</l>
     <l n="10">In the heaven of your face .</l>
     <l n="11">In your stupidity I found</l>
     <l n="12">The sweet hush after a sweet sound .</l>
     <l n="13">All about you was the light</l>
     <l n="14">That dims the greying end of night ;</l>
     <l n="15">Desire was the unrisen sun ,</l>
     <l n="16">Joy the day not yet begun ,</l>
     <l n="17">With tree whispering to tree ,</l>
     <l n="18">Without wind , quietly .</l>
     <l n="19">Wisdom slept within your hair ,</l>
     <l n="20">And Long-Suffering was there ,</l>
     <l n="21">And , in the flowing of your dress ,</l>
     <l n="22">Undiscerning Tenderness .</l>
     <l n="23">And when you thought , it seemed to me ,</l>
     <l n="24">Infinitely , and like a sea ,</l>
     <l n="25">About the slight world you had known</l>
     <l n="26">Your vast unconsciousness was thrown ....</l>

     <l n="30">And home at length under the hill !</l>
     <l n="31">O mother quiet , breasts of peace ,</l>
     <l n="32">Where love itself would faint and cease !</l>
     <l n="33">O infinite deep I never knew ,</l>

     <l n="36">Kneel down by you , and never a word ,</l>
     <l n="37">Lay my head , and nothing said ,</l>
     <l n="38">In your hands , ungarlanded ;</l>
     <l n="39">And a long watch you would keep ;</l>

    <head>THE GREAT LOVER</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">I have been so great a lover : filled my days</l>
     <l n="2">So proudly with the splendour of Love 's praise ,</l>
     <l n="3">The pain , the calm , and the astonishment ,</l>
     <l n="4">Desire illimitable , and still content ,</l>
     <l n="5">And all dear names men use , to cheat despair ,</l>
     <l n="6">For the perplexed and viewless streams that bear</l>
     <l n="7">Our hearts at random down the dark of life .</l>
     <l n="8">Now , ere the unthinking silence on that strife</l>
     <l n="9">Steals down , I would cheat drowsy Death so far ,</l>
     <l n="10">My night shall be remembered for a star</l>
     <l n="11">That outshone all the suns of all men 's days .</l>
     <l n="12">Shall I not crown them with immortal praise</l>

     <l n="30">Of friendly bread ; and many-tasting food ;</l>
     <l n="31">Rainbows ; and the blue bitter smoke of wood ;</l>
     <l n="32">And radiant raindrops couching in cool flowers ;</l>
     <l n="33">And flowers themselves , that sway through sunny hours ,</l>
     <l n="34">Dreaming of moths that drink them under the moon ;</l>
     <l n="35">Then , the cool kindliness of sheets , that soon</l>
     <l n="36">Smooth away trouble ; and the rough male kiss</l>
     <l n="37">Of blankets ; grainy wood ; live hair that is</l>
     <l n="38">Shining and free ; blue-massing clouds ; the keen</l>
     <l n="39">Unpassioned beauty of a great machine ;</l>
     <l n="40">The benison of hot water ; furs to touch ;</l>
     <l n="41">The good smell of old clothes ; and other such —</l>
     <l n="42">The comfortable smell of friendly fingers ,</l>
     <l n="43">Hair 's fragrance , and the musty reek that lingers</l>
     <l n="44">About dead leaves and last year 's ferns ....</l>

     <l n="46">And thousand other throng to me ! Royal flames ;</l>
     <l n="47">Sweet water 's dimpling laugh from tap or spring ;</l>
     <l n="48">Holes in the ground ; and voices that do sing ;</l>
     <l n="49">Voices in laughter , too ; and body 's pain ,</l>
     <l n="50">Soon turned to peace ; and the deep-panting train ;</l>
     <l n="51">Firm sands ; the little dulling edge of foam</l>
     <l n="52">That browns and dwindles as the wave goes home ;</l>
     <l n="53">And washen stones , gay for an hour ; the cold</l>
     <l n="54">Graveness of iron ; moist black earthen mould ;</l>
     <l n="55">Sleep ; and high places ; footprints in the dew ;</l>
     <l n="56">And oaks ; and brown horse-chestnuts , glossy-new ;</l>
     <l n="57">And new-peeled sticks ; and shining pools on grass ;—</l>

     <l n="59">Whatever passes not , in the great hour ,</l>
     <l n="60">Nor all my passion , all my prayers , have power</l>

     <l n="62">They 'll play deserter , turn with the traitor breath ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Young Mary , loitering once her garden way ,</l>
     <l n="2">Felt a warm splendour grow in the April day ,</l>
     <l n="3">As wine that blushes water through . And soon ,</l>
     <l n="4">Out of the gold air of the afternoon ,</l>
     <l n="5">One knelt before her : hair he had , or fire ,</l>
     <l n="6">Bound back above his ears with golden wire ,</l>
     <l n="7">Baring the eager marble of his face .</l>
     <l n="8">Not man 's nor woman 's was the immortal grace</l>
     <l n="9">Rounding the limbs beneath that robe of white ,</l>
     <l n="10">And lighting the proud eyes with changeless light ,</l>
     <l n="11">Incurious . Calm as his wings , and fair ,</l>
     <l n="12">That presence filled the garden .</l>
     <l n="13">She stood there ,</l>
     <l n="14">Saying , “ What would you , Sir ? ”</l>
     <l n="15">He told his word ,</l>
     <l n="16">“ Blessed art thou of women ! ” Half she heard ,</l>
     <l n="17">Hands folded and face bowed , half long had known ,</l>
     <l n="18">The message of that clear and holy tone ,</l>
     <l n="19">That fluttered hot sweet sobs about her heart ;</l>
     <l n="20">Such serene tidings moved such human smart .</l>
     <l n="21">Her breath came quick as little flakes of snow .</l>
     <l n="22">Her hands crept up her breast . She did but know</l>
     <l n="23">It was not hers . She felt a trembling stir</l>
     <l n="24">Within her body , a will too strong for her</l>
     <l n="25">That held and filled and mastered all . With eyes</l>
     <l n="26">Closed , and a thousand soft short broken sighs ,</l>
     <l n="27">She gave submission ; fearful , meek , and glad ....</l>
     <l n="28">She wished to speak . Under her breasts she had</l>
     <l n="29">Such multitudinous burnings , to and fro ,</l>
     <l n="30">And throbs not understood ; she did not know</l>
     <l n="31">If they were hurt or joy for her ; but only</l>
     <l n="32">That she was grown strange to herself , half lonely ,</l>
     <l n="33">All wonderful , filled full of pains to come</l>
     <l n="34">And thoughts she dare not think , swift thoughts and dumb ,</l>
     <l n="35">Human , and quaint , her own , yet very far ,</l>
     <l n="36">Divine , dear , terrible , familiar ...</l>
     <l n="37">Her heart was faint for telling ; to relate</l>
     <l n="38">Her limbs ’ sweet treachery , her strange high estate ,</l>
     <l n="39">Over and over , whispering , half revealing ,</l>
     <l n="40">Weeping ; and so find kindness to her healing .</l>
     <l n="41">‘ Twixt tears and laughter , panic hurrying her ,</l>
     <l n="42">She raised her eyes to that fair messenger .</l>
     <l n="43">He knelt unmoved , immortal ; with his eyes</l>
     <l n="44">Gazing beyond her , calm to the calm skies ;</l>
     <l n="45">Radiant , untroubled in his wisdom , kind .</l>
     <l n="46">His sheaf of lilies stirred not in the wind .</l>
     <l n="47">How should she , pitiful with mortality ,</l>
     <l n="48">Try the wide peace of that felicity</l>
     <l n="49">With ripples of her perplexed shaken heart ,</l>
     <l n="50">And hints of human ecstasy , human smart ,</l>
     <l n="51">And whispers of the lonely weight she bore ,</l>
     <l n="52">And how her womb within was hers no more</l>
     <l n="53">And at length hers ?</l>
     <l n="54">Being tired , she bowed her head ;</l>
     <l n="55">And said , “ So be it ! ”</l>
     <l n="56">The great wings were spread</l>
     <l n="57">Showering glory on the fields , and fire .</l>
     <l n="58">The whole air , singing , bore him up , and higher ,</l>
     <l n="59">Unswerving , unreluctant . Soon he shone</l>

     <l n="6">And laughed with him and sung with him and wasted ,</l>
     <l n="7">In feast and wine and many-crown 'd carouse ,</l>
     <l n="8">The days and nights and dawnings of the time</l>
     <l n="9">When Youth kept open house ,</l>
     <l n="10">Nor left untasted</l>
     <l n="11">Aught of his high emprise and ventures dear ,</l>
     <l n="12">No quest of his unshar 'd —</l>
     <l n="13">All these , with loitering feet and sad head bar 'd ,</l>
     <l n="14">Followed their old friend 's bier .</l>
     <l n="15">Folly went first ,</l>
     <l n="16">With muffled bells and coxcomb still revers 'd ;</l>
     <l n="17">And after trod the bearers , hat in hand —</l>
     <l n="18">Laughter , most hoarse , and Captain Pride with tanned</l>
     <l n="19">And martial face all grim , and fussy Joy ,</l>

     <l n="28">( The sweet lad Rhyme ) , ran all-uncomprehending .</l>
     <l n="29">Then , at the way 's sad ending ,</l>
     <l n="30">Round the raw grave they stay 'd . Old Wisdom read ,</l>
     <l n="31">In mumbling tone , the Service for the Dead .</l>
     <l n="32">There stood Romance ,</l>
     <l n="33">The furrowing tears had mark 'd her rouged cheek ;</l>

     <l n="35">Dead Innocency 's daughter , Ignorance ;</l>

     <l n="39">And Friendship — not a minute older , she ;</l>
     <l n="40">Impatience , ever taking out his watch ;</l>
     <l n="41">Faith , who was deaf , and had to lean , to catch</l>
     <l n="42">Old Wisdom 's endless drone .</l>
     <l n="43">Beauty was there ,</l>
     <l n="44">Pale in her black ; dry-eyed ; she stood alone .</l>
     <l n="45">Poor maz 'd Imagination ; Fancy wild ;</l>
     <l n="46">Ardour , the sunlight on his greying hair ;</l>
     <l n="47">Contentment , who had known Youth as a child</l>
     <l n="48">And never seen him since . And Spring came too ,</l>
     <l n="49">Dancing over the tombs , and brought him flowers —</l>
     <l n="50">She did not stay for long .</l>
     <l n="51">And Truth , and Grace , and all the merry crew ,</l>
     <l n="52">The laughing Winds and Rivers , and lithe Hours ;</l>

     <l n="24">Drink beer around ;— and there the dews</l>

     <l n="26">Here tulips bloom as they are told ;</l>
     <l n="27">Unkempt about those hedges blows</l>
     <l n="28">An English unofficial rose ;</l>
     <l n="29">And there the unregulated sun</l>
     <l n="30">Slopes down to rest when day is done ,</l>
     <l n="31">And wakes a vague unpunctual star ,</l>
     <l n="32">A slippered Hesper ; and there are</l>

     <l n="38">With Nature there , or Earth , or such .</l>
     <l n="39">And clever modern men have seen</l>
     <l n="40">A Faun a-peeping through the green ,</l>
     <l n="41">And felt the Classics were not dead ,</l>

     <l n="55">Dan Chaucer hears his river still</l>
     <l n="56">Chatter beneath a phantom mill .</l>

     <l n="62">A hundred Vicars down the lawn ;</l>

     <l n="64">On lissom , clerical , printless toe ;</l>

     <l n="66">The sly shade of a Rural Dean ...</l>
     <l n="67">Till , at a shiver in the skies ,</l>
     <l n="68">Vanishing with Satanic cries ,</l>
     <l n="69">The prim ecclesiastic rout</l>
