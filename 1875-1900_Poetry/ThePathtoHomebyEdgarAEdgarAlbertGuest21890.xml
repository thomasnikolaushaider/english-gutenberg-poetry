    <docTitle><titlePart>The Path to Home There 's the mother at the doorway , and the children at the gate , And the little parlor windows with the curtains white and straight . There are shaggy asters blooming in the bed that lines the fence , And the simplest of the blossoms seems of mighty consequence . Oh , there is n't any mansion underneath God 's starry dome That can rest a weary pilgrim like the little place called home . Men have sought for gold and silver ; men have dreamed at night of fame ; In the heat of youth they 've struggled for achievement 's honored name ; But the selfish crowns are tinsel , and their shining jewels paste , And the wine of pomp and glory soon grows bitter to the taste . For there 's never any laughter , howsoever far you roam , Like the laughter of the loved ones in the happiness of home . There is nothing so important as the mother 's lullabies , Filled with peace and sweet contentment , when the moon begins to rise — Nothing real except the beauty and the calm upon her face And the shouting of the children as they scamper round the place . For the greatest of man 's duties is to keep his loved ones glad And to have his children glory in the father they have had . So where'er a man may wander , and whatever be his care , You 'll find his soul still stretching to the home he left somewhere . You 'll find his dreams all tangled up with hollyhocks in bloom , And the feet of little children that go racing through a room , With the happy mother smiling as she watches them at play — These are all in life that matter , when you 've stripped the sham away .</titlePart></docTitle>

     <p>Who shall sit at the table , then , when the terms of peace are made — The wisest men of the troubled lands in their silver and gold brocade ? Yes , they shall gather in solemn state to speak for each living race , But who shall speak for the unseen dead that shall come to the council place ?</p>
     <p>Though you see them not and you hear them not , they shall sit at the table , too ; They shall throng the room where the peace is made and know what it is you do ; The innocent dead from the sea shall rise to stand at the wise man 's side , And over his shoulder a boy shall look — a boy that was crucified .</p>
     <p>You may guard the doors of that council hall with barriers strong and stout , But the dead unbidden shall enter there , and never you 'll shut them out . And the man that died in the open boat , and the babes that suffered worse , Shall sit at the table when peace is made by the side of a martyred nurse .</p>
     <p>You may see them not , but they 'll all be there ; when they speak you may fail to hear ; You may think that you 're making your pacts alone , but their spirits will hover near ; And whatever the terms of the peace you make with the tyrant whose hands are red , You must please not only the living here , but must satisfy your dead .</p>

       <l n="2">Last night I caught him on his knees and looking underneath the bed ,</l>
       <l n="3">And oh , the guilty look he wore , and oh , the stammered words he said ,</l>
       <l n="4">When I , pretending to be cross , said : “ Hey , young fellow , what 's your</l>
       <l n="5">game ? ”</l>
       <l n="6">As if , back in the long ago , I had n't also played the same ;</l>
       <l n="7">As if , upon my hands and knees , I had n't many a time been found</l>
       <l n="8">When , thinking of the Christmas Day , I 'd gone upstairs to snoop around .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="9">But there he stood and hung his head ; the rascal knew it was n't fair .</l>
       <l n="10">“ I jes ’ was wonderin ’ , ” he said , “ jes ’ what it was that 's under there .</l>
       <l n="11">It 's somepin ’ all wrapped up an ’ I thought mebbe it might be a sled ,</l>
       <l n="12">Becoz I saw a piece of wood ‘ at 's stickin ’ out all painted red . ”</l>
       <l n="13">“ If mother knew , ” I said to him , “ you 'd get a licking , I 'll be bound ,</l>
       <l n="14">But just clear out of here at once , and do n't you ever snoop around . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="15">And as he scampered down the stairs I stood and chuckled to myself ,</l>
       <l n="16">As I remembered how I 'd oft explored the topmost closet shelf .</l>
       <l n="17">It all came back again to me — with what a shrewd and cunning way</l>
       <l n="18">I , too , had often sought to solve the mysteries of Christmas Day .</l>
       <l n="19">How many times my daddy , too , had come upstairs without a sound</l>
       <l n="20">And caught me , just as I 'd begun my clever scheme to snoop around .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="21">And oh , I envied him his plight ; I envied him the joy he feels</l>
       <l n="22">Who knows that every drawer that 's locked some treasure dear to him</l>
       <l n="23">conceals ;</l>
       <l n="24">I envied him his Christmas fun and wished that it again were mine</l>
       <l n="25">To seek to solve the mysteries by paper wrapped and bound by twine .</l>
       <l n="26">Some day he 'll come to understand that all the time I stood and frowned ,</l>
       <l n="27">I saw a boy of years ago who also used to snoop around .</l>

     <p>Sure , they get stubborn at times ; they worry and fret us a lot , But I 'd rather be crossed by a glad little boy and frequently worried than not . There are hours when they get on my nerves and set my poor brain all awhirl , But I 'd rather be troubled that way than to be the man who has no little girl .</p>
     <p>There are times they 're a nuisance , that 's true , with all of their racket and noise , But I 'd rather my personal pleasures be lost than to give up my girls and my boys . Not always they 're perfectly good ; there are times when they 're wilfully bad , But I 'd rather be worried by youngsters of mine than lonely and childless and sad .</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">So I try to be patient and calm whenever they 're</l>
       <l n="2">having their fling ;</l>
       <l n="3">For the sum of their laughter and love is more</l>
       <l n="4">than the worry they bring .</l>
       <l n="5">And each night when sweet peace settles down</l>
       <l n="6">and I see them asleep in their cot ,</l>
       <l n="7">I chuckle and say : “ They upset me to-day , but</l>

       <l n="92">When bathrooms were exceptions , and we got our weekly scrub</l>

       <l n="102">But if the nights were very cold , by closing every door</l>
       <l n="103">We were allowed to take our bath upon the kitchen floor .</l>
       <l n="104">Beside the cheery stove we stood and gave ourselves a rub ,</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="15">
       <l n="106">But modern homes no more go through that joyous weekly fun ,</l>
       <l n="107">And through the sitting rooms at night no half-dried children run ;</l>
       <l n="108">No little flying forms go past , too swift to see their charms ,</l>
       <l n="109">With shirts and underwear and things tucked underneath their arms ;</l>
       <l n="110">The home 's so full of luxury now , it 's almost like a club ,</l>

     <p>“ I 'm never alone in the garden , ” he said . “ I 'm never alone with the flowers . It seems like I 'm meeting the wonderful dead out here with these blossoms of ours . An ’ there 's never a bush or a plant or a tree , but somebody loved it of old . An ’ the souls of the angels come talkin ’ to me through the petals of crimson an ’ gold .</p>
     <p>“ The lilacs in spring bring the mother once more , an ’ she lives in the midsummer rose . She smiles in the peony clump at the door , an ’ sings when the four o'clocks close . She loved every blossom God gave us to own , an ’ daily she gave it her care . So never I walk in the garden alone , for I feel that the mother 's still there .</p>
     <p>“ These are the pinks that a baby once kissed , still spicy with fragrance an ’ fair . The years have been long since her laughter I 've missed , but her spirit is hovering there . The roses that ramble and twine on the wall were planted by one that was kind An ’ I 'm sure as I stand here an ’ gaze on them all , that his soul has still lingered behind .</p>
     <p>“ I 'm never alone in the garden , ” he said , “ I have many to talk with an ’ see , For never a flower comes to bloom in its bed , but it brings back a loved one to me . An ’ I fancy whenever I 'm bendin ’ above these blossoms of crimson an ’ gold , That I 'm seein ’ an ’ hearin ’ the ones that I love , who lived in the glad days of old . ”</p>

       <l n="14">A convalescin ’ woman does the strangest sort o ’ things ,</l>
       <l n="15">An ’ it 's wonderful the courage that a little new strength brings ;</l>
       <l n="16">O , it 's never safe to leave her for an hour or two alone ,</l>
       <l n="17">Or you 'll find th ’ doctor 's good work has been quickly overthrown .</l>
       <l n="18">There 's that wife o ’ mine , I reckon she 's a sample of ‘ em all ;</l>
       <l n="19">She 's been mighty sick , I tell you , an ’ to-day can scarcely crawl ,</l>
       <l n="20">But I left her jes ’ this mornin ’ while I fought potater bugs ,</l>
       <l n="21">An ’ I got back home an ’ caught her in the back yard shakin ’ rugs .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="22">I ai n't often cross with Nellie , an ’ I let her have her way ,</l>
       <l n="23">But it made me mad as thunder when I got back home to-day</l>
       <l n="24">An ’ found her doin ’ labor that 'd tax a big man 's strength ;</l>
       <l n="25">An ’ I guess I lost my temper , for I scolded her at length ,</l>
       <l n="26">‘ Til I seen her teardrops fallin ’ an ’ she said : “ I could n't stand</l>
       <l n="27">To see those rugs so dirty , so I took ‘ em all in hand ,</l>
       <l n="28">An ’ it ai n't hurt me nuther — see , I 'm gettin ’ strong again — ”</l>
       <l n="29">An ’ I said : “ Doggone it ! can n't ye leave sich work as that fer men ? ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="30">Once I had her in a hospittle fer weeks an ’ weeks an ’ weeks ,</l>
       <l n="31">An ’ she wasted most to nothin ’ , an ’ th ’ roses left her cheeks ;</l>
       <l n="32">An ’ one night I feared I 'd lose her ; ‘ twas the turnin ’ point , I guess ,</l>
       <l n="33">Coz th ’ next day I remember that th ’ doctor said : “ Success ! ”</l>
       <l n="34">Well , I brought her home an ’ told her that for two months she must stay</l>
       <l n="35">A-sittin ’ in her rocker an ’ jes ’ watch th ’ kids at play .</l>
       <l n="36">An ’ th ’ first week she was patient , but I mind the way I swore</l>
       <l n="37">On th ’ day when I discovered ‘ at she 'd scrubbed th ’ kitchen floor .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="38">O , you can n't keep wimmin quiet , an ’ they ai n't a bit like men ;</l>
       <l n="39">They 're hungerin ’ every minute jes ’ to get to work again ;</l>
       <l n="40">An ’ you 've got to watch ‘ em allus , when you know they 're weak an ’ ill ,</l>
       <l n="41">Coz th ’ minute that yer back is turned they 'll labor fit to kill .</l>
       <l n="42">Th ’ house ai n't cleaned to suit ‘ em an ’ they seem to fret an ’ fume</l>
       <l n="43">‘ Less they 're busy doin ’ somethin ’ with a mop or else a broom ;</l>
       <l n="44">An ’ it ai n't no use to scold ‘ em an ’ it ai n't no use to swear ,</l>
       <l n="45">Coz th ’ next time they will do it jes ’ the minute you ai n't there .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="47">Whenever I walk through God 's Acres of Dead</l>
       <l n="48">I wonder how often the mute voices said :</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="9">
       <l n="51">I wonder how many fine thoughts unexpressed</l>
       <l n="52">Were lost to the world when they went to their rest ;</l>
       <l n="53">I wonder what beautiful deeds they 'd have done</l>
       <l n="54">If they had but witnessed to-morrow 's bright sun .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="10">
       <l n="55">Oh , if the dead grieve , it is not for their fate ,</l>
       <l n="56">For death comes to all of us early or late ,</l>
       <l n="57">But their sighs of regret and their burdens of sorrow</l>
       <l n="58">Are born of the joys they 'd have scattered to-morrow .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="11">
       <l n="59">Do the friends they 'd have cheered know the thoughts of the dead ?</l>

       <l n="61">What mem'ries would sweeten , what hearts cease to burn ,</l>
       <l n="62">If but for a day the dead friends could return !</l>

       <l n="2">He was battle-scarred and ugly with the marks of shot and shell ,</l>
       <l n="3">And we knew that British Tommy had a stirring tale to tell ,</l>
       <l n="4">So we asked him where he got it and what disarranged his face ,</l>
       <l n="5">And he answered , blushing scarlet : “ In a nawsty little place . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="6">There were medals on his jacket , but he would n't tell us why .</l>
       <l n="7">“ A bit lucky , gettin ’ this one , ” was the sum of his reply .</l>
       <l n="8">He had fought a horde of Prussians with his back against the wall ,</l>
       <l n="9">And he told us , when we questioned : “ H'it was nothing arfter h'all . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="10">Not a word of what he 'd suffered , not a word of what he 'd seen ,</l>
       <l n="11">Not a word about the fury of the hell through which he 'd been .</l>
       <l n="12">All he said was : “ When you 're cornered , h'and you 've got no plyce to go ,</l>
       <l n="13">You 've just got to stand up to it ! You caw n't ‘ elp yourself , you know .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="18">When this sturdy British Tommy quits the battlefields of earth</l>
       <l n="19">And St. Peter asks his spirit to recount his deeds of worth ,</l>
       <l n="20">I fancy I can hear him , with his curious English drawl ,</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="23">With time our notions allus change ,</l>
       <l n="24">An ’ years make old idees seem strange —</l>
       <l n="25">Take Mary there — time was when she</l>
       <l n="26">Thought one child made a family ,</l>
       <l n="27">An ’ when our eldest , Jim , was born</l>
       <l n="28">She used to say , both night an ’ morn ':</l>
       <l n="29">“ One little one to love an ’ keep ,</l>
       <l n="30">To guard awake , an ’ watch asleep ;</l>
       <l n="31">To bring up right an ’ lead him through</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="9">
       <l n="33">Two years from then our Jennie came ,</l>
       <l n="34">But Mary did n't talk the same ;</l>
       <l n="35">“ Now that 's just right , ” she said to me ,</l>
       <l n="36">“ We 've got the proper family —</l>
       <l n="37">A boy an ’ girl , God sure is good ;</l>
       <l n="38">It seems as though He understood</l>
       <l n="39">That I 've been hopin ’ every way</l>

       <l n="41">Sometimes I 've prayed the whole night through —</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="10">
       <l n="43">Then as the months went rollin ’ on ,</l>

       <l n="47">Two boys , a girl to romp an ’ play —</l>
       <l n="48">Jus ’ work enough to fill the day .</l>
       <l n="49">I never had enough to do ,</l>

       <l n="55">An ’ Mary 's plumb forgot the day</l>
       <l n="56">She used to sit an ’ sweetly say</l>
       <l n="57">That one child was enough for her</l>
       <l n="58">To love an ’ give the proper care ;</l>
       <l n="59">One , two or three or four or five —</l>
       <l n="60">Why , goodness gracious , sakes alive ,</l>
       <l n="61">If God should send her ten to-night ,</l>

       <l n="64">He could n't use his driver any better on the tee</l>
       <l n="65">Than the chap that he was licking , who just happened to be me ;</l>
       <l n="66">I could hit them with a brassie just as straight and just as far ,</l>
       <l n="67">But I piled up several sevens while he made a few in par ;</l>
       <l n="68">And he trimmed me to a finish , and I know the reason why :</l>
       <l n="69">He could keep his temper better when he dubbed a shot than I .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="14">
       <l n="70">His mashie stroke is choppy , without any follow through ;</l>
       <l n="71">I doubt if he will ever , on a short hole , cop a two ,</l>
       <l n="72">But his putts are straight and deadly , and he does n't even frown</l>
       <l n="73">When he 's tried to hole a long one and just fails to get it down .</l>
       <l n="74">On the fourteenth green I faded ; there he put me on the shelf ,</l>
       <l n="75">And it 's not to his discredit when I say I licked myself .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="15">
       <l n="76">He never whined or whimpered when a shot of his went wrong ;</l>
       <l n="77">Never kicked about his troubles , but just plodded right along .</l>
       <l n="78">When he flubbed an easy iron , though I knew that he was vexed ,</l>
       <l n="79">He merely shrugged his shoulders , and then coolly played the next ,</l>
       <l n="80">While I flew into a frenzy over every dub I made</l>
       <l n="81">And was loud in my complaining at the dismal game I played .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="16">
       <l n="82">Golf is like the game of living ; it will show up what you are ;</l>
       <l n="83">If you take your troubles badly you will never play to par .</l>
       <l n="84">You may be a fine performer when your skies are bright and blue</l>
       <l n="85">But disaster is the acid that shall prove the worth of you ;</l>
       <l n="86">So just meet your disappointments with a cheery sort of grin ,</l>
       <l n="87">For the man who keeps his temper is the man that 's sure to win .</l>

       <l n="7">Then a sound-proof room the children have to hunt ;</l>
       <l n="8">For we have a sad few minutes in our very pleasant flat</l>

       <l n="12">When his collar-button underneath the chiffonier has rolled</l>
       <l n="13">A snatch of merry ragtime he will sing .</l>

       <l n="23">In the summer time it is his nightly stunt ;</l>
       <l n="24">And he says a lot of language that no gentleman should know</l>
       <l n="25">When the water in it splashes down his front .</l>
