      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="2">I NEVER saw that land before ,</l>
       <l n="3">And now can never see it again ;</l>
       <l n="4">Yet , as if by acquaintance hoar</l>
       <l n="5">Endeared , by gladness and by pain ,</l>
       <l n="6">Great was the affection that I bore</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="7">To the valley and the river small ,</l>
       <l n="8">The cattle , the grass , the bare ash trees ,</l>
       <l n="9">The chickens from the farmsteads , all</l>
       <l n="10">Elm-hidden , and the tributaries</l>
       <l n="11">Descending at equal interval ;</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="12">The blackthorns down along the brook</l>
       <l n="13">With wounds yellow as crocuses</l>
       <l n="14">Where yesterday the labourer 's hook</l>
       <l n="15">Had sliced them cleanly ; and the breeze</l>
       <l n="16">That hinted all and nothing spoke .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="17">I neither expected anything</l>
       <l n="18">Nor yet remembered : but some goal</l>
       <l n="19">I touched then ; and if I could sing</l>
       <l n="20">What would not even whisper my soul</l>
       <l n="21">As I went on my journeying ,</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="22">I should use , as the trees and birds did ,</l>
       <l n="23">A language not to be betrayed ;</l>
       <l n="24">And what was hid should still be hid</l>
       <l n="25">Excepting from those like me made</l>
       <l n="26">Who answer when such whispers bid .</l>

       <l n="1">DARK is the forest and deep , and overhead</l>
       <l n="2">Hang stars like seeds of light</l>
       <l n="3">In vain , though not since they were sown was bred</l>

      <head>CELANDINE</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">THINKING of her had saddened me at first ,</l>
       <l n="2">Until I saw the sun on the celandines lie</l>
       <l n="3">Redoubled , and she stood up like a flame ,</l>
       <l n="4">A living thing , not what before I nursed ,</l>
       <l n="5">The shadow I was growing to love almost ,</l>
       <l n="6">The phantom , not the creature with bright eye</l>
       <l n="7">That I had thought never to see , once lost .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="8">She found the celandines of February</l>
       <l n="9">Always before us all . Her nature and name</l>
       <l n="10">Were like those flowers , and now immediately</l>
       <l n="11">For a short swift eternity back she came ,</l>
       <l n="12">Beautiful , happy , simply as when she wore</l>
       <l n="13">Her brightest bloom among the winter hues</l>
       <l n="14">Of all the world ; and I was happy too ,</l>
       <l n="15">Seeing the blossoms and the maiden who</l>
       <l n="16">Had seen them with me Februarys before ,</l>
       <l n="17">Bending to them as in and out she trod</l>
       <l n="18">And laughed , with locks sweeping the mossy sod .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="19">But this was a dream : the flowers were not true ,</l>
       <l n="20">Until I stooped to pluck from the grass there</l>
       <l n="21">One of five petals and I smelt the juice</l>
       <l n="22">Which made me sigh , remembering she was no more ,</l>
       <l n="23">Gone like a never perfectly recalled air .</l>

      <head>THE ASH GROVE</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">HALF of the grove stood dead , and those that yet</l>
       <l n="2">lived made</l>
       <l n="3">Little more than the dead ones made of shade .</l>
       <l n="4">If they led to a house , long before they had seen</l>
       <l n="5">its fall :</l>
       <l n="6">But they welcomed me ; I was glad without cause</l>
       <l n="7">and delayed .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="8">Scarce a hundred paces under the trees was the</l>
       <l n="9">Interval —</l>
       <l n="10">Paces each sweeter than sweetest miles — but</l>
       <l n="11">nothing at all ,</l>
       <l n="12">Not even the spirits of memory and fear with</l>
       <l n="13">restless wing ,</l>
       <l n="14">Could climb down in to molest me over the wall</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="15">That I passed through at either end without</l>
       <l n="16">noticing .</l>
       <l n="17">And now an ash grove far from those hills can bring</l>
       <l n="18">The same tranquillity in which I wander a ghost</l>
       <l n="19">With a ghostly gladness , as if I heard a girl sing</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="20">The song of the Ash Grove soft as love uncrossed ,</l>
       <l n="21">And then in a crowd or in distance it were lost ,</l>
       <l n="22">But the moment unveiled something unwilling</l>
       <l n="23">to die</l>
       <l n="24">And I had what most I desired , without search or</l>
       <l n="25">desert or cost .</l>

      <head>OLD MAN</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">OLD Man , or Lad'shYpppHeNlove ,— in the name there 's</l>
       <l n="2">nothing</l>
       <l n="3">To one that knows not Lad'shYpppHeNlove , or Old Man ,</l>
       <l n="4">The hoar-green feathery herb , almost a tree ,</l>
       <l n="5">Growing with rosemary and lavender .</l>
       <l n="6">Even to one that knows it well , the names</l>
       <l n="7">Half decorate , half perplex , the thing it is :</l>
       <l n="8">At least , what that is clings not to the names</l>
       <l n="9">In spite of time . And yet I like the names .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="10">The herb itself I like not , but for certain</l>
       <l n="11">I love it , as some day the child will love it</l>
       <l n="12">Who plucks a feather from the door-side bush</l>
       <l n="13">Whenever she goes in or out of the house .</l>
       <l n="14">Often she waits there , snipping the tips and</l>
       <l n="15">shrivelling</l>
       <l n="16">The shreds at last on to the path , perhaps</l>
       <l n="17">Thinking , perhaps of nothing , till she sniffs</l>
       <l n="18">Her fingers and runs off . The bush is still</l>
       <l n="19">But half as tall as she , though it is as old ;</l>
       <l n="20">So well she clips it . Not a word she says ;</l>
       <l n="21">And I can only wonder how much hereafter</l>
       <l n="22">She will remember , with that bitter scent ,</l>
       <l n="23">Of garden rows , and ancient damson-trees</l>
       <l n="24">Topping a hedge , a bent path to a door ,</l>
       <l n="25">A low thick bush beside the door , and me</l>
       <l n="26">Forbidding her to pick .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="27">As for myself ,</l>
       <l n="28">Where first I met the bitter scent is lost .</l>
       <l n="29">I , too , often shrivel the grey shreds ,</l>
       <l n="30">Sniff them and think and sniff again and try</l>
       <l n="31">Once more to think what it is I am remembering ,</l>
       <l n="32">Always in vain . I cannot like the scent ,</l>
       <l n="33">Yet I would rather give up others more sweet ,</l>
       <l n="34">With no meaning , than this bitter one .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="35">I have mislaid the key . I sniff the spray</l>
       <l n="36">And think of nothing ; I see and I hear nothing ;</l>
       <l n="37">Yet seem , too , to be listening , lying in wait</l>
       <l n="38">For what I should , yet never can , remember :</l>
       <l n="39">No garden appears , no path , no hoar-green bush</l>
       <l n="40">Of Lad'shYpppHeNlove , or Old Man , no child beside ,</l>
       <l n="41">Neither father nor mother , nor any playmate ;</l>
       <l n="42">Only an avenue , dark , nameless , without end .</l>

       <l n="1">THEY met inside the gateway that gives the view ,</l>

       <l n="73">And I obeyed it and forgot the mist .</l>

     <head>THAT GIRL 'S CLEAR EYES</head>
     <p>THAT girl 's clear eyes utterly concealed all Except that there was something to reveal . And what did mine say in the interval ? No more : no less . They are but as a seal Not to be broken till after I am dead ; And then vainly . Every one of us This morning at our tasks left nothing said , In spite of many words . We were sealed thus , Like tombs . Nor until now could I admit That all I cared for was the pleasure and pain I tasted in the stony square sunlit , Or the dark cloisters , or shade of airy plane , While music blazed and children , line after line , Marched past , hiding the “ SEVENTEEN THIRTY - NINE . ”</p>

      <head>AMBITION</head>
       <l n="1">UNLESS it was that day I never knew</l>
       <l n="2">Ambition . After a night of frost , before</l>
       <l n="3">The March sun brightened and the South-west blew ,</l>
       <l n="4">Jackdaws began to shout and float and soar</l>

       <l n="13">Than was Elysium in that happy hour ,</l>
       <l n="14">A train that roared along raised after it</l>
       <l n="15">And carried with it a motionless white bower</l>
       <l n="16">Of purest cloud , from end to end close-knit ,</l>
       <l n="17">So fair it touched the roar with silence . Time</l>
       <l n="18">Was powerless while that lasted . I could sit</l>
       <l n="19">And think I had made the loveliness of prime ,</l>
       <l n="20">Breathed its life into it and were its lord ,</l>
       <l n="21">And no mind lived save this ‘ twixt clouds and rime .</l>
       <l n="22">Omnipotent I was , nor even deplored</l>
       <l n="23">That I did nothing . But the end fell like a bell :</l>
       <l n="24">The bower was scattered ; far off the train roared .</l>

      <head>THE CHALK-PIT</head>
       <l n="1">“ Is this the road that climbs above and bends</l>
       <l n="2">Round what was once a chalk-pit : now it is</l>
       <l n="3">By accident an amphitheatre .</l>
       <l n="4">Some ash-trees standing ankle-deep in brier</l>
       <l n="5">And bramble act the parts , and neither speak</l>
       <l n="6">Nor stir . ” “ But see : they have fallen , every one ,</l>
       <l n="7">And brier and bramble have grown over them . ”</l>
       <l n="8">“ That is the place . As usual no one is here .</l>
       <l n="9">Hardly can I imagine the drop of the axe ,</l>
       <l n="10">And the smack that is like an echo , sounding here . ”</l>
       <l n="11">“ I do not understand . ” “ Why , what I mean is</l>
       <l n="12">That I have seen the place two or three times</l>
       <l n="13">At most , and that its emptiness and silence</l>
       <l n="14">And stillness haunt me , as if just before</l>
       <l n="15">It was not empty , silent , still , but full</l>
       <l n="16">Of life of some kind , perhaps tragical .</l>
       <l n="17">Has anything unusual happened here ? ”</l>
       <l n="18">“ Not that I know of . It is called the Dell .</l>
       <l n="19">They have not dug chalk here for a century .</l>

       <l n="24">For so it looks now . In my memory</l>
       <l n="25">Again and again I see it , strangely dark ,</l>
       <l n="26">And vacant of a life but just withdrawn .</l>
       <l n="27">We have not seen the woodman with the axe .</l>
       <l n="28">Some ghost has left it now as we two came . ”</l>

       <l n="34">Or I myself a long way back in time . . . ”</l>
       <l n="35">“ Why , as to that , I used to meet a man —</l>
       <l n="36">I had forgotten ,— searching for birds ’ nests</l>
       <l n="37">Along the road and in the chalk-pit too .</l>
       <l n="38">The wren 's hole was an eye that looked at him</l>
       <l n="39">For recognition . Every nest he knew .</l>
       <l n="40">He got a stiff neck , by looking this side or that ,</l>
       <l n="41">Spring after spring , he told me , with his laugh ,—</l>
       <l n="42">A sort of laugh . He was a visitor ,</l>
       <l n="43">A man of forty ,— smoked and strolled about .</l>
       <l n="44">At orts and crosses Pleasure and Pain had played</l>
       <l n="45">On his brown features ;— I think both had lost ;—</l>
       <l n="46">Mild and yet wild too . You may know the kind .</l>
       <l n="47">And once or twice a woman shared his walks ,</l>
       <l n="48">A girl of twenty with a brown boy 's face ,</l>
       <l n="49">And hair brown as a thrush or as a nut ,</l>
       <l n="50">Thick eyebrows , glinting eyes — ” “ You have</l>
       <l n="51">said enough .</l>
       <l n="52">A pair ,— free thought , free love ,— I know the</l>
       <l n="53">breed :</l>
       <l n="54">I shall not mix my fancies up with them . ”</l>
       <l n="55">“ You please yourself . I should prefer the truth</l>
       <l n="56">Or nothing . Here , in fact , is nothing at all</l>
       <l n="57">Except a silent place that once rang loud ,</l>
       <l n="58">And trees and us — imperfect friends , we men</l>
       <l n="59">And trees since time began ; and nevertheless</l>

       <l n="9">He took the heat of the sun , and from below .</l>

       <l n="34">Not even the kneeling ox had eyes like the Romany .</l>
       <l n="35">That night he peopled for me the hollow wooded</l>
       <l n="36">land ,</l>
       <l n="37">More dark and wild than stormiest heavens , that I</l>
       <l n="38">searched and scanned</l>
       <l n="39">Like a ghost new-arrived . The gradations of the</l>

       <l n="41">Were like an underworld of death , but for the spark</l>
       <l n="42">In the Gypsy boy 's black eyes as he played and</l>
       <l n="43">stamped his tune ,</l>
       <l n="44">“ Over the hills and far away , ” and a crescent moon .</l>

       <l n="1">“ ‘ TWILL take some getting . ” “ Sir , I think ‘ twill</l>
       <l n="2">so . ”</l>
       <l n="3">The old man stared up at the mistletoe</l>
       <l n="4">That hung too high in the poplar 's crest for plunder</l>
       <l n="5">Of any climber , though not for kissing under :</l>
       <l n="6">Then he went on against the north-east wind —</l>
       <l n="7">Straight but lame , leaning on a staff new-skinned ,</l>
       <l n="8">Carrying a brolly , flag-basket , and old coat ,—</l>
       <l n="9">Towards Alton , ten miles off . And he had not</l>
       <l n="10">Done less from Chilgrove where he pulled up docks .</l>
       <l n="11">‘ Twere best , if he had had “ a money-box , ”</l>
       <l n="12">To have waited there till the sheep cleared a field</l>
       <l n="13">For what a half-week 's flint-picking would yield .</l>
       <l n="14">His mind was running on the work he had done</l>
       <l n="15">Since he left Christchurch in the New Forest , one</l>
       <l n="16">Spring in the ‘ seventies ,— navvying on dock and</l>
       <l n="17">line</l>
       <l n="18">From Southampton to Newcastle-on-Tyne ,—</l>
       <l n="19">In ‘ seventy-four a year of soldiering</l>
       <l n="20">With the Berkshires ,— hoeing and harvesting</l>
       <l n="21">In half the shires where corn and couch will grow .</l>
       <l n="22">His sons , three sons , were fighting , but the hoe</l>
       <l n="23">And reap-hook he liked , or anything to do with</l>
       <l n="24">trees .</l>
       <l n="25">He fell once from a poplar tall as these :</l>
       <l n="26">The Flying Man they called him in hospital .</l>
       <l n="27">“ If I flew now , to another world I 'd fall . ”</l>
       <l n="28">He laughed and whistled to the small brown bitch</l>
       <l n="29">With spots of blue that hunted in the ditch .</l>
       <l n="30">Her foxy Welsh grandfather must have paired</l>
       <l n="31">Beneath him . He kept sheep in Wales and scared</l>
       <l n="32">Strangers , I will warrant , with his pearl eye</l>
       <l n="33">And trick of shrinking off as he were shy ,</l>
       <l n="34">Then following close in silence for — for what ?</l>
       <l n="35">“ No rabbit , never fear , she ever got ,</l>
       <l n="36">Yet always hunts . To-day she nearly had one :</l>
       <l n="37">She would and she would n't . ‘ Twas like that . The</l>
       <l n="38">bad one !</l>
       <l n="39">She 's not much use , but still she 's company ,</l>
       <l n="40">Though I 'm not . She goes everywhere with me .</l>
       <l n="41">So Alton I must reach to-night somehow :</l>
       <l n="42">I 'll get no shakedown with that bedfellow</l>
       <l n="43">From farmers . Many a man sleeps worse to-night</l>
       <l n="44">Than I shall . ” “ In the trenches . ” “ Yes , that 's</l>
       <l n="45">right .</l>
       <l n="46">But they 'll be out of that — I hope they be —</l>
       <l n="47">This weather , marching after the enemy . ”</l>
       <l n="48">“ And so I hope . Good luck . ” And there I nodded</l>
       <l n="49">“ Good-night . You keep straight on . ” Stiffly he</l>
       <l n="50">plodded ;</l>
       <l n="51">And at his heels the crisp leaves scurried fast ,</l>
       <l n="52">And the leaf-coloured robin watched . They</l>
       <l n="53">passed ,</l>
       <l n="54">The robin till next day , the man for good ,</l>
       <l n="55">Together in the twilight of the wood .</l>
