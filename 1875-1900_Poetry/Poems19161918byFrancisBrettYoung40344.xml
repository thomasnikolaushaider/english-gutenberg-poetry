       <l n="2">When the evening came my love said to me :</l>
       <l n="3">Let us go into the garden now that the sky is cool ,</l>
       <l n="4">The garden of black hellebore and rosemary ,</l>
       <l n="5">Where wild woodruff spills in a milky pool .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="6">Low we passed in the twilight , for the wavering heat</l>
       <l n="7">Of day had waned , and round that shaded plot</l>
       <l n="8">Of secret beauty the thickets clustered sweet :</l>
       <l n="9">Here is heaven , our hearts whispered , but our lips spake not .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="10">Between that old garden and seas of lazy foam</l>
       <l n="11">Gloomy and beautiful alleys of trees arise</l>
       <l n="12">With spire of cypress and dreamy beechen dome ,</l>
       <l n="13">So dark that our enchanted sight knew nothing but the skies</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="14">Veiled with soft air , drench 'd in the roses ’ musk</l>
       <l n="15">Or the dusky , dark carnation 's breath of clove ;</l>
       <l n="16">No stars burned in their deeps , but through the dusk</l>
       <l n="17">I saw my love 's eyes , and they were brimmed with love .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="18">No star their secret ravished , no wasting moon</l>
       <l n="19">Mocked the sad transience of those eternal hours :</l>
       <l n="20">Only the soft , unseeing heaven of June ,</l>
       <l n="21">The ghosts of great trees , and the sleeping flowers .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="22">For doves that crooned in the leafy noonday now</l>
       <l n="23">Were silent ; the night-jar sought his secret covers ,</l>
       <l n="24">Nor even a mild sea-whisper moved a creaking bough —</l>
       <l n="25">Was ever a silence deeper made for lovers ?</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="26">Was ever a moment meeter made for love ?</l>
       <l n="27">Beautiful are your closed lips beneath my kiss ;</l>
       <l n="28">And all your yielding sweetness beautiful —</l>
       <l n="29">Oh , never in all the world was such a night as this !</l>

       <l n="1">If I had died , and never seen the dawn</l>
       <l n="2">For which I hardly hoped , lighting this lawn</l>
       <l n="3">Of silvery grasses ; if there had been no light ,</l>
       <l n="4">And last night merged into perpetual night ;</l>
       <l n="5">I doubt if I should ever have been content</l>
       <l n="6">To have closed my eyes without some testament</l>
       <l n="7">To the great benefits that marked my faring</l>
       <l n="8">Through the sweet world ; for all my joy was sharing</l>
       <l n="9">And lonely pleasures were few . Unto which end</l>
       <l n="10">Three legacies I 'll send ,</l>
       <l n="11">Three legacies , already half possess 'd :</l>
       <l n="12">One to a friend , of all good friends the best ,</l>
       <l n="13">Better than which is nothing ; yet another</l>
       <l n="14">Unto thy twin , dissimilar spirit , Brother ;</l>
       <l n="15">The third to you ,</l>
       <l n="16">Most beautiful , most true ,</l>
       <l n="17">Most perfect one , to whom they all are due .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="18">Quick , quick ... while there is time ....</l>
       <l n="19">O best of friends , I leave you one sublime</l>
       <l n="20">Summer , one fadeless summer . ‘ Twas begun</l>
       <l n="21">Ere Cotswold hawthorn tarnished in the sun ,</l>
       <l n="22">When hedges were fledged with green , and early swallows</l>
       <l n="23">Swift-darting , on curved wings , pillaged the fallows ;</l>
       <l n="24">When all our vale was dappled blossom and light ,</l>
       <l n="25">And oh , the scent of beanfields in the night !</l>
       <l n="26">You shall remember that rich dust at even</l>
       <l n="27">Which made old Evesham like a street in heaven ,</l>
       <l n="28">Gold-paved , and washed within a wave of golden</l>
       <l n="29">Air all her dreamy towers and gables olden .</l>
       <l n="30">You shall remember</l>
       <l n="31">How arms sun-blistered , hot palms crack 'd with rowing ,</l>
       <l n="32">Clove the cool water of Avon , sweetly flowing ;</l>
       <l n="33">And how our bodies , beautifully white ,</l>
       <l n="34">Stretch 'd to a long stroke lengthened in green light ,</l>
       <l n="35">And we , emerging , laughed in childish wise ,</l>
       <l n="36">And pressed the kissing water from our eyes .</l>
       <l n="37">Ah , was our laughter childish , or were we wise ?</l>
       <l n="38">And then , crown of the day , a tired returning</l>
       <l n="39">With happy sunsets over Bredon burning ,</l>
       <l n="40">With music and with moonlight , and good ale ,</l>
       <l n="41">And no thought for the morrow .... Heavy phlox</l>
       <l n="42">Our garden pathways bordered , and evening stocks ,</l>
       <l n="43">Those humble weeds , in sunlight withered and pale ,</l>
       <l n="44">With a night scent to match the nightingale ,</l>
       <l n="45">Gladdened with spiced sweetness sweet night 's shadows ,</l>
       <l n="46">Meeting the breath of hay from mowing meadows :</l>
       <l n="47">As humble was our joy , and as intense</l>
       <l n="48">Our rapture . So , before I hurry hence ,</l>
       <l n="49">Yours be the memory .</l>
       <l n="50">One night again ,</l>
       <l n="51">When we were men , and had striven , and known pain ,</l>
       <l n="52">By a dark canal debating , unresigned ,</l>
       <l n="53">On the blind fate that shadows humankind ,</l>
       <l n="54">On the blind sword that severs human love ...</l>
       <l n="55">Then did the hidden belfry from above</l>
       <l n="56">On troubled minds in benediction shed</l>
       <l n="57">The patience of the great anonymous dead</l>
       <l n="58">Who reared those towers , those high cathedrals builded</l>
       <l n="59">In solemn stone , and with clear fancy gilded</l>
       <l n="60">A beauty beyond ours , trusting in God .</l>
       <l n="61">Then dared we follow the dark way they trod ,</l>
       <l n="62">And bowing to the universal plan</l>
       <l n="63">Trust in the true and fiery spirit of Man .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="64">And you , my Brother ,</l>
       <l n="65">You know , as knows one other ,</l>
       <l n="66">How my spirit revisiteth a room</l>
       <l n="67">In a high wing , beneath pine-trees , where gloom</l>
       <l n="68">Dwelleth , dispelled by resinous wood embers ,</l>
       <l n="69">Where , in half-darkness ... How the heart remembers ...</l>
       <l n="70">We talked of beauty , and those fiery things</l>
       <l n="71">To which the divine desirous spirit clings ,</l>
       <l n="72">In a wing 'd rapture to that heaven flinging ,</l>
       <l n="73">Where beauty is an easy thing , and singing</l>
       <l n="74">The natural speech of man . Like kissing swords</l>
       <l n="75">Our wits clashed there ; the brittle beauty of words</l>
       <l n="76">Breaking , seemed to discover its secret heart</l>
       <l n="77">And all the rapt elusiveness of Art .</l>
       <l n="78">Now I have known sorrow , and now I sing</l>
       <l n="79">That a lovely word is not an idle thing ;</l>
       <l n="80">For as with stars the cloth of night is spangled ,</l>
       <l n="81">With star-like words , most lovelily entangled ,</l>
       <l n="82">The woof of sombre thought is deckt .... Ah , bright</l>
       <l n="83">And cold they glitter in the spirit 's night !</l>
       <l n="84">But neither distant nor dispassionate ;</l>
       <l n="85">For beauty is an armour against fate ....</l>
       <l n="86">I tell you , who have stood in the dark alone .</l>
       <l n="87">Seeing the face that turneth all to stone ,</l>
       <l n="88">Medusa , blind with hate ,</l>
       <l n="89">While I was dying , Beauty sate with me</l>
       <l n="90">Nor tortured any longer ; gracious was she ;</l>
       <l n="91">To her soft words I listened , and was content</l>
       <l n="92">To die , nor sorry that my light was spent .</l>
       <l n="93">So , Brother , if I come not home ,</l>
       <l n="94">Go to that little room</l>
       <l n="95">That my spirit revisiteth , and there ,</l>
       <l n="96">Somewhere in the blue air , you shall discover</l>
       <l n="97">If that you be a lover</l>
       <l n="98">Nor haughtily minded , all that once half-shaped</l>
       <l n="99">Then fled us , and escaped :</l>
       <l n="100">All that I found that day ,</l>
       <l n="101">Far , so far away .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="102">And you , my lovely one ,</l>
       <l n="103">What can I leave to you , who , you having left ,</l>
       <l n="104">Am utterly bereft ?</l>
       <l n="105">What in my store of visionary dowers</l>
       <l n="106">Is not already yours ?</l>
       <l n="107">What silences , what hours</l>
       <l n="108">Of peace passing all understanding ; days</l>
       <l n="109">Made lyric by your beauty and its praise ;</l>
       <l n="110">Years neither time can tarnish , nor death mar ,</l>
       <l n="111">Wherein you shined as steadfast as a star</l>
       <l n="112">In my bleak night , heedless of the cloud-wrack</l>
       <l n="113">Scudding in torn fleeces black</l>
       <l n="114">Of my dark moods , as those who rule the far</l>
       <l n="115">Star-haunted pleasaunces of heaven are ?</l>
       <l n="116">So think but lightly of that afternoon</l>
       <l n="117">With white clouds climbing a blue sky in June</l>
       <l n="118">When a boy worshipped under dreaming trees ,</l>
       <l n="119">Who touched your hand , and sought your eyes .</l>
       <l n="120">... Ah , cease ,</l>
       <l n="121">Not these , not these ...</l>
       <l n="122">Nor yet those nights when icy Brathay thundered</l>
       <l n="123">Under his bridges , and ghostly mountains wondered</l>
       <l n="124">At the white blossoming of a Christmas rose</l>
       <l n="125">More stainless than their snows ;</l>
       <l n="126">Nor even of those placid days together</l>
       <l n="127">Mellow as early autumn 's amber weather</l>
       <l n="128">When beech is ankleted with fire , and old</l>
       <l n="129">Elms wear their livery of yellow gold ,</l>
       <l n="130">When orchards all are laden with increase ,</l>
       <l n="131">And the quiet earth hath fruited , and knows peace</l>
       <l n="132">Oh , think not overmuch on those sweet years</l>
       <l n="133">Lest their last fruit be tears ,—</l>
       <l n="134">Your tears , beloved , that were my utmost pain ,—</l>
       <l n="135">But rather , dream again</l>
       <l n="136">How that a lover , half poet and half child ,</l>
       <l n="137">An eager spirit of fragile fancies wild</l>
       <l n="138">Compact , adored the beauty and truth in you :</l>
       <l n="139">To your own truth be true ;</l>
       <l n="140">And when , not mournfully , you turn this page</l>
       <l n="141">Consider still your starry heritage ,</l>
       <l n="142">Continue in your loveliness , a star</l>
       <l n="143">To gladden me from afar</l>
       <l n="144">Even where there is no light</l>
       <l n="145">In my last night .</l>

       <l n="1">This is the image of my last content :</l>
       <l n="2">My soul shall be a little lonely lake ,</l>
       <l n="3">So hidden that no shadow of man may break</l>
       <l n="4">The folding of its mountain battlement ;</l>
       <l n="5">Only the beautiful and innocent</l>
       <l n="6">Whiteness of sea-born cloud drooping to shake</l>
       <l n="7">Cool rain upon the reed-beds , or the wake</l>
       <l n="8">Of churn 'd cloud in a howling wind 's descent .</l>

       <l n="10">When stars that I have loved are born in me ,</l>
       <l n="11">And cloudy darkness I will hold most fair ;</l>

       <l n="1">These winter days on Lettermore</l>
       <l n="2">The brown west wind it sweeps the bay ,</l>
       <l n="3">And icy rain beats on the bare</l>
       <l n="4">Unhomely fields that perish there :</l>

       <l n="10">To light dark fires within their brains</l>
       <l n="11">And fight with stones on Lettermore</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="13">When spring blows over Lettermore</l>

       <l n="16">Is laden with the smell of death :</l>
       <l n="17">For fever breeds on Lettermore</l>
       <l n="18">To waste the eyes of young and old .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="19">A black van comes to Lettermore ;</l>

       <l n="22">To cross the hills from Oughterard</l>
       <l n="23">And cart the sick from Lettermore :</l>

      <head>ODE WRITTEN AT WILTON HOUSE</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">Last night , amazed , I trod on holy ground</l>

       <l n="4">Beneath a garden 's alley 'd shades of yew ,</l>
       <l n="5">With eager feet passed that singer sweet</l>
       <l n="6">Who Stella loved , whom bloody Zutphen slew</l>
       <l n="7">In the starred zenith of his knightly fame .</l>
       <l n="8">There too a dark-stoled figure I did meet :</l>
       <l n="9">Herbert , whose faith burned true</l>
       <l n="10">And steadfast as the altar candle 's flame .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="11">Under the Wilton cedars , pondering</l>
       <l n="12">Upon the pains of Beauty and the wrong</l>
       <l n="13">That sealeth lovely lips , fated to sing ,</l>
       <l n="14">Before they reach the cadence of their song ,</l>
       <l n="15">I mused upon dead poets : mighty ones</l>
       <l n="16">Who sang and suffered : briefly heard were they</l>
       <l n="17">As Libyan nightingales weary of wing</l>
       <l n="18">Fleeing the temper of Saharan suns</l>
       <l n="19">To gladden our moon 'd May ,</l>

       <l n="23">His cheeks and eyes burned with a hectic flame ;</l>
       <l n="24">And one , alas ! I saw whose passionate might</l>
       <l n="25">Was spent upon a fevered fen in Greece ;</l>
       <l n="26">One shade there was who , starving , choked with bread ;</l>
       <l n="27">One , a drown 'd corpse , through stormy water slips ;</l>
       <l n="28">One in the numbing poppy-juice found peace ;</l>
       <l n="29">And one , a youth , lay dead</l>

       <l n="31">O bitter were the sorrow that could dull</l>
       <l n="32">The sombre music of slow evening</l>
       <l n="33">Here , where the old world is so beautiful</l>
       <l n="34">That even lesser lips are moved to sing</l>
       <l n="35">How the wide heron sails into the light</l>
       <l n="36">Black as the cedarn shadows on the lawns</l>
       <l n="37">Or stricken woodlands patient in decay ,</l>
       <l n="38">And river water murmurs through the night</l>
       <l n="39">Until autumnal dawns</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="41">Nay , these were they by whom the world was lost ,</l>
       <l n="42">To whom the world most richly gave : forlorn</l>
       <l n="43">Beauty they worshipp 'd , counting not the cost</l>
       <l n="44">If of their torment beauty might be born ;</l>
       <l n="45">And life , the splendid flower of their delight ,</l>
       <l n="46">Loving too eagerly , they broke , and spill 'd</l>
       <l n="47">The perfume that the folded petals close</l>
       <l n="48">Before its prime ; yet their frail fingers white</l>
       <l n="49">From that bruised bloom distill 'd</l>
       <l n="50">Uttermost attar of the living rose .</l>
      </lg>

       <l n="51">Wherefore , O shining ones , I will not mourn</l>
       <l n="52">You , who have ravish 'd beauty 's secret ways</l>
       <l n="53">Beneath death 's impotent shadow , suffering scorn ,</l>
       <l n="54">Hatred , and desolation in her praise ....</l>
       <l n="55">Thus as I spoke their phantom faces smiled ,</l>
       <l n="56">As brooding night with heavy downward wing</l>
       <l n="57">Fell upon Wilton 's elegiac stone ,</l>
       <l n="58">On the dark woodlands and the waters wild</l>
       <l n="59">And every living thing —</l>

       <l n="1">Into that dry and most desolate place</l>
       <l n="2">With heavy gait they dragged the stretcher in</l>
       <l n="3">And laid him on the bloody ground : the din</l>
       <l n="4">Of Maxim fire ceased not . I raised his head ,</l>
       <l n="5">And looked into his face ,</l>
       <l n="6">And saw that he was dead .</l>
       <l n="7">Saw beneath matted curls the broken skin</l>
       <l n="8">That let the bullet in ;</l>
       <l n="9">And saw the limp , lithe limbs , the smiling mouth ...</l>
       <l n="10">( Ah , may we smile at death</l>
       <l n="11">As bravely ....) the curv 'd lips that no more drouth</l>
       <l n="12">Should blacken , and no sweetly stirring breath</l>
       <l n="13">Mildly displace .</l>
       <l n="14">So I covered the calm face</l>
       <l n="15">And stripped the shirt from his firm breast , and there ,</l>
       <l n="16">A zinc identity disc , a bracelet of elephant hair</l>
       <l n="17">I found .... Ah , God , how deep it stings</l>
       <l n="18">This unendurable pity of small things !</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="19">But more than this I saw ,</l>

       <l n="21">And brutal havoc of war .</l>
       <l n="22">England I saw , the mother from whose side</l>
       <l n="23">He came hither and died , she at whose hems he had play 'd ,</l>
       <l n="24">In whose quiet womb his body and soul were made .</l>
       <l n="25">That pale , estranged flesh that we bowed over</l>
       <l n="26">Had breathed the scent in summer of white clover ;</l>
       <l n="27">Dreamed her cool fading nights , her twilights long ,</l>
       <l n="28">And days as careless as a blackbird 's song</l>
       <l n="29">Heard in the hush of eve , when midges ’ wings</l>

       <l n="35">Breath of that holy land</l>
       <l n="36">Whither my soul aspireth without despair :</l>
       <l n="37">In the broken brain had many a lovely word</l>

       <l n="39">Telling of love and laughter and low voices ,</l>
       <l n="40">And tales in which the English heart rejoices</l>
       <l n="41">In vanishing visions of childhood and its glories :</l>

       <l n="46">A prairie fire , with huge fantastic flame</l>
       <l n="47">Leapt , lighting dark clouds charged with thunder .</l>
       <l n="48">And my heart was sick with shame</l>

       <l n="54">A tired horse , lean , with outreaching head ,</l>

       <l n="58">Thou pale one , whom now men say bearest the scythe</l>
       <l n="59">Of God , that iron scythe forged by his thunder</l>
       <l n="60">For reaping of nations overripened , fashioned</l>
       <l n="61">Upon the clanging anvil whose sparks , flying</l>
       <l n="62">In a starry night , dying , fall hereunder ....</l>

       <l n="66">O thou , cried I , who choosest for thy going</l>
       <l n="67">These bloomy meadows of youth , these flowery ways</l>
       <l n="68">Whereby no influence strays</l>
       <l n="69">Ruder than a cold wind blowing ,</l>
       <l n="70">Or beating needles of rain ,</l>

       <l n="72">Ruthless among the pastures yet unripened ,</l>
       <l n="73">Crushing their beauty in thine iron track</l>
       <l n="74">Downtrodden , ravish 'd in thy following flame ,</l>
       <l n="75">Parched and black ?</l>
       <l n="76">But she , she stayed not in her weary haste</l>
       <l n="77">Nor turned her face ; but fled :</l>

      <docTitle><titlePart>THAMAR ( To Thamar Karsavina ) Once in the sombre light of the throng 'd courts of night , In a dream-haunted land only inhabited By the unhappy dead , came one who , anxious eyed , Clung to my idle hand with clenched fingers weak And gazed into my eyes as he had wrongs to speak . Silent he stood and wan , more pallid than the leaves Of an aspen blown under a wind that grieves . Then I : ‘ O haggard one , say from what ghostly zone Of thwarted destinies or torment hast thou come ? Tell me thy race and name ! ’ And he , with veiled face : ‘ I have neither name nor race , but I have travelled far , A timeless avatar of never-ending dooms , Out of those tyrannous glooms where , like a tired star In stormy darkness , looms the castle of Thamar ... Once in a lonely dawn my eager spirit fared By ways that no men dared unto a desert land , Where , on a sullen strand , a mouldering city , vast As towered Babylon , stood in the dreamy sand — Older a million years : Babel was builded on That broken city 's tears ; dust of her crumbled past Rose from the rapid wheels of Babel 's charioteers In whorled clouds above those shining thoroughfares Where Babel 's millions tread on her unheeding dead . Forth from an eastern gate where the lips of Asia wait Parch 'd with an ancient thirst that no aeons can abate , Passed I , predestinate , to a thorn 'd desert 's drought , Where the rivers of the south , flowing in a cloudy spate , Spend at last their splendid strength in a sea of molten glass Seething with the brazen might of a white sun dipped at length Like a baked stone , burning hot , plunged in a hissing pot . Out of that solemn portal over the tawny waste , Without stay , without haste , nor the joy of any mortal Glance of eye or clasp of hand , desolate , in a burning land , Lonely days and nights I travelled and the changing seasons squandered Friendless , endlessly , I wandered nor my woven fate unravelled ; Drawn to a hidden goal , sore , forlorn with waiting , Seeking I knew not what , yet unhesitating Struggled my hapless soul ... There , in a thousand springs , Slow , beneath frozen snow , where the blind earth lay cringing , Have I seen the steppe unfold uncounted blossomings , Where salty pools shone fair in a quivering blue air That shivered every fringing reed-bed with cool delight , And fanned the mazy flight of slow-wing 'd egrets white Beating and wheeling bright against the sun astare ; But I could not hear their wings for they were ghostly things Sent by the powers of night to mock my sufferings And rain upon the bitter waterpools their drops aglitter . Yet , when these lakes accursed tortured my aching thirst , The green reeds fell to dust , the cool pools to a crust Of frozen salt crystallised to taunt my broken lips , To cheat my staring eyes , as a vision of great ships With moving towers of sail , poops throng 'd with grinning crowds And a wind in their shrouds , bears down upon the pale Wasted castaway afloat with the salt in his throat And a feeble wild desire to be quenched of his fire In the green gloom beneath . So , again and again , Hath a phantom city thrust to the visionary vault Of inviolate cobalt , dome and dreaming minaret Mosque and gleaming water-tower hazy in a fountain 's jet Or a market 's rising dust ; and my lips have cried aloud To see them tremble there , though I knew within my heart They were chiselled out of cloud or carven of thin air ; And my fingers clenched my hand , for I wondered if this land Of my stony pilgrimage were a glimmering mirage , And I myself no more than a phantom of the sand . ‘ But beyond these fading slender cities , many leagues away , Strange brooding mountains lay heaped , crowding range on range In a changing cloudy splendour ; and beyond , in lakes of light , As eastward still I staggered , there swam into my sight , More vast and hoar and haggard , shoulders of ice and snow Bounding the heavens low of burnished brass , whereunder The hot plains of Cathay perpetually slumber : Where tawny millions breed in cities without number , Whither , a hill-born thunder , rolling on Tartary With torrents and barb 'd lightning , swelleth the yellow river To a tumult of whitening foam and confused might That drowns in a single night many a mud-made city ; And cities of boats , and frail cities of lath and reed , Are whirled away without pity or set afloat in a pale , Swirling , shallow sea ... and their names seem lost for ever Till a stranger nomad race drive their herds to the sad place Where old sorrows lie forgotten , and raise upon the rotten Level waste another brood to await another flood . ‘ But I never might attain to this melancholy plain For the mountains rose between ; stark in my path they lay Between me and Cathay , through moving mist half-seen . And I knew that they were real , for their drooping folds of cloud Enwrapped me in a shroud , and the air that fell at night From their frozen summits white slid like an ice-blue steel Into my living breast and stilled the heart within As the chill of an old sin that robs a man of rest , Killing all delight in the silence of the night And brooding black above till the heart dare not move But lieth cold and numb ... and the dawn will not come . ‘ Yet to me a dawn came , new-kindled in cold flame , Flinging the imminence of those inviolate snows On the forest lawns below in a shadow more immense Than their eternal vastness ; and a new hope beyond reason , Flamed in my heart 's dark season , dazzled my pallid eyes , Till , when the hot sun soared above the uttermost height , A draught of keen delight into my body was poured , For all that frozen fastness lay flowered with the spring : Her starry blossoms broke beneath my bruised feet , And their beauty was so sweet to me I kissed them where they lay ; Yea , I bent my weary hips and kissed them with dry lips , Tenderly , only dreading lest their petals delicate Should be broken by my treading , for I lived , I lived again , And my heart would have been broken by a living creature 's pain , So I kissed them for a token of my joy in their new birth , And I kissed the gentle earth . Slowly the shadows crept To the bases of the crags , and I slept .... ‘ Once , in another life , had I remembered sleep , When tired children creep on to their mother 's knees , And there a dreamless peace more quietly descendeth Than gentle evening endeth or ring-doves fold their wings , Before the nightjar spins or the nightingale begins ; When the brooding hedgerow trees where they nest lie awake And breathe so soft they shake not a single shuddering leaf Lest the silence should break . ‘ Other sleep have I known , Deeper , beyond belief , when straining limbs relax After hot human toil in yellow harvest fields Where the panting earth yields a smell of baked soil , And the dust of dry stubbles blows over the whitening Shocks of lank grain and bundles of flax , And men fling themselves down forgetting their troubles , Unheedful of the song that the landrail weaves along Misty woodlands , or lightning that the pale sky laves Like phosphorescent waves washing summer seas : And , more beautiful than these , that sleep of dazed wonder When love has torn asunder the veils of the sky And raptured lovers lie faint in each other 's arms Beneath a heaven strewn with myriad starry swarms , Where planets float like lonely gold-flowered nenuphars In pools of the sky ; yet , when they wake , they turn From those burning galaxies seeking heaven only In each other 's eyes , and sigh , and sleep again ; For while they sleep they seem to forget the world 's pain , And when they wake , they dream .... ‘ But other sleep was mine As I had drunk of wine with bitter hemlock steep 'd , Or soused with the heaped milky poppyheads A drowsy Tartar treads where slow waters sweep Over red river beds , and the air is heavy with sleep . So , when I woke at last , the labouring earth had rolled Eastward under the vast dominion of night , Funereal , forlorn as that unlighted chamber Wherein she first was born , bereft of all starlight , Pale silver of the moon , or the low sun 's amber . ‘ Then to my queen I prayed , grave Ashtoreth , whose shade Hallows the dim abyss of Heliopolis , Where many an olive maid clashed kissing Syrian cymbals , And silver-sounding timbrels shivered through the vale . O lovely , and O white , under the holy night Is their gleaming wonder , and their brows are pale As the new risen moon , dancing till they swoon In far forests under desolate Lebanon , While the flame of Moloch 's pyre reddens the sea-born cloud That overshadows Tyre ; so , when I cried aloud , Behold , a torch of fire leapt on the mountain-side ! ‘ O bright , O beautiful ! for never kindlier light Fell on the darkened sight of mortal eyes and dull Since that devoted one , whom gloomy Caucasus In icy silence lonely bound to his cruel shoulders , Brought to benighted men in a hollow fennel-stem Sparks of the torrid vapour that burned behind the bars Of evening , broke dawn 's rose , or smouldered in the stars , Or lit the glowworm 's taper , or wavered over the fen , Or tipped the javelin of the far-ravening levin , Lash of the Lord of Heaven and bitter scourge of sin . O beautiful , O bright ! my tired sinews strained To this torch that flared and waned as a watery planet gloweth And waneth in the night when a calm sea floweth Under a misty sky spread with the tattered veils Of rapid cloud driven over the deeps of heaven By winds that range too high to sweep the languid sails . On through the frozen night , like a blind moth flying With battered wing and bruised bloom into a light , I dragged my ragged limbs , cared not if I were dying , Knew not if I were dead , where cavernous crevasses , And stony desperate passes snared , waylaid my tread : In the roar of broken boulders split from rocky shoulders , In the thunder of snow sliding , or under the appalling Rending of glacier ice or hoarse cataracts falling : And I knew not what could save me but the unholy guiding That some demon gave me . Thrice I fell , and thrice In torrents of blue ice-water slipp 'd and was toss 'd Like a dead leaf , or a ghost Harried by thin bufferings of wind Downward to Tartarus at daybreak , Downward to the regions of the lost .... But the rushing waters ceased , and the bitter wind fell : How I cannot tell , unless that I had come To the hollow heart of the storm where the wind is dumb ; And there my gelid blood thawed , glowed , and grew warm , While a black-hooded form caught at my arm , and stayed And held me as I swayed , until , at last , I saw In a strange unworldly awe , at the gate of light I stood : And I entered , alone .... ‘ Behold a cavern of stone carven , and in the midst A brazier that hissed with tongued flames , leaping Over whitened embers of gummy frankincense , Into a fume of dense and fragrant vapour , creeping Over the roof to spread a milky coverlet Softer than the woof of webby spider 's net . But never spider yet spun a more delicate wonder Than that which hung thereunder , drooping fold on fold , Silks that glowed with fire of tawny Oxus gold , Richer than ever flowed from the eager fancy of man In his vain desire for beauty that endures : And on the floor were spread by many a heaped daiwan Carpets of Kurdistan , cured skins , and water-ewers Encrusted with such gems as emperors of Hind ( Swart conquerors , long dead ) sought for their diadems .</titlePart></docTitle>

       <l n="18">From their slumber , stirred , and rose every one ,— save those</l>
       <l n="19">Mute eunuchs of ebony , those frowning caryatides .</l>
       <l n="20">Slowly she looked at me , and when I cried again</l>
       <l n="21">In yearning and in pain , she beckoned with her hand .</l>
       <l n="22">Then from my knees rose I , and greatly daring ,</l>
       <l n="23">Through the hazy air , past the brazier flaring</l>
       <l n="24">And the hissing flame , crept , until I came</l>
       <l n="25">Unto the carven seat , and kissed her white feet ;</l>
       <l n="26">And she smiled , but spake not .</l>
       <l n="27">When she smiled the sleepers wavered as the grass</l>
       <l n="28">Of a cornfield wavers when the ears are swept</l>
       <l n="29">By the breath of brown reapers singing as they pass ,</l>
       <l n="30">Or grass of woody glades when a wind that has slept</l>
       <l n="31">Wakens , and invades their moonlit solitude ,</l>
       <l n="32">When the hazels shiver and the birch is blown</l>
       <l n="33">To a billow of silver , but oaks in the wood</l>
       <l n="34">Stand firm nor quiver , stand firm as stone :</l>
       <l n="35">So , amid the sleepers , the black eunuchs stood .</l>
       <l n="36">When the sleepers stirred faintly in the heat</l>
       <l n="37">Of that painted room a silken sound I heard ,</l>
       <l n="38">And a thin music , sweet as the brown nightingale</l>
       <l n="39">Sings in the jealous shade of a lonely spinney ,</l>
       <l n="40">Stranger far than any music mortal made</l>
       <l n="41">Fell softer than the dew falleth when stars are pale .</l>
       <l n="42">Sweet it was , and clear as light , or as the tears</l>
       <l n="43">That sad Narcissus wears in the spring of the year</l>
       <l n="44">On barren mountain ranges where rain falls cool</l>
       <l n="45">And every lonely pool is sprayed with broken light :</l>
       <l n="46">So cool , so beautiful , and so divinely strange</l>
       <l n="47">I doubted if it came from any marshy reed</l>
       <l n="48">Or hollow fluting stem pluck 'd by the hands of men ,</l>
       <l n="49">Unless it were indeed that airy fugitive</l>
       <l n="50">Syrinx , who cried and ran before the laughing eyes</l>
       <l n="51">Of goat-footed Pan , and must for ever live</l>
       <l n="52">A shadowy green reed by an Arcadian river —</l>
       <l n="53">But never music made of Ladon 's reedy daughter</l>
       <l n="54">Or singing river-water more sweet than that which stole ,</l>
       <l n="55">Slow as amber honey wells from the honeycomb ,</l>
       <l n="56">Into my weary soul with solace and strange peace .</l>
       <l n="57">So , trembling as I lay in a dream more desolate</l>
       <l n="58">Than is the darkened day of the mid-winter north ,</l>
       <l n="59">I heard the voice of one who sang in a strange tongue ,</l>
       <l n="60">And I know not what he sang save that he sang of love ,</l>
       <l n="61">The while they led me forth unheeding , till we came</l>
       <l n="62">Unto a chamber lit with one slow-burning flame</l>
       <l n="63">That yellow horn bedims , and laid me down , and there</l>
       <l n="64">They soothed my bruised limbs , and combed my tangled hair ,</l>
       <l n="65">And salved my limbs with rarely-mingled unguents pressed</l>
       <l n="66">By hands of holy ones who dream beneath the suns</l>
       <l n="67">Of Araby the Blest , and so , when they had bathed</l>
       <l n="68">My burning eyes with milk of dreamy anodyne</l>
       <l n="69">And cool 'd my throat with wine ,</l>
       <l n="70">In robings of cool silk my broken body they swathed ,</l>
       <l n="71">Sandals of gold they placed upon my feet , and round</l>
       <l n="72">My sad sun-blistered brows a silver fillet bound —</l>
       <l n="73">Decking me with the pride of a bridegroom that goes</l>
       <l n="74">To the joy of his bride and is lovely in her eyes —</l>
       <l n="75">And led me to her side . Then , as a conquering prince ,</l>
       <l n="76">I , who long since had been battered and tost</l>
       <l n="77">Like a dead leaf or ghost buffeted by wild storms ,</l>
       <l n="78">Came to her white arms , conquering , and was lost ,</l>
       <l n="79">Yet dared not gaze upon the beauty that I dreamed .</l>
       <l n="80">So , in my trance , it seemed that a shadowy soft dance</l>
       <l n="81">Coiled slowly and unwound , swayed , beckoned , and recovered</l>
       <l n="82">As hooded cobra bound by hollow spells of sound</l>
       <l n="83">Unto the piper sways ; so silently they hovered</l>
       <l n="84">I only heard the beat of their naked feet ,</l>
       <l n="85">And then , another sound ....</l>
       <l n="86">A dull throb thrumming , a noise of faint drumming ,</l>
       <l n="87">Threatening , coming nearer , piercing deeper</l>
       <l n="88">Than a dream lost in the heart of a sleeper</l>
       <l n="89">Into those deeps where the dark fire gloweth ,</l>
       <l n="90">The secret flame that every man knoweth ,</l>
       <l n="91">Embers that smoulder , fires that none can fan ,</l>
       <l n="92">Terrible , older than the mind of man ....</l>
       <l n="93">Before he crawled from his swamp and spurned</l>
       <l n="94">The life of the beast that dark fire burned</l>
       <l n="95">In the hidden deeps where no dream can come :</l>
       <l n="96">Only the throbbing of a drum</l>
       <l n="97">Can wake it from its smouldering —</l>
       <l n="98">Sightless , soundless , senseless , dumb —</l>
       <l n="99">Dumb as those blind seeds that lie</l>
       <l n="100">Drown 'd in mud , and shuddering ,</l>
       <l n="101">I knew that I was man no more ,</l>
       <l n="102">But a throbbing core of flesh , that knew</l>
       <l n="103">Nor beauty , nor truth , nor anything</l>
       <l n="104">But the black sky and the slimy earth :</l>
       <l n="105">Roots of trees , and fear , and pain ,</l>
       <l n="106">The blank of death , the pangs of birth ,</l>
       <l n="107">An inhuman thing possess 'd</l>
       <l n="108">By the throbbing of a drum :</l>
       <l n="109">And my lips were strange and numb ,</l>
       <l n="110">But they kissed her white breast ....</l>
       <l n="111">Then , being drunk with pride and splendour of love , I cried :</l>
       <l n="112">‘ " O spring of all delight , O mooned mystery ,</l>
       <l n="113">O living marvel , white as the dead queen of night ,</l>
       <l n="114">O flower , and O flame ... tell me at least thy name</l>
       <l n="115">That , from this desolate height , I may proclaim its wonder</l>
       <l n="116">To the lost lands hereunder before thy beauty dies</l>
       <l n="117">As fades the fire of dawn upon a peak of snow ! " ’</l>
       <l n="118">Then : “ Look , ” she sighed , “ into my eyes , and thou shalt know . ”</l>
       <l n="119">So , with her fingers frail , she pressed my brows , and so ,</l>
       <l n="120">Slowly , at last , she raised my drooping eyelids pale ,</l>
       <l n="121">And in her eyes I gazed .</l>
       <l n="122">‘ Then fear , than love more blind ,</l>
       <l n="123">Caught at my heart and fast in chains of horror bound —</l>
       <l n="124">As one who in profound and midnight forest ways</l>
       <l n="125">Sees in the dark the burning eyes of a tiger barred</l>
       <l n="126">Or stealthy footed pard blaze in a solemn hate</l>
       <l n="127">And lust of human blood , yet cannot cry , nor turning</l>
       <l n="128">Flee from the huddled wood , but stands and sees his fate ,</l>
       <l n="129">Or one who in a black night , groping for his track ,</l>
       <l n="130">Clings to the dizzy verge of a cragged precipice ,</l>
       <l n="131">Shrinks from the dim abyss , yet dare not venture back ,</l>
       <l n="132">And no sound hears but the hiss of empty air</l>
       <l n="133">Swirling past his ears .... So , in a hideous</l>
       <l n="134">Abandonment of hope , I waited for her kiss .</l>
       <l n="135">Then the restless beat of the muttering drum</l>
       <l n="136">Rose to a frenzied heat ; the naked dancers leapt</l>
       <l n="137">Insolent through the flame , laughing as they came</l>
       <l n="138">With parted lips ; their cries deadened my ears , my eyes</l>
       <l n="139">Throbbed with the pattering of their rapid feet ,</l>
       <l n="140">And the whirling dust of their dancing swept</l>
       <l n="141">Into my throat unslaked , dry-parched with love 's drought ,</l>
       <l n="142">Until my mouth was pressed upon her burning mouth</l>
       <l n="143">In a kiss most terrible .... Oh , was it pride , or shame</l>
       <l n="144">Unending , without name , or ecstasy , or pain</l>
       <l n="145">Or desperate desire ? Alas ! I cannot tell ,</l>
       <l n="146">Save that it pierced my trembling soul and body with fire .</l>
       <l n="147">For , while her soft lips clove to mine in love , she drove</l>
       <l n="148">A flaming blade of steel into my breast , and I ,</l>
       <l n="149">Rent with a bitter cry , slid from her side and fell</l>
       <l n="150">Clutching in dumb despair the dark unbraided hair</l>
       <l n="151">My passion had despoiled ; while she , like serpent coiled ,</l>
       <l n="152">Poised for another stroke , terribly , slowly , smiled ,</l>
       <l n="153">Saying : “ O stranger , red , red are my lips , and sweet</l>
       <l n="154">Unto those lips so red are the kisses of the dead :</l>
       <l n="155">Far hast thou wandered , far , for the kisses of Thamar . ”</l>
       <l n="156">Then a deep silence fell on the frenzy and the laughter ;</l>
       <l n="157">The leaping dancers crept to the shadows where they had slept ,</l>
       <l n="158">And the mute eunuchs stood forth , and hugely bent</l>
       <l n="159">Above my body , spent in its pool of blood ,</l>
       <l n="160">And hove me with black arms , while the queen followed after</l>
       <l n="161">With stealthy steps , and eyes that burned into the night</l>
       <l n="162">Of my dying brain , till , with her hand , she bade</l>
       <l n="163">Them falter , and they stayed , while , eagerly , she propped</l>
       <l n="164">My listless head that dropped downward from my shoulders ,</l>
       <l n="165">And slowly raised it up , raised it like a cup</l>
       <l n="166">Unto her lips again ,</l>
       <l n="167">Then shuddered , trembled , shrunk , as though her mouth had drunk</l>
       <l n="168">A potion where the fell fire of poison smoulders .</l>
       <l n="169">And a darkness came , and I could see no more ,</l>
       <l n="170">But in my ears the roar of lonely torrents swelled</l>
       <l n="171">And stilled my breath for ever , as though a wave appalling</l>
       <l n="172">Had broken in my brain , and deep to deep were calling :</l>
       <l n="173">And I felt my body falling down and down and down</l>
       <l n="174">Into a blank of death , where dumb waters roll</l>
       <l n="175">Endlessly , only knowing , that her dagger had stabbed my breast ,</l>
       <l n="176">But her kiss had killed my soul .</l>
       <l n="177">And now I know no rest until again I stand</l>
       <l n="178">Where that lost city 's towers rise from the dreamy sand ,</l>
       <l n="179">Until I reach the gate where the lips of Asia wait ,</l>
       <l n="180">Till I cross the desert 's drought , and the rivers of the south ,</l>
       <l n="181">And shiver through the night under those summits white</l>
       <l n="182">That soar above Cathay ; until I see the light</l>
       <l n="183">Flame from those tyrannous glooms where , like a tired star</l>
       <l n="184">In stormy darkness , looms the castle of Thamar . ’</l>

       <l n="1">Now that the hour has come , and under the lonely</l>
       <l n="2">Darkness I stumble at the doors of death ,</l>
       <l n="3">It is not hope , nor faith</l>
       <l n="4">That here my spirit sustaineth , but love only .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="5">In visions , in love : only there have I clutched at divinity :</l>
       <l n="6">But the vision fadeth ; yet love fades not : and for this</l>
       <l n="7">I would have you know that your kiss</l>
       <l n="8">Was more to me than all my hopes of infinity .</l>

       <l n="9">Therein you made me divine ... you , who were moon and sun for</l>
