    <docTitle><titlePart>Two simple words , charged now for some of us with sad and infinite memories . It is not the death of the Professor , nor of the soldier , nor of the politician — nor even of the poet or the essayist — that causes the heart-ache that we feel . It is the loss of that rare , charming , wondrous personality summed up in those two simple words , TOM KETTLE . A genial cynic , a pleasant pessimist , an earnest trifler , he was made up of contradictions . A fellow of infinite jest — and infinite sadness . His prototypes were Hamlet or the Melancholy Jacques . Among the delightful essays he has left us in that charming little book , The Day 's Burden , is one entitled “ A new way of misunderstanding Hamlet . ” He was himself a veritable Hamlet in this twentieth century Ireland . One may ask , did he quite understand himself ? Master of paradox , enunciator of enigma , he was a paradox and an enigma in , and to , himself . Shall we seek now to pluck out the heart of his mystery ? The lines are hackneyed beyond hope , but in this instance they apply in truth . The personality of Kettle had in it something subtle ; something essential yet elusive ; something not to be defined . He was a great talker in the Johnsonian sense . As a story-teller , it was not so much the point of his tale that counted as his telling of it . The divagations from the text in which he loved to indulge were the delight of his auditors . With truth it may be said that his rich humour , his brilliant , mordant wit , caused his listeners to hang upon his words . And his outlook was so wide , his soul so big , his mind so broad , and a deep love of humanity so permeated him that his talk , or one might more fittingly say , his discourse , was educating and uplifting . But he was a man of moods , descending from heights of Homeric humour to the depths of a divine despair . Those privileged to hear him thus expounding will cherish the memory while they live . We , too , as it were , have “ seen Shelley plain . ” He charmed , he fascinated . This , in truth , describes him for his spell wrought even on those who actually disliked him . In the numerous notices printed of him since he died much has been written of the promise of his career . More appropriate it would be to write of his performance . He crowded into thirty-six years of life far more than most men achieve in twice that span . Now the orator is silent , the brilliant wit has ceased to sparkle , the skilful pen will ply no more . Tom Kettle knows at last the answer to the riddle that baffled him , the Riddle of the Universe . Well may we mourn — For Lycidas is dead ; Young Lycidas : dead ere his prime , And hath not left his peer . WILLIAM DAWSON .</titlePart></docTitle>

      <head>ON LEAVING IRELAND</head>
      <head>( JULY 14 , 1916 )</head>
       <l n="1">The pathos of departure is indubitable .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>I never felt my own essay “ On saying Good-Bye ” so profoundly aux trefonds du coeur . The sun was a clear globe of blood which we caught hanging over Ben Edar , with a trail of pure blood vibrating to us across the waves . It dropped into darkness before we left the deck . Some lines came to me , suggested by a friend who thought the mood cynical .</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">As the sun died in blood , and hill and sea</l>
       <l n="2">Grew to an altar , red with mystery ,</l>
       <l n="3">One came who knew me ( it may be over-much )</l>
       <l n="4">Seeking the cynical and staining touch ,</l>
       <l n="5">But I , against the great sun 's burial</l>
       <l n="6">Thought only of bayonet-flash and bugle-call ,</l>
       <l n="7">And saw him as God 's eye upon the deep ,</l>
       <l n="8">Closed in the dream in which no women weep ,</l>
       <l n="9">And knew that even I shall fall on sleep .</l>

     </lg>
     <p>It is done inexpiably ; thrust him deep in shameful clay , Charge his name with every foulness , rule the world 's ear as you may — But the shadow at your banquet that you cannot put away !</p>
     <p>Weak you thought him , sickness-vanquished , given to your eager hate . So you played him and you slew him with your feline shows of state , Weak — and lo ! the sanctifying touch of death has made him great .</p>
     <p>As a seed that broadening splits the rock on which a palace stands , As a trickling breach that godlike parts one land in hostile lands , Is the memory of Scheepers and his slaying at your hands .</p>
     <p>Hill and plain and stream shall guard it , town and fireside , phrase and song ; Young men 's unsubdued aspiring , old men 's striving wise and strong ; And though Hope die , Hatred may not for remembrance of his wrong .</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">Murdered leader — may God fold you in the mercy of His temple ,</l>

       <l n="3">My thought that had the unperforming years</l>
       <l n="4">Amended and laid the base of heaven true ;</l>
       <l n="5">But pitying , signed me priest with chrismal dew ,</l>

       <l n="7">Of Hate cast out with all his sworded peers ,</l>
       <l n="8">And tower-tops spiring to the gods anew .</l>
       <l n="9">One gibed , one wept , one with his drowsed air</l>
       <l n="10">Chilled me to very stone , but no man hearkened ;</l>

       <l n="55">Free , we are free to be your friend .</l>
       <l n="56">And when you make your banquet , and we come ,</l>
       <l n="57">Soldier with equal soldier must we sit ,</l>
       <l n="58">Closing a battle , not forgetting it .</l>
       <l n="59">With not a name to hide ,</l>
       <l n="60">This mate and mother of valiant “ rebels ” dead</l>
       <l n="61">Must come with all her history on her head .</l>
       <l n="62">We keep the past for pride :</l>
       <l n="63">No deepest peace shall strike our poets dumb :</l>
       <l n="64">No rawest squad of all Death 's volunteers ,</l>
       <l n="65">No rudest man who died</l>
       <l n="66">To tear your flag down in the bitter years ,</l>
       <l n="67">But shall have praise , and three times thrice again ,</l>
       <l n="68">When at that table men shall drink with men .</l>
