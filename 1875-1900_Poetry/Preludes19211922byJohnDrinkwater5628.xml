     <l n="2">Though black the night , I know upon the sky ,</l>
     <l n="3">A little paler now , if clouds were none ,</l>
     <l n="4">The stars would be . Husht now the thickets lie ,</l>
     <l n="5">And now the birds are moving one by one ,—</l>
     <l n="6">A note — and now from bush to bush it goes —</l>
     <l n="7">A prelude — now victorious light along</l>
     <l n="8">The west will come till every bramble glows</l>
     <l n="9">With wash of sunlit dew shaken in song .</l>
     <l n="10">Shaken in song ; O heart , be ready now ,</l>
     <l n="11">Cold in your night , be ready now to sing .</l>
     <l n="12">Dawn as it wakes the sleeping bird on bough</l>
     <l n="13">Shall summon you to instant reckoning ,—</l>
     <l n="14">She is your dawn , O heart ,— sing , till the night</l>
     <l n="15">Of death shall come , the gospel of her light .</l>

    <head>DAVID AND JONATHAN</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">And Jonathan too had honour in his heart ,</l>
     <l n="2">Jonathan who with an armour-bearer went</l>
     <l n="3">Alone by Michmash to the Philistines ,</l>
     <l n="4">And met a spray of swords because of courage</l>
     <l n="5">That made him single greater than a host .</l>
     <l n="6">Jonathan too had known his battles , dared</l>
     <l n="7">At any hour the coming of death , because</l>
     <l n="8">In twilight silence he had walked with God ,</l>
     <l n="9">Read Him in blossoms and the mountain brooks ,</l>
     <l n="10">And learnt that death , well known , can alter nothing .</l>
     <l n="11">He was a brown man , burnt with love of summer ,</l>
     <l n="12">His young beard curled , and russet as the eyes</l>
     <l n="13">That looked on life , and feared it , yet were master ,</l>
     <l n="14">Because they knew the tyranny they feared ,</l>
     <l n="15">Measured it , learnt it , gazed it into nothing .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="16">....</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="17">And now he watched the boy , the son of Jesse ,</l>
     <l n="18">David with hair like maples in October ,</l>
     <l n="19">And skin that women loving coveted ,</l>
     <l n="20">David with eyes that often by the sheepfolds</l>
     <l n="21">Had looked through leaves up to the folds of heaven ,</l>
     <l n="22">And seeing them crammed with golden fleece of stars ,</l>
     <l n="23">Had known how the blood can run because of beauty .</l>
     <l n="24">Jonathan watched him take the armour off</l>
     <l n="25">Given by Saul , and choose the bright smooth pebbles ,</l>
     <l n="26">And walk out from the Israelitish throng</l>
     <l n="27">Into the field against the Philistine giant .</l>
     <l n="28">Watching , he snatched his sword and cried to Saul ,</l>
     <l n="29">“ Bid him come back . This murder must not be . ”</l>
     <l n="30">And as he spoke , he knew the words were treason ,</l>
     <l n="31">His heart alone in all the world was sure</l>
     <l n="32">That David was the Lord 's appointed arm ,</l>
     <l n="33">To meet this bulk of dirt , this giant fear</l>
     <l n="34">Brandishing out of the loathly camps of evil .</l>
     <l n="35">And before Saul could answer , he put down</l>
     <l n="36">The sword , and said , “ I love him . Let him go . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="37">....</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="38">But the words , I love him , were not for his father Saul ,</l>
     <l n="39">Hardly Jonathan knowing he spake them out .</l>
     <l n="40">But as he looked on David love was there ,</l>
     <l n="41">Waking from that in David that he himself</l>
     <l n="42">A little was , and always greatly shaping</l>
     <l n="43">Himself towards , so that his name was spoken</l>
     <l n="44">Famously in Saul 's kingdom . It was courage ,</l>
     <l n="45">The clean heart , undivided in its doing ,</l>
     <l n="46">The purpose that , being bodied in the brain ,</l>
     <l n="47">Thenceforth knew every trickling argument</l>
     <l n="48">That fell from tongues of persuading circumstance ,</l>
     <l n="49">As lures of evil ever threatening life ,</l>
     <l n="50">That Jonathan loved above all enterprise .</l>
     <l n="51">He knew , or the rarer man within him knew ,</l>
     <l n="52">That once your yea in holy meditation</l>
     <l n="53">Had shaped itself in the perfect syllable ,</l>
     <l n="54">Thenceforth no nay from any other tongue</l>
     <l n="55">Or wise or passionate or masterful ,</l>
     <l n="56">Could be listened to without the shame of sin</l>
     <l n="57">Corrupting all your constancy for ever .</l>
     <l n="58">He knew the curse of good betraying good ,</l>
     <l n="59">Till both in bleak irresolution fall .</l>
     <l n="60">And all his years was Jonathan 's anguish only</l>
     <l n="61">To keep this tillage of his wisdom clean .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="62">.....</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="63">Since boyhood he had known Philistia</l>
     <l n="64">For the black thing it was , a plague opposed</l>
     <l n="65">Always against the loveliness of Israel ,</l>
     <l n="66">And when his father Saul was anointed king</l>
     <l n="67">By Samuel in Ramah , then Jonathan knew</l>
     <l n="68">How all the lessons of his youth had been</l>
     <l n="69">To fit him for the striking of the men</l>
     <l n="70">Who profaned beauty and let the soul be blind .</l>
     <l n="71">And he was diligent in bronze and arms ,</l>
     <l n="72">And kept his body supple , and his eye</l>
     <l n="73">Keen , and the coming of his hooves was thunder ,</l>
     <l n="74">Wherever battle fell . He bore a flame ,</l>
     <l n="75">Zealous and pure , in the heavens of his mind ,</l>
     <l n="76">To serve and to instruct . Aye , to instruct —</l>
     <l n="77">There was the biting blemish , as we shall see .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="78">.....</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="79">Philistia was foul , and Jonathan knew ,</l>
     <l n="80">And the voice of God within him was plain and constant</l>
     <l n="81">To strike and strike unwearying to the end .</l>
     <l n="82">And then the poor , precise , infirmity</l>
     <l n="83">That loads good minds with ever seeming virtue ,</l>
     <l n="84">Until they cast their treasure to the dust ,</l>
     <l n="85">Crept on him , wound about the gleaming truth</l>
     <l n="86">That was his one foundation . Day by day</l>
     <l n="87">He was resolved , and then the grain of doubt</l>
     <l n="88">Would come to hurt the riding of his thought ,</l>
     <l n="89">And break the level balance that it had .</l>
     <l n="90">Was then the Philistine mere black ? That day</l>
     <l n="91">Jonathan 's arm half paused upon the blow ,</l>
     <l n="92">And evil went a little scatheless off .</l>
     <l n="93">Surely the worst even of adversaries</l>
     <l n="94">Had somewhere beams that pointed to salvation ,</l>
     <l n="95">And hasty judgment might not be the will</l>
     <l n="96">Of an all-seeing Lord ? Then would the vengeance</l>
     <l n="97">Falter , and stay , and Jonathan 's battle failed .</l>
     <l n="98">And always then was bitterness and reproach</l>
     <l n="99">In the night watches when upon his couch</l>
     <l n="100">He looked on the stars studding his little window</l>
     <l n="101">Before sleep came . Then he would speak again</l>
     <l n="102">The word that single was his valiance ,</l>
     <l n="103">His only truth , his warrant as a man ,</l>
     <l n="104">And once again Philistia was doomed .</l>
     <l n="105">Then for a season clean the stroke and sure</l>
     <l n="106">That Jonathan drove , and black was known for black ,</l>
     <l n="107">Till slowly as before would mount and mount</l>
     <l n="108">Scruple on scruple , as was not he himself</l>
     <l n="109">A little black sometimes , or plainly wicked ?</l>
     <l n="110">And should the wicked man not be redeemed ?</l>
     <l n="111">Merely destruction surely was no answer ,</l>
     <l n="112">Since yet the wickedness must wander somewhere ?</l>
     <l n="113">How should he say , I , Jonathan of Israel</l>
     <l n="114">Am good , and you the Philistine are cursed ,</l>
     <l n="115">Since in that face was something that had been</l>
     <l n="116">Learnt from the buds and corn and frozen hills</l>
     <l n="117">That he himself had known for seals of God ?</l>
     <l n="118">And would not his power on Israel increase ,</l>
     <l n="119">Take on a loftier authority ,</l>
     <l n="120">If to his famous arms he could add a tale</l>
     <l n="121">Of counsel working in the hearts of men ,</l>
     <l n="122">Moving them to a finer charity ,</l>
     <l n="123">A little pity for offence ? And so</l>
     <l n="124">Instruction like a worm was at his roots ,</l>
     <l n="125">And pride of virtue made Jonathan forget .</l>
     <l n="126">Then sometimes as he knew himself betrayed</l>
     <l n="127">He would cry upon his spirit in the night —</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="128">I , Jonathan , who know</l>
     <l n="129">The processes of God</l>
     <l n="130">Moving within me ,</l>
     <l n="131">Turn aside to my idols of desire .</l>
     <l n="132">He has taught me the ways</l>
     <l n="133">Of Philistine cruelty . He</l>
     <l n="134">Shows me the bad man toiling to the ruin</l>
     <l n="135">Of beauty and the free spirit on earth ,</l>
     <l n="136">And has equipped me for the establishment</l>
     <l n="137">Of His will in this battle , and I fail .</l>
     <l n="138">I am a leaf spinning about the wind ,</l>
     <l n="139">Who have been shown the ways of stedfastness .</l>
     <l n="140">O Israel , I have heard</l>
     <l n="141">My dedication made</l>
     <l n="142">To your sweet service by the voice of Him ,</l>
     <l n="143">And I betray</l>
     <l n="144">That wisdom , that great simpleness of wisdom ,</l>
     <l n="145">Inventing in my brain</l>
     <l n="146">Fantastic argument</l>
     <l n="147">As though God 's mind</l>
     <l n="148">Had missed the brighter pools</l>
     <l n="149">That I alone could visit and gaze into .</l>
     <l n="150">He tells me , and I hear</l>
     <l n="151">Voices not His .</l>
     <l n="152">Knowing , I question . And I am ashamed .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="153">So Jonathan saw walking at his side</l>
     <l n="154">Always a shadow that was his own denial .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="155">.....</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="156">And now was April mirrored in the plumes</l>
     <l n="157">Of ravens and the green of the young wheat ,</l>
     <l n="158">And dusky ewes with white lambs in the sun</l>
     <l n="159">Lay in the valley plain between the hosts</l>
     <l n="160">Of Israel and Philistia . And on this day</l>
     <l n="161">Jonathan learnt utter reproach , and love .</l>
     <l n="162">There on the plain Goliath stood alone ,</l>
     <l n="163">Poised in his mighty bulk , with black locks flowing ,</l>
     <l n="164">A handsbreadth taller even than Saul the king</l>
     <l n="165">Who shouldered it above the men of Israel ,</l>
     <l n="166">And beat his words of sure defiance out ,</l>
     <l n="167">Ringing across the windless noon . And all</l>
     <l n="168">Israel heard , and fear was on them , knowing ,</l>
     <l n="169">If thus the issue , how it should prevail .</l>
     <l n="170">And Jonathan in the tent of Saul his father ,</l>
     <l n="171">Watched , and his blood was quick , and in his mind</l>
     <l n="172">He strove against the last of doubt . And then</l>
     <l n="173">The young man David stood before them , bidden</l>
     <l n="174">By Saul , who heard one say , “ There is a boy</l>
     <l n="175">New come from tending sheep in Bethlehem ,</l>
     <l n="176">And seeks the king . ” And David stood before them ,</l>
     <l n="177">And asked no leave , but said , “ There was a cause .</l>
     <l n="178">It bade me come , and I will fight with him . ”</l>
     <l n="179">And Saul denied , but David did not hear</l>
     <l n="180">Denial , saying , “ the wild beasts of the field</l>
     <l n="181">I with my hand have slain at the fold 's gate ,</l>
     <l n="182">And this is mine to do . ” And David stood ,</l>
     <l n="183">Greater than argument while Saul armed him there .</l>
     <l n="184">And Jonathan saw the purpose that he was not ,</l>
     <l n="185">Glowing and bodied , and his love was born .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="186">.....</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="187">Then David flung the armour off , and said ,</l>
     <l n="188">“ I am David , and I know not these strange arms .</l>
     <l n="189">I must go out as I have always been ,</l>
     <l n="190">Not girt with new occasion . It is I ,</l>
     <l n="191">David the shepherd that am David still ,</l>
     <l n="192">And I know nothing of your spears and plate .</l>
     <l n="193">A sheepskin have I worn , and in my hand</l>
     <l n="194">A sling , and pebbles taken from the brook .</l>
     <l n="195">Now shall I go , content that God has watched me</l>
     <l n="196">So habited and armed through all my youth .</l>
     <l n="197">Should I pretend another David now ,</l>
     <l n="198">I should meet this man with neither honour nor hope .</l>
     <l n="199">If I am sent against the Philistine</l>
     <l n="200">Out of God 's anger , and I know it is so ,</l>
     <l n="201">It is not one the chosen of Saul 's hosts ,</l>
     <l n="202">But I , David of Bethlehem must go ,</l>
     <l n="203">The son of Jesse , and keeper of his flocks . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="204">.....</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="205">Almost the tears were seen in Jonathan 's eyes ,</l>
     <l n="206">Because of David 's words , of which he knew</l>
     <l n="207">The poor ghosts hiding somewhere in his own heart .</l>
     <l n="208">And then he spoke his fear , and then the words ,</l>
     <l n="209">Resting his sword , “ I love him . Let him go . ”</l>
     <l n="210">And David stept out of the emerald light</l>
     <l n="211">That played up from the grass floor of the tent ,</l>
     <l n="212">Into the full flood of the April noon ,</l>
     <l n="213">And walked a little way , and those two stood</l>
     <l n="214">Parted a hundred paces , the man of terror ,</l>
     <l n="215">Hewn massy and with shock of builded limbs ,</l>
     <l n="216">And David moulded like a sea boy risen</l>
     <l n="217">From caves of music where the water spins</l>
     <l n="218">Wet sand into the shapes of flowing flowers ;</l>
     <l n="219">David with limbs all bright with the sun 's tones ,</l>
     <l n="220">And ruddy locks curling with youth and light ,</l>
     <l n="221">His body all alert on steady loins ,</l>
     <l n="222">Clean spun of flesh that knew the winter snows ,</l>
     <l n="223">And mellow pools of summer , and the dews</l>
     <l n="224">Dropping among the crocuses of dawn .</l>
     <l n="225">His sandle-straps bound ankles as a girl 's ,</l>
     <l n="226">And fluttering to his knees the sheepskin hung ,</l>
     <l n="227">Cloaking one shoulder , while the other gleamed .</l>
     <l n="228">And there he paused , the sling in his right hand ,</l>
     <l n="229">His left hand fingering the pouch of pebbles ,</l>
     <l n="230">While Israel fearing murmured , and the hosts</l>
     <l n="231">Of Philistine derision rocked the noon .</l>
     <l n="232">Then did Goliath cry , “ Am I a dog ,</l>
     <l n="233">For a boy 's whipping ? Have you not a man ,</l>

     <l n="237">And Jonathan heard Philistia shout again ,</l>
     <l n="238">And David , like a flame unwinded , stood</l>
     <l n="239">Quivering at the cry , and laid a stone</l>
     <l n="240">In the sling 's fold , and cast his staff , and ran ,</l>
     <l n="241">Fleet as the king bird gliding under leaves ,</l>
     <l n="242">Towards Goliath . And a giant spear</l>
     <l n="243">Swung from the Philistine hand , and forty paces</l>
     <l n="244">Sang in the air and brushed the flying sheepskin ,</l>
     <l n="245">And sudden David 's feet were planted firm ,</l>
     <l n="246">Locked on the earth , and circling in the sun</l>
     <l n="247">The tight thong flashed and loosened , and the stone</l>
     <l n="248">Smote the Philistine wrath above the eyes ,</l>
     <l n="249">And the day was clouded from him , and he fell .</l>

     <l n="251">Then Israel spared not . And , when night was come ,</l>
     <l n="252">Jonathan sent for David to his tent ,</l>
     <l n="253">And those two sat while the yellow torches burned ,</l>
     <l n="254">And Jonathan spoke and said , “ David , my brother ,</l>
     <l n="255">To-day you have made a story that shall be</l>
     <l n="256">For ever fruitful in the heart of man .</l>
     <l n="257">This day is David 's . But of this day I too</l>
     <l n="258">Share , not in the honour , but in the harvesting ,</l>
     <l n="259">Or the harvesting I think is wholly mine .</l>
     <l n="260">Shall I speak on ? ” And David said , “ Speak on . ”</l>
     <l n="261">Then Jonathan — “ This morning there was a man ,</l>
     <l n="262">And it was Jonathan , who many years</l>
     <l n="263">Had gone snared in a purpose not his own ,</l>
     <l n="264">That is , not truly mine . Always I knew ,</l>
     <l n="265">Walking by that self I said was honest ,</l>
     <l n="266">Another self , the true self , in a shadow ,</l>
     <l n="267">Or at an angle that my eyes refused .</l>
     <l n="268">I was a proud man , David , very virtuous ,</l>
     <l n="269">Or , in fairness to myself , desiring virtue ,</l>
     <l n="270">Truly desiring it , I may say that .</l>
     <l n="271">And yet even in that desire there moved</l>
     <l n="272">A lie , for I knew the virtue of my desire</l>
     <l n="273">Was something tainted . No — I knew it not ,</l>
     <l n="274">But that other self walking beside me knew it ,</l>
     <l n="275">And whispered , I knew , a thing that I would not hear .</l>
     <l n="276">Always it whispered , as I stood alone ,</l>
     <l n="277">I said , in subtle thought among all Israel .</l>
     <l n="278">God had spoken to me , David , that the Philistine</l>
     <l n="279">Was evil , evil , that was all God said ,</l>
     <l n="280">And bade me strike as a man by God assured .</l>
     <l n="281">But the man to whom God spoke I put aside ,</l>
     <l n="282">The still self walking , whispering , in the shadow .</l>
     <l n="283">And I , the Jonathan of daily light ,</l>
     <l n="284">Tempered the word of God , I tempered it —</l>
     <l n="285">I who should be God 's outcast doing so .</l>
     <l n="286">I counted evil twenty different ways ,</l>
     <l n="287">And none of them plain evil . I diced with God ,</l>
     <l n="288">And the dice fell as often to my hand ,</l>
     <l n="289">It seemed , as His , but falling so the whisper</l>
     <l n="290">Was ever shadowed at my ear , unheard .</l>
     <l n="291">And ever as this new intelligence ,</l>
     <l n="292">This pride of thought , crept over me and filled</l>
     <l n="293">My dawn and noon and sleep , a hunger grew ,</l>
     <l n="294">A dreadful hunger for that self denied ,</l>
     <l n="295">And every word I spoke for righteousness</l>
     <l n="296">Turned bitter on my lips , because I knew</l>
     <l n="297">That every word was righteousness undone .</l>
     <l n="298">Such was the man this morning when you came ,</l>
     <l n="299">Who from the king 's tent watched you , David . Then</l>
     <l n="300">Change and completion and I know not what</l>
     <l n="301">Of heavenly fulfilment fell upon me .</l>
     <l n="302">Not from myself , nor of my own devising ,</l>
     <l n="303">But marvellously spoken in a space</l>
     <l n="304">Of golden light that glowed about the form</l>
     <l n="305">Of a boy standing in my father 's tent .</l>
     <l n="306">Quite suddenly the thing I lacked was there ,</l>
     <l n="307">The shadow whispering at my side had gone</l>
     <l n="308">And stood there bodied in you , David , brother ,</l>
     <l n="309">O dear young shepherd from your sheepfolds called —</l>
     <l n="310">Nay Jonathan myself it was there standing ,</l>
     <l n="311">Or barren branches of myself in flower ,</l>
     <l n="312">My jailored thought flooded with light of song .</l>
     <l n="313">And in that moment nothing was between</l>
     <l n="314">Your soul and mine , and knowing you , I loved ,</l>
     <l n="315">Since love is understanding , and must come</l>
     <l n="316">When mind looks on the presence of very mind .</l>
     <l n="317">I loved you , David , and I love , and ever —</l>
     <l n="318">Because my mind , even in one day 's passing ,</l>
     <l n="319">Has learnt you as no years could better learn —</l>
     <l n="320">My love is fixed upon you . And , moreover ,</l>
     <l n="321">Since from this hour I must for ever know</l>
     <l n="322">Some element of me lodged sole in you ,</l>
     <l n="323">Some certainty in you alone to be</l>
     <l n="324">Among my weeds the patient husbandman ,</l>
     <l n="325">I must in your love prosper or not at all .</l>
     <l n="326">Now therefore , David , let a covenant be</l>
     <l n="327">Between us from this day , for the heart knows . ”</l>

     <l n="329">David and Jonathan under the long torches</l>
     <l n="330">Were silent then . And David 's eyes were fixed</l>
     <l n="331">Long upon Jonathan , as eyes may sometimes look</l>

     <l n="346">I know , and as your will is so is mine .</l>
     <l n="347">Something I am for you that none can be .</l>
     <l n="348">Let it be so , but all is not then said .</l>
     <l n="349">This morning when I smote the Philistine ,</l>
     <l n="350">I was God 's purpose , that I must believe .</l>
     <l n="351">But purpose only is not all of God ,</l>
     <l n="352">Hearing you now , I know it is not all .</l>
     <l n="353">When first I saw you I did not know it then —</l>
     <l n="354">Only , facing the Philistine , something new</l>
     <l n="355">A moment marked me , and unnoted went ,</l>
     <l n="356">No touch of it upon my will . But now</l>
     <l n="357">I have heard you speak , and what it was I know .</l>
     <l n="358">You loved me , Jonathan , seeing , as I stood ,</l>
     <l n="359">That shadowy self of you of which you tell me</l>
     <l n="360">Suddenly living fearless in the sun .</l>
     <l n="361">That is your reaping of my field , and I</l>
     <l n="362">Glory to give it you . But were that all ,</l>
     <l n="363">Proud to be loved , I should not love again .</l>
     <l n="364">But now I know for me is too a reaping .</l>
     <l n="365">Your shadow to my living purpose leaps ,</l>
     <l n="366">And that is wonderful . But as you spoke</l>
     <l n="367">Some David hidden from the man that slew</l>
     <l n="368">Goliath listened also , and is now</l>
     <l n="369">With us for ever . And he that wrought this life</l>
     <l n="370">Is you , Jonathan of doubts and speculation ,</l>
     <l n="371">The man who sits there plainly now , the mere</l>
     <l n="372">Jonathan when the shadow is forgotten .</l>
     <l n="373">Now do I know my purpose magnified ,</l>
     <l n="374">Sure as of old , but learning in its flight ,</l>
     <l n="375">Of pity and the sad heart of man from you ,</l>
     <l n="376">And how the jealous and unmerciful ,</l>
     <l n="377">Being stricken down , are but poor sorrows too .</l>
     <l n="378">So , Jonathan my brother , as you take ,</l>
     <l n="379">So do you give , and in us now shall be</l>
     <l n="380">The perfect whole of purpose and compassion ,</l>
     <l n="381">And resolution without pride of heart .</l>
     <l n="382">Now therefore will I make the covenant ,</l>
     <l n="383">Knowing that never more can you or I</l>
     <l n="384">Without this love be better than a tale</l>
     <l n="385">Of corrupting seed and fallow-lands unsown . ”</l>

     <l n="24">Syria out of Israel had brought</l>
     <l n="25">Captives , and among them one , a maid ,</l>
     <l n="26">A little maid , just troubled with the touch</l>
     <l n="27">Of womanhood upon her body and thought ,</l>
     <l n="28">And she served Naaman 's wife , a lonely girl ,</l>
     <l n="29">To answer bidding , and covet little tones</l>
     <l n="30">Of kindness that she heard go to and fro ,</l>
     <l n="31">But not for her . She trembled as she stood</l>
     <l n="32">At the proud woman 's couch , because a fault</l>
     <l n="33">In orders done meant scolding and even rods .</l>
     <l n="34">And she had but two joys . One , to remember</l>
     <l n="35">A Galilean town , and the blue waters</l>
     <l n="36">That washed the pebbles that she knew so well ,</l>
     <l n="37">Yellow in sunlight , or frozen in the moon ,</l>
     <l n="38">A little curve of beach , where she would walk</l>
     <l n="39">At any hour with an old silver man .</l>
     <l n="40">Her father 's father , her sole companion ,</l>
     <l n="41">Who told her tales of Moses and the prophets</l>
     <l n="42">That lived in the old days . And of that time</l>
     <l n="43">She had but now poor treasuries of the mind ,</l>
     <l n="44">Little seclusions when , the day 's work done ,</l>
     <l n="45">She made thought into prayer before she slept ;</l>
     <l n="46">These , and a faded gown that she had brought</l>
     <l n="47">Into captivity , patterned with sprigs of thyme ,</l>
     <l n="48">And blades of wheat , and little curling shells ,</l>
     <l n="49">And signs of heaven figured out in stars ,</l>
     <l n="50">Made by a weaver that her grandsire knew ,</l>
     <l n="51">A gift on some thanksgiving . She might not wear it ,</l>
     <l n="52">Being suited as became a slave , but often</l>
     <l n="53">At night she would spread it in her loneliness ,</l>
     <l n="54">And think how finely she too might be drest ,</l>
     <l n="55">As finely as any proud woman of them all ,</l>
     <l n="56">If the God of Israel had not visited her</l>
     <l n="57">Surely for sin , though she could not remember .</l>
     <l n="58">Thus one joy was . And then the Lord Naaman ,</l>
     <l n="59">This wonder soiled , this pitiful great captain</l>
     <l n="60">Forbidden all that he had so proudly been —</l>
     <l n="61">To worship him , that was her other joy .</l>
     <l n="62">When the dusk came , and the city fell to silence ,</l>
     <l n="63">And out of his poor banishment he would walk ,</l>
     <l n="64">She followed him , knowing the very hour ,</l>
     <l n="65">And all her heart was flooded through with pity ,</l>
     <l n="66">Because she knew the leprosy left still</l>
     <l n="67">A Naaman untainted and lovely .</l>
     <l n="68">Then in her mind was the proud woman a loathing ,</l>
     <l n="69">Who dared to waste a marvel such as this ,</l>
     <l n="70">The right in the world 's knowledge so to love .</l>
     <l n="71">O pitiful evil blasting so great a flesh ,</l>
     <l n="72">Walling a spirit so governing itself</l>
     <l n="73">In spite of desolation . A maid 's thought thus</l>

     <l n="1">Full summer dusk was round him as he stood</l>
     <l n="2">On the hill-top , over the calling sheep</l>
     <l n="3">Drifting along the pastured downs . The moon</l>
     <l n="4">Far off was rising from the Sussex sea .</l>
     <l n="5">Above him , building up into the sky ,</l>
     <l n="6">Black , and with pointing sails now skeletoned ,</l>
     <l n="7">A windmill gathered strays of evening wind</l>
     <l n="8">Whispering through the splitting timbers . Still</l>
     <l n="9">The setting sun washed with a fuller gold</l>
     <l n="10">The golden sheaves patterned upon a cone</l>
     <l n="11">Of downland by him farther from the sea .</l>
     <l n="12">So still , he seemed a thing woven of earth ,</l>
     <l n="13">A life rooted and fixed as were the oaks</l>
     <l n="14">Locked in the soil , their bases webbed with fleece</l>
     <l n="15">Of sheltering ewes , he watched across the valley ,</l>
     <l n="16">And the hour passed , and the black mill grew and grew ,</l>
     <l n="17">And then a light came in a far window</l>
     <l n="18">Of a grey farm cresting the hill beyond ,</l>
     <l n="19">And sudden tides beat on him as he saw</l>
     <l n="20">A white dress moving in the distant pines .</l>

     <l n="22">Lake Winter , a five hundred acre man ,</l>
     <l n="23">Was English , bred far back , a part of England ,</l>
     <l n="24">With South and North and Midland in his blood .</l>
     <l n="25">And somewhere Devon , somewhere Suffolk too .</l>
     <l n="26">He had been born of love . They had been lovers ,</l>
     <l n="27">Who made him , and no more , but they were lovers .</l>
     <l n="28">She of a proud house , proud to make it prouder</l>
     <l n="29">With wit and beauty , and a young brain glowing ,</l>
     <l n="30">And a swift body fearless and pitiful ;</l>
     <l n="31">And he a Cotswold yeoman , thrift and power ,</l>
     <l n="32">And mastery of earth and herds and flocks ,</l>
     <l n="33">And knowledge of all seasons and their fruits ,</l>
     <l n="34">And a heart of meditation , all his birthright ;</l>
     <l n="35">Ten generations deep from Gloucester stone .</l>

     <l n="37">Came a new purity of blood and limb ,</l>
     <l n="38">As of a purpose slowly moulding them .</l>
     <l n="39">And long they waited , and then one summer noon ,</l>
     <l n="40">He , coming northward from his Cotswold home ,</l>
     <l n="41">Found her by Rydal as she had bidden him ,</l>
     <l n="42">And proudly stride to stride they took the road ,</l>
     <l n="43">Sure youth by youth , and to Helvellyn 's foot</l>
     <l n="44">They came , and climbed up to the brighter air ,</l>
     <l n="45">And into the wind 's ardour still went on ,</l>
     <l n="46">Until upon the mountain top they stood ,</l>
     <l n="47">And lake by lake was fading in the dusk .</l>
     <l n="48">Out of the plains they saw the moon move up</l>
     <l n="49">And over them the deeper blue came on ,</l>
     <l n="50">The faint stars glowing into mastery .</l>
     <l n="51">And in that splendour of a summer hill ,</l>
     <l n="52">Amid the mellow-breathing night , where yet</l>
     <l n="53">The poppies of the valley could not come ,</l>
     <l n="54">There was conceived a boy ....</l>
     <l n="55">And sorrow came</l>
     <l n="56">Upon their love . Before the moon again</l>
     <l n="57">Was full upon Helvellyn , the Cotswold lover</l>
     <l n="58">With a great elm was blasted in a storm ,</l>
     <l n="59">And lay , a burnt thing , in a Cotswold grave .</l>
     <l n="60">And she went out , took her inheritance ,</l>
     <l n="61">And lived apart , and the man-child was born .</l>
     <l n="62">She called him Lake , for those fading lakes of dusk ,</l>
     <l n="63">And gave him her own name . And twenty years</l>
     <l n="64">She tended him , and died ; and from her substance</l>
     <l n="65">Lake Winter now for fifteen years had kept</l>
     <l n="66">His Sussex acres in fertility .</l>
     <l n="67">Such was the man , so born , so passionately made ,</l>
     <l n="68">So knit of English earth and generations ,</l>
     <l n="69">Who now upon the summer evening watched —</l>
     <l n="70">His manhood full upon his middle years —</l>

     <l n="8">Lit earth in the days when my body was begun .</l>
     <l n="9">And then October with leaves splendid and blown</l>
     <l n="10">She watched with my little body a little grown ,</l>
     <l n="11">And winter fell , and into our being passed</l>
     <l n="12">Firm frost and icy rivers and the blast</l>
     <l n="13">Of winds that on the iron clods of plough</l>
     <l n="14">Beat with an unseen charging . Then the bough</l>
     <l n="15">Of spring came green , and her glad body stirred</l>
     <l n="16">With a son 's wombed leaping , and she heard</l>
     <l n="17">Songs of the air and woods and waterways ,</l>
     <l n="18">And with them singing the coming of my days .</l>
     <l n="19">And nesting time drew on to summer flowers ,</l>
     <l n="20">And me unborn she taught through patient hours .</l>
     <l n="21">Then on that first June day , with spices blown</l>
     <l n="22">Of roses over clover crops unmown ,</l>
     <l n="23">And grey wind-lifted leaves and blossom of bean ,</l>
     <l n="24">She gave her dear white beauty to the keen</l>
     <l n="25">Anguish of women , and brought my body to birth</l>
     <l n="26">Already skilled in the sculptures of the earth .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="27">Then in the days when her breasts nourished me ,</l>
     <l n="28">Daily she walked , that happy girl , to see</l>
     <l n="29">How summer prospered to bring the harvest on ,</l>
     <l n="30">And how the gardens and how the orchards shone</l>
     <l n="31">With scarlet and blue and yellow flowers and fruit ,</l>
     <l n="32">And hear with equal love the lonely flute</l>
     <l n="33">Of legendary satyrs in the wood ,</l>
     <l n="34">Or the still voice of Christ in bachelorhood .</l>
     <l n="35">And she would come I know to me her son</l>
     <l n="36">With lovely secret gossip of journeys done</l>
     <l n="37">In fields where some day my own feet should go .</l>
     <l n="38">It was not gossip in words that I could not know ,</l>
     <l n="39">Mere ease and pleasure for her mother wit ,</l>
     <l n="40">But such as I could feel the joy of it</l>
     <l n="41">Beating about my baby blood and sense ,</l>
     <l n="42">Maternal tending of intelligence</l>
     <l n="43">In the unwhispered rites of bosom and lip ,</l>
     <l n="44">Divinings worded in bodily fellowship .</l>
     <l n="45">And every shape and colour and scent she knew ,</l>
     <l n="46">Were intimations winding , folding , through</l>
     <l n="47">My infancies of flesh and thought , each one</l>
     <l n="48">To find its unblemished record and copy done</l>
     <l n="49">In little moods drawn from the suckling-breast ...</l>
     <l n="50">That now , in manhood , when I find the nest</l>
     <l n="51">Of the chaffinch moulded in the elder tree ,</l>
     <l n="52">And looking on that lichen cup can see</l>
     <l n="53">The images of eternity and space</l>
     <l n="54">Lavished upon a small bird 's dwelling-place :</l>
     <l n="55">Or when from some blue passage of the sky</l>
     <l n="56">I know that also colour can prophesy :</l>
     <l n="57">Or , ghosted on the brushing tides of wheat ,</l>
     <l n="58">The gossip of a Galilean street ,</l>
     <l n="59">So many Sabbaths gone , I hear again ,</l>
     <l n="60">And his hands plucking that immortal grain :</l>
     <l n="61">Or when by spectral ancestries I pass</l>
     <l n="62">Again to Eden , as the orchard grass</l>
     <l n="63">Gives out the scent of mellow apples blown</l>
     <l n="64">From windy boughs — all these , I know , were known</l>
     <l n="65">By that dear mother when the boy to come</l>
     <l n="66">Was the zeal and gospel of her martyrdom .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="67">Then came the time when I could walk with her ,</l>
     <l n="68">We pilgrims of the fields , with everywhere</l>
     <l n="69">Strange leaves , and spreading of earth , and hedgerow themes ,</l>
     <l n="70">And mossy walls , and bubbling of the streams ,</l>
     <l n="71">And the way of clouds , and the full moon to wane ,</l>
     <l n="72">The bird-song in the lilacs after rain ,</l>
     <l n="73">And month by month the coming of the flowers ,</l>
     <l n="74">for me to learn in speech , as had been ours</l>
     <l n="75">Knowledge unspoken while she fashioned me ...</l>
     <l n="76">And then she died ; and I went on to be</l>
     <l n="77">Through lonely boyhood her disciple still ,</l>
     <l n="78">A wanderer by many a Berkshire hill ,</l>
     <l n="79">By water-meadows of the Oxford plain ,</l>
     <l n="80">By the thick oaks of Avon , with the strain</l>
     <l n="81">Of an old yeoman wisdom dreaming on</l>
     <l n="82">New beauty ever following beauty gone ,</l>
     <l n="83">Until I knew my earth and her raiment fair</l>
     <l n="84">In every difference of the seasons ’ wear ,</l>
     <l n="85">Long years her scholar , with learning of her ways</l>
     <l n="86">To slip unleasht all singing into praise</l>
     <l n="87">Should learning yet by some enchantment be</l>
     <l n="88">Bidden to passion 's better husbandry .</l>

     <l n="9">And may the petals of this garland fall</l>
     <l n="10">On every quarrel , and in fragrance bless</l>
     <l n="11">Old friendship ; and a little comfort all</l>
