      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="2">As I stand waiting in the rain</l>
       <l n="3">For the foggy hoot of the London train ,</l>
       <l n="4">Gazing at silent wall and lamp</l>
       <l n="5">And post and rail and platform damp ,</l>
       <l n="6">What is this power that comes to my sight</l>
       <l n="7">That I see a night without the night ,</l>
       <l n="8">That I see them clear , yet look them through ,</l>
       <l n="9">The silvery things and the darkly blue ,</l>
       <l n="10">That the solid wall seems soft as death ,</l>
       <l n="11">A wavering and unanchored wraith ,</l>
       <l n="12">And rails that shine and stones that stream</l>
       <l n="13">Unsubstantial as a dream ?</l>
       <l n="14">What sudden door has opened so ,</l>
       <l n="15">What hand has passed , that I should know</l>
       <l n="16">This moving vision not of trance</l>
       <l n="17">That melts the globe of circumstance ,</l>
       <l n="18">This sight that marks not least or most</l>
       <l n="19">And makes a stone a passing ghost ?</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="20">Is it that a year ago</l>
       <l n="21">I stood upon this self-same spot ;</l>
       <l n="22">Is it that since a year ago</l>
       <l n="23">The place and I have altered not ;</l>
       <l n="24">Is it that I half forgot ,</l>
       <l n="25">A year ago , and all despised</l>
       <l n="26">For a space the things that I had prized :</l>
       <l n="27">The race of life , the glittering show ?</l>
       <l n="28">Is it that now a year has passed</l>
       <l n="29">Of vain pursuit of glittering things ,</l>
       <l n="30">Of fruitless searching , shouting , running ,</l>
       <l n="31">And greedy lies and candour cunning ,</l>
       <l n="32">Here as I stand the year above</l>
       <l n="33">Sudden the heats and the strivings fail</l>
       <l n="34">And fall away , a fluctuant veil ,</l>
       <l n="35">And the fixed familiar stones restore</l>
       <l n="36">The old appearance-buried core ,</l>
       <l n="37">The moveless and essential me ,</l>
       <l n="38">The eternal personality</l>
       <l n="39">Alone enduring first and last ?</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="40">No , this I have known in other ways ,</l>
       <l n="41">In other places , other days .</l>
       <l n="42">Not only here , on this one peak ,</l>
       <l n="43">Do fixity and beauty speak</l>
       <l n="44">Of the delusiveness of change ,</l>
       <l n="45">Of the transparency of form ,</l>
       <l n="46">The bootless stress of minds that range ,</l>
       <l n="47">The awful calm behind the storm .</l>
       <l n="48">In many places , many days ,</l>
       <l n="49">The invaded soul receives the rays</l>
       <l n="50">Of countries she was nurtured in ,</l>
       <l n="51">Speaks in her silent language strange</l>
       <l n="52">To that beyond which is her kin .</l>
       <l n="53">Even in peopled streets at times</l>
       <l n="54">A metaphysic arm is thrust</l>
       <l n="55">Through the partitioning fabric thin ,</l>
       <l n="56">And tears away the darkening pall</l>
       <l n="57">Cast by the bright phenomenal ,</l>
       <l n="58">And clears the obscured spirit 's mirror</l>
       <l n="59">From shadows of deceptive error ,</l>
       <l n="60">And shows the bells and all their ringing ,</l>
       <l n="61">And all the crowds and all their singing ,</l>
       <l n="62">Carillons that are nothing 's chimes</l>
       <l n="63">And dust that is not even dust ....</l>
       <l n="64">But rarely hold I converse thus</l>
       <l n="65">Where shapes are bright and clamorous ,</l>
       <l n="66">More often comes the word divine</l>
       <l n="67">In places motionless and far ;</l>
       <l n="68">Beneath the white peculiar shine</l>
       <l n="69">Of sunless summer afternoons ;</l>
       <l n="70">At eventide on pale lagoons</l>
       <l n="71">Where hangs reflected one pale star ;</l>
       <l n="72">Or deep in the green solitudes</l>
       <l n="73">Of still erect entranced woods .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="74">O , in the woods alone lying ,</l>
       <l n="75">Scarce a bough in the wind sighing ,</l>
       <l n="76">Gaze I long with fervid power</l>
       <l n="77">At leaf and branch and grass and flower ,</l>
       <l n="78">Breathe I breaths of trembling sight</l>
       <l n="79">Shed from great urns of green delight ,</l>
       <l n="80">Take I draughts and drink them up</l>
       <l n="81">Poured from many a stalk and cup .</l>
       <l n="82">Now do I burn for nothing more</l>
       <l n="83">Than thus to gaze , thus to adore</l>
       <l n="84">This exquisiteness of nature ever</l>
       <l n="85">In silence ....</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="86">But with instant light</l>
       <l n="87">Rends the film ; with joy I quiver</l>
       <l n="88">To see with new celestial sight</l>
       <l n="89">Flower and leaf and grass and tree ,</l>
       <l n="90">Doomed barks on an eternal sea ,</l>
       <l n="91">Flit phantom-like as transient smoke .</l>
       <l n="92">Beauty herself her spell has broke ,</l>
       <l n="93">Beauty , the herald and the lure ,</l>
       <l n="94">Her message told , may not endure ;</l>
       <l n="95">Her portal opened , she has died ,</l>
       <l n="96">Supreme immortal suicide .</l>
       <l n="97">Yes , sleepless nature soundless flings</l>
       <l n="98">Invisible grapples round the soul ,</l>
       <l n="99">Drawing her through the web of things</l>
       <l n="100">To the primal end of her journeyings ,</l>
       <l n="101">Her ultimate and constant pole .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="102">For Beauty with her hands that beckon</l>
       <l n="103">Is but the Prophet of a Higher ,</l>
       <l n="104">A flaming and ephemeral beacon ,</l>
       <l n="105">A Phoenix perishing by fire .</l>
       <l n="106">Herself from us herself estranges ,</l>
       <l n="107">Herself her mighty tale doth kill ,</l>
       <l n="108">That all things change yet nothing changes ,</l>
       <l n="109">That all things move yet all are still .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="110">I cannot sink , I cannot climb ,</l>
       <l n="111">Now that I see my ancient dwelling ,</l>
       <l n="112">The central orb untouched of time ,</l>
       <l n="113">And taste a peace all bliss excelling .</l>
       <l n="114">Now I have broken Beauty 's wall ,</l>
       <l n="115">Now that my kindred world I hold ,</l>
       <l n="116">I care not though the cities fall</l>
       <l n="117">And the green earth go cold .</l>

      <head>THE THREE HILLS</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">There were three hills that stood alone</l>
       <l n="2">With woods about their feet .</l>
       <l n="3">They dreamed quiet when the sun shone</l>
       <l n="4">And whispered when the rain beat .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="5">They wore all three their coronals</l>
       <l n="6">Till men with houses came</l>
       <l n="7">And scored their heads with pits and walls</l>
       <l n="8">And thought the hills were tame .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="9">Red and white when day shines bright</l>
       <l n="10">They hide the green for miles ,</l>
       <l n="11">Where are the old hills gone ? At night</l>
       <l n="12">The moon looks down and smiles .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="13">She sees the captors small and weak ,</l>
       <l n="14">She knows the prisoners strong ,</l>
       <l n="15">She hears the patient hills that speak :</l>
       <l n="16">“ Brothers , it is not long ;</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="17">“ Brothers , we stood when they were not</l>
       <l n="18">Ten thousand summers past .</l>
       <l n="19">Brothers , when they are clean forgot</l>
       <l n="20">We shall outlive the last ;</l>

       <l n="21">“ One shall die and one shall flee</l>

      <head>DIALOGUE</head>
      <head>THE ONE</head>
       <l n="1">The dead man 's gone , the live man 's</l>
       <l n="2">sad , the dying leaf shakes on the tree ,</l>
       <l n="3">The wind constrains the window panes and</l>
       <l n="4">moans like moaning of the sea ,</l>
       <l n="5">And sour 's the taste now culled in haste of</l>
       <l n="6">lovely things I won too late ,</l>
       <l n="7">And loud and loud above the crowd the</l>
       <l n="8">Voice of One more strong than we .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>THE OTHER</p>
     <p>This Voice you hear , this call you fear , is it unprophesied or new ? Were you so insolent to think its rope would never circle you ? Did you then beastlike live and walk with ears and eyes that would not turn ? Who bade you hope your service ‘ scape in that eternal retinue ?</p>
     <p>THE ONE</p>
     <p>No ; for I swear now bare 's the tree and loud the moaning of the wind , I walked no rut with eyelids shut , my ears and eyes were never blind , Only my eager thoughts I bent on many things that I desired To make my greedy heart content ere flesh and blood I left behind .</p>
     <p>THE OTHER</p>
     <p>Ignorance , then , was all your fault and filmed eyes that could not know , That half discerned and never learned the temporal way that men must go ; You set the image of the world high for your heart 's idolatry , Though with your lips you called the world a toy , a ghost , a passing show .</p>
     <p>THE ONE</p>
     <p>No , no ; this is not true ; my lips spoke only what my heart believed . Called I the world a toy ; I spoke not echo-like or self-deceived . But that I thought the toy was mine to play with , and the passing show Would sate at least my passing lusts , and did not , therefore am I grieved .</p>
     <p>What did I do that I must bear this lifelong tyranny of my fate , That I must writhe in bonds unsought of accidental love and hate ? Had chance but joined different dice , but once or twice , but once or twice , All lovely things that I desired I should have held before too late .</p>
     <p>Surely I knew that flesh was grass nor valued overmuch the prize , But all the powers of chance conspired to cheat a man both just and wise . Happy I 'd been had I but had my due reward , and not a sword Flaming in diabolic hand between me and my Paradise .</p>
     <p>THE OTHER</p>
     <p>No hooded band of fates did stand your heart 's ambitions to gainsay , No flaming brand in evil hand was ever thrust across your way , Only the things all men must meet , the common attributes of men , That men may flinch to see or , seeing , deny , but avoid them no man may .</p>
     <p>Fall the dice , not once or twice but always , to make the self-same sum ; Chance what may , a life 's a life and to a single goal must come ; Though a man search far and wide , never is hunger satisfied ; Nature brings her natural fetters , man is meshed and the wise are dumb .</p>
     <p>O vain all art to assuage a heart with accents of a mortal tongue , All earthly words are incomplete and only sweet are the songs unsung , Never yet was cause for regret , yet regret must afflict us all , Better it were to grasp the world ‘ thwart which this world is a curtain flung .</p>

       <l n="1">The cord broke , and the tent</l>

       <l n="4">Of the deliberate firmament .</l>
       <l n="5">Yet cared we not ; how should we care ?</l>
       <l n="6">Knowing that labourless now he breathes</l>
       <l n="7">A golden paradisal air</l>
       <l n="8">Where with more certain craft he wreathes</l>
       <l n="9">Bright braids of words more wise and fair</l>
       <l n="10">Than ever his earthly fabrics were ,</l>
       <l n="11">That his unwavering eyes made fresh ,</l>

       <l n="13">What he then darkly guessed behold ,</l>
       <l n="14">And watch with an abiding joy</l>

       <l n="17">Brother , yet great thy power ;</l>
       <l n="18">Thou stood'st as on a tower</l>
       <l n="19">Small ‘ neath the stars yet high above the fields ;</l>
       <l n="20">In thy alembic song</l>
       <l n="21">Imagination strong</l>
       <l n="22">Distilled what essences the quest to mortals yields .</l>
       <l n="23">This thy reward well-won ,</l>
       <l n="24">For every morning 's sun</l>
       <l n="25">Found thy heart 's firm allegiance still unshaken ;</l>
       <l n="26">No temporal ache or smart</l>
       <l n="27">Drave Beauty from thy heart ,</l>

       <l n="29">Yes ; for though stringent was the test ,</l>
       <l n="30">When that thy trial was bitterest ,</l>
       <l n="31">Steadfast thou did'st remain ; unshod</l>
       <l n="32">The harrows of Pain thy feet once trod ,</l>
       <l n="33">Humiliate as thy sad song tells</l>
       <l n="34">Before the vault 's white sentinels .</l>
       <l n="35">Friendless and faint thou sojourned'st there ,</l>
       <l n="36">A bowed , brave , timid wanderer ,</l>
       <l n="37">A lonely nomad of the spirit ,</l>
       <l n="38">Who did a triple curse inherit ,</l>
       <l n="39">Hunger , regret and memory .</l>
       <l n="40">Yet never did they vanquish thee ;</l>
       <l n="41">When nighest broken , most alone ,</l>
       <l n="42">Thy unassuaged thoughts could clamber</l>
       <l n="43">To beauty on her ageless throne ;</l>
       <l n="44">Thou wert as one in torture chamber</l>
       <l n="45">Who sees the blue through an open casement</l>
       <l n="46">And hammers his soul to endure the time</l>
       <l n="47">Of his corporeal abasement ;</l>
       <l n="48">Nor writhed'st at thine or others ’ fault ,</l>
       <l n="49">But with grim tenderness did salt</l>
       <l n="50">Thy cicatrices with a rhyme .</l>
       <l n="51">Not the most sable flame of gloom</l>
       <l n="52">Could penetrate thy inmost room ;</l>
       <l n="53">But through the walls thy spirit sucked</l>
       <l n="54">Into that cloistral hermitage</l>
       <l n="55">Stray lovely things , moonbeams and snows</l>
       <l n="56">The far sky shed into thy cage ,</l>
       <l n="57">And , from the very gutter plucked ,</l>
       <l n="58">A lost and mired campestral rose .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="59">Ended that purgatorial period ,</l>
       <l n="60">Filled was thy wallet and thy feet were shod ,</l>
       <l n="61">The leaden weights were moved , the rack withdrawn ,</l>
       <l n="62">Thou didst traverse the dewy fields of dawn ,</l>
       <l n="63">Watch sunsets blazoning over upland turf ,</l>
       <l n="64">Pull poppies from the frontiers of the surf ,</l>
       <l n="65">Dwelled'st with love and human eyes</l>
       <l n="66">Vigilant , calm and wise .</l>
       <l n="67">But still as when thy bark did ride</l>
       <l n="68">Derelict on the city 's tide ,</l>
       <l n="69">As then for penury now for pride</l>
       <l n="70">Thy bodily senses were denied ;</l>
       <l n="71">Though they cried out and would not sleep ,</l>
       <l n="72">Ascetic thou didst armour them</l>
       <l n="73">Lest acid pleasure should eat thine art 's pure gem .</l>
       <l n="74">Hourly the tempter 's ambuscades</l>
       <l n="75">But thou didst guard the gates and keep</l>
       <l n="76">Thy senses ’ hungry colonnades</l>
       <l n="77">Accessible but to Beauty 's ministers ,</l>
       <l n="78">Unlit by any ruby flame but hers .</l>
       <l n="79">Immuring so thy spirit eager</l>
       <l n="80">Within a body frail and meagre ,</l>
       <l n="81">Far from the meads of earthly milk and honey ,</l>
       <l n="82">Yet franchised of more wondrous territories ,</l>
       <l n="83">Like those poor Bedouin of Arabia the Stony</l>
       <l n="84">Who roam spare-fed and hollow-eyed but free</l>
       <l n="85">By day to wander and by night to camp</l>
       <l n="86">In vast serenity ,</l>
       <l n="87">Compassed by God 's great silent glories</l>
       <l n="88">The sun 's gold splendour and the moon 's white lamp ,</l>
       <l n="89">Folded and safe from harm</l>

       <l n="94">Of fruits of heavenly taste !</l>
       <l n="95">Urania 's fiercest servant ,</l>

       <l n="105">That flushes him who drinks</l>
       <l n="106">Nor shrinks</l>
       <l n="107">The exalted anguish of diurnal draughts</l>
       <l n="108">To a clear vision , more intolerable</l>
       <l n="109">In its blissful pain , than love 's most ardent shafts ,</l>
       <l n="110">Of the seats where she doth dwell ,</l>
       <l n="111">She , whom thou didst confess</l>
       <l n="112">Enticed</l>
       <l n="113">Thee hot to her throne to press</l>
       <l n="114">For the greater glory of Christ</l>

      <head>THE OWLS</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">‘ Neath their black yews in solemn state</l>
       <l n="2">The owls are sitting in a row</l>
       <l n="3">Like foreign gods ; and even so</l>
       <l n="4">Blink their red eyes ; they meditate .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="5">Quite motionless they hold them thus</l>
       <l n="6">Until at last the day is done ,</l>
       <l n="7">And driving down the slanting sun ,</l>
       <l n="8">The sad night is victorious .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="9">They teach the wise who gives them ear</l>
       <l n="10">That in this world he most should fear</l>
       <l n="11">All things which loud or restless be .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="12">Who , dazzled by a passing shade ,</l>
       <l n="13">Follows it , never will be free</l>
       <l n="14">Till the dread penalty be paid .</l>
