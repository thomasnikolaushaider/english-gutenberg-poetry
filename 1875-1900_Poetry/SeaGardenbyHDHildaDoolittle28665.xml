     <head>SEA ROSE</head>
     <p>Rose , harsh rose , marred and with stint of petals , meagre flower , thin , sparse of leaf ,</p>
     <p>more precious than a wet rose single on a stem — you are caught in the drift .</p>
     <p>Stunted , with small leaf , you are flung on the sand , you are lifted in the crisp sand that drives in the wind .</p>
     <p>Can the spice-rose drip such acrid fragrance hardened in a leaf ?</p>

       <l n="1">O be swift —</l>

     </lg>
     <p>We fled inland with our flocks , we pastured them in hollows , cut off from the wind and the salt track of the marsh .</p>
     <p>We worshipped inland — we stepped past wood-flowers , we forgot your tang , we brushed wood-grass .</p>
     <p>We wandered from pine-hills through oak and scrub-oak tangles , we broke hyssop and bramble , we caught flower and new bramble-fruit in our hair : we laughed as each branch whipped back , we tore our feet in half buried rocks and knotted roots and acorn-cups .</p>
     <p>We forgot — we worshipped , we parted green from green , we sought further thickets , we dipped our ankles through leaf-mould and earth , and wood and wood-bank enchanted us —</p>
     <p>and the feel of the clefts in the bark , and the slope between tree and tree — and a slender path strung field to field and wood to wood and hill to hill and the forest after it .</p>
     <p>We forgot — for a moment tree-resin , tree-bark , sweat of a torn branch were sweet to the taste .</p>
     <p>We were enchanted with the fields , the tufts of coarse grass in the shorter grass — we loved all this .</p>
     <p>But now , our boat climbs — hesitates — drops — climbs — hesitates — crawls back — climbs — hesitates — O be swift — we have always known you wanted us .</p>

     <head>THE SHRINE</head>
     <head>( “ SHE WATCHES OVER THE SEA ” )</head>
      <head>I</head>
     <p>Are your rocks shelter for ships — have you sent galleys from your beach , are you graded — a safe crescent — where the tide lifts them back to port — are you full and sweet , tempting the quiet to depart in their trading ships ?</p>
     <p>Nay , you are great , fierce , evil — you are the land-blight — you have tempted men but they perished on your cliffs .</p>
     <p>Your lights are but dank shoals , slate and pebble and wet shells and seaweed fastened to the rocks .</p>
     <p>It was evil — evil when they found you , when the quiet men looked at you — they sought a headland shaded with ledge of cliff from the wind-blast .</p>
     <p>But you — you are unsheltered , cut with the weight of wind — you shudder when it strikes , then lift , swelled with the blast — you sink as the tide sinks , you shrill under hail , and sound thunder when thunder sounds . You are useless — when the tides swirl your boulders cut and wreck the staggering ships .</p>
     <p>II</p>
     <p>You are useless , O grave , O beautiful , the landsmen tell it — I have heard — you are useless .</p>
     <p>And the wind sounds with this and the sea where rollers shot with blue cut under deeper blue .</p>
     <p>O but stay tender , enchanted where wave-lengths cut you apart from all the rest — for we have found you , we watch the splendour of you , we thread throat on throat of freesia for your shelf .</p>
     <p>You are not forgot , O plunder of lilies , honey is not more sweet than the salt stretch of your beach .</p>
     <p>III</p>
     <p>Stay — stay — but terror has caught us now , we passed the men in ships , we dared deeper than the fisher-folk and you strike us with terror O bright shaft .</p>
     <p>Flame passes under us and sparks that unknot the flesh , sorrow , splitting bone from bone , splendour athwart our eyes and rifts in the splendour , sparks and scattered light .</p>
     <p>Many warned of this , men said : there are wrecks on the fore-beach , wind will beat your ship , there is no shelter in that headland , it is useless waste , that edge , that front of rock — sea-gulls clang beyond the breakers , none venture to that spot .</p>
     <p>IV</p>
     <p>But hail — as the tide slackens , as the wind beats out , we hail this shore — we sing to you , spirit between the headlands and the further rocks .</p>
     <p>Though oak-beams split , though boats and sea-men flounder , and the strait grind sand with sand and cut boulders to sand and drift —</p>
     <p>your eyes have pardoned our faults , your hands have touched us — you have leaned forward a little and the waves can never thrust us back from the splendour of your ragged coast .</p>

      <head>MID-DAY</head>
      <head>The light beats upon me . I am startled — a split leaf crackles on the paved floor — I am anguished — defeated .</head>
       <l n="1">A slight wind shakes the seed-pods —</l>
       <l n="2">my thoughts are spent</l>
       <l n="3">as the black seeds .</l>
       <l n="4">My thoughts tear me ,</l>
       <l n="5">I dread their fever .</l>
       <l n="6">I am scattered in its whirl .</l>
       <l n="7">I am scattered like</l>
       <l n="8">the hot shrivelled seeds .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>The shrivelled seeds are spilt on the path — the grass bends with dust , the grape slips under its crackled leaf : yet far beyond the spent seed-pods , and the blackened stalks of mint , the poplar is bright on the hill , the poplar spreads out , deep-rooted among trees .</p>
     <p>O poplar , you are great among the hill-stones , while I perish on the path among the crevices of the rocks .</p>

     <head>PURSUIT</head>
     <p>What do I care that the stream is trampled , the sand on the stream-bank still holds the print of your foot : the heel is cut deep . I see another mark on the grass ridge of the bank — it points toward the wood-path . I have lost the third in the packed earth .</p>
     <p>But here a wild-hyacinth stalk is snapped : the purple buds — half ripe — show deep purple where your heel pressed .</p>
     <p>A patch of flowering grass , low , trailing — you brushed this : the green stems show yellow-green where you lifted — turned the earth-side to the light : this and a dead leaf-spine , split across , show where you passed .</p>
     <p>You were swift , swift ! here the forest ledge slopes — rain has furrowed the roots . Your hand caught at this ; the root snapped under your weight .</p>
     <p>I can almost follow the note where it touched this slender tree and the next answered — and the next .</p>
     <p>And you climbed yet further ! you stopped by the dwarf-cornel — whirled on your heels , doubled on your track .</p>
     <p>This is clear — you fell on the downward slope , you dragged a bruised thigh — you limped — you clutched this larch .</p>
     <p>Did your head , bent back , search further — clear through the green leaf-moss of the larch branches ?</p>
     <p>Did you clutch , stammer with short breath and gasp : wood-daemons grant life — give life — I am almost lost .</p>
     <p>For some wood-daemon has lightened your steps . I can find no trace of you in the larch-cones and the underbrush .</p>

     <head>THE CONTEST</head>
      <head>I</head>
     <p>Your stature is modelled with straight tool-edge : you are chiselled like rocks that are eaten into by the sea .</p>
     <p>With the turn and grasp of your wrist and the chords ’ stretch , there is a glint like worn brass .</p>
     <p>The ridge of your breast is taut , and under each the shadow is sharp , and between the clenched muscles of your slender hips .</p>
     <p>From the circle of your cropped hair there is light , and about your male torse and the foot-arch and the straight ankle .</p>
     <lg type="poem">
      <head>II</head>
      <head>You stand rigid and mighty — granite and the ore in rocks ; a great band clasps your forehead and its heavy twists of gold .</head>
       <l n="1">You are white — a limb of cypress</l>
       <l n="2">bent under a weight of snow .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>You are splendid , your arms are fire ; you have entered the hill-straits — a sea treads upon the hill-slopes .</p>
     <p>III</p>
     <p>Myrtle is about your head , you have bent and caught the spray : each leaf is sharp against the lift and furrow of your bound hair .</p>
     <p>The narcissus has copied the arch of your slight breast : your feet are citron-flowers , your knees , cut from white-ash , your thighs are rock-cistus .</p>
     <p>Your chin lifts straight from the hollow of your curved throat . Your shoulders are level — they have melted rare silver for their breadth .</p>

     <head>SEA LILY</head>
     <p>Reed , slashed and torn but doubly rich — such great heads as yours drift upon temple-steps , but you are shattered in the wind .</p>
     <p>Myrtle-bark is flecked from you , scales are dashed from your stem , sand cuts your petal , furrows it with hard edge , like flint on a bright stone .</p>
     <p>Yet though the whole wind slash at your bark , you are lifted up , aye — though it hiss to cover you with froth .</p>

     <head>THE WIND SLEEPERS</head>
     <p>Whiter than the crust left by the tide , we are stung by the hurled sand and the broken shells .</p>
     <p>We no longer sleep in the wind — we awoke and fled through the city gate .</p>
     <p>Tear — tear us an altar , tug at the cliff-boulders , pile them with the rough stones — we no longer sleep in the wind , propitiate us .</p>
     <p>Chant in a wail that never halts , pace a circle and pay tribute with a song .</p>
     <p>When the roar of a dropped wave breaks into it , pour meted words of sea-hawks and gulls and sea-birds that cry discords .</p>

      <head>THE GIFT</head>
       <l n="1">Instead of pearls — a wrought clasp —</l>
       <l n="2">a bracelet — will you accept this ?</l>
     </lg>
     <p>You know the script — you will start , wonder : what is left , what phrase after last night ? This :</p>
     <p>The world is yet unspoiled for you , you wait , expectant — you are like the children who haunt your own steps for chance bits — a comb that may have slipped , a gold tassel , unravelled , plucked from your scarf , twirled by your slight fingers into the street — a flower dropped .</p>
     <p>Do not think me unaware , I who have snatched at you as the street-child clutched at the seed-pearls you spilt that hot day when your necklace snapped .</p>
     <p>Do not dream that I speak as one defrauded of delight , sick , shaken by each heart-beat or paralyzed , stretched at length , who gasps : these ripe pears are bitter to the taste , this spiced wine , poison , corrupt . I cannot walk — who would walk ? Life is a scavenger 's pit — I escape — I only , rejecting it , lying here on this couch .</p>
     <p>Your garden sloped to the beach , myrtle overran the paths , honey and amber flecked each leaf , the citron-lily head — one among many — weighed there , over-sweet .</p>
     <p>The myrrh-hyacinth spread across low slopes , violets streaked black ridges through the grass .</p>
     <p>The house , too , was like this , over painted , over lovely — the world is like this .</p>
     <p>Sleepless nights , I remember the initiates , their gesture , their calm glance . I have heard how in rapt thought , in vision , they speak with another race , more beautiful , more intense than this . I could laugh — more beautiful , more intense ?</p>
     <p>Perhaps that other life is contrast always to this . I reason : I have lived as they in their inmost rites — they endure the tense nerves through the moment of ritual . I endure from moment to moment — days pass all alike , tortured , intense .</p>
     <p>This I forgot last night : you must not be blamed , it is not your fault ; as a child , a flower — any flower tore my breast — meadow-chicory , a common grass-tip , a leaf shadow , a flower tint unexpected on a winter-branch .</p>
     <p>I reason : another life holds what this lacks , a sea , unmoving , quiet — not forcing our strength to rise to it , beat on beat — stretch of sand , no garden beyond , strangling with its myrrh-lilies — a hill , not set with black violets but stones , stones , bare rocks , dwarf-trees , twisted , no beauty to distract — to crowd madness upon madness .</p>
     <p>Only a still place and perhaps some outer horror some hideousness to stamp beauty , a mark — no changing it now — on our hearts .</p>
     <p>I send no string of pearls , no bracelet — accept this .</p>

     <head>EVENING</head>
     <p>The light passes from ridge to ridge , from flower to flower — the hypaticas , wide-spread under the light grow faint — the petals reach inward , the blue tips bend toward the bluer heart and the flowers are lost .</p>
     <p>The cornel-buds are still white , but shadows dart from the cornel-roots — black creeps from root to root , each leaf cuts another leaf on the grass , shadow seeks shadow , then both leaf and leaf-shadow are lost .</p>

      <head>SHELTERED GARDEN</head>
       <l n="1">I have had enough .</l>
       <l n="2">I gasp for breath .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>Every way ends , every road , every foot-path leads at last to the hill-crest — then you retrace your steps , or find the same slope on the other side , precipitate .</p>
     <p>I have had enough — border-pinks , clove-pinks , wax-lilies , herbs , sweet-cress .</p>
     <p>O for some sharp swish of a branch — there is no scent of resin in this place , no taste of bark , of coarse weeds , aromatic , astringent — only border on border of scented pinks .</p>
     <p>Have you seen fruit under cover that wanted light — pears wadded in cloth , protected from the frost , melons , almost ripe , smothered in straw ?</p>
     <p>Why not let the pears cling to the empty branch ? All your coaxing will only make a bitter fruit — let them cling , ripen of themselves , test their own worth , nipped , shrivelled by the frost , to fall at last but fair with a russet coat .</p>
     <p>Or the melon — let it bleach yellow in the winter light , even tart to the taste — it is better to taste of frost — the exquisite frost — than of wadding and of dead grass .</p>
     <p>For this beauty , beauty without strength , chokes out life . I want wind to break , scatter these pink-stalks , snap off their spiced heads , fling them about with dead leaves — spread the paths with twigs , limbs broken off , trail great pine branches , hurled from some far wood right across the melon-patch , break pear and quince — leave half-trees , torn , twisted but showing the fight was valiant .</p>
     <p>O to blot out this garden to forget , to find a new beauty in some terrible wind-tortured place .</p>

     <head>LOSS</head>
     <p>The sea called — you faced the estuary , you were drowned as the tide passed .— I am glad of this — at least you have escaped .</p>
     <p>The heavy sea-mist stifles me . I choke with each breath — a curious peril , this — the gods have invented curious torture for us .</p>
     <p>One of us , pierced in the flank , dragged himself across the marsh , he tore at the bay-roots , lost hold on the crumbling bank —</p>
     <p>Another crawled — too late — for shelter under the cliffs .</p>
     <p>I am glad the tide swept you out , O beloved , you of all this ghastly host alone untouched , your white flesh covered with salt as with myrrh and burnt iris .</p>
     <p>We were hemmed in this place , so few of us , so few of us to fight their sure lances , the straight thrust — effortless with slight life of muscle and shoulder .</p>
     <p>So straight — only we were left , the four of us — somehow shut off .</p>
     <p>And the marsh dragged one back , and another perished under the cliff , and the tide swept you out .</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">Your feet cut steel on the paths ,</l>
       <l n="2">I followed for the strength</l>
       <l n="3">of life and grasp .</l>
       <l n="4">I have seen beautiful feet</l>
       <l n="5">but never beauty welded with strength .</l>
       <l n="6">I marvelled at your height .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>You stood almost level with the lance-bearers and so slight .</p>
     <p>And I wondered as you clasped your shoulder-strap at the strength of your wrist and the turn of your young fingers , and the lift of your shorn locks , and the bronze of your sun-burnt neck .</p>
     <p>All of this , and the curious knee-cap , fitted above the wrought greaves , and the sharp muscles of your back which the tunic could not cover — the outline no garment could deface .</p>
     <p>I wonder if you knew how I watched , how I crowded before the spearsmen — but the gods wanted you , the gods wanted you back .</p>

     <head>HUNTRESS</head>
     <p>Come , blunt your spear with us , our pace is hot and our bare heels in the heel-prints — we stand tense — do you see — are you already beaten by the chase ?</p>
     <p>We lead the pace for the wind on the hills , the low hill is spattered with loose earth — our feet cut into the crust as with spears .</p>
     <p>We climbed the ploughed land , dragged the seed from the clefts , broke the clods with our heels , whirled with a parched cry into the woods :</p>
     <p>Can you come , can you come , can you follow the hound trail , can you trample the hot froth ?</p>
     <p>Spring up — sway forward — follow the quickest one , aye , though you leave the trail and drop exhausted at our feet .</p>

     <p>Fruit cannot drop through this thick air — fruit cannot fall into heat that presses up and blunts the points of pears and rounds the grapes .</p>
     <p>Cut the heat — plough through it , turning it on either side of your path .</p>

     <head>SEA VIOLET</head>
     <p>The white violet is scented on its stalk , the sea-violet fragile as agate , lies fronting all the wind among the torn shells on the sand-bank .</p>
     <p>The greater blue violets flutter on the hill , but who would change for these who would change for these one root of the white sort ?</p>
     <p>Violet your grasp is frail on the edge of the sand-hill , but you catch the light — frost , a star edges with its fire .</p>

     <head>THE CLIFF TEMPLE</head>
      <head>I</head>
     <p>Great , bright portal , shelf of rock , rocks fitted in long ledges , rocks fitted to dark , to silver granite , to lighter rock — clean cut , white against white .</p>
     <p>High — high — and no hill-goat tramples — no mountain-sheep has set foot on your fine grass ; you lift , you are the world-edge , pillar for the sky-arch .</p>
     <p>The world heaved — we are next to the sky : over us , sea-hawks shout , gulls sweep past — the terrible breakers are silent from this place .</p>
     <p>Below us , on the rock-edge , where earth is caught in the fissures of the jagged cliff , a small tree stiffens in the gale , it bends — but its white flowers are fragrant at this height .</p>
     <p>And under and under , the wind booms : it whistles , it thunders , it growls — it presses the grass beneath its great feet .</p>
     <p>II</p>
     <p>I said : for ever and for ever , must I follow you through the stones ? I catch at you — you lurch : you are quicker than my hand-grasp .</p>
     <p>I wondered at you . I shouted — dear — mysterious — beautiful — white myrtle-flesh .</p>
     <p>I was splintered and torn : the hill-path mounted swifter than my feet .</p>
     <p>Could a daemon avenge this hurt , I would cry to him — could a ghost , I would shout — O evil , follow this god , taunt him with his evil and his vice .</p>

      <head>Shall I hurl myself from here , shall I leap and be nearer you ? Shall I drop , beloved , beloved , ankle against ankle ? Would you pity me , O white breast ?</head>
       <l n="1">If I woke , would you pity me ,</l>
       <l n="2">would our eyes meet ?</l>
     </lg>
     <p>Have you heard , do you know how I climbed this rock ? My breath caught , I lurched forward — stumbled in the ground-myrtle .</p>
     <p>Have you heard , O god seated on the cliff , how far toward the ledges of your house , how far I had to walk ?</p>
     <p>IV</p>
     <p>Over me the wind swirls . I have stood on your portal and I know — you are further than this , still further on another cliff .</p>

     <head>ORCHARD</head>
     <p>I saw the first pear as it fell — the honey-seeking , golden-banded , the yellow swarm was not more fleet than I , ( spare us from loveliness ) and I fell prostrate crying : you have flayed us with your blossoms , spare us the beauty of fruit-trees .</p>
     <p>The honey-seeking paused not , the air thundered their song , and I alone was prostrate .</p>
     <p>O rough-hewn god of the orchard , I bring you an offering — do you , alone unbeautiful , son of the god , spare us from loveliness :</p>
     <p>these fallen hazel-nuts , stripped late of their green sheaths , grapes , red-purple , their berries dripping with wine , pomegranates already broken , and shrunken figs and quinces untouched , I bring you as offering .</p>

     <head>SEA GODS</head>
      <head>I</head>
     <p>They say there is no hope — sand — drift — rocks — rubble of the sea — the broken hulk of a ship , hung with shreds of rope , pallid under the cracked pitch .</p>
     <p>They say there is no hope to conjure you — no whip of the tongue to anger you — no hate of words you must rise to refute .</p>
     <p>They say you are twisted by the sea , you are cut apart by wave-break upon wave-break , that you are misshapen by the sharp rocks , broken by the rasp and after-rasp .</p>
     <p>That you are cut , torn , mangled , torn by the stress and beat , no stronger than the strips of sand along your ragged beach .</p>
     <p>II</p>
     <p>But we bring violets , great masses — single , sweet , wood-violets , stream-violets , violets from a wet marsh .</p>
     <p>Violets in clumps from hills , tufts with earth at the roots , violets tugged from rocks , blue violets , moss , cliff , river-violets .</p>
     <p>Yellow violets ’ gold , burnt with a rare tint — violets like red ash among tufts of grass .</p>
     <p>We bring deep-purple bird-foot violets .</p>
     <p>We bring the hyacinth-violet , sweet , bare , chill to the touch — and violets whiter than the in-rush of your own white surf .</p>
     <p>III</p>
     <p>For you will come , you will yet haunt men in ships , you will trail across the fringe of strait and circle the jagged rocks .</p>
     <p>You will trail across the rocks and wash them with your salt , you will curl between sand-hills — you will thunder along the cliff — break — retreat — get fresh strength — gather and pour weight upon the beach .</p>
     <p>You will draw back , and the ripple on the sand-shelf will be witness of your track . O privet-white , you will paint the lintel of wet sand with froth .</p>
     <p>You will bring myrrh-bark and drift laurel-wood from hot coasts ! when you hurl high — high — we will answer with a shout .</p>
     <p>For you will come , you will come , you will answer our taut hearts , you will break the lie of men 's thoughts , and cherish and shelter us .</p>

     <p>Bear me to Dictaeus , and to the steep slopes ; to the river Erymanthus .</p>
     <p>I choose spray of dittany , cyperum , frail of flower , buds of myrrh , all-healing herbs , close pressed in calathes .</p>
     <p>For she lies panting , drawing sharp breath , broken with harsh sobs , she , Hyella , whom no god pities .</p>
      <p>II</p>
     <p>Dryads haunting the groves , nereids who dwell in wet caves , for all the white leaves of olive-branch , and early roses , and ivy wreaths , woven gold berries , which she once brought to your altars , bear now ripe fruits from Arcadia , and Assyrian wine to shatter her fever .</p>
     <p>The light of her face falls from its flower , as a hyacinth , hidden in a far valley , perishes upon burnt grass .</p>
     <p>Pales , bring gifts , bring your Phoenician stuffs , and do you , fleet-footed nymphs , bring offerings , Illyrian iris , and a branch of shrub , and frail-headed poppies .</p>

     <head>NIGHT</head>
     <p>The night has cut each from each and curled the petals back from the stalk and under it in crisp rows ;</p>
     <p>under at an unfaltering pace , under till the rinds break , back till each bent leaf is parted from its stalk ;</p>
     <p>under at a grave pace , under till the leaves are bent back till they drop upon earth , back till they are all broken .</p>
     <p>O night , you take the petals of the roses in your hand , but leave the stark core of the rose to perish on the branch .</p>

     <head>PRISONERS</head>
     <p>It is strange that I should want this sight of your face — we have had so much : at any moment now I may pass , stand near the gate , do not speak — only reach if you can , your face half-fronting the passage toward the light .</p>
     <p>Fate — God sends this as a mark , a last token that we are not forgot , lost in this turmoil , about to be crushed out , burned or stamped out at best with sudden death .</p>
     <p>The spearsman who brings this will ask for the gold clasp you wear under your coat . I gave all I had left .</p>
     <p>Press close to the portal , my gate will soon clang and your fellow wretches will crowd to the entrance — be first at the gate .</p>
     <p>Ah beloved , do not speak . I write this in great haste — do not speak , you may yet be released . I am glad enough to depart though I have never tasted life as in these last weeks .</p>
     <p>It is a strange life , patterned in fire and letters on the prison pavement . If I glance up it is written on the walls , it is cut on the floor , it is patterned across the slope of the roof .</p>
     <p>I am weak — weak — last night if the guard had left the gate unlocked I could not have ventured to escape , but one thought serves me now with strength .</p>
     <p>As I pass down the corridor past desperate faces at each cell , your eyes and my eyes may meet .</p>
     <p>You will be dark , unkempt , but I pray for one glimpse of your face — why do I want this ? I who have seen you at the banquet each flower of your hyacinth-circlet white against your hair .</p>
     <p>Why do I want this , when even last night you startled me from sleep ? You stood against the dark rock , you grasped an elder staff .</p>
     <p>So many nights you have distracted me from terror . Once you lifted a spear-flower . I remember how you stooped to gather it — and it flamed , the leaf and shoot and the threads , yellow , yellow — sheer till they burnt to red-purple in the cup .</p>
     <p>As I pass your cell-door do not speak . I was first on the list — They may forget you tried to shield me as the horsemen passed .</p>

     <head>STORM</head>
     <p>You crash over the trees , you crack the live branch — the branch is white , the green crushed , each leaf is rent like split wood .</p>
     <p>You burden the trees with black drops , you swirl and crash — you have broken off a weighted leaf in the wind , it is hurled out , whirls up and sinks , a green stone .</p>

     <p>Weed , moss-weed , root tangled in sand , sea-iris , brittle flower , one petal like a shell is broken , and you print a shadow like a thin twig .</p>
     <p>Fortunate one , scented and stinging , rigid myrrh-bud , camphor-flower , sweet and salt — you are wind in our nostrils .</p>
      <p>II</p>
     <p>Do the murex-fishers drench you as they pass ? Do your roots drag up colour from the sand ? Have they slipped gold under you — rivets of gold ?</p>
     <p>Band of iris-flowers above the waves , you are painted blue , painted like a fresh prow stained among the salt weeds .</p>

     <head>HERMES OF THE WAYS</head>
     <p>The hard sand breaks , and the grains of it are clear as wine .</p>
     <p>Far off over the leagues of it , the wind , playing on the wide shore , piles little ridges , and the great waves break over it .</p>
     <p>But more than the many-foamed ways of the sea , I know him of the triple path-ways , Hermes , who awaits .</p>
     <p>Dubious , facing three ways , welcoming wayfarers , he whom the sea-orchard shelters from the west , from the east weathers sea-wind ; fronts the great dunes .</p>
     <p>Wind rushes over the dunes , and the coarse , salt-crusted grass answers .</p>
     <p>Heu , it whips round my ankles !</p>
     <p>II</p>
     <p>Small is this white stream , flowing below ground from the poplar-shaded hill , but the water is sweet .</p>
     <p>Apples on the small trees are hard , too small , too late ripened by a desperate sun that struggles through sea-mist .</p>
     <p>The boughs of the trees are twisted by many bafflings ; twisted are the small-leafed boughs .</p>
     <p>But the shadow of them is not the shadow of the mast head nor of the torn sails .</p>
     <p>Hermes , Hermes , the great sea foamed , gnashed its teeth about me ; but you have waited , were sea-grass tangles with shore-grass .</p>

     <p>Silver dust lifted from the earth , higher than my arms reach , you have mounted , O silver , higher than my arms reach you front us with great mass ;</p>
     <p>no flower ever opened so staunch a white leaf , no flower ever parted silver from such rare silver ;</p>
     <p>O white pear , your flower-tufts thick on the branch bring summer and ripe fruits in their purple hearts .</p>

     <head>CITIES</head>
     <p>Can we believe — by an effort comfort our hearts : it is not waste all this , not placed here in disgust , street after street , each patterned alike , no grace to lighten a single house of the hundred crowded into one garden-space .</p>
     <p>Crowded — can we believe , not in utter disgust , in ironical play — but the maker of cities grew faint with the beauty of temple and space before temple , arch upon perfect arch , of pillars and corridors that led out to strange court-yards and porches where sun-light stamped hyacinth-shadows black on the pavement .</p>
     <p>That the maker of cities grew faint with the splendour of palaces , paused while the incense-flowers from the incense-trees dropped on the marble-walk , thought anew , fashioned this — street after street alike .</p>
     <p>For alas , he had crowded the city so full that men could not grasp beauty , beauty was over them , through them , about them , no crevice unpacked with the honey , rare , measureless .</p>
     <p>So he built a new city , ah can we believe , not ironically but for new splendour constructed new people to lift through slow growth to a beauty unrivalled yet — and created new cells , hideous first , hideous now — spread larve across them , not honey but seething life .</p>
     <p>And in these dark cells , packed street after street , souls live , hideous yet — O disfigured , defaced , with no trace of the beauty men once held so light .</p>
     <p>Can we think a few old cells were left — we are left — grains of honey , old dust of stray pollen dull on our torn wings , we are left to recall the old streets ?</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">Is our task the less sweet</l>
       <l n="2">that the larve still sleep in their cells ?</l>
       <l n="3">Or crawl out to attack our frail strength :</l>
       <l n="4">You are useless . We live .</l>
       <l n="5">We await great events .</l>
       <l n="6">We are spread through this earth .</l>
       <l n="7">We protect our strong race .</l>
       <l n="8">You are useless .</l>
       <l n="9">Your cell takes the place</l>
       <l n="10">of our young future strength .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>Though they sleep or wake to torment and wish to displace our old cells — thin rare gold — that their larve grow fat — is our task the less sweet ?</p>
     <p>Though we wander about , find no honey of flowers in this waste , is our task the less sweet — who recall the old splendour , await the new beauty of cities ?</p>
     <p>The city is peopled with spirits , not ghosts , O my love :</p>
     <p>Though they crowded between and usurped the kiss of my mouth their breath was your gift , their beauty , your life .</p>
