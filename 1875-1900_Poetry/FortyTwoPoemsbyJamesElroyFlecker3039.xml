       <l n="9">But have you wine and music still ,</l>

      <head>THE TOWN WITHOUT A MARKET</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">There lies afar behind a western hill</l>
       <l n="2">The Town without a Market , white and still ;</l>
       <l n="3">For six feet long and not a third as high</l>
       <l n="4">Are those small habitations . There stood I ,</l>
       <l n="5">Waiting to hear the citizens beneath</l>
       <l n="6">Murmur and sigh and speak through tongueless teeth .</l>
       <l n="7">When all the world lay burning in the sun</l>
       <l n="8">I heard their voices speak to me . Said one :</l>
       <l n="9">“ Bright lights I loved and colours , I who find</l>
       <l n="10">That death is darkness , and has struck me blind . ”</l>
       <l n="11">Another cried : “ I used to sing and play ,</l>
       <l n="12">But here the world is silent , day by day . ”</l>
       <l n="13">And one : “ On earth I could not see or hear ,</l>
       <l n="14">But with my fingers touched what I was near ,</l>
       <l n="15">And knew things round and soft , and brass from gold ,</l>
       <l n="16">And dipped my hand in water , to feel cold ,</l>
       <l n="17">And thought the grave would cure me , and was glad</l>
       <l n="18">When the time came to lose what joy I had . ”</l>
       <l n="19">Soon all the voices of a hundred dead</l>
       <l n="20">Shouted in wrath together . Someone said ,</l>
       <l n="21">“ I care not , but the girl was sweet to kiss</l>
       <l n="22">At evening in the meadows . ” “ Hard it is ”</l>
       <l n="23">Another cried , “ to hear no hunting horn .</l>
       <l n="24">Ah me ! the horse , the hounds , and the great grey morn</l>
       <l n="25">When I rode out a-hunting . ” And one sighed ,</l>
       <l n="26">“ I did not see my son before I died . ”</l>
       <l n="27">A boy said , “ I was strong and swift to run :</l>
       <l n="28">Now they have tied my feet : what have I done ? ”</l>
       <l n="29">A man , “ But it was good to arm and fight</l>
       <l n="30">And storm their cities in the dead of night . ”</l>
       <l n="31">An old man said , “ I read my books all day ,</l>
       <l n="32">But death has taken all my books away . ”</l>
       <l n="33">And one , “ The popes and prophets did not well</l>
       <l n="34">To cheat poor dead men with false hopes of hell .</l>
       <l n="35">Better the whips of fire that hiss and rend</l>
       <l n="36">Than painless void proceeding to no end . ”</l>
       <l n="37">I smiled to hear them restless , I who sought</l>
       <l n="38">Peace . For I had not loved , I had not fought ,</l>
       <l n="39">And books are vanities , and manly strength</l>
       <l n="40">A gathered flower . God grant us peace at length !</l>
       <l n="41">I heard no more , and turned to leave their town</l>
       <l n="42">Before the chill came , and the sun went down .</l>
       <l n="43">Then rose a whisper , and I seemed to know</l>
       <l n="44">A timorous man , buried long years ago .</l>
       <l n="45">“ On Earth I used to shape the Thing that seems .</l>
       <l n="46">Master of all men , give me back my dreams .</l>
       <l n="47">Give me that world that never failed me then ,</l>
       <l n="48">The hills I made and peopled with tall men ,</l>
       <l n="49">The palace that I built and called my home ,</l>
       <l n="50">My cities which could break the pride of Rome ,</l>
       <l n="51">The three queens hidden in the sacred tree ,</l>
       <l n="52">And those white cloudy folk who sang to me .</l>
       <l n="53">O death , why hast thou covered me so deep ?</l>
       <l n="54">I was thy sister 's child , the friend of Sleep . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="55">Then said my heart , Death takes and cannot give .</l>
       <l n="56">Dark with no dream is hateful : let me live !</l>

       <l n="17">When I was ill and she was pale</l>

       <l n="21">Perhaps she cast herself away</l>

       <l n="33">I dream she dwells in London still</l>
