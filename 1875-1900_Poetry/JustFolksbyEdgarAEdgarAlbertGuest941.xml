     <l n="9">An ’ who had light attacks , an ’ all</l>
     <l n="10">The things that int'rest , big or small ;</l>
     <l n="11">But here you 'll never hear of sinnin ’</l>
     <l n="12">Or any scandal that 's beginnin ’ .</l>
     <l n="13">We 've got too many other labors</l>
     <l n="14">To scatter tales that harm our neighbors .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="15">We 're strange folks here .</l>
     <l n="16">We 're tryin ’ to be cheerful ,</l>
     <l n="17">An ’ keep this home from gettin ’ tearful .</l>
     <l n="18">We hold it dear</l>
     <l n="19">Too dear for pettiness an ’ meanness ,</l>
     <l n="20">An ’ nasty tales of men 's uncleanness .</l>
     <l n="21">Here you shall come to joyous smilin ’ ,</l>
     <l n="22">Secure from hate an ’ harsh revilin ’ ;</l>
     <l n="23">Here , where the wood fire brightly blazes ,</l>
     <l n="24">You 'll hear from us our neighbor 's praises .</l>
     <l n="25">Here , that they 'll never grow to doubt us ,</l>

     <l n="33">An ’ though they dwell in many places ,</l>
     <l n="34">We think we 're talkin ’ to their faces ;</l>
     <l n="35">An ’ that keeps us from only seein ’</l>
     <l n="36">The faults in any human bein ’ ,</l>
     <l n="37">An ’ checks our tongues when they 'd go trailin ’</l>
     <l n="38">Into the mire of mortal failin ’ .</l>
     <l n="39">Flaws are n't so big when folks are near you ;</l>
     <l n="40">You do n't talk mean when they can hear you .</l>
     <l n="41">An ’ so no scandal here is started ,</l>

     <l n="43">As It Goes</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="44">In the corner she 's left the mechanical toy ,</l>
     <l n="45">On the chair is her Teddy Bear fine ;</l>
     <l n="46">The things that I thought she would really enjoy</l>
     <l n="47">Do n't seem to be quite in her line .</l>
     <l n="48">There 's the flaxen-haired doll that is lovely to see</l>
     <l n="49">And really expensively dressed ,</l>
     <l n="50">Left alone , all uncared for , and strange though it be ,</l>
     <l n="51">She likes her rag dolly the best .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="52">Oh , the money we spent and the plans that we laid</l>
     <l n="53">And the wonderful things that we bought !</l>
     <l n="54">There are toys that are cunningly , skillfully made ,</l>
     <l n="55">But she seems not to give them a thought .</l>
     <l n="56">She was pleased when she woke and discovered them there ,</l>
     <l n="57">But never a one of us guessed</l>
     <l n="58">That it is n't the splendor that makes a gift rare —</l>
     <l n="59">She likes her rag dolly the best .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="60">There 's the flaxen-haired doll , with the real human hair ,</l>
     <l n="61">There 's the Teddy Bear left all alone ,</l>
     <l n="62">There 's the automobile at the foot of the stair ,</l>
     <l n="63">And there is her toy telephone ;</l>
     <l n="64">We thought they were fine , but a little child 's eyes</l>
     <l n="65">Look deeper than ours to find charm ,</l>
     <l n="66">And now she 's in bed , and the rag dolly lies</l>
     <l n="67">Snuggled close on her little white arm .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="68">Hollyhocks</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="69">Old-fashioned flowers ! I love them all :</l>
     <l n="70">The morning-glories on the wall ,</l>
     <l n="71">The pansies in their patch of shade ,</l>
     <l n="72">The violets , stolen from a glade ,</l>
     <l n="73">The bleeding hearts and columbine ,</l>
     <l n="74">Have long been garden friends of mine ;</l>
     <l n="75">But memory every summer flocks</l>
     <l n="76">About a clump of hollyhocks .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="77">The mother loved them years ago ;</l>
     <l n="78">Beside the fence they used to grow ,</l>
     <l n="79">And though the garden changed each year</l>
     <l n="80">And certain blooms would disappear</l>
     <l n="81">To give their places in the ground</l>
     <l n="82">To something new that mother found ,</l>
     <l n="83">Some pretty bloom or rosebush rare —</l>
     <l n="84">The hollyhocks were always there .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="85">It seems but yesterday to me</l>
     <l n="86">She led me down the yard to see</l>
     <l n="87">The first tall spires , with bloom aflame ,</l>
     <l n="88">And taught me to pronounce their name .</l>
     <l n="89">And year by year I watched them grow ,</l>
     <l n="90">The first flowers I had come to know .</l>
     <l n="91">And with the mother dear I 'd yearn</l>
     <l n="92">To see the hollyhocks return .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="93">The garden of my boyhood days</l>
     <l n="94">With hollyhocks was kept ablaze ;</l>
     <l n="95">In all my recollections they</l>
     <l n="96">In friendly columns nod and sway ;</l>
     <l n="97">And when to-day their blooms I see ,</l>
     <l n="98">Always the mother smiles at me ;</l>
     <l n="99">The mind 's bright chambers , life unlocks</l>
     <l n="100">Each summer with the hollyhocks .</l>

     <l n="104">When he has more than he can spend</l>

     <l n="108">He 'll win few praises from his Lord</l>
     <l n="109">Who does but what he can afford .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="110">The widow 's mite to heaven went</l>

     <l n="115">I 'm not worrying greatly lest</l>
     <l n="116">The world wo n't hear my story .</l>
     <l n="117">A chance to dream beside a stream</l>
     <l n="118">Where fish are biting free ;</l>
     <l n="119">A day or two , ‘ neath skies of blue ,</l>
     <l n="120">Is joy enough for me .</l>

     <l n="121">I do not ask a hoard of gold ,</l>

     <l n="124">I only want a share .</l>
     <l n="125">Just now and then , away from men</l>
     <l n="126">And all their haunts of pride ,</l>
     <l n="127">If I can steal , with rod and reel ,</l>
     <l n="128">I will be satisfied .</l>

     <l n="129">I 'll gladly work my way through life ;</l>

     <l n="132">For an occasional day .</l>
     <l n="133">If I can sneak from toil a week</l>
     <l n="134">To chum with stream and tree ,</l>
     <l n="135">I 'll fish away and smiling say</l>

     <l n="138">When you 're up against a trouble ,</l>

     <l n="204">The bright spots in my life are when the servant quits the place ,</l>
     <l n="205">Although that grim disturbance brings a frown to Nellie 's face ;</l>
     <l n="206">The week between the old girl 's ’ reign and entry of the new</l>
     <l n="207">Is one that 's filled with happiness and comfort through and through .</l>
     <l n="208">The charm of living 's back again — a charm that servants rob —</l>
     <l n="209">I like the home , I like the meals , when Nellie 's on the job .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="35">
     <l n="210">There 's something in a servant 's ways , however fine they be ,</l>
     <l n="211">That has a cold and distant touch and frets the soul of me .</l>
     <l n="212">The old home never looks so well , as in that week or two</l>
     <l n="213">That we are servantless and Nell has all the work to do .</l>
     <l n="214">There is a sense of comfort then that makes my pulses throb</l>
     <l n="215">And home is as it ought to be when Nellie 's on the job .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="36">
     <l n="216">Think not that I 'd deny her help or grudge the servant 's pay ;</l>
     <l n="217">When one departs we try to get another right away ;</l>
     <l n="218">I merely state the simple fact that no such joys I 've known</l>
     <l n="219">As in those few brief days at home when we 've been left alone .</l>
     <l n="220">There is a gentleness that seems to soothe this selfish elf</l>
     <l n="221">And , Oh , I like to eat those meals that Nellie gets herself !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="37">
     <l n="222">You cannot buy the gentle touch that mother gives the place ;</l>
     <l n="223">No servant girl can do the work with just the proper grace .</l>
     <l n="224">And though you hired the queen of cooks to fashion your croquettes ,</l>
     <l n="225">Her meals would not compare with those your loving comrade gets ;</l>
     <l n="226">So , though the maid has quit again , and she is moved to sob ,</l>
     <l n="227">The old home 's at its finest now , for Nellie 's on the job .</l>

     <l n="229">I have no wish to rail at fate ,</l>
     <l n="230">And vow that I 'm unfairly treated ;</l>

     <l n="233">Life has its ups and downs , I know ,</l>
     <l n="234">But tell me why should people say</l>
     <l n="235">Whenever after fish I go :</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="40">
     <l n="237">It is my luck always to strike</l>
