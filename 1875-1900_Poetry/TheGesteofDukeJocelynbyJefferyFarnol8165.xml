     <l n="5">For whom to-day and yesterday lie far apart</l>
     <l n="6">Already thou , my dear , dost longer dresses wear</l>
     <l n="7">And bobbest in most strange , new-fangled ways thy hair ;</l>
     <l n="8">Thou lookest on the world with eyes grown serious</l>
     <l n="9">And rul'st thy father with a sway imperious</l>
     <l n="10">Particularly as regards his socks and ties</l>
     <l n="11">Insistent that each with the other harmonise .</l>
     <l n="12">Instead of simple fairy-tales that pleased of yore</l>
     <l n="13">Romantic verse thou read'st and novels by the score</l>
     <l n="14">And very oft I 've known thee sigh and call them “ stuff ”</l>
     <l n="15">Vowing of love romantic they 've not half enough .</l>
     <l n="16">Wherefore , like fond and doting parent , I</l>
     <l n="17">Will strive this want romantic to supply .</l>
     <l n="18">I 'll write for thee a book of sighing lover</l>
     <l n="19">Crammed with ROMANCE from cover unto cover ;</l>
     <l n="20">A book the like of which ‘ t were hard to find</l>
     <l n="21">Filled with ROMANCE of every sort and kind .</l>
     <l n="22">I 'll write it as the Gestours wrote of old ,</l>
     <l n="23">In prose , blank-verse , and rhyme it shall be told .</l>
     <l n="24">And GILLIAN —</l>
     <l n="25">Some day perhaps , my dear , when you are grown</l>
     <l n="26">A portly dame with children of your own</l>
     <l n="27">You 'll gather all your troop about your knee</l>
     <l n="28">And read to them this Geste I made for thee .</l>

     <l n="1">Long , long ago when castles grim did frown ,</l>
     <l n="2">When massy wall and gate did ‘ fend each town ;</l>
     <l n="3">When mighty lords in armour bright were seen ,</l>
     <l n="4">And stealthy outlaws lurked amid the green</l>
     <l n="5">And oft were hanged for poaching of the deer ,</l>
     <l n="6">Or , gasping , died upon a hunting spear ;</l>
     <l n="7">When barons bold did on their rights insist</l>
     <l n="8">And hanged or burned all rogues who dared resist ;</l>
     <l n="9">When humble folk on life had no freehold</l>
     <l n="10">And were in open market bought and sold ;</l>
     <l n="11">When grisly witches ( lean and bony hags )</l>
     <l n="12">Cast spells most dire yet , meantime , starved in rags ;</l>
     <l n="13">When kings did lightly a-crusading fare</l>
     <l n="14">And left their kingdoms to the devil 's care —</l>
     <l n="15">At such a time there lived a noble knight</l>
     <l n="16">Who sweet could sing and doughtily could fight ,</l>
     <l n="17">Whose lance thrust strong , whose long sword bit</l>
     <l n="18">full deep</l>
     <l n="19">With darting point or mighty two-edged sweep .</l>
     <l n="20">A duke was he , rich , powerful — and yet</l>
     <l n="21">Fate had on him a heavy burden set ,</l>
     <l n="22">For , while a youth , as he did hunt the boar ,</l>
     <l n="23">The savage beast his goodly steed did gore ,</l>
     <l n="24">And as the young duke thus defenceless lay ,</l>
     <l n="25">With cruel tusk had reft his looks away ,</l>
     <l n="26">Had marred his comely features and so mauled him</l>
     <l n="27">That , ‘ hind his back , “ The ugly Duke ” folk called</l>

    <head>FYTTE I</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Upon a day , but when it matters not ,</l>
     <l n="2">Nor where , but mark ! the sun was plaguy hot</l>
     <l n="3">Falling athwart a long and dusty road</l>
     <l n="4">In which same dust two dusty fellows strode .</l>
     <l n="5">One was a tall , broad-shouldered , goodly wight</l>
     <l n="6">In garb of motley like a jester dight ,</l>
     <l n="7">Fool 's cap on head with ass 's ears a-swing ,</l>
     <l n="8">While , with each stride , his bells did gaily ring ;</l>
     <l n="9">But , ‘ neath his cock'shYpppHeNcomb showed a face so marred</l>
     <l n="10">With cheek , with brow and lip so strangely scarred</l>
     <l n="11">As might scare tender maid or timid child</l>
     <l n="12">Unless , by chance , they saw him when he smiled ,</l>
     <l n="13">For then his eyes , so deeply blue and bright ,</l>
     <l n="14">Did hold in them such joyous , kindly light ,</l>
     <l n="15">That sorrow was from heavy hearts beguiled —</l>
     <l n="16">This jester seemed less ugly when he smiled .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="17">Here , O my Gill , right deftly , in a trice</l>
     <l n="18">I 've made him smile and made him do it — twice .</l>
     <l n="19">That ‘ t was the Duke of course you 've guessed at once</l>
     <l n="20">Since you , I know , we nothing of a dunce .</l>
     <l n="21">But , what should bring a duke in cap and bells ?</l>
     <l n="22">Read on and mark , while he the reason tells .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="23">Now , ‘ spite of dust and heat , his lute he strummed ,</l>
     <l n="24">And snatches of a merry song he hummed ,</l>
     <l n="25">The while askance full merrily he eyed</l>
     <l n="26">The dusty knave who plodded at his side .</l>
     <l n="27">A bony fellow , this , and long of limb ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="28">His habit poor , his aspect swart and grim ;</l>
     <l n="29">His belt to bear a long broad-sword did serve ,</l>
     <l n="30">His eye was bold , his nose did fiercely curve</l>
     <l n="31">Down which he snorted oft and ( what is worse )</l>
     <l n="32">Beneath his breath gave vent to many a curse .</l>
     <l n="33">Whereat the Duke , sly laughing , plucked lutestring</l>
     <l n="34">And thus , in voice melodious did sing :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="35">“ Sir Pertinax , why curse ye so ?</l>
     <l n="36">Since thus in humble guise we go</l>
     <l n="37">We merry chances oft may know ,</l>
     <l n="38">Sir Pertinax of Shene . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="39">“ And chances woeful , lord , also ! ”</l>
     <l n="40">Quoth Pertinax of Shene .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="41">“ To every fool that passeth by</l>
     <l n="42">These foolish bells shall testify</l>
     <l n="43">That very fool , forsooth , am I ,</l>
     <l n="44">Good Pertinax of Shene ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="45">“ And , lord , methinks they 'll tell no lie ! ”</l>
     <l n="46">Growled Pertinax of Shene .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="47">Then spake the Knight in something of a pet ,</l>
     <l n="48">“ Par Dex , lord Duke — plague take it , how I sweat ,</l>
     <l n="49">By Cock , messire , ye know I have small lust</l>
     <l n="50">Like hind or serf to tramp it i ’ the dust !</l>
     <l n="51">Per De , my lord , a parch-ed pea am I —</l>
     <l n="52">I 'm all athirst ! Athirst ? I am so dry</l>
     <l n="53">My very bones do rattle to and fro</l>
     <l n="54">And jig about within me as I go !</l>
     <l n="55">Why tramp we thus , bereft of state and rank ?</l>
     <l n="56">Why go ye , lord , like foolish mountebank ?</l>
     <l n="57">And whither doth our madcap journey trend ?</l>
     <l n="58">And wherefore ? Why ? And , prithee , to what end ? ”</l>
     <l n="59">Then quoth the Duke , “ See yonder in the green</l>
     <l n="60">Doth run a cooling water-brook I ween ,</l>
     <l n="61">Come , Pertinax , beneath yon shady trees ,</l>
     <l n="62">And there whiles we do rest outstretched at ease</l>
     <l n="63">Thy ‘ wherefores ’ and thy ‘ whys ’ shall answered be ,</l>
     <l n="64">And of our doings I will counsel thee . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="65">So turned they from the hot and dusty road</l>
     <l n="66">Where , ‘ mid green shade , a rill soft-bubbling flowed ,</l>
     <l n="67">A brook that leapt and laughed in roguish wise ,</l>
     <l n="68">Whereat Sir Pertinax with scowling eyes</l>
     <l n="69">Did frown upon the rippling water clear ,</l>
     <l n="70">And sware sad oaths because it was not beer ;</l>
     <l n="71">Sighful he knelt beside this murmurous rill ,</l>
     <l n="72">Bent steel-clad head and bravely drank his fill .</l>
     <l n="73">Then sitting down , quoth he : “ By Og and Gog ,</l>
     <l n="74">I 'll drink no more — nor horse am I nor dog</l>
     <l n="75">To gulp down water — pest , I hate the stuff ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="76">“ Ah ! ” laughed the Duke , “ ‘ tis plain hast had enough ,</l>
     <l n="77">And since well filled with water thou dost lie</l>
     <l n="78">To answer thee thy questions fain am I .</l>
     <l n="79">First then — thou art in lowly guise bedight ,</l>
     <l n="80">For that thou art my trusty , most-loved knight ,</l>
     <l n="81">Who at my side in many a bloody fray ,</l>
     <l n="82">With thy good sword hath smit grim Death away — ”</l>
     <l n="83">“ Lord , ” quoth the Knight , “ what 's done is past return ,</l>
     <l n="84">‘ Tis of our future doings I would learn . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="85">“ Aye , ” said the Duke , “ list , Pertinax , and know</l>
     <l n="86">‘ Tis on a pilgrimage of love we go :</l>
     <l n="87">Mayhap hast heard the beauty and the fame</l>
     <l n="88">Of fair Yolande , that young and peerless dame</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="89">“ For whom so many noble lovers sigh</l>
     <l n="90">And with each other in the lists do vie ?</l>
     <l n="91">Though much I 've dreamed of sweet Yolanda 's charms</l>
     <l n="92">My days have passed in wars and feats of arms ,</l>
     <l n="93">For , Pertinax , this blemished face I bear ,</l>
     <l n="94">Should fright , methinks , a lady young and fair .</l>
     <l n="95">And so it is that I have deemed it wiser</l>
     <l n="96">To hide it when I might ‘ neath casque and visor — ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="97">Hereat Sir Pertinax smote hand to knee</l>
     <l n="98">And , frowning , shook his head . “ Messire , ” said he ,</l>
     <l n="99">“ Thou art a man , and young , of noble race ,</l>
     <l n="100">And , being duke , what matter for thy face ?</l>
     <l n="101">Rank , wealth , estate — these be the things I trow</l>
     <l n="102">Can make the fairest woman tender grow .</l>
     <l n="103">Ride unto her in thy rich armour dight ,</l>
     <l n="104">With archer , man-at-arms , and many a knight</l>
     <l n="105">To swell thy train with pomp and majesty ,</l>
     <l n="106">That she , and all , thy might and rank may see ;</l>
     <l n="107">So shall all folk thy worthiness acclaim ,</l>
     <l n="108">And her maid 's heart , methinks , shall do the same .</l>
     <l n="109">Thy blemished face shall matter not one jot ;</l>
     <l n="110">To mount thy throne she 'll think a happy lot .</l>
     <l n="111">So woo her thus — ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="112">“ So will I woo her not ! ”</l>
     <l n="113">Quoth Jocelyn , “ For than I 'd win her so ,</l>
     <l n="114">Alone and loveless all my days I 'd go .</l>
     <l n="115">Ha , Pertinax , ‘ spite all thy noble parts ,</l>
     <l n="116">‘ Tis sooth ye little know of women 's hearts ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="117">“ Women ? ” quoth Pertinax , and scratched his jaw ,</l>
     <l n="118">“ ‘ Tis true of dogs and horses I know more ,</l>
     <l n="119">And dogs do bite , and steeds betimes will balk ,</l>

   <p>“ Fair Fool , ” quoth the Friar , fanning himself with a frond of bracken , “ ‘ tis a hot day , a day reminiscent of the ultimate fate of graceless sinners , and I am like the day and languish for breath , yet , to thy so pertinent question I will , straightly and in few words , pronounce and answer thee , as followeth : Our Lady Benedicta hath run away firstly , brethren , for that being formed woman after Nature 's goodly plan she hath the wherewithal to walk , to leap , to skip or eke to run , as viz . : item and to wit — legs . Secondly , inquisitorial brethren , she ran for an excellent good reason — as observe — there was none to let or stay her . And thirdly , gentle and eager hearers , she did flit or fly , leave , vacate , or depart our goodly town of Tissingors for that she had — mark me — no mind to stay , remain or abide therein . And this for the following express , rare and most curious reason as — mark now — in a word — ”</p>
   <p>“ Hold — hold , Friar John ! ” exclaimed the Reeve ; “ here sit ye here a-sermonising , venting words a-many what time our vanished Duchess fleeth . Knew I not the contrary I should say thou didst countenance her flight and spent thyself in wordy-wind wherewith to aid her ! ”</p>
   <p>Now here , chancing to meet Duke Jocelyn 's shrewd gaze , Friar John slowly and ponderously winked one round , bright eye .</p>
   <p>Quoth he :</p>
   <p>“ Hark to our valiant port-reeve Greg'ry Bax Who , save for reason , nought of reason lacks ! ” “ Howbeit , ” fumed the Reeve , stamping in the dust , “ here sit ye at thy full-bodied ease , fanning flies and animadverting — ”</p>
   <p>“ Animadverting ! ” nodded Friar John . “ A good word , Reeve , a fair , sweet word ; in verity a word full-bodied as I , wherefore it liketh me well . So sit I here animadverting whiles thou kicketh up a dust in fashion foolish and un-reeve-like . ”</p>
   <p>“ A plague o ’ words ! ” cried the Reeve . “ A pest o ’ wind ! Enough — enough , contain thy prolixities and rodomontade and let me to the point explain — ”</p>
   <p>“ Aha ! ” quoth the Friar . “ Good sooth , here 's a noble word ! A word round i ’ the mouth , rolling upon the tongue . Ha , Reeve , I give thee joy of rodomontade ! ”</p>
   <p>“ Thus then , ” continued the Reeve , “ I will , with use of no verbiage circumlocutory , explain . ”</p>
   <p>“ Ho-oho ! ” cried Friar John , rubbing plump hands ecstatic . “ Good Bax , ne'er have I heard thee to so great advantage — verbiage circumlocutory — and thou — thou such small man to boot ! O most excellent , puny Reeve ! ”</p>

   <p>Saith Pertinax : “ I meditate the way wondrous of woman , the frowardness of creatures feminine . For mark me , sir , here is one hath guardians ten , yet despite them she is fled away and they ten ! ”</p>
   <p>“ Why truly , Pertinax , they are ten , so is she fled . ”</p>
   <p>“ Aye , but if they be ten that ward her and she one that would flee , how shall this one flee these ten ? ”</p>

   <p>“ Nay , lord , here be twenty eyes to watch one young maid and twenty legs to pursue the same , yet doth she evade them one and all , and here 's the wonder o n't — she 's but one maid . ”</p>
   <p>“ Nay , there 's the reason o n't , Pertinax — she is a maid . ”</p>
   <p>“ The which is great matter for wonder , lord ! ”</p>

   <p>“ Aye , prithee and wherefore not ? ”</p>

   <p>Now when the song was ended some there were who laughed and some looked grave , some talked amain and some wagged solemn heads , while many a good coin rang heartily at Duke Jocelyn 's feet ; smiling , he bade Sir Pertinax take them up , joying to see the proud Knight stooping thus to pouch the money like any beggar . But now , when he would fain have gone his way into the town , the people would by no means suffer it and clamoured amain on all sides , insistent for more ; wherefore , lifting his scarred face to the sunset sky , Duke Jocelyn sang as here followeth :</p>

   <p>“ To touch her hand , lord — aha ! To whisper in her ear , lord — oho ! A right puissant lord , Seneschal of Raddemore , Lord of Thorn and Knight of Ells ! A lord of puissance and power potential . ”</p>

   <p>“ Aye , forsooth . ”</p>
   <p>“ Why , then , thou art like to be whipped for froward Fool and I for ragged rogue , and this our adventure brought to ill and woeful end — so here now is folly , lord , indeed ! ”</p>

   <p>Now the town was full , and every inn a-throng with company — lords , both great and small , knights and esquires and their several followings , as archers , men-at-arms , and the like , all thither come from far and near to joust at the great tournament soon to be , to honour the birthday of Benedicta , Duchess of Tissingors , Ambremont , and divers other fair cities , towns and villages . Thus our travellers sought lodgment in vain , whereat Sir Pertinax cursed beneath his breath , and Duke Jocelyn hummed , as was each his wont and custom ; and ever the grim Knight 's anger grew .</p>

     <l n="49">But here the surly landlord raised much clamour and outcry , whiles he</l>
     <l n="50">touched and caressed his great ears with rare gentleness .</l>

   </lg>
   <p>“ Oho , my yeres ! ” roared he . “ My yeres do be in woeful estate .

   <p>“ Thine ears , unsavoury scullion , ” laughed Jocelyn ; “ thine ears , forsooth ? Hark ye , of thy so great , so fair , so fine ears I 'll incontinent make a song . List ye , one and all , so shall all here now hear my song of ears ! ” Forthwith Duke Jocelyn struck his lute and sang :</p>

     <l n="4">Round ears also and rare ears .</l>
     <l n="5">So here 's an ear that all eyes here</l>

     <l n="7">For these o ’ thine be such ears ,</l>

     <l n="14">Thine ears plain the blame must bear .</l>
     <l n="15">So of thine ears no more complain ,</l>

   <p>Now hereupon was huge laughter and merriment , insomuch that the thick-jowled landlord betook himself otherwhere , and all men thronged upon our jester , vociferous for more .</p>
   <p>“ Aye , but , bold tosspots , ” laughed Jocelyn , “ how now , sit ye without wine in very truth ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Not so , good Fool , ” they cried . “ Here be wine a-plenty for us and for thee ! ”</p>
   <p>“ Go to , tall topers , ” quoth the Duke , “ ye are witless , in faith , for there is no man here but is without wine , as in song will I shew — mark now :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ ‘ Tis plain that ye are wine without ,</l>
     <l n="2">Since wine 's within ye , topers stout .</l>

   </lg>
   <p>By such tricks of rhyme , jugglery of words , and the like , Duke Jocelyn won this fierce company to great good humour and delight ; insomuch that divers of these roysterers pressed wine upon him and money galore . But , the hour growing late , he contrived at last to steal away with Sir Pertinax , which last , having fed copiously , now yawned consumedly , eager for bed . Howbeit , despite the Knight 's fierce threats , they found no bed was to be had in all the inn , and so , perforce , betook them at last to the stable .</p>

   <p>But now , beholding Yolande amid her flowers , herself as sweet and fresh as they , he made an end of his singing and betook him , straightway , to amorous looks and deep-fetched sighs together with many supple bendings of the back , elegant posturings and motitions of slim legs , fannings and flauntings of be-feathered cap , and the like gallantries ; and thereafter fell to his wooing on this fashion :</p>
   <p>“ Lady , O lady of lovely ladies most loved ! Fair lady of hearts , sweet dame of tenderness , tender me thine ears , suffer one , hath sighed and suffered for sake of thee , to sightful sue . Lovely thou art and therefore to be loved , and day and night thou and Love the sum of my excogitations art , wherefore I , with loving art , am hither come to woo thee , since , lady , I do love thee . ”</p>
   <p>“ Alack , Sir Palamon ! ” she sighed , “ and is it so ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Alack ! ” he answered , “ so it is . Yest 're'en I did proclaim thee fairer than all fair ladies ; to-day thou art yet fairer , thus this day thou art fairer than thyself ; the which , though a paradox , is yet wittily true and truly witty , methinks . But as for me — for me , alas for me ! I am forsooth the very slave of love , fettered fast by Dan Cupid , a slave grievous and woeful , yet , being thy slave , joying in my slavery and happy in my grievous woe . Thus it is I groan and moan , lady ; I pine , repine and pine again most consumedly . I sleep little and eat less , I am , in fine and in all ways , ‘ haviours , manners , customs , feints and fashions soever , thy lover manifest , confessed , subject , abject , in season and out of season , yearly , monthly , daily , hourly , and by the minute . Moreover — ”</p>
   <p>“ Beseech thee ! ” she cried , “ Oh , beseech thee , take thy breath . ”</p>
   <p>“ Gramercy , ‘ tis done , lady , ‘ tis done , and now forthwith resolved am I to sing thee — ”</p>
   <p>“ Nay , I pray you , sir , sing no more , but resolve me this mystery . What is love ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Love , lady ? Verily that will I in truth ! ” And herewith Sir Palamon fell to an attitude of thought with eyes ecstatic , with knitted brows and sage nodding of the head . “ Love , my lady — ha ! Love , lady is — hum ! Love , then , perceive me , is of its nature elemental , being of the elements , as ‘ twere , composed and composite , as water , air and fire . For , remark me , there is no love but begetteth first water , which is tears ; air , which is sighings and groanings ; and fire , which is heart-burnings and the like . Thus is love a passion elemental . But yet , and heed me , lady , love is also metaphysical , being a motition of the soul and e'en the spirit , and being of the spirit ‘ tis ghostly , and being ghostly ‘ tis — ha ! Who comes hither to shatter the placid mirror of my thoughts ? ”</p>
   <p>So saying , the noble knight of Tong turned to behold one who strode towards them in haste , a tall man this whose black brows scowled fierce upon the day , and who spurned the tender flowers with foot ungentle as he came .</p>

     <l n="1">How Pertinax plied angle to his sport</l>
     <l n="2">And , catching him no fish , fish-like was caught .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">By sleepy stream where bending willows swayed ,</l>
     <l n="4">And , from the sun , a greeny twilight made ,</l>
     <l n="5">Sir Pertinax , broad back against a tree ,</l>
     <l n="6">Lolled at his ease and yawned right lustily .</l>
     <l n="7">In brawny fist he grasped a rod or angle ,</l>
     <l n="8">With hook wherefrom sad worm did , writhing , dangle .</l>
     <l n="9">Full well he loved the piscatorial sport ,</l>
     <l n="10">Though he as yet no single fish had caught .</l>
     <l n="11">Hard by , in easy reach upon the sward ,</l>
     <l n="12">Lay rusty bascinet and good broadsword .</l>
     <l n="13">Thus patiently the good Knight sat and fished ,</l>
     <l n="14">Yet in his heart most heartily he wished</l>
     <l n="15">That he , instead of fishing , snug had been</l>
     <l n="16">Seated within his goodly tower of Shene .</l>
     <l n="17">And thinking thus , he needs must cast his eye</l>
     <l n="18">On rusty mail , on battered shoon , and sigh ,</l>
     <l n="19">And murmur fitful curses and lament</l>
     <l n="20">That in such base , unknightly garb he went —</l>
     <l n="21">A lord of might whose broad shield bravely bore</l>
     <l n="22">Of proud and noble quarterings a score .</l>
     <l n="23">“ And ‘ t was forsooth for foolish ducal whim</l>
     <l n="24">That he must plod abroad in such vile trim ! ”</l>
     <l n="25">Revolving thus , his anger sudden woke ,</l>
     <l n="26">And , scowling , to the unseen fish he spoke :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="27">“ A Duke ! A Fool ! A fool-duke , by my head !</l>
     <l n="28">Who , clad like Fool , like Fool will fain be wed ,</l>

     <l n="29">For ass and dolt and fool of fools is he</l>

     <l n="32">Must he in motley seek the haughty dame ? ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="33">But now , while he did on this problem dwell ,</l>
     <l n="34">Two unexpected happenings befell :</l>
     <l n="35">A fish to nibble on the worm began ,</l>
     <l n="36">And to him through the green a fair maid ran .</l>
     <l n="37">Fast , fast amid the tangled brake she fled ,</l>
     <l n="38">Her cheeks all pale , her dark eyes wide with dread ;</l>
     <l n="39">But Pertinax her beauty nothing heeded ,</l>
     <l n="40">Since both his eyes to watch his fish were needed ;</l>
     <l n="41">But started round with sudden , peevish snort</l>
     <l n="42">As in slim hands his brawny fist she caught ;</l>
     <l n="43">“ Ha , maid ! ” he cried , “ Why must thou come this way</l>
     <l n="44">To spoil my sport and fright mine fish away ? ”</l>
     <l n="45">“ O man — O man , if man thou art , ” she gasped ,</l>
     <l n="46">“ Save me ! ” And here his hand she closer grasped ,</l>
     <l n="47">But even now , as thus she breathless spake ,</l>
     <l n="48">Forth of the wood three lusty fellows brake ;</l>
     <l n="49">Goodly their dress and bright the mail they wore ,</l>
     <l n="50">While on their breasts a falcon-badge they bore .</l>
     <l n="51">“ Oho ! ” cried one . “ Yon dirty knave she 's met ! ”</l>
     <l n="52">Sir Pertinax here donned his bascinet .</l>
     <l n="53">“ But one poor rogue sha n't let us ! ” t ’ other roared .</l>
     <l n="54">Sir Pertinax here reached and drew his sword .</l>
     <l n="55">“ Then , ” cried the third , “ let 's at him now all three ! ”</l>
     <l n="56">Quoth Pertinax : “ Maid , get thee ‘ hind yon tree ,</l>
     <l n="57">For now , methinks , hast found me better sport</l>
     <l n="58">Than if , forsooth , yon plaguy fish I 'd caught . ”</l>
     <l n="59">So saying , up he rose and , eyes a-dance</l>
     <l n="60">He ‘ gainst the three did joyously advance ,</l>
     <l n="61">With sword that flashed full bright , but brighter yet</l>
     <l n="62">The eyes beneath his rusty bascinet ;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="63">While aspect bold and carriage proud and high ,</l>
     <l n="64">Did plainly give his mean array the lie .</l>
     <l n="65">Thus , as he gaily strode to meet the three ,</l>
     <l n="66">In look and gesture all proud knight was he ;</l>
     <l n="67">Beholding which , the maid forgot her dread ,</l>
     <l n="68">And , ‘ stead of pale , her cheek glowed softly red .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="69">Now at the three Sir Pertinax did spring ,</l>
     <l n="70">And clashing steel on steel did loudly ring ,</l>
     <l n="71">Yet Pertinax was one and they were three ,</l>
     <l n="72">And once was , swearing , smitten to his knee ,</l>
     <l n="73">Whereat the maid hid face in sudden fear ,</l>
     <l n="74">And , kneeling so , fierce cries and shouts did hear ,</l>
     <l n="75">The sounds of combat dire , and deadly riot</l>
     <l n="76">Lost all at once and hushed to sudden quiet ,</l>
     <l n="77">And glancing up she saw to her amaze</l>
     <l n="78">Three rogues who fleetly ran three several ways ,</l>
     <l n="79">Three beaten rogues who fled with one accord ,</l>
     <l n="80">While Pertinax , despondent , sheathed his sword .</l>
     <l n="81">“ Par Dex ! ” he growled , “ ‘ Tis shame that they should run</l>
     <l n="82">Ere that to fight the rogues had scarce begun ! ”</l>
     <l n="83">So back he came , his rod and line he took ,</l>
     <l n="84">And gloomed to find no worm upon his hook .</l>
     <l n="85">But now the maiden viewed him gentle-eyed ;</l>
     <l n="86">“ Brave soldier , I do thank thee well ! ” she sighed ,</l>
     <l n="87">“ Thou , like true knight , hast fought for me today — ”</l>
     <l n="88">“ And the fish , ” sighed he , “ have stole my worm away ,</l>
     <l n="89">Which is great pity , since my worms be few ! ”</l>
     <l n="90">And here the Knight 's despond but deeper grew .</l>
     <l n="91">“ Yon rogues , ” he sighed , “ no stomach had for fight ,</l>
     <l n="92">Yet scared the fish that had a mind to bite ! ”</l>
     <l n="93">“ But thou hast saved me , noble man ! ” said she .</l>
     <l n="94">“ So must I use another worm ! ” sighed he .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="95">And straightway with his fishing he proceeded</l>
     <l n="96">While sat the maid beside him all unheeded ;</l>
     <l n="97">Whereat she frowned and , scornful , thus did speak</l>
     <l n="98">With angry colour flaming in her cheek :</l>
     <l n="99">“ What man art thou that canst but fight and fish ?</l>
     <l n="100">Hast thou no higher thought , no better wish ? ”</l>
     <l n="101">“ Certes , ” quoth he , “ I would I had indeed</l>
     <l n="102">A goodly pot of foaming ale or mead . ”</l>
     <l n="103">“ O base , most base ! ” the maid did scornful cry ,</l>
     <l n="104">And viewed him o'er with proud , disdainful eye .</l>
     <l n="105">“ That I should owe my life to man like thee !</l>
     <l n="106">That one so base could fight and master three !</l>
     <l n="107">Who art thou , man , and what ? Speak me thy name ,</l>
     <l n="108">Whither ye go and why , and whence ye came ,</l>
     <l n="109">Thy rank , thy state , thy worth to me impart ,</l>
     <l n="110">If soldier , serf , or outlawed man thou art ;</l>
     <l n="111">And why ‘ neath ragged habit thou dost wear</l>
     <l n="112">A chain of gold such as but knights do bear ,</l>
     <l n="113">Why thou canst front three armed rogues unafraid ,</l>
     <l n="114">Yet fear methinks to look upon a maid ? ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="115">But to these questions Pertinax sat dumb —</l>
     <l n="116">That is , he rubbed his chin and murmured , “ Hum ! ”</l>
     <l n="117">Whereat she , frowning , set determined chin</l>
     <l n="118">And thus again to question did begin :</l>

     <l n="145">SHE : And thou a man , ill-tongued , ill-beseen , ill-mannered , unlovely ,</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="37">
     <l n="147">HE : And what is worse , the fish bite not .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Now here , and very suddenly , she fell a-weeping , to the Knight 's no small discomfiture , though she wept in fashion wondrous apt and pretty ; wherefore Sir Pertinax glanced at her once , looked twice and , looking , scratched his ear , rubbed his chin and finally questioned her in turn :</p>
   <p>HE : Distressful damosel , wherefore this dole ? SHE : For that I am weary , woeful and solitary . And thou — thou'rt harsh of look , rough of tongue , ungentle of — HE : Misfortunate maiden , thy loneliness is soon amended , get thee to thy friends — thy gossips , thy —</p>
   <p>SHE : I have none . And thou'rt fierce and ungentle of face .</p>
   <p>Here she wept the more piteously and Sir Pertinax , viewing her distress , forgot his hook and worm , wherefore a fish nibbled it slyly , while the Knight questioned her further :</p>
   <p>HE : Woeful virgin , whence comest thou ?</p>
   <p>SHE : From afar . And thou art ofeatures grim and —</p>
   <p>HE : And whither would'st journey ?</p>
   <p>SHE : No where ! And thou art —</p>
   <p>HE : Nay , here is thing impossible , since being here thou art somewhere and that within three bowshots of the goodly town of Canalise wherein thou shalt doubtless come by comfort and succour .</p>
   <p>SHE : Never ! Never ! Here will I weep and moan and perish . And thou —</p>
   <p>HE : And wherefore moan and perish ?</p>
   <p>SHE : For that I am so minded , being a maid forlorn and desolate , a poor wanderer destitute of kith , of kin , of hope , of love , and all that maketh life sweet . And thou art sour-faced and —</p>
   <p>HE : Grievous maid , is , among thy many wants , a lack of money ?</p>
   <p>SHE : That also . And thou art cold of eye , fierce of mouth , hooked of nose , flinty of heart , stony of soul , and I a perishing maid .</p>
   <p>At this Sir Pertinax blinked and caught his breath ; thereafter he laid down his rod , whereupon the fish incontinent filched his worm all unnoticed while the Knight opened the wallet at his girdle and took thence certain monies .</p>
   <p>HE : Dolorous damsel , behold six good , gold pieces ! Take them and go , get thee to eat — eat much , so shall thy dolour wax less , eat beef — since beef is a rare lightener of sorrow , by beef shall thy woes be comforted .</p>
   <p>SHE : Alas ! I love not beef .</p>
   <p>Now here Sir Pertinax was dumb a space for wonder at her saying , while she stole a glance at him betwixt slender fingers .</p>
   <p>HE ( after some while ): Maid , I tell thee beef , fairly cooked and aptly seasoned , is of itself a virtue whereby the body is strengthened and nourished , whereby cometh content , and with content kindliness , and with kindliness charity , and therewith all other virtues small and eke great ; therefore eat beef , maiden , for the good of thy soul .</p>
   <p>“ How ? ” said she , viewing him bright-eyed ‘ twixt her fingers again . “ Dost think by beef one may attain to paradise ? ”</p>
   <p>HE : Peradventure .</p>
   <p>SHE : Then no beef , for I would not live a saint yet awhile .</p>
   <p>HE : Nathless , take thou these monies and go buy what thou wilt .</p>
   <p>So saying , Sir Pertinax set the coins beside her shapely foot and took up his neglected rod .</p>
   <p>SHE : And is this gold truly mine ?</p>
   <p>HE : Verily .</p>
   <p>SHE : Then I pray thee keep it for me lest I lose it by the way and so — let us begone .</p>
   <p>Here Sir Pertinax started .</p>
   <p>“ Begone ? ” quoth he . “ Begone — in truth ? Thou and I in faith ? Go whither ? ”</p>
   <p>SHE : Any whither .</p>
   <p>HE : Alone ? Thou and I ?</p>
   <p>“ Nay , not alone , ” she sighed ; “ let us go together . ”</p>
   <p>Sir Pertinax dropped his fishing-rod and watched it idly float away down the stream :</p>
   <p>“ Together , maiden ? ” said he at last .</p>
   <p>“ Truly ! ” she sighed . “ For thou art lonely even as I am lonely , and thou art , methinks , one a lonely maid may trust . ”</p>
   <p>“ Ha — trust ! ” quoth he . “ And wherefore would'st trust me , maiden ? ”</p>
   <p>SHE : For two reasons — thou art of age mature and something ill-favoured .</p>
   <p>Now , at this Sir Pertinax grew angered , grew thoughtful , grew sad and , beholding his image mirrored in the waters , sighed for his grim , unlovely look and , in his heart , cursed his vile garb anew . At last he spoke :</p>
   <p>HE : Truly thou may'st trust me , maiden .</p>
   <p>SHE : And wherefore sighest thou , sad soldier ?</p>
   <p>HE : Verily for thy two reasons . Though , for mine age , I am not forty turned .</p>
   <p>Saying which , he sighed again , and stared gloomily into the murmurous waters . But presently , chancing to look aside , he beheld a head low down amid the underwood , a head huge and hairy with small , fierce eyes that watched him right bodefully , and a great mouth that grinned evilly ; and now as he stared , amazed by this monstrous head , it nodded grimly , speaking thus :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Lob , Lobkyn he</l>
     <l n="2">Commandeth thee</l>
     <l n="3">To let her be</l>
     <l n="4">And set her free ,</l>
     <l n="5">Thou scurvy , cutpurse , outlaw knave ,</l>
     <l n="6">Lest hanged thou be</l>
     <l n="7">Upon a tree</l>
     <l n="8">For roguery</l>
     <l n="9">And villainy ,</l>
     <l n="10">Thou knavish , misbegotten slave ;</l>
     <l n="11">For proud is she</l>
     <l n="12">Of high degree ,</l>
     <l n="13">As unto ye</l>
     <l n="14">Explicitly — ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>“ Ha ! ” quoth Sir Pertinax , rising and drawing sword . “ Now , be thou imp of Satan , fiend accursed , or goblin fell , come forth , and I with steel will try thee , Thing ! ”</p>
   <p>Out from the leaves forthwith crawled a dwarf bowed of leg , mighty of shoulder , humped of back , and with arms very long and thick and hairy . In one great fist he grasped a ponderous club shod with iron spikes , and now , resting his hands on this and his chin on his hands , he scowled at the Knight , yet grinned also .</p>
   <p>“ Ho ! ” he cried , rolling big head in threatening fashion :</p>
   <p>“ Vile dog , thy rogue 's sconce cracked shall be , Thy base-born bones be-thwacked shall be . I 'll deal thee many a dour ding For that thou darest name me — Thing ! ”</p>
   <p>“ Now , as I live ! ” said Sir Pertinax , scowling also . “ Here will I , and with great joyance , cleave me thine impish mazzard and split thee to thy beastly chine . And for thy ill rhyming :</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ I with this goodly steel will halve thee</l>
     <l n="2">And into clammy goblets carve thee .</l>
     <l n="3">So stand , Thing , to thy club betake thee ,</l>
     <l n="4">And soon , Thing , I will no-thing make thee . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">But , as they closed on each other with eager and deadly intent , the maid</l>
     <l n="6">stepped lightly betwixt .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="7">“ Stay , soldier — hold ! ” she commanded . “ Here is none but Lobkyn Lollo — poor ,</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="9">“ How , maiden ? ” snorted the good Knight fiercely . “ Harm me , say'st thou — yon</l>
     <l n="10">puny Thing ? ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>“ Truly , soldier ! ” said she , roguish-eyed . “ For though thou art very ungentle , harsh of tongue , of visage grim and manners rude — I would not have Lob harm thee — yet ! ”</p>

     <l n="1">Now hereupon our bold Sir Pertinax</l>
     <l n="2">With indignation red of face did wax .</l>
     <l n="3">The needful word his tongue was vainly seeking ,</l>

     <l n="6">His tongue all times unready was and slow ,</l>
     <l n="7">Therefore he speechless looked upon the maid ,</l>
     <l n="8">Who viewed him ‘ neath her lashes ’ dusky shade ,</l>
     <l n="9">Whence Eros launched a sudden beamy dart</l>
     <l n="10">That ‘ spite chain-mail did reach and pierce his heart .</l>
     <l n="11">And in that instant Pertinax grew wise ,</l>
     <l n="12">And trembled ‘ neath this forest-maiden 's eyes ;</l>
     <l n="13">And trembling , knew full well , seek where he might ,</l>
     <l n="14">No eyes might hold for him such magic light ,</l>
     <l n="15">No lips might hold for him such sweet allure ,</l>
     <l n="16">No other hand might his distresses cure ,</l>
     <l n="17">No other voice might so console and cheer ,</l>
     <l n="18">No foot , light-treading , be so sweet to hear</l>
     <l n="19">As the eyes , lips , hand , voice , foot of her who stood</l>
     <l n="20">Before him now , cheek flushing ‘ neath her hood .</l>
     <l n="21">All this Sir Pertinax had in his thought ,</l>
     <l n="22">And , wishing much to say to her , said nought ,</l>
     <l n="23">By reason that his tongue was something slow ,</l>
     <l n="24">And of smooth phrases he did little know .</l>
     <l n="25">But yet ‘ t is likely , though he nothing said ,</l>
     <l n="26">She , maid-like , what he spake not , guessed or read</l>
     <l n="27">In his flushed brow , his sudden-gentle eyes ,</l>
     <l n="28">Since in such things all maids are wondrous wise .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="29">Now suddenly the brawny Dwarf did cry :</l>
     <l n="30">“ Beware , my old great-grand-dam creepeth nigh ! ”</l>
     <l n="31">Thus speaking , ‘ mid the bushes pointed he ,</l>
     <l n="32">Where crook 'd old woman crouched beneath a tree</l>
     <l n="33">Whence , bowed upon a staff , she towards them came ,</l>
     <l n="34">An ancient , wrinkled , ragged , hag-like dame</l>
     <l n="35">With long , sharp nose that downward curved as though</l>
     <l n="36">It fain would , beak-like , peck sharp chin below .</l>
     <l n="37">Mutt'ring she came and mowing she drew near ,</l>
     <l n="38">And straightway seized the Dwarf by hairy ear :</l>
     <l n="39">Fast by the ear this ancient dame did tweak him ,</l>
     <l n="40">And cuffed his head and , cuffing , thus did speak him :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="41">“ Ha , dolt ! Bad elf , and wilt thou slay , indeed ,</l>
     <l n="42">This goodly man did aid me in my need ?</l>
     <l n="43">For this was one that fought within the gate</l>
     <l n="44">And from Black Lewin saved thy grannam 's pate !</l>
     <l n="45">Down , down , fool-lad , upon thy knees , I say ,</l>
     <l n="46">And full forgiveness of this soldier pray . ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>But Sir Pertinax , perceiving how the old dame did thus tweak and wring at the Dwarf 's great , hairy ear even until his eyes watered , interceded , saying :</p>
   <p>“ Good , ancient soul , humble not the sturdy , unlovely , mis-shapen , rascally imp for such small matter . ”</p>
   <p>“ Nay , but , ” croaked the old woman , tightening claw-like fingers , “ kind master , he would doubtless have slain thee . ” At this , Sir Pertinax scowled , and would have sworn great oath but , meeting the maid 's bright eyes , checked himself , though with much ado :</p>
   <p>“ Art so sure , ” he questioned , “ so sure man of my inches may be slain by thing so small ? ”</p>
   <p>At this the maid laughed , and the old woman , sighing , loosed the ear she clutched :</p>
   <p>“ Shew thy strength , Lob , ” she commanded and , drawing the maiden out of ear-shot , sat down beside her on the sward and fell to eager , whispered talk . Meantime the Dwarf , having cherished his ear , sulkily though tenderly , seized hold upon his great club with both hairy hands :</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">And whirling it aloft , with sudden might</l>
     <l n="2">A fair , young tree in sunder he did smite ,</l>
     <l n="3">That ‘ neath the blow it swayed and crashing fell .</l>
     <l n="4">Quoth Pertinax : “ Good Thing , ‘ t is very well .</l>
     <l n="5">Par Dex , and by the Holy Rood , ” quoth he ,</l>
     <l n="6">“ ‘ T is just as well that I was not yon tree ! ”</l>
     <l n="7">And whirling his long sword as thus he spoke ,</l>
     <l n="8">Shore through another at a single stroke .</l>
     <l n="9">“ Here 's tree for tree , stout manling ! ” he did say .</l>
     <l n="10">“ What other trick canst show to me , I pray ? ”</l>
     <l n="11">Then Lobkyn stooped the broken stump to seize ,</l>
     <l n="12">Bowed brawny back and with a wondrous ease</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="13">Up by the roots the rugged bole he tore</l>
     <l n="14">And tossed it far as it had been a straw .</l>
     <l n="15">Sad grew our knight this mighty feat perceiving ,</l>
     <l n="16">Since well he knew't was past his own achieving .</l>

   <p>Hereupon the Dwarf cut a caper but sighed thereafter : quoth he :</p>

    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="32">But the ancient dame who had risen and approached silently , now very</l>
     <l n="33">suddenly took Lobkyn by the ear again .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>“ Talk not of blood and battles , naughty one ! ” she cried . “ Think not to leave thy old grannam lone and lorn and helpless — nor this our fair maid . Shame on thee , Lob , O shame ! ” saying the which she cuffed him again and soundly .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Master , ” he sighed , “ thou seest I may not go ,</l>
     <l n="2">Since that my grand-dam will not have it so . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>“ Good mother , wise mother , ” said the maid , viewing Sir Pertinax smilingly askance , “ why doth poor soldier go bedight in fine linen ‘ neath rusty hauberk ? Why doth poor soldier wear knightly chain about his neck and swear by knightly oath ? Good mother , wise mother , rede me this . ”</p>
   <p>The old woman viewed Pertinax with her bright , quick eyes , but , ere she could answer , he sheathed sword , drew ragged mantle about him , and made to go , but , turning to the maid , bent steel-clad head .</p>
   <p>“ Most fair damosel , ” said he gently , “ evening cometh on , and now , since thou art no longer forlorn , I will away . ”</p>
   <p>“ Nay , first , I pray thee , what is thy name ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Pertinax , madam . ”</p>
   <p>“ So then doth Melissa thank Pertinax . And now — out alas ! Will Pertinax leave Melissa , having but found her ? ”</p>
   <p>Sir Pertinax looked up , looked down , fidgeted with his cloak , and knew not how to answer ; wherefore she sighed again , though with eyes full merry ‘ neath drooping lashes and reached out to him her slender hand . “ Aye me , and shall we meet no more , poor soldier ? ” she questioned softly .</p>
   <p>“ This I know not , ” he answered .</p>
   <p>“ For thy brave rescue I do give thee my humble thanks , poor soldier . ”</p>
   <p>“ Thy rescue , child ? ” cried the old woman . “ Alack and wert thou seen ? Thy rescue , say'st thou ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Indeed , good mother , from Sir Agramore 's rough foresters . But for thee , thou needy soldier , my gratitude is thine henceforth . Had I aught else to give thee , that were thine also . Is there aught I may ? Speak . ”</p>
   <p>Now Sir Pertinax could not but heed all the rich , warm beauty of her — these eyes so sombrely sweet , her delicate nose , the temptation of her vivid lips — and so spake hot with impulse :</p>
   <p>“ Aye , truly , sweet maid , truly I would have of thee a — ” Her eyes grew bright with laughter , a dimple played wanton in her cheek , and Sir Pertinax was all suddenly abashed , faint-hearted and unsure ; thus , looking down , he chanced to espy a strange jewel that hung tremulous upon her moving bosom : a crowned heart within a heart of crystal .</p>
   <p>“ Well , thou staid and sorry soldier , what would'st have of me ? ” she questioned .</p>
   <p>“ Verily , ” he muttered , “ I would have of thee yon trinket from thy bosom . ” Now at his words she started , caught her breath and stared at him wide-eyed ; but , seeing his abashment , laughed and loosed off the jewel with quick , small fingers .</p>
   <p>“ Be it so ! ” said she . But hereupon the old woman reached out sudden hand .</p>
   <p>“ Child ! ” she croaked , “ Art mad ? Mind ye not the prophecy ? Beware the prophecy — beware !</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">‘ He that taketh Crystal Heart ,</l>

     <l n="3">Beware , I say , Oh , beware ! ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>“ Nay , good mother , have I not promised ? And for this crystal it hath brought me nought but unease hitherto . Take it , soldier , and for the sake of this poor maid that giveth , break it not , dishonour it not , and give it to none but can define for thee the secret thereof — and so , poor , brave , fearful soldier — fare thee well ! ”</p>
   <p>Saying which this fair maiden turned , and clasping the Witch 's bony arm about her slender loveliness , passed away into the denser wood with Lobkyn Lollo marching grimly behind , his mighty club across his shoulder .</p>
   <p>Long stood Sir Pertinax , staring down at the strange jewel in his hand yet seeing it not , for , lost in his dreams , he beheld again two eyes , dusky - lashed and softly bright , a slender hand , a shapelyfoot , while in his ears was again the soft murmur of a maid 's voice , a trill of girlish laughter . So lost in meditation was he that becoming aware of a shadow athwart the level sunset-glory , he started , glanced up and into the face of a horseman who had ridden up unheard upon the velvet ling ; and this man was tall and armed at points like a knight ; the vizor of his plumed casque was lifted , and Sir Pertinax saw a ruddy face , keen-eyed , hawk-nosed , thin-lipped .</p>
   <p>“ Fellow , ” questioned the haughty knight , “ what hold ye there ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Fellow , ” quoth Sir Pertinax , haughty and gruff also , “ ‘ t is no matter to thee ! ” And speaking , he buttoned the jewel into the wallet at his belt .</p>
   <p>“ Fool ! ” exclaimed the Knight , staring in amaze , “ wilt dare name me ‘ fellow ’ ? Tell me , didst see three foresters hereabout ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Poltroon , I did . ”</p>
   <p>“ Knave , wilt defy me ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Rogue , I do ! ”</p>
   <p>“ Slave , what did these foresters ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Villain , they ran away ! ”</p>
   <p>“ Ha , varlet ! and wherefore ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Caitiff , I drubbed them shrewdly . ”</p>
   <p>“ Dared ye withstand them , dog ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Minion , I did . ”</p>
   <p>“ Saw ye not the badge they bore ? ” demanded the fierce stranger-knight .</p>
   <p>“ ‘ T was the like of that upon thy shield ! ” nodded Sir Pertinax grimly .</p>
   <p>“ Know ye who and what I am , dunghill rogue ? ”</p>
   <p>“ No , dog'shYpppHeNbreakfast — nor care ! ” growled Sir Pertinax , whereat the stranger-knight grew sudden red and clenched mailed fist .</p>
   <p>“ Know then , thou kennel-scourer , that I am Sir</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Agramore of Biename , Lord of Swanscote and Hoccom , Lord Seneschal of</l>
     <l n="2">Tissingors and the March . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">“ Ha ! ” quoth Sir Pertinax , scowling . “ So do I know thee for a very rogue</l>
     <l n="4">ingrain and villain manifest . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="5">“ How ! ” roared Sir Agramore . “ This to my face , thou vile creeper of ditches ,</l>
     <l n="6">thou unsavoury tavern-haunter — this in my teeth ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="7">“ Heartily , heartily ! ” nodded Sir Pertinax . “ And may it choke thee for the</l>
     <l n="8">knavish carcass thou art . ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>At this , and very suddenly , the Knight loosed mace from saddle-bow , and therewith smote Sir Pertinax on rusty bascinet , and tumbled him backward among the bracken . Which done , Sir Agramore laughed full loud and , spurring his charger , galloped furiously away . And after some while Sir Pertinax arose , albeit unsteadily , but finding his legs weak , sat him down again ; thereafter with fumbling hands he did off dinted bascinet and viewed it thoughtfully , felt his head tenderly and , crawling to the stream , bathed it solicitously ; then , being greatly heartened , he arose and drawing sword , set it upright in the ling and , kneeling , clasped his hands and spake as follows :</p>
   <p>“ Here and now , upon my good cross-hilt I swear I will with joy and zeal unremitting , seek me out one Sir Agramore of Biename . Then will I incontinent with any , all , or whatsoever weapon he chooseth fall upon him and , for this felon stroke , for his ungentle dealing with the maid , I will forthwith gore , rend , tear , pierce , batter , bruise and otherwise use the body of the said Sir Agramore until , growing aweary of its vile tenement , his viler soul shall flee hence to consume evermore with such unholy knaves as he . And this is the oath of me , Sir Pertinax ,</p>
   <p>Knight of Shene , Lord of Westover , Framling , Bracton and Deepdene , to the which oath may the Saints bend gracious ear , in especial Our Holy Lady of Shene Chapel within the Wood — Amen ! ”</p>
   <p>Having registered the which most solemn oath , Sir Pertinax arose , sheathed his sword , and strode blithely towards the fair and prosperous town of Canalise . But , being come within the gate , he was aware of much riot and confusion in the square and streets beyond , and hasting forward , beheld a wild concourse , a pushing , jostling throng of people making great clamour and outcry , above which hubbub ever and anon rose such shouts , as : “ Murderer ! Thief ! Away with him ! Death to him ! ”</p>
   <p>By dint of sharp elbow and brawny shoulder our good knight forced himself a way until — surrounded by men-at-arms , his limbs fast bound , his motley torn and bloody , his battered fool'shYpppHeNcap all awry — he beheld Duke Jocelyn haled and dragged along by fierce hands . For a moment Sir Pertinax stood dumb with horror and amaze , then , roaring , clapped hand to sword . Now , hearing this fierce and well-known battle shout , Duke Jocelyn turned and , beholding the Knight , shook bloody head in warning and slowly closed one bright , blue eye ; and so , while Sir Pertinax stood rigid and dumb , was dragged away and lost in the fierce , jostling throng .</p>

     <l n="4">Duke Joc'lyn lay in sad and woeful plight ;</l>
     <l n="5">His hands and feet with massy fetters bound ,</l>
     <l n="6">That clashed , whene'er he moved , with dismal sound ;</l>
     <l n="7">His back against the clammy wall did rest ,</l>
     <l n="8">His heavy head was bowed upon his breast ,</l>

     <l n="13">But Joc'lyn , huddled thus against the wall ,</l>
     <l n="14">Seemed verily to heed them none at all ,</l>
     <l n="15">Wherefore a red-haired rogue who thought he slept</l>
     <l n="16">With full intent upon him furtive crept .</l>
     <l n="17">But , ere he knew , right suddenly he felt</l>
     <l n="18">Duke Joc'lyn ' s battered shoe beneath his belt ;</l>
     <l n="19">And falling back with sudden strangled cry ,</l>
     <l n="20">Flat on his back awhile did breathless lie ,</l>
     <l n="21">Whereat to rage his comrades did begin ,</l>
     <l n="22">And clashed their fetters with such doleful din</l>
     <l n="23">That from a corner dim a fourth man sprang ,</l>
     <l n="24">And laughed and laughed , until their prison rang .</l>
     <l n="25">“ Well kicked , Sir Fool ! Forsooth , well done ! ” laughed he ,</l>

     <l n="23">Till suddenly the massy door</l>
     <l n="24">On creaking hinge did swing ;</l>
     <l n="25">And to them the head jailer now appeared ,</l>
     <l n="26">A sombre man who sighed through tangled beard .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>“ How now , rogue-lads , ” said he , “ grow ye merry in sooth by reason o ’ this Fool ! Aye me , all men do grow merry save only I , Ranulph , Chief Torturer , Ranulph o ’ the Keys , o ’ the Gibbet , o ’ the City Axe — poor Ranulph the Headsman . Good lack ! I 've cut off the head o ’ many a man merrier than I — aye , that have I , and more 's the pity ! And now , ye that are to die so soon can wax joyous along o ’ this motley Fool ! Why , ‘ t is a manifest good Fool , and rare singer o ’ songs , ‘ t is said , though malapert , with no respect for his betters and over-quick at dagger-play . So ‘ t is a Fool must die and sing no more , and there 's the pity o n't for I do love a song , I — being a companionable soul and jovial withal , aye , a very bawcock of a boy , I. To-morrow Red Gui doth hale ye to his Castle o ’ the Rock , there to die all five for his good pleasure , as is very fitting and proper , so be merry whiles ye may . Meantime , behold here another rogue , a youngling imp . So is five become six , and six may laugh louder than five , methinks , so laugh your best . ”</p>
   <p>Then Ranulph o ’ the Keys sighed , closed the great door and went his way , leaving the new captive to their mercies . Fair he was and slender , and of a timid seeming , for now he crouched against the wall , his face hid ‘ neath the hood of ragged mantle ; wherefore the “ saintly ” three incontinent scowled upon him , roared at him and made a horrid clashing with their fetters :</p>
   <p>“ Ha , blood and bones ! ” cried Rick the Ploughman . “ What murderous babe art thou to go unshackled in presence o ’ thy betters ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Aye , forsooth , ” growled Will the Tanner , “ who ‘ rt thou to come hither distressing the last hours o ’ we poor , perishing mortals ? Discourse , lest I bite the heart o ’ thee ! ”</p>
   <p>“ Pronounce , imp ! ” roared Gurth the Dyer , “ lest I tear thy liver ! ”</p>
   <p>“ Sit ye , here beside me , youth , ” said Jocelyn , “ and presently thou shalt know these tearers of livers and biters of hearts for lambs of innocence and doves of gentleness — by their own confessions . For , remark now , gentle boy , all we are prisoners and therefore guiltless of every offence — indeed , where is the prisoner , but who , according to himself , is not more sinned against than sinner , and where the convicted rogue but , with his tongue , shall disprove all men 's testimony ? So here sit three guileless men , spotless of soul and beyond all thought innocent of every sin soever . Yonder is Rob , a robber , and here sit I , a Fool . ”</p>
   <p>“ Ha ! ” cried Rick . “ Yet murderous Fool art thou and apt to dagger-play ! Belike hast slain a man this day in way o ’ folly — ha ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Two ! ” answered Jocelyn , nodding . “ These two had been more but that my dagger brake . ”</p>
   <p>Here was silence awhile what time Jocelyn hummed the line of a song and his companions eyed him with looks askance .</p>
   <p>“ Why then , good Folly , ” said Rick at last , “ ‘ t is for a little spilling o ’ blood art here , a little , pretty business o ’ murder — ha ? ”</p>
   <p>“ ‘ T is so they name it , ” answered Jocelyn .</p>
   <p>“ Bones o ’ me ! ” growled Will , “ I do begin to love this Fool . ”</p>
   <p>“ And didst pronounce thyself our brother , Fool ? ” questioned Gurth .</p>
   <p>“ Aye , verily ! ”</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ Then brethren let us be henceforth , and comrades to boot ! ” cried Rick .</l>

   <p>“ And by sweet Saint Nick , ” growled Will , “ the dainty youngling disporteth himself to mine eyes in a gold finger-ring ! Aha , boy ! Give now thy trinket unto an honest tanner . ”</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Hereupon and with one accord up started the three , fierce-eyed ; but</l>
     <l n="2">Jocelyn , laughing , rose up also .</l>

A dream , belike , yet in this dream she looketh on me with eyes of love and love is on her lips and in her heart — so is my dream very precious . ”</p>
   <p>At this , the youth shrank beneath his cloak while in an adjacent corner the three rolled dice with Robin and quarrelled hoarse and loud .</p>
   <p>“ Youth , ” said Jocelyn , “ I pray thee , tell me thy name . ”</p>
   <p>Without lifting head the youth answered :</p>
   <p>“ Hugo ! ”</p>
   <p>“ Look up , Hugo ! ” But Hugo bowed his head the lower .</p>
   <p>“ Hast wondrous hair , Hugo — red gold ‘ neath thy hood ! ”</p>
   <p>Here came a slim , white hand to order the rebellious tress but , finding none , trembled and hid itself . Then very suddenly Jocelyn leaned near and caught this hand , clasping it fast yet with fingers very gentle , and spake quick and eager :</p>
   <p>“ Hugo — alas , Hugo ! What bringeth thee in this evil place ? Art in danger ? Speak , speak ! ”</p>
   <p>“ Nay , here is no harm for me , Joconde . And I am hither come for sake of a poor Fool that is braver than the bravest — one did jeopardise his foolish life for sake of a maid , wherefore I , Hugo , do give him life . Take now this wallet , within is good store of gold and better — a potent charm to close all watchful eyes . Hist , Joconde , and mark me well ! Ranulph o ’ the Axe is a mighty drinker — to-night , drawn by fame of thy wit , he cometh with his fellows . This money shall buy them wine , in the wine cast this powder so shall they sleep and thou go free . ”</p>
   <p>“ Aye ! ” said Jocelyn , “ and then ? ”</p>
   <p>“ There will meet thee a dwarf shall free thee of thy fetters , and by secret ways set thee without the city — then , tarry not , but flee for thy life — ”</p>
   <p>“ Now by the Holy Rood ! ” quoth Jocelyn softly , “ never in all this world was there prisoner so happy as this poor Fool ! But , Hugo , an I win free by reason of a brave and noble lady , so long as she bide in Canalise , so long must I — ”</p>

     <l n="31">I now must get her out again .</l>
     <l n="32">“ To bide in Canalise ,' t is folly ! ” cried Hugo . “ O ,' t were a madness fond ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="33">“ Aye , ” sighed Jocelyn , “ some do call love a madness — thus mad am I ,</l>
     <l n="34">forsooth ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="35">“ Hush ! ” whispered Hugo , as from without came the tramp of heavy feet .</l>
     <l n="36">“ Fare-thee-well and — ah , be not mad , Joconde ! ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>The door creaked open , and six soldiers entered bringing a prisoner , chained and fettered , and therewith fast bound and gagged , whom they set ungently upon the stone floor ; then straightway seizing upon Robin , they haled him to his feet .</p>
   <p>“ Come , rogue , ” said one , “ thou art to hang at cockcrow ! ” “ Is't so , good fellows ? ” quoth Robin ,</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Then cock be curst</l>
     <l n="2">That croweth first !</l>
   </lg>
   <p>As for thee , good Motley , peradventure when , by hangman 's noose , our souls enfranchised go , they shall company together , thine and mine ! Till then — farewell , Folly ! ”</p>
   <p>So Robin was led forth of the dungeon and the heavy door crashed shut ; but when Jocelyn looked for Hugo — lo ! he was gone also .</p>
   <p>Evening was come and the light began to fail , therefore Jocelyn crouched beneath the narrow loophole and taking from his bosom the wallet , found therein good store of money together with the charm or philtre : and bowing his head above this little wallet , he fell to profound meditation .</p>
   <p>But presently , roused by hoarse laughter , he glanced up to find the three plaguing the helpless prisoner with sundry kicks and buffets ; so Jocelyn crossed the dungeon , and putting the tormentors aside , stood amazed to behold in this latest captive none other than Sir Pertinax . Straightway he loosed off the gag , whereupon the good knight incontinent swore a gasping oath and prayed his limbs might be loosed also ; the which done , he forthwith sprang up , and falling on the astonished three , he beat and clouted them with fist and manacles , and drave them to and fro about the dungeon .</p>
   <p>“ Ha , dogs ! Wilt spurn me with they vile feet , buffet me with thy beastly hands , forsooth ! ” roared he and kicked and cuffed them so that they , thinking him mad , cried aloud in fear until Sir Pertinax , growing a-weary , seated himself against the wall , and folding his arms , scowled indignant upon Jocelyn who greeted him merrily :</p>
   <p>“ Hail and greeting to thee , my Pertinax ; thy gloomy visage is a joy ! ”</p>
   <p>Sir Pertinax snorted , but spake not ; wherefore the Duke questioned him full blithe : “ What fair , good wind hath blown thee dungeon-wards , sweet soul ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Ha ! ” quoth the knight . “ Fetters , see'st thou , a dungeon , and these foul knaves for company — the which cometh of thy fool 's folly , messire ! So prithee ha ’ done with it ! ”</p>
   <p>“ Stay , gentle gossip , thou'rt foolish , methinks ; thou frettest ‘ gainst fate , thou kickest unwisely ‘ gainst the pricks , thou ragest pitifully ‘ gainst circumstance — in fine , thou'rt a very Pertinax , my Pertinax ! ”</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ Aye troth , that am I and no dog to lie thus chained in noisome pit , par</l>
     <l n="2">Dex ! So let us out , messire , and that incontinent ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">“ Why here is a bright thought , sweet lad , let us out forthwith — but how ? ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>“ Summon the town-reeve , messire , the burgesses , the council , declare thy rank , so shall we go free — none shall dare hold thus a prince of thy exalted state and potent might ! Declare thyself , lord . ”</p>
   <p>“ This were simple matter , Pertinax , but shall they believe us other than we seem , think ye ? ”</p>
   <p>Quoth Pertinax : “ We can try ! ”</p>
   <p>“ Verily , ” said Jocelyn , “ this very moment ! ” So saying , he turned to the three who sat in a corner muttering together .</p>
   <p>“ Good brothers , gentle rogues , ” said he , “ behold and regard well this sturdy cut-throat fellow that sitteth beside me , big of body , unseemly of habit , fierce and unlovely of look — one to yield the wall unto , see ye ! And yet — now heed me well , this fellow , ragged and unkempt , this ill-looking haunter of bye-ways , this furtive snatcher of purses ( hold thy peace , Pertinax ! ) . I say this unsavoury-seeming clapper-claw is yet neither one nor other , but a goodly knight , famous in battle , joust and tourney , a potent lord of noble heritage , known to the world as Sir Pertinax of Shene Castle and divers rich manors and demesnes . Furthermore , I that do seem a sorry jesting-fellow , I that in antic habit go , that cut ye capers with ass 's ears a-dangle and languish here your fellow in bonds , am yet no antic , no poor , motley Fool , but a duke and lord of many fair towns and rich cities beyond Morfeville and the Southward March . How say ye , brothers ? ”</p>
   <p>“ That thou'rt a fool ! ” quoth Rick .</p>
   <p>“ True ! ” nodded Jocelyn .</p>
   <p>“ Most true ! ” sighed Sir Pertinax .</p>
   <p>“ And a liar ! ” growled Gurth .</p>
   <p>“ And a murderous rogue ! ” cried Will , “ and shall hang , along of us — as I 'm a tanner ! ”</p>
   <p>“ Alack , Sir Knight , ” smiled Jocelyn , “ of what avail rank or fame or both ‘ gainst a motley habit and a ragged mantle . Thus , Pertinax , thou art no more than what thou seemest , to wit — a poor , fierce rogue , and I , a beggarly stroller . ”</p>
   <p>“ And like to have our necks stretched , lord , by reason of a fond and foolish whim ! ”</p>
   <p>“ Unless , Pertinax , having naught to depend on but our native wit we , by our wit , win free . Other poor rogues in like case have broke prison ere now , and ‘ tis pity and shame in us if thou , a knight so potent and high-born , and I , a prince , may not do the like . ”</p>
   <p>“ Messire , unlearned am I in the breaking o ’ prisons so when my time cometh to die in a noose I can but die as knight should — though I had rather ‘ t were in honest fight . ”</p>
   <p>“ Spoken like the very fool of a knight ! ” quoth Jocelyn . “ So now will I show thee how by the wit of a brave and noble lady we may yet ‘ scape the hangman . Hearken in thine ear ! ”</p>
   <p>But , when Jocelyn had told him all and shown money and sleeping-charm , Sir Pertinax grew thoughtful , sighing deep and oft , yet speaking not , wherefore the Duke questioned him .</p>
   <p>“ Good gossip , gasp not ! ” quoth he . “ How think'st thou of prison-breaking now — expound ! ”</p>
   <p>“ Why , sir , I think when all do charmed and spellbound snore , Then will we shrewdly choke them that they wake no more ! ”</p>
   <p>“ Nay , Pertinax , here shall be no need of choking , forsooth ! ” Sir Pertinax bowed chin on fist and sighed again .</p>
   <p>“ Pertinax , prithee puff not ! Yet , an puff ye will , pronounce me then the why and wherefore of thy puffing . ”</p>
   <p>“ Lord , here is neither gasp nor puff , here is honest sighing . I can sigh as well as another . ”</p>
   <p>“ Since when hast learned this so tender art , my Pertinax ? ”</p>
   <p>“ And I do sigh by reason of memory . ”</p>
   <p>“ As what , Pertinax ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Eyes , lord — her eyes so darkly bright and , as I do think — black ! ”</p>
   <p>“ Nay , blue , Pertinax — blue as heaven ! ”</p>
   <p>“ Black , messire , black as — as black ! ”</p>
   <p>“ Blue , boy , blue ! ”</p>
   <p>“ Lord , they are black ! ”</p>
   <p>“ Speak'st thou of Yolande ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Messire , of one I speak , but whom , I know not . She came to me i ’ the greenwood as I sat a-fishing . Her hair long and black — ay , black and curled , her eyes dark , and for beauty ne'er saw I her like . ”</p>
   <p>“ And yet hast seen my Lady Yolande oft ! ”</p>
   <p>“ Her voice , messire , her voice soft and sweet as the murmur of waters , and very full of allure . ”</p>
   <p>“ Why , how now ! ” cried Jocelyn . “ Art thou — thou , my Pertinax , become at last one of Cupid 's humble following ? All joy to thee , my lovely lover — here in truth is added bond betwixt us ! For since thou dost love a maid , even as I do love a maid , so being lovers twain needs must we love each other the better therefore . ”</p>
   <p>“ Nay , out alack , my lord ! ” sighed Sir Pertinax . “ For though I do love her , she , by reason o ’ my ill-favoured looks , the which , woe 's me , I may not alter , loveth not me , as I do judge . ”</p>
   <p>“ How judge ye this ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Lord , she giveth me hard names . She , all in a breath , hath pictured me thus : ‘ Hooked of nose , fierce-eyed , of aspect grim — ungentle , unlovely , harsh o ’ tongue , dour o ’ visage , hard o ’ heart , flinty o ’ soul and of manners rude . ’ ”</p>
   <p>“ Good ! But was this all , my Pertinax ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Nay , lord , and with a wannion — there was more to like purpose . ”</p>
   <p>“ Excellent , my lovely knight — let hope sing in thee . For look now , if she named thee hooked of nose , fierce-eyed and of aspect grim — she speaketh very truth , for so thou art , my Pertinax . Now truth is a fair virtue in man or maid , so is she both virtuous and fair ! Nay , puff not , sighful Pertinax , but for thy comforting mark this — she hath viewed and heeded thy outward man narrowly — so shall she not forget thee soon ; she with woman 's eye hath marked the great heart of thee through sorry habit and rusty mail , and found therein the love thy harsh tongue might not utter ; and thus , methinks , she hath thee in mind — aye , even now , mayhap . Lastly , good , lovely blunderbore — mark this ! ‘ Tis better to win a maid 's anger than she should heed thee none at all . Let love carol i ’ thy heart and be ye worthy , so , when ye shall meet again , ‘ tis like enough , despite thy hooked nose , she shall find thine eyes gentle , thy unloveliness lovely , thy harsh tongue wondrous tender and thy flinty soul the soul of a man . ”</p>
   <p>“ Why , faith , lord , ” quoth Pertinax , his grim lips softening to a smile , “ despite her words , she spake in voice full sweet , and her eyes — ah , messire , her eyes were wondrous kind — gentle eyes — aye , her eyes were — ”</p>
   <p>“ Eyes , my Pertinax — black eyes ! ”</p>
   <p>“ And gentle ! By which same token , lord , she did give to me this token — this most strange trinket . ”</p>
   <p>But all at once , was the creak of hinges , and the ponderous door opening , Ranulph o ’ the Axe appeared , followed by divers of the warders bearing torches .</p>
   <p>“ Oho ! ” sighed Ranulph , doleful of visage . “ Aha , good bawcocks , here come I , and these my fellows , for love o ’ thee , good Fool , thy quips , thy quirks , thy songs and antics capersome . For troth I 'm a merry dog , I — a wanton wag , a bully boy and jovial , though woeful o ’ look ! ”</p>
   <p>“ Wherefore woeful ! ”</p>
   <p>“ For that I am not joyous , good Motley . Look ‘ ee — here 's me born with a rare , merry heart , but sad and sober of head ! Here 's a heart bubbling with kindliness and soft and tender as sucking lamb , wedded to head and face full o ’ gloom ! Here 's laughter within me and woe without me , so am I ever at odds with myself — and there 's my sorrow . Regarding the which same I will now chaunt ye song I made on myself ; ‘ twas meant for merry song and blithe , but of itself turned mournful song anon as ye shall hear . ”</p>
   <p>So saying , Ranulph o ’ the Axe threw back grim head and sang gruff , albeit plaintive , thus :</p>

   <p>“ So there 's my song ! ‘ T is dull song and , striving to be merry song , is sad song , yet might be worse song , for I have heard a worse song , ere now — but ‘ t is poor song . So come , Fool , do thou sing us merry song to cheer us ‘ gainst my sad song . ”</p>
   <p>“ Why truly , Sir Headsman , ” said Jocelyn , “ here be songs a-many , yet if thou ‘ rt for songs , songs will we sing thee , each and every of us . But first , behold here is money shall buy us wine in plenty that we may grow merry withal in very sooth . ”</p>
   <p>“ Oho ! ” cried Ranulph . “ Spoken like a noble Motley , a fair , sweet Fool ! Go thou , Bertram , obey this lord-like Fool — bring wine , good wine and much , and haste thee , for night draweth on and at cock-crow I must away . ”</p>
   <p>“ Aye , ” nodded Jocelyn , “ in the matter of one — Robin ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Verily , Fool . A cheery soul is Robin , though an outlaw , and well beloved in Canalise . So is he to hang at cock-crow lest folk make disturbance . ”</p>
   <p>“ Where lieth he now ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Where but in the watch-house beside the gallows ‘ neath Black Lewin 's charge . But come , good Motley , sing — a pretty song , a merry ditty , ha ! ”</p>

For look ‘ ee now , if I set these three rogues free , how may I hang ‘ em as hang ‘ em I must , since I by hanging live to hang again , and if I do n't hang ‘ em whom shall I hang since hang I must , I being hangman ?

   <p>“ Why then , mark ye this , hangman , ” said Jocelyn , “ since on hanging doth thy hangman 's reputation hang , then hang thou must ; therefore , an ye lack rogue to hang , go hang thyself , so , hanging , shall thy hanging be done with and thou having lived a hangman , hangman die , thus , hangman hanging hangman , hangman hanging shall be hangman still , and being still , thus hanging , shall hang no more . ”</p>

   <p>Hereupon the scurvy knaves were freed , to their great joy , and following the bold knight , made haste to quit their gloomy dungeon . Reaching the guardroom above , Sir Pertinax called lustily for sword and bascinet , and thereafter chose divers likely weapons for his companions who , with axe and pike and guisarme on shoulder , followed him out into the free air .</p>
   <p>Now it was night and very dark , but Gurth , who was a man of the town , brought them by dim and lonely alleys and crooked ways until at last they halted within a certain dark and narrow street .</p>

   <p>At this , Jocelyn sat up and wondered to find himself in a small chamber dim-lit by a smoking cresset . On one side of him leaned an ancient woman , a very hag-like dame</p>

     <l n="1">With long , sharp nose that downward curved as though</l>

    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Very heedfully , Jocelyn unbarred the door , and peering into the narrow street , found it deserted and empty save for certain outstretched forms that stirred not ; looking down on these dim shapes he knew one for Rick the Ploughman , whose ploughing days were sped and , huddled in a corner hard by , he found Will the Tanner , who groaned fitfully ; but of Sir Pertinax and Gurth he saw nothing . So Jocelyn made shift to bear the Tanner within the house , and here Will , finding his hurts of small account , sat up , and while the wise old woman bandaged his wound , answered Jocelyn 's eager questions , and told how Sir Pertinax and Gurth the Dyer had broken through their assailants and made good their escape .</p>
   <p>Now , when the old woman had thus cherished their hurts , Jocelyn would fain have given her money , but she mumbled and mowed and cracked her finger-joints and shook grey head .</p>
   <p>“ Not so , good Fool ! ” she croaked , “ for I do know thee for that same gentle Motley did save me from Black Lewin — a murrain seize him ! So now will I save thee — behold ! ” So saying she set bony hand to wall ; and lo ! in the wall yawned a square opening narrow and dark , whence issued a cold wind . “ Begone , thou brave merryman ! ” quoth she . “ Yonder safety lieth ; this darksome way shall carry thee out beneath the city wall ! ”</p>
   <p>“ Gramercy , thou kindly Witch ! ” said Jocelyn . “ Yet first must I to the watch-house beside the gate for one Robin that lieth ‘ prisoned there . ”</p>
   <p>“ How , Fool , dost mean Robin-a-Green that is to hang ? ”</p>
   <p>“ In truth ! ”</p>
   <p>“ But Rob o ’ the Green is outlawed , banned o ’ Church , a very rogue ! ”</p>
   <p>“ But a man , wherefore I would save him alive . ”</p>
   <p>“ Nay , Fool , o ’ thy folly be wise and seek ye safety instead . Would'st peril thy body for a thief ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Verily , dame , even as I did for a Witch . ”</p>
   <p>Now , here the old woman scowled and mumbled and cracked her finger-bones angrily . But the beauteous young maid viewed Jocelyn with bright , approving eyes :</p>
   <p>“ But , Fool , ” cried she , “ O wondrous Fool , wilt adventure thyself in cause so desperate ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Blithely , fair lady ! ”</p>
   <p>“ But , alas ! the guards be many and thou but one — ”</p>
   <p>“ Nay ! ” cried a voice :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ For thou may'st see</l>
     <l n="2">That two are we ! ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>And forth of the dark opening in the wall strode Lobkyn Lollo the Dwarf , his great , spiked club on brawny shoulder . Jocelyn viewed the monstrous little man in awed wonder ; but beholding his mighty girth and determined aspect , wonder changed to kindliness ; quoth he :</p>
   <p>“ Fair greeting , comrade ! If thou'rt for a little bickering and disputation with that goodly club o ’ thine , come thy ways for methinks I do smell the dawn . ”</p>
   <p>“ Aha , thou naughty little one ! ” cried the Witch , shaking bony fist . “ Art for fighting for rogue 's life along of a Fool , then ? ”</p>
   <p>Quoth LOBKYN :</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Aye , grannam , though ye slap me , still ,</l>
     <l n="2">Fight and aid this Fool I will —</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">“ And talking o ’ Will , ” quoth Will , “ what o ’ me , for though I 'm a tanner I 'm</l>
     <l n="4">a man , aye , verily , as I 'm a tanner . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="5">“ And methinks a better man than tanner ! ” said Jocelyn . “ So here we stand</l>
     <l n="6">three goodly wights and well armed . Let 's away — ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>“ Nay , then , wild Madcap , ” croaked the Witch , “ an my Lobkyn go I go , and , though I be old and feeble , shalt find my craft more potent than sword or club — wait ! ”</p>
   <p>Here the old woman , opening a dingy cupboard , took thence a small crock over which she muttered spells and incantations with look and gesture so evil that Lobkyn eyed her askance , Will the Tanner cowered and whispered fragments of prayers , and even Jocelyn crossed himself .</p>
   <p>“ Come ! ” croaked the Witch . “ Now do I go to save rogue from gallows for sake of thee , tall Fool . Come ye , come and do as I bid ye in all things — come ! ”</p>

   <p>Thus cheerily sang Robin the while he dried his bitter tears , as the door of his prison was flung wide and Black Lewin strode in and with him men-at-arms bearing torches .</p>
   <p>“ What ho , rogue Robin ! ” cried he . “ The cock hath crowed . Ha ! Will ye sing , knave , will ye sing , in faith ? ”</p>
   <p>“ In faith , that will I ! ” laughed Robin .</p>
   <p>“ Here come we to bring ye to the gallows , Robin — how say ye ? ”</p>
   <p>“ The more reason for singing since my singing must soon be done ! ” So , with pikemen before him and behind , bold Robin marched forth to die , yet sang full blithely as he went :</p>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">

     <l n="5">“ Ha ’ done ! ” growled Black Lewin , shivering in the chilly air of dawn .</l>
     <l n="6">“ Quit — quit thy singing , rogue , or by the foul fiend I — ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>“ Who dareth name the fiend ? ” croaked an awful voice , whereat Black Lewin halted , gaped and stood a-tremble , while beneath steel cap and bascinet all men 's hair stirred and rose with horror ; for before them was a ghastly shape , a shape that crouched in the gloom with dreadful face aflame with smouldering green fire .</p>
   <p>“ Woe ! ” cried the voice . “ Woe unto thee , Lewin the Black , that calleth on fiend o ’ the pit ! ”</p>
   <p>And now came a fiery hand that , hovering in the air , pointed lambent finger at gaping Lewin and at each of the shivering pike-men in turn .</p>
   <p>“ Woe — sorrow and woe to one and all , ye men of blood , plague and pest , pain o ’ flesh , and grief of soul seize ye , be accursed and so — begone ! Hence ho — away !</p>

   <p>Down fell pike and guisarme from nerveless fingers and , gasping with fear , Black Lewin and his fellows turned and fled nor stayed for one look behind ; only Robin stood there ( since he might not run away by reason of his bonds ) babbling prayers between chattering teeth and with all his fingers crossed .</p>
   <p>“ Oho , Fool , aha ! ” cried the voice . “ Thus have I , a poor , feeble old woman , wrought better than all thy valiance or Lobkyn 's strength . So , by potency of my spells and magic are we quits , thou and I . Bring , then , thy rogue outlaw and haste ye ! ”</p>
   <p>So saying the old Witch muffled her awful , fiery face in ragged mantle and turned away ; and in that moment Robin was aware of three forms about him in the grey dawn-light , felt his bonds loosed off by quick , strong hands and drew a great , joyous breath .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ How , Fool , thou brave and noble Motley , ” quoth he , “ is it thou again ? And</l>

   </lg>
   <p>So with the Tanner on one side and Lobkyn on the other , Robin ran , hard on Jocelyn 's heels ; and ever the dawn brightened until up came the sun chasing away sullen shadow and filling street and alley with his glory .</p>
   <p>But now , and just as they reached that narrow street where safety lay , they heard a shout , a scream , a rush of feet and roar of fierce voices and beheld , amid a surge of armed men , the old woman struggling in the cruel grip of Black Lewin who ( like many others I wot of , my Gill ) was brave enough by daylight . Vainly the old creature strove , screaming for mercy as Black Lewin whirled aloft his sword ; but his blade clashed upon another as Jocelyn sprang , and for a while the air rang with the sound of fierce - smiting steel until , throwing up his arms , Black Lewin fell and lay there . But , roaring vengeance , the soldiery closed about Jocelyn who , beset by blows on every side , sank in turn , yet , even as he fell , two short though mighty legs bestrode his prostrate form and Lobkyn Lollo , whirling huge club , smote down the foremost assailant and , ever as he smote , he versified and chanted — thus :</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">

     <l n="9">And where they light</l>
     <l n="10">‘ Tis sorry plight</l>

     <l n="19">Or , when ye die ,</l>
     <l n="20">Then may old Horny take ye . ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Fierce raged the conflict , but in that narrow street they made good play against their many assailants , the valiant Dwarf 's mighty club , backed by the Tanner 's darting pike and Robin 's flashing sword , which he had snatched from a loosened grasp . But Jocelyn lay prone upon his face , between Lobkyn 's firm-planted feet , and stirred not . So club whirled , sword flashed and pike darted while , high above the tumult , rose Lobkyn 's fierce chant :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Hot blood I quaff ,</l>
     <l n="2">At death I laugh ,</l>
     <l n="3">Brave Lobkyn Lollo , I .</l>
     <l n="4">Come all that may ,</l>
     <l n="5">And all I 'll slay ,</l>
     <l n="6">And teach ye how to die . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>“ Lob — Lobkyn ! ” screamed the Witch . “ Thou that drinkest nought but milk — talk not of blood , thou naughty poppet . Back now — stand back , I do command thee ! ”</p>
   <p>Lobkyn smote a man to earth and , sighing regretful , stepped aside .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ Back ! ” screamed the Witch . “ Stand back , I say , all three ,</l>
     <l n="2">And leave this wicked rabblement to me .</l>
     <l n="3">Now shall they learn the terror of my curse ,</l>
     <l n="4">Black magic shall they feel — and something worse ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">Then uttered she a sudden , hideous cry ,</l>
     <l n="6">And , leaping , whirled her bony hands on high ,</l>
     <l n="7">And lo ! a choking dust-cloud filled the air ;</l>
     <l n="8">That wreathed in whirling eddies here and there .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">“ Perendewix ! ” she cried . “ Oh Radzywin —</l>
     <l n="10">Thraxa ! Behold , my witchcraft doth begin ! ”</l>
     <l n="11">Back shrank their foes , back reeled they one and all ,</l>
     <l n="12">They choked , they gasped , they let their weapons fall ;</l>
     <l n="13">And some did groan , and some did fiercely sneeze ,</l>
     <l n="14">And some fell prone , some writhed upon their knees ;</l>
     <l n="15">Some strove to wipe the tears from blinded eyes ,</l>
     <l n="16">But one and all gave voice to awful cries .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>“ Come ! ” cried the Witch , “ to the door — the door . Lobkyn , bear ye the brave Fool — and tenderly ! Haste , naughty bantling , haste — I hear the tread of more soldiers ! ”</p>
   <p>So Lobkyn stooped and , lifting Jocelyn 's inanimate form , tucked it beneath one arm , and with Robin and Will the Tanner , followed the old Witch into the house .</p>

     <l n="3">With sleepy eyes Duke Jocelyn watched afar ,</l>
     <l n="4">In deep , blue void a solitary star ,</l>
     <l n="5">That , like some bright and wakeful eye , did seem</l>
     <l n="6">To watch him where he lay ‘ twixt sleep and dream .</l>
     <l n="7">And , as he viewed it winking high above ,</l>
     <l n="8">He needs must think of Yolande and his love ,</l>

     <l n="10">She , wakeful lying , might behold it too ,</l>

     <l n="14">Then frowned to hear a lusty snore hard by —</l>

   </lg>
   <p>— and looking whence came this sound , the Duke sat up and his wonder grew ; for by light of a fire that glowed in a blackened fissure of rock he beheld himself couched on a bed of bracken within a roomy cave . Beside the fire leaned a mighty , iron-shod club , and beyond this , curled up like a dog , snored Lobkyn Lollo , the Dwarf . Hereupon Jocelyn reached out and shook Lob to wakefulness , who grunted sleepily , rubbed his eyes drowsily and yawned mightily :</p>

   <p>Hereupon the Dwarf laid finger to lip and uttered an owl-cry so dismal , so tremulous and withal so true to nature that it was wonder to hear . Instantly , from the dimness beyond the cavern-mouth , the cry was repeated , and presently was heard a panting and ‘ plaining , a snuffling and a shuffling , and into the light of the fire hobbled the old Witch . Beholding Jocelyn sitting cross-legged on his couch of fern , she paused and , leaning on her crooked stick , viewed him with her wise , old eyes .</p>
   <p>“ Aha , Motley ! ” she croaked . “ Oho , thou flaunting jackanapes , didst peril thy foolish flesh for me that am poor and old and feeble , and cursed by all for witchcraft ! So have I with my potions ministered to thee in thy sickness , and behold thou'rt alive , hale and strong again . Give me thy hand ! Aha , here 's cool , unfevered blood ! Show me thy tongue . Oho ! Aha ! A little sup o ’ my black decoction — roots gathered at full o ’ moon — a little sup and shall be thyself by to-morrow 's dawn . But — as for thee , thou good-for-naught , thou wicked elf — aha ! would'st dare leave thy poor old grannam weak and ‘ fenceless ? Give me thy rogue-ear ! ” Obediently , the mighty Dwarf arose and sighfully suffered the old woman to grasp him by the ear and to tweak and wring and twist it as she would .</p>
   <p>“ What dost thou here i ’ the wild-wood , thou imp , thou poppet o ’ plagues , thou naughty wap-de-staldees ? ”</p>

    </lg>

   <p>Saying which , she proceeded to belabour the poor Dwarf with her knotted stick , clutching him fast by his ear the while . Thus she be-thwacked him soundly until he roared for mercy .</p>
   <p>“ Why , how now — how now ? ” cried a merry voice , and Robin strode into the firelight . “ Gentle Witch , sweet dame , ” quoth he , “ what do ye with poor Lob ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Thwack him shrewdly ! ”</p>
   <p>“ Which is , Witch , that which none but witch the like o ’ thee might do , for lustier fighter and mightier dwarf never was .

   <p>“ Ha , forest-rogue , ‘ tis a bad brat , a very naughty elf would run off into the wild to be rogue like thee — an outlaw , forsooth ! ”</p>
   <p>“ Forsooth , Witch , ” laughed Robin , “ outlaw is he in very truth , in sooth and by my troth ! Outlaw is Lob , banned by Church and Council of Ten , and so proclaimed i ’ the market square of Canalise this very morn by sound o ’ trumpet and — ”</p>
   <p>“ How ? How ? ” cried the old woman , wringing her trembling hands . “ My Lobkyn outlawed ? My babe , my lovely brat , my pretty bantling , woe and alas ! My dear ugly one an outlaw ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Aye , marry is he , Witch , outlaw proclaimed , acclaimed , announced , pronounced and denounced ; as such described , ascribed and proscribed by Master Gregory Bax , the port-reeve , for the late slaying and maiming of divers of the city guard . So outlaw is Lobkyn , his life henceforth forfeit even as mine . ”</p>
   <p>“ My Lobkyn an hairy outlaw i ’ the wild-wood ! Out alas ! And what of his poor old grannam ? What o ’ me —? ”</p>
   <p>“ Content thee , sweet hag , since thou'rt outlawed along with him and , as witch , doomed to die unpleasantly by fire and flame and faggot , if thou'rt caught . ”</p>

   <p>“ Hight Robin ! ” laughed Robin , leaning on his long bow-stave . “ Now , this brave Fool having saved Robin his life , Witch , the which , Witch , was good thing for Robin , our Fool next saved thee , Witch , which was nought to Robin , in the which , Witch , Robin did not joy ; for thou , old Witch , being witch , art therefore full o ’ witcheries which be apt to be-devil a man and fright his reason , for the which reason , being reasonable man , I reason , for this reason , that , so reasoning , I love thee not . But thou art old , Witch , which is good reason to reasonably reason thou art wise , Witch , and , being wise , I on this wise would seek counsel of thy wisdom , Witch . Imprimis , then — ”</p>

   <p>“ Nay , then , Robin-a-Green , suffer me to rest my old bones whiles thy mill clacks . ” Hereupon the old Witch seated herself beside the fire , with bony knees up-drawn to bony chin . “ Speak , outlaw Robin , ” she croaked , blinking her red eyes , “ and speak ye plain . ”</p>
   <p>“ Why , then , wise Witch , look ‘ ee : since we be outlaws each and every , with all men 's hands against us , with none to succour , and death watchful for us , ‘ tis plain , and very plain , we , for our harbourage and defence , must in the wild-wood bide — ”</p>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="10">“ Roar not , toad ! ” cried the Witch . “ Say on — Rogue-Robin ! ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>“ Why , mark me , good Witch , here 's where buskin chafeth ! Not long since I ruled i ’ the wild-wood , a very king , with ten-score lusty outlaw-rogues to do my will . To-day is there never an one , and for this reasonable reason — to wit , I am hanged , and , being hanged , am dead , and , being dead , am not , and thus Robin is nobody ; and yet again , perceive me , Witch , being Robin , I am therefore somebody ; thus is nobody somebody , and yet somebody that nobody will believe anybody . The which , Witch , is a parlous case , methinks , for here am I , somebody , nobody and Robin altogether and at the same time ; therefore , Witch , o ’ thy witchful wisdom — who am I , what and which , Witch ? ”</p>
   <p>Here the Witch blinked and mowed , and cracked her finger-bones one after another . Quoth she :</p>
   <p>“ For thy first , thou'rt thyself ; for the second , a rogue ; and for the third , a wind-bag . I would thy second might tie up thy first in thy third . ”</p>
   <p>“ So should Robin choke Robin with Robin . But hark ‘ ee again , good , patient dame . It seemeth that Ranulph the executioner betaketh him at cock-crow to hang poor me ; but , finding me not , made great outcry , insomuch that the city guard , such as mighty Lob and Will had left alive , sought counsel together ; and taking one of their slain fellows , Ranulph hanged him in my stead , and there he hangeth now , above the city gate , his face so marred that he might be me or any other . ”</p>
   <p>“ Ha , Robin — well ? ”</p>
   <p>“ This day , at sunset , came I unto the trysting-oak , and by blast of horn summoned me my outlaw company . They came apace and in great wonderment , for , seeing me , they fell to great awe and dread , thinking me dead , since many had seen my body a-dangle on the gallows ; wherefore , seeing me manifestly alive , they took me for ghoulish ghost ‘ stead o ’ good flesh and blood , and fled from me amain . So , by reason of my dead body , that is no body o ’ mine , yet that nobody will believe is no body o ’ mine , they believe that this my body is yet no body , but a phantom ; the which is out of reason ; yet thus unreasonably do the rogues reason by reason of the body that hangeth in place of my body above the city gate . Wherefore I reason there is yet reason in their unreason , seeing this body was somebody , yet no body o ’ mine , but which nobody among them can swear to . Which , Witch , is a matter which none but wise witch may counsel me in . How say'st thou , Witch ? ”</p>
   <p>But for a while the old Witch scowled on the fire , bony chin on bony knees , and dreamily cracked her finger-joints .</p>
   <p>“ Oho ! ” she cried suddenly . “ Aha — a body that nobody 's is , yet body that everybody knoweth for body o ’ thine — aha ! So must nobody know that nobody 's body is not thy body . Dost see my meaning , Robin-a-Green ? ”</p>
   <p>“ No whit , Witch ! Thou growest involved , thy talk diffuse , abstruse and altogether beyond one so obtuse as simple Rob — ”</p>
   <p>“ Then hark ‘ ee again , Addlepate ! Everybodymust believe nobody 's body thy body , so by dead body will I make thy live body of so great account to everybody that nobody henceforth shall doubt dead body made live body , by my witchcraft , and thou be feared , therefore , of everybody . Dost follow me now , numskull ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Aye , truly , mother ! And truly ‘ tis a rare subtlety , a notable wile , and thou a right cunning witch and wise . But how wilt achieve this wonder ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Since dead thou art , I to life will bring thee . Oho , I will summon thee through fire and flame ; aha , I will make thee more dreaded than heretofore ; thy fame shall fill the wild-wood and beyond . Know'st thou the Haunted Wood , hard by Thraxby Waste ? ”</p>
   <p>Now here Robin 's merry smile languished , and he rubbed nose with dubious finger .</p>
   <p>“ Aye , I do , ” quoth he sombrely ; “ an ill place and — demon-rid , they say — ”</p>
   <p>“ Come ye there to-morrow at midnight . ”</p>
   <p>“ Alone ? ” says Robin , starting .</p>
   <p>“ Alone ! ”</p>
   <p>“ Nay , good Witch , most gentle , potent dame , I — though phantom accounted , I love not phantoms , and Thraxby Waste — ”</p>

   <p>Deep-hidden in the trackless wild the outlaws had made them a haven of refuge , a camp remote and well sequestered . Here were mossy , fern-clad rocks that soared aloft , and here green lawns where ran a blithesome brook ; it was indeed a very pleasant place shut in by mighty trees . Within this leafy boskage stood huts of wattle , cunningly wrought ; beneath the steep were many caves carpeted with dried fern and fragrant mosses , while everywhere , above and around , the trees spread mighty boughs , through which the sun darted golden beams be-dappling the sward , and in whose leafy mysteries the birds made joyous carolling .</p>
   <p>And here beneath bending willows arched over this merry brook , one sun-bright morning riotous with song of birds , sat Jocelyn with Robin a-sprawl beside him .</p>
   <p>“ O brother , ” says Robin , “ O brother , ‘ t is a fair place the greenwood , a fair , sweet place to live — aye , or to die in methinks , this good greenwood , whereof I have made a song — hark ‘ ee ! ”</p>

   <p>“ As how , Sir Outlaw ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Marry , on this wise — when man 's in love he mopeth apart and is ill company , so is he out o ’ friends ; he hangeth humble head abashed , so is he out o ’ countenance ; he uttereth frequent , windy , sighful suspirations , so is he out o ’ breath ; he lavisheth lucre on his love , so is he out o ’ pocket ; he forsweareth food , despiseth drink , scorneth sleep , so is he out o ’ health — in fine , he is out of all things , so is he out of himself ; therefore he is mad , and so may go hang himself ! ”</p>

   <p>MELISSA : If thy love for Love be true love , so shall Love love thee true .</p>
   <p>ROBIN : Then if Love should love me for my sake , then would I love Love for Love 's sake ; but since Love ne'er hath sought me for my sake , ne'er will I seek Love for Love 's sake for my sake , since Love , though plaguy sweet , is a sweet plague , I judge and , so judging , will by my judgment stand .</p>
   <p>MELISBA : And how think you , Sir Fool ?</p>
   <p>JOCELYN : I think if Love find Robin and Robin , so found of Love , shall learn to love Love for Love 's sake , Love shall teach Robin how , hi loving Love — Love , if a plague , doth but plague him lovingly to his better judgment of Love , till , being on this wise , wise — he shall judge of Love lovingly , loving Love at last for Love 's own lovely sake , rather than for his own selfish self . For as there is the passion of love , the which is a love selfish , so there is the true Spirit of Love , the which forgetteth self in Love 's self , thus , self-forgotten , Love is crowned by Love 's true self .</p>
   <p>MELISSA : How think ye of this , Robin ?</p>
   <p>ROBIN : By Cupid , we are so deep in love that we are like to drown of love and we be not wary . Here hath my lovely jowlopped-crested brother so beset poor Robin with Love and self and Robin , that Robin kens not which is Love , Love 's self or himself .</p>

   <p>And he pointed where the old creature hobbled towards them bent on her crooked staff . Up rose Robin and , hasting to meet her , louted full low , since she was held in great respect of all men by reason of her potent spells . Chuckling evilly , she drew down Robin 's tall head to whisper in his ear , whereupon he laughed , clapped hand to brawny thigh , and taking old Mopsa 's feeble arm , hastened away with her .

   <p>JOCELYN : One doubtless will , lady .</p>
   <p>MELISSA : Thyself ?</p>
   <p>JOCELYN : Nay — one that loveth the disputatious bickering of sharp steel better than I — one had rather fight than eat , and rather fight three men than one —</p>
   <p>“ Three men ? ” cried Melissa , starting .</p>
   <p>“ Aye , lady — and six men than three ! ”</p>
   <p>“ There was such an one , Fool , in truth a very brave man , did fight three of my Lord Agramore 's foresters on my behalf . Dost know of such an one , Fool ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Methinks he is my comrade , Lady . ”</p>
   <p>“ Thy comrade — in truth ? Then , pray you , speak me what seeming hath he . ”</p>
   <p>“ Ill , lady . ”</p>
   <p>“ How so , Fool ? ”</p>
   <p>“ A great , fierce rogue is he , unlovely of look , bleak of eye , harsh of tongue , hooked of nose , flinty of soul , stony of heart , of aspect grim and manners rude ! ”</p>
   <p>“ Then , verily , thy comrade have I never seen ! ” quoth Melissa , flushing and with head up-flung . “ He that saved me is nothing the like of this . ”</p>
   <p>“ And yet , ” said Jocelyn slyly , “ ‘ tis thus he hath been named ere now ! ”</p>
   <p>“ Nay , Fool , indeed he that saved me was tall and seemly man , very fierce and strong in fight , but to me wondrous gentle — in truth , something timorous , and , ‘ spite rusty mail , spake and looked like a noble knight . ”</p>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="16">“ Ah ! ” said Melissa , frowning blacker than ever . “ A maid , Fool ? What maid ? ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="17">“ A wandering gipsy o ’ the wood , lady — a dark-eyed damsel with long , black</l>
     <l n="18">curling hair and ‘ voice of sweet allure ’ — ‘ tis so he named her — ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="19">“ This was belike some wicked witch ! ” said Melissa , clenching white fist .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>“ Aye , belike it was , lady , for she bestowed on him a strange jewel , a heart in heart of crystal , that wrought for us in Canalise marvels great as our wondrous Witch herself . ”</p>
   <p>Now here the lovely Melissa 's frown vanished , and her red lips curved to sudden smile .</p>
   <p>“ Belike this was no witch after all ! ” said she gently .</p>
   <p>“ Howbeit , lady , ” quoth Jocelyn slyly , “ my poor comrade is surely bewitched by her none the less . She hath wrought on him spell so potent that he groweth mopish and talketh of her eyes , her hair , her sweet and gentle voice , her little foot , forsooth . ”</p>
   <p>“ And doth he so , indeed ? ” said Melissa softly , and , twiddling one of her own pretty feet , she smiled at it . “ Doth he sigh o'er much ? ” she questioned .</p>
   <p>“ Consumedly ! By the minute ! ”</p>
   <p>“ Poor soldier ! ” she murmured .</p>
   <p>“ Aye , poor rogue ! ” said Jocelyn ; whereupon she frowned again , and turned her back upon him .</p>
   <p>“ And he is thy comrade . ”</p>
   <p>“ Even so — poor knave ! ”</p>
   <p>“ And destitute — even as thou ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Aye , a sorry clapper-claw — even as I , lady . ”</p>
   <p>“ Then , pray thee , why doth he wear gold chain about his neck ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Chain , lady —? ”</p>
   <p>“ Such as only knights do wear ! ”</p>
   <p>“ Belike he stole it , lady — ”</p>
   <p>“ Aye — belike he did ! ” said she , rising ; then she sighed and laughed , and so turned and left him .</p>
   <p>And in a while Jocelyn rose also , and went on beside the brook ; but as he walked deep in thought , there met him Robin , he full of mirth and laughter .</p>
   <p>“ Oho , brother , good brother ! ” cried he joyfully , clapping hand on Jocelyn 's broad shoulder , “ come away , now , and see what the good wind hath blown hither — come thy ways and see ! ”</p>
   <p>So came they where rose a great tree of huge girth , whose gnarled branches spread far and wide , a veryforest of leaves , beneath whose shade were many of the outlaws grouped about one who crouched miserably on his knees , his arms fast bound and a halter about his neck ; and , as obedient to Robin 's words the fierce company fell back , Jocelyn saw this torn and pallid captive was none other than Ranulph the Hangman .</p>
   <p>“ Woe 's me , my masters ! ” quoth he ‘ twixt chattering teeth . “ ‘ Tis pity poor Ranulph must die before his time , for ne'er shall be found hangman , headsman or torturer the like o ’ Ranulph — so dainty i ’ the nice adjustment o ’ noose ! So clean and delicate wi ’ the axe ! So tender and thoughtful wi ’ pincers , thumbscrew , rack or red-hot iron ! A hangman so kindly o ’ soul , so merry o ’ heart , alack , so free , so gay , so merry — forsooth a very wanton , waggish , jovial bawcock-lad — ”</p>
   <p>“ Why , then , good , merry wag , ” laughed Robin , “ now shalt thou cut us an antic aloft in air , shalt caper and dance in noose to our joyance ! Up with him , bully lads , and gently , that he may dance the longer ! ”</p>
   <p>But as Ranulph was dragged , shivering , to his feet , Jocelyn stepped forward .</p>
   <p>“ Stay ! ” he cried . “ Look , now , here 's hangman did but hang since hang he must ; must he hang therefore ? ”</p>
   <p>ROBIN : Aye , marry , since hanging shall his hanging end !</p>
   <p>JOCELYN : But if to hang his duty is , must he for duty hang ? Moreover , if ye hang this hangman , unhanged hangmen shall hang still , and since ye may not all hangmen hang , wherefore should this hangman hang ?</p>
   <p>ROBIN : Brother , an this hangman hang , fewer hangmen shall there be to hang , forsooth .</p>
   <p>JOCELYN : Not so , Robin , for hangman dead begetteth hangman new ; this hangman hanged , hangman in his place shall hang men after him . Shall this hangman hang for hanging as in duty bound , whiles other hangmen , unhanged , hang still ? Here , methinks , is small wisdom , little reason , and less of justice , Robin .</p>
   <p>ROBIN : Beshrew me , brother — but here 's so much of hanging hanging on hanging plaguy hangman that hang me if I get the hang o n't —</p>
   <p>JOCELYN : Plainly , Robin — wilt hang a man for doing his duty ?</p>
   <p>ROBIN : Plainly , brother — no . But —</p>
   <p>JOCELYN : Then canst not hang this hangman , since hanging his duty is —</p>
   <p>ROBIN : Yet ‘ tis base , vile duty —</p>
   <p>JOCELYN : Yet duty it is — wherefore , an there be any justice in the good greenwood , this hangman unhanged must go .</p>
   <p>Now here Robin scowled , and his brawny fellows scowled likewise , and began to mutter and murmur against Jocelyn , who , leaning back to tree , strummed his lute and sang :</p>

     <l n="1">“ O , Life is sweet , but Life is fleet ,</l>

    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>“ Now out upon thee , brother ! ” cried Robin , forgetting to scowl . “ Out on thee with thy honied phrases , thy quipsome lilting rhymes ! Here go I to do a thing I ha ’ no lust to do — and all by reason o ’ thee ! Off — off wi ’ the halter , lads — loose the hangman-claws of him ! Hereafter , since he can pay no ransom , he shall be our serf ; to have a hangman fetch and carry shall be rare , methinks ! ”</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Quoth JOCELYN : How much should hangman 's flesh be worth i ’ the greenwood ,</l>
     <l n="2">Robin ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">“ Why , brother , ‘ tis poor , sad and dismal knave ; five gold pieces shall buy</l>
     <l n="4">him , aye — halter and all , and ‘ tis fair , good halter , look you ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="5">“ Why , then , ” said Jocelyn , opening his wallet , “ behold the monies , so do I</l>
     <l n="6">buy him of thee — ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>“ Now , by Saint Nick ! ” cried Robin , amazed . “ Nay , brother , an thou'lt buy so sorry a thing , give thy money to the merry lads ; I 'll none o n't . And now , ” said he , the money duly paid , “ what wilt do wi ’ thy hangman ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Sir Fool , ” cried Ranulph , falling on his knees at Jocelyn 's feet , “ fain would I serve thee — e'en to the peril o ’ the life thou hast saved . Bid me labour for thee and in labour shall be my joy , bid me fight for thee and I will fight whiles life is in me ; bid me follow thee and I will follow even unto — ”</p>
   <p>“ Nay , hangman , ” said Jocelyn , “ I bid thee rise and sing for us , and so be gone wheresoever thou wilt . ”</p>
   <p>Then Ranulph arose and glancing round upon the fierce company , from the noose at his feet to Jocelyn 's scarred face , he drew a great breath ; quoth he :</p>
   <p>“ Sir Fool , since ‘ tis thy will fain would I give thee song blithe and joyful since joy is in my heart , but alack , though my songs begin in merry vein they do grow mournful anon ; howbeit , for thy joy now will I sing my cheeriest ; ” whereupon Ranulph brake into song thus :</p>

    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>“ Aye , verily , ” sighed Ranulph , “ ‘ tis my curse . I begin with laugh and end in groan . I did mean this for merry song , yet it turned of itself sad song despite poor I , and there 's the pity o n't — ”</p>
   <p>“ Enough ! ” growled Robin , “ away with him . Brand , do you hoodwink him in his ‘ kerchief and give him safe conduct to beyond the ford , and so set Master Hangman Grimglum-grief on his road — ”</p>
   <p>“ Sir Fool , ” cried Ranulph , “ God den t'ye and gramercy . Should it be e'er thy fate to die o ’ the gallows , may I have thy despatching — I will contrive it so sweetly shalt know nought of it — oho ! ‘ twould be my joy . ”</p>
   <p>“ Off ! ” cried Robin . “ Off , thou pestiferous fungus lest I tread on thee — hence , away ! ”</p>
   <p>So the outlaws blindfolded Ranulph and led him off at speed .</p>
   <p>“ Away , ” quoth Jocelyn , nodding , “ so now in faith must I , Robin — ”</p>
   <p>“ What , is't indeed farewell , brother ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Aye , Robin . ”</p>
   <p>“ Why , then , what may I give thee in way o ’ love and friendship ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Thy hand . ”</p>
   <p>“ Behold it , brother ! And what beside ? Here is purse o ’ good pieces — ha ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Nay , Robin , prithee keep them for those whose need is greater . ”</p>
   <p>“ Can I nought bestow — dost lack for nothing , brother ? ”</p>
   <p>“ What thou , methinks , may not supply — ”</p>
   <p>“ And that ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Horse and armour ! ” Now at this , Robin laughed and clapped hand to thigh ; quoth he :</p>
   <p>“ Come with Robin , brother ! ” So he brought Jocelyn into a cave beneath the steep and , lighting a torch from fire that burned there , led him on through other caves and winding passages rough-hewn in the rock , and so at last to a vasty cavern .</p>
   <p>And here was great store of merchandise of every sort ,— velvets , silks , and rich carpets from the Orient ; vases of gold and silver , and coffers strong-clamped with many iron bands . And here also , hanging against the rocky walls , were many and divers suits of armour with helms and shields set up in gallant array ; beholding all of which Jocelyn paused to eye merry Robin askance ; quoth he soberly :</p>
   <p>“ Sir Rogue , how came ye by all this goodly furniture ? ”</p>
   <p>“ By purest chance , brolher , ” laughed Robin , “ for hark ‘ ee —</p>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">“ Aye , ” said Jocelyn , “ but what of all those knights and squires whose</l>

    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>“ Here or there , brother , they come and they go . Ha , yonder soundeth Ralfwyn 's horn — three blasts which do signify some right fair windfall . Come , let us see what this jolly wind hath blown us this time ! ” So saying , Robin laughed and led the way out into the sunny green . And here , surrounded by a ring of merry forest rogues , they beheld a knight right gallantly mounted and equipped , his armour blazing in the sun , his gaudy bannerole a-flutter from long lance , his shield gaudy and brave with new paint ; beholding which , Robin chuckled gleefully ; quoth he :</p>
   <p>“ Oho ! On a field vert three falcons gules , proper , charged with heart ensanguined — aha , here 's good booty , methinks ! ”</p>
   <p>Now , as this splendid knight rode nearer , contemptuous of his brawny captors , Robin stared to see that on his helmet he wore a wreath of flowers , while lance and sword , mace and battle-axe were wreathed in blooming roses .</p>
   <p>“ Ho , Jenkyn , Cuthbert ! ” cried Robin , “ what Sir Daintiness have ye here ? ” But ere his grinning captors could make reply , the knight himself spake thus :</p>

   <p>SIR PALAMON : Even she .</p>
   <p>JOCELYN : But here she is not and thou art , how then may one that is , woo one is not ?</p>

     <l n="3">Discourse , Sir Dove !</l>
   </lg>
   <p>SIR PALAMON : In two words then , thou lewd lurcher o ’ the thickets ; I ride thus in steely panoply — the which doth irk me sore — by reason of the tongue of my mother ( good soul ! ) the which doth irk me more . For she ( worthy lady ! ) full-fed o ’ fatuous fantasies and fables fond , fuddled i ’ faith o ’ faddling fictions as — gestes of jongleurs , tales told by tramping troubadours , ballades of babbling braggarts , romances of roysterous rhymers , she ( good gossip ! ) as I say , having hearkened to and perused the works of such-like pelting , paltry prosers and poets wherein sweep of sword and lunge o ’ lance is accompted of worthier repute than the penning of dainty distich and pretty poesies pleasingly passionate . She , I say — my mother ( God rest her ! ) , e'en she with tongue most harsh , most bitter and most unwearying , hath enforced me , her son ( whom Venus bless ! ) — e'en I that am soul most transcendental — I that am a very wing-ed Mercury — me , I say she hath , by torrential tongueful tumult ( gentle lady ! ) , constrained to don the habit of a base , brawling , beefy and most material Mars ! Wherefore at my mother 's behest ( gracious dame ! ) I ride nothing joyful to be bruised and battered by any base , brutal braggart that hath the mind to try a tilt with me . Moreover —</p>
   <p>ROBIN : Hold ! Take breath , gentle sir , for thine own sweet sake draw thy wind .</p>
   <p>SIR PALAMON : ‘ Tis done , fellow , ‘ tis done ! And now in three words will I —</p>
   <p>ROBIN : Cry ye mercy , sir , thy two words do yet halloo “ Buzz-buzz ” in mine ears .</p>
   <p>SIR PALAMON : Faith , robber-rogue , since I a tongue possess —</p>
   <p>ROBIN : Therein thou art very son o ’ thy mother ( whom St. Anthony cherish ! ) .</p>
   <p>SIR PALAMON : With this rare difference , outlaw — for whereas her tongue ( honoured relict ! ) is tipped with gall , wormwood , henbane , hemlock , bitter-aloes and verjuice , and stingeth like the adder , the asp , the toad , the newt , the wasp , and snaky-haired head of Medusa , mine —</p>

   <p>SIR PALAMON : Mine , thou paltry knave , I say mine —</p>
   <p>ROBIN : Buzz — ha — buzz !</p>
   <p>JOCELYN : I pray you , Sir Knight , doth the Red Gui tilt at to-morrow 's joust ?</p>
   <p>SIR PALAMON : Base mime , he doth ! My Lord Gui of Ells , Lord Seneschal of Raddemore , is myfriend , a very mirror of knightly prowess , the sure might of whose lance none may abide . He is , in very truth , the doughtiest champion in all this fair country , matchless at any and every weapon , a - horse or a-foot , in sooth a very Ajax , Achilles , Hector , Roland and Oliver together and at once , one and indivisible , aye — by Cupid a very paladin !</p>
   <p>“ ‘ Tis so I 've heard , ” said Jocelyn thoughtfully .</p>
   <p>SIR PALAMON : Two knights only there are might cope with him , and one Sir Agramore and one Jocelyn of the Helm , Duke of Brocelaunde . The fame of which last rumour hath so puffed up that thrice my Lord Gui hath sent his cartel of defiance , but the said Duke , intent on paltry battles beyond his marches , hath thrice refused , and wisely — so ‘ tis said .</p>
   <p>“ Aye me , messire , ” quoth Jocelyn , strumming his lute , “ and so bloweth the wind . Yet mayhap these twain shall meet one day . ”</p>
   <p>ROBIN : And heaven send me there to see ! Now as to thee , Sir Softly Sweet , fair Lord of Tong , thy goodly horse and armour are mine henceforth , first because thy need of them is nothing , secondly because thou art my prisoner —</p>
   <p>SIR PALAMON : And thirdly , Sir Riotous Roughness , I do freely on thee bestow them , hide and hair , bolt and rivet .</p>
   <p>ROBIN : Now as to thy ransom , Sir Mildly-Meek , at what price dost rate thy value , spiritual and corporeal ?</p>
   <p>SIR PALAMON : Fellow , though youthful , well-favoured and poet esteemed , I am yet marvellous modest ! ‘ Tis true I am knight of lineage lofty , of patrimony proud , of manors many —</p>
   <p>ROBIN : Even as of thy words , Sir Emptiness .</p>
   <p>SIR PALAMON : ‘ Tis also true , thou ignorant atomy , I , like Demosthenes , am blessed with a wonder o ’ words and glory o ’ sweet phrase , and yet , and here 's the enduring wonder — I am still but man , though man blessed with so much profundity , fecundity , and redundity of thought and expression , and therefore a facile scribe or speaker , able to create , relate , formulate or postulate any truth , axiomatic , sophistry subtle , or , in other words , I can narrate —</p>
   <p>ROBIN : Verily Sir Windbag thou dost , to narrate , thyself with wind inflate , and , being thus thyself inflate of air , thou dost thyself deflate of airy sounds which be words o ’ wind , and windy words is emptiness — thus by thy inflatings and deflatings cometh nought but wind bred o ’ wind , and nought is nothing , so nought is thy relation or narration ; whereof make now a cessation , so will I , in due form , formulate , postulate and deliberate . Thus , with my good rogues ’ approbation and acclamation , I will of thy just valuation make tabulation , and give demonstration in relation to thy liberation from this thy situation , as namely , viz . and to-wit : First thou art a poet ; in this is thy marketable value to us nought , for poets do go empty of aught but thought of sort when wrought , unbought ; thus go they short which doth import they 're empty , purse and belly . Second , upon thy testimony thou'rt a man . Go to ! Here we be out again , for on the score of manliness thou art not . Yet thou art flesh and blood — good ! for here we deal in such . Not that we yearn for thy flesh and blood , but , being thine , they are to thee dear , perchance , and thou would'st fain keep them alive a little longer ; wherefore thou shalt for thy loved flesh and blood pay — purchasing the same of us . And , as flesh varies , so do our prices vary ; we do sell a man his own flesh and blood at certain rateable values . Thus unto a hangman we did of late sell a hangman , in fair good halter , and he a hangman brawny , for no more than five gold pieces , the which was cheap , methinks , considering the goodly halter , and he a lusty , manly rogue to boot . Now as for thee , thou'rt soft and of a manlihood indifferent , so would I rate thee at one gold piece .</p>
   <p>SIR PALAMON : Ignorant grub ! Am I less than base hangman — I , a knight —</p>
   <p>ROBIN : True , Sir Knight , thou'rt a knight for no reason but that thou art knight born and thus , by nought but being born , hath won to thyself nobility , riches and honours such as no man may win either by courage , skill , or learning , since highborn fool and noble rogue do rank high ‘ bove such . So thou art knight , Sir Knight , and for thy knighthood , thy lineage lofty , thy manors many , mulcted thou shalt be in noble fashion . For thy manhood I assess thee at one gold piece , but , since thou'rt son o ’ thy dam ( whom the Saints pity ! ) we do fine thee five thousand gold pieces — thy body ours until the purchase made . Away with him , lads ; cherish him kindly , unarm him gently , and set him a-grinding corn till his ransom be paid — away !</p>
   <p>Now here was mighty roar of laughter and acclaim from all who heard , only Sir Palamon scowled , and , for once mute and tongue-tied , was led incontinent away to his labours .</p>
   <p>“ And now , brother , ” quoth Robin , turning where Jocelyn stood smiling and merry-eyed , “ what o ’ this armour dost seek , and wherefore ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Art a lovely robber , Robin , ” said he ; “ a very various rogue , yet no rogue born , methinks ! ”</p>
   <p>“ I was not always outlaw , brother — howbeit , what would a Fool with horse and knightly arms ? ”</p>
   <p>Now Jocelyn , bending close , whispered somewhatin Robin 's ear , whereon he clapped hand to thigh , and laughed and laughed until the air rang again .</p>
   <p>“ Oho , a jape — a jape indeed ! ” he roared . “ O lovely brother , to see proud knight unhorsed by prancing motley Fool ! Hey , how my heart doth jump for gladness ! An thou wilt a-tilting ride , I will squire thee — a Fool of a knight tended by Rogue of a squire . O , rare — aha ! oho ! Come thy ways , sweet brother , and let us set about this joyous jape forthwith ! ”</p>
   <p>And thus it was that , as evening fell , there rode , through bowery bracken and grassy glade , two horsemen full blithe and merry , and the setting sun flashed back in glory from their glittering armour .</p>

     <l n="1">How Red Gui sore smitten was in fight</l>
     <l n="2">By motley Fool in borrowed armour dight .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">Now shrill tucket and clarion , trumpet and horn</l>
     <l n="4">With their cheery summons saluted the morn ,</l>
     <l n="5">Where the sun , in his splendour but newly put on ,</l>
     <l n="6">Still more splendid made pennon and brave gonfalon</l>
     <l n="7">That with banners and pennoncelles fluttered and flew</l>
     <l n="8">High o'er tent and pavilion of every hue .</l>
     <l n="9">For the lists were placed here , for the tournament set ,</l>
     <l n="10">Where already a bustling concourse was met ;</l>
     <l n="11">Here were poor folk and rich folk , lord , lady and squire ,</l>
     <l n="12">Clad in leather , in cloth and in silken attire ;</l>
     <l n="13">Here folk pushed and folk jostled , as people still do</l>
     <l n="14">When the sitters be many , the seats scant and few ;</l>
     <l n="15">Here was babble of voices and merry uproar ,</l>
     <l n="16">For while some folk laughed loud , some lost tempers and swore .</l>
     <l n="17">Until on a sudden this tumult and riot</l>
     <l n="18">Was hushed to a murmur that sank into quiet</l>
     <l n="19">As forth into the lists , stern of air , grave of face ,</l>
     <l n="20">Five fine heralds , with tabard and trumpet , did pace</l>
     <l n="21">With their Lion-at-arms , or Chief Herald , before ;</l>
     <l n="22">And a look most portentous this Chief Herald wore ,</l>
     <l n="23">And , though portly his shape and a little too round ,</l>
     <l n="24">Sure a haughtier Chief Herald could nowhere be found .</l>
     <l n="25">So aloof was his look and so grave his demeanour ,</l>
     <l n="26">Humble folk grew abashed , and mean folk felt the meaner ;</l>
     <l n="27">When once more the loud clarions had all echoes woke</l>
     <l n="28">This Chief Herald in voice deep and sonorous spoke :</l>

     <l n="92">That your herald is rather a bore .</l>
     <l n="93">He talks such a lot ,</l>
     <l n="94">And it seems frightful rot —</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="14">

     <l n="98">As by heralds was said in those days ;</l>
     <l n="99">Though their trumpets they blew ,</l>
     <l n="100">It is none the less true</l>
     <l n="101">That they blew them in other folks ’ praise .</l>
     <l n="102">If my herald verbose is</l>

     <l n="104">Of high-sounding rodomontade ,</l>

     <l n="107">So blame not — O , blame not the bard .</l>
     <l n="108">But while we are prating</l>
     <l n="109">Our herald stands waiting</l>

    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Thus spake the Chief Herald and so paced solemnly down the lists while the long clarions filled the air with gallant music . But the lovely Benedicta , throned beneath silken canopy , knit her black brows and clenched slender hands and stamped dainty foot , yet laughed thereafter , whereupon Yolande , leaning to kiss her flushed cheek , questioned her , wondering :</p>
   <p>“ How say'st thou to this , my loved Benedicta ? ”</p>
   <p>Quoth the DUCHESS :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ I say , my sweeting , ‘ tis quite plain</l>
     <l n="2">That I must run away again !</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Howbeit I care not one rush for their laws ! Marry forsooth — a fig ! Let them make laws an they will , these reverend , right troublesome grey-beards of mine , they shall never wed me but to such a man as Love shall choose me , and loving him — him only will I wed , be he great or lowly , rich or poor , worthy or unworthy , so I do love him , as is the sweet and wondrous way of love . ”</p>
   <p>“ Ah , Benedicta ! what is love ? ”</p>
   <p>“ A joy that cometh but of itself , all unsought ! This wisdom had I of a Fool i ’ the forest . Go learn you of this same Fool and sigh not , dear wench . ”</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Nay , but , ” sighed Yolande , lovely cheeks a-flush , “ what of Sir</l>
     <l n="2">Agramore — hath he not sworn to wed thee ? ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>“ I do fear Sir Agramore no longer , Yolande , since I have found me one may cope with him perchance — even as did a Fool with my Lord Gui of Ells upon a tune . Art sighing again , sweet maid ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Nay , indeed — and wherefore should I sigh ? ”</p>
   <p>“ At mention of a Fool , belike . ”</p>
   <p>“ Ah , no , no , ‘ twere shame in me , Benedicta ! A Fool forsooth ! ”</p>
   <p>“ Yet Fool of all fools singular , Yolande . And for all his motley a very man , methinks , and of a proud , high bearing . ”</p>
   <p>Here Yolande 's soft cheek grew rosy again :</p>
   <p>“ Yet is he but motley Fool — and his face — marred hatefully — ”</p>
   <p>“ Hast seen him smile , Yolande , for then — how , dost sigh again , my sweet ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Nay , indeed ; but talk we of other matters — thy so sudden flight — tell me all that chanced thee , dearest Benedicta . ”</p>
   <p>“ Why first — in thine ear , Yolande — my jewel is not — see ! ”</p>
   <p>“ How — how , alas ! O most sweet lady — hast lost it ? Thy royal amulet ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Bestowed it , Yolande . ”</p>
   <p>“ Benedicta ! On whom ? ”</p>
   <p>“ A poor soldier . One that saved me i ’ the forest from many of Sir Agramore 's verderers — a man very tall and strong and brave , but dight in ragged cloak and rusty mail — ”</p>
   <p>“ Ragged ? A thief — ”</p>
   <p>“ Mayhap ! ”</p>
   <p>“ An outlaw — ”</p>
   <p>“ Mayhap ! ”</p>
   <p>“ A wolf'shYpppHeNhead — a wild man and fierce . ”</p>
   <p>“ True he is very wild and very fierce , but very , very gentle — ”</p>
   <p>“ And didst give to such thy jewel ? O Benedicta ! The Heart-in-heart ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Freely — gladly ! He begged it of me very humbly and all unknowing what it signified — ”</p>
   <p>“ O my loved Benedicta , alas ! ”</p>
   <p>“ O my sweet Yolande , joy ! ”</p>
   <p>“ But if he should claim thee , and he so poor and wild and ragged — ”</p>
   <p>“ If he should , Yolande , if he should —</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">‘ He that taketh Heart-in-heart ,</l>
     <l n="2">Taketh all and every part . ’</l>
   </lg>
   <p>O , if he should , Yolande , then I — must fulfil the prophecy . Nay , dear my friend , stare not so great and sadly-eyed , he knoweth not the virtue of the jewel nor have I seen him these many days . ”</p>
   <p>“ And must thou sigh therefore , Benedicta ? ”</p>
   <p>But now the trumpets blew a fanfare , and forth rode divers gallant knights , who , spurring rearing steeds , charged amain to gore , to smite and batter each other with right good will while the concourse shouted , caps waved and scarves and ribands fluttered .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">But here , methinks , it booteth not to tell</l>
     <l n="2">Of every fierce encounter that befell ;</l>
     <l n="3">How knight ‘ gainst knight drove fierce with pointless spear</l>
     <l n="4">And met with shock that echoed far and near ;</l>
     <l n="5">Or how , though they with blunted swords did smite ,</l>
     <l n="6">Sore battered was full many a luckless wight .</l>
     <l n="7">But as the day advanced and sun rose high</l>
     <l n="8">Full often rose the shout : “ A Gui — A Gui ! ”</l>
     <l n="9">For many a proud ( though bruised and breathless ) lord ,</l>
     <l n="10">Red Gui 's tough lance smote reeling on the sward ;</l>
     <l n="11">And ever as these plaudits shook the air ,</l>
     <l n="12">Through vizored casque at Yolande he would stare .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>And beholding all the beauty of her he smiled evilly and muttered to himself , glancing from her to certain lusty men-at-arms who , lolling ‘ gainst the barriers , bore at back and breast his badge of the bloody hand .</p>
   <p>But the fair Yolande heeded him none at all , sitting with eyes a-dream and sighing ever and anon ; insomuch that the Duchess , watching her slyly , sighed amain also and presently spake :</p>
   <p>“ Indeed , and O verily , Yolande , meseemeth we do sigh and for ever sigh , thou and I , like two poor , love-sick maids . How think'st thou ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Nay , O Benedicta , hearken ! See , who rideth yonder ? ”</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Now even as thus fair Yolanda spoke ,</l>
     <l n="2">A horn 's shrill note on all men 's hearing broke ,</l>
     <l n="3">And all eyes turned where rode a gallant knight ,</l>
     <l n="4">In burnished armour sumptuously bedight .</l>
     <l n="5">His scarlet plumes ‘ bove gleaming helm a-dance ,</l>
     <l n="6">His bannerole a-flutter from long lance ,</l>
     <l n="7">His gaudy shield with new-popped blazon glowed :</l>
     <l n="8">Three stooping falcons that on field vert showed ;</l>
     <l n="9">But close-shut vizor hid from all his face</l>
     <l n="10">As thus he rode at easy , ambling pace .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="11">“ Now as I live ! ” cried Benedicta . “ By his device yon should be that foolish</l>
     <l n="12">knight Sir Palamon of Tong ! ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>“ Aye , truly ! ” sighed Yolande . “ Though he wear no motley hither rideth indeed a very fool . And look , Benedicta — look ! O , sure never rode knight in like array — see how the very populace groweth dumb in its amaze ! ”</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">For now the crowd in wonderment grew mute ,</l>
     <l n="2">To see this knight before him bare a lute ,</l>
     <l n="3">While blooming roses his great helmet crowned ,</l>
     <l n="4">They wreathed his sword , his mighty lance around .</l>
     <l n="5">Thus decked rode he in rosy pageantry ,</l>
     <l n="6">And up the lists he ambled leisurely ;</l>
     <l n="7">Till , all at once , from the astonied crowd</l>
     <l n="8">There brake a hum that swelled to laughter loud ;</l>
     <l n="9">But on he rode , nor seemed to reck or heed ,</l>
     <l n="10">Till ‘ neath the balcony he checked his steed .</l>
     <l n="11">Then , handing lance unto his tall esquire ,</l>
     <l n="12">He sudden struck sweet chord upon his lyre ,</l>
     <l n="13">And thus , serene , his lute he plucked until</l>
     <l n="14">The laughter died and all stood hushed and still ;</l>
     <l n="15">Then , hollow in his helm , a clear voice rang ,</l>
     <l n="16">As , through his lowered vizor , thus he sang :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="17">“ A gentle knight behold in me ,</l>
     <l n="18">( Unless my blazon lie ! )</l>
     <l n="19">For on my shield behold and see ,</l>
     <l n="20">Upon field vert , gules falcons three ,</l>
     <l n="21">Surcharged with heart ensanguiney ,</l>
     <l n="22">To prove to one and all of ye ,</l>
     <l n="23">A love-lorn knight am I . ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>But now cometh ( and almost in haste ) the haughty and right dignified Chief Herald with pursuivants attendant , which latter having trumpeted amain , the Herald challenged thus :</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ Messire , by the device upon thy shield ,</l>

     <l n="4">Why thus ye ride with foolish roses crowned ? ”</l>
    </lg>

   <p>“ Sweet Saints aid us ! ” The Chief Herald clasped his massy brow and gazed with eye distraught . “ Sir Knight — messire — my very good and noble Lord of Tong — I grope !

I excogitate ... yet grope I still ... impart , part ... thy part and its part ... so many parts ... and roses ... and songs o ’ love ... a lute ! O , thundering Mars , I ... Sound , trumpets ! ”</p>
   <p>But the Duchess up-starting , silenced Herald and trumpeters with imperious hand .</p>
   <p>“ Sir Knight of Tong , ” said she , “ ‘ tis told thou'rt of nimble tongue and a maker of songs , so we bid thee sing if thy song be of Love — for Love is a thing little known and seldom understood these days . Here be very many noble knights wondrous learned in the smiting of buffets , but little else ; here be noble dames very apt at the play of eyes , the twining of fingers , the languishment of sighs , that , seeking True-love , find but its shadow ; and here also grey beards that have forgot the very name of Love . So we bid thee sing us of Love — True-love , what it is . Our ears attend thee ! ”</p>
   <p>“ Gracious lady , ” answered the Knight , “ gladly do I obey . But Love is mighty and I lowly , and may speak of Love but from mine own humility . And though much might be said of Love since Love 's empire is the universe and Love immortal , yet will I strive to portray this mighty thing that is True-love in few , poor words . ”</p>
   <p>Then , plucking sweet melody from his lute , the Knight sang as here followeth :</p>

   <p>“ O , wonderful ! ” cried the Duchess . “ My Lord of Tong hath found him manhood and therewith a wisdom beyond most and singeth such love as methought only angels knew and maids might vision in their dreams . Ah , Yolande — that such a love could be ... e'en though he went ragged and poor in all but love .... ”</p>
   <p>“ Benedicta , ” sighed Yolande , hands clasped on swelling bosom , “ O Benedicta , here is no foolish Lord of Tong ... and yet ... O , I am mad ! ”</p>
   <p>“ Why , then , ‘ tis sweet madness ! So , my Yolande , let us be mad awhile together ... thou — a Fool ... and I — a beggar-rogue ! ”</p>

     <l n="29">“ Nay , my Benedicta , these be only dreams , but life is real and dreams a</l>
     <l n="30">very emptiness ! ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>“ And is ‘ t so , forsooth ? ” exclaimed the Duchess . “ Then am I nought but a duchess and lonely , thou a maid fearful of her own heart , and yon singer of love only a very futile knight , Sir Palamon of Tong , nothing esteemed by thee for wit or valour and little by his peers — see how his challengers do throng . How think you ? ” But the lady Yolande sat very still and silent , only she stared , great-eyed , where danced the scarlet plume .</p>
   <p>And indeed many and divers were the knights who , beholding the blazon of Tong , sent the bearer their defiance , eager to cope with him ; and each and every challenge Sir Palamon accepted by mouth of his tall esquire who ( vizor closed , even as his lord 's ) spake the Chief Herald in loud , merry voice , thus :</p>
   <p>“ Sir Herald , whereas and forinasmuch as this , my Lord of Tong himself , himself declaring fool , is so himself-like as to meet in combat each and every of his challengers — themselves ten , my lord that is fool , himself himself so declaring , now declareth by me that am no fool but only humble esquire — messire , I say , doth his esquire require that I , the said esquire , should on his part impart as followeth , namely and to wit : That these ten gentle knights , the said challengers , shall forthwith of themselves choose of themselves , themselves among themselves thereto agreeing , which of themselves , among themselves of themselves so chosen , shall first in combat adventure himself against my Lord of Tong himself . And moreover , should Fortune my lord bless with victory , the nine remaining shall among themselves choose , themselves agreeing , which of themselves shall next , thus chosen of themselves , themselves represent in single combat with this very noble , fool-like Lord of Tong , my master . Furthermore , whereas and notwithstanding — ”</p>
   <p>“ Hold , sir ! ” cried the Chief Herald , fingering harassed brow . “ Pray thee ‘ bate — O , abate thy speechful fervour . Here forsooth and of truth is notable saying — O , most infallibly — and yet perchance something discursive and mayhap a little involved . ”</p>
   <p>“ Nay , Sir Herald , ” quoth the esquire , “ if involved ‘ twill be resolved if revolved , thus : Here be ten lords would fight one , and one — that is my lord who is but one — ten fight one by one . But that ten , fighting one , may as one fight , let it be agreed that of these ten one be chosen one to fight , so shall one fight one and every one be satisfied — every one of these ten fighting one , one by one . Thus shall ten be one , and one ten fight one by one till one be discomfited . Shall we accord the matter simply , thus ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Sir , ” quoth the Chief Herald , gasping a little , “ Amen ! ”</p>
   <p>“ O ! ” cried the Duchess , clapping her hands , “ O Yolande , hark to this rare esquire ! Surely , I have heard yon cunning tongue ere this ? ”</p>
   <p>But Yolande gazed ever where Sir Palamon , having taken his station , set himself in array . For now , the ten knights having chosen one to represent them , forth rode their champion resplendent in shining mail and green surcoat with heralds before to proclaim his name and rank .</p>
   <p>“ Yolande , ” quoth the Duchess softly , “ pray — pray this Lord of Tong may tilt as bravely as he doth sing , for Sir Thomas of Thornydyke is a notable jouster . ”</p>
   <p>The trumpets blew a fanfare and , levelling their pointless lances , both knights gave spur , their great horses reared , broke into a gallop and thundered towards each other .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">But hard midway upon the green surcoat ,</l>
     <l n="2">Sir Palamon 's stout lance so truly smote ,</l>
     <l n="3">That , ‘ neath the shock , the bold Sir Thomas reeled</l>
     <l n="4">And , losing stirrups , saddle , lance and shield ,</l>
     <l n="5">Down , down upon the ling outstretched he fell</l>
     <l n="6">And , losing all , lost breath and speech as well .</l>
     <l n="7">Thus , silent all , the bold Sir Thomas lay ,</l>
     <l n="8">Though much , and many things , he yearned to say ,</l>
     <l n="9">Which things his squires and pages might surmise</l>
     <l n="10">From the expression of his fish-like eyes</l>
     <l n="11">E'en as they bore him from that doleful place ;</l>
     <l n="12">While , near and far , from all the populace ,</l>
     <l n="13">Rose shout on shout that echoed loud and long :</l>
     <l n="14">“ Sir Palamon ! Sir Palamon of Tong ! ”</l>
     <l n="15">So came these ten good knights , but , one by one ,</l>
     <l n="16">They fell before this bold Sir Palamon ,</l>
     <l n="17">Whose lance unerring smote now helm , now shield ,</l>
     <l n="18">That many an one lay rolling on the field .</l>
     <l n="19">But each and all themselves did vanquished yield ;</l>
     <l n="20">And loud and louder did the plaudits grow ,</l>
     <l n="21">That one knight should so many overthrow .</l>
     <l n="22">Even Sir Gui , within his silken tent</l>
     <l n="23">Scowled black in ever-growing wonderment .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>But the Knight of Tong , his gaudy shield a little battered , his fine surcoat frayed and torn , leaped from his wearied steed and forthwith mounted one held by his tall esquire , a mighty charger that tossed proud head and champed his bit , pawing impatient hoof .</p>
   <p>“ Aha ! ” quoth the esquire , pointing to ten fair steeds held by ten fair pages . “ Oho , good brother , most puissant Knight of Tong , here is good and rich booty — let us begone ! ”</p>
   <p>“ Nay , ” answered the Knight , tossing aside his blunt tilting-spear , “ here is an end to sportful dalliance — reach me my lance ! ”</p>
   <p>“ Ha , is't now the Red Gui 's turn , brother ? The Saints aid thee , in especial two , that , being women , are yet no saints yet awhile — see how they watch thee , sweet , gentle dames ! Their prayers go with thee , methinks , brother , and mine also , for the Red Gui is forsooth a valiant rogue ! ”</p>
   <p>And now , mounted on the great black war-horse , the Knight of Tong rode up the lists :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">His scarlet plume ‘ bove shining helm a-dance ,</l>
     <l n="2">His bannerole a-flutter from long lance ,</l>
     <l n="3">Till he was come where , plain for all to spy ,</l>
     <l n="4">Was hung the shield and blazon of Sir Gui ,</l>
     <l n="5">With bends and bars in all their painted glory ,</l>
     <l n="6">Surcharged with hand ensanguined — gules or gory .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Full upon this bloody hand smote the sharp point of Sir Palamon 's lance ; whereupon the watching crowd surged and swayed and hummed expectant , since here was to be no play with blunted weapons but a deadly encounter .</p>
   <p>Up started Sir Gui and strode forth of his tent , grim-smiling and confident . Quoth he :</p>
   <p>“ Ha , my Lord of Tong , thou'rt grown presumptuous and over-venturesome , methinks . But since life thou dost hold so cheap prepare ye for death forthright ! ”</p>
   <p>So spake the Lord of Ells and , beckoning to his esquires , did on his great tilting-helm and rode into the lists , whereon was mighty roar of welcome , for , though much hated , he was esteemed mighty at arms , and the accepted champion of the Duchy . So while the people thundered their acclaim the two knights galloped to their stations and , reining about , faced each other from either end of the lists ,</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">And halted thus , their deadly spears they couched ,</l>
     <l n="2">With helms stooped low , behind their shields they crouched ;</l>
     <l n="3">Now rang the clarions ; goading spurs struck deep ,</l>
     <l n="4">The mighty chargers reared with furious leap</l>
     <l n="5">And , like two whirlwinds , met in full career ,</l>
     <l n="6">To backward reel ‘ neath shock of splintering spear :</l>
     <l n="7">But , all unshaken , every eye might see</l>
     <l n="8">The bloody hand , the scarred gules falcons three .</l>
     <l n="9">Thrice thus they met , but at the fourth essay ,</l>
     <l n="10">Rose sudden shout of wonder and dismay ,</l>
     <l n="11">For , smitten sore through riven shield , Sir Gui</l>
     <l n="12">Thudded to earth there motionless to lie .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Thus Sir Gui , Lord of Ells and Seneschal of Raddemore , wounded and utterly discomfited , was borne raging to his pavilion while the air rang with the blare of trumpet and clarion in honour of the victor . Thereafter , since no other knight thought it prudent to challenge him , Sir Palamon of Tong was declared champion of the tournament , and was summoned by the Chief Herald to receive the victor 's crown . But even as he rode towards the silk-curtained balcony , a distant trumpet shrilled defiance , and into the lists galloped a solitary knight .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Well-armed was he in proud and war-like trim ,</l>
     <l n="2">Of stature tall and wondrous long of limb ;</l>
     <l n="3">‘ Neath red surcoat black was the mail he wore ;</l>
     <l n="4">His glitt'ring shield a rampant leopard bore ,</l>
     <l n="5">Beholding which the crowd cried in acclaim ,</l>
     <l n="6">“ Ho for Sir Agramore of Biename ! ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>But from rosy-red to pale , from pale to rosy-red flushed the Duchess Benedicta , and clenching white teeth , she frowned upon Sir Agramore 's fierce and warlike figure . Quoth she :</p>
   <p>“ Oh , sure there is no man so vile or so unworthy in all Christendom as this vile Lord of Biename ! ”</p>
   <p>“ Unless , ” said Yolande , frowning also , “ unless it be my Lord Gui of Ells ! ”</p>
   <p>“ True , my Yolanda ! Now , as thou dost hate Sir Gui so hate I Sir Agramore , therefore pray we sweet maid , petition we the good Saints our valiant singer shall serve my hated Sir Agramore as he did thy hated Sir Gui — may he be bruised , may he be battered , may — ”</p>
   <p>“ Oho , ‘ tis done , my sweeting ! A-hee — a-hi , ‘ tis done ! ” croaked a voice , and starting about , the Duchess beheld a bent and hag-like creature ,</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">With long , sharp nose that showed beneath her hood ,</l>
     <l n="2">A nose that curved as every witch 's should ,</l>
     <l n="3">And glittering eye , before whose baleful light ,</l>
     <l n="4">The fair Yolande shrank back in sudden fright .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>“ Nay , my Yolande , ” cried the Duchess , “ hast forgot old Mopsa , my foster - mother , that , being a wise-woman , fools decry as witch , and my ten grave and learned guardians have banished therefor ? Hast forgot my loved and faithful Mopsa that is truly the dearest , gentlest , wisest witch that e'er witched rogue or fool ? But O Mopsa , wise mother — would'st thou might plague and bewitch in very truth yon base caitiff knight , Sir Agramore of Biename ! ”</p>

   <p>“ Go to , Mopsa , thou'rt mad ! ” quoth the Duchess . “ For yonder is this hated lord very strong and hale , and in well-being whiles thou dost rave ! Truly thou'rt run mad , methinks ! ”</p>
   <p>But the old Witch only mumbled and mowed , and cracked her finger-bones as is the custom of witches .</p>
   <p>Meantime , Sir Agramore , checking his fiery charger and brandishing heavy lance fiercely aloft , roared loud defiance :</p>
   <p>“ What ho ! Ye knights , lords , esquires , and lovers of lusty blows , hither come I with intent , sincere and hearty , to bicker with , fight , combat and withstand all that will — each and every , a-horse or a-foot , with sword , battleaxe or lance . Now all ye that love good blows — have at ye ! ”</p>
   <p>Here ensued great clamour and a mighty blowing of trumpets that waxed yet louder when it was proclaimed that Sir Palamon , as champion of the day , had accepted Sir Agramore 's haughty challenge .</p>
   <p>And now all was hushed as these two doughty knights faced each other and , as the trumpets brayed , charged furiously to meet with thunderous shock of breaking lances and reeling horses that , rearing backwards , fell crashing upon the torn and trampled grass . But their riders , leaping clear of lashing hooves , drew their swords and , wasting no breath in words , beset each other forthwith , smiting with right good will .</p>
   <p>Sir Agramore 's leopard shield was riven in twain by a single stroke , Sir Palamon 's scarlet plume was shorn away , but they fought only the fiercer as , all untiring , the long blades whirled and flashed until their armour rang , sparks flew , and the populace rocked and swayed and roared for very joy . Once Sir Agramore was beaten to his knees , but rising , grasped his sword in two hands and smote a mighty swashing blow , a direful stroke that burst the lacing of Sir Palamon 's great helm and sent it rolling on the sward . But , beholding thus his adversary 's face , Sir Agramore , crying in sudden amaze , sprang back ; for men all might see a visage framed in long , black-curled hair , grey-eyed , but a face so direly scarred that none , having seen it but once , might well forget .</p>
   <p>“ Par Dex ! ” panted Sir Agramore , lifting his vizor .</p>
   <p>“ Pertinax ! ” gasped Duke Jocelyn . “ O Pertinax — thou loved and lovely smiter — ne'er have I been so sore battered ere now ! ”</p>
   <p>Hereupon all folk stared in hugeous wonderment to behold these two champions drop their swords and leap to clasp and hug each other in mighty arms , to pat each other 's mailed shoulders and grasp each other 's mailed hands . Quoth Sir Pertinax :</p>
   <p>“ Lord , how came ye in this guise ? ”</p>
   <p>“ My Pertinax , whence stole ye that goodly armour ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Lord , oath made I to requite one Sir Agramore of Biename for certain felon blow . Him sought I latterly therefore , and this day met him journeying hither , and so , after some disputation , I left him lying by the way , nor shall he need armour awhile , methinks — wherefore I took it and rode hither seeking what might befall — ”</p>
   <p>But here , Sir Gui , all heedless of his wound , started up from his couch , raising great outcry :</p>
   <p>“ Ha — roguery , roguery ! Ho , there , seize me yon knave that beareth the cognizance of Tong . Ha — treason , treason ! ” At this , others took up the cry and divers among the throng , beholding Duke Jocelyn 's scarred features , made loud tumults : “ The Fool ! The Fool ! ‘ Tis the Singing Motley ! ‘ Tis the rogue-Fool that broke prison — seize him ! Seize him ! ” And many , together with the soldiery , came running .</p>
   <p>“ Lord , ” quoth Sir Pertinax , catching up his sword , “ here now is like to be a notable , sweet affray ! ” But even as these twain turned to meet their many assailants was thunder of hoofs , a loud , merry voice reached them , and they saw Robin hard by who held two trampling chargers .</p>
   <p>“ Mount , brothers — mount ! ” he cried . “ Mount , then spur we for the barriers ! ” So they sprang to saddle and , spurring the rearing horses , galloped for the barriers , all three , nor was there any who dare stay them or abide the sweep of those long swords . Thus , leaping the barriers , they galloped away and left behind roaring tumult and dire confusion .</p>
   <p>And amid all this , hid by the silken curtains of her balcony , the Duchess Benedicta uttered a joyous cry and , clasping Yolande in her arms , kissed her rapturously .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Yolande ! ” she cried , “ O dear my friend , thou didst see — even as did I — a</l>

     <l n="7">Mopsa , thou wise witch-mother ? ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>“ Ah , sweet children ! ” croaked the Witch , touching each with claw-like hand yet hand wondrous gentle . “ True-love shall indeed find ye , hide where ye will . For True-love , though blind , they say , hath eyes to see all that is good and sweet and true . A poor man-at-arms in rusty mail may yet be true man and a fool , for all his motley , wise .

     <l n="1">How Pertinax fell out with Robin and with Friar , Yet , in that very hour ,</l>
     <l n="2">came by his heart 's desire .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The sinking sun had set the West aflame , When our three riders to the wild-wood came , Where a small wind ‘ mid sun-kissed branches played , And deep'ning shadows a soft twilight made ; Where , save for leafy stirrings , all was still , Lulled by the murmur of a bubbling rill That flowed o'ershadowed by a mighty oak , Its massy bole deep-cleft by lightning stroke . Here Robin checked his steed . “ Good friends , ” quoth he ,</p>
   <p>My daughter Gillian suggesteth :</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Gill : That 's rather good ,</l>

   <p>Then said Robin , quoth he : “ Good friends , here are we safe ! ” And , checking his steed within this pleasant shade , he dismounted .</p>
   <p>“ Safe , quotha ? ” said Sir Pertinax , scowling back over shoulder . “ Not so ! Surely we are close pursued — hark ! Yonder be horsemen riding at speed — ha , we are beset ! ”</p>
   <p>“ Content you , sir ! ” answered Robin . “ Think you I would leave behind good booty ? Yonder come ten noble coursers laden with ten goodly armours the same won a-jousting to-day by this right wondrous Fool , my good gossip — ”</p>
   <p>“ Thy gossip , forsooth ! ” snorted Sir Pertinax . “ But tell me , presumptuous fellow , how shall these ten steeds come a-galloping hither ! ”</p>
   <p>“ Marry , on this wise , Sir Simple Innocence — these steeds do gallop for sufficient reason , namely — they are to gallop bidden being ridden , bestridden and chidden by whip and spur applied by certain trusty men o ’ my company , which men go habited , decked , dressed , clad , guised and disguised as smug , sleek citizens , Sir Innocent Simplicity — ”</p>
   <p>“ Par Dex ! ” exclaimed Sir Pertinax , scowling . “ And who ‘ rt thou , sirrah , with men at thy beck and call ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Behold ! ” said Robin , unhelming . “ Behold the king of all masterless rogues , and thy fellow gallow'shYpppHeNbird , Sir High Mightiness ! ”</p>
   <p>“ Ha , is ‘ t thou ? ” cried Sir Pertinax . “ Now a plague on thy kingdom and thee for an unhanged , thieving rogue — ”</p>
   <p>“ E'en as thyself , ” nodded Robin , “ thou that flaunted thy unlovely carcass in stolen armour . ”</p>
   <p>“ Ha ! ” roared Sir Pertinax , clapping hand on sword . “ A pest — a murrain ! This to me , thou dog'shYpppHeNmeat ? Malediction ! Now will I crack thy numbskull for a pestilent malapert — ”</p>
   <p>“ Nay , Sir Grim-and-gory , ” laughed Robin , “ rather will I now use thee as thou would'st ha ’ served me on a day but for this generous and kindly Fool , my good comrade ! ” And speaking , Robin sprang nimbly to the great oak tree and thrusting long arm within the jagged fissure that gaped therein drew forth a hunting-horn and winded it loud and shrill . And presently was a stir , a rustle amid the surrounding brushwood and all about them were outlaws , wild men and fierce of aspect , and each and every grasped long-bow with arrow on string and every arrow was aimed at scowling Sir Pertinax .</p>
   <p>“ Per Dex ! ” quoth he , “ and is this death , then ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Verily ! ” nodded Robin , “ an I do speak the word . ”</p>
   <p>“ So be it — speak ! ” growled Sir Pertinax . “ Come , Death — I fear thee not ! ” And out flashed his long sword ; but even then it was twisted from his grasp and Lobkyn Lollo , tossing the great blade aloft and , catching it very neatly , laughed and spake :</p>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">“ Nay , hold a while , sweet lads ! ” laughed Robin , “ the surly rogue shall sing</l>
     <l n="6">for his life and our good pleasaunce . ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>“ Sing ? ” roared Sir Pertinax . “ I sing ! I ? Ha , dare ye bid me so , base dog ? Sing , forsooth ? By Og and Gog ! By the Seven Champions and all the fiends , rather will I die ! ” And here , being defenceless , Sir Pertinax clenched mighty fists and swore until he lacked for breath .</p>
   <p>Then spake Jocelyn , gentle-voiced .</p>
   <p>“ Sing , Pertinax , ” quoth he .</p>
   <p>“ Ha — never ! Not for all the — ”</p>
   <p>“ I do command thee , Pertinax . As Robin once sang for his life , now must thou sing for thine . Song for song , ‘ t is but just ! Sing , Pertinax ! ”</p>
   <p>“ Nay , ” groaned the proud knight , “ I had rather drink water and chew grass like a rabbit . Moreover I ha ’ no gift o ’ song — ”</p>
   <p>“ Do thy best ! ” quoth Robin .</p>
   <p>“ I 'm harsh o ’ voice — knave ! ”</p>
   <p>“ Then croak — rogue ! ” quoth Robin .</p>
   <p>“ No song have I — vermin ! ”</p>
   <p>“ Make one — carrion ! But sing thou shalt though thy song be no better than hog-song which is grunt . Howbeit sing thou must ! ”</p>
   <p>Hereupon Sir Pertinax gnashed his teeth and glaring balefully on Robin lifted hoarse voice and burst forth into fierce song :</p>

   <p>“ Ha — not so ! ” quoth Sir Pertinax . “ For troth I do sing better than methought possible , and my rhyming is none so ill ! So will I rhyme thy every knavish part and sing song till song and rhyme be ended . Have at thee again , base fellow !</p>

   <p>But Sir Pertinax , astride his charger that cropped joyously at sweet , cool grass , sat chin on fist , lost in the throes of composition , nothing heeding , even when came the ten steeds with the ten suits of armour .</p>
   <p>Now these ten horses bare eleven riders , tall , lusty fellows all , save one shrouded in hood and cloak and whom Jocelyn viewed with quick , keen eyes . And thus he presently whispered Robin who , laughing slyly , made signal to his followers , whereupon , by ones and twos they stole silently away until there none remained save only Sir Pertinax who , wrestling with his muse , stared aloft under knitted brows , all unknowing , and presently brake out singing on this wise :</p>

   </lg>
   <p>“ Except it be a woman ! ” sang a soft , sweet voice hard by , in pretty mockery . Hereat Sir Pertinax started so violently that his mail clashed and he stared about him eager-eyed but , finding himself quite alone , sighed and fell to reverie .</p>
   <p>“ A woman ? ” said he aloud . “ ‘ Except it be a woman — ’ ”</p>
   <p>THE VOICE : Aye — a woman , O craven soldier !</p>
   <p>SIR PERTINAX : Why here is strange echo methinks and speaketh — with her voice !</p>

   <p>“ Ha , think ye so in verity , sweet voice ! ” cried Sir Pertinax , and springing lightly to earth , strode forward on eager feet . And lo ! from behind a certain tree stepped one who , letting fall shrouding cloak and hood , stood there a maid , dark-haired and darkly bright of eye , very shapely and fair to see in her simple tire . And beholding her thus , the tender curve of scarlet lips , the flutter of slender hands , the languorous bewitchment of her eyes , Sir Pertinax halted .</p>

    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>“ Why , I do think thou'lt make a wooer some day mayhap , by study diligent . ‘ T will take long time and yet — I would not have thee learn too soon ! And hast thought of me ? A little ? ”</p>
   <p>“ I have borne thee ever within my heart . ”</p>
   <p>“ And wherefore wilt love maid so lowly ? ”</p>
   <p>“ For that thou art thyself and thyself — Melissa . And O , I love thy voice ! ”</p>
   <p>“ My voice ? And what more ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Thine eyes . Thy little , pretty feet . Thy scarlet mouth . Thy gentle , small hands . Thy hair . All of thee ! ”</p>
   <p>“ O , ” she murmured a little breathlessly , “ if thou dost so love me — woo me — a little ! ”</p>
   <p>“ Alas ! ” he sighed , “ I know not how . ”</p>
   <p>“ Hast ne'er wooed maid ere this , big soldier ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Never ! ”</p>
   <p>“ Thou poor Pertinax ! How empty — how drear thy life . For this do I pity thee with pity kin to love — ”</p>
   <p>“ Love ? ” he whispered . “ Ah , Melissa , couldst e'en learn to love one so unlovely , so rude , so rough and unmannered as I ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Never ! ” she sighed , “ O , never — unless thou teach me ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Would indeed I might , Melissa . Ah , teach me how I may teach thee to love one so unworthy as Pertinax ! ”</p>
   <p>Now hearkening to his harsh voice grown soft and tremulous , beholding the truth in his honest eyes , Melissa smiled , wondrous tender , and reaching out took hold upon his two hands .</p>
   <p>“ Kneel ! ” she commanded . “ Kneel here upon the grass as I do kneel . Now , lay by thy cumbrous helmet . Now fold thy great , strong hands . Now bow thy tall , grim head and say in sweet , soft accents low and reverent : ‘ Melissa , I do love thee heart and soul , thee only do I love and thee only will I love now and for ever . So aid me , Love , amen ! ’ ” Then , closing his eyes , Sir Pertinax bowed reverent head , and , humbly folding his hands , spake as she bade him . Thereafter opening his eyes , he saw her watching him through gathering tears , and leaning near , he reached out eager arms , yet touched her not . Quoth he : “ O maid beloved , what is thy sorrow ? ”</p>
   <p>“ ‘ Tis joy — joy , and thou — thou art so strong and fierce yet so gentle and simple of heart ! O , may I prove worthy thy love — ”</p>
   <p>“ Worthy ? Of my love ? ” he stammered . “ But O Melissa , I am but he thou didst name harsh of tongue . ”</p>
   <p>“ Aye , I did ! ” she sobbed .</p>
   <p>“ Hard of heart , flinty of soul , rude , unmannered and unlovely . ”</p>
   <p>“ Aye — I did and — loved thee the while ! ” she whispered . “ So now do I pray that I prove worthy . ”</p>
   <p>“ Worthy ? Thou ? O my sweet maid — thou that art kin to the holy angels , thou so high and far removed ‘ bove me that I do tremble and — fear to touch thee — ” .</p>
   <p>“ Nay , fear me not , Pertinax , ” she sighed , “ for though indeed I am all this , yet maid am I also and by times — very human . So Pertinax , thou great , fearless man-at-arms , lay by thy so great fears a while — I do beseech thee . ” Then Sir Pertinax , beholding the tender passion of her eyes , forgot his fear in glad wonderment and , reaching out hands that trembled for all their strength , drew her to his close embracement .</p>
   <p>And thus , kneeling together upon the sun-dappled sward , they forgot all things in this joyous world save only their love and the glory of it . And when they had kissed each other —</p>
   <p>My daughter GILLIAN remonstrateth :</p>
   <p>GILL : But , wait , they have n't yet , you know !</p>
   <p>MYSELF : Indeed , they have , I 've just said so .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">GILL : Then , father , please to tell me this :</l>
     <l n="2">How can a person say a kiss ?</l>
     <l n="3">And so , since kisses can n't be said ,</l>
     <l n="4">Please make them do it now instead .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">Thus , cradled in his strong arms , she questioned him tenderly :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="6">“ Dost mind how , upon a day , my Pertinax , didst ask of me the amulet I bore</l>
     <l n="7">within my bosom ? ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>“ Aye , ” he answered , “ and sure ‘ tis charm of potent magic whose spell brought us out of the dungeon at Canalise — the which is great matter for wonder ! But ‘ tis for thy dear sake I do cherish it — ”</p>
   <p>“ Bear you it yet ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Here upon my heart . ”</p>
   <p>“ And if I should ask it of thee again — wouldst render it back to me ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Never ! ” quoth he . “ Never , until with it I give thee myself also ! ”</p>
   <p>But presently she stirred in his embrace for upon the air was an approaching clamour , voices , laughter and the ring of mail .</p>
   <p>“ Come away ! ” whispered Melissa , upspringing to her feet . “ Come , let thou and Love and I hide until these disturbers be gone and the sweet world hold but us three again . ”</p>
   <p>Now , as they stood , hand in hand , deep hidden ‘ mid the green , they beheld six merry woodland rogues who led an ambling ass whereon rode a friar portly and perspiring albeit he had a jovial eye . And as he rode he spake his captors thus in voice full-toned and deep :</p>
   <p>“ Have a care , gentle rogues and brethren , hurry not this ambulant animal unduly , poor , much-enduring beast . Behold the pensive pendulation of these auriculars so forlornly a-dangle ! Here is ass that doth out-patience all asses , both four and two-legged . Here is meek ass of leisured soul loving not haste — a very pensive perambulator . So hurry not the ass , my brothers , for these several and distinct reasons or arguments . Firstly , dearly beloved , because I love haste no more than the ass ; secondly , brethren , ‘ t is property of Holy Church which is above all argument ; and , thirdly , ‘ t is bestridden by one Friar John , my very self , and I am forsooth weighty argument . Fourthly , beloved , ‘ tis an ass that — ha ! O sweet vision for eyes human or divine ! Do I see thee in very truth , thou damsel of disobedience , dear dame of discord , sweet , witching , wilful lady — is it thou in very truth , most loved daughter , or wraith conjured of thy magic and my perfervid imaginations — speak ! ”</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ ‘ T is I myself , Reverend Father ! ” laughed Melissa . “ O my dear , good Friar</l>
     <l n="2">John , methinks the kind Saints have brought thee to my need . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>“ Saints , quotha ! ” exclaimed the Friar , rolling merry eye towards his several captors . “ Call ye these — Saints ? Long have I sought thee , thou naughty maid , and to-day in my quest these brawny ‘ saints ’ beset me with bow and quarterstaff and me constrained hither — but my blessing on them since they have brought me to thee . And now , sweet child and daughter , whiles the news yet runneth hot-foot or , like bird unseen , wingeth from lip to lip , I thy ghostly father have rare good news for thee — ”</p>
   <p>“ Nay , Friar John , I will guess thy tidings : Sir Agramore of Biename lieth sorry and sore of a cudgelling . ”</p>
   <p>“ How ! ” cried the Friar . “ Thou dost know — so soon ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Verily , Reverend Father , nor have I or my worthy guardians aught to fear of him hereafter . And now have I right wondrous news for thee , news that none may guess . List , dear Friar John , thou the wisest and best loved of all my guardians ten ; to-day ye are absolved henceforth all care of your wilful ward since to-day she passeth from the guardianship of ye ten to the keeping of one . Come forth , Pertinax , thou only one beloved of me for no reason but that thou art thou and I am I — as is ever the sweet , mad way of True-love — come forth , my dear-loved , poor soldier ! ” Out from the trees strode Pertinax but , beholding his face , Friar John scowled and , viewing his rich surcoat and goodly armour , fell to perspiring wonder and amaze .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ Now by the sweet Saint Amphibalus ! ” quoth he . “ Surely these be the arms of</l>
     <l n="2">Sir Agramore , dread Lord of Biename ? ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">“ Most true , dear Friar John , ” answered Melissa , “ and by this same token Sir</l>
     <l n="4">Agramore lieth sore bruised e'en now . ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>“ Aha ! ” quoth the Friar , mopping moist brow . “ ‘ T is well — ‘ t is very well , so shall these two ears of mine , with eighteen others of lesser account , scathless go and all by reason of this good , tall fellow . Howbeit , I do know this same fellow for fellow of none account , and no fit mate for thee , noble daughter , love or no . A fierce , brawling , tatterdemalion this , that erstwhile tramped in company with long-legged ribald — a froward jesting fellow . Wherefore this fellow , though fellow serviceable , no fellow is for thee and for these sufficing reasons . Firstly — ”</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ Ha — enough ! ” quoth Sir Pertinax , chin out-thrust . “ ‘ Fellow ’ me no more ,</l>
     <l n="2">Friar — ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">“ Firstly , ” continued Friar John , “ because this out-at-elbows fellow is a</l>
     <l n="4">rogue . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="5">“ ‘ Rogue , ’ in thy teeth , Churchman ! ” growled Sir Pertinax .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>“ Secondly , ” continued Friar John , nothing abashed , “ because this rogue-fellow is a runagate roysterer , a nameless knave , a highway-haunter , a filching flick-o ’ - the-gibbet and a — ”</p>
   <p>“ Friar , ” snorted Sir Pertinax , “ thou ‘ rt but a very fat man scant o ’ breath , moreover thou ‘ rt a friar , so needs must I leave thee alive to make pestilent the air yet a little until thou chokest of an epithet . Meantime perform now one gracious act in thy so graceless life and wed me with this forest maiden . ”</p>
   <p>“ Forest maiden , forsooth ! ” cried Friar John . “ O Saints ! O Martyrs ! Forest maid , quotha ! And wed her — and unto thee , presumptuous malapert ! Ho , begone , thy base blood and nameless rank forbid — ”</p>
   <p>“ Hold there , shaveling ! ” quoth Sir Pertinax , scowling . “ Now mark me this ! Though I , being very man , do know myself all unworthy maid so sweet and peerless , yet , and she stoop to wed me , then will I make her lady proud and dame of divers goodly manors and castles , of village and hamlet , pit and gallows , sac and soc , with powers the high , the middle and the low and with ten-score lances in her train . For though in humble guise I went , no nameless rogue am I , but Knight of Shene , Lord of Westover , Framling , Bracton and Deepdene — ”</p>
   <p>“ How ! ” cried Melissa , pouting rosy lip and frowning a little . “ O Pertinax , art indeed a great lord ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Why , sooth — forsooth and indeed , ” he stammered , “ I do fear I am . ”</p>
   <p>“ Then thou ‘ rt no poor , distressful , ragged , outlaw-soldier ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Alack — no ! ” he groaned , regardful of her frown .</p>
   <p>“ Then basely hast thou tricked me — O cruel ! ”</p>
   <p>“ Nay , Melissa — hear me ! ” he cried , and , forgetful of friar and gaping outlaws , he clasped her fast ‘ prisoned ‘ gainst his heart . “ Thee do I love , dear maid , ‘ bove rank , or fame , or riches , or aught this world may offer . So , an thou wouldst have me ragged and destitute and outlaw , all this will I be for thy sweet sake since life were nought without thee , O maid I do so love — how say'st thou ? ”</p>
   <p>“ I say to thee , Pertinax , that thy so great love hath loosed thy tongue at last , Love hath touched thy lips with eloquence beyond all artifice since now , methinks , it is thy very soul doth speak me . And who shall resist such wooing ? Surely not I that do — love thee beyond telling . So take me , my lord , thy right hand in mine , the talisman in thy left — so ! Now , my Pertinax , speak thy heart 's wish . ”</p>
   <p>“ Friar , ” quoth Sir Pertinax , holding aloft the Crystal Heart , “ as her love is mine and mine hers , wed and unite us in our love — by the magic of this jewel I do command thee ! ”</p>
   <p>Here , beholding the talisman , Friar John gasped and stared round-eyed and incredulous .</p>
   <p>“ By Holy Rood ! ” he whispered , “ ‘ t is indeed the Crystal Heart ! ”</p>
   <p>“ And O ! ” sighed Melissa , “ O Friar John , thou dost mind the saying :</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ ‘ He that taketh Crystal Heart ,</l>
     <l n="2">Taketh all and every part ! ’ ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">“ Aye , truly — truly ! ” nodded the Friar .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="4">“ ‘ And by night , or eke by day ,</l>
     <l n="5">The Crystal Heart all must obey ! ’ ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="6">So saying he got him down from the ass and , for all his corpulence , louted</l>
     <l n="7">full low .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>“ Sir Knight of Shene , ” quoth he , “ by reason of this jewel potential thou dost bear , now must I perforce obey thy behest and wed thee unto this our gracious lady Benedicta , Duchess of Ambremont , Canalise , Tissingors , Fordyngstoke and divers other towns , villages and — ”</p>
   <p>“ Duchess — a duchess ? ” exclaimed Sir Pertinax . “ Duchess say'st thou — this , the Duchess Benedicta ! O Melissa — thou — thou — a duchess ! ”</p>
   <p>“ Sooth and forsooth , ” sighed she in pretty mockery , “ I do fear I am ! ”</p>
   <p>“ Then thou ‘ rt no humble maid , distressful and forlorn , Melissa ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Yea , Pertinax — all this am I indeed unless thou love me , and loving me , wed me , and wedding me love me the better therefor , and loving me ever the better , thou may'st learn a little some day how a woman may love a man . ”</p>
   <p>“ Par Dex ! ” mumbled Sir Pertinax , kissing her rosy finger-tips , “ be thou duchess or witch-maid o ’ the wood , I do love thee heart and soul , body and mind , now and for ever , Melissa . ”</p>
   <p>Then Friar John , beholding the radiant joy of their faces , reached forth his hands in blessing .</p>
   <p>“ Kneel ye , my children ! ” he sighed . “ For here methinks is true-love such as brighteneth this world all too seldom . So here , within the forest , the which is surely God 's cathedral , this your love shall be sanctified unto you and the world be the better therefor ! Kneel ye , my children ! ”</p>
   <p>And thus , kneeling upon the flower-sprent turf hand in hand and with heads reverently bowed , they were wed , while the six outlaws stared in silent awe and the meek ass cropped the grass busily .</p>
   <p>“ O Pertinax , ” sighed the Duchess as they rose , “ so greatly happy am I that I will others shall be happy likewise ; let us make this indeed a day of gladness . I pray thee sound the bugle that hangeth within the great oak , yonder . ”</p>
   <p>So Sir Pertinax took the horn and sounded thereon a mighty blast , loud and long and joyous . And presently came the outlaws , thronging in from all directions , until the sunny glade was full of their wild company , while in the green beyond pike-head twinkled and sword-blades glittered ; and foremost was Robin with Lobkyn Lollo beside him .</p>
   <p>“ Robin , ” said the Duchess , beckoning him near with white , imperious finger , “ Robin a ’ Green , thou whose tongue is quick and ready as thy hand , hast ever been gentle to the weak and helpless as I do know , in especial to two women that sought thy protection of late . ”</p>
   <p>“ Why , verily , lady , I mind them well , ” nodded Robin , “ and one was a maid passing fair and one an ancient dame exceeding wise . To aid such is ever a man 's joy — or should be . ”</p>
   <p>“ Knew ye who and what this maid was , Robin ? ”</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ Aye , lady , I knew her then as now for that proud and noble lady the</l>
     <l n="2">Duchess Benedicta . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">“ And yet , Robin , knowing this and having me in thy power didst suffer me to</l>
     <l n="4">go without let or hindrance or single penny of ransom ? ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>“ My lady Duchess , ” answered Robin , glancing round upon his wild company , “ we be outlaws , ‘ t is true , and rogues — mayhap , yet are we men and thou a lady passing fair , wherefore — though I knew thee for the Duchess Benedicta , thou wert safe with us since we war not with women and harm no maids be they of high or low degree ! ”</p>
   <p>“ Spoke like a very knight ! ” exclaimed the Duchess . “ How think'st thou , my lord ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Par Dex ! ” quoth Sir Pertinax . “ Aye , by Our Lady of Shene Chapel within the Wood I swear it — thou ‘ rt a man , Robin ! So now do I sue pardon of thee for my song o ’ rogues since no rogue art thou . And thou didst aid and shield her — this my wife that is the very eyes of me ! So , by my troth , my good friend art thou henceforth , Rob o ’ the Green ! ”</p>
   <p>“ Nay , my lord , ” answered Robin slyly , “ for I am but Robin , and outlaw , and thou art the Duke ! ”</p>
   <p>“ Forsooth — and so I am ! ” exclaimed Sir Pertinax . “ Ha — yet am I still a man , and therefore — ”</p>
   <p>“ Wait , my lord ! ” said Benedicta . “ Robin , give me thy sword ! ” So she took the weapon and motioning Robin to his knees , set the blade across his shoulder . “ Robin a ’ Green , ” said she , “ since thou art knightly of word and deed , knight shalt thou be in very truth . Sir Robin a ’ Forest I make thee and warden over this our forest country . Rise up , Sir Robert . ” Then up sprang Robin , bright-eyed and flushed of cheek .</p>
   <p>“ Dear my lady , ” cried he , “ since knight hast made me , thy knight will I be henceforth in life or in death — ” But here his voice was lost in the joyous acclamations of his followers who shouted amain until the Duchess quelled them with lifted hand .</p>
   <p>“ Ye men of the wild-wood , ” said she , looking round upon them gentle-eyed , “ all ye that be homeless and desolate , lying without the law , this day joy hath found me , for this is my wedding-morn . And as I am happy I would see ye happy also . Therefore upon this glad day do we make proclamation , my Lord Duke and I — this day we lift from you each and every , the ban of outlawry — free men are ye to go and come as ye list — free men one and all and good citizens henceforth I pray ! ” Now here was silence awhile , then a hoarse murmur , swelling to a jubilant shout until the sunny woodland rang with the joy of it , near and far .</p>
   <p>“ And now , Sir Robert , ” laughed the Duchess , “ pray you where is this noble Fool , this gentle Motley , this most rare singer of songs and breaker of lances ? Bid him to us . ”</p>
   <p>“ Ha — the Fool ! ” exclaimed Sir Pertinax , starting .</p>
   <p>“ My lady , ” answered Robin , “ true , he was here , but when I sought him , a while since , there was Sir Palamon 's armour he had worn , but himself gone — ”</p>
   <p>“ Gone — gone say'st thou ? ” cried Sir Pertinax , glancing about . “ Then needs must I go seek him — ”</p>
   <p>“ And wherefore , my lord ? ” cried the Duchess .</p>
   <p>“ ‘ T is my — my duty , Melissa ! ” stammered Sir Pertinax . “ He is my — my friend and — sworn brother-in-arms ! ”</p>
   <p>“ And am I not thy wife , Pertinax ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Aye , most dearly loved , and I , thy husband — and yet — needs must I seek this Fool , Melissa . ”</p>
   <p>“ O Pertinax — wilt leave me ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Leave thee ? ” groaned Sir Pertinax . “ Aye — for a while ! Leave thee ? Aye — though it break my heart needs must I ! He , my — brother-in-arms . My duty calleth — ”</p>
   <p>“ And what of thy duty to me ? ”</p>
   <p>Now as Sir Pertinax wrung his hands in an agony of indecision , rose a whisper of sweet sound , the murmur of softly-plucked lute-strings , and into the glade , cock'shYpppHeNcomb aflaunt and ass 's ears a-dangle Duke Jocelyn strode and sang as he came a song he had made on a time , a familiar air :</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ Good Pertinax , why griev'st thou so ?</l>
     <l n="2">Free of all duty thou dost go ,</l>
     <l n="3">Save that which thou to Love dost owe ,</l>
     <l n="4">My noble Pertinax . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">“ And love from heaven hath stooped thus low To me ! ” quoth Pertinax .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="6">But here came Robin with certain of his men leading a snow-white palfrey</l>
     <l n="7">richly caparisoned .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="8">“ Right noble lady , ” said he , “ behold here a goodly , fair jennet to thy</l>
     <l n="9">gracious acceptance . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="10">“ And indeed — ‘ t is rare , pretty beast ! ” exclaimed Benedicta . “ But Robin ,</l>
     <l n="11">Robin , O Sir Robert , whence had you this ? ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="12">“ Lady , upon a time I was an outlaw and lived as outlaws may , taking such</l>
     <l n="13">things as Fate bestowed , and , lady :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="14">“ Fate is a wind</l>
     <l n="15">To outlaws kind :</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>But now since we be free-men all , I and my fellows , fain would we march hence in thy train to thy honour and our joyance . Wilt grant us this boon , lady ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Freely , for ‘ tis rare good thought , Robin ! Surely never rode duke and duchess so attended . How the townsfolk shall throng and stare to see our wild following , and my worthy guardians gape and pluck their beards for very amaze ! How think you , good Friar John ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Why , verily , daughter , I , that am chiefest of thy wardens ten , do think it wise measure ; as for thy other guardians let them pluck and gape until they choke .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ In especial Greg'ry Bax ,</l>
     <l n="2">Who both beard and wisdom lacks .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>I say ‘ tis wise , good measure , for these that were outlaws be sturdy fellows with many friends in town and village , so shall this thy day of union be for them re-union , and they joy with thee . ”</p>
   <p>Now being mounted the Duchess rode where stood Jocelyn , and looked down on him merry-eyed .</p>
   <p>“ Sir Fool , ” said she , “ who thou art I know not , but I have hunted in Brocelaunde ere now , and I have eyes . And as thou ‘ rt friend to my dear lord , friend art thou of mine , so do we give thee joyous welcome to our duchy . And , being thy friend , I pray thou may'st find that wonder of wonders the which hideth but to be found , and once found , shall make wise Fool wiser . ”</p>
   <p>“ Sweet friend and lady , ” answered Jocelyn , “ surely man so unlovely as I may not know this wonder for his very own until it first seek him . Is ‘ t not so ? Let now thy woman 's heart counsel me . ”</p>
   <p>“ How , Sir Wise Folly , have I not heard thee preach boldness in love ere now ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Aye — for others ! ” sighed Jocelyn . “ But for myself — I fear — behold this motley ! This scarred face ! ”</p>
   <p>“ Why as to thy motley it becometh thee well — ”</p>
   <p>“ Aye , but my face ? O , ‘ t is a hideous face ! ”</p>
   <p>“ O Fool ! ” sighed Benedicta , “ know'st thou not that True-love 's eyes possess a magic whereby all loved things become fair and beauteous . So take courage , noble Motley , and may thy desires be crowned — even as our own . ”</p>
   <p>“ Gramercy , thou sweet and gentle lady . Happiness companion thee alway and Love sing ever within thee . Now for ye twain is love 's springtime , a season of sweet promise , may each promise find fulfilment and so farewell . ”</p>
   <p>“ Why then , Sir Fool , an thou wilt tarry here in the good greenwood a while , may Love guide thee . Now here is my counsel : Follow where thy heart commandeth and — fear not ! And now , Sir Robert a ’ Forest , form thy company , and since this is a day of gladness let them sing as they march . ”</p>
   <p>“ In sooth , dear my lady , that will we ! ” cried Robin . “ There is song o ’ spring and gladness I made that hath oft been our solace , and moreover it beginneth and endeth with jolly chorus well beknown to all . Ho , pikes to van and rear ! Bows to the flanks — fall in ! Now trusty friends o ’ the greenwood , free-men all , henceforth — now march we back to hearth and home and love , so sing ye — sing ! ”</p>
   <p>Hereupon from the ragged , close-ordered ranks burst a shout that swelled to rolling chorus ; and these the words :</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">The Men : Sing high , sing low , sing merrily — hey !</l>

   <p>So they marched blithely away , a right joyous company , flashing back the sunset glory from bright headpiece and sword-blade , while Jocelyn stood watching wistful-eyed until they were lost amid the green , until all sounds of their going grew to a hush mingling with the whisper of leaves and murmurous gurgle of the brook ; and ever the shadows deepened about him , a purple solitude of misty trees and tangled thickets , depth on depth , fading to a glimmering mystery .</p>
   <p>Suddenly amid these glooming shadows a shadow moved , and forth into the darkling glade , mighty club on mighty shoulder , stepped Lobkyn Lollo the Dwarf , and his eyes were pensive and he sighed gustily .</p>

   <p>Hearkening to this singing Yolande shivered , yet not with cold , and casting a cloak about her loveliness came and leaned forth into the warm , still glamour of the night , and saw where stood Jocelyn tall and shapely in the moonlight , but with hateful cock'shYpppHeNcomb ahYpppHeNflaunt and ass 's ears grotesquely a-dangle ; wherefore she sighed and frowned upon him , saying nothing .</p>
   <p>“ Yolande ? ” he questioned . “ O my lady , and wilt frown upon my singing ? ”</p>
   <p>Answered she , leaning dimpled chin upon white fist and frowning yet :</p>
   <p>“ Nay , not — not thy — singing . ”</p>
   <p>“ Is ‘ t then this cap o ’ Folly — my ass 's ears , Yolande ? Then away with them ! So shalt jester become very man as thou art very maid ! ” Forthwith he thrust back his cock'shYpppHeNcomb and so stood gazing up at her wide-eyed .</p>
   <p>But she , beholding thus his scarred face , shivered again , shrinking a little , whereupon Jocelyn bowed his head , hiding his features in his long , black-curling hair .</p>
   <p>“ Alas , my lady ! ” he said , “ doth my ill face offend thee ? This would I put off also for thy sake an it might be , but since this I may not do , close thou thine eyes a while and hear me speak . For now do I tell thee , Yolande , that I — e'en I that am poor jester — am yet a man loving thee with man 's love . I that am one with face thus hatefully scarred do seek thee in thy beauty to my love — ”</p>
   <p>“ Presumptuous Fool , how darest thou speak me thus ? ” she whispered .</p>
   <p>“ For that great love dareth greatly , Yolande . ”</p>
   <p>“ And what of thy lord ? How of Duke Jocelyn , thy master ? ”</p>
   <p>“ He is but man , lady , even as I . Moreover for thee he existeth not since thou hast ne'er beheld him — to thy knowing . ”</p>
   <p>“ Nay , then — what of this ? ” she questioned , drawing the jewelled picture from her bosom .</p>
   <p>“ ‘ T is but what it is , lady , a poor thing of paint ! ”</p>
   <p>“ But sheweth face of noble beauty , Fool ! ”</p>
   <p>“ Aye , nobly painted , Yolande ! A thing of daubed colours , seeing naught of thy beauty , speaking thee no word of love , whiles here stand I , a sorry Fool of beauty none , yet therewithal a man to woo thee to my love — ”</p>
   <p>“ Thy love ? Ah , wilt so betray thy lord 's trust ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Blithely , Yolande ! For thee I would betray my very self . ”</p>
   <p>“ And thyself art Fool faithless to thy lord , a rhyming jester , a sorry thing for scorn or laughter — and yet — thy shameful habit shames thee not , and thy foolish songs hold naught of idle folly ! And thou — thou art the same I saw ‘ mid gloom of dungeon sing brave song in thy chains ! Thou art he that overthrew so many in the lists ! O Joconde , my world is upside down by reason of thee . ”</p>
   <p>“ And thou , Yolande , didst stoop to me within my dungeon ! And thou didst pray for me , Yolande , and now — now within this sweet night thou dost lean down to me through the glory of thy hair — to me in my very lowliness ! And so it is I love thee , Yolande , love thee as none shall ever love thee , for man am I with heart to worship thee , tongue to woo thee , eyes to behold thy beauties , and arms to clasp thee . So am I richer than yon painted duke that needs must woo thee with my lips . And could I but win thee to love — ah , Yolande , could I , despite these foolish trappings , this blemished face , see Love look on me from thine eyes , O — then — ”</p>
   <p>“ How — then — Joconde ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Then should Fool , by love exalted , change to man indeed and I — mount up to heaven — thus ! ” So saying , Jocelyn began to climb by gnarled ivy and carven buttress . And ever as he mounted she watched him through the silken curtain of her hair , wide of eye and with hands tight-clasped .</p>
   <p>“ Ah , Joconde ! ” she whispered , “ ‘ t is madness — madness ! Ah , Joconde ! ” But swift he came and swung himself upon the balcony beside her and reached out his arms in mute supplication , viewing her wistfully but with scarred face transfigured by smile ineffably tender , and when he spoke his voice was hushed and reverent .</p>
   <p>“ I am here , Yolande , because methought to read within thy look the wonder of all wonders . But , O my lady , because I am but what I am , fain would I hear thee speak it also . ”</p>
   <p>“ Joconde , ” said she in breathless voice , “ wouldst shame me —? ”</p>
   <p>“ Shame ? ” he cried . “ Shame ? Can there be aught of shame in true love ? Or is it that my ass 's ears do shame thee , my cock'shYpppHeNcomb and garments pied shame the worship of this foolish heart , and I , a Fool , worshipping thee , shame thee by such worship ? Then — on , cock'shYpppHeNcomb ! Ring out , silly bells ! Fool 's love doth end in folly ! Off love — on folly — a Fool can but love and die . ”</p>
   <p>“ Stay , Joconde ; ah , how may I tell thee —? Why dost thou start and fumble with thy dagger ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Heard you aught , lady ? ”</p>
   <p>“ I heard an owl hoot in the shadows yonder , no more . ”</p>
   <p>“ True , lady , but now shall this owl croak like a frog — hearken ! Aha — and now shall frog bark like dog — ”</p>
   <p>“ And what meaneth this ? ”</p>
   <p>“ That thou , proud lady , must this night choose betwixt knightly rogue and motley Fool — here be two evils with yet a difference — ”</p>
   <p>“ Here is strange , wild talk , Fool ! ”</p>
   <p>“ Here shall be wild doings anon , lady , methinks . Hush thee and listen ! ”</p>
   <p>A jangle of bridle-chains , a sound of voices loud and rough , and a tread of heavy feet that , breaking rudely upon the gentle-brooding night , drove the colour from Yolande 's soft cheek and hushed her voice to broken whisper :</p>
   <p>“ Heaven shield us , what now , Joconde ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Wolves , lady , wolves that come to raven — see yonder ! ” Even as he spake they espied armed men who , bold and assured by reason of the solitude , moved in the garden below ; and on back and breast of each was the sign of the Bloody Hand .</p>
   <p>“ My Lord Gui 's followers ! Alas , Joconde , these mean thee ill — here is death for thee ! ” Now as she spake , Jocelyn thrilled to the touch of her hand upon his arm , a hand that trembled and stole to clasp his . “ Alas , Joconde , they have tracked thee hither to slay thee — ”</p>
   <p>“ And were this so , wouldst fly with me , Yolande ? Wouldst trust thy beauties to a Fool 's keeping ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Nay , nay , this were madness , Joconde ; rather will I hide thee — aye , where none shall dare seek thee — come ! ”</p>
   <p>“ Yolande , ” he questioned , “ Yolande , wilt trust thyself to Love and me ? ” But seeing how she shrank away , his eager arms fell and he bowed his head . “ Nay , I am answered , ” quoth he , “ even while thine eyes look love , thy body abhorreth Fool 's embrace — I am answered . Nay , ‘ t is enough , trouble not for words — ha , methinks it is too late , the wolves be hard upon us — hark ye to their baying ! ”</p>
   <p>And now was sudden uproar , a raving clamour of fierce shouts , and a thundering of blows upon the great door below .</p>
   <p>“ Yolande — ha , Yolande , yield thee ! Open ! Open ! ”</p>
   <p>“ Ah — mercy of God ! Is it me they seek ? ” she whispered .</p>
   <p>“ Thee , Yolande ! To bear thee to their lord 's embraces — ”</p>
   <p>“ Rather will I die ! ” she cried , and snatched the dagger from his girdle .</p>
   <p>“ Not so ! ” quoth he , wresting the weapon from her grasp . “ Rather shalt thou live a while — for thou art mine — mine to-night , Yolande — come ! ” And he clasped her in fierce arms . “ Nay , strive not lest I kiss thee to submission , for thou art mine , though it be for one brief hour and death the next ! ” So , as she struggled for the dagger , he kissed her on mouth and eyes and hair until she lay all unresisting in his embrace ; while ever and anon above the thunder of blows the night clamoured with the fierce shout :</p>
   <p>“ Open — open ! Yolande , ha , Yolande ! ”</p>
   <p>“ There is death — and worse ! ” she panted . “ Loose me ! ”</p>
   <p>“ Stay , ” he laughed , “ here thou ‘ rt in thy rightful place at last — upon my heart , Yolande . Now whither shall I bear thee ? Where lieth safety ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Loose me ! ” she commanded .</p>
   <p>“ Never ! Hark , there yields the good door at last ! ”</p>
   <p>“ Then here will we die ! ”</p>
   <p>“ So be it , Yolande ! A sweet death thus , heart to heart and lip to lip ! ”</p>
   <p>“ O Fool — I hate thee ! ”</p>
   <p>“ Howbeit , Yolande — I love thee ! ”</p>
   <p>“ Yolande ! Ha — Yolande ! ”</p>
   <p>The cry was louder now and so near that she shivered and , hiding her face , spake below her breath :</p>
   <p>“ The turret-stair — behind the arras of my bed ! ”</p>
   <p>Swiftly , lightly he bore her down the winding stair and by divers passage-ways until , thrusting open a narrow door , he found himself within the garden and , keeping ever amid the darkest shadows , hasted on to the postern hard by the lily-pool .</p>
   <p>And now Yolande felt herself swung to lofty saddle , heard Jocelyn 's warning shout drowned in a roar of voices and loud-trampling hoofs as the great horse reared , heard a fierce laugh and , looking up , saw the face above her grim and keen-eyed beneath its foolish cock'shYpppHeNcomb as his vicious steel flashed to right and left , and ever as he smote he mocked and laughed :</p>
   <p>“ Ha — well smitten , Lob ! Oho , here Folly rides with pointed jest keen and two-edged — make way , knaves — make way for Folly — ”</p>
   <p>The snorting charger , wheeled by strong hand , broke free , whereon rose an uproar of shouts and cries that sank to a meaningless babble swept backward on the rush of wind . Away , away they sped , through moonlight and shadow , with fast-beating hoofs that rang on paved walk , that thudded on soft grass , that trampled the tender flowers ; and Yolande , swaying to the mighty arm that clasped her , saw the fierce , scarred face bent above her with eyes that gleamed under scowling brows and mouth grim-smiling ; and shivering , she looked no more .</p>
   <p>On they sped with loosened rein , o'er grassy mead , through ferny hollows , o'erleaping chattering rill that babbled to the moon , ‘ mid swaying reeds and whispering sedge , past crouching bush and stately tree , and so at last they reached the woods . By shadowy brake and thicket , through pools of radiant moonlight , through leafy , whispering glooms they held their way , across broad glade and clearing , on and on until all noise of pursuit was lost and nought was to hear save the sounds of their going .</p>
   <p>Thus rode they , and with never a word betwixt them , deep and deeper into the wild until the moon was down and darkness shut them in ; wherefore Jocelyn drew rein and sat a while to listen . He heard the good steed , deep-breathing , snuff at dewy grass ; a stir and rustle all about him ; the drowsy call of a bird afar ; the soft ripple of water hard by and , over all , the deep hush of the wild-wood . Then upon this hush stole a whisper :</p>
   <p>“ O , ‘ tis very dark ! ”</p>
   <p>He : Dark , Lady ? Why so ‘ tis , and yet ‘ tis natural , for ‘ tis night , wherefore ‘ tis the bright god Phoebus is otherwhere , and Dian , sly-sweet goddess , hath stole her light from heaven , wherefore ‘ tis ‘ tis dark , lady .</p>
   <p>She : Where are we ?</p>
   <p>He : The sweet Saints know that , lady — not I !</p>
   <p>She ( scornfully ): Verily , thou art no saint —</p>
   <p>He : Not yet , lady , not yet — witness these ass 's ears .</p>
   <p>She : True , thou ‘ rt very Fool !</p>
   <p>He : In very truth , lady , and thou art lost with this same Fool , so art thou in very woeful case . As for me , a lost fool is no matter , wherefore Fool for himself grieveth no whit . But for thee — alas ! Thou art a proud lady of high degree , very nice of thy dainty person , soft and delicate of body , so shall the greensward prove for thee uneasy couch , I judge , and thou sleep ill —</p>
   <p>She : Sleep ? No thought have I of sleep ! Ride on , therefore . Why tarry we here ?</p>
   <p>He : Lady , for three sufficing reasons — our foes pursue not , I 'm a-weary , and ‘ tis very dark —</p>
   <p>She : No matter ! Ride on , I do command thee .</p>
   <p>He : Aye , but whither ?</p>
   <p>She : I care not so thou leave this place ; ‘ tis an evil place !</p>
   <p>He : Why ,' tis good place , very well secluded and with stream hard by that bubbleth . So here will we bide till dawn . Suffer me to aid thee down .</p>
   <p>She : Touch me not ! Never think I fear thee though I am alone .</p>
   <p>He : Alone ? Nay , thou ‘ rt with me , that is — I am with thee and thou art with a Fool . So is Fool care-full Fool since Fool hath care of thee . Suffer me now to aid thee down since here will we wait the day . Come , my arm about thee so , thy hand in mine —</p>
   <p>She ( angrily ): O Fool most base — most vile —</p>
   <p>He : Nay , hush thee , hush ! and listen to yon blithesome , bubblesome , babbling brook how it sigheth ‘ mid the willows , whispereth under reedy bank and laugheth , rogue-like , in the shallows ! Listen how it wooeth thee :</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Though , lady , hard thy couch must be ,</l>
     <l n="2">If thou should'st wakeful lie ,</l>
     <l n="3">Here , from the dark , I 'll sing to thee</l>
     <l n="4">A drowsy lullaby .</l>
     <l n="5">O lady fair — forget thy pride</l>
     <l n="6">Whiles thou within the greenwood bide .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="7">And now suffer me to aid thee down .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="8">She : Why wilt thou stay me in this evil place ?</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>He ( patiently ): The wild is ill travelling in the dark , lady ; there be quagmires and perilous ways — wherefore here must we bide till dawn . Suffer me to —</p>
   <p>SHE ( breathlessly and shrinking from his touch ): But I fear not quagmires — there be greater perils — more shameful and — and — ‘ tis so dark , so dark ! ‘ Tis hateful place . Ride we till it be day —</p>
   <p>He ( mockingly ): Perils , lady ? Why certes there be perils — and perils . Perils that creep and crawl , perils that go on four legs and perils two - legged — e'en as I . But I , though two-legged , am but very fool of fools and nothing perilous in blazing day or blackest night . So stint thy fears , lady , for here bide we till dawn !</p>
   <p>Herewith he caught her in sudden arms and lifted her to the ground ; then , dismounting , he set about watering and cherishing the wearied steed and tethered him beside a dun stream that rippled beneath shadowy willows ; and so doing , fell a-singing on this wise :</p>

   </lg>
   <p>“ Say'st thou so , lady , forsooth ? ” sighed he , busied with his lute . “ Now were I other than Fool , here should I judge was hope of winning thy love . But being only Fool I , with aid of woe-begone lute , will sing thee merry song to cheer thee of thy perilous fears — ”</p>
   <p>“ Enough , ill Fool , I 'll hear thee not ! ”</p>
   <p>“ So be it , dear lady ! Then will we sit an list to the song of yon stream , for streams and rivers , like the everlasting hills , are passing wise with length of days — ”</p>
   <p>“ And thou'rt a very Fool ! ” she cried angrily . “ A fond Fool presumptuous in thy folly ! ”</p>
   <p>“ As how presumptuous , proud lady ? ” he questioned humbly .</p>
   <p>“ In that thou dreamest I — stoop to fear thee ! ”</p>
   <p>“ Aye , verily ! ” sighed he . “ Alas , thou poor , solitary , foolish , fearful maid , thou art sick with fear of me ! So take now my dagger ! Thus Fool offenceless shall lie defenceless at thy mercy and , so lying , sleep until joyous day shall banish thy so virginal fears ! ” Which saying , he tossed off belt and dagger and setting them beside her , rolled his weather-worn cloak about him , stretched himself beneath the dim willows and straightway fell a-snoring . And after some while she questioned him in voice low and troubled :</p>
   <p>“ O Joconde , art truly sleeping ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Fair lady , ” he answered , “ let these my so loud snores answer thee . ”</p>
   <p>Up sprang Yolande and , coming beside him in the gloom , cast back his girdle , speaking quick and passionate :</p>
   <p>“ Take back thy dagger lest I be tempted to smite it to the cruel , mocking heart of thee ! ” Then turned she stately back and left him , but , being hid from view , cast herself down full length upon the sward , her pride and stateliness forgotten quite . Now Jocelyn , propped on uneasy elbow , peered amid the gloom for sight of her and hearkened eagerly for sound of her ; but finding this vain , arose and , creeping stealthily , presently espied her where she lay , face hidden in the dewy grass . Thus stood he chin in hand disquieted and anxious-eyed and wist not what to do .</p>
   <p>“ Lady ? ” he questioned at last ; but she stirred not nor spoke . “ Yolande ! ” he murmured , drawing nearer ; but still she moved not , though his quick ear caught a sound faint though very pitiful . “ Ah , dost thou weep ? ” he cried . Yolande sobbed again , whereupon down fell he beside her on his knees , “ Dear lady , why grievest thou ? ”</p>
   <p>“ O Joconde , ” she sighed , “ I am indeed solitary — and fearful ! And thou — thou dost mock me ! ”</p>
   <p>“ Forgive me , ” he pleaded humbly , “ and , since thou'rt solitary , here am I . And , for thy fears , nought is here shall harm thee , here may'st thou sleep secure — ”</p>
   <p>“ Stay , Joconde , the forest is haunted of wolves and — worse , ‘ tis said ! ”</p>
   <p>“ Then will I watch beside thee till the day . And now will I go cut bracken for thy bed . ”</p>
   <p>“ Then will I aid thee . ” So she arose forthwith and , amid the fragrant gloom , they laboured together side by side ; and oft in the gloom her hand touched his , and oft upon his cheek and brow and lip was the silken touch of her wind-blown hair . Then beneath arching willows they made a bed , high-piled of springy bracken and sweet grasses , whereon she sank nestling , forthwith .</p>
   <p>“ O , ‘ tis sweet couch ! ” she sighed .</p>
   <p>“ Yet thou'lt be cold mayhap ere dawn , ” quoth he , “ suffer me to set my cloak about thee . ”</p>
   <p>“ But how of thyself , Joconde ? ”</p>
   <p>“ I am a Fool well seasoned of wind and rain , heat and cold , lady , and ‘ tis night of summer . ” So he covered her with his travel-stained cloak and , sitting beneath a tree , fell to his watch . And oft she stirred amid the fern , deep-sighing , and he , broad back against the tree , sighed oftener yet .</p>
   <p>“ Art there , Joconde ? ” she questioned softly .</p>
   <p>“ Here , lady . ”</p>
   <p>“ ‘ Tis very dark , ” sighed she , “ and yet , methinks , ‘ tis sweet to lie thus in the greenwood so hushed and still and the stars to watch like eyes of angels . ”</p>
   <p>“ Why , ‘ tis night of summer , lady , a night soft and languorous and fragrant of sleeping flowers . But how of grim winter , how of rain and wind and lashing tempest — how think you ? ”</p>
   <p>“ That summer would come again , Joconde . ”</p>
   <p>“ Truly here is brave thought , lady . ”</p>
   <p>“ Hark , how still is the night , Joconde , and yet full of soft stir , a sighing amid the leaves ! ‘ Tis like the trees whispering one another . O , ‘ tis sweet night ! ”</p>
   <p>“ Soon to pass away , alas ! ” he sighed , whereupon she , stirring upon her ferny couch , sighed also ; thereafter fell they silent awhile hearkening to the leafy stirrings all about them in the dark , and the slumberous murmur of the stream that , ever and anon , brake into faint gurglings like a voice that laughed , soft but roguish .</p>
   <p>SHE : I pray thee talk to me .</p>
   <p>HE : Whereof , lady ?</p>
   <p>SHE : Thyself .</p>
   <p>HE : I am a Fool —</p>
   <p>SHE : And why sit so mumchance ?</p>
   <p>HE : I think .</p>
   <p>SHE : Of what ?</p>
   <p>HE : Folly .</p>
   <p>SHE : And why dost sigh so deep and oft ?</p>
   <p>HE : I grieve for thee .</p>
   <p>SHE : For me ! And wherefore ?</p>
   <p>HE : Being lost with a Fool thou'rt desolate , sad and woeful .</p>
   <p>SHE : Am I , Joconde ? And how dost know all this ?</p>
   <p>HE : ‘ Tis so I do think , lady .</p>
   <p>SHE : Then are thy thoughts folly indeed . If thou must sigh , sigh for thyself .</p>
   <p>HE : Why so I do , lady , and therewith grieve for myself and thyself , myself being Fool and thyself a dame of high degree , thus , betwixt whiles , I do fear thee also .</p>
   <p>SHE : Thou fear ! Thou fear me forsooth ! And wherefore fear a helpless maid ?</p>
   <p>HE : There is the reason — she is helpless !</p>
   <p>SHE : Ah , there doth Fool speak like chivalrous knight .</p>
   <p>HE : Or very fool — a fool that fain would win fair Dian from high heaven . Alas , poor Fool , that , being fool , must needs look and sigh and sigh and look and leave her to the winning of some young Endymion !</p>
   <p>SHE ( dreamily ): Endymion was but lowly shepherd , yet was he loved !</p>
   <p>HE : Endymion was fair youth comely of feature , lady . Now had he worn ass 's ears ‘ bove visage scarred — how then ? On Ida 's mount he had been sighing forlorn and lonely yet , methinks . For maids ’ hearts are ever governed by their eyes —</p>
   <p>SHE : Art so wise in maids ’ hearts , Joconde ?</p>
   <p>HE : Wise am I in this : No man may ever know the heart of a woman — and woman herself but seldom .</p>
   <p>Now here was silence again wherein Yolande , smiling , viewed him a dim shape in the gloom , and he leaned back to watch a star that twinkled through the leafy canopy above .</p>
   <p>SHE : Thou art Duke Jocelyn 's Fool at court ?</p>
   <p>HE : I am Duke Jocelyn 's fool here and there and everywhere , lady .</p>
   <p>SHE : Yet have I heard Duke Jocelyn was a mighty man-at-arms and , though youthful , sober-minded , full of cares of state and kept no Fool at court .</p>
   <p>HE : Lady , his court is filled o ’ fools as is the way of other courts and amongst these many fools first cometh the Duke himself —</p>
   <p>SHE : How , and darest thou call this mighty Duke a fool ?</p>
   <p>HE : Often , lady !</p>
   <p>SHE : And what like is he ?</p>
   <p>HE : Very like a man , being endowed of arms , legs , eyes , ears — of each two , no more and no less , as is the vulgar custom .</p>
   <p>SHE : But is he not of beauty high and noble , of god-like perfection far beyond poor , common flesh and blood ? ‘ Tis so the painter has limned his face , ‘ tis so I dream him to my fancy .</p>
   <p>HE : Lady , I am but a Fool , let the picture answer thee .</p>
   <p>SHE : And he , this mighty Duke of god-like beauty doth woo me to his wife —</p>
   <p>HE ( bitterly ): With my tongue .</p>
   <p>SHE : Why came he not in his own glorious person ?</p>
   <p>HE : Lady , though a Duke , he hath his moments of wisdom and argueth thus : “ I , though a Duke , am yet a man . Thus , should I as Duke woo her , she may wed the Duke , loving not the man — ”</p>
   <p>SHE : And so he sent a Fool as his ambassador ! And so do I scorn this god-like Duke —</p>
   <p>HE : Ha ! Scorn him ! My lady — O Yolande , what of me ?</p>
   <p>She : Thou , false to him and faithless to thy trust , didst woo me for thyself which was ill in thee . But thou didst throw the terrible Red Gui into my lily-pool which was brave in thee . Thou didst endure chains and a prison undaunted which was noble in thee . Thou didst this night at peril of thy life save me from shame , but thou didst bear me urgently here into the wild , and in the wild here lie I beside thee , lost , yet warm and sleepy and safe beneath thy cloak — and so — ‘ tis very well —</p>
   <p>HE : Safe , Yolande ? Hath thy heart told thee this at last ? But thou didst fear me —</p>
   <p>SHE : Because to-night thou didst clasp me in cruel arms and spake me words of love passionate and fierce and — and —</p>
   <p>HE : Kissed thee , Yolande !</p>
   <p>SHE : Many times — O cruel ! And bore me hither and lost me in these dark solitudes ! Here was good cause for any maid to fear thee methinks .</p>
   <p>Yet thou didst basely mock my fears with thy hateful song of “ Derry down . ”</p>
   <p>HE : Because thy fears , being unjust , hurt me , for ah , Yolande , my love for thee is deep and true , and True-love is ever gentle and very humble .</p>
   <p>SHE : Thus do I fear thee no more , Joconde !</p>
   <p>HE : Because I am but lowly — a Fool beneath thy proud disdain ?</p>
   <p>SHE : Nay , Joconde . Because thou art indeed a very man . So now shall I sleep secure since nought of evil may come nigh me whiles I lie in thy care .</p>
   <p>Thus spake she softly ‘ mid the gloom , and turning upon her rustling couch sighed and presently fell to slumber .</p>
   <p>Now , sitting thus beside her as she slept , Jocelyn heard the stream ripple in the shadows like one that laughed soft but very joyously and , as he gazed up at the solitary star with eyes enraptured , this elfin laughter found its echo in his heart .</p>
   <p>A bird chirped drowsily from mazy thicket where sullen shadow thinned , little by little , until behind leaf and twig was a glimmer of light that waxed ever brighter . And presently amid this growing brightness was soft stir and twitter , sleepy chirpings changed to notes of wistful sweetness , a plaintive calling that was answered from afar .</p>
   <p>Thus the birds awaking sounded pretty warnings summoning each to each for that the day-spring was at hand , while ever the brightness changed to radiance and radiance to an orient glory and up flamed the sun in majesty and it was day . And now , from brake and thicket , from dewy mysteries of green boskage burst forth the sweet , glad chorus of bird-song , full throated , passionate of joy .</p>
   <p>And Jocelyn , sitting broad back against a tree , felt his soul uplifted thereby what time his eyes missed nothing of the beauties about him : the rugged boles of mighty trees bedappled with sunny splendour , the glittering dew that gemmed leaf and twig and fronded bracken , and the shapely loveliness of her who slumbered couched beneath his worn cloak , the gentle rise and fall of rounded bosom and the tress of hair that a fugitive sunbeam kissed to ruddy gold . Thus sat Jocelyn regardful , gladness in the heart of him , and a song of gladness bubbling to his lips .</p>
   <p>Suddenly he saw her lashes quiver , her rosy lips parted to a smile and , stirring in her slumber , she sighed and stretched shapely arms ; so waked she to a glory of sun and , starting to an elbow , gazed round , great-eyed , until espying him , she smiled again .</p>
   <p>“ Good morrow , Joconde ! Ne'er have I slept sweeter . But thou hast out-watched dark night and art a-weary , so shalt sleep awhile — ”</p>
   <p>“ Nay , ” he answered , “ a plunge in the stream yonder and I shall be blithe for the road — an we find one . And I do fear me thou'rt hungry , Yolande , and I have nought to give thee — ”</p>
   <p>“ And what of thyself , man ? Verily , I read hunger in thy look and weariness also , so , an thou may'st not eat , sleep thou shalt awhile here — in my place . ”</p>
   <p>“ Nay , Yolande , indeed — ”</p>
   <p>“ Yea , but thou must indeed whiles I watch over thee . ‘ Tis a sweet bed — come thy ways . ”</p>
   <p>“ And what wilt thou do ? ” he questioned .</p>
   <p>“ Much ! ” she answered , viewing her rumpled , gown with rueful eyes . “ As thou sayest , there is the pool yonder ! So come , get thee to bed and — sleep ! Come , let me cover thee with thy cloak and gainsay me not ; sleep thou must and shalt . ”</p>
   <p>So Duke Jocelyn stretched himself obediently upon the bed of fern and suffered her to cover him with the cloak ; but as she stooped above him thus , he lifted the hem of her dress to reverent lips .</p>
   <p>“ My lady ! ” he murmured . “ My dear lady ! ”</p>
   <p>“ Now close me thine eyes , wearied child ! ” she commanded . And , like a child , in this also he obeyed her , albeit unwillingly by reason of her radiant beauty , but hearing her beside him , was content , and thus presently fell to happy sleeping .</p>
   <p>When he awoke the sun was high and he lay awhile basking in this grateful radiance and joying in the pervading quiet ; but little by little , growing uneasy by reason of this stillness , he started up to glance about him and knew sudden dread — for the little glade was empty — Yolande had vanished ; moreover the horse was gone also .</p>
   <p>Cold with an awful fear he got him to his feet and looked hither and yon , but nowhere found any sign of violence or struggle . But like one distraught he turned to seek her , her name upon his lips , then , checking voice and movement , stood rigid , smitten by hateful doubt . For now it seemed to him that her gentle looks and words had been but sweet deceits to blind him to her purpose and now , so soon as she had lulled him to sleep , she had stolen away , leaving him for the poor , piteous fool he was . And now his despair was ‘ whelmed in sudden anger , and anger , little by little , changed to grief . She was fled away and he a sorry fool and very desolate .</p>
   <p>Full of these bitter thoughts he cast himself upon his face and , lying as in a pit of gloom , knew a great bitterness .</p>
   <p>Slowly , slowly , borne upon the gentle wind came a fragrance strange and unexpected , a savour delectable of cooking meat that made him know himself a man vastly hungry despite his grievous woe . But , lying within the black gulf of bitterness , he stirred not until , of a sudden , he heard a voice , rich and full and very sweet , upraised in joyous singing ; and these the words :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Rise , O laggard ! See the sun ,</l>
     <l n="2">To climb in glory hath begun :</l>
     <l n="3">The flowers have oped their pretty eyes ,</l>
     <l n="4">The happy lark doth songful rise ,</l>
     <l n="5">And merry birds in flowery brake ,</l>
     <l n="6">Full-throated , joyous clamours make ;</l>
     <l n="7">And I , indeed , that love it not ,</l>
     <l n="8">Do sit alone and keel the pot ,</l>
     <l n="9">Whiles thus I sing thee to entreat ,</l>
     <l n="10">O sleepy laggard — come and eat ! ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>“ Forsooth and art sleeping yet , Joconde ? ” the voice questioned . Duke Jocelyn lifted woeful head and saw her standing tall and shapely amid the leaves , fresh and sweet as the morn itself , with laughter within her dream-soft eyes and laughter on her vivid lips and the sun bright in the braided tresses of her hair wherein she had set wild flowers like jewels .</p>
   <p>“ Yolande ! ” he murmured , coming to his knees “ Yolande — how glorious thou art ! ”</p>
   <p>“ Nay , ” she laughed , yet flushing to the worship of his eyes , “ and my habit woefully torn of wicked bramble-thorns , and my hair ill-braided and all uncombed and — ”</p>
   <p>“ Ah , Yolande , I thought thee fled and I left to loneliness , and my pain was very sore . ”</p>
   <p>“ Then am I avenged thy mockery , Joconde , and thy song of ‘ Derry down . ’ ‘ Twas for this I stole away ! But now , if thou ‘ rt hungry man , come this ways . ” And she reached him her hand . So she brought him to a little dell where burned a fire of sticks beneath a pot whence stole right savoury odour .</p>
   <p>“ O most wonderful ! ” quoth he . “ Whence came these goodly viands ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Where but from the wallet behind thy horse 's saddle , Joconde ? ” Then down sat they forthwith side by side and ate heartily and were very blithe together ; and oft-times their looks would meet and they would fall silent awhile . At last , the meal ended , Jocelyn , turning from Yolande 's beauty to the beauty of the world around , spake soft-voiced :</p>
   <p>“ Yolande , were mine a selfish love , here , lost within these green solitudes , would I keep thee for mine own — to serve and worship thee unto my life 's end . But , since I count thy happiness above my dearest desires , now will I go saddle the horse and bear thee hence . ”</p>
   <p>“ Whither , Joconde , whither wilt thou bear me ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Back to the world , ” said he ruefully , “ thy world of prideful luxury , to thy kindred . ”</p>
   <p>“ But I have no kindred , alas ! ” sighed she , stooping to caress a daisy-flower that grew adjacent .</p>
   <p>“ Why , then , thy friends — ”</p>
   <p>“ My friends be very few , Joconde , and Benedicta hath her husband . ”</p>
   <p>“ Yolande , ” said he , leaning nearer , “ whither should I bear thee ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Nay , ” saith she , patting the daisy with gentle finger-tip , “ go thou and saddle thy horse , mayhap I shall know this anon . Go thou and saddle the horse . ” So Jocelyn arose and having saddled and bridled the horse , back he cometh to find Yolande on her knees beside the stream , and she , hearing his step , bowed her head , hiding her face from him ; now on the sward beside her lay the picture shattered beyond repair .</p>
   <p>“ How , ” said Jocelyn , “ hast broken the Duke 's picture , lady ! ”</p>
   <p>“ Thou seest ! ” she answered .</p>
   <p>“ And must thou weep therefore ? ” said he a little bitterly . “ Oh , be comforted ; ‘ t was but a toy — soon will I get thee another . ”</p>
   <p>“ An thou bring me another , Joconde , that will I break also . ”</p>
   <p>“ Ha — thou didst break it — wilfully , then ? ”</p>
   <p>“ With this stone , Joconde . ”</p>
   <p>“ Wherefore , O wherefore ? ” he questioned eagerly .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ For that it was but painted toy , even as thou sayest ! ” she answered .</l>
     <l n="2">“ Moreover , I — love not Duke Jocelyn . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">“ And't was for this thou didst break the picture ? ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="4">“ Nay , ‘ twas because these painted features may never compare with the face</l>
     <l n="5">of him I love . ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>“ And whom — whom dost thou love ? ” quoth he , in voice low and unsteady . Speaking not , she pointed with slender finger down into the placid , stream . Wondering , he bent to look and thus from the stilly water his mirrored image looked back at him ; now as he stooped so stooped she , and in this watery mirror their glances met .</p>
   <p>“ Yolande ? ” he whispered . “ O my lady , shall a Fool 's fond dream come true , or am I mad indeed ? Thou in thy beauty and I — ”</p>
   <p>“ Thou , Joconde , ” said she , fronting him with head proudly uplift , “ to my thought thou art man greater , nobler than any proud lord or mighty duke soever . And thou hast loved and wooed as never man wooed , methinks . And thou art so brave and strong and so very gentle and — thus it is — I do love thee . ”</p>
   <p>“ But my — my motley habit , my — ”</p>
   <p>“ Thy cap of Folly , Joconde , these garments pied thou hast dignified by thy very manhood , so are they dearer to me than lordly tire or knightly armour . And thy jingling bells — ah , Joconde , the jingle of thy bells hath waked within my heart that which shall never die — long time my heart hath cried for thee , and I , to my shame , heeded not the cry , wherefore here and now , thus upon my knees , I do most humbly confess my love . ”</p>
   <p>“ Thy love , Yolande — for me ? Then dost truly love me ? Oh , here is marvel beyond my understanding and belief . ”</p>
   <p>“ Why , Joconde , ah , why ? ”</p>
   <p>“ See ! ” he cried , flinging back his head . “ Look now upon this blemished face — here where the cruel sun may shew thee all my ugliness , every scar — behold ! How may one so beautiful as thou learn love for one so lowly and with face thus hatefully marred ? I have watched thee shrink from me ere now ! I mind how , beside the lily-pool within thy garden , thou didst view me with eyes of horror ! I do mind thy very words — the first that e'er I heard thee utter :</p>
   <p>‘ What thing art thou that ‘ neath thy hood doth show A visage that might shame the gladsome day ? ’</p>
   <p>Yolande , Yolande , this poor blemished face is nothing changed since then ; such as I was , such I am ! ”</p>
   <p>“ Alas , Joconde ! ” she cried , reaching out her hands in passionate appeal . “ My words were base , cruel — and hurt me now more , ah , much more , than e'er they wounded thee . For I do love thee with love as deep , as true as is thine own ! Wilt not believe me ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Oh , that I might indeed ! ” he groaned . “ But — thou'rt alone , far from thy home and friends , thy wonted pride and state forgotten all — mayhap thou dost pity me or mayhap ‘ tis thy gratitude in guise of love doth speak me thus ? But as thou art still thine own lovely self , so am I that same poor , motley Fool whose hateful face — ”</p>
   <p>“ Joconde , ” she cried , “ hush thee — Oh , hush thee ! Thy words are whips to lash me ! ” and catching his hand she kissed it and cherished it ‘ gainst tear-wet cheek . “ Ah , Joconde , ” she sighed , “ so wise and yet so foolish , know'st thou not thy dear , scarred face is the face of him I love , for love hath touched my eyes and I do see thee at last as thou truly art , a man great of soul , tender and strong-hearted . So art thou a man , the only man , my man . Oh , that I might but prove my love for thee , prove it to thee and before all men , no matter how , so I might but banish thy cruel doubts for ever . But now , for thy dear , scarred face — ”</p>
   <p>Her soft , round arms were about his neck ; and drawing him to her lips she kissed him , his scarred brow and cheek , his eyes , his lips grown dumb with wondering joy . Thus , lip to lip and with arms entwined , knelt they beside that slow-moving stream that whispered softly beneath the bank and gurgled roguish laughter in the shallows .</p>
   <p>A dog barked faintly in the distance , a frog croaked hoarsely from the neighbouring sedge , but lost in the wonder of their love , they heeded only the beating of their hearts .</p>
   <p>“ A-billing and a-cooing ! A-cooing and a-billing , as I 'm a tanner true ! ” exclaimed a hoarse voice . Up started Jocelyn , fierce-eyed and with hand on dagger-hilt , to behold a man with shock of red hair , a man squat and burly who , leaning on bow-stave , peered at them across the stream .</p>
   <p>“ And is it Will the Tanner ? ” quoth Jocelyn , loosing his dagger .</p>
   <p>“ None else , friend Motley . ”</p>
   <p>“ Why then , God keep thee ! And now go about thy business . ”</p>
   <p>“ Marry , Fool , I am about my business , the which is to find thee . By Saint Nick , there 's mighty hue and cry for thee up and down within the greenwood , aye — marry is there , as I 'm a tanner tried and true . So needs must thou along wi ’ me . ”</p>
   <p>“ With thee , Tanner ? And wherefore ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Why , I know not wherefore , Fool , but must along . Here 's me and Lob and the potent hag that is Mopsa the Witch , lain a-watching and a-watching ye a-billing — nay , scowl not , friend Fool , on tanner trusty , tried and true . For hark now , here 's great stir , clamour and to-do within this forest-country for thee , Fool , the which is strange , seeing thou art but a motley fool . Howbeit there be many great lords and knights from beyond the Southern March a-seeking of thee , Fool . ”</p>
   <p>“ Ha ! ” quoth Jocelyn , frowning . “ Envoys from Brocelaunde ! ”</p>
   <p>“ Alas , Joconde , and seeking thee ! ” saith Yolande in troubled voice .</p>
   <p>“ Moreover , ” continued Will , “ here 's our Duke Pertinax and his lady Duchess yearning for thee , here 's Robin that is Sir Robert a-clamouring for thee and all his goodly foresters , as myself , a-seeking thee . ”</p>
   <p>“ But't is I found thee , Sir Long-legged Fool , I — I ! ” croaked a voice , and old Mopsa the Witch peered at them from a bush hard by .</p>
   <p>“ Verily , thou hast found us ! ” quoth Jocelyn ruefully . “ And what now ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Oho ! ” cried the Witch , cracking her finger-bones . “ Now go I hot-foot to weave spells and enchantments , aha — oho ! Spells that shall prove the false from the true , the gold from the dross . Thou , Sir Fool , art doubting lover , so art thou blind lover ! I will resolve thee thy doubts , open thy eyes and show thee great joy or bitter sorrow — oho ! Thou , proud lady , hast stooped to love a motley mountebank — nay , flash not thy bright eyes nor toss haughty head at an old woman — but here is solitude with none to mock thy lowly choice or cry thee shame to love a motley Fool , aha ! And thou would'st fain prove thy love True-love , says thou ? Why , so thou shalt — beyond all doubting now and for ever , aha — oho ! Truest of true or falsest of false . Beware . Farewell , and remember :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Follow Folly and be wise ,</l>
     <l n="2">In such folly wisdom lies ,</l>
     <l n="3">Love 's blind , they say ; but Love hath eyes ,</l>
     <l n="4">So follow Folly , follow .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Hither-ho , Lob-Lobkyn ! Lend thine old granddam thine arm . Come , my pretty bantling , sweet poppet — come and — away ! ” o spake old Mopsa the Witch , and vanished into the green with Lobkyn , who turned to flourish his club in cheery salutation ere he plunged into the underbrush . Then Jocelyn smiled down on Yolande to find her pale and trembling , so would he have clasped her to his heart , but a hand grasped him and , turning , he beheld the Tanner at his elbow .</p>
   <p>“ Friend Fool , ” quoth he , “ needs must I take thee to Robin that Sir Robert is , e'en as he did command , so come now thy ways with trusty tanner tried . ”</p>
   <p>“ Off , Red-head ! ” saith Jocelyn , frowning a little . “ Away now , lest this my dagger bite thee . ” Back leapt Will into the stream whence he had come , and there standing , clapped bugle to lip and winded it lustily , whereupon came divers fellows running , bow in hand , who beset Jocelyn on every side .</p>
   <p>“ Now yield thee to Tanner , friend , ” quoth Will , knee-deep in the stream , “ for no mind have I to hurt thee . So away with thy dagger like gentle , kindly Fool , and away with thee to Sir Robin . ”</p>
   <p>Now hereupon , as Jocelyn frowned upon them , Yolande , standing a-tiptoe , kissed his scarred cheek and clasped his dagger-hand in soft fingers .</p>
   <p>“ Come , ” she pleaded , “ they be a-many , so yield me thy dagger and let us go with them , beloved ! ” At the whispered word Jocelyn loosed the dagger and , clasping her instead , kissed her full-lipped . Then turned he to his captors .</p>
   <p>“ I 'm with thee , Will , thou — tanner ! ” quoth he . “ And now bring hither the horse for my lady 's going . ”</p>
   <p>“ Nay , ” answered Will , scratching red head , “ Rob — Sir Robert spake nothing of horse for thee , or lady . ”</p>
   <p>“ Nor will I ride , Joconde , ” she murmured happily , “ rather will I trudge beside thee , my hand in thine — thus ! ”</p>
   <p>So , hand in hand , they went close-guarded by their captors yet heeding them not at all , having eyes but for each other . And oft her cheek flushed rosy beneath his look , and oft he thrilled to the warm , close pressure of her fingers ; and thus tramped they happy in their captivity .</p>
   <p>The sun rose high and higher , but since for them their captors were not , neither was fatigue ; and , if the way was rough there was Jocelyn 's ready hand , while for him swamps and brooks were a joy since he might bear her in his arms . Thus tramped they by shady dingle and sunny glade , through marshy hollows and over laughing rills , until the men began to mutter their discontent , in especial a swart , hairy wight , and Will , glancing up at the sun , spake :</p>
   <p>“ Two hours , lads , judge I . ”</p>
   <p>“ Nigher three , Tanner , nigher three ! ” growled the chief mutterer .</p>
   <p>“ Why so much the better , Rafe , though two was the word . Howbeit we be come far enow , I judge , and ‘ tis hot I judge , so hey for Robin — and a draught o ’ perry ! ”</p>
   <p>“ Art thou weary , my Yolande ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Nay , is not thy dear arm about me ! ”</p>
   <p>“ And — thou dost love me indeed ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Indeed , Joconde ! Mine is a love that ever groweth — ”</p>
   <p>A horn 's shrill challenge ; a sound of voices , and below them opened a great , green hollow , shady with trees beneath whose shade were huts of wattle cunningly wrought , a brook that flowed sparkling , and beyond caves hollowed in the steepy bank .</p>
   <p>“ How now , Tanner Will , ” questioned Jocelyn , “ hast brought us to the outlaw 's refuge ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Not so , good friend-Fool , not outlaws , foresters we of Duke Pertinax , and yonder , look ‘ ee , cometh Rob — Sir Robert to greet ye ! ” And the Tanner pointed where one came running , a man long of leg , long of arm and very bright of eye , a goodly man clad in hood and jerkin of neat 's leather as aforetime , only now his bugle swung from baldrick of gold and silver and in his hood was brooched a long scarlet feather .</p>
   <p>“ What brother ! ” cried he joyously . “ By saint Nicholas ,' tis sweet to see thee again , thou lovely Fool ! ” And he clasped Jocelyn in brotherly embrace , which done , he stood off and shook doleful head . “ Alas , brother ! ” quoth he . “ Alas ! my prisoner art thou this day , wherefor I grieve , and wherefor I know not save that it is by my lady Benedicta 's strict command and her I must obey . ” And now , turning to Yolande , he bared his head , louting full low . “ Lady , ” quoth he , “ by thy rare and so great beauty I do know thee for Yolande the Fair , so do we of the wild give thee humble greeting . Here may'st thou rest awhile ere we bring thee to Canalise . ”</p>
   <p>“ But , messire , ” answered Yolande , clasping Jocelyn 's hand , “ no mind have I to go to Canalise . ”</p>
   <p>“ Then alack for me , fair lady , for needs must I carry thee there within the hour along of my motley brother . Meanwhile here within yon bower thou shalt find cushions to thy repose , and all things to thy comfort and refreshment . ”</p>
   <p>“ O Sir Robert ! O for a comb ! ” she sighed .</p>
   <p>“ Expectant it waiteth thee , lady , together with water cool , sweet-perfumed essences , unguents and other nice , lady-like toys . Moreover , there be mirrors two of Venice and in pretty coffer — ” But Yolande had vanished .</p>
   <p>Hereupon Robin led the way into a cool , arras-hung cave where was table set out with divers comfortable things both eatable and drinkable .</p>
   <p>Quoth Jocelyn , hunger and thirst appeased : “ And now good Robin , what do these envoys from Brocelaunde ? Why am I thy prisoner and wherefore must I to Canalise ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Ha ! ” saith Robin , cocking merry eye , “ and thy name is Joconde , the which is an excellent name , brother , and suiteth thee well , and yet — hum ! Howbeit , friend , remember Robin loved thee for the Fool he found thee , that same Fool foolish enow to spare a rogue his life . Dost mind my Song o ’ Rogues ? A good song , methinks , tripping merrily o ’ the tongue :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ ‘ I 'll sing a song</l>
     <l n="2">Not over long ,</l>
     <l n="3">A song o ’ roguery ,</l>
     <l n="4">For I 'm a rogue ,</l>
     <l n="5">And thou'rt a rogue ,</l>
     <l n="6">And so , in faith is he . ’</l>
   </lg>
   <p>I mind thy fierce , hawk-nosed gossip in rusty jack and ragged cloak , his curses ! Troth brother ,' tis a world of change methinks , this same fierce , cursing , hook-nose rogue a noble knight and to-day my lord Duke ! I , that was poor outlaw , knight-at-arms and lord warden , and thou — a motley Fool still — and my prisoner . How say'st thou , brother ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Why I say , Robin , that my three questions wait thy answers ! ”</p>
   <p>“ Verily , brother , and for this reason . I am a knight and noble , and so being have learned me policy , and my policy is , when unable to give answer direct to question direct , to question myself direct thus directing question to questions other or to talk of matters of interest universal , so do I of thyself and myself speak . And talking of myself I have on myself , of myself , of myself made a song , and these the words , hark ‘ ee :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Now Rob that was Robin Sir Robert is hight</l>
     <l n="2">Though Rob oft did rob when outlaw ,</l>
     <l n="3">Since outlaw now in law is dubbed a good knight ,</l>
     <l n="4">Robin 's robbing is done , Rob robbeth no more .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Fair words brother , I think , and yet a little sad . ‘ But , ’ says you in vasty amaze , ‘ my very noble and right potent Sir Robert , ’ says you , ‘ if thou art indeed noble knight , wherefore go ye devoid of mail , surcoat , cyclas , crested helm , banderol , lance , shield and the like pomps and gauds ? ’ ‘ Brother , ’ says I , ‘ habit is habit and habit sticketh habitual , and my habit is to go habited as suiteth my habit , suiting habit o ’ body to habit o ’ mind . ’ Thus I , though Sir Robert , am Robin still , and go in soft leather ‘ stead of chafing steel , and my rogues , loving Robin , love Sir Robert the better therefor , as sayeth my song in fashion apt and pertinent :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Since habit is habit , my habit hath been</l>
     <l n="2">To wear habit habitually comely —</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Ha , there soundeth the mustering note , so must we away and I sing no further , which is well , for ‘ comely ’ is an ill word to rhyme with . Howbeit here must I , beginning my song o ’ Robin , of beginning must Rob make an end , for duty calleth Sir Robert , so must Robin away . ”</p>
   <p>Hereupon he clapped horn to lip at which shrill summons came archers and pikemen ranked very orderly about a fair horse-litter . But Yolande coming radiant from the bower and espying the litter , shook her head . Quoth she :</p>
   <p>“ An thou go afoot , Joconde , so will I . ”</p>
   <p>The sun was low when they came before the walls of Canalise , and passing beneath grim portcullis and through frowning gateway , with ring and tramp , crossed the wide market square a-throng with jostling townsfolk , who laughed and pointed , cheered and hooted , staring amain at Jocelyn in his threadbare motley ; but Yolande , fronting all eyes with proud head aloft , drew nearer and held his hand in firmer clasp .</p>
   <p>Thus they came at last to the great courtyard before the palace , bright with the glitter of steel , where men-at-arms stood mustered . Here Robin halted his company , whereon rose the silvery note of a clarion , and forth paced the dignified Chief Herald , who spake him full-toned and sonorous :</p>
   <p>“ In the name of our potent Duke Pertinax and his gracious lady Benedicta , I greet thee well , Sir Robert-a-Forest . Now whom bring ye here ? Pronounce ! ”</p>
   <p>“ Dan Merriment , Sir Gravity , ” answered Robin , “ a Fool valiant and wise , a maker of songs , of quips and quiddities many and jocund , Joconde hight . Sir Wisdom , Folly behold , himself here in propriâ personâ . ”</p>
   <p>The Chief Herald gestured haughtily with his wand whereupon forth stepped a file of soldiers and surrounded Jocelyn .</p>
   <p>“ Ah , Joconde ! What meaneth this ? ” said Yolande , in troubled voice .</p>
   <p>“ Indeed , my lady , I know not ! ” he answered . “ But let not thy brave heart fail thee . ”</p>
   <p>“ Ah , Joconde , I fear for thee — whither would they lead thee ? Nay , sweet heaven , they shall not take thee from me ! ”</p>
   <p>“ Fear not , beloved , though they part us awhile . ”</p>
   <p>“ Away with the Motley ! ” thundered the Chief Herald , flourishing his wand .</p>
   <p>“ Yolande — O my beloved , fear not — ” But even as he spake , the pikemen closed in , and Jocelyn was hustled away ; so stood she trembling , hands clasped and eyes wide and fearful , until tall motley figure and flaunting cock'shYpppHeNcomb were lost to her sight and the jingle of his bells had died away ; then , finding herself alone and all men 's eyes upon her , she lifted bowed head and stood white-cheeked and proudly patient , waiting for what might betide .</p>
   <p>And presently was distant stir that , growing nearer , swelled to the ring and clash of armour and the trampling of many hoofs ; and presently through the great gateway rode many knights sumptuously caparisoned , their shields brave with gilded ‘ scutcheons , pennon and bannerole a-flutter above nodding plumes , and over all the Red Raven banner of Brocelaunde . So rode they two-and-two until the great courtyard blazed with flashing steel and broidered surcoats . And now a trumpet blared , and forth before this glorious array a pursuivant rode and halted to behold Pertinax , who stepped forth of the great banqueting-hall leading his fair Duchess by the hand , and behind them courtiers and ladies attendant .</p>
   <p>Once again the trumpets rang , and lifting his hand , the pursuivant spake :</p>
   <p>“ My Lord Duke Pertinax , most gracious Duchess , Jocelyn the high and mighty Lord Duke of Brocelaunde greeteth you in all love and amity , and hither rideth to claim a fair lady to wife . Behold our Lord Duke Jocelyn ! ”</p>
   <p>Loud and long the trumpets blew as into the courtyard rode a single horseman ; tall was he and bedight in plain black armour and white surcoat whereon the Red Raven glowed ; but his face was hid in vizored helm . So rode he through his glorious array of knights , checking his fiery steed to gentle gait with practised hand , while thus spake the pursuivant :</p>
   <p>“ Behold here Jocelyn , Duke of Brocelaunde , to claim this day in marriage the Lady Yolande according to her word . ”</p>
   <p>“ Stay , my lords ! ” cried a sweet , clear voice , and forth before them all stood Yolande herself , pale-cheeked but stately of bearing and very bright of eye .</p>
   <p>“ Be it known to all here that I , Yolande , have given neither pledge nor troth unto Duke Jocelyn — ”</p>
   <p>Now here was silence sudden and profound that none dared break saving only the haughty Chief Herald .</p>
   <p>“ How lady , how , ” quoth he , “ no pledge , no troth , quotha — ”</p>
   <p>“ Neither one nor other , messire , nor shall there ever be — ”</p>
   <p>“ Here is madness , lady , madness — ”</p>
   <p>“ Here is truth , messire , truth ; I may not pledge my troth with Duke Jocelyn since I have this day pledged myself unto Duke Jocelyn 's jester — ”</p>
   <p>“ Jester , lady , jester ? Venus aid us — Cupid shield us ! A jester , a Fool , a motley mountebank , a — ”</p>
   <p>“ Aye ! ” cried Yolande . “ All this is he , my lords . Very humble and lowly — yet do I love him ! Oh , ‘ tis joy — ‘ tis joy to thus confess my love — his cap and bells and motley livery are fairer to me than velvet mantle or knightly armour ; he is but humble jester , a Fool for men 's scorn or laughter , yet is he a man , so do I love him and so am I his — unto the end . My lords , I have no more to say save this — give me my jester — this man I love — and suffer us to go forth hand in hand together , even as we came . ”</p>
   <p>The Duchess Benedicta uttered a soft , glad cry , and seizing her husband 's arm , shook it for very joy . But now , as Yolande fronted them all , pale and proudly defiant , was the ring of a mailed foot , and turning , she shrank trembling to see Duke Jocelyn hasting toward her , his black armour glinting , his embroidered surcoat fluttering , his long arms outstretched to her ; thus quick-striding he came but , even as she put out shaking hands to stay him , he fell upon his knee before her .</p>
   <p>“ Most brave and noble lady — beloved Yolande , ” he cried , and lifted his vizor . Now beholding the scarred face of him , the tender , smiling lips , the adoration in his grey eyes , she trembled amain and , swaying to him , rested her hands on his mailed shoulders .</p>
   <p>“ Joconde , ” she whispered , “ ah , Joconde — what dream is this ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Nay , beloved , the dream is ended and findeth me here at thy feet . The dream is past and we do wake at last , for thy motley Fool , thy Duke and lover am I , yet lover most of all . And thou who in thy divine mercy stooped to love the Fool , by that same love shalt thou lift Duke Jocelyn up to thee and heaven at last . And Oh , methinks the memory of thy so great and noble love shall be a memory fragrant everlastingly . ”</p>
   <p>So speaking , Duke Jocelyn rose , and with her hand fast in his , looked from her loveliness round about him , blithe of eye .</p>
   <p>“ My lords , ” cried he , “ behold my well-beloved , brave-hearted lady . Nobles of Brocelaunde , salute your Duchess Yolande . ”</p>
   <p>Hereupon was shout on shout of joyous acclaim , lost all at once in the sweet , glad clamour of bells pealing near and far ; so , hand in hand , while the air thrilled with this merry riot , they crossed the wide courtyard , and she flushed ‘ neath the worship of his look and he thrilled to the close , warm pressure of her fingers — thus walked they betwixt the ranks of men-at-arms and glittering chivalry , yet saw them not .</p>
   <p>But now Yolande was aware of Benedicta 's arms about her and Benedicta 's voice in her ear .</p>
   <p>“ Dear my Yolande , so True-love hath found thee at last since thou wert brave indeed and worthy . Come now and let me deck thee to thy bridal . ”</p>
   <p>“ Lord Duke , ” quoth Pertinax , “ here methinks was notable , worthy wooing . ”</p>
   <p>“ Aha ! ” quoth Mopsa the Witch , crackling her knuckle-bones . “ Here , my children , is wooing that some fool shall strive to tell tale of some day , mayhap ; but such love is beyond words and not to be told . Thus by cunning contrivement hath Mopsa the old Witch proved the true from the false , the gold from the dross ; thou , my lady , hast proved thy love indeed , and thou , Lord Duke , may nevermore doubt such love . And now away and wed each other to love 's fulfilment — hark where the bells do summon ye . ”</p>
   <p>And thus , as evening fell , they were wed within the great Minster of Canalise , and thereafter came they to the banqueting-hall with retinue of knights and nobles . Last of all strode Robin with his foresters , and as they marched he sang a song he had learned of Jocelyn , and these the words :</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ What is love ? ‘ Tis this , I say ,</l>
     <l n="2">Flower that springeth in a day ,</l>
     <l n="3">Ne'er to die or fade away ,</l>
     <l n="4">Since True-love dieth never .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">“ Though youth alas ! too soon shall wane ,</l>
     <l n="6">Though friend prove false and effort vain ,</l>
     <l n="7">True-love all changeless shall remain</l>
     <l n="8">The same to-day and ever . ”</l>
    </lg>
