    <head>INTRODUCTION</head>
    <p n="1">It is at my persuasion that these poems are now published . The earliest of them were read to me in London in 1896 , when the writer was seventeen ; the later ones were sent to me from India in 1904 , when she was twenty-five ; and they belong , I think , almost wholly to those two periods . As they seemed to me to have an individual beauty of their own , I thought they ought to be published . The writer hesitated . “ Your letter made me very proud and very sad , ” she wrote . “ Is it possible that I have written verses that are ‘ filled with beauty , ’ and is it possible that you really think them worthy of being given to the world ? You know how high my ideal of Art is ; and to me my poor casual little poems seem to be less than beautiful — I mean with that final enduring beauty that I desire . ” And , in another letter , she writes : “ I am not a poet really . I have the vision and the desire , but not the voice . If I could write just one poem full of beauty and the spirit of greatness , I should be exultantly silent for ever ; but I sing just as the birds do , and my songs are as ephemeral . ” It is for this bird-like quality of song , it seems to me , that they are to be valued . They hint , in a sort of delicately evasive way , at a rare temperament , the temperament of a woman of the East , finding expression through a Western language and under partly Western influences . They do not express the whole of that temperament ; but they express , I think , its essence ; and there is an Eastern magic in them .</p>
    <p n="2">Sarojini Chattopadhyay was born at Hyderabad on February 13 , 1879 . Her father , Dr. Aghorenath Chattopadhyay , is descended from the ancient family of Chattorajes of Bhramangram , who were noted throughout Eastern Bengal as patrons of Sanskrit learning , and for their practice of Yoga . He took his degree of Doctor of Science at the University of Edinburgh in 1877 , and afterwards studied brilliantly at Bonn . On his return to India he founded the Nizam College at Hyderabad , and has since laboured incessantly , and at great personal sacrifice , in the cause of education .</p>
    <p n="3">Sarojini was the eldest of a large family , all of whom were taught English at an early age . “ I , ” she writes , “ was stubborn and refused to speak it . So one day when I was nine years old my father punished me — the only time I was ever punished — by shutting me in a room alone for a whole day . I came out of it a full-blown linguist . I have never spoken any other language to him , or to my mother , who always speaks to me in Hindustani . I do n't think I had any special hankering to write poetry as a little child , though I was of a very fanciful and dreamy nature . My training under my father 's eye was of a sternly scientific character . He was determined that I should be a great mathematician or a scientist , but the poetic instinct , which I inherited from him and also from my mother ( who wrote some lovely Bengali lyrics in her youth ) proved stronger . One day , when I was eleven , I was sighing over a sum in algebra : it WOULDN'T come right ; but instead a whole poem came to me suddenly . I wrote it down .</p>
    <p n="4">“ From that day my ‘ poetic career ’ began . At thirteen I wrote a long poem a la ‘ Lady of the Lake ’ — 1300 lines in six days . At thirteen I wrote a drama of 2000 lines , a full-fledged passionate thing that I began on the spur of the moment without forethought , just to spite my doctor who said I was very ill and must not touch a book . My health broke down permanently about this time , and my regular studies being stopped I read voraciously . I suppose the greater part of my reading was done between fourteen and sixteen . I wrote a novel , I wrote fat volumes of journals ; I took myself very seriously in those days . ”</p>
    <p n="5">Before she was fifteen the great struggle of her life began . Dr. Govindurajulu Naidu , now her husband , is , though of an old and honourable family , not a Brahmin . The difference of caste roused an equal opposition , not only on the side of her family , but of his ; and in 1895 she was sent to England , against her will , with a special scholarship from the Nizam . She remained in England , with an interval of travel in Italy , till 1898 , studying first at King 's College , London , then , till her health again broke down , at Girton . She returned to Hyderabad in September 1898 , and in the December of that year , to the scandal of all India , broke through the bonds of caste , and married Dr. Naidu . “ Do you know I have some very beautiful poems floating in the air , ” she wrote to me in 1904 ; “ and if the gods are kind I shall cast my soul like a net and capture them , this year . If the gods are kind — and grant me a little measure of health . It is all I need to make my life perfect , for the very ‘ Spirit of Delight ’ that Shelley wrote of dwells in my little home ; it is full of the music of birds in the garden and children in the long arched verandah . ” There are songs about the children in this book ; they are called the Lord of Battles , the Sun of Victory , the Lotus-born , and the Jewel of Delight .</p>
    <p n="6">“ My ancestors for thousands of years , ” I find written in one of her letters , “ have been lovers of the forest and mountain caves , great dreamers , great scholars , great ascetics . My father is a dreamer himself , a great dreamer , a great man whose life has been a magnificent failure . I suppose in the whole of India there are few men whose learning is greater than his , and I do n't think there are many men more beloved . He has a great white beard and the profile of Homer , and a laugh that brings the roof down . He has wasted all his money on two great objects : to help others , and on alchemy . He holds huge courts every day in his garden of all the learned men of all religions — Rajahs and beggars and saints and downright villains all delightfully mixed up , and all treated as one . And then his alchemy ! Oh dear , night and day the experiments are going on , and every man who brings a new prescription is welcome as a brother . But this alchemy is , you know , only the material counterpart of a poet 's craving for Beauty , the eternal Beauty . ‘ The makers of gold and the makers of verse , ’ they are the twin creators that sway the world 's secret desire for mystery ; and what in my father is the genius of curiosity — the very essence of all scientific genius — in me is the desire for beauty . Do you remember Pater 's phrase about Leonardo da Vinci , ‘ curiosity and the desire of beauty ’ ? ”</p>
    <p n="7">It was the desire of beauty that made her a poet ; her “ nerves of delight ” were always quivering at the contact of beauty . To those who knew her in England , all the life of the tiny figure seemed to concentrate itself in the eyes ; they turned towards beauty as the sunflower turns towards the sun , opening wider and wider until one saw nothing but the eyes .</p>
    <p n="8">She was dressed always in clinging dresses of Eastern silk , and as she was so small , and her long black hair hung straight down her back , you might have taken her for a child . She spoke little , and in a low voice , like gentle music ; and she seemed , wherever she was , to be alone .</p>
    <p n="9">Through that soul I seemed to touch and take hold upon the East . And first there was the wisdom of the East . I have never known any one who seemed to exist on such “ large draughts of intellectual day ” as this child of seventeen , to whom one could tell all one 's personal troubles and agitations , as to a wise old woman . In the East , maturity comes early ; and this child had already lived through all a woman 's life . But there was something else , something hardly personal , something which belonged to a consciousness older than the Christian , which I realised , wondered at , and admired , in her passionate tranquillity of mind , before which everything mean and trivial and temporary caught fire and burnt away in smoke . Her body was never without suffering , or her heart without conflict ; but neither the body 's weakness nor the heart 's violence could disturb that fixed contemplation , as of Buddha on his lotus-throne .</p>
    <p n="10">And along with this wisdom , as of age or of the age of a race , there was what I can hardly call less than an agony of sensation . Pain or pleasure transported her , and the whole of pain or pleasure might be held in a flower 's cup or the imagined frown of a friend . It was never found in those things which to others seemed things of importance . At the age of twelve she passed the Matriculation of the Madras University , and awoke to find herself famous throughout India . “ Honestly , ” she said to me , “ I was not pleased ; such things did not appeal to me . ” But here , in a letter from Hyderabad , bidding one “ share a March morning ” with her , there is , at the mere contact of the sun , this outburst : “ Come and share my exquisite March morning with me : this sumptuous blaze of gold and sapphire sky ; these scarlet lilies that adorn the sunshine ; the voluptuous scents of neem and champak and serisha that beat upon the languid air with their implacable sweetness ; the thousand little gold and blue and silver breasted birds bursting with the shrill ecstasy of life in nesting time . All is hot and fierce and passionate , ardent and unashamed in its exulting and importunate desire for life and love . And , do you know that the scarlet lilies are woven petal by petal from my heart 's blood , these little quivering birds are my soul made incarnate music , these heavy perfumes are my emotions dissolved into aerial essence , this flaming blue and gold sky is the ‘ very me , ’ that part of me that incessantly and insolently , yes , and a little deliberately , triumphs over that other part — a thing of nerves and tissues that suffers and cries out , and that must die to-morrow perhaps , or twenty years hence . ”</p>
    <p n="11">Then there was her humour , which was part of her strange wisdom , and was always awake and on the watch . In all her letters , written in exquisite English prose , but with an ardent imagery and a vehement sincerity of emotion which make them , like the poems , indeed almost more directly , un-English , Oriental , there was always this intellectual , critical sense of humour , which could laugh at one 's own enthusiasm as frankly as that enthusiasm had been set down . And partly the humour , like the delicate reserve of her manner , was a mask or a shelter . “ I have taught myself , ” she writes to me from India , “ to be commonplace and like everybody else superficially . Every one thinks I am so nice and cheerful , so ‘ brave , ’ all the banal things that are so comfortable to be . My mother knows me only as ‘ such a tranquil child , but so strong-willed . ’ A tranquil child ! ” And she writes again , with deeper significance : “ I too have learnt the subtle philosophy of living from moment to moment . Yes , it is a subtle philosophy , though it appears merely an epicurean doctrine : ‘ Eat , drink , and be merry , for to-morrow we die . ’ I have gone through so many yesterdays when I strove with Death that I have realised to its full the wisdom of that sentence ; and it is to me not merely a figure of speech , but a literal fact . Any to-morrow I might die . It is scarcely two months since I came back from the grave : is it worth while to be anything but radiantly glad ? Of all things that life or perhaps my temperament has given me I prize the gift of laughter as beyond price . ”</p>
    <p n="12">Her desire , always , was to be “ a wild free thing of the air like the birds , with a song in my heart . ” A spirit of too much fire in too frail a body , it was rarely that her desire was fully granted . But in Italy she found what she could not find in England , and from Italy her letters are radiant . “ This Italy is made of gold , ” she writes from Florence , “ the gold of dawn and daylight , the gold of the stars , and , now dancing in weird enchanting rhythms through this magic month of May , the gold of fireflies in the perfumed darkness — ‘ aerial gold . ’ I long to catch the subtle music of their fairy dances and make a poem with a rhythm like the quick irregular wild flash of their sudden movements . Would it not be wonderful ? One black night I stood in a garden with fireflies in my hair like darting restless stars caught in a mesh of darkness . It gave me a strange sensation , as if I were not human at all , but an elfin spirit . I wonder why these little things move me so deeply ? It is because I have a most ‘ unbalanced intellect , ’ I suppose . ” Then , looking out on Florence , she cries , “ God ! how beautiful it is , and how glad I am that I am alive to-day ! ” And she tells me that she is drinking in the beauty like wine , “ wine , golden and scented , and shining , fit for the gods ; and the gods have drunk it , the dead gods of Etruria , two thousand years ago . Did I say dead ? No , for the gods are immortal , and one might still find them loitering in some solitary dell on the grey hillsides of Fiesole . Have I seen them ? Yes , looking with dreaming eyes , I have found them sitting under the olives , in their grave , strong , antique beauty — Etruscan gods ! ”</p>
    <p n="13">In Italy she watches the faces of the monks , and at one moment longs to attain to their peace by renunciation , longs for Nirvana ; “ then , when one comes out again into the hot sunshine that warms one 's blood , and sees the eager hurrying faces of men and women in the street , dramatic faces over which the disturbing experiences of life have passed and left their symbols , one 's heart thrills up into one 's throat . No , no , no , a thousand times no ! how can one deliberately renounce this coloured , unquiet , fiery human life of the earth ? ” And , all the time , her subtle criticism is alert , and this woman of the East marvels at the women of the West , “ the beautiful worldly women of the West , ” whom she sees walking in the Cascine , “ taking the air so consciously attractive in their brilliant toilettes , in the brilliant coquetry of their manner ! ” She finds them “ a little incomprehensible , ” “ profound artists in all the subtle intricacies of fascination , ” and asks if these “ incalculable frivolities and vanities and coquetries and caprices ” are , to us , an essential part of their charm ? And she watches them with amusement as they flutter about her , petting her as if she were a nice child , a child or a toy , not dreaming that she is saying to herself sorrowfully : “ How utterly empty their lives must be of all spiritual beauty IF they are nothing more than they appear to be . ”</p>
    <p n="14">She sat in our midst , and judged us , and few knew what was passing behind that face “ like an awakening soul , ” to use one of her own epithets . Her eyes were like deep pools , and you seemed to fall through them into depths below depths .</p>

Come , let us gather our nets from the shore , and set our catamarans free , To capture the leaping wealth of the tide , for we are the sons of the sea .</p>
     <p>No longer delay , let us hasten away in the track of the sea-gull 's call , The sea is our mother , the cloud is our brother , the waves are our comrades all . What though we toss at the fall of the sun where the hand of the sea-god drives ? He who holds the storm by the hair , will hide in his breast our lives .</p>
     <p>Sweet is the shade of the cocoanut glade , and the scent of the mango grove , And sweet are the sands at the full o ’ the moon with the sound of the voices we love . But sweeter , O brothers , the kiss of the spray and the dance of the wild foam 's glee : Row , brothers , row to the blue of the verge , where the low sky mates with the sea .</p>

     <p>A kokila called from a henna-spray : LIRA ! LIREE ! LIRA ! LIREE ! Hasten , maidens , hasten away To gather the leaves of the henna-tree . Send your pitchers afloat on the tide , Gather the leaves ere the dawn be old , Grind them in mortars of amber and gold , The fresh green leaves of the henna-tree .</p>
     <p>A kokila called from a henna-spray : LIRA ! LIREE ! LIRA ! LIREE ! Hasten maidens , hasten away To gather the leaves of the henna-tree .

     <p>The scents of red roses and sandalwood flutter and die in the maze of their gem-tangled hair , And smiles are entwining like magical serpents the poppies of lips that are opiate-sweet ; Their glittering garments of purple are burning like tremulous dawns in the quivering air , And exquisite , subtle and slow are the tinkle and tread of their rhythmical , slumber-soft feet .</p>
     <p>Now silent , now singing and swaying and swinging , like blossoms that bend to the breezes or showers , Now wantonly winding , they flash , now they falter , and , lingering , languish in radiant choir ; Their jewel-girt arms and warm , wavering , lily-long fingers enchant through melodious hours , Eyes ravished with rapture , celestially panting , what passionate bosoms aflaming with fire !</p>
