     <head>THE PRAIRIE</head>
     <lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="2">The City ? Oh , yes , the City</l>
       <l n="3">Is a good enough place for a while ,</l>
       <l n="4">It fawns on the clever and witty ,</l>
       <l n="5">And welcomes the rich with a smile ;</l>
       <l n="6">It lavishes money as water ,</l>
       <l n="7">It boasts of its palace and hall ,</l>
       <l n="8">But the City is only the daughter —</l>
       <l n="9">The Prairie is mother of all !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="10">The City is all artificial ,</l>
       <l n="11">Its life is a fashion-made fraud ,</l>
       <l n="12">Its wisdom , though learned and judicial ,</l>
       <l n="13">Is far from the wisdom of God ;</l>
       <l n="14">Its hope is the hope of ambition ,</l>
       <l n="15">Its lust is the lust to acquire ,</l>
       <l n="16">And the larger it grows , its condition</l>
       <l n="17">Sinks lower in pestilent mire .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="18">The City is cramped and congested ,</l>
       <l n="19">The haunt and the covert of crime ;</l>
       <l n="20">The Prairie is broad , unmolested ,</l>
       <l n="21">It points to the high and sublime ;</l>
       <l n="22">Where only the sky is above you</l>
       <l n="23">And only the distance in view ,</l>
       <l n="24">With no one to jostle or shove you —</l>
       <l n="25">It 's there a man learns to be true !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="26">Where the breeze whispers over the willows</l>
       <l n="27">Or sighs in the dew laden grass ,</l>
       <l n="28">And the rain clouds , like big , stormy billows ,</l>
       <l n="29">Besprinkle the land as they pass ;</l>
       <l n="30">With the smudge-fire alight in the distance ,</l>
       <l n="31">The wild duck alert on the stream ,</l>
       <l n="32">Where life is a psalm of existence</l>
       <l n="33">And opulence only a dream .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="34">Where wide as the plan of creation</l>
       <l n="35">The Prairies stretch ever away ,</l>
       <l n="36">And beckon a broad invitation</l>
       <l n="37">To fly to their bosom , and stay ;</l>
       <l n="38">The prairie fire smell in the gloaming —</l>
       <l n="39">The water-wet wind in the spring —</l>
       <l n="40">An empire untrod for the roaming —</l>
       <l n="41">Ah , this is a life for a king !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="42">When peaceful and pure as a river</l>
       <l n="43">They lie in the light of the moon ,</l>
       <l n="44">You know that the Infinite Giver</l>
       <l n="45">Is stringing your spirit a-tune ;</l>
       <l n="46">That life is not told in the telling ,</l>
       <l n="47">That death does not whisper adieu ,</l>
       <l n="48">And deep in your bosom up-welling ,</l>
       <l n="49">You know that the Promise is true !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="50">To those who have seen it and smelt it ,</l>
       <l n="51">To those who have loved it alone</l>
       <l n="52">To those who have known it and felt it —</l>
       <l n="53">The Prairie is ever their own ;</l>
       <l n="54">And far though they wander , unwary ,</l>
       <l n="55">Far , far from the breath of the plain ,</l>
       <l n="56">A thought of the wind on the Prairie</l>
       <l n="57">Will set their blood rushing again .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="9">
       <l n="58">Then you to the City who want it ,</l>
       <l n="59">Go , grovel its gain-glutted streets ,</l>
       <l n="60">Be one of the ciphers that haunt it ,</l>
       <l n="61">Or sit in its opulent seats ;</l>
       <l n="62">But for me , where the Prairies are reaching</l>
       <l n="63">As far as the vision can scan —</l>
       <l n="64">Ah , that is the prayer and the preaching</l>
       <l n="65">That goes to the heart of a man !</l>

      <head>THE GRAMOPHONE</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">Where the lonely settler 's shanty dots the plain ,</l>
       <l n="2">And he sighs for friends and comradeship in vain ,</l>
       <l n="3">Through the silences intense</l>
       <l n="4">Comes a sound of eloquence</l>
       <l n="5">Shrilling forth in steely , brazen , waxen strain —</l>
       <l n="6">The deep , resonant voice of Gladstone calling from the tomb ,</l>
       <l n="7">Or Ingersoll 's deliverance before his brother 's bier ;</l>
       <l n="8">Then a saucy someone singing , “ When the daisies are in bloom , ”</l>
       <l n="9">And the fife and drummers rendering “ The British Grenadier . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="10">Back as far into the hills as they could get ,</l>
       <l n="11">They 've a roof that turns the winter and the wet ,</l>
       <l n="12">They are grizzled but they 're gay ,</l>
       <l n="13">They 've a daily matinee ,</l>
       <l n="14">They are happy though they 're head and ears in debt —</l>
       <l n="15">“ I wish I had my old girl back again , ”</l>
       <l n="16">“ If the wind had only blown the other way , ”</l>
       <l n="17">Uncertain voices join an old refrain</l>
       <l n="18">And repeat the same performance every day .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="19">There 's a Scotchman holding down a mining claim</l>
       <l n="20">All unknown to Fortune , Influence or Fame ,</l>
       <l n="21">But a few of Harry 's songs</l>
       <l n="22">Are a solace for his wrongs</l>
       <l n="23">And he sings them ev'ry evening in his “ hame ” —</l>
       <l n="24">“ I 'm courtin ’ Bonnie Leezy Lindsay noo , ”</l>
       <l n="25">“ When I get back again ” — you know the lilt —</l>
       <l n="26">“ We parted on the shore , ” “ I 'm fou ’ , I 'm fou ’ , ”</l>
       <l n="27">“ And that 's the reason noo I wear the kilt . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="28">There 's a son of Erin in Saskatchewan ,</l>
       <l n="29">He 's at work a half an hour before the dawn ,</l>
       <l n="30">But before he goes to bunk</l>
       <l n="31">He makes a table of his trunk</l>
       <l n="32">And he sets his clock-work concert thereupon —</l>
       <l n="33">“ The harp that once through Tara 's halls , ”</l>
       <l n="34">“ St Patrick 's day in the mornin ’ , ”</l>
       <l n="35">“ The last rose of summer , ” and Fancy recalls</l>
       <l n="36">A glimpse of his “ Kathleen Mavourneen . ”</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="37">There 's an Englishman who 's living in a shack ,</l>

       <l n="40">( He has half that many “ quids ” )</l>
       <l n="41">But he dances with the youngest on his back —</l>
       <l n="42">Though he 's living in the country of the Cree</l>
       <l n="43">The horn that hangs a fathom from his head</l>
       <l n="44">Stretches out a thousand leagues across the sea</l>
       <l n="45">And sings in dear old London town instead .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="46">They are far from auditorium or hall ,</l>

       <l n="48">They can hear Caruso sing ,</l>
       <l n="49">Or the bells of Shandon ring ,</l>
       <l n="50">As they smoke and count the cracks along the wall .</l>
      </lg>

       <l n="54">And the ends of all creation sit and listen while I sing :</l>
       <l n="55">I 'm the Voice of all that man has sought and gained ;</l>
       <l n="56">I 'm the throb of ev'ry heart that ever pained ;</l>

      <head>THE PLOW</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">What power is this that stands behind the steel ?—</l>
       <l n="2">A homely implement of blade and wheel —</l>
       <l n="3">Neglected by the margin of the way ,</l>
       <l n="4">And flashing back the blaze of dying day ;</l>
       <l n="5">Or dragging slow across the yellow field</l>
       <l n="6">In silent prophecy of lavish yield ,</l>
       <l n="7">It marks the pace of innocence and toil ,</l>
       <l n="8">And taps the boundless treasure of the soil .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="9">Before you came the red man rode the plain .</l>
       <l n="10">Untitled lord of Nature 's great domain ;</l>
       <l n="11">The shaggy herds , knee deep in mellow grass ;</l>
       <l n="12">The lazy summer hours were wont to pass ;</l>
       <l n="13">The wild goose nested by the water side ;</l>
       <l n="14">The red deer roamed upon the prairie wide ;</l>
       <l n="15">The black bear trod the woods in solemn might ;</l>
       <l n="16">The lynx stole through the bushes in the night .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="17">No sound of toil was heard in all the land ;</l>
       <l n="18">No joyous laugh of voice or sharp command ,</l>
       <l n="19">No cloud of smoke from iron funnels thrown</l>
       <l n="20">Was through the autumn hazes gently blown ;</l>
       <l n="21">No edge of steel tore up the virgin sod ;</l>
       <l n="22">No church its shining finger turned to God ;</l>
       <l n="23">No tradesman labored over bench and tool ;</l>
       <l n="24">No children chattered on their way to school .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="25">But all the land lay desolate and bare ,</l>
       <l n="26">Its wealth of plain its forest riches rare</l>
       <l n="27">Unguessed by those who saw it through their tears ,</l>
       <l n="28">And Nature — miser of a thousand years —</l>
       <l n="29">Was adding still to her immense reserve</l>
       <l n="30">That shall supply the world with brawn and nerve :</l>
       <l n="31">But all lay silent , useless , and unused ,</l>
       <l n="32">And useless ‘ twas because it was unused .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="33">You came . Straightway the silent plain</l>
       <l n="34">Grew mellow with the glow of golden grain ;</l>
       <l n="35">The axes in the solitary wood</l>
       <l n="36">Rang out where stately oak and maple stood ;</l>
       <l n="37">The land became alive with busy din ,</l>
       <l n="38">And as the many settled , more came in ;</l>
       <l n="39">The world looked on in wonder and dismay —</l>
       <l n="40">The building of a nation in a day !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="41">By lake and river , rock and barren waste ,</l>
       <l n="42">A peaceful army toiled in eager haste ;</l>
       <l n="43">Ten thousand workers sweating in the sun</l>
       <l n="44">Pressed on the task so recently begun ;</l>
       <l n="45">Their outworks every day were forced ahead —</l>
       <l n="46">And every day they gave their toll of dead —</l>
       <l n="47">Until at length the double lines of steel</l>
       <l n="48">Received the steaming steed and whirling wheel !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="49">Where yesterday the lazy bison lay</l>
       <l n="50">A city glitters in the sun to-day ;</l>
       <l n="51">His paths are turned to streets of wood and stone ,</l>
       <l n="52">And thousands tread the way he trod alone ;</l>
       <l n="53">The mighty hum of industry and trade</l>
       <l n="54">Fills all the place where once he held parade ,</l>
       <l n="55">And far away the unheard river 's play</l>
       <l n="56">Makes joyous night still brighter than the day !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="57">Upon the plains a thousand towns arise ,</l>
       <l n="58">And quickly each to be a city tries ;</l>
       <l n="59">The sound of trade is heard on every hand</l>
       <l n="60">And sturdy men rise to possess the land ;</l>
       <l n="61">Awhile they lingered , thinking it a dream ,</l>
       <l n="62">But now they flow in a resistless stream</l>
       <l n="63">That seems to fill the prairie far and near ,</l>
       <l n="64">Yet in its vastness soon they disappear .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="9">
       <l n="65">Where once the silent red man spurned the ground</l>
       <l n="66">A land of peace and plenty now is found ,</l>
       <l n="67">A land by Nature destined to be great ,</l>
       <l n="68">Where every man is lord of his estate ;</l>
       <l n="69">Where men may dwell together in accord ,</l>
       <l n="70">And honest toil receive its due reward ;</l>
       <l n="71">Where loyal friends and happy homes are made ,</l>
       <l n="72">And culture follows hard the feet of trade .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="10">
       <l n="73">This you have made it . Is it vain to hope</l>
       <l n="74">The sons of such a land will climb and grope</l>
       <l n="75">Along the undiscovered ways of life ,</l>
       <l n="76">And neither seek nor be found shunning strife ,</l>
       <l n="77">But ever , beckoned by a high ideal ,</l>
       <l n="78">Press onward , upward , till they make it real ;</l>
       <l n="79">With feet sure planted on their native sod ,</l>
       <l n="80">And will and aspirations linked with God ?</l>

       <l n="4">Where the Northland fairies ’ feet had flown ,</l>

       <l n="6">At the close of a thousand eons of sleep came a pang that was strange</l>

       <l n="9">The swell of a vast and a vague unrest ,</l>
       <l n="10">And it thrilled my soul from East to West</l>

      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="12">But I steeled my heart to the biped thing ; of vast presumption he :</l>

       <l n="15">Where the dust of the prehistoric lay ;</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="17">So I stretched my plains for a thousand leagues from the mountains</l>

       <l n="46">In the last race-birth of the sons of men a travail holdeth me ;</l>

       <l n="35">I left the answer to my wife . With lips as white as snow ,</l>
       <l n="36">She whispered , “ Do your duty , ” and I said , “ All right , I 'll go . ”</l>

       <l n="37">My fireman knew my trouble , and in rough-and-ready way</l>

       <l n="39">The night was dark and moonless , but the bright stars overhead</l>
       <l n="40">Seemed to whisper to each other , “ His little boy is dead . ”</l>
       <l n="41">The very locomotive seemed to read my thoughts aright ,</l>
       <l n="42">And the monster sobbed in sympathy as we bulleted the night .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="43">We 'd been running fast and steady till a little after two ;</l>
       <l n="44">All the passengers were fast asleep , except , perhaps , a few</l>
       <l n="45">Who sat a-swapping stories in the smoker , when a sight</l>
       <l n="46">Met my eyes that fairly froze my blood in terror and affright —</l>
       <l n="47">For there , before me , standing in the halo of the light</l>
       <l n="48">Was a little child outlined against the blackness of the night !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="9">
       <l n="49">Oh , I could not be mistaken , I would know him anywhere ,</l>
       <l n="50">With his father 's mouth and forehead , and his mother 's eyes and hair ,</l>
       <l n="51">And little arms outstretched to me that seemed to coax and say ,</l>
       <l n="52">“ Come , Daddy , come and kiss me , for I 'm going far away . ”</l>
       <l n="53">I flung the brake and throttle , and amid the hissing steam</l>
       <l n="54">The vision grew , and waned away , and vanished as a dream !</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>My fireman was beside me : “ Your nerve is going , Jack ; Let 's leave the engine here and take a walk along the track . The exercise will do you good . ” I followed as he led , Until we reached the gorge about a hundred yards ahead : The night wind cooled my temples as we walked the bridge upon , Till we sudden stopped with a sudden gasp — — THE CENTRE SPAN WAS GONE !</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">You may call it hallucination , as some of the others do ,</l>
       <l n="2">But I know that the Master took my boy that night at half-past two ;</l>
       <l n="3">And the prayers of a hundred passengers had been offered up in vain</l>
       <l n="4">Had his spirit , clad in his baby dress , not stood before my train . . . .</l>
       <l n="5">I know I cried in my window-seat , and was otherwise ill-behaved</l>
       <l n="6">But the life that I lost was more to me than all the lives he saved .</l>

      <head>GOING HOME</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">The village lights grew dim behind , the snow lay vast and white</l>
       <l n="2">And silent as an icy shroud spread out upon the night ;</l>
       <l n="3">A wan moon struggled with the clouds and through the misty haze</l>
       <l n="4">The trails that branched to left and right were tangled as a maze ;</l>
       <l n="5">The settler 's horses plodded in the soft , uncertain snow ;</l>
       <l n="6">And , stealing cautiously behind , a Thing moved to and fro .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="7">The trail was little travelled , and the pale , sad , sickly light</l>
       <l n="8">Was hindrance , rather than a help , to read the road aright ;</l>
       <l n="9">A dozen miles lay stretched between the settler and his shack :</l>
       <l n="10">He thought of many things that night — not once of turning back .</l>
       <l n="11">Above the crunching of the snow he heard the rising wind ,</l>
       <l n="12">But never looked — and never saw — the Thing that stole behind .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="13">The trail was lost ; the horses took their way across the plain ;</l>
       <l n="14">The settler strove to hold the course , but strove , alas , in vain ;</l>
       <l n="15">The fickle wind seemed scarce to stay a moment at a place —</l>
       <l n="16">Now howling in a real attack , now snapping at his face ;</l>
       <l n="17">And nearing , leering , peering , in the ghastly , ghostly light ,</l>
       <l n="18">The Thing came softly after as it followed in the night .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="19">A light ! a light ! a welcome light gleamed friendly from afar :</l>
       <l n="20">Oh , can it be — it cannot be — ‘ tis surely not a star ?</l>
       <l n="21">Nay , nay , it is more warm and near , a happy farmer 's home</l>
       <l n="22">That beckons to the wanderer , “ You need no longer roam . ”</l>
       <l n="23">With eager hope they hastened on , and plied across the plain ;</l>
       <l n="24">As often as the horses fell they rose to plunge again .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="25">The hours moved on , the miles moved on , they followed as a dream</l>
       <l n="26">The waning light , the dying light , of that deceitful gleam ,</l>
       <l n="27">And when at last it seemed the place must almost be in sight ,</l>
       <l n="28">The light went out ! Oh , perfidy ! Oh , murderous , mocking light !</l>
       <l n="29">‘ Twas well the ears grew deaf before the howling of the wind ,</l>
       <l n="30">Nor heard the ghoulish chuckle of the gloating Thing behind .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="31">The snow lay deep ; the horses floundered with the heavy sleigh ,</l>
       <l n="32">Till , plunging in a sudden drift , they tore the tongue away ;</l>
       <l n="33">The sleepy driver knew it not , as through his nerveless hands</l>
       <l n="34">His hold on life was slipping with the frozen leather bands .</l>
       <l n="35">The night was calm and beautiful , the frost had ceased to smart . . . .</l>
       <l n="36">The Thing had lept upon him and was tearing at his heart !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="37">The room was warm and cosy , and the light was soft and low ,</l>
       <l n="38">Her presence seemed to radiate a tender , girlish glow ,</l>
       <l n="39">And when she placed her hand in his , the soft , caressing palm</l>
       <l n="40">Was cure for every trouble , and for every pain a balm :</l>
       <l n="41">And she whispered , “ Sweet , my sweetheart , I 'll be faithful , I 'll</l>
       <l n="42">be true ;</l>
       <l n="43">In the springtime , in the springtime , I will cross the sea to</l>
       <l n="44">you . ” . . .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="45">A little bed was fashioned in the fitful firelight glow ;</l>
       <l n="46">A little boy was murmuring a prayer of long ago ;</l>
       <l n="47">And mother-hands upon his head , that fondled in his hair ,</l>
       <l n="48">And sense of quiet comfort and respite from every care ;</l>
       <l n="49">And a pillow white and downy , and a bed so soft and deep ,</l>
       <l n="50">And tired lips were lisping , “ Now I lay me down to sleep . ” . . .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="9">
       <l n="51">Again the scene was changed : A flood of mellow , amber light ,</l>
       <l n="52">That filled the soul with ecstasy of infinite delight ;</l>
       <l n="53">While crystal-cadenced music tinkled through the yellow glow ,</l>
       <l n="54">The lullabies of childhood and the songs of long ago ;</l>
       <l n="55">The sea of God on every hand in silent silver lay :</l>
       <l n="56">An atom fell : its circles spread through all eternity .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="10">
       <l n="57">The Thing was gone ; its work was done ; a lump of lifeless clay</l>
       <l n="58">Sat crouching , crouching , crouching in the dawning of the day ;</l>
       <l n="59">The frozen eyeballs stared upon a wilderness of snow ,</l>
       <l n="60">And peered into the future , to the Place no man may know .</l>
       <l n="61">A she-wolf prowled about the spot , and sniffed below the sleigh ,</l>
       <l n="62">And howled a melancholy howl , and slunk in fear away .</l>

       <l n="7">With the prairie for a pillow and the sky above their dreams ,</l>
       <l n="8">They were mapping unborn cities in the age-long pregnant clay :</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="10">There were violets growing on it , and a buttercup or two ,</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="26">And Sergeant Blue sat back and smiled , “ Ho , here is a chance of game !</l>
       <l n="27">Folks ‘ round here have been so good that life is getting tame ;</l>
       <l n="28">I know the lie of Snake Creek Gulch — where I used to set my traps —</l>

       <l n="30">Next morning Sergeant Blue , arrayed in farmer smock and jeans ,</l>
       <l n="31">In a jumper sleigh he had made himself set out for the evergreens</l>
       <l n="32">That grow on the bank of Snake Creek Gulch by a homestead shack he knew ,</l>
       <l n="33">And a smoke curled up from the chimney-pipe to welcome Sergeant Blue .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="34">“ Aha , and that looks good to me , ” said the Sergeant to the smoke ,</l>
       <l n="35">“ For the lad that owns this homestead shack is East in his wedding-yoke ;</l>
       <l n="36">There are strangers here and I 'll bet a farm against a horn of booze</l>
       <l n="37">That they are the bums that are predestined to dangle in a noose . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="9">
       <l n="38">So he drove his horse to the shanty door and hollered a loud “ Good-day , ”</l>
       <l n="39">And a couple of men with fighting-irons came out beside the sleigh ,</l>
       <l n="40">And the Sergeant said , “ I 'm a stranger here and I 've driven a weary mile ;</l>
       <l n="41">If you do n't object I 'll just sit down by the stove in the shack awhile . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="10">
       <l n="42">So the Sergeant sat and smoked and talked of the home he had left down</l>
       <l n="43">East ,</l>
       <l n="44">And the cold , and the snow , and the price of land , and the life of man</l>
       <l n="45">and beast ,</l>
       <l n="46">But all of a sudden he broke it off with , “ Neighbors , take a nip ?</l>
       <l n="47">There 's a horn of the best you 'll find out there in my jumper , in the</l>
       <l n="48">grip . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="11">
       <l n="49">So one of the two went out for it , and as soon as he closed the door</l>
       <l n="50">The other one staggered back as he gazed up the nose of a forty-four ,</l>
       <l n="51">But the Sergeant wasted no words with him , “ Now , fellow , you 're on the</l>
       <l n="52">rocks ,</l>
       <l n="53">And a noise as loud as a mouse from you and they 'll take you out in a</l>
       <l n="54">box . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="12">
       <l n="55">So he fastened the bracelets to his wrists and his legs with some</l>
       <l n="56">binder-thread ,</l>
       <l n="57">And he took his knife and he took his gun and he rolled him onto the</l>
       <l n="58">bed ;</l>
       <l n="59">And then as number two came in he said , “ If you want to live ,</l>
       <l n="60">Put up your dukes and behave yourself or I 'll make you into a sieve . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="13">
       <l n="61">And when he had coupled them each to each , and laid them out on the</l>
       <l n="62">bed ,</l>
       <l n="63">“ It 's cold , and I guess we 'd better eat before we go , ” he said .</l>
       <l n="64">So he fried some pork and he warmed some beans , and he set out the</l>
       <l n="65">best he saw ,</l>
       <l n="66">And they ate thereof , and he paid for it , according to British law .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="14">
       <l n="67">That night in the post sat Sergeant Blue with paper and pen in hand ,</l>
       <l n="68">And this is the word he wrote and signed and mailed to a foreign land :</l>
       <l n="69">“ To U. S. Marshall of County Blank , greetings I give to you ;</l>

       <l n="1">When Lord Landseeker came out West to have a look around ,</l>

       <l n="3">He had n't breathed the prairie air more than a day or two</l>
       <l n="4">Until he was the centre of a philanthropic crew</l>
       <l n="5">Who sought to show His Lordship all the shortcuts to success</l>
       <l n="6">( Though why they should have troubled , His Lordship could n't guess ,</l>
       <l n="7">For each was losing money , as he candidly confessed ,</l>

      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="9">Thus His Lordship grew suspicious that his “ friends ” would turn him</l>

       <l n="11">And he quietly bought a ticket to a little country town ;</l>
       <l n="12">But he did n't know the message that was flashed along the wire</l>
       <l n="13">To a simple country dealer in the land of his desire ;</l>
       <l n="14">And it read : “ Look out for Goggles , he 'll be with you this a. m . ”</l>
       <l n="15">And the crowd around the station — well , he merely smiled to them ,</l>
       <l n="16">And thought it jolly decent they 'd assemble , don'tcherknow ,</l>
       <l n="17">And file along behind him as they followed , in a row .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="18">The snow had fallen softly all the calm November night ,</l>

       <l n="20">But His Lordship took a citizen who “ happened ” in his way ,</l>
       <l n="21">And they drove into the country for the most part of the day ,</l>
       <l n="22">Until they reached a section that was flat and free from stone ,</l>
       <l n="23">And the citizen remarked about a fellow he had known</l>
       <l n="24">Who offered thirty dollars for this section in the fall ,</l>
       <l n="25">But the owner wanted forty , or he would n't sell at all .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="26">Then His Lordship drove across it , and it seemed to catch his eye ,</l>
       <l n="27">And he whispered to the driver , “ That 's the section I will buy ; ”</l>
       <l n="28">So in town they found the owner , who was very loath to sell ,</l>
       <l n="29">But he finally consented , if His Lordship would n't tell</l>
       <l n="30">That the price was forty dollars by the acre ; this agreed ,</l>
       <l n="31">A lawyer drew the papers and His Lordship got the deed ,</l>
       <l n="32">And he sailed across the ocean with the satisfying thought</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="34">The winter snows had vanished and the spring was growing late ,</l>

       <l n="36">And he drove out in a buggy to where his section lay ,</l>
       <l n="37">And his heart was very happy as he smoked along the way</l>
       <l n="38">Till the section burst upon them , and he scarce believed his sight ,</l>
       <l n="39">For the land lay in the sunshine , flashing back a snowy white . . . . .</l>
       <l n="40">And His Lordship stooped and felt it , and he heaved a little sigh ,</l>
       <l n="41">As the knowledge dawned upon him that his land was — alkali !</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="51">In the papers of Old England there appeared a little ad ,</l>

       <l n="59">His Lordship 's college prospers and is crowded to the doors</l>
       <l n="60">With “ students ” playing poker while the “ servants ” do the chores ;</l>
       <l n="61">What they do not know of farming they make up in other lines</l>
       <l n="62">They are judges of tobacco and connoisseurs of wines ;</l>
       <l n="63">They are experts at the races and at sundry other games —</l>

       <l n="65">Though they 're far from home and kindred they occasion no alarm ,</l>

       <l n="6">And the frost-line crawling , crawling , like a snake , along the floor ;</l>
       <l n="7">We have felt the storm-fiend wrestle with the rafters in his might ,</l>

       <l n="13">We have known the resurrection of the Springtime in the land ,</l>

      <head>THE OLD GUARD</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">Knew you the men of the Old Guard ? Men of the camp and trail ;</l>
       <l n="2">Guard of the van when Time began in the land of grass and gale ,</l>
       <l n="3">Of a sky-wide land they seized command where the mightiest prevail .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="4">Who were the men of the Old Guard ? Giants of strength and will ,</l>
       <l n="5">Trained in the school of hard-luck rule and daring to die or kill ;</l>
       <l n="6">Staking their lives , and their young , and wives , on the road up</l>
       <l n="7">Fortune 's hill .</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>Whence were the men of the Old Guard ? Heroes of ‘ 82 ; From swamp and ledge and ocean 's edge they came to see and do , And they failed at first , and the land they cursed , but they stayed and struggled through .</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">Hope of the men of the Old Guard ? Little but hope was theirs ;</l>
       <l n="2">With empty hand in an untried land they clutched at wheat and tares ,</l>
       <l n="3">And home at night by the wood-fire light was answer to their prayers .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>Way of the men of the Old Guard ? What of their end and way ? You may find their bones by the lime-white stones where the sun-dried sleugh-holes lay , For the Goddess Trade is a costly jade , and they were the ones to pay .</p>
     <p>Joy of the men of the Old Guard ? The joy of the brave and true ; With joy they paced where Death grimaced and his icy vapors blew , And with steady tread they bore their dead with the faith of the chosen few .</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">What of the men of the Old Guard ? Ask of the arching skies ,</l>
       <l n="2">The grass that waves on their leafy graves is lisping their lullabies ,</l>
       <l n="3">And the lives they spent are their monument and their title to Paradise .</l>

       <l n="2">Where the farthest foothills flatten to a circle-sweeping plain ,</l>
       <l n="3">And the cattle lands surrender to the onward march of grain ,</l>
       <l n="4">Where the prairies stretch unbroken to the corners of the sky ,</l>
       <l n="5">And the foremost wheat fields rustle in the warm winds droning by —</l>
       <l n="6">There a crippled cowboy batches in the haunts of old-time herds ,</l>
       <l n="7">And the balance of the story is repeated in his words :</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="8">So you never heard how I lost my leg and hobble now on a crutch ?</l>
       <l n="9">So far as the story relates to me it can n't concern you much ,</l>
       <l n="10">For it 's really the story of Kid McCann and the price that a girl will</l>
       <l n="11">pay</l>
       <l n="12">For the fellow she sets her fancy on , as only a woman may ;</l>
       <l n="13">It is n't every girl who proves her faithfulness in flames ,</l>
       <l n="14">But fellows who listen with moistened eyes speak softly of other names .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="15">Ned McCann owned the Double Star ‘ way back in the early days ;</l>
       <l n="16">He had come out here with a sickly wife and a kid he hoped to raise</l>
       <l n="17">Where the climate suited the feeble-lunged , but life was scarce at its</l>
       <l n="18">brim ,</l>
       <l n="19">Till a little mound by a prairie hill held half of the world for him ;</l>
       <l n="20">And his double love would have spoiled the child had she been like me</l>
       <l n="21">or you ,</l>
       <l n="22">But her only thought was for her dad and the mother she scarcely knew .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="23">‘ Course , she was bred to the ranges , and before she had reached her</l>
       <l n="24">teens</l>
       <l n="25">She could straddle a nag with the best of us and ride in her smock and</l>
       <l n="26">jeans</l>
       <l n="27">Till we all caved in , and she thought it fun to camp with the round-up</l>
       <l n="28">bunch ,</l>
       <l n="29">And she shared her pillow and shared our sky and shared our pipe and</l>
       <l n="30">lunch ,</l>
       <l n="31">And all of us mad in love with her , but she was only a kid ,</l>
       <l n="32">And she never dreamt what our feelings were , or the love-struck things</l>
       <l n="33">we did .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="34">But even girls grow older , and , though always kind and sweet ,</l>
       <l n="35">There came a day when she realized that we were at her feet ,</l>
       <l n="36">But I had never spoken , nor anyone in the camp ,</l>
       <l n="37">When in came a foreign puncher , a thoroughbred black-leg scamp ,</l>
       <l n="38">And we who had known her since childhood saw , in our unbelieving eyes ,</l>
       <l n="39">This wily sinner setting himself to carry off the prize .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="40">Of course it could n't be stood for , and little as I might like ,</l>
       <l n="41">It fell to my lot to intimate to him it was time to hike ,</l>
       <l n="42">Which I did in straightforward manner , in a way to be understood ,</l>
       <l n="43">And he looked at me with a sulky scowl that boded none of us good ;</l>
       <l n="44">But he did as he was ordered , to be absent before night ,</l>
       <l n="45">And we lost his form in the shadowy East as he cantered out of sight .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="46">Next day , as I rode on my cayuse , apart from the rest of the gang ,</l>
       <l n="47">I felt a sudden rip in my leg like the jab of a red-hot tang ;</l>
       <l n="48">And my horse went down below me , with my leg crushed in the clay ,</l>
       <l n="49">And over me leered that fiendish face , and he grinned , and rode away ;</l>
       <l n="50">Rode away to the eastward ,— I saw him fade in the sky ,</l>
       <l n="51">And crushed and pinned from hip to heel I counted the hours to die .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="9">
       <l n="52">How long I lay I could never tell , for the hours were days to me ,</l>
       <l n="53">Till struck with sudden terror I tore at my wounded knee ,</l>
       <l n="54">For the east wind carried a smoky smell , and I read in its fiery breath</l>
       <l n="55">That half-a-mile of sun-dried grass was all between me and death ;</l>
       <l n="56">With my hunting-knife I hacked my leg , but I could n't cut the bone ,</l>
       <l n="57">So I set myself as best I could to face my fate alone .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="10">
       <l n="58">The fire came on like a hungry fiend on the wings of the rising wind ,</l>
       <l n="59">And I would n't care to tell you all the things that were in my mind ;</l>
       <l n="60">I saw the sun through the swirling smoke and the blue sky far above ,</l>
       <l n="61">And I bade good-bye to the things of earth and the dearer hopes of</l>
       <l n="62">love ;</l>
       <l n="63">And I figured that I had closed accounts for life 's uncertain span ,</l>
       <l n="64">When a smoke-blind broncho galloped up and there sat Kid McCann !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="11">
       <l n="65">There was n't much time for talking , with the death-roll in our ears ,</l>
       <l n="66">But we sometimes live in seconds more than we could in a thousand of</l>
       <l n="67">years ,</l>
       <l n="68">And before I could guess her meaning she had thrown herself on my face ,</l>
       <l n="69">And spread her leather jacket , which her warm hands held in place ;</l>
       <l n="70">I felt her breath in my nostrils and her fingertips in my hair ,</l>
       <l n="71">And through the roar of the burning grass I fancied I heard a prayer .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="12">
       <l n="72">‘ Twas but for a moment ; the flames were gone ; unharmed they had passed</l>
       <l n="73">me by ;</l>
       <l n="74">God knows why the useless are spared to live while the faithful are</l>
       <l n="75">called to die ,</l>
       <l n="76">But the form that had sheltered me shivered , and seemed to shrivel</l>
       <l n="77">away ,</l>
       <l n="78">And when I had raised it clear of my face I looked into lifeless</l>
       <l n="79">clay . . . .</l>
       <l n="80">And darkness fell , and the world was black , and the last of my reason</l>
       <l n="81">fled ,</l>
       <l n="82">And when I came to myself again I was back at the ranch , in bed .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="13">
       <l n="83">That was back in the Eighties , and still I am living here ;</l>
       <l n="84">I built this shanty on the spot ; her grave is lying near ;</l>
       <l n="85">And when at nights my nostrils sense the smoke-smell in the air</l>
       <l n="86">I seem to feel her form again , and hear again her prayer ;</l>
       <l n="87">And then the darkness settles down and wild night-creatures cry ,</l>
       <l n="88">But stars come out in heaven and there 's comfort in the sky .</l>

       <l n="2">Yes , stranger , I hev trailed the West</l>
       <l n="3">Since I wuz a kid on a bob-tailed nag ,</l>
       <l n="4">I hev known the old land at its best ,</l>
       <l n="5">An ’ packed most ev'ry kind of jag ;</l>
       <l n="6">I hev rode fer life frum a prairie fire ,</l>
       <l n="7">An ’ tramped fer life through a snow blockade ;</l>
       <l n="8">I hev crumpled “ bad men ” by the quire ,</l>
       <l n="9">But only once hev I been afraid .</l>

       <l n="12">I have soothed the widow while she wep ’</l>
       <l n="13">Because I 'd made her man a saint ;</l>
       <l n="14">I hev lassooed lobsters frum the East ,</l>
       <l n="15">Till ev'ry j'int in their system shook ,</l>
       <l n="16">An ’ I 'd never run frum man or beast</l>
       <l n="17">Until I run frum a chinook .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="18">The chinook had his lair in Crow 's Nest Pass ,</l>
       <l n="19">An ’ he foraged aroun ’ the Porcupine Hills ,</l>
       <l n="20">But he 'd loafed so long that the ranchin ’ grass</l>
       <l n="21">Had a wool-white cover frum the chills ;</l>
       <l n="22">An ’ me , like a chap that wuz not afraid</l>
       <l n="23">Of anything with hide an ’ hair ,</l>
       <l n="24">Went out in a sleigh to the hills an ’ stayed</l>
       <l n="25">Till the old chinook might find me there .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="26">At last , when I thought I had tempted fate</l>
       <l n="27">Enough fer a man with a past like mine ,</l>
       <l n="28">I hitched the bronks an ’ struck a gait</l>
       <l n="29">Along the slopes of the Porcupine ;</l>
       <l n="30">An ’ the day wuz as cold as the Polar Sea ,</l>
       <l n="31">With a nip as keen as a she-wolf fang ;</l>
       <l n="32">But frost wuz just like food to me ,</l>
       <l n="33">An ’ boldly over the fields I sang :</l>

       <l n="39">They can run a bluff on the prairie-bred ,</l>
       <l n="40">Fer I give their vitals a fatal kink</l>

       <l n="47">An ’ I laughed though the frost cut like a knife ;</l>
       <l n="48">Till sudden I felt the hind bob drag ,</l>

       <l n="50">Out from his lair the sly chinook</l>

       <l n="55">An ’ the sweat stood out on my shoulder-blade ,</l>
       <l n="56">So I yelled at the team through the frozen crack</l>
       <l n="57">The roll of the tongue in my mouth had made —</l>

       <l n="61">An ’ fer once I prayed — fer a pair o ’ wheels ;</l>
       <l n="62">But the sleigh stood still as the hind bob stuck</l>
       <l n="63">In mud that rolled to the bolster-rail ;</l>
       <l n="64">So I slipped the tongue an ’ cursed my luck</l>
       <l n="65">As I straddled a bronk an ’ hit the trail .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="10">
       <l n="66">Well , we beat it out by half a neck ,</l>

       <l n="69">An ’ nearly dead o ’ heat an ’ fright ;</l>
       <l n="70">An ’ I squatted down in a shady spot</l>
       <l n="71">An ’ fanned myself with a wisp o ’ hay ,</l>
       <l n="72">An ’ the boys on the lower ranches thought</l>
