      <docTitle><titlePart>BRIEF HISTORY OF THE FAMOUS SANTA FE TRAIL The early history of the Santa Fe Trail , which runs parallel with the Santa Fe Railroad for hundreds of miles , is somewhat obscured by mystery and tradition , but from historical data in possession of the Museum of New Mexico , at Santa Fe , it can be stated with a large degree of accuracy that the trail was started by Spanish explorers three hundred years ago .</titlePart></docTitle>
      <docImprint>The first known expedition by Americans over the trail was made by the Mallet brothers , who arrived in Santa Fe , July 22 ,<date>1739</date>. The first trader to follow the trail reached Santa Fe in<date>1763</date>. It was not until<date>1804</date>that LaLande , a trapper and hunter , crossed the trail and made Santa Fe that year . Kit Carson was one of those who struck the trail in<date>1826</date>, when he was but sixteen years of age . The camping stations along the trail at that time were Diamond Spring , Lost Spring , Cottonwood Creek , Turkey Creek , Cow Creek ( now Hutchinson , Kansas ) , and further on was Pawnee Rock , a famous landmark of sandstone , twenty feet high . From the year<date>1820</date>many caravans made their way over the trail to Santa Fe , then , as it is to-day , the seat of government . It was here in the old palace that some of the early governors had lived in a semi-royal state , maintaining a little court and body-guards whose lives were by no means a sinecure , since they were called upon to fight the Indians on many occasions . These Indians developed great hostility to the white man , and caravans on the trail were so frequently attacked , and so many tragedies stained the trail with the blood of women and children , that in<date>1823</date>, Colonel Viscarra , Jefe Politicio , of New Mexico , commanded a battalion of Mexican troops in protecting the caravans on the Santa Fe trail . His hand-full of men , and the predatory and blood-thirsty character of the Indians , made it impossible for him to protect any large part of the trail , and soldiers , traders and their families were massacred by overwhelming numbers , the victims including many women and children . The members of one caravan met their fate in sight of Santa Fe , forty-six days out from St. Louis . Colonel Viscarra had not only to deal with one tribe , but many . There were the Navajos , Pawnees , Arapahos , Kiowas , Comanche , Apache and Cheyenee . There was only one tribe friendly to the traders , and that was the Pueblo Indians . In August ,<date>1829</date>, a particularly vicious attack on a caravan on the Santa Fe trail , bound for Santa Fe , caused the traders to petition the government for military protection , and as a result this year , under agreement with the Government of the<country>United States</country>and the Republic of Mexico , four companies of<country>United States</country>troops guarded the great caravans moving from Western Missouri to Santa Fe , as far as the Arkansas River . In spite of this protection , however , attacks by Indians were a common occurrence , and every caravan had to carry arms and ammunition , and vigilance was never relaxed from the time they left the Arkansas River until they struck the plaza at Santa Fe . Colonel Viscarra , a handsome , picturesque Spaniard , always mounted on a mettlesome thoroughbred , was probably the most dashing figure in the history of the Santa Fe trail . Tales of his gallantry and daring became folklore among the traders , pioneers and their descendants . In<date>1843</date>, the American traders commenced to establish regular communication between Missouri and Santa Fe and in<date>1849</date>, started to run a stage from Independence , Mo ., to Santa Fe . The fare was $ 250 . Each passenger was allowed forty pounds of baggage . The capacity of the coach was ten passengers in addition to the driver and messenger . Relays of horses were stationed along the trail every fifteen to twenty miles . The vehicles used by the traders and pioneers were for the greater part Conestoga wagons drawn by horses or mules . As they proceeded westward it was a common sight to see on the trail , “ creoles , polished gentlemen magnificently clothed in Spanish costume , exiled Spaniards escaping from Mexico , and richly caparisoned horses , mules and asses , and a courtesy of the road grew out of a common danger ” . The most terrible part of the trail was the great plain between the Arkansas River and Cimarron Spring . It was over three thousand feet above sea level and sixty-three miles without a water course or pool . The soil was dry and hard and short buffalo grass and some cacti were the only evidence of the parched vegetation . There was not a shrub or tree of any kind . It was a sandy desert plain and it was here the traveler saw the mirage , a beautiful lake which disappeared as he approached it . Breakdowns on this plain were frequent , and the Indians most dangerous . Dry , hot weather prevailed with the blue sky overhead , and over these parched wastes of the desert , exposed to attacks by Indians both night and day , the caravans finally reached Cimarron Spring , which was in a small ravine . After leaving Cimarron Spring ( 445 miles from Independence , Missouri ) , the caravans struck the following camps : Willow Bar ; Cold Spring ; Rabbit Ear Creek ; Round Mound ; Rock Creek ; Point of Rocks ; Rio Colorado ; Ocate Creek ; Santa Clara Spring ( Wagon Mound ) ; Rio Mora ; Rio Gallinas ( Las Vegas ) ; Ojo De Bernal Spring ; San Miguel ; Pecos Village ; and finally Santa Fe , a distance of 750 miles from Independence , Missouri , the starting point . The old Santa Fe Trail led from Franklin , Missouri , through Kansas , Colorado , Oklahoma and New Mexico . It followed the Arkansas River to Cimarron Crossing ( Fort Dodge ) to La Junta , Colorado ; then south , crossing the Raton Pass , joining the main trail at Santa Clara Spring . The passenger looking out of the window of the train on the Santa Fe Railroad will see this trail running for miles parallel with the track , and will be able to people it with the historic traditions which have made the Santa Fe Trail one of the most romantic and , withal , one of the most tragic national highways in the<country>United States</country>.

      <head>BLIND BEGGAR OF ALBUQUERQUE</head>
       <l n="1">There are faces that pass in a moment ,</l>
       <l n="2">But his face will live till I die .</l>
       <l n="3">He 'd a beard and blue eyes like the Saviour ,</l>
       <l n="4">At least like the face we all know ,</l>
       <l n="5">And we met in the cool of the morning ,</l>
       <l n="6">We met about two years ago .</l>
       <l n="7">And my heart bade me call out “ Good morning , ”</l>
       <l n="8">“ Good morning , ” he answered to me .</l>
       <l n="9">But I saw his blue eyes looking elsewhere ,</l>
       <l n="10">Like one who was trying to see .</l>
       <l n="11">He had come from a hut without windows ,</l>
       <l n="12">A mud hut with only a door ,</l>
       <l n="13">Yet his face was the face of the Saviour ,</l>
       <l n="14">And I fain would speak to him more .</l>
       <l n="15">So I stopped , for his smile had a sweetness</l>
       <l n="16">That entered the gates of my soul ;</l>
       <l n="17">I was hungry to know where it came from ,</l>
       <l n="18">That I might its wonders extol .</l>
       <l n="19">And we talked of the beautiful morning ,</l>
       <l n="20">The scent of the grass and the flowers ,</l>
       <l n="21">And he spoke like a man of refinement ,</l>
       <l n="22">Like one to whom knowledge was power ,</l>
       <l n="23">Of the glory of God and His wonders ,</l>
       <l n="24">And we talked for more than an hour .</l>
       <l n="25">I forgot that the speaker was sightless ,</l>
       <l n="26">Or a mud hut his dwelling here .</l>
       <l n="27">Could it be he was just a blind beggar ?</l>
       <l n="28">Was a greater One standing near ?</l>
       <l n="29">And he talked of the hills in their grandeur ,</l>
       <l n="30">As sentinels watching mankind ,</l>
       <l n="31">Of the plains and vales , of sunshine and flowers ,</l>
       <l n="32">Which he only saw in his mind .</l>
       <l n="33">And he spoke of the poor and the lowly ,</l>
       <l n="34">Of God 's mercy to such as he ,</l>
       <l n="35">Of his gratitude to his Creator ,</l>
       <l n="36">Gratitude , though he could not see .</l>
       <l n="37">And I stretched out my arms to that beggar ,</l>
       <l n="38">From Syria , over the sea ,</l>
       <l n="39">With the beard and the eyes of our Saviour —</l>
       <l n="40">At least they looked like that to me .</l>
       <l n="41">He had taught me a wonderful lesson ,</l>
       <l n="42">The burden a Christian could bear ,</l>
       <l n="43">Who from out the dark caverns of blindness</l>

       <l n="14">Alone in his chamber he watched the sun slope down to his Western</l>

       <l n="16">And a gentle smile stole o'er his face , as the old clock chimed the</l>

       <l n="18">His thoughts were of the days gone by — as the host of the Jolly</l>

       <l n="30">a shoe .</l>
       <l n="31">And portly old Judge Horner , who in the room below ,</l>
       <l n="32">Had smoked and drank full many a night in the days of long ago .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="33">And as he thought , the window ope 'd , and in slipped Huntsman Death ,</l>

       <l n="35">breath .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="9">
       <l n="43">His kinsman , riding up the road , with doctors from afar ,</l>

       <l n="45">While the jolly host with Death alone sat in the room above ,</l>
       <l n="46">And drank the foaming liquor down , his first and only love .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="10">
       <l n="47">Just then the sound of horses ’ hoofs the sick man heard without ,</l>
       <l n="48">And he and Death , in one glad breath , sent up a hunting shout —</l>
       <l n="49">“ It 's bold Squire Thornleigh 's raw-boned gray , or Parson Jones 's</l>
       <l n="50">bay —</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="11">
       <l n="52">Yoick 's tally-ho fills loud the room as he springs up from bed ,</l>
       <l n="53">And the bugle horn sounds merrily in the chamber of the dead ;</l>
       <l n="54">Gay prancing steeds and huntsmen bold ride blithely by his side ,</l>
       <l n="55">“ Yoicks ! tally-ho ! ” rang from his lips , and back he fell and died .</l>

       <l n="56">His kinsmen heard that hunting shout , that old familiar cry ,</l>

       <l n="58">Two empty tankards on the floor was all that they could see ,</l>

      <head>DREAMS .</head>
       <l n="1">Midst pastoral lands and purling recluse streams</l>
       <l n="2">There dwells the maiden queen of recreant dreams ,</l>
       <l n="3">Gentian by name , a maid most wondrous fair ,</l>
       <l n="4">With eyes like astral and her glorious hair ,</l>
       <l n="5">Tangled with moonbeams , disputes the right</l>
       <l n="6">Of other garb to veil the beauteous sight .</l>
       <l n="7">Her skin , as white as Ida 's Cretean snow ,</l>
       <l n="8">Outlines a form of soft voluptuous flow</l>
       <l n="9">Of grace majestic , contours fair to see ,</l>
       <l n="10">Exquisite in their matchless symmetry ;</l>
       <l n="11">While , crowning all , a sweet and noble grace</l>
       <l n="12">Marks every movement and o'erspreads her face .</l>
       <l n="13">And having this described this noctal flower ,</l>

       <l n="15">From out her bower of amaranthine hue</l>
       <l n="16">She peers with eyes of soft , exquisite blue ,</l>
       <l n="17">And breathing gently , like a zephyr 's kiss ,</l>
       <l n="18">Enjoys alone the core of perfect bliss .</l>
       <l n="19">Queen of a land , to every mortal given</l>
       <l n="20">A glimpse , at least , of what perchance is heaven ;</l>
       <l n="21">Queen of a land of terror , shame and crime ,</l>
       <l n="22">From life to death , and all that marketh time .</l>
       <l n="23">Queen of a land more wondrous than our own</l>

       <l n="25">Mistress of nations , every soul on earth</l>
       <l n="26">Becomes her vassal at the hour of birth .</l>
       <l n="27">Kings are her subjects , as the peasant boy ,</l>
       <l n="28">And brilliant minds with her a fancy toy .</l>

       <l n="36">Capricious as the sex of womankind .</l>
       <l n="37">Now steeped in bliss she leads the love-sick swain</l>
       <l n="38">And gives the kiss for which he sighed in vain .</l>
       <l n="39">The maid who but that morn his glances fled</l>

       <l n="42">Hears in his sleep his own illustrious name ,</l>

       <l n="44">Into a past of mean obscurity .</l>
       <l n="45">The ship-wrecked boy on some far distant shore</l>
       <l n="46">In happy dreamland sees his home once more ,</l>
       <l n="47">His mother 's face aglow with pride and joy</l>
       <l n="48">As to her breast she clasps her sailor boy ,</l>
       <l n="49">And summer seas beat on the golden sand</l>
       <l n="50">That forms the shore of Gentian 's wonderland .</l>
       <l n="51">The ruined merchant 's heart again grows light ,</l>
       <l n="52">As fortune smiles on him at dead of night ,</l>
       <l n="53">And sheriff 's sales and judgment notes confessed</l>
       <l n="54">No longer break the weary toiler 's rest .</l>
       <l n="55">Proudly he says , “ My word is now my bond , ”</l>
       <l n="56">And coins the yellow dross with Gentian 's wand .</l>
       <l n="57">The holy man , by church ordained a priest ,</l>
       <l n="58">In dreams partaketh of the merry feast ,</l>
       <l n="59">And sparkling glances when the hour is late</l>
       <l n="60">Make roguish havoc with the celibate .</l>
       <l n="61">“ Avaunt ! ” he cries , “ such joys are not for me . ”</l>
       <l n="62">And wakes in prayer upon his bended knee .</l>
       <l n="63">The scientist retires with addled brain</l>
       <l n="64">To dream his fretful genius o'er again ,</l>
       <l n="65">When from Cimmerian darkness breaks a light</l>
       <l n="66">The Atlantic bridged bursts on his ‘ stonished sight .</l>
       <l n="67">And then his mind is turned to stranger things ,</l>
       <l n="68">As up he soars on his invented wings .</l>
       <l n="69">Begrimed with coal , the miner goes to rest</l>
       <l n="70">And sharp-drawn breaths inflate his manly chest .</l>
       <l n="71">Sudden , the clothes are rudely thrust aside ,</l>
       <l n="72">His eyes with terror now stand open wide ;</l>
       <l n="73">The roof is falling , God ! the whole mine shakes !</l>
       <l n="74">A loud explosion , ‘ tis a dream , he wakes .</l>
       <l n="75">A little elf , a girl , a tiny tot ,</l>
       <l n="76">With waxen face , indents the baby cot ,</l>
       <l n="77">And visions fair regale her infant sight</l>
       <l n="78">Of cakes and candy through the silent night .</l>
       <l n="79">Sleep , little angel , Gentian marks thy worth ,</l>
       <l n="80">A sleeping child , the sweetest thing on earth .</l>
       <l n="81">‘ Midst dirt and filth , at night the city gloom</l>
       <l n="82">Steals weird and sickly to a garret room ,</l>
       <l n="83">Where , breathing hard upon a mattress bare ,</l>
       <l n="84">A girlish form is outlined sleeping there .</l>
       <l n="85">One of the lost , polluted , base , defiled ,</l>
       <l n="86">Yet once she slept , a little angel child .</l>
       <l n="87">And now she moves , sweet Gentian enters in ,</l>
       <l n="88">And she is pure again and free from sin .</l>
       <l n="89">The dry , parched lips with innocence now speak ,</l>
       <l n="90">And balmy breezes fan the fevered cheek .</l>
       <l n="91">The little white-washed cottage standeth near</l>
       <l n="92">And mother 's voice sounds sweetly on her ear ,</l>
       <l n="93">While from the fields the scent of new mown hay</l>
       <l n="94">Comes strong and lusty at the close of day .</l>
       <l n="95">Her little sisters and her brothers wait</l>
       <l n="96">For her to join them at the garden gate ,</l>
       <l n="97">And in her sleep her laugh is undefiled ,</l>
       <l n="98">For she is once again a little child .</l>
       <l n="99">The anxious farmer sees his fallow land</l>
       <l n="100">Yield heavy crops beneath the reaper 's hand ,</l>
       <l n="101">And barren orchards bend beneath the weight</l>
       <l n="102">Of golden fruit , ‘ twas joy to cultivate .</l>
       <l n="103">No landlord 's agent doth his peace invade .</l>
       <l n="104">He dreams of ownership , and taxes paid .</l>
       <l n="105">The country parson turns and twists in bed ,</l>
       <l n="106">As mighty thoughts run rampant through his head .</l>
       <l n="107">He mounts the village pulpit wreathed in smiles ,</l>
       <l n="108">And proudly gazes down the crowded aisles .</l>
       <l n="109">Forgot is life , with its unvarnished views</l>
       <l n="110">And vault-like echoes from the empty pews ,</l>
       <l n="111">The church is filled , his lips now move in prayer ,</l>
       <l n="112">And touched is every heart that 's gathered there .</l>
       <l n="113">Not satisfied , his sermon follows next ,</l>
       <l n="114">And from a flower he takes his simple text .</l>
       <l n="115">Now thrills his audience with his eloquence ,</l>
       <l n="116">And marvels greatly at his common sense ;</l>
       <l n="117">And as he speaks with love of our dear Lord ,</l>
       <l n="118">He sees ahead his well-earned , just reward .</l>
       <l n="119">A scholar , preacher , helper of the sick ,</l>
       <l n="120">He gets at last a lawn-sleeved bishopric ,</l>
       <l n="121">But soon as he the pastoral crosier takes ,</l>
       <l n="122">The country parson to himself awakes .</l>
       <l n="123">The hapless monarch on his bed of down</l>
       <l n="124">No longer sinks beneath the jeweled crown ;</l>
       <l n="125">His mind expands with liberty of thought ,</l>
       <l n="126">And heart proclaims his king-ship dearly bought .</l>
       <l n="127">In sleep alone , his deep-drawn sighs confess</l>
       <l n="128">His heart 's desire , domestic happiness .</l>
       <l n="129">“ Domestic happiness , ” sweet Gentian sings ,</l>
       <l n="130">“ Belongs to laborers , and not to kings . ”</l>

       <l n="133">Which pleases best the tricky fairy 's mind ,</l>
