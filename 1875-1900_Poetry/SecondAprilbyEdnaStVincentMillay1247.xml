       <l n="3">Beauty is not enough .</l>
       <l n="4">You can no longer quiet me with the redness</l>
       <l n="5">Of little leaves opening stickily .</l>
       <l n="6">I know what I know .</l>
       <l n="7">The sun is hot on my neck as I observe</l>
       <l n="8">The spikes of the crocus .</l>
       <l n="9">The smell of the earth is good .</l>
       <l n="10">It is apparent that there is no death .</l>
       <l n="11">But what does that signify ?</l>
       <l n="12">Not only under ground are the brains of men</l>
       <l n="13">Eaten by maggots ,</l>
       <l n="14">Life in itself</l>
       <l n="15">Is nothing ,</l>
       <l n="16">An empty cup , a flight of uncarpeted stairs .</l>
       <l n="17">It is not enough that yearly , down this hill ,</l>
       <l n="18">April</l>
       <l n="19">Comes like an idiot , babbling and strewing flowers .</l>

       <l n="21">And , ah , blackened by strange blight ,</l>
       <l n="22">Or to a false sun unfurled ,</l>
       <l n="23">Now forevermore goodbye ,</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="25">On the windless hills of Heaven ,</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="15">
       <l n="57">It was God who walked ahead ,</l>
       <l n="58">Like a shepherd to the fold ;</l>
       <l n="59">In his footsteps fared the weak ,</l>

       <l n="61">Glad enough of gladness over ,</l>

       <l n="65">And I drew a bit apart ,</l>

       <l n="67">And I thought on Peace Eternal ,</l>
       <l n="68">Lest He look into my mind :</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="18">
       <l n="69">And I gazed upon the sky ,</l>
       <l n="70">And I thought of Heavenly Rest ,—</l>
       <l n="71">And I slipped away like water</l>
       <l n="72">Through the fingers of the blest !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="19">
       <l n="73">All their eyes were fixed on Glory ,</l>
       <l n="74">Not a glance brushed over me ;</l>
       <l n="75">“ Alleluia ! Alleluia ! ”</l>
       <l n="76">Up the road ,— and I was free .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="20">
       <l n="77">And my heart rose like a freshet ,</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="21">
       <l n="81">All the earth was charred and black ,</l>
       <l n="82">Fire had swept from pole to pole ;</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="22">
       <l n="85">And the timbered mountain-top</l>

       <l n="88">Of the Earth so beautiful !</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="23">
       <l n="89">“ Earth , ” I said , “ how can I leave you ? ”</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">And I listened for a voice ;—</l>

       <l n="9">And I peered into the smoke</l>

      <head>JOURNEY</head>
       <l n="1">Ah , could I lay me down in this long grass</l>
       <l n="2">And close my eyes , and let the quiet wind</l>
       <l n="3">Blow over me — I am so tired , so tired</l>
       <l n="4">Of passing pleasant places ! All my life ,</l>
       <l n="5">Following Care along the dusty road ,</l>
       <l n="6">Have I looked back at loveliness and sighed ;</l>
       <l n="7">Yet at my hand an unrelenting hand</l>
       <l n="8">Tugged ever , and I passed . All my life long</l>
       <l n="9">Over my shoulder have I looked at peace ;</l>
       <l n="10">And now I fain would lie in this long grass</l>
       <l n="11">And close my eyes .</l>
       <l n="12">Yet onward !</l>
       <l n="13">Cat birds call</l>
       <l n="14">Through the long afternoon , and creeks at dusk</l>
       <l n="15">Are guttural . Whip-poor-wills wake and cry ,</l>
       <l n="16">Drawing the twilight close about their throats .</l>
       <l n="17">Only my heart makes answer . Eager vines</l>
       <l n="18">Go up the rocks and wait ; flushed apple-trees</l>
       <l n="19">Pause in their dance and break the ring for me ;</l>
       <l n="20">Dim , shady wood-roads , redolent of fern</l>
       <l n="21">And bayberry , that through sweet bevies thread</l>
       <l n="22">Of round-faced roses , pink and petulant ,</l>
       <l n="23">Look back and beckon ere they disappear .</l>
       <l n="24">Only my heart , only my heart responds .</l>
       <l n="25">Yet , ah , my path is sweet on either side</l>
       <l n="26">All through the dragging day ,— sharp underfoot</l>
       <l n="27">And hot , and like dead mist the dry dust hangs —</l>
       <l n="28">But far , oh , far as passionate eye can reach ,</l>
       <l n="29">And long , ah , long as rapturous eye can cling ,</l>
       <l n="30">The world is mine : blue hill , still silver lake ,</l>
       <l n="31">Broad field , bright flower , and the long white road</l>
       <l n="32">A gateless garden , and an open path :</l>
       <l n="33">My feet to follow , and my heart to hold .</l>

        <l n="155">Cherish you then the hope I shall forget</l>
        <l n="156">At length , my lord , Pieria ?— put away</l>
        <l n="157">For your so passing sake , this mouth of clay</l>
        <l n="158">These mortal bones against my body set ,</l>
        <l n="159">For all the puny fever and frail sweat</l>
        <l n="160">Of human love ,— renounce for these , I say ,</l>
        <l n="161">The Singing Mountain 's memory , and betray</l>
        <l n="162">The silent lyre that hangs upon me yet ?</l>
        <l n="163">Ah , but indeed , some day shall you awake ,</l>
        <l n="164">Rather , from dreams of me , that at your side</l>
        <l n="165">So many nights , a lover and a bride ,</l>
        <l n="166">But stern in my soul 's chastity , have lain ,</l>
        <l n="167">To walk the world forever for my sake ,</l>
        <l n="168">And in each chamber find me gone again !</l>

      <head>WILD SWANS</head>
       <l n="1">I looked in my heart while the wild swans went over .</l>
       <l n="2">And what did I see I had not seen before ?</l>
       <l n="3">Only a question less or a question more ;</l>
       <l n="4">Nothing to match the flight of wild birds flying .</l>
       <l n="5">Tiresome heart , forever living and dying ,</l>
       <l n="6">House without air , I leave you and lock your door .</l>
       <l n="7">Wild swans , come over the town , come over</l>
       <l n="8">The town again , trailing your legs and crying !</l>
