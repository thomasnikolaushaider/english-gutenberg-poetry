   <p>It rained outside right into Hadrian 's soul .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">The boy lay dead</l>
     <l n="2">On the low couch , on whose denuded whole ,</l>
     <l n="3">To Hadrian 's eyes , that at their seeing bled ,</l>
     <l n="4">The shadowy light of Death 's eclipse was shed .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">The boy lay dead and the day seemed a night</l>
     <l n="6">Outside . The rain fell like a sick affright</l>
     <l n="7">Of Nature at her work in killing him .</l>
     <l n="8">Through the mind 's galleries of their past delight</l>
     <l n="9">The very light of memory was dim .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="10">O hands that clasped erewhile Hadrian 's warm hands ,</l>
     <l n="11">That now found them but cold !</l>
     <l n="12">O hair bound erstwhile with the pressing bands !</l>
     <l n="13">O eyes too diffidently bold !</l>
     <l n="14">O bare female male-body like</l>
     <l n="15">A god that dawns into humanity !</l>
     <l n="16">O lips whose opening redness erst could strike</l>
     <l n="17">Lust 's seats with a soiled art 's variety !</l>
     <l n="18">O fingers skilled in things not to be named !</l>
     <l n="19">O tongue which , counter-tongued , the throbbed brows flamed !</l>
     <l n="20">O glory of a wrong lust pillowed on</l>
     <l n="21">Raged conciousness 's spilled suspension !</l>
     <l n="22">These things are things that now must be no more .</l>
     <l n="23">The rain is silent , and the Emperor</l>
     <l n="24">Sinks by the couch . His grief is like a rage ,</l>
     <l n="25">For the gods take away the life they give</l>
     <l n="26">And spoil the beauty they made live .</l>
     <l n="27">He weeps and knows that every future age</l>
     <l n="28">Is staring at him out of the to-be .</l>
     <l n="29">His love is on a universal stage .</l>
     <l n="30">A thousand unborn eyes weep with his misery .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="31">Antinous is dead , is dead forever ,</l>
     <l n="32">Is dead forever and the loves lament .</l>
     <l n="33">Venus herself , that was Adonis ’ lover ,</l>
     <l n="34">Seeing him again , having lived , dead again ,</l>
     <l n="35">Lends her great skyey grief now to be blent</l>
     <l n="36">With Hadrian 's pain .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="37">Now is Apollo sad because the stealer</l>
     <l n="38">Of his white body is forever cold .</l>
     <l n="39">In vain shall kisses on that nippled point</l>
     <l n="40">Covering his heart-beats ’ silent place implore</l>
     <l n="41">His life again to ope his eyes and feel her</l>
     <l n="42">Presence along his veins this fortress hold</l>
     <l n="43">Of love . Now no caressing hands anoint</l>
     <l n="44">With growing joy that body 's lusting lore .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="45">The rain falls , and he lies like one who hath</l>
     <l n="46">Forgotten all the gestures of his love</l>
     <l n="47">And lies awake waiting their hot return .</l>
     <l n="48">But all his vices ’ art is now with Death :</l>
     <l n="49">He lies with her , whose sex cannot him move ,</l>
     <l n="50">Whose hand , were't not cold , still ne'er his could burn .</l>
     <l n="51">Lilies were on his cheeks and roses too .</l>
     <l n="52">His eyes were sad in joy sometimes . He said</l>
     <l n="53">Oft in his close abandonments , that woo</l>
     <l n="54">Love to be more love than love can be , « Kiss</l>
     <l n="55">My eyelids till my closed eyes seem to guess</l>
     <l n="56">The kiss they feel laid in my heart 's breast-bed .»</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="57">O Hadrian , what shall now thy cold life be ?</l>
     <l n="58">What boots it to be emperor over all ?</l>
     <l n="59">His absence o'er thy visible empery</l>
     <l n="60">Throws a dim pall .</l>
     <l n="61">Now are thy nights widowed of love and kisses ,</l>
     <l n="62">Now are thy days robbed of the night 's awaiting ,</l>
     <l n="63">Now are thy lips purposeless and thy blisses</l>
     <l n="64">No longer of the size of thy life , mating</l>
     <l n="65">Thy empire with thy love 's bold tendernesses .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="66">Now are thy doors closed upon beauty and joy .</l>
     <l n="67">Throw ashes on thy head !</l>
     <l n="68">Lo , lift thine eyes and see the lovely boy !</l>
     <l n="69">Naked he lies upon that memoried bed ;</l>
     <l n="70">By thine own hand he lies uncovered .</l>
     <l n="71">There was he wont thy dangling sense to cloy ,</l>
     <l n="72">And uncloy with more cloying , and annoy</l>
     <l n="73">With newer uncloying till thy senses bled .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="74">His hand and mouth knew gamuts musical</l>
     <l n="75">Of vices thy worn spine was hurt to follow .</l>
     <l n="76">Sometimes it seemed to thee that all was hollow</l>
     <l n="77">In sense in each new straining of sucked lust .</l>
     <l n="78">Then still new crimes of fancy would he call</l>
     <l n="79">To thy shaken flesh , and thou wouldst tremble and fall</l>
     <l n="80">Back on thy cushions with thy mind 's sense hushed .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="81">« Beautiful was my love , yet melancholy .</l>
     <l n="82">He had that art , of love 's arts most unholy ,</l>
     <l n="83">Of being lithely sad among lust 's rages .</l>
     <l n="84">Now the Nile gave him up , the eternal Nile .</l>
     <l n="85">Under his wet locks Death 's blue paleness wages</l>
     <l n="86">Now war upon our pity with sad smile ».</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="87">Even as he thinks , the lust that is no more</l>
     <l n="88">Than a memory of lust revives and takes</l>
     <l n="89">His senses by the hand , and his flesh quakes</l>
     <l n="90">Till all becomes again what ‘ twas before .</l>
     <l n="91">The dead body on the bed gets up and lives</l>
     <l n="92">Along his every nerve ripped up and twanged ,</l>
     <l n="93">And a love-o'erhYpppHeNwise and invisible hand</l>
     <l n="94">At every body-entrance to his lust</l>
     <l n="95">Utters caresses which flit off , yet just</l>
     <l n="96">Remain enough to bleed his last nerve 's strand ,</l>
     <l n="97">O sweet and cruel Parthian fugitives !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="98">He rises , mad , and looks upon his lover ,</l>
     <l n="99">That now can love nothing but what none know .</l>
     <l n="100">Then his cold lips run all the body over —</l>
     <l n="101">His lips that scarce remember their warmth , now</l>
     <l n="102">So blent with feeling the death they behold ;</l>
     <l n="103">And so ice-senseless are his lips that , lo !,</l>
     <l n="104">He scarce tastes death from the dead body 's cold ,</l>
     <l n="105">But it seems both are dead or living both</l>
     <l n="106">And love is still the Presence and the Mover .</l>
     <l n="107">Then his lips cease on the other lips ’ cold sloth .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="108">But there the wanting breath reminds his lips</l>
     <l n="109">That between him and his boy-love the mist</l>
     <l n="110">That comes out of the gods has crept . The tips</l>
     <l n="111">Of his fingers , still idly tickling , list</l>
     <l n="112">To some flesh-response to their purple mood .</l>
     <l n="113">But their love-orison is not understood .</l>
     <l n="114">The god is dead whose cult was to be kissed !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="115">He lifts his hand up to where heaven should be</l>
     <l n="116">And cries on the mute gods to know his pain .</l>
     <l n="117">Lo , list !, o divine watchers of our glee</l>
     <l n="118">And sorrow !, list !, he will yield up his reign .</l>
     <l n="119">He will live in the deserts and be parched</l>
     <l n="120">On the hot sands , he will be beggar and slave ;</l>
     <l n="121">But give again the boy to be arm-reached !</l>
     <l n="122">Forego that space ye meant to be his grave !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="123">Take all the female beauties of the earth !</l>
     <l n="124">Take all afar and rend them if ye will !</l>
     <l n="125">But , by sweet Ganymede , that Jove found worth</l>
     <l n="126">And above Hebe did elect to fill</l>
     <l n="127">His cup at his high festivals , and spill</l>
     <l n="128">His fairer vice wherefrom comes newer birth —,</l>
     <l n="129">The clod of female embraces resolve</l>
     <l n="130">To dust , o father of the gods !, but spare</l>
     <l n="131">This boy and his white body and golden hair .</l>
     <l n="132">Maybe thy newer Ganymede thou m  eanst</l>
     <l n="133">That he should be , and out of jealous care</l>
     <l n="134">From Hadrian 's arms to thine his beauty steal'st .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="135">He was a kitten playing with lust , playing</l>
     <l n="136">With his own and with Hadrian 's , sometimes one</l>
     <l n="137">And sometimes two , now splitting , now one grown ,</l>
     <l n="138">Now leaving lust , now lust 's high lusts delaying ,</l>
     <l n="139">Now eyeing lust not wide , but from askance</l>
     <l n="140">Jumping round on lust 's half-unexpectance ;</l>
     <l n="141">Then softly gripping , then with fury holding ,</l>
     <l n="142">Now playfully playing , now seriously , now lying</l>
     <l n="143">By the side of lust looking at it , now spying</l>
     <l n="144">Which way to take lust in his lust 's withholding .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="145">Thus did the hours slide from their tangled hands</l>
     <l n="146">And from their mixed limbs the moments slip .</l>
     <l n="147">Now were his arms dead leaves , now iron bands ,</l>
     <l n="148">Now were his lips cups , now the things that sip ,</l>
     <l n="149">Now were his eyes too closed , and now too open ,</l>
     <l n="150">Now were his ways such as none thought might happen ,</l>
     <l n="151">Now were his arts a feather and now a whip .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="152">That love they lived as a religion</l>
     <l n="153">Offered to gods that do to presence bend .</l>
     <l n="154">Sometimes he was adorned and made to don</l>
     <l n="155">Half-costumes , now a posing nudity</l>
     <l n="156">That imitates some god 's eternity</l>
     <l n="157">Of body statue-known to craving men .</l>
     <l n="158">Now was he Venus , risen from the seas ;</l>
     <l n="159">And now was he Apollo , white and golden ;</l>
     <l n="160">Now as Jove sate he in mock-judgment over</l>
     <l n="161">The presence at his feet of his slaved lover ;</l>
     <l n="162">Now was he an acted rite , by one beholden ,</l>

     <l n="167">Too cold ! too cold ! and love as cold as he .</l>
     <l n="168">Love wanders through the memories of his vice</l>
     <l n="169">As through a labyrinth , in sad madness glad ,</l>
     <l n="170">And now calls on his name and bids him rise ,</l>
     <l n="171">And now is smiling at his imaged coming</l>
     <l n="172">That is i'th ' heart like faces in the gloaming —</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="20">
     <l n="174">The rain again like a vague pain arose</l>
