      <l n="3">I who come first from the clear font</l>
      <l n="4">Bringing the Grecian orgies into Italy , and the dance into Italy .</l>
      <l n="5">Who hath taught you so subtle a measure , in what hall have you heard it ;</l>
      <l n="6">What foot beat out your time-bar , what water has mellowed your whistles ?</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="2">
      <l n="7">Out-weariers of Apollo will , as we know , continue their Martian</l>
      <l n="8">generalities .</l>
      <l n="9">We have kept our erasers in order ,</l>
      <l n="10">A new-fangled chariot follows the flower-hung horses ;</l>
      <l n="11">A young Muse with young loves clustered about her ascends with me into</l>
      <l n="12">the aether , ...</l>
      <l n="13">And there is no high-road to the Muses .</l>

     <lg type="stanza" n="3">
      <l n="14">Annalists will continue to record Roman reputations ,</l>
      <l n="15">Celebrities from the Trans-Caucasus will belaud Roman celebrities</l>

      <l n="17">But for something to read in normal circumstances ?</l>
      <l n="18">For a few pages brought down from the forked hill unsullied ?</l>
      <l n="19">I ask a wreath which will not crush my head .</l>
      <l n="20">And there is no hurry about it ;</l>
      <l n="21">I shall have , doubtless , a boom after my funeral ,</l>
      <l n="22">Seeing that long standing increases all things regardless of quality .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="5">
      <l n="23">And who would have known the towers pulled down by a deal-wood horse ;</l>

      <l n="32">My vote coming from the temple of Phoebus in Lycia , at Patara ,</l>
      <l n="33">And in the mean time my songs will travel ,</l>
      <l n="34">And the devirginated young ladies will enjoy them when they have got</l>
      <l n="35">over the strangeness ,</l>
      <l n="36">For Orpheus tamed the wild beasts — and held up the Threician river ;</l>
      <l n="37">And Citharaon shook up the rocks by Thebes and danced them into a</l>
      <l n="38">bulwark at his pleasure ,</l>
      <l n="39">And you , O Polyphemus ? Did harsh Galatea almost</l>
      <l n="40">Turn to your dripping horses , because of a tune , under Aetna ?</l>
      <l n="41">We must look into the matter .</l>
      <l n="42">Bacchus and Apollo in favour of it ,</l>
      <l n="43">There will be a crowd of young women doing homage to my palaver ,</l>
      <l n="44">Though my house is not propped up by Taenarian columns from Laconia</l>
      <l n="45">( associated with Neptune and Cerberus ) ,</l>
      <l n="46">Though it is not stretched upon gilded beams ;</l>
      <l n="47">My orchards do not lie level and wide</l>
      <l n="48">as the forests of Phaecia ,</l>
      <l n="49">the luxurious and Ionian ,</l>
      <l n="50">Nor are my caverns stuffed stiff with a Marcian vintage ,</l>
      <l n="51">( My cellar does not date from Numa Pompilius ,</l>
      <l n="52">Nor bristle with wine jars )</l>
      <l n="53">Yet the companions of the Muses</l>
      <l n="54">will keep their collective nose in my books ,</l>
      <l n="55">And weary with historical data , they will turn to my dance tune .</l>

      <l n="56">Happy who are mentioned in my pamphlets , the songs shall be a fine</l>
      <l n="57">tomb-stone over their beauty .</l>
      <l n="58">But against this ?</l>
      <l n="59">Neither expensive pyramids scraping the stars in their route ,</l>
      <l n="60">Nor houses modelled upon that of Jove in East Elis ,</l>
      <l n="61">Nor the monumental effigies of Mausolus ,</l>
      <l n="62">are a complete elucidation of death .</l>
      <l n="63">Flame burns , rain sinks into the cracks</l>

   <p>Thus all roads are perfectly safe and at any hour ; Who so indecorous as to shed the pure gore of a suitor ? I Cypris is his cicerone .</p>
   <p>What if undertakers follow my track , such a death is worth dying . She would bring frankincense and wreaths to my tomb , She would sit like an ornament on my pyre .</p>
   <p>Gods ’ aid , let not my bones lie in a public location with crowds too assiduous in their crossing of it ; For thus are tombs of lovers most desecrated .</p>
   <p>May a woody and sequestered place cover me with its foliage Or may I inter beneath the hummock of some as yet uncatalogued sand ; At any rate I shall not have my epitaph in a high road .</p>

     <l n="8">No messenger should come wholly empty ,</l>

     <l n="20">Sad garment draped on her slender arms .</l>

In abuleia . But Don Lorenzino “ Whether for love of Florence ... but : “ O si morisse , credesse caduto da se .” SIGA , SIGA ! The wet cloak floats on the surface , Schiavoni , caught on the wood-barge , Gives out the afterbirth , Giovanni Borgia Trails out no more at night , where Barabello Prods the Pope ’ s elephant , and gets no crown , where Mozarello Takes the Calabrian roadway , and for ending Is smothered beneath a mule , a poet ’ s ending , Down a stale well-hole , oh a poet ’ s ending . “ Sanazarro “ Alone out of all the court was faithful to him ” For the gossip of Naples ’ trouble drifts to North , Fracastor ( lightning was midwife ) Cotta , and Ser D ’ Alviano , Al poco giorno ed al gran cerchio d ’ ombra , Talk the talks out with Navighero , Burner of yearly Martials , ( The slavelet is mourned in vain ) And the next comer says “ were nine wounds , “ Four men , white horse with a double rider ,” The hooves clink and slick on the cobbles ... Schiavoni ... the cloak floats on the water , “ Sink the thing ,” splash wakes Schiavoni ; Tiber catching the nap , the moonlit velvet , Wet cat , gleaming in patches . “ Se pia ,” Varchi , “ O empia , ma risoluto “ E terribile deliberazione ” Both sayings run in the wind , Ma si morisse !</p>
