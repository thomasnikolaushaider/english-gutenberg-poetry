   <p>II</p>
   <p>The first eighty poems are lyric . In the usual sense . They are not much different from poetry that praises gardens . The content is the distress of love , death , universal longing . The impulse to formulate them in the “ cynical ” vein ( like cabaret songs ) may , for example , might have arisen from the wish to feel superior . Most of the eighty poems are insignificant . They were not presented to the public . All except one ( one of the last ) That is :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">I want to bury myself in the night ,</l>
     <l n="2">Naked and shy .</l>
     <l n="3">And to wrap darknesses around my limbs</l>
     <l n="4">And warm luster .</l>
     <l n="5">I want to wander far behind the hills of the earth .</l>
     <l n="6">Deep beyond the gliding oceans .</l>
     <l n="7">Past the singing winds .</l>
     <l n="8">There I 'll meet the silent stars .</l>
     <l n="9">They carry space through time .</l>
     <l n="10">And live at the death of being .</l>
     <l n="11">And among them are gray ,</l>
     <l n="12">Isolated things .</l>
     <l n="13">Faded movement</l>
     <l n="14">Of worlds long decayed .</l>
     <l n="15">Lost sound .</l>
     <l n="16">Who can know that .</l>
     <l n="17">My blind dream watches far from earthly wishes .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>III</p>
   <p>The following poems can be divided into three groups . One combines fantastic , half-playful images : The Sad Man , Rubbers , Capriccio , The Patent-Leather Shoe , A Barkeeper 's Coarse Complaint . ( First appeared in Aktion , in Simplicissimus , in March , Pan and elsewhere ) . Pleasure in what is purely artistic is unmistakable .</p>
   <p>Examples : The Athlete : in the background is a demonstration of a view of the world . The Athlete ... means that it is terrible that a man must also intellectually move his bowels .— Rubbers : a man wearing rubbers is different without them .</p>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">The earliest poetry forms a second group :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="2">Twilight</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>The intention is to eliminate the difference between time and space in favor of the idea of poetry . The poems want to represent the effect of twilight on the landscape .</p>
   <p>In this case the unity of time is necessary to a certain degree . The unity of space is not required , therefore not observed . In twelve lines the twilight is represented on a pond , tree , field , somewhere ... its effect on the appearance of a young man , a wind , a sky , two cripples , a poet , a horse , a lady , a man , a young boy , a woman , a clown , a baby-carriage , some dogs is represented visually . ( The expression is poor , but I can find nothing better )</p>
   <p>The author of the poem does not want to portray a landscape that is thought to be real . The poetic art has the advantage over painting of offering “ ideal ” images . That means — in respect to the Twilight : the fat boy who uses the big pond as a toy , and the two cripples on crutches in the field and the woman on the city street who was knocked down by a cart-horse in the half-darkness , and the poet who , filled with desperate longing , is thinking in the evening ( probably looking through a skylight ) , and the circus clown in the gray rear building who is sighing as he puts on his boots in order to arrive punctually at the performance , in which he must be funny — all these can produce a poetic “ picture , ” although they cannot be composed like a painting . Most still deny that , and for that reason recognize , for example , in the “ Twilight ” and similar pictures nothing but a mindless confusion of strange performances . Others believe , incorrectly , that these kinds of “ ideal ” pictures are possible in painting ( for example , the Futurist mish mash ) .</p>
   <p>The intention , furthermore , to grasp the reflex of things directly — without superfluous reflections . Lichtenstein knows that the man is not stuck to the window , but stands behind it . That the baby-carriage is not screaming , but the child in the baby-carriage . Because he can only see the baby-carriage , he writes : the baby-carriage cries . It would have been untrue lyrically had he written : a man stands behind a window .</p>
   <p>By chance , it is conceptually also not untrue : a boy plays with a pond . A horse stumbles over a lady . Dogs swear . Certainly one must laugh in an odd way when one learns to see : that a boy actually uses a pond as a toy . How horses have a helpless way of stumbling ... how human dogs express their rage ...</p>
   <p>Sometimes the representation of reflection is important . Perhaps a poet goes mad — makes a deeper impression than — a poet stares stiffly ahead —</p>
   <p>Something else compelling in the poem : fear and things that resemble reflection , like : all men must die ... or : I am only a little book of pictures ... that will not be discussed here .</p>
   <p>V</p>
   <p>That Twilight and other poems take things strangely ( The comic is experienced tragically . The representation is “ grotesque ” ) , to notice the unbalanced , incoherent nature of things , arbitrariness , confusion ... is not , in any case , the characteristic of “ style . ” Proof is : Lichtenstein writes poems in which the “ grotesque ” disappears , without notice , behind the “ ungrotesque . ”</p>
   <p>Other differences between older poems ( for example , Twilight ) and later ones ( for example , Fear ) in the same style are detectable . One might observe that ever increasing idiosyncratic reflections about landscape clearly break through . Certainly not without artistic purpose .</p>
