    <head>PREFACE</head>
    <p n="1">In March , 1914 , a volume appeared entitled “ Des Imagistes . ” It was a collection of the work of various young poets , presented together as a school . This school has been widely discussed by those interested in new movements in the arts , and has already become a household word . Differences of taste and judgment , however , have arisen among the contributors to that book ; growing tendencies are forcing them along different paths . Those of us whose work appears in this volume have therefore decided to publish our collection under a new title , and we have been joined by two or three poets who did not contribute to the first volume , our wider scope making this possible .</p>
    <p n="2">In this new book we have followed a slightly different arrangement to that of the former Anthology . Instead of an arbitrary selection by an editor , each poet has been permitted to represent himself by the work he considers his best , the only stipulation being that it should not yet have appeared in book form . A sort of informal committee — consisting of more than half the authors here represented — have arranged the book and decided what should be printed and what omitted , but , as a general rule , the poets have been allowed absolute freedom in this direction , limitations of space only being imposed upon them . Also , to avoid any appearance of precedence , they have been put in alphabetical order .</p>
    <p n="3">As it has been suggested that much of the misunderstanding of the former volume was due to the fact that we did not explain ourselves in a preface , we have thought it wise to tell the public what our aims are , and why we are banded together between one set of covers .</p>
    <p n="4">The poets in this volume do not represent a clique . Several of them are personally unknown to the others , but they are united by certain common principles , arrived at independently . These principles are not new ; they have fallen into desuetude . They are the essentials of all great poetry , indeed of all great literature , and they are simply these :—</p>
    <p n="5">1 . To use the language of common speech , but to employ always the exact word , not the nearly-exact , nor the merely decorative word .</p>
    <p n="6">2 . To create new rhythms — as the expression of new moods — and not to copy old rhythms , which merely echo old moods . We do not insist upon “ free-verse ” as the only method of writing poetry . We fight for it as for a principle of liberty . We believe that the individuality of a poet may often be better expressed in free-verse than in conventional forms . In poetry , a new cadence means a new idea .</p>
    <p n="7">3 . To allow absolute freedom in the choice of subject . It is not good art to write badly about aeroplanes and automobiles ; nor is it necessarily bad art to write well about the past . We believe passionately in the artistic value of modern life , but we wish to point out that there is nothing so uninspiring nor so old-fashioned as an aeroplane of the year 1911 .</p>
    <p n="8">4 . To present an image ( hence the name : “ Imagist ” ) . We are not a school of painters , but we believe that poetry should render particulars exactly and not deal in vague generalities , however magnificent and sonorous . It is for this reason that we oppose the cosmic poet , who seems to us to shirk the real difficulties of his art .</p>
    <p n="9">5 . To produce poetry that is hard and clear , never blurred nor indefinite .</p>
    <p n="10">6 . Finally , most of us believe that concentration is of the very essence of poetry .</p>
    <p n="11">The subject of free-verse is too complicated to be discussed here . We may say briefly , that we attach the term to all that increasing amount of writing whose cadence is more marked , more definite , and closer knit than that of prose , but which is not so violently nor so obviously accented as the so-called “ regular verse . ” We refer those interested in the question to the Greek Melic poets , and to the many excellent French studies on the subject by such distinguished and well-equipped authors as Remy de Gourmont , Gustave Kahn , Georges Duhamel , Charles Vildrac , Henri Ghéon , Robert de Souza , André Spire , etc .</p>
    <p n="12">We wish it to be clearly understood that we do not represent an exclusive artistic sect ; we publish our work together because of mutual artistic sympathy , and we propose to bring out our coöperative volume each year for a short term of years , until we have made a place for ourselves and our principles such as we desire .</p>

        <l n="10">I 've seen people put</l>
        <l n="11">A chrysalis in a match-box ,</l>
        <l n="12">“ To see , ” they told me , “ what sort of moth would come . ”</l>
        <l n="13">But when it broke its shell</l>
        <l n="14">It slipped and stumbled and fell about its prison</l>
        <l n="15">And tried to climb to the light</l>
        <l n="16">For space to dry its wings .</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="3">
        <l n="17">That 's how I was .</l>
        <l n="18">Somebody found my chrysalis</l>
        <l n="19">And shut it in a match-box .</l>
        <l n="20">My shrivelled wings were beaten ,</l>
        <l n="21">Shed their colours in dusty scales</l>
        <l n="22">Before the box was opened</l>
        <l n="23">For the moth to fly .</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="4">
        <l n="24">And then it was too late ,</l>
        <l n="25">Because the beauty a child has ,</l>
        <l n="26">And the beautiful things it learns before its birth ,</l>
        <l n="27">Were shed , like moth-scales , from me .</l>
       </lg>
      </lg>

       <head>III</head>
       <lg type="stanza" n="5">
        <l n="28">I hate that town ;</l>
        <l n="29">I hate the town I lived in when I was little ;</l>
        <l n="30">I hate to think of it .</l>
        <l n="31">There were always clouds , smoke , rain</l>
        <l n="32">In that dingy little valley .</l>
        <l n="33">It rained ; it always rained .</l>
        <l n="34">I think I never saw the sun until I was nine —</l>
        <l n="35">And then it was too late ;</l>
        <l n="36">Everything 's too late after the first seven years .</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="6">
        <l n="37">That long street we lived in</l>
        <l n="38">Was duller than a drain</l>
        <l n="39">And nearly as dingy .</l>
        <l n="40">There were the big College</l>
        <l n="41">And the pseudo-Gothic town-hall .</l>
        <l n="42">There were the sordid provincial shops —</l>
        <l n="43">The grocer 's , and the shops for women ,</l>
        <l n="44">The shop where I bought transfers ,</l>
        <l n="45">And the piano and gramaphone shop</l>
        <l n="46">Where I used to stand</l>
        <l n="47">Staring at the huge shiny pianos and at the pictures</l>
        <l n="48">Of a white dog looking into a gramaphone .</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="7">
        <l n="49">How dull and greasy and grey and sordid it was !</l>
        <l n="50">On wet days — it was always wet —</l>
        <l n="51">I used to kneel on a chair</l>
        <l n="52">And look at it from the window .</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="8">
        <l n="53">The dirty yellow trams</l>
        <l n="54">Dragged noisily along</l>
        <l n="55">With a clatter of wheels and bells</l>
        <l n="56">And a humming of wires overhead .</l>
        <l n="57">They threw up the filthy rain-water from the hollow lines</l>
        <l n="58">And then the water ran back</l>
        <l n="59">Full of brownish foam bubbles .</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="9">
        <l n="60">There was nothing else to see —</l>
        <l n="61">It was all so dull —</l>
        <l n="62">Except a few grey legs under shiny black umbrellas</l>
        <l n="63">Running along the grey shiny pavements ;</l>
        <l n="64">Sometimes there was a waggon</l>
        <l n="65">Whose horses made a strange loud hollow sound</l>
        <l n="66">With their hoofs</l>
        <l n="67">Through the silent rain .</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="10">
        <l n="68">And there was a grey museum</l>
        <l n="69">Full of dead birds and dead insects and dead animals</l>
        <l n="70">And a few relics of the Romans — dead also .</l>
        <l n="71">There was the sea-front ,</l>
        <l n="72">A long asphalt walk with a bleak road beside it ,</l>
        <l n="73">Three piers , a row of houses ,</l>
        <l n="74">And a salt dirty smell from the little harbour .</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="11">
        <l n="75">I was like a moth — -</l>
        <l n="76">Like one of those grey Emperor moths</l>
        <l n="77">Which flutter through the vines at Capri .</l>
        <l n="78">And that damned little town was my match-box ,</l>
        <l n="79">Against whose sides I beat and beat</l>
        <l n="80">Until my wings were torn and faded , and dingy</l>
        <l n="81">As that damned little town .</l>
       </lg>

       <head>IV</head>
       <lg type="stanza" n="12">
        <l n="82">At school it was just dull as that dull High Street .</l>
        <l n="83">They taught me pothooks —</l>
        <l n="84">I wanted to be alone , although I was so little ,</l>
        <l n="85">Alone , away from the rain , the dingyness , the dullness ,</l>
        <l n="86">Away somewhere else —</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="13">
        <l n="87">The town was dull ;</l>
        <l n="88">The front was dull ;</l>
        <l n="89">The High Street and the other street were dull —</l>
        <l n="90">And there was a public park , I remember ,</l>
        <l n="91">And that was damned dull too ,</l>
        <l n="92">With its beds of geraniums no one was allowed to pick ,</l>
        <l n="93">And its clipped lawns you were n't allowed to walk on ,</l>
        <l n="94">And the gold-fish pond you must n't paddle in ,</l>
        <l n="95">And the gate made out of a whale 's jaw-bones ,</l>
        <l n="96">And the swings , which were for “ Board-School children , ”</l>
        <l n="97">And its gravel paths .</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="14">
        <l n="98">And on Sundays they rang the bells ,</l>
        <l n="99">From Baptist and Evangelical and Catholic churches .</l>
        <l n="100">They had the Salvation Army .</l>
        <l n="101">I was taken to a High Church ;</l>
        <l n="102">The parson 's name was Mowbray ,</l>
        <l n="103">“ Which is a good name but he thinks too much of it — ”</l>
        <l n="104">That 's what I heard people say .</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="15">
        <l n="105">I took a little black book</l>
        <l n="106">To that cold , grey , damp , smelling church ,</l>
        <l n="107">And I had to sit on a hard bench ,</l>
        <l n="108">Wriggle off it to kneel down when they sang psalms ,</l>
        <l n="109">And wriggle off it to kneel down when they prayed —</l>
        <l n="110">And then there was nothing to do</l>

     <p>Elm trees and the leaf the boy in me hated long ago — rough and sandy .</p>
     <p>Poplars and their leaves , tender , smooth to the fingers , and a secret in their smell I have forgotten .</p>
     <p>Oaks and forest glades , heart aching with wonder , fear : their bitter mast .</p>
     <p>Willows and the scented beetle we put in our handkerchiefs ; and the roots of one that spread into a river : nakedness , water and joy .</p>
     <p>Hawthorn , white and odorous with blossom , framing the quiet fields , and swaying flowers and grasses , and the hum of bees .</p>
     <p>Oh , these are the things that are with me now , in the town ; and I am grateful for this minute of my manhood .</p>

     <p>Therefore , I sit here among the people , dreaming , and my heart aches with all the hawthorn blossom , the bees humming , the light wind upon the poplars , and your warmth and your love and your eyes ... they smile and know me .</p>

     <head>FRAGMENT</head>
     <p>... That night I loved you in the candlelight . Your golden hair strewed the sweet whiteness of the pillows and the counterpane . O the darkness of the corners , the warm air , and the stars framed in the casement of the ships ’ lights ! The waves lapped into the harbour ; the boats creaked ; a man 's voice sang out on the quay ; and you loved me . In your love were the tall tree fuchsias , the blue of the hortensias , the scarlet nasturtiums , the trees on the hills , the roads we had covered , and the sea that had borne your body before the rocks of Hartland . You loved me with these and with the kindness of people , country folk , sailors and fishermen , and the old lady who had lodged us and supped us . You loved me with yourself that was these and more , changed as the earth is changed into the bloom of flowers .</p>

     <p>Evening and quiet : a bird trills in the poplar trees behind the house with the dark green door across the road .</p>
     <p>Into the sky , the red earthenware and the galvanised iron chimneys thrust their cowls . The hoot of the steamers on the Thames is plain .</p>
     <p>No wind ; the trees merge , green with green ; a car whirs by ; footsteps and voices take their pitch in the key of dusk , far-off and near , subdued .</p>
     <p>Solid and square to the world the houses stand , their windows blocked with venetian blinds .</p>
     <p>Nothing will move them .</p>

      <head>SCENT OF IRISES</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">A faint , sickening scent of irises</l>
       <l n="2">Persists all morning . Here in a jar on the table</l>
       <l n="3">A fine proud spike of purple irises</l>
       <l n="4">Rising above the class-room litter , makes me unable</l>
       <l n="5">To see the class 's lifted and bended faces</l>
       <l n="6">Save in a broken pattern , amid purple and gold and sable .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="7">I can smell the gorgeous bog-end , in its breathless</l>
       <l n="8">Dazzle of may-blobs , when the marigold glare overcast</l>
       <l n="9">You with fire on your brow and your cheeks and your chin as you dipped</l>
       <l n="10">Your face in your marigold bunch , to touch and contrast</l>
       <l n="11">Your own dark mouth with the bridal faint lady-smocks</l>
       <l n="12">Dissolved in the golden sorcery you should not outlast .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="13">You amid the bog-end 's yellow incantation ,</l>
       <l n="14">You sitting in the cowslips of the meadows above ,</l>
       <l n="15">— Me , your shadow on the bog-flame , flowery may-blobs ,</l>
       <l n="16">Me full length in the cowslips , muttering you love —</l>
       <l n="17">You , your soul like a lady-smock , lost , evanescent ,</l>
       <l n="18">You , with your face all rich , like the sheen on a dove —!</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="19">You are always asking , do I remember , remember</l>
       <l n="20">The buttercup bog-end where the flowers rose up</l>
       <l n="21">And kindled you over deep with a coat of gold ?</l>
       <l n="22">You ask again , do the healing days close up</l>
       <l n="23">The open darkness which then drew us in ,</l>
       <l n="24">The dark that swallows all , and nought throws up .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="25">You upon the dry , dead beech-leaves , in the fire of night</l>
       <l n="26">Burnt like a sacrifice ;— you invisible —</l>
       <l n="27">Only the fire of darkness , and the scent of you !</l>
       <l n="28">— And yes , thank God , it still is possible</l>
       <l n="29">The healing days shall close the darkness up</l>
       <l n="30">Wherein I breathed you like a smoke or dew .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="31">Like vapour , dew , or poison . Now , thank God ,</l>
       <l n="32">The golden fire has gone , and your face is ash</l>
       <l n="33">Indistinguishable in the grey , chill day ,</l>
       <l n="34">The night has burnt you out , at last the good</l>
       <l n="35">Dark fire burns on untroubled without clash</l>
       <l n="36">Of you upon the dead leaves saying me yea .</l>

     <head>THE BOMBARDMENT</head>
     <p>Slowly , without force , the rain drops into the city . It stops a moment on the carved head of Saint John , then slides on again , slipping and trickling over his stone cloak . It splashes from the lead conduit of a gargoyle , and falls from it in turmoil on the stones in the Cathedral square . Where are the people , and why does the fretted steeple sweep about in the sky ? Boom ! The sound swings against the rain . Boom , again ! After it , only water rushing in the gutters , and the turmoil from the spout of the gargoyle . Silence . Ripples and mutters . Boom !</p>
     <p>The room is damp , but warm . Little flashes swarm about from the firelight . The lustres of the chandelier are bright , and clusters of rubies leap in the bohemian glasses on the étagère . Her hands are restless , but the white masses of her hair are quite still . Boom ! Will it never cease to torture , this iteration ! Boom ! The vibration shatters a glass on the étagère . It lies there formless and glowing , with all its crimson gleams shot out of pattern , spilled , flowing red , blood-red . A thin bell-note pricks through the silence . A door creaks . The old lady speaks : “ Victor , clear away that broken glass . ” “ Alas ! Madame , the bohemian glass ! ” “ Yes , Victor , one hundred years ago my father brought it — ” Boom ! The room shakes , the servitor quakes . Another goblet shivers and breaks . Boom !</p>
     <p>It rustles at the window-pane , the smooth , streaming rain , and he is shut within its clash and murmur . Inside is his candle , his table , his ink , his pen , and his dreams . He is thinking , and the walls are pierced with beams of sunshine , slipping through young green . A fountain tosses itself up at the blue sky , and through the spattered water in the basin he can see copper carp , lazily floating among cold leaves . A wind-harp in a cedar-tree grieves and whispers , and words blow into his brain , bubbled , iridescent , shooting up like flowers of fire , higher and higher . Boom ! The flame-flowers snap on their slender stems . The fountain rears up in long broken spears of disheveled water and flattens into the earth . Boom ! And there is only the room , the table , the candle , and the sliding rain . Again , Boom !— Boom !— Boom ! He stuffs his fingers into his ears . He sees corpses , and cries out in fright . Boom ! It is night , and they are shelling the city ! Boom ! Boom !</p>
     <p>A child wakes and is afraid , and weeps in the darkness . What has made the bed shake ? “ Mother , where are you ? I am awake . ” “ Hush , my Darling , I am here . ” “ But , Mother , something so queer happened , the room shook . ” Boom ! “ Oh ! What is it ? What is the matter ? ” Boom ! “ Where is Father ? I am so afraid . ” Boom ! The child sobs and shrieks . The house trembles and creaks . Boom !</p>
     <p>Retorts , globes , tubes , and phials lie shattered . All his trials oozing across the floor . The life that was his choosing , lonely , urgent , goaded by a hope , all gone . A weary man in a ruined laboratory , that was his story . Boom ! Gloom and ignorance , and the jig of drunken brutes . Diseases like snakes crawling over the earth , leaving trails of slime . Wails from people burying their dead . Through the window he can see the rocking steeple . A ball of fire falls on the lead of the roof , and the sky tears apart on a spike of flame . Up the spire , behind the lacings of stone , zig-zagging in and out of the carved tracings , squirms the fire . It spouts like yellow wheat from the gargoyles , coils round the head of Saint John , and aureoles him in light . It leaps into the night and hisses against the rain . The Cathedral is a burning stain on the white , wet night .</p>
     <p>Boom ! The Cathedral is a torch , and the houses next to it begin to scorch . Boom ! The bohemian glass on the étagère is no longer there . Boom ! A stalk of flame sways against the red damask curtains . The old lady cannot walk . She watches the creeping stalk and counts . Boom !— Boom !— Boom !</p>
     <p>The poet rushes into the street , and the rain wraps him in a sheet of silver . But it is threaded with gold and powdered with scarlet beads . The city burns . Quivering , spearing , thrusting , lapping , streaming , run the flames . Over roofs , and walls , and shops , and stalls . Smearing its gold on the sky the fire dances , lances itself through the doors , and lisps and chuckles along the floors .</p>
     <p>The child wakes again and screams at the yellow petalled flower flickering at the window . The little red lips of flame creep along the ceiling beams .</p>
     <p>The old man sits among his broken experiments and looks at the burning Cathedral . Now the streets are swarming with people . They seek shelter and crowd into the cellars . They shout and call , and over all , slowly and without force , the rain drops into the city . Boom ! And the steeple crashes down among the people . Boom ! Boom , again ! The water rushes along the gutters . The fire roars and mutters . Boom !</p>
