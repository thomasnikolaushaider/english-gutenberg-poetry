    <head>THE LIGHTED WINDOW</head>
    <head>HE SAID : “ In the winter dusk When the pavements were gleaming with rain , I walked thru a dingy street Hurried , harassed , Thinking of all my problems that never are solved . Suddenly out of the mist , a flaring gas-jet Shone from a huddled shop . I saw thru the bleary window A mass of playthings : False-faces hung on strings , Valentines , paper and tinsel , Tops of scarlet and green , Candy , marbles , jacks — A confusion of color Pathetically gaudy and cheap . All of my boyhood Rushed back . Once more these things were treasures Wildly desired . With covetous eyes I looked again at the marbles , The precious agates , the pee-wees , the chinies — Then I passed on .</head>
     <l n="1">In the winter dusk ,</l>
     <l n="2">The pavements were gleaming with rain ;</l>
     <l n="3">There in the lighted window</l>
     <l n="4">I left my boyhood . ”</l>

     <l n="4">Like theirs again ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">I sought the sea , she sent her winds to meet me ,</l>
     <l n="6">They surged about me singing of the south —</l>
     <l n="7">I turned my head away to keep still holy</l>
     <l n="8">Your kiss upon my mouth .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">And swift sweet rains of shining April weather</l>
     <l n="10">Found not my lips where living kisses are ;</l>
     <l n="11">I bowed my head lest they put out my glory</l>
     <l n="12">As rain puts out a star .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">I am my love 's and he is mine forever ,</l>
     <l n="14">Sealed with a seal and safe forevermore —</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">NIGHT is over the park , and a few brave stars</l>
     <l n="2">Look on the lights that link it with chains of gold ,</l>
     <l n="3">The lake bears up their reflection in broken bars</l>
     <l n="4">That seem too heavy for tremulous water to hold .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">We watch the swans that sleep in a shadowy place ,</l>
     <l n="6">And now and again one wakes and uplifts its head ;</l>
     <l n="7">How still you are — your gaze is on my face —</l>
     <l n="8">We watch the swans and never a word is said .</l>

     <l n="5">Her hair was dull and drew no light</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">Her body was a thing grown thin ,</l>
     <l n="10">Hungry for love that never came ;</l>

     <l n="13">I felt my lover look at her</l>

      <l n="111">Points north to Lesbos , and the splendid sea</l>
      <l n="112">That you have never seen , oh evening-eyed .</l>
      <l n="113">Yet have you never wondered what the Nile</l>
      <l n="114">Is seeking always , restless and wild with spring</l>
      <l n="115">And no less in the winter , seeking still ?</l>
      <l n="116">How shall I tell you ? Can you think of fields</l>
      <l n="117">Greater than Gods could till , more blue than night</l>
      <l n="118">Sown over with the stars ; and delicate</l>
      <l n="119">With filmy nets of foam that come and go ?</l>
      <l n="120">It is more cruel and more compassionate</l>
      <l n="121">Than harried earth . It takes with unconcern</l>
      <l n="122">And quick forgetting , rapture of the rain</l>
      <l n="123">And agony of thunder , the moon 's white</l>
      <l n="124">Soft-garmented virginity , and then</l>
      <l n="125">The insatiable ardor of the sun .</l>
      <l n="126">And me it took . But there is one more strong ,</l>
      <l n="127">Love , that came laughing from the elder seas ,</l>
      <l n="128">The Cyprian , the mother of the world ;</l>
      <l n="129">She gave me love who only asked for death —</l>
      <l n="130">I who had seen much sorrow in men 's eyes</l>
      <l n="131">And in my own too sorrowful a fire .</l>
      <l n="132">I was a sister of the stars , and yet</l>
      <l n="133">Shaken with pain ; sister of birds and yet</l>
      <l n="134">The wings that bore my soul were very tired .</l>
      <l n="135">I watched the careless spring too many times</l>
      <l n="136">Light her green torches in a hungry wind ;</l>
      <l n="137">Too many times I watched them flare , and then</l>
      <l n="138">Fall to forsaken embers in the autumn .</l>
      <l n="139">And I was sick of all things — even song .</l>
      <l n="140">In the dull autumn dawn I turned to death ,</l>
      <l n="141">Buried my living body in the sea ,</l>
      <l n="142">The strong cold sea that takes and does not give —</l>
      <l n="143">But there is one more strong , the Cyprian .</l>
      <l n="144">Litis , to wake from sleep and find your eyes</l>
      <l n="145">Met in their first fresh upward gaze by love ,</l>
      <l n="146">Filled with love 's happy shame from other eyes ,</l>
      <l n="147">Dazzled with tenderness and drowned in light</l>
      <l n="148">As tho ’ you looked unthinking at the sun ,</l>
      <l n="149">Oh Litis , that is joy ! But if you came</l>
      <l n="150">Not from the sunny shallow pool of sleep ,</l>
      <l n="151">But from the sea of death , the strangling sea</l>
      <l n="152">Of night and nothingness , and waked to find</l>
      <l n="153">Love looking down upon you , glad and still ,</l>
      <l n="154">Strange and yet known forever , that is peace .</l>
      <l n="155">So did he lean above me . Not a word</l>
      <l n="156">He spoke ; I only heard the morning sea</l>
      <l n="157">Singing against his happy ship , the keen</l>
      <l n="158">And straining joy of wind-awakened sails</l>
      <l n="159">And songs of mariners , and in myself</l>
      <l n="160">The precious pain of arms that held me fast .</l>
      <l n="161">They warmed the cold sea out of all my blood ;</l>
      <l n="162">I slept , feeling his eyes above my sleep .</l>
      <l n="163">There on the ship with wines and olives laden ,</l>
      <l n="164">Led by the stars to far invisible ports ,</l>
      <l n="165">Egypt and islands of the inner seas ,</l>
      <l n="166">Love came to me , and Cercolas was love .</l>

      <l n="168">The twilight 's inner flame grows blue and deep ,</l>
      <l n="169">And in my Lesbos , over leagues of sea ,</l>
      <l n="170">The temples glimmer moon-wise in the trees .</l>
      <l n="171">Twilight has veiled the little flower-face</l>
      <l n="172">Here on my heart , but still the night is kind</l>
      <l n="173">And leaves her warm sweet weight against my breast .</l>
      <l n="174">Am I that Sappho who would run at dusk</l>
      <l n="175">Along the surges creeping up the shore</l>
      <l n="176">When tides came in to ease the hungry beach ,</l>
      <l n="177">And running , running till the night was black ,</l>
      <l n="178">Would fall forespent upon the chilly sand</l>
      <l n="179">And quiver with the winds from off the sea ?</l>
      <l n="180">Ah quietly the shingle waits the tides</l>
      <l n="181">Whose waves are stinging kisses , but to me</l>
      <l n="182">Love brought no peace , nor darkness any rest .</l>
      <l n="183">I crept and touched the foam with fevered hands</l>
      <l n="184">And cried to Love , from whom the sea is sweet ,</l>
      <l n="185">From whom the sea is bitterer than death .</l>
      <l n="186">Ah , Aphrodite , if I sing no more</l>
      <l n="187">To thee , God 's daughter , powerful as God ,</l>
      <l n="188">It is that thou hast made my life too sweet</l>
      <l n="189">To hold the added sweetness of a song .</l>
      <l n="190">There is a quiet at the heart of love ,</l>
      <l n="191">And I have pierced the pain and come to peace</l>
      <l n="192">I hold my peace , my Cle &amp; iuml ; s , on my heart ;</l>
      <l n="193">And softer than a little wild bird 's wing</l>
      <l n="194">Are kisses that she pours upon my mouth .</l>
      <l n="195">Ah never any more when spring like fire</l>
      <l n="196">Will flicker in the newly opened leaves ,</l>
      <l n="197">Shall I steal forth to seek for solitude</l>
      <l n="198">Beyond the lure of light Alcaeus ’ lyre ,</l>
      <l n="199">Beyond the sob that stilled Erinna 's voice .</l>
      <l n="200">Ah , never with a throat that aches with song ,</l>
      <l n="201">Beneath the white uncaring sky of spring ,</l>
      <l n="202">Shall I go forth to hide awhile from Love</l>
      <l n="203">The quiver and the crying of my heart .</l>
      <l n="204">Still I remember how I strove to flee</l>
      <l n="205">The love-note of the birds , and bowed my head</l>
      <l n="206">To hurry faster , but upon the ground</l>
      <l n="207">I saw two wing &amp; egrave ; d shadows side by side ,</l>
      <l n="208">And all the world 's spring passion stifled me .</l>
      <l n="209">Ah , Love there is no fleeing from thy might ,</l>
      <l n="210">No lonely place where thou hast never trod ,</l>
      <l n="211">No desert thou hast left uncarpeted</l>
      <l n="212">With flowers that spring beneath thy perfect feet .</l>
      <l n="213">In many guises didst thou come to me ;</l>
      <l n="214">I saw thee by the maidens while they danced ,</l>
      <l n="215">Phaon allured me with a look of thine ,</l>
      <l n="216">In Anactoria I knew thy grace ,</l>
      <l n="217">I looked at Cercolas and saw thine eyes ;</l>
      <l n="218">But never wholly , soul and body mine ,</l>
      <l n="219">Didst thou bid any love me as I loved .</l>
      <l n="220">Now have I found the peace that fled from me ;</l>
      <l n="221">Close , close against my heart I hold my world .</l>
      <l n="222">Ah , Love that made my life a Iyric cry ,</l>
      <l n="223">Ah , Love that tuned my lips to Iyres of thine ,</l>
      <l n="224">I taught the world thy music , now alone</l>
      <l n="225">I sing for one who falls asleep to hear .</l>
