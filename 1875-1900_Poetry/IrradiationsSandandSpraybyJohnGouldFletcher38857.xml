    <head>PREFACE</head>
    <p n="1">The art of poetry as practised in the English-speaking countries to-day , is in a greatly backward state . Among the reading public there are exactly three opinions generally held about it . The first , and by far the most popular , view is that all poets are fools and that poetry is absurd . The second is that poetry is an agreeable after-dinner entertainment , and that a poet is great because he has written quotable lines . The last and worst is that which strives to press the poet into the service of some philosophical dogma , ism , or fad .</p>
    <p n="2">For these views the poets themselves , and no others , are largely responsible . With their exaggerated vanity , they have attempted to make of their craft a Masonic secret , iterating that a poet composes by ear alone ; that rhythm is not to be analyzed , that rhyme is sacrosanct ; that poets , by some special dispensation of Providence , write by inspiration , being born with more insight than other men ; and so forth . Is it any wonder that the public is indifferent , hostile , or befooled when poets themselves disdain to explain clearly what they are trying to do , and refuse to admit the public into the privacy of their carefully guarded workrooms ?</p>
    <p n="3">It was Theophile Gautier , I think , who offered to teach any one how to write poetry in twenty-five lessons . Now this view has in it some exaggeration , but , at the same time , much truth . No amount of lessoning will turn an idiot into a wise man , or enable a man to say something when he is naturally one who has nothing to say . Nevertheless , I believe that there would have been fewer mute inglorious Miltons , greater respect paid to poetry , and many better poets , if the poets themselves had stopped working through sheer instinct and set themselves the task of considering some elementary principles in their craft . In this belief , and in the hope of enlightening some one as to the aim and purpose of my work , I am writing this preface .</p>
    <p n="4">To begin with , the basis of English poetry is rhythm , or , as some would prefer to call it , cadence . This rhythm is obtained by mingling stressed and unstressed syllables . Stress may be produced by accent . It may — and often is — produced by what is known as quantity , the breath required to pronounce certain syllables being more than is required on certain others . However it be produced , it is precisely this insistence upon cadence , upon the rhythm of the line when spoken , which sets poetry apart from prose , and not — be it said at the outset — a certain way of printing , with a capital letter at the beginning of each line , or an insistence upon end-rhymes .</p>
    <p n="5">Now this rhythm can be made the same in every line of the poem . This was the aim of Alexander Pope , for instance . My objection to this method is that it is both artificial and unmusical . In the case of the eighteenth century men , it gave the effect of a perfectly balanced pattern , like a minuet or fugue . In the case of the modern imitator of Kipling or Masefield , it gives the effect of monotonous rag-time . In neither case does it offer full scope for emotional development .</p>
    <p n="6">I maintain that poetry is capable of as many gradations in cadence as music is in time . We can have a rapid group of syllables — what is called a line — succeeded by a slow heavy one ; like the swift , scurrying-up of the wave and the sullen dragging of itself away . Or we can gradually increase or decrease our tempo , creating accelerando and rallentando effects . Or we can follow a group of rapid lines with a group of slow ones , or a single slow , or vice versa . Finally , we can have a perfectly even and unaltered movement throughout if we desire to be monotonous .</p>
    <p n="7">The good poem is that in which all these effects are properly used to convey the underlying emotions of its author , and that which welds all these emotions into a work of art by the use of dominant motif , subordinate themes proportionate treatment , repetition , variation ,— what in music is called development , reversal of roles , and return In short , the good poem fixes a free emotion , or a free range of emotions , into an inevitable and artistic whole . The real secret of the greatest English poets lies not in their views on life ,— which were , naturally , only those which every sane man is obliged to hold ,— but in their profound knowledge of their craft , whereby they were enabled to put forth their views in perfect form . Each era of man has its unique and self-sufficing range of expression and experience , and therefore every poet must seek anew for himself , out of the language-medium at his disposal , rhythms which are adequate and forms which are expressive of his own unique personality .</p>
    <p n="8">As regards the length of the lines themselves , that depends altogether upon the apparatus which Nature has given us , to enable us to breathe and to speak . Each line of a poem , however many or few its stresses , represents a single breath , and therefore a single perception . The relation between breath and perception is a commonplace of Oriental philosophy . As we breathe so do we know the universe , whether by sudden , powerful gusts of inspiration , or through the calmer — but rarer — gradual ascent into the hidden mysteries of knowledge , and slow falling away therefrom into darkness .</p>
    <p n="9">So much for the question of metre . The second range of problems with which we are immediately concerned , when we examine the poetic craft , is that which is generally expressed under the name of rhyme .</p>
    <p n="10">Now rhyme is undoubtedly an element of poetry , but it is neither an indissoluble element , nor is it , in every case , an inevitable one . In the main , the instinct which makes for rhyme is sound . Poetry is an art which demands — though not invariably — the utmost richness and fulness of musical effect . When rhyme is considered as an additional instrument of what may be called the poetic orchestra , it both loses and gains in importance . It loses because it becomes of no greater import than assonance , consonance , alliteration , and a host of similar devices . It gains because it is used intelligently as a device for adding richness of effect , instead of blindly as a mere tag at the end of a line .</p>
    <p n="11">The system which demands that the end of every line of poetry must rhyme with the end of some one preceding or following it , has not even the merit of high antiquity or of civilized adherence . In its essence it is barbarous ; it derives from the stamping of feet , clapping of hands , pounding of drums , or like devices of savage peoples to mark the rhythms in their dances and songs . And its introduction into European poetry , as a rule to be invariably followed , dates precisely from the time of the break-up of the Latin civilization , and the approach of what the historians know as the Dark Ages . Since it has come into common use among European peoples , every poet of eminence has tried to avoid its fatiguing monotony , by constructing new stanza-forms . Dante , Petrarch , Chaucer , Spenser , all these were innovators or developers of what may be known as formal metre . But let us not forget that the greatest of all , Shakespeare , used rhyme in his plays , only as additional decoration to a lyric , or in a perfectly legitimate fashion as marking the necessary pause at the close of a scene . Let us also remember that , as he advanced in thought and expression , he gradually abandoned rhyme for the only reason that an artist abandons anything ; because it was no longer adequate .</p>
    <p n="12">The process that began with the Pervigilium Veneris , the mediaeval hymn-writers , and the Provencal troubadours , and which culminated in the orchestral blank verse of Shakespeare , has now passed through all the stages of reduction to formula , eclecticism , archaistic reaction , vulgarization , gramaphone popularity , and death . Milton — Gibbon among poets — reduced it to his too-monotonous organ-roll . Dryden , Pope and his followers , endlessly repeated a formula . Blake , Wordsworth , Coleridge , attempted a return to the Elizabethan and to the even earlier ballad forms . In the later nineteenth century we come back to still earlier forms . Ballades , rondeaus , even sestinas appear . Gradually we find the public attention dropping away from these juggling feats performed with stale form , and turning to what may be called the new balladist — the street singer who is content to doggerelize and make strident a once noble form . We have our Masefields , our Kiplings , and worse . Rag-time has at last made its appearance in poetry . Let us be grateful to the man who invented it — Nicholas Vachel Lindsay — but let us admit that the force of nature can no further go .</p>
    <p n="13">It is time to create something new . It is time to strip poetry of meaningless tatters of form , and to clothe her in new , suitable garments . Portents and precursors there have been in plenty . We already have Blake , Matthew Arnold , Whitman , Samuel Butler , and I know not how many more . Every one is talking — many poets , poeticules , and poetasters are writing — what they call “ free verse . ” Let there be no mistake about one thing . Free verse that is flabby , in-organic , shapelessly obvious , is as much of a crime against poetry as the cheapest echo of a Masefield that any doggerel scribbler ever strummed . Let poets drop their formulas — “ free ” or otherwise — and determine to discipline themselves through experiment . There is much to be learned from the precursors I have mentioned . There is a great deal to be learned from the French poets — Parnassians , Symbolists , Whitmanites , Fantaisistes — who have , in the years 1860 to 1900 , created a new Renaissance under our noses . But above all , what will teach us the most is our language and life . Never was life lived more richly , more fully , with more terrible blind intensity than it is being lived at this instant . Never was the noble language which is ours surpassed either in richness or in concision . We have the material with which to work , and the tools to do the work with . It is America 's opportunity to lay the foundations for a new flowering of English verse , and to lay them as broad as they are strong .</p>

      <l n="43">It seems to weave a dream of bubbles and flashing foam ,</l>
