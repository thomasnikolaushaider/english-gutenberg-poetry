   <head>DEDICATION</head>
   <p>When I began  The Song of the Stone Wall , Dr. Edward Everett Hale was still among us , and it was my intention to dedicate the poem to him if it should be deemed worthy of publication . I fancied that he would like it ; for he loved the old walls and the traditions that cling about them .</p>
   <p>As I tried to image the men who had built the walls long ago , it seemed to me that Dr. Hale was the living embodiment of whatever was heroic in the founders of New England . He was a great American . He was also a great Puritan . Was not the zeal of his ancestors upon his lips , and their courage in his heart ? Had they not bequeathed to him their torch-like faith , their patient fervor of toil and their creed of equality ?</p>
   <p>But his bright spirit had inherited no trace of their harshness and gloom . The windows of his soul opened to the sunlight of a joyous faith . His optimism and genial humor inspired gladness and good sense in others . With an old story he prepared their minds to receive new ideas , and with a parable he opened their hearts to generous feelings . All men loved him because he loved them . They knew that his heart was in their happiness , and that his humanity embraced their sorrows . In him the weak found a friend , the unprotected , a champion . Though a herald and proclaimer of peace , he could fight stubbornly and passionately on the side of justice . His was a lovable , uplifting greatness which drew all men near and ever nearer to God and to each other . Like his ancestors , he dreamed of a land of freedom founded on the love of God and the brotherhood of man , a land where each man shall achieve his share of happiness and learn the work of manhood  to rule himself and  lend a hand .</p>
   <p>Thoughts like these were often in my mind as the poem grew and took form . It is fitting , therefore , that I should dedicate it to him , and in so doing I give expression to the love and reverence which I have felt for him ever since he called me his little cousin , more than twenty years ago .</p>

     <l n="5">Come walk with me , and I will tell</l>
     <l n="6">What I have read in this scroll of stone ;</l>
     <l n="7">I will spell out this writing on hill and meadow .</l>
     <l n="8">It is a chronicle wrought by praying workmen ,</l>
     <l n="9">The forefathers of our nation —</l>
     <l n="10">Leagues upon leagues of sealed history awaiting an interpreter .</l>
     <l n="11">This is New England 's tapestry of stone</l>
     <l n="12">Alive with memories that throb and quiver</l>
     <l n="13">At the core of the ages</l>
     <l n="14">As the prophecies of old at the heart of God  s Word .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="15">The walls have many things to tell me ,</l>
     <l n="16">And the days are long . I come and listen :</l>
     <l n="17">My hand is upon the stones , and the tale I fain would hear</l>
     <l n="18">Is of the men who built the walls ,</l>
     <l n="19">And of the God who made the stones and the workers .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="20">With searching feet I walk beside the wall ;</l>
     <l n="21">I plunge and stumble over the fallen stones ;</l>
     <l n="22">I follow the windings of the wall</l>
     <l n="23">Over the heaving hill , down by the meadow-brook ,</l>
     <l n="24">Beyond the scented fields , by the marsh where rushes grow .</l>
     <l n="25">On I trudge through pine woods fragrant and cool</l>
     <l n="26">And emerge amid clustered pools and by rolling acres of rye .</l>
     <l n="27">The wall is builded of field-stones great and small ,</l>
     <l n="28">Tumbled about by frost and storm ,</l>
     <l n="29">Shaped and polished by ice and rain and sun ;</l>
     <l n="30">Some flattened , grooved , and chiseled</l>
     <l n="31">By the inscrutable sculpture of the weather ;</l>
     <l n="32">Some with clefts and rough edges harsh to the touch .</l>
     <l n="33">Gracious Time has glorified the wall</l>
     <l n="34">And covered the historian stones with a mantle of green .</l>
     <l n="35">Sunbeams flit and waver in the rifts ,</l>
     <l n="36">Vanish and reappear , linger and sleep ,</l>
     <l n="37">Conquer with radiance the obdurate angles ,</l>
     <l n="38">Filter between the naked rents and wind-bleached jags .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="39">I understand the triumph and the truth</l>
     <l n="40">Wrought into these walls of rugged stone .</l>
     <l n="41">They are a miracle of patient hands ,</l>
     <l n="42">They are a victory of suffering , a paean of pain ;</l>
     <l n="43">All pangs of death , all cries of birth ,</l>
     <l n="44">Are in the mute , moss-covered stones ;</l>
     <l n="45">They are eloquent to my hands .</l>
     <l n="46">O beautiful , blind stones , inarticulate and dumb !</l>
     <l n="47">In the deep gloom of their hearts there is a gleam</l>
     <l n="48">Of the primeval sun which looked upon them</l>
     <l n="49">When they were begotten .</l>
     <l n="50">So in the heart of man shines forever</l>
     <l n="51">A beam from the everlasting sun of God .</l>
     <l n="52">Rude and unresponsive are the stones ;</l>
     <l n="53">Yet in them divine things lie concealed ;</l>
     <l n="54">I hear their imprisoned chant :—</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="55">“ We are fragments of the universe ,</l>
     <l n="56">Chips of the rock whereon God laid the foundation of the world :</l>
     <l n="57">Out of immemorial chaos He wrought us .</l>
     <l n="58">Out of the sun , out of the tempest , out of the travail of the earth</l>
     <l n="59">we grew .</l>
     <l n="60">We are wonderfully mingled of life and death ;</l>
     <l n="61">We serve as crypts for innumerable , unnoticed , tiny forms .</l>
     <l n="62">We are manifestations of the Might</l>
     <l n="63">That rears the granite hills unto the clouds</l>
     <l n="64">And sows the tropic seas with coral isles .</l>
     <l n="65">We are shot through and through with hidden color ;</l>
     <l n="66">A thousand hues are blended in our gray substance .</l>
     <l n="67">Sapphire , turquoise , ruby , opal ,</l>
     <l n="68">Emerald , diamond , amethyst , are our sisters from the beginning ,</l>
     <l n="69">And our brothers are iron , lead , zinc ,</l>
     <l n="70">Copper and silver and gold .</l>
     <l n="71">We are the dust of continents past and to come ,</l>
     <l n="72">We are a deathless frieze carved with man 's destiny ;</l>
     <l n="73">In us is the record sibylline of far events .</l>
     <l n="74">We are as old as the world , our birth was before the hills .</l>
     <l n="75">We are the cup that holds the sea</l>
     <l n="76">And the framework of the peak that parts the sky .</l>
     <l n="77">When Chaos shall again return ,</l>
     <l n="78">And endless Night shall spread her wings upon a rained world ,</l>
     <l n="79">We alone shall stand up from the shattered earth ,</l>
     <l n="80">Indestructible , invincible witnesses of God  s eternal purpose .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="81">In reflective mood by the wall I wander ;</l>
     <l n="82">The hoary stones have set my heart astir ;</l>
     <l n="83">My thoughts take shape and move beside me in the guise</l>
     <l n="84">Of the stern men who built the wall in early olden days .</l>
     <l n="85">One by one the melancholy phantoms go stepping from me ,</l>
     <l n="86">And I follow them in and out among the stones .</l>
     <l n="87">I think of the days long gone ,</l>
     <l n="88">Flown like birds beyond the ramparts of the world .</l>
     <l n="89">The patient , sturdy men who piled the stones</l>
     <l n="90">Have vanished , like the days , beyond the bounds</l>
     <l n="91">Of earth and mortal things .</l>
     <l n="92">From their humble , steadfast lives has sprung the greatness of my</l>
     <l n="93">nation .</l>
     <l n="94">I am bone of their bone , breath of their breath ,</l>
     <l n="95">Their courage is in my soul .</l>
     <l n="96">The wall is an Iliad of granite : it chants to me</l>
     <l n="97">Of pilgrims of the perilous deep ,</l>
     <l n="98">Of fearless journeyings and old forgotten things .</l>
     <l n="99">The blood of grim ancestors warms the fingers</l>
     <l n="100">That trace the letters of their story ;</l>
     <l n="101">My pulses beat in unison with pulses that are stilled ;</l>
     <l n="102">The fire of their zeal inspires me</l>
     <l n="103">In my struggle with darkness and pain .</l>
     <l n="104">These embossed books , unobliterated by the tears and laughter</l>
     <l n="105">of Time ,</l>
     <l n="106">Are signed with the vital hands of undaunted men .</l>
     <l n="107">I love these monoliths , so crudely imprinted</l>
     <l n="108">With their stalwart , cleanly , frugal lives .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="109">From my seat among the stones I stretch my hand and touch</l>
     <l n="110">My friend the elm , urnlike , lithesome , tall .</l>
     <l n="111">Far above the reach of my exploring fingers</l>
     <l n="112">Birds are singing and winging joyously</l>
     <l n="113">Through leafy billows of green .</l>
     <l n="114">The elm-tree  s song is wondrous sweet ;</l>
     <l n="115">The words are the ancientest language of trees —</l>
     <l n="116">They tell of how earth and air and light</l>
     <l n="117">Are wrought anew to beauty and to fruitfulness .</l>
     <l n="118">I feel the glad stirrings under her rough bark ;</l>
     <l n="119">Her living sap mounts up to bring forth leaves ;</l>
     <l n="120">Her great limbs thrill beneath the wand of spring .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="121">This wall was builded in our fathers  days —</l>
     <l n="122">Valorous days when life was lusty and the land was new .</l>
     <l n="123">Resemble the walls the builders , buffeted , stern , and worn .</l>
     <l n="124">To us they left the law ,</l>
     <l n="125">Order , simplicity , obedience ,</l>
     <l n="126">And the wall is the bond they gave the nation</l>
     <l n="127">At its birth of courage and unflinching faith .</l>
     <l n="128">Before the epic here inscribed began ,</l>
     <l n="129">They wrote their course upon a trackless sea .</l>
     <l n="130">O , tiny craft , bearing a nation  s seed !</l>
     <l n="131">Frail shallop , quick with unborn states !</l>
     <l n="132">Autumn was mellow in the fatherland when they set sail ,</l>
     <l n="133">And winter deepened as they neared the West .</l>
     <l n="134">Out of the desert sea they came at last ,</l>
     <l n="135">And their hearts warmed to see that frozen land .</l>
     <l n="136">O , first gray dawn that filtered through the dark !</l>
     <l n="137">Bleak , glorious birth-hour of our northern states !</l>
     <l n="138">They stood upon the shore like new created men ;</l>
     <l n="139">On barren solitudes of sand they stood ,</l>
     <l n="140">The conquered sea behind , the unconquered wilderness before .</l>
     <l n="141">Some died that year beneath the cruel cold ,</l>
     <l n="142">And some for heartsick longing and the pang</l>
     <l n="143">Of homes remembered and souls torn asunder .</l>
     <l n="144">That spring the new-plowed field for bread of life</l>
     <l n="145">Bordered the new-dug acre marked for death ;</l>
     <l n="146">Beside the springing corn they laid in the sweet , dark earth</l>
     <l n="147">The young man , strong and free , the maiden fair and trustful ,</l>
     <l n="148">The little child , and the uncomplaining mother .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="149">Across the meadow , by the ancient pines ,</l>
     <l n="150">Where I , the child of life that lived that spring ,</l>
     <l n="151">Drink in the fragrances of the young year ,</l>
     <l n="152">The field-wall meets one grimly squared and straight .</l>
     <l n="153">Beyond it rise the old tombs , gray and restful ,</l>
     <l n="154">And the upright slates record the generations .</l>
     <l n="155">Stiffly aslant before the northern blasts ,</l>
     <l n="156">Like the steadfast , angular beliefs</l>
     <l n="157">Of those whom they commemorate , the headstones stand ,</l>
     <l n="158">Cemented deep with moss and invisible roots .</l>
     <l n="159">The rude inscriptions charged with faith and love ,</l>
     <l n="160">Graceless as Death himself , yet sweet as Death ,</l>
     <l n="161">Are half erased by the impartial storms .</l>
     <l n="162">As children lisping words which move to laughter</l>
     <l n="163">Are themselves poems of unconscious melody ,</l>
     <l n="164">So the old gravestones with their crabbed muse</l>
     <l n="165">Are beautiful for their halting words of faith ,</l>
     <l n="166">Their groping love that had no gift of song .</l>
     <l n="167">But all the broken tragedy of life</l>
     <l n="168">And all the yearning mystery of death</l>
     <l n="169">Are celebrated in sweet epitaphs of vines and violets .</l>
     <l n="170">Close by the wall a peristyle of pines</l>
     <l n="171">Sings requiem to all the dead that sleep .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="172">Beyond the village churchyard , still and calm ,</l>
     <l n="173">Steeped in the sweetness of eternal morn ,</l>
     <l n="174">The wall runs down in crumbling cadence</l>
     <l n="175">Beside the brook which plays</l>
     <l n="176">Through the land like a silver harp .</l>
     <l n="177">A wind of ancient romance blows across the field ,</l>
     <l n="178">A sweet disturbance thrills the air ;</l>
     <l n="179">The silken skirts of Spring go rustling by ,</l>
     <l n="180">And the earth is astir with joy .</l>
     <l n="181">Up the hill , romping and shaking their golden heads ,</l>
     <l n="182">Come the little children of the wood .</l>
     <l n="183">From ecstasy to ecstasy the year mounts upward .</l>
     <l n="184">Up from the south come the odor-laden winds ,</l>
     <l n="185">Angels and ministers of life ,</l>
     <l n="186">Dropping seeds of fruitfulness</l>
     <l n="187">Into the bosoms of flowers .</l>
     <l n="188">Elusive , alluring secrets hide in wood and hedge</l>
     <l n="189">Like the first thoughts of love</l>
     <l n="190">In the breast of a maiden ;</l>
     <l n="191">The witchery of love is in rock and tree .</l>
     <l n="192">Across the pasture , star-sown with daisies ,</l>
     <l n="193">I see a young girl — the spirit of spring she seems ,</l>
     <l n="194">Sister of the winds that run through the rippling daisies .</l>
     <l n="195">Sweet and clear her voice calls father and brother ,</l>
     <l n="196">And one whose name her shy lips will not utter .</l>
     <l n="197">But a chorus of leaves and grasses speaks her heart</l>
     <l n="198">And tells his name : the birches flutter by the wall ;</l>
     <l n="199">The wild cherry-tree shakes its plumy head</l>
     <l n="200">And whispers his name ; the maple</l>
     <l n="201">Opens its rosy lips and murmurs his name ;</l>
     <l n="202">The marsh-marigold sends the rumor</l>
     <l n="203">Down the winding stream , and the blue flag</l>
     <l n="204">Spread the gossip to the lilies in the lake :</l>
     <l n="205">All Nature  s eyes and tongues conspire</l>
     <l n="206">In the unfolding of the tale</l>
     <l n="207">That Adam and Eve beneath the blossoming rose-tree</l>
     <l n="208">Told each other in the Garden of Eden .</l>
     <l n="209">Once more the wind blows from the walls ,</l>
     <l n="210">And I behold a fair young mother ;</l>
     <l n="211">She stands at the lilac-shaded door</l>
     <l n="212">With her baby at her breast ;</l>
     <l n="213">She looks across the twilit fields and smiles</l>
     <l n="214">And whispers to her child :  Thy father comes !</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="215">Life triumphed over many-weaponed Death .</l>
     <l n="216">Sorrow and toil and the wilderness thwarted their stout invasion ;</l>
     <l n="217">But with the ship that sailed again went no retreating soul !</l>
     <l n="218">Stubborn , unvanquished , clinging to the skirts of Hope ,</l>
     <l n="219">They kept their narrow foothold on the land ,</l>
     <l n="220">And the ship sailed home for more .</l>
     <l n="221">With yearlong striving they fought their way into the forest ;</l>
     <l n="222">Their axes echoed where I sit , a score of miles from the sea .</l>
     <l n="223">Slowly , slowly the wilderness yielded</l>
     <l n="224">To smiling grass-plots and clearings of yellow corn ;</l>
     <l n="225">And while the logs of their cabins were still moist</l>
     <l n="226">With odorous sap , they set upon the hill</l>
     <l n="227">The shrine of liberty for man  s mind ,</l>
     <l n="228">And by it the shrine of liberty for man  s soul ,</l>

     <l n="230">The apple-tree by the wall sheds its blossom about me —</l>
     <l n="231">A shower of petals of light upon darkness .</l>
     <l n="232">From Nature  s brimming cup I drink a thousand scents ;</l>
     <l n="233">At noon the wizard sun stirs the hot soil under the pines .</l>
     <l n="234">I take the top stone of the wall in my hands</l>
     <l n="235">And the sun in my heart ;</l>
