       <l n="1">The Carlyles</l>
     </lg>
     <p>[ I was talking with a newspaper man the other day who seemed to think that the fact that Mrs. Carlyle threw a teacup at Mr. Carlyle should be given to the public merely as a fact .</p>
     <p>But a fact presented to people without the proper — or even , if necessary , without the improper — human being to go with it does not mean anything and does not really become alive or caper about in people 's minds .</p>
     <p>But what I want and what I believe most people want when a fact is being presented is one or two touches that will make natural and human questions rise in and play about like this :</p>
     <p>“ Did a servant see Mrs. Carlyle throw the teacup ? Was the servant an English servant with an English imagination or an Irish servant with an Irish imagination ? What would the fact have been like if Mr. Browning had been listening at the keyhole ? Or Oscar Wilde , or Punch , or the Missionary Herald , or The New York Sun , or the Christian Science Monitor ? ” — GERALD STANLEY LEE in the Satevepost . ]</p>

      <head>BY OUR OWN ROBERT BROWNING</head>
       <l n="1">As a poet heart - and fancy-free — whole ,</l>
       <l n="2">I listened at the Carlyles ’ keyhole ;</l>
       <l n="3">And I saw , I , Robert Browning , saw ,</l>
       <l n="4">Tom hurl a teacup at Jane 's jaw .</l>
       <l n="5">She silent sat , nor tried to speak up</l>
       <l n="6">When came the wallop with the teacup —</l>
       <l n="7">A cup not filled with Beaune or Clicquot ,</l>
       <l n="8">But one that brimmed with Orange Pekoe .</l>

       <l n="1">[ Exit Lady Leffingwell ]</l>
     </lg>
     <p>FROM OUR OWN “ PUNCH ”</p>
     <p>A MANCHESTER autograph collector , we are informed , has just offered £ 50 for the signature of Tea Carlyle .</p>
     <p>FROM OUR OWN “ MISSIONARY HERALD ”</p>
     <p>From what clouds cannot sunshine be distilled ! When , in a fit of godless rage , Mr. Carlyle threw a teacup at the good woman he had vowed at the altar to love , honour , and obey , she smiled and the thought of China entered her head .</p>
     <p>Yesterday Mrs. Carlyle enrolled as a missionary , and will sail for the benighted land of the heathen to-morrow .</p>
     <p>FROM OUR OWN “ NEW YORK SUN ”</p>
     <p>Fortunate is MRS. JANE WELSH CARLYLE to have escaped with her life , though if she had not , no American worthy of the traditions of Washington could simulate acute sorrow . MR. CARLYLE , wearied of the dilatory methods of the BAKERIAN War Department , properly took the law into his own strong hands .</p>
     <p>The argument that resulted in the teacup 's leaving MR. CARLYLE 'S hands was common in most households . It transpires that MRS. CARLYLE , with a Bolshevistic tendency that makes patriots wonder what the Department of Justice — to borrow a phrase from a newspaper cartoonist — thinks about , had been championing the British-Wilson League of Nations , that league which will make ironically true our “ E Pluribus Unum ” — one of many . Repeated efforts by MR. CARLYLE , in appeals to the Department of Justice , the Military Intelligence Division , and the City Government , were of no avail . And so MR. CARLYLE , like the red-blooded American he is , did what the authorities should have saved him the embarrassing trouble of doing .</p>
     <lg type="poem">
      <head>FROM OUR OWN “ CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR ”</head>
      <head>It is reported that Mr. Thomas Carlyle has thrown a teacup at Mrs. Carlyle , and much exaggerated and acrid comment has been made on this incident .</head>
      <head>If it had been a whiskey glass , or a cocktail glass , the results might have been fatal . In Oregon , which went dry in 1916 , the number of women hit by crockery has decreased 4. 2 per cent in three years . Of 1 , 844 women in Oregon hit by crockery in 1915 , 1 , 802 were hit by glasses containing , or destined to contain , alcoholic stimulants . More than 94 per cent of these accidents resulted fatally . The remaining 22 women , hit by tea or coffee cups , are now happy , useful members of society .</head>

     <p>“ Bee ” Palmer has taken the raw , human — all too human — stuff of the underworld , with its sighs of sadness and regret , its mad merriment , its swift blaze of passion , its turbulent dances , its outlaw music , its songs of the social bandit , and made a new art product of the theatre . She is to the sources of jazz and the blues what François Villon was to the wild life of Paris . Both have found exquisite blossoms of art in the sector of life most removed from the concert room and the boudoir , and their harvest has the vigour , the resolute life , the stimulating quality , the indelible impress of daredevil , care-free , do-as-you-please lives of the picturesque men and women who defy convention .— From Keith 's Press Agent .</p>

       <l n="3">Notably fond of music , I dote on a clearer tone</l>
       <l n="4">Than ever was blared by a bugle or zoomed by a saxophone ;</l>
       <l n="5">And the sound that opens the gates for me of a Paradise revealed</l>
       <l n="6">Is something akin to the note revered by the blesséd Eugene Field ,</l>
       <l n="7">Who sang in pellucid phrasing that I perfectly well recall</l>
       <l n="8">Of the clink of the ice in the pitcher that the boy brings up the hall .</l>
       <l n="9">But sweeter to me than the sparrow 's song or the goose 's autumn honks</l>
       <l n="10">Is the sound of the ice in the shaker as the barkeeper mixes a Bronx .</l>

       <l n="11">Between the dark and the daylight , when I 'm worried about The Tower ,</l>

       <l n="13">hour ;</l>
       <l n="14">And my soul is sad and jaded , and my heart is a thing forlorn ,</l>
       <l n="15">And I view the things I have written with a sickening , scathing scorn .</l>
       <l n="16">Oh , it 's then I fare with some other slave who is hired for the things</l>
       <l n="17">he writes</l>
       <l n="18">To a Den of Sin where they mingle gin — such as Lipton 's , Mouquin 's , or</l>

       <l n="20">And my spirit thrills to a music sweeter than Sullivan or Puccini —</l>
       <l n="21">The swash of the ice in the shaker as he mixes a Dry Martini .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="22">The drys will assert that metallic sound is the selfsame canon made</l>
       <l n="23">By the ice in the shaker that holds a drink like orange or lemonade ;</l>
       <l n="24">But on the word of a travelled man and a bard who has been around ,</l>
       <l n="25">The sound of tin on ice and gin is a snappier , happier sound .</l>
       <l n="26">And I mean to hymn , as soon as I have a moment of leisure time ,</l>
       <l n="27">The chill susurrus of cocktail ice in an adequate piece of rhyme .</l>
       <l n="28">But I 've just had an invitation to hark , at a beckoning bar ,</l>
       <l n="29">To the sound of the ice in the shaker as the barkeeper mixes a Star .</l>

     <p>Annabel L. Poe , of 1834-1 / 2 3rd Av ., the beautiful young fiancee of Edmund Allyn Poe , a magazine writer from the South , was found dead early this morning on the beach off E. 8th St .</p>
     <p>Poe seemed prostrated and , questioned by the police , said that one of her aristocratic relatives had taken her to the “ seashore , ” but that the cold winds had given her “ flu , ” from which she never “ rallied . ”</p>
     <p>Detectives at work on the case believe , they say , that there was a suicide compact between the Poes and that Poe also intended to do away with himself .</p>
     <p>He refused to leave the spot where the woman 's body had been found .</p>

     <p>( By Cable to The Courier )</p>
     <p>HUDDERSFIELD , KENT , ENGLAND .— Jan . 15 .— Swinging far out above the city , “ Bessie ” Smith , the young and beautiful fiancée of Basil Underwood , a prisoner incarcerated in the town jail , saved his life to-night .</p>
     <p>The woman went to “ Jack ” Hemingway , sexton of the First M. E. Church , and asked him to refrain from ringing the curfew bell last night , as Underwood 's execution had been set for the hour when the bell was to ring . Hemingway refused , alleging it to be his duty to ring the bell .</p>
     <p>With a quick step Miss Smith bounded forward , sprang within the old church door , left the old man threading slowly paths which previously he had trodden , and mounted up to the tower . Climbing the dusty ladder in the dark , she is said to have whispered :</p>
     <p>“ Curfew is not to ring this evening . ”</p>
     <p>Seizing the heavy tongue of the bell , as it was about to move , she swung far out suspended in mid-air , oscillating , thus preventing the bell from ringing . Hemingway 's deafness prevented him from hearing the bell ring , but as he had been deaf for 20 years , he attributed no importance to the silence .</p>
     <p>As Miss Smith descended , she met Oliver Cromwell , the well-known lord protector , who had condemned Underwood to death . Hearing her story and noting her hands , bruised and torn , he said in part : “ Go , your lover lives . Curfew shall not ring this evening . ”</p>

     <p>BOSTON , MASS , Jan. 17 — Cheered by the faith of little “ Jennie ” Carpenter , the 7-year-old daughter of Capt . B. L. Carpenter , of a steamer whose name could not be learned , 117 passengers on board were brought through panic early this morning while the storm was at its height , to shore .</p>
     <p>George H. Nebich , one of the passengers , told the following story to a COURIER reporter :</p>
     <p>“ About midnight we were crowded in the cabin , afraid to sleep on account of the storm . All were praying , as Capt . Carpenter , staggering down the stairs , cried : ‘ We are lost ! ’ It was then that little ‘ Jennie , ’ his daughter , took him by his hand and asked him whether he did not believe in divine omnipresence . All the passengers kissed the little ‘ girlie ’ whose faith had so inspirited us . ”</p>
     <p>The steamer , it was said at the office of the company owning her , would leave as usual to-night for Portland .</p>

     <p>SAN FRANCISCO , Aug . 3 .— Francis B. Harte and E. W. Nye , a pair of local magazine writers , lost what is believed to be a large sum of money in a game of euchre played near the Bar-M mine this afternoon .</p>
     <p>There had been , Harte alleged , a three-handed game of euchre participated in by Nye , a Chinaman named Ah Sin and himself . The Chinaman , Harte asserted , did not understand the game , but , Harte declared , smiled as he sat by the table with what Harte termed was a “ smile that was childlike and bland . ”</p>
     <p>Harte said that his feelings were shocked by the chicanery of Nye , but that the hands held by Ah Sin were unusual . Nye , maddened by the Chinaman 's trickery , rushed at him , 24 packs of cards spilling from the tong-man 's long sleeves . On his taper nails was found some wax .</p>
     <p>The “ Mongolian , ” Harte said , is peculiar .</p>
     <p>Harte and Nye are thought to have lost a vast sum of money , as they are wealthy authors .</p>
