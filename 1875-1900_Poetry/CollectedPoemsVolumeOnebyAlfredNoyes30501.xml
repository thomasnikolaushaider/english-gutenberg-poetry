    <docTitle><titlePart>THE LOOM OF YEARS In the light of the silent stars that shine on the struggling sea , In the weary cry of the wind and the whisper of flower and tree , Under the breath of laughter , deep in the tide of tears , I hear the Loom of the Weaver that weaves the Web of Years . The leaves of the winter wither and sink in the forest mould To colour the flowers of April with purple and white and gold : Light and scent and music die and are born again In the heart of a grey-haired woman who wakes in a world of pain . The hound , the fawn and the hawk , and the doves that croon and coo , We are all one woof of the weaving and the one warp threads us through , One flying cloud on the shuttle that carries our hopes and fears As it goes thro ’ the Loom of the Weaver that weaves the Web of Years . The crosiers of the fern , and the crown , the crown of the rose , Pass with our hearts to the Silence where the wings of music close , Pass and pass to the Timeless that never a moment mars , Pass and pass to the Darkness that made the suns and stars . Has the soul gone out in the Darkness ? Is the dust sealed from sight ? Ah , hush , for the woof of the ages returns thro ’ the warp of the night ! Never that shuttle loses one thread of our hopes and fears , As It comes thro ’ the Loom of the Weaver that weaves the Web of Years . O , woven in one wide Loom thro ’ the throbbing weft of the whole , One in spirit and flesh , one in body and soul , The leaf on the winds of autumn , the bird in its hour to die , The heart in its muffled anguish , the sea in its mournful cry , One with the flower of a day , one with the withered moon , One with the granite mountains that melt into the noon , One with the dream that triumphs beyond the light of the spheres , We come from the Loom of the Weaver that weaves the Web of Years .</titlePart></docTitle>

     <l n="22">Or the spray of the foam-bow rustles in the white dawn of the moon ,</l>
     <l n="23">And mournful billows moan aloud , Come soon , soon , soon ,</l>

      <l n="56">The wind may beat upon us , the rain may blind our eyes ,</l>

      <l n="58">But we shall hear the music of the dream that never dies ,</l>
      <l n="59">And we shall know the secret of the Spring .</l>
      <l n="60">We shall know how all the blossoms of evil and of good</l>
      <l n="61">Are mingled in the meadows of the sky ;</l>
      <l n="62">And then — if Death can find us in the heart of the wood —</l>

     <l n="1">With rosy finger-tips the Dawn</l>
     <l n="2">Drew back the silver veils ,</l>
     <l n="3">Till lilac shimmered into lawn</l>
     <l n="4">Above the satin sails ;</l>
     <l n="5">And o'er the waters , white and wan ,</l>
     <l n="6">In tiny patterned state ,</l>
     <l n="7">We saw the streets of Old Japan</l>
     <l n="8">Shine , like a willow plate .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">O , many a milk-white pigeon roams</l>
     <l n="10">The purple cherry crops ,</l>
     <l n="11">The mottled miles of pearly domes ,</l>
     <l n="12">And blue pagoda tops ,</l>
     <l n="13">The river with its golden canes</l>
     <l n="14">And dark piratic dhows ,</l>
     <l n="15">To where beyond the twisting vanes</l>
     <l n="16">The burning mountain glows .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="17">A snow-peak in the silver skies</l>
     <l n="18">Beyond that magic world ,</l>
     <l n="19">We saw the great volcano rise</l>
     <l n="20">With incense o'er it curled ,</l>
     <l n="21">Whose tiny thread of rose and blue</l>
     <l n="22">Has risen since time began ,</l>
     <l n="23">Before the first enchanter knew</l>
     <l n="24">The peak of Old Japan .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="25">Nobody watched us quietly steer</l>
     <l n="26">The pinnace to the painted pier ,</l>
     <l n="27">Except one pig-tailed mandarin ,</l>
     <l n="28">Who sat upon a chest of tea</l>
     <l n="29">Pretending not to hear or see !...</l>
     <l n="30">His hands were very long and thin ,</l>
     <l n="31">His face was very broad and white ;</l>
     <l n="32">And O , it was a fearful sight</l>
     <l n="33">To see him sit alone and grin !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="34">His grin was very sleek and sly :</l>
     <l n="35">Timidly we passed him by .</l>
     <l n="36">He did not seem at all to care :</l>
     <l n="37">So , thinking we were safely past ,</l>
     <l n="38">We ventured to look back at last .</l>
     <l n="39">O , dreadful blank !— He was not there !</l>
     <l n="40">He must have hid behind his chest :</l>
     <l n="41">We did not stay to see the rest .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="42">But , as in reckless haste we ran ,</l>
     <l n="43">We came upon the tall thin man ,</l>
     <l n="44">Who called to us and waved his fan ,</l>
     <l n="45">And offered us his palanquin :</l>
     <l n="46">He said we must not go alone</l>
     <l n="47">To seek the ruby wishing-stone ,</l>
     <l n="48">Because the white-faced mandarin</l>
     <l n="49">Would dog our steps for many a mile ,</l>
     <l n="50">And sit upon each purple stile</l>
     <l n="51">Before we came to it , and smile</l>
     <l n="52">And smile ; his name was Creeping Sin .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="53">He played with children 's beating hearts ,</l>
     <l n="54">And stuck them full of poisoned darts</l>
     <l n="55">And long green thorns that stabbed and stung :</l>
     <l n="56">He 'd watch until we tried to speak ,</l>
     <l n="57">Then thrust inside his pasty cheek</l>
     <l n="58">His long , white , slimy tongue :</l>
     <l n="59">And smile at everything we said ;</l>
     <l n="60">And sometimes pat us on the head ,</l>
     <l n="61">And say that we were very young :</l>
     <l n="62">He was a cousin of the man</l>
     <l n="63">Who said that there was no Japan .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="64">And night and day this Creeping Sin</l>
     <l n="65">Would follow the path of the palanquin ;</l>
     <l n="66">Yet if we still were fain to touch</l>
     <l n="67">The ruby , we must have no fear ,</l>
     <l n="68">Whatever we might see or hear ,</l>
     <l n="69">And the tall thin man would take us there ;</l>
     <l n="70">He did not fear that Sly One much ,</l>
     <l n="71">Except perhaps on a moonless night ,</l>
     <l n="72">Nor even then if the stars were bright .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="73">So , in the yellow palankeen</l>
     <l n="74">We swung along in state between</l>
     <l n="75">Twinkling domes of gold and green</l>
     <l n="76">Through the rich bazaar ,</l>
     <l n="77">Where the cross-legged merchants sat ,</l>
     <l n="78">Old and almond-eyed and fat ,</l>
     <l n="79">Each upon a gorgeous mat ,</l>
     <l n="80">Each in a cymar ;</l>
     <l n="81">Each in crimson samite breeches ,</l>
     <l n="82">Watching his barbaric riches .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="83">Cherry blossom breathing sweet</l>
     <l n="84">Whispered o'er the dim blue street</l>
     <l n="85">Where with fierce uncertain feet</l>
     <l n="86">Tawny pirates walk :</l>
     <l n="87">All in belts and baggy blouses ,</l>
     <l n="88">Out of dreadful opium houses ,</l>
     <l n="89">Out of dens where Death carouses ,</l>
     <l n="90">Horribly they stalk ;</l>
     <l n="91">Girt with ataghan and dagger ,</l>
     <l n="92">Right across the road they swagger .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="93">And where the cherry orchards blow ,</l>
     <l n="94">We saw the maids of Miyako ,</l>
     <l n="95">Swaying softly to and fro</l>
     <l n="96">Through the dimness of the dance :</l>
     <l n="97">Like sweet thoughts that shine through dreams</l>
     <l n="98">They glided , wreathing rosy gleams ,</l>
     <l n="99">With stately sounds of silken streams ,</l>
     <l n="100">And many a slim kohl-lidded glance ;</l>
     <l n="101">Then fluttered with tiny rose-bud feet</l>
     <l n="102">To a soft frou-frou and a rhythmic beat</l>
     <l n="103">As the music shimmered , pursuit , retreat ,</l>
     <l n="104">“ Hands across , retire , advance ! ”</l>
     <l n="105">And again it changed and the glimmering throng</l>
     <l n="106">Faded into a distant song .</l>
    </lg>
    <p>SONG</p>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="107">The maidens of Miyako</l>
     <l n="108">Dance in the sunset hours ,</l>
     <l n="109">Deep in the sunset glow ,</l>
     <l n="110">Under the cherry flowers .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="111">With dreamy hands of pearl</l>
     <l n="112">Floating like butterflies ,</l>
     <l n="113">Dimly the dancers whirl</l>
     <l n="114">As the rose-light dies ;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="115">And their floating gowns , their hair</l>
     <l n="116">Upbound with curious pins ,</l>
     <l n="117">Fade thro ’ the darkening air</l>
     <l n="118">With the dancing mandarins .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="119">And then , as we went , the tall thin man</l>
     <l n="120">Explained the manners of Old Japan ;</l>
     <l n="121">If you pitied a thing , you pretended to sneer ;</l>
     <l n="122">Yet if you were glad you ran to buy</l>
     <l n="123">A captive pigeon and let it fly ;</l>
     <l n="124">And , if you were sad , you took a spear</l>
     <l n="125">To wound yourself , for fear your pain</l>
     <l n="126">Should quietly grow less again .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="127">And , again he said , if we wished to find</l>
     <l n="128">The mystic City that enshrined</l>
     <l n="129">The stone so few on earth had found ,</l>
     <l n="130">We must be very brave ; it lay</l>
     <l n="131">A hundred haunted leagues away ,</l>
     <l n="132">Past many a griffon-guarded ground ,</l>
     <l n="133">In depths of dark and curious art ,</l>
     <l n="134">Where passion-flowers enfold apart</l>
     <l n="135">The Temple of the Flaming Heart ,</l>
     <l n="136">The City of the Secret Wound .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="137">About the fragrant fall of day</l>
     <l n="138">We saw beside the twisted way</l>
     <l n="139">A blue-domed tea-house , bossed with gold ;</l>
     <l n="140">Hungry and thirsty we entered in ,</l>
     <l n="141">How should we know what Creeping Sin</l>
     <l n="142">Had breathed in that Emperor 's ear who sold</l>
     <l n="143">His own dumb soul for an evil jewel</l>
     <l n="144">To the earth-gods , blind and ugly and cruel ?</l>
     <l n="145">We drank sweet tea as his tale was told ,</l>
     <l n="146">In a garden of blue chrysanthemums ,</l>
     <l n="147">While a drowsy swarming of gongs and drums</l>
     <l n="148">Out of the sunset dreamily rolled .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="149">But , as the murmur nearer drew ,</l>
     <l n="150">A fat black bonze , in a robe of blue ,</l>
     <l n="151">Suddenly at the gate appeared ;</l>
     <l n="152">And close behind , with that evil grin ,</l>
     <l n="153">Was it Creeping Sin , was it Creeping Sin ?</l>
     <l n="154">The bonze looked quietly down and sneered .</l>
     <l n="155">Our guide ! Was he sleeping ? We could not wake him .</l>
     <l n="156">However we tried to pinch and shake him !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="19">
     <l n="157">Nearer , nearer the tumult came ,</l>
     <l n="158">Till , as a glare of sound and flame ,</l>
     <l n="159">Blind from a terrible furnace door</l>
     <l n="160">Blares , or the mouth of a dragon , blazed</l>
     <l n="161">The seething gateway : deaf and dazed</l>
     <l n="162">With the clanging and the wild uproar</l>
     <l n="163">We stood ; while a thousand oval eyes</l>
     <l n="164">Gapped our fear with a sick surmise .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="20">
     <l n="165">Then , as the dead sea parted asunder ,</l>
     <l n="166">The clamour clove with a sound of thunder</l>
     <l n="167">In two great billows ; and all was quiet .</l>
     <l n="168">Gaunt and black was the palankeen</l>
     <l n="169">That came in dreadful state between</l>
     <l n="170">The frozen waves of the wild-eyed riot</l>
     <l n="171">Curling back from the breathless track</l>
     <l n="172">Of the Nameless One who is never seen :</l>
     <l n="173">The close drawn curtains were thick and black ;</l>
     <l n="174">But wizen and white was the tall thin man</l>
     <l n="175">As he rose in his sleep :</l>
     <l n="176">His eyes were closed , his lips were wan ,</l>
     <l n="177">He crouched like a leopard that dares not leap .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="21">
     <l n="178">The bearers halted : the tall thin man ,</l>
     <l n="179">Fearfully dreaming , waved his fan ,</l>
     <l n="180">With wizard fingers , to and fro ;</l>
     <l n="181">While , with a whimper of evil glee ,</l>
     <l n="182">The Nameless Emperor 's mad Moonshee</l>
     <l n="183">Stepped in front of us : dark and slow</l>
     <l n="184">Were the words of the doom that he dared not name ;</l>
     <l n="185">But , over the ground , as he spoke there came</l>
     <l n="186">Tiny circles of soft blue flame ;</l>
     <l n="187">Like ghosts of flowers they began to glow ,</l>
     <l n="188">And flow like a moonlit brook between</l>
     <l n="189">Our feet and the terrible palankeen .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="22">
     <l n="190">But the Moonshee wrinkled his long thin eyes ,</l>
     <l n="191">And sneered , “ Have you stolen the strength of the skies ?</l>
     <l n="192">Then pour before us a stream of pearl !</l>
     <l n="193">Give us the pearl and the gold we know ,</l>
     <l n="194">And our hearts will be softened and let you go ;</l>
     <l n="195">But these are toys for a foolish girl —</l>

     <l n="126">As if a witch 's cauldron boiled ;</l>
     <l n="127">All round the door great serpents coiled ,</l>
     <l n="128">With eyes of glowing amethyst ,</l>

    <head>THE SPLENDID SECRET</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Now father stood engaged in talk</l>
     <l n="2">With mother on that narrow walk</l>
     <l n="3">Between the laurels ( where we play</l>
     <l n="4">At Red-skins lurking for their prey )</l>
     <l n="5">And the grey old wall of roses</l>
     <l n="6">Where the Persian kitten dozes</l>
     <l n="7">And the sunlight sleeps upon</l>
     <l n="8">Crannies of the crumbling stone</l>
     <l n="9">— So hot it is you scarce can bear</l>
     <l n="10">Your naked hand upon it there ,</l>
     <l n="11">Though there luxuriating in heat</l>
     <l n="12">With a slow and gorgeous beat</l>
     <l n="13">White-winged currant-moths display</l>
     <l n="14">Their spots of black and gold all day .—</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="15">Well , since we greatly wished to know</l>
     <l n="16">Whether we too might some day go</l>
     <l n="17">Where little Peterkin had gone</l>
     <l n="18">Without one word and all alone ,</l>
     <l n="19">We crept up through the laurels there</l>
     <l n="20">Hoping that we might overhear</l>
     <l n="21">The splendid secret , darkly great ,</l>
     <l n="22">Of Peterkin 's mysterious fate ;</l>
     <l n="23">And on what high adventure bound</l>
     <l n="24">He left our pleasant garden-ground ,</l>
     <l n="25">Whether for old Japan once more</l>
     <l n="26">He voyaged from the dim blue shore ,</l>
     <l n="27">Or whether he set out to run</l>
     <l n="28">By candle-light to Babylon .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="29">We just missed something father said</l>
     <l n="30">About a young prince that was dead ,</l>
     <l n="31">A little warrior that had fought</l>
     <l n="32">And failed : how hopes were brought to nought</l>
     <l n="33">He said , and mortals made to bow</l>
     <l n="34">Before the Juggernaut of Death ,</l>
     <l n="35">And all the world was darker now ,</l>
     <l n="36">For Time 's grey lips and icy breath</l>
     <l n="37">Had blown out all the enchanted lights</l>
     <l n="38">That burned in Love 's Arabian nights ;</l>
     <l n="39">And now he could not understand</l>
     <l n="40">Mother 's mystic fairy-land ,</l>
     <l n="41">“ Land of the dead , poor fairy-tale , ”</l>
     <l n="42">He murmured , and her face grew pale ,</l>
     <l n="43">And then with great soft shining eyes</l>
     <l n="44">She leant to him — she looked so wise —</l>
     <l n="45">And , with her cheek against his cheek ,</l>
     <l n="46">We heard her , ah so softly , speak .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="47">“ Husband , there was a happy day ,</l>
     <l n="48">Long ago , in love 's young May ,</l>
     <l n="49">When with a wild-flower in your hand</l>
     <l n="50">You echoed that dead poet 's cry —</l>
     <l n="51">‘ Little flower , but if I could understand ! ’</l>
     <l n="52">And you saw it had roots in the depths of the sky ,</l>
     <l n="53">And there in that smallest bud lay furled</l>
     <l n="54">The secret and meaning of all the world . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="55">He shook his head and then he tried</l>
     <l n="56">To kiss her , but she only cried</l>
     <l n="57">And turned her face away and said ,</l>
     <l n="58">“ You come between me and my dead !</l>
     <l n="59">His soul is near me , night and day ,</l>
     <l n="60">But you would drive it far away ;</l>
     <l n="61">And you shall never kiss me now</l>
     <l n="62">Until you lift that brave old brow</l>
     <l n="63">Of faith I know so well ; or else</l>
     <l n="64">Refute the tale the skylark tells ,</l>
     <l n="65">Tarnish the glory of that May ,</l>
     <l n="66">Explain the Smallest Flower away . ”</l>
     <l n="67">And still he said , “ Poor fairy-tales ,</l>
     <l n="68">How terribly their starlight pales</l>
     <l n="69">Before the solemn sun of truth</l>
     <l n="70">That rises o'er the grave of youth ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="71">“ Is heaven a fairy-tale ? ” she said ,—</l>
     <l n="72">And once again he shook his head ;</l>
     <l n="73">And yet we ne'er could understand</l>
     <l n="74">Why heaven should not be fairy-land ,</l>
     <l n="75">A part of heaven at least , and why</l>
     <l n="76">The thought of it made mother cry ,</l>
     <l n="77">And why they went away so sad ,</l>
     <l n="78">And father still quite unforgiven ,</l>
     <l n="79">For what could children be but glad</l>
     <l n="80">To find a fairy-land in heaven ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="81">And as we talked it o'er we found</l>
     <l n="82">Our brains were really spinning round ;</l>
     <l n="83">But Dick , our eldest , late returned</l>
     <l n="84">From school , by all the lore he 'd learned</l>
     <l n="85">Declared that we should seek the lost</l>
     <l n="86">Smallest Flower at any cost .</l>
     <l n="87">For , since within its leaves lay furled</l>
     <l n="88">The secret of the whole wide world ,</l>
     <l n="89">He thought that we might learn therein</l>
     <l n="90">The whereabouts of Peterkin ;</l>
     <l n="91">And , if we found the Flower , we knew</l>
     <l n="92">Father would be forgiven , too ;</l>
     <l n="93">And mother 's kiss atone for all</l>
     <l n="94">The quarrel by the rose-hung wall ;</l>
     <l n="95">We knew , not how we knew not why ,</l>
     <l n="96">But Dick it was who bade us try ,</l>
     <l n="97">Dick made it all seem plain and clear ,</l>
     <l n="98">And Dick it is who helps us here</l>
     <l n="99">To tell this tale of fairy-land</l>
     <l n="100">In words we scarce can understand .</l>
     <l n="101">For ere another golden hour</l>
     <l n="102">Had passed , our anxious parents found</l>
     <l n="103">We 'd left the scented garden-ground</l>
     <l n="104">To seek — the Smallest Flower .</l>

    <head>THE FIRST DISCOVERY</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">O , grown-ups cannot understand</l>
     <l n="2">And grown-ups never will ,</l>
     <l n="3">How short 's the way to fairy-land</l>
     <l n="4">Across the purple hill :</l>
     <l n="5">They smile : their smile is very bland ,</l>
     <l n="6">Their eyes are wise and chill ;</l>
     <l n="7">And yet — at just a child 's command —</l>
     <l n="8">The world 's an Eden still .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">Under the cloudy lilac-tree ,</l>
     <l n="10">Out at the garden-gate ,</l>
     <l n="11">We stole , a little band of three ,</l>
     <l n="12">To tempt our fairy fate .</l>
     <l n="13">There was no human eye to see ,</l>
     <l n="14">No voice to bid us wait ;</l>
     <l n="15">The gardener had gone home to tea ,</l>
     <l n="16">The hour was very late .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="17">I wonder if you 've ever dreamed ,</l>
     <l n="18">In summer 's noonday sleep ,</l>
     <l n="19">Of what the thyme and heather seemed</l>
     <l n="20">To ladybirds that creep</l>
     <l n="21">Like little crimson shimmering gems</l>
     <l n="22">Between the tiny twisted stems</l>
     <l n="23">Of fairy forests deep ;</l>
     <l n="24">And what it looks like as they pass</l>
     <l n="25">Through jungles of the golden grass .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="26">If you could suddenly become</l>
     <l n="27">As small a thing as they ,</l>
     <l n="28">A midget-child , a new Tom Thumb ,</l>
     <l n="29">A little gauze-winged fay ,</l>
     <l n="30">Oh then , as through the mighty shades</l>
     <l n="31">Of wild thyme woods and violet glades</l>
     <l n="32">You groped your forest-way ,</l>
     <l n="33">How fraught each fragrant bough would be</l>
     <l n="34">With dark o'erhanging mystery .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="35">How high the forest aisles would loom ,</l>
     <l n="36">What wondrous wings would beat</l>
     <l n="37">Through gloamings loaded with perfume</l>
     <l n="38">In many a rich retreat ,</l>
     <l n="39">While trees like purple censers bowed</l>
     <l n="40">And swung beneath a swooning cloud</l>
     <l n="41">Mysteriously sweet ,</l>
     <l n="42">Where flowers that haunt no mortal clime</l>
     <l n="43">Burden the Forest of Wild Thyme .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="44">We 'd watched the bats and beetles flit</l>
     <l n="45">Through sunset-coloured air</l>
     <l n="46">The night that we discovered it</l>
     <l n="47">And all the heavens were bare :</l>
     <l n="48">We 'd seen the colours melt and pass</l>
     <l n="49">Like silent ghosts across the grass</l>
     <l n="50">To sleep — our hearts knew where ;</l>
     <l n="51">And so we rose , and hand in hand</l>
     <l n="52">We sought the gates of fairy-land .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="53">For Peterkin , oh Peterkin ,</l>
     <l n="54">The cry was in our ears ,</l>
     <l n="55">A fairy clamour , clear and thin</l>
     <l n="56">From lands beyond the years ;</l>
     <l n="57">A wistful note , a dying fall</l>
     <l n="58">As of the fairy bugle-call</l>
     <l n="59">Some dreamful changeling hears ,</l>
     <l n="60">And pines within his mortal home</l>
     <l n="61">Once more through fairy-land to roam .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="62">We left behind the pleasant row</l>
     <l n="63">Of cottage window-panes ,</l>
     <l n="64">The village inn 's red-curtained glow ,</l>
     <l n="65">The lovers in the lanes ;</l>
     <l n="66">And stout of heart and strong of will</l>
     <l n="67">We climbed the purple perfumed hill ,</l>
     <l n="68">And hummed the sweet refrains</l>
     <l n="69">Of fairy tunes the tall thin man</l>
     <l n="70">Taught us of old in Old Japan .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="71">So by the tall wide-barred church-gate</l>
     <l n="72">Through which we all could pass</l>
     <l n="73">We came to where that curious plate ,</l>
     <l n="74">That foolish plate of brass ,</l>
     <l n="75">Said Peterkin was fast asleep</l>
     <l n="76">Beneath a cold and ugly heap</l>
     <l n="77">Of earth and stones and grass .</l>
     <l n="78">It was a splendid place for play ,</l>
     <l n="79">That churchyard , on a summer 's day ;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="80">A splendid place for hide-and-seek</l>
     <l n="81">Between the grey old stones ;</l>
     <l n="82">Where even grown-ups used to speak</l>
     <l n="83">In awestruck whispering tones ;</l>
     <l n="84">And here and there the grass ran wild</l>
     <l n="85">In jungles for the creeping child ,</l>
     <l n="86">And there were elfin zones</l>
     <l n="87">Of twisted flowers and words in rhyme</l>
     <l n="88">And great sweet cushions of wild thyme .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="89">So in a wild thyme snuggery there</l>
     <l n="90">We stayed awhile to rest ;</l>
     <l n="91">A bell was calling folk to prayer :</l>
     <l n="92">One star was in the West :</l>
     <l n="93">The cottage lights grew far away ,</l>
     <l n="94">The whole sky seemed to waver and sway</l>
     <l n="95">Above our fragrant nest ;</l>
     <l n="96">And from a distant dreamland moon</l>
     <l n="97">Once more we heard that fairy tune :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="98">Why , mother once had sung it us</l>
     <l n="99">When , ere we went to bed ,</l>
     <l n="100">She told the tale of Pyramus ,</l>
     <l n="101">How Thisbe found him dead</l>
     <l n="102">And mourned his eyes as green as leeks ,</l>
     <l n="103">His cherry nose , his cowslip cheeks .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="104">That tune would oft around us float</l>
     <l n="105">Since on a golden noon</l>
     <l n="106">We saw the play that Shakespeare wrote</l>
     <l n="107">Of Lion , Wall , and Moon ;</l>
     <l n="108">Ah , hark — the ancient fairy theme —</l>
     <l n="109">Following darkness like a dream !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="110">The very song Will Shakespeare sang ,</l>
     <l n="111">The music that through Sherwood rang</l>
     <l n="112">And Arden and that forest glade</l>
     <l n="113">Where Hermie and Lysander strayed ,</l>
     <l n="114">And Puck cried out with impish glee ,</l>
     <l n="115">Lord , what fools these mortals be !</l>
     <l n="116">Though the masquerade was mute</l>
     <l n="117">Of Quince and Snout and Snug and Flute ,</l>
     <l n="118">And Bottom with his donkey 's head</l>
     <l n="119">Decked with roses , white and red ,</l>
     <l n="120">Though the fairies had forsaken</l>
     <l n="121">Sherwood now and faintly shaken</l>
     <l n="122">The forest-scents from off their feet ,</l>
     <l n="123">Yet from some divine retreat</l>
     <l n="124">Came the music , sweet and clear ,</l>
     <l n="125">To hang upon the raptured ear</l>
     <l n="126">With the free unfettered sway</l>
     <l n="127">Of blossoms in the moon of May .</l>
     <l n="128">Hark ! the luscious fluttering</l>
     <l n="129">Of flower-soft words that kiss and cling ,</l>
     <l n="130">And part again with sweet farewells ,</l>
     <l n="131">And rhyme and chime like fairy-bells .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="132">“ I know a bank where the wild thyme blows</l>
     <l n="133">Where oxlips and the nodding violet grows ,</l>
     <l n="134">Quite over-canopied with luscious woodbine ,</l>
     <l n="135">With sweet musk-roses and with eglantine . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="136">Out of the undiscovered land</l>
     <l n="137">So sweetly rang the song ,</l>
     <l n="138">We dreamed we wandered , hand in hand ,</l>
     <l n="139">The fragrant aisles along ,</l>
     <l n="140">Where long ago had gone to dwell</l>
     <l n="141">In some enchanted distant dell</l>
     <l n="142">The outlawed fairy throng</l>
     <l n="143">When out of Sherwood 's wildest glen</l>
     <l n="144">They sank , forsaking mortal men .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="145">And as we dreamed , the shadowy ground</l>
     <l n="146">Seemed gradually to swell ;</l>
     <l n="147">And a strange forest rose around ,</l>
     <l n="148">But how — we could not tell —</l>
     <l n="149">Purple against a rose-red sky</l>
     <l n="150">The big boughs brooded silently :</l>
     <l n="151">Far off we heard a bell ;</l>
     <l n="152">And , suddenly , a great red light</l>
     <l n="153">Smouldered before our startled sight .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="154">Then came a cry , a fiercer flash ,</l>
     <l n="155">And down between the trees</l>
     <l n="156">We saw great crimson figures crash ,</l>
     <l n="157">Wild-eyed monstrosities ;</l>
     <l n="158">Great dragon-shapes that breathed a flame</l>
     <l n="159">From roaring nostrils as they came :</l>
     <l n="160">We sank upon our knees ;</l>
     <l n="161">And looming o'er us , ten yards high ,</l>
     <l n="162">Like battle-ships they thundered by .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="19">
     <l n="163">And then , as down that mighty dell</l>
     <l n="164">We followed , faint with fear ,</l>
     <l n="165">We understood the tolling bell</l>
     <l n="166">That called the monsters there ;</l>
     <l n="167">For right in front we saw a house</l>
     <l n="168">Woven of wild mysterious boughs</l>
     <l n="169">Bursting out everywhere</l>
     <l n="170">In crimson flames , and with a shout</l>
     <l n="171">The monsters rushed to put it out .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="20">
     <l n="172">And , in a flash , the truth was ours ;</l>
     <l n="173">And there we knew — we knew —</l>
     <l n="174">The meaning of those trees like flowers ,</l>
     <l n="175">Those boughs of rose and blue ,</l>
     <l n="176">And from the world we 'd left above</l>
     <l n="177">A voice came crooning like a dove</l>
     <l n="178">To prove the dream was true :</l>
     <l n="179">And this — we knew it by the rhyme</l>
     <l n="180">Must be — the Forest of Wild Thyme .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="21">
     <l n="181">For out of the mystical rose-red dome</l>
     <l n="182">Of heaven the voice came murmuring down :</l>
     <l n="183">Oh , Ladybird , Ladybird , fly away home ;</l>
     <l n="184">Your house is on fire and your children are gone .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="22">
     <l n="185">We knew , we knew it by the rhyme ,</l>
     <l n="186">Though we seemed , after all ,</l>
     <l n="187">No tinier , yet the sweet wild thyme</l>
     <l n="188">Towered like a forest tall</l>
     <l n="189">All round us ; oh , we knew not how .</l>
     <l n="190">And yet — we knew those monsters now :</l>
     <l n="191">Our dream 's divine recall</l>
     <l n="192">Had dwarfed us , as with magic words ;</l>
     <l n="193">The dragons were but ladybirds !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="23">
     <l n="194">And all around us as we gazed ,</l>
     <l n="195">Half glad , half frightened , all amazed ,</l>
     <l n="196">The scented clouds of purple smoke</l>
     <l n="197">In lurid gleams of crimson broke ;</l>
     <l n="198">And o'er our heads the huge black trees</l>
     <l n="199">Obscured the sky 's red mysteries ;</l>
     <l n="200">While here and there gigantic wings</l>
     <l n="201">Beat o'er us , and great scaly things</l>
     <l n="202">Fold over monstrous leathern fold</l>
     <l n="203">Out of the smouldering copses rolled ;</l>
     <l n="204">And eyes like blood-red pits of flame</l>
     <l n="205">From many a forest-cavern came</l>
     <l n="206">To glare across the blazing glade ,</l>
     <l n="207">Till , with the sudden thought dismayed ,</l>

     <l n="209">The mortal home we left behind :</l>

     <l n="214">And hurry-skurry , heart and heel and hand , we tore along ,</l>

     <l n="216">For Peterkin , oh Peterkin , it made a kind of song</l>
     <l n="217">To prove the road was right although it seemed so dark and wrong ,</l>
     <l n="218">As through the desperate woods we plunged and ploughed for little</l>

     <l n="220">Where many a hidden jungle-beast made noises like a gong</l>
     <l n="221">That rolled and roared and rumbled as we rushed along to Peterkin .</l>

     <l n="222">Peterkin , Peterkin , if you could only hear</l>
     <l n="223">And answer us , one little word from little lonely Peterkin</l>
     <l n="224">To take and comfort father , he is sitting in his chair</l>
     <l n="225">In the library : he 's listening for your footstep on the stair</l>
     <l n="226">And your patter down the passage , he can only think of Peterkin :</l>

     <l n="44">Back to the upper lands of day ;</l>
     <l n="45">Great silken cables overhead</l>

     <l n="63">And a hideous hermit cried</l>
     <l n="64">With a shy and soothing smile from out his lair ,</l>

     <l n="69">Wo n't you walk into my parlour ? said the spider to the fly !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="70">Then we looked a little closer at the ogre as he stood</l>

     <l n="72">And his mighty speckled belly and his dreadful clutching claws</l>
     <l n="73">And his nose — a horny parrot 's beak , his whiskers and his jaws ;</l>
     <l n="74">Yet he seemed so sympathetic , and we saw two tears descend ,</l>
     <l n="75">As he murmured , “ I 'm so ugly , but I 've lost my dearest friend !</l>
     <l n="76">I tell you most lymphatic'ly , I 've yearnings in my soul , ” —</l>
     <l n="77">And right along his parrot 's beak we saw the tear-drops roll ;</l>
     <l n="78">He 's an arrant sentimentalist , we heard a distant sigh ,</l>

     <l n="98">There were scarlet gleams and crimson</l>
     <l n="99">In the curious foggy grey ,</l>

     <l n="113">That we could n't doubt his kindness , and we smothered all our fears ;</l>
     <l n="114">But he said , “ You must be crazy if you come to me for help ;</l>
     <l n="115">Why should I desire to send you to your horrid little whelp ? ”</l>
     <l n="116">And again , the foolish echo made a far-away reply ,</l>

     <l n="118">Pray do n't look to me for comfort ,</l>

     <l n="1">Shyly we surveyed our guides</l>

     <l n="3">In the light that the straggling moonbeams lent :</l>
     <l n="4">We envied them their easy strides !</l>
     <l n="5">Pease-blossom in his crimson cap</l>
     <l n="6">And delicate suit of rose-leaf green ,</l>
     <l n="7">His crimson sash and his jewelled dagger ,</l>
     <l n="8">Strutted along with an elegant swagger</l>
     <l n="9">Which showed that he did n't care one rap</l>
     <l n="10">For anything less than a Fairy Queen :</l>
     <l n="11">His eyes were deep like the eyes of a poet ,</l>
     <l n="12">Although his crisp and curly hair</l>
     <l n="13">Certainly did n't seem to show it !</l>
     <l n="14">While Mustard-seed was a devil-may-care</l>
     <l n="15">Epigrammatic and pungent fellow</l>
     <l n="16">Clad in a splendid suit of yellow ,</l>
     <l n="17">With emerald stars on his glittering breast</l>
     <l n="18">And eyes that shone with a diamond light :</l>
     <l n="19">They made you feel sure it would always be best</l>
     <l n="20">To tell him the truth : he was not perhaps quite</l>
     <l n="21">So polite as Pease-blossom , but then who could be</l>

     <l n="26">By the side of a nest like a great thick wood :</l>
     <l n="27">The clouds in glimmering wreaths were spread</l>
     <l n="28">Behind its vast and shadowy head</l>
     <l n="29">Which rolled at us trembling below . ( Its eyes</l>
     <l n="30">Were like great black moons in those pearl-pale skies . )</l>
     <l n="31">And we feared he might take us , perhaps , for a worm .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="32">But he ruffled his breast with the sound of a storm ,</l>
     <l n="33">And snuggled his head with a careless disdain</l>
     <l n="34">Under his huge hunched wing again ;</l>
     <l n="35">And Mustard-seed said , as we stole thro ’ the dark ,</l>
     <l n="36">There was nothing to fear : it was only a Lark !</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="37">And so he cheered the way along</l>
     <l n="38">With many a neat little epigram ,</l>
     <l n="39">While dear Pease-blossom before him swam</l>
     <l n="40">On a billow of lovely moonlit song ,</l>
     <l n="41">Telling us why they had left their home</l>
     <l n="42">In Sherwood , and had hither come</l>
     <l n="43">To dwell in this magical scented clime ,</l>
     <l n="44">This dim old Forest of sweet Wild Thyme ,</l>

     <l n="48">The trust that in their souls was laid ;</l>
     <l n="49">Their fairy birthright they have sold</l>
     <l n="50">For little disks of mortal gold ;</l>
     <l n="51">And now they cannot even see</l>
     <l n="52">The gold upon the greenwood tree ,</l>
     <l n="53">The wealth of coloured lights that pass</l>
     <l n="54">In soft gradations through the grass ,</l>
     <l n="55">The riches of the love untold</l>
     <l n="56">That wakes the day from grey to gold ;</l>
     <l n="57">And howsoe'er the moonlight weaves</l>
     <l n="58">Magic webs among the leaves</l>
     <l n="59">Englishmen care little now</l>

     <l n="61">Nor if Robin should return</l>

     <l n="13">Her wonder-woven hair ;</l>
     <l n="14">Her face leaned out and took the sacred glow</l>

     <l n="20">Bleed through her eyes with the slow pain of years ,</l>
     <l n="21">And her mouth yearned to say —</l>
     <l n="22">“ Friend , is there any message , from the tomb</l>
     <l n="23">Where love lies buried ? ” But she only said —</l>

     <l n="70">Against the iron shores ; and faint and grey</l>

     <l n="78">To bathe beneath the honey-coloured moon :</l>

   <p>Lulled by the wash of the feathery grasses , a sea with many a sun-swept billow , Heart to heart in the heart of the summer , lover by lover asleep they lay , Hearing only the whirring cicala that chirruped awhile at their poppied pillow Faint and sweet as the murmur of men that laboured in villages far away .</p>
   <p>Was not the menace indeed more silent ? Ah , what care for labour and sorrow ? Gods in the meadows of moly and amaranth surely might envy their deep sweet bed Here where the butterflies troubled the lilies of peace , and took no thought for the morrow , And golden-girdled bees made feast as over the lotus the soft sun spread .</p>
   <p>Nearer , nearer the menace glided , out of the gorgeous gloom around them , Out of the poppy-haunted shadows deep in the heart of the purple brake ; Till through the hush and the heat as they lay , and their own sweet listless dreams enwound them ,— Mailed and mottled with hues of the grape-bloom suddenly , quietly , glided the snake .</p>
   <p>Subtle as jealousy , supple as falsehood , diamond-headed and cruel as pleasure , Coil by coil he lengthened and glided , straight to the fragrant curve of her throat : There in the print of the last of the kisses that still glowed red from the sweet long pressure , Fierce as famine and swift as lightning over the glittering lyre he smote .</p>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">When on the highest ridge of that strange land ,</l>
     <l n="2">Under the cloudless blinding tropic blue ,</l>
     <l n="3">Drake and his band of swarthy seamen stood</l>
     <l n="4">With dazed eyes gazing round them , emerald fans</l>
     <l n="5">Of palm that fell like fountains over cliffs</l>
     <l n="6">Of gorgeous red anana bloom obscured</l>
     <l n="7">Their sight on every side . Illustrious gleams</l>
     <l n="8">Of rose and green and gold streamed from the plumes</l>
     <l n="9">That flashed like living rainbows through the glades .</l>
     <l n="10">Piratic glints of musketoon and sword ,</l>
     <l n="11">The scarlet scarves around the tawny throats ,</l>
     <l n="12">The bright gold ear-rings in the sun-black ears ,</l>
     <l n="13">And the calm faces of the negro guides</l>
     <l n="14">Opposed their barbarous bravery to the noon ;</l>
     <l n="15">Yet a deep silence dreadfully besieged</l>
     <l n="16">Even those mighty hearts upon the verge</l>
     <l n="17">Of the undiscovered world . Behind them lay</l>
     <l n="18">The old earth they knew . In front they could not see</l>
     <l n="19">What lay beyond the ridge . Only they heard</l>
     <l n="20">Cries of the painted birds troubling the heat</l>
     <l n="21">And shivering through the woods ; till Francis Drake</l>
     <l n="22">Plunged through the hush , took hold upon a tree ,</l>
     <l n="23">The tallest near them , and clomb upward , branch</l>
     <l n="24">By branch .</l>
     <l n="25">And there , as he swung clear above</l>
     <l n="26">The steep-down forest , on his wondering eyes ,</l>
     <l n="27">Mile upon mile of rugged shimmering gold ,</l>
     <l n="28">Burst the unknown immeasurable sea .</l>
     <l n="29">Then he descended ; and with a new voice</l>
     <l n="30">Vowed that , God helping , he would one day plough</l>

     <l n="35">The wild adventures and heroic deeds</l>
     <l n="36">Of England 's epic age , a vision lit</l>
     <l n="37">With mighty prophecies , fraught with a doom</l>
     <l n="38">Worthy the great Homeric roll of song ,</l>
     <l n="39">Yet all unsung and unrecorded quite</l>
     <l n="40">By those who might have touched with Raphael 's hand</l>
     <l n="41">The large imperial legend of our race ,</l>
     <l n="42">Ere it brought forth the braggarts of an hour ,</l>
     <l n="43">Self-worshippers who love their imaged strength ,</l>
     <l n="44">And as a symbol for their own proud selves</l>
     <l n="45">Misuse the sacred name of this dear land ,</l>
     <l n="46">While England to the Empire of her soul</l>
     <l n="47">Like some great Prophet passes through the crowd</l>
     <l n="48">That cannot understand ; for he must climb</l>
     <l n="49">Up to that sovran thunder-smitten peak</l>

     <l n="51">The Law that God shall utter by the still</l>
     <l n="52">Small voice , not by the whirlwind or the fire .</l>
     <l n="53">There labouring for the Highest in himself</l>
     <l n="54">He shall achieve the good of all mankind ;</l>
     <l n="55">And from that lonely Sinai shall return</l>
     <l n="56">Triumphant o'er the little gods of gold</l>

     <l n="67">Up to the throne of Mary ; as a child</l>
     <l n="68">Gathering with friends upon a winter 's morn</l>
     <l n="69">For some mock fight between the hateful prince</l>
     <l n="70">Philip and Thomas Wyatt , all at once</l>
     <l n="71">Might see in gorgeous ruffs embastioned</l>
     <l n="72">Popinjay plumes and slouching hats of Spain ,</l>

     <l n="76">Strutting along the white snow-strangled street ,</l>

     <l n="79">Put them to flight with snowballs , while the wind</l>
     <l n="80">All round their Spanish ears hissed like a flight</l>
     <l n="81">Of white-winged geese ; so may I wage perchance</l>
     <l n="82">A mimic war with all my heart in it ,</l>
     <l n="83">Munitioned with mere perishable snow</l>
     <l n="84">Which mightier hands one day will urge with steel .</l>

     <l n="90">Of that great seaman , good at need , who first</l>
     <l n="91">Sailed round this globe and made one little isle ,</l>
     <l n="92">One little isle against that huge Empire</l>
     <l n="93">Of Spain whose might was paramount on earth ,</l>
     <l n="94">O'ertopping Babylon , Nineveh , Greece , and Rome ,</l>
     <l n="95">Carthage and all huge Empires of the past ,</l>
     <l n="96">He made this little isle , against the world ,</l>
     <l n="97">Queen of the earth and sea . Nor this alone</l>
     <l n="98">The theme ; for , in a mightier strife engaged</l>
     <l n="99">Even than he knew , he fought for the new faiths ,</l>
     <l n="100">Championing our manhood as it rose</l>
     <l n="101">And cast its feudal chains before the seat</l>
     <l n="102">Of kings ; nay , in a mightier battle yet</l>
     <l n="103">He fought for the soul 's freedom , fought the fight</l>
     <l n="104">Which , though it still rings in our wondering ears ,</l>
     <l n="105">Was won then and for ever — that great war ,</l>
     <l n="106">That last Crusade of Christ against His priests ,</l>
     <l n="107">Wherein Spain fell behind a thunderous roar</l>
     <l n="108">Of ocean triumph over burning ships</l>
     <l n="109">And shattered fleets , while England , England rose ,</l>
     <l n="110">Her white cliffs laughing out across the waves ,</l>
     <l n="111">Victorious over all her enemies .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="112">And while he won the world for her domain ,</l>
     <l n="113">Her loins brought forth , her fostering bosom fed</l>
     <l n="114">Souls that have swept the spiritual seas</l>
     <l n="115">From heaven to hell , and justified her crown .</l>
     <l n="116">For round the throne of great Elizabeth</l>
     <l n="117">Spenser and Burleigh , Sidney and Verulam ,</l>
     <l n="118">Clustered like stars , rare Jonson like the crown</l>
     <l n="119">Of Cassiopeia , Marlowe ruddy as Mars ,</l>
     <l n="120">And over all those mighty hearts arose</l>
     <l n="121">The soul of Shakespeare brooding far and wide</l>
     <l n="122">Beyond our small horizons , like a light</l>
     <l n="123">Thrown from a vaster sun that still illumes</l>
     <l n="124">Tracts which the arc of our increasing day</l>

     <l n="126">Mother and love , fair England , hear my prayer ,</l>
     <l n="127">As thou didst touch the heart and light the flame</l>
     <l n="128">Of wonder in those eyes which first awoke</l>
     <l n="129">To beauty and the sea 's adventurous dream</l>
     <l n="130">Three hundred years ago , three hundred years ,</l>
     <l n="131">And five long decades , in the leafy lanes</l>

     <l n="137">So hear me , and so help , for more than his</l>

     <l n="139">Upon that wild adventure with three ships</l>
     <l n="140">And three-score men from grey old Plymouth Sound ,</l>
     <l n="141">Not knowing if he went to life or death ,</l>
     <l n="142">Not caring greatly , so that he were true</l>
     <l n="143">To his own sleepless and unfaltering soul</l>
     <l n="144">Which could not choose but hear the ringing call</l>
     <l n="145">Across the splendours of the Spanish Main</l>
     <l n="146">From ever fading , ever new horizons ,</l>

     <l n="151">Wider than that Ulysses roamed of old ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Now through the great doors of the Council-room</l>
     <l n="2">Magnificently streamed in rich array</l>
     <l n="3">The peers of England , regal of aspèct</l>
     <l n="4">And grave . Their silence waited for the Queen :</l>
     <l n="5">And even now she came ; and through their midst ,</l>
     <l n="6">Low as they bowed , she passed without a smile</l>
     <l n="7">And took her royal seat . A bodeful hush</l>
     <l n="8">Of huge anticipation gripped all hearts ,</l>
     <l n="9">Compressed all brows , and loaded the broad noon</l>
     <l n="10">With gathering thunder : none knew what the hour</l>
     <l n="11">Might yet bring forth ; but the dark fire of war</l>
     <l n="12">Smouldered in every eye ; for every day</l>
     <l n="13">The Council met debating how to join</l>
     <l n="14">Honour with peace , and every day new tales</l>
     <l n="15">Of English wrongs received from the red hands</l>
     <l n="16">Of that gigantic Empire , insolent</l>
     <l n="17">Spain , spurred fiercer resentments up like steeds</l>
     <l n="18">Revolting , on the curb , foaming for battle ,</l>
     <l n="19">In all men 's minds , against whatever odds .</l>
     <l n="20">On one side of the throne great Walsingham ,</l>
     <l n="21">A lion of England , couchant , watchful , calm ,</l>
     <l n="22">Was now the master of opinion : all</l>
     <l n="23">Drew to him . Even the hunchback Burleigh smiled</l>
     <l n="24">With half-ironic admiration now ,</l>
     <l n="25">As in the presence of the Queen they met</l>
     <l n="26">Amid the sweeping splendours of her court ,</l>
     <l n="27">A cynic smile that seemed to say , “ I , too ,</l>
     <l n="28">Would fain regain that forthright heart of fire ;</l>
     <l n="29">Yet statesmanship is but a smoother name</l>
     <l n="30">For the superior cunning which ensures</l>
     <l n="31">Victory . ” And the Queen , too , knowing her strength</l>
     <l n="32">And weakness , though her woman 's heart leaped out</l>
     <l n="33">To courage , yet with woman 's craft preferred</l>
     <l n="34">The subtler strength of Burleigh ; for she knew</l>
     <l n="35">Mary of Scotland waited for that war</l>
     <l n="36">To strike her in the side for Rome ; she knew</l>
     <l n="37">How many thousands lurked in England still</l>
     <l n="38">Remembering Rome and bloody Mary 's reign .</l>
     <l n="39">France o'er a wall of bleeding Huguenots</l>
     <l n="40">Watched for an hour to strike . Against all these</l>
     <l n="41">What shield could England raise , this little isle ,—</l>
     <l n="42">Out-matched , outnumbered , perilously near</l>
     <l n="43">Utter destruction ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="44">So the long debate</l>
     <l n="45">Proceeded .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="46">All at once there came a cry</l>
     <l n="47">Along the streets and at the palace-gates</l>
     <l n="48">And at the great doors of the Council-room !</l>
     <l n="49">Then through the pikes and halberds a voice rose</l>
     <l n="50">Imperative for entrance , and the guards</l>
     <l n="51">Made way , and a strange whisper surged around ,</l>
     <l n="52">And through the peers of England thrilled the blood</l>
     <l n="53">Of Agincourt as to the foot of the throne</l>
     <l n="54">Came Leicester , for behind him as he came</l>
     <l n="55">A seaman stumbled , travel-stained and torn ,</l>
     <l n="56">Crying for justice , and gasped out his tale .</l>
     <l n="57">“ The Spaniards , ” he moaned , “ the Inquisition !</l>
     <l n="58">They have taken all my comrades , all our crew ,</l>
     <l n="59">And flung them into dungeons : there they lie</l>
     <l n="60">Waiting for England , waiting for their Queen !</l>
     <l n="61">Will you not free them ? I alone am left !</l>
     <l n="62">All London is afire with it , for this</l>
     <l n="63">Was one of your chief city merchant 's ships —</l>
     <l n="64">The Pride of London , one of Osborne 's ships !</l>
     <l n="65">But there is none to help them ! I escaped</l>
     <l n="66">With shrieks of torment ringing in these ears ,</l>
     <l n="67">The glare of torture-chambers in these eyes</l>
     <l n="68">That see no faces anywhere but blind</l>
     <l n="69">Blind faces , each a bruise of white that smiles</l>
     <l n="70">In idiot agony , washed with sweat and blood ,</l>
     <l n="71">The face of some strange thing that once was man ,</l>
     <l n="72">And now can only turn from side to side</l>
     <l n="73">Babbling like a child , with mouth agape ,</l>
     <l n="74">And crying for help where there is none to hear</l>
     <l n="75">Save those black vizards in the furnace-glow ,</l>
     <l n="76">Moving like devils at their hellish trade .... ”</l>
     <l n="77">He paused ; his memory sickened , his brain swooned</l>
     <l n="78">Back into that wild glare of obscene pain !</l>
     <l n="79">Once more to his ears and nostrils horribly crept</l>
     <l n="80">The hiss and smell of shrivelling human flesh !</l>
     <l n="81">His dumb stare told the rest : his head sank down ;</l>
     <l n="82">He strove in agony</l>
     <l n="83">With what all hideous words must leave untold ;</l>
     <l n="84">While Leicester vouched him , “ This man 's tale is true ! ”</l>
     <l n="85">But like a gathering storm a low deep moan</l>
     <l n="86">Of passion , like a tiger 's , slowly crept</l>
     <l n="87">From the grey lips of Walsingham . “ My Queen ,</l>
     <l n="88">Will you not free them ? ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="89">Then Elizabeth ,</l>
     <l n="90">Whose name is one for ever with the name</l>
     <l n="91">Of England , rose ; and in her face the gleam</l>
     <l n="92">Of justice that makes anger terrible</l>
     <l n="93">Shone , and she stretched her glittering sceptre forth</l>
     <l n="94">And spoke , with distant empires in her eyes .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="95">“ My lords , this is the last cry they shall wring</l>
     <l n="96">From English lips unheeded : we will have</l>
     <l n="97">Such remedies for this as all the world</l>
     <l n="98">Shall tremble at ! ”</l>
     <l n="99">And , on that night , while Drake</l>
     <l n="100">Close in his London lodging lay concealed</l>
     <l n="101">Until he knew if it were peace or war</l>
     <l n="102">With Spain ( for he had struck on the high seas</l>
     <l n="103">At Spain ; and well he knew if it were peace</l>
     <l n="104">His blood would be made witness to that bond ,</l>
     <l n="105">And he must die a pirate 's death or fly</l>
     <l n="106">Westward once more ) , there all alone , he pored</l>
     <l n="107">By a struggling rushlight o'er a well-thumbed chart</l>
     <l n="108">Of magic islands in the enchanted seas ,</l>
     <l n="109">Dreaming , as boys and poets only dream</l>
     <l n="110">With those that see God 's wonders in the deep ,</l>
     <l n="111">Perilous visions of those palmy keys ,</l>
     <l n="112">Cocoa-nut islands , parrot-haunted woods ,</l>
     <l n="113">Crisp coral reefs and blue shark-finned lagoons</l>
     <l n="114">Fringed with the creaming foam , mile upon mile</l>
     <l n="115">Of mystery . Dream after dream went by ,</l>
     <l n="116">Colouring the brown air of that London night</l>
     <l n="117">With many a mad miraculous romance .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="118">There , suddenly , some augury , some flash</l>
     <l n="119">Showed him a coming promise , a strange hint ,</l>
     <l n="120">Which , though he played with it , he scarce believed ;</l>
     <l n="121">Strange as in some dark cave the first fierce gleam</l>
     <l n="122">Of pirate gold to some forlorn maroon</l>
     <l n="123">Who tiptoes to the heap and glances round</l>
     <l n="124">Askance , and dreads to hear what erst he longed</l>
     <l n="125">To hear — some voice to break the hush ; but bathes</l>
     <l n="126">Both hands with childish laughter in the gold ,</l>
     <l n="127">And lets it trickle through his fevered palms ,</l>
     <l n="128">And begins counting half a hundred times</l>
     <l n="129">And loses count each time for sheer delight</l>
     <l n="130">And wonder in it ; meantime , if he knew ,</l>
     <l n="131">Passing the cave-mouth , far away , beyond</l>
     <l n="132">The still lagoon , the coral reef , the foam</l>
     <l n="133">And the white fluttering chatter of the birds ,</l>
     <l n="134">A sail that might have saved him comes and goes</l>
     <l n="135">Unseen across the blue Pacific sea .</l>
     <l n="136">So Drake , too , played with fancies ; but that sail</l>
     <l n="137">Passed not unseen , for suddenly there came</l>
     <l n="138">A firm and heavy footstep to the door ,</l>
     <l n="139">Then a loud knocking : and , at first , he thought</l>
     <l n="140">“ I am a dead man : there is peace with Spain ,</l>
     <l n="141">And they are come to lead me to my doom . ”</l>
     <l n="142">But , as he looked across one shoulder , pride</l>
     <l n="143">Checking the fuller watch for what he feared ,</l>
     <l n="144">The door opened ; and cold as from the sea</l>
     <l n="145">The night rushed in , and there against the gloom ,</l>
     <l n="146">Clad , as it seemed , with wind and cloud and rain ,</l>
     <l n="147">There loomed a stately form and high grim face</l>
     <l n="148">Loaded with deadly thoughts of iron war —</l>
     <l n="149">Walsingham ,— in one hand he held a map</l>
     <l n="150">Marked with red lines ; the other hand held down</l>
     <l n="151">The rich encrusted hilt of his great sword .</l>
     <l n="152">Then Drake rose , and the other cautiously</l>
     <l n="153">Closing the door drew near the flickering light</l>
     <l n="154">And spread his map out on the table , saying —</l>
     <l n="155">“ Mark for me here the points whereat the King</l>
     <l n="156">Philip of Spain may best be wounded , mark</l>
     <l n="157">The joints of his harness ; ” and Drake looked at him</l>
     <l n="158">Thinking , “ If he betray me , I am dead . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="159">But the soldier met his eyes and , with a laugh ,</l>
     <l n="160">Drake , quivering like a bloodhound in the leash ,</l>
     <l n="161">Stooped , with his finger pointing thus and thus —</l>
     <l n="162">“ Here would I guard , here would I lie in wait ,</l>
     <l n="163">Here would I strike him through the breast and throat . ”</l>
     <l n="164">And as he spoke he kindled , and began</l>
     <l n="165">To set forth his great dreams , and high romance</l>
     <l n="166">Rose like a moon reflecting the true sun</l>
     <l n="167">Unseen ; and as the full round moon indeed</l>
     <l n="168">Rising behind a mighty mountain-chain</l>
     <l n="169">Will shadow forth in outline grim and black</l>
     <l n="170">Its vast and ragged edges , so that moon</l>
     <l n="171">Of high romance rose greatly shadowing forth</l>
     <l n="172">The grandeur of his dreams , until their might</l>
     <l n="173">Dawned upon Walsingham , and he , too , saw</l>
     <l n="174">For a moment of muffled moonlight and wild cloud</l>
     <l n="175">The vision of the imperious years to be !</l>
     <l n="176">But suddenly Drake paused as one who strays</l>
     <l n="177">Beyond the bounds of caution , paused and cursed</l>
     <l n="178">His tongue for prating like a moon-struck boy 's .</l>
     <l n="179">“ I am mad , ” he cried , “ I am mad to babble so ! ”</l>
     <l n="180">Then Walsingham drew near him with strange eyes</l>
     <l n="181">And muttered slowly , “ Write that madness down ;</l>
     <l n="182">Ay , write it down , that madman 's plan of thine ;</l>
     <l n="183">Sign it , and let me take it to the Queen . ”</l>
     <l n="184">But the weather-wiser seaman warily</l>
     <l n="185">Answered him , “ If it please Almighty God</l>
     <l n="186">To take away our Queen Elizabeth ,</l>
     <l n="187">Seeing that she is mortal as ourselves ,</l>
     <l n="188">England might then be leagued with Spain , and I</l>
     <l n="189">Should here have sealed my doom . I will not put</l>
     <l n="190">My pen to paper . ”</l>
     <l n="191">So , across the charts</l>
     <l n="192">With that dim light on each grim countenance</l>
     <l n="193">The seaman and the courtier subtly fenced</l>
     <l n="194">With words and thoughts , but neither would betray</l>
     <l n="195">His whole heart to the other . At the last</l>
     <l n="196">Walsingham gripped the hand of Francis Drake</l>
     <l n="197">And left him wondering .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="198">On the third night came</l>
     <l n="199">A messenger from Walsingham who bade</l>
     <l n="200">Drake to the Palace where , without one word ,</l>
     <l n="201">The statesman met him in an anteroom</l>
     <l n="202">And led him , with flushed cheek and beating heart ,</l>
     <l n="203">Along a mighty gold-gloomed corridor</l>
     <l n="204">Into a high-arched chamber , hung with tall</l>
     <l n="205">Curtains of gold-fringed silk and tapestries</l>
     <l n="206">From Flanders looms , whereon were flowers and beasts</l>
     <l n="207">And forest-work , great knights , with hawk on hand ,</l>
     <l n="208">Riding for ever on their glimmering steeds</l>
     <l n="209">Through bowery glades to some immortal face</l>
     <l n="210">Beyond the fairy fringes of the world .</l>
     <l n="211">A silver lamp swung softly overhead ,</l>
     <l n="212">Fed with some perfumed oil that shed abroad</l>
     <l n="213">Delicious light and fragrances as rare</l>
     <l n="214">As those that stirred faint wings at eventide</l>
     <l n="215">Through the King 's House in Lebanon of old .</l>
     <l n="216">Into a quietness as of fallen bloom</l>
     <l n="217">Their feet sank in that chamber ; and , all round ,</l>
     <l n="218">Soft hills of Moorish cushions dimly drowsed</l>
     <l n="219">On glimmering crimson couches . Near the lamp</l>
     <l n="220">An ebony chess-board stood inlaid with squares</l>
     <l n="221">Of ruby and emerald , garnished with cinquefoils</l>
     <l n="222">Of silver , bears and ragged staves ; the men ,</l>
     <l n="223">Likewise of precious stones , were all arrayed —</l>
     <l n="224">Bishops and knights and elephants and pawns —</l>
     <l n="225">As for a game . Sixteen of them were set</l>
     <l n="226">In silver white , the other sixteen gilt .</l>
     <l n="227">Now , as Drake gazed upon an arras , nigh</l>
     <l n="228">The farther doors , whereon was richly wrought</l>
     <l n="229">The picture of that grave and lovely queen</l>
     <l n="230">Penelope , with cold hands weaving still</l>
     <l n="231">The unending web , while in an outer court</l>
     <l n="232">The broad-limbed wooers basking in the sun</l>
     <l n="233">On purple fleeces took from white-armed girls ,</l>
     <l n="234">Up-kirtled to the knee , the crimson wine ;</l>
     <l n="235">There , as he gazed and thought , “ Is this not like</l>
     <l n="236">Our Queen Elizabeth who waits and weaves ,</l>
     <l n="237">Penelope of England , her dark web</l>
     <l n="238">Unendingly till England 's Empire come ; ”</l>
     <l n="239">There , as he gazed , for a moment , he could vow</l>
     <l n="240">The pictured arras moved . Well had it been</l>
     <l n="241">Had he drawn sword and pierced it through and through ;</l>
     <l n="242">But he suspected nothing and said nought</l>
     <l n="243">To Walsingham ; for thereupon they heard</l>
     <l n="244">The sound of a low lute and a sweet voice</l>
     <l n="245">Carolling like a gold-caged nightingale ,</l>
     <l n="246">Caught by the fowlers ere he found his mate ,</l>
     <l n="247">And singing all his heart out evermore</l>
     <l n="248">To the unknown forest-love he ne'er should see .</l>
     <l n="249">And Walsingham smiled sadly to himself ,</l>
     <l n="250">Knowing the weary queen had bidden some maid</l>
     <l n="251">Sing to her , even as David sang to Saul ;</l>
     <l n="252">Since all her heart was bitter with her love</l>
     <l n="253">Or so it was breathed ( and there the chess-board stood ,</l>
     <l n="254">Her love 's device upon it ) , though she still ,</l>
     <l n="255">For England 's sake , must keep great foreign kings</l>
     <l n="256">Her suitors , wedding no man till she died .</l>
     <l n="257">Nor did she know how , in her happiest hour</l>
     <l n="258">Remembered now most sorrowfully , the moon ,</l>
     <l n="259">Vicegerent of the sky , through summer dews ,</l>
     <l n="260">As that sweet ballad tells in plaintive rhyme ,</l>
     <l n="261">Silvering the grey old Cumnor towers and all</l>
     <l n="262">The hollow haunted oaks that grew thereby ,</l>
     <l n="263">Gleamed on a casement whence the pure white face</l>
     <l n="264">Of Amy Robsart , wife of Leicester , wife</l>
     <l n="265">Unknown of the Queen 's lover , a frail bar</l>
     <l n="266">To that proud Earl 's ambition , quietly gazed</l>
     <l n="267">And heard the night-owl hoot a dark presage</l>
     <l n="268">Of murder through her timid shuddering heart .</l>
     <l n="269">But of that deed Elizabeth knew nought ;</l>
     <l n="270">Nay , white as Amy Robsart in her dream</l>
     <l n="271">Of love she listened to the sobbing lute ,</l>
     <l n="272">Bitterly happy , proudly desolate ;</l>
     <l n="273">So heavy are all earth 's crowns and sharp with thorns !</l>
     <l n="274">But tenderly that high-born maiden sang .</l>

     <l n="33">The song ceased : all was still ; and now it seemed</l>
     <l n="34">Power brooded on the silence , and Drake saw</l>
     <l n="35">A woman come to meet him ,— tall and pale</l>
     <l n="36">And proud she seemed : behind her head two wings</l>
     <l n="37">As of some mighty phantom butterfly</l>
     <l n="38">Glimmered with jewel-sparks in the gold gloom .</l>
     <l n="39">Her small , pure , grey-eyed face above her ruff</l>
     <l n="40">Was chiselled like an agate ; and he knew</l>
     <l n="41">It was the Queen . Low bent he o'er her hand ;</l>
     <l n="42">And “ Ah , ” she said , “ Sir Francis Walsingham</l>
     <l n="43">Hath told me what an English heart beats here !</l>
     <l n="44">Know you what injuries the King of Spain</l>
     <l n="45">Hath done us ? ” Drake looked up at her : she smiled ,</l>
     <l n="46">“ We find you apt ! Will you not be our knight</l>
     <l n="47">For we are helpless ” — witchingly she smiled —</l>
     <l n="48">“ We are not ripe for war ; our policy</l>
     <l n="49">Must still be to uphold the velvet cloak</l>
     <l n="50">Of peace ; but I would have it mask the hand</l>
     <l n="51">That holds the dagger ! Will you not unfold</l>
     <l n="52">Your scheme to us ? ” And then with a low bow</l>
     <l n="53">Walsingham , at a signal from the Queen ,</l>
     <l n="54">Withdrew ; and she looked down at Drake and smiled ;</l>
     <l n="55">And in his great simplicity the man</l>
     <l n="56">Spake all his heart out like some youthful knight</l>
     <l n="57">Before his Gloriana : his heart burned ,</l>
     <l n="58">Knowing he talked with England , face to face ;</l>
     <l n="59">And suddenly the Queen bent down to him ,</l>
     <l n="60">England bent down to him , and his heart reeled</l>
     <l n="61">With the beauty of her presence — for indeed</l>
     <l n="62">Women alone have royal power like this</l>
     <l n="63">Within their very selves enthroned and shrined</l>
     <l n="64">To draw men 's hearts out ! Royal she bent down</l>
     <l n="65">And touched his hand for a moment . “ Friend , ” she said ,</l>
     <l n="66">Looking into his face with subtle eyes ,</l>
     <l n="67">“ I have searched thy soul to-night and know full well</l>
     <l n="68">How I can trust thee ! Canst thou think that I ,</l>
     <l n="69">The daughter of my royal father , lack</l>
     <l n="70">The fire which every boor in England feels</l>
     <l n="71">Burning within him as the bloody score</l>
     <l n="72">Which Spain writes on the flesh of Englishmen</l>
     <l n="73">Mounts higher day by day ? Am I not Tudor ?</l>
     <l n="74">I am not deaf or blind ; nor yet a king !</l>
     <l n="75">I am a woman and a queen , and where</l>
     <l n="76">Kings would have plunged into their red revenge</l>
     <l n="77">Or set their throne up on this temporal shore ,</l>
     <l n="78">As flatterers bade that wiser king Canúte ,</l>
     <l n="79">Thence to command the advancing tides of battle</l>
     <l n="80">Till one ensanguined sea whelm throne and king</l>

     <l n="82">Smile in mine enemies ’ faces with a heart</l>
     <l n="83">All hell , and undermine them hour by hour !</l>
     <l n="84">This island scarce can fend herself from France ,</l>
     <l n="85">And now Spain holds the keys of all the world ,</l>
     <l n="86">How should we fight her , save that my poor wit</l>
     <l n="87">Hath won the key to Philip ? Oh , I know</l>
     <l n="88">His treacherous lecherous heart , and hour by hour</l>
     <l n="89">My nets are drawing round him . I , that starve</l>
     <l n="90">My public armies , feed his private foes ,</l>
     <l n="91">Nourish his rebels in the Netherlands ,</l>
     <l n="92">Nay , sacrifice mine own poor woman 's heart</l>
     <l n="93">To keep him mine , and surely now stands Fate</l>
     <l n="94">With hand uplifted by the doors of Spain</l>
     <l n="95">Ready to knock : the time is close at hand</l>
     <l n="96">When I shall strike , once , and no second stroke .</l>
     <l n="97">Remember , friend , though kings have fought for her ,</l>
     <l n="98">This England , with the trident in her grasp ,</l>
     <l n="99">Was ever woman ; and she waits her throne ;</l>
     <l n="100">And thou canst speed it . Furnish thee with ships ,</l>
     <l n="101">Gather thy gentleman adventurers ,</l>
     <l n="102">And be assured thy parsimonious queen —</l>
     <l n="103">Oh ay , she knows that chattering of the world —</l>
     <l n="104">Will find thee wealth enough . Then put to sea ,</l>
     <l n="105">Fly the black flag of piracy awhile</l>
     <l n="106">Against these blackest foes of all mankind .</l>
     <l n="107">Nay ; what hast thou to do with piracy ?</l>
     <l n="108">Hostis humani generis indeed</l>
     <l n="109">Is Spain : she dwells beyond the bounds of law ;</l>
     <l n="110">Thine is no piracy , whate'er men say ,</l>
     <l n="111">Thou art a knight on Gloriana 's quest .</l>
     <l n="112">Oh , lay that golden unction to thy soul ,</l>
     <l n="113">This is no piracy , but glorious war ,</l>
     <l n="114">Waged for thy country and for all mankind ,</l>
     <l n="115">Therefore put out to sea without one fear ,</l>
     <l n="116">Ransack their El Dorados of the West ,</l>
     <l n="117">Pillage their golden galleons , sap their strength</l>
     <l n="118">Even at its utmost fountains ; let them know</l>
     <l n="119">That there is blood , not water , in our veins .</l>
     <l n="120">Sail on , my captain , to the glorious end ,</l>
     <l n="121">And , though at first thou needs must sail alone</l>
     <l n="122">And undefended , ere that end be reached ,</l>
     <l n="123">When I shall give the word , nay , but one word ,</l>
     <l n="124">All England shall be up and after thee ,</l>
     <l n="125">The sword of England shall shine over thee ,</l>
     <l n="126">And round about thee like a guardian fire ;</l>
     <l n="127">All the great soul of England shall be there ;</l>
     <l n="128">Her mighty dead shall at that cry of doom</l>
     <l n="129">Rise from their graves and in God 's panoply</l>
     <l n="130">Plunge with our standards through immortal storms</l>
     <l n="131">When Drake rides out across the wreck of Rome .</l>
     <l n="132">As yet we must be cautious ; let no breath</l>
     <l n="133">Escape thee , save to thy most trusted friends ;</l>
     <l n="134">For now , if my lord Burleigh heard one word</l>
     <l n="135">Of all thou hast in mind , he is so much</l>
     <l n="136">The friend of caution and the beaten road ,</l>
     <l n="137">He would not rest till he had spilled thy hopes</l>
     <l n="138">And sealed thy doom ! Go now , fit out thy ships .</l>
     <l n="139">Walsingham is empowered to give thee gold</l>
     <l n="140">Immediately , but look to him for more</l>
     <l n="141">As thou shalt need it , gold and gold to spare ,</l>
     <l n="142">My golden-hearted pilot to the shores</l>
     <l n="143">Of victory — so farewell ; ” and through the gloom</l>
     <l n="144">She vanished as she came ; and Drake groped , dazed ,</l>
     <l n="145">Out through the doors , and found great Walsingham</l>
     <l n="146">Awaiting him with gold .</l>
     <l n="147">But in the room</l>
     <l n="148">Where Drake had held his converse with the Queen</l>
     <l n="149">The embroidered arras moved , and a lean face ,</l>
     <l n="150">White with its long eavesdropping upon death ,</l>
     <l n="151">Crept out and peered as a venomous adder peers</l>
     <l n="152">From out dark ferns , then as the reptile flashes</l>
     <l n="153">Along a path between two banks of flowers</l>
     <l n="154">Almost too swift for sight , a stealthy form</l>
     <l n="155">— One of the fifty spies whom Burleigh paid —</l>
     <l n="156">Passed down the gold-gloomed corridor to seek</l>
     <l n="157">His master , whom among great books he found ,</l>
     <l n="158">Calm , like a mountain brooding o'er the sea .</l>
     <l n="159">Nor did he break that calm for all these winds</l>
     <l n="160">Of rumour that now burst from out the sky .</l>
     <l n="161">His brow bent like a cliff over his thoughts ,</l>
     <l n="162">And the spy watched him half resentfully ,</l>
     <l n="163">Thinking his news well worth a blacker frown .</l>
     <l n="164">At last the statesman smiled and answered , “ Go ;</l>
     <l n="165">Fetch Thomas Doughty , Leicester 's secretary . ”</l>

     <l n="166">Few suns had risen and set ere Francis Drake</l>
     <l n="167">Had furnished forth his ships with guns and men ,</l>
     <l n="168">Tried seamen that he knew in storms of old ,—</l>
     <l n="169">Will Harvest , who could haul the ropes and fight</l>
     <l n="170">All day , and sing a foc'sle song to cheer</l>
     <l n="171">Sea-weary hearts at night ; brave old Tom Moone</l>

     <l n="174">And three-score trusty mariners , all scarred</l>
     <l n="175">And weather-beaten . After these there came</l>
     <l n="176">Some two-score gentleman adventurers ,</l>
     <l n="177">Gay college lads or lawyers that had grown</l>
     <l n="178">Sick of the dusty Temple , and were fired</l>
     <l n="179">With tales of the rich Indies and those tall</l>

     <l n="181">Laden with ingots and broad bars of gold .</l>

     <l n="183">Green birds of Guatemala , which they wore</l>
     <l n="184">On their slouched hats , tasting the high romance</l>
     <l n="185">And new-found colours of the world like wine .</l>
     <l n="186">By night they gathered in a marvellous inn</l>
     <l n="187">Beside the black and secret flowing Thames ;</l>
     <l n="188">And joyously they tossed the magic phrase</l>
     <l n="189">“ Pieces of eight ” from mouth to mouth , and laughed</l>
     <l n="190">And held the red wine up , night after night ,</l>
     <l n="191">Around their tables , toasting Francis Drake .</l>
     <l n="192">Among these came a courtier , and none knew</l>
     <l n="193">Or asked by whose approval , for each thought</l>
     <l n="194">Some other brought him ; yet he made his way</l>
     <l n="195">Cautiously , being a man with a smooth tongue ,</l>
     <l n="196">The secretary of Leicester ; and his name</l>
     <l n="197">Was Thomas Doughty . Most of all with Drake</l>
     <l n="198">He won his way to friendship , till at last</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">So on a misty grey December morn</l>
     <l n="2">Five ships put out from calm old Plymouth Sound ;</l>
     <l n="3">Five little ships , the largest not so large</l>
     <l n="4">As many a coasting yacht or fishing-trawl</l>
     <l n="5">To-day ; yet these must brave uncharted seas</l>
     <l n="6">Of unimagined terrors , haunted glooms ,</l>
     <l n="7">And shadowy horrors of an unknown world</l>
     <l n="8">Wild as primeval chaos . In the first ,</l>
     <l n="9">The Golden Hynde , a ship of eighteen guns ,</l>
     <l n="10">Drake sailed : John Wynter , a queen 's captain , next</l>
     <l n="11">Brought out the Elizabeth , a stout new ship</l>
     <l n="12">Of sixteen guns . The pinnace Christopher</l>
     <l n="13">Came next , in staunch command of old Tom Moone</l>
     <l n="14">Who , five years back , with reeking powder grimed ,</l>
     <l n="15">Off Cartagena fought against the stars</l>
     <l n="16">All night , and , as the sun arose in blood ,</l>
     <l n="17">Knee-deep in blood and brine , stood in the dark</l>
     <l n="18">Perilous hold and scuttled his own ship</l>
     <l n="19">The Swan , bidding her down to God 's great deep</l>
     <l n="20">Rather than yield her up a prize to Spain .</l>
     <l n="21">Lastly two gentleman-adventurers</l>
     <l n="22">Brought out the new Swan and the Marygold .</l>
     <l n="23">Their crews , all told , were eight score men and boys .</l>
     <l n="24">Not only terrors of the deep they braved ,</l>
     <l n="25">Bodiless witchcrafts of the black abyss ,</l>
     <l n="26">Red gaping mouths of hell and gulfs of fire</l>
     <l n="27">That yawned for all who passed the tropic line ;</l>
     <l n="28">But death lurked round them from their setting forth .</l>
     <l n="29">Mendoza , plenipotentiary of Spain ,</l>
     <l n="30">By spies informed , had swiftly warned his king ,</l>
     <l n="31">Who sent out mandates through his huge empire</l>
     <l n="32">From Gaudalchiber to the golden West</l>
     <l n="33">For the instant sinking of all English ships</l>
     <l n="34">And the instant execution of their crews</l>
     <l n="35">Who durst appear in the Caribbean sea .</l>
     <l n="36">Moreover , in the pith of their emprise</l>
     <l n="37">A peril lurked — Burleigh 's emissaries ,</l>
     <l n="38">The smooth-tongued Thomas Doughty , who had brought</l>
     <l n="39">His brother — unacquitted of that charge</l>
     <l n="40">Of poisoning , raised against him by the friends</l>
     <l n="41">Of Essex , but in luckless time released</l>
     <l n="42">Lately for lack of proof , on no strong plea .</l>
     <l n="43">These two wound through them like two snakes at ease</l>
     <l n="44">In Eden , waiting for their venomous hour .</l>
     <l n="45">Especially did Thomas Doughty toil</l>
     <l n="46">With soft and flowery tongue to win his way ;</l>
     <l n="47">And Drake , whose rich imagination craved</l>
     <l n="48">For something more than simple seaman 's talk ,</l>
     <l n="49">Was marvellously drawn to this new friend</l>

     <l n="51">The lawyer 's wit , the adventurer 's romance ,</l>
     <l n="52">Gold honey from the blooms of Euphues ,</l>
     <l n="53">Rare flashes from the Mermaid and sweet smiles</l>
     <l n="54">Copied from Sidney 's self , even to the glance</l>
     <l n="55">Of sudden , liquid sympathy , gave Drake</l>
     <l n="56">That banquet of the soul he ne'er had known</l>
     <l n="57">Nor needed till he knew , but needed now .</l>
     <l n="58">So to the light of Doughty 's answering eyes</l>
     <l n="59">He poured his inmost thoughts out , hour by hour ;</l>
     <l n="60">And Doughty coiled up in the heart of Drake .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="61">Against such odds the tiny fleet set sail ;</l>
     <l n="62">Yet gallantly and with heroic pride ,</l>
     <l n="63">Escutcheoned pavisades , emblazoned poops ,</l>
     <l n="64">Banners and painted shields and close-fights hung</l>
     <l n="65">With scarlet broideries . Every polished gun</l>
     <l n="66">Grinned through the jaws of some heraldic beast ,</l>
     <l n="67">Gilded and carven and gleaming with all hues ;</l>
     <l n="68">While in the cabin of the Golden Hynde</l>
     <l n="69">Rich perfumes floated , given by the great Queen</l>
     <l n="70">Herself to Drake as Captain-General ;</l>
     <l n="71">So that it seemed her soul was with the fleet ,</l>
     <l n="72">A presence to remind him , far away ,</l>
     <l n="73">Of how he talked with England , face to face ,—</l>
     <l n="74">No pirate he , but Gloriana 's knight .</l>
     <l n="75">Silver and gold his table furniture ,</l>
     <l n="76">Engraved and richly chased , lavishly gleamed</l>
     <l n="77">While , fanned by favouring airs , the ships advanced</l>
     <l n="78">With streaming flags and ensigns and sweet chords</l>
     <l n="79">Of music struck by skilled musicians</l>
     <l n="80">Whom Drake brought with him , not from vanity ,</l>
     <l n="81">But knowing how the pulse of men beats high</l>
     <l n="82">To music ; and the hearts of men like these</l>
     <l n="83">Were open to the high romance of earth ,</l>
     <l n="84">And they that dwelt so near God 's mystery</l>
     <l n="85">Were proud of their own manhood . They went out</l>
     <l n="86">To danger , as to a sweetheart , far away .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="87">Light as the sea-birds dipping their white wings</l>
     <l n="88">In foam before the gently heaving prows</l>
     <l n="89">Each heart beat , while the low soft lapping splash</l>
     <l n="90">Of water racing past them ripped and tore</l>
     <l n="91">Whiter and faster , and the bellying sails</l>
     <l n="92">Filled out , and the chalk cliffs of England sank</l>
     <l n="93">Dwindling behind the broad grey plains of sea .</l>
     <l n="94">Meekly content and tamely stay-at-home</l>
     <l n="95">The sea-birds seemed that piped across the waves ;</l>
     <l n="96">And Drake , be-mused , leaned smiling to his friend</l>
     <l n="97">Doughty and said , “ Is it not strange to know</l>
     <l n="98">When we return yon speckled herring-gulls</l>
     <l n="99">Will still be wheeling , dipping , flashing there ?</l>
     <l n="100">We shall not find a fairer land afar</l>
     <l n="101">Than those thyme-scented hills we leave behind !</l>
     <l n="102">Soon the young lambs will bleat across the combes ,</l>
     <l n="103">And breezes will bring puffs of hawthorn scent</l>
     <l n="104">Down Devon lanes ; over the purple moors</l>
     <l n="105">Lavrocks will carol ; and on the village greens</l>
     <l n="106">Around the May-pole , while the moon hangs low ,</l>
     <l n="107">The boys and girls of England merrily swing</l>
     <l n="108">In country footing through the morrice dance .</l>
     <l n="109">But many of us indeed shall not return . ”</l>
     <l n="110">Then the other with a laugh , “ Nay , like the man</l>
     <l n="111">Who slept a hundred years we shall return</l>
     <l n="112">And find our England strange : there are great storms</l>
     <l n="113">Brewing ; God only knows what we shall find —</l>
     <l n="114">Perchance a Spanish king upon the throne !</l>
     <l n="115">What then ? ” And Drake , “ I should put down my helm ,</l>
     <l n="116">And out once more to the unknown golden West</l>
     <l n="117">To die , as I have lived , in a free land . ”</l>
     <l n="118">So said he , while the white cliffs dwindled down ,</l>
     <l n="119">Faded , and vanished ; but the prosperous wind</l>
     <l n="120">Carried the five ships onward over the swell</l>
     <l n="121">Of swinging , sweeping seas , till the sun sank ,</l>
     <l n="122">And height o'er height the chaos of the skies</l>
     <l n="123">Broke out into the miracle of the stars .</l>
     <l n="124">Frostily glittering , all the Milky Way</l>
     <l n="125">Lay bare like diamond-dust upon the robe</l>
     <l n="126">Of some great king . Orion and the Plough</l>
     <l n="127">Glimmered through drifting gulfs of silver fleece ,</l>
     <l n="128">And , far away , in Italy , that night</l>
     <l n="129">Young Galileo , looking upward , heard</l>
     <l n="130">The self-same whisper through that wild abyss</l>
     <l n="131">Which now called Drake out to the unknown West .</l>
     <l n="132">But , after supper , Drake came up on deck</l>
     <l n="133">With Doughty , and on the cold poop as they leaned</l>
     <l n="134">And gazed across the rolling gleam and gloom</l>
     <l n="135">Of mighty muffled seas , began to give</l>
     <l n="136">Voices to those lovely captives of the brain</l>
     <l n="137">Which , like princesses in some forest-tower ,</l>
     <l n="138">Still yearn for the delivering prince , the sweet</l>
     <l n="139">Far bugle-note that calls from answering minds .</l>
     <l n="140">He told him how , in those dark days which now</l>
     <l n="141">Seemed like an evil dream , when the Princess</l>
     <l n="142">Elizabeth even trembled for her life</l>
     <l n="143">And read there , by the gleam of Smithfield fires ,</l>
     <l n="144">Those cunning lessons of diplomacy</l>
     <l n="145">Which saved her then and now for England 's sake ,</l>
     <l n="146">He passed his youth . ‘ Twas when the power of Spain</l>
     <l n="147">Began to light the gloom , with that great glare</l>
     <l n="148">Of martyrdom which , while the stars endure ,</l>
     <l n="149">Bears witness how men overcame the world ,</l>
     <l n="150">Trod the red flames beneath their feet like flowers ,</l>
     <l n="151">And cast aside the blackening robe of flesh ,</l>
     <l n="152">While with a crown of joy upon their heads ,</l>
     <l n="153">Even as into a palace , they passed through</l>
     <l n="154">The portals of the tomb to prove their love</l>
     <l n="155">Stronger at least than death : and , in those days</l>
     <l n="156">A Puritan , with iron in his soul ,</l>
     <l n="157">Having in earlier manhood occupied</l>
     <l n="158">His business in great waters and beheld</l>
     <l n="159">The bloody cowls of the Inquisition pass</l>
     <l n="160">Before the midnight moon as he kept watch ;</l>
     <l n="161">And having then forsworn the steely sea</l>
     <l n="162">To dwell at home in England with his love</l>
     <l n="163">At Tavistock in Devon , Edmund Drake</l>
     <l n="164">Began , albeit too near the Abbey walls ,</l>
     <l n="165">To speak too staunchly for his ancient faith ;</l>
     <l n="166">And with his young child Francis , had to flee</l>
     <l n="167">By night at last for shelter to the coast .</l>
     <l n="168">Little the boy remembered of that flight ,</l>
     <l n="169">Pillioned behind his father , save the clang</l>
     <l n="170">And clatter of the hoofs on stony ground</l>
     <l n="171">Striking a sharp blue fire , while country tales</l>
     <l n="172">Of highwaymen kindled his reckless heart</l>
     <l n="173">As the great steed went shouldering through the night .</l>
     <l n="174">There Francis , laying a little sunburnt hand</l>
     <l n="175">On the big bolstered pistol at each side ,</l>
     <l n="176">Dreamed with his wide grey eyes that he himself</l>
     <l n="177">Was riding out on some freebooting quest ,</l>
     <l n="178">And felt himself heroic . League by league</l>
     <l n="179">The magic world rolled past him as they rode ,</l>
     <l n="180">Leaving him nothing but a memory</l>
     <l n="181">Of his own making . Vaguely he perceived</l>
     <l n="182">A thousand meadows darkly streaming by</l>
     <l n="183">With clouds of perfume from their secret flowers ,</l>
     <l n="184">A wayside cottage-window pointing out</l>
     <l n="185">A golden finger o'er the purple road ;</l>
     <l n="186">A puff of garden roses or a waft</l>
     <l n="187">Of honeysuckle blown along a wood ,</l>
     <l n="188">While overhead that silver ship , the moon ,</l>
     <l n="189">Sailed slowly down the gulfs of glittering stars ,</l>
     <l n="190">Till , at the last , a buffet of fresh wind</l>
     <l n="191">Fierce with sharp savours of the stinging brine</l>
     <l n="192">Against his dreaming face brought up a roar</l>
     <l n="193">Of mystic welcome from the Channel seas .</l>
     <l n="194">And there Drake paused for a moment , as a song</l>
     <l n="195">Stole o'er the waters from the Marygold</l>
     <l n="196">Where some musician , striking luscious chords</l>
     <l n="197">Of sweet-stringed music , freed his heart 's desire</l>
     <l n="198">In symbols of the moment , which the rest ,</l>
     <l n="199">And Doughty among them , scarce could understand .</l>

     <l n="27">His own eternal hope and heart 's desire ,</l>
     <l n="28">Without belief , perchance , in Drake 's own quest —</l>
     <l n="29">To Drake 's own greater mind the eternal glory</l>
     <l n="30">Seemed to transfigure his immediate hope .</l>
     <l n="31">But Doughty only heard a sweet concourse</l>
     <l n="32">Of sounds . They ceased . And Drake resumed his tale</l>
     <l n="33">Of that strange flight in boyhood to the sea .</l>
     <l n="34">Next , the red-curtained inn and kindly hands</l>
     <l n="35">Of Protestant Plymouth held his memory long ;</l>
     <l n="36">Often in strange and distant dreams he saw</l>
     <l n="37">That scene which now he tenderly portrayed</l>
     <l n="38">To Doughty 's half-ironic smiling lips ,</l>
     <l n="39">Half-sympathetic eyes ; he saw again</l>
     <l n="40">That small inn parlour with the homely fare</l>
     <l n="41">Set forth upon the table , saw the gang</l>
     <l n="42">Of seamen dripping from the spray come in ,</l>
     <l n="43">Like great new thoughts to some adventurous brain .</l>
     <l n="44">Feeding his wide grey eyes he saw them stand</l>
     <l n="45">Around the crimson fire and stamp their feet</l>
     <l n="46">And scatter the salt drops from their big sea-boots ;</l>
     <l n="47">And all that night he lay awake and heard</l>
     <l n="48">Mysterious thunderings of eternal tides</l>
     <l n="49">Moaning out of a cold and houseless gloom</l>
     <l n="50">Beyond the world , that made it seem most sweet</l>
     <l n="51">To slumber in a little four-walled inn</l>
     <l n="52">Immune from all that vastness . But at dawn</l>
     <l n="53">He woke , he leapt from bed , he ran and lookt ,</l>
     <l n="54">There , through the tiny high bright casement , there ,—</l>
     <l n="55">O , fairy vision of that small boy 's face</l>
     <l n="56">Peeping at daybreak through the diamond pane !—</l>
     <l n="57">There first he saw the wondrous new-born world ,</l>
     <l n="58">And round its princely shoulders wildly flowing ,</l>
     <l n="59">Gemmed with a myriad clusters of the sun ,</l>
     <l n="60">The magic azure mantle of the sea .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="61">And , afterwards , there came those marvellous days</l>
     <l n="62">When , on that battleship , a disused hulk</l>
     <l n="63">Rotting to death in Chatham Reach , they found</l>
     <l n="64">Sanctuary and a dwelling-place at last .</l>
     <l n="65">For , Hawkins , that great ship-man , being their friend ,</l>
     <l n="66">A Protestant , with power on Plymouth town ,</l>
     <l n="67">Nigh half whereof he owned , made Edmund Drake</l>
     <l n="68">Reader of prayer to all the ships of war</l>
     <l n="69">That lay therein . So there the dreaming boy ,</l>
     <l n="70">Francis , grew up in that grim nursery</l>
     <l n="71">Among the ropes and masts and great dumb mouths</l>
     <l n="72">Of idle ordnance . In that hulk he heard</l>
     <l n="73">Many a time his father and his friends</l>
     <l n="74">Over some wild-eyed troop of refugees</l>
     <l n="75">Thunder against the powers of Spain and Rome ,</l>
     <l n="76">“ Idolaters who defiled the House of God</l>
     <l n="77">In England ; ” and all round them , as he heard ,</l>
     <l n="78">The clang and clatter of shipwright hammers rang ,</l>
     <l n="79">And hour by hour upon his vision rose ,</l>
     <l n="80">In solid oak reality , new ships ,</l>
     <l n="81">As Ilion rose to music , ships of war ,</l>
     <l n="82">The visible shapes and symbols of his dream ,</l>
     <l n="83">Unconscious yet , but growing as they grew ,</l>
     <l n="84">A wondrous incarnation , hour by hour ,</l>
     <l n="85">Till with their towering masts they stood complete ,</l>
     <l n="86">Embodied thoughts , in God 's own dockyards built ,</l>
     <l n="87">For Drake ere long to lead against the world .</l>

      <l n="49">England laughed as her queen drew nigh ,—</l>
      <l n="50">N'oserez vous , mon bel ami ?</l>

      <l n="52">Je vous en prie , pity me !</l>
      <l n="53">They drew her in with a joyful cry</l>
      <l n="54">To the hearth where she sits with a babe on her knee ,</l>
      <l n="55">She has turned her moan to a lullaby .</l>

      <l n="59">Such memories , on the plunging Golden Hynde ,</l>
      <l n="60">Under the stars , Drake drew before his friend ,</l>
      <l n="61">Clomb for a moment to that peak of vision ,</l>
      <l n="62">That purple peak of Darien , laughing aloud</l>
      <l n="63">O'er those wild exploits down to Rio Grande</l>
      <l n="64">Which even now had made his fierce renown</l>
      <l n="65">Terrible to all lonely ships of Spain .</l>
      <l n="66">E'en now , indeed , that poet of Portugal ,</l>
      <l n="67">Lope de Vega , filled with this new fear</l>
      <l n="68">Began to meditate his epic muse</l>
      <l n="69">Till , like a cry of panic from his lips ,</l>
      <l n="70">He shrilled the faint Dragontea forth , wherein</l>
      <l n="71">Drake is that Dragon of the Apocalypse ,</l>
      <l n="72">The dread Antagonist of God and Man .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="9">
      <l n="73">Well had it been for Doughty on that night</l>
      <l n="74">Had he not heard what followed ; for , indeed ,</l>
      <l n="75">When two minds clash , not often does the less</l>
      <l n="76">Conquer the greater ; but , without one thought</l>
      <l n="77">Of evil , seeing they now were safe at sea ,</l>
      <l n="78">Drake told him , only somewhat , yet too much ,</l>
      <l n="79">Of that close conference with the Queen . And lo ,</l>
      <l n="80">The face of Doughty blanched with a slow thought</l>
      <l n="81">That crept like a cold worm through all his brain ,</l>
      <l n="82">“ Thus much I knew , though secretly , before ;</l>
      <l n="83">But here he freely tells me as his friend ;</l>
      <l n="84">If I be false and he be what they say ,</l>
      <l n="85">His knowledge of my knowledge will mean death . ”</l>
      <l n="86">But Drake looked round at Doughty with a smile</l>
      <l n="87">And said , “ Forgive me now : thou art not used</l>
      <l n="88">To these cold nights at sea ! thou tremblest , friend ;</l>
      <l n="89">Let us go down and drink a cup of sack</l>
      <l n="90">To our return ! ” And at that kindly smile</l>
      <l n="91">Doughty shook off his nightmare mood , and thought ,</l>
      <l n="92">“ The yard-arm is for dogs , not gentlemen !</l>
      <l n="93">Even Drake would not misuse a man of birth ! ”</l>
      <l n="94">And in the cabin of the Golden Hynde</l>
      <l n="95">Revolving subtle treacheries he sat .</l>
      <l n="96">There with the sugared phrases of the court</l>
      <l n="97">Bartering beads for gold , he drew out all</l>
      <l n="98">The simple Devon seaman 's inmost heart ,</l>
      <l n="99">And coiled up in the soul of Francis Drake .</l>
      <l n="100">There in the solemn night they interchanged</l>
      <l n="101">Lies for sweet confidences . From one wall</l>
      <l n="102">The picture of Drake 's love looked down on him ;</l>
      <l n="103">And , like a bashful schoolboy 's , that bronzed face</l>
      <l n="104">Flushed as he blurted out with brightening eyes</l>
      <l n="105">And quickening breath how he had seen her first ,</l>
      <l n="106">Crowned on the village green , a Queen of May .</l>
      <l n="107">Her name , too , was Elizabeth , he said ,</l>
      <l n="108">As if it proved that she , too , was a queen ,</l>
      <l n="109">Though crowned with milk-white Devon may alone ,</l>
      <l n="110">And queen but of one plot of meadow-sweet .</l>
      <l n="111">As yet , he said , he had only kissed her hand ,</l>
      <l n="112">Smiled in her eyes and — there Drake also flinched ,</l>
      <l n="113">Thinking , “ I ne'er may see her face again . ”</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="10">
      <l n="114">And Doughty comforted his own dark heart</l>
      <l n="115">Thinking , “ I need not fear so soft a soul</l>
      <l n="116">As this ” ; and yet , he wondered how the man ,</l>
      <l n="117">Seeing his love so gripped him , none the less</l>
      <l n="118">Could leave her , thus to follow after dreams ;</l>
      <l n="119">For faith to Doughty was an unknown word ,</l>
      <l n="120">And trustfulness the property of fools .</l>
      <l n="121">At length they parted , each to his own couch ,</l>
      <l n="122">Doughty with half a chuckle , Francis Drake</l>
      <l n="123">With one old-fashioned richly grateful prayer</l>
      <l n="124">Blessing all those he loved , as he had learnt</l>
      <l n="125">Beside his mother 's knee in Devon days .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="11">
      <l n="126">So all night long they sailed ; but when a rift</l>
      <l n="127">Of orchard crimson broke the yellowing gloom</l>
      <l n="128">And barred the closely clouded East with dawn ,</l>
      <l n="129">Behold , a giant galleon , overhead ,</l>
      <l n="130">Lifting its huge black shining sides on high ,</l>
      <l n="131">Loomed like some misty monster of the deep :</l>
      <l n="132">And , sullenly rolling out great gorgeous folds ,</l>
      <l n="133">Over her rumbled like a thunder-cloud</l>
      <l n="134">The heavy flag of Spain . The splendid poop ,</l>
      <l n="135">Mistily lustrous as a dragon 's hoard</l>
      <l n="136">Seen in some magic cave-mouth o'er the sea</l>
      <l n="137">Through shimmering April sunlight after rain ,</l>
      <l n="138">Blazed to the morning ; and her port-holes grinned</l>
      <l n="139">With row on row of cannon . There at once</l>
      <l n="140">One sharp shrill whistle sounded , and those five</l>
      <l n="141">Small ships , mere minnows clinging to the flanks</l>
      <l n="142">Of that Leviathan , unseen , unheard ,</l>
      <l n="143">Undreamt of , grappled her . She seemed asleep ,</l>
      <l n="144">Swinging at ease with great half-slackened sails ,</l>
      <l n="145">Majestically careless of the dawn .</l>
      <l n="146">There in the very native seas of Spain ,</l>
      <l n="147">There with the yeast and foam of her proud cliffs ,</l>
      <l n="148">Her own blue coasts , in sight across the waves ,</l>
      <l n="149">Up her Titanic sides without a sound</l>
      <l n="150">The naked-footed British seamen swarmed</l>
      <l n="151">With knives between their teeth : then on her decks</l>
      <l n="152">They dropped like panthers , and the softly fierce</l>
      <l n="153">Black-bearded watch , of Spaniards , all amazed ,</l>
      <l n="154">Rubbing their eyes as if at a wild dream ,</l>
      <l n="155">Upraised a sudden shout , El Draque ! El Draque !</l>
      <l n="156">And flashed their weapons out , but all too late ;</l>
      <l n="157">For , ere their sleeping comrades reached the deck ,</l>
      <l n="158">The little watch , out-numbered and out-matched ,</l>
      <l n="159">Lay bound , and o'er the hatches everywhere</l>
      <l n="160">The points of naked cutlasses on guard</l>
      <l n="161">Gleamed , and without a struggle those below</l>
      <l n="162">Gave up their arms , their poignards jewelled thick</l>
      <l n="163">With rubies , and their blades of Spanish steel .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="12">
      <l n="164">Then onward o'er the great grey gleaming sea</l>
      <l n="165">They swept with their rich booty , night and day .</l>
      <l n="166">Five other prizes , one for every ship ,</l>
      <l n="167">Out of the seas of Spain they suddenly caught</l>
      <l n="168">And carried with them , laughing as they went —</l>
      <l n="169">“ Now , now indeed the Rubicon is crossed ;</l>
      <l n="170">Now have we singed the eyelids and the beard</l>
      <l n="171">Of Spain ; now have we roused the hornet 's nest ;</l>
      <l n="172">Now shall we sail against a world in arms ;</l>
      <l n="173">Now we have nought between us and black death</l>
      <l n="174">But our own hands , five ships , and three score guns . ”</l>
      <l n="175">So laughed they , plunging through the bay of storms ,</l>
      <l n="176">Biscay , and past Gibraltar , not yet clothed</l>
      <l n="177">With British thunder , though , as one might dream ,</l>
      <l n="178">Gazing in dim prophetic grandeur out</l>
      <l n="179">Across the waves while that small fleet went by ,</l>
      <l n="180">Or watching them with love 's most wistful fear</l>
      <l n="181">As they plunged Southward to the lonely coasts</l>
      <l n="182">Of Africa , till right in front up-soared ,</l>
      <l n="183">Tremendous over ocean , Teneriffe ,</l>
      <l n="184">Cloud-robed , but crowned with colours of the dawn .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="13">
      <l n="185">Already those two traitors were at work ,</l>
      <l n="186">Doughty and his false brother , among the crews ,</l>
      <l n="187">Who knew not yet the vastness of their quest ,</l>
      <l n="188">Nor dreamed of aught beyond the accustomed world ;</l>
      <l n="189">For Drake had kept it secret , and the thoughts</l>
      <l n="190">Of some that he had shipped before the mast</l>
      <l n="191">Set sail scarce farther than for Mogadore</l>
      <l n="192">In West Morocco , or at the utmost mark</l>
      <l n="193">For northern Egypt , by the midnight woods</l>
      <l n="194">And crystal palace roofed with chrysoprase</l>
      <l n="195">Where Prester John had reigned five hundred years ,</l>
      <l n="196">And Sydon , river of jewels , through the dark</l>
      <l n="197">Enchanted gorges rolled its rays along !</l>
      <l n="198">Some thought of Rio Grande ; but scarce to ten</l>
      <l n="199">The true intent was known ; while to divert</l>
      <l n="200">The rest from care the skilled musicians played .</l>
      <l n="201">But those two Doughtys cunningly devised</l>
      <l n="202">By chance-dropt words to breathe a hint abroad ;</l>
      <l n="203">And through the foc'sles crept a grisly fear</l>
      <l n="204">Of things that lay beyond the bourne of earth ,</l>
      <l n="205">Till even those hardy seamen almost quailed ;</l>
      <l n="206">And now , at any whisper , they might turn</l>
      <l n="207">With terror in their eyes . They might refuse</l>
      <l n="208">To sail into that fabled burning Void</l>
      <l n="209">Or brave that primum mobile which drew</l>
      <l n="210">O'erhYpppHeNdaring ships into the jaws of hell</l>
      <l n="211">Beyond the Pole Antarticke , where the sea</l>
      <l n="212">Rushed down through fiery mountains , and no sail</l>
      <l n="213">Could e'er return against its roaring stream .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="14">
      <l n="214">Now down the coast of Barbary they cruised</l>
      <l n="215">Till Christmas Eve embraced them in the heart</l>
      <l n="216">Of summer . In a bay of mellow calm</l>
      <l n="217">They moored , and as the fragrant twilight brought</l>
      <l n="218">The stars , the sound of song and dance arose ;</l>
      <l n="219">And down the shores in stealthy silence crept ,</l>
      <l n="220">Out of the massy forest 's emerald gloom ,</l>
      <l n="221">The naked , dark-limbed children of the night ,</l>
      <l n="222">Unseen , to gaze upon the floating glare</l>
      <l n="223">Of revelry ; unheard , to hear that strange</l>
      <l n="224">New music of the gods , where o'er the soft</l>
      <l n="225">Ripple and wash of the lanthorn-crimsoned tide</l>
      <l n="226">Will Harvest 's voice above the chorus rang .</l>

      <l n="25">Now to the Fortunate Islands of old time</l>
      <l n="26">They came , and found no glory as of old</l>
      <l n="27">Encircling them , no red ineffable calm</l>
      <l n="28">Of sunset round crowned faces pale with bliss</l>
      <l n="29">Like evening stars . Rugged and desolate</l>
      <l n="30">Those isles were when they neared them , though afar</l>
      <l n="31">They beautifully smouldered in the sun</l>
      <l n="32">Like dusky purple jewels fringed and frayed</l>
      <l n="33">With silver foam across that ancient sea .</l>
      <l n="34">Of wonder . On the largest of the seven</l>
      <l n="35">Drake landed Doughty with his musketeers</l>
      <l n="36">To exercise their weapons and to seek</l>
      <l n="37">Supplies among the matted uncouth huts</l>
      <l n="38">Which , as the ships drew round each ragged cliff ,</l>
      <l n="39">Crept like remembered misery into sight ;</l>
      <l n="40">Oh , like the strange dull waking from a dream</l>
      <l n="41">They blotted out the rosy courts and fair</l>
      <l n="42">Imagined marble thresholds of the King</l>
      <l n="43">Achilles and the heroes that were gone .</l>
      <l n="44">But Drake cared nought for these things . Such a heart</l>
      <l n="45">He had , to make each utmost ancient bourne</l>
      <l n="46">Of man 's imagination but a point</l>
      <l n="47">Of new departure for his Golden Dream .</l>
      <l n="48">But Doughty with his men ashore , alone ,</l>
      <l n="49">Among the sparse wind-bitten groves of palm ,</l>
      <l n="50">Kindled their fears of all they must endure</l>
      <l n="51">On that immense adventure . Nay , sometimes</l>
      <l n="52">He hinted of a voyage far beyond</l>
      <l n="53">All history and fable , far beyond</l>
      <l n="54">Even that Void whence only two returned ,—</l>
      <l n="55">Columbus , with his men in mutiny ;</l>
      <l n="56">Magellan , who could only hound his crew</l>
      <l n="57">Onward by threats of death , until they turned</l>
      <l n="58">In horror from the Threat that lay before ,</l>
      <l n="59">Preferring to be hanged as mutineers</l>
      <l n="60">Rather than venture farther . Nor indeed</l>
      <l n="61">Did even Magellan at the last return ;</l>
      <l n="62">But , with all hell around him , in the clutch</l>
      <l n="63">Of devils died upon some savage isle</l>
      <l n="64">By poisonous black enchantment . Not in vain</l>
      <l n="65">Were Doughty 's words on that volcanic shore</l>
      <l n="66">Among the stunted dark acacia trees ,</l>
      <l n="67">Whose heads , all bent one way by the trade-wind ,</l>
      <l n="68">Pointed North-east by North , South-west by West</l>
      <l n="69">Ambiguous sibyls that with wizened arms</l>
      <l n="70">Mysteriously declared a twofold path ,</l>
      <l n="71">Homeward or onward . But aboard the ships ,</l>
      <l n="72">Among the hardier seamen , old Tom Moone ,</l>
      <l n="73">With one or two stout comrades , overbore</l>
      <l n="74">All doubts and questionings with blither tales</l>
      <l n="75">Of how they sailed to Darien and heard</l>
      <l n="76">Nightingales in November all night long</l>
      <l n="77">As down a coast like Paradise they cruised</l>
      <l n="78">Through seas of lasting summer , Eden isles ,</l>
      <l n="79">Where birds like rainbows , butterflies like gems ,</l>
      <l n="80">And flowers like coloured fires o'er fairy creeks</l>
      <l n="81">Floated and flashed beneath the shadowy palms ;</l>
      <l n="82">While ever and anon a bark canoe</l>
      <l n="83">With naked Indian maidens flower-festooned</l>
      <l n="84">Put out from shadowy coves , laden with fruit</l>
      <l n="85">Ambrosial o'er the silken shimmering sea .</l>
      <l n="86">And once a troop of nut-brown maidens came —</l>
      <l n="87">So said Tom Moone , a twinkle in his eye —</l>
      <l n="88">Swimming to meet them through the warm blue waves</l>
      <l n="89">And wantoned through the water , like those nymphs</l>
      <l n="90">Which one green April at the Mermaid Inn</l>
      <l n="91">Should hear Kit Marlowe mightily portray ,</l>
      <l n="92">Among his boon companions , in a song</l>
      <l n="93">Of Love that swam the sparkling Hellespont</l>
      <l n="94">Upheld by nymphs , not lovelier than these ,—</l>
      <l n="95">Though whiter yet not lovelier than these —</l>
      <l n="96">For those like flowers , but these like rounded fruit</l>
      <l n="97">Rosily ripening through the clear tides tossed</l>
      <l n="98">From nut-brown breast and arm all round the ship</l>
      <l n="99">The thousand-coloured spray . Shapely of limb</l>
      <l n="100">They were ; but as they laid their small brown hands</l>
      <l n="101">Upon the ropes we cast them , Captain Drake</l>
      <l n="102">Suddenly thundered at them and bade them pack</l>
      <l n="103">For a troop of naughty wenches ! At that tale</l>
      <l n="104">A tempest of fierce laughter rolled around</l>
      <l n="105">The foc'sle ; but one boy from London town ,</l>
      <l n="106">A pale-faced prentice , run-away to sea ,</l>
      <l n="107">Asking why Drake had bidden them pack so soon ,</l>
      <l n="108">Tom Moone turned to him with his deep-sea growl ,</l>
      <l n="109">“ Because our Captain is no pink-eyed boy</l>
      <l n="110">Nor soft-limbed Spaniard , but a staunch-souled Man ,</l>
      <l n="111">Full-blooded ; nerved like iron ; with a girl</l>
      <l n="112">He loves at home in Devon ; and a mind</l>
      <l n="113">For ever bent upon some mighty goal ,</l>
      <l n="114">I know not what — but ‘ tis enough for me</l>
      <l n="115">To know my Captain knows . ” And then he told</l>
      <l n="116">How sometimes o'er the gorgeous forest gloom</l>
      <l n="117">Some marble city , rich , mysterious , white ,</l>
      <l n="118">An ancient treasure-house of Aztec kings ,</l>
      <l n="119">Or palace of forgotten Incas gleamed ;</l>
      <l n="120">And in their dim rich lofty cellars gold ,</l>
      <l n="121">Beyond all wildest dreams , great bars of gold ,</l>
      <l n="122">Like pillars , tossed in mighty chaos , gold</l>
      <l n="123">And precious stones , agate and emerald ,</l>
      <l n="124">Diamond , sapphire , ruby , and sardonyx .</l>
      <l n="125">So said he , as they waited the return</l>
      <l n="126">Of Doughty , resting in the foc'sle gloom ,</l>
      <l n="127">Or idly couched about the sun-swept decks</l>
      <l n="128">On sails or coils of rope , while overhead</l>
      <l n="129">Some boy would climb the rigging and look out ,</l>
      <l n="130">Arching his hand to see if Doughty came .</l>
      <l n="131">But when he came , he came with a strange face</l>
      <l n="132">Of feigned despair ; and with a stammering tongue</l>
      <l n="133">He vowed he could not find those poor supplies</l>
      <l n="134">Which Drake himself in other days had found</l>
      <l n="135">Upon that self-same island . But , perchance ,</l>
      <l n="136">This was a barren year , he said . And Drake</l>
      <l n="137">Looked at him , suddenly , and at the musketeers .</l>
      <l n="138">Their eyes were strained ; their faces wore a cloud .</l>
      <l n="139">That night he said no more ; but on the morn ,</l>
      <l n="140">Mistrusting nothing , Drake with subtle sense</l>
      <l n="141">Of weather-wisdom , through that little fleet</l>
      <l n="142">Distributed his crews anew . And all</l>
      <l n="143">The prisoners and the prizes at those isles</l>
      <l n="144">They left behind them , taking what they would</l>
      <l n="145">From out their carven cabins ,— glimmering silks ,</l>
      <l n="146">Chiselled Toledo blades , and broad doubloons .</l>
      <l n="147">And lo , as they weighed anchor , far away</l>
      <l n="148">Behind them on the blue horizon line</l>
      <l n="149">It seemed a city of towering masts arose ;</l>
      <l n="150">And from the crow 's nest of the Golden Hynde</l>
      <l n="151">A seaman cried , “ By God ; the hunt is up ! ”</l>
      <l n="152">And like a tide of triumph through their veins</l>
      <l n="153">The red rejoicing blood began to race</l>
      <l n="154">As there they saw the avenging ships of Spain ,</l>
      <l n="155">Eight mighty galleons , nosing out their trail .</l>
      <l n="156">And Drake growled , “ Oh , my lads of Bideford ,</l>
      <l n="157">It cuts my heart to show the hounds our heels ;</l>
      <l n="158">But we must not emperil our great quest !</l>
      <l n="159">Such fights as that must wait — as our reward</l>
      <l n="160">When we return . Yet I will not put on</l>
      <l n="161">One stitch of sail . So , lest they are not too slow</l>
      <l n="162">To catch us , clear the decks . God , I would like</l>
      <l n="163">To fight them ! ” So the little fleet advanced</l>
      <l n="164">With decks all cleared and shotted guns and men</l>
      <l n="165">Bare-armed beside them , hungering to be caught ,</l>
      <l n="166">And quite distracted from their former doubts ;</l>
      <l n="167">For danger , in that kind , they never feared .</l>
      <l n="168">But soon the heavy Spaniards dropped behind ;</l>
      <l n="169">And not in vain had Thomas Doughty sown</l>
      <l n="170">The seeds of doubt ; for many a brow grew black</l>
      <l n="171">With sullen-seeming care that erst was gay .</l>
      <l n="172">But happily and in good time there came ,</l>
      <l n="173">Not from behind them now , but right in front ,</l>
      <l n="174">On the first sun-down of their quest renewed ,</l>
      <l n="175">Just as the sea grew dark around their ships ,</l>
      <l n="176">A chance that loosed heart-gnawing doubt in deeds .</l>
      <l n="177">For through a mighty zone of golden haze</l>
      <l n="178">Blotting the purple of the gathering night</l>
      <l n="179">A galleon like a floating mountain moved</l>
      <l n="180">To meet them , clad with sunset and with dreams .</l>
      <l n="181">Her masts and spars immense in jewelled mist</l>
      <l n="182">Shimmered : her rigging , like an emerald web</l>
      <l n="183">Of golden spiders , tangled half the stars !</l>
      <l n="184">Embodied sunset , dragging the soft sky</l>
      <l n="185">O'er dazzled ocean , through the night she drew</l>
      <l n="186">Out of the unknown lands ; and round a prow</l>
      <l n="187">That jutted like a moving promontory</l>
      <l n="188">Over a cloven wilderness of foam ,</l>
      <l n="189">Upon a lofty blazoned scroll her name</l>
      <l n="190">San Salvador challenged obsequious isles</l>
      <l n="191">Where'er she rode ; who kneeling like dark slaves</l>
      <l n="192">Before some great Sultàn must lavish forth</l>
      <l n="193">From golden cornucopias , East and West ,</l>
      <l n="194">Red streams of rubies , cataracts of pearl .</l>
      <l n="195">But , at a signal from their admiral , all</l>
      <l n="196">Those five small ships lay silent in the gloom</l>
      <l n="197">Which , just as if some god were on their side ,</l>
      <l n="198">Covered them in the dark troughs of the waves ,</l>
      <l n="199">Letting her pass to leeward . On she came ,</l>
      <l n="200">Blazing with lights , a City of the Sea ,</l>
      <l n="201">Belted with crowding towers and clouds of sail ,</l>
      <l n="202">And round her bows a long-drawn thunder rolled</l>
      <l n="203">Splendid with foam ; but ere she passed them by</l>
      <l n="204">Drake gave the word , and with one crimson flash</l>
      <l n="205">Two hundred yards of black and hidden sea</l>
      <l n="206">Leaped into sight between them as the roar</l>
      <l n="207">Of twenty British cannon shattered the night .</l>
      <l n="208">Then after her they drove , like black sea-wolves</l>
      <l n="209">Behind some royal high-branched stag of ten ,</l>
      <l n="210">Hanging upon those bleeding foam-flecked flanks ,</l>
      <l n="211">Leaping , snarling , worrying , as they went</l>
      <l n="212">In full flight down the wind ; for those light ships</l>
      <l n="213">Much speedier than their huge antagonist ,</l>
      <l n="214">Keeping to windward , worked their will with her .</l>
      <l n="215">In vain she burnt wild lights and strove to scan</l>
      <l n="216">The darkening deep . Her musketeers in vain</l>
      <l n="217">Provoked the crackling night with random fires :</l>
      <l n="218">In vain her broadside bellowings burst at large</l>
      <l n="219">As if the Gates of Erebus unrolled .</l>
      <l n="220">For ever and anon the deep-sea gloom</l>
      <l n="221">From some new quarter , like a dragon 's mouth</l>
      <l n="222">Opened and belched forth crimson flames and tore</l>
      <l n="223">Her sides as if with iron claws unseen ;</l>
      <l n="224">Till , all at once , rough voices close at hand</l>
      <l n="225">Out of the darkness thundered , “ Grapple her ! ”</l>
      <l n="226">And , falling on their knees , the Spaniards knew</l>
      <l n="227">The Dragon of that red Apocalypse .</l>
      <l n="228">There with one awful cry , El Draque ! El Draque !</l>
      <l n="229">They cast their weapons from them ; for the moon</l>
      <l n="230">Rose , eastward , and , against her rising , black</l>
      <l n="231">Over the bloody bulwarks , Francis Drake ,</l>
      <l n="232">Grasping the great hilt of his naked sword ,</l>
      <l n="233">Towered for a moment to their startled eyes</l>
      <l n="234">Through all the zenith like the King of Hell .</l>
      <l n="235">Then he leaped down upon their shining decks ,</l>
      <l n="236">And after him swarmed and towered and leapt in haste</l>
      <l n="237">A brawny band of three score Englishmen ,</l>
      <l n="238">Gigantic as they loomed against the sky</l>
      <l n="239">And risen , it seemed , by miracle from the sea .</l>
      <l n="240">So small were those five ships below the walls</l>
      <l n="241">Of that huge floating mountain . Royally</l>
      <l n="242">Drake , from the swart commander 's trembling hands</l>
      <l n="243">Took the surrendered sword , and bade his men</l>
      <l n="244">Gather the fallen weapons on an heap ,</l>
      <l n="245">And placed a guard about them , while the moon</l>
      <l n="246">Silvering the rolling seas for many a mile</l>
      <l n="247">Glanced on the huddled Spaniards ’ rich attire ,</l>
      <l n="248">As like one picture of despair they grouped</l>
      <l n="249">Under the splintered main-mast 's creaking shrouds ,</l>
      <l n="250">And the great swinging shadows of the sails</l>
      <l n="251">Mysteriously swept the gleaming decks ;</l>
      <l n="252">Where many a butt of useless cannon gloomed</l>
      <l n="253">Along the accoutred bulwarks or upturned ,</l>
      <l n="254">As the ship wallowed in the heaving deep ,</l>
      <l n="255">Dumb mouths of empty menace to the stars .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="4">
      <l n="256">Then Drake appointed Doughty , with a guard ,</l>
      <l n="257">To sail the prize on to the next dim isle</l>
      <l n="258">Where they might leave her , taking aught they would</l>
      <l n="259">From out her carven cabins and rich holds .</l>
      <l n="260">And Doughty 's heart leaped in him as he thought ,</l>
      <l n="261">“ I have my chance at last ” ; but Drake , who still</l>
      <l n="262">Trusted the man , made surety doubly sure ,</l>
      <l n="263">And in his wary weather-wisdom sent</l>
      <l n="264">— Even as a breathing type of friendship , sent —</l>
      <l n="265">His brother , Thomas Drake , aboard the prize ;</l>
      <l n="266">But set his brother , his own flesh and blood ,</l>
      <l n="267">Beneath the man , as if to say , “ I give</l>
      <l n="268">My loyal friend dominion over me . ”</l>
      <l n="269">So courteously he dealt with him ; but he ,</l>
      <l n="270">Seeing his chance once more slipping away ,</l>
      <l n="271">Raged inwardly and , from his own false heart</l>
      <l n="272">Imputing his own evil , he contrived</l>
      <l n="273">A cunning charge that night ; and when they came</l>
      <l n="274">Next day , at noon , upon the destined isle ,</l>
      <l n="275">He suddenly spat the secret venom forth ,</l>
      <l n="276">With such fierce wrath in his defeated soul</l>
      <l n="277">That he himself almost believed the charge .</l>
      <l n="278">For when Drake stepped on the San Salvador</l>
      <l n="279">To order all things duly about the prize ,</l>
      <l n="280">What booty they must keep and what let go ,</l>
      <l n="281">Doughty received him with a blustering voice</l>
      <l n="282">Of red mock-righteous wrath , “ Is this the way</l>
      <l n="283">Englishmen play the pirate , Francis Drake ?</l>
      <l n="284">While thou wast dreaming of thy hero 's crown —</l>
      <l n="285">God save the mark !— thy brother , nay , thy spy ,</l>
      <l n="286">Must play the common pilferer , must convert</l>
      <l n="287">The cargo to his uses , rob us all</l>
      <l n="288">Of what we risked our necks to win : he wears</l>
      <l n="289">The ransom of an emperor round his throat</l>
      <l n="290">That might enrich us all . Who saw him wear</l>
      <l n="291">That chain of rubies ere last night ? ”</l>
      <l n="292">And Drake ,</l>
      <l n="293">“ Answer him , brother ; ” and his brother smiled</l>
      <l n="294">And answered , “ Nay , I never wore this chain</l>
      <l n="295">Before last night ; but Doughty knows , indeed ,</l>
      <l n="296">For he was with me — and none else was there</l>
      <l n="297">But Doughty — ‘ tis my word against his word ,</l>
      <l n="298">That close on midnight we were summoned down</l>
      <l n="299">To an English seaman who lay dying below</l>
      <l n="300">Unknown to any of us , a prisoner</l>
      <l n="301">In chains , that had been captured none knew where ,</l>
      <l n="302">For all his mind was far from Darien ,</l>
      <l n="303">And wandering evermore through Devon lanes</l>
      <l n="304">At home ; whom we released ; and from his waist</l>
      <l n="305">He took this hidden chain and gave it me ,</l>
      <l n="306">Begging me that if ever I returned</l>
      <l n="307">To Bideford in Devon I would go</l>
      <l n="308">With whatsoever wealth it might produce</l>
      <l n="309">To his old mother who , with wrinkled hands</l>
      <l n="310">In some small white-washed cottage o'er the sea ,</l>
      <l n="311">Where wall-flowers bloom in April , even now</l>
      <l n="312">Is turning pages of the well-worn Book</l>
      <l n="313">And praying for her son 's return , nor knows</l>
      <l n="314">That he lies cold upon the heaving main .</l>
      <l n="315">But this he asked ; and this in all good faith</l>
      <l n="316">I swore to do ; and even now he died ,</l>
      <l n="317">And hurrying hither from his side I clasped</l>
      <l n="318">His chain of rubies round my neck awhile ,</l>
      <l n="319">In full sight of the sun . I have no more</l>
      <l n="320">To say . ” Then up spoke Hatton 's trumpeter :</l>
      <l n="321">“ But I have more to say . Last night I saw</l>
      <l n="322">Doughty , but not in full sight of the sun ,</l>
      <l n="323">Nor once , nor twice , but three times at the least ,</l>
      <l n="324">Carrying chains of gold , clusters of gems ,</l>
      <l n="325">And whatsoever wealth he could convey</l>
      <l n="326">Into his cabin and smuggle in smallest space . ”</l>
      <l n="327">“ Nay , ” Doughty stammered , mixing sneer and lie ,</l>
      <l n="328">Yet bolstering up his courage with the thought</l>
      <l n="329">That being what courtiers called a gentleman</l>
      <l n="330">He ranked above the rude sea-discipline ,</l>
      <l n="331">“ Nay , they were free gifts from the Spanish crew</l>
      <l n="332">Because I treated them with courtesy . ”</l>
      <l n="333">Then bluff Will Harvest , “ That perchance were true ,</l>
      <l n="334">For he hath been close closeted for hours</l>
      <l n="335">With their chief officers , drinking their health</l>
      <l n="336">In our own war-bought wine , while down below</l>
      <l n="337">Their captured English seaman groaned his last . ”</l>
      <l n="338">Then Drake , whose utter silence , with a sense</l>
      <l n="339">Of infinite power and justice , ruled their hearts ,</l>
      <l n="340">Suddenly thundered — and the traitor blanched</l>
      <l n="341">And quailed before him . “ This my flesh and blood</l>
      <l n="342">I placed beneath thee as my dearer self !</l>
      <l n="343">But thou , in trampling on him , shalt not say</l>
      <l n="344">I charged thy brother . Nay , thou chargest me !</l>
      <l n="345">Against me only hast thou stirred this strife ;</l>
      <l n="346">And now , by God , shalt thou learn , once for all ,</l>
      <l n="347">That I , thy captain for this voyage , hold</l>
      <l n="348">The supreme power of judgment in my hands .</l>
      <l n="349">Get thee aboard my flagship ! When I come</l>
      <l n="350">I shall have more to say to thee ; but thou ,</l>
      <l n="351">My brother , take this galleon in thy charge ;</l>
      <l n="352">For , as I see , she holdeth all the stores</l>
      <l n="353">Which Doughty failed to find . She shall return</l>
      <l n="354">With us to that New World from which she came .</l>
      <l n="355">But now let these our prisoners all embark</l>
      <l n="356">In yonder pinnace ; let them all go free .</l>
      <l n="357">I care not to be cumbered on my way</l>
      <l n="358">Through dead Magellan 's unattempted dream</l>
      <l n="359">With chains and prisoners . In that Golden World</l>
      <l n="360">Which means much more to me than I can speak ,</l>
      <l n="361">Much more , much more than I can speak or breathe ,</l>
      <l n="362">Being , behind whatever name it bears —</l>
      <l n="363">Earthly Paradise , Island of the Saints ,</l>
      <l n="364">Cathay , or Zipangu , or Hy Brasil —</l>
      <l n="365">The eternal symbol of my soul 's desire ,</l>
      <l n="366">A sacred country shining on the sea ,</l>
      <l n="367">That Vision without which , the wise king said ,</l>
      <l n="368">A people perishes ; in that place of hope ,</l>
      <l n="369">That Tirn'an Og , that land of lasting youth ,</l>
      <l n="370">Where whosoever sails with me shall drink</l>
      <l n="371">Fountains of immortality and dwell</l>
      <l n="372">Beyond the fear of death for evermore ,</l>
      <l n="373">There shall we see the dust of battle dance</l>
      <l n="374">Everywhere in the sunbeam of God 's peace !</l>
      <l n="375">Oh , in the new Atlantis of my soul</l>
      <l n="376">There are no captives : there the wind blows free ;</l>
      <l n="377">And , as in sleep , I have heard the marching song</l>
      <l n="378">Of mighty peoples rising in the West ,</l>
      <l n="379">Wonderful cities that shall set their foot</l>
      <l n="380">Upon the throat of all old tyrannies ;</l>
      <l n="381">And on the West wind I have heard a cry ,</l>
      <l n="382">The shoreless cry of the prophetic sea</l>
      <l n="383">Heralding through that golden wilderness</l>
      <l n="384">The Soul whose path our task is to make straight ,</l>
      <l n="385">Freedom , the last great Saviour of mankind .</l>
      <l n="386">I know not what I know : these are wild words ,</l>
      <l n="387">Which , as the sun draws out earth 's morning mists</l>
      <l n="388">Over dim fields where careless cattle sleep ,</l>
      <l n="389">Some visionary Light , unknown , afar ,</l>
      <l n="390">Draws from my darkling soul . Why should we drag</l>
      <l n="391">Thither this Old-World weight of utter gloom ,</l>
      <l n="392">Or with the ballast of these heavy hearts</l>
      <l n="393">Make sail in sorrow for Pacific Seas ?</l>
      <l n="394">Let us leave chains and prisoners to Spain ;</l>
      <l n="395">But set these free to make their own way home ! ”</l>
      <l n="396">So said he , groping blindly towards the truth ,</l>
      <l n="397">And heavy with the treason of his friend .</l>
      <l n="398">His face was like a king 's face as he spake ,</l>
      <l n="399">For sorrows that strike deep reveal the deep ;</l>
      <l n="400">And through the gateways of a raggèd wound</l>
      <l n="401">Sometimes a god will drive his chariot wheels</l>
      <l n="402">From some deep heaven within the hearts of men .</l>
      <l n="403">Nevertheless , the immediate seamen there</l>
      <l n="404">Knowing how great a ransom they might ask</l>
      <l n="405">For some among their prisoners , men of wealth</l>
      <l n="406">And high degree , scarce liked to free them thus ;</l>
      <l n="407">And only saw in Drake 's conflicting moods</l>
      <l n="408">The moment 's whim . “ For little will he care , ”</l>
      <l n="409">They muttered , “ when we reach those fabled shores ,</l>
      <l n="410">Whether his cannon break their golden peace . ”</l>
      <l n="411">Yet to his face they murmured not at all ;</l>
      <l n="412">Because his eyes compelled them like a law .</l>
      <l n="413">So there they freed the prisoners and set sail</l>
      <l n="414">Across the earth-shaking shoulders of the broad</l>
      <l n="415">Atlantic , and the great grey slumbrous waves</l>
      <l n="416">Triumphantly swelled up to meet the keels .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Now in the cabin of the Golden Hynde</l>
     <l n="2">At dusk , Drake sent for Doughty . From one wall</l>
     <l n="3">The picture of his love looked down on him ;</l>
     <l n="4">And on the table lay the magic chart ,</l>
     <l n="5">Drawn on a buffalo horn , all small peaked isles ,</l>
     <l n="6">Dwarf promontories , tiny twisted creeks ,</l>
     <l n="7">And fairy harbours under elfin hills ,</l>
     <l n="8">With marvellous inscriptions lined in red ,—</l>
     <l n="9">As Here is Gold , or Many Rubies Here ,</l>
     <l n="10">Or Ware Witch-crafte , or Here is Cannibals .</l>
     <l n="11">For in his great simplicity the man</l>
     <l n="12">Delighted in it , with the adventurous heart</l>
     <l n="13">Of boyhood poring o'er some well-thumbed tale</l>
     <l n="14">On blue Twelfth Night beside the crimson fire ;</l>
     <l n="15">And o'er him , like a vision of a boy</l>
     <l n="16">In his first knighthood when , upon some hill</l>
     <l n="17">Washed by the silver fringes of the sea ,</l>
     <l n="18">Amidst the purple heather he lies and reads</l>
     <l n="19">Of Arthur and Avilion , like a star</l>
     <l n="20">His love 's pure face looked down . There Doughty came ,</l>
     <l n="21">Half fearful , half defiant , with a crowd</l>
     <l n="22">Of jostling half-excuses on his lips ,</l>
     <l n="23">And one dark swarm of adders in his heart .</l>
     <l n="24">For now what light of chivalry remained</l>
     <l n="25">In Doughty 's mind was thickening with a plot ,</l>
     <l n="26">Subtler and deadlier than the serpent 's first</l>
     <l n="27">Attempt on our first sire in Eden bower .</l>
     <l n="28">Drake , with a countenance open as the sun ,</l>
     <l n="29">Received him , saying : “ Forgive me , friend , for I</l>
     <l n="30">Was hasty with thee . I well nigh forgot</l>
     <l n="31">Those large and liberal nights we two have passed</l>
     <l n="32">In this old cabin , telling all our dreams</l>
     <l n="33">And hopes , in friendship , o'er and o'er again .</l>
     <l n="34">But Vicary , thy friend hath talked with me ,</l>
     <l n="35">And now — I understand . Thou shalt no more</l>
     <l n="36">Be vexed with a divided mastership .</l>
     <l n="37">Indeed , I trust thee , Doughty . Wilt thou not</l>
     <l n="38">Be friends with me ? For now in ample proof</l>
     <l n="39">Thou shalt take charge of this my Golden Hynde</l>
     <l n="40">In all things , save of seamanship , which rests</l>
     <l n="41">With the ship 's master under my command .</l>
     <l n="42">But I myself will sail upon the prize . ”</l>
     <l n="43">And with the word he gathered up the chart ,</l>
     <l n="44">Took down his lady 's picture with a smile ,</l>
     <l n="45">Gripped Doughty 's hand and left him , staring , sheer</l>
     <l n="46">Bewildered with that magnanimity</l>
     <l n="47">Of faith , throughout all shadows , in some light</l>
     <l n="48">Unseen behind the shadows . Thus did Drake</l>
     <l n="49">Give up his own fair cabin which he loved ;</l>
     <l n="50">Being , it seemed , a little travelling home ,</l>
     <l n="51">Fragrant with memories ,— gave it , as he thought ,</l>
     <l n="52">In recompense to one whom he had wronged .</l>
     <l n="53">For even as his mind must ever yearn</l>
     <l n="54">To shores beyond the sunset , even so</l>
     <l n="55">He yearned through all dark shadows to his friend ,</l>
     <l n="56">And with his greater nature striving still</l>
     <l n="57">To comprehend the lesser , as the sky</l>
     <l n="58">Embraces our low earth , he would adduce</l>
     <l n="59">Justifications , thus : “ These men of law</l>
     <l n="60">Are trained to plead for any and every cause ,</l>
     <l n="61">To feign an indignation , or to prove</l>
     <l n="62">The worse is better and that black is white !</l>
     <l n="63">Small wonder that their passion goes astray :</l>
     <l n="64">There is one prayer , one prayer for all of us —</l>
     <l n="65">Enter not into judgment with Thy servant ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="66">Yet as his boat pulled tow'rd the Spanish prize</l>
     <l n="67">Leaving the Golden Hynde , far off he heard</l>
     <l n="68">A voice that chilled him , as the voice of Fate</l>
     <l n="69">Crying like some old Bellman through the world .</l>

     <l n="17">And Doughty , though Drake 's deed of kindness flashed</l>
     <l n="18">A moment 's kind contrition through his heart ,</l>
     <l n="19">Immediately , with all his lawyer 's wit</l>
     <l n="20">True to the cause that hired him , laughed it by ,</l>
     <l n="21">And straight began to weave the treacherous web</l>
     <l n="22">Of soft intrigue wherein he meant to snare</l>
     <l n="23">The passions of his comrades . Night and day ,</l>
     <l n="24">As that small fleet drove onward o'er the deep ,</l>
     <l n="25">Cleaving the sunset with their bright black prows</l>
     <l n="26">Or hunted by the red pursuing Dawn ,</l>
     <l n="27">He stirred between the high-born gentlemen</l>
     <l n="28">( Whose white and jewelled hands , gallant in fight ,</l>
     <l n="29">And hearts remembering Crécy and Poictiers ,</l>
     <l n="30">Were of scant use in common seamanship ) ,</l>
     <l n="31">Between these and the men whose rough tarred arms</l>
     <l n="32">Were good at equal need in storm or war</l>
     <l n="33">Yet took a poorer portion of the prize ,</l>
     <l n="34">He stirred a subtle jealousy and fanned</l>
     <l n="35">A fire that swiftly grew almost to hate .</l>
     <l n="36">For when the seamen must take precedence</l>
     <l n="37">Of loiterers on the deck — through half a word ,</l>
     <l n="38">Small , with intense device , like some fierce lens ,</l>
     <l n="39">He magnified their rude and blustering mode ;</l>
     <l n="40">Or urged some scented fop , whose idle brain</l>
     <l n="41">Busied itself with momentary whims ,</l>
     <l n="42">To bid the master alter here a sail ,</l>
     <l n="43">Or there a rope ; and , if the man refused ,</l>
     <l n="44">Doughty , at night , across the wine-cups , raved</l>
     <l n="45">Against the rising insolence of the mob ;</l>
     <l n="46">And hinted Drake himself was half to blame ,</l>
     <l n="47">In words that seemed to say , “ I am his friend ,</l>
     <l n="48">Or I should bid you think him all to blame . ”</l>
     <l n="49">So fierce indeed the strife became that once ,</l>
     <l n="50">While Chester , Doughty 's catspaw , played with fire ,</l>
     <l n="51">The grim ship-master growled between his teeth ,</l>
     <l n="52">“ Remember , sir , remember , ere too late ,</l>
     <l n="53">Magellan 's mutinous vice-admiral 's end . ”</l>
     <l n="54">And Doughty heard , and with a boisterous laugh</l>
     <l n="55">Slapped the old sea-dog on the back and said ,</l>
     <l n="56">“ The gallows are for dogs , not gentlemen ! ”</l>
     <l n="57">Meanwhile his brother , sly John Doughty , sought</l>
     <l n="58">To fan the seamen 's fear of the unknown world</l>
     <l n="59">With whispers and conjectures ; and , at night ,</l>
     <l n="60">He brought old books of Greek and Hebrew down</l>
     <l n="61">Into the foc'sle , claiming by their aid</l>
     <l n="62">A knowledge of Black Art , and power to tell</l>
     <l n="63">The future , which he dreadfully displayed</l>
     <l n="64">There in the flickering light of the oily lamp ,</l>
     <l n="65">Bending above their huge and swarthy palms</l>
     <l n="66">And tracing them to many a grisly doom .</l>
     <l n="67">So many a night and day westward they plunged .</l>
     <l n="68">The half-moon ripened to its mellow round ,</l>
     <l n="69">Dwindled again and ripened yet again ,</l>
     <l n="70">And there was nought around them but the grey</l>
     <l n="71">Ruin and roar of huge Atlantic seas .</l>
     <l n="72">And only like a memory of the world</l>
     <l n="73">They left behind them rose the same great sun ,</l>
     <l n="74">And daily rolled his chariot through their sky ,</l>
     <l n="75">Whereof the skilled musicians made a song .</l>

     <l n="58">With milk-white arms up-binding golden clouds</l>
     <l n="59">Of fragrant hair behind her lovely head ;</l>
     <l n="60">And lo , before the bright black plunging prows</l>
     <l n="61">The whole sea suddenly shattered into shoals</l>
     <l n="62">Of rolling porpoises . Everywhere they tore</l>
     <l n="63">The glittering water . Like a moving crowd</l>
     <l n="64">Of black bright rocks washed smooth by foaming tides ,</l>
     <l n="65">They thrilled the unconscious fancy of the crews</l>
     <l n="66">With subtle , wild , and living hints of land .</l>
     <l n="67">And soon Columbus ’ happy signals came ,</l>
     <l n="68">The signs that saved him when his mutineers</l>
     <l n="69">Despaired at last and clamoured to return ,—</l>
     <l n="70">And there , with awe triumphant in their eyes ,</l>
     <l n="71">They saw , lazily tossing on the tide ,</l>
     <l n="72">A drift of seaweed , and a berried branch ,</l>
     <l n="73">Which silenced them as if they had seen a Hand</l>
     <l n="74">Writing with fiery letters on the deep ,</l>
     <l n="75">Then a black cormorant , vulture of the sea ,</l>
     <l n="76">With neck outstretched and one long ominous honk ,</l>
     <l n="77">Went hurtling past them to its unknown bourne .</l>
     <l n="78">A mighty white-winged albatross came next ;</l>
     <l n="79">Then flight on flight of clamorous clanging gulls ;</l>
     <l n="80">And last , a wild and sudden shout of “ Land ! ”</l>
     <l n="81">Echoed from crew to crew across the waves .</l>
     <l n="82">Then , dumb upon the rigging as they hung</l>
     <l n="83">Staring at it , a menace chilled their blood .</l>
     <l n="84">For like Il Gran Nemico of Dante , dark ,</l>
     <l n="85">Ay , coloured like a thunder-cloud , from North</l>
     <l n="86">To South , in front , there slowly rose to sight</l>
     <l n="87">A country like a dragon fast asleep</l>
     <l n="88">Along the West , with wrinkled , purple wings</l>
     <l n="89">Ending in ragged forests o'er its spine ;</l>
     <l n="90">And with great craggy claws out-thrust , that turned</l>
     <l n="91">( As the dire distances dissolved their veils )</l>
     <l n="92">To promontories bounding a huge bay .</l>
     <l n="93">There o'er the hushed and ever shallower tide</l>
     <l n="94">The staring ships drew nigh and thought , “ Is this</l>
     <l n="95">The Dragon of our Golden Apple Tree ,</l>
     <l n="96">The guardian of the fruit of our desire</l>
     <l n="97">Which grows in gardens of the Hesperides</l>
     <l n="98">Where those three sisters weave a white-armed dance</l>
     <l n="99">Around it everlastingly , and sing</l>
     <l n="100">Strange songs in a strange tongue that still convey</l>
     <l n="101">Warning to heedful souls ? ” Nearer they drew ,</l>
     <l n="102">And now , indeed , from out a soft blue-grey</l>
     <l n="103">Mingling of colours on that coast 's deep flank</l>
     <l n="104">There crept a garden of enchantment , height</l>
     <l n="105">O'er height , a garden sloping from the hills ,</l>
     <l n="106">Wooded as with Aladdin 's trees that bore</l>
     <l n="107">All-coloured clustering gems instead of fruit ;</l>
     <l n="108">Now vaster as it grew upon their eyes ,</l>
     <l n="109">And like some Roman amphitheatre</l>
     <l n="110">Cirque above mighty cirque all round the bay ,</l>
     <l n="111">With jewels and flowers ablaze on women 's breasts</l>
     <l n="112">Innumerably confounded and confused ;</l>
     <l n="113">While lovely faces flushed with lust of blood ,</l>
     <l n="114">Rank above rank upon their tawny thrones</l>
     <l n="115">In soft barbaric splendour lapped , and lulled</l>
     <l n="116">By the low thunderings of a thousand lions ,</l>
     <l n="117">Luxuriously smiled as they bent down</l>
     <l n="118">Over the scarlet-splashed and steaming sands</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="120">Such fears and dreams for Francis Drake , at least ,</l>
     <l n="121">Rose and dissolved in his nigh fevered brain</l>
     <l n="122">As they drew near that equatorial shore ;</l>
     <l n="123">For rumours had been borne to him ; and now</l>
     <l n="124">He knew not whether to impute the wrong</l>
     <l n="125">To his untrustful mind or to believe</l>
     <l n="126">Doughty a traitorous liar ; yet there seemed</l>
     <l n="127">Proof and to spare . A thousand shadows rose</l>
     <l n="128">To mock him with their veiled indicative hands .</l>
     <l n="129">And each alone he laid and exorcised</l>
     <l n="130">But for each doubt he banished , one returned</l>
     <l n="131">From darker depths to mock him o'er again .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="132">So , in that bay , the little fleet sank sail</l>
     <l n="133">And anchored ; and the wild reality</l>
     <l n="134">Behind those dreams towered round them on the hills ,</l>
     <l n="135">Or so it seemed . And Drake bade lower a boat ,</l>
     <l n="136">And went ashore with sixteen men to seek</l>
     <l n="137">Water ; and , as they neared the embowered beach ,</l>
     <l n="138">Over the green translucent tide there came ,</l>
     <l n="139">A hundred yards from land , a drowsy sound</l>
     <l n="140">Immeasurably repeated and prolonged ,</l>
     <l n="141">As of innumerable elfin drums</l>
     <l n="142">Dreamily mustering in the tropic bloom .</l>
     <l n="143">This from without they heard , across the waves ;</l>
     <l n="144">But when they glided into a flowery creek</l>
     <l n="145">Under the sharp black shadows of the trees —</l>
     <l n="146">Jaca and Mango and Palm and red festoons</l>
     <l n="147">Of garlanded Liana wreaths — it ebbed</l>
     <l n="148">Into the murmur of the mighty fronds ,</l>
     <l n="149">Prodigious leaves whose veinings bore the fresh</l>
     <l n="150">Impression of the finger-prints of God .</l>
     <l n="151">There humming-birds , like flakes of purple fire</l>
     <l n="152">Upon some passing seraph 's plumage , beat</l>
     <l n="153">And quivered in blinding blots of golden light</l>
     <l n="154">Between the embattled cactus and cardoon ;</l>
     <l n="155">While one huge whisper of primeval awe</l>
     <l n="156">Seemed to await the cool green eventide</l>
     <l n="157">When God should walk His Garden as of old .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="158">Now as the boats were plying to and fro</l>
     <l n="159">Between the ships and that enchanted shore ,</l>
     <l n="160">Drake bade his comrades tarry a little and went</l>
     <l n="161">Apart , alone , into the trackless woods .</l>
     <l n="162">Tormented with his thoughts , he saw all round</l>
     <l n="163">Once more the battling image of his mind ,</l>
     <l n="164">Where there was nought of man , only the vast</l>
     <l n="165">Unending silent struggle of Titan trees ,</l>
     <l n="166">Large internecine twistings of the world ,</l>
     <l n="167">The hushed death-grapple and the still intense</l>
     <l n="168">Locked anguish of Laocoons that gripped</l>
     <l n="169">Death by the throat for thrice three hundred years ,</l>
     <l n="170">Once , like a subtle mockery overhead ,</l>
     <l n="171">Some black-armed chattering ape swung swiftly by ,</l>
     <l n="172">But he strode onward , thinking — “ Was it false ,</l>
     <l n="173">False all that kind outreaching of the hands ?</l>
     <l n="174">False ? Was there nothing certain , nothing sure</l>
     <l n="175">In those divinest aisles and towers of Time</l>
     <l n="176">Wherein we took sweet counsel ? Is there nought</l>
     <l n="177">Sure but the solid dust beneath our feet ?</l>
     <l n="178">Must all those lovelier fabrics of the soul ,</l>
     <l n="179">Being so divinely bright and delicate ,</l>

     <l n="183">No bitterer than some idle love-lorn maid</l>
     <l n="184">Sheds for her dead canary . God , it hurts ,</l>
     <l n="185">This , this hurts most , to think how we must miss</l>
     <l n="186">What might have been , for nothing but a breath ,</l>
     <l n="187">A babbling of the tongue , an argument ,</l>
     <l n="188">Or such a poor contention as involves</l>
     <l n="189">The thrones and dominations of this earth ,—</l>
     <l n="190">How many of us , like seed on barren ground ,</l>

     <l n="196">Now , wandering upward ever , he reached and clomb</l>
     <l n="197">The slope side of a fern-fringed precipice ,</l>
     <l n="198">And , at the summit , found an opening glade ,</l>
     <l n="199">Whence , looking o'er the forest , he beheld</l>
     <l n="200">The sea ; and , in the land-locked bay below ,</l>
     <l n="201">Far , far below , his elfin-tiny ships ,</l>
     <l n="202">All six at anchor on the crawling tide !</l>
     <l n="203">Then onward , upward , through the woods once more</l>
     <l n="204">He plunged with bursting heart and burning brow ;</l>
     <l n="205">And , once again , like madness , the black shapes</l>
     <l n="206">Of doubt swung through his brain and chattered and laughed ,</l>
     <l n="207">Till he upstretched his arms in agony</l>
     <l n="208">And cursed the name of Doughty , cursed the day</l>
     <l n="209">They met , cursed his false face and courtier smiles ,</l>
     <l n="210">“ For oh , ” he cried , “ how easy a thing it were</l>
     <l n="211">For truth to wear the garb of truth ! This proves</l>
     <l n="212">His treachery ! ” And there , at once , his thoughts</l>
     <l n="213">Tore him another way , as thus , “ And yet</l>
     <l n="214">If he were false , is he not subtle enough</l>
     <l n="215">To hide it ? Why , this proves his innocence —</l>

     <l n="217">Black-hearted evil-thinker as I am ,</l>
     <l n="218">In my own clumsier spirit so misjudge !</l>
     <l n="219">These children of the court are butterflies</l>

     <l n="221">Would fix them to a stem and call them flowers ,</l>
     <l n="222">Nay , bid them grasp the ground like towering oaks</l>
     <l n="223">And shadow all the zenith ; ” and yet again</l>
     <l n="224">The madness of distrustful friendship gleamed</l>
     <l n="225">From his fierce eyes , “ Oh villain , damnèd villain ,</l>
     <l n="226">God 's murrain on his heart ! I know full well</l>
     <l n="227">He hides what he can hide ! He wears no fault</l>
     <l n="228">Upon the gloss and frippery of his breast !</l>
     <l n="229">It is not that ! It is the hidden things ,</l>

     <l n="231">Ay , it is these , these , these and these alone</l>
     <l n="232">That I mistrust . ”</l>
     <l n="233">And , as he walked , the skies</l>
     <l n="234">Grew full of threats , and now enormous clouds</l>
     <l n="235">Rose mammoth-like above the ensanguined deep ,</l>
     <l n="236">Trampling the daylight out ; and , with its death</l>
     <l n="237">Dyed purple , rushed along as if they meant</l>
     <l n="238">To obliterate the world . He took no heed .</l>
     <l n="239">Though that strange blackness brimmed the branching aisles</l>
     <l n="240">With horror , he strode on till in the gloom ,</l>
     <l n="241">Just as his winding way came out once more</l>
     <l n="242">Over a precipice that o'erlooked the bay ,</l>
     <l n="243">There , as he went , not gazing down , but up ,</l>
     <l n="244">He saw what seemed a ponderous granite cliff ,</l>
     <l n="245">A huge ribbed shell upon a lonely shore</l>
     <l n="246">Left by forgotten mountains when they sank</l>
     <l n="247">Back to earth 's breast like billows on a sea .</l>
     <l n="248">A tall and whispering crowd of tree-ferns waved</l>
     <l n="249">Mysterious fringes round it . In their midst</l>
     <l n="250">He flung himself at its broad base , with one</l>
     <l n="251">Sharp shivering cry of pain , “ Show me Thy ways ,</l>
     <l n="252">O God , teach me Thy paths ! I am in the dark !</l>
     <l n="253">Lighten my darkness ! ”</l>
     <l n="254">Almost as he spoke</l>
     <l n="255">There swept across the forest , far and wide ,</l>
     <l n="256">Gathering power and volume as it came ,</l>
     <l n="257">A sound as of a rushing mighty wind ;</l>
     <l n="258">And , overhead , like great black gouts of blood</l>
     <l n="259">Wrung from the awful forehead of the Night</l>
     <l n="260">The first drops fell and ceased . Then , suddenly ,</l>
     <l n="261">Out of the darkness , earth with all her seas ,</l>
     <l n="262">Her little ships at anchor in the bay</l>
     <l n="263">( Five ebony ships upon a sheet of silver ,</l>
     <l n="264">Drake saw not that , indeed , Drake saw not that ! ) ,</l>
     <l n="265">Her woods , her boughs , her leaves , her tiniest twigs .</l>
     <l n="266">Leapt like a hunted stag through one immense</l>
     <l n="267">Lightning of revelation into the murk</l>
     <l n="268">Of Erebus : then heaven o'er rending heaven</l>
     <l n="269">Shattered and crashed down ruin over the world .</l>
     <l n="270">But , in that deeper darkness , Francis Drake</l>
     <l n="271">Stood upright now , and with blind outstretched arms</l>
     <l n="272">Groped at that strange forgotten cliff and shell</l>
     <l n="273">Of mystery ; for in that flash of light</l>
     <l n="274">Æons had passed ; and now the Thing in front</l>
     <l n="275">Made his blood freeze with memories that lay</l>
     <l n="276">Behind his Memory . In the gloom he groped ,</l>
     <l n="277">And with dark hands that knew not what they knew ,</l>
     <l n="278">As one that shelters in the night , unknowing ,</l>
     <l n="279">Beneath a stranded shipwreck , with a cry</l>
     <l n="280">He touched the enormous rain-washed belted ribs</l>
     <l n="281">And bones like battlements of some Mastodon</l>
     <l n="282">Embedded there until the trump of doom .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="283">After long years , long centuries , perchance ,</l>
     <l n="284">Triumphantly some other pioneer</l>
     <l n="285">Would stand where Drake now stood and read the tale</l>
     <l n="286">Of ages where he only felt the cold</l>
     <l n="287">Touch in the dark of some huge mystery ;</l>
     <l n="288">Yet Drake might still be nearer to the light</l>
     <l n="289">Who now was whispering from his great deep heart ,</l>
     <l n="290">“ Show me Thy ways , O God , teach me Thy paths ! ”</l>
     <l n="291">And there by some strange instinct , oh , he felt</l>
     <l n="292">God 's answer there , as if he grasped a hand</l>
     <l n="293">Across a gulf of twice ten thousand years ;</l>
     <l n="294">And he regained his lost magnificence</l>
     <l n="295">Of faith in that great Harmony which resolves</l>
     <l n="296">Our discords , faith through all the ruthless laws</l>
     <l n="297">Of nature in their lovely pitilessness ,</l>
     <l n="298">Faith in that Love which outwardly must wear ,</l>
     <l n="299">Through all the sorrows of eternal change ,</l>
     <l n="300">The splendour of the indifference of God .</l>
     <l n="301">All round him through the heavy purple gloom</l>
     <l n="302">Sloped the soft rush of silver-arrowed rain ,</l>
     <l n="303">Loosening the skies ’ hard anguish , as with tears .</l>
     <l n="304">Once more he felt his unity with all</l>
     <l n="305">The vast composure of the universe ,</l>
     <l n="306">And drank deep at the fountains of that peace</l>
     <l n="307">Which comprehends the tumult of our days .</l>
     <l n="308">But with that peace the power to act returned ;</l>
     <l n="309">And , with his back against the Mastodon ,</l>
     <l n="310">He stared through the great darkness tow'rds the sea .</l>
     <l n="311">The rain ceased for a moment : only the slow</l>
     <l n="312">Drip of the dim droop-feathered palms all round</l>
     <l n="313">Deepened the hush .</l>
     <l n="314">Then , out of the gloom once more</l>
     <l n="315">The whole earth leapt to sight with all her woods ,</l>
     <l n="316">Her boughs , her leaves , her tiniest twigs distinct</l>
     <l n="317">For one wild moment ; but Drake only saw</l>
     <l n="318">The white flash of her seas and there , oh there</l>
     <l n="319">That land-locked bay with those five elfin ships ,</l>
     <l n="320">Five elfin ebony ships upon a sheet</l>
     <l n="321">Of wrinkled silver ! Then , as the thunder followed ,</l>
     <l n="322">One thought burst through his brain —</l>
     <l n="323">One ship was gone !</l>
     <l n="324">Over the grim precipitous edge he hung ,</l>
     <l n="325">An eagle waiting for the lightning now</l>
     <l n="326">To swoop upon his prey . One iron hand</l>
     <l n="327">Gripped a rough tree-root like a bunch of snakes ;</l>
     <l n="328">And , as the rain rushed round him , far away</l>
     <l n="329">He saw to northward yet another flash ,</l>
     <l n="330">A scribble of God 's finger in the sky</l>
     <l n="331">Over a waste of white stampeding waves .</l>
     <l n="332">His eye flashed like a falchion as he saw it ,</l>
     <l n="333">And from his lips there burst the sea-king 's laugh ;</l>
     <l n="334">For there , with a fierce joy he knew , he knew</l>
     <l n="335">Doughty , at last — an open mutineer !</l>
     <l n="336">An open foe to fight ! Ay , there she went ,—</l>
     <l n="337">His Golden Hynde , his little Golden Hynde</l>
     <l n="338">A wild deserter scudding to the North .</l>
     <l n="339">And , almost ere the lightning , Drake had gone</l>
     <l n="340">Crashing down the face of the precipice ,</l>
     <l n="341">By a narrow water-gully , and through the huge</l>
     <l n="342">Forest he tore the straight and perilous way</l>
     <l n="343">Down to the shore ; while , three miles to the North ,</l>
     <l n="344">Upon the wet poop of the Golden Hynde</l>
     <l n="345">Doughty stood smiling . Scarce would he have smiled</l>
     <l n="346">Knowing that Drake had seen him from that tower</l>
     <l n="347">Amidst the thunders ; but , indeed , he thought</l>
     <l n="348">He had escaped unseen amidst the storm .</l>
     <l n="349">Many a day he had worked upon the crew ,</l>
     <l n="350">Fanning their fears and doubts until he won</l>
     <l n="351">The more part to his side . And when they reached</l>
     <l n="352">That coast , he showed them how Drake meant to sail</l>
     <l n="353">Southward , into that unknown Void ; but he</l>
     <l n="354">Would have them suddenly slip by stealth away</l>
     <l n="355">Northward to Darien , showing them what a life</l>
     <l n="356">Of roystering glory waited for them there ,</l>
     <l n="357">If , laying aside this empty quest , they joined</l>
     <l n="358">The merry feasters round those island fires</l>
     <l n="359">Which over many a dark-blue creek illumed</l>
     <l n="360">Buccaneer camps in scarlet logwood groves ,</l>
     <l n="361">Fringing the Gulf of Mexico , till dawn</l>
     <l n="362">Summoned the Black Flags out to sweep the sea .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="363">But when Drake reached the flower-embowered boat</l>
     <l n="364">And found the men awaiting his return</l>
     <l n="365">There , in a sheltering grove of bread-fruit trees</l>
     <l n="366">Beneath great eaves of leafage that obscured</l>
     <l n="367">Their sight , but kept the storm out , as they tossed</l>
     <l n="368">Pieces of eight or rattled the bone dice ,</l>
     <l n="369">His voice went through them like a thunderbolt ,</l>
     <l n="370">For none of them had seen the Golden Hynde</l>
     <l n="371">Steal from the bay ; and now the billows burst</l>
     <l n="372">Like cannon down the coast ; and they had thought</l>
     <l n="373">Their boat could not be launched until the storm</l>
     <l n="374">Abated . Under Drake 's compelling eyes ,</l>
     <l n="375">Nevertheless , they poled her down the creek</l>
     <l n="376">Without one word , waiting their chance . Then all</l>
     <l n="377">Together with their brandished oars they thrust ,</l>
     <l n="378">And on the fierce white out-draught of a wave</l>
     <l n="379">They shot up , up and over the toppling crest</l>
     <l n="380">Of the next , and plunged crashing into the trough</l>
     <l n="381">Behind it : then they settled at their thwarts ,</l>
     <l n="382">And the fierce water boiled before their blades</l>
     <l n="383">As , with Drake 's iron hand upon the helm ,</l>
     <l n="384">They soared and crashed across the rolling seas .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="385">Not for the Spanish prize did Drake now steer ,</l>
     <l n="386">But for that little ship the Marygold ,</l>
     <l n="387">Swiftest of sail , next to the Golden Hynde ,</l>
     <l n="388">And , in the hands of Francis Drake , indeed</l>
     <l n="389">Swiftest of all ; and ere the seamen knew</l>
     <l n="390">What power , as of a wind , bore them along ,</l>
     <l n="391">Anchor was up , their hands were on the sheets ,</l>
     <l n="392">The sails were broken out , the Marygold</l>
     <l n="393">Was flying like a storm-cloud to the North ,</l>
     <l n="394">And on her poop an iron statue still</l>
     <l n="395">As death stood Francis Drake .</l>
     <l n="396">One hour they rushed</l>
     <l n="397">Northward , with green seas washing o'er the deck</l>
     <l n="398">And buffeted with splendour ; then they saw</l>
     <l n="399">The Golden Hynde like some wing-broken gull</l>
     <l n="400">With torn mismanaged plumes beating the air</l>
     <l n="401">In peril of utter shipwreck ; saw her fly</l>
     <l n="402">Half-mast , a feeble signal of distress</l>
     <l n="403">Despite all Doughty 's curses ; for her crew</l>
     <l n="404">Wild with divisions torn amongst themselves</l>
     <l n="405">Most gladly now surrendered in their hearts ,</l>
     <l n="406">As close alongside grandly onward swept</l>
     <l n="407">The Marygold , with canvas trim and taut</l>
     <l n="408">Magnificently drawing the full wind ,</l>
     <l n="409">Her gunners waiting at their loaded guns</l>
     <l n="410">Bare-armed and silent ; and that iron soul</l>
     <l n="411">Alone , upon her silent quarter-deck .</l>
     <l n="412">There they hauled up into the wind and lay</l>
     <l n="413">Rocking , while Drake , alone , without a guard ,</l>
     <l n="414">Boarding the runaway , dismissed his boat</l>
     <l n="415">Back to the Marygold . Then his voice out-rang</l>
     <l n="416">Trumpet-like o'er the trembling mutineers ,</l>
     <l n="417">And clearly , as if they were but busied still</l>
     <l n="418">About the day 's routine . They hid their shame ,</l>
     <l n="419">As men that would propitiate a god ,</l>
     <l n="420">By flying to fulfil his lightest word ;</l>
     <l n="421">And ere they knew what power , as of a wind ,</l>
     <l n="422">Impelled them — that half wreck was trim and taut ,</l>
     <l n="423">Her sails all drawing and her bows afoam ;</l>
     <l n="424">And , creeping past the Marygold once more ,</l>
     <l n="425">She led their Southward way ! And not till then</l>
     <l n="426">Did Drake vouchsafe one word to the white face</l>
     <l n="427">Of Doughty , as he furtively slunk nigh</l>
     <l n="428">With some new lie upon his fear-parched lips</l>
     <l n="429">Thirsting for utterance in his crackling laugh</l>
     <l n="430">Of deprecation ; and with one ruffling puff</l>
     <l n="431">Of pigeon courage in his blinded soul —</l>
     <l n="432">“ I am no sea-dog — even Francis Drake</l>
     <l n="433">Would scarce misuse a gentleman . ”</l>
     <l n="434">Then Drake turned</l>
     <l n="435">And summoned four swart seamen out by name .</l>
     <l n="436">His words went like a cold wind through their flesh</l>
     <l n="437">As with a passionless voice he slowly said ,</l>
     <l n="438">“ Take ye this fellow : bind him to the mast</l>
     <l n="439">Until what time I shall decide his fate . ”</l>
     <l n="440">And Doughty gasped as at the world 's blank end ,—</l>
     <l n="441">“ Nay , Francis , ” cried he , “ wilt thou thus misuse</l>
     <l n="442">A gentleman ? ” But as the seamen gripped</l>
     <l n="443">His arms he struggled vainly and furiously</l>
     <l n="444">To throw them off ; and in his impotence</l>
     <l n="445">Let slip the whole of his treacherous cause and hope</l>
     <l n="446">In empty wrath ,— “ Fore God , ” he foamed and snarled ,</l>
     <l n="447">“ Ye shall all smart for this when we return !</l>
     <l n="448">Unhand me , dogs ! I have Lord Burleigh 's power</l>
     <l n="449">Behind me . There is nothing I have done</l>
     <l n="450">Without his warrant ! Ye shall smart for this !</l>
     <l n="451">Unhand me , I say , unhand me ! ”</l>
     <l n="452">And in one flash</l>
     <l n="453">Drake saw the truth , and Doughty saw his eyes</l>
     <l n="454">Lighten upon him ; and his false heart quailed</l>
     <l n="455">Once more ; and he suddenly suffered himself</l>
     <l n="456">Quietly , strangely , to be led away</l>
     <l n="457">And bound without a murmur to the mast .</l>
     <l n="458">And strangely Drake remembered , as those words ,</l>
     <l n="459">“ Ye shall all smart for this when we return , ”</l>
     <l n="460">Yelped at his faith , how while the Dover cliffs</l>
     <l n="461">Faded from sight he leaned to his new friend</l>
     <l n="462">Doughty and said : “ I blame them not who stay !</l>
     <l n="463">I blame them not at all who cling to home ,</l>
     <l n="464">For many of us , indeed , shall not return ,</l>
     <l n="465">Nor ever know that sweetness any more . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="466">And when they had reached their anchorage anew ,</l>
     <l n="467">Drake , having now resolved to bring his fleet</l>
     <l n="468">Beneath a more compact control , at once</l>
     <l n="469">Took all the men and the chief guns and stores</l>
     <l n="470">From out the Spanish prize ; and sent Tom Moone</l>
     <l n="471">To set the hulk afire . Also he bade</l>
     <l n="472">Unbind the traitor and ordered him aboard</l>
     <l n="473">The pinnace Christopher . John Doughty , too ,</l>
     <l n="474">He ordered thither , into the grim charge</l>
     <l n="475">Of old Tom Moone , thinking it best to keep</l>
     <l n="476">The poisonous leaven carefully apart</l>
     <l n="477">Until they had won well Southward , to a place</l>
     <l n="478">Where , finally committed to their quest ,</l>
     <l n="479">They might arraign the traitor without fear</l>
     <l n="480">Or favour , and acquit him or condemn .</l>
     <l n="481">But those two brothers , doubting as the false</l>
     <l n="482">Are damned to doubt , saw murder in his eyes ,</l>
     <l n="483">And thought “ He means to sink the smack one night . ”</l>
     <l n="484">And they refused to go , till Drake abruptly</l>
     <l n="485">Ordered them straightway to be slung on board</l>
     <l n="486">With ropes .</l>
     <l n="487">The daylight waned ; but ere the sun</l>
     <l n="488">Sank , the five ships were plunging to the South ;</l>
     <l n="489">For Drake would halt no longer , least the crows</l>
     <l n="490">Also should halt betwixt two purposes .</l>
     <l n="491">He took the tide of fortune at the flood ;</l>
     <l n="492">And onward through the now subsiding storm ,</l>
     <l n="493">Ere they could think what power as of a wind</l>
     <l n="494">Impelled them , he had swept them on their way .</l>
     <l n="495">Far , far into the night they saw the blaze</l>
     <l n="496">That leapt in crimson o'er the abandoned hulk</l>
     <l n="497">Behind them , like a mighty hecatomb</l>
     <l n="498">Marking the path of some Titanic will .</l>
     <l n="499">Many a night and day they Southward drove .</l>
     <l n="500">Sometimes at midnight round them all the sea</l>
     <l n="501">Quivered with witches ’ oils and water snakes ,</l>
     <l n="502">Green , blue , and red , with lambent tongues of fire .</l>
     <l n="503">Mile upon mile about the blurred black hulls</l>
     <l n="504">A cauldron of tempestuous colour coiled .</l>
     <l n="505">On every mast mysterious meteors burned ,</l>
     <l n="506">And from the shores a bellowing rose and fell</l>
     <l n="507">As of great bestial gods that walked all night</l>
     <l n="508">Through some wild hell unknown , too vast for men ;</l>
     <l n="509">But when the silver and crimson of the dawn</l>
     <l n="510">Broke out , they saw the tropic shores anew ,</l>
     <l n="511">The fair white foam , and , round about the rocks ,</l>
     <l n="512">Weird troops of tusked sea-lions ; and the world</l>
     <l n="513">Mixed with their dreams and made them stranger still .</l>
     <l n="514">And , once , so fierce a tempest scattered the fleet</l>
     <l n="515">That even the hardiest souls began to think</l>
     <l n="516">There was a Jonah with them ; for the seas</l>
     <l n="517">Rose round them like green mountains , peaked and rigged</l>
     <l n="518">With heights of Alpine snow amongst the clouds ;</l>
     <l n="519">And many a league to Southward , when the ships</l>
     <l n="520">Gathered again amidst the sinking waves</l>
     <l n="521">Four only met . The ship of Thomas Drake</l>
     <l n="522">Was missing ; and some thought it had gone down</l>
     <l n="523">With all hands in the storm . But Francis Drake</l>
     <l n="524">Held on his way , learning from hour to hour</l>
     <l n="525">To merge himself in immortality ;</l>
     <l n="526">Learning the secrets of those pitiless laws</l>
     <l n="527">Which dwarf all mortal grief , all human pain ,</l>
     <l n="528">To something less than nothing by the side</l>
     <l n="529">Of that eternal travail dimly guessed ,</l>
     <l n="530">Since first he felt in the miraculous dark</l>
     <l n="531">The great bones of the Mastodon , that hulk</l>
     <l n="532">Of immemorial death . He learned to judge</l>
     <l n="533">The passing pageant of this outward world</l>
     <l n="534">As by the touch-stone of that memory ;</l>
     <l n="535">Even as in that country which some said</l>
     <l n="536">Lay now not far , the great Tezcucan king ,</l>
     <l n="537">Resting his jewelled hand upon a skull ,</l>
     <l n="538">And on a smouldering glory of jewels throned</l>
     <l n="539">There in his temple of the Unknown God</l>
     <l n="540">Over the host of Aztec princes , clad</l>
     <l n="541">In golden hauberks gleaming under soft</l>
     <l n="542">Surcoats of green or scarlet feather-work ,</l>
     <l n="543">Could in the presence of a mightier power</l>
     <l n="544">Than life or death , give up his guilty sons ,</l>
     <l n="545">His only sons , to the sacrificial sword .</l>
     <l n="546">And hour by hour the soul of Francis Drake ,</l>
     <l n="547">Unconscious as an oak-tree of its growth ,</l>
     <l n="548">Increased in strength and stature as he drew</l>
     <l n="549">Earth , heaven , and hell within him , more and more .</l>
     <l n="550">For as the dream we call our world , with all</l>
     <l n="551">Its hues is but a picture in the brain ,</l>
     <l n="552">So did his soul enfold the universe</l>
     <l n="553">With gradual sense of superhuman power ,</l>
     <l n="554">While every visible shape within the vast</l>
     <l n="555">Horizon seemed the symbol of some , thought</l>
     <l n="556">Waiting for utterance . He had found indeed</l>
     <l n="557">God 's own Nirvana , not of empty dream ,</l>
     <l n="558">But of intensest life . Nor did he think</l>
     <l n="559">Aught of all this ; but , as the rustic deems</l>
     <l n="560">The colours that he carries in his brain</l>
     <l n="561">Are somehow all outside him while he peers</l>
     <l n="562">Unaltered through two windows in his face ,</l>
     <l n="563">Drake only knew that as the four ships plunged</l>
     <l n="564">Southward , the world mysteriously grew</l>
     <l n="565">More like a prophet 's vision , hour by hour ,</l>
     <l n="566">Fraught with dark omens and significances ,</l>
     <l n="567">A world of hieroglyphs and sacred signs</l>
     <l n="568">Wherein he seemed to read the truth that lay</l>
     <l n="569">Hid from the Roman augurs when of old</l>
     <l n="570">They told the future from the flight of birds .</l>
     <l n="571">How vivid with disaster seemed the flight</l>
     <l n="572">Of those blood-red flamingoes o'er the dim</l>
     <l n="573">Blue steaming forest , like two terrible thoughts</l>
     <l n="574">Flashing , unapprehended , through his brain !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="575">And now , as they drove Southward , day and night ,</l>
     <l n="576">Through storm and calm , the shores that fleeted by</l>
     <l n="577">Grew wilder , grander , with his growing soul ,</l>
     <l n="578">And pregnant with the approaching mystery .</l>
     <l n="579">And now along the Patagonian coast</l>
     <l n="580">They cruised , and in the solemn midnight saw</l>
     <l n="581">Wildernesses of shaggy barren marl ,</l>
     <l n="582">Petrified seas of lava , league on league ,</l>
     <l n="583">Craters and bouldered slopes and granite cliffs</l>
     <l n="584">With ragged rents , grim gorges , deep ravines ,</l>
     <l n="585">And precipice on precipice up-piled</l>
     <l n="586">Innumerable to those dim distances</l>
     <l n="587">Where , over valleys hanging in the clouds ,</l>
     <l n="588">Gigantic mountains and volcanic peaks</l>
     <l n="589">Catching the wefts of cirrus fleece appeared</l>
     <l n="590">To smoke against the sky , though all was now</l>
     <l n="591">Dead as that frozen chaos of the moon ,</l>
     <l n="592">Or some huge passion of a slaughtered soul</l>
     <l n="593">Prostrate under the marching of the stars .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="594">At last , and in a silver dawn , they came</l>
     <l n="595">Suddenly on a broad-winged estuary ,</l>
     <l n="596">And , in the midst of it , an island lay ,</l>
     <l n="597">There they found shelter , on its leeward side ,</l>
     <l n="598">And Drake convened upon the Golden Hynde</l>
     <l n="599">His dread court-martial . Two long hours he heard</l>
     <l n="600">Defence and accusation , then broke up</l>
     <l n="601">The conclave , and , with burning heart and brain ,</l>
     <l n="602">Feverishly seeking everywhere some sign</l>
     <l n="603">To guide him , went ashore upon that isle ,</l>
     <l n="604">And lo , turning a rugged point of rock ,</l>
     <l n="605">He rubbed his eyes to find out if he dreamed ,</l>
     <l n="606">For there — a Crusoe 's wonder , a miracle ,</l>
     <l n="607">A sign — before him stood on that lone strand</l>
     <l n="608">Stark , with a stern arm pointing out his way</l>
     <l n="609">And jangling still one withered skeleton ,</l>
     <l n="610">The grim black gallows where Magellan hanged</l>
     <l n="611">His mutineers . Its base was white with bones</l>
     <l n="612">Picked by the gulls , and crumbling o'er the sand</l>
     <l n="613">A dread sea-salt , dry from the tides of time .</l>
     <l n="614">There , on that lonely shore , Death 's finger-post</l>
     <l n="615">Stood like some old forgotten truth made strange</l>
     <l n="616">By the long lapse of many memories ,</l>
     <l n="617">All starting up in resurrection now</l>
     <l n="618">As at the trump of doom , heroic ghosts</l>
     <l n="619">Out of the cells and graves of his deep brain</l>
     <l n="620">Reproaching him . “ Were this man not thy friend ,</l>
     <l n="621">Ere now he should have died the traitor 's death .</l>
     <l n="622">What wilt thou say to others if they , too ,</l>
     <l n="623">Prove false ? Or wilt thou slay the lesser and save</l>
     <l n="624">The greater sinner ? Nay , if thy right hand</l>
     <l n="625">Offend thee , cut it off ! ” And , in one flash ,</l>
     <l n="626">Drake saw his path and chose it .</l>
     <l n="627">With a voice</l>
     <l n="628">Low as the passionless anguished voice of Fate</l>
     <l n="629">That comprehends all pain , but girds it round</l>
     <l n="630">With iron , lest some random cry break out</l>
     <l n="631">For man 's misguidance , he drew all his men</l>
     <l n="632">Around him , saying , “ Ye all know how I loved</l>
     <l n="633">Doughty , who hath betrayed me twice and thrice ,</l>
     <l n="634">For I still trusted him : he was no felon</l>
     <l n="635">That I should turn my heart away from him .</l>
     <l n="636">He is the type and image of man 's laws ;</l>
     <l n="637">While I — am lawless as the soul that still</l>
     <l n="638">Must sail and seek a world beyond the worlds ,</l>
     <l n="639">A law behind earth 's laws . I dare not judge !</l>
     <l n="640">But ye — who know the mighty goal we seek ,</l>
     <l n="641">Who have seen him sap our courage , hour by hour ,</l>
     <l n="642">Till God Himself almost appeared a dream</l>
     <l n="643">Behind his technicalities and doubts</l>
     <l n="644">Of aught he could not touch or handle : ye</l>
     <l n="645">Who have seen him stir up jealousy and strife</l>
     <l n="646">Between our seamen and our gentlemen ,</l>
     <l n="647">Even as the world stirs up continual strife ,</l>
     <l n="648">Bidding the man forget he is a man</l>
     <l n="649">With God 's own patent of nobility ;</l>
     <l n="650">Ye who have seen him strike this last sharp blow —</l>
     <l n="651">Sharper than any enemy hath struck ,—</l>
     <l n="652">He whom I trusted , he alone could strike —</l>
     <l n="653">So sharply , for indeed I loved this man .</l>
     <l n="654">Judge ye — for see , I cannot . Do not doubt</l>
     <l n="655">I loved this man !</l>
     <l n="656">But now , if ye will let him have his life ,</l>
     <l n="657">Oh , speak ! But , if ye think it must be death ,</l>
     <l n="658">Hold up your hands in silence ! ” His voice dropped ,</l>
     <l n="659">And eagerly he whispered forth one word</l>
     <l n="660">Beyond the scope of Fate —</l>
     <l n="661">“ I would not have him die ! ” There was no sound</l>
     <l n="662">Save the long thunder of eternal seas ,—</l>
     <l n="663">Drake bowed his head and waited .</l>
     <l n="664">Suddenly ,</l>
     <l n="665">One man upheld his hand ; then , all at once ,</l>
     <l n="666">A brawny forest of brown arms arose</l>
     <l n="667">In silence , and the great sea whispered Death .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="19">
     <l n="668">There , with one big swift impulse , Francis Drake</l>
     <l n="669">Held out his right sun-blackened hand and gripped</l>
     <l n="670">The hand that Doughty proffered him ; and lo ,</l>
     <l n="671">Doughty laughed out and said , “ Since I must die ,</l>
     <l n="672">Let us have one more hour of comradeship ,</l>
     <l n="673">One hour as old companions . Let us make</l>
     <l n="674">A feast here , on this island , ere I go</l>
     <l n="675">Where there is no more feasting . ” So they made</l>
     <l n="676">A great and solemn banquet as the day</l>
     <l n="677">Decreased ; and Doughty bade them all unlock</l>
     <l n="678">Their sea-chests and bring out their rich array .</l>
     <l n="679">There , by that wondering ocean of the West ,</l>
     <l n="680">In crimson doublets , lined and slashed with gold ,</l>
     <l n="681">In broidered lace and double golden chains</l>
     <l n="682">Embossed with rubies and great cloudy pearls</l>
     <l n="683">They feasted , gentlemen adventurers ,</l>
     <l n="684">Drinking old malmsey , as the sun sank down .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="20">
     <l n="685">Now Doughty , fronting the rich death of day ,</l>
     <l n="686">And flourishing a silver pouncet-box</l>
     <l n="687">With many a courtly jest and rare conceit ,</l>
     <l n="688">There as he sat in rich attire , out-braved</l>
     <l n="689">The rest . Though darker-hued , yet richer far ,</l>
     <l n="690">His murrey-coloured doublet double-piled</l>
     <l n="691">Of Genoa velvet , puffed with ciprus , shone ;</l>
     <l n="692">For over its grave hues the gems that bossed</l>
     <l n="693">His golden collar , wondrously relieved ,</l>
     <l n="694">Blazed lustrous to the West like stars . But Drake</l>
     <l n="695">Was clad in black , with midnight silver slashed ,</l>
     <l n="696">And , at his side , a great two-handed sword .</l>
     <l n="697">At last they rose , just as the sun 's last rays</l>
     <l n="698">Rested upon the heaving molten gold</l>
     <l n="699">Immeasurable . The long slow sigh of the waves</l>
     <l n="700">That creamed across the lonely time-worn reef</l>
     <l n="701">All round the island seemed the very voice</l>
     <l n="702">Of the Everlasting : black against the sea</l>
     <l n="703">The gallows of Magellan stretched its arm</l>
     <l n="704">With the gaunt skeleton and its rusty chain</l>
     <l n="705">Creaking and swinging in the solemn breath</l>
     <l n="706">Of eventide like some strange pendulum</l>
     <l n="707">Measuring out the moments that remained .</l>
     <l n="708">There did they take the holy sacrament</l>
     <l n="709">Of Jesus ’ body and blood . Then Doughty and Drake</l>
     <l n="710">Kissed each other , as brothers , on the cheek ;</l>
     <l n="711">And Doughty knelt . And Drake , without one word ,</l>
     <l n="712">Leaning upon the two-edged naked sword</l>
     <l n="713">Stood at his side , with iron lips , and eyes</l>
     <l n="714">Full of the sunset ; while the doomed man bowed</l>
     <l n="715">His head upon a rock . The great sun dropped</l>
     <l n="716">Suddenly , and the land and sea were dark ;</l>
     <l n="717">And as it were a sign , Drake lifted up</l>
     <l n="718">The gleaming sword . It seemed to sweep the heavens</l>
     <l n="719">Down in its arc as he smote , once , and no more .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="21">
     <l n="720">Then , for a moment , silence froze their veins ,</l>
     <l n="721">Till one fierce seamen stooped with a hoarse cry ;</l>
     <l n="722">And , like an eagle clutching up its prey ,</l>
     <l n="723">His arm swooped down and bore the head aloft ,</l>
     <l n="724">Gorily streaming , by the long dark hair ;</l>
     <l n="725">And a great shout went up , “ So perish all</l>
     <l n="726">Traitors to God and England . ” Then Drake turned</l>
     <l n="727">And bade them to their ships ; and , wondering ,</l>
     <l n="728">They left him . As the boats thrust out from shore</l>
     <l n="729">Brave old Tom Moone looked back with faithful eyes</l>
     <l n="730">Like a great mastiff to his master 's face .</l>
     <l n="731">He , looming larger from his loftier ground</l>
     <l n="732">Clad with the slowly gathering night of stars</l>
     <l n="733">And gazing seaward o'er his quiet dead ,</l>
     <l n="734">Seemed like some Titan bronze in grandeur based</l>
     <l n="735">Unshakeable until the crash of doom</l>
     <l n="736">Shatter the black foundations of the world .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Dawn , everlasting and almighty Dawn ,</l>
     <l n="2">Hailed by ten thousand names of death and birth ,</l>
     <l n="3">Who , chiefly by thy name of Sorrow , seem'st</l>
     <l n="4">To half the world a sunset , God 's great Dawn ,</l>
     <l n="5">Fair light of all earth 's partings till we meet</l>
     <l n="6">Where dawn and sunset , mingling East and West ,</l>
     <l n="7">Shall make in some deep Orient of the soul</l>
     <l n="8">One radiant Rose of Love for evermore ;</l>
     <l n="9">Teach me , oh teach to bear thy broadening light ,</l>
     <l n="10">Thy deepening wonder , lest as old dreams fade</l>
     <l n="11">With love 's unfaith , like wasted hours of youth ,</l>
     <l n="12">And dim illusions vanish in thy beam ,</l>
     <l n="13">Their rapture and their anguish break that heart</l>
     <l n="14">Which loved them , and must love for ever now .</l>
     <l n="15">Let thy great sphere of splendour , ring by ring</l>
     <l n="16">For ever widening , draw new seas , new skies ,</l>
     <l n="17">Within my ken ; yet , as I still must bear</l>
     <l n="18">This love , help me to grow in spirit with thee .</l>
     <l n="19">Dawn on my song which trembles like a cloud</l>
     <l n="20">Pierced with thy beauty . Rise , shine , as of old</l>
     <l n="21">Across the wondering ocean in the sight</l>
     <l n="22">Of those world-wandering mariners , when earth</l>
     <l n="23">Rolled flat up to the Gates of Paradise ,</l>
     <l n="24">And each slow mist that curled its gold away</l>
     <l n="25">From each new sea they furrowed into pearl</l>
     <l n="26">Might bring before their blinded mortal eyes</l>
     <l n="27">God and the Glory . Lighten as on the soul</l>
     <l n="28">Of him that all night long in torment dire ,</l>
     <l n="29">Anguish and thirst unceasing for thy ray</l>
     <l n="30">Upon that lonely Patagonian shore</l>
     <l n="31">Had lain as on the bitterest coasts of Hell .</l>
     <l n="32">For all night long , mocked by the dreadful peace</l>
     <l n="33">Of world-wide seas that darkly heaved and sank</l>
     <l n="34">With cold recurrence , like the slow sad breath</l>
     <l n="35">Of a fallen Titan dying all alone</l>
     <l n="36">In lands beyond all human loneliness ,</l>
     <l n="37">While far and wide glimmers that broken targe</l>
     <l n="38">Hurled from tremendous battle with the gods ,</l>
     <l n="39">And , as he breathes in pain , the chain-mail rings</l>
     <l n="40">Round his broad breast a muffled rattling make</l>
     <l n="41">For many a league , so seemed the sound of waves</l>
     <l n="42">Upon those beaches — there , be-mocked all night ,</l>
     <l n="43">Beneath Magellan 's gallows , Drake had watched</l>
     <l n="44">Beside his dead ; and over him the stars</l>
     <l n="45">Paled as the silver chariot of the moon</l>
     <l n="46">Drove , and her white steeds ramped in a fury of foam</l>
     <l n="47">On splendid peaks of cloud . The Golden Hynde</l>
     <l n="48">Slept with those other shadows on the bay .</l>
     <l n="49">Between him and his home the Atlantic heaved ;</l>
     <l n="50">And , on the darker side , across the strait</l>
     <l n="51">Of starry sheen that softly rippled and flowed</l>
     <l n="52">Betwixt the mainland and his isle , it seemed</l>
     <l n="53">Death 's Gates indeed burst open . The night yawned</l>
     <l n="54">Like a foul wound . Black shapes of the outer dark</l>
     <l n="55">Poured out of forests older than the world ;</l>
     <l n="56">And , just as reptiles that take form and hue ,</l>
     <l n="57">Speckle and blotch , in strange assimilation</l>
     <l n="58">From thorn and scrub and stone and the waste earth</l>
     <l n="59">Through which they crawl , so that almost they seem</l>
     <l n="60">The incarnate spirits of their wilderness ,</l>
     <l n="61">Were these most horrible kindred of the night .</l>
     <l n="62">Æonian glooms unfathomable , grim aisles ,</l>
     <l n="63">Grotesque , distorted boughs and dancing shades</l>
     <l n="64">Out-belched their dusky brood on the dim shore ;</l>
     <l n="65">Monsters with sooty limbs , red-raddled eyes ,</l>
     <l n="66">And faces painted yellow , women and men ;</l>
     <l n="67">Fierce naked giants howling to the moon ,</l>
     <l n="68">And loathlier Gorgons with long snaky tresses</l>
     <l n="69">Pouring vile purple over pendulous breasts</l>
     <l n="70">Like wine-bags . On the mainland beach they lit</l>
     <l n="71">A brushwood fire that reddened creek and cove</l>
     <l n="72">And lapped their swarthy limbs with hideous tongues</l>
     <l n="73">Of flame ; so near that by their light Drake saw</l>
     <l n="74">The blood upon the dead man 's long black hair</l>
     <l n="75">Clotting corruption . The fierce funeral pyre</l>
     <l n="76">Of all things fair seemed rolling on that shore ;</l>
     <l n="77">And in that dull red battle of smoke and flame ,</l>
     <l n="78">While the sea crunched the pebbles , and dark drums</l>
     <l n="79">Rumbled out of the gloom as if this earth</l>
     <l n="80">Had some Titanic tigress for a soul</l>
     <l n="81">Purring in forests of Eternity</l>
     <l n="82">Over her own grim dreams , his lonely spirit</l>
     <l n="83">Passed through the circles of a world-wide waste</l>
     <l n="84">Darker than ever Dante roamed . No gulf</l>
     <l n="85">Was this of fierce harmonious reward ,</l>
     <l n="86">Where Evil moans in anguish after death ,</l>
     <l n="87">Where all men reap as they have sown , where gluttons</l>
     <l n="88">Gorge upon toads and usurers gulp hot streams</l>
     <l n="89">Of molten gold . This was that Malebolge</l>
     <l n="90">Which hath no harmony to mortal ears ,</l>
     <l n="91">But seems the reeling and tremendous dream</l>
     <l n="92">Of some omnipotent madman . There he saw</l>
     <l n="93">The naked giants dragging to the flames</l>
     <l n="94">Young captives hideous with a new despair :</l>
     <l n="95">He saw great craggy blood-stained stones upheaved</l>
     <l n="96">To slaughter , saw through mists of blood and fire</l>
     <l n="97">The cannibal feast prepared , saw filthy hands</l>
     <l n="98">Rend limb from limb , and almost dreamed he saw</l>
     <l n="99">Foul mouths a-drip with quivering human flesh</l>
     <l n="100">And horrible laughter in the crimson storm</l>
     <l n="101">That clomb and leapt and stabbed at the high heaven</l>
     <l n="102">Till the whole night seemed saturate with red .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="103">And all night long upon the Golden Hynde ,</l>
     <l n="104">A cloud upon the waters , brave Tom Moone</l>
     <l n="105">Watched o'er the bulwarks for some dusky plunge</l>
     <l n="106">To warn him if that savage crew should mark</l>
     <l n="107">His captain and swim over to his isle .</l>
     <l n="108">Whistle in hand he watched , his boat well ready ,</l>
     <l n="109">His men low-crouched around him , swarthy faces</l>
     <l n="110">Grim-chinned upon the taffrail , muttering oaths</l>
     <l n="111">That trampled down the fear i ’ their bristly throats ,</l>
     <l n="112">While at their sides a dreadful hint of steel</l>
     <l n="113">Sent stray gleams to the stars . But little heed</l>
     <l n="114">Had Drake of all that menaced him , though oft</l>
     <l n="115">Some wandering giant , belching from the feast ,</l>
     <l n="116">All blood-besmeared , would come so near he heard</l>
     <l n="117">His heavy breathing o'er the narrow strait .</l>
     <l n="118">Yet little care had Drake , for though he sat</l>
     <l n="119">Bowed in the body above his quiet dead ,</l>
     <l n="120">His burning spirit wandered through the wastes ,</l>
     <l n="121">Wandered through hells behind the apparent hell ,</l>
     <l n="122">Horrors immeasurable , clutching at dreams</l>
     <l n="123">Found fair of old , but now most foul . The world</l>
     <l n="124">Leered at him through its old remembered mask</l>
     <l n="125">Of beauty : the green grass that clothed the fields</l>
     <l n="126">Of England ( shallow , shallow fairy dream ! )</l>
     <l n="127">What was it but the hair of dead men 's graves .</l>
     <l n="128">Rooted in death , enriched with all decay ?</l>
     <l n="129">And like a leprosy the hawthorn bloom</l>
     <l n="130">Crawled o'er the whitening bosom of the spring ;</l>
     <l n="131">And bird and beast and insect , ay and man ,</l>
     <l n="132">How fat they fed on one another 's blood !</l>
     <l n="133">And Love , what faith in Love , when spirit and flesh</l>
     <l n="134">Are found of such a filthy composition ?</l>
     <l n="135">And Knowledge , God , his mind went reeling back</l>
     <l n="136">To that dark voyage on the deadly coast</l>
     <l n="137">Of Panama , where one by one his men</l>
     <l n="138">Sickened and died of some unknown disease ,</l>
     <l n="139">Till Joseph , his own brother , in his arms</l>
     <l n="140">Died ; and Drake trampled down all tender thought ,</l>
     <l n="141">All human grief , and sought to find the cause ,</l>
     <l n="142">For his crew 's sake , the ravenous unknown cause</l>
     <l n="143">Of that fell scourge . There , in his own dark cabin ,</l>
     <l n="144">Lit by the wild light of the swinging lanthorn ,</l>
     <l n="145">He laid the naked body on that board</l>
     <l n="146">Where they had supped together . He took the knife</l>
     <l n="147">From the ague-stricken surgeon 's palsied hands ,</l>
     <l n="148">And while the ship rocked in the eternal seas</l>
     <l n="149">And dark waves lapped against the rolling hulk</l>
     <l n="150">Making the silence terrible with voices ,</l>
     <l n="151">He opened his own brother 's cold white corse ,</l>
     <l n="152">That pale deserted mansion of a soul ,</l>
     <l n="153">Bidding the surgeon mark , with his own eyes ,</l>
     <l n="154">While yet he had strength to use them , the foul spots ,</l>
     <l n="155">The swollen liver , the strange sodden heart ,</l>
     <l n="156">The yellow intestines . Yea , his dry lips hissed</l>
     <l n="157">There in the stark face of Eternity ,</l>
     <l n="158">“ Seëst thou ? Seëst thou ? Knowest thou what it means ? ”</l>
     <l n="159">Then , like a dream up-surged the belfried night</l>
     <l n="160">Of Saint Bartholomew , the scented palaces</l>
     <l n="161">Whence harlots leered out on the twisted streets</l>
     <l n="162">Of Paris , choked with slaughter ! Europe flamed</l>
     <l n="163">With human torches , living altar candles ,</l>
     <l n="164">Lighted before the Cross where men had hanged</l>
     <l n="165">The Christ of little children . Cirque by cirque</l>
     <l n="166">The world-wide hell reeled round him , East and West ,</l>
     <l n="167">To where the tortured Indians worked the will</l>
     <l n="168">Of lordly Spain in golden-famed Peru .</l>
     <l n="169">“ God , is thy world a madman 's dream ? ” he groaned :</l>
     <l n="170">And suddenly , the clamour on the shore</l>
     <l n="171">Sank and that savage horde melted away</l>
     <l n="172">Into the midnight forest as it came ,</l>
     <l n="173">Leaving no sign , save where the brushwood fire</l>
     <l n="174">Still smouldered like a ruby in the gloom ;</l>
     <l n="175">And into the inmost caverns of his mind</l>
     <l n="176">That other clamour sank , and there was peace .</l>
     <l n="177">“ A madman 's dream , ” he whispered , “ Ay , to me</l>
     <l n="178">A madman 's dream , ” but better , better far</l>
     <l n="179">Than that which bears upon its awful gates ,</l>
     <l n="180">Gates of a hell defined , unalterable ,</l>
     <l n="181">Abandon hope all ye who enter here !</l>
     <l n="182">Here , here at least the dawn hath power to bring</l>
     <l n="183">New light , new hope , new battles . Men may fight</l>
     <l n="184">And sweep away that evil , if no more ,</l>
     <l n="185">At least from the small circle of their swords ;</l>
     <l n="186">Then die , content if they have struck one stroke</l>
     <l n="187">For freedom , knowledge , brotherhood ; one stroke</l>
     <l n="188">To hasten that great kingdom God proclaims</l>
     <l n="189">Each morning through the trumpets of the Dawn .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="190">And far away , in Italy , that night</l>
     <l n="191">Young Galileo , gazing upward , heard</l>
     <l n="192">The self-same whisper from the abyss of stars</l>
     <l n="193">Which lured the soul of Shakespeare as he lay</l>
     <l n="194">Dreaming in may-sweet England , even now ,</l>
     <l n="195">And with its infinite music called once more</l>
     <l n="196">The soul of Drake out to the unknown West .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="197">Now like a wild rose in the fields of heaven</l>
     <l n="198">Slipt forth the slender fingers of the Dawn ,</l>
     <l n="199">And drew the great grey Eastern curtains back</l>
     <l n="200">From the ivory saffroned couch . Rosily slid</l>
     <l n="201">One shining foot and one warm rounded knee</l>
     <l n="202">From silken coverlets of the tossed-back clouds .</l>
     <l n="203">Then , like the meeting after desolate years ,</l>
     <l n="204">Face to remembered face , Drake saw the Dawn</l>
     <l n="205">Step forth in naked splendour o'er the sea ;</l>
     <l n="206">Dawn , bearing still her rich divine increase</l>
     <l n="207">Of beauty , love , and wisdom round the world ;</l>
     <l n="208">The same , yet not the same . So strangely gleamed</l>
     <l n="209">Her pearl and rose across the sapphire waves</l>
     <l n="210">That scarce he knew the dead man at his feet .</l>
     <l n="211">His world was made anew . Strangely his voice</l>
     <l n="212">Rang through that solemn Eden of the morn</l>
     <l n="213">Calling his men , and stranger than a dream</l>
     <l n="214">Their boats black-blurred against the crimson East ,</l>
     <l n="215">Or flashing misty sheen where'er the light</l>
     <l n="216">Smote on their smooth wet sides , like seraph ships</l>
     <l n="217">Moved in a dewy glory towards the land ;</l>
     <l n="218">Their oars of glittering diamond broke the sea</l>
     <l n="219">As by enchantment into burning jewels</l>
     <l n="220">And scattered rainbows from their flaming blades .</l>
     <l n="221">The clear green water lapping round their prows ,</l>
     <l n="222">The words of sharp command as now the keels</l>
     <l n="223">Crunched on his lonely shore , and the following wave</l>
     <l n="224">Leapt slapping o'er the sterns , in that new light</l>
     <l n="225">Were more than any miracle . At last</l>
     <l n="226">Drake , as they grouped a little way below</l>
     <l n="227">The crumbling sandy cliff whereon he stood ,</l>
     <l n="228">Seeming to overshadow them as he loomed</l>
     <l n="229">A cloud of black against the crimson sky ,</l>
     <l n="230">Spoke , as a man may hardly speak but once :</l>
     <l n="231">“ My seamen , oh my friends , companions , kings ;</l>
     <l n="232">For I am least among you , being your captain ;</l>
     <l n="233">And ye are men , and all men born are kings ,</l>
     <l n="234">By right divine , and I the least of these</l>
     <l n="235">Because I must usurp the throne of God</l>
     <l n="236">And sit in judgment , even till I have set</l>
     <l n="237">My seal upon the red wax of this blood ,</l>
     <l n="238">This blood of my dead friend , ere it grow cold .</l>
     <l n="239">Not all the waters of that mighty sea</l>
     <l n="240">Could wash my hands of sin if I should now</l>
     <l n="241">Falter upon my path . But look to it , you ,</l>
     <l n="242">Whose word was doom last night to this dead man ;</l>
     <l n="243">Look to it , I say , look to it ! Brave men might shrink</l>
     <l n="244">From this great voyage ; but the heart of him</l>
     <l n="245">Who dares turn backward now must be so hardy</l>
     <l n="246">That God might make a thousand millstones of it</l>
     <l n="247">To hang about the necks of those that hurt</l>
     <l n="248">Some little child , and cast them in the sea .</l>
     <l n="249">Yet if ye will be found so more than bold ,</l>
     <l n="250">Speak now , and I will hear you ; God will judge .</l>
     <l n="251">But ye shall take four ships of these my five ,</l>
     <l n="252">Tear out the lions from their painted shields ,</l>
     <l n="253">And speed you homeward . Leave me but one ship ,</l>
     <l n="254">My Golden Hynde , and five good friends , nay one ,</l>
     <l n="255">To watch when I must sleep , and I will prove</l>
     <l n="256">This judgment just against all winds that blow .</l>
     <l n="257">Now ye that will return , speak , let me know you ,</l>
     <l n="258">Or be for ever silent , for I swear</l>
     <l n="259">Over this butchered body , if any swerve</l>
     <l n="260">Hereafter from the straight and perilous way ,</l>
     <l n="261">He shall not die alone . What ? Will none speak ?</l>
     <l n="262">My comrades and my friends ! Yet ye must learn ,</l>
     <l n="263">Mark me , my friends , I 'd have you all to know</l>
     <l n="264">That ye are kings . I 'll have no jealousies</l>
     <l n="265">Aboard my fleet . I 'll have the gentleman</l>
     <l n="266">To pull and haul wi ’ the seaman . I 'll not have</l>
     <l n="267">That canker of the Spaniards in my fleet .</l>
     <l n="268">Ye that were captains , I cashier you all .</l>
     <l n="269">I 'll have no captains ; I 'll have nought but seamen ,</l>
     <l n="270">Obedient to my will , because I serve</l>
     <l n="271">England . What , will ye murmur ? Have a care ,</l>
     <l n="272">Lest I should bid you homeward all alone ,</l>
     <l n="273">You whose white hands are found too delicate</l>
     <l n="274">For aught but dallying with your jewelled swords !</l>
     <l n="275">And thou , too , master Fletcher , my ship 's chaplain ,</l>
     <l n="276">Mark me , I 'll have no priest-craft . I have heard</l>
     <l n="277">Overmuch talk of judgment from thy lips ,</l>
     <l n="278">God 's judgment here , God 's judgment there , upon us !</l>
     <l n="279">Whene'er the winds are contrary , thou takest</l>
     <l n="280">Their powers upon thee for thy moment 's end .</l>

     <l n="283">If thou canst read this wide world like a book ,</l>
     <l n="284">Thou hast so little to fear , I 'll set thee adrift</l>
     <l n="285">On God 's great sea to find thine own way home .</l>
     <l n="286">Why , ‘ tis these very tyrannies o ’ the soul</l>
     <l n="287">We strike at when we strike at Spain for England ;</l>
     <l n="288">And shall we here , in this great wilderness ,</l>
     <l n="289">Ungrappled and unchallenged , out of sight ,</l>
     <l n="290">Alone , without one struggle , sink that flag</l>
     <l n="291">Which , when the cannon thundered , could but stream</l>
     <l n="292">Triumphant over all the storms of death .</l>
     <l n="293">Nay , master Wynter and my gallant captains ,</l>
     <l n="294">I see ye are tamed . Take up your ranks again</l>
     <l n="295">In humbleness , remembering ye are kings ,</l>
     <l n="296">Kings for the sake and by the will of England ,</l>
     <l n="297">Therefore her servants till your lives ’ last end .</l>
     <l n="298">Comrades , mistake not this , our little fleet</l>
     <l n="299">Is freighted with the golden heart of England ,</l>
     <l n="300">And , if we fail , that golden heart will break .</l>
     <l n="301">The world 's wide eyes are on us , and our souls</l>
     <l n="302">Are woven together into one great flag</l>
     <l n="303">Of England . Shall we strike it ? Shall it be rent</l>
     <l n="304">Asunder with small discord , party strife ,</l>
     <l n="305">Ephemeral conflict of contemptible tongues ,</l>
     <l n="306">Or shall it be blazoned , blazoned evermore</l>
     <l n="307">On the most heaven-wide page of history ?</l>
     <l n="308">This is that hour , I know it in my soul ,</l>
     <l n="309">When we must choose for England . Ye are kings ,</l>
     <l n="310">And sons of Vikings , exiled from your throne .</l>
     <l n="311">Have ye forgotten ? Nay , your blood remembers !</l>
     <l n="312">There is your kingdom , Vikings , that great ocean</l>
     <l n="313">Whose tang is in your nostrils . Ye must choose</l>
     <l n="314">Whether to re-assume it now for England ,</l>
     <l n="315">To claim its thunders for her panoply ,</l>
     <l n="316">To lay its lightnings in her sovereign hands ,</l>
     <l n="317">Win her the great commandment of the sea</l>
     <l n="318">And let its glory roll with her dominion</l>
     <l n="319">Round the wide world for ever , sweeping back</l>
     <l n="320">All evil deeds and dreams , or whether to yield</l>
     <l n="321">For evermore that kinghood . Ye must learn</l>
     <l n="322">Here in this golden dawn our great emprise</l>
     <l n="323">Is greater than we knew . Eye hath not seen ,</l>
     <l n="324">Ear hath not heard what came across the dark</l>
     <l n="325">Last night , as there anointed with that blood</l>
     <l n="326">I knelt and saw the wonder that should be .</l>
     <l n="327">I saw new heavens of freedom , a new earth</l>
     <l n="328">Released from all old tyrannies . I saw</l>
     <l n="329">The brotherhood of man , for which we rode ,</l>
     <l n="330">Most ignorant of the splendour of our spears ,</l>
     <l n="331">Against the crimson dynasties of Spain .</l>
     <l n="332">Mother of freedom , home and hope and love ,</l>
     <l n="333">Our little island , far , how far away ,</l>
     <l n="334">I saw thee shatter the whole world of hate ,</l>
     <l n="335">I saw the sunrise on thy helmet flame</l>
     <l n="336">With new-born hope for all the world in thee !</l>
     <l n="337">Come now , to sea , to sea ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="338">And ere they knew</l>
     <l n="339">What power impelled them , with one mighty cry</l>
     <l n="340">They lifted up their hearts to the new dawn</l>
     <l n="341">And hastened down the shores and launched the boats ,</l>
     <l n="342">And in the fierce white out-draught of the waves</l>
     <l n="343">Thrust with their brandished oars and the boats leapt</l>
     <l n="344">Out , and they settled at the groaning thwarts ,</l>
     <l n="345">And the white water boiled before their blades ,</l>
     <l n="346">As , with Drake 's iron hand upon the helm ,</l>
     <l n="347">His own boat led the way ; and ere they knew</l>
     <l n="348">What power as of a wind bore them along ,</l>
     <l n="349">Anchor was up , their hands were on the sheets ,</l>
     <l n="350">The sails were broken out and that small squadron</l>
     <l n="351">Was flying like a sea-bird to the South .</l>
     <l n="352">Now to the strait Magellanus they came ,</l>
     <l n="353">And entered in with ringing shouts of joy .</l>
     <l n="354">Nor did they think there , was a fairer strait</l>
     <l n="355">In all the world than this which lay so calm</l>
     <l n="356">Between great silent mountains crowned with snow ,</l>
     <l n="357">Unutterably lonely . Marvellous</l>
     <l n="358">The pomp of dawn and sunset on those heights ,</l>
     <l n="359">And like a strange new sacrilege the advance</l>
     <l n="360">Of prows that ploughed that time-forgotten tide .</l>
     <l n="361">But soon rude flaws , cross currents , tortuous channels</l>
     <l n="362">Bewildered them , and many a league they drove</l>
     <l n="363">As down some vaster Acheron , while the coasts</l>
     <l n="364">With wailing voices cursed them all night long ,</l>
     <l n="365">And once again the hideous fires leapt red</l>
     <l n="366">By many a grim wrenched crag and gaunt ravine .</l>
     <l n="367">So for a hundred leagues of whirling spume</l>
     <l n="368">They groped , till suddenly , far away , they saw</l>
     <l n="369">Full of the sunset , like a cup of gold ,</l>
     <l n="370">The purple Westward portals of the strait .</l>
     <l n="371">Onward o'er roughening waves they plunged and reached</l>
     <l n="372">Capo Desiderato , where they saw</l>
     <l n="373">What seemed stupendous in that lonely place ,—</l>
     <l n="374">Gaunt , black , and sharp as death against the sky</l>
     <l n="375">The Cross , the great black Cross on Cape Desire ,</l>
     <l n="376">Which dead Magellan raised upon the height</l>
     <l n="377">To guide , or so he thought , his wandering ships ,</l>
     <l n="378">Not knowing they had left him to his doom ,</l>
     <l n="379">Not knowing how with tears , with tears of joy ,</l>
     <l n="380">Rapture , and terrible triumph , and deep awe ,</l>
     <l n="381">Another should come voyaging and read</l>
     <l n="382">Unutterable glories in that sign ;</l>
     <l n="383">While his rough seamen raised their mighty shout</l>
     <l n="384">And , once again , before his wondering eyes ,</l>
     <l n="385">League upon league of awful burnished gold ,</l>
     <l n="386">Rolled the unknown immeasurable sea .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="387">Now , in those days , as even Magellan held ,</l>
     <l n="388">Men thought that Southward of the strait there swept</l>
     <l n="389">Firm land up to the white Antarticke Pole ,</l>
     <l n="390">Which now not far they deemed . But when Drake passed</l>
     <l n="391">From out the strait to take his Northward way</l>
     <l n="392">Up the Pacific coast , a great head-wind</l>
     <l n="393">Suddenly smote them ; and the heaving seas</l>
     <l n="394">Bulged all around them into billowy hills ,</l>
     <l n="395">Dark rolling mountains , whose majestic crests</l>
     <l n="396">Like wild white flames far-blown and savagely flickering</l>
     <l n="397">Swept through the clouds ; and on their sullen slopes</l>
     <l n="398">Like wind-whipt withered leaves those little ships ,</l>
     <l n="399">Now hurtled to the Zenith and now plunged</l>
     <l n="400">Down into bottomless gulfs , were suddenly scattered</l>
     <l n="401">And whirled away . Drake , on the Golden Hynde ,</l>
     <l n="402">One moment saw them near him , soaring up</l>
     <l n="403">Above him on the huge o'erhanging billows</l>
     <l n="404">As if to crash down on his poop ; the next ,</l>
     <l n="405">A mile of howling sea had swept between</l>
     <l n="406">Each of those wind-whipt straws , and they were gone</l>
     <l n="407">Through roaring deserts of embattled death ,</l>
     <l n="408">Where , like a hundred thousand chariots charged</l>
     <l n="409">With lightnings and with thunders , one great wave</l>
     <l n="410">Leading the unleashed ocean down the storm</l>
     <l n="411">Hurled them away to Southward .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="412">One last glimpse</l>
     <l n="413">Drake caught o ’ the Marygold , when some mighty vortex</l>
     <l n="414">Wide as the circle of the wide sea-line</l>
     <l n="415">Swept them together again . He saw her staggering</l>
     <l n="416">With mast snapt short and wreckage-tangled deck</l>
     <l n="417">Where men like insects clung . He saw the waves</l>
     <l n="418">Leap over her mangled hulk , like wild white wolves ,</l>
     <l n="419">Volleying out of the clouds down dismal steeps</l>
     <l n="420">Of green-black water . Like a wounded steed</l>
     <l n="421">Quivering upon its haunches , up she heaved</l>
     <l n="422">Her head to throw them off . Then , in one mass</l>
     <l n="423">Of fury crashed the great deep over her ,</l>
     <l n="424">Trampling her down , down into the nethermost pit ,</l>
     <l n="425">As with a madman 's wrath . She rose no more ,</l>
     <l n="426">And in the stream of the ocean 's hurricane laughter</l>
     <l n="427">The Golden Hynde went hurtling to the South ,</l>
     <l n="428">With sails rent into ribbons and her mast</l>
     <l n="429">Snapt like a twig . Yea , where Magellan thought</l>
     <l n="430">Firm land had been , the little Golden Hynde</l>
     <l n="431">Whirled like an autumn leaf through league on league</l>
     <l n="432">Of bursting seas , chaos on crashing chaos ,</l>
     <l n="433">A rolling wilderness of charging Alps</l>
     <l n="434">That shook the world with their tremendous war ;</l>
     <l n="435">Grim beetling cliffs that grappled with clamorous gulfs ,</l>
     <l n="436">Valleys that yawned to swallow the wide heaven ;</l>
     <l n="437">Immense white-flowering fluctuant precipices ,</l>
     <l n="438">And hills that swooped down at the throat of hell ;</l>
     <l n="439">From Pole to Pole , one blanching bursting storm</l>
     <l n="440">Of world-wide oceans , where the huge Pacific</l>
     <l n="441">Roared greetings to the Atlantic and both swept</l>
     <l n="442">In broad white cataracts , league on struggling league ,</l>
     <l n="443">Pursuing and pursued , immeasurable ,</l>
     <l n="444">With Titan hands grasping the rent black sky</l>
     <l n="445">East , West , North , South . Then , then was battle indeed</l>
     <l n="446">Of midget men upon that wisp of grass</l>
     <l n="447">The Golden Hynde , who , as her masts crashed , hung</l>
     <l n="448">Clearing the tiny wreckage from small decks</l>
     <l n="449">With ant-like weapons . Not their captain 's voice</l>
     <l n="450">Availed them now amidst the deafening thunder</l>
     <l n="451">Of seas that felt the heavy hand of God ,</l>
     <l n="452">Only they saw across the blinding spume</l>
     <l n="453">In steely flashes , grand and grim , a face ,</l>
     <l n="454">Like the last glimmer of faith among mankind ,</l>
     <l n="455">Calm in this warring universe , where Drake</l>
     <l n="456">Stood , lashed to his post , beside the helm . Black seas</l>
     <l n="457">Buffeted him . Half-stunned he dashed away</l>
     <l n="458">The sharp brine from his eagle eyes and turned</l>
     <l n="459">To watch some mountain-range come rushing down</l>
     <l n="460">As if to o'erwhelm them utterly . Once , indeed ,</l>
     <l n="461">Welkin and sea were one black wave , white-fanged ,</l>
     <l n="462">White-crested , and up-heaped so mightily</l>
     <l n="463">That , though it coursed more swiftly than a herd</l>
     <l n="464">Of Titan steeds upon some terrible plain</l>
     <l n="465">Nigh the huge City of Ombos , yet it seemed</l>
     <l n="466">Most strangely slow , with all those crumbling crests</l>
     <l n="467">Each like a cataract on a mountain-side ,</l>
     <l n="468">And moved with the steady majesty of doom</l>
     <l n="469">High over him . One moment 's flash of fear ,</l>
     <l n="470">And yet not fear , but rather life 's regret ,</l>
     <l n="471">Felt Drake , then laughed a low deep laugh of joy</l>
     <l n="472">Such as men taste in battle ; yea , ‘ twas good</l>
     <l n="473">To grapple thus with death ; one low deep laugh ,</l>
     <l n="474">One mutter as of a lion about to spring ,</l>
     <l n="475">Then burst that thunder o'er him . Height o'er height</l>
     <l n="476">The heavens rolled down , and waves were all the world .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="477">Meanwhile , in England , dreaming of her sailor ,</l>
     <l n="478">Far off , his heart 's bride waited , of a proud</l>
     <l n="479">And stubborn house the bright and gracious flower .</l>
     <l n="480">Whom oft her father urged with scanty grace</l>
     <l n="481">That Drake was dead and she had best forget</l>
     <l n="482">The fellow , he grunted . For her father 's heart</l>
     <l n="483">Was fettered with small memories , mocked by all</l>

     <l n="501">But she , his daughter , only let her heart</l>
     <l n="502">Loveably forge a charter for her love ,</l>
     <l n="503">Cheat her false creed with faithful faery dreams</l>
     <l n="504">That wrapt her love in mystery ; thought , perchance ,</l>
     <l n="505">He came of some unhappy noble race</l>
     <l n="506">Ruined in battle for some lost high cause .</l>
     <l n="507">And , in the general mixture of men 's blood ,</l>
     <l n="508">Her dream was truer than his whose bloodless pride</l>
     <l n="509">Urged her to wed the chinless moon-struck fool</l>
     <l n="510">Sprung from five hundred years of idiocy</l>
     <l n="511">Who now besought her hand ; would force her bear</l>

     <l n="523">So she — the girl — Sweet Bess of Sydenham ,</l>
     <l n="524">Most innocently proud , was prouder yet</l>
     <l n="525">Than thus to let her heart stoop to the lure</l>
     <l n="526">Of lording lovers , though her unstained soul</l>
     <l n="527">Slumbered amidst those dreams as in old tales</l>
     <l n="528">The princess in the enchanted forest sleeps</l>

     <l n="530">The far-flung hues o ’ the gleaming magic web</l>
     <l n="531">Into one heart of flame . And now , for Drake ,</l>
     <l n="532">She slept like Brynhild in a ring of fire</l>
     <l n="533">Which he must pass to win her . For the wrath</l>
     <l n="534">Of Spain now flamed , awaiting his return ,</l>
     <l n="535">All round the seas of home ; and even the Queen</l>
     <l n="536">Elizabeth flinched , as that tremendous Power</l>
     <l n="537">Menaced the heart of England , flinched and vowed</l>
     <l n="538">Drake 's head to Spain 's ambassadors , though still</l>
     <l n="539">By subtlety she hoped to find some way</l>
     <l n="540">Later to save or warn him ere he came .</l>
     <l n="541">Perchance too , nay , most like , he will be slain</l>
     <l n="542">Or even now lies dead , out in the West ,</l>

     <l n="545">Of startled winds from o'er the Spanish Main ,</l>
     <l n="546">Strange echoes as of sacked and clamouring ports</l>
     <l n="547">And battered gates of fabulous golden cities ,</l>
     <l n="548">A murmur out of the sunset of Peru ,</l>
     <l n="549">A sea-bird 's wail from Lima . While no less</l>

     <l n="564">Grasping the Cross of Christ by its great hilt ,</l>
     <l n="565">She pointed it , like a dagger , tow'rds the throat</l>
     <l n="566">Of England .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="567">One long year , two years had passed</l>
     <l n="568">Since Drake set sail from grey old Plymouth Sound ;</l>
     <l n="569">And in those woods of faery wonder still</l>
     <l n="570">Slumbered his love in steadfast faith . But now</l>
     <l n="571">With louder lungs her father urged — “ He is dead :</l>
     <l n="572">Forget him . There is one that loves you , seeks</l>
     <l n="573">Your hand in marriage , and he is a goodly match</l>
     <l n="574">E'en for my daughter . You shall wed him , Bess ! ”</l>
     <l n="575">But when the new-found lover came to woo ,</l>
     <l n="576">Glancing in summer silks and radiant hose ,</l>
     <l n="577">Whipt doublet and enormous pointed shoon ,</l>
     <l n="578">She played him like a fish and sent him home</l>
     <l n="579">Spluttering with dismay , a stickleback</l>
     <l n="580">Discoloured , a male minnow of dimpled streams</l>
     <l n="581">With all his rainbows paling in the prime ,</l>
     <l n="582">To hide amongst his lilies , while once more</l>
     <l n="583">She took her casement seat that overlooked</l>
     <l n="584">The sea and read in Master Spenser 's book ,</l>
     <l n="585">Which Francis gave “ To my dear lady and queen</l>
     <l n="586">Bess , ” that most rare processional of love —</l>
     <l n="587">“ Sweet Thames , run softly till I end my song ! ”</l>
     <l n="588">Yet did her father urge her day by day ,</l>
     <l n="589">And day by day her mother dinned her ears</l>
     <l n="590">With petty saws , as — “ When I was a girl , ”</l>
     <l n="591">And “ I remember what my father said , ”</l>
     <l n="592">And “ Love , oh feather-fancies plucked from geese</l>
     <l n="593">You call your poets ! ” Yet she hardly meant</l>
     <l n="594">To slight true love , save in her daughter 's heart ;</l>
     <l n="595">For the old folk ever find it hard to see</l>
     <l n="596">The passion of their children . When it wakes ,</l>
     <l n="597">The child becomes a stranger . So with Bess ;</l>
     <l n="598">But since her soul still slumbered , and the moons</l>
     <l n="599">Rolled on and blurred her soul 's particular love</l>
     <l n="600">With the vague unknown impulse of her youth ,</l>
     <l n="601">Her brave resistance often melted now</l>
     <l n="602">In tears , and her will weakened day by day ;</l>
     <l n="603">Till on a dreadful summer morn there came ,</l>
     <l n="604">Borne by a wintry flaw , home to the Thames ,</l>
     <l n="605">A bruised and battered ship , all that was left ,</l>
     <l n="606">So said her crew , of Drake 's ill-fated fleet .</l>
     <l n="607">John Wynter , her commander , told the tale</l>
     <l n="608">Of how the Golden Hynde and Marygold</l>
     <l n="609">Had by the wind Euroclydon been driven</l>
     <l n="610">Sheer o'er the howling edges of the world ;</l>
     <l n="611">Of how himself by God 's good providence</l>
     <l n="612">Was hurled into the strait Magellanus ;</l>
     <l n="613">Of how on the horrible frontiers of the Void</l>
     <l n="614">He had watched in vain , lit red with beacon-fires</l>
     <l n="615">The desperate coasts o ’ the black abyss , whence none</l>
     <l n="616">Ever returned , though many a week he watched</l>
     <l n="617">Beneath the Cross ; and only saw God 's wrath</l>
     <l n="618">Burn through the heavens and devastate the mountains ,</l>
     <l n="619">And hurl unheard of oceans roaring down</l>
     <l n="620">After the lost ships in one cataract</l>
     <l n="621">Of thunder and splendour and fury and rolling doom .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="622">Then , with a bitter triumph in his face ,</l>
     <l n="623">As if this were the natural end of all</l>
     <l n="624">Such vile plebeians , as if he had foreseen it ,</l>
     <l n="625">As if himself had breathed a tactful hint</l>
     <l n="626">Into the aristocratic ears of God ,</l>
     <l n="627">Her father broke the last frail barriers down ,</l>
     <l n="628">Broke the poor listless will o ’ the lonely girl ,</l>
     <l n="629">Who careless now of aught but misery</l>
     <l n="630">Promised to wed their lordling . Mighty speed</l>
     <l n="631">They made to press that loveless marriage on ;</l>
     <l n="632">And ere the May had mellowed into June</l>
     <l n="633">Her marriage eve had come . Her cold hands held</l>
     <l n="634">Drake 's gift . She scarce could see her name , writ broad</l>
     <l n="635">By that strong hand as it was , To my queen Bess .</l>
     <l n="636">She looked out through her casement o'er the sea ,</l>
     <l n="637">Listening its old enchanted moan , which seemed</l>
     <l n="638">Striving to speak , she knew not what . Its breath</l>
     <l n="639">Fluttered the roses round the grey old walls ,</l>
     <l n="640">And shook the ghostly jasmine . A great moon</l>
     <l n="641">Hung like a red lamp in the sycamore .</l>
     <l n="642">A corn-crake in the hay-fields far away</l>
     <l n="643">Chirped like a cricket , and the night-jar churred</l>
     <l n="644">His passionate love-song . Soft-winged moths besieged</l>
     <l n="645">Her lantern . Under many a star-stabbed elm</l>
     <l n="646">The nightingale began his golden song ,</l>
     <l n="647">Whose warm thick notes are each a drop of blood</l>
     <l n="648">From that small throbbing breast against the thorn</l>
     <l n="649">Pressed close to turn the white rose into red ;</l>
     <l n="650">Even as her lawn-clad may-white bosom pressed</l>
     <l n="651">Quivering against the bars , while her dark hair</l>
     <l n="652">Streamed round her shoulders and her small bare feet</l>
     <l n="653">Gleamed in the dusk . Then spake she to her maid —</l>
     <l n="654">“ I cannot sleep , I cannot sleep to-night .</l>
     <l n="655">Bring thy lute hither and sing . Alison , think you</l>
     <l n="656">The dead can watch us from their distant world ?</l>
     <l n="657">Can our dead friends be near us when we weep ?</l>
     <l n="658">I wish ‘ twere so ! for then my love would come ,</l>
     <l n="659">No matter then how far , my love would come ,</l>
     <l n="660">And he 'd forgive me . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="661">Then Bess bowed down her lovely head : her breast</l>
     <l n="662">Heaved with short sobs , sickening at the heart ,</l>
     <l n="663">She grasped the casement moaning , “ Love , Love , Love ,</l>
     <l n="664">Come quickly , come , before it is too late ,</l>
     <l n="665">Come quickly , oh come quickly . ”</l>
     <l n="666">Then her maid</l>
     <l n="667">Slipped a soft arm around her and gently drew</l>
     <l n="668">The supple quivering body , shaken with sobs ,</l>
     <l n="669">And all that firm young , sweetness to her breast ,</l>
     <l n="670">And led her to her couch , and all night long</l>
     <l n="671">She watched beside her , till the marriage morn</l>
     <l n="672">Blushed in the heartless East . Then swiftly flew</l>
     <l n="673">The pitiless moments , till — as in a dream —</l>
     <l n="674">And borne along by dreams , or like a lily</l>
     <l n="675">Cut from its anchorage in the stream to glide</l>
     <l n="676">Down the smooth bosom of an unknown world</l>
     <l n="677">Through fields of unknown blossom , so moved Bess</l>
     <l n="678">Amongst her maids , as the procession passed</l>
     <l n="679">Forth to the little church upon the cliffs ,</l>
     <l n="680">And , as in those days was the bridal mode ,</l>
     <l n="681">Her lustrous hair in billowing beauty streamed</l>
     <l n="682">Dishevelled o'er her shoulders , while the sun</l>
     <l n="683">Caressed her bent and glossy head , and shone</l>
     <l n="684">Over the deep blue , white-flaked , wrinkled sea ,</l>
     <l n="685">On full-blown rosy-petalled sails that flashed</l>
     <l n="686">Like flying blossoms fallen from her crown .</l>

      <l n="6">‘ Tis a thousand to one against us : we 'll turn to the West again !</l>
      <l n="7">We have captured a China pilot , his charts and his golden keys :</l>

      <l n="9">Over the immeasurable molten gold</l>
      <l n="10">Wrapped in a golden haze , onward they drew ;</l>
      <l n="11">And now they saw the tiny purple quay</l>
      <l n="12">Grow larger and darker and brighten into brown</l>
      <l n="13">Across the swelling sparkle of the waves .</l>
      <l n="14">Brown on the quay , a train of tethered mules</l>
      <l n="15">Munched at the nose-bags , while a Spaniard drowsed</l>
      <l n="16">On guard beside what seemed at first a heap</l>
      <l n="17">Of fish , then slowly turned to silver bars</l>
      <l n="18">Up-piled and glistering in the enchanted sun .</l>
      <l n="19">Nor did that sentry wake as , like a dream ,</l>
      <l n="20">The Golden Hynde divided the soft sleep</l>
      <l n="21">Of warm green lapping water , sidled up ,</l>
      <l n="22">Sank sail , and moored beside the quay . But Drake ,</l>
      <l n="23">Lightly leaping ashore and stealing nigh ,</l>
      <l n="24">Picked up the Spaniard 's long gay-ribboned gun</l>
      <l n="25">Close to his ear . At once , without a sound ,</l>
      <l n="26">The watchman opened his dark eyes and stared</l>
      <l n="27">As at strange men who suddenly had come ,</l>
      <l n="28">Borne by some magic carpet , from the stars ;</l>
      <l n="29">Then , with a courtly bow , his right hand thrust</l>
      <l n="30">Within the lace embroideries of his breast .</l>
      <l n="31">Politely Drake , with pained apologies</l>
      <l n="32">For this disturbance of a cavalier</l>
      <l n="33">Napping on guard , straightway resolved to make</l>
      <l n="34">Complete amends , by now relieving him</l>
      <l n="35">Of these — which doubtless troubled his repose —</l>
      <l n="36">These anxious bars of silver . With that word</l>
      <l n="37">Two seamen leaped ashore and , gathering up</l>
      <l n="38">The bars in a stout old patch of tawny sail ,</l>
      <l n="39">Slung them aboard . No sooner this was done</l>
      <l n="40">Than out o ’ the valley , like a foolish jest</l>
      <l n="41">Out of the mouth of some great John-a-dreams ,</l>
      <l n="42">In soft procession of buffoonery</l>
      <l n="43">A woolly train of llamas proudly came</l>
      <l n="44">Stepping by two and two along the quay ,</l>
      <l n="45">Laden with pack on pack of silver bars</l>
      <l n="46">And driven by a Spaniard . His amaze</l>
      <l n="47">The seamen greeted with profuser thanks</l>
      <l n="48">For his most punctual thought and opportune</l>
      <l n="49">Courtesy . None the less they must avouch</l>
      <l n="50">It pained them much to see a cavalier</l>
      <l n="51">Turned carrier ; and , at once , they must insist</l>
      <l n="52">On easing him of that too sordid care .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="4">
      <l n="53">Then out from Tarapaca once again</l>
      <l n="54">They sailed , their hold a glimmering mine of wealth ,</l>
      <l n="55">Towards Arica and Lima , where they deemed</l>
      <l n="56">The prize of prizes waited unaware .</l>
      <l n="57">For every year a gorgeous galleon sailed</l>
      <l n="58">With all the harvest of Potosi 's mines</l>
      <l n="59">And precious stones from dead king 's diadems ,</l>
      <l n="60">Aztecs ’ and Incas ’ gem-encrusted crowns ,</l>
      <l n="61">Pearls from the glimmering Temples of the Moon ,</l>
      <l n="62">Rich opals with their milky rainbow-clouds ,</l>
      <l n="63">White diamonds from the Temples of the Sun ,</l>
      <l n="64">Carbuncles flaming scarlet , amethysts ,</l>
      <l n="65">Rubies , and sapphires ; these to Spain she brought</l>
      <l n="66">To glut her priestly coffers . Now not far</l>
      <l n="67">Ahead they deemed she lay upon that coast ,</l>
      <l n="68">Crammed with the lustrous Indies , wrung with threat</l>
      <l n="69">And torture from the naked Indian slaves .</l>
      <l n="70">To him that spied her top-sails first a prize</l>
      <l n="71">Drake offered of the wondrous chain he wore ;</l>
      <l n="72">And every seaman , every ship-boy , watched</l>
      <l n="73">Not only for the prize , but for their friends ,</l>
      <l n="74">If haply these had weathered through the storm .</l>
      <l n="75">Nor did they know their friends had homeward turned ,</l>
      <l n="76">Bearing to England and to England 's Queen ,</l>
      <l n="77">And his heart 's queen , the tale that Drake was dead .</l>

     <lg type="stanza" n="5">
      <l n="78">Northward they cruised along a warm , wild coast</l>
      <l n="79">That like a most luxurious goddess drowsed</l>
      <l n="80">Supine to heaven , her arms behind her head ,</l>
      <l n="81">One knee up-thrust to make a mountain-peak ,</l>
      <l n="82">Her rosy breasts up-heaving their soft snow</l>
      <l n="83">In distant Andes , and her naked side</l>
      <l n="84">With one rich curve for half a hundred leagues</l>
      <l n="85">Bathed by the creaming foam ; her heavy hair</l>
      <l n="86">Fraught with the perfume of a thousand forests</l>
      <l n="87">Tossed round about her beauty : and her mouth</l>
      <l n="88">A scarlet mystery of distant flower</l>
      <l n="89">Up-turned to take the kisses of the sun .</l>
      <l n="90">But like a troop of boys let loose from school</l>
      <l n="91">The adventurers went by , startling the stillness</l>
      <l n="92">Of that voluptuous dream-encumbered shore</l>
      <l n="93">With echoing shouts of laughter and alien song .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="6">
      <l n="94">But as they came to Arica , from afar</l>
      <l n="95">They heard the clash of bells upon the breeze ,</l>
      <l n="96">And knew that Rumour with her thousand wings</l>
      <l n="97">Had rushed before them . Horsemen in the night</l>
      <l n="98">Had galloped through the white coast-villages</l>
      <l n="99">And spread the dreadful cry “ El Draque ! ” abroad ,</l>
      <l n="100">And when the gay adventurers drew nigh</l>
      <l n="101">They found the quays deserted , and the ships</l>
      <l n="102">All flown , except one little fishing-boat</l>
      <l n="103">Wherein an old man like a tortoise moved</l>
      <l n="104">A wrinkled head above the rusty net</l>
      <l n="105">His crawling hands repaired . He seemed to dwell</l>
      <l n="106">Outside the world of war and peace , outside</l>
      <l n="107">Everything save his daily task , and cared</l>
      <l n="108">No whit who else might win or lose ; for all</l>
      <l n="109">The pilot asked of him without demur</l>
      <l n="110">He answered , scarcely looking from his work .</l>
      <l n="111">A galleon laden with eight hundred bars</l>
      <l n="112">Of silver , not three hours ago had flown</l>
      <l n="113">Northward , he muttered . Ere the words were out ,</l>
      <l n="114">The will of Drake thrilled through the Golden Hynde</l>
      <l n="115">Like one sharp trumpet-call , and ere they knew</l>
      <l n="116">What power impelled them , crowding on all sail</l>
      <l n="117">Northward they surged , and roaring down the wind</l>
      <l n="118">At Chiuli , port of Arequipa , saw</l>
      <l n="119">The chase at anchor . Wondering they came</l>
      <l n="120">With all the gunners waiting at their guns</l>
      <l n="121">Bare-armed and silent — nearer , nearer yet ,—</l>
      <l n="122">Close to the enemy . But no sight or sound</l>
      <l n="123">Of living creature stirred upon her decks .</l>
      <l n="124">Only a great grey cat lay in the sun</l>
      <l n="125">Upon a warm smooth cannon-butt . A chill</l>
      <l n="126">Ran through the veins of even the boldest there</l>
      <l n="127">At that too peaceful silence . Cautiously</l>
      <l n="128">Drake neared her in his pinnace : cautiously ,</l>
      <l n="129">Cutlass in hand , up that mysterious hull</l>
      <l n="130">He clomb , and wondered , as he climbed , to breathe</l>
      <l n="131">The friendly smell o ’ the pitch and hear the waves</l>
      <l n="132">With their incessant old familiar sound</l>
      <l n="133">Crackling and slapping against her windward flank .</l>
      <l n="134">A ship of dreams was that ; for when they reached</l>
      <l n="135">The silent deck , they saw no crouching forms ,</l>
      <l n="136">They heard no sound of life . Only the hot</l>
      <l n="137">Creak of the cordage whispered in the sun .</l>
      <l n="138">The cat stood up and yawned , and slunk away</l>
      <l n="139">Slowly , with furtive glances . The great hold</l>
      <l n="140">Was empty , and the rich cabin stripped and bare .</l>
      <l n="141">Suddenly one of the seamen with a cry</l>
      <l n="142">Pointed where , close inshore , a little boat</l>
      <l n="143">Stole towards the town ; and , with a louder cry ,</l>
      <l n="144">Drake bade his men aboard the Golden Hynde .</l>
      <l n="145">Scarce had they pulled two hundred yards away</l>
      <l n="146">When , with a roar that seemed to buffet the heavens</l>
      <l n="147">And rip the heart of the sea out , one red flame</l>
      <l n="148">Blackened with fragments , the great galleon burst</l>
      <l n="149">Asunder ! All the startled waves were strewn</l>
      <l n="150">With wreckage ; and Drake laughed —</l>
      <l n="151">“ My lads , we have diced</l>
      <l n="152">With death to-day , and won ! My merry lads ,</l>
      <l n="153">It seems that Spain is bolting with the stakes !</l>
      <l n="154">Now , if I have to stretch the skies for sails</l>
      <l n="155">And summon the blasts of God up from the South</l>
      <l n="156">To fill my canvas , I will overhaul</l>
      <l n="157">Those dusky devils with the treasure-ship</l>
      <l n="158">That holds our hard-earned booty . Pull hard all ,</l>
      <l n="159">Hard for the Golden Hynde . ”</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="7">
      <l n="160">And so they came</l>
      <l n="161">At dead of night on Callao de Lima !</l>
      <l n="162">They saw the harbour lights across the waves</l>
      <l n="163">Glittering , and the shadowy hulks of ships</l>
      <l n="164">Gathered together like a flock of sheep</l>
      <l n="165">Within the port . With shouts and clink of chains</l>
      <l n="166">A shadowy ship was entering from the North ,</l>
      <l n="167">And like the shadow of that shadow slipped</l>
      <l n="168">The Golden Hynde beside her thro ’ the gloom ;</l>
      <l n="169">And side by side they anchored in the port</l>
      <l n="170">Amidst the shipping ! Over the dark tide</l>
      <l n="171">A small boat from the customs-house drew near .</l>
      <l n="172">A sleepy , yawning , gold-laced officer</l>
      <l n="173">Boarded the Golden Hynde , and with a cry ,</l>
      <l n="174">Stumbling against a cannon-butt , he saw</l>
      <l n="175">The bare-armed British seamen in the gloom</l>
      <l n="176">All waiting by their guns . Wildly he plunged</l>
      <l n="177">Over the side and urged his boat away ,</l>
      <l n="178">Crying , “ El Draque ! El Draque ! ” At that dread word</l>
      <l n="179">The darkness filled with clamour , and the ships ,</l>
      <l n="180">Cutting their cables , drifted here and there</l>
      <l n="181">In mad attempts to seek the open sea .</l>
      <l n="182">Wild lights burnt hither and thither , and all the port ,</l>
      <l n="183">One furnace of confusion , heaved and seethed</l>
      <l n="184">In terror ; for each shadow of the night ,</l>
      <l n="185">Nay , the great night itself , was all El Draque .</l>
      <l n="186">The Dragon 's wings were spread from quay to quay ,</l>
      <l n="187">The very lights that burnt from mast to mast</l>
      <l n="188">And flared across the tide kindled his breath</l>
      <l n="189">To fire ; while here and there a British pinnace</l>
      <l n="190">Slipped softly thro ’ the roaring gloom and glare ,</l>
      <l n="191">Ransacking ship by ship ; for each one thought</l>
      <l n="192">A fleet had come upon them . Each gave up</l>
      <l n="193">The struggle as each was boarded ; while , elsewhere ,</l>
      <l n="194">Cannon to cannon , friends bombarded friends .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="8">
      <l n="195">Yet not one ounce of treasure in Callao</l>
      <l n="196">They found ; for , fourteen days before they came ,</l>
      <l n="197">That greatest treasure-ship of Spain , with all</l>
      <l n="198">The gorgeous harvest of that year , had sailed</l>
      <l n="199">For Panama : her ballast — silver bars ;</l>
      <l n="200">Her cargo — rubies , emeralds , and gold .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="9">
      <l n="201">Out through the clamour and the darkness , out ,</l>
      <l n="202">Out to the harbour mouth , the Golden Hynde ,</l>
      <l n="203">Steered by the iron soul of Drake , returned :</l>
      <l n="204">And where the way was blocked , her cannon clove</l>
      <l n="205">A crimson highway to the midnight sea .</l>
      <l n="206">Then Northward , Northward , o'er the jewelled main ,</l>
      <l n="207">Under the white moon like a storm they drove</l>
      <l n="208">In quest of the Cacafuego . Fourteen days</l>
      <l n="209">Her start was ; and at dawn the fair wind sank ,</l>
      <l n="210">And chafing lay the Golden Hynde , becalmed ;</l>
      <l n="211">While , on the hills , the Viceroy of Peru</l>
      <l n="212">Marched down from Lima with two thousand men ,</l>
      <l n="213">And sent out four huge ships of war to sink</l>
      <l n="214">Or capture the fierce Dragon . Loud laughed Drake</l>
      <l n="215">To see them creeping nigh , urged with great oars ,</l>
      <l n="216">Then suddenly pause ; for none would be the first</l>
      <l n="217">To close with him . And , ere they had steeled their hearts</l>
      <l n="218">To battle , a fair breeze broke out anew ,</l>
      <l n="219">And Northward sped the little Golden Hynde</l>
      <l n="220">In quest of the lordliest treasure-ship of Spain .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="10">
      <l n="221">Behind her lay a world in arms ; for now</l>
      <l n="222">Wrath and confusion clamoured for revenge</l>
      <l n="223">From sea to sea . Spain claimed the pirate 's head</l>
      <l n="224">From England , and awaited his return</l>
      <l n="225">With all her tortures . And where'er he passed</l>
      <l n="226">He sowed the dragon 's teeth , and everywhere</l>
      <l n="227">Cadmean broods of armèd men arose</l>
      <l n="228">And followed , followed on his fiery trail .</l>
      <l n="229">Men toiled at Lima to fit out a fleet</l>
      <l n="230">Grim enough to destroy him . All night long</l>
      <l n="231">The flare went up from cities on the coast</l>
      <l n="232">Where men like naked devils toiled to cast</l>
      <l n="233">Cannon that might have overwhelmed the powers</l>
      <l n="234">Of Michael when he drave that hideous rout</l>
      <l n="235">Through livid chaos to the black abyss .</l>
      <l n="236">Small hope indeed there seemed of safe return ;</l>
      <l n="237">But Northward sped the little Golden Hynde ,</l>
      <l n="238">The world-watched midget ship of eighteen guns ,</l>
      <l n="239">Undaunted ; and upon the second dawn</l>
      <l n="240">Sighted a galleon , not indeed the chase ,</l>
      <l n="241">Yet worth a pause ; for out of her they took —</l>
      <l n="242">Embossed with emeralds large as pigeon 's eggs —</l>
      <l n="243">A golden crucifix , with eighty pounds</l>
      <l n="244">In weight of gold . The rest they left behind ;</l>
      <l n="245">And onward , onward , to the North they flew —</l>
      <l n="246">A score of golden miles , a score of green ,</l>
      <l n="247">An hundred miles , eight hundred miles of foam ,</l>
      <l n="248">Rainbows and fire , ransacking as they went</l>
      <l n="249">Ship after ship for news o ’ the chase and gold ;</l>
      <l n="250">Learning from every capture that they drew</l>
      <l n="251">Nearer and nearer . At Truxillo , dim</l>
      <l n="252">And dreaming city , a-drowse with purple flowers ,</l>
      <l n="253">She had paused , ay , paused to take a freight of gold !</l>
      <l n="254">At Paita — she had passed two days in front ,</l>
      <l n="255">Only two days , two days ahead ; nay , one !</l>
      <l n="256">At Quito , close inshore , a youthful page ,</l>
      <l n="257">Bright-eyed , ran up the rigging and cried , “ A sail !</l>
      <l n="258">A sail ! The Cacafuego ! And the chain</l>
      <l n="259">Is mine ! ” And by the strange cut of her sails ,</l>
      <l n="260">Whereof they had been told in Callao ,</l>
      <l n="261">They knew her !</l>
      <l n="262">Heavily laden with her gems ,</l>
      <l n="263">Lazily drifting with her golden fruitage ,</l>
      <l n="264">Over the magic seas they saw her hull</l>
      <l n="265">Loom as they onward drew ; but Drake , for fear</l>
      <l n="266">The prey might take alarm and run ashore ,</l>
      <l n="267">Trailed wine-skins , filled with water , over the side</l>
      <l n="268">To hold his ship back , till the darkness fell ,</l>
      <l n="269">And with the night the off-shore wind arose .</l>
      <l n="270">At last the sun sank down , the rosy light</l>
      <l n="271">Faded from Andes ’ peaked and bosomed snow :</l>
      <l n="272">The night-wind rose : the wine-skins were up-hauled ;</l>
      <l n="273">And , like a hound unleashed , the Golden Hynde</l>
      <l n="274">Leapt forward thro ’ the gloom .</l>
      <l n="275">A cable 's length</l>
      <l n="276">Divided them . The Cacafuego heard</l>
      <l n="277">A rough voice in the darkness bidding her</l>
      <l n="278">Heave to ! She held her course . Drake gave the word .</l>
      <l n="279">A broadside shattered the night , and over her side</l>
      <l n="280">Her main-yard clattered like a broken wing !</l>
      <l n="281">On to her decks the British sea-dogs swarmed ,</l>
      <l n="282">Cutlass in hand : that fight was at an end .</l>

     <lg type="stanza" n="11">
      <l n="283">The ship was cleared , a prize crew placed a-board ,</l>
      <l n="284">Then both ships turned their heads to the open sea .</l>
      <l n="285">At dawn , being out of sight of land , they ‘ gan</l>
      <l n="286">Examine the great prize . None ever knew</l>
      <l n="287">Save Drake and Gloriana what wild wealth</l>
      <l n="288">They had captured there . Thus much at least was known :</l>
      <l n="289">An hundredweight of gold , and twenty tons</l>
      <l n="290">Of silver bullion ; thirteen chests of coins ;</l>
      <l n="291">Nuggets of gold unnumbered ; countless pearls ,</l>
      <l n="292">Diamonds , emeralds ; but the worth of these</l>
      <l n="293">Was past all reckoning . In the crimson dawn ,</l>
      <l n="294">Ringed with the lonely pomp of sea and sky ,</l>
      <l n="295">The naked-footed seamen bathed knee-deep</l>
      <l n="296">In gold and gathered up Aladdin 's fruit —</l>
      <l n="297">All-colored gems — and tossed them in the sun .</l>
      <l n="298">The hold like one great elfin orchard gleamed</l>
      <l n="299">With dusky globes and tawny glories piled ,</l>
      <l n="300">Hesperian apples , heap on mellow heap ,</l>
      <l n="301">Rich with the hues of sunset , rich and ripe</l>
      <l n="302">And ready for the enchanted cider-press ;</l>
      <l n="303">An Emperor 's ransom in each burning orb ;</l>
      <l n="304">A kingdom 's purchase in each clustered bough ;</l>
      <l n="305">The freedom of all slaves in every chain .</l>

     <l n="1">Now like the soul of Ophir on the sea</l>
     <l n="2">Glittered the Golden Hynde , and all her heart</l>
     <l n="3">Turned home to England . As a child that finds</l>
     <l n="4">A ruby ring upon the highway , straight</l>
     <l n="5">Homeward desires to run with it , so she</l>
     <l n="6">Yearned for her home and country . Yet the world</l>
     <l n="7">Was all in arms behind her . Fleet on fleet</l>
     <l n="8">Awaited her return . Along the coast</l>
     <l n="9">The very churches melted down their chimes</l>
     <l n="10">And cast them into cannon . To the South</l>
     <l n="11">A thousand cannon watched Magellan 's straits ,</l>
     <l n="12">And fleets were scouring all the sea like hounds ,</l>
     <l n="13">With orders that where'er they came on Drake ,</l>
     <l n="14">Although he were the Dragon of their dreams ,</l>
     <l n="15">They should out-blast his thunders and convey ,</l>
     <l n="16">Dead or alive , his body back to Spain .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="17">And Drake laughed out and said , “ My trusty lads</l>
     <l n="18">Of Devon , you have made the wide world ring</l>
     <l n="19">With England 's name ; you have swept one half the seas</l>
     <l n="20">From sky to sky ; and in our oaken hold</l>
     <l n="21">You have packed the gorgeous Indies . We shall sail</l>
     <l n="22">But slowly with such wealth . If we return ,</l>
     <l n="23">We are one against ten thousand ! We will seek</l>
     <l n="24">The fabled Northern passage , take our gold</l>
     <l n="25">Safe home ; then out to sea again and try</l>
     <l n="26">Our guns against their guns . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="27">And as they sailed</l>
     <l n="28">Northward , they swooped on warm blue Guatulco</l>
     <l n="29">For food and water . Nigh the dreaming port</l>
     <l n="30">The grand alcaldes in high conclave sat ,</l>
     <l n="31">Blazing with gold and scarlet , as they tried</l>
     <l n="32">A batch of negro slaves upon the charge</l>
     <l n="33">Of idleness in Spanish mines ; dumb slaves ,</l>
     <l n="34">With bare scarred backs and labour-broken knees ,</l>
     <l n="35">And sorrowful eyes like those of wearied kine</l>
     <l n="36">Spent from the ploughing . Even as the judge</l>
     <l n="37">Rose to condemn them to the knotted lash</l>
     <l n="38">The British boat 's crew , quiet and compact ,</l>
     <l n="39">Entered the court . The grim judicial glare</l>
     <l n="40">Grew wider with amazement , and the judge</l>
     <l n="41">Staggered against his gilded throne .</l>
     <l n="42">“ I thank</l>
     <l n="43">Almighty God , ” cried Drake , “ who hath given me this</l>
     <l n="44">— That I who once , in ignorance , procured</l>
     <l n="45">Slaves for the golden bawdy-house of Spain ,</l>
     <l n="46">May now , in England 's name , help to requite</l>
     <l n="47">That wrong . For now I say in England 's name ,</l>
     <l n="48">Where'er her standard flies , the slave shall stand</l>
     <l n="49">Upright , the shackles fall from off his limbs .</l>
     <l n="50">Unyoke the prisoners : tell them they are men</l>
     <l n="51">Once more , not beasts of burden . Set them free ;</l>
     <l n="52">But take these gold and scarlet popinjays</l>
     <l n="53">Aboard my Golden Hynde ; and let them write</l>
     <l n="54">An order that their town shall now provide</l>
     <l n="55">My boats with food and water . ”</l>
     <l n="56">This being done ,</l>
     <l n="57">The slaves being placed in safety on the prize ,</l>
     <l n="58">The Golden Hynde revictualled and the casks</l>
     <l n="59">Replenished with fresh water , Drake set free</l>
     <l n="60">The judges and swept Northward once again ;</l>
     <l n="61">And , off the coast of Nicaragua , found</l>
     <l n="62">A sudden treasure better than all gold ;</l>
     <l n="63">For on the track of the China trade they caught</l>
     <l n="64">A ship whereon two China pilots sailed ,</l>
     <l n="65">And in their cabin lay the secret charts ,</l>
     <l n="66">Red hieroglyphs of Empire , unknown charts</l>
     <l n="67">Of silken sea-roads down the golden West</l>
     <l n="68">Where all roads meet and East and West are one .</l>
     <l n="69">And , with that mystery stirring in their hearts</l>
     <l n="70">Like a strange cry from home , Northward they swept</l>
     <l n="71">And Northward , till the soft luxurious coasts</l>
     <l n="72">Hardened , the winds grew bleak , the great green waves</l>
     <l n="73">Loomed high like mountains round them , and the spray</l>
     <l n="74">Froze on their spars and yards . Fresh from the warmth</l>
     <l n="75">Of tropic seas the men could hardly brook</l>
     <l n="76">That cold ; and when the floating hills of ice</l>
     <l n="77">Like huge green shadows crowned with ghostly snow</l>
     <l n="78">Went past them with strange whispers in the gloom ,</l>
     <l n="79">Or took mysterious colours in the dawn ,</l>
     <l n="80">Their hearts misgave them , and they found no way ;</l>
     <l n="81">But all was iron shore and icy sea .</l>
     <l n="82">And one by one the crew fell sick to death</l>
     <l n="83">In that fierce winter , and the land still ran</l>
     <l n="84">Westward and showed no passage . Tossed with storms ,</l>
     <l n="85">Onward they plunged , or furrowed gentler tides</l>
     <l n="86">Of ice-lit emerald that made the prow</l>
     <l n="87">A faery beak of some enchanted ship</l>
     <l n="88">Flinging wild rainbows round her as she drove</l>
     <l n="89">Thro ’ seas unsailed by mortal mariners ,</l>
     <l n="90">Past isles unhailed of any human voice ,</l>
     <l n="91">Where sound and silence mingled in one song</l>
     <l n="92">Of utter solitude . Ever as they went</l>
     <l n="93">The flag of England blazoned the broad breeze ,</l>
     <l n="94">Northward , where never ship had sailed before ,</l>
     <l n="95">Northward , till lost in helpless wonderment ,</l>
     <l n="96">Dazed as a soul awakening from the dream</l>
     <l n="97">Of death to some wild dawn in Paradise</l>
     <l n="98">( Yet burnt with cold as they whose very tears</l>
     <l n="99">Freeze on their faces where Cocytus wails )</l>
     <l n="100">All world-worn , bruised , wing-broken , wracked , and wrenched ,</l>
     <l n="101">Blackened with lightning , scarred as with evil deeds ,</l>
     <l n="102">But all embalmed in beauty by that sun</l>
     <l n="103">Which never sets , bosomed in peace at last</l>
     <l n="104">The Golden Hynde rocked on a glittering calm .</l>
     <l n="105">Seas that no ship had ever sailed , from sky</l>
     <l n="106">To glistening sky , swept round them . Glory and gleam ,</l>
     <l n="107">Glamour and lucid rapture and diamond air</l>
     <l n="108">Embraced her broken spars , begrimed with gold</l>
     <l n="109">Her gloomy hull , rocking upon a sphere</l>
     <l n="110">New made , it seemed , mysterious with the first</l>
     <l n="111">Mystery of the world , where holy sky</l>
     <l n="112">And sacred sea shone like the primal Light</l>
     <l n="113">Of God , a-stir with whispering sea-bird 's wings</l>
     <l n="114">And glorious with clouds . Only , all day ,</l>
     <l n="115">All night , the rhythmic utterance of His will</l>
     <l n="116">In the deep sigh of seas that washed His throne ,</l>
     <l n="117">Rose and relapsed across Eternity ,</l>
     <l n="118">Timed to the pulse of æons . All their world</l>
     <l n="119">Seemed strange as unto us the great new heavens</l>
     <l n="120">And glittering shores , if on some aery bark</l>
     <l n="121">To Saturn 's coasts we came and traced no more</l>
     <l n="122">The tiny gleam of our familiar earth</l>
     <l n="123">Far off , but heard tremendous oceans roll</l>
     <l n="124">Round unimagined continents , and saw</l>
     <l n="125">Terrible mountains unto which our Alps</l>
     <l n="126">Were less than mole-hills , and such gaunt ravines</l>
     <l n="127">Cleaving them and such cataracts roaring down</l>
     <l n="128">As burst the gates of our earth-moulded senses ,</l>
     <l n="129">Pour the eternal glory on our souls ,</l>
     <l n="130">And , while ten thousand chariots bring the dawn ,</l>
     <l n="131">Hurl us poor midgets trembling to our knees .</l>
     <l n="132">Glory and glamour and rapture of lucid air ,</l>
     <l n="133">Ice cold , with subtle colours of the sky</l>
     <l n="134">Embraced her broken spars , belted her hulk</l>
     <l n="135">With brilliance , while she dipped her jacinth beak</l>
     <l n="136">In waves of mounded splendour , and sometimes</l>
     <l n="137">A great ice-mountain flashed and floated by</l>
     <l n="138">Throned on the waters , pinnacled and crowned</l>
     <l n="139">With all the smouldering jewels in the world ;</l>
     <l n="140">Or in the darkness , glimmering berg on berg ,</l>
     <l n="141">All emerald to the moon , went by like ghosts</l>
     <l n="142">Whispering to the South .</l>
     <l n="143">There , as they lay ,</l>
     <l n="144">Waiting a wind to fill the stiffened sails ,</l>
     <l n="145">Their hearts remembered that in England now</l>
     <l n="146">The Spring was nigh , and in that lonely sea</l>
     <l n="147">The skilled musicians filled their eyes with home .</l>

      <l n="51">Turned Southward once again , until he found</l>
      <l n="52">A lonely natural harbour on the coast</l>
      <l n="53">Near San Francisco , where the cliffs were white</l>
      <l n="54">Like those of England , and the soft soil teemed</l>
      <l n="55">With gold . There they careened the Golden Hynde —</l>
      <l n="56">Her keel being thick with barnacles and weeds —</l>
      <l n="57">And built a fort and dockyard to refit</l>
      <l n="58">Their little wandering home , not half so large</l>
      <l n="59">As many a coasting barque to-day that scarce</l>
      <l n="60">Would cross the Channel , yet she had swept the seas</l>
      <l n="61">Of half the world , and even now prepared</l>
      <l n="62">For new adventures greater than them all .</l>
      <l n="63">And as the sound of chisel and hammer broke</l>
      <l n="64">The stillness of that shore , shy figures came ,</l>
      <l n="65">Keen-faced and grave-eyed Indians , from the woods</l>
      <l n="66">To bow before the strange white-faced newcomers</l>
      <l n="67">As gods . Whereat the chaplain all aghast</l>
      <l n="68">Persuaded them with signs and broken words</l>
      <l n="69">And grunts that even Drake was but a man ,</l>
      <l n="70">Whom none the less the savages would crown</l>
      <l n="71">With woven flowers and barbarous ritual</l>
      <l n="72">King of New Albion — so the seamen called</l>
      <l n="73">That land , remembering the white cliffs of home .</l>
      <l n="74">Much they implored , with many a sign and cry ,</l>
      <l n="75">Which by the rescued slaves upon the prize</l>
      <l n="76">Were part interpreted , that Drake would stay</l>
      <l n="77">And rule them ; and the vision of the great</l>
      <l n="78">Empire of Englishmen arose and flashed</l>
      <l n="79">A moment round them , on that lonely shore .</l>
      <l n="80">A small and weather-beaten band they stood ,</l>
      <l n="81">Bronzed seamen by the laughing rescued slaves ,</l>
      <l n="82">Ringed with gigantic loneliness and saw</l>
      <l n="83">An Empire that should liberate the world ;</l>
      <l n="84">A Power before the lightning of whose arms</l>
      <l n="85">Darkness should die and all oppression cease ;</l>
      <l n="86">A Federation of the strong and weak ,</l>
      <l n="87">Whereby the weak were strengthened and the strong</l>
      <l n="88">Made stronger in the increasing good of all ;</l>
      <l n="89">A gathering up of one another 's loads ;</l>
      <l n="90">A turning of the wasteful rage of war</l>
      <l n="91">To accomplish large and fruitful tasks of peace ,</l>
      <l n="92">Even as the strength of some great stream is turned</l>
      <l n="93">To grind the corn for bread . E'en thus on England</l>

      <l n="95">And saw not with their living eyes , but thou ,</l>
      <l n="96">England , mayst lift up eyes at last and see ,</l>
      <l n="97">Who , like that angel of the Apocalypse</l>

      <l n="99">The other upon the waters , and canst raise</l>

      <l n="102">At last their task was done , the Golden Hynde</l>
      <l n="103">Undocked , her white wings hoisted ; and away</l>
      <l n="104">Westward they swiftly glided from the shore</l>
      <l n="105">Where , with a wild lament , their Indian friends ,</l>
      <l n="106">Knee-deep i ’ the creaming foam , all stood at gaze ,</l>
      <l n="107">Like men that for one moment in their lives</l>

      <l n="109">And played upon the stage of vast events</l>
      <l n="110">Knowing , henceforward , all their life is nought .</l>
      <l n="111">But Westward sped the little Golden Hynde</l>
      <l n="112">Across the uncharted ocean , with no guide</l>
      <l n="113">But that great homing cry of all their hearts .</l>
      <l n="114">Far out of sight of land they steered , straight out</l>
      <l n="115">Across the great Pacific , in those days</l>
      <l n="116">When even the compass proved no trusty guide ,</l>
      <l n="117">Straight out they struck in that small bark , straight out</l>
      <l n="118">Week after week , without one glimpse of aught</l>
      <l n="119">But heaving seas , across the uncharted waste</l>
      <l n="120">Straight to the sunset . Laughingly they sailed ,</l>
      <l n="121">With all that gorgeous booty in their holds ,</l>
      <l n="122">A splendour dragging deep through seas of doom ,</l>
      <l n="123">A prey to the first great hurricane that blew</l>
      <l n="124">Except their God averted it . And still</l>
      <l n="125">Their skilled musicians cheered the way along</l>
      <l n="126">To shores beyond the sunset and the sea .</l>
      <l n="127">And oft at nights , the yellow fo'c ' sle lanthorn</l>
      <l n="128">Swung over swarthy singing faces grouped</l>
      <l n="129">Within the four small wooden walls that made</l>
      <l n="130">Their home and shut them from the unfathomable</l>
      <l n="131">Depths of mysterious gloom without that rolled</l>
      <l n="132">All around them ; or Tom Moone would heartily troll</l>
      <l n="133">A simple stave that struggled oft with thoughts</l>
      <l n="134">Beyond its reach , yet reached their hearts no less .</l>

     <l n="59">And some knee-deep beyond it , all one wild</l>
     <l n="60">Welcome to Francis Drake !</l>
     <l n="61">Wild kerchiefs fluttering , thunderous hurrahs</l>
     <l n="62">Rolling from quay to quay , a thousand arms</l>
     <l n="63">Outstretched to that grey ghostly little ship</l>
     <l n="64">At whose masthead the British flag still flew ;</l>
     <l n="65">Then , over all , in one tumultuous tide</l>
     <l n="66">Of pealing joy , the Plymouth bells outclashed</l>
     <l n="67">A nation 's welcome home to Francis Drake .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="68">The very Golden Hynde , no idle dream ,</l>
     <l n="69">The little ship that swept the Spanish Main ,</l>
     <l n="70">Carelessly lying there , in Plymouth Sound ,</l>
     <l n="71">The Golden Hynde , the wonder of the world ,</l>
     <l n="72">A glory wrapt her greyness , and no boat</l>
     <l n="73">Dared yet approach , save one , with Drake 's close friends ,</l>
     <l n="74">Who came to warn him : “ England stands alone</l>
     <l n="75">And Drake is made the price of England 's peace .</l>
     <l n="76">The Queen , perforce , must temporise with Spain ,</l>
     <l n="77">The Invincible ! She hath forfeited thy life</l>
     <l n="78">To Spain , against her will . Only by this</l>
     <l n="79">Rejection of thee as a privateer</l>
     <l n="80">She averted instant war ; for now the menace</l>
     <l n="81">Of Spain draws nigher , looms darker every hour .</l>
     <l n="82">The world is made Spain 's footstool . Philip , the King ,</l>
     <l n="83">E'en now hath added to her boundless power</l>
     <l n="84">Without a blow , the vast domains and wealth</l>
     <l n="85">Of Portugal , and deadlier yet , a coast</l>
     <l n="86">That crouches over against us . Cadiz holds</l>
     <l n="87">A huge Armada , none knows where to strike ;</l>
     <l n="88">And even this day a flying horseman brought</l>
     <l n="89">Rumours that Spain hath landed a great force</l>
     <l n="90">In Ireland . Mary of Scotland only waits</l>
     <l n="91">The word to stab us in the side for Rome .</l>
     <l n="92">The Queen , weighed down by Burleigh and the friends</l>
     <l n="93">Of peace at any cost , may yet be driven</l>
     <l n="94">To make thy life our ransom , which indeed</l>
     <l n="95">She hath already sworn , or seemed to swear . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="96">To whom Drake answered , “ Gloriana lives ;</l>
     <l n="97">And in her life mine only fear lies dead ,</l>
     <l n="98">Mine only fear , for England , not myself .</l>
     <l n="99">Willing am I and glad , as I have lived ,</l>
     <l n="100">To die for England 's sake .</l>
     <l n="101">Yet , lest the Queen be driven now to restore</l>
     <l n="102">This cargo that I bring her — a world 's wealth ,</l>
     <l n="103">The golden springs of all the power of Spain ,</l>
     <l n="104">The jewelled hearts of all those cruel realms</l>
     <l n="105">( For I have plucked them out ) beyond the sea ;</l>
     <l n="106">Lest she be driven to yield them up again</l>
     <l n="107">For Spain and Spain 's delight , I will warp out</l>
     <l n="108">Behind St. Nicholas ’ Island . The fierce plague</l>
     <l n="109">In Plymouth shall be colour and excuse ,</l>
     <l n="110">Until my courier return from court</l>
     <l n="111">With Gloriana 's will . If it be death ,</l>
     <l n="112">I 'll out again to sea , strew its rough floor</l>
     <l n="113">With costlier largesses than kings can throw ,</l>
     <l n="114">And , ere I die , will singe the Spaniard 's beard</l>
     <l n="115">And set the fringe of his imperial robe</l>
     <l n="116">Blazing along his coasts . Then let him roll</l>
     <l n="117">His galleons round the little Golden Hynde ,</l>
     <l n="118">Bring her to bay , if he can , on the high seas ,</l>
     <l n="119">Ring us about with thousands , we 'll not yield ,</l>
     <l n="120">I and my Golden Hynde , we will go down ,</l>
     <l n="121">With flag still flying on the last stump left us</l>
     <l n="122">And all my cannon spitting out the fires</l>
     <l n="123">Of everlasting scorn into his face . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="124">So Drake warped out the Golden Hynde anew</l>
     <l n="125">Behind St. Nicholas ’ Island . She lay there ,</l>
     <l n="126">The small grey-golden centre of the world</l>
     <l n="127">That raged all round her , the last hope , the star</l>
     <l n="128">Of Protestant freedom , she , the outlawed ship</l>
     <l n="129">Holding within her the great head and heart</l>
     <l n="130">Of England 's ocean power ; and all the fleets</l>
     <l n="131">That have enfranchised earth , in that small ship ,</l>
     <l n="132">Lay waiting for their doom .</l>
     <l n="133">Past her at night</l>
     <l n="134">Fisher-boats glided , wondering as they heard</l>
     <l n="135">In the thick darkness the great songs they deemed</l>
     <l n="136">Must oft have risen from many a lonely sea ;</l>
     <l n="137">For oft had Spaniards brought a rumour back</l>
     <l n="138">Of that strange pirate who in royal state</l>
     <l n="139">Sailed to a sound of violins , and dined</l>
     <l n="140">With skilled musicians round him , turning all</l>
     <l n="141">Battle and storm and death into a song .</l>

     <l n="93">Six days thereafter a fearful whisper reached</l>

     <l n="96">In secret conference with the Queen , nay more ,</l>

     <l n="109">Her officers of state with mouths awry</l>
     <l n="110">Informed the high ambassador of Spain ,</l>
     <l n="111">Despite his pomp and circumstance , the Queen</l>

     <l n="114">A fellow made of bronze , a buccaneer ,</l>
     <l n="115">Maned like a lion , bearded like a pard ,</l>
     <l n="116">With hammered head , clamped jaws , and great deep eyes</l>
     <l n="117">That burned with fierce blue colours of the brine ,</l>
     <l n="118">And liked not Spain — Drake ! ‘ Twas the very name ,</l>
     <l n="119">One Francis Drake ! a Titan that had stood ,</l>
     <l n="120">Thundering commands against the thundering heavens ,</l>
     <l n="121">On lightning-shattered , storm-swept decks and drunk</l>
     <l n="122">Great draughts of glory from the rolling sea ,</l>

     <l n="127">Vainly the Spaniard raged</l>
     <l n="128">Of restitution , recompense ; for now</l>
     <l n="129">Had Drake brought up the little Golden Hynde</l>
     <l n="130">To London , and the rumor of her wealth</l>
     <l n="131">Out-topped the wild reality . The crew</l>
     <l n="132">Were princes as they swaggered down the streets</l>
     <l n="133">In weather-beaten splendour . Out of their doors</l>
     <l n="134">To wonder and stare the jostling citizens ran</l>
     <l n="135">When They went by ; and through the length and breadth</l>
     <l n="136">Of England , now , the gathering glory of life</l>
     <l n="137">Shone like the dawn . O'er hill and dale it streamed ,</l>
     <l n="138">Dawn , everlasting and almighty dawn ,</l>
     <l n="139">Making a golden pomp of every oak —</l>
     <l n="140">Had not its British brethren swept the seas ?—</l>
     <l n="141">In each remotest hamlet , by the hearth ,</l>
     <l n="142">The cart , the grey church-porch , the village pump</l>
     <l n="143">By meadow and mill and old manorial hall ,</l>
     <l n="144">By turnpike and by tavern , farm and forge ,</l>
     <l n="145">Men staved the crimson vintage of romance</l>
     <l n="146">And held it up against the light and drank it ,</l>
     <l n="147">And with it drank confusion to the wrath</l>
     <l n="148">That menaced England , but eternal honour ,</l>
     <l n="149">While blood ran in their veins , to Francis Drake .</l>

     <l n="79">Of vaster privateerings planned by Drake</l>
     <l n="80">Against the coasts of Philip ; but held in check</l>
     <l n="81">And fretting at the leash , as ever the Queen</l>
     <l n="82">Clung to her statecraft , while Drake 's enemies</l>
     <l n="83">Worked in the dark against him . Spain had set</l>
     <l n="84">An emperor 's ransom on his life . At home</l>
     <l n="85">John Doughty , treacherous brother of that traitor</l>
     <l n="86">Who met his doom by Drake 's own hand , intrigued</l>
     <l n="87">With Spain abroad and Spain 's dark emissaries</l>
     <l n="88">At home to avenge his brother . Burleigh still</l>
     <l n="89">Beset Drake 's path with pitfalls : treacherous greed</l>
     <l n="90">For Spain 's blood-money daggered all the dark</l>
     <l n="91">Around him , and John Doughty without cease</l>
     <l n="92">Sought to make use of all ; until , by chance ,</l>
     <l n="93">Drake gat the proof of treasonable intrigue</l>
     <l n="94">With Spain , against him , up to the deadly hilt ,</l>
     <l n="95">And hurled him into the Tower .</l>
     <l n="96">Many a night</l>
     <l n="97">She sat by that old casement nigh the sea</l>
     <l n="98">And heard its ebb and flow . With soul erect</l>
     <l n="99">And splendid now she waited , yet there came</l>
     <l n="100">No message ; and , she thought , he hath seen at last</l>
     <l n="101">My little worth . And when her maiden sang ,</l>
     <l n="102">With white throat throbbing softly in the dusk</l>
     <l n="103">And fingers gently straying o'er the lute ,</l>
     <l n="104">As was her wont at twilight , some old song</l>
     <l n="105">Of high disdainful queens and lovers pale</l>
     <l n="106">Pining a thousand years before their feet ,</l>
     <l n="107">She thought , “ O , if my lover loved me yet</l>
     <l n="108">My heart would break for joy to welcome him :</l>
     <l n="109">Perchance his true pride will not let him come</l>
     <l n="110">Since false pride barred him out ” ; and yet again</l>
     <l n="111">She burned with shame , thinking , “ to him such pride</l>
     <l n="112">Were matter for a jest . Ah no , he hath seen</l>
     <l n="113">My little worth . ” Even so , one night she sat ,</l>
     <l n="114">One dark rich summer night , thinking him far</l>
     <l n="115">Away , wrapped in the multitudinous cares</l>
     <l n="116">Of one that seemed the steersman of the State</l>
     <l n="117">Now , thro ’ the storm of Europe ; while her maid</l>
     <l n="118">Sang to the lute , and soft sea-breezes brought</l>
     <l n="119">Wreathed scents and sighs of secret waves and flowers</l>
     <l n="120">Warm through the casement 's muffling jasmine bloom .</l>

      <l n="28">The song ceased only as if that small bird-throat</l>
      <l n="29">Availed no further . Would the next great chord</l>
      <l n="30">Ring out from harps in flaming seraph hands</l>
      <l n="31">Ranged through the sky ? The night watched , breathless , dumb .</l>
      <l n="32">Bess listened . Once again a dry twig snapped</l>
      <l n="33">Beneath her casement , and a face looked up ,</l>
      <l n="34">Draining her face of blood , of sight , of life ,</l>
      <l n="35">Whispering , a voice from far beyond the stars ,</l>
      <l n="36">Whispering , unutterable joy , the whole</l>
      <l n="37">Glory of life and death in one small word —</l>
      <l n="38">Sweetheart !</l>
      <l n="39">The jasmine at her casement shook ,</l>
      <l n="40">She knew no more than he was at her side ,</l>
      <l n="41">His arms were round her , and his breath beat warm</l>
      <l n="42">Against her cheek .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="3">
      <l n="43">Suddenly , nigh the house ,</l>
      <l n="44">A deep-mouthed mastiff bayed and a foot crunched</l>
      <l n="45">The gravel . “ Hark ! they are watching for thee , ” she cried .</l>
      <l n="46">He laughed : “ There 's half of Europe on the watch</l>
      <l n="47">Outside for my poor head , ‘ Tis cosier here</l>
      <l n="48">With thee ; but now ” — his face grew grave , he drew</l>
      <l n="49">A silken ladder from his doublet — “ quick ,</l>
      <l n="50">Before yon good gamekeeper rounds the house</l>
      <l n="51">We must be down . ” And ere the words were out</l>
      <l n="52">Bess reached the path , and Drake was at her side .</l>
      <l n="53">Then into the star-stabbed shadow of the woods</l>
      <l n="54">They sped , his arm around her . Suddenly</l>
      <l n="55">She drew back with a cry , as four grim faces ,</l>
      <l n="56">With hand to forelock , glimmered in their way .</l>
      <l n="57">Laughing she saw their storm-beat friendly smile</l>
      <l n="58">Welcome their doughty captain in this new</l>
      <l n="59">Adventure . Far away , once more they heard</l>
      <l n="60">The mastiff bay ; then nearer , as if his nose</l>
      <l n="61">Were down upon the trail ; and then a cry</l>
      <l n="62">As of a hot pursuit . They reached the brook ,</l>
      <l n="63">Hurrying to the deep . Drake lifted Bess</l>
      <l n="64">In his arms , and down the watery bed they splashed</l>
      <l n="65">To baffle the clamouring hunt . Then out of the woods</l>
      <l n="66">They came , on the seaward side , and Bess , with a shiver ,</l>
      <l n="67">Saw starlight flashing from bare cutlasses ,</l>
      <l n="68">As the mastiff bayed still nearer . Swiftlier now</l>
      <l n="69">They passed along the bare blunt cliffs and saw</l>
      <l n="70">The furrow ploughed by that strange cannon-shot</l>
      <l n="71">Which saved this hour for Bess ; down to the beach</l>
      <l n="72">And starry foam that churned the silver gravel</l>
      <l n="73">Around an old black lurching boat , a strange</l>
      <l n="74">Grim Charon 's wherry for two lovers ’ flight ,</l>
      <l n="75">Guarded by old Tom Moone . Drake took her hand ,</l>
      <l n="76">And with one arm around her waist , her breath</l>
      <l n="77">Warm on his cheek for a moment , in she stepped</l>
      <l n="78">Daintily o'er the gunwale , and took her seat ,</l>
      <l n="79">His throned princess , beside him at the helm ,</l>
      <l n="80">Backed by the glittering waves , his throned princess ,</l>
      <l n="81">With jewelled throat and glorious hair that seemed</l>
      <l n="82">Flashing back scents and colours to a sea</l>
      <l n="83">Which lived but to reflect her loveliness .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="4">
      <l n="84">Then , all together , with their brandished oars</l>
      <l n="85">The seamen thrust as a heavy mounded wave</l>
      <l n="86">Lifted the boat ; and up the flowering breast</l>
      <l n="87">Of the next they soared , then settled at the thwarts ,</l>
      <l n="88">And the fierce water boiled before their blades</l>
      <l n="89">While with Drake 's iron hand upon the helm</l>
      <l n="90">They plunged and ploughed across the starlit seas</l>
      <l n="91">To where a small black lugger at anchor swung ,</l>
      <l n="92">Dipping her rakish brow i ’ the liquid moon .</l>
      <l n="93">Small was she , but not fangless ; for Bess saw ,</l>
      <l n="94">With half a tremor , the dumb protective grin</l>
      <l n="95">Of four grim guns above the tossing boat .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="5">
      <l n="96">But ere his seamen or his sweetheart knew</l>
      <l n="97">What power , as of a wind , bore them along ,</l>
      <l n="98">Anchor was up , the sails were broken out ,</l>
      <l n="99">And as they scudded down the dim grey coast</l>
      <l n="100">Of a new enchanted world ( for now had Love</l>
      <l n="101">Made all things new and strange ) the skilled musicians</l>
      <l n="102">Upraised , at Drake 's command , a song to cheer</l>
      <l n="103">Their midnight path across that faery sea .</l>

      <l n="53">Shone with a mystic beauty for those twain</l>
      <l n="54">Who watched the gathering glory ; and , in an hour ,</l>
      <l n="55">Drake and sweet Bess , attended by a guard</l>
      <l n="56">Of four swart seamen , with bare cutlasses ,</l>
      <l n="57">And by the faithful eyes of old Tom Moone ,</l>
      <l n="58">Went up the rough rock-steps and twisted street</l>
      <l n="59">O ’ the small white sparkling seaport , tow'rds the church</l>
      <l n="60">Where , hand in hand , before God 's altar they ,</l>
      <l n="61">With steadfast eyes , did plight eternal troth ,</l>
      <l n="62">And so were wedded . Never a chime of bells</l>
      <l n="63">Had they : but as they passed from out the porch</l>
      <l n="64">Between the sleeping graves , a skylark soared</l>
      <l n="65">Above the world in an ecstasy of song ,</l>
      <l n="66">And quivering heavenwards , lost himself in light .</l>

     <l n="1">Now like a white-cliffed fortress England shone</l>
     <l n="2">Amid the mirk of chaos ; for the huge</l>
     <l n="3">Empire of Spain was but the dusky van</l>
     <l n="4">Of that dread night beyond all nights and days ,</l>
     <l n="5">Night of the last corruption of a world</l>
     <l n="6">Fast-bound in misery and iron , with chains</l>
     <l n="7">Of priest and king and feudal servitude ,</l>
     <l n="8">Night of the fettered flesh and ravaged soul ,</l>
     <l n="9">Night of anarchic chaos , darkening the deep ,</l>
     <l n="10">Swallowing up cities , kingdoms , empires , gods ,</l>
     <l n="11">With vaster gloom approaching , till the sun</l>
     <l n="12">Of love was blackened , the moon of faith was blood .</l>
     <l n="13">All round our England , our small struggling star ,</l>
     <l n="14">Fortress of freedom , rock o ’ the world 's desire ,</l>
     <l n="15">Bearing at last the hope of all mankind ,</l>
     <l n="16">The thickening darkness surged , and close at hand</l>
     <l n="17">Those first fierce cloudy fringes of the storm ,</l>
     <l n="18">The Armada sails , gathered their might ; and Spain</l>
     <l n="19">Crouched close behind them with her screaming fires</l>
     <l n="20">And steaming shambles , Spain , the hell-hag , crouched ,</l>
     <l n="21">Still grasping with red hand the cross of Christ</l>
     <l n="22">By its great hilt , pointing it like a dagger ,</l>
     <l n="23">Spear-head of the ultimate darkness , at the throat</l>
     <l n="24">Of England . Under Philip 's feet at last</l>
     <l n="25">Writhed all the Protestant Netherlands , dim coasts</l>
     <l n="26">Right over against us , whence his panoplies</l>
     <l n="27">Might suddenly whelm our isle . But all night long ,</l>
     <l n="28">On many a mountain , many a guardian height ,</l>
     <l n="29">From Beachy Head to Skiddaw , little groups</l>
     <l n="30">Of seamen , torch and battle-lanthorn nigh ,</l>
     <l n="31">Watched by the brooding unlit beacons , piled</l>
     <l n="32">Of sun-dried gorse , funereal peat , rough logs ,</l>
     <l n="33">Reeking with oil , ‘ mid sharp scents of the sea ,</l>
     <l n="34">Waste trampled grass and heather and close-cropped thyme ,</l>
     <l n="35">High o'er the thundering coast , among whose rocks</l>
     <l n="36">Far , far below , the pacing coastguards gazed</l>
     <l n="37">Steadfastly seaward through the loaded dusk .</l>
     <l n="38">And through that deepening gloom when , as it seemed ,</l>
     <l n="39">All England held her breath in one grim doubt ,</l>
     <l n="40">Swift rumours flashed from North to South as runs</l>
     <l n="41">The lightning round a silent thunder-cloud ;</l>
     <l n="42">And there were muttering crowds in the London streets ,</l>
     <l n="43">And hurrying feet in the brooding Eastern ports .</l>
     <l n="44">All night , dark inns , gathering the country-side ,</l>
     <l n="45">Reddened with clashing auguries of war .</l>
     <l n="46">All night , in the ships of Plymouth Sound , the soul</l>
     <l n="47">Of Francis Drake was England , and all night</l>
     <l n="48">Her singing seamen by the silver quays</l>
     <l n="49">Polished their guns and waited for the dawn .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="50">But hour by hour that night grew deeper . Spain</l>
     <l n="51">Watched , cloud by cloud , her huge Armadas grow ,</l>
     <l n="52">Watched , tower by tower , and zone by zone , her fleets</l>
     <l n="53">Grapple the sky with a hundred hands and drag</l>
     <l n="54">Whole sea-horizons into her menacing ranks ,</l>
     <l n="55">Joining her powers to the fierce night , while Philip</l>
     <l n="56">Still strove , with many a crafty word , to lull</l>
     <l n="57">The fears of Gloriana , till his plots</l>
     <l n="58">Were ripe , his armaments complete ; and still</l>
     <l n="59">Great Gloriana took her woman 's way ,</l>
     <l n="60">Preferring ever tortuous intrigue</l>
     <l n="61">To battle , since the stakes had grown so great ;</l>
     <l n="62">Now , more than ever , hoping against hope</l>
     <l n="63">To find some subtler means of victory ;</l>
     <l n="64">Yet not without swift impulses to strike ,</l>
     <l n="65">Swiftly recalled . Blind , yet not blind , she smiled</l>
     <l n="66">On Mary of Scotland waiting for her throne ,</l>
     <l n="67">A throne with many a strange dark tremor thrilled</l>
     <l n="68">Now as the rumoured murderous mines below</l>
     <l n="69">Converged towards it , mine and countermine ,</l>
     <l n="70">Till the live earth was honeycombed with death .</l>
     <l n="71">Still with her agate smile , still she delayed ,</l>
     <l n="72">Holding her pirate admiral in the leash</l>
     <l n="73">Till Walsingham , nay , even the hunchback Burleigh ,</l>
     <l n="74">That crafty king of statesmen , seeing at last</l>
     <l n="75">The inevitable thunder-crash at hand .</l>
     <l n="76">Grew heart-sick with delay and ached to shatter</l>
     <l n="77">The tense tremendous hush that seemed to oppress</l>
     <l n="78">All hearts , compress all brows , load the broad night</l>
     <l n="79">With more than mortal menace .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="80">Only once</l>
     <l n="81">The night was traversed with one lightning flash ,</l>
     <l n="82">One rapier stroke from England , at the heart</l>
     <l n="83">Of Spain , as swiftly parried , yet no less</l>
     <l n="84">A fiery challenge ; for Philip 's hate and scorn</l>
     <l n="85">Growing with his Armada 's growth , he lured</l>
     <l n="86">With promises of just and friendly trade</l>
     <l n="87">A fleet of English corn-ships to relieve</l>
     <l n="88">His famine-stricken coast . There as they lay</l>
     <l n="89">Within his ports he seized them , one and all ,</l>
     <l n="90">To fill the Armada 's maw .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="91">Whereat the Queen ,</l>
     <l n="92">Passive so long , summoned great Walsingham ,</l>
     <l n="93">And , still averse from open war , despite</l>
     <l n="94">The battle-hunger burning in his eyes ,</l>
     <l n="95">With one strange swift sharp agate smile she hissed ,</l>
     <l n="96">“ Unchain El Draque ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="97">A lightning flash indeed</l>
     <l n="98">Was this ; for he whose little Golden Hynde</l>
     <l n="99">With scarce a score of seamen late had scourged</l>
     <l n="100">The Spanish Main ; he whose piratic neck</l>
     <l n="101">Scarcely the Queen 's most wily statecraft saved</l>
     <l n="102">From Spain 's revenge : he , privateer to the eyes</l>
     <l n="103">Of Spain , but England to all English hearts ,</l>
     <l n="104">Gathered together , in all good jollity ,</l>
     <l n="105">All help and furtherance himself could wish ,</l>
     <l n="106">Before that moon was out , a pirate fleet</l>
     <l n="107">Whereof the like old ocean had not seen —</l>
     <l n="108">Eighteen swift cruisers , two great battleships ,</l>
     <l n="109">With pinnaces and store-ships and a force</l>
     <l n="110">Of nigh three thousand men , wherewith to singe</l>
     <l n="111">The beard o ’ the King of Spain .</l>
     <l n="112">By night they gathered</l>
     <l n="113">In marvellous wind-whipt inns nigh Plymouth Sound ,</l>
     <l n="114">Not secretly as , ere the Golden Hynde</l>
     <l n="115">Burst thro ’ the West , that small adventurous crew</l>
     <l n="116">Gathered beside the Thames , tossing the phrase</l>
     <l n="117">“ Pieces of eight ” from mouth to mouth , and singing</l>
     <l n="118">Great songs of the rich Indies , and those tall</l>
     <l n="119">Enchanted galleons , red with blood and gold ,</l>
     <l n="120">Superb with rubies , glorious as clouds ,</l>
     <l n="121">Clouds in the sun , with mighty press of sail</l>
     <l n="122">Dragging the sunset out of the unknown world ,</l>
     <l n="123">And staining all the grey old seas of Time</l>
     <l n="124">With rich romance ; but these , though privateers ,</l>
     <l n="125">Or secret knights on Gloriana 's quest ,</l>
     <l n="126">Recked not if round the glowing magic door</l>
     <l n="127">Of every inn the townsfolk grouped to hear</l>
     <l n="128">The storm-scarred seamen toasting Francis Drake ,</l>
     <l n="129">Nor heeded what blithe urchin faces pressed</l>
     <l n="130">On each red-curtained magic casement , bright</l>
     <l n="131">With wild reflection of the fires within ,</l>
     <l n="132">The fires , the glasses , and the singing lips</l>
     <l n="133">Lifting defiance to the powers of Spain .</l>

     <l n="42">One night as , with his great vice-admiral ,</l>
     <l n="43">Frobisher , his rear-admiral , Francis Knollys ,</l>
     <l n="44">And Thomas Fenner , his flag-captain , Drake</l>
     <l n="45">Took counsel at his tavern , there came a knock ,</l>
     <l n="46">The door opened , and cold as from the sea</l>
     <l n="47">The gloom rushed in , and there against the night ,</l>
     <l n="48">Clad as it seemed with wind and cloud and rain ,</l>
     <l n="49">Glittered a courtier whom by face and form</l>
     <l n="50">All knew for the age 's brilliant paladin ,</l>
     <l n="51">Sidney , the king of courtesy , a star</l>
     <l n="52">Of chivalry . The seamen stared at him ,</l>
     <l n="53">Each with a hand upon the red-lined chart</l>
     <l n="54">Outspread before them . Then all stared at Drake ,</l>
     <l n="55">Who crouched like a great bloodhound o'er the table ,</l>
     <l n="56">And rose with a strange light burning in his eyes ;</l>
     <l n="57">For he remembered how , three years agone ,</l>
     <l n="58">That other courtier came , with words and smiles</l>
     <l n="59">Copied from Sidney 's self ; and in his ears</l>
     <l n="60">Rang once again the sound of the two-edged sword</l>
     <l n="61">Upon the desolate Patagonian shore</l>
     <l n="62">Beneath Magellan 's gallows . With a voice</l>
     <l n="63">So harsh himself scarce knew it , he desired</l>
     <l n="64">This fair new courtier 's errand . With grim eyes</l>
     <l n="65">He scanned the silken knight from head to foot ,</l>
     <l n="66">While Sidney , smiling graciously , besought</l>
     <l n="67">Some place in their adventure . Drake 's clenched fist</l>
     <l n="68">Crashed down on the old oak table like a rock ,</l>
     <l n="69">Splintering the wood and dashing his rough wrist</l>
     <l n="70">With blood , as he thundered , “ By the living God ,</l>
     <l n="71">No ! We 've no room for courtiers , now ! We leave</l>
     <l n="72">All that to Spain . ”</l>
     <l n="73">Whereat , seeing Sidney stood</l>
     <l n="74">Amazed , Drake , drawing nearer , said , “ You ask</l>
     <l n="75">More than you dream : I know you for a knight</l>
     <l n="76">Most perfect and most gentle , yea , a man</l>
     <l n="77">Ready to die on any battle-field</l>
     <l n="78">To save a wounded friend ” ( even so said Drake ,</l>
     <l n="79">Not knowing how indeed this knight would die ) ,</l>
     <l n="80">Then fiercely he outstretched his bleeding hand</l>
     <l n="81">And pointed through the door to where the gloom</l>
     <l n="82">Glimmered with bursting spray , and the thick night</l>
     <l n="83">Was all one wandering thunder of hidden seas</l>
     <l n="84">Rolling out of Eternity : “ You 'll find</l>
     <l n="85">No purple fields of Arcady out there ,</l>
     <l n="86">No shepherds piping in those boisterous valleys ,</l>
     <l n="87">No sheep among those roaring mountain-tops ,</l>
     <l n="88">No lists of feudal chivalry . I 've heard</l>
     <l n="89">That voice cry death to courtiers . ‘ Tis God 's voice .</l>
     <l n="90">Take you the word of one who has occupied</l>
     <l n="91">His business in great waters . There 's no room ,</l>
     <l n="92">Meaning , or reason , office , or place , or name</l>
     <l n="93">For courtiers on the sea . Does the sea flatter ?</l>
     <l n="94">You cannot bribe it , torture it , or tame it !</l>
     <l n="95">Its laws are those of the Juggernaut universe ,</l>
     <l n="96">Remorseless — listen to that ! ” — a mighty wave</l>
     <l n="97">Broke thundering down the coast ; “ your hands are white ,</l>
     <l n="98">Your rapier jewelled , can you grapple that ?</l>
     <l n="99">What part have you in all its flaming ways ?</l>
     <l n="100">What share in its fierce gloom ? Has your heart broken</l>
     <l n="101">As those waves break out there ? Can you lie down</l>
     <l n="102">And sleep , as a lion-cub by the old lion ,</l>
     <l n="103">When it shakes its mane out over you to hide you ,</l>
     <l n="104">And leap out with the dawn as I have done ?</l>
     <l n="105">These are big words ; but , see , my hand is red :</l>
     <l n="106">You cannot torture me , I have borne all that ;</l>
     <l n="107">And so I have some kinship with the sea ,</l>
     <l n="108">Some sort of wild alliance with its storms ,</l>
     <l n="109">Its exultations , ay , and its great wrath</l>
     <l n="110">At last , and power upon them . ‘ Tis the worse</l>
     <l n="111">For Spain , Be counselled well : come not between</l>
     <l n="112">My sea and its rich vengeance . ”</l>
     <l n="113">Silently ,</l>
     <l n="114">Bowing his head , Sidney withdrew . But Drake ,</l>
     <l n="115">So fiercely the old grief rankled in his heart ,</l>
     <l n="116">Summoned his swiftest horseman , bidding him ride ,</l>
     <l n="117">Ride like the wind through the night , straight to the Queen ,</l>
     <l n="118">Praying she would most instantly recall</l>
     <l n="119">Her truant courtier . Nay , to make all sure ,</l>
     <l n="120">Drake sent a gang of seamen out to crouch</l>
     <l n="121">Ambushed in woody hollows nigh the road ,</l>
     <l n="122">Under the sailing moon , there to waylay</l>
     <l n="123">The Queen 's reply , that she might never know</l>
     <l n="124">It reached him , if it proved against his will .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="125">And swiftly came that truant 's stern recall ;</l>
     <l n="126">But Drake , in hourly dread of some new change</l>
     <l n="127">In Gloriana 's mood , slept not by night</l>
     <l n="128">Or day , till out of roaring Plymouth Sound</l>
     <l n="129">The pirate fleet swept to the wind-swept main ,</l>
     <l n="130">And took the wind and shook out all its sails .</l>
     <l n="131">Then with the unfettered sea he mixed his soul</l>
     <l n="132">In great rejoicing union , while the ships</l>
     <l n="133">Crashing and soaring o'er the heart-free waves</l>
     <l n="134">Drave ever straight for Spain .</l>
     <l n="135">Water and food</l>
     <l n="136">They lacked ; but the fierce fever of his mind</l>
     <l n="137">To sail from Plymouth ere the Queen 's will changed</l>
     <l n="138">Had left no time for these . Right on he drave ,</l>
     <l n="139">Determining , though the Queen 's old officers</l>
     <l n="140">Beneath him stood appalled , to take in stores</l>
     <l n="141">Of all he needed , water , powder , food ,</l>
     <l n="142">By plunder of Spain herself . In Vigo bay ,</l>
     <l n="143">Close to Bayona town , under the cliffs</l>
     <l n="144">Of Spain 's world-wide and thunder-fraught prestige</l>
     <l n="145">He anchored , with the old sea-touch that wakes</l>
     <l n="146">Our England still . There , in the tingling ears</l>
     <l n="147">Of the world he cried , En garde ! to the King of Spain .</l>
     <l n="148">There , ordering out his pinnaces in force ,</l>
     <l n="149">While a great storm , as if he held indeed</l>
     <l n="150">Heaven 's batteries in reserve , growled o'er the sea ,</l>
     <l n="151">He landed . Ere one cumbrous limb of all</l>
     <l n="152">The monstrous armaments of Spain could move</l>
     <l n="153">His ships were stored ; and ere the sword of Spain</l>
     <l n="154">Stirred in its crusted sheath , Bayona town</l>
     <l n="155">Beheld an empty sea ; for like a dream</l>
     <l n="156">The pirate fleet had vanished , none knew whither .</l>
     <l n="157">But , in its visible stead , invisible fear</l>
     <l n="158">Filled the vast rondure of the sea and sky</l>
     <l n="159">As with the omnipresent soul of Drake .</l>
     <l n="160">For when Spain saw the small black anchored fleet</l>
     <l n="161">Ride in her bays , the sight set bounds to fear .</l>
     <l n="162">She knew at least the ships were oak , the guns</l>
     <l n="163">Of common range : nor did she dream e'en Drake</l>
     <l n="164">Could sail two seas at once . Now all her coasts</l>
     <l n="165">Heard him all night in every bursting wave ,</l>
     <l n="166">His topsails gleamed in every moonlit cloud ;</l>
     <l n="167">His battle-lanthorn glittered in the stars</l>
     <l n="168">That hung the low horizon . He became</l>
     <l n="169">A universal menace ; yet there followed</l>
     <l n="170">No sight or sound of him , unless the sea</l>
     <l n="171">Were that grim soul incarnate . Did it not roar</l>
     <l n="172">His great commands ? The very spray that lashed</l>
     <l n="173">The cheeks of Spanish seamen lashed their hearts</l>
     <l n="174">To helpless hatred of him . The wind sang</l>
     <l n="175">El Draque across the rattling blocks and sheets</l>
     <l n="176">When storms perplexed them ; and when ships went down ,</l>
     <l n="177">As under the fury of his onsetting battle ,</l>
     <l n="178">The drowning sailors cursed him while they sank .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="179">Suddenly a rumour shook the Spanish Court ,</l>
     <l n="180">He has gone once more to the Indies . Santa Cruz ,</l>
     <l n="181">High Admiral of Spain , the most renowned</l>
     <l n="182">Captain in Europe , clamoured for a fleet</l>
     <l n="183">Of forty sail instantly to pursue .</l>
     <l n="184">For unto him whose little Golden Hynde</l>
     <l n="185">Was weapon enough , now leading such a squadron ,</l>
     <l n="186">The West Indies , the whole Pacific coast ,</l>
     <l n="187">And the whole Spanish Main , lay at his mercy .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="188">And onward over the great grey gleaming sea</l>
     <l n="189">Swept like a thunder-cloud the pirate fleet</l>
     <l n="190">With vengeance in its heart . Five years agone ,</l>
     <l n="191">Young Hawkins , in the Cape Verde Islands , met —</l>
     <l n="192">At Santiago — with such treachery</l>
     <l n="193">As Drake burned to requite , and from that hour</l>
     <l n="194">Was Santiago doomed . His chance had come ;</l>
     <l n="195">Drake swooped upon it , plundered it , and was gone ,</l>
     <l n="196">Leaving the treacherous isle a desolate heap</l>
     <l n="197">Of smoking ashes in the leaden sea ,</l>
     <l n="198">While onward all those pirate bowsprits plunged</l>
     <l n="199">Into the golden West , across the broad</l>
     <l n="200">Atlantic once again ; “ For I will show , ”</l>
     <l n="201">Said Drake , “ that Englishmen henceforth will sail</l>
     <l n="202">Old ocean where they will . ” Onward they surged ,</l>
     <l n="203">And the great glittering crested majestic waves</l>
     <l n="204">Jubilantly rushed up to meet the keels ,</l>
     <l n="205">And there was nought around them but the grey</l>
     <l n="206">Ruin and roar of the huge Atlantic seas ,</l>
     <l n="207">Grey mounded seas , pursuing and pursued ,</l>
     <l n="208">That fly , hounded and hounding on for ever ,</l>
     <l n="209">From empty marge to marge of the grey sky .</l>
     <l n="210">Over the wandering wilderness of foam ,</l>
     <l n="211">Onward , through storm and death , Drake swept ; for now</l>
     <l n="212">Once more a fell plague gripped the tossing ships ,</l>
     <l n="213">And not by twos and threes as heretofore</l>
     <l n="214">His crews were minished ; but in three black days</l>
     <l n="215">Three hundred seamen in their shotted shrouds</l>
     <l n="216">Were cast into the deep . Onward he swept ,</l>
     <l n="217">Implacably , having in mind to strike</l>
     <l n="218">Spain in the throat at St. Domingo , port</l>
     <l n="219">Of Hispaniola , a city of far renown ,</l>
     <l n="220">A jewel on the shores of old romance ,</l>
     <l n="221">Palm-shadowed , gated with immortal gold ,</l>
     <l n="222">Queen city of Spain 's dominions over sea ,</l>
     <l n="223">And guarded by great guns . Out of the dawn</l>
     <l n="224">The pirate ships came leaping , grim and black ,</l>
     <l n="225">And ere the Spaniards were awake , the flag</l>
     <l n="226">Of England floated from their topmost tower .</l>
     <l n="227">But since he had not troops enough to hold</l>
     <l n="228">So great a city , Drake entrenched his men</l>
     <l n="229">Within the Plaza and held the batteries .</l>
     <l n="230">Thence he demanded ransom , and sent out</l>
     <l n="231">A boy with flag of truce . The boy 's return</l>
     <l n="232">Drake waited long . Under a sheltering palm</l>
     <l n="233">He stood , watching the enemies ’ camp , and lo ,</l>
     <l n="234">Along the hot white purple-shadowed road</l>
     <l n="235">Tow'rds him , a crawling shape writhed through the dust</l>
     <l n="236">Up to his feet , a shape besmeared with blood ,</l>
     <l n="237">A shape that held the stumps up of its wrists</l>
     <l n="238">And moaned , an eyeless thing , a naked rag</l>
     <l n="239">Of flesh obscenely mangled , a small face</l>
     <l n="240">Hideously puckered , shrivelled like a monkey 's</l>
     <l n="241">With lips drawn backward from its teeth .</l>
     <l n="242">“ Speak , speak ,</l>
     <l n="243">In God 's name , speak , what art thou ? ” whispered Drake ,</l>
     <l n="244">And a sharp cry came , answering his dread ,</l>
     <l n="245">A cry as of a sea-bird in the wind</l>
     <l n="246">Desolately astray from all earth 's shores ,</l>
     <l n="247">“ Captain , I am thy boy , only thy boy !</l>
     <l n="248">See , see , my captain , see what they have done !</l>
     <l n="249">Captain , I only bore the flag ; I only —— ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="250">“ O , lad , lad , lad , ” moaned Drake , and , stooping , strove</l>
     <l n="251">To pillow the mangled head upon his arm .</l>
     <l n="252">“ What have they done to thee , what have they done ? ”</l>
     <l n="253">And at the touch the boy screamed , once , and died .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="254">Then like a savage sea with arms uplift</l>
     <l n="255">To heaven the wrath of Drake blazed thundering ,</l>
     <l n="256">“ Eternal God , be this the doom of Spain !</l>
     <l n="257">Henceforward have no pity . Send the strength</l>
     <l n="258">Of Thy great seas into my soul that I</l>
     <l n="259">May devastate this empire , this red hell</l>
     <l n="260">They make of Thy good earth . ”</l>
     <l n="261">His men drew round ,</l>
     <l n="262">Staring in horror at the silent shape</l>
     <l n="263">That daubed his feet . Like a cold wind</l>
     <l n="264">His words went through their flesh :</l>
     <l n="265">“ This is the lad</l>
     <l n="266">That bore our flag of truce . This hath Spain done .</l>
     <l n="267">Look well upon it , draw the smoke of the blood</l>
     <l n="268">Up into your nostrils , my companions ,</l>
     <l n="269">And down into your souls . This makes an end</l>
     <l n="270">For Spain ! Bring forth the Spanish prisoners</l>
     <l n="271">And let me look on them . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="272">Forth they were brought ,</l>
     <l n="273">A swarthy gorgeous band of soldiers , priests ,</l>
     <l n="274">And sailors , hedged between two sturdy files</l>
     <l n="275">Of British tars with naked cutlasses .</l>
     <l n="276">Close up to Drake they halted , under the palm ,</l>
     <l n="277">Gay smiling prisoners , for they thought their friends</l>
     <l n="278">Had ransomed them . Then they looked up and met</l>
     <l n="279">A glance that swept athwart them like a sword ,</l>
     <l n="280">Making the blood strain back from their blanched faces</l>
     <l n="281">Into their quivering hearts , with unknown dread ,</l>
     <l n="282">As that accuser pointed to the shape</l>
     <l n="283">Before his feet .</l>
     <l n="284">“ Dogs , will ye lap his blood</l>
     <l n="285">Before ye die ? Make haste ; for it grows cold !</l>
     <l n="286">Ye will not , will not even dabble your hands</l>
     <l n="287">In that red puddle of flesh , what ? Are ye Spaniards ?</l>
     <l n="288">Come , come , I 'll look at you , perchance there 's one</l>
     <l n="289">That 's but a demi-devil and holds you back . ”</l>
     <l n="290">And with the word Drake stepped among their ranks</l>
     <l n="291">And read each face among the swarthy crew —</l>
     <l n="292">The gorgeous soldiers , ringleted sailors , priests</l>
     <l n="293">With rosary and cross , a slender page</l>
     <l n="294">In scarlet with a cloud of golden hair ,</l>
     <l n="295">And two rope-girdled friars .</l>
     <l n="296">The slim page</l>
     <l n="297">Drake drew before the throng . “ You are young , ” he said ,</l>
     <l n="298">“ Go ; take this message to the camp of Spain :</l>
     <l n="299">Tell them I have a hunger in my soul</l>
     <l n="300">To look upon the murderers of this boy ,</l>
     <l n="301">To see what eyes they have , what manner of mouths ,</l>
     <l n="302">To touch them and to take their hands in mine ,</l>
     <l n="303">And draw them close to me and smile upon them</l>
     <l n="304">Until they know my soul as I know theirs ,</l>
     <l n="305">And they grovel in the dust and grope for mercy .</l>
     <l n="306">Say that , until I get them , every day</l>
     <l n="307">I 'll hang two Spaniards though I dispeople</l>
     <l n="308">The Spanish Main . Tell them that , every day ,</l>
     <l n="309">I 'll burn a portion of their city down ,</l>
     <l n="310">Then find another city and burn that ,</l>
     <l n="311">And then burn others till I burn away</l>
     <l n="312">Their empire from the world , ay , till I reach</l>
     <l n="313">The Imperial throne of Philip with my fires ,</l>
     <l n="314">And send it shrieking down to burn in hell</l>
     <l n="315">For ever . Go ! ”</l>
     <l n="316">Then Drake turned once again ,</l>
     <l n="317">To face the Spanish prisoners . With a voice</l>
     <l n="318">Cold as the passionless utterance of Fate</l>
     <l n="319">His grim command went forth . “ Now , provost-marshal ,</l>
     <l n="320">Begin with yon two friars , in whose faces</l>
     <l n="321">Chined like singed swine , and eyed with the spent coals</l>
     <l n="322">Of filthy living , sweats the glory of Spain .</l>
     <l n="323">Strip off their leprous rags</l>
     <l n="324">And twist their ropes around their throats and hang them</l>
     <l n="325">High over the Spanish camp for all to see .</l>
     <l n="326">At dawn I 'll choose two more . ”</l>

     <l n="1">Across the Atlantic</l>
     <l n="2">Great rumours rushed as of a mighty wind ,</l>
     <l n="3">The wind of the spirit of Drake . But who shall tell</l>
     <l n="4">In this cold age the power that he became</l>
     <l n="5">Who drew the universe within his soul</l>
     <l n="6">And moved with cosmic forces ? Though the deep</l>
     <l n="7">Divided it from Drake , the gorgeous court</l>
     <l n="8">Of Philip shuddered away from the streaming coasts</l>
     <l n="9">As a wind-cuffed field of golden wheat . The King ,</l>
     <l n="10">Bidding his guests to a feast in his own ship</l>
     <l n="11">On that wind-darkened sea , was made a mock ,</l>
     <l n="12">As one by one his ladies proffered excuse</l>
     <l n="13">For fear of That beyond . Round Europe now</l>
     <l n="14">Ballad and story told how in the cabin</l>
     <l n="15">Of Francis Drake there hung a magic glass</l>
     <l n="16">Wherein he saw the fleets of every foe</l>
     <l n="17">And all that passed aboard them . Rome herself ,</l>
     <l n="18">Perplexed that this proud heretic should prevail ,</l>
     <l n="19">Fostered a darker dream , that Drake had bought ,</l>
     <l n="20">Like old Norse wizards , power to loose or bind</l>
     <l n="21">The winds at will .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="22">And now a wilder tale</l>
     <l n="23">Flashed o'er the deep — of a distant blood-red dawn</l>
     <l n="24">O'er San Domingo , where the embattled troops</l>
     <l n="25">Of Spain and Drake were met — but not in war —</l>
     <l n="26">Met in the dawn , by his compelling will ,</l>
     <l n="27">To offer up a sacrifice . Yea , there</l>
     <l n="28">Between the hosts , the hands of Spain herself</l>
     <l n="29">Slaughtered the Spanish murderers of the boy</l>
     <l n="30">Who had borne Drake 's flag of truce ; offered them up</l>
     <l n="31">As a blood-offering and an expiation</l>
     <l n="32">Lest Drake , with that dread alchemy of his soul ,</l>
     <l n="33">Should e'en transmute the dust beneath their feet</l>
     <l n="34">To one same substance with the place of pain</l>
     <l n="35">And whelm them suddenly in the eternal fires .</l>
     <l n="36">Rumour on rumour rushed across the sea ,</l>
     <l n="37">Large mockeries , and one most bitter of all ,</l>
     <l n="38">Wormwood to Philip , of how Drake had stood</l>
     <l n="39">I ’ the governor 's house at San Domingo , and seen</l>
     <l n="40">A mighty scutcheon of the King of Spain</l>
     <l n="41">Whereon was painted the terrestrial globe ,</l>
     <l n="42">And on the globe a mighty steed in act</l>
     <l n="43">To spring into the heavens , and from its mouth</l>
     <l n="44">Streaming like smoke a scroll , and on the scroll</l>
     <l n="45">Three words of flame and fury — Non sufficit</l>
     <l n="46">Orbis — of how Drake and his seamen stood</l>
     <l n="47">Gazing upon it , and could not forbear</l>
     <l n="48">From summoning the Spaniards to expound</l>
     <l n="49">Its meaning , whereupon a hurricane roar</l>
     <l n="50">Of mirth burst from those bearded British lips ,</l>
     <l n="51">And that immortal laughter shook the world .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="52">So , while the imperial warrior eyes of Spain</l>
     <l n="53">Watched , every hour , her vast Armada grow</l>
     <l n="54">Readier to launch and shatter with one stroke</l>
     <l n="55">Our island 's frail defence , fear gripped her still ,</l>
     <l n="56">For there came sounds across the heaving sea</l>
     <l n="57">Of secret springs unsealed , forces unchained ,</l>
     <l n="58">A mustering of deep elemental powers ,</l>
     <l n="59">A sound as of the burgeoning of boughs</l>
     <l n="60">In universal April and dead hearts</l>
     <l n="61">Uprising from their tombs ; a mighty cry</l>
     <l n="62">Of resurrection , surging through the souls</l>
     <l n="63">Of all mankind . For now the last wild tale</l>
     <l n="64">Swept like another dawn across the deep ;</l>
     <l n="65">And , in that dawn , men saw the slaves of Spain ,</l>
     <l n="66">The mutilated negroes of the mines ,</l>
     <l n="67">With gaunt backs wealed and branded , scarred and seared</l>
     <l n="68">By whip and iron , in Spain 's brute lust for gold ,</l>
     <l n="69">Saw them , at Drake 's great liberating word ,</l>
     <l n="70">Burst from their chains , erect , uplifting hands</l>
     <l n="71">Of rapture to the glad new light that then ,</l>
     <l n="72">Then first , began to struggle thro ’ the clouds</l>
     <l n="73">And crown all manhood with a sacred crown</l>
     <l n="74">August — a light which , though from age to age</l>
     <l n="75">Clouds may obscure it , grows and still shall grow ,</l>
     <l n="76">Until that Kingdom come , that grand Communion ,</l>
     <l n="77">That Commonweal , that Empire , which still draws</l>
     <l n="78">Nigher with every hour , that Federation ,</l>
     <l n="79">That turning of the wasteful strength of war</l>
     <l n="80">To accomplish large and fruitful tasks of peace ,</l>
     <l n="81">That gathering up of one another 's loads</l>
     <l n="82">Whereby the weak are strengthened and the strong</l>
     <l n="83">Made stronger in the increasing good of all .</l>
     <l n="84">Then , suddenly , it seemed , as he had gone ,</l>
     <l n="85">A ship came stealing into Plymouth Sound</l>
     <l n="86">And Drake was home again , but not to rest ;</l>
     <l n="87">For scarce had he cast anchor ere the road</l>
     <l n="88">To London rang beneath the flying hoofs</l>
     <l n="89">That bore his brief despatch to Burleigh , saying —</l>
     <l n="90">“ We have missed the Plate Fleet by but twelve hours ’ sail ,</l>
     <l n="91">The reason being best known to God . No less</l>
     <l n="92">We have given a cooling to the King of Spain .</l>
     <l n="93">There is a great gap opened which , methinks ,</l>

     <l n="110">This terse despatch the hunchback Burleigh read</l>

     <l n="114">And thrice , as a glorious lightning running along</l>
     <l n="115">And flashing between those simple words , he saw</l>
     <l n="116">The great new power that lay at England 's hand ,</l>
     <l n="117">An ocean-sovereignty , a power unknown</l>

     <l n="128">To leap at England 's throat ! Thrice he assayed</l>
     <l n="129">To think of England 's helplessness , her ships</l>
     <l n="130">Little and few . Thrice he assayed to quench</l>
     <l n="131">With caution the high furnace of his soul</l>
     <l n="132">Which Drake had kindled . As he read the last</l>
     <l n="133">Rough simple plea , I wait my Queen 's commands ,</l>
     <l n="134">His deep eyes flashed with glorious tears .</l>
     <l n="135">He leapt</l>
     <l n="136">To his feet and cried aloud , “ Before my God ,</l>
     <l n="137">I am proud , I am very proud for England 's sake !</l>
     <l n="138">This Drake is a terrible man to the King of Spain . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="139">And still , still , Gloriana , brooding darkly</l>
     <l n="140">On Mary of Scotland 's doom , who now at last</l>
     <l n="141">Was plucked from out her bosom like a snake</l>
     <l n="142">Hissing of war with France , a queenly snake ,</l>
     <l n="143">A Lilith in whose lovely gleaming folds</l>
     <l n="144">And sexual bonds the judgment of mankind</l>
     <l n="145">Writhes even yet half-strangled , meting out</l>
     <l n="146">Wild execrations on the maiden Queen</l>
     <l n="147">Who quenched those jewelled eyes and mixt with dust</l>
     <l n="148">That white and crimson , who with cold sharp steel</l>
     <l n="149">In substance and in spirit , severed the neck</l>
     <l n="150">And straightened out those glittering supple coils</l>
     <l n="151">For ever ; though for evermore will men</l>
     <l n="152">Lie subject to the unforgotten gleam</l>
     <l n="153">Of diamond eyes and cruel crimson mouth ,</l>

     <l n="155">Like lightning far through Europe and the world</l>
     <l n="156">For England , when amid the embattled fury</l>
     <l n="157">Of world-wide empires , England stood alone .</l>
     <l n="158">Still she held back from war , still disavowed</l>
     <l n="159">The deeds of Drake to Spain ; and yet once more</l>
     <l n="160">Philip , resolved at last never to swerve</l>
     <l n="161">By one digressive stroke , one ell or inch</l>
     <l n="162">From his own patient , sure , laborious path ,</l>
     <l n="163">Accepted her suave plea , and with all speed</l>
     <l n="164">Pressed on his huge emprise until it seemed</l>
     <l n="165">His coasts groaned with grim bulks of cannonry ,</l>
     <l n="166">Thick loaded hulks of thunder and towers of doom ;</l>
     <l n="167">And , all round Antwerp , Parma still prepared</l>
     <l n="168">To hurl such armies o'er the rolling sea</l>
     <l n="169">As in all history hardly the earth herself</l>
     <l n="170">Felt shake with terror her own green hills and plains .</l>
     <l n="171">I wait my Queen 's commands ! Despite the plea</l>
     <l n="172">Urged every hour upon her with the fire</l>
     <l n="173">That burned for action in the soul of Drake ,</l>
     <l n="174">Still she delayed , till on one darkling eve</l>
     <l n="175">She gave him audience in that glimmering room</l>
     <l n="176">Where first he saw her . Strangely sounded there</l>
     <l n="177">The seaman 's rough strong passion as he poured</l>
     <l n="178">His heart before her , pleading — “ Every hour</l>
     <l n="179">Is one more victory lost , ” and only heard</l>
     <l n="180">The bitter answer — “ Nay , but every hour</l>
     <l n="181">Is a breath snatched from the unconquerable</l>
     <l n="182">Doom , that awaits us if we are forced to war .</l>
     <l n="183">Yea , and who knows ?— though Spain may forge a sword ,</l>
     <l n="184">Its point is not inevitably bared</l>
     <l n="185">Against the breast of England ! ” As she spake ,</l>
     <l n="186">The winds without clamoured with clash of bells ,</l>
     <l n="187">There was a gleam of torches and a roar —</l>
     <l n="188">Mary , the traitress of the North , is dead ,</l>
     <l n="189">God save the Queen !</l>
     <l n="190">Her head bent down : she wept .</l>
     <l n="191">“ Pity me , friend , though I be queen , O yet</l>
     <l n="192">My heart is woman , and I am sore pressed</l>
     <l n="193">On every side ,— Scotland and France and Spain</l>
     <l n="194">Beset me , and I know not where to turn . ”</l>
     <l n="195">Even as she spake , there came a hurried step</l>
     <l n="196">Into that dim rich chamber . Walsingham</l>
     <l n="197">Stood there , before her , without ceremony</l>
     <l n="198">Thrusting a letter forth : “ At last , ” he cried ,</l>

     <l n="244">Of torches once again , and as they stood</l>
     <l n="245">Silently listening , all the winds ran wild</l>
     <l n="246">With clamouring bells , and a great cry went up —</l>

     <l n="248">“ I 'll vouch for some two hundred Catholic throats</l>

     <l n="262">She ceased ; and Drake , in a strange voice , hoarse and low ,</l>
     <l n="263">Trembling with passion deeper than all speech ,</l>
     <l n="264">Cried out — “ No more than the great ocean-sea</l>
     <l n="265">Which makes the enemies ’ coast our frontier now ;</l>
     <l n="266">No more than that great Empire of the deep</l>

     <l n="278">Ay , on the sacred seas we ne'er shall know</l>
     <l n="279">They hoist their sails this day by peaceful quays ,</l>
     <l n="280">Great gleaming wharves in the perfect City of God ,</l>
     <l n="281">If she but claim her heritage . ”</l>
     <l n="282">He ceased ;</l>
     <l n="283">And the deep dream of that new realm the sea ,</l>
     <l n="284">Through all the soul of Gloriana surged ,</l>
     <l n="285">A moment , then with splendid eyes that filled</l>
     <l n="286">With fire of sunsets far away , she cried</l>
     <l n="287">( Faith making her a child , yet queenlier still )</l>
     <l n="288">“ Yea , claim it thou for me ! ”</l>
     <l n="289">A moment there</l>
     <l n="290">Trembling she stood . Then , once again , there passed</l>
     <l n="291">A rush of torches through the gloom without ,</l>

     <l n="294">“ Yea go , then , go , ”</l>
     <l n="295">She said , “ God speed you now , Sir Francis Drake ,</l>

     <l n="298">Without a word</l>
     <l n="299">Drake bent above her hand and , ere she knew it ,</l>
     <l n="300">His eyes from the dark doorway flashed farewell</l>
     <l n="301">And he was gone . But ere he leapt to saddle</l>
     <l n="302">Walsingham stood at his stirrup , muttering “ Ride ,</l>
     <l n="303">Ride now like hell to Plymouth ; for the Queen</l>
     <l n="304">Is hard beset , and ere ye are out at sea</l>
     <l n="305">Her mood will change . The friends of Spain will move</l>
     <l n="306">Earth and the heavens for your recall . They 'll tempt her</l>
     <l n="307">With their false baits of peace , though I shall stand</l>
     <l n="308">Here at your back through thick and thin ; farewell ! ”</l>
     <l n="309">Fire flashed beneath the hoofs and Drake was gone .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="310">Scarce had he vanished in the night than doubt</l>

     <l n="313">And Burleigh himself , prime mover of that death ,</l>
     <l n="314">Being held in much disfavour for it , stood</l>
     <l n="315">As helpless . Long ere Drake or human power ,</l>
     <l n="316">They thought , could put to sea , a courier sped</l>
     <l n="317">To Plymouth bidding Drake forbear to strike</l>
     <l n="318">At Spain , but keep to the high seas , and lo ,</l>
     <l n="319">The roadstead glittered empty . Drake was gone !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="320">Gone ! Though the friends of Spain had poured their gold</l>
     <l n="321">To thin his ranks , and every hour his crews</l>
     <l n="322">Deserted , he had laughed — “ Let Spain buy scum !</l>
     <l n="323">Next to an honest seaman I love best</l>
     <l n="324">An honest landsman . What more goodly task</l>
     <l n="325">Than teaching brave men seamanship ? ” He had filled</l>
     <l n="326">His ships with soldiers ! Out in the teeth of the gale</l>
     <l n="327">That raged against him he had driven . In vain ,</l>
     <l n="328">Amid the boisterous laughter of the quays ,</l>
     <l n="329">A pinnace dashed in hot pursuit and met</l>
     <l n="330">A roaring breaker and came hurtling back</l>
     <l n="331">With oars and spars all trailing in the foam ,</l>
     <l n="332">A tangled mass of wreckage and despair .</l>
     <l n="333">Sky swept to stormy sky : no sail could live</l>
     <l n="334">In that great yeast of waves ; but Drake was gone !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="335">Then , once again , across the rolling sea</l>
     <l n="336">Great rumours rushed of how he had sacked the port</l>
     <l n="337">Of Cadiz and had swept along the coast</l>
     <l n="338">To Lisbon , where the whole Armada lay .</l>
     <l n="339">Had snapped up prizes under its very nose ,</l>
     <l n="340">And taunted Santa Cruz , High Admiral</l>
     <l n="341">Of Spain , striving to draw him out for fight ,</l>
     <l n="342">And offering , if his course should lie that way ,</l>
     <l n="343">To convoy him to Britain , taunted him</l>
     <l n="344">So bitterly that for once , in the world 's eyes ,</l>
     <l n="345">A jest had power to kill ; for Santa Cruz</l>
     <l n="346">Died with the spleen of it , since he could not move</l>
     <l n="347">Before the appointed season . Then there came</l>
     <l n="348">Flying back home , the Queen 's old Admiral</l>
     <l n="349">Borough , deserting Drake and all aghast</l>
     <l n="350">At Drake 's temerity : “ For , ” he said , “ this man ,</l>
     <l n="351">Thrust o'er my head , against all precedent ,</l>
     <l n="352">Bade me follow him into harbour mouths</l>
     <l n="353">A-flame with cannon like the jaws of death ,</l>
     <l n="354">Whereat I much demurred ; and straightway Drake</l>
     <l n="355">Clapped me in irons , me — an officer</l>
     <l n="356">And Admiral of the Queen ; and , though my voice</l>
     <l n="357">Was all against it , plunged into the pit</l>
     <l n="358">Without me , left me with some word that burns</l>
     <l n="359">And rankles in me still , making me fear</l>
     <l n="360">The man was mad , some word of lonely seas ,</l>
     <l n="361">A desert island and a mutineer</l>
     <l n="362">And dead Magellan 's gallows . Sirs , my life</l>
     <l n="363">Was hardly safe with him . Why , he resolved</l>
     <l n="364">To storm the Castle of St. Vincent , sirs ,</l>
     <l n="365">A castle on a cliff , grinning with guns ,</l>
     <l n="366">Well known impregnable ! The Spaniards fear</l>
     <l n="367">Drake ; but to see him land below it and bid</l>
     <l n="368">Surrender , sirs , the strongest fort of Spain</l>
     <l n="369">Without a blow , they laughed ! And straightway he ,</l>
     <l n="370">With all the fury of Satan , turned that cliff</l>
     <l n="371">To hell itself . He sent down to the ships</l>
     <l n="372">For faggots , broken oars , beams , bowsprits , masts ,</l>
     <l n="373">And piled them up against the outer gates ,</l>
     <l n="374">Higher and higher , and fired them . There he stood</l>
     <l n="375">Amid the smoke and flame and cannon-shot ,</l>
     <l n="376">This Admiral , like a common seamen , black</l>
     <l n="377">With soot , besmeared with blood , his naked arms</l>
     <l n="378">Full of great faggots , labouring like a giant</l>
     <l n="379">And roaring like Apollyon . Sirs , he is mad !</l>
     <l n="380">But did he take it , say you ? Yea , he took it ,</l>
     <l n="381">The mightiest stronghold on the coast of Spain ,</l>
     <l n="382">Took it and tumbled all its big brass guns</l>
     <l n="383">Clattering over the cliffs into the sea .</l>
     <l n="384">But , sirs , ye need not raise a cheer so loud</l>
     <l n="385">It is not warfare . ‘ Twas a madman 's trick ,</l>
     <l n="386">A devil 's ! ”</l>
     <l n="387">Then the rumour of a storm</l>
     <l n="388">That scattered the fleet of Drake to the four winds</l>
     <l n="389">Disturbed the heart of England , as his ships</l>
     <l n="390">Came straggling into harbour , one by one ,</l>
     <l n="391">Saying they could not find him . Then , at last ,</l>
     <l n="392">When the storm burst in its earth-shaking might</l>
     <l n="393">Along our coasts , one night of rolling gloom</l>
     <l n="394">His cannon woke old Plymouth . In he came</l>
     <l n="395">Across the thunder and lightning of the sea</l>
     <l n="396">With his grim ship of war and , close behind ,</l>
     <l n="397">A shadow like a mountain or a cloud</l>
     <l n="398">Torn from the heaven-high panoplies of Spain ,</l>
     <l n="399">A captured galleon loomed , and round her prow</l>
     <l n="400">A blazoned scroll , whence ( as she neared the quays</l>
     <l n="401">Which many a lanthorn swung from brawny fist</l>
     <l n="402">Yellowed ) the sudden crimson of her name</l>
     <l n="403">San Filippe flashed o'er the white sea of faces ,</l>
     <l n="404">And a rending shout went skyward that outroared</l>
     <l n="405">The blanching breakers — “ ‘ Tis the heart of Spain !</l>
     <l n="406">The great San Filippe ! ” Overhead she towered ,</l>
     <l n="407">The mightiest ship afloat ; and in her hold</l>
     <l n="408">The riches of a continent , a prize</l>
     <l n="409">Greater than earth had ever known ; for there</l>
     <l n="410">Not only ruby and pearl like ocean-beaches</l>
     <l n="411">Heaped on some wizard coast in that dim hull</l>
     <l n="412">Blazed to the lanthorn-light ; not only gold</l>
     <l n="413">Gleamed , though of gold a million would not buy</l>
     <l n="414">Her store ; but in her cabin lay the charts</l>
     <l n="415">And secrets of the wild unwhispered wealth</l>
     <l n="416">Of India , secrets that splashed London wharves</l>
     <l n="417">With coloured dreams and made her misty streets</l>
     <l n="418">Flame like an Eastern City when the sun</l>
     <l n="419">Shatters itself on jewelled domes and spills</l>
     <l n="420">Its crimson wreckage thro ’ the silvery palms .</l>
     <l n="421">And of those dreams the far East India quest</l>
     <l n="422">Began : the first foundation-stone was laid</l>
     <l n="423">Of our great Indian Empire , and a star</l>
     <l n="424">Began to tremble on the brows of England</l>
     <l n="425">That time can never darken .</l>
     <l n="426">But now the seas</l>
     <l n="427">Darkened indeed with menace ; now at last</l>
     <l n="428">The cold wind of the black approaching wings</l>
     <l n="429">Of Azrael crept across the deep : the storm</l>
     <l n="430">Throbbed with their thunderous pulse , and ere that moon</l>
     <l n="431">Waned , a swift gunboat foamed into the Sound</l>
     <l n="432">With word that all the Invincible Armada</l>
     <l n="433">Was hoisting sail for England .</l>
     <l n="434">Even now ,</l>
     <l n="435">Elizabeth , torn a thousand ways , withheld</l>
     <l n="436">The word for which Drake pleaded as for life ,</l>
     <l n="437">That he might meet them ere they left their coasts ,</l>
     <l n="438">Meet them or ever they reached the Channel , meet them</l>
     <l n="439">Now , or — “ Too late ! Too late ! ” At last his voice</l>
     <l n="440">Beat down e'en those that blindly dinned her ears</l>
     <l n="441">With chatter of meeting Spain on British soil ;</l>
     <l n="442">And swiftly she commanded ( seeing once more</l>
     <l n="443">The light that burned amid the approaching gloom</l>
     <l n="444">In Drake 's deep eyes ) Lord Howard of Effingham ,</l>
     <l n="445">High Admiral of England , straight to join him</l>
     <l n="446">At Plymouth Sound . “ How many ships are wanted ? ”</l>
     <l n="447">She asked him , thinking “ we are few , indeed ! ”</l>
     <l n="448">“ Give me but sixteen merchantmen , ” he said ,</l>
     <l n="449">“ And but four battleships , by the mercy of God ,</l>
     <l n="450">I 'll answer for the Armada ! ” Out to sea</l>
     <l n="451">They swept , in the teeth of a gale ; but vainly Drake</l>
     <l n="452">Strove to impart the thought wherewith his mind</l>
     <l n="453">Travailed — to win command of the ocean-sea</l>
     <l n="454">By bursting on the fleets of Spain at once</l>
     <l n="455">Even as they left their ports , not as of old</l>
     <l n="456">To hover in a vain dream of defence</l>
     <l n="457">Round fifty threatened points of British coast ,</l>
     <l n="458">But Howard , clinging to his old-world order ,</l>
     <l n="459">Flung out his ships in a loose , long , straggling line</l>
     <l n="460">Across the Channel , waiting , wary , alert ,</l>
     <l n="461">But powerless thus as a string of scattered sea-gulls</l>
     <l n="462">Beating against the storm . Then , flying to meet them ,</l>
     <l n="463">A merchantman brought terror down the wind ,</l>
     <l n="464">With news that she had seen that monstrous host</l>
     <l n="465">Stretching from sky to sky , great hulks of doom ,</l>
     <l n="466">Dragging death 's midnight with them o'er the sea</l>
     <l n="467">Tow'rds England . Up to Howard 's flag-ship Drake</l>
     <l n="468">In his immortal battle-ship — Revenge ,</l>
     <l n="469">Rushed thro ’ the foam , and thro ’ the swirling seas</l>
     <l n="470">His pinnace dashed alongside . On to the decks</l>
     <l n="471">O ’ the tossing flag-ship , like a very Viking</l>
     <l n="472">Shaking the surf and rainbows of the spray</l>
     <l n="473">From sun-smit lion-like mane and beard he stood</l>
     <l n="474">Before Lord Howard in the escutcheoned poop</l>
     <l n="475">And poured his heart out like the rending sea</l>
     <l n="476">In passionate wave on wave :</l>
     <l n="477">“ If yonder fleet</l>
     <l n="478">Once reach the Channel , hardly the mercy of God</l>
     <l n="479">Saves England ! I would pray with my last breath ,</l>
     <l n="480">Let us beat up to windward of them now ,</l>
     <l n="481">And handle them before they reach the Channel . ”</l>
     <l n="482">“ Nay ; but we cannot bare the coast , ” cried Howard ,</l>
     <l n="483">“ Nor have we stores of powder or food enough ! ”</l>
     <l n="484">“ My lord , ” said Drake , with his great arm outstretched ,</l>
     <l n="485">“ There is food enough in yonder enemy 's ships ,</l>
     <l n="486">And powder enough and cannon-shot enough !</l>
     <l n="487">We must re-victual there . Look ! look ! ” he cried ,</l>
     <l n="488">And pointed to the heavens . As for a soul</l>
     <l n="489">That by sheer force of will compels the world</l>
     <l n="490">To work his bidding , so it seemed the wind</l>
     <l n="491">That blew against them slowly veered . The sails</l>
     <l n="492">Quivered , the skies revolved . A northerly breeze</l>
     <l n="493">Awoke and now , behind the British ships ,</l>
     <l n="494">Blew steadily tow'rds the unseen host of Spain .</l>
     <l n="495">“ It is the breath of God , ” cried Drake ; “ they lie</l>
     <l n="496">Wind-bound , and we may work our will with them .</l>
     <l n="497">Signal the word , Lord Howard , and drive down ! ”</l>
     <l n="498">And as a man convinced by heaven itself</l>
     <l n="499">Lord Howard ordered , straightway , the whole fleet</l>
     <l n="500">To advance .</l>
     <l n="501">And now , indeed , as Drake foresaw ,</l>
     <l n="502">The Armada lay , beyond the dim horizon ,</l>
     <l n="503">Wind-bound and helpless in Corunna bay ,</l>
     <l n="504">At England 's mercy , could her fleet but draw</l>
     <l n="505">Nigh enough , with its fire-ships and great guns</l>
     <l n="506">To windward . Nearer , nearer , league by league</l>
     <l n="507">The ships of England came : till Ushant lay</l>
     <l n="508">Some seventy leagues behind . Then , yet once more</l>
     <l n="509">The wind veered , straight against them . To remain</l>
     <l n="510">Beating against it idly was to starve :</l>
     <l n="511">And , as a man whose power upon the world</l>
     <l n="512">Fails for one moment of exhausted will ,</l>
     <l n="513">Drake , gathering up his forces as he went</l>
     <l n="514">For one more supreme effort , turned his ship</l>
     <l n="515">Tow'rds Plymouth , and retreated with the rest .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="516">There , while the ships refitted with all haste</l>
     <l n="517">And axe and hammer rang , one golden eve</l>
     <l n="518">Just as the setting sun began to fringe</l>
     <l n="519">The clouds with crimson , and the creaming waves</l>
     <l n="520">Were one wild riot of fairy rainbows , Drake</l>
     <l n="521">Stood with old comrades on the close-cropped green</l>
     <l n="522">Of Plymouth Hoe , playing a game of bowls .</l>
     <l n="523">Far off unseen , a little barque , full-sail ,</l>
     <l n="524">Struggled and leapt and strove tow'rds Plymouth Sound ,</l>
     <l n="525">Noteless as any speckled herring-gull</l>
     <l n="526">Flickering between the white flakes of the waves .</l>
     <l n="527">A group of schoolboys with their satchels lay</l>
     <l n="528">Stretched on the green , gazing with great wide eyes</l>
     <l n="529">Upon their seamen heroes , as like gods</l>
     <l n="530">Disporting with the battles of the world</l>
     <l n="531">They loomed , tossing black bowls like cannon-balls</l>
     <l n="532">Against the rosy West , or lounged at ease</l>
     <l n="533">With faces olive-dark against that sky</l>
     <l n="534">Laughing , while from the neighboring inn mine host ,</l>
     <l n="535">White aproned and blue-jerkined , hurried out</l>
     <l n="536">With foaming cups of sack , and they drank deep ,</l>
     <l n="537">Tossing their heads back under the golden clouds</l>
     <l n="538">And burying their bearded lips . The hues</l>
     <l n="539">That slashed their doublets , for the boy 's bright eyes</l>
     <l n="540">( Even as the gleams of Grecian cloud or moon</l>
     <l n="541">Revealed the old gods ) were here rich dusky streaks</l>
     <l n="542">Of splendour from the Spanish Main , that shone</l>
     <l n="543">But to proclaim these heroes . There a boy</l>
     <l n="544">More bold crept nearer to a slouched hat thrown</l>
     <l n="545">Upon the green , and touched the silver plume ,</l>
     <l n="546">And felt as if he had touched a sunset-isle</l>
     <l n="547">Of feathery palms beyond a crimson sea .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="548">Another stared at the blue rings of smoke</l>
     <l n="549">A storm-scarred seaman puffed from a long pipe</l>
     <l n="550">Primed with the strange new herb they had lately found</l>
     <l n="551">In far Virginia . But the little ship</l>
     <l n="552">Now plunging into Plymouth Bay none saw .</l>
     <l n="553">E'en when she had anchored and her straining boat</l>
     <l n="554">Had touched the land , and the boat 's crew over the quays</l>
     <l n="555">Leapt with a shout , scarce was there one to heed .</l>
     <l n="556">A seaman , smiling , swaggered out of the inn</l>
     <l n="557">Swinging in one brown hand a gleaming cage</l>
     <l n="558">Wherein a big green parrot chattered and clung</l>
     <l n="559">Fluttering against the wires . A troop of girls</l>
     <l n="560">With arms linked paused to watch the game of bowls ;</l>
     <l n="561">And now they flocked around the cage , while one</l>
     <l n="562">With rosy finger tempted the horny beak</l>
     <l n="563">To bite . Close overhead a sea-mew flashed</l>
     <l n="564">Seaward . Once , from an open window , soft</l>
     <l n="565">Through trellised leaves , not far away , a voice</l>
     <l n="566">Floated , a voice that flushed the cheek of Drake ,</l>
     <l n="567">The voice of Bess , bending her glossy head</l>
     <l n="568">Over the broidery frame , in a quiet song .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="569">The song ceased . Still , with rainbows in their eyes ,</l>
     <l n="570">The schoolboys watched the bowls like cannon-balls</l>
     <l n="571">Roll from the hand of gods along the turf .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="572">Suddenly , tow'rds the green , a little cloud</l>
     <l n="573">Of seamen , shouting , stumbling , as they ran</l>
     <l n="574">Drew all eyes on them . The game ceased . A voice</l>
     <l n="575">Rough with the storms of many an ocean roared</l>
     <l n="576">“ Drake ! Cap'en Drake ! The Armada !</l>
     <l n="577">They are in the Channel ! We sighted them —</l>
     <l n="578">A line of battleships ! We could not see</l>
     <l n="579">An end of them . They stretch from north to south</l>
     <l n="580">Like a great storm of clouds , glinting with guns ,</l>
     <l n="581">From sky to sky ! ”</l>
     <l n="582">So , after all his strife ,</l>
     <l n="583">The wasted weeks had tripped him , the fierce hours</l>
     <l n="584">Of pleading for the sea 's command , great hours</l>
     <l n="585">And golden moments , all were lost . The fleet</l>
     <l n="586">Of Spain had won the Channel without a blow .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="587">All eyes were turned on Drake , as he stood there</l>
     <l n="588">A giant against the sunset and the sea</l>
     <l n="589">Looming , alone . Far off , the first white star</l>
     <l n="590">Gleamed in a rosy space of heaven . He tossed</l>
     <l n="591">A grim black ball i ’ the lustrous air and laughed ,—</l>
     <l n="592">“ Come lads , ” he said , “ we 've time to finish the game . ”</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Few minutes , and well wasted those , were spent</l>
     <l n="2">On that great game of bowls ; for well knew Drake</l>
     <l n="3">What panic threatened Plymouth , since his fleet</l>
     <l n="4">Lay trapped there by the black head-wind that blew</l>
     <l n="5">Straight up the Sound , and Plymouth town itself ,</l>
     <l n="6">Except the ships won seaward ere the dawn ,</l>
     <l n="7">Lay at the Armada 's mercy . Never a seaman</l>
     <l n="8">Of all the sea-dogs clustered on the quays ,</l>
     <l n="9">And all the captains clamouring round Lord Howard ,</l>
     <l n="10">Hoped that one ship might win to the open sea :</l>
     <l n="11">At dawn , they thought , the Armada 's rolling guns</l>
     <l n="12">To windward , in an hour , must shatter them ,</l>
     <l n="13">Huddled in their red slaughter-house like sheep .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="14">Now was the great sun sunken and the night</l>
     <l n="15">Dark . Far to Westward , like the soul of man</l>
     <l n="16">Fighting blind nature , a wild flare of red</l>
     <l n="17">Upon some windy headland suddenly leapt</l>
     <l n="18">And vanished flickering into the clouds . Again</l>
     <l n="19">It leapt and vanished : then all at once it streamed</l>
     <l n="20">Steadily as a crimson torch upheld</l>
     <l n="21">By Titan hands to heaven . It was the first</l>
     <l n="22">Beacon ! A sudden silence swept along</l>
     <l n="23">The seething quays , and in their midst appeared</l>
     <l n="24">Drake .</l>
     <l n="25">Then the jubilant thunder of his voice</l>
     <l n="26">Rolled , buffeting the sea-wind far and nigh ,</l>
     <l n="27">And ere they knew what power as of a sea</l>
     <l n="28">Surged through them , his immortal battle-ship</l>
     <l n="29">Revenge had flung out cables to the quays ,</l>
     <l n="30">And while the seamen , as he had commanded ,</l>
     <l n="31">Knotted thick ropes together , he stood apart</l>
     <l n="32">( For well he knew what panic threatened still )</l>
     <l n="33">Whittling idly at a scrap of wood ,</l>
     <l n="34">And carved a little boat out for the child</l>
     <l n="35">Of some old sea-companion .</l>
     <l n="36">So great and calm a master of the world</l>
     <l n="37">Seemed Drake that , as he whittled , and the chips</l>
     <l n="38">Fluttered into the blackness over the quay ,</l>
     <l n="39">Men said that in this hour of England 's need</l>
     <l n="40">Each tiny flake turned to a battle-ship ;</l>
     <l n="41">For now began the lanthorns , one by one ,</l>
     <l n="42">To glitter , and half-reveal the shadowy hulks</l>
     <l n="43">Before him .— So the huge old legend grew ,</l>
     <l n="44">Not all unworthy the Homeric age</l>
     <l n="45">Of gods and god-like men .</l>
     <l n="46">St. Michael 's Mount ,</l>
     <l n="47">Answering the first wild beacon far away ,</l>
     <l n="48">Rolled crimson thunders to the stormy sky !</l>
     <l n="49">The ropes were knotted . Through the panting dark</l>
     <l n="50">Great heaving lines of seamen all together</l>
     <l n="51">Hauled with a shout , and all together again</l>
     <l n="52">Hauled with a shout against the roaring wind ;</l>
     <l n="53">And slowly , slowly , onward tow'rds the sea</l>
     <l n="54">Moved the Revenge , and seaward ever heaved</l>
     <l n="55">The brawny backs together , and in their midst ,</l>
     <l n="56">Suddenly , as they slackened , Drake was there</l>
     <l n="57">Hauling like any ten , and with his heart</l>
     <l n="58">Doubling the strength of all , giving them joy</l>
     <l n="59">Of battle against those odds ,— ay , till they found</l>
     <l n="60">Delight in the burning tingle of the blood</l>
     <l n="61">That even their hardy hands must feel besmear</l>
     <l n="62">The harsh , rough , straining ropes . There as they toiled ,</l>
     <l n="63">Answering a score of hills , old Beachy Head</l>
     <l n="64">Streamed like a furnace to the rolling clouds</l>
     <l n="65">Then all around the coast each windy ness</l>
     <l n="66">And craggy mountain kindled . Peak from peak</l>
     <l n="67">Caught the tremendous fire , and passed it on</l>
     <l n="68">Round the bluff East and the black mouth of Thames ,—</l>
     <l n="69">Up , northward to the waste wild Yorkshire fells</l>
     <l n="70">And gloomy Cumberland , where , like a giant ,</l>
     <l n="71">Great Skiddaw grasped the red tempestuous brand ,</l>
     <l n="72">And thrust it up against the reeling heavens .</l>
     <l n="73">Then all night long , inland , the wandering winds</l>
     <l n="74">Ran wild with clamour and clash of startled bells ;</l>
     <l n="75">All night the cities seethed with torches , flashed</l>
     <l n="76">With twenty thousand flames of burnished steel ;</l>
     <l n="77">While over the trample and thunder of hooves blazed forth</l>
     <l n="78">The lightning of wild trumpets . Lonely lanes</l>
     <l n="79">Of country darkness , lit by cottage doors</l>
     <l n="80">Entwined with rose and honeysuckle , roared</l>
     <l n="81">Like mountain-torrents now — East , West , and South ,</l>
     <l n="82">As to the coasts with pike and musket streamed</l>
     <l n="83">The trained bands , horse and foot , from every town</l>
     <l n="84">And every hamlet . All the shaggy hills</l>
     <l n="85">From Milford Haven to the Downs of Kent ,</l>
     <l n="86">And up to Humber , gleamed with many a hedge</l>
     <l n="87">Of pikes between the beacon 's crimson glares ;</l>
     <l n="88">While in red London forty thousand men ,</l>
     <l n="89">In case the Invader should prevail , drew swords</l>
     <l n="90">Around their Queen . All night in dark St. Paul 's ,</l>
     <l n="91">While round it rolled a multitudinous roar</l>
     <l n="92">As of the Atlantic on a Western beach ,</l>
     <l n="93">And all the leaning London streets were lit</l>
     <l n="94">With fury of torches , rose the passionate prayer</l>
     <l n="95">Of England 's peril :</l>
     <l n="96">O Lord God of Hosts ,</l>
     <l n="97">Let Thine enemies know that Thou hast taken</l>
     <l n="98">England into Thine hands !</l>
     <l n="99">The mighty sound</l>
     <l n="100">Rolled , billowing round the kneeling aisles , then died ,</l>
     <l n="101">Echoing up the heights . A voice , far off ,</l>
     <l n="102">As on the cross of Calvary , caught it up</l>
     <l n="103">And poured the prayer o'er that deep hush , alone :</l>
     <l n="104">We beseech Thee , O God , to go before our armies ,</l>
     <l n="105">Bless and prosper them both by land and sea !</l>
     <l n="106">Grant unto them Thy victory , O God ,</l>
     <l n="107">As Thou usedst to do to Thy children when they please Thee !</l>
     <l n="108">All power , all strength , all victory come from Thee !</l>
     <l n="109">Then from the lips of all those thousands burst</l>
     <l n="110">A sound as from the rent heart of an ocean ,</l>
     <l n="111">One tumult , one great rushing storm of wings</l>
     <l n="112">Cleaving the darkness round the Gates of Heaven :</l>
     <l n="113">Some put their trust in chariots and some in horses ;</l>
     <l n="114">But we will remember Thy name , O Lord our God !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="115">So , while at Plymouth Sound her seamen toiled</l>
     <l n="116">All through the night , and scarce a ship had won</l>
     <l n="117">Seaward , the heart of England cried to God .</l>
     <l n="118">All night , while trumpets yelled and blared without ,</l>
     <l n="119">And signal cannon shook the blazoned panes ,</l>
     <l n="120">And billowing multitudes went thundering by ,</l>
     <l n="121">Amid that solemn pillared hush arose</l>
     <l n="122">From lips of kneeling thousands one great prayer</l>

     <l n="498">‘ Twere well to handle them again at once . ” A growl</l>

     <l n="505">Till we be reinforced . ”</l>
     <l n="506">“ My lord , ” said Drake ,</l>
     <l n="507">“ Had we that week to spare for which I prayed ,</l>
     <l n="508">And were we handling them in Spanish seas ,</l>
     <l n="509">We might delay . There is no choosing now .</l>
     <l n="510">Yon hulks of doom are steadfastly resolved</l>
     <l n="511">On one tremendous path and solid end —</l>
     <l n="512">To join their powers with Parma 's thirty thousand</l>
     <l n="513">( Not heeding our light horsemen of the sea ) ,</l>
     <l n="514">Then in one earthquake of o'erwhelming arms</l>

     <l n="516">The first poor thought which now and evermore</l>
     <l n="517">Must be the sceptre of Britain , the steel trident</l>
     <l n="518">Of ocean-sovereignty . That mighty fleet</l>
     <l n="519">Invincible , impregnable , omnipotent ,</l>
     <l n="520">Must here and now be shattered , never be joined</l>
     <l n="521">With Parma , never abase the wind-swept sea ,</l>
     <l n="522">With oaken roads for thundering legions</l>
     <l n="523">To trample in the splendour of the sun</l>
     <l n="524">From Europe to our island .</l>
     <l n="525">As for food ,</l>
     <l n="526">In yonder enemy 's fleet there is food enough</l>
     <l n="527">To feed a nation ; ay , and powder enough</l>
     <l n="528">To split an empire . I will answer for it</l>
     <l n="529">Ye shall not lack of either , nor for shot ,</l>
     <l n="530">Not though ye pluck them out of your own beams</l>
     <l n="531">To feed your hungry cannon . Cast your bread</l>
     <l n="532">Upon the waters . Think not of the Queen !</l>
     <l n="533">She will not send it ! For she hath not known</l>
     <l n="534">( How could she know ? ) this wide new realm of hers ,</l>
     <l n="535">When we ourselves — her seamen — scarce have learnt</l>
     <l n="536">What means this kingdom of the ocean-sea</l>
     <l n="537">To England and her throne — food , life-blood , life !</l>
     <l n="538">She could not understand who , when our ships</l>
     <l n="539">Put out from Plymouth , hardly gave them store</l>
     <l n="540">Of powder and shot to last three fighting days ,</l>
     <l n="541">Or rations even for those . Blame not the Queen ,</l>
     <l n="542">Who hath striven for England as no king hath fought</l>
     <l n="543">Since England was a nation . Bear with me ,</l>
     <l n="544">For I must pour my heart before you now</l>
     <l n="545">This one last time . Yon fishing-boats have brought</l>
     <l n="546">Tidings how on this very day she rode</l>
     <l n="547">Before her mustered pikes at Tilbury .</l>
     <l n="548">Methinks I see her riding down their lines</l>
     <l n="549">High on her milk-white Barbary charger , hear</l>
     <l n="550">Her voice — ‘ My people , though my flesh be woman ,</l>
     <l n="551">My heart is of your kingly lion 's breed :</l>
     <l n="552">I come myself to lead you ! ’ I see the sun</l>
     <l n="553">Shining upon her armour , hear the voice</l>
     <l n="554">Of all her armies roaring like one sea —</l>
     <l n="555">God save Elizabeth , our English Queen !</l>
     <l n="556">‘ God save her , ’ I say , too ; but still she dreams ,</l>
     <l n="557">As all too many of us — bear with me !— dream ,</l>
     <l n="558">Of Crécy , when our England 's war was thus ;</l>
     <l n="559">When we , too , hurled our hosts across the deep</l>
     <l n="560">As now Spain dreams to hurl them on our isle .</l>
     <l n="561">But now our war is otherwise . We claim</l>
     <l n="562">The sea 's command , and Spain shall never land</l>
     <l n="563">One swordsman on our island . Blame her not ,</l>
     <l n="564">But look not to the Queen . The people fight</l>
     <l n="565">This war of ours , not princes . In this hour</l>
     <l n="566">God maketh us a people . We have seen</l>
     <l n="567">Victories , never victory like to this ,</l>
     <l n="568">When in our England 's darkest hour of need</l>
     <l n="569">Her seamen , without wage , powder , or food ,</l>
     <l n="570">Are yet on fire to fight for her . Your ships</l>
     <l n="571">Tossing in the great sunset of an Empire ,</l>
     <l n="572">Dawn of a sovereign people , are all manned</l>
     <l n="573">By heroes , raggèd , hungry , who will die</l>
     <l n="574">Like flies ere long , because they have no food</l>
     <l n="575">But turns to fever-breeding carrion</l>
     <l n="576">Not fit for dogs . They are half-naked , hopeless</l>
     <l n="577">Living , of any reward ; and if they die</l>
     <l n="578">They die a dog 's death . We shall reap the fame</l>
     <l n="579">While they — great God ! and all this cannot quench</l>
     <l n="580">The glory in their eyes . They will be served</l>
     <l n="581">Six at the mess of four , eking it out</l>
     <l n="582">With what their own rude nets may catch by night ,</l>
     <l n="583">Silvering the guns and naked arms that haul</l>
     <l n="584">Under the stars with silver past all price ,</l>
     <l n="585">While some small ship-boy in the black crow 's nest</l>
     <l n="586">Watches across the waters for the foe .</l>
     <l n="587">My lord , it is a terrible thing for Spain</l>
     <l n="588">When poor men thus go out against her princes ;</l>
     <l n="589">For so God whispers ‘ Victory ’ in our ears ,</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="35">
     <l n="591">Once again</l>
     <l n="592">A growl of fierce approval answered him ,</l>
     <l n="593">And Hawkins cried — “ I stand by Francis Drake ” ;</l>
     <l n="594">But Howard , clinging to his old-world order ,</l>
     <l n="595">Yet with such manly strength as dared to rank</l>
     <l n="596">Drake 's wisdom of the sea above his own ,</l>
     <l n="597">Sturdily shook his head . “ I dare not risk</l>
     <l n="598">A close attack . Once grappled we are doomed .</l>
     <l n="599">We 'll follow on their trail no less , with Drake</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="36">
     <l n="603">Drake , still thinking in his heart ,—</l>
     <l n="604">“ And if Spain be not shattered here and now</l>
     <l n="605">We are doomed no less , ” must even rest content</l>
     <l n="606">With that good vantage .</l>
     <l n="607">As the sunset died</l>
     <l n="608">Over the darkling emerald seas that swelled</l>
     <l n="609">Before the freshening wind , the pinnaces dashed</l>
     <l n="610">To their own ships ; and into the mind of Drake</l>
     <l n="611">There stole a plot that twitched his lips to a smile .</l>
     <l n="612">High on the heaving purple of the poop</l>
     <l n="613">Under the glimmer of firm and full-blown sails</l>
     <l n="614">He stood , an iron statue , glancing back</l>
     <l n="615">Anon at his stern-cresset 's crimson flare ,</l>
     <l n="616">The star of all the shadowy ships that plunged</l>
     <l n="617">Like ghosts amid the grey stream of his wake ,</l>
     <l n="618">And all around him heard the low keen song</l>
     <l n="619">Of hidden ropes above the wail and creak</l>
     <l n="620">Of blocks and long low swish of cloven foam ,</l>
     <l n="621">A keen rope-music in the formless night ,</l>
     <l n="622">A harmony , a strong intent good sound ,</l>
     <l n="623">Well-strung and taut , singing the will of man .</l>
     <l n="624">“ Your oriflamme , ” he muttered ,— “ so you travail</l>
     <l n="625">With sea-speech in the tongue of old Poictiers —</l>
     <l n="626">Shall be my own stern-lanthorn . Watch it well ,</l>
     <l n="627">My good Lord Howard . ”</l>
     <l n="628">Over the surging seas</l>
     <l n="629">The little Revenge went swooping on the trail ,</l>
     <l n="630">Leading the ships of England . One by one</l>
     <l n="631">Out of the gloom before them slowly crept ,</l>
     <l n="632">Sinister gleam by gleam , like blood-red stars ,</l>
     <l n="633">The rearmost lanthorns of the Spanish Fleet ,</l>
     <l n="634">A shaggy purple sky of secret storm</l>
     <l n="635">Heaving from north to south upon the black</l>
     <l n="636">Breast of the waters . Once again with lips</l>
     <l n="637">Twitched to a smile , Drake suddenly bade them crowd</l>
     <l n="638">All sail upon the little Revenge . She leapt</l>
     <l n="639">Forward . Smiling he watched the widening gap</l>
     <l n="640">Between the ships that followed and her light ,</l>
     <l n="641">Then as to those behind , its flicker must seem</l>
     <l n="642">Wellnigh confused with those of Spain , he cried ,</l>
     <l n="643">“ Now , master bo'sun , quench their oriflamme ,</l>
     <l n="644">Dip their damned cresset in the good black Sea !</l>
     <l n="645">The rearmost light of Spain shall lead them now ,</l>
     <l n="646">A little closer , if they think it ours .</l>
     <l n="647">Pray God , they come to blows ! ”</l>
     <l n="648">Even as he spake</l>
     <l n="649">His cresset-flare went out in the thick night ;</l>
     <l n="650">A fluttering as of blind bewildered moths</l>
     <l n="651">A moment seized upon the shadowy ships</l>
     <l n="652">Behind him , then with crowded sail they steered</l>
     <l n="653">Straight for the rearmost cresset-flare of Spain .</l>

     <l n="1">Meanwhile , as in the gloom he slipped aside</l>
     <l n="2">Along the Spanish ranks , waiting the crash</l>
     <l n="3">Of battle , suddenly Drake became aware</l>
     <l n="4">Of strange sails bearing up into the wind</l>
     <l n="5">Around his right , and thought , “ the Armada strives</l>
     <l n="6">To weather us in the dark . ” Down went his helm ,</l>
     <l n="7">And all alone the little Revenge gave chase ,</l>
     <l n="8">Till as the moon crept slowly forth , she stood</l>
     <l n="9">Beside the ghostly ships , only to see</l>
     <l n="10">Bewildered Flemish merchantmen , amazed</l>
     <l n="11">With fears of Armageddon — such vast shrouds</l>
     <l n="12">Had lately passed them on the rolling seas .</l>
     <l n="13">Down went his helm again , with one grim curse</l>
     <l n="14">Upon the chance that led him thus astray ;</l>
     <l n="15">And down the wind the little Revenge once more</l>
     <l n="16">Swept on the trail . Fainter and fainter now</l>
     <l n="17">Glared the red beacons on the British coasts ,</l>
     <l n="18">And the wind slackened and the glimmering East</l>
     <l n="19">Greyed and reddened , yet Drake had not regained</l>
     <l n="20">Sight of the ships . When the full glory of dawn</l>
     <l n="21">Dazzled the sea , he found himself alone ,</l>
     <l n="22">With one huge galleon helplessly drifting</l>
     <l n="23">A cable'shYpppHeNlength away . Around her prow ,</l>
     <l n="24">Nuestra Señora del Rosario ,</l>
     <l n="25">Richly emblazoned , gold on red , proclaimed</l>
     <l n="26">The flagship of great Valdes , of the fleet</l>
     <l n="27">Of Andalusia , captain-general . She ,</l>
     <l n="28">Last night , in dark collision with the hulks</l>
     <l n="29">Of Spain , had lost her foremast . Through the night</l>
     <l n="30">Her guns , long rank on deadly rank , had kept</l>
     <l n="31">All enemies at bay . Drake summoned her</l>
     <l n="32">Instantly to surrender . She returned</l>
     <l n="33">A scornful answer from the glittering poop</l>
     <l n="34">Where two-score officers crowned the golden sea</l>
     <l n="35">And stained the dawn with blots of richer colour</l>
     <l n="36">Loftily clustered in the glowing sky ,</l>
     <l n="37">Doubleted with cramoisy velvet , wreathed</l>
     <l n="38">With golden chains , blazing with jewelled swords</l>
     <l n="39">And crusted poignards . “ What proud haste was this ? ”</l>
     <l n="40">They asked , glancing at their huge tiers of cannon</l>
     <l n="41">And crowded decks of swarthy soldiery ;</l>
     <l n="42">“ What madman in yon cockle-shell defied Spain ? ”</l>
     <l n="43">“ Tell them it is El Draque , ” he said , “ who lacks</l>
     <l n="44">The time to parley ; therefore it will be well</l>
     <l n="45">They strike at once , for I am in great haste . ”</l>
     <l n="46">There , at the sound of that renownèd name ,</l>
     <l n="47">Without a word down came their blazoned flag .</l>
     <l n="48">Like a great fragment of the dawn it lay</l>
     <l n="49">Crumpled upon their decks .. . .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="50">Into the soft bloom and Italian blue</l>
     <l n="51">Of sparkling , ever-beautiful Torbay ,</l>
     <l n="52">Belted as with warm Mediterranean crags ,</l>
     <l n="53">The little Revenge foamed with her mighty prize ,</l>
     <l n="54">A prize indeed — not for the casks of gold</l>
     <l n="55">Drake split in the rich sunlight and poured out</l>
     <l n="56">Like dross amongst his men , but in her hold</l>
     <l n="57">Lay many tons of powder , worth their weight</l>
     <l n="58">In rubies now to Britain . Into the hands</l>
     <l n="59">Of swarthy Brixham fishermen he gave</l>
     <l n="60">Prisoners and prize , then — loaded stem to stern</l>
     <l n="61">With powder and shot — their swiftest trawlers flew</l>
     <l n="62">Like falcons following a thunder-cloud</l>
     <l n="63">Behind him , as with crowded sail he rushed</l>
     <l n="64">On England 's trail once more . Like a caged lion</l>
     <l n="65">Drake paced his deck , praying he yet might reach</l>
     <l n="66">The fight in time ; and ever the warm light wind</l>
     <l n="67">Slackened . Not till the sun was half-way fallen</l>
     <l n="68">Once more crept out in front those dusky thrones</l>
     <l n="69">Of thunder , heaving on the smooth bright sea</l>
     <l n="70">From North to South with Howard 's clustered fleet</l>
     <l n="71">Like tiny clouds , becalmed , not half a mile</l>
     <l n="72">Behind the Spaniards . For the breeze had failed</l>
     <l n="73">Their blind midnight pursuit ; and now attack</l>
     <l n="74">Seemed hopeless . Even as Drake drew nigh , the last</l>
     <l n="75">Breath of the wind sank . One more day had flown ,</l>
     <l n="76">Nought was accomplished ; and the Armada lay</l>
     <l n="77">Some leagues of golden sea-way nearer now</l>
     <l n="78">To its great goal . The sun went down : the moon</l>
     <l n="79">Rose glittering . Hardly a cannon-shot apart</l>
     <l n="80">The two fleets lay becalmed upon the silver</l>
     <l n="81">Swell of the smooth night-tide . The hour had come</l>
     <l n="82">For Spain to strike . The ships of England drifted</l>
     <l n="83">Helplessly , at the mercy of those great hulks</l>
     <l n="84">Oared by their thousand slaves .</l>
     <l n="85">Onward they came ,</l>
     <l n="86">Swinging suddenly in tremendous gloom</l>
     <l n="87">Over the silver seas . But even as Drake ,</l>
     <l n="88">With eyes on fire at last for his last fight ,</l>
     <l n="89">Measured the distance ere he gave the word</l>
     <l n="90">To greet it with his cannon , suddenly</l>
     <l n="91">The shining face of the deep began to shiver</l>
     <l n="92">With dusky patches : the doomed English sails</l>
     <l n="93">Quivered and , filling smart from the North-east ,</l>
     <l n="94">The little Revenge rushed down their broken line</l>
     <l n="95">Signalling them to follow , and ere they knew</l>
     <l n="96">What miracle had saved them , they all sprang</l>
     <l n="97">Their luff and ran large out to sea . For now</l>
     <l n="98">The Armada lay to windward , and to fight</l>
     <l n="99">Meant to be grappled and overwhelmed ; but dark</l>
     <l n="100">Within the mind of Drake , a fiercer plan</l>
     <l n="101">Already had shaped itself .</l>
     <l n="102">“ They fly ! They fly ! ”</l>
     <l n="103">Rending the heavens from twice ten thousand throats</l>
     <l n="104">A mighty shout rose from the Spanish Fleet .</l>
     <l n="105">Over the moonlit waves their galleons came</l>
     <l n="106">Towering , crowding , plunging down the wind</l>
     <l n="107">In full chase , while the tempter , Drake , laughed low</l>
     <l n="108">To watch their solid battle-order break</l>
     <l n="109">And straggle . When once more the golden dawn</l>
     <l n="110">Dazzled the deep , the labouring galleons lay</l>
     <l n="111">Scattered by their unequal speed . The wind</l>
     <l n="112">Veered as the sun rose . Once again the ships</l>
     <l n="113">Of England lay to windward . Down swooped Drake</l>
     <l n="114">Where like a mountain the San Marcos heaved</l>
     <l n="115">Her giant flanks alone , having out-sailed</l>
     <l n="116">Her huge companions . Then the sea-winds blazed</l>
     <l n="117">With broadsides . Two long hours the sea flamed red</l>
     <l n="118">All round her . One by one the Titan ships</l>
     <l n="119">Came surging to her rescue , and met the buffet</l>
     <l n="120">Of battle-thunders , belching iron and flame ;</l>
     <l n="121">Nor could they pluck her forth from that red chaos</l>
     <l n="122">Till great Oquendo hurled his mighty prows</l>
     <l n="123">Crashing athwart those thunders , and once more</l>
     <l n="124">Gathered into unshakeable battle-order</l>
     <l n="125">The whole Armada raked the reeking seas .</l>
     <l n="126">Then up the wind the ships of England sheered</l>
     <l n="127">Once more , and one more day drew to its close ,</l>
     <l n="128">With little accomplished , half their powder spent ,</l>
     <l n="129">And all the Armada moving as of old ,</l>
     <l n="130">From sky to sky one heaven-wide zone of storm ,</l>
     <l n="131">( Though some three galleons out of all their host</l>
     <l n="132">Laboured woundily ) down the darkening Channel .</l>
     <l n="133">And all night long on England 's guardian heights</l>
     <l n="134">The beacons reddened , and all the next long day</l>
     <l n="135">The impregnable Armada never swerved</l>
     <l n="136">From its tremendous path . In vain did Drake ,</l>
     <l n="137">Frobisher , Hawkins , Howard , greatest names</l>
     <l n="138">In all our great sea-history , hover and dart</l>
     <l n="139">Like falcons round the mountainous array .</l>
     <l n="140">Till now , as night fell and they lay abreast</l>
     <l n="141">Of the Isle of Wight , once more the council flag</l>
     <l n="142">Flew from the little Revenge . With iron face</l>
     <l n="143">Thrust close to Howard 's , and outstretched iron arm ,</l>
     <l n="144">Under the stars Drake pointed down the coast</l>
     <l n="145">Where the red beacons flared . “ The shoals , ” he hissed ,</l>
     <l n="146">“ The shoals from Owers to Spithead and the net</l>
     <l n="147">Of channels yonder in Portsmouth Roads . At dawn</l>
     <l n="148">They 'll lie to leeward of the Invincible Fleet ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="149">Swiftly , in mighty sweeping lines Drake set</l>
     <l n="150">Before the council his fierce battle-plan</l>
     <l n="151">To drive the Armada down upon the banks</l>
     <l n="152">And utterly shatter it — stroke by well-schemed stroke</l>
     <l n="153">As he unfolded there his vital plot</l>
     <l n="154">And touched their dead cold warfare into life</l>
     <l n="155">Where plan before was none , he seemed to tower</l>
     <l n="156">Above them , clad with the deep night of stars ;</l>
     <l n="157">And those that late would rival knew him now ,</l>
     <l n="158">In all his great simplicity , their king ,</l>
     <l n="159">One of the gods of battle , England 's Drake ,</l>
     <l n="160">A soul that summoned Cæsar from his grave ,</l>
     <l n="161">And swept with Alexander o'er the deep .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="162">So when the dawn thro ’ rolling wreaths of cloud</l>
     <l n="163">Struggled , and all the waves were molten gold ,</l>
     <l n="164">The heart of Spain exulted , for she saw</l>
     <l n="165">The little fleet of England cloven in twain</l>
     <l n="166">As if by some strange discord . A light breeze</l>
     <l n="167">Blew from the ripening East ; and , up against it ,</l>
     <l n="168">Urged by the very madness of defeat ,</l>
     <l n="169">Or so it seemed , one half the British fleet</l>
     <l n="170">Drew nigh , towed by their boats , to challenge the vast</l>
     <l n="171">Tempest-winged heaving citadels of Spain ,</l>
     <l n="172">At last to the murderous grapple ; while far away</l>
     <l n="173">Their other half , led by the flag of Drake ,</l>
     <l n="174">Stood out to sea , as if to escape the doom</l>
     <l n="175">Of that sheer madness , for the light wind now</l>
     <l n="176">Could lend them no such wings to hover and swoop</l>
     <l n="177">As heretofore . Nearer the mad ships came</l>
     <l n="178">Towed by their boats , till now upon their right</l>
     <l n="179">To windward loomed the Fleet Invincible</l>
     <l n="180">With all its thunder-clouds , and on their left</l>
     <l n="181">To leeward , gleamed the perilous white shoals</l>
     <l n="182">With their long level lightnings under the cliffs</l>
     <l n="183">Of England , from the green glad garden of Wight</l>
     <l n="184">To the Owers and Selsea Bill . Right on they came ,</l>
     <l n="185">And suddenly the wrench of thundering cannon</l>
     <l n="186">Shook the vast hulks that towered above them . Red</l>
     <l n="187">Flamed the blue sea between . Thunder to thunder</l>
     <l n="188">Answered , and still the ships of Drake sped out</l>
     <l n="189">To the open sea . Sidonia saw them go ,</l>
     <l n="190">Furrowing the deep that like a pale-blue shield</l>
     <l n="191">Lay diamond-dazzled now in the full light .</l>
     <l n="192">Rich was the omen of that day for Spain ,</l>
     <l n="193">The feast-day of Sidonia 's patron-saint !</l>
     <l n="194">And the priests chanted and the trumpets blew</l>
     <l n="195">Triumphantly ! A universal shout</l>
     <l n="196">Went skyward from the locust-swarming decks ,</l>
     <l n="197">A shout that rent the golden morning clouds</l>
     <l n="198">From heaven to menacing heaven , as castle to castle</l>
     <l n="199">Flew the great battle-signal , and like one range</l>
     <l n="200">Of moving mountains , those almighty ranks</l>
     <l n="201">Swept down upon the small forsaken ships !</l>
     <l n="202">The lion 's brood was in the imperial nets</l>
     <l n="203">Of Spain at last . Onward the mountains came</l>
     <l n="204">With all their golden clouds of sail and flags</l>
     <l n="205">Like streaming cataracts ; all their glorious chasms</l>
     <l n="206">And glittering steeps , echoing , re-echoing ,</l>
     <l n="207">Calling , answering , as with the herald winds</l>
     <l n="208">That blow the golden trumpets of the morning</l>
     <l n="209">From Skiddaw to Helvellyn . In the midst</l>
     <l n="210">The great San Martin surged with heaven-wide press</l>
     <l n="211">Of proudly billowing sail ; and yet once more</l>
     <l n="212">Slowly , solemnly , like another dawn</l>
     <l n="213">Up to her mast-head soared in thunderous gold</l>
     <l n="214">The sacred standard of their last crusade ;</l>
     <l n="215">While round a hundred prows that heaved thro ’ heaven</l>
     <l n="216">Like granite cliffs , their black wet shining flanks ,</l>
     <l n="217">And swept like moving promontories , rolled</l>
     <l n="218">The splendid long-drawn thunders of the foam ,</l>
     <l n="219">And flashed the untamed white lightnings of the sea</l>
     <l n="220">Back to a morn unhalyarded of man ,</l>
     <l n="221">Back to the unleashed sun and blazoned clouds</l>
     <l n="222">And azure sky — the unfettered flag of God .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="223">Like one huge moving coast-line on they came</l>
     <l n="224">Crashing , and closed the ships of England round</l>
     <l n="225">With one fierce crescent of thunder and sweeping flame ,</l>
     <l n="226">One crimson scythe of Death , whose long sweep drowned</l>
     <l n="227">The eternal ocean with its mighty sound ,</l>
     <l n="228">From heaven to heaven , one roar , one glitter of doom ,</l>
     <l n="229">While out to the sea-line 's blue remotest bound</l>
     <l n="230">The ships of Drake still fled , and the red fume</l>
     <l n="231">Of battle thickened and shrouded shoal and sea with gloom .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="232">The distant sea , the close white menacing shoals</l>
     <l n="233">Are shrouded ! And the lion 's brood fight on !</l>
     <l n="234">And now death 's very midnight round them rolls ;</l>
     <l n="235">Rent is the flag that late so proudly shone !</l>
     <l n="236">The red decks reel and their last hope seems gone !</l>
     <l n="237">Round them they still keep clear one ring of sea :</l>
     <l n="238">It narrows ; but the lion 's brood fight on ,</l>
     <l n="239">Ungrappled still , still fearless and still free ,</l>
     <l n="240">While the white menacing shoals creep slowly out to lee .</l>

     <l n="241">Now through the red rents of each fire-cleft cloud ,</l>

     <l n="271">Of Howard and Frobisher , towed by their boats ,</l>
     <l n="272">Slipped away in the smoke , while out at sea</l>

     <l n="276">Invincible Fleet together upon the verge</l>
     <l n="277">Of doom . One awful surge of stormy wrath</l>
     <l n="278">Heaved thro ’ the struggling citadels of Spain .</l>
     <l n="279">From East to West their desperate signal flew ,</l>

     <l n="282">Careening tow'rds the shallows as they turned ,</l>
     <l n="283">Then in one wild stampede of sheer dismay</l>
     <l n="284">Rushed , tacking seaward , while the grey sea-plain</l>
     <l n="285">Smoked round them , and the cannonades of Drake</l>
     <l n="286">Raked their wild flight ; and the crusading flag ,</l>
     <l n="287">Tangled in one black maze of crashing spars ,</l>
     <l n="288">Whirled downward like the pride of Lucifer</l>
     <l n="289">From heaven to hell .</l>
     <l n="290">Out tow'rds the coasts of France</l>
     <l n="291">They plunged , narrowly weathering the Ower banks ;</l>
     <l n="292">Then , once again , they formed in ranks compact ,</l>
     <l n="293">Roundels impregnable , wrathfully bent at last</l>
     <l n="294">Never to swerve again from their huge path</l>
     <l n="295">And solid end — to join with Parma 's host ,</l>
     <l n="296">And hurl the whole of Europe on our isle .</l>
     <l n="297">Another day was gone , much powder spent ;</l>
     <l n="298">And , while Lord Howard exulted and conferred</l>
     <l n="299">Knighthoods on his brave seamen , Drake alone</l>

     <l n="302">Was lost of wrecking the Spaniards ere they joined</l>
     <l n="303">Parma . The night went by , and the next day ,</l>
     <l n="304">With scarce a visible scar the Invincible Fleet</l>
     <l n="305">Drew onwards tow'rds its goal , unshakeable now</l>
     <l n="306">In that grim battle-order . Beacons flared</l>
     <l n="307">Along the British coast , and pikes flashed out</l>
     <l n="308">All night , and a strange dread began to grip</l>
     <l n="309">The heart of England , as it seemed the might</l>
     <l n="310">Of seamen most renowned in all the world</l>
     <l n="311">Checked not that huge advance . Yet at the heart</l>
     <l n="312">Of Spain no less there clung a vampire fear</l>
     <l n="313">And strange foreboding , as the next day passed</l>
     <l n="314">Quietly , and behind her all day long</l>
     <l n="315">The shadowy ships of Drake stood on her trail</l>
     <l n="316">Quietly , patiently , as death or doom ,</l>
     <l n="317">Unswerving and implacable .</l>
     <l n="318">While the sun</l>
     <l n="319">Sank thro ’ long crimson fringes on that eve .</l>
     <l n="320">The fleets were passing Calais and the wind</l>
     <l n="321">Blew fair behind them . A strange impulse seized</l>
     <l n="322">Spain to shake off those bloodhounds from her trail ,</l>
     <l n="323">And suddenly the whole Invincible Fleet</l>
     <l n="324">Anchored , in hope the following wind would bear</l>
     <l n="325">The ships of England past and carry them down</l>
     <l n="326">To leeward . But their grim insistent watch</l>
     <l n="327">Was ready ; and though their van had wellnigh crashed</l>
     <l n="328">Into the rear of Spain , in the golden dusk ,</l>
     <l n="329">They , too , a cannon-shot away , at once</l>
     <l n="330">Anchored , to windward still .</l>
     <l n="331">Quietly heaved</l>
     <l n="332">The golden sea in that tremendous hour</l>
     <l n="333">Fraught with the fate of Europe and mankind ,</l>
     <l n="334">As yet once more the flag of council flew ,</l>
     <l n="335">And Hawkins , Howard , Frobisher , and Drake</l>
     <l n="336">Gathered together upon the little Revenge</l>
     <l n="337">While like a triumphing fire the news was borne</l>
     <l n="338">To Spain , already , that the Invincible Fleet</l>
     <l n="339">Had reached its end , ay , and “ that great black dog</l>
     <l n="340">Sir Francis Drake ” was writhing now in chains</l>
     <l n="341">Beneath the torturer 's hands .</l>
     <l n="342">High on his poop</l>
     <l n="343">He stood , a granite rock , above the throng</l>
     <l n="344">Of captains , there amid the breaking waves</l>
     <l n="345">Of clashing thought and swift opinion ,</l>
     <l n="346">Silent , gazing where now the cool fresh wind</l>
     <l n="347">Blew steadily up the terrible North Sea</l>
     <l n="348">Which rolled under the clouds into a gloom</l>
     <l n="349">Unfathomable . Once only his lips moved</l>
     <l n="350">Half-consciously , breathing those mighty words ,</l>
     <l n="351">The clouds His chariot ! Then , suddenly , he turned</l>
     <l n="352">And looked upon the little flock of ships</l>
     <l n="353">That followed on the fleet of England , sloops</l>
     <l n="354">Helpless in fight . These , manned by the brave zeal</l>
     <l n="355">Of many a noble house , from hour to hour</l>
     <l n="356">Had plunged out from the coast to join his flag .</l>
     <l n="357">“ Better if they had brought us powder and food</l>
     <l n="358">Than sought to join us thus , ” he had growled ; but now</l>
     <l n="359">“ Lord God , ” he cried aloud , “ they 'll light our road</l>
     <l n="360">To victory yet ! ” And in great sweeping strokes</l>
     <l n="361">Once more he drew his mighty battle-plan</l>
     <l n="362">Before the captains . In the thickening gloom</l>
     <l n="363">They stared at his grim face as at a man</l>
     <l n="364">Risen from hell , with all the powers of hell</l>
     <l n="365">At his command , a face tempered like steel</l>
     <l n="366">In the everlasting furnaces , a rock</l>
     <l n="367">Of adamant , while with a voice that blent</l>
     <l n="368">With the ebb and flow of the everlasting sea</l>
     <l n="369">He spake , and at the low deep menacing words</l>
     <l n="370">Monotonous with the unconquerable</l>
     <l n="371">Passion and level strength of his great soul</l>
     <l n="372">They shuddered ; for the man seemed more than man ,</l>
     <l n="373">And from his iron lips resounded doom</l>
     <l n="374">As from the lips of cannon , doom to Spain ,</l>
     <l n="375">Inevitable , unconquerable doom .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="376">And through that mighty host of Spain there crept</l>
     <l n="377">Cold winds of fear , as to the darkening sky</l>
     <l n="378">Once more from lips of kneeling thousands swept</l>
     <l n="379">The vespers of an Empire — one vast cry ,</l>
     <l n="380">SALVE REGINA ! God , what wild reply</l>
     <l n="381">Hissed from the clouds in that dark hour of dreams ?</l>
     <l n="382">AVE MARIA , those about to die</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="385">Thick as the ghosts that Dante saw in hell</l>
     <l n="386">Whirled on the blast thro ’ boundless leagues of pain ,</l>
     <l n="387">Thick , thick as wind-blown leaves innumerable ,</l>
     <l n="388">In the Inquisition 's yellow robes her slain</l>
     <l n="389">And tortured thousands , dense as the red rain</l>
     <l n="390">That wellnigh quenched her fires , went hissing by</l>

     <l n="422">Dawn , everlasting and omnipotent</l>
     <l n="423">Dawn rolled in crimson o'er the spar-strewn waves ,</l>
     <l n="424">As the last trumpet shall in thunder roll</l>
     <l n="425">O'er heaven and earth and ocean . Far away ,</l>
     <l n="426">The ships of Spain , great ragged piles of gloom</l>
     <l n="427">And shaggy splendour , leaning to the North</l>
     <l n="428">Like sun-shot clouds confused , or rent apart</l>
     <l n="429">In scattered squadrons , furiously plunged ,</l>
     <l n="430">Burying their mighty prows i ’ the broad grey rush</l>
     <l n="431">Of smoking billowy hills , or heaving high</l>
     <l n="432">Their giant bowsprits to the wandering heavens ,</l>
     <l n="433">Labouring in vain to return , struggling to lock</l>
     <l n="434">Their far-flung ranks anew , but drifting still</l>
     <l n="435">To leeward , driven by the ever-increasing storm</l>
     <l n="436">Straight for the dark North Sea . Hard by there lurched</l>
     <l n="437">One gorgeous galleon on the ravening shoals ,</l>
     <l n="438">Feeding the white maw of the famished waves</l>
     <l n="439">With gold and purple webs from kingly looms</l>
     <l n="440">And spilth of world-wide empires . Howard , still</l>
     <l n="441">Planning to pluck the Armada plume by plume ,</l>
     <l n="442">Swooped down upon that prey and swiftly engaged</l>
     <l n="443">Her desperate guns ; while Drake , our ocean-king ,</l>
     <l n="444">Knowing the full worth of that doom-fraught hour ,</l>
     <l n="445">Glanced neither to the left nor right , but stood</l>
     <l n="446">High on his poop , with calm implacable face</l>
     <l n="447">Gazing as into eternity , and steered</l>
     <l n="448">The crowded glory of his dawn-flushed sails</l>
     <l n="449">In superb onset , straight for the great fleet</l>
     <l n="450">Invincible ; and after him the main</l>
     <l n="451">Of England 's fleet , knowing its captain now ,</l>
     <l n="452">Followed , and with them rushed — from sky to sky</l>
     <l n="453">One glittering charge of wrath — the storm 's white waves ,</l>
     <l n="454">The twenty thousand foaming chariots</l>
     <l n="455">Of God .</l>
     <l n="456">None but the everlasting voice</l>
     <l n="457">Of him who fought at Salamis might sing</l>
     <l n="458">The fight of that dread Sabbath . Not mankind</l>
     <l n="459">Waged it alone . War raged in heaven that day ,</l>
     <l n="460">Where Michael and his angels drave once more</l>
     <l n="461">The hosts of darkness ruining down the abyss</l>
     <l n="462">Of chaos . Light against darkness , Liberty</l>
     <l n="463">Against all dark old despotism , unsheathed</l>
     <l n="464">The sword in that great hour . Behind the strife</l>
     <l n="465">Of men embattled deeps beyond all thought</l>
     <l n="466">Moved in their awful panoply , as move</l>
     <l n="467">Silent , invisible , swift , under the clash</l>
     <l n="468">Of waves and flash of foam , huge ocean-glooms</l>
     <l n="469">And vast reserves of inappellable power .</l>
     <l n="470">The bowsprits ranked on either fore-front seemed</l>
     <l n="471">But spear-heads of those dread antagonists</l>
     <l n="472">Invisible : the shuddering sails of Spain</l>
     <l n="473">Dusk with the shadow of death , the sunward sails</l>
     <l n="474">Of England full-fraught with the breath of God .</l>
     <l n="475">Onward the ships of England and God 's waves</l>
     <l n="476">Triumphantly charged , glittering companions ,</l>
     <l n="477">And poured their thunders on the extreme right</l>
     <l n="478">Of Spain , whose giant galleons as they lurched</l>
     <l n="479">Heavily to the roughening sea and wind</l>
     <l n="480">With all their grinding , wrenching cannon , worked</l>
     <l n="481">On rolling platforms by the helpless hands</l>
     <l n="482">Of twenty thousand soldiers , without skill</l>
     <l n="483">In stormy seas , rent the indifferent sky</l>
     <l n="484">Or tore the black troughs of the swirling deep</l>
     <l n="485">In vain , while volley on volley of flame and iron</l>
     <l n="486">Burst thro ’ their four-foot beams , fierce raking blasts</l>
     <l n="487">From ships that came and went on wings of the wind</l>
     <l n="488">All round their mangled bulk , scarce a pike 's thrust</l>
     <l n="489">Away , sweeping their decks from stem to stern</l>
     <l n="490">( Between the rush and roar of the great green waves )</l>
     <l n="491">With crimson death , rending their timbered towns</l>
     <l n="492">And populous floating streets into wild squares</l>
     <l n="493">Of slaughter and devastation ; driving them down ,</l>
     <l n="494">Huddled on their own centre , cities of shame</l>
     <l n="495">And havoc , in fiery forests of tangled wrath ,</l>
     <l n="496">With hurricanes of huge masts and swarming spars</l>
     <l n="497">And multitudinous decks that heaved and sank</l>
     <l n="498">Like earthquake-smitten palaces , when doom</l>
     <l n="499">Comes , with one stride , across the pomp of kings .</l>
     <l n="500">All round them shouted the everlasting sea ,</l>
     <l n="501">Burst in white thunders on the streaming poops</l>
     <l n="502">And blinded fifty thousand eyes with spray .</l>
     <l n="503">Once , as a gorgeous galleon , drenched with blood</l>
     <l n="504">Began to founder and settle , a British captain</l>
     <l n="505">Called from his bulwarks , bidding her fierce crew</l>
     <l n="506">Surrender and come aboard . Straight through the heart</l>
     <l n="507">A hundred muskets answered that appeal .</l>
     <l n="508">Sink or destroy ! The deadly signal flew</l>
     <l n="509">From mast to mast of England . Once , twice , thrice ,</l>
     <l n="510">A huge sea-castle heaved her haggled bulk</l>
     <l n="511">Heavenward , and with a cry that rent the heavens</l>
     <l n="512">From all her crowded decks , and one deep roar</l>
     <l n="513">As of a cloven world or the dark surge</l>
     <l n="514">Of chaos yawning , sank : the swirling slopes</l>
     <l n="515">Of the sweeping billowy hills for a moment swarmed</l>
     <l n="516">With struggling insect-men , sprinkling the foam</l>
     <l n="517">With tossing arms ; then the indifferent sea</l>
     <l n="518">Rolled its grey smoking waves across the place</l>
     <l n="519">Where they had been . Here a great galleasse poured</l>
     <l n="520">Red rivers through her scuppers and torn flanks ,</l>
     <l n="521">And there a galleon , wrapped in creeping fire ,</l>
     <l n="522">Suddenly like a vast volcano split</l>
     <l n="523">Asunder , and o'er the vomiting sulphurous clouds</l>
     <l n="524">And spouting spread of crimson , flying spars</l>
     <l n="525">And heads torn from their trunks and scattered limbs</l>
     <l n="526">Leapt , hideous gouts of death , against the glare .</l>
     <l n="527">Hardly the thrust of a pike away , the ships</l>
     <l n="528">Of England flashed and swerved , till in one mass</l>
     <l n="529">Of thunder-blasted splendour and shuddering gloom</l>
     <l n="530">Those gorgeous floating citadels huddled and shrank</l>
     <l n="531">Their towers , and all the glory of dawn that rolled</l>
     <l n="532">And burned along the tempest of their banners</l>
     <l n="533">Withered , as on a murderer 's face the light</l>
     <l n="534">Withers before the accuser . All their proud</l>
     <l n="535">Castles and towers and heaven-wide clouds of sail</l>
     <l n="536">Shrank to a darkening horror , like the heart</l>
     <l n="537">Of Evil , plucked from midnight 's fiercest gloom ,</l>
     <l n="538">With all its curses quivering and alive ;</l>
     <l n="539">A horror of wild masts and tangled spars ,</l>
     <l n="540">Like some great kraken with a thousand arms</l>
     <l n="541">Torn from the filthiest cavern of the deep ,</l>
     <l n="542">Writhing , and spewing forth its venomous fumes</l>
     <l n="543">On every side . Sink or destroy !— all day</l>
     <l n="544">The deadly signal flew ; and ever the sea</l>
     <l n="545">Swelled higher , and the flashes of the foam</l>
     <l n="546">Broadened and leapt and spread as a wild white fire</l>
     <l n="547">That flourishes with the wind ; and ever the storm</l>
     <l n="548">Drave the grim battle onward to the wild</l>
     <l n="549">Menace of the dark North Sea . At set of sun ,</l>
     <l n="550">Even as below the sea-line the broad disc</l>
     <l n="551">Sank like a red-hot cannon-ball through scurf</l>
     <l n="552">Of seething molten lead , the Santa Maria</l>
     <l n="553">Uttering one cry that split the heart of heaven</l>
     <l n="554">Went down with all hands , roaring into the dark .</l>
     <l n="555">Hardly five rounds of shot were left to Drake !</l>
     <l n="556">Gun after gun fell silent , as the night</l>
     <l n="557">Deepened — “ Yet we must follow them to the North , ”</l>
     <l n="558">He cried , “ or they 'll return yet to shake hands</l>
     <l n="559">With Parma ! Come , we 'll put a brag upon it ,</l>
     <l n="560">And hunt them onward as we lacked for nought ! ”</l>
     <l n="561">So , when across the swinging smoking seas ,</l>
     <l n="562">Grey and splendid and terrible broke the day</l>
     <l n="563">Once more , the flying Invincible fleet beheld</l>
     <l n="564">Upon their weather-beam , and dogging them</l>
     <l n="565">Like their own shadow , the dark ships of Drake ,</l>
     <l n="566">Unswerving and implacable . Ever the wind</l>
     <l n="567">And sea increased ; till now the heaving deep</l>
     <l n="568">Swelled all around them into sulky hills</l>
     <l n="569">And rolling mountains , whose majestic crests ,</l>
     <l n="570">Like wild white flames far blown and savagely flickering</l>
     <l n="571">Swept thro ’ the clouds ; and , on their vanishing slopes ,</l>
     <l n="572">Past the pursuing fleet began to swirl</l>
     <l n="573">Scores of horses and mules , drowning or drowned ,</l>
     <l n="574">Cast overboard to lighten the wild flight</l>
     <l n="575">Of Spain , and save her water-casks , a trail</l>
     <l n="576">Telling of utmost fear . And ever the storm</l>
     <l n="577">Soared louder across the leagues of rioting sea ,</l>
     <l n="578">Driving her onward like a mighty stag</l>
     <l n="579">Chased by the wolves . Off the dark Firth of Forth</l>
     <l n="580">At last , Drake signalled and lay head to wind ,</l>
     <l n="581">Watching . “ The chariots of God are twenty thousand , ”</l>
     <l n="582">He muttered , as , for a moment close at hand ,</l>
     <l n="583">Caught in some league-wide whirlpool of the sea ,</l>
     <l n="584">The mighty galleons crowded and towered and plunged</l>
     <l n="585">Above him on the huge o'erhanging billows ,</l>
     <l n="586">As if to crash down on his decks ; the next ,</l>
     <l n="587">A mile of ravening sea had swept between</l>
     <l n="588">Each of those wind-whipt straws and they were gone ,</l>
     <l n="589">With all their tiny shrivelling scrolls of sail ,</l>
     <l n="590">Through roaring deserts of embattled death ,</l>
     <l n="591">Where like a hundred thousand chariots charged</l>
     <l n="592">With lightnings and with thunders , the great deep</l>
     <l n="593">Hurled them away to the North . From sky to sky</l>
     <l n="594">One blanching bursting storm of infinite seas</l>
     <l n="595">Followed them , broad white cataracts , hills that grasped</l>
     <l n="596">With struggling Titan hands at reeling heavens ,</l>
     <l n="597">And roared their doom-fraught greetings from Cape Wrath</l>
     <l n="598">Round to the Bloody Foreland .</l>
     <l n="599">There should the yeast</l>
     <l n="600">Of foam receive the purple of many kings ,</l>
     <l n="601">And the grim gulfs devour the blood-bought gold</l>
     <l n="602">Of Aztecs and of Incas , and the reefs ,</l>
     <l n="603">League after league , bristle with mangled spars ,</l>
     <l n="604">And all along their coasts the murderous kerns</l>
     <l n="605">Of Catholic Ireland strip the gorgeous silks</l>
     <l n="606">And chains and jewel-encrusted crucifixes</l>
     <l n="607">From thousands dead , and slaughter thousands more</l>
     <l n="608">With gallow-glass axes as they blindly crept</l>
     <l n="609">Forth from the surf and jagged rocks to seek</l>
     <l n="610">Pity of their own creed .</l>
     <l n="611">To meet that doom</l>
     <l n="612">Drake watched their sails go shrivelling , till the last</l>
     <l n="613">Flicker of spars vanished as a skeleton leaf</l>
     <l n="614">Upon the blasts of winter , and there was nought</l>
     <l n="615">But one wide wilderness of splendour and gloom</l>
     <l n="616">Under the northern clouds .</l>
     <l n="617">“ Not unto us , ”</l>
     <l n="618">Cried Drake , “ not unto us — but unto Him</l>
     <l n="619">Who made the sea , belongs our England now !</l>
     <l n="620">Pray God that heart and mind and soul we prove</l>
     <l n="621">Worthy among the nations of this hour</l>
     <l n="622">And this great victory , whose ocean fame</l>
     <l n="623">Shall wash the world with thunder till that day</l>
     <l n="624">When there is no more sea , and the strong cliffs</l>
     <l n="625">Pass like a smoke , and the last peal of it</l>
     <l n="626">Sounds thro ’ the trumpet . ”</l>
     <l n="627">So , with close-hauled sails ,</l>
     <l n="628">Over the rolling triumph of the deep ,</l>
     <l n="629">Lifting their hearts to heaven , they turned back home .</l>
