      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">Until she died we never knew</l>
       <l n="2">The beauty of our faith in God .</l>
       <l n="3">We 'd seen the summer roses nod</l>
       <l n="4">And wither as the tempests blew ,</l>
       <l n="5">Through many a spring we 'd lived to see</l>
       <l n="6">The buds returning to the tree .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="7">We had not felt the touch of woe ;</l>
       <l n="8">What cares had come , had lightly flown ;</l>
       <l n="9">Our burdens we had borne alone —</l>
       <l n="10">The need of God we did not know .</l>
       <l n="11">It seemed sufficient through the days</l>
       <l n="12">To think and act in worldly ways .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="13">And then she closed her eyes in sleep ;</l>

       <l n="15">No more our lives would know her smile .</l>
       <l n="16">And oh , the hurt of it went deep !</l>
       <l n="17">It seemed to us that we must fall</l>
       <l n="18">Before the anguish of it all .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="19">Our faith , which had not known the test ,</l>
       <l n="20">Then blossomed with its comfort sweet ,</l>
       <l n="21">Promised that some day we should meet</l>
       <l n="22">And whispered to us : “ He knows best . ”</l>
       <l n="23">And when our bitter tears were dried ,</l>
       <l n="24">We found our faith was glorified .</l>

      <head>THE CALL</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">I must get out to the woods again , to the whispering tree , and the</l>
       <l n="2">birds a-wing ,</l>
       <l n="3">Away from the haunts of pale-faced men , to the spaces wide where</l>
       <l n="4">strength is king ;</l>
       <l n="5">I must get out where the skies are blue and the air is clean and the</l>
       <l n="6">rest is sweet ,</l>
       <l n="7">Out where there 's never a task to do or a goal to reach or a foe to meet .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="8">I must get out on the trails once more that wind through shadowy haunts</l>
       <l n="9">and cool ,</l>
       <l n="10">Away from the presence of wall and door , and see myself in a crystal pool ;</l>
       <l n="11">I must get out with the silent things , where neither laughter nor hate</l>
       <l n="12">is heard ,</l>
       <l n="13">Where malice never the humblest stings and no one is hurt by a spoken</l>
       <l n="14">word .</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>Oh , I 've heard the call of the tall white pine , and heard the call of the running brook ; I 'm tired of the tasks which each day are mine , I 'm weary of reading a printed book ; I want to get out of the din and strife , the clang and clamor of turning wheel , And walk for a day where life is life , and the joys are true and the pictures real .</p>

       <l n="1">I have no wealth of gold to give away ,</l>
       <l n="2">But I can pledge to worthy causes these :</l>
       <l n="3">I 'll give my strength , my days and hours of ease ,</l>
       <l n="4">My finest thought and courage when I may ,</l>
       <l n="5">And take some deed accomplished for my pay .</l>
       <l n="6">I cannot offer much in silver fees ,</l>
       <l n="7">But I can serve when richer persons play ,</l>
       <l n="8">And with my presence fill some vacancies .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="9">There are some things beyond the gift of gold ,</l>
       <l n="10">A richer treasure 's needed now and then ;</l>
       <l n="11">Some joys life needs which are not bought and sold —</l>
       <l n="12">The high occasion often calls for men .</l>
       <l n="13">Some for release from service give their pelf ,</l>
       <l n="14">But he gives most who freely gives himself .</l>
