    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="2">An hour before the race they talked together</l>
     <l n="3">A pair of lovers in the mild March weather ,</l>
     <l n="4">Charles Cothill and the golden lady , Em .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="5">Beautiful England 's hands had fashioned them .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="6">He was from Sleins , that manor up the Lithe ;</l>
     <l n="7">Riding the Downs had made his body blithe ;</l>
     <l n="8">Stalwart he was , and springy , hardened , swift ,</l>
     <l n="9">Able for perfect speed with perfect thrift ,</l>
     <l n="10">Man to the core yet moving like a lad .</l>
     <l n="11">Dark honest eyes with merry gaze he had ,</l>
     <l n="12">A fine firm mouth , and wind-tan on his skin .</l>
     <l n="13">He was to ride and ready to begin .</l>
     <l n="14">He was to ride Right Royal , his own horse ,</l>
     <l n="15">In the English Chaser 's Cup on Compton Course .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="16">Under the pale coat reaching to his spurs</l>
     <l n="17">One saw his colours , which were also hers ,</l>
     <l n="18">Narrow alternate bars of blue and white</l>
     <l n="19">Blue as the speedwell 's eye and silver bright .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="20">What with hard work and waiting for the race ,</l>
     <l n="21">Trouble and strain were marked upon his face ;</l>
     <l n="22">Men would have said that something worried him .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="23">She was a golden lady , dainty , trim ,</l>
     <l n="24">As like the love time as laburnum blossom .</l>
     <l n="25">Mirth , truth and goodness harboured in her bosom .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="26">Pure colour and pure contour and pure grace</l>
     <l n="27">Made the sweet marvel of her singing face ;</l>
     <l n="28">She was the very may-time that comes in</l>
     <l n="29">When hawthorns bud and nightingales begin .</l>
     <l n="30">To see her tread the red-tippt daisies white</l>
     <l n="31">In the green fields all golden with delight ,</l>
     <l n="32">Was to believe Queen Venus come again ,</l>
     <l n="33">She was as dear as sunshine after rain ;</l>
     <l n="34">Such loveliness this golden lady had .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="35">All lovely things and pure things made her glad ,</l>
     <l n="36">But most she loved the things her lover loved ,</l>
     <l n="37">The windy Downlands where the kestrels roved ,</l>
     <l n="38">The sea of grasses that the wind runs over</l>
     <l n="39">Where blundering beetles drunken from the clover</l>
     <l n="40">Stumble about the startled passer-by .</l>
     <l n="41">There on the great grass underneath the sky</l>
     <l n="42">She loved to ride with him for hours on hours ,</l>
     <l n="43">Smelling the seasoned grass and those small flowers ,</l>
     <l n="44">Milkworts and thymes , that grow upon the Downs .</l>
     <l n="45">There from a chalk edge they would see the towns :</l>
     <l n="46">Smoke above trees , by day , or spires of churches</l>
     <l n="47">Gleaming with swinging wind-cocks on their perches .</l>
     <l n="48">Or windows flashing in the light , or trains</l>
     <l n="49">Burrowing below white smoke across the plains .</l>
     <l n="50">By night , the darkness of the valley set</l>
     <l n="51">With scattered lights to where the ridges met</l>
     <l n="52">And three great glares making the heaven dun ,</l>
     <l n="53">Oxford and Wallingford and Abingdon .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="54">“ Dear , in an hour , ” said Charles , “ the race begins .</l>
     <l n="55">Before I start I must confess my sins .</l>
     <l n="56">For I have sinned , and now it troubles me . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="57">“ I saw that you were sad , ” said Emily .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="58">“ Before I speak , ” said Charles , “ I must premise .</l>
     <l n="59">You were not here to help me to be wise ,</l>
     <l n="60">And something happened , difficult to tell .</l>
     <l n="61">Even if I sinned , I feel I acted well ,</l>
     <l n="62">From inspiration , mad as that may seem .</l>
     <l n="63">Just at the grey of dawn I had a dream .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="64">It was the strangest dream I ever had .</l>
     <l n="65">It was the dream that drove me to be mad .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="66">I dreamed I stood upon the race-course here ,</l>
     <l n="67">Watching a blinding rainstorm blowing clear ,</l>
     <l n="68">And as it blew away I said aloud ,</l>
     <l n="69">‘ That rain will make soft going on the ploughed . ’</l>
     <l n="70">And instantly I saw the whole great course ,</l>
     <l n="71">The grass , the brooks , the fences toppt with gorse ,</l>
     <l n="72">Gleam in the sun ; and all the ploughland shone</l>
     <l n="73">Blue , like a marsh , though now the rain had gone .</l>
     <l n="74">And in my dream I said , ‘ That plough will be</l>
     <l n="75">Terrible work for some , but not for me .</l>
     <l n="76">Not for Right Royal . ’</l>
     <l n="77">And a voice said , ‘ No</l>
     <l n="78">Not for Right Royal . ’</l>
     <l n="79">And I looked , and lo</l>
     <l n="80">There was Right Royal , speaking , at my side .</l>
     <l n="81">The horse 's very self , and yet his hide</l>
     <l n="82">Was like , what shall I say ? like pearl on fire ,</l>
     <l n="83">A white soft glow of burning that did twire</l>
     <l n="84">Like soft white-heat with every breath he drew .</l>
     <l n="85">A glow , with utter brightness running through ;</l>
     <l n="86">Most splendid , though I cannot make you see .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="87">His great crest glittered as he looked at me</l>
     <l n="88">Criniered with spitting sparks ; he stamped the ground</l>
     <l n="89">All cock and fire , trembling like a hound ,</l>
     <l n="90">And glad of me , and eager to declare</l>
     <l n="91">His horse 's mind .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="92">And I was made aware</l>
     <l n="93">That , being a horse , his mind could only say</l>
     <l n="94">Few things to me . He said , ‘ It is my day ,</l>
     <l n="95">My day , to-day ; I shall not have another . ’</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="96">And as he spoke he seemed a younger brother</l>
     <l n="97">Most near , and yet a horse , and then he grinned</l>
     <l n="98">And tossed his crest and crinier to the wind</l>
     <l n="99">And looked down to the Water with an eye</l>
     <l n="100">All fire of soul to gallop dreadfully .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="101">All this was strange , but then a stranger thing</l>
     <l n="102">Came afterwards . I woke all shivering</l>
     <l n="103">With wonder and excitement , yet with dread</l>
     <l n="104">Lest the dream meant that Royal should be dead ,</l>
     <l n="105">Lest he had died and come to tell me so .</l>
     <l n="106">I hurried out ; no need to hurry , though ;</l>
     <l n="107">There he was shining like a morning star .</l>
     <l n="108">Now hark . You know how cold his manners are ,</l>
     <l n="109">Never a whinny for his dearest friend .</l>
     <l n="110">To-day he heard me at the courtyard end ,</l>
     <l n="111">He left his breakfast with a shattering call ,</l>
     <l n="112">A View Halloo , and , swinging in his stall ,</l>
     <l n="113">Ran up to nuzzle me with signs of joy .</l>
     <l n="114">It staggered Harding and the stable-boy .</l>
     <l n="115">And Harding said , ‘ What 's come to him to-day ?</l>
     <l n="116">He must have had a dream he beat the bay . ’</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="19">
     <l n="117">Now that was strange ; and , what was stranger , this .</l>
     <l n="118">I know he tried to say those words of his ,</l>
     <l n="119">‘ It is my day ’ ; and Harding turned to me ,</l>
     <l n="120">‘ It is his day to-day , that 's plain to see . ’</l>
     <l n="121">Right Royal nuzzled at me as he spoke .</l>
     <l n="122">That staggered me . I felt that I should choke .</l>
     <l n="123">It came so pat upon my unsaid thought ,</l>
     <l n="124">I asked him what he meant .</l>
     <l n="125">He answered ‘ Naught .</l>
     <l n="126">It only came into my head to say .</l>
     <l n="127">But there it is . To-day 's Right Royal 's day . ’</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="20">
     <l n="128">That was the dream . I cannot put the glory</l>
     <l n="129">With which it filled my being , in a story .</l>
     <l n="130">No one can tell a dream .</l>
     <l n="131">Now to confess .</l>
     <l n="132">The dream made daily life a nothingness ,</l>
     <l n="133">Merely a mould which white-hot beauty fills ,</l>
     <l n="134">Pure from some source of passionate joys and skills .</l>
     <l n="135">And being flooded with my vision thus ,</l>
     <l n="136">Certain of winning , puffed and glorious ,</l>
     <l n="137">Walking upon this earth-top like a king ,</l>
     <l n="138">My judgment went . I did a foolish thing ,</l>
     <l n="139">I backed myself to win with all I had .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="21">
     <l n="140">Now that it 's done I see that it was mad ,</l>
     <l n="141">But still , I had to do it , feeling so .</l>
     <l n="142">That is the full confession ; now you know . ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>SHE The thing is done , and being done , must be . You cannot hedge . Would you had talked with me Before you plunged . But there , the thing is done .</p>
   <p>HE Do not exaggerate the risks I run . Right Royal was a bad horse in the past , A rogue , a cur , but he is cured at last ; For I was right , his former owner wrong , He is a game good chaser going strong . He and my lucky star may pull me through .</p>
   <p>SHE O grant they may ; but think what 's racing you , Think for a moment what his chances are Against Sir Lopez , Soyland , Kubbadar .</p>
   <p>HE You said you thought Sir Lopez past his best . I do , myself .</p>
   <p>SHE But there are all the rest . Peterkinooks , Red Ember , Counter Vair , And then Grey Glory and the Irish mare .</p>
   <p>HE She 's scratched . The rest are giving me a stone . Unless the field hides something quite unknown I stand a chance . The going favours me . The ploughland will be bogland certainly , After this rain . If Royal keeps his nerve , If no one cannons me at jump or swerve , I stand a chance . And though I dread to fail , This passionate dream that drives me like a sail Runs in my blood , and cries , that I shall win .</p>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Please Heaven you may ; but now ( for me ) begin</l>
     <l n="2">Again the horrors that I cannot tell ,</l>
     <l n="3">Horrors that made my childhood such a hell ,</l>
     <l n="4">Watching my Father near the gambler 's grave</l>
     <l n="5">Step after step , yet impotent to save .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="6">You do not know , I never let you know ,</l>
     <l n="7">The horror of those days of long ago</l>
     <l n="8">When Father raced to ruin . Every night</l>
     <l n="9">After my Mother took away the light</l>
     <l n="10">For weeks before each meeting , I would see</l>
     <l n="11">Horrible horses looking down on me</l>
     <l n="12">Laughing and saying “ We shall beat your Father . ”</l>
     <l n="13">Then when the meetings came I used to gather</l>
     <l n="14">Close up to Mother , and we used to pray .</l>
     <l n="15">“ O God , for Christ 's sake , let him win to-day . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="16">And then we had to watch for his return ,</l>
     <l n="17">Craning our necks to see if we could learn ,</l>
     <l n="18">Before he entered , what the week had been .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="19">Now I shall look on such another scene</l>
     <l n="20">Of waiting on the race-chance . For to-day ,</l>
     <l n="21">Just as I did with Father , I shall say</l>
     <l n="22">“ Yes , he 'll be beaten by a head , or break</l>
     <l n="23">A stirrup leather at the wall , or take</l>
     <l n="24">The brook too slow , and , then , all will be lost . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="25">Daily , in mind , I saw the Winning Post ,</l>
     <l n="26">The Straight , and all the horses ’ glimmering forms</l>
     <l n="27">Rushing between the railings ’ yelling swarms ,</l>
     <l n="28">My Father 's colours leading . Every day ,</l>
     <l n="29">Closing my eyes , I saw them die away ,</l>
     <l n="30">In the last strides , and lose , lose by a neck ,</l>
     <l n="31">Lose by an inch , but lose , and bring the wreck</l>
     <l n="32">A day 's march nearer . Now begins again</l>
     <l n="33">The agony of waiting for the pain .</l>
     <l n="34">The agony of watching ruin come</l>
     <l n="35">Out of man 's dreams to overwhelm a home .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="36">Go now , my dear . Before the race is due ,</l>
     <l n="37">We 'll meet again , and then I 'll speak with you .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="38">In a race-course box behind the Stand</l>
     <l n="39">Right Royal shone from a strapper 's hand .</l>
     <l n="40">A big dark bay with a restless tread ,</l>
     <l n="41">Fetlock deep in a wheat-straw bed ;</l>
     <l n="42">A noble horse of a nervy blood ,</l>
     <l n="43">By O Mon Roi out of Rectitude</l>
     <l n="44">Something quick in his eye and ear</l>
     <l n="45">Gave a hint that he might be queer .</l>
     <l n="46">In front , he was all to a horseman 's mind ,</l>
     <l n="47">Some thought him a trifle light behind .</l>
     <l n="48">By two good points might his rank be known ,</l>
     <l n="49">A beautiful head and a Jumping Bone .</l>
     <l n="50">He had been the hope of Sir Button Budd ,</l>
     <l n="51">Who bred him there at the Fletchings stud ,</l>
     <l n="52">But the Fletchings jockey had flogged him cold</l>
     <l n="53">In a narrow thing as a two-year-old .</l>
     <l n="54">After that , with his sulks and swerves ,</l>
     <l n="55">Dread of the crowd and fits of nerves ,</l>
     <l n="56">Like a wastrel bee who makes no honey</l>
     <l n="57">He had hardly earned his entry money .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="58">Liking him still , though he failed at racing ,</l>
     <l n="59">Sir Button trained him for steeple-chasing .</l>
     <l n="60">He jumped like a stag , but his heart was cowed ;</l>
     <l n="61">Nothing would make him face the crowd ;</l>
     <l n="62">When he reached the Straight where the crowds began</l>
     <l n="63">He would make no effort for any man .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="64">Sir Button sold him , Charles Cothill bought him ,</l>
     <l n="65">Rode him to hounds and soothed and taught him .</l>
     <l n="66">After two years ’ care Charles felt assured</l>
     <l n="67">That his horse 's broken heart was cured ,</l>
     <l n="68">And the jangled nerves in tune again .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="69">And now , as proud as a King of Spain ,</l>
     <l n="70">He moved in his box with a restless tread ,</l>
     <l n="71">His eyes like sparks in his lovely head ,</l>
     <l n="72">Ready to run between the roar</l>
     <l n="73">Of the stands that face the Straight once more ;</l>
     <l n="74">Ready to race , though blown , though beat ,</l>
     <l n="75">As long as his will could lift his feet ,</l>
     <l n="76">Ready to burst his heart to pass</l>
     <l n="77">Each gasping horse in that street of grass .</l>
     <l n="78">John Harding said to his stable-boy ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="79">“ Would looks were deeds , for he looks a joy .</l>
     <l n="80">He 's come on well in the last ten days . ”</l>
     <l n="81">The horse looked up at the note of praise ,</l>
     <l n="82">He fixed his eye upon Harding 's eye ,</l>
     <l n="83">Then he put all thought of Harding by ,</l>
     <l n="84">Then his ears went back and he clipped all clean</l>
     <l n="85">The manger 's well where his oats had been .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">

     <l n="125">There are eight in this could give him a stone ,</l>

     <lg type="stanza" n="234">
      <l n="1344">Charles thought , “ He is dying , and this is the end ,</l>

      <l n="1350">It was Cimmeroon rushing , his lips twitcht apart ,</l>
      <l n="1351">His eyes rolled back sightless , and death in his heart .</l>

     <lg type="stanza" n="235">
      <l n="1354">A gush of bright blood filled his mouth as he sank ,</l>

      <l n="1406">Then they strode the green grass for the Lost Lady 's grave ,</l>

      <l n="1526">There were only two others , going level alone ,</l>
      <l n="1527">First the spotted cream jacket , then the blue , white and roan .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="272">
      <l n="1528">Up the street of green race-course they strained for the prize ,</l>
      <l n="1529">While the stands blurred with waving and the air shook with cries :</l>
      <l n="1530">“ Now , Sir Lopez ! ” “ Come , Soyland ! ” “ Now , Sir Lopez ! Now , now ! ”</l>
      <l n="1531">Then Charles judged his second , but he could not tell how .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="273">
      <l n="1532">But a glory of sureness leaped from horse into man ,</l>
      <l n="1533">And the man said , “ Now , beauty , ” and the horse said , “ I can . ”</l>
      <l n="1534">And the long weary Royal made an effort the more ,</l>
      <l n="1535">Though his heart thumped like drum-beats as he went to the fore .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="274">
      <l n="1536">Neck and neck went Sir Lopez and Soyland together ,</l>
      <l n="1537">Soyland first , a short head , with his neck all in lather ;</l>
      <l n="1538">Both were ridden their hardest , both were doing their best ,</l>
      <l n="1539">Right Royal reached Soyland and came to his chest .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="275">
      <l n="1540">There Soyland 's man saw him with the heel of his eye ,</l>
      <l n="1541">A horse with an effort that could beat him or tie ;</l>
      <l n="1542">Then he glanced at Sir Lopez , and he bit through his lip ,</l>
      <l n="1543">And he drove in his spurs and he took up his whip .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="276">
      <l n="1544">There he lashed the game Soyland who had given his all ,</l>
      <l n="1545">And he gave three strides more , and then failed at the call ,</l>
      <l n="1546">And he dropped behind Royal like a leaf in a tide :</l>
      <l n="1547">Then Sir Lopez and Royal ran on side by side .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="277">
      <l n="1548">There they looked at each other , and they rode , and were grim ;</l>
      <l n="1549">Charles thought , “ That 's Sir Lopez . I shall never beat him . ”</l>
      <l n="1550">All the yells for Sir Lopez seemed to darken the air ,</l>
      <l n="1551">They were rushing past Emmy and the White Post was there .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="278">
      <l n="1552">He drew to Sir Lopez ; but Sir Lopez drew clear ;</l>
      <l n="1553">Right Royal clung to him and crept to his ear .</l>
      <l n="1554">Then the man on Sir Lopez judged the moment had come</l>
      <l n="1555">For the last ounce of effort that would bring his horse home .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="279">
      <l n="1556">So he picked up his whip for three swift slashing blows ,</l>
      <l n="1557">And Sir Lopez drew clear , but Right Royal stuck close .</l>
      <l n="1558">Charles sat still as stone , for he dared not to stir —</l>
      <l n="1559">There was that in Right Royal that needed no spur .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="280">
      <l n="1560">In the trembling of an instant power leaped up within ,</l>
      <l n="1561">Royal 's pride of high spirit not to let the bay win .</l>
      <l n="1562">Up he went , past his withers , past his neck , to his head ,</l>
      <l n="1563">With Sir Lopez ’ man lashing , Charles still , seeing red .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="281">
      <l n="1564">So they rushed for one second , then Sir Lopez shot out :</l>
      <l n="1565">Charles thought , “ There , he 's done me , without any doubt .</l>
      <l n="1566">O come now , Right Royal ! ”</l>
      <l n="1567">And Sir Lopez changed feet</l>
      <l n="1568">And his ears went back level ; Sir Lopez was beat .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="282">
      <l n="1569">Right Royal went past him , half an inch , half a head ,</l>
      <l n="1570">Half a neck , he was leading , for an instant he led ;</l>
      <l n="1571">Then a hooped black and coral flew up like a shot ,</l>
      <l n="1572">With a lightning-like effort from little Gavotte .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="283">
      <l n="1573">The little bright mare , made of nerves and steel springs ,</l>
      <l n="1574">Shot level beside him , shot ahead as with wings .</l>
      <l n="1575">Charles felt his horse quicken , felt the desperate beat</l>
      <l n="1576">Of the blood in his body from his knees to his feet .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="284">
      <l n="1577">Three terrible strides brought him up to the mare ,</l>
      <l n="1578">Then they rushed to wild shouting through a whirl of blown air ;</l>
      <l n="1579">Then Gavotte died to nothing ; Soyland came once again</l>
      <l n="1580">Till his muzzle just reached to the knot on his rein .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="285">
      <l n="1581">Then a whirl of urged horses thundered up , whipped and blown ,</l>
      <l n="1582">Soyland , Peterkinooks , and Red Ember the roan .</l>
      <l n="1583">For an instant they challenged , then they drooped and were done ;</l>
      <l n="1584">Then the White Post shot backwards , Right Royal had won .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="286">
      <l n="1585">Won a half length from Soyland , Red Ember close third ;</l>
      <l n="1586">Fourth , Peterkinooks ; fifth , Gavotte harshly spurred ;</l>
      <l n="1587">Sixth , Sir Lopez , whose rider said “ Just at the Straight</l>
      <l n="1588">He swerved at the hurdle and twisted a plate . ”</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="287">
      <l n="1589">Then the numbers went up ; then John Harding appeared</l>
      <l n="1590">To lead in the Winner while the bookmakers cheered .</l>
      <l n="1591">Then the riders weighed-in , and the meeting was over ,</l>
      <l n="1592">And bright Emmy Crowthorne could go with her lover .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="288">
      <l n="1593">For the bets on Right Royal which Cothill had made</l>
      <l n="1594">The taker defaulted , they never were paid ;</l>
      <l n="1595">The taker went West , whence he sent Charles 's bride</l>
      <l n="1596">Silver bit-cups and beadwork on antelope hide .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="289">
      <l n="1597">Charles married his lady , but he rode no more races ;</l>
      <l n="1598">He lives on the Downland on the blown grassy places ,</l>
      <l n="1599">Where he and Right Royal can canter for hours</l>
      <l n="1600">On the flock bitten turf full of tiny blue flowers .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="290">
      <l n="1601">There the Roman pitcht camp , there the Saxon kept sheep ,</l>
      <l n="1602">There he lives out this Living that no man can keep ,</l>
      <l n="1603">That is manful but a moment before it must pass ,</l>
      <l n="1604">Like the stars sweeping westward , like the wind on the grass .</l>
