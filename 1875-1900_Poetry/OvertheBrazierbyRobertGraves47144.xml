    <head>FOREWORD TO NEW EDITION</head>
    <p n="1">When these poems , written between the ages of fourteen and twenty , first appeared , I was serving in France and had no leisure for getting the final proofs altogether as I wanted them . The same year , but too late , I decided on several alterations in the text , including the suppression of two small poems inexcusable even as early work . These amendations appear in this new edition , but I have left the bulk of the book as it stood .</p>

    <head>THE POET IN THE NURSERY</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">The youngest poet down the shelves was fumbling</l>
     <l n="2">In a dim library , just behind the chair</l>
     <l n="3">From which the ancient poet was mum-mumbling</l>
     <l n="4">A song about some Lovers at a Fair ,</l>
     <l n="5">Pulling his long white beard and gently grumbling</l>
     <l n="6">That rhymes were beastly things and never there .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="7">And as I groped , the whole time I was thinking</l>
     <l n="8">About the tragic poem I 'd been writing —</l>
     <l n="9">An old man 's life of beer and whisky drinking ,</l>
     <l n="10">His years of kidnapping and wicked fighting ;</l>
     <l n="11">And how at last , into a fever sinking ,</l>
     <l n="12">Remorsefully he died , his bedclothes biting .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="13">But suddenly I saw the bright green cover</l>
     <l n="14">Of a thin pretty book right down below ;</l>
     <l n="15">I snatched it up and turned the pages over ,</l>
     <l n="16">To find it full of poetry , and so</l>
     <l n="17">Put it down my neck with quick hands like a lover</l>
     <l n="18">And turned to watch if the old man saw it go .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="19">The book was full of funny muddling mazes</l>
     <l n="20">Each rounded off into a lovely song ,</l>
     <l n="21">And most extraordinary and monstrous phrases</l>
     <l n="22">Knotted with rhymes like a slave-driver 's thong ,</l>
     <l n="23">And metre twisting like a chain of daisies</l>
     <l n="24">With great big splendid words a sentence long .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="25">I took the book to bed with me and gloated ,</l>
     <l n="26">Learning the lines that seemed to sound most grand ,</l>
     <l n="27">So soon the pretty emerald green was coated</l>
     <l n="28">With jam and greasy marks from my hot hand ,</l>
     <l n="29">While round the nursery for long months there floated</l>
     <l n="30">Wonderful words no one could understand .</l>

    <head>THE DYING KNIGHT AND THE FAUNS</head>
     <l n="1">Through the dreams of yesternight</l>
     <l n="2">My blood brother great in fight</l>
     <l n="3">I saw lying , slowly dying</l>
     <l n="4">Where the weary woods were sighing</l>
     <l n="5">With the rustle of the birches ,</l>
     <l n="6">With the quiver of the larches ....</l>
     <l n="7">Woodland fauns with hairy haunches</l>
     <l n="8">Grin in wonder through the branches</l>
     <l n="9">Woodland fauns that know no fear .</l>
     <l n="10">Wondering , they wander near</l>
     <l n="11">Munching mushrooms red as coral ,</l>
     <l n="12">Bunches , too , of rue and sorrel ;</l>
     <l n="13">Wonder at his radiant fairness ,</l>
     <l n="14">At his dinted , shattered harness ,</l>
     <l n="15">With uncouth and bestial sounds ,</l>
     <l n="16">Knowing nought of war or wounds :</l>
     <l n="17">But the crimson life-blood oozes</l>
     <l n="18">And make roses of the daisies ,</l>
     <l n="19">Persian carpets of the mosses —</l>
     <l n="20">Softly now his spirit passes</l>
     <l n="21">As the bee forsakes the lily ,</l>
     <l n="22">As the berry leaves the holly ;</l>
     <l n="23">But the fauns still think him living ,</l>
     <l n="24">And with bay leaves they are weaving</l>
     <l n="25">Crowns to deck him . Well they may !</l>
     <l n="26">He was worthy of the Bay .</l>
