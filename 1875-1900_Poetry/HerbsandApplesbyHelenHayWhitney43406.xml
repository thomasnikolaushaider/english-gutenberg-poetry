     <p>“ To the Invincible Republic ” is full of a generous and admiring appreciation . All of these poems are explicit , strong , and interesting .— New York Sun .</p>
     <p>Times — William Watson is , above all things , an artist who is proud of his calling and conscientious in every syllable that he writes . To appreciate his work you must take it as a whole , for he is in line with the high priests of poetry , reared , like Ion , in the shadow of the Delphic presences and memories , and weighing every word of his utterance before it is given to the world .</p>
     <p>Athenaeum — His poetry is a “ criticism of life , ” and , viewed as such , it is magnificent in its lucidity , its elegance , its dignity .... We revere and admire Mr. Watson 's pursuit of a splendid ideal ; and we are sure that his artistic self-mastery will be rewarded by a secure place in the ranks of our poets .... We may express our belief that Mr. Watson will keep his high and honorable station when many showier but shallower reputations have withered away , and must figure in any representative anthology of English poetry .... “ Wordsworth 's Grave ” is , in our judgment , Mr. Watson 's masterpiece ... its music is graver and deeper , its language is purer and clearer , than the frigid droning and fugitive beauties of the “ Elegy in a Country Churchyard . ”</p>
     <p>SABLE AND PURPLE . $ 1. 25 net . Postage 10 cents .</p>
     <p>Boston Transcript — Still the poet whose inspirational fantasy gives distinction to modern English Literature .</p>
     <p>Spectator — A great artist , “ Sable and Purple ” is of a high excellence .</p>

     <p>There is nothing stale or hackneyed in this book ; newness , freshness , and variety are found on every page . These poems are true lyrics , for they give us true glimpses into the hearts of men .</p>
     <p>The Chicago Tribune :</p>
     <p>A volume of passionate love poems written by a true poet .</p>
     <p>The Chicago Inter-Ocean :</p>
     <p>They are in several metres , handled always with graceful ease , and often with intensity . The coloring is vivid and the music subtle . The book is redolent with the atmosphere of the Arabian Nights .</p>
     <p>The Boston Evening Transcript :</p>
     <p>Mr. Hope is a thorough artist to his fingertips , and his choice of words and images is as keen and exact as his ability to adapt Indian literature to the more prosaic mood and tongue of the Anglo-Saxon .</p>
     <p>The Athenaeum :</p>
     <p>Mr. Hope has caught admirably the dominant notes of this Indian love poetry , its delirious absorption in the instant , its out-of-door air , its melancholy .</p>

      <head>STARS OF THE DESERT</head>
      <head>BY LAURENCE HOPE</head>
       <l n="1">The Washington Mirror :</l>
     </lg>
     <p>The author has so completely infused the charm of the Orient into this volume that one is transported for the time and lost in the poetic beauty of his surroundings , finds no jarring chord nor is disposed to shrink from the frankness of this translation of oriental verse .</p>
     <p>The Chicago Tribune :</p>
     <p>It is still a question whether these are direct translations or whether they are written in the Hindu style by Laurence Hope . Perhaps she has done for the Hindu poets what FitzGerald did for Omar .</p>
     <p>The Conservator :</p>
     <p>He seems to exhale an oriental atmosphere . He sings musically . I can follow the delicate strain by which Hope saves himself from stepping beyond the bounds of a vital reserve .</p>
     <p>The New York Star :</p>
     <p>The author is imbued with the glowing passion of Eastern romance .</p>
     <p>The New York Globe :</p>
     <p>The theme , in almost every instance love , is treated with feverish abandon .</p>

     <p>The English speaking world has waited a thousand years for a worthy dramatic impersonation of King Alfred . And here it is .... The play will stand not alone upon the grateful response it wins from the English national heart , but as a work of art .... The author is supremely a poet , the master of metaphor not less than of melody .... It is a play not only to be read but to be acted .... This vivid drama is not cast in the conventional classic mould . It is distinctly and wholly English in spirit and form , and intensely modern — but breathing the air of morning , of springtime , of fresh adventure .— HENRY MILLS ALDEN , The New York Times Saturday Review .</p>
     <p>King Alfred 's noble and vigorous character is limned with great skill , while Elfreda , a graceful and innocent maiden , flits through the play like a woodland fairy .— The Glasgow Evening News , Scotland .</p>
     <p>The living Alfred lives in this gracious play , for the author has fashioned his great spirit out of the mist of time .— JAMES DOUGLAS , The Star , London .</p>

Athenaeum — There is urgent need for a collected edition of Mr. Davidson 's poems and plays . The volume and variety of his poetry ought to win for it wider acceptance . It is indeed curious that poetry so splendid as Mr. Davidson 's should fail to get fuller recognition . There are many aspects of his genius which ought to make his work popular in the best sense of the word . He has almost invented the modern ballad .... He handles the metre with masterly skill , filling it with imaginative life and power . Times — There are not more than two or three living writers of English verse out of whose poems so good a selection could be made . The poems in the selection are not only positive — they are visible . Literary World — We count ourselves among those to whom Mr. Davidson has made himself indispensable .
