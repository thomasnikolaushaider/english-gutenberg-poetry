    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="158">I have been so great a lover : filled my days</l>
     <l n="159">So proudly with the splendour of Love 's praise ,</l>
     <l n="160">The pain , the calm , and the astonishment ,</l>
     <l n="161">Desire illimitable , and still content ,</l>
     <l n="162">And all dear names men use , to cheat despair ,</l>
     <l n="163">For the perplexed and viewless streams that bear</l>
     <l n="164">Our hearts at random down the dark of life .</l>
     <l n="165">Now , ere the unthinking silence on that strife</l>
     <l n="166">Steals down , I would cheat drowsy Death so far ,</l>
     <l n="167">My night shall be remembered for a star</l>
     <l n="168">That outshone all the suns of all men 's days .</l>
     <l n="169">Shall I not crown them with immortal praise</l>
     <l n="170">Whom I have loved , who have given me , dared with me</l>
     <l n="171">High secrets , and in darkness knelt to see</l>
     <l n="172">The inenarrable godhead of delight ?</l>
     <l n="173">Love is a flame :— we have beaconed the world 's night .</l>
     <l n="174">A city :— and we have built it , these and I .</l>
     <l n="175">An emperor :— we have taught the world to die .</l>
     <l n="176">So , for their sakes I loved , ere I go hence ,</l>
     <l n="177">And the high cause of Love 's magnificence ,</l>
     <l n="178">And to keep loyalties young , I 'll write those names</l>
     <l n="179">Golden for ever , eagles , crying flames ,</l>
     <l n="180">And set them as a banner , that men may know ,</l>
     <l n="181">To dare the generations , burn , and blow</l>
     <l n="182">Out on the wind of Time , shining and streaming ..</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="183">These I have loved :</l>
     <l n="184">White plates and cups , clean-gleaming ,</l>
     <l n="185">Ringed with blue lines ; and feathery , faery dust ;</l>
     <l n="186">Wet roofs , beneath the lamplight ; the strong crust</l>
     <l n="187">Of friendly bread ; and many-tasting food ;</l>
     <l n="188">Rainbows ; and the blue bitter smoke of wood ;</l>
     <l n="189">And radiant raindrops couching in cool flowers ;</l>
     <l n="190">And flowers themselves , that sway through sunny hours ,</l>
     <l n="191">Dreaming of moths that drink them under the moon ;</l>
     <l n="192">Then , the cool kindliness of sheets , that soon</l>
     <l n="193">Smooth away trouble ; and the rough male kiss</l>
     <l n="194">Of blankets ; grainy wood ; live hair that is</l>
     <l n="195">Shining and free ; blue-massing clouds ; the keen</l>
     <l n="196">Unpassioned beauty of a great machine ;</l>
     <l n="197">The benison of hot water ; furs to touch ;</l>
     <l n="198">The good smell of old clothes ; and other such ,</l>
     <l n="199">The comfortable smell of friendly fingers ,</l>
     <l n="200">Hair 's fragrance , and the musty reek that lingers</l>
     <l n="201">About dead leaves and last year 's ferns ....</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="202">Dear names ,</l>
     <l n="203">And thousand other throng to me ! Royal flames ;</l>
     <l n="204">Sweet water 's dimpling laugh from tap or spring ;</l>
     <l n="205">Holes in the ground ; and voices that do sing ;</l>
     <l n="206">Voices in laughter , too ; and body 's pain ,</l>
     <l n="207">Soon turned to peace ; and the deep-panting train ;</l>
     <l n="208">Firm sands ; the little dulling edge of foam</l>
     <l n="209">That browns and dwindles as the wave goes home ;</l>
     <l n="210">And washen stones , gay for an hour ; the cold</l>
     <l n="211">Graveness of iron ; moist black earthen mould ;</l>
     <l n="212">Sleep ; and high places ; footprints in the dew ;</l>
     <l n="213">And oaks ; and brown horse-chestnuts , glossy-new ;</l>
     <l n="214">And new-peeled sticks ; and shining pools on grass ;</l>
     <l n="215">All these have been my loves . And these shall pass ,</l>
     <l n="216">Whatever passes not , in the great hour ,</l>
     <l n="217">Nor all my passion , all my prayers , have power</l>
     <l n="218">To hold them with me through the gate of Death .</l>
     <l n="219">They 'll play deserter , turn with the traitor breath ,</l>
     <l n="220">Break the high bond we made , and sell Love 's trust</l>
     <l n="221">And sacramented covenant to the dust .</l>
     <l n="222">—— Oh , never a doubt but , somewhere , I shall wake ,</l>
     <l n="223">And give what 's left of love again , and make</l>
     <l n="224">New friends , now strangers ....</l>
     <l n="225">But the best I 've known ,</l>
     <l n="226">Stays here , and changes , breaks , grows old , is blown</l>
     <l n="227">About the winds of the world , and fades from brains</l>
     <l n="228">Of living men , and dies .</l>
     <l n="229">Nothing remains .</l>
     <l n="230">O dear my loves , O faithless , once again</l>
     <l n="231">This one last gift I give : that after men</l>
     <l n="232">Shall know , and later lovers , far-removed ,</l>
     <l n="233">Praise you , “ All these were lovely ” ; say , “ He loved . ”</l>

   <p>Twenty-eighth Impression 3s . 6d . net</p>
   <p>“ The volume of ‘ Poems ’ published in 1911 , which contains work written as early as 1905 , when he was eighteen , shows an art curiously personal , skilful , deliberate . It shows , too , an intellectual deftness altogether unexpected in so young a poet , and it shows finally , not always but often , an indifference to the normal material upon which poets good and bad are apt to work from the outset , and in the shaping of which ultimately comes all poetry that is memorable . Nearly every page is interesting on account of its art and intellectual deftness , qualities that we should not expect to be marked ....</p>
   <p>“ ... Even in the poems where most we feel the lack of emotional truth there is a beauty of word that made the book full of the most exciting promise . Already , too there was in certain poems assurance against the danger that this intellectual constraint might degenerate into virtuosity . ” — From “ RUPERT BROOKE , ” by John Drinkwater , in the Contemporary Review , December 1915 .</p>
   <p>*** The poems on pp . 7-38 of Selected Poems are taken from the above volume .</p>

   <p>Twenty-eighth Impression 3s . 6d . net</p>
   <p>“ To those of us who see in poetry the perfect flowering of life , the story of Rupert Brooke will always mean chiefly the score or so of poems in which he reached to the full maturity of his genius and gave imperishable expression to the very heart of his personality .... Not even the fact that the man who wrote the sonnets , than which after long generations nothing shall make the year 1914 more memorable , served and died for England at war , can add one beat to their pulse . The poetry that shines and falls across them in one perfect and complete wave is , as poetry must always be , independent of all factual experience , and comes wholly from the deeper experience of the imagination . ” — From “ RUPERT BROOKE ” by John Drinkwater , in the Contemporary Review . December 1915 .</p>
