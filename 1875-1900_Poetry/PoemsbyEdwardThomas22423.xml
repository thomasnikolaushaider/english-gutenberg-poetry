      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">THE dim sea glints chill . The white sun is shy .</l>
       <l n="2">And the skeleton weeds and the never-dry ,</l>
       <l n="3">Rough , long grasses keep white with frost</l>
       <l n="4">At the hilltop by the finger-post ;</l>
       <l n="5">The smoke of the traveller'shYpppHeNjoy is puffed</l>
       <l n="6">Over hawthorn berry and hazel tuft .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="7">I read the sign . Which way shall I go ?</l>
       <l n="8">A voice says : You would not have doubted so</l>
       <l n="9">At twenty . Another voice gentle with scorn</l>
       <l n="10">Says : At twenty you wished you had never been born .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="11">One hazel lost a leaf of gold</l>
       <l n="12">From a tuft at the tip , when the first voice told</l>
       <l n="13">The other he wished to know what ‘ twould be</l>
       <l n="14">To be sixty by this same post . “ You shall see , ”</l>
       <l n="15">He laughed — and I had to join his laughter —</l>
       <l n="16">“ You shall see ; but either before or after ,</l>
       <l n="17">Whatever happens , it must befall ,</l>
       <l n="18">A mouthful of earth to remedy all</l>
       <l n="19">Regrets and wishes shall freely be given ;</l>
       <l n="20">And if there be a flaw in that heaven</l>

       <l n="24">At any age between death and birth ,—</l>
       <l n="25">To see what day or night can be ,</l>
       <l n="26">The sun and the frost , the land and the sea ,</l>
       <l n="27">Summer , Autumn , Winter , Spring ,—</l>
       <l n="28">With a poor man of any sort , down to a king ,</l>
       <l n="29">Standing upright out in the air</l>
       <l n="30">Wondering where he shall journey , O where ? ”</l>

      <head>TEARS</head>
       <l n="1">IT seems I have no tears left . They should have fallen —</l>
       <l n="2">Their ghosts , if tears have ghosts , did fall — that day</l>
       <l n="3">When twenty hounds streamed by me , not yet combed</l>
       <l n="4">out</l>
       <l n="5">But still all equals in their rage of gladness</l>
       <l n="6">Upon the scent , made one , like a great dragon</l>
       <l n="7">In Blooming Meadow that bends towards the sun</l>
       <l n="8">And once bore hops : and on that other day</l>
       <l n="9">When I stepped out from the double-shadowed Tower</l>
       <l n="10">Into an April morning , stirring and sweet</l>
       <l n="11">And warm . Strange solitude was there and silence .</l>
       <l n="12">A mightier charm than any in the Tower</l>
       <l n="13">Possessed the courtyard . They were changing guard</l>
       <l n="14">Soldiers in line , young English countrymen ,</l>
       <l n="15">Fair-haired and ruddy , in white tunics . Drums</l>
       <l n="16">And fifes were playing “ The British Grenadiers ” .</l>
       <l n="17">The men , the music piercing that solitude</l>
       <l n="18">And silence , told me truths I had not dreamed</l>
       <l n="19">And have forgotten since their beauty passed .</l>

      <head>TWO PEWITS</head>
       <l n="1">UNDER the after-sunset sky</l>
       <l n="2">Two pewits sport and cry ,</l>
       <l n="3">More white than is the moon on high</l>
       <l n="4">Riding the dark surge silently ;</l>
       <l n="5">More black than earth . Their cry</l>
       <l n="6">Is the one sound under the sky .</l>
       <l n="7">They alone move , now low , now high ,</l>
       <l n="8">And merrily they cry</l>
       <l n="9">To the mischievous Spring sky ,</l>
       <l n="10">Plunging earthward , tossing high ,</l>
       <l n="11">Over the ghost who wonders why</l>
       <l n="12">So merrily they cry and fly ,</l>
       <l n="13">Nor choose ‘ twixt earth and sky ,</l>
       <l n="14">While the moon 's quarter silently</l>
       <l n="15">Rides , and earth rests as silently .</l>

      <head>THE MANOR FARM</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">THE rock-like mud unfroze a little and rills</l>
       <l n="2">Ran and sparkled down each side of the road</l>
       <l n="3">Under the catkins wagging in the hedge .</l>
       <l n="4">But earth would have her sleep out , spite of the sun ;</l>
       <l n="5">Nor did I value that thin gilding beam</l>
       <l n="6">More than a pretty February thing</l>
       <l n="7">Till I came down to the old Manor Farm ,</l>
       <l n="8">And church and yew-tree opposite , in age</l>
       <l n="9">Its equals and in size . The church and yew</l>
       <l n="10">And farmhouse slept in a Sunday silentness .</l>
       <l n="11">The air raised not a straw . The steep farm roof ,</l>
       <l n="12">With tiles duskily glowing , entertained</l>
       <l n="13">The mid-day sun ; and up and down the roof</l>
       <l n="14">White pigeons nestled . There was no sound but one .</l>
       <l n="15">Three cart-horses were looking over a gate</l>
       <l n="16">Drowsily through their forelocks , swishing their tails</l>
       <l n="17">Against a fly , a solitary fly .</l>

       <l n="18">The Winter 's cheek flushed as if he had drained</l>
       <l n="19">Spring , Summer , and Autumn at a draught</l>
       <l n="20">And smiled quietly . But ‘ twas not Winter —</l>
       <l n="21">Rather a season of bliss unchangeable</l>
       <l n="22">Awakened from farm and church where it had lain</l>
       <l n="23">Safe under tile and thatch for ages since</l>
       <l n="24">This England , Old already , was called Merry .</l>

      <head>AS THE TEAM 'S HEAD-BRASS</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">As the team 's head-brass flashed out on the turn</l>
       <l n="2">The lovers disappeared into the wood .</l>
       <l n="3">I sat among the boughs of the fallen elm</l>
       <l n="4">That strewed an angle of the fallow , and</l>
       <l n="5">Watched the plough narrowing a yellow square</l>
       <l n="6">Of charlock . Every time the horses turned</l>
       <l n="7">Instead of treading me down , the ploughman leaned</l>
       <l n="8">Upon the handles to say or ask a word ,</l>
       <l n="9">About the weather , next about the war .</l>
       <l n="10">Scraping the share he faced towards the wood ,</l>
       <l n="11">And screwed along the furrow till the brass flashed</l>
       <l n="12">Once more .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="13">The blizzard felled the elm whose crest</l>
       <l n="14">I sat in , by a woodpecker 's round hole ,</l>
       <l n="15">The ploughman said . “ When will they take it away ? ”</l>
       <l n="16">“ When the war 's over . ” So the talk began —</l>
       <l n="17">One minute and an interval of ten ,</l>
       <l n="18">A minute more and the same interval .</l>

      <head>HAYMAKING</head>
       <l n="1">AFTER night 's thunder far away had rolled</l>
       <l n="2">The fiery day had a kernel sweet of cold ,</l>
       <l n="3">And in the perfect blue the clouds uncurled ,</l>
       <l n="4">Like the first gods before they made the world</l>
       <l n="5">And misery , swimming the stormless sea</l>
       <l n="6">In beauty and in divine gaiety .</l>
       <l n="7">The smooth white empty road was lightly strewn</l>
       <l n="8">With leaves — the holly 's Autumn falls in June —</l>
       <l n="9">And fir cones standing stiff up in the heat .</l>
       <l n="10">The mill-foot water tumbled white and lit</l>
       <l n="11">With tossing crystals , happier than any crowd</l>
       <l n="12">Of children pouring out of school aloud .</l>
       <l n="13">And in the little thickets where a sleeper</l>
       <l n="14">For ever might lie lost , the nettle-creeper</l>
       <l n="15">And garden warbler sang unceasingly ;</l>
       <l n="16">While over them shrill shrieked in his fierce glee</l>
       <l n="17">The swift with wings and tail as sharp and narrow</l>
       <l n="18">As if the bow had flown off with the arrow .</l>
       <l n="19">Only the scent of woodbine and hay new-mown</l>
       <l n="20">Travelled the road . In the field sloping down ,</l>
       <l n="21">Park-like , to where its willows showed the brook ,</l>
       <l n="22">Haymakers rested . The tosser lay forsook</l>
       <l n="23">Out in the sun ; and the long waggon stood</l>
       <l n="24">Without its team , it seemed it never would</l>
       <l n="25">Move from the shadow of that single yew .</l>
       <l n="26">The team , as still , until their task was due ,</l>
       <l n="27">Beside the labourers enjoyed the shade</l>
       <l n="28">That three squat oaks mid-field together made</l>
       <l n="29">Upon a circle of grass and weed uncut ,</l>
       <l n="30">And on the hollow , once a chalk-pit , but</l>
       <l n="31">Now brimmed with nut and elder-flower so clean .</l>
       <l n="32">The men leaned on their rakes , about to begin ,</l>
       <l n="33">But still . And all were silent . All was old ,</l>
       <l n="34">This morning time , with a great age untold ,</l>
       <l n="35">Older than Clare and Cobbett , Morland and Crome ,</l>
       <l n="36">Than , at the field 's far edge , the farmer 's home ,</l>
       <l n="37">A white house crouched at the foot of a great tree .</l>
       <l n="38">Under the heavens that know not what years be</l>
       <l n="39">The men , the beasts , the trees , the implements</l>
       <l n="40">Uttered even what they will in times far hence —</l>
       <l n="41">All of us gone out of the reach of change —</l>
       <l n="42">Immortal in a picture of an old grange .</l>

       <l n="10">Solitary , listening to the rain ,</l>
       <l n="11">Either in pain or thus in sympathy</l>
       <l n="12">Helpless among the living and the dead ,</l>
       <l n="13">Like a cold water among broken reeds ,</l>
       <l n="14">Myriads of broken reeds all still and stiff ,</l>
       <l n="15">Like me who have no love which this wild rain</l>
