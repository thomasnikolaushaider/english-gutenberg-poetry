    <docImprint><settlement>LONDON</settlement>MARTIN SECKER XVII BUCKINGHAM STREET ADELPHI<settlement>LONDON</settlement>: MARTIN SECKER ( LTD )<date>1918</date>DEDICATION Lord , I have seen at harvest festival In a white lamp-lit fishing-village church , How the poor folk , lacking fine decorations , Offer the first-fruits of their various toils : Not only fruit and blossom of the fields , Ripe corn and poppies , scabious , marguerites , Melons and marrows , carrots and potatoes , And pale round turnips and sweet cottage flowers , But gifts of other produce , heaped brown nets , Fine pollack , silver fish with umber backs , And handsome green-dark-blue-striped mackerel , And uglier , hornier creatures from the sea , Lobsters , long-clawed and eyed , and smooth flat crabs , Ranged with the flowers upon the window-niches , To lie in that symbolic contiguity While lusty hymns of gratitude ascend . So I Here offer all I have found : A few bright stainless flowers And richer , earthlier blooms , and homely grain , And roots that grew distorted in the dark , And shapes of livid hue and sprawling form Dragged from the deepest maters I have searched . Most diverse gifts , yet all alike in this : They are all the natural products of my mind And heart and senses ; And all with labour grown , or plucked , or caught .</docImprint>

    <head>PREFACE</head>
    <p n="1">The title of this book was chosen for this reason . Had the volume been called —— and Other Poems it might have given a false impression that its contents were entirely new . Had it been called Collected Poems the equally false impression might have been given that there was something of finality about it . The title selected seemed best to convey both the fact that it was a collection and that , under Providence , other ( and , let us hope , superior ) collections will follow it .</p>
    <p n="2">The book contains all that I do not wish to destroy of the contents of four volumes of verse . A number of small corrections have been made . There are added , also , a few recent poems not previously published . The earliest of the poems now reprinted is dated 1905 , in which year I was twenty-one . Some of the subsequent years , such as 1914 and 1915 , contributed nothing to this book : the greater number of the poems were written in 1911-1912 and 1916-1917 .</p>
    <p n="3">Some of the poems were not written as I should now write them ; and many of them reflect transient , though mostly recurrent , moods which I do not necessarily think worthy of esteem .</p>
    <p n="4">J. C. S .</p>
    <p n="5">March 1918 .</p>

      <head>THE ROOF</head>
      <lg type="part" n="1">
       <head>I</head>
       <lg type="stanza" n="1">
        <l n="1">When the clouds hide the sun away</l>
        <l n="2">The tall slate roof is dull and grey ,</l>
        <l n="3">And when the rain adown it streams</l>
        <l n="4">‘ Tis polished lead with pale-blue gleams .</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="2">
        <l n="5">When the clouds vanish and the rain</l>
        <l n="6">Stops , and the sun comes out again ,</l>
        <l n="7">It shimmers golden in the sun</l>
        <l n="8">Almost too bright to look upon .</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="3">
        <l n="9">But soon beneath the steady rays</l>
        <l n="10">The roof is dried and reft of blaze ,</l>
        <l n="11">‘ Tis dusty yellow traversed through</l>
        <l n="12">By long thin lines of deepest blue .</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="4">
        <l n="13">Then at the last , as night draws near ,</l>
        <l n="14">The lines grow faint and disappear ,</l>
        <l n="15">The roof becomes a purple mist ,</l>
        <l n="16">A great square darkening amethyst</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="5">
        <l n="17">Which sinks into the gathering shade</l>
        <l n="18">Till separate form and colour fade ,</l>
        <l n="19">And it is but a patch which mars</l>
        <l n="20">The beauty of a field of stars .</l>

       <lg type="stanza" n="6">
        <l n="21">It stands so lonely in the sky</l>
        <l n="22">The sparrows never come thereby ,</l>
        <l n="23">The glossy starlings seldom stop</l>
        <l n="24">To preen and chatter on the top .</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="7">
        <l n="25">For a whole week sometimes up there</l>
        <l n="26">No wing-wave stirs the quiet air ,</l>
        <l n="27">The roof lies silent and serene</l>
        <l n="28">As though no life had ever been ;</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="8">
        <l n="29">Till some bright afternoon , athwart</l>
        <l n="30">The edge two sudden shadows dart ,</l>
        <l n="31">And two white pigeons with pink feet</l>
        <l n="32">Flutter above and pitch on it .</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="9">
        <l n="33">Jerking their necks out as they walk</l>
        <l n="34">They talk awhile their pigeon-talk ,</l>
        <l n="35">A low continuous murmur blent</l>
        <l n="36">Of mock reproaches and content .</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="10">
        <l n="37">Then cease , and sit there warm and white</l>
        <l n="38">An hour , till in the fading light</l>
        <l n="39">They wake , and know the close of day ,</l>
        <l n="40">Flutter above , and fly away ,</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="11">
        <l n="41">Leaving the roof whereon they sat</l>
        <l n="42">As ‘ twas before , a peaceful flat</l>
        <l n="43">Expanse , as silent and serene</l>
        <l n="44">As though no life had ever been .</l>

      <head>TOWN</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">Mostly in a dull rotation</l>
       <l n="2">We bear our loads and eat and drink and sleep .</l>
       <l n="3">Feeling no tears , knowing no meditation —</l>
       <l n="4">Too tired to think , too clogged with earth to weep .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="5">Dimly convinced , poor groping wretches ,</l>
       <l n="6">Like eyeless insects in a murky pond</l>
       <l n="7">That out and out this city stretches ,</l>
       <l n="8">Away , away , and there is no beyond .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="9">No larger earth , no loftier heaven ,</l>
       <l n="10">No cleaner , gentler airs to breathe . And yet ,</l>
       <l n="11">Even to us sometimes is given</l>
       <l n="12">Visions of things we other times forget .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="13">Some day is done , its labour ended ,</l>
       <l n="14">And as we sit and brood at windows high ,</l>
       <l n="15">A steady wind from far descended ,</l>
       <l n="16">Blows off the filth that hid the deeper sky ;</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="17">There are the empty waiting spaces ,</l>
       <l n="18">We watch , we watch , unwinking , pale and dumb ,</l>
       <l n="19">Till gliding up with noiseless paces ,</l>
       <l n="20">Night covers all the wide arch : Night has come .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="21">Not that sick false night of the city ,</l>
       <l n="22">Lurid and low and yellow and obscene ,</l>
       <l n="23">But mother Night , pure , full of pity ,</l>
       <l n="24">The star-strewn Night , blue , potent and serene .</l>

       <l n="25">O , as we gaze the clamour ceases ,</l>
       <l n="26">The turbid world around grows dim and small ,</l>
       <l n="27">The soft-shed influence releases</l>
       <l n="28">Our shrouded spirits from their dusty pall .</l>
      </lg>

       <l n="29">No more we hear the turbulent traffic ,</l>
       <l n="30">Not scorned but unremembered is the day ;</l>
       <l n="31">The Night , all luminous and seraphic ,</l>
       <l n="32">Has brushed its heavy memories away .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="9">
       <l n="33">The great blue Night so clear and kindly ,</l>
       <l n="34">The little stars so wide-eyed and so still ,</l>
       <l n="35">Open a door for souls that blindly</l>
       <l n="36">Had wandered , tunnelling the endless hill ;</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="10">
       <l n="37">They draw the long-untraversed portal ,</l>

       <l n="39">The immortal feels for the immortal ,</l>

       <l n="41">Impalpably we are led and lifted ,</l>
       <l n="42">Softly we shake into the gulf of blue ,</l>
       <l n="43">The last environing veil is rifted</l>
       <l n="44">And lost horizons float into our view .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="12">
       <l n="45">Lost lands , lone seas , lands that afar gleam</l>
       <l n="46">With a miraculous beauty , faint yet clear ,</l>
       <l n="47">Forgotten lands of night and star-gleam ,</l>

       <l n="49">Borne without effort or endeavour ,</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="14">
       <l n="53">Now fleets below a tranced moorland ,</l>
       <l n="54">A sweep of glimmering immobility ;</l>

     <p>The dead man 's gone , the live man 's sad , the dying leaf shakes on the tree , The wind constrains the window-panes and moans like moaning of the sea , And sour 's the taste now culled in haste of lovely things I won too late , And loud and loud above the crowd the Voice of One more strong than we .</p>

      <head>THE MARCH</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">I heard a voice that cried , “ Make way for those who died ! ”</l>
       <l n="2">And all the coloured crowd like ghosts at morning fled ;</l>
       <l n="3">And down the waiting road , rank after rank there strode ,</l>
       <l n="4">In mute and measured march a hundred thousand dead .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="5">A hundred thousand dead , with firm and noiseless tread ,</l>
       <l n="6">All shadowy-grey yet solid , with faces grey and ghast ,</l>
       <l n="7">And by the house they went , and all their brows were bent</l>
       <l n="8">Straight forward ; and they passed , and passed , and passed , and passed .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="9">But O there came a place , and O there came a face ,</l>
       <l n="10">That clenched my heart to see it , and sudden turned my way ;</l>
       <l n="11">And in the Face that turned I saw two eyes that burned ,</l>
       <l n="12">Never-forgotten eyes , and they had things to say .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="13">Like desolate stars they shone one moment , and were gone ,</l>
       <l n="14">And I sank down and put my arms across my head ,</l>
       <l n="15">And felt them moving past , nor looked to see the last ,</l>
       <l n="16">In steady silent march , our hundred thousand dead .</l>

     <head>PROLOGUE : IN DARKNESS</head>
     <p>With my sleeping beloved huddled tranquil beside me , why do I lie awake , Listening to the loud clock 's hurry in the darkness , and feeling my heart 's fierce ache That beats one response to the brain 's many questionings , and in solitude bears the weight Of all the world 's evil and misery and frustration , and the senseless pressure of fate ?</p>
     <p>Is it season of ploughing and sowing , this long vigil , that so certainly it recurs ? In this unsought return of a pain that was ended , is it here that a song first stirs ? Can it be that from this , when to-night 's gone from memory , there will spring of a sudden , some time , Like a silver lily breaking from black deadly waters , the thin-blown shape of a rhyme ?</p>

      <head>THE LILY OF MALUD</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">The lily of Malud is born in secret mud .</l>
       <l n="2">It is breathed like a word in a little dark ravine</l>
       <l n="3">Where no bird was ever heard and no beast was ever seen ,</l>
       <l n="4">And the leaves are never stirred by the panther 's velvet sheen .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="5">It blooms once a year in summer moonlight ,</l>
       <l n="6">In a valley of dark fear full of pale moonlight :</l>
       <l n="7">It blooms once a year , and dies in a night ,</l>
       <l n="8">And its petals disappear with the dawn 's first light ;</l>
       <l n="9">And when that night has come , black small-breasted maids ,</l>
       <l n="10">With ecstatic terror dumb , steal fawn-like through the shades</l>
       <l n="11">To watch , hour by hour , the unfolding of the flower .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="12">When the world is full of night , and the moon reigns alone</l>
       <l n="13">And drowns in silver light the known and the unknown ,</l>
       <l n="14">When each hut is a mound , half blue silver and half black ,</l>
       <l n="15">And casts upon the ground the hard shadow of its back ,</l>
       <l n="16">When the winds are out of hearing and the tree-tops never shake ,</l>
       <l n="17">When the grass in the clearing is silent but awake</l>
       <l n="18">‘ Neath a moon-paven sky : all the village is asleep</l>
       <l n="19">And the babes that nightly cry dream deep :</l>
       <l n="20">From the doors the maidens creep ,</l>
       <l n="21">Tiptoe over dreaming curs , soft , so soft , that not one stirs ,</l>
       <l n="22">And stand curved and a-quiver , like bathers by a river ,</l>
       <l n="23">Looking at the forest wall , groups of slender naked girls ,</l>
       <l n="24">Whose black bodies shine like pearls where the moonbeams fall .</l>
       <l n="25">They have waked , they knew not why , at a summons from the night ,</l>
       <l n="26">They have stolen fearfully from the dark to the light ,</l>
       <l n="27">Stepping over sleeping men , who have moved and slept again :</l>
       <l n="28">And they know not why they go to the forest , but they know ,</l>
       <l n="29">As their moth-feet pass to the shore of the grass</l>
       <l n="30">And the forest 's dreadful brink , that their tender spirits shrink :</l>
       <l n="31">They would flee , but cannot turn , for their eyelids burn</l>
       <l n="32">With frenzy , and each maid , ere she leaves the moonlit space ,</l>
       <l n="33">If she sees another 's face is thrilled and afraid .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="34">Now like little phantom fawns they thread the outer lawns</l>
       <l n="35">Where the boles of giant trees stand about in twos and threes ,</l>
       <l n="36">Till the forest grows more dense and the darkness more intense ,</l>
       <l n="37">And they only sometimes see in a lone moon-ray</l>
       <l n="38">A dead and spongy trunk in the earth half-sunk ,</l>
       <l n="39">Or the roots of a tree with fungus grey ,</l>
       <l n="40">Or a drift of muddy leaves , or a banded snake that heaves .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="41">And the towering unseen roof grows more intricate , and soon</l>
       <l n="42">It is featureless and proof to the lost forgotten moon .</l>
       <l n="43">But they could not look above as with blind-drawn feet they move</l>
       <l n="44">Onwards on the scarce-felt path , with quick and desperate breath ,</l>
       <l n="45">For their circling fingers dread to caress some slimy head ,</l>
       <l n="46">Or to touch the icy shape of a hunched and hairy ape ,</l>
       <l n="47">And at every step they fear in their very midst to hear</l>
       <l n="48">A lion 's rending roar or a tiger 's snore ....</l>
       <l n="49">And when things swish or fall , they shiver but dare not call .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="50">O what is it leads the way that they do not stray ?</l>
       <l n="51">What unimagined arm keeps their bodies from harm ?</l>
       <l n="52">What presence concealed lifts their little feet that yield</l>
       <l n="53">Over dry ground and wet till their straining eyes are met</l>
       <l n="54">With a thinning of the darkness ?</l>
       <l n="55">And the foremost faintly cries in awed surprise :</l>
       <l n="56">And they one by one emerge from the gloom to the verge</l>
       <l n="57">Of a small sunken vale full of moonlight pale .</l>
       <l n="58">And they hang along the bank , clinging to the branches dank ,</l>
       <l n="59">A shadowy festoon out of sight of the moon ;</l>
       <l n="60">And they see in front of them , rising from the mud</l>
       <l n="61">A single straight stem and a single pallid bud</l>
       <l n="62">In that little lake of light from the moon 's calm height .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="63">A stem , a ghostly bud , on the moon-swept mud</l>
       <l n="64">That shimmers like a pond ; and over there beyond</l>
       <l n="65">The guardian forest high , menacing and strange ,</l>
       <l n="66">Invades the empty sky with its wild black range .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="67">And they watch hour by hour that small lonely flower</l>
       <l n="68">In that deep forest place that hunter never found .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="9">
       <l n="69">It shines without sound , as a star in space .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="10">
       <l n="70">And the silence all around that solitary place</l>
       <l n="71">Is like silence in a dream ; till a sudden flashing gleam</l>
       <l n="72">Down their dark faces flies ; and their lips fall apart</l>
       <l n="73">And their glimmering great eyes with excitement dart</l>
       <l n="74">And their fingers , clutching the branches they were touching ,</l>
       <l n="75">Shake and arouse hissing leaves on the boughs .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="11">
       <l n="76">And they whisper aswoon : Did it move in the moon ?</l>
       <l n="77">O it moved as it grew !</l>
       <l n="78">It is moving , opening , with calm and gradual will ,</l>
       <l n="79">And their bodies where they cling are shadowed and still</l>
       <l n="80">And with marvel they mark that the mud now is dark</l>
       <l n="81">For the unfolding flower , like a goddess in her power ,</l>
       <l n="82">Challenges the moon with a light of her own ,</l>
       <l n="83">That lovelily grows as the petals unclose ,</l>
       <l n="84">Wider , more wide with an awful inward pride ,</l>
       <l n="85">Till the heart of it breaks , and stilled is their breath ,</l>
       <l n="86">For the radiance it makes is as wonderful as death .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="12">
       <l n="87">The morning 's crimson stain tinges their ashen brows</l>
       <l n="88">As they part the last boughs and slowly step again</l>
       <l n="89">On to the village grass , and chill and languid pass</l>
       <l n="90">Into the huts to sleep .</l>
       <l n="91">Brief slumber , yet so deep</l>
       <l n="92">That , when they wake to day , darkness and splendour seem</l>
       <l n="93">Broken and far away , a faint miraculous dream ;</l>
       <l n="94">And when those maidens rise they are as they ever were</l>
       <l n="95">Save only for a rare shade of trouble in their eyes .</l>
       <l n="96">And the surly thick-lipped men , as they sit about their huts</l>
       <l n="97">Making drums out of guts , grunting gruffly now and then ,</l>
       <l n="98">Carving sticks of ivory , stretching shields of wrinkled skin ,</l>
       <l n="99">Smoothing sinister and thin squatting gods of ebony ,</l>
       <l n="100">Chip and grunt and do not see .</l>
       <l n="101">But each mother , silently ,</l>
       <l n="102">Longer than her wont stays shut in the dimness of her hut ,</l>
       <l n="103">For she feels a brooding cloud of memory in the air ,</l>
       <l n="104">A lingering thing there that makes her sit bowed</l>
       <l n="105">With hollow shining eyes , as the night-fire dies ,</l>
       <l n="106">And stare softly at the ember , and try to remember</l>
       <l n="107">Something sorrowful and far , something sweet and vaguely seen</l>
       <l n="108">Like an early evening star when the sky is pale green :</l>
       <l n="109">A quiet silver tower that climbed in an hour ,</l>
       <l n="110">Or a ghost like a flower , or a flower like a queen :</l>
       <l n="111">Something holy in the past that came and did not last .</l>

       <l n="2">We sha'n ' t see Willy any more , Mamie ,</l>
       <l n="3">He wo n't be coming any more :</l>
       <l n="4">He came back once and again and again ,</l>
       <l n="5">But he wo n't get leave any more .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="6">We looked from the window and there was his cab ,</l>
       <l n="7">And we ran downstairs like a streak ,</l>
       <l n="8">And he said “ Hullo , you bad dog , ” and you crouched to the floor ,</l>
       <l n="9">Paralysed to hear him speak ,</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="10">And then let fly at his face and his chest</l>
       <l n="11">Till I had to hold you down ,</l>
       <l n="12">While he took off his cap and his gloves and his coat .</l>
       <l n="13">And his bag and his thonged Sam Browne .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="14">We went upstairs to the studio ,</l>
       <l n="15">The three of us , just as of old ,</l>
       <l n="16">And you lay down and I sat and talked to him</l>
       <l n="17">As round the room he strolled .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="18">Here in the room where , years ago</l>
       <l n="19">Before the old life stopped ,</l>
       <l n="20">He worked all day with his slippers and his pipe ,</l>
       <l n="21">He would pick up the threads he 'd dropped ,</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="22">Fondling all the drawings he had left behind ,</l>
       <l n="23">Glad to find them all still the same ,</l>
       <l n="24">And opening the cupboards to look at his belongings</l>
       <l n="25">... Every time he came .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="26">But now I know what a dog does n't know ,</l>
       <l n="27">Though you 'll thrust your head on my knee ,</l>
       <l n="28">And try to draw me from the absent-mindedness</l>
       <l n="29">That you find so dull in me .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="9">
       <l n="30">And all your life you will never know</l>
       <l n="31">What I would n't tell you even if I could ,</l>
       <l n="32">That the last time we waved him away</l>
       <l n="33">Willy went for good .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="10">
       <l n="34">But sometimes as you lie on the hearthrug</l>
       <l n="35">Sleeping in the warmth of the stove ,</l>
       <l n="36">Even through your muddled old canine brain</l>
       <l n="37">Shapes from the past may rove .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="11">
       <l n="38">You 'll scarcely remember , even in a dream ,</l>
       <l n="39">How we brought home a silly little pup .</l>
       <l n="40">With a big square head and little crooked legs</l>
       <l n="41">That could scarcely bear him up ,</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="12">
       <l n="42">But your tail will tap at the memory</l>
       <l n="43">Of a man whose friend you were ,</l>
       <l n="44">Who was always kind though he called you a naughty dog</l>
       <l n="45">When he found you on his chair ;</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="13">
       <l n="46">Who 'd make you face a reproving finger</l>
       <l n="47">And solemnly lecture you</l>
       <l n="48">Till your head hung downwards and you looked very sheepish !</l>
       <l n="49">And you 'll dream of your triumphs too .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="14">
       <l n="50">Of summer evening chases in the garden</l>
       <l n="51">When you dodged us all about with a bone :</l>
       <l n="52">We were three boys , and you were the cleverest ,</l>
       <l n="53">But now we 're two alone .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="15">
       <l n="54">When summer comes again ,</l>
       <l n="55">And the long sunsets fade ,</l>
       <l n="56">We shall have to go on playing the feeble game for two</l>
       <l n="57">That since the war we 've played .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="16">
       <l n="58">And though you run expectant as you always do</l>
       <l n="59">To the uniforms we meet ,</l>
       <l n="60">You 'll never find Willy among all the soldiers</l>
       <l n="61">In even the longest street ,</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="17">
       <l n="62">Nor in any crowd ; yet , strange and bitter thought ,</l>
       <l n="63">Even now were the old words said ,</l>
       <l n="64">If I tried the old trick and said “ Where 's Willy ? ”</l>
       <l n="65">You would quiver and lift your head ,</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="18">
       <l n="66">And your brown eyes would look to ask if I were serious ,</l>
       <l n="67">And wait for the word to spring .</l>
       <l n="68">Sleep undisturbed : I sha'n ' t say that again ,</l>
       <l n="69">You innocent old thing .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="19">
       <l n="70">I must sit , not speaking , on the sofa ,</l>
       <l n="71">While you lie asleep on the floor ;</l>
       <l n="72">For he 's suffered a thing that dogs could n't dream of ,</l>
       <l n="73">And he wo n't be coming here any more .</l>

      <head>THE LAKE</head>
       <l n="1">I am a lake , altered by every wind .</l>
       <l n="2">The mild South breathes upon me , and I spread</l>
       <l n="3">A dance of merry ripples in the sun .</l>
       <l n="4">The West comes stormily and I am troubled ,</l>
       <l n="5">My waves conflict and black depths show between them .</l>
       <l n="6">Under the East wind bitter I grow and chill ,</l>
       <l n="7">Slate-coloured , desolate , hopeless . But when blows</l>
       <l n="8">A steady wind from the North my motion ceases ,</l>
       <l n="9">I am frozen smooth and hard ; my conquered surface</l>
       <l n="10">Returns the skies ’ cold light without a comment .</l>
       <l n="11">I make no sound , nor can I ; nor can I show</l>
       <l n="12">What depth I have , if any depth , below .</l>

       <l n="1">What hues the sunlight had , how rich the shadows were ,</l>
       <l n="2">The blue and tangled shadows dropped from the crusted branches</l>
       <l n="3">Of the warped apple-trees upon the orchard grass .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="4">How heavenly pure the blue of two smooth eggs that lay</l>

       <l n="7">And that small tinkling stream that ran from hedge to hedge ,</l>

       <l n="10">With travelling bubbles mirrored , each one a golden world</l>
       <l n="11">To my enchanted eyes . Then earth was new to me .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="12">But now I walk this earth as it were a lumber room ,</l>

       <l n="15">Long enough to feel its conscious calm assault :</l>
       <l n="16">The strength of it , the word , the royal heart of it .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="17">Childhood will not return ; but have I not the will</l>

       <l n="2">In the smooth grey heaven is poised the pale half moon</l>
       <l n="3">And sheds on the wide grey river a broken reflection .</l>
       <l n="4">Out from the low church-tower the boats are moored</l>
       <l n="5">After the heat of the day , and await the dark .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="6">And here , where the side of the road shelves into the river</l>
       <l n="7">At the gap where barges load and horses drink ,</l>
       <l n="8">There are no horses . And the river is full</l>
       <l n="9">And the water stands by the shore and does not lap .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="10">And a barge lies up for the night this side of the island ,</l>

       <l n="18">To the end of the hoisted boom , and the high dark slips</l>

       <l n="24">Silence . Time is suspended ; that the light fails</l>
       <l n="25">One would not know were it not for the moon in the sky ,</l>
       <l n="26">And the broken moon in the water , whose fractures tell</l>
       <l n="27">Of slow broad ripples that otherwise do not show ,</l>
       <l n="28">Maturing imperceptibly from a pale to a deeper gold ,</l>
       <l n="29">A golden half moon in the sky , and broken gold in the water .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="30">In the water , tranquilly severing , joining , gold :</l>
       <l n="31">Three or four little plates of gold on the river :</l>

      <head>UNDER</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">In this house , she said , in this high second storey ,</l>
       <l n="2">In this room where we sit , above the midnight street ,</l>
       <l n="3">There runs a rivulet , narrow but very rapid ,</l>
       <l n="4">Under the still floor and your unconscious feet .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="5">The lamp on the table made a cone of light</l>
       <l n="6">That spread to the base of the walls : above was in gloom .</l>
       <l n="7">I heard her words with surprise ; had I worked here so long ,</l>
       <l n="8">And never divined that secret of the room ?</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="9">“ But how , ” I asked , “ does the water climb so high ? ”</l>
       <l n="10">“ I do not know , ” she said , “ but the thing is there ;</l>
       <l n="11">Pull up the boards while I go and fetch you a rod . ”</l>
       <l n="12">She passed , and I heard her creaking descend the stair .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="13">And I rose and rolled the Turkey carpet back</l>
       <l n="14">From the two broad boards by the north wall she had named ,</l>
       <l n="15">And , hearing already the crumple of water , I knelt</l>
       <l n="16">And lifted the first of them up ; and the water gleamed ,</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="17">Bordered with little frosted heaps of ice ,</l>
       <l n="18">And , as she came back with a rod and line that swung ,</l>
       <l n="19">I moved the other board ; in the yellow light</l>
       <l n="20">The water trickled frostily , slackly along .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="21">I took the tackle , a stiff black rubber worm ,</l>
       <l n="22">That stuck out its pointed tail from a cumbrous hook ,</l>
       <l n="23">“ But there can n't be fishing in water like this , ” I said .</l>
       <l n="24">And she , with weariness , “ There is no ice there . Look . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="25">And I stood there , gazing down at a stream in spate ,</l>
       <l n="26">Holding the rod in my undecided hand ...</l>
       <l n="27">Till it all in a moment grew smooth and still and clear ,</l>
       <l n="28">And along its deep bottom of slaty grey sand</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="29">Three scattered little trout , as black as tadpoles ,</l>
       <l n="30">Came waggling slowly along the glass-dark lake ,</l>
       <l n="31">And I swung my arm to drop my pointing worm in ,</l>
       <l n="32">And then I stopped again with a little shake .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="9">
       <l n="33">For I heard the thin gnat-like voices of the trout</l>
       <l n="34">— My body felt woolly and sick and astray and cold —</l>
       <l n="35">Crying with mockery in them : “ You are not allowed</l>
       <l n="36">To take us , you know , under ten years old . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="10">
       <l n="37">And the room swam , the calm woman and the yellow lamp ,</l>
       <l n="38">The table , and the dim-glistering walls , and the floor ,</l>
       <l n="39">And the stream sank away , and all whirled dizzily ,</l>
       <l n="40">And I moaned , and the pain at my heart grew more and more .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="11">
       <l n="41">And I fainted away , utterly miserable .</l>
       <l n="42">Falling in a place where there was nothing to pass ,</l>
       <l n="43">Knowing all sorrows and the mothers and sisters of sorrows ,</l>
       <l n="44">And the pain of the darkness before anything ever was .</l>

       <l n="1">Beloved , when my heart 's awake to God</l>
       <l n="2">And all the world becomes His testimony ,</l>
       <l n="3">In you I most do see , in your brave spirit ,</l>
       <l n="4">Erect and certain , flashing deeds of light ,</l>
       <l n="5">A pure jet from the fountain of all being ,</l>
       <l n="6">A scripture clearer than all else to read .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="7">And when belief was dead and God a myth ,</l>
       <l n="8">And the world seemed a wandering mote of evil ,</l>
       <l n="9">Endurable only by its impermanence ,</l>
       <l n="10">And all the planets perishable urns</l>
       <l n="11">Of perished ashes , to you alone I clung</l>
       <l n="12">Amid the unspeakable loneliness of the universe .</l>
