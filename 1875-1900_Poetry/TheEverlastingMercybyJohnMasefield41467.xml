     <l n="2">From ‘ 41 to ‘ 51</l>
     <l n="3">I was my folk 's contrary son ;</l>
     <l n="4">I bit my father 's hand right through</l>
     <l n="5">And broke my mother 's heart in two .</l>
     <l n="6">I sometimes go without my dinner</l>
     <l n="7">Now that I know the times I 've gi'n her .</l>

     <l n="8">From ‘ 51 to ‘ 6l</l>
     <l n="9">I cut my teeth and took to fun .</l>
     <l n="10">I learned what not to be afraid of</l>
     <l n="11">And what stuff women 's lips are made of ;</l>
     <l n="12">I learned with what a rosy feeling</l>
     <l n="13">Good ale makes floors seem like the ceiling ,</l>
     <l n="14">And how the moon gives shiny light</l>
     <l n="15">To lads as roll home singing by't .</l>
     <l n="16">My blood did leap , my flesh did revel ,</l>
     <l n="17">Saul Kane was tokened to the devil .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="18">From ‘ 61 to ‘ 67</l>
     <l n="19">I lived in disbelief of heaven .</l>
     <l n="20">I drunk , I fought , I poached , I whored ,</l>
     <l n="21">I did despite unto the Lord ,</l>
     <l n="22">I cursed , ‘ twould make a man look pale ,</l>
     <l n="23">And nineteen times I went to jail .</l>
     <l n="24">Now , friends , observe and look upon me ,</l>
     <l n="25">Mark how the Lord took pity on me .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="26">By Dead Man 's Thorn , while setting wires ,</l>
     <l n="27">Who should come up but Billy Myers ,</l>
     <l n="28">A friend of mine , who used to be</l>
     <l n="29">As black a sprig of hell as me ,</l>
     <l n="30">With whom I 'd planned , to save encroachin ’ ,</l>
     <l n="31">Which fields and coverts each should poach in .</l>
     <l n="32">Now when he saw me set my snare ,</l>
     <l n="33">He tells me ‘ Get to hell from there .</l>
     <l n="34">This field is mine , ’ he says , ‘ by right ;</l>
     <l n="35">If you poach here , there 'll be a fight .</l>
     <l n="36">Out now , ’ he says , ‘ and leave your wire ;</l>
     <l n="37">It 's mine . ’</l>

     <l n="47">‘ I am . ’</l>
     <l n="48">‘ I 'll fight you for it . ’</l>
     <l n="49">‘ Right , by damn .</l>
     <l n="50">Not now , though , I 've a-sprained my thumb ,</l>
     <l n="51">We 'll fight after the harvest hum .</l>
     <l n="52">And Silas Jones , that bookie wide ,</l>
     <l n="53">Will make a purse five pounds a side . ’</l>
     <l n="54">Those were the words , that was the place</l>
     <l n="55">By which God brought me into grace .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="56">On Wood Top Field the peewits go</l>
     <l n="57">Mewing and wheeling ever so ;</l>
     <l n="58">And like the shaking of a timbrel</l>
     <l n="59">Cackles the laughter of the whimbrel .</l>
     <l n="60">In the old quarry-pit they say</l>
     <l n="61">Head-keeper Pike was made away .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="62">He walks , head-keeper Pike , for harm ,</l>
     <l n="63">He taps the windows of the farm ;</l>
     <l n="64">The blood drips from his broken chin ,</l>
     <l n="65">He taps and begs to be let in .</l>
     <l n="66">On Wood Top , nights , I 've shaked to hark</l>
     <l n="67">The peewits wambling in the dark</l>
     <l n="68">Lest in the dark the old man might</l>
     <l n="69">Creep up to me to beg a light .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="70">But Wood Top grass is short and sweet</l>
     <l n="71">And springy to a boxer 's feet ;</l>
     <l n="72">At harvest hum the moon so bright</l>
     <l n="73">Did shine on Wood Top for the fight .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="74">When Bill was stripped down to his bends</l>
     <l n="75">I thought how long we two 'd been friends ,</l>
     <l n="76">And in my mind , about that wire ,</l>
     <l n="77">I thought ‘ He 's right , I am a liar ,</l>
     <l n="78">As sure as skilly 's made in prison</l>
     <l n="79">The right to poach that copse is his'n .</l>
     <l n="80">I 'll have no luck to-night , ’ thinks I .</l>
     <l n="81">‘ I 'm fighting to defend a lie .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="82">And this moonshiny evening 's fun</l>
     <l n="83">Is worse than aught I ever done . ’</l>
     <l n="84">And thinking that way my heart bled so</l>
     <l n="85">I almost stept to Bill and said so .</l>
     <l n="86">And now Bill 's dead I would be glad</l>
     <l n="87">If I could only think I had .</l>
     <l n="88">But no . I put the thought away</l>
     <l n="89">For fear of what my friends would say .</l>
     <l n="90">They 'd backed me , see ? O Lord , the sin</l>
     <l n="91">Done for the things there 's money in .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="92">The stakes were drove , the ropes were hitched ,</l>
     <l n="93">Into the ring my hat I pitched .</l>
     <l n="94">My corner faced the Squire 's park</l>
     <l n="95">Just where the fir-trees make it dark ;</l>
     <l n="96">The place where I begun poor Nell</l>
     <l n="97">Upon the woman 's road to hell .</l>
     <l n="98">I thought oft , sitting in my corner</l>
     <l n="99">After the time-keep struck his warner</l>
     <l n="100">( Two brandy flasks , for fear of noise ,</l>
     <l n="101">Clinked out the time to us two boys ) .</l>
     <l n="102">And while my seconds chafed and gloved me</l>
     <l n="103">I thought of Nell 's eyes when she loved me ,</l>
     <l n="104">And wondered how my tot would end ,</l>
     <l n="105">First Nell cast off and now my friend ;</l>
     <l n="106">And in the moonlight dim and wan</l>
     <l n="107">I knew quite well my luck was gone ;</l>
     <l n="108">And looking round I felt a spite</l>
     <l n="109">At all who 'd come to see me fight ;</l>
     <l n="110">The five and forty human faces</l>
     <l n="111">Inflamed by drink and going to races ,</l>
     <l n="112">Faces of men who 'd never been</l>
     <l n="113">Merry or true or live or clean ;</l>
     <l n="114">Who 'd never felt the boxer 's trim</l>
     <l n="115">Of brain divinely knit to limb ,</l>
     <l n="116">Nor felt the whole live body go</l>
     <l n="117">One tingling health from top to toe ;</l>
     <l n="118">Nor took a punch nor given a swing ,</l>
     <l n="119">But just soaked deady round the ring</l>
     <l n="120">Until their brains and bloods were foul</l>
     <l n="121">Enough to make their throttles howl ,</l>
     <l n="122">While we whom Jesus died to teach</l>
     <l n="123">Fought round on round , three minutes each .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="124">And thinking that , you 'll understand</l>
     <l n="125">I thought , ‘ I 'll go and take Bill 's hand .</l>
     <l n="126">I 'll up and say the fault was mine ,</l>
     <l n="127">He sha'n ' t make play for these here swine . ’</l>
     <l n="128">And then I thought that that was silly ,</l>
     <l n="129">They 'd think I was afraid of Billy :</l>
     <l n="130">They 'd think ( I thought it , God forgive me )</l>
     <l n="131">I funked the hiding Bill could give me .</l>
     <l n="132">And that thought made me mad and hot .</l>
     <l n="133">‘ Think that , will they ? Well , they shall not .</l>
     <l n="134">They sha'n ' t think that . I will not . I 'm</l>
     <l n="135">Damned if I will . I will not . ’</l>
     <l n="136">Time !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="137">From the beginning of the bout</l>
     <l n="138">My luck was gone , my hand was out .</l>
     <l n="139">Right from the start Bill called the play ,</l>
     <l n="140">But I was quick and kept away</l>
     <l n="141">Till the fourth round , when work got mixed ,</l>
     <l n="142">And then I knew Bill had me fixed .</l>
     <l n="143">My hand was out , why , Heaven knows ;</l>
     <l n="144">Bill punched me when and where he chose .</l>
     <l n="145">Through two more rounds we quartered wide</l>
     <l n="146">And all the time my hands seemed tied ;</l>
     <l n="147">Bill punched me when and where he pleased .</l>
     <l n="148">The cheering from my backers ceased ,</l>
     <l n="149">But every punch I heard a yell</l>
     <l n="150">Of ‘ That 's the style , Bill , give him hell . ’</l>
     <l n="151">No one for me , but Jimmy 's light</l>
     <l n="152">‘ Straight left ! Straight left ! ’ and ‘ Watch his right . ’</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="153">I do n't know how a boxer goes</l>
     <l n="154">When all his body hums from blows ;</l>
     <l n="155">I know I seemed to rock and spin ,</l>
     <l n="156">I do n't know how I saved my chin ;</l>
     <l n="157">I know I thought my only friend</l>
     <l n="158">Was that clinked flask at each round 's end</l>
     <l n="159">When my two seconds , Ed and Jimmy ,</l>
     <l n="160">Had sixty seconds help to gimme .</l>
     <l n="161">But in the ninth , with pain and knocks</l>
     <l n="162">I stopped : I could n't fight nor box .</l>
     <l n="163">Bill missed his swing , the light was tricky ,</l>
     <l n="164">But I went down , and stayed down , dicky .</l>
     <l n="165">‘ Get up , ’ cried Jim . I said , ‘ I will . ’</l>
     <l n="166">Then all the gang yelled , ‘ Out him , Bill .</l>
     <l n="167">Out him . ’ Bill rushed ... and Clink , Clink , Clink .</l>
     <l n="168">Time ! and Jim 's knee , and rum to drink .</l>
     <l n="169">And round the ring there ran a titter :</l>
     <l n="170">‘ Saved by the call , the bloody quitter . ’</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="171">They drove ( a dodge that never fails )</l>
     <l n="172">A pin beneath my finger nails .</l>
     <l n="173">They poured what seemed a running beck</l>
     <l n="174">Of cold spring water down my neck ;</l>
     <l n="175">Jim with a lancet quick as flies</l>
     <l n="176">Lowered the swellings round my eyes .</l>
     <l n="177">They sluiced my legs and fanned my face</l>
     <l n="178">Through all that blessed minute 's grace ;</l>
     <l n="179">They gave my calves a thorough kneading ,</l>
     <l n="180">They salved my cuts and stopped the bleeding .</l>
     <l n="181">A gulp of liquor dulled the pain ,</l>
     <l n="182">And then the two flasks clinked again .</l>
     <l n="183">Time !</l>
     <l n="184">There was Bill as grim as death .</l>
     <l n="185">He rushed , I clinched , to get more breath .</l>
     <l n="186">And breath I got , though Billy bats</l>
     <l n="187">Some stinging short-arms in my slats .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="188">And when we broke , as I foresaw ,</l>
     <l n="189">He swung his right in for the jaw .</l>
     <l n="190">I stopped it on my shoulder bone ,</l>
     <l n="191">And at the shock I heard Bill groan —</l>
     <l n="192">A little groan or moan or grunt</l>
     <l n="193">As though I 'd hit his wind a bunt .</l>
     <l n="194">At that , I clinched , and while we clinched ,</l>
     <l n="195">His old-time right-arm dig was flinched ,</l>
     <l n="196">And when we broke he hit me light</l>
     <l n="197">As though he did n't trust his right ,</l>
     <l n="198">He flapped me somehow with his wrist</l>
     <l n="199">As though he could n't use his fist ,</l>
     <l n="200">And when he hit he winced with pain .</l>
     <l n="201">I thought , ‘ Your sprained thumb 's crocked again . ’</l>
     <l n="202">So I got strength and Bill gave ground ,</l>
     <l n="203">And that round was an easy round .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="204">During the wait my Jimmy said ,</l>
     <l n="205">‘ What 's making Billy fight so dead ?</l>
     <l n="206">He 's all to pieces . Is he blown ? ’</l>
     <l n="207">‘ His thumb 's out . ’</l>
     <l n="208">‘ No ? Then it 's your own .</l>
     <l n="209">It 's all your own , but do n't be rash —</l>
     <l n="210">He 's got the goods if you 've got cash ,</l>
     <l n="211">And what one hand can do he 'll do ,</l>
     <l n="212">Be careful this next round or two . ’</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="19">
     <l n="213">Time ! There was Bill , and I felt sick</l>
     <l n="214">That luck should play so mean a trick</l>
     <l n="215">And give me leave to knock him out</l>
     <l n="216">After he 'd plainly won the bout .</l>
     <l n="217">But by the way the man came at me</l>
     <l n="218">He made it plain he meant to bat me ;</l>
     <l n="219">If you 'd a seen the way he come</l>
     <l n="220">You would n't think he 'd crocked a thumb .</l>
     <l n="221">With all his skill and all his might</l>
     <l n="222">He clipped me dizzy left and right ;</l>
     <l n="223">The Lord knows what the effort cost ,</l>
     <l n="224">But he was mad to think he 'd lost ,</l>
     <l n="225">And knowing nothing else could save him</l>
     <l n="226">He did n't care what pain it gave him .</l>
     <l n="227">He called the music and the dance</l>
     <l n="228">For five rounds more and gave no chance .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="20">
     <l n="229">Try to imagine if you can</l>
     <l n="230">The kind of manhood in the man ,</l>
     <l n="231">And if you 'd like to feel his pain ,</l>
     <l n="232">You sprain your thumb and hit the sprain ,</l>
     <l n="233">And hit it hard , with all your power</l>
     <l n="234">On something hard for half-an-hour ,</l>

    <p n="8">“ Mr Masefield is no common realist , but universalizes his tragedy in the grand manner .... We are convinced that he is writing truly of human nature , which is the vital thing .... The last few stanzas show us pastoral poetry in the very perfection of simplicity . ” — Spectator .</p>
    <p n="9">“ In ‘ The Widow in the Bye Street ’ all Mr Masefield 's passionate love of loveliness is utterly fused with the violent and unlovely story , which glows with an inner harmony . The poem , it is true , ends on a note of idyllism which recalls Theocritus ; but this is no touch of eternal decoration . Inevitably the story has worked towards this culmination . ” — Bookman .</p>

    <p n="12">“ In this Roman tragedy , while we admire its closely knit structure , dramatic effectiveness , and atmosphere of reality ... the warmth and colour of the diction are the most notable things .... He knows the art of phrasing ; he has the instinct for and by them . ” — Athaeneum .</p>
    <p n="13">“ He has written a great tragedy .... The dialogue is written in strong , simple and nervous prose , flashing with poetic insight , significance and suggestion . The characters are intensely alive , the situations are handled by a master hand , and the whole play is pregnant with that high and solemn pathos which is the gift of the born writer of tragedies . ” — Morning Post .</p>
