    <head>Introduction</head>
    <p n="1">Science may conquer the stars , but it does nothing by jumps . As a Scientist , as well as a philosopher , I am accustomed to reaching the Transcendental by winding paths . It is characteristic of me that I should have consented to preface this remarkable Sonnet Cycle only after supreme deliberation , and that I should at last have determined to speak in behalf of the Car Conductor for the following reasons :</p>
    <p n="2">1 . As a Botanist I am fascinated by the phenomenon of Genius flourishing from bud to flower , from flower to seed .</p>
    <p n="3">2 . As a Psychologist I am anxious to establish once and for all , both by plano-inductive and precoordinate systems of logic , the Status of Slang .</p>
    <p n="4">What position does Slang occupy in the thought of the world ? Let us turn to Zoology for an answer .</p>
    <p n="5">No traces of Slang may be found among mollusks , crustaceans or the lower invertebrates . Slang is not common to vertebrate fishes or to whales , seals , reptiles or anthropoid apes -  in a word , slang-speaking is nowhere prevalent among lower animals . It may , then , be definitely and clearly asserted that Slang is the natural , logical expression of the Human Race . If Man , then , is the highest of created mammals , is not his natural speech ( Slang ) the highest of created languages ? It is generally conceded that Literature is the most exalted expression of Language . Would not the Literature , then , which employs the highest of created languages ( Slang ) be the supreme Literature of the world ?</p>
    <p n="6">By such logical , irrefutable , inductive steps have I proven not only the Status of Slang , but the literary importance of these Sonnets which it is at once my scientific duty and my esthetic pleasure to introduce .</p>
    <p n="7">The twenty-six exquisite Sonnets which form this Cycle were written , probably , during the years 1906 and 1907 . Their author was William Henry Smith , a car conductor , who penned his passion , from time to time , on the back of transfer-slips which he treasured carefully in his hat<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>. We have it from no less an authority than Professor Sznuysko that the Car Conductor usually performed these literary feats in public , writing between fares on the rear platform of a Sixth Avenue car . Smith 's devotion to his Musa Sanctissima was often so hypnotic , I am told , that he neglected to let passengers on and off -  nay , it is even held by some critics that he occasionally forgot to collect a fare . But be it said to his undying honor that his Employers never suffered from such carelessness , for it was the custom of our Poet to demand double fares from the old , the feeble and the mentally deficient .</p>
    <p n="8">Even as the illimitable ichor of star-dust , the mysterious Demiurge of the Universe , keeps the suns and planets to their orbitary revolutions , so must environment mark the Fas and Nefas of Genius . Plato 's Idea of the Archetypal Man was due , perhaps , as much to the serene weather conditions of Academe as to the marvelous mentality of Plato . What had Job eaten for breakfast that he should have given utterance to his magnificent Lamentation ? Was he the discoverer of Human Sorrow or the pioneer of Human Dyspepsia ?</p>
    <p n="9">It is not altogether radical on my part , then , for me to assert that many of the stylistic peculiarities found in these Sonnets are attributable to the locale of their inspiration the rear platform of a Sixth Avenue car . One can plainly hear the jar and jounce of the elliptical wheels , the cry , “ Step lively ! ” the six o'clock stampede , the lament of the strap-hanging multitude in such lines as these :</p>
    <p n="10">“ Three days with sad skidoo have came and went , Yet Pansy cometh nix to ride with me . I rubber vainly at the throng to see Her golden locks -  gee ! such a discontent ! Perhaps she 's beat it with some soapy gent -  "</p>
    <p n="11">Where are lines like these to be found in the Italian of Petrarch ? Where has Tasso uttered an impassioned confession to resemble this :</p>
    <p n="12">“ But when I ogle Pansy in the throng My heart turns over twice and rings a gong ” ?</p>
    <p n="13">Of the human or personal record of William Henry Smith very little has been discovered . Looking over the books of the Metropolitan Street Railway I unearthed the following entry :</p>
    <p n="14">“ Nov. 1 , 1907 : ”</p>
    <p n="15">“ W. H. Smith , conductor , discharged . ”</p>
    <p n="16">“ Remarks : -  Car No . 21144 , William Smith , conductor , ran into large brewery truck at So . E. cor . Sixth Ave . It is reported that Smith , to the neglect of his duty , was reading poetry from a book called ‘ Sonnets of de Heredia ’ at the time of the accident . Three Italians were slightly injured by the accident , and Ethelbert Pangwyn , an actor starring in ‘ The Girl and the Idiot , ’ a musical comedy , was killed . ”</p>
    <p n="17">“ Smith was held for manslaughter , but Judge O ’ Rafferty , who had seen ‘ The Girl and the Idiot , ’ discharged the defendant , averring that the killing of Pangwyn did not constitute a crime . ”</p>
    <p n="18">What , then , has become of this minstrel who sang the Minnelieder of the Car-barns ? Like Homer , like Omar , like Sappho , like Shakespeare , he is a Voice singing out of the mists . He was but a Name to his employers ; and his friends , if he has friends , remember him not . These Sonnets , written neatly on twenty-six violet transfer-slips , were discovered , together with a rejection blank from a leading magazine , in the Dead Letter office . According to the current folk-lore in Harlem and the Bronx , Smith is now living in California employed as a brakeman on the Southern Pacific Railroad . Some aver that Pansy fell heiress to a sausage establishment and moved to Italy with her Poet . Still others maintain that Pansy , Gill the Grip and Maxy the Firebug never existed in real life -  were merely the mind-children of a Symbolist and a dreamer of dreams .</p>
    <p n="19">To the latter theory I incline at a scholarly angle . This Cycle may be taken , perhaps , not so much as a living record of human experience as a lofty parable sounding the key-note of all human life . Gill the Grip is the Iago , the Mefistofele , the symbolism of a malevolent destiny . Maxy the Firebug may be the Poet 's interpretation of the Social Unrest , of Doubt , of progressive irresponsibility . Would it be going too far , then , to say that Pansy stands to us as the symbol of Pan-girlism -  as an almost Anacreontic yearning for the type ? Or may not these Sonnets be taken , in a way , as a modern Vita Nuova wherein a Sixth Avenue Alighieri calls to his Beatrice and mourns within when ,</p>
    <p n="20">“ Pansy-girl refuses to occur ? ”</p>
    <p n="21">So much for the Poet and his Purpose . Should any one of the readers of this Cycle doubt the enduring greatness of the lines , let him consider that I , Wolfgang Copernicus Addleburger , have seen fit to introduce them to immortality .</p>
