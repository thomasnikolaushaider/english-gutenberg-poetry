    <head>Introduction</head>
    <p n="1">I</p>
    <p n="2">Rupert Brooke was both fair to see and winning in his ways . There was at the first contact both bloom and charm ; and most of all there was life . To use the word his friends describe him by , he was “ vivid ” . This vitality , though manifold in expression , is felt primarily in his sensations — surprise mingled with delight —</p>
    <p n="3">“ One after one , like tasting a sweet food . ”</p>
    <p n="4">This is life 's “ first fine rapture ” . It makes him patient to name over those myriad things ( each of which seems like a fresh discovery ) curious but potent , and above all common , that he “ loved ” , — he the “ Great Lover ” . Lover of what , then ? Why , of</p>
    <p n="5">“ White plates and cups clean-gleaming , Ringed with blue lines , ” —</p>
    <p n="6">and the like , through thirty lines of exquisite words ; and he is captivated by the multiple brevity of these vignettes of sense , keen , momentary , ecstatic with the morning dip of youth in the wonderful stream . The poem is a catalogue of vital sensations and “ dear names ” as well . “ All these have been my loves . ”</p>
    <p n="7">The spring of these emotions is the natural body , but it sends pulsations far into the spirit . The feeling rises in direct observation , but it is soon aware of the “ outlets of the sky ” . He sees objects practically unrelated , and links them in strings ; or he sees them pictorially ; or , he sees pictures immersed as it were in an atmosphere of thought . When the process is complete , the thought suggests the picture and is its origin . Then the Great Lover revisits the bottom of the monstrous world , and imaginatively and thoughtfully recreates that strange under-sea , whose glooms and gleams and muds are well known to him as a strong and delighted swimmer ; or , at the last , drifts through the dream of a South Sea lagoon , still with a philosophical question in his mouth . Yet one can hardly speak of “ completion ” . These are real first flights . What we have in this volume is not so much a work of art as an artist in his birth trying the wings of genius .</p>
    <p n="8">The poet loves his new-found element . He clings to mortality ; to life , not thought ; or , as he puts it , to the concrete , — let the abstract “ go pack ! ” “ There 's little comfort in the wise , ” he ends . But in the unfolding of his precocious spirit , the literary control comes uppermost ; his boat , finding its keel , swings to the helm of mind . How should it be otherwise for a youth well-born , well-bred , in college air ? Intellectual primacy showed itself to him in many wandering “ loves ” , fine lover that he was ; but in the end he was an intellectual lover , and the magnet seems to have been especially powerful in the ghosts of the men of “ wit ” , Donne , Marvell — erudite lords of language , poets in another world than ours , a less “ ample ether ” , a less “ divine air ” , our fathers thought , but poets of “ eternity ” . A quintessential drop of intellect is apt to be in poetic blood . How Platonism fascinates the poets , like a shining bait ! Rupert Brooke will have none of it ; but at a turn of the verse he is back at it , examining , tasting , refusing . In those alternate drives of the thought in his South Sea idyl ( clever as tennis play ) how he slips from phenomenon to idea and reverses , happy with either , it seems , “ were t'other dear charmer away ” . How bravely he tries to free himself from the cling of earth , at the close of the “ Great Lover ” ! How little he succeeds ! His muse knew only earthly tongues , — so far as he understood .</p>
    <p n="9">Why this persistent cling to mortality , — with its quick-coming cry against death and its heaped anathemas on the transformations of decay ? It is the old story once more : — the vision of the first poets , the world that “ passes away ” . The poetic eye of Keats saw it , —</p>
    <p n="10">“ Beauty that must die , And Joy whose hand is ever at his lips Bidding adieu . ”</p>
    <p n="11">The reflective mind of Arnold meditated it , —</p>
    <p n="12">“ the world that seems To lie before us like a land of dreams , So various , so beautiful , so new , Hath really neither joy , nor love , nor light , Nor certitude , nor peace , nor help for pain . ” —</p>
    <p n="13">So Rupert Brooke , —</p>
    <p n="14">“ But the best I 've known , Stays here , and changes , breaks , grows old , is blown About the winds of the world , and fades from brains Of living men , and dies . Nothing remains . ”</p>
    <p n="15">And yet , —</p>
    <p n="16">“ Oh , never a doubt but somewhere I shall wake ; ”</p>
    <p n="17">again , —</p>
    <p n="18">“ the light , Returning , shall give back the golden hours , Ocean a windless level . . . . ”</p>
    <p n="19">again , best of all , in the last word , —</p>
    <p n="20">“ Still may Time hold some golden space Where I 'll unpack that scented store Of song and flower and sky and face , And count , and touch , and turn them o'er , Musing upon them . ”</p>
    <p n="21">He cannot forego his sensations , that “ box of compacted sweets ” . He even forefeels a ghostly landscape where two shall go wandering through the night , “ alone ” . So the faith that broke its chrysalis in the first disillusionment of boyhood , in “ Second Best ” , beautiful with the burden of Greek lyricism , ends triumphant with the spirit still unsubdued . —</p>
    <p n="22">“ Proud , then , clear-eyed and laughing , go to greet Death as a friend . ”</p>
    <p n="23">So go , “ with unreluctant tread ” . But in the disillusionment of beauty and of love there is an older tone . With what bitter savor , with what grossness of diction , caught from the Elizabethan and satirical elements in his culture , he spends anger in words ! He reacts , he rebels , he storms . A dozen poems hardly exhaust his gall . It is not merely that beauty and joy and love are transient , now , but in their going they are corrupted into their opposites , — ugliness , pain , indifference . And his anger once stilled by speech , what lassitude follows !</p>
    <p n="24">Life , in this volume , is hardly less evident by its ecstasy than by its collapse . It is a book of youth , sensitive , vigorous , sound ; but it is the fruit of intensity , and bears the traits . The search for solitude , the relief from crowds , the open door into nature ; the sense of flight and escape ; the repeated thought of safety , the insistent fatigue , the cry for sleep ; — all these bear confession in their faces . “ Flight ” , “ Town and Country ” , “ The Voice ” , are eloquent of what they leave untold ; and the climax of “ Retrospect ” , —</p>
    <p n="25">“ And I should sleep , and I should sleep , ” —</p>
    <p n="26">or the sestet of “ Waikiki ” , or the whole fainting sonnet entitled “ A Memory ” , belong to the nadir of vitality . At moments weariness set in like a spiritual tide . I associate , too , with such moods , psychologically at least , his visions of the “ arrested moment ” , as in “ Dining-Room Tea ” , — a sort of trance state — or in the pendant sonnet . Analogous moods are not infrequent in the great poets . Rupert Brooke seems to have faltered , nervously , at times ; these poems mirror faithfully such moments . But even when the image of life , imaginative or real , falters so , how essentially vital it still is , and clothed in an exquisite body of words like the traditional “ rainbow hues of the dying fish ” ! For I cannot express too strongly my admiration of the literary sense of this young poet , and my delight in it . “ All these have been my loves , ” he says , if I may repeat the phrase ; but he seems to have loved the words , as much as the things , — “ dear names ” , he adds . The born man of letters speaks there . So , when his pulse is at its lowest , he cannot forget the beautiful surface of his South Sea idyls or of versified English gardens and lanes . He cared as much for the expression as for the thing , which is what makes a man of letters . So fixed is this habit that his art , truly , is independent of his bodily state . In his poems of “ collapse ” as in those of “ ecstasy ” he seems to me equally master of his mood , — like those poets who are “ for all time ” . His literary skill in verse was ripe , how long so ever he might have to live .</p>
    <p n="27">II</p>
    <p n="28">To come , then , to art , which is above personality , what of that ? Art is , at most , but the mortal relic of genius ; yet it is true of it that , like Ozymandias ’ statue , “ nothing beside remains ” . Rupert Brooke was already perfected in verbal and stylistic execution . He might have grown in variety , richness and significance , in scope and in detail , no doubt ; but as an artisan in metrical words and pauses , he was past apprenticeship . He was still a restless experimenter , but in much he was a master . In the brief stroke of description , which he inherited from his early attachment to the concrete ; in the rush of words , especially verbs ; in the concatenation of objects , the flow of things ‘ en masse ’ through his verse , still with the impulse of “ the bright speed ” he had at the source ; in his theatrical impersonation of abstractions , as in “ The Funeral of Youth ” , where for once the abstract and the concrete are happily fused ; — in all these there are the elements , and in the last there is the perfection , of mastery . For one thing , he knew how to end . It is with him a dramatic secret . The brief stroke does this work time and time again in his verse , nowhere better than in “ at dead YOUTH 's funeral : ” all were there , —</p>
    <p n="29">“ All , except only LOVE — LOVE had died long ago . ”</p>
    <p n="30">The poem is like a vision of an old time MASQUE : —</p>
    <p n="31">“ The sweet lad RHYME ” —— “ ARDOUR , the sunlight on his greying hair ” —— “ BEAUTY . . . pale in her black ; dry-eyed , she stood alone . ”</p>
    <p n="32">How vivid ! The lines owe something to his eye for costume , for staging ; but , as mere picture writing , it is as firm as if carved on an obelisk . And as he reconciled concrete and abstract here , so he had left his short breath , in those earlier lines , behind , and had come into the long sweep and open water of great style : —</p>
    <p n="33">“ And light on waving grass , he knows not when , And feet that ran , but where , he cannot tell . ”</p>
    <p n="34">Or ; —</p>
    <p n="35">“ And feel , who have laid our groping hands away ; And see , no longer blinded by our eyes , ”</p>
    <p n="36">Or , more briefly , —</p>
    <p n="37">“ In wise majestic melancholy train . ”</p>
    <p n="38">And this , —</p>
    <p n="39">“ And evening hush broken by homing wings , ”</p>
    <p n="40">Such lines as these , apart from their beauty , are in the best manner of English poetic style . So , in many minor ways , he shuffled contrast and climax , and the like , adept in the handling of poetic rhetoric that he had come to be ; but in three ways he was conspicuously successful in his art .</p>
    <p n="41">The first of these — they are all in the larger forms of art — is the dramatic sonnet , by which I do not mean merely a sonnet in dialogue or advancing by simple contrast ; but one in which there may be these things , but also there is a tragic reversal or its equivalent . Not to consider it too curiously , take “ The Hill ” . This sonnet is beautiful in action and diction ; its eloquence speeds it on with a lift ; the situation is the very crest of life ; then , —</p>
    <p n="42">“ We shall go down with unreluctant tread , Rose-crowned into the darkness ! . . . Proud we were , And laughed , that had such brave true things to say . — And then you suddenly cried and turned away . ”</p>
    <p n="43">The dramatic sonnet in English has not gone beyond that , for beauty , for brevity , for tragic effect , — nor , I add , for unspoken loyalty to reality . Reality was , perhaps , what he most dearly wished for ; here he achieved it . In many another sonnet he won the laurel ; but if I were to venture to choose , it is in the dramatic handling of the sonnet that he is most individual and characteristic .</p>
    <p n="44">The second great success of his genius , formally considered , lay in the narrative idyl , either in the Miltonic way of flashing bits of English country landscape before the eye , as in “ Grantchester ” , or by applying essentially the same method to the water world of fishes or the South Sea world , both on a philosophic background . These are all master poems of a kaleidoscopic beauty and charm , where the brief pictures play in and out of a woven veil of thought , irony , mood , with a delightful intellectual pleasuring . He thoroughly enjoys doing the poetical magic . Such bits of English retreats or Pacific paradises , so full of idyllic charm , exquisite in image and movement , are among the rarest of poetic treasures . The thought of Milton and of Marvell only adds an old world charm to the most modern of the works of the Muses . What lightness of touch , what ease of movement , what brilliancy of hue ! What vivacity throughout ! Even in “ Retrospect ” , what actuality !</p>
    <p n="45">And the third success is what I should call the “ melange ” . That is , the method of indiscrimination by which he gathers up experience , and pours it out again in language , with full disregard of its relative values . His good taste saves him from what in another would be shipwreck , but this indifference to values , this apparent lack of selection in material , while at times it gives a huddled flow , more than anything else “ modernizes ” the verse . It yields , too , an effect of abundant vitality , and it makes facile the change from grave to gay and the like . The “ melange ” , as I call it , is rather an innovation in English verse , and to be found only rarely . It exists , however ; and especially it was dear to Keats in his youth . It is by excellent taste , and by style , that the poet here overcomes its early difficulties .</p>
    <p n="46">In these three formal ways , besides in minor matters , it appears to me that Rupert Brooke , judged by the most orthodox standards , had succeeded in poetry .</p>
    <p n="47">III</p>
    <p n="48">But in his first notes , if I may indulge my private taste , I find more of the intoxication of the god . These early poems are the lyrical cries and luminous flares of a dawn , no doubt ; but they are incarnate of youth . Capital among them is “ Blue Evening ” . It is original and complete . In its whispering embraces of sense , in the terror of seizure of the spirit , in the tranquil euthanasia of the end by the touch of speechless beauty , it seems to me a true symbol of life whole and entire . It is beautiful in language and feeling , with an extraordinary clarity and rise of power ; and , above all , though rare in experience , it is real . A young poet 's poem ; but it has a quality never captured by perfect art . A poem for poets , no doubt ; but that is the best kind . So , too , the poem , entitled “ Sleeping Out ” , charms me and stirs me with its golden clangors and crying flames of emotion as it mounts up to “ the white one flame ” , to “ the laughter and the lips of light ” . It is like a holy Italian picture , — remote , inaccessible , alone . The “ white flame ” seems to have had a mystic meaning to the boy ; it occurs repeatedly . And another poem , — not to make too long a story of my private enthusiasms — “ Ante Aram ” , — wakes all my classical blood , —</p>
    <p n="49">“ voice more sweet than the far plaint of viols is , Or the soft moan of any grey-eyed lute player . ”</p>
    <p n="50">But these things are arcana .</p>
    <p n="51">IV</p>
    <p n="52">There is a grave in Scyros , amid the white and pinkish marble of the isle , the wild thyme and the poppies , near the green and blue waters . There Rupert Brooke was buried . Thither have gone the thoughts of his countrymen , and the hearts of the young especially . It will long be so . For a new star shines in the English heavens . G. E. W. Beverly , Mass ., October , 1915 .</p>

       <l n="1">Here in the dark , O heart ;</l>
       <l n="2">Alone with the enduring Earth , and Night ,</l>
       <l n="3">And Silence , and the warm strange smell of clover ;</l>
       <l n="4">Clear-visioned , though it break you ; far apart</l>
       <l n="5">From the dead best , the dear and old delight ;</l>
       <l n="6">Throw down your dreams of immortality ,</l>
       <l n="7">O faithful , O foolish lover !</l>
       <l n="8">Here 's peace for you , and surety ; here the one</l>
       <l n="9">Wisdom — the truth ! — “ All day the good glad sun</l>
       <l n="10">Showers love and labour on you , wine and song ;</l>
       <l n="11">The greenwood laughs , the wind blows , all day long</l>
       <l n="12">Till night . ” And night ends all things .</l>
       <l n="13">Then shall be</l>
       <l n="14">No lamp relumed in heaven , no voices crying ,</l>
       <l n="15">Or changing lights , or dreams and forms that hover !</l>
       <l n="16">( And , heart , for all your sighing ,</l>
       <l n="17">That gladness and those tears are over , over . . . . )</l>
     </lg>
     <p>And has the truth brought no new hope at all , Heart , that you 're weeping yet for Paradise ? Do they still whisper , the old weary cries ? “ ‘ MID YOUTH AND SONG , FEASTING AND CARNIVAL , THROUGH LAUGHTER , THROUGH THE ROSES , AS OF OLD COMES DEATH , ON SHADOWY AND RELENTLESS FEET , DEATH , UNAPPEASABLE BY PRAYER OR GOLD ; DEATH IS THE END , THE END ! ” Proud , then , clear-eyed and laughing , go to greet Death as a friend !</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">Exile of immortality , strongly wise ,</l>
       <l n="2">Strain through the dark with undesirous eyes</l>
       <l n="3">To what may lie beyond it . Sets your star ,</l>
       <l n="4">O heart , for ever ! Yet , behind the night ,</l>
       <l n="5">Waits for the great unborn , somewhere afar ,</l>
       <l n="6">Some white tremendous daybreak . And the light ,</l>
       <l n="7">Returning , shall give back the golden hours ,</l>
       <l n="8">Ocean a windless level , Earth a lawn</l>
       <l n="9">Spacious and full of sunlit dancing-places ,</l>
       <l n="10">And laughter , and music , and , among the flowers ,</l>

    <head>NOTE</head>
    <p n="1">The Appendix contains : ( 1 ) the only two coherent fragments found in the notebook which Brooke used in the last month of his life ; a little song , written , I think on his travels ; and a poem , dating probably from 1912 , which for some reason he left unrevised ; ( 2 ) a few “ lighter ” poems which I dare say he would have printed on their merits if he had published a volume in which they would not have been out of key . Two of these , the “ Letter to a Live Poet ” and “ The Little Dog 's Day , ” were written for Westminster Gazette competitions , in which they won prizes . Edward Marsh</p>
    <p n="2">Fragment</p>
    <p n="3">I strayed about the deck , an hour , to-night Under a cloudy moonless sky ; and peeped In at the windows , watched my friends at table , In the windows , watched my friends at table , Or playing cards , or standing in the doorway , Or coming out into the darkness . Still No one could see me .</p>
    <p n="4">I would have thought of them — Heedless , within a week of battle — in pity , Pride in their strength and in the weight and firmness And link 'd beauty of bodies , and pity that This gay machine of splendour ‘ ld soon be broken , Thought little of , pashed , scattered , . . .</p>
    <p n="5">Only , always , I could but see them — against the lamplight — pass Like coloured shadows , thinner than filmy glass , Slight bubbles , fainter than the wave 's faint light , That broke to phosphorus out in the night , Perishing things and strange ghosts — soon to die To other ghosts — this one , or that or I .</p>
    <p n="6">April 1915 .</p>
    <p n="7">The Dance</p>
    <p n="8">A Song</p>
    <p n="9">As the Wind , and as the Wind , In a corner of the way , Goes stepping , stands twirling , Invisibly , comes whirling , Bows before , and skips behind , In a grave , an endless play —</p>
    <p n="10">So my Heart , and so my Heart , Following where your feet have gone , Stirs dust of old dreams there ; He turns a toe ; he gleams there , Treading you a dance apart . But you see not . You pass on .</p>
    <p n="11">April 1915 .</p>
    <p n="12">Song</p>
    <p n="13">The way of love was thus . He was born one winter morn With hands delicious , And it was well with us .</p>
    <p n="14">Love came our quiet way , Lit pride in us , and died in us , All in a winter 's day . There is no more to say .</p>
    <p n="15">1913 (? ) .</p>
    <p n="16">Sometimes Even Now . . .</p>
    <p n="17">Sometimes even now I may Steal a prisoner 's holiday , Slip , when all is worst , the bands , Hurry back , and duck beneath Time 's old tyrannous groping hands , Speed away with laughing breath Back to all I 'll never know , Back to you , a year ago .</p>
    <p n="18">Truant there from Time and Pain , What I had , I find again : Sunlight in the boughs above , Sunlight in your hair and dress , The hands too proud for all but Love , The Lips of utter kindliness , The Heart of bravery swift and clean Where the best was safe , I knew , And laughter in the gold and green , And song , and friends , and ever you With smiling and familiar eyes , You — but friendly : you — but true .</p>
    <p n="19">And Innocence accounted wise , And Faith the fool , the pitiable . Love so rare , one would swear All of earth for ever well —</p>
    <p n="20">Careless lips and flying hair , And little things I may not tell .</p>
    <p n="21">It does but double the heart-ache When I wake , when I wake .</p>
    <p n="22">1912 (? ) .</p>
    <p n="23">Sonnet : in Time of Revolt</p>
    <p n="24">The Thing must End . I am no boy ! I am No BOY ! I being twenty-one . Uncle , you make A great mistake , a very great mistake , In chiding me for letting slip a “ Damn ! ” What 's more , you called me “ Mother 's one ewe lamb , ” Bade me “ refrain from swearing — for her sake — Till I 'm grown up ” . . . — By God ! I think you take Too much upon you , Uncle William !</p>
    <p n="25">You say I am your brother 's only son . I know it . And , “ What of it ? ” I reply . My heart 's resolved . Something must be done . So shall I curb , so baffle , so suppress This too avuncular officiousness , Intolerable consanguinity .</p>
    <p n="26">January 1908 .</p>
    <p n="27">A Letter to a Live Poet</p>
    <p n="28">Sir , since the last Elizabethan died , Or , rather , that more Paradisal muse , Blind with much light , passed to the light more glorious Or deeper blindness , no man 's hand , as thine , Has , on the world 's most noblest chord of song , Struck certain magic strains . Ears satiate With the clamorous , timorous whisperings of to-day , Thrilled to perceive once more the spacious voice And serene utterance of old . We heard — With rapturous breath half-held , as a dreamer dreams Who dares not know it dreaming , lest he wake — The odorous , amorous style of poetry , The melancholy knocking of those lines , The long , low soughing of pentameters , — Or the sharp of rhyme as a bird 's cry — And the innumerable truant polysyllables Multitudinously twittering like a bee . Fulfilled our hearts were with that music then , And all the evenings sighed it to the dawn , And all the lovers heard it from all the trees . All of the accents upon all the norms ! — And ah ! the stress on the penultimate ! We never knew blank verse could have such feet .</p>
    <p n="29">Where is it now ? Oh , more than ever , now I sometimes think no poetry is read Save where some sepultured Caesura bled , Royally incarnadining all the line . Is the imperial iamb laid to rest , And the young trochee , having done enough ?</p>
    <p n="30">Ah ! turn again ! Sing so to us , who are sick Of seeming-simple rhymes , bizarre emotions , Decked in the simple verses of the day , Infinite meaning in the little gloom , Irregular thoughts in stanzas regular , Modern despair in antique meters , myths Incomprehensible at evening , And symbols that mean nothing in the dawn . The slow lines swell . The new styles sighs . The Celt Moans round with many voices .</p>
    <p n="31">God ! to see Gaunt anapaests stand up out of the verse , Combative accents , stress where no stress should be , Spondee on spondee , iamb on choriamb , The thrill of the all the tribrachs in the world , And all the vowels rising to the E ! To hear the blessed mutter of those verbs , Conjunctions passionate toward each other 's arms , And epithets like amaranthine lovers Stretching luxuriously to the stars , All prouder pronouns than the dawn , and all The thunder of the trumpets of the noun !</p>
    <p n="32">January 1911 .</p>
    <p n="33">Fragment on Painters</p>
    <p n="34">There is an evil which that Race attaints Who represent God 's World with oily paints , Who mock the Universe , so rare and sweet , With spots of colour on a canvas sheet , Defile the Lovely and insult the Good By scrawling upon little bits of wood . They 'd snare the moon , and catch the immortal sun With madder brown and pale vermilion , Entrap an English evening 's magic hush . . .</p>
    <p n="35">The True Beatitude ( Bouts-Rimes )</p>
    <p n="36">They say when the Great Prompter 's hand shall ring Down the last curtain upon earth and sea , All the Good Mimes will have eternity To praise their Author , worship love and sing ; Or to the walls of Heaven wandering Look down on those damned for a fretful d ——, Mock them ( all theologians agree On this reward for virtue ) , laugh , and fling</p>
    <p n="37">New sulphur on the sin-incarnadined . . . Ah , Love ! still temporal , and still atmospheric , Teleologically unperturbed , We share a peace by no divine divined , An earthly garden hidden from any cleric , Untrodden of God , by no Eternal curbed .</p>
    <p n="38">1913 .</p>
    <p n="39">Sonnet Reversed</p>
    <p n="40">Hand trembling towards hand ; the amazing lights Of heart and eye . They stood on supreme heights .</p>
    <p n="41">Ah , the delirious weeks of honeymoon ! Soon they returned , and after strange adventures , Settled at Balham by the end of June , Their money was in Can . Pacs . B . Debentures , And in Antofagastas . Still he went Cityward daily ; still she did abide At home . And both were really quite content With work and social pleasures . Then they died . They left three children ( beside George , who drank ) ; The eldest Jane , who married Mr. Bell , William , the head-clerk in the County Bank , And Henry , a stock-broker , doing well .</p>
    <p n="42">Lulworth , 1 January 1911 .</p>
    <p n="43">It 's Not Going to Happen Again</p>
    <p n="44">I have known the most dear that is granted us here , More supreme than the gods know above , Like a star I was hurled through the sweet of the world , And the height and the light of it , Love . I have risen to the uttermost Heaven of Joy , I have sunk to the sheer Hell of Pain — But — it 's not going to happen again , my boy , It 's not going to happen again .</p>
    <p n="45">It 's the very first word that poor Juliet heard From her Romeo over the Styx ; And the Roman will tell Cleopatra in hell When she starts her immortal old tricks ; What Paris was tellin ’ for good-bye to Helen When he bundled her into the train — Oh , it 's not going to happen again , old girl , It 's not going to happen again .</p>
    <p n="46">Chateau Lake Louise , Canada , 1913 .</p>
    <p n="47">The Little Dog 's Day</p>
    <p n="48">All in the town were still asleep , When the sun came up with a shout and a leap . In the lonely streets unseen by man , A little dog danced . And the day began .</p>
    <p n="49">All his life he 'd been good , as far as he could , And the poor little beast had done all that he should . But this morning he swore , by Odin and Thor And the Canine Valhalla — he 'd stand it no more !</p>
    <p n="50">So his prayer he got granted — to do just what he wanted , Prevented by none , for the space of one day . “ Jam incipiebo<span corresp="#note1" type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>, sedere facebo<span corresp="#note2" type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>, ” In dog-Latin he quoth , “ Euge ! sophos ! hurray ! ”</p>
    <p n="51">He fought with the he-dogs , and winked at the she-dogs , A thing that had never been heard of before . “ For the stigma of gluttony , I care not a button ! ” he Cried , and ate all he could swallow — and more .</p>
    <p n="52">He took sinewy lumps from the shins of old frumps , And mangled the errand-boys — when he could get ‘ em . He shammed furious rabies , and bit all the babies<span corresp="#note3" type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>, And followed the cats up the trees , and then ate ’ em !</p>
    <p n="53">They thought ‘ twas the devil was holding a revel , And sent for the parson to drive him away ; For the town never knew such a hullabaloo As that little dog raised — till the end of that day .</p>
    <p n="54">When the blood-red sun had gone burning down , And the lights were lit in the little town , Outside , in the gloom of the twilight grey , The little dog died when he 'd had his day .</p>
