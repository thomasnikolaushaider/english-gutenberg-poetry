No gleam of rose or amethyst Hallowed the parting day ; A shroud , a shroud of awful grey Wrapped every woodland brow , And drooped in crumbling disarray Around each wintry bough .</titlePart></docTitle>

   <p>We had caught our god , and we got him aboard ere he woke ( he was more than a little heavy ) ; Glittering , beautiful , flushed he lay in the lurching bows of the old black barque , As the sunset died and the white moon dawned , and we saw on the island a star-bright bevy Of naked Bacchanals stealing to watch through the whispering vines in the purple dark !</p>

   </lg>
   <p>Beautiful under the sailing moon , in the tangled net , with the leopards beside him , Snared like a wild young red-lipped merman , wilful , petulant , flushed he lay ; While Silver and Hook in their big sea-boots and their boat-cloaks guarded and gleefully eyed him , Thinking what Bacchus might do for a seaman , like standing him drinks , as a man might say .</p>

   <p>All the grog that ever was heard of , gods , was it stowed in our sure possession ? O , the pictures that broached the skies and poured their colours across our dreams ! O , the thoughts that tapped the sunset , and rolled like a great torchlight procession Down our throats in a glory of glories , a roaring splendour of golden streams !</p>

   <p>Beautiful , white , at the break of day , He woke and , the net in a smoke dissolving , He rose like a flame , with his yellow-eyed pards and his flame-red hair like a windy dawn , And the crew kept back , respectful like , till the leopards advanced with their eyes revolving , Then up the rigging went Silver and Hook , and the rest of us followed with case-knives drawn .</p>

He turns to the window , peers through it for a moment , then suddenly unwinds a scarf from his neck , ties it to one of the bars and stands to one side .</note>

The fairy glade in Sherwood begins to be visible in the gloom by the soft light of the ivory gates which are swinging open once more among the ferns . As the scene grows clearer the song of SHADOW-OF-A-LEAF grows more and more triumphant and is gradually caught up by the chorus of the fairy host within the woods .</note>

      <l n="560">With their stage-practice . “ And no risk ? ” breathed Bame ,</l>
      <l n="561">“ No risk at all ? ” “ O , sir , no risk at all !</l>
      <l n="562">We make the very coins . Besides , that part</l>
      <l n="563">Touches not you . Yours is the honest face ,</l>
      <l n="564">That 's all we want . ”</l>
      <l n="565">“ Why , sir , if you be sure</l>
      <l n="566">There is no risk ... ”</l>
      <l n="567">“ You 'll help to spend it . Good !</l>
      <l n="568">We 'll talk anon of this , and you shall carry</l>
      <l n="569">More angels in your pocket , master Bame ,</l>
      <l n="570">Than e'er you 'll meet in heaven . Set hand on seal</l>
      <l n="571">To this now , master Bame , to prove your faith .</l>
      <l n="572">Come , all have signed it . Here 's the quill , dip , write .</l>
      <l n="573">Good ! ”</l>
      <l n="574">And Kit , pocketing the paper , bowed</l>
      <l n="575">The gull to the inn-door , saying as he went ,—</l>
      <l n="576">“ You shall hear further when the plan 's complete .</l>
      <l n="577">But there 's one great condition — not one word ,</l>
      <l n="578">One breath of scandal more on Robert Greene .</l>
      <l n="579">He 's dead ; but he was one of us . The day</l>
      <l n="580">You air his shirt , I air this paper , too . ”</l>
      <l n="581">No gleam of understanding , even then ,</l>
      <l n="582">Illumed that long white face : no stage , indeed ,</l>
      <l n="583">Has known such acting as the Mermaid Inn</l>
      <l n="584">That night , and Bame but sniggered , “ Why , of course ,</l>
      <l n="585">There 's good in all men ; and the best of us</l>
      <l n="586">Will make mistakes . ”</l>
      <l n="587">“ But no mistakes in this , ”</l>
      <l n="588">Said Kit , “ or all together we shall swing</l>
      <l n="589">At Tyburn — who knows what may leap to light ?—</l>
      <l n="590">You understand ? No scandal ! ” “ Not a breath ! ”</l>
      <l n="591">So , in dead silence , Master Richard Bame</l>
      <l n="592">Went out into the darkness and the night ,</l>
      <l n="593">To ask , as I have heard , for many a moon ,</l>
      <l n="594">The price of malmsey-butts and silken hose ,</l>
      <l n="595">And doublets slashed with satin .</l>
      <l n="596">As the door</l>
      <l n="597">Slammed on his back , the pent-up laughter burst</l>
      <l n="598">With echo and re-echo round the room ,</l>
      <l n="599">But ceased as Will tossed on the glowing hearth</l>
      <l n="600">The last poor Testament of Robert Greene .</l>
      <l n="601">All watched it burn . The black wind wailed and moaned</l>
      <l n="602">Around the Mermaid as the sparks flew up .</l>
      <l n="603">“ God , what a night for ships upon the sea , ”</l>
      <l n="604">Said Raleigh , peering through the wet black panes ,</l>
      <l n="605">“ Well — we may thank Him for the Little Red Ring ! ”</l>
      <l n="606">“ The Little Red Ring , ” cried Kit , “ the Little Red Ring ! ”</l>

     <l n="6">For Shakespeare 's eye , like white sheets in the sun .</l>
     <l n="7">Marlowe , our morning-star , and Michael Drayton</l>

     <l n="305">No worse . He felt the heat . He felt the cold .</l>
     <l n="306">He took her down to Deptford to escape</l>
     <l n="307">Contagion , and the crashing of sextons ’ spades</l>

   <p>THE COMPANION OF A MILE</p>
   <p>THWACK ! Thwack ! One early dawn upon our door I heard the bladder of some motley fool Bouncing , and all the dusk of London shook With bells ! I leapt from bed ,— had I forgotten ?— I flung my casement wide and craned my neck Over the painted Mermaid . There he stood , His right leg yellow and his left leg blue , With jingling cap , a sheep-bell at his tail , Wielding his eel-skin bladder ,— bang ! thwack ! bang !— Catching a comrade 's head with the recoil And skipping away ! All Bread Street dimly burned Like a reflected sky , green , red and white With littered branches , ferns and hawthorn-clouds ; For , round Sir Fool , a frolic morrice-troop Of players , poets , prentices , mad-cap queans , Robins and Marians , coloured like the dawn , And sparkling like the greenwood whence they came With their fresh boughs all dewy from the dark , Clamoured , Come down ! Come down , and let us in ! High over these , I suddenly saw Sir Fool Leap to a sign-board , swing to a conduit-head , And perch there , gorgeous on the morning sky , Tossing his crimson cockscomb to the blue And crowing like Chanticleer , Give them a rouse ! Tickle it , tabourer ! Nimbly , lasses , nimbly ! Tuck up your russet petticoats and dance ! Let the Cheape know it is the first of May !</p>
   <p>And as I seized shirt , doublet and trunk-hose , I saw the hobby-horse come cantering down , A pasteboard steed , dappled a rosy white Like peach-bloom , bridled with purple , bitted with gold , A crimson foot-cloth on his royal flanks , And , riding him , His Majesty of the May ! Round him the whole crowd frolicked with a shout , And as I stumbled down the crooked stair I heard them break into a dance and sing :—</p>

      <l n="53">His nine-days ’ wonder , through the countryside</l>

      <l n="57">His anticks for himself and , in his games ,</l>
      <l n="58">Was more than most May-fools fantastical .</l>
      <l n="59">I watched his thin face , as he rocked and crooned ,</l>

     <l n="201">Of courtly favour . Mark my words now , Ben ,</l>

     <l n="203">By skilful tacking . But you run it fine ,</l>
     <l n="204">Selden , you run it fine . Take my advice</l>

     <l n="206">Or even the King will see it . ”</l>
     <l n="207">He chuckled again .</l>
     <l n="208">“ But tell them of your tractate ! ”</l>
     <l n="209">“ Here it is , ”</l>
     <l n="210">Quoth Selden , twisting a lighted paper spill ,</l>
     <l n="211">Then , with his round cherubic face aglow</l>
     <l n="212">Lit his long silver pipe ,</l>
     <l n="213">“ Why , first , ” he said ,</l>
     <l n="214">“ Camden being Clarencieux King-at-arms ,</l>
     <l n="215">He read the King this little tract I wrote</l>
     <l n="216">Against tobacco . ” And the Mermaid roared</l>
     <l n="217">With laughter . “ Well , you went the way to hang</l>
     <l n="218">All three of them , ” cried Lyly , “ and , as for Ben ,</l>
     <l n="219">His Trinidado goes to bed with him . ”</l>
     <l n="220">“ Green gosling , quack no more , ” Selden replied ,</l>
     <l n="221">Smiling that rosy silken smile anew .</l>
     <l n="222">“ The King 's a critic ! When have critics known</l>
     <l n="223">The poet from his creatures , God from me ?</l>
     <l n="224">How many cite Polonius to their sons</l>

     <l n="228">Camden read it out</l>
     <l n="229">Without the flicker of an eye . His beard</l>
     <l n="230">Saved us , I think . The King admired his text .</l>

     <l n="234">‘ God bless my soul ,</l>
     <l n="235">A bushel of soot ! Think of it ! ’ said the King .</l>
     <l n="236">‘ The man who wrote those great and splendid words , ’</l>
     <l n="237">Camden replied ,— I had prepared his case</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="33">
     <l n="240">‘ Ah , ’ said the shrewd King , goggling his great eyes</l>
     <l n="241">Cannily . ‘ Did he not defame the Scots ? ’</l>
     <l n="242">‘ That 's true , ’ said Camden , like a man that hears</l>
     <l n="243">Truth for the first time . ‘ O ay , he defamed ‘ em , ’</l>
     <l n="244">The King said , very wisely , once again .</l>
     <l n="245">‘ Ah , but , ’ says Camden , like a man that strives</l>
     <l n="246">With more than mortal wit , ‘ only such Scots</l>
     <l n="247">As flout your majesty , and take tobacco .</l>
     <l n="248">He is a Scot , himself , and hath the gift</l>
     <l n="249">Of preaching . ’ Then we gave him Jonson 's lines</l>
     <l n="250">Against Virginia . ‘ Neither do thou lust</l>

     <l n="252">Before the gathering and the making up ,</l>
     <l n="253">What alligarta may have spawned thereon , ’</l>
     <l n="254">Or words to that effect .</l>
     <l n="255">‘ Magneeficent ! ’</l>
     <l n="256">Spluttered the King — ‘ who knows ? Who knows , indeed ?</l>
     <l n="257">That 's a grand touch , that Alligarta , Camden ! ’</l>
     <l n="258">‘ The Scot who wrote those great and splendid words , ’</l>
     <l n="259">Said Camden , ‘ languishes in Newgate , sire .</l>
     <l n="260">His ears and nose — ’</l>
     <l n="261">And there , as we arranged</l>
     <l n="262">With Inigo Jones , the ladies of the court</l>
     <l n="263">Assailed the King in tears . Their masque and ball</l>
     <l n="264">Would all be ruined . All their Grecian robes ,</l>
     <l n="265">Procured at vast expense , were wasted now .</l>
     <l n="266">The masque was not half-written . Master Jones</l>
     <l n="267">Had lost his poets . They were all in gaol .</l>
     <l n="268">Their noses and their ears ...</l>
     <l n="269">‘ God bless my soul , ’</l>
     <l n="270">Spluttered the King , goggling his eyes again ,</l>
     <l n="271">‘ What d'you make of it , Camden ? ’ —</l>
     <l n="272">‘ I should say</l>
     <l n="273">A Puritan plot , sire ; for these justices —</l>

     <l n="276">If this continue , sire , there 'll not be left</l>
     <l n="277">A loyal ear or nose in all your realm . ’</l>
     <l n="278">At that , our noble monarch well-nigh swooned .</l>
     <l n="279">He hunched his body , padded as it was</l>
     <l n="280">Against the assassin 's knife , six inches deep</l>
     <l n="281">With great green quilts , wagged his enormous head ,</l>
     <l n="282">Then , in a dozen words , he wooed destruction :</l>
     <l n="283">‘ It is presumption and a high contempt</l>
     <l n="284">In subjects to dispute what kings can do , ’</l>
     <l n="285">He whimpered . ‘ Even as it is blasphemy</l>
     <l n="286">To thwart the will of God . ’</l>
     <l n="287">He waved his hand ,</l>
     <l n="288">And rose . ‘ These men must be released , at once ! ’</l>
     <l n="289">Then , as I think , to seek a safer place ,</l>
     <l n="290">He waddled from the room , his rickety legs</l>
     <l n="291">Doubling beneath that great green feather-bed</l>
     <l n="292">He calls his ‘ person . ’ — I shall dream to-night</l>
     <l n="293">Of spiders , Camden .— But in half an hour ,</l>
     <l n="294">Inigo Jones was armed with Right Divine</l>
     <l n="295">To save such ears and noses as the ball</l>
     <l n="296">Required for its perfection . Think of that !</l>
     <l n="297">And let this earthly ball remember , too ,</l>
     <l n="298">That Chapman , Marston , and our great big Ben</l>
     <l n="299">Owe their poor adjuncts to — ten Grecian robes</l>
     <l n="300">And ‘ Jonson ’ on tobacco ! England loves</l>

     <l n="302">“ But Ben has narrowly escaped her love , ”</l>
     <l n="303">Said Chapman gravely .</l>
     <l n="304">“ What do you mean ? ” said Lodge .</l>
     <l n="305">And , as he spoke , there was a sudden hush .</l>
     <l n="306">A tall gaunt woman with great burning eyes ,</l>
     <l n="307">And white hair blown back softly from a face</l>
     <l n="308">Ethereally fierce , as might have looked</l>
     <l n="309">Cassandra in old age , stood at the door .</l>
     <l n="310">“ Where is my Ben ? ” she said .</l>
     <l n="311">“ Mother ! ” cried Ben .</l>
     <l n="312">He rose and caught her in his mighty arms .</l>
     <l n="313">Her labour-reddened , long-boned hands entwined</l>
     <l n="314">Behind his neck .</l>
     <l n="315">“ She brought this to the gaol , ”</l>
     <l n="316">Said Chapman quietly , tossing a phial across</l>
     <l n="317">To Camden . “ And he meant to take it , too ,</l>
     <l n="318">Before the hangman touched him . Half an hour</l>
     <l n="319">And you 'd have been too late to save big Ben .</l>

     <l n="323">I think she had another for herself . ”</l>
     <l n="324">“ There 's Roman blood in both of them , ” said Dekker ,</l>
     <l n="325">“ Do n't look . She is weeping now , ” And , while Ben held</l>
     <l n="326">That gaunt old body sobbing against his heart ,</l>
     <l n="327">Dekker , to make her think they paid no heed ,</l>
     <l n="328">Began to sing ; and very softly now .</l>

     <l n="7">Over the roaring hearth , puffed at his pipe ;</l>
     <l n="8">A little sad , as often I found him now</l>
     <l n="9">Remembering vanished faces . Yet the years</l>
     <l n="10">Brought others round him . Wreaths of Heliochrise</l>
     <l n="11">Gleamed still in that great tribe of Benjamin ,</l>
     <l n="12">Burned still across the malmsey and muscadel .</l>
     <l n="13">Chapman and Browne , Herrick ,— a name like thyme</l>
     <l n="14">Crushed into sweetness by a bare-foot maid</l>
     <l n="15">Milking , at dewy dawn , in Elfin-land ,—</l>
     <l n="16">These three came late , and sat in a little room</l>
     <l n="17">Aside , supping together , on one great pie ,</l>
     <l n="18">Whereof both crust and coffin were prepared</l>
     <l n="19">By master Herrick 's receipt , and all washed down</l>
     <l n="20">With mighty cups of sack . This left with Ben ,</l>
     <l n="21">John Ford , wrapped in his cloak , brooding aloof ,</l>
     <l n="22">Drayton and Lodge and Drummond of Hawthornden .</l>
     <l n="23">Suddenly , in the porch , I heard a sound</l>
     <l n="24">Of iron that grated on the flags . A spade</l>
     <l n="25">And pick came edging through the door .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="26">“ O , room !</l>
     <l n="27">Room for the master-craftsman , ” muttered Ford ,</l>
     <l n="28">And grey old sexton Scarlet hobbled in .</l>
     <l n="29">He shuffled off the snow that clogged his boots ,</l>
     <l n="30">— On my clean rushes !— brushed it from his cloak</l>
     <l n="31">Of Northern Russet , wiped his rheumatic knees ,</l>
     <l n="32">Blew out his lanthorn , hung it on a nail ,</l>
     <l n="33">Leaned his rude pick and spade against the wall ,</l>
     <l n="34">Flung back his rough frieze hood , flapped his gaunt arms ,</l>
     <l n="35">And called for ale .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="36">“ Come to the fire , ” said Lodge .</l>
     <l n="37">“ Room for the wisest counsellor of kings ,</l>
     <l n="38">The kindly sage that puts us all to bed ,</l>
     <l n="39">And tucks us up beneath the grass-green quilt . ”</l>
     <l n="40">“ Plenty of work , eh Timothy ? ” said Ben .</l>
     <l n="41">“ Work ? Where 's my liquor ? O , ay , there 's work to spare , ”</l>
     <l n="42">Old Scarlet croaked , then quaffed his creaming stoup ,</l>
     <l n="43">While Ben said softly — “ Pity you could not spare ,</l>
     <l n="44">You and your Scythe-man , some of the golden lads</l>
     <l n="45">That I have seen here in the Mermaid Inn ! ”</l>
     <l n="46">Then , with a quiet smile he shook his head</l>
     <l n="47">And turned to master Drummond of Hawthornden .</l>
     <l n="48">“ Well , songs are good ; but flesh and blood are better .</l>
     <l n="49">The grey old tomb of Horace glows for me</l>
     <l n="50">Across the centuries , with one little fire</l>
     <l n="51">Lit by a girl 's light hand . ” Then , under breath ,</l>
     <l n="52">Yet with some passion , he murmured this brief rhyme :—</l>

      <l n="67">I 'd keep it up all night with ancient ballads . ”</l>
      <l n="68">And then — a strange thing happened . I saw John Ford</l>
      <l n="69">“ With folded arms and melancholy hat ”</l>
      <l n="70">( As in our Mermaid jest he still would sit )</l>
      <l n="71">Watching old Scarlet like a man in trance .</l>
      <l n="72">The sexton gulped his ale and smacked his lips ,</l>
      <l n="73">Then croaked again — “ O , ay , there 's work to spare ,</l>
      <l n="74">We fills ‘ em faster than the spades can dig , ”</l>
      <l n="75">And , all at once , the lights burned low and blue .</l>
      <l n="76">Ford leaned right forward , with his grim black eyes</l>
      <l n="77">Widening .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="8">
      <l n="78">“ Why , that 's a marvellous ring ! ” he said ,</l>
      <l n="79">And pointed to the sexton 's gnarled old hand</l>
      <l n="80">Spread on the black oak-table like the claw</l>
      <l n="81">Of some great bird of prey . “ A ruby worth</l>
      <l n="82">The ransom of a queen ! ” The fire leapt up !</l>
      <l n="83">The sexton stared at him ;</l>
      <l n="84">Then stretched his hand out , with its blue-black nails ,</l>
      <l n="85">Full in the light , a grim earth-coloured hand ,</l>
      <l n="86">But bare as it was born .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="9">
      <l n="87">“ There was a ring !</l>
      <l n="88">I could have sworn it ! Red as blood ! ” cried Ford .</l>
      <l n="89">And Ben and Lodge and Drummond of Hawthornden</l>
      <l n="90">All stared at him . For such a silent soul</l>
      <l n="91">Was master Ford that , when he suddenly spake ,</l>
      <l n="92">It struck the rest as dumb as if the Sphinx</l>
      <l n="93">Had opened its cold stone lips . He would sit mute</l>
      <l n="94">Brooding , aloof , for hours , his cloak around him ,</l>
      <l n="95">A staff between his knees , as if prepared</l>
      <l n="96">For a long journey , a lonely pilgrimage</l>
      <l n="97">To some dark tomb ; a strange and sorrowful soul ,</l>
      <l n="98">Yet not — as many thought him — harsh or hard ,</l>
      <l n="99">But of a most kind patience . Though he wrote</l>
      <l n="100">In blood , they say , the blood came from his heart ;</l>
      <l n="101">And all the sufferings of this world he took</l>
      <l n="102">To his own soul , and bade them pasture there :</l>
      <l n="103">Till out of his compassion , he became</l>
      <l n="104">A monument of bitterness . He rebelled ;</l>
      <l n="105">And so fell short of that celestial height</l>
      <l n="106">Whereto the greatest only climb , who stand</l>
      <l n="107">By Shakespeare , and accept the Eternal Law .</l>
      <l n="108">These find , in law , firm footing for the soul ,</l>
      <l n="109">The strength that binds the stars , and reins the sea ,</l>
      <l n="110">The base of being , the pillars of the world ,</l>
      <l n="111">The pledge of honour , the pure cord of love ,</l>
      <l n="112">The form of truth , the golden floors of heaven .</l>
      <l n="113">These men discern a height beyond all heights ,</l>
      <l n="114">A depth below all depths , and never an end</l>
      <l n="115">Without a pang beyond it , and a hope ;</l>
      <l n="116">Without a heaven beyond it , and a hell .</l>
      <l n="117">For these , despair is like a bubble pricked ,</l>
      <l n="118">An old romance to make young lovers weep .</l>
      <l n="119">For these , the law becomes a fiery road ,</l>
      <l n="120">A Jacob 's ladder through that vast abyss</l>
      <l n="121">Lacking no rung from realm to loftier realm ,</l>
      <l n="122">Nor wanting one degree from dust to wings .</l>
      <l n="123">These , at the last , radiant with victory ,</l>
      <l n="124">Lay their strong hands upon the wingèd steeds</l>
      <l n="125">And fiery chariots , and exult to hold ,</l>
      <l n="126">Themselves , the throbbing reins , whereby they steer</l>
      <l n="127">The stormy splendours .</l>
      <l n="128">He , being less , rebelled ,</l>
      <l n="129">Cried out for unreined steeds , and unruled stars ,</l>
      <l n="130">An unprohibited ocean and a truth</l>
      <l n="131">Untrue ; and the equal thunder of the law</l>
      <l n="132">Hurled him to night and chaos , who was born</l>
      <l n="133">To shine upon the forehead of the day .</l>
      <l n="134">And yet — the voice of darkness and despair</l>
      <l n="135">May speak for heaven where heaven would not be heard ,</l>
      <l n="136">May fight for heaven where heaven would not prevail ,</l>
      <l n="137">And the consummate splendour of that strife ,</l>
      <l n="138">Swallowing up all discords , all defeat ,</l>
      <l n="139">In one huge victory , harmonising all ,</l>
      <l n="140">Make Lucifer , at last , at one with God .</l>

      <l n="157">Most likely someone 's told you that old tale !</l>

      <l n="159">Ford shook his head .</l>
      <l n="160">“ What tale ? ” said Ben .</l>
      <l n="161">“ O , you could make a book</l>

      <l n="166">A white witch told me , if I did , I 'd go</l>

      <l n="168">Whirled in a fiery chariot with ten steeds</l>

      <l n="172">Well ,— I came , sirs , to my craft</l>
      <l n="173">The day mine uncle Robert dug the grave</l>
      <l n="174">For good Queen Katharine , she whose heart was broke</l>
      <l n="175">By old King Harry , a very great while ago .</l>
      <l n="176">Maybe you 've heard about my uncle , sirs ?</l>
      <l n="177">He was far-famous for his grave-digging .</l>
      <l n="178">In depth , in speed , in neatness , he 'd no match !</l>
      <l n="179">They 've put a fine slab to his memory</l>
      <l n="180">In Peterborough Cathedral — Robert Scarlet ,</l>
      <l n="181">Sexton for half a century , it says ,</l>
      <l n="182">In Peterborough Cathedral , where he built</l>
      <l n="183">The last sad habitation for two queens ,</l>
      <l n="184">And many hundreds of the common sort .</l>
      <l n="185">And now himself , who for so many built</l>
      <l n="186">Eternal habitations , others have buried .</l>
      <l n="187">Obiit anno ætatis , ninety-eight ,</l>
      <l n="188">July the second , fifteen ninety-four .</l>
      <l n="189">We should do well , sir , with a slab like that ,</l>

      <l n="191">“ Not many boasts a finer slab than that .</l>
      <l n="192">There 's many a king done worse . Ah , well , you see ,</l>
      <l n="193">He 'd a fine record . Living to ninety-eight ,</l>
      <l n="194">He buried generations of the poor ,</l>
      <l n="195">A countless host , and thought no more of it</l>
      <l n="196">Than digging potatoes . He 'd a lofty mind</l>
      <l n="197">That found no satisfaction in small deeds .</l>
      <l n="198">But from his burying of two queens he drew</l>
      <l n="199">A lively pleasure . Could he have buried a third ,</l>
      <l n="200">It would indeed have crowned his old white hairs .</l>
      <l n="201">But he was famous , and he thought , perchance ,</l>
      <l n="202">A third were mere vain-glory . So he died .</l>
      <l n="203">I helped him with the second . ”</l>
      <l n="204">The old man leered</l>
      <l n="205">To see the shaft go home .</l>
      <l n="206">Ben filled the stoup</l>
      <l n="207">With ale . “ So that , ” quoth he , “ began the tale</l>

      <l n="209">“ Who was the second queen ? ”</l>
      <l n="210">“ A famous queen ,</l>

      <l n="213">Of modesty , men say , yet — she died young !</l>
      <l n="214">We buried her at midnight . There were few</l>

      <l n="216">Was held upon the morrow , Lammas morn .</l>
      <l n="217">Anon you shall hear why . A strange thing that ,—</l>

      <l n="220">To see us lowering the true coffin down</l>
      <l n="221">By torchlight , with some few of her true friends ,</l>
      <l n="222">In Peterborough Cathedral , all alone . ”</l>
      <l n="223">“ Old as the world , ” said Ford . “ It is the way</l>

      <l n="225">At dead of night , like ghosts raised from the grave !</l>
      <l n="226">And all the luxury of their brief , bright noon ,</l>
      <l n="227">Cloaks but a dummy throne , a mask of life ;</l>

      <l n="230">But tell , tell on ! ”</l>
      <l n="231">The sexton took a draught</l>

      <l n="236">Her royal coach came creeping through the lanes ,</l>
      <l n="237">With scutcheons round it and no crowd to see ,</l>

      <l n="239">And none to admire , but him and me , and one ,</l>
      <l n="240">A pedlar-poet , who lodged with us that week</l>

      <l n="244">Of doom . My uncle thought that he should pay</l>
      <l n="245">Four-pence beside ; but , when the man declared</l>
      <l n="246">The thought unworthy of these august events ,</l>
      <l n="247">My uncle was abashed .</l>
      <l n="248">And , truth to tell ,</l>
      <l n="249">The rhymes were mellow , though here and there he swerved</l>
      <l n="250">From truth to make them so . Nor would he change</l>
      <l n="251">‘ June ’ to ‘ July ’ for all that we could say .</l>
      <l n="252">‘ I never said the month was June , ’ he cried ,</l>
      <l n="253">‘ And if I did , Shakespeare hath jumped an age !</l>
      <l n="254">Gods , will you hedge me round with thirty nights ?</l>
      <l n="255">“ June ” rhymes with “ moon ” ! ’ With that , he flung them down</l>
      <l n="256">And strode away like Lucifer , and was gone ,</l>
      <l n="257">Before old Scarlet could approach again</l>
      <l n="258">The matter of that four-pence .</l>
      <l n="259">Yet his rhymes</l>
      <l n="260">Have caught the very colours of that night !</l>
      <l n="261">I can see through them ,</l>
      <l n="262">Ay , just as through our cottage window-panes ,</l>

      <l n="265">The roses bobbing and fluttering to and fro ,</l>
      <l n="266">Hide , and yet show the more by hiding , half .</l>

      <l n="268">The song shows truest when it blurs the truth .</l>
      <l n="269">This is the way it goes . ”</l>
      <l n="270">He rose to his feet ,</l>
      <l n="271">Picked up his spade , and struck an attitude ,</l>
      <l n="272">Leaning upon it . “ I 've got to feel my spade ,</l>

      <l n="645">‘ Twas growing dusk already , and as I thrust</l>
      <l n="646">The key into the lock , the great grey porch</l>

      <l n="648">I pushed</l>
      <l n="649">Hard at the key — then stopped — with all my flesh</l>
      <l n="650">Freezing , and half in mind to fly ; for , sirs ,</l>
      <l n="651">The door was locked already , and — from within !</l>
      <l n="652">I drew the key forth quietly and stepped back</l>

      <l n="654">With sunset still , and the blunt carven stones</l>
      <l n="655">Lengthened their homely shadows , out and out ,</l>
      <l n="656">To Everlasting . Then I plucked up heart ,</l>
      <l n="657">Seeing the footprints of that mighty Masque</l>
      <l n="658">Along the pebbled path . A queer thought came</l>
      <l n="659">Into my head that all the world without</l>
      <l n="660">Was but a Masque , and I was creeping back ,</l>
      <l n="661">Back from the Mourner 's Feast to Truth again .</l>
      <l n="662">Yet — I grew bold , and tried the Southern door .</l>
      <l n="663">‘ Twas locked , but held no key on the inner side</l>
      <l n="664">To foil my own , and softly , softly , click ,</l>
      <l n="665">I turned it , and with heart , sirs , in my mouth ,</l>
      <l n="666">Pushed back the studded door and entered in ...</l>
      <l n="667">Stepped straight out of the world , I might have said ,</l>
      <l n="668">Out of the dusk into a night so deep ,</l>
      <l n="669">So dark , I trembled like a child ....</l>
      <l n="670">And then</l>
      <l n="671">I was aware , sirs , of a great sweet wave</l>
      <l n="672">Of incense . All the gloom was heavy with it ,</l>
      <l n="673">As if her Papist Household had returned</l>
      <l n="674">To pray for her poor soul ; and , my fear went .</l>
      <l n="675">But either that strange incense weighed me down ,</l>
      <l n="676">Or else from being sorely over-tasked ,</l>
      <l n="677">A languor came upon me , and sitting there</l>
      <l n="678">To breathe a moment , in a velvet stall ,</l>
      <l n="679">I closed mine eyes .</l>
      <l n="680">A moment , and no more ,</l>
      <l n="681">For then I heard a rustling in the nave ,</l>
      <l n="682">And opened them ; and , very far away ,</l>
      <l n="683">As if across the world , in Rome herself ,</l>
      <l n="684">I saw twelve tapers in the solemn East ,</l>
      <l n="685">And saw , or thought I saw , cowled figures kneel</l>
      <l n="686">Before them , in an incense-cloud .</l>
      <l n="687">And then ,</l>
      <l n="688">Maybe the sunset deepened in the world</l>
      <l n="689">Of masques without — clear proof that I had closed</l>
      <l n="690">Mine eyes but for a moment , sirs , I saw</l>
      <l n="691">As if across a world-without-end tomb ,</l>
      <l n="692">A tiny jewelled glow of crimson panes</l>
      <l n="693">Darkening and brightening with the West .</l>
      <l n="694">And then ,</l>
      <l n="695">Then I saw something more — Queen Mary 's vault ,</l>
      <l n="696">And — it was open !...</l>
      <l n="697">Then , I heard a voice ,</l>
      <l n="698">A strange deep broken voice , whispering love</l>
      <l n="699">In soft French words , that clasped and clung like hands ;</l>
      <l n="700">And then — two shadows passed against the West ,</l>
      <l n="701">Two blurs of black against that crimson stain ,</l>
      <l n="702">Slowly , O very slowly , with bowed heads ,</l>
      <l n="703">Leaning together , and vanished into the dark</l>
      <l n="704">Beyond the Catafalque .</l>
      <l n="705">Then — I heard him pray ,—</l>
      <l n="706">And knew him for the man that prayed to me ,—</l>
      <l n="707">Pray as a man prays for his love 's last breath !</l>
      <l n="708">And then , O sirs , it caught me by the throat ,</l>
      <l n="709">And I , too , dropped upon my knees and prayed ;</l>
      <l n="710">For , as in answer to his prayer , there came</l>
      <l n="711">A moan of music , a mighty shuddering sound</l>
      <l n="712">From the great organ , a sound that rose and fell</l>
      <l n="713">Like seas in anger , very far away ;</l>
      <l n="714">And then a peal of thunder , and then it seemed ,</l>
      <l n="715">As if the graves were giving up their dead ,</l>
      <l n="716">A great cowled host of shadows rose and sang ;—</l>

      <l n="732">Even as a Mother gathers up her babe ,</l>
      <l n="733">Soothed it against her breast , and rained her tears</l>

      <l n="736">The music died away . The shadows knelt .</l>

      <l n="835">Well , sirs , that dark tide rose within my brain !</l>
      <l n="836">I snatched his keys and flung them over the hedge ,</l>
      <l n="837">Then flung myself down on a bank of ferns</l>
      <l n="838">And wept and wept and wept .</l>
      <l n="839">It puzzled him .</l>
      <l n="840">Perchance he feared my mind was going and yet ,</l>
      <l n="841">O , sirs , if you consider it rightly now ,</l>
      <l n="842">With all those ages knocking at his doors ,</l>
      <l n="843">With all that custom clamouring for his care ,</l>
      <l n="844">Is it so strange a grave-digger should weep ?</l>
      <l n="845">Well — he was kind enough and heaped my plate</l>
      <l n="846">That night at supper .</l>
      <l n="847">But I could never dig my graves at ease</l>
      <l n="848">In Peterborough Churchyard . So I came</l>
      <l n="849">To London — to St. Mary Magdalen 's .</l>
      <l n="850">And thus , I chanced to drink my ale one night</l>
      <l n="851">Here in the Mermaid Inn . ‘ Twas All Souls ’ Eve ,</l>
      <l n="852">And , on that bench , where master Ford now sits</l>
      <l n="853">Was master Shakespeare —</l>
      <l n="854">Well , the lights burned low ,</l>
      <l n="855">And just like master Ford to-night he leaned</l>
      <l n="856">Suddenly forward . ‘ Timothy , ’ he said ,</l>
      <l n="857">‘ That 's a most marvellous ruby ! ’</l>
      <l n="858">My blood froze !</l>
      <l n="859">I stretched my hand out bare as it was born ;</l>
      <l n="860">And he said nothing , only looked at me .</l>
      <l n="861">Then , seeing my pipe was empty , he bade me fill</l>
      <l n="862">And lit it for me .</l>
      <l n="863">Peach , the astrologer ,</l>
      <l n="864">Was living then ; and that same night I went</l>
      <l n="865">And told him all my trouble about this ring .</l>
      <l n="866">He took my hand in his , and held it — thus —</l>
      <l n="867">Then looked into my face and said this rhyme :—</l>

     <lg type="stanza" n="53">
      <l n="868">The ruby ring , that only three</l>

      <l n="874">Peach was a rogue , some say , and yet he spake</l>
      <l n="875">Most truly about the first , ” the sexton mused ,</l>
      <l n="876">“ For master Shakespeare , though they say in youth</l>
      <l n="877">Outside the theatres , he would hold your horse</l>
      <l n="878">For pence , prospered at last , bought a fine house</l>
      <l n="879">In Stratford , lived there like a squire , they say .</l>
      <l n="880">And here , here he would sit , for all the world</l>
      <l n="881">As he were but a poet ! God bless us all ,</l>
      <l n="882">And then — to think !— he rose to be a squire !</l>
      <l n="883">A deep one , masters ! Well , he lit my pipe ! ”</l>
      <l n="884">“ Why did they bury such a queen by night ? ”</l>
      <l n="885">Said Ford . “ Kings might have wept for her . Did Death</l>
      <l n="886">Play epicure and glutton that so few</l>
      <l n="887">Were bidden to such a feast . Once on a time ,</l>
      <l n="888">I could have wept , myself , to hear a tale</l>
      <l n="889">Of beauty buried in the dark . And hers</l>
      <l n="890">Was loveliness , far , far beyond the common !</l>
      <l n="891">Such beauty should be marble to the touch</l>
      <l n="892">Of time , and clad in purple to amaze</l>
      <l n="893">The moth . But she was kind and soft and fair ,</l>
      <l n="894">A woman , and so she died . But , why the dark ? ”</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="56">
      <l n="895">“ Sir , they gave out the coffin was too heavy</l>
      <l n="896">For gentlemen to bear ! ” — “ For kings to bear ? ”</l>
      <l n="897">Ford flashed at him . The sexton shook his head ,—</l>
      <l n="898">“ Nay ! Gentlemen to bear ! But — the true cause —</l>
      <l n="899">Ah , sir , ‘ tis unbelievable , even to me ,</l>
      <l n="900">A sexton , for a queen so fair of face !</l>

      <l n="904">Of amorous gods , and mighty mirrors , too ,</l>
      <l n="905">Imaging her own softness , night and dawn ,</l>
      <l n="906">When through her sumptuous hair she drew the combs ;</l>
      <l n="907">And like one great white rose-leaf half her breast</l>
      <l n="908">Shone through it , firm as ivory . ”</l>
      <l n="909">“ Ay , ” said Lodge ,</l>
      <l n="910">Murmuring his own rich music under breath ,</l>
      <l n="911">“ About her neck did all the graces throng ,</l>

      <l n="913">“ Well , sir , the weather being hot , they feared</l>
      <l n="914">She would not hold the burying ! ” ...</l>
      <l n="915">“ In some sort , ”</l>
      <l n="916">Ford answered slowly , “ if your tale be true ,</l>
      <l n="917">She did not hold it . Many a knightly crest</l>

     <lg type="stanza" n="57">
      <l n="919">There was a hush , broken by Ben at last ,</l>

     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="58">
      <l n="922">Ford laughed , grimly , and flung an angel down .</l>

      <l n="924">There is thy gold . I will not break the spell ,</l>
      <l n="925">Or thou mayst live to bury us one and all ! ”</l>
      <l n="926">“ And , if I live so long , ” the old man replied ,</l>
      <l n="927">Lighting his lanthorn , “ you may trust me , sirs ,</l>

      <l n="931">He shouldered pick and spade . I opened the door .</l>
      <l n="932">The snow blew in , and , as he shuffled out ,</l>
      <l n="933">There , in the strait dark passage , I could swear</l>
      <l n="934">I saw a spark of red upon his hand ,</l>
      <l n="935">Like a great smouldering ruby .</l>
      <l n="936">I gasped . He stopped .</l>

      <l n="938">“ Twice in a night , ” he said .</l>
      <l n="939">“ Nothing , ” I answered , “ only the lanthorn-light . ”</l>
      <l n="940">He shook his head . “ I 'll tell you something more !</l>

      <l n="946">I watched him go ,</l>
      <l n="947">With glimmering lanthorn up the narrow street ,</l>
      <l n="948">Like one that walked upon the clouds , through snow</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">FLOS MERCATORUM ! On that night of nights</l>
     <l n="2">We drew from out our Mermaid cellarage</l>
     <l n="3">All the old glory of London in one cask</l>
     <l n="4">Of magic vintage . Never a city on earth —</l>
     <l n="5">Rome , Paris , Florence , Bagdad — held for Ben</l>
     <l n="6">The colours of old London ; and , that night ,</l>
     <l n="7">We staved them like a wine , and drank , drank deep !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="8">‘ Twas Master Heywood , whom the Mermaid Inn</l>
     <l n="9">Had dubbed our London laureate , hauled the cask</l>
     <l n="10">Out of its ancient harbourage . “ Ben , ” he cried ,</l>
     <l n="11">Bustling into the room with Dekker and Brome ,</l>
     <l n="12">“ The prentices are up ! ” Ben raised his head</l>
     <l n="13">Out of the chimney-corner where he drowsed ,</l>
     <l n="14">And listened , reaching slowly for his pipe .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="15">“ Clerk of the Bow Bell , ” all along the Cheape</l>
     <l n="16">There came a shout that swelled into a roar .</l>
     <l n="17">“ What ! Will they storm the Mermaid ? ” Heywood laughed ,</l>
     <l n="18">“ They are turning into Bread Street ! ”</l>
     <l n="19">Down they came !</l>
     <l n="20">We heard them hooting round the poor old Clerk —</l>
     <l n="21">“ Clubs ! Clubs ! The rogue would have us work all night !</l>
     <l n="22">He rang ten minutes late ! Fifteen , by Paul 's ! ”</l>
     <l n="23">And over the hubbub rose , like a thin bell ,</l>
     <l n="24">The Clerk 's entreaty — “ Now , good boys , good boys ,</l>
     <l n="25">Children of Cheape , be still , I do beseech you !</l>
     <l n="26">I took some forty winks , but then .... ” A roar</l>
     <l n="27">Of wrathful laughter drowned him — “ Forty winks !</l>
     <l n="28">Remember Black May-day ! We 'll make you wink ! ”</l>
     <l n="29">There was a scuffle , and into the tavern rushed</l>
     <l n="30">Gregory Clopton , Clerk of the Bow Bell ,—</l>
     <l n="31">A tall thin man , with yellow hair a-stream ,</l>
     <l n="32">And blazing eyes .</l>
     <l n="33">“ Hide me , ” he clamoured , “ quick !</l>
     <l n="34">These picaroons will murder me ! ”</l>
     <l n="35">I closed</l>
     <l n="36">The thick oak doors against the coloured storm</l>
     <l n="37">Of prentices in red and green and ray ,</l>
     <l n="38">Saffron and Reading tawny . Twenty clubs</l>
     <l n="39">Drubbed on the panels as I barred them out ;</l>
     <l n="40">And even our walls and shutters could not drown</l>
     <l n="41">Their song that , like a mocking peal of bells ,</l>
     <l n="42">Under our windows , made all Bread Street ring :—</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="43">“ Clerk of the Bow Bell ,</l>
     <l n="44">With the yellow locks ,</l>
     <l n="45">For thy late ringing</l>
     <l n="46">Thy head shall have knocks ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="47">Then Heywood , seeing the Clerk was all a-quake ,</l>
     <l n="48">Went to an upper casement that o'er-looked</l>
     <l n="49">The whole of Bread Street . Heywood knew their ways ,</l>
     <l n="50">And parleyed with them till their anger turned</l>
     <l n="51">To shouts of merriment . Then , like one deep bell</l>
     <l n="52">His voice rang out , in answer to their peal :—</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="53">“ Children of Cheape ,</l>
     <l n="54">Hold you all still !</l>

     <l n="56">Rung at your will ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="57">Loudly they cheered him . Courteously he bowed ,</l>
     <l n="58">Then firmly shut the window ; and , ere I filled</l>
     <l n="59">His cup with sack again , the crowd had gone .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="60">“ My clochard , sirs , is warm , ” quavered the Clerk .</l>
     <l n="61">“ I do confess I took some forty winks !</l>
     <l n="62">They are good lads , our prentices of Cheape ,</l>
     <l n="63">But hasty ! ”</l>
     <l n="64">“ Wine ! ” said Ben . He filled a cup</l>
     <l n="65">And thrust it into Gregory 's trembling hands .</l>
     <l n="66">“ Yours is a task , ” said Dekker , “ a great task !</l>
     <l n="67">You sit among the gods , a lord of time ,</l>
     <l n="68">Measuring out the pulse of London 's heart . ”</l>
     <l n="69">“ Yea , sir , above the hours and days and years ,</l>
     <l n="70">I sometimes think . ‘ Tis a great Bell — the Bow !</l>
     <l n="71">And hath been , since the days of Whittington . ”</l>
     <l n="72">“ The good old days , ” growled Ben . “ Both good and bad</l>
     <l n="73">Were measured by my Bell , ” the Clerk replied .</l>
     <l n="74">And , while he spoke , warmed by the wine , his voice</l>
     <l n="75">Mellowed and floated up and down the scale</l>
     <l n="76">As if the music of the London bells</l>
     <l n="77">Lingered upon his tongue . “ I know them all ,</l>
     <l n="78">And love them , all the voices of the bells .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="79">FLOS MERCATORUM ! That 's the Bell of Bow</l>
     <l n="80">Remembering Richard Whittington . You should hear</l>
     <l n="81">The bells of London when they tell his tale .</l>
     <l n="82">Once , after hearing them , I wrote it down .</l>
     <l n="83">I know the tale by heart now , every turn . ”</l>
     <l n="84">“ Then ring it out , ” said Heywood .</l>
     <l n="85">Gregory smiled</l>
     <l n="86">And cleared his throat .</l>
     <l n="87">“ You must imagine , sirs ,</l>
     <l n="88">The Clerk , sitting on high , among the clouds ,</l>
     <l n="89">With London spread beneath him like a map .</l>
     <l n="90">Under his tower , a flock of prentices</l>

     <l n="95">Then Gregory Clopton , mellowing all</l>
     <l n="96">The chiming vowels , and dwelling on every tone</l>
     <l n="97">In rhythm or rhyme that helped to swell the peal</l>
     <l n="98">Or keep the ringing measure , beat for beat ,</l>
     <l n="99">Chanted this legend of the London bells :—</l>

     <l n="389">Square , with a galleried courtyard , such as now</l>
     <l n="390">The players use . Its rooms were rich and dim</l>
     <l n="391">With deep-set coloured panes and massy beams .</l>
     <l n="392">Its ancient eaves jutted o'er Red Rose Lane</l>
     <l n="393">Darkly , like eyebrows of a mage asleep .</l>
     <l n="394">Its oaken stair coiled upward through a dusk</l>
     <l n="395">Heavy with fume of scented woods that burned</l>
     <l n="396">To keep the Plague away ,— a gloom to embalm</l>
     <l n="397">A Pharaoh , but to dull the cheek and eye</l>
     <l n="398">Of country lads like Whittington .</l>
     <l n="399">He pined</l>
     <l n="400">For wind and sunlight . Yet he plied his task</l>
     <l n="401">Patient as in old tales of Elfin-land ,</l>
     <l n="402">The young knight would unhelm his golden locks</l>
     <l n="403">And play the scullion , so that he might watch</l>
     <l n="404">His lady 's eyes unknown , and oftener hear</l>
     <l n="405">Her brook-like laughter rippling overhead ;</l>
     <l n="406">Her green gown , like the breath of Eden boughs ,</l>
     <l n="407">Rustling nigh him . And all day long he found</l>
     <l n="408">Sunshine enough in this . But when at night</l>
     <l n="409">He crept into the low dark vaulted den ,</l>
     <l n="410">The cobwebbed cellar , where the cook had strewn</l>
     <l n="411">The scullion 's bed of straw ( and none too thick</l>
     <l n="412">Lest he should sleep too long ) , he choked for breath ;</l>
     <l n="413">And , like an old man hoarding up his life ,</l>
     <l n="414">Fostered his glimmering rushlight as he sate</l>
     <l n="415">Bolt upright , while a horrible scurry heaved</l>
     <l n="416">His rustling bed , and bright black-beaded eyes</l>
     <l n="417">Peered at him from the crannies of the wall .</l>
     <l n="418">Then darkness whelmed him , and perchance he slept ,—</l>
     <l n="419">Only to fight with nightmares and to fly</l>
     <l n="420">Down endless tunnels in a ghastly dream ,</l>
     <l n="421">Hunted by horrible human souls that took</l>
     <l n="422">The shape of monstrous rats , great chattering snouts ,</l>
     <l n="423">Vile shapes of shadowy cunning and grey greed ,</l>
     <l n="424">That gnaw through beams , and undermine tall towns ,</l>
     <l n="425">And carry the seeds of plague and ruin and death</l>
     <l n="426">Under the careless homes of sleeping men .</l>
     <l n="427">Thus , in the darkness , did he wage a war</l>
     <l n="428">With all the powers of darkness . ‘ If the light</l>
     <l n="429">Do break upon me , by the grace of God , ’</l>
     <l n="430">So did he vow , ‘ O , then will I remember ,</l>
     <l n="431">Then , then , will I remember , ay , and help</l>
     <l n="432">To build that lovelier City which is paved</l>
     <l n="433">For rich and poor alike , with purest gold . ’</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="61">
     <l n="434">Ah , sirs , he kept his vow . Ye will not smile</l>
     <l n="435">If , at the first , the best that he could do</l>
     <l n="436">Was with his first poor penny-piece to buy</l>
     <l n="437">A cat , and bring her home , under his coat</l>
     <l n="438">By stealth ( or else that termagant , the cook ,</l>
     <l n="439">Had drowned it in the water-butt , nor deemed</l>
     <l n="440">The water worse to drink ) . So did he quell</l>
     <l n="441">First his own plague , but bettered others , too .</l>
     <l n="442">Now , in those days , Marchaunt Adventurers</l>
     <l n="443">Shared with their prentices the happy chance</l>
     <l n="444">Of each new venture . Each might have his stake ,</l>
     <l n="445">Little or great , upon the glowing tides</l>
     <l n="446">Of high romance that washed the wharfs of Thames ;</l>
     <l n="447">And every lad in London had his groat</l>
     <l n="448">Or splendid shilling on some fair ship at sea .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="62">
     <l n="449">So , on an April eve , Fitzwarren called</l>
     <l n="450">His prentices together ; for , ere long ,</l>
     <l n="451">The Unicorn , his tall new ship , must sail</l>
     <l n="452">Beyond the world to gather gorgeous webs</l>
     <l n="453">From Eastern looms , great miracles of silk</l>
     <l n="454">Dipt in the dawn by wizard hands of Ind ;</l>
     <l n="455">Or , if they chanced upon that fabled coast</l>
     <l n="456">Where Sydon , river of jewels , like a snake</l>
     <l n="457">Slides down the gorge its coils of crimson fire ,</l>
     <l n="458">Perchance a richer cargo ,— rubies , pearls ,</l>
     <l n="459">Or gold bars from the Gates of Paradise .</l>
     <l n="460">And many a moon , at least , a faërie foam</l>
     <l n="461">Would lap Blackfriars wharf , where London lads</l>
     <l n="462">Gazed in the sunset down that misty reach</l>
     <l n="463">For old black battered hulks and tattered sails</l>
     <l n="464">Bringing their dreams home from the uncharted sea .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="63">
     <l n="465">And one flung down a groat — he had no more .</l>
     <l n="466">One staked a shilling , one a good French crown ;</l>
     <l n="467">And one an angel , O , light-winged enough</l>
     <l n="468">To reach Cathay ; and not a lad but bought</l>
     <l n="469">His pennyworth of wonder ,</l>
     <l n="470">So they thought ,</l>
     <l n="471">Till all at once Fitzwarren 's daughter cried</l>
     <l n="472">‘ Father , you have forgot poor Whittington ! ’</l>
     <l n="473">“ Snails , ’ laughed the rosy marchaunt , ‘ but that 's true !</l>
     <l n="474">Fetch Whittington ! The lad must stake his groat !</l>
     <l n="475">‘ Twill bring us luck ! ’</l>
     <l n="476">‘ Whittington ! Whittington ! ’</l>
     <l n="477">Down the dark stair , like a gold-headed bird ,</l>
     <l n="478">Fluttered sweet Alice . ‘ Whittington ! Richard ! Quick !</l>
     <l n="479">Quick with your groat now for the Unicorn ! ’</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="64">
     <l n="480">‘ A groat ! ’ cried Whittington , standing there aghast ,</l>
     <l n="481">With brown bare arms , still coloured by the sun ,</l>
     <l n="482">Among his pots and pans . ‘ Where should I find</l>
     <l n="483">A groat ? I staked my last groat in a cat ! ’</l>
     <l n="484">— ‘ What ! Have you nothing ? Nothing but a cat ?</l>
     <l n="485">Then stake the cat , ’ she said ; and the quick fire</l>
     <l n="486">That in a woman 's mind out-runs the thought</l>
     <l n="487">Of man , lit her grey eyes .</l>
     <l n="488">Whittington laughed</l>
     <l n="489">And opened the cellar-door . Out sailed his wealth ,</l>
     <l n="490">Waving its tail , purring , and rubbing its head</l>
     <l n="491">Now on his boots , now on the dainty shoe</l>
     <l n="492">Of Alice , who straightway , deaf to his laughing prayers ,</l>
     <l n="493">Caught up the cat , whispered it , hugged it close ,</l>
     <l n="494">Against its grey fur leaned her glowing cheek ,</l>
     <l n="495">And carried it off in triumph .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="65">
     <l n="496">Red Rose Lane</l>
     <l n="497">Echoed with laughter as , with amber eyes</l>
     <l n="498">Blinking , the grey cat in a seaman 's arms</l>
     <l n="499">Went to the wharf . ‘ Ay , but we need a cat , ’</l>
     <l n="500">The captain said . So , when the painted ship</l>
     <l n="501">Sailed through a golden sunrise down the Thames ,</l>
     <l n="502">A grey tail waved upon the misty poop ,</l>
     <l n="503">And Whittington had his venture on the seas .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="66">
     <l n="504">It was a nine days ’ jest , and soon forgot .</l>
     <l n="505">But , all that year ,— ah , sirs , ye know the world ,</l>
     <l n="506">For all the foolish boasting of the proud ,</l>
     <l n="507">Looks not beneath the coat of Taunton serge</l>
     <l n="508">For Gules and Azure . A prince that comes in rags</l>
     <l n="509">To clean your shoes and , out of his own pride ,</l>
     <l n="510">Waits for the world to paint his shield again</l>
     <l n="511">Must wait for ever and a day .</l>
     <l n="512">The world</l>
     <l n="513">Is a great hypocrite , hypocrite most of all</l>
     <l n="514">When thus it boasts its purple pride of race ,</l>
     <l n="515">Then with eyes blind to all but pride of place</l>
     <l n="516">Tramples the scullion 's heraldry underfoot ,</l>
     <l n="517">Nay , never sees it , never dreams of it ,</l>
     <l n="518">Content to know that , here and now , his coat</l>
     <l n="519">Is greasy ....</l>
     <l n="520">So did Whittington find at last</l>
     <l n="521">Such nearness was most distant ; that to see her ,</l>
     <l n="522">Talk with her , serve her thus , was but to lose</l>
     <l n="523">True sight , true hearing . He must save his life</l>
     <l n="524">By losing it ; forsake , to win , his love ;</l>
     <l n="525">Go out into the world to bring her home .</l>
     <l n="526">It was but labour lost to clean the shoes ,</l>
     <l n="527">And turn the jack , and scour the dripping-pan .</l>
     <l n="528">For every scolding blown about her ears</l>
     <l n="529">The cook 's great ladle fell upon the head</l>
     <l n="530">Of Whittington ; who , beneath her rule , became</l>
     <l n="531">The scullery 's general scapegoat . It was he</l>
     <l n="532">That burned the pie-crust , drank the hippocras ,</l>
     <l n="533">Dinted the silver beaker ....</l>
     <l n="534">Many a month</l>
     <l n="535">He chafed , till his resolve took sudden shape</l>
     <l n="536">And , out of the dark house at the peep of day ,</l>
     <l n="537">Shouldering bundle and stick again , he stole</l>
     <l n="538">To seek his freedom , and to shake the dust</l>
     <l n="539">Of London from his shoes ....</l>
     <l n="540">You know the stone</l>
     <l n="541">On Highgate , where he sate awhile to rest ,</l>
     <l n="542">With aching heart , and thought ‘ I shall not see</l>
     <l n="543">Her face again . ’ There , as the coloured dawn</l>
     <l n="544">Over the sleeping City slowly bloomed ,</l>
     <l n="545">A small black battered ship with tattered sails</l>
     <l n="546">Blurring the burnished glamour of the Thames</l>
     <l n="547">Crept , side-long to a wharf .</l>
     <l n="548">Then , all at once ,</l>
     <l n="549">The London bells rang out a welcome home ;</l>
     <l n="550">And , over them all , tossing the tenor on high ,</l>
     <l n="551">The Bell of Bow , a sun among the stars ,</l>
     <l n="552">Flooded the morning air with this refrain :—</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="67">
     <l n="553">‘ Turn again , Whittington ! Turn again , Whittington !</l>
     <l n="554">Flos Mercatorum , thy ship hath come home !</l>
     <l n="555">Trailing from her cross-trees the crimson of the sunrise ,</l>
     <l n="556">Dragging all the glory of the sunset thro ’ the foam .</l>
     <l n="557">Turn again , Whittington ,</l>
     <l n="558">Turn again , Whittington ,</l>
     <l n="559">Lord Mayor of London !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="68">
     <l n="560">Turn again , Whittington ! When thy hope was darkest ,</l>
     <l n="561">Far beyond the sky-line a ship sailed for thee .</l>
     <l n="562">Flos Mercatorum , O , when thy faith was blindest ,</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="69">
     <l n="564">So he heard and heeded us , and turned again to London ,</l>
     <l n="565">Stick and bundle on his back , he turned to Red Rose Lane ,</l>
     <l n="566">Hardly hearing as he went the chatter of the prentices ,—</l>
     <l n="567">What d'ye lack , and what d'ye lack , and what d'ye lack again ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="70">
     <l n="568">Back into the scullery , before the cook had missed him ,</l>
     <l n="569">Early in the morning his labours he began :</l>
     <l n="570">Once again to clean the shoes and clatter with the water-pail ,</l>
     <l n="571">Once again to scrub the jack and scour the dripping-pan .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="71">
     <l n="572">All the bells of London were pealing as he laboured .</l>
     <l n="573">Wildly beat his heart , and his blood began to race .</l>
     <l n="574">Then — there came a light step and , suddenly , beside him</l>
     <l n="575">Stood his lady Alice , with a light upon her face .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="72">
     <l n="576">‘ Quick , ’ she said , ‘ O , quick , ’ she said , ‘ they want you ,</l>

     <l n="579">All that she had hidden long , and all she still would hide from him .</l>
     <l n="580">So — he turned and followed her , his green-gowned maid .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="73">
     <l n="581">There , in a broad dark oaken-panelled room</l>

     <l n="583">Of silver , sirs , and massy halpace built</l>
     <l n="584">Half over Red Rose Lane , Fitzwarren sat ;</l>

     <l n="586">That suddenly comes true and fills the world</l>
     <l n="587">With April colours , two bronzed seamen stood ,</l>
     <l n="588">Tattered and scarred , and stained with sun and brine .</l>
     <l n="589">‘ Flos Mercatorum , ’ Hugh Fitzwarren cried ,</l>

     <l n="592">Thy cat hath caught the biggest mouse of all ! ’</l>
     <l n="593">And , on to the table , tilting a heavy sack ,</l>
     <l n="594">One of the seamen poured a glittering stream</l>
     <l n="595">Of rubies , emeralds , opals , amethysts ,</l>
     <l n="596">That turned the room to an Aladdin 's cave ,</l>
     <l n="597">Or magic goblet brimmed with dusky wine</l>

     <l n="620">‘ Ay , the ship was mine ; but in that ship</l>
     <l n="621">Your stake was richer than we knew . ‘ Tis yours . ’</l>

     <l n="1">Ben was our only guest that day . His tribe</l>

     <l n="4">Above their doors like some great-fruited vine ,</l>

     <l n="52">The window darkened , and I saw a face</l>

     <l n="54">And led him gently to a room within ,</l>
     <l n="55">Out of the way of guests .</l>
     <l n="56">“ Your pride , ” he said ,</l>

     <l n="61">Far out at sea , the weather and world-worn man ,</l>
     <l n="62">That once was Raleigh , lifted up his head .</l>
     <l n="63">Old age and weakness , weariness and fear</l>
     <l n="64">Fell from him like a cloak . He stood erect .</l>
     <l n="65">His eager eyes , full of great sea-washed dawns ,</l>
     <l n="66">Burned for a moment with immortal youth ,</l>
     <l n="67">While tears blurred mine to see him .</l>
     <l n="68">“ You do think</l>
     <l n="69">That England will remember ? You do think it ? ”</l>
     <l n="70">He asked with a great light upon his face .</l>
     <l n="71">Ben bowed his head in silence .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="72">“ I have wronged</l>
     <l n="73">My cause by this , ” said Raleigh . “ Well they know it</l>
     <l n="74">Who left this way for me . I have flung myself</l>
     <l n="75">Like a blind moth into this deadly light</l>
     <l n="76">Of freedom . Now , at the eleventh hour ,</l>
     <l n="77">Is it too late ? I might return and — ”</l>
     <l n="78">“ No !</l>
     <l n="79">Not now ! ” Ben interrupted . “ I 'd have said</l>
     <l n="80">Laugh at the headsman sixteen years ago ,</l>
     <l n="81">When England was awake . She will awake</l>
     <l n="82">Again . But now , while our most gracious king ,</l>
     <l n="83">Who hates tobacco , dedicates his prayers</l>
     <l n="84">To Buckingham —</l>
     <l n="85">This is no land for men that , under God ,</l>
     <l n="86">Shattered the Fleet Invincible . ”</l>
     <l n="87">A knock</l>
     <l n="88">Startled us , at the outer door . “ My friend</l>
     <l n="89">Stukeley , ” said Raleigh , “ if I know his hand .</l>
     <l n="90">He has a ketch will carry me to France ,</l>
     <l n="91">Waiting at Tilbury . ”</l>
     <l n="92">I let him in ,—</l>
     <l n="93">A lean and stealthy fellow , Sir Lewis Stukeley ,—</l>
     <l n="94">liked him little . He thought much of his health ,</l>
     <l n="95">More of his money bags , and most of all</l>
     <l n="96">On how to run with all men all at once</l>
     <l n="97">For his own profit . At the Mermaid Inn</l>
     <l n="98">Men disagreed in friendship and in truth ;</l>
     <l n="99">But he agreed with all men , and his life</l>
     <l n="100">Was one soft quag of falsehood . Fugitives</l>
     <l n="101">Must use false keys , I thought ; and there was hope</l>
     <l n="102">For Raleigh if such a man would walk one mile</l>
     <l n="103">To serve him now . Yet my throat moved to see him</l>
     <l n="104">Usurping , with one hand on Raleigh 's arm ,</l>
     <l n="105">A kind of ownership . “ Lend me ten pounds , ”</l>
     <l n="106">Were the first words he breathed in the old man 's ear ,</l>
     <l n="107">And Raleigh slipped his purse into his hand .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="108">Just over Bread Street hung the bruised white moon</l>
     <l n="109">When they crept out . Sir Lewis Stukeley 's watch-dog ,</l>
     <l n="110">A derelict bo'sun , with a mulberry face ,</l>
     <l n="111">Met them outside . “ The coast quite clear , eh , Hart ? ”</l>
     <l n="112">Said Stukeley . “ Ah , that 's good . Lead on , then , quick . ”</l>
     <l n="113">And there , framed in the cruddle of moonlit clouds</l>
     <l n="114">That ended the steep street , dark on its light ,</l>
     <l n="115">And standing on those glistening cobblestones</l>
     <l n="116">Just where they turned to silver , Raleigh looked back</l>
     <l n="117">Before he turned the corner . He stood there .</l>
     <l n="118">A figure like foot-feathered Mercury ,</l>
     <l n="119">Tall , straight and splendid , waving his plumed hat</l>
     <l n="120">To Ben , and taking his last look , I felt ,</l>
     <l n="121">Upon our Mermaid Tavern . As he paused ,</l>
     <l n="122">His long fantastic shadow swayed and swept</l>
     <l n="123">Against our feet . Then , like a shadow , he passed .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="124">“ It is not right , ” said Ben , “ it is not right .</l>
     <l n="125">Why did they give the old man so much grace ?</l>
     <l n="126">Witness and evidence are what they lack .</l>
     <l n="127">Would you trust Stukeley — not to draw him out ?</l>
     <l n="128">Raleigh was always rash . A phrase or two</l>
     <l n="129">Will turn their murderous axe into a sword</l>
     <l n="130">Of righteousness —</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="131">Why , come to think of it ,</l>
     <l n="132">Blackfriar 's Wharf , last night , I landed there ,</l>
     <l n="133">And — no , by God !— Raleigh is not himself ,</l>
     <l n="134">The tide will never serve beyond Gravesend .</l>
     <l n="135">It is a trap ! Come on ! We 'll follow them !</l>
     <l n="136">Quick ! To the river side ! ” —</l>
     <l n="137">We reached the wharf</l>
     <l n="138">Only to see their wherry , a small black cloud</l>
     <l n="139">Dwindling far down that running silver road .</l>
     <l n="140">Ben touched my arm .</l>
     <l n="141">“ Look there , ” he said , pointing up-stream .</l>
     <l n="142">The moon</l>
     <l n="143">Glanced on a cluster of pikes , like silver thorns ,</l>
     <l n="144">Three hundred yards away , a little troop</l>
     <l n="145">Of weaponed men , embarking hurriedly .</l>
     <l n="146">Their great black wherry clumsily swung about ,</l>
     <l n="147">Then , with twelve oars for legs , came striding down ,</l>
     <l n="148">An armoured beetle on the glittering trail</l>
     <l n="149">Of some small victim .</l>
     <l n="150">Just below our wharf</l>
     <l n="151">A little dinghy waddled .</l>
     <l n="152">Ben cut the painter , and without one word</l>
     <l n="153">Drew her up crackling thro ’ the lapping water ,</l>
     <l n="154">Motioned me to the tiller , thrust her off ,</l>
     <l n="155">And , pulling with one oar , backing with the other ,</l>
     <l n="156">Swirled her round and down , hard on the track</l>
     <l n="157">Of Raleigh . Ben was an old man now but tough ,</l>
     <l n="158">O tough as a buccaneer . We distanced them .</l>
     <l n="159">His oar blades drove the silver boiling back .</l>
     <l n="160">By Broken Wharf the beetle was a speck .</l>
     <l n="161">It dwindled by Queen Hythe and the Three Cranes .</l>
     <l n="162">By Bellyn 's Gate we had left it , out of sight .</l>
     <l n="163">By Custom House and Galley Keye we shot</l>
     <l n="164">Thro ’ silver all the way , without one glimpse</l>
     <l n="165">Of Raleigh . Then a dreadful shadow fell</l>
     <l n="166">And over us the Tower of London rose</l>
     <l n="167">Like ebony ; and , on the glittering reach</l>
     <l n="168">Beyond it , I could see the small black cloud</l>
     <l n="169">That carried the great old seaman slowly down</l>
     <l n="170">Between the dark shores whence in happier years</l>
     <l n="171">The throng had cheered his golden galleons out ,</l>
     <l n="172">And watched his proud sails filling for Cathay .</l>
     <l n="173">There , as through lead , we dragged by Traitor 's Gate ,</l>
     <l n="174">There , in the darkness , under the Bloody Tower ,</l>
     <l n="175">There , on the very verge of victory ,</l>
     <l n="176">Ben gasped and dropped his oars .</l>
     <l n="177">“ Take one and row , ” he said , “ my arms are numbed .</l>
     <l n="178">We 'll overtake him yet ! ” I clambered past him ,</l>
     <l n="179">And took the bow oar .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="180">Once , as the pace flagged ,</l>
     <l n="181">Over his shoulder he turned his great scarred face</l>
     <l n="182">And snarled , with a trickle of blood on his coarse lips ,</l>
     <l n="183">“ Hard ! ” —</l>
     <l n="184">And blood and fire ran through my veins again ,</l>
     <l n="185">For half a minute more .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="186">Yet we fell back .</l>
     <l n="187">Our course was crooked now . And suddenly</l>
     <l n="188">A grim black speck began to grow behind us ,</l>
     <l n="189">Grow like the threat of death upon old age .</l>
     <l n="190">Then , thickening , blackening , sharpening , foaming , swept</l>
     <l n="191">Up the bright line of bubbles in our wake ,</l>
     <l n="192">That armoured wherry , with its long twelve oars</l>
     <l n="193">All well together now .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="194">“ Too late , ” gasped Ben ,</l>
     <l n="195">His ash-grey face uplifted to the moon ,</l>
     <l n="196">One quivering hand upon the thwart behind him ,</l>
     <l n="197">A moment . Then he bowed over his knees</l>
     <l n="198">Coughing . “ But we 'll delay them . We 'll be drunk ,</l>
     <l n="199">And hold the catch-polls up ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="200">We drifted down</l>
     <l n="201">Before them , broadside on . They sheered aside .</l>
     <l n="202">Then , feigning a clumsy stroke , Ben drove our craft</l>
     <l n="203">As they drew level , right in among their blades .</l>
     <l n="204">There was a shout , an oath . They thrust us off ;</l>
     <l n="205">And then we swung our nose against their bows</l>
     <l n="206">And pulled them round with every well-meant stroke .</l>
     <l n="207">A full half minute , ere they won quite free ,</l>
     <l n="208">Cursing us for a pair of drunken fools .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="209">We drifted down behind them .</l>

     <l n="211">Said Ben , “ the headsman waits behind all this</l>

     <l n="213">Of England , teach the people to applaud</l>
     <l n="214">The red fifth act . ”</l>
     <l n="215">Without another word we drifted down</l>
     <l n="216">For centuries it seemed , until we came</l>
     <l n="217">To Greenwich .</l>
     <l n="218">Then up the long white burnished reach there crept</l>
     <l n="219">Like little sooty clouds the two black boats</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="224">Long after this ,</l>
     <l n="225">We heard how Raleigh , simply as a child ,</l>
     <l n="226">Seeing the tide would never serve him now ,</l>
     <l n="227">And they must turn , had taken from his neck</l>
     <l n="228">Some trinkets that he wore . “ Keep them , ” he said</l>
     <l n="229">To Stukeley , “ in remembrance of this night . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="230">He had no doubts of Stukeley when he saw</l>
     <l n="231">The wherry close beside them . He but wrapped</l>
     <l n="232">His cloak a little closer round his face .</l>
     <l n="233">Our boat rocked in their wash when Stukeley dropped</l>
     <l n="234">The mask . We saw him give the sign , and heard</l>
     <l n="235">His high-pitched quavering voice — “ IN THE KING 'S NAME ! ”</l>
     <l n="236">Raleigh rose to his feet . “ I am under arrest ? ”</l>
     <l n="237">He said , like a dazed man .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="238">And Stukeley laughed .</l>
     <l n="239">Then , as he bore himself to the grim end ,</l>
     <l n="240">All doubt being over , the old sea-king stood</l>
     <l n="241">Among those glittering points , a king indeed .</l>
     <l n="242">The black boats rocked . We heard his level voice ,</l>
     <l n="243">“ Sir Lewis , these actions never will turn out</l>
     <l n="244">To your good credit . ” Across the moonlit Thames</l>
     <l n="245">It rang contemptuously , cold as cold steel ,</l>
     <l n="246">And passionless as the judgment that ends all .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="247">Some three months later , Raleigh 's widow came</l>
     <l n="248">To lodge a se'nnight at the Mermaid Inn .</l>
     <l n="249">His house in Bread Street was no more her own ,</l>
     <l n="250">But in the hands of Stukeley , who had reaped</l>
     <l n="251">A pretty harvest ...</l>
     <l n="252">She kept close to her room , and that same night ,</l>
     <l n="253">Being ill and with some fever , sent her maid</l>
     <l n="254">To fetch the apothecary from Friday Street ,</l>
     <l n="255">Old “ Galen ” as the Mermaid christened him .</l>
     <l n="256">At that same moment , as the maid went out ,</l>
     <l n="257">Stukeley came in . He met her at the door ;</l>
     <l n="258">And , chucking her under the chin , gave her a letter .</l>
     <l n="259">“ Take this up to your mistress . It concerns</l>
     <l n="260">Her property , ” he said . “ Say that I wait ,</l>
     <l n="261">And would be glad to speak with her . ”</l>
     <l n="262">The wench</l>
     <l n="263">Looked pertly in his face , and tripped upstairs .</l>
     <l n="264">I scarce could trust my hands .</l>
     <l n="265">“ Sir Lewis , ” I said ,</l>
     <l n="266">“ This is no time to trouble her . She is ill . ”</l>
     <l n="267">“ Let her decide , ” he answered , with a sneer .</l>
     <l n="268">Before I found another word to say</l>
     <l n="269">The maid tripped down again . I scarce believed</l>
     <l n="270">My senses , when she beckoned him up the stair .</l>
     <l n="271">Shaking from head to foot , I blocked the way .</l>
     <l n="272">“ Property ! ” Could the crux of mine and thine</l>
     <l n="273">Bring widow and murderer into one small room ?</l>
     <l n="274">“ Sir Lewis , ” I said , “ she is ill . It is not right !</l>
     <l n="275">She never would consent . ”</l>
     <l n="276">He sneered again ,</l>
     <l n="277">“ You are her doctor ? Out of the way , old fool !</l>
     <l n="278">She has decided ! ”</l>
     <l n="279">“ Go , ” I said to the maid ,</l>
     <l n="280">“ Fetch the apothecary . Let it rest</l>
     <l n="281">With him ! ”</l>
     <l n="282">She tossed her head . Her quick eyes glanced ,</l>
     <l n="283">Showing the white , like the eyes of a vicious mare .</l>
     <l n="284">She laughed at Stukeley , loitered , then obeyed .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="19">
     <l n="285">And so we waited , till the wench returned ,</l>
     <l n="286">With Galen at her heels . His wholesome face ,</l>
     <l n="287">Russet and wrinkled like an apple , peered</l>
     <l n="288">Shrewdly at Stukeley , twinkled once at me ,</l>
     <l n="289">And passed in silence , leaving a whiff of herbs</l>
     <l n="290">Behind him on the stair .</l>
     <l n="291">Five minutes later ,</l>
     <l n="292">To my amazement , that same wholesome face</l>
     <l n="293">Leaned from the lighted door above , and called</l>
     <l n="294">“ Sir Lewis Stukeley ! ”</l>
     <l n="295">Sir Judas hastened up .</l>
     <l n="296">The apothecary followed him within .</l>
     <l n="297">The door shut . I was left there in the dark</l>
     <l n="298">Bewildered ; for my heart was hot with thoughts</l>
     <l n="299">Of those last months . Our Summer 's Nightingale ,</l>
     <l n="300">Our Ocean-Shepherd from the Main-deep Sea ,</l>
     <l n="301">The Founder of our Mermaid Fellowship ,</l>
     <l n="302">Was this his guerdon — at the Mermaid Inn ?</l>
     <l n="303">Was this that maid-of-honour whose romance</l>
     <l n="304">With Raleigh , once , had been a kingdom 's talk ?</l>
     <l n="305">Could Bess Throckmorton slight his memory thus ?</l>
     <l n="306">“ It is not right , ” I said , “ it is not right .</l>
     <l n="307">She wrongs him deeply . ”</l>
     <l n="308">I leaned against the porch</l>
     <l n="309">Staring into the night . A ghostly ray</l>
     <l n="310">Above me , from her window , bridged the street ,</l>
     <l n="311">And rested on the goldsmith 's painted sign</l>
     <l n="312">Opposite .</l>
     <l n="313">I could hear the muffled voice</l>
     <l n="314">Of Stukeley overhead , persuasive , bland ;</l>
     <l n="315">And then , her own , cooing , soft as a dove</l>
     <l n="316">Calling her mate from Eden cedar-boughs ,</l>
     <l n="317">Flowed on and on ; and then — all my flesh crept</l>
     <l n="318">At something worse than either , a long space</l>
     <l n="319">Of silence that stretched threatening and cold ,</l>
     <l n="320">Cold as a dagger-point pricking the skin</l>
     <l n="321">Over my heart .</l>
     <l n="322">Then came a stifled cry ,</l>
     <l n="323">A crashing door , a footstep on the stair</l>
     <l n="324">Blundering like a drunkard 's , heavily down ;</l>
     <l n="325">And with his gasping face one tragic mask</l>
     <l n="326">Of horror ,— may God help me to forget</l>
     <l n="327">Some day the frozen awful eyes of one</l>
     <l n="328">Who , fearing neither hell nor heaven , has met</l>
     <l n="329">That ultimate weapon of the gods , the face</l>
     <l n="330">And serpent-tresses that turn flesh to stone —</l>
     <l n="331">Stukeley stumbled , groping his way out ,</l>
     <l n="332">Blindly , past me , into the sheltering night .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>It was the last night of another year Before I understood what punishment Had overtaken Stukeley . Ben , and Brome — Ben 's ancient servant , but turned poet now — Sat by the fire with the old apothecary To see the New Year in . The starry night Had drawn me to the door . Could it be true That our poor earth no longer was the hub Of those white wheeling orbs ? I scarce believed The strange new dreams ; but I had seen the veils Rent from vast oceans and huge continents , Till what was once our comfortable fire , Our cosy tavern , and our earthly home With heaven beyond the next turn in the road , All the resplendent fabric of our world Shrank to a glow-worm , lighting up one leaf In one small forest , in one little land , Among those wild infinitudes of God . A tattered wastrel wandered down the street , Clad in a seaman 's jersey , staring hard At every sign . Beneath our own , the light Fell on his red carbuncled face . I knew him — The bo'sun , Hart . He pointed to our sign And leered at me . “ That 's her , ” he said , “ no doubt , The sea-witch with the shiny mackerel tail Swishing in wine . That 's what Sir Lewis meant . He called it blood . Blood is his craze , you see . This is the Mermaid Tavern , sir , no doubt ? ” I nodded . “ Ah , I thought as much , ” he said . “ Well — happen this is worth a cup of ale . ” He thrust his hand under his jersey and lugged A greasy letter out . It was inscribed THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">I led him in . “ I knew it , sir , ” he said ,</l>
     <l n="2">While Galen broke the seal . “ Soon as I saw</l>
     <l n="3">That sweet young naked wench curling her tail</l>
