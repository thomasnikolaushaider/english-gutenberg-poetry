   <div type="introduction">
    <head>Introduction</head>
    <p n="1">In writing an Introduction such as this it is good to be brief . The poems printed in this book need no preliminary commendations from me or anyone else . The author has left us his own fragmentary but impressive Foreword ; this , and his Poems , can speak for him , backed by the authority of his experience as an infantry soldier , and sustained by nobility and originality of style . All that was strongest in Wilfred Owen survives in his poems ; any superficial impressions of his personality , any records of his conversation , behaviour , or appearance , would be irrelevant and unseemly . The curiosity which demands such morsels would be incapable of appreciating the richness of his work .</p>
    <p n="2">The discussion of his experiments in assonance and dissonance ( of which ‘ Strange Meeting ’ is the finest example ) may be left to the professional critics of verse , the majority of whom will be more preoccupied with such technical details than with the profound humanity of the self - revelation manifested in such magnificent lines as those at the end of his ‘ Apologia pro Poemate Meo ’ , and in that other poem which he named ‘ Greater Love ’ .</p>
    <p n="3">The importance of his contribution to the literature of the War cannot be decided by those who , like myself , both admired him as a poet and valued him as a friend . His conclusions about War are so entirely in accordance with my own that I cannot attempt to judge his work with any critical detachment . I can only affirm that he was a man of absolute integrity of mind . He never wrote his poems ( as so many war-poets did ) to make the effect of a personal gesture . He pitied others ; he did not pity himself . In the last year of his life he attained a clear vision of what he needed to say , and these poems survive him as his true and splendid testament .</p>
    <p n="4">Wilfred Owen was born at Oswestry on 18th March 1893 . He was educated at the Birkenhead Institute , and matriculated at London University in 1910 . In 1913 he obtained a private tutorship near Bordeaux , where he remained until 1915 . During this period he became acquainted with the eminent French poet , Laurent Tailhade , to whom he showed his early verses , and from whom he received considerable encouragement . In 1915 , in spite of delicate health , he joined the Artists ’ Rifles O. T. C ., was gazetted to the Manchester Regiment , and served with their 2nd Battalion in France from December 1916 to June 1917 , when he was invalided home . Fourteen months later he returned to the Western Front and served with the same Battalion , ultimately commanding a Company .</p>
    <p n="5">He was awarded the Military Cross for gallantry while taking part in some heavy fighting on 1st October . He was killed on 4th November 1918 , while endeavouring to get his men across the Sambre Canal .</p>
    <p n="6">A month before his death he wrote to his mother : “ My nerves are in perfect order . I came out again in order to help these boys ; directly , by leading them as well as an officer can ; indirectly , by watching their sufferings that I may speak of them as well as a pleader can . ” Let his own words be his epitaph :—</p>
    <p n="7">“ Courage was mine , and I had mystery ; Wisdom was mine , and I had mastery . ”</p>
    <p n="8">Siegfried Sassoon .</p>

    <head>Preface</head>
    <p n="9">This book is not about heroes . English Poetry is not yet fit to speak of them . Nor is it about deeds or lands , nor anything about glory , honour , dominion or power ,</p>
    <p n="10">except War . Above all , this book is not concerned with Poetry . The subject of it is War , and the pity of War . The Poetry is in the pity . Yet these elegies are not to this generation , This is in no sense consolatory .</p>
    <p n="11">They may be to the next . All the poet can do to-day is to warn . That is why the true Poets must be truthful . If I thought the letter of this book would last , I might have used proper names ; but if the spirit of it survives Prussia ,— my ambition and those names will be content ; for they will have achieved themselves fresher fields than Flanders .</p>

     <p>Strange Meeting</p>
     <lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">It seemed that out of the battle I escaped</l>
       <l n="2">Down some profound dull tunnel , long since scooped</l>
       <l n="3">Through granites which Titanic wars had groined .</l>
       <l n="4">Yet also there encumbered sleepers groaned ,</l>
       <l n="5">Too fast in thought or death to be bestirred .</l>
       <l n="6">Then , as I probed them , one sprang up , and stared</l>
       <l n="7">With piteous recognition in fixed eyes ,</l>
       <l n="8">Lifting distressful hands as if to bless .</l>
       <l n="9">And by his smile , I knew that sullen hall ;</l>
       <l n="10">With a thousand fears that vision 's face was grained ;</l>
       <l n="11">Yet no blood reached there from the upper ground ,</l>
       <l n="12">And no guns thumped , or down the flues made moan .</l>
       <l n="13">“ Strange , friend , ” I said , “ Here is no cause to mourn . ”</l>
       <l n="14">“ None , ” said the other , “ Save the undone years ,</l>
       <l n="15">The hopelessness . Whatever hope is yours ,</l>
       <l n="16">Was my life also ; I went hunting wild</l>
       <l n="17">After the wildest beauty in the world ,</l>
       <l n="18">Which lies not calm in eyes , or braided hair ,</l>
       <l n="19">But mocks the steady running of the hour ,</l>
       <l n="20">And if it grieves , grieves richlier than here .</l>
       <l n="21">For by my glee might many men have laughed ,</l>
       <l n="22">And of my weeping something has been left ,</l>
       <l n="23">Which must die now . I mean the truth untold ,</l>
       <l n="24">The pity of war , the pity war distilled .</l>
       <l n="25">Now men will go content with what we spoiled .</l>
       <l n="26">Or , discontent , boil bloody , and be spilled .</l>
       <l n="27">They will be swift with swiftness of the tigress ,</l>
       <l n="28">None will break ranks , though nations trek from progress .</l>
       <l n="29">Courage was mine , and I had mystery ;</l>
       <l n="30">Wisdom was mine , and I had mastery ;</l>
       <l n="31">To miss the march of this retreating world</l>
       <l n="32">Into vain citadels that are not walled .</l>
       <l n="33">Then , when much blood had clogged their chariot-wheels</l>
       <l n="34">I would go up and wash them from sweet wells ,</l>
       <l n="35">Even with truths that lie too deep for taint .</l>
       <l n="36">I would have poured my spirit without stint</l>
       <l n="37">But not through wounds ; not on the cess of war .</l>
       <l n="38">Foreheads of men have bled where no wounds were .</l>
       <l n="39">I am the enemy you killed , my friend .</l>
       <l n="40">I knew you in this dark ; for so you frowned</l>
       <l n="41">Yesterday through me as you jabbed and killed .</l>
       <l n="42">I parried ; but my hands were loath and cold .</l>
       <l n="43">Let us sleep now . . . ”</l>

       <l n="17">Where even the little brambles would not yield ,</l>

       <l n="3">And shivered in his ghastly suit of grey ,</l>
       <l n="4">Legless , sewn short at elbow . Through the park</l>
       <l n="5">Voices of boys rang saddening like a hymn ,</l>

       <l n="9">When glow-lamps budded in the light-blue trees</l>
       <l n="10">And girls glanced lovelier as the air grew dim ,</l>
       <l n="11">— In the old times , before he threw away his knees .</l>
       <l n="12">Now he will never feel again how slim</l>
       <l n="13">Girls ’ waists are , or how warm their subtle hands ,</l>
       <l n="14">All of them touch him like some queer disease .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="15">There was an artist silly for his face ,</l>
       <l n="16">For it was younger than his youth , last year .</l>
       <l n="17">Now he is old ; his back will never brace ;</l>
       <l n="18">He 's lost his colour very far from here ,</l>
       <l n="19">Poured it down shell-holes till the veins ran dry ,</l>
       <l n="20">And half his lifetime lapsed in the hot race ,</l>
       <l n="21">And leap of purple spurted from his thigh .</l>
       <l n="22">One time he liked a bloodsmear down his leg ,</l>
       <l n="23">After the matches carried shoulder-high .</l>
       <l n="24">It was after football , when he 'd drunk a peg ,</l>

       <l n="29">He asked to join . He did n't have to beg ;</l>

       <l n="31">Germans he scarcely thought of ; and no fears</l>
       <l n="32">Of Fear came yet . He thought of jewelled hilts</l>

       <l n="34">And care of arms ; and leave ; and pay arrears ;</l>
       <l n="35">Esprit de corps ; and hints for young recruits .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="37">Some cheered him home , but not as crowds cheer Goal .</l>
       <l n="38">Only a solemn man who brought him fruits</l>
       <l n="39">Thanked him ; and then inquired about his soul .</l>
       <l n="40">Now , he will spend a few sick years in Institutes ,</l>
       <l n="41">And do what things the rules consider wise ,</l>
       <l n="42">And take whatever pity they may dole .</l>
       <l n="43">To-night he noticed how the women 's eyes</l>
       <l n="44">Passed from him to the strong men that were whole .</l>
       <l n="45">How cold and late it is ! Why do n't they come</l>
       <l n="46">And put him into bed ? Why do n't they come ?</l>
