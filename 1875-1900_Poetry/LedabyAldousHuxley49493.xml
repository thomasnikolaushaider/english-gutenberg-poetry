Silent and asleep Lie those pools now : but where they dream most deep , Men sometimes see ripples of shining hair And the young grace of bodies pale and bare , Shimmering far down — the ghosts these mirrors hold Of all the beauty they beheld of old , White limbs and heavenly eyes and the hair ’ s river of gold , For once these banks were peopled : Spartan girls Loosed here their maiden girdles and their curls , And stooping o ’ er the level water stole His darling mirror from the sun through whole Rapturous hours of gazing . The first star Of all this milky constellation , far Lovelier than any nymph of wood or green , Was she whom Tyndarus had made his queen For her sheer beauty and subtly moving grace — Leda , the fairest of our mortal race . Hymen had lit his torches but one week About her bed ( and still o ’ er her young cheek Passed rosy shadows of those thoughts that sped Across her mind , still virgin , still unwed , For all her body was her own no more ) , When Leda with her maidens to the shore Of bright Eurotas came , to escape the heat Of summer noon in waters coolly sweet . By a brown pool which opened smooth and clear Below the wrinkled water of a weir They sat them down under an old fir-tree To rest : and to the laughing melody Of their sweet speech the river ’ s rippling bore A liquid burden , while the sun did pour Pure colour out of heaven upon the earth . The meadows seethed with the incessant mirth Of grasshoppers , seen only when they flew Their curves of scarlet or sudden dazzling blue . Within the fir-tree ’ s round of unpierced shade The maidens sat with laughter and talk , or played , Gravely intent , their game of knuckle-bones ; Or tossed from hand to hand the old dry cones Littered about the tree . And one did sing A ballad of some far-off Spartan king , Who took a wife , but left her , well-away ! Slain by his foes upon their wedding-day . “ That was a piteous story ,” Leda sighed , “ To be a widow ere she was a bride .” “ Better ,” said one , “ to live a virgin life Alone , and never know the name of wife And bear the ugly burden of a child And have great pain by it . Let me live wild , A bird untamed by man !” “ Nay ,” cried another , “ I would be wife , if I should not be mother . Cypris I honour ; let the vulgar pay Their gross vows to Lucina when they pray . Our finer spirits would be blunted quite By bestial teeming ; but Love ’ s rare delight Wings the rapt soul towards Olympus ’ height .” “ Delight ?” cried Leda . “ Love to me has brought Nothing but pain and a world of shameful thought . When they say love is sweet , the poets lie ; ’ Tis but a trick to catch poor maidens by . What are their boasted pleasures ? I am queen To the most royal king the world has seen ; Therefore I should , if any woman might , Know at its full that exquisite delight . Yet these few days since I was made a wife Have held more bitterness than all my life , While I was yet a child .” The great bright tears Slipped through her lashes . “ Oh , my childish years ! Years that were all my own , too sadly few , When I was happy — and yet never knew How happy till to-day !” Her maidens came About her as she wept , whispering her name , Leda , sweet Leda , with a hundred dear Caressing words to soothe her heavy cheer . At last she started up with a fierce pride Upon her face . “ I am a queen ,” she cried , “ But had forgotten it a while ; and you , Wenches of mine , you were forgetful too . Undress me . We would bathe ourself .” So proud A queen she stood , that all her maidens bowed In trembling fear and scarcely dared approach To do her bidding . But at last the brooch Pinned at her shoulder is undone , the wide Girdle of silk beneath her breasts untied ; The tunic falls about her feet , and she Steps from the crocus folds of drapery , Dazzlingly naked , into the warm sun . God-like she stood ; then broke into a run , Leaping and laughing in the light , as though Life through her veins coursed with so swift a flow Of generous blood and fire that to remain Too long in statued queenliness were pain To that quick soul , avid of speed and joy . She ran , easily bounding , like a boy , Narrow of haunch and slim and firm of breast . Lovelier she seemed in motion than at rest , If that might be , when she was never less , Moving or still , than perfect loveliness . At last , with cheeks afire and heaving flank , She checked her race , and on the river ’ s bank Stood looking down at her own echoed shape And at the fish that , aimlessly agape , Hung midway up their heaven of flawless glass , Like angels waiting for eternity to pass . Leda drew breath and plunged ; her gasping cry Splashed up ; the water circled brokenly Out from that pearly shudder of dipped limbs ; The glittering pool laughed up its flowery brims , And everything , save the poor fish , rejoiced : Their idiot contemplation of the Moist , The Cold , the Watery , was in a trice Ended when Leda broke their crystal paradise .</titlePart></docTitle>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="2">Jove in his high Olympian chamber lay</l>
     <l n="3">Hugely supine , striving to charm away</l>
     <l n="4">In sleep the long , intolerable noon .</l>
     <l n="5">But heedless Morpheus still withheld his boon ,</l>
     <l n="6">And Jove upon his silk-pavilioned bed</l>
     <l n="7">Tossed wrathful and awake . His fevered head</l>
     <l n="8">Swarmed with a thousand fancies , which forecast</l>
     <l n="9">Delights to be , or savoured pleasures past .</l>
     <l n="10">Closing his eyes , he saw his eagle swift ,</l>
     <l n="11">Headlong as his own thunder , stoop and lift</l>
     <l n="12">On pinions upward labouring the prize</l>
     <l n="13">Of beauty ravished for the envious skies .</l>
     <l n="14">He saw again that bright , adulterous pair ,</l>
     <l n="15">Trapped by the limping husband unaware ,</l>
     <l n="16">Fast in each other ’ s arms , and faster in the snare —</l>
     <l n="17">And laughed remembering . Sometimes his thought</l>
     <l n="18">Went wandering over the earth and sought</l>
     <l n="19">Familiar places — temples by the sea ,</l>
     <l n="20">Cities and islands ; here a sacred tree</l>
     <l n="21">And there a cavern of shy nymphs .</l>
     <l n="22">He rolled</l>
     <l n="23">About his bed , in many a rich fold</l>
     <l n="24">Crumpling his Babylonian coverlet ,</l>
     <l n="25">And yawned and stretched . The smell of his own sweat</l>
     <l n="26">Brought back to mind his Libyan desert-fane</l>
     <l n="27">Of mottled granite , with its endless train</l>
     <l n="28">Of pilgrim camels , reeking towards the sky</l>
     <l n="29">Ammonian incense to his hornèd deity ;</l>
     <l n="30">The while their masters worshipped , offering</l>
     <l n="31">Huge teeth of ivory , while some would bring</l>
     <l n="32">Their Ethiop wives — sleek wineskins of black silk ,</l>
     <l n="33">Jellied and huge from drinking asses ’ milk</l>
     <l n="34">Through years of tropical idleness , to pray</l>
     <l n="35">For offspring ( whom he ever sent away</l>
     <l n="36">With prayers unanswered , lest their ebon race</l>
     <l n="37">Might breed and blacken the earth ’ s comely face ) .</l>
     <l n="38">Noon pressed on him a hotter , heavier weight .</l>
     <l n="39">O Love in Idleness ! how celibate</l>
     <l n="40">He felt ! Libido like a nemesis</l>
     <l n="41">Scourged him with itching memories of bliss .</l>
     <l n="42">The satin of imagined skin was sleek</l>
     <l n="43">And supply warm against his lips and cheek ,</l>
     <l n="44">And deep within soft hair ’ s dishevelled dusk</l>
     <l n="45">His eyelids fluttered ; like a flowery musk</l>
     <l n="46">The scent of a young body seemed to float</l>
     <l n="47">Faintly about him , close and yet remote —</l>
     <l n="48">For perfume and the essence of music dwell</l>
     <l n="49">In other worlds among the asphodel</l>
     <l n="50">Of unembodied life . Then all had flown ;</l>
     <l n="51">His dream had melted . In his bed , alone ,</l>
     <l n="52">Jove sweating lay and moaned , and longed in vain</l>
     <l n="53">To still the pulses of his burning pain .</l>
     <l n="54">In sheer despair at last he leapt from bed ,</l>
     <l n="55">Opened the window and thrust forth his head</l>
     <l n="56">Into Olympian ether . One fierce frown</l>
     <l n="57">Rifted the clouds , and he was looking down</l>
     <l n="58">Into a gulf of azure calm ; the rack</l>
     <l n="59">Seethed round about , tempestuously black ;</l>
     <l n="60">But the god ’ s eye could hold its angry thunders back .</l>
     <l n="61">There lay the world , down through the chasméd blue ,</l>
     <l n="62">Stretched out from edge to edge unto his view ;</l>
     <l n="63">And in the midst , bright as a summer ’ s day</l>
     <l n="64">At breathless noon , the Mediterranean lay ;</l>
     <l n="65">And Ocean round the world ’ s dim fringes tossed</l>
     <l n="66">His glaucous waves in mist and distance lost ;</l>
     <l n="67">And Pontus and the livid Caspian Sea</l>
     <l n="68">Stirred in their nightmare sleep uneasily .</l>
     <l n="69">And ’ twixt the seas rolled the wide fertile land ,</l>
     <l n="70">Dappled with green and tracts of tawny sand ,</l>
     <l n="71">And rich , dark fallows and fields of flowers aglow</l>
     <l n="72">And the white , changeless silences of snow ;</l>
     <l n="73">While here and there towns , like a living eye</l>
     <l n="74">Unclosed on earth ’ s blind face , towards the sky</l>
     <l n="75">Glanced their bright conscious beauty . Yet the sight</l>
     <l n="76">Of his fair earth gave him but small delight</l>
     <l n="77">Now in his restlessness : its beauty could</l>
     <l n="78">Do nought to quench the fever in his blood .</l>
     <l n="79">Desire lends sharpness to his searching eyes ;</l>
     <l n="80">Over the world his focused passion flies</l>
     <l n="81">Quicker than chasing sunlight on a day</l>
     <l n="82">Of storm and golden April . Far away</l>
     <l n="83">He sees the tranquil rivers of the East ,</l>
     <l n="84">Mirrors of many a strange barbaric feast ,</l>
     <l n="85">Where un-Hellenic dancing-girls contort</l>
     <l n="86">Their yellow limbs , and gibbering masks make sport</l>
     <l n="87">Under the moons of many-coloured light</l>
     <l n="88">That swing their lantern-fruitage in the night</l>
     <l n="89">Of overarching trees . To him it seems</l>
     <l n="90">An alien world , peopled by insane dreams .</l>
     <l n="91">But these are nothing to the monstrous shapes —</l>
     <l n="92">Not men so much as bastardy of apes —</l>
     <l n="93">That meet his eyes in Africa . Between</l>
     <l n="94">Leaves of grey fungoid pulp and poisonous green ,</l>
     <l n="95">White eyes from black and browless faces stare .</l>
     <l n="96">Dryads with star-flowers in their woolly hair</l>
     <l n="97">Dance to the flaccid clapping of their own</l>
     <l n="98">Black dangling dugs through forests overgrown ,</l>
     <l n="99">Platted with writhing creepers . Horrified ,</l>
     <l n="100">He sees them how they leap and dance , or glide ,</l>
     <l n="101">Glimpse after black glimpse of a satin skin ,</l>
     <l n="102">Among unthinkable flowers , to pause and grin</l>
     <l n="103">Out through a trellis of suppurating lips ,</l>
     <l n="104">Of mottled tentacles barbed at the tips</l>
     <l n="105">And bloated hands and wattles and red lobes</l>
     <l n="106">Of pendulous gristle and enormous probes</l>
     <l n="107">Of pink and slashed and tasselled flesh . . .</l>
     <l n="108">He turns</l>
     <l n="109">Northward his sickened sight . The desert burns</l>
     <l n="110">All life away . Here in the forkéd shade</l>
     <l n="111">Of twin-humped towering dromedaries laid ,</l>
     <l n="112">A few gaunt folk are sleeping : fierce they seem</l>
     <l n="113">Even in sleep , and restless as they dream .</l>
     <l n="114">He would be fearful of a desert bride</l>
     <l n="115">As of a brown asp at his sleeping side ,</l>
     <l n="116">Fearful of her white teeth and cunning arts .</l>
     <l n="117">Further , yet further , to the ultimate parts</l>
     <l n="118">Of the wide earth he looks , where Britons go</l>
     <l n="119">Painted among their swamps , and through the snow</l>
     <l n="120">Huge hairy snuffling beasts pursue their prey —</l>
     <l n="121">Fierce men , as hairy and as huge as they .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="122">Bewildered furrows deepen the Thunderer ’ s scowl ;</l>
     <l n="123">This world so vast , so variously foul —</l>
     <l n="124">Who can have made its ugliness ? In what</l>
     <l n="125">Revolting fancy were the Forms begot</l>
     <l n="126">Of all these monsters ? What strange deity —</l>
     <l n="127">So barbarously not a Greek !— was he</l>
     <l n="128">Who could mismake such beings in his own</l>
     <l n="129">Distorted image . Nay , the Greeks alone</l>
     <l n="130">Were men ; in Greece alone were bodies fair ,</l>
     <l n="131">Minds comely . In that all-but-island there ,</l>
     <l n="132">Cleaving the blue sea with its promontories ,</l>
     <l n="133">Lies the world ’ s hope , the seed of all the glories</l>
     <l n="134">That are to be ; there , too , must surely live</l>
     <l n="135">She who alone can medicinably give</l>
     <l n="136">Ease with her beauty to the Thunderer ’ s pain .</l>
     <l n="137">Downwards he bends his fiery eyes again ,</l>
     <l n="138">Glaring on Hellas . Like a beam of light ,</l>
     <l n="139">His intent glances touch the mountain height</l>
     <l n="140">With passing flame and probe the valleys deep ,</l>
     <l n="141">Rift the dense forest and the age-old sleep</l>
     <l n="142">Of vaulted antres on whose pebbly floor</l>
     <l n="143">Gallop the loud-hoofed Centaurs ; and the roar</l>
     <l n="144">Of more than human shouting underground</l>
     <l n="145">Pulses in living palpable waves of sound</l>
     <l n="146">From wall to wall , until it rumbles out</l>
     <l n="147">Into the air ; and at that hollow shout</l>
     <l n="148">That seems an utterance of the whole vast hill ,</l>
     <l n="149">The shepherds cease their laughter and are still .</l>
     <l n="150">Cities asleep under the noonday sky</l>
     <l n="151">Stir at the passage of his burning eye ;</l>
     <l n="152">And in their huts the startled peasants blink</l>
     <l n="153">At the swift flash that bursts through every chink</l>
     <l n="154">Of wattled walls , hearkening in fearful wonder</l>
     <l n="155">Through lengthened seconds for the crash of thunder —</l>
     <l n="156">Which follows not : they are the more afraid .</l>
     <l n="157">Jove seeks amain . Many a country maid ,</l>
     <l n="158">Whose sandalled feet pass down familiar ways</l>
     <l n="159">Among the olives , but whose spirit strays</l>
     <l n="160">Through lovelier lands of fancy , suddenly</l>
     <l n="161">Starts broad awake out of her dream to see</l>
     <l n="162">A light that is not of the sun , a light</l>
     <l n="163">Darted by living eyes , consciously bright ;</l>
     <l n="164">She sees and feels it like a subtle flame</l>
     <l n="165">Mantling her limbs with fear and maiden shame</l>
     <l n="166">And strange desire . Longing and terrified ,</l>
     <l n="167">She hides her face , like a new-wedded bride</l>
     <l n="168">Who feels rough hands that seize and hold her fast ;</l>
     <l n="169">And swooning falls . The terrible light has passed ;</l>
     <l n="170">She wakes ; the sun still shines , the olive trees</l>
     <l n="171">Tremble to whispering silver in the breeze</l>
     <l n="172">And all is as it was , save she alone</l>
     <l n="173">In whose dazed eyes this deathless light has shone :</l>
     <l n="174">For never , never from this day forth will she</l>
     <l n="175">In earth ’ s poor passion find felicity ,</l>
     <l n="176">Or love of mortal man . A god ’ s desire</l>
     <l n="177">Has seared her soul ; nought but the same strong fire</l>
     <l n="178">Can kindle the dead ash to life again ,</l>
     <l n="179">And all her years will be a lonely pain .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="180">Many a thousand had he looked upon ,</l>
     <l n="181">Thousands of mortals , young and old ; but none —</l>
     <l n="182">Virgin , or young ephebus , or the flower</l>
     <l n="183">Of womanhood culled in its full-blown hour —</l>
     <l n="184">Could please the Thunderer ’ s sight or touch his mind ;</l>
     <l n="185">The longed-for loveliness was yet to find .</l>
     <l n="186">Had beauty fled , and was there nothing fair</l>
     <l n="187">Under the moon ? The fury of despair</l>
     <l n="188">Raged in the breast of heaven ’ s Almighty Lord ;</l>
     <l n="189">He gnashed his foamy teeth and rolled and roared</l>
     <l n="190">In bull-like agony . Then a great calm</l>
     <l n="191">Descended on him : cool and healing balm</l>
     <l n="192">Touched his immortal fury . He had spied</l>
     <l n="193">Young Leda where she stood , poised on the river-side .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="194">Even as she broke the river ’ s smooth expanse ,</l>
     <l n="195">Leda was conscious of that hungry glance ,</l>
     <l n="196">And knew it for an eye of fearful power</l>
     <l n="197">That did so hot and thunderously lour ,</l>
     <l n="198">She knew not whence , on her frail nakedness .</l>
     <l n="199">Jove ’ s heart held but one thought : he must possess</l>
     <l n="200">That perfect form or die — possess or die .</l>
     <l n="201">Unheeded prayers and supplications fly ,</l>
     <l n="202">Thick as a flock of birds , about his ears ,</l>
     <l n="203">And smoke of incense rises ; but he hears</l>
     <l n="204">Nought but the soft falls of that melody</l>
     <l n="205">Which is the speech of Leda ; he can see</l>
     <l n="206">Nought but that almost spiritual grace</l>
     <l n="207">Which is her body , and that heavenly face</l>
     <l n="208">Where gay , sweet thoughts shine through , and eyes are bright</l>
     <l n="209">With purity and the soul ’ s inward light .</l>
     <l n="210">Have her he must : the teasel-fingered burr</l>
     <l n="211">Sticks not so fast in a wild beast ’ s tangled fur</l>
     <l n="212">As that insistent longing in the soul</l>
     <l n="213">Of mighty Jove . Gods , men , earth , heaven , the whole</l>
     <l n="214">Vast universe was blotted from his thought</l>
     <l n="215">And nought remained but Leda ’ s laughter , nought</l>
     <l n="216">But Leda ’ s eyes . Magnified by his lust ,</l>
     <l n="217">She was the whole world now ; have her he must , he must . . .</l>
     <l n="218">His spirit worked ; how should he gain his end</l>
     <l n="219">With most deliciousness ? What better friend ,</l>
     <l n="220">What counsellor more subtle could he find</l>
     <l n="221">Than lovely Aphrodite , ever kind</l>
     <l n="222">To hapless lovers , ever cunning , too ,</l>
     <l n="223">In all the tortuous ways of love to do</l>
     <l n="224">And plan the best ? To Paphos then ! His will</l>
     <l n="225">And act were one ; and straight , invisible ,</l>
     <l n="226">He stood in Paphos , breathing the languid air</l>
     <l n="227">By Aphrodite ’ s couch . O heavenly fair</l>
     <l n="228">She was , and smooth and marvellously young !</l>
     <l n="229">On Tyrian silk she lay , and purple hung</l>
     <l n="230">About her bed in folds of fluted light</l>
     <l n="231">And shadow , dark as wine . Two doves , more white</l>
     <l n="232">Even than the white hand on the purple lying</l>
     <l n="233">Like a pale flower wearily dropped , were flying</l>
     <l n="234">With wings that made an odoriferous stir ,</l>
     <l n="235">Dropping faint dews of bakkaris and myrrh ,</l>
     <l n="236">Musk and the soul of sweet flowers cunningly</l>
     <l n="237">Ravished from transient petals as they die .</l>
     <l n="238">Two stripling cupids on her either hand</l>
     <l n="239">Stood near with winnowing plumes and gently fanned</l>
     <l n="240">Her hot , love-fevered cheeks and eyelids burning .</l>
     <l n="241">Another , crouched at the bed ’ s foot , was turning</l>
     <l n="242">A mass of scattered parchments — vows or plaints</l>
     <l n="243">Or glad triumphant thanks which Venus ’ saints ,</l>
     <l n="244">Martyrs and heroes , on her altars strewed</l>
     <l n="245">With bitterest tears or gifts of gratitude .</l>
     <l n="246">From the pile heaped at Aphrodite ’ s feet</l>
     <l n="247">The boy would take a leaf , and in his sweet ,</l>
     <l n="248">Clear voice would read what mortal tongues can tell</l>
     <l n="249">In stammering verse of those ineffable</l>
     <l n="250">Pleasures and pains of love , heaven and uttermost hell .</l>
     <l n="251">Jove hidden stood and heard him read these lines</l>
     <l n="252">Of votive thanks —</l>
     <l n="253">Cypris , this little silver lamp to thee</l>
     <l n="254">I dedicate .</l>
     <l n="255">It was my fellow-watcher , shared with me</l>
     <l n="256">Those swift , short hours , when raised above my fate</l>
     <l n="257">In Sphenura ’ s white arms I drank</l>
     <l n="258">Of immortality .</l>
     <l n="259">“ A pretty lamp , and I will have it placed</l>
     <l n="260">Beside the narrow bed of some too chaste</l>
     <l n="261">Sister of virgin Artemis , to be</l>
     <l n="262">A night-long witness of her cruelty .</l>
     <l n="263">Read me another , boy ,” and Venus bent</l>
     <l n="264">Her ear to listen to this short lament .</l>
     <l n="265">Cypris , Cypris , I am betrayed !</l>
     <l n="266">Under the same wide mantle laid</l>
     <l n="267">I found them , faithless , shameless pair !</l>
     <l n="268">Making love with tangled hair .</l>
     <l n="269">“ Alas ,” the goddess cried , “ nor god , nor man ,</l>
     <l n="270">Nor medicinable balm , nor magic can</l>
     <l n="271">Cast out the demon jealousy , whose breath</l>
     <l n="272">Withers the rose of life , save only time and death .”</l>
     <l n="273">Another sheet he took and read again .</l>
     <l n="274">Farewell to love , and hail the long , slow pain</l>
     <l n="275">Of memory that backward turns to joy .</l>
     <l n="276">O I have danced enough and enough sung ;</l>
     <l n="277">My feet shall be still now and my voice mute ;</l>
     <l n="278">Thine are these withered wreaths , this Lydian flute ,</l>
     <l n="279">Cypris ; I once was young .</l>
     <l n="280">And piêtous Aphrodite wept to think</l>
     <l n="281">How fadingly upon death ’ s very brink</l>
     <l n="282">Beauty and love take hands for one short kiss —</l>
     <l n="283">And then the wreaths are dust , the bright-eyed bliss</l>
     <l n="284">Perished , and the flute still . “ Read on , read on .”</l>
     <l n="285">But ere the page could start , a lightning shone</l>
     <l n="286">Suddenly through the room , and they were ’ ware</l>
     <l n="287">Of some great terrible presence looming there .</l>
     <l n="288">And it took shape — huge limbs , whose every line</l>
     <l n="289">A symbol was of power and strength divine ,</l>
     <l n="290">And it was Jove .</l>
     <l n="291">“ Daughter , I come ,” said he ,</l>
     <l n="292">“ For counsel in a case that touches me</l>
     <l n="293">Close , to the very life .” And he straightway</l>
     <l n="294">Told her of all his restlessness that day</l>
     <l n="295">And of his sight of Leda , and how great</l>
     <l n="296">Was his desire . And so in close debate</l>
     <l n="297">Sat the two gods , planning their rape ; while she ,</l>
     <l n="298">Who was to be their victim , joyously</l>
     <l n="299">Laughed like a child in the sudden breathless chill</l>
     <l n="300">And splashed and swam , forgetting every ill</l>
     <l n="301">And every fear and all , save only this :</l>
     <l n="302">That she was young , and it was perfect bliss</l>
     <l n="303">To be alive where suns so goldenly shine ,</l>
     <l n="304">And bees go drunk with fragrant honey-wine ,</l>
     <l n="305">And the cicadas sing from morn till night ,</l>
     <l n="306">And rivers run so cool and pure and bright . . .</l>
     <l n="307">Stretched all her length , arms under head , she lay</l>
     <l n="308">In the deep grass , while the sun kissed away</l>
     <l n="309">The drops that sleeked her skin . Slender and fine</l>
     <l n="310">As those old images of the gods that shine</l>
     <l n="311">With smooth-worn silver , polished through the years</l>
     <l n="312">By the touching lips of countless worshippers ,</l>
     <l n="313">Her body was ; and the sun ’ s golden heat</l>
     <l n="314">Clothed her in softest flame from head to feet</l>
     <l n="315">And was her mantle , that she scarcely knew</l>
     <l n="316">The conscious sense of nakedness . The blue ,</l>
     <l n="317">Far hills and the faint fringes of the sky</l>
     <l n="318">Shimmered and pulsed in the heat uneasily ,</l>
     <l n="319">And hidden in the grass , cicadas shrill</l>
     <l n="320">Dizzied the air with ceaseless noise , until</l>
     <l n="321">A listener might wonder if they cried</l>
     <l n="322">In his own head or in the world outside .</l>
     <l n="323">Sometimes she shut her eyelids , and wrapped round</l>
     <l n="324">In a red darkness , with the muffled sound</l>
     <l n="325">And throb of blood beating within her brain ,</l>
     <l n="326">Savoured intensely to the verge of pain</l>
     <l n="327">Her own young life , hoarded it up behind</l>
     <l n="328">Her shuttered lids , until , too long confined ,</l>
     <l n="329">It burst them open and her prisoned soul</l>
     <l n="330">Flew forth and took possession of the whole</l>
     <l n="331">Exquisite world about her and was made</l>
     <l n="332">A part of it . Meanwhile her maidens played ,</l>
     <l n="333">Singing an ancient song of death and birth ,</l>
     <l n="334">Seed-time and harvest , old as the grey earth ,</l>
     <l n="335">And moving to their music in a dance</l>
     <l n="336">As immemorial . A numbing trance</l>
     <l n="337">Came gradually over her , as though</l>
     <l n="338">Flake after downy-feathered flake of snow</l>
     <l n="339">Had muffled all her senses , drifting deep</l>
     <l n="340">And warm and quiet .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="341">From this all-but sleep</l>
     <l n="342">She started into life again ; the sky</l>
     <l n="343">Was full of a strange tumult suddenly —</l>
     <l n="344">Beating of mighty wings and shrill-voiced fear</l>
     <l n="345">And the hoarse scream of rapine following near .</l>
     <l n="346">In the high windlessness above her flew ,</l>
     <l n="347">Dazzlingly white on the untroubled blue ,</l>
     <l n="348">A splendid swan , with outstretched neck and wing</l>
     <l n="349">Spread fathom wide , and closely following</l>
     <l n="350">An eagle , tawny and black . This god-like pair</l>
     <l n="351">Circled and swooped through the calm of upper air ,</l>
     <l n="352">The eagle striking and the white swan still</l>
     <l n="353">’ Scaping as though by happy miracle</l>
     <l n="354">The imminent talons . For the twentieth time</l>
     <l n="355">The furious hunter stooped , to miss and climb</l>
     <l n="356">A mounting spiral into the height again .</l>
     <l n="357">He hung there poised , eyeing the grassy plain</l>
     <l n="358">Far , far beneath , where the girls ’ upturned faces</l>
     <l n="359">Were like white flowers that bloom in open places</l>
     <l n="360">Among the scarcely budded woods . And they</l>
     <l n="361">Breathlessly watched and waited ; long he lay ,</l>
     <l n="362">Becalmed upon that tideless sea of light ,</l>
     <l n="363">While the great swan with slow and creaking flight</l>
     <l n="364">Went slanting down towards safety , where the stream</l>
     <l n="365">Shines through the trees below , with glance and gleam</l>
     <l n="366">Of blue aerial eyes that seem to give</l>
     <l n="367">Sense to the sightless earth and make it live .</l>
     <l n="368">The ponderous wings beat on and no pursuit :</l>
     <l n="369">Stiff as the painted kite that guards the fruit ,</l>
     <l n="370">Afloat o ’ er orchards ripe , the eagle yet</l>
     <l n="371">Hung as at anchor , seeming to forget</l>
     <l n="372">His uncaught prey , his rage unsatisfied .</l>
     <l n="373">Still , quiet , dead . . . and then the quickest-eyed</l>
     <l n="374">Had lost him . Like a star unsphered , a stone</l>
     <l n="375">Dropped from the vault of heaven , a javelin thrown ,</l>
     <l n="376">He swooped upon his prey . Down , down he came ,</l>
     <l n="377">And through his plumes with a noise of wind-blown flame</l>
     <l n="378">Loud roared the air . From Leda ’ s lips a cry</l>
     <l n="379">Broke , and she hid her face — she could not see him die ,</l>
     <l n="380">Her lovely , hapless swan .</l>
     <l n="381">Ah , had she heard ,</l>
     <l n="382">Even as the eagle hurtled past , the word</l>
     <l n="383">That treacherous pair exchanged . “ Peace ,” cried the swan ;</l>
     <l n="384">“ Peace , daughter . All my strength will soon be gone ,</l>
     <l n="385">Wasted in tedious flying , ere I come</l>
     <l n="386">Where my desire hath set its only home .”</l>
     <l n="387">“ Go ,” said the eagle , “ I have played my part ,</l>
     <l n="388">Roused pity for your plight in Leda ’ s heart</l>
     <l n="389">( Pity the mother of voluptuousness ) .</l>
     <l n="390">Go , father Jove ; be happy ; for success</l>
     <l n="391">Attends this moment .”</l>
     <l n="392">On the queen ’ s numbed sense</l>
     <l n="393">Fell a glad shout that ended sick suspense ,</l>
     <l n="394">Bidding her lift once more towards the light</l>
     <l n="395">Her eyes , by pity closed against a sight</l>
     <l n="396">Of blood and death — her eyes , how happy now</l>
     <l n="397">To see the swan still safe , while far below ,</l>
     <l n="398">Brought by the force of his eluded stroke</l>
     <l n="399">So near to earth that with his wings he woke</l>
     <l n="400">A gust whose sudden silvery motion stirred</l>
     <l n="401">The meadow grass , struggled the sombre bird</l>
     <l n="402">Of rage and rapine . Loud his scream and hoarse</l>
     <l n="403">With baffled fury as he urged his course</l>
     <l n="404">Upwards again on threshing pinions wide .</l>
     <l n="405">But the fair swan , not daring to abide</l>
     <l n="406">This last assault , dropped with the speed of fear</l>
     <l n="407">Towards the river . Like a winged spear ,</l>
     <l n="408">Outstretching his long neck , rigid and straight ,</l>
     <l n="409">Aimed at where Leda on the bank did wait</l>
     <l n="410">With open arms and kind , uplifted eyes</l>
     <l n="411">And voice of tender pity , down he flies .</l>
     <l n="412">Nearer , nearer , terribly swift , he sped</l>
     <l n="413">Directly at the queen ; then widely spread</l>
     <l n="414">Resisting wings , and breaking his descent</l>
     <l n="415">’ Gainst his own wind , all speed and fury spent ,</l>
     <l n="416">The great swan fluttered slowly down to rest</l>
     <l n="417">And sweet security on Leda ’ s breast .</l>
     <l n="418">Menacingly the eagle wheeled above her ;</l>
     <l n="419">But Leda , like a noble-hearted lover</l>
     <l n="420">Keeping his child-beloved from tyrannous harm ,</l>
     <l n="421">Stood o ’ er the swan and , with one slender arm</l>
     <l n="422">Imperiously lifted , waved away</l>
     <l n="423">The savage foe , still hungry for his prey .</l>
     <l n="424">Baffled at last , he mounted out of sight</l>
     <l n="425">And the sky was void — save for a single white</l>
     <l n="426">Swan ’ s feather moulted from a harassed wing</l>
     <l n="427">That down , down , with a rhythmic balancing</l>
     <l n="428">From side to side dropped sleeping on the air .</l>
     <l n="429">Down , slowly down over that dazzling pair ,</l>
     <l n="430">Whose different grace in union was a birth</l>
     <l n="431">Of unimagined beauty on the earth :</l>
     <l n="432">So lovely that the maidens standing round</l>
     <l n="433">Dared scarcely look . Couched on the flowery ground</l>
     <l n="434">Young Leda lay , and to her side did press</l>
     <l n="435">The swan ’ s proud-arching opulent loveliness ,</l>
     <l n="436">Stroking the snow-soft plumage of his breast</l>
     <l n="437">With fingers slowly drawn , themselves caressed</l>
     <l n="438">By the warm softness where they lingered , loth</l>
     <l n="439">To break away . Sometimes against their growth</l>
     <l n="440">Ruffling the feathers inlaid like little scales</l>
     <l n="441">On his sleek neck , the pointed finger-nails</l>
     <l n="442">Rasped on the warm , dry , puckered skin beneath ;</l>
     <l n="443">And feeling it she shuddered , and her teeth</l>
     <l n="444">Grated on edge ; for there was something strange</l>
     <l n="445">And snake-like in the touch . He , in exchange ,</l>
     <l n="446">Gave back to her , stretching his eager neck ,</l>
     <l n="447">For every kiss a little amorous peck ;</l>
     <l n="448">Rubbing his silver head on her gold tresses ,</l>
     <l n="449">And with the nip of horny dry caresses</l>
     <l n="450">Leaving upon her young white breast and cheek</l>
     <l n="451">And arms the red print of his playful beak .</l>
     <l n="452">Closer he nestled , mingling with the slim</l>
     <l n="453">Austerity of virginal flank and limb</l>
     <l n="454">His curved and florid beauty , till she felt</l>
     <l n="455">That downy warmth strike through her flesh and melt</l>
     <l n="456">The bones and marrow of her strength away .</l>
     <l n="457">One lifted arm bent o ’ er her brow , she lay</l>
     <l n="458">With limbs relaxed , scarce breathing , deathly still ;</l>
     <l n="459">Save when a quick , involuntary thrill</l>
     <l n="460">Shook her sometimes with passing shudderings ,</l>
     <l n="461">As though some hand had plucked the aching strings</l>
     <l n="462">Of life itself , tense with expectancy .</l>
     <l n="463">And over her the swan shook slowly free</l>
     <l n="464">The folded glory of his wings , and made</l>
     <l n="465">A white-walled tent of soft and luminous shade</l>
     <l n="466">To be her veil and keep her from the shame</l>
     <l n="467">Of naked light and the sun ’ s noonday flame .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="468">Hushed lay the earth and the wide , careless sky .</l>
     <l n="469">Then one sharp sound , that might have been a cry</l>
     <l n="470">Of utmost pleasure or of utmost pain ,</l>
     <l n="471">Broke sobbing forth , and all was still again .</l>

   <p>But I happened to look inwards among the machinery of our roundabout , and there I saw a slobbering cretin grinding at a wheel and sweating as he ground , and grinding eternally . And when I perceived that he was the author of all our speed and that the music was of his making , that everything depended on his grinding wheel , I thought I would like to get off . But we were going too fast .</p>

    <head>BACK STREETS</head>
    <head>BACK streets , gutters of stagnating darkness where men breathe something that is not so much air as a kind of rarefied slime . . . . I look back down the tunnelled darkness of a drain to where , at the mouth , a broader , windier water-way glitters with the gay speed and motion of sunlit life . But around all is dimly rotting ; and the inhabitants are those squamous , phosphorescent creatures that darkness and decay beget . Little men , sheathed tightly in clothes of an exaggeratedly fashionable cheapness , hurry along the pavements , jaunty and at the same time furtive . There is a thin layer of slime over all of them . And then there are the eyes of the women , with their hard glitter that is only of the surface . They see acutely , but in a glassy , superficial way , taking in the objects round them no more than my western windows retain the imprint of the sunset that enriches them .</head>
     <l n="1">Back streets , exhalations of a difficulty puberty , I once lived on the</l>

    <head>LAST THINGS</head>
    <head>THERE have been visions , dark in the minds of men , death and corruption dancing across the secular abyss that separates eternity from time to where sits the ineluctable judge , waiting , waiting through the ages , and ponders all his predestinated decrees . There will be judgment , and each , in an agony of shame , reluctant yet compelled , will turn his own accuser . For</head>

   <p>There under the unwinking gaze of all the legions of just men made perfect , the poor prisoner will uncover each dirty secret of his heart , will act over again each shameful scene of his life . And those eyes of saints and angels will shine impassively down upon his beastliness , and to him , as he looks at their steady brilliance , they will seem a million of little blazing loopholes slotted in the walls of hell .</p>
   <p>Hildebert , this was your vision as you brooded over death and judgment , hell and heaven , in your cloister , a thousand years ago . Do you not envy us our peace of mind who know not four ultimates , but only one ? For whom the first of the Last Things is also the last — us , whom death annihilates with all our shame and all our folly , leaving no trace behind .</p>

   <p>Along the bellying clouds the little boys of London Town come running , running as best they may , seeing that at every step they sink ankle-deep through the woolly surface into the black heart of thunder beneath .</p>
   <p>The apples on the trees are swaying in the wind , rocking to the clamour of bells . The leaves are of bright green copper , and rattle together with a scaly sound . At the roots of the tree sit four gargoyles playing a little serious game with dice . The hunch-backed ape has won from the manticore that crooked French crown with a hole in it which the manticore got from the friar with the strawberry nose ; he had it in turn as an alms from the grave knight who lies with crossed legs down there , through the clouds and the dizzy mist of bell-ringing , where the great church is a hollow ship , full of bright candles , and stable in the midst of dark tempestuous seas .</p>

    <head>Sans Espoir . . .

   <p>Flickering , snickering — candles , you betrayed me . I had to laugh too .</p>
   <p>BEAUTY I</p>
   <p>THERE is a sea somewhere — whether in the lampless crypts of the earth , or among sunlit islands , or that which is an unfathomable and terrifying question between the archipelagos of stars — there is a sea ( and perhaps its tides have filled those green transparent pools that glint like eyes in a spring storm-cloud ) which is for ever troubled and in travail — a bubbling and a heaving up of waters as though for the birth of a fountain .</p>
   <p>The sick and the crippled lie along the brims in expectation of the miracle . And at last , at last . . .</p>
   <p>A funnel of white water is twisted up and so stands , straight and still by the very speed of its motion .</p>
   <p>It drinks the light ; slowly it is infused with colour , rose and mother-of-pearl . Slowly it takes shape , a heavenly body .</p>
   <p>O dazzling Anadyomene !</p>
   <p>The flakes of foam break into white birds about her head , fall again in a soft avalanche of flowers . Perpetual miracle , beauty endlessly born .</p>
   <p>II</p>
   <p>STEAMERS , in all your travelling have you trailed the meshes of your long expiring white nets across this sea , or dipped in it your sliding rail , or balanced your shadow far far down upon its glass-green sand ? Or , forgetting the preoccupations of commerce and the well-oiled predestination of your machinery , did you ever put in at the real Paphos ?</p>
    <p>III</p>
   <p>IN the city of Troy , whither our Argonautical voyages had carried us , we found Helen and that lamentable Cressid who was to Chaucer the feminine paradox , untenably fantastic but so devastatingly actual , the crystal ideal — flawed ; and to Shakespeare the inevitable trull , flayed to show her physiological machinery and the logical conclusion of every the most heartrendingly ingenuous gesture of maidenhood . ( But , bless you ! our gorge doesn ’ t rise . We are cynically well up in the damning Theory of woman , which makes it all the more amusing to watch ourselves in the ecstatic practice of her . Unforeseen perversity . )</p>
   <p>Fabulous Helen ! At her firm breasts they used to mould delicate drinking cups which made the sourest vinegar richly poisonous .</p>
   <p>The geometry of her body had utterly outwitted Euclid , and the Philosophers were baffled by curves of a subtlety infinitely more elusive and Eleusinian than the most oracular speculations of Parmenides . They did their best to make a coherent system out of the incompatible , but empirically established , facts of her . Time , for instance , was abolished within the circle of her arms . “ It is eternity when her lips touch me ,” Paris had remarked . And yet this same Paris was manifestly and notoriously falling into a decline , had lost whatever sense or beauty he once possessed , together with his memory and all skill in the nine arts which are memory ’ s daughters . How was it then , these perplexed philosophers wondered , that she could at one and the same moment give eternity like a goddess , while she was vampiring away with that divine thirsty mouth of hers the last dregs of a poor mortal life ? They sought an insufficient refuge in Heraclitus ’ theory of opposites .</p>
   <p>Meanwhile Troilus was always to be found at sunset , pacing up and down the walls by the western gate — quite mad . At dusk the Greek camp-fires would blossom along Xanthus banks — one after another , a myriad lights dancing in the dark .</p>

   <p>IV</p>
   <p>THERE are fine cities in the world — Manhattan , Ecbatana and Hecatompylus — but this city of Troy is the most fabulous of them all . Rome was seven hills of butcher ’ s meat , Athens an abstraction of marble , in Alexandria the steam of kidney-puddings revolted the cœnobites , darkness and size render London inappreciable , Paris is full of sparrows , the snow lies gritty on Berlin , Moscow has no verisimilitude , all the East is peopled by masks and apes and larvæ . But this city of Troy is most of all real and fabulous with its charnel beauty .</p>
   <p>“ Is not Helen the end of our search — paradisal little World , symbol and epitome of the Great ? Dawn sleeps in the transparent shadow of roses within her ear . The stainless candour of infinity — far-off peaks in summer and the Milky Way — has taken marvellous form in her . The Little World has its meteors , too , comets and shadowy clouds of hair , stars at whose glance men go planet-struck . Meteors — yes , and history it has . The past is still alive in the fragrance of her hair , and her young body breathes forth memories as old as the beginning of life — Eros first of gods . In her is the goal . I rest here with Helen .”</p>
   <p>“ Fool ,” I said , “ quote your Faustus . I go further .”</p>
   <p>V</p>
   <p>FURTHER — but a hundred Liliputian tethers prevent me , the white nerves which tie soul to skin . And the whole air is aching with epidermical magnetism .</p>
   <p>Further , further . But Troy is the birthplace of my homesickness . Troy is more than a patriotism , for it is built of my very flesh ; the remembrance of it is a fire that sticks and tears when I would pull it off .</p>
   <p>But further . One last look at Troilus where he stands by the western gate , staring over the plain . Further . When I have learnt the truth , I will return and build a new palace with domes less ominously like breasts , and there I will invent a safer Helen and a less paradoxical Cressid , and my harem will be a library for enlightenment .</p>
   <p>VI</p>
   <p>HERE are pagodas of diminishing bells . The leopard sleeps in the depth of his rosy cavern , and when he breathes it is a smell of irresistible sweetness ; in the bestiaries he is the symbol of Christ in His sepulchre .</p>
   <p>This listening conch has collected all the rumours of pantheism ; the dew in this veined cup is the sacrament of nature , while these pale thuribles worship in the dark with yellow lamps and incense .</p>
   <p>Everywhere alchemical profusion — the golden mintage of glades and ripples , vigils of passion enriched with silver under the fingers of the moon ; everywhere lavishness , colour , music ; the smoothness of machinery , incredible and fantastic ingenuities . God has lost his half-hunter in the desert .</p>
   <p>But we have not come to worship among these Gothic beeches , for all their pillars and the lace-work of their green windows . We are looking for other things than churches .</p>
   <p>VII</p>
   <p>TREES , the half-fossilised exuberances of a passionate life , petrified fountains of intemperance — with their abolition begins the realm of reason .</p>
   <p>Geometry , lines and planes , smooth edges , the ordered horror of perspectives . In this country there are pavements bright and sleek as water . The walls are precipices to which giants have nailed a perpetual cataract of marble . The fringes of the sky are scalloped with a pattern of domes and minarets . At night , too , the down-struck lamps are pyramids of phantom green and the perfect circle they make upon the pavement is magical .</p>
   <p>Look over the parapet of the Acropolis . The bridges go dizzily down on their swaying catenaries , the gull ’ s flight chained fast . The walls drop clear into the valley , all the millions of basalt blocks calcined into a single red monolith , fluted with thirstily shining organ pipes , which seem for ever wet . There are no crevices for moss and toadflax , and even the claws of the yellow lichen slip on its polished flanks .</p>
   <p>The valley is all paved and inlaid with rivers of steel . No trees , for they have been abolished .</p>
   <p>“ Glorious unnature ,” cries the watcher at the parapet . His voice launches into the abyss , following the curve of the bridges . “ Glorious unnature . We have triumphed .”</p>
   <p>But his laughter as it descends is like a flight of broken steps .</p>
   <p>VIII</p>
   <p>LET us abandon ourselves to Time , which is beauty ’ s essence . We live among the perpetual degenerations of apotheoses . Sunset dissolves into soft grey snow and the deep ocean of midnight , boundless as forgetfulness or some yet undiscovered Pacific , contracts into the green puddle of the dawn . The flowers burn to dust with their own brightness . On the banks of ancient rivers stand the pitiful stumps of huge towers and the ghosts of dead men straining to return into life . The woods are full of the smell of transience . Beauty , then , is that moment of descent when apotheosis tilts its wings downwards into the gulf . The ends of the curve lose themselves parabolically somewhere in infinity . Our sentimental eyes see only the middle section of this degeneration , knowing neither the upper nor the lower extremes , which some have thought to meet , godhead and annihilation .</p>
   <p>Old Curiosity Shops ! If I have said “ Mortality is beauty ,” it was a weakness . The sense of time is a symptom of anæmia of the soul , through which flows angelic ichor . We must escape from the dust of the shop .</p>
   <p>Cloistered darkness and sleep offer us their lotuses . Not to perceive where all is ugly , eaten into by the syphilis of time , heart-sickening — this is beauty ; not to desire where death is the only consummation — wisdom .</p>
   <p>Night is a measureless deep silence : daybreak brings back the fœtid gutters of the town . O supreme beauty of a night that knows no limitations — stars or the jagged edges of cock-crowing . Desperate , my mind has desired it : never my blood , whose pulse is a rhythm of the world .</p>
   <p>At the other extreme , Beatrice lacks solidity , is as unresponsive to your kisses as mathematics . She too is an oubliette , not a way of life ; an oubliette that , admittedly , shoots you upwards into light , not down to death ; but it comes to the same thing in the end .</p>
   <p>What , then , is the common measure ? To take the world as it is , but metaphorically , informing the chaos of nature with a soul , qualifying transience with eternity .</p>
   <p>When flowers are thoughts , and lonely poplars fountains of aspiring longing ; when our actions are the poem of which all geographies and architectures and every science and all the unclassed individual odds and ends are the words , when even Helen ’ s white voluptuousness matches some candour of the soul — then it will have been found , the permanent and living loveliness .</p>
   <p>It is not a far-fetched , dear-bought gem ; no pomander to be smelt only when the crowd becomes too stinkingly insistent ; it is not a birth of rare oboes or violins , not visible only from ten to six by state permission at a nominal charge , not a thing richly apart , but an ethic , a way of belief and of practice , of faith and works , mediæval in its implication with the very threads of life . I desire no Paphian cloister of pink monks . Rather a rosy Brotherhood of Common Life , eating , drinking ; marrying and giving in marriage ; taking and taken in adultery ; reading , thinking , and when thinking fails , feeling immeasurably more subtly , sometimes perhaps creating .</p>
   <p>Arduous search for one who is chained by his desires to dead carcases , whose eyes are dimmed with tears by the slow heart-breaking twilights full of old family ghosts laid in lavender , whose despair cries out for opiate and anodyne , craving gross sleep or a place on the airy unsupported pinnacles which hang in the sterile upper chambers of ether .</p>
   <p>Ventre à terre , head in air — your centaurs are your only poets . Their hoofs strike sparks from the flints and they see both very near and immensely far .</p>
   <p>SOLES OCCIDERE ET REDIRE POSSUNT FOREWORD</p>
   <p>JOHN RIDLEY , the subject of this poem , was killed in February 1918 . “ If I should perish ,” he wrote to me only five weeks before his death , “ if I should perish — and one isn ’ t exactly a ’ good life ’ at the moment — I wish you ’ d write something about me . It isn ’ t vanity ( for I know you ’ ll do me , if anything , rather less than justice ! ) , not vanity , I repeat ; but that queer irrational desire one has for immortality of any kind , however short and precarious — for frankly , my dear , I doubt whether your verses will be so very much more perennial than brass . Still , they ’ ll be something . One can ’ t , of course , believe in any au-delà for one ’ s personal self ; one would have first to believe in some kind of a friendly god . And as for being a spiritualist spook , one of those wretched beings who seem to spend their eternity in trying to communicate with the earth by a single telephone , where the number is always engaged , and the line chronically out of order — well , all I can say is , Heaven preserve me from such a future life . No , my only hope is you — and a damned poor guarantee for eternity . Don ’ t make of me a khaki image , I beg . I ’ d rather you simply said of me , as Erasmus did of his brother , ‘ Strenuus compotor , nec scortator ignavus .’ I sincerely hope , of course , that you won ’ t have to write the thing at all — hope not , but have very little doubt you will . Good-bye .”</p>
   <p>The following poem is a tentative and provisional attempt to comply with his request . Ridley was an adolescent , and suffered from that instability of mind “ produced by the mental conflict forced upon man by his sensitiveness to herd suggestion on the one hand and to experience on the other ” ( I quote from Mr. Trotter ’ s memorable work on Herd Instinct ) , that characteristic instability which makes adolescence so feebly sceptical , so inefficient , so profoundly unhappy . I have fished up a single day from Ridley ’ s forgotten existence . It has a bedraggled air in the sunlight , this poor wisp of Lethean weed . Fortunately , however , it will soon be allowed to drop back into the water , where we shall all , in due course , join it . “ The greater part must be content to be as though they had not been .”</p>
   <p>I BETWEEN the drawing of the blind And being aware of yet another day There came to him behind Close , pregnant eyelids , like a flame of blue , Intense , untroubled by the wind , A Mediterranean bay , Bearing a brazen beak and foamless oars To where , marmoreally smooth and bright , The steps soar up in one pure flight From the sea ’ s edge to the palace doors , That have shut , have shut their valves of bronze — And the windows too are lifeless eyes .</p>

   <p>III “ HELEN , your letter , proving , I suppose , That you exist somewhere in space , who knows ? Somewhere in time , perhaps , arrives this morning , Reminding me with a note of Lutheran warning That faith ’ s the test , not works . Works !— any fool Can do them if he tries to ; but what school Can teach one to credit the ridiculous , The palpably non-existent ? So with us , Votaries of the copulative cult , In this affair of love , quicumque vult , Whoever would be saved , must love without Adjunct of sense or reason , must not doubt Although the deity be far removed , Remote , invisible ; who is not loved Best by voluptuous works , but by the faith That lives in absence and the body ’ s death . I have no faith , and even in love remain Agnostic . Are you here ? The fact is plain , Constated by the heavenly vision of you , Maybe by the mouth ’ s warm touch ; and that I love you , I then most surely know , most painfully . But now you ’ ve robbed the temple , leaving me A poor invisibility to adore , Now that , alas , you ’ re vanished , gone . . . no more ; You take my drift . I only ask your leave To be a little unfaithful — not to you , My dear , to whom I was and will be true , But to your absence . Hence no cause to grieve ; For absence may be cheated of a kiss — Lightly and laughing — with no prejudice To the so longed-for presence , which some day Will crown the presence of Le Vostre J . ( As dear unhappy Troilus would say ) .”</p>
   <p>IV OH , the maggots , the maggots in his brains ! Words , words and words . A birth of rhymes and the strangest , The most unlikely superfœtations — New deep thoughts begot by a jingle upon a pun , New worlds glimpsed through the window of a word That has ceased , somehow , to be opaque . All the muses buzzing in his head . Autobiography crystallised under his pen , thus :</p>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ When I was young enough not to know youth ,</l>
     <l n="2">I was a Faun whose loves were Byzantine</l>
     <l n="3">Among stiff trees . Before me naked Truth</l>
     <l n="4">Creaked on her intellectual legs , divine</l>
     <l n="5">In being inhuman , and was never caught</l>

     <l n="13">The moonlight dreams and silver chords are strung ,</l>
     <l n="14">And a god ’ s hand touches the aching lyre .”</l>
     <l n="15">He read it through : a pretty , clinquant thing ,</l>
     <l n="16">Like bright spontaneous bird-song in the spring ,</l>
     <l n="17">Instinct with instinct , full of dewy freshness .</l>
     <l n="18">Yes , he had genius , if he chose to use it ;</l>
     <l n="19">If he chose to — but it was too much trouble ,</l>
     <l n="20">And he preferred reading . He lit his pipe ,</l>
     <l n="21">Opened his book , plunged in and soon was drowned</l>
     <l n="22">In pleasant seas . . . to rise again and find</l>
     <l n="23">One o ’ clock struck and his unshaven face</l>
     <l n="24">Still like a record in a musical box ,</l>
     <l n="25">And Auntie Loo miles off in Bloomsbury .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>V I . THE Open Sesame of “ Master John ,” And then the broad silk bosom of Aunt Loo . “ Dear John , this is a pleasure . How are you ?” “ Well , thanks . Where ’ s Uncle Will ?” “ Your uncle ’ s gone To Bath for his lumbago . He gets on As well as anyone can hope to do At his age — for you know he ’ s seventy-two ; But still , he does his bit . He sits upon</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">The local Tribunal at home , and takes</l>
     <l n="2">Parties of wounded soldiers out in brakes</l>
     <l n="3">To see the country . And three times a week</l>
     <l n="4">He still goes up to business in the City ;</l>
     <l n="5">And then , sometimes , at night he has to speak</l>
     <l n="6">In Village Halls for the War Aims Committee .”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>II . “ Well , have you any news about the war ? What do they say in France ?” “ I daren ’ t repeat The things they say .” “ You see we ’ ve got some meat For you , dear John . Really , I think before To-day I ’ ve had no lamb this year . We score By getting decent vegetables to eat , Sent up from home . This is a good receipt : The touch of garlic makes it . Have some more .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Poor Tom was wounded on the twenty-third ;</l>
     <l n="2">Did you know that ? And just to-day I heard</l>
     <l n="3">News from your uncle that his nephew James</l>
     <l n="4">Is dead — Matilda ’ s eldest boy .” “ I knew</l>
     <l n="5">One of those boys , but I ’ m so bad at names .</l>
     <l n="6">Mine had red hair .” “ Oh , now , that must be Hugh .”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>III . “ Colonel McGillicuddy came to dine Quietly here , a night or two ago . He ’ s on the Staff and very much in the know About all sorts of things . His special line Is Tanks . He says we ’ ve got a new design Of super-Tank , with big guns , that can go ( I think he said ) at thirty miles or so An hour . That ought to make them whine</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">For peace . He also said , if I remember ,</l>
     <l n="2">That the war couldn ’ t last beyond September ,</l>
     <l n="3">Because the Germans ’ trucks were wearing out</l>
     <l n="4">And couldn ’ t be replaced . I only hope</l>
     <l n="5">It ’ s true . You know your uncle has no doubt</l>
     <l n="6">That the whole thing was plotted by the Pope . . .”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="7">“. . . Good-bye , dear John . We have had a nice talk .</l>
     <l n="8">You must soon come again . Good-bye , good-bye . . . .”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">He tottered forth , full of the melancholy</l>
     <l n="10">That comes of surfeit , and began to walk</l>
     <l n="11">Slowly towards Oxford Street . The brazen sky</l>
     <l n="12">Burned overhead . Beneath his feet the stones</l>
     <l n="13">Were a grey incandescence , and his bones</l>
     <l n="14">Melted within him , and his bowels yearned .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>VI THE crowd , the crowd — oh , he could almost cry To see those myriad faces hurrying by , And each a strong tower rooted in the past On dark unknown foundations , each made fast With locks nobody knew the secret of , No key could open : save that perhaps love Might push the bars half back and just peep in — And see strange sights , it may be . But for him They were locked donjons , every window bright With beckoning mystery ; and then , Good Night ! The lamp was out , they were passed , they were gone For ever . . . ever . And one might have been The hero or the friend long sought , and one Was the loveliest face his eyes had ever seen , ( Vanished as soon ) and he went lonely on .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Then in a sudden fearful vision he saw</l>
     <l n="2">The whole world spread before him — a vast sphere</l>
     <l n="3">Of seething atoms moving to one law :</l>
     <l n="4">“ Be individual . Approach , draw near ,</l>
     <l n="5">Yes , even touch : but never join , never be</l>
     <l n="6">Other than your own selves eternally .”</l>
     <l n="7">And there are tangents , tangents of thought that aim</l>
     <l n="8">Out through the gaps between the patterned stars</l>
     <l n="9">At some fantastic dream without a name</l>
     <l n="10">That like the moon shining through prison bars ,</l>
     <l n="11">Visits the mind with madness . So they fly ,</l>
     <l n="12">Those soaring tangents , till the first jet tires ,</l>
     <l n="13">Failing , faltering half-way up the sky ,</l>
     <l n="14">And breaks — poor slender fountain that aspires</l>
     <l n="15">Against the whole strength of the heavy earth</l>
     <l n="16">Within whose womb , darkly , it took birth .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="17">Oh , how remote he walked along the street ,</l>
     <l n="18">Jostling with other lumps of human meat !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="19">He was so tired . The café doors invite .</l>
     <l n="20">Caverned within them , still lingers the night</l>
     <l n="21">In shadowy coolness , soothing the seared sight .</l>
     <l n="22">He sat there smoking , soulless and wholly crass ,</l>
     <l n="23">Sunk to the eyes in the warm sodden morass</l>
     <l n="24">Of his own guts , wearily , wearily</l>
     <l n="25">Ruminating visions of mortality —</l>
     <l n="26">Memento Moris from the pink alcove ,</l>
     <l n="27">Nightmare oppressiveness of profane love .</l>
     <l n="28">Cesspool within , and without him he could see</l>
     <l n="29">Nothing but mounds of flesh and harlotry .</l>
     <l n="30">Like a half-pricked bubble pendulous in space ,</l>
     <l n="31">The buttered leatheriness of a Jew ’ s face</l>
     <l n="32">Looms through cigar-smoke ; red and ghastly white ,</l>
     <l n="33">Death ’ s-head women fascinate the sight .</l>
     <l n="34">It was the nightmare of a corpse . Dead , dead . . .</l>
     <l n="35">Oh , to wake up , to live again ! he fled</l>
     <l n="36">From that foul place and from himself .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>VII TWIN domes of the Alhambra , Veiled tenderness of the sky above the Square : He sat him down in the gardens , under the trees , And in the dust , with the point of his umbrella , Drew pictures of the crosses we have to bear .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">The poor may starve , the sick have horrible pains —</l>

     <l n="3">Men may make war and money , mischief and love —</l>
     <l n="4">But about us are colours and the sky above .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="5">Yes , here , where the golden domes ring clear ,</l>
     <l n="6">And the planes patiently , hopefully renew</l>
     <l n="7">Their green refrain from year to year</l>
     <l n="8">To the dim spring burden of London ’ s husky blue ,</l>
     <l n="9">Here he could see the folly of it . How ?</l>
     <l n="10">Confine a boundless possible within</l>
     <l n="11">The prison of an ineluctable Now ?</l>
     <l n="12">Go slave to pain , woo forth original sin</l>
     <l n="13">Out of her lair — and all by a foolish Act ?</l>
     <l n="14">Madness ! But now , Wordsworth of Leicester Square ,</l>
     <l n="15">He ’ d learnt his lesson , learnt by the mere fact</l>
     <l n="16">Of the place existing , so finely unaware</l>
     <l n="17">Of syphilis and the restless in and out</l>
     <l n="18">Of public lavatories , and evening shout</l>
     <l n="19">Of winners and disasters , races and war .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="20">Troubles come thick enough . Why call for more</l>
     <l n="21">By suiting action to the divine Word ?</l>
     <l n="22">His spleen was chronic , true ; but he preferred</l>
     <l n="23">Its subtle agony to the brute force</l>
     <l n="24">That tugged the barbs of deep-anchored remorse .</l>
     <l n="25">The sunlight wrapped folds of soft golden silk</l>
     <l n="26">About him , and the air was warm as milk</l>
     <l n="27">Against his skin . Long sitting still had made</l>
     <l n="28">Cramped soreness such a pleasure , he was afraid</l>
     <l n="29">To shift his tortured limbs , lest he should mar</l>
     <l n="30">Life ’ s evenness . London ’ s noise from afar</l>
     <l n="31">Smoothed out its harshness to soothe his thoughts asleep ,</l>
     <l n="32">Sound that made silence much more calm and deep .</l>
     <l n="33">The domes of gold , the leaves , emerald bright ,</l>
     <l n="34">Were intense , piercing arrows of delight .</l>
     <l n="35">He did not think ; thought was a shallow thing</l>
     <l n="36">To his deep sense of life , of mere being .</l>
     <l n="37">He looked at his hand , lying there on his knee ,</l>
     <l n="38">The blue veins branching , the tendons cunningly</l>
     <l n="39">Dancing like jacks in a piano if he shook</l>
     <l n="40">A knot-boned finger . Only to look and look ,</l>
     <l n="41">Till he knew it , each hair and every pore —</l>
     <l n="42">It seemed enough : what need of anything more ?</l>
     <l n="43">Thought , a blind alley ; action , which at best</l>
     <l n="44">Is cudgelling water that goes back to rest</l>
     <l n="45">As soon as you give over your violences .</l>
     <l n="46">No , wisdom culls the flowers of the five senses ,</l>
     <l n="47">Savouring the secret sweetness they afford :</l>

     <l n="50">Well , let all pass .</l>

     <l n="67">Taking strange Procrustean steps ,</l>
     <l n="68">Lengthened , shortened to avoid</l>

     <l n="10">Turns ere you know it to faint minor thirds</l>
     <l n="11">Before the ritualistic pomps of the world —</l>
     <l n="12">The glass-grey silver of rivers , silken skies unfurled ,</l>
     <l n="13">Urim and Thummim of dawn and sun-setting ,</l>

   <p>IX TALL straight poplars stand in a meadow ; The wind and sun caress them , dappling The deep green grass with shine and shadow ; And a little apart one slender sapling Sways in the wind and almost seems Conscious of its own supple grace , And shakes its twin-hued leaves and gleams With silvery laughter , filling the place Where it stands with a sudden flash of human Beauty and grace ; till from her tree Steps forth the dryad , now turned woman , And sways to meet him . It is she .</p>

     <l n="2">Olives as firm and sleek and green</l>
     <l n="3">As the breasts of a sea god ’ s daughter ,</l>
     <l n="4">Swimming far down where the corpses sink</l>
     <l n="5">Through the dense shadowy water .</l>
     <l n="6">Silver and black on flank and back ,</l>
     <l n="7">The glossy sardine mourns its head .</l>
     <l n="8">The red anchovy and the beetroot red ,</l>
     <l n="9">With carrots , build a gorgeous stair —</l>
     <l n="10">Bronze , apoplexy and Venetian hair —</l>
     <l n="11">And the green pallor of the salad round</l>
     <l n="12">Sharpens their clarion sound .</l>
     <l n="13">De lady take hors d ’ œuvres ? and de gentleman too ?</l>
     <l n="14">Per due ! Due ! Echo answers : Du ’ . . .</l>
     <l n="15">“ So , Jenny , you ’ ve found another Perfect Man .”</l>
     <l n="16">“ Perfect , perhaps ; but not so sweet as you ,</l>
     <l n="17">Not such a baby .” “ Me ? A baby . Why ,</l>
     <l n="18">I am older than the rocks on which I sit . . . .”</l>
     <l n="19">Oh , how delightful , talking about oneself !</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="20">Golden wine , pale as a Tuscan primitive ,</l>
     <l n="21">And wine ’ s strange taste , half loathsome , half delicious :</l>
     <l n="22">Come , my Lesbia , let us love and live .</l>
     <l n="23">What though the mind still think that one thing ’ s vicious</l>
     <l n="24">More than another ? If the thought can give</l>
     <l n="25">This wine ’ s rich savour to our laughing kiss ,</l>
     <l n="26">Let us preserve the Christian prejudice .</l>
     <l n="27">Oh , there are shynesses and silences ,</l>
     <l n="28">Shynesses and silences !</l>
     <l n="29">But luckily God also gave us wine .</l>

     <l n="30">“ Jenny , adorable —” ( what draws the line</l>
     <l n="31">At the mere word “ love ”? ) “ has anyone the right</l>
     <l n="32">To look so lovely as you look to-night ,</l>
     <l n="33">To have such eyes , such a helmet of bright hair ?”</l>
     <l n="34">But candidly , he wondered , do I care ?</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="35">He heard her voice and himself spoke ,</l>
     <l n="36">But like faint light through a cloud of smoke ,</l>
     <l n="37">There came , unreal and far away ,</l>
     <l n="38">Mere sounds utterly empty — like the drone</l>
     <l n="39">Of prayers , crambe repetita , prayers and praise ,</l>
     <l n="40">Long , long ago , in the old School Chapel days ;</l>
     <l n="41">Senseless , but so intrusive on one ’ s own</l>
     <l n="42">Interior life one couldn ’ t even think . . .</l>

     <l n="43">O sweet , rare , perilous , retchy drink !</l>
     <l n="44">Another glass . . .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>X HOW cool is the moonless summer night , how sweet After the noise and the dizzy choking heat ! The bloodless lamps look down upon their own Green image in the polished roadway thrown , And onward and out of sight the great road runs , Smooth and dark as a river of calm bronze .</p>

     <l n="1">Freedom and widening space : his life expands ,</l>
     <l n="2">Ready , it seems , to burst the iron bands</l>
     <l n="3">Of self , to fuse with other lives and be</l>
     <l n="4">Not one but the world , no longer “ I ” but “ She .”</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">See , like the dolorous memory</l>
     <l n="6">Of happy times in misery ,</l>
     <l n="7">An aged hansom fills the street</l>
     <l n="8">With the superannuated beat</l>
     <l n="9">Of hollow hoofs and bells that chime</l>
     <l n="10">Out of another quieter time .</l>

     <l n="11">“ Good-night ,” the last kiss , “ and God bless you , my dear .”</l>
     <l n="12">So , she was gone , she who had been so near ,</l>
     <l n="13">So breathing-warm — soft mouth and hands and hair —</l>
     <l n="14">A moment since . Had she been really there ,</l>
     <l n="15">Close at his side , and had he kissed her ? It seemed</l>
     <l n="16">Unlikely as something somebody else had dreamed</l>
     <l n="17">And talked about at breakfast , being a bore :</l>
     <l n="18">Improbable , unsubstantial , dim , yet more</l>
     <l n="19">Real than the rest of life ; real as the blaze</l>
     <l n="20">Of a sudden-seen picture , as the lightning phrase</l>
     <l n="21">With which the poet-gods strangely create</l>
     <l n="22">Their brief bright world beyond the reach of fate .</l>
     <l n="23">Yet he could wonder now if he had kissed</l>
     <l n="24">Her or his own loved thoughts . Did she exist</l>
     <l n="25">Now she was history and safely stowed</l>
     <l n="26">Down in the past ? There ( with a conscious smile ) ,</l>
     <l n="27">There let her rest eternal . And meanwhile ,</l>
     <l n="28">Lamp-fringed towards meeting parallels , the road</l>
     <l n="29">Stretched out and out , and the old weary horse ,</l>
     <l n="30">Come from the past , went jogging his homeward course</l>
     <l n="31">Uphill through time to some demoded place ,</l>
     <l n="32">On ghostly hoofs back to the safe Has-Been :—</l>
     <l n="33">But fact returns insistent as remorse ;</l>
     <l n="34">Uphill towards Hampstead , back to the year of grace</l>
     <l n="35">Nineteen hundred and seventeen .</l>
