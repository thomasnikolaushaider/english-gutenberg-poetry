    <head>PREFACE</head>
    <p n="1">In a continent but recently settled , many parts of which have as yet little historical or cultural background , the material for this volume has been gathered from a section that was one of the first to be colonized . Here the Frenchman , Spaniard , and Englishman all passed , leaving each his legend ; and a brilliant and more or less feudal civilization with its aristocracy and slaves has departed with the economic system upon which it rested .</p>
    <p n="2">From this medley of early colonial discovery and romance , from the memories of war and reconstruction , it has been as difficult to choose coherently as to maintain restraint in selection among the many grotesque negro legends and superstitions so rich in imagery and music . Coupled with this there has been another task ; that of keeping these legends and stories in their natural matrix , the semi-tropical landscape of the Low Country , which somehow lends them all a pensively melancholy yet fitting background . Not to have so portrayed them , would have been to sacrifice their essentially local tang . To the reader unfamiliar with coastal Carolina , the unique aspects of its landscapes may seem exaggerated in these pages ; the observant visitor and the native will , it is hoped , recognize that neither the colors nor the shadows are too strong . These poems , however , are not local only , they are stories and pictures of a chapter of American history little known , but dramatic and colorful , and in the relation of an important part to the whole they may carry a decided interest to the country at large .</p>
    <p n="3">Local color has a fatal tendency to remain local ; but it is also true that the universal often borders on the void . It has been said , perhaps wisely , that the immediate future of American Poetry lies rather in the intimate feeling of local poets who can interpret their own sections to the rest of the country as Robinson and Frost have done so nobly for New England , rather than in the effort to yawp universally . Hence there is no attempt here to say , “ O New York , O Pennsylvania , ” but simply , “ O Carolina . ”</p>
    <p n="4">The South , however , has been “ interpreted ” so often , either with condescending pity or nauseous sentimentality , that it is the aim of this book to speak simply and carefully amid a babel of unauthentic utterance . Nevertheless , the contents of this volume do not pretend to exact historical accuracy ; this is poetry rather than history , although the legends and facts upon which it rests have been gathered with much painstaking research and careful verification . It should be kept in mind that these poems are impressionistic attempts to present the fleeting feeling of the moment , landscape moods , and the ephemeral attitudes of the past . Legends are material to be moulded , and not facts to be recorded . Above all here is no pretence of propaganda .</p>
    <p n="5">As some of the material touched on is not accessible in standard reference , prose notes have been included giving the historical facts or background of legend upon which a poem has been based . These notes together with a bibliography will be found at the back of the volume .</p>
    <p n="6">If the only result of this book is to call attention to the literary and artistic values inherent in the South , and to the essentially unique and yet nationally interesting qualities of the Carolina Low Country , its landscapes and legends , the labor bestowed here will have secured its harvest .</p>

      <head>SILENCES<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span></head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">You who have known my city for a day</l>
       <l n="2">And heard the music of her steepled bells ,</l>
       <l n="3">Then laughed , and passed along your vagrant way ,</l>
       <l n="4">Carrying only what the city tells</l>
       <l n="5">To those who listen solely with their ears ;</l>
       <l n="6">You know St. Matthew 's swinging harmonies ,</l>
       <l n="7">And old St. Michael 's tale of golden years</l>
       <l n="8">Far less like bells than chanted memories .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="9">Yet there is something wanting in the song</l>
       <l n="10">Of lyric youth with voice unschooled by pain .</l>
       <l n="11">And there are breathing stillnesses that throng</l>
       <l n="12">Dim corners , and that only stir again</l>
       <l n="13">When bells are dumb . Not even bronze that beats</l>
       <l n="14">Our heart-throbs back can tell of old defeats .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="15">But you who take the city for your own ,</l>
       <l n="16">Come with me when the night flows deep and kind</l>
       <l n="17">Along these narrow ways of troubled stone ,</l>
       <l n="18">And floods the wide savannas of the mind</l>
       <l n="19">With tides that cool the fever of the day :</l>
       <l n="20">One with the dark , companioned by the stars ,</l>
       <l n="21">We 'll seek St. Philip 's , nebulous and gray ,</l>
       <l n="22">Holding its throbbing beacon to the bars ,</l>
       <l n="23">A prisoned spirit vibrant in the stone</l>
       <l n="24">That knew its empire of forgotten things .</l>
       <l n="25">Then will the city know you for her own ,</l>
       <l n="26">And feel you meet to share her sufferings ;</l>
       <l n="27">While down a swirl of poignant memories ,</l>
       <l n="28">Herself shall find you in her silences .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="29">Once coaches waited row on shining row</l>
       <l n="30">Before this door ; and where the thirsty street</l>
       <l n="31">Drank the deep shadow of the portico</l>
       <l n="32">The Sunday hush was stirred by happy feet ,</l>
       <l n="33">Low greetings , and the rustle of brocade ,</l>
       <l n="34">The organ throb , and warmth of sunny eyes</l>
       <l n="35">That flashed and smiled beneath a bonnet shade ;</l>
       <l n="36">Life with the lure of all its swift disguise .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="37">Then from the soaring lyric of the spire ,</l>
       <l n="38">Like the composite voice of all the town ,</l>
       <l n="39">The bells burst swiftly into singing fire</l>
       <l n="40">That wrapped the building , and which showered down</l>
       <l n="41">Bright cadences to flash along the ways</l>
       <l n="42">Loud with the splendid gladness of the days .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="43">War took the city , and the laughter died</l>
       <l n="44">From lips that pain had kissed . One after one</l>
       <l n="45">All lovely things went down the sanguine tide ,</l>
       <l n="46">While death made moaning answer to the gun .</l>
       <l n="47">Then , as a golden voice dies in the throat</l>
       <l n="48">Of one who lives , but whose glad heart is dead ,</l>
       <l n="49">The bells were taken ; and a sterner note</l>
       <l n="50">Rang from their bronze where Lee and Jackson led .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="51">The rhythmic seasons chill and burn and chill ,</l>
       <l n="52">Cooling old angers , warming hearts again .</l>
       <l n="53">The ancient building quickens to the thrill</l>
       <l n="54">Of lilting feet ; but only singing rain</l>
       <l n="55">Flutters old echoes in the portico ;</l>
       <l n="56">Those who can still remember love it so .</l>

      <head>PRESENCES</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">Despise the garish presences that flaunt</l>
       <l n="2">The obvious possession of today ,</l>
       <l n="3">To wear with me the spectacles that haunt</l>
       <l n="4">The optic sense with wraiths of yesterday —</l>
       <l n="5">These cobbled shores through which the traffic streams</l>
       <l n="6">Have been the stage-set of successive towns ,</l>
       <l n="7">Where coffined actors postured out their dreams ,</l>
       <l n="8">And harlot Folly changed her thousand gowns .</l>
       <l n="9">This corner-shop was Bull 's Head Tavern ,</l>
       <l n="10">When names now dead on marble lived in clay ;</l>
       <l n="11">Its rooms were like a sanded cavern ,</l>
       <l n="12">Where candles made a sallow jest of day ,</l>
       <l n="13">And drovers ’ boots came grinding like a quern ,</l>
       <l n="14">While merchants drank their steaming cups of “ tay . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="15">Here pock-marked Black Beard covenanted Bonnet</l>
       <l n="16">To slit the Dons ’ throats at St. Augustine ,</l>
       <l n="17">And bussed light ladies , unknown to this sonnet ,</l>
       <l n="18">Whose names , no doubt , would rime with Magdalene .</l>
       <l n="19">And English parsons , who had lost their fames ,</l>
       <l n="20">Sat tippling wine as spicy as their joke ,</l>
       <l n="21">Larding bald texts with bets on cocking mains ,</l>
       <l n="22">And whiffing pipes churchwardens used to smoke .</l>
       <l n="23">Here macaronis , hands a-droop with laces ,</l>
       <l n="24">Dealt knave to knave in picquet or écarté ,</l>
       <l n="25">In coats no whit less scarlet than their faces ,</l>
       <l n="26">While bullies hiccuped healths to King and Party ,</l>
       <l n="27">And Yankee slavers , in from Barbadoes ,</l>
       <l n="28">Drove flinty bargains with keen Huguenots .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="29">Then Meeting Street first knew St. Michael 's steeple ,</l>
       <l n="30">When redcoats marched with royal drums a-banging ,</l>
       <l n="31">Or merchants stopped gowned tutors to inquire</l>
       <l n="32">Why school let out to see a pirate hanging ;</l>
       <l n="33">And gentlemen took supper in the street ,</l>
       <l n="34">When candle-shine from tables guled the dark ,</l>
       <l n="35">While others passing by would be discreet</l>
       <l n="36">And take the farther side without remark ,</l>
       <l n="37">Pausing perhaps to snuff the balmy savor</l>
       <l n="38">Of turtle-soup mulled with the bay-leaves ’ flavor :</l>
       <l n="39">These walls beheld them , and these lingering trees</l>
       <l n="40">That still preempt the middle of the gutter ;</l>
       <l n="41">They are the backdrops for old comedies —</l>
       <l n="42">If leaves were tongues — what stories they might utter !</l>

       <l n="154">The old man crumpled like a sack ;</l>
       <l n="155">I felt his stringy arms go slack .</l>

       <l n="177">As if the devil pulled the string .</l>
       <l n="178">The light ran melting round the ring ;</l>

       <l n="1">Sea-island winds sweep through Palmetto Town ,</l>
       <l n="2">Bringing with piney tang the old romance</l>
       <l n="3">Of Pirates and of smuggling gentlemen ;</l>
       <l n="4">And tongues as languorous as southern France</l>
       <l n="5">Flow down her streets like water-talk at fords ;</l>
       <l n="6">While through iron gates where pickaninnies sprawl ,</l>
       <l n="7">The sound floats back , in rippled banjo chords ,</l>
       <l n="8">From lush magnolia shade where mockers call .</l>
       <l n="9">Mornings , the flower-women hawk their wares —</l>
       <l n="10">Bronze caryatids of a genial race ,</l>
       <l n="11">Bearing the bloom-heaped baskets on their heads ;</l>
       <l n="12">Lithe , with their arms akimbo in wide grace ,</l>
       <l n="13">Their jasmine nods jestingly at cares —</l>
       <l n="14">Turbaned they are , deep-chested , straight and tall ,</l>
       <l n="15">Bandying old English words now seldom heard ,</l>
       <l n="16">But sweet as Provençal .</l>
       <l n="17">Dreams peer like prisoners through her harp-like gates ,</l>
       <l n="18">From molten gardens mottled with gray-gloom ,</l>
       <l n="19">Where lichened sundials shadow ancient dates ,</l>
       <l n="20">And deep piazzas loom .</l>
       <l n="21">Fringing her quays are frayed palmetto posts ,</l>
       <l n="22">Where clipper ships once moored along the ways ,</l>
       <l n="23">And fanlight doorways , sunstruck with old ghosts ,</l>
       <l n="24">Sicken with loves of her lost yesterdays .</l>
       <l n="25">Often I halt upon some gabled walk ,</l>
       <l n="26">Thinking I see the ear-ringed picaroons ,</l>
       <l n="27">Slashed with a sash or Spanish folderols ,</l>
       <l n="28">Gambling for moidores or for gold doubloons .</l>
       <l n="29">But they have gone where night goes after day ,</l>
       <l n="30">And the old streets are gay with whistled tunes ,</l>
       <l n="31">Bright with the lilt of scarlet parasols ,</l>
       <l n="32">Carried by honey-voiced young octoroons .</l>

       <l n="1">There is deliberateness in all sea-island ways ,</l>
       <l n="2">As alien to our days as stone wheels are .</l>
       <l n="3">The Islands cannot see the use of life</l>
       <l n="4">Which only lives for change .</l>
       <l n="5">There days are flat ,</l>
       <l n="6">And all things must move slowly ;</l>
       <l n="7">Even the seasons are conservative —</l>
       <l n="8">No sudden flaunting of wild colors in the fall ,</l>
       <l n="9">Only a gradual fading of the green ,</l>
       <l n="10">As if the earth turned slowly ,</l>
       <l n="11">Or looked with one still face upon the sun</l>
       <l n="12">As Venus does —</l>
       <l n="13">Until the trees , the fields , the marshes ,</l>
       <l n="14">All turn dun , dull Quaker-brown ,</l>
       <l n="15">And a mild winter settles down ,</l>
       <l n="16">And mosses are more gray .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="17">All human souls are glasses which reflect</l>
       <l n="18">The aspects of the outer world ;</l>
       <l n="19">See what terrible gods the huge Himalayas bred !</l>
       <l n="20">And the fierce Jewish Jaywah came</l>
       <l n="21">From the hot Syrian deserts</l>
       <l n="22">With his inhibitory decalogue .</l>
       <l n="23">The gods of little hills are always tame ;</l>

       <l n="25">No change on these sea-islands !</l>
       <l n="26">The huge piled clouds range</l>
       <l n="27">White in the cobalt sky ;</l>
       <l n="28">The moss hangs ,</l>
       <l n="29">And the strong , tiring sea-winds blow —</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="31">The horses plow with hanging heads ,</l>

       <l n="33">Indifferent to the sun ;</l>
       <l n="34">The old cotton bushes hang with whitened heads ;</l>
       <l n="35">And there among the live-oak trees ,</l>
       <l n="36">Peep the small whitewashed cabins ,</l>
       <l n="37">Painted blue , perhaps , and scarlet-turbaned women ,</l>
       <l n="38">Ample-hipped , with voices soft and warm</l>

       <l n="40">Day after day the ocean pumps</l>

       <l n="43">The tides flow in long , gray , weed-streaked lines ;</l>
       <l n="44">The salt water , like the planet 's lifeblood , goes</l>
       <l n="45">As if the earth were breathing with long-taken breaths</l>
       <l n="46">And we were very near her heart .</l>

       <l n="47">No wonder that these faces show a tired dismay ,</l>

       <l n="49">Spring 's coming is too fierce with life ;</l>
       <l n="50">And summer is too long ;</l>
       <l n="51">The stunted pine trees struggle with the sand</l>
       <l n="52">Till the eyes sicken with their dwarfing strife .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="53">There are old women here among these island homes ,</l>
       <l n="54">With dull brown eyes that look at something gray ,</l>
       <l n="55">And tight silver hair , drawn back in lines ,</l>
       <l n="56">Like the beach grass that 's always blown one way ;</l>
       <l n="57">With such a melancholy in their faces</l>
       <l n="58">I know that they have lived long in these places .</l>
       <l n="59">The tides , the hooting owls , the daylight moons ,</l>
       <l n="60">The leprous lights and shadows of the mosses ,</l>
       <l n="61">The funereal woodlands of these coasts ,</l>
       <l n="62">Draped like a perpetual hearse ,</l>
       <l n="63">And memories of an old war 's ancient losses ,</l>
       <l n="64">Dwell in their faces ’ shadows like gray ghosts .</l>
       <l n="65">And worse —</l>
       <l n="66">The terror of the black man always near —</l>
       <l n="67">The drab level of the ricefields and the marsh</l>
       <l n="68">Lends them a mask of fear .</l>

     <head>MAGNOLIA GARDENS</head>
     <head>A PROSE-POEM</head>
     <p>In the spring when the first midges dance and warm days lure the last-year 's butterfly , the scarlet of the cardinals begins to flicker through the ivory smoke of the mosses . Then the alligator leaves his winter ooze , and the widening “ O ” of the ripple which his gar-like nose makes , travels slowly across the sullen ponds , where the pendant gonfalons of the mosses kiss their imaginary duplicates , hanging head downward in the red water .</p>
     <p>When the first frog honks with the bull-voiced trumpet of resurgent spring , the jasmine rings its little hawk-bells , golden harp notes through the forest ; and the usurping wistaria assumes the purple , reigning imperial and alone , flaunting its palidementum in a cascade of lilac amid the matrix of the mosses . Its sleek , muscular vine-arms writhe round the clasped bodies of live oaks as if two lovers slept beneath a cloak , and the cloisonné pavilion of their dalliance drips a blue-glaze of shadows overhead .</p>
     <p>Underneath this motley canopy of gray and blue , lush with the early tenderness of leaves , the pink azaleas open light-shy eyes like pupils of albinos , sloughing off delicate pods that smoulder , when the wind blows , live coals among the gray of furnace ashes . Here are magenta carpets fit for leprechauns , when crescent moons glimmer upon the ocher ponds , and the slow fireflies light their phantom lanterns , weaving to and fro about the ivory-orange marble of the tomb .</p>
     <p>Each April day brings opalescent waves of birds that dart like living brands about the aisles to light the flower lamps ; nonpareils , orioles , and hummingbirds , a mist of speed upon their wings , while the blue heron stands one-leggéd by the ponds , watching the garden till it seethes and flames with colors from the cloaks of mandarins .</p>
     <p>High in the ancient forest the magnolias burn the perfect alban lucence of their lamps ; white are their ivory cups like priestly linen , and fragrant with the tang of foreign citrons . An esoteric , mirrored swan slides by like Cleopatra 's barge , while drums of color beaten by a maniac blend with old tints of Leonardo 's dreams , colors that God might see if his own lightning blasted out his eyes .</p>
     <p>This march of color chants a strange barbaric fitness of dithyrambic chords , and moves processional across the days like some encarnadined durbar , where a huge Ethiopian eunuch in red moon-shaped slippers and an orange turban walks with a glittering scimetar , leading a brace of sleepy leopards drugged and golden eyed ; the caparisoned elephants swing down a latticed street ; silk shawls hang from balconies , brushing the domed gilt of howdahs ; and ruby-roped , the maharajahs sway behind the mahout with his peavey-goad .</p>
     <p>The stark denial of the blue-ribbed sky looks down upon this garden , where the wantonness of earth is flaunted in the spring against the face of heaven 's void sterility . Here stolid faces look ashamed . When the sun leans on boreal wings , there is a month that lovers walk here justified , while flower throats cry in vast choirs , “ Glory to life ! ” and the uplifted trumpets of vine tubas shout with noise of color set to notes of bloom .</p>

       <l n="11">But their sires were with El Tarab ,</l>
       <l n="12">When he conquered Andalusia</l>
       <l n="13">For the Prophet and the Arab ;</l>
       <l n="14">And they came with Ponce de Leon ,</l>
       <l n="15">When the Spaniard made a peon</l>
       <l n="16">And a Christian of the Carib .</l>
       <l n="17">Peering from palmetto thickets</l>
       <l n="18">At some fort 's coquina wickets ,</l>
       <l n="19">Startled Indians saw them grazing ,</l>
       <l n="20">Thunder-stamping and amazing</l>
       <l n="21">As the beasts from other stars ,</l>
       <l n="22">When they galloped down savannas ,</l>
       <l n="23">And their masters seemed centaurs</l>
       <l n="24">With the new white metal blazing .</l>
       <l n="25">Thus they came , these little beasts ,</l>
       <l n="26">With the men-at-arms and priests ,</l>
       <l n="27">In the west with Coronado</l>
       <l n="28">When he reached the Colorado ,</l>
       <l n="29">In the east with bold De Soto</l>
       <l n="30">In the search for El Dorado ,</l>
       <l n="31">And they packed the bells and toys</l>
       <l n="32">That the chieftains loved like boys ;</l>
       <l n="33">Struggling through the swamps and briars</l>
       <l n="34">After dons and tonsured friars ;</l>
       <l n="35">Dying in the forests dismal ,</l>
       <l n="36">Till the shrill of silver clarion</l>
       <l n="37">Brought the buzzards to the carrion</l>
       <l n="38">Round the smoke of lonely fires</l>
       <l n="39">In a continent abysmal .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="40">So De Soto left them dying ,</l>
       <l n="41">Heedless of their human crying ;</l>
       <l n="42">Here he turned them loose to die</l>
       <l n="43">Underneath a foreign sky ;</l>
       <l n="44">But they lived on thicket dross ,</l>
       <l n="45">On the leaves and Spanish moss —</l>

    <head>NOTES</head>
    <p n="1">NOTE ON THE CHIMES</p>
    <p n="2">TO ACCOMPANY “ SILENCES ”</p>
    <p n="3">The bells of Charleston , like the bells of London Town , have a peculiar interest . St. Michael 's bells and clock were brought from England in 1764 . When the British evacuated Charleston in 1782 they took the bells with them . A Mr. Ryhineu bought them in England and returned them . They were rehung in November , 1783 . During the Civil War , St. Michael 's steeple was the target for Federal artillery and fleet guns . In 1861 the bells were taken to Columbia , S. C ., where two of them were stolen , and the rest injured by fire when the city was burned . Those left were again sent to England , and recast in the original moulds . In March , 1867 , they once again rang out from the spire .</p>
    <p n="4">St. Phillip 's Church stands in the old part of the town . During the Civil War its bells were cast into cannon . For a long time its steeple was used as a lighthouse . It is the center of forgotten things .</p>
    <p n="5">The bells of St. Matthew 's are modern and speak of a new order , but all the bells are the voice of the town . They speak for her silences , which are eloquent .</p>
    <p n="6">NOTE ON “ THE PIRATES ”</p>
    <p n="7">The many inlets and sheltering coves of the Carolina coasts very early made the “ low country ” seaboard a rendezvous for pirates and a shelter to refit , and to bury their treasure .</p>
    <p n="8">As early as 1565 the French from Ribault 's settlement succumbed to the temptation to plunder their rich Spanish neighbors ; and in the century before the coming of the English , the lonely bays and estuaries saw strange ships from time to time . There was a pirate settlement by 1664 at Cape Fear River , where Governor Sayle did not arrive until 1670 to take formal possession for the Lords Proprietors of the colony .</p>
    <p n="9">The Peace of Utrecht turned many privateers into pirates , ships which had been habitually preying upon Spanish commerce since Blake 's victory at Santa Cruz in 1657 , and these gentlemen of fortune were at first welcome in the Carolinas . Nearly all the coin in circulation then was at first brought by such doubtful adventurers , and they were regarded as the natural protectors of the Carolinas against their powerful enemy , the Spaniard , to the south .</p>
    <p n="10">Gradually , however , this cordial attitude changed . It was a small step from attacking Spanish to plundering English commerce , and with the cultivation and export of rice and indigo , the demand for a safe sea passage grew overwhelming , while the coasts continued to be ravaged . The royal government was slow to act . In 1684 we learn that “ the governor will not in all probability always reside in Charles Town , which is so near the sea as to be in danger of sudden attack by pirates ; ” nor was this an idle thought , for the town was blockaded by pirate ships at the harbor 's mouth , and medicines and supplies demanded while citizens were held as hostages .</p>
    <p n="11">In 1718 Governor Spotswood of Virginia sent an expedition to North Carolina , which succeeded in surprising , capturing , and beheading the notorious “ Black Beard , ” who in company with one Stede Bonnet , had long ravaged the coast with impunity .</p>
    <p n="12">In August of the same year word was brought to Charlestown that Bonnet with his ship the Royal James was refitting in the Cape Fear River . Colonel William Rhett volunteered to attack him . With two sloops of eight guns each , the Henry and the Nymph , and about 130 men in all , he set sail , and found Bonnet at anchor in the Cape Fear River . In making the attack , and during the encounter , all three ships ran aground . The fight raged desperately all day between the Henry and the Royal James , the Nymph being unable to get off the shoal and come to the help of her companion ship . Bonnet finally surrendered and was taken prisoner to Charlestown . It is this adventure which the poem celebrates .</p>
    <p n="13">Bonnet escaped , but was afterwards recaptured by Colonel Rhett on Sullivan 's Island . He and about thirty of his crew were hanged about the corner of Meeting and Water Streets . Bonnet , himself , was hanged later than his crew , after a masterpiece of invective by the judge , who painted hell vividly . This pirate leader was dragged fainting to the gallows , and there was much sympathy for him , as it was said , “ His humor of going a-pirating proceeded from a disorder of the mind ... occasioned by some discomforts he found in the married state . ”</p>
    <p n="14">NOTE ON “ THE SEEWEES OF SEEWEE BAY ”</p>
    <p n="15">The Seewee Indians , who lived on the shores of what is now known as Bull 's Bay , S. C ., but was formerly called Seewee Bay , became discontented with the small prices obtained from the white traders for pelts . Seeing the ships constantly coming into the Bay from England , they conceived the idea of building large canoes and reaching England over the ocean . Several huge canoes , larger than any heretofore built by Indians , were accordingly constructed ; these were loaded with the proceeds of a season 's hunting , and , manned by all the braves of the tribe , set out in the direction from which the ships came . A gale came up and the braves were never seen again . Their squaws gradually wandered off to other tribes . This event took place about 1696 .</p>
    <p n="16">NOTE ON LA FAYETTE</p>
    <p n="17">TO ACCOMPANY “ LA FAYETTE LANDS ”</p>
    <p n="18">The Marquis de la Fayette , under the name of Gilbert du Motier , sailed from Bordeaux on the 26th of March , 1777 , accompanied by the Baron Kalb and several French Army Officers . On the 14th of June , 1777 , he first landed in America on North Island in Winyah Bay , near Georgetown , S. C ., and was received at the house of Major Huger . In a letter to his wife , written soon after his landing , La Fayette says , “ I first saw and judged of the life of the country at the house of a Major Huger . ” Detailed accounts of La Fayette 's landing and reception still exist .</p>
    <p n="19">NOTE ON THEODOSIA BURR</p>
    <p n="20">TO ACCOMPANY “ THE PRIEST AND THE PIRATE ”</p>
    <p n="21">In 1801 Theodosia , daughter of Aaron Burr , Vice-President of the United States , married Joseph Alston of “ The Oaks , ” Hobcaw Barony , S. C . They had one son , Aaron Burr Alston , who died in 1812 , the same year that Joseph Alston was elected Governor of the State . On December 30th , 1812 , at the urgent solicitation of her father , who had just returned from Europe , and who awaited her eagerly in New York , Theodosia set sail from Georgetown , S. C ., in the pilot-boat schooner , “ Patriot . ” Those on board were never seen again .</p>
    <p n="22">The vessel , which was being fitted out as a privateer , was carrying dismounted guns under her deck , and may have foundered in the severe gale of January 1st , 1813 .</p>
    <p n="23">In 1869 , however , a Dr. W. C . Pool attended a fisher family at Naggs Head , Kittyhawk , N. C . In the fisherman 's hut hung an oil painting of a beautiful woman , which had been taken from an abandoned pilot-built schooner that drifted onto the North Carolina coast in that vicinity in January , 1813 . No one was aboard and the vessel had evidently been looted . Ladies ’ clothes were found in great disorder in the cabin .</p>
    <p n="24">There was also a story told by a dying sailor who confessed that he had seen the crew of such a boat walk the plank , and that among them was a beautiful woman who walked into the sea with a Bible or prayer-book in her hand .</p>
    <p n="25">The painting is in the possession of the Burr-Alston connection , and is thought by them , on account of its striking family resemblance , to be a picture of Theodosia Burr . The painting story has often been scouted , but there is too much circumstantial evidence to ignore it in treating the legend .</p>
    <p n="26">NOTE TO “ THE LAST CREW ”</p>
    <p n="27">The “ Fish-Boat ” of the Confederate Navy , which exhaustive research indicates to have been the first submarine vessel to sink an enemy ship in time of war , was designed by Horace L. Hundley in 1863 . This boat was twenty feet long , three and one-half feet wide , and five feet deep . Her motive power consisted of eight men whose duty it was to turn the crank of the propeller shaft by hand until the target had been reached . When this primitive craft was closed for diving there was only sufficient air to support life for half an hour . Since the torpedo was attached to the boat itself there was no chance of escape . The only hope was to reach and destroy the enemy vessel before the crew were suffocated or drowned .</p>
    <p n="28">Five successive volunteer crews died without reaching their objectives . But the sixth crew was successful in sinking the Federal blockading ship “ Housatonic , ” their own craft being caught and crushed beneath the foundering vessel . These crews went to certain death in the night time , in such secrecy that it was often months before their own families knew the names of the men . And now , with the lapse of scarcely more than half a century , it has been possible to find the names of only sixteen of those who paid the price .</p>
    <p n="29">Because no nation of any time can point to a more inspiring example of self-sacrifice , and because now , in a country reunited and indissoluble , the traditions of both the North and the South are a common , glorious heritage , the poem , which presents the final episode in the drama , is written as a memorial to all who gave their lives in the venture .</p>
    <p n="30">D. H .</p>
    <p n="31">NOTE ON POE</p>
    <p n="32">TO ACCOMPANY “ EDGAR ALLAN POE ” AND “ ALCHEMY ”</p>
    <p n="33">In May , 1828 , Poe enlisted in the army under the name of Edgar A. Perry , and was assigned to Battery “ H ” of the First Artillery at Fort Independence . In October his battery was ordered to Fort Moultrie , Charleston , S. C. Poe spent a whole year on Sullivan 's Island . Professor C. Alphonso Smith , the well-known Poe authority , says , “ So far as I know , this was the only tropical background that Poe had ever seen . ” That the susceptible nature of the young poet was vastly impressed by the weirdness and melancholy scenery of the Carolina coast country , there can be very little doubt . The dank tarns and funereal woodlands of his landscapes , or at least the strong suggestion of them , may all be found here , and the scene of The Goldbug is definitely laid on Sullivan 's Island . Here are dim family vaults , and tracts of country in which the House of Usher might well stand .</p>
    <p n="34">“ Dim vales and shadowy floods And cloudy-looking woods Whose forms we can n't discover , From the tears that drip all over ”</p>
    <p n="35">was written while Poe was in the army at Fort Moultrie , and appeared in his second volume in 1829 . There are later echoes .</p>
    <p n="36">“ Around by lifting winds forgot Resignedly beneath the sky The melancholy waters lie . ”</p>
    <p n="37">H. A .</p>
    <p n="38">“ MARSH TACKIES ”</p>
    <p n="39">“ Marsh Tackies ” is the name given by the negroes to the little , wild horses of the Carolina coast country 's swamps and sea islands . Early traditions say that these horses were found by the English when they first came and that they are the descendants of runaways from the Spanish settlements to the South about St. Augustine , or horses turned loose by DeSoto upon his ill-fated march to the Mississippi . These horses pick up a precarious living in out-of-the-way sections along the coast , and are occasionally taken and broken in by the negroes . They are the “ poor horse trash ” of the section .</p>
