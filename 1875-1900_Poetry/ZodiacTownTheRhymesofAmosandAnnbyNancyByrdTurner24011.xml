     <l n="1">They went to the January house 9</l>
     <l n="2">They went to the February place 19</l>
     <l n="3">The March house , strangely , was built in a tree 29</l>
     <l n="4">The April house was near a pond 39</l>
     <l n="5">And May herself , with a dimple and curl 49</l>
     <l n="6">The June house was n't a house at all 59</l>
     <l n="7">The July house was an old , old house ,</l>
     <l n="8">With an old , old man inside 71</l>
     <l n="9">Oh , such a funny August house —</l>
     <l n="10">It really was like a zoo 81</l>
     <l n="11">Very familiar September seemed 93</l>
     <l n="12">It was a queer October place 103</l>
     <l n="13">The next house stood just back from the street 113</l>
     <l n="14">The house of December was all aglow 121</l>

    <p>ZODIAC TOWN</p>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="15">Amos and Ann had a poem to learn ,</l>
     <l n="16">A poem to learn one day ;</l>
     <l n="17">But alas ! they sighed , and alack ! they cried ,</l>
     <l n="18">‘ Twere better to go and play .</l>
     <l n="19">Ann was sure ‘ twas a waste of time</l>
     <l n="20">To bother a child with jingling rhyme .</l>
     <l n="21">Amos said , “ What 's the sense in rhythm —</l>
     <l n="22">Feet and lines ? ” He had finished with ‘ em !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="23">They peered at the poem with scowly faces ,</l>
     <l n="24">And yawned and stumbled and lost their places .</l>
     <l n="25">Then — a breeze romped by , and a bluebird sang ,</l>
     <l n="26">And they shut the book with a snap and a bang ;</l>
     <l n="27">Shut the book and were off and away ,</l>
     <l n="28">Away on flying feet ;—</l>
     <l n="29">Never did squirrels move more light ,</l>
     <l n="30">Or rabbits run more fleet !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="31">Over a wall and down a lane</l>
     <l n="32">And through a field they ran ;</l>
     <l n="33">And “ Where shall we go ? ” said Amos . “ Oh ,</l>
     <l n="34">And where shall we stop ? ” cried Ann .</l>
     <l n="35">Then all at once , round the curve of a hill ,</l>
     <l n="36">They pulled up panting and stood stock-still ;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="37">For there , by the edge of a ripplety brook ,</l>
     <l n="38">In a deep little , steep little place ,</l>
     <l n="39">Sat a long-legged youth , with a staff and a book</l>
     <l n="40">And a quaint , very quizzical face .</l>
     <l n="41">His cap and his trousers were dusty green</l>
     <l n="42">And his jacket was rusty brown ,</l>
     <l n="43">And he whittled away on sweet white wood ,</l>
     <l n="44">With shavings showering down .</l>
     <l n="45">He whittled away ‘ twixt a laugh and a tune ,</l>
     <l n="46">With fingers as light as thistles .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="47">“ And what are you making ? ” asked Amos and Ann .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="48">He said , “ I am making whistles . ”</l>
     <l n="49">He finished one with a notch and a slit ,</l>
     <l n="50">And threw back his head and blew on it .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="51">The whistle sang like a bird when he blew ,</l>
     <l n="52">Then he twinkled and put it down .</l>
     <l n="53">“ And where are you going , ” he said , “ you two ?</l>
     <l n="54">Are you going to Zodiac Town ? ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="55">Each of them shook a doubtful head</l>
     <l n="56">( For truly they did n't know ) .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="57">“ But make us a whistle like yours , ” they said ,</l>
     <l n="58">“ And anywhere we will go ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="59">“ I 'll make you a whistle apiece , ” quoth he ,</l>
     <l n="60">“ And if you like , you may follow me ;</l>
     <l n="61">Zodiac Town 's in the land of Time ,</l>
     <l n="62">And I go by the road of Rhyme . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="63">Ann looked at Amos and Amos at Ann ;</l>
     <l n="64">They blinked with sheer surprise ;</l>
     <l n="65">And then they looked at the long-legged man ,</l>
     <l n="66">Who twinkled back with his eyes .</l>
     <l n="67">They said ( and their voices were meek and low ) ,</l>
     <l n="68">“ We ran away from a rhyme , you know . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="69">“ You did ? ” cried the fellow in green and brown .</l>
     <l n="70">“ Then it 's unmistakably plain , oho ,</l>
     <l n="71">That you 're due in Zodiac Town ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="72">He took up his book and shouldered his staff ,</l>
     <l n="73">And turned to Amos and Ann .</l>
     <l n="74">“ Call me J. M ., ” he said with a laugh .</l>
     <l n="75">“ That stands for Journeying Man .</l>
     <l n="76">I 'll make you some whistles along the way ,</l>
     <l n="77">While you are remembering rhymes to say ;</l>
     <l n="78">For more than once in the land of Time</l>
     <l n="79">You will have to speak in rhyme . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="80">“ Our names , ” said the children , “ are Amos and Ann ;</l>
     <l n="81">And poetry is rather hard for us ,</l>
     <l n="82">But we 'll do the best we can . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="83">Then they went away with the young-faced man ,</l>
     <l n="84">Joyfully up and down ,</l>
     <l n="85">Talking in rhyme by hill and lea ,</l>
     <l n="86">Gayly in rhyme — for that , said he ,</l>
     <l n="87">Was the tongue of Zodiac Town .</l>
     <l n="88">To Zodiac after a while they came —</l>
     <l n="89">The twistiest , mistiest town ,</l>
     <l n="90">With odd little collopy , scallopy streets</l>
     <l n="91">Meandering up and down .</l>
     <l n="92">The home of the years and the hours was there ,</l>
     <l n="93">Of the minutes , the months , and the days —</l>
     <l n="94">Houses with windows that winked and smiled ,</l>
     <l n="95">And doors with sociable ways ;</l>
     <l n="96">And leaves and apples and chestnuts brown</l>
     <l n="97">Came pattering down , came clattering down ,</l>
     <l n="98">And stairways wound to the top of a hill</l>
     <l n="99">That a person could climb if he had the will —</l>
     <l n="100">That a person could climb , then start at the top ,</l>
     <l n="101">And bumpeting down and thumpeting down ,</l>
     <l n="102">Go zip ! to the bottom with never a stop .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="103">“ Whoopee ! ” cried Amos — and off and away ,</l>
     <l n="104">Quick with a kick , like a clown ,</l>
     <l n="105">He ran to the top of the highest stair ,</l>
     <l n="106">Ann at his heels — And zip ! the pair</l>
     <l n="107">Came bumpeting down and thumpeting down .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="108">Then , “ Come , you two , ” said the Journeying Man ,</l>
     <l n="109">“ We have twelve calls to pay .</l>
     <l n="110">We 'll visit the months this time , if we can .</l>
     <l n="111">Now listen to me : at every house</l>
     <l n="112">Many clocks will be ticking away :</l>
     <l n="113">Grandfather clocks and cuckoo clocks</l>
     <l n="114">And moon-faced clocks on shelves ,</l>
     <l n="115">Clocks with alarms and eight-day clocks ,</l>
     <l n="116">All talking low to themselves ;</l>
     <l n="117">Little gilt clocks and clocks with chimes ,</l>
     <l n="118">And all of them keeping different times .</l>
     <l n="119">And any minute of any hour</l>
     <l n="120">( You never did see their like ) ,</l>
     <l n="121">Evening or morning , with never a warning ,</l>
     <l n="122">One of the lot will strike .</l>
     <l n="123">And you may be talking your everyday talk ,</l>
     <l n="124">But the instant the hour shall chime ,</l>
     <l n="125">Quick as a flash you must stop , and dash</l>
     <l n="126">Right into a rollicking rhyme ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="19">
     <l n="127">“ What kind of a rhyme ? ” gasped Amos and Ann .</l>
     <l n="128">“ What kind of a rhyme , J. M .? ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="20">
     <l n="129">“ Any kind at all , ” said the Journeying Man ,</l>
     <l n="130">As he twinkled his eyes at them .</l>
     <l n="131">“ But it must begin with the very two sounds ,</l>
     <l n="132">( Or three or four , if you like ,)</l>
     <l n="133">The last few sounds that were on your tongue</l>
     <l n="134">When the clock began to strike ! ”</l>

     <l n="2">They went to the January house ,</l>
     <l n="3">A house made all of snow ,</l>
     <l n="4">With windows of ice , and chandeliers</l>
     <l n="5">Of icicles all in a row .</l>
     <l n="6">The trim young master was dressed in fur</l>
     <l n="7">And did n't seem cold at all —</l>
     <l n="8">A red-cheeked , rollicking , frolicking chap ,</l>
     <l n="9">Who offered each caller an ermine wrap ,</l>
     <l n="10">And let them skate in his hall .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="11">[ Illustration : They went to the January house ]</l>

     <l n="12">While they were skating round the hall , Amos 's feet flew from under him</l>
     <l n="13">and he sat down hard on the ice .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="14">“ Did you break anything ? ” asked the January boy . “ I hope not , indeed , ” he</l>
     <l n="15">added earnestly , “ because so many things are broken here . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="16">“ What kind of things ? ” Amos wanted to know .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>“ Mainly resolutions , ” answered January with a wry face . And then he further said : “ So many of them get broken that sometimes I think I 'll move into another house . ”</p>
   <p>“ But then , ” put in little Ann , “ we should n't have any New Year . And oh , how we 'd miss New Year — ”</p>
   <p>A square-faced clock on the hall-landing struck one just as Ann said she 'd miss New Year .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ Oh ! ” said Ann with a gasp . “ Now I 've got to say a rhyme beginning — ‘ miss</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">“ Miss New Year , miss New Year — ” Then all at once , to her intense</l>
     <l n="4">surprise , she found herself reciting :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="5">“ Miss New Year dressed herself in white ,</l>
     <l n="6">With crystal buttons shining ,</l>
     <l n="7">A spangled scarf , all lacy-light</l>
     <l n="8">About her shoulders twining ;</l>
     <l n="9">A bunch of pearly mistletoe ,</l>
     <l n="10">A twig of ruddy holly ,</l>
     <l n="11">She tucked among her curls , and oh ,</l>
     <l n="12">She was so sweet and jolly !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">“ She tapped upon my window-pane</l>
     <l n="14">And waked me , bright and early .</l>

   <p>“ Wish we could , ” said the Journeying Man , “ but in spite of all these clocks there is no time . I can smell your stew cooking , January —, such stew ! ”</p>
   <p>A clock struck eight just as the Journeying Man said “ such stew . ” Without hesitation he went on :—</p>

     <l n="27">“ Do n't you keep any pets ? ” he said .</l>

   </lg>
   <p>January grinned . “ It would have to be a cold kind of pet , ” he replied . “ And I do n't like seals and walruses . The very animal that I want I can n't have : the alligator has always been my favorite . ”</p>
   <p>“ The alligator ? ” echoed Amos and Ann .</p>
   <p>“ Yes , ” said January , firmly . “ Always the al — ”</p>
   <p>But a little nickel clock caught him just there , so he remarked instead :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Always the alphabet to me</l>
     <l n="2">Is like a happy family .</l>
     <l n="3">They work in groups , they work in pairs ,</l>

   <p>The little valentine girl in the February house was very sociable ; but she talked so much , and there were so many clocks striking all around , that she was always getting side-tracked into a rhyme .</p>
   <p>For example , she was just about to describe a jolly party she went to one day last year , when a clock struck six , and she was obliged to say , instead :—</p>
   <p>“ One day last year , with hems and haws and sidelong steps and nervous caws , the crows came mincing forth to mail gay valentines , you know . The post box was a hollow tree . They did not know , unluckily , that squirrels had gnawed the floor away , and owls moved in below .</p>
   <p>“ The crows went flapping off with glee . They said , ‘ Our woodland friends will see that , though we dress so solemnly , we 're sociable at heart . ’</p>
   <p>“ The valentines came hurrying down , came scurrying down , came flurrying down , and waked the owls , all fast asleep , and gave them quite a start .</p>
   <p>“ ‘ What 's this , my dear , amiss , my dear ? ’ cried Father Owl .</p>
   <p>“ ‘ Oh , bliss , my dear , ’ said Mrs. Owl . ‘ A shower of mail for us . How very fine ! ’</p>
   <p>“ The daughter owls were full of joy , and quick the little owlet boy ruffed up his feathers roguishly and seized a valentine .</p>
   <p>“ Excitement reigned among those owls ; but , being such nocturnal fowls , they could not read the valentines at all in broad daylight . They blinked a bit and winked a bit , but found them not distinct a bit ; then did not go to bed again , but waited for the night .</p>
   <p>“ Just after dusk a thing occurred , unfortunate for every bird : a wild , wild wind came romping in ( it was a dreadful prank ) , and with a swoop , in boisterous play , swept all the envelopes away .</p>
   <p>“ The poor owls cried , ‘ Alackaday , we sha n't know whom to thank ! ’</p>
   <p>“ Next morning all the crows came out and pranced about and glanced about , expecting greetings from their friends , and praise , and everything ; but when they got no single word of gratitude from any bird , they held a meeting in the trees that made the whole woods ring .</p>
   <p>“ Oh , well , it surely seemed a shame , but no one really was to blame ; and this year all the birds around ( I heard it from a wren ) will put their mail most carefully safe in a holeproof hollow tree . And every crow is going to be a happy crow again ! ”</p>
   <p>Little Ann was enchanted with the February house ; she planned in her own mind to copy it in chocolate and taffy .</p>
   <p>“ I 'd like to see upstairs ,— the beds and bureaus and things ,— ” she said shyly , “ if you do n't mind my looking — ”</p>
   <p>A big clock began to boom somewhere near .</p>
   <p>“ My looking — ” repeated Ann . “ Dear me suz , I 'm caught again ! What shall I say ? ”</p>
   <p>Then all at once she said :—</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ My looking-glass is like a pool ,</l>
     <l n="2">As still and clear , as blank and cool .</l>

   <p>Amos smiled proudly . “ So I have , ” he said . He was about to go on to say that he wondered if he would be caught at all , when — whiz ! with a scramble and a scuffle a cuckoo rushed out of a clock just above his head and bobbed intently up and down twelve times . Amos had got only as far as “ wonder . ” “ Wonder — wonder — ” he stammered , as he heard the clock . “ Wonder — wonder —</p>

   <p>“ No clocks here , anyway ! ” she exclaimed .</p>
