    <head>INTRODUCTION</head>
    <p n="1">This syllabus , or finding-list , is offered to lovers of folk-literature in the hope that it may not be without interest and value to them for purposes of comparison and identification . It includes 333 items , exclusive of 114 variants , and embraces all popular songs that have so far come to hand as having been “ learned by ear instead of by eye , ” as existing through oral transmission — song-ballads , love-songs , number-songs , dance-songs , play-songs , child-songs , counting-out rimes , lullabies , jigs , nonsense rimes , ditties , etc .</p>
    <p n="2">There is every reason to believe that many more such await the collector ; in fact , their number is constantly being increased even today by the creation of new ones , by adaptation of the old , and even by the absorption and consequent metamorphosis , of literary , quasi-literary , or pseudo-literary types into the current of oral tradition .</p>
    <p n="3">This collection , then , is by no means complete : means have not been available for a systematic and scientific search for these folk-songs , which have been gathered very casually during the past five years through occasional travel , acquaintanceship , and correspondence in only the twenty-one following counties : Fayette , Madison , Rowan , Elliott , Carter , Boyd , Lawrence , Morgan , Johnson , Pike , Knott , Breathitt , Clay , Laurel , Rockcastle , Garrard , Boyle , Anderson , Shelby , Henry , and Owen — all lying in Central and Eastern Kentucky .</p>
    <p n="4">All of the material listed has thus been collected in this State , though a variant of The Jew 's Daughter , page 8 , has come by chance from Michigan , and another of The Pretty Mohee , page 12 , was sent from Georgia . The Cumberland Mountain region , in the eastern part of the State , has naturally furnished the larger half of the material , because of local conditions favorable to the propagation of folk-song . However , sections of Kentucky lying farther to the westward are almost equally prolific . The wide extension of the same ballad throughout the State argues convincingly for the unity of the Kentucky stock — a fact which may be confirmed in more ways than one .</p>
    <p n="5">The arrangement is as follows : The material in hand is loosely grouped in eighteen sections , according to origin , chronology , content , or form . Though logically at fault , because of the cross-division thus inevitably entailed , this plan has seemed to be the best . No real confusion will result to the user in consequence . In fact , no matter what system be adopted , certain songs will belong equally well to two or more different categories .</p>
    <p n="6">Under each of these eighteen main divisions the treatment of the individual song-ballad is in general as follows : First , stands the title , with variant titles in parentheses . Should this be unknown , a caption coined by the editors is placed in brackets . Secondly , a Roman numeral immediately follows the above to denote the number of versions , if variants have been found . Thirdly , the prosodical character of the song is roughly indicated by a combination of letters and numerals . Each letter indicates a line ; the variation in the letters indicates , in the usual fashion , the rime-scheme of the stanza . Each numeral indicates the number of stresses in the line ( or lines ) denoted by the letter ( or letters ) immediately succeeding it . When a chorus , burden , or refrain is present , the metrical scheme of this stands immediately after an “ and , ” as , for example , in The Blue and the Gray , page 14 . In the case of the refrain , the letters used are independent of those immediately preceding the “ and , ” and denoting the rime-scheme of the stanza proper . Fourthly , an Arabic numeral follows to indicate the number of stanzas in the song , exclusive of the refrain , should one be present . If the number of stanzas in a ballad is indeterminable , because its form is fragmentary , or because its variant versions differ in length , this fact is indicated by an appended ca ( circa ) . Sixth , and last , is a synopsis , or other attempt to give briefly such data as may serve to complete the identification .</p>
    <p n="7">Illustration of the third item above may be helpful . Thus in Pretty Polly , on page 7 , 4aabb indicates a quatrain riming in couplets , with four stresses in each line . In Jackaro , page 9 , 3abcb indicates a quatrain riming alternately , with three stressed syllables in each line . In The King 's Daughter , page 7 , 4a3b4c3b indicates a quatrain , with only the second and fourth lines riming and with four stresses in the first and third lines and three stresses in the second and fourth . In Johnnie Came from Sea , page 14 , 6aa denotes a rimed couplet , with six stresses in each line .</p>
    <p n="8">It has , naturally , been difficult at times to decide whether certain stanzas should be counted as couplets , or as quatrains half as long . In such cases , the air , or tune , and other data , often rather subtle , have been employed in making decisions . The quatrain form has in uncertain instances been given the benefit of the doubt . Even thus , certain minor inconsistencies will perhaps be noted . It is hardly necessary to add that assonance freely occurs in the place of rime , and as such it is considered throughout .</p>
    <p n="9">All attempt to indicate the prevailing metrical unit , or foot , within the line has been frankly given over . Iambs , dactyls , and their ilk receive scant courtesy from the composer of folk-song , who without qualm or quaver will stretch one syllable , or even an utter silence ( caesura ) , into the time of a complete bar ; while in the next breath he will with equal equanimity huddle a dozen syllables into the same period . Consequently , this item , even if it could be indicated , would have scant descriptive value .</p>
    <p n="10">It is a pleasant duty to acknowledge gratefully the assistance of those who have transmitted to our hands many of the songs : Mesdames J. W. Combs , W. T. Phillips , Jennie L. Combs , Richard Smith , Martha Smith , Ruth Hackney , W. F. Hays , Ollie Huff , Robin Cornett , Lucy Banks , Sarah Burton , Kittie Jordan , and Ruby Martin ; Misses Martha Jent , Maud Dean , Virginia Jordan , Jessie Green , Lizzie Cody , Margaret Combs , Barbara Smith , Helena E. Rose , Sarah Burton , Sarah Hillman , Cordia Bramblett , Nannie S. Graham , Myrtle Wheeler , Melissa Holbrook , Rosetta Wheeler , Ruth Hackney , Ora McDavid , Jeannette McDavid ; Messrs. Wm . W. Berry , Chas . Hackney , S. B. Wheeler , R. L. Morgan , Enoch Wheeler , Thos . H. Hackney , James Goodman , W. S. Wheeler , Harry M. Morgan , Henry Lester , T. G. Wheeler , C. F. Bishop , and John C. Jones .</p>
    <p n="11">Especially helpful as collaborators have been Messrs. Winfred Cox , Emory E. Wheeler , Roud Shaw , A . B. Johnston , C. E. Phillips , and H. Williamson .</p>
    <p n="12">Kind words or letters of appreciation and , in some cases , of suggestion , from the following have encouraged the preparation of this syllabus : Professors Alexander S. Mackenzie , of the Kentucky State University ; Clarence C. Freeman , of Transylvania University ; John A. Lomax , of the University of Texas ; Albert H. Tolman , of the University of Chicago ; John M. McBride , Jr ., of the University of the South ; George Lyman Kittredge , of Harvard University ; Henry M. Belden , of the University of Missouri ; and Katherine Jackson , formerly of Bryn Mawr College , who has most generously given the use of her manuscript collection . None of the shortcomings of this brochure , however , can be imputed to them in the slightest degree .</p>

   <p>This group contains paralipomena which baffle individual description . It embraces counting-out rimes , jigs , lullabies , child-rimes , nonsense-rimes , and ditties . They are always rhythmical , and usually rimed , varying in length from a couplet to an endless improvisation . The following list is an attempt to name them :</p>
