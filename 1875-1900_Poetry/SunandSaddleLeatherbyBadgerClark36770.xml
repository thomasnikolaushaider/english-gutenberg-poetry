   <div type="dedication">
    <p>TO MY FATHER , who , in his long life , has seldom been conscious of a man 's rough exterior , or unconscious of his obscurest virtue .</p>
   </div>
   <div type="preface">
    <head>PREFACE TO THE THIRD EDITION</head>
    <p n="1">Cowboys are the sternest critics of those who would represent the West . No hypocrisy , no bluff , no pose can evade them .</p>
    <p n="2">Yet cowboys have made Badger Clark 's songs their own . So readily have they circulated that often the man who sings the song could not tell you where it started . Many of the poems have become folk songs of the West , we may say of America , for they speak of freedom and the open .</p>
    <p n="3">Generous has been the praise given Sun and Saddle Leather , but perhaps no criticism has summed up the work so satisfactorily as the comment of the old cow man who said , “ You can break me if there 's a dead poem in the book , I read the hull of it . Who in H —— is this kid Clark , anyway ? I do n't know how he knowed , but he knows . ”</p>
    <p n="4">That is what proves Badger Clark the real poet . He knows . Beyond his wonderful presentation of the West is the quality of universal appeal that makes his work real art . He has tied the West to the universe .</p>
    <p n="5">The old cow man is not the only one who has wondered who Badger Clark was . Charles Wharton Stork speaking of Sun and Saddle Leather , said , “ It has splendid flavor and fine artistic handling as well . I should like to know more of the author , whether he was a cow puncher or merely got inside his psychology by imagination . ”</p>
    <p n="6">Badger Clark was brought up in the West . As a boy he lived in Deadwood , South Dakota . The town at that time was trying to live down the reputation for exuberant indecorum which she had acquired during the gold rush ; but her five churches operating two hours a week could make little headway against the competition of two dance halls and twenty-six saloons running twenty-four hours a day .</p>
    <p n="7">Perhaps it was these early impressions that make The Piano at Red 's in Mr. Clark 's later volume Grass Grown Trails so vivid .</p>
    <p n="8">Scuffling feet and thud of fists , Curses hot as fire — Still the music sang of love , Longin ’ , lost desire , Dreams that never could have been Joys that could n't stay — While the man upon the floor Wiped the blood away .</p>
    <p n="9">After Clark had grown up , in the cow country near the Mexican border , he stumbled unexpectedly into paradise . He was given charge of a small ranch and the responsibility for a bunch of cattle just large enough to amuse him , but too small to demand a full day 's work once a month . The sky was persistently blue , the sunlight was richly golden , the folds of the barren mountains and the wide reaches of the range were full of many lovely colors , and his nearest neighbor was eight miles away .</p>
    <p n="10">The cow men who dropped in for a meal now and then in the course of their interminable riding appeared to have ridden directly out of books of adventure , with old-young faces full of sun wrinkles , careless mouths full of bad grammar , strange oaths and stranger yarns , and hearts for the most part as open and shadowless as the country they daily ranged .</p>
    <p n="11">In the evenings as Clark placed his boot heels on the porch railing , smote the strings of his guitar and broke the tense silence of the warm , dry twilight with song , he often wondered , as his eyes rested dreamily on the spikey yuccas that stood out sharp and black against the clear lemon color of the sunset west , why hermit life in the desert was traditionally a sad , penitential affair .</p>
    <p n="12">In a letter to his mother a month or two after settling in Arizona he found prose too weak to express his utter content and perpetrated his first verses . She , with natural pride , sent the verses to a magazine , the old Pacific Monthly , and a week or two later the desert dweller was astonished beyond measure to receive his first editorial check . The discovery that certain people in the world were willing to pay money for such rhymes as he could write bent the whole course of his subsequent life , for good or evil , and the occasional lyric impulse hardened into a habit which has consumed much of his time and most of his serious thought since that date . The verses written to his mother were Ridin ’ , the first poem in his first book , Sun and Saddle Leather , and the greater part of the poems in both Sun and Saddle Leather and Grass Grown Trails were written in Arizona .</p>
    <p n="13">Sun and Saddle Leather and Grass Grown Trails are books of Western songs , simple and ringing and yet with an ample vision that makes them unique among poems written in a local vernacular . The spirit of them is eternal , the spirit of youth in the open , and their background is “ God 's Reserves , ” the vast reach of Western mesa and plain that will always remain free — “ the way that it was when the world was new . ”</p>
    <p n="14">Every poem carries a breath of plains , wind-flavored with a tang of camp smoke ; and , varied as they are in tune and tone , they do not contain a single note that is labored or unnatural . They are of native Western stock , as indigenous to the soil as the agile cow ponies whose hoofs evidently beat the time for their swinging measures ; and it is this quality , as well as their appealing music , that has already given them such wide popularity , East and West .</p>
    <p n="15">That they were born in the saddle and written for love rather than for publication is a conviction that the reader of them can hardly escape . From the impish merriment of From Town to the deep but fearless piety of The Cowboy 's Prayer , these songs ring true ; and are as healthy as the big , bright country whence they came .</p>
    <p n="16">In 1917 , about the time our first edition of Sun and Saddle Leather began to run low , we fortunately discovered L. A. Huffman , of Miles City , Montana , the illustrator who in 1878 began taking photographs from the saddle with crude cameras he made over to meet his needs . These same views were the first of the now famous “ Huffman Pictures , ” beginning with the Indians and buffaloes round about Ft. Keogh on the Yellowstone where he was post photographer for General Miles ’ army during those stirring territorial days . The Huffman Studio is still one of the show places of Miles City , and the sales headquarters also for Montana and adjacent states for both of Mr. Clark 's books , Sun and Saddle Leather and Grass Grown Trails . In a recent letter Mr. Huffman says , “ I have just come back from a trip to ‘ Powder River ’ and along the Wyoming-Montana border . It 's all too true ! Clark saw and wrote it none too soon in The Passing of the Trail . ”</p>
    <p n="17">The trail 's a lane , the trail 's a lane . Dead is the branding fire . The prairies wild are tame and mild All close-corralled with wire . The sunburnt demigods who ranged And laughed and loved so free Have topped the last divide , or changed To men like you and me .</p>

    <head>THE WESTERNER</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">My fathers sleep on the sunrise plains ,</l>
     <l n="2">And each one sleeps alone .</l>
     <l n="3">Their trails may dim to the grass and rains ,</l>
     <l n="4">For I choose to make my own .</l>
     <l n="5">I lay proud claim to their blood and name ,</l>
     <l n="6">But I lean on no dead kin ;</l>
     <l n="7">My name is mine , for the praise or scorn ,</l>
     <l n="8">And the world began when I was born</l>
     <l n="9">And the world is mine to win .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="10">They built high towns on their old log sills ,</l>
     <l n="11">Where the great , slow rivers gleamed ,</l>
     <l n="12">But with new , live rock from the savage hills</l>
     <l n="13">I 'll build as they only dreamed .</l>
     <l n="14">The smoke scarce dies where the trail camp lies ,</l>
     <l n="15">Till the rails glint down the pass ;</l>
     <l n="16">The desert springs into fruit and wheat</l>
     <l n="17">And I lay the stones of a solid street</l>
     <l n="18">Over yesterday 's untrod grass .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="19">I waste no thought on my neighbor 's birth</l>
     <l n="20">Or the way he makes his prayer .</l>
     <l n="21">I grant him a white man 's room on earth</l>
     <l n="22">If his game is only square .</l>
     <l n="23">While he plays it straight I 'll call him mate ;</l>
     <l n="24">If he cheats I drop him flat .</l>
     <l n="25">Old class and rank are a wornout lie ,</l>
     <l n="26">For all clean men are as good as I ,</l>
     <l n="27">And a king is only that .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="28">I dream no dreams of a nurse-maid state</l>
     <l n="29">That will spoon me out my food .</l>
     <l n="30">A stout heart sings in the fray with fate</l>
     <l n="31">And the shock and sweat are good .</l>
     <l n="32">From noon to noon all the earthly boon</l>
     <l n="33">That I ask my God to spare</l>
     <l n="34">Is a little daily bread in store ,</l>
     <l n="35">With the room to fight the strong for more ,</l>
     <l n="36">And the weak shall get their share .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="37">The sunrise plains are a tender haze</l>
     <l n="38">And the sunset seas are gray ,</l>
     <l n="39">But I stand here , where the bright skies blaze</l>
     <l n="40">Over me and the big today .</l>
     <l n="41">What good to me is a vague “ may be ”</l>
     <l n="42">Or a mournful “ might have been , ”</l>
     <l n="43">For the sun wheels swift from morn to morn</l>
     <l n="44">And the world began when I was born</l>
     <l n="45">And the world is mine to win .</l>

     <l n="1">My tired hawse nickers for his own home bars ;</l>
     <l n="2">A hoof clicks out a spark .</l>
     <l n="3">The dim creek flickers to the lonesome stars ;</l>
     <l n="4">The trail twists down the dark .</l>
     <l n="5">The ridge pines whimper to the pines below .</l>
     <l n="6">The wind is blowin ’ and I want you so .</l>

     <l n="7">The birch has yellowed since I saw you last ,</l>
     <l n="8">The Fall haze blued the creeks ,</l>
     <l n="9">The big pine bellowed as the snow swished past ,</l>
     <l n="10">But still , above the peaks ,</l>
     <l n="11">The same stars twinkle that we used to know .</l>
     <l n="12">The wind is blowin ’ and I want you so .</l>

     <l n="13">The stars up yonder wait the end of time</l>
     <l n="14">But earth fires soon go black .</l>
     <l n="15">I trip and wander on the trail I climb —</l>
     <l n="16">A fool who will look back</l>
     <l n="17">To glimpse a fire dead a year ago .</l>
     <l n="18">The wind is blowin ’ and I want you so .</l>

     <l n="19">Who says the lover kills the man in me ?</l>
     <l n="20">Beneath the day 's hot blue</l>
     <l n="21">This thing hunts cover and my heart fights free</l>
     <l n="22">To laugh an hour or two .</l>
     <l n="23">But now it wavers like a wounded doe .</l>
     <l n="24">The wind is blowin ’ and I want you so .</l>

     <l n="1">Up from the prairie and through the pines ,</l>
     <l n="2">Over your straggling headboard lines</l>
     <l n="3">Winds of the West go by .</l>
     <l n="4">You must love them , you booted dead ,</l>
     <l n="5">More than the dreamers who died in bed —</l>

     <l n="25">There , in eternally fenceless West ,</l>
     <l n="26">Rest to your souls , if they care to rest ,</l>
     <l n="27">Or else fresh horses beyond the crest</l>
     <l n="28">And a star-speckled range to ride .</l>
