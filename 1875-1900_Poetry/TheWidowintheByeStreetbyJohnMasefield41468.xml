     <lg type="stanza" n="4">
      <l n="6">Down Bye Street , in a little Shropshire town ,</l>
      <l n="7">There lived a widow with her only son :</l>
      <l n="8">She had no wealth nor title to renown ,</l>
      <l n="9">Nor any joyous hours , never one .</l>
      <l n="10">She rose from ragged mattress before sun</l>
      <l n="11">And stitched all day until her eyes were red ,</l>
      <l n="12">And had to stitch , because her man was dead .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="5">
      <l n="13">Sometimes she fell asleep , she stitched so hard ,</l>
      <l n="14">Letting the linen fall upon the floor ;</l>
      <l n="15">And hungry cats would steal in from the yard ,</l>
      <l n="16">And mangy chickens pecked about the door</l>
      <l n="17">Craning their necks so ragged and so sore</l>
      <l n="18">To search the room for bread-crumbs , or for mouse ,</l>
      <l n="19">But they got nothing in the widow 's house .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="6">
      <l n="20">Mostly she made her bread by hemming shrouds</l>
      <l n="21">For one rich undertaker in the High Street ,</l>
      <l n="22">Who used to pray that folks might die in crowds</l>
      <l n="23">And that their friends might pay to let them lie sweet ;</l>
      <l n="24">And when one died the widow in the Bye Street</l>
      <l n="25">Stitched night and day to give the worm his dole .</l>
      <l n="26">The dead were better dressed than that poor soul .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="7">
      <l n="27">Her little son was all her life 's delight ,</l>
      <l n="28">For in his little features she could find</l>
      <l n="29">A glimpse of that dead husband out of sight ,</l>
      <l n="30">Where out of sight is never out of mind .</l>
      <l n="31">And so she stitched till she was nearly blind ,</l>
      <l n="32">Or till the tallow candle end was done ,</l>
      <l n="33">To get a living for her little son .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="8">
      <l n="34">Her love for him being such she would not rest ,</l>
      <l n="35">It was a want which ate her out and in ,</l>
      <l n="36">Another hunger in her withered breast</l>
      <l n="37">Pressing her woman 's bones against the skin .</l>
      <l n="38">To make him plump she starved her body thin .</l>
      <l n="39">And he , he ate the food , and never knew ,</l>
      <l n="40">He laughed and played as little children do .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="9">
      <l n="41">When there was little sickness in the place</l>
      <l n="42">She took what God would send , and what God sent</l>
      <l n="43">Never brought any colour to her face</l>
      <l n="44">Nor life into her footsteps when she went</l>
      <l n="45">Going , she trembled always withered and bent</l>
      <l n="46">For all went to her son , always the same ,</l>
      <l n="47">He was first served whatever blessing came .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="10">
      <l n="48">Sometimes she wandered out to gather sticks ,</l>
      <l n="49">For it was bitter cold there when it snowed .</l>
      <l n="50">And she stole hay out of the farmer 's ricks</l>
      <l n="51">For bands to wrap her feet in while she sewed ,</l>
      <l n="52">And when her feet were warm and the grate glowed</l>
      <l n="53">She hugged her little son , her heart 's desire ,</l>
      <l n="54">With ‘ Jimmy , ai n't it snug beside the fire ? ’</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="11">
      <l n="55">So years went on till Jimmy was a lad</l>
      <l n="56">And went to work as poor lads have to do ,</l>
      <l n="57">And then the widow 's loving heart was glad</l>
      <l n="58">To know that all the pains she had gone through</l>
      <l n="59">And all the years of putting on the screw ,</l>
      <l n="60">Down to the sharpest turn a mortal can ,</l>
      <l n="61">Had borne their fruit , and made her child a man .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="12">
      <l n="62">He got a job at working on the line</l>
      <l n="63">Tipping the earth down , trolly after truck ,</l>
      <l n="64">From daylight till the evening , wet or fine ,</l>
      <l n="65">With arms all red from wallowing in the muck ,</l>
      <l n="66">And spitting , as the trolly tipped , for luck ,</l>
      <l n="67">And singing ‘ Binger ’ as he swung the pick</l>
      <l n="68">Because the red blood ran in him so quick .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="13">
      <l n="69">So there was bacon then , at night , for supper</l>
      <l n="70">In Bye Street there , where he and mother stay ;</l>
      <l n="71">And boots they had , not leaky in the upper ,</l>
      <l n="72">And room rent ready on the settling day ;</l>
      <l n="73">And beer for poor old mother , worn and grey ,</l>
      <l n="74">And fire in frost ; and in the widow 's eyes</l>
      <l n="75">It seemed the Lord had made earth paradise .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="14">
      <l n="76">And there they sat of evenings after dark</l>
      <l n="77">Singing their song of ‘ Binger , ’ he and she ,</l>
      <l n="78">Her poor old cackle made the mongrels bark</l>
      <l n="79">And ‘ You sing Binger , mother , ’ carols he ;</l>
      <l n="80">‘ By crimes , but that 's a good song , that her be ':</l>
      <l n="81">And then they slept there in the room they shared ,</l>
      <l n="82">And all the time fate had his end prepared .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="15">
      <l n="83">One thing alone made life not perfect sweet :</l>
      <l n="84">The mother 's daily fear of what would come</l>
      <l n="85">When woman and her lovely boy should meet ,</l>
      <l n="86">When the new wife would break up the old home .</l>
      <l n="87">Fear of that unborn evil struck her dumb ,</l>
      <l n="88">And when her darling and a woman met ,</l>
      <l n="89">She shook and prayed , ‘ Not her , O God ; not yet . ’</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="16">
      <l n="90">‘ Not yet , dear God , my Jimmy go from me . ’</l>
      <l n="91">Then she would subtly question with her son .</l>
      <l n="92">‘ Not very handsome , I do n't think her be ? ’</l>
      <l n="93">‘ God help the man who marries such an one . ’</l>
      <l n="94">Her red eyes peered to spy the mischief done .</l>
      <l n="95">She took great care to keep the girls away ,</l>
      <l n="96">And all her trouble made him easier prey .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="17">
      <l n="97">There was a woman out at Plaister 's End ,</l>
      <l n="98">Light of her body , fifty to the pound ,</l>
      <l n="99">A copper coin for any man to spend ,</l>
      <l n="100">Lovely to look on when the wits were drowned .</l>
      <l n="101">Her husband 's skeleton was never found ,</l>
      <l n="102">It lay among the rocks at Glydyr Mor</l>
      <l n="103">Where he drank poison finding her a whore .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="18">
      <l n="104">She was not native there , for she belonged</l>
      <l n="105">Out Milford way , or Swansea ; no one knew .</l>
      <l n="106">She had the piteous look of someone wronged ,</l>
      <l n="107">‘ Anna , ’ her name , a widow , last of Triw .</l>
      <l n="108">She had lived at Plaister 's End a year or two ;</l>
      <l n="109">At Callow 's cottage , renting half an acre ;</l>
      <l n="110">She was a hen-wife and a perfume-maker .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="19">
      <l n="111">Secret she was ; she lived in reputation ;</l>
      <l n="112">But secret unseen threads went floating out :</l>
      <l n="113">Her smile , her voice , her face , were all temptation ,</l>
      <l n="114">All subtle flies to trouble man the trout ;</l>
      <l n="115">Man to entice , entrap , entangle , flout ...</l>
      <l n="116">To take and spoil , and then to cast aside :</l>
      <l n="117">Gain without giving was the craft she plied .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="20">
      <l n="118">And she complained , poor lonely widowed soul ,</l>
      <l n="119">How no one cared , and men were rutters all ;</l>
      <l n="120">While true love is an ever-burning goal</l>
      <l n="121">Burning the brighter as the shadows fall .</l>
      <l n="122">And all love 's dogs went hunting at the call ,</l>
      <l n="123">Married or not she took them by the brain ,</l>
      <l n="124">Sucked at their hearts and tossed them back again .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="21">
      <l n="125">Like the straw fires lit on Saint John 's Eve ,</l>
      <l n="126">She burned and dwindled in her fickle heart ;</l>
      <l n="127">For if she wept when Harry took his leave ,</l>
      <l n="128">Her tears were lures to beckon Bob to start .</l>
      <l n="129">And if , while loving Bob , a tinker 's cart</l>
      <l n="130">Came by , she opened window with a smile</l>
      <l n="131">And gave the tinker hints to wait a while .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="22">
      <l n="132">She passed for pure ; but , years before , in Wales ,</l>
      <l n="133">Living at Mountain Ash with different men ,</l>
      <l n="134">Her less discretion had inspired tales</l>
      <l n="135">Of certain things she did , and how , and when .</l>
      <l n="136">Those seven years of youth ; we are frantic then .</l>
      <l n="137">She had been frantic in her years of youth ,</l>
      <l n="138">The tales were not more evil than the truth .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="23">
      <l n="139">She had two children as the fruits of trade</l>
      <l n="140">Though she drank bitter herbs to kill the curse ,</l>
      <l n="141">Both of them sons , and one she overlaid ,</l>
      <l n="142">The other one the parish had to nurse .</l>
      <l n="143">Now she grew plump with money in her purse ,</l>
      <l n="144">Passing for pure a hundred miles , I guess ,</l>
      <l n="145">From where her little son wore workhouse dress .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="24">
      <l n="146">There with the Union boys he came and went ,</l>
      <l n="147">A parish bastard fed on bread and tea ,</l>
      <l n="148">Wearing a bright tin badge in furthest Gwent ,</l>
      <l n="149">And no one knowing who his folk could be .</l>
      <l n="150">His mother never knew his new name : she ,—</l>
      <l n="151">She touched the lust of those who served her turn ,</l>
      <l n="152">And chief among her men was Shepherd Ern .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="25">
      <l n="153">A moody , treacherous man of bawdy mind ,</l>
      <l n="154">Married to that mild girl from Ercall Hill ,</l>
      <l n="155">Whose gentle goodness made him more inclined</l>
      <l n="156">To hotter sauces sharper on the bill .</l>
      <l n="157">The new lust gives the lecher the new thrill ,</l>
      <l n="158">The new wine scratches as it slips the throat ,</l>
      <l n="159">The new flag is so bright by the old boat .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="26">
      <l n="160">Ern was her man to buy her bread and meat ,</l>
      <l n="161">Half of his weekly wage was hers to spend ,</l>
      <l n="162">She used to mock ‘ How is your wife , my sweet ? ’</l>
      <l n="163">Or wail , ‘ O , Ernie , how is this to end ? ’</l>
      <l n="164">Or coo , ‘ My Ernie is without a friend ,</l>
      <l n="165">She cannot understand my precious life , ’</l>
      <l n="166">And Ernie would go home and beat his wife .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="27">
      <l n="167">So the four souls are ranged , the chess-board set ,</l>
      <l n="168">The dark , invisible hand of secret Fate</l>
      <l n="169">Brought it to come to being that they met</l>
      <l n="170">After so many years of lying in wait .</l>
      <l n="171">While we least think it he prepares his Mate .</l>
      <l n="172">Mate , and the King 's pawn played , it never ceases</l>
      <l n="173">Though all the earth is dust of taken pieces .</l>
     </lg>

    <lg type="part" n="2">
     <head>II</head>
     <lg type="stanza" n="28">
      <l n="174">October Fair-time is the time for fun ,</l>
      <l n="175">For all the street is hurdled into rows</l>
      <l n="176">Of pens of heifers blinking at the sun ,</l>
      <l n="177">And Lemster sheep which pant and seem to doze ,</l>
      <l n="178">And stalls of hardbake and galanty shows ,</l>
      <l n="179">And cheapjacks smashing crocks , and trumpets blowing ,</l>
      <l n="180">And the loud organ of the horses going .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="29">
      <l n="181">There you can buy blue ribbons for your girl</l>
      <l n="182">Or take her in a swing-boat tossing high ,</l>
      <l n="183">Or hold her fast when all the horses whirl</l>
      <l n="184">Round to the steam pipe whanging at the sky ,</l>
      <l n="185">Or stand her cockshies at the cocoa-shy ,</l>
      <l n="186">Or buy her brooches with her name in red ,</l>
      <l n="187">Or Queen Victoria done in gingerbread .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="30">
      <l n="188">Then there are rifle shots at tossing balls ,</l>
      <l n="189">‘ And if you hit you get a good cigar . ’</l>
      <l n="190">And strength-whackers for lads to lamm with mauls ,</l>
      <l n="191">And Cheshire cheeses on a greasy spar .</l>
      <l n="192">The country folk flock in from near and far ,</l>
      <l n="193">Women and men , like blow-flies to the roast ,</l>
      <l n="194">All love the fair ; but Anna loved it most .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="31">
      <l n="195">Anna was all agog to see the fair ;</l>
      <l n="196">She made Ern promise to be there to meet her ,</l>
      <l n="197">To arm her round to all the pleasures there ,</l>
      <l n="198">And buy her ribbons for her neck , and treat her ,</l>
      <l n="199">So that no woman at the fair should beat her</l>
      <l n="200">In having pleasure at a man 's expense .</l>
      <l n="201">She planned to meet him at the chapel fence .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="32">
      <l n="202">So Ernie went ; and Jimmy took his mother ,</l>
      <l n="203">Dressed in her finest with a Monmouth shawl ,</l>
      <l n="204">And there was such a crowd she thought she 'd smother ,</l>
      <l n="205">And O , she loved a pep'mint above all .</l>
      <l n="206">Clash go the crockeries where the cheapjacks bawl ,</l>
      <l n="207">Baa go the sheep , thud goes the waxwork 's drum ,</l>
      <l n="208">And Ernie cursed for Anna had n't come .</l>

     <lg type="stanza" n="33">
      <l n="209">He hunted for her up and down the place ,</l>
      <l n="210">Raging and snapping like a working brew .</l>

      <l n="212">And when I 've done for him I 'll go for you . ’</l>
      <l n="213">He bought no fairings as he 'd vowed to do</l>
      <l n="214">For his poor little children back at home</l>
      <l n="215">Stuck at the glass ‘ to see till father come . ’</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="34">
      <l n="216">Not finding her , he went into an inn ,</l>
      <l n="217">Busy with ringing till and scratching matches .</l>
      <l n="218">Where thirsty drovers mingled stout with gin</l>

   <p>SOME OPINIONS OF THE PRESS</p>
   <p>“ Mr Masefield is to be congratulated on a remarkable achievement — a vital portrait of a man , the drama of a great spiritual conquest , and many passages of high beauty . ” — Spectator .</p>
   <p>“ This is probably the most important addition to English religious poetry since Francis Thompson wrote ‘ The Hound of Heaven . ’ ‘ The Everlasting Mercy ’ is the story of a conversion ; not the ‘ interesting ’ conversion of some cultured and introspective Agnostic , full of wise saws and modern instances , but the sensational , primitive , catastrophic conversion of a village wastrel , violent alike in body , mind and soul — a drunkard , poacher , bully and libertine .... In it Mr Masefield has accomplished two separate things . He has written a superb poem , swift in its pace and vivid in its phrasing , and produced as well a psychological document of surpassing interest .... He has brought the flaming torch of beauty to light the dry processes of the religious psychologist . ” — EVELYN UNDERHILL in The Daily News .</p>
   <p>“ Here , beyond question , in ‘ The Everlasting Mercy , ’ is a great poem , as true to the essentials of its ancient art as it is astoundingly modern in its method ; a poem , too , which ‘ every clergyman in the country ought to read as a revelation of the heathenism still left in the land . ’ ... Its technical force is on a level with its high , inspiring thought . It makes the reader think ; it goads him to emotion ; and it leaves him alive with a fresh appreciation of the wonderful capacity of human nature to receive new influences and atone for old and apparently ineradicable wrongs . ” — ARTHUR WAUGH in The Daily Chronicle .</p>

   <p>“ Fine , nervous , dramatic English . Words which eat into the soul , which have a meaning , which are revelatory of character . A fine virility about the whole play and its conception . An altogether admirable piece of writing which fully justifies Mr Masefield 's real literary distinction . ” — Observer .</p>
   <p>“ In this Roman tragedy , while we admire its closely knit structure , dramatic effectiveness , and atmosphere of reality ... the warmth and colour of the diction are the most notable things .... He knows the art of phrasing ; he has the instinct for and by them . ” — Athenaeum .</p>
   <p>“ The talk of Pompey , of Domitius , of Acilius , is not that of great lords , but rather of men like Hawkins and Drake . This is the result of Mr Masefield 's imaginative handling . He sees them so , and so they live . They live indeed . Their characters are clear and bold ; they say nothing but what reveals them and helps to make the tragedy a rich as well as a moving thing . It is poetry . It is almost music , and on the first few pages there are notes that linger with us to the end , haunting us like the blowing of horns in an old and silent forest . ” — Mr EDWARD THOMAS in The Daily Chronicle .</p>
   <p>“ He has written a great tragedy .... The dialogue is written in strong , simple , and nervous prose , flashing with poetic insight , significance , and suggestion . The characters are intensely alive , the situations are handled by a master hand , and the whole play is pregnant with that high and solemn pathos which is the gift of the born writer of tragedies . ” — Morning Post .</p>
