For oh , you were not idle , Whatever men might say — You made the colour of the year Magnificent and gay .</titlePart></docTitle>

       <l n="2">The dim florescence of a mystic rose ,</l>
       <l n="3">In poverty or pride love comes and goes ,</l>
       <l n="4">We do not question what the deeps may seem</l>
       <l n="5">Launched on the steady current of the stream .</l>
       <l n="6">Gaily and hardily we hear the prose ;</l>
       <l n="7">In youth , red sun , in age the charnel snows .</l>
       <l n="8">Nor see the banks where subtle flowers gleam ,</l>
       <l n="9">In green sweet beds of moly and of thyme</l>
       <l n="10">Wild as an errant fancy . All the while</l>
       <l n="11">We know you , mystic rose ; we know your smile ,</l>
       <l n="12">Your deep , still eyes , your fragrant floating hair ,</l>
       <l n="13">The peacock purple of the gown you wear ,</l>

       <l n="3">I did not shrink before the utmost sting</l>
       <l n="4">Of torture or of banishment . The pall</l>
       <l n="5">Of Dis , I cried , should be the hall</l>
       <l n="6">Where sad proud men of men should meet and sing</l>
       <l n="7">The woes of that defeat ambitions bring</l>

       <l n="12">Yet still a Prince , Ah God , I dreamed ,— and then</l>
       <l n="13">I learned my Fate , this wandering to and fro</l>

       <l n="6">Maybe , that one may hear the moans and cries</l>
       <l n="7">That ring by night , and yet be calm and wise .</l>

       <l n="12">Was this , he squeezed the fruit so dry</l>
       <l n="13">So long ago ; and now must live , forsooth</l>
       <l n="14">Because a woman will not let him die .</l>
