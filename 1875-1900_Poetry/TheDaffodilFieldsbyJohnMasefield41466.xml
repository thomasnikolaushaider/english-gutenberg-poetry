    <head>I</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Between the barren pasture and the wood</l>
     <l n="2">There is a patch of poultry-stricken grass ,</l>
     <l n="3">Where , in old time , Ryemeadows ’ Farmhouse stood ,</l>
     <l n="4">And human fate brought tragic things to pass .</l>
     <l n="5">A spring comes bubbling up there , cold as glass ,</l>
     <l n="6">It bubbles down , crusting the leaves with lime ,</l>
     <l n="7">Babbling the self-same song that it has sung through time .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="8">Ducks gobble at the selvage of the brook ,</l>
     <l n="9">But still it slips away , the cold hill-spring ,</l>
     <l n="10">Past the Ryemeadows ’ lonely woodland nook</l>
     <l n="11">Where many a stubble gray-goose preens her wing ,</l>
     <l n="12">On , by the woodland side . You hear it sing</l>
     <l n="13">Past the lone copse where poachers set their wires ,</l>
     <l n="14">Past the green hill once grim with sacrificial fires .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="15">Another water joins it ; then it turns ,</l>
     <l n="16">Runs through the Ponton Wood , still turning west ,</l>
     <l n="17">Past foxgloves , Canterbury bells , and ferns ,</l>
     <l n="18">And many a blackbird 's , many a thrush 's nest ;</l>
     <l n="19">The cattle tread it there ; then , with a zest</l>
     <l n="20">It sparkles out , babbling its pretty chatter</l>
     <l n="21">Through Foxholes Farm , where it gives white-faced cattle water .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="22">Under the road it runs , and now it slips</l>
     <l n="23">Past the great ploughland , babbling , drop and linn ,</l>
     <l n="24">To the moss 'd stumps of elm trees which it lips ,</l>
     <l n="25">And blackberry-bramble-trails where eddies spin .</l>
     <l n="26">Then , on its left , some short-grassed fields begin ,</l>
     <l n="27">Red-clayed and pleasant , which the young spring fills</l>
     <l n="28">With the never-quiet joy of dancing daffodils .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="29">There are three fields where daffodils are found ;</l>
     <l n="30">The grass is dotted blue-gray with their leaves ;</l>
     <l n="31">Their nodding beauty shakes along the ground</l>
     <l n="32">Up to a fir-clump shutting out the eaves</l>
     <l n="33">Of an old farm where always the wind grieves</l>
     <l n="34">High in the fir boughs , moaning ; people call</l>
     <l n="35">This farm The Roughs , but some call it the Poor Maid 's Hall .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="36">There , when the first green shoots of tender corn</l>
     <l n="37">Show on the plough ; when the first drift of white</l>
     <l n="38">Stars the black branches of the spiky thorn ,</l>
     <l n="39">And afternoons are warm and evenings light ,</l>
     <l n="40">The shivering daffodils do take delight ,</l>
     <l n="41">Shaking beside the brook , and grass comes green ,</l>
     <l n="42">And blue dog-violets come and glistening celandine .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="43">And there the pickers come , picking for town</l>
     <l n="44">Those dancing daffodils ; all day they pick ;</l>
     <l n="45">Hard-featured women , weather-beaten brown ,</l>
     <l n="46">Or swarthy-red , the colour of old brick .</l>
     <l n="47">At noon they break their meats under the rick .</l>
     <l n="48">The smoke of all three farms lifts blue in air</l>
     <l n="49">As though man 's passionate mind had never suffered there .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="50">And sometimes as they rest an old man comes ,</l>
     <l n="51">Shepherd or carter , to the hedgerow-side ,</l>
     <l n="52">And looks upon their gangrel tribe , and hums ,</l>
     <l n="53">And thinks all gone to wreck since master died ;</l>
     <l n="54">And sighs over a passionate harvest-tide</l>
     <l n="55">Which Death 's red sickle reaped under those hills ,</l>
     <l n="56">There , in the quiet fields among the daffodils .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="57">When this most tragic fate had time and place ,</l>
     <l n="58">And human hearts and minds to show it by ,</l>
     <l n="59">Ryemeadows ’ Farmhouse was in evil case :</l>
     <l n="60">Its master , Nicholas Gray , was like to die .</l>
     <l n="61">He lay in bed , watching the windy sky ,</l>
     <l n="62">Where all the rooks were homing on slow wings ,</l>
     <l n="63">Cawing , or blackly circling in enormous rings .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="64">With a sick brain he watched them ; then he took</l>
     <l n="65">Paper and pen , and wrote in straggling hand</l>
     <l n="66">( Like spider 's legs , so much his fingers shook )</l>
     <l n="67">Word to the friends who held the adjoining land ,</l>
     <l n="68">Bidding them come ; no more he could command</l>
     <l n="69">His fingers twitching to the feebling blood ;</l>
     <l n="70">He watched his last day 's sun dip down behind the wood ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="71">While all his life 's thoughts surged about his brain :</l>
     <l n="72">Memories and pictures clear , and faces known —</l>
     <l n="73">Long dead , perhaps ; he was a child again ,</l>
     <l n="74">Treading a threshold in the dark alone .</l>
     <l n="75">Then back the present surged , making him moan .</l>
     <l n="76">He asked if Keir had come yet . “ No , ” they said .</l>
     <l n="77">“ Nor Occleve ? ” “ No . ” He moaned : “ Come soon or I 'll be dead . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="78">The names like live things wandered in his mind :</l>
     <l n="79">“ Charles Occleve of The Roughs , ” and “ Rowland Keir —</l>
     <l n="80">Keir of the Foxholes ” ; but his brain was blind ,</l>
     <l n="81">A blind old alley in the storm of the year ,</l>
     <l n="82">Baffling the traveller life with “ No way here , ”</l>
     <l n="83">For all his lantern raised ; life would not tread</l>
     <l n="84">Within that brain again , along those pathways red .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="85">Soon all was dimmed but in the heaven one star .</l>
     <l n="86">“ I 'll hold to that , ” he said ; then footsteps stirred .</l>
     <l n="87">Down in the court a voice said , “ Here they are , ”</l>
     <l n="88">And one , “ He 's almost gone . ” The sick man heard .</l>
     <l n="89">“ Oh God , be quick , ” he moaned . “ Only one word .</l>
     <l n="90">Keir ! Occleve ! Let them come . Why do n't they come ?</l>
     <l n="91">Why stop to tell them that ?— the devil strike you dumb .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="92">“ I 'm neither doll nor dead ; come in , come in .</l>
     <l n="93">Curse you , you women , quick , ” the sick man flamed .</l>
     <l n="94">“ I shall be dead before I can begin .</l>
     <l n="95">A sick man 's womaned-mad , and nursed and damed . ”</l>
     <l n="96">Death had him by the throat ; his wrath was tamed .</l>
     <l n="97">“ Come in , ” he fumed ; “ stop muttering at the door . ”</l>
     <l n="98">The friends came in ; a creaking ran across the floor .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="99">“ Now , Nick , how goes it , man ? ” said Occleve . “ Oh , ”</l>
     <l n="100">The dying man replied , “ I am dying ; past ;</l>
     <l n="101">Mercy of God , I die , I 'm going to go .</l>
     <l n="102">But I have much to tell you if I last .</l>
     <l n="103">Come near me , Occleve , Keir . I am sinking fast ,</l>
     <l n="104">And all my kin are coming ; there , look there .</l>
     <l n="105">All the old , long dead Grays are moving in the air .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="106">“ It is my Michael that I called you for :</l>
     <l n="107">My son , abroad , at school still , over sea .</l>
     <l n="108">See if that hag is listening at the door .</l>
     <l n="109">No ? Shut the door ; do n't lock it , let it be .</l>
     <l n="110">No faith is kept to dying men like me .</l>
     <l n="111">I am dipped deep and dying , bankrupt , done ;</l>
     <l n="112">I leave not even a farthing to my lovely son .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="113">“ Neighbours , these many years our children played ,</l>
     <l n="114">Down in the fields together , down the brook ;</l>
     <l n="115">Your Mary , Keir , the girl , the bonny maid ,</l>
     <l n="116">And Occleve 's Lion , always at his book ;</l>
     <l n="117">Them and my Michael : dear , what joy they took</l>
     <l n="118">Picking the daffodils ; such friends they 've been —</l>
     <l n="119">My boy and Occleve 's boy and Mary Keir for queen .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="120">“ I had made plans ; but I am done with , I .</l>
     <l n="121">Give me the wine . I have to ask you this :</l>
     <l n="122">I can leave Michael nothing , and I die .</l>
     <l n="123">By all our friendship used to be and is ,</l>
     <l n="124">Help him , old friends . Do n't let my Michael miss</l>
     <l n="125">The schooling I 've begun . Give him his chance .</l>
     <l n="126">He does not know I am ill ; I kept him there in France .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="19">
     <l n="127">“ Saving expense ; each penny counts . Oh , friends ,</l>
     <l n="128">Help him another year ; help him to take</l>
     <l n="129">His full diploma when the training ends ,</l>
     <l n="130">So that my ruin wo n't be his . Oh , make</l>
     <l n="131">This sacrifice for our old friendship 's sake ,</l>
     <l n="132">And God will pay you ; for I see God 's hand</l>
     <l n="133">Pass in most marvellous ways on souls : I understand</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="20">
     <l n="134">“ How just rewards are given for man 's deeds</l>
     <l n="135">And judgment strikes the soul . The wine there , wine .</l>
     <l n="136">Life is the daily thing man never heeds .</l>
     <l n="137">It is ablaze with sign and countersign .</l>
     <l n="138">Michael will not forget : that son of mine</l>
     <l n="139">Is a rare son , my friends ; he will go far .</l>
     <l n="140">I shall behold his course from where the blessed are . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="21">
     <l n="141">“ Why , Nick , ” said Occleve , “ come , man . Gather hold .</l>
     <l n="142">Rouse up . You 've given way . If times are bad ,</l>
     <l n="143">Times must be bettering , master ; so be bold ;</l>
     <l n="144">Lift up your spirit , Nicholas , and be glad .</l>
     <l n="145">Michael 's as much to me as my dear lad .</l>
     <l n="146">I 'll see he takes his school . ” “ And I , ” said Keir .</l>
     <l n="147">“ Set you no keep by that , but be at rest , my dear .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="22">
     <l n="148">“ We 'll see your Michael started on the road . ”</l>
     <l n="149">“ But there , ” said Occleve , “ Nick 's not going to die .</l>
     <l n="150">Out of the ruts , good nag , now ; zook the load .</l>
     <l n="151">Pull up , man . Death ! Death and the fiend defy .</l>
     <l n="152">We 'll bring the farm round for you , Keir and I .</l>
     <l n="153">Put heart at rest and get your health . ” “ Ah , no , ”</l>
     <l n="154">The sick man faintly answered , “ I have got to go . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="23">
     <l n="155">Still troubled in his mind , the sick man tossed .</l>
     <l n="156">“ Old friends , ” he said , “ I once had hoped to see</l>
     <l n="157">Mary and Michael wed , but fates are crossed ,</l>
     <l n="158">And Michael starts with nothing left by me .</l>
     <l n="159">Still , if he loves her , will you let it be ?</l>
     <l n="160">So in the grave , maybe , when I am gone ,</l>
     <l n="161">I 'll know my hope fulfilled , and see the plan go on . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="24">
     <l n="162">“ I judge by hearts , not money , ” answered Keir .</l>
     <l n="163">“ If Michael suits in that and suits my maid ,</l>
     <l n="164">I promise you , let Occleve witness here</l>
     <l n="165">He shall be free for me to drive his trade .</l>
     <l n="166">Free , ay , and welcome , too . Be not afraid ,</l>
     <l n="167">I 'll stand by Michael as I hope some friend</l>
     <l n="168">Will stand beside my girl in case my own life end . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="25">
     <l n="169">“ And I , ” said Occleve ; but the sick man seemed</l>
     <l n="170">Still ill at ease . “ My friends , ” he said , “ my friends ,</l>
     <l n="171">Michael may come to all that I have dreamed ,</l>
     <l n="172">But he 's a wild yarn full of broken ends .</l>
     <l n="173">So far his life in France has made amends .</l>
     <l n="174">God grant he steady so ; but girls and drink</l>
     <l n="175">Once brought him near to hell , aye , to the very brink .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="26">
     <l n="176">“ There is a running vein of wildness in him :</l>
     <l n="177">Wildness and looseness both , which vices make</l>
     <l n="178">That woman 's task a hard one who would win him :</l>
     <l n="179">His life depends upon the course you take .</l>
     <l n="180">He is a fiery-mettled colt to break ,</l>
     <l n="181">And one to curb , one to be curbed , remember . ”</l>
     <l n="182">The dying voice died down , the fire left the ember .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="27">
     <l n="183">But once again it flamed . “ Ah me , ” he cried ;</l>
     <l n="184">“ Our secret sins take body in our sons ,</l>
     <l n="185">To haunt our age with what we put aside .</l>
     <l n="186">I was a devil for the women once .</l>
     <l n="187">He is as I was . Beauty like the sun 's ;</l>
     <l n="188">Within , all water ; minded like the moon .</l>
     <l n="189">Go now . I sinned . I die . I shall be punished soon . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="28">
     <l n="190">The two friends tiptoed to the room below .</l>
     <l n="191">There , till the woman came to them , they told</l>
     <l n="192">Of brave adventures in the long ago ,</l>
     <l n="193">Ere Nick and they had thought of growing old ;</l>
     <l n="194">Snipe-shooting in the marshlands in the cold ,</l>
     <l n="195">Old soldiering days as yeomen , days at fairs ,</l>
     <l n="196">Days that had sent Nick tired to those self-same chairs .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="29">
     <l n="197">They vowed to pay the schooling for his son .</l>
     <l n="198">They talked of Michael , testing men 's report ,</l>
     <l n="199">How the young student was a lively one ,</l>
     <l n="200">Handsome and passionate both , and fond of sport ,</l>
     <l n="201">Eager for fun , quick-witted in retort .</l>
     <l n="202">The girls ’ hearts quick to see him cocking by ,</l>
     <l n="203">Young April on a blood horse , with a roving eye .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="30">
     <l n="204">And , as they talked about the lad , Keir asked</l>
     <l n="205">If Occleve 's son had not , at one time , been</l>
     <l n="206">Heartsick for Mary , though with passion masked .</l>
     <l n="207">“ Ay , ” Occleve said : “ Time was . At seventeen .</l>
     <l n="208">It took him hard , it ran his ribs all lean ,</l>
     <l n="209">All of a summer ; but it passed , it died .</l>
     <l n="210">Her fancying Michael better touched my Lion 's pride . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="31">
     <l n="211">Mice flickered from the wainscot to the press ,</l>
     <l n="212">Nibbling at crumbs , rattling to shelter , squeaking .</l>

The improbable has been accomplished by Mr. Masefield ; he has made poetry out of the very material that has refused to yield it for almost a score of years . It has only yielded it with a passion of Keats , and shaped it with the imagination of Coleridge . ” — Boston Evening Transcript .</p>
