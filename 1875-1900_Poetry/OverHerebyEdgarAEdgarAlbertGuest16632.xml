     <p>I do n't know what they 'll put him at , or what his post may be ; I cannot guess the task that waits for him across the sea , But I have known him through the years , and when there 's work to do , I know he 'll meet his duty well , I 'll swear that he 'll be true .</p>
     <p>I sometimes fear that he may die , but never that he 'll shirk ; If death shall want him death must go and take him at his work ; This splendid sacrifice he makes is filled with terrors grim , And I have many thoughts of fear , but not one fear of him .</p>

      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>“ You 've heard a good deal of the telephone wires , ” he said as we sat at our ease , And talked of the struggle that 's taking men 's lives in these terrible days o'er the seas , “ But I 've been through the thick of the thing and I know when a battle 's begun , It is n't the phone you depend on for help . It 's the legs of a boy who can run .</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">“ It is n't because of the phone that I 'm here .</l>
       <l n="2">To-day you are talking to me</l>
       <l n="3">Because of the grit and the pluck of a boy . His</l>
       <l n="4">title was Runner McGee .</l>
       <l n="5">We were up to our dead line an ’ fighting alone ;</l>
       <l n="6">some plan had miscarried , I guess ,</l>
       <l n="7">And the help we were promised had failed to</l>
       <l n="8">arrive . We were showing all signs of</l>
       <l n="9">distress .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>“ Our curtain of fire was ahead of us still , an ’ theirs was behind us an ’ thick , An ’ there was n't a thing we could do for ourselves — the few of us left had to stick . You have n't much chance to get central an ’ talk on the phone to the music of guns ; Gettin ’ word to the chief is a matter right then that is up to the fellow who runs .</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">“ I 'd sent four of ‘ em back with the R. I. P .</l>
       <l n="2">sign , which means to return if you can ,</l>
       <l n="3">But none of ‘ em got through the curtain of fire ;</l>
       <l n="4">my hurry call died with the man .</l>
       <l n="5">Then Runner McGee said he 'd try to get through .</l>
       <l n="6">I hated to order the kid</l>
       <l n="7">On his mission of death ; thought he 'd never get</l>
       <l n="8">by , but somehow or other he did .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>“ Yes , he 's dead . Died an hour after bringing us word that the chief was aware of our plight , An ’ for us to hang on to the ditch that we held ; the reserves would relieve us at night . Then we stuck to our trench an ’ we stuck to our guns ; you know how you 'll fight when you know That new strength is coming to fill up the gaps . There 's heart in the force of your blow .</p>
     <p>“ It was n't till later I got all the facts . They wanted McGee to remain . They begged him to stay . He had cheated death once an ’ was foolish to try it again . ‘ R. I. P. are my orders , ’ he answered them all , ‘ an ’ back to the boys I must go ; Four of us died comin ’ out with the news . It will help them to know that you know . ’ ”</p>
     <p>The Girl He Left Behind</p>
     <p>We used to think her frivolous — you know how parents are , A little quick to see the faults and petty flaws that mar The girl their son is fond of and may choose to make his wife , A little overjealous of the one who 'd share his life ; But the girl he left behind him when he bravely marched away Has blossomed into beauty that we see and need to-day .</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">She was with us at the depot , and we turned our</l>
       <l n="2">backs a-while ,</l>
       <l n="3">And her eyes were sad and misty , though she</l>
       <l n="4">tried her best to smile .</l>
       <l n="5">Then she put her arm round mother , and it</l>
       <l n="6">seemed to me as though</l>
       <l n="7">They just grew to love each other , for they</l>
       <l n="8">shared a common woe .</l>
       <l n="9">Now she often comes to see us , and it seems</l>
       <l n="10">to me we find</l>
       <l n="11">A heap of solid comfort in the girl he left behind .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>“ She 's so sensible and gentle , ” mother said last night to me , “ The kind of girl I 've often wished and prayed his wife would be . And I like to have her near us , for she understands my sighs And I see my brave boy smiling when I look into her eyes . ” Now the presence of his sweetheart seems to fill our home with joy . She 's no longer young and flighty — she 's the girl who loves our boy .</p>

       <l n="11">That filled it with the joys he craved now serve in foreign lands .</l>

       <l n="16">And all that night he 'll live again the joys that once he had</l>
       <l n="17">When he was good St. Nicholas unto a certain lad .</l>

     <p>You find us a people united , full pledged to the work of the world , To banish the despot and tyrant , our banner in battle 's unfurled ; And here to a world that is bleeding and weary and heartsick you come , Whatever you 've brought us of duty — we 'll answer the call of your drum .</p>
     <p>We may weep in our grief and our sorrows , we may bend ‘ neath the might of the blow , But never our courage shall falter , and never we 'll run from the foe . We know not how troubled our pathways shall be nor how sorely beset , But I pray we shall cling to our honor as men and never our purpose forget .</p>

       <l n="1">Warriors</l>
     </lg>
     <p>We all are warriors with sin . Crusading knights , we come to earth With spotless plumes and shining shields to joust with foes and prove our worth . The world is but a battlefield where strong and weak men fill the lists , And some make war with humble prayers , and some with swords and some with fists . And some for pleasure or for peace forsake their purposes and goals And barter for the scarlet joys of ease and pomp , their knightly souls .</p>
     <p>We 're all enlisted soldiers here , in service for the term called life And each of us in some grim way must bear his portion of the strife . Temptations everywhere assail . Men do not rise by fearing sin , Nor he who keeps within his tent , unharmed , unscratched , the crown shall win . When wrongs are trampling mortals down and rank injustice stalks about , Real manhood to the battle flies , and dies or puts the foes to rout .</p>
     <p>‘ Tis not the new and shining blade that marks the soldier of the field , His glory is his broken sword , his pride the scars upon his shield ; The crimson stains that sin has left upon his soul are tongues that speak The victory of new found strength by one who yesterday was weak . And meaningless the spotless plume , the shining blade that goes through life And quits this naming battlefield without one evidence of strife .</p>
     <p>We all are warriors with sin , we all are knights in life 's crusades , And with some form of tyranny , we 're sent to earth to measure blades . The courage of the soul must gleam in conflict with some fearful foe , No man was ever born to life its luxuries alone to know . And he who brothers with a sin to keep his outward garb unsoiled And fears to battle with a wrong , shall find his soul decayed and spoiled .</p>

     </lg>
     <p>“ My Crown Prince was fine and fair , ” a sorrowful father said , “ But he marched away with his regiment and they tell me that he 's dead ! ‘ We all must go , ’ he whispered low , ‘ We must fight for the Fatherland . ’ Now the heart of me 's torn with the grief I know , and I cannot understand , For none of the Kaiser 's princes lie out there where my soldier sleeps ; Here 's a land where grief is the common lot , but never the Kaiser weeps .</p>
     <p>“ My Crown Prince was a kindly prince , and his eyes were gentle , too , And glad were the days of his youth to me when his wonderful smile I knew . Then the Kaiser flattered and spoke him well , and he sent him out to die , But his Crown Prince has n't felt one hurt and the heart of me questions why ? He talks of war in his regal way and he boasts of his strength to strike , But his boys all live and he does n't know what the sting of a bullet 's like .</p>
     <p>“ Rebellion gnaws at the soul of me as I think of his Crown Prince gay , And my Prince cold in the arms of death , and harsh are the things I say . I join with the grief-torn muttering men who challenge the Kaiser 's right To build his joys on the graves of ours . We shall rise in our wrath to smite ! And this is the thing we shall ask of him : to give us the reason why Our boys must fall on his battlefields , but never his boys must die ? ”</p>
