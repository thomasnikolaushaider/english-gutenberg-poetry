    <head>INTRODUCTION</head>
    <p n="1">A poet that comes through a unique experience , as so many poets have , and very recently as the author of this volume has , arrives through his personality rather than his work at a precipitate sort of fame that may serve his talents well or serve them ill. To know that a man was sent to jail as the consequence of a passionate desire to go to college , and that that desire involved the tramping of dusty and hungry miles , adds to the interest to the man that cannot fail in some significant way to set a glamor upon the poet . Poetry is made out of experience — the experience of dreams , of action , of desires and hopes baffled on the inexplicable sea of circumstance ; in these latter the dream is as the spirit , and the man whose art becomes an expression of all he has realized in living , his experiences become something more than art , they are the subtle rendering reality that is truth .</p>
    <p n="2">In these poems of Mr. Jones ’ it is that which gives them a unique value because they are in a deeply essential manner the rendering of a human document , as all poems must be , of an individual who speaks universally . I emphasize this quality first because art registers its worth by the vitality of its substance . If the substance be vital , then its embodiment is artistically successful to the degree in which the maker has felt his experiences . These poems , then , will come to many readers with a freshness , with the appeal for a certain sympathy that will compel attention . The opening poem which celebrates the centenary of Lincoln 's birth , with its fine imaginative sweep , is as good as any poem I have seen which that occasion called forth . In it is poetry that ought to assure Mr. Jones ’ future if circumstances permit him to cultivate an art for which nature has so obviously endowed him . “ The Sylvan Cabin ” in spirit may be said to characterize the author 's book ; that upward striving toward the ideal , which taking a personal expression in his own experience , in his own hopes , has also a larger significance in voicing the aspirations of those for whom , as is shown in many other poems , he becomes a voice , a representative .</p>
    <p n="3">Mr. Jones ’ work has already won for him the approbation of many literary people , his poems having appeared from time to time in various publications ; this fact not only justifies his gathering them together in this volume , but being so recognized must fill him with a certain assurance for the future . To this I can only add that , good as these are , they give us the hope for better from one who ought certainly to go on and upward .</p>

       <l n="3">Embrace thee softly and to kiss</l>
       <l n="4">Thy lovely , long-forsaken cheeks ;</l>
       <l n="5">To smooth thy flowing silver locks</l>
       <l n="6">And bind about thy snowy neck</l>
       <l n="7">A necklace golden studded full</l>
       <l n="8">With rarest gems and shining pearls .</l>
       <l n="9">Our eyes , though sometimes dimmed with tears ,</l>
       <l n="10">In purer lustre sparkle forth</l>
       <l n="11">Whene'er they fall agaze on thee !</l>
       <l n="12">Our ears attuned to thy sweet lay</l>
       <l n="13">Catch every flowing , cadent note</l>
       <l n="14">And bear it ever safe within</l>
       <l n="15">Our rapturous hearts , which gladly leap</l>
       <l n="16">Whene'er thy name is called !</l>
       <l n="17">Deep in our souls the quenchless fire</l>
       <l n="18">Of love full brightly burns upon</l>
       <l n="19">The sacred altar , set apart</l>
       <l n="20">For sprite commune and sacrifice ;</l>
       <l n="21">Whose high-priest tends with loving care ,</l>
       <l n="22">And unto thee sweet incense burns .</l>
       <l n="23">Our tongues most gladly sing thy praise ,</l>
       <l n="24">And from it ne'er shall cease — till all</l>

        <l n="26">A century lonely hast thou stood</l>
        <l n="27">Here all forsaken and forgot !</l>
        <l n="28">All men failed thee to visit save</l>
        <l n="29">Some idle lover of sylvan haunts</l>
        <l n="30">Who trod , perchance , this hallowed spot ,</l>
        <l n="31">And cast a pensive eye upon</l>
        <l n="32">This lovely glade , thy sole abode</l>
        <l n="33">( Full lost in these continuous woods ) ,</l>
        <l n="34">And brooding o'er thy lowly lot ,</l>
        <l n="35">Oft thus did muse : “ This cabin lone</l>
        <l n="36">Here stands to tell the tale of him ,</l>
        <l n="37">Back-woodsman brave , who having scaled</l>
        <l n="38">The mystic mountains ne'er returned</l>
        <l n="39">To them , though loved yet left behind ;</l>
        <l n="40">But here he chose his last abode ,</l>
        <l n="41">These gloomy woods whose blackness stands</l>
        <l n="42">Up hard against horizon 's slope ;</l>
        <l n="43">Grim , spectral , dreaded , and untrod</l>
        <l n="44">Save monsters great of savage mien ,</l>
        <l n="45">That prowled , or crouched upon their prey ;</l>
        <l n="46">Sent forth a vicious roar that fairly shook</l>
        <l n="47">Old Sylvia far and near , from vale</l>
        <l n="48">Through crag to mountain peak !</l>
        <l n="49">Upon this spot the redskin oft</l>
        <l n="50">Has danced his ‘ War dance ’ and his ‘ Feast , ’</l>
        <l n="51">His face a reddish hue aglow —</l>
        <l n="52">Long locks with eaglets ’ plumes bedecked ;</l>
        <l n="53">His bow and never-failing dart ,</l>
        <l n="54">And scalper dangling at his side .</l>
        <l n="55">More brightly gleamed his wary eye ,</l>
        <l n="56">As braves the war-whoop loudly yelled —</l>
        <l n="57">A sight more like the fiery fiends</l>
        <l n="58">From Pluto 's ghastly shore returned</l>
        <l n="59">Than human blood and bone !</l>
        <l n="60">They all have gone and left no tale</l>
        <l n="61">But woe which hurled them ever hence</l>
        <l n="62">To that shore whence no bark returns .</l>
        <l n="63">Old Cabin , thou , a land-mark art ,</l>

      <head>LULA JOHNSON 'S SONG</head>
      <head>Written in Quinn Chapel , A. M. E. Church , Ninth and Walnut Streets , Louisville , Ky ., Wednesday evening , October 16th , 1907 , while Miss Lula E. Johnson was singing “ Ave Maria . ”</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">I have heard the mock-bird singing when the orchards were in bloom ,</l>
       <l n="2">And the sweetness of his music made the peacock don his plume ;</l>
       <l n="3">Ay ! I 've heard cock-robin-redbreast chirping on a sunny day ,</l>
       <l n="4">And the skylark soaring skywards , merrily sing his festal lay ;</l>
       <l n="5">And the brown thrush and the bluebird thrill their little treble notes ;</l>
       <l n="6">All the woodland songsters pouring songs of gladness from their throats —</l>
       <l n="7">But not one has touched so deeply , and not one has last so long</l>

       <l n="9">When the breeze has ceased to whisper and the night is soft and still ,</l>
       <l n="10">Save the awe-provoking shrilling of the ghastly whippoorwill ,</l>
       <l n="11">As the moonbeams pour down brightly on the woodland , hill and dale ,</l>
       <l n="12">I oft listen at my window to the queenly nightingale ;</l>
       <l n="13">But no song of merry woodland , neither hill , nor dale , nor dell ,</l>
       <l n="14">Has ever smote my bosom , nor has made my spirit swell ,</l>
       <l n="15">Like the soul-inspiring music that so softly glides along</l>
       <l n="16">Oh ! so softly and so gently in sweet Lula Johnson 's song !</l>

       <l n="27">And I hope when dawns the morning , when I draw my fleeting breath ,</l>

      <head>AN ODE TO ETHIOPIA</head>

      <head>After years of patient study and historical research , I have made the following deductions of parts played by the Ethiopian in the annals of history , under the caption , “ An Ode to Ethiopia . ” It is true that questions will rise regarding the racial identity of some of my characters , in view of historical statements which place them with the Caucasian race ; yet I firmly believe , were impartial history written , my claims would be justified .

     <head>O GOD , WILT THOU HELP ME IN SCHOOL ?</head>
     <p>On Saturday , March 1 , 1902 , I left Alcorn and went home in order to earn money enough to defray my expenses for the year 1902-03 . I began work as soon as I reached home and labored on father 's farm until the last week in June , 1902 . I had seen by that time that there was nothing to be realized from that source but disheartening failure .</p>
     <p>I then acted as agent for the “ Zion Record , ” published by Rev . R. A. Adams , 39 St. Catherine Street , Natchez , Miss ., until August 20 , 1902 . Knowing that there was a dormitory to be built for girls at Alcorn , I went there , hoping to get work and to be there when school opened . On arriving , I failed to get employment . I had no money . The Boarding Hall was run by boys who stayed over summer . Finding I was unemployed , they refused to let me take meals with them . There I was — friendless and penniless — without a bite of bread and nowhere to lay my head . To drive the wolf of starvation away and to keep from being devoured , I made arrangements with President Lanier to cut wood for something to eat , until school opened Sept. 2 , 1902 .</p>
     <p>When school opened , the Faculty met the first day and distributed the positions to the eligibles . On going down to the Hall to take my first meal , to my surprise I found I had been awarded the position of waiter . To hold a position , or even remain on the Campus , one must matriculate within three days after school starts , if there when it opens , or after he arrives , if not . I then wrote home for the matriculation fee ($ 13 ) , as I had labored there all summer . As that letter was sealed my destiny was sealed in it . It was one that hauled my anchor of hope ; yes , one to bring glad tidings of great joy and crowning success , or the gloom of disastrous failure . Thus , having my hope sealed , I wrote across it “ In Haste ! ”</p>
     <p>The night of its return was a dark , rainy one . As all sat discussing different events that had transpired since the new session had begun , suddenly a whistle was heard . How our hearts throbbed with gladness as we exclaimed , “ There , that 's the mail ! ” Dear reader , you cannot imagine how overjoyed I was . I knew that bag contained a letter for me ; so anxious was I to receive it I did not trust anyone , but rushed to the office , and ere long my name was called .</p>
     <p>I opened it then and there , with an eager look for a green piece of paper styled a “ Money Order . ” I looked , but found it not . All hope vanished ; joy faded ; and gloom hovered over me — a feeling I never before had , nor since , and I hope never again to have , electrified my body . It was then raining at full headway : the lightnings flashed ; the thunders pealed out peal after peal , each succeeding one louder than the first . By this time all had gone to bed but me . I thought thought after thought , prayed prayer after prayer , sent up cry after cry , shed tear after tear . I went to bed , but could not sleep . I then thought of this subject : “ O God , Wilt Thou Help Me in School ? ” After writing it , my feelings were changed , the gloom was dispelled , and ‘ Smiling Hope ’ returned with joyous tidings of happiness and a blissful future .</p>
