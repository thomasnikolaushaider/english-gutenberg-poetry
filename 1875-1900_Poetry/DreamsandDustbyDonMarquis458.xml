     <l n="14">Is laid upon the quivering hills until ,</l>
     <l n="15">Like Egypt 's Memnon , they grow quick with song .</l>
     <l n="16">This is another day , and the bold world</l>

     <l n="22">Let dust clasp dust ; death , death — I am alive !</l>
     <l n="23">And out of all the dust and death of mine</l>
     <l n="24">Old selves I dare to lift a singing heart</l>
     <l n="25">And living faith ; my spirit dares drink deep</l>
     <l n="26">Of the red mirth mantling in the cup of morn .</l>

     <l n="10">And dropped upon the breathing hills</l>
     <l n="11">A sudden music</l>

   <p>WITH THE SUBMARINES</p>
   <p>ABOVE , the baffled twilight fails ; beneath , the blind snakes creep ; Beside us glides the charnel shark , our pilot through the deep ; And , lurking where low headlands shield from cruising scout and spy , We bide the signal through the gloom that bids us slay or die .</p>
   <p>All watchful , mute , the crouching guns that guard the strait sea lanes — Watchful and hawklike , plumed with hate , the desperate aeroplanes — And still as death and swift as fate , above the darkling coasts , The spying Wireless sows the night with troops of stealthy ghosts ,</p>
   <p>While hushed through all her huddled streets the tide-walled city waits The drumming thunders that announce brute battle at her gates .</p>
   <p>Southward a hundred windy leagues , through storms that blind and bar , Our cheated cruisers search the waves , our captains seek the war ; But here the port of peril is ; the foeman 's dreadnoughts ride Sullen and black against the moon , upon a sullen tide . And only we to launch ourselves against their stark advance — To guide uncertain lightnings through these treacherous seas of chance !</p>
   <p>. . . . . .</p>
   <p>And now a wheeling searchlight paints a signal on the night ; And now the bellowing guns are loud with the wild lust of fight .</p>
   <p>. . . . . .</p>
   <p>And now , her flanks of steel apulse with all the power of hell , Forth from the darkness leaps in pride a hateful miracle , The flagship of their Admiral — and now God help and save !— We challenge Death at Death 's own game ; we sink beneath the wave !</p>
   <p>. . . . . .</p>

     <l n="1">Ah , steady now — and one good blow — one straight</l>
     <l n="2">stab through the gloom —</l>

     <l n="4">flounders to her doom !—</l>
     <l n="5">Full speed ahead !— those damned quick-firing guns</l>

     <l n="1">( 1914 )</l>
   </lg>
   <p>THE great guns slay from a league away , the death-bolts fly unseen , And bellowing hill replies to hill , machine to brute machine , But still in the end when the long lines bend and the battle hangs in doubt They take to the steel in the same old way that their fathers fought it out — It is man to man and breast to breast and eye to bloodshot eye And the reach and twist of the thrusting wrist , as it was in the days gone by !</p>
   <p>Along the shaken hills the guns their drumming thunder roll — But the keen blades thrill with the lust to kill that leaps from the slayer 's soul !</p>
   <p>For hand and heart and living steel , one pulse of hate they feel . Is your clan afraid of the naked blade ? Does it flinch from the bitter steel ? Perish your dreams of conquest then , your swollen hopes and bold , For empire dwells with the stabbing blade , as it did in the days of old !</p>

   <p>A RHYME OF THE ROADS</p>
   <p>PEARL-SLASHED and purple and crimson and fringed with gray mist of the hills , The pennons of morning advance to the music of rock-fretted rills , The dumb forest quickens to song , and the little gusts shout as they fling A floor-cloth of orchard bloom down for the flashing , quick feet of the Spring .</p>
   <p>To the road , gipsy-heart , thou and I ! ‘ Tis the mad piper , Spring , who is leading ; ‘ Tis the pulse of his piping that throbs through the brain , irresistibly pleading ; Full-blossomed , deep-bosomed , fain woman , light-footed , lute-throated and fleet , We have drunk of the wine of this Wanderer 's song ; let us follow his feet !</p>
   <p>Like raveled red girdles flung down by some hoidenish goddess in mirth The tangled roads reach from rim unto utter-most rim of the earth — We will weave of these strands a strong net , we will snare the bright wings of delight ,— We will make of these strings a sweet lute that will shame the low wind-harps of night .</p>
   <p>The clamor of tongues and the clangor of trades in the peevish packed street , The arrogant , jangling Nothings , with iterant , dissonant beat , The clattering , senseless endeavor with dross of mere gold for its goal , These have sickened the senses and wearied the brain and straitened the soul .</p>
   <p>“ Come forth and be cleansed of the folly of strife for things worthless of strife , Come forth and gain life and grasp God by foregoing gains worthless of life ” —</p>
   <p>It was thus spake the wizard wildwood , low-voiced to the hearkening heart , It was thus sang the jovial hills , and the harper sun bore part .</p>
   <p>O woman , whose blood as my blood with the fire of the Spring is aflame , We did well , when the red roads called , that we heeded the call and came — Came forth to the sweet wise silence where soul may speak sooth unto soul , Vine-wreathed and vagabond Love , with the goal of Nowhere for our goal !</p>
   <p>What planet-crowned Dusk that wanders the steeps of our firmament there Hath gems that may match with the dew-opals meshed in thine opulent hair ? What wind-witch that skims the curled billows with feet they are fain to caress Hath sandals so wing 'd as thine art with a god-like carelessness ?</p>
   <p>And dare we not dream this is heaven ?— to wander thus on , ever on . Through the hush-heavy valleys of space , up the flushing red slopes of the dawn ?— For none that seeks rest shall find rest till he ceaseth his striving for rest , And the gain of the quest is the joy of the road that allures to the quest .</p>

    <head>THE NOBLER LESSON</head>
     <l n="1">CHRIST was of virgin birth , and , being slain ,</l>
     <l n="2">The creedists say , He rose from death again .</l>
     <l n="3">Oh , futile age-long talk of death and birth !—</l>
     <l n="4">His life , that is the one thing wonder-worth ;</l>
     <l n="5">Not how He came , but how He lived on earth .</l>
     <l n="6">For if gods stoop , and with quaint jugglery</l>
     <l n="7">Mock nature 's laws , how shall that profit thee ?—</l>
     <l n="8">The nobler lesson is that mortals can</l>
     <l n="9">Grow godlike through this baffled front of man !</l>

    <head>AT LAST</head>
    <head>EACH race has died and lived and fought for the “ true ” gods of that poor race , Unconsciously , divinest thought of each race gilding its god 's face . And every race that lives and dies shall make itself some other gods , Shall build , with mingled truth and lies , new icons from the world-old clods . Through all the tangled creeds and dreams and shifting shibboleths men hold The false-and-true , inwoven , gleams : a matted mass of dross and gold . Prove , then , thy gods in thine own soul ; all others ’ gods , for thee , are vain ; Nor swerved be , struggling for the goal , by bribe of joy nor threat of pain .</head>

     <l n="4">the backward-gazer 's view .</l>
     <l n="5">Where , where the faiths of yesterday ? Ah ,</l>
     <l n="6">whither vanished , whither gone ?</l>
     <l n="7">Say , what Apollos drive to-day adown the flaming</l>
     <l n="8">slopes of dawn ?</l>
     <l n="9">Oh , does the blank past hide from view forgotten</l>
     <l n="10">Christs , to be reborn ,</l>
     <l n="11">The future tremble where some new Messiah-Memnon</l>
     <l n="12">sings the morn ?</l>
     <l n="13">Of all the worlds , say any earth , like dust</l>
     <l n="14">wind-harried to and fro ,</l>
     <l n="15">Shall give the next Prometheus birth ; but say — at</l>

    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>How should I know what dawn may gleam beyond the gates of darkness there ?— Which god of all the gods men dream ? Why should I whip myself to care ? Whichever over all hath place hath shaped and made me what I am ; Hath made me strong to front his face , to dare to question though he damn .</p>
   <p>Perhaps to cringe and cower and bring a shrine a forced and faithless faith Is far more futile than to fling your laughter in the face of Death . For writhe or whirl in dervish rout , they are not flattered there on high , Or sham belief to hide a doubt — no gods are mine that love a lie ! Nor gods that beg belief on earth with portents that some seer foretells — Is life itself not wonder-worth that we must cry for miracles ? Is it not strange enough we breathe ? Does every - thing not God reveal ? Or must we ever weave and wreathe some creed that shall his face conceal ? Some creed of which its prophets cry it holds the secret 's all-in-all : Some creed which ever bye and bye doth crumble , totter , to its fall ! Say any dream of all the dreams that drift and darkle , glint and glow , Holds most of truth within its gleams ; but say — at last — you do not know .</p>
   <p>Oh , say the soul , from star to star , with victory wing 'd , leap on through space And scale the bastioned nights that bar the secret 's inner dwelling-place ; Or say it ever roam dim glades where pallid wraiths of long-dead moons Flit like blown feathers through the shades , borne on the breath of sobbing tunes : Say any tide of any time , of all the tides that ebb and flow , Shall buoy us on toward any clime ; but say — at last — you do not know !</p>

     <l n="2">For all their golden Summers and green Springs</l>
     <l n="3">Through leaf and root they sucked the forest 's life ,</l>

     <l n="6">Its breathing hushes stirred of faery wings ,</l>
     <l n="7">Its August nights and April noons ;</l>
     <l n="8">The garnered fervors of forgotten Junes</l>
     <l n="9">Flare forth again and waste away ;</l>
     <l n="10">And in the sap that leaps and sings</l>

   <p>REALITIES</p>
   <p>REALITIES</p>
   <p>WE are deceived by the shadow , we see not the substance of things . For the hills are less solid than thought ; and deeds are but vapors ; and flesh Is a mist thrown off and resumed by the soul , as a world by a god . Back of the transient appearance dwells in ineffable calm The utter reality , ultimate truth ; this seems and that is .</p>

    <head>THE STRUGGLE</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">I HAVE been down in a dark valley ;</l>
     <l n="2">I have been groping through a deep gorge ;</l>
     <l n="3">Far above , the lips of it were rimmed with moonlight ,</l>
     <l n="4">And here and there the light lay on the dripping</l>
     <l n="5">rocks</l>
     <l n="6">So that it seemed they dripped with moonlight ,</l>
     <l n="7">not with water ;</l>
     <l n="8">So deep it was , that narrow gash among the hills ,</l>
     <l n="9">That those great pines which fringed its edge</l>
     <l n="10">Seemed to me no larger than upthrust fingers</l>
     <l n="11">Silhouetted against the sky ;</l>
     <l n="12">And at its top the vale was strait ,</l>
     <l n="13">And the rays were slant</l>
     <l n="14">And reached but part way down the sides ;</l>
     <l n="15">I could not see the moon itself ;</l>
     <l n="16">I walked through darkness , and the valley 's edge</l>
     <l n="17">Seemed almost level with the stars ,</l>

     <l n="19">It was the midnight of defeat ;</l>

     <l n="22">There was no way out of that gorge ;</l>
     <l n="23">The paths led no whither</l>
     <l n="24">And I could not remember their beginnings ;</l>

     <l n="28">Groping , with gleams of useless light</l>

     <l n="89">And with a shout I leapt and grasped that Being ,</l>

     <l n="93">Hand seeking throat , and crook 'd knee seeking</l>
     <l n="94">To encrook unwary leg ,</l>
     <l n="95">And spread toes grasping the uneven ground ;</l>
     <l n="96">The strained breast muscles cracked and creaked ,</l>
     <l n="97">The sweat ran in my eyes ,</l>
     <l n="98">The plagued breath sobbed and whistled through</l>
     <l n="99">my throat ,</l>
     <l n="100">I tasted blood , and strangled , but still struggled</l>
     <l n="101">on —</l>
     <l n="102">The stars above me danced in swarms like yellow</l>
     <l n="103">bees ,</l>
     <l n="104">The shaken moonlight writhed upon the rocks ;—</l>
     <l n="105">But at the last I felt his breathing weaker grow ,</l>
     <l n="106">The tense limbs grow less tense ,</l>
     <l n="107">And with a bursting cry I bent his head right</l>
     <l n="108">back ,</l>
     <l n="109">Back , back , until</l>
     <l n="110">I heard his neck bones snap ;</l>
     <l n="111">His spine crunched in my grip ;</l>
     <l n="112">I flung him to the earth and knelt upon his breast</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>And listened till the fluttering pulse was stilled . Man , god , or devil , I had wrenched the life from him !</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">And lo !— even as he died</l>
     <l n="2">The moonlight failed above the vale ,—</l>
     <l n="3">And somehow , sure , I know now how !—</l>
     <l n="4">Between the rifted rocks the great Sun struck</l>
     <l n="5">A finger down the cliff , and that red beam</l>
     <l n="6">Lay sharp across the face of him that I had slain ;</l>
     <l n="7">And in that light I read the answer of the silent</l>
     <l n="8">gods</l>
     <l n="9">Unto my cursed-out prayer ,</l>
     <l n="10">For he that lay upon the ground was — I !</l>
     <l n="11">I understood the lesson then ;</l>
     <l n="12">It was myself that lay there dead ;</l>
     <l n="13">Yes , I had slain my Self .</l>

   <p>THE CHILD AND THE MILL</p>
   <p>BETTER a pauper , penniless , asleep on the kindly sod — Better a gipsy , houseless , but near to the heart of God ,</p>
   <p>That beats for ears not dulled by the clanking wheels of care — Better starvation and freedom , hope and the good fresh air</p>
   <p>Than death to the Something in him that was born to laugh and dream , That was kin to the idle lilies and the ripples of the stream .</p>
   <p>For out of the dreams of childhood , that careless come and go , The boy gains strength , unknowing , that the Man will prove and know .</p>
   <p>But these fools with their lies and their dollars , their mills and their bloody hands , Who make a god of a wheel , who worship their whirring bands ,</p>
   <p>They are flinging the life of a people , raw , to the brute machines . Dull-eyed , weary , and old — old in his early teens —</p>
   <p>Stunted and stupid and twisted , marred in the mills of grief , Can your factories fashion a Man of this thing — a Man and a Chief ?</p>
   <p>Dumb is the heart of him now , at the time when his heart should sing — Wasters of body and brain , what race will the future bring ?</p>
   <p>What of the nation 's nerve whenas swift crises come ? What of the brawn that should heave the guns on the beck of the drum ?</p>
   <p>Thieves of body and soul , who can neither think nor feel , Swine-eyed priests of little false gods of gold and steel ,</p>
   <p>Bow to your obscene altars , worship your loud mills then ! Feed to Moloch and Baal the brawn and brains of men —</p>
   <p>But silent and watchful and hidden forever over all The masters brood of those Mills that “ grind exceeding small . ”</p>
   <p>And it needs no occult art nor magic to foreshow That a people who sow defeat they will reap the thing they sow .</p>

      <l n="59">To battle there with Death ?— to battle</l>
      <l n="60">There with Death , and wrest from him ,</l>

      <l n="65">Unconscious of the sterner throes ,</l>

    <head>A LITTLE WHILE</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">A little while the tears and laughter ,</l>
     <l n="2">The willow and the rose —</l>
     <l n="3">A little while , and what comes after</l>
     <l n="4">No man knows .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">An hour to sing , to love and linger ...</l>
     <l n="6">Then lutanist and lute</l>
     <l n="7">Will fall on silence , song and singer</l>
     <l n="8">Both be mute .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">Our gods from our desires we fashion ....</l>
     <l n="10">Exalt our baffled lives ,</l>
     <l n="11">And dream their vital bloom and passion</l>
     <l n="12">Still survives ;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">But when we 're done with mirth and weeping ,</l>
     <l n="14">With myrtle , rue , and rose ,</l>
     <l n="15">Shall Death take Life into his keeping ? ...</l>
     <l n="16">No man knows .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="17">What heart hath not , through twilight places ,</l>
     <l n="18">Sought for its dead again</l>
     <l n="19">To gild with love their pallid faces ? ...</l>
     <l n="20">Sought in vain ! ...</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="21">Still mounts the Dream on shining pinion ...</l>
     <l n="22">Still broods the dull distrust ...</l>
     <l n="23">Which shall have ultimate dominion ,</l>
     <l n="24">Dream , or dust ?</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="25">A little while with grief and laughter ,</l>
     <l n="26">And then the day will close ;</l>

     <l n="28">No man knows !</l>
