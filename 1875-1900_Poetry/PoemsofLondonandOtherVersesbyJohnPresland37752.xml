   <p>POEMS OF LONDON</p>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>LONDON DAWN</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Dawn over London ; all the pearly light</l>
     <l n="2">Trembles and quivers over street and park ,</l>
     <l n="3">The houses are a strange , unearthly white ;</l>
     <l n="4">Pavement and roof grow slowly , palely bright ;</l>
     <l n="5">There is no shadow , neither light nor dark</l>
     <l n="6">But everything is steeped in glimmering dawn .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="7">Oh , purity of dawn ; oh , milk-and-pearl</l>
     <l n="8">Translucent splendour , spreading far and wide ,</l>
     <l n="9">As on a yellow beach the small waves curl</l>
     <l n="10">— Almost as noiselessly as buds unfurl —</l>
     <l n="11">On windless mornings with the rising tide ,</l>
     <l n="12">So flows the dawn o'er London , all asleep .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="13">Indeed , I think that heaven is a sea ,</l>
     <l n="14">And London is a city of old rhymes</l>
     <l n="15">Sunk fathoms deep in its transparency ,</l>
     <l n="16">That folk of living lands may dream they see</l>
     <l n="17">And muse on , and have thoughts about our times ,</l>
     <l n="18">How we were great and splendid , and now gone .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="19">For never light the common earth has born ,</l>
     <l n="20">This crystalline pale wonder that so falls</l>
     <l n="21">On streets and squares the daily toil has worn ,</l>
     <l n="22">On blind-eyed houses , holding lives forlorn ,</l>
     <l n="23">For the grey roads and wide , blank , grey-brick walls</l>
     <l n="24">Shine with a glory that is new and strange .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="25">And not more wonderful , nor otherwise</l>
     <l n="26">Shall dawn come up upon the dewy hills ,</l>
     <l n="27">Nor in the mountains , where the rivers rise</l>
     <l n="28">That water Eden ; and no lovelier lies</l>
     <l n="29">The dawn on Paradise , than this that fills</l>
     <l n="30">The space ‘ twixt house and house with tremulous light .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="31">Yet , on the pavement , huddled fast asleep ,</l>
     <l n="32">A thing of dusty , ragged misery ,</l>
     <l n="33">Grotesque in wretchedness , from London 's deep</l>
     <l n="34">Spumed off , a strange , distorted thing to creep</l>
     <l n="35">From God knows where , and lie , and let all be</l>
     <l n="36">Unheeding , whether of the day or night .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="37">Such tired , hopeless angles of the knees</l>
     <l n="38">And neck and elbows — and the dawning grey</l>
     <l n="39">Trembling to sunrise ; in the park the trees</l>
     <l n="40">Begin to shiver lightly in a breeze ,</l>
     <l n="41">And turning watchful kindly eyes away</l>
     <l n="42">The policeman passes slowly on his beat .</l>
    </lg>
    <p>SPRING IN OXFORD STREET</p>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="43">A dash of rain on the pavement ,</l>
     <l n="44">In the air a gleam of sun ,</l>
     <l n="45">And the clouds are white , and rolling high</l>
     <l n="46">From Marble Arch all down the sky</l>
     <l n="47">— And that 's the spring begun !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="48">The sky is all a-shining</l>
     <l n="49">With sunniest blue and white ,</l>
     <l n="50">The flags are streaming out full cry</l>
     <l n="51">As the crisp North wind comes bustling by ,</l>
     <l n="52">And all the roofs are bright .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="53">And all the shops and houses</l>
     <l n="54">Of sunlit Oxford Street ,</l>
     <l n="55">— Pearl behind amber , gold by rose —</l>
     <l n="56">To grey the long perspective goes ;</l>
     <l n="57">Till all the houses meet .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="58">And there , in every gutter ,</l>
     <l n="59">The glory of spring flowers</l>
     <l n="60">The whole long street with colour fills ,</l>
     <l n="61">And across the yellow daffodils</l>
     <l n="62">Sharp sunshine and soft showers .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="63">And among the drabs and greys and browns</l>
     <l n="64">Of folk going to and fro</l>
     <l n="65">Are trays of violets , darkly bright ,</l>
     <l n="66">And yellow , like the spring moon 's light ,</l>
     <l n="67">Pale primrose-bunches show .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="68">There 's blue in every puddle ,</l>
     <l n="69">And every pane of glass</l>
     <l n="70">Has a thousand little dancing suns ,</l>
     <l n="71">— And up and down the glad news runs ,</l>
     <l n="72">That spring has come to pass .</l>
    </lg>
    <p>JUDD STREET , ST. PANCRAS</p>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="73">My dwelling has a courtyard wide</l>
     <l n="74">Where lord with lady well might pace ,</l>
     <l n="75">— Such silks and velvets side by side ,</l>
     <l n="76">And she a fan to shield her face !—</l>
     <l n="77">It 's fine as any king 's ;</l>
     <l n="78">For there I see on either hand</l>
     <l n="79">The whole great stretch of London lie ;</l>
     <l n="80">— Just so as any king might stand</l>
     <l n="81">Upon his roof , to watch go by</l>
     <l n="82">The flashing pigeon wings .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="83">Just so a king might look abroad :</l>
     <l n="84">“ And this is all my own , ” says he ,</l>
     <l n="85">And then he 'd turn to some great lord ,</l>
     <l n="86">Who 'd acquiesce with gravity</l>
     <l n="87">— But that I do without ,</l>
     <l n="88">For all of lord there is up here</l>
     <l n="89">Is this impassive chimney-stack ,</l>
     <l n="90">And cloudy be my view or clear</l>
     <l n="91">My courtier will not answer back ;</l>
     <l n="92">All silent I look out ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="93">And see the flight of roofs that fade</l>
     <l n="94">Towards the West in golden haze ,</l>
     <l n="95">And all this work men 's hands have made</l>
     <l n="96">Like jewels in the sun 's last rays —</l>
     <l n="97">I have a dwelling wide ;</l>
     <l n="98">Three rooms are mine , but I can go</l>
     <l n="99">Up to this roof in shade or shine ,</l>
     <l n="100">And watch all London change and glow</l>
     <l n="101">Rose , purple , gold ; three rooms are mine —</l>
     <l n="102">And all of heaven beside .</l>
    </lg>
    <p>SPARROWS</p>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="103">Brown little , fat little , cheerful sparrows !</l>
     <l n="104">I like to think , when I hear them chatter ,</l>
     <l n="105">How , when the brazen noise was gone</l>
     <l n="106">Of the chariot-wheels , with the sparks a-scatter ,</l>
     <l n="107">Their chirp was heard in old Babylon .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="108">In Babylon , and more ancient Memphis ,</l>
     <l n="109">They chattered and quarrelled , pecked and fumed ,</l>
     <l n="110">And loved their loves , and flew their ways ,</l>
     <l n="111">Where the royal Pharaohs lay entombed</l>
     <l n="112">Deep from the daylight 's vulgar gaze .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="19">
     <l n="113">Then , just such little homely fellows</l>
     <l n="114">( When the angry monarch , terrible ,</l>
     <l n="115">Watched his curled Assyrians writhe )</l>
     <l n="116">They sat , on a carven granite bull</l>
     <l n="117">Unheeding of anguish , feathered and blithe .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="20">
     <l n="118">So did they sit , on the roofs of Rome ,</l>
     <l n="119">And preen themselves in the morning sun ;</l>
     <l n="120">And Caesar saw them , brown and grey ,</l>
     <l n="121">Whisk in the dust , when his course was run</l>
     <l n="122">And he took to the Forum his fated way .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="21">
     <l n="123">Oh , changing time ; oh , sun and birds</l>
     <l n="124">How little changing . In the Square</l>
     <l n="125">This winter morning I have met</l>
     <l n="126">Old Egypt 's grandson , stopped him there ,</l>
     <l n="127">And “ Sir , you will outlive me yet , ”</l>
     <l n="128">Said I politely , “ mark my words . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <p>THE MOON IN JANUARY</p>
    <lg type="stanza" n="22">
     <l n="129">Sharp and straight are the scaffold poles ,</l>
     <l n="130">Black on a delicate sky ;</l>
     <l n="131">Upright they stand , across they lie ,</l>
     <l n="132">In changeless angles fixed and bound ,</l>
     <l n="133">The sunset light in mist is drowned ,</l>
     <l n="134">And the moon has risen high ;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="23">
     <l n="135">High above houses , high and clear</l>
     <l n="136">Above the scaffolding ,</l>
     <l n="137">So exquisite , so faint a thing ,</l>
     <l n="138">The young moon 's silver curve that shines</l>
     <l n="139">Above the fretting , tangled lines ,</l>
     <l n="140">With the old moon in her ring .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="24">
     <l n="141">The young moon holds the old black moon</l>
     <l n="142">In a sky all grey with frost ,</l>
     <l n="143">By cable wires barred and crossed ,</l>
     <l n="144">And below , the haze of purplish-brown</l>
     <l n="145">Smokes upward from the lamp-lit town</l>
     <l n="146">Where outlines all are lost .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="25">
     <l n="147">The pure pale arch of windless sky ,</l>
     <l n="148">The pure bright young moon 's thread ,</l>
     <l n="149">These wide and still are overhead ;</l>
     <l n="150">And in the dusky glare below</l>
     <l n="151">The lamps go dotting , row on row ,</l>
     <l n="152">And there is movement , to and fro ,</l>
     <l n="153">Where far the pavements spread .</l>
    </lg>
    <p>AN AUGUST NIGHT , 1914</p>
    <lg type="stanza" n="26">
     <l n="154">The light has gone from the West ; the wind has gone</l>
     <l n="155">From the quiet trees in the Park ;</l>
     <l n="156">From the houses the open windows yellowly shine ,</l>
     <l n="157">The streets are softly dark ;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="27">
     <l n="158">Row upon row the twisted chimneys stand ,</l>
     <l n="159">Each angle sharply lined ,</l>
     <l n="160">And the mass of the Institute rises , tower and dome ,</l>
     <l n="161">Black on the sky behind ;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="28">
     <l n="162">Green is the sky , like some strange precious stone ,</l>
     <l n="163">Dark , it yet holds the light</l>
     <l n="164">In its depths , like a bright thing shrouded over or veiled</l>
     <l n="165">By the creeping shadow of night ;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="29">
     <l n="166">And whiter than any whiteness there is upon earth</l>
     <l n="167">A faint star throbs and beats —</l>
     <l n="168">And the hurrying voices cry the news of the war ,</l>
     <l n="169">Below , in the quiet street .</l>
    </lg>
    <p>COUNTED OUT — OLYMPIA</p>
    <lg type="stanza" n="30">
     <l n="170">The small white space roped off ; the hard blue light</l>
     <l n="171">Burning intensely on the narrow ring ,</l>
     <l n="172">And every muscle 's movement sculpturing</l>
     <l n="173">Harshly , of those two naked men who fight ;</l>
     <l n="174">Beyond , the yellow lights that seem to swing</l>
     <l n="175">Across abysmal darkness ; and below ,</l>
     <l n="176">Tier upon tier , all silent , row on row</l>
     <l n="177">The dense black-coated throng , and all a-strain</l>
     <l n="178">White faces , turned towards the narrow stage ,</l>
     <l n="179">Watching intently ; watching , nerves and brain ,</l>
     <l n="180">As those two men , cut off in that blue glare</l>
     <l n="181">From all reality of place and age</l>
     <l n="182">Wherein our common being has a share ,</l>
     <l n="183">Together isolated , watch and creep</l>
     <l n="184">— Sunk head , hunched shoulders , light of foot and swift ,</l>
     <l n="185">Deadly of purpose — in that ancient game ,</l>
     <l n="186">Which was not otherwise in forests deep</l>
     <l n="187">Of earth primeval : that light tread the same ,</l>
     <l n="188">The same those watchful eyes , and those quick springs</l>
     <l n="189">Of a snake uncoiling ; underneath the skin ,</l>
     <l n="190">Glistening with sweat in that unearthly blaze ,</l>
     <l n="191">The muscles run and check , like living things .</l>
     <l n="192">And then , the hot air tremulous with the din ,</l>
     <l n="193">And all the great crowd surging to its feet ,</l>
     <l n="194">Yet like a wave arrested , while the hands</l>
     <l n="195">Of the referee allot the moments ’ beat ;</l>
     <l n="196">The seconds , strung like greyhounds on a leash</l>
     <l n="197">Await the signal ; and there 's one who stands</l>
     <l n="198">Still guarding , watchful , tense , while all around</l>
     <l n="199">Lamp-light and darkness seem to rock and spin</l>
     <l n="200">In one wild clamour ; and upon the ground ,</l>
     <l n="201">Beneath the stark blue light , the beaten man !</l>
    </lg>
    <p>THE GERMAN BAND</p>
    <lg type="stanza" n="31">
     <l n="202">When I was a little child</l>
     <l n="203">And lived very near the sky ,</l>
     <l n="204">A German band was wonderful music</l>
     <l n="205">That could almost make me cry .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="32">
     <l n="206">It was to me of a beauty</l>
     <l n="207">That I could not understand ,</l>
     <l n="208">Though I dimly guessed at sorrow and joy</l>

   <note>Life , in its unimaginable heights , When we may seize and apprehend the true Soul essence , of one nature with the stars : Rare moments when our senses are a mist That the truth shines through :— oh , most strange and rare , Such ecstasies as unimprisoned souls Experience in that thin empyrean Beyond the gross world ; this we two have known We two together . There are memories Of such high happiness in a fence of pain As martyrs in their fiery heart of death Have blessed their God for ; passion and holiness , When all the body ( sinew , bone , and brain ) Are like a harp , from which the spirit makes Marvels of harmony ; some sense too rare To be called happiness , not to be named indeed In human speech — this we have touched and known Together , at some thrilling edge of time . I fall away from it ; the barriers close About me ; I descend from the clear heights Into the plains and valleys of the world . The traffic of the market-place is mine , The heat and dust , the jostling and the noise , The kindly challenge and the neighbour-talk , All these may claim me , so that I forget To lift my eyes and see the far-off peaks , And the eternal splendour of the stars . So be it ; let the tide of men 's affairs Carry me back and forward ; let the rub Of greasy ha'pence passed from hand to hand , In humble traffic of a bunch of herbs Not pass me by ; let me jog arm in arm , Or cheek by jowl , the shady side o ’ the street , With friends and neighbours , glad to know them there , Imperfect , human , kind , and tolerant . So may the years go . Yet , when the call comes , And the world 's colours fade before the eye That turns for spiritual vision on itself ; When , from the four walls of the silent room , The noises of the world fall back and fail In that great silence which enrings the last Ecstatic moment of experience , Here on this earth — ah , then indeed I know That I shall find you . All that lies behind ( The years of trivial experience ) Shall open and fall back from off my soul , As falls the brown sheaf from the opening bud ; And in that poignant moment , that mere breath Of temporal time , that aeon of the soul , I shall reach out and know you , mix with you As flame with flame , as ray with ray of light , Be perfectly yourself , as you are me , With all else fallen , gone , dispersed away Save the pure drop of spiritual essence — Then Let come what may , light or oblivion .
