   <head>ARGUMENT</head>
   <p>In the morning of the world , while his tribe makes its camp for the night in a grove , Red Cloud , the first man of men , and the first man of the Nishinam , save in war , sings of the duty of life , which duty is to make life more abundant . The Shaman , or medicine man , sings of foreboding and prophecy . The War Chief , who commands in war , sings that war is the only way to life . This Red Cloud denies , affirming that the way of life is the way of the acorn - planter , and that whoso slays one man slays the planter of many acorns . Red Cloud wins the Shaman and the people to his contention .</p>
   <p>After the passage of thousands of years , again in the grove appear the Nishinam . In Red Cloud , the War Chief , the Shaman , and the Dew-Woman are repeated the eternal figures of the philosopher , the soldier , the priest , and the woman — types ever realizing themselves afresh in the social adventures of man . Red Cloud recognizes the wrecked explorers as planters and life-makers , and is for treating them with kindness . But the War Chief and the idea of war are dominant The Shaman joins with the war party , and is privy to the massacre of the explorers .</p>
   <p>A hundred years pass , when , on their seasonal migration , the Nishinam camp for the night in the grove . They still live , and the war formula for life seems vindicated , despite the imminence of the superior life-makers , the whites , who are flooding into California from north , south , east , and west — the English , the Americans , the Spaniards , and the Russians . The massacre by the white men follows , and Red Cloud , dying , recognizes the white men as brother acorn-planters , the possessors of the superior life-formula of which he had always been a protagonist .</p>
   <p>In the Epilogue , or Apotheosis , occur the celebration of the death of war and the triumph of the acorn-planters .</p>

    <head>PROLOGUE</head>
     <l n="1">Time . In the morning of the world .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Scene . A forest hillside where great trees stand with wide spaces between . A stream flows from a spring that bursts out of the hillside . It is a place of lush ferns and brakes , also , of thickets of such shrubs as inhabit a redwood forest floor . At the left , in the open level space at the foot of the hillside , extending out of sight among the trees , is visible a portion of a Nishinam Indian camp . It is a temporary camp for the night . Small cooking fires smoulder . Standing about are withe-woven baskets for the carrying of supplies and dunnage . Spears and bows and quivers of arrows lie about . Boys drag in dry branches for firewood . Young women fill gourds with water from the stream and proceed about their camp tasks . A number of older women are pounding acorns in stone mortars with stone pestles . An old man and a Shaman , or priest , look expectantly up the hillside . All wear moccasins and are skin-clad , primitive , in their garmenting . Neither iron nor woven cloth occurs in the weapons and gear .</p>

     <l n="2">I am Red Cloud ,</l>
     <l n="3">The first man of the Nishinam .</l>
     <l n="4">My father was the Coyote .</l>
     <l n="5">My mother was the Moon .</l>
     <l n="6">The Coyote danced with the stars ,</l>
     <l n="7">And wedded the Moon on a mid-summer night</l>

     <l n="10">Mine is his wisdom ,</l>

     <l n="15">The Nishinam were the first men ,</l>
     <l n="16">And they were without fire ,</l>
     <l n="17">And knew the bite of the frost of bitter nights .</l>
     <l n="18">The panther stole the fire from the East ,</l>
     <l n="19">The fox stole the fire from the panther ,</l>
     <l n="20">The ground squirrel stole the fire from the fox ,</l>
     <l n="21">And I , Red Cloud , stole the fire from the ground squirrel .</l>
     <l n="22">I , Red Cloud , stole the fire for the Nishinam ,</l>
     <l n="23">And hid it in the heart of the wood .</l>
     <l n="24">To this day is the fire there in the heart of the wood .</l>
     <l n="25">I am the Acorn-Planter .</l>
     <l n="26">I brought down the acorns from heaven .</l>
     <l n="27">I planted the short acorns in the valley .</l>
     <l n="28">I planted the long acorns in the valley .</l>
     <l n="29">I planted the black-oak acorns that sprout , that sprout !</l>
     <l n="30">I planted the sho-kum and all the roots of the ground .</l>
     <l n="31">I planted the oat and the barley , the beaver-tail grass-nut ,</l>
     <l n="32">The tar-weed and crow-foot , rock lettuce and ground lettuce ,</l>
     <l n="33">And I taught the virtue of clover in the season of blossom ,</l>
     <l n="34">The yellow-flowered clover , ball-rolled in its yellow dust .</l>
     <l n="35">I taught the cooking in baskets by hot stones from the fire ,</l>
     <l n="36">Took the bite from the buckeye and soap-root</l>
     <l n="37">By ground-roasting and washing in the sweetness of water ,</l>
     <l n="38">And of the manzanita the berry I made into flour ,</l>
     <l n="39">Taught the way of its cooking with hot stones in sand pools ,</l>
     <l n="40">And the way of its eating with the knobbed tail of the deer .</l>
     <l n="41">Taught I likewise the gathering and storing ,</l>
     <l n="42">The parching and pounding</l>
     <l n="43">Of the seeds from the grasses and grass-roots ;</l>
     <l n="44">And taught I the planting of seeds in the Nishinam home-camps ,</l>
     <l n="45">In the Nishinam hills and their valleys ,</l>

   <p>{ Red Cloud } Life is good , O Shaman , and I have sung but half its song . Acorns are good . So is woman good . Strength is good . Beauty is good . So is kindness good . Yet are all these things without power except for woman . And by these things woman makes strong men , and strong men make for life , ever for more life .</p>
   <p>{ War Chief } ( With gesture of interruption that causes remonstrance from the Shaman but which Red Cloud acknowledges . )</p>
   <p>I care not for beauty . I desire strength in battle and wind in the chase that I may kill my enemy and run down my meat .</p>
   <p>{ Red Cloud } Well spoken , O War Chief . By voices in council we learn our minds , and that , too , is strength . Also , is it kindness . For kindness and strength and beauty are one . The eagle in the high blue of the sky is beautiful . The salmon leaping the white water in the sunlight is beautiful . The young man fastest of foot in the race is beautiful . And because they fly well , and leap well , and run well , are they beautiful . Beauty must beget beauty . The ring-tail cat begets the ring-tail cat , the dove the dove . Never does the dove beget the ring-tail cat . Hearts must be kind . The little turtle is not kind . That is why it is the little turtle . It lays its eggs in the sun-warm sand and forgets its young forever . And the little turtle is forever the Kttle turtle . But we are not little turtles , because we are kind . We do not leave our young to the sun in the sand . Our women keep our young warm under their hearts , and , after , they keep them warm with deer-skin and campfire . Because we are kind we are men and not little turtles , and that is why we eat the little turtle that is not strong because it is not kind .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">{ War Chief }</l>
     <l n="2">( Gesturing to be heard . )</l>
     <l n="3">The Modoc come against us in their strength .</l>
     <l n="4">Often the Modoc come against us . We cannot</l>
     <l n="5">be kind to the Modoc .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>{ Red Cloud } That will come after . Kindness grows . First must we be kind to our own . After , long after , all men will be kind to all men , and all men will be very strong . The strength of the Nishinam is not the strength of its strongest fighter . It is the strength of all the Nishinam added together that makes the Nishinam strong . We talk , you and I , War Chief and First Man , because we are kind one to the other , and thus we add together our wisdom , and all the Nishinam are stronger because we have talked .</p>
   <p>( A voice is heard singing . Red Cloud holds up his hand for silence . )</p>
