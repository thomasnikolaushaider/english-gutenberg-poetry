    <p>IS THE AUTHOR OF THE PROGRESS OF KAY PUBLISHED BY CONSTABLE &amp; CO. LONDON NOTE If the mental attitude of any critic has ever , in his approach to a first book of verse , been conciliated by an appreciative notice from some older pen , I should say ( speaking out of no little experience ) that either the author was dead and the fact advertised in the preface , or , alternatively , that the critic was possessed by a gentler spirit than mine . I am sure at any rate that artistic work , great or small , should be sternly judged on what it is rather than on what it promises . The late J. Comyns Carr , in the days when he wrote dramatic criticism , let loose this restive truth in a couple of short sentences — ‘ We are told that So-and-so is a promising young actor . Personally I do n't care how much he promises so long as he never again performs . ’ Let me , then , pass over Mr Gerald Bullett 's verses with the simple remark that I believe in them ( he himself calls them ‘ MICE ’ — no overweening title , however boldly printed . Yet mice were dear to Apollo Smintheus , and his proper emblem ): and let me come to the general purpose of this Note . It is meant to preface a series of small volumes of verse by young writers , mostly Cambridge men . That , since the War , young men in extraordinary numbers have taken to expressing themselves in verse is a plain fact , not to be denied : that they choose , as often as not , to express themselves in ‘ numbers ’ extraordinary to us can as hardly be contested . But the point is , they have a crowding impulse to say something ; and to say it with the emotional seriousness proper to Poetry . For my part , I love the discipline of verse : but I love the impulse better . Time will soften — I hope not too soon , lest it sugar down and sentimentalise — a certain bitterness of resentment observable in this booklet and its next followers : but , as nothing in verse is nobler than true tradition , anything is more hopeful than convention .</p>
   </div>
   <titlePage>
    <docImprint>So these booklets have been planned to give youth its chance to make spoons or spoil horns . If anyone object that the print and page over-dignify the content of any one volume in the proposed series , why , that must be a particular criticism , which cannot honestly ( I think ) be enlarged to blame the publisher 's wish , and the care he has taken , that what pretends , however modestly , to be a work of the Muse , should step forth to the public in honourable dress .</docImprint>
