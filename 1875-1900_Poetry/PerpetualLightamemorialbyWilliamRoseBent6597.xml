    <head>FOREWORD</head>
    <p n="1">TERESA FRANCES THOMPSON , who also bore my name by marriage , died on January 26 , 1919 . This verse is published to her memory , because I wish to keep together the poetry she occasioned and enable those who loved her — and they were a great many-to know definitely what she was to me .</p>
    <p n="2">I think that is the truth . This is the only means I have at present of acknowledging publicly the vast debt I owe to her .</p>
    <p n="3">As I turn these poems over — if they are even to be called poems — I realize that they can never begin to express what her personality was . The earliest ones were written by a boy who was in love , and the latest by a man who has suddenly stepped into the dark . Those between are fragments from the days when we were struggling along together at the everyday tasks and outside interests and dreams that possessed us . The war entered our lives to change them in September , 1917 . The poem , “ Man Possessed , ” was written within sound of her actual voice , the others all in absence from her at various times and in moods made strange by absence .</p>
    <p n="4">And yet this is all I have at present to give in her memory . But I hold by these because — though they are poor , freakish fragments as far as any real expression of her is concerned — they were made for her .</p>
    <p n="5">It is even harder to express in bald prose a personality that had so many sides , so many varying strengths , such inner sight and yet such a forthright splendid intelligence . I have tried once to round it into periods — and have destroyed the attempt . It is my hope that the sister to whom she was devoted with an attachment altogether unusual to most of us will write of her .</p>
    <p n="6">If I merely recount the outlines of her life , it loses her . To say that her girlhood was given up to an intense and whole-souled devotion to the life of Christ as taught by the Roman Catholic Church will not even trace the outlines of that great spiritual adventure . But there , in the word “ adventure , ” is a dim ideograph of what she found in life . Every day was an adventure to her with the hope of accomplishing something over and above mere routine and the pursuit of pleasure . And she used to say to me that her life had simply been a series of experiments into which she had put her whole heart , and in which she had always failed . But , of course , she never failed .</p>
    <p n="7">She wrote me while I was stationed at Washington :</p>
    <p n="8">“ I am so very glad of your Sunday experience . I wish that I might have shared it with you , but I almost did , since we were at Mass there and walked across that green together .... No one else might be impressed by it , but you know . When I first thought of a convent I was about sixteen , and I did not go until I was twenty-one . During that time I had the habit of pretending when I went to sleep that I was lying full-length in a convent chapel before a dark altar , with its tiny light . When I went to the Little Sisters , with all its strangeness and homesickness and wrench away from everything , I was sustained by the knowledge that our bedroom on the third floor was across a wide hall from a rose window that looked right down into the Chapel . The dormitory had windows out into the hall , French fashion , so that when I opened the one at the head of my bed I was doing just what I had so often planned . You cannot imagine how personal it seemed to me .</p>
    <p n="9">“ Then years after when I was in the Carmelite convent in London , it began to snow . I stood at a window looking out at the snow upon the roofs , and began to think ( as you would have in my place ) , “ Deep on the convent roofs the snows are sparkling to the moon , ” — and suddenly I realized that it was St. Agnes Eve , and that long ago , when I was perhaps fifteen or sixteen , I had prayed that I might be a Carmelite nun in England . It was a thrill . No one else knew it . No one else could possibly have brought either of those two things about but Jesus Christ , the same yesterday , today , and forever . ”</p>
    <p n="10">And she wrote me later :</p>
    <p n="11">“ We will make a go of it together — I have been just where you are several times in my life . There is no denying that it hurts like the mischief , but there is something carried away out of it that the people who do n't go through with it do not have . When I came back from the Little Sisters , after affirming and reaffirming ( to strengthen my own resolution ) that I was never coming back , I had to face just the same old world , and the same streets and people . Then , after the earthquake , I left Paul Elder 's to go out to the settlement in the Mission . I was full of faith in it , to work among the poor , without the fetters of a convent , to plan a new way in which Catholic girls could dedicate themselves to the service of God , using the best of the Protestant and Catholic ideas both — and in three months I ... had handed in a report which criticized the whole place severely — and my resignation . I do not know now how much was personal spite on my part and how far I was right . And back to the same old circle at Paul Elder 's , with another bright bubble broken . Then came the Carmelites , which cost , I think , more than any , and I remember I so dreaded coming back to New York and facing everyone that I tried hard to get a position in London where women get $ 5. 00 a week as trained librarians . So back again . Well , education as the world hands it out to us is a mighty expensive thing . You give so much of your heart 's blood and get so little back in any tangible form , but ‘ youth shows but half ’ and we have not yet come to the harvesting years . We might as well sow hopes and plans and ambitions generously ‘ and stretch through time a hand to reap the far-off interest of tears ’ . ”</p>
    <p n="12">And she said of the number 19 in her life , in the late fall of 1918 :</p>
    <p n="13">“ I was thinking a lot about life this morning , coming home from church . You know the 27th of November is Mother 's anniversary .... Today is the Feast of the Immaculate Conception , always a great Catholic Feast ... Father 's birthday was the 23rd of December , he was buried on Christmas day — their wedding anniversary was December 3lst — my birthday is January first , J — ‘ s the seventh , Mother 's the fifth . So the whole season is full of memories , churches , masses , prayers , associations . And it struck me as strange that this New Year 's finishes another half of my life . I was nineteen that winter . This year I shall be just twice that . Nineteen years were all childhood , dreaming , planning , hoping , aspiring , but with no practical care , no responsibilities of any sort , the most sheltered existence a girl could have . And now nineteen of as varied an experience as most people know , teaching , housekeeping , bringing up the younger children , seven years of Paul Elder 's , the settlement house , travel , London , Rome , Paris , New York , the two convents in Chicago and London , extreme poverty , self-support , comfortable , moderate means , as you and I had , luxury such as this and the months with E —, six years a wife , five years a mother when J — ‘ s birthday rounds it out ,— the earthquake , which we thought transcended in size and importance anything that would ever happen to us , and then our little share of the tragedy of the war . Nineteen full years , n'esthYpppHeNce pas ? And now we start a new life , thank God , together . ”</p>
    <p n="14">She wrote me earlier , in 1917 , while I was waiting to be called to a Southern training camp :</p>
    <p n="15">“ I plan a home some day of the most Spartan simplicity , all our needs cut down to the lowest and plainest of possessions , and yet a spirit of hospitality , of contentment , of gaiety , of self-reliance and mutual helpfulness . Books and bookshelves ... ”</p>
    <p n="16">And of the Army :</p>
    <p n="17">“ It so often makes me think of the religious orders . The combination of the most heroic impulses with the most commonplace drudgery . The extraordinary fluctuations of feeling , thinking at one time that it is the only thing in the world to do ... and then the feeling , what am I doing this for , anyway , other people do not find it necessary ... As one nun said to me , ‘ You do not have to accept a Carmelite vocation — but , you have to either accept or refuse it . ’ The choice is laid before everyone , but once it is , all the coward has to do is to stand aside . ”</p>
    <p n="18">This last illustrates how she always saw the necessities of those she loved in terms of the spirit . Napoleon is reported to have said of Jesus Christ : “ He speaks from the soul as never man spoke ; the soul is sufficient for him , as he is sufficient for the soul . ”</p>
    <p n="19">So she thought . And her letters contain many quotations she formed her life by :</p>
    <p n="20">“ God himself is Truth , Charity , and Purity , and the three things he hates most are deceit , cruelty , and impurity . ”</p>
    <p n="21">“ God make us all saints ! ”</p>
    <p n="22">And the characteristic ending of a letter , with her full name always signed , such as :</p>
    <p n="23">“ Lord , grant us in this world knowledge of thy truth , and in the world to come life everlasting .</p>
    <p n="24">TERESA . ”</p>

   <p>But it is impossible to convey what her ways were with the children and in the several homes that she made so full of dreaming light . She had a keen appreciation of the humorousness and quaintness of children . She was always quoting to me their adventures , their sayings . She had countless plans and schemes for work in the world , and carried out many of them in relation to woman suffrage , baby clinics , camp-fire organization for the girls of our village , and , during the war , work with all the local organizations among women that it called into being where she was living at the time . She wanted to start a home in America for French widows and orphans , though this plan was not possible ,— she was deeply interested in the work for the protection of young girls under Miss Katharine Bement Davis , and only circumstances prevented her taking this up during the fall of 1918 . She had several interviews with Miss Davis and showed herself to be the very person who could have helped greatly . Self-denial , sacrifice , poverty , effort were the watchwords ever recurring to her . Her instant concentration upon any book or paper that came under her eyes became a family joke . She would be lost immediately , oblivious of all surroundings . She read and thought with a lively appreciation of the many futilities in life and a desire to make her life count . She wasted no time on what did not at once attract her spirit , except of necessity . And yet she genuinely delighted in the small events of a day such as please and awe children . And the reason they loved her so was because they knew she brought the same guileless point of view to solve their bewilderment from larger experience . And yet she would write :</p>
   <p>“ I wish I knew where I stood . I was much happier when I was a rigid Catholic . I wish I could fit back into that measure . Can I ever — any more than I can fit into the mental measure of a nun ? ”</p>
   <p>And again her typewriting would exclaim to me :</p>
   <p>“ I do n't like to write letters to you . I like to talk to you . I like still better to be silent with you ! ”</p>
   <p>When she thought me in need of it she could be very self-forgetful :</p>
   <p>“ But I want to see the future big with Romance for you and I would rather feel you came home from voyages two weeks or two months long , with a trunkful of manuscripts ; and that , three years from today , you had secured us special rates on a tramp steamer to Plymouth , than that you were going to dodge into subways the rest of your life . ”</p>
   <p>“ I would infinitely rather you shipped before the mast — to Bermuda , Borneo , or Buenos Aires . Do n't think from this I do n't want your face across the table from mine every night the rest of my life ! ”</p>
   <p>Reading to the children , she would retail to me such incidents as :</p>
   <p>“ Then I read them the Gospel stories , ... and they were too funny — R — trying to show me how Herod looked , and J — suggesting charitably that perhaps his wife was good . ‘ No , ’ said R —,' the whole family was bad ! ’ ”</p>
   <p>“ In the spring I am going to take an old farmhouse , give the children one brown garment apiece , and plan a scheme of living that will leave something over for other children . ”</p>
   <p>And this appealed to her :</p>
   <p>“ Well , if it is not in the Fall of 1918 , it will be in ‘ one of those houses Our Lord is building ’ as J — remarks casually . Did I tell you of the little village in the North Carolina hills where H — and S. L — spent the summer , where the women raised enough sheep to cut the wool , card , and spin and weave the clothes the family wore ? ”</p>
   <p>In the winter of 1914 she first visited Augusta , Georgia , where my father was stationed , and there the campaign against Child Labor , in which she was always vitally interested , became doubly real in necessity to her as she went through the cotton mills and saw conditions at close range . She always gave what sums she could to this cause . In 1915 , perhaps the most famous year of the woman suffrage battle , she was campaigning , speaking , watching all day at the polls in her village of Port Washington , Long Island . I remember her speaking from the stage of the Republican Club against a clever anti - suffragist from New York . Her voice reached out for something in the hearts of her audience hid deeper than the appeal of a mere legislative reform . She knew her intellectual ground , but it was something deeper than intellectuality that went home .</p>
   <p>In 1918 the Baby Welfare Movement was at its height . She became chairman of the Augusta committee and established clinics at the different schools and social centres .</p>
   <p>So I grasp at her life , giving only a slight indication of how full it was . Her friends were of every type and kind , of every religious belief or lack of belief , of many different political opinions .</p>
   <p>She hated war with her whole soul . It was directly opposed to the words of Christ . But she wrote me in a dark time :</p>
   <p>“ Italy is bad , Russia is bad , Cambrai is bad . But those things are only phases in the eternal struggle of right against wrong . And the only thing that matters is to personally throw your whole life into the balance for the things you believe to be right . ”</p>
   <p>How far I failed her ! It is given to every man to fight somehow through the bewilderment of life with the best intentions he can realize . And life seems to me like a fierce current on which we are borne rather than anything we can really master — except by forgetting it . She has left me with the feeling that I must know infinitely more and try to understand better , and that we are governed most truly only by the inexplicable . “ Meanwhile , there is our life here — Well ? ”</p>
   <p>The verse in this book is put as nearly as possible in the order of its writing . If there is any merit in any line of it , the merit is of her making . If there is none , the effort was , at least , to reach higher than my grasp — because of her . A writer is — and it is the ancient curse !— an egotist . But it is not my grief that I wish to display here . The human heart can fortunately never be put on paper . Only — reality assures of reality .</p>
   <p>Poetry is unconscionable because it follows true conscience . I knew , in her , that conscience ,— and know it in these fantastic shadows cast by her light . If you do also , be assured that the light still shines — forever .</p>
