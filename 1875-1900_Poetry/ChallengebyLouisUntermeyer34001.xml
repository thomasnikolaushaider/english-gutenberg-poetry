   <lg type="poem">
    <head>SUMMONS</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">The eager night and the impetuous winds ,</l>
     <l n="2">The hints and whispers of a thousand lures ,</l>
     <l n="3">And all the swift persuasion of the Spring</l>
     <l n="4">Surged from the stars and stones , and swept me on ...</l>
     <l n="5">The smell of honeysuckles , keen and clear ,</l>
     <l n="6">Startled and shook me , with the sudden thrill</l>
     <l n="7">Of some well-known but half-forgotten voice .</l>
     <l n="8">A slender stream became a naked sprite ,</l>
     <l n="9">Flashed around curious bends , and winked at me</l>
     <l n="10">Beyond the turns , alert and mischievous .</l>
     <l n="11">A saffron moon , dangling among the trees ,</l>
     <l n="12">Seemed like a toy balloon caught in the boughs ,</l>
     <l n="13">Flung there in sport by some too-mirthful breeze ...</l>
     <l n="14">And as it hung there , vivid and unreal ,</l>
     <l n="15">The whole world 's lethargy was brushed away ;</l>
     <l n="16">The night kept tugging at my torpid mood</l>
     <l n="17">And tore it into shreds . A warm air blew</l>
     <l n="18">My wintry slothfulness beyond the stars ;</l>
     <l n="19">And over all indifference there streamed</l>
     <l n="20">A myriad urges in one rushing wave ...</l>
     <l n="21">Touched with the lavish miracles of earth ,</l>
     <l n="22">I felt the brave persistence of the grass ;</l>
     <l n="23">The far desire of rivulets ; the keen ,</l>
     <l n="24">Unconquerable fervor of the thrush ;</l>
     <l n="25">The endless labors of the patient worm ;</l>
     <l n="26">The lichen 's strength ; the prowess of the ant ;</l>
     <l n="27">The constancy of flowers ; the blind belief</l>
     <l n="28">Of ivy climbing slowly toward the sun ;</l>
     <l n="29">The eternal struggles and eternal deaths —</l>
     <l n="30">And yet the groping faith of every root !</l>
     <l n="31">Out of old graves arose the cry of life ;</l>
     <l n="32">Out of the dying came the deathless call .</l>
     <l n="33">And , thrilling with a new sweet restlessness ,</l>
     <l n="34">The thing that was my boyhood woke in me —</l>
     <l n="35">Dear , foolish fragments made me strong again ;</l>
     <l n="36">Valiant adventures , dreams of those to come ,</l>
     <l n="37">And all the vague , heroic hopes of youth ,</l>
     <l n="38">With fresh abandon , like a fearless laugh ,</l>
     <l n="39">Leaped up to face the heaven 's unconcern ...</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="40">And then — veil upon veil was torn aside —</l>
     <l n="41">Stars , like a host of merry girls and boys ,</l>
     <l n="42">Danced gaily ‘ round me , plucking at my hand ;</l>
     <l n="43">The night , scorning its ancient mystery ,</l>
     <l n="44">Leaned down and pressed new courage in my heart ;</l>
     <l n="45">The hermit thrush , throbbing with more than Song ,</l>
     <l n="46">Sang with a happy challenge to the skies ;</l>
     <l n="47">Love , and the faces of a world of children ,</l>
     <l n="48">Swept like a conquering army through my blood —</l>
     <l n="49">And Beauty , rising out of all its forms ,</l>
     <l n="50">Beauty , the passion of the universe ,</l>
     <l n="51">Flamed with its joy , a thing too great for tears .</l>
     <l n="52">And , like a wine , poured itself out for me</l>
     <l n="53">To drink of , to be warmed with , and to go</l>
     <l n="54">Refreshed and strengthened to the ceaseless fight ;</l>
     <l n="55">To meet with confidence the cynic years ;</l>
     <l n="56">Battling in wars that never can be won ,</l>
     <l n="57">Seeking the lost cause and the brave defeat !</l>

     <l n="17">From compromise and things half-done ,</l>

     <l n="1">Who can be dull or wrapped in unconcern</l>
     <l n="2">Knowing a world so clamorous and keen ;</l>
     <l n="3">A world of ardent conflict , honest spleen ,</l>
     <l n="4">And healthy , hot desires too swift to turn ;</l>
     <l n="5">Vivid and vulgar — with no heart to learn ...</l>
     <l n="6">See how that drudge , a thing unkempt , unclean ,</l>
     <l n="7">Laughs with the royal laughter of a queen .</l>
     <l n="8">Even in her the eager fires burn .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">Who can be listless in these stirring hours</l>
     <l n="10">When , with athletic courage , we engage</l>
     <l n="11">To storm , with fierce abandon , sterner powers</l>
     <l n="12">And meet indifference with a joyful rage ;</l>
     <l n="13">Thrilled with a purpose and the dream that towers</l>
     <l n="14">Out of this arrogant and blundering age .</l>

     <l n="3">Child , you have come , like a conquering shout ,</l>

     <l n="1">How much of Godhood did it take —</l>
     <l n="2">What purging epochs had to pass ,</l>

     <l n="5">What mighty travails must have been ,</l>

     <l n="9">In what great struggles was I felled ,</l>

    <head>THE GREAT CAROUSAL</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Oh , do not think me dead when I</l>
     <l n="2">Beneath a bit of earth shall lie ;</l>
     <l n="3">Think not that aught can ever kill</l>
     <l n="4">My arrogant and stubborn will .</l>
     <l n="5">My buoyant strength , my eager soul ,</l>
     <l n="6">My stern desire shall keep me whole</l>
     <l n="7">And lift me from the drowsy deep ...</l>
     <l n="8">I shall not even yield to Sleep ,</l>
     <l n="9">For Death can never take from me</l>
     <l n="10">My warm , insatiate energy ;</l>
     <l n="11">He shall not dare to touch one part</l>
     <l n="12">Of the gay challenge of my heart .</l>
     <l n="13">And I shall laugh at him , and lie</l>
     <l n="14">Happy beneath a laughing sky ;</l>
     <l n="15">For I have fought too joyously</l>
     <l n="16">To let the conqueror conquer me —</l>
     <l n="17">I know that , after strengthening strife ,</l>
     <l n="18">Death cannot quench my love of life ;</l>
     <l n="19">Rob me of my dear self , my ears</l>
     <l n="20">Of music or my eyes of tears ...</l>
     <l n="21">No , Death shall come in friendlier guise ;</l>
     <l n="22">The cloths of darkness from my eyes</l>
     <l n="23">He shall roll back , and lo , the sea</l>
     <l n="24">Of Silence shall not cover me .</l>
     <l n="25">He shall make soft my final bed ,</l>
     <l n="26">Stand , like a servant , at my head ;</l>
     <l n="27">And , thrilled with all that Death may give ,</l>
     <l n="28">I shall lie down to rest — and live ...</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="29">And I shall know within the earth</l>
     <l n="30">A softer but a deeper mirth .</l>
     <l n="31">The wind shall never troll a song</l>
     <l n="32">But I shall hear it borne along ,</l>
     <l n="33">And echoed long before he passes</l>
     <l n="34">By all the little unborn grasses .</l>
     <l n="35">I shall be clasped by roots and rains ,</l>
     <l n="36">Feeding and fed by living grains ;</l>
     <l n="37">There shall not be a single flower</l>
     <l n="38">Above my head but bears my power ,</l>
     <l n="39">And every butterfly or bee</l>
     <l n="40">That tastes the flower shall drink of me .</l>
     <l n="41">Ah , we shall share a lip to lip</l>
     <l n="42">Carousal and companionship !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="43">The storm , like some great blustering lout ,</l>
     <l n="44">Shall play his games with me and shout</l>
     <l n="45">His joy to all the country-side .</l>
     <l n="46">Autumn , sun-tanned and April-eyed ,</l>
     <l n="47">Shall scamper by and send his hosts</l>
     <l n="48">Of leaves , like brown and merry ghosts ,</l>
     <l n="49">To frolic over me ; and stones</l>
     <l n="50">Shall feel the dancing in their bones .</l>
     <l n="51">And red-cheeked Winter too shall be</l>
     <l n="52">A jovial bed-fellow for me ,</l>
     <l n="53">Setting the startled hours ringing</l>
     <l n="54">With boisterous tales and lusty singing .</l>
     <l n="55">And , like a mother that has smiled</l>
     <l n="56">For years on every tired child ,</l>
     <l n="57">Summer shall hold me in her lap ...</l>
     <l n="58">And when the root stirs and the sap</l>
     <l n="59">Climbs anxiously beyond the boughs ,</l>
     <l n="60">And all the friendly worms carouse ,</l>
     <l n="61">Then , oh , how proudly , we shall sing</l>
     <l n="62">Bravuras for the feet of Spring !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="63">And I shall lie forever there</l>
     <l n="64">Like some great king , and watch the fair</l>
     <l n="65">Young Spring dance on for me , and know</l>
     <l n="66">That love and rosy valleys glow</l>
     <l n="67">Where'er her blithe feet touch the earth .</l>
     <l n="68">And headlong joy and reckless mirth</l>
     <l n="69">Seeing her footsteps shall pursue .</l>
     <l n="70">Oh , I shall watch her smile and strew</l>
     <l n="71">Laughter and life with either hand ;</l>
     <l n="72">And every quiver of the land ,</l>
     <l n="73">Shall pierce me , while a joyful wave</l>
     <l n="74">Beats in upon my radiant grave .</l>
     <l n="75">Aye , like a king in deathless state</l>
     <l n="76">I shall be throned , and contemplate</l>
     <l n="77">The dying of the years , the vast</l>
     <l n="78">Vague panorama of the past ,</l>
     <l n="79">The march of centuries , the surge</l>
     <l n="80">Of ages .... but the deathless urge</l>
     <l n="81">Shall stir me always , and my will</l>
     <l n="82">Shall laugh to keep me living still ;</l>
     <l n="83">Thrilling with every call and cry —</l>
     <l n="84">Too much in love with life to die .</l>
     <l n="85">Content to touch the earth , to hear</l>
     <l n="86">The whisper of each waiting year ,</l>
     <l n="87">To help the stars go proudly by ,</l>
     <l n="88">To speed the timid grass ; and lie ,</l>
     <l n="89">Sharing , with every movement 's breath ,</l>
     <l n="90">The rich eternity of Death .</l>

     <l n="1">Thank God for this bright frailty of Life ,</l>

     <l n="1">We sat together at the ocean 's edge ,</l>

     <l n="34">Cradled in that great beauty , and your arms ,</l>
     <l n="35">The cries and mad alarms</l>

     <l n="37">The tumult vanished , and the thought thereof ...</l>

     <l n="4">And its face was the face of a mother , and its voice was the</l>

     <l n="6">Sphinxes of silence , wraiths of mystery ;</l>
     <l n="7">A magic wood , a strange and scented wood</l>
     <l n="8">Where roses sprang from every withered tree .</l>
     <l n="9">A wood that woke his wonder and his fear ,</l>
     <l n="10">A wood of whispered spells and shameful lore ,</l>
