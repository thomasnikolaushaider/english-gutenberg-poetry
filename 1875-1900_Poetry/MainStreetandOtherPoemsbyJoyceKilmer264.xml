     <p>Main Street</p>
     <p>( For S. M. L .)</p>
     <lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">I like to look at the blossomy track of the moon upon the sea ,</l>
       <l n="2">But it is n't half so fine a sight as Main Street used to be</l>
       <l n="3">When it all was covered over with a couple of feet of snow ,</l>
       <l n="4">And over the crisp and radiant road the ringing sleighs would go .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="5">Now , Main Street bordered with autumn leaves , it was a pleasant thing ,</l>
       <l n="6">And its gutters were gay with dandelions early in the Spring ;</l>
       <l n="7">I like to think of it white with frost or dusty in the heat ,</l>
       <l n="8">Because I think it is humaner than any other street .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="9">A city street that is busy and wide is ground by a thousand wheels ,</l>
       <l n="10">And a burden of traffic on its breast is all it ever feels :</l>
       <l n="11">It is dully conscious of weight and speed and of work that never ends ,</l>
       <l n="12">But it cannot be human like Main Street , and recognise its friends .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="13">There were only about a hundred teams on Main Street in a day ,</l>
       <l n="14">And twenty or thirty people , I guess , and some children out to play .</l>
       <l n="15">And there was n't a wagon or buggy , or a man or a girl or a boy</l>
       <l n="16">That Main Street did n't remember , and somehow seem to enjoy .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="17">The truck and the motor and trolley car and the elevated train</l>
       <l n="18">They make the weary city street reverberate with pain :</l>
       <l n="19">But there is yet an echo left deep down within my heart</l>
       <l n="20">Of the music the Main Street cobblestones made beneath a butcher 's cart .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="21">God be thanked for the Milky Way that runs across the sky ,</l>
       <l n="22">That 's the path that my feet would tread whenever I have to die .</l>
       <l n="23">Some folks call it a Silver Sword , and some a Pearly Crown ,</l>
       <l n="24">But the only thing I think it is , is Main Street , Heaventown .</l>

       <l n="2">( For Amelia Josephine Burr )</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="3">The road is wide and the stars are out</l>
       <l n="4">and the breath of the night is sweet ,</l>
       <l n="5">And this is the time when wanderlust should seize upon my feet .</l>
       <l n="6">But I 'm glad to turn from the open road and the starlight on my face ,</l>
       <l n="7">And to leave the splendour of out-of-doors for a human dwelling place .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="8">I never have seen a vagabond who really liked to roam</l>
       <l n="9">All up and down the streets of the world and not to have a home :</l>
       <l n="10">The tramp who slept in your barn last night and left at break of day</l>
       <l n="11">Will wander only until he finds another place to stay .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="12">A gypsy-man will sleep in his cart with canvas overhead ;</l>
       <l n="13">Or else he 'll go into his tent when it is time for bed .</l>
       <l n="14">He 'll sit on the grass and take his ease so long as the sun is high ,</l>
       <l n="15">But when it is dark he wants a roof to keep away the sky .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="16">If you call a gypsy a vagabond , I think you do him wrong ,</l>
       <l n="17">For he never goes a-travelling but he takes his home along .</l>
       <l n="18">And the only reason a road is good , as every wanderer knows ,</l>
       <l n="19">Is just because of the homes , the homes , the homes to which it goes .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="20">They say that life is a highway and its milestones are the years ,</l>
       <l n="21">And now and then there 's a toll-gate where you buy your way with tears .</l>
       <l n="22">It 's a rough road and a steep road and it stretches broad and far ,</l>
       <l n="23">But at last it leads to a golden Town where golden Houses are .</l>

       <l n="1">The Snowman in the Yard</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="2">( For Thomas Augustine Daly )</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="3">The Judge 's house has a splendid porch , with pillars and steps of stone ,</l>
       <l n="4">And the Judge has a lovely flowering hedge that came from across the seas ;</l>
       <l n="5">In the Hales ’ garage you could put my house and everything I own ,</l>
       <l n="6">And the Hales have a lawn like an emerald and a row of poplar trees .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="7">Now I have only a little house , and only a little lot ,</l>
       <l n="8">And only a few square yards of lawn , with dandelions starred ;</l>
       <l n="9">But when Winter comes , I have something there</l>
       <l n="10">that the Judge and the Hales have not ,</l>
       <l n="11">And it 's better worth having than all their wealth —</l>
       <l n="12">it 's a snowman in the yard .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="13">The Judge 's money brings architects to make his mansion fair ;</l>
       <l n="14">The Hales have seven gardeners to make their roses grow ;</l>
       <l n="15">The Judge can get his trees from Spain and France and everywhere ,</l>
       <l n="16">And raise his orchids under glass in the midst of all the snow .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="17">But I have something no architect or gardener ever made ,</l>
       <l n="18">A thing that is shaped by the busy touch of little mittened hands :</l>
       <l n="19">And the Judge would give up his lonely estate , where the level snow is laid</l>
       <l n="20">For the tiny house with the trampled yard ,</l>
       <l n="21">the yard where the snowman stands .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="22">They say that after Adam and Eve were driven away in tears</l>
       <l n="23">To toil and suffer their life-time through ,</l>
       <l n="24">because of the sin they sinned ,</l>
       <l n="25">The Lord made Winter to punish them for half their exiled years ,</l>
       <l n="26">To chill their blood with the snow , and pierce</l>
       <l n="27">their flesh with the icy wind .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="28">But we who inherit the primal curse , and labour for our bread ,</l>
       <l n="29">Have yet , thank God , the gift of Home , though Eden 's gate is barred :</l>
       <l n="30">And through the Winter 's crystal veil , Love 's roses blossom red ,</l>
       <l n="31">For him who lives in a house that has a snowman in the yard .</l>

       <l n="3">Monsignore ,</l>
       <l n="4">Right Reverend Bishop Valentinus ,</l>
       <l n="5">Sometime of Interamna , which is called Ferni ,</l>
       <l n="6">Now of the delightful Court of Heaven ,</l>
       <l n="7">I respectfully salute you ,</l>
       <l n="8">I genuflect</l>
       <l n="9">And I kiss your episcopal ring .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="10">It is not , Monsignore ,</l>
       <l n="11">The fragrant memory of your holy life ,</l>
       <l n="12">Nor that of your shining and joyous martyrdom ,</l>
       <l n="13">Which causes me now to address you .</l>
       <l n="14">But since this is your august festival , Monsignore ,</l>
       <l n="15">It seems appropriate to me to state</l>
       <l n="16">According to a venerable and agreeable custom ,</l>
       <l n="17">That I love a beautiful lady .</l>
       <l n="18">Her eyes , Monsignore ,</l>
       <l n="19">Are so blue that they put lovely little blue reflections</l>
       <l n="20">On everything that she looks at ,</l>
       <l n="21">Such as a wall</l>
       <l n="22">Or the moon</l>
       <l n="23">Or my heart .</l>
       <l n="24">It is like the light coming through blue stained glass ,</l>
       <l n="25">Yet not quite like it ,</l>
       <l n="26">For the blueness is not transparent ,</l>
       <l n="27">Only translucent .</l>
       <l n="28">Her soul 's light shines through ,</l>
       <l n="29">But her soul cannot be seen .</l>
       <l n="30">It is something elusive , whimsical , tender , wanton , infantile , wise</l>
       <l n="31">And noble .</l>
       <l n="32">She wears , Monsignore , a blue garment ,</l>
       <l n="33">Made in the manner of the Japanese .</l>
       <l n="34">It is very blue —</l>
       <l n="35">I think that her eyes have made it more blue ,</l>
       <l n="36">Sweetly staining it</l>
       <l n="37">As the pressure of her body has graciously given it form .</l>
       <l n="38">Loving her , Monsignore ,</l>
       <l n="39">I love all her attributes ;</l>
       <l n="40">But I believe</l>
       <l n="41">That even if I did not love her</l>
       <l n="42">I would love the blueness of her eyes ,</l>
       <l n="43">And her blue garment , made in the manner of the Japanese .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="44">Monsignore ,</l>
       <l n="45">I have never before troubled you with a request .</l>
       <l n="46">The saints whose ears I chiefly worry with my pleas</l>
       <l n="47">are the most exquisite and maternal Brigid ,</l>
       <l n="48">Gallant Saint Stephen , who puts fire in my blood ,</l>
       <l n="49">And your brother bishop , my patron ,</l>
       <l n="50">The generous and jovial Saint Nicholas of Bari .</l>
       <l n="51">But , of your courtesy , Monsignore ,</l>
       <l n="52">Do me this favour :</l>

       <l n="54">To the Ivory Throne that bursts into bloom with roses</l>
