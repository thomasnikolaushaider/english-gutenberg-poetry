     <item>Alice , dear , what ails you , Dazed and white and shaken ? Has the chill night numbed you ? Is it fright you have taken ?</item>

     <item>Ay , the night was frosty , Coldly gaped the moon , Yet the birds seemed twittering Through green boughs of June .</item>
     <item>Soft and thick the snow lay , Stars danced in the sky . Not all the lambs of May-day Skip so bold and high .</item>
     <item>Your feet were dancing , Alice , Seemed to dance on air , You looked a ghost or angel In the starlight there .</item>
     <item>Your eyes were frosted starlight , Your heart fire and snow . Who was it said , “ I love you ” ?</item>
