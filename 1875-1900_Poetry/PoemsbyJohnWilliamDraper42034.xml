    <head>PREFACE</head>
    <p n="1">Most of the poems collected in this volume have already seen the light of print in the Colonnade , the monthly publication of the Andiron Club of New York University . The effort of the author has not been to write verses especially adapted to the taste of the modern public , but rather to create “ a thing of beauty ” from the theme that filled his mind at the time . Often he has been led into somewhat bold innovations such as the invention of the miniature ode , and the associating of an idea with a rime-motiv in the metrical short-stories . While he hopes that the new forms will justify themselves , he realizes that after all , the poems must stand or fall in proportion to the amount of pure artistic beauty contained within them .</p>

       <l n="2">Wake , love ; Aurora 's breath has tinged the sky ,</l>
       <l n="3">Mounting in faintly flushing shafts on high</l>
       <l n="4">To tell the world that Phoebus is at hand ;</l>
       <l n="5">And all the hours in a glittering band</l>
       <l n="6">Cluster around in sweeping , circling flight</l>
       <l n="7">Like angels bathing in celestial light .</l>
       <l n="8">See , now with one great shaft of molten gold ,</l>
       <l n="9">No longer vaporous haze around him rolled ,</l>
       <l n="10">The King of Day mounts the ethereal height ,</l>
       <l n="11">Scattering the last dim streamers of the night .</l>
       <l n="12">Bow down , ye Persians , on your altared hills ;</l>
       <l n="13">Worship the Sun-god who gives life , and fills</l>
       <l n="14">Your horn with plenteous blessings from on high .</l>
       <l n="15">Wake ! Wake ! before the dawning sunbeams die !</l>
       <l n="16">Fling incense on your temple 's dying flame ;</l>
       <l n="17">Sing chants and chorals in his mighty name ,</l>
       <l n="18">For as a weary traveler from afar ,</l>
       <l n="19">Or as a sailor on the harbor bar</l>
       <l n="20">After long absence spies his native town ,</l>
       <l n="21">So , with benignant brilliance smiles he down ;</l>
       <l n="22">Or , like a good king ruling o'er his land ,</l>
       <l n="23">He sprinkles blessings with a bounteous hand .</l>
       <l n="24">And thou , O my beloved , wake ! arise !</l>
       <l n="25">Has not the sun illumined night 's dull skies ?</l>
       <l n="26">Come , Phoebus ’ breath has tinged the summer morn .</l>
       <l n="27">Come , see the light shafts waver ‘ mong the corn .</l>
       <l n="28">Come , see the early lily 's opening bloom .</l>
       <l n="29">Come , see the wavering light expel the gloom</l>
       <l n="30">From yon dark vale still sunk in misty night .</l>
       <l n="31">Oh , watch the circling skylark 's heavenward flight ,</l>
       <l n="32">As , wrapped in hazy waves of shimmering light ,</l>
       <l n="33">In one grand Jubilate to the sun ,</l>
       <l n="34">He floods the sky with song of day begun .</l>
       <l n="35">But golden morn is never truly fair</l>
       <l n="36">Unless with day , thou com'st to weave my hair</l>
       <l n="37">With perfumed flowers gathered in the dell</l>
       <l n="38">Where sylphs sing sweetly ‘ bout the bubbling well .</l>
       <l n="39">Oh , fill my cup of pleasure with new wine</l>
       <l n="40">Which sparkles only where thy soft eyes shine !</l>
       <l n="41">O my beloved , haste thee to arise</l>
       <l n="42">Before the light has scorched the noonday skies !</l>
       <l n="43">The fleeting hours haste the falling sun ;</l>
       <l n="44">And soon the hour-glass of life is run .</l>

       <l n="6">No more to languish here with lingering sigh —</l>
       <l n="7">Rose from the foaming gulf where thou didst lie ,</l>
       <l n="8">Rose from the ragged sail and splintered spars ,</l>
       <l n="9">Rose to Elysium 's fairest bowers serene ;</l>
       <l n="10">There thine Ideal is ever at thy side ;</l>
       <l n="11">And soft Apollo 's hand doth strike the strings ;</l>
       <l n="12">And Philomel , behind a bowery screen ,</l>
       <l n="13">Pours forth Anacreon 's blessings on thy bride</l>
       <l n="14">Who to thine ear unceasing rapture sings .</l>

      <head>THE VISION OF DANTE</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">Upon my breast there weighed ten thousand waves</l>
       <l n="2">Of black , unthinkable despair ; I floated</l>
       <l n="3">In atmosphere of leaden density ,</l>
       <l n="4">In atmosphere that burned with heat , yet glowed not —</l>
       <l n="5">Then scintillating stars with vivid flashes ,</l>
       <l n="6">Like sparks from steel struck in a mine 's thick blackness ,</l>
       <l n="7">Tortured my eyes with dazzling glare ; and then</l>
       <l n="8">Arose a rumbling as of crashing tombs</l>
       <l n="9">When the dead waken . Gone my will , my power .</l>
       <l n="10">I could nor feel , nor move , nor cry . Creation</l>
       <l n="11">Seemed rending downward through eternal space .</l>
       <l n="12">The thundering ceased , there shot a wail of pain ,</l>
       <l n="13">A wail more anguished than arose from Troy</l>
       <l n="14">When Hector fell . Fainter , it grew , receding</l>
       <l n="15">Through the spheres . The meteors flashed no more .</l>
       <l n="16">I floated upward on invisible wings ;</l>
       <l n="17">The distance purpled in the glow of dawn ;</l>
       <l n="18">Funereal clouds melted to shimmering gray ;</l>
       <l n="19">And far away the notes of music sounded ,</l>
       <l n="20">Echoing onward to Infinity —</l>
       <l n="21">Music celestial of that choir of Heaven</l>
       <l n="22">Which sings unendingly about His throne .</l>
       <l n="23">Distant , it floated , yet how pure , and clearer</l>
       <l n="24">Than clear , rebounding Alpine notes . A present</l>
       <l n="25">Foretaste of the sublime beatitudes ;</l>
       <l n="26">And o'er my visual sky moved forms of beings ,</l>
       <l n="27">Dark forms in solemn , slow-ascending flight</l>
       <l n="28">Toward that rich , purple glow . The vision changed :</l>
       <l n="29">So pure the light that darkness sealed my eyelids !</l>
       <l n="30">So grand the symphony , I could not hear !</l>
       <l n="31">The whole cathedral-vault of Heaven rang</l>
       <l n="32">In awful majesty of perfect tone ;</l>
       <l n="33">And ‘ past my mortal vision , in endless tide ,</l>
       <l n="34">Flowing , and flowing upward toward the Light ,</l>
       <l n="35">Angels innumerable , many-hued ,</l>
       <l n="36">Winged on , majestic , to the music 's time ,</l>
       <l n="37">Winged on and sang a ceaseless Hallelujah —</l>

        <l n="2">Thy hopes , my fury-tempered steel shall blast .</l>
        <l n="3">Mine , mine , thou art ; David , thou shalt not rule .</l>
        <l n="4">This curse upon my seed is overpassed ;</l>
        <l n="5">And he who made it was some dream-crazed fool</l>
        <l n="6">Whose soul was such poor stuff as could not mast</l>
        <l n="7">Futurity 's wide ocean . David shall be</l>
        <l n="8">All fetter-bound , my captive prisoned fast ! ”</l>
        <l n="9">Before his tent , King Saul in triumph strode ;</l>
        <l n="10">About Prince David circled his array .</l>
        <l n="11">E'er the new sun had sipped the dew , would he</l>
        <l n="12">Close on the fugitive .— “ Brain-crazing thirst</l>
        <l n="13">Of jealousy that drives me on my way</l>
        <l n="14">Of torment , drain this cup ; and satiate be .</l>
        <l n="15">Thy hope , O line of David , fadeth fast</l>
        <l n="16">Like pallid starlight into morning cast . ”</l>
        <l n="17">Saul triumphed to the stars ; he gasped for air</l>
        <l n="18">As one might gasp upon a mountain 's height .</l>
        <l n="19">Revenge and hate swept storm-like through the lair</l>
        <l n="20">Where lurked his soul shrinking before the blast ;</l>
        <l n="21">“ Mine , mine , by high-enthroned Jehovah 's might ! ”</l>
        <l n="22">The words upon his lips were hot and fast .—</l>
        <l n="23">Thine , thine , thou say'st ? Him shalt thou never gain !</l>
        <l n="24">Thou dream'st a dream , O King ; it is in vain .</l>
        <l n="25">Once fixed , the star of forecast cannot wane .</l>
        <l n="26">Thine , thine , thou say'st ? It is in vain , in vain .—</l>
        <l n="27">Was it the echo tortured into shape</l>
        <l n="28">Of his own words ? Still stood the King aghast .</l>
        <l n="29">Did all this prisoning world leave no escape</l>
        <l n="30">From evil prophecy to his sworn vow ?</l>
        <l n="31">He clapped his hands . ( How the two sounds contrast ! )</l>
        <l n="32">A servant came who cringed before his brow .</l>
        <l n="33">“ Whence came that sighing voice ? Let no one go</l>
        <l n="34">About my tent . ” The man was silent . “ Now ,</l>
        <l n="35">My Lord ? ” he quavered . “ All has been quite still . ”</l>
        <l n="36">Saul 's forehead frowned : “ Return to rest — Or no ,</l>
        <l n="37">Order my men to muster ; ‘ tis my will</l>
        <l n="38">To seize the enemy at once , before</l>
        <l n="39">The light of morn . Soon shall I hold my foe ;</l>
        <l n="40">And when he 's bolted safe by gates thick-brassed ,</l>
        <l n="41">Then may my fury gorge its dread repast . ”</l>
        <l n="42">Again he smiled . Footsteps approached in sore ,</l>
        <l n="43">Short-tempered strides as one who comes from far .</l>
        <l n="44">Still paused the servant for Saul 's nod to go —</l>
        <l n="45">And Saul was smiling to the moon 's curved bar .</l>
        <l n="46">“ My Lord , my Lord , these tidings brook no pause ! ”</l>
        <l n="47">As if unwillingly , the King turned slow .</l>
        <l n="48">“ Philistines plunder thy rich-garnered grain ,</l>
        <l n="49">And flood thy fenced towns with waves of fire !</l>
        <l n="50">The land is overswept with bloody rain ;</l>
        <l n="51">Thy towered throne is tottering to the mire ! ”</l>
        <l n="52">Saul 's fingers clenched until the blood was near ;</l>
        <l n="53">He turned away ; the moon was hid from sight .</l>
        <l n="54">Only upon Prince David 's men one gleam</l>
        <l n="55">Pierced through the gloomy , cypress-shaded night .</l>
        <l n="56">“ Lost , lost — so near , and yet in vain , in vain — ”</l>
        <l n="57">His enemy who should displace his son ,</l>
        <l n="58">Would still live on while he must go and fight</l>
        <l n="59">To save the realm — save , for this hated one ?</l>
        <l n="60">He spoke ; his voice was tense : “ Awake my men ;</l>
        <l n="61">We must be marching far . ” A lightening beam</l>
        <l n="62">Of anguish flashed and re-flashed through his brain ;</l>
        <l n="63">And back there floated in his oral ken :</l>

        <l n="69">And many camp-fires vied with sunset skies ,</l>
        <l n="70">Yet fewer on the hills than blazed below</l>
        <l n="71">Down in the darkening valley where had grown</l>
        <l n="72">As many flickering lights as flakes of snow</l>
        <l n="73">That fall on wintry Lebanus .</l>
        <l n="74">Alone</l>
        <l n="75">Before his tent , strode Saul ; his head was bowed</l>
        <l n="76">As bows a palm tree to the tempest blast .</l>
        <l n="77">Was this deep thought ? Or was the spirit cowed</l>
        <l n="78">By some high-topping terror ? Then at last</l>
        <l n="79">Tensely he spoke as to the blackening cloud</l>
        <l n="80">That hung above the sunset : “ I , so strong ,</l>
        <l n="81">Yet cannot banish thee , ill-omened shroud ,</l>
        <l n="82">That round my writhing soul wraps as a pall</l>
        <l n="83">Of mute foreboding ?— He and Philistine join</l>
        <l n="84">In lowering hate against me on the plain —</l>
        <l n="85">God , God , my soul has sought Thy soul ; wherein</l>
        <l n="86">But Thine Omnipotence can triumph lie ?</l>
        <l n="87">Yet Thou art wordless .— Shall the King still call</l>
        <l n="88">Unto the Silent ? ”</l>
        <l n="89">The clouds were scudding fast</l>
        <l n="90">As if breathed through the Heavens by God 's sigh .</l>
        <l n="91">There turned his eyes ; then o'er the valley cast .</l>
        <l n="92">“ Yet will I win , ” he cried . “ Fate cannot last .</l>
        <l n="93">The days are all at odds ; the powers conspire</l>
        <l n="94">To crush my mortal Will . Oh , I will cast ,</l>
        <l n="95">And trample dim foreboding in the mire !</l>
        <l n="96">Let Fate come on ; I 'll meet him half the way ;</l>
        <l n="97">And win —— ” Ceased in the air his words .</l>
        <l n="98">Sudden ,</l>
        <l n="99">The sky grew dark ; a frail gust stirred the fire ,</l>
        <l n="100">Filling the air with monotone of woe :</l>
        <l n="101">“ Thou dream'st a dream ; it is in vain , in vain ;</l>
        <l n="102">Him never shalt thou gain —— ” The sound was flown .</l>
        <l n="103">With features fury-tortured , hands clenched fast ,</l>
        <l n="104">Up leaped he , straining arms stretched forth .</l>
        <l n="105">“ My foe</l>
        <l n="106">I 'll rend , rend , rend ; hear me ye breeze 's blast !</l>
        <l n="107">My royal root shall bloom ; and David — lost .</l>
        <l n="108">Jehovah 's evil Providence , I 'll cast</l>
        <l n="109">Into a sea embalmed in endless frost ! ”</l>

       <lg type="stanza" n="3">
        <l n="110">A witch dwelt high upon stern Endor 's cliff .</l>
        <l n="111">The place was dark : for night had drawn the veiling</l>
        <l n="112">Between the mountain peaks that stand still , stiff ,</l>
        <l n="113">The frozen sentinels of Time ; and sailing</l>
        <l n="114">Aloft upon the evening air , the smoke</l>
        <l n="115">Of hostile camp-fires blackened e'en the night .</l>
        <l n="116">Here dwelt this hag to horrid witchcraft given ,</l>
        <l n="117">A withered , fangless thing whose mutterings spoke</l>
        <l n="118">Of all the secrets of Hell 's shadow-light .</l>
        <l n="119">The wind was coldly wailing . Near her fire ,</l>
        <l n="120">She crouched . Behind her , through a passage riven</l>
        <l n="121">By some swift thunderbolt of wrath divine ,</l>
        <l n="122">Appeared a man in closely wrapped attire .</l>
        <l n="123">Like some lithe snake she turned and cringed</l>
        <l n="124">In fear and yet in anger : “ By what sign ,</l>
        <l n="125">And wherefore come you here ? ” her lips half snarled .</l>
        <l n="126">The man unwrapped his mantle deeply fringed ;</l>
        <l n="127">He threw a purse before her . “ For this cost ,</l>
        <l n="128">Let thine unseen familiar call from rest</l>
        <l n="129">The one I name to thee ” — She rose all gnarled ;</l>
        <l n="130">And thus she spake : “ Seek not to hide thy mien ;</l>
        <l n="131">My spirit tells me that thou art — ” Her lean</l>
        <l n="132">Hand grasped the splintered rock — “ Thou art the King !</l>
        <l n="133">And whom wouldst thou , my Lord , seek in this fane</l>
        <l n="134">Of Chaldee calculations , law and ring ? ”</l>
        <l n="135">“ Serve me but well to-night ; and be thou wise —</l>
        <l n="136">Charm as I bid ; and gratitude shall last</l>
        <l n="137">All time from me to thee — fulfill this quest — ”</l>
        <l n="138">He paused his speech and glanced to either side —</l>
        <l n="139">“ Summon me Samuel . Let his spirit rise</l>
        <l n="140">Upon the night in wreathed , hazy guise . ”</l>
        <l n="141">The fire-embers faded red , and died ;</l>
        <l n="142">King Saul sat staring into sable space ;</l>
        <l n="143">The witch was mumbling by the fire-side</l>
        <l n="144">Whence curled up wisps of smoke . His heart beat fast .</l>
        <l n="145">Within the gray appeared a dim-lit face .</l>
        <l n="146">In silent terror gazed the King . At last ,</l>
        <l n="147">Was audible a voice upon the wind :</l>
        <l n="148">“ What would'st thou , Saul ? What would'st thou learn from me ? ”</l>
        <l n="149">“ Samuel , ‘ tis thou — ” and then , as in a gust</l>
        <l n="150">The storm sweeps down upon the plain , words burst</l>
        <l n="151">In hot-lipped passion uncontrolled and fast —</l>
        <l n="152">“ Aid me ; O , aid me ; for I yearn , I thirst</l>
        <l n="153">To drink this David 's blood . The frenzied lust</l>
        <l n="154">Of unfulfilled ambition desert-dry</l>
        <l n="155">Burns in my throat . Is my seed barren cast</l>
        <l n="156">On earth ? Am I condemned to plod , a beast</l>
        <l n="157">For any burden ? Spectre , tell me why</l>
        <l n="158">Should I be King of men , and yet the least</l>
        <l n="159">Who cannot even hold or give mine own ? ”</l>
        <l n="160">“ The princely David shalt thou never gain ;</l>
        <l n="161">Thou dream'st a dream , O King , it is in vain —</l>
        <l n="162">Once fixed , the star of forecast cannot wane —</l>
        <l n="163">The star of forecast cannot wane — wane — wane — ”</l>
        <l n="164">The spectre 's voice swept on upon the wind ;</l>
        <l n="165">The spectre faded into argent gloom .</l>
        <l n="166">Down shot a nacreous moonbeam dim-outlined .</l>
        <l n="167">The King 's eyes fell upon the armied plain .</l>
        <l n="168">There rose a shout again , and yet again —</l>
        <l n="169">Below was movement , battling of armed men ,</l>
        <l n="170">And shrieking clash of arms . How fiercely shines</l>
        <l n="171">That flaring light ! His camp was sheathed in flame !</l>
        <l n="172">In flame that wrote upon his soul the lines :</l>
        <l n="173">“ Once fixed the star of forecast cannot wane ;</l>
        <l n="174">Thine all has been in vain , in vain , in vain — ”</l>

      <head>THE PROPHECY OF SAINT MARK</head>
      <head>A METRICAL SHORT-STORY</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">Pale night upon its swift , aerial loom</l>
       <l n="2">Wove the soft , vaporous substance of the gloom .</l>
       <l n="3">The story-sculptured Gothic porch lay dim</l>
       <l n="4">And silent in drab haze with which the spring</l>
       <l n="5">Covers its carpentry of summer bloom .</l>
       <l n="6">A maiden stood within the porch 's pale .</l>
       <l n="7">“ It is the night , ” she sighed , “ Saint Marcus ’ night</l>
       <l n="8">When ghosts of all foredoomed to sickness wing</l>
       <l n="9">Into the church to pray ; so runs the tale .</l>
       <l n="10">Those who make no return shall feel the grim ,</l>
       <l n="11">Fell scythe of Death within the year . The light</l>
       <l n="12">Must flicker up each face as past they sail .</l>
       <l n="13">But Gascon , O my Gascon , shalt thou die ?</l>
       <l n="14">Year after year , I wait — Thy strong-wrought mail</l>
       <l n="15">Surely is sword-proof — ” And a hovering sigh</l>
       <l n="16">Passed through her lips more still than silence , frail .</l>
       <l n="17">The lowering mist grew darker . From the womb</l>
       <l n="18">Of day , young night was born . The paling light</l>
       <l n="19">Was flecked with haze-clouds flickering in the gloom ;</l>
       <l n="20">And to and fro in stately pageantry ,</l>
       <l n="21">Strange shadow-shapes like liquid-silver spume</l>
       <l n="22">Charmed into lightness , formed an imagery</l>
       <l n="23">Of things half-human .</l>
       <l n="24">Still the maiden pale</l>
       <l n="25">Waited and hung upon each shadowy trail</l>
       <l n="26">Of lingering vapors fainting to and fro .</l>
       <l n="27">They took the shape of flitting forms in mail</l>
       <l n="28">Or monkish cowl . A Merlin-magic spell</l>
       <l n="29">Seemed laid upon her . “ And art thou to go ? ”</l>
       <l n="30">She whispered as some well-known face amid</l>
       <l n="31">The rest swept by her through that portal fell .</l>
       <l n="32">And some , not marked for Death , returned again ;</l>
       <l n="33">And some returned not . O'er the porch 's rail ,</l>
       <l n="34">Leant her light body as she scanned each form ,</l>
       <l n="35">And tensely looked with terror anxious-eyed .</l>
       <l n="36">Why does she shrink with all-consuming pain ,</l>
       <l n="37">And seek to gaze again ? A blinding storm</l>
       <l n="38">Of anguish breaks upon her . “ O what doom</l>
       <l n="39">Is this for thee and me ? Why doest thou glide</l>
       <l n="40">Into this silent , terror-freighted tomb ? ”</l>
       <l n="41">Pale Gascon 's figure fled along the tide —</l>
       <l n="42">Some forms not marked for Death returned again ;</l>
       <l n="43">But his returned not . Ever anguish-eyed ,</l>
       <l n="44">She paused and waited — waited in the gloom .</l>
       <l n="45">At last the flying cloud flakes ceased to come ;</l>
       <l n="46">And stilly night arose . “ My God , to whom</l>
       <l n="47">May I turn now ? My richest Self is rent ! ”</l>
       <l n="48">Down from the carven doorway stumbling slow ,</l>
       <l n="49">The maiden passed , silent with languishment .</l>
       <l n="50">Forth from the darkness stepped a man . All dumb ,</l>
       <l n="51">She gazed in careless stupor such as woe</l>
       <l n="52">Stamps on the soul .</l>
       <l n="53">“ My Lady , may I dare — ”</l>
       <l n="54">He paused , and gazed , bowed sweepingly and low ,</l>
       <l n="55">Then spoke again . She stood there sad and fair ,</l>
       <l n="56">Quivering like a heat-cloud in the air .</l>
       <l n="57">“ Lady , a traveler asks the way to where</l>
       <l n="58">He may find rest and lodgement . ” One brief while ,</l>
       <l n="59">She stayed herself in stupor ; ‘ tis but meet ,</l>
       <l n="60">A soul come slowly from behind the veil .</l>
       <l n="61">“ Come — come , ” she said , upon her face a smile</l>
       <l n="62">Of sorrow blent with some strange joyance pale .</l>
       <l n="63">They passed along the quaintly cobbled street ,</l>
       <l n="64">And then turned through a lane where high up-reared ,</l>
       <l n="65">The gloomy oaks and hawthorne hedges greet</l>
       <l n="66">The eye on either hand . A cottage stood</l>
       <l n="67">With banks of sleepy flowers at its feet ;</l>
       <l n="68">And all around , the giant , hoary wood</l>
       <l n="69">Frowned down its shadows on the garden 's bloom ,</l>
       <l n="70">Frowned down , a fateful harbinger of gloom .</l>
       <l n="71">Within the cottage , all was warmth and cheer .</l>
       <l n="72">There stayed the mother waiting the return</l>
       <l n="73">Of her sweet child . They entered . She did greet</l>
       <l n="74">Both with an all-inclusive smile , and clear ,</l>
       <l n="75">Unchanging peace and kindliness that burn</l>
       <l n="76">Before a pure soul 's shrine . “ Whom have we here ,</l>
       <l n="77">Marie ?— Some houseless stranger gone astray ? ”</l>
       <l n="78">He doffed his feathered cap and bowed full low .</l>
       <l n="79">“ After long twilight wanderings in despair</l>
       <l n="80">Of any hermitage for night , not far</l>
       <l n="81">From here , I prayed your daughter 's guidance ere</l>
       <l n="82">The dark should leave me but a chance faint star</l>
       <l n="83">By which to fare . ”</l>
       <l n="84">Beside the oaken board ,</l>
       <l n="85">They sat and ate the rustic dishes there ,</l>
       <l n="86">While young Sir Guy poured forth a glittering hoard</l>
       <l n="87">Of warriored stories gathered far away :</l>
       <l n="88">How one brave knight pierced twenty paynim through ;</l>
       <l n="89">And how another fled from the affray</l>
       <l n="90">To be enslaved by Sarazain corsair .</l>
       <l n="91">The maiden hungered for each word . How frail</l>
       <l n="92">Be warriors ’ lives ! Upon the thought , she knew</l>
       <l n="93">A bitter memory of forecast 's gloom .</l>
       <l n="94">Oh , she must fly . Oh , something must avail</l>
       <l n="95">To give her refuge from this festering sting .</l>
       <l n="96">She tried to turn her mind from sorrow 's trail ,</l>
       <l n="97">And gave her thoughts to the narrator 's tale .</l>
       <l n="98">Now he was speaking of a lord who strove</l>
       <l n="99">To win his lady ; but the Christian war</l>
       <l n="100">Called him to battle for his Faith . He clove</l>
       <l n="101">Damascus steel and clinking casques ; but e'er</l>
       <l n="102">He could return — Sir Guy then ceased ; for here</l>
       <l n="103">Arose a warning on the mother 's brow .</l>
       <l n="104">She wished no bitter recollections . Fear</l>
       <l n="105">For Marie 's plausance was her only care .</l>
       <l n="106">Soon all the cottage slept ‘ mid the garden 's bloom ;</l>
       <l n="107">And fatefully the forest frowned its gloom .</l>
       <l n="108">The summer blossomed , faded , and then died ;</l>
       <l n="109">And still as if enchanted , stayed he there .</l>
       <l n="110">They took long walks o'er lonely hill and dale ,</l>
       <l n="111">And went across the fields with flowers pied .</l>
       <l n="112">At times their voices rang upon the air ;</l>
       <l n="113">But ever when they came upon that vale</l>
       <l n="114">Where , in its flowery charm , the cottage stood ,</l>
       <l n="115">Their talk would fail within the vasty wood .</l>
       <l n="116">Thus bathed their souls in summer 's sultry tide</l>
       <l n="117">Like flashing moths upon the wind that ride .</l>
       <l n="118">And hectic autumn came and brought its charm</l>
       <l n="119">Of leafy brilliance heralding its death .</l>
       <l n="120">Beside the evening blaze , full many a tale</l>
       <l n="121">He told of knights in chivalrous career ;</l>
       <l n="122">But never raised the fluttering alarm</l>
       <l n="123">Of the maiden 's mother by the faintest breath</l>
       <l n="124">Of the warrior lord and his loved one dear .</l>
       <l n="125">Then hoary , chilling winter shrouded pale ,</l>
       <l n="126">Came , and passed by : thus wandered on , the year .</l>
       <l n="127">The spring was coldly wrapped in sullen haze ;</l>
       <l n="128">Even the mounting sun seemed scarce as warm</l>
       <l n="129">As during winter . Slowly passed the days</l>
       <l n="130">Until the Eve of blest Saint Marcus came .</l>
       <l n="131">Among the misty-shadowed forest ways ,</l>
       <l n="132">Sir Guy did bring the maiden arm in arm .</l>
       <l n="133">How oft the times that they had done the same —</l>
       <l n="134">“ I 've lived a life , careless and debonair ,</l>
       <l n="135">And know nor fettering bonds nor fear ;</l>
       <l n="136">Yet would I leave it all without a care — ”</l>
       <l n="137">She upward glanced and then glanced down as pale</l>
       <l n="138">As any flowing haze-wreath in the gloom .</l>
       <l n="139">“ Oh , what is that ? ” she cried . The misty veil</l>
       <l n="140">Parted and showed a glimpse of rock-built wall .</l>
       <l n="141">“ ‘ Tis but the village kirk , ” he said . A pall</l>
       <l n="142">Of haze enwrapped them like the Will of Doom .</l>
       <l n="143">She stood and faced him , quivering as a sail</l>
       <l n="144">That blows uncertain in a varying wind .</l>
       <l n="145">“ Marie , Marie , ” he faltered . Then a flare</l>
       <l n="146">Of passion burnt his soul out in his eyes .</l>
       <l n="147">Downward she glances seeming unaware ;</l>
       <l n="148">But in her heart beneath the outward guise ,</l>
       <l n="149">Warring emotions make her spirit quail .</l>
       <l n="150">Gascon 's loved image into vision flies ;</l>
       <l n="151">And yet her rising love , she cannot quell</l>
       <l n="152">For brave Sir Guy ; and then , as when the flail</l>
       <l n="153">Lashes the chaff , dim mist before her flies</l>
       <l n="154">Into the church in Gascon 's image pale .</l>
       <l n="155">The year is out . What then , should he avail ?</l>
       <l n="156">“ Marie — ” Sir Guy is breathing on the air ;</l>
       <l n="157">She reads the rest within his flaming eyes .</l>
       <l n="158">“ Yes — yes , ” she murmurs .</l>
       <l n="159">“ O despair , despair !</l>
       <l n="160">I have no hope ; you fell into the snare ! ”</l>
       <l n="161">His eyes dilated with mad light , he cries .</l>
       <l n="162">“ I , I am Gascon whose memory you dare</l>
