     <p>THESEUS AND HIPPOLYTA TO J. G. FAIRFAX</p>
     <lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">Noon smote down on the field ,</l>
       <l n="2">Burning on spears and helms ,</l>
       <l n="3">Shining from Theseus ’ shield .</l>
       <l n="4">As a wave of the sea that whelms</l>
       <l n="5">A rock , and its crest uprears ,</l>
       <l n="6">Through the wreck of the trampled wheat</l>
       <l n="7">The charge of the charioteers</l>
       <l n="8">Thundering broke . A sleet</l>
       <l n="9">Veiled light , and the air was alive ,</l>
       <l n="10">As with hissing of snakes , as with swarms</l>
       <l n="11">Of the Spring by a populous hive ,</l>
       <l n="12">As with wind , and the clamour of storms :</l>
       <l n="13">So hurtled the arrowy hail</l>
       <l n="14">Loosed from the Amazon ranks ,</l>
       <l n="15">Smote ringing on brazen mail ,</l>
       <l n="16">Struck fanged through the shuddering flanks</l>
       <l n="17">Of the stallions ; and half were hurled</l>
       <l n="18">In the dust , and broken , and brayed</l>
       <l n="19">By the chariots over them whirled ,</l>
       <l n="20">Which , eager and undismayed ,</l>
       <l n="21">Swept ruining on to the hordes</l>
       <l n="22">Of the Amazonian camp ,</l>
       <l n="23">With the lightning of terrible swords ;</l>
       <l n="24">Till the dead were heaped , as a ramp</l>
       <l n="25">For the quick . But the chariots shocked</l>
       <l n="26">On the thicket of close-set spears ;</l>
       <l n="27">And the long ranks reeled , and rocked ,</l>
       <l n="28">Broke ; and the charioteers</l>
       <l n="29">Went through them , cleaving as ploughs</l>
       <l n="30">Cleave earth : they were rent , and tossed</l>
       <l n="31">With the tumult of tortured boughs .</l>
       <l n="32">And the stallions , with foam embossed ,</l>
       <l n="33">Fought , tearing each other with teeth ,</l>
       <l n="34">In the red , blind rage of their lust ,</l>
       <l n="35">Screaming ; and writhed underneath</l>
       <l n="36">The wounded , trodden as must</l>
       <l n="37">Of the grapes trodden out in the press ,</l>
       <l n="38">Empurpling the knees , and bare</l>
       <l n="39">Thighs of the men . Through the stress</l>
       <l n="40">Of their shoulders drove as a share ,</l>
       <l n="41">Hippolyta . Avenging she came ;</l>
       <l n="42">And they streamed , and they surged round her car ,</l>
       <l n="43">The women : her face was a flame</l>
       <l n="44">As she rode through the tempest of war ;</l>
       <l n="45">And they cried , made glad with the sight ,</l>
       <l n="46">As those desiring the dawn ,</l>
       <l n="47">When the darkness is cloven by light ,</l>
       <l n="48">Cry for gladness : they rallied , upborne ,</l>
       <l n="49">When she rayed as the sun through their cloud .</l>
       <l n="50">But she strung the bow , and she prayed</l>
       <l n="51">Unto Artemis , calling aloud ,</l>
       <l n="52">As a maid might call to a maid ;</l>
       <l n="53">And the Goddess of shining brows</l>
       <l n="54">Heard , as she paused from the chace</l>
       <l n="55">Upon Tainaros hoary with snows ;</l>
       <l n="56">And a shadow darkened her face :</l>
       <l n="57">A shadow , and then a ray</l>
       <l n="58">Lightening , glorying , smiled ,</l>
       <l n="59">As her thought pierced years to a day</l>
       <l n="60">Unborn , and an unborn child ,</l>
       <l n="61">With the pure fount of his praise</l>
       <l n="62">Lifted to her , from the shrine</l>
       <l n="63">Rock-hewn , at the three cross-ways</l>
       <l n="64">In a waste of hills , as wine</l>
       <l n="65">Gladdening her ; and she shed</l>
       <l n="66">A wonder , a terror , a fear ,</l>
       <l n="67">A beauty that filled with dread ,</l>
       <l n="68">A glory no eyes might bear</l>
       <l n="69">On her maid ; stooped , hushed , from the height</l>
       <l n="70">Her thought , as a bird on the wing ,</l>
       <l n="71">Rained down from her , swifter than light .</l>
       <l n="72">Hippolyta notched on the string</l>
       <l n="73">An arrow , and loosed it , and smote ,</l>
       <l n="74">As he drove at her car with a jest ,</l>
       <l n="75">Agelaus , cleaving his throat</l>
       <l n="76">Speechless ; and smote through the breast</l>
       <l n="77">Polytherses ; and Euenor then</l>
       <l n="78">Felt the teeth of the flints at his veins ,</l>
       <l n="79">As his mares dragged him back to his men</l>
       <l n="80">All bloody , entangled in reins ;</l>
       <l n="81">Then Damastor she smote : and they fled</l>
       <l n="82">As doves or as linnets fly</l>
       <l n="83">When a hawk that has towered overhead</l>
       <l n="84">Stoops , ravening , out of the sky</l>
       <l n="85">On their quires . But her arrows sighed</l>
       <l n="86">After them , swifter than feet :</l>
       <l n="87">They ran , shrieked , stumbled , and died ,</l>
       <l n="88">Shot through with her shafts . In the wheat ,</l>
       <l n="89">With the sunlight gilding their greaves ,</l>
       <l n="90">Helmets , and shields , and mail ,</l>
       <l n="91">They lay , strewn thickly as leaves</l>
       <l n="92">When Autumn has swung his flail .</l>
       <l n="93">But afar , where Thermodon rolled</l>
       <l n="94">The deep , swift strength of its flood</l>
       <l n="95">To the ocean turbidly gold ,</l>
       <l n="96">Drave Theseus , eager for blood ;</l>
       <l n="97">And as herds stampede in affright</l>
       <l n="98">At the reek of the beast in the air</l>
       <l n="99">Precipitately through the night</l>
       <l n="100">When a lion forth comes from his lair ,</l>
       <l n="101">So the women before him fled</l>
       <l n="102">In a rout , headlong , overborne ,</l>
       <l n="103">For he drave as a beast all red ,</l>
       <l n="104">With the blood of the prey he had torn ,</l>
       <l n="105">Circled them round ; they were rent ,</l>
       <l n="106">Whirled under him , flung from him , far</l>
       <l n="107">Seaward , and lost ; until spent ,</l>
       <l n="108">Heaped in a mound by her car</l>
       <l n="109">Broken , and dying , and dead ,</l>
       <l n="110">Hippolyta saw . And she fled .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="111">Theseus followed . Afar ,</l>
       <l n="112">Over the storm of the spears ,</l>
       <l n="113">He had seen her face as a star</l>
       <l n="114">Shine ; and no tremble of tears</l>
       <l n="115">Softened her terrible eyes ,</l>
       <l n="116">Cruel they shone there , and blue</l>
       <l n="117">With the beauty of windless skies .</l>
       <l n="118">But her bowstring ever she drew ,</l>
       <l n="119">Loosening arrows that sang</l>
       <l n="120">Through the air exulting as wind ;</l>
       <l n="121">And the clamour of battle rang</l>
       <l n="122">Most by her car , while behind</l>
       <l n="123">The fierce , wild women upheld</l>
       <l n="124">Their queen , and their anger burned</l>
       <l n="125">In staring eyeballs . She felled</l>
       <l n="126">A man as her car overturned ,</l>
       <l n="127">Sped onward , her swift white feet</l>
       <l n="128">The dead and the dying spurned</l>
       <l n="129">Who lay in the wasted wheat .</l>
       <l n="130">Theseus followed his prey</l>
       <l n="131">As a lean hound follows the fleet</l>
       <l n="132">Quarry : the dusty way</l>
       <l n="133">Smoked with the speed of his feet .</l>
       <l n="134">She was swift ; but he burned in the chace :</l>
       <l n="135">He was flame , he was sandalled with fire ,</l>
       <l n="136">Hungering after her face ,</l>
       <l n="137">With a fury , a lust , a desire ,</l>
       <l n="138">As a hound that whines for the blood</l>
       <l n="139">Of the hart flying winged with fear ;</l>
       <l n="140">And she yearned , and she longed for the wood ,</l>
       <l n="141">Seeming far from her still , though near ,</l>
       <l n="142">And she strained , and she panted , and pressed ,</l>
       <l n="143">With her head flung backward for breath ,</l>
       <l n="144">And the quick sobs shaking her breast ,</l>
       <l n="145">Agonised , now , as by death ,</l>
       <l n="146">Fearing utterly , fighting with fate ,</l>
       <l n="147">Stumbling . And swifter behind ,</l>
       <l n="148">With a love made hot by his hate ,</l>
       <l n="149">Strained he pursuing . The wind ,</l>
       <l n="150">Lifted , and played with the fold</l>
       <l n="151">Of her chlamys ; and showed made bare</l>
       <l n="152">The swift limbs shining , as gold</l>
       <l n="153">From sunlight , and streamed through her hair</l>
       <l n="154">As wind in a cresset of fire ,</l>
       <l n="155">As tresses of flame in the night ,</l>
       <l n="156">While she fled , desired , from desire ,</l>
       <l n="157">Till the brakes hid the flame from his sight .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="158">Yea , but no long time he stood ,</l>
       <l n="159">As one who resigns the prize</l>
       <l n="160">When a moment baffled . The wood</l>
       <l n="161">Hid her indeed from his eyes ,</l>
       <l n="162">But the track of her feet lay clean</l>
       <l n="163">As the slot of a deer in the grass .</l>
       <l n="164">Slower he followed , and keen</l>
       <l n="165">Were his downcast eyes . As a glass</l>
       <l n="166">A wide lake gleamed in the ebb</l>
       <l n="167">Of the latest tide of the light ;</l>
       <l n="168">Stars shone clear through the web</l>
       <l n="169">Of the branches , beckoning night ;</l>
       <l n="170">The leaves fell softly , gilt</l>
       <l n="171">With autumn , and tawny and red ;</l>
       <l n="172">And the blue of the skies lay spilt ,</l>
       <l n="173">Pooled , shining , from late rains shed ;</l>
       <l n="174">The tall reeds seemed to dream</l>
       <l n="175">By the full lake 's murmuring marge .</l>
       <l n="176">She paused by a chiming stream ,</l>
       <l n="177">Listened awhile , hung her targe</l>
       <l n="178">From a tree with her unstrung bow ,</l>
       <l n="179">Loosened her breast-plate and greaves ,</l>
       <l n="180">Bathing her limbs : and slow ,</l>
       <l n="181">Like a snake through the fallen leaves ,</l>
       <l n="182">Theseus crept on his prize ,</l>
       <l n="183">Paused , to gaze on her grace ,</l>
       <l n="184">The fine clean curve of the thighs ,</l>
       <l n="185">Pure brow , and well-chiselled face ,</l>
       <l n="186">Beautiful knees , and the play</l>
       <l n="187">Of muscles , splendidly wrought .</l>
       <l n="188">Theseus leapt on his prey .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="189">Laughing softly , he sought</l>
       <l n="190">Ease from desire as a flame :</l>
       <l n="191">Struggled she still , and fought ,</l>
       <l n="192">Calling on Artemis ’ name ,</l>
       <l n="193">Who went , unheeding her prayer ,</l>
       <l n="194">Beyond Tainaros streaming with floods ,</l>
       <l n="195">Till the cries came faint through the air ,</l>
       <l n="196">Dwindling among the woods ,</l>
       <l n="197">For the numberless tongues of the leaves</l>
       <l n="198">Echoed with myriad cries</l>
       <l n="199">Low , and as plaintive as grieves</l>
       <l n="200">The wood under darkening skies .</l>
       <l n="201">The quick , sharp sobs from her breast</l>
       <l n="202">Came thick , and she , to whom spears</l>
       <l n="203">Hurtling close were a zest</l>
       <l n="204">To battle , felt the hot tears</l>
       <l n="205">Well and fall from her eyes ,</l>
       <l n="206">Struggled not long , lay still .</l>
       <l n="207">Theseus stooped on his prize ,</l>
       <l n="208">Drank of her lips his fill .</l>

       <l n="7">A wind of grieving , through the branches wet ,</l>

       <l n="13">Leaves whirled about her passage , with the throng</l>
       <l n="14">Of her lamenting ghosts , who cried regret ,</l>

       <l n="97">To drink of : and I knew how flesh could bound</l>
       <l n="98">Spirit ; so that we lay drowsed , close to sleep ,</l>
       <l n="99">Near as our bodies might , yet sundered thus</l>

       <l n="101">Unborn or buried , meeting with our mouths</l>
       <l n="102">In a swift marriage , and the sacred night</l>

       <l n="115">She peoples all the blue of sea and skies</l>
       <l n="116">With golden hopes of youth , giving them life</l>

       <l n="128">Up from the wreck of day the night 's first star</l>
       <l n="129">Quickening through the silence . So , in her ,</l>

       <l n="131">The splendours of the earth and sky and sea ,</l>

       <l n="150">Bared , while mine eyes drank all the beauty in ,</l>
       <l n="151">As earth drinks dawn with gladness : but her eyes</l>

       <l n="160">She lay there as if dead , and all my love</l>

       <l n="164">Came soft , and warm , through the red parted lips ,</l>
       <l n="165">Fragrant upon my face . That night was filled</l>

       <l n="170">So was she mine , by the sword 's right , whose heart</l>

       <l n="173">Such an one as the hearts of maids desire ,</l>
       <l n="174">Being tall , and straight , and comely : never a man</l>

       <l n="176">His hands were skilful . I can love such men</l>

       <l n="179">Was white and ruddy in the fields and woods ;</l>

       <l n="181">As day was closing , and had spoken low</l>
       <l n="182">In the dim light ; and he had sailed in June</l>
       <l n="183">Southward for prey , descending toward the Seine</l>
       <l n="184">With help from Thrain the White in ships and men .</l>
       <l n="185">And I had come in autumn with my swords</l>
       <l n="186">For vengeance of a wrong , and left Thrain 's stead</l>

       <l n="194">Men came and said , “ Lo , now will Sigurd come</l>
       <l n="195">For love of her , to take her hence again</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="9">

       <l n="202">To mate with , but the one he loves ? ” I struck</l>
       <l n="203">The craven fool a damned blow in the face ,</l>
       <l n="204">Whereat they kept their counsel , and were still .</l>
       <l n="205">But one man , riding over a wild moor</l>
       <l n="206">When the black night was blacker with a storm</l>
       <l n="207">Saw in the play of lightnings from the clouds</l>
       <l n="208">Twelve armoured women riding , and they swooped</l>
       <l n="209">Eagle-wise on the earth , and riding came</l>
       <l n="210">To a lone house ; and , spying through a chink ,</l>
       <l n="211">He saw them weave a scarlet web of war ,</l>
       <l n="212">With swords for shuttles , and men 's heads for weights ,</l>
       <l n="213">And they sang at their weaving . In those days</l>
       <l n="214">We sowed our corn with axes in our belts ,</l>
       <l n="215">And each man armoured , and my people went</l>
       <l n="216">Fearfully , gazing out with anxious eyes</l>
       <l n="217">Over the seas for an unfriendly sail ,</l>
       <l n="218">While I sat silent , eating mine own heart ,</l>
       <l n="219">Until one ran with speed to me , as night</l>
       <l n="220">Came , dropping silence on the shining sea ,</l>
       <l n="221">A man with lucky eyes , who cried , “ They come ! ”</l>
       <l n="222">Pointing toward the rim of ocean , red</l>
       <l n="223">With the sun 's blood ; and that sight gladdened me ,</l>
       <l n="224">To see their slack sails , idle , in a gore</l>
       <l n="225">Of dying glories , while their oars dripped fire ,</l>
       <l n="226">Labouring up against the ebbing tide .</l>
       <l n="227">“ They will come weary , ” said I , “ and , perchance ,</l>
       <l n="228">Lack water . ” And I set an ambush , there</l>
       <l n="229">Where Rangriver turns bitter with the sea ,</l>
       <l n="230">If thirst should lure them ; and they came with skins</l>
       <l n="231">To fill ; and there we played a little while</l>
       <l n="232">With knives and axes , while they ran , and tripped</l>
       <l n="233">Over gnarled roots and boulders in the dark ,</l>
       <l n="234">Calling their friends , and knew not where they ran ,</l>
       <l n="235">For we would call the names we heard them call</l>
       <l n="236">In feigning , and thus lure them from the path .</l>
       <l n="237">Twenty tall fellows slew we in this wise ,</l>
       <l n="238">Making the odds more even , and that night</l>
       <l n="239">They watched their ships , and lit the beach with fires</l>
       <l n="240">So that they might not fight an unseen foe ,</l>
       <l n="241">Who struck them through the darkness . But I went</l>
       <l n="242">Homeward , and to the chamber where she lay</l>
       <l n="243">Sleeping , with tears upon her face ; but sleep</l>
       <l n="244">Had stilled her troubles . As I looked on her ,</l>
       <l n="245">Her breath came softly , like a child 's . I watched ,</l>
       <l n="246">Wondering if death might hold as fair a thing ,</l>
       <l n="247">Hungering , though I would not break her dreams .</l>
       <l n="248">All night I watched her , that mine heart might keep</l>
       <l n="249">One face to dream of through the dark of death</l>
       <l n="250">If he should slay me . Then a sense of dawn</l>
       <l n="251">Stole gradually through the blue , wet air ;</l>
       <l n="252">Cool dawn , with dew and silence , fair and fresh !</l>
       <l n="253">In the white light she lay there , and I looked</l>
       <l n="254">Long on her : and I left her then , and went ,</l>
       <l n="255">Calling my men , and led them thence afield</l>
       <l n="256">To a smooth level sward , for fighting made ,</l>
       <l n="257">Between the gray bents and the leafy woods ,</l>
       <l n="258">A dancing-ground for maidens . Such a stir</l>
       <l n="259">Came from the beached black ships , as April , hears</l>
       <l n="260">About the populous hives , when the blown scents</l>
       <l n="261">Lure , to their garnering , the frugal bees ,</l>
       <l n="262">And they swarm forth : so swarmed upon the shore</l>
       <l n="263">Sigurd 's well-armoured men : some by the fires</l>
       <l n="264">Eating , some buckling on their gleaming arms ,</l>
       <l n="265">Shouting their war-songs , beating on their shields</l>
       <l n="266">Full of rude jests ; and I saw Sigurd there ,</l>
       <l n="267">Standing apart , long-haired , and great of limb ,</l>
       <l n="268">With a soft silken kirtle , and his helm ,</l>
       <l n="269">Winged , flaming in the sunlight . Then my men</l>
       <l n="270">Halted , for vantage of the broken ground ,</l>
       <l n="271">While I strode out upon the sward , and called</l>
       <l n="272">To Sigurd ; but blind rage gat hold of him ,</l>
       <l n="273">And he came at me , whirling his bright axe .</l>
       <l n="274">And I leapt out to meet him , so men say ,</l>
       <l n="275">Laughing , and ran upon him , and his blow</l>
       <l n="276">Broke down my guard , and bit the shoulder-bone ,</l>
       <l n="277">But mine axe clove clean through the angry face ,</l>
       <l n="278">Right to the brain ; and , as I drew it back ,</l>
       <l n="279">He swayed , and fell , and his bronze armour rang</l>
       <l n="280">Loudly ; and from both armies came a shout</l>
       <l n="281">Crying , “ Sigurd is slain ! Sigurd is slain ! ”</l>
       <l n="282">One mourning and one joyous , while my men</l>
       <l n="283">Stood round him prone , and marvelled at his strength ,</l>
       <l n="284">And no one feared him now . But they came on</l>
       <l n="285">Avenging , and the crashing of their shock</l>
       <l n="286">Broke round us ; and the ringing blows , and shouts ,</l>
       <l n="287">And screams of dying men were born aloft</l>
       <l n="288">With dust of battle ; and lightening axes whirled ,</l>
       <l n="289">Lifting and falling : keen , and bright , and blue</l>
       <l n="290">They fell , but they were lifted dull and red ,</l>
       <l n="291">While we rolled backward and forward in waves of fight ,</l>
       <l n="292">And fluctuating chance , and those who fell ,</l>
       <l n="293">Drowned there , amid the press of trampling feet .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="10">
       <l n="294">So , all day long , the uncertain combat flowed ,</l>
       <l n="295">Between the gray bents and the broken ground ;</l>
       <l n="296">And the smooth sward was cumbered with the dead ,</l>
       <l n="297">On whom we stumbled . But at last the night</l>
       <l n="298">Came , shadowing with her blue veils the sea ,</l>
       <l n="299">And we and they drew off ; and when the noise</l>
       <l n="300">Of war was stilled , and only moans of men</l>
       <l n="301">Broke silence , with the laughter of the sea</l>
       <l n="302">That curled , and foamed , and rippled on the beach ,</l>
       <l n="303">I hailed them , and they answered me , and sent</l>
       <l n="304">Tall Flosi , son of Gunnar , their best man</l>
       <l n="305">Since Sigurd fell . Over the level sward ,</l>
       <l n="306">Now with the dead strown thick as shocks of corn</l>
       <l n="307">After a reaping , strode he ; and the moon</l>
       <l n="308">Tipped his bright spear with silver , lit his helm</l>
       <l n="309">And burnished shield ; but when his eyes and mine</l>
       <l n="310">Met , and he knew me , he stood waiting there .</l>
       <l n="311">And I spoke , pointing , with my spear , to those</l>
       <l n="312">White faces staring sightless to the moon</l>
       <l n="313">From the smooth sward : “ Lo ! let us make a truce</l>
       <l n="314">And mourn these dead , for they were goodly men .</l>
       <l n="315">My friends or thine , who lie there strengthless now</l>
       <l n="316">With Sigurd whom I slew . Him men shall mourn</l>
       <l n="317">In Bergthorsknoll , as the bright gods in heaven</l>
       <l n="318">Mourn golden Balder ; but his praise shall be</l>
       <l n="319">Within the hearts and on the lips of men</l>
       <l n="320">A song for ever . Him I hated not ,</l>
       <l n="321">Nay , rather loved ! Though he bore hate to me</l>
       <l n="322">For Swinefell 's spoiling , and for Gudrun 's sake ,</l>
       <l n="323">Her , whom mine eyes beholding , straight mine heart</l>
       <l n="324">Desired with all its strength . So for one prize</l>
       <l n="325">Strove we , nor could we yield , but one must die :</l>
       <l n="326">Whence lies he there . The gods have willed it so !</l>
       <l n="327">But let us build a pyre within his ship</l>
       <l n="328">Heaped up with spoil , and let us mourn for him ,</l>
       <l n="329">And launch him , burning , on the eternal sea .</l>
       <l n="330">And when the dawn of the third day is red ,</l>
       <l n="331">If your mind is for fighting , we shall fight</l>
       <l n="332">Again ; or ye shall launch your ships and go</l>
       <l n="333">Over the bright ways of the shining sea . ”</l>
       <l n="334">I spake , and Flosi answered , gazing down</l>
       <l n="335">Upon the dead , whose armour glimmered there</l>
       <l n="336">Under the shining moon , as glimmer pools</l>
       <l n="337">Innumerable in the leafless woods :</l>
       <l n="338">“ Yea , one slim maid hath slain too many men .</l>

       <l n="344">So loved I him : I count all women light</l>
       <l n="345">As flax beside his loss . Why didst not thou ,</l>

       <l n="347">And mine axe failed me , strike ? ” And I , to him ,</l>
       <l n="348">Impatient , for my wound was cold and irked</l>
       <l n="349">My shoulder : “ Go , and boast among the ships</l>

       <l n="355">In one long sigh ; and he drew in his breath</l>
       <l n="356">Quickly , remembering his brother 's stead</l>
       <l n="357">Above the land-locked bays ; and his heart saw</l>

       <l n="359">With her sweet , patient face , so old and wise ,</l>
       <l n="360">Lit by the flickering firelight . Thus he stood ,</l>
       <l n="361">Forgetting war and death ; and when he spoke</l>
       <l n="362">Again , his voice was changed , and soft in speech ,</l>
       <l n="363">While we went down toward the twinkling fires</l>
       <l n="364">That lit the shore , and set a watch with brands</l>
       <l n="365">To scare the wolves , who barked within the woods ,</l>
       <l n="366">Snuffing the tainted air . And Flosi came ,</l>
       <l n="367">Alone of all the Jarls , up to mine house ,</l>
       <l n="368">While they abode there . And when dawn was red</l>
       <l n="369">Upon the third day , launching their black ships ,</l>
       <l n="370">They went upon the bright ways of the sea .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="12">
       <l n="371">Softly the sails dropped down that sea of light</l>
       <l n="372">Under the milky skies ; all liquid gold</l>
       <l n="373">The pure fire broken by the cleaving prows</l>
       <l n="374">And whitening in their wake ; as I watched them</l>
       <l n="375">I thought all life went thus , man 's voyaging heart ,</l>
       <l n="376">Over the loud , glad , golden ways of time .</l>
       <l n="377">With oars taught by a song , to seek some joy ,</l>
       <l n="378">Some rapture , some warm isle in happy seas ,</l>
       <l n="379">Adventuring . A lure there is for us</l>
       <l n="380">In far horizons , dreamed-of , misty lands .</l>
       <l n="381">A voice that calls us . Yea , but look on love !</l>
       <l n="382">She lay there who , but two nights past , had watched</l>
       <l n="383">One burning ship drift over the sea 's rim</l>
       <l n="384">Into the dark . Was she not mine indeed ,</l>
       <l n="385">Now , whom mine arm had won ? All mine ! all mine !</l>
       <l n="386">The long , bright braids of hair ; the little breasts ,</l>
       <l n="387">Like cups of carven ivory ; the smooth ,</l>
       <l n="388">Cool , marble whiteness ; curves one knew by touch</l>
       <l n="389">Only , too gradual for eyes : it seemed</l>
       <l n="390">God 's hands , there , had felt joy in them , and wrought</l>
       <l n="391">Delighting : and the blue eyes , brimmed with light ;</l>
       <l n="392">And thee , my son , forged in the intense hour 's flame</l>
       <l n="393">And inmost heat of whiteness . Mine ! all mine !</l>
       <l n="394">All mine : and yet some shadow slipped from me ,</l>
       <l n="395">Some frail , soft , sweet , intangible delight</l>
       <l n="396">Escaping from mine hands . So have I gone</l>
       <l n="397">Over blue windless seas , bare of all life ,</l>
       <l n="398">And urged the labouring oars ; but every dawn</l>
       <l n="399">Showed still the same blue , stainless shield , whose boss</l>
       <l n="400">Was our one ship , until it hushed our songs ,</l>
       <l n="401">That deep , vast , desolating blue of sky</l>
       <l n="402">And tranquil waters . I had all of her</l>
       <l n="403">But some few drops of joy she yielded not ,</l>
       <l n="404">They being hers to give or keep , a dew</l>
       <l n="405">Distilled within her soul . Yea , I loved her !</l>
       <l n="406">I think no love is peace , and we but break</l>
       <l n="407">Against each other ; and our hands are vain</l>
       <l n="408">To grasp what is worth holding ; and our sense</l>
       <l n="409">Too coarse a net to snare what no speech saith ,</l>
       <l n="410">We go alone through all our days , alone</l>
       <l n="411">Even when all is given ! But him she loved ;</l>
       <l n="412">And dreamed upon his face , remembering .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="13">
       <l n="413">Even so , I am glad ! Yea , all my heart is glad</l>
       <l n="414">I had her for mine own . I grasped the joy ,</l>
       <l n="415">The quick , warm , breathing life ; and if the dream</l>
       <l n="416">Fled from me , yet mine hands held priceless things ,</l>
       <l n="417">And dreams are winged to fly . They are poor fools</l>
       <l n="418">Who deem the better love is a bowed heart</l>
       <l n="419">And silent lips . If thou hadst beauty close ,</l>
       <l n="420">Because the white bird fluttered on thy breast ,</l>
       <l n="421">Wouldst loose it ? Or would not a quicker pulse</l>
       <l n="422">Beat in thine heart , and eager fingers close</l>
       <l n="423">More firmly on the snowy , ruffled plumes ,</l>
       <l n="424">Till the thing yielded , panting ? Will ye win ?</l>
       <l n="425">Then must ye dare . There is a lean saint stalled</l>
       <l n="426">Somewhere among my scullions , in the stead :</l>
       <l n="427">A half-drowned rat we haled from out the sea ,</l>
       <l n="428">Who says God saved him ! He stakes his poor life ,</l>
       <l n="429">Having not strength enough to lift mine axe ,</l>
       <l n="430">Against a greater glory . Love to him</l>
       <l n="431">Is as a golden net to snare his feet ,</l>
       <l n="432">And women perilous lures : he would keep them maids ,</l>
       <l n="433">Nor make one mother , but would rather see</l>
       <l n="434">Life , which the gods made lovely , fade and die</l>
       <l n="435">Ashen as winter woods , nor break again</l>
       <l n="436">In all the foaming blossom of the spring ,</l>
       <l n="437">Whitening every field . He never knew</l>
       <l n="438">The keen , sweet joy that smites through every sense</l>
       <l n="439">Into the shuddering soul , and whelms the world</l>
       <l n="440">In an immortal glory , while God builds</l>
       <l n="441">Life beyond us , creating out of clay</l>
       <l n="442">The world 's imperishable dream , the hope ,</l>
       <l n="443">The wonder , the desire , that gives us sight</l>
       <l n="444">Beyond our mortal doom . I have little wit ;</l>
       <l n="445">I only know that in the looms of time</l>
       <l n="446">God 's will moves like a shuttle to and fro .</l>
       <l n="447">I have heard him in the waves , and on the wind ;</l>
       <l n="448">I have seen his splendour shine among the swords ,</l>
       <l n="449">Soften the eyes of women , light and smile</l>
       <l n="450">On a child 's lips ; and know his presence there</l>
       <l n="451">Where all the waves stream eagerly to lick</l>
       <l n="452">The sunset 's bloody splendours . Balder , the bright</l>
       <l n="453">Beautiful Balder , whose eyes hold our hope ,</l>
       <l n="454">Who hath made love a light , and life a song ,</l>
       <l n="455">In all men 's eyes , and on their lips , who hath sown</l>
       <l n="456">The fields of heaven thick with golden fires ,</l>
       <l n="457">As men sow corn : and forges in this flame ,</l>
       <l n="458">Of life , with ringing blows , a strong man 's soul</l>
       <l n="459">As swords are fashioned , keen-edged , straight , and blue ,</l>
       <l n="460">How shall I die dispraising thee , whose praise</l>
       <l n="461">Comes , laden with the blown scents of the spring ,</l>
       <l n="462">Opening dewy eyelids of bright buds ,</l>
       <l n="463">And brings the swallows ? Thee I will not curse ,</l>
       <l n="464">Nor life , nor women , nor the fool himself</l>
       <l n="465">Who blinks weak eyes , and calls the glory vain .</l>

       <l n="466">The sea is darkened now ; and I can hear</l>

       <l n="471">Nay , one drowns here in death ; and why not there</l>

       <l n="489">When a low , yellow moon lights up a land</l>
       <l n="490">Full of ripe stooks . Now it is time to go ,</l>

     <p>“ Son imagination , sa curiosite amusee , son erudition lui donnent cette tournure d'esprit et cette originalite d'expression qui nous seduisent si particulierement chez M. Remy de Gourmont . ” Mercure de France .</p>
     <p>“ Since Mr. Arnold , there has been no such ironist in this country as the author of ‘ Scenes and Portraits . ’ Irony is not an English quality ; and Mr. Manning 's is distinctly not an English book . It is Latin in its intelligence , in its disregard of consequences , in its presentation of the pure idea . If Lucian , Landor , Renan , and Anatole France could have collaborated , the result would have been some such work as this . ” — Edinburgh Review , October 1909 .</p>
     <p>“ They have a curious originality , and , though fantastic in the extreme , are always singularly alert and attractive . They will be welcomed because they contain much that is fresh and unexpected and stimulating . ” — Observer .</p>

      <head>THE VIGIL OF BRUNHILD</head>
       <l n="1">A NARRATIVE POEM , IN BLANK VERSE</l>
       <l n="2">Crown 8vo . 2s . 6d . net</l>
     </lg>
     <p>The name of Brunhild raises memories of tragedy , of her rivalry with the murderous Fredegonde , and of her cruel death by wild horses . But , though she is one of the greatest figures in early French history , she has never been celebrated , so far as is known , in English poetry ; nor has she received the honour she deserves from her own countrymen .</p>
     <p>In this poem the author refrains from any sensational description of her end . Brunhild is represented as giving an account of her life and of its high political aims in blank verse of a high standard , which is worthy of her romantic life and of her coloured history .</p>

     <p>“ To spend an evening with Mr. Newbolt 's little volume brings a rare refreshment to the spirit . There is a quality in his verse which braces the reader up with a sweet , winning freshness , just as a morning breeze will cheer the tramper over an upland within sight of the sea .

     <p>“ This brilliant historical novel .... Its style is so distinguished ; it is so skilfully interlarded with mediaevalisms . It reads as if it were an old chronicle ; it is full of the quaint people of the Middle Ages , with their pointed shoes and fur-edged robes ; it is full of the unruly youth of the thirteenth century .... ‘ On the Forgotten Road ’ has the flavour of Giotto in its pages . ” — Queen .</p>

It consists of original sketches and of translations from the Irish , and from beginning to end the atmosphere , which is delightful , is the same ....

     <p>“ Lady Gregory has added another leaf to the crown of laurel she is winning by her studies in ancient Gaelic folk-lore and legend . Her ‘ Gods and Fighting Men ’ is as naively delightful , as mentally refreshing and invigorating as her previous books .... She is at heart a poet , and the limitless wealth of imagination of the Irish mind , its quaintness and simplicity , its gravity and peculiar humour , have passed into her possession and inspired her pen to fine issues . ” — Yorkshire Post .</p>
