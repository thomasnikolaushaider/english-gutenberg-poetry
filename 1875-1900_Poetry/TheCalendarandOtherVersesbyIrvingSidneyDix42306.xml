    <docTitle><titlePart>The Calendar and Other Verses by Irving Sidney Dix To Robert Meaker Dear boy , ten summers — ten swift summers now Have come and gone since last I said good-bye , Ten idle , wasted summers gone , and how I hardly know , so swift the seasons fly : So swift the seasons come , so swift they go , That scare it seems one brief , one little day , Since boyish voices bid us come and play : And little girls did seem to lure us so . O Robert !— Robert !— If in Paradise These idle words of mine can penetrate , Thou knowest , then , that tears have wet mine eyes , Thou knowest that I felt thy ruthless fate ; And yet , dear boy , I sometimes feel that thou Art happier there than I who mourn thee now .</titlePart></docTitle>

    <head>Foreword</head>
    <p n="1">About a year ago , having collected all those poems and verses which I considered of any value , I took a certain pride in the thought that I might soon bring under one roof these imaginary children of mine , so that they might be sheltered in time of storm , as it were , from the cold , and oftimes unfeeling world of commerce but where friends of poetry , who had met with some of my stray children of verse in public journals , might meet with them again , if they desired , with other friendly faces around one common fireside .</p>
    <p n="2">But I found that the expense incident to such a venture was so great that unless a large number of copies were sold I would be involved in a larger debt than I cared to contract . Then the plan of securing sufficient advance subscriptions to meet part of the expense of a first edition occurred to me , thereby following the method of Tennyson , Robert Burns and others , of whose example I needed not to be ashamed , but other work prevented me , and still prevents me , from carrying out this plan .</p>
    <p n="3">So lest those friends who have shown an interest in my verses should think that I have turned aside from the Path of Poetry , I herewith offer “ The Calendar and Other Verses , ” as evidence of my love for and interest in the greatest of all the arts , hoping that the time may come when I shall be able to present a more worthy offering to the Muses and perhaps justify the kind words that have recently appeared in regards to the author of “ The Quiet Life ” — A Plain Poem of the Hills , which , in a revised form , appeared serially during the past summer in The Wayne Countean .</p>

      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">Come walk a mile with me — ‘ Tis January ;</l>
       <l n="2">The knee-deep snow lies heavy on the ground</l>
       <l n="3">And hark !— the icy winds — how swift they hurry</l>
       <l n="4">Over the fields with melancholy sound ;</l>
       <l n="5">And save these winds or some forsaken raven ,</l>
       <l n="6">Winging its way along yon frozen hill ,</l>
       <l n="7">Nature is hush 'd — her dormant image graven</l>
       <l n="8">In marble masks on woodland , lake and rill .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="9">And look !— the trees their naked trunks are swaying ,</l>
       <l n="10">As bitterly each blast goes howling by ,</l>
       <l n="11">And hark !— the music in the hemlocks playing ,</l>
       <l n="12">Like some lost spirit banished from the sky ,</l>
       <l n="13">And see the smoke from yonder chimney curling ,</l>
       <l n="14">Hugs the broad roofs , deep-burden 'd with the snow ,</l>
       <l n="15">While clouds of snow are round the low eaves whirling .</l>
       <l n="16">How cold it is !— Come , let us homeward go</l>
       <l n="17">There will we find the cheerful fire still burning ,</l>
       <l n="18">There ruddy warmth will make our faces glow ,</l>
       <l n="19">And there kind hearts will welcome our returning ;</l>
       <l n="20">Come !— let us hasten through the drifty snow .</l>

      <head>FEBRUARY .</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">Come walk a mile with me — ‘ Tis February ;</l>
       <l n="2">The sun is creeping slowly toward the North ,</l>
       <l n="3">And every breeze to-day seems blithe and merry ,</l>
       <l n="4">And prophets of the Spring are waking forth —</l>
       <l n="5">The hungry ground-hog casts a thin , gray shadow</l>
       <l n="6">Beside his open villa , dark and cold ,</l>
       <l n="7">And the starv 'd hare surveys the icy meadow ,</l>
       <l n="8">And chipmonks chatter in the leafless wold .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="9">And hark !— the blue-jay 's fife is sounding shrilly ,</l>
       <l n="10">And merry chickadees are piping loud ,</l>
       <l n="11">E'en though the bitter North-wind 's breath is chilly ,</l>
       <l n="12">And the great trees are low before him bow 'd ;</l>
       <l n="13">And see !— the Lady of the South is creeping</l>
       <l n="14">Higher and higher — ‘ Tis the hour of noon ,</l>
       <l n="15">And sad-eyed Winter by yon brook is weeping ,—</l>
       <l n="16">Yon little brook that sings a pleasant tune .</l>
       <l n="17">Yet , as the sun is with the day declining ,</l>
       <l n="18">Swift , darkening clouds are gathering in the West ,</l>
       <l n="19">Where the snow-fairies are again designing</l>
       <l n="20">Another robe for Nature 's barren breast .</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <lg type="poem">
      <head>MARCH .</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">Come walk a mile with me — ‘ Tis March and windy ,</l>
       <l n="2">And Winter 's dying breath comes hard and fast ,</l>
       <l n="3">And hark !— the storm , like death-bells of a Sunday ,</l>
       <l n="4">Tolls the sad knell upon the icy blast ;</l>
       <l n="5">Louder and louder now the winds are wailing ,</l>
       <l n="6">Faster and faster wings the frozen snow ,</l>
       <l n="7">Darker and darker the cold clouds are sailing ,</l>
       <l n="8">As the March-storm goes hurrying to and fro .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="9">But see !— the sun above the clouds is creeping ,</l>
       <l n="10">And look !— soft flakes are falling , one by one ,</l>
       <l n="11">And Winter , pale in death , lies gently sleeping ,</l>
       <l n="12">While Spring awakes e'er half the day is done .</l>
       <l n="13">And soon the sun , like some great hearth is burning ,</l>
       <l n="14">Melting the ghosts of Winter on the hills ,</l>
       <l n="15">And hark !— the robin from the South returning ,</l>
       <l n="16">Joins the glad music of the murmuring rills ,</l>
       <l n="17">And now the farmer-boy , whose heart is leaping ,</l>
       <l n="18">Gathers the sap that sings a merry song ,</l>
       <l n="19">While the blue-birds sweet melodies are keeping ,</l>
       <l n="20">And noisy squirrels leap the trees among .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">Come walk a mile with me — ‘ Tis April weather ;</l>
       <l n="2">A voice like Spring is calling : Let us go</l>
       <l n="3">Where violets are blooming on the heather ,</l>
       <l n="4">And song-birds bend the branches to and fro ;</l>
       <l n="5">For everywhere the very ground is springing ,</l>
       <l n="6">And everywhere the grass is getting green —</l>
       <l n="7">How can I now — how can I keep from singing</l>
       <l n="8">When all the world is like a fairy scene !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="9">The buds in all the trees , are ripe for bursting ,</l>
       <l n="10">And fleecy catkins flutter everywhere ,</l>
       <l n="11">And every little flower seems a-thirsting</l>
       <l n="12">For something sweet and beautiful and fair .</l>
       <l n="13">But look !— to Westward — see !— an April shower</l>
       <l n="14">Sudden has gathered , darkening the sun ,</l>
       <l n="15">Yet wait !— beside me lifts a gentle flower ,</l>
       <l n="16">That lights my pathway , blossoming alone ;</l>
       <l n="17">And hark !— O hark , the meadow-lark is singing ,</l>
       <l n="18">Greeting the storm from yon tall maple tree ,</l>
       <l n="19">While , like a herald in its homeward winging ,</l>
       <l n="20">Wheels a lone flicker o'er the darkening lea .</l>

       <l n="1">Come walk a mile with me — ‘ Tis merry May-time ;</l>
       <l n="2">The little lambs are gamboling on the green ,—</l>
       <l n="3">Nature is glad — it is her hour of playtime ,</l>
       <l n="4">And now , or never , her true heart is seen ;</l>
       <l n="5">The butterflies are floating down from heaven ,</l>
       <l n="6">And humming-birds again are on the wing ,—</l>
       <l n="7">And the kind swallows , seventy times seven ,</l>
       <l n="8">Fill all the air with merry murmuring .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="9">And see the lilacs by yon cottage blooming !—</l>
       <l n="10">How sweet the air is !— sweetness everywhere ,</l>
       <l n="11">For look !— rich apple-blossoms are perfuming</l>
       <l n="12">This little lane that leads to woodlands fair ,—</l>
       <l n="13">Here honeysuckle-bells are softly swinging ,</l>
       <l n="14">And pink azaleas perfume all the wood ,</l>
       <l n="15">And , in the trees , the vireos are singing</l>
       <l n="16">Incessantly their songs of solitude ,</l>
       <l n="17">While round the hill , as slow our steps are wending ,</l>
       <l n="18">We hear a sweet Voice calling ,— “ Come , O come ! ”</l>
       <l n="19">For see !— the sun is in the West decending ,</l>
       <l n="20">And happy hearts are waiting us at home .</l>

       <l n="4">From a young swallow loosen 'd in its flight ;</l>
       <l n="5">But hark !— in yonder broad and sunlit meadow</l>
       <l n="6">The sound of busy mowers fill the air ,</l>
       <l n="7">While from a tree that casts a pleasing shadow ,</l>
       <l n="8">Is heard the locust piping shrilly there .</l>

      <head>THE SCHOOL OF LIFE</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">Life is a school , and all that tread the earth</l>
       <l n="2">Are pupils in it . Its lessons all should learn ,</l>
       <l n="3">And few there be who escape them — and they are fools .</l>
       <l n="4">At birth this school begins , at death it ends ,</l>
       <l n="5">And many terms there be ,— and faithful teachers</l>
       <l n="6">Not a few . Necessity is one ;</l>
       <l n="7">For e'en the babe when first it feels the cool</l>
       <l n="8">And earthly air , and sees the light of day ,</l>
       <l n="9">Shrinks from their touch , and cries aloud — herewith</l>
       <l n="10">It doth begin to learn the alphabet</l>
       <l n="11">Of life . Then hunger comes ; and so to ease</l>
       <l n="12">Itself the babe doth learn to love the things</l>
       <l n="13">That give it life . Thus hour by hour , and day</l>
       <l n="14">By day it gathers knowledge at the school</l>
       <l n="15">But knows it not — even as wiser men ,</l>
       <l n="16">Of knowledge full , know scarcely what they do .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="17">And months pass by — the babe becomes a child ,</l>
       <l n="18">Eager to learn , to imitate , to know ,</l>
       <l n="19">Lisping the lessons of a higher grade ,</l>
       <l n="20">Repeating words of wisdom , gems of truth</l>
       <l n="21">That others think the little thing should know ;</l>
       <l n="22">Until at length in childish innocence</l>
       <l n="23">It leaves the kindergarten of the world ,</l>
       <l n="24">And knocks upon the door of adult life ,</l>
       <l n="25">And enters there , flushed with the lulling sense</l>
       <l n="26">Of something new . The playthings are forgot ;</l>
       <l n="27">The little bells no longer please the ear ,</l>
       <l n="28">The little books no longer feed the mind ,</l>
       <l n="29">The little seats no longer suit the child ,</l>
       <l n="30">The little friends no longer stir the soul ,</l>

       <l n="32">And put aside the primer once for all .</l>
       <l n="33">There is a longing now for deeper life</l>

       <l n="36">When , for the first , they feel a larger life</l>
       <l n="37">In unison close beating to its own —</l>
       <l n="38">There is a hatred of authority</l>
       <l n="39">And of restraint — a satisfaction now</l>
       <l n="40">As of a soul enamoured with itself ,</l>
       <l n="41">A soul insolvent on the rising tide</l>
       <l n="42">Of pure existence , with such a stubborness</l>

       <l n="48">By surging hopes , by sudden , deep desires ,</l>
       <l n="49">By wild ambitions and a thousand things ,</l>
       <l n="50">Unnamed and nameless — rivulets of life</l>
       <l n="51">That ever empty in this stirring stream .</l>
       <l n="52">Now would the student leave his school , and play</l>
       <l n="53">Among the hills , or in the valley 's shade ,—</l>
       <l n="54">Now would the scholar chafe at books</l>
       <l n="55">And knowledge and authority — rough banks</l>
       <l n="56">That , like a dyke , hold in life 's mighty stream</l>
       <l n="57">Until the floods of Springtime can abate ,</l>
       <l n="58">And in a clearer , safer channel course again .</l>

       <l n="63">To give advice to those who should advise ;</l>
       <l n="64">Forth full of wisdom would he quickly go ,</l>
       <l n="65">And even issue take with all the world ,</l>
       <l n="66">But when this truant-fever runs its course ,</l>
       <l n="67">This hey-day of existence has its turn ,</l>
       <l n="68">Back to the school the skulking scholar comes ,</l>
       <l n="69">Like a whipped cur , and willing to be taught</l>
       <l n="70">By those same teachers he so lately spurn 'd ,</l>
       <l n="71">And left for larger things .</l>
       <l n="72">For manhood now</l>
       <l n="73">Is here — the errors and the follies , everyone ,</l>
       <l n="74">By the wise student surely now are seen ,</l>
       <l n="75">And in the book of life he reads with ready eye</l>
       <l n="76">The rules and lessons , and considers well</l>
       <l n="77">His bold instructors ,— Want ,— Adversity ,—</l>
       <l n="78">And Disappointment , with her heavy hand ;</l>
       <l n="79">The whip of Scorn , and Sorrow 's bitter book ,</l>
       <l n="80">And Sickness ’ long and tedious term ,</l>
       <l n="81">And all the various teachers of the school .</l>
       <l n="82">And if perchance these lessons be forgot ,</l>
       <l n="83">These , his instructors , will rehearse him well ,</l>
       <l n="84">Lest he forget in later life these things ,</l>
       <l n="85">And be a dullard in the school of schools ,</l>
