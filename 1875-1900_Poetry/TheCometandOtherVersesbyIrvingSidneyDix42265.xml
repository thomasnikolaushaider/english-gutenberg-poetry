     <p>DEDICATION To the Memory of my school mate William Morgan who was drowned in the Delaware . Press of Munn 's Review Carbondale , Penna . With the Reader</p>
    </epigraph>
    <docImprint>It should be stated that some of these verses , in a slightly different form , have previously appeared in various periodicals in Binghamton , Scranton ,<settlement>Philadelphia</settlement>and<settlement>New York</settlement>City , but most of them appear here for the first time , and also , perhaps it should be mentioned that some of these stanzas were written during my school days . However , the majority of the following verses have been composed since the former booklet was published . And if in any way you have been helped to see , that even here in this rugged country “ the poetry of earth is never ceasing , ” however rude my interpretation of it may seem to the critical , the labor and expense of publishing this little volume will be fully justified .</docImprint>

     <p>ADVERTISEMENT The Comet — 15 cents The Silent Life — 15 cents Both Booklets — 25 cents</p>
    </epigraph>
    <docImprint>These booklets are not published as a financial venture — they are likely to be a failure in this direction , for the cost of printing alone equals the selling price , on account of the small number issued , only 250 copies , and fifty copies are not for sale . Five hundred copies of the Silent Life were printed in<date>1907</date>, and I have left only 160 copies for sale . I desire to dispose of these and the small edition of “ The Comet ” during the present year , so that another booklet ( containing , I hope still better material ) may be issued during the year of<date>1911</date>. To those who may wish to send copies of either of these booklets to their friends , thereby assisting in the disposal of this edition , the following offer will be of interest . Ten copies , assorted to suit —$ 1. 00 .</docImprint>

   <div type="introduction">
    <head>Foreword</head>
    <p n="1">A few years ago , while recovering from an illness , I conceived the idea of writing some reminiscent lines on country life in the Wayne Highlands . And during the interval of a few days I produced some five hundred couplets ,— a few good , some bad and many indifferent — and such speed would of necessity invite the indifferent . A portion of these lines were published in 1907 . However , I had hoped to revise and republish them , with additions of the same type , at a later date as a souvenir volume of verses for those who spend the summer months among these hills — as well as for the home-fast inhabitants . But in substituting the following collection of verses I hope my judgment will be confirmed by those who chance to read these simple stanzas of one , who —</p>
    <p n="2">“ Loves not man the less , but Nature more From those our interviews , in which I steal From all I may be or have been before , To mingle with the Universe and feel What I can ne'er express , yet cannot all conceal . ”</p>

       <l n="1">Swift circuit-rider of the endless skies ,</l>
       <l n="2">Thou wanderer of the outer , unknown air ,</l>
       <l n="3">Amid those dim , uncharted regions there ,</l>
       <l n="4">Imagination droops — in deep surprise</l>
       <l n="5">Man doth behold thee , and the fearful speed</l>
       <l n="6">At which thou spurrest on thy flaming steed .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="7">Born of the dark and ever-deepening Past ,</l>
       <l n="8">Who nurs 'd thee there in yonder viewless space</l>
       <l n="9">Afar from earth — thy all-beholding face</l>
       <l n="10">Hath gazed unspeakable , with clear eye cast</l>
       <l n="11">Worldward on each magnificent return</l>
       <l n="12">As if of human progress thou wouldst learn .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="13">And thou hast seen each triumph and each plan</l>
       <l n="14">By which the human race since human time</l>
       <l n="15">Hath learned at last Earth 's secrets all-sublime</l>
       <l n="16">While rising from the elements to man —</l>
       <l n="17">Hast seen it triumph over sea and air</l>
       <l n="18">And universal knowledge hope to share .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="19">Thy circuit measures well the age of man ,</l>
       <l n="20">The epoch of a life — and few there be</l>
       <l n="21">Who seeing thee , thy face again may see ,</l>
       <l n="22">For human life is but a little span ,</l>
       <l n="23">With varying cycles of a different day ,</l>
       <l n="24">And in diffusion wears itself away .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="25">Child of the Sun , when first the human eye</l>
       <l n="26">Beheld thee coursing in the night afar</l>
       <l n="27">Like an illumined spectre of a star —</l>
       <l n="28">Beheld thy awful form against the sky</l>
       <l n="29">Strong men fell earthward with a coward-cry</l>
       <l n="30">On their pale lips , as if afraid to die —</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="31">And that brute King — Nero , the cruel King ,</l>
       <l n="32">When looking on thy fiery face unknown ,</l>
       <l n="33">Sate trembling on his little human throne ,</l>
       <l n="34">And thought that thou didst evil tidings bring —</l>
       <l n="35">That thou wert writing on the distant skies</l>
       <l n="36">A doom from which no human king could rise .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="37">Thy age is all unknown — man can but guess</l>
       <l n="38">The time when first the Sun thy circle set —</l>
       <l n="39">He can but guess thy secret birth — and yet</l>
       <l n="40">Observing thee his knowledge is not less ;</l>
       <l n="41">He knows each cycle , each return to be</l>
       <l n="42">A moment in that vast eternity .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="43">Recording-comet of th ’ immortal space ,</l>
       <l n="44">What history thy eye hath look 'd upon</l>
       <l n="45">Since first thy airy , circling course was run !</l>
       <l n="46">What fallen pride ! What scatterings of race !</l>
       <l n="47">Jerusalem and Nineveh and Rome</l>
       <l n="48">Didst thou behold from thy almighty dome —</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="9">
       <l n="49">Didst thou behold — their birth , their rise , their fall —</l>
       <l n="50">Low humbled by the under hordes at last ,</l>
       <l n="51">With glory and fair triumphs in the past ,</l>
       <l n="52">And footprints of destruction over all .</l>
       <l n="53">While thou , fleet comet , with a light divine</l>
       <l n="54">Continueth upon the earth to shine .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="10">
       <l n="55">Speed on ! swift comet — turn , wanderer , turn !</l>
       <l n="56">And with thy flaming , god-like pen of light</l>
       <l n="57">On heaven 's scroll with burning letters write :</l>
       <l n="58">Live but to love , O earth !— to love and learn ,</l>
       <l n="59">For while a comet 's mighty cycles fail ,</l>

       <l n="1">Washington</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="2">It is forever so — when there is need</l>
       <l n="3">Of some clear , clarion voice to forward lead</l>
       <l n="4">God raiseth up a man from his own seed ;</l>
       <l n="5">Not from the soft , luxurious lap of earth ,</l>
       <l n="6">But from a nobler soil , so that from birth</l>
       <l n="7">The frame is moulded with a chosen food</l>
       <l n="8">That has one only end — to make it good ,</l>
       <l n="9">Full generous , far-sighted , firm and keen ,</l>
       <l n="10">With strength to rise above the gross and mean —</l>
       <l n="11">The sordid selfishness that like a curse</l>
       <l n="12">Drives from the heart the virtues it would nurse —</l>
       <l n="13">That love of country , freedom 's holy cause ,</l>
       <l n="14">Justice , mercy , that eye for equal laws ,</l>
       <l n="15">Faith in the future and our fellow-men ,</l>
       <l n="16">Faith in the sword when shielded by the pen —</l>
       <l n="17">And so it was with us — when there was need</l>
       <l n="18">Of one commanding voice to forward lead ,</l>
       <l n="19">God rais 'd up here a man from His own seed ;</l>
       <l n="20">And so came forth the gentle Washington ,</l>
       <l n="21">Fair child of Fate , the nation 's noblest son ,</l>
       <l n="22">Whom Virtue fostered and whom Virtue won .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="23">Some few there be whose feet knew rougher ground ,</l>
       <l n="24">But few indeed a loftier summit found —</l>
       <l n="25">Nurtured in tender soil , he held a path</l>
       <l n="26">Where others faltered , heeding not the wrath</l>
       <l n="27">Of any king or potentate or power —</l>
       <l n="28">His was the hero-heart — he saw the hour ,—</l>
       <l n="29">He knew the mighty odds , yet would not cower .</l>
       <l n="30">And when the tyrant 's heel touch 'd on our shore</l>
       <l n="31">And thrust itself unbidden to our door ,—</l>
       <l n="32">But Washington alone with eagle-eye</l>
       <l n="33">Withstood the foe and taught him how to die ;</l>
       <l n="34">Repulsed , disheartened , driven to despair ,</l>
       <l n="35">He lifted up his voice in humble prayer ,</l>
       <l n="36">For in that awful night at Valley Forge</l>
       <l n="37">He drank the bitter cup — he knew Fate 's scourge ,</l>
       <l n="38">He felt her lash ,— this tender-hearted George .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="39">Father of Liberty — thou Child of Light ,</l>
       <l n="40">Columbia 's first-born , who in thy might</l>
       <l n="41">Restored to Freedom her enfeebled sight —</l>
       <l n="42">If spirits of the nobler dead can hear ,</l>
       <l n="43">This day — thy natal day — press close thine ear</l>
       <l n="44">And learn what we thy nation need to fear ,</l>
       <l n="45">And if the immortal dead can truly speak ,</l>
       <l n="46">Show us , O Child of Light , where we are weak ,—</l>
       <l n="47">Grant us thy counsel ( for thou art with God )</l>
       <l n="48">And bear us wisdom where thy footsteps trod ,</l>
       <l n="49">And if thou seest aught of envious strife</l>
       <l n="50">From virtue sapping all her sweeter life ,</l>
       <l n="51">Teach us , O Child of Light , a purer love ,</l>
       <l n="52">For thou hast learn 'd of God — thou art above</l>
       <l n="53">Thy weak and erring mortals here below</l>
       <l n="54">Who see the light , yet forward fear to go —</l>
       <l n="55">Guide us , if spirits of the dead may guide ,</l>
       <l n="56">So that in peace we ever may abide ,</l>
       <l n="57">So that from land to sea , from shore to shore ,</l>
       <l n="58">We shall be brothers now and evermore .</l>
