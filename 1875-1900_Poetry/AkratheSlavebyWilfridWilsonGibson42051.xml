    <docTitle><titlePart>AKRA THE SLAVE BY WILFRID WILSON GIBSON</titlePart></docTitle>
    <docImprint><settlement>LONDON</settlement>ELKIN MATHEWS , VIGO STREET MCMX Six years ago , I wrote this story down , While yet the light of Eastern skies Was in my eyes , And still my heart , aglow with memories Of sun-enraptured seas , And that old sea-girt town . Where , down dark alleys of enchanted night , We stole , until we came To where the great dome glimmered white . And every minaret , A shaft of pearly flame , Beneath the cloudy moon ... Six years ago ! Ah ! soon — too soon , Our tale , too , will be told : And yet , and yet , From this old Eastern tale we know , Love 's story never can grow old , Till Love , himself , forget .</docImprint>

     <l n="2">He thought to see me tremble</l>
     <l n="3">And totter as an oar-snapt reed ,</l>
     <l n="4">When he spake death to me —</l>
     <l n="5">My courage , toppled in the dust ,</l>
     <l n="6">Even as the head of cactus</l>
     <l n="7">The camel-keeper slashes</l>
     <l n="8">That his beasts may browse , unscathed ,</l>
     <l n="9">The succulent , wounded green .</l>
     <l n="10">He thought to have me , broken ,</l>
     <l n="11">And grovelling at his feet ;</l>
     <l n="12">Mouthing and mumbling to his sandal-ties ,</l>
     <l n="13">In stammering dread of death —</l>
     <l n="14">Aye ! even as a king ,</l>
     <l n="15">Who , having from death 's hand ,</l>
     <l n="16">Received his crown and kingdom ,</l>
     <l n="17">For ever treads in terror of the hour</l>
     <l n="18">When death shall jog his elbow ,</l>
     <l n="19">Twitch the purple from his shoulders ,</l>
     <l n="20">And claim again the borrowed crown .</l>
     <l n="21">But , little need have I to fear</l>
     <l n="22">The crouching , lean camp-follower ,</l>
     <l n="23">Unto whose ever-gaping maw ,</l>
     <l n="24">Day after day , I flung</l>
     <l n="25">The spoils of bow and arrow ,</l>
     <l n="26">Ere I was taken captive —</l>
     <l n="27">I , who have often , at my mother 's breast ,</l>
     <l n="28">Awakened in the night-time ,</l>
     <l n="29">To see death leering on me from the cave-mouth ,</l>
     <l n="30">A gaunt and slinking shape</l>
     <l n="31">That snuffed the dying embers ,</l>
     <l n="32">Blotting out the friendly stars —</l>
     <l n="33">I , who , a scarce-weaned boy ,</l>
     <l n="34">Have toddled , gay and fearless ,</l>
     <l n="35">Down the narrow jungle-track ,</l>
     <l n="36">Through bodeful forest-darkness , panther-eyed ;</l>
     <l n="37">And have felt cold snakes uncoiling</l>
     <l n="38">And gliding ‘ neath my naked sole ,</l>
     <l n="39">From clammy slumber startled ;</l>
     <l n="40">While , with sharp snap and crackle ,</l>
     <l n="41">Beast-trodden branches strained behind me ,</l>
     <l n="42">My father 's hand scarce snatching me</l>
     <l n="43">Before the spring of crouching death !</l>
     <l n="44">But , naught of this the King could know ,</l>
     <l n="45">He only knew that , on that far-off morning ,</l>
     <l n="46">When first I came before him , captive ,</l>
     <l n="47">Among my captive brothers ,</l>
     <l n="48">And , as he lightly held , in idle fingers ,</l>
     <l n="49">Above my unbowed head ,</l>
     <l n="50">In equal poise</l>
     <l n="51">Death 's freedom</l>
     <l n="52">Or the servitude of life ,</l>
     <l n="53">I clutched at life :</l>
     <l n="54">And cared but little that his lips</l>
     <l n="55">Should curl , to see me , broken ,</l>
     <l n="56">A slave among his slaves .</l>
     <l n="57">Yet , never slave of his was I ;</l>
     <l n="58">Nor did I take my new life from his nod —</l>
     <l n="59">I ... I who could have torn</l>
     <l n="60">The proud life out of him ,</l>
     <l n="61">Before his guards could stay me ...</l>
     <l n="62">Had she not sat beside him , on her throne .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="63">And he , who knew not then ,</l>
     <l n="64">Nor ever , till to-day ,</l>
     <l n="65">Has known me aught but slave ,</l>
     <l n="66">Remembering that time ,</l>
     <l n="67">Spake doom of death to me ,</l>
     <l n="68">Idly , as to a slave :</l>
     <l n="69">And I await the end of night ,</l>
     <l n="70">And dawn of death ,</l>
     <l n="71">Even as a slave awaits ...</l>
     <l n="72">Nay ! as the unvanquished veteran</l>
     <l n="73">Awaits the hour of victory .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="74">In silence , wheels the night ,</l>
     <l n="75">Star-marshalled , over dreaming Babylon ;</l>
     <l n="76">And none in all the sleeping city stirs ,</l>
     <l n="77">Save the cloaked sentries on the outer walls</l>
     <l n="78">Who tread out patience ‘ twixt the gates of brass ,</l>
     <l n="79">Numb with scarce-baffled slumber ,</l>
     <l n="80">Or , maybe , some unsleeping priest of Bel ,</l>
     <l n="81">A lonely warder of eternity ,</l>
     <l n="82">Who watches on the temple 's seventh stage ,</l>
     <l n="83">With the unslumbering gods .</l>
     <l n="84">Yet , may not she , the Queen ,</l>
     <l n="85">Whose beauty , slaying my body ,</l>
     <l n="86">Brings my soul to immortal birth ,</l>
     <l n="87">Although she does not know</l>
     <l n="88">Of my last vigil on the peak of life —</l>
     <l n="89">Yet , may not she awaken , troubled</l>
     <l n="90">By strange , bewildering dreams ,</l>
     <l n="91">With heart a little fearful of the dawn</l>
     <l n="92">Of day , yet unrevealed ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="93">There is no sound at all ,</l>
     <l n="94">Save only the cool plashing</l>
     <l n="95">Of fountains in the courtyard</l>
     <l n="96">Without my lonely cell :</l>
     <l n="97">For fate has granted to me</l>
     <l n="98">This last , least consolation of sweet sound</l>
     <l n="99">Though in the plains I perish ,</l>
     <l n="100">I shall hear the noise of waters ,</l>
     <l n="101">The noise of running waters ,</l>
     <l n="102">As I die .</l>
     <l n="103">My earliest lullaby shall sing</l>
     <l n="104">My heart again to slumber .</l>
     <l n="105">And , even now , I hear</l>
     <l n="106">Stream-voices , long-forgotten , calling me</l>
     <l n="107">Back to the hills of home ;</l>
     <l n="108">And , dreaming , I remember</l>
     <l n="109">The little yellow brooks</l>
     <l n="110">That ever , day and night ,</l>
     <l n="111">Gush down the mountains singing ,</l>
     <l n="112">Singing by the caves :</l>
     <l n="113">And hearkening unto them ,</l>
     <l n="114">Once more a tiny baby ,</l>
     <l n="115">A wee brown fist I dabble</l>
     <l n="116">In the foaming cool ,</l>
     <l n="117">Frothing round my wrist ,</l>
     <l n="118">Spurting up my arm ,</l>
     <l n="119">Spraying my warm face ;</l>
     <l n="120">And then again I chuckle ,</l>
     <l n="121">As I see an empty gourd ,</l>
     <l n="122">Fallen in the swirling waters ,</l>
     <l n="123">Bobbing on the tawny eddies ,</l>
     <l n="124">Swiftly out of sight .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="125">And yet most clearly to remembrance comes</l>
     <l n="126">That far-off night , in early Spring ,</l>
     <l n="127">When , loud with melted snow from Northern peaks ,</l>
     <l n="128">The torrent roared and fretted ;</l>
     <l n="129">While , couched within the cavern ,</l>
     <l n="130">The clamour kept me wakeful ;</l>
     <l n="131">And , even when I slept ,</l>
     <l n="132">Tumbled , tumultuous , through my dreams ,</l>
     <l n="133">And seemed to surge about me ,</l>
     <l n="134">As the brawl of armed men .</l>
     <l n="135">And once I sprang from slumber ,</l>
     <l n="136">Hot and startled ,</l>
     <l n="137">Dreaming that I felt</l>
     <l n="138">A warm breath on my cheek ,</l>
     <l n="139">As if a jackal nuzzled me ;</l>
     <l n="140">Or some dread , slinking foe</l>
     <l n="141">Made certain of my sleeping</l>
     <l n="142">Before he plunged the steel .</l>
     <l n="143">But nothing stirred within the glimmering cavern ,</l>
     <l n="144">Where , all around me , lay my sleeping kindred ;</l>
     <l n="145">And , when I stole without , with noiseless footsteps ,</l>
     <l n="146">To rouse the smouldering watchfire into flame ,</l>
     <l n="147">And cast fresh , crackling brushwood on the blaze ,</l>
     <l n="148">I caught no glint of arms betwixt the branches ,</l>
     <l n="149">Nor any sound or rumour , save</l>
     <l n="150">The choral noise of cold hill-waters ,</l>
     <l n="151">Cold hill-waters singing ,</l>
     <l n="152">Singing to the stars .</l>
     <l n="153">And so I turned me from the brooding night ;</l>
     <l n="154">And , couched again upon the leopard-skins ,</l>
     <l n="155">I slept , till dawn , in dream-untroubled sleep .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="156">I woke to see the cold sky kindling red ,</l>
     <l n="157">Beyond the mounded ash of the spent fire ;</l>
     <l n="158">And lay , a moment , watching</l>
     <l n="159">The pearly light , caught , trembling ,</l>
     <l n="160">In dewy-beaded spiders ’ webs</l>
     <l n="161">About the cave-mouth woven .</l>
     <l n="162">Then I arose ;</l>
     <l n="163">And left my kindred , slumbering —</l>
     <l n="164">My mother , by my father ,</l>
     <l n="165">And , at her breast , her youngest babe ,</l>
     <l n="166">With dimpled fingers clutching at her bosom ;</l>
     <l n="167">And , all around them , lying</l>
     <l n="168">Their sons and daughters , beautiful in sleep ,</l>
     <l n="169">With parted lips ,</l>
     <l n="170">And easy limbs outstretched</l>
     <l n="171">Along the tumbled bedskins :</l>
     <l n="172">And while they slumbered yet in shades of night ,</l>
     <l n="173">I sprang out naked</l>
     <l n="174">Into eager dawn .</l>
     <l n="175">The sun had not yet scaled the eastern ridge :</l>
     <l n="176">And still the vales were hidden from my eyes</l>
     <l n="177">By snowy wreaths of swathing mist :</l>
     <l n="178">But , high upon a scar</l>
     <l n="179">That jutted sheer and stark ,</l>
     <l n="180">In cold grey light ,</l>
     <l n="181">There stood an antelope ,</l>
     <l n="182">With lifted muzzle snuffing the fresh day ;</l>
     <l n="183">When scenting me afar ,</l>
     <l n="184">He plunged into the mist</l>
     <l n="185">With one quick , startled bound :</l>
     <l n="186">And , from the smoking vapour ,</l>
     <l n="187">Arose a gentle pattering ,</l>
     <l n="188">As , down the rocky trail ,</l>
     <l n="189">The unseen herd went trotting</l>
     <l n="190">Upon their leader 's heels .</l>
     <l n="191">And from the clear horizon</l>
     <l n="192">The exultant sun sprang god-like :</l>
     <l n="193">And on a little mound I stood ,</l>
     <l n="194">With eager arms outstretched ,</l>
     <l n="195">That , over my cold body ,</l>
     <l n="196">The first warm golden beams</l>
     <l n="197">Of his life-giving light might fall .</l>
     <l n="198">And thus , awhile , I stood .</l>
     <l n="199">In radiant adoration tranced ,</l>
     <l n="200">Until I caught the call of waters ;</l>
     <l n="201">And , running downwards to the stream ,</l>
     <l n="202">That plunged into a darkling pool ,</l>
     <l n="203">Where , in the rock was scooped a wide , deep basin ;</l>
     <l n="204">Upon the glassy brink ,</l>
     <l n="205">A moment , I hung , shivering ,</l>
     <l n="206">And gazing down through deeps of lucent shadow ;</l>
     <l n="207">And then I leapt headlong ,</l>
     <l n="208">And felt the cloven waters</l>
     <l n="209">Closing , icy-cold , above me ,</l>
     <l n="210">And , again , with sobbing breath ,</l>
     <l n="211">Battled to the light and air :</l>
     <l n="212">And I ran into the sunshine ,</l>
     <l n="213">Shaking from my tingling limbs</l>
     <l n="214">Showers of scintillating drops</l>
     <l n="215">Over radiant , dewy beds</l>
     <l n="216">Of the snowy cyclamen ,</l>
     <l n="217">And dark-red anemone ,</l>
     <l n="218">Till my tawny body glowed</l>
     <l n="219">With warm , ruddy , pulsing life .</l>
     <l n="220">And then again I sought the stream ,</l>
     <l n="221">And plunged ; and now , more boldly ,</l>
     <l n="222">I crossed the pool , with easy stroke ;</l>
     <l n="223">And climbed the further crag ;</l>
     <l n="224">And , turning , plunged again .</l>
     <l n="225">And so , I dived and swam ,</l>
     <l n="226">Till pangs of hunger pricked</l>
     <l n="227">My idle fancy homeward :</l>
     <l n="228">And eagerly I climbed the hill ;</l>
     <l n="229">When , not a sling 's throw from the cavern ,</l>
     <l n="230">Stooping to pluck a red anemone ,</l>
     <l n="231">To prank the wet , black tangle of my hair ,</l>
     <l n="232">I heard a shout ;</l>
     <l n="233">And looking up ,</l>
     <l n="234">I saw strange men</l>
     <l n="235">With lifted spears</l>
     <l n="236">Bear down on me :</l>
     <l n="237">And as I turned ,</l>
     <l n="238">A javelin sang</l>
     <l n="239">Above my shrinking shoulder ,</l>
     <l n="240">And bit the ground before me .</l>
     <l n="241">But , swift as light I sped ,</l>
     <l n="242">Until I reached the pool ,</l>
     <l n="243">And leapt therein :</l>
     <l n="244">And he who pressed most hotly on my heels ,</l>
     <l n="245">Fell stumbling after .</l>
     <l n="246">Still I never slackened ,</l>
     <l n="247">Although I heard a floundering splash ,</l>
     <l n="248">And then the laughter of his comrades :</l>
     <l n="249">And , as I swam for life ,</l>
     <l n="250">Betwixt my thrusting heels ,</l>
     <l n="251">Another spear that clove the crystal waters</l>
     <l n="252">Glanced underneath my body ,</l>
     <l n="253">And in the stream-bed quivered bolt upright ,</l>
     <l n="254">Caught in a cleft of rock .</l>
     <l n="255">With frantic arm I struck</l>
     <l n="256">Straight as a snake across the pool ,</l>
     <l n="257">And climbed the further bank ;</l>
     <l n="258">And plunging through deep brake ,</l>
     <l n="259">Ran wildly onward ,</l>
     <l n="260">Startling as I went</l>
     <l n="261">A browsing herd of antelope ,</l>
     <l n="262">That , bounding , fled before me down the valley</l>
     <l n="263">And after them I raced ,</l>
     <l n="264">As though the hunter ,</l>
     <l n="265">Not the hunted ,</l>
     <l n="266">Until the chase sang in my blood ,</l>
     <l n="267">And braced my straining thews .</l>
     <l n="268">I knew not if men followed ,</l>
     <l n="269">Yet , on I sped , impetuously ,</l>
     <l n="270">As speeds the fleet-foot onaga ,</l>
     <l n="271">That breasts the windy morning ,</l>
     <l n="272">With lifted head , and nostrils wide ,</l>
     <l n="273">Exultant in his youth .</l>
     <l n="274">So , on and ever on ,</l>
     <l n="275">Scarce knowing why I ran —</l>
     <l n="276">Enough for me to feel</l>
     <l n="277">Earth beaten back behind my heels ,</l>
     <l n="278">And hear the loud air singing</l>
     <l n="279">The blood-song in my ears :</l>
     <l n="280">Till , stumbling headlong over</l>
     <l n="281">An unseen , fallen branch ,</l>
     <l n="282">I rolled in a deep bed of withered leaves ;</l>
     <l n="283">And lay , full-length in shuddering ecstasy</l>
     <l n="284">Of hot , tumultuous blood that rioted</l>
     <l n="285">Through every throbbing vein .</l>
     <l n="286">But when again , I breathed more easily ,</l>
     <l n="287">And my wild , fluttering heart kept slower beat ,</l>
     <l n="288">Hot-foot , my thoughts ran , wondering , backward :</l>
     <l n="289">And I arose and followed them</l>
     <l n="290">With swift and stealthy pace ,</l>
     <l n="291">Until I reached the stream .</l>
     <l n="292">Along the bank I stole with wary step ,</l>
     <l n="293">Until I came to where the waters</l>
     <l n="294">Narrowed , raging through a gorge ,</l>
     <l n="295">Nigh the threshold of my home :</l>
     <l n="296">And across the thunderous flood ,</l>
     <l n="297">From crag to crag I leapt :</l>
     <l n="298">And then I climbed a cedar ,</l>
     <l n="299">From whose close ambush I could watch</l>
     <l n="300">Who came or went about the cavern-mouth .</l>
     <l n="301">I lay along a level branch :</l>
     <l n="302">And , through the thick , dark screen ,</l>
     <l n="303">I peered with eager eyes :</l>
     <l n="304">But no one crossed my sight .</l>
     <l n="305">The whole land lay before me , drowsing</l>
     <l n="306">In deepest noonday slumber :</l>
     <l n="307">No twig stirred in the breathless blaze ;</l>
     <l n="308">And underneath the boughs no serpent rustled :</l>
     <l n="309">And , in the earth and air ,</l>
     <l n="310">Naught waked , save one lone eagle , nigh the sun ,</l>
     <l n="311">With wings , unbaffled , beating</l>
     <l n="312">Up the blue , unclouded heavens .</l>
     <l n="313">A dreamless , suave security</l>
     <l n="314">Seemed brooding o'er the valley 's golden slumber ,</l>
     <l n="315">Whence rang or flashed no hint of lurking peril .</l>
     <l n="316">I dropped to earth ,</l>
     <l n="317">And crouching low ,</l>
     <l n="318">I stole yet nearer</l>
     <l n="319">Through the brake :</l>
     <l n="320">Till , drawing nigh the cavern-mouth ,</l>
     <l n="321">I heard the sound of half-hushed sobbing :</l>
     <l n="322">And then I saw , within the gloom ,</l>
     <l n="323">My mother and my sisters clustering round</l>
     <l n="324">My father 's body , lying stark and dead ,</l>
     <l n="325">A spear-wound in his breast .</l>
     <l n="326">And as I crept to them , they did not hear me ,</l>
     <l n="327">Nor ever lift their heads ;</l>
     <l n="328">But , shuddering , crouched together ,</l>
     <l n="329">With drooping breasts half-hid in falling hair ,</l>
     <l n="330">By that familiar form</l>
     <l n="331">In such strange slumber bound .</l>
     <l n="332">Only the baby , on her shoulder slung ,</l>
     <l n="333">Saw me , and crowed me greeting ,</l>
     <l n="334">As I stooped down to touch my weeping mother ,</l>
     <l n="335">Who , turning suddenly ,</l>
     <l n="336">With wild tear-fevered eyes ;</l>
     <l n="337">Arose with whispered warning ;</l>
     <l n="338">But , even then , too late .</l>
     <l n="339">Already , from behind ,</l>
     <l n="340">Around my throat</l>
     <l n="341">An arm was flung ;</l>
     <l n="342">And heavily I fell :</l>
     <l n="343">Yet , with a desperate wrench ,</l>
     <l n="344">I slipped the clutch of my assailant :</l>
     <l n="345">And picking up a slingstone that lay handy ,</l>
     <l n="346">I crashed it through his helm ;</l>
     <l n="347">And dead he dropped .</l>
     <l n="348">And now upon me all his fellows thronged ,</l>
     <l n="349">Like hounds about an antelope ;</l>
     <l n="350">And gripped my naked limbs ,</l>
     <l n="351">And dragged me down ,</l>
     <l n="352">A struggling beast , among them :</l>
     <l n="353">And desperately I fought ,</l>
     <l n="354">As fights the boar at bay ,</l>
     <l n="355">When all the yelling pack ,</l>
     <l n="356">With lathered lips , and white teeth gnashing ,</l>
     <l n="357">Is closing in upon him ;</l>
     <l n="358">And in his quivering flank , and gasping throat ,</l>
     <l n="359">He feels the fangs of death :</l>
     <l n="360">Till , overcome at last ,</l>
     <l n="361">They bound me hand and foot ,</l>
     <l n="362">With knotted , leathern thongs ;</l>
     <l n="363">And dragged me out to where , beneath the trees ,</l>
     <l n="364">Trussed in like manner , with defiant eyes ,</l>
     <l n="365">My brothers lay , already , side by side .</l>
     <l n="366">They laid me in the shade ;</l>
     <l n="367">And flicked my wincing spirit</l>
     <l n="368">With laughter and light words :</l>
     <l n="369">“ Now is the roe-buck taken ! ”</l>
     <l n="370">Then another ,</l>
     <l n="371">On whose dark , sullen face there burned a livid weal</l>
     <l n="372">“ A buck in flight 's a panther brought to bay ! ”</l>
     <l n="373">And then his fellow :</l>
     <l n="374">“ True enough ! and yet ,</l>
     <l n="375">For such young thews they give good gold —</l>
     <l n="376">They give good gold in Babylon ! ”</l>
     <l n="377">And , laughing thus , they left us ,</l>
     <l n="378">To lie through hours of aching silence ,</l>
     <l n="379">Until , at length , the cool of evening fell ;</l>
     <l n="380">When they returned from slumber ;</l>
     <l n="381">And loosed the ankle-cords that we might stand ;</l>
     <l n="382">And bade our mother feed us ;</l>
     <l n="383">And she , with tender fingers , held</l>
     <l n="384">The milk-bowl to our parching lips ;</l>
     <l n="385">And thrust dried dates betwixt our teeth ;</l>
     <l n="386">And wept , to see us standing there ,</l>
     <l n="387">With helpless hands , before her .</l>
     <l n="388">Then , bringing out their mules , they saddled them ;</l>
     <l n="389">And tied us to the girths on either hand .</l>
     <l n="390">They drove my weeping sisters from the cavern ;</l>
     <l n="391">And sought to tear my mother from her home ;</l>
     <l n="392">But she escaped them ;</l>
     <l n="393">And they let her bide</l>
     <l n="394">Amid the ruins of her life ,</l>
     <l n="395">Whose light had dropped , so suddenly ,</l>
     <l n="396">From out the highest heavens :</l>
     <l n="397">And , when I turned to look on her ,</l>
     <l n="398">And win from her a last farewell ,</l>
     <l n="399">I saw her , sitting desolate betwixt</l>
     <l n="400">Her silent husband and her wailing babe ,</l>
     <l n="401">With still , strange eyes ,</l>
     <l n="402">That stared upon the dead , unseeing ,</l>
     <l n="403">While her own children went from her ,</l>
     <l n="404">Scarce knowing that they left her , nevermore</l>
     <l n="405">To look upon her face .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="406">Thus , we set out , as over</l>
     <l n="407">The darkening , Southern crags</l>
     <l n="408">The new moon 's keen , curved blade was thrust :</l>
     <l n="409">My sisters trooping on before us ,</l>
     <l n="410">Like a drove of young gazelles ,</l>
     <l n="411">Which , in the dead of night ,</l>
     <l n="412">With pards in leash , and torches flaring ,</l>
     <l n="413">The hunters have encompassed .</l>
     <l n="414">They moved with timid steps ,</l>
     <l n="415">And little runs ;</l>
     <l n="416">Stumbling , with stifled cries ;</l>
     <l n="417">And starting , panic-shot ,</l>
     <l n="418">From every lurking shadow —</l>
     <l n="419">Behind them , terror 's lifted lash :</l>
     <l n="420">Before them , ever crouching ,</l>
     <l n="421">The horror of the unknown night —</l>
     <l n="422">While , as they moved before us ,</l>
     <l n="423">The moonlight shivered off their shrinking shoulders</l>
     <l n="424">And naked , glancing limbs ,</l>
     <l n="425">In shimmering , strange beauty .</l>
     <l n="426">And closely on their heels ,</l>
     <l n="427">I , with my brothers , foremost in the file ,</l>
     <l n="428">Marched , tethered ‘ twixt the plodding beasts ,</l>
     <l n="429">Whose stolid riders sat ,</l>
     <l n="430">Each with his javelin on the pummel couched ,</l>
     <l n="431">In watchful silence , with dark eyes alert .</l>
     <l n="432">And once , nigh driven crazy</l>
     <l n="433">By the tugging of the thongs ,</l>
     <l n="434">I sprang into the air ,</l>
     <l n="435">As down a rocky steep we scrambled ;</l>
     <l n="436">And strove to burst the galling bonds ,</l>
     <l n="437">Or hurl my guards on one another ;</l>
     <l n="438">But , all too sure of foot , the beasts ,</l>
     <l n="439">And too securely girths and cords</l>
     <l n="440">Held me , and I stumbled .</l>
     <l n="441">Instantly a thong</l>
     <l n="442">Struck my wincing shoulders ,</l>
     <l n="443">Blow on thudding blow .</l>
     <l n="444">I bit my lips ; and strode on silently ;</l>
     <l n="445">Nor fought again for freedom .</l>
     <l n="446">So on we journeyed through the night ,</l>
     <l n="447">And down familiar mountain-tracks ,</l>
     <l n="448">Through deep , dark forest ,</l>
     <l n="449">Ever down and down ;</l>
     <l n="450">Fording the streams , whose moon-bright waters flowed ,</l>
     <l n="451">In eddies of delicious , aching cool ,</l>
     <l n="452">About our weary thighs .</l>
     <l n="453">And , once , when in mid-torrent ,</l>
     <l n="454">That swirled , girth-high about the plunging beasts ,</l>
     <l n="455">A startled otter , glancing</l>
     <l n="456">Before their very hoofs ,</l>
     <l n="457">Affrighted them ; and , rearing ,</l>
     <l n="458">With blind and desperate floundering ,</l>
     <l n="459">They nearly dragged us down to death :</l>
     <l n="460">And , ere we righted ,</l>
     <l n="461">With a fearful cry ,</l>
     <l n="462">My eldest sister from the bevy broke ;</l>
     <l n="463">And struck down-stream</l>
     <l n="464">With wild arm lashing desperately ,</l>
     <l n="465">Until the current caught her ;</l>
     <l n="466">And she sank , to rise no more .</l>
     <l n="467">And on again we travelled ,</l>
     <l n="468">Down through the darkling woodlands :</l>
     <l n="469">And once I saw green , burning eyes ,</l>
     <l n="470">Where , on a low-hung bough ,</l>
     <l n="471">A night-black panther crouched ,</l>
     <l n="472">As though to pounce upon my sisters ;</l>
     <l n="473">But , the sudden crack of whips ,</l>
     <l n="474">Startling him , he snarled ;</l>
     <l n="475">And turned with lashing tail ,</l>
     <l n="476">Crashing through dense brushwood .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="477">When , once , again we came unto a clearing ,</l>
     <l n="478">The night was near its noon :</l>
     <l n="479">And all the vales that lay before us</l>
     <l n="480">Were filled with moving , moonlit mists ,</l>
     <l n="481">That seemed phantasmal waters</l>
     <l n="482">Of that enchanted world ,</l>
     <l n="483">Where we , in dreams , sail over still lagoons ,</l>
     <l n="484">Throughout eternal night ,</l>
     <l n="485">And under unknown stars .</l>
     <l n="486">Still , on we fared , unresting ,</l>
     <l n="487">Until the low moon paled ;</l>
     <l n="488">When , halting on a mountain-spur ,</l>
     <l n="489">We first looked down on Babylon ,</l>
     <l n="490">Far in the dreaming West ,</l>
     <l n="491">A cluster of dim towers ,</l>
     <l n="492">Scarce visible to wearied eyes .</l>
     <l n="493">We camped within a sheltering cedar-grove ;</l>
     <l n="494">And all the day , beneath the level boughs ,</l>
     <l n="495">Upon the agelong-bedded needles lay ,</l>
     <l n="496">Half-slumbering , with fleeting , fretful dreams</l>
     <l n="497">That could not quite forget the chafing cords ,</l>
     <l n="498">That held our arms in aching numbness :</l>
     <l n="499">But , ere the noon , in sounder sleep I sank ,</l>
     <l n="500">Dreaming I floated on a still , deep pool ,</l>
     <l n="501">Beneath dark , overhanging branches ;</l>
     <l n="502">And seemed to feel upon my cheek</l>
     <l n="503">The cool caress of waters ;</l>
     <l n="504">While , far above me , through the night of trees ,</l>
     <l n="505">Noon glimmered faintly as the glint of stars .</l>
     <l n="506">As thus I lay , in indolent ecstasy ,</l>
     <l n="507">O'er me , suddenly , the waters</l>
     <l n="508">Curved , and I was dragged ,</l>
     <l n="509">Down and down ,</l>
     <l n="510">Through gurgling deeps</l>
     <l n="511">Of swirling , drowning darkness ...</l>
     <l n="512">When I awoke in terror ;</l>
     <l n="513">And strove to sit upright ;</l>
     <l n="514">But , tautly , with a jerk ,</l>
     <l n="515">The thongs that held me to my brothers ,</l>
     <l n="516">Dragged me back to earth .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="517">Awhile I lay , with staring eyes , awake ,</l>
     <l n="518">Watching a big , grey spider , crouched overhead ,</l>
     <l n="519">In ambush ‘ neath a twig , beside her web ,</l>
     <l n="520">Oft sallying out , to bind yet more securely ,</l>
     <l n="521">The half-entangled flies .</l>
     <l n="522">And then , once more , I slumbered ;</l>
     <l n="523">And dreamed a face leant over me ,</l>
     <l n="524">More fair than any face</l>
     <l n="525">My waking eyes had ever looked upon .</l>
     <l n="526">Its beauty burned above me ,</l>
     <l n="527">Not dusky like my sisters ’ faces ,</l>
     <l n="528">But pale as the wan moon ,</l>
     <l n="529">Reflected in a flood</l>
     <l n="530">Of darkly flowing waters ,</l>
     <l n="531">Or as the creaming froth ,</l>
     <l n="532">That , born amid the thunder of the fall ,</l>
     <l n="533">Floats on the river 's bosom in the sunshine ,</l>
     <l n="534">Bubble after bubble ,</l>
     <l n="535">Perishing in air .</l>
     <l n="536">So , a moment , over me ,</l>
     <l n="537">With frail and fleeting glimmer</l>
     <l n="538">Of strange elusive , evanescent light ,</l>
     <l n="539">The holy vision hovered .</l>
     <l n="540">And yet , whenever , with a fervent longing ,</l>
     <l n="541">I sought to look into the darkling eyes ,</l>
     <l n="542">The face would fade from me ,</l>
     <l n="543">As foam caught in an eddy :</l>
     <l n="544">Until , at last , I wakened ,</l>
     <l n="545">And , wondering , saw a pale star gleaming</l>
     <l n="546">Betwixt the cedar-branches .</l>
     <l n="547">And soon our captors stirred :</l>
     <l n="548">And we arose , to see</l>
     <l n="549">The walls and towers of Babylon , dark</l>
     <l n="550">Against the clear rose of the afterglow ,</l>
     <l n="551">Already in the surge of shadows caught ,</l>
     <l n="552">As night , beneath us , slowly Westward swept ,</l>
     <l n="553">Flooding the dreaming plain that lay before us ,</l>
     <l n="554">Vast , limitless , bewildering ,</l>
     <l n="555">And strange to mountain-eyes .</l>
     <l n="556">As down the slope we went ,</l>
     <l n="557">And when , at last , we left behind</l>
     <l n="558">The hills and singing waters ,</l>
     <l n="559">A vague , oppressive fear</l>
     <l n="560">Of those dim , silent leagues of level land ,</l>
     <l n="561">Fell on me ; and I almost seemed</l>
     <l n="562">To bear upon my shoulders</l>
     <l n="563">The vaster dome of overwhelming night ;</l>
     <l n="564">And , trembling like a child ,</l>
     <l n="565">I looked askance at my two captors ,</l>
     <l n="566">As they rode on in heedless silence ,</l>
     <l n="567">Their swarthy faces sharp</l>
     <l n="568">Against the lucent sky .</l>
     <l n="569">And then , once more ,</l>
     <l n="570">The old , familiar watchfires of the stars</l>
     <l n="571">Brought courage to my bosom ;</l>
     <l n="572">And the young moon 's brilliant horn</l>
     <l n="573">Was exalted in the sky :</l>
     <l n="574">And soon , the glooming wilderness</l>
     <l n="575">Awoke with glittering waters ,</l>
     <l n="576">As a friendly wind sang unto me</l>
     <l n="577">Among the swaying reeds :</l>
     <l n="578">While , cloud on cloud ,</l>
     <l n="579">The snowy flocks of pelican</l>
     <l n="580">Before our coming rose ;</l>
     <l n="581">And , as they swerved to Southward ,</l>
     <l n="582">The moonlight shivered off their flashing pinions .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="583">So , on we marched , till dawn , across the plain ;</l>
     <l n="584">And , on and on ,</l>
     <l n="585">Beneath the waxing moon ,</l>
     <l n="586">Each night we travelled Westward ;</l>
     <l n="587">Until , at last , we halted</l>
     <l n="588">By the broad dull-gleaming flood</l>
     <l n="589">Of mighty , roaring Tigris ;</l>
     <l n="590">And aroused from midnight slumber</l>
     <l n="591">The surly , grumbling ferrymen ,</l>
     <l n="592">And crossed the swollen waters</l>
     <l n="593">Upon the great , skin rafts :</l>
     <l n="594">Then on again we fared ,</l>
     <l n="595">Until the far , dim towers soared in the dawnlight</l>
     <l n="596">And we encamped beside a stream ,</l>
     <l n="597">Beneath dry , rustling palms .</l>
     <l n="598">And heavily I slumbered :</l>
     <l n="599">And only wakened once , at noon ,</l>
     <l n="600">When , lifting up my head ,</l>
     <l n="601">I saw the towers of Babylon , burning blue ,</l>
     <l n="602">Far off , in the blind heat :</l>
     <l n="603">And slept again , till sunset ,</l>
     <l n="604">When we took our Westward course</l>
     <l n="605">Along the low bank of a broad canal ,</l>
     <l n="606">That glimmered wanly ‘ neath a moonless sky .</l>
     <l n="607">Higher , and higher still ,</l>
     <l n="608">As we drew slowly nearer ,</l>
     <l n="609">Arose the vasty walls and serried towers ,</l>
     <l n="610">That seemed to thrust among the stars ,</l>
     <l n="611">And on embattled summits bear the night ,</l>
     <l n="612">Unbowed beneath their burden ,</l>
     <l n="613">As easily as , with unruffled brows ,</l>
     <l n="614">And limber , upright bodies ,</l>
     <l n="615">The village-daughters carry</l>
     <l n="616">At eve the brimming pitchers ,</l>
     <l n="617">Poised upon their heads .</l>
     <l n="618">And when , above us , the wide-looming walls</l>
     <l n="619">Shut out the Western stars ;</l>
     <l n="620">Beneath their shade , at midnight , we encamped ,</l>
     <l n="621">To await till dawn should open</l>
     <l n="622">The city gates for us .</l>
     <l n="623">That night we did not sleep ,</l>
     <l n="624">But , crouched upon the ground ,</l>
     <l n="625">We watched the moon rise over Babylon ,</l>
     <l n="626">Till , far behind us , o'er the glittering waste ,</l>
     <l n="627">Was flung the wall 's huge shadow ,</l>
     <l n="628">And the moving shades of sentries ,</l>
     <l n="629">Who , unseen above our heads ,</l>
     <l n="630">Paced through the night incessantly .</l>
     <l n="631">Thus long we sat , hushed with awed expectation ,</l>
     <l n="632">And gazing o'er the plain that we had travelled ,</l>
     <l n="633">As , gradually , the climbing moon ,</l>
     <l n="634">Escaping from the clustering towers ,</l>
     <l n="635">Revealed far-gleaming waters ,</l>
     <l n="636">And the sharp , shrill cry of owls ,</l>
     <l n="637">Sweeping by on noiseless plumes ,</l>
     <l n="638">Assailed the vasty silence ,</l>
     <l n="639">Shivering off like darts</l>
     <l n="640">From some impenetrable shield .</l>
     <l n="641">And , as we waited ,</l>
     <l n="642">Sometimes , fearfully ,</l>
     <l n="643">I gazed up those stupendous , soaring walls</l>
     <l n="644">Of that great , slumbering city , wondering</l>
     <l n="645">What doom behind the bastioned ramparts slept ,</l>
     <l n="646">What destiny , beneath the brooding night ,</l>
     <l n="647">Awaited me beyond the brazen gates .</l>
     <l n="648">But , naught the blind , indifferent stars revealed ,</l>
     <l n="649">Though towards the long night 's ending ,</l>
     <l n="650">Half-dazed with gazing up that aching height ,</l>
     <l n="651">A drowsiness fell over me ,</l>
     <l n="652">And in a restless waking-trance I lay ,</l>
     <l n="653">Dreaming that Life and Death before me stood .</l>
     <l n="654">And , as each thrust towards me a shrouded cup ,</l>
     <l n="655">Implacable silence bade me choose and drink .</l>
     <l n="656">But , as I stretched a blind , uncertain hand</l>
     <l n="657">To take the cup of death ,</l>
     <l n="658">I wakened , and dawn trembled ,</l>
     <l n="659">At last , beyond the Eastern hills ,</l>
     <l n="660">And , star by star , night failed ;</l>
     <l n="661">And eagerly the sun leapt up the sky ,</l>
     <l n="662">And , as his flashing rays</l>
     <l n="663">Smote kindling towers and flaming gates of brass ,</l>
     <l n="664">Across the reedy moat</l>
     <l n="665">A clattering drawbridge fell ,</l>
     <l n="666">And wide the glittering portals slowly swung :</l>
     <l n="667">And there came streaming out in slow procession</l>
     <l n="668">A sleepy caravan of slouching camels ,</l>
     <l n="669">Groaning and grumbling as they strode along</l>
     <l n="670">Beneath their mountainous burdens ,</l>
     <l n="671">Upon whose swaying summits ,</l>
     <l n="672">Impassively , the blue-robed merchants sat .</l>
     <l n="673">They passed us slowly by ,</l>
     <l n="674">And then we took the bridge ,</l>
     <l n="675">And , while our captors parleyed with the guards ,</l>
     <l n="676">Who stood , on either hand ,</l>
     <l n="677">With naked swords ,</l>
     <l n="678">I turned my head ,</l>
     <l n="679">And saw for the last time , far Eastward ,</l>
     <l n="680">The cold , snow-brilliant peaks ,</l>
     <l n="681">Beyond my dim , blue , native hills .</l>
     <l n="682">And , as I looked , my thoughts flew homeward ,</l>
     <l n="683">And I , one dreaming moment ,</l>
     <l n="684">Stood by my mourning mother in the cavern</l>
     <l n="685">Of desolation , looking on the dead .</l>
     <l n="686">And then , between the brazen gate-posts ,</l>
     <l n="687">And underneath the brazen lintel ,</l>
     <l n="688">At last we entered Babylon .</l>
     <l n="689">Before us , yet another wall arose ,</l>
     <l n="690">And , turning sharply</l>
     <l n="691">Down a narrow way ,</l>
     <l n="692">The living breath of heaven seemed shut from us</l>
     <l n="693">As though beneath the beetling crags</l>
     <l n="694">Of some deep mountain-gorge —</l>
     <l n="695">By cliffs of wall , on either hand ,</l>
     <l n="696">That soared up to the narrow sky ,</l>
     <l n="697">Which with dim lustre lit</l>
     <l n="698">The shimmering surface of enamelled brick ,</l>
     <l n="699">Whereon , through giant groves ,</l>
     <l n="700">Blue-coated hunters chased the boar ,</l>
     <l n="701">Or ‘ loosed red-tasselled falcon</l>
     <l n="702">After flying crane .</l>
     <l n="703">But soon we reached another gate ,</l>
     <l n="704">Sword-guarded , and we entered ,</l>
     <l n="705">And plunged into the traffic</l>
     <l n="706">Of clamorous merchantmen ,</l>
     <l n="707">Speeding their business ere the heat of day .</l>
     <l n="708">And as we jostled , slowly ,</l>
     <l n="709">Through bewildering bazaars ,</l>
     <l n="710">The porters and the idler wayfarers</l>
     <l n="711">All turned to look upon our shame ,</l>
     <l n="712">With cold , unpitying eyes ,</l>
     <l n="713">And indolent , gaping mouths ,</l>
     <l n="714">Or jested with our captors ,</l>
     <l n="715">Until we left the busier thoroughfares ,</l>
     <l n="716">And walked through groves of cypress and of ilex ,</l>
     <l n="717">Where not a sound or rumour troubled</l>
     <l n="718">The silence of the dark-plumed boughs</l>
     <l n="719">And glimmering deeps of peace ,</l>
     <l n="720">Save only the cool spurt of waters</l>
     <l n="721">That , from a myriad unseen jets ,</l>
     <l n="722">Fretted the crystal airs of morning ,</l>
     <l n="723">And fell in frolic showers</l>
     <l n="724">Of twinkling , rainbow drops ,</l>
     <l n="725">That plashed in unseen basins ;</l>
     <l n="726">And through the blaze of almond-orchards ,</l>
     <l n="727">Tremulous with blossom</l>
     <l n="728">That flickered in a rosy , silken snow</l>
     <l n="729">Of falling petals over us ,</l>
     <l n="730">And wreathed about our feet</l>
     <l n="731">In soft and scented drifts ;</l>
     <l n="732">Beneath pomegranate trees in young , green leaf ,</l>
     <l n="733">And through vast gardens , glowing with strange flowers ,</l>
     <l n="734">Such as no April kindled into bloom</l>
     <l n="735">Among the valleys of my native hills .</l>
     <l n="736">We came unto a court of many fountains ,</l>
     <l n="737">Where , leaping off their jaded mules ,</l>
     <l n="738">Our captors loosed the thongs that held us ,</l>
     <l n="739">But left our wrists still bound .</l>
     <l n="740">And one with great clay pitchers came ,</l>
     <l n="741">And over our hot bodies , travel-stained ,</l>
     <l n="742">Poured out cool , cleansing waters</l>
     <l n="743">In a gurgling , crystal stream ,</l>
     <l n="744">And flung coarse robes of indigo</l>
     <l n="745">About our naked shoulders .</l>
     <l n="746">And here we left behind us</l>
     <l n="747">The maidens and the younger boys ,</l>
     <l n="748">And passing through a gateway ,</l>
     <l n="749">Came out upon a busy wharf ,</l>
     <l n="750">Where , southward , midway through the city ,</l>
     <l n="751">The broad Euphrates flows ,</l>
     <l n="752">His dark flood thronged with merchant-dhows ,</l>
     <l n="753">And fishing-boats of reed and bitumen ,</l>
     <l n="754">Piled high with glistering barbel , freshly-caught ;</l>
     <l n="755">And foreign craft , with many-coloured sails ,</l>
     <l n="756">And laden deep with precious merchandise ,</l>
     <l n="757">That , over wide , bewildering waters ,</l>
     <l n="758">Across the perilous world ,</l>
     <l n="759">The adventurous , dark-bearded mariners ,</l>
     <l n="760">Who swear by unknown gods in alien tongues ,</l>
     <l n="761">Bring ever to the gates of Babylon .</l>
     <l n="762">We crossed the drawbridge , round whose granite piers</l>
     <l n="763">Swirled strong , Spring-swollen waters ,</l>
     <l n="764">Loud and tawny ,</l>
     <l n="765">And , through great brazen portals ,</l>
     <l n="766">Passed within the palace gates ,</l>
     <l n="767">When first I saw afar the hanging-gardens ,</l>
     <l n="768">Arch on arch ,</l>
     <l n="769">And tier on tier ,</l>
     <l n="770">Against a glowing sky .</l>
     <l n="771">Two strapping Nubians , like young giants</l>
     <l n="772">Hewn from blue-black marble</l>
     <l n="773">By some immortal hand in immemorial ages ,</l>
     <l n="774">Led us slowly onward .</l>
     <l n="775">The dappled pard-skins , slung across their shoulders ,</l>
     <l n="776">Scarcely hid the ox-like thews ,</l>
     <l n="777">Beneath the dark skin rippling ,</l>
     <l n="778">As they strode along before us .</l>
     <l n="779">Through courts of alabaster ,</l>
     <l n="780">And painted corridors ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="781">And chambers fair with flowery tapestries</l>
     <l n="782">They led us , wondering , till at last we came</l>
     <l n="783">Into a vast , dim hall of glimmering gold ,</l>
     <l n="784">The end of all our journeying .</l>
     <l n="785">And , as we halted on the threshold ,</l>
     <l n="786">My eyes could see but little for a moment ,</l>
     <l n="787">In the dusky , heavy air ,</l>
     <l n="788">Through the ceaseless cloud of incense ,</l>
     <l n="789">Rising from the smouldering braziers</l>
     <l n="790">To the gold , grey-clouded dome ,</l>
     <l n="791">Tingling strangely in my nostrils ,</l>
     <l n="792">As I came from morning airs ;</l>
     <l n="793">Then slowly filling them with drowsy fume ,</l>
     <l n="794">When , looking up with half-dazed eyes ,</l>
     <l n="795">I saw the King upon his golden throne :</l>
     <l n="796">And through my body</l>
     <l n="797">Raged rebellious blood ,</l>
     <l n="798">In baffled riot beating</l>
     <l n="799">At my corded wrists ,</l>
     <l n="800">As if to burst the galling bonds ,</l>
     <l n="801">That I might hurl that lean , swart face ,</l>
     <l n="802">So idly turning towards us ,</l>
     <l n="803">With thin curled lips ,</l>
     <l n="804">And cold , incurious eyes ,</l>
     <l n="805">To headlong death —</l>
     <l n="806">Yea ! even though I tumbled</l>
     <l n="807">The towers of Babylon round about my head .</l>
     <l n="808">And , when our captors bowed their foreheads low ,</l>
     <l n="809">Obsequious to the throne ,</l>
     <l n="810">I stood upright ,</l>
     <l n="811">And gazed my loathing on that listless form —</l>
     <l n="812">The gay , embroidered robe ,</l>
     <l n="813">The golden cap , that prankt the crisped locks ,</l>
     <l n="814">The short , square beard , new-oiled and barbered —</l>
     <l n="815">But , in a flash ,</l>
     <l n="816">A heavy blow</l>
     <l n="817">Fell on my head ,</l>
     <l n="818">And struck me to my knees</l>
     <l n="819">Before the sleek , indifferent king .</l>
     <l n="820">And then , on either hand ,</l>
     <l n="821">With gripping palms upon my shoulders set ,</l>
     <l n="822">The Nubians towered above me</l>
     <l n="823">Like mighty men of stone .</l>
     <l n="824">And savagely I struggled ,</l>
     <l n="825">Half-stunned , to rise again ;</l>
     <l n="826">When , as I vainly battled</l>
     <l n="827">In their unrelenting clutch ,</l>
     <l n="828">My eyes lit for the first time on the Queen ,</l>
     <l n="829">Who sat upon the dais , by her lord</l>
     <l n="830">Half-shadowed , on a throne of ivory ,</l>
     <l n="831">And all the hate died in me , as I saw</l>
     <l n="832">The face that hovered over me in dream ,</l>
     <l n="833">When I had slept beneath the low-boughed cedar :</l>
     <l n="834">The moon-pale brows , o'er which the clustered hair</l>
     <l n="835">Hung like the smoke of torches , ruddy-gold ,</l>
     <l n="836">Against a canopy of peacock plumes :</l>
     <l n="837">The deep brown , burning eyes ,</l>
     <l n="838">From which the soul looked on me in fierce pity .</l>
     <l n="839">And , as I gazed on that exultant beauty ,</l>
     <l n="840">The hunter and the slayer of men</l>
     <l n="841">Was slain within me instantly ,</l>
     <l n="842">And I forgot the mountains and my home ;</l>
     <l n="843">My desolate mother , and my father 's death ;</l>
     <l n="844">My captive sisters ... and the throned King !</l>
     <l n="845">I was as one , that moment ,</l>
     <l n="846">New-born into the world</l>
     <l n="847">Full-limbed and thewed ,</l>
     <l n="848">Yet , with the wondering heart</l>
     <l n="849">Of earth-bewildered childhood .</l>
     <l n="850">And , unto me , it seemed</l>
     <l n="851">That , as the Queen looked down on me ,</l>
     <l n="852">There stole into her eyes</l>
     <l n="853">Some dim remembrance of old dreams ,</l>
     <l n="854">That in their brown depths flickered</l>
     <l n="855">With strange , elusive light ,</l>
     <l n="856">Like stars that tremble in still forest-pools .</l>
     <l n="857">One spake —</l>
     <l n="858">I scarce knew whom , nor cared —</l>
     <l n="859">And bade me choose ,</l>
     <l n="860">Before the throne ,</l>
     <l n="861">Between a life of slavery ,</l>
     <l n="862">Or merciful , swift death —</l>
     <l n="863">Death , that but a moment since ,</l>
     <l n="864">I would have dragged , exulting , on me —</l>
     <l n="865">And with my eyes still set on the Queen 's face ,</l>
     <l n="866">I answered :</l>
     <l n="867">“ I will serve ":</l>
     <l n="868">And scarcely heeded that my wrists were loosed .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="869">And , huddled in a stifling hut ,</l>
     <l n="870">That night , among my fellows ,</l>
     <l n="871">I could not sleep at all :</l>
     <l n="872">But gazed , wild-eyed , till dawn upon that face ,</l>
     <l n="873">Which hovered o'er me , like the moon of dreams ;</l>
     <l n="874">And seemed to draw the wandering tides of life</l>
     <l n="875">In one vast wave , which ever strove</l>
     <l n="876">To climb the heavens wherein she moved ,</l>
     <l n="877">That it might break in triumphing foam about her .</l>
     <l n="878">Not then , nor ever afterwards ,</l>
     <l n="879">Was I a slave , among my fellow-slaves ,</l>
     <l n="880">But one , who , with mean drudgery ,</l>
     <l n="881">And daily penance serves</l>
     <l n="882">Before a holy altar ,</l>
     <l n="883">That , sometimes , as he labours , his glad eyes</l>
     <l n="884">May catch a gleam of the immortal light</l>
     <l n="885">Within the secret shrine ;</l>
     <l n="886">Yea ! and , maybe , shall look , one day , with trembling ,</l>
     <l n="887">On the bright-haired , imperishable god .</l>
     <l n="888">And , even when , day after day ,</l>
     <l n="889">I bore the big reed-baskets , laden</l>
     <l n="890">With wet clay , digged beyond the Western moat ,</l>
     <l n="891">Although I seemed to tread ,</l>
     <l n="892">As treads the ox that turns the water-wheel ,</l>
     <l n="893">A blindfold round of servitude ,</l>
     <l n="894">My quenchless vision ever burned before me :</l>
     <l n="895">And when , in after days , I fed</l>
     <l n="896">The roaring oven-furnaces ;</l>
     <l n="897">And toiled by them through sweltering days ,</l>
     <l n="898">Though over me , at times , would come</l>
     <l n="899">Great longing for the hill-tops ,</l>
     <l n="900">And the noise of torrent-waters :</l>
     <l n="901">Or when , more skilled , I moulded</l>
     <l n="902">The damp clay into bricks ;</l>
     <l n="903">And spread the colour and the glaze ;</l>
     <l n="904">And in strength-giving heat of glowing kilns ,</l>
     <l n="905">I baked them durable ,</l>
     <l n="906">Clean-shaped , and meet for service :</l>
     <l n="907">My vision flamed yet brighter ;</l>
     <l n="908">And unto me it seemed</l>
     <l n="909">As if my gross and useless clay were burned</l>
     <l n="910">In a white ecstasy of lustral fire ,</l>
     <l n="911">That , in the fashioning of the house of love ,</l>
     <l n="912">I might serve perfectly the builder 's need .</l>
     <l n="913">Thus , many months , I laboured ;</l>
     <l n="914">Till , one day , at the noontide hour of rest ,</l>
     <l n="915">I lay ; and with a sharpened reed —</l>
     <l n="916">As temple-scribes write down the holy lore</l>
     <l n="917">On tablets of wet clay —</l>
     <l n="918">On the moist earth beside me ,</l>
     <l n="919">I limned a young fawn , cropping</l>
     <l n="920">A bunch of tender , overhanging leaves .</l>
     <l n="921">And , as I slowly drew ,</l>
     <l n="922">I dreamt a little sadly of the days ,</l>
     <l n="923">When I , too , roamed , untethered ,</l>
     <l n="924">And drinking in , unquestioning ,</l>
     <l n="925">The sunshine and the air ,</l>
     <l n="926">And all the rapture of the earth that turns ,</l>
     <l n="927">New every morning to the wondering sun ,</l>
     <l n="928">Refashioned in still nights of starry dews :</l>
     <l n="929">But one , the while , unseen of me ,</l>
     <l n="930">Watched my unconscious hand , approving :</l>
     <l n="931">And I was set , next morning ,</l>
     <l n="932">Among the craftsmen , who so deftly limned</l>
     <l n="933">The hunts and battles for the palace walls .</l>
     <l n="934">And , happily , with them I lived</l>
     <l n="935">A life of loving labour , for each line</l>
     <l n="936">Flowed from the knowledge of my heart :</l>
     <l n="937">I drew the startled ostrich</l>
     <l n="938">Fleeing from the far-flung noose :</l>
     <l n="939">The brindled lynx ; the onaga</l>
     <l n="940">In dewy-plashing flight ;</l>
     <l n="941">The bristling boar , at bay ,</l>
     <l n="942">Crouched in a deadly ring of threatening spears ,</l>
     <l n="943">With streaming nostrils , and red eyes ablaze ;</l>
     <l n="944">The striped hyaena ; the gaunt , green-eyed wolf ;</l>
     <l n="945">The skulking jackal ; the grey , brush-tailed fox ;</l>
     <l n="946">The hunting leopard and the antelope ,</l>
     <l n="947">In mid-chase tense ,</l>
     <l n="948">With every thew astrain ;</l>
     <l n="949">The dappled panther ; the brown-eyed gazelle ,</l>
     <l n="950">Butting with black horns through the tangled brake</l>
     <l n="951">The nimble hare , alert , with pricked-up ears ;</l>
     <l n="952">The tiger , crouched , with yellow eyes afire ;</l>
     <l n="953">The shaggy mountain-goat ,</l>
     <l n="954">Perched on the utmost crag ,</l>
     <l n="955">Against the afterglow of lucent ruby ,</l>
     <l n="956">Or , poised with bunching hoofs</l>
     <l n="957">In mid-spring over a dark , yawning chasm ;</l>
     <l n="958">Or the black stallion , with his tameless troop ,</l>
     <l n="959">Fording a mountain-river in the dawn .</l>
     <l n="960">And , sometimes , as we toiled ,</l>
     <l n="961">A terrible fleeting rapture</l>
     <l n="962">Would come upon me , when the Queen</l>
     <l n="963">Passed by us with her maidens ;</l>
     <l n="964">Or paused , a moment , gazing ,</l>
     <l n="965">With tranced and kindling eyes upon our labours :</l>
     <l n="966">But never did I dare , at any time ,</l>
     <l n="967">To lift my eyes to hers ,</l>
     <l n="968">And look , as soul on soul ,</l>
     <l n="969">As on the day her beauty brought to birth</l>
     <l n="970">The strange new life within me .</l>
     <l n="971">In silence she would ever leave us ;</l>
     <l n="972">And ever with her passing perished</l>
     <l n="973">The light and colour of my work ;</l>
     <l n="974">So that my heart failed , daunted by that glimpse</l>
     <l n="975">Of the ever-living beauty .</l>
     <l n="976">And , sometimes , I would carve in ruddy teak ,</l>
     <l n="977">Or ivory , from the Indian merchants bought ,</l>
     <l n="978">Or in the rare , black basalt , little beasts</l>
     <l n="979">To please the idle fancies of the King ;</l>
     <l n="980">Or model in wet clay , and cast in bronze ,</l>
     <l n="981">Great bulls and lions for the palace-courts ;</l>
     <l n="982">Or carve him seals of lapis-lazuli ,</l>
     <l n="983">Of jasper , amethyst and serpentine ,</l>
     <l n="984">Chalcedony — carnelian , chrysoprase ,</l>
     <l n="985">Agate , sardonyx , and chalcedonyx —</l>
     <l n="986">Green jade , and alabaster ;</l>
     <l n="987">Or cut in stones that flashed and flickered</l>
     <l n="988">Like a glancing kingfisher ,</l>
     <l n="989">Or , in the sun-filled amber ,</l>
     <l n="990">The kite with broad wings spread ,</l>
     <l n="991">Or little fluttering doves that pecked</l>
     <l n="992">A golden bunch of dates :</l>
     <l n="993">And then of these in settings of fine gold</l>
     <l n="994">Made fillets , rings and ear-rings .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="995">Thus , one day ,</l>
     <l n="996">Dreaming , as ever , of the Queen ,</l>
     <l n="997">I wrought a golden serpent for her hair :</l>
     <l n="998">And when I brought it to the King , next morn ,</l>
     <l n="999">Where he sat brooding over chess ,</l>
     <l n="1000">He bade me bear it to the Queen , myself ,</l>
     <l n="1001">And so , I went unto her , where she sat ,</l>
     <l n="1002">Among her singing maidens , at the loom ,</l>
     <l n="1003">Weaving a silken web of Tyrian dye .</l>
     <l n="1004">I laid the trinket at her feet , in silence :</l>
     <l n="1005">And she arose , and set it in her hair ,</l>
     <l n="1006">Whose living lustre far outshone</l>
     <l n="1007">The cold , dead metal I had fashioned ,</l>
     <l n="1008">As she stood before me , dreaming ,</l>
     <l n="1009">In her robe of flowing blue ;</l>
     <l n="1010">Then looked a moment on me with kind eyes .</l>
     <l n="1011">And though she spoke no word ,</l>
     <l n="1012">I turned , and fled , in trembling ,</l>
     <l n="1013">Before the light that shivered through me ,</l>
     <l n="1014">And struck my soul with shuddering ecstasy :</l>
     <l n="1015">And , still , through many days ,</l>
     <l n="1016">Although I did not look again</l>
     <l n="1017">Upon those dreaming eyes ,</l>
     <l n="1018">Their visionary light</l>
     <l n="1019">Within my soul , revealed eternity .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="1020">Thus , have the mortal years</l>
     <l n="1021">Flowed onward to the perfect end —</l>
     <l n="1022">This day of days ,</l>
     <l n="1023">That never night shall quench ,</l>
     <l n="1024">Nor darkness vanquish :</l>
     <l n="1025">And , at dawn ,</l>
     <l n="1026">I die .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="1027">And yet , this morning , as I slowly climbed</l>
     <l n="1028">The steep , ascending stages</l>
     <l n="1029">That lead up to the hanging-gardens —</l>
     <l n="1030">Where , tier on tier ,</l>
     <l n="1031">The great brick arches bore</l>
     <l n="1032">Their April wealth of blossoms ,</l>
     <l n="1033">Plumed with palm and dusky cypress —</l>
     <l n="1034">I little knew that I</l>
     <l n="1035">Who came to carve a garland</l>
     <l n="1036">Round a fountain 's porphry basin ,</l>
     <l n="1037">Should scale so soon the utmost peak of life .</l>
     <l n="1038">Throughout the morn I toiled ,</l>
     <l n="1039">Until an hour ere noon —</l>
     <l n="1040">For no one , save the King and Queen ,</l>
     <l n="1041">May walk in those high gardens , after midday —</l>
     <l n="1042">When , underneath a cypress shade ,</l>
     <l n="1043">I paused , a moment , resting ;</l>
     <l n="1044">And looking down upon the basking city ,</l>
     <l n="1045">Beneath me slumbering deeply —</l>
     <l n="1046">Garden on garden glowing , grove on grove ,</l>
     <l n="1047">Like some green fabric , shot with myriad hues ,</l>
     <l n="1048">And chequered with white clusters of flat roofs ,</l>
     <l n="1049">Aquiver in clear heat :</l>
     <l n="1050">And then I gazed up through the aching azure ,</l>
     <l n="1051">At the restless kites that hover</l>
     <l n="1052">Ever over Babylon :</l>
     <l n="1053">And , as I watched one broad-winged bird that hung</l>
     <l n="1054">Above the seven-coloured pyramid</l>
     <l n="1055">Of Bel 's great temple ,</l>
     <l n="1056">With wide pinions spread ,</l>
     <l n="1057">As though it kept eternal vigil over</l>
     <l n="1058">The golden image in the golden shrine ,</l>
     <l n="1059">I thought of eagles poised</l>
     <l n="1060">Above the peaks of glittering snows ,</l>
     <l n="1061">Beyond the Eastern plains .</l>
     <l n="1062">Half-dreaming , thus , I lay ,</l>
     <l n="1063">Lulled by the tinkling waters ,</l>
     <l n="1064">Till , unawares , sleep slowly overcame me ;</l>
     <l n="1065">And noonday drifted by :</l>
     <l n="1066">And still , I slept , unheeding :</l>
     <l n="1067">And , in my sleep ,</l>
     <l n="1068">I looked on Beauty in a quiet place</l>
     <l n="1069">Of forest gloom and immemorial dream :</l>
     <l n="1070">When , something rousing me from slumber ,</l>
     <l n="1071">With waking eyes that yet seemed dream-enchanted ,</l>
     <l n="1072">I looked upon the Queen ,</l>
     <l n="1073">Where , in a secret close ,</l>
     <l n="1074">Set thickly round with screens of yew and ilex ,</l>
     <l n="1075">She stood upon the dark , broad brim</l>
     <l n="1076">Of a wide granite basin , gazing down ,</l>
     <l n="1077">With dreaming eyes , into the glooming cool ,</l>
     <l n="1078">Unraimented , save of the flickering gleam ,</l>
     <l n="1079">Reflected from the lucent waters ,</l>
     <l n="1080">That flowed before her silently :</l>
     <l n="1081">And slowly , from her feet ,</l>
     <l n="1082">The cold light rippled up her body , till ,</l>
     <l n="1083">Entangled in the meshes of her hair ,</l>
     <l n="1084">It flooded the calm rapture of her face :</l>
     <l n="1085">When , dreaming still , she lifted up her eyes ,</l>
     <l n="1086">Unseeing ; and I looked upon her soul ,</l>
     <l n="1087">Unveiled , in naked immortality ,</l>
     <l n="1088">Untrammelled by the trappings of brief time ,</l>
     <l n="1089">And cloaks of circumstance .</l>
     <l n="1090">How long I looked upon the perfect beauty ,</l>
     <l n="1091">I cannot tell —</l>
     <l n="1092">Each moment , flowing to eternity ,</l>
     <l n="1093">Bearing me further from time 's narrow shores ;</l>
     <l n="1094">Though , yet , a little while ,</l>
     <l n="1095">From those unshadowed deeps time sought to hold me .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="1096">Suddenly , I felt</l>
     <l n="1097">A ghostly arrow pierce my life ;</l>
     <l n="1098">And I leapt up , and turning ,</l>
     <l n="1099">I saw the King beside me ,</l>
     <l n="1100">With steely , glittering eyes</l>
     <l n="1101">Shooting barbed anger ,</l>
     <l n="1102">Though he coldly spake ,</l>
     <l n="1103">With evil , curling lips :</l>
     <l n="1104">“ Slave , thou art dead ! ”</l>
     <l n="1105">And yet I did not quail :</l>
     <l n="1106">But , looking ‘ twixt his brows ,</l>
     <l n="1107">I answered : and he blenched before my words :</l>
     <l n="1108">“ Nay ! I have seen :</l>
     <l n="1109">“ And am newborn , a King ! ”</l>
     <l n="1110">And then his craven fingers</l>
     <l n="1111">Went quaking to his wagging beard ,</l>
     <l n="1112">As if he felt my clutch upon his throat :</l>
     <l n="1113">Yet , though , with one quick blow ,</l>
     <l n="1114">I might have hurled him down to death ,</l>
     <l n="1115">I never stirred :</l>
     <l n="1116">And , eyeing me , he summoned</l>
     <l n="1117">The negro-eunuchs , who kept watch below :</l>
     <l n="1118">But I , ere they could spring up the first stage ,</l>
     <l n="1119">Went forth to meet them ;</l>
     <l n="1120">And they bound my wrists .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="1121">And so , down from the hills , my life has flowed ,</l>
     <l n="1122">Until , at fullest flood , it meets the sea .</l>
     <l n="1123">With calm and unregretful heart , I wait</l>
     <l n="1124">Till dawn shall loose the arrow from the bow .</l>
     <l n="1125">I , who , with eager , faltering hand have sought</l>
     <l n="1126">To fashion a little beauty , in the end ,</l>
     <l n="1127">Have looked on the perfect beauty , and I die —</l>
     <l n="1128">Even as the priest , who , in the heart of night ,</l>
     <l n="1129">Trembling before the thunder-riven shrine ,</l>
     <l n="1130">Looks on the face of God , and perishes .</l>
     <l n="1131">I die ...</l>
     <l n="1132">And yet , maybe , when earth lies heavily</l>
     <l n="1133">Upon the time-o'ertoppled towers ,</l>
     <l n="1134">And tumbled walls , and broken gates of brass ;</l>
     <l n="1135">And the winds whisper one another :</l>
     <l n="1136">“ Where , Oh ! where is Babylon ? ”</l>
     <l n="1137">In the dim underworld of dreaming shades ,</l>
     <l n="1138">My soul shall seek out beauty</l>
     <l n="1139">And look , once more ,</l>
     <l n="1140">Upon the unveiled vision ...</l>
     <l n="1141">And not die .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="19">
     <l n="1142">Night passes : and already in the court ,</l>
     <l n="1143">Amid the plash of fountains ,</l>
     <l n="1144">There sounds the pad of naked feet approaching .</l>
     <l n="1145">With slow , deliberate pace ,</l>
     <l n="1146">As though they trod out all my perished years ,</l>
     <l n="1147">The Nubians come , to lead me out to death .</l>
     <l n="1148">Slowly the great door opens ;</l>
     <l n="1149">And clearer comes the call of waters ;</l>
     <l n="1150">Cool airs are on my brow ...</l>
     <l n="1151">Lo ! ... in the East , the dawn .</l>
