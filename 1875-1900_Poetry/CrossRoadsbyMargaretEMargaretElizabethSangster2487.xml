    <head>PREFACE</head>
    <p n="1">The candlelight sweeps softly through the room , Filling dim surfaces with golden laughter , Touching with mystery each high hung rafter , Cutting a path of promise through the gloom .</p>
    <p n="2">Slim little elves dance gently on each taper , Wistful , small ghosts steal out of shrouded corners — And , like a line of vague enchanted mourners , Great shadows sway like wind-blown sheets of paper .</p>
    <p n="3">Gently as fingers drawn across your hair , I see the yellow flicker of it creep — And in a silence that is kin to sleep , I feel a world away from pain and care .</p>
    <p n="4">Roads stretch like arms across the world outside , Roads reach to strife , to happiness , to fame — Here , in the candlelight , I speak your name , Here we are at life 's cross way , side by side !</p>
    <p n="5">OH , THERE ARE BROOKS THERE , AND FIELDS THERE AND NOOKS THERE — NOOKS WHERE A SEEKER MAY FIND FOREST FLOWERS ; BLUE IS THE SKY THERE , AND SOFT WINDS CREEP BY THERE , SINGING A SONG THROUGH THE LONG SUMMER HOURS .</p>

   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="2">The woods lay dreaming in a topaz dream ,</l>
     <l n="3">And we , who silently roamed hand in hand ,</l>
     <l n="4">Were pilgrims in a strange , enchanted land ,</l>
     <l n="5">Where life was love , and love was all a-gleam .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="6">And old remembered songs came back to greet</l>
     <l n="7">Our ears , from other worlds of long ago ,</l>
     <l n="8">The worlds that we of earth may seldom know —</l>
     <l n="9">And to those songs we timed our vagrant feet .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="10">We did not speak , we did not need to say</l>
     <l n="11">The thought that lay so buried in our hearts —</l>
     <l n="12">The thoughts as sweet as springtime rain , that</l>
     <l n="13">starts</l>
     <l n="14">The buds to blossoming in wistful May .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="15">We did not need to speak , we could not speak ,</l>
     <l n="16">The wonder words that we in silence knew —</l>
     <l n="17">We walked , as very little children do ,</l>
     <l n="18">Who feel , but cannot tell , the thing they seek .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="19">Beyond a screen of bushes , bending low ,</l>
     <l n="20">We knew that fair Titania lay at rest ,</l>
     <l n="21">Her pillowed head upon her lover 's breast ,</l>
     <l n="22">Her kisses swift as birds that come and go !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="23">And underneath a wall of mottled stone ,</l>
     <l n="24">We knew the sleeping beauty lay in state ,</l>
     <l n="25">Entangled in a mist of tears , to wait</l>
     <l n="26">The prince whose kiss would raise her to a throne .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="27">Perhaps a witch with single flaming eye ,</l>
     <l n="28">Was watching from beneath the hemlock tree ;</l>
     <l n="29">And fairies that our gaze might never see ,</l>
     <l n="30">Laughed at us as we , hand in hand , crept by .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="31">Laughed at us ? No , I somehow think they knew</l>
     <l n="32">That you and I were kin to them that day !</l>
     <l n="33">I think they knew that we were years away</l>
     <l n="34">From everything but make-believe , come true .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="35">I think they knew that , singing through the air ,</l>
     <l n="36">There thrilled a vague , insistent , harp-like call —</l>
     <l n="37">And that , where woodbine blazed against the wall ,</l>
     <l n="38">You held me close and kissed my wind-tossed hair !</l>

     <l n="1">I took th ’ horses to th ’ brook — to water ‘ em you know ,</l>

     <l n="3">And as we went a-joggin ’ down I could n't help but</l>

     <l n="12">Perhaps I 'd like it — for awhile — to hear th ’ songs an ’</l>

     <l n="15">I 'd feel th ’ country callin ’ me ; I 'd long again fer</l>

  <p>AT DAWN</p>
   <p>I . THE CAVEMAN</p>
   <p>I live ! And the scarlet sunrise is climbing the mountain steep , I live ... And below , in the caverns , the rest of my clansmen sleep ; But I — I am here , and chanting , I could slay a beast with my hand , And I thrill as the mist of the morning creeps up from the rock-strewn land !</p>
   <p>I live , I have strength for fighting — and courage to rend and slay , I live ! And my eyes are lifting to gaze at the new - born day ; And I pause , on the way to my hewn-out cave , though I know that she waits me there , My mate , with her eyes on the scarlet dawn , and the wind in her flame-like hair .</p>
   <p>I live — and the joy of living leaps up in my searching eyes , I live , and my soul starts forward , to challenge the waking skies ! Far down are the torrents roaring , far up are the clouds , unfurled ; And I stand on the cliff , exultant , akin to the waking world .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">The mists are gone , and an eagle sweeps down from</l>
     <l n="2">the mountain high ,</l>
     <l n="3">And I wish that my arms were feathered and strong ,</l>
     <l n="4">that I , too , might fly ;</l>
     <l n="5">I live ! I am one with the morning ! Ah , I am a</l>
     <l n="6">MAN , and free !</l>
     <l n="7">And I shout aloud , and the scarlet dawn shouts back ,</l>
     <l n="8">on the gale , to me !</l>

     <head>II . THE PIONEER</head>
     <lg type="stanza" n="2">
      <l n="9">I creep along , but silently ,</l>
      <l n="10">For , oh , the dawn is coming ;</l>
      <l n="11">I creep along , for I have heard</l>
      <l n="12">A flint-tipped arrow , humming ;</l>
      <l n="13">And I have heard a snapping twig ,</l>
      <l n="14">Above the wind 's low laughter ;</l>
      <l n="15">And I have known — and thrilled to know ,</l>
      <l n="16">That swift THEY followed after !</l>

      <l n="17">The forest turns from black to grey ,</l>
      <l n="18">The leaves are silver-shining ;</l>
      <l n="19">But I have heard a far-off call —</l>
      <l n="20">The war-whoop 's sullen whining .</l>
      <l n="21">And I have been a naked form ,</l>
      <l n="22">Among the tree trunks prowling ;</l>
      <l n="23">And I have glimpsed a savage face ,</l>
      <l n="24">That faded from me , scowling .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="4">
      <l n="25">A rosy color sweeps the sky ,</l>
      <l n="26">A vagrant lark is singing ,</l>
      <l n="27">But , as I steal along the trail ,</l>
      <l n="28">I know that day is bringing</l>
      <l n="29">A host of red-skins in its train ,</l>
      <l n="30">Their tommy-hawks are gleaming —</l>
      <l n="31">I SEE THEM NOW ; or can it be</l>
      <l n="32">The first pale sunlight beaming ?</l>
     </lg>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>I creep along , but stealthily , For , oh , the dawn is coming ! I creep along — but I have heard A flint-tipped arrow , humming .... And yet , my heart is light , inside , My soul , itself , is flying To greet the dawn ! I AM ALIVE — AND WHAT IS DEATH — BUT DYING ?</p>

    <p>THE HAUNTED HOUSE</p>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="34">It stands neglected , silent , far from the ways of men ,</l>
     <l n="35">A lonely little cottage beside a lonely glen ;</l>

     <l n="45">The ghost of childish laughter rings on the narrow</l>

     <l n="48">Steals out , and then a love song , and then a bugle</l>
     <l n="49">call ,</l>
     <l n="50">And steps that do not falter along the quiet hall .</l>

    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Where the sumac grows in a flaming wall , It stands , at the end of a little lane , And there do the children come again , Answering , still , the bell 's shrill call , Just as we came , with their songs unsung , And their hopes all new , and their dreams dew kissed , Brave as the sun in a land of mist — JUST AS WE CAME WHEN THE WORLD WAS YOUNG !</p>

     <head>III . THE ORGAN MAN</head>
     <lg type="stanza" n="17">
      <l n="78">He 's very old , his music box is old and rusty , too ,</l>
      <l n="79">And half the notes of it are harsh , and half of</l>
      <l n="80">them are slow ;</l>
      <l n="81">One wonders if the coat he wears could ever have</l>
      <l n="82">been new —</l>
      <l n="83">And if the tune he plays was quite forgotten long</l>
      <l n="84">ago .</l>
     </lg>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>He finds a sunny place to stand , and lifts his bleary eyes , And smiles a bit — a toothless smile half touched , perhaps , with fear ; And though he cannot see them he is looking at the skies , As if he prays , but silently , for hope and faith and cheer .</p>
   <p>The foreign women pass him by , their tarnished coins held tight , They toss their heads and will not hear his music 's wistful hum — But through each alley way and street , like moths that seek the light , With eager eyes and laughing lips the little chil - dren come .</p>
   <p>He plays his ancient , shaky song , his mouth moves to its sway , He does not know the tune of it is old and out of key ; For , through his eyes , a soul stares out that wanders far away , In some fair land of youth and love — some land that used to be .</p>
   <p>The little children cluster close , bareheaded , bare of limb — They hold their ragged frocks and dance , they do not care — or know , That they are like a garden place , a fragrant dream to him , Or that the tune he plays was quite forgotten long ago .</p>
   <p>“ BE OF GOOD CHEER ! ”</p>

     <l n="10">And all the world is vividly a-glow ,</l>
     <l n="11">You cannot make me pause to question why</l>
     <l n="12">For we who dare to dream have learned to know !</l>

   <p>THE WORLD IS RIGHT ! There is a friendly One Who smiles when we have tried to do our part — I will not flinch , my journey 's just begun .... I AM MYSELF — YOU CANNOT BREAK MY HEART !</p>

   <p>ALL ALONG THE BROAD HIGHWAY</p>
   <p>All along the broad highway the little dreams were growing , White as hope , and red as life , and bluer than the sea — All along the broad highway I felt their petals blowing , Like a storm of fragrant snow across the lips of me ! So I danced with joyous heart , and bent above them singing . So I skipped along the road and smiled into the skies ; ALL ALONG THE BROAD HIGHWAY THE LITTLE DREAMS WERE SPRINGING , FRAGRANT AS THE DEW OF STARS AND GLAD AS BUTTERFLIES !</p>
   <p>All along the broad highway I danced and sang unheeding , Till One came with haughty step and traveled by my side ; Traveled first beside my path then , suddenly , was leading — One who drew me after him and murmured , “ I AM PRIDE ! ” All along the broad highway I hurried , ever faster , Faster through the purple dust that blinded like a mist , Blinded me until I felt that only Pride was master , ( And I saw the little dreams through clouds of amethyst ! )</p>
   <p>All along the broad highway I toiled , no longer glancing Anywhere but straight ahead ... I had no heart to sing — All along the broad highway , my feet no longer dancing ; Followed I the steps of Pride , and felt the thick dust sting In the tired eyes of me ... the eyes too sad for weeping ! Still I struggled — struggled on until quite suddenly — All the strength that kept me up seemed drowsy , almost sleeping — And I paused with drooping head and lo , Pride went from me !</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">All along the broad highway the silent dusk was</l>
     <l n="2">stealing ,</l>
     <l n="3">Quite alone I stood and stared about me in the</l>
     <l n="4">gloom ;</l>
     <l n="5">And the voice of me was still , and my heart was</l>
     <l n="6">kneeling</l>
     <l n="7">Like a weary pilgrim soul in an attic room .</l>
     <l n="8">And I stretched my empty hands to where the ghostly</l>
     <l n="9">lighting ,</l>
     <l n="10">Showed a crumpled mist of blue , a heap of white</l>
     <l n="11">and red —</l>
     <l n="12">There along the broad highway like armies after</l>
     <l n="13">fighting ,</l>
     <l n="14">All the gallant little dreams were lying gaunt and</l>

   <p>I had not meant to love again — all that was lost to me , For I had felt love 's fear and pain , as well as ecstasy ; I closed my heart , and locked the door , and tossed away the key .</p>
   <p>All through the winter-time I sat before my flaming fire , And listened to the sleigh-bells chime , and watched the flames leap higher , To grasp at shadows , sombre-hued , with fiendish , red desire .</p>
   <p>And then mad April came again — I felt the breezes blowing , And I forgot the fear , the pain .... I only knew that , glowing , In shady nook and garden spot , pale hyacinths were growing .</p>
   <p>And when across the perfumed lea ( for nothing could defeat him ! ) My vagrant love crept back to me ... I did not mean to greet him ; But April opened up my heart , and , oh , I ran to meet him !</p>

     <l n="16">And every hill with its gentle slope</l>
     <l n="17">Led up to heights I had dreamed and prayed</l>
     <l n="18">To reach some day —</l>
     <l n="19">Ah ! I might have stayed</l>
     <l n="20">With Love and Youth in the garden gay ,</l>
     <l n="21">That smiled at me from beside the way .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>I plodded up , and the gentle hills Grew hard to climb , and the laughing rills Were torrents peopled with sodden forms ; The sky grew black with the threat of storms , And rocks leaped out and they bruised my feet , And faint I grew in the fever heat . ( But ever on led the path that lay As grey as dust in the waning day . ) My back was bent , and my heart was sore , And the cloak of pride that I grandly wore Was rent and patched and not fair to see — Ambition , talent , seemed naught to me .... But I struggled on ‘ till I reached the top , FOR ONLY THEN DID I DARE TO STOP !</p>
   <p>I stood on the summit gazing down , And the earth looked sordid and dull and brown , And neutral-tinted and neutral-souled ; And all of life seemed a story told , And the only spot that was bright to see Was a patch of green that had bloomed for me Where a garden lived in a spring long fled , When Love stood smiling — BUT LOVE WAS DEAD !</p>

     <l n="14">That clung about you has been swept aside ....</l>
     <l n="15">Your room is there — but , oh , its soul has died !</l>

   <p>THERE ARE SUCH WEARY LITTLE LINES</p>
   <p>There are such weary little lines about the mouth of you , Such tragic little mirthless lines — they mock at dreams come true , And twist your lips when you would smile , until all joy is dead , And I , who want to laugh with you , am fain to weep instead !</p>
   <p>There are such dreary little lines about the mouth of you , They make me want to whisper that summer sky is blue , And that the rain is like a lance of silver through the air , And that the flowers in the lane are growing tall and fair !</p>
   <p>There are such tired little lines about the mouth of you — As if you thought that life was cold and loving friends were few .... They are such lonely little lines I think that I , some day , Will creep close to you in the dusk , and kiss them quite away !</p>

     <l n="2">Lay , like a stone , upon my bursting heart ;</l>
     <l n="3">It seemed as if no shimmering tomorrow</l>
     <l n="4">Could dry the tears that you had caused to start .</l>
     <l n="5">You left me , never telling why you wandered —</l>
     <l n="6">Without a word , without a last caress ;</l>
     <l n="7">Left me with but the love that I had squandered ,</l>
     <l n="8">The husks of love and a vast loneliness .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>And yet if you came back with arms stretched toward me , Came back to-night , with carefree , smiling eyes , And said : “ My journeying has somehow bored me , And love , though broken , never , never dies ! ” I would forget the wounded heart you gave me , I would forget the bruises on my soul . My old-time gods would rise again to save me , My dreams would grow supremely new and whole . What though youth lay , a tattered garment , o'er you ? Warm words would leap upon my lips , long dumb ; If you came back , with arms stretched out before you , AND TOLD ME , DEAR , THAT YOU WERE GLAD TO COME !</p>

   <p>I have heard the shriek of the great shells speak to the dawn of a flaming day ; And a growling gun when the fight was won , and the twilight flickered gray , I have seen men die with their chins raised high , and a curse that was half a prayer — I have fought alone when a comrade 's groan was tense on the blinding air .</p>
   <p>I have tramped a road when a burning load was strapped to my aching back , Through miles of mud that was streaked with blood , when my closing eyes turned back — I have cried aloud to a heedless crowd of a God that they could not know , And have knelt at night when the way was bright with a rocket 's sullen glow .</p>
   <p>I am going home through the whirling foam — home to her arms stretched wide — I am going back to the beaten track and the sheltered fireside , With gasping breath I have sneered at death , and have mocked at a shell 's swift shirr , And safe again , through the years of pain , I am going back — to HER !</p>
   <p>I am coming back with a singing soul through the surge of the splendid sea , Coming back — BUT MY SINGING SOUL WILL NEVER BE QUITE FREE — For I have killed , and my heart has thrilled to the call of the battle hum .... I am coming back to the used-to-be — But , God , do I want to come ?</p>

     <l n="8">And build their altars new again , and then —</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Give them the vivid youth that they have sought for Through bloody mists on bloody fields of strife ; Show them the gallant truth that they have fought for ; Show them , anew , the better things of life . God of the hosts , blot out the months of pain — And let them have their boyhood back again . AMEN .</p>

   <p>The windows glow with many jewels , with rubies fire-entangled , And glowing bits of emerald , and diamonds like the dew — But , Paris , can you quite forget the bodies lying mangled Beneath the snow on Flanders fields — your lost who call to you ? ) .</p>
   <p>The windows of each little shop are gay with gem - like laughter , With rings to fit milady 's hand , and drops to deck her ear ; ( But , Paris , can you quite forget Verdun , and Ypres , and — after ? And , far beneath the sounds of mirth , one wonders what you hear . )</p>
   <p>The windows glow with countless jewels , the shop - girls stop to wonder , The little shopgirls who are still , so many , dressed in black — ( But , oh , the saddened hearts of them no doubt are lying under Some sandy stretch along the Marne , where grim defeat turned back ! )</p>
   <p>The windows gleam enticingly , and eyes light up to see them , For Paris thrills to loveliness , as Paris always thrilled — ( Oh , God of beauty , touch the lives that war has crushed , and free them From broken dreams , an empty faith , and hopes forever stilled ! )</p>

   <p>Yes , it was Marie Antoinette — she walked with steady tread , She sauntered down the marble steps with proudly lifted head ; And there were those among the crowd who watched with indrawn breath , To see a queen walk out with smiles to keep a tryst with death !</p>
   <p>I stood beside those marble steps just yesterday , and saw , A bride upon a soldier 's arm — a poilu brave who wore A Croix de Guerre upon his breast — and oh , they smiled above The busy throng that hurried by , unconscious of their love .</p>
   <p>And though , across the mist of years , I glimpsed a fair queen 's face , A face that smiled , but scornfully , above her land 's disgrace — I will remember , on those steps , the little new-made wife , Who came , her eyes all filled with trust , to keep her tryst with life .</p>

     <l n="40">Just a little wisp of song played softly in the twilight ,</l>

     <l n="1">Now that the tumult of the war is over ,</l>
     <l n="2">The fairy folk are coming back to France ;</l>
     <l n="3">They push their way through tangled grass and</l>

     <l n="5">To find the ring where once they used to dance .</l>
     <l n="6">They come half-wistfully , the little people ,</l>
     <l n="7">Through broken town , and battered market place ,</l>
     <l n="8">They come past shell-torn church with shattered</l>

     <l n="11">They come with packs of dreams , with love and</l>

     <l n="14">They come with promises for ever after ,</l>
     <l n="15">Tied neatly into bundles on their backs !</l>
     <l n="16">They bring the seeds of magic so that flowers ,</l>
     <l n="17">The flowers of new happiness and mirth ,</l>
     <l n="18">May bloom , once more , in sweet enchanted bowers ,</l>
     <l n="19">Above the heart-ache of a tortured earth .</l>

     <l n="20">Now that the angry powder smoke has vanished ,</l>

     <l n="22">The fairy folk that hate and war had banished ...</l>
     <l n="23">They pause beside a loosely swinging door ,</l>
     <l n="24">To set it right on hinges that were breaking ,</l>
     <l n="25">They lift an old rag doll with tender care ,</l>
     <l n="26">And hurry on — because their hearts are aching ,</l>
     <l n="27">For one-time childish faces that were there .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="28">They cross forgotten meadows in the gloaming ,</l>
     <l n="29">Through forest aisles at even-time they creep ;</l>
     <l n="30">Where trenches were , their little feet are roaming ,</l>
     <l n="31">And where the heroes of the conflict sleep ,</l>
     <l n="32">They stop , a moment , wistful — and their singing</l>
     <l n="33">Dies down into the semblance of a prayer ;</l>
     <l n="34">And tiny bells in far-off elf land ringing ,</l>
     <l n="35">Sound , like a silver promise , on the air .</l>

   <p>NOW THAT THE TUMULT OF THE WAR IS OVER , ONCE MORE THE COUNTRY WAKENS TO ROMANCE ; FOR , THROUGH THE TANGLE OF THE GRASS AND CLOVER , THE FAIRY FOLK ARE COMING BACK TO FRANCE .</p>

   <p>Dear God , they will not come again , those lads of ours , Who left this land so gallantly to do their best — And so I ask that You will send gay springtime flowers , To deck each shell-torn meadow where their bodies rest . I ask that You will let them hear the joyous singing , Of some deep-throated bird whose heart tones throb and swell ; God , let them feel the thrill that Easter time is bringing , That death is only life asleep — and all is well ! AMEN .</p>
   <p>INDEPENDENCE DAY — 1919</p>
   <p>Over the mists of a century they come , and their tramping feet Are light as the dust on the broad highway , or the wind that sways in the wheat ; Out of the haze of the years between their shadowy hands stretch wide To welcome the heroes home again who have fought for their cause and died .</p>
   <p>They went to battle at Concord Bridge , and they fell on Bunker Hill ; The odds were great , but they struggled on with a stubborn Yankee will ; They lay in the fields at Lexington when the sun in the west was red , And the next year 's violets grew on the spot where their valiant blood was shed .</p>
   <p>But they won in the end — with their broken guns and without much food to spare , Won at the end of a bitter war , by means that they knew were fair ; And some of them wandered back to their plows , and some lay wrapped in the loam , And slept the sleep of the fearless heart that has fought at home — for home !</p>
   <p>Fought for their homes , at home , they did — but these other boys today Fought for the homes of stranger folk three thousand miles away ; FOUGHT FOR THE HONOR OF THE WORLD , and were not afraid to die In a muddy trench , in a foreign land , and under a foreign sky !</p>
   <p>They fought on the Marne , at Belleau Wood ; they swept through the mad Argonne ; Chateau-Thierry was theirs to take ; they took it and then surged on ; And now that the fight they fought is won , though they lie in a far-off grave , Their souls come back to the land they loved — the land that they LEFT to save .</p>
   <p>And so , through the damp of the sorry sea , through the wreck of the shell-torn plain , They are coming back to homes they loved — they are coming back again ! And light as the wind that sways in the wheat , or the dust on the broad highway , They march to their rendezvous with the ones who died in the yesterday .</p>
