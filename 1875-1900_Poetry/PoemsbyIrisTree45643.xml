     <p>Winding down the street in wearied gaiety , the barrel-organ dribbled out its song Merged with the thud of feet forever dallying indifferent and indefinite along . The houses stood like rows of cripples , some paralysed , some hunch-backed and some bent with age , They seemed at war , their chimneys threatening , their brows hung heavy in a sombre rage . Crab-like the children crawled , while always hammering above their heads the scolding shrewish tongue ; They grew as bloodless flowers unflourishing , waxen and pale from out the dust and dung . Above I saw the strip of sunset fluttering , even as washed-out rags upon the line , I listened to the sparrows twittering , and the hours ticking in a slow decline . Then beaded on the hem of evening , the coloured lights were threaded here and there , Till proud with sweets and plumes and oranges , the shops grew brilliant in the tinsel glare . Grey was the death-bed of the twilight , shuddering the faint hands of the day stretched to the night , Fending it off , or feebly wavering over the pallid glints of stolen light . And grey the faces that were gathering among the fallen ashes of the day , And red the faces , yellow , flickering , under the lamps upon the long highway . And some were gashed with smiles , and quaint grimaces of hate and pain and hunger and despair , And some wore coloured hats and meek frivolities , limp ribbons , and false pansies in their hair , But all were cold , and all seemed passionless ; there shone no zest or splendour in their lives , Nor hope in anything but holidays , or watching funerals , or taking wives . I dared not think , for truth rose horrible , slapping the face with coarse uncaring hand , But like them cheated into merriment , I wilfully refused to understand ; Turned me away from wan-eyed poverty , trod pity underfoot , oh , danced on grief , Bade the crowd sing and fill my desolation , bade them be glad and hide my disbelief .</p>
     <p>Strange we so love the world — for presently , out of my window looking on the city , I blessed the night , and the roofs slumbering all huddled , and I felt no shame nor pity For all our dusty days of journeying amid the wreck and ruins of our dreams , Meandering in a bleared forgetfulness , where lethe laps the wharf of sleeping streams . I only breathed the air , intensified by the ascending breath of million lungs , And heard the labouring metropolis , quickened by whispers of a million tongues ; And felt a king of splendid loneliness , and felt an atom of the peopled spaces , And felt again my lordly egoism , one face distinct among the blur of faces .</p>

      <head>ZEPPELINS</head>
      <head>MIDNIGHT</head>
       <l n="1">Suddenly</l>
       <l n="2">Shutting our lips upon a jest</l>
       <l n="3">As we are sipping thoughts from little glasses ,</l>
       <l n="4">A gun bursts thunder and the echoing streets</l>
       <l n="5">Quiver with startled terrors —</l>
       <l n="6">How swift runs fear : quicksilver that is free !</l>
       <l n="7">Now every muscle weakens , every pulse</l>
       <l n="8">Is set at gallop-pace and every nerve</l>
       <l n="9">Stretched taut with horror and a wild revolt ....</l>
       <l n="10">How sweetly spins the world to noise of music ,</l>
       <l n="11">How sweet to live life 's arrogant adventure !</l>
       <l n="12">Live in a vain world wracked with a thousand pangs ,</l>
       <l n="13">Limp in a dull street housed with crumbling dreams ,</l>
       <l n="14">To breathe and eat and sleep and love and sigh</l>
       <l n="15">A little longer , oh a little year !</l>
       <l n="16">Forgotten prayers rise up in resurrection ,</l>
       <l n="17">And resolutions of new wondrous lives</l>
       <l n="18">Choke up our hearts and fling us to our knees ....</l>
       <l n="19">Worms creep in dreadful hunger from the ground ,</l>
       <l n="20">The lurid silent people loved by death ,</l>
       <l n="21">And peer into our eyes with sly forebodings</l>
       <l n="22">To drag our body 's glory from the light .</l>
       <l n="23">Though all the world should fall into their cells</l>
       <l n="24">And lie within their larders shelf on shelf —</l>
       <l n="25">Yet will I toss the sheets of dust away ,</l>
       <l n="26">Yet will I be the mistress of the sun !</l>
     </lg>

      <head>1 A. M .</head>
       <l n="1">Look how they struggle in a mist of fire ,</l>
       <l n="2">Those hunchbacked chimneys and distorted domes —</l>
       <l n="3">Now gloat on Hell , the colour seems to roar ,</l>
       <l n="4">An army fierce upon its own destruction ,</l>
       <l n="5">A famished monster tearing in its claws</l>
       <l n="6">Gigantic foods to glut its lean desire</l>
       <l n="7">Digesting all the world !...</l>
       <l n="8">Look at the eager people open-mouthed</l>
       <l n="9">That stand as foolish rabbits hypnotised</l>
       <l n="10">By the uncoiling rhythm of a snake ,</l>
       <l n="11">Their earth adoring senses caught awhile</l>
       <l n="12">In the red whirlwind of ascending wings ;</l>
       <l n="13">Their spirits straining upward upon strings</l>
       <l n="14">Like kites and air balloons , but more grotesque ,</l>
       <l n="15">Lacking the ephemeral beauty of a toy —</l>
       <l n="16">Yet for an hour</l>
       <l n="17">Dyed with the colour that their drabness fears</l>
       <l n="18">They kiss the feet of beauty as she passes</l>
       <l n="19">Starwards , tremendous in a coat of fire .</l>

       <l n="1">The dawn seems drained of blood so colourless —</l>
       <l n="2">Slowly the river moves as though in sleep</l>
       <l n="3">While silent barges</l>
       <l n="4">Slide from the mist like dreams ;</l>
       <l n="5">The intricate patterns of the scaffolding</l>
       <l n="6">Are drawn against the sky</l>
       <l n="7">More delicate than lace .</l>
       <l n="8">All the shimmering lights</l>
       <l n="9">Have shrunk away from morning</l>
       <l n="10">As a blue peacock sheaves his starry tail ....</l>
       <l n="11">I am alone , most utterly alone ,</l>
       <l n="12">More lonely than the last man in the world</l>
       <l n="13">Straying amid the dust of vanished lives .</l>
       <l n="14">More lonely than a spirit stolen from heaven</l>
       <l n="15">Who stands beside that nebulous cold river</l>
       <l n="16">Dividing sleep from death ,</l>
       <l n="17">Eternity from time ....</l>
       <l n="18">Nothing disturbs the white peace of the dawn ,</l>
       <l n="19">She brings no feverous memories of night</l>

       <l n="21">Only two hours ago</l>
       <l n="22">Fire walked in crimson armour through the city</l>
       <l n="23">Piercing the night 's black tent with glittering javelins ,</l>
       <l n="24">While shrieks and whispered omens flew like bats</l>
       <l n="25">Among the silver foliage of the stars ....</l>
       <l n="26">But rage has left no furrow in the sky ,</l>
       <l n="27">No wake of sparks across the placid water ....</l>
       <l n="28">This is the ominous and sacred hour</l>
       <l n="29">When priest-like the world kneels</l>
       <l n="30">Bowed low toward the empty throne of day —</l>
       <l n="31">Soon will the herald trumpet-blast be heard</l>
       <l n="32">And the flamingo messengers will come</l>
       <l n="33">Flocking from out the burnished cage of sunrise ....</l>
       <l n="34">This is the hour of nothing ,</l>
       <l n="35">Colourless and chill</l>
       <l n="36">Oblivion 's hands are folded on the world ,</l>
       <l n="37">As sits an idol holding in his fingers</l>
       <l n="38">A scentless lotus carven out of stone .</l>

     <p>From the fathomless depth of my boredom , from the last room of its emptiness , an elf has come to play with me .</p>
     <p>As comes a little gold spider to a prison cell teasing the criminal from his darkness to tear at a thread of sunlight , and kiss the mouth of a shy morning whispering through the window .</p>
     <p>An elf has come to dance with me , blown like a leaf on the path of my autumn lassitude .</p>
     <p>Sprightly one , dervish ! You are the living adventure born of my dead childhood , you are the small god in the temples of my unbelief , you are the bird that nests in ruined temples , laying your silver eggs by moonlight and singing when the pagan birds are still .</p>
     <p>You are the dream-sower in the fields of sleep , you have jingled the star-bells on the hood of darkness , and from the knarled , stark tree of time have flung me the apple of eternal laughter .</p>
     <p>1919</p>
     <p>Lolling in snow , like kings in ermine coats , the gilt-crowned bottles lie .... Our thoughts are dangled in a laughter of leaves as bunches of blue and yellow grapes for faery beggars , for ragged fancies to pluck and taste .</p>
     <p>Our music shall be the minstrelsy of ghostly ballad-mongers that have stolen from the ashen banquets of death to bless our revels .</p>
     <p>Our spirits shall flit like those winged faces of cherubs that never can alight , but swing forever on the azure ribbons of the sky .</p>
     <p>And all our dreams and kisses shall be as the rose-leaves falling on ancient festivals , as the shadows of rose-leaves falling on phantom lovers in the sleep-pillared temples of our first archaic passion .</p>
     <p>1918</p>
     <p>The roots of our longing are probing the heart of night , delving and twining together that our ultimate truth may grow out of the darkness that bewilders and nourishes . Out of the earth , the dust , the crystals of frost that bind themselves like a tight crown over our heads .</p>
     <p>Through the mould and the frost our hair and fingers shall prick their spears of pallor and flame , and in the green ardour of our up-rushing leaves the red goblets of fire shall open , and masses of white flowers , milky as the star-sprays that droop over Heaven , shall splash their bright foam from the darkness , as waves that rise and break into a fountain of blossoms .</p>

      <head>TO MY MOTHER</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">At evening when the twilight curtains fall ,</l>
       <l n="2">Before the lamps are lit within my room ,</l>
       <l n="3">My memories hang bright upon the gloom ,</l>
       <l n="4">Like ancient frescoes painted on the wall .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="5">And I can hear the call of birds and bells</l>
       <l n="6">And shadowy sound of waves , and wind through leaves</l>
       <l n="7">And wind that rustles through the burnished sheaves ,</l>
       <l n="8">And far off voices whispering farewells .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="9">I dream again the joy I used to know</l>
       <l n="10">While straying by the sea that hardly sighed</l>
       <l n="11">A sorrow in my singing , as the tide</l>
       <l n="12">Crept up to clasp me , smiled , and let me go .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="13">And I remember all the glad lost hours ,</l>
       <l n="14">The racing of brown rabbits on the hill ,</l>
       <l n="15">The winds that prowled around the lonely mill ,</l>
       <l n="16">Laburnum laughter , music of the flowers .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="17">The berries plucked with loitering delight ,</l>
       <l n="18">Staining the dusk with purple , till the thought</l>
       <l n="19">Of starry little ghosts behind us caught</l>
       <l n="20">Our hearts and made us fearful of the night .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="21">The London evenings huddled in the rain</l>
       <l n="22">Whose misty prisms shone with lamplight pale ,</l>
       <l n="23">Making our hearts seem sinister and frail ,</l>
       <l n="24">Fainting our thoughts with mystery and pain .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="25">I have a world of memories to dream ,</l>
       <l n="26">To touch with loving fingers as a sigh</l>
       <l n="27">Revives a little flame and lets it die .</l>
       <l n="28">Ah , were the days as lovely as they seem</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="29">Now that they look so peaceful lying dead ?</l>
       <l n="30">And is it all the hope of Joy we have ,</l>
       <l n="31">The broken trophies of the things she gave</l>
       <l n="32">And took away to give us dreams instead ?</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="9">
       <l n="33">The things we love and lose before we find</l>
       <l n="34">The way to love them well enough and keep ,</l>
       <l n="35">That now are woven on the looms of sleep</l>
       <l n="36">That now are only music of the wind .</l>

       <l n="38">London grows sad at evening ,</l>
       <l n="39">And we at the windows sit</l>
       <l n="40">To watch her moods ,</l>
       <l n="41">Wearying with her .</l>
       <l n="42">Even a noise of laughter from the street</l>
       <l n="43">Sounds in our ears</l>
       <l n="44">Like something dropped and shattered on the stone .</l>
       <l n="45">Then her musician comes ,</l>
       <l n="46">A wandering , malicious spirit ;</l>
       <l n="47">The organ grinder , playing those old tunes</l>
       <l n="48">We know too well ,</l>
       <l n="49">That hurt us with fatigue .</l>
       <l n="50">Till Hope like a harlequin ,</l>
       <l n="51">His glitter hidden in a ragged coat ,</l>
       <l n="52">The lamplighter , goes by ,</l>
       <l n="53">Planting his pale flames in the dusk .</l>

       <l n="55">Ah ! the spring ,</l>
       <l n="56">Sudden , surprising ,</l>
       <l n="57">Melting the iron scales around the heart</l>
       <l n="58">As the earliest sun</l>
       <l n="59">Melts the cold case of dew on leaves —</l>
       <l n="60">Ah ! the streets like odorous rivers</l>
       <l n="61">Chanting the echoes of seas —</l>
       <l n="62">Ah ! the flowers in shop-windows</l>
       <l n="63">Beseeching , persuasive ,</l>
       <l n="64">Reluctant to let their beauty flow away</l>
       <l n="65">From thoughts that mirror them in passing —</l>
       <l n="66">Beautiful exiles</l>
       <l n="67">Fluttering in their chains ,</l>
       <l n="68">Thrilled with the noise of bees ,</l>
       <l n="69">The music of meadows</l>
       <l n="70">Still hovering around them —</l>
       <l n="71">Flower fingers , flower-touches ,</l>
       <l n="72">Passional , reminiscent ,</l>
       <l n="73">Rippling the soul 's still waters —</l>
       <l n="74">Flower galaxies ,</l>
       <l n="75">Enamelled bridges arching from dream to dream ,</l>
       <l n="76">Garlands splashing over the eyes of satyrs ,</l>
       <l n="77">The furtive woodland eyes ,</l>
       <l n="78">The pointed inquisitive ears —</l>
       <l n="79">Pallid flowers foaming on hill-crests ,</l>
       <l n="80">Gushing heavenwards</l>
       <l n="81">From a sea of stormy mountains —</l>
       <l n="82">Opening and shutting exquisite doors ,</l>
       <l n="83">As the senses open to music ,</l>
       <l n="84">Shut upon silence ,</l>
       <l n="85">Open to beauty ,</l>
       <l n="86">Close their caskets upon love —</l>
       <l n="87">Ah ! the flowers in the windows ,</l>
       <l n="88">Amorous of poets</l>
       <l n="89">Making a chaplet of song !</l>

      <head>THE UNDERTONE OF THE VOLGA BOAT SONG</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">O God ,</l>
       <l n="2">We have nothing to give Thee ,</l>
       <l n="3">We are as fog that drifts on the river ,</l>
       <l n="4">As the wailing of voices blown through mist —</l>
       <l n="5">We are as those that carry bags of dust</l>
       <l n="6">Heaping them with the dust —</l>
       <l n="7">We are covered with the dust of days ,</l>
       <l n="8">We are pale from the dust of dreamless nights</l>
       <l n="9">Shaken before we were rested —</l>
       <l n="10">At dawn we are found by the sun</l>
       <l n="11">Adrift , labouring , thinking of nothing —</l>
       <l n="12">Our wine is bitter , it has made us drunk ,</l>
       <l n="13">Our bread is coarse ,</l>
       <l n="14">We are always athirst and hungry ....</l>
       <l n="15">O God , we have been patient ,</l>
       <l n="16">We have grown old in weariness ,</l>
       <l n="17">Our lives are as the labouring of the wind —</l>
       <l n="18">We are huddled together in the dawn ,</l>
       <l n="19">The sleeping houses pass us ,</l>
       <l n="20">The dawn is a field of nettles</l>
       <l n="21">Stinging us from rest ....</l>
       <l n="22">O God ,</l>
       <l n="23">We have nothing to give Thee but patience ,</l>
       <l n="24">We have suffered evil and believed Thee good ,</l>
       <l n="25">Thy face is the gentleness of the distance ,</l>
       <l n="26">The river is placid with the thought of Thee —</l>
       <l n="27">Our tears have washed us harder than the rocks ,</l>
       <l n="28">And like the rocks we wait ,</l>
       <l n="29">Grow old with waiting ....</l>
       <l n="30">Weariness , the river</l>
       <l n="31">Flowing through banks of sleep ....</l>
       <l n="32">O God , we have nothing to give Thee ,</l>
       <l n="33">Take our great weariness ,</l>
       <l n="34">We that have never lived and never slept ,</l>
       <l n="35">Take our long weariness , O God !...</l>
