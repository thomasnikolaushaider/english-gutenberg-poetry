    <head>CONTENTS The Seed Shop Man and his Makers The New Aspasia A Song For Old Love Sic Transit Mrs. Effingham 's Swan Song Annunciation Boys Bathing Lady Hamilton White Magic In the Orchard The Wood and the Shore The Tryst Leda The Harebell Words Shrift The Thief of Beauty Forgotten Dead , I Salute You Madala Goes by the Orphanage Obsession Enough In Memory of Douglas Vernon Cow The Cloudberry To —— For Fasting Days The Father Andromeda Unfettered THE SEED SHOP . Here in a quiet and dusty room they lie , Faded as crumbled stone or shifting sand , Forlorn as ashes , shrivelled , scentless , dry — Meadows and gardens running through my hand . Dead that shall quicken at the call of Spring , Sleepers to stir beneath June 's magic kiss , Though birds pass over , unremembering , And no bee seek here roses that were his . In this brown husk a dale of hawthorn dreams A cedar in this narrow cell is thrust That will drink deeply of a century 's streams , These lilies shall make summer on my dust . Here in their safe and simple house of death , Sealed in their shells a million roses leap ; Here I can blow a garden with my breath , And in my hand a forest lies asleep . MAN AND HIS MAKERS .</head>
    <list type="contents">
     <item>1 . I am one of the wind 's stories , I am a fancy of the rain ,— A memory of the high noon 's glories , The hint the sunset had of pain .</item>
     <item>2 . They dreamed me as they dreamed all other ; Hawthorn and I , I and the grass , With sister shade and phantom brother Across their slumber glide and pass .</item>
     <item>3 . Twilight is in my blood , my being Mingles with trees and ferns and stones ; Thunder and stars my lips are freeing , And there is sea-rack in my bones .</item>
     <item>4 . Those that have dreamed me shall out-wake me , But I go hence with flowers and weeds ; I am no more to those who make me Than other drifting fruit and seeds .</item>
     <item>5 . And though I love them — mourn to leave them — Sea , earth and sunset , stars and streams , My tears , my passing do not grieve them ... Other dreams have they , other dreams . THE NEW ASPASIA . If I have given myself to you and you , And if these pale hands are not virginal , Nor these bright lips beneath your own lips true , What matters it ? I do not stand nor fall By your old foolish judgments of desire : If this were Helen 's way it is not mine ; I bring you beauty , but no Troys to fire : The cup I hold brims not with Borgia 's wine . You , so soon snared of sudden brows and breasts , Lightly you think upon these lips , this hair . My thoughts are kinder : you are pity 's guests : Compassion 's bed you share . It was not lust delivered me to you ; I gave my wondering mouth for pity 's sake , For your strange , sighing lips I did but break Many times this bread , and poured this wine anew . My body 's woven sweetness and kindling hair Were given for heal of hurts unknown of me , For something I could slake but could not share . Sudden and rough and cruel I let you be , I gave my body for what the world calls sin , Even as for your souls the Nazarene Gave once . Long years in pity I and He Have served you — Jesus and the Magdalen . As on the river in the fading light A rust-red sail across the evening creeps , Torching the gloom , and slowly sinks from sight , The blood may rise to some old face at night , Remembering old sins before it sleeps . So might you hence recall me , were I true To your sad violence . Were I not free So me you might remember now ; but you Were no more loved by me Than clouds at sunset , or the wild bird going About his pleasure on the apple tree , Or wide-blown roses swelling to the bee ; No sweeter than flowers suddenly found growing In frost-bound dells , or , on the bare , high hills , The gold , unlaced , dew-drunken daffodils Shouting the dawn , or the brown river flowing Down quietly to the sea ; Or day in twilight 's hair bound safe and dim , Stirless in lavender , or the wind blowing , Tumbling the poppy 's turban after him . I knew you as I knew these happy things , Passing , unwept , on wide and tranquil wings To their own place in nature ; below , above Transient passion with its stains and stings . For this strange pity that you knew not of Was neither lust nor love . Do not repent , nor pity , nor regret . I do not seek your pardon , nor give you mine . Pass by , be silent , drop no tears , forget . Return not , make no sign When I am dead , nor turn your lips away From Phryne 's silver limbs and Faustine 's kiss . I need no pity . No word of pity say . I have given a new sweet name and crown to this That served men 's lust and was Aspasia . A SONG FOR OLD LOVE . There shall be a song for both of us that day Though fools say you have long outlived your songs , And when , perhaps , because your hair is grey , You go unsung , to whom all praise belongs , And no men kiss your hands — your fragile hands Folded like empty shells on sea-spurned sands . And you that were dawn whereat men shouted once Are sunset now , with but one worshipper , Then to your twilight heart this song shall be Sweeter than those that did your youth announce For your brave beautiful spirit is lovelier Than once your lovely body was to me . Your folded hands and your shut eyelids stir A passion that Time has crowned with sanctity . Young fools shall wonder why , your youth being over , You are so sung still , but your heart will know That he who loved your soul was your true lover And the last song alone was worthy you . SIC TRANSIT — “ What did she leave ? ” ... Only these hungry miser-words , poor heart ! Not “ Did she love ? ” “ Did she suffer ? ” “ Was she sad From this green , bright and tossing world to part ? ” No word of “ Do they miss her ? do they grieve ? ” Only this wolf-thought for the gold she had ... “ What did she leave ? ” MRS. EFFINGHAM 'S SWAN SONG . I am growing old : I have kept youth too long , But I dare not let them know it now . I have done the heart of youth a grievous wrong , Danced it to dust and drugged it with the rose , Forced its reluctant lips to one more vow . I have denied the lawful grey , So kind , so wise , to settle in my hair ; I belong no more to April , but September has not taught me her repose . I wish I had let myself grow old in the quiet way That is so gracious .... I wish I did not care . My faded mouth will never flower again , Under the paint the wrinkles fret my eyes , My hair is dull beneath its henna stain , I have come to the last ramparts of disguise . And now the day draws on of my defeat . I shall not meet The swift , male glance across the crowded room , Where the chance contact of limbs in passing has Its answer in some future fierce embrace . I shall sit there in the corners looking on With the older women , withered and overblown , Who have grown old more graciously than I , In a sort of safe and comfortable tomb Knitting myself into Eternity . And men will talk to me because they are kind , Or as cunning or as courtesy demands ; There will be no hidden question in their eyes And no subtle implication in their hands . And I shall be so grateful who have been So gracious , and so tyrannous , moving between Denial and surrender . To-morrow I shall find How women live who have no lovers and no answer for life 's grey monotonies . Upon my table will be no more flowers , They will bring me no more flowers till I am dead ; There will be no violent , sweet , exciting hours , No wild things done or said . Yet sometimes I 'm so tired of it all — This everlasting battle with the flesh , This pitiful slavery to the body 's thrall — And then I do not want to lure or charm , I want to wear Soft , easy things , be comfortable and warm ; I want to drowse at leisure in my chair . I do not want to wear a veil with heavy mesh , Or sit in shaded rooms afraid to face the light ; I do not want to go out every night , And be bright and vivid and intense , Nor be on the alert and the defence With other women , fierce and afraid as I , Drawing a knife unseen as each goes by . I am so tired of men and making love , For every one 's the same . There 's nothing new in love beneath the sun ; All love can say or do has long been said and done : I have eaten the fruit of knowledge long enough , Been over-kissed , over-praised and over-won . Why should I try to play still the old , foolish game ? Because I have played the rose 's part too long . Who plays the rose must pay the rose 's price , And be a rose or nothing till it dies . And even then sometimes the blood will answer fierce and strong To the old hunger , to the old dance , old tune ; I shall feel cruel and passionate and mad Though I have lost the look of June . The fever of the past will burn my hands As men who live long in intemperate lands Feel the old ague wring them , far removed From the old dreadful glitter of seas and sands . The rose dies hard in women who have had Lovers all their lives , and have been much loved . I am afraid to grow old now even if I would . I have fought too well , too long , and what was once A foolish trick to make the rose more strangely gay Is now a close-locked , mortal conflict of brain and blood — A feud too old to settle or renounce . I shall grow too tired to struggle , and the fight will end , And they will enter in at last — Nature and Time , long thwarted of their prey , Those old grey two , more cruel for the lips that said them “ Nay , ” For the bitterest foe is he who in the past Has been repulsed when he would fain be friend . I am sorry for women who are growing old , I do not blame them holding youth with shameful hold , Or doing desperate things to lips and eyes . They have so pitifully short a flowering time , So suddenly sweet a story so soon told . They only strive to keep what men have taught them most to prize — Men who have longer , fuller lives to live , Who are not stopped and broken in their prime , With their faces still to summer , Men do not know What Age says to a woman . They would not wait To feel slip from their hands without a throe , Without a struggle , futile and desperate , All that has given them wealth and love and power Doomed , without hope or rumour of reprieve . They would not smile into the eyes of that advancing hour Who had bent all summer to their bow , and had flung The widest rose and kissed the keenest mouth And slept in the lordliest bed when they were young . That bitter twilight which sun-worshipping Youth Flies headlong keeps Age loitering on the hill , Uneager to fold such greyness to his breast , Knowing that none will thwart him of his will , None be before him on that quest . I am growing old . I was not always kind when I was young To women who were old , for Youth is blind — A small , green , bitter thing beneath its fragrant rind , And fanged against the old with boisterous tongue — Those whose poor morning heads are touched with rime , Walking before their misery like kings . I did not think that I should feel such stings , Nor flinch beneath such arrows . But now I know . One day I shall be stupid and rather slow , And easily cowed and troubled in my mind , And tremulous , vaguely frightened , feeble and cold . I am growing old .... My God ! how old , how old ! ... I dare not tell them , but one day they will know ... I hope they will be kind . ANNUNCIATION . “ The Lord appeared in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush and behold , the bush burned with fire and the bush was not consumed . ” — EXODUS iii . 2 . When to your virgin heart , unstirred , ungiven , Upon the quiet mountain side untrod , The sudden naked fire came down from heaven , Burning you with the very breath of God , Was the sun lost ? Were all the sweet stars dim While God raised round your head those walls of light ? Were you locked dumbly , terribly with Him , Within that burning temple day and night ? What was it to have God there like a bird — God like a great , gold flower upon your breast — While He spake things that only one man heard , Face down before that glory manifest ? When that strange flame went up the mountain side , Were your forsaken lips so burned with gold That the creatures of the wild stood off and cried , And in your breast no blossom dared unfold ? Did you call back the startled birds to build , And put forth all your simple buds again , Forgetting how your branches once were filled , In sweet embrace of passing sun and rain ? Or were all other birds forbidden sing After those great , gold plumes had made their nest ? Was , in its strange and awful blossoming , That great , gold flower the last upon your breast ? BOYS BATHING . Round them a fierce , wide , crazy noon Heaves with crushed lips and glowing sides Against the huge and drowsy sun . Beneath them turn the glittering tides Where dizzy waters reel with gold , And strange , rich trophies sink and rise From decks of sunken argosies . With shining arms they cleave the cold Far reaches of the sea , and beat The hissing foam with flash of feet Into bright fangs , while breathlessly Curls over them the amorous sea . Naked they laugh and revel there . One shakes the sea-drops from his hair , Then , singing , takes the bubbles : one Lies couched among the shells , the sands Telling gold hours between his hands : One floats like sea-wrack in the sun . The gods of Youth , the lords of Love , Greeks of eternal Thessaly , Mocking the powers they know not of , Naked and unembraced and free ! To whom the Siren sings in vain To-day , to-morrow who shall be The destined sport of gods and men . Unseen the immortal ones are here , Remembering their mortal loves — The strange , sweet flesh , the lips that were Frail and most perishably fair . Diana leaves her whispering groves , And of Actaeon dreams and sighs , And hears the hounds bay in the wood . Oh , Cythera , the trembling blood Upon one petal 's paling mouth Before thee and this noon must rise While thou remember Adon 's eyes ! One mournful and complaining shade Beyond Avernus bows his head , Dreaming of one beloved youth Borne from him , lost and dazed and dead , Dragged by the nymphs ’ avenging hair Into the sea-bed oozing dim , In that cold twilight unaware Of each great sunrise over him . One day , while still these waters run , And noon still heaves beneath this sun , You shall creep , unremembering , Whom Life has humbled and subdued , Ruined your bodies , tamed your blood , No more the lords of anything . But spent and racked with mortal pains , The slow tide pushing through your veins , Coldly you face this magic shore ; For you the disenchanted noon Scarce haunted is with ghosts that were Once , and were you , and are no more . Faltering against the wind and sun That vainly seek your hair for gold , Stubborned with habit , grey and old , You know not why you wander here , Nor what vague dream pursues you still , For Life has taken fullest toll Of all your beauty ; on each soul Love 's hand has left his bitter mark , Has had of you his utmost will , And thrusts you headlong to the dark . And colder than these waters are The stream that takes your limbs at last : Earth 's vales and hills drift slowly past ... One shore far off , and one more far . LADY HAMILTON . Men wondered why I loved you , and none guessed How sweet your slow , divine stupidity , Your look of earth , your sense of drowsy rest , So rich , so strange , so all unlike my sea . After the temper of my sails , my lean Tall masts , you were the lure of harbour hours ,— A sleepy landscape warm and very green , Where browsing creatures stare above still flowers . These salt hands holding sweetness , the leader led , A slave , too happy and too crazed to rule , Sea land-locked , brine and honey in one bed , And England 's man your servant and your fool ! My banqueting eyes foreswore my waiting ships ; I was a silly landsman at your lips . WHITE MAGIC . Is it not a wonderful thing to be able to force an astonished plant to bear rare flowers which are foreign to it ... and to obtain a marvellous result from sap which , left to itself , would have produced corollas without beauty ?— VIRGIL . I stood forlorn and pale , Pressed by the cold sand , pinched by the thin grass , Last of my race and frail Who reigned in beauty once when beauty was , Before the rich earth beckoned to the sea , Took his salt lips to taste , And spread this gradual waste — This ruin of flower , this doom of grass and tree . Each Spring could scarcely lift My brows from the sand drift To fill my lips with April as she went , Or force my weariness To its sad , summer dress : On the harsh beach I heard the grey sea rise , The ragged grass made ceaseless , dim lament , And day and night scarce changed the mournful skies . Foot on the sand , a shadow on the sea ! A face leaned over me . Across each wasted limb Passed healingly a warm , great , god-like hand . I was drawn up to him , From my frail feet fell the last grains of sand . Then haste and darkness stooped and made me theirs ; Deep handed me to deep ;... I faded then as names fade from men 's prayers ,— As a sigh from lips at last made friends with sleep . But the same hand that bore me from the sea , Waking me tenderly , Bound me to a rough stranger of my race ,— Me weary and pale to him and him to me . I turned my piteous face Aside ashamed ; I struggled to be free . I slept , I dreamed , I woke to that embrace ! ... Sweet tides stole through my veins , Strange fires and thrills and pains ; To my cold lips the bloom crept back once more I glowed as a bride glows ; I watched the days with delicate hands restore My kinship with the rose . About my throat my hair went like a flame , My brows were wreathed , in purple I was dressed , I bore a new bride 's name , A great star burned my breast . No longer bound , I leaned the same sweet way As even a great Queen may Towards her lover . Now astonished I Who was a beggar stand obediently Beside Cophetua . IN THE ORCHARD . “ I thought you loved me . ” “ No , it was only fun . ” “ When we stood there , closer than all ? ” “ Well , the harvest moon “ Was shining and queer in your hair , and it turned my head . ” “ That made you ? ” “ Yes . ” “ Just the moon and the light it made “ Under the tree ? ” “ Well , your mouth , too . ” “ Yes , my mouth ? ” “ And the quiet there that sang like the drum in the booth . “ You should n't have danced like that . ” “ Like what ? ” “ So close , “ With your head turned up , and the flower in your hair , a rose “ That smelt all warm . ” “ I loved you . I thought you knew “ I would n't have danced like that with any but you . ” “ I did n't know . I thought you knew it was fun . ” “ I thought it was love you meant . ” “ Well , it 's done . ” “ Yes , it 's done . “ I 've seen boys stone a blackbird , and watched them drown “ A kitten ... it clawed at the reeds , and they pushed it down “ Into the pool while it screamed . Is that fun , too ? ” “ Well , boys are like that ... Your brothers ... ” “ Yes , I know . “ But you , so lovely and strong ! Not you ! Not you ! ” “ They do n't understand it 's cruel . It 's only a game . ” “ And are girls fun , too ? ” “ No , still in a way it 's the same . “ It 's queer and lovely to have a girl ... ” “ Go on . ” “ It makes you mad for a bit to feel she 's your own , “ And you laugh and kiss her , and maybe you give her a ring , “ But it 's only in fun . ” “ But I gave you everything . ” “ Well , you should n't have done it . You know what a fellow thinks “ When a girl does that . ” “ Yes , he talks of her over his drinks “ And calls her a — ” “ Stop that now . I thought you knew . ” “ But it was n't with anyone else . It was only you . ” “ How did I know ? I thought you wanted it too . “ I thought you were like the rest . Well , what 's to be done ? ” “ To be done ? ” “ Is it all right ? ” “ Yes . ” “ Sure ? ” “ Yes , but why ? ” “ I do n't know . I thought you were going to cry . “ You said you had something to tell me . ” “ Yes , I know . “ It was n't anything really ... I think I 'll go . ” “ Yes , it 's late . There 's thunder about , a drop of rain “ Fell on my hand in the dark . I 'll see you again “ At the dance next week . You 're sure that everything 's right ? ” “ Yes . ” “ Well , I 'll be going . ” “ Kiss me ... ” “ Good night . ” ... “ Good night . ” THE WOOD AND THE SHORE . The low bay melts into a ring of silver , And slips it on the shore 's reluctant finger , Though in an hour the tide will turn , will tremble , Forsaking her because the moon persuades him . But the black wood that leans and sighs above her No hour can change , no moon can slave nor summon . Then comes the dark ; on sleepy , shell-strewn beaches , O'er long , pale leagues of sand , and cold , clear water She hears the tide go out towards the moonlight . The wood still leans ... weeping she turns to seek him , And his black hair all night is on her bosom . THE TRYST . I raised the veil , I loosed the bands , I took the dead thing from its place . Like a warm stream in frozen lands My lips went wandering on her face , My hands burnt in her hands . She could not stay me , being dead ; Her body here was mine to hold . What if her lips had lost their red ? To me they always tasted cold With the cold words she said . Did my breath run along her hair , And free the pulse , and fire the brain , My wild blood wake her wild blood there ? Her eyelids lifted wide again In a blue , sudden stare . Beneath my fierce , profane caress The whole white length of body moved ; The drowsy bosom seemed to press As if against a breast beloved , Then fail for weariness . No , not that anguish ! Christ forbid That I should raise such dead ! I rose , Stifled the mouth with lilies , hid Those eyes , and drew the long hair close , And shut the coffin lid . My cold brow on the cold wood laid , Quiet and close to-night we lie . No cruel words her lips have said . I shall not take nor she deny . The dead is with the dead . LEDA . Do you remember , Leda ? There are those who love , to whom Love brings Great gladness : such thing have not I . Love looks and has no mercy , brings Long doom to others . Such was I . Heart breaking hand upon the lute , Touching one note only ... such were you . Who shall play now upon that lute Long last made musical by you ? Sharp bird-beak in the swelling fruit , Blind frost upon the eyes of flowers . Who shall now praise the shrivelled fruit , Or raise the eyelids of those flowers ? I dare not watch that hidden pool , Nor see the wild bird 's sudden wing Lifting the wide , brown , shaken pool , But round me falls that secret wing , And in that sharp , perverse , sweet pain That is half-terror and half-bliss My withered hands are curled on pain That were so wide once after bliss . And gold is springing in my hair As my thoughts spring and flower with it , Though I sit hid in my grey hair , Without love or the pain of it . Yet , oh my Swan , if love have wings , As the gods tell us , you were love Who took and broke me with those wings . I , weak , and being far gone in love Let blushless things be breathed and done — Things flowered out now in bitter fruit That once done are no more undone Than last year 's frost and last year 's fruit . For what has come of love and me Who knew the first joy that loving is ? Where has love led and beckoned me But to the end where nothing is ? I have seen my blood beat out again Red in the hands of all my line , My sin has swelled and flowered again Corrupt and fierce through Sparta 's line . Bred through me — bred through delicate hands And wandering eyes and wanton lips , Sighing after strange flesh as sighed these lips , Straying after new sin as strayed these hands . Mother of Helen ! She whose breasts To new desires unshaped the world ; Above Troy 's summit towered these breasts , Helen who wantoned with the world ! Helen is dead ( she had love enough To laugh at doom and mock at shrine ) And Clytemnestra , quiet enough To-night beneath Apollo 's shrine . And I am left , the source , the spring Of all their madness . They are dead While I still sit here , the old spring That fouled them flows above the dead . But I have paid . I have borne enough . I am very old in love and woe . For all souls these things are enough — Who have known love are the friends of woe . There those who love , and who escape , There are those who love and do not die . I loved , and there was no escape , Long since I died and daily die . And death alone makes hate and love Friends with each other and with sleep ... All 's quiet here that once was love , This that is left belongs to sleep . THE HAREBELL . You give no portent of impermanence Though before sun goes you are long gone hence , Your bright , inherited crown Withered and fallen down . It seems that your blue immobility Has been for ever , and must for ever be . Man seems the unstable thing , Fevered and hurrying . So free of joy , so prodigal of tears , Yet he can hold his fevers seventy years , Out-wear sun , rain and frost , By which you are soon lost . WORDS . Is it not brave to be a king , Techelles !— Usumcasane and Theridamas , Is it not passing brave to be a king , And ride in triumph through Persepolis ?— MARLOWE . Bring the great words that scourge the thundering line With lust and slaughter — words that reek of doom And the lost battle and the ruined shrine ;— Words dire and black as midnight on a tomb ; Hushed speech of waters on the lip of gloom ; Huge sounds of death and plunder in the night ;— Words whose vast plumes above the ages meet , Girdling the lost , dark centuries in their flight , The slave of their unfetterable feet . Bring words as pure as rills of earliest Spring In some far cranny of the hillside born To stitch again the earth 's green habiting ;— Words lonely as the long , blue fields of morn ;— Words on the wistful lyre of winds forlorn To the sad ear of grief from distance blown ; Thin bleat of fawn and airy babble of birds ; Sounds of bright water slipping on the stone Where the thrilled fountain pipes to woodland words . Bring passionate words from noontide 's slumber roused , To slake the amorous lips of love with fruit , Dripping with honey , and with syrups drowsed To draw bee-murmurs from the dreaming lute — Words gold and mad and headlong in pursuit Of laughter ; words that are too sweet to say And fade , unsaid , upon some rose 's mouth ;— Words soft as winds that ever blow one way , The summer way , the long way from the south . For such words have high lineage , and were known Of Milton once , whose heart on theirs still beats ; Marlowe hurled forth huge stars to make them crown ; They are stained still with the dying lips of Keats ; As queens they trod the cloak in Shakespeare 's streets ; Pale hands of Shelley gently guard their flame ; Chatterton 's heart was burst upon their spears : Their dynasty unbroken , and their name Music in all men 's mouths for all men 's ears . But now they are lost , their lordliest ‘ scutcheon stained ; Upon their ruined walls no trumpet rings ; Their shrines defiled , their sacraments profaned : Men crown the crow , they have given the jackal wings . Slaves wear the peplum , beggars ride as kings . They couple foolish words and look for birth Of mighty emperor , Christ or Avatar , They mate with slaves from whom no king comes forth ; No child is theirs who follow not the Star . Lyric Apollo ! Thou art worshipped still ! We quest for beauty on Thy hills like hounds , Let these poor rhymers babble as they will , Filling their pipes with shrill and crazy sounds . Poets still praise Thee , music still abounds , And Beauty knows the hour of Thy return , For the Gods live albeit temples burn , Suffer the fools their folly , let them be , Wreathing each other with their wreaths of straw , Trailing their pageants of the mud ; but we Await Thy laurel on our brows with awe . And if Thou wreathe not , let us still be found Thy slaves : Thou dost not bind unworthy things . Them hast Thou chained not . Better heads uncrowned Than mock regalia of the rabble 's kings ! SHRIFT . I am not true , but you would pardon this If you could see the tortured spirit take Its place beside you in the dark , and break Your daily food of love and kindliness . You 'd guess the bitter thing that treachery is , Furtive and on its guard , asleep , awake , Fearing to sin , yet fearing to forsake , And daily giving Christ the Judas kiss . But piteous amends I make each day To recompense the evil with the good ; With double pang I play the double part Of all you trust and all that I betray . What long atonement makes my penitent blood , To what sad tryst goes my unfaithful heart ! THE THIEF OF BEAUTY . The mind is Beauty 's thief , the poet takes The golden spendthrift 's trail among the blooms Where she stands tossing silver in the lakes , And twisting bright swift threads on airy looms . Her ring the poppy snatches , and the rose With laughter plunders all her gusty plumes . He steals behind her , gathering , as she goes Heedless of summer 's end certain and soon ,— Of winter rattling at the door of June . When Beauty lies hand-folded , pale and still , Forsaken of her lovers and her lords , And winter keeps cold watch upon the hill Then he lets fall his bale of coloured words . At frosty midnight June shall rise in flame , Move at his magic with her bells and birds ; The rose will redden as he speaks her name , He shall release earth 's frozen bosom there , And with great words shall cuff the whining air ! FORGOTTEN DEAD , I SALUTE YOU . Dawn has flashed up the startled skies , Night has gone out beneath the hill Many sweet times ; before our eyes Dawn makes and unmakes about us still The magic that we call the rose . The gentle history of the rain Has been unfolded , traced and lost By the sharp finger-tips of frost ; Birds in the hawthorn build again ; The hare makes soft her secret house ; The wind at tourney comes and goes , Spurring the green , unharnessed boughs ; The moon has waxed fierce and waned dim : He knew the beauty of all those Last year , and who remembers him ? Love sometimes walks the waters still , Laughter throws back her radiant head ; Utterly beauty is not gone , And wonder is not wholly dead . The starry , mortal world rolls on ; Between sweet sounds and silences , With new , strange wines her beakers brim He lost his heritage with these Last year , and who remembers him ? None remember him : he lies In earth of some strange-sounding place , Nameless beneath the nameless skies , The wind his only chant , the rain The only tears upon his face ; Far and forgotten utterly By living man . Yet such as he Have made it possible and sure For other lives to have , to be ; For men to sleep content , secure . Lip touches lip and eyes meet eyes Because his heart beats not again : His rotting , fruitless body lies That sons may grow from other men . He gave , as Christ , the life he had — The only life desired or known ; The great , sad sacrifice was made For strangers ; this forgotten dead Went out into the night alone . There was his body broken for you , There was his blood divinely shed That in the earth lie lost and dim . Eat , drink , and often as you do , For whom he died , remember him .</item>

     <head>MADALA GOES BY THE ORPHANAGE .</head>
     <lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="2">Unaware of its terror ,</l>
       <l n="3">And but half aware</l>
       <l n="4">Of the world 's beauty near her —</l>
       <l n="5">Of sunlight on the stones ,</l>
       <l n="6">And trembling birds in the square ,</l>
       <l n="7">Lightly went Madala —</l>
       <l n="8">A rose blown suddenly</l>
       <l n="9">From Spring 's gay mouth ; part of the Spring was she .</l>
       <l n="10">Warmed to her delicate bones ,</l>
       <l n="11">Cool in its linen her skin ,</l>
       <l n="12">Her hair up-combed and curled ,</l>
       <l n="13">Lightly she flowered on the sin</l>
       <l n="14">And pain of the Spring-struck world .</l>
       <l n="15">Down the street went crazy men ,</l>
       <l n="16">The winter misery of their blood</l>
       <l n="17">Budding in new pain</l>
       <l n="18">While beggars whined beside her ,</l>
       <l n="19">While the streets ’ daughters eyed her ,—</l>
       <l n="20">Poor flowers that kept midsummer</l>
       <l n="21">With desperate bloom , and thrust</l>
       <l n="22">Stale rose at each newcomer ,</l>
       <l n="23">And crime and hunger and lust</l>
       <l n="24">Raged in the noisy dust .</l>
       <l n="25">Lightly went Madala ,</l>
       <l n="26">Unshaken still of that spell ,</l>
       <l n="27">Coral beads and jade to buy ,</l>
       <l n="28">While her thoughts roamed easily —</l>
       <l n="29">Thoughts like bees in lavender ,—</l>
       <l n="30">Thoughts gay and fragile as a robin 's shell .</l>
       <l n="31">Till suddenly she had come</l>
       <l n="32">To grim age-stubborned wall</l>
       <l n="33">Behind whose mask of bars</l>
       <l n="34">Starts up in shame the Foundlings ’ Hospital . *</l>
       <l n="35">At the gates to watch her pass</l>
       <l n="36">A caged thing eyed her dumb ,</l>
       <l n="37">Most mercifully unaware</l>
       <l n="38">Of its own hurt , but Madala</l>
       <l n="39">Stopped short of Spring that day .</l>
       <l n="40">The air grew pinched and wan ,</l>
       <l n="41">A hand came over the sun ,</l>
       <l n="42">Birds huddled , stones went grey .</l>
       <l n="43">Her lace and linen white</l>
       <l n="44">Seemed but her body 's sin ,</l>
       <l n="45">Her flesh unscarred and bright</l>
       <l n="46">Burnt like a leper 's skin .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="47">Her mouth was stale with bread</l>
       <l n="48">Flung her by strangers , she was fed ,</l>
       <l n="49">Housed , fathered by the State , and she had grown</l>
       <l n="50">A thing belonging to , and loved by , none .</l>
       <l n="51">Though the shut mouth said no word ,</l>
       <l n="52">From the caged thing she heard ,</l>
       <l n="53">“ Who has wronged me , that this Spring</l>
       <l n="54">“ Gives me nothing and you everything ,</l>
       <l n="55">“ Who alike were made ,</l>
       <l n="56">“ Who beckon the same dreams ?</l>
       <l n="57">“ You buy coral and jade ,</l>
       <l n="58">“ I sew long hungry seams</l>
       <l n="59">“ To pay for charity ... ”</l>
       <l n="60">Then Madala 's heart , afraid ,</l>
       <l n="61">Cried the first selfish cry :</l>
       <l n="62">“ Is it my fault ? Can I</l>
       <l n="63">“ Help what the world has done ?</l>
       <l n="64">“ Can the flower in the shade</l>
       <l n="65">“ Blame the flower in the sun ? ”</l>
       <l n="66">Then quick the caged thing said ,</l>
       <l n="67">As if to ask pardon that its words had made</l>
       <l n="68">Madala 's spring so spoiled for her that day :</l>
       <l n="69">“ But there 's a way , a way !</l>
       <l n="70">“ If flowers would share their Spring</l>
       <l n="71">“ There 'd be sunshine enough for all the flowers .</l>
       <l n="72">“ Such sunshine you could bring ,</l>
       <l n="73">“ Such joy that swings and flies</l>
       <l n="74">“ With posies your hours through ,</l>
       <l n="75">“ So just beyond my hours .</l>
       <l n="76">“ If I could walk with you —</l>
       <l n="77">“ Not in pitiful two by two</l>
       <l n="78">“ Flayed by free children 's eyes ,</l>
       <l n="79">“ Your sister for an hour to be ,</l>
       <l n="80">“ It would double joy and woo</l>
       <l n="81">“ Spring back to you , and more than Spring to me . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="82">Then something quaked in Madala ,</l>
       <l n="83">Quaked with magic , quaked with awe .</l>
       <l n="84">Love-quickening , she became a part</l>
       <l n="85">Of this caged thing , she was aware</l>
       <l n="86">Of strange lips tugging at her heart .</l>
       <l n="87">So clear the way was ! Tenderer</l>
       <l n="88">Grew her eyes , and as they grew ,</l>
       <l n="89">Back to the flowers rushed the dew ,</l>
       <l n="90">The earth filled out with the sun ,</l>
       <l n="91">The cold birds in the square</l>
       <l n="92">Unbundled and preened upon</l>
       <l n="93">Their twigs in the softening air ;</l>
       <l n="94">The cold wind dwindled and dropped ,</l>
       <l n="95">And love and the world were one .</l>
       <l n="96">Nearer drew Madala ,</l>
       <l n="97">At the dumb thing she smiled ,</l>
       <l n="98">And Spring that a child had stopped</l>
       <l n="99">Came back from the eyes of a child .</l>

       <l n="1">To twilight heads comes Death as comes a friend ,</l>
       <l n="2">As with the gentle fading of the year</l>
       <l n="3">Fades rose , folds leaf , falls fruit , and to their end</l>
       <l n="4">Unquestioning draw near ,</l>
       <l n="5">Their flowering over , and their fruiting done ,</l>
       <l n="6">Fulfilled and finished and going down with the sun .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="7">But for June 's heart there is no comforting</l>
       <l n="8">When her full-throated rose</l>
       <l n="9">Still quick with buds , still thrilling to the air ,</l>
       <l n="10">By some stray wind is tossed ,</l>
       <l n="11">Her swelling grain that goes</l>
       <l n="12">Heavy to harvesting</l>
       <l n="13">In a black gale is lost ,</l>
       <l n="14">And her round grape that purpled to the wine</l>
       <l n="15">Is pinched by some chance frost .</l>
       <l n="16">Ah , then cry out for that lost , lovely rose ,</l>
       <l n="17">For the stricken wheat , and for the finished vine !</l>
       <l n="18">Such were you who sleep now , who have foregone</l>
       <l n="19">So many of Life 's rich secrets almost learned ;</l>
       <l n="20">Winning so much , so much as yet unwon ,</l>
       <l n="21">Yet to be dared , to discover , to reveal .</l>
       <l n="22">Quick still with ardour , hand still at the wheel</l>
       <l n="23">On wide and unsailed seas , eyes turning still</l>
       <l n="24">Towards the morning , while the keen brain burned</l>
       <l n="25">To the imperative will .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="26">Upon your summer Death seems to set his heel ,</l>
       <l n="27">Writes on the page “ No more , ”</l>
       <l n="28">And brings the sign of sunset , shuts the door</l>
       <l n="29">And the house is dark and the tired mourners sleep .</l>
       <l n="30">Yet says he too , “ Though quiet at last you lie ,</l>
       <l n="31">“ And have done with laughter and strife and joy and care ,</l>
       <l n="32">“ You have honour with your peace ; and still you keep</l>
       <l n="33">“ Fullness of life and of felicity .</l>
       <l n="34">“ You have seen the Grail . What need you of grey hair ?</l>
       <l n="35">“ There are those who daily die ,</l>
       <l n="36">“ Who have long out lived their welcome in the world ,</l>
       <l n="37">“ Who are old and sad and tired and fain to cease</l>
       <l n="38">“ From the crowded earth , and the hours in tumult whirled ,</l>
       <l n="39">“ Urgent and vain . You are not such as these</l>
       <l n="40">“ Who have striven for laurels , and never knew the shade</l>
       <l n="41">“ Upon their brows , who would persuade the rose ,</l>
       <l n="42">“ And never have come near it ; till the head</l>
       <l n="43">“ Bows and the heart breaks , and the spirit knows</l>
       <l n="44">“ Only its failure , dim and featureless ,—</l>
       <l n="45">“ Its weariness of all things dreamed and done ,</l>
       <l n="46">“ When love and grief alike seem emptiness</l>
       <l n="47">“ And fame and man 's unrecognition one . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="48">The full tide took you . You went out with the sun ,</l>
       <l n="49">Not in the cringing ebb , not in the grey</l>
       <l n="50">And tremulous twilight , when each lonely one</l>
       <l n="51">To its last loneliness must creep away .</l>
       <l n="52">Your genius has won its rich repose ,</l>
       <l n="53">Full laurelled , wearing still the unfaded rose .</l>
       <l n="54">And as those who bid good-bye at snowdrop time</l>
       <l n="55">Bear with them broken promises of Spring ,</l>
       <l n="56">So you in triumph ,— in the glory men had in you ,</l>
       <l n="57">In Love 's full worshipping ,—</l>
       <l n="58">High summer thoughts , untouched of Winter 's rime ,</l>
       <l n="59">Went forth with honour , having fulfilled your Spring .</l>
       <l n="60">The hands that built you felt you flower from her prayer ,</l>
       <l n="61">True to her vision true ;</l>
       <l n="62">Fearless and fine , shaped from her fashioning ;</l>
       <l n="63">Hands empty now , and yet not all unfilled ,</l>
       <l n="64">Having built and fired the generous heart and brain ,</l>
       <l n="65">Of the man you were ; whose fervent spirit willed</l>
       <l n="66">You to the service and healing and help of men .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="67">These things are hers , not to be lost nor changed</l>
       <l n="68">With changes of death ; for though the body die</l>
       <l n="69">The golden deed is stamped eternally</l>
       <l n="70">With the head of God . The new and alien years</l>
       <l n="71">Leave it still bright , unaltered , unestranged .</l>
       <l n="72">Almost too proud , and too profound for tears</l>
       <l n="73">Is the high memory that the desolate heart</l>
       <l n="74">Shrines and is dumb , yet may for ever keep</l>
       <l n="75">Unforbidden , the imperishable part ,</l>
       <l n="76">And what Love held , awake , he holds , asleep .</l>
