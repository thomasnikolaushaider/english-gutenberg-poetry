       <l n="13">A sound of dice — an oath — a crashing chair ...</l>

       <l n="1">This grave , unlabouring beauty of the dusk ,</l>
       <l n="2">Stars and still fields and swallows in the sky ,</l>
       <l n="3">These cool , damp odours faint with earthen musk ,</l>
       <l n="4">The fading sheep like ghosts of sheep gone by ,—</l>

       <l n="6">That something like a mood has gathered there ,</l>
       <l n="7">Piled deep and high , again and yet again ,</l>
       <l n="8">A moving , thoughtful presence on the air .</l>

       <l n="9">So when the last light passes from the hill ,</l>

       <l n="11">And the last bell has sounded and grown still ,—</l>
       <l n="12">These blinking stars awake and tremble through ,</l>
       <l n="13">Re-blossomed from those gathering moods of time ,</l>
       <l n="14">Like brooding thoughts that flower into rhyme .</l>

       <l n="1">I have not known a quieter thing than ships ,</l>

       <l n="5">Nothing disturbs them now , no stormy grips</l>
