    <p>TO THE MEMORY OF SIR CECIL SPRING-RICE I . Steadfast as any soldier of the line He served his England , with the imminent death Poised at his heart . Nor could the world divine The constant peril of each burdened breath . England , and the honour of England , he still served Walking the strict path , with the old high pride Of those invincible knights who never swerved One hair 's breadth from the way until they died . Quietness he loved , and books , and the grave beauty Of England 's Helicon , whose eternal light Shines like a lantern on that road of duty , Discerned by few in this chaotic night . And his own pen , foretelling his release , Told us that he foreknew “ the end was peace . ” II . Soldier of England , he shall live unsleeping Among his friends , with the old proud flag above ; For even today her honour is in his keeping . He has joined the hosts that guard her with their love . They shine like stars , unnumbered happy legions , In that high realm where all our darkness dies . He moves , with honour , in those loftier regions , Above this “ world of passion and of lies ": For so he called it , keeping his own pure passion A silent flame before the true and good ; Not fawning on the throng in this world 's fashion To come and see what all might see who would . Soldier of England , brave and gentle knight , The soul of Sidney welcomes you tonight .</p>

       <l n="6">So it descended , at night , on the city .</l>
       <l n="7">So it went lavishing beauty and pity ,</l>
       <l n="8">Lighting the lordliest street of the world</l>
       <l n="9">With half of the banners that earth has unfurled ;</l>
       <l n="10">Over the lamps that are brighter than stars .</l>

       <l n="14">Leaping to battle as man to his mate ,</l>
       <l n="15">Joyous as God when he moved to create ,—</l>

       <l n="19">Tower to the height of a brighter dominion ,</l>

       <l n="50">That is America , speaking one tongue ,</l>
       <l n="51">Acting her epics before they are sung ,</l>

     <note>After reading an article in a leading London journal by an “ intellectual ” who attacked one of the noblest poets and greatest artists of a former century ( or any century ) on the ground that his high ethical standards were incompatible with the new lawlessness . This vicious lawlessness the writer described definitely , and he paid his tribute to dishonour as openly and brutally as any of the Bolsheviki could have done . I had always known that this was the real ground of the latter-day onslaught on some of the noblest literature of the past ; but I had never seen it openly confessed before . The time has now surely come when , if our civilization is to make any fight at all against the new “ red ruin and breaking up of laws , ” we must cease to belaud our slack-minded , latter-day “ literature of rebellion ” for its cleverness in making scraps of paper out of the plain laws of right and wrong . It has been doing this for more than twenty-five years , and the same has become fashionable among those who are too busy to read carefully or understand fully what pitfalls are being prepared for their own feet and the feet of their children .</note>

       <l n="4">The sunset lingered in the pale green West :</l>

       <l n="1">Under an arch of glorious leaves I passed</l>
       <l n="2">Out of the wood and saw the sickle moon</l>
       <l n="3">Floating in daylight o'er the pale green sea .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="4">It was the quiet hour before the sun</l>
       <l n="5">Gathers the clouds to prayer and silently</l>
       <l n="6">Utters his benediction on the waves</l>
       <l n="7">That whisper round the death-bed of the day .</l>
       <l n="8">The labourers were returning from the farms</l>
       <l n="9">And children danced to meet them . From the doors</l>
       <l n="10">Of cottages there came a pleasant clink</l>
       <l n="11">Where busy hands laid out the evening meal .</l>
       <l n="12">From smouldering elms around the village spire</l>
       <l n="13">There soared and sank the caw of gathering rooks .</l>
       <l n="14">The faint-flushed clouds were listening to the tale</l>
       <l n="15">The sea tells to the sunset with one sigh .</l>
       <l n="16">The last white wistful sea-bird sought for peace ,</l>
       <l n="17">And the last fishing-boat stole o'er the bar ,</l>
       <l n="18">And fragrant grasses , murmuring a prayer ,</l>
       <l n="19">Bowed all together to the holy west ,</l>
       <l n="20">Bowed all together thro ’ the golden hush ,</l>
       <l n="21">The breathing hush , the solemn scented hush ,</l>
       <l n="22">The holy , holy hush of eventide .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="23">And , in among the ferns that crowned the hill</l>
       <l n="24">With waving green and whispers of the wind ,</l>
       <l n="25">A boy and girl , carelessly linking hands ,</l>
       <l n="26">Into their golden dream drifted away .</l>
       <l n="27">On that rich afternoon of scent and song</l>
       <l n="28">Old Michael Oaktree died . It was not much</l>
       <l n="29">He wished for ; but indeed I think he longed</l>
       <l n="30">To see the light of summer once again</l>
       <l n="31">Blossoming o'er the far blue hills . I know</l>
       <l n="32">He used to like his rough-hewn wooden bench</l>
       <l n="33">Placed in the sun outside the cottage door</l>
       <l n="34">Where in the listening stillness he could hear ,</l>
       <l n="35">Across the waving gilly-flowers that crowned</l>
       <l n="36">His crumbling garden wall , the long low sigh</l>
       <l n="37">Of supreme peace that whispers to the hills</l>
       <l n="38">The sacred consolation of the sea .</l>
       <l n="39">He did not hope for much : he longed to live</l>
       <l n="40">Until the winter came again , he said ;</l>
       <l n="41">But on the last sweet eve of May he died .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="42">I wandered sadly through the dreaming lanes</l>
       <l n="43">Down to the cottage on that afternoon ;</l>
       <l n="44">For I had known old Michael Oaktree now</l>
       <l n="45">So many years , so many happy years .</l>
       <l n="46">When I was little he had carried me</l>
       <l n="47">High on his back to see the harvest home ,</l>
       <l n="48">And given me many a ride upon his wagon</l>
       <l n="49">Among the dusty scents of sun and hay .</l>
       <l n="50">He showed me how to snare the bulky trout</l>
       <l n="51">That lurked under the bank of yonder brook .</l>
       <l n="52">Indeed , he taught me many a country craft ,</l>
       <l n="53">For I was apt to learn , and , as I learnt ,</l>
       <l n="54">I loved the teacher of that homely lore .</l>
       <l n="55">Deep in my boyish heart he shared the glad</l>
       <l n="56">Influence of the suns and winds and waves ,</l>
       <l n="57">Giving my childhood what it hungered for —</l>
       <l n="58">The rude earth-wisdom of the primal man .</l>

       <l n="59">He had retained his childhood : Death for him</l>

       <l n="62">Of their companionship and mutual aid .</l>
       <l n="63">We , toilers after truth , are weaned too soon</l>
       <l n="64">From earth 's dark arms and naked barbarous breast .</l>
       <l n="65">Too soon , too soon , we leave the golden feast ,</l>
       <l n="66">Fetter the dancing limbs and pluck the crown</l>
       <l n="67">Of roses from the dreaming brow . We pass</l>
       <l n="68">Our lives in most laborious idleness .</l>
       <l n="69">For we have lost the meaning of the world ;</l>
       <l n="70">We have gone out into the night too soon ;</l>
       <l n="71">We have mistaken all the means of grace</l>
       <l n="72">And over-rated our small power to learn .</l>
       <l n="73">And the years move so swiftly over us :</l>
       <l n="74">We have so little time to live in worlds</l>
       <l n="75">Unrealised and unknown realms of joy ,</l>
       <l n="76">We are so old before we learn how vain</l>
       <l n="77">Our effort was , how fruitlessly we cast</l>
       <l n="78">Our Bread upon the waters , and how weak</l>
       <l n="79">Our hearts were , but our chance desires how strong !</l>
       <l n="80">Then , in the dark , our sense of light decays ;</l>
       <l n="81">We cannot cry to God as once we cried !</l>
       <l n="82">Lost in the gloom , our faith , perhaps our love ,</l>
       <l n="83">Lies dead with years that never can return .</l>

       <l n="89">The wind , the silence and the heart of peace ;</l>

       <l n="97">The soul of man attains infinity ,</l>

       <l n="105">Through simple love and simple faith , this man</l>
