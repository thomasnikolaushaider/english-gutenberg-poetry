      <l n="1">The Long View</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Some day of days ! Some dawning yet to be I shall be clothed with immortality !</p>
   <p>And , in that day , I shall not greatly care That Jane spilt candle grease upon the stair .</p>
   <p>It will not grieve me then , as once it did , That careless hands have chipped my teapot lid .</p>
   <p>I groan , being burdened . But , in that glad day , I shall forget vexations of the way .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">That needs were often great , when means</l>
     <l n="2">were small ,</l>
     <l n="3">Will not perplex me any more at all</l>
     <l n="4">A few short years at most ( it may be less ) ,</l>
     <l n="5">I shall have done with earthly storm and</l>
     <l n="6">stress .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>So , for this day , I lay me at Thy feet . O , keep me sweet , my Master ! Keep me sweet !</p>
   <p>Within my House</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">First , there 's the entrance , narrow ,</l>
     <l n="2">and so small ,</l>
     <l n="3">The hat-stand seems to fill the tiny hall ;</l>
     <l n="4">That staircase , too , has such an awkward</l>
     <l n="5">bend ,</l>
     <l n="6">The carpet rucks , and rises up on end !</l>
     <l n="7">Then , all the rooms are cramped and close</l>
     <l n="8">together ;</l>
     <l n="9">And there 's a musty smell in rainy weather .</l>
     <l n="10">Yes , and it makes the daily work go hard</l>
     <l n="11">To have the only tap across a yard .</l>
     <l n="12">These creaking doors , these draughts , this</l>
     <l n="13">battered paint ,</l>
     <l n="14">Would try , I think , the temper of a saint ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="15">How often had I railed against these</l>
     <l n="16">things ,</l>
     <l n="17">With envies , and with bitter murmurings</l>
     <l n="18">For spacious rooms , and sunny garden</l>
     <l n="19">plots !</l>
     <l n="20">Until one day ,</l>
     <l n="21">Washing the breakfast dishes , so I think ,</l>
     <l n="22">I paused a moment in my work to pray ;</l>
     <l n="23">And then and there</l>
     <l n="24">All life seemed suddenly made new and</l>
     <l n="25">fair ;</l>
     <l n="26">For , like the Psalmist 's dove among the</l>
     <l n="27">pots</l>
     <l n="28">( Those endless pots , that filled the tiny</l>
     <l n="29">sink ! ) ,</l>
     <l n="30">My spirit found her wings .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="31">“ Lord ” ( thus I prayed ) , “ it matters not</l>

     <l n="33">That my poor home is ill-arranged and</l>
     <l n="34">small :</l>
     <l n="35">I , not the house , am straitened ; Lord ,</l>
     <l n="36">‘ tis I !</l>
     <l n="37">Enlarge my foolish heart , that by-and-by</l>
     <l n="38">I may look up with such a radiant face</l>
     <l n="39">Thou shalt have glory even in this place .</l>
     <l n="40">And when I trip , or stumble unawares</l>
     <l n="41">In carrying water up these awkward stairs ,</l>
     <l n="42">Then keep me sweet , and teach me day</l>
     <l n="43">by day</l>
     <l n="44">To tread with patience Thy appointed</l>
     <l n="45">way .</l>
     <l n="46">As for the house . . . . Lord , let it be</l>
     <l n="47">my part</l>

   <p>Homesick</p>
   <p>I shut my eyes to rest ‘ em , just a bit ago it seems , An ’ back among the Cotswolds I were wanderin ’ in me dreams . I saw the old grey homestead , with the rickyard set around , An ’ catched the lowin ’ of the herd , a pleasant , homelike sound . Then on I went a-singin ’ , through the pastures where the sheep Was lyin ’ underneath the elms , a-tryin ’ for to sleep .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">An ’ where the stream was tricklin ’ by , half</l>
     <l n="2">stifled by the grass ,</l>
     <l n="3">Heaped over thick with buttercups , I saw</l>
     <l n="4">the corncrake pass .</l>
     <l n="5">For ‘ twas Summer , Summer , SUMMER !</l>
     <l n="6">An ’ the blue forget-me-nots</l>
     <l n="7">Wiped out this dusty city and the smoky</l>
     <l n="8">chimbley pots .</l>
     <l n="9">I clean forgot My Lady 's gown , the</l>
     <l n="10">dazzlin ’ sights I 've seen ;</l>
     <l n="11">I was back among the Cotswolds , where</l>
     <l n="12">me heart has always been .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Then through the sixteen-acre on I went , a stiffish climb , Right to the bridge , where all our sheep comes up at shearin ’ time . There was the wild briar roses hangin ’ down so pink an ’ sweet , A-droppin ’ o ’ their fragrance on the clover at my feet An ’ here me heart stopped beatin ’ , for down by Gatcombe 's Wood My lad was workin ’ with his team , as only my lad could !</p>
   <p>“ COME BACK ! ” was what the tricklin ’ brook an ’ breezes seemed to say . “ ‘ TIS LONESOME ON THE COTSWOLDS NOW THAT MARY DREW 'S AWAY . ”</p>
   <p>An ’ back again I 'm goin ’ ( for me wages has been paid , An ’ they 're lookin ’ through the papers for another kitchen maid ) . Back to the old grey homestead , an ’ the uplands cool an ’ green , To my lad among the Cotswolds , where me heart has always been !</p>
