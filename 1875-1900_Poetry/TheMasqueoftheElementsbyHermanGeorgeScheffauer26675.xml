     <head>ARGUMENT</head>
     <p>In this Threnody and Birth-song of the Elements , written in California some five years ago , I have striven to capture and present some of the chief-factors and phases of the eternal drama of Life and Death in the Universe . These powers , elements and agents I have endowed with human attributes and human emotions as though it were Man himself who uttered himself through them .</p>
     <p>The actors in this cosmic masque or pageant of the planets are the Sun , the Moon and the Earth with her four Elements ; for stage there is the limitless background of Time and Space , and the audience may be conceived as being represented by Immanent Nature . Creation and Dissolution are her ministers , twin forces of that divine everlasting Energy which brings to pass the cycles of the Eternal Recurrence .</p>
     <p>The action takes its course with a certain regard for the laws and revelations of Science , but this compliance is only such as poetry need observe . Despite the inherent and mystic majesty of Matter ,— too commonly reviled !— fantasy must have leave , in such a work , to force its way past the barrier of facts or to reshape them to its needs .</p>
     <p>Whether the action begin with the impulse of Dissolution or with that of Creation does not in any way affect the essentials of the plan . The alternations of Life and Death , of Cosmic Night and Day , must inevitably follow and destroy each other , like the serpents in the ancient symbol . Yet I thought it desirable to end this work with the larger and salient note of hope and joy that rings out of the Birth that is Re-birth rather than with the Passing which is but a recurrent preparation for that Birth .</p>

      <head>THE PASSING</head>
       <l n="1">The song of the Spirit of Chaos is heard on high above the aged</l>
       <l n="2">Solar Universe .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>The Sun hangs in the black wastes below . His dazzling beams are shorn away . He glows , but dimly , like an ember , with a red and smouldering heat .</p>
     <p>In their concentric rounds lie poised the planets , like weary-winged cup-bearers , circling about their sleepless lord .</p>
     <p>His fire , dull with death , wavers across their dim faces , even unto dusky Uranus and lowering Neptune in the cold , outermost rings .</p>
     <p>In the dark , all-surrounding void new constellations gleam on the thrones of the heavens . The old are changed , deposed or dead .</p>
     <p>Their figures , unfixed in the abyss , have been shifted like errant sands of Earth .</p>
     <p>The spirit of Chaos , from her uncharted tracts , summons her ministrant powers of Death and Change . She beholds them blight the worlds . Her presence enfolds destroyers and destroyed as with a cloak .</p>
     <p>The dusks and damps of dissolution spread out their lethal and invisible wings .</p>
     <p>The voice of the Spirit , like spheral music , flows out of the darkness .</p>
     <p>The orbs listen and are filled with a miraculous consciousness and the soft lassitude of Death .</p>

       <l n="23">His vassal globes roll on , disturbed and bleak .</l>

     <p>The Lord of Day shakes upon his central seat and turns up his hectic front in dumb questionings of despair . He yearns for sleep to seal his kingly eye .</p>
     <p>The calcined wounds upon him are like many mouths . They roll forth trembling thunder .</p>
     <p>And now is heard the voice of the Sun in agony :</p>

     <p>A song fours down from the skies , a plangent song of triumph from the Moon . Yet it is not her voice , but that of the Moon Wraith . She reigns in mockery and malice upon her peaks in gulfs of solitude .</p>
     <p>She sings for her who perished long ago . Her voice is flung exulting over the ruins .</p>
     <p>The Phantasm turns the ashen sphere about the rusted poles .</p>
     <p>The mystery of the Moons invisible hemisphere is now revealed .</p>
     <p>It too is desolation .</p>

     <p>His great green front and land-fettered limbs glimmer up to his mistress Moon . His breast heaves unto her as of old with an awful and passionate longing .</p>
     <p>But a film has veiled his eyes , and now stagnation builds up her muddy pillars in his heart . There Death reigns amidst havoc .</p>
     <p>His leviathans and huge worms and wrecks of ships rot on every shore and in his dunnest deeps amidst pearls and sea-born blooms .</p>
     <p>The innumerable myrmidons of his empire , fretted masses , chained by weeds , oppress the old Equator .</p>
     <p>The coasts he laved and swept are marred with deadly froth . They are now but ruins of the vast poison-chalice of the sea , all fringed with bloody spume .</p>
     <p>This is his final anguish and these his final groans .</p>
     <p>It is the last song of the sorrowing Sea !</p>
     <p>Hoarsely reverberates his threnody ; he piles up higher and higher his tremendous tomb of sound , beneath which he shall compose himself in tideless calms of sleep .</p>

     <p>The dead worlds are hidden in the lap of Night , sightless , forlorn wanderers . They move in darkness , unseeing and unseen , though smitten by the rays of living stars .</p>
     <p>Upon their cold breasts of stone the dust of ruined worlds lies as a garment . Windless it lies as it falls or rises out of Chaos that encompasses all .</p>
     <p>The Spirit of Creation moves grandly through the deeps . In her hands she bears Fire and Light , on her lips her all-conquering command . She flings dead worlds among the dead , as a sower his seed or a slinger his stones .</p>
     <p>A spark is lit in the vast obscure . A glory , a rose of fire , blooms in the pit of darkness . It is now a glowing mist with far-spread vans , a phoenix wrought of flame .</p>
     <p>The cloud gathers about it its flowing veils and swarming foam of Fire . It winds them around its white effulgent heart . The sundered flakes of crimson twist and turn , they shrink , yet do not flee .</p>
     <p>Out of the blazing mists a new-born Sun shapes forth his awful splendour . His worlds divest themselves of robes and wings , shining in beauty white and pure .</p>
     <p>The dead are born again and the stars rejoice in light .</p>
     <p>From the molten orbs there comes a murmur , a fresh music to mingle with the Sun 's .</p>
     <p>The words of the Spirit of Creation swell in a harmonious storm , they mould the worlds as with hands , they sweep the plumbless spaces as with a besom of winds .</p>

     <p>The flagrant arrows of the Sun shower on his glancing mail . The estray Winds are wanton with his locks . His mutinous waves whisper each to each , and leap and sink .</p>
     <p>Desire irresistible roves within his heaving deeps . Life wields a goad in every drop .</p>
     <p>He decks his floods for the face of the Moon , and enlaces them with chains of shackled pearls and bands of foam .</p>
     <p>He sends his salty breath aloft and wreathes the Sun with clouds . But his mists return again , falling as tears upon his face .</p>
     <p>Inert in the profounds the blind bathybus lies . Fecundity flings her seeds and spores into the glazed abysses , and they teem . There is a heaving in the broken , sunless bottoms ; the continents and islands are upcast , rugged and black , shaking the roaring Seas from their flanks .</p>
     <p>The labour and song of the Sea begin ; the billows repeat it to the lips of the infant land .</p>

      <head>SONG OF EARTH THE ELEMENT</head>
      <head>Earth , the Element , mute , impassive , primal , lies shaped to valley , plain and peak . Enwombed in her , the ancient vast fertility lives on .</head>
      <head>Her veins are charged with promise and birth , exhaustless quickenings of her eager flesh . She drinks from rocky bowls where lakes lie spread , from twining rivers and living streams .</head>

     <p>Chaos and Night and Death are disenthroned . The system burns along its orbits through the dark . The benisons of the stars and suns are cast upon these youngest worlds .</p>
     <p>Buoyant and blithe the planets wheel .</p>
     <p>Their year-long arcs and each season 's ordained processional are portioned unto them : their vassal moons also and the speed of their turning and their measure of night and day .</p>
     <p>The ruddy jocund Earth presses close to the Sun , timorous of the outer void , baring her bosom to his kiss .</p>
     <p>Has not the inevitable and recurrent Spring of Existence come unto her once again ? The iron shackles of Silence — are they not broken ?— the granite of the Night , is it not crumbled low ?— the ice of Death , is it not molten ?</p>
     <p>She blooms in her resurrection ; her voice is lifted in the universal litany to Life . She rolls in her golden garniture of beams , circling with the singing sister-spheres . Her rondure floats against the distant cohorts of the constellations .</p>
     <p>The ancient Spirit of Chaos swings her pitchy cressets , and sinks down the starless deep on her tall catafalque of Death .</p>
     <p>Rejoice , O orb vestured in beauty ! Put forth thy wings , thy coronals of Love , wrap thee with fluctuant Winds and exulting Seas !</p>
     <p>Shall thy offspring feel dismay , knowing what light shall burst from dark , what life leap from Death , what flowers blow from dust ?</p>
     <p>So the anointed and belted spheres , re-risen from their bath of silence and their sleep of time , move on companioned with eternal hope .</p>
     <p>The fingers of the Sun stroke forth a glorious strain ; the worlds are shawns and cymbals for his minstrelsy . The Spirit of Creation pours forth her victorious baptismal harmonies .</p>
     <p>Triumphantly her music daunts the firmament and echoes against the dusks of the Unapproachable .</p>
