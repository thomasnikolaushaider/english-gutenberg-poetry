       <l n="2">I do not think that skies and meadows are</l>

       <l n="4">Comes of a quiet spirit , or that trees</l>
       <l n="5">Have wisdom in their windless silences .</l>
       <l n="6">Yet these are things invested in my mood</l>
       <l n="7">With constancy , and peace , and fortitude ,</l>
       <l n="8">That in my troubled season I can cry</l>
       <l n="9">Upon the wide composure of the sky ,</l>
       <l n="10">And envy fields , and wish that I might be</l>

       <l n="1">Those hours are best when suddenly</l>
       <l n="2">The voices of the world are still ,</l>
       <l n="3">And in that quiet place is heard</l>
       <l n="4">The voice of one small singing bird ,</l>
       <l n="5">Alone within his quiet tree ;</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="6">When to one field that crowns a hill ,</l>

       <l n="9">Give all their riches , lake and plain ,</l>
       <l n="10">Cornland and fell and pillared wood ;</l>
       <l n="11">When in a hill-top acre , bare</l>
       <l n="12">For the seed ’ s use , I am aware</l>
       <l n="13">Of all the beauty that an age</l>

       <l n="18">The passions of experience</l>

       <l n="25">When one man speaks for Every One ,</l>
       <l n="26">When Music lives in one small bird ,</l>
       <l n="27">When in a furrowed hill we see</l>
       <l n="28">All beauty in epitome —</l>
       <l n="29">Those hours are best ; for those belong</l>

       <l n="1">Think not that mystery has place</l>

       <l n="3">Or when the midnight watches are</l>
       <l n="4">Uncompanied of moon or star ,</l>

       <l n="6">Enfolded from the loving eye</l>
       <l n="7">By fogs rebellious to the sun ,</l>

       <l n="22">Into one vision harvested ,</l>

       <l n="24">In silver cold lucidity ;</l>
       <l n="25">Those countenances search that bear</l>
       <l n="26">Witness to very character ,</l>
       <l n="27">And listen to the song that weighs</l>
       <l n="28">A life ’ s adventure in a phrase —</l>
       <l n="29">These are the founts of wonder , these</l>
       <l n="30">The plainer miracles to please</l>

       <l n="5">Until his burning lips of gold</l>

      <head>THE CARVER IN STONE</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">He was a man with wide and patient eyes ,</l>
       <l n="2">Grey , like the drift of twitch-fires blown in June</l>
       <l n="3">That , without fearing , searched if any wrong</l>
       <l n="4">Might threaten from your heart . Grey eyes he had</l>
       <l n="5">Under a brow was drawn because he knew</l>
       <l n="6">So many seasons to so many pass</l>
       <l n="7">Of upright service , loyal , unabased</l>
       <l n="8">Before the world seducing , and so , barren</l>
       <l n="9">Of good words praising and thought that mated his .</l>
       <l n="10">He carved in stone . Out of his quiet life</l>
       <l n="11">He watched as any faithful seaman charged</l>
       <l n="12">With tidings of the myriad faring sea ,</l>
       <l n="13">And thoughts and premonitions through his mind</l>
       <l n="14">Sailing as ships from strange and storied lands</l>
       <l n="15">His hungry spirit held , till all they were</l>
       <l n="16">Found living witness in the chiselled stone .</l>
       <l n="17">Slowly out of the dark confusion , spread</l>
       <l n="18">By life ’ s innumerable venturings</l>
       <l n="19">Over his brain , he would triumph into the light</l>
       <l n="20">Of one clear mood , unblemished of the blind</l>
       <l n="21">Legions of errant thought that cried about</l>
       <l n="22">His rapt seclusion : as a pearl unsoiled ,</l>
       <l n="23">Nay , rather washed to lonelier chastity ,</l>
       <l n="24">In gritty mud . And then would come a bird ,</l>
       <l n="25">A flower , or the wind moving upon a flower ,</l>
       <l n="26">A beast at pasture , or a clustered fruit ,</l>
       <l n="27">A peasant face as were the saints of old ,</l>
       <l n="28">The leer of custom , or the bow of the moon</l>
       <l n="29">Swung in miraculous poise — some stray from the world</l>
       <l n="30">Of things created by the eternal mind</l>
       <l n="31">In joy articulate . And his perfect mood</l>
       <l n="32">Would dwell about the token of God ’ s mood ,</l>
       <l n="33">Until in bird or flower or moving wind</l>
       <l n="34">Or flock or shepherd or the troops of heaven</l>
       <l n="35">It sprang in one fierce moment of desire</l>
       <l n="36">To visible form .</l>
       <l n="37">Then would his chisel work among the stone ,</l>
       <l n="38">Persuading it of petal or of limb</l>
       <l n="39">Or starry curve , till risen anew there sang</l>
       <l n="40">Shape out of chaos , and again the vision</l>
       <l n="41">Of one mind single from the world was pressed</l>
       <l n="42">Upon the daily custom of the sky</l>
       <l n="43">Or field or the body of man .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="44">His people</l>
       <l n="45">Had many gods for worship . The tiger-god ,</l>
       <l n="46">The owl , the dewlapped bull , the running pard ,</l>
       <l n="47">The camel and the lizard of the slime ,</l>
       <l n="48">The ram with quivering fleece and fluted horn ,</l>
       <l n="49">The crested eagle and the doming bat</l>
       <l n="50">Were sacred . And the king and his high priests</l>
       <l n="51">Decreed a temple , wide on columns huge ,</l>
       <l n="52">Should top the cornlands to the sky ’ s far line .</l>
       <l n="53">They bade the carvers carve along the walls</l>
       <l n="54">Images of their gods , each one to carve</l>
       <l n="55">As he desired , his choice to name his god ....</l>
       <l n="56">And many came ; and he among them , glad</l>
       <l n="57">Of three leagues ’ travel through the singing air</l>
       <l n="58">Of dawn among the boughs yet bare of green ,</l>
       <l n="59">The eager flight of the spring leading his blood</l>
       <l n="60">Into swift lofty channels of the air ,</l>
       <l n="61">Proud as an eagle riding to the sun ....</l>
       <l n="62">An eagle , clean of pinion — there ’ s his choice .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="63">Daylong they worked under the growing roof ,</l>
       <l n="64">One at his leopard , one the staring ram ,</l>
       <l n="65">And he winning his eagle from the stone ,</l>
       <l n="66">Until each man had carved one image out ,</l>
       <l n="67">Arow beyond the portal of the house .</l>
       <l n="68">They stood arow , the company of gods ,</l>
       <l n="69">Camel and bat , lizard and bull and ram ,</l>
       <l n="70">The pard and owl , dead figures on the wall ,</l>
       <l n="71">Figures of habit driven on the stone</l>
       <l n="72">By chisels governed by no heat of the brain</l>
       <l n="73">But drudges of hands that moved by easy rule .</l>
       <l n="74">Proudly recorded mood was none , no thought</l>
       <l n="75">Plucked from the dark battalions of the mind</l>
       <l n="76">And throned in everlasting sight . But one</l>
       <l n="77">God of them all was witness of belief</l>
       <l n="78">And large adventure dared . His eagle spread</l>
       <l n="79">Wide pinions on a cloudless ground of heaven ,</l>
       <l n="80">Glad with the heart ’ s high courage of that dawn</l>
       <l n="81">Moving upon the ploughlands newly sown ,</l>
       <l n="82">Dead stone the rest . He looked , and knew it so .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="83">Then came the king with priests and counsellors</l>
       <l n="84">And many chosen of the people , wise</l>
       <l n="85">With words weary of custom , and eyes askew</l>
       <l n="86">That watched their neighbour face for any news</l>
       <l n="87">Of the best way of judgment , till , each sure</l>
       <l n="88">None would determine with authority ,</l>
       <l n="89">All spoke in prudent praise . One liked the owl</l>
       <l n="90">Because an owl blinked on the beam of his barn .</l>
       <l n="91">One , hoarse with crying gospels in the street ,</l>
       <l n="92">Praised most the ram , because the common folk</l>
       <l n="93">Wore breeches made of ram ’ s wool . One declared</l>
       <l n="94">The tiger pleased him best ,— the man who carved</l>
       <l n="95">The tiger-god was halt out of the womb —</l>
       <l n="96">A man to praise , being so pitiful .</l>
       <l n="97">And one , whose eyes dwelt in a distant void ,</l>
       <l n="98">With spell and omen pat upon his lips ,</l>
       <l n="99">And a purse for any crystal prophet ripe ,</l>
       <l n="100">A zealot of the mist , gazed at the bull —</l>
       <l n="101">A lean ill-shapen bull of meagre lines</l>
       <l n="102">That scarce the steel had graved upon the stone —</l>
       <l n="103">Saying that here was very mystery</l>
       <l n="104">And truth , did men but know . And one there was</l>
       <l n="105">Who praised his eagle , but remembering</l>
       <l n="106">The lither pinion of the swift , the curve</l>
       <l n="107">That liked him better of the mirrored swan .</l>
       <l n="108">And they who carved the tiger-god and ram ,</l>
       <l n="109">The camel and the pard , the owl and bull ,</l>
       <l n="110">And lizard , listened greedily , and made</l>
       <l n="111">Humble denial of their worthiness ,</l>
       <l n="112">And when the king his royal judgment gave</l>
       <l n="113">That all had fashioned well , and bade that each</l>
       <l n="114">Re-shape his chosen god along the walls</l>
       <l n="115">Till all the temple boasted of their skill ,</l>
       <l n="116">They bowed themselves in token that as this</l>
       <l n="117">Never had carvers been so fortunate .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="118">Only the man with wide and patient eyes</l>
       <l n="119">Made no denial , neither bowed his head .</l>
       <l n="120">Already while they spoke his thought had gone</l>
       <l n="121">Far from his eagle , leaving it for a sign</l>
       <l n="122">Loyally wrought of one deep breath of life ,</l>
       <l n="123">And played about the image of a toad</l>
       <l n="124">That crawled among his ivy leaves . A queer</l>
       <l n="125">Puff-bellied toad , with eyes that always stared</l>
       <l n="126">Sidelong at heaven and saw no heaven there ,</l>
       <l n="127">Weak-hammed , and with a throttle somehow twisted</l>
       <l n="128">Beyond full wholesome draughts of air , and skin</l>
       <l n="129">Of wrinkled lips , the only zest or will</l>
       <l n="130">The little flashing tongue searching the leaves .</l>
       <l n="131">And king and priest , chosen and counsellor ,</l>
       <l n="132">Babbling out of their thin and jealous brains ,</l>
       <l n="133">Seemed strangely one ; a queer enormous toad</l>
       <l n="134">Panting under giant leaves of dark ,</l>
       <l n="135">Sunk in the loins , peering into the day .</l>
       <l n="136">Their judgment wry he counted not for wrong</l>
       <l n="137">More than the fabled poison of the toad</l>
       <l n="138">Striking at simple wits ; how should their thought</l>
       <l n="139">Or word in praise or blame come near the peace</l>
       <l n="140">That shone in seasonable hours above</l>
       <l n="141">The patience of his spirit ’ s husbandry ?</l>
       <l n="142">They foolish and not seeing , how should he</l>
       <l n="143">Spend anger there or fear — great ceremonies</l>
       <l n="144">Equal for none save great antagonists ?</l>
       <l n="145">The grave indifference of his heart before them</l>
       <l n="146">Was moved by laughter innocent of hate ,</l>
       <l n="147">Chastising clean of spite , that moulded them</l>
       <l n="148">Into the antic likeness of his toad</l>
       <l n="149">Bidding for laughter underneath the leaves .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="150">He bowed not , nor disputed , but he saw</l>
       <l n="151">Those ill-created joyless gods , and loathed ,</l>
       <l n="152">And saw them creeping , creeping round the walls ,</l>
       <l n="153">Death breeding death , wile witnessing to wile ,</l>
       <l n="154">And sickened at the dull iniquity</l>
       <l n="155">Should be rewarded , and for ever breathe</l>
       <l n="156">Contagion on the folk gathered in prayer .</l>
       <l n="157">His truth should not be doomed to march among</l>
       <l n="158">This falsehood to the ages . He was called ,</l>
       <l n="159">And he must labour there ; if so the king</l>
       <l n="160">Would grant it , where the pillars bore the roof</l>
       <l n="161">A galleried way of meditation nursed</l>
       <l n="162">Secluded time , with wall of ready stone</l>

       <l n="164">The windows — there his chisel should be set ,—</l>
       <l n="165">It was his plea . And the king spoke of him ,</l>
       <l n="166">Scorning , as one lack-fettle , among all these</l>
       <l n="167">Eager to take the riches of renown ;</l>
       <l n="168">One fearful of the light or knowing nothing</l>
       <l n="169">Of light ’ s dimension , a witling who would throw</l>
       <l n="170">Honour aside and praise spoken aloud</l>
       <l n="171">All men of heart should covet . Let him go</l>
       <l n="172">Grubbing out of the sight of these who knew</l>
       <l n="173">The worth of substance ; there was his proper trade .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="174">A squat and curious toad indeed .... The eyes ,</l>

       <l n="178">Straightway about his gallery he moved ,</l>

       <l n="183">From floor to sill out of the stone was wooed</l>
       <l n="184">Memorial folly , as from the chisel leapt</l>

       <l n="188">Busily fixed upon the void .</l>
       <l n="189">All days</l>

       <l n="195">Lonely , as was his will , under the night</l>
       <l n="196">Of stars or cloud or summer ’ s folded sun ,</l>
       <l n="197">Through crop and wood and pastureland to sleep .</l>

       <l n="200">Unvisited his labour and forgot .</l>
       <l n="201">And times when he would lean out of his height</l>

       <l n="203">The row of carvers in their linen coats</l>
       <l n="204">Took in his vision a virtue that alone</l>
       <l n="205">Carving they had not nor the thing they carved .</l>
       <l n="206">Knowing the health that flowed about his close</l>

       <l n="216">So fashioned if it might be — and his eyes</l>

       <l n="243">Him homeward passing , bore on massy beam</l>
       <l n="244">The burden of the patient of the earth .</l>
       <l n="245">His camel bore the burden of the damned ,</l>
       <l n="246">Being gaunt , with eyes aslant along the nose .</l>
       <l n="247">He had a friend , who hammered bronze and iron</l>
       <l n="248">And cupped the moonstone on a silver ring ,</l>
       <l n="249">One constant like himself , would come at night</l>

       <l n="252">Together with unparsimonious mind</l>
       <l n="253">The crowded harbours of mortality .</l>
       <l n="254">And there were jests , wholesome as harvest ale</l>
       <l n="255">Of homely habit , bred of hearts that dared</l>
       <l n="256">Judgment of laughter under the eternal eye :</l>
       <l n="257">This frolic wisdom was his carven owl .</l>
       <l n="258">His ram was lordship on the lonely hills ,</l>
       <l n="259">Alert and fleet , content only to know</l>
       <l n="260">The wind mightily pouring on his fleece ,</l>
       <l n="261">With yesterday and all unrisen suns</l>
       <l n="262">Poorer than disinherited ghosts . His bat</l>
       <l n="263">Was ancient envy made a mockery ,</l>
       <l n="264">Cowering below the newer eagle carved</l>
       <l n="265">Above the arches with wide pinion spread ,</l>
       <l n="266">His faith ’ s dominion of that happy dawn .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="9">
       <l n="267">And so he wrought the gods upon the wall ,</l>
       <l n="268">Living and crying out of his desire ,</l>
       <l n="269">Out of his patient incorruptible thought ,</l>
       <l n="270">Wrought them in joy was wages to his faith .</l>
       <l n="271">And other than the gods he made . The stalks</l>
       <l n="272">Of bluebells heavy with the news of spring ,</l>
       <l n="273">The vine loaded with plenty of the year ,</l>
       <l n="274">And swallows , merely tenderness of thought</l>
       <l n="275">Bidding the stone to small and fragile flight ;</l>
       <l n="276">Leaves , the thin relics of autumnal boughs ,</l>
       <l n="277">Or massed in June ....</l>
       <l n="278">All from their native pressure bloomed and sprang</l>
       <l n="279">Under his shaping hand into a proud</l>
       <l n="280">And governed image of the central man ,—</l>
       <l n="281">Their moulding , charts of all his travelling .</l>
       <l n="282">And all were deftly ordered , duly set</l>
       <l n="283">Between the windows , underneath the sills ,</l>
       <l n="284">And roofward , as a motion rightly planned ,</l>
       <l n="285">Till on the wall , out of the sullen stone ,</l>
       <l n="286">A glory blazed , his vision manifest ,</l>
       <l n="287">His wonder captive . And he was content .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="10">
       <l n="288">And when the builders and the carvers knew</l>

       <l n="290">Over the cornlands , king and counsellor</l>
       <l n="291">And priest and chosen of the people came</l>

       <l n="295">Highest among the ranked artificers</l>
       <l n="296">The carvers stood . And when , the temple vowed</l>

       <l n="298">Given as was ordained , the king looked down</l>
       <l n="299">Upon the gathered folk , and bade them see</l>
       <l n="300">The comely gods fashioned about the walls ,</l>
       <l n="301">And keep in honour men whose precious skill</l>
       <l n="302">Could so adorn the sessions of their worship ,</l>
       <l n="303">Gravely the carvers bowed them to the ground .</l>
       <l n="304">Only the man with wide and patient eyes</l>
       <l n="305">Stood not among them ; nor did any come</l>
       <l n="306">To count his labour , where he watched alone</l>
       <l n="307">Above the coloured throng . He heard , and looked</l>
       <l n="308">Again upon his work , and knew it good ,</l>
       <l n="309">Smiled on his toad , passed down the stair unseen</l>
       <l n="310">And sang across the teeming meadows home .</l>

      <head>THE LIFE OF JOHN HERITAGE</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">Born in the Cotswolds in eighteen-forty or so ,</l>
       <l n="2">Bred on a hill-top that seemed the most of the world</l>
       <l n="3">Until he travelled the valleys , and found what a wonder</l>
       <l n="4">Of leagues from Gloucester lay to Stroud or Ciceter ,</l>
       <l n="5">John Heritage was a tiler . He split the stone ,</l>
       <l n="6">After the frosts , and learnt the laying of tiles ,</l>
       <l n="7">And was famous about the shire . And he was friendly</l>
       <l n="8">With Cotswold nature , hearing the hidden rooks</l>
       <l n="9">In Golden Vale , and the thin bleat of goats ,</l>
       <l n="10">And the rattling harness of Trilly ’ s teams at plough ,</l>
       <l n="11">And Richard Parker ’ s scythe for many years ,</l>
       <l n="12">As he went upon his tiling ; and the great landmarks ,</l>
       <l n="13">As loops of the Severn seen from Bisley Hill ,</l>
       <l n="14">Were his familiars , something of his religion .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="15">And he prospered , as men do . His little wage</l>
       <l n="16">Yet left a little over his wedded needs ,</l>
       <l n="17">And here a cottage he bought , and there another ,</l>
       <l n="18">About the Cotswolds , built of the royallest stone</l>
       <l n="19">That ’ s quarried in England , until he could think of age</l>
       <l n="20">With an easy mind ; and an acre of land was his</l>
       <l n="21">Where at hay-harvest he worked a little from tiling ,</l>
       <l n="22">Making his rick maturely or damning the wind</l>
       <l n="23">That scattered the swathes beyond his fork ’ s controlling .</l>
       <l n="24">And he trotted ajog to the town on market Thursdays ,</l>
       <l n="25">Driving a stout succession of good black geldings ,</l>
       <l n="26">That cropped his acre some twenty years apiece .</l>
       <l n="27">And he was an honest neighbour ; and so he grew old ,</l>
       <l n="28">And five strong sons , grizzled and middle-aged ,</l>
       <l n="29">Carried him down the hill , and on a stone</l>
       <l n="30">The mason cut —“ John Heritage , who died ,</l>

       <l n="32">And I know that some of us shatter our hearts on earth ,</l>
       <l n="33">With mightier aims than ever John Heritage knew ,</l>
       <l n="34">And think such things as never the tiler thought ,</l>
       <l n="35">Because of our pride and our eagerness of mind ...</l>
       <l n="36">But a life complete is a great nobility ,</l>
       <l n="37">And there ’ s a wisdom biding in Cotswold stone ,</l>
       <l n="38">While we in our furious intellectual travel</l>

      <head>TO ONE I LOVE</head>
       <l n="1">As I walked along the passage , in the night , beyond the stairs ,</l>
       <l n="2">In the dark ,</l>
       <l n="3">I was afraid ,</l>
       <l n="4">Suddenly ,</l>
       <l n="5">As will happen you know , my dear , it will often happen .</l>
       <l n="6">I knew the walls at my side ,</l>
       <l n="7">Knew the drawings hanging there , the order of their placing ,</l>
       <l n="8">And the door where my bed lay beyond ,</l>
       <l n="9">And the window on the landing —</l>
       <l n="10">There was even a little ray of moonlight through it —</l>
       <l n="11">All was known , familiar , my comfortable home ;</l>
       <l n="12">And yet I was afraid ,</l>
       <l n="13">Suddenly ,</l>
       <l n="14">In the dark , like a child , of nothing ,</l>
       <l n="15">Of vastness , of eternity , of the queer pains of thought ,</l>
       <l n="16">Such as used to trouble me when I heard ,</l>
       <l n="17">When I was little , the people talk</l>
       <l n="18">On Sundays of “ As it was in the Beginning ,</l>
       <l n="19">Is Now , and Ever Shall Be ....”</l>
       <l n="20">I am thirty-six years old ,</l>
       <l n="21">And folk are friendly to me ,</l>
       <l n="22">And there are no ghosts that should have reason to haunt me ,</l>
       <l n="23">And I have tempted no magical happenings</l>
       <l n="24">By forsaking the clear noons of thought</l>
       <l n="25">For the wizardries that the credulous take</l>
       <l n="26">To be golden roads to revelation .</l>
       <l n="27">I knew all was simplicity there ,</l>
       <l n="28">Without conspiracy , without antagonism ,</l>
       <l n="29">And yet I was afraid ,</l>
       <l n="30">Suddenly ,</l>
       <l n="31">A child , in the dark , forlorn ....</l>
       <l n="32">And then , as suddenly ,</l>
       <l n="33">I was aware of a profound , a miraculous understanding ,</l>
       <l n="34">Knowledge that comes to a man</l>
       <l n="35">But once or twice , as a bird ’ s note</l>
       <l n="36">In the still depth of the night</l>
       <l n="37">Striking upon the silence ...</l>
       <l n="38">I stood at the door , and there</l>
       <l n="39">Was mellow candle-light ,</l>
       <l n="40">And companionship , and comfort ,</l>
       <l n="41">And I knew</l>
       <l n="42">That it was even so ,</l>
       <l n="43">That it must be even so</l>
       <l n="44">With death .</l>
       <l n="45">I knew</l>
       <l n="46">That no harm could have touched me out of my fear ,</l>
       <l n="47">Because I had no grudge against anything ,</l>
       <l n="48">Because I had desired</l>
       <l n="49">In the darkness , when fear came ,</l>
       <l n="50">Love only , and pity , and fellowship ,</l>
       <l n="51">And it would have been a thing monstrous ,</l>
       <l n="52">Something defying nature</l>
       <l n="53">And all the simple universal fitness</l>
       <l n="54">For any force there to have come evilly</l>
       <l n="55">Upon me , who had no evil in my heart ,</l>
       <l n="56">But only trust , and tenderness</l>
       <l n="57">For every presence about me in the air ,</l>
       <l n="58">For the very shadow about me ,</l>
       <l n="59">Being a little child for no one ’ s envy .</l>
       <l n="60">And I knew that God</l>
       <l n="61">Must understand that we go</l>
       <l n="62">To death as little children ,</l>
       <l n="63">Desiring love so simply , and love ’ s defence ,</l>
       <l n="64">And that he would be a barren God , without humour ,</l>
       <l n="65">To cheat so little , so wistful , a desire ,</l>
       <l n="66">That he created</l>
       <l n="67">In us , in our childishness ...</l>
       <l n="68">And I may never again be sure of this ,</l>
       <l n="69">But there , for a moment ,</l>
       <l n="70">In the candle-light ,</l>
       <l n="71">Standing at the door ,</l>
       <l n="72">I knew .</l>
