    <head>THE DANCING SEAL</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">When we were building Skua Light —</l>
     <l n="2">The first men who had lived a night</l>
     <l n="3">Upon that deep-sea Isle —</l>
     <l n="4">As soon as chisel touched the stone ,</l>
     <l n="5">The friendly seals would come ashore ;</l>
     <l n="6">And sit and watch us all the while ,</l>
     <l n="7">As though they 'd not seen men before ;</l>
     <l n="8">And so , poor beasts , had never known</l>
     <l n="9">Men had the heart to do them harm .</l>
     <l n="10">They 'd little cause to feel alarm</l>
     <l n="11">With us , for we were glad to find</l>
     <l n="12">Some friendliness in that strange sea ;</l>
     <l n="13">Only too pleased to let them be</l>
     <l n="14">And sit as long as they 'd a mind</l>
     <l n="15">To watch us : for their eyes were kind</l>
     <l n="16">Like women 's eyes , it seemed to me .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="17">So , hour on hour , they sat : I think</l>
     <l n="18">They liked to hear the chisels ’ clink :</l>
     <l n="19">And when the boy sang loud and clear ,</l>
     <l n="20">They scrambled closer in to hear ;</l>
     <l n="21">And if he whistled sweet and shrill ,</l>
     <l n="22">The queer beasts shuffled nearer still :</l>
     <l n="23">But every sleek and sheeny skin</l>
     <l n="24">Was mad to hear his violin .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="25">When , work all over for the day ,</l>
     <l n="26">He 'd take his fiddle down and play</l>
     <l n="27">His merry tunes beside the sea ,</l>
     <l n="28">Their eyes grew brighter and more bright ,</l>
     <l n="29">And burned and twinkled merrily :</l>
     <l n="30">And as I watched them one still night ,</l>
     <l n="31">And saw their eager sparkling eyes ,</l>
     <l n="32">I felt those lively seals would rise</l>
     <l n="33">Some shiny night ere he could know ,</l>
     <l n="34">And dance about him , heel and toe ,</l>
     <l n="35">Unto the fiddle 's heady tune .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="36">And at the rising of the moon ,</l>
     <l n="37">Half-daft , I took my stand before</l>
     <l n="38">A young seal lying on the shore ;</l>
     <l n="39">And called on her to dance with me .</l>
     <l n="40">And it seemed hardly strange when she</l>
     <l n="41">Stood up before me suddenly ,</l>
     <l n="42">And shed her black and sheeny skin ;</l>
     <l n="43">And smiled , all eager to begin ...</l>
     <l n="44">And I was dancing , heel and toe ,</l>
     <l n="45">With a young maiden white as snow ,</l>
     <l n="46">Unto a crazy violin .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="47">We danced beneath the dancing moon ,</l>
     <l n="48">All night , beside the dancing sea ,</l>
     <l n="49">With tripping toes and skipping heels :</l>
     <l n="50">And all about us friendly seals</l>
     <l n="51">Like Christian folk were dancing reels</l>
     <l n="52">Unto the fiddle 's endless tune</l>
     <l n="53">That kept on spinning merrily</l>
     <l n="54">As though it never meant to stop .</l>
     <l n="55">And never once the snow-white maid</l>
     <l n="56">A moment stayed</l>
     <l n="57">To take a breath ,</l>
     <l n="58">Though I was fit to drop :</l>
     <l n="59">And while those wild eyes challenged me ,</l>
     <l n="60">I knew as well as well could be</l>
     <l n="61">I must keep step with that young girl ,</l>
     <l n="62">Though we should dance to death .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="63">Then with a skirl</l>
     <l n="64">The fiddle broke :</l>
     <l n="65">The moon went out :</l>
     <l n="66">The sea stopped dead :</l>
     <l n="67">And , in a twinkling , all the rout</l>
     <l n="68">Of dancing folk had fled ...</l>
     <l n="69">And in the chill bleak dawn I woke</l>
     <l n="70">Upon the naked rock , alone .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="71">They 've brought me far from Skua Isle ...</l>
     <l n="72">I laugh to think they do not know</l>
     <l n="73">That as , all day , I chip the stone ,</l>
     <l n="74">Among my fellows here inland ,</l>
     <l n="75">I smell the sea-wrack on the shore ...</l>
     <l n="76">And see her snowy-tossing hand ,</l>
     <l n="77">And meet again her merry smile ...</l>
     <l n="78">And dream I 'm dancing all the while ,</l>
     <l n="79">I 'm dancing ever , heel and toe ,</l>
     <l n="80">With a seal-maiden , white as snow ,</l>
     <l n="81">On that moonshiny Island-strand ,</l>
     <l n="82">For ever and for evermore .</l>
    </lg>
    <p>THE SLAG</p>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="83">Among bleak hills of mounded slag they walked ,</l>
     <l n="84">‘ Neath sullen evening skies that seemed to sag</l>
     <l n="85">O'erhYpppHeNburdened by the belching smoke , and lie</l>
     <l n="86">Upon their aching foreheads , dense and dank ,</l>
     <l n="87">Till both felt youth within them fail and flag —</l>
     <l n="88">Even as the flame which shot a fiery rag</l>
     <l n="89">A fluttering moment through the murky sky</l>
     <l n="90">Above the black blast-furnaces , then sank</l>
     <l n="91">Again beneath the iron bell close-bound —</l>
     <l n="92">And it was all that they could do to drag</l>
     <l n="93">Themselves along , ‘ neath that dead-weight of smoke ,</l>
     <l n="94">Over the cinder-blasted , barren ground .</l>
     <l n="95">Though fitfully and fretfully she talked ,</l>
     <l n="96">He never turned his eyes to her , or spoke :</l>
     <l n="97">And as he slouched with her along the track</l>
     <l n="98">That skirted a stupendous , lowering mound ,</l>
     <l n="99">With listless eyes , and o'erhYpppHeNstrained sinews slack ,</l>
     <l n="100">She bit a petted , puckered lip , and frowned</l>
     <l n="101">To think she ever should be walking out</l>
     <l n="102">With this tongue-tied , slow-witted , hulking lout ,</l>
     <l n="103">As cold and dull and lifeless as the slag .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="104">And , all on edge , o'erwrought by the crampt day</l>
     <l n="105">Of crouched , close stitching at her dull machine ,</l>
     <l n="106">It seemed to her a girl of seventeen</l>
     <l n="107">Should have , at least , an hour of careless talking —</l>
     <l n="108">Should have , at least , an hour of life , out walking</l>
     <l n="109">Beside a lover , mettlesome and gay —</l>
     <l n="110">Not through her too short freedom doomed to lag</l>
     <l n="111">Beside a sparkless giant , glum and grim ,</l>
     <l n="112">Till all her eager youth should waste away .</l>
     <l n="113">Yet , even as she looked askance at him —</l>
     <l n="114">Well-knit , big-thewed , broad-chested , steady-eyed —</l>
     <l n="115">She dimly knew of depths she could not sound</l>
     <l n="116">In this strong lover , silent at her side :</l>
     <l n="117">And , once again , her heart was touched with pride</l>
     <l n="118">To think that he was hers , this strapping lad —</l>
     <l n="119">Black-haired , close-cropt , clean-skinned , and neatly clad ...</l>
     <l n="120">His crimson neckerchief , so smartly tied —</l>
     <l n="121">And hers alone , and more than all she had</l>
     <l n="122">In all the world to her ... and yet , so grave !</l>
     <l n="123">If he would only shew that he was glad</l>
     <l n="124">To be with her — a gleam , a spark of fire ,</l>
     <l n="125">A spurt of flame to shoot into the night ,</l>
     <l n="126">A moment through the murky heavens to wave</l>
     <l n="127">An eager beacon of enkindling light</l>
     <l n="128">In answer to her young heart 's quick desire !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="129">Yet , though he walked with dreaming eyes agaze ,</l>
     <l n="130">As , deep within a mound of slag , a core</l>
     <l n="131">Of unseen fire may smoulder many days ,</l>
     <l n="132">Till suddenly the whole heap glow ablaze ,</l>
     <l n="133">That seemed , but now , dead cinder , grey and cold ,</l>
     <l n="134">Life smouldered in his heart . The fire he fed</l>
     <l n="135">Day-long in the tall furnace just ahead</l>
     <l n="136">From that frail gallery slung against the sky</l>
     <l n="137">Had burned through all his being , till the ore</l>
     <l n="138">Glowed in him . Though no surface-stream of gold</l>
     <l n="139">Quick-molten slag of speech was his to spill</l>
     <l n="140">Unceasingly , the burning metal still</l>
     <l n="141">Seethed in him , from the broken furnace-side</l>
     <l n="142">To burst at any moment in a tide</l>
     <l n="143">Of white-hot molten iron o'er the mould ...</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="144">But still he spoke no word as they strolled on</l>
     <l n="145">Into the early-gathering Winter night :</l>
     <l n="146">And , as she watched the leaping furnace-light ,</l>
     <l n="147">She had no thought of smouldering fires unseen ...</l>
     <l n="148">The daylong clattering whirr of her machine</l>
     <l n="149">Hummed in her ears again — the straining thread</l>
     <l n="150">And stabbing needle starting through her head —</l>
     <l n="151">Until the last dull gleam of day was gone ...</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="152">When , all at once , upon the right ,</l>
     <l n="153">A crackling crash , a blinding flare ...</l>
     <l n="154">A shower of cinders through the air ...</l>
     <l n="155">A grind of blocks of slag aslide ...</l>
     <l n="156">And , far above them , in the night ,</l>
     <l n="157">The looming heap had opened wide</l>
     <l n="158">About a fiery , gaping pit ...</l>
     <l n="159">And , startled and aghast at it ,</l>
     <l n="160">With clasping hands they stood astare ,</l>
     <l n="161">And gazed upon the awful glare :</l>
     <l n="162">And , as she felt him clutch her hand ,</l>
     <l n="163">She seemed to know her heart 's desire ,</l>
     <l n="164">For evermore with him to stand</l>
     <l n="165">In that enkindling blaze of fire ...</l>
     <l n="166">When , suddenly , he left her side ;</l>
     <l n="167">And started scrambling up the heap :</l>
     <l n="168">And , looking up , with stifled cry ,</l>
     <l n="169">She saw , against the glowing sky ,</l>
     <l n="170">Almost upon the pit 's red brink ,</l>
     <l n="171">A little lad , stock-still with fright</l>
     <l n="172">Before the blazing pit of dread</l>
     <l n="173">Agape before him in the night ,</l>
     <l n="174">Where , playing castles on the height</l>
     <l n="175">Since noon , he 'd fallen , spent , asleep</l>
     <l n="176">And dreaming he was home in bed ...</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="177">With brain afire , too strained to think ,</l>
     <l n="178">She watched her lover climb and leap</l>
     <l n="179">From jag to jag</l>
     <l n="180">Of broken slag ...</l>
     <l n="181">And still he only seemed to creep ...</l>
     <l n="182">She felt that he would never reach</l>
     <l n="183">That little lad , though he should climb</l>
     <l n="184">Until the very end of time ...</l>
     <l n="185">And , as she looked , the burning breach</l>
     <l n="186">Gaped suddenly more wide ...</l>
     <l n="187">The slag again began to slide ,</l>
     <l n="188">And crash into the pit ,</l>
     <l n="189">Until the dazed lad 's feet</l>
     <l n="190">Stood on the edge of it .</l>
     <l n="191">She saw him reel and fall ...</l>
     <l n="192">And thought him done for ... then</l>
     <l n="193">Her lover , brave and tall ,</l>
     <l n="194">Against the glare and heat ,</l>
     <l n="195">A very fire-bright god of men !</l>
     <l n="196">He stooped ... and now she knew the lad</l>
     <l n="197">Was safe with Robert , after all .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="198">And while she watched , a throng of folk</l>
     <l n="199">Attracted by the crash and flare ,</l>
     <l n="200">Had gathered round , though no one spoke</l>
     <l n="201">But all stood terror-stricken there ,</l>
     <l n="202">With lifted eyes and indrawn breath ,</l>
     <l n="203">Until the lad was snatched from death</l>
     <l n="204">Upon the very pit 's edge , when ,</l>
     <l n="205">As Robert picked him up , and turned ,</l>
     <l n="206">A sigh ran through the crowd ; and fear</l>
     <l n="207">Gave place to joy , as cheer on cheer</l>
     <l n="208">Sang through the kindled air ...</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="209">But still she never uttered word ,</l>
     <l n="210">As though she neither saw nor heard ;</l>
     <l n="211">Till as , at last , her lad drew near ,</l>
     <l n="212">She saw him bend with tender care</l>
     <l n="213">Over the sobbing child who lay</l>
     <l n="214">Safe in his arms , and hug him tight</l>
     <l n="215">Against his breast — his brow alight</l>
     <l n="216">With eager , loving eyes that burned</l>
     <l n="217">In his transfigured face aflame ...</l>
     <l n="218">And even when the parents came</l>
     <l n="219">It almost seemed that he was loth</l>
     <l n="220">To yield them up their little son ;</l>
     <l n="221">As though the lad were his by right</l>
     <l n="222">Of rescue , from the pit 's edge won .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="223">Then , as his eyes met hers , she felt</l>
     <l n="224">An answering thrill of tenderness</l>
     <l n="225">Run , quickening , through her breast ; and both</l>
     <l n="226">Stood quivering there , with envious eyes ,</l>
     <l n="227">And stricken with a strange distress ,</l>
     <l n="228">As quickly homeward through the night</l>
     <l n="229">The happy parents bore their boy ...</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="230">And then , about her reeling bright ,</l>
     <l n="231">The whole night seemed to her to melt</l>
     <l n="232">In one fierce , fiery flood of joy .</l>
    </lg>
    <p>DEVIL 'S EDGE</p>
    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="233">All night I lay on Devil 's Edge ,</l>
     <l n="234">Along an overhanging ledge</l>
     <l n="235">Between the sky and sea :</l>
     <l n="236">And as I rested ‘ waiting sleep ,</l>
     <l n="237">The windless sky and soundless deep</l>
     <l n="238">In one dim , blue infinity</l>
     <l n="239">Of starry peace encompassed me .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="19">
     <l n="240">And I remembered , drowsily ,</l>
     <l n="241">How ‘ mid the hills last night I ‘ d lain</l>
     <l n="242">Beside a singing moorland burn ;</l>
     <l n="243">And waked at dawn , to feel the rain</l>
     <l n="244">Fall on my face , as on the fern</l>
     <l n="245">That drooped about my heather-bed :</l>
     <l n="246">And how by noon the wind had blown</l>
     <l n="247">The last grey shred from out the sky ,</l>
     <l n="248">And blew my homespun jacket dry ,</l>
     <l n="249">As I stood on the topmost stone</l>
     <l n="250">That crowns the cairn on Hawkshaw Head ,</l>
     <l n="251">And caught a gleam of far-off sea ;</l>

     <l n="563">Then , shivering in the keen night air ,</l>
     <l n="564">My sleepy sister , laughing came ;</l>
     <l n="565">And drew us in : and stirred to flame</l>
     <l n="566">The smouldering kitchen-fire ; and set</l>
     <l n="567">The kettle on the kindling red :</l>
     <l n="568">And , as I watched the homely blaze ,</l>
     <l n="569">And thought of wandering days</l>
     <l n="570">With sharp regret ;</l>
     <l n="571">I missed my father : then I heard</l>
     <l n="572">How he was still a-bed ;</l>
     <l n="573">And had been ailing , for a day or so ;</l>
     <l n="574">But , now was waking , if I 'd go ...</l>
     <l n="575">My foot already on the stair ,</l>
     <l n="576">In answer to my mother 's word</l>
     <l n="577">I turned ; and saw in dull amaze ,</l>
     <l n="578">Behind her , as she stood all unaware ,</l>
     <l n="579">An old man sitting in my father 's chair .</l>
     <l n="580">A strange old man ... yet , as I looked at him ,</l>
     <l n="581">Before my eyes , a dim</l>
     <l n="582">Remembrance seemed to swim</l>
     <l n="583">Of some old man , who 'd lurked about the boat ,</l>
     <l n="584">While we were still at sea ;</l>
     <l n="585">And who had crouched beside me , at the oar ,</l>
     <l n="586">As we had rowed ashore ;</l>
     <l n="587">Though , at the time , I 'd taken little note ,</l>
     <l n="588">I felt I 'd seen that strange old man before :</l>
     <l n="589">But , how he 'd come to follow me ,</l>
     <l n="590">Unknown ...</l>
     <l n="591">And to be sitting there ...</l>
     <l n="592">Then I recalled the cold breath in my hair ,</l>
     <l n="593">When I had stood , alone ,</l>
     <l n="594">Before the bolted door .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="41">
     <l n="595">And now my mother , wondering sore</l>
     <l n="596">To see me stare and stare ,</l>
     <l n="597">So strangely , at an empty chair ,</l>
     <l n="598">Turned , too ; and saw the old man there .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="42">
     <l n="599">And as she turned , he slowly raised</l>
     <l n="600">His drooping head ;</l>
     <l n="601">And looked upon her with her husband 's eyes .</l>
     <l n="602">She stood , a moment , dazed ;</l>
     <l n="603">And watched him slowly rise ,</l>
     <l n="604">As though to come to her :</l>
     <l n="605">Then , with a cry , she sped</l>
     <l n="606">Upstairs , ere I could stir .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="43">
     <l n="607">Still dazed , I let her go , alone :</l>
     <l n="608">I heard her footstep overhead :</l>
     <l n="609">I heard her drop beside the bed ,</l>
     <l n="610">With low forsaken moan .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="44">
     <l n="611">Yet , I could only stare and stare</l>
     <l n="612">Upon my father 's empty chair .</l>

    <p>THE HARE</p>
    <lg type="stanza" n="45">
     <l n="613">My hands were hot upon a hare ,</l>
     <l n="614">Half-strangled , struggling in a snare —</l>
     <l n="615">My knuckles at her warm wind-pipe —</l>
     <l n="616">When suddenly , her eyes shot back ,</l>
     <l n="617">Big , fearful , staggering and black :</l>
     <l n="618">And , ere I knew , my grip was slack ;</l>
     <l n="619">And I was clutching empty air ,</l>
     <l n="620">Half-mad , half-glad at my lost luck ...</l>
     <l n="621">When I awoke beside the stack .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="46">
     <l n="622">‘ Twas just the minute when the snipe ,</l>
     <l n="623">As though clock-wakened , every jack ,</l>
     <l n="624">An hour ere dawn , dart in and out</l>
     <l n="625">The mist-wreaths filling syke and slack ,</l>
     <l n="626">And flutter wheeling round about ,</l>
     <l n="627">And drumming out the Summer night .</l>
     <l n="628">I lay star-gazing yet a bit ;</l>
     <l n="629">Then , chilly-skinned , I sat upright ,</l>
     <l n="630">To shrug the shivers from my back ;</l>
     <l n="631">And , drawing out a straw to suck ,</l>
     <l n="632">My teeth nipped through it at a bite ...</l>
     <l n="633">The liveliest lad is out of pluck</l>
     <l n="634">An hour ere dawn — a tame cock-sparrow —</l>
     <l n="635">When cold stars shiver through his marrow ,</l>
     <l n="636">And wet mist soaks his mother-wit .</l>
     <l n="637">But , as the snipe dropped , one by one ;</l>
     <l n="638">And one by one the stars blinked out ;</l>
     <l n="639">I knew ‘ twould only need the sun</l>
     <l n="640">To send the shudders right about :</l>
     <l n="641">And , as the clear East faded white ,</l>
     <l n="642">I watched and wearied for the sun —</l>
     <l n="643">The jolly , welcome , friendly sun —</l>
     <l n="644">The sleepy sluggard of a sun</l>
     <l n="645">That still kept snoozing out of sight ,</l>
     <l n="646">Though well he knew the night was done</l>
     <l n="647">And , after all , he caught me dozing ,</l>
     <l n="648">And leapt up , laughing , in the sky</l>
     <l n="649">Just as my lazy eyes were closing :</l>
     <l n="650">And it was good as gold to lie</l>
     <l n="651">Full-length among the straw , and feel</l>
     <l n="652">The day wax warmer every minute ,</l>
     <l n="653">As , glowing glad , from head to heel ,</l>
     <l n="654">I soaked and rolled rejoicing in it ...</l>
     <l n="655">When from the corner of my eye ,</l>
     <l n="656">Upon a heathery knowe hard-by ,</l>
     <l n="657">With long lugs cocked , and eyes astare ,</l>
     <l n="658">Yet all serene , I saw a hare .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="47">
     <l n="659">Upon my belly in the straw ,</l>
     <l n="660">I lay , and watched her sleek her fur ,</l>
     <l n="661">As , daintily , with well-licked paw ,</l>
     <l n="662">She washed her face and neck and ears :</l>
     <l n="663">Then , clean and comely in the sun ,</l>
     <l n="664">She kicked her heels up , full of fun ,</l>
     <l n="665">As if she did not care a pin</l>
     <l n="666">Though she should jump out of her skin ,</l>
     <l n="667">And leapt and lolloped , free of fears ,</l>
     <l n="668">Until my heart frisked round with her .</l>
     <l n="669">“ And yet , if I but lift my head ,</l>
     <l n="670">You 'll scamper off , young Puss , ” I said .</l>
     <l n="671">“ Still , I can n't lie , and watch you play ,</l>
     <l n="672">Upon my belly half-the-day .</l>
     <l n="673">The Lord alone knows where I 'm going :</l>
     <l n="674">But , I had best be getting there .</l>
     <l n="675">Last night I loosed you from the snare —</l>
     <l n="676">Asleep , or waking , who 's for knowing !—</l>
     <l n="677">So , I shall thank you now for showing</l>
     <l n="678">Which art to take to bring me where</l>
     <l n="679">My luck awaits me . When you 're ready</l>
     <l n="680">To start , I 'll follow on your track .</l>
     <l n="681">Though slow of foot , I 'm sure and steady ... ”</l>
     <l n="682">She pricked her ears , then set them back ;</l>
     <l n="683">And like a shot was out of sight :</l>
     <l n="684">And , with a happy heart and light ,</l>
     <l n="685">As quickly I was on my feet ;</l>
     <l n="686">And following the way she went ,</l>
     <l n="687">Keen as a lurcher on the scent ,</l>
     <l n="688">Across the heather and the bent ,</l>
     <l n="689">Across the quaking moss and peat .</l>
     <l n="690">Of course , I lost her soon enough ,</l>
     <l n="691">For moorland tracks are steep and rough ;</l>
     <l n="692">And hares are made of nimbler stuff</l>
     <l n="693">Than any lad of seventeen ,</l>
     <l n="694">However lanky-legged and tough ,</l>
     <l n="695">However , kestrel-eyed and keen :</l>
     <l n="696">And I 'd at last to stop and eat</l>
     <l n="697">The little bit of bread and meat</l>
     <l n="698">Left in my pocket overnight .</l>
     <l n="699">So , in a hollow , snug and green ,</l>
     <l n="700">I sat beside a burn , and dipped</l>
     <l n="701">The dry bread in an icy pool ;</l>
     <l n="702">And munched a breakfast fresh and cool ...</l>
     <l n="703">And then sat gaping like a fool ...</l>
     <l n="704">For , right before my very eyes ,</l>
     <l n="705">With lugs acock , and eyes astare ,</l>
     <l n="706">I saw again the selfsame hare .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="48">
     <l n="707">So , up I jumped , and off she slipped :</l>
     <l n="708">And I kept sight of her until</l>
     <l n="709">I stumbled in a hole , and tripped ;</l>
     <l n="710">And came a heavy , headlong spill :</l>
     <l n="711">And she , ere I 'd the wit to rise ,</l>
     <l n="712">Was o'er the hill , and out of sight :</l>
     <l n="713">And , sore and shaken with the tumbling ,</l>
     <l n="714">And sicker at my foot for stumbling ,</l>
     <l n="715">I cursed my luck , and went on , grumbling ,</l>
     <l n="716">The way her flying heels had fled .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="49">
     <l n="717">The sky was cloudless overhead ;</l>
     <l n="718">And just alive with larks asinging :</l>
     <l n="719">And , in a twinkling , I was swinging</l>
     <l n="720">Across the windy hills , lighthearted .</l>
     <l n="721">A kestrel at my footstep started ,</l>
     <l n="722">Just pouncing on a frightened mouse ,</l>
     <l n="723">And hung o'erhead with wings a-hover :</l>
     <l n="724">Through rustling heath an adder darted :</l>
     <l n="725">A hundred rabbits bobbed to cover :</l>
     <l n="726">A weasel , sleek and rusty-red ,</l>
     <l n="727">Popped out of sight as quick as winking :</l>
     <l n="728">I saw a grizzled vixen slinking</l>
     <l n="729">Behind a clucking brood of grouse</l>
     <l n="730">That rose and cackled at my coming :</l>
     <l n="731">And all about my way were flying</l>
     <l n="732">The peewit , with their slow wings creaking</l>
     <l n="733">And little jack-snipe darted , drumming :</l>
     <l n="734">And now and then a golden plover</l>
     <l n="735">Or redshank piped with reedy whistle .</l>
     <l n="736">But never shaken bent or thistle</l>
     <l n="737">Betrayed the quarry I was seeking</l>
     <l n="738">And not an instant , anywhere</l>
     <l n="739">Did I clap eyes upon a hare .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="50">
     <l n="740">So , travelling still , the twilight caught me :</l>
     <l n="741">And as I stumbled on , I muttered :</l>
     <l n="742">“ A deal of luck the hare has brought me !</l>
     <l n="743">The wind and I must spend together</l>
     <l n="744">A hungry night among the heather .</l>
     <l n="745">If I 'd her here ... ” And as I uttered ,</l>
     <l n="746">I tripped , and heard a frightened squeal ;</l>
     <l n="747">And dropped my hands in time to feel</l>
     <l n="748">The hare just bolting ‘ twixt my feet .</l>
     <l n="749">She slipped my clutch : and I stood there</l>
     <l n="750">And cursed that devil-littered hare ,</l>
     <l n="751">That left me stranded in the dark</l>
     <l n="752">In that wide waste of quaggy peat</l>
     <l n="753">Beneath black night without a spark :</l>
     <l n="754">When , looking up , I saw a flare</l>
     <l n="755">Upon a far-off hill , and said :</l>
     <l n="756">“ By God , the heather is afire !</l>
     <l n="757">It 's mischief at this time of year ... ”</l>
     <l n="758">And then , as one bright flame shot higher ,</l>
     <l n="759">And booths and vans stood out quite clear ;</l>
     <l n="760">My wits came back into my head :</l>
     <l n="761">And I remembered Brough Hill Fair .</l>
     <l n="762">And , as I stumbled towards the glare ,</l>
     <l n="763">I knew the sudden kindling meant</l>
     <l n="764">The Fair was over for the day ;</l>
     <l n="765">And all the cattle-folk away</l>
     <l n="766">And gipsy-folk and tinkers now</l>
     <l n="767">Were lighting supper-fires without</l>
     <l n="768">Each caravan and booth and tent .</l>
     <l n="769">And , as I climbed the stiff hill-brow ,</l>
     <l n="770">I quite forgot my lucky hare .</l>
     <l n="771">I 'd something else to think about :</l>
     <l n="772">For well I knew there 's broken meat</l>
     <l n="773">For empty bellies after fair-time ;</l>
     <l n="774">And looked to have a royal rare time</l>
     <l n="775">With something rich and prime to eat :</l>
     <l n="776">And then to lie and toast my feet</l>
     <l n="777">All night beside the biggest fire .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="51">
     <l n="778">But , even as I neared the first ,</l>
     <l n="779">A pleasant whiff of stewing burst</l>
     <l n="780">From out a smoking pot a-bubble :</l>
     <l n="781">And , as I stopped behind the folk</l>
     <l n="782">Who sprawled around , and watched it seething</l>
     <l n="783">A woman heard my eager breathing ,</l>
     <l n="784">And , turning , caught my hungry eye :</l>
     <l n="785">And called out to me : “ Draw in nigher ,</l>
     <l n="786">Unless you find it too much trouble ;</l>
     <l n="787">Or you 've a nose for better fare ,</l>
     <l n="788">And go to supper with the Squire ...</l>
     <l n="789">You 've got the hungry parson 's air ! ”</l>
     <l n="790">And all looked up , and took the joke ,</l>
     <l n="791">As I dropped gladly to the ground</l>
     <l n="792">Among them , where they all lay gazing</l>
     <l n="793">Upon the bubbling and the blazing .</l>
     <l n="794">My eyes were dazzled by the fire</l>
     <l n="795">At first ; and then I glanced around ;</l>
     <l n="796">And , in those swarthy , fire-lit faces —</l>
     <l n="797">Though drowsing in the glare and heat</l>
     <l n="798">And snuffing the warm savour in ,</l>
     <l n="799">Dead-certain of their fill of meat —</l>
     <l n="800">I felt the bit between the teeth ,</l>
     <l n="801">The flying heels , the broken traces ,</l>
     <l n="802">And heard the highroad ring beneath</l>
     <l n="803">The trampling hoofs : and knew them kin .</l>
     <l n="804">Then for the first time , standing there</l>
     <l n="805">Behind the woman who had hailed me ,</l>
     <l n="806">I saw a girl with eyes astare</l>
     <l n="807">That looked in terror o'er my head :</l>
     <l n="808">And , all at once , my courage failed me ...</l>
     <l n="809">For now again , and sore-adread ,</l>
     <l n="810">My hands were hot upon a hare ,</l>
     <l n="811">That struggled , strangling in the snare ...</l>
     <l n="812">Then once more as the girl stood clear ,</l>
     <l n="813">Before me — quaking cold with fear</l>
     <l n="814">I saw the hare look from her eyes ...</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="52">
     <l n="815">And when , at last , I turned to see</l>
     <l n="816">What held her scared , I saw a man —</l>
     <l n="817">A fat man with dull eyes aleer —</l>
     <l n="818">Within the shadow of the van :</l>
     <l n="819">And I was on the point to rise</l>
     <l n="820">To send him spinning ‘ mid the wheels ,</l>
     <l n="821">And twist his neck between his heels ,</l>
     <l n="822">And stop his leering grin with mud ...</l>
     <l n="823">And would have done it in a tick ...</l>
     <l n="824">When , suddenly , alive with fright ,</l>
     <l n="825">She started , with red , parted lips ,</l>
     <l n="826">As though she guessed we 'd come to grips ,</l>
     <l n="827">And turned her black eyes full on me ...</l>
     <l n="828">And , as I looked into their light ,</l>
     <l n="829">My heart forgot the lust of fight ,</l>
     <l n="830">And something shot me to the quick ,</l>
     <l n="831">And ran like wildfire through my blood ,</l>
     <l n="832">And tingled to my finger-tips ...</l>
     <l n="833">And , in a dazzling flash , I knew</l>
     <l n="834">I 'd never been alive before ...</l>
     <l n="835">And she was mine for evermore .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="53">
     <l n="836">While all the others slept asnore</l>
     <l n="837">In caravan and tent that night ,</l>
     <l n="838">I lay alone beside the fire ;</l>
     <l n="839">And stared into its blazing core ,</l>
     <l n="840">With eyes that would not shut or tire ,</l>
     <l n="841">Because the best of all was true ,</l>
     <l n="842">And they looked still into the light</l>
     <l n="843">Of her eyes , burning ever bright .</l>
     <l n="844">Within the brightest coal for me ...</l>
     <l n="845">Once more , I saw her , as she started ,</l>
     <l n="846">And glanced at me with red lips parted :</l>
     <l n="847">And , as she looked , the frightened hare</l>
     <l n="848">Had fled her eyes ; and , merrily ,</l>
     <l n="849">She smiled , with fine teeth flashing white ,</l>
     <l n="850">As though she , too , were happy-hearted ...</l>
     <l n="851">Then she had trembled suddenly ,</l>
     <l n="852">And dropped her eyes , as that fat man</l>
     <l n="853">Stepped from the shadow of the van ,</l>
     <l n="854">And joined the circle , as the pot</l>
     <l n="855">Was lifted off , and , piping-hot ,</l>
     <l n="856">The supper steamed in wooden bowls .</l>
     <l n="857">Yet , she had hardly touched a bite :</l>
     <l n="858">And never raised her eyes all night</l>
     <l n="859">To mine again : but on the coals ,</l>
     <l n="860">As I sat staring , she had stared —</l>
     <l n="861">The black curls , shining round her head</l>
     <l n="862">From under the red kerchief , tied</l>
     <l n="863">So nattily beneath her chin —</l>
     <l n="864">And she had stolen off to bed</l>
     <l n="865">Quite early , looking dazed and scared .</l>
     <l n="866">Then , all agape and sleepy-eyed ,</l>
     <l n="867">Ere long the others had turned in :</l>
     <l n="868">And I was rid of that fat man ,</l>
     <l n="869">Who slouched away to his own van .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="54">
     <l n="870">And now , before her van , I lay ,</l>
     <l n="871">With sleepless eyes , awaiting day :</l>
     <l n="872">And , as I gazed upon the glare ,</l>
     <l n="873">I heard , behind , a gentle stir :</l>
     <l n="874">And , turning round , I looked on her</l>
     <l n="875">Where she stood on the little stair</l>
     <l n="876">Outside the van , with listening air —</l>
     <l n="877">And , in her eyes , the hunted hare ...</l>
     <l n="878">And then , I saw her slip away ,</l>
     <l n="879">A bundle underneath her arm ,</l>
     <l n="880">Without a single glance at me .</l>
     <l n="881">I lay a moment wondering ,</l>
     <l n="882">My heart a-thump like anything ,</l>
     <l n="883">Then , fearing she should come to harm ,</l>
     <l n="884">I rose , and followed speedily</l>
     <l n="885">Where she had vanished in the night .</l>
     <l n="886">And , as she heard my step behind ,</l>
     <l n="887">She started , and stopt dead with fright :</l>
     <l n="888">Then blundered on as if struck blind :</l>
     <l n="889">And now as I caught up with her ,</l>
     <l n="890">Just as she took the moorland track ,</l>
     <l n="891">I saw the hare 's eyes , big and black ...</l>
     <l n="892">She made as though she 'd double back ...</l>
     <l n="893">But , when she looked into my eyes ,</l>
     <l n="894">She stood quite still and did not stir ...</l>
     <l n="895">And , picking up her fallen pack ,</l>
     <l n="896">I tucked it ‘ neath my arm ; and she</l>
     <l n="897">Just took her luck quite quietly .</l>
     <l n="898">As she must take what chance might come ,</l>
     <l n="899">And would not have it otherwise ,</l>
     <l n="900">And walked into the night with me ,</l>
     <l n="901">Without a word across the fells .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="55">
     <l n="902">And , all about us , through the night ,</l>
     <l n="903">The mists were stealing , cold and white ,</l>
     <l n="904">Down every rushy syke or slack :</l>
     <l n="905">But , soon the moon swung into sight :</l>
     <l n="906">And , as we went , my heart was light ,</l>
     <l n="907">And singing like a burn in flood :</l>
     <l n="908">And in my ears were tinkling bells :</l>
     <l n="909">My body was a rattled drum :</l>
     <l n="910">And fifes were shrilling through my blood</l>
     <l n="911">That summer night , to think that she</l>
     <l n="912">Was walking through the world with me .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="56">
     <l n="913">But when the air with dawn was chill ,</l>
     <l n="914">As we were travelling down a hill ,</l>
     <l n="915">She broke her silence with low-sobbing :</l>
     <l n="916">And told her tale , her bosom throbbing</l>
     <l n="917">As though her very heart were shaken</l>
     <l n="918">With fear she 'd yet be overtaken ...</l>
     <l n="919">She 'd always lived in caravans —</l>
     <l n="920">Her father 's , gay as any man 's ,</l>
     <l n="921">Grass-green , picked out with red and yellow</l>
     <l n="922">And glittering brave with burnished brass</l>
     <l n="923">That sparkled in the sun like flame ,</l>
     <l n="924">And window curtains , white as snow ...</l>
     <l n="925">But , they had died , ten years ago ,</l>
     <l n="926">Her parents both , when fever came ...</l>
     <l n="927">And they were buried , side by side ,</l>
     <l n="928">Somewhere beneath the wayside grass ...</l>
     <l n="929">In times of sickness , they kept wide</l>
     <l n="930">Of towns and busybodies , so</l>
     <l n="931">No parson 's or policeman 's tricks</l>
     <l n="932">Should bother them when in a fix ...</l>
     <l n="933">Her father never could abide</l>
     <l n="934">A black coat or a blue , poor man ...</l>
     <l n="935">And so , Long Dick , a kindly fellow ,</l>
     <l n="936">When you could keep him from the can ,</l>
     <l n="937">And Meg , his easy-going wife ,</l>
     <l n="938">Had taken her into their van ;</l>
     <l n="939">And kept her since her parents died ...</l>
     <l n="940">And she had lived a happy life ,</l>
     <l n="941">Until Fat Pete 's young wife was taken ...</l>
     <l n="942">But , ever since , he 'd pestered her ...</l>
     <l n="943">And she dared scarcely breathe or stir ,</l>
     <l n="944">Lest she should see his eyes aleer ...</l>
     <l n="945">And many a night she 'd lain and shaken ,</l>
     <l n="946">And very nearly died of fear —</l>
     <l n="947">Though safe enough within the van</l>
     <l n="948">With Mother Meg and her good-man —</l>
     <l n="949">For , since Fat Pete was Long Dick 's friend ,</l>
     <l n="950">And they were thick and sweet as honey ;</l>
     <l n="951">And Dick owed Pete a pot of money ,</l>
     <l n="952">She knew too well how it must end ...</l>
     <l n="953">And she would rather lie stone dead</l>
     <l n="954">Beneath the wayside grass than wed</l>
     <l n="955">With leering Pete , and live the life ,</l>
     <l n="956">And die the death , of his first wife ...</l>
     <l n="957">And so , last night , clean-daft with dread ,</l>
     <l n="958">She 'd bundled up a pack and fled ...</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="57">
     <l n="959">When all the sobbing tale was out ,</l>
     <l n="960">She dried her eyes , and looked about ,</l>
     <l n="961">As though she 'd left all fear behind ,</l>
     <l n="962">And out of sight were out of mind .</l>
     <l n="963">Then , when the dawn was burning red ,</l>
     <l n="964">“ I 'm hungry as a hawk ! ” she said :</l>
     <l n="965">And from the bundle took out bread .</l>
     <l n="966">And , at the happy end of night ,</l>
     <l n="967">We sat together by a burn :</l>
     <l n="968">And ate a thick slice , turn by turn ;</l>
     <l n="969">And laughed and kissed between each bite .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="58">
     <l n="970">Then , up again , and on our way</l>
     <l n="971">We went ; and tramped the livelong day</l>
     <l n="972">The moorland trackways , steep and rough ,</l>
     <l n="973">Though there was little fear enough</l>
     <l n="974">That they would follow on our flight .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="59">
     <l n="975">And then again a shiny night</l>
     <l n="976">Among the honey-scented heather ,</l>
     <l n="977">We wandered in the moonblaze bright ,</l>
     <l n="978">Together through a land of light ,</l>
     <l n="979">A lad and lass alone with life .</l>
     <l n="980">And merrily we laughed together ,</l>
     <l n="981">When , starting up from sleep , we heard</l>
     <l n="982">The cock-grouse talking to his wife ...</l>
     <l n="983">And “ Old Fat Pete ” she called the bird .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="60">
     <l n="984">Six months and more have cantered by :</l>
     <l n="985">And , Winter past , we 're out again —</l>
     <l n="986">We 've left the fat and weatherwise</l>
     <l n="987">To keep their coops and reeking sties ,</l>
     <l n="988">And eat their fill of oven-pies ,</l>
     <l n="989">While we win free and out again</l>
     <l n="990">To take potluck beneath the sky</l>
     <l n="991">With sun and moon and wind and rain .</l>
     <l n="992">Six happy months ... and yet , at night ,</l>
     <l n="993">I 've often wakened in affright ,</l>
     <l n="994">And looked upon her lying there ,</l>
     <l n="995">Beside me sleeping quietly ,</l>
     <l n="996">Adread that when she waked , I 'd see</l>
     <l n="997">The hunted hare within her eyes .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="61">
     <l n="998">And , only last night , as I slept</l>
     <l n="999">Beneath the shelter of a stack ...</l>
     <l n="1000">My hands were hot upon a hare ,</l>
     <l n="1001">Half-strangled , struggling in the snare ,</l>
     <l n="1002">When , suddenly , her eyes shot back ,</l>
     <l n="1003">Big , fearful , staggering and black ;</l>
     <l n="1004">And ere I knew , my grip was slack ,</l>
     <l n="1005">And I was clutching empty air ...</l>
     <l n="1006">Bolt-upright from my sleep I leapt ...</l>
     <l n="1007">Her place was empty in the straw ...</l>
     <l n="1008">And then , with quaking heart , I saw</l>
     <l n="1009">That she was standing in the night ,</l>
     <l n="1010">A leveret cuddled to her breast ...</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="62">
     <l n="1011">I spoke no word : but , as the light</l>
     <l n="1012">Through banks of Eastern cloud was breaking ,</l>
     <l n="1013">She turned , and saw that I was waking :</l>
     <l n="1014">And told me how she could not rest ;</l>
     <l n="1015">And , rising in the night , she 'd found</l>
     <l n="1016">This baby-hare crouched on the ground ;</l>
     <l n="1017">And she had nursed it quite a while :</l>
     <l n="1018">But , now , she 'd better let it go ...</l>
     <l n="1019">Its mother would be fretting so ...</l>
     <l n="1020">A mother 's heart ...</l>
     <l n="1021">I saw her smile ,</l>
     <l n="1022">And look at me with tender eyes :</l>
     <l n="1023">And as I looked into their light ,</l>
     <l n="1024">My foolish , fearful heart grew wise ...</l>
     <l n="1025">And now , I knew that never there</l>
     <l n="1026">I 'd see again the startled hare ,</l>
     <l n="1027">Or need to dread the dreams of night .</l>
