     <l n="3">Pluck three hardy hairs from a rabbit-skin rug ;</l>
     <l n="4">Blow one to the South , and one to the West ,</l>
     <l n="5">Then burn another and swallow the rest .</l>
     <l n="6">And who shall explain ‘ tis the talk of a fool ,</l>
     <l n="7">He 's a Glug ! He 's a Glug of the old Gosh school !</l>
     <l n="8">And he 'll climb a tree , if the East wind blows ,</l>
     <l n="9">In a casual way , just to show he knows . . .</l>
     <l n="10">Now , tickle his toes !</l>
     <l n="11">Oh , tickle his toes !</l>

     <lg type="stanza" n="1">
      <l n="1">Follow the river and cross the ford ,</l>
      <l n="2">Follow again to the wobbly bridge ,</l>
      <l n="3">Turn to the left at the notice board ,</l>
      <l n="4">Climbing the cow-track over the ridge ;</l>
      <l n="5">Tip-toe soft by the little red house ,</l>
      <l n="6">Hold your breath if they touch the latch ,</l>
      <l n="7">Creep to the slip-rails , still as a mouse ,</l>
      <l n="8">Then . . . run like mad for the bracken patch .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="2">
      <l n="9">Worm your way where the fern fronds tall</l>
      <l n="10">Fashion a lace-work over your head ,</l>
      <l n="11">Hemming you in with a high , green wall ;</l>
      <l n="12">Then , when the thrush calls once , stop dead .</l>
      <l n="13">Ask of the old grey wallaby there —</l>
      <l n="14">Him prick-eared by the woollybutt tree —</l>
      <l n="15">How to encounter a Glug , and where</l>
      <l n="16">The country of Gosh , famed Gosh may be .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="3">
      <l n="17">But , if he is scornful , if he is dumb ,</l>
      <l n="18">Hush ! There 's another way left . Then come .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="4">
      <l n="19">On a white , still night , where the dead tree bends</l>
      <l n="20">Over the track , like a waiting ghost ,</l>
      <l n="21">Travel the winding road that wends</l>
      <l n="22">Down to the shore on an Eastern coast .</l>
      <l n="23">Follow it down where the wake of the moon</l>
      <l n="24">Kisses the ripples of silver sand ;</l>
      <l n="25">Follow it on where the night seas croon</l>
      <l n="26">A traveller 's tale to the listening land .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="5">
      <l n="27">Step not jauntily , not too grave ,</l>
      <l n="28">Till the lip of the languorous sea you greet ;</l>
      <l n="29">Wait till the wash of the thirteenth wave</l>
      <l n="30">Tumbles a jellyfish out at your feet .</l>
      <l n="31">Not too hopefully , not forlorn ,</l>
      <l n="32">Whisper a word of your earnest quest ;</l>
      <l n="33">Shed not a tear if he turns in scorn</l>
      <l n="34">And sneers in your face like a fish possessed .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="6">
      <l n="35">Hist ! Hope on ! There is yet a way .</l>
      <l n="36">Brooding jellyfish wo n't be gay .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="7">
      <l n="37">Wait till the clock in the tower booms three ,</l>
      <l n="38">And the big bank opposite gnashes its doors ,</l>
      <l n="39">Then glide with a gait that is carefully free</l>
      <l n="40">By the great brick building of seventeen floors ;</l>
      <l n="41">Haste by the draper who smirks at his door ,</l>
      <l n="42">Straining to lure you with sinister force ,</l>
      <l n="43">Turn up the lane by the second-hand store ,</l>
      <l n="44">And halt by the light bay carrier 's horse .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="8">
      <l n="45">By the carrier 's horse with the long , sad face</l>
      <l n="46">And the wisdom of years in his mournful eye ;</l>
      <l n="47">Bow to him thrice with a courtier 's grace ,</l>
      <l n="48">Proffer your query , and pause for reply .</l>
      <l n="49">Eagerly ask for a hint of the Glug ,</l>
      <l n="50">Pause for reply with your hat in your hand ;</l>
      <l n="51">If he responds with a snort and a shrug</l>
      <l n="52">Strive to interpret and understand .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="9">
      <l n="53">Rare will a carrier 's horse condescend .</l>
      <l n="54">Yet there 's another way . On to the end !</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="10">
      <l n="55">Catch the four-thirty ; your ticket in hand ,</l>
      <l n="56">Punched by the porter who broods in his box ;</l>
      <l n="57">Journey afar to the sad , soggy land ,</l>
      <l n="58">Wearing your shot-silk lavender socks .</l>
      <l n="59">Wait at the creek by the moss-grown log</l>
      <l n="60">Till the blood of a slain day reddens the West .</l>
      <l n="61">Hark for the croak of a gentleman frog ,</l>
      <l n="62">Of a corpulent frog with a white satin vest .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="11">
      <l n="63">Go as he guides you , over the marsh ,</l>
      <l n="64">Treading with care on the slithery stones ,</l>
      <l n="65">Heedless of night winds moaning and harsh</l>
      <l n="66">That seize you and freeze you and search for your bones .</l>
      <l n="67">On to the edge of a still , dark pool ,</l>
      <l n="68">Banishing thoughts of your warm wool rug ;</l>
      <l n="69">Gaze in the depths of it , placid and cool ,</l>
      <l n="70">And long in your heart for one glimpse of a Glug .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="12">
      <l n="71">“ Krock ! ” Was he mocking you ? “ Krock ! Kor-r-rock ! ”</l>
      <l n="72">Well , you bought a return , and it 's past ten o'clock .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="13">
      <l n="73">Choose you a night when the intimate stars</l>
      <l n="74">Carelessly prattle of cosmic affairs .</l>
      <l n="75">Flat on your back , with your nose pointing Mars ,</l>
      <l n="76">Search for the star who fled South from the Bears .</l>
      <l n="77">Gaze for an hour at that little blue star ,</l>
      <l n="78">Giving him , cheerfully , wink for his wink ;</l>
      <l n="79">Shrink to the size of the being you are ;</l>
      <l n="80">Sneeze if you have to , but softly ; then think .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="14">
      <l n="81">Throw wide the portals and let your thoughts run</l>
      <l n="82">Over the earth like a galloping herd .</l>
      <l n="83">Bounds to profundity let there be none ,</l>
      <l n="84">Let there be nothing too madly absurd .</l>
      <l n="85">Ponder on pebbles or stock exchange shares ,</l>
      <l n="86">On the mission of man or the life of a bug ,</l>
      <l n="87">On planets or billiards , policemen or bears ,</l>
      <l n="88">Alert all the time for the sight of a Glug .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="15">
      <l n="89">Meditate deeply on softgoods or sex ,</l>
      <l n="90">On carraway seeds or the causes of bills ,</l>
      <l n="91">Biology , art , or mysterious wrecks ,</l>
      <l n="92">Or the tattered white fleeces of clouds on blue hills .</l>
      <l n="93">Muse upon ologies , freckles and fog ,</l>
      <l n="94">Why hermits live lonely and grapes in a bunch ,</l>
      <l n="95">On the ways of a child or the mind of a dog ,</l>
      <l n="96">Or the oyster you bolted last Friday at lunch .</l>
     </lg>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Heard you no sound like a shuddering sigh ! Or the great shout of laughter that swept down the sky ? Saw you no sign on the wide Milky Way ? Then there 's naught left to you now but to pray .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Sit you at eve when the Shepherd in Blue</l>
     <l n="2">Calls from the West to his clustering sheep .</l>
     <l n="3">Then pray for the moods that old mariners woo ,</l>
     <l n="4">For the thoughts of young mothers who watch their babes sleep .</l>
     <l n="5">Pray for the heart of an innocent child ,</l>
     <l n="6">For the tolerant scorn of a weary old man ,</l>
     <l n="7">For the petulant grief of a prophet reviled ,</l>
     <l n="8">For the wisdom you lost when your whiskers began .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">Pray for the pleasures that he who was you</l>
     <l n="10">Found in the mud of a shower-fed pool ,</l>
     <l n="11">For the fears that he felt and the joys that he knew</l>
     <l n="12">When a little green lizard crept into the school .</l>
     <l n="13">Pray as they pray who are maddened by wine :</l>
     <l n="14">For distraction from self and a spirit at rest .</l>
     <l n="15">Now , deep in the heart of you search for a sign —</l>
     <l n="16">If there be naught of it , vain is your quest .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="17">Lay down the book , for to follow the tale</l>
     <l n="18">Were to trade in false blame , as all mortals who fail .</l>
     <l n="19">And may the gods salve you on life 's dreary round ;</l>
     <l n="20">For ‘ tis whispered : “ Who finds not , ‘ tis he shall be found ! ”</l>

     <head>II . JOI , THE GLUG</head>
     <lg type="stanza" n="4">
      <l n="21">The Glugs abide in a far , far land</l>
      <l n="22">That is partly pebbles and stones and sand</l>
      <l n="23">But mainly earth of a chocolate hue ,</l>
      <l n="24">When it is n't purple or slightly blue .</l>
      <l n="25">And the Glugs live there with their aunts and their wives ,</l>
      <l n="26">In draught-proof tenements all their lives .</l>
      <l n="27">And they climb the trees when the weather is wet ,</l>
      <l n="28">To see how high they can really get .</l>
      <l n="29">Pray , do n't forget ,</l>
      <l n="30">This is chiefly done when the weather is wet .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="5">
      <l n="31">And every shadow that flits and hides ,</l>
      <l n="32">And every stream that glistens and glides</l>
      <l n="33">And laughs its way from a highland height ,</l>
      <l n="34">All know the Glugs quite well by sight .</l>
      <l n="35">And they say , “ Our test is the best by far ;</l>
      <l n="36">For a Glug is a Glug ; so there you are !</l>
      <l n="37">And they climb the trees when it drizzles or hails</l>
      <l n="38">To get electricity into their nails ;</l>
      <l n="39">And the Glug that fails</l>
      <l n="40">Is a luckless Glug , if it drizzles or hails . ”</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="6">
      <l n="41">Now , the Glugs abide in the lands of Gosh ;</l>
      <l n="42">And they work all day for the sake of Splosh .</l>
      <l n="43">For Splosh , the First , is the Nation 's pride ,</l>
      <l n="44">And King of the Glugs , on his uncle 's side .</l>
      <l n="45">And they sleep at night , for the sake of rest ;</l>
      <l n="46">For their doctors say this suits them best .</l>
      <l n="47">And they climb the trees , as a general rule ,</l>
      <l n="48">For exercise , when the weather is cool .</l>
      <l n="49">They 're taught at school</l>
      <l n="50">To climb the trees when the weather is cool .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="7">
      <l n="51">And the whispering grass on the gay green hills</l>
      <l n="52">And every cricket that skirls and shrills ,</l>
      <l n="53">And every moonbeam , gleaming white ,</l>
      <l n="54">All know the Glugs quite well by sight .</l>
      <l n="55">And they say , “ It is safe , it is the test we bring ;</l>
      <l n="56">For a Glug is an awful Gluglike thing .</l>
      <l n="57">And they climb the trees when there 's a sign of fog ,</l>
      <l n="58">To scan the land for a feasible dog .</l>
      <l n="59">They love to jog</l>
      <l n="60">Thro ’ dells in quest of a feasible dog . ”</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="8">
      <l n="61">The Glugs eat meals three times a day</l>
      <l n="62">Because their fathers ate that way .</l>
      <l n="63">Their grandpas said the scheme was good</l>
      <l n="64">To help the Glugs digest their food .</l>
      <l n="65">And ‘ tis wholesome food the Glugs have got ,</l>
      <l n="66">For it says so plain on the tin and pot .</l>
      <l n="67">And they climb the trees when the weather is dry</l>
      <l n="68">To get a glimpse of the pale green sky .</l>
      <l n="69">We do n't know why ,</l>
      <l n="70">But they like to gaze on the pale green sky .</l>

     <lg type="stanza" n="9">
      <l n="71">And every cloud that sails aloft ,</l>
      <l n="72">And every breeze that blows so soft ,</l>

      <l n="74">All know the Glugs quite well by sight .</l>
      <l n="75">For they say , “ Our test , it is safe and true ;</l>
      <l n="76">What one Glug does , the other Glugs do ;</l>
      <l n="77">And they climb the trees when the weather is hot ,</l>
      <l n="78">For a birds ’ - eye view of the garden plot .</l>
      <l n="79">Of course , it 's rot ,</l>
      <l n="80">But they love that view of the garden plot . ”</l>

     <lg type="stanza" n="10">
      <l n="81">At half-past two on a Wednesday morn</l>
      <l n="82">A most peculiar Glug was born ;</l>
      <l n="83">And later on , when he grew a man ,</l>
      <l n="84">He scoffed and sneered at the Chosen Plan .</l>
      <l n="85">“ It 's wrong ! ” said this Glug , whose name was Joi .</l>
      <l n="86">“ Bah ! ” said the Glugs . “ He 's a crazy boy ! ”</l>
      <l n="87">And they climbed the trees , as the West wind stirred ,</l>
      <l n="88">To hark to the note of the Guffer Bird .</l>
      <l n="89">It seems absurd ,</l>
      <l n="90">But they 're foolishly fond of the Guffer Bird .</l>

      <l n="91">And every reed that rustles and sways</l>
      <l n="92">By the gurgling river that plashes and plays ,</l>

      <l n="94">All know the Glugs quite well by sight .</l>
      <l n="95">And , “ Why , ” say they ; “ It is easily done ;</l>
      <l n="96">For a dexter Glug 's like a sinister one ! ”</l>
      <l n="97">And they climb the trees . Oh , they climb the trees !</l>
      <l n="98">And they bark their knuckles , and chafe their knees ;</l>
      <l n="99">And ‘ tis one of the world 's great mysteries</l>

      <l n="103">And a wonderful tale I ween ,</l>
      <l n="104">Of the Glugs of Gosh and their great King Splosh ,</l>
      <l n="105">And Tush , his virtuous Queen .</l>
      <l n="106">And here is a tale of the crafty Ogs ,</l>
      <l n="107">In their neighbouring land of Podge ;</l>
      <l n="108">Of their sayings and doings and plottings and brewings ,</l>
      <l n="109">And something about Sir Stodge .</l>
      <l n="110">Wise to profundity ,</l>
      <l n="111">Stout to rotundity ,</l>
      <l n="112">That was the Knight , Sir Stodge .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="13">
      <l n="113">Oh , the King was rich , and the Queen was fair ,</l>
      <l n="114">And they made a very respectable pair .</l>
      <l n="115">And whenever a Glug in that peaceful land ,</l>
      <l n="116">Did anything no one could understand ,</l>
      <l n="117">The Knight , Sir Stodge , he looked in a book ,</l>
      <l n="118">And charged that Glug with a crime called Crook .</l>
      <l n="119">And the great Judge Fudge , who wore for a hat</l>
      <l n="120">The sacred skin of a tortoiseshell cat ,</l>
      <l n="121">He fined that Glug for his action rash ,</l>
      <l n="122">And frequently asked a deposit in cash .</l>
      <l n="123">Then every Glug , he went home to his rest</l>
      <l n="124">With his head in a bag and his toes to the West ;</l>
      <l n="125">For they knew it was best ,</l>
      <l n="126">Since their grandpas slept with their toes to the West .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="14">
      <l n="127">But all of the tale that is so far told</l>
      <l n="128">Has nothing whatever to do</l>
      <l n="129">With the Ogs of Podge , and their crafty dodge ,</l>
      <l n="130">And the trade in pickles and glue .</l>
      <l n="131">To trade with the Glugs came the Ogs to Gosh ,</l>
      <l n="132">And they said in seductive tones ,</l>
      <l n="133">“ We 'll sell you pianers and pickels and spanners</l>
      <l n="134">For seventeen shiploads of stones :</l>
      <l n="135">Smooth ‘ uns or nobbly ‘ uns ,</l>
      <l n="136">Firm ‘ uns or wobbly ‘ uns ,</l>

      <l n="138">And the King said , “ What ? ” and the Queen said , “ Why ,</l>
      <l n="139">That is awfully cheap to the things I buy !</l>
      <l n="140">For that grocer of ours in the light brown hat</l>
      <l n="141">Asks two and eleven for pickles like that ! ”</l>
      <l n="142">But a Glug stood up with a wart on his nose ,</l>
      <l n="143">And cried , “ Your Majesties ! Ogs is foes ! ”</l>
      <l n="144">But the Glugs cried , “ Peace ! Will you hold your jaw !</l>
      <l n="145">How did our grandpas fashion the law ? ”</l>
      <l n="146">Said the Knight , Sir Stodge , as he opened his Book ,</l>
      <l n="147">“ When the goods were cheap then the goods we took . ”</l>
      <l n="148">So they fined the Glug with the wart on his nose</l>

      <l n="153">Do you notice the dodge ?</l>

     <lg type="stanza" n="16">
      <l n="155">In the following Summer the Ogs came back</l>

      <l n="162">For goods you will settle</l>
      <l n="163">Indented by your Mister Ghones . ”</l>
      <l n="164">Cried the Glugs praisingly ,</l>

      <l n="169">But a Glug stood up with some very large ears ,</l>
      <l n="170">And said , “ There is more in this thing than appears !</l>
      <l n="171">And we ought to be taxing those goods of the Ogs ,</l>
      <l n="172">Or our industries soon will be gone to the dogs . ”</l>
      <l n="173">And the King said , “ Bosh ! You 're un-Gluggish and rude ! ”</l>
      <l n="174">And the Queen said , “ What an absurd attitude ! ”</l>
      <l n="175">Then the Glugs cried , “ Down with political quacks !</l>
      <l n="176">How did our grandpas look at a tax ? ”</l>
      <l n="177">So the Knight , Sir Stodge , he opened his Book .</l>
      <l n="178">“ No tax , ” said he , “ wherever I look . ”</l>
      <l n="179">Then they fined the Glug with the prominent ears</l>
      <l n="180">For being old-fashioned by several years ;</l>
      <l n="181">And the Ogs went home with the stones , full-steam .</l>
      <l n="182">Did you notice the scheme ?</l>
      <l n="183">Nor yet did the Glugs in their dreamiest dreams .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="18">
      <l n="184">Then every month to the land of the Gosh</l>

      <l n="190">And the Glugs , while copncealing their joy in the dealing ,</l>
      <l n="191">Paid promptly in nothing but stones .</l>
      <l n="192">Why , it was screamingly</l>
      <l n="193">Laughable , seemingly — -</l>
      <l n="194">Asking for nothing but stones !</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="19">
      <l n="195">And the King said , “ Haw ! ” and the Queen said , “ Oh !</l>
      <l n="196">Our drawing-room now is a heavenly show</l>

      <l n="199">But a Glug stood up with a cast in his eye ,</l>
      <l n="200">And he said , “ Far too many baubles we buy ;</l>
      <l n="201">With all the Gosh factories closing their doors ,</l>
      <l n="202">And importers ’ warehouses lining our shores . ”</l>
      <l n="203">But the Glugs cried , “ Down with such meddlesome fools !</l>
      <l n="204">What did our grandpas lay down in their rules ? ”</l>
      <l n="205">And the Knight , Sir Stodge , he opened his Book :</l>
      <l n="206">“ To Cheapness , ” he said , “ was the road they took . ”</l>
      <l n="207">Then every Glug who was not too fat</l>
      <l n="208">Turned seventeen handsprings , and jumped on his hat .</l>
      <l n="209">They fined the Glug with the cast in his eye</l>
      <l n="210">For looking both ways — which he did not deny —</l>
      <l n="211">And for having no visible precedent , which</l>

     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="20">
      <l n="213">So the Glugs continued , with greed and glee ,</l>

      <l n="215">Till every Glug in the land of Gosh</l>
      <l n="216">Owned three clean shirts and a fourth in the wash .</l>
      <l n="217">But they all grew idle , and fond of ease ,</l>
      <l n="218">And easy to swindle , and hard to please ;</l>
      <l n="219">And the voice of Joi was a lonely voice ,</l>
      <l n="220">When he railed at Gosh for its foolish choice .</l>
      <l n="221">But the great King grinned , and the good Queen gushed ,</l>
      <l n="222">As the goods of the Ogs were madly rushed .</l>
      <l n="223">And the Knight , Sir Stodge , with a wave of his hand ,</l>

      <l n="345">But the warlike Ogs , they hurled great rocks</l>

      <l n="359">And bottles of pickles , and clocks they threw ,</l>
      <l n="360">And books of poems , and gherkins , and glue ,</l>
      <l n="361">Which they 'd bought with the stones — as , of course , you know —</l>
      <l n="362">From the Ogs but a couple of months ago .</l>
      <l n="363">Which was simply inane , when you reason it o'er ;</l>

     <lg type="stanza" n="55">
      <l n="365">When they 'd fought for a night and the most of a day ,</l>

      <l n="367">Then they went back to Podge , well content with their fun ,</l>
      <l n="368">And , with much satisfaction , declared they had won .</l>
      <l n="369">And the King of the Glugs gazed around on his land ,</l>
      <l n="370">And saw nothing but stones strewn on every hand :</l>
      <l n="371">Great stones in the palace , and stones in the street ,</l>
      <l n="372">And stones on the house-tops and under the feet .</l>
      <l n="373">And he said , with a desperate look on his face ,</l>
      <l n="374">“ There is nothing so ghastly as stones out of place .</l>
      <l n="375">And , no doubt , this Og scheme was a very smart dodge .</l>

      <l n="577">And he sings quite a lot , as the Summer days pass ,</l>
      <l n="578">With his back to a tree and his feet in the grass .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="87">
      <l n="579">And the little red dog , who is wise as dogs go ,</l>
      <l n="580">He will hark to that song for a minute or so ,</l>
      <l n="581">‘ With his head on one side , and a serious air .</l>
      <l n="582">Then he makes no remark ; but he wanders elsewhere .</l>
      <l n="583">And he trots down the garden to gaze now and then</l>
      <l n="584">At the curious pranks of a certain blue wren :</l>
      <l n="585">Not a commonplace wren , but a bird marked for fame</l>
      <l n="586">Thro ’ a grievance in life and a definite aim .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="88">
      <l n="587">Now , they never fly far and they never fly high ,</l>
      <l n="588">And they probably could n't , suppose they should try .</l>
      <l n="589">So the common blue wren is content with his lot :</l>
      <l n="590">He will eat when there 's food , and he fasts when there 's not .</l>
      <l n="591">He flirts and he flutters , his wife by his side ,</l>
      <l n="592">With his share of content and forgiveable pride .</l>
      <l n="593">And he keeps to the earth , ‘ mid the bushes and shrubs ,</l>
      <l n="594">And he dines very well upon corpulent grubs .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="89">
      <l n="595">But the little blue wren with a grievance in life ,</l>
      <l n="596">He was rude to his neighbours and short with his wife .</l>
      <l n="597">For , up in the apple-tree over his nest ,</l>
      <l n="598">There dwelt a fat spider who gave him no rest :</l>
      <l n="599">A spider so fat , so abnormally stout</l>
      <l n="600">That he seemed hardly fitted to waddle about .</l>
      <l n="601">But his eyes were so sharp , and his legs were so spry ,</l>
      <l n="602">That he could not be caught ; and ‘ twas folly to try .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="90">
      <l n="603">Said the wren , as his loud lamentations he hurled</l>
      <l n="604">At the little red dog , “ It 's a rotten old world !</l>
      <l n="605">But my heart would be glad , and my life would be blest</l>
      <l n="606">If I had that fat spider well under my vest .</l>
      <l n="607">Then I 'd call back my youth , and be seeking to live ,</l>
      <l n="608">And to taste of the pleasures the world has to give .</l>
      <l n="609">But the world is all wrong , and my mind 's in a fog ! ”</l>
      <l n="610">“ Aw , do n't be a Glug ! ” said the little red dog .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="91">
      <l n="611">Then , up from the grass , where he sat by his tree ,</l>
      <l n="612">The voice of the Tinker rose fearless and free .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="92">
      <l n="613">The little dog listened , his head on one side ;</l>
      <l n="614">Then sought him a spot where a bored dog could hide .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="93">
      <l n="615">“ Kettles and pans ! Ho , kettles and pans !</l>
      <l n="616">The stars are the gods ’ but the earth , it is man 's !</l>
      <l n="617">Yet down in the shadow dull mortals there are</l>
      <l n="618">Who climb in the tree-tops to snatch at a star :</l>
      <l n="619">Seeking content and a surcease of care ,</l>
      <l n="620">Finding but emptiness everywhere .</l>
      <l n="621">Then make for the mountain , importunate man !</l>
      <l n="622">With a kettle to mend . . . and your Emily Ann .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="94">
      <l n="623">As he cocked a sad eye o'er a sheltering log ,</l>
      <l n="624">“ Oh , a Glug is a Glug ! ” sighed the little red dog .</l>
