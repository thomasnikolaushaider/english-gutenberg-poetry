     <p>Helen of Troy</p>
     <lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">Wild flight on flight against the fading dawn</l>
       <l n="2">The flames ’ red wings soar upward duskily .</l>
       <l n="3">This is the funeral pyre and Troy is dead</l>
       <l n="4">That sparkled so the day I saw it first ,</l>
       <l n="5">And darkened slowly after . I am she</l>
       <l n="6">Who loves all beauty — yet I wither it .</l>
       <l n="7">Why have the high gods made me wreak their wrath —</l>
       <l n="8">Forever since my maidenhood to sow</l>
       <l n="9">Sorrow and blood about me ? Lo , they keep</l>
       <l n="10">Their bitter care above me even now .</l>
       <l n="11">It was the gods who led me to this lair ,</l>
       <l n="12">That tho ’ the burning winds should make me weak ,</l>
       <l n="13">They should not snatch the life from out my lips .</l>
       <l n="14">Olympus let the other women die ;</l>
       <l n="15">They shall be quiet when the day is done</l>
       <l n="16">And have no care to-morrow . Yet for me</l>
       <l n="17">There is no rest . The gods are not so kind</l>
       <l n="18">To her made half immortal like themselves .</l>
       <l n="19">It is to you I owe the cruel gift ,</l>
       <l n="20">Leda , my mother , and the Swan , my sire ,</l>
       <l n="21">To you the beauty and to you the bale ;</l>
       <l n="22">For never woman born of man and maid</l>
       <l n="23">Had wrought such havoc on the earth as I ,</l>
       <l n="24">Or troubled heaven with a sea of flame</l>
       <l n="25">That climbed to touch the silent whirling stars</l>
       <l n="26">And blotted out their brightness ere the dawn .</l>
       <l n="27">Have I not made the world to weep enough ?</l>
       <l n="28">Give death to me . Yet life is more than death ;</l>
       <l n="29">How could I leave the sound of singing winds ,</l>
       <l n="30">The strong sweet scent that breathes from off the sea ,</l>
       <l n="31">Or shut my eyes forever to the spring ?</l>
       <l n="32">I will not give the grave my hands to hold ,</l>
       <l n="33">My shining hair to light oblivion .</l>
       <l n="34">Have those who wander through the ways of death ,</l>
       <l n="35">The still wan fields Elysian , any love</l>
       <l n="36">To lift their breasts with longing , any lips</l>
       <l n="37">To thirst against the quiver of a kiss ?</l>
       <l n="38">Lo , I shall live to conquer Greece again ,</l>
       <l n="39">To make the people love , who hate me now .</l>
       <l n="40">My dreams are over , I have ceased to cry</l>
       <l n="41">Against the fate that made men love my mouth</l>
       <l n="42">And left their spirits all too deaf to hear</l>
       <l n="43">The little songs that echoed through my soul .</l>
       <l n="44">I have no anger now . The dreams are done ;</l>
       <l n="45">Yet since the Greeks and Trojans would not see</l>
       <l n="46">Aught but my body 's fairness , till the end ,</l>
       <l n="47">In all the islands set in all the seas ,</l>
       <l n="48">And all the lands that lie beneath the sun ,</l>
       <l n="49">Till light turn darkness , and till time shall sleep ,</l>
       <l n="50">Men 's lives shall waste with longing after me ,</l>
       <l n="51">For I shall be the sum of their desire ,</l>
       <l n="52">The whole of beauty , never seen again .</l>
       <l n="53">And they shall stretch their arms and starting , wake</l>
       <l n="54">With “ Helen ! ” on their lips , and in their eyes</l>
       <l n="55">The vision of me . Always I shall be</l>
       <l n="56">Limned on the darkness like a shaft of light</l>
       <l n="57">That glimmers and is gone . They shall behold</l>
       <l n="58">Each one his dream that fashions me anew ;—</l>
       <l n="59">With hair like lakes that glint beneath the stars</l>
       <l n="60">Dark as sweet midnight , or with hair aglow</l>
       <l n="61">Like burnished gold that still retains the fire .</l>
       <l n="62">Yea , I shall haunt until the dusk of time</l>
       <l n="63">The heavy eyelids filled with fleeting dreams .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="64">I wait for one who comes with sword to slay —</l>
       <l n="65">The king I wronged who searches for me now ;</l>
       <l n="66">And yet he shall not slay me . I shall stand</l>
       <l n="67">With lifted head and look within his eyes ,</l>
       <l n="68">Baring my breast to him and to the sun .</l>
       <l n="69">He shall not have the power to stain with blood</l>
       <l n="70">That whiteness — for the thirsty sword shall fall</l>
       <l n="71">And he shall cry and catch me in his arms ,</l>
       <l n="72">Bearing me back to Sparta on his breast .</l>
       <l n="73">Lo , I shall live to conquer Greece again !</l>

       <l n="2">Send out the singers — let the room be still ;</l>
       <l n="3">They have not eased my pain nor brought me sleep .</l>
       <l n="4">Close out the sun , for I would have it dark</l>
       <l n="5">That I may feel how black the grave will be .</l>
       <l n="6">The sun is setting , for the light is red ,</l>
       <l n="7">And you are outlined in a golden fire ,</l>
       <l n="8">Like Ursula upon an altar-screen .</l>
       <l n="9">Come , leave the light and sit beside my bed ,</l>
       <l n="10">For I have had enough of saints and prayers .</l>
       <l n="11">Strange broken thoughts are beating in my brain ,</l>
       <l n="12">They come and vanish and again they come .</l>
       <l n="13">It is the fever driving out my soul ,</l>
       <l n="14">And Death stands waiting by the arras there .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="15">Ornella , I will speak , for soon my lips</l>
       <l n="16">Shall keep a silence till the end of time .</l>
       <l n="17">You have a mouth for loving — listen then :</l>
       <l n="18">Keep tryst with Love before Death comes to tryst ;</l>
       <l n="19">For I , who die , could wish that I had lived</l>
       <l n="20">A little closer to the world of men ,</l>
       <l n="21">Not watching always thro ’ the blazoned panes</l>
       <l n="22">That show the world in chilly greens and blues</l>
       <l n="23">And grudge the sunshine that would enter in .</l>
       <l n="24">I was no part of all the troubled crowd</l>
       <l n="25">That moved beneath the palace windows here ,</l>
       <l n="26">And yet sometimes a knight in shining steel</l>
       <l n="27">Would pass and catch the gleaming of my hair ,</l>
       <l n="28">And wave a mailed hand and smile at me ,</l>
       <l n="29">Whereat I made no sign and turned away ,</l>
       <l n="30">Affrighted and yet glad and full of dreams .</l>
       <l n="31">Ah , dreams and dreams that asked no answering !</l>
       <l n="32">I should have wrought to make my dreams come true ,</l>
       <l n="33">But all my life was like an autumn day ,</l>
       <l n="34">Full of gray quiet and a hazy peace .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="35">What was I saying ? All is gone again .</l>
       <l n="36">It seemed but now I was the little child</l>
       <l n="37">Who played within a garden long ago .</l>
       <l n="38">Beyond the walls the festal trumpets blared .</l>
       <l n="39">Perhaps they carried some Madonna by</l>
       <l n="40">With tossing ensigns in a sea of flowers ,</l>
       <l n="41">A painted Virgin with a painted Child ,</l>
       <l n="42">Who saw for once the sweetness of the sun</l>
       <l n="43">Before they shut her in an altar-niche</l>
       <l n="44">Where tapers smoke against the windy gloom .</l>
       <l n="45">I gathered roses redder than my gown</l>
       <l n="46">And played that I was Saint Elizabeth ,</l>
       <l n="47">Whose wine had turned to roses in her hands .</l>
       <l n="48">And as I played , a child came thro ’ the gate ,</l>
       <l n="49">A boy who looked at me without a word ,</l>
       <l n="50">As tho ’ he saw stretch far behind my head</l>
       <l n="51">Long lines of radiant angels , row on row .</l>
       <l n="52">That day we spoke a little , timidly ,</l>
       <l n="53">And after that I never heard the voice</l>
       <l n="54">That sang so many songs for love of me .</l>
       <l n="55">He was content to stand and watch me pass ,</l>
       <l n="56">To seek for me at matins every day ,</l>
       <l n="57">Where I could feel his eyes the while I prayed .</l>
       <l n="58">I think if he had stretched his hands to me ,</l>
       <l n="59">Or moved his lips to say a single word ,</l>
       <l n="60">I might have loved him — he had wondrous eyes .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="61">Ornella , are you there ? I cannot see —</l>
       <l n="62">Is every one so lonely when he dies ?</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="63">The room is filled with lights — with waving lights —</l>
       <l n="64">Who are the men and women ‘ round the bed ?</l>
       <l n="65">What have I said , Ornella ? Have they heard ?</l>
       <l n="66">There was no evil hidden in my life ,</l>
       <l n="67">And yet , and yet , I would not have them know —</l>

      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="2">The twilight 's inner flame grows blue and deep ,</l>
       <l n="3">And in my Lesbos , over leagues of sea ,</l>
       <l n="4">The temples glimmer moonwise in the trees .</l>
       <l n="5">Twilight has veiled the little flower face</l>
       <l n="6">Here on my heart , but still the night is kind</l>
       <l n="7">And leaves her warm sweet weight against my breast .</l>
       <l n="8">Am I that Sappho who would run at dusk</l>
       <l n="9">Along the surges creeping up the shore</l>
       <l n="10">When tides came in to ease the hungry beach ,</l>
       <l n="11">And running , running , till the night was black ,</l>
       <l n="12">Would fall forespent upon the chilly sand</l>
       <l n="13">And quiver with the winds from off the sea ?</l>
       <l n="14">Ah , quietly the shingle waits the tides</l>
       <l n="15">Whose waves are stinging kisses , but to me</l>
       <l n="16">Love brought no peace , nor darkness any rest .</l>
       <l n="17">I crept and touched the foam with fevered hands</l>
       <l n="18">And cried to Love , from whom the sea is sweet ,</l>
       <l n="19">From whom the sea is bitterer than death .</l>
       <l n="20">Ah , Aphrodite , if I sing no more</l>
       <l n="21">To thee , God 's daughter , powerful as God ,</l>
       <l n="22">It is that thou hast made my life too sweet</l>
       <l n="23">To hold the added sweetness of a song .</l>
       <l n="24">There is a quiet at the heart of love ,</l>
       <l n="25">And I have pierced the pain and come to peace .</l>
       <l n="26">I hold my peace , my Cleis , on my heart ;</l>
       <l n="27">And softer than a little wild bird 's wing</l>
       <l n="28">Are kisses that she pours upon my mouth .</l>
       <l n="29">Ah , never any more when spring like fire</l>
       <l n="30">Will flicker in the newly opened leaves ,</l>
       <l n="31">Shall I steal forth to seek for solitude</l>
       <l n="32">Beyond the lure of light Alcaeus ’ lyre ,</l>
       <l n="33">Beyond the sob that stilled Erinna 's voice .</l>
       <l n="34">Ah , never with a throat that aches with song ,</l>
       <l n="35">Beneath the white uncaring sky of spring ,</l>
       <l n="36">Shall I go forth to hide awhile from Love</l>
       <l n="37">The quiver and the crying of my heart .</l>
       <l n="38">Still I remember how I strove to flee</l>
       <l n="39">The love-note of the birds , and bowed my head</l>
       <l n="40">To hurry faster , but upon the ground</l>
       <l n="41">I saw two winged shadows side by side ,</l>
       <l n="42">And all the world 's spring passion stifled me .</l>
       <l n="43">Ah , Love , there is no fleeing from thy might ,</l>
       <l n="44">No lonely place where thou hast never trod ,</l>
       <l n="45">No desert thou hast left uncarpeted</l>
       <l n="46">With flowers that spring beneath thy perfect feet .</l>
       <l n="47">In many guises didst thou come to me ;</l>
       <l n="48">I saw thee by the maidens while they danced ,</l>
       <l n="49">Phaon allured me with a look of thine ,</l>
       <l n="50">In Anactoria I knew thy grace ,</l>
       <l n="51">I looked at Cercolas and saw thine eyes ;</l>
       <l n="52">But never wholly , soul and body mine ,</l>
       <l n="53">Didst thou bid any love me as I loved .</l>
       <l n="54">Now I have found the peace that fled from me ;</l>
       <l n="55">Close , close , against my heart I hold my world .</l>
       <l n="56">Ah , Love that made my life a lyric cry ,</l>
       <l n="57">Ah , Love that tuned my lips to lyres of thine ,</l>
       <l n="58">I taught the world thy music , now alone</l>
       <l n="59">I sing for one who falls asleep to hear .</l>

       <l n="18">I thought she might be kinder than the rest ,</l>
       <l n="19">And so I came to kneel before her feet ,</l>
       <l n="20">Sick with love 's sorrow and love 's bitterness .</l>
       <l n="21">But when I would have made the blessed sign ,</l>
       <l n="22">I found the water frozen in the font ,</l>
       <l n="23">And touched but ice within the carved stone .</l>
       <l n="24">The saints had hid themselves away from me ,</l>
       <l n="25">Leaving the windows black against the night ;</l>
       <l n="26">And when I sank upon the altar steps ,</l>
       <l n="27">Before the Virgin Mother and her Child ,</l>
       <l n="28">The last , pale , low-burnt taper flickered out ,</l>
       <l n="29">But in the darkness , smooth and fathomless ,</l>
       <l n="30">Still twinkled like a star the holy lamp</l>
       <l n="31">That cast a dusky glow upon her face .</l>
       <l n="32">Then through the numbing cold peace fell on me ,</l>
       <l n="33">Submission and the gracious gift of tears ,</l>
       <l n="34">For when I looked , Oh ! blessed miracle ,</l>
       <l n="35">Her lips had parted and Our Lady smiled !</l>
       <l n="36">And then I knew that Love is worth its pain</l>
       <l n="37">And that my heart was richer for his sake ,</l>
       <l n="38">Since lack of love is bitterest of all .</l>

       <l n="39">The day is broad awake — the first long beam</l>

       <l n="41">And trembling there it lights a timid smile</l>
       <l n="42">Upon the lips that say so many prayers ,</l>
       <l n="43">And have no words for hate and none for love .</l>
       <l n="44">But when she passes where her prayers have gone ,</l>

       <l n="56">One thought forever , sleeping or awake ;</l>
       <l n="57">To say one name whose sweetness grows so strange</l>
       <l n="58">That it might work a spell on those who weep ;</l>

       <l n="60">So heavy that the blood can scarcely flow .</l>
       <l n="61">Love comes to some unlooked-for , quietly ,</l>

       <l n="65">A cold and placid gleam that wavers not ,</l>
       <l n="66">And there are those who wait the call of love</l>
       <l n="67">Expectant of his coming , as we watch</l>
       <l n="68">To see the east grow pallid ere the moon</l>
       <l n="69">Lifts up her flower-like head against the night .</l>
       <l n="70">Love came to me as comes a cruel sun ,</l>
       <l n="71">That on some rain-drenched morning , when the leaves</l>
       <l n="72">Are bowed beneath their clinging weight of drops ,</l>
       <l n="73">Tears through the mist , and burns with fervent heat</l>
       <l n="74">The tender grasses and the meadow flowers ;</l>
       <l n="75">Then suddenly the heavy clouds close in</l>
       <l n="76">And through the dark the thunder 's muttering</l>
       <l n="77">Is drowned amid the dashing of the rain .</l>

       <l n="35">What if , to-night , I should revisit them ?</l>
       <l n="36">The warders at the gates , the kitchen-maids ,</l>
       <l n="37">The very beggars would stand off from me ,</l>

       <l n="34">I thought I saw him stand , the man I love ,</l>
       <l n="35">Here in my quiet chamber , with his eyes</l>
       <l n="36">Fixed on me as I entered , while he drew</l>

       <l n="38">Goes by my door without a thought of me —</l>
       <l n="39">Neared me and put his hand behind my head ,</l>
       <l n="40">And leaning toward me , kissed me on the mouth .</l>

     <p>L. But you have been an enemy , my lord , With walls between us and with moss-grown moats , Now on a sudden must I kiss your mouth ?

     <p>K. Why came we here in all the noon-day light With only darting swallows over us To make a speck of darkness on the sun ? Let us go down where walls will shut us round . Your castle has a hundred quiet halls , A hundred chambers , where the shadows lie On things put by , forgotten long ago . Forgotten lutes with strings that Time has slackened , We two shall draw them close and bid them sing — Forgotten games , forgotten books still open Where you had laid them by at vesper-time , And your embroidery , whereon half-worked Weeps Amor wounded by a rose 's thorn . Shall I not see the room in which you slept , Palpitant still and breathing of your thoughts , Where maiden dreams adown the ways of sleep Swept noiselessly with damosels and knights To tourneys where the trumpet made no sound , Blow as he might , the scarlet trumpeter , And were the dreams not sometimes brimmed with tears That waked you when the night was loneliest ? Will you not bring me to your oratory Where prayers arose like little birds set free Still upward , upward without sound of flight ? Shall I not find your turrets toward the north , Where you defied white winter armed for war ; Your southern casements where the sun blows in Between the leaf-bent boughs the wind has lifted ? Shall we not see the sunrise toward the east , Watch dawn by dawn the rose of day unfolding Its golden-hearted beauty sovereignly ; And toward the west look quietly at evening ? Shall I not see all these and all your treasures ? In carven coffers hidden in the dark Have you not laid a sapphire lit with flame And amethysts set round with deep-wrought gold , Perhaps a ruby ?</p>
     <p>L. All my gems are yours And all my chambers curtained from the sun . My lord shall see them all , in time , in time .</p>
     <p>( The sun begins to sink . )</p>
     <p>K. Shall I not see them now ? To-day , to-night ?</p>
     <p>L. How could I show you in one day , my lord , My castle and my treasures and my tower ? Let all the days to come suffice for this Since all the past days made them what they are . You will not be impatient , my sweet lord . Some of the halls have long been locked and barred , And some have secret doors and hard to find Till suddenly you touch them unawares , And down a sable way runs silver light . We two will search together for the keys , But not to-day . Let us sit here to-day , Since all is yours and always will be yours .</p>
     <p>( The stars appear faintly one by one . )</p>
