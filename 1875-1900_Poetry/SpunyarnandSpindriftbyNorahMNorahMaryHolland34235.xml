     <head>THE LITTLE DOG-ANGEL</head>

      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="2">High up in the courts of Heaven to-day</l>
       <l n="3">A little dog-angel waits ,</l>
       <l n="4">With the other angels he will not play ,</l>
       <l n="5">But he sits alone at the gates ;</l>
       <l n="6">“ For I know that my master will come , ” says he :</l>
       <l n="7">“ And when he comes , he will call for me . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="8">He sees the spirits that pass him by</l>
       <l n="9">As they hasten towards the throne ,</l>
       <l n="10">And he watches them with a wistful eye</l>
       <l n="11">As he sits at the gates alone ;</l>
       <l n="12">“ But I know if I just wait patiently</l>
       <l n="13">That some day my master will come , ” says he .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="14">And his master , far on the earth below ,</l>
       <l n="15">As he sits in his easy chair ,</l>
       <l n="16">Forgets sometimes , and he whistles low</l>
       <l n="17">For the dog that is not there ;</l>
       <l n="18">And the little dog-angel cocks his ears ,</l>
       <l n="19">And dreams that his master 's call he hears .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="20">And I know , when at length his master waits</l>
       <l n="21">Outside in the dark and cold</l>
       <l n="22">For the hand of Death to ope the gates</l>
       <l n="23">That lead to those courts of gold ,</l>
       <l n="24">The little dog-angel 's eager bark</l>
       <l n="25">Will comfort his soul in the shivering dark .</l>

      <head>A SONG OF ERIN</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">Far to westward in the sunset tall and bare her cliffs arise ,</l>
       <l n="2">Mother Erin , with the tender love and laughter in her eyes ,</l>
       <l n="3">Looking out across the waters , dreaming of her argosies .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="4">Argosies that sail forever , laden down with hopes and fears ,</l>
       <l n="5">Ships of dream , returning never , though she waits throughout the years ,</l>
       <l n="6">Waits , with eyes wherein the laughter grows more sorrowful than tears .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="7">One by one her children leave her — stalwart sons and daughters fair ,</l>
       <l n="8">Straining eyes grown dim with anguish as her hilltops melt in air ;</l>
       <l n="9">Bending from her cliffs she watches , drinking deep of their despair .</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>Yet she showers her gifts upon them — gifts of laughter and of tears ; Gives their eyes the Vision Splendid , fairy music to their ears , Weaves around their feet her magic — spells that strengthen through the years ,</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">So her children , unforgetting , howsoe'er their footsteps roam ,</l>
       <l n="2">Turn their hearts forever westward , longing for the day to come</l>
       <l n="3">When once more they see her stooping from her heights to call them home .</l>

       <l n="15">And very still she rested , clasped close in his embrace ,</l>
       <l n="16">The King of Erin 's daughter , for the bridegroom 's name was Death .</l>

     <p>I will go down to my sea again — to the waste of waters , wild and wide ; I am tired — so tired — of hill and plain and the dull tame face of the country side .</p>
     <p>I will go out across the bar , with a swoop like the flight of a sea-bird 's wings , To where the winds and the waters are , with their multitudinous thunderings .</p>
     <p>My prows shall furrow the whitening sea , out into the teeth of the lashing wind , Where a thousand billows snarl and flee and break in a smother of foam behind .</p>
     <p>O strong and terrible Mother Sea , let me lie once more on your cool white breast , Your winds have blown through the heart of me and called me back from the land 's dull rest .</p>
     <p>For night by night they blow through my sleep ; the voice of waves through my slumber rings ; I feel the spell of the steadfast deep ; I hear its tramplings and triumphings .</p>
     <p>And at last , when my hours of life are sped , let them make me no grave by hill or plain — Thy waves , O Mother , shall guard my head . I will go down to my sea again .</p>
