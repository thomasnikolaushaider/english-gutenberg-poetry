     <head>SUB TERRA</head>
     <p>Where shall I find you , you my grotesque fellows that I seek everywhere to make up my band ? None , not one with the earthy tastes I require ; the burrowing pride that rises subtly as on a bush in May .</p>
     <p>Where are you this day , you my seven year locusts with cased wings ? Ah my beauties how I long —! That harvest that shall be your advent — thrusting up through the grass , up under the weeds answering me , that shall be satisfying ! The light shall leap and snap that day as with a million lashes !</p>
     <p>Oh , I have you ; yes you are about me in a sense : playing under the blue pools that are my windows ,— but they shut you out still , there in the half light .</p>
     <p>For the simple truth is that though I see you clear enough you are not there !</p>
     <p>It is not that — it is you , you I want !</p>
     <p>— God , if I could fathom the guts of shadows !</p>
     <p>You to come with me poking into negro houses with their gloom and smell ! In among children leaping around a dead dog ! Mimicking onto the lawns of the rich ! You ! to go with me a-tip-toe , head down under heaven , nostrils lipping the wind !</p>

     <head>PASTORAL</head>
     <p>When I was younger it was plain to me I must make something of myself . Older now I walk back streets admiring the houses of the very poor : roof out of line with sides the yards cluttered with old chicken wire , ashes , furniture gone wrong ; the fences and outhouses built of barrel-staves and parts of boxes , all , if I am fortunate , smeared a bluish green that properly weathered pleases me best of all colors .</p>
     <p>No one will believe this of vast import to the nation .</p>

     <head>CHICKORY AND DAISIES</head>
      <head>I .</head>
     <p>Lift your flowers on bitter stems chickory ! Lift them up out of the scorched ground ! Bear no foliage but give yourself wholly to that !</p>
     <p>Strain under them you bitter stems that no beast eats — and scorn greyness ! Into the heat with them : cool ! luxuriant ! sky-blue ! The earth cracks and is shriveled up ; the wind moans piteously ; the sky goes out if you should fail .</p>
      <p>II .</p>
     <p>I saw a child with daisies for weaving into the hair tear the stems with her teeth !</p>

     <head>WOMAN WALKING</head>
     <p>An oblique cloud of purple smoke across a milky silhouette of house sides and tiny trees — a little village — that ends in a saw edge of mist-covered trees on a sheet of grey sky .</p>
     <p>To the right , jutting in , a dark crimson corner of roof . To the left , half a tree :</p>
     <p>— what a blessing it is to see you in the street again , powerful woman , coming with swinging haunches , breasts straight forward , supple shoulders , full arms and strong , soft hands ( I ’ ve felt them ) carrying the heavy basket . I might well see you oftener ! And for a different reason than the fresh eggs you bring us so regularly .</p>
     <p>Yes , you , young as I , with boney brows , kind grey eyes and a kind mouth ; you walking out toward me from that dead hillside ! I might well see you oftener .</p>

     <head>GULLS</head>
     <p>My townspeople , beyond in the great world , are many with whom it were far more profitable for me to live than here with you . These whirr about me calling , calling ! and for my own part I answer them , loud as I can , but they , being free , pass ! I remain ! Therefore , listen ! For you will not soon have another singer .</p>
     <p>First I say this : you have seen the strange birds , have you not , that sometimes rest upon our river in winter ?</p>
     <p>Let them cause you to think well then of the storms that drive many to shelter . These things do not happen without reason .</p>
     <p>And the next thing I say is this : I saw an eagle once circling against the clouds over one of our principal churches — Easter , it was — a beautiful day !—: three gulls came from above the river and crossed slowly seaward ! Oh , I know you have your own hymns , I have heard them — and because I knew they invoked some great protector I could not be angry with you , no matter how much they outraged true music —</p>
     <p>You see , it is not necessary for us to leap at each other , and , as I told you , in the end the gulls moved seaward very quietly .</p>

      <head>APPEAL</head>
      <head>You who are so mighty , crimson salamander , hear me once more .</head>
      <head>I lay among the half burned sticks at the edge of the fire . The fiend was creeping in . I felt the cold tips of fingers —</head>
       <l n="1">O crimson salamander !</l>
     </lg>
     <p>Give me one little flame , one ! that I may bind it protectingly about the wrist of him that flung me here , here upon the very center !</p>
     <p>This is my song .</p>

      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">Surely there , among the great docks , is peace , my mind ;</l>
       <l n="2">there with the ships moored in the river .</l>
       <l n="3">Go out , timid child ,</l>
       <l n="4">and snuggle in among the great ships talking so quietly .</l>
       <l n="5">Maybe you will even fall asleep near them and be</l>
       <l n="6">lifted into one of their laps , and in the morning —</l>
       <l n="7">There is always the morning in which to remember it all !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="8">Of what are they gossiping ? God knows .</l>
       <l n="9">And God knows it matters little for we cannot understand them .</l>
       <l n="10">Yet it is certainly of the sea , of that there can be no question .</l>
       <l n="11">It is a quiet sound . Rest ! That ’ s all I care for now .</l>
       <l n="12">The smell of them will put us to sleep presently .</l>
       <l n="13">Smell ! It is the sea water mingling here into the river —</l>
       <l n="14">at least so it seems — perhaps it is something else — but what matter ?</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>The sea water ! It is quiet and smooth here ! How slowly they move , little by little trying the hawsers that drop and groan with their agony . Yes , it is certainly of the high sea they are talking .</p>

     <head>WINTER SUNSET</head>
     <p>Then I raised my head and stared out over the blue February waste to the blue bank of hill with stars on it in strings and festoons — but above that : one opaque stone of a cloud just on the hill left and right as far as I could see ; and above that a red streak , then icy blue sky !</p>
     <p>It was a fearful thing to come into a man ’ s heart at that time : that stone over the little blinking stars they ’ d set there .</p>

       <l n="1">Why do I write today ?</l>
     </lg>
     <p>The beauty of the terrible faces of our nonentities stirs me to it :</p>
     <p>colored women day workers — old and experienced — returning home at dusk in cast off clothing faces like old Florentine oak .</p>
     <p>Also</p>
     <p>the set pieces of your faces stir me — leading citizens — but not in the same way .</p>

     <head>PASTORAL</head>
     <p>The little sparrows hop ingenuously about the pavement quarreling with sharp voices over those things that interest them . But we who are wiser shut ourselves in on either hand and no one knows whether we think good or evil . Meanwhile , the old man who goes about gathering dog-lime walks in the gutter without looking up and his tread is more majestic than that of the Episcopal minister approaching the pulpit of a Sunday . These things astonish me beyond words .</p>

     <head>LOVE SONG</head>
     <p>Daisies are broken petals are news of the day stems lift to the grass tops they catch on shoes part in the middle leave root and leaves secure .</p>
     <p>Black branches carry square leaves to the wood ’ s top . They hold firm break with a roar show the white !</p>
     <p>Your moods are slow the shedding of leaves and sure the return in May !</p>
     <p>We walked in your father ’ s grove and saw the great oaks lying with roots ripped from the ground .</p>

     <head>M. B .</head>
     <p>Winter has spent this snow out of envy , but spring is here ! He sits at the breakfast table in his yellow hair and disdains even the sun walking outside in spangled slippers :</p>
     <p>He looks out : there is a glare of lights before a theater ,— a sparkling lady passes quickly to the seclusion of her carriage . Presently under the dirty , wavy heaven of a borrowed room he will make re-inhaled tobacco smoke his clouds and try them against the sky ’ s limits !</p>

     <head>TRACT</head>
     <p>I will teach you my townspeople how to perform a funeral — for you have it over a troop of artists — unless one should scour the world — you have the ground sense necessary .</p>
     <p>See ! the hearse leads . I begin with a design for a hearse . For Christ ’ s sake not black — nor white either — and not polished ! Let it be weathered — like a farm wagon — with gilt wheels ( this could be applied fresh at small expense ) or no wheels at all : a rough dray to drag over the ground .</p>
     <p>Knock the glass out ! My God — glass , my townspeople ! For what purpose ? Is it for the dead to look out or for us to see how well he is housed or to see the flowers or the lack of them — or what ? To keep the rain and snow from him ? He will have a heavier rain soon : pebbles and dirt and what not . Let there be no glass — and no upholstery phew ! and no little brass rollers and small easy wheels on the bottom — my townspeople what are you thinking of ?</p>
     <p>A rough plain hearse then with gilt wheels and no top at all . On this the coffin lies by its own weight .</p>
     <p>No wreathes please — especially no hot house flowers . Some common memento is better , something he prized and is known by : his old clothes — a few books perhaps — God knows what ! You realize how we are about these things my townspeople — something will be found — anything even flowers if he had come to that .</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">So much for the hearse .</l>
       <l n="2">For heaven ’ s sake though see to the driver !</l>
     </lg>
     <p>Take off the silk hat ! In fact that ’ s no place at all for him — up there unceremoniously dragging our friend out to his own dignity ! Bring him down — bring him down ! Low and inconspicuous ! I ’ d not have him ride on the wagon at all — damn him — the undertaker ’ s understrapper ! Let him hold the reins and walk at the side and inconspicuously too !</p>
     <p>Then briefly as to yourselves : Walk behind — as they do in France , seventh class , or if you ride Hell take curtains ! Go with some show of inconvenience ; sit openly — to the weather as to grief . Or do you think you can shut grief in ? What — from us ? We who have perhaps nothing to lose ? Share with us share with us — it will be money in your pockets .</p>

      <head>Well , mind , here we have our little son beside us : a little diversion before breakfast !</head>

     <p>Splash the water up ! ( Splash it up , Sonny ! ) Laugh ! Hit it there deep under the grass .</p>
     <p>See it splash ! Ah , mind , see it splash ! It is alive ! Throw pieces of broken leaves into it . They ’ ll pass through . No ! Yes — just !</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">Away now for the cows ! But —</l>
       <l n="2">It ’ s cold !</l>

     <p>III .</p>
     <p>Oh then , a wreath ! Let ’ s refresh something they used to write well of .</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">Two fern plumes . Strip them</l>
       <l n="2">to the mid-rib along one side .</l>
       <l n="3">Bind the tips with a grass stem .</l>
       <l n="4">Bend and intertwist the stalks</l>
       <l n="5">at the back . So !</l>
       <l n="6">Ah ! now we are crowned !</l>
       <l n="7">Now we are a poet !</l>
     </lg>
     <p>Quickly ! A bunch of little flowers for Flossie — the little ones only : a red clover , one blue heal-all , a sprig of bone-set , one primrose , a head of Indian tobacco , this magenta speck and this little lavender ! Home now , my mind !— Sonny ’ s arms are icy , I tell you — and have breakfast !</p>

     <p>Well — all things turn bitter in the end whether you choose the right or the left way and — dreams are not a bad thing .</p>

     <p>The old black-man showed me how he had been shocked in his youth by six women , dancing a set-dance , stark naked below the skirts raised round their breasts : bellies flung forward knees flying ! — while his gestures , against the tiled wall of the dingy bath-room , swished with ecstasy to the familiar music of his old emotion .</p>

     <p>Wanderer moon smiling a faintly ironical smile at this brilliant , dew-moistened summer morning ,— a detached sleepily indifferent smile , a wanderer ’ s smile ,— if I should buy a shirt your color and put on a necktie sky blue where would they carry me ?</p>

     <p>Artsybashev is a Russian . I am an American . Let us wonder , my townspeople , if Artsybashev tends his own fires as I do , gets himself cursed for the baby ’ s failure to thrive , loosens windows for the woman who cleans his parlor — or has he neat servants and a quiet library , an intellectual wife perhaps and no children ,— an apartment somewhere in a back street or lives alone or with his mother or sister —</p>
     <p>I wonder , my townspeople , if Artsybashev looks upon himself the more concernedly or succeeds any better than I in laying the world .</p>
     <p>I wonder which is the bigger fool in his own mind .</p>
     <p>These are shining topics my townspeople but — hardly of great moment .</p>

     <p>This sarcophagus contained the body of Uresh-Nai , priestess to the goddess Mut , Mother of All —</p>
     <p>Run your finger against this edge ! — here went the chisel !— and think of an arrogance endured six thousand years without a flaw !</p>
     <p>But love is an oil to embalm the body . Love is a packet of spices , a strong smelling liquid to be squirted into the thigh . No ? Love rubbed on a bald head will make hair — and after ? Love is a lice comber ! Gnats on dung !</p>
     <p>“ The chisel is in your hand , the block is before you , cut as I shall dictate : this is the coffin of Uresh-Nai , priestess to the sky goddess ,— built to endure forever ! Carve the inside with the image of my death in little lines of figures three fingers high . Put a lid on it cut with Mut bending over the earth , for my headpiece , and in the year to be chosen I will rouse , the lid shall be lifted and I will walk about the temple where they have rested me and eat the air of the place :</p>
     <p>Ah — these walls are high ! This is in keeping .”</p>
     <p>III .</p>
     <p>The priestess has passed into her tomb . The stone has taken up her spirit ! Granite over flesh : who will deny its advantages ?</p>
     <p>Your death ?— water spilled upon the ground — though water will mount again into rose-leaves — but you ?— would hold life still , even as a memory , when it is over . Benevolence is rare .</p>
     <p>Climb about this sarcophagus , read what is writ for you in these figures , hard as the granite that has held them with so soft a hand the while your own flesh has been fifty times through the guts of oxen ,— read ! “ The rose-tree will have its donor even though he give stingily . The gift of some endures ten years , the gift of some twenty and the gift of some for the time a great house rots and is torn down . Some give for a thousand years to men of one face , some for a thousand to all men and some few to all men while granite holds an edge against the weather . Judge then of love !”</p>
     <p>IV .</p>
     <p>“ My flesh is turned to stone . I have endured my summer . The flurry of falling petals is ended . Lay the finger upon this granite . I was well desired and fully caressed by many lovers but my flesh withered swiftly and my heart was never satisfied . Lay your hands upon the granite as a lover lays his hand upon the thigh and upon the round breasts of her who is beside him , for now I will not wither , now I have thrown off secrecy , now I have walked naked into the street , now I have scattered my heavy beauty in the open market . Here I am with head high and a burning heart eagerly awaiting your caresses , whoever it may be , for granite is not harder than my love is open , runs loose among you !</p>
     <p>I arrogant against death ! I who have endured ! I worn against the years !”</p>
     <p>V .</p>
     <p>But it is five o ’ clock . Come ! Life is good — enjoy it ! A walk in the park while the day lasts . I will go with you . Look ! this northern scenery is not the Nile , but — these benches — the yellow and purple dusk — the moon there — these tired people — the lights on the water !</p>
     <p>Are not these Jews and — Ethiopians ? The world is young , surely ! Young and colored like — a girl that has come upon a lover ! Will that do ?</p>

     <p>Limb to limb , mouth to mouth with the bleached grass silver mist lies upon the back yards among the outhouses . The dwarf trees pirouette awkwardly to it — whirling round on one toe ; the big tree smiles and glances upward ! Tense with suppressed excitement the fences watch where the ground has humped an aching shoulder for the ecstasy .</p>

     <p>Ecstatic bird songs pound the hollow vastness of the sky with metallic clinkings — beating color up into it at a far edge ,— beating it , beating it with rising , triumphant ardor ,— stirring it into warmth , quickening in it a spreading change ,— bursting wildly against it as dividing the horizon , a heavy sun lifts himself — is lifted — bit by bit above the edge of things ,— runs free at last out into the open —! lumbering glorified in full release upward — songs cease .</p>

     <head>GOOD NIGHT</head>
     <p>In brilliant gas light I turn the kitchen spigot and watch the water plash into the clean white sink . On the grooved drain-board to one side is a glass filled with parsley — crisped green . Waiting for the water to freshen — I glance at the spotless floor —: a pair of rubber sandals lie side by side under the wall-table , all is in order for the night .</p>
     <p>Waiting , with a glass in my hand — three girls in crimson satin pass close before me on the murmurous background of the crowded opera — it is memory playing the clown — three vague , meaningless girls full of smells and the rustling sound of cloth rubbing on cloth and little slippers on carpet — high-school French spoken in a loud voice !</p>
     <p>Parsley in a glass , still and shining , brings me back . I take my drink and yawn deliciously . I am ready for bed .</p>

     <p>and — leaning his head away — snuffs ( secretly ) the bitter powder from his thumb ’ s hollow , takes your blessing and goes home to bed ?</p>

With what deep thirst we quicken our desires to that rank odor of a passing spring-time ! Can you not be decent ? Can you not reserve your ardors for something less unlovely ? What girl will care for us , do you think , if we continue in these ways ? Must you taste everything ? Must you know everything ? Must you have a part in everything ?</p>

     <p>First it will be a quiet pace to ease our stiffness but as the west yellows you will be ready !</p>

     <p>Vibrant bowing limbs pull downward , sucking in the sky that bulges from behind , plastering itself against them in packed rifts , rock blue and dirty orange ! But —</p>
     <p>( Hold hard , rigid jointed trees ! ) the blinding and red-edged sun-blur — creeping energy , concentrated counterforce — welds sky , buds , trees , rivets them in one puckering hold ! Sticks through ! Pulls the whole counter-pulling mass upward , to the right , locks even the opaque , not yet defined ground in a terrific drag that is loosening the very tap-roots !</p>

Is there no place where we can be at peace together and the motion of our drawing apart be altogether taken up ?

     <head>JANUARY MORNING</head>
     <head>SUITE</head>
      <head>I .</head>
     <p>I have discovered that most of the beauties of travel are due to the strange hours we keep to see them :</p>
     <p>the domes of the Church of the Paulist Fathers in Weehawken against a smoky dawn — the heart stirred — are beautiful as Saint Peters approached after years of anticipation .</p>
      <p>II .</p>
     <p>Though the operation was postponed I saw the tall probationers in their tan uniforms hurrying to breakfast !</p>
     <p>III .</p>
     <p>— and from basement entrys neatly coiffed , middle aged gentlemen with orderly moustaches and well brushed coats</p>
      <p>IV .</p>
     <p>— and the sun , dipping into the avenues streaking the tops of the irregular red houselets , and the gay shadows dropping and dropping .</p>
      <p>V .</p>
     <p>— and a young horse with a green bed-quilt on his withers shaking his head : bared teeth and nozzle high in the air !</p>
     <p>VI .</p>
     <p>— and a semicircle of dirt colored men about a fire bursting from an old ash can ,</p>
      <p>VII .</p>
     <p>— and the worn , blue car rails ( like the sky ! ) gleaming among the cobbles !</p>
      <p>VIII .</p>
     <p>— and the rickety ferry-boat “ Arden ”! What an object to be called “ Arden ” among the great piers ,— on the ever new river ! “ Put me a Touchstone at the wheel , white gulls , and we ’ ll follow the ghost of the Half Moon to the North West Passage — and through ! ( at Albany ! ) for all that !”</p>
      <p>IX .</p>
     <p>Exquisite brown waves — long circlets of silver moving over you ! enough with crumbling ice-crusts among you ! The sky has come down to you , lighter than tiny bubbles , face to face with you ! His spirit is a white gull with delicate pink feet and a snowy breast for you to hold to your lips delicately !</p>
     <p>X .</p>
     <p>The young doctor is dancing with happiness in the sparkling wind , alone at the prow of the ferry ! He notices the curdy barnacles and broken ice crusts left at the slip ’ s base by the low tide and thinks of summer and green shell crusted ledges among the emerald eel-grass !</p>
      <p>XI .</p>
     <p>Who knows the Palisades as I do knows the river breaks east from them above the city — but they continue south — under the sky — to bear a crest of little peering houses that brighten with dawn behind the moody water-loving giants of Manhattan .</p>

     <p>Rather notice , mon cher , that the moon is tilted above the point of the steeple than that its color is shell-pink .</p>
     <p>Rather observe that it is early morning than that the sky is smooth as a turquoise .</p>
     <p>Rather grasp how the dark converging lines of the steeple meet at the pinnacle — perceive how its little ornament tries to stop them —</p>
     <p>See how it fails ! See how the converging lines of the hexagonal spire escape upward — receding , dividing ! — sepals that guard and contain the flower !</p>
     <p>Observe how motionless the eaten moon lies in the protecting lines .</p>
     <p>It is true : in the light colors of morning brown-stone and slate shine orange and dark blue .</p>
     <p>But observe the oppressive weight of the squat edifice ! Observe the jasmine lightness of the moon .</p>

     <p>You exquisite chunk of mud Kathleen — just like any other chunk of mud ! — especially in April ! Curl up round their shoes when they try to step on you , spoil the polish ! I shall laugh till I am sick at their amazement . Do they expect the ground to be always solid ? Give them the slip then ; let them sit in you ; soil their pants ; teach them a dignity that is dignity , the dignity of mud !</p>
     <p>Lie basking in the sun then — fast asleep ! Even become dust on occasion .</p>

     <p>the stain of love is upon the world ! Yellow , yellow , yellow it eats into the leaves , smears with saffron the horned branches that lean heavily against a smooth purple sky !

       <l n="29">A little wistfully yet in a voice clear cut :</l>
       <l n="30">“ Good is my over lip and evil</l>
       <l n="31">My underlip to you henceforth :</l>
       <l n="32">For I have taken your soul between my two hands</l>
       <l n="33">And this shall be as it is spoken .”</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">And so it came to that last day</l>
       <l n="2">When , she leading by the hand , we went out</l>
       <l n="3">Early in the morning , I heavy of heart</l>
       <l n="4">For I knew the novitiate was ended</l>
       <l n="5">The ecstasy was over , the life begun .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="6">In my woolen shirt and the pale blue necktie</l>
       <l n="7">My grandmother gave me , there I went</l>
       <l n="8">With the old queen right past the houses</l>
       <l n="9">Of my friends down the hill to the river</l>
       <l n="10">As on any usual day , any errand .</l>
       <l n="11">Alone , walking under trees ,</l>
       <l n="12">I went with her , she with me in her wild hair ,</l>
       <l n="13">By Santiago Grove and presently</l>
       <l n="14">She bent forward and knelt by the river ,</l>
       <l n="15">The Passaic , that filthy river .</l>
       <l n="16">And there dabbling her mad hands ,</l>
       <l n="17">She called me close beside her .</l>
       <l n="18">Raising the water then in the cupped palm</l>
       <l n="19">She bathed our brows wailing and laughing :</l>
       <l n="20">“ River , we are old , you and I ,</l>
       <l n="21">We are old and by bad luck , beggars .</l>
       <l n="22">Lo , the filth in our hair , our bodies stink !</l>
       <l n="23">Old friend , here I have brought you</l>
       <l n="24">The young soul you long asked of me .</l>
       <l n="25">Stand forth , river , and give me</l>
       <l n="26">The old friend of my revels !</l>
       <l n="27">Give me the well-worn spirit ,</l>
       <l n="28">For here I have made a room for it ,</l>
       <l n="29">And I will return to you forthwith</l>
       <l n="30">The youth you have long asked of me :</l>
       <l n="31">Stand forth , river , and give me</l>
       <l n="32">The old friend of my revels !”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="33">And the filthy Passaic consented !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="34">Then she , leaping up with a fierce cry :</l>
       <l n="35">“ Enter , youth , into this bulk !</l>
       <l n="36">Enter , river , into this young man !”</l>
       <l n="37">Then the river began to enter my heart ,</l>
       <l n="38">Eddying back cool and limpid</l>
       <l n="39">Into the crystal beginning of its days .</l>
       <l n="40">But with the rebound it leaped forward :</l>
       <l n="41">Muddy , then black and shrunken</l>
       <l n="42">Till I felt the utter depth of its rottenness</l>
       <l n="43">The vile breadth of its degradation</l>
       <l n="44">And dropped down knowing this was me now .</l>
       <l n="45">But she lifted me and the water took a new tide</l>
       <l n="46">Again into the older experiences ,</l>
       <l n="47">And so , backward and forward ,</l>
       <l n="48">It tortured itself within me</l>
       <l n="49">Until time had been washed finally under ,</l>
       <l n="50">And the river had found its level</l>
       <l n="51">And its last motion had ceased</l>
       <l n="52">And I knew all — it became me .</l>
       <l n="53">And I knew this for double certain</l>
       <l n="54">For there , whitely , I saw myself</l>
       <l n="55">Being borne off under the water !</l>
       <l n="56">I could have shouted out in my agony</l>
       <l n="57">At the sight of myself departing</l>
       <l n="58">Forever — but I bit back my despair</l>
       <l n="59">For she had averted her eyes</l>
       <l n="60">By which I knew well what she was thinking —</l>
       <l n="61">And so the last of me was taken .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="62">Then she , “ Be mostly silent !”</l>
       <l n="63">And turning to the river , spoke again :</l>
       <l n="64">“ For him and for me , river , the wandering ,</l>
       <l n="65">But by you I leave for happiness</l>
       <l n="66">Deep foliage , the thickest beeches —</l>
       <l n="67">Though elsewhere they are all dying —</l>
       <l n="68">Tallest oaks and yellow birches</l>
       <l n="69">That dip their leaves in you , mourning ,</l>
       <l n="70">As now I dip my hair , immemorial</l>
       <l n="71">Of me , immemorial of him</l>
       <l n="72">Immemorial of these our promises !</l>
       <l n="73">Here shall be a bird ’ s paradise ,</l>
       <l n="74">They sing to you remembering my voice :</l>
       <l n="75">Here the most secluded spaces</l>
       <l n="76">For miles around , hallowed by a stench</l>
       <l n="77">To be our joint solitude and temple ;</l>
       <l n="78">In memory of this clear marriage</l>
       <l n="79">And the child I have brought you in the late years .</l>
       <l n="80">Live , river , live in luxuriance</l>
       <l n="81">Remembering this our son ,</l>
       <l n="82">In remembrance of me and my sorrow</l>
       <l n="83">And of the new wandering !”</l>
