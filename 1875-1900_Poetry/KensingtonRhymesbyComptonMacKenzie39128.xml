     <p>OUR HOUSE ] OUR house is very high and red , The steps are very white , The balcony is full of flowers , The knocker 's very bright . The hall has got a coloured lamp , A rack for father 's hat , And pegs for coats : a curious word [ A ] Is printed on the mat . The kitchen ticks too loud at night , It is a horrid place ; Black-beetles run about the floor At a most dreadful pace . The cellar is quite black with coal , The cat goes scratching there ; People go tramping past above , But nobody knows where . The dining-room has rosy walls , And silver knives and forks , And when I listen at the door , I hear the popping corks . The library smells like new boots , It is a woolly room ; The housemaid comes at eight o'clock And sweeps it with a broom . The staircase has a thousand rods That rattle if you kick , And when the twilight makes it blue I rush up very quick . The landing is a dismal place , The bannisters creak so , The door-knobs twinkle horribly , The gas is always low . The drawing-room is cold and white , The chairs have crooked legs ; Silk ladies rustle in and out While Fido sits and begs . The bathroom is a trickling room , And always smells of paint , The cupboard 's full of medicine For fever , cold or faint . My bedroom is a brassy room With pictures on the wall : It 's rather full of nurse 's clothes But then my own are small . Our house is very high and red , The steps are very white , The balcony is full of flowers , The knocker 's very bright . [ A ] Nobody knows what SALVE means [ Illustration : OUR SQUARE ] OUR square is really most select , Infectious children , dogs and cats Are not allowed to come inside , Nor any people from the flats . I have a sweetheart in the square , I bring her pebbles that I find , And curious shapes in mould , and sticks , And kiss her when she does not mind . She wears a dress of crackling white , A shiny sash of pink or blue , And over these a pinafore , And she comes out at half-past two . Her legs are tall and thin and black , Her eyes are very large and brown , And as she walks along the paths , Her frock moves slowly up and down . We all have sweethearts in our square , And when the winter comes again , We shall go to the dancing-class And watch them walking through the rain . [ Illustration : THE DANCING CLASS ] [ Illustration : THE DANCING CLASS ] EACH week on Friday night at six Our dancing-class begins : Two ladies dressed in white appear And play two violins . It 's really meant for boys at school , But girls can also come , And when you walk inside the room You hear a pleasant hum . The older boys wear Eton suits , The younger boys white tops ; We stand together in a row And practise curious hops . The dancing-master shows the step With many a puff and grunt ; He has a red silk handkerchief Stuck grandly in his front . He 's awfully excitable , His wrists are very strong , He drags you up and down the room Whenever you go wrong . And when you 're going very wrong , The girls begin to laugh ; And when you 're pushed back in your place , The boys turn round and chaff . We 've learnt the polka and the waltz , We 've got the ladies ’ chain ; Although he says our final bows Give him enormous pain . The floor is very slippery , It 's difficult to walk From one end to the other end Unless you sort of stalk . And when the steps have all been done , He takes you by the arm To choose a partner for the dance — It makes you get quite warm . You have to bow and look polite , And ask with a grimace The pleasure of the next quadrille , And slouch into your place . He always picks out girls you hate , I really do n't know why , And when you look across the room It almost makes you cry To see the girl you would have picked Dance with another boy Without a single smile for you , Determined to annoy . Your heart beats very loud and quick , Your breath comes very fast , You pinch your partner in the chain — But dances end at last . You think you will not look at her , You look the other way ; Yet when she beckons with her fan , You instantly obey . How quick the evening gallops by And eight o'clock comes soon , But not till you 've arranged to meet To-morrow afternoon . [ Illustration : MY SISTER AT A PARTY ] I HEAR the piano , the party 's begun ; Hurry up ! hurry up ! there is going to be fun . Leave your wrap in the hall and tie up your shoes , There is n't a moment , a moment to lose . Take a peep at the dining-room as you go by , Lemonade , claret cup , orange wine you will spy : And they 're going to have two sorts of ices this year , Both strawberry-cream and vanilla , I hear . Twelve dances are down on the programme , I see . Oh , do up your gloves , she is waiting for me ! I hear the piano , the polka 's begun ! Oh , why does your beastly old sash come undone ! That 's right , are your ready ? now do n't you forget To say how d'ye do and express your regret That Miss Perkins [ B ] is laid up in bed with a cold — It is n't my place — just you do as you 're told . I say , look at Frank , [ C ] he 's behaving as though He was playing with cads in a field full of snow ; He 's sliding about on the slippery floor All over the room with the kid from next door . It 's a jolly good thing that Miss Perkins ’ in bed , They 'll probably send old Eliza [ D ] instead . When we hear that she 's come , we 'll just not attend , Or tell her we never go home till the end . They give all the maids when they come , orange wine — I say , do you think I might ask her for nine . All right , only do n't say I danced more than twice ; If you do , I 'll say you have had more than one ice . Mother said that you could ? She said one of each ? You 'd better look out or I 'll jolly well peach . You do n't care if I do ? All right , just you wait ! You 'll tell Mrs. Jones we were not to be late ? I 'm not pinching at all , you beastly young sneak ! You wo n't follow me round when we play hide and seek ! There 's Dorothy ! [ E ] Pax ! You can eat what you like , And to-morrow I 'll give you a ride on my bike . [ B ] Miss Perkins is our governess ] [ C ] He 's my brother [ D ] Eliza is our housemaid [ E ] She 's an awfully decent girl I know . [ Illustration : KISSING GAMES ] POSTMAN 'S Knock ! Postman 's Knock ! A letter for the girl next door , And two pence , please , to pay . Kiss in the Ring ! Kiss in the Ring ! She 's fallen down upon the floor , I do n't know what to say . Postman 's Knock ! Postman 's Knock ! I wish that I had asked for more ; At games you must obey . Kiss in the Ring ! Kiss in the Ring ! When running after her I tore Her frock the other day . Postman 's Knock ! Postman 's Knock ! A letter for the girl next door , And a shilling she must pay . [ F ] [ F ] But she did n't [ Illustration : BALLAD OF THE ROUND POND ] THE Round Pond is a fine pond With fine ships sailing there , Cutters , yachts and men-o ’ - war , And sailor-boys everywhere . Paper boats they hug the shore , And row-boats move with string But cutters , yachts and larger ships Sail on like anything . [ Illustration : THE ROUND POND ] It was the schooner Kensington , Set out one Saturday : The wind was blowing from the east , The sky was cold and grey . Her crew stood on the quarter-deck And stared across the sea , With two brass cannon in the stern For the Royal Artillery . The Royal Tin Artillery Had faced the sea before , They had fallen in the bath one night And heard the waste-plug roar . They were rescued by the nursery maid And put on the ledge to dry ; And they looked more like the Volunteers Than the Royal Artillery . For the blue had all come off their clothes , And they afterwards wore grey ; But they stood by the cannon like Marines That famous Saturday . The crew of the schooner Kensington Were Dutchmen to a man , With wooden legs and painted eyes ; But the Captain he was bran . His blood was of the brownest bran And his clothes were full of tucks ; But he fell in the sea half-way across , And was eaten up by ducks . We launched the boat at half-past three , And stood on the bank to watch , And some friends of mine who were fishing there Had a wonderful minnow-catch . Fifteen minnows were caught at once In an ancient ginger jar , When a shout went up that the Kensington Was heeling over too far . Too far for a five-and-sixpenny ship That was warranted not to upset ; But she righted herself in half a tick Though the crew got very wet . The crew got very wet indeed ; The Artillery all fell down , And lay on their backs for the rest of the voyage For fear they were going to drown . The schooner Kensington sailed on Across the wild Round Pond , And we ran along the gravel-bank With a hook stuck into a wand . A hook stuck into a wand to guide The schooner safe ashore To incandescent harbour lights And a dock on the school-room floor . But suddenly the wind dropped dead . And a calm came over the sea , And a terrible rumour got abroad It was time to go home to tea . We whistled loud , we whistled long , The whole of that afternoon ; But there was n't wind enough to float A twopenny pink balloon . And the other chaps upon the bank Looked anxiously out to sea ; For their sweethearts and sisters were going home , And they feared for the cake at tea .</p>
