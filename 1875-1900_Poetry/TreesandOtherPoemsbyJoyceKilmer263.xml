    <epigraph>
     <p>Coventry Patmore To My Mother Gentlest of critics , does your memory hold ( I know it does ) a record of the days When I , a schoolboy , earned your generous praise For halting verse and stories crudely told ? Over these childish scrawls the years have rolled , They might not know the world 's unfriendly gaze ; But still your smile shines down familiar ways , Touches my words and turns their dross to gold . More dear to-day than in that vanished time Comes your nigh praise to make me proud and strong . In my poor notes you hear Love 's splendid chime , So unto you does this , my work belong . Take , then , a little gift of fragile rhyme : Your heart will change it to authentic song .</p>

     <p>The Twelve-Forty-Five</p>
     <p>( For Edward J. Wheeler )</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">Within the Jersey City shed</l>
       <l n="2">The engine coughs and shakes its head ,</l>
       <l n="3">The smoke , a plume of red and white ,</l>
       <l n="4">Waves madly in the face of night .</l>
       <l n="5">And now the grave incurious stars</l>
       <l n="6">Gleam on the groaning hurrying cars .</l>
       <l n="7">Against the kind and awful reign</l>
       <l n="8">Of darkness , this our angry train ,</l>
       <l n="9">A noisy little rebel , pouts</l>
       <l n="10">Its brief defiance , flames and shouts —</l>
       <l n="11">And passes on , and leaves no trace .</l>
       <l n="12">For darkness holds its ancient place ,</l>
       <l n="13">Serene and absolute , the king</l>
       <l n="14">Unchanged , of every living thing .</l>
       <l n="15">The houses lie obscure and still</l>
       <l n="16">In Rutherford and Carlton Hill .</l>
       <l n="17">Our lamps intensify the dark</l>
       <l n="18">Of slumbering Passaic Park .</l>
       <l n="19">And quiet holds the weary feet</l>
       <l n="20">That daily tramp through Prospect Street .</l>
       <l n="21">What though we clang and clank and roar</l>
       <l n="22">Through all Passaic 's streets ? No door</l>
       <l n="23">Will open , not an eye will see</l>
       <l n="24">Who this loud vagabond may be .</l>
       <l n="25">Upon my crimson cushioned seat ,</l>
       <l n="26">In manufactured light and heat ,</l>
       <l n="27">I feel unnatural and mean .</l>
       <l n="28">Outside the towns are cool and clean ;</l>
       <l n="29">Curtained awhile from sound and sight</l>
       <l n="30">They take God 's gracious gift of night .</l>
       <l n="31">The stars are watchful over them .</l>
       <l n="32">On Clifton as on Bethlehem</l>
       <l n="33">The angels , leaning down the sky ,</l>
       <l n="34">Shed peace and gentle dreams . And I —</l>
       <l n="35">I ride , I blasphemously ride</l>
       <l n="36">Through all the silent countryside .</l>
       <l n="37">The engine 's shriek , the headlight 's glare ,</l>
       <l n="38">Pollute the still nocturnal air .</l>
       <l n="39">The cottages of Lake View sigh</l>
       <l n="40">And sleeping , frown as we pass by .</l>
       <l n="41">Why , even strident Paterson</l>
       <l n="42">Rests quietly as any nun .</l>
       <l n="43">Her foolish warring children keep</l>
       <l n="44">The grateful armistice of sleep .</l>
       <l n="45">For what tremendous errand 's sake</l>
       <l n="46">Are we so blatantly awake ?</l>
       <l n="47">What precious secret is our freight ?</l>
       <l n="48">What king must be abroad so late ?</l>
       <l n="49">Perhaps Death roams the hills to-night</l>
       <l n="50">And we rush forth to give him fight .</l>
       <l n="51">Or else , perhaps , we speed his way</l>
       <l n="52">To some remote unthinking prey .</l>
       <l n="53">Perhaps a woman writhes in pain</l>
       <l n="54">And listens — listens for the train !</l>
       <l n="55">The train , that like an angel sings ,</l>
       <l n="56">The train , with healing on its wings .</l>
       <l n="57">Now “ Hawthorne ! ” the conductor cries .</l>
       <l n="58">My neighbor starts and rubs his eyes .</l>
       <l n="59">He hurries yawning through the car</l>
       <l n="60">And steps out where the houses are .</l>
       <l n="61">This is the reason of our quest !</l>
       <l n="62">Not wantonly we break the rest</l>
       <l n="63">Of town and village , nor do we</l>
       <l n="64">Lightly profane night 's sanctity .</l>
       <l n="65">What Love commands the train fulfills ,</l>
       <l n="66">And beautiful upon the hills</l>
       <l n="67">Are these our feet of burnished steel .</l>
       <l n="68">Subtly and certainly I feel</l>
       <l n="69">That Glen Rock welcomes us to her</l>
       <l n="70">And silent Ridgewood seems to stir</l>
       <l n="71">And smile , because she knows the train</l>
       <l n="72">Has brought her children back again .</l>
       <l n="73">We carry people home — and so</l>
       <l n="74">God speeds us , wheresoe'er we go .</l>
       <l n="75">Hohokus , Waldwick , Allendale</l>
       <l n="76">Lift sleepy heads to give us hail .</l>
       <l n="77">In Ramsey , Mahwah , Suffern stand</l>
       <l n="78">Houses that wistfully demand</l>
       <l n="79">A father — son — some human thing</l>
       <l n="80">That this , the midnight train , may bring .</l>
       <l n="81">The trains that travel in the day</l>
       <l n="82">They hurry folks to work or play .</l>
       <l n="83">The midnight train is slow and old</l>
       <l n="84">But of it let this thing be told ,</l>
       <l n="85">To its high honor be it said</l>
       <l n="86">It carries people home to bed .</l>
       <l n="87">My cottage lamp shines white and clear .</l>
       <l n="88">God bless the train that brought me here .</l>

       <l n="1">The House with Nobody in It</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="2">Whenever I walk to Suffern along the Erie track</l>
       <l n="3">I go by a poor old farmhouse with its shingles broken and black .</l>
       <l n="4">I suppose I 've passed it a hundred times , but I always stop for a minute</l>
       <l n="5">And look at the house , the tragic house , the house with nobody in it .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="6">I never have seen a haunted house , but I hear there are such things ;</l>
       <l n="7">That they hold the talk of spirits , their mirth and sorrowings .</l>
       <l n="8">I know this house is n't haunted , and I wish it were , I do ;</l>
       <l n="9">For it would n't be so lonely if it had a ghost or two .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="10">This house on the road to Suffern needs a dozen panes of glass ,</l>
       <l n="11">And somebody ought to weed the walk and take a scythe to the grass .</l>
       <l n="12">It needs new paint and shingles , and the vines should be trimmed and tied ;</l>
       <l n="13">But what it needs the most of all is some people living inside .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="14">If I had a lot of money and all my debts were paid</l>
       <l n="15">I 'd put a gang of men to work with brush and saw and spade .</l>
       <l n="16">I 'd buy that place and fix it up the way it used to be</l>
       <l n="17">And I 'd find some people who wanted a home and give it to them free .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="18">Now , a new house standing empty , with staring window and door ,</l>
       <l n="19">Looks idle , perhaps , and foolish , like a hat on its block in the store .</l>
       <l n="20">But there 's nothing mournful about it ; it cannot be sad and lone</l>
       <l n="21">For the lack of something within it that it has never known .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="22">But a house that has done what a house should do ,</l>
       <l n="23">a house that has sheltered life ,</l>
       <l n="24">That has put its loving wooden arms around a man and his wife ,</l>
       <l n="25">A house that has echoed a baby 's laugh and held up his stumbling feet ,</l>
       <l n="26">Is the saddest sight , when it 's left alone , that ever your eyes could meet .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="27">So whenever I go to Suffern along the Erie track</l>
       <l n="28">I never go by the empty house without stopping and looking back ,</l>
       <l n="29">Yet it hurts me to look at the crumbling roof and the shutters fallen apart ,</l>
       <l n="30">For I can n't help thinking the poor old house is a house with a broken heart .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="2">There 's a brook on the side of Greylock that used to be full of trout ,</l>
       <l n="3">But there 's nothing there now but minnows ; they say it is all fished out .</l>
       <l n="4">I fished there many a Summer day some twenty years ago ,</l>
       <l n="5">And I never quit without getting a mess of a dozen or so .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="6">There was a man , Dave Lilly , who lived on the North Adams road ,</l>
       <l n="7">And he spent all his time fishing , while his neighbors reaped and sowed .</l>
       <l n="8">He was the luckiest fisherman in the Berkshire hills , I think .</l>
       <l n="9">And when he did n't go fishing he 'd sit in the tavern and drink .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="10">Well , Dave is dead and buried and nobody cares very much ;</l>
       <l n="11">They have no use in Greylock for drunkards and loafers and such .</l>
       <l n="12">But I always liked Dave Lilly , he was pleasant as you could wish ;</l>
       <l n="13">He was shiftless and good-for-nothing , but he certainly could fish .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="14">The other night I was walking up the hill from Williamstown</l>
       <l n="15">And I came to the brook I mentioned ,</l>
       <l n="16">and I stopped on the bridge and sat down .</l>
       <l n="17">I looked at the blackened water with its little flecks of white</l>
       <l n="18">And I heard it ripple and whisper in the still of the Summer night .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="19">And after I 'd been there a minute it seemed to me I could feel</l>
       <l n="20">The presence of someone near me , and I heard the hum of a reel .</l>
       <l n="21">And the water was churned and broken , and something was brought to land</l>
       <l n="22">By a twist and flirt of a shadowy rod in a deft and shadowy hand .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="23">I scrambled down to the brookside and hunted all about ;</l>
       <l n="24">There was n't a sign of a fisherman ; there was n't a sign of a trout .</l>
       <l n="25">But I heard somebody chuckle behind the hollow oak</l>
       <l n="26">And I got a whiff of tobacco like Lilly used to smoke .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="27">It 's fifteen years , they tell me , since anyone fished that brook ;</l>
       <l n="28">And there 's nothing in it but minnows that nibble the bait off your hook .</l>
       <l n="29">But before the sun has risen and after the moon has set</l>
       <l n="30">I know that it 's full of ghostly trout for Lilly 's ghost to get .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="9">
       <l n="31">I guess I 'll go to the tavern and get a bottle of rye</l>
       <l n="32">And leave it down by the hollow oak , where Lilly 's ghost went by .</l>
       <l n="33">I meant to go up on the hillside and try to find his grave</l>
       <l n="34">And put some flowers on it — but this will be better for Dave .</l>
