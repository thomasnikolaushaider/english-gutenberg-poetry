   <head>ARGUMENT</head>
   <p>After much struggling and loss in love and in the world of man , the protagonist throws in his lot with a woman who is already married . Together they go into another country , she perforce leaving her children behind . The conflict of love and hate goes on between the man and the woman , and between these two and the world around them , till it reaches some sort of conclusion , they transcend into some condition of blessedness</p>

     <l n="1">AND who has seen the moon , who has not seen</l>
     <l n="2">Her rise from out the chamber of the deep ,</l>
     <l n="3">Flushed and grand and naked , as from the chamber</l>
     <l n="4">Of finished bridegroom , seen her rise and throw</l>
     <l n="5">Confession of delight upon the wave ,</l>
     <l n="6">Littering the waves with her own superscription</l>
     <l n="7">Of bliss , till all her lambent beauty shakes towards</l>
     <l n="8">us</l>
     <l n="9">Spread out and known at last , and we are sure</l>
     <l n="10">That beauty is a thing beyond the grave ,</l>
     <l n="11">That perfect , bright experience never falls</l>
     <l n="12">To nothingness , and time will dim the moon</l>
     <l n="13">Sooner than our full consummation here</l>
     <l n="14">In this odd life will tarnish or pass away .</l>

   <p>Still in the vast hollow Like a breath in a bubble spinning Brushing the stars , goes my soul , that skims the bounds like a swallow !</p>

   <p>No , now I wish the sunshine would stop , and the white shining houses , and the gay red flowers on the balconies and the bluish mountains beyond , would be crushed out between two valves of darkness ; the darkness falling , the darkness rising , with muffled sound obliterating everything .</p>
   <p>I wish that whatever props up the walls of light would fall , and darkness would come hurling heavily down , and it would be thick black dark for ever . Not sleep , which is grey with dreams , nor death , which quivers with birth , but heavy , sealing darkness , silence , all immovable .</p>
   <p>What is sleep ? It goes over me , like a shadow over a hill , but it does not alter me , nor help me . And death would ache still , I am sure ; it would be lambent , uneasy . I wish it would be completely dark everywhere , inside me , and out , heavily dark utterly .</p>

   <p>A DOE AT EVENING</p>
   <p>As I went through the marshes a doe sprang out of the corn and flashed up the hill-side leaving her fawn .</p>
   <p>On the sky-line she moved round to watch , she pricked a fine black blotch on the sky .</p>
   <p>I looked at her and felt her watching ; I became a strange being . Still , I had my right to be there with her ,</p>
   <p>Her nimble shadow trotting along the sky-line , she put back her fine , level-balanced head . And I knew her .</p>
   <p>Ah yes , being male , is not my head hard-balanced , antlered ? Are not my haunches light ? Has she not fled on the same wind with me ? Does not my fear cover her fear ?</p>

   <p>Yes , bunch yourself between my knees and lie still . Lie on me with a hot , plumb , live weight , heavy as a stone , passive , yet hot , waiting .</p>
   <p>What are you waiting for ? What are you waiting for ? What is the hot , plumb weight of your desire on me ? You have a hot , unthinkable desire of me , bunny .</p>
   <p>What is that spark glittering at me on the unutterable darkness of your eye , bunny ? The finest splinter of a spark that you throw off , straight on the tinder of my nerves !</p>
   <p>It sets up a strange fire , a soft , most unwarrantable burning a bale-fire mounting , mounting up in me .</p>
   <p>‘ Tis not of me , bunny . It was you engendered it , with that fine , demoniacal spark you jetted off your eye at me .</p>
   <p>I did not want it , this furnace , this draught-maddened fire which mounts up my arms making them swell with turgid , ungovernable strength .</p>
   <p>‘ Twas not I that wished it , that my fingers should turn into these flames avid and terrible that they are at this moment .</p>
   <p>It must have been your inbreathing , gaping desire that drew this red gush in me ; I must be reciprocating your vacuous , hideous passion .</p>
   <p>It must be the want in you that has drawn this terrible draught of white fire up my veins as up a chimney .</p>
   <p>It must be you who desire this intermingling of the black and monstrous fingers of Moloch in the blood-jets of your throat .</p>
   <p>Come , you shall have your desire , since already I am implicated with you in your strange lust .</p>

     <l n="41">“ SHE SAID AS WELL TO ME ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>SHE said as well to me : “ Why are you ashamed ? That little bit of your chest that shows between the gap of your shirt , why cover it up ? Why should n't your legs and your good strong thighs be rough and hairy ?— I 'm glad they are like that . You are shy , you silly , you silly shy thing . Men are the shyest creatures , they never will come out of their covers . Like any snake slipping into its bed of dead leaves , you hurry into your clothes . And I love you so ! Straight and clean and all of a piece is the body of a man , such an instrument , a spade , like a spear , or an oar , such a joy to me — ” So she laid her hands and pressed them down my sides , so that I began to wonder over myself , and what I was .</p>
   <p>She said to me : “ What an instrument , your body ! single and perfectly distinct from everything else ! What a tool in the hands of the Lord ! Only God could have brought it to its shape . It feels as if his handgrasp , wearing you had polished you and hollowed you , hollowed this groove in your sides , grasped you under the breasts and brought you to the very quick of your form , subtler than an old , soft-worn fiddle-bow .</p>
   <p>“ When I was a child , I loved my father 's riding - whip that he used so often . I loved to handle it , it seemed like a near part of him . So I did his pens , and the jasper seal on his desk . Something seemed to surge through me when I touched them .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ So it is with you , but here</l>
     <l n="2">The joy I feel !</l>
     <l n="3">God knows what I feel , but it is joy !</l>
     <l n="4">Look , you are clean and fine and singled out !</l>
     <l n="5">I admire you so , you are beautiful : this clean</l>
     <l n="6">sweep of your sides , this firmness , this hard</l>
     <l n="7">mould !</l>
     <l n="8">I would die rather than have it injured with one</l>
     <l n="9">scar .</l>
     <l n="10">I wish I could grip you like the fist of the Lord ,</l>
     <l n="11">and have you — ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>So she said , and I wondered , feeling trammelled and hurt . It did not make me free .</p>
   <p>Now I say to her : “ No tool , no instrument , no God ! Do n't touch me and appreciate me . It is an infamy . You would think twice before you touched a weasel on a fence as it lifts its straight white throat . Your hand would not be so flig and easy . Nor the adder we saw asleep with her head on her shoulder , curled up in the sunshine like a princess ; when she lifted her head in delicate , startled wonder you did not stretch forward to caress her though she looked rarely beautiful and a miracle as she glided delicately away , with such dignity . And the young bull in the field , with his wrinkled , sad face , you are afraid if he rises to his feet , though he is all wistful and pathetic , like a mono - lith , arrested , static .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Is there nothing in me to make you hesitate ?</l>
     <l n="2">I tell you there is all these .</l>
     <l n="3">And why should you overlook them in me ?— ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>NEW HEAVEN AND EARTH</p>
    <p>I</p>
   <p>AND so I cross into another world shyly and in homage linger for an invitation from this unknown that I would trespass on .</p>
   <p>I am very glad , and all alone in the world , all alone , and very glad , in a new world where I am disembarked at last .</p>
   <p>I could cry with joy , because I am in the new world , just ventured in . I could cry with joy , and quite freely , there is nobody to know .</p>
   <p>And whosoever the unknown people of this un - known world may be they will never understand my weeping for joy to be adventuring among them because it will still be a gesture of the old world I am making which they will not understand , because it is quite , quite foreign to them .</p>

    <head>I WAS so weary of the world I was so sick of it everything was tainted with myself , skies , trees , flowers , birds , water , people , houses , streets , vehicles , machines , nations , armies , war , peace-talking , work , recreation , governing , anarchy , it was all tainted with myself , I knew it all to start with because it was all myself .</head>
     <l n="1">When I gathered flowers , I knew it was myself</l>
     <l n="2">plucking my own flowering .</l>
     <l n="3">When I went in a train , I knew it was myself</l>

   <p>III</p>
   <p>I SHALL never forget the maniacal horror of it all in the end when everything was me , I knew it all already , I anticipated it all in my soul because I was the author and the result I was the God and the creation at once ; creator , I looked at my creation ; created , I looked at myself , the creator : it was a maniacal horror in the end .</p>
   <p>I was a lover , I kissed the woman I loved , and God of horror , I was kissing also myself . I was a father and a begetter of children , and oh , oh horror , I was begetting and conceiving in my own body .</p>
   <p>IV</p>
   <p>AT last came death , sufficiency of death , and that at last relieved me , I died . I buried my beloved ; it was good , I buried myself and was gone . War came , and every hand raised to murder ; very good , very good , every hand raised to murder ! Very good , very good , I am a murderer ! It is good , I can murder and murder , and see them fall the mutilated , horror-struck youths , a multitude one on another , and then in clusters together smashed , all oozing with blood , and burned in heaps going up in a foetid smoke to get rid of them the murdered bodies of youths and men in heaps and heaps and heaps and horrible reeking heaps till it is almost enough , till I am reduced perhaps ; thousands and thousands of gaping , hideous foul dead that are youths and men and me being burned with oil , and consumed in corrupt thick smoke , that rolls and taints and blackens the sky , till at last it is dark , dark as night , or death , or hell and I am dead , and trodden to nought in the smoke-sodden tomb ; dead and trodden to nought in the sour black earth of the tomb ; dead and trodden to nought , trodden to nought .</p>
    <p>V</p>
   <p>GOD , but it is good to have died and been trodden out trodden to nought in sour , dead earth quite to nought absolutely to nothing nothing nothing nothing .</p>
   <p>For when it is quite , quite nothing , then it is everything . When I am trodden quite out , quite , quite out every vestige gone , then I am here risen , and setting my foot on another world risen , accomplishing a resurrection risen , not born again , but risen , body the same as before , new beyond knowledge of newness , alive beyond life proud beyond inkling or furthest conception of pride living where life was never yet dreamed of , nor hinted at here , in the other world , still terrestrial myself , the same as before , yet unaccountably new .</p>
   <p>VI</p>
   <p>I , IN the sour black tomb , trodden to absolute death I put out my hand in the night , one night , and my hand touched that which was verily not me verily it was not me . Where I had been was a sudden blaze a sudden flaring blaze ! So I put my hand out further , a little further and I felt that which was not I , it verily was not I it was the unknown .</p>
   <p>Ha , I was a blaze leaping up ! I was a tiger bursting into sunlight . I was greedy , I was mad for the unknown . I , new-risen , resurrected , starved from the tomb starved from a life of devouring always myself now here was I , new-awakened , with my hand stretching out and touching the unknown , the real unknown , the unknown unknown .</p>

   <p>IT was the flank of my wife I touched with my hand , I clutched with my hand rising , new-awakened from the tomb ! It was the flank of my wife whom I married years ago at whose side I have lain for over a thousand nights and all that previous while , she was I , she was I ; I touched her , it was I who touched and I who was touched .</p>
   <p>Yet rising from the tomb , from the black oblivion stretching out my hand , my hand flung like a drowned man 's hand on a rock , I touched her flank and knew I was carried by the current in death over to the new world , and was climbing out on the shore , risen , not to the old world , the old , changeless I , the old life , wakened not to the old knowledge but to a new earth , a new I , a new knowledge , a new world of time .</p>
   <p>Ah no , I cannot tell you what it is , the new world I cannot tell you the mad , astounded rapture of its discovery . I shall be mad with delight before I have done , and whosoever comes after will find me in the new world a madman in rapture .</p>
   <p>VIII</p>
   <p>GREEN streams that flow from the innermost continent of the new world , what are they ? Green and illumined and travelling for ever dissolved with the mystery of the innermost heart of the continent mystery beyond knowledge or endurance , so sump - tuous out of the well-heads of the new world .— The other , she too has strange green eyes ! White sands and fruits unknown and perfumes that never can blow across the dark seas to our usual world ! And land that beats with a pulse ! And valleys that draw close in love ! And strange ways where I fall into oblivion of uttermost living !— Also she who is the other has strange-mounded breasts and strange sheer slopes , and white levels .</p>
   <p>Sightless and strong oblivion in utter life takes possession of me ! The unknown , strong current of life supreme drowns me and sweeps me away and holds me down to the sources of mystery , in the depths , extinguishes there my risen resurrected life and kindles it further at the core of utter mystery .</p>

    <head>MANIFESTO</head>
    <lg type="part" n="1">
     <head>I</head>
      <l n="1">A WOMAN has given me strength and affluence .</l>
      <l n="2">Admitted !</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>All the rocking wheat of Canada , ripening now , has not so much of strength as the body of one woman sweet in ear , nor so much to give though it feed nations .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Hunger is the very Satan .</l>
     <l n="2">The fear of hunger is Moloch , Belial , the horrible</l>
     <l n="3">God .</l>
     <l n="4">It is a fearful thing to be dominated by the fear of</l>
     <l n="5">hunger .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Not bread alone , not the belly nor the thirsty throat . I have never yet been smitten through the belly , with the lack of bread , no , nor even milk and honey .</p>
   <p>The fear of the want of these things seems to be quite left out of me . For so much , I thank the good generations of man - kind .</p>
   <p>II</p>
   <p>AND the sweet , constant , balanced heat of the suave sensitive body , the hunger for this has never seized me and terrified me . Here again , man has been good in his legacy to us , in these two primary instances .</p>
    <p>III</p>
   <p>THEN the dumb , aching , bitter , helpless need , the pining to be initiated , to have access to the knowledge that the great dead have opened up for us , to know , to satisfy the great and dominant hunger of the mind ; man 's sweetest harvest of the centuries , sweet , printed books , bright , glancing , exquisite corn of many a stubborn glebe in the upturned darkness ; I thank mankind with passionate heart that I just escaped the hunger for these , that they were given when I needed them , because I am the son of man .</p>
   <p>I have eaten , and drunk , and warmed and clothed my body , I have been taught the language of understanding , I have chosen among the bright and marvellous books , like any prince , such stores of the world 's supply were open to me , in the wisdom and goodness of man . So far , so good . Wise , good provision that makes the heart swell with love !</p>
   <p>IV</p>
   <p>BUT then came another hunger very deep , and ravening ; the very body 's body crying out with a hunger more frightening , more profound than stomach or throat or even the mind ; redder than death , more clamorous .</p>
   <p>The hunger for the woman . Alas , it is so deep a Moloch , ruthless and strong , ‘ tis like the unutterable name of the dread Lord , not to be spoken aloud . Yet there it is , the hunger which comes upon us , which we must learn to satisfy with pure , real satisfaction ; or perish , there is no alternative .</p>
   <p>I thought it was woman , indiscriminate woman , mere female adjunct of what I was . Ah , that was torment hard enough and a thing to be afraid of , a threatening , torturing , phallic Moloch .</p>
   <p>A woman fed that hunger in me at last . What many women cannot give , one woman can ; so I have known it .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">She stood before me like riches that were mine .</l>
     <l n="2">Even then , in the dark , I was tortured , ravening ,</l>
     <l n="3">unfree ,</l>
     <l n="4">Ashamed , and shameful , and vicious .</l>
     <l n="5">A man is so terrified of strong hunger ;</l>
     <l n="6">and this terror is the root of all cruelty .</l>
     <l n="7">She loved me , and stood before me , looking to me .</l>
     <l n="8">How could I look , when I was mad ? I looked</l>
     <l n="9">sideways , furtively ,</l>
     <l n="10">being mad with voracious desire .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>V</p>
   <p>THIS comes right at last . When a man is rich , he loses at last the hunger fear . I lost at last the fierceness that fears it will starve . I could put my face at last between her breasts and know that they were given for ever that I should never starve never perish ; I had eaten of the bread that satisfies and my body 's body was appeased , there was peace and richness , fulfilment .</p>
   <p>Let them praise desire who will , but only fulfilment will do , real fulfilment , nothing short . It is our ratification our heaven , as a matter of fact . Immortality , the heaven , is only a projection of this strange but actual fulfilment , here in the flesh .</p>
   <p>So , another hunger was supplied , and for this I have to thank one woman , not mankind , for mankind would have prevented me ; but one woman , and these are my red-letter thanksgivings .</p>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>VI</head>
     <l n="1">To be , or not to be , is still the question .</l>
     <l n="2">This ache for being is the ultimate hunger .</l>
     <l n="3">And for myself , I can say “ almost , almost , oh ,</l>
     <l n="4">very nearly . ”</l>
     <l n="5">Yet something remains .</l>
     <l n="6">Something shall not always remain .</l>
     <l n="7">For the main already is fulfilment .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>What remains in me , is to be known even as I know . I know her now : or perhaps , I know my own limitation against her .</p>
   <p>Plunging as I have done , over , over the brink I have dropped at last headlong into nought , plunging upon sheer hard extinction ; I have come , as it were , not to know , died , as it were ; ceased from knowing ; surpassed myself . What can I say more , except that I know what it is to surpass myself ?</p>
   <p>It is a kind of death which is not death . It is going a little beyond the bounds . How can one speak , where there is a dumbness on one 's mouth ? I suppose , ultimately she is all beyond me , she is all not-me , ultimately . It is that that one comes to . A curious agony , and a relief , when I touch that which is not me in any sense , it wounds me to death with my own not-being ; definite , inviolable limitation , and something beyond , quite beyond , if you understand what that means . It is the major part of being , this having surpassed oneself , this having touched the edge of the beyond , and perished , yet not perished .</p>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>VII</head>
     <l n="1">I WANT her though , to take the same from me .</l>
     <l n="2">She touches me as if I were herself , her own .</l>
     <l n="3">She has not realized yet , that fearful thing , that</l>
     <l n="4">I am the other ,</l>
     <l n="5">she thinks we are all of one piece .</l>
     <l n="6">It is painfully untrue .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>I want her to touch me at last , ah , on the root and quick of my darkness and perish on me , as I have perished on her .</p>
   <p>Then , we shall be two and distinct , we shall have each our separate being . And that will be pure existence , real liberty . Till then , we are confused , a mixture , unresolved , unextricated one from the other . It is in pure , unutterable resolvedness , distinction of being , that one is free , not in mixing , merging , not in similarity . When she has put her hand on my secret , darkest sources , the darkest outgoings , when it has struck home to her , like a death , “ this is him ! ” she has no part in it , no part whatever , it is the terrible other , when she knows the fearful other flesh , ah , dark - ness unfathomable and fearful , contiguous and concrete , when she is slain against me , and lies in a heap like one outside the house , when she passes away as I have passed away being pressed up against the other , then I shall be glad , I shall not be confused with her , I shall be cleared , distinct , single as if burnished in silver , having no adherence , no adhesion anywhere , one clear , burnished , isolated being , unique , and she also , pure , isolated , complete , two of us , unutterably distinguished , and in unutterable conjunction .</p>
   <p>Then we shall be free , freer than angels , ah , perfect .</p>
   <p>VIII</p>
   <p>AFTER that , there will only remain that all men detach themselves and become unique , that we are all detached , moving in freedom more than the angels , conditioned only by our own pure single being , having no laws but the laws of our own being .</p>
   <p>Every human being will then be like a flower , untrammelled . Every movement will be direct . Only to be will be such delight , we cover our faces when we think of it lest our faces betray us to some untimely fiend .</p>
   <p>Every man himself , and therefore , a surpassing singleness of mankind . The blazing tiger will spring upon the deer , un - dimmed , the hen will nestle over her chickens , we shall love , we shall hate , but it will be like music , sheer utterance , issuing straight out of the unknown , the lightning and the rainbow appearing in us unbidden , unchecked , like ambassadors .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">We shall not look before and after .</l>
     <l n="2">We shall be , now .</l>
     <l n="3">We shall know in full .</l>
     <l n="4">We , the mystic NOW .</l>

   <p>AUTUMN RAIN</p>
   <p>THE plane leaves fall black and wet on the lawn ;</p>
   <p>The cloud sheaves in heaven 's fields set droop and are drawn</p>
   <p>in falling seeds of rain ; the seed of heaven on my face</p>
   <p>falling — I hear again like echoes even that softly pace</p>
   <p>Heaven 's muffled floor , the winds that tread out all the grain</p>
   <p>of tears , the store harvested in the sheaves of pain</p>
   <p>caught up aloft : the sheaves of dead men that are slain</p>
   <p>now winnowed soft on the floor of heaven ; manna invisible</p>
   <p>of all the pain here to us given ; finely divisible falling as rain .</p>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>FROST FLOWERS</head>
    <head>IT is not long since , here among all these folk in London , I should have held myself of no account whatever , but should have stood aside and made them way thinking that they , perhaps , had more right than I — for who was I ?</head>
     <l n="1">Now I see them just the same , and watch them .</l>
     <l n="2">But of what account do I hold them ?</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Especially the young women . I look at them as they dart and flash before the shops , like wagtails on the edge of a pool .</p>
   <p>If I pass them close , or any man , like sharp , slim wagtails they flash a little aside pretending to avoid us ; yet all the time calculating .</p>
   <p>They think that we adore them — alas , would it were true !</p>
   <p>Probably they think all men adore them , howsoever they pass by .</p>
   <p>What is it , that , from their faces fresh as spring , such fair , fresh , alert , first-flower faces , like lavender crocuses , snowdrops , like Roman hyacinths , scyllas and yellow-haired hellebore , jonquils , dim anemones , even the sulphur auriculas , flowers that come first from the darkness , and feel cold to the touch , flowers scentless or pungent , ammoniacal almost ; what is it , that , from the faces of the fair young women comes like a pungent scent , a vibration beneath that startles me , alarms me , stirs up a repulsion ?</p>
   <p>They are the issue of acrid winter , these first - flower young women ; their scent is lacerating and repellant , it smells of burning snow , of hot-ache , of earth , winter-pressed , strangled in corruption ; it is the scent of the fiery-cold dregs of corruption , when destruction soaks through the mortified , decomposing earth , and the last fires of dissolution burn in the bosom of the ground .</p>
   <p>They are the flowers of ice-vivid mortification , thaw-cold , ice-corrupt blossoms , with a loveliness I loathe ; for what kind of ice-rotten , hot-aching heart must they need to root in !</p>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>CRAVING FOR SPRING</head>
     <l n="1">I WISH it were spring in the world .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Let it be spring ! Come , bubbling , surging tide of sap ! Come , rush of creation ! Come , life ! surge through this mass of mortifica - tion ! Come , sweep away these exquisite , ghastly first - flowers , which are rather last-flowers ! Come , thaw down their cool portentousness , dissolve them : snowdrops , straight , death-veined exhalations of white and purple crocuses , flowers of the penumbra , issue of corruption , nourished in mortification , jets of exquisite finality ; Come , spring , make havoc of them !</p>
   <p>I trample on the snowdrops , it gives me pleasure to tread down the jonquils , to destroy the chill Lent lilies ; for I am sick of them , their faint-bloodedness , slow-blooded , icy-fleshed , portentous .</p>
   <p>I want the fine , kindling wine-sap of spring , gold , and of inconceivably fine , quintessential brightness , rare almost as beams , yet overwhelmingly potent , strong like the greatest force of world-balancing .</p>
   <p>This is the same that picks up the harvest of wheat and rocks it , tons of grain , on the ripening wind ; the same that dangles the globe-shaped pleiads of fruit temptingly in mid-air , between a playful thumb and finger ; oh , and suddenly , from out of nowhere , whirls the pear-bloom , upon us , and apple - and almond - and apricot - and quince-blossom , storms and cumulus clouds of all imaginable blossom about our bewildered faces , though we do not worship .</p>
   <p>I wish it were spring cunningly blowing on the fallen sparks , odds and ends of the old , scattered fire , and kindling shapely little conflagrations curious long-legged foals , and wide-eared calves , and naked sparrow-bubs .</p>
   <p>I wish that spring would start the thundering traffic of feet new feet on the earth , beating with impatience .</p>
   <p>I wish it were spring , thundering delicate , tender spring . I wish these brittle , frost-lovely flowers of pas - sionate , mysterious corruption were not yet to come still more from the still - flickering discontent .</p>
   <p>Oh , in the spring , the bluebell bows him down for very exuberance , exulting with secret warm excess , bowed down with his inner magnificence !</p>
   <p>Oh , yes , the gush of spring is strong enough to toss the globe of earth like a ball on a water-jet dancing sportfully ; as you see a tiny celluloid ball tossing on a squint of water for men to shoot at , penny-a-time , in a booth at a fair .</p>
   <p>The gush of spring is strong enough to play with the globe of earth like a ball on a fountain ; At the same time it opens the tiny hands of the hazel with such infinite patience .</p>
   <p>The power of the rising , golden , all-creative sap could take the earth and heave it off among the stars , into the in - visible ; the same sets the throstle at sunset on a bough singing against the blackbird ; comes out in the hesitating tremor of the primrose , and betrays its candour in the round white straw - berry flower , is dignified in the foxglove , like a Red-Indian brave .</p>
   <p>Ah come , come quickly , spring ! Come and lift us towards our culmination , we myriads ; we who have never flowered , like patient cactuses . Come and lift us to our end , to blossom , bring us to our summer we who are winter-weary in the winter of the world . Come making the chaffinch nests hollow and cosy , come and soften the willow buds till they are puffed and furred , then blow them over with gold . Come and cajole the gawky colt'shYpppHeNfoot flowers .</p>
   <p>Come quickly , and vindicate us against too much death . Come quickly , and stir the rotten globe of the world from within , burst it with germination , with world anew . Come now , to us , your adherents , who cannot flower from the ice . All the world gleams with the lilies of Death the Unconquerable , but come , give us our turn . Enough of the virgins and lilies , of passionate , suffocating perfume of corruption , no more narcissus perfume , lily harlots , the blades of sensation piercing the flesh to blossom of death . Have done , have done with this shuddering , delicious business of thrilling ruin in the flesh , of pungent passion , of rare , death-edged ecstasy . Give us our turn , give us a chance , let our hour strike , O soon , soon !</p>
   <p>Let the darkness turn violet with rich dawn . Let the darkness be warmed , warmed through to a ruddy violet , incipient purpling towards summer in the world of the heart of man .</p>
   <p>Are the violets already here ! Show me ! I tremble so much to hear it , that even now on the threshold of spring , I fear I shall die . Show me the violets that are out .</p>
   <p>Oh , if it be true , and the living darkness of the blood of man is purpling with violets , if the violets are coming out from under the rack of men , winter-rotten and fallen we shall have spring . Pray not to die on this Pisgah blossoming with violets . Pray to live through .</p>
   <p>If you catch a whiff of violets from the darkness of the shadow of man it will be spring in the world , it will be spring in the world of the living ; wonderment organising itself , heralding itself with the violets , stirring of new seasons .</p>
   <p>Ah , do not let me die on the brink of such anticipation ! Worse , let me not deceive myself .</p>
