    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="48">“ How , how , ” he said . “ Friend Chang , ” I said ,</l>
     <l n="49">“ San Francisco sleeps as the dead —</l>
     <l n="50">Ended license , lust and play :</l>
     <l n="51">Why do you iron the night away ?</l>
     <l n="52">Your big clock speaks with a deadly sound ,</l>
     <l n="53">With a tick and a wail till dawn comes round .</l>
     <l n="54">While the monster shadows glower and creep ,</l>
     <l n="55">What can be better for man than sleep ? ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="56">“ I will tell you a secret , ” Chang replied ;</l>
     <l n="57">“ My breast with vision is satisfied ,</l>
     <l n="58">And I see green trees and fluttering wings ,</l>
     <l n="59">And my deathless bird from Shanghai sings . ”</l>
     <l n="60">Then he lit five fire-crackers in a pan .</l>
     <l n="61">“ Pop , pop , ” said the fire-crackers , “ cra-cra-crack . ”</l>
     <l n="62">He lit a joss stick long and black .</l>
     <l n="63">Then the proud gray joss in the corner stirred ;</l>
     <l n="64">On his wrist appeared a gray small bird ,</l>
     <l n="65">And this was the song of the gray small bird :</l>
     <l n="66">“ Where is the princess , loved forever ,</l>
     <l n="67">Who made Chang first of the kings of men ? ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="68">And the joss in the corner stirred again ;</l>
     <l n="69">And the carved dog , curled in his arms , awoke ,</l>
     <l n="70">Barked forth a smoke-cloud that whirled and broke .</l>
     <l n="71">It piled in a maze round the ironing-place ,</l>
     <l n="72">And there on the snowy table wide</l>
     <l n="73">Stood a Chinese lady of high degree ,</l>
     <l n="74">With a scornful , witching , tea-rose face ....</l>
     <l n="75">Yet she put away all form and pride ,</l>
     <l n="76">And laid her glimmering veil aside</l>
     <l n="77">With a childlike smile for Chang and for me .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="78">The walls fell back , night was aflower ,</l>
     <l n="79">The table gleamed in a moonlit bower ,</l>
     <l n="80">While Chang , with a countenance carved of stone ,</l>
     <l n="81">Ironed and ironed , all alone .</l>
     <l n="82">And thus she sang to the busy man Chang :</l>
     <l n="83">“ Have you forgotten ....</l>
     <l n="84">Deep in the ages , long , long ago ,</l>
     <l n="85">I was your sweetheart , there on the sand —</l>
     <l n="86">Storm-worn beach of the Chinese land ?</l>
     <l n="87">We sold our grain in the peacock town</l>
     <l n="88">Built on the edge of the sea-sands brown —</l>
     <l n="89">Built on the edge of the sea-sands brown ....</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="19">
     <l n="90">“ When all the world was drinking blood</l>
     <l n="91">From the skulls of men and bulls</l>
     <l n="92">And all the world had swords and clubs of stone ,</l>
     <l n="93">We drank our tea in China beneath the sacred spice-trees ,</l>
     <l n="94">And heard the curled waves of the harbor moan .</l>
     <l n="95">And this gray bird , in Love 's first spring ,</l>
     <l n="96">With a bright-bronze breast and a bronze-brown wing ,</l>
     <l n="97">Captured the world with his carolling .</l>
     <l n="98">Do you remember , ages after ,</l>
     <l n="99">At last the world we were born to own ?</l>
     <l n="100">You were the heir of the yellow throne —</l>
     <l n="101">The world was the field of the Chinese man</l>
     <l n="102">And we were the pride of the Sons of Han ?</l>
     <l n="103">We copied deep books and we carved in jade ,</l>
     <l n="104">And wove blue silks in the mulberry shade .... ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="20">
     <l n="105">“ I remember , I remember</l>
     <l n="106">That Spring came on forever ,</l>
     <l n="107">That Spring came on forever , ”</l>
     <l n="108">Said the Chinese nightingale .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="21">
     <l n="109">My heart was filled with marvel and dream ,</l>
     <l n="110">Though I saw the western street-lamps gleam ,</l>
     <l n="111">Though dawn was bringing the western day ,</l>
     <l n="112">Though Chang was a laundryman ironing away ....</l>
     <l n="113">Mingled there with the streets and alleys ,</l>
     <l n="114">The railroad-yard and the clock-tower bright ,</l>
     <l n="115">Demon clouds crossed ancient valleys ;</l>
     <l n="116">Across wide lotus-ponds of light</l>
     <l n="117">I marked a giant firefly 's flight .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="22">
     <l n="118">And the lady , rosy-red ,</l>
     <l n="119">Flourished her fan , her shimmering fan ,</l>
     <l n="120">Stretched her hand toward Chang , and said :</l>
     <l n="121">“ Do you remember ,</l>
     <l n="122">Ages after ,</l>
     <l n="123">Our palace of heart-red stone ?</l>
     <l n="124">Do you remember</l>
     <l n="125">The little doll-faced children</l>
     <l n="126">With their lanterns full of moon-fire ,</l>
     <l n="127">That came from all the empire</l>
     <l n="128">Honoring the throne ?—</l>
     <l n="129">The loveliest fête and carnival</l>
     <l n="130">Our world had ever known ?</l>
     <l n="131">The sages sat about us</l>
     <l n="132">With their heads bowed in their beards ,</l>
     <l n="133">With proper meditation on the sight .</l>
     <l n="134">Confucius was not born ;</l>
     <l n="135">We lived in those great days</l>
     <l n="136">Confucius later said were lived aright ....</l>
     <l n="137">And this gray bird , on that day of spring ,</l>
     <l n="138">With a bright bronze breast , and a bronze-brown wing ,</l>
     <l n="139">Captured the world with his carolling .</l>
     <l n="140">Late at night his tune was spent .</l>
     <l n="141">Peasants ,</l>
     <l n="142">Sages ,</l>
     <l n="143">Children ,</l>
     <l n="144">Homeward went ,</l>
     <l n="145">And then the bronze bird sang for you and me .</l>
     <l n="146">We walked alone . Our hearts were high and free .</l>
     <l n="147">I had a silvery name , I had a silvery name ,</l>
     <l n="148">I had a silvery name — do you remember</l>
     <l n="149">The name you cried beside the tumbling sea ? ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="23">
     <l n="150">Chang turned not to the lady slim —</l>
     <l n="151">He bent to his work , ironing away ;</l>
     <l n="152">But she was arch , and knowing and glowing ,</l>
     <l n="153">And the bird on his shoulder spoke for him .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="24">
     <l n="154">“ Darling ... darling ... darling ... darling ... ”</l>
     <l n="155">Said the Chinese nightingale .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="25">
     <l n="156">The great gray joss on a rustic shelf ,</l>
     <l n="157">Rakish and shrewd , with his collar awry ,</l>
     <l n="158">Sang impolitely , as though by himself ,</l>
     <l n="159">Drowning with his bellowing the nightingale 's cry :</l>
     <l n="160">“ Back through a hundred , hundred years</l>
     <l n="161">Hear the waves as they climb the piers ,</l>
     <l n="162">Hear the howl of the silver seas ,</l>
     <l n="163">Hear the thunder .</l>
     <l n="164">Hear the gongs of holy China</l>
     <l n="165">How the waves and tunes combine</l>
     <l n="166">In a rhythmic clashing wonder ,</l>
     <l n="167">Incantation old and fine :</l>
     <l n="168">‘ Dragons , dragons , Chinese dragons ,</l>
     <l n="169">Red fire-crackers , and green fire-crackers ,</l>
     <l n="170">And dragons , dragons , Chinese dragons . ’ ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="26">
     <l n="171">Then the lady , rosy-red ,</l>
     <l n="172">Turned to her lover Chang and said :</l>
     <l n="173">“ Dare you forget that turquoise dawn</l>
     <l n="174">When we stood in our mist-hung velvet lawn ,</l>
     <l n="175">And worked a spell this great joss taught</l>
     <l n="176">Till a God of the Dragons was charmed and caught ?</l>
     <l n="177">From the flag high over our palace home</l>
     <l n="178">He flew to our feet in rainbow-foam —</l>
     <l n="179">A king of beauty and tempest and thunder</l>
     <l n="180">Panting to tear our sorrows asunder .</l>
     <l n="181">A dragon of fair adventure and wonder .</l>
     <l n="182">We mounted the back of that royal slave</l>
     <l n="183">With thoughts of desire that were noble and grave .</l>
     <l n="184">We swam down the shore to the dragon-mountains ,</l>
     <l n="185">We whirled to the peaks and the fiery fountains .</l>
     <l n="186">To our secret ivory house we were bourne .</l>
     <l n="187">We looked down the wonderful wing-filled regions</l>
     <l n="188">Where the dragons darted in glimmering legions .</l>
     <l n="189">Right by my breast the nightingale sang ;</l>
     <l n="190">The old rhymes rang in the sunlit mist</l>
     <l n="191">That we this hour regain —</l>
     <l n="192">Song-fire for the brain .</l>
     <l n="193">When my hands and my hair and my feet you kissed ,</l>
     <l n="194">When you cried for your heart 's new pain ,</l>
     <l n="195">What was my name in the dragon-mist ,</l>
     <l n="196">In the rings of rainbowed rain ? ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="27">
     <l n="197">“ Sorrow and love , glory and love , ”</l>
     <l n="198">Said the Chinese nightingale .</l>
     <l n="199">“ Sorrow and love , glory and love , ”</l>
     <l n="200">Said the Chinese nightingale .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="28">
     <l n="201">And now the joss broke in with his song :</l>
     <l n="202">“ Dying ember , bird of Chang ,</l>
     <l n="203">Soul of Chang , do you remember ?—</l>
     <l n="204">Ere you returned to the shining harbor</l>
     <l n="205">There were pirates by ten thousand</l>
     <l n="206">Descended on the town</l>
     <l n="207">In vessels mountain-high and red and brown ,</l>
     <l n="208">Moon-ships that climbed the storms and cut the skies .</l>
     <l n="209">On their prows were painted terrible bright eyes .</l>
     <l n="210">But I was then a wizard and a scholar and a priest ;</l>
     <l n="211">I stood upon the sand ;</l>
     <l n="212">With lifted hand I looked upon them</l>
     <l n="213">And sunk their vessels with my wizard eyes ,</l>
     <l n="214">And the stately lacquer-gate made safe again .</l>
     <l n="215">Deep , deep below the bay , the sea-weed and the spray ,</l>
     <l n="216">Embalmed in amber every pirate lies ,</l>
     <l n="217">Embalmed in amber every pirate lies . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="29">
     <l n="218">Then this did the noble lady say :</l>
     <l n="219">“ Bird , do you dream of our home-coming day</l>
     <l n="220">When you flew like a courier on before</l>
     <l n="221">From the dragon-peak to our palace-door ,</l>
     <l n="222">And we drove the steed in your singing path —</l>
     <l n="223">The ramping dragon of laughter and wrath :</l>
     <l n="224">And found our city all aglow ,</l>
     <l n="225">And knighted this joss that decked it so ?</l>
     <l n="226">There were golden fishes in the purple river</l>
     <l n="227">And silver fishes and rainbow fishes .</l>
     <l n="228">There were golden junks in the laughing river ,</l>
     <l n="229">And silver junks and rainbow junks :</l>
     <l n="230">There were golden lilies by the bay and river ,</l>
     <l n="231">And silver lilies and tiger-lilies ,</l>
     <l n="232">And tinkling wind-bells in the gardens of the town</l>
     <l n="233">By the black-lacquer gate</l>
     <l n="234">Where walked in state</l>
     <l n="235">The kind king Chang</l>
     <l n="236">And his sweet-heart mate ....</l>
     <l n="237">With his flag-born dragon</l>
     <l n="238">And his crown of pearl ... and ... jade ,</l>
     <l n="239">And his nightingale reigning in the mulberry shade ,</l>
     <l n="240">And sailors and soldiers on the sea-sands brown ,</l>
     <l n="241">And priests who bowed them down to your song —</l>
     <l n="242">By the city called Han , the peacock town ,</l>
     <l n="243">By the city called Han , the nightingale town ,</l>
     <l n="244">The nightingale town . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="30">

   <p>I opened the ink-well and smoke filled the room . The smoke formed the giant frog-cat of my doom . His web feet left dreadful slime tracks on the floor . He had hammer and nails that he laid by the door . He sprawled on the table , claw-hands in my hair . He looked through my heart to the mud that was there . Like a black-mailer hating his victim he spoke : “ When I see all your squirming I laugh till I choke Singing of peace . Railing at battle . Soothing a handful with saccharine prattle . All the millions of earth have voted for fight . You are voting for talk , with hands lily white . ” He leaped to the floor , then grew seven feet high , Beautiful , terrible , scorn in his eye : The Devil Eternal , Apollo grown old , With beard of bright silver and garments of gold . “ What will you do to end war for good ? Will you stand by the book-case , be nailed to the wood ? ” I stretched out my arms . He drove the nails deep , Silently , coolly . The house was asleep , I hung for three years , forbidden to die . I seemed but a shadow the servants passed by . At the end of the time with hot irons he returned . “ The Quitter Sublime ” on my bosom he burned . As he seared me he hissed : “ You are wearing away . The good angels tell me you leave them today . You want to come down from the nails in the door . The victor must hang there three hundred years more . If any prig-saint would outvote all mankind He must use an immortally resolute mind . Think what the saints of Benares endure , Through infinite birthpangs their courage is sure . Self-tortured , self-ruled , they build their powers high , Until they are gods , overmaster the sky . ” Then he pulled out the nails . He shouted “ Come in . ” To heal me there stepped in a lady of sin . Her hand was in mine . We walked in the sun . She said : “ Now forget them , the Saxon and Hun . You are dreary and aged and silly and weak . Let us smell the sweet groves . Let the summertime speak . ” We walked to the river . We swam there in state . I was a serpent . She was my mate . I forgot in the marsh , as I tumbled about , That trial in my room , where I did not hold out . Since I was a serpent , my mate seemed to me As a mermaiden seems to a fisher at sea , Or a whisky soaked girl to a whisky soaked king . I woke . She had turned to a ravening thing On the table — a buzzard with leperous head . She tore up my rhymes and my drawings . She said : “ I am your own cheap bankrupt soul . Will you die for the nations , making them whole ? We joy in the swamp and here we are gay . WILL YOU BRING YOUR FINE PEACE TO THE NATIONS TODAY ? ”</p>

      <l n="535">An Account of the Poem Games</l>
     </lg>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>In the summer of 1916 in the parlor of Mrs. William Vaughn Moody ; and in the following winter in the Chicago Little Theatre , under the auspices of Poetry , A Magazine of Verse ; and in Mandel Hall , the University of Chicago , under the auspices of the Senior Class ,— these Poem Games were presented . Miss Eleanor Dougherty was the dancer throughout. The entire undertaking developed through the generous coöperation and advice of Mrs. William Vaughn Moody . The writer is exceedingly grateful to Mrs. Moody and all concerned for making place for the idea . Now comes the test of its vitality . Can it go on in the absence of its initiators ?</p>
   <p>Mr. Lewellyn Jones , of the Chicago Evening Post , announced the affair as a “ rhythmic picnic ” . Mr. Maurice Browne of the Chicago Little Theatre said Miss Dougherty was at the beginning of the old Greek Tragic Dance . Somewhere between lies the accomplishment .</p>
   <p>In the Congo volume , as is indicated in the margins , the meaning of a few of the verses is aided by chanting . In the Poem Games the English word is still first in importance , the dancer comes second , the chanter third . The marginal directions of King Solomon indicate the spirit in which all the pantomime was developed . Miss Dougherty designed her own costumes , and worked out her own stage business for King Solomon , The Potatoes ’ Dance , The King of Yellow Butterflies and Aladdin and the Jinn ( The Congo , page 140 ) . In the last , “ ‘ I am your slave , ’ said the Jinn ” was repeated four times at the end of each stanza .</p>
   <p>The Poem Game idea was first indorsed in the Wellesley kindergarten , by the children . They improvised pantomime and dance for the Potatoes ’ Dance , while the writer chanted it , and while Professor Hamilton C. Macdougall of the Wellesley musical department followed on the piano the outline of the jingle . Later Professor Macdougall very kindly wrote down his piano rendition . A study of this transcript helps to confirm the idea that when the cadences of a bit of verse are a little exaggerated , they are tunes , yet of a truth they are tunes which can be but vaguely recorded by notation or expressed by an instrument . The author of this book is now against instrumental music in this type of work . It blurs the English .</p>
   <p>Professor Macdougall has in various conversations helped the author toward a Poem Game theory . He agrees that neither the dancing nor the chanting nor any other thing should be allowed to run away with the original intention of the words . The chanting should not be carried to the point where it seeks to rival conventional musical composition . The dancer should be subordinated to the natural rhythms of English speech , and not attempt to incorporate bodily all the precedents of professional dancing .</p>
   <p>Speaking generally , poetic ideas can be conveyed word by word , faster than musical feeling . The repetitions in the Poem Games are to keep the singing , the dancing and the ideas at one pace . The repetitions may be varied according to the necessities of the individual dancer . Dancing is slower than poetry and faster than music in developing the same thoughts . In folk dances and vaudeville , the verse , music , and dancing are on so simple a basis the time elements can be easily combined . Likewise the rhythms and the other elements .</p>
   <p>Miss Dougherty is particularly illustrative in her pantomime , but there were many verses she looked over and rejected because they could not be rendered without blurring the original intent . Possibly every poem in the world has its dancer somewhere waiting , who can dance but that one poem . Certainly those poems would be most successful in games , where the tone color is so close to the meaning that any exaggeration of that color by dancing and chanting only makes the story clearer . The writer would like to see some one try Dryden 's Alexander 's Feast , or Swinburne 's Atalanta in Calydon . Certainly in those poems the decorative rhythm and the meaning are absolutely one .</p>
   <p>With no dancing evolutions , the author of this book has chanted John Brown and King Solomon for the last two years for many audiences . It took but a minute to teach the people the responses . As a rule they had no advance notice they were going to sing . The versifier sang the parts of the King and Queen in turn , and found each audience perfectly willing to be the oxen , the sweethearts , the swans , the sons , the shepherds , etc .</p>
   <p>A year ago the writer had the honor of chanting for the Florence Fleming Noyes school of dancers . In one short evening they made the first section of the Congo into an incantation , the King Solomon into an extraordinarily graceful series of tableaus , and the Potatoes ’ Dance into a veritable whirlwind . Later came the more elaborately prepared Chicago experiment .</p>
   <p>In the King of Yellow Butterflies and the Potatoes ’ Dance Miss Dougherty occupied the entire eye of the audience and interpreted , while the versifier chanted the poems as a semi-invisible orchestra , by the side of the curtain . For Aladdin and for King Solomon Miss Dougherty and the writer divided the stage between them , but the author was little more than the orchestra . The main intention was carried out , which was to combine the work of the dancer with the words of the production and the responses of the audience .</p>
   <p>The present rhymer has no ambitions as a stage manager . The Poem Game idea , in its rhythmic picnic stage , is recommended to amateurs , its further development to be on their own initiative . Informal parties might divide into groups of dancers and groups of chanters . The whole might be worked out in the spirit in which children play King William was King James ’ Son , London Bridge , or As We Go Round the Mulberry Bush . And the author of this book would certainly welcome the tragic dance , if Miss Dougherty will gather a company about her and go forward , using any acceptable poems , new or old . Swinburne 's Atalanta in Calydon is perhaps the most literal and rhythmic example of the idea we have in English , though it may not be available when tried out .</p>
   <p>The main revolution necessary for dancing improvisers , who would go a longer way with the Poem Game idea , is to shake off the Isadora Duncan and the Russian precedents for a while , and abolish the orchestra and piano , replacing all these with the natural meaning and cadences of English speech . The work would come closer to acting , than dancing is now conceived .</p>

   </lg>
   <p>Legree 's big house was white and green . His cotton-fields were the best to be seen . He had strong horses and opulent cattle , And bloodhounds bold , with chains that would rattle . His garret was full of curious things : Books of magic , bags of gold , And rabbits ’ feet on long twine strings . BUT HE WENT DOWN TO THE DEVIL .</p>
   <p>Legree he sported a brass-buttoned coat , A snake-skin necktie , a blood-red shirt . Legree he had a beard like a goat , And a thick hairy neck , and eyes like dirt . His puffed-out cheeks were fish-belly white , He had great long teeth , and an appetite . He ate raw meat , ‘ most every meal , And rolled his eyes till the cat would squeal . His fist was an enormous size To mash poor niggers that told him lies : He was surely a witch-man in disguise . BUT HE WENT DOWN TO THE DEVIL .</p>
   <p>He wore hip-boots , and would wade all day To capture his slaves that had fled away . BUT HE WENT DOWN TO THE DEVIL .</p>
   <p>He beat poor Uncle Tom to death Who prayed for Legree with his last breath . Then Uncle Tom to Eva flew , To the high sanctoriums bright and new ; And Simon Legree stared up beneath , And cracked his heels , and ground his teeth : AND WENT DOWN TO THE DEVIL .</p>
   <p>He crossed the yard in the storm and gloom ; He went into his grand front room . He said , “ I killed him , and I do n't care . ” He kicked a hound , he gave a swear ; He tightened his belt , he took a lamp , Went down cellar to the webs and damp . There in the middle of the mouldy floor He heaved up a slab , he found a door — AND WENT DOWN TO THE DEVIL .</p>
   <p>His lamp blew out , but his eyes burned bright . Simon Legree stepped down all night — DOWN , DOWN TO THE DEVIL . Simon Legree he reached the place , He saw one half of the human race , He saw the Devil on a wide green throne , Gnawing the meat from a big ham-bone , And he said to Mister Devil :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ I see that you have much to eat —</l>
     <l n="2">A red ham-bone is surely sweet .</l>
     <l n="3">I see that you have lion 's feet ;</l>
     <l n="4">I see your frame is fat and fine ,</l>
     <l n="5">I see you drink your poison wine —</l>
     <l n="6">Blood and burning turpentine . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>And the Devil said to Simon Legree : “ I like your style , so wicked and free . Come sit and share my throne with me , And let us bark and revel . ” And there they sit and gnash their teeth , And each one wears a hop-vine wreath . They are matching pennies and shooting craps , They are playing poker and taking naps . And old Legree is fat and fine : He eats the fire , he drinks the wine — Blood and burning turpentine — DOWN , DOWN WITH THE DEVIL ; DOWN , DOWN WITH THE DEVIL ; DOWN , DOWN WITH THE DEVIL .</p>

   <p>I 've been to Palestine . WHAT DID YOU SEE IN PALESTINE ? I saw the ark of Noah — It was made of pitch and pine . I saw old Father Noah Asleep beneath his vine . I saw Shem , Ham and Japhet Standing in a line . I saw the tower of Babel In the gorgeous sunrise shine — By a weeping willow tree Beside the Dead Sea .</p>
   <p>I 've been to Palestine . WHAT DID YOU SEE IN PALESTINE ? I saw abominations And Gadarene swine . I saw the sinful Canaanites Upon the shewbread dine , And spoil the temple vessels And drink the temple wine . I saw Lot 's wife , a pillar of salt Standing in the brine — By a weeping willow tree Beside the Dead Sea .</p>
   <p>I 've been to Palestine . WHAT DID YOU SEE IN PALESTINE ? Cedars on Mount Lebanon , Gold in Ophir 's mine , And a wicked generation Seeking for a sign And Baal 's howling worshippers Their god with leaves entwine . And ... I saw the war-horse ramping And shake his forelock fine — By a weeping willow tree Beside the Dead Sea .</p>
   <p>I 've been to Palestine . WHAT DID YOU SEE IN PALESTINE ? Old John Brown . Old John Brown . I saw his gracious wife Dressed in a homespun gown . I saw his seven sons Before his feet bow down . And he marched with his seven sons , His wagons and goods and guns , To his campfire by the sea , By the waves of Galilee .</p>
   <p>I 've been to Palestine . WHAT DID YOU SEE IN PALESTINE ? I saw the harp and psalt'ry Played for Old John Brown . I heard the ram 's horn blow , Blow for Old John Brown . I saw the Bulls of Bashan — They cheered for Old John Brown . I saw the big Behemoth — He cheered for Old John Brown . I saw the big Leviathan — He cheered for Old John Brown . I saw the Angel Gabriel Great power to him assign . I saw him fight the Canaanites And set God 's Israel free . I saw him when the war was done In his rustic chair recline — By his campfire by the sea , By the waves of Galilee .</p>
   <p>I 've been to Palestine . WHAT DID YOU SEE IN PALESTINE ? Old John Brown . Old John Brown . And there he sits To judge the world . His hunting-dogs At his feet are curled . His eyes half-closed , But John Brown sees The ends of the earth , The Day of Doom . And his shot-gun lies Across his knees — Old John Brown , Old John Brown .</p>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">“ The Handy Guide for Beggars ” is an introduction to all Vachel Lindsay 's</l>
     <l n="4">work . It gives his first adventures afoot . He walked through Florida ,</l>
     <l n="5">Georgia , North Carolina , Tennessee , and Kentucky , in the spring of 1906 .</l>
     <l n="6">He walked through New Jersey , Pennsylvania , and on to Hiram , Ohio ,</l>
     <l n="7">in the spring of 1908 . He carried on these trips his poems :</l>
     <l n="8">“ The Tree of Laughing Bells ” , “ The Heroes of Time ” , etc .</l>
     <l n="9">He recited them in exchange for food and lodging . He left copies</l>
     <l n="10">for those who appeared interested . The book is a record of these</l>
     <l n="11">journeys , and of many pleasing discoveries about American Democracy .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>This book serves to introduce the next , “ Adventures While Preaching the Gospel of Beauty ” . In the spring and summer of 1912 , Mr. Lindsay walked from Springfield , Illinois , west to Colorado , and into New Mexico . He was much more experienced in the road . He carried “ Rhymes to Be Traded for Bread ” , “ The Village Improvement Parade ” , etc . As is indicated in the title , he wrestled with a theory of American aesthetics . “ Christmas , 1915 ” , the third book in the series , appeared , applying the “ Gospel of Beauty to the Photoplay ” . The ideas of Art and Democracy that develop in the first two books are used as the basic principles in “ The Art of the Moving Picture ” . Those who desire a close view of the Lindsay idea will do well to read the three works in the order named . Further particulars in the pages following .</p>

   <p>In the readings which Vachel Lindsay has given for colleges , universities , etc ., throughout the country , he has won the approbation of the critics and of his audiences in general for the new verse-form which he is employing , as well as the manner of his chanting and singing , which is peculiarly his own . He carries in memory all the poems in his books , and recites the program made out for him ; the wonderful effect of sound produced by his lines , their relation to the idea which the author seeks to convey , and their marvelous lyrical quality are quite beyond the ordinary , and suggest new possibilities and new meanings in poetry . It is his main object to give his already established friends a deeper sense of the musical intention of his pieces .</p>

   <p>Vachel Lindsay took a walk from his home in Springfield , Ill ., over the prairies to New Mexico . He was in Kansas in wheat-harvest time and he worked as a farmhand , and he tells all about that . He tells about his walks and the people he met in a little book , “ Adventures While Preaching the Gospel of Beauty ” .</p>
   <p>For the conditions of his tramps were that he should keep away from cities , money , baggage , and pay his way by reciting his own poems . And he did it . People liked his pieces , and tramp farmhands with rough necks and rougher hands left off singing smutty limericks and took to “ Atalanta in Calydon ” apparently because they preferred it . Of motor cars , which gave him a lift , he says : “ I still maintain that the auto is a carnal institution , to be shunned by the truly spiritual , but there are times when I , for one , get tired of being spiritual . ” His story of the “ Five Little Children Eating Mush ” ( that was one night in Colorado , and he recited to them while they ate supper ) has more beauty and tenderness and jolly tears than all the expensive sob stuff theatrical managers ever dreamed of . Mr. Lindsay does n't need to write verse to be a poet . His prose is poetry — poetry straight from the soil , of America that is , and of a nobler America that is to be . You cannot afford — both for your entertainment and for the REAL IDEA that this young man has ( of which we have said nothing ) — to miss this book .— Editorial from ‘ Collier 's Weekly ’ .</p>
