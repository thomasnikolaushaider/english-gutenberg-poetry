     <l n="2">When the War is over , Charley ,</l>
     <l n="3">We 'll go fishing once again .</l>
     <l n="4">You 'll be a new man , Charley ,</l>
     <l n="5">When you walk with fishermen .</l>
     <l n="6">For we 'll seek a leaping river</l>
     <l n="7">I know far among the fells ;</l>
     <l n="8">You 'll forget the War there , Charley ,</l>
     <l n="9">Where the springing water wells .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="10">It 's God 's own land for the nimble trout ,</l>
     <l n="11">And ferns and waving flowers ,</l>
     <l n="12">The bracken and the bilberry ,</l>
     <l n="13">And the ash the coral dowers .</l>
     <l n="14">There are rolling leagues of heather ,</l>
     <l n="15">Lone hills where the plovers call .</l>
     <l n="16">Oh , we 'll climb those hills together</l>
     <l n="17">Ere the last dews fall !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="18">And we 'll talk to the wild creatures</l>
     <l n="19">In the crannies of the moors ;</l>
     <l n="20">Oh , our hearts will mount to Heaven</l>
     <l n="21">When the merry lark soars !</l>
     <l n="22">All our days will shine with gladness ,</l>
     <l n="23">All our nights with calm repose .</l>
     <l n="24">And we 'll throw a fly together</l>
     <l n="25">Where the rushing stream flows .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="26">Nature has been to me lately</l>
     <l n="27">As a fair and radiant bride ,</l>
     <l n="28">She has drawn me with strange gentleness</l>
     <l n="29">To the hollow of her side .</l>
     <l n="30">She has gone forth like a warrior</l>
     <l n="31">With pricking glaive and spear ,</l>
     <l n="32">And Grief has quailed in his ambush</l>
     <l n="33">When her flashing arms drew near .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="34">I never loved sweet England</l>
     <l n="35">Till she kissed me in the West ,</l>
     <l n="36">The sun upon her shining brows</l>
     <l n="37">And the purple on her breast ,</l>
     <l n="38">Breathing songs of low compassion</l>
     <l n="39">To my spirit as it cried ,</l>
     <l n="40">When I mourned that sinning country</l>
     <l n="41">Which had thrust me from her side .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="42">All the wooded hills of the Eifel ,</l>
     <l n="43">All the vine-bergs of the Rhine ,</l>
     <l n="44">All the glimmering strands of the Baltic ,</l>
     <l n="45">All the Brocken black with pine ,</l>
     <l n="46">Hold no tenderness of Beauty ,</l>
     <l n="47">( Beauty in the spirit dwells ,)</l>
     <l n="48">Such as smiles from one sweet valley</l>
     <l n="49">Darkling ‘ mid the Western fells .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="50">Do you remember , old fellow ,</l>
     <l n="51">When we fished near Altenahr ,</l>
     <l n="52">Where the red wine was flowing</l>
     <l n="53">And the bowl flashed a star ?</l>
     <l n="54">Do you remember the big schutzmann ,</l>
     <l n="55">With his sword by his side ,</l>
     <l n="56">Who guessed that you were poaching ,</l>
     <l n="57">And scared you off to hide ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="58">Oh , if he 'd only known , Charley ,</l>
     <l n="59">When you sought the bridge 's cover</l>
     <l n="60">That you 'd join the British Army</l>
     <l n="61">And go killing of his brother ,</l>
     <l n="62">He 'd have searched bank and vineyard</l>
     <l n="63">For a poacher of such worth ,</l>
     <l n="64">And put you in a prison cell</l>
     <l n="65">To cool your summer 's mirth .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="66">And do you remember the old inn</l>
     <l n="67">With the blue saint above the door ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>—</l>
     <l n="68">Simon Peter , who looked longingly</l>
     <l n="69">Upon our speckled store ?—</l>
     <l n="70">He who loves all careless fishers</l>
     <l n="71">Of the river and the sea ,</l>
     <l n="72">And prays that God shall save them</l>
     <l n="73">With his mates of Galilee .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="74">And what a wild night we had</l>
     <l n="75">When we rode home again !</l>
     <l n="76">For the students were all dancing</l>
     <l n="77">And singing in the train ;</l>
     <l n="78">And a tall man twanged a banjo</l>
     <l n="79">Till he fairly gave us fits ;</l>
     <l n="80">And a porter ran up swearing ,</l>
     <l n="81">And the banjo flew to bits .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="82">We were all drunk as blazes ,</l>
     <l n="83">Full of wine to burst .</l>
     <l n="84">But , by the sober lads of England ,</l>
     <l n="85">Those Germans were the worst .</l>
     <l n="86">They were singing and dancing ,</l>
     <l n="87">And shouting with delight ;</l>
     <l n="88">And the carriage rocked with laughter</l>
     <l n="89">As we rushed into the night .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="90">They are all dead now , Charley ;</l>
     <l n="91">They were merry fellows then .</l>
     <l n="92">They are dust and scattered ashes</l>
     <l n="93">Washed by the rain .</l>
     <l n="94">They are crying in the darkness</l>
     <l n="95">Where a grayer planet spins .</l>
     <l n="96">But the Lord is kind to fishers</l>
     <l n="97">And has spared us in our sins .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="98">Oh , the Lord is kind to fishers</l>
     <l n="99">Of the river and the sea</l>
     <l n="100">For the sake of Simon Peter</l>
     <l n="101">And the lads of Galilee !</l>
     <l n="102">For the sake of Simon Peter ,</l>
     <l n="103">Who so gladly would us shrive ,</l>
     <l n="104">We are walking in the sunlight ,</l>
     <l n="105">We are breathing and alive .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="106">And when the War is over</l>
     <l n="107">We 'll fish awhile together ,</l>
     <l n="108">We 'll climb the Western mountains ,</l>
     <l n="109">And walk the Western heather ,</l>
     <l n="110">And the curlew and the wild grouse</l>
     <l n="111">Will wake the vales with crying ,</l>
     <l n="112">And their soft rushing pinions</l>
     <l n="113">Will tremble by us , sighing .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="114">All the dead shepherds</l>
     <l n="115">Will hear them in their rest .</l>
     <l n="116">But you must n't heed dead shepherds</l>
     <l n="117">When you 're fishing in the West ;</l>
     <l n="118">You must n't heed the lonely men</l>
     <l n="119">Who neither sing nor dance ,</l>
     <l n="120">There 'll be always ghosts there , Charley ,</l>
     <l n="121">When the wind beats up from France .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="122">It 's the holy peace and quiet</l>
     <l n="123">Breathing from the Western skies</l>
     <l n="124">Which bring the stricken soul its rest</l>
     <l n="125">And still the heart 's wild cries .</l>
     <l n="126">If I had n't turned for healing</l>
     <l n="127">Where the moor to Heaven swells ,</l>
     <l n="128">I 'd have been a dead man , listening</l>
     <l n="129">To the mourning of the bells .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="130">If God had n't sent me healing</l>

     <l n="133">With the things that I 'm oppressed .</l>
     <l n="134">All my mad , merry comrades</l>
     <l n="135">Of drink , and fight , and lust ,</l>
     <l n="136">Are trodden into bloody clay</l>
     <l n="137">And blowing with the dust .</l>

     <l n="138">Some marched away with Hindenburg ,</l>

     <l n="141">With the devil 's cards for luck .</l>
     <l n="142">All my dreams went with them ,</l>
     <l n="143">All the dreams my land denied ;</l>
     <l n="144">But they 're smoke and drifting wreckage now</l>
     <l n="145">On the War 's wild tide .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="20">
     <l n="146">It was years since I left England ,—</l>
     <l n="147">Almost singing to depart ,—</l>
     <l n="148">She had cast a net about me ,</l>
     <l n="149">And thrust a dagger in my heart .</l>
     <l n="150">But another country smiled to me</l>
     <l n="151">And made me quiet nooks ,</l>
     <l n="152">Where men crushed for me the grapes of joy ,</l>
     <l n="153">And talked to me of books .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="21">
     <l n="154">She was a kind land to me once , Charley ,</l>
     <l n="155">I had real joy in her once ;</l>
     <l n="156">Her folk loved Shakespeare and Byron ,</l>
     <l n="157">Shunned no dreamer for a dunce .</l>
     <l n="158">They sang old folk songs , noble opera ;</l>
     <l n="159">Read Anglo-Saxon , old quaint sweets ;</l>
     <l n="160">And there were no starved souls in her temples ,</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="22">
     <l n="162">But a hand ever cut my Heaven</l>
     <l n="163">With the sharpness of a sword ,</l>
     <l n="164">There was the very riot of gladness ,</l>
     <l n="165">Reckless squander of Joy 's hoard ;</l>
     <l n="166">Lechery and sad Corruption</l>
     <l n="167">Danced in clinging robes of Light ;</l>
     <l n="168">Beauty smiled in the arms of Terror</l>
     <l n="169">And diced with the minions of Night .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="23">
     <l n="170">And you sprang to England 's banner , comrade ,</l>
     <l n="171">With glad praises on your lips ,</l>

     <l n="173">And the thunder of her ships .</l>
     <l n="174">But a sword broods in the darkness</l>
     <l n="175">Whose sweep is the wind 's sway ,</l>
     <l n="176">And the dumb white ships of Heaven</l>

     <l n="178">The still white ships of Heaven</l>

     <l n="181">Are the dead men of the wars .</l>
     <l n="182">They reck not of the chilly seas</l>
     <l n="183">That wildly round them churn .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">We ranged the chessmen on the chequered deal .</l>

     <l n="14">I 've never played as on that fateful night ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="18">And then when he 'd six pieces , and I eight ,</l>

     <l n="20">And with a knight , a castle — unawares ,—</l>
     <l n="21">A bishop in a corner breathing prayers ,</l>
     <l n="22">He caught me tripping . “ Checkmate ! Smashed ! ” he said ,</l>
     <l n="23">And like a beaten Hun I stole to bed .</l>

   <note>A poet lay dead where two red frontiers meet ; And many birds fluttered about his feet . He had unfurled his last wild madrigal , And winds had borne it where the dead leaves fall . The thrush , May 's mottled elf , the minstrel , sang More harsh than was his wont . The blackbird rang Strange sobbing woodland bells . The finch so sweet Lay with glazed eye , and raised each shattered wing , And cried in sudden pain , but could not sing . The sparrow twittered , “ ‘ Tis dark under the eaves , And sad-eyed Margot sits at home and grieves . ” The lark said , “ God is angry in bright Heaven . I saw Him once ,— a great white fluttering bird With beautiful broad wings that oft are heard When the wind beats the blue nave of the skies . I saw Him perching high upon the moon With the most dreadful anguish in His eyes . He flaps His wings , and tries , and wildly tries ; But He can sing no longer . It is still in Heaven . It is still in forest and on hill . The green leaves wither , and the world grows chill . ” A SINN FEINER I once had the trustiest comrade — God grant he thinks kindly of me — And we always stood shoulder to shoulder When a tossing wind troubled Life 's sea . He was like the marsh fire in fair weather ; Though in foul , we made merry together . But his soul was knit to the whirlwind — The fen mists but shrouded the flame — And I knew not our friendship 's attachment Till the day that the whirlwind came , For I saw our lives broken asunder And watched him away with the thunder . Men said he consorted with traitors And marshalled the beasts of the sty . But I know that mere mischief makers Do n't joyfully go forth to die . And I 've lost a friend like a brother , And never I 'll know such another . THE FOREIGN LEGIONARY , 1911 He had just come out of prison , and he stood and scowled apart , The old lust ‘ neath his ragged coat , and the cold hate in his heart ; And he peered to right and left through the cruel sleet and rain , Then dived into the nearest street to rob and steal again . He lay wounded in the desert where the thirsty sand gleamed red , Arab spearmen thrusting at the dying and the dead ; He had left the shrunken ranks to save a comrade in the rear ; And he raised himself and cursed them ; and went down beneath a spear . He lies and stares at Heaven through a cloud of crows and kites ; While round him prowl the jackals in the lurid tropic nights . And he 'll slowly bleach to powder ‘ neath the sunlight 's livid scroll , — The man they chased from Europe whom the world denied a soul . THE MISSIONARY ( Freely adapted from a Foreign Tongue ) You speak of worlds with rainbow prospects vaulted . But not for these the service that I hoard . You know the sweet ; but I — the pure , exalted : My soul spreads wings to her exalted Lord . My sphere of lowly service is more spacious Than earthly masters and their tasks afford ; For gentle is my Lord , and very gracious : I serve with willing hands my gracious Lord . I know dark realms where no glad light is burning , Where Life meets Death , and bows beneath his sword ; But yet I fear not ; for He is discerning : I lean upon my wise , discerning Lord . And when I 'm stripped of all , requited latest , His kind “ Well Done ” my guerdon , my reward : Though yours be richer , yet my Lord 's the greatest . I follow Him — the mightiest , greatest Lord .
