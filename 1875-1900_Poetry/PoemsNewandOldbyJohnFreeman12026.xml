    <docTitle><titlePart>POEMS NEW AND OLD PRESS NOTICES Mr. Freeman 's landscapes have an individuality which entitles him to his own place as a poet of nature .... The appreciation of his lofty ardours , his desolate landscapes and his strange , though beautiful , rhythms and forms of verse , is not one which springs up instantly in the mind ; but once it has arisen it does not diminish .— New Statesman . I think that whatever limitations our age and our poetry may have , Mr. Freeman 's poetry , and much else that is now being written , will find in all succeeding generations readers to whom it will give companionship and comfort .— Mr . J. C. Squire , in Land and Water . This book must be read steadily through ; quotation can reveal little of its scope , its richness .... When a man , in poems that are clearly fragments of autobiography , thus surrenders to the world the life of his spirit , the beauty of what he writes is inseparable from its truth . Truth endures , and a prophet would have a sad foreboding of posterity if he did not believe that of this day 's poets Mr. Freeman will not be among the forgotten .— Times Literary Supplement . This rarefied air is something to which the reader must adjust himself ; but he finds the process of adjustment made easy by a peculiar fascination in the atmosphere which Mr. Freeman creates . If it is aloof from ordinary experience , it is by so much the more individual ; and in it there are to be found thrills and feelings , an understanding of a particular aspect of nature , which have not hitherto been reported in poetry — Westminster Gazette . POEMS NEW AND OLD By John Freeman</titlePart></docTitle>
    <docDate>London : Selwyn and Blount , Ltd. 21 , York Buildings , Adelphi , W. C. 2<date>1920</date>“ —— He still 'd All sounds in air ; and left so free mine ears That I might hear the music of the spheres , And all the angels singing out of heaven , Whose tunes were solemn , as to passion given . ” NOTE .</docDate>
    <docImprint>With the exception of two or three poems which have appeared in newspapers , or in an anthology entitled Twelve Poets , the verses in the first part of this volume have not hitherto been printed . The second part contains Memories of Childhood and Other Poems , and the third part retrieves many verses from Presage of Victory (<date>1916</date>) , Stone Trees (<date>1916</date>) , Fifty Poems (<date>1911</date>) and Twenty Poems (<date>1909</date>) . Chronological order has not been carefully observed , or avoided , in the arrangement of the third part , but the earlier pieces will easily be distinguished by those who may wish to distinguish them .</docImprint>

     <l n="1">Rose-bosom 'd and rose-limb 'd</l>
     <l n="2">With eyes of dazzling bright</l>
     <l n="3">Shakes Venus mid the twinèd boughs of the night ;</l>
     <l n="4">Rose-limb 'd , soft-stepping</l>
     <l n="5">From low bough to bough</l>
     <l n="6">Shaking the wide-hung starry fruitage — dimmed</l>
     <l n="7">Its bloom of snow</l>
     <l n="8">By that sole planetary glow .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">Venus , avers the astronomer ,</l>
     <l n="10">Not thus idly dancing goes</l>
     <l n="11">Flushing the eternal orchard with wild rose .</l>
     <l n="12">She through ether burns</l>
     <l n="13">Outpacing planetary earth ,</l>
     <l n="14">And ere two years triumphantly returns ,</l>
     <l n="15">And again wave-like swelling flows ,</l>
     <l n="16">And again her flashing apparition comes and goes .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="17">This we have not seen ,</l>
     <l n="18">No heavenly courses set ,</l>
     <l n="19">No flight unpausing through a void serene :</l>
     <l n="20">But when eve clears ,</l>
     <l n="21">Arises Venus as she first uprose</l>
     <l n="22">Stepping the shaken boughs among ,</l>
     <l n="23">And in her bosom glows</l>
     <l n="24">The warm light hidden in sunny snows .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="25">She shakes the clustered stars</l>
     <l n="26">Lightly , as she goes</l>
     <l n="27">Amid the unseen branches of the night ,</l>
     <l n="28">Rose-limb 'd , rose-bosom 'd bright .</l>
     <l n="29">She leaps : they shake and pale ; she glows —</l>
     <l n="30">And who but knows</l>
     <l n="31">How the rejoiced heart aches</l>
     <l n="32">When Venus all his starry vision shakes ;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="33">When through his mind</l>
     <l n="34">Tossing with random airs of an unearthly wind ,</l>
     <l n="35">Rose-bosom 'd , rose-limb 'd ,</l>
     <l n="36">The mistress of his starry vision arises ,</l>
     <l n="37">And the boughs glittering sway</l>
     <l n="38">And the stars pale away ,</l>
     <l n="39">And the enlarging heaven glows</l>
     <l n="40">As Venus light-foot mid the twinèd branches goes .</l>

     <l n="1">Hear me , O beeches ! You</l>
     <l n="2">That have with ageless anguish slowly risen</l>
     <l n="3">From earth 's still secret prison</l>
     <l n="4">Into the ampler prison of aery blue .</l>
     <l n="5">Your voice I hear , flowing the valleys through</l>
     <l n="6">After the wind that tramples from the west .</l>
     <l n="7">After the wind your boughs in new unrest</l>
     <l n="8">Shake , and your voice — one voice uniting voices</l>
     <l n="9">A thousand or a thousand thousand — flows</l>
     <l n="10">Like the wind 's moody ; glad when he rejoices</l>
     <l n="11">In swift-succeeding and diminishing blows ,</l>
     <l n="12">And drooping when declines death 's ardour in his breast ;</l>
     <l n="13">Then over him exhausted weaving the soft fan-like noises</l>
     <l n="14">Of gentlest creaking stems and soothing leaves</l>
     <l n="15">Until he rest ,</l>
     <l n="16">And silent too your easied bosom heaves .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="17">That high and noble wind is rootless nor</l>
     <l n="18">From stable earth sucks nurture , but roams on</l>
     <l n="19">Childless as fatherless , wild , unconfined ,</l>
     <l n="20">So that men say , “ As homeless as the wind ! ”</l>
     <l n="21">Rising and falling and rising evermore</l>
     <l n="22">With years like ticks , æons as centuries gone ;</l>
     <l n="23">Only within impalpable ether bound</l>
     <l n="24">And blindly with the green globe spinning round .</l>
     <l n="25">He , noble wind ,</l>
     <l n="26">Most ancient creature of imprisoned Time ,</l>
     <l n="27">From high to low may fall , and low to high may climb ,</l>
     <l n="28">Andean peak to deep-caved southern sea ,</l>
     <l n="29">With lifted hand and voice of gathered sound ,</l>
     <l n="30">And echoes in his tossing quiver bound</l>
     <l n="31">And loosed from height into immensity ;</l>
     <l n="32">Yet of his freedom tires , remaining free .</l>
     <l n="33">— Moulding and remoulding imponderable cloud ,</l>
     <l n="34">Uplifting skiey archipelagian isles</l>
     <l n="35">Sunnier than ocean 's , blue seas and white isles</l>
     <l n="36">Aflush with blossom where late sunlight glowed ;—</l>
     <l n="37">Still of his freedom tiring yet still free ,</l>
     <l n="38">Homelessly roaming between sky , earth and sea .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="39">But you , O beeches , even as men , have root</l>

     <l n="41">Earth , sun , air , water , and the chemic fruit</l>
     <l n="42">Wise Time of these has made . What laughing Springs</l>
     <l n="43">Your branches sprinkle young leaf-shadows o'er</l>
     <l n="44">That wanting the leaf-shadows were no Springs</l>
     <l n="45">Of seasonable sweet and freshness ! nor</l>
     <l n="46">If Summer of your murmur gathered not</l>
     <l n="47">Increase of music as your leaves grow dense ,</l>
     <l n="48">Might even kine and birds and general noise of wings</l>
     <l n="49">Of summer make full Summer , but the hot</l>
     <l n="50">Slow moons would pass and leave unsatisfied the sense .</l>
     <l n="51">Nor Autumn 's waste were dear if your gold snow</l>
     <l n="52">Of leaves whirled not upon the gold below ;</l>
     <l n="53">Nor Winter 's snow were loveliness complete</l>
     <l n="54">Wanting the white drifts round your breasts and feet .</l>

    <head>THE FIRST HOUSE</head>
     <l n="1">That is the earliest thing that I remember —</l>
     <l n="2">The narrow house in the long narrow street ,</l>
     <l n="3">Dark rooms within and darkness out of doors</l>
     <l n="4">Where grasses in the garden lift in the wind ,</l>
     <l n="5">Long grasses clinging round unsteady feet .</l>
     <l n="6">The sunlight through one narrow passage pours ,</l>
     <l n="7">As through the keyhole into a dusty room ,</l>
     <l n="8">Striking with a golden rod the greening gloom .</l>
     <l n="9">The tall , tall timber-stacks have yet been kind ,</l>
     <l n="10">Letting the sun fling his rod clear between ,</l>
     <l n="11">Lest there should be no gold upon the green ,</l>
     <l n="12">And no light then for a child to dream upon ,</l>
     <l n="13">And day be of day 's brightness all forlorn .</l>
     <l n="14">I saw those timber piles first dark and tall ,</l>
     <l n="15">And then men clambered up , and stumbled down ,</l>
     <l n="16">Each with a heavy and long timber borne</l>
     <l n="17">Upon broad shoulders , leather-covered , bent .</l>
     <l n="18">Hour after hour , day after day they went ,</l>
     <l n="19">Until the piles were gone and a new sky</l>
     <l n="20">Stretched high and white above the garden wall .</l>
     <l n="21">And then fresh piles crept slowly up and up ,</l>
     <l n="22">The strong men staggering , more cruelly bowed ,</l>
     <l n="23">Till at last they lay idle on the top</l>
     <l n="24">Looking down from their height on things so small ,</l>
     <l n="25">While I looked wondering and fearful up</l>
     <l n="26">At the strong men at rest on the new-built cloud .</l>
     <l n="27">But there was other gold than the sun 's sparse gold —</l>
     <l n="28">Florence 's hair , its brightness lying still</l>
     <l n="29">Upon my mind as then upon the grass .</l>
     <l n="30">Now the grass covers it and I am old ,</l>
     <l n="31">Remembering but her hair and that long grass ,</l>
     <l n="32">And the great wood-stacks threatening to fall —</l>

    <head>THE FIRE</head>
     <l n="1">Near the house flowed , or paused , the black Canal ,</l>
     <l n="2">Edged by the timber piles so black and tall .</l>
     <l n="3">From the rotten fence I watched the horses pull</l>
     <l n="4">Along the footpath , slow and beautiful ,</l>
     <l n="5">Moving with strength and ease , in their great size</l>
     <l n="6">And untired movement wonderful to my eyes ;</l>
     <l n="7">Their dull brass clanking as each shaggy foot</l>
     <l n="8">Stamped the soft cinder track as fine as soot .</l>
     <l n="9">The driver lurched old and forbidding by ,</l>
     <l n="10">Not seeing the child that feared to meet his eye .</l>
     <l n="11">I watched the rope dip , tighten , and the water flash</l>
     <l n="12">In falling , and then heard the hiss and splash ;</l>
     <l n="13">I watched the barge drag slowly on and on ,</l>
     <l n="14">Not dreaming how lovely a ship could ride the water upon ,</l>
     <l n="15">Not dreaming how lovely flowing water was ,</l>
     <l n="16">Sung to by trees and fingered by long grass ,</l>
     <l n="17">Or running from the bosom of a hill</l>
     <l n="18">Down , where it flows so deep that it seems still .</l>
     <l n="19">But it was by that rotten fence one night</l>
     <l n="20">I saw the timber piles break into light ,</l>
     <l n="21">Suddenly leaping into a heavenly flame</l>
     <l n="22">That played with the wind and one with the wind became .</l>
     <l n="23">Pile to pile gave its fire , till they were like</l>
     <l n="24">Bright angels with flashing swords before they strike ,</l>
     <l n="25">Terrible and lovely . But men those angels fought ,</l>
     <l n="26">Small and humble and patient all night wrought ,</l>
     <l n="27">And all day wrought and night and day again ,</l>
     <l n="28">And night and day , pouring their hissing rain ,</l>
     <l n="29">Until the angels tired and one by one died .</l>
     <l n="30">Then their black spectres haunted the waterside ,</l>
     <l n="31">Charred ruins , broken-limbed , no more erect ,</l>
     <l n="32">Or heaped black dust , with cold white ashes flecked .</l>
     <l n="33">But I had seen the angel-quelling men ,</l>
     <l n="34">With blackened and bruised face , the horses thin ,</l>
     <l n="35">The glittering harness , the leaky , bubbling mains ,</l>
     <l n="36">The broad smoke , and the steam from the leaping rains :—</l>
     <l n="37">O I had seen what I should not forget ,</l>
     <l n="38">Men that defeated ruinous angels and shall still defeat .</l>

     <l n="1">It was like floating in a blessed dream to roam</l>
     <l n="2">Across green meadows , far from home ,</l>
     <l n="3">With only trees and quivering sky to hedge the sight ,</l>
     <l n="4">Dazzling the eyes with strange delight .</l>
     <l n="5">Such wide , wide fields I had never seen , and never dreamed</l>
     <l n="6">Could be ; and wonderful it seemed</l>
     <l n="7">To wander over green and under green and run</l>
     <l n="8">Unwatched even of the shining sun .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">One tree there was that held a wrinkled creaking bough</l>
     <l n="10">Far over the grass , hanging low ;</l>
     <l n="11">And a swing from it hanging drew us near and made</l>
     <l n="12">New brightness beneath that doming shade .</l>
     <l n="13">For there my sisters swung long hours delightedly ,</l>
     <l n="14">And there delighted clambered I ;</l>
     <l n="15">And all our voices shrilled as one when up we flung</l>
     <l n="16">And into the stinging sharp leaves swung .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="17">Then in a garden dense with bramble and sweet flowers</l>
     <l n="18">Where honeysuckle a new sweetness pours ,</l>
     <l n="19">We sat and ate and drank . Well I remember how</l>
     <l n="20">We were all shaded by one bough</l>
     <l n="21">Bending with red fruit over our uplifted eyes ,</l>

     <l n="23">And then we went back happy to the empty swing ,</l>

     <l n="26">Widening slowly everywhere .</l>
     <l n="27">It was like swinging in a solemn dream to roam</l>
     <l n="28">In a strange air , far from home —</l>
     <l n="29">Until I saw the shadows suddenly wake and move ,</l>
     <l n="30">And float , float down from above .</l>
     <l n="31">Then I ran quickly back , round the large gloomy trees ,</l>
     <l n="32">O with what shivering unease !</l>
     <l n="33">And stumbled where they waited , and was far too glad ,</l>

     <l n="29">O , not death I feared ,</l>
     <l n="30">But the anguish of the body ;</l>
     <l n="31">My dizzying passions heard ,</l>
     <l n="32">Saw my own bosom bloody .</l>
     <l n="33">I thought of years of woe ,</l>

     <l n="14">Rooted where the trees ’ roots entangled lie ,</l>
     <l n="15">In darkness ; or a flame burned solitary</l>
     <l n="16">In the middle of the highest of brown meadows ,</l>
     <l n="17">Burned solitary and unconsuming where</l>
     <l n="18">A red tree stooped to its black shadow and</l>
     <l n="19">The kestrel 's shadow hunted the kestrel up the hill .</l>

     <l n="2">The air grew bright and sweet , as though a flame</l>
     <l n="3">Had cleansed the world of winter . The low sky</l>
     <l n="4">As the wind lifted it rose trembling vast and high ,</l>
     <l n="5">And white clouds sallied by</l>
     <l n="6">As children in their pleasure go</l>
     <l n="7">Chasing the sun beneath the orchard 's shadow and snow .</l>
     <l n="8">Nothing , nothing was the same !</l>
     <l n="9">Not the dull brick , not the stained London stone ,</l>
     <l n="10">Not the delighted trees that lost their moan —</l>
     <l n="11">Their moan that daily vexed me with such pain</l>
     <l n="12">Until I hated to see trees again ;</l>
     <l n="13">Nor man nor woman was the same</l>
     <l n="14">Nor could be stones again ,</l>
     <l n="15">Such light and colour with the south-west came .</l>
     <l n="16">As I drank all that brightness up I saw</l>

     <l n="27">With cold gray light in cold gray eyes , and dark</l>
     <l n="28">Dark clouds caught round him , feet to rigid chin .</l>

     <l n="30">Godlike from hill to frozen hill-top stepp 'd ,</l>
     <l n="31">And swiftly upon that bony stature swept .</l>
     <l n="32">Then a long breath and then quick breaths I heard ,</l>
     <l n="33">In those black caves of stillness music stirred ,</l>
     <l n="34">Those icy heights were riven :</l>
     <l n="35">From crown to clearing hollow grass was green ;</l>
     <l n="36">And godlike from flushed hill to hill-top leapt</l>
     <l n="37">Time , youthful , quick , serene ,</l>

     <l n="39">To the sheeny skies .</l>
     <l n="40">A lark 's song climbed from earth and dropped from heaven ,</l>
     <l n="41">Far off the tide clung to the shore</l>

     <l n="52">Sweetness not sweetness was but indifference</l>
     <l n="53">Or wantonness disguised , to her grave sense ;</l>
     <l n="54">And if she could have seen the things she felt</l>
     <l n="55">She 'd looked for darkness , and lit shapes that knelt</l>
     <l n="56">Appealing , unregarded , at a high</l>
     <l n="57">Altar uprising from the pit to the sky ....</l>
     <l n="58">Had the trees consciousness , with flowers and clouds</l>
     <l n="59">And winds that hung like thin clouds in the woods ,</l>
     <l n="60">And stars and silence :— had they each a mind</l>
     <l n="61">Bending on hers , clear eyes on her eyes blind ?</l>
     <l n="62">In the green dense heights — elm , oak , ash , yew or beech</l>
     <l n="63">She scarce saw — was there not a brain in each ,</l>
     <l n="64">An undiscovered centre of quick nerves</l>
     <l n="65">By which ( like man ) the tree lives , masters , serves ,</l>
     <l n="66">Waxes and wanes ? Oppressed her mind would shrink</l>
     <l n="67">From thought , and into her trembling body sink .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="68">Something of this had childhood taught her when</l>
     <l n="69">Sickly she lay and peered again and again</l>
     <l n="70">At gray skies and white skies and void bright blue ,</l>
     <l n="71">And watched the sun the bare town-tree boughs through ,</l>
     <l n="72">And then through leafy boughs and once more bare .</l>
     <l n="73">Or in the west country 's heavy hill-drawn air</l>
     <l n="74">Had felt the green grass pushing within her veins ,</l>
     <l n="75">Tangling and strangling : and the warm spring rains</l>
     <l n="76">Tapping all night upon her childish head :</l>
     <l n="77">She shivered , lying lonely on her bed ,</l>
     <l n="78">With all that life all round and she so weak ,</l>
     <l n="79">Longing to speak — yet what was there to speak ?</l>
     <l n="80">And as she grew and health came and love came</l>
     <l n="81">And life was happier , happier , still the same</l>
     <l n="82">Inhuman spirit rose whenever she</l>
     <l n="83">Held in her thoughts more than her eyes could see .</l>
     <l n="84">Behind the happiest hours the dark cloud hung</l>
     <l n="85">Distant or nearing , and its dullness flung</l>
     <l n="86">On the south meadows of her thought , the fairest</l>
     <l n="87">Shrinking in shadow ; aspirations rarest</l>
     <l n="88">Falling , like shot birds in a reedy fen ,</l>
     <l n="89">Slain by the old Enemy of men .</l>
     <l n="90">Life ebbed while men strove for the means of life ;</l>
     <l n="91">The grudging earth turned labour into strife .</l>
     <l n="92">The moving hosts within the heavy clod</l>
     <l n="93">Seemed infinite in malice ; frost and flood ,</l>
     <l n="94">Season and inter-season , were conspired</l>
     <l n="95">In smiling or sour mockery ; and untired</l>
     <l n="96">And undelighted , man scratched and scratched on ,</l>
     <l n="97">And what he did , by Nature was undone .</l>
     <l n="98">She saw men twisted more than rocks or trees ,</l>
     <l n="99">Bruised , numbed , by age and labour and the disease</l>
     <l n="100">Of labour in the cold fields ; women worn</l>
     <l n="101">By many child-bearings , and their self-scorn</l>
     <l n="102">Because of time and their lost woman 's powers .</l>
     <l n="103">Bitter was Nature to women ; for those hours</l>
     <l n="104">Of the spirit 's and the body 's first delight</l>
     <l n="105">Passed soon , and the long day , evening , night</l>
     <l n="106">Of life uncherished ; bitterest when even</l>
     <l n="107">That brief hour was denied , of dancing heaven ,</l>
     <l n="108">Dewy love , and fulfilled desires .</l>
     <l n="109">But age</l>
     <l n="110">Of all ills made her pity and anger rage .</l>
     <l n="111">To see and smell the calm months bud and bloom ,</l>
     <l n="112">April 's first warmth , June 's hues and slow perfume ,</l>
     <l n="113">The sweetness drifting by in those long hours</l>
     <l n="114">While , out of her she nursed , the vital powers</l>
     <l n="115">Were pressed by pain and pressed by pain renewed ,</l>
     <l n="116">Till , closing the life-long vicissitude ,</l>
     <l n="117">Came starving death with full-heaped summer , and</l>
     <l n="118">Wrung the last pangs that spirit could withstand ...</l>
     <l n="119">Or to see age in its prison slowly freeze</l>
     <l n="120">With impotence more disastrous than disease ,</l>
     <l n="121">While trees flowered on , or all the winter through</l>
     <l n="122">Upheld brave arms and with spring flowered anew</l>
     <l n="123">Above those living graves and graves of the dead ;—</l>
     <l n="124">‘ Twas all such bitterness , but she nothing said .</l>
     <l n="125">She saw men as courageous boats that sailed</l>
     <l n="126">On all the seas , and some a far port hailed</l>
     <l n="127">Perhaps to sail again , or anchor there</l>
     <l n="128">Forever ; some would quietly disappear</l>
     <l n="129">In stormless waters , and some in storms be broken</l>
     <l n="130">And all be hidden and no clear meaning spoken ,</l>
     <l n="131">Nor any trace upon the waters linger .</l>
     <l n="132">Where the boat went the wind with hasty finger ,</l>
     <l n="133">Savage and sly as aught of land could be ,</l>
     <l n="134">Erased the little wrinkling of the sea .</l>
     <l n="135">O , in such enmity was man enisled ,</l>
     <l n="136">Such loneliness , by foolish shades beguiled ,</l>
     <l n="137">That it was bravery to see and live ,</l>
     <l n="138">But cowardice to see and to forgive ,</l>
     <l n="139">The wrong of evil , the wrong of death to life ,</l>
     <l n="140">The defeat of innocence , the waste of strife ,—</l>
     <l n="141">The heavy ills of time , injustice , pain —</l>
     <l n="142">In field and forest and flood rose huge and plain ,</l>
     <l n="143">Brushing her mind with darkness , till she thought</l>
     <l n="144">Not with her brain , but all her nerves were wrought</l>
     <l n="145">Into an apprehension burning strong ,</l>
     <l n="146">Unslackening , of mortality 's old wrong .</l>
     <l n="147">But if her eyes she raised to those clear lonely</l>
     <l n="148">Altitudes of stars and ether only ,</l>
     <l n="149">Her eyes fell and rebuked her as forbidden</l>
     <l n="150">With human mind to question what was hidden .</l>
     <l n="151">At summer dusk the broad moon rising high</l>
     <l n="152">Put gentleness in the vast strength of the sky ,</l>
     <l n="153">Easing its weight ; or the hot summer sun</l>
     <l n="154">Made noonday kind , and the hours lightly run .</l>
     <l n="155">But in those blazing midnights of the stars</l>
     <l n="156">Gathered and brightening for immortal wars</l>
     <l n="157">With spears and darts and arrows of sharp light ,</l>
     <l n="158">She read the indifference of the infinite ,</l>
     <l n="159">The high strife flashing through eternity</l>
     <l n="160">While on the earth stared mortals but as she .</l>

     <l n="164">Or easy gloom , or hues of faerie ,</l>
     <l n="165">She never saw , but into her own heart peered</l>

     <l n="181">So the old sorrowfulness in her thought</l>
     <l n="182">Renewed , and apprehensions all untaught ;</l>

     <l n="184">Still did she in the world 's dim morning live ,</l>

     <l n="25">And heard , faint from the woods all through the night ,</l>

    <head>SWEET ENGLAND</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">I heard a boy that climbed up Dover 's Hill</l>
     <l n="2">Singing Sweet England , sweeter for his song .</l>
     <l n="3">The notes crept muffled through the copse , but still</l>
     <l n="4">Sharply recalled the things forgotten long ,</l>
     <l n="5">The music that my own boy 's lips had known ,</l>
     <l n="6">Singing , and old airs on a wild flute blown ;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="7">And other hills , more grim and lonely far ,</l>
     <l n="8">And valleys empty of these orchard trees ;</l>
     <l n="9">A sheep-pond filled with the moon , a single star</l>
     <l n="10">I had watched by night searching the wreckful seas ;</l>
     <l n="11">And all the streets and streets that childhood knew</l>
     <l n="12">In years when London streets were all my view .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="13">And I remembered how that song I heard ,</l>
     <l n="14">Sweet England , sung by children on May-day ,</l>
     <l n="15">Nor any song was sweeter of a bird</l>
     <l n="16">Than that half-grievous air from children gay —</l>
     <l n="17">For then , as now , youth made the sadness bright ,</l>
     <l n="18">Till the words , Sweet , Sweet England , shone with light .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="19">Now , listening , I forgot how men yet fought</l>
     <l n="20">For this same England , till the song was done</l>
     <l n="21">And no sound lingered but the lark 's , that brought</l>
     <l n="22">New music down from fields of cloud and sun ,</l>
     <l n="23">Or the sad lapwing 's over fields of green</l>
     <l n="24">Crying beneath the copse , near but unseen .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="25">Then I remembered . All wide England spread</l>
     <l n="26">Before me , hill and wood and meadow and stream</l>
     <l n="27">And ancient roads and homes of men long dead ,</l>
     <l n="28">And all the beauty a familiar dream .</l>
     <l n="29">On the green hills a cloud of silver grey</l>
     <l n="30">Gave gentle light stranger than light of day .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="31">And clear between the hills , past the near crest</l>
     <l n="32">And many hills , the hungry cities crept ,</l>
     <l n="33">Noble and mean , oppressive and oppressed ,</l>
     <l n="34">Where dreams unrealized of England slept :</l>
     <l n="35">And they too England , packed in dusty street</l>
     <l n="36">With men that half forgot England was sweet .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="37">Now men were far , but like a living brain</l>
     <l n="38">Quick with their thought , the earth , hills , air and light</l>
     <l n="39">Were quivering as though a shining rain</l>
     <l n="40">Falling all round made even the light more bright ;</l>
     <l n="41">And trees and water and heath and hedge-flowers fair</l>
     <l n="42">With more than natural sweetness washed the air .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="43">From hill to hill a sparkling web it swung ,</l>
     <l n="44">A snare for happiness , lit with lovely dews .</l>
     <l n="45">The very smoke of cities now was hung</l>
     <l n="46">But like a grave girl 's dress of tranquil hues :</l>
     <l n="47">And how ( I thought ) can England , seen thus bright ,</l>
     <l n="48">Lifting her clear frank head , but love the light ?—</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="49">No , not her brain ! that bright web was the shadow</l>
     <l n="50">Of the high spirit in their spirit shining</l>
     <l n="51">Who on scarred foreign hill and trenchèd meadow</l>
     <l n="52">Kept the faith yet , unfearful , unrepining ;—</l>
     <l n="53">Her faith that with the dark world 's liberty</l>
     <l n="54">Mingles as earth 's great rivers with the sea .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="55">O with what gilding ray was the land agleam !</l>
     <l n="56">It was not sun and dew , bush , bough and leaf ,</l>
     <l n="57">But human spirits visible as in a dream</l>
     <l n="58">That turns from glad to aching , being too brief :</l>
     <l n="59">Courage and beauty shining in such brightness</l>
     <l n="60">That all the thoughtful woods were no more lightless .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="61">But most the hills a splendour had put on</l>
     <l n="62">Of golden honour , bright and high and calm</l>
     <l n="63">And like old heroes young men dream upon</l>
     <l n="64">When midnight stirs with magic sword and palm ;—</l>
     <l n="65">With the fled mist all meanness put away</l>
     <l n="66">And the air clear and keen as salt sea-spray ....</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="67">And yet no dream ; no dream ! I saw the whole ,</l>
     <l n="68">The reap 'd fields , idle kine and wandering sheep .</l>
     <l n="69">A weak wind through the near tall hedge-tree stole ,</l>
     <l n="70">And died where Dover 's Hill rose bare and steep ;</l>
     <l n="71">I saw yet what I saw an hour ago ,</l>
     <l n="72">But knew what save by dreams I did not know —</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="73">Sweet England !— wild proud heart of things unspoken</l>
     <l n="74">Spirit that men bear shyly and love purely ;</l>

     <l n="76">As spring from every winter rising surely :</l>
