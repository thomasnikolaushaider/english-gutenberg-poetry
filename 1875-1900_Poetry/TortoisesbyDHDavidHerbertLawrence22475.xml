       <l n="13">To lift the upper hawk-beak from the lower base</l>

       <l n="1">Voiceless little bird ,</l>

       <l n="4">Alone , with no sense of being alone ,</l>

     <p>Sex , which breaks us into voice , sets us calling across the deeps , calling , calling for the complement , Singing , and calling , and singing again , being answered , having found .</p>

       <l n="2">for what is lost ,</l>
       <l n="3">The same cry from the tortoise as from Christ ,</l>
       <l n="4">the Osiris-cry of abandonment ,</l>
       <l n="5">That which is whole , torn asunder ,</l>
       <l n="6">That which is in part , finding its whole again</l>
