     <p>The Hand</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">As you sit so , in the firelight , your hand is the color of</l>
       <l n="2">new bronze .</l>
       <l n="3">I cannot take my eyes from your hand ;</l>
       <l n="4">In it , as in a microcosm , the vast and shadowy Orient</l>
       <l n="5">is made visible .</l>
       <l n="6">Who shall read me your hand ?</l>
     </lg>
     <p>You are a large man , yet it is small and narrow , like the hand of a woman and the paw of a chimpanzee . It is supple and boneless as the hands wrought in pigment by a fashionable portrait painter . The tapering fingers bend backward . Between them burns a scented cigarette . You poise it with infinite daintiness , like a woman under the eyes of her lover . The long line of your curved nail is fastidiousness made flesh .</p>
     <p>Very skilful is your hand . With a tiny brush it can feather lines of ineffable suggestion , glints of hidden beauty . With a little tool it can carve strange dreams in ivory and milky jade .</p>
     <p>And cruel is your hand . With the same cold daintiness and skill it can devise exquisite tortures , eternities of incredible pain , that Torquemada never glimpsed . And voluptuous is your hand , nice in its sense of touch . Delicately it can caress a quivering skin , softly it can glide over golden thighs .... Bilitis had not such long nails .</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">Who can read me your hand ?</l>
       <l n="2">In the firelight the smoke curls up fantastically from</l>
       <l n="3">the cigarette between your fingers which are the</l>
       <l n="4">color of new bronze .</l>
       <l n="5">The room is full of strange shadows .</l>
       <l n="6">I am afraid of your hand ....</l>

     <p>The boats of your masters are black ; They are filthy with the slimy filth of ages ; like the canals on which they float they give forth an evil smell . On soiled perches you sit , swung out on either side over the scummy water — you who should be savage and untamed , who should ride on the clean breath of the sea and beat your pinions in the strong storms of the sea . Yet you are not held . Tamely you sit and willingly , ten wretches to a boat , lurching and half asleep .</p>
     <p>Around each throat is a ring of straw , a small ring , so that you may swallow only small things , such as your masters desire . Presently , when you reach the lake , you will dive . At the word of your masters the parted waters will close over you and in your ears will be the gurgling of yellow streams . Hungrily you will search in the darkened void , swiftly you will pounce on the silver shadow .... Then you will rise again , bearing in your beak the struggling prey , And your lousy lords , whose rings are upon your throats , will take from you the catch , giving in its place a puny wriggler which can pass the gates of straw . Such is your servitude .</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">Yet willingly you sit , lurching and half asleep .</l>
       <l n="2">The boatmen shout one to another in nasal discords .</l>
       <l n="3">Lazily you preen your great wings , eagle wings ,</l>
       <l n="4">built for the sky ;</l>
       <l n="5">And you yawn ....</l>
     </lg>
     <p>Faugh ! The sight of you sickens me , divers in inland filth ! You grow lousy like your lords , For you have forgotten the sea .</p>

       <l n="1">The Story Teller</l>
     </lg>
     <p>In a corner of the market-place he sits , his face the target for many eyes . The sombre crowd about him is motionless . Behind their faces no lamp burns ; only their eyes glow faintly with a reflected light . For their eyes are on his face . It alone is alive , is vibrant , moving bronze under a sun of bronze . The taut skin , like polished metal , shines along his cheek and jaw . His eyes cut upward from a slender nose , and his quick mouth moves sharply out and in .</p>
     <p>Artful are the gestures of his mouth , elaborate and full of guile . When he draws back the bow of his lips his face is like a mask of lacquer , set with teeth of pearl , fantastic , terrible .... What strange tale lives in the gestures of his mouth ? Does a fox-maiden , bewitching , tiny-footed , lure a scholar to his doom ? Is an unfilial son tortured of devils ? Or does a decadent queen sport with her eunuchs ?</p>

     <p>At the bottom of the well are coppers and coins with square holes in them , thrown thither by devout hands . They gleam enticingly through the shallow water . The people crowd about the well , leaning brown covetous faces above the coping as my copper falls slantwise to rest .</p>

     </lg>
     <p>In the cold darkness of eternity he sits , this god who has grown old . His rounded eyes are open on the whir of time , but man who made him has forgotten him .</p>
     <p>Blue is his graven face , and silver-blue his hands . His eyebrows and his silken beard are scarlet as the hope that built him . The yellow dragon on his rotting robes still rears itself majestically , but thread by thread time eats its scales away , And man who made him has forgotten him .</p>

       <l n="4">fingers , and nest them in his yellow nails .</l>
       <l n="5">And darkness broods upon him .</l>
       <l n="6">The veil that hid the awful face of godhead from the</l>
       <l n="7">too impetuous gaze of worshippers serves in decay</l>

       <l n="2">The Bridge of the Eight Scholars spans the canal narrowly .</l>
       <l n="3">On the gray stone of its arch are carvings in low relief ,</l>

     <p>In our house-boat we pass under it . The boatman with the rat-like face twists the long broken-backed oar , churning the yellow water , and we creep forward steadily . On the bridge the village is assembled . Foreign devils are a rarity . The gold-brown faces are not unfriendly , merely curious . They peer in rows over the rail with grunts of nasal interest . Tentatively , experimentally , as we pass they spit down upon us . Not that they wish us ill , but it can be done , and the temptation is too great .</p>

     </lg>
     <p>The master of the shop is a pious man , in good odor with the priests . He is old and honorable and his white moustache droops below his chin . Mencius , I think , looked so .</p>
     <p>The shop behind him is a mimic world , a world of pieties and shams — the valley of remembrance — the dwelling place of the unquiet dead . Here on his shelves are ranged the splendor and the panoply of life , silk in smooth gleaming rolls , silver in ingots , carving and embroidery and jade , a scarlet bearer-chair , a pipe for opium .... Whatever life has need of , it is here , And it is for the dead .</p>
     <p>Whatever life has need of , it is here . Yet it is here in sham , in effigy , in tortured compromise . The dead have need of silk . Yet silk is dear , and there are living backs to clothe . The rolls are paper .... Do not look too close .</p>

       <l n="5">Yet they are made with skill and loving care !</l>
       <l n="6">And if the priest knows — surely he must know !—</l>
       <l n="7">when they are burned they 'll serve the dead as</l>
       <l n="8">well as verities .</l>
       <l n="9">So living mouths can feed .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="10">The master of the shop is a pious man . He has attained</l>
       <l n="11">much honor and his white moustache droops</l>
       <l n="12">below his chin .</l>
       <l n="13">“ Such an one ” he says “ I burned for my own father .</l>
       <l n="14">And such an one my son will burn for me .</l>
       <l n="15">For I am old , and half my life already dwells among</l>
       <l n="16">the dead . ”</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>And , as he speaks , behind him in the shop I feel the presence of a hovering host , the myriads of the immortal dead , the rulers of the spirit in this land ....</p>
     <p>For in this kingdom of the dead they who are living cling with fevered hands to the torn fringes of the mighty past . And if they fail a little , compromise ....</p>

       <l n="1">The Feast</l>
     </lg>
     <p>So this is the wedding feast ! The room is not large , but it is heavily crowded , filled with small tables , filled with many human bodies . About the walls are paintings and banners in sharp colors ; above our heads hang innumerable gaudy lanterns of wood and paper . We sit in furs , shivering with the cold . The food passes endlessly , droll combinations in brown gravies — roses , sugar , and lard — duck and bamboo — lotus , chestnuts , and fish-eggs — an “ eight-precious pudding . ” They tempt curiosity ; my chop-sticks are busy . The warm rice-wine trickles sparingly .</p>
     <p>The groom is invisible somewhere , but the bride martyrs among us . She is clad in scarlet satin , heavily embroidered with gold . On her head is an edifice of scarlet and pearls . For weeks , I know , she has wept in protest . The feast-mother leads her in to us with sacrificial rites . Her eyes are closed , hidden behind her curtain of strung beads ; for three days she will not open them . She has never seen the bridegroom .</p>
     <p>At the feast she sits like her own effigy . She neither eats nor speaks . Opposite her , across the narrow table , is a wall of curious faces , lookers-on — children and half-grown boys , beggars and what-not — the gleanings of the streets . They are quiet but they watch hungrily . To-night , when the bridegroom draws the scarlet curtains of the bed , they will still be watching hungrily ....</p>
     <p>Strange , formless memories out of books struggle upward in my consciousness . This is the marriage at Cana .... I am feasting with the Caliph at Bagdad .... I am the wedding guest who beat his breast .... My heart is troubled . What shall be said of blood-brotherhood between man and man ?</p>

Beside the body are stretched two naked stumps of flesh , on one the remnant of a foot . The wounds are not new wounds , but they are open and they fester . There are flies on them . The Thing is whining , shrilly , hideously .</p>

       <l n="1">The City Wall</l>
     </lg>
     <p>About the city where I dwell , guarding it close , runs an embattled wall . It was not new I think when Arthur was a king , and plumèd knights before a British wall made brave clangor of trumpets , that Launcelot came forth . It was not new I think , and now not it but chivalry is old .</p>
     <p>Without , the wall is brick , with slots for firing , and it drops straightway into the evil moat , where offal floats and nameless things are thrown . Within , the wall is earth ; it slants more gently down , covered with grass and stubbly with cut weeds . Below it in straw lairs the beggars herd , patiently whining , stretching out their sores . And on the top a path runs .</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">As I walk , lifted above the squalor and the dirt , the</l>
       <l n="2">timeless miracle of sunset mantles in the west ,</l>
       <l n="3">The blue dusk gathers close</l>
       <l n="4">And beauty moves immortal through the land .</l>
       <l n="5">And I walk quickly , praying in my heart that beauty</l>
       <l n="6">will defend me , will heal up the too great wounds</l>
       <l n="7">of China .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>I will not look — to-night I will not look — where at my feet the little coffins are , The boxes where the beggar children lie , unburied and unwatched . I will not look again , for once I saw how one was broken , torn by the sharp teeth of dogs . A little tattered dress was there , and some crunched bones .... I need not look . What can it help to look ?</p>

     <p>Strangely the sight of you moves me . I have no standard by which to appraise you ; the outer shell of you is all I know . Yet irresistibly you draw me .</p>
     <p>Your small plump body is closely clad in blue brocaded satin . The fit is scrupulous , yet no woman 's figure is revealed . You are decorously shapeless . Your satin trousers even are lined with fur . Your hair is stiff and lustrous as polished ebony , bound at the neck in an adamantine knot , in which dull pearls are encrusted .</p>

     </lg>
     <p>It stands before my neighbor 's door , between him and the vegetable garden and the open toilet pots and the dirty canal . Not that he wishes to hide these things . On the contrary , he misses the view . But China , you must understand , is full of evil spirits , demons of the earth and air , foxes and shui-mang devils , and only the priest knows what beside . A man may at any moment be bewitched , so that his silk-worms die and his children go blind and he gets the devil-sickness . So living is difficult . But Heaven has providentially decreed that these evil spirits can travel only in a straight line . Around a corner their power evaporates . So my neighbor has built a wall that runs before his door . Windows of course he has none . He cannot see his vegetable garden , and his toilet pots , and the dirty canal . But he is quite safe !</p>

     <p>Space , and the twelve clean winds of heaven , And this sharp exultation , like a cry , after the slow six thousand steps of climbing ! This is Tai Shan , the beautiful , the most holy .</p>
     <p>Below my feet the foot-hills nestle , brown with flecks of green ; and lower down the flat brown plain , the floor of earth , stretches away to blue infinity . Beside me in this airy space the temple roofs cut their slow curves against the sky , And one black bird circles above the void .</p>
     <p>Space , and the twelve clean winds are here ; And with them broods eternity — a swift , white peace , a presence manifest . The rhythm ceases here . Time has no place . This is the end that has no end .</p>
     <p>Here when Confucius came , a half a thousand years before the Nazarene , he stepped , with me , thus into timelessness . The stone beside us waxes old , the carven stone that says : On this spot once Confucius stood and felt the smallness of the world below .</p>

     <p>The furnaces , the great steel furnaces , tremble and glow ; gigantic machinery clanks , and in living iridescent streams the white-hot slag pours out . This is to-morrow set in yesterday , the west imbedded in the east , a graft but not a growth .</p>

     <p>In all the city where I dwell two spaces only are wide and clean . One is the compound about the great church of the mission within the wall ; the other is the courtyard of the great factory beyond the wall . In these two , one can breathe .</p>
     <p>And two sounds there are , above the multitudinous crying of the city , two sounds that recur as time recurs — the great bell of the mission and the whistle of the factory . Every hour of the day the mission bell strikes , clear , deep-toned — telling perhaps of peace . And in the morning and in the evening the factory whistle blows , shrill , provocative — telling surely of toil . Now , when the mulberry trees are bare and the wintry wind lifts the rags of the beggars , the day shift at the factory is ten hours , and the night shift is fourteen . They are divided one from the other by the whistle , shrill , provocative . The mission and the factory are the West . What they are I know .</p>
     <p>And between them lies the Orient — struggling and suffering , spawning and dying — but what it is I shall never know .</p>
     <p>Yet there are two clean spaces in the city where I dwell , the compound of the church within the wall , and the courtyard of the factory beyond the wall . It is something that in these two one can breathe .</p>

     <p>The runner interests me . Between the shafts he trots easily and familiarly , lifting his knees prettily and holding his shoulders steady . His hips are lean and narrow as a filly 's ; his calves might have posed for Praxiteles . He is a modern , I perceive , for he wears no queue . Above a rounded neck rises a shock of hair the shade of dusty coal . Each hair is stiff and erect as a brush bristle . There are lice in them no doubt — but then perhaps we of the West are too squeamish in details of this minor sort . What interests me chiefly is the back of his ears . Not that they are extraordinary as ears ; it is their very normality that touches me . I find them smaller than those of a horse , but undoubtedly near of kin .</p>

     </lg>
     <p>He is not an old man , but he is lonely . He who was born in the clash of a western city dwells here , in this silent courtyard , alone . Seven servants he has , seven men-servants . They move about quietly and their slippered feet make no sound . Behind their almond eyes move green , sidelong shadows , and their limber hands are never still . In his house the riches of the Orient are gathered . Ivory he has , carved in a thousand quaint , enticing shapes — pleasant to the hand , smooth with the caressing of many fingers . And jade is there , dark green and milky white , with amber from Korea and strange gems — beryl , chrysoprase , jasper , sardonyx .... His lacquered shelves hold priceless pottery — peachblow and cinnabar and silver grey — pottery glazed like the new moon , fired how long ago for a moon-pale princess of the East , whose very name is dust !</p>
     <p>In his vaults are incredible textures and colors that vibrate like struck jade .</p>
     <p>Stiff with gold brocade they are , or soft as the coat of a fawn — these sacred robes of a long dead priest , silks of a gold-skinned courtesan , embroideries of a lost throne . When he unfolds them the shimmering heaps are like living opals , burning and moving darkly with the warm breath of beauty .</p>

       <l n="1">Sunday in the British Empire : Hong Kong</l>
     </lg>
     <p>In the aisle of the cathedral it lies , an army rifle of the latest type . It is laid on the black and white mosaic , between the carved oaken pews and the strip of brown carpet in the aisle . A crimson light from the stained-glass window yonder glints on the blue steel of its barrel , and the khaki of its shoulder-strap blends with the brown of the carpet .</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">The stiff backs of its owner and a hundred like him</l>
       <l n="2">are very still .</l>
       <l n="3">The vested choir chants prettily .</l>
       <l n="4">Then the bishop speaks :</l>
       <l n="5">“ O God , who art the author of peace and lover of</l>
       <l n="6">concord ,... defend us thy humble servants</l>
       <l n="7">in all assaults of our enemies . ”</l>
       <l n="8">“ Amen ! ” say the owners of the khaki backs .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>The light has shifted a little . On the blue steel barrel of the rifle the glint is turquoise now . That will be from the robe of the shepherd in the window yonder , He of the quiet eyes ....</p>

     </lg>
     <p>Up and down , up and down , paces the sentry . He is dressed in a uniform of khaki and his socks are green . Over his shoulder is slung a rifle , and from his belt hang a pistol and cartridge pouch . He is , I think , Malay and Chinese mixed .</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">Behind him the rocky islands , hazed in blue , the yellow</l>
       <l n="2">sun-drenched water , the tropic shore , pass as a</l>
       <l n="3">background in a dream .</l>
       <l n="4">He only is sweltering reality .</l>
       <l n="5">Yet he is here to guard against a nightmare , an</l>
       <l n="6">anachronism , something that I cannot grasp .</l>
       <l n="7">He is guarding me from pirates .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>Piracy ! The very name is fantastic in my ears , colored like a toucan in the zoo . And yet the ordinance is clear : “ Four armed guards , strong metal grills behind the bridge , the engine-room enclosed — in case of piracy . ”</p>
     <p>The socks of the sentry are green . Up and down , up and down he paces , between the bridge and the first of the life-boats . In my deck chair I grow restless .</p>
     <p>Am I then so far removed from life , so wrapped in cotton wool , so deep-sunk in the soft lap of civilization , that I cannot feel the cold splash of truth ? It is a disquieting thought — for certainly piracy seems as fantastic as ever .</p>

     <p>The seat of my chair is of wicker . It is not unlike an invalid chair , and I , in it , am swaddled like an invalid , wrapped in layer on layer of coddling wool . But there are no wheels to my chair . I ride on the steady feet of four queued coolies . The tramp of their lifted shoes is the rhythm of being , throbbing in me as my own heart throbs .</p>
     <p>Save for their feet the bearers are silent . They move softly through the live darkness . But now and again I am shifted skilfully from one shoulder to the other .</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">The breath of the coolies is short .</l>

       <l n="1">In the Mixed Court : Shanghai</l>
     </lg>
     <p>Two men sit in judgment on their fellows . Side by side they sit , raised on the pedestal of the law , at grips with squalor and ignorance . They are civilization — and they are very grave .</p>
     <p>One of them is of my own people , a small man , definite , hard-featured , an accurate weapon of small calibre . Of the other I cannot judge . He is heavily built , and when he is still the dignity of the Orient is about him like his robe . His head is large and beautifully domed , his hands tapering and aristocratic . When he speaks it is of subtleties . But when he speaks his dignity drops from him . His eyes shift quickly from one end of their little slit to the other , his mouth , his full brown mouth , moves over-fast , his hands flicker back and forth .</p>
     <p>The courtroom is crowded with ominous yellow poverty . The cases are of many sorts . A woman , she of the little tortured feet and sullen face , has kidnapped a small boy to sell . A man was caught smuggling opium . A tea-merchant , in dark green silk , complains that he was decoyed and held prisoner in a lodging-house for ransom . A gambling den has been raided and the ivory dominoes are shown in court . The prisoners are stoically sullen . The odor of them fills the room .</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">Above them sit the two men , raised on the pedestal</l>
       <l n="2">of the law , judging their fellows .</l>
       <l n="3">I turn to the man beside me , waiting his case .</l>
       <l n="4">“ Tell me ” I ask “ of these men , which is the better</l>
       <l n="5">judge ? ”</l>
       <l n="6">He answers carefully .</l>
       <l n="7">“ The Chinaman is cleverer by half . He sees where</l>
       <l n="8">the other is blind . But Chinese magistrates are</l>
       <l n="9">bought , and this one sells himself too cheap . ”</l>
       <l n="10">“ And the other ? ” I ask again .</l>
       <l n="11">“ A good man , and quite honest . You see he does n't</l>
       <l n="12">care . ”</l>
     </lg>
     <p>The judges put their heads together . They are civilization and they are very grave . What , I wonder , is civilization ?</p>
