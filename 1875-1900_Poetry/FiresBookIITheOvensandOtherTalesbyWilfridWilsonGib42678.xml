    <head>FIRES</head>
    <head>THE CRANE</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">The biggest crane on earth , it lifts</l>
     <l n="2">Two hundred ton more easily</l>
     <l n="3">Than I can lift my heavy head :</l>
     <l n="4">And when it swings , the whole world shifts ,</l>
     <l n="5">Or so , at least , it seems to me ,</l>
     <l n="6">As , day and night , adream I lie</l>
     <l n="7">Upon my crippled back in bed ,</l>
     <l n="8">And watch it up against the sky .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">My mother , hunching in her chair ,</l>
     <l n="10">Day-long , and stitching trousers there —</l>
     <l n="11">At three-and-three the dozen pair ...</l>
     <l n="12">She 'd sit all night , and stitch for me ,</l>
     <l n="13">Her son , if I could only wear ...</l>
     <l n="14">She never lifts her eyes to see</l>
     <l n="15">The big crane swinging through the air .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="16">But , though she has no time to talk ,</l>
     <l n="17">She always cleans the window-pane ,</l>
     <l n="18">That I may see it , clear and plain :</l>
     <l n="19">And , as I watch it move , I walk</l>
     <l n="20">Who never walked in all my days ...</l>
     <l n="21">And , often , as I dream agaze ,</l>
     <l n="22">I 'm up and out : and it is I</l>
     <l n="23">Who swing the crane across the sky .</l>
     <l n="24">Right up above the wharf I stand ,</l>
     <l n="25">And touch a lever with my hand ,</l>
     <l n="26">To lift a bunch of girders high ,</l>
     <l n="27">A truck of coal , a field of grain</l>
     <l n="28">In sacks , a bundle of big trees ,</l>
     <l n="29">Or beasts , too frightened in my grip</l>
     <l n="30">To wonder at their skiey trip :</l>
     <l n="31">And then I let the long arm dip</l>
     <l n="32">Without a hitch , without a slip ,</l>
     <l n="33">To set them safely in the ship</l>
     <l n="34">That waits to take them overseas .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="35">My mother little dreams it 's I ,</l>
     <l n="36">Up there , as tiny as a fly ,</l>
     <l n="37">Who stand above the biggest crane ,</l>
     <l n="38">And swing the ship-loads through the sky ;</l>
     <l n="39">While she sits , hunching in her chair ,</l>
     <l n="40">Day-long , and stitching trousers there —</l>
     <l n="41">At three-and-three the dozen pair .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="42">And sometimes when it turns me dizzy ,</l>
     <l n="43">I lie and watch her , ever busy ;</l>
     <l n="44">And wonder at a lot of things</l>
     <l n="45">I never speak to her about :</l>
     <l n="46">I wonder why she never sings</l>
     <l n="47">Like other people on the stair ...</l>
     <l n="48">And why , whenever she goes out</l>
     <l n="49">Upon a windy day , the air</l>
     <l n="50">Makes her sad eyes so strangely bright ...</l>
     <l n="51">And if the colour of her hair</l>
     <l n="52">Was brown like mine , or always white ...</l>
     <l n="53">And why , when through the noise of feet</l>
     <l n="54">Of people passing in the street ,</l>
     <l n="55">She hears a dog yelp or sheep bleat ,</l>
     <l n="56">She always starts up in her chair ,</l>
     <l n="57">And looks before her with strange stare ,</l>
     <l n="58">Yet , seeing nothing anywhere :</l>
     <l n="59">Though , right before her , through the sky ,</l>
     <l n="60">The biggest crane goes swinging by .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="61">But , it 's a lucky day and rare</l>
     <l n="62">When she 's the time to talk with me ...</l>
     <l n="63">Though , only yesterday , when night</l>
     <l n="64">Shut out , at last , the crane from sight ...</l>
     <l n="65">She , in her bed , and thinking I</l>
     <l n="66">Was sleeping — though I watch the sky ,</l>
     <l n="67">At times , till it is morning-light ,</l>
     <l n="68">And ships are waiting to unload —</l>
     <l n="69">I heard her murmur drowsily :</l>
     <l n="70">“ The pit-pat-pattering of feet ,</l>
     <l n="71">All night , along the moonlit road ...</l>
     <l n="72">A yelp , a whistle , and a bleat ...</l>
     <l n="73">The bracken 's deep and soft and dry ...</l>
     <l n="74">And safe and snug , and no one near ...</l>
     <l n="75">The little burn sings low and sweet ,</l>
     <l n="76">The little burn sings shrill and clear ...</l>
     <l n="77">And loud all night the cock-grouse talks ...</l>
     <l n="78">There 's naught in heaven or earth to fear ...</l>
     <l n="79">The pit-pat-pattering of feet ...</l>
     <l n="80">A yelp , a whistle , and a bleat ... ”</l>
     <l n="81">And then , she started up in bed :</l>
     <l n="82">I felt her staring , as she said :</l>
     <l n="83">“ I wonder if he ever hears</l>
     <l n="84">The pit-pat-pattering of sheep ,</l>
     <l n="85">Or smells the broken bracken stalks ...</l>
     <l n="86">While she is lying sound-asleep</l>
     <l n="87">Beside him ... after all these years —</l>
     <l n="88">Just nineteen years , this very night —</l>
     <l n="89">Remembering ? ... and now , his son ,</l>
     <l n="90">A man ... and never stood upright ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="91">And then , I heard a sound of tears ;</l>
     <l n="92">But dared not speak , or let her know</l>
     <l n="93">I 'd caught a single whisper , though</l>
     <l n="94">I wondered long what she had done</l>
     <l n="95">That she should fear the pattering feet :</l>
     <l n="96">And when those queer words in the night</l>
     <l n="97">Had fretted me half-dead with fright ,</l>
     <l n="98">And set my throbbing head abeat ...</l>
     <l n="99">Out of the darkness , suddenly ,</l>
     <l n="100">The crane 's long arm swung over me ,</l>
     <l n="101">Among the stars , high overhead ...</l>
     <l n="102">And then it dipped , and clutched my bed</l>
     <l n="103">And I had not a breath to cry ,</l>
     <l n="104">Before it swung me through the sky ,</l>
     <l n="105">Above the sleeping city high ,</l>
     <l n="106">Where blinding stars went blazing by ...</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="107">My mother , hunching in her chair ,</l>
     <l n="108">Day-long , and stitching trousers there ,</l>
     <l n="109">At three-and-three the dozen pair ,</l>
     <l n="110">With quiet eyes and smooth white hair ...</l>
     <l n="111">You 'd little think a yelp or bleat</l>
     <l n="112">Could start her ; or that she was weeping</l>
     <l n="113">So sorely , when she thought me sleeping .</l>
     <l n="114">She never tells me why she fears</l>
     <l n="115">The pit-pat-pattering of feet</l>
     <l n="116">All night along the moonlit road ...</l>
     <l n="117">Or what 's the wrong that she has done ...</l>
     <l n="118">I wonder if ‘ twould bring her tears ,</l>
     <l n="119">If she could know that I , her son —</l>
     <l n="120">A man , who never stood upright ,</l>
     <l n="121">But all the livelong day must lie ,</l>
     <l n="122">And watch , beyond the window-pane</l>
     <l n="123">The swaying of the biggest crane —</l>
     <l n="124">That I , within its clutch , last night ,</l>
     <l n="125">Went whirling through the starry sky .</l>
    </lg>
    <p>THE LIGHTHOUSE</p>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="126">Just as my watch was done , the fog had lifted ;</l>
     <l n="127">And we could see the flashing of our light ;</l>
     <l n="128">And see , once more , the reef beyond the Head ,</l>
     <l n="129">O'er which , six days and nights , the mist had drifted —</l>
     <l n="130">Six days and nights in thick white mist had drifted ,</l>
     <l n="131">Until it seemed all time to mist had drifted ,</l>
     <l n="132">And day and night were but one blind white night .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="133">But on the seventh midnight the wind shifted :</l>
     <l n="134">And I was glad to tumble into bed ,</l>
     <l n="135">Thankful to hear no more the blaring horn ,</l>
     <l n="136">That ceaselessly had sounded , night and morn ,</l>
     <l n="137">With moaning echoes through the mist , to warn</l>
     <l n="138">The blind , bewildered ships at sea :</l>
     <l n="139">Yet , though as tired as any dog ,</l>
     <l n="140">I lay awhile , and seemed to feel</l>
     <l n="141">Fog lying on my eyes still heavily ;</l>
     <l n="142">And still , the horn unceasingly</l>
     <l n="143">Sang through my head , till gradually</l>
     <l n="144">Through night 's strange stillness , over me</l>
     <l n="145">Sweet sleep began to steal ,</l>
     <l n="146">Sleep , blind and thick and fleecy as the fog .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="147">For all I knew , I might have slept</l>
     <l n="148">A moment , or eternity ;</l>
     <l n="149">When , startled by a crash ,</l>
     <l n="150">I waked to find I 'd leapt</l>
     <l n="151">Upright on the floor :</l>
     <l n="152">And stood there , listening to the smash</l>
     <l n="153">Of falling glass ... and then a thud</l>
     <l n="154">Of something heavy tumbling</l>
     <l n="155">Into the next room ...</l>
     <l n="156">A pad of naked feet ...</l>
     <l n="157">A moan ... a sound of stumbling ...</l>
     <l n="158">A heavier thud ... and then no more .</l>
     <l n="159">And I stood shivering in the gloom ,</l>
     <l n="160">With creeping flesh , and tingling blood ,</l>
     <l n="161">Until I gave myself a shake</l>
     <l n="162">To bring my wits more wide awake ;</l>
     <l n="163">And lit a lantern , and flung wide the door .</l>
     <l n="164">Half-dazed , and dazzled by the light ,</l>
     <l n="165">At first it seemed I 'd only find</l>
     <l n="166">A broken pane , a flapping blind :</l>
     <l n="167">But when I raised the lantern o'er my head ,</l>
     <l n="168">I saw a naked boy upon the bed ,</l>
     <l n="169">Who crouched and shuddered on the folded sheet ;</l>
     <l n="170">And , on his face , before my feet ,</l>
     <l n="171">A naked man , who lay as if quite dead ,</l>
     <l n="172">Though on his broken knuckles blood was red :</l>
     <l n="173">And all my wits awakened at the sight .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="174">I set the lantern down ; and took the child ,</l>
     <l n="175">Who looked at me , with piteous eyes and wild ;</l>
     <l n="176">And chafed his chill , wet body , till it glowed ;</l>
     <l n="177">And forcing spirit ‘ twixt his chattering teeth ,</l>
     <l n="178">I tucked him snugly in beneath</l>
     <l n="179">The blankets , and soon left him warmly stowed :</l>
     <l n="180">And stooped to tend the man , who lay</l>
     <l n="181">Still senseless on the floor .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="182">I turned him off his face ;</l>
     <l n="183">And laid him on the other bed ;</l>
     <l n="184">And washed and staunched his wound .</l>
     <l n="185">And yet for all that I could do ,</l>
     <l n="186">I could not bring him to ,</l>
     <l n="187">Or see a trace</l>
     <l n="188">Of life returning to that heavy head .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="189">It seemed he 'd swooned ,</l>
     <l n="190">When through the window he 'd made way ,</l>
     <l n="191">Just having strength to lay</l>
     <l n="192">The boy in safety . Still as death ,</l>
     <l n="193">He lay , without a breath :</l>
     <l n="194">And seeing I could do no more</l>
     <l n="195">To help him in the fight for life ;</l>
     <l n="196">I turned again to tend the lad ;</l>
     <l n="197">And , as I looked on him , was glad</l>
     <l n="198">To find him sleeping quietly .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="199">So , fetching fuel , I lit a fire :</l>
     <l n="200">And quickly had as big a blaze</l>
     <l n="201">As any housewife could desire :</l>
     <l n="202">Then , ‘ twixt the beds , I set a chair ,</l>
     <l n="203">That I might watch until they stirred :</l>
     <l n="204">And as I saw them lying there —</l>
     <l n="205">The sleeping boy , and him who lay</l>
     <l n="206">In that strange stiller sleep , ‘ twas plain</l>
     <l n="207">That they were son and father , now</l>
     <l n="208">I 'd time to look , and wonder how ,</l>
     <l n="209">In such a desperate plight ,</l>
     <l n="210">Without a stitch or rag ,</l>
     <l n="211">They 'd taken refuge from the night .</l>
     <l n="212">And , as I wondered drowsily ,</l>
     <l n="213">It seemed yet queerer and more queer ;</l>
     <l n="214">For round the Head the rocks are sheer ,</l>
     <l n="215">With scarce a foothold for a bird ;</l>
     <l n="216">And it seemed quite beyond belief</l>
     <l n="217">That any wrecked upon the reef ,</l>
     <l n="218">Could swim ashore , and scale the crag ,</l>
     <l n="219">By daylight , let alone by night</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="220">But , they who live beside the sea</l>
     <l n="221">Know naught 's too wonderful to be :</l>
     <l n="222">And , as I sat , and heard</l>
     <l n="223">The quiet breathing of the child ,</l>
     <l n="224">Great weariness came over me ;</l>
     <l n="225">And , in a kind of daze ,</l>
     <l n="226">I watched the blaze ,</l>
     <l n="227">With nodding head :</l>
     <l n="228">And must have slept , for , presently ,</l>
     <l n="229">I found the man was sitting up in bed :</l>
     <l n="230">And talking to himself , with wide , unseeing eyes .</l>
     <l n="231">At first , I hardly made out what he said :</l>
     <l n="232">But soon his voice , so hoarse and wild ,</l>
     <l n="233">Grew calm : and , straining , I could hear</l>
     <l n="234">The broken words , that came with many sighs .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="235">“ Yes , lad : she 's going : but , there 's naught to fear :</l>
     <l n="236">For I can swim : and tow you in the belt .</l>
     <l n="237">Come , let 's join hands together ; and leap clear ...</l>
     <l n="238">Aye , son : it 's dark and cold ... but you have felt</l>
     <l n="239">The cold and dark before ...</l>
     <l n="240">And you should scorn ...</l>
     <l n="241">And we must be near shore ...</l>
     <l n="242">For , hark the horn !</l>
     <l n="243">Think of your mother , and your home , and leap ...</l>
     <l n="244">She thinks of us , lad , waking or asleep ...</l>
     <l n="245">You would not leave her lonely ?</l>
     <l n="246">Nay ! ... then ... go ! ...</l>
     <l n="247">Well done , lad ! ... Nay ! I 'm here ...</l>
     <l n="248">Aye , son , it 's cold : but you 're too big to fear .</l>
     <l n="249">Now then , you 're snug : I 've got you safe in tow :</l>
     <l n="250">The worst is over : and we 've only</l>
     <l n="251">To make for land ... we 've naught ... to do ... but steer ...</l>
     <l n="252">But steer ... but steer ... ”</l>

     <l n="549">To John the thought came that it might be well</l>
     <l n="550">To hurry home ; so , striding on before ,</l>
     <l n="551">He set a steady face across the moor ;</l>
     <l n="552">And called to Janey she must come more quickly .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="38">
     <l n="553">The wind soon dropped : and fine and dry the snow</l>
     <l n="554">Came whispering down about them , as they trudged</l>
     <l n="555">And , when they 'd travelled for a mile or so ,</l>
     <l n="556">They found it ankle-deep : for here the storm</l>
     <l n="557">Had started long before it reached the school :</l>
     <l n="558">And , as he felt the dry flakes tingling warm</l>
     <l n="559">Upon his cheek , and set him all aglow ,</l>
     <l n="560">John in his manly pride , a little grudged</l>
     <l n="561">That now and then he had to wait awhile</l>
     <l n="562">For Janey , lagging like a little fool :</l>
     <l n="563">But , when they 'd covered near another mile</l>
     <l n="564">Through that bewildering white without a sound ,</l>
     <l n="565">Save rustling , rustling , rustling all around ;</l>
     <l n="566">And all his well-known world , so queer and dim ,</l>
     <l n="567">He waited until she caught up to him ;</l>
     <l n="568">And felt quite glad that he was not alone .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="39">
     <l n="569">And when they reached the low , half-buried stone</l>
     <l n="570">That marked where some old shepherd had been found ,</l>
     <l n="571">Lost in the snow in seeking his lost sheep ,</l>
     <l n="572">One wild March night , full forty years ago ,</l>
     <l n="573">He wished , and wished , that they were safe and sound</l>
     <l n="574">In their own house : and as the snow got deeper ,</l>
     <l n="575">And every little bank seemed strangely steeper ,</l>
     <l n="576">He thought , and thought of that lost sleeper ;</l>
     <l n="577">And saw him lying in the snow ,</l>
     <l n="578">Till every fleecy clump of heath</l>
     <l n="579">Seemed to shroud a man beneath ;</l>
     <l n="580">And now his blood went hot and cold</l>
     <l n="581">Through very fear of that dread sight ;</l>
     <l n="582">And then he felt that , in sheer fright ,</l>
     <l n="583">He must take to his heels in flight ,</l>
     <l n="584">He cared not whither , so that it might be</l>
     <l n="585">Where there were no more bundles , cold and white ,</l>
     <l n="586">Like sheeted bodies , plain to see .</l>
     <l n="587">And , all on edge , he turned to chide</l>
     <l n="588">His sister , dragging at his side :</l>
     <l n="589">But , when he found that she was crying ,</l>
     <l n="590">Because her feet and hands were cold ,</l>
     <l n="591">He quite forgot to scold :</l>
     <l n="592">And spoke kind words of cheer to her :</l>
     <l n="593">And saw no more dead shepherds lying</l>
     <l n="594">In any snowy clump of heather .</l>
     <l n="595">So , hand in hand , they trudged together ,</l>
     <l n="596">Through that strange world of drifting gloam ,</l>
     <l n="597">Sharp-set and longing sore for home .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="40">
     <l n="598">And John remembered how that morning ,</l>
     <l n="599">When they set out the sky was blue —</l>
     <l n="600">Clean , cloudless blue ; and gave no warning ;</l>
     <l n="601">And how through air as clear as glass ,</l>
     <l n="602">The far-off hills he knew</l>
     <l n="603">Looked strangely near ; and glittered brightly ;</l>
     <l n="604">Each sprig of heath and blade of grass</l>
     <l n="605">In the cold wind blowing lightly ,</l>
     <l n="606">Each clump of green and crimson moss</l>
     <l n="607">Sparkling in the wintry sun .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="41">
     <l n="608">But now , as they toiled home , across</l>
     <l n="609">These unfamiliar fells , nigh done ,</l>
     <l n="610">The wind again began to blow ;</l>
     <l n="611">And thicker , thicker fell the snow :</l>
     <l n="612">Till Janey sank , too numb to stir :</l>
     <l n="613">When John stooped down , and lifted her ,</l>
     <l n="614">To carry her upon his back .</l>
     <l n="615">And then his head began to tire :</l>
     <l n="616">And soon he seemed to lose the track ...</l>
     <l n="617">And now the world was all afire ...</l>
     <l n="618">Now dazzling white , now dazzling black ...</l>
     <l n="619">And then , through some strange land of light ,</l>
     <l n="620">Where clouds of butterflies all white ,</l>
     <l n="621">Fluttered and flickered all about ,</l>
     <l n="622">Dancing ever in and out ,</l>
     <l n="623">He wandered , blinded by white wings ,</l>
     <l n="624">That rustled , rustled in his ears</l>
     <l n="625">With cold , uncanny whisperings ...</l>
     <l n="626">And then it seemed his bones must crack</l>
     <l n="627">With that dead weight upon his back ...</l>
     <l n="628">When , on his cheek , he felt warm tears ,</l>
     <l n="629">And a cold tangle of wet hair ;</l>
     <l n="630">And knew ‘ twas Janey weeping there :</l>
     <l n="631">And , taking heart , he stumbled on ,</l>
     <l n="632">While in his breast the hearthlight shone :</l>
     <l n="633">And it was all of his desire</l>
     <l n="634">To sit once more before the fire ;</l>
     <l n="635">And feel the friendly glowing heat .</l>
     <l n="636">But , as he strove with fumbling feet ,</l>
     <l n="637">It seemed that he would never find</l>
     <l n="638">Again that cheery hearth and kind ;</l>
     <l n="639">But wander ever , bent and blind ,</l>
     <l n="640">Beneath his burden through the night</l>
     <l n="641">Of dreadful , spangly , whispering white .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="42">
     <l n="642">The wind rose ; and the dry snow drifted</l>
     <l n="643">In little eddies round the track :</l>
     <l n="644">And when , at last , the dark cloud rifted ,</l>
     <l n="645">He saw a strange lough , lying cold and black ,</l>
     <l n="646">‘ Mid unknown , ghostly hills ; and knew</l>
     <l n="647">That they were lost : and once again ,</l>
     <l n="648">The snow closed in : and swept from view</l>
     <l n="649">The dead black water and strange fells .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="43">
     <l n="650">But still he struggled on : and then ,</l>
     <l n="651">When he seemed climbing up an endless steep</l>
     <l n="652">And ever slipping , sliding back ,</l>
     <l n="653">With ankles aching like to crack ,</l>
     <l n="654">And only longed for sleep ;</l>
     <l n="655">He heard a tinkling sound of bells ,</l>
     <l n="656">That kept on ringing , ringing , ringing ,</l>
     <l n="657">Until his dizzy head was singing ;</l>
     <l n="658">And he could think of nothing else :</l>
     <l n="659">And then it seemed the weight was lifted</l>
     <l n="660">From off his back ; and on the ground</l>
     <l n="661">His sister stood , while , all around</l>
     <l n="662">Were giants clad in coats of wool ,</l>
     <l n="663">With big , curled horns , and queer black faces ,</l>
     <l n="664">Who bobbed and curtsied in their places ,</l>
     <l n="665">With blazing eyes and strange grimaces ;</l>
     <l n="666">But never made a sound ;</l>
     <l n="667">Then nearly shook themselves to pieces ,</l>
     <l n="668">Shedding round a smell of warm , wet fleeces :</l>
     <l n="669">Then one it seemed as if he knew ,</l>
     <l n="670">Looking like the old lame ewe ,</l>
     <l n="671">Began to bite his coat , and pull</l>
     <l n="672">Till he could hardly stand : its eyes</l>
     <l n="673">Glowing to a monstrous size ,</l>
     <l n="674">Till they were like a lantern light</l>
     <l n="675">Burning brightly through the night ...</l>
     <l n="676">When someone stooped from out the sky ,</l>
     <l n="677">To rescue him ; and set him high :</l>
     <l n="678">And he was riding , snug and warm ,</l>
     <l n="679">In some king 's chariot through the storm ,</l>
     <l n="680">Without a sound of wheel or hoof —</l>
     <l n="681">In some king 's chariot , filled with straw ,</l>
     <l n="682">And he would nevermore be cold ...</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="44">
     <l n="683">And then with wondering eyes he saw</l>
     <l n="684">Deep caverns of pure burning gold ;</l>
     <l n="685">And knew himself in fairyland :</l>
     <l n="686">But when he stretched an eager hand</l>
     <l n="687">To touch the glowing walls , he felt</l>
     <l n="688">A queer warm puff , as though of fire ...</l>
     <l n="689">And suddenly he smelt</l>
     <l n="690">The reek of peat ; and looking higher ,</l>
     <l n="691">He saw the old , black porridge-kettle ,</l>
     <l n="692">Hanging from the cavern roof ,</l>
     <l n="693">Hanging on its own black crook :</l>
     <l n="694">And he was lying on the settle ,</l>
     <l n="695">While by his side ,</l>
     <l n="696">With tender look ,</l>
     <l n="697">His mother knelt ;</l>
     <l n="698">And he had only one desire</l>
     <l n="699">In all the world ; and ‘ twas to fling</l>
     <l n="700">His arms about her neck , and hide</l>
     <l n="701">His happy tears upon her breast .</l>
     <l n="702">And as to her he closely pressed ,</l>
     <l n="703">He heard his merry father sing :</l>
     <l n="704">“ There was a silly sleepyhead ,</l>
     <l n="705">Who thought he 'd like to go to bed :</l>
     <l n="706">So in a stell he went to sleep ,</l>
     <l n="707">And snored among the other sheep . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="45">
     <l n="708">And then his mother gently said :</l>
     <l n="709">“ Nay , father : do not tease him now :</l>
     <l n="710">He 's quite worn out : and needs a deal</l>
     <l n="711">Of quiet sleep : and , after all ,</l>
     <l n="712">He brought his sister safe from school . ”</l>
     <l n="713">And now he felt her warm tears fall</l>
     <l n="714">Upon his cheek : and thrilled to feel</l>
     <l n="715">His father 's hand on his hot brow ,</l>
     <l n="716">And hear him say : “ The lad 's no fool . ”</l>

     <l n="847">Without an unfulfilled desire ,</l>
     <l n="848">His grateful body drinking in</l>
     <l n="849">Warm , blessed , snug forgetfulness .</l>
     <l n="850">And yet , with staring eyes awake ,</l>
     <l n="851">As though no drench of heat could slake</l>
     <l n="852">His thirst for fire , he watched a red</l>
     <l n="853">Hot eye that burned within a chink</l>
     <l n="854">Between the bricks : while overhead</l>
     <l n="855">The quivering stream of hot , gold air</l>
     <l n="856">Surged up to quench the cold starlight .</l>
     <l n="857">His brain , too numbed and dull to think</l>
     <l n="858">Throughout the day , in that fierce glare</l>
     <l n="859">Awoke , at last , with startled stare</l>
     <l n="860">Of pitiless , insistent sight</l>
     <l n="861">That stript the stark , mean , bitter strife</l>
     <l n="862">Of his poor , broken , wasted life ,</l>
     <l n="863">Crippled from birth , and struggling on ,</l>
     <l n="864">The last , least shred of hope long gone ,</l>
     <l n="865">To some unknown , black , bitter end .</l>
     <l n="866">But , even as he looked , his brain</l>
     <l n="867">Sank back to sightless sloth again ;</l>
     <l n="868">Then , all at once , he seemed to choke ;</l>
     <l n="869">And knew it was the stealthy stife</l>
     <l n="870">And deadly fume of burning coke</l>
     <l n="871">That filled his lungs , and seemed to soak</l>
     <l n="872">Through every pore , until the blood</l>
     <l n="873">Grew thick and heavy in his veins ,</l>
     <l n="874">And he could scarcely draw a breath .</l>
     <l n="875">He lay , and murmured drowsily ,</l>
     <l n="876">With closing eyes : “ If this be death ,</l>
     <l n="877">It 's snug and easy ... let it come ...</l>
     <l n="878">For life is cold and hard ... the flood</l>
     <l n="879">Is rising with the heavy rains</l>
     <l n="880">That pour and pour ... that damned old drum ,</l>
     <l n="881">Why ever can n't they let it be ...</l>
     <l n="882">Beat-beating , beating , beating , beat ... ”</l>
     <l n="883">Then , suddenly , he sat upright ,</l>
     <l n="884">For , close behind him in the night ,</l>
     <l n="885">He heard a breathing loud and deep ,</l>
     <l n="886">And caught a whiff of burning leather .</l>
     <l n="887">He shook himself alive , and turned ;</l>
     <l n="888">And on a heap of ashes white ,</l>
     <l n="889">O'ercome by the full blast of heat ,</l>
     <l n="890">Where fieriest the dread blaze burned ,</l>
     <l n="891">He saw a young girl stretched in sleep .</l>
     <l n="892">He sat awhile with heavy gaze</l>
     <l n="893">Fixed on her in a dull amaze ,</l>
     <l n="894">Until he saw her scorched boots smoking :</l>
     <l n="895">Then , whispering huskily : “ She 's dying ,</l>
     <l n="896">While I look on and watch her choking ! ”</l>
     <l n="897">He roused : and pulled himself together :</l>
     <l n="898">And rose , and went where she was lying :</l>
     <l n="899">And , bending o'er the senseless lass ,</l>
     <l n="900">In his weak arms he lifted her ;</l>
     <l n="901">And bore her out beyond the glare ,</l>
     <l n="902">Beyond the stealthy , stifling gas ,</l>
     <l n="903">Into the fresh and eager air :</l>
     <l n="904">And laid her gently on the ground</l>
     <l n="905">Beneath the cold and starry sky :</l>
     <l n="906">And did his best to bring her round ;</l>
     <l n="907">Though still , for all that he could try ,</l>
     <l n="908">She seemed , with each deep-labouring breath</l>
     <l n="909">Just brought up on the brink of death .</l>
     <l n="910">He sought , and found an icy pool ,</l>
     <l n="911">Though he had but a cap to fill ,</l>
     <l n="912">And bathed her hands and face , until</l>
     <l n="913">The troubled breath was quieter ,</l>
     <l n="914">And her flushed forehead felt quite cool :</l>
     <l n="915">And then he saw an eyelid stir ;</l>
     <l n="916">And shivering she sat up at last ,</l>
     <l n="917">And looked about her sullenly .</l>
     <l n="918">“ I 'm cold ... I 'm mortal cold , ” she said :</l>
     <l n="919">“ What call had you to waken me ?</l>
     <l n="920">I was so warm and happy , dead ...</l>
     <l n="921">And still those staring stars ! ” Her head</l>
     <l n="922">Dropt in her hands : and thick and fast</l>
     <l n="923">The tears came with a heavy sobbing .</l>
     <l n="924">He stood quite helpless while she cried ;</l>
     <l n="925">And watched her shaken bosom throbbing</l>
     <l n="926">With passionate , wild , weak distress ,</l>
     <l n="927">Till it was spent . And then she dried</l>
     <l n="928">Her eyes upon her singed black dress ;</l>
     <l n="929">Looked up , and saw him standing there ,</l>
     <l n="930">Wondering , and more than half-afraid .</l>
     <l n="931">But now , the nipping , hungry air</l>
     <l n="932">Took hold of her , and struck fear dead .</l>
     <l n="933">She only felt the starving sting</l>
     <l n="934">That must , at any price , be stayed ;</l>
     <l n="935">And cried out : “ I am famishing ! ”</l>
     <l n="936">Then from his pocket he took bread</l>
     <l n="937">That he had been too weak and sick</l>
     <l n="938">To eat o'ernight : and eager-eyed ,</l>
     <l n="939">She took it timidly ; and said :</l>
     <l n="940">“ I have not tasted food two days . ”</l>
     <l n="941">And , as he waited by her side ,</l>
     <l n="942">He watched her with a quiet gaze ;</l>
     <l n="943">And saw her munch the broken crust</l>
     <l n="944">So gladly , seated in the dust</l>
     <l n="945">Of that black desert 's bitter night ,</l>
     <l n="946">Beneath the freezing stars , so white</l>
     <l n="947">And hunger-pinched : and at the sight</l>
     <l n="948">Keen pity touched him to the quick ;</l>
     <l n="949">Although he never said a word ,</l>
     <l n="950">Till she had finished every crumb .</l>
     <l n="951">And then he led her to a seat</l>
     <l n="952">A little closer to the heat ,</l>
     <l n="953">But well beyond the deadly stife .</l>
     <l n="954">And in the ashes , side by side ,</l>
     <l n="955">They sat together , dazed and dumb ,</l>
     <l n="956">With eyes upon the ovens ’ glare ,</l>
     <l n="957">Each looking nakedly on life .</l>
     <l n="958">And then , at length , she sighed , and stirred ,</l>
     <l n="959">Still staring deep and dreamy-eyed</l>
     <l n="960">Into the whitening , steady glow .</l>
     <l n="961">With jerky , broken words and slow ,</l>
     <l n="962">And biting at her finger-ends ,</l>
     <l n="963">She talked at last : and spoke out all</l>
     <l n="964">Quite open-heartedly , as though</l>
     <l n="965">There were not any stranger there —</l>
     <l n="966">The fire and he , both bosom-friends .</l>
     <l n="967">She 'd left her home three months ago —</l>
     <l n="968">She , country-born and country-bred ,</l>
     <l n="969">Had got the notion in her head</l>
     <l n="970">That she 'd like city-service best ...</l>
     <l n="971">And so no country place could please ...</l>
     <l n="972">And she had worried without rest</l>
     <l n="973">Until , at last , she got her ends ;</l>
     <l n="974">And , wiser than her folk and friends ,</l>
     <l n="975">She left her home among the trees ...</l>
     <l n="976">The trees grew thick for miles about</l>
     <l n="977">Her father 's house ... the forest spread</l>
     <l n="978">As far as ever you could see ...</l>
     <l n="979">And it was green , in Summer , green ...</l>
     <l n="980">Since she had left her home , she 'd seen</l>
     <l n="981">No greenness could compare with it ...</l>
     <l n="982">And everything was fresh and clean ,</l>
     <l n="983">And not all smutched and smirched with smoke</l>
     <l n="984">They burned no sooty coal and coke ,</l>
     <l n="985">But only wood-logs , ash and oak ...</l>
     <l n="986">And by the fire at night they 'd sit ...</l>
     <l n="987">Ah ! would n't it be rare and good</l>
     <l n="988">To smell the sappy , sizzling wood ,</l>
     <l n="989">Once more ; and listen to the stream</l>
     <l n="990">That runs just by the garden-gate ...</l>
     <l n="991">And often , in a Winter spate ,</l>
     <l n="992">She 'd wakened from a troubled dream ,</l>
     <l n="993">And lain in bed , and heard it roar ;</l>
     <l n="994">And quaked to hear it , as a child ...</l>
     <l n="995">It seemed so angry , and so wild —</l>
     <l n="996">Just mad to sweep the house away !</l>
     <l n="997">And now , it was three months or more</l>
     <l n="998">Since she had heard it , on the day ...</l>
     <l n="999">The day she left ... and Michael stood ...</l>
     <l n="1000">He was a woodman , too , and he</l>
     <l n="1001">Worked with her father in the wood ...</l>
     <l n="1002">And wanted her , she knew ... but she</l>
     <l n="1003">Was proud , and thought herself too good</l>
     <l n="1004">To marry any country lad ...</l>
     <l n="1005">‘ Twas queer to think she 'd once been proud —</l>
     <l n="1006">And such a little while ago —</l>
     <l n="1007">A beggar , wolfing crusts ! ... The pride</l>
     <l n="1008">That made her quit her countryside</l>
     <l n="1009">Soon left her stranded in the crowd ...</l>
     <l n="1010">And precious little pride she had</l>
     <l n="1011">To keep her warm these freezing days</l>
     <l n="1012">Since she had fled the city-ways</l>
     <l n="1013">To walk back home ... aye ! home again :</l>
     <l n="1014">For , in the town , she 'd tried in vain ,</l>
     <l n="1015">For honest work to earn her bread ...</l>
     <l n="1016">At one place , they 'd nigh slaved her dead ,</l>
     <l n="1017">And starved her , too ; and , when she left ,</l>
     <l n="1018">Had cheated her of half her wage :</l>
     <l n="1019">But she 'd no means to stop the theft ...</l>
     <l n="1020">And she 'd had no more work to do ...</l>
     <l n="1021">Two months since , now ... it seemed an age !</l>
     <l n="1022">How she had lived , she scarcely knew ...</l>
     <l n="1023">And still , poor fool , too proud to write</l>
     <l n="1024">To home for help , until , at length ,</l>
     <l n="1025">She 'd not a penny for a bite ,</l>
     <l n="1026">Or pride enough to clothe her back ...</l>
     <l n="1027">So , she was tramping home , too poor</l>
     <l n="1028">To pay the train-fare ... she 'd the strength ,</l>
     <l n="1029">If she 'd the food ... but that hard track ,</l>
     <l n="1030">And that cold , cruel , bitter night</l>
     <l n="1031">Had taken all the heart from her ...</l>
     <l n="1032">If Michael knew , she felt quite sure ...</l>
     <l n="1033">For she would rather drop stone-dead</l>
     <l n="1034">Than live as some ... if she had cared</l>
     <l n="1035">To feed upon the devil 's bread ,</l>
     <l n="1036">She could have earned it easily ...</l>
     <l n="1037">She 'd pride enough to starve instead ,</l>
     <l n="1038">Aye , starve , than fare as some girls fared ...</l>
     <l n="1039">But , that was all behind ... and she</l>
     <l n="1040">Was going home ... and yet , maybe ,</l>
     <l n="1041">If they 'd a home like hers , they , too ,</l>
     <l n="1042">Would be too proud ... she only knew</l>
     <l n="1043">The thought of home had kept her straight ,</l>
     <l n="1044">And saved her ere it was too late .</l>
     <l n="1045">She 'd soon be home again ...</l>
     <l n="1046">And now</l>
     <l n="1047">She sat with hand upon her brow ;</l>
     <l n="1048">And did not speak again nor stir .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="58">
     <l n="1049">And , as he heard her words , his gaze</l>
     <l n="1050">Still set upon the steady glare ,</l>
     <l n="1051">His thoughts turned back to city-ways :</l>
     <l n="1052">And he remembered common sights</l>
     <l n="1053">That he had seen in city nights :</l>
     <l n="1054">And , once again , in early June ,</l>
     <l n="1055">He wandered through the midnight street ;</l>
     <l n="1056">And heard those ever-pacing feet</l>
     <l n="1057">Of young girls , children yet in years ,</l>
     <l n="1058">With gaudy ribbons in their hair ,</l>
     <l n="1059">And shameless fevered eyes astare ,</l>
     <l n="1060">And slack lips set in brazen leers ,</l>
     <l n="1061">Who walked the pavements of despair ,</l>
     <l n="1062">Beneath the fair full Summer moon ...</l>
     <l n="1063">Shadowed by worn-out , wizened hags ,</l>
     <l n="1064">With claw-hands clutching filthy rags</l>
     <l n="1065">About old bosoms , shrunk and thin ,</l>
     <l n="1066">And mouths aleer without a tooth ,</l>
     <l n="1067">Who dogged them , cursing their sleek youth</l>
     <l n="1068">That filched their custom and their bread ...</l>
     <l n="1069">Then , in a reek of hot gas light ,</l>
     <l n="1070">He stood where , through the Summer night ,</l>
     <l n="1071">Half-dozing in the stifling air ,</l>
     <l n="1072">The greasy landlord , fat with sin ,</l>
     <l n="1073">Sat , lolling in his easy chair ,</l>
     <l n="1074">Just half-way up the brothel stair ,</l>
     <l n="1075">To tax the earnings they brought in ,</l>
     <l n="1076">And hearken for the policeman 's tread ...</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="59">
     <l n="1077">Then , shuddering back from that foul place</l>
     <l n="1078">And turning from the ovens ’ glare ,</l>
     <l n="1079">He looked into her dreaming face ;</l>
     <l n="1080">And saw green , sunlit woodlands there ,</l>
     <l n="1081">And waters flashing in between</l>
     <l n="1082">Low-drooping boughs of Summer green .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="60">
     <l n="1083">And as he looked , still in a dream</l>
     <l n="1084">She murmured : “ Michael would , she knew ...</l>
     <l n="1085">Though she 'd been foolish ... he was true ,</l>
     <l n="1086">As true as steel , and fond of her ...</l>
     <l n="1087">And then she sat with eyes agleam</l>
     <l n="1088">In dreaming silence , till the stir</l>
     <l n="1089">Of cold dawn shivered through the air :</l>
     <l n="1090">When , twisting up her tumbled hair ,</l>
     <l n="1091">She rose ; and said , she must be gone .</l>
     <l n="1092">Though she 'd still far to go , the day</l>
     <l n="1093">Would see her well upon her way ...</l>
     <l n="1094">And she had best be jogging on ,</l>
     <l n="1095">While she 'd the strength ... and so , “ Good-bye . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="61">
     <l n="1096">And as , beneath the paling sky ,</l>
     <l n="1097">He trudged again the cinder-track</l>
     <l n="1098">That stretched before him , dead and black ,</l>
     <l n="1099">He muttered : “ It 's a chance the light</l>
     <l n="1100">Has found me living still ... and she —</l>
     <l n="1101">She , too ... and Michael ... and through me</l>
     <l n="1102">God knows whom I may wake to-night . ”</l>
