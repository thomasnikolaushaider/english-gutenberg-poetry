    <docImprint><settlement>LONDON</settlement>: WILLIAM HEINEMANN Dans la trêve désolée de cette matinée , ces hommes qui avaient été tenaillés par la fatigue , fouettés par la pluie , bouleversés par toute une nuit de tonnerre , ces rescapés des volcans et de l'inondation entrevoyaient à quel point la guerre , aussi hideuse au moral qu'au physique , non seulement viole le bon sens , avilit les grandes idées , commande tous les crimes — mais ils se rappelaient combien elle avait développé en eux et autour d'eux tous les mauvais instincts sans en excepter un seul ; la méchanceté jusqu'au sadisme , l'égoïsme jusqu'à la férocité , le besoin de jouir jusqu'à la folie . HENRI BARBUSSE . ( Le Feu . ) NOTE Of these 64 poems , 12 are now published for the first time . The remainder are selected from two previous volumes .</docImprint>

    <head>PRELUDE : THE TROOPS</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Dim , gradual thinning of the shapeless gloom</l>
     <l n="2">Shudders to drizzling daybreak that reveals</l>
     <l n="3">Disconsolate men who stamp their sodden boots</l>
     <l n="4">And turn dulled , sunken faces to the sky</l>
     <l n="5">Haggard and hopeless . They , who have beaten down</l>
     <l n="6">The stale despair of night , must now renew</l>
     <l n="7">Their desolation in the truce of dawn ,</l>
     <l n="8">Murdering the livid hours that grope for peace .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">Yet these , who cling to life with stubborn hands ,</l>
     <l n="10">Can grin through storms of death and find a gap</l>
     <l n="11">In the clawed , cruel tangles of his defence .</l>
     <l n="12">They march from safety , and the bird-sung joy</l>
     <l n="13">Of grass-green thickets , to the land where all</l>
     <l n="14">Is ruin , and nothing blossoms but the sky</l>
     <l n="15">That hastens over them where they endure</l>
     <l n="16">Sad , smoking , flat horizons , reeking woods ,</l>
     <l n="17">And foundered trench-lines volleying doom for doom .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="18">O my brave brown companions , when your souls</l>
     <l n="19">Flock silently away , and the eyeless dead ,</l>
     <l n="20">Shame the wild beast of battle on the ridge ,</l>
     <l n="21">Death will stand grieving in that field of war</l>
     <l n="22">Since your unvanquished hardihood is spent .</l>
     <l n="23">And through some mooned Valhalla there will pass</l>
     <l n="24">Battalions and battalions , scarred from hell ;</l>
     <l n="25">The unreturning army that was youth ;</l>
     <l n="26">The legions who have suffered and are dust .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>DREAMERS</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Soldiers are citizens of death 's gray land ,</l>
     <l n="2">Drawing no dividend from time 's to-morrows .</l>
     <l n="3">In the great hour of destiny they stand ,</l>
     <l n="4">Each with his feuds , and jealousies , and sorrows .</l>
     <l n="5">Soldiers are sworn to action ; they must win</l>
     <l n="6">Some flaming , fatal climax with their lives .</l>
     <l n="7">Soldiers are dreamers ; when the guns begin</l>
     <l n="8">They think of firelit homes , clean beds , and wives .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">I see them in foul dug-outs , gnawed by rats ,</l>
     <l n="10">And in the ruined trenches , lashed with rain ,</l>
     <l n="11">Dreaming of things they did with balls and bats ,</l>
     <l n="12">And mocked by hopeless longing to regain</l>
     <l n="13">Bank-holidays , and picture shows , and spats ,</l>
     <l n="14">And going to the office in the train .</l>
    </lg>

   <lg type="poem">
    <head>THE REDEEMER</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Darkness : the rain sluiced down ; the mire was deep ;</l>
     <l n="2">It was past twelve on a mid-winter night ,</l>
     <l n="3">When peaceful folk in beds lay snug asleep :</l>
     <l n="4">There , with much work to do before the light ,</l>
     <l n="5">We lugged our clay-sucked boots as best we might</l>
     <l n="6">Along the trench ; sometimes a bullet sang ,</l>
     <l n="7">And droning shells burst with a hollow bang ;</l>
     <l n="8">We were soaked , chilled and wretched , every one .</l>
     <l n="9">Darkness : the distant wink of a huge gun .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="10">I turned in the black ditch , loathing the storm ;</l>
     <l n="11">A rocket fizzed and burned with blanching flare ,</l>
     <l n="12">And lit the face of what had been a form</l>
     <l n="13">Floundering in mirk . He stood before me there ;</l>
     <l n="14">I say that he was Christ ; stiff in the glare ,</l>
     <l n="15">And leaning forward from his burdening task ,</l>
     <l n="16">Both arms supporting it ; his eyes on mine</l>
     <l n="17">Stared from the woeful head that seemed a mask</l>
     <l n="18">Of mortal pain in Hell 's unholy shine .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="19">No thorny crown , only a woollen cap</l>
     <l n="20">He wore — an English soldier , white and strong ,</l>
     <l n="21">Who loved his time like any simple chap ,</l>
     <l n="22">Good days of work and sport and homely song ;</l>
     <l n="23">Now he has learned that nights are very long ,</l>
     <l n="24">And dawn a watching of the windowed sky .</l>
     <l n="25">But to the end , unjudging , he 'll endure</l>
     <l n="26">Horror and pain , not uncontent to die</l>
     <l n="27">That Lancaster on Lune may stand secure .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="28">He faced me , reeling in his weariness ,</l>
     <l n="29">Shouldering his load of planks , so hard to bear .</l>
     <l n="30">I say that he was Christ , who wrought to bless</l>
     <l n="31">All groping things with freedom bright as air ,</l>
     <l n="32">And with His mercy washed and made them fair .</l>
     <l n="33">Then the flame sank , and all grew black as pitch ,</l>
     <l n="34">While we began to struggle along the ditch ;</l>
     <l n="35">And some one flung his burden in the muck ,</l>
     <l n="36">Mumbling : “ O Christ Almighty , now I 'm stuck ! ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>TRENCH DUTY</head>
     <l n="1">Shaken from sleep , and numbed and scarce awake ,</l>
     <l n="2">Out in the trench with three hours ’ watch to take ,</l>
     <l n="3">I blunder through the splashing mirk ; and then</l>
     <l n="4">Hear the gruff muttering voices of the men</l>
     <l n="5">Crouching in cabins candle-chinked with light .</l>
     <l n="6">Hark ! There 's the big bombardment on our right</l>
     <l n="7">Rumbling and bumping ; and the dark 's a glare</l>
     <l n="8">Of flickering horror in the sectors where</l>
     <l n="9">We raid the Boche ; men waiting , stiff and chilled ,</l>
     <l n="10">Or crawling on their bellies through the wire .</l>
     <l n="11">“ What ? Stretcher-bearers wanted ? Some one killed ? ”</l>
     <l n="12">Five minutes ago I heard a sniper fire :</l>
     <l n="13">Why did he do it ?... Starlight overhead —</l>
     <l n="14">Blank stars . I 'm wide-awake ; and some chap 's dead .</l>
   </lg>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>WIRERS</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ Pass it along , the wiring party 's going out ” —</l>
     <l n="2">And yawning sentries mumble , “ Wirers going out . ”</l>
     <l n="3">Unravelling ; twisting ; hammering stakes with muffled thud ,</l>
     <l n="4">They toil with stealthy haste and anger in their blood .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">The Boche sends up a flare . Black forms stand rigid there ,</l>
     <l n="6">Stock-still like posts ; then darkness , and the clumsy ghosts</l>
     <l n="7">Stride hither and thither , whispering , tripped by clutching snare</l>
     <l n="8">Of snags and tangles .</l>
     <l n="9">Ghastly dawn with vaporous coasts</l>
     <l n="10">Gleams desolate along the sky , night 's misery ended .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="11">Young Hughes was badly hit ; I heard him carried away ,</l>
     <l n="12">Moaning at every lurch ; no doubt he 'll die to-day .</l>
     <l n="13">But we can say the front-line wire 's been safely mended .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>BREAK OF DAY</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">There seemed a smell of autumn in the air</l>
     <l n="2">At the bleak end of night ; he shivered there</l>
     <l n="3">In a dank , musty dug-out where he lay ,</l>
     <l n="4">Legs wrapped in sand-bags ,— lumps of chalk and clay</l>
     <l n="5">Spattering his face . Dry-mouthed , he thought , “ To-day</l>
     <l n="6">We start the damned attack ; and , Lord knows why ,</l>
     <l n="7">Zero 's at nine ; how bloody if I 'm done in</l>
     <l n="8">Under the freedom of that morning sky ! ”</l>
     <l n="9">And then he coughed and dozed , cursing the din .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="10">Was it the ghost of autumn in that smell</l>
     <l n="11">Of underground , or God 's blank heart grown kind ,</l>
     <l n="12">That sent a happy dream to him in hell ?—</l>
     <l n="13">Where men are crushed like clods , and crawl to find</l>
     <l n="14">Some crater for their wretchedness ; who lie</l>
     <l n="15">In outcast immolation , doomed to die</l>
     <l n="16">Far from clean things or any hope of cheer ,</l>
     <l n="17">Cowed anger in their eyes , till darkness brims</l>
     <l n="18">And roars into their heads , and they can hear</l>
     <l n="19">Old childish talk , and tags of foolish hymns .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="20">He sniffs the chilly air ; ( his dreaming starts ) .</l>
     <l n="21">He 's riding in a dusty Sussex lane</l>
     <l n="22">In quiet September ; slowly night departs ;</l>
     <l n="23">And he 's a living soul , absolved from pain .</l>
     <l n="24">Beyond the brambled fences where he goes</l>
     <l n="25">Are glimmering fields with harvest piled in sheaves ,</l>
     <l n="26">And tree-tops dark against the stars grown pale ;</l>
     <l n="27">Then , clear and shrill , a distant farm-cock crows ;</l>
     <l n="28">And there 's a wall of mist along the vale</l>
     <l n="29">Where willows shake their watery-sounding leaves .</l>
     <l n="30">He gazes on it all , and scarce believes</l>
     <l n="31">That earth is telling its old peaceful tale ;</l>
     <l n="32">He thanks the blessed world that he was born ....</l>
     <l n="33">Then , far away , a lonely note of the horn .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="34">They 're drawing the Big Wood ! Unlatch the gate ,</l>
     <l n="35">And set Golumpus going on the grass :</l>
     <l n="36">He knows the corner where it 's best to wait</l>
     <l n="37">And hear the crashing woodland chorus pass ;</l>
     <l n="38">The corner where old foxes make their track</l>
     <l n="39">To the Long Spinney ; that 's the place to be .</l>
     <l n="40">The bracken shakes below an ivied tree ,</l>
     <l n="41">And then a cub looks out ; and “ Tally-o-back ! ”</l>
     <l n="42">He bawls , and swings his thong with volleying crack ,—</l>
     <l n="43">All the clean thrill of autumn in his blood ,</l>
     <l n="44">And hunting surging through him like a flood</l>
     <l n="45">In joyous welcome from the untroubled past ;</l>
     <l n="46">While the war drifts away , forgotten at last .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="47">Now a red , sleepy sun above the rim</l>
     <l n="48">Of twilight stares along the quiet weald ,</l>
     <l n="49">And the kind , simple country shines revealed</l>
     <l n="50">In solitudes of peace , no longer dim .</l>
     <l n="51">The old horse lifts his face and thanks the light ,</l>
     <l n="52">Then stretches down his head to crop the green .</l>
     <l n="53">All things that he has loved are in his sight ;</l>
     <l n="54">The places where his happiness has been</l>
     <l n="55">Are in his eyes , his heart , and they are good .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="56">Hark ! there 's the horn : they 're drawing the Big Wood .</l>

    <head>A WORKING PARTY</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Three hours ago he blundered up the trench ,</l>
     <l n="2">Sliding and poising , groping with his boots ;</l>
     <l n="3">Sometimes he tripped and lurched against the walls</l>
     <l n="4">With hands that pawed the sodden bags of chalk .</l>
     <l n="5">He could n't see the man who walked in front ;</l>
     <l n="6">Only he heard the drum and rattle of feet</l>
     <l n="7">Stepping along the trench-boards ,— often splashing</l>
     <l n="8">Wretchedly where the sludge was ankle-deep .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">Voices would grunt , “ Keep to your right ,— make way ! ”</l>
     <l n="10">When squeezing past the men from the front-line :</l>
     <l n="11">White faces peered , puffing a point of red ;</l>
     <l n="12">Candles and braziers glinted through the chinks</l>
     <l n="13">And curtain-flaps of dug-outs ; then the gloom</l>
     <l n="14">Swallowed his sense of sight ; he stooped and swore</l>
     <l n="15">Because a sagging wire had caught his neck .</l>
     <l n="16">A flare went up ; the shining whiteness spread</l>
     <l n="17">And flickered upward , showing nimble rats ,</l>
     <l n="18">And mounds of glimmering sand-bags , bleached with rain ;</l>
     <l n="19">Then the slow , silver moment died in dark .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="20">The wind came posting by with chilly gusts</l>
     <l n="21">And buffeting at corners , piping thin</l>
     <l n="22">And dreary through the crannies ; rifle-shots</l>
     <l n="23">Would split and crack and sing along the night ,</l>
     <l n="24">And shells came calmly through the drizzling air</l>
     <l n="25">To burst with hollow bang below the hill .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="26">Three hours ago he stumbled up the trench ;</l>
     <l n="27">Now he will never walk that road again :</l>
     <l n="28">He must be carried back , a jolting lump</l>
     <l n="29">Beyond all need of tenderness and care ;</l>
     <l n="30">A nine-stone corpse with nothing more to do .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="31">He was a young man with a meagre wife</l>
     <l n="32">And two pale children in a Midland town ;</l>
     <l n="33">He showed the photograph to all his mates ;</l>
     <l n="34">And they considered him a decent chap</l>
     <l n="35">Who did his work and had n't much to say ,</l>
     <l n="36">And always laughed at other people 's jokes</l>
     <l n="37">Because he had n't any of his own .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="38">That night , when he was busy at his job</l>
     <l n="39">Of piling bags along the parapet ,</l>
     <l n="40">He thought how slow time went , stamping his feet ,</l>
     <l n="41">And blowing on his fingers , pinched with cold .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="42">He thought of getting back by half-past twelve ,</l>
     <l n="43">And tot of rum to send him warm to sleep</l>
     <l n="44">In draughty dug-out frowsty with the fumes</l>
     <l n="45">Of coke , and full of snoring , weary men .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="46">He pushed another bag along the top ,</l>

     <l n="34">Crumpled and spun him sideways , knocked him out</l>
     <l n="35">To grunt and wriggle : none heeded him ; he choked</l>
