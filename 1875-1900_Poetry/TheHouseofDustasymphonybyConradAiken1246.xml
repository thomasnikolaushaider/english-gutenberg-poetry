     <head>I .</head>
     <lg type="stanza" n="1">
      <l n="1">The sun goes down in a cold pale flare of light .</l>
      <l n="2">The trees grow dark : the shadows lean to the east :</l>
      <l n="3">And lights wink out through the windows , one by one .</l>
      <l n="4">A clamor of frosty sirens mourns at the night .</l>
      <l n="5">Pale slate-grey clouds whirl up from the sunken sun .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="2">
      <l n="6">And the wandering one , the inquisitive dreamer of dreams ,</l>
      <l n="7">The eternal asker of answers , stands in the street ,</l>
      <l n="8">And lifts his palms for the first cold ghost of rain .</l>
      <l n="9">The purple lights leap down the hill before him .</l>
      <l n="10">The gorgeous night has begun again .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="3">
      <l n="11">‘ I will ask them all , I will ask them all their dreams ,</l>
      <l n="12">I will hold my light above them and seek their faces .</l>
      <l n="13">I will hear them whisper , invisible in their veins . . . ’</l>
      <l n="14">The eternal asker of answers becomes as the darkness ,</l>
      <l n="15">Or as a wind blown over a myriad forest ,</l>
      <l n="16">Or as the numberless voices of long-drawn rains .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="4">
      <l n="17">We hear him and take him among us , like a wind of music ,</l>
      <l n="18">Like the ghost of a music we have somewhere heard ;</l>
      <l n="19">We crowd through the streets in a dazzle of pallid lamplight ,</l>
      <l n="20">We pour in a sinister wave , ascend a stair ,</l>
      <l n="21">With laughter and cry , and word upon murmured word ;</l>
      <l n="22">We flow , we descend , we turn . . . and the eternal dreamer</l>
      <l n="23">Moves among us like light , like evening air . . .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="5">
      <l n="24">Good-night ! Good-night ! Good-night ! We go our ways ,</l>
      <l n="25">The rain runs over the pavement before our feet ,</l>
      <l n="26">The cold rain falls , the rain sings .</l>
      <l n="27">We walk , we run , we ride . We turn our faces</l>
      <l n="28">To what the eternal evening brings .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="6">
      <l n="29">Our hands are hot and raw with the stones we have laid ,</l>
      <l n="30">We have built a tower of stone high into the sky ,</l>
      <l n="31">We have built a city of towers .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="7">
      <l n="32">Our hands are light , they are singing with emptiness .</l>
      <l n="33">Our souls are light ; they have shaken a burden of hours . . .</l>
      <l n="34">What did we build it for ? Was it all a dream ? . . .</l>
      <l n="35">Ghostly above us in lamplight the towers gleam . . .</l>
      <l n="36">And after a while they will fall to dust and rain ;</l>
      <l n="37">Or else we will tear them down with impatient hands ;</l>
      <l n="38">And hew rock out of the earth , and build them again .</l>

     <lg type="stanza" n="8">
      <l n="39">One , from his high bright window in a tower ,</l>
      <l n="40">Leans out , as evening falls ,</l>
      <l n="41">And sees the advancing curtain of the shower</l>
      <l n="42">Splashing its silver on roofs and walls :</l>
      <l n="43">Sees how , swift as a shadow , it crosses the city ,</l>
      <l n="44">And murmurs beyond far walls to the sea ,</l>
      <l n="45">Leaving a glimmer of water in the dark canyons ,</l>
      <l n="46">And silver falling from eave and tree .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="9">
      <l n="47">One , from his high bright window , looking down ,</l>
      <l n="48">Peers like a dreamer over the rain-bright town ,</l>
      <l n="49">And thinks its towers are like a dream .</l>
      <l n="50">The western windows flame in the sun 's last flare ,</l>
      <l n="51">Pale roofs begin to gleam .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="10">
      <l n="52">Looking down from a window high in a wall</l>
      <l n="53">He sees us all ;</l>
      <l n="54">Lifting our pallid faces towards the rain ,</l>
      <l n="55">Searching the sky , and going our ways again ,</l>
      <l n="56">Standing in doorways , waiting under the trees . . .</l>
      <l n="57">There , in the high bright window he dreams , and sees</l>
      <l n="58">What we are blind to ,— we who mass and crowd</l>
      <l n="59">From wall to wall in the darkening of a cloud .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="11">
      <l n="60">The gulls drift slowly above the city of towers ,</l>
      <l n="61">Over the roofs to the darkening sea they fly ;</l>
      <l n="62">Night falls swiftly on an evening of rain .</l>
      <l n="63">The yellow lamps wink one by one again .</l>
      <l n="64">The towers reach higher and blacker against the sky .</l>

     <head>III .</head>
     <lg type="stanza" n="12">
      <l n="65">One , where the pale sea foamed at the yellow sand ,</l>
      <l n="66">With wave upon slowly shattering wave ,</l>
      <l n="67">Turned to the city of towers as evening fell ;</l>
      <l n="68">And slowly walked by the darkening road toward it ;</l>
      <l n="69">And saw how the towers darkened against the sky ;</l>
      <l n="70">And across the distance heard the toll of a bell .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="13">
      <l n="71">Along the darkening road he hurried alone ,</l>
      <l n="72">With his eyes cast down ,</l>
      <l n="73">And thought how the streets were hoarse with a tide of people ,</l>
      <l n="74">With clamor of voices , and numberless faces . . .</l>
      <l n="75">And it seemed to him , of a sudden , that he would drown</l>
      <l n="76">Here in the quiet of evening air ,</l>
      <l n="77">These empty and voiceless places . . .</l>
      <l n="78">And he hurried towards the city , to enter there .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="14">
      <l n="79">Along the darkening road , between tall trees</l>
      <l n="80">That made a sinister whisper , loudly he walked .</l>
      <l n="81">Behind him , sea-gulls dipped over long grey seas .</l>
      <l n="82">Before him , numberless lovers smiled and talked .</l>
      <l n="83">And death was observed with sudden cries ,</l>
      <l n="84">And birth with laughter and pain .</l>
      <l n="85">And the trees grew taller and blacker against the skies</l>
      <l n="86">And night came down again .</l>

    <lg type="part" n="4">
     <head>IV .</head>
     <lg type="stanza" n="15">
      <l n="87">Up high black walls , up sombre terraces ,</l>
      <l n="88">Clinging like luminous birds to the sides of cliffs ,</l>
      <l n="89">The yellow lights went climbing towards the sky .</l>
      <l n="90">From high black walls , gleaming vaguely with rain ,</l>
      <l n="91">Each yellow light looked down like a golden eye .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="16">
      <l n="92">They trembled from coign to coign , and tower to tower ,</l>
      <l n="93">Along high terraces quicker than dream they flew .</l>
      <l n="94">And some of them steadily glowed , and some soon vanished ,</l>
      <l n="95">And some strange shadows threw .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="17">
      <l n="96">And behind them all the ghosts of thoughts went moving ,</l>
      <l n="97">Restlessly moving in each lamplit room ,</l>
      <l n="98">From chair to mirror , from mirror to fire ;</l>
      <l n="99">From some , the light was scarcely more than a gloom :</l>
      <l n="100">From some , a dazzling desire .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="18">
      <l n="101">And there was one , beneath black eaves , who thought ,</l>
      <l n="102">Combing with lifted arms her golden hair ,</l>
      <l n="103">Of the lover who hurried towards her through the night ;</l>
      <l n="104">And there was one who dreamed of a sudden death</l>
      <l n="105">As she blew out her light .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="19">
      <l n="106">And there was one who turned from clamoring streets ,</l>
      <l n="107">And walked in lamplit gardens among black trees ,</l>
      <l n="108">And looked at the windy sky ,</l>
      <l n="109">And thought with terror how stones and roots would freeze</l>
      <l n="110">And birds in the dead boughs cry . . .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="20">
      <l n="111">And she hurried back , as snow fell , mixed with rain ,</l>
      <l n="112">To mingle among the crowds again ,</l>
      <l n="113">To jostle beneath blue lamps along the street ;</l>
      <l n="114">And lost herself in the warm bright coiling dream ,</l>
      <l n="115">With a sound of murmuring voices and shuffling feet .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="21">
      <l n="116">And one , from his high bright window looking down</l>
      <l n="117">On luminous chasms that cleft the basalt town ,</l>
      <l n="118">Hearing a sea-like murmur rise ,</l>
      <l n="119">Desired to leave his dream , descend from the tower ,</l>
      <l n="120">And drown in waves of shouts and laughter and cries .</l>

      <l n="121">The snow floats down upon us , mingled with rain . . .</l>
      <l n="122">It eddies around pale lilac lamps , and falls</l>
      <l n="123">Down golden-windowed walls .</l>
      <l n="124">We were all born of flesh , in a flare of pain ,</l>
      <l n="125">We do not remember the red roots whence we rose ,</l>
      <l n="126">But we know that we rose and walked , that after a while</l>
      <l n="127">We shall lie down again .</l>

      <l n="128">The snow floats down upon us , we turn , we turn ,</l>
      <l n="129">Through gorges filled with light we sound and flow . . .</l>
      <l n="130">One is struck down and hurt , we crowd about him ,</l>
      <l n="131">We bear him away , gaze after his listless body ;</l>
      <l n="132">But whether he lives or dies we do not know .</l>

     <lg type="stanza" n="24">
      <l n="133">One of us sings in the street , and we listen to him ;</l>

      <l n="136">It is strange ; this house of dust was the house I lived in ;</l>
      <l n="137">The house you lived in , the house that all of us know .</l>
      <l n="138">And coiling slowly about him , and laughing at him ,</l>
      <l n="139">And throwing him pennies , we bear away</l>
      <l n="140">A mournful echo of other times and places ,</l>
      <l n="141">And follow a dream . . . a dream that will not stay .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="25">
      <l n="142">Down long broad flights of lamplit stairs we flow ;</l>
      <l n="143">Noisy , in scattered waves , crowding and shouting ;</l>
      <l n="144">In broken slow cascades .</l>
      <l n="145">The gardens extend before us . . . We spread out swiftly ;</l>

     <lg type="stanza" n="26">
      <l n="147">And we recall , with a gleaming stab of sadness ,</l>
      <l n="148">Vaguely and incoherently , some dream</l>
      <l n="149">Of a world we came from , a world of sun-blue hills . . .</l>
      <l n="150">A black wood whispers around us , green eyes gleam ;</l>
      <l n="151">Someone cries in the forest , and someone kills .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="27">
      <l n="152">We flow to the east , to the white-lined shivering sea ;</l>
      <l n="153">We reach to the west , where the whirling sun went down ;</l>
      <l n="154">We close our eyes to music in bright cafees .</l>
      <l n="155">We diverge from clamorous streets to streets that are silent .</l>

     <lg type="stanza" n="28">
      <l n="157">And , growing tired , we turn aside at last ,</l>

     <lg type="stanza" n="101">
      <l n="729">Well ,— it was two days after my husband died —</l>
      <l n="730">Two days ! And the earth still raw above him .</l>
      <l n="731">And I was sweeping the carpet in their hall .</l>
      <l n="732">In number four — the room with the red wall-paper —</l>
      <l n="733">Some chorus girls and men were singing that song</l>
      <l n="734">‘ They 'll soon be lighting candles</l>
      <l n="735">Round a box with silver handles ’ — and hearing them sing it</l>
      <l n="736">I started to cry . Just then he came along</l>
      <l n="737">And stopped on the stairs and turned and looked at me ,</l>
      <l n="738">And took the cigar from his mouth and sort of smiled</l>
      <l n="739">And said , ‘ Say , what 's the matter ? ’ and then came down</l>
      <l n="740">Where I was leaning against the wall ,</l>
      <l n="741">And touched my shoulder , and put his arm around me . . .</l>
      <l n="742">And I was so sad , thinking about it ,—</l>
      <l n="743">Thinking that it was raining , and a cold night ,</l>
      <l n="744">With Jim so unaccustomed to being dead ,—</l>
      <l n="745">That I was happy to have him sympathize ,</l>
      <l n="746">To feel his arm , and leaned against him and cried .</l>
      <l n="747">And before I knew it , he got me into a room</l>
      <l n="748">Where a table was set , and no one there ,</l>
      <l n="749">And sat me down on a sofa , and held me close ,</l>
      <l n="750">And talked to me , telling me not to cry ,</l>
      <l n="751">That it was all right , he 'd look after me ,—</l>
      <l n="752">But not to cry , my eyes were getting red ,</l>
      <l n="753">Which did n't make me pretty . And he was so nice ,</l>
      <l n="754">That when he turned my face between his hands ,</l>
      <l n="755">And looked at me , with those blue eyes of his ,</l>
      <l n="756">And smiled , and leaned , and kissed me —</l>
      <l n="757">Somehow I could n't tell him not to do it ,</l>
      <l n="758">Somehow I did n't mind , I let him kiss me ,</l>
      <l n="759">And closed my eyes ! . . . Well , that was how it started .</l>
      <l n="760">For when my heart was eased with crying , and grief</l>
      <l n="761">Had passed and left me quiet , somehow it seemed</l>
      <l n="762">As if it was n't honest to change my mind ,</l>
      <l n="763">To send him away , or say I had n't meant it —</l>
      <l n="764">And , anyway , it seemed so hard to explain !</l>
      <l n="765">And so we sat and talked , not talking much ,</l>
      <l n="766">But meaning as much in silence as in words ,</l>
      <l n="767">There in that empty room with palms about us ,</l>
      <l n="768">That private dining-room . . . And as we sat there</l>
      <l n="769">I felt my future changing , day by day ,</l>
      <l n="770">With unknown streets opening left and right ,</l>
      <l n="771">New streets with farther lights , new taller houses ,</l>
      <l n="772">Doors swinging into hallways filled with light ,</l>
      <l n="773">Half-opened luminous windows , with white curtains</l>
      <l n="774">Streaming out in the night , and sudden music ,—</l>
      <l n="775">And thinking of this , and through it half remembering</l>
      <l n="776">A quick and horrible death , my husband 's eyes ,</l>
      <l n="777">The broken-plastered walls , my boy asleep ,—</l>
      <l n="778">It seemed as if my brain would break in two .</l>
      <l n="779">My voice began to tremble . . . and when I stood ,</l>
      <l n="780">And told him I must go , and said good-night —</l>
      <l n="781">I could n't see the end . How would it end ?</l>
      <l n="782">Would he return to-morrow ? Or would he not ?</l>
      <l n="783">And did I want him to — or would I rather</l>
      <l n="784">Look for another job ?— He took my shoulders</l>
      <l n="785">Between his hands , and looked down into my eyes ,</l>
      <l n="786">And smiled , and said good-night . If he had kissed me ,</l>
      <l n="787">That would have — well , I do n't know ; but he did n't . .</l>
      <l n="788">And so I went downstairs , then , half elated ,</l>
      <l n="789">Hoping to close the door before that party</l>
      <l n="790">In number four should sing that song again —</l>
      <l n="791">‘ They 'll soon be lighting candles round a box with silver handles ’ —</l>
      <l n="792">And sure enough , I did . I faced the darkness .</l>
      <l n="793">And my eyes were filled with tears . And I was happy .</l>

      <l n="1460">As evening falls ,</l>
      <l n="1461">The walls grow luminous and warm , the walls</l>
      <l n="1462">Tremble and glow with the lives within them moving ,</l>
      <l n="1463">Moving like music , secret and rich and warm .</l>
      <l n="1464">How shall we live to-night , where shall we turn ?</l>
      <l n="1465">To what new light or darkness yearn ?</l>
      <l n="1466">A thousand winding stairs lead down before us ;</l>
      <l n="1467">And one by one in myriads we descend</l>
      <l n="1468">By lamplit flowered walls , long balustrades ,</l>
      <l n="1469">Through half-lit halls which reach no end . . . .</l>

      <l n="1472">Look how the organist 's head , in silhouette ,</l>
      <l n="1473">Leans to the lamplit music 's orange square ! . . .</l>
      <l n="1474">The dim-globed lamps illumine rows of faces ,</l>
      <l n="1475">Rows of hands and arms and hungry eyes ,</l>
      <l n="1476">They have hurried down from a myriad secret places ,</l>
      <l n="1477">From windy chambers next to the skies . . . .</l>
      <l n="1478">The music comes upon us . . . . it shakes the darkness ,</l>
      <l n="1479">It shakes the darkness in our minds . . . .</l>
      <l n="1480">And brilliant figures suddenly fill the darkness ,</l>
      <l n="1481">Down the white shaft of light they run through darkness ,</l>
      <l n="1482">And in our hearts a dazzling dream unwinds . . .</l>

      <l n="1484">By the slow soundless crashings of a sea</l>
      <l n="1485">Down miles on miles of glistening mirrorlike sand ,—</l>
      <l n="1486">Take my hand</l>
      <l n="1487">And walk with me once more by crumbling walls ;</l>
      <l n="1488">Up mouldering stairs where grey-stemmed ivy clings ,</l>
      <l n="1489">To hear forgotten bells , as evening falls ,</l>
      <l n="1490">Rippling above us invisibly their slowly widening rings . . . .</l>
      <l n="1491">Did you once love me ? Did you bear a name ?</l>
      <l n="1492">Did you once stand before me without shame ? . . .</l>
      <l n="1493">Take my hand : your face is one I know ,</l>
      <l n="1494">I loved you , long ago :</l>
      <l n="1495">You are like music , long forgotten , suddenly come to mind ;</l>
      <l n="1496">You are like spring returned through snow .</l>
      <l n="1497">Once , I know , I walked with you in starlight ,</l>
      <l n="1498">And many nights I slept and dreamed of you ;</l>
      <l n="1499">Come , let us climb once more these stairs of starlight ,</l>
      <l n="1500">This midnight stream of cloud-flung blue ! . . .</l>
      <l n="1501">Music murmurs beneath us like a sea ,</l>
      <l n="1502">And faints to a ghostly whisper . . . Come with me .</l>

      <l n="1505">What you would gladly , if you could , forget ?</l>
      <l n="1506">You were unfaithful once , you met your lover ;</l>
      <l n="1507">Still in your heart you bear that red-eyed ember ;</l>
      <l n="1508">And I was silent ,— you remember my silence yet . . .</l>
      <l n="1509">You knew , as well as I , I could not kill him ,</l>
      <l n="1510">Nor touch him with hot hands , nor yet with hate .</l>
      <l n="1511">No , and it was not you I saw with anger .</l>
      <l n="1512">Instead , I rose and beat at steel-walled fate ,</l>
      <l n="1513">Cried till I lay exhausted , sick , unfriended ,</l>
      <l n="1514">That life , so seeming sure , and love , so certain ,</l>
      <l n="1515">Should loose such tricks , be so abruptly ended ,</l>

      <l n="1519">No , you were pitiful , and I gave you pity ;</l>
      <l n="1520">And only hated you when I saw you cry .</l>
      <l n="1521">We were two dupes ; if I could give forgiveness ,—</l>
      <l n="1522">Had I the right ,— I should forgive you now . . .</l>
      <l n="1523">We were two dupes . . . Come , let us walk in starlight ,</l>
      <l n="1524">And feed our griefs : we do not break , but bow .</l>

      <l n="1528">To spread their mottled shimmer along the sand ! . . .</l>
      <l n="1529">Take my hand ,</l>

      <l n="1531">Nor how , when you are dead ,</l>
      <l n="1532">Green leagues of sea will glimmer above your head .</l>
      <l n="1533">You lean your face upon your hands and cry ,</l>

      <l n="1535">Terrible seems it now to die ,—</l>
      <l n="1536">Terrible now , with life so incomplete ,</l>
      <l n="1537">To turn away from the balconies and the music ,</l>
      <l n="1538">The sunlit afternoons ,</l>
      <l n="1539">To hear behind you there a far-off laughter</l>
      <l n="1540">Lost in a stirring of sand among dry dunes . . .</l>
      <l n="1541">Die not sadly , you whom life has beaten !</l>
      <l n="1542">Lift your face up , laughing , die like a queen !</l>
      <l n="1543">Take cold flowers of foam in your warm white fingers !</l>
      <l n="1544">Death 's but a change of sky from blue to green . . .</l>
