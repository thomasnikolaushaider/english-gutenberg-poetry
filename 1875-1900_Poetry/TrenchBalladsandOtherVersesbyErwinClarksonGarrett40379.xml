   <div type="dedication">
    <p>THIS BOOK IS DEDICATED TO THE MEMORY OF MY FATHER , the late Captain George L. Garrett , of the Union Army , during the Civil War AND TO MY MOTHER , whose lifelong devotion , unselfishness , tenderness and loyalty to me , as to all her family and friends , make this dedication a pleasure and a joy only commensurate with my thought of her .</p>

    <head>PREFACE</head>
   </div>
   <titlePage>
    <docImprint>I have divided this book into three distinct parts . Part I , Trench Ballads , consists of forty American soldier poems of<country>America</country>'s participation in the World War ,<date>1917-19</date>, based entirely on actual facts and incidents , and almost exclusively on my own personal experiences and observations , when a private in Company G , 16th Infantry , First Division , of the American Expeditionary Forces in<country>France</country>. Part II , Pre-war Poems , consists of three sets of verses written just before the active entry of<country>America</country>in the war , and appertaining to , but not an integral part of , it , and therefore grouped separately . Part III , Other Poems , contains those of a general and non-military character . It is highly desirable the “ Notes ” at the end of this volume should be consulted , and that it be realized that with few exceptions , all these Trench Ballads were written in<country>France</country>, many scribbled on odd pieces of paper or on old envelopes in the trenches themselves , and consequently , when present locality is intimated , it is always<country>France</country>, that is to say , from the standpoint that I am speaking in and from the seat of operations . For example , when I use the term “ over here , ” it really means what the people at home in<country>America</country>would call “ over there . ” Hyperbole or little characteristic anecdotes that really never occurred , except in the brain of an author , I have absolutely shunned , and have endeavored to adhere strictly to “ the truth , the whole truth and nothing but the truth , ” and to set forth the vicissitudes ; the dangers , joys and tribulations of the army man , and especially the man in the ranks , and more especially the man in the ranks of the Infantry , as these latter formed the actual front-line or combat troops that bore the brunt in this greatest of all wars . Absolute continuity or sequence would seem superfluous , but it will be observed that I have endeavored to maintain it to a certain extent , i. e ., by gradually leading from a number of military verses , without any strict inter-relation , to the day of being wounded , then on to several poems concerning the military hospital , and finally bringing the Trench Ballads to a close with those having to do with the returning home of the soldier . My previous book , “ Army Ballads and Other Verses , ” is the result of my experiences when serving as a private in Companies “ L ” and “ G , ” 23rd Infantry and Troop “ I , ” 5th Cavalry ( Regulars ) , during the Philippine Insurrection of<date>1899-1902</date>, and if “ Army Ballads and Other Verses ” is taken in conjunction with this volume , it is my hope together they may prove a fairly comprehensive anthology of the American soldier of recent times .

    <p n="1">NOTES .</p>
    <p n="2">* Trenches *</p>
    <p n="3">French Lorraine Lorraine is now French , but , of course , it was not so during the war .</p>
    <p n="4">Kultur The so-called German culture .</p>
    <p n="5">* Barb-Wire Posts *</p>
    <p n="6">Herein is described a common optical illusion or phenomenon seen by all soldiers , old and young , experienced or green , during the long night vigils looking through the wires , across No Man 's Land .</p>
    <p n="7">Boche A German .</p>
    <p n="8">Hun A German . The people of Germany take great exception to being called “ Huns , ” protesting that they are not of this stock . After the defeat of Attila and his Huns at Chalons , in 451 A. D ., by the combined efforts of the Celts themselves , the indigenous people of France , the Romans , who were still masters of the country , the Franks , who had already become a power in the land , having advanced as far south as the Somme , and the Visigoths , who , early in the same century , had established their great empire in southern France and Spain ; after this great battle the Huns retreated back into Germany , where many of their descendants must still be , but of course the majority of the German people are not , from an ethnological standpoint , Huns . The reason for this appelation being applied to them is simply that when a people have the attributes of a Hun , they must expect to be so designated . A man may very properly be called a pig without any misapprehension that he actually travels upon four hoofs . However , it is possible , though not probable , that the leopard may change his spots ; and time , and contact with civilization , and a democratic form of government may eventually eradicate the present very marked idiosyncrasies of the German race .</p>
    <p n="9">* Your Gas-Mask *</p>
    <p n="10">“ full-field ” The full-field pack , consisting of blankets , shelter-half , clothing , extra shoes , etc ., weighing over 50 pounds , on the back of an infantryman , and guaranteed to increase 50 pounds in weight every five kilometers after the first ten kilometer mark has been passed .</p>
    <p n="11">full marching-order The full-field pack as described above , plus rifle , cartridge-belt with a hundred rounds of ammunition , two bandoliers , each containing a hundred extra rounds , gas-mask , mess outfit and the steel helmet , commonly known as your tin hat .</p>

C ., Egypt 's greatest conqueror , and under whom the Egyptian Empire attained its largest extent . Rameses II ( the Great ) of the following Dynasty , is , however , the more generally known .</p>
    <p n="17">Cyrus ’ doughboys swept etc . Refers to the passage of Cyrus and his great army through the Cilician Gates , on his way from his conquest of Lydia in Asia Minor , to his descent of the Euphrates Valley to Babylon , whose easy capitulation in 539 B. C. finally brought to an end the old glory of the Babylonian Empire , which , after a long period under Assyrian rule , had blossomed forth in a glorious recrudescence , in the latter part of the Seventh Century B . C , under Nebopolassar and his famous son Nebuchadnezzar — and then known as the Neo-Babylonian Empire , or , more commonly , as Chaldea . The reader will doubtless remember that it was through the same passage in the Taurus Mountains that Ashurbanapal , le Grand Monarque of Assyria when at the apogee of her power in the Seventh Century B . C , and also Alexander the Great , sweeping to his eastern conquests , both passed .</p>
    <p n="18">Doughboys is the popular present-day nickname for infantrymen .</p>

    <p n="38">Mademoiselle The army man pronounces the word “ mademoiselle ” at full length , using the most punctilious care to enunciate each and every one of the four syllables . Whether this is due to the word being foreign to many of them , or whether it is due to their all-saving subtle sense of American humor , so that it seems rather delicious to call the little French ladies by so long and ponderous a title , I really do not know , but I strongly suspect that it is the latter .</p>
    <p n="39">The First Division Caesar had his Tenth Legion , Napoleon had his Old Guard , and the American Army during the World War had its First Division . It might therefore not seem entirely malapropos to quote the words of the great French general Mangin , who was the corps commander of the First Division of the American Army , the famous First Moroccans of the French Army and the Second Division of the American Army , at the Second Battle of the Marne , that began on July 18th , 1918 , and was the turning point of the whole war . In this great door movement the First Division was given practically the post of honor at the hinge itself , i. e ., directly at Soissons , only one division , the 153rd French Infantry Division , being on the inside of the First Division , and as it was in this engagement that a gentleman of Teutonic origin , operating a machine-gun from our extreme left flank , and apparently very much irritated about something , put a bullet in my side and out my back , it is only natural that the message of Gen. Mangin was of interest to me , and saved , and here quoted verbatim :—</p>
    <p n="40">Lauds Americans in Battle . General Mangin Thanks Pershing 's Men for Brilliant Part in Drive . ( By Associated Press . )</p>
    <p n="41">With the French . Army in France , Aug . 7 .— General Mangin , who was in direct command of the Allied forces in the drive against the German right flank south of Soissons , has issued the following order of the day thanking the American troops for their brilliant participation in the battle which caused the German retreat between the Marne and the Aisne :</p>
    <p n="42">“ Officers , non-commissioned officers and soldiers of the Third American Army Corps :</p>
    <p n="43">“ Shoulder to shoulder with your French comrades , you threw yourselves into the counter-offensive begun on July 18th . You ran to it like going to a feast . Your magnificent dash upset and surprised the enemy and your indomitable tenacity stopped counter-attacks by his fresh divisions . You have shown yourselves to be worthy sons of your great country and have gained the admiration of your brothers in arms .</p>
    <p n="44">“ Ninety-one cannon , 7 , 200 prisoners , immense booty and ten kilometers ( six and a quarter miles ) of reconquered territory are your share of the trophies of this victory . Besides this , you have acquired a feeling of your superiority over the barbarian enemy against whom the children of liberty are fighting . To attack him is to vanquish him .</p>
    <p n="45">“ American comrades , I am grateful to you for the blood you generously spilled on the soil of my country . I am proud of having commanded you during such splendid days , and to have fought with you for the deliverance of the world . ”</p>
    <p n="46">“ The Stars and Stripes , ” the weekly paper of the A. E. F. in France , in giving a tabulated form of the record of the various divisions , and their insignia , which was worn on the shoulder of the left sleeve , said the following of the First Division :—</p>
    <p n="47">Division Insignia : Crimson figure “ 1 ” on khaki background , chosen because the numeral “ 1 ” represents the number of the division and many of its subsidiary organizations . Also , as proudly claimed , because it was the “ First Division in France ; first in sector ; first to fire a shot at the Germans ; first to attack ; first to conduct a raid ; first to be raided ; first to capture prisoners ; first to inflict casualties ; first to suffer casualties ; first to be cited singly in General Orders ; first in the number of Division , Corps and Army Commanders and General Staff Officers produced from its personnel . ”</p>
    <p n="48">To this might have been added that the First Division , which was a Regular Army division , and originally comprised about twenty or thirty per cent “ old soldiers , ” and the rest of us “ war volunteers , ” but proud of being “ Regulars , ” the First Division , which consisted of the 16th , 18th , 26th and 28th Infantry Regiments , the 5th , 6th and 7th Field Artillery Regiments , the 1st Engineer Regiment , and a complement of Cavalry , etc ., was the division that General Pershing , the commander-in-chief , picked out to fill the most vital positions on important occasions , as , for example , when , from the whole army , he chose the First Division to go into the front line just west of Montdidier , at the Battle of Picardy , to help hold the very apex of the huge German bulge that had swept southwestward from St. Quentin to Montdidier , in the great series of Hun drives which started on March 21st . 1918 . Again , it was the First Division that Pershing placed at Soissons at virtually the hinge of the great door movement in the turning point of the whole war , the Second Battle of the Marne , as heretofore described ; and it was the First Division to which Pershing again gave the post of honor when the St. Mihiel salient was closed , as it was this Division that was placed on the inside position of the great southern jaw , just east of Xivray and dangerous Mont Sec .</p>
    <p n="49">Casualties and kilometers make very interesting reading , but when a Commander-in-chief consistently and persistently picks out one certain division for the most difficult and all-important positions , there is not much room for argumentation .</p>
    <p n="50">Mr . Page , in his article in The World 's Work , for May . 1919. in describing the Second Battle of the Marne , tells how the First Division went over the top with the 153rd French Infantry Division on its left , and the famous First Moroccan Division and the Second Division of the American Army on its right , and how , in this gruelling engagement , the First Division outlasted both the Second Division and the First Moroccans , and really also the 153rd French Division on its left , as this latter was obliged to get reinforcements , Mr . Page recapitulating the situation with the following paragraph :—</p>
    <p n="51">“ When the division ( the First Division ) finally came out of the line it had lost more than 7 , 200 men , mostly in the infantry . The full complement of infantry in a division is 12. 000 . Five days ’ constant and successful attack after a long march : an advance of more than six and a quarter miles ( ten kilometers ) ; losses of at least 50 per cent , of the infantry engaged : keeping pace with the famous Moroccan Division and staving longer in the fight — all this had demonstrated that the 1st Division could stand in any company . ” In mentioning these facts there is no desire on my part to pretend that this outfit single-handed won the war , because , if I said that , I would be talking sheer nonsense . The consensus of opinion both at home and abroad , seems to be that the whole American Army lived entirely up to expectations , so that any man who was in a combat division , has good reason to feel proud of his own division , irrespective of what one that may have been . With this little word of explanation I feel at liberty to quote the following which appeared in the Paris edition of The New York Herald :—</p>
    <p n="52">Prowess of Yanks Compels Praise Even from Hun , ( Special telegram to the Herald . ) From Burr Price . With the American Armies . Friday</p>
    <p n="53">From a captured officer of the German army comes a remarkable tribute to the fighting prowess of the First Division of the American troops , whose work will go down in history as among the most remarkable of the present war .</p>
    <p n="54">He declared the Germans did not believe the Americans could produce , within five years , a division such as they had found the First Division to be . The German , when taken , had seen four years of severe fighting . This is what he had to say yesterday :—</p>
    <p n="55">“ I received orders to hold the ground at all costs . The American barrage advanced toward my position and the work of your artillery was marvelous . The barrage was so dense that it was impossible for us to move out of our dugouts .</p>
    <p n="56">“ Following the barrage closely were the troops of the First Division . I saw them forge ahead and knew that all was lost . All night I remained in my dugout , hoping vainly that something would happen that would permit me to rejoin my army . This morning your troops found me and here I am , after four years of fighting , a prisoner .</p>
    <p n="57">“ Yesterday , I knew that the First Division was opposite us , and I knew we would have to put up the hardest fight of the war . The First Division is wonderful and the German army knows it .</p>
    <p n="58">“ We did not believe that within five years the Americans could develop a division such as this First Division . The work of its infantry and artillery is worthy of the best armies of the world . ”</p>
    <p n="59">Little Gold Chevrons on My Cuffs The gold chevrons , called “ stripes , ” worn on the cuffs of “ overseas ” soldiers , during the World War , each one on the left cuff standing for six months ’ “ overseas ” service , and each chevron on the right cuff standing for a wound . One wound chevron meant a wound or wounds severe enough to take a man back to the hospital , irrespective of whether he had one or a dozen bullets or pieces of shell in him on that occasion .</p>
    <p n="60">Captain Blankburg The patrol herein described was what was called a “ reconnoitering patrol , ” sent out solely for the purpose of gathering information , keeping itself unknown to the enemy , and not fighting unless actually attacked . “ Combat patrols ” were sent out for this latter purpose .</p>
    <p n="61">* Interrupted Chow *</p>
    <p n="62">Buzzy-cart The carts that were sent from the company kitchens , which were usually from six to ten kilometers back of the first line trenches , up to within about two to four kilometers of the front line , where they would stop at designated points until chow details from the second line came back to them , to carry the cans of slum , coffee , and the bread or hardtack , up to the men in the first and second line . All this , of course , was done under cover of darkness , but as the Germans had the range of all the roads , etc ., and knew at about what time the food had to be gone after , it meant that almost every night at least one detail was shot to pieces .</p>
    <p n="63">Dog-tag Small , round metal disc , suspended from the neck by a cord , and with the soldier 's name , rank and organization stamped thereon , and forming an identification tag .</p>
    <p n="64">* The Gas-Proof Mule *</p>
    <p n="65">“ Stand-to ” In the first and second line trenches everyone was obliged to remain awake all night , but at dawn each man had to take his exact post , and be prepared to repel any enemy attack that might come over , as that was a favorite hour for doing so . This was called “ stand-to . ”</p>

    <p n="71">Sitting Jake Means the same thing as “ Sitting on the World , ” i. e ., everything salubrious and “ breaking ” just right .</p>
    <p n="72">Note</p>
    <p n="73">While realizing that my personal affairs are of no possible interest to the reader , it would seem , however , almost obligatory for me to do myself justice , and explain that I was quite willing to shoulder responsibility , which this poem might make it appear I was not . Hence the following little anecdote :— During a rest period back from the trenches , which was the only occasion when you had time to bother your head about smaller things , several men had applied for officers ’ commissions , so I got some civilian letters of recommendation , and put in an application to be permitted to go up for examination for a commission . This application was forwarded “ approved ” by my company commander , together with personal recommendations from my three previous company commanders . As this officer is the one who sees you daily , his recommendation is , from a military standpoint , of more value than that of a major-general . But in spite of my application being forwarded with the approval of all four of the company commanders that I had had up to that time , it was disapproved higher up by someone who very seldom could ever have even seen me . But having had no thought or intention of getting a commission , when I entered the Army , and having crossed over to Europe as a civilian , at my own expense , in August , 1917 , to enlist in the American Army in France , which I did on September 1st , 1917 , in Paris , so as to absolutely insure getting into the trenches , and as at the time of my application I had already accomplished my purpose , it may readily be discerned that the return of my application did not perturb the habitual equanimity of my soul , nor cause me to lose any of my natural sleep or youthful charm .</p>
    <p n="74">* Only for You *</p>
    <p n="75">rowdy or cad While very often some junior , or even senior , officer would fall under this category , and even worse , the majority of them really tried to give their men a square deal . If an officer were a rough-neck , snob , or as the men in the ranks would usually express it , a ribbon-counter clerk , it was only quite natural that he would take cowardly advantage of his shoulder straps to make it as miserable as possible for the men under him , but if an officer were a gentleman in civilian life , the man in the ranks was sure to be handled as a man and treated fairly , so long as he did his military duty and conducted himself as a soldier . Of this latter type , I can look back with pleasure on all my company commanders , remembering especially men like Lt. Victor Parks , Jr ., and Capt . Allen F. Kingman , “ officers and gentlemen ” in the highest sense of the word . Upon the one or two officers of the other type it is quite unnecessary to dwell . When once free from contact with a skunk , one simply bathes , changes one 's clothes , and promptly allows the odoriferous memory to be wafted away and disseminated in the ambient atmosphere of oblivion .</p>
    <p n="76">Silver bursts cut Artillery flares at night show red , but in the early dawn they appear against the dark hillsides like bursts of silver .</p>
    <p n="77">* Old Fusee *</p>
    <p n="78">Fusee Soldier term for his rifle , the French word “ fusil ” meaning that weapon .</p>
    <p n="79">The Colors of Blighty Because of its brevity , succinctness and expressiveness , I have used the word Blighty to designate a military hospital , though it was never in really popular use by the American soldier for this purpose , and to the British soldier it simply meant going back to England , but as so often Tommy Atkins went back to his Tight Little Island because he was wounded , Blighty frequently meant “ hospital . ”</p>
