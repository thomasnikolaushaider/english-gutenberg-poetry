    <docTitle><titlePart>35 Sonnets by Fernando Pessoa Edition 1 , ( November 30 , 2006 ) I . Whether we write or speak or do but look We are ever unapparent . What we are Cannot be transfused into word or book . Our soul from us is infinitely far . However much we give our thoughts the will To be our soul and gesture it abroad , Our hearts are incommunicable still . In what we show ourselves we are ignored . The abyss from soul to soul cannot be bridged By any skill of thought or trick of seeming . Unto our very selves we are abridged When we would utter to our thought our being . We are our dreams of ourselves , souls by gleams , And each to each other dreams of others ’ dreams . II . If that apparent part of life ’ s delight Our tingled flesh-sense circumscribes were seen By aught save reflex and co-carnal sight , Joy , flesh and life might prove but a gross screen . Haply Truth ’ s body is no eyable being , Appearance even as appearance lies , Haply our close , dark , vague , warm sense of seeing Is the choked vision of blindfolded eyes . Wherefrom what comes to thought ’ s sense of life ? Nought . All is either the irrational world we see Or some aught-else whose being-unknown doth rot Its use for our thought ’ s use . Whence taketh me A qualm-like ache of life , a body-deep Soul-hate of what we seek and what we weep .</titlePart></docTitle>

     <l n="4">In this inked page than in my direct soul ;</l>

     <l n="6">Good readers of me in some aftertime ,</l>
     <l n="7">Thankful to some idea of my being</l>
     <l n="8">That doth not even my with gone true soul rime ;</l>
     <l n="9">An anger at the essence of the world ,</l>
     <l n="10">That makes this thus , or thinkable this wise ,</l>
     <l n="11">Takes my soul by the throat and makes it hurled</l>
     <l n="12">In nightly horrors of despaired surmise ,</l>
     <l n="13">And I become the mere sense of a rage</l>

      <l n="22">To know thee ever at that deathlessness .</l>
      <l n="23">But when I came where thou wert laid , and saw</l>
      <l n="24">The natural flowers ignoring thee sans blame ,</l>
      <l n="25">And the encroaching grass , with casual flaw ,</l>
      <l n="26">Framing the stone to age where was thy name ,</l>

      <l n="32">My soul appalled at the world ’ s work ’ s time-greed ?</l>
      <l n="33">How can I pause my thoughts upon the task</l>
      <l n="34">My soul was born to think that it must do</l>
      <l n="35">When every moment has a thought to ask</l>

      <l n="37">The coin I ’ d heap for marrying my Muse</l>
      <l n="38">And build our home i ’ th ’ greater Time-to-be</l>

      <l n="49">With useless care labours but to be spurned ,</l>
      <l n="50">Courting in alien speech the Muse ’ s pleasure ;</l>
      <l n="51">I study how to love or how to hate ,</l>
      <l n="52">Estranged by consciousness from sentiment ,</l>
      <l n="53">With a thought feeling forced to be sedate</l>
      <l n="54">Even when the feeling ’ s nature is violent ;</l>

      <l n="66">A garment of its thought untorn or covering ,</l>
      <l n="67">Or with its stuffed garb forge an otherworld</l>
      <l n="68">Without itself its dead deceit discovering ;</l>
