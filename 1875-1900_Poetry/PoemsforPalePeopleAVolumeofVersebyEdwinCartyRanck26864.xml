    <head>PREFACE</head>
    <p n="1">This little volume was written for no reason on earth and with no earthly reason . It just simply happened , on the principle , I suppose that “ murder will out . ” Murder is a bad thing and so are nonsense rhymes . There is often a valid excuse for murder ; there is none for nonsense rhymes . They seem to be a necessary evil to be classed with smallpox , chicken-pox , yellow fever and other irruptive diseases . They are also on the order of the boomerang and eventually rebound and inflict much suffering on the unlucky verse-slinger . So you see nonsense , like a little learning is a dangerous thing and should be handled with as much care as the shotgun which is never known to be loaded .</p>
    <p n="2">A man who writes nonsense may become in time a big gun . But this is rare ; more often he becomes a small bore . This appears paradoxical and will probably require thinking over , but the more you think it over the less you will understand . This is true of parlor magic . It is also true of the magazine poets . It really never pays to think . Thinking is too much like work . After reading these rhymes you will not think that the writer ever did think , which after all is the right way to think .</p>
    <p n="3">When Dryden wrote “ Alexander 's Feast ” he modestly stated that it was the grandest poem ever written . Mr. Dryden evidently believed this or he would n't have said so . But then every one did not agree with Mr. Dryden . Now I am going one step further and will positively state that the writer of this volume is the greatest poetical genius who has not yet died in infancy .</p>
    <p n="4">This is an astounding statement but it can be corroborated by admiring friends , for the writer is like a certain brand of children 's food in that he is advertised by his loving friends .</p>
    <p n="5">Speaking of “ Alexander 's Feast ” it simply cannot be compared to any one of the finished , poetic gems in this collection because it is so utterly different . The difference is what made Dryden famous . But comparisons are odious , and Mr. Dryden has been dead several years .</p>
    <p n="6">“ But what , ” you may ask , “ is the object of nonsense verse ? ” Most assuredly to make one laugh . That masterpiece of nonsense “ Alice In Wonderland ” and its companion volume “ Through The Looking Class ” are absurd books , but their very absurdity is what appeals to us most . Their author , Mr. Lewis Carroll was , in private life a very sober gentleman ( at least we hope so ) . Nonsense is the salt of life with which we season the dry food of everyday cooking .</p>
    <p n="7">“ A little nonsense now and then Is relished by the wisest men . ”</p>
    <p n="8">Even serious old Longfellow had this feeling in his bones when he wrote the immortal lines which all of us recall from childhood :</p>
    <p n="9">“ There was a little girl And she had a little curl Which hung way down on her forehead ; And when she was good , She was very good indeed , But when she was bad , she was horrid . ”</p>
    <p n="10">This is nonsense pure and simple and even the most ardent admirers of Mr. Longfellow must , when they try to make “ forehead ” and “ horrid ” rhyme , admit that it was very poor verse for the author of “ Evangeline . ”</p>
    <p n="11">Bret Harte flew off at a tangent when he wrote about “ Ah Sin , The Chinaman , ” a nonsense poem that gave “ Bill Nye ” his pseudonym . Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote “ The Wonderful One-Hoss Shay . ” Rudyard Kipling is often “ caught with the goods on him ” and Mark Twain wrote an “ Ode to Stephen Dowling Botts . ”</p>
    <p n="12">And Great Scott ! I almost forgot that even such a gentle , domestic creature as the cow has been the unconscious inspiration of much nonsense and has doubtless often chewed the bitter cud of reflection in deploring her undesired popularity . First she was forced ( very much against her will , no doubt ) to jump over the moon to the undignified strains of “ Hey Diddle , Diddle . ” Then , just when beginning to breathe easily again after that astounding performance , Gelett Burgess came along and gave her more notoriety by raising the question as to whether there was such a thing as a “ purple cow . ” And even today in many of the rural districts there are old farmers who never heard of Burgess and his “ purple cow ” who will tell you solemnly that “ there is a cow of a sort of purplish color . ” Which goes to prove that after all nonsense is only sense plus — NON .</p>

    <head>WHY THE MOLE IS BLIND .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">In days gone by , when cows could fly</l>
     <l n="2">And goblins rode on bears ;</l>
     <l n="3">When fairies danced upon the green</l>
     <l n="4">And giants moped in lairs ,</l>
     <l n="5">There lived alone upon a shelf</l>
     <l n="6">A tinsie , winsie little elf .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="7">Just when the stars came out at night</l>
     <l n="8">And moonbeams filled the earth with light ,</l>
     <l n="9">Down from his perch this little elf</l>
     <l n="10">Would jump and wander by himself .</l>
     <l n="11">He wore a pair of little wings</l>
     <l n="12">Tied in their place by golden strings .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="13">One day he took a kind of notion</l>
     <l n="14">To take a trip upon the ocean .</l>
     <l n="15">He combed his hair and washed his face</l>
     <l n="16">And put his little wings in place ,</l>
     <l n="17">Then from his shelf he softly stole</l>
     <l n="18">And went to see his friend the mole</l>
     <l n="19">Who gave to him a pea-green boat</l>
     <l n="20">And guaranteed that it would float .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="21">A funny thing about this boat</l>
     <l n="22">‘ Twas patterned from a ten-pound note .</l>
     <l n="23">The little elf was greatly pleased</l>
     <l n="24">And laughed until he sneezed and sneezed ;</l>
     <l n="25">He launched his boat upon the sea</l>
     <l n="26">And kicked his little heels in glee .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="27">The mole looked on in glad surprise</l>
     <l n="28">( For in those days all moles had eyes . )</l>
     <l n="29">He shouted out a loud farewell</l>
     <l n="30">As the little row-boat rose and fell .</l>
     <l n="31">The elf picked up a golden oar</l>
     <l n="32">And soon lost sight of mole and shore .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="33">The elf rowed out for quite a way</l>
     <l n="34">And in the waves did sport and play ,</l>
     <l n="35">Until at length the sun sank low</l>
     <l n="36">And then he thought it time to go .</l>
     <l n="37">Now just as luck would have it then</l>
     <l n="38">A prowling sea gull left his den .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="39">The savage sea gull loudly laughed</l>
     <l n="40">To see an elf in such a craft ,</l>
     <l n="41">And swooping down upon the water</l>
     <l n="42">He did a thing he had n't oughter ,</l>
     <l n="43">For with his strong and sturdy beak</l>
     <l n="44">He caused the boat to spring a leak .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="45">He said he longed for a little change</l>
     <l n="46">And the bank-note boat was just in range ;</l>
     <l n="47">The poor young elf gave one big holler</l>
     <l n="48">Just as the sea gull made a swallow</l>
     <l n="49">( And this is strange indeed to follow</l>
     <l n="50">For a gull himself is just a swallow . )</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="51">The faithful mole heard this loud yell</l>
     <l n="52">And rushed down to the shore pell-mell .</l>
     <l n="53">Alas , alas he was too late</l>
     <l n="54">And saw his friend 's unhappy fate ;</l>
     <l n="55">He groaned , and shrieked and tore his fur</l>
     <l n="56">And raised an awful din and stir .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="57">The sea gull heard this awful racket</l>
     <l n="58">And seized the mole , just like a packet .</l>
     <l n="59">He carried him across the seas</l>
     <l n="60">To teach the young gulls A B C 's .</l>
     <l n="61">But the loving mole went blind with rage</l>
     <l n="62">And they had to put him in a cage ,</l>
     <l n="63">And ever since that fatal night</l>
     <l n="64">The moles have all been out of sight .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>NOW THERE 'S A COON IN THE MOON .</head>
     <l n="1">There was once an eccentric old coon ,</l>
     <l n="2">Who ate dynamite with a spoon ,</l>
     <l n="3">But when he got loaded</l>
     <l n="4">The powder exploded —</l>
     <l n="5">And now there 's a coon in the moon .</l>
   </lg>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>THE COUNTY FAIR .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Oh , let 's go out to the county fair</l>
     <l n="2">And breathe the balmy country air ,</l>
     <l n="3">And whittle a stick and look at the hosses ,</l>
     <l n="4">Discuss the farmer 's profit and losses .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">We 'll take a look at the country stock</l>
     <l n="6">And drink some milk from a dairy crock ;</l>
     <l n="7">Look at the pigs and admire the chickens ,</l>
     <l n="8">And try to forget it 's hot as the dickens .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">Forget there are any political rings</l>
     <l n="10">Just think of the butter and eggs and things ;</l>
     <l n="11">So wash off the buggy and hitch up the mare ,</l>
     <l n="12">And we 'll all go out to the county fair .</l>

   <lg type="poem">
    <head>O'DOWD OF THE JEFFERSON CLUB .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">A maddened horse comes down the street ,</l>
     <l n="2">With waving mane and flying feet .</l>
     <l n="3">The crowd scatters in every direction ;</l>
     <l n="4">It looks like a fight at a city election .</l>
     <l n="5">A big policeman waves his hands ,</l>
     <l n="6">And the air is full of vague commands ,</l>
     <l n="7">While across the street a retail grocer</l>
     <l n="8">Shrieks to his child as the horse draws closer</l>
     <l n="9">When suddenly out of the mad hubbub ,</l>
     <l n="10">Steps Jimmie O'Dowd of the Jefferson Club .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="11">Every man there holds his breath —</l>
     <l n="12">To stop the horse means sudden death .</l>
     <l n="13">But quick as a flash ,</l>
     <l n="14">O'Dowd makes a dash .</l>
     <l n="15">With all his might and the horse 's mane ,</l>
     <l n="16">He brings the old plug to a halt again .</l>
     <l n="17">Then every man there doffs his hat</l>
     <l n="18">And cries “ Well , what do you think of that ? ”</l>
     <l n="19">Never since the days of Nero</l>
     <l n="20">Has there been a greater hero .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>HALLOWEEN .</head>
     <l n="1">A night when witches skim the air ,</l>
     <l n="2">When spooks and goblins climb the stair ;</l>
     <l n="3">When bats rush out with muffled wings ,</l>
     <l n="4">And now and then the door-bell rings ;</l>
     <l n="5">But just the funniest thing of all</l>
     <l n="6">Is ‘ cause you can n't see when they call .</l>
   </lg>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>SATURDAY ON THE FARM .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">‘ Tis Saturday morn and all is bright</l>
     <l n="2">By nature 's own endowing ;</l>
     <l n="3">The sun is fiercely giving light ,</l>
     <l n="4">And only me —</l>
     <l n="5">Plowing .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="6">Across the river I hear the sound</l>
     <l n="7">Of a boatman slowly rowing ;</l>
     <l n="8">I have no time to fool around ,</l>
     <l n="9">Especially when I 'm —</l>
     <l n="10">Hoeing .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="11">And when the dinner hour has come ,</l>
     <l n="12">And thoughts of work are fleeting ,</l>
     <l n="13">I only hear the insects hum ,</l>
     <l n="14">Because I 'm busy —</l>
     <l n="15">Eating .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="16">At night when all things are at rest ,</l>
     <l n="17">Safe in Old Morpheus ’ keeping ,</l>
     <l n="18">No troubles do my mind infest ,</l>
     <l n="19">For I am soundly —</l>
     <l n="20">Sleeping .</l>

     <l n="1">O , the circus parade ! O , the circus parade !</l>
     <l n="2">It lays all the politics back in the shade ,</l>
     <l n="3">And the merchants forget that they 've got any trade ,</l>
     <l n="4">While many remember they 've never been paid</l>
     <l n="5">As they rushed out to look at the circus parade ;</l>
     <l n="6">And preachers who used to be terribly staid</l>
     <l n="7">Yell just like boys at the circus parade .</l>
     <l n="8">Every one 's there , both the mistress and maid ,</l>
     <l n="9">All looking on at the circus parade .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="10">And out at the grounds , when you 've seen the parade ,</l>
     <l n="11">How delicious it is to drink pink lemonade ;</l>
     <l n="12">And look at the elephant twirling his trunk ,</l>
     <l n="13">And laugh at the capers cut by the monk ;</l>
     <l n="14">Watch the old clown who is acting a dunce ,</l>
     <l n="15">And try hard to see three rings going at once ;</l>
     <l n="16">Gaze at the ringmaster cracking his whip ,</l>
     <l n="17">And watch the tight-rope artist skip .</l>
     <l n="18">I saw that circus , Yes Sirree !</l>
     <l n="19">Saw about enough for three .</l>

    <head>LIFE .</head>
     <l n="1">The list is long , the stories read the same ;</l>
     <l n="2">Strong mortal man is but a flesh-hued toy ;</l>
     <l n="3">Some have their ending in a life of shame ;</l>
     <l n="4">Others drink deeply from the glass of joy ;</l>
     <l n="5">Some see the cup dashed dripping from their lip</l>
     <l n="6">Or drinking , find the wine has turned to gall ,</l>
     <l n="7">While others taste the sweets they fain would sip</l>
     <l n="8">And then Death comes — the sequel to it all .</l>

    <head><span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>THE WAR OF THE RATS AND MICE .</head>
     <l n="1">Far back within an age remote ,</l>
     <l n="2">Which common history fails to note ,</l>
     <l n="3">When dogs could talk , and pigs could sing ,</l>
     <l n="4">And frogs obeyed a wooden king ,</l>
     <l n="5">There lived a tribe of rats so mean ,</l>
     <l n="6">That such a set was never seen .</l>
     <l n="7">For during all the livelong day</l>
     <l n="8">They fought and quarrelled in the hay ,</l>
     <l n="9">And then at night they robbed the mice ,</l>
     <l n="10">Who always were so kind and nice .</l>
     <l n="11">They stole their bread , they stole their meat ,</l>
     <l n="12">And all the jam they had to eat ;</l>
     <l n="13">They gobbled up their pies and cake ,</l>
     <l n="14">And everything the mice could bake ;</l>
     <l n="15">They stuffed themselves with good fresh meal ,</l>
     <l n="16">And ruined all they could not steal ;</l>
     <l n="17">They slapped their long tails in the butter</l>
     <l n="18">Until they made a frightful splutter ;</l>
     <l n="19">Then , sleek and fine in coats of silk ,</l>
     <l n="20">They swam about in buttermilk .</l>
     <l n="21">They ate up everything they found ,</l>
     <l n="22">And flung the plates upon the ground .</l>
     <l n="23">And catching three mice by their tails ,</l>
     <l n="24">They drowned them in the water-pails ;</l>
     <l n="25">Then seeing it was morning light ,</l>
     <l n="26">They scampered home with all their might .</l>
     <l n="27">The mouse-tribe living far and near ,</l>
     <l n="28">At once this awful thing did hear ,</l>
     <l n="29">And all declared with cries of rage ,</l>
     <l n="30">A war against the rats they 'd wage .</l>
     <l n="31">The mouse-king blew a trumpet blast ,</l>
     <l n="32">And soon the mice came thick and fast</l>
     <l n="33">From every place , in every manner ,</l>
     <l n="34">And crowded round the royal banner .</l>
     <l n="35">Each had a sword , a bow and arrow ;</l>
     <l n="36">Each felt as brave as any sparrow ,</l>
     <l n="37">And promised , in the coming fight ,</l>
     <l n="38">To die or put the rats to flight .</l>
     <l n="39">The king put on a coat of mail ,</l>
     <l n="40">And tied a bow-knot to his tail ;</l>
     <l n="41">He wore a pistol by his side ,</l>
     <l n="42">And on a bull-frog he did ride .</l>
     <l n="43">“ March on ! ” he cried . And , hot and thick ,</l>
     <l n="44">His army rushed , in double quick .</l>
     <l n="45">And hardly one short hour had waned ,</l>
     <l n="46">Before the ranks the rat-camp gained ,</l>
     <l n="47">With sounding drum and screaming fife ,</l>
     <l n="48">Enough to raise the dead to life .</l>
     <l n="49">The rats , awakened by the clatter ,</l>
     <l n="50">Rushed out to see what was the matter ,</l>
     <l n="51">Then down the whole mouse-army flew ,</l>
     <l n="52">And many thieving rats it slew .</l>
     <l n="53">The mice hurrahed , the rats they squealed ,</l>
     <l n="54">And soon the dreadful battle-field</l>
     <l n="55">Was blue with smoke and red with fire ,</l>
     <l n="56">And filled with blood and savage ire .</l>
     <l n="57">The rats had eaten so much jam ,</l>
     <l n="58">So many pies and so much ham ,</l>
     <l n="59">And were so fat and sick and swollen</l>
     <l n="60">With all the good things they had stolen</l>
     <l n="61">That they could neither fight nor run ;</l>
     <l n="62">And so the mice the battle won .</l>
     <l n="63">They threw up rat-fur in the air ;</l>
     <l n="64">They piled up rat-tails everywhere ;</l>
     <l n="65">And slaughtered rats bestrewed the ground</l>
     <l n="66">For ten or twenty miles around .</l>
     <l n="67">The rat-king galloped from the field</l>
     <l n="68">When all the rest were forced to yield ;</l>
     <l n="69">But though he still retained his skin ,</l>
     <l n="70">He nearly fainted with chagrin ,</l>
     <l n="71">To think that in that bloody tide</l>
     <l n="72">So many of his rats had died .</l>
     <l n="73">Fierce anger blazed within his breast ;</l>
     <l n="74">He would not stop to eat or rest ;</l>
     <l n="75">But spurring up his fiery steed ,</l>
     <l n="76">He seized a sharp and trusty reed —</l>
     <l n="77">Then , wildly shouting , rushed like hail</l>
     <l n="78">To cut off little mouse-king 's tail .</l>
     <l n="79">The mouse-king 's face turned red with passion</l>
     <l n="80">To see a rat come in such fashion ,</l>
     <l n="81">For he had just that minute said</l>
     <l n="82">That every thieving rat was dead .</l>
     <l n="83">The rat was scared , and tried to run ,</l>
     <l n="84">And vowed that he was just in fun ;</l>
     <l n="85">But nought could quell the mouse-king 's fury —</l>
     <l n="86">He cared not then for judge or jury ;</l>
     <l n="87">And with his sharp and quivering spear ,</l>
     <l n="88">He pierced the rat right through the ear .</l>
     <l n="89">The rat fell backward in the clover ,</l>
     <l n="90">Kicked up his legs , and all was over .</l>
     <l n="91">The mice , with loud and joyful tones ,</l>
     <l n="92">Now gathered all the bad rats ’ bones ,</l>
     <l n="93">And with them built a pyramid ,</l>
     <l n="94">Down which their little children slid .</l>
     <l n="95">And after that eventful day</l>
     <l n="96">The mice in peace and joy could play ,</l>
     <l n="97">For now no wicked rats could steal</l>
     <l n="98">Their cakes and jam and pies and meal ,</l>
     <l n="99">Nor catch them by their little tails ,</l>
     <l n="100">And drown them in the water-pails .</l>
