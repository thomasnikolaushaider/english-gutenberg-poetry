       <l n="11">The muttering retreats</l>

       <l n="24">Lingered upon the pools that stand in drains ,</l>
       <l n="25">Let fall upon its back the soot that falls from chimneys ,</l>
       <l n="26">Slipped by the terrace , made a sudden leap ,</l>

        <l n="6">Among the smoke and fog of a December afternoon</l>
        <l n="7">You have the scene arrange itself — as it will seem to do —</l>
        <l n="8">With “ I have saved this afternoon for you ” ;</l>
        <l n="9">And four wax candles in the darkened room ,</l>
        <l n="10">Four rings of light upon the ceiling overhead ,</l>
        <l n="11">An atmosphere of Juliet 's tomb</l>
        <l n="12">Prepared for all the things to be said , or left unsaid .</l>
        <l n="13">We have been , let us say , to hear the latest Pole</l>

       <l n="12">Where worried bodies of drowned men drift down in the green silence ,</l>
       <l n="13">Dropping from fingers of surf .</l>
       <l n="14">I looked for the head of Mr. Apollinax rolling under a chair ,</l>
       <l n="15">Or grinning over a screen</l>
       <l n="16">With seaweed in its hair .</l>
       <l n="17">I heard the beat of centaurs ’ hoofs over the hard turf</l>
       <l n="18">As his dry and passionate talk devoured the afternoon .</l>
       <l n="19">“ He is a charming man ” — “ But after all what did he mean ? ” —</l>
       <l n="20">“ He has pointed ears ... he must be unbalanced , ” —</l>
       <l n="21">“ There was something he said that I might have challenged . ”</l>
       <l n="22">Of dowager Mrs. Phlaccus , and Professor and Mrs. Cheetah</l>
       <l n="23">I remember a slice of lemon and a bitten macaroon .</l>

       <l n="1">Hysteria</l>
     </lg>
     <p>As she laughed I was aware of becoming involved in her laughter and being part of it , until her teeth were only accidental stars with a talent for squad-drill . I was drawn in by short gasps , inhaled at each momentary recovery , lost finally in the dark caverns of her throat , bruised by the ripple of unseen muscles . An elderly waiter with trembling hands was hurriedly spreading a pink and white checked cloth over the rusty green iron table , saying : “ If the lady and gentleman wish to take their tea in the garden , if the lady and gentleman wish to take their tea in the garden ... ” I decided that if the shaking of her breasts could be stopped , some of the fragments of the afternoon might be collected , and I concentrated my attention with careful subtlety to this end .</p>
