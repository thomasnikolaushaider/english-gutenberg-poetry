    <head>PREFACE</head>
    <p n="1">Three years ago I published a volume called Poems : First Series , which contained a collection of what I had written between 1905 and March , 1918 .</p>
    <p n="2">The present collection contains all that I have written since then . The Birds and nine shorter poems were published in a small booklet in 1919 ; The Moon was separately published in 1920 ; but the majority of the poems here printed appear in book form for the first time , and twelve have never previously been published .</p>
    <p n="3">The poems are as nearly as possible in chronological order , except that the group called An Epilogue should have been dated 1917 .</p>
    <p n="4">J. C. S .</p>
    <p n="5">September , 1921 .</p>

Asia had no name till man was old And long had learned the use of iron and gold ; And aeons had passed , when the first corn was planted , Since first the use of syllables was granted . Men were on earth while climates slowly swung , Fanning wide zones to heat and cold , and long Subsidence turned great continents to sea , And seas dried up , dried up interminably , Age after age ; enormous seas were dried Amid wastes of land . And the last monsters died . Earth wore another face . O since that prime Man with how many works has sprinkled time ! Hammering , hewing , digging tunnels , roads ; Building ships , temples , multiform abodes . How , for his body 's appetites , his toils Have conquered all earth 's products , all her soils ; And in what thousand thousand shapes of art He has tried to find a language for his heart ! Never at rest , never content or tired : Insatiate wanderer , marvellously fired , Most grandly piling and piling into the air Stones that will topple or arch he knows not where . And yet did I , this spring , think it more strange , More grand , more full of awe , than all that change , And lovely and sweet and touching unto tears , That through man 's chronicled and unchronicled years , And even into that unguessable beyond The water-hen has nested by a pond , Weaving dry flags into a beaten floor , The one sure product of her only lore . Low on a ledge above the shadowed water Then , when she heard no men , as nature taught her , Flashing around with busy scarlet bill She built that nest , her nest , and builds it still . O let your strong imagination turn The great wheel backward , until Troy unburn , And then unbuild , and seven Troys below Rise out of death , and dwindle , and outflow , Till all have passed , and none has yet been there : Back , ever back . Our birds still crossed the air ; Beyond our myriad changing generations Still built , unchanged , their known inhabitations . A million years before Atlantis was Our lark sprang from some hollow in the grass , Some old soft hoof-print in a tussock 's shade ; And the wood-pigeon 's smooth snow-white eggs were laid , High amid green pines ’ sunset-coloured shafts , And rooks their villages of twiggy rafts Set on the tops of elms , where elms grew then , And still the thumbling tit and perky wren Popped through the tiny doors of cosy balls And the blackbird lined with moss his high-built walls ; A round mud cottage held the thrush 's young , And straws from the untidy sparrow 's hung . And , skimming forktailed in the evening air , When man first was were not the martins there ? Did not those birds some human shelter crave , And stow beneath the cornice of his cave Their dry tight cups of clay ? And from each door Peeped on a morning wiseheads three or four . Yes , daw and owl , curlew and crested hern , Kingfisher , mallard , water-rail and tern , Chaffinch and greenfinch , wagtail , stonechat , ruff , Whitethroat and robin , fly-catcher and chough , Missel-thrush , magpie , sparrow-hawk and jay , Built , those far ages gone , in this year 's way . And the first man who walked the cliffs of Rame , As I this year , looked down and saw the same Blotches of rusty red on ledge and cleft With grey-green spots on them , while right and left A dizzying tangle of gulls were floating and flying , Wheeling and crossing and darting , crying and crying , Circling and crying , over and over and over , Crying with swoop and hover and fall and recover . And below on a rock against the grey sea fretted , Pipe-necked and stationary and silhouetted , Cormorants stood in a wise , black , equal row Above the nests and long blue eggs we know . O delicate chain over all the ages stretched , O dumb tradition from what far darkness fetched : Each little architect with its one design Perpetual , fixed and right in stuff and line , Each little ministrant who knows one thing , One learned rite to celebrate the spring . Whatever alters else on sea or shore , These are unchanging : man must still explore .</item>

     <head>A DOG 'S DEATH</head>
     <lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="2">The loose earth falls in the grave like a peaceful regular breathing ;</l>
       <l n="3">Too like , for I was deceived a moment by the sound :</l>
       <l n="4">It has covered the heap of bracken that the gardener laid above him ;</l>
       <l n="5">Quiet the spade swings : there we have now his mound .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="6">A patch of fresh earth on the floor of the wood 's renewing chamber :</l>
       <l n="7">All around is grass and moss and the hyacinth 's dark green sprouts :</l>
       <l n="8">And oaks are above that were old when his fiftieth sire was a puppy :</l>
       <l n="9">And far away in the garden I hear the children 's shouts .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="10">Their joy is remote as a dream . It is strange how we buy our sorrow</l>
       <l n="11">For the touch of perishing things , idly , with open eyes ;</l>
       <l n="12">How we give our hearts to brutes that will die in a few seasons ,</l>
       <l n="13">Nor trouble what we do when we do it ; nor would have it otherwise .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">Long ago I knew that brown integument ,</l>
       <l n="2">Like a dead husk , had dormant life within it ,</l>
       <l n="3">And waited till a first white point appeared</l>
       <l n="4">Which shot into a naked stiff pale spike</l>
       <l n="5">That grew .</l>
       <l n="6">I knew this was not all ;</l>
       <l n="7">Nothing I said as greener you grew and taller ,</l>
       <l n="8">But dreamed alone of the day when your bud would unsheathe ,</l>
       <l n="9">And silently swell , and at last your crown would break</l>
       <l n="10">Filling the air with clouds of colour and fragrance ,</l>
       <l n="11">Radiant waves , odours of immortality .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="12">In a pot of earth I watered and tended you ,</l>
       <l n="13">Breaking the clods and soaking the earth with water</l>
       <l n="14">That fed your roots and eased your way to the light .</l>
       <l n="15">I gave you the sun and the rain</l>
       <l n="16">But saved you from scorching and drowning :</l>
       <l n="17">You are mine , and only I know you ,</l>
       <l n="18">And the ways of your growth , and the days .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="19">But you are not from me .</l>
       <l n="20">I am but a pen for a hand ,</l>
       <l n="21">A bed for a river ,</l>
       <l n="22">A window for light .</l>
       <l n="23">And I bow in awe to that Power</l>
       <l n="24">That made you a flower .</l>

       <head>I</head>
       <lg type="stanza" n="1">
        <l n="1">I find my mind as it were a deep water .</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="2">
        <l n="2">Sometimes I play with a thought and hammer and bend it ,</l>
        <l n="3">Till tired and displeased with that I toss it away ,</l>
        <l n="4">Or absently let it slip to the yawning water :</l>
        <l n="5">And down it sinks , forgotten for many a day .</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="3">
        <l n="6">But a time comes when tide or tempest washes it</l>
        <l n="7">High on the beach , and I find that shape of mine ,</l>
        <l n="8">Or I haul it out from the depths on some casual rope ,</l>
        <l n="9">Or , passing over that spot in quiet shine ,</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="4">
        <l n="10">I see , where my boat 's shadow makes deep the water ,</l>
        <l n="11">A patch of colour , far down , from the bottom apart ,</l>
        <l n="12">A wavering sign like the gleam from an ancient anchor ,</l>
        <l n="13">Brown fixing and fleeting flakes ; and I feel my heart</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="5">
        <l n="14">Wake to a strange excitement ; so that I stop ,</l>
        <l n="15">Put up my paddles and dredge with a careful net :</l>
        <l n="16">And I catch it , and see it stir , and feel its weight ,</l>
        <l n="17">And pull till it nears and breaks from the water wet .</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="6">
        <l n="18">And my eyes dwell on that old abandoned thing</l>
        <l n="19">Recovered by chance . For the shape I had found so dull</l>
        <l n="20">Has crusted and changed in secrecy and silence ,</l>
        <l n="21">And its surface shines like a pearl , most beautiful .</l>

       <lg type="stanza" n="7">
        <l n="22">In bed I lie , and my thoughts come filing by ,</l>
        <l n="23">All forms and faces , cheerful , serene and sad :</l>
        <l n="24">Some clear , some mistily showing and fragmentary ,</l>
        <l n="25">Some altered in size or shape since last they were seen .</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="8">
        <l n="26">But O last , you group of merry ones !</l>
        <l n="27">Lord knows when I saw you before , but I met you once ,</l>
        <l n="28">The whole collection of you , impudent-eyed ;</l>
        <l n="29">And now , rosy and grinning , with linked arms</l>
        <l n="30">You go swingingly by , turning your faces to mine ,</l>
        <l n="31">I laugh aloud ; you bad lots ; you are a secret ,</l>
        <l n="32">That nobody else knows .</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="9">
        <l n="33">And you it was that made me break the procession</l>
        <l n="34">( While memory gave me still the power of summons ) ,</l>
        <l n="35">And call up all I could of a half-hour 's thoughts</l>
        <l n="36">To parade them across this proscenium of my skull</l>
        <l n="37">In the order they came in , more carefully recognising</l>
        <l n="38">The old , and remarking which have developed or changed .</l>
        <l n="39">And as for you , you rogues , I am almost certain</l>
        <l n="40">There are one or two more of you now than once there were .</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="10">
        <l n="41">Good-bye ! Good-bye ! Dance through the dark door</l>
        <l n="42">In to the life that somewhere else you lead .</l>
        <l n="43">And one day I shall all unwittingly call</l>
        <l n="44">Some word you know as a signal , or you 'll see</l>
        <l n="45">Someone else coming my way ; you 'll suddenly follow ,</l>
        <l n="46">And you 'll appear again , quite possibly</l>
        <l n="47">Bringing new friends — who are sure to be just as bad .</l>

        <l n="48">Into the pits of my heart and brain ,</l>
        <l n="49">My eyes , ears , nose , tongue , fingers , like five gardeners</l>
        <l n="50">Are shovelling sights , sounds , odours , savours , contacts ,</l>
        <l n="51">While I , their master , casually nod , and most times</l>
        <l n="52">Stand idly by , looking at something else ,</l>
        <l n="53">Forgetting that the work is going on</l>
        <l n="54">And only fully conscious of my servants</l>
        <l n="55">When something they move is consonant with my mood</l>
        <l n="56">And draws my notice ; or some other thing ,</l>
        <l n="57">More strange than usual or stronger in its impact ,</l>
        <l n="58">Makes them exclaim and call to bid me watch .</l>

       <lg type="stanza" n="12">
        <l n="59">And then in a ground of more than our dimensions</l>

        <l n="61">They are buried in those illimitable fields ,</l>

        <l n="63">The steady hours passing in procession</l>
        <l n="64">Walk over them and trample them well down</l>
        <l n="65">Out of sight , levelling all the soil .</l>

       <lg type="stanza" n="13">
        <l n="66">Then some time my returning feet uncover them</l>

        <l n="68">Or else perhaps I come and idly dig</l>
        <l n="69">To see what thing I can find , and out there comes</l>
        <l n="70">Some old form buried twenty years ago</l>
        <l n="71">Now called a memory .</l>

        <l n="9">As men fought in the houses below ,</l>
        <l n="10">A shell from an English battery came</l>
        <l n="11">And tore a hole in the tower below you ,</l>

       <l n="5">Her current rippled past invisibly .</l>
       <l n="6">No stir was in the dark and windless meadows ,</l>
       <l n="7">Only the water , whispering in the shadows ,</l>
       <l n="8">That darkened nature lived did still proclaim .</l>
       <l n="9">An hour I stood in that defeat of sight ,</l>
       <l n="10">Waiting , and then a sudden silver flame</l>

       <l n="15">And now there falls a gleaming , lengthening track</l>

       <l n="17">Burnished and flat , not shaken by a quiver .</l>

        <l n="48">Yet all find room , the dribbles of black disappear</l>
        <l n="49">In the solid piles around that empty green ,</l>
        <l n="50">We are packed and ready now . They might as well start ,</l>
        <l n="51">But two-forty-five was their time , and it 's only ten past ,</l>
        <l n="52">And it 's got to be lived through . I have n't a newspaper ,</l>
        <l n="53">I wish I could steal that little parson 's book .</l>
        <l n="54">I count three minutes slowly : they seem like an hour ;</l>
        <l n="55">And then I change feet and loosen the brim of my hat ,</l>
        <l n="56">And curse the crawling of time . Oh body , body !</l>
        <l n="57">Why did I order you here , to stand and feel tired ,</l>
        <l n="58">To ache and ache when the time will never pass ,</l>
        <l n="59">In this buzzing crowd , before all those laden housetops ,</l>
        <l n="60">Around this turf , under the lid of the sky ?</l>
        <l n="61">I fumble my watch again : it is two-twenty :</l>
        <l n="62">Twenty-five minutes to wait . One , two , three , four ,</l>
        <l n="63">Five , six , seven , eight : what is the good of counting ?</l>
        <l n="64">It wo n't be here any quicker , aching hips ,</l>
        <l n="65">Bored brain , unquiet heart , you are doomed to wait .</l>
        <l n="66">Why did I make you come ? We have been before ,</l>
        <l n="67">Struggling with time , fatigued and dull and alone</l>
        <l n="68">In all this tumultuous , chattering , happy crowd</l>
        <l n="69">That never knew pain and never questions its acts ...</l>
        <l n="70">Never questions ? Do not deceive yourself .</l>
        <l n="71">Look at the faces around you , active and gay ,</l>
        <l n="72">They are lined , there are brains behind them , breasts beneath them ,</l>
        <l n="73">They have only escaped for an hour , and even now</l>
        <l n="74">Many , like you , have not escaped ; and away</l>
        <l n="75">Across the field those faces ascending in tiers ,</l>
        <l n="76">Each face is a story , a tragedy and a doubt ;</l>
        <l n="77">And the teams where they wait , in the sacred place to the right ,</l>
        <l n="78">Are bewildered souls , who have heard of and brooded on death ,</l>
        <l n="79">And thought about God . But this is a football match ;</l>
        <l n="80">And anyhow I do n't feel equal to thinking ,</l>
        <l n="81">And I 'm certain the teams do n't ; they 've something better to do .</l>
        <l n="82">It is half-past two , and , thank Heaven , a minute over .</l>
        <l n="83">We are all here now . The laggards have all booked seats</l>
        <l n="84">And stroll in lordly leisure along the front .</l>
        <l n="85">What a man ! Six foot , silk hat , brown face , moustache !</l>
        <l n="86">What a fat complacent parson , snuggling down</l>
        <l n="87">In the chair there , among all his cackling ladies !</l>
        <l n="88">I have seen that youth before . My neighbour now</l>
        <l n="89">On my left shouts out to a college friend below us ,</l>
        <l n="90">“ Tommy ! Hallo ! Do you think we are going to beat ‘ em ? ”</l>
        <l n="91">My watch . Twenty-to-three . That lot went quickly ;</l>
        <l n="92">Five minutes more is nothing ; I 'm lively now</l>
        <l n="93">And fit for a five-mile run . One , two , three , four ...</l>
        <l n="94">It is n't worth bothering now , it 's all but here ,</l>
        <l n="95">Here , here ; a rustle , a murmur , a ready silence ,</l>
        <l n="96">A billowing cheer — why , here they come , running and passing ,</l>
        <l n="97">The challenging team ! By God , what magnificent fellows !</l>
        <l n="98">They have dropped the ball , they pause , they sweep onward again ,</l>
        <l n="99">And so to the end . Here are the rest of them ,</l>
        <l n="100">Swingingly up the field and back as they came ,</l>
        <l n="101">With the cheers swelling and swelling . They disappear ,</l>
        <l n="102">And out , like wind upon water , come their rivals ,</l>
        <l n="103">With cheers swelling and swelling , to run and turn</l>
        <l n="104">And vanish ; and now they are all come out together ,</l>
        <l n="105">Two teams walking , touch-judges and referee .</l>
        <l n="106">And they all line up , dotted about like chessmen ,</l>
        <l n="107">And the multitude holds its breath , and awaits the start .</l>

        <l n="192">Its grandeur gone , while the touch-judge flaps his flag ,</l>
        <l n="193">And the multitude becomes an enormous din</l>
        <l n="194">Which dies as the game resumes , and then rises again ,</l>

        <l n="206">Feel the time fly to the dreaded last wail of the whistle ,</l>
        <l n="207">And see our team as desperate waves that dash</l>
        <l n="208">Against a wall of rock , to be scattered in spray .</l>
        <l n="209">Yet fervour comes back , for the players have no thought for the past</l>
        <l n="210">Except as a goad to new effort , not they will be chilled :</l>
        <l n="211">Fiercer and faster they fight , a grimness comes</l>
        <l n="212">Into shoving and running and tackling and handing off .</l>
        <l n="213">We are heeling the ball now cleanly , time after time</l>

        <l n="218">Thirty fighting devils , ten thousand throats ,</l>
        <l n="219">Thundering joy at each pass and tackle and punt ,</l>
        <l n="220">Yet the consciousness grows that the time approaches the end ,</l>
        <l n="221">The threat of conclusion grows like a spreading tree</l>
        <l n="222">And casts its shadow on all the anxious people ,</l>
        <l n="223">And is fully known when they stop as a man 's knocked out</l>

        <l n="233">Nothing can happen now . The attention drifts .</l>
        <l n="234">There 's a pause ; I become a separate thing again ,</l>
        <l n="235">Almost forget the game , forget my neighbours ,</l>
        <l n="236">And the noise fades in my ears to a dim rumour .</l>
        <l n="237">I watch the lines and colours of field and buildings ,</l>
        <l n="238">So simple and soft and few in the vapoury air ,</l>

        <l n="242">The harmonious sadness of twilight on willowed waters ,</l>
        <l n="243">Still avenues or harbours seen from the sea .</l>
        <l n="244">Yet a louder shout recalls me , I wake again ,</l>
        <l n="245">Find there are two minutes left , and it 's nearly over ,</l>
        <l n="246">See a few weaklings already walking out ,</l>
        <l n="247">Caring more to avoid a crush with the crowd</l>
        <l n="248">Than to give the last stroke to a ritual of courtesy</l>
        <l n="249">And a work of intangible art . But we 're all getting ready ,</l>
        <l n="250">Hope gone , and fear , except in the battling teams .</l>
        <l n="251">Regret ... a quick movement of hazy forms ,</l>
        <l n="252">Oh quiet , oh look , there is something happening ,</l>
        <l n="253">Sudden one phantom form on the other wing</l>
        <l n="254">Emerges from nothingness , is singled out ,</l>
        <l n="255">Curving in a long sweep like a flying gull ,</l>
        <l n="256">Through the thick fog , swifter as borne by wind ,</l>
        <l n="257">Swerves at the place where the corner-flag must be ,</l>
        <l n="258">And runs , by Heaven he 's over ! and runs , and runs ,</l>
        <l n="259">And our hearts leap , and our sticks go up in the air</l>
        <l n="260">And our hats whirl , and we lose ourselves in a yell</l>

        <l n="294">Of all that ; effort and pain . Yet , sooner or later ,</l>
        <l n="295">As much may be said of any human game ,</l>
        <l n="296">War , politics , art , building , planting and ploughing ,</l>
        <l n="297">The explorer 's freezing , the astronomer 's searching of stars ,</l>
        <l n="298">The philosopher 's fight through the thickening webs of thought ,</l>
        <l n="299">And the writing of poems : a hand , a stir and a sinking .</l>
        <l n="300">And so , no more , of the general game of the Race ,</l>
        <l n="301">That cannot know of its origin or its end ,</l>
        <l n="302">But strives , for their own sake , its courage and skill</l>
        <l n="303">To increase , till Frost or a Flying Flame calls “ Time ! ”</l>
        <l n="304">I have seen this day men in the beauty of movement ,</l>
        <l n="305">A gallant jaw set , the form of a hero that flew ,</l>
        <l n="306">Cunning , a selfless flinging of self in the fray ,</l>
        <l n="307">Strength , compassion , control , the obeying of laws ,</l>
        <l n="308">Victory , and a struggle against defeat .</l>
        <l n="309">I think that the Power that gave us the bodies we have ,</l>
        <l n="310">Can only be praised by our use of the things He gave ,</l>
        <l n="311">That we are not here to turn our backs to the sun ,</l>
        <l n="312">Or to scorn the delight of our limbs . And for those who have eyes</l>
        <l n="313">The beauty of this is the same as the beauty of flowers ,</l>
        <l n="314">And of eagles and lions and mountains and oceans and stars ,</l>
        <l n="315">And I care not , but rather am glad that the thought will recur</l>
        <l n="316">That in Egypt the muscles moved under the shining skins</l>
        <l n="317">As here , and in Greece where Olympian champions died ,</l>
        <l n="318">And in isles long ago , where never a record was kept .</l>
        <l n="319">And now I 'll go home , and open a bottle of port ,</l>
        <l n="320">And think upon beauty and God and the wonder of love ,</l>
        <l n="321">That laughs at the shadow of Death , and my vanished youth ,</l>
        <l n="322">And the throbbing heart that beats its own drum to the grave ,</l>
        <l n="323">Returning absurdly again to the fact that we won ,</l>
        <l n="324">Content to let darkness deepen , and stars shine .</l>
