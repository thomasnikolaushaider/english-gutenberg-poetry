    </epigraph>
    <docTitle><titlePart>A Song of the Guns was written under what are probably the most remarkable conditions in which a poem has ever been composed . The author , who is now serving in Flanders , was present at the battle of Loos , and during a lull in the fighting — when the gunners , who had been sleepless for five nights , were resting like tired dogs under their guns — he jotted down the main theme of the poem . After the battle the artillery brigade to which he was attached was ordered to Ypres , and it was during the long trench warfare in this district , within sight of the ruined tower of Ypres Cathedral , that the poem was finally completed . The last three stanzas were written at midnight in Brigade Headquarters with the German shells screaming over into the ruined town .</titlePart></docTitle>

    <docTitle><titlePart>A SONG OF THE GUNS These are our masters , the slim Grim muzzles that irk in the pit ; That chafe for the rushing of wheels , For the teams plunging madly to bit As the gunners wing down to unkey , For the trails sweeping half-circle-right , For the six breech-blocks clashing as one To a target viewed clear on the sight — Gray masses the shells search and tear Into fragments that bunch as they run — For the hour of the red battle-harvest , The dream of the slaves of the gun ! We have bartered our souls to the guns ; Every fibre of body and brain Have we trained to them , chained to them . Serfs ? Aye ! but proud of the weight of our chain , Of our backs that are bowed to their workings , To hide them and guard and disguise , Of our ears that are deafened with service , Of hands that are scarred , and of eyes Grown hawklike with marking their prey , Of wings that are slashed as with swords When we hover , the turn of a blade From the death that is sweet to our lords .</titlePart></docTitle>

     <head>HEADQUARTERS</head>
     <p>A league and a league from the trenches , from the traversed maze of the lines ,— Where daylong the sniper watches and daylong the bullet whines , And the cratered earth is in travail with mines and with countermines ,—</p>
     <p>Here , where haply some woman dreamed , ( are those her roses that bloom In the garden beyond the windows of my littered working-room ? ) We have decked the map for our masters as a bride is decked for the groom .</p>
     <p>Here , on each numbered lettered square ,— cross-road and mound and wire , Loophole , redoubt , and emplacement , are the targets their mouths desire ,— Gay with purples and browns and blues , have we traced them their arcs of fire .</p>
     <p>And ever the type-keys clatter ; and ever our keen wires bring Word from the watchers a-crouch below , word from the watchers a-wing ; And ever we hear the distant growl of our hid guns thundering ;</p>
     <p>Hear it hardly , and turn again to our maps , where the trench-lines crawl , Red on the gray and each with a sign for the ranging shrapnel 's fall — Snakes that our masters shall scotch at dawn , as is written here on the wall .</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">For the weeks of our waiting draw to a close ....</l>
       <l n="2">There is scarcely a leaf astir</l>
       <l n="3">In the garden beyond my windows where the</l>
       <l n="4">twilight shadows blur</l>
       <l n="5">The blaze of some woman 's roses ....</l>

      <head>GUN-TEAMS</head>
      <head>Their rugs are sodden , their heads are down , their tails are turned to the storm . ( Would you know them , you that groomed them in the sleek fat days of peace ,— When the tiles rang to their pawings in the lighted stalls and warm ,— Now the foul clay cakes on breeching-strap and clogs the quick-release ? )</head>
       <l n="1">The blown rain stings , there is never a star , the</l>
       <l n="2">tracks are rivers of slime .</l>
       <l n="3">( You must harness up by guesswork with a</l>
       <l n="4">failing torch for light ,</l>
       <l n="5">Instep-deep in unmade standings , for it 's active-service time ,</l>
       <l n="6">And our resting weeks are over , and we move</l>
       <l n="7">the guns to-night . )</l>
     </lg>
     <p>The iron tires slither , the traces sag ; their blind hooves stumble and slide ; They are war-worn , they are weary , soaked with sweat and sopped with rain . ( You must hold them , you must help them , swing your lead and centre wide Where the greasy granite pave peters out to squelching drain . )</p>
     <p>There is shrapnel bursting a mile in front on the road that the guns must take : ( You are nervous , you are thoughtful , you are shifting in your seat , As you watch the ragged feathers flicker orange flame and break ) — But the teams are pulling steady down the battered village street .</p>
     <p>You have shod them cold , and their coats are long , and their bellies gray with the mud ; They have done with gloss and polish , but the fighting heart 's unbroke . We , who saw them hobbling after us down white roads flecked with blood , Patient , wondering why we left them , till we lost them in the smoke ;</p>
     <p>Who have felt them shiver between our knees , when the shells rain black from the skies , When the bursting terrors find us and the lines stampede as one ; Who have watched the pierced limbs quiver and the pain in stricken eyes , Know the worth of humble servants , foolish-faithful to their gun !</p>

      <head>Ere the last light that leaps the night has hung and shone and died , While yet the breast-high fog of dawn is swathed about the plain , By hedge and track our slaves go back , the waning stars for guide , Eyes of our mouths ; the mists have cleared , the guns would speak again !</head>

      <head>THE VOICE OF THE GUNS</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">We are the guns , and your masters ! Saw ye our flashes ?</l>
       <l n="2">Heard ye the scream of our shells in the night , and the</l>
       <l n="3">shuddering crashes ?</l>
       <l n="4">Saw ye our work by the roadside , the gray wounded lying ,</l>
       <l n="5">Moaning to God that he made them — the maimed and the dying ?</l>
       <l n="6">Husbands or sons ,</l>
       <l n="7">Fathers or lovers , we break them ! We are the guns !</l>

       <l n="8">We are the guns and ye serve us ! Dare ye grow weary ,</l>
       <l n="9">Steadfast at nighttime , at noontime ; or waking , when dawn</l>
       <l n="10">winds blow dreary</l>
       <l n="11">Over the fields and the flats and the reeds of the barrier</l>
       <l n="12">water ,</l>
       <l n="13">To wait on the hour of our choosing , the minute decided for</l>
       <l n="14">slaughter ?</l>
       <l n="15">Swift the clock runs ;</l>
       <l n="16">Yes , to the ultimate second . Stand to your guns !</l>

       <l n="17">We are the guns and we need you ! Here in the timbered</l>
       <l n="18">Pits that are screened by the crest and the copse</l>
       <l n="19">where at dusk ye unlimbered ,</l>
       <l n="20">Pits that one found us — and , finding , gave life ( did</l>
       <l n="21">he flinch from the giving ? ) ;</l>
       <l n="22">Laboured by moonlight when wraith of the dead</l>
       <l n="23">brooded yet o'er the living ,</l>
       <l n="24">Ere with the sun 's</l>
       <l n="25">Rising the sorrowful spirit abandoned its guns .</l>

       <l n="26">Who but the guns shall avenge him ? Strip us for action !</l>

       <l n="28">refraction .</l>

       <l n="32">of the barrel recoiling</l>
       <l n="33">Deafens and stuns !</l>
       <l n="34">Vengeance is ours for our servants . Trust ye the guns !</l>

       <l n="38">Grow the limbs lax , and unsteady the hands , which</l>
       <l n="39">aforetime we trusted ;</l>

       <l n="41">steel of hardihood rusted ?</l>
       <l n="42">Dominant ones ,</l>

       <l n="44">Ye are the guns ! Are we worthy ? Shall not these speak for</l>
       <l n="45">us ,</l>
       <l n="46">Out of the woods where the torn trees are slashed with</l>
       <l n="47">the vain bolts that seek for us ,</l>
       <l n="48">Thunder of batteries firing in unison , swish of shell</l>
       <l n="49">flighting ,</l>

       <l n="54">Yea ! by your works are ye justified ,— toil unrelieved ;</l>

       <l n="60">Courage that shuns</l>
       <l n="61">Only foolhardiness ;— even by these are ye worthy your guns !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="62">Wherefore — and unto ye only — power has been given ;</l>
       <l n="63">Yea ! beyond man , over men , over desolate cities and riven ;</l>
       <l n="64">Yea ! beyond space , over earth and the seas and the</l>
       <l n="65">sky 's high dominions ;</l>

       <l n="68">Vigilant ones ,</l>
