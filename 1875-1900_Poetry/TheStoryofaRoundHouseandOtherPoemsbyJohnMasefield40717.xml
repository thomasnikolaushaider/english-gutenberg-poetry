      <head>I</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">Four bells were struck , the watch was called on deck ,</l>
       <l n="2">All work aboard was over for the hour ,</l>
       <l n="3">And some men sang and others played at check ,</l>
       <l n="4">Or mended clothes or watched the sunset glower .</l>
       <l n="5">The bursting west was like an opening flower ,</l>
       <l n="6">And one man watched it till the light was dim ,</l>
       <l n="7">But no one went across to talk to him .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="8">He was the painter in that swift ship 's crew ,</l>
       <l n="9">Lampman and painter — tall , a slight-built man ,</l>
       <l n="10">Young for his years , and not yet twenty-two ;</l>
       <l n="11">Sickly , and not yet brown with the sea 's tan .</l>
       <l n="12">Bullied and damned at since the voyage</l>
       <l n="13">“ Being neither man nor seaman by his tally , ”</l>
       <l n="14">He bunked with the idlers just abaft the galley .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="15">His work began at five ; he worked all day ,</l>
       <l n="16">Keeping no watch and having all night in .</l>
       <l n="17">His work was what the mate might care to say ;</l>
       <l n="18">He mixed red lead in many a bouilli tin ;</l>
       <l n="19">His dungarees were smeared with paraffin .</l>
       <l n="20">“ Go drown himself ” his round-house mates advised him ,</l>
       <l n="21">And all hands called him “ Dauber ” and despised him .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="22">Si , the apprentice , stood beside the spar ,</l>
       <l n="23">Stripped to the waist , a basin at his side ,</l>
       <l n="24">Slushing his hands to get away the tar ,</l>
       <l n="25">And then he washed himself and rinsed and dried ;</l>
       <l n="26">Towelling his face , hair-towzelled , eager eyed ,</l>
       <l n="27">He crossed the spar to Dauber , and there stood</l>
       <l n="28">Watching the gold of heaven turn to blood .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="29">They stood there by the rail while the swift ship</l>
       <l n="30">Tore on out of the tropics , straining her sheets ,</l>
       <l n="31">Whitening her trackway to a milky strip ,</l>
       <l n="32">Dim with green bubbles and twisted water meets ,</l>
       <l n="33">Her clacking tackle tugged at pins and cleats ,</l>
       <l n="34">Her great sails bellied stiff , her great masts leaned :</l>
       <l n="35">They watched how the seas struck and burst and greened .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="36">Si talked with Dauber , standing by the side .</l>
       <l n="37">“ Why did you come to sea , painter ? ” he said .</l>
       <l n="38">“ I want to be a painter , ” he replied ,</l>
       <l n="39">“ And know the sea and ships from A to Z ,</l>
       <l n="40">And paint great ships at sea before I 'm dead ;</l>
       <l n="41">Ships under skysails running down the Trade —</l>
       <l n="42">Ships and the sea ; there 's nothing finer made .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="43">“ But there 's so much to learn , with sails and ropes ,</l>
       <l n="44">And how the sails look , full or being furled ,</l>
       <l n="45">And how the lights change in the troughs and slopes ,</l>
       <l n="46">And the sea 's colours up and down the world ,</l>
       <l n="47">And how a storm looks when the sprays are hurled</l>
       <l n="48">High as the yard ( they say ) I want to see ;</l>
       <l n="49">There 's none ashore can teach such things to me .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="50">“ And then the men and rigging , and the way</l>
       <l n="51">Ships move , running or beating , and the poise</l>
       <l n="52">At the roll 's end , the checking in the sway —</l>
       <l n="53">I want to paint them perfect , short of the noise ;</l>
       <l n="54">And then the life , the half-decks full of boys ,</l>
       <l n="55">The fo'c ' sles with the men there , dripping wet :</l>
       <l n="56">I know the subjects that I want to get .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="9">
       <l n="57">“ It 's not been done , the sea , not yet been done ,</l>
       <l n="58">From the inside , by one who really knows ;</l>
       <l n="59">I 'd give up all if I could be the one ,</l>
       <l n="60">But art comes dear the way the money goes .</l>
       <l n="61">So I have come to sea , and I suppose</l>
       <l n="62">Three years will teach me all I want to learn</l>
       <l n="63">And make enough to keep me till I earn . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="10">
       <l n="64">Even as he spoke his busy pencil moved ,</l>
       <l n="65">Drawing the leap of water off the side</l>
       <l n="66">Where the great clipper trampled iron-hooved ,</l>
       <l n="67">Making the blue hills of the sea divide ,</l>
       <l n="68">Shearing a glittering scatter in her stride ,</l>
       <l n="69">And leaping on full tilt with all sails drawing ,</l>
       <l n="70">Proud as a war-horse , snuffing battle , pawing .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="11">
       <l n="71">“ I cannot get it yet — not yet , ” he said ;</l>
       <l n="72">“ That leap and light , and sudden change to green ,</l>
       <l n="73">And all the glittering from the sunset 's red ,</l>
       <l n="74">And the milky colours where the bursts have been ,</l>
       <l n="75">And then the clipper striding like a queen</l>
       <l n="76">Over it all , all beauty to the crown .</l>
       <l n="77">I see it all , I cannot put it down .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="12">
       <l n="78">“ It 's hard not to be able . There , look there !</l>
       <l n="79">I cannot get the movement nor the light ;</l>
       <l n="80">Sometimes it almost makes a man despair</l>
       <l n="81">To try and try and never get it right .</l>
       <l n="82">Oh , if I could — oh , if I only might ,</l>
       <l n="83">I would n't mind what hells I 'd have to pass ,</l>
       <l n="84">Not if the whole world called me fool and ass . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="13">
       <l n="85">Down sank the crimson sun into the sea ,</l>
       <l n="86">The wind cut chill at once , the west grew dun .</l>
       <l n="87">“ Out sidelights ! ” called the mate . “ Hi , where is he ? ”</l>
       <l n="88">The Boatswain called , “ Out sidelights , damn you ! Run ! ”</l>
       <l n="89">“ He 's always late or lazing , ” murmured one —</l>
       <l n="90">“ The Dauber , with his sketching . ” Soon the tints</l>
       <l n="91">Of red and green passed on dark water-glints .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="14">
       <l n="92">Darker it grew , still darker , and the stars</l>
       <l n="93">Burned golden , and the fiery fishes came .</l>
       <l n="94">The wire-note loudened from the straining spars ;</l>
       <l n="95">The sheet-blocks clacked together always the same ;</l>
       <l n="96">The rushing fishes streaked the seas with flame ,</l>
       <l n="97">Racing the one speed noble as their own :</l>
       <l n="98">What unknown joy was in those fish unknown !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="15">
       <l n="99">Just by the round-house door , as it grew dark ,</l>
       <l n="100">The Boatswain caught the Dauber with , “ Now , you ;</l>
       <l n="101">Till now I 've spared you , damn you ! now you hark :</l>
       <l n="102">I 've just had hell for what you did n't do ;</l>
       <l n="103">I 'll have you broke and sent among the crew</l>
       <l n="104">If you get me more trouble by a particle .</l>
       <l n="105">Do n't you forget , you daubing , useless article !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="16">
       <l n="106">“ You thing , you twice-laid thing from Port Mahon ! ”</l>
       <l n="107">Then came the Cook 's “ Is that the Dauber there ?</l>
       <l n="108">Why do n't you leave them stinking paints alone ?</l>
       <l n="109">They stink the house out , poisoning all the air .</l>
       <l n="110">Just take them out . ” “ Where to ? ” “ I do n't care where .</l>
       <l n="111">I wo n't have stinking paint here . ” From their plates :</l>
       <l n="112">“ That 's right ; wet paint breeds fever , ” growled his mates .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="17">
       <l n="113">He took his still wet drawings from the berth</l>
       <l n="114">And climbed the ladder to the deck-house top ;</l>
       <l n="115">Beneath , the noisy half-deck rang with mirth ,</l>
       <l n="116">For two ship 's boys were putting on the strop :</l>
       <l n="117">One , clambering up to let the skylight drop ,</l>
       <l n="118">Saw him bend down beneath a boat and lay</l>
       <l n="119">His drawings there , till all were hid away ,</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="18">
       <l n="120">And stand there silent , leaning on the boat ,</l>
       <l n="121">Watching the constellations rise and burn ,</l>
       <l n="122">Until the beauty took him by the throat ,</l>
       <l n="123">So stately is their glittering overturn ;</l>
       <l n="124">Armies of marching eyes , armies that yearn</l>
       <l n="125">With banners rising and falling , and passing by</l>
       <l n="126">Over the empty silence of the sky .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="19">
       <l n="127">The Dauber sighed there looking at the sails ,</l>
       <l n="128">Wind-steadied arches leaning on the night ,</l>
       <l n="129">The high trucks traced on heaven and left no trails ;</l>
       <l n="130">The moonlight made the topsails almost white ,</l>
       <l n="131">The passing sidelight seemed to drip green light .</l>
       <l n="132">And on the clipper rushed with fire-bright bows ;</l>
       <l n="133">He sighed , “ I 'll never do't , ” and left the house .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="20">
       <l n="134">“ Now , ” said the reefer , “ up ! Come , Sam ; come , Si ,</l>
       <l n="135">Dauber 's been hiding something . ” Up they slid ,</l>
       <l n="136">Treading on naked tiptoe stealthily</l>
       <l n="137">To grope for treasure at the long-boat skid .</l>
       <l n="138">“ Drawings ! ” said Sam . “ Is this what Dauber hid ?</l>
       <l n="139">Lord ! I expected pudding , not this rot .</l>
       <l n="140">Still , come , we 'll have some fun with what we 've got . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="21">
       <l n="141">They smeared the paint with turpentine until</l>
       <l n="142">They could remove with mess-clouts every trace</l>
       <l n="143">Of quick perception caught by patient skill ,</l>
       <l n="144">And lines that had brought blood into his face .</l>
       <l n="145">They wiped the pigments off , and did erase ,</l>
       <l n="146">With knives , all sticking clots . When they had done .</l>
       <l n="147">Under the boat they laid them every one .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="22">
       <l n="148">All he had drawn since first he came to sea ,</l>
       <l n="149">His six weeks ’ leisure fruits , they laid them there .</l>
       <l n="150">They chuckled then to think how mad he 'd be</l>
       <l n="151">Finding his paintings vanished into air .</l>
       <l n="152">Eight bells were struck , and feet from everywhere</l>
       <l n="153">Went shuffling aft to muster in the dark ;</l>
       <l n="154">The mate 's pipe glowed above , a dim red spark .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="23">
       <l n="155">Names in the darkness passed and voices cried ;</l>
       <l n="156">The red spark glowed and died , the faces seemed</l>
       <l n="157">As things remembered when a brain has died ,</l>
       <l n="158">To all but high intenseness deeply dreamed .</l>
       <l n="159">Like hissing spears the fishes ’ fire streamed ,</l>
       <l n="160">And on the clipper rushed with tossing mast ,</l>
       <l n="161">A bath of flame broke round her as she passed .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="24">
       <l n="162">The watch was set , the night came , and the men</l>
       <l n="163">Hid from the moon in shadowed nooks to sleep ,</l>
       <l n="164">Bunched like the dead ; still , like the dead , as when</l>
       <l n="165">Plague in a city leaves none even to weep .</l>
       <l n="166">The ship 's track brightened to a mile-broad sweep ;</l>
       <l n="167">The mate there felt her pulse , and eyed the spars :</l>
       <l n="168">South-west by south she staggered under the stars .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="25">
       <l n="169">Down in his bunk the Dauber lay awake</l>
       <l n="170">Thinking of his unfitness for the sea .</l>
       <l n="171">Each failure , each derision , each mistake ,</l>
       <l n="172">There in the life not made for such as he ;</l>
       <l n="173">A morning grim with trouble sure to be ,</l>
       <l n="174">A noon of pain from failure , and a night</l>
       <l n="175">Bitter with men 's contemning and despite .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="26">
       <l n="176">This in the first beginning , the green leaf ,</l>
       <l n="177">Still in the Trades before bad weather fell ;</l>
       <l n="178">What harvest would he reap of hate and grief</l>
       <l n="179">When the loud Horn made every life a hell ?</l>
       <l n="180">When the sick ship lay over , clanging her bell ,</l>
       <l n="181">And no time came for painting or for drawing ,</l>
       <l n="182">But all hands fought , and icy death came clawing ?</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="27">
       <l n="183">Hell , he expected ,— hell . His eyes grew blind ;</l>
       <l n="184">The snoring from his messmates droned and snuffled ,</l>
       <l n="185">And then a gush of pity calmed his mind .</l>
       <l n="186">The cruel torment of his thought was muffled ,</l>
       <l n="187">Without , on deck , an old , old , seaman shuffled ,</l>
       <l n="188">Humming his song , and through the open door</l>
       <l n="189">A moonbeam moved and thrust along the floor .</l>

     <p>In this striking book of verse Mr. Gibson writes of simple , homely folk with touching sympathy . The author 's previous book , “ Daily Bread , ” was heralded far and wide as the book of the year in the field of poetry ; in “ Fires ” are contained many of the same characteristics which distinguished it . The story of a girl whose lover is struck dead by a flying bit of stone ; of a wife who has unusual patience with her husband 's shortcomings ; of a flute player ; of a shop and a shopkeeper ; of a machine and those who feed it — these are the subjects of a number of the separate pieces .</p>
