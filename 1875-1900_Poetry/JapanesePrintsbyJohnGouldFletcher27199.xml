    <head>Preface</head>
    <p n="8">At the earliest period concerning which we have any accurate information , about the sixth century A. D ., Japanese poetry already contained the germ of its later development . The poems of this early date were composed of a first line of five syllables , followed by a second of seven , followed by a third of five , and so on , always ending with a line of seven syllables followed by another of equal number . Thus the whole poem , of whatever length ( a poem of as many as forty-nine lines was scarce , even at that day ) always was composed of an odd number of lines , alternating in length of syllables from five to seven , until the close , which was an extra seven syllable line . Other rules there were none . Rhyme , quantity , accent , stress were disregarded . Two vowels together must never be sounded as a diphthong , and a long vowel counts for two syllables , likewise a final “ n ” , and the consonant “ m ” in some cases .</p>
    <p n="9">This method of writing poetry may seem to the reader to suffer from serious disadvantages . In reality this was not the case . Contrast it for a moment with the undignified welter of undigested and ex parte theories which academic prosodists have tried for three hundred years to foist upon English verse , and it will be seen that the simple Japanese rule has the merit of dignity . The only part of it that we Occidentals could not accept perhaps , with advantage to ourselves , is the peculiarly Oriental insistence on an odd number of syllables for every line and an odd number of lines to every poem . To the Western mind , odd numbers sound incomplete . But to the Chinese ( and Japanese art is mainly a highly-specialized expression of Chinese thought ) , the odd numbers are masculine and hence heavenly ; the even numbers feminine and hence earthy . This idea in itself , the antiquity of which no man can tell , deserves no less than a treatise be written on it . But the place for that treatise is not here .</p>
    <p n="10">To return to our earliest Japanese form . Sooner or later this crystallized into what is called a tanka or short ode . This was always five lines in length , constructed syllabically 5 , 7 , 5 , 7 , 7 , or thirty-one syllables in all . Innumerable numbers of these tanka were written . Gradually , during the feudal period , improvising verses became a pastime in court circles . Some one would utter the first three lines of a tanka and some one else would cap the composition by adding the last two . This division persisted . The first hemistich which was composed of 17 syllables grew to be called the hokku , the second or finishing hemistich of 14 syllables was called ageku . Thus was born the form which is more peculiarly Japanese than any other , and which only they have been able to carry to perfection .</p>
    <p n="11">Composing hokku might , however , have remained a mere game of elaborate literary conceits and double meanings , but for the genius of one man . This was the great Basho [ u ] ( 1644-1694 ) who may be called certainly the greatest epigrammatist of any time . During a life of extreme and voluntary self-denial and wandering , Basho [ u ] contrived to obtain over a thousand disciples , and to found a school of hokku writing which has persisted down to the present day . He reformed the hokku , by introducing into everything he wrote a deep spiritual significance underlying the words . He even went so far as to disregard upon occasion the syllabic rule , and to add extraneous syllables , if thereby he might perfect his statement . He set his face sternly against impromptus , poemes d'occasion , and the like . The number of his works were not large , and even these he perpetually sharpened and polished . His influence persisted for long after his death . A disciple and priest of Zen Buddhism himself , his work is permeated with the feeling of that doctrine .</p>
    <p n="12">Zen Buddhism , as Basho [ u ] practised it , may be called religion under the forms of nature . Everything on earth , from the clouds in the sky to the pebble by the roadside , has some spiritual or ethical significance for us . Blake 's words describe the aim of the Zen Buddhist as well as any one 's :</p>
    <p n="13">“ To see a World in a grain of sand , And a Heaven in a wild flower ; Hold infinity in the palm of your hand , And Eternity in an hour . ”</p>
    <p n="14">Basho [ u ] would have subscribed to this as the sole rule of poetry and imagination . The only difference between the Western and the Eastern mystic is that where one sees the world in the grain of sand and tells you all about it , the other sees and lets his silence imply that he knows its meaning . Or to quote Lao-tzu : “ Those who speak do not know , those who know do not speak . ” It must always be understood that there is an implied continuation to every Japanese hokku . The concluding hemistich , whereby the hokku becomes the tanka , is existent in the writer 's mind , but never uttered .</p>
    <p n="15">Let us take an example . The most famous hokku that Basho [ u ] wrote , might be literally translated thus :</p>
    <p n="16">“ An old pond And the sound of a frog leaping Into the water . ”</p>
    <p n="17">This means nothing to the Western mind . But to the Japanese it means all the beauty of such a life of retirement and contemplation as Basho [ u ] practised . If we permit our minds to supply the detail Basho [ u ] deliberately omitted , we see the mouldering temple enclosure , the sage himself in meditation , the ancient piece of water , and the sound of a frog 's leap — passing vanity — slipping into the silence of eternity . The poem has three meanings . First it is a statement of fact . Second , it is an emotion deduced from that . Third , it is a sort of spiritual allegory . And all this Basho [ u ] has given us in his seventeen syllables .</p>
    <p n="18">All of Basho [ u ]' s poems have these three meanings . Again and again we get a sublime suggestion out of some quite commonplace natural fact . For instance :</p>
    <p n="19">“ On the mountain-road There is no flower more beautiful Than the wild violet . ”</p>
    <p n="20">The wild violet , scentless , growing hidden and neglected among the rocks of the mountain-road , suggested to Basho [ u ] the life of the Buddhist hermit , and thus this poem becomes an exhortation to “ shun the world , if you would be sublime . ”</p>
    <p n="21">I need not give further examples . The reader can now see for himself what the main object of the hokku poetry is , and what it achieved . Its object was some universalized emotion derived from a natural fact . Its achievement was the expression of that emotion in the fewest possible terms . It is therefore necessary , if poetry in the English tongue is ever to attain again to the vitality and strength of its beginnings , that we sit once more at the feet of the Orient and learn from it how little words can express , how sparingly they should be used , and how much is contained in the meanest natural object . Shakespeare , who could close a scene of brooding terror with the words : “ But see , the morn in russet mantle clad , Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastern hill ” was nearer to the oriental spirit than we are . We have lost Shakespeare 's instinct for nature and for fresh individual vision , and we are unwilling to acquire it through self-discipline . If we do not want art to disappear under the froth of shallow egotism , we must learn the lesson Basho [ u ] can teach us .</p>
    <p n="22">That is not to say , that , by taking the letter for the spirit , we should in any way strive to imitate the hokku form . Good hokkus cannot be written in English . The thing we have to follow is not a form , but a spirit . Let us universalize our emotions as much as possible , let us become impersonal as Shakespeare or Basho [ u ] was . Let us not gush about our fine feelings . Let us admit that the highest and noblest feelings are things that cannot be put into words . Therefore let us conceal them behind the words we have chosen . Our definition of poetry would then become that of Edwin Arlington Robinson , that poetry is a language which tells through a reaction upon our emotional natures something which cannot be put into words . Unless we set ourselves seriously to the task of understanding that language is only a means and never an end , poetic art will be dead in fifty years , from a surfeit of superficial cleverness and devitalized realism .</p>
    <p n="23">In the poems that follow I have taken as my subjects certain designs of the so-called Uki-oye ( or Passing World ) school . These prints , made and produced for purely popular consumption by artists who , whatever their genius , were despised by the literati of their time , share at least one characteristic with Japanese poetry , which is , that they exalt the most trivial and commonplace subjects into the universal significance of works of art . And therefore I have chosen them to illustrate my doctrine , which is this : that one must learn to do well small things before doing things great ; that the universe is just as much in the shape of a hand as it is in armies , politics , astronomy , or the exhortations of gospel-mongers ; that style and technique rest on the thing conveyed and not the means of conveyance ; and that though sentiment is a good thing , understanding is a better . As for the poems themselves they are in some cases not Japanese at all , but all illustrate something of the charm I have found in Japanese poetry and art . And if they induce others to seek that charm for themselves , my purpose will have been attained .</p>
