   <p>NOTE : Any one who has read anything of the troubadours knows well the tale of Bertran of Born and My Lady Maent of Montaignac , and knows also the song he made when she would none of him , the song wherein he , seeking to find or make her equal , begs of each preeminent lady of Langue d'Oc some trait or some fair semblance : thus of Cembelins her “ esgart amoros ” to wit , her love-lit glance , of Aelis her speech free-running , of the Vicomptess of Chales her throat and her two hands , at Roacoart of Anhes her hair golden as Iseult 's ; and even in this fashion of Lady Audiart “ although she would that ill come unto him ” he sought and praised the lineaments of the torse . And all this to make “ Una dompna soiseubuda ” a borrowed lady or as the Italians translated it “ Una donna ideale . ”</p>

    <p n="1">NOTE PRECEDENT TO “ LA FRAISNE ”</p>
    <p n="2">“ When the soul is exhausted of fire , then doth the spirit return unto its primal nature and there is upon it a peace great and of the woodland</p>
    <p n="3">“ magna pax et silvestris . ”</p>
    <p n="4">Then becometh it kin to the faun and the dryad , a woodland-dweller amid the rocks and streams</p>
    <p n="5">“ consociis faunis dryadisque inter saxa sylvarum . ” Janus of Basel .<span corresp="#note1_2" type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span></p>
    <p n="6">Also has Mr. Yeats in his “ Celtic Twilight ” treated of such , and I because in such a mood , feeling myself divided between myself corporal and a self aetherial “ a dweller by streams and in woodland , ” eternal because simple in elements</p>
    <p n="7">" Aeternus quia simplex naturae . ”</p>
    <p n="8">Being freed of the weight of a soul “ capable of salvation or damnation , ” a grievous striving thing that after much straining was mercifully taken from me ; as had one passed saying as one in the Book of the Dead ,</p>
    <p n="9">“ I , lo I , am the assembler of souls , ” and had taken it with him leaving me thus simplex naturae , even so at peace and transsentient as a wood pool I made it .</p>
    <p n="10">The Legend thus : “ Miraut de Garzelas , after the pains he bore a-loving Riels of Calidorn and that to none avail , ran mad in the forest .</p>
    <p n="11">“ Yea even as Peire Vidal ran as a wolf for her of Penautier though some say that twas folly or as Garulf Bisclavret so ran truly , till the King brought him respite ( See ‘ Lais ’ Marie de France ) , so was he ever by the Ash Tree . ”</p>
    <p n="12">Hear ye his speaking : ( low , slowly he speaketh it , as one drawn apart , reflecting ) ( egare ) .</p>
    <note xml:id="note1_2" place="bottom" n="1">Referendum for contrast . “ Daemonalitas ” of the Rev . Father Sinistrari of Ameno ( 1600 circ . ) “ A treatise wherein is shown that there are in existence on earth rational creatures besides man , endowed like him with a body and soul , that are born and die like him , redeemed by our Lord Jesus Christ , and capable of receiving salvation or damnation . ” Latin and English text , pub . Liseux , Paris , 1879 .</note>
    <p n="13">NOTES ON NEW POEMS</p>
    <p n="14">VISION OF ITALY .</p>
    <p n="15">1 . “ che lo glorifico . ” In the Piazza dei Signori , you will find an inscription which translates thus :</p>
    <p n="16">“ It is here Can Grande della Scala gave welcome to Dante Alighieri , the same which glorified him , dedicating to him that third his song eternal . ”</p>
    <p n="17">“ C. G . vi accolse D. A . che lo glorifico dedicandogli la terza , delle eterne sue cantiche . ”</p>
    <p n="18">2 . Ref . Richard of St. Victor . “ On the preparation of the soul for contemplation , ” where he distinguishes between cogitation , meditation , and contemplation .</p>
    <p n="19">In cogitation the thought or attention flits aimlessly about the subject .</p>
    <p n="20">In meditation it circles round it , that is , it views it systematically , from all sides , gaining perspective .</p>
    <p n="21">In contemplation it radiates from a centre , that is , as light from the sun it reaches out in an infinite number of ways to things that are related to or dependent on it .</p>
    <p n="22">The words above are my own , as I have not the Benjamin Minor by me .</p>
    <p n="23">Following St. Victor 's figure of radiation : Poetry in its acme is expression from contemplation .</p>
    <p n="24">3 . San Pietro Incarnato . There are several rows of houses intervening between it and the river .</p>
    <p n="25">ALBA BELINGALIS</p>
    <p n="26">MS. in Latin , with refrain ,</p>
    <p n="27">“ L alba par umet mar atras el poy Pas abigil miraclar Tenebris . ”</p>
    <p n="28">It was and may still be the oldest fragment of Provencal known .</p>
    <p n="29">MARVOIL</p>
    <p n="30">The Personae are :</p>
    <p n="31">Arnaut of Marvoil , a troubadour , date 1170-1200 . The Countess ( in her own right ) of Burlatz , and of Beziers , being the wife of The Vicomte of Beziers . Alfonso IV of Aragon . Tibors of Mont-Ausier . For fuller mention of her see the “ razos ” on Bertran of Born . She is contemporary with the other persons , but I have no strict warrant for dragging her name into this particular affair .</p>
    <p n="32">Marco Londonio 's Italian version of “ Nel Biancheggiar ":</p>
    <p n="33">Nel biancheggiar di delicata rosa Risplendono i colori D ’ occidentali fiori Prima che l'alba , in esultanza ascosa</p>
    <p n="34">Voglia baciarli . Ed aleggiar io sento Qual su dolce liuto Nel lor linguaggio muto Fiorir di gioia e tocco di tormento</p>
    <p n="35">Cosi un ’ arcano senso di languore , Le sue sognanti dita Fanno scordar la vita Spirando in verso tutto pien d'amore ....</p>
    <p n="36">Senza morir : che sanno i suoni alati , Vedendo il nostro stato , Ch ’ e dal dolor turbato , Di lasciarci , morendo , desolati .</p>
