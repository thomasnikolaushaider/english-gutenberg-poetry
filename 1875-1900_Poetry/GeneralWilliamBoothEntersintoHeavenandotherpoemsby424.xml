       <l n="9">Minds still passion-ridden , soul-powers frail :—</l>
       <l n="10">Vermin-eaten saints with mouldy breath ,</l>

        <l n="50">But their noise played havoc with the angel-choir .</l>

Over borders we would hurry on Safe by sunrise farms , and springs of dawn , Wash our wounds and jail stains there at last , Azure rivers flowing , flowing past .

     <p>King Arthur 's men have come again . They challenge everywhere The foes of Christ 's Eternal Church . Her incense crowns the air . The heathen knighthood cower and curse To hear the bugles ring , BUT SPEARS ARE SET , THE CHARGE IS ON , WISE ARTHUR SHALL BE KING !</p>
     <p>And Cromwell 's men have come again , I meet them in the street . Stern but in this — no way of thorns Shall snare the children 's feet . The reveling foemen wreak but waste , A sodden poisonous band . FIERCE CROMWELL BUILDS THE FLOWER-BRIGHT TOWNS , AND A MORE SUNLIT LAND !</p>
     <p>And Lincoln 's men have come again . Up from the South he flayed , The grandsons of his foes arise In his own cause arrayed . They rise for freedom and clean laws High laws , that shall endure . OUR GOD ESTABLISHES HIS ARM AND MAKES THE BATTLE SURE !</p>
