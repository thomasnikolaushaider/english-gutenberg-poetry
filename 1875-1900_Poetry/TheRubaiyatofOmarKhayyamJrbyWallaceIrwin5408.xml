    <docImprint>Since the publication of Edward Fitzgerald 's classic translation of the Rubaiyat in<date>1851</date>-  or rather since its general popularity several years later -  poets minor and major have been rendering the sincerest form of flattery to the genius of the Irishman who brought Persia into the best regulated families . Unfortunately there was only one Omar and there were scores of imitators who , in order to make the Astronomer go round , were obliged to draw him out to the thinness of Balzac 's Magic Skin . While all this was going on , the present Editor was forced to conclude that the burning literary need was not for more translators , but for more Omars to translate ; and what was his surprise to note that the work of a later and superior Omar Khayyam was lying undiscovered in the wilds of Borneo ! Here , indeed , was a sensation in the world of letters -  a revelation as thrilling as the disinterment of Ossian 's forgotten songs -  the discovery of an unsubmerged Atlantis . While some stout Cortez more worthy than the Editor might have stood on this new Darien and gazed over the sleeping demesne of Omar Khayyam , Jr ., he had , so to speak , the advantage of being first on the ground , and to him fell the duty , nolens volens , of lifting the rare philosophy out of the Erebus that had so long cloaked it in obscurity . It is still a matter of surprise to the Editor that the discovery of these Rubaiyat should have been left to this late date , when in sentiment and philosophy they have points of superiority over the quatrains of the first Omar of Naishapur . The genius of the East has , indeed , ever been slow to reveal itself in the West . It took a Crusade to bring to our knowledge anything of the schöner Geist of the Orient ; and it was not until the day of Matthew Arnold that the Epic of Persia<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>was brought into the proper realm of English poesy . What wonder , then , that not until the first Omaric madness had passed away were the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam , Jr ., lifted into the light after an infinity of sudor et labor spent in excavating under the 9 , 000 irregular verbs , 80 declensions , and 41 exceptions to every rule which go to make the ancient Mango-Bornese dialect in which the poem was originally written , foremost among the dead languages ! Although little is known of the life of Omar Khayyam the elder , the details of his private career are far more complete than those of his son , Omar Khayyam , Jr . In fact , many historians have been so careless as to have entirely omitted mention of the existence of such a person as the younger Omar . Comparative records of the two languages , however , show plainly how the mantle was handed from the Father to the Son , and how it became the commendable duty of the second generation to correct and improve upon the first . Omar Khayyam died in the early part of the eleventh century , having sold his poems profitably , with the proceeds of which he established taverns throughout the length and breadth of Persia . Omar died in the height of his popularity , but shortly after his death the city of Naishapur became a temperance town . Even yet the younger Omar might have lived and sung at Naishapur had not a fanatical sect of Sufi women , taking advantage of the increasing respectability of the once jovial city , risen in a body against the house of Omar and literally razed it to the ground with the aid of hatchets , which were at that time the peculiar weapon of the sex and sect . It is said that the younger Omar , who was then a youth , was obliged to flee from the wrath of the Good Government Propagandists and to take abode in a distant city . For some time he wandered about Persia in a destitute condition , plying the hereditary trade of tent-maker , but at length poverty compelled him to quit his native country for good and to try his fortunes in a land so remote that the dissolute record of his parent could no longer hound him . Borneo was the island to which the poet fled , and here the historian finds him some years later prospering in the world 's goods and greatly reverenced by the inhabitants . Although Omar , Jr ., was undoubtedly the greatest man that Borneo has yet produced , he must not be confused in the mind of the reader with the Wild Man of Borneo , who , although himself a poet , was a man of far less culture than the author of the present Rubaiyat . While not a Good Templar , the younger Omar showed a commendable tendency toward reform . The sensitive Soul of the poet was ever cankered with the thought that his father 's jovial habits had put him in a false position , and that it was his filial duty to retrieve the family reputation . It was his life work to inculcate into the semi-barbaric minds of the people with whom he had taken abode the thought that the alcoholic pleasures of his father were false joys , and that ( as sung in number VI ) , -</docImprint>
    <epigraph>
     <p>“ There 's Comfort only in the Smoking Car . ” In Tobacco the son found a lasting and comparatively harmless substitute for the Wine , which , none can doubt , caused the elder Omar to complain so bitterly , -  “ Indeed , the Idols I have loved so long Have done my credit in Men 's eyes much wrong . ' ’ Note the cheerfulness with which the Son answers the Father in a stanza which may be taken as a key to his Reformatory Philosophy , “ O foozied Poetasters , fogged with Wine , Who to your Orgies bid the Muses Nine , Go bid them then , but leave to me , the Tenth Whose name is Nicotine , for she is mine ! ' ’ Quite in accordance with his policy of improving on his father 's rakish Muse was the frequent endorsement of the beautiful and harmless practice of kissing . The kiss is mentioned some forty-eight times in the present work , and in the nine hundred untranslated Rubaiyat , two hundred and ten more kisses occur , making a grand total of two hundred and fifty-eight Omaric kisses -  “ Enough ! - of Kisses can there be Enough ? ” It may be truly said that the Father left the discovery of Woman to his Son , for nowhere in the Rubaiyat of Naishapur 's poet is full justice done to the charms of the fair . Even in his most ardent passages old Omar uttered no more than a eulogy to Friendship .</p>
    </epigraph>
    <docImprint>Where the philosophy of the elder Omar was bacchanalian and epicurean , that of the Son was tobacchanalian and eclectic , allowing excess only in moderation , as it were , and countenancing nothing more violent than poetic license . However , we are led to believe that the tastes of his time called for a certain mild sensuality as the gustatio to a feast of reason , and had Omar Khayyam lived in our own day he would doubtless have agreed with a reverend Erlington and Bosworth Professor in the University of<settlement>Cambridge</settlement>who boldly asserts that the literature redolent of nothing but the glories of asceticism “ deserves the credit due to goodness of intention , and nothing else . ” Due doubtless to the preservative influence of smoke Omar Khayyam , Jr ., was enabled to live to the hale age of one hundred and seven , and to go to an apotheosis fully worthy his greatness . Among the native chroniclers the quatrain ( number XCVIII ) -  “ Then let the balmed Tobacco be my Sheath , The ardent Weed above me and beneath , And let me like a living Incense rise , A Fifty-Cent Cigar between my Teeth , ” has been the source of much relentless debate . By some it is held that this stanza is prophetic in its nature , foreseeing the transcendent miracle of the poet 's death ; by others it is as stoutly maintained that the poet in the above lines decreed that his work should be preserved and handed down to posterity in a wrapping of tobacco . The Editor is inclined to the belief that there is much truth in both opinions , for the parchment , when it came to hand , was stained and scented from its wrappings of Virginia and Perique ; and the manner of the poet 's death marks Number XCI as another remarkable instance of the clairvoyance of the Muse . To quote from the quaint words of the native chronicler : -  “ For while the Volcanic Singer was seated one day in the shade of a banyan tree , fresh cigars and abandoned stumps surrounding him like the little hills that climb the mountain , he nodded and fell asleep , still puffing lustily at a panatella , sweet and black . Now the poet 's beard was long and his sleep deep , and as the weed grew shorter with each ecstatic puff , the little brand of fire drew closer and closer to the beautiful hairy mantle that fell from the poet 's chin . That day the Island was wrapped in a light gauze of blue mist , an exotic smoke that was a blessing to the nostrils . It suffused the whole Island from end to end , and reminded the happy inhabitants of the Cigars of Nirvana , grown in some Plantation of the Blessed . When the smoke had passed and our heads were cleared of the narcotic fumes , we hastened to the spot where our good master had loved to sit ; but there naught remained but a great heap of white ashes , sitting among the pipes and cigars that had inspired his song . Thus he died as he lived , an ardent smoker . ” W. I .</docImprint>

    <head>Notes</head>
    <p n="1">I -  “ Sours the Milk of Life ; ” thunderstorms , earthquakes and artificial commotions of the earth are popularly and quasi-scientifically believed to have the effect of turning milk from sweet to sour ; so here the Milk of Life is soured by the sudden advent of the Brat of Death ( Care , perhaps , who is said to have killed a cat on one occasion ) . By some critics it is held that the figure might have been enrichened by the substitution of the Cream of Life for the Milk of Life .</p>
    <p n="2">II- Gorgona is referred to but three times in the present work , in Rubs II , XXI and XXVI . Number II would lead us to believe that the poet used her figuratively as Sorrow or Remorse ; but the text of XXI and XXVI point another conclusion . The latter Rubaiyat tell us forcefully that Gorgona was but too real and that her unloveliness was a sore trial to the fine attunement of the poet 's nerves .</p>
    <p n="3">II -  Such words as “ tobacchanalian ” ( compounded from tobacco and bacchanalian ) Lewis Carrol claimed as his own under the title of “ portmanteau words , ” -  another example of the antiquity of modernity .</p>
    <p n="4">VII -  “ The Early Worm is up to Catch the Fish ; ” the worm , caught as bait , will in turn serve as captor for some luckless fish . This , possibly , is the Bornese version of our own proverb , “ The early bird catches the worm . ”</p>
    <p n="5">IX -  “ The Invisible Buskin at the Gate ” probably refers to the shoe left outside of temples and mosques in the Orient . The temple here meant is doubtless the Temple of Love , and the fact of the Buskin being Invisible illumes the eyes of the damosel who knows that the devotee is worshiping at the Shrine of Love .</p>
    <p n="6">X -  Than Basilisk or Nenuphar ; the poet has given us in two words the dual aspect of Woman ; flowerlike in repose , serpentine in action .</p>
    <p n="7">X -  Pendants ; who has not noted a hairpin in the act of falling , hanging for a moment , as though loth to leave its gentle habitation ? Omar Khayyam , Jr ., was an observer of small things as well as great .</p>
    <p n="8">X -  A Hundred Hairpins ; aspirates are used liberally in this line , probably to give the effect of falling hairpins .</p>
    <p n="9">XIII -  Hymen Spring ; Hymen , while not the god of husbandry , was the accepted deity of marriage ; hence Spring , the incorrigible match-maker , may very , easily be identified with Hymen . Note the pleasing alliteration of the words Hymen and hymning brought so close together .</p>
    <p n="10">XVIII -  Eolian Aloes ; aloes , according to Oscar Wilde in the Picture of Dorian Grey , have the power of banishing melancholy wherever their perfume penetrates . Eolian Aloes may be the exotic melodies that drive care from the mind .</p>
    <p n="11">XXIII -  Forgiviness ; the reader will probably regard this spelling of forgiveness somewhat unusual , and the Editor freely confesses that he has no authority for such usage . But since Fitzgerald has coined enow for the sake of a rhyme , the Editor hopes that he will be forgiven his forgiviness .</p>
    <p n="12">XXIX -  With what an Equanimity ; there is an untranslated quatrain to the effect that ugliness is the only sin that can make a woman ashamed to look her mirror in the face .</p>
    <p n="13">XXV -  The breaking of the glass at the gaze of Gorgona , as well as the squamiest serpent in her locks , mentioned in II , give us a clew as to the derivation of her name from that of the Gorgon , Medusa , whose uncomeliness was so intense as to petrify all that met her gaze . On the other hand , the glance of Gorgona seemed to be rather explosive than congealing .</p>
    <p n="14">XXV -  Torques ; this word ( like squamiest ) is derived directly from the Latin , to be used in this work . They are not properly English words , but the Editor intends they shall become so in the near future .</p>
    <p n="15">XXVI -  Wreathed is used in obsolete English and especially in Spenser , to mean turned or bent .</p>
    <p n="16">XXVII -  Attar-Musk ; attar is the Persian word for druggist , but we hesitate to believe that the poet would attribute an artificial perfume to the rose .</p>
    <p n="17">XXXV -  Myself when young ; this stanza is supposed to be biographical in its intent . It is known that before the anti-Omaric uprising in Naishapur , and even during his errant tour through Persia , the younger Omar was socially lionized ,, becoming much sought after . It may seem improbable that Omar , Jr ., as a member of the sterner sex , should have been admitted as a regular frequenter of women 's clubs , but it must be remembered that then , even as in our own day , men were eagerly prized as lecturers on subjects of interest to women . Omar , Jr ., appeared for several seasons before the women 's clubs of Naishapur , giving recitations and readings from his father 's works .</p>
    <p n="18">XXXVI -  Ibsen -  Boccacio ; for a Persian poet of so remote a date , Omar Khayyam , Jr ., showed a remarkable knowledge of modern as well as mediaeval literature .</p>
    <p n="19">LVII -  That Great Menagerie ; another reference to his experience as a social lion is found here , as in the three rubaiyat following . The gabble garbled garrulousness ( the familiar “ gobble , gabble and git , crystallized into the higher form of expression ) indicates that the narcotic effect of tea on womankind was much the same in Omar 's time as in ours .</p>
    <p n="20">LXI -  Leave to me the Tenth ; the discovery of a tenth Muse puts the younger Omar on an equal footing with his father in science as well as in poetry . The editor has found that upon quitting forever his native Persia , Omar Khayyam , Jr ., brought to Borneo many of the more refined sciences . In his hereditary profession , astronomy , he claims the rare distinction of having first made observations through the medium of a wine-glass . His long fidelity to this method was rewarded by some remarkable results , for his private journals show that on several occasions he was able to discern as many as eight sister satellites swimming in eccentric orbits around the moon -  a discovery which our much-vaunted modern science has never been able to equal or even to approach .</p>
    <p n="21">LXVII -  Her Lips no Questions ask ;</p>
    <p n="22">“ Lips with kissing forfeit no favour ; Nay , they increase as the moon doth ever . ” Boccacio . ( Decameron . )</p>
    <p n="23">LXXI -  The A B C ; this rubái'y , though indescribably beautiful in the Original , is somewhat too involved for us to grasp the meaning at one reading . Perhaps , in thus weaving the alphabet into his numbers , it was the purpose of the poet to give promise of the ultimate attainment of the Alpha and Omega of knowledge . Perhaps the stanza , on the other hand , was merely intended as a pretty poetical conceit , an exercise in metrical ingenuity . If the latter theory holds good , what a pity it would seem that these rubaiyat were not originally written in Chinese , the infinite alphabet of which language would have furnished material for the present work and several revised editions also !</p>
    <p n="24">LXXIII -  While Growing Roses in a Cabbage Lot ; confusing , perhaps at first reading , but here again may the student employ the device of symbolism with great advantage . The Roses may be taken for the flowers of fancy , the Cabbage Lot for the field of sordid reality . As a staple vegetable , the rose can never compete with the Cabbage .</p>
    <p n="25">LXXIV -  He Whistles on his Fingers and his Toes ; there are many who may very justly consider this line as undignified and unrefined ; but such readers should always remember that these quatrains may be taken as purely symbolical . Thus the Fingers and Toes may be regarded as mental aspects and the whistle as whatever best suits the reader .</p>
    <p n="26">LXXXIII -  Asphodel ; the fabled flower of immortality ; also a brand of cigar much favoured by the younger Omar .</p>
    <p n="27">LXXXV -  Anodyne ; some translations have this Iodine .</p>
    <p n="28">XCIII -  The How is swiftly mingling with the When , etc . ; the great questions , How , What and When , are being withdrawn unanswered by the dnulovpec , who is responsible for their propounding .</p>
