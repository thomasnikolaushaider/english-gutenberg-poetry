     <l n="1">My dear Cornwall Hollis :</l>
   </lg>
   <p>With the Allied cause crumbling away it is high time we thought of aesthetics . As a triste jest I said that to you the other day , and your reply was a plea to let you write a preface for a new edition of my forgotten Sonnets from the Patagonian . I am at last persuaded , and who but you should do the preface ?</p>
   <p>With Mitteleuropa a fact it should be apparent to any honest , thinking man that we are losing the War . Perhaps , in a larger sense , we have already lost the War and the dusk of the Anglo-Saxon is come . Then we are at last joined with the Hellenes and Latins in the descending scale , and it is the Teuton now approaching the perihelion , with the Slav , yet to conquer , in the far distance . But that is an eye-survey for eternity , and we have merely to do with the finite present . So we may still think of resistance , and not yet abandon hope of postponing defeat .</p>
   <p>It is now the hour for the supreme test of America , and she too must fail , as our Allies have failed , before the Huns unless somewhere she can find the beauty and the strength of the human soul with which to give battle . For the first time in history it is souls , not guns , that will win the War , and remember , my dear friend , that Beauty is more necessary than food that the soul may live .</p>
   <p>We are all but engulfed in error . We say that we do not hate the German people ; it is the Kaiser we are fighting . A pitiful self-delusion ! It must be the German people we hate as an overshadowing race , if our fight is to have even the excuse of the inflamed passion of the survival of the fittest . We must acknowledge the Kaiser as the symbol of the best organized form of government , unless we are frankly anarchists ; the most efficient , the most powerful , the most nearly approaching a practical socialism . Let us , therefore , start afresh . We hate the German people , for they have threatened our complacent supremacy as lords of the world . Now we are at least truthful .</p>
   <p>Thus far , the Allies have failed signally as a military force . The Europeans have forgotten how to fight , and we in America have never learned . We have put too much faith in materialism , and betrayed the Soul and Beauty . There is more to life than living , and more to an army than arms . The moment is here that demands we scrap the military leaders , as such , and seek stronger . Why not then turn to the Poets to direct the War , for , lo ! it was the Poets who in seven days won the Irish Revolution . None knows better than you how I begrudge giving the ever-turbulent West Britons any praise , any glory , but there is the simple truth . They vanquished the foe because they first had conquered fear , and then nought could stand against them .</p>
   <p>If we could purge ourselves of our fear of Germany we should capture Berlin . Could I enlist a Battalion of Irreproachables , whose uniforms should be walking suit , top hat and pumps , and their only weapon an ebony stick , and sail tomorrow , we should march down Unter den Linden in a month , provided wrapped in our kerchiefs we carried the Gospel of Beauty , and a nonchalance in the knot of our cravats .</p>
   <p>Verily , verily , men are killed solely because they fear death , and turn their backs on Beauty , for only ugliness and error can destroy , and ugliness in the end destroys itself .</p>
   <p>There is really no horror in the War . Even in the ridiculous way we are now fighting it is all a shabby , stupid sham . That chap Griffith gave us a more realistic spectacle in “ The Birth of a Nation . ” Far too few men are actually killed and wounded , and the job is much too large for the materialists . They do not know how to employ effectively the huge forces they have raised into being .</p>
   <p>If somehow we can grope our way back to the springs of Beauty all may yet be saved , but it will require the sacrifice of everything we have . For myriads it will mean the offering of their lives , for that is all they possess , and it must be done freely , gladly , with their souls purified , if it is to avail anything . Pride , ambition , selfishness , self-will must go , or we perish blind miserables .</p>
   <p>For myself , you know I am willingly in service as a common soldier , although some years beyond conscription age . Ungrudgingly I gave up alcohol — almost a lifelong necessity — and for months I , the Epicurean , have been dispassionately measuring the supposed hardships of war that I might truly understand what a soldier has to undergo . With Beauty in the bloodbeat privation is nothing . What can touch me now except the amusing joy of giving up for the common good ? Yet who actually loves humankind less than I ? But the subordination idea intrigues me , possesses me , satisfies me . How better can I prove my patent of snobbery and my innate right cordially to dislike my fellowmen ?</p>
   <p>The social degradation involved in functioning as an enlisted man was and , of course , is the worst of the annoyances . I am neither young enough nor sufficiently democratic to enjoy day after day a below-stairs status . It is a trial , I confess , but I venture to persuade myself that I do all that is required of me with admirable abasement and detachment . Occasionally , indeed , it is capital fun to play the anonymous cipher . I am often urged to obtain a commission . But I cannot quite do that , for would not that be a confession that I had n't the pluck to stick it out ? I must remain as I am . Many of my contemporaries are finding the khaki an easy means of increasing their literary reputations . Wise brothers , ye have chosen your roles . I prefer mine .</p>
   <p>Before you have seen my book through the press I may be dead . With all my heart I hope I shall not come back , for then impersonally I shall have fallen for a cause in which I have no faith . What more distinguished end for an incurable poseur ? Have I not been called that ? Plant , I beg you , mignonette to encircle my arrowroot fields .</p>
   <p>What has all this to do with the Sonnets from the Patagonian ? If you will read my words aright they will give the key to my poems , should you , my beloved Hollis , still lack a key . The volume when it first appeared was not liked by divers nice people — it was thought nasty — but none put it down till he had finished it ; a terror was on him lest he miss a word . And the terror was the Sword of Beauty which slayeth all . Intrepidity ....</p>
   <p>But you shall interpret the poems yourself .</p>

     <l n="1">Forgetting her mauve vows the Fania fled ,</l>
     <l n="2">Taking away her moonlight scarves with her —</l>
     <l n="3">There was no joy left in the calendar ,</l>
     <l n="4">And life was but an orchid that was dead .</l>
     <l n="5">Even our pious peacocks went unfed —</l>
     <l n="6">I had deserved no treachery like this ,</l>

     <l n="12">I sought a shop where shoes were sold within ,</l>
     <l n="13">And for three hundred francs made brave my feet ,</l>
     <l n="14">And then I danced along the boulevard !</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="2">Her hidden smile was full of little breasts ,</l>
     <l n="3">And with her too white hands she stroked her fears ,</l>
     <l n="4">The while the serpent peered at her arched ears ,</l>
     <l n="5">And night 's grim hours stalked in , unbidden guests .</l>
     <l n="6">A noise was in her eyes that sang of scorn ,</l>
     <l n="7">And round her voice there gleamed a nameless dread ,</l>
     <l n="8">As though her lips were hungry for the dead ,</l>
     <l n="9">Yet knew the food of dawn would be forlorn .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="10">The cold hours ebbed , and still she held her throne ;</l>
     <l n="11">Across the sky the lightning made mad play ,</l>
     <l n="12">And then the scarlet screams stood forth revealed .</l>
     <l n="13">She turned her back , and grasped a monotone ;</l>
     <l n="14">It answered all ; she lived again that day</l>
     <l n="15">She triumphed in the tragic turnip field .</l>

     <l n="1">Firenze</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="2">And she was sad since she could not be sad ,</l>
     <l n="3">And every star fled amorous from the sky .</l>
     <l n="4">Her pampered knees fell under her keen eye</l>
     <l n="5">And it came to her she would not go mad .</l>
     <l n="6">The gaucheries were turning the last screw ,</l>
     <l n="7">But there was still the island in the sea ,</l>
     <l n="8">The harridan chorus of eternity ,</l>
     <l n="9">That let her smile because he saw she knew .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="10">She even dared be impudent again ,</l>
     <l n="11">And bit his ear ; the deaths were far away .</l>
     <l n="12">A Black Mass sounded from the treasure vaults —</l>
     <l n="13">She tried to rouge her heart , yet quite in vain .</l>
     <l n="14">The crucifix danced in , beribboned , gay ,</l>
     <l n="15">And lisped to her a wish for the next waltz .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="2">He polished snubs till they were regnant art ,</l>
     <l n="3">Curling their shameless toilets round the hour .</l>
     <l n="4">Each lay upon his lips an exquisite flower</l>
     <l n="5">Subtly malign and poisoned for its part .</l>
     <l n="6">The path of victims was no wanton plan —</l>
     <l n="7">He had bowed his head in sorrow at his birth ,</l>
     <l n="8">For he had said long ere he came to earth</l>
     <l n="9">That it was no place for a gentleman .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="10">But always a heart-scald lurked behind the screen ,</l>
     <l n="11">And somehow he missed the ultimate degrees .</l>
     <l n="12">He saw a beggar at the daylight 's fall</l>
     <l n="13">And then he rose and robbed him for the scene ;</l>
     <l n="14">And when they called him cad he found release —</l>
     <l n="15">He felt he had used the finest snub of all .</l>

     <l n="2">Her voice was fleet-limbed and immaculate ,</l>
     <l n="3">And like peach blossoms blown across the wind</l>
     <l n="4">Her white words made the hour seem cool and kind ,</l>
     <l n="5">Hung with soft dawns that danced a shadow fete .</l>
     <l n="6">A silken silence crept up from the South ,</l>
     <l n="7">The flutes were hushed that mimed the orange moon ,</l>
     <l n="8">And down the willow stream my sighs were strewn ,</l>
     <l n="9">While I knelt to the corners of her mouth .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="10">Lead me afar from clamorous dissonance ,</l>

     <l n="14">And now I seek the garden of the wings</l>
     <l n="15">Where I may bathe in sounds that life destroys .</l>

     <l n="1">Across the rotting pads in the lily lake</l>

     <l n="4">And her gaze followed slowly in its wake .</l>
     <l n="5">Now was the summons come she must obey ,</l>
     <l n="6">For Beauty pleaded from the charnel house ,</l>

     <l n="1">Pittsburgh</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="2">He had hunted for it to the alley 's end ,</l>
     <l n="3">Yet when he found the jade vase he was sad ,</l>
     <l n="4">Low-pulsed with ennui for the praise he had</l>
     <l n="5">Poured into bowls that merely did not offend .</l>
     <l n="6">A wall of glass held back his worshipping ,</l>
     <l n="7">And his eyes that drank this miracle of stone</l>
     <l n="8">Acknowledged the discovery not his own —</l>
     <l n="9">Still the vase was there , and that was everything .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="10">He thought back over all the songs he had sung ,</l>
     <l n="11">And all the hours his heart like waving grain</l>
     <l n="12">Had swayed to music . And the joys now dead</l>
     <l n="13">Seemed haunting coins to meagre beauty flung .</l>
     <l n="14">Poignantly he longed to call them back . In vain !</l>
     <l n="15">But they were the last words that the poet said .</l>

     <l n="1">Wistfully shimmering , shamelessly wise and weak ,</l>
     <l n="2">He lives in pawn , pledging a battered name ;</l>
     <l n="3">He loves his failures as one might love fame ,</l>
     <l n="4">And listens for the ghost years as they speak .</l>
     <l n="5">A fragrance bright and broken clasps his head ,</l>
     <l n="6">And wildwood airs sing a frayed interlude ,</l>
     <l n="7">While cloaked he comes in a new attitude</l>
     <l n="8">To play gravedigger if the word be said .</l>

     <l n="9">He swore he would be glad and only glad ,</l>

     <l n="3">He draws droll figures on the windowpane</l>
     <l n="4">To lure his vagrom fellow souls to Rome .</l>
     <l n="5">There is a potent rancour in the moon ,</l>
     <l n="6">Hunting for those who love him still , three</l>
     <l n="7">Gleam back . But with detached anxiety</l>
     <l n="8">He vows that he will alienate them soon .</l>

     <l n="9">He said that love had but two words , the last</l>

     <l n="12">His strangler 's hands carve prayers for the past —</l>
     <l n="13">And chastely he spends an hour every day</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">The fictive tear he holds in reverence ,</l>
     <l n="2">And studies heady griefs that wash the cheek ;</l>
     <l n="3">It is a dim dominion he must seek ,</l>
     <l n="4">To gain some raiment for his impotence .</l>
     <l n="5">Sorrows are numbered , the sighs have their strings ,</l>
     <l n="6">And barren smiles are trained for tragedy ;</l>
     <l n="7">He ties up parcels of mock gaiety ,</l>
     <l n="8">And labels them with many worshippings .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">Grapes in the grass , and every day a waste</l>
     <l n="10">At scattered sources of lost loveliness ,</l>
     <l n="11">With drunkenness to drain the ruined seats .</l>
     <l n="12">He knows his gems are turned to glassy paste —</l>
     <l n="13">But he thanks God aloof from all distress ,</l>
     <l n="14">For he knows sewers run beneath the city streets .</l>

     <l n="5">His self-betrayal had its tenderness</l>
     <l n="6">And reared an outland refuge for his pride ,</l>

     <l n="12">A prayer lay lest one should misconstrue .</l>
     <l n="13">It was an accident — and he began</l>
     <l n="14">A last profound apology to death .</l>
