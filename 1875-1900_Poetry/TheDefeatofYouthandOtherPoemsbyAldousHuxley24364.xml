      <head>I . UNDER THE TREES .</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">There had been phantoms , pale-remembered shapes</l>
       <l n="2">Of this and this occasion , sisterly</l>
       <l n="3">In their resemblances , each effigy</l>
       <l n="4">Crowned with the same bright hair above the nape 's</l>
       <l n="5">White rounded firmness , and each body alert</l>
       <l n="6">With such swift loveliness , that very rest</l>
       <l n="7">Seemed a poised movement : ... phantoms that impressed</l>
       <l n="8">But a faint influence and could bless or hurt</l>
       <l n="9">No more than dreams . And these ghost things were she ;</l>
       <l n="10">For formless still , without identity ,</l>
       <l n="11">Not one she seemed , not clear , but many and dim .</l>
       <l n="12">One face among the legions of the street ,</l>
       <l n="13">Indifferent mystery , she was for him</l>
       <l n="14">Something still uncreated , incomplete .</l>
      </lg>

       <head>II .</head>
       <lg type="stanza" n="2">
        <l n="15">Bright windy sunshine and the shadow of cloud</l>
        <l n="16">Quicken the heavy summer to new birth</l>
        <l n="17">Of life and motion on the drowsing earth ;</l>
        <l n="18">The huge elms stir , till all the air is loud</l>
        <l n="19">With their awakening from the muffled sleep</l>
        <l n="20">Of long hot days . And on the wavering line</l>
        <l n="21">That marks the alternate ebb of shade and shine ,</l>
        <l n="22">Under the trees , a little group is deep</l>
        <l n="23">In laughing talk . The shadow as it flows</l>
        <l n="24">Across them dims the lustre of a rose ,</l>
        <l n="25">Quenches the bright clear gold of hair , the green</l>
        <l n="26">Of a girl 's dress , and life seems faint . The light</l>
        <l n="27">Swings back , and in the rose a fire is seen ,</l>
        <l n="28">Gold hair 's aflame and green grows emerald bright .</l>

        <l n="29">She leans , and there is laughter in the face</l>
        <l n="30">She turns towards him ; and it seems a door</l>
        <l n="31">Suddenly opened on some desolate place</l>
        <l n="32">With a burst of light and music . What before</l>
        <l n="33">Was hidden shines in loveliness revealed .</l>
        <l n="34">Now first he sees her beautiful , and knows</l>
        <l n="35">That he must love her ; and the doom is sealed</l>
        <l n="36">Of all his happiness and all the woes</l>
        <l n="37">That shall be born of pregnant years hereafter .</l>
        <l n="38">The swift poise of a head , a flutter of laughter —</l>
        <l n="39">And love flows in on him , its vastness pent</l>
        <l n="40">Within his narrow life : the pain it brings ,</l>
        <l n="41">Boundless ; for love is infinite discontent</l>
        <l n="42">With the poor lonely life of transient things .</l>

       <head>IV .</head>
       <lg type="stanza" n="4">
        <l n="43">Men see their god , an immanence divine ,</l>
        <l n="44">Smile through the curve of flesh or moulded clay ,</l>
        <l n="45">In bare ploughed lands that go sloping away</l>
        <l n="46">To meet the sky in one clean exquisite line .</l>
        <l n="47">Out of the short-seen dawns of ecstasy</l>
        <l n="48">They draw new beauty , whence new thoughts are born</l>
        <l n="49">And in their turn conceive , as grains of corn</l>
        <l n="50">Germ and create new life and endlessly</l>
        <l n="51">Shall live creating . Out of earthly seeds</l>
        <l n="52">Springs the aerial flower . One spirit proceeds</l>
        <l n="53">Through change , the same in body and in soul —</l>
        <l n="54">The spirit of life and love that triumphs still</l>
        <l n="55">In its slow struggle towards some far-off goal</l>
        <l n="56">Through lust and death and the bitterness of will .</l>

       <head>V .</head>
       <lg type="stanza" n="5">
        <l n="57">One spirit it is that stirs the fathomless deep</l>
        <l n="58">Of human minds , that shakes the elms in storm ,</l>
        <l n="59">That sings in passionate music , or on warm</l>
        <l n="60">Still evenings bosoms forth the tufted sleep</l>
        <l n="61">Of thistle-seeds that wait a travelling wind .</l>
        <l n="62">One spirit shapes the subtle rhythms of thought</l>
        <l n="63">And the long thundering seas ; the soul is wrought</l>
        <l n="64">Of one stuff with the body — matter and mind</l>
        <l n="65">Woven together in so close a mesh</l>
        <l n="66">That flowers may blossom into a song , that flesh</l>
        <l n="67">May strangely teach the loveliest holiest things</l>
        <l n="68">To watching spirits . Truth is brought to birth</l>
        <l n="69">Not in some vacant heaven : its beauty springs</l>
        <l n="70">From the dear bosom of material earth .</l>

       <head>VI . IN THE HAY-LOFT .</head>
       <lg type="stanza" n="6">
        <l n="71">The darkness in the loft is sweet and warm</l>
        <l n="72">With the stored hay ... darkness intensified</l>
        <l n="73">By one bright shaft that enters through the wide</l>
        <l n="74">Tall doors from under fringes of a storm</l>
        <l n="75">Which makes the doomed sun brighter . On the hay ,</l>
        <l n="76">Perched mountain-high they sit , and silently</l>
        <l n="77">Watch the motes dance and look at the dark sky</l>
        <l n="78">And mark how heartbreakingly far away</l>
        <l n="79">And yet how close and clear the distance seems ,</l>
        <l n="80">While all at hand is cloud — brightness of dreams</l>
        <l n="81">Unrealisable , yet seen so clear ,</l>
        <l n="82">So only just beyond the dark . They wait ,</l>
        <l n="83">Scarce knowing what they wait for , half in fear ;</l>
        <l n="84">Expectance draws the curtain from their fate .</l>

       <lg type="stanza" n="7">
        <l n="85">The silence of the storm weighs heavily</l>
        <l n="86">On their strained spirits : sometimes one will say</l>
        <l n="87">Some trivial thing as though to ward away</l>
        <l n="88">Mysterious powers , that imminently lie</l>
        <l n="89">In wait , with the strong exorcising grace</l>
        <l n="90">Of everyday 's futility . Desire</l>
        <l n="91">Becomes upon a sudden a crystal fire ,</l>
        <l n="92">Defined and hard :— If he could kiss her face ,</l>
        <l n="93">Could kiss her hair ! As if by chance , her hand</l>
        <l n="94">Brushes on his ... Ah , can she understand ?</l>
        <l n="95">Or is she pedestalled above the touch</l>
        <l n="96">Of his desire ? He wonders : dare he seek</l>
        <l n="97">From her that little , that infinitely much ?</l>
        <l n="98">And suddenly she kissed him on the cheek .</l>

       <lg type="stanza" n="8">
        <l n="99">A stronger gust catches the cloud and twists</l>
        <l n="100">A spindle of rifted darkness through its heart ,</l>
        <l n="101">A gash in the damp grey , which , thrust apart ,</l>
        <l n="102">Reveals black depths a moment . Then the mists</l>
        <l n="103">Shut down again ; a white uneasy sea</l>
        <l n="104">Heaves round the climbers and beneath their feet .</l>
        <l n="105">He strains on upwards through the wind and sleet ,</l>
        <l n="106">Poised , or swift moving , or laboriously</l>
        <l n="107">Lifting his weight . And if he should let go ,</l>
        <l n="108">What would he find down there , down there below</l>
        <l n="109">The curtain of the mist ? What would he find</l>
        <l n="110">Beyond the dim and stifling now and here ,</l>
        <l n="111">Beneath the unsettled turmoil of his mind ?</l>
        <l n="112">Oh , there were nameless depths : he shrank with fear .</l>

        <l n="116">And sunlit fields of emerald far below</l>
        <l n="117">That seem alive with inward light . In smoke</l>
        <l n="118">The far horizons fade ; and there is peace</l>
        <l n="119">On everything , a sense of blessed release</l>
        <l n="120">From wilful strife . Like some prophetic cloak</l>
        <l n="121">The spirit of the mountains has descended</l>
        <l n="122">On all the world , and its unrest is ended .</l>
        <l n="123">Even the sea , glimpsed far away , seems still ,</l>
        <l n="124">Hushed to a silver peace its storm and strife .</l>
        <l n="125">Mountains of vision , calm above fate and will ,</l>

        <l n="128">Before the panes , rich but a while ago</l>
        <l n="129">With the charred gold and the red ember-glow</l>
        <l n="130">Of dying sunset . Houses quit the husk</l>
        <l n="131">Of secrecy , which , through the day , returns</l>
        <l n="132">A blank to all enquiry : but at nights</l>
        <l n="133">The cheerfulness of fire and lamp invites</l>
        <l n="134">The darkness inward , curious of what burns</l>
        <l n="135">With such a coloured life when all is dead —</l>
        <l n="136">The daylight world outside , with overhead</l>
        <l n="137">White clouds , and where we walk , the blaze</l>
        <l n="138">Of wet and sunlit streets , shops and the stream</l>
        <l n="139">Of glittering traffic — all that the nights erase ,</l>

      <head>OUT OF THE WINDOW</head>
       <l n="1">In the middle of countries , far from hills and sea ,</l>
       <l n="2">Are the little places one passes by in trains</l>
       <l n="3">And never stops at ; where the skies extend</l>
       <l n="4">Uninterrupted , and the level plains</l>
       <l n="5">Stretch green and yellow and green without an end .</l>
       <l n="6">And behind the glass of their Grand Express</l>

       <l n="8">With nothing to think of , nothing to do ,</l>
       <l n="9">Nothing even to look at — never a “ view ”</l>
       <l n="10">In this damned wilderness .</l>
       <l n="11">But I look out of the window and find</l>
       <l n="12">Much to satisfy the mind .</l>
       <l n="13">Mark how the furrows , formed and wheeled</l>
       <l n="14">In a motion orderly and staid ,</l>
       <l n="15">Sweep , as we pass , across the field</l>
       <l n="16">Like a drilled army on parade .</l>
       <l n="17">And here 's a market-garden , barred</l>
       <l n="18">With stripe on stripe of varied greens ...</l>
       <l n="19">Bright potatoes , flower starred ,</l>
       <l n="20">And the opacous colour of beans .</l>
       <l n="21">Each line deliberately swings</l>
       <l n="22">Towards me , till I see a straight</l>
       <l n="23">Green avenue to the heart of things ,</l>
       <l n="24">The glimpse of a sudden opened gate</l>
       <l n="25">Piercing the adverse walls of fate ...</l>
       <l n="26">A moment only , and then , fast , fast ,</l>
       <l n="27">The gate swings to , the avenue closes ;</l>
       <l n="28">Fate laughs , and once more interposes</l>
       <l n="29">Its barriers .</l>

       <l n="5">Sit and listen to the still</l>
       <l n="6">Small hiss and whisper of green logs</l>
       <l n="7">That burn away , that burn away</l>
       <l n="8">With the sound of a far-off falling stream</l>
       <l n="9">Of threaded water blown to steam ,</l>
       <l n="10">Grey ghost in the mountain world of grey .</l>
       <l n="11">Vapours blue as distance rise</l>
       <l n="12">Between the hissing logs that show</l>
       <l n="13">A glimpse of rosy heat below ;</l>
       <l n="14">And candles watch with tireless eyes</l>
       <l n="15">While we sit drowsing here . I know ,</l>
       <l n="16">Dimly , that there exists a world ,</l>
       <l n="17">That there is time perhaps , and space</l>
       <l n="18">Other and wider than this place ,</l>
       <l n="19">Where at the fireside drowsily curled</l>
       <l n="20">We hear the whisper and watch the flame</l>
       <l n="21">Burn blinkless and inscrutable .</l>
       <l n="22">And then I know those other names</l>
       <l n="23">That through my brain from cell to cell</l>
       <l n="24">Echo — reverberated shout</l>
       <l n="25">Of waiters mournful along corridors :</l>
       <l n="26">But nobody carries the orders out ,</l>
       <l n="27">And the names ( dear friends , your name and yours )</l>
       <l n="28">Evoke no sign . But here I sit</l>
       <l n="29">On the wide hearth , and there are you :</l>
       <l n="30">That is enough and only true .</l>
       <l n="31">The world and the friends that lived in it</l>
       <l n="32">Are shadows : you alone remain</l>
       <l n="33">Real in this drowsing room ,</l>
       <l n="34">Full of the whispers of distant rain</l>
       <l n="35">And candles staring into the gloom .</l>

      <head>SCENES OF THE MIND</head>
       <l n="1">I have run where festival was loud</l>
       <l n="2">With drum and brass among the crowd</l>
       <l n="3">Of panic revellers , whose cries</l>
       <l n="4">Affront the quiet of the skies ;</l>
       <l n="5">Whose dancing lights contract the deep</l>

       <l n="9">In beechen caverns that autumn fills</l>
       <l n="10">With the blue shadowiness of distant hills ;</l>
       <l n="11">Whose luminous grey pillars bear</l>
       <l n="12">The stooping sky : calm is the air ,</l>
       <l n="13">Nor any sound is heard to mar</l>
       <l n="14">That crystal silence — as from far ,</l>
       <l n="15">Far off a man may see</l>

       <l n="19">Strangely content , while in my hands</l>
       <l n="20">I held a wealth of coloured strands ,</l>
       <l n="21">Shimmering plaits of silk and skeins</l>
       <l n="22">Of soft bright wool . Each colour drains</l>
       <l n="23">New life at the lamp 's round pool of gold ;</l>
       <l n="24">Each sinks again when I withhold</l>
       <l n="25">The quickening radiance , to a wan</l>

       <l n="27">Of what it was . And in my mind</l>
       <l n="28">Beauty or sudden love has shined</l>
       <l n="29">And wakened colour in what was dead</l>
       <l n="30">And turned to gold the sullen lead</l>
       <l n="31">Of mean desires and everyday 's</l>
       <l n="32">Poor thoughts and customary ways .</l>
       <l n="33">Sometimes in lands where mountains throw</l>

       <l n="38">I have seen God in the cataract .</l>

       <l n="40">Never at rest , yet still the same ,</l>
       <l n="41">God shows himself . And I have known</l>
       <l n="42">The swift fire frozen into stone ,</l>
       <l n="43">And water frozen changelessly</l>
       <l n="44">Into the death of gems . And I</l>
       <l n="45">Long sitting by the thunderous mill</l>
       <l n="46">Have seen the headlong wheel made still ,</l>
       <l n="47">And in the silence that ensued</l>
       <l n="48">Have known the endless solitude</l>
       <l n="49">Of being dead and utterly nought .</l>
       <l n="50">Inhabitant of mine own thought ,</l>

       <l n="2">I would immortalize these nymphs : so bright</l>
       <l n="3">Their sunlit colouring , so airy light ,</l>
       <l n="4">It floats like drowsing down . Loved I a dream ?</l>
       <l n="5">My doubts , born of oblivious darkness , seem</l>
       <l n="6">A subtle tracery of branches grown</l>
       <l n="7">The tree 's true self — proving that I have known</l>
       <l n="8">No triumph , but the shadow of a rose .</l>
       <l n="9">But think . These nymphs , their loveliness ... suppose</l>
       <l n="10">They bodied forth your senses ’ fabulous thirst ?</l>
       <l n="11">Illusion ! which the blue eyes of the first ,</l>
       <l n="12">As cold and chaste as is the weeping spring ,</l>
       <l n="13">Beget : the other , sighing , passioning ,</l>
       <l n="14">Is she the wind , warm in your fleece at noon ?</l>
       <l n="15">No , through this quiet , when a weary swoon</l>
       <l n="16">Crushes and chokes the latest faint essay</l>
       <l n="17">Of morning , cool against the encroaching day ,</l>
       <l n="18">There is no murmuring water , save the gush</l>
       <l n="19">Of my clear fluted notes ; and in the hush</l>
       <l n="20">Blows never a wind , save that which through my reed</l>
       <l n="21">Puffs out before the rain of notes can speed</l>
       <l n="22">Upon the air , with that calm breath of art</l>
       <l n="23">That mounts the unwrinkled zenith visibly ,</l>
       <l n="24">Where inspiration seeks its native sky .</l>
       <l n="25">You fringes of a calm Sicilian lake ,</l>
       <l n="26">The sun 's own mirror which I love to take ,</l>
       <l n="27">Silent beneath your starry flowers , tell</l>
       <l n="28">How here I cut the hollow rushes , well</l>
       <l n="29">Tamed by my skill , when on the glaucous gold</l>
       <l n="30">Of distant lawns about their fountain cold</l>
       <l n="31">A living whiteness stirs like a lazy wave ;</l>
       <l n="32">And at the first slow notes my panpipes gave</l>
       <l n="33">These flocking swans , these naiads , rather , fly</l>
       <l n="34">Or dive . Noon burns inert and tawny dry ,</l>
       <l n="35">Nor marks how clean that Hymen slipped away</l>
       <l n="36">From me who seek in song the real A .</l>
       <l n="37">Wake , then , to the first ardour and the sight ,</l>
       <l n="38">O lonely faun , of the old fierce white light ,</l>
       <l n="39">With , lilies , one of you for innocence .</l>
       <l n="40">Other than their lips ’ delicate pretence ,</l>
       <l n="41">The light caress that quiets treacherous lovers ,</l>
       <l n="42">My breast , I know not how to tell , discovers</l>
       <l n="43">The bitten print of some immortal 's kiss .</l>
       <l n="44">But hush ! a mystery so great as this</l>
       <l n="45">I dare not tell , save to my double reed ,</l>
       <l n="46">Which , sharer of my every joy and need ,</l>
       <l n="47">Dreams down its cadenced monologues that we</l>
       <l n="48">Falsely confuse the beauties that we see</l>
       <l n="49">With the bright palpable shapes our song creates :</l>
       <l n="50">My flute , as loud as passion modulates ,</l>
       <l n="51">Purges the common dream of flank and breast ,</l>
       <l n="52">Seen through closed eyes and inwardly caressed ,</l>
       <l n="53">Of every empty and monotonous line .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="54">Bloom then , O Syrinx , in thy flight malign ,</l>
       <l n="55">A reed once more beside our trysting-lake .</l>
       <l n="56">Proud of my music , let me often make</l>
       <l n="57">A song of goddesses and see their rape</l>
       <l n="58">Profanely done on many a painted shape .</l>
       <l n="59">So when the grape 's transparent juice I drain ,</l>
       <l n="60">I quell regret for pleasures past and feign</l>
       <l n="61">A new real grape . For holding towards the sky</l>
       <l n="62">The empty skin , I blow it tight and lie</l>
       <l n="63">Dream-drunk till evening , eyeing it .</l>
       <l n="64">Tell o'er</l>
       <l n="65">Remembered joys and plump the grape once more .</l>
       <l n="66">Between the reeds I saw their bodies gleam</l>
       <l n="67">Who cool no mortal fever in the stream</l>
       <l n="68">Crying to the woods the rage of their desire :</l>
       <l n="69">And their bright hair went down in jewelled fire</l>
       <l n="70">Where crystal broke and dazzled shudderingly .</l>
       <l n="71">I check my swift pursuit : for see where lie ,</l>
       <l n="72">Bruised , being twins in love , by languor sweet ,</l>
       <l n="73">Two sleeping girls , clasped at my very feet .</l>
       <l n="74">I seize and run with them , nor part the pair ,</l>
       <l n="75">Breaking this covert of frail petals , where</l>
       <l n="76">Roses drink scent of the sun and our light play</l>
       <l n="77">‘ Mid tumbled flowers shall match the death of day .</l>
       <l n="78">I love that virginal fury — ah , the wild</l>
       <l n="79">Thrill when a maiden body shrinks , defiled ,</l>
       <l n="80">Shuddering like arctic light , from lips that sear</l>
       <l n="81">Its nakedness ... the flesh in secret fear !</l>
       <l n="82">Contagiously through my linked pair it flies</l>
       <l n="83">Where innocence in either , struggling , dies ,</l>
       <l n="84">Wet with fond tears or some less piteous dew .</l>
       <l n="85">Gay in the conquest of these fears , I grew</l>
       <l n="86">So rash that I must needs the sheaf divide</l>
       <l n="87">Of ruffled kisses heaven itself had tied .</l>
       <l n="88">For as I leaned to stifle in the hair</l>
       <l n="89">Of one my passionate laughter ( taking care</l>
       <l n="90">With a stretched finger , that her innocence</l>
       <l n="91">Might stain with her companion 's kindling sense</l>
       <l n="92">To touch the younger little one , who lay</l>
       <l n="93">Child-like unblushing ) my ungrateful prey</l>
       <l n="94">Slips from me , freed by passion 's sudden death ,</l>
       <l n="95">Nor heeds the frenzy of my sobbing breath .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="96">Let it pass ! others of their hair shall twist</l>
       <l n="97">A rope to drag me to those joys I missed .</l>
       <l n="98">See how the ripe pomegranates bursting red</l>
       <l n="99">To quench the thirst of the mumbling bees have bled ;</l>
       <l n="100">So too our blood , kindled by some chance fire ,</l>
       <l n="101">Flows for the swarming legions of desire .</l>
       <l n="102">At evening , when the woodland green turns gold</l>
       <l n="103">And ashen grey , ‘ mid the quenched leaves , behold !</l>
       <l n="104">Red Etna glows , by Venus visited ,</l>
       <l n="105">Walking the lava with her snowy tread</l>
       <l n="106">Whene'er the flames in thunderous slumber die .</l>
       <l n="107">I hold the goddess !</l>

      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="109">But the unthinking soul and body swoon</l>
