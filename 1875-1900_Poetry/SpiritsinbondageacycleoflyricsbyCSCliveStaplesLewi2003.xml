    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Published under the pseudonym , Clive Hamilton , Spirits in Bondage was C. S. Lewis ’ first book . Released in 1919 by Heinemann , it was reprinted in 1984 by Harcourt Brace Jovanovich and included in Lewis ’ 1994 Collected Poems . It is the first of Lewis ’ major published works to enter the public domain in the United States . Readers should be aware that in other countries it may still be under copyright protection .</p>
   <p>Most of the poems appear to have been written between 1915 and 1918 , a period during which Lewis was a student under W. T. Kirkpatrick , a military trainee at Oxford , and a soldier serving in the trenches of World War I . Their outlook varies from Romantic expressions of love for the beauty and simplicity of nature to cynical statements about the presence of evil in this world . In a September 12 , 1918 letter to his friend Arthur Greeves , Lewis said that his book was , “ mainly strung around the idea that I mentioned to you before — that nature is wholly diabolical &amp; malevolent and that God , if he exists , is outside of and in opposition to the cosmic arrangements . ” In his cynical poems , Lewis is dealing with the same questions about evil in nature that Alfred Lord Tennyson explored from a position of troubled faith in “ In Memoriam A. H . ” ( Stanzas 54f ) . In a letter written perhaps to reassure his father , Lewis claimed , “ You know who the God I blaspheme is and that it is not the God that you or I worship , or any other Christian . ”</p>
   <p>Whatever Lewis believed at that time , the attitude in many of these poems is quite different from the attitude he expressed in his many Christian books from the 1930s on . Attempts in movies and on stage plays to portray Lewis as a sheltered professor who knew little about pain until the death of his wife late in life , have to deal not only with the many tragedies he experienced from a boy on , but also with the disturbing issues he faced in many of these early poems .</p>
   <p>Prologue</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">As of old Phoenician men , to the Tin Isles sailing</l>
     <l n="2">Straight against the sunset and the edges of the earth ,</l>
     <l n="3">Chaunted loud above the storm and the strange sea 's wailing ,</l>
     <l n="4">Legends of their people and the land that gave them birth —</l>
     <l n="5">Sang aloud to Baal-Peor , sang unto the horned maiden ,</l>
     <l n="6">Sang how they should come again with the Brethon treasure laden ,</l>
     <l n="7">Sang of all the pride and glory of their hardy enterprise ,</l>
     <l n="8">How they found the outer islands , where the unknown stars arise ;</l>
     <l n="9">And the rowers down below , rowing hard as they could row ,</l>
     <l n="10">Toiling at the stroke and feather through the wet and weary weather ,</l>
     <l n="11">Even they forgot their burden in the measure of a song ,</l>
     <l n="12">And the merchants and the masters and the bondsmen all together ,</l>
     <l n="13">Dreaming of the wondrous islands , brought the gallant ship along ;</l>
     <l n="14">So in mighty deeps alone on the chainless breezes blown</l>
     <l n="15">In my coracle of verses I will sing of lands unknown ,</l>
     <l n="16">Flying from the scarlet city where a Lord that knows no pity ,</l>
     <l n="17">Mocks the broken people praying round his iron throne ,</l>
     <l n="18">Sing about the Hidden Country fresh and full of quiet green .</l>
     <l n="19">Sailing over seas uncharted to a port that none has seen .</l>
    </lg>

    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="26">I am the battle 's filth and strain ,</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="28">I am the sea to smother your breath ,</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="30">I am the fact and the crushing reason</l>
     <l n="31">To thwart your fantasy 's new-born treason .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="32">I am the spider making her net ,</l>

     <l n="34">I am a wolf that follows the sun</l>

     <l n="36">II . French Nocturne ( Monchy-Le-Preux )</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="37">Long leagues on either hand the trenches spread</l>
     <l n="38">And all is still ; now even this gross line</l>
     <l n="39">Drinks in the frosty silences divine</l>
     <l n="40">The pale , green moon is riding overhead .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="41">The jaws of a sacked village , stark and grim ;</l>
     <l n="42">Out on the ridge have swallowed up the sun ,</l>
     <l n="43">And in one angry streak his blood has run</l>
     <l n="44">To left and right along the horizon dim .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="45">There comes a buzzing plane : and now , it seems</l>
     <l n="46">Flies straight into the moon . Lo ! where he steers</l>
     <l n="47">Across the pallid globe and surely nears</l>
     <l n="48">In that white land some harbour of dear dreams !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="49">False mocking fancy ! Once I too could dream ,</l>
     <l n="50">Who now can only see with vulgar eye</l>
     <l n="51">That he 's no nearer to the moon than I</l>
     <l n="52">And she 's a stone that catches the sun 's beam .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="53">What call have I to dream of anything ?</l>
     <l n="54">I am a wolf . Back to the world again ,</l>
     <l n="55">And speech of fellow-brutes that once were men</l>
     <l n="56">Our throats can bark for slaughter : cannot sing .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="57">III . The Satyr</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="58">When the flowery hands of spring</l>
     <l n="59">Forth their woodland riches fling ,</l>
     <l n="60">Through the meadows , through the valleys</l>
     <l n="61">Goes the satyr carolling .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="19">
     <l n="62">From the mountain and the moor ,</l>
     <l n="63">Forest green and ocean shore</l>
     <l n="64">All the faerie kin he rallies</l>
     <l n="65">Making music evermore .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="20">
     <l n="66">See ! the shaggy pelt doth grow</l>
     <l n="67">On his twisted shanks below ,</l>
     <l n="68">And his dreadful feet are cloven</l>
     <l n="69">Though his brow be white as snow —</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="21">
     <l n="70">Though his brow be clear and white</l>
     <l n="71">And beneath it fancies bright ,</l>
     <l n="72">Wisdom and high thoughts are woven</l>
     <l n="73">And the musics of delight ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="22">
     <l n="74">Though his temples too be fair</l>
     <l n="75">Yet two horns are growing there</l>

     <l n="78">Faerie maidens he may meet</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="24">
     <l n="82">IV . Victory</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="25">
     <l n="83">Roland is dead , Cuchulain 's crest is low ,</l>
     <l n="84">The battered war-rear wastes and turns to rust ,</l>
     <l n="85">And Helen 's eyes and Iseult 's lips are dust</l>
     <l n="86">And dust the shoulders and the breasts of snow .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="26">
     <l n="87">The faerie people from our woods are gone ,</l>
     <l n="88">No Dryads have I found in all our trees ,</l>
     <l n="89">No Triton blows his horn about our seas</l>
     <l n="90">And Arthur sleeps far hence in Avalon .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="27">
     <l n="91">The ancient songs they wither as the grass</l>
     <l n="92">And waste as doth a garment waxen old ,</l>
     <l n="93">All poets have been fools who thought to mould</l>
     <l n="94">A monument more durable than brass .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="28">
     <l n="95">For these decay : but not for that decays</l>
     <l n="96">The yearning , high , rebellious spirit of man</l>
     <l n="97">That never rested yet since life began</l>
     <l n="98">From striving with red Nature and her ways .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="29">
     <l n="99">Now in the filth of war , the baresark shout</l>
     <l n="100">Of battle , it is vexed . And yet so oft</l>
     <l n="101">Out of the deeps , of old , it rose aloft</l>
     <l n="102">That they who watch the ages may not doubt .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="30">
     <l n="103">Though often bruised , oft broken by the rod ,</l>
     <l n="104">Yet , like the phoenix , from each fiery bed</l>
     <l n="105">Higher the stricken spirit lifts its head</l>
     <l n="106">And higher-till the beast become a god .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="31">
     <l n="107">V. Irish Nocturne</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="32">
     <l n="108">Now the grey mist comes creeping up</l>
     <l n="109">From the waste ocean 's weedy strand</l>
     <l n="110">And fills the valley , as a cup</l>
     <l n="111">If filled of evil drink in a wizard 's hand ;</l>
     <l n="112">And the trees fade out of sight ,</l>
     <l n="113">Like dreary ghosts unhealthily ,</l>
     <l n="114">Into the damp , pale night ,</l>
     <l n="115">Till you almost think that a clearer eye could see</l>
     <l n="116">Some shape come up of a demon seeking apart</l>
     <l n="117">His meat , as Grendel sought in Harte</l>
     <l n="118">The thanes that sat by the wintry log —</l>
     <l n="119">Grendel or the shadowy mass</l>
     <l n="120">Of Balor , or the man with the face of clay ,</l>
     <l n="121">The grey , grey walker who used to pass</l>
     <l n="122">Over the rock-arch nightly to his prey .</l>
     <l n="123">But here at the dumb , slow stream where the willows hang ,</l>
     <l n="124">With never a wind to blow the mists apart ,</l>
     <l n="125">Bitter and bitter it is for thee . O my heart ,</l>
     <l n="126">Looking upon this land , where poets sang ,</l>
     <l n="127">Thus with the dreary shroud</l>
     <l n="128">Unwholesome , over it spread ,</l>
     <l n="129">And knowing the fog and the cloud</l>
     <l n="130">In her people 's heart and head</l>
     <l n="131">Even as it lies for ever upon her coasts</l>
     <l n="132">Making them dim and dreamy lest her sons should ever arise</l>
     <l n="133">And remember all their boasts ;</l>
     <l n="134">For I know that the colourless skies</l>
     <l n="135">And the blurred horizons breed</l>
     <l n="136">Lonely desire and many words and brooding and never a deed .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="33">
     <l n="137">VI . Spooks</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="34">
     <l n="138">Last night I dreamed that I was come again</l>
     <l n="139">Unto the house where my beloved dwells</l>
     <l n="140">After long years of wandering and pain .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="35">
     <l n="141">And I stood out beneath the drenching rain</l>
     <l n="142">And all the street was bare , and black with night ,</l>
     <l n="143">But in my true love 's house was warmth and light .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="36">
     <l n="144">Yet I could not draw near nor enter in ,</l>
     <l n="145">And long I wondered if some secret sin</l>
     <l n="146">Or old , unhappy anger held me fast ;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="37">
     <l n="147">Till suddenly it came into my head</l>
     <l n="148">That I was killed long since and lying dead —</l>
     <l n="149">Only a homeless wraith that way had passed .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="38">
     <l n="150">So thus I found my true love 's house again</l>
     <l n="151">And stood unseen amid the winter night</l>
     <l n="152">And the lamp burned within , a rosy light ,</l>
     <l n="153">And the wet street was shining in the rain .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="39">
     <l n="154">VII . Apology</l>

     <l n="155">If men should ask , Despoina , why I tell</l>
     <l n="156">Of nothing glad nor noble in my verse</l>
     <l n="157">To lighten hearts beneath this present curse</l>
     <l n="158">And build a heaven of dreams in real hell ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="41">
     <l n="159">Go you to them and speak among them thus :</l>
     <l n="160">“ There were no greater grief than to recall ,</l>
     <l n="161">Down in the rotting grave where the lithe worms crawl ,</l>
     <l n="162">Green fields above that smiled so sweet to us . ”</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="42">
     <l n="163">Is it good to tell old tales of Troynovant</l>
     <l n="164">Or praises of dead heroes , tried and sage ,</l>
     <l n="165">Or sing the queens of unforgotten age ,</l>
     <l n="166">Brynhild and Maeve and virgin Bradamant ?</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="43">
     <l n="167">How should I sing of them ? Can it be good</l>
     <l n="168">To think of glory now , when all is done ,</l>
     <l n="169">And all our labour underneath the sun</l>
     <l n="170">Has brought us this-and not the thing we would ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="44">
     <l n="171">All these were rosy visions of the night ,</l>

     <l n="177">Now cry for all your torment : now curse your hour of birth</l>
     <l n="178">And the fathers who begat you to a portion nothing worth .</l>
     <l n="179">And Thou , my own beloved , for as brave as ere thou art ,</l>
     <l n="180">Bow down thine head , Despoina , clasp thy pale arms over it ,</l>
     <l n="181">Lie low with fast-closed eyelids , clenched teeth , enduring heart ,</l>
     <l n="182">For sorrow on sorrow is coming wherein all flesh has part .</l>
     <l n="183">The sky above is sickening , the clouds of God 's hate cover it ,</l>
     <l n="184">Body and soul shall suffer beyond all word or thought ,</l>
     <l n="185">Till the pain and noisy terror that these first years have wrought</l>
     <l n="186">Seem but the soft arising and prelude of the storm</l>
     <l n="187">That fiercer still and heavier with sharper lightnings fraught</l>
     <l n="188">Shall pour red wrath upon us over a world deform .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="47">
     <l n="189">Thrice happy , O Despoina , were the men who were alive</l>
     <l n="190">In the great age and the golden age when still the cycle ran</l>
     <l n="191">On upward curve and easily , for them both maid and man</l>
     <l n="192">And beast and tree and spirit in the green earth could thrive .</l>
     <l n="193">But now one age is ending , and God calls home the stars</l>
     <l n="194">And looses the wheel of the ages and sends it spinning back</l>
     <l n="195">Amid the death of nations , and points a downward track ,</l>
     <l n="196">And madness is come over us and great and little wars .</l>
     <l n="197">He has not left one valley , one isle of fresh and green</l>
     <l n="198">Where old friends could forgather amid the howling wreck .</l>
     <l n="199">It 's vainly we are praying . We cannot , cannot check</l>
     <l n="200">The Power who slays and puts aside the beauty that has been .</l>
