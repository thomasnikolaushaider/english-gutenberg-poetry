     <l n="3">The greater part of this poem was delivered before the Harvard</l>

     <lg type="stanza" n="6">
      <l n="12">Celia was laughing . Hopefully I said :</l>
      <l n="13">“ How shall this beauty that we share ,</l>
      <l n="14">This love , remain aware</l>
      <l n="15">Beyond our happy breathing of the air ?</l>
      <l n="16">How shall it be fulfilled and perfected ?...</l>
      <l n="17">If you were dead ,</l>
      <l n="18">How then should I be comforted ? ”</l>
      <l n="19">But Celia knew instead :</l>
      <l n="20">“ He who finds beauty here , shall find it there . ”</l>
      <l n="21">A halo gathered round her hair .</l>
      <l n="22">I looked and saw her wisdom bare</l>
      <l n="23">The living bosom of the countless dead .</l>
      <l n="24">... And there</l>
      <l n="25">I laid my head .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="7">
      <l n="26">Again when Celia laughed , I doubted her and said :</l>
      <l n="27">“ Life must be led</l>
      <l n="28">In many ways more difficult to see</l>
      <l n="29">Than this immediate way</l>
      <l n="30">For you and me .</l>
      <l n="31">We stand together on our lake 's edge , and the mystery</l>
      <l n="32">Of love has made us one , as day is made of night and night of day .</l>
      <l n="33">Aware of one identity</l>
      <l n="34">Within each other , we can say :</l>
      <l n="35">‘ I shall be everything you are . ’ ...</l>
      <l n="36">We are uplifted till we touch a star .</l>
      <l n="37">We know that overhead</l>
      <l n="38">Is nothing more austere , more starry , or more deep to understand</l>
      <l n="39">Than is our union , human hand in hand .</l>
      <l n="40">.... But over our lake come strangers — a crowded launch , a lonely sailing boy .</l>
      <l n="41">A mile away a train bends by . In every car</l>
      <l n="42">Strangers are travelling , each with particular</l>
      <l n="43">And unkind preference like ours , with privacy</l>
      <l n="44">Of understanding , with especial joy</l>
      <l n="45">Like ours . Celia , Celia , why should there be</l>
      <l n="46">Distrust between ourselves and them , disunity ?</l>
      <l n="47">.... How careful we have been</l>
      <l n="48">To trim this little circle that we tread ,</l>
      <l n="49">To set a bar</l>
      <l n="50">To strangers and forbid them !— Are they not as we ,</l>
      <l n="51">Our very likeness and our nearest kin ?</l>
      <l n="52">How can we shut them out and let stars in ? ”</l>
      <l n="53">She looked along the lake . And when I heard her speak ,</l>
      <l n="54">The sun fell on the boy 's white sail and her white cheek .</l>
      <l n="55">“ I touch them all through you , ” she said . “ I cannot know them now</l>
      <l n="56">Deeply and truly as my very own , except through you ,</l>
      <l n="57">Except through one or two</l>
      <l n="58">Interpreters .</l>
      <l n="59">But not a moment stirs</l>
      <l n="60">Here between us , binding and interweaving us ,</l>
      <l n="61">That does not bind these others to our care . ”</l>
      <l n="62">The sunlight fell in glory on her hair ....</l>
      <l n="63">And then said Celia , radiant , when I held her near :</l>
      <l n="64">“ They who find beauty there , shall find it here . ”</l>
      <l n="65">And on her brow ,</l>
      <l n="66">When I heard Celia speak ,</l>
      <l n="67">Cities were populous</l>
      <l n="68">With peace and oceans echoed glories in her ear</l>
      <l n="69">And from her risen thought</l>
      <l n="70">Her lips had brought ,</l>
      <l n="71">As from some peak</l>
      <l n="72">Down through the clouds , a mountain-air</l>
      <l n="73">To guide the lonely and uplift the weak .</l>
      <l n="74">“ Record it all , ” she told me , “ more than merely this ,</l>
      <l n="75">More than the shine of sunset on our heads , more than a kiss ,</l>
      <l n="76">More than our rapt agreement and delight</l>
      <l n="77">Watching the mountain mingle with the night ....</l>
      <l n="78">Tell that the love of two incurs</l>
      <l n="79">The love of multitudes , makes way</l>
      <l n="80">And welcome for them , as a solitary star</l>
      <l n="81">Brings on the great array .</l>
      <l n="82">Go make a lovers ’ calendar , ”</l>
      <l n="83">She said , “ for every day . ”</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="8">
      <l n="84">And when the sun had put away</l>
      <l n="85">His dazzle , over the shadowy firs</l>
      <l n="86">The solitary star came out .... So on some night</l>
      <l n="87">To eyes of youth shall come my light</l>
      <l n="88">And hers .</l>

     <lg type="stanza" n="9">
      <l n="89">“ Where are you bound , O solemn voyager ? ”</l>
      <l n="90">She laughed one day and asked me in her mirth :</l>
      <l n="91">“ Where are you from ?</l>
      <l n="92">Why are you come ? ”</l>
      <l n="93">.... The questions beat like tapping of a drum ;</l>
      <l n="94">And how could I be dumb ,</l>
      <l n="95">I who have bugles in me ? Fast</l>
      <l n="96">The answer blew to her ,</l>
      <l n="97">For all my breath was worth ....</l>
      <l n="98">“ As a bird comes by grace of spring ,</l>
      <l n="99">You are my journey and my wing —</l>
      <l n="100">And into your heart , O Celia ,</l>
      <l n="101">My heart has flown , to sing</l>
      <l n="102">Solemn and long</l>
      <l n="103">A most undaunted song . ”</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="10">
      <l n="104">This was the song that she herself had taught me how to sing :</l>
      <l n="105">.... As immigrants come toward America</l>
      <l n="106">On their continual ships out of the past ,</l>
      <l n="107">So on my ship America have I , by birth ,</l>
      <l n="108">Come forth at last</l>
      <l n="109">From all the bitter corners of the earth .</l>
      <l n="110">And I have ears to hear the westward wind blowing</l>
      <l n="111">And I have eyes to look beyond the scope Of sea</l>
      <l n="112">And I have hands to touch the hands</l>
      <l n="113">Of shipmates who are going</l>
      <l n="114">Wherever I go and the grace of knowing</l>
      <l n="115">That what for them is hope</l>
      <l n="116">Is hope for me .</l>
      <l n="117">I come from many times and many lands ,</l>
      <l n="118">I look toward life and all that it shall hold ,</l>
      <l n="119">Past bound and past divide .</l>
      <l n="120">And I shall be consoled</l>
      <l n="121">By a continent as wide</l>
      <l n="122">As the round invisible sky .</l>
      <l n="123">.... “ The unseen shall become the seen ....</l>
      <l n="124">O Celia , be my Spanish Queen !</l>
      <l n="125">The Genoan am I ! ”</l>
      <l n="126">And Celia cried :</l>
      <l n="127">“ My jewels , they are yours ,</l>
      <l n="128">Yours for the journey . Use them well .</l>
      <l n="129">Go find the new world , win the shores</l>
      <l n="130">Of which the old books tell !</l>
      <l n="131">.... Yet will they listen , poet ? Will they sail with you ?</l>
      <l n="132">Will they not call you dreamer of a dream ?</l>
      <l n="133">Will they not laugh at you , because you seem</l>
      <l n="134">Concerned with words that people often say</l>
      <l n="135">And deeds they never do ? ”</l>
      <l n="136">The bright sails of my caravel shook seaward in reply :</l>
      <l n="137">“ Though I be told</l>
      <l n="138">A thousand facts to hold</l>
      <l n="139">Me back , though the old boundary</l>
      <l n="140">Rise up like hatred in my way ,</l>
      <l n="141">Though fellow-voyagers cry ,</l>
      <l n="142">‘ A lie ! ’ —</l>
      <l n="143">Here as I come with heaven at my side</l>
      <l n="144">None of the weary words they say</l>
      <l n="145">Remain with me ,</l>
      <l n="146">I am borne like a wave of the sea</l>
      <l n="147">Toward worlds to be ....</l>
      <l n="148">And , young and bold ,</l>
      <l n="149">I am happier than they —</l>
      <l n="150">The timid unbelievers who grow old ! ”</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="11">
      <l n="151">She interceded : “ How impatient , how unkind</l>
      <l n="152">You are ! What secret do you know</l>
      <l n="153">To keep you young ?</l>
      <l n="154">Age comes with keen and accurate advance</l>
      <l n="155">Against youth 's lightly handled lance .</l>
      <l n="156">Age is an ancient despot that has wrung</l>
      <l n="157">All hearts . ” ... My answer was the song forever sung :</l>
      <l n="158">“ This that I need to know I know —</l>
      <l n="159">Onpouring and perpetual immigrants ,</l>
      <l n="160">We join a fellowship beyond America</l>
      <l n="161">Yet in America ....</l>
      <l n="162">Beyond the touch of age , my Celia ,</l>
      <l n="163">In you , in me , in everyone , we join God 's growing mind .</l>
      <l n="164">For in no separate place or time , or soul , we find</l>
      <l n="165">Our meaning . In one mingled soul reside</l>
      <l n="166">All times and places . On a tide</l>
      <l n="167">Of mist and azure air</l>
      <l n="168">We journey toward that soul , through circumstance ,</l>
      <l n="169">Until at last we fully care and dare</l>
      <l n="170">To make within ourselves divinity . ”</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="12">
      <l n="171">“ And what of all the others , ” Celia said ,</l>
      <l n="172">“ Who ventured brave as you ? What of the dead ? ”</l>
      <l n="173">Again I saw the halo in her hair</l>
      <l n="174">And said : “ The dead sail forward , hid behind</l>
      <l n="175">This wave that we ourselves must mount to find</l>
      <l n="176">The eternal way .</l>
      <l n="177">Adventurers of long ago</l>
      <l n="178">Seeking a richer gain than earthy gold ,</l>
      <l n="179">They have left for us , half-told ,</l>
      <l n="180">Their guesses of the port , more numerous and blind</l>
      <l n="181">Than their unnumbered and forgotten faces .</l>
      <l n="182">... And though today , as then ,</l>
      <l n="183">Death is a wind blowing them forward out of sight and out of mind ,</l>
      <l n="184">Yet in familiar and in unfamiliar places</l>
      <l n="185">Inquiring by what means I may</l>
      <l n="186">The destination of the wind</l>
      <l n="187">Of death , I have found signs and traces</l>
      <l n="188">Of the way they go</l>
      <l n="189">And with a quicker heart I have beheld again</l>
      <l n="190">In visions , from my ship at sea ,</l>
      <l n="191">The great new world confronting me ,</l>
      <l n="192">Where , yesterday ,</l>
      <l n="193">Today , tomorrow , dwell my countrymen . ”</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="13">
      <l n="194">And then I looked away ,</l>
      <l n="195">Over the pasture and the valley , to the New Hampshire town ....</l>
      <l n="196">And my heart 's acclaim went down ,</l>
      <l n="197">To Florida , Wisconsin , California ,</l>
      <l n="198">And brought a good report to Celia :</l>
      <l n="199">“ My ship America ,</l>

      <l n="201">Well captained and well manned ,</l>

      <l n="203">Of time , carrying me</l>
      <l n="204">And many passengers .</l>
      <l n="205">And every cabin stirs</l>
      <l n="206">With the pulsing of its engine over the sway of time ,</l>
      <l n="207">Yes , every state and city , every village , every farm ,</l>

     <lg type="stanza" n="14">
      <l n="215">“ Why make your ship so small ?</l>
      <l n="216">Can your America contain them all ? ”</l>
      <l n="217">How wisely I replied</l>
      <l n="218">In the province of my pride :</l>
      <l n="219">“ But these are my own shipmates , these</l>

      <l n="225">At hand — these are my company . ”</l>
      <l n="226">“ What have you said , ” she cried ,</l>
      <l n="227">“ Thinking you knew ?</l>
      <l n="228">Whom have you called your shipmates ? You were wrong !</l>
      <l n="229">Your ship is strong</l>
      <l n="230">With a more various crew</l>
      <l n="231">Than any one man 's country could provide ,</l>
      <l n="232">To make it ride</l>
      <l n="233">So high and manifold and so complete .</l>
      <l n="234">This is the engine-beat</l>

      <l n="236">There is no other ship among the stars than this .</l>
      <l n="237">The wind of death is a bright kiss</l>

      <l n="244">Immigrants all , one ship we ride ,</l>
      <l n="245">Man and his bride</l>
