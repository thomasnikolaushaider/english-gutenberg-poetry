    <head>NOTE</head>
    <p n="1">This book ought to be called Loot or Plunder or Pieces of Eight or Treasure-Trove , or some name which would indicate and get away from its source , for although everything in it can be referred to the Irish of from one hundred to three hundred years ago the word translation would be a misdescription . There are really only two translations in it , Keating 's “ O Woman full of Wiliness ” and Raftery 's “ County Mayo . ” Some of the poems owe no more than a phrase , a line , half a line , to the Irish , and around these scraps I have blown a bubble of verse and made my poem . In other cases , where the matter of the poem is almost entirely taken from the Irish , I have yet followed my own instinct in the arrangement of it , and the result might be called new poems . My first idea was to make an anthology of people whom long ago our poets had praised , so that , in another language and another time , these honoured names might be heard again , even though in my own terms and not in the historic context . I did not pursue this course , for I could not control the material which came to me and which took no heed of my plan and was just as interesting . It would therefore be a mistake to consider that these verses are representative of the poets by whom they are inspired . In the case of David O'Bruadair this is less true than in any of the others , but , even in his case , although I have often conveyed his matter almost verbatim , the selection is not representative of the poet . One side only , and that the least , is shown , for a greater pen than mine would be necessary if that tornado of rage , eloquence , and humour were to be presented ; but the poems which I give might almost be taken as translations of one side of his terrific muse .</p>
    <p n="2">As regards Egan O'Rahilly a similar remark is necessary . No pen and no language but his own could even distantly indicate a skill and melody which might be spoken of as one of the wonders of the world . I have done exactly as I pleased with his material .</p>
    <p n="3">From Antoine O'Raftery I have taken more than from any of the others , and have in nearly every instance treated his matter so familiarly that a lover of Raftery ( and who , having read a verse of his , does not love him ? ) might not know I was indebted to this poet for my songs . His work is different from that of Keating , O'Rahilly , or O'Bruadair , for these were learned men , and were writing out of a tradition so hoary with age and so complicated in convention that only learned and subtle minds could attempt it . I have wondered would Keating or O'Rahilly have been very scornful of Raftery 's work ? I think they might have been angry at such an ignorance of all the rules , and would probably have torn the paper on which his poems were written , and sat down to compose a satire which would have raised blisters on that poor , blind , wandering singer , the master of them all .</p>
    <p n="4">In two of the poems which I tried to translate from Raftery I have completely failed . Against one of them I broke an hundred pens in vain ; and in the other , “ The County Mayo , ” I have been so close to success and so far from succeeding that I may mourn a little about it . The first three verses are not bad , but the last verse is the completest miss : the simplicity of the original is there , its music is not , and in the last two lines the poignance , which should come on the reader as though a hand gripped at his heart , is absent . The other failure I have not printed because I could get no way on it at all : it would not even begin to translate . This is Raftery 's reply to the man who did not recognise him as he fiddled to a crowd , and asked “ who is the musician ? ”</p>
    <p n="5">I am Raftery the poet , Full of hope and love , My eyes without sight , My mind without torment ,</p>
    <p n="6">Going west on my journey By the light of my heart , Tired and weary To the end of the road .</p>
    <p n="7">Behold me now With my back to a wall , Playing music To empty pockets .</p>
    <p n="8">See Douglas Hyde 's Life of Raftery .</p>
    <p n="9">Dissimilar as these poets are from each other in time , education , and temperament , they are alike in that they were all poor men , so poor that there was often little difference between them and beggars . They all sing of their poverty : Keating as a fact to be recorded among other facts , O'Rahilly in a very stately and bitter complaint , and Raftery as in the quotation above ; but O'Bruadair lets out of him an unending , rebellious bawl which would be the most desolating utterance ever made by man if it was not also the most gleeful .</p>
