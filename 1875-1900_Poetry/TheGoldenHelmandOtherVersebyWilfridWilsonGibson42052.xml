      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">Through skies blown clear by storm , o'er stormhYpppHeNspent seas ,</l>
       <l n="2">Day kindled pale with promise of full noon</l>
       <l n="3">Of blue unclouded ; no night-weary wind</l>
       <l n="4">Ruffled the slumberous , heaving deeps to white ,</l>
       <l n="5">Though round the Farne Isles the waves never sink</l>
       <l n="6">In foamless sleep — about the pillared crags</l>
       <l n="7">For ever circling with unresting spray .</l>
       <l n="8">At dawn 's first glimmer , from his island-cell —</l>
       <l n="9">Rock-hewn , secure from tempest — Oswald came</l>
       <l n="10">With slow and weary step , white-faced and worn</l>
       <l n="11">With night-long vigil for storm-perilled souls .</l>
       <l n="12">His anxious eye with sharp foreboding bright —</l>
       <l n="13">He scanned the treacherous flood ; the long froth-trail</l>
       <l n="14">That marks the lurking reefs ; the jag-toothed chasms</l>
       <l n="15">Which , foaming , gape at night beneath the keel —</l>
       <l n="16">The mouth of hell to storm-bewildered ships :</l>
       <l n="17">But no scar-stranded vessel met his glance .</l>
       <l n="18">Relieved , he drank the glistering calm of morn ,</l>
       <l n="19">With nostril keen and warm lips parted wide ;</l>
       <l n="20">While , gradually , the sun-enkindled air</l>
       <l n="21">Quickened his pallid cheek with youthful flame ,</l>
       <l n="22">Though lonely years had silvered his dark head ,</l>
       <l n="23">And round his eyes had woven shadow-meshes .</l>
       <l n="24">Clearly he caught the ever-clamorous cries</l>
       <l n="25">Of guillemot and puffin from afar ,</l>
       <l n="26">Where , canopied by hovering , white wings ,</l>
       <l n="27">They crowded naked pinnacles of rock .</l>
       <l n="28">He watched , with eyes of glistening tenderness ,</l>
       <l n="29">The brooding eider — Cuthbert 's sacred bird ,</l>
       <l n="30">That bears among the isles his saintly name —</l>
       <l n="31">Breast the calm waves ; a black , wet-gleaming fin</l>
       <l n="32">Cleft the blue waters with a foaming jag ,</l>
       <l n="33">Where , close behind the restless herring-herd ,</l>
       <l n="34">With ravening maw of death , the porpoise sped .</l>
       <l n="35">Oswald , light-tranced , dreamed in the sun awhile ;</l>
       <l n="36">Till , suddenly , as some old sorrow starts ,</l>
       <l n="37">Though years have glided by with soothing lull ,</l>
       <l n="38">The gust of ancient longing rent his bliss :</l>
       <l n="39">His narrow isle , as by some darkling spell ,</l>
       <l n="40">More narrow shrank ; the gulls ’ unceasing cries</l>
       <l n="41">Grew still more fretful ; and his hermit-life</l>
       <l n="42">A sea-scourged desolation to him seemed .</l>
       <l n="43">The holy tree of peace — which he had dreamt</l>
       <l n="44">Would flourish in the wilderness afresh ,</l>
       <l n="45">Upspringing ever in new ecstasy</l>
       <l n="46">Of branching beauty and white blooms of truth ,</l>
       <l n="47">Till its star-tangling crest should cleave the sky ,</l>
       <l n="48">And angels rustle through its topmost boughs —</l>
       <l n="49">Seemed sapless , rootless . Through his quivering limbs</l>
       <l n="50">His famine-wasted youth to life upleapt</l>
       <l n="51">With passionate yearning for humanity :</l>
       <l n="52">The stir of towns ; the jostling of glad throngs ;</l>
       <l n="53">Welcoming faces and warm-clasping hands ;</l>
       <l n="54">Yea , even for the lips and eyes of Love</l>
       <l n="55">He hungered with keen pangs of old desire :</l>
       <l n="56">And , if for him these might not be , he craved</l>
       <l n="57">At least the exultation of swift peril —</l>
       <l n="58">The red-foamed riot of delirious strife</l>
       <l n="59">That rears a bloody crest o'er peaceful shires ,</l>
       <l n="60">And , slaying , in a swirl of slaughter dies .</l>
       <l n="61">With brow uplifted and strained , pulsing throat ,</l>
       <l n="62">And salt-parched lips out-thrust , unto the sun</l>
       <l n="63">He stretched beseeching hands , as though he sought</l>
       <l n="64">To snatch some glittering disaster thence .</l>
       <l n="65">One moment radiant thus ; and then once more</l>
       <l n="66">His arms dropped listless , and he slowly shrank</l>
       <l n="67">Within his sea-stained habit , cowering dark</l>
       <l n="68">Amid the azure blaze of sea and sky .</l>
       <l n="69">Then , stirring , with impatient step he moved</l>
       <l n="70">Across the isle to where the rocky shore ,</l>
       <l n="71">Forming a little , crag-encircled bay ,</l>
       <l n="72">Sloped steeply to the level of the sea ;</l>
       <l n="73">But , as he neared the edges of the tide ,</l>
       <l n="74">Startled , he paused , as , marvelling , he saw</l>
       <l n="75">A woman on the shelving , wet , black rock ,</l>
       <l n="76">Lying , forlorn , among the storm-wrack , white</l>
       <l n="77">And motionless ; still wet , her raiment clung</l>
       <l n="78">About her limbs , and with her wet , gold hair</l>
       <l n="79">Green sea-weed tangled . Oswald on her looked</l>
       <l n="80">Amazed , as one who , in a sea-born trance ,</l>
       <l n="81">Discovers the lone spirit of the storm ,</l>
       <l n="82">Self-spent at last , and sunk in dreamless slumber</l>
       <l n="83">Within some caverned gloom . Coldly he watched</l>
       <l n="84">The little waves creep up the glistening rock ,</l>
       <l n="85">And , faltering , slide once more into the deep ,</l>
       <l n="86">As though they feared to waken her : at length ,</l>
       <l n="87">When one , more venturous , about her stole ,</l>
       <l n="88">And moved her heavy hair as if with life ,</l>
       <l n="89">He shuddered ; and a lightning-knowledge struck</l>
       <l n="90">His heart with fear ; and in a flash he knew</l>
       <l n="91">That no sea-phantom couched before him lay ,</l>
       <l n="92">But some frail fellow-creature , tempest-tost ,</l>
       <l n="93">Hung yet in peril on the edge of death ,</l>
       <l n="94">Her weak life slipping from the saving grasp</l>
       <l n="95">While he delayed . He sprang through plashy weed ,</l>
       <l n="96">O'er slippery ridges , to the rock whereon</l>
       <l n="97">She lay with upturned face and close-shut eyes —</l>
       <l n="98">One hand across her breast , the other dipped</l>
       <l n="99">Within a shallow pool of emerald water ,</l>
       <l n="100">With blue-veined fingers clutching the red fronds</l>
       <l n="101">Of frail sea-weed . Then Oswald , bending , felt</l>
       <l n="102">Upon his cheek the feeble breath that still</l>
       <l n="103">Fluttered between the pallid , parted lips .</l>
       <l n="104">In trembling haste , he loosed the sodden cords</l>
       <l n="105">That bound her to a spar ; and with hot hands</l>
       <l n="106">He chafed her icy limbs , until the glow</l>
       <l n="107">Of life returned . With fitful quivering</l>
       <l n="108">The white lids opened ; and she looked on him</l>
       <l n="109">With dull , unwondering eyes whose deep-sea blue</l>
       <l n="110">The gloom of death 's late passing shadowed yet ;</l>
       <l n="111">When suddenly light thrilled them , and bright fear</l>
       <l n="112">Flashed from their depths , and , with a little gasp ,</l>
       <l n="113">She strove to rise ; but Oswald with quick words</l>
       <l n="114">Calmed her weak terror , and she sank once more ,</l>
       <l n="115">Closing her eyes ; and , gently lifting her</l>
       <l n="116">Within his arms — her gold hair hanging straight</l>
       <l n="117">And heavy with sea-water , as he plunged</l>
       <l n="118">Knee-deep through pools of crackling bladder-weed —</l>
       <l n="119">He bore her , unresisting , o'er the isle</l>
       <l n="120">Unto the rock-built shelter he had reared ,</l>
       <l n="121">Some little way apart from his own cell ,</l>
       <l n="122">For storm-stayed fishers or wrecked mariners .</l>
       <l n="123">He laid her on a bed of withered bents ,</l>
       <l n="124">And ministered to her with gentle hands</l>
       <l n="125">And ceaseless care ; till , wrapped in warm , deep sleep ,</l>
       <l n="126">She sank oblivious . Silently he placed</l>
       <l n="127">His island-fare beside her on the board ,</l>
       <l n="128">Lest she should wake in need ; then , with hushed step ,</l>
       <l n="129">He turned to go ; but , ere he reached the door ,</l>
       <l n="130">He paused , and looked again towards the bed ,</l>
       <l n="131">As though he feared his strange sea-guest might flee</l>
       <l n="132">Like some wild spirit , born of wondering foam ,</l>
       <l n="133">That wins from man the shelter of his breast ,</l>
       <l n="134">Then , on a night of moon-enchanted tides ,</l>
       <l n="135">Leaps with shrill laughter to its native seas ,</l>
       <l n="136">Bearing his soul within its glistening arms ,</l>
       <l n="137">To drown his peace on earth and hope of heaven</l>
       <l n="138">In cold eternities of lightless deeps .</l>
       <l n="139">But still in dreamless sleep the stranger lay ,</l>
       <l n="140">With parted lips and breathing soft and calm ;</l>
       <l n="141">About her head unloosed , her hair outshone ,</l>
       <l n="142">Among the grey-green bents , like fine , red gold .</l>
       <l n="143">So beautiful she was that Oswald , pierced</l>
       <l n="144">With quivering rapture , dared no longer bide ,</l>
       <l n="145">But , with quick fingers , softly raised the latch ,</l>
       <l n="146">And stumbled o'er the threshold . As he went ,</l>
       <l n="147">A flock of sea-gulls from the bent-thatched roof</l>
       <l n="148">Rose , querulous , and round him , wheeling , swept ,</l>
       <l n="149">With creaking wings and cold , black eyes agleam ;</l>
       <l n="150">Yet Oswald saw them not , nor heard their cries ;</l>
       <l n="151">Nor saw he , as he paced the eastern crags ,</l>
       <l n="152">How , round the Farnes , the dreaming ocean lay</l>
       <l n="153">In broad , unshadowed , sapphire ecstasy ,</l>
       <l n="154">That glowed to noon through slow , uncounted hours .</l>
       <l n="155">His early gloom had vanished ; time and space</l>
       <l n="156">And earth and sea no longer compassed him ;</l>
       <l n="157">One thought alone consumed him — beauty slept</l>
       <l n="158">Within the shelter of his hermitage ,</l>
       <l n="159">Upon grey , rustling bents , with golden hair .</l>
       <l n="160">He roamed , unresting , till the copper sun</l>
       <l n="161">Sank in a steel-grey sea , and earth and sky</l>
       <l n="162">Were strewn with shadows — wavering and dim —</l>
       <l n="163">To weave a pathway for the dawning moon ,</l>
       <l n="164">That she , from night 's oblivion , might create</l>
       <l n="165">With the cold spell of her enchantments old</l>
       <l n="166">A phantom earth with magical , bright seas ,</l>
       <l n="167">A vaster heaven of unrevealed stars .</l>
       <l n="168">Unmoving , on a headland of swart crag</l>
       <l n="169">That jutted gaunt and sharp against the night ,</l>
       <l n="170">Stood Oswald , cowled and silent . Hour by hour</l>
       <l n="171">He gazed across the sea , which nothing shadowed ,</l>
       <l n="172">Save where — now dim , now white — a lonely sail</l>
       <l n="173">Hung , restless , o'er a fisher 's barren toil .</l>
       <l n="174">Yet Oswald saw nor sail nor moon nor sea :</l>
       <l n="175">His heart kept vigil by the little house</l>
       <l n="176">Wherein the stranger slumbered ; and it seemed</l>
       <l n="177">His life , by some strange power within him stayed ,</l>
       <l n="178">Awaited the unlatching of the door .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="179">But now , within the hut , the sleeper dreamt</l>
       <l n="180">Of foaming caverns and o'erwhelming waters ;</l>
       <l n="181">Then , shuddering awake , awhile she lay ,</l>
       <l n="182">And watched the moonlight , cold and white , which poured</l>
       <l n="183">Through the warm dusk , from the high window-slit ;</l>
       <l n="184">When , all at once , the strangeness of the room</l>
       <l n="185">Closed in upon her with bewildering dread .</l>
       <l n="186">She stirred ; the bents , beneath her , rustled strange ;</l>
       <l n="187">She started in affright , and , swaying , stood</l>
       <l n="188">Within the streaming moonlight , till , at last ,</l>
       <l n="189">In memory , once more disaster swept</l>
       <l n="190">Over her life , and left her , desolate ,</l>
       <l n="191">Upon bleak crags of alien seas unknown .</l>
       <l n="192">Yet , through the tumult of tempestuous dark ,</l>
       <l n="193">Above the echo of despairing cries ,</l>
       <l n="194">A calm voice sounded ; and beyond the whirl</l>
       <l n="195">Of foaming death , wherein she caught the gleam</l>
       <l n="196">Of well-loved faces drowning in cold seas ,</l>
       <l n="197">A living face shone out — a beacon clear :</l>
       <l n="198">Then numbing fear fell from her , and she moved ,</l>
       <l n="199">Unlatched the door , and stole into the night .</l>
       <l n="200">One moment , dazzled by the full-moon glare ,</l>
       <l n="201">She paused , a shivering form within the wide</l>
       <l n="202">And glittering desolation — lone and frail .</l>
       <l n="203">But Oswald , watchful on the eastern scars ,</l>
       <l n="204">Seeing her , forward came with eager pace</l>
       <l n="205">To meet her ; and , as he drew swiftly near ,</l>
       <l n="206">His cowl fell backward ; and she knew again</l>
       <l n="207">The face that calmed the terrors of her dreams .</l>
       <l n="208">Yet , with the knowledge , through her being stole ,</l>
       <l n="209">Vague fear more strange , more impotent than the blind</l>
       <l n="210">Unquestioning dread when death had round her stormed ;</l>
       <l n="211">No peril of the body could arouse</l>
       <l n="212">Such ecstasy of terror in her soul ,</l>
       <l n="213">Which seemed upborne upon the shivering crest</l>
       <l n="214">Of some great wave , just curving , ere it crash</l>
       <l n="215">Upon the crags of time . Yet , though she feared</l>
       <l n="216">When Oswald paused , uncertain , quick she spake ,</l>
       <l n="217">As though she sought to parry doom with words .</l>
       <l n="218">She questioned him — scarce heeding his replies —</l>
       <l n="219">How she had hither come ; when , suddenly ,</l>
       <l n="220">Sped by her fluttering words , the last , dim cloud</l>
       <l n="221">Rolled from her memory , and she saw revealed</l>
       <l n="222">Within a pitiless glare of naked light</l>
       <l n="223">The utmost horror of her desolation .</l>
       <l n="224">Mute with despair , she stood with parted lips ,</l>
       <l n="225">And then cried fiercely : “ Hath the sea upcast</l>
       <l n="226">None other on this shore ? Am I , alone ,</l>
       <l n="227">Of all my kin who sailed in that doomed ship ,</l>
       <l n="228">Flung back to life ? ” And as , with piteous glance ,</l>
       <l n="229">He answered her : “ Ah God , that I , with them ,</l>
       <l n="230">Had died ! O traitor cords that held too sure</l>
       <l n="231">My body to the broken spar of life !</l>
       <l n="232">O feeble seas , that fumed in such wild wrath ,</l>
       <l n="233">Yet could not quench so frail a thing as I ! ”</l>
       <l n="234">With passionate step , across the isle she ran ,</l>
       <l n="235">And leapt from crag to crag , until she stood</l>
       <l n="236">Upon a dizzy scar that jutted sheer</l>
       <l n="237">Above low-lapping waves . Then once again</l>
       <l n="238">Her moaning cry was heard among the Isles :</l>
       <l n="239">“ O bitter waters , give them back to me !</l>
       <l n="240">You shall not keep them ; all your waves of woe</l>
       <l n="241">Cannot withhold from me those dauntless lives</l>
       <l n="242">That were my life . Surely they cannot rest</l>
       <l n="243">Without me ; even from your unfathomed graves</l>
       <l n="244">Surely my love will draw them to my arms ! ”</l>
       <l n="245">As though in tremulous expectation tranced ,</l>
       <l n="246">She yearned , with arms outstretched ; as dawn arose</l>
       <l n="247">Exultant from the sea , and with clear rays</l>
       <l n="248">Kindled her wind-tost hair to streaming flame .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="249">Awhile she stood , then , moaning , slowly sank</l>
       <l n="250">Upon the crag ; and Oswald came to her</l>
       <l n="251">With words of comfort which unloosed her pent</l>
       <l n="252">And aching woe in swift , tumultuous tears .</l>
       <l n="253">Oswald , in silent anguish , drew apart ,</l>
       <l n="254">Gazing , unseeing , o'er the dawning waves ;</l>
       <l n="255">Until at last the tempest of her grief ,</l>
       <l n="256">In low and fitful sobbing , spent itself ;</l>
       <l n="257">When , turning to him , once again she spake ,</l>
       <l n="258">And , shuddering , with faltering voice , outpoured</l>
       <l n="259">The tale of her despair : and Oswald heard</l>
       <l n="260">How she , who sat thus strangely by his side ,</l>
       <l n="261">Marna , a sea-earl 's daughter , had besought</l>
       <l n="262">Her father , when the old sea-hunger lit</l>
       <l n="263">His eyes — as waves shot through with stormy fight —</l>
       <l n="264">For leave to bear him company but once ,</l>
       <l n="265">When , with his sons , he rode the adventurous seas ;</l>
       <l n="266">How he had yielded with reluctant love ;</l>
       <l n="267">And how , from out the firth of some far strand ,</l>
       <l n="268">Their galley rode , beneath a flaming dawn ;</l>
       <l n="269">How her young heart had leapt to see the sails</l>
       <l n="270">Unfurled to take the wind , as , one by one ,</l>
       <l n="271">Toil-glistening rowers shipped the dripping oars ,</l>
       <l n="272">And loosened every sheet before the breeze ;</l>
       <l n="273">How , as the ship with timbers all astrain ,</l>
       <l n="274">Leapt to mid-sea , through Marna 's body thrilled</l>
       <l n="275">A kindred rapture , and there came to her</l>
       <l n="276">The sheer , delirious joy of them true-born</l>
       <l n="277">To wander with the foam — each creaking cord</l>
       <l n="278">That tugged the quivering mast unto her singing</l>
       <l n="279">Of unknown shores and far , enchanted lands ,</l>
       <l n="280">Beyond the blue horizon ; how , all day ,</l>
       <l n="281">They rode , undaunted , through the spinning surf ;</l>
       <l n="282">But , as the sun dipped , in the cold , grey tide ,</l>
       <l n="283">The wind , that since the dawn with steady speed</l>
       <l n="284">Had filled the sails , now came in fitful gusts ,</l>
       <l n="285">Fierce and yet fiercer , till the sullen waves</l>
       <l n="286">Were lashed to anger , and the waters leapt</l>
       <l n="287">To tussle with the furies of the air ;</l>
       <l n="288">And how the ship , in the encounter caught ,</l>
       <l n="289">Was tossed on crests of swirling dark , or dropped</l>
       <l n="290">Between o'erhYpppHeNtoppling walls of whelming night ;</l>
       <l n="291">How in those hours — too dread for thought or speech —</l>
       <l n="292">Her father 's hand had bound her to a spar ;</l>
       <l n="293">And , even as — the cord between his teeth —</l>
       <l n="294">He tugged the last knot sure , the vessel crashed</l>
       <l n="295">Upon a cleaving scar ; and she but saw</l>
       <l n="296">The strong , pale faces looking upon death ,</l>
       <l n="297">Before the fierce , exultant waters closed</l>
       <l n="298">With cold oblivion o'er them ; and no more</l>
       <l n="299">She knew , until she waked within the hut ,</l>
       <l n="300">To find her world , in one disastrous night ,</l>
       <l n="301">In one swift surge of roaring darkness , swept</l>
       <l n="302">From her young feet ; her kindred , home and friends ,</l>
       <l n="303">And all familiar hopes and joys and fears</l>
       <l n="304">Dropt like a garment from her life , which now</l>
       <l n="305">Stood naked on the edge of some new world</l>
       <l n="306">Of unknown terrors .</l>
       <l n="307">Oswald heard her tale</l>
       <l n="308">With pitying glance ; yet in his eyes arose</l>
       <l n="309">A strange , new light , which as each gust of grief</l>
       <l n="310">Shook out the fluttering words , more brightly burned ;</l>
       <l n="311">So that , when Marna ceased , it seemed to her</l>
       <l n="312">That he , in holy contemplation rapt ,</l>
       <l n="313">Had heeded not her woe ; and from her heart</l>
       <l n="314">Burst out a cry : “ Ah God , I am alone ! ”</l>
       <l n="315">But , stung by her shrill anguish , Oswald waked</l>
       <l n="316">From his bright reverie , and his shining eyes</l>
       <l n="317">Darkened with swift compassion , as he turned</l>
       <l n="318">And , trembling , spake : “ Nay , not alone ... ”</l>
       <l n="319">Then mute</l>
       <l n="320">He stood — his pale lips clenched — as though within</l>
       <l n="321">There surged a torrent which he dared not loose .</l>
       <l n="322">Marna looked wondering up ; but , when her eyes</l>
       <l n="323">Saw the white passion of his face , her soul</l>
       <l n="324">Was tossed once more on crests of unknown fears ;</l>
       <l n="325">Yet rapture warred with terror in her heart ;</l>
       <l n="326">She trembled , and her breath came short and quick .</l>
       <l n="327">She dared not raise her eyes again to his ,</l>
       <l n="328">Till , on her straining ears , his words , once more ,</l>
       <l n="329">Fell , slow and cold and clear as water dripping</l>
       <l n="330">Between locked sluice-gates : “ Nothing need you fear .</l>
       <l n="331">Beyond the sea of unknown terrors lie</l>
       <l n="332">White havens of an undiscovered peace .</l>
       <l n="333">For even this bleak , scar-embattled coast</l>
       <l n="334">May yield safe harbour to the storm-spent soul .</l>
       <l n="335">Your world has fallen from you that you may</l>
       <l n="336">Enter another world , more beautiful ,</l>
       <l n="337">Built ‘ neath the shadow of the throne of God .</l>
       <l n="338">There shall you find new friends , who yet will seem</l>
       <l n="339">Familiar to your eyes , because their souls</l>
       <l n="340">Have passed through kindred perils and despairs . ”</l>
       <l n="341">He ceased ; and silence , trembling , ‘ twixt them hung ;</l>
       <l n="342">Till Marna , gazing yet across the sea ,</l>
       <l n="343">Rent it with words : “ Where may I find this peace ? ”</l>
       <l n="344">And Oswald answered : “ In an inland dale</l>
       <l n="345">The Sisters of the Cross await your coming ,</l>
       <l n="346">With ever-open gate . Within seven days ,</l>
       <l n="347">My brethren from the mainland will put out ,</l>
       <l n="348">Bringing me food ; on their return with them</l>
       <l n="349">You may embark . Till then , this barren rock</l>
       <l n="350">Must be your home . ” Exultant light once more</l>
       <l n="351">Leapt , flashing , in the depths of his dark eyes .</l>
       <l n="352">Yet Marna looked not up , but , slowly , spake :</l>
       <l n="353">“ Yea , I must go .... But you .... ”</l>
       <l n="354">Then in dismay</l>
       <l n="355">She stopped , as though the thought had slipped unknown</l>
       <l n="356">From her full heart ; but Oswald caught the words ,</l>
       <l n="357">And spake with hard , quick speech , as if to baffle</l>
       <l n="358">Some doubt that strove within him : “ On this Isle</l>
       <l n="359">I bide , till God shall kindle my weak soul</l>
       <l n="360">To burn , a beacon o'er His lonely seas . ”</l>
       <l n="361">Once more he paused ; and perilous silence swayed</l>
       <l n="362">Between them , until Oswald , quaking , rose ,</l>
       <l n="363">As one who dared no longer rest beneath</l>
       <l n="364">O'erhYpppHeNtoppling doom . Yet , with calm voice , he spake :</l>
       <l n="365">“ Even within this wilderness abides</l>
       <l n="366">Such beauty that , in your brief sojourn here ,</l>
       <l n="367">Your soul shall starve not ; all about you sweeps</l>
       <l n="368">The ever-changing wonder of the sea ;</l>
       <l n="369">But if , too full of bitter memories ,</l>
       <l n="370">The bright waves darken , you may lift your eyes</l>
       <l n="371">To watch the swooping gull ; the flashing tern ;</l>
       <l n="372">The stately cormorant and the kittiwake —</l>
       <l n="373">Most beautiful of all the island-birds ;</l>
       <l n="374">Or , if your woman 's heart should crave some grace</l>
       <l n="375">More exquisite , see , frail bell-campions blow ,</l>
       <l n="376">As foam-flowers on the shallow , sandy turf . ”</l>
       <l n="377">As thus he spake , a light in Marna 's eyes</l>
       <l n="378">Arose , and sorrow left her for awhile :</l>
       <l n="379">And she with bright glance questioned him , and watched</l>
       <l n="380">The hovering gulls , and plucked the snowy blooms ,</l>
       <l n="381">With little cries at each discovered beauty .</l>
       <l n="382">Yet Oswald by her side walked silently ,</l>
       <l n="383">And watched , as one struck mute with anguished fear ,</l>
       <l n="384">Her eager eyes , and heard her chattering words .</l>
       <l n="385">Then , suddenly , he left her , but returned</l>
       <l n="386">Within the hour , with faltering step , and spake</l>
       <l n="387">With tremulous voice : “ We two must part awhile ;</l>
       <l n="388">For I must keep lone vigil in my cell</l>
       <l n="389">Six days and nights , with fasting and with prayer ;</l>
       <l n="390">Meanwhile , within the little hut for you</l>
       <l n="391">Are food and shelter till the brethren come .</l>
       <l n="392">When I must give you over to their care . ”</l>
       <l n="393">Marna , with wondering heart , looked up at him ;</l>
       <l n="394">But such a wild light flickered in his eyes</l>
       <l n="395">She dared not speak ; and , shuddering , he turned ,</l>
       <l n="396">And strode back swiftly to the hermitage .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="397">Marna looked after him with yearning gaze ,</l>
       <l n="398">As though her heart would have her call him back ,</l>
       <l n="399">Yet her lips moved not ; motionless , she watched</l>
       <l n="400">Until he passed from sight ; then , sinking low</l>
       <l n="401">Among the flowers , she wept , she knew not why .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="402">And , as the door closed on him , Oswald fell</l>
       <l n="403">Prone on the cold , black , vigil-furrowed rock</l>
       <l n="404">That paved his narrow cell ; and long he lay</l>
       <l n="405">As in the clutch of some dread waking-trance ,</l>
       <l n="406">Nor stirred until the shadows into night</l>
       <l n="407">Were woven . Then unto his feet he leapt</l>
       <l n="408">With this wild cry : “ O God , why hast Thou sent</l>
       <l n="409">This scourge most bitter for my naked soul ?</l>
       <l n="410">I feared not storm nor solitude , O God ;</l>
       <l n="411">I shrank not from the tempest of Thy wrath ;</l>
       <l n="412">Though oft my weak soul wavered , trampled o'er</l>
       <l n="413">By deedless hours , and yearned unto the world ,</l>
       <l n="414">Ever afresh Thy love hath bound me fast</l>
       <l n="415">Unto this island of Thy lonely seas ;</l>
       <l n="416">And I , who deemed that I at last might reach —</l>
       <l n="417">I who had come through all — Thy golden haven ,</l>
       <l n="418">Knew not Thy hand withheld this last despair ,</l>
       <l n="419">This scourge most bitter , being most beautiful . ”</l>
       <l n="420">Then on his knees he sank , and tried to pray</l>
       <l n="421">Before the Virgin 's shrine , where ever burned</l>
       <l n="422">His votive taper with unfailing light .</l>
       <l n="423">But when his lips would breathe the holy name ,</l>
       <l n="424">His heart cried : “ Marna ! Marna ! ” Every pulse</l>
       <l n="425">Throbbed “ Marna ! ” And his body shook and swayed ,</l>
       <l n="426">As though it strove to utter that one word ,</l>
       <l n="427">And cry it once unto eternal stars ,</l>
       <l n="428">Though it should perish crying . Through the cell</l>
       <l n="429">The silence murmured : “ Marna ! ” And without</l>
       <l n="430">A lone gull wailed it to the windy night .</l>
       <l n="431">He lifted his wild eyes , and in the shrine</l>
       <l n="432">He saw the face of Marna , which outburned</l>
       <l n="433">The flickering taper ; on the gloom up-surged ,</l>
       <l n="434">Foam-white , the face of Marna ; till the dark</l>
       <l n="435">Flowed pitiful o'er him , and on the stone</l>
       <l n="436">He sank unconscious . Night went slowly by ,</l>
       <l n="437">And pale dawn stole in silence through his cell ;</l>
       <l n="438">And , in the light of morn , the taper died ,</l>
       <l n="439">With feeble guttering ; yet he never stirred ,</l>
       <l n="440">Though noonday waxed and waned .</l>
       <l n="441">But Marna roamed</l>
       <l n="442">All night beneath the stars . To her it seemed</l>
       <l n="443">That not until the closing of the door</l>
       <l n="444">Had all hope perished : now death tore , afresh ,</l>
       <l n="445">Her father and her brothers from her arms .</l>
       <l n="446">By day and night and under sun and moon</l>
       <l n="447">She roamed unresting — seeing , heeding naught —</l>
       <l n="448">Till weariness o'ercame her , and she slept ;</l>
       <l n="449">And , as she slumbered , snowy-plumed peace</l>
       <l n="450">Nestled within her heart ; and , when she waked ,</l>
       <l n="451">She only yearned for that dim , cloistral calm ,</l>
       <l n="452">Embosomed deep in some bough-sheltered vale ,</l>
       <l n="453">Whither the boat must bear her .</l>
       <l n="454">In his cell ,</l>
       <l n="455">As night paled slowly to the seventh morn ,</l>
       <l n="456">Oswald arose — the fire within his eyes</l>
       <l n="457">Yet more intense , more fierce . With eager hand</l>
       <l n="458">He clutched the latch , and , flinging wide the door ,</l>
       <l n="459">He strode into the dawn . One moment , dazed ,</l>
       <l n="460">As though bewildered by the light , he paused ;</l>
       <l n="461">But , when his glance in restless roving fell</l>
       <l n="462">On Marna , standing on the western crag</l>
       <l n="463">Against the setting moon , beneath the dawn ,</l>
       <l n="464">His passion surged upon him , and he shook ;</l>
       <l n="465">Then , springing madly forth , he , stumbling , ran ,</l>
       <l n="466">And , falling at her feet upon the rock ,</l>
       <l n="467">His voice rang out in fearful exultation :</l>
       <l n="468">“ You shall not go ! I cannot let you go !</l>
       <l n="469">Has not the tumult tossed you to my breast ?</l>
       <l n="470">Yea , and not all the storms of all the seas</l>
       <l n="471">Shall drag you from me ! Nay , you shall not go !</l>
       <l n="472">For we will live together on this isle</l>
       <l n="473">Which time has builded in the deeps for us —</l>
       <l n="474">We two together , one in ecstasy ,</l>
       <l n="475">Throughout eternity ; for time shall fall</l>
       <l n="476">From off us ; and the world shall be no more :</l>
       <l n="477">And God , if God should stand between us now ... ”</l>
       <l n="478">Faltering , he paused ; and Marna stood , afraid ,</l>
       <l n="479">Quaking before him ; but she spake no word .</l>
       <l n="480">Across the waters came the plash of oars ;</l>
       <l n="481">But Oswald heard them not , and once more cried :</l>
       <l n="482">“ You will not go — thrusting me back to death ?</l>
       <l n="483">For now I know the strange , new thing you brought</l>
       <l n="484">For me from out the storm was life — yea , life ;</l>
       <l n="485">And I am one arisen from the grave .</l>
       <l n="486">You will not thrust me back and take again</l>
       <l n="487">That which you came through storm to bring to me ?</l>
       <l n="488">You will not go ? I cannot let you go ! ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="489">He ceased ; and now the even plash of oars</l>
       <l n="490">Came clearer . One dread moment Marna stood</l>
       <l n="491">Swaying ; then , stretching forth her arms , she cried :</l>
       <l n="492">“ Ah God ! Ah God ! Why hath Thy cold hand set</l>
       <l n="493">This doom upon me ? Must I ever bear</l>
       <l n="494">Death and disaster unto whom I love ?</l>
       <l n="495">Oh , is it not enough that , ‘ neath the wave ,</l>
       <l n="496">Because I sought to bear them company ,</l>

       <l n="515">In rapt , adoring fear ; nor spake , nor stirred .</l>
       <l n="516">Near , and yet nearer , drew the plash of oars ;</l>
       <l n="517">And , turning in the boat , the brethren looked</l>
       <l n="518">With wondering eyes upon them , whispering : “ Lo ,</l>
       <l n="519">Some seraph-messenger of God most high</l>
       <l n="520">Tarries with Oswald . See the strange new peace</l>
       <l n="521">That burns his face like a white altar-flame .</l>
       <l n="522">Not yet must we draw near , lest our weak sight</l>

        <l n="6">To sudden manhood , though , but now , he knelt</l>
        <l n="7">A vigil-wearied squire before the throne .</l>
        <l n="8">He paused one moment while the people turned</l>
        <l n="9">To look on him with eyes that kindled bright ,</l>
        <l n="10">Seeing his face aglow with strange , new light ;</l>
        <l n="11">Yet them he saw not where they watched amazed ,</l>
        <l n="12">And , though like azure flames Queen Hild 's eyes burned ,</l>
        <l n="13">Beyond the shadow of the throne he gazed</l>
        <l n="14">To where , in kindred rapture , young Christine</l>
        <l n="15">Stood , tremulous and white , in wind-flower grace —</l>
        <l n="16">Beneath her thick , dark hair , her happy face</l>
        <l n="17">Pale-gleaming ‘ midst the ruddy maiden-throng ;</l>
        <l n="18">But , following Geoffrey 's eyes , the trembling Queen</l>
        <l n="19">Now bade the harpers rouse the air with song :</l>
        <l n="20">From pulsing throat and silver-throbbing string</l>
        <l n="21">The music soared , light-winged , and , fluttering , fell ;</l>
        <l n="22">When , startled as one waking from a spell ,</l>
        <l n="23">Geoffrey stepped back among the waiting knights ;</l>
        <l n="24">While knelt another squire before the King .</l>
        <l n="25">In Queen Hild 's eyes yet hovered stormy lights ,</l>
        <l n="26">Beneath her glooming brows , as waters gleam</l>
        <l n="27">Under snow-laden skies ; the summer day</l>
        <l n="28">For her in that brief glance had shivered grey ,</l>
        <l n="29">Empty of light and song . She only heard</l>
        <l n="30">The King and knights as people of a dream ;</l>
        <l n="31">Yet keenly Geoffrey 's lightest , laughing word</l>
        <l n="32">Stung to the quick , and stabbed her quivering life ,</l>
        <l n="33">Till from each shuddering wound the red joy flowed ;</l>
        <l n="34">And , though a ruddy fire on each cheek glowed ,</l>
        <l n="35">She felt her drained heart within her cold ;</l>
        <l n="36">Then all at once a hot thought stirred new strife</l>
        <l n="37">Within her breast , and suddenly grown old</l>
        <l n="38">And wise in treacherous imagining ,</l>
        <l n="39">She pressed her thin lips to a bitter smile ,</l>
        <l n="40">And strove with laughing mask to hide the guile</l>
        <l n="41">That , slowly welling , through her body poured</l>
        <l n="42">Cold-blooded life that feels no arrowy sting</l>
        <l n="43">Of joy or hope , nor thrust of pity 's sword .</l>
        <l n="44">To Christine , where she yet enraptured stood ,</l>
        <l n="45">Hild , turning , spake kind words , and coldly praised</l>
        <l n="46">The new-made knight . Each word Christine amazed</l>
        <l n="47">Drank in with joyous heart and eager ears ;</l>
        <l n="48">To her it seemed ne'er lived a Queen so good ;</l>
        <l n="49">And love 's swift rapture filled her eyes with tears .</l>
        <l n="50">For her true heart , the day-long pageant moved</l>
        <l n="51">Round Geoffrey 's shining presence ; king and knight</l>
        <l n="52">But shone for her with pale , reflected light .</l>
        <l n="53">As tranced planets circling round the sun ,</l>
        <l n="54">About the radiant head of her beloved</l>
        <l n="55">The dim throngs moved until the day was done .</l>
        <l n="56">When lucent gold suffused the cloudless west ,</l>
        <l n="57">And lingering thrush-notes failed in drowsy song ,</l>
        <l n="58">She left , at last , the weary maiden-throng ,</l>
        <l n="59">To stray alone through dew-hung garden-glades ;</l>
        <l n="60">And all the love unsealed within her breast</l>
        <l n="61">Flowed out from her to light the darkest shades .</l>
        <l n="62">Her quivering maiden-body could not hold</l>
        <l n="63">The sudden welling of love 's loosened flood ;</l>
        <l n="64">Through all her limbs it gushed , and in her blood</l>
        <l n="65">It stormed each throbbing pulse with blissful ache ;</l>
        <l n="66">It seemed to spray the utmost glooms with gold ,</l>
        <l n="67">And scatter glistening dews in every brake .</l>
        <l n="68">While yet she moved in rapture unafraid</l>
        <l n="69">Among the lilies , down the Grey Nun 's Walk ,</l>
        <l n="70">She heard behind the snapping of a stalk ,</l>
        <l n="71">And stayed transfixed , nor dared to turn her head ,</l>
        <l n="72">But stood a solitary , trembling maid —</l>
        <l n="73">Forlorn and frail , with all her courage fled .</l>
        <l n="74">Thus Geoffrey found her as , hot-foot , he pressed</l>
        <l n="75">To pour about her all the glowing tide</l>
        <l n="76">Day-pent within his heart ; the flood-gates wide ,</l>
        <l n="77">His love swept over her , sea after sea ,</l>
        <l n="78">Until life almost swooned within her breast ,</l>
        <l n="79">And she seemed like to drown in ecstasy .</l>
        <l n="80">Yet , as the tempest sank in calm at last ,</l>
        <l n="81">She rose from out the foam of love , new-born —</l>
        <l n="82">As Venus from the irised surf of morn —</l>
        <l n="83">To such triumphant beauty , Geoffrey , thralled ,</l>
        <l n="84">Before her stood in wonder rooted fast ;</l>
        <l n="85">Even his love within him bowed appalled</l>
        <l n="86">In tongueless worship as he gazed on her ;</l>
        <l n="87">While , lily-like , the tranced flowers among ,</l>
        <l n="88">She stood , love-radiant , and above her hung</l>
        <l n="89">The canopy of star-enkindling night ;</l>
        <l n="90">Though , when again she moved with joyous stir ,</l>
        <l n="91">He sprang to her in love 's unchallenged might .</l>

        <l n="92">All night , beside her slumbering lord , the Queen</l>
        <l n="93">Tossed sleepless — every aching sense astrain</l>
        <l n="94">With tingling wakefulness that racked like pain</l>
        <l n="95">Her weary limbs ; all night , in wide-eyed dread ,</l>
        <l n="96">She watched the slow hours moving dark between</l>
        <l n="97">The glimmering window and the curtained bed .</l>
        <l n="98">The fitful calling of the owl , all night ,</l>
        <l n="99">Struck like the voice of terror on her ears ;</l>
        <l n="100">With brushing wings , about her taloned fears</l>
        <l n="101">Fluttered till dawn : when , as the summer gloom ,</l>
        <l n="102">Grey-quivering , spilt in silver-showering light ,</l>
        <l n="103">She rose and stood within the dawning room ,</l>
        <l n="104">Shivering and pale — her long , unbraided hair</l>
        <l n="105">Each moment quickening to a livelier gold</l>
        <l n="106">About her snowy shoulders ; yet , more cold</l>
        <l n="107">Than the still gleam of winter-frozen meres ,</l>
        <l n="108">Her blue eyes shone with strange , unseeing stare ,</l>
        <l n="109">As though they sought to pierce some mist of fears ;</l>
        <l n="110">And , when she turned , the old familiar things</l>
        <l n="111">Unknown and alien seemed to her sight —</l>
        <l n="112">Outworn and faded in the morning light</l>
        <l n="113">The rose-embroidered tapestries , and frail</l>
        <l n="114">The painted Love that hung on irised wings</l>
        <l n="115">Above the sleeping King . Dark-browed and pale</l>
        <l n="116">She looked upon her lord , and fresh despair</l>
        <l n="117">With dreadful calm through all her being stole ,</l>
        <l n="118">And froze with icy breath the flickering soul</l>
        <l n="119">That strove within her . Evil courage steeled</l>
        <l n="120">Her heart once more , as , combing back her hair ,</l>
        <l n="121">She watched the waking world of wood and field :</l>
        <l n="122">Hay-harvesters with long scythes flashing white ;</l>
        <l n="123">The dewy-browsing deer ; the blue smoke-curl</l>
        <l n="124">Above some woodland hut ; a kerchiefed girl</l>
        <l n="125">Driving the kine afield with loitering pace .</l>
        <l n="126">But , as a youthful rider came in sight ,</l>
        <l n="127">She from the casement turned with darkening face ,</l>
        <l n="128">And looked not out again , and fiercely pressed</l>
        <l n="129">Her white teeth in her quivering underlip ,</l>
        <l n="130">To stifle the wild cry that strove to slip</l>
        <l n="131">From her strained throat ; with clutching hands she sought</l>
        <l n="132">To stay the throbbing tumult of her breast</l>
        <l n="133">That fluttered like a bird in meshes caught .</l>

       <lg type="stanza" n="4">
        <l n="134">Christine as yet in dreamless slumber lay</l>
        <l n="135">Within her turret-chamber ; but a bird</l>
        <l n="136">Within the laurel singing softly stirred</l>
        <l n="137">Her eyes to wakeful life , and from her bed</l>
        <l n="138">She rose and stood within the light of day ,</l>
        <l n="139">White-faced and wondering , with lifted head .</l>
        <l n="140">As April-butterflies , new-winged for flight ,</l>
        <l n="141">That poise awhile in quivering amaze ,</l>
        <l n="142">Ere they may dare the unknown , glittering ways</l>
        <l n="143">Of perilous airs — upon the brink of morn</l>
        <l n="144">She paused one moment in the showering light ,</l>
        <l n="145">In radiant ecstasy of youth forlorn .</l>
        <l n="146">Then swift remembrance flushed her virgin snow ,</l>
        <l n="147">And wakened in her eyes the living fire ;</l>
        <l n="148">With joyous haste she drew her bright attire</l>
        <l n="149">About her trembling limbs , with eager hands ,</l>
        <l n="150">Veiling her maiden beauty 's morning glow ,</l>
        <l n="151">Before she looked abroad on meadowlands ,</l>
        <l n="152">Where Geoffrey rode at dawn . Across the blaze</l>
        <l n="153">Of dandelions silvering to seed ,</l>
        <l n="154">She saw his white horse swing with easy speed ;</l>
        <l n="155">He rode with head exultant in the breeze</l>
        <l n="156">That lifted his brown hair . With lingering gaze</l>
        <l n="157">She watched him vanish down an aisle of trees ;</l>
        <l n="158">Then , swiftly gathering her dark hair in braids</l>
        <l n="159">Above her slender neck , she crossed the floor</l>
        <l n="160">With noiseless step , unlatched the creaking door ,</l>
        <l n="161">And stole in trembling silence down the stair ,</l>
        <l n="162">Intent to reach the garden ere the maids</l>
        <l n="163">Should come with chattering tongues and laughter there ;</l>
        <l n="164">When by her side she heard a rustling stir :</l>
        <l n="165">The arras parted , and before her stood</l>
        <l n="166">Queen Hild in proud , imperious womanhood ,</l>
        <l n="167">Looking upon her with cold , smiling eyes .</l>
        <l n="168">In startled wonder Christine glanced at her .</l>
        <l n="169">Then spake the Queen : “ Do maids thus early rise</l>
        <l n="170">To tend their household duties , or to feed</l>
        <l n="171">The doves , relinquishing sleep 's precious hours</l>
        <l n="172">To see the morning dew upon the flowers</l>
        <l n="173">And what frail blooms have perished ‘ neath the moon ?</l>
        <l n="174">To reach the Grey Nun 's Walk , mayhap you speed —</l>
        <l n="175">To count the stricken buds of lilies strewn</l>
        <l n="176">O'ernight upon the soil by careless feet</l>
        <l n="177">That wandered there so late ? Yea , now I know ,</l>
        <l n="178">Christine , because you flush and tremble so .</l>
        <l n="179">Yet look you not on me with eyes that burn ;</l>
        <l n="180">I would not stay you when you go to greet</l>
        <l n="181">The rider of the dawn on his return .</l>
        <l n="182">Think you I leave my bed at break of day —</l>
        <l n="183">I , Hild the Queen — to thwart a lover 's kiss ?</l>
        <l n="184">Think you my love of you could stoop to this ,</l>
        <l n="185">Though you would wed a fledgling , deedless Knight ?</l>
        <l n="186">Nay , shrink you not from me , turn not away ;</l>
        <l n="187">Because my heart has never known love 's light ,</l>
        <l n="188">I fain would hear your happy tale of love ,</l>
        <l n="189">That I may prosper you and your fair youth .</l>
        <l n="190">Will you not trust me ? ” Blind with love 's glad truth ,</l>
        <l n="191">Christine sank down within Hild 's outstretched arms .</l>
        <l n="192">Speechless , awhile , with sobbing breath she strove ;</l>
        <l n="193">Then poured out all the tale of love 's alarms ,</l>
        <l n="194">Raptures , despairs , and deathless ecstasies ,</l>
        <l n="195">In one quick torrent from her brimming heart ;</l>
        <l n="196">Then , quaking , ceased , and drew herself apart ,</l>
        <l n="197">Dismayed that she so easily had revealed</l>
        <l n="198">To this white , cold-eyed Queen love 's sanctities .</l>
        <l n="199">Yet Hild moved not , but stood , with hard lips sealed ,</l>
        <l n="200">Until , the chiming of the turret-bell</l>
        <l n="201">Recalling her , she spake with far-off voice :</l>
        <l n="202">“ I , loveless , in your innocent love rejoice .</l>
        <l n="203">May nothing stem its eager raptured course !</l>
        <l n="204">Oh , that my barren heart could love so well ,</l>
        <l n="205">And feel the surge of love 's subduing force !</l>
        <l n="206">Yet even I from out my dearth may give</l>
        <l n="207">To you , Christine . Would you that Geoffrey 's name</l>
        <l n="208">Shall shine , unchallenged , on the lists of fame ?</l>
        <l n="209">If you would have him win for you the crown</l>
        <l n="210">Of knightly immortality , and live</l>
        <l n="211">Triumphant on men 's tongues in high renown ,</l>
        <l n="212">Follow me now . ” With cold , exulting eyes</l>
        <l n="213">She raised the arras , opening to the light</l>
        <l n="214">An unknown stair-way clambering into night .</l>
        <l n="215">Within the caverned wall she swiftly passed .</l>
        <l n="216">Christine for one brief moment in surprise</l>
        <l n="217">Uncertain paused ; then , wondering , followed fast .</l>
        <l n="218">The falling arras shutting out the day ,</l>
        <l n="219">She stumbled blindly through the soaring gloom —</l>
        <l n="220">Enclosing dank and chilly as the tomb</l>
        <l n="221">Her panting life ; and unto her it seemed</l>
        <l n="222">That ever , as she climbed , more sheer the way</l>
        <l n="223">Before her rose , and ever fainter gleamed</l>
        <l n="224">The wan , white star of light that overhead</l>
        <l n="225">Hovered remote . Far up the stair she heard</l>
        <l n="226">A silken rustling as , without a word ,</l>
        <l n="227">Relentlessly Queen Hild before her sped</l>
        <l n="228">For ever up the ever-soaring steep .</l>
        <l n="229">But when it almost seemed that she must fall —</l>
        <l n="230">So loudly in her ears the pulses beat ,</l>
        <l n="231">And each step seemed to sink beneath her feet —</l>
        <l n="232">She heard the shrilly grating of a key ,</l>
        <l n="233">And saw , above her , in the unseen wall ,</l>
        <l n="234">A dazzling square of day break suddenly .</l>
        <l n="235">Within the lighted doorway Queen Hild turned</l>
        <l n="236">To reach a helping hand , and , as she bent</l>
        <l n="237">To clutch the swooning maiden , well-nigh spent ,</l>
        <l n="238">And drew her to the chamber , weak and faint ,</l>
        <l n="239">Through her gold hair so rare a lustre burned ,</l>
        <l n="240">It seemed to Christine that an aureoled saint</l>
        <l n="241">Leaned out from heaven to snatch her from the deep .</l>
        <l n="242">Then , dizzily , she sank upon the floor ,</l>
        <l n="243">Dreaming that toil was over evermore ,</l>
        <l n="244">And she secure in Love 's celestial fold ;</l>
        <l n="245">Till , waking gradually as from a sleep ,</l>
        <l n="246">Her dark eyes opened on a blaze of gold .</l>
        <l n="247">She sat within a chamber hung around</l>
        <l n="248">With glistering tapestry , whereon a knight ,</l>
        <l n="249">Who bore a golden helm above the fight ,</l>
        <l n="250">For ever triumphed o'er assailing swords ,</l>
        <l n="251">Or led the greenwood chase with horse and hound ,</l>
        <l n="252">While far behind him lagged the dames and lords</l>
        <l n="253">And all the hunting train ; till he , at length ,</l>
        <l n="254">Brought low the antlered quarry on the brink</l>
        <l n="255">Of some deep , craggy cleft , wherefrom did shrink</l>
        <l n="256">The quailing hounds with lathered flanks aquake .</l>
        <l n="257">As Christine looked on them , her maiden-strength</l>
        <l n="258">Returned to her ; and now , more broad awake ,</l>
        <l n="259">She saw , within the centre of the room ,</l>
        <l n="260">A golden table whereon glittered bright</l>
        <l n="261">A casket of wrought gold , and , in the light ,</l>
        <l n="262">Queen Hild , awaiting her , with smiling lips ,</l>
        <l n="263">And laughing words : “ Is this then love 's sad doom ,</l>
        <l n="264">To perish , fainting , in light 's brief eclipse</l>
        <l n="265">Between a curtain and a closed door ?</l>
        <l n="266">Shall this bright casket ever hold , unsought ,</l>
        <l n="267">The golden helm — in elfin-ages wrought</l>
        <l n="268">For some star-destined knight — because love 's heart</l>
        <l n="269">Grows faint within her ? Shall the world no more</l>
        <l n="270">Acclaim its helmed lord ? ” But , with a start ,</l>
        <l n="271">Christine arose , and swiftly forward came</l>
        <l n="272">With eager eyes , and stooped with fluttering breast —</l>
        <l n="273">Her slender , shapely hands together pressed</l>
        <l n="274">In tense expectancy , and all her face</l>
        <l n="275">With quivering light of wondering love aflame .</l>
        <l n="276">The Queen bent down , and in a breathing space</l>
        <l n="277">Unlocked the casket with a golden key ,</l>
        <l n="278">And deftly loosed a little golden pin ;</l>
        <l n="279">The heavy lid swung open and , within ,</l>
        <l n="280">To Christine 's eyes revealed the golden helm .</l>
        <l n="281">Then spake Queen Hild , once more : “ Your love-gift see !</l>
        <l n="282">Think you that any smith in all the realm</l>
        <l n="283">Can beat dull metal to so fair a casque ?</l>
        <l n="284">In jewelled caverns of enchantment old</l>
        <l n="285">This helm was wrought of magic-tempered gold</l>
        <l n="286">To yieldless strength , by elfin-hammers chased ,</l>
        <l n="287">That toiled unwearied at their age-long task ,</l>
        <l n="288">And over it an unknown legend traced</l>
        <l n="289">In letters of some world-forgotten tongue .</l>
        <l n="290">At noon , with careful footing , down the stair</l>
        <l n="291">Unto the hall the casket you must bear ,</l>
        <l n="292">When King and knight are gathered round the board ,</l>
        <l n="293">And , ere the tales be told or songs be sung ,</l>
        <l n="294">Acclaim your love the golden-helmed lord . ”</l>
        <l n="295">Christine , awhile , in speechless wonderment ,</l>
        <l n="296">Hung o'er the glistering helm , and silence fell</l>
        <l n="297">Within the arrased chamber like a spell ;</l>
        <l n="298">While softly , on some distant , sunlit roof ,</l>
        <l n="299">The basking pigeons cooed with deep content ;</l>
        <l n="300">Till , far below , a sudden-clanging hoof</l>
        <l n="301">Startled the morn . The women 's lifted eyes</l>
        <l n="302">One moment met in kindred ecstasy ;</l>
        <l n="303">Then Hild , with hopeless shudder , shaking free ,</l>
        <l n="304">With strained voice spake : “ Why do you longer wait ?</l>
        <l n="305">Your love returns ; shall he , in sad surprise ,</l>
        <l n="306">Find no glad face to greet him at the gate ? ”</l>

        <l n="307">As some new jest was tossed from tongue to tongue ,</l>
        <l n="308">Light laughter rippled round the midday board ,</l>
        <l n="309">Beneath the bannered rafters : dame and lord</l>
        <l n="310">And maid and squire with merry chattering</l>
        <l n="311">Sat feasting ; though no motley humour wrung</l>
        <l n="312">A smile from Hild , where she , beside the King ,</l>
        <l n="313">Watched pale and still . She saw on Geoffrey 's face</l>
        <l n="314">Grave wonder that he caught not anywhere</l>
        <l n="315">Among the maids the dusk of Christine 's hair ,</l>
        <l n="316">Or sunlight of her glance . His eyes , between</l>
        <l n="317">The curtained doorway and her empty place ,</l>
        <l n="318">Kept eager , anxious vigil for Christine .</l>
        <l n="319">But when , at last , the lingering meal nigh o'er ,</l>
        <l n="320">The waking harp-notes trembled through the hush ,</l>
        <l n="321">Like the light , fitful prelude of the thrush</l>
        <l n="322">Ere his full song enchant the domed elm ;</l>
        <l n="323">The arras parting , through the open door</l>
        <l n="324">She came . Before her borne , the golden helm</l>
        <l n="325">Within the dim-lit hall shone out so bright ,</l>
        <l n="326">That lord and dame in rustling wonder rose ,</l>
        <l n="327">And squire and maiden sought to gather close ,</l>
        <l n="328">With questioning lips , about the love-bright maid .</l>
        <l n="329">Christine , unheeding , turned nor left nor right ;</l>
        <l n="330">With lifted head and eager step unstayed ,</l>
        <l n="331">She strode to Geoffrey , while he stood alone ,</l>
        <l n="332">Radiant with wondering love — as one who sees</l>
        <l n="333">The light of high , eternal mysteries</l>
        <l n="334">Illume awhile the mortal shade that moves</l>
        <l n="335">From out oblivion unto night unknown ,</l>
        <l n="336">Hugging a little grace of joys and loves .</l>
        <l n="337">Before him now she came and , kneeling , spake ,</l>
        <l n="338">With slow , clear-welling voice : “ In ages old</l>
        <l n="339">This helm was wrought from elfin-hammered gold ,</l>
        <l n="340">For one who , in the after-days , should be</l>
        <l n="341">Supreme above his kind , as , in the brake</l>
        <l n="342">Of branching fern , the solitary tree</l>
        <l n="343">That crests the fell-top . Unto you I bring</l>
        <l n="344">The gift of destiny , that , as the sun</l>
        <l n="345">New-risen of your knighthood , newly-won ,</l>
        <l n="346">The wondering world may see its glory shine . ”</l>
        <l n="347">As Christine spake , with questioning glance the King</l>
        <l n="348">Turned to the Queen , who gave no answering sign .</l>
        <l n="349">Then , stretching forth his arm , he cried : “ Sir knight ,</l>
        <l n="350">I know not by what evil chance this maid</l>
        <l n="351">Has climbed the secret newell-stair unstayed</l>
        <l n="352">And reached the casket-chamber , and has borne</l>
        <l n="353">From thence the Helm of Strife , whereon the light</l>
        <l n="354">Of day has never fallen , night or morn ,</l>
        <l n="355">For seven hundred years ; but , ere you take</l>
        <l n="356">The doomful gift , know this : he who shall dare</l>
        <l n="357">To don the golden helm must ever fare</l>
        <l n="358">Upon the edge of peril , ever ride</l>
        <l n="359">Between dark-ambushed dangers , ever wake</l>
        <l n="360">Unto the thunderous crash of battle-tide .</l>
        <l n="361">Oh , pause before you take the fateful helm .</l>
        <l n="362">Will you , so young , forego , for evermore ,</l>
        <l n="363">The sheltered haven-raptures of the shore ,</l>
        <l n="364">To strive in ceaseless tempest , till , at last ,</l>
        <l n="365">The fury-crested wave shall overwhelm</l>
        <l n="366">Your broken life on death 's dark crag upcast ? ”</l>
        <l n="367">He ceased , and stood with eyes of hot appeal ;</l>
        <l n="368">An aching silence shuddered through the hall ;</l>
        <l n="369">None stirred nor spake , though , swaying like to fall ,</l>
        <l n="370">Christine , in mute , imploring agony ,</l>
        <l n="371">Wavered nigh death . As glittering points of steel</l>
        <l n="372">Queen Hild 's eyes gleamed in bitter victory .</l>
        <l n="373">But all were turned to Geoffrey , where he stood</l>
        <l n="374">In pillared might of manhood , very fair ;</l>
        <l n="375">His face a little paled beneath his hair ,</l>
        <l n="376">Though bright his eyes with all the light of day .</l>
        <l n="377">At length he spake : “ For evil or for good ,</l>
        <l n="378">I take the Helm of Strife ; let come what may . ”</l>

       <lg type="stanza" n="6">
        <l n="379">Dawn shivered coldly through the meadowlands ;</l>
        <l n="380">The ever-trembling aspens by the stream</l>
        <l n="381">Quivered with chilly light and fitful gleam ;</l>
        <l n="382">Ruffling the heavy foliage of the plane ,</l>
        <l n="383">Until the leaves turned , like pale , lifted hands ,</l>
        <l n="384">A cold gust stirred with presage of near rain .</l>
        <l n="385">Coldly the light on Geoffrey 's hauberk fell ;</l>
        <l n="386">But yet more cold on Christine 's heart there lay</l>
        <l n="387">The winter-clutch of grief , as , far away ,</l>
        <l n="388">She saw him ride , and in the stirrup rise</l>
        <l n="389">And , turning , wave to her a last farewell .</l>
        <l n="390">Beyond the ridge he vanished , and her eyes</l>
        <l n="391">Caught the far flashing of the helm of gold</l>
        <l n="392">One moment as it glanced with mocking light ;</l>
        <l n="393">Then naught but tossing pine-trees filled her sight .</l>
        <l n="394">Yet darker gloomed the woodlands ‘ neath the drench</l>
        <l n="395">Of pillared showers ; colder and yet more cold</l>
        <l n="396">Her heart had shuddered since the last , hot wrench</l>
        <l n="397">Of parting overnight . Though still her mouth</l>
        <l n="398">Felt the mute impress of love 's sacred seal ;</l>
        <l n="399">Though still through all her senses seemed to steal</l>
        <l n="400">The heavy fume of wound-wort that had hung</l>
        <l n="401">All night about the hedgerows — parched with drouth ;</l>
        <l n="402">Though the first notes the missel-cock had sung ,</l>
        <l n="403">Ere darkness fled , resounded in her ears ;</l>
        <l n="404">Yet no hot tempest of tumultuous woe</l>
        <l n="405">Shook her young body . As night-fallen snow</l>
        <l n="406">Burdens with numb despair young April 's green ,</l>
        <l n="407">Her sorrow lay upon her ; hopes and fears</l>
        <l n="408">Within her slept . As something vaguely seen</l>
        <l n="409">Nor realised — since yesterday 's dread noon</l>
        <l n="410">Had shattered all love 's triumph — life had passed</l>
        <l n="411">About her like a dream by doom o'ercast .</l>
        <l n="412">Long hours she sat , with silent , folded hands ,</l>
        <l n="413">And face that glimmered like a winter moon</l>
        <l n="414">In cloudy hair . Across the rain-grey lands</l>
        <l n="415">She gazed with eyes unseeing ; till she heard</l>
        <l n="416">A step within her chamber , and her name</l>
        <l n="417">Fell dully on her ear ; then like a flame</l>
        <l n="418">Sharp anguish shot through every aching limb</l>
        <l n="419">With keen remembrance . Suddenly she stirred ,</l>
        <l n="420">And , turning , looked on Hild . “ Grieve you for him ... ”</l>
        <l n="421">The Queen began ; then , with a little gasp ,</l>
        <l n="422">Her voice failed , and she shrank before the gaze</l>
        <l n="423">Of Christine 's eyes , and , shrivelled by the blaze</l>
        <l n="424">Of fires her hand had kindled , all her pride</l>
        <l n="425">Fell shredded , and not even the gold clasp</l>
        <l n="426">Of queenhood held , her naked deed to hide .</l>
        <l n="427">She quailed , and , turning , fled from out the room .</l>
        <l n="428">Soon Christine 's wrath was drowned in whelming grief ,</l>
        <l n="429">And in the fall of tears she found relief —</l>
        <l n="430">As brooding skies in sweet release of rain .</l>
        <l n="431">All day she wept , until , at length , the gloom</l>
        <l n="432">Of eve laid soothing hands upon her pain .</l>
        <l n="433">Then , once again , she rose , calm-browed , and sped</l>
        <l n="434">Downstairs with silent step , and reached , unstayed ,</l>
        <l n="435">The Grey Nun 's Walk , where all alone a maid</l>
        <l n="436">Drank in the rain-cooled air . With low-breathed words ,</l>
        <l n="437">They whispered long together , while , o'erhead ,</l>
        <l n="438">From rain-wet branches rang the song of birds .</l>
        <l n="439">The maiden often paused as in alarm ;</l>
        <l n="440">Then , with uncertain , half-delaying pace ,</l>
        <l n="441">She left Christine , returning in a space</l>
        <l n="442">With Philip , Christine 's brother , a young squire ,</l>
        <l n="443">Who strode by her with careless , swinging arm</l>
        <l n="444">And eager face , with keen , blue eyes afire .</l>
        <l n="445">Then all three stood , with whispering heads bent low ,</l>
        <l n="446">In eager converse clustered ; till , at last ,</l>
        <l n="447">They parted , and , with high hopes beating fast ,</l>
        <l n="448">Christine unto her turret-room returned —</l>
        <l n="449">Her dark eyes bright and all her face aglow ,</l>
        <l n="450">As if some new-lit rapture in her burned .</l>
        <l n="451">About her little chamber swift she moved ,</l>
        <l n="452">Until , at length , in travelling array ,</l>
        <l n="453">She paused to rest , and all-impatient lay</l>
        <l n="454">Upon her snow-white bed , and watched the light</l>
        <l n="455">Fail from the lilied arras that she loved</l>
        <l n="456">Because her hand had wrought each petal white</l>
        <l n="457">And slender , emerald stem . The falling night</l>
        <l n="458">Was lit for her with many a memory</l>
        <l n="459">Of little things she could no longer see ,</l>
        <l n="460">That had been with her in old , happy hours ,</l>
        <l n="461">Before her girlish joys had taken flight</l>
        <l n="462">As morning dews from noon-unfolding flowers .</l>
        <l n="463">For her , with laggard pace the minutes trailed ,</l>
        <l n="464">Till night seemed to eternity outdrawn .</l>
        <l n="465">At last , an hour before the summer-dawn ,</l>
        <l n="466">She rose and once again , with noiseless tread ,</l>
        <l n="467">Crept down the stair , grey-cloaked and closely veiled ,</l>
        <l n="468">While every shadow struck her cold with dread</l>
        <l n="469">Lest , drawing back the arras , Hild should stand</l>
        <l n="470">With mocking smile before her ; but , unstayed ,</l>
        <l n="471">She reached the stair-foot , and , no more afraid ,</l>
        <l n="472">She sought a low and shadow-hidden door ,</l>
        <l n="473">Slid back the silent bolts with eager hand ,</l>
        <l n="474">And stepped into the garden dim once more .</l>
        <l n="475">She quickly crossed a dewy-plashing lawn ,</l>
        <l n="476">And , passing through a little wicket-gate ,</l>
        <l n="477">She reached the road . Not long had she to wait</l>
        <l n="478">Ere , with two bridled horses , Philip came .</l>
        <l n="479">Silent they mounted ; far they fared ere dawn</l>
        <l n="480">Burnished the castle-weathercock to flame .</l>

        <l n="481">Northward they climbed from out the valley mist ;</l>
        <l n="482">Northward they crossed the sun-enchanted fells ;</l>
        <l n="483">Northward they plunged down deep , fern-hidden dells ;</l>
        <l n="484">And northward yet — until the sapphire noon</l>
        <l n="485">Had burned and glowed to thunderous amethyst</l>
        <l n="486">Of evening skies about an opal moon ;</l>
        <l n="487">Northward they followed fast the loud-tongued fame</l>
        <l n="488">Of young Sir Geoffrey of the golden helm ;</l>
        <l n="489">Until it seemed that storm must overwhelm</l>
        <l n="490">Their weary flight . They sought a lodging-place ,</l>
        <l n="491">And soon upon a lonely cell they came</l>
        <l n="492">Wherein a hermit laboured after grace .</l>
        <l n="493">On beds of withered bracken , soft and warm ,</l>
        <l n="494">He housed them , and himself , all night , alone ,</l>
        <l n="495">Knelt in long vigil on the aching stone ,</l>
        <l n="496">Within his little chapel , though , all night ,</l>
        <l n="497">His prayers were drowned by thunders of the storm ,</l>
        <l n="498">And all about him flashed blue , pulsing light .</l>
        <l n="499">Christine in calm , undreaming slumber lay ,</l>
        <l n="500">Nor stirred till , clear and glittering , the morn</l>
        <l n="501">Sang through the forest ; though , with roots uptorn ,</l>
        <l n="502">The mightiest-limbed and highest-soaring oak</l>
        <l n="503">Had fallen charred , with green leaves shrivelled grey .</l>
        <l n="504">At tinkling of the matin-bell she woke ,</l>
        <l n="505">And soon with Philip left the woodland boughs</l>
        <l n="506">For barer uplands . Over tawny bent</l>
        <l n="507">And purpling heath they rode till day was spent ;</l>
        <l n="508">When , down within a broad , green-dusking dale ,</l>
        <l n="509">They sought the shelter of the holy house</l>
        <l n="510">Of God 's White Sisters of the Virgin 's Veil .</l>
        <l n="511">So , day by day , they ever northward pressed ,</l>
        <l n="512">Until they left the lands of peace behind ,</l>
        <l n="513">And rode among the border-hills , where blind</l>
        <l n="514">Insatiate warfare ever rages fierce ;</l>
        <l n="515">Where night-winds ever fan a fiery crest ,</l>
        <l n="516">And dawn 's light breaks on bright , embattled spears :</l>
        <l n="517">A land whose barren hills are helmed with towers ;</l>
        <l n="518">A lone , grey land of battle-wasted shires ;</l>
        <l n="519">A land of blackened barns and empty byres ;</l>
        <l n="520">A land of rock-bound holds and robber-hordes ,</l>
        <l n="521">Of slumberous noons and wakeful midnight hours ,</l>
        <l n="522">Of ambushed dark and moonlight flashing swords .</l>
        <l n="523">With hand on hilt and ever-kindling eyes ,</l>
        <l n="524">Flushed face and quivering nostril , Philip rode ;</l>
        <l n="525">But nought assailed them ; every lone abode</l>
        <l n="526">Forsaken seemed ; all empty lay the land</l>
        <l n="527">Beneath the empty sky ; only the cries</l>
        <l n="528">Of plovers pierced the blue on either hand ;</l>
        <l n="529">Until , at sudden cresting of a hill ,</l>
        <l n="530">The clang of battle sounded on their ears ,</l>
        <l n="531">And , far below , they saw a surge of spears</l>
        <l n="532">Crash on unyielding ranks ; while , from the sea</l>
        <l n="533">Of striving steel , with deathly singing shrill ,</l>
        <l n="534">A spray of arrows flickered fitfully .</l>
        <l n="535">Amazed they stood , wide-eyed , with holden breath ;</l>
        <l n="536">When , of a sudden , flashed upon their sight</l>
        <l n="537">The golden helm in midmost of the fight ,</l>
        <l n="538">Where , with high-lifted head and undismayed ,</l>
        <l n="539">Sir Geoffrey rode , a very lord of death ,</l>
        <l n="540">With ever-leaping , ever-crashing blade .</l>
        <l n="541">Christine watched long , now cold with quaking dread ,</l>
        <l n="542">Now hot with hope as each assailant fell ;</l>
        <l n="543">The bright sword held her gaze as by a spell ;</l>
        <l n="544">Because love blinded her to all but love ,</l>
        <l n="545">Unmoved she watched the foemen shudder dead ,</l>
        <l n="546">She whose heart erst the meanest woe could move .</l>
        <l n="547">Then , dazed , she saw a solitary shaft ,</l>
        <l n="548">Unloosed with certain aim from out the bow ,</l>
        <l n="549">Strike clean through Geoffrey 's hauberk , and bring low</l>
        <l n="550">The golden helm , while o'er him swiftly met</l>
        <l n="551">The tides of fight . Christine a little laughed</l>
        <l n="552">With rattling throat , and stood with still eyes set .</l>
        <l n="553">Scarce Philip dared to raise his eyes to hers</l>
        <l n="554">To see the terror there . No word she spake ,</l>
        <l n="555">But leaned a little forward through the brake</l>
        <l n="556">That bloomed about her in a golden blaze ;</l>
        <l n="557">Her hands were torn to bleeding by the furze ,</l>
        <l n="558">Yet nothing could disturb that dreadful gaze .</l>
        <l n="559">Then , gradually , the heaving battle swerved</l>
        <l n="560">To northward , faltering broken , and afar</l>
        <l n="561">It closed again , where , round a jutting scar ,</l>
        <l n="562">The flashing torrent of the river curved .</l>
        <l n="563">With eager step Christine ran down the hill ,</l>
        <l n="564">And sped across the late-forsaken field</l>
        <l n="565">To where , with shattered sword and splintered shield ,</l>
        <l n="566">Among the mounded bodies Geoffrey lay .</l>
        <l n="567">She loosed his helm , but deathly pale and still</l>
        <l n="568">His young face gleamed within the light of day .</l>
        <l n="569">Christine beside him knelt , as Philip sought</l>
        <l n="570">A draught of water from the peat-born stream ;</l>
        <l n="571">When , in his eyes , at last , a fitful gleam</l>
        <l n="572">Flickered , and bending low , with straining ears ,</l>
        <l n="573">The laboured breathing of her name she caught ;</l>
        <l n="574">And over his dead face fell fast her tears .</l>
        <l n="575">Once more towards them the tide of battle swept ;</l>
        <l n="576">Christine moved not . Young Philip on her cried ,</l>
        <l n="577">And strove , in vain , to draw her safe aside .</l>
        <l n="578">A random shaft in her unshielded breast —</l>
        <l n="579">Though hot to stay its course her brother leapt —</l>
        <l n="580">Struck quivering , and she slowly sank to rest .</l>

       <lg type="stanza" n="8">
        <l n="581">Queen Hild sat weaving in her garden-close ,</l>
        <l n="582">When on her startled ear there fell the news</l>
        <l n="583">Of Christine 's flight before the darkling dews</l>
        <l n="584">Had thrilled with dawn . A strand of golden thread</l>
        <l n="585">Slipped from her trembling fingers as she rose</l>
        <l n="586">And hastened to the castle with drooped head .</l>
        <l n="587">All morn she paced within her blinded room ,</l>
        <l n="588">Unresting , to and fro , her white hands clenched ;</l>
        <l n="589">All morn within her tearless eyes , unquenched ,</l>
        <l n="590">Blue fires of anger smouldered , yet no moan</l>
        <l n="591">Escaped her lips . Without , in summer bloom ,</l>
        <l n="592">The garden murmured with bliss-burdened drone</l>
        <l n="593">Of hover-flies and lily-charmed bees ;</l>
        <l n="594">Sometimes a finch lit on the window-ledge ,</l>
        <l n="595">With shrilly pipe , or , from the rose-hung hedge ,</l>
        <l n="596">A blackbird fluted ; yet she neither heard</l>
        <l n="597">Nor heeded aught ; until , by rich degrees ,</l>
        <l n="598">Drowsed into noon the noise of bee and bird .</l>
        <l n="599">Yea , even when , without her chamber , stayed</l>
        <l n="600">A doubtful step , and timid fingers knocked ,</l>
        <l n="601">She answered not , but , swiftly striding , locked</l>
        <l n="602">Yet more secure , with angry-clicking key ,</l>
        <l n="603">The bolted door , and the affrighted maid</l>
        <l n="604">Unto the waiting hall fled , fearfully .</l>
        <l n="605">Wearied at last , upon her bed Queen Hild</l>
        <l n="606">In fitful slumber sank ; but evil dreams</l>
        <l n="607">Of battle-stricken lands and blood-red streams</l>
        <l n="608">Swirled through her brain . Then , suddenly , she woke ,</l>
        <l n="609">Wide-eyed , and sat upright , with body chilled ,</l>
        <l n="610">Though in her throat the hot air seemed to choke .</l>
        <l n="611">Swiftly she rose ; then , binding her loosed hair ,</l>
        <l n="612">She bathed her throbbing brows , and , cold and calm ,</l>
        <l n="613">Downstairs she glided , while the evening-psalm</l>
        <l n="614">In maiden-voices quavered , faint and sweet ,</l>
        <l n="615">And from the chapel-tower , through quivering air ,</l>
        <l n="616">The bell 's clear silver-tinkling clove the heat .</l>
        <l n="617">She strode into the hall where yet the King</l>
        <l n="618">Sat with his knights ; a weary minstrel stirred</l>
        <l n="619">Cool , throbbing wood-notes , throated like a bird ,</l>
        <l n="620">From his soft-stringed lute . With scornful eyes</l>
        <l n="621">Hild looked on them and spake : “ Can nothing sting</l>
        <l n="622">Your slumberous hearts from slothful peace to rise ?</l>
        <l n="623">Must only stripling-knights and maidens ride</l>
        <l n="624">To battle , where , unceasing , foemen wage</l>
        <l n="625">War on your marches , and your wardens rage</l>
        <l n="626">In impotent despair with desperate swords ,</l>
        <l n="627">While you , O King , with sheathed arms abide ? ”</l>
        <l n="628">She paused , and , wondering , the King and lords</l>
        <l n="629">Looked on her mutely ; then , again , she spake :</l>
        <l n="630">“ Shall I , then , and my maidens sally forth</l>
        <l n="631">With battle-brands to conquer the wild north ?</l>
        <l n="632">Yea , I will go ! Who follows after me ? ”</l>
        <l n="633">As by a blow struck suddenly awake ,</l>
        <l n="634">The King leapt up , and , like a clamorous sea ,</l>
        <l n="635">The knights about him . Scornfully the Queen</l>
        <l n="636">Looked on them : “ So my woman 's words have roused</l>
        <l n="637">The hands that slumbered and the hearts that drowsed .</l>
        <l n="638">Make ready then for battle ; ere seven days</l>
        <l n="639">Have passed , the dawn must light your armour 's sheen ,</l>
        <l n="640">And in the sun your pennoned lances blaze . ”</l>
        <l n="641">Her voice ceased ; and a pulsing flame of light</l>
        <l n="642">Flashed through the hall ; in crashing thunder broke</l>
        <l n="643">The heavy , hanging heat ; the rafters woke</l>
        <l n="644">In echo as the rainy torrent poured ;</l>
        <l n="645">Bright gleamed the rapid lightning ; yet more bright</l>
        <l n="646">The war-lust kindled hot in every lord .</l>
        <l n="647">To clang of armour the seventh morning stirred</l>
        <l n="648">From slumber ; restless hoof and champing bit</l>
        <l n="649">Aroused the garth ; and day , arising , lit</l>
        <l n="650">A hundred lances , as , each bolt withdrawn ,</l>
        <l n="651">The courtyard-gate swung wide with noise far-heard ,</l>
        <l n="652">And flickering pennons rode into the dawn —</l>
        <l n="653">Before his knights , the King , and at his side ,</l>
        <l n="654">Queen Hild , with ever-northward-gazing eyes ;</l>
        <l n="655">But , ere they far had fared , in mute surprise</l>
        <l n="656">They stayed and all drew rein , as down the road</l>
        <l n="657">They saw a little band of warriors ride —</l>
        <l n="658">Sore travel-stained — who bore a heavy load</l>
        <l n="659">Upon a branch-hung litter ; while before</l>
        <l n="660">Came Philip , bearing a war-broken lance .</l>
        <l n="661">Though King and lords looked , wondering , in a glance</l>
        <l n="662">Queen Hild had read the sorrow of his face</l>
        <l n="663">And pierced the leaf-hid secret — which e'ermore</l>
        <l n="664">A brand of fire upon her heart would trace .</l>
        <l n="665">Darkness about her swirled , but , with a fierce</l>
        <l n="666">Wild , conquering shudder , shaking herself free ,</l>
        <l n="667">Unto the light she clung , though like a sea</l>
        <l n="668">It surged and eddied round her ; yet so still</l>
        <l n="669">She sat , none knew her steely eyes could pierce</l>
        <l n="670">The leafy screen . With guilty terror chill ,</l>
        <l n="671">She heard the king speak — sadly riding forth :</l>
        <l n="672">“ Whence come you , Philip , battle-stained and slow ?</l>
        <l n="673">What burden bear you with such brows of woe ? ”</l>
        <l n="674">Then Philip answered , mournfully : “ I bring</l>
        <l n="675">Two wanderers home from out the perilous north .</l>
        <l n="676">Prepare to gaze on death 's defeat , O King . ”</l>
        <l n="677">They lowered the litter slowly to the ground ;</l>
        <l n="678">Back fell the branches ; in the light of day ,</l>
        <l n="679">In calm , white sleep Christine and Geoffrey lay ,</l>
        <l n="680">And at their feet the baleful Helm of Strife</l>
        <l n="681">Sword-cloven . Hushed stood all the knights around ,</l>
        <l n="682">When spake the King , alighting : “ Come , O wife ,</l>
        <l n="683">And let us twain , with humble heads low-bowed ,</l>
        <l n="684">Even at the feet of love triumphant stand ,</l>
        <l n="685">A little while together , hand in hand . ”</l>
        <l n="686">The Queen obeyed ; but , fearfully , she shrank</l>
        <l n="687">Before the eyes of death , and , quaking , cowed ,</l>
        <l n="688">With moaning cry , low in the dust she sank .</l>
