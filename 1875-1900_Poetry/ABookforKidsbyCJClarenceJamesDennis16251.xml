    <docTitle><titlePart>A Book for Kids by C J Dennis ( 1921 )</titlePart></docTitle>
    <docImprint>reissued as Roundabout (<date>1935</date>) A very charming gentleman , as old as old could be , Stared a while , and glared a while , and then he said to me : “ Read your books , and heed your books , and put your books away , For you will surely need your books upon a later day . ” And then he wheezed and then he sneezed , and gave me such a look . And he said , “ Mark — ME — boy ! Be careful of your book . ” A very charming gentleman , indeed , he seemed to be . He heaved a sigh and wiped his eye , and then he said to me : “ Take your books and make your books companions — never toys ; For they who so forsake their books grow into gawky boys . ” I do n't know who he was . Do you ? he snuffled at the end ; And he said , “ Mark — ME — boy ! Your book should be your friend . ” DEDICATION To all good children over four And under four-and-eighty Be you not over-prone to pore On matters grave and weighty . Mayhap you 'll find within this book Some touch of Youth 's rare clowning , If you will condescend to look And not descend to frowning . The mind of one small boy may hold Odd fancies and inviting , To guide a hand unsure and old That moves , these days , to writing . For hair once bright , in days of yore , Grows grey ( or somewhat slaty ) , And now , alas , he 's over four , Though under four-and-eighty .</docImprint>

       <l n="2">I 'd like to be a baker , and come when morning breaks ,</l>
       <l n="3">Calling out , “ Beeay-ko ! ” ( that 's the sound he makes ) —</l>
       <l n="4">Riding in a rattle-cart that jogs and jolts and shakes ,</l>
       <l n="5">Selling all the sweetest things a baker ever bakes ;</l>
       <l n="6">Currant-buns and brandy-snaps , pastry all in flakes ;</l>
       <l n="7">But I would n't be a baker if . . .</l>
       <l n="8">I could n't eat the cakes .</l>
       <l n="9">Would you ?</l>

       <l n="8">His billy-can , as black as black ,</l>
       <l n="9">Was just the thing for making tea</l>

       <l n="28">Another fifty mile or so .</l>
       <l n="29">“ Nigh all my life the track I 've walked , ”</l>

       <l n="35">“ Young codger , shun the track , ” he said .</l>

      <head>THE ANT EXPLORER</head>
       <l n="1">Once a little sugar ant made up his mind to roam —</l>
       <l n="2">To fare away far away , far away from home .</l>
       <l n="3">He had eaten all his breakfast , and he had his ma 's consent</l>
       <l n="4">To see what he should chance to see and here 's the way he went —</l>
       <l n="5">Up and down a fern frond , round and round a stone ,</l>
       <l n="6">Down a gloomy gully where he loathed to be alone ,</l>
       <l n="7">Up a mighty mountain range , seven inches high ,</l>
       <l n="8">Through the fearful forest grass that nearly hid the sky ,</l>
       <l n="9">Out along a bracken bridge , bending in the moss ,</l>
       <l n="10">Till he reached a dreadful desert that was feet and feet across .</l>
       <l n="11">‘ Twas a dry , deserted desert , and a trackless land to tread ,</l>
       <l n="12">He wished that he was home again and tucked-up tight in bed .</l>
       <l n="13">His little legs were wobbly , his strength was nearly spent ,</l>
       <l n="14">And so he turned around again and here 's the way he went —</l>
       <l n="15">Back away from desert lands feet and feet across ,</l>
       <l n="16">Back along the bracken bridge bending in the moss ,</l>
       <l n="17">Through the fearful forest grass shutting out the sky ,</l>
       <l n="18">Up a mighty mountain range seven inches high ,</l>
       <l n="19">Down a gloomy gully , where he loathed to be alone ,</l>
       <l n="20">Up and down a fern frond and round and round a stone .</l>
       <l n="21">A dreary ant , a weary ant , resolved no more to roam ,</l>
       <l n="22">He staggered up the garden path and popped back home .</l>

     <head>THE LITTLE RED HOUSE</head>
     <p>Very few grown-up people understand houses . Only children understand them properly , and , if I understand them just a little , it is because I knew Sym . Sym and his wife , Emily Ann , lived in the Little Red House . It was built on a rather big mountain , and there were no other houses near it . At one time , long ago , the mountain had been covered all over with a great forest ; but men had cut the trees down , all but one big Blue-gum , which grew near the Little Red House . The Blue-gum and the Little Red House were great friends , and often had long talks together . The Blue-gum was a very old tree — over a hundred years old — and he was proud of it , and often used to tell of the time , long ago , when blackfellows hunted ‘ possums in his branches . That was before the white men came to the mountain , and before there were any houses near it .</p>
     <p>Once upon a time I put a verse about the mountain and the Little Red House into a book of rhymes which I wrote for grown ups . I do n't think they thought much about it . Very likely they said , “ 0h , it 's just a house on a hill , ” and then forgot it , because they were too busy about other things .</p>
     <p>This is the rhyme :</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">A great mother mountain , and kindly is she ,</l>
       <l n="2">Who nurses young rivers and sends them to sea .</l>
       <l n="3">And , nestled high up on her sheltering lap ,</l>
       <l n="4">Is a little red house , with a little straw cap</l>
       <l n="5">That bears a blue feather of smoke , curling high ,</l>
       <l n="6">And a bunch of red roses cocked over one eye .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>I have tried here to draw the Little Red House for you as well as I can ; and it is n't my fault if it happens to look just a little like somebody 's face . I can n't help it , can I ? if the stones of the door-step look something like teeth , or if the climbing roses make the windows look like a funny pair of spectacles . And if Emily Ann will hang bib fluffy bobs on the window blinds for tassels , and if they swing about in the breeze like moving eyes , well , I am not to blame , am I ? It just happens . The only thing I am sorry for is that I could n't get the big Blue-gum into the picture . Of course , I could have drawn it quite easily , but it was too big .</p>
     <p>Sym and Emily Ann were fond of the Little Red House , and you may be sure the Little Red House was fond of them — he was their home . The only thing that bothered him was that they were sometimes away from home , and then he was miserable , like all empty houses .</p>
     <p>Now , Sym was a tinker — a travelling tinker . He would do a little gardening and farming at home for a while , and then go off about the country for a few days , mending people 's pots and pans and kettles . Usually Sym left Emily Ann at home to keep the Little Red House company , but now and then Emily Ann went with Sym for a trip , and then the Little Red House was very sad indeed .</p>
     <p>One morning , just as the sun was peeping over the edge of the world , the big Blue-gum woke up and stretched his limbs and waited for the Little Red House to say “ Good morning . ” The Blue-gum always waited for the greeting because he was the older , and he liked to have proper respect shown to him by young folk , but the Little Red House did n't say a word .</p>
     <p>The big Blue-gum waited and waited ; but the Little Red House would n't speak .</p>
     <p>After a while the Blue-gum said rather crossly , “ You seem to be out of sorts this morning . ”</p>
     <p>But the Little Red House would n't say a word .</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">“ You certainly do seem as if you had a pain somewhere , ” said the</l>
       <l n="2">Blue-gum . “ And you look funny . You ought to see yourself ! ”</l>
     </lg>
     <p>“ Indeed ? ” snapped the Little Red House , raising his eyebrows just as a puff of wind went by . “ I can n't always be playing the fool , like some people . ”</p>
     <p>“ I 've lived on this mountain , tree and sapling , for over a hundred years , ” replied the big Blue-gum very severely , “ and never before have I been treated with such disrespect . When trees become houses they seem to lose their manners . ”</p>
     <p>“ Forgive me , ” cried the Little Red House . “ I did n't mean to be rude . I was just listening . There are things going on inside me that I do n't like . ”</p>
     <p>“ I hope they are n't ill-treating you , ” said the Blue-gum .</p>
     <p>“ They are going to leave me ! ” sighed the Little Red House .</p>
     <lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">“ And they are laughing quite happily , as if they were glad about it .</l>
       <l n="2">There 's a nice thing for you !— Going to leave me , and laughing about it ! ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="3">“ But perhaps you are wrong , ” said the big Blue-gum , who was not so</l>
       <l n="4">hard-hearted as he seemed .</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>“ I always know , ” moaned the Little Red House . “ I can n't be mistaken . Sym was singing his Tinker 's song this morning long before the sun was up . And then I heard him tell Emily Ann not to forget her umbrella . That means that she is going ; and the little dog is going , and I shall be all alone . ”</p>
     <p>“ Well , ” answered the Blue-gum rather stiffly , “ you still have ME for company . ”</p>
     <p>“ I know , ” sighed the Little Red House . “ Do n't think I 'm ungrateful . But , when they both go away , I sha n't be really and truly a home again until they come back — just an empty house ; and it makes me miserable . How would YOU like to be an empty house ? ”</p>
     <lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">“ Some day I might be , ” replied the Blue-gum , “ if I do n't grow too old .</l>
       <l n="2">There is some fine timber in me yet . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="3">Suddenly there was a great clattering and stamping inside the Little</l>
       <l n="4">House , and Sym began to sing his Tinker 's song .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="5">“ Kettles and pans ! Kettles and pans !</l>
       <l n="6">All the broad earth is the tinkering man 's —</l>
       <l n="7">The green leafy lane or the fields are his home ,</l>
       <l n="8">The road or the river , where'er he way roam .</l>
       <l n="9">He roves for a living and rests where he can .</l>
       <l n="10">Then bring out your kettle ! ho ! kettle or pan ! ”</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>There 's a nice thing for you ! ” said the Little Red House bitterly . “ What kind of a song do you call that ? Any old place is good enough for his home , and I am just nothing ! ”</p>
     <lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">“ Oh , that 's only his way of putting it , ” answered the Blue-gum kindly .</l>
       <l n="2">“ He does n't really mean it , you know ; he wants a change , that 's all . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="3">But the Little Red House would n't say a word .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="4">“ It looks a good deal like rain this morning , does n't it ? ” said the</l>
       <l n="5">Blue-gum cheerfully , trying to change the subject .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="6">But the Little Red House would n't say a word .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="7">Very soon Sym and Emily Ann , carrying bundles , came out of the Little</l>
       <l n="8">Red House , laughing and talking ; and Sym locked the door .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="9">“ Now for a jolly trip ! ” shouted Sym , as he picked up his firepot and</l>
       <l n="10">soldering-irons .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="11">But all at once Emily Ann ceased laughing and looked back wistfully</l>
       <l n="12">at the Little Red House .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="13">“ After all I 'm sorry to leave our little home , ” she said . “ See how</l>
       <l n="14">sad it looks ! ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="9">
       <l n="15">“ Hurry on ! ” cried Sym , who was all eagerness for the trip . Then he ,</l>
       <l n="16">too , looked back . “ Why , you forgot to draw down the blinds , ” he said .</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>“ No , I did n't forget , ” answered Emily Ann , “ but I think it a shame to blindfold the Little Red House while we are away . I just left the blinds up so that he could see things . Good-bye , little home , ” she called . And the Little Red House felt just the least bit comforted to think that Emily Ann was sorry to leave him . Then she went off down the winding path with Sym ; and Sym began to shout his Tinker 's Song again .</p>
     <p>The Little Red House watched them go down the mountain .</p>
     <p>Away they went : through the gate , past the black stump , round by the bracken patch and over the bridge , across the potato paddock , through the sliprails — getting smaller and smaller — past the sign-post , down by the big rocks — getting smaller and smaller — under the tree-ferns , out on to the stony flat , across the red road , until they were just two tiny specks away down in the valley . Then they went through a white gate , round a turn , and the high scrub hid them .</p>
     <p>Had you been able to see the Little Red House just at that moment , you would have been sure he was going to cry — he looked so miserable and so lonely .</p>
     <p>“ Cheer up ! ” said the big Blue-gum .</p>
     <p>But the Little Red House could n't say a word .</p>
     <p>Presently the big Blue-gum groaned loudly .</p>
     <p>“ Oo ! Ah ! Ah ! Golly ! ” groaned the Blue-gum in a strange voice .</p>
     <p>“ I beg your pardon ? said the Little Red House .</p>
     <p>“ Oh , I have a nasty sharp pain in my side , ” said the Blue-gum . “ I do hope and trust it is n't white-ants . It would be simply horrible , if it were . Fancy getting white-ants at my time of life ! Here I have lived on this mountain , tree and sapling , for over a hundred years ; and to think those nasty , white , flabby little things should get me at last is horrible — horrible ! ”</p>
     <p>“ I am sorry , ” said the Little Red House . “ I 'm afraid I 've been very selfish , too . I was forgetting that everyone has troubles of his own ; but I hope it is n't so bad as you fear . ”</p>
     <p>“ It is bad enough , ” groaned the Blue-gum . “ Ow ! There it is again . I 'm afraid it IS white-ants . I can feel the wretched little things nipping . ”</p>
     <p>But the Little Red House hardly heard him . He was thinking again of his own troubles .</p>
     <p>So they stood all through that day , saying very little to each other . Rabbits came and played about the Little Red House , and lizards ran over his door-step , and once a big wallaby went flopping right past the front gate . But the Little Red House paid no attention . He was too busy thinking of his loneliness .</p>
     <p>Birds came and perched in the branches of the big Blue-gum , and chattered and sang to him , trying to tell him the news of other trees on distant mountains . But the big Blue-gum took no notice . He was too busy thinking about white-ants .</p>
     <p>So the sun sank low behind the Little House , and the shadow of the tall Blue-gum began to creep down the mountain and get longer and longer .</p>
     <p>Just as it was growing dark , the big Blue-gum said Suddenly , “ It certainly looks more like rain than ever . The heavy clouds have been gathering all day , and we shall get it properly to-night . ”</p>
     <p>But the rain did not come that night , nor the next day , nor for two days and nights . And all this while the Little Red House and the Big Blue-gum remained silent and miserable — one through loneliness , the other through white-ants .</p>
     <p>But on the evening of the third day the big Blue-gum said , “ The rain will come to-night for certain . I know by the feel of the air . ”</p>
     <p>“ Let it come ! ” said the Little Red House . “ I do n't care . I could n't be more miserable than I am . ”</p>
     <p>Just as he said that , one great rain-drop fell right on the middle of his roof — Plop !</p>
     <p>“ It 's coming already , ” cried the Blue-gum , “ and it 's going to pour . ”</p>
     <p>Then three more big drops fell — Plop ! Plop ! Plop !</p>
     <lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">“ I have never in my life seen such big rain-drops , ” said the Blue-gum .</l>
       <l n="2">“ I 've lived on this mountain , tree and sapling , for — ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="3">But — Crash ! came rain before he could finish ; and in two seconds</l>
       <l n="4">everything was sopping wet . The noise of it was deafening ,</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>“ Why , it 's a cloud-burst ! ” shouted the Blue-gum . “ Half of my leaves have been stripped off already . ” Then he peered through the rain and the dark to see how the Little Red House was taking it . “ Why , what 's the matter with your face ? ” he cried . “ You look awful . ”</p>
     <lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">“ I 'm crying ! ” sobbed the Little Red House . “ That 's all — just crying .</l>
       <l n="2">“ Ca n't you see the tears ? ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="3">“ Nonsense ! ” said the Blue-gum . “ Those are not tears . It 's just the</l>
       <l n="4">rain-water running off your window-sills . ”</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>“ I tell you I 'm crying ! ” wailed the Little Red House . “ I 'm crying bitterly . I should know , should n't I ? I 'm shivering and crying because I 'm cold and lonely and miserable . ”</p>
     <p>“ Oh , very well , ” agreed the Blue-gum . “ You are crying . But if this rain does n't stop soon , you 'll cry the front path away . It certainly is wet . ”</p>
     <p>Very late that night the rain eased a little and then stopped altogether . The tears ceased to run from the eyes of the Little Red House , and they now came only in drops , slower and slower , falling into the great pool by the front door .</p>
     <p>“ It 's a hard world ! ” sobbed the Little Red House , squeezing out another tear .</p>
     <p>“ Listen ! ” cried the Big Blue-gum . “ Do you hear THAT ? ”</p>
     <p>From far away on the distant ranges came a dull , moaning sound . As they listened it grew louder , and right in the middle of of it came another sound — Thump !</p>
     <p>“ That 's wind , ” said the Blue-gum ; “ and a big wind , too . ”</p>
     <p>“ Let it come ! ” sighed the Little Red House . “ I could n't be more miserable than I am . ”</p>
     <p>As he spoke , the moaning grew louder , and there were three or four quite big thumps one after another .</p>
     <p>“ What 's that thumping ? ” asked the little House .</p>
     <p>“ Those are my poor brothers , ” answered the big Blue-gum very sadly , “ Those are trees going down before the big wind . The birds were bringing me messages from those poor fellows quite lately ; and now I shall never hear from them again . It 's very sad . ”</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">“ I never thought the wind could blow down big trees , ” said the Little</l>
       <l n="2">House .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>“ No tree knows when his time will come , ” the big Blue-gum answered gravely . “ I 've had some very narrow escapes in my time , as tree and sapling on this mountain . ”</p>
     <p>The Little Red House was very quiet and thoughtful for a long time after that . Then he asked suddenly , “ Which way do you think you would fall if you did fall ? ”</p>
     <p>But the big Blue-gum said that he could n't tell . It depended on the wind , and he might fall any way .</p>
     <p>“ Not on me ! ” cried the Little House .</p>
     <p>The Blue-gum said that he did n't know ; but he hoped not .</p>
     <p>“ If you DID fall on me , ” said the Little Red House , “ I suppose it would hurt me . ”</p>
     <p>The Blue-gum said it certainly would , and there would be very little left but splinters and glass .</p>
     <p>“ Then do n't ! Please do n't , ” yelled the Little Red House .</p>
     <p>But before they could say another word the great wind struck them with a roar . It tossed the roses about so that the eyebrows of the Little House seemed to be twitching horribly ; and it swayed the big Blue-gum this way and that till he appeared to be fighting for his very life . It picked up the fallen leaves and twigs , and even small stones , and hurled them down the mountain in a cloud .</p>
     <p>In the midst of all the uproar the Little House heard the Blue-gum calling to him .</p>
     <p>“ As long as I 've lived upon this mountain , tree and sapling , ” he shouted , “ I 've never known such a wind . I 'm not so young as I used to be , and I fear that my end has come . ”</p>
     <p>“ Be brave ! Oh , be brave ! ” implored the Little Red House . “ Do n't let him blow you down . I should be so sorry to lose you , What are you grunting for ? ”</p>
     <p>“ I 'm not grunting , ” answered the Blue-gym in a pained voice . “ Those are my roots giving way , one by one . I can n't stand much more of this . Look out ! ”</p>
     <p>The Little Red House looked up , and what he saw terrified him . The big Blue-gum , in the clutch of the wind , was bent right over him , so that the top branches seemed to be just above his roof ; and the great tree appeared to be falling , falling , helplessly .</p>
     <p>“ Do n't fall on me ! ” shrieked the Little Red House . “ Oh , do n't fall on me ; because , if you do , you know you 'll squash me ! I do n't want to be squashed ! ”</p>
     <p>But the big Blue-gum said , “ There is just one little root holding now . If that gives way we are both done for . ”</p>
     <p>“ Be brave ! Oh , be brave ! ” shrieked the Little Red House .</p>
     <p>Then slowly , very slowly , the big Blue-gum began to straighten up again , away from the Little Red House .</p>
     <p>“ I have stood upon this mountain , tree and sapling , for over a hundred years , ” he said when he had recovered ; “ but if it blows like that again , it is the end of me . ”</p>
     <p>But it did not blow like that again ; though the wind howled and shrieked all that day as if it was very angry and disappointed that it could not blow down the big Blue-gum .</p>
     <p>Then , towards evening , the wind fell ; the heavy clouds went away beyond the edge of the sky , and all became very calm and peaceful .</p>
     <p>The birds came from their hiding places and sat in the branches of the Blue-gum and chattered away to him , until he began to feel quite cheerful once more , in spite of his trouble . And when a certain little Tree-creeper — a very wise bird — came and had a long , serious talk with the Blue-gum , he became very much interested indeed and quite happy .</p>
     <p>But the Little Red House was miserable still ; and the beauty of the evening did n't cheer him up one bit .</p>
     <p>“ Ah , well , ” said the Blue-gum , when the darkness came to the mountain , “ I am going to have a good sleep tonight . I 'm a match still for old Daddy Wind , in spite of all his noise and bluster . And there are ways of dealing with white-ants , too . I 've lived upon this mountain , tree and sapling , for — ”</p>
     <p>But as he was talking he fell fast asleep .</p>
     <p>The Little Red House did not sleep . How could he , with his eyes wide open ? So he just stood there all night staring before him , lonely and wretched . And when an owl came and sat in the tree and began to call , “ Mopoke , ” the Little Red House told him rudely to stop his silly noise and clear out . That will just show you how very miserable he was .</p>
     <p>It was quite late next morning when the Blue-gum awoke . He stretched his big limbs , and began to wonder what he might say to comfort the Little Red House . But when the Blue-gum looked down , he saw that the Little Red House was smiling all over his face .</p>
     <p>“ Well , now ! ” cried the big Blue-gum cheerfully . “ That 's the kind of face I like to see in the morning ! So you 've decided to be sensible and forget your loneliness ? ”</p>
     <p>But the Little Red House did n't say a word . He just went on smiling .</p>
     <p>Then the big Blue-gum began to get uneasy .</p>
     <p>“ I do hope your troubles have n't turned you silly , ” he said . “ You have n't lost your senses , have you ? ”</p>
     <p>“ I ? ” cried the Little Red House . “ Why , look down the valley ! See who 's coming ! ”</p>
     <p>Down , far down , the valley , just coming through the white gate , were two figures that looked like tiny specks . And much nearer was another speck , which was certainly a little dog .</p>
     <p>“ It 's them — I mean those are they ! ” shouted the Little Red House happily . “ Sym and Emily Ann ! And here comes our little dog . ”</p>
     <p>“ Well , you certainly have sharp eyes , ” replied the Blue-gum . “ But I suppose I 'm getting old — over a hundred years , you know . ”</p>
     <p>The two figures were through the white gate now , and had crossed the red road out on to the stony flat — getting bigger and bigger as they came ; and the smile on the Little Red House seemed to grow broader and broader . On they came , under the tree-ferns , up by the big rocks , past the sign-post . And now the Little Red House could hear Sym singing his Tinker 's song .</p>
     <p>But it was not quite the same song this time :</p>
     <lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">“ Kettles and pans ! Ho , kettles and pans !</l>
       <l n="2">Where 's there a home like the tinkering man 's ?</l>
       <l n="3">Weary of wandering , home is the place —</l>
       <l n="4">The Little Red House with the smile on his face —</l>
       <l n="5">Weary and hungry , my Emily Ann .</l>
       <l n="6">Then put on the kettle ! Ho , put on the pan ! ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="7">“ Now THAT is the sort of song I DO like , ” said the Little Red House ,</l>
       <l n="8">as he watched them coming up the mountain .</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>On they came , growing bigger and bigger — through the sliprails , across the potato paddock , over the bridge , round by the bracken-patch , past the black stump , through the gate , and here they were , right at the front door .</p>
     <lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">“ Oh , I AM glad to be home again , ” cried Emily Ann . “ And do look at the</l>
       <l n="2">Little House . He seems to be smiling . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="3">“ Of course he is smiling , ” answered Sym ; “ but he has a very dirty face . ”</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>“ The storm did that , ” said Emily Ann . “ Now hurry and get the fire alight , and I 'll put the kettle on . ” And they went inside laughing and singing , while the little dog flew round the house , barking for dear life , and pretending he was very busy seeing everything was in order .</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">“ Now I suppose you 're happy , ” said the big Blue-gum to the Little</l>
       <l n="2">Red House .</l>

     <p>“ Happy ? ” cried the Little House . “ Of course I am . Why , I 'm a home again ! ” But suddenly he remembered that his own happiness had made him forget all about his old friend 's troubles ; and he tried his best to look serious , as he said : “ But what about YOU ? Are the white-ants still troubling you ? ”</p>
     <p>“ Ah ! ” replied the Blue-gum . “ Do n't let that worry you . Yesterday I had a talk with the doctor — Doctor Tree-creeper , you know — a very clever little bird he is , and he knows all about white-ants . He examined me thoroughly all over . He says that they have hardly got under my skin yet , and he will have them all out in a couple of days . So THAT 'S all right . ”</p>
     <p>“ Well , I am glad , ” shouted the Little Red House . “ Now we are ALL happy ! ”</p>
     <p>Then Sym got the fire started , and the smoke curled up , and the Little House had his gay blue feather once again . Sym began to sing his Tinker 's Song louder than ever , and Emily Ann , who was getting the meal ready , joined in and sang too . Very soon the kettle also began to sing , and , when the pan heard that HE began to sing . Then Doctor Tree-creeper arrived to attend to the white-ants , and , as he walked round the trunk of the big Blue-gum , tapping it just like a doctor , HE began to sing . And two Kookaburras , who were sitting on the fence , were so tickled with it all , that they laughed and laughed till they made everyone else laugh with them .</p>
     <p>“ This is quite like old times , ” laughed the big Blue-gum . “ Are you contented now ? ”</p>
     <p>“ Am I contented ? ” cried the Little Red House . “ Am I contented ? Well , what would you think ? ”</p>
     <p>And then — well , most ordinary grown-up folk would tell you that just then Emily Ann drew down one of the front blinds . But all the big Blue-gum knew , and all you and I know , is that the Little Red House winked .</p>
     <p>And when I saw him last , his smile was as broad as ever , and he was still winking .</p>

     <head>THE BOY WHO RODE INTO THE SUNSET</head>
     <p>Once upon a time — it was not so very long ago , either — a little boy , named Neville , lived with his people in a house which was almost in the country . That is to say , it was just at the edge of the city ; and at the back of the house was a rather large hill , which was quite bald .</p>
     <p>Neville , who was fond of playing by himself , would often wander to the top of the bald hill ; and if he stood right on top of it and looked one way , toward the East , he could see right over the city , with all its tall buildings and domes and spires and smoking chimneys . But looking the other way , to the West , he could see for miles over the beautiful country , with its green fields and orchards and white roads and little farm houses .</p>
     <p>One evening Neville was playing alone on the top of the hill when he noticed that one of the very finest sunsets he had ever seen was just coming on . The sky in the West , away over the broad country lands , was filled with little clouds of all sorts and shapes , and they were just beginning to take on the most wonderful colours .</p>
     <p>Neville had often before amused himself with watching clouds and the strange shapes into which they changed themselves — sometimes like great mountain ranges , sometimes like sea-waves , and very often like elephants and lions and seals and all manner of interesting things of that sort . But never before had he been able to make out so many animal shapes in the clouds . The sky was almost as good as a Zoo . There were kangaroos and elephants and a hen with chickens and wallabies and rabbits and a funny man with large ears and all sorts of other peculiar shapes .</p>
     <p>The sun was sinking behind a distant range of hills , where a golden light shone out as if through a gateway . It was so much like a great golden gateway that Neville fell to wondering what might be found on the other side of it .</p>
     <p>Suddenly , right in the middle of all the coloured clouds , he saw one little cloud which was perfectly white , and , as he watched it , he noticed that it seemed to be shaped like a small horse . A very small horse it seemed at that distance ; but , as Neville gazed , it grew bigger and bigger , just as if it were coming toward him very fast , and he was almost certain he could see its legs moving .</p>
     <p>That startled him a little , and so he rubbed his eyes to make sure that they were not playing him tricks .</p>
     <p>When he looked again he was more startled than ever ; for the little white cloud was no longer a cloud , but a little white horse in real earnest . Besides , it had just left the sky and was galloping down the mountain range which he could see away in the West .</p>
     <p>In two minutes it had left the range , and was coming across the fields towards him , jumping the fences , dodging under the trees , and racing across the plain with its white mane and tail tossing as it came . It seemed to be making straight for him .</p>
     <p>He was not really frightened — you must not think that about him — but he was just beginning to wonder if it were not nearly time to go home to dinner , when he noticed that the white horse had stopped , just at the foot of the bald hill . It was looking up at him , tossing its head and pawing the ground — the most beautiful white horse that he had ever seen , even in a circus . Then it appeared to get over its excitement and began to trot quietly up the hill toward him .</p>
     <p>I do not think anyone would have blamed Neville if he had decided then to go home to dinner at once . But he was rather a brave boy , and he was certainly very curious , so he just stood still and waited .</p>
     <p>And here is where the most wonderful part of the story begins . The white horse trotted up to Neville and spoke to him . That would surprise most people ; and Neville was certainly as much surprised as anyone else would have been .</p>
     <p>“ What are you frightened of ? ” asked the white horse in a loud voice .</p>
     <p>Now , Neville WAS just a little frightened by this time ; but he was not going to show it , so he just said , “ Who 's frightened ? ”</p>
     <p>“ YOU 'RE frightened , ” said the white horse , louder than ever . “ You 're only a timid little boy . I thought when I saw you in the distance that you were one of the plucky ones ; but I was mistaken . You 're just a little cowardly-custard . ”</p>
     <p>“ You 'd better be careful who you 're talking to , ” said Neville , suddenly losing his fear . ( Little boys do not always talk good grammar ; otherwise he would have said “ whom ” not “ who . ” ) He hated to be called a “ cowardly-custard . ” “ You 'd better be careful , or I 'll give you a bang ! ”</p>
     <p>“ Ah ha ! ” cried the white horse . “ Very brave all at once , are n't you ? All the same , you 're afraid to come near and stroke me . ”</p>
     <p>“ But I do n't want to stroke you , ” said Neville .</p>
     <p>“ I thought not , ” replied the white horse . “ I thought not , the moment I got close to you . You 're one of the frightened ones , and I 've been wasting my time . ”</p>
     <p>“ Who 's frightened ? ” said Neville again .</p>
     <p>“ You asked that before , ” replied the white horse , “ and I told you . If you 're not frightened , come along and stroke me . There 's nothing to be afraid of . ”</p>
     <p>So Neville walked right up to the white horse and stroked his shoulder . And at once he felt that he had been foolish to hold back . For of all the smooth , soft , silky coats he had ever stroked , that of the white horse was certainly the smoothest , and the softest , and the silkiest . He felt that he could go on stroking it for hours .</p>
     <p>“ There now , ” said the white horse in a voice as soft and silky as his coat . “ There was nothing to be afraid of , was there ? And I think that perhaps I was mistaken about you . I rather think you might be one of those daring boys that one reads about in stories . What about jumping on my back for a little ride ? ”</p>
     <p>Neville ceased to stroke the white horse and drew back a little .</p>
     <p>“ I 'm afraid they 'll be expecting me home for dinner , ” he said . “ I 'm very pleased indeed to have met you . ” Neville was always a polite little boy .</p>
     <p>“ The very thing ! ” cried the white horse . “ Jump on my back and I 'll take you home . You liked stroking me , did n't you ? Well that 's nothing to the ride you will enjoy — simply nothing . Why , all the boldest riders in the world would give their ears just for one little ride on my back . Now then ! One , two , three , and up you go ! ”</p>
     <p>Then before Neville quite knew what he was doing , he made a little run and leapt up astride of the white horse .</p>
     <p>“ I live just over there , ” said Neville , pointing towards his home .</p>
     <p>But before he could say “ knife ” , or even “ scissors ” ( supposing he had wished to say either of these words ) , the white horse laughed a nasty hollow laugh , sprang upwards from the ground , and was soaring through the air toward the dying sunset , right away from home and dinner .</p>
     <p>Neville clung on tightly , for he was so high above the earth that to fall off would mean the end of him . And far beneath him he saw the green fields and the white road , which now seemed like a mere thread .</p>
     <p>“ That 's not fair ! Whoa back ! Whoa back ! ” he shouted to the white horse ; but the white horse made no reply . Indeed , he seemed suddenly not so much like a white horse as like a white cloud shaped like a horse , and Neville saw that he no longer sat upon the horse 's silky coat , but upon something soft and downy like a white fleece , and it was slightly damp . Then he knew that he was riding upon a cloud ; and , as it was quite absurd to go on talking to a cloud , he ceased to cry out . He just sat tight and wondered what would happen next .</p>
     <p>He was high over a farm-house now : one that he used to see from the bald hill . He knew it by the tall pine-trees that grew round it ; and down in the farm-yard he saw a man with a bucket going out to feed the calves . Neville called loudly to him , but the man did not even look up . Now he was far beyond that farm-house and above an orchard , where he saw the fruit-trees standing in straight rows ; and a few seconds later the mountain range was beneath him , and Neville knew that the cloud that looked like a horse was making straight for the golden gateway , which was now glowing dully in a grey sky . He was riding into the sunset .</p>
     <p>Swiftly as the wind that drove it , the Cloud Horse drifted over the mountain range . There was a sudden glow of golden light all about him , and then a flash of colour so wonderful that Neville could not bear to look . He closed his eyes , and , as he did so , he felt that the Cloud Horse had come to a halt at last .</p>
     <p>So Neville sat upon the cloud , not daring to open his eyes for quite a long time . When at last he did look again he almost fainted with the wonder of it . He was inside the sunset .</p>
     <p>But scarcely had he begun to enjoy the wonderful sight , when he was startled by the sound of a funny , shrill little voice close by his side . Looking down , he saw a strange little man , no taller than a walking-stick , and dressed from top to toe in golden-yellow clothes . “ My stars ! ” said the wee yellow man . “ How did YOU manage to get in here ? Do n't you know this is private ? ”</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">“ I 'm very sorry , ” said Neville , “ but I could n't help it . The Cloud</l>
       <l n="2">Horse brought me , you know . ”</l>
     </lg>
     <p>“ Ah ! ” said the wee yellow man . “ He tricked you , did he ? He 's much too playful , that Cloud Horse ; and , I must say , he 's put you in a pretty fix . ”</p>
     <p>“ Excuse me , ” said Neville , “ but do you mind telling me who you are ? ”</p>
     <p>“ I ? ” cried the little yellow man . “ Why , I 'm the Last Sunbeam , of course . I thought you knew that . My job , you know , is to shut up the show when the sunset is over . And it 's pretty hard work , I can tell you , because I 've got to keep on doing it all round the earth every few minutes or so . And it gets very tiresome at times . Would you believe it ? I 've never seen a dawn or a bright mid-day in all my life — just sunsets all the time . Sunsets for breakfast , sunsets for dinner , sunsets for supper . And if I make the tiniest little slip , the head scene-shifter is down on me like a ton of bricks . ”</p>
     <p>“ Goodness me ! ” said Neville . “ I did n't know you had scene-shifters here . ” Neville had been to see pantomimes , and therefore knew what a scene-shifter was .</p>
     <p>“ Then how do you think we shift the scenes ? ” cried the wee yellow man rather crossly . Then he suddenly became very busy about nothing , as he whispered , “ Look out ! Here 's the head scene-shifter coming now . ”</p>
     <p>Looking back , Neville saw , coming towards them , a man with very large ears . He was not a nice-looking man , and he was extremely like the cloud man that Neville had sometimes seen in the sky when he went to look at the sunset from the bald hill .</p>
     <p>“ Now then ! Now then ! ” roared the man with the large ears . “ Move yourself there , Goldie ! We shut up the show here in a few minutes , and open at once on the next range . See that you have that curtain down on time . ”</p>
     <p>“ Certainly , sir , ” replied the little yellow man very humbly .</p>
     <lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">Then the man with the large ears noticed Neville for the first time .</l>
       <l n="2">He frowned darkly , and his big ears seemed to flap with annoyance .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="3">“ Who is this on our Cloud Horse ? ” he roared in his great angry voice .</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>“ Just a little boy , ” said the yellow man — for Neville was far too frightened to speak . “ Just a little boy that the Cloud Horse has been playing tricks on . I think he 'd like to be getting home — just over by the bald hill , if you do n't mind , sir . ”</p>
     <p>“ Certainly not ! ” shouted the man with the large ears . “ The Cloud Horse is not to go out there again to-night , nor the silly little boy either . I 'm not going to have the sunset upset by any such silly nonsense . You mind what I say and attend to your work . ”</p>
     <p>And , without another glance at Neville , the man with the large ears strode off to arrange for the sunset on the next range , miles and miles away .</p>
     <p>Neville gazed at the wee yellow man hopelessly , and the wee yellow man gazed at Neville , and neither spoke a word until the man with the large ears was well out of the way . Then the Last Sunbeam grew quite cheerful again .</p>
     <p>“ Well , ” said he , “ you heard what the head scene-shifter said . You certainly can n't go home by the way you came . The only thing for you to do is to go round . You 'll just about have time to do it , if you hurry . ”</p>
     <p>“ Go round ? ” repeated Neville in a puzzled voice . “ Go round what , round where ? ”</p>
     <p>“ Round the world , of course , ” replied the little yellow man .</p>
     <p>“ Round the world ? ” cried Neville . “ Why you must be making fun of me , and I think that is very unkind . ”</p>
     <p>“ Not a bit of it , ” laughed the little yellow man . “ You need not make such as fuss about it . Why , I go round the world once every day with the sunset . You have only to go a bit faster so as to do it in a few minutes , and with the Cloud Horse to help you that 's easily managed . Do n't you worry about the Cloud Horse . He has got to do just whatever I tell him . Now , excuse me for one moment and I 'll give you full directions . ”</p>
     <p>With that the wee yellow man went behind a pink cloud and came back with a beautiful blue flower in his hand .</p>
     <p>“ This , ” he said , handing the flower to Neville , “ is a Sky Flower . It is made entirely out of a genuine piece of sky , and it is a talisman — that 's a longer word for charm , you know — which takes you free round the world . The one thing you have to remember is that you must n't , on any account , lose that flower until you get home again . Now , just exactly what you have to do is to travel West and race round the world until you catch up with this evening again . It is quite simple . ”</p>
     <p>“ Simple ! ” cried Neville . “ Why I do n't understand it at all . ”</p>
     <p>“ Dear me ! ” said the wee yellow man rather impatiently , “ you are very dense . Now listen carefully . The world , you know , turns round from West to East , and that makes it seem as if the sun is going round the world from East to West . Very well . So what you have to do is to ride West upon the Cloud horse much faster than the sun appears to travel , and catch him up again before he gets well away from here . The Cloud horse is in good condition , and you should easily do it in a few minutes . ”</p>
     <p>“ A few minutes ! ” gasped Neville .</p>
     <p>“ Keep quiet and listen , ” snapped the wee yellow man . “ A few miles West from here you will come into broad daylight . That will be afternoon . After that you will meet mid-day , and , passing that , you will reach the place where it is only dawn . That 's about half-way round the earth . Show the Sky Flower to the porter of the Dawn , and he will let you through . Then you get to the half of the world where it is night , and you must race round that till you reach the place where it is only evening . That will be THIS evening , somewhere about here , for you will have taken only a few minutes altogether . And when you see your own home or the bald hill again , grasp the Sky Flower tightly in your hand , jump off the Cloud horse , and you will float gracefully down to the earth . It wo n't hurt you . Then you can go home , and I hope you will not be late for dinner . ”</p>
     <p>“ But , ” began Neville , “ I can n't understand — ”</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">“ My time is valuable , ” said the wee yellow man , as he shook hands .</l>
       <l n="2">“ Good-bye , and a pleasant journey . ” With that he smacked the Cloud</l>
       <l n="3">Horse smartly on the flank , and in a moment it was racing into the</l>
       <l n="4">West at a most terrific pace .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>Of course , now that aeroplanes have been invented , flying is not thought so wonderful as once it was . But loafing along through the air in a biplane or a monoplane at eighty or a hundred miles an hour is a very tame business when you compare it with racing the day round the world on a Cloud horse . And Neville is very probably the only person who has ever done that yet .</p>
     <p>Almost before he knew what had happened , he had left evening far behind and was riding in broad daylight . The cloud Horse had ridden high in the air , and Neville saw the broad country , with plains and hills and forest lands , stretched far beneath him . An instant later , and the land was no longer below him , but the wide sea , sparkling in brilliant sunlight .</p>
     <p>Before he had time to notice very much he had reached mid-day , high over a strange foreign land , and was racing through the morning toward the dawn . So quickly did he go that there was little chance of seeing anything clearly ; but he had glimpses of many strange sights . Many ships he saw upon the sea — small ships and stately steamers crawling over the ocean like strange water-beetles . Once , as the Cloud Horse drifted low , Neville saw a beautiful sailing-ship , with all sails set , and strange-looking men upon the deck . They looked very like pirates , and perhaps they were ; but Neville had no time to make sure , for the very next minute he was over a wild land where he saw a horde of black men , with spears and clubs , hunting an elephant through a clearing in a great jungle . As he looked , the elephant turned to charge the hunters ; but what happened then Neville did not see , for in a moment more he was above a great city with crowds of people in the streets — people dressed in strange , bright-coloured clothes — and there were bells ringing and whistles blowing . Then a great desert spread beneath him , with no living thing in sight but a great tawny lion prowling over the sand . Then came the sea again , and more ships ; and the light began to grow dim , for he was nearly half-way round the earth , and was approaching the dawn .</p>
     <p>Dimmer grew the light , and dimmer yet , just as though evening were coming — and before him , Neville saw the dawn like a silvery gateway in the sky . Straight toward it the Cloud Horse rushed , and stopped so suddenly that Neville almost fell off .</p>
     <p>“ What 's all this ? What 's all this ? ” cried a small voice ; and Neville saw beside the silver gateway , a little man dressed from top to toe in silver grey . It was the Porter of the Dawn , sometimes called the First Sunbeam .</p>
     <p>Before Neville could answer , the little grey man had caught sight of the Sky Flower .</p>
     <p>“ Ah , you have the talisman , ” said he . “ Pass in ! and do n't stop to gossip , because I 'm very busy this morning . A pleasant journey , ” he added as he smacked the cloud horse on the shoulder ; and in an instant Neville had passed through the dawn and plunged into the night .</p>
     <p>It was a dark night , with no moon , for the sky was overcast with dense clouds . Above these the Cloud horse flew , and overhead Neville saw the rushing stars , and below only the blackness of heavy clouds . But more often the Cloud horse flew low , and then there was little to be seen . By the lights of moving ships Neville knew that sometimes he was above the sea . Sometimes twinkling lights in towns or solitary farms , or the sudden blaze of a great city told him that the land was beneath him . Once , through the blackness , he saw a great forest fire upon an island , and the light of it lit up the sea , and showed the natives crowded upon the beach and in the shallows , and some making off in canoes .</p>
     <p>Then darkness swallowed the Cloud Horse again , and the blazing island was left far behind .</p>
     <p>After that , Neville began to feel a little drowsy . Perhaps he did sleep a little , for the next thing he saw was a faint light in the sky before him , as though the dawn were coming . But he knew it must be the evening , because he was coming back to the place from which he had started , and was catching up with the sun . You see , he had only been gone a few minutes .</p>
     <p>The Cloud Horse flew very low now ; and rapidly the darkness grew less . Then , long before he expected it , Neville saw the roof of his own home below him . He could see the garden in the twilight and his own dog sniffing about among the trees as though in search of him .</p>
     <p>Neville began to think about jumping now , and he was rather nervous . He might land softly and he might not . He only had the wee yellow man 's word for that .</p>
     <p>Then , to his horror , he saw that they had passed his home and were over the bald hill . There was no time to lose . The Cloud Horse was taking him into the sunset again , and , if he did , what would the head scene-shifter say then ?</p>
     <p>So , grasping the Sky Flower very tightly , Neville closed his eyes and jumped . He half expected to fall quickly and be dashed to pieces upon the earth ; but , instead , he floated in the air like a feather , swaying and drifting , and slowly sinking all the time towards the ground . It was a very pleasant sensation indeed .</p>
     <p>The bald hill was beneath him as he came slowly down , down , down .</p>
     <p>He could see the Cloud Horse — now little more than a small white speck — rushing on to catch the sunset . And still he sank down ever so slowly towards the top of the bald hill .</p>
     <p>His little dog had caught sight of him now , and came rushing out the gate and up the bald hill , barking loudly . And he kept on sinking nearer to the earth , down , down , nearer and nearer — and then , quite suddenly , he seemed to forget everything .</p>
     <p>The next thing Neville remembered was feeling something wet and warm upon his cheek . He opened his eyes and saw that the little dog was licking his face . Sitting up , he looked about him . He was in the grass on the top of the bald hill ; night was very near , and the first star was just beginning to twinkle .</p>
     <p>Then , quite suddenly , Neville remembered the Cloud horse and the little yellow man and the little silver man and the head scene-shifter and the wonderful journey and all the rest of it .</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">“ Well , what a remarkable dream , ” said Neville , stretching his arms .</l>
       <l n="2">And , as he did so , the Sky Flower fell from his hand .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>So it was not a dream after all ; for , if it was , how could he explain that Sky Flower ? He picked it up and carried it very tenderly , as he set off home to dinner , his little dog trotting at his heels .</p>
     <lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">“ What a beautiful flower ! ” said Neville 's mother when he got home .</l>
       <l n="2">“ Where ever did you get it ? ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="3">“ It is a piece of the genuine sky , ” said Neville proudly , as he gave</l>
       <l n="4">it to her .</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>His mother smiled at him as she said , “ That is a very nice thing to say , and it certainly does look like a little piece of the sky . But , of course , it could n't possibly be a real piece . ”</p>
     <p>Then Neville knew that if he were to tell the story of his wonderful ride , and tried to explain that he had been right around the world since since he went out to play , his parents would find it very , very hard to believe . So he said nothing , but ate a very good dinner .</p>
     <p>But Neville 's mother put the flower in a vase upon the mantel ; and to this day it is still there , as fresh and bright as ever . It will not fade . Neville 's mother thinks that is a very strange and wonderful thing . And so it is .</p>
     <p>Since that day , when Neville goes to the top of the bald hill to watch a sunset , he is almost sure that , just as the golden light is fading , he can see a little yellow man by the gateway ; and it seems to him that the little yellow man waves a cheery greeting . But , whether this is so or not , Neville always waves back ; and he feels very happy to think that he has a good friend inside the sunset .</p>

      <head>THE LONG ROAD HOME</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">When I go back from Billy 's place I always have to roam</l>
       <l n="2">The mazy road , the crazy road that leads the long way home .</l>
       <l n="3">Ma always says , “ Why do n't you come through Mr Donkin 's land ?</l>
       <l n="4">The footbridge track will bring you back . ” Ma does n't understand .</l>
       <l n="5">I cannot go that way , you know , because of Donkin 's dog ;</l>
       <l n="6">So I set forth and travel north , and cross the fallen log .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="7">Last week , when I was coming by , that log had lizards in it ;</l>
       <l n="8">And you can n't say I stop to play if I just search a minute .</l>
       <l n="9">I look around upon the ground and , if there are no lizards ,</l>
       <l n="10">I go right on and reach the turn in front of Mrs Blizzard 's .</l>
       <l n="11">I do not seek to cross the creek , because it 's deep and floody ,</l>
       <l n="12">And Ma would be annoyed with me if I came home all muddy .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="13">Perhaps I throw a stone or so at Mrs Blizzard 's tank ,</l>
       <l n="14">Because it 's great when I aim straight to hear the stone go “ Plank ! ”</l>
       <l n="15">Then west I wend from Blizzard 's Bend , and not a moment wait ,</l>
       <l n="16">Except , perhaps , at Mr Knapp 's , to swing upon his gate .</l>
       <l n="17">So up the hill I go , until I reach the little paddock</l>
       <l n="18">That Mr Jones at present owns and rents to Mr Craddock .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="19">For boys my size the sudden rise is quite a heavy pull ,</l>
       <l n="20">And yet I fear a short-cut here because of Craddock 's bull ;</l>
       <l n="21">So I just tease the bull till he 's as mad as he can get ,</l>
       <l n="22">And then I face the corner place that 's been so long to let .</l>
       <l n="23">It 's very well for Ma to tell about my dawdling habits .</l>
       <l n="24">What would you do , suppose you knew the place was thick with rabbits ?</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="25">I do not stay for half a day , as Ma declares I do .</l>
       <l n="26">No , not for more than half-an-hour — perhaps an hour — or two .</l>
       <l n="27">Then down the drop I run , slip-slop , where all the road is slithy .</l>
       <l n="28">And have to go quite close , you know , to Mr Horner 's smithy .</l>
       <l n="29">A moment I might tarry by the fence to watch them hammer ,</l>
       <l n="30">And , I must say , learn more that way than doing sums and grammar .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="31">And , if I do sometimes climb through , I do not mean to linger .</l>
       <l n="32">Though I did stay awhile the day Bill Homer burst his finger .</l>
       <l n="33">I just stand there to see the pair bang some hot iron thing</l>
       <l n="34">And watch Bill Horner swing the sledge and hit the anvil — Bing !</l>
       <l n="35">( For Mr Horner and his son are great big brawny fellows :</l>
       <l n="36">Both splendid chaps ! ) And then , perhaps , they let me blow the bellows .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="37">A while I stop beside the shop , and talk to Mr Horner ;</l>
       <l n="38">Then off I run , and race like fun around by Duggan 's Corner .</l>
       <l n="39">It 's getting late , and I do n't wait beside the creek a minute ,</l>
       <l n="40">Except to stop , maybe , and drop a few old pebbles in it .</l>
       <l n="41">A few yards more , and here 's the store that 's kept by Mr Whittle —</l>
       <l n="42">And you can n't say I waste the day if I ‘ ust wait . . . a little .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="43">One day , you know , a year ago , a man gave me a penny ,</l>
       <l n="44">And Mr Whittle sold me sweets ( but not so very many ) .</l>
       <l n="45">You never know your luck , and so I look to see what 's new</l>
       <l n="46">In Mr Whittle 's window . There 's a peppermint or two ,</l>
       <l n="47">Some buttons and tobacco ( Mr Whittle calls it “ baccy ” ) ,</l>
       <l n="48">And fish in tins , and tape , and pins . . . . And then a voice calls , “ Jacky ! ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="9">
       <l n="49">“ I 'm coming , Ma . I 've been so far-around by Duggan 's Corner .</l>
       <l n="50">I had to stay awhile to say ‘ Good day ’ to Mr Horner .</l>
       <l n="51">I feel so fagged ; I 've tramped and dragged through mud and over logs , Ma —</l>
       <l n="52">I could not go short-cuts , you know , because of bulls and dogs , Ma .</l>
       <l n="53">The creek , Ma ? Why , it 's very high ! You do n't call that a gutter ?</l>
       <l n="54">Bill Horner chews tobacco , Ma . . . . I 'd like some bread and butter . ”</l>

       <l n="1">This very charming gentleman , extremely old and gruff ,</l>
       <l n="2">He slowly shook his head and took a great big pinch of snuff ,</l>
       <l n="3">Then he spluttered and he muttered and he loudly shouted “ Fie !</l>
       <l n="4">To tear your books is wicked sir ! and likewise all my eye ! ”</l>
       <l n="5">I do n't know what he meant by that . He had such piercing eyes .</l>
       <l n="6">And , he said , “ Mark — ME — boy ! Books will make you wise . ”</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="7">This very charming gentleman said , “ Hum , ” and “ Hoity , Toit !</l>
       <l n="8">A book is not a building block , a cushion or a quoit .</l>
       <l n="9">Soil your books and spoil your books ? Is that the thing to do ?</l>
       <l n="10">Gammon , sir ! and Spinach , sir ! And Fiddle-faddle , too ! ”</l>
       <l n="11">He blinked so quick , and thumped his stick , then gave me such a stare .</l>
       <l n="12">And he said , “ Mark — ME — boy ! BOOKS — NEED — CARE ! ”</l>
