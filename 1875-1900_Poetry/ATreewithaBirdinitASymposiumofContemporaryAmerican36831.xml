    <head>FOREWORD</head>
    <p n="1">By the Collator</p>
    <p n="2">A little while since , I had the fortune to live in a house , outside of whose windows there grew a pear-tree . On the branches of this tree lived a green bird of indeterminate nature . I do not know what his real name was , but the name , to quote our great exemplar Lewis Carroll , by which his name was called was the Grackle . He seemed perfectly willing to be addressed thus , and accordingly was .</p>
    <p n="3">Aside from watching the Pear-Tree and the Grackle , my other principal occupation that winter was watching the Poetry Society of America now and then at its monthly meetings . It occurred to me finally to invite such members of it as cared to come , following many good examples , to an outdoor symposium under the tree . The result follows .</p>
