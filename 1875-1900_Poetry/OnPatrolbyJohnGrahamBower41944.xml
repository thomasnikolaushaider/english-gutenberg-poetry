    <p>AUTHOR OF ‘ H. M. S. —— ’ William Blackwood and Sons Edinburgh and London 1919 TO D. V. B . They watch us leaving harbour for the greatest game of all , And wonder if we 're coming back across the greedy sea ; They never know the fighting thrill or high adventure 's call — I rather think the women folk are better men than we . But I suspect they say of us as out to sea we go , In all our panoply of pride from Orkney to the Nore : “ It keeps them quiet , we suppose — they like the work , we know — And soon perhaps they 'll tire and play some safer game than War . ”</p>

      <head>Are the prices high and taxes stiff , is the prospect sad and dark ? Have you seen your capital dwindle down as low as the German mark ? Do you feel your troubles around you rise in an endless dreary wall ? Well — thank your God you were born in time for the Greatest War of all .</head>

     <head>SKY SIGNS .</head>
     <p>WHEN ALL THE GUNS ARE SPONGED AND CLEANED , AND FUZES GO TO STORE , WHEN ALL THE WIRELESS STATIONS CRY — “ COME HOME , YOU SHIPS OF WAR ” — “ COME HOME AGAIN AND LEAVE PATROL , NO MATTER WHERE YOU BE . ” We 'll see the lights of England shine , Flashing again on the steaming line , As out of the dark the long grey hulls come rolling in from sea .</p>
     <p>THE LONG-FORGOTTEN LIGHTS WILL SHINE AND GILD THE CLOUDS AHEAD , OVER THE DARK HORIZON-LINE , ACROSS THE DREAMING DEAD THAT WENT TO SEA WITH THE DARK BEHIND AND THE SPIN OF A COIN BEFORE . Mark the gleam of Orfordness , Showing a road we used to guess , From the Shetland Isles to Dover cliffs — the shaded lane of war .</p>
     <p>UP THE CHANNEL WITH GLEAMING PORTS WILL HOMING SQUADRONS GO , AND SEE THE ENGLISH COAST ALIGHT WITH HEADLANDS ALL AGLOW WITH THIRTY THOUSAND CANDLE-POWER FLUNG UP FROM FAR GRIS-NEZ . Portland Bill and the Needles ’ Light — Tompions back in the guns to-night — For English lights are meeting French across the Soldiers ’ Way .</p>
     <p>WHEN WE COME BACK TO ENGLAND THEN , WITH ALL THE WARRING DONE , AND PAINT AND POLISH COME UP THE SIDE TO RULE ON TUBE AND GUN , WE 'LL KNOW BEFORE THE ANCHOR 'S DOWN , THE TIDINGS WON'T BE NEW . Lizard along to the Isle of Wight , Every lamp was burning bright , Northern Lights or Trinity House — we had the news from you !</p>

       <l n="12">No one paid the least attention , so he put the hammer back .</l>

       <l n="15">And he put before the meeting all the questions of the day ,</l>

       <l n="17">With a minor matter for the end — “ What shall the Council do</l>

       <l n="19">With a hundred thousand hirelings of the Hohenzollern Line ,</l>

       <l n="50">Who were still explaining volubly what England ought to do ,</l>
       <l n="51">When the cannon ceased abruptly and they heard the Germans cheer ,</l>
       <l n="52">And a sergeant entered roaring , “ Himmel , Ach ! was Schmutz ist hier !</l>

       <l n="54">Vorwaerts , Carl der Kindermoerder — use your bayonet , Saxon ass ! ”</l>
       <l n="55">Faithful to the last , the Chairman , spying strangers all around ,</l>

       <l n="57">Told them of his best intentions , how with love of them he burned ,</l>
       <l n="58">Shouted as the bayonet caught him , “ Ow ! the Council is adjourned ! ”</l>

       <l n="26">They had some guts to give away , that tried another trip</l>
       <l n="27">In a craft they knew was rather more a coffin than a ship ;</l>
       <l n="28">And they carried out a good attack , and did it very well .</l>
       <l n="29">As a model for the future , why , it beats the books to Hell ,</l>
       <l n="30">A tradition for the U. S. A ., and , yes — for England too ;</l>

       <l n="1">When the battle-worn Horatius , ‘ midst the cheering Roman throng —</l>
       <l n="2">All flushed with pride and triumph as they carried him along —</l>
       <l n="3">Reached the polished porch of marble at the doorway of his home ,</l>

       <l n="9">He hung his battered helmet up and wiped his sandals dry ,</l>
       <l n="10">And set a parting in his hair — the same as you and I .</l>
       <l n="11">His lady kissed him carefully and looked him up and down ,</l>
       <l n="12">And gently disengaged his arm to spare her snowy gown .</l>

       <l n="22">And bold Horatius purred aloud , the stern Horatius smiled ,</l>
       <l n="23">And did n't seem to mind that he was treated like a child .</l>
       <l n="24">Though she did n't call him Emperor , or cling to him and cry ,</l>
