   <p>Piere Vidal Old</p>
   <p>It is of Piere Vidal , the fool par excellence of all Provence , of whom the tale tells how he ran mad , as a wolf , because of his love for Loba of Penautier , and how men hunted him with dogs through the mountains of Cabaret and brought him for dead to the dwelling of this Loba ( she-wolf ) of Penautier , and how she and her Lord had him healed and made welcome , and he stayed some time at that court . He speaks :</p>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">When I but think upon the great dead days</l>
     <l n="2">And turn my mind upon that splendid madness ,</l>

     <l n="4">And blame the sun his gladness ;</l>
     <l n="5">For that the one is dead</l>
     <l n="6">And the red sun mocks my sadness .</l>

     <l n="7">Behold me , Vidal , that was fool of fools !</l>
     <l n="8">Swift as the king wolf was I and as strong</l>
     <l n="9">When tall stags fled me through the alder brakes ,</l>
     <l n="10">And every jongleur knew me in his song ,</l>

   <p>Hymn III</p>
   <p>From the Latin of Marc Antony Flaminius , sixteenth century .</p>
   <p>As a fragile and lovely flower unfolds its gleaming foliage on the breast of the fostering earth , if the dew and the rain draw it forth ; So doth my tender mind flourish , if it be fed with the sweet dew of the fostering spirit , Lacking this , it beginneth straightway to languish , even as a floweret born upon dry earth , if the dew and the rain tend it not .</p>

   <p>SOME EARLY REVIEWS</p>
   <p>The Observer says :— “ It is something , after all , intangible and indescribable that makes the real poetry . Criticism and praise alike give no idea of it Everyone who pretends to know it when he sees it , should read and keep this little book . ”</p>
   <p>The Bookman :— “ No new book of poems for years past has had such a freshness of inspiration , such a strongly individual note , or been more alive with undoubtable promise . ”</p>
   <p>The Daily Chronicle :— ” All his poems are like this , from beginning to end , and in every way , his own , and in a world of his own . For brusque intensity of effect we can hardly compare them to any other work . It is the old miracle that cannot be defined , nothing more than a subtle entanglement of words , so that they rise out of their graves and sing . ”</p>
   <p>From a 3 1 / 2 page detailed critique , by Mr. Edward Thomas , in The English Review .— “ He has ... hardly any of the superficial good qualities of modern versifiers ;... He has not the current melancholy or resignation or unwillingness to live ; nor the kind of feeling for nature that runs to minute description and decorative metaphor . He cannot be usefully compared with any living writers ;... full of personality and with such power to express it , that from the first to the last lines of most of his poems he holds us steadily in his own pure , grave , passionate world .... The beauty of it ( ‘ In praise of Ysolt ’ ) is the beauty of passion , sincerity and intensity , not of beautiful words and images and suggestions ;... the thought dominates the words and is greater than they are . Here ( ‘ Idyl for Glaucus ’ ) the effect is full of human passion and natural magic , without any of the phrases which a reader of modern verse would expect in the treatment of such a subject . This admirable poet .... ”</p>
   <p>The Oxford Magazine :— “ This is a most exciting book of poems . ”</p>
   <p>The Evening Standard :— “ A queer little book which will irritate many readers . ”</p>
   <p>The Morning Post :— ” Mr. Ezra Pound ... immediately compels our admiration by his fearlessness and lack of self-consciousness . ”</p>
   <p>The Isis ( Oxford ):— “ This book has about it the breath of the open air ,... physically and intellectually the verse seems to reproduce the personality with a brief fulness and adequacy . It is only in flexible , lithe measures , such as those which Coventry Patmore chose in his ‘ Unknown Eros , ’ and Mr . Pound chooses here that a fully suitable form for the recital of spiritual experience is to be found . Mr . Pound has a true and invariable feeling for the measures he employs ... this wonderful little book .... ”</p>
   <p>The Daily Telegraph :— “ A poet with individuality .... Thread of true beauty .... lifts it out of the ruck of those many volumes , the writers or which toe the line of poetic convention , and please for no more than a single reading . ”</p>
   <p>Mr. Punch , concerning a certain Mr. Ezekiel Ton :— “ By far the newest poet going , whatever other advertisements may say ; ” and announced as “ the most remarkable thing in poetry since Robert Browning , ” says :— “ He has succeeded where all others have failed , in evolving a blend of the imagery of the unfettered west , the vocabulary of Wardour Street , and the sinister abandon of Borgaic Italy . ”</p>
   <p>Mr. Scott-James , in The Daily News :— “ At first the whole thing may seem to be mere madness and rhetoric , a vain exhibition of force and passion without beauty . But , as we read on , these curious metres of his seem to have a law and order of their own ; the brute force of Mr . Pound 's imagination seems to impart some quality of infectious beauty to his words .... With Mr . Pound there is no eking out of thin sentiment with a melody or a song . He writes out of an exuberance of incontinently struggling ideas and passionate convictions .... He plunges straight into the heart of his theme , and suggests virility in action combined with fierceness , eagerness , and tenderness .... he has individuality , passion , force , and an acquaintance with things that are profoundly moving . ” Mr. Scott-James begins his half-column review of Mr . Pound 's book with a remark that he would “ Like much more space in which to discuss his work , ” and also notes a certain use of spondee and dactyl which “ Comes in strangely and , as we first read it , with the appearance of discord , but afterwards seems to gain a curious and distinctive vigour . ”</p>
