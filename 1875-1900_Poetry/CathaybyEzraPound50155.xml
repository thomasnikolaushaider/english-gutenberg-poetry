   <p>Note .— Jewel stairs , therefore a palace . Grievance , therefore there is something to complain , of . Gauze stockings , therefore a court lady , not a servant who complains . Clear autumn , therefore he has no excuse on account of weather . Also she has come early , for the dew has not merely whitened the stairs , but has soaked her stockings . The poem is especially prized because she utters no direct reproach .</p>

     <l n="55">Tossing it up under the clouds .</l>
     <l n="56">And all this comes to an end .</l>
     <l n="57">And is not again to be met with .</l>

   <p>I have not come to the end of Ernest Fenollosa 's notes by a long way , nor is it entirely perplexity that causes me to cease from translation . True , I can find little to add to one line out of a certain poem :</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ You know well where it was that I walked</l>
     <l n="2">When you had left me . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">In another I find a perfect speech in a literality which</l>
     <l n="4">will be to many most unacceptable . The couplet is as follows :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="5">“ Drawing sword , cut into water , water again flow :</l>
     <l n="6">Raise cup , quench sorrow , sorrow again sorry . ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>There are also other poems , notably the “ Five colour Screen , ” in which Professor Fenollosa was , as an art critic , especially interested , and Rihaku 's sort of Ars Poetica , which might be given with diffidence to an audience of good will . But if I give them , with the necessary breaks for explanation , and a tedium of notes , it is quite certain that the personal hatred in which I am held by many , and the invidia which is directed against me because I have dared openly to declare my belief in certain young artists , will be brought to bear first on the flaws of such translation , and will then be merged into depreciation of the whole book of translations . Therefore I give only these unquestionable poems .</p>
