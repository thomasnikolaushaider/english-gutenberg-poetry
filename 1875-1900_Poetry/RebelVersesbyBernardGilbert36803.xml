    <p>BY THE SAME AUTHOR VERSE : LINCOLNSHIRE LAYS ; FARMING LAYS ; GONE TO THE WAR ; WAR WORKERS . DRAMA : ELDORADO ; THEIR FATHER 'S WILL ; THE RUSKINGTON POACHER . FICTION : WHAT SHALL IT PROFIT ? TATTERSHALL CASTLE ; THE YELLOW FLAG . POLITICAL : FARMERS AND TARIFF REFORM : WHAT EVERY FARMER WANTS : THE FARM LABOURER 'S FIX . MISCELLANEOUS : LIVING LINCOLN ; FORTUNES FOR FARMERS . FROM The New Witness MR. BERNARD GILBERT is one of the discoveries of the War . For years , it seems , he has been writing poetry , but it is only recently that an inapprehensive country has awakened to the fact . Now he is taking his rightful place among our foremost singers . What William Barnes was to Dorset , what T. E. Brown was to the Manx people — this is Mr. Gilbert to the folk of his native county of Lincoln . He has interpreted their lives , their sorrows , their aspirations , with a surprising fidelity . Mr. Gilbert never loses his grip upon realities . One feels that he knows the men of whom he writes in their most intimate moods ; knows , too , their defects , which he does not shrink from recording . There is little of the dreamy idealism of the South in the peasant people of Lincolnshire . The outwardly respectable chapel-goer who asks himself , in a moment of introspection But why not have a good time here ? Why should the Devil have all the beer ? is true to type . But he has , too , his softer moods . Fidelity in friendship , courage , resource and perseverance — these are typical of the men of the Fens . TO MORLEY ROBERTS</p>

     <p>The Rebel</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">I live in music , in poetry , and in the life reflective .</l>
       <l n="2">I seek intellectual boldness in man , I worship mental swiftness in</l>
       <l n="3">women .</l>
       <l n="4">I have no love for lawyers , priests , schoolmasters , or any dogmatic</l>
       <l n="5">men .</l>
       <l n="6">I am with poor against rich , labour against employer , women against</l>
       <l n="7">men ; I fight beside all strikers , mutineers , and rebels .</l>
       <l n="8">I welcome foes ; I desire criticism .</l>
       <l n="9">I loathe prejudice , either social or national ; I repudiate all</l>
       <l n="10">claims .</l>
       <l n="11">I demand freedom of action and leisure for reflection .</l>
       <l n="12">Facing Death , I would say : ‘ I have tasted all , tried all , dared</l>
       <l n="13">all , suffered all , and I repent nothing . ’</l>

       <l n="2">A group of men stood watching round the bed ,</l>

     <p>Old Dame Peach stuck like a leech to any good bargin what fell in her reach , She never let slip what come in her grip : however they turned she was ready for each ; She 'd strip herself bare or sell you her hair , or put up a price for her best china ware , Her very own bed in which she was wed would be yours in a second , if only you dare ; Of childer she 'd lots and would lend you their cots , and although you 'd have backed her to lose in a race , Yet at business she shone when the others wor done ; and nobody ever could stand in her place .</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">Among all the men she took care of her-sen and was never alarmed at</l>
       <l n="2">the roughest of tricks ,</l>
       <l n="3">She 'd sit in a bar suppin ’ ale from a jar , till a bargain was</l>
       <l n="4">driven , her profit to fix .</l>
       <l n="5">Folk knew her all round and none ever was found but at one time or</l>
       <l n="6">other had met her somehow ,</l>
       <l n="7">A good stand-up fight it was all her delight : she would get up at</l>
       <l n="8">midnight to sell you a cow ;</l>
       <l n="9">She bested the men what came out of the Fen , and the folk from the</l>
       <l n="10">Wold they found theirsens sold ,</l>
       <l n="11">While them from the Heath they was allers beneath ; for however they</l>
       <l n="12">tried they was out in the cold .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>The top of the tree was our Mrs. P. at swapping a horse or a cargo of tea , She 'd purchase old wicks or a truckload of bricks or a house full of furniture , just for a spree , Though she 's mounted on high somewhere up in the sky , wherever she is there is business ahead , But I wish she was back when we 'd have a real crack on the friends that are gone and the days that are fled ; When her shop was a store and a thousand things more ; with her busy in-gathering all she could reach : A jewel , a treasure , a caution , a pleasure : Oh ! sadly we miss her , our Old Mrs. Peach .</p>

       <l n="26">An ’ ruin his eyes wi ’ the books he read !</l>
       <l n="27">He raumed an ’ babbled all day long</l>
       <l n="28">About the way to sing a song !</l>
       <l n="29">Follered the lads at plough about</l>
       <l n="30">To hear ‘ em sing would make him shout !</l>
       <l n="31">He 'd sit on the bar of the Ship at night :</l>
       <l n="32">To catch the tunes was his delight ,</l>
       <l n="33">Or to play the fiddle about the town :—</l>
       <l n="34">An ’ all the while his trade went down !</l>
       <l n="35">That trade what poor old Aaron tended</l>
       <l n="36">It 's fell to nowt an ’ can n't be mended</l>
       <l n="37">Coz businesses is all the same</l>
       <l n="38">You 've simply got to play the game</l>
       <l n="39">With all your soul an ’ all your heart</l>
       <l n="40">Or else you 'll soon be in the cart .</l>

       <l n="48">O'most as cute as lawyers be ,</l>
       <l n="49">Not quite — a course coz noa one could —</l>
       <l n="50">But very nigh — just as they should .</l>
       <l n="51">Parsons is sound at heart , I say ,</l>
