      <l n="37">All ignorant that soul that sees thee without wonder ;</l>
      <l n="38">Which is to me some praise , that I thy parts admire :</l>
      <l n="39">Thy eye Jove 's lightning seems , thy voice his dreadful thunder ,</l>
      <l n="40">Which ( not to anger bent ) is music and sweet fire .</l>

      <l n="45">When Cytherea , all in love forlorn ,</l>
      <l n="46">A longing tarriance for Adonis made ,</l>
      <l n="47">Under an osier growing by a brook ,</l>
      <l n="48">A brook where Adon used to cool his spleen .</l>
      <l n="49">Hot was the day ; she hotter that did look</l>
      <l n="50">For his approach , that often there had been .</l>
      <l n="51">Anon he comes , and throws his mantle by ,</l>
      <l n="52">And stood stark naked on the brook 's green brim ;</l>

      <l n="57">Fair is my love , but not so fair as fickle ;</l>
      <l n="58">Mild as a dove , but neither true nor trusty ;</l>
      <l n="59">Brighter than glass , and yet , as glass is , brittle ;</l>
      <l n="60">Softer than wax , and yet , as iron , rusty :</l>

      <l n="66">Dreading my love , the loss thereof still fearing !</l>
      <l n="67">Yet in the midst of all her pure protestings ,</l>
      <l n="68">Her faith , her oaths , her tears , and all were jestings .</l>

      <l n="69">She burn 'd with love , as straw with fire flameth ;</l>
      <l n="70">She burn 'd out love , as soon as straw outburneth ;</l>
      <l n="71">She fram 'd the love , and yet she foil 'd the framing ;</l>
      <l n="72">She bade love last , and yet she fell a turning .</l>
      <l n="73">Was this a lover , or a lecher whether ?</l>
