   <p>THE PRINTER TO THE GENTLE READER .</p>
   <p>Since my late setting foorth of the Faerie Queene , finding that it hath found a favourable passage amongst you , I have sithence endevoured by all good meanes , ( for the better encrease and accomplishment of your delights ,) to get into my handes such smale poemes of the same Authors as I heard were disperst abroad in sundrie hands , and not easie to bee come by by himselfe ; some of them having bene diverslie imbeziled and purloyned from him , since his departure over sea . Of the which I have by good meanes gathered togeather these fewe parcels present , which I have caused to bee imprinted altogeather , for that they al seeme to containe like matter of argument in them , being all complaints and meditations of the worlds vanitie , verie grave and profitable . To which effect I understand that he besides wrote sundrie others , namelie : Ecclesiastes and Canticum Canticorum translated , A Senights Slumber , The Hell of Lovers , his Purgatorie , being all dedicated to ladies , so as it may seeme he ment them all to one volume : besides some other pamphlets looselie scattered abroad ; as The Dying Pellican , The Howers of the Lord , The Sacrifice of a Sinner , The Seven Psalmes , &amp; c ., which , when I can either by himselfe or otherwise attaine too , I meane likewise for your favour sake to set foorth . In the meane time , praying you gentlie to accept of these , and graciouslie to entertaine the new Poet *, I take leave .</p>
   <note>* Spenser had printed nothing with his name before the Faerie Queene .— Ponsonby 's account of the way in which this volume was collected is rather loose . The Ruins of Time and The Tears of the Muses were certainly written shortly before they were published , and there can be equally little doubt that Mother Hubberd 's Tale was retouched about the same time .

    <head>THE RUINES OF TIME .</head>
    <head>DEDICATED</head>
    <head>TO THE RIGHT NOBLE AND BEAUTIFULL LADIE ,</head>
    <head>THE LA : MARIE ,</head>
    <head>COUNTESSE OF PEMEBROOKE .</head>
    <head>Most honourable and bountifull Ladie , there bee long sithens deepe sowed in my brest the seede of most entire love and humble affection unto that most brave knight , your noble brother deceased ; which , taking roote , began in his life time somewhat to bud forth , and to shew themselves to him , as then in the weakenes of their first spring ; and would in their riper strength ( had it pleased High God till then to drawe out his daies ) spired forth fruit of more perfection . But since God hath disdeigned the world of that most noble spirit which was the hope of all learned men , and the patron of my young Muses , togeather with him both their hope of anie further fruit was cut off , and also the tender delight of those their first blossoms nipped and quite dead . Yet , sithens my late cumming into England , some frends of mine , which might much prevaile with me , and indeede commaund me , knowing with howe straight bandes of duetie I was tied to him , as also bound unto that noble house , of which the chiefs hope then rested in him , have sought to revive them by upbraiding me , for that I have not shewed anie thankefull remembrance towards him or any of them , but suffer their names to sleep in silence and forgetfulnesse . Whome chieflie to satisfie , or els to avoide that fowle blot of unthankefulnesse , I have conceived this small Poeme , intituled by a generall name of The Worlds Ruines ; yet speciallie intended to the renowming of that noble race from which both you and he sprong , and to the eternizing of some of the chiefe of them late deceased . The which I dedicate unto your La . as whome it most speciallie concerneth , and to whome I acknowledge my selfe bounden by manie singular favours and great graces . I pray for your honourable happinesse , and so humblie kisse your handes .</head>

   <p>Ver 491 .— These allegorical representations of the vanity of exalted position , stately buildings , earthly pleasures , bodily strength , and works of beauty and magnificence , admit of an easy application to the splendid career of the Earl of Leicester ,— his favor and influence with the Queen , his enlargement of Kenilworth , his princely style of living , and particularly ( IV . ) his military command in the Low Countries . The sixth of these “ tragick pageants ” strongly confirms this interpretation . The two bears are Robert and Ambrose Dudley . While Leicester was lieutenant in the Netherlands , he was in the habit of using the Warwick crest ( a bear and ragged staff ) instead of his own .

   <p>Ver 590 .— This second series of pageants is applicable exclusively to Sir Philip Sidney . The meaning of the third and fourth is hard to make out ; but the third seems to have reference to the collection of the scattered sheets of the Arcadia , and the publication of this work by the Countess of Pembroke , after it had been condemned to destruction by the author . The fourth may indeed signify nothing more than Lady Sidney 's bereavement by her husband 's death ; but this interpretation seems too literal for a professed allegory . The sixth obviously alludes to the splendid obsequies to Sidney , performed at the Queen 's expense , and to the competition of the States of Holland for the honor of burying his body . C .</p>

Vouchsafe , noble Lady , to accept this simple remembrance , though not worthy of your self , yet such as perhaps by good acceptance thereof ye may hereafter cull out a more meet and memorable evidence of your own excellent deserts .

    <head>FOOTNOTES :</head>
    <head>MOTHER HUBBERDS TALE . This charming little poem , Spenser 's only successful effort at satire , is stated by the author to have been composed in the raw conceit of his youth . There is internal evidence , however , that some of the happiest passages were added at the date of its publication , at which time the whole was probably retouched . Although Mother Hubberds Tale is in its plan an imitation of the satires of Reynard the Fox ; the treatment of the subject is quite original . For the combination of elegance with simplicity , this poem will stand a comparison with Goethe 's celebrated translation of the Reineke . C .</head>

My person I wot wel how little worth it is .

    <head>VISIONS OF BELLAY . *</head>
    <note>* Eleven of these Visions of Bellay ( all except the 6th , 8th , 13th , and 14th ) differ only by a few changes necessary for rhyme from blank-verse translations found in Van der Noodt 's Theatre of Worldlings , printed in 1569 ; and the six first of the Visions of Petrarch ( here said to have been “ formerly translated ” ) occur almost word for word in the same publication , where the authorship appears to be claimed by one Theodore Roest . The Complaints were collected , not by Spenser , but by Ponsonby , his bookseller , and he may have erred in ascribing these Visions to our poet . C .</note>

    <head>MARQUESSE OF NORTH HAMPTON . [*]</head>
    <head>I have the rather presumed humbly to offer unto your Honour the dedication of this little poeme , for that the noble and vertuous gentlewoman of whom it is written was by match neere alied , and in affection greatly devoted , unto your Ladiship . The occasion why I wrote the same was as well the great good fame which I heard of her deceassed , as the particular goodwill which I bear unto her husband , Master Arthur Gorges , a lover of learning and vertue , whose house , as your Ladiship by marriage hath honoured , so doe I find the name of them , by many notable records , to be of great antiquitie in this realme , and such as have ever borne themselves with honourable reputation to the world , and unspotted loyaltie to their prince and countrey : besides , so lineally are they descended from the Howards , as that the Lady Anne Howard ; eldest daughter to John Duke of Norfolke , was wife to Sir Edmund , mother to Sir Edward , and grandmother to Sir William and Sir Thomas Gorges , Knightes : and therefore I doe assure my selfe that no due honour done to the White Lyon , but will be most gratefull to your Ladiship , whose husband and children do so neerely participate with the bloud of that noble family . So in all dutie I recommend this pamphlet , and the good acceptance thereof , to your honourable favour and protection . London , this first of Ianuarie , 1591 . Your Honours humbly ever .</head>

    <head>AMORETTI . [*]</head>
    <note>* These Sonnets furnish us with a circumstantial and very interesting history of Spenser 's second courtship , which , after many repulses , was successfully terminated by the marriage celebrated in the Epithalamion . As these poems were entered in the Stationers ’ Registers on the 19th of November , 1594 , we may infer that they cover a period of time extending from the end of 1592 to the summer of 1594 . It is possible , however , that these last dates may be a year too late , and that Spenser was married in 1593 . We cannot be sure of the year , but we know , from the 266th verse of the Epithalamion , that the day was the feast of St. Barnabas , June 11 of the Old Style . In the 74th sonnet we are directly told that the lady 's name was Elizabeth . In the 61st , she is said to be of the “ Brood of Angels , heavenly born . ” From this and many similar expressions , interpreted by the laws of Anagram , and taken in conjunction with various circumstances which do not require to be stated here , it may be inferred that her surname was Nagle .

    <p n="5">To the Worshipfull , his very singular good friend , Maister G. H ., Fellow of Trinitie Hall in Cambridge . * [* Reprinted from “ Ancient Critical Essays upon English Poets and Poesy . Edited by Joseph Haslewood ” . Vol II ]</p>
    <p n="6">GOOD MAISTER G .:—</p>
    <p n="7">I perceiue , by your most curteous and frendly letters , your good will to be no lesse in deed than I alwayes esteemed . In recompence wherof , think , I beseech you , that I wil spare neither speech , nor wryting , nor aught else , whensoeuer and wheresoeuer occasion shal be offred me ; yea , I will not stay till it be offred , but will seeke it in al that possibly I may . And that you may perceiue how much your counsel in al things preuaileth with me , and how altogither I am ruled and ouer-ruled thereby , I am now determined to alter mine owne former purpose , and to subscribe to your advizement ; being , notwithstanding , resolued stil to abide your farther resolution . My principal doubts are these . First , I was minded for a while to haue intermitted the vttering of my writings ; leaste by ouer-much cloying their noble eares , I should gather a contempt of myself , or else seeme rather for game and commoditie to doe it , for some sweetnesse that I haue already tasted . Then also me seemeth the work too base for his excellent lordship , being made in honour of a priuate personage vnknowne , which of some ylwillers might be vpbraided , not to be so worthie as you knowe she is ; or the matter not so weightie that it should be offred to so weightie a personage , or the like . The selfe former title still liketh me well ynough , and your fine addition no lesse . If these and the like doubtes maye be of importaunce , in your seeming , to frustrate any parte of your aduice , I beeseeche you without the leaste selfe loue of your own purpose , councell me for the beste : and the rather doe it faithfullye and carefully , for that , in all things , I attribute so muche to your iudgement , that I am euermore content to adnihilate mine owne determinations in respecte thereof . And , indeede , for your selfe to , it sitteth with you now to call your wits &amp; senses togither ( which are alwaies at call ) when occasion is so fairely offered of estimation and preferment , For whiles the yron is hote it is good striking , and minds of nobles varie , as their estates . Verum ne quid durius .</p>
    <p n="8">I pray you bethinks you well hereof , good Maister G ., and forth with write me those two or three special points and caueats for the nonce ; De quibus in superioribus illis mellitissimus longissimisque litteris tuis . Your desire to heare of my late beeing with hir Maiestie muste dye in it selfe . As for the twoo worthy gentle men , Master Sidney and Master Dyer , they haue me , I thanke them , in some vse of familiarity ; of whom and to whome what speache passeth for youre credite and estimation I leaue your selfe to conceiue , hauing alwayes so well conceiued of my vnfained affection and zeale towardes you . And nowe they haue proclaimed in their [ Greek : hareiophaga ] a generall surceasing and silence of balde rymers , and also of the verie beste to ; in steade whereof they haue , by authoritie of their whole senate , prescribed certaine lawes and rules of quantities of English sillables for English verse ; hauing had thereof already greate practise , and drawen mee to their faction . Newe bookes I heare of none , but only of one * [* Stephen Gosson . ] , that writing a certaine booke called The Schoole of Abuse , and dedicating it to Maister Sidney , was for hys labor scorned ; if , at leaste , it be in the goodnesse of that nature to scorne . Such follie is it not to regard aforehande the inclination and qualitie of him to whome wee dedicate oure bookes . Suche mighte I happily incurre , entituling My Slomber , and the other pamphlets , vnto his honor . I meant them rather to Maister Dyer . But I am of late more in loue wyth my Englishe versifying than with ryming : whyche I should haue done long since , if I would then haue followed your councell . Sed te solum iam tum suspicabar cum Aschamo sapere ; nunc aulam video egregios alere poetas Anglicos . Maister E. K . hartily desireth to be commended vnto your worshippe : of whome what accompte he maketh youre selfe shall hereafter perceiue by hys paynefull and dutifull verses of your selfe .</p>
    <p n="9">Thus muche was written at Westminster yesternight ; but comming this morning , beeyng the sixteenth of October<span type="note_anchor">[ 1579 ]</span>, to Mystresse Kerkes , to haue it deliuered to the carrier , I receyued youre letter , sente me the laste weeke ; whereby I perceiue you otherwhiles continue your old exercise of versifying in English ,— whych glorie I had now thought whoulde haue bene onely ours heere at London and the court .</p>
    <p n="10">Truste me , your verses I like passingly well , and enuye your hidden paines in this kinde , or rather maligne and grudge at your selfe , that woulde not once imparte so muche to me . But once or twice you make a breache in Maister Drants rules : quod tamen condonabimus tanto poetae , tuaeque ipsius maximae in his rebus autoritati . You shall see , when we meete in London , ( whiche when it shall be , certifye vs ,) howe fast I haue followed after you in that course : beware , leaste in time I ouertake you . Veruntamen te solum sequar , ( vt saepenumero sum professus ,) nunquam sane assequar dum viuam . And nowe requite I you with the like , not with the verye beste , but with the verye shortest , namely , with a few Iambickes . I dare warrant , they be precisely perfect for the feete , ( as you can easily iudge ,) and varie not one inch from the rule . I will imparte yours to Maister Sidney and Maister Dyer , at my nexte going to the courte . I praye you keepe mine close to your selfe , or your verie entire friendes , Maister Preston , Maister Still , and the reste .</p>
    <p n="11">Iambicum Trimetrum</p>
    <p n="12">Vnhappie Verse , the witnesse of my vnhappie state , Make thy selfe fluttring wings of thy fast flying Thought , and fly forth vnto my love whersoeuer she be :</p>
    <p n="13">Whether lying reastlesse in heauy bedde , or else Sitting so cheerelesse at the cheerfull boorde , or else Playing alone carelesse on hir heauenlie virginals .</p>
    <p n="14">If in bed , tell hir , that my eyes can take no reste ; If at boorde , tell hir , that my mouth can eate no meate ; If at hir virginals , tel hir , I can heare no mirth .</p>
    <p n="15">Asked why ? say , Waking loue suffereth no sleepe ; Say , that raging loue dothe appall the weake stomacke ; Say , that lamenting loue marreth the musicall .</p>
    <p n="16">Tell hir , that hir pleasures were wonte to lull me asleepe ; Tell hir , that hir beautie was wonte to feede mine eyes ; Tell hir , that hir sweete tongue was wonte to make me mirth .</p>
    <p n="17">Nowe doe I nightly waste , wanting my kindely reste ; Nowe doe I dayly starue , wanting my liuely foode ; Nowe doe I alwayes dye , wanting thy timely mirth .</p>
    <p n="18">And if I waste , who will bewaile my heauy chaunce ? And if I starue , who will record my cursed end ? And if I dye , who will saye , This was Immerito ?</p>
    <p n="19">I thought once agayne here to haue made an ende , with heartie Vale , of the best fashion ; but loe , an ylfavoured mys chaunce . My last farewell , whereof I made great accompt , and muche maruelled you shoulde make no mention thereof , I am nowe tolde , ( in the diuel 's name ,) was thorough one mans negligence quite forgotten , but shoulde nowe vndoubtedly haue beene sent , whether I hadde come or no . Seing it can now be no otherwise , I pray you take all togither , wyth all their faults : and nowe I hope you will vouchsafe mee an answeare of the largest size , or else I tell you true , you shall bee verye deepe in my debte ; notwythstandyng thys other sweete but shorte letter , and fine , but fewe verses . But I woulde rather I might yet see youre owne good selfe , and receiue a reciprocall farewell from your owne sweete mouth .</p>

Cuncta vijs sic apta meis : ego solus ineptus . Nam mihi nescio quo mens saucia vulnere , dudum Fluctuat ancipiti pelago , dum navita proram Inualidam validus rapit huc Amor , et rapit illuc Consilijs Ratio melioribus vsa , Decusque Immortale leui diffissa Cupidinis arcu *: [* This line appears to be corrupt . ] Angimur hoc dubio , et portu vexamur in ipso .

Tantum amor , et mulier , vel amore potetitior .

Ludit Aristippum modo tetrica turba sophorum , Mitia purpureo moderantem verba tyranno ; Ludit Aristippus dictamina vana sophorum , Quos leuis emensi male torquet Culicis vmbra : Et quisquis placuisse studet heroibus altis , Desipuisse studet ; sic gratia crescit ineptis . Denique laurigeris quisquis sua tempora vittis Insignire volet , populoque placere fauenti , Desipere insanus discit , turpemque pudendae Stultitiae laudem quaerit .

Nec tu , pace tua , nostri Cato Maxime saecli , Nomen honorati sacrum mereare poetae , Quantumvis illustre canas , et nobile carmen , Ni stultire velis ; sic stultorum omnia plena .

Little newes is here stirred , but that olde greate matter still depending . His Honoure neuer better . I thinke the earthquake wyth you ( which I would gladly learne ) , as it was here with vs ; ouerthrowing diuers old buildings and peeces of churches . Sure verye straunge to be hearde of in these countries , and yet I heare some saye ( I knowe not howe truely ) that they haue knowne the like before in their dayes . Sed quid vobis videtur magnis philosophis ? I like your late Englishe hexameters so exceedingly well , that I also enure my penne sometime in that kinde : whyche I fynd , indeede , as I haue heard you often defende in worde , neither so harde nor so harshe , that it will easily and fairely yeelde it selfe to oure moother tongue . For the onely or chiefest hardnesse whych seemeth is in the accente , whyche sometime gapeth , and as it were yawneth ilfauouredly , comming shorte of that it should , and sometime exceeding the measure of the number ; as in carpenter , the middle sillable being vsed shorte in speache , when it shall be read long in verse , seemeth like a lame gosling , that draweth one legge after hir : and heauen , beeing vsed shorte as one sillable , when it is in verse , stretched out with a diastole , is like a lame dogge that holdes vp one legge . But it is to be wonne with custome , and rough words must be subdued with vse . For why , a God 's name , may not we , as else the Greekes , haue the kingdome of oure owne language , and measure our accents by the sounde , reseruing the quantitie to the verse ? Loe , here I let you see my olde vse of toying in rymes , turned into your artificiall straightnesse of verse by this tetrasticon . I beseech you tell me your fancie , without parcialitie .</p>
    <p n="29">See yee the blindefolded pretie god , that feathered archer , Of louers miseries which maketh his bloodie game ? Wote ye why his moother with a veale hath coouered his face ? Trust me , least he my looue happely chaunce to beholde .</p>
    <p n="30">Seeme they comparable to those two which I translated you ex tempore in bed , the last time we lay togither in Westminster ?</p>
    <p n="31">That which I eate , did I ioy , and that which I greedily gorged ; As for those many goodly matters leaft I for others .</p>
    <p n="32">I would hartily wish you would either send me the rules and precepts of arte which you obscrue in quantities , or else followe mine , that M. Philip Sidney gave me , being the very same which M. Drant deuised , but enlarged with M. Sidneys own iudgement , and augmented with my obseruations , that we might both accorde and agree in one ; leaste we ouerthrowe one an other , and be ouerthrown of the rest . Truste me , you will hardly beleeue what greate good liking and estimation Maister Dyer had of your Satyricall Verses , and I , since the viewe thereof , hauing before of my selfe had speciall liking of Englishe versifying , am euen nowe aboute to giue you some token what and howe well therein I am able to doe : for , to tell you trueth , I minde shortely , at conuenient leysure , to sette forth a booke in this kinde , whyche I entitle , Epithalamion Thamesis , whyche booke I dare vndertake wil be very profitable for the knowledge , and rare for the inuention and manner of handling . For in setting forth the marriage of the Thames , I shewe his first beginning , and offspring , and all the countrey that he passeth thorough , and also describe all the riuers throughout Englande , whyche came to this wedding , and their righte names and right passage , &amp; c .; a worke , beleeue me , of much labour , wherein notwithstanding Master Holinshed hath muche furthered and aduantaged me , who therein hath bestowed singular paines in searching oute their firste heades and sourses , and also in tracing and dogging onto all their course , til they fall into the sea .</p>
    <p n="33">O Tite , siquid ego , Ecquid erit pretij ?</p>
    <p n="34">But of that more hereafter . Nowe , my Dreames and Dying Pellicane being fully finished ( as I partelye signified in my laste letters ) and presentlye to bee imprinted , I wil in hande forthwith with my Faery Queene , whyche I praye you hartily send me with al expedition : and your frendly letters , and long expected judgement wythal , whyche let not be shorte , but in all pointes suche as you ordinarilye vse and I extraordinarily desire . Multum vale . Westminster . Quarto Nonas Aprilis , 1580 . Sed , amabo te , meum Corculum tibi se ex animo commendat plurimum : iamdiu mirata , te nihil ad literas suas responsi dedisse . Vide quaeso , ne id tibi capitale sit : mihi certe quidem erit , neque tibi hercle impune , vt opinor . Iterum vale , et quam voles soepe . Yours alwayes , to commaunde , IMMERITO .</p>
    <p n="35">Postcripte .</p>
    <p n="36">I take best my Dreames shoulde come forth alone , being growen , by meanes of the Glosse ( running continually in maner of a paraphrase ) , full as great as my Calendar Therin be some things excellently , and many things wittily , discoursed of E. K ., and the pictures so singularly set forth and purtrayed , as if Michael Angelo were there , he could ( I think ) nor amende the beste , nor reprehende the worst . I knowe you woulde lyke them passing wel . Of my Stemmata Dudleiana , and especially of the sundry apostrophes therein , addressed you knowe to whome , muste more aduisement be had , than so lightly to sende them abroade : howbeit , trust me , ( though I doe never very well ,) yet , in my owne fancie , I neuer dyd better : Veruntamen te sequor solum ; nunquam vero assequar .</p>
    <p n="37">Extract from Harvey 's Reply .</p>
    <p n="38">But Master Collin Cloute is not euery body , and albeit his olde companions , Master Cuddy &amp; Master Hobbinoll , be as little be holding to their Mistresse Poetrie as euer you wist , yet he peraduenture , by the meanes of hir speciall fauour , and some personall priuiledge , may happely line by Dying Pellicanes , and purchase great landes and lordshippes with the money which his Calendar and Dreames haue and will affourde him . Extra iocum , I like your Dreames passingly well ; and the rather , bicause they sauour of that singular extraordinarie veine and inuention whiche I euer fancied moste , and in a manner admired onelye in Lucian , Petrarche , Aretine , Pasquill , and all the most delicate and fine conceited Grecians and Italians , ( for the Romanes to speake of are but verye ciphars in this kinde ,) whose chiefest endeuour and drifte was to haue nothing vulgare , but , in some respecte or other , and especially in liuely hyperbolicall amplifications , rare , queint , and odde in euery pointe , and , as a man woulde saye , a degree or two , at the leaste , aboue the reache and compasse of a common scholars capacitie . In whiche respecte notwithstanding , as well for the singularitie of the manner as the diuinitie of the matter , I hearde once a diuine preferre Saint Iohns Reuelation before al the veriest metaphysicall visions and iolliest conceited dreames or extasies that euer were deuised by one or other , howe admirable or super excellent soeuer they seemed otherwise to the worlde . And truely I am so confirmed in this opinion , that when I bethinke me of the verie notablest and moste wonderful propheticall or poeticall vision that euer I read , or hearde , meseemeth the proportion is so vnequall , that there hardly appeareth anye semblaunce of comparison : no more in a manner ( specially for poets ) than doth betweene the incomprehensible wisedome of God and the sensible wit of man . But what needeth this digression betweene you and me ? I dare saye you wyll holde your selfe reasonably wel satisfied , if youre Dreames be but as well esteemed of in Englande as Petrarches Visions be in Italy ; whiche , I assure you , is the very worst I wish you . But see how I haue the arte memoratiue at commaundement . In good faith , I had once again nigh forgotten your Faerie Queene : howbeit , by good chaunce , I haue nowe sent hir home at the laste , neither in better nor worse case than I founde hir . And must you of necessitie haue my iudgement of hir indeede ? To be plaine , I am voyde of al iudgement , if your nine Comoedies , whervnto , in imitation of Herodotus , you giue the names of the nine Muses , ( and in one mans fansie not vnworthily ) , come not neerer Ariostoes comoedies , eyther for the finesse of plausible elocution or the rarenesse of poetical inuention , than that Eluish Queene doth to his Orlando Furioso ; which , notwithstanding , you wil needes seeme to emulate , and hope to ouergo , as you flatly professed yourself in one of your last letters . Besides that , you know , it hath bene the vsual practise of the most exquisite and odde wittes in all nations , and specially in Italie , rather to shewe and aduaunce themselues that way than any other ; as , namely , those three notorious dyscoursing heads , Bibiena , Machiauel , and Aretine , did , ( to let Bembo and Ariosto passe ,) with the great admiration and wonderment of the whole countrey : being , in deede , reputed matchable in all points , both for conceyt of witte and eloquent decyphering of matters , either with Aristophanes and Menander in Greek , or with Plautus and Terence in Latin , or with any other in any other tong . But I wil not stand greatly with you in your owne matters . If so be the Faerye Queeue be fairer in your eie than the nine Muses , and Hobgoblin runne away with the garland from Apollo , marke what I saye : and yet I will not say that I thought , but there an end for this once , and fare you well , till God or some good aungell putte you in a better minde .</p>
