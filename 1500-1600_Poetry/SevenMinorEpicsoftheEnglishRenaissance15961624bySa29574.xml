    <head>INTRODUCTION</head>
    <p n="1">Professor Elizabeth Story Donno , in her recent = Elizabethan Minor Epics = ( New York , 1963 ) , has made an important contribution to both scholarship and teaching . Not only has she brought together for the first time in one volume most of the extant Elizabethan minor epics , but in so doing , she has hastened the recognition that the minor epic , or “ epyllion ” as it has often been called in modern times ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>is a distinctive literary genre as deserving of study as the sonnet , the pastoral , or the verse satire .</p>
    <p n="2">The purpose of the present volume is to supplement and complement Professor Donno 's collection by making available in facsimile seven minor epics of the English Renaissance omitted from it . With the publication of these poems all the known , surviving minor epics of the Elizabethan and Jacobean periods will for the first time be made available for study in faithful reproductions of the earliest extant editions .</p>
    <p n="3">Of the seven minor epics included here , three —= A Pleasant and Delightfull Poeme of Two Lovers , Philos and Licia =, = STC = 19886 ( 1624 ) ; Dunstan Gale 's = Pyramus and Thisbe =, = STC = 11527 ( 1617 ) ; and S [ amuel ] P [ age 's ] = The Love of Amos and Laura = ( 1613 )[ 2 ] — have not previously been reprinted in modern times . And of these three , one , = Philos and Licia =, though listed in the = Short-Title Catalogue =, seems not to have been noticed by Renaissance scholars , nor even by any of the principal bibliographers except William C. Hazlitt , who gives this unique copy bare mention as a book from Robert Burton 's collection .<span type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span></p>
    <p n="4">The remaining four books — R [ ichard ] L [ ynche 's ][ 4 ] = The Amorous Poeme of Dom Diego and Ginevra = published with Lynche 's = Diella , Certaine Sonnets =, = STC = 17091 ( 1596 ) ; William Barksted 's = Mirrha The Mother of Adonis : Or , Lustes Prodegies =, = STC = 1429 ( 1607 ) , published with = Three Eglogs = by Lewes Machin ; Barksted 's = Hiren : or The Faire Greeke =, = STC = 1428 ( 1611 ) ; and H. A 's = The Scourge of Venus , or , The Wanton Lady . With the Rare Birth of Adonis =, = STC = 968 ( 1613 ) — have been edited by the “ indefatigable ” Alexander B. Grosart in = Occasional Issues of Very Rare Books = ( Manchester , 1876-77 ) , limited to 50 copies each and hence extremely scarce today .<span type="note_anchor">[ 5 ]</span>= Dom Diego and Ginevra = was also reprinted by Edward Arber in = An English Garner =, VII ( Birmingham , 1883 ) , 209-240 . With the exception of = Philos and Licia =, these poems are printed in their approximate order of composition from 1596 to 1613 .<span type="note_anchor">[ 6 ]</span></p>
    <p n="5">AUTHORSHIP</p>
    <p n="6">As befits the paucity of their known literary productions , the authors of these poems have in common chiefly their anonymity , or a degree of obscurity approaching it . The authors of = Philos and Licia = and of H. A 's = The Scourge = are unknown . Though the authors of the other poems are known , little is known about them . The mystery of the authorship of = The Scourge = was compounded in the nineteenth century by its incorrect attribution to one Henry Austin . Grosart , for example , argued that the H. A. on the title page and on the address “ To the Reader ” of the 1614 impression , and the A. H. on the corresponding pages of the 1620 impression , = STC = 970 , was the Austin denounced by Thomas Heywood for stealing his translations of Ovid 's = Ars Amatoria = and = De Remedio Amoris =. Arthur Melville Clark , in correcting this error , pointed out that these stolen translations of Ovid should not be confused with = The Scourge =, an original poetic composition based on Book X of a quite different work by Ovid , = The Metamorphoses =. Clark concluded that “ H. A. or A. H. was probably the editor , not the author , although he may have made certain corrections and additions , as the title-page of the second edition states . "[ 7 ]</p>
    <p n="7">However , H . A .— not A. H .— was almost certainly the author of = The Scourge =, as evidenced , among other details , by the title page of the 1613 = Scourge =,<span type="note_anchor">[ 8 ]</span>unknown to Clark , which unequivocally states : “ Written by = H . A .= ” As to the initials H. A. appended to the address “ To the Reader ” of the 1614 impression and the A. H. on the title and address pages of the 1620 impression , they were probably printer 's errors , arising in the 1614 impression from the printer 's careless assumption that the address “ To the Reader ” was the work of the author rather than the bookseller , and in the impression of 1620 from a simple typographical metathesis of the letters H and A .<span type="note_anchor">[ 9 ]</span></p>
    <p n="8">The authorship of the remaining five poems , together with such relevant facts of the authors ’ lives as are known , is as follows . = Pyramus and Thisbe = is by one Dunstan Gale ( fl . 1596 ) , about whom nothing else is known . = Dom Diego and Ginevra = has long been attributed to Richard Lynche ( fl . 1601 ) , otherwise chiefly known for his = Diella =, a conventional sonnet sequence accompanying = Dom Diego =, and for his translation of Cartari 's = Le Imagini =, Englished as = The Fountaine of Ancient Fiction = ( 1599 ) . = Mirrha = and = Hiren = are by William Barksted ( fl . 1611 ) , “ one of the servants of his Majesties Revels , ” as the title page of = Hiren = proclaims . Barksted is believed to have completed = The Insatiate Countess = after Marston 's withdrawal from the stage in 1608 or 1609 . This play , bearing Barksted 's name in one issue of the 1631 edition , contains a number of lines and phrases identical with lines and phrases in = Mirrha = and = Hiren =.<span type="note_anchor">[ 10 ]</span></p>
    <p n="9">= Amos and Laura = has been attributed , probably correctly , to Samuel Page ( 1574-1630 ) ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 11 ]</span>who is mentioned by Meres as “ most passionate among us to bewaile and bemoane the perplexities of Love ,"[ 12 ] and by his fellow-Oxonian Anthony à Wood as long-time Vicar of Deptford .<span type="note_anchor">[ 13 ]</span>Although a few additional facts are known about these authors , none seems to contribute to an understanding of the poems reprinted , and all may be found under the appropriate authors ’ names in the = DNB =.</p>

   <head>SOURCES</head>
   <p>Traditionally the storyhouse of minor epic source materials has been classical mythology , but inevitably , as suitable classical myths were exhausted , Renaissance poets turned to such sources as the Italian novella , or even — romantic heresy — to comparatively free invention . As if to compensate for these departures from orthodoxy , the later epyllionists leaned ever more heavily on allusions to classical mythology . Of the seven poems included here only three (= Pyramus and Thisbe , Mirrha , and The Scourge =) are based on a classical source ( Ovid 's = Metamorphoses =) . Of the remaining four tales , two are drawn from Bandello apparently by way of Painter , and the last two (= Philos and Licia , Amos and Laura =) , though greatly indebted to = Hero and Leander = overall , seem not to have drawn their characters or actions directly from either a classical or more contemporary source . These last two poems , then , from a Renaissance point of view , are comparatively free inventions . But both , and especially = Philos and Licia =, are a tissue of allusions to classical mythology .</p>
   <p>Gale in = Pyramus and Thisbe = expands Golding 's translation of Ovid 's = Metamorphoses =, IV , from some 130 to 480 lines , Barksted expands less than 300 lines of Golding 's = Ovid =, X , to nearly 900 , and H. A. enlarges the same tale to about 950 lines .<span type="note_anchor">[ 14 ]</span>It should be emphasized , however , that these are not mere amplified translations , but reworkings of the classics , with significant departures from them . Gale , for example , prefaces the romance of Pyramus and Thisbe with their innocent meeting out-of-doors in an arbor , amid violets and damask roses . He has Venus , enraged at seeing these youngsters engaging in child-like rather than erotic play , command Cupid to shoot his arrows at them “ As nought but death , their love-dart may remove ” ( Stanza 8 ) . There is no counterpart to this opening scene in Golding 's Ovid .</p>
   <p>Similarly Barksted departs at length from Ovid in the beginning of his tale , where the Renaissance poet undertakes to explain why Mirrha is cursed with love for her father . While she listens to the sweet , sad songs of Orpheus , Cupid ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 15 ]</span>falling in love with her , courts her and is rejected ; his parting kiss “ did inspire / her brest with an infernall and unnam 'd desire ” ( p. 123 ) . Golding 's Ovid , specifically denying that Cupid had anything to do with Mirrha 's unnatural love , suggests that Cinyras ’ daughter must have been blasted by one of the Furies .<span type="note_anchor">[ 16 ]</span>Other inventions of Barksted include a picture of her father with which Mirrha converses ( pp . 126-127 ) , pictures of her suitors ( p. 128 ) , a picture of her mother , over which she throws a veil ( p. 128 ) and a description of Mirrha herself ( pp . 131-132 ) . Later in the story Mirrha meets a satyr named Poplar ( unknown to Ovid ) , who makes free with her ( pp . 148-155 ) . As punishment for such goings on in Diana 's sacred grove , he is to be metamorphosed into the tree that now bears his name ( even as Mirrha is subsequently transformed into the tree that produces myrrh ) .</p>
   <p>= The Scourge of Venus =, though following Ovid 's story more closely than = Mirrha =, expands Golding by more than 600 lines , to a little more than the average length of the Elizabethan minor epic . In the process , Mirrha is assigned lustful dreams not found in Ovid ( p. 246 ) , and is impelled to write a long letter to her father ( pp . 247-250 ) . Shortly thereafter , the author introduces an emphatically Christian digression on the horror of Mirrha 's “ fowle incestious lust ” and on the importance of reading =" Gods holy Bible "= as a salve for sin ( p. 253 ) , and invents the Nurse 's prolix arguments against such “ filthy ” love as Mirrha desires ( pp . 258-261 ) .<span type="note_anchor">[ 17 ]</span>The fact that the author follows Ovid 's story as closely as he does should be taken as a commentary on his limited powers of invention rather than on his devotion to the art of translation .</p>

     <l n="4">Ginevra =.<span type="note_anchor">[ 19 ]</span>Grosart regarded Fenton 's work , 1579 , as the source from</l>
     <l n="5">which Lynche got the bare bones of his story , and Arber agreed .<span type="note_anchor">[ 20 ]</span></l>
     <l n="6">But though Jeannette Fellheimer could find no evidence that Lynche</l>
     <l n="7">knew Belleforest 's or Fenton 's version of the tale , she demonstrated ,</l>
     <l n="8">on the basis of two very close parallels , that he knew Painter 's .<span type="note_anchor">[ 21 ]</span></l>
     <l n="9">In support of Fellheimer 's view , one notes that Lynche follows Painter</l>
     <l n="10">in employing the form “ Cathelo [ y ] gne "[ 22 ] ( p. 63 ) rather than Fenton 's</l>
     <l n="11">“ Catalonia . "[ 23 ]</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Barksted may have known ballads on the subject of Hiren , alluded to in stanza 34 of his poem , as well as Peele 's lost play = The Turkish Mahomet and Hyren the fair Greek =. But like Lynche , he seems heavily indebted to a tale by Painter , in this case “ Hyerenee the Faire Greeke . "[ 24 ] Among other equally striking but less sustained correspondences between Painter 's prose narrative and Barksted 's minor epic verse , one notes the following , in which Mahomet 's confidant Mustapha attempts to reanimate his leader 's martial spirit , drowned in uxoriousness : “ But nowe I cannot revive the memorie of your father Amurate , but to my great sorow and griefe , who by the space of XL . yeres made the sea and earth to tremble and quake ... [ and so cruelly treated the Greeks ] that the memorie of the woundes do remaine at this present , even to the mountaines of Thomao and Pindus : he subjugated ... all the barbarous nations , from Morea to the straits of Corinthe . What neede I here to bring in the cruel battell that he fought with the Emperour Sigismunde and Philip duke of Burgundia wherein he overthrew the whole force of the Christians , toke the emperour prisoner , and the duke of Burgundie also ... or to remember other fierce armies which he sent into Hungarie . "[ 25 ]</p>
   <p>Barksted versifies this speech in stanzas 1 and 2 , putting it at the beginning instead of toward the end , where it comes in Painter 's novella . By a poetic license , Barksted credits all these achievements to the son , none to the father . Barksted follows Painter 's story quite closely , but he cuts , amplifies and invents in order to develop its minor epic potentialities . Thus , in addition to turning Painter 's prose into the sixains of Shakespeare 's = Venus and Adonis =, he cuts the length of Painter 's tale by about two-thirds . In the process , much of Painter 's attention to historical detail , his complication of plot , and his tedious moralizing are mercifully lost . By way of amplification in the minor epic mode , Barksted expands as follows Mahomet 's brief command in Painter that Hiren should “ adorne herselfe with her most precious jewels , and decke her with the costliest apparell shee had ” ( see stanza 100 ) .<span type="note_anchor">[ 26 ]</span>Also , in order to bring out Mahomet 's realization of the enormity of his crime of slaying Hiren , the consummation of all his amorous dreams , Barksted invents a second killing — Mahomet 's killing of Mustapha , who had driven his lord to perform the first execution .</p>
   <p>FORMAL CHARACTERISTICS</p>
   <p>Like the poems reprinted by Professor Donno , these establish their identity as minor epics by the erotic subject matter of their narration , however symbolized or moralized , and by their use of certain rhetorical devices that came to be associated with the genre . These include the set description of people and places ; the = suasoria =, or invitation to love ; and the formal digression , sometimes in the form of an inset tale , such as the tale of Poplar in = Mirrha = ( pp . 148-155 ) . Other rhetorical devices cultivated in the epyllion are the long apostrophe , and the sentence or wise saying . Also , these poems employ numerous compound epithets and far-fetched conceits . ( Dom Diego goes hunting with a “ beast-dismembring blade ” [ p. 64 ] , and Cinyras incestuous bed in = The Scourge = “ doth shake and quaver as they lie ,/ As if it groan 'd to beare the weight of sinne . ” [ p. 271 ] . )</p>
   <p>The average length of these , like other Renaissance minor epics , is about 900 lines . Although the length of Renaissance minor epics is not rigidly prescribed , it is noteworthy that several of these poems have almost the same number of lines . = Philos and Licia =, = Mirrha =, and = Hiren =, for example , running to about 900 lines , vary in length by no more than 16 lines . (= Amos and Laura =, however , the shortest with about 300 lines , is some 650 lines shorter than = The Scourge =, the longest , with about 950 . )</p>
   <p>As well as echoing Marlowe 's = Hero and Leander = and Shakespeare 's = Venus and Adonis = in particular words and phrases , these poems reveal a much more general indebtedness to what Professor Bush has aptly called “ the twin peaks of the Ovidian tradition in England . "[ 27 ] The majority employ one of two prosodic patterns — the Marlovian couplet popularized in = Hero and Leander =, or the six-line stanza used by Lodge but soon after taken over by Shakespeare in = Venus and Adonis = and thereafter associated with his poem .<span type="note_anchor">[ 28 ]</span></p>
   <p>In addition to the couplet , a common mark of Marlovian influence in the poems is the etiological myth , sometimes expanded into a tale . Thus , in = Mirrha =, for instance , the growth of rare spices and perfumes in Panchaia is explained by the story of how Hebe once spilled nectar there ( p. 147 ) .</p>
   <p>Comparable marks of Shakespearean influence are the aggressive female like Mirrha , reminiscent of Shakespeare 's Venus ; the hunting motif in = Dom Diego = and = Amos and Laura =, recalling Adonis ’ obsession with the hunt ; and the catalog of the senses in = Philos and Licia =, pp . 15-16 , and = Hiren =, stanzas 75-79 , which imitates Shakespeare 's = Venus and Adonis =, ll . 427-450 . Only = Mirrha = among these poems , however , makes specific acknowledgment of a debt to Shakespeare ( see p. 177 ) . Finally , Dom Diego 's plangent laments at Ginevra 's cruelty recall Glaucus ’ unrestrained weeping at Scylla 's cruelty in Lodge 's = Scillaes Metamorphosis =. But whereas the “ piteous Nimphes ” surrounding Glaucus weep till a “ pretie brooke ” forms ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 29 ]</span>“ the fayre = Oreades = pitty-moved gerles ” that comfort Dom Diego are loath to lose the “ liquid pearles ” he weeps . Consequently they gather ( and presumably preserve ) them with “ Spunge-like Mosse ” ( p. 95 ) . Lynche extends his debt to Lodge by establishing at the end of his poem a link between Ginevra and the Maiden he professes to love . But , whereas Lodge in the Envoy to his poem uses Scylla on the rocks as a horrible example of what may happen to unyielding maids , Lynche holds up Ginevra , who finally marries her lover , as an example to be followed by the poet 's disdainful Diella of the accompanying sonnets ( see p. 101 ) .</p>
   <p>It would probably be impossible , even if it were desirable , for any given minor epic to follow all the conventions of the genre , or even all its alternative conventions . Yet all the poems included here adhere so closely to most of the important minor epic conventions that there should be no question as to the minor epic identity of any .<span type="note_anchor">[ 30 ]</span></p>
   <p>THE HISTORY OF THE EARLY EDITIONS</p>
   <p>= Philos and Licia =, though entered on October 2 , 1606 and presumably printed soon thereafter , survives only in the unique copy of the 1624 edition printed by W. S. [ William Stansby ? ] for John Smethwick . ( No record of transfer of this poem from William Aspley , who entered it , exists , though Aspley and Smethwick were associated , along with William Jaggard , in the publication of Shakespeare 's First Folio of 1623 . )</p>
   <p>Robert Burton bequeathed this copy of = Philos and Licia =, along with many of his other books , to the Bodleian Library in 1639 . Under the terms of his will the Bodleian was to have first choice of his books , unless it already had duplicates , and Christ Church , Burton 's college , second choice . Along with = Philos and Licia =, the Bodleian received the following other minor epics from Burton 's collection : = Pigmalion 's Image = ( 1598 ) , = Venus and Adonis = ( 1602 ) , = Samacis and Hermaphroditus = ( 1602 ) , and = Hero and Leander = ( 1606 ) .<span type="note_anchor">[ 31 ]</span>Burton regularly wrote his name in full , some abbreviation thereof , or at least his initials , on the title page of his books , usually across the middle . In = Philos and Licia =, Burton 's heavily and distinctively written initials RB are written a bit below the middle of the title page , on either side of the printer 's device .<span type="note_anchor">[ 32 ]</span>Also in its typical location at the bottom of the title page is found “ a curious mark , a sort of hieroglyphic or cypher , ” which Burton almost always affixed to his books . The significance of this device remains obscure ; it “ has usually been supposed to represent the three ‘ R 's ’ in his name joined together . "[ 33 ]</p>
   <p>Although the dedication of Dunstan Gale 's = Pyramus and Thisbe = is dated November 25 , 1596 , no copy of an earlier edition than that printed in 1617 for Roger Jackson is extant . The unsophisticated , highly imitative style of the piece , the date of the dedication , and the fact that the printer 's device in the 1617 edition is an old one , used previously in 1586-87 by Ralph Newbery ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 34 ]</span>to whom Jackson was apprenticed from 1591-99 ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 35 ]</span>suggests that the poem was originally published by Newbery about 1596 . Probably this first edition had the same device as the edition of 1617 , and a similar title page . According to Newbery 's will , Roger Jackson and John Norcott were to receive his stock of books on Fleet Street , but McKerrow , citing the Prerogative Court of Canterbury , 30 , Hudlestone as his authority , says the offer seems not to have been taken up .<span type="note_anchor">[ 36 ]</span>Gale 's poem would seem to constitute an exception to this generalization .</p>
   <p>= Pyramus and Thisbe = was also issued with Greene 's = Arbasto = in 1617 . On Jan. 16 , 1625 / 26 Gale 's poem was transferred from Roger Jackson 's widow to Francis Williams ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 37 ]</span>who had it printed for the last time in 1626 .</p>
   <p>Nothing of note has been turned up with regard to the first and only early edition of Lynche 's = Dom Diego and Ginevra = ( 1596 ) .</p>
   <p>According to their first modern editor , A . B. Grosart , the first and only early editions of = Mirrha = and = Hiren = are notorious for their wretched typography and printing errors of various kinds .<span type="note_anchor">[ 38 ]</span>He writes , “ In all my experience of our elder literature I have not met with more carelessly printed books . Typographical and punctuation errors not only obscure the meaning but again and again make places absolutely unintelligible . "[ 39 ] Their author Barksted must share the blame , Grosart opines , for some of the poem 's errors would seem to show that he was “ ill-educated and unpractised in composition . "[ 40 ] Henry Plomer agrees with Grosart that Edward Allde , the printer of = Mirrha =, was guilty of poor type and workmanship .<span type="note_anchor">[ 41 ]</span>Perhaps the grossest example in = Mirrha = of the kind of thing Plomer may have had in mind is the tipping of the type on the title page of the two copies of this poem which have come to my attention .<span type="note_anchor">[ 42 ]</span>Another example would be the awkward separation of the “ A ” in “ Adonis ” on one line of the title page from the rest of the word on the next .</p>
   <p>But although = Mirrha = is indeed a printer 's nightmare , it strikes me that Grosart is far too severe in his strictures against = Hiren =, which was quite attractively and reasonably accurately printed , probably by Nicholas Okes ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 43 ]</span>who also printed = The Scourge =. Indeed Grosart has “ corrected ” a number of details of punctuation in the poem which might better have been left standing , in view of the generally light punctuation of Barksted 's day . In two instances Grosart has even “ corrected ” details which , as “ corrected , ” follow the unique copy of = Hiren =, the Bodleian copy which he consulted .<span type="note_anchor">[ 44 ]</span></p>
   <p>Page 's = Amos and Laura = was first published in 1613 ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 45 ]</span>a second time in 1619 . Finally , in 1628 , a second impression of the edition of 1613 , with slight variants from it , was printed .</p>
   <p>In the nineteenth century = Amos and Laura = was remarked upon chiefly for its dedicatory verses to Izaak Walton in the unique copy of the 1619 edition at the British Museum , verses found neither in the then only known , imperfect British Museum copy of the 1613 edition , nor in the impression of 1628 . These verses have long been thought to constitute the first reference to Walton in print . But three additional copies of the 1613 edition have by now come to light , at the Folger , the Huntington , and at the British Museum .<span type="note_anchor">[ 46 ]</span>All three copies , though variously imperfect , contain the dedicatory verses .<span type="note_anchor">[ 47 ]</span></p>
   <p>A word remains to be said about the way in which the second impression of the 1614 = Scourge =, “ corrected , and enlarged , by H. A . ” differs from the first edition of 1613 . Though long thought to be identical with the first edition ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 48 ]</span>the second impression , besides being corrected in a number of details , is “ enlarged ” by the following two stanzas after the line on p. 262 , “ Helpe Nurse , else long I cannot live .

   <p>LITERARY VALUE</p>
   <p>Much of the literary value of these poems , it should be recognized , is historical . Like Henry Petowe 's romance , = The Second Part of Hero and Leander = ( 1598 ) , they are fully as interesting as reflections of the poetic genius of Marlowe and / or Shakespeare , mirrored in the works of their less gifted contemporaries , as they are in themselves . Apart from their historical significance , however , all these poems have intrinsic interest , and several , including = Dom Diego =, = Mirrha = and = Hiren = as well as = Philos and Licia =, have a considerable degree of literary merit as well . Whoever the author of Philos and Licia may have been , he was one who had thoroughly assimilated the conventions of the minor epic , especially those employed in = Hero and Leander =.<span type="note_anchor">[ 50 ]</span>Unlike Page , whose imitation of Marlowe is for the most part blind , this author is skillful in working many of these conventions , and even particular words and phrases from other minor epics , into the context of his poem , somewhat as the bards of major epic are supposed to have done . Surprisingly , in view of this technique of composition , the poem is well integrated , and consistently smooth and fluent in its versification .<span type="note_anchor">[ 51 ]</span></p>
   <p>As much as this unknown poet must have admired Marlowe 's verse , he evidently could not stomach the elder poet 's conception of a hostile universe , or his glorification of unwedded bliss . Accordingly he constructed in = Philos and Licia = a world in which all goes well provided one follows the rules , and where one of the key rules is that Hymen 's rites must precede love 's consummation . One of Licia 's chief responsibilities , in addition to summing up all feminine perfections , is to enforce this rule . Philos , though severely tempted to violate it , soon yields to Licia 's virtuous admonitions , for he is , let it be known , a pliant youth , almost as devoted to Licia 's will as the knight in Chaucer 's Wife of Bath 's tale to the Loathly Lady 's . The poem ends happily , with the gods attending the lovers ’ nuptials . The result of this too easily ordered union of souls and bodies , unhappily for this otherwise charming poem , is an insufficiency of conflict . Aside from the poem 's un-Marlovian insistence on matrimony , its most notable feature is its skillful and sustained use of light and dark imagery , recalling Chapman 's much less extensive treatment of such imagery in his conclusion of Marlowe 's poem and in Ovid 's = Banquet of Sense =.</p>
   <p>Gale 's = Pyramus and Thisbe = begins with a moderately engaging portrayal of the youngsters ’ innocent friendship ; it soon falls into absurdity , from which it never subsequently gets entirely clear . Gale seems to have had no inkling of the ridiculous possibilities of “ serious ” verse . Consequently , he is able to write of Pyramus and Thisbe “ sit [ ting ] on bryers ,/ Till they enjoyd the height of their desires , ” ( Stanza 13 ) , with no sense of the incongruity of the image employed . With similar ill effect in its pathetic context , Thisbe 's nose bleed is introduced as an omen of disaster ( Stanza 33 ) , and Pyramus ’ “ angry ” blood , by a ridiculously far-fetched conceit , is said to gush out “ to finde the author of the deed ,/ But when it none but = Pyramus = had found ,/ Key cold with feare it stood upon the ground ” ( Stanza 30 ) .</p>
   <p>= Dom Diego =, though a pleasant , occasionally charming imitation of Lodge 's = Scillaes Metamorphosis =, employs fewer of the epyllionic conventions than = Philos and Licia =, and uses them less imaginatively . Though it never achieves a style of its own , it is quite successful in recapturing the lachrymose artificiality that marks Lodge 's poem .</p>
   <p>Despite its oblique opening and occasionally awkward style , Barksted 's = Mirrha = is a poem of more power than = Dom Diego =. Among its more affecting passages are a vivid portrayal of a “ gloomy gallerie ” lined with portraits of Mirrha 's suitors ( p. 128 ) and an inventive account of Hebe 's spilling the nectar that rained spices on Panchaia ( p. 147 ) . Barksted 's early and unqualified recognition of Shakespeare 's greatness , and his humbly accurate assessment of his own limited powers , compared to “ neighbor ” Shakespeare 's , are quite disarming . One gets the uncomfortable sense , however , that Barksted in both = Mirrha = and = Hiren =, like H. A. in = The Scourge = after him , is a moral fence straddler , enjoying vicariously the lasciviousness he so piously reprehends .</p>
   <p>= Hiren = as treated by Barksted is also deficient in imagination of a high order , but is a more absorbing story than = Mirrha =. As signaled by his undertaking a more intricately rhymed stanza than he attempted in his first poem , Barksted 's versification and composition in the second poem are superior . The poet achieves his most telling effects in = Hiren = not from invention but from the elaboration of such source materials in Painter as permit him to capture the distinctive glittering artifice of minor epic . His catalog of the senses ( Stanzas 75-79 ) serves as an example of this power of embellishment at its best .</p>
   <p>Page 's = Amos and Laura =, like Gale 's = Pyramus and Thisbe =, falls into bathos near the end when Amos , in an extended comparison , likens Laura 's refusal to cure his love wound to an avaricious doctor 's refusal to set a poor man 's leg . Page 's failure as a poet is not a result of temporary lapses , as here , but of his inability to invent significant conflict . As Amos says , with unintentional irony on page 235 :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">There are no Seas to separate our joy ,</l>
     <l n="2">No future danger can our Love annoy .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>This is precisely the problem . But in spite of the poem 's obvious weakness , one is drawn to the man who wrote it for his obviously sincere , self-deprecatory references to his “ weake wit ” and “ inferiour stile . ” Fully aware of his limitations , Page , like Barksted and many another unexceptional talent of his age , was nevertheless drawn to the composition of poetry like a moth to the flame .</p>
   <p>= The Scourge = is a straightforward and lively but undistinguished redaction , in sing-song verse , of the well-worn Mirrha story . Its chief but nevertheless dubious merit , over against the epyllionic tradition , is its no-nonsense approach to the art of minor epic narration . Although it expands Ovid 's speeches and descriptions where feasible and introduces a degree of invention en route , it is singularly barren of such adornments as epithets , set descriptions , and formal digressions . In consequence , it lacks the distinctive hard , bejewelled brilliance of minor epic that characterizes Barksted 's poetry at its best .</p>
   <p>In summation , then , we see that although = Pyramus and Thisbe = and = Amos and Laura = have slight literary value , = The Scourge =, while failing to score very high as a minor epic , yet has a certain crude , narrative vitality . And = Dom Diego =, = Mirrha =, = Hiren =, and = Philos and Licia =, by virtue of their charm , inventiveness , or skillful adaptation of minor epic conventions to their expressive needs , form a hierarchy of increasing literary value that raises them as a group well above the level of the merely imitative .</p>
   <p>For permission to reproduce = Philos and Licia = ( for the first time ) , = Mirrha =, and = Hiren =, I am much indebted to the Bodleian Library ; for permission to reproduce = Dom Diego and Ginevra = I am similarly indebted to the Trustees of the British Museum . I am also under heavy obligation to the Folger Library for permission to reprint = Pyramus and Thisbe =, = Amos and Laura =, and = The Scourge of Venus = ( 1613 ) , all for the first time .</p>
   <p>I also wish to express my thanks to The British Museum , the Bodleian Library , the University of Michigan , and the Ohio State University libraries for generous permission to use their collections , and to the Board of College Education of the Lutheran Church in America for a six-week summer study grant , which enabled me to gather research materials for this project .</p>

My chief concern in this article was to show that the kind of poetry described therein , though in years past loosely and variously referred to by such terms as “ Ovidian poetry ” or “ mythological love poetry , ” and often lumped together indiscriminately with other kinds such as the complaint , the tragical history , and the verse romance , actually constitutes a distinct genre recognized in practice by Renaissance poets . Whether or not there is classical authority for use of the term “ epyllion , ” though a significant point of scholarship , is not the main issue here . Either the term “ minor epic ” or “ epyllion ” is satisfactory , provided its referent is clear , and accurately described .</p>

   </lg>
   <p>Gentlemen ; hauing beene ( with the ouerthrow giuen to my best opposed forces ) violently taken with the ouerflowing delights of hart-rauishing Poesie , the common infection of easie youth , and commending manie idle houres to these papers , and these to the Presse , I commit both to your fauorable censures . In which , if there be any thing ( yet I feare I am not to attend so high a blisfulnesse ) which may yeeld you the least content , my fortune hath brought forth the intended end of my labours , and I desire no other happinesse .</p>

     <l n="47">Vertuous Æneas , with the armes of Greece ,</l>
     <l n="48">Venturing for Troy as Iason for his fleece .</l>
     <l n="49">And vpward if you lookt , you might behold</l>
     <l n="50">The roofe of it all wrought in burnisht gold :</l>
     <l n="51">Whereon was figur 'd heauen ; and there anent</l>
     <l n="52">The Gods in state riding to Parliament .</l>
     <l n="53">Gold-showring Ioue vpon a milke-white steed</l>
     <l n="54">Rode first in ranke ; on whose imperiall head</l>

     <l n="59">But on his left , swift-winged Mercurie</l>
     <l n="60">A dreadfull thunderbolt ( earths feare ) did whurrie .</l>
     <l n="61">Next Ioue , Apollo came : him followed Fame</l>
     <l n="62">Baring a lawrell , on which sweet Sydneys name</l>
     <l n="63">In golden letters , plainly to be read ,</l>
     <l n="64">By the Nine Muses had beene charrectred :</l>
     <l n="65">On whose each side Eternitie and Praise</l>
     <l n="66">Enroll 'd mens deeds , and gaue them fame to raise .</l>

     <l n="70">Greeke-wounding Hector and Æneas held .</l>

     <l n="72">Brimfull of wine , next Mars his place did holde ;</l>
     <l n="73">The which quaft off , one reeling on before</l>
     <l n="74">Filled againe , and still supplied more .</l>
     <l n="75">Him followed sicknesse , by excesse , being lead ,</l>
     <l n="76">With faint weake hands holding his pained head .</l>
     <l n="77">Thus was the roofe adorn 'd : but for the bed ,</l>
     <l n="78">The which those sacred limmes encanaped ,</l>

     <l n="84">That I may write her worth , and tell thy glory .</l>
     <l n="85">Vpon her backe she lay ( ô heauenly blisse ! ) ;</l>
     <l n="86">Smiling like Ioue , being couzend of a kisse ;</l>
     <l n="87">The enuious pillow , which did beare her head ,</l>
     <l n="88">Was with it selfe at warre , and mutined :</l>
     <l n="89">For if the midst receiu 'd her chaste impression ,</l>
     <l n="90">Then the two ends would swell at such a blessing ;</l>
     <l n="91">And if she chanst to turne her head aside ,</l>
     <l n="92">Gracing one end with natures only pride ,</l>
     <l n="93">The rest for enuy straight would swell so much ,</l>

     <l n="95">Her Sun-out-shining eyes were now at set ,</l>
     <l n="96">Yet somewhat sparkling through their cabinet ;</l>
     <l n="97">Her scorne white forehead was made vp by nature ,</l>
     <l n="98">To be a patterne to succeeding creature</l>
     <l n="99">Of her admiring skill : her louely cheeke ,</l>

     <l n="105">Her sweetest breath from out those sweeter lips ,</l>
     <l n="106">Much like coole winde which from the valleys skips</l>
     <l n="107">In parching heat of Summer , stealeth forth ,</l>
     <l n="108">Wandring amongst her haire ; her wel formd mouth :</l>
     <l n="109">No art hath left vs such proportion ,</l>
     <l n="110">To modell out so true perfection .</l>
     <l n="111">Her smoothe moist hands the sheets kept from his sight ,</l>
     <l n="112">Lest by comparing , they should staine their white .</l>
     <l n="113">As thus she lay like Venus in her pride ,</l>

     <l n="115">Philos approcht , who with this sight strooke dumbe</l>

     <l n="117">His greedie eye , which on the sudden meets</l>
     <l n="118">So many various and delicious sweets ,</l>
     <l n="119">As rackt with pleasure ( neuer hauing fill )</l>
     <l n="120">Would faine looke off , and yet would looke on still .</l>
     <l n="121">Thus do we surfet on our sudden ioyes ,</l>
     <l n="122">And ranck-fed pleasure thus it selfe destroyes :</l>
     <l n="123">For when his eye doth light vpon her hand ,</l>
     <l n="124">He then protests , that that is whitenesse land ;</l>
     <l n="125">But when the whitenesse of her whiter brow</l>
     <l n="126">Doth steale his eye from thence , he sweareth now</l>
     <l n="127">Her brow is fellowlesse without all peere ;</l>
     <l n="128">When being snatcht off vnto her fairer haire ,</l>
     <l n="129">He vowes , the Sun , which makes trees burnisht gold ,</l>
     <l n="130">Is not so faire , nor glorious to behold :</l>
     <l n="131">The viewing the strains which through those cheeks appeare ,</l>
     <l n="132">And that pure whitenesse which triumpheth there ,</l>
     <l n="133">Mixt with those azure Saphire passing vaines ,</l>
     <l n="134">Which are insert like siluer running streames ,</l>
     <l n="135">Watring those golden apples of the brests ,</l>
     <l n="136">Where heauens delight &amp; earths contentment rests ,</l>
     <l n="137">His full-fed eye orecome with such excesse ,</l>
     <l n="138">Sweares and forsweares , denies and doth confesse :</l>
     <l n="139">Then doth he touch her lips , Natures rich treasure ,</l>
     <l n="140">And musing thinks which is the greatest pleasure</l>
     <l n="141">To kisse or see ; for to resolue which doubt ,</l>
     <l n="142">Againe he kisses , whence comes stealing out</l>
     <l n="143">So sweet a breath as doth confound his sence ;</l>
     <l n="144">For rarest obiects hurt with excellence :</l>
     <l n="145">Then doth he seise her hand with softest straine ,</l>
     <l n="146">Whose moist rebound doth easily detaine</l>
     <l n="147">A willing guest , who purposely could wish</l>
     <l n="148">Noother food , but such a well-grac't dish .</l>
     <l n="149">Whiles thus poore Philos kisses , feeles and sees ,</l>
     <l n="150">Heauen-staining Licia opes her sparkling eyes ,</l>

     <l n="157">Which office she to Philos had assign 'd ,</l>
     <l n="158">Because she had him alwayes most in mind :</l>

     <l n="160">The restlesse nights in drery languishment ,</l>
     <l n="161">Tumbling and tossing in his lothsome bed ,</l>
     <l n="162">To flie from griefe , yet that still followed .</l>
     <l n="163">Then rising vp , and running here and there ,</l>
     <l n="164">As if he could outrun or lose his care ;</l>
     <l n="165">But being vp , and finding no reliefe ,</l>
     <l n="166">Lookt in his heart , and there he found out griefe .</l>

     <l n="171">With that a floud of teeres gush out amaine ;</l>

     <l n="173">So that the hurt he meant to do his eies ,</l>
     <l n="174">Heart-murdring griefe resists , and it denies .</l>
     <l n="175">Whereat amazd , as one bereft of sence ,</l>

     <l n="522">Would much amaze the gazers to behold .</l>
     <l n="523">This starrie garment did she first put on ,</l>
     <l n="524">Which tooke light from her face as from the Sun .</l>
     <l n="525">Her mantle was of richest taffatie ,</l>
     <l n="526">Where Iupiter was seruing Danae ,</l>
     <l n="527">So liuely wrought by Vestaes chastest Nun ,</l>
     <l n="528">As much delighted the sweet lookers on .</l>
     <l n="529">Her stomacher was all with diamonds set ,</l>
     <l n="530">Ore which a fall was plac 'd with pearles with net ,</l>
     <l n="531">And at each pearle ( which seemd to darke the skie )</l>
     <l n="532">Hung glistring Rubies and rich Porpherie .</l>
     <l n="533">A bracelet all of pearle her hands did grace ;</l>
     <l n="534">For to her hands all orients are but base .</l>
     <l n="535">A scarfe of maiden-blush did seeme to hide her ,</l>
     <l n="536">Wherein Diana when Acteon spide her ,</l>
     <l n="537">Herselfe had wrought , looking with such disdaine ,</l>
     <l n="538">As witnest well his after-following paine ;</l>
     <l n="539">One end whereof had yong Leanders shape ,</l>
     <l n="540">When through the swelling main ( whose waues did gape )</l>
     <l n="541">He sought his chastest Hero , beating from him</l>
     <l n="542">The waues , which murmuring stroue for to com nere him :</l>
     <l n="543">And at the other , matchlesse Hero stood</l>
     <l n="544">Viewing Leander tossed by the flood ,</l>
     <l n="545">And how the churlish billowes beat that head</l>
     <l n="546">On which herselfe was so enamoured ;</l>
     <l n="547">Praying to Neptune , not to be so cruell ,</l>
     <l n="548">But to deliuer vp her dearest iewell :</l>
     <l n="549">To figure to the world whose shining eies</l>
     <l n="550">She set two diamonds of highest prise .</l>
     <l n="551">Vpon her head she ware a vaile of lawne ,</l>
     <l n="552">Eclipsing halfe her eyes , through which they shone</l>
     <l n="553">As doth the bright Sun , being shadowed</l>
     <l n="554">By pale thin clouds , through which white streaks are spred .</l>
     <l n="555">Poore Philos wondred why she staid so long ,</l>
     <l n="556">And oft lookt out and mus 'd she did not come .</l>
     <l n="557">What need she decke her selfe with art ( quoth he )</l>
     <l n="558">Or hide those beauties with her brauerie ,</l>
     <l n="559">Which addeth glory to the meanst attire ?</l>
     <l n="560">What if she went in her loose flagging haire ,</l>
     <l n="561">Spread at his full length , that the Easterne winde</l>
     <l n="562">Might tie loue-knots for Cupid to vntwinde ,</l>
     <l n="563">With some trasparent garment ore her skin ,</l>
     <l n="564">Through which her naked glory might be seene :</l>
     <l n="565">Then as Diana a hunting might she goe ;</l>
     <l n="566">But she nor needs her arrowes nor a bow :</l>
     <l n="567">For all the beasts that should but see her passe ,</l>
     <l n="568">With w [= o ] dring straight would leaue the perled grasse</l>
     <l n="569">And feed their eyes , while with her snowy hand</l>
     <l n="570">She take what beasts she please ; nor more command</l>
     <l n="571">Needs she to keepe them : for her iuory palme</l>
     <l n="572">Commandeth more than any iron chaine .</l>
     <l n="573">But now she 's come , at whose thrise radiant light</l>
     <l n="574">As all amazd he shunnes her glorious sight ,</l>
     <l n="575">Like those which long in darke , chance to espie</l>
     <l n="576">A candles glimmering , if it come but nie ,</l>
     <l n="577">Can not endure that weake and feeble shine ,</l>
     <l n="578">But straightway shut their dim and dazled eine .</l>
     <l n="579">No maruell then , though in great extasie</l>
     <l n="580">His spirits are , at glittring maiestie .</l>
     <l n="581">She feares the worst , and to her Louer skips ,</l>
     <l n="582">Claps his plumpe cheeks , and beats his corall lips ,</l>
     <l n="583">And seeing him fall breathlesse to the earth ,</l>
     <l n="584">She seeks with kisses to inspire his breath .</l>
     <l n="585">At last his eye-lids he vp heaues againe ,</l>
     <l n="586">And feeling her sweet kisses , gins to faine ;</l>
     <l n="587">Shuts his bright eyes , and stops his rosie breath ,</l>
     <l n="588">And for her kisses counterfeits his death .</l>
     <l n="589">With that poore Licia both her hands vpholds ,</l>
     <l n="590">And those let fall , her wofull armes enfolds ,</l>
     <l n="591">With cast vp eyes in labour with her teares ,</l>
     <l n="592">Which ioy did weep for woe to leaue those spheares</l>
     <l n="593">Which downe her face made paths vnto her necke ,</l>
     <l n="594">And setling there shewd like a carquenet ;</l>
     <l n="595">Anon she teares her haire , away it flings ,</l>
     <l n="596">Which twining on her fingers shewd like rings ;</l>
     <l n="597">Then she assayes to speake , but sighs and teares</l>
     <l n="598">Eats vp her words and multiplies her feares .</l>
     <l n="599">Why wert thou borne ( quoth she ) to die so soone ,</l>
     <l n="600">And leaue the world poore of perfection ;</l>
     <l n="601">Or why did high heauen frame thee such a creature ,</l>
     <l n="602">So soone to perish : ô selfe-hurting Nature ,</l>
     <l n="603">Why didst thou suffer death to steale him hence ,</l>
     <l n="604">Who was thy glory and thy excellence .</l>
     <l n="605">What are the Roses red , now he is gone ,</l>
     <l n="606">But like the broke sparks of a diamond ,</l>
     <l n="607">Whose scattred pieces shadow to the eye</l>

     <l n="612">To those dead flowers whose feruor now is spent ?</l>
     <l n="613">O starueling Death , thou ruiner of Kings ,</l>
     <l n="614">Thou foe to youth and beautie-sealed things ,</l>
     <l n="615">Thou friend to none but sepulchers and graues ,</l>
     <l n="616">High reared monuments , lasting Epitaphs ,</l>
     <l n="617">Poore Clearks &amp; Sextons , and some thriftlesse heires ,</l>

     <l n="625">He hearing this , from pleasing death reuiues ,</l>

     <l n="632">The flowrie fields and siluer streaming brooks ,</l>
     <l n="633">As Licia in his life was comforted ,</l>
     <l n="634">Whom new before she thought for to be dead :</l>
     <l n="635">She locks her fingers in his crisped haire ,</l>
     <l n="636">And pulles it out at length , which leauing there ,</l>

     <l n="638">To be a prisoner to hand so white :</l>
     <l n="639">And then she stroaks his alabaster skin ,</l>

     <l n="651">Which ere the bright Sun with his burning beame</l>
     <l n="652">Hath twice more coold his tresses in the maine ,</l>
     <l n="653">Shall be performd . This sayd , away he 's gone .</l>
     <l n="654">Farewell ( quoth she :) and at that word a groane</l>
     <l n="655">Waited with sighs and teeres , which to preuent ,</l>
     <l n="656">For feare his sweet heart she should discontent ,</l>
     <l n="657">Vnto her needle in all haste she goes ,</l>
     <l n="658">For to beguile her passions and her woes .</l>
     <l n="659">She first begins a smocke , of greater cost</l>
     <l n="660">Than Helen wore that night when as she lost</l>
     <l n="661">Her husbands fame and honour , and thereby</l>
     <l n="662">Had almost kept our now lost dignitie :</l>
     <l n="663">For Paris first , when as he came to bed ,</l>
     <l n="664">On that rich smocke was so enamoured ,</l>
     <l n="665">And so attentiuely beheld the same ,</l>
     <l n="666">That he forgot almost for what he came :</l>
     <l n="667">For on the coller and the seame before</l>
     <l n="668">Was big-bon 'd Hercules and the Minetaure ,</l>
     <l n="669">Both wrought so liuely , that the bloud which came</l>
     <l n="670">From that deformed beast , did seeme to staine</l>
     <l n="671">Her smocke below ; which running here and there</l>
     <l n="672">Workt in red silke , did new and fresh appeare ;</l>
     <l n="673">Which made yong Paris doubt , and thinke indeed</l>
     <l n="674">She was not well , and askt and she did bleed ;</l>
     <l n="675">And would needs see : but wide the curtains drawn ,</l>
     <l n="676">There was some iewell sparkled through the lawn ,</l>
     <l n="677">Which pleasd him so , that he had quite forgot</l>
     <l n="678">The curious working of the rich wrought smocke .</l>
     <l n="679">But loue-blest Licia in her smocke delights</l>
     <l n="680">To worke of pleasing tales and marriage rites ,</l>
     <l n="681">Of louers sweet stolne sports , and of the rapes</l>
     <l n="682">Of gods immortall , and of maidens scapes :</l>
     <l n="683">There might you see Mars conquering Venus shrowd ,</l>
     <l n="684">Sea-torne Æneas in a foggie cloud</l>
     <l n="685">Making for Carthage ; entring all vnseene</l>
     <l n="686">To the rich temple where the Tyrian Queene</l>

     <l n="688">Sate in her throne to heare the Troians cries .</l>
     <l n="689">Beneath this same she wrought a boistrous storme ,</l>
     <l n="690">Whereas the mercy-wanting winds had torne</l>
     <l n="691">The tops of loftie trees , and rent the roots</l>
     <l n="692">Of stately Cedars and of aged oakes :</l>
     <l n="693">The horrid thunder with his dreadfull claps</l>
     <l n="694">Made yawn the mouth of heauen , from whose great gaps</l>
     <l n="695">The fearefull lightning flasht : and then againe</l>
     <l n="696">Ioue squeesd the clouds , &amp; powrd down snow &amp; rain .</l>
     <l n="697">In this same storme she wrought the Tyrian Queene</l>
     <l n="698">And great Æneas , who that day had beene</l>
     <l n="699">Hunting the fallow deere , and thither came</l>
     <l n="700">To shrowd themselues from tempest and raine .</l>
     <l n="701">Into a bushie caue hard by they got ,</l>
     <l n="702">Which thicke set trees did couer ore the top ;</l>
     <l n="703">In which the Carthage Queene Æneas led ,</l>
     <l n="704">Who there deceiu 'd her of her maidenhead .</l>
     <l n="705">A scarfe besides she made of cunning frame ,</l>
     <l n="706">Whereas Alcides club and armour throwne ,</l>

     <l n="708">He grad the wheele at Omphales desire .</l>
     <l n="709">And all this night she banisht sleepe by worke ,</l>
     <l n="710">Who in her chamber priuily did lurke ,</l>
     <l n="711">Tempting her eye-lids to conspire with him ,</l>
     <l n="712">Who often times would winke and ope again :</l>
     <l n="713">But now bright Phoebus in his burning car</l>
     <l n="714">Visits each mortall eye and dimmes each star ,</l>
     <l n="715">The nights sole watch-man , when she casts aside</l>
     <l n="716">Her curious worke , and doth in haste prouide :</l>
     <l n="717">For the faire fountaine which not far off stands ,</l>
     <l n="718">Whose purling noise vpon the golden sands</l>
     <l n="719">Inuites each weary wandring passenger</l>
     <l n="720">To see and taste those streames which are so cleare .</l>
     <l n="721">The louing banks like armes seeme to embrace it ,</l>
     <l n="722">Vpon the which there grew ( the more to grace it )</l>
     <l n="723">All sorts of coloured flowers , which seemd to looke</l>
     <l n="724">And glasse themselues within that siluer brooke .</l>
     <l n="725">Plentie of grasse did euery where appeare ,</l>

     <l n="727">Which euer flourishing still a beautious greene ,</l>
     <l n="728">Shewd like the palace of the Summers Queene :</l>

     <l n="792">So wondrous beautie , such a louely face ,</l>
     <l n="793">An eye so liuely , such a cherrie lip ,</l>
     <l n="794">So white a belly and so strait a hip ,</l>
     <l n="795">So well shapt , faire , in euery part and lim ,</l>
     <l n="796">That Nature was in loue with making him .</l>
     <l n="797">This boy would oft resort vnto the Lawnes ,</l>
     <l n="798">To rouse the Satyres and the nimble fawnes ,</l>
     <l n="799">That he might chase them ; but the fearefull deere</l>
     <l n="800">Loue-taken by his presence , would not stirre :</l>
     <l n="801">So he was faine ( when he would haue some play )</l>
     <l n="802">Himselfe to run , and then they scud away</l>
     <l n="803">And follow him , and in the place he stands</l>
     <l n="804">Come lightly tripping for to licke his hands :</l>
     <l n="805">And if the lion chanst for to espie him ,</l>

     <l n="821">With light thin garments tuckt vp to the knees ,</l>
     <l n="822">Buskins about her legs , through which he sees</l>
     <l n="823">A skin so white , that neuer did his eie</l>
     <l n="824">Beholde so chaste , so pure , so sweet a die :</l>
     <l n="825">Her vpper bodies when he did beholde ,</l>

     <l n="837">A thousand amourous glances he doth throwe ,</l>
     <l n="838">And those recoild , seconds a thousands moe .</l>
     <l n="839">At last the boy being danted by her feature ,</l>
     <l n="840">Makes his speech prologue to so admir 'd a creature :</l>

     <l n="842">Ioues sweetest offpring , shew me but what place</l>
     <l n="843">Thou doest inhabit , where thy Temple stands ,</l>
     <l n="844">That I may offer with vnspotted hands</l>
     <l n="845">On thy deere Altar ; and vpon thy praise</l>
     <l n="846">Sing glorious hymnes and sweet tun 'd roundelays ;</l>
     <l n="847">But ô most happy if I were thy Priest ,</l>

     <l n="851">Or if nights gouernesse , the pale-fac 'd Moone ,</l>
     <l n="852">For thy sake would I were Endymion :</l>

   <p>And as you see a woman teeming young , bearing the growing burthen of her wounb : Missing the dainty she hath lookt for long , falls straight in pastionate sicknes pale &amp; dumb ( for seeing she hath lost it ) will not tell , for what she in this forced pastion fell . So when his hopes were lost , he would not say , what was the cause , but this to her did laye .</p>
   <p>Virgin beware that fire within thy brest , to Vesta dedicate do not expire : as she must warie be that is the best to keepe it , it is knowne no lasting fier . The fuell cold fruitelesse Virginitie , which if zeale blow not violent , wil so one die : This stricts a virgins life , and who but knowes , that loue and chastitie , were euer foes .</p>
   <p>And if ere loue assaile those virgins forts , those Iuory bulwarkes that defend your heart : Though he be king of sportes he neuer sports , when as he wounds , but playes the Tirants part And so much more he wil tri [= u ] ph oure thee , by how much thou contents his deitie : I know you to be chaste , but yet faire Mayd , if ere you loue youle finde what I haue sayd .</p>
   <p>Sir ( quoth she ) when I loue you shall be mine : but know the time , when you shall claime me your 's When as the fire extinct as Vestaes shrine : and Venus leaues to haunt the Papheon bowres , When men are perfect friendes Tigers at peace , Discord in heauen , and powers diuine doe cease , when Fortune sleeps &amp; the north star doth moue wh [= e ] Turtles leaue to mourne their mates , ile loue .</p>

   <p>Thou didst deceiue me Mirrha , when I saide , thou flew'st for feare , thou gau'st me cause to fear and I might iustlie haue this gainst thee laide , thou wentst t ’ auide by pathes that were so nere Who begin , ill most often end in ill , and she that doth her first pure youth so spill In lawles lust , though made a wife to one , Remaines like wax for each impression .</p>
   <p>But see the goodnesse of the Deities , who still with grace preuents our ill presage , This groue was hallow 'd to no Hiadres , but chast Diana , who with violent rage Discending from her towre of Christalline , To keepe the place still sacred and diuine : against her rites , brought with her thereupon white Poplar from the banckes of Acheron :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Then with a charme , that did her face eclips ,</l>
     <l n="2">And made her crescent quak , the iuice she powers</l>
     <l n="3">Vpon the Satirs face , and prophane lipps ,</l>
     <l n="4">which quickly ouer all his body showers ,</l>
     <l n="5">Her borrow 'd power of art being finished :</l>
     <l n="6">( Deriued from Phoebus as her light ) she saide ,</l>

   <p>Sleepe Poplar sleepe , that was the Satirs name , who had bin long a king within these woods , Since thou my sacred Groue , gan to prophane : a sleepe seize on thee , still as stigian floods , by Stix I vow the partiall destenies , Did they conspire , shold nere vnclaspe thin eies , hauing thus said , the Satire vanisht so , as mens prospect that from a mirrour goe .</p>
   <p>I thinke ( quoth she ) accursed is this place , for heere the man , for whome I sorrow now , Heedelesse Acteon with immodest face , saw all our naked and did ouer-vewe : As men rich iuells doe , thinking there lies yet some rare vertue hidden from their eyes : And euen there quoth shee , &amp; then did point , reuen'gd , I saw his hounds teare ioint from ioint .</p>
   <p>But since saies she , thou as a King didst reigne , and art a Trophey too of Dians power : Thus much the Goddesse of the floods doth deign to change thy shape , into a vertick flower . Then thrice three words , thrice striking charmed wood The ground did crannie , and there out of hand , appeared greene Poplar , younger then before , which bow 'd the head &amp; dyan did adore .</p>
   <p>The palefac 'd Mirrha sat like guiltie spright , fore the infernall iudge , yet did not see Diana great , for dull are mortalls sight , ( and all inuisible is chastitie ) But heard a voice as she was vanishing , saying defild maide , doost wonder at this thing ? O Mirrha ere my crescents beautie change , thou shalt be turn 'd into a shape as strange .</p>
   <p>With this the verdant new sprung Poplar plant ( moou 'd with the winde ) seemd to bow down the head as cheering Mirrha , who did comfort want being amaz 'd at what Diana saide , Hauing recouer 'd sence , she flies the place , For feare of Phebæs comming to the chace : to Saba land she hies , where all affraide , my muse shall sing the downfall of the Maide .</p>
   <p>Then first hung downe Poplar his heauie braine , for Mirrha 's losse , whose loue brought him that and for he once in woods a King did raigne , a crowne hee still wear 's , richly wrought with blew and yellow eke , as figures both of loue , Which Venus dropt downe him from aboue . Bacchus doth loue him , for in feasts of wine , he weares a poplar Garland mixt with vine .</p>
   <p>The leaden God of sleepe , on his iuice feede , the vertues of him , sundry doe declare : His suddain taste a heauinesse doth breede , and drownes in rest , sences opprest with care , In places farre remote , he loues to growe , and eke by rivers that runne thicke and slowe , where drowsilie this woodish demie God , with euerie gale of winde his head doth nod .</p>
   <p>Now to proceede after a small repose , that the accursed seede gan swell her wombe , wh [= e ] her drie brain , no more teares could expose she weayting for a sad and heauie dombe . For often men offending , still doe feare , Though Ioue be farre off , yet his iudgements nere downe would she sit , and so vnfolde her moane that Eccho sight hirs and forgot her owne .</p>

That I a monster-mother should be made , If soe , O ouer equall Gods , let Mirrha fade into some shape , worthy your high deuice , Pitty to me , would make Ioue seeme vnwise .</p>
   <p>Alter O Gods , death that is due to birth , nor let the dead repine , that I should see Eliziums blest shades , nor the men of earth annoided be with my impuritie , Let them enioy the fieldes , and learned Songes , Of hye brow 'd Orpheus , let the vnflesht thronges that haue deseru 'd this , and much more be glad , my starres , my double life , and fate , are sad .</p>
   <p>You wearyed race of Danans vnblest girles , In vaine leaue off your vnwomb 'd tubs to fill , &amp; with your teares that staynd ye Indyan pearles , Weepe out for Mirrha , and ere night you will at my sad story orebrim with your teares , Your whirle-poole vessells , which so many yeres return 'd no interest , if you well deplore , you'le drowne in teares , or labour so no more .</p>
   <p>C [= o ] clude my fate , quicke you eternall counsell , or else I feare the nere-erturned dead Clad in the fearefull shapes of night and hell , will rife before the general day be spred ; and hurrie me in flesh to Acheron , To taste hels torture both in soule and bone : Then blast me thunderer in righteous ire , and I like Semele wil meete thy fire .</p>
   <p>The Gods to her last wish was tractable . her tongue percullist twice was as she spake : aire was her voice , and Mirrha now not able , to thanke the Gods , her ioynts in sunder brake . Leaues were her locks , of golden haire bereau 'd , her armes long boughes , deem &amp; be not deceiu 'd tree gan she be , yet twixt her thing so staid , you could not say she was or tree or maide .</p>
   <p>First grew her hayre vp like the Summer Corne , or as a blazing starre whose streames rise vpward &amp; being changd , fell leaues , that vp were borne , by the rude windes , yet had you but haue heard You 'd sware , a sigh for Mirrha 's transmigration Had beene decreed by all the windie nation . and euerie Autume , since a thing moste rare , The falling leaues , resemble Mirrha 's haire .</p>
   <p>To barke her yuorie skin polisht congeald , each blew rig 'd current into melting sap , Her nailes to bolssome faire , &amp; what reueal 'd with accents sad , the babe yet in her lap . Her fingers twigs , her bright eyes turn 'd to gum , Buried on earth , and her owne selfe the toombe , her sences gone , yet this sence did she win , to aye relent , the horror of her sinne .</p>

   <note>THE LOVE OF AMOS AND LAVRA . written by S. P. LONDON Printed for Richard Hawkins , dwelling in Chancery-Lane : neere Sarieants-Inne . 1613 . TO MY APPROVED AND MVCH RESPECTED FRIEND , Iz : Wa : To thee thou more then thrice beloued friend , I too vnworthie of so great a blisse : These harsh tun 'd lines I here to thee commend , Thou being cause it is now as it is : For hadst thou held thy tongue by silence might , These had bene buried in obliuions night . If they were pleasing , I would call them thine , And disavow my title to the verse : But being bad , I needs must call them mine , No ill thing can be clothed in thy verse . Accept them then , and where I haue offended , Rase thou it out , and let it be amended . S. P. THE AVTHOR TO HIS BOOKE . Go little booke into the largest world , And blase the chastnes of thy maiden Muse : Regardles of all enuie on thee hurld , By the vnkindnes that the readers vse : And those that enuie thee by scruples letter , Bid them take pen in hand and make a better . THE LOVE OF Amos and Laura . In the large confines of renowned France There liu 'd a Lord , whom Fortune did aduance , VVho had a Daughter , Laura call 'd the faire ; So sweet , so proper , and so debonaire , That strangers tooke her for to be none other , Then Venus selfe , the God of Loues owne Mother . Not farre from thence was scituate a Towne , The Lord thereof a man of great renowne ; VVhom likewise Fortune blessed with a Sonne , Amos by name , so modest , ciuill , yong , And yet in sight so wondrous and so bold , As that therein he passed vncontroul 'd : So kinde to strangers , and so meeke to all ; Of comely grace , and stature somewhat tall . As the wide world not two such Impes affords , As were the off-springs of these happy Lords . Hunting he lou 'd , and therefore in a morne He shakes off sleepe ( for ease he laughes to scorne ) Before the sable Curtaines of the East Proclaim 'd the Sunnes approach vnto the west ; Or Tytan , Lordly Ruler of the morne , Had in his Chariot , left the night forlorne ; Or sounded sleepe to them , with whom ( men say ) It 's darksome night when we enioy the day : He brac 'd his Hounds , and striding o'er his Steed , Hope with a conquest did the youngster feed : VVhich done , he hyes him to a mighty wood , That ioyn 'd where Laura 's Fathers Pallace stood . Thither being come , a Bore he rais 'd , whose pace Did make our hunts-man loose his Hounds in chase : Ranging the woods , he light into a Groue , More pleasant farre then that where Venus stroue To win Adonis to her hearts desire , Moued by the burning zeale of sweet Loues fire . In this sweet Groue God Pan did keepe his Court , And summon 'd all the petty Gods resort , As Satyres , Nymphes , and others , to the same , VVhere all sing prayses vnto Laura 's name . Into this Groue ( neare to her chamber side ) ( To take the Ayre ) she comes forth ; soone espide Of the yong Hunts-man , who made haste vnto her , And thus the Nouice there beginnes to wooe her : Parragon of beauty , diuine , though earthly creature , And yet Celestiall in thy heauenly feature . This sodaine courting , and vnwelcome sight , Made her adde wings to feare , and to that , flight : He following after , caught her by the traine , That in a rage the Maide turn 'd backe againe , And did demaund why he without remorse , Durst cause her stay , against her will , by force . Mou 'd by the rosiate colour of thy face , ( VVherein consists ( quoth he ) all heauenly grace ) I was too bold , I must confesse indeede , To touch the seluage of thy sacred weede : For which my selfe Ile punish as thou wilt , VVith any paine , for my deserued guilt . Doe but pronounce the sentence of my death , These hands shall be the butchers of my breath : But since the merit of my fault 's no deeper , Oh let me be thy Prisoner , thou my Keeper ; So shall thine eyes be witnesse of the woe , VVhich for my bold offence Ile vndergoe . Pronounce thy sentence then . VVherwith she spake , You are your Crafts-man Sir : and there she brake . Yet turning backe , quoth she , ô would ‘ twere true , Your loue were firme to me , as mine to you ! And here she ceased : for when he came neare her , She was afraid that he would ouer-heare her . And art thou so vnwilling then , quoth hee , To doome the sentence which I aske of thee ? Perswade thy selfe it is thy purer minde That will not let thy heart proue so vnkinde : O would that minde were mine , to ioyne thy hart Eyther to end my life , or ease my smart . Loue is my sute . Nor hate is my reply , Quoth she . Quoth hee , I cannot court it I ; They which but view the error in my lookes , May finde I neuer learn 'd in Cupids bookes : But like a stone rough hewen from the rockes , And after polish 'd by the Masons knockes , The former shewes but base then in compare , So to my loue my speech disgraces are : For were my speech true patterne of my minde , Not as it doth , should't come , but farre more kinde , Like as the Marchant hearing of a losse , Is vvondrous sory for so great a crosse ; And after heareth by a true report , His goods are safely landed in the Fort , Cannot expresse the joy he doth conceiue : For why ? it doth his senses quite bereaue ; And yet with signe of sorrow blames th'euent , Although it seeme most plaine and euident . Or like a Ship toss 'd by tempestuous weather , Now here , then there ; now back againe , then thither That whirle-windes meeting ( roaring out aloud ) Make watry mountaines shew the ship each cloud : Then with such fury they descend the deepe , From top of triple-Cedar-mountaines steepe , As of the Seas rich orientall shew , Against their wils they take a counterview . So fares his minde , which tossed to and fro , Sometimes doth ioy , and other times is woe : Sometimes from depth ascends into the ayre , And though he hope , he hides it with despayre . So long with feruent zeale he mou 'd his sute , Onely for want of words his tongue was mute . “ VVhere true affection rules in hottest fires , “ Dumbe signes and tokens then shew mens desires : For what he thought he shew 'd , he could not vtter , Which made him oft when he shold speak to mutter . She that was wounded with the selfe-same dart , Reueal 'd with tongue that which she wisht with hart And fram 'd her answere , so much't could not grieue him , For ‘ twas a salue to wound and to relieue him . Say I could loue , quoth she , my milder minde , ( Vnlesse you further moue ) cannot vnkinde , Frame you an answere : for wee are by nature So much addicted to mans heauenly feature , That though your faults are great by your abuse , To blinde the same it is our womans vse . Then as thou found'st me , leaue me , if thou wilt ; That shall be all I render for thy guilt . Further I will not credit thy report : Farewell ; be gone , for I am mist in Court . With that shee flyes , and in her flight she leaues A well wrought Scarfe , which straight the winde vp heaues ; And proud of such a prise , they doe infer With their embassage vnto Jupiter , And there presented it : who , as ‘ twas right , Did make the windes returne't with swiftest flight , Vnto the place where Amos stood amazed At that which hapt , who like a mad-man gazed , Wondring what she by this illusion meant , When to allure him was her whole intent : But led in admiration most of all , At the rich Scarfe which from the Maide did fall . He viewes the worke , where finding of Apollo Chasing a Nymph , who swifter then a Swallow Flyeth his armes , for feare did lend her wings To flye from him which after her soone flings . Himselfe a foole he cals , that wanting skill , Being allur 'd , he had not knowne her will . Doubtfull , he feares offence committed to her , That he so rashly , gain'st her will , durst wooe her . To cleare himselfe of which offence he flyes , Resolu 'd to winne the Maide , or lose the prize , With prosperous hast . Oh may thy hast well speed , Whose wondrous loue did vertuously proceed : Not from the flames of filthy lusts desire , As was that Rome-borne Tarquins lustfull fire : But as vnspotlesse from that filthy thought , From that most hell-deseruing thing of nought , As euer heart lodg 'd in a loyall brest , Or tongue , vntaught to lye , euer exprest . But why doe I digresse the path I tread , Cloying your eares with that your eyes doe read ? Pardon my boldnesse , and giue eare a while To that , of him , which my inferiour stile Shall now expresse : though't not with honor stands , He thinkes one paire of legs worth twice two hands . The arrow swift sent from the sturdy bow , May be accounted ( to his flight ) but slow : At last he gain 'd the Court , to vvhich being come , It shew 'd like to the Pallace of the Sunne Describ 'd in Ouid : for in length and fairenesse , None might surpasse the workmanship and rarenes . Through which his way lies , &amp; he needs must passe , The pauement Marble vvas , the vvals of Glasse : VVhereunder vvas so liuely caru 'd the Story Of great Joues loue , his vvondrous vvorks , &amp; glory , VVith many others loue : vvhich to rehearse VVould adde a mighty volume to my Verse , Besides mine owne weake vvit : for I doe know it , He vvas a better workeman , then I Poet . Yet could not this abate the Louers pace : For he still holds the louely Maide in chase . Passing the Court , he comes into a greene , VVhich vvas in middest of the Pallace seene : Thorough the midst there ranne a pleasant Spring , On each side with a vvall of Bricke hemm 'd in , Onely in midst , a Stile ; beyond , a Plancke , VVhich for a Bridge did serue to eyther bancke . Ouer this Stile as Laura lightly skips , In her rent garment happily it slips , And held her there a while till hee came to her , VVhere once againe the Nouice gins to wwoe her . Flye not thy friend , our Maker vvilleth so , Things reasonlesse approue and vvish it so , If vvithout sense and reason all things then Obserue a better course then humane men , How sauage were we then offending so , Committing that vvhich vve offence doe know ? O were my tongue a second Orpheus Harpe , That to my loue I might allure thy heart ! Or vvere thy loue but equall vnto mine , Then vvould thou seeke his fauor vvho seeks thine ! Me thinkes vnkindnesse cannot come from thence , VVhere beauty raignes vvith such magnificence , I meane from thee , vvhom nature hath endow 'd VVith more then Art would vvillingly allow 'd : And though by nature you are borne most faire , Yet Art would adde a beautie to your share : But it being spotlesse doth disdaine receipt Of all vnpolish 'd painting counterfeit . Your beautie is a snare vnto our wayes , VVherein once caught , wee cannot brooke delayes ; VVhich makes vs oft through griefe of minde grow sad , Griefe follows grief , then malecontent &amp; mad . Thus by deniall doe you cause our woe , And then doe triumph in our ouer-throw . What is it to be fayre ? onely a vanitie , A fading blossome of no perpetuitie . Consider this : for beautie is a flower , Subiect to ill occasions euery hower ; It is a tenure holden as wee see Durante Dei placito , not in fee . Measure my Loue then , proue it by a tryall : Let me not languish still by your deniall . If in my suite I erre , as by mischance , Blame not my Loue but count it ignorance . The tongue is but an instrument of nought , And cannot speake the largenesse of the thought : For when the minde abounds , and almost breaketh , Then through abundance of the heart it speaketh : No man can speake but what he hath in minde , Then what I speake I thinke ; be not vnkinde Vnto your seruant , who obedience proffers , And makes firme loue the obiect of his offers . I will not boast of Parentage , or Lyne , For all are base , respecting thee diuine : Nor will I boast of wealth , or riches store , For in thy face consists all wealth , and more . Pure are my thoughts as skin betweene thy browes , And eke as chaste my speech , my oathes , &amp; vowes . Speake sweetest fayre , but one kinde word to me , How can alas that be offence in thee ? There was a Dame a moderne Poet sung , Hero by name , like thee , both faire and young : And both so faire , that you did others passe As farre as rarest Dyamonds common glasse . VVhom young Leander courted on a greene , A Maide so faire ( but thee ) was neuer seene . She granted loue , which he ( alas ) to gaine , To reape those ioyes , did crosse the brinish Maine . My loue to thee , I now compare to his ; Accounting danger , so requited , blisse . There are no Seas to separate our ioy , No future danger can our Loue annoy : Then grant to me what she denide not him ; If good in her , in thee it is no sinne . The Sunne hath shin 'd thus long , ô let not now The Sunne be darkened by thine angry brow . But rather let each looke a Comet be That may presage my happy destinie . I could to you a short discourse impart , That would relent the direst stony hart , VVer't not offence . It 's no offence quoth she . Then thus the same Ile briefely tell , quoth he : A poore old man by chance did breake his leg , And he was told where he was wont to beg , That such a Surgion ( telling of his name ,) If that he pleas 'd , could quickly cure the same . VVhich when he heard , to him for helpe he goes , And craues for Gods sake he would ease his woes . The Surgion greedy to haue coyne therefore , But finding none , he would not heale the sore : VVhich caus 'd the poore old man to keepe his bed , That he for want of helpe in time was dead . Alas poore soule ; ( quoth shee ) and did he dye ? VVould I were Iudge , or hee were such as I , I so would vse the Surgion , as that hee Should feele the griefe which he before did see . Thus you confesse your wrong to me sweet Maid , If you performe ( quoth he ) the vvords you said . I am the man , who wounded , seeke reliefe : And you , the causer of my endlesse griefe ; You are the Surgion , whom I vrge the more To cure the wound because you made the sore . Be not obdurate then , sith my disease Is quickly cured , if the Surgion please . And this I vow , water shall turne to fire , Huge massie mountaines to the clouds aspire ; The Sun shall leaue his course , the Moon her brightnes , Night turne to day , and day shall lose his lightnes ; Fishes shall flye , birds swimme ; and Hare shall hunt The Hound , which to pursue the Hare vvas wont : Ayre , Earth , Fire , VVater , all things which you view Shall change their natures , ere I turne from you : And longer then I breathe a loyall friend , Let me ( ô heauens ) endure a wicked end . Silence ( quoth she ) and here let cease thy sute , Cause of distrust in loue did make me mute : Aske why I yeelded in so short a season , Because I loue , that is a womans reason . Yet Maides are fearefull ; for by mens abuse , Courting is turned to a common vse , How is he held , that cannot in these dayes Fash'on his words to each fantasticke phrase ? VVhich makes vs oft with one word to debase Him from our bosomes , whom our hearts imbrace : And , as you men doe for a Prouerbe make it , That which we loue we oft say nay and take it . Delayes breede danger , wherefore what I said , And what agrees with Honour , and a Maid , I yeeld to thee , but yet on this condition , Thou shalt not dare t'attempt the least fruition Of my chaste thoughts , by drawing them aside , Before in wedlocke I am made thy Bride . This said ; shee to the Court , hee to his Hounds , Where they had slaine a Bore , whose bloud abounds : Glad of his prey , he hastneth home amaine , VVith short returne he comes to her againe , And hauing ioyn 'd themselues in Hymens bands , The sacred Priest vniteth heart and hands : They reape those ioyes which elder louers know , And thus my Tale doth end , thus ends their woe .</note>
   <note>FINIS . THE SCOVRGE OF VENVS . OR , The wanton Lady . WITH THE RARE BIRTH OF ADONIS . Written by H. A. LONDON Printed by Nicholas Okes dwelling neere Holborne-bridge . 1613 . To the Reader . Gentlemen , if your fancy will permit you to fauour this booke , I shall be thankfull , if not , I can but repent at the charge of the Impression , I meane but little gaine to my selfe , yet much pleasure to you , if it were my owne wit , and you condemne it , I should be ashamed of my publicke intrusion , but since it was the labour of a man wel-deseruing , forbeare open reprehending , for , as I haue heard , ‘ twas done for his pleasure , without any intent of an Impreßion ; thus much I excuse him that I know not , and commend that which deserueth well , if I be partiall , I pray patience . The Scourge of Venus . Whilst that the Sunne was climing vp in haste , To view the world with his ambitious eye . Faire Myrha ; yet alas , more faire then chaste . Did set her thoughts to descant wantonly ; Nay most inhumane , more then bad , or ill , As in the sequell you may reade at will . You that haue parents , or that parents be , Depart a space , and giue not eare at all To the foule tale that here shall vttered be : Some filthy shame let on all other fall , If possibly there can be any such , From nature to degenerate so much . O then with Ouid , I am wonderous glad That this small world of ours is put so farre From those that such incestious people had : So rest thou still in glory as a starre . That scorning thrusts from other nations quite , And in thy vertues doth thy selfe delight . And now faire Myrha in her youthly blood Doth on her father dote with fond desire . Each foule occasion is accounted good , That may increase her filthy lustfull fire . And as this shamefull matter wanted grace , So doubtfully she thus doth plead her case . Why should not Gods this loue of mine permit ? Or be offended with me for the same ? It doth infringe their sacred lawes no whit , Adding dishonour , or deseruing blame . I will proceed , good reasons for to proue , ‘ Tis not vnlawfull to obtaine my loue . In many countries I do certaine know , The parents with their children married be , Which they do most , their godlinesse to show , Because their loues increast thereby they see . Then shal this lucklesse plot of ground remaine , Th'occasion that my loue I not obtaine ? Each night hath Nature set at liberty : All things be c [= o ] mon , for she naught restrains : Then let the Daughter with the Father lye , Like president with all things else remaines . The Kid , the Heifer , and the birds we see , Affect the same of whom they gotten be . In happy case then such her creatures are , That may do so , and yet do no offence , They be more happy then is mankinde farre : For they by some malicious base pretence Haue made a curbe to hold that still in thrall Which Nature would haue common vnto all . But yet packe hence thou foule incestious loue , What , wilt vpon thy only father dote ? I ought to loue him ; yet as doth behoue , Not that the world therby my shame may note . O do resolue ! the neerenesse of our kin , Cuts off all hope thy wished suit to win . Did Cupid then ere shoot so yet before ? Can Vulcan forge so foule an arrow now ? Or further : will dame Venus euermore Such cruelty vnto her seruants show ? No , no , I am deceiu 'd ; for now I see , With poisoned snakes some fury wo [= u ] ded thee . How great ( said she ) ô Venus mayst thou be , How was I rauished this present night , In feeling of your pleasant sports in me ? I clipt a man in prime of his delight , What liuely pleasures did I there conceiue ? No fault ( alasse ) but they too soone did leaue . Would Cynarus thou hadst some other name , How fitly mightst thou haue a loue of me ? How nobly mightst thereby increase thy fame , How quickly shouldst a son gaine vnto thee ? I would inforce dull earthly thoughts , to craue , To kisse and clip , and other pastimes haue . What meane my dreams ? haue they effect at all ? May dreames a future chance to vs portend ? Let then to me such dreames more oft befall , In dreames no present witnesse can offend . In dreames we may as great a pleasure take , As in some sort is found we being awake . But yet avaunt , packe hence foule filthy fire , Wring out some teares to quench this cursed flame No otherwise the daughter-like require Thy fathers loue , that blazons on thy shame . Yet put the case he first did seeke to me ; No doubt I should to his request agree . Why should it not then stand right so with him , Since of one nature we participate ? What if with speech thou chance his loue to win Then maist thou write , No time is yet too late . What thou dost blush to speake , loue bids thee write Belieue me they read more th [= e ] we indite . Resolu 'd on this , with trembling hand she takes The pen and paper , framing for to write , Left h [= a ] d holds way , whilst right the leter makes Composing what she did in minde indite . She writes , she doubts , she chageth this for that , She likes , dislikes , &amp; notes she knows not what . She casts away , and doth begin anew , Yet findes a want in that she framed last She blots , &amp; then againe that thing doth view , And now the first more fits then all that 's past . Father she writes , yet shame did blot it out , Then thus she writes , and casts away all doubt . I know not what , sends to I know not whom Such health that thou maist only giue to me , Which if I want , my life cannot be long , Euen that same health thy louer sends to thee . I dare not tell thee who I am for shame , Nor ( out alasse ) once let thee heare my name . And if thou aske of me what I desire , Or why so doubtfull I do write to thee , Would namelesse I might tell what I require , Till that my sweet were granted vnto me : Which if to know , thou wouldst make further triall A maiden asketh but a maids deniall . In token of my wounded heart , I would Within these blotted lines there might apeare My colour pale , my body leane and cold , My watery eyes , my sighes and heauy cheere , Then mightst perceiue I were in loue with thee , And how the flames of loue tormenteth me . I call the Gods as witnesse to the same Poore wretched wench , I stroue to flie the dart And did my best that out-rage for to tame Which Cupid had alotted for my smart , No wench bare more then did to me betide , Which forc 'd me shew the cause that I would hide . Then mercy at thy gentle hands I craue , In fearefull wise to thee I make my mone , Thou onely maist thy louer spill or saue , No enemy doth sue , but such a one That is aly 'd most sweetly vnto thee , Yet in a neerer band would linked be . My life is thine , and thou didst giue it me , Then loue thy selfe and thou wilt me affect , My beauty 's much , and is deriu 'd from thee , Then all thy owne be carefull to respect . O stop thy eares , and heare not Myrha 's name , And shut thy eies wh [= e ] thou dost read the same . My youthfull yeares rash folly doth beseeme , The skill of law to aged folkes belong , And all is lawfull that we list , I deeme , We take no notice of the right or wrong , If it offend to take thy owne i n't bed , Let that offence be layd vpon my head . Then set apart the dread of worldly shame , And take the Gods , as presidents herein , My pregnant wit shall shun all future blame , Our pleasure scapes wel , hid with name of kin , And you may clip and kisse , and play with me , A daughters name me thinkes a cloke wil bee . Haue mercy now , I haue my case exprest , Which loue inforst my fearefull hand to write : O grant thy daughter this her first request , That is the occasion of her chiefe delight , This Epitaph deserue thou not ; I haue , The cruel father tooke the life he gaue . And though my lines are blotted euery where , ‘ Twas with my teares that fell ere it was dry , And if my letters scribled do appeare , Whereby you thinke some other wrot to try Your mind : because my curious hand is mist , A fearefull minde , doth bring a shaking fist . And so these scrambled lines I do commend Vnto your loue , be-blurred all with teares , With feruent hope they shall no whit offend , The minde is base , that stil continuall feares . And note you which is the greater blot , To get no childe or kill that you haue got . Thus much this lustfull Lady writ in vaine , And seald it closely with a precious stone , A precious stone clos 'd vp a filthy staine , Her trusty seruant forth she cals anone , And blushing bad him with a merry cheare , He should this letter to her father beare . This scarcely said , old Cynaras did come , And then she cast her letter quite aside . Daughter ( said he ) you see the daily throng Of suters that do seeke thee for their bride : Here be their names my wench , th [= e ] come &amp; show On which of them thou wilt thy selfe bestow . Now for a space she silent did remaine , And onely gazed wishly in his face : She could her teares no longer then restraine , But they ran trickling down her cheeks apace Her father kisses her , and bids her peace , And thought it tender-hearted shamefastnes . He dry 'd her cheekes , and said , my wench be stil , Thy yeares of right , a husband now doth claime Thou shalt not liue a maid by my good will , Nor longer shalt a wanton bed refraine , Then what , or who wilt haue ? come tell me now . At length she did reply ; one like to you . He did allow the choyce , and praisd the same , And kist and clipt her for her louing speech , Not deeming that it tended to their shame , It pleasd her well , &amp; wisht that he would seech A further suit ; and then made this request , Let me live still with you , let wooers rest . Your company I most of all affect , Continue but your loue , it shall suffice , These wrangling husbands why should I respect ? Her father thus againe to her replies , Thy godlinesse ( at which she blushed red ) I like , but thou must tast a Bride-groomes bed . Thou dost not know the pleasure it affords , Nor wanton motions that therein abound . It not consisteth all of pleasant words , More gamesome tricks are there stil to be fo [= u ] d A minde so chaste as thine cannot conceiue What pleasing sports one shall therby receiue . It is no dreame , nor passion of the minde , But a substantiall pleasure there doth dwell , The practike part of dreames therein we finde , Which who so doth omit , leades Apes in hell . Why dost thou blush ? I know your case , belieue , Maids must say nay , yet take when men do giue . And now the sable horses of the night , Haue drawne a mantle ore the siluer sky , And all the stars doe shew their borrowed light , Each breathing thing oprest with sleep doth ly Saue Philomell , that sings of Terreus rape , And Myrha plotting some incestious scape . No rest at all she tooke within her bed , The flames of Cupid burnt so in her brest , And many a fansie comes into her head , Which ouer-much her troubled soule opprest , She doubts , she hopes th [= e ] feare doth make repaire , Sh'l now att [= e ] pt , then shame doth bring despaire . Looke how you see a pleasant field of Corne Moue here &amp; there by gentle-breathing wind , Now vp and downe , as waues in sea are borne : So doubtfull thoughts had motion in her mind : Now shee'l surcease , and now to him repaire Instable , like a feather in the aire . O fye vpon this fowle incestious lust , That very Nature greatly doth abhorre , Some plague will fall vpon all such I trust , If in this world there can be any more . I hope this little world well free-ed is Of Giants , and such monstrous beasts as this . So God preserue it , if it be his will , And let the Gospell euer flourish here , Yet I do feare we haue some yet as ill , The pleasing fooles do with their folly beare : In Paradice I see wee cannot live , But we shall finde some foule seducing Eue . My tongue doth stagger to repeate her name , So foule a blot a Christian cannot brooke , Go seeke a glasse to see this filthy shame , Upon Gods holy Bible daily looke : And there thou maist , as in a mirror see , No Alkeron can yeeld the like to thee . There sucke the Nectar of his Holy Word , And begge thou pardon for thy foule abuse , For euery Sore it can a Salue afford . O Atheist ! learne to make of it good use . Thou Christians blot , to leaue off further talke , Whilst thou hast light , endeuor there to walke . And thou Pænchaia , rich in manys a thing , In Custus , Cynamon and Incense sweete , That out of trees aboundantly doth spring , Of Ammonie , and things for vses meete . Yet whilst thou yeeldest Myrrh , I wey thee not : For thereunto hath Myrha giuen a blot . No measure in her filthy loue she found : No ease , no rest , but death doth like her now . Resolu 'd on this she gets vp from the ground , And mindes to hang her selfe , her loue to shew , And then the noose about her necke she drawes , And said , ô Cynaras ! thou art the onely cause . Farewell therfor , a thousand times farewell , Deere Cynaras thou mightst haue sau 'd my life , And thinke then , this to me alone befell , Because I durst not loue thee as a wife . Farewell againe . Oh welcome gentle death ! And then she went about to stop her breath . A recompence fit for so foule a mind , But yet by chance her aged Nurse did lye Within a chamber that to hers adioyn 'd , Who ouer-hearing this , to her did hye ; And seeing her halfe murdered , so began To shrieke &amp; screeme , &amp; straight vnto her ran . Who first did snatch her girdle from her necke , And powring teares vpon her plentuously , Did hold her in her aged armes , though weake , And kissing her did vrge the reason why She went about away herselfe to make , Or to her shame so base a course to take ? Quoth she , I pray thee tell the cause to me , Behold these empty dugs , and head all gray , These hands that pain haue took in rocking thee Let some , or all these , cause thee to bewray What cruel means haue broght thee in this case . At which the Lady turnd away her face . O be not coy sweet ! hide thou nought from me , I am thy Nurse , she said , and haue good skill In charms , &amp; hearbs , &amp; dreams , that powerful be , Of what thou wantst , Ile helpe thee to thy fill . Art thou in loue , or witcht by any wight ? Il'e finde thee ease , or else will free the quite . I haue bene wanton once as well as you , Now yet by age , am altogether dull , I haue beene loue-sicke , as you may be now , Of toyes and loue-trickes I was wondrous full , How strange so ere thy case do therefore stand , I can and will redresse it out of hand . Thou art in Loue ( my sweet ) I well espy , If so , no lacke shalt finde in me , I sweare , The Lady in her armes sob 'd bitterly , The Nurse replyd , and sayd ; Why do not feare , Thy father shall not know of this at all : At which she starts , and on her bed doth fall . And frantickly she tumbles on her face , And said , get hence ( good Nurse ) I pre'thee go , Constraine me not to shew my wicked case . That case ( quoth she ) I pray thee let me know . Get hence , she answer 'd , or enquire lesse , ‘ Tis wickednesse thou wouldst haue me c [= o ] fesse . ‘ Tis such a thing , that if I want , I die , And being got , is nothing else but shame . The Nurse hereat did sigh most heauily , And on her knees besought to know the same , And holding vp her hands as she did kneele , Said ; Madame , tell the priuie griefe you feele . If you will not discouer this to me I will acquaint your father out of hand , How you had hang 'd your selfe , wer't not for me ; But if you tell , your trusty friend Il'e stand , And let your griefe of any nature be , It shall go hard , but Il'e finde remedy . And if your case be ill , you need not feare The heauie load the wickednesse doth bring , I'le teach thee how most easily to beare , My age hath got experience in each thing . Tell me what ‘ tis that doth so neerely touch , One woman may perswade another much . And now the Lady raisd her heauy head , Hanging vpon her Nurses bosome fast , As she did rise vp from her slothfull bed , Being prodigall , her christall teares to waste , Now she wold speak , &amp; now her speech doth stay Th [= e ] shame doth cause her turne her face away . A franticke fury doth possesse her now , And then she drawes her garment ore her face , And wrings her hands , &amp; to her Nurse doth vow For to acquaint her with her wretched case . And shedding brinish teares into her breast , Thus much her griefe to her at last exprest . Oh happy is my mothers happy state ! That hath a husband Debonaire and faire , Vnhappy am I , most infortunate , At which he stopt , as one falne in dispaire . The Nurse soone found Senecdoche in this , And what the whole meant by a perfect gesse . Her aged bones did shake and tremble fast , Her hoary haire stood staring vp on end , From forth her eyes a heauy looke she cast , And many a sigh her heart distrest did send ; And pausing long , not knowing what to say , At last her tongue her minde did thus bewray . In this I hope , good Lady , you but iest , To try your Nurses now-decaying wit ; So foule a fault is not within your breast , Then tell me true the occasion of this fit . The Lady frown 'd , &amp; stopt her speaking farther , And said get h [= e ] ce , is't shame to loue our father ? I she reply 'd , in such a filthy sort , It is not loue , but lust that you professe , Necessity with true loue cannot sort ; Your loue contaminates , you must confesse . A daughters loue then to your father show , Some loue good things but with bad loue , I know . Or if your wanton flesh you cannot tame , Nor coole the burning of your hot desire , Then take some one that not augmets the shame And set apart to dote vpon your fire . It is most vile to stand in such a need , To make the actor baser then the deed . Besides , his yeares can yeeld no such content , That blithsome wanton dames expect to haue , Herein your bargaine you will soone repent , Wh [= e ] you shal find great want of that you craue : Are you so mad , o will you once beleeue Old men content to frolicke Dames can giue ? Take this example of me , from the Sky , Behold a shooting star from heauen fall Whose glimmering light you scarcely do espye But it is gone as nothing were at all ; And so their sports being scarse begun doth leaue As in the aire concressions we perceiue . Or as the bloomes vpon the Almond-tree , That vanish sooner the the mush-rums done : Or as the flies Hæmere we do see , To leaue their breath their life being scarce begunne , Who thinks that tree whose roots decai 'd by time Can yeeld like fruit to yong ones in their prime . A rotten sticke more fit to burne then vse , I maruell what from age you do expect , Let my experience their defect accuse , And teach thee how thy equals to affect ; When they should toy , iocund &amp; sport with thee , Their gouts , coughs &amp; cramps , wil hindrance be . ‘ Tis nor their fault , but incident to age , Which far more imperfections with it brings , As iealousie , suspicion , fury , rage , Dislike , disdaine , and other such like things , For can the fire , hot in nature , dwell With water cold , but they at length rebell . Euen as in Summer one may aptly note , The fire and water in one cloud contain 'd ; And neither , yet , the mastery hauing got , Being opposits , their furie 's not restrain 'd , But do contend in strife and deadly warre , Til scolding Thunder do pronounce the iarre . Choose from thy woers some peculiar one , Whose loue may fill the measure of thy hopes , And balonize thy wanton sports alone , Whose appetite with thy desire copes , Youth will be frolicke in a Maidens bed , Age is vnapt and heauy as the lead . Youth hath his daliance and his kind embrace , Euen as the Elmes incircled with the Vine ; Age loueth rest and quiet in this case , Saying , Oakes at such like Iuy gripes repine , Yuths pleasing weltun 'd years sweet musick maks When for c [= o ] sort loue strings it strains or slakes . Yet chuse thou one whose tongue 's not set on wheeles Who eats his words before he brings th [= e ] forth That no decorum in his talking feeles , Such are but buzards , blabs of little worth : And for complexion , heerein mee beleeue , The perfect sanguine sweet content doth giue . The Phlegmaticke is like the water cold , The Cholericke wants sap , like fire dry , And Melancholy , as age , is dull and old , But in the Sanguin moist warme iuice doth lie , Whose beauty feeds the eye with sweete delight , The rest do rather feare then please the sight . What pleasure can a sterne grim face affoord , A swarfie colour or rough shagged haire , Or Rauen blacke ? beleeue me at a word , They are too blame that do despise the faire : They please the eye , prouoke dull appetite , Resemble Gods , and do the minde delight . Cease chatting gentle nurse , the Lady said , Or frame thy Tale to sute more with the time , My choice is made , therein I neede no aide Which may be compast by some help of thine , It is too late of abstinence too preach , Wh [= e ] one is drunk , &amp; notes not what you teach . I seeke him not for lust , as you do deeme , For if my mind were onely bent thereto , I could find other men I might esteeme , You know the store of Suters come to woe : But ‘ tis some kind of naturall instinct , Or deuine flame that cannot be extinct . What I do seeke I know is wondrous vile , And haue a will for to withstand the same , Yet can those motions by no meanes exile , So seeketh lust to bring me vnto shame , Be it worse th [= e ] nought to haue it flesh doth striue Helpe Nurse , else long I cannot liue . And wish not to disswade me in this case , Nor giue me counsell to withdraw my minde It likes me well , I weigh not the disgrace , O teach me then to win him to be kind ! Helpe me good Nurse in this my cruell state , All other meanes of comfort comes too late . And since thou needs woldst vnderstand my sham Which I did grieue and blush to ope to thee , And had lear di 'd then told thee of the same , Now be not slacke to lend thy helpe to me , Thou forst me for to open my disgrace , Then lend thy help to salue my wretched case . You do not know good Nurse or haue forgot , What ‘ tis to loue , and cannot it obtaine , Of youths kind daliance age doth take no note , Forgetting it , and thinke all may abstaine : But tis not so , I to those thoughts reply , Then helpe me gentle Nurse , or else I die . Liue still my sweete , quoth she , and do possesse , Yet name of ( father ) shame forc't her conceale And with a staggring speech the word represt , And all her helpe more amply to reueale , She made a vow , whereby herselfe she bound , To do the best that might in her be found . The feasts of gentle Ceres now began , Which yearely they obseru 'd , and held it ill , For thrice three nights to lye with any man , The wiues in white , apparrelled were still , And vnto Ceres , first fruit of the field , ( As garlands made of eares of corne ) did yeeld . The Queen amongst these women did frequent These Rites , and would be absent at that time . The Nurse then to accomplish her intent , And finding Cynaras made blith with wine , The Syren most inchantingly did sing , And thus at last broke silence to the King . Renowned King , but that your constant loue Restraines my tongue &amp; holds my speeches in , A wanton question I would to thee moue ? Speak on , quoth he , good Nurse thy speech begin , With Bacchus feasts do wanton sports agree , I know thou wouldst no ill thing vnto me . Then thus , quoth shee , there is a gallant Maide Of Princely birth and Noble high degree , Who at this time would be right well apaide To kisse thy hand , shee is so in loue with thee , Such diuine beauty in her face doth lurke , That Gods enuy at Nature for the worke . Without offence vnto your Queene and Wife , Vnto this Lady , she is a homely cate , I loue your Queene , and honour her as life , And but admire the others happy state , That 's made so faire that none can like her bee , Your Queene is kind , abuse her not for mee . But if you saw her face , as I haue done , And view 'd the rest of her proportion 'd limbs , You would contemne my Mistres face too soone , Yet loue th [= e ] both : it nought your honor dims , One as your wife , the next for beauties sake , So of them both a beauteous wife but make . The glory of her haire is wonderous bright , Vpon her brows doth ebbe and flow content Her eies in motion do beget delight , Her cheekes a tincture to Aurora lent Her teeths no pearle , her eyes no rubies are , But flesh and bone , more red and white by far . No lisping tongue that fondrels count a grace , But doth to well tun 'd harmony incline , A necke inferior nought vnto the face , And breath most apt for to be prest by thine , Now if the vtter view so glorious proue , Iudge how the hidden parts procure loue . The King who all this while lent listening eare , Being wrapt in admiration of her speech , Now did begin more liuely to appeare And for to know one thing of her did seech , Saying , of what yeeres may this Lady be ? Iust of sweete Myrahs age , replied shee . He said then , bring her to conferre with mee , That I may try if all be true you say . It is most true , as after you shall see , But said the Nurse , you now must let her stay , Perhaps shee'le blush , and be to coy by light , When she will yeeld more kindly in the night . Such pretty Dames will hardly yeeld consent , For in their mouthes they alwaies carry nay , Yet if you giue , to take , they are content , And nere refuse , whatere their tongue doth say : For so they nature simple men abuse , When what they loue they most of all refuse . If I do fable , put me vnto shame , In saying she resembles Myrha much , For ‘ tis so much , as if it were the same ; And when you seeke to gaine the loue of such Let my experience thus much you assure They Fawlcon-like stoop to a ganey lure . And now you may , voide of suspected crime , Dally with her in your lasciuious bed , The sacred Ceres feasts are at this time , And there your Queen is stil : this scarcely sed , Quoth Cyneras , bring her this night to mee , Whereto the Nurse replide , I do agree . With hopefull newes the Nurse return 'd againe , And cheer 'd her chicke , &amp; bad her not be sad , Her wished sute , she certaine should obtaine , The news wherof made Myrha wondrous glad . Yet as she ioy 'd , she was opprest with feare , Such discords of affections in her were . Away slips time and hasteneth on the night , And now the Beare 's seene run about the Pole Conducted forward by Boætes bright , The other stars about the axe-tree role : The Southerne images do shine as gold , Fit monuments for Hunters to behold . At what time Myrha wickedly proceedes And takes in hand to act her base desire , The shamefull lust with cursed hopes she feeds Which quickly sets her heart vpon a fire , And thereupon resolueth on her shame , And not one thought to contradict it came . At which the Sunne his glorious face did hide , Each Planet pulleth in his golden head , The other stars out of the heauens glide And Cynthia from her siluer Palace fled , The night is robbed of her wonted light , Each thing turn 'd dark that formerly was bright . Three times , by stumbling , Myrha was fore-told Of bad successe , if she did not retire ; Three times the Owles like lessons did vnfold , Whose dolefull note do foule mishap require ; Yet she crept on , regarding not the same , The want of light alayed much the shame . The Nurse doth lead her by her owne left hand , The right doth grope the dark and desart way , As silent as the night they now do stand To heare the night-crows scrik , &amp; goblins play The lich-foule beats , and at the window cries , For to come in , to stay the enterprise . O gentle Nurse , said Myrha tell to me , What may these scremes &amp; doleful scriks portend , The nurse reply 'd , my child , no hurt to thee , They are but servants that on night attend , These goblins , lich-fouls , Owls , &amp; night-crows to At murthers raile , with loue haue naught to do . And then the Beldam leads the Lady on Through many roomes &amp; other turning waies As in a laborinth they two had gone ; And as they go , she to the Lady saies ; Now cheere you vp , and get a iocund minde In thinking of the pleasures you shall finde . At last shee brings her to the chamber dore Which softly she did ope , and led her in , The Lady fals to trembling more and more , Her very heart did to relent begin , The neerer to the wickednesse she went , The more to quake and shiuer shee was bent . Looke how you see a blind man on the way Led by another through some desart place , Stagger and grope and at each trifle stay For feare least he should fall : euen in like case , The wretched nurse the fearefull Lady leads , Who shakes and starts at euery step she treads . And now she doth her enterprise repent , And wish she might vnknowne returne againe , Vnto his bed the pawsing Nurse then went ; And cal 'd the King &amp; told him thus much plaine Dread King awake , of pleasures take thy fill , This Ladie 's thine , then vse her as you will . The cursed father then his bowels takes Into his bed , ô filthy blob and staine , His daughter shiuers in his armes , and quakes , This being done , the nurse returnes againe And said , make much of her , to weepe forbeare None wold weepe for that which you now feare . The King then cheeres his daughter , in his arme , Why dost thou weep ? be still my sweete , be stil , Come clip thy loue I meane to do no harme , My Kingly bed with pleasures shall thee fill , And to hide all that idle heads may moue , Hence-forth I call thee daughter and not loue . Come kisse thy father , gentle daughter then , And learne to sport thee in a wanton bed ; Is this the tricks ( she softly said ) of men ? And counterfeiting speech vnknowne , she said , A daughters name , me thinkes , doth not agree , Ist well with your owne child in loue to be ? The King , not deeming who lay by his side , Replies , what hurt deere Lady can it be ? No ill I know by that meanes can betide , The loue more firme thereby we common see : It is not ill though men the same not craue , For we want daughters till a wife we haue . She did reply , and said , why put the case That I were Myrha for as men do say , My countenance resembleth much her face ; Were't not offence , think you , with me to play ? Misdeeming nought , againe , he doth reply ; No more th [= e ] ‘ tis with thee , sweet wench , to lie . O would , quoth Myrha , you could likewise proue Whereby I might but know some reafon why , It were not ill to grant to you my loue , That loue should then alone to you apply ; Were I your daughter I might well consent , Say halfe so much for me I am content . The King replies , my sweete , my will is law , And may command my subiects when I will , Besides all this , you furthermore do know You must obey , I call you daughter still ; Then talke no more , she said , I do agree Thy daughter and thy subiect yeelds to thee . Oh ! now the father his owne child doth take , And of his owne he doth his owne beget , Of his owne loines another child doth make , Repugnant to the Law that nature set ; May ones owne seed to procreation moue ? No sure , unlesse it doth a monster proue . Their musicke is the scriking of the Ow'es , As if the fiends came for to sunder them , The rauing dogs affright them with their howles , As all the fiends came forth to iniure them ; The stars behind the clouds , a great way hence , Like spies lie peeping to disclose the offence . Their bed doth shake and quauer as they lie , As if it groan 'd to beare the weight of sinne , The fatall night-crowes at their windowes flie , And cries out at the shame they do liue in : And that they may perceiue they heauens frown , The Poukes &amp; Goblins pul the couerings down . The pillow that her cursed head doth beare , Which is a castle of accursed ill , The weighty burthen of the same doth feare , And therefore shrinketh inwards from her stil : Whilst both the ends high swelling with disdaine Like angry foe-men raise themselues amaine . The bed , more kind then they religious are , Doth seeke to shroud their foule defiled act , And therefore lets them fall into it farre As in some vale for to conceale the fact : Like bulwarkes rising to defend their names , Or swelling mountains to obscure their shames . O there they lie and glut themselues with sin , A iocund sin that doth the flesh delight , A filthy flesh that can reioyce herein , A silly ioy that gainst the soule doth fight , A fasting sport , a pleasure soone forgot , That bringeth shame with an eternall blot . Thrice happy now , had wicked Myrha bene , If some foule swelling Eban cloud would fall , For her to hide her selfe eternall in , Or had the bed bene burnt with wilde fire all , And thereby moult the heauens golden frame That al things might haue ended with her shame . And now reuenge , a souldier vnto lust , Comes scouring in , as it had bene beguil 'd Accompanied with fame and foule distrust , And with disgrace , blacke luxures basest child , These threaten them and blaze abroad the fact , And like to Trumpets thunder out the act . Not many nights they spending in this sort , But Cyneras at length desir 'd to know Who ‘ twas affoorded him this pleasant sport , And freely did the curtesy bestow : And hauing done this taske vs 'd euery night . Forth he doth steale and goes to seek the light . O hide thee Myrha , ‘ tis not time to sleepe , A thunderbolt is leuel 'd at thy head , Vnlesse thy eies prepare them for to weepe , With fire and sword thou art betrai 'd in bed , Awaken wench , the day of doome bewray , And see the father his owne child betray . And whither steales thou furious Cynaras ? Why seekes a light to open thy owne shame ? Who hop'st to finde in this accursed place ? Make not such hast to spy thy ignoble game , Stay , stay thy feete , thou wilt repent to late , Mischiefe itselfe comes in with speedy gate . What , sleepst thou Myrha ? why th [= e ] sleep thou long Or else awake and welcome in thy woes , Another happy day will neuer come , Pale misery thy pleasure ouer-goes ; Dreame sleeping , thou didst with thy father lie , Or wake , and see him reuenge the villany . Confound thy head , and all thy parts with feare , And thinke the fiends incompasse thee about , Striuing with burning tongs thy flesh to teare , Pulling thy tongue and eies with tortures out ; O thinke with raizors they do flea thy skin , Adding new tortures vnto euery sin . Now comes the father , being fully bent For to disclose his loue with his faire light , Sleepe Myrha , thou hast time for to repent , Arise in care , passe many a weary night ; Looke Cyneras , and spy disgrace too soone , Myrha awake , see what thy lust hath done . Blush lustfull King , and see the end of lust , Behold thy owne dishonour and disgrace , Learne what it is to vse thy wife vniust , And lay a Strumpet in her Princely place , Sham follows th [= e ] reu [= e ] ge hangs o 're their heads That basely do defile their marriage bed . It 's like a tender flower nipt with frost , It euer after hangs his drooping head , And hath her wonted prime of glory lost , Or like the cup that hath his Nectar shed : Cracke you the richest pointed Diamond , And all his prise and glory 's lost and gone . Old Cynaras his daughter knowing well , For very anger could not speake a word , But into most outragious fury fell , And would have kil 'd the Lady with a sword , But nimbly she , by helpe of cloudy night , Conueyes her selfe out of her fathers sight . Most like a Lyon , ranging for a pray , Each corner of the house he madly lookes , No barre , or stop , doth hinder him , or stay , He rifles chambers , beds , and secret nookes . This Lyon seekes for her , the dart did throw , And quietly lets all the other go . By this the Lady 's in the Arabian fields , And fearefully doth range about the same , Which plenteously the bearing Date-tree yeelds , At length she also through Pænchaia came , Her fathers rage being something over-past , At Saba land she doth arriue at last . The King not finding her , begins to fret , And vex himselfe with anguish , care &amp; griefe , He scoulds with fortune , that this trap did set , And chides the Fates for yeelding no reliefe : Small sorrowes grew till they to greater came , Like little sparkes increasing into flame . Euen as a river swelling ore her bounds , By daily falling of small drops of raine , Likewise his care continually abounds , By howerly thinking of his his fault againe , Content were found soone in calamity , The thought thereof raz 'd out of memory . Daughter , quoth he , with eyes full fraught with teares , What hast thou done ? ô foule accursed child ! Why hast deceiu 'd my aged blosom 'd haires ? Why didst thy Princely Father so beguile ? Alasse ! I erre , thou art no childe to me , Nor longer Il'e thy louing father be . Go seeke some hole eternall to lye in , And neuermore behold the heauens light , Thou hast disgraced all thy name and kin , Then hide thee euerlasting from my sight , Thou hast not onely brought vs both to shame , But made thy father actor of the same . How will thy mother thinke her selfe abus 'd , That hast made her a quot-queane shamefully , Of filthy incest I do thee accuse , That Lemmon-like didst with thy father lye , Then hye to hell , haste to the Furies there , When raging parets witnesse gainst thee beare . Oh but the fault thy owne was most of all , Poore Myrha thou didst meane no hurt to me , It wot : thou said'st ( my selfe I witnesse call ) Twas ill with your owne childe in loue to be . And vrg 'd againe , what if she Myrha were , I basely said , there was no fault in her . Then rent thy braines with terror of the deed , Confused thoughts burst thine accursed breast , As if thou did'st on deadly poyson feed , And in Elisium let thy soule nere rest , Rore seas , quake earth , till you deuoure him That hath defil 'd his daughter with foule sin . Yet she did know I was her father deere , What meant she then to seeke me in such sort ? I did not know my daughter to be there , And therefore wished her no kind of hurt . She sin 'd , and knew her father she abused , I sin 'd , uncertaine who it was I vsed . By this the Sunne neere past the Zodiaque ore , And thrice three signes had fully ouer-run , Returning tow'rd the point he was before , Ninty degrees wanting thereto to come , He had the Cliptike and one quadre gone , And in that space the child ripes in the womb . When Myrha weeping much her barne to beare , Tired with wandring in the wood so long , Weary of life beginneth for to feare What shall hereafter on herselfe become . Now she perceiues the folly lust did bring , And may take time of penitence to sing . Things done in haste , haue leasure to repent , A hasty braine is neuer wanting woe , Youth with Decorum seldome is content , Yong yeares and lust associat-like do goe , Youth hath no wit till it be deerely bought , And often times then it is good for nought . Alasse ! quoth Myrha , bursting out with cryes , What shall I do that haue so vilely erred ? Let bellowing grones pierce vp into the skyes , That all the Gods to pitty may be stirred , O let some Trumpets voice from thee be driuen To waken mighty Iupiter in heauen . You gentle Gods , that wonted were to heare The suppliant praiers of distressed soules , Now open wide your gracious listning eare , That I may win some pitty with my houles . O let it stand with your omnipotence , For to remit the sorrowfuls offence . I do confesse my wickednesse is much , And there 's no hope that I should fauour win . Yet your still-pardoning clemency is such , That vndeserued you forgiue our sin , We run in errors every day most ill , Yet you are apt to grant vs pardon still . What haue I gain 'd ? my fathers foule disgrace , My owne dishonor , and my friends disdaine ; What have I won ? an imputation base , My mothers curse , and a perpetuall staine , I seldome see one mischiefe to arise , But it brings others at her heeles likewise . And since my fault into such height is driuen That I deserue not in the earth to rest , Nor haue a place amongst the starres in heauen , You nightly powers grant me this request : That neither with the dead nor liue I do remain , And so no place in earth or heauen gaine . To this her last request the Gods consent , And so the ground her feet did couer ore , Out from her toes the scrawling roots were sent Which by her travell she had bruised sore . These twining roots most plentuously abound , Till they had fixt her body to the ground . Where be the walks that thou wast wont to haue The shady groues paued with Camomile ? The rosie bowers that heate of Sunne did saue , And yeelded to thy sence a pleasant smile ? Where be the pleasant roomes thou solast 's in . Thou art dispoil 'd thereof by thine owne sin . Thou shalt no more within thy Chariot ride , Gazing vpon the people kneeling downe . No more will come to woe thee for a Bride , Lust hath defil 'd the tipe of thy renowne , Those feet of thine , that to offence did lead , Imprisoned are , and not allow 'd to tread . By this the growing tree so far had past , That her faire bones to timber turned were : Her marow did conuert to pyth at last , And all her bloud the name of Sap doth beare , Her armes to bowes , her fingers branches be , Her skin to bark , and so she made a tree . Where is the face that did all faces staine , But shrunke within a hard consolid barke ? No one will sue to kisse it once againe , But must be hid perpetually in darke . That snow-white-neck , that men desir 'd to tuch , Now they refuse to handle it as much . Where are those eyes , those glassy eyes of thine , That lent the glorious Sun his chiefest light ? Where is that Angels voyce , that voyce deuine , Whose wel-tun 'd t [= o ] gue did al the gods delight ? What , are they gone ? doth time thy glory rust ? No , they be spoiled with incestious lust . Farewell thy armes , made kindly to embrace , But now a bough for birds to pearch upon , Farewell thy pretty fingers in like case , The curious Lute ordain 'd to quauer on . Your wonted glory you shall see no more , Your filthy lust hath thrust you out of dore . Now with her shape she lost her sences quite . For that and for her fault she weepeth still ; Which teares are held in honor , price , &amp; might , And daily do out of the tree distill , And from the gummy barke doth issue Myrrh , Which evermore shall beare the name of her . At last the swelling wombe diuides the tree , The infant seeking for some passage out , No Nurse nor Mid-wife could the baby see , The vse of speech his mother is without , And could not therefore begge Lucina 's aid , She might done well could she one prayer said . And therefore sighes and grones most heauily , Bending most humbly to the ground below . Shedding from euery bow teares plenteously . At length the Gods some fauour did bestow . And so Lucina laid her hand thereon , And speaking words , receiu 'd the words anon . The watry Nymphs this pretty child take , And on soft smelling flowers laid him downe , Of which a curious cradle they did make , The hearbs perfumed were for more renowne . The Nymphs this boy affected more and more , And with his mothers teares stil washt him ore. As yeares increase , so beauty doth likewise , And is more faire tomorrow then to day , His beauty more &amp; more continuall doth arise , That enuy did delight , in him bewray , As Venus fell in loue with him at last , Who did reuenge his mothers lusting past .
