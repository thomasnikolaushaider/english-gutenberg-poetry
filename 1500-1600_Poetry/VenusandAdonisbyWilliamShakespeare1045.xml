   <div type="dedication">
    <p>TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE HENRY WRIOTHESLEY , EARL OF SOUHAMPTON , AND BARON OF TICHFIELD . RIGHT HONOURABLE , I know not how I shall offend in dedicating my unpolished lines to your lordship , nor how the world will censure me for choosing so strong a prop to support so weak a burthen : only , if your honour seem but pleased , I account myself highly praised , and vow to take advantage of all idle hours , till I have honoured you with some graver labour . But if the first heir of my invention prove deformed , I shall be sorry it had so noble a godfather , and never after ear so barren a land , for fear it yield me still so bad a harvest . I leave it to your honourable survey , and your honour to your heart 's content ; which I wish may always answer your own wish and the world 's hopeful expectation . Your honour 's in all duty ,</p>

     <l n="44">So soon was she along , as he was down ,</l>

     <l n="53">To fan and blow them dry again she seeks : 52</l>
     <l n="54">He saith she is immodest , blames her miss ;</l>

     <l n="59">Till either gorge be stuff 'd or prey be gone ;</l>

     <l n="70">Pure shame and aw 'd resistance made him fret ,</l>
     <l n="71">Which bred more beauty in his angry eyes :</l>
     <l n="72">Rain added to a river that is rank</l>
