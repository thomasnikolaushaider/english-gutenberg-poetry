   <head>TO THE</head>
   <head>RIGHT-WORSHIPFUL SIR THOMAS WALSINGHAM ,</head>
   <head>KNIGHT .</head>
   <p>Sir , we think not ourselves discharged of the duty we owe to our friend when we have brought the breathless body to the earth ; for albeit the eye there taketh his ever-farewell of that beloved object , yet the impression of the man that hath been dear unto us , living an after-life in our memory , there putteth us in mind of farther obsequies due unto the deceased ; and namely of the performance of whatsoever we may judge shall make to his living credit and to the effecting of his determinations prevented by the stroke of death . By these meditations ( as by an intellectual will ) I suppose myself executor to the unhappily deceased author of this poem ; upon whom knowing that in his lifetime you bestowed many kind favours , entertaining parts of reckoning and worth which you found in him with good countenance and liberal affection , I cannot but see so far into the will of him dead , that whatsoever issue of his brain should chance to come abroad , that the first breath it should take might be the gentle air of your liking ; for , since his self had been accustomed thereunto , it would prove more agreeable and thriving to his right children than any other foster countenance whatsoever . At this time seeing that this unfinished tragedy happens under my hands to be imprinted ; of a double duty , the one to yourself , the other to the deceased , I present the same to your most favourable allowance , offering my utmost self now and ever to be ready at your worship 's disposing :</p>

     <l n="2">Hero 's description and her love 's ;</l>
     <l n="3">The fane of Venus , where he moves</l>
     <l n="4">His worthy love-suit , and attains ;</l>
     <l n="5">Whose bliss the wrath of Fates restrains</l>
     <l n="6">For Cupid 's grace to Mercury :</l>
     <l n="7">Which tale the author doth imply .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="8">On Hellespont , guilty of true love 's blood ,</l>
     <l n="9">In view and opposite two cities stood ,</l>
     <l n="10">Sea-borderers ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>disjoin 'd by Neptune 's might ;</l>
     <l n="11">The one Abydos , the other Sestos hight .</l>
     <l n="12">At Sestos Hero dwelt ; Hero the fair ,</l>
     <l n="13">Whom young Apollo courted for her hair ,</l>
     <l n="14">And offer 'd as a dower his burning throne ,</l>
     <l n="15">Where she should sit , for men to gaze upon .</l>
     <l n="16">The outside of her garments were of lawn ,</l>
     <l n="17">The lining purple silk , with gilt stars drawn ; 10</l>
     <l n="18">Her wide sleeves green , and border 'd with a grove ,</l>
     <l n="19">Where Venus in her naked glory strove</l>
     <l n="20">To please the careless and disdainful eyes</l>
     <l n="21">Of proud Adonis , that before her lies ;</l>
     <l n="22">Her kirtle blue , whereon was many a stain ,</l>
     <l n="23">Made with the blood of wretched lovers slain .</l>
     <l n="24">Upon her head she ware<span type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>a myrtle wreath ,</l>
     <l n="25">From whence her veil reach 'd to the ground beneath :</l>
     <l n="26">Her veil was artificial flowers and leaves ,</l>
     <l n="27">Whose workmanship both man and beast deceives : 20</l>
     <l n="28">Many would praise the sweet smell as she past ,</l>
     <l n="29">When ‘ twas the odour which her breath forth cast ;</l>
     <l n="30">And there for honey bees have sought in vain ,</l>
     <l n="31">And , beat from thence , have lighted there again .</l>
     <l n="32">About her neck hung chains of pebble-stone ,</l>
     <l n="33">Which , lighten 'd by her neck , like diamonds shone .</l>
     <l n="34">She ware no gloves ; for neither sun nor wind</l>
     <l n="35">Would burn or parch her hands , but , to her mind .</l>
     <l n="36">Or warm or cool them , for they took delight</l>
     <l n="37">To play upon those hands , they were so white . 30</l>
     <l n="38">Buskins of shells , all silver 'd , usèd she ,</l>
     <l n="39">And branch 'd with blushing coral to the knee ;</l>
     <l n="40">Where sparrows perch 'd of hollow pearl and gold ,</l>
     <l n="41">Such as the world would wonder to behold :</l>
     <l n="42">Those with sweet water oft her handmaid fills ,</l>
     <l n="43">Which as she went , would cherup through the bills .</l>
     <l n="44">Some say , for her the fairest Cupid pin 'd ,</l>
     <l n="45">And , looking in her face , was strooken blind .</l>
     <l n="46">But this is true ; so like was one the other ,</l>
     <l n="47">As he imagin 'd Hero was his mother ; 40</l>
     <l n="48">And oftentimes into her bosom flew ,</l>
     <l n="49">About her naked neck his bare arms threw ,</l>
     <l n="50">And laid his childish head upon her breast ,</l>
     <l n="51">And , with still panting rock ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 4 ]</span>there took his rest .</l>
     <l n="52">So lovely-fair was Hero , Venus ’ nun ,</l>
     <l n="53">As Nature wept , thinking she was undone ,</l>
     <l n="54">Because she took more from her than she left ,</l>
     <l n="55">And of such wondrous beauty her bereft :</l>
     <l n="56">Therefore , in sign her treasure suffer 'd wrack ,</l>
     <l n="57">Since Hero 's time hath half the world been black . 50</l>
     <l n="58">Amorous Leander , beautiful and young</l>
     <l n="59">( Whose tragedy divine Musæus sung ) ,</l>
     <l n="60">Dwelt at Abydos ; since him dwelt there none</l>
     <l n="61">For whom succeeding times make<span type="note_anchor">[ 5 ]</span>greater moan .</l>
     <l n="62">His dangling tresses , that were never shorn ,</l>
     <l n="63">Had they been cut , and unto Colchos borne ,</l>
     <l n="64">Would have allur 'd the venturous youth of Greece</l>
     <l n="65">To hazard more than for the golden fleece .</l>
     <l n="66">Fair Cynthia wished his arms might be her Sphere ;</l>
     <l n="67">Grief makes her pale , because she moves not there . 60</l>
     <l n="68">His body was as straight as Circe 's wand ;</l>
     <l n="69">Jove might have sipt out nectar from his hand .</l>
     <l n="70">Even as delicious meat is to the tast ,</l>
     <l n="71">So was his neck in touching , and surpast</l>
     <l n="72">The white of Pelops ’ shoulder : I could tell ye ,</l>
     <l n="73">How smooth his breast was , and how white his belly ;</l>
     <l n="74">And whose immortal fingers did imprint</l>
     <l n="75">That heavenly path with many a curious dint</l>
     <l n="76">That runs along his back ; but my rude pen</l>
     <l n="77">Can hardly blazon forth the loves of men , 70</l>
     <l n="78">Much less of powerful gods : let it suffice</l>
     <l n="79">That my slack Muse sings of Leander 's eyes ;</l>
     <l n="80">Those orient cheeks and lips , exceeding his</l>
     <l n="81">That leapt into the water for a kiss</l>
     <l n="82">Of his own shadow , and , despising many ,</l>
     <l n="83">Died ere he could enjoy the love of any .</l>
     <l n="84">Had wild Hippolytus Leander seen ,</l>
     <l n="85">Enamour 'd of his beauty had he been :</l>
     <l n="86">His presence made the rudest peasant melt ,</l>
     <l n="87">That in the vast uplandish country dwelt ; 80</l>
     <l n="88">The barbarous Thracian soldier , mov 'd with nought ,</l>
     <l n="89">Was mov 'd with him , and for his favour sought .</l>
     <l n="90">Some swore he was a maid in man 's attire ,</l>
     <l n="91">For in his looks were all that men desire ,—</l>
     <l n="92">A pleasant-smiling cheek , a speaking eye ,</l>
     <l n="93">A brow for love to banquet royally ;</l>
     <l n="94">And such as knew he was a man , would say ,</l>
     <l n="95">“ Leander , thou art made for amorous play :</l>
     <l n="96">Why art thou not in love , and loved of all ?</l>
     <l n="97">Though thou be fair , yet be not thine own thrall . ” 90</l>
     <l n="98">The men of wealthy Sestos every year ,</l>
     <l n="99">For his sake whom their goddess held so dear ,</l>
     <l n="100">Rose-cheek 'd<span type="note_anchor">[ 6 ]</span>Adonis , kept a solemn feast :</l>
     <l n="101">Thither resorted many a wandering guest</l>
     <l n="102">To meet their loves : such as had none at all</l>
     <l n="103">Came lovers home from this great festival ;</l>
     <l n="104">For every street , like to a firmament ,</l>
     <l n="105">Glister 'd with breathing stars , who , where they went ,</l>
     <l n="106">Frighted the melancholy earth , which deem 'd</l>
     <l n="107">Eternal heaven to burn , for so it seem 'd , 100</l>
     <l n="108">As if another Phaëton had got</l>
     <l n="109">The guidance of the sun 's rich chariot .</l>
     <l n="110">But , far above the loveliest , Hero shin 'd ,</l>
     <l n="111">And stole away th ’ enchanted gazer 's mind ;</l>
     <l n="112">For like sea-nymphs ’ inveigling harmony ,</l>
     <l n="113">So was her beauty to the standers by ;</l>
     <l n="114">Nor that night-wandering , pale , and watery<span type="note_anchor">[ 7 ]</span>star</l>
     <l n="115">( When yawning dragons draw her thirling<span type="note_anchor">[ 8 ]</span>car</l>
     <l n="116">From Latmus ’ mount up to the gloomy sky ,</l>
     <l n="117">Where , crown 'd with blazing light and majesty , 110</l>
     <l n="118">She proudly sits ) more over-rules the flood</l>
     <l n="119">Than she the hearts of those that near her stood .</l>
     <l n="120">Even as when gaudy nymphs pursue the chase ,</l>
     <l n="121">Wretched Ixion 's shaggy-footed race ,</l>
     <l n="122">Incens 'd with savage heat , gallop amain</l>
     <l n="123">From steep pine-bearing mountains to the plain ,</l>
     <l n="124">So ran the people forth to gaze upon her ,</l>
     <l n="125">And all that view 'd her were enamour 'd on her :</l>
     <l n="126">And as in fury of a dreadful fight ,</l>
     <l n="127">Their fellows being slain or put to flight , 120</l>
     <l n="128">Poor soldiers stand with fear of death dead-strooken ,</l>
     <l n="129">So at her presence all surpris 'd and tooken ,</l>
     <l n="130">Await the sentence of her scornful eyes ;</l>
     <l n="131">He whom she favours lives ; the other dies :</l>
     <l n="132">There might you see one sigh ; another rage ;</l>
     <l n="133">And some , their violent passions to assuage ,</l>
     <l n="134">Compile sharp satires ; but , alas , too late !</l>
     <l n="135">For faithful love will never turn to hate ;</l>
     <l n="136">And many , seeing great princes were denied ,</l>
     <l n="137">Pin 'd as they went , and thinking on her died . 130</l>
     <l n="138">On this feast-day — O cursèd day and hour !—</l>
     <l n="139">Went Hero thorough Sestos , from her tower</l>
     <l n="140">To Venus ’ temple , where unhappily ,</l>
     <l n="141">As after chanc 'd , they did each other spy .</l>
     <l n="142">So fair a church as this had Venus none :</l>
     <l n="143">The walls were of discolour 'd<span type="note_anchor">[ 9 ]</span>jasper-stone ,</l>
     <l n="144">Wherein was Proteus carved ; and over-head</l>
     <l n="145">A lively vine of green sea-agate spread ,</l>
     <l n="146">Where by one hand light-headed Bacchus hung ,</l>
     <l n="147">And with the other wine from grapes out-wrung . 140</l>
     <l n="148">Of crystal shining fair the pavement was ;</l>
     <l n="149">The town of Sestos call 'd it Venus ’ glass :</l>
     <l n="150">There might you see the gods , in sundry shapes ,</l>
     <l n="151">Committing heady riots , incests , rapes ;</l>
     <l n="152">For know , that underneath this radiant flour<span type="note_anchor">[ 10 ]</span></l>
     <l n="153">Was Danäe 's statue in a brazen tower :</l>
     <l n="154">Jove slily stealing from his sister 's bed ,</l>
     <l n="155">To dally with Idalian Ganymed ,</l>
     <l n="156">And for his love Europa bellowing loud ,</l>
     <l n="157">And tumbling with the Rainbow in a cloud ; 150</l>
     <l n="158">Blood-quaffing Mars heaving the iron net</l>
     <l n="159">Which limping Vulcan and his Cyclops set ;</l>
     <l n="160">Love kindling fire , to burn such towns as Troy ;</l>
     <l n="161">Silvanus weeping for the lovely boy</l>
     <l n="162">That now is turned into a cypress-tree ,</l>
     <l n="163">Under whose shade the wood-gods love to be .</l>
     <l n="164">And in the midst a silver altar stood :</l>
     <l n="165">There Hero , sacrificing turtles ’ blood ,</l>
     <l n="166">Vailed<span type="note_anchor">[ 11 ]</span>to the ground , veiling her eyelids close ;</l>
     <l n="167">And modestly they opened as she rose : 160</l>
     <l n="168">Thence flew Love 's arrow with the golden head ;</l>
     <l n="169">And thus Leander was enamourèd .</l>
     <l n="170">Stone-still he stood , and evermore he gaz 'd ,</l>
     <l n="171">Till with the fire , that from his countenance blaz 'd ,</l>
     <l n="172">Relenting Hero 's gentle heart was strook :</l>
     <l n="173">Such force and virtue hath an amorous look .</l>
     <l n="174">It lies not in our power to love or hate ,</l>
     <l n="175">For will in us is over-rul 'd by fate .</l>
     <l n="176">When two are stript long ere the course begin ,</l>
     <l n="177">We wish that one should lose , the other win ; 170</l>
     <l n="178">And one especially do we affect</l>
     <l n="179">Of two gold ingots , like in each respect :</l>
     <l n="180">The reason no man knows , let it suffice ,</l>
     <l n="181">What we behold is censur 'd by our eyes .</l>

     <l n="183">Who ever lov 'd , that lov 'd not at first sight ?<span type="note_anchor">[ 12 ]</span></l>
     <l n="184">He kneel 'd ; but unto her devoutly prayed :</l>
     <l n="185">Chaste Hero to herself thus softly said ,</l>
     <l n="186">“ Were I the saint he worships , I would hear him ; ”</l>
     <l n="187">And , as she spake those words , came somewhat near him . 180</l>
     <l n="188">He started up ; she blushed as one asham 'd ;</l>
     <l n="189">Wherewith Leander much more was inflam 'd .</l>
     <l n="190">He touch 'd her hand ; in touching it she trembled :</l>
     <l n="191">Love deeply grounded hardly is dissembled .</l>
     <l n="192">These lovers parled by the touch of hands :</l>
     <l n="193">True love is mute , and oft amazèd stands .</l>
     <l n="194">Thus while dumb signs their yielding hearts entangled ,</l>
     <l n="195">The air with sparks of living fire was spangled ;</l>
     <l n="196">And night ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 13 ]</span>deep-drenched in misty Acheron ,</l>
     <l n="197">Heav 'd up her head , and half the world upon 190</l>
     <l n="198">Breath 'd darkness forth ( dark night is Cupid 's day ):</l>
     <l n="199">And now begins Leander to display</l>
     <l n="200">Love 's holy fire , with words , with sighs , and tears ;</l>
     <l n="201">Which , like sweet music , enter 'd Hero 's ears ;</l>
     <l n="202">And yet at every word she turn 'd aside</l>
     <l n="203">And always cut him off , as he replied .</l>
     <l n="204">At last , like to a bold sharp sophister ,</l>
     <l n="205">With cheerful hope thus he accosted her .</l>

     <l n="318">Thereat she smil 'd , and did deny him so ,</l>

     <l n="338">Hero 's looks yielded , but her words made war :</l>
     <l n="339">Women are won when they begin to jar .</l>
     <l n="340">Thus , having swallow 'd Cupid 's golden hook ,</l>
     <l n="341">The more she striv 'd , the deeper was she strook :</l>
     <l n="342">Yet , evilly feigning anger , strove she still ,</l>
     <l n="343">And would be thought to grant against her will .</l>
     <l n="344">So having paus 'd a while , at last she said ,</l>

     <l n="348">With that , Leander stooped to have embrac 'd her ,</l>
     <l n="349">But from his spreading arms away she cast her ,</l>
     <l n="350">And thus bespake him : “ Gentle youth , forbear</l>

     <l n="358">My turret stands ; and there , God knows , I play</l>
     <l n="359">With Venus ’ swans and sparrows all the day .</l>
     <l n="360">A<span type="note_anchor">[ 21 ]</span>dwarfish beldam bears me company ,</l>
     <l n="361">That hops about the chamber where I lie ,</l>

     <l n="363">In vain discourse and apish merriment :—</l>
     <l n="364">Come thither . ” As she spake this , her tongue tripp 'd ,</l>
     <l n="365">For unawares “ Come thither ” from her slipp 'd ;</l>
     <l n="366">And suddenly her former colour chang 'd ,</l>
     <l n="367">And here and there her eyes through anger rang 'd ; 360</l>
     <l n="368">And , like a planet moving several ways</l>
     <l n="369">At one self instant , she , poor soul , assays ,</l>
     <l n="370">Loving , not to love at all , and every part</l>
     <l n="371">Strove to resist the motions of her heart :</l>
     <l n="372">And hands so pure , so innocent , nay , such</l>
     <l n="373">As might have made Heaven stoop to have a touch ,</l>
     <l n="374">Did she uphold to Venus , and again</l>
     <l n="375">Vow 'd spotless chastity ; but all in vain ;</l>
     <l n="376">Cupid beats down her prayers with his wings ;</l>
     <l n="377">Her vows above<span type="note_anchor">[ 22 ]</span>the empty air he flings : 370</l>
     <l n="378">All deep enrag 'd , his sinewy bow he bent ,</l>
     <l n="379">And shot a shaft that burning from him went ;</l>
     <l n="380">Wherewith she strooken , look 'd so dolefully ,</l>
     <l n="381">As made Love sigh to see his tyranny ;</l>
     <l n="382">And , as she wept , her tears to pearl he turn 'd ,</l>
     <l n="383">And wound them on his arm , and for her mourn 'd .</l>
     <l n="384">Then towards the palace of the Destinies ,</l>
     <l n="385">Laden with languishment and grief , he flies ,</l>
     <l n="386">And to those stern nymphs humbly made request ,</l>
     <l n="387">Both might enjoy each other , and be blest . 380</l>
     <l n="388">But with a ghastly dreadful countenance ,</l>
     <l n="389">Threatening a thousand deaths at every glance ,</l>
     <l n="390">They answer 'd Love , nor would vouchsafe so much</l>
     <l n="391">As one poor word , their hate to him was such :</l>

     <l n="393">Heaven 's wingèd herald , Jove-born Mercury ,</l>
     <l n="394">The self-same day that he asleep had laid</l>
     <l n="395">Enchanted Argus , spied a country maid ,</l>
     <l n="396">Whose careless hair , instead of pearl t'adorn it ,</l>
     <l n="397">Glister 'd with dew , as one that seemed to scorn it ; 390</l>
     <l n="398">Her breath as fragrant as the morning rose ;</l>
     <l n="399">Her mind pure , and her tongue untaught to glose :</l>
     <l n="400">Yet proud she was ( for lofty Pride that dwells</l>

     <l n="402">And too-too well the fair vermillion knew</l>
     <l n="403">And silver tincture of her cheeks that drew</l>
     <l n="404">The love of every swain . On her this god</l>
     <l n="405">Enamour 'd was , and with his snaky rod</l>
     <l n="406">Did charm her nimble feet , and made her stay ,</l>
     <l n="407">The while upon a hillock down he lay , 400</l>
     <l n="408">And sweetly on his pipe began to play ,</l>
     <l n="409">And with smooth speech her fancy to assay ,</l>
     <l n="410">Till in his twining arms he lock 'd her fast ,</l>
     <l n="411">And then he woo 'd with kisses ; and at last ,</l>
     <l n="412">As shepherds do , her on the ground he laid ,</l>
     <l n="413">And , tumbling in the grass , he often stray 'd</l>
     <l n="414">Beyond the bounds of shame , in being bold</l>
     <l n="415">To eye those parts which no eye should behold ;</l>
     <l n="416">And , like an insolent commanding lover ,</l>
     <l n="417">Boasting his parentage , would needs discover 410</l>

     <l n="420">Having striven in vain , was now about to cry ,</l>
     <l n="421">And crave the help of shepherds that were nigh .</l>
     <l n="422">Herewith he stay 'd his fury , and began</l>

     <l n="431">And neither would deny nor grant his suit .</l>
     <l n="432">Still vow 'd he love : she , wanting no excuse</l>
     <l n="433">To feed him with delays , as women use ,</l>
     <l n="434">Or thirsting after immortality ,</l>
     <l n="435">( All women are ambitious naturally ) ,</l>
     <l n="436">Impos 'd upon her lover such a task ,</l>
     <l n="437">As he ought not perform , nor yet she ask ; 430</l>
     <l n="438">A draught of flowing nectar she requested ,</l>
     <l n="439">Wherewith the king of gods and men is feasted .</l>
     <l n="440">He , ready to accomplish what she will 'd ,</l>
     <l n="441">Stole some from Hebe ( Hebe Jove 's cup fill 'd ) ,</l>

     <l n="468">He , reckless of his promise , did despise</l>
     <l n="469">The love of th ’ everlasting Destinies .</l>
     <l n="470">They , seeing it , both Love and him abhorr 'd ,</l>
     <l n="471">And Jupiter unto his place restor 'd :</l>

     <l n="474">And to the seat of Jove itself advance ,</l>
     <l n="475">Hermes had slept in hell with Ignorance .</l>
     <l n="476">Yet , as a punishment , they added this ,</l>
     <l n="477">That he and Poverty should always kiss ; 470</l>
     <l n="478">And to this day is every scholar poor :</l>
     <l n="479">Gross gold from them runs headlong to the boor .</l>
     <l n="480">Likewise the angry Sisters , thus deluded ,</l>

     <l n="484">And fruitful wits , that inaspiring<span type="note_anchor">[ 25 ]</span>are ,</l>
     <l n="485">Shall , discontent , run into regions far ;</l>
     <l n="486">And few great lords in virtuous deeds shall joy</l>
     <l n="487">But be surpris 'd with every garish toy , 480</l>
     <l n="488">And still enrich the lofty servile clown ,</l>
     <l n="489">Who with encroaching guile keeps learning down .</l>

     <l n="2">Hero of love takes deeper sense ,</l>
     <l n="3">And doth her love more recompense :</l>
     <l n="4">Their first night 's meeting , where sweet kisses</l>
     <l n="5">Are th ’ only crowns of both their blisses</l>
     <l n="6">He swims t ’ Abydos , and returns :</l>
     <l n="7">Cold Neptune with his beauty burns ;</l>
     <l n="8">Whose suit he shuns , and doth aspire</l>
     <l n="9">Hero 's fair tower and his desire .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="10">By this , sad Hero , with love unacquainted ,</l>
     <l n="11">Viewing Leander 's face , fell down and fainted .</l>
     <l n="12">He kiss 'd her , and breath 'd life<span type="note_anchor">[ 26 ]</span>into her lips ;</l>
     <l n="13">Wherewith , as one displeas 'd , away she trips ;</l>
     <l n="14">Yet , as she went , full often look 'd behind ,</l>
     <l n="15">And many poor excuses did she find</l>
     <l n="16">To linger by the way , and once she stay 'd ,</l>
     <l n="17">And would have turn 'd again , but was afraid ,</l>
     <l n="18">In offering parley , to be counted light :</l>
     <l n="19">So on she goes , and , in her idle flight , 10</l>
     <l n="20">Her painted fan of curled plumes let fall ,</l>
     <l n="21">Thinking to train Leander therewithal .</l>
     <l n="22">He , being a novice , knew not what she meant ,</l>
     <l n="23">But stay 'd , and after her a letter sent ;</l>
     <l n="24">Which joyful Hero answer 'd in such sort ,</l>
     <l n="25">As he had hope to scale the beauteous fort</l>
     <l n="26">Wherein the liberal Graces locked their wealth ;</l>
     <l n="27">And therefore to her tower he got by stealth .</l>
     <l n="28">Wide open stood the door ; he need not climb ;</l>
     <l n="29">And she herself , before the pointed time , 20</l>
     <l n="30">Had spread the board , with roses strew 'd the room ,</l>
     <l n="31">And oft looked out , and mused he did not come .</l>
     <l n="32">At last he came : O , who can tell the greeting</l>
     <l n="33">These greedy lovers had at their first meeting ?</l>
     <l n="34">He asked ; she gave ; and nothing was denied ;</l>
     <l n="35">Both to each other quickly were affied :</l>
     <l n="36">Look how their hands , so were their hearts united ,</l>
     <l n="37">And what he did , she willingly requited .</l>
     <l n="38">( Sweet are the kisses , the embracements sweet ,</l>
     <l n="39">When like desires and like<span type="note_anchor">[ 27 ]</span>affections meet ; 30</l>
     <l n="40">For from the earth to heaven is Cupid raised ,</l>
     <l n="41">Where fancy is in equal balance paised . [ 28 ])</l>
     <l n="42">Yet she this rashness suddenly repented ,</l>
     <l n="43">And turn 'd aside , and to herself lamented ,</l>
     <l n="44">As if her name and honour had been wronged</l>
     <l n="45">By being possessed of him for whom she longed ;</l>
     <l n="46">I , and she wished , albeit not from her heart ,</l>
     <l n="47">That he would leave her turret and depart .</l>
     <l n="48">The mirthful god of amorous pleasure smiled</l>
     <l n="49">To see how he this captive nymph beguiled ; 40</l>
     <l n="50">For hitherto he did but fan the fire ,</l>
     <l n="51">And kept it down , that it might mount the higher .</l>
     <l n="52">Now wax 'd she jealous lest his love abated ,</l>
     <l n="53">Fearing her own thoughts made her to be hated .</l>
     <l n="54">Therefore unto him hastily she goes ,</l>
     <l n="55">And , like light Salmacis , her body throws</l>
     <l n="56">Upon his bosom , where with yielding eyes</l>
     <l n="57">She offers up herself a sacrifice</l>
     <l n="58">To slake her anger , if he were displeased :</l>
     <l n="59">O , what god would not therewith be appeased ? 50</l>
     <l n="60">Like Æsop 's cock , this jewel he enjoyed ,</l>
     <l n="61">And as a brother with his sister toyed ,</l>
     <l n="62">Supposing nothing else was to be done ,</l>
     <l n="63">Now he her favour and goodwill had won .</l>
     <l n="64">But know you not that creatures wanting sense ,</l>
     <l n="65">By nature have a mutual appetence ,</l>
     <l n="66">And , wanting organs to advance a step ,</l>
     <l n="67">Mov 'd by love 's force , unto each other lep ?</l>
     <l n="68">Much more in subjects having intellect</l>
     <l n="69">Some hidden influence breeds like effect . 60</l>
     <l n="70">Albeit Leander , rude in love and raw ,</l>
     <l n="71">Long dallying with Hero , nothing saw</l>
     <l n="72">That might delight him more , yet he suspected</l>
     <l n="73">Some amorous rites or other were neglected .</l>
     <l n="74">Therefore unto his body hers he clung :</l>
     <l n="75">She , fearing on the rushes<span type="note_anchor">[ 29 ]</span>to be flung ,</l>
     <l n="76">Strived with redoubled strength ; the more she strived ,</l>
     <l n="77">The more a gentle pleasing heat revived ,</l>
     <l n="78">Which taught him all that elder lovers know ;</l>
     <l n="79">And now the same gan so to scorch and glow , 70</l>
     <l n="80">As in plain terms , yet cunningly , he 'd crave<span type="note_anchor">[ 30 ]</span>it :</l>
     <l n="81">Love always makes those eloquent that have it .</l>
     <l n="82">She , with a kind of granting , put him by it ,</l>
     <l n="83">And ever , as he thought himself most nigh it ,</l>
     <l n="84">Like to the tree of Tantalus , she fled ,</l>
     <l n="85">And , seeming lavish , saved her maidenhead .</l>
     <l n="86">Ne'er king more sought to keep his diadem ,</l>
     <l n="87">Than Hero this inestimable gem :</l>
     <l n="88">Above our life we love a steadfast friend ;</l>
     <l n="89">Yet when a token of great worth we send , 80</l>
     <l n="90">We often kiss it , often look thereon ,</l>
     <l n="91">And stay the messenger that would be gone ;</l>
     <l n="92">No marvel , then , though Hero would not yield</l>
     <l n="93">So soon to part from that she dearly held :</l>
     <l n="94">Jewels being lost are found again ; this never ;</l>
     <l n="95">‘ Tis lost but once , and once lost , lost for ever .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="96">Now had the Morn espied her lover 's steeds ;</l>
     <l n="97">Whereat she starts , puts on her purple weeds ,</l>
     <l n="98">And , red for anger that he stayed so long ,</l>
     <l n="99">All headlong throws herself the clouds among . 90</l>
     <l n="100">And now Leander , fearing to be missed ,</l>
     <l n="101">Embraced her suddenly , took leave , and kissed :</l>
     <l n="102">Long was he taking leave , and loath to go ,</l>
     <l n="103">And kissed again , as lovers use to do .</l>
     <l n="104">Sad Hero wrung him by the hand , and wept ,</l>
     <l n="105">Saying , “ Let your vows and promises be kept : ”</l>
     <l n="106">Then standing at the door , she turned about ,</l>
     <l n="107">As loath to see Leander going out .</l>
     <l n="108">And now the sun , that through th ’ horizon peeps ,</l>
     <l n="109">As pitying these lovers , downward creeps ; 100</l>
     <l n="110">So that in silence of the cloudy night ,</l>
     <l n="111">Though it was morning , did he take his flight .</l>
     <l n="112">But what the secret trusty night concealed ,</l>
     <l n="113">Leander 's amorous habit soon revealed :</l>
     <l n="114">With Cupid 's myrtle was his bonnet crowned ,</l>
     <l n="115">About his arms the purple riband wound ,</l>
     <l n="116">Wherewith she wreath 'd her largely-spreading hair ;</l>
     <l n="117">Nor could the youth abstain , but he must wear</l>
     <l n="118">The sacred ring wherewith she was endowed ,</l>
     <l n="119">When first religious chastity she vowed ; 110</l>
     <l n="120">Which made his love through Sestos to be known ,</l>
     <l n="121">And thence unto Abydos sooner blown</l>
     <l n="122">Than he could sail ; for incorporeal Fame ,</l>
     <l n="123">Whose weight consists in nothing but her name ,</l>
     <l n="124">Is swifter than the wind , whose tardy plumes</l>
     <l n="125">Are reeking water and dull earthly fumes .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="126">Home when he came , he seemed not to be there ,</l>
     <l n="127">But , like exilèd air thrust from his sphere ,</l>
     <l n="128">Set in a foreign place ; and straight from thence ,</l>
     <l n="129">Alcides-like , by mighty violence , 120</l>
     <l n="130">He would have chas 'd away the swelling main ,</l>
     <l n="131">That him from her unjustly did detain .</l>
     <l n="132">Like as the sun in a diameter</l>
     <l n="133">Fires and inflames objects removèd far ,</l>
     <l n="134">And heateth kindly , shining laterally ;</l>
     <l n="135">So beauty sweetly quickens when ‘ tis nigh ,</l>
     <l n="136">But being separated and removed ,</l>
     <l n="137">Burns where it cherished , murders where it loved .</l>
     <l n="138">Therefore even as an index to a book ,</l>
     <l n="139">So to his mind was young Leander 's look . 130</l>
     <l n="140">O , none but gods have power<span type="note_anchor">[ 31 ]</span>their love to hide !</l>
     <l n="141">Affection by the countenance is descried ;</l>
     <l n="142">The light of hidden fire itself discovers ,</l>
     <l n="143">And love that is concealed betrays poor lovers .</l>
     <l n="144">His secret flame apparently was seen :</l>
     <l n="145">Leander 's father knew where he had been ,</l>
     <l n="146">And for the same mildly rebuk 'd his son ,</l>
     <l n="147">Thinking to quench the sparkles new-begun .</l>
     <l n="148">But love , resisted once , grows passionate ,</l>
     <l n="149">And nothing more than counsel lovers hate ; 140</l>
     <l n="150">For as a hot proud horse highly disdains</l>
     <l n="151">To have his head controlled , but breaks the reins ,</l>
     <l n="152">Spits forth the ringled<span type="note_anchor">[ 32 ]</span>bit , and with his hoves</l>
     <l n="153">Checks the submissive ground ; so he that loves ,</l>
     <l n="154">The more he is restrain 'd , the worse he fares :</l>
     <l n="155">What is it now but mad Leander dares ?</l>
     <l n="156">“ O Hero , Hero ! ” thus he cried full oft ;</l>
     <l n="157">And then he got him to a rock aloft ,</l>
     <l n="158">Where having spied her tower , long star 'd he o n't ,</l>
     <l n="159">And pray 'd the narrow toiling Hellespont 150</l>
     <l n="160">To part in twain , that he might come and go ;</l>
     <l n="161">But still the rising billows answer 'd , “ No . ”</l>
     <l n="162">With that , he stripp 'd him to the ivory skin ,</l>
     <l n="163">And , crying , “ Love , I come , ” leap 'd lively in :</l>
     <l n="164">Whereat the sapphire-visaged god grew proud ,</l>
     <l n="165">And made his capering Triton sound aloud ,</l>
     <l n="166">Imagining that Ganymede , displeas 'd ,</l>
     <l n="167">Had left the heavens ; therefore on him he seiz 'd .</l>
     <l n="168">Leander strived ; the waves about him wound ,</l>
     <l n="169">And pull 'd him to the bottom , where the ground 160</l>
     <l n="170">Was strewed with pearl , and in low coral groves</l>
     <l n="171">Sweet-singing mermaids sported with their loves</l>
     <l n="172">On heaps of heavy gold , and took great pleasure</l>
     <l n="173">To spurn in careless sort the shipwreck treasure ;</l>
     <l n="174">For here the stately azure palace stood ,</l>
     <l n="175">Where kingly Neptune and his train abode .</l>
     <l n="176">The lusty god embrac 'd him , called him “ Love , ”</l>
     <l n="177">And swore he never should return to Jove :</l>
     <l n="178">But when he knew it was not Ganymed ,</l>
     <l n="179">For under water he was almost dead , 170</l>
     <l n="180">He heav 'd him up , and , looking on his face ,</l>
     <l n="181">Beat down the bold waves with his triple mace ,</l>
     <l n="182">Which mounted up , intending to have kiss 'd him ,</l>
     <l n="183">And fell in drops like tears because they miss 'd him .</l>
     <l n="184">Leander , being up , began to swim ,</l>
     <l n="185">And , looking back , saw Neptune follow him :</l>
     <l n="186">Whereat aghast , the poor soul gan to cry ,</l>
     <l n="187">“ O , let me visit Hero ere I die ! ”</l>
     <l n="188">The god put Helle 's bracelet on his arm ,</l>
     <l n="189">And swore the sea should never do him harm . 180</l>
     <l n="190">He clapped his plump cheeks , with his tresses played ,</l>
     <l n="191">And , smiling wantonly , his love bewrayed ;</l>
     <l n="192">He watched his arms , and , as they open 'd wide</l>
     <l n="193">At every stroke , betwixt them would he slide ,</l>
     <l n="194">And steal a kiss , and then run out and dance ,</l>
     <l n="195">And , as he turn 'd , cast many a lustful glance ,</l>
     <l n="196">And throw him gaudy toys to please his eye ,</l>
     <l n="197">And dive into the water , and there pry</l>
     <l n="198">Upon his breast , his thighs , and every limb ,</l>
     <l n="199">And up again , and close beside him swim , 190</l>
     <l n="200">And talk of love . Leander made reply ,</l>
     <l n="201">“ You are deceiv 'd ; I am no woman , I . ”</l>
     <l n="202">Thereat smil 'd Neptune , and then told a tale ,</l>
     <l n="203">How that a shepherd , sitting in a vale ,</l>
     <l n="204">Play 'd with a boy so lovely-fair<span type="note_anchor">[ 33 ]</span>and kind ,</l>
     <l n="205">As for his love both earth and heaven pin 'd ;</l>
     <l n="206">That of the cooling river durst not drink ,</l>
     <l n="207">Lest water-nymphs should pull him from the brink ;</l>
     <l n="208">And when he sported in the fragrant lawns ,</l>
     <l n="209">Goat-footed Satyrs and up-staring<span type="note_anchor">[ 34 ]</span>Fauns 200</l>
     <l n="210">Would steal him thence . Ere half this tale was done ,</l>
     <l n="211">“ Ay me , ” Leander cried , “ th ’ enamoured sun ,</l>
     <l n="212">That now should shine on Thetis ’ glassy bower ,</l>
     <l n="213">Descends upon my radiant Hero 's tower :</l>
     <l n="214">O , that these tardy arms of mine were wings ! ”</l>
     <l n="215">And , as he spake , upon the waves he springs .</l>
     <l n="216">Neptune was angry that he gave no ear ,</l>
     <l n="217">And in his heart revenging malice bare :</l>
     <l n="218">He flung at him his mace ; but , as it went ,</l>
     <l n="219">He call 'd it in , for love made him repent : 210</l>
     <l n="220">The mace , returning back , his own hand hit ,</l>
     <l n="221">As meaning to be venged for darting it .</l>
     <l n="222">When this fresh-bleeding wound Leander viewed ,</l>
     <l n="223">His colour went and came , as if he rued</l>
     <l n="224">The grief which Neptune felt : in gentle breasts</l>
     <l n="225">Relenting thoughts , remorse , and pity rests ;</l>
     <l n="226">And who have hard hearts and obdurate minds ,</l>
     <l n="227">But vicious , hare-brained , and illiterate hinds ?</l>
     <l n="228">The god , seeing him with pity to be moved ,</l>
     <l n="229">Thereon concluded that he was beloved . 220</l>
     <l n="230">( Love is too full of faith , too credulous ,</l>
     <l n="231">With folly and false hope deluding us ) ;</l>
     <l n="232">Wherefore , Leander 's fancy to surprise ,</l>
     <l n="233">To the rich ocean for gifts he flies :</l>
     <l n="234">Tis wisdom to give much ; a gift prevails</l>
     <l n="235">When deep persuading oratory fails ,</l>
     <l n="236">By this , Leander , being near the land ,</l>
     <l n="237">Cast down his weary feet , and felt the sand .</l>
     <l n="238">Breathless albeit he were , he rested not</l>
     <l n="239">Till to the solitary tower he got ; 230</l>
     <l n="240">And knocked and called : at which celestial noise</l>
     <l n="241">The longing heart of Hero much more joys ,</l>
     <l n="242">Than nymphs and shepherds when the timbrel rings ,</l>
     <l n="243">Or crookèd dolphin when the sailor sings .</l>
     <l n="244">She stayed not for her robes , but straight arose ,</l>
     <l n="245">And , drunk with gladness , to the door she goes ;</l>
     <l n="246">Where seeing a naked man , she screeched for fear</l>
     <l n="247">( Such sights as this to tender maids are rare ) ,</l>
     <l n="248">And ran into the dark herself to hide</l>
     <l n="249">( Rich jewels in the dark are soonest spied ) . 240</l>
     <l n="250">Unto her was he led , or rather drawn ,</l>
     <l n="251">By those white limbs which sparkled through the lawn .</l>
     <l n="252">The nearer that he came , the more she fled ,</l>
     <l n="253">And , seeking refuge , slipt into her bed ;</l>
     <l n="254">Whereon Leander sitting , thus began ,</l>
     <l n="255">Through numbing cold , all feeble , faint , and wan .</l>
     <l n="256">“ If not for love , yet , love , for pity-sake ,</l>
     <l n="257">Me in thy bed and maiden bosom take ;</l>
     <l n="258">At least vouchsafe these arms some little room ,</l>
     <l n="259">Who , hoping to embrace thee , cheerly swoom : 250</l>
     <l n="260">This head was beat with many a churlish billow ,</l>
     <l n="261">And therefore let it rest upon thy pillow . ”</l>
     <l n="262">Herewith affrighted , Hero shrunk away ,</l>
     <l n="263">And in her lukewarm place Leander lay ;</l>
     <l n="264">Whose lively heat , like fire from heaven fet ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 35 ]</span></l>
     <l n="265">Would animate gross clay , and higher set</l>
     <l n="266">The drooping thoughts of base-declining souls ,</l>
     <l n="267">Than dreary-Mars-carousing nectar bowls .</l>
     <l n="268">His hands he cast upon her like a snare :</l>
     <l n="269">She , overcome with shame and sallow<span type="note_anchor">[ 36 ]</span>fear , 260</l>
     <l n="270">Like chaste Diana when Actæon spied her ,</l>
     <l n="271">Being suddenly betray 'd , div 'd down to hide her ;</l>
     <l n="272">And , as her silver body downward went ,</l>
     <l n="273">With both her hands she made the bed a tent ,</l>
     <l n="274">And in her own mind thought herself secure ,</l>
     <l n="275">O'ercast with dim and darksome coverture .</l>
     <l n="276">And now she lets him whisper in her ear ,</l>
     <l n="277">Flatter , entreat , promise , protest , and swear :</l>
     <l n="278">Yet ever , as he greedily assay 'd</l>
     <l n="279">To touch those dainties , she the harpy play 'd , 270</l>
     <l n="280">And every limb did , as a soldier stout ,</l>
     <l n="281">Defend the fort , and keep the foeman out ;</l>
     <l n="282">For though the rising ivory mount he scal 'd ,</l>
     <l n="283">Which is with azure circling lines empal 'd ,</l>
     <l n="284">Much like a globe ( a globe may I term this ,</l>
     <l n="285">By which Love sails to regions full of bliss ) ,</l>
     <l n="286">Yet there with Sisyphus he toil 'd in vain ,</l>
     <l n="287">Till gentle parley did the truce obtain</l>
     <l n="288">Even<span type="note_anchor">[ 37 ]</span>as a bird , which in our hands we wring ,</l>
     <l n="289">Forth plungeth , and oft flutters with her wing , 280</l>
     <l n="290">She trembling strove : this strife of hers , like that</l>
     <l n="291">Which made the world , another world begat</l>
     <l n="292">Of unknown joy . Treason was in her thought ,</l>
     <l n="293">And cunningly to yield herself she sought .</l>
     <l n="294">Seeming not won , yet won she was at length :</l>
     <l n="295">In such wars women use but half their strength .</l>
     <l n="296">Leander now , like Theban Hercules ,</l>
     <l n="297">Enter 'd the orchard of th ’ Hesperides ;</l>
     <l n="298">Whose fruit none rightly can describe , but he</l>
     <l n="299">That pulls or shakes it from the golden tree . 290</l>
     <l n="300">Wherein Leander , on her quivering breast ,</l>
     <l n="301">Breathless spoke something , and sigh 'd out the rest ;</l>
     <l n="302">Which so prevail 'd , as he with small ado ,</l>
     <l n="303">Enclos 'd her in his arms , and kiss 'd her too :</l>
     <l n="304">And every kiss to her was as a charm ,</l>
     <l n="305">And to Leander as a fresh alarm :</l>
     <l n="306">So that the truce was broke , and she , alas ,</l>
     <l n="307">Poor silly maiden , at his mercy was .</l>
     <l n="308">Love is not full of pity , as men say ,</l>
     <l n="309">But deaf and cruel where he means to prey . 300</l>
     <l n="310">And now she wish 'd this night were never done ,</l>
     <l n="311">And sigh 'd to think upon th ’ approaching sun ;</l>
     <l n="312">For much it griev 'd her that the bright day-light</l>
     <l n="313">Should know the pleasure of this blessèd night ,</l>
     <l n="314">And them , like Mars and Erycine , display<span type="note_anchor">[ 38 ]</span></l>
     <l n="315">Both in each other 's arms chain 'd as they lay .</l>
     <l n="316">Again , she knew not how to frame her look ,</l>
     <l n="317">Or speak to him , who in a moment took</l>
     <l n="318">That which so long , so charily she kept ;</l>
     <l n="319">And fain by stealth away she would have crept , 310</l>
     <l n="320">And to some corner secretly have gone ,</l>
     <l n="321">Leaving Leander in the bed alone .</l>
     <l n="322">But as her naked feet were whipping out ,</l>
     <l n="323">He on the sudden cling 'd her so about ,</l>
     <l n="324">That , mermaid-like , unto the floor she slid ;</l>
     <l n="325">One half appear 'd , the other half was hid .</l>
     <l n="326">Thus near the bed she blushing stood upright ,</l>
     <l n="327">And from her countenance behold ye might</l>
     <l n="328">A kind of twilight break , which through the air ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 39 ]</span></l>
     <l n="329">As from an orient cloud , glimps 'd<span type="note_anchor">[ 40 ]</span>here and there ; 320</l>
     <l n="330">And round about the chamber this false morn</l>
     <l n="331">Brought forth the day before the day was born .</l>
     <l n="332">So Hero 's ruddy cheek Hero betray 'd ,</l>
     <l n="333">And her all naked to his sight display 'd :</l>
     <l n="334">Whence his admiring eyes more pleasure took</l>
     <l n="335">Than Dis ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 41 ]</span>on heaps of gold fixing his look .</l>
     <l n="336">By this , Apollo 's golden harp began</l>
     <l n="337">To sound forth music to the ocean ;</l>
     <l n="338">Which watchful Hesperus no sooner heard ,</l>
     <l n="339">But he the bright Day-bearing car<span type="note_anchor">[ 42 ]</span>prepar 'd , 330</l>
     <l n="340">And ran before , as harbinger of light ,</l>
     <l n="341">And with his flaring beams mock 'd ugly Night ,</l>
     <l n="342">Till she , o'ercome with anguish , shame , and rage ,</l>
     <l n="343">Dang 'd<span type="note_anchor">[ 43 ]</span>down to hell her loathsome carriage .</l>

   <p>THE EPISTLE<span type="note_anchor">[ 44 ]</span>DEDICATORY</p>
   <p>TO MY</p>
   <p>BEST ESTEEMED AND WORTHILY HONOURED LADY THE</p>
   <p>LADY WALSINGHAM ,</p>
   <p>ONE OF THE LADIES OF HER MAJESTY 'S BED-CHAMBER .</p>
   <p>I present your ladyship with the last affections of the first two Lovers that ever Muse shrined in the Temple of Memory ; being drawn by strange instigation to employ some of my serious time in so trifling a subject , which yet made the first Author , divine Musaeus , eternal . And were it not that we must subject our accounts of these common received conceits to servile custom , it goes much against my hand to sign that for a trifling subject on which more worthiness of soul hath been shewed , and weight of divine wit , than can vouchsafe residence in the leaden gravity of any money-monger ; in whose profession all serious subjects are concluded . But he that shuns trifles must shun the world ; out of whose reverend heaps of substance and austerity I can and will ere long single or tumble out as brainless and passionate fooleries as ever panted in the bosom of the most ridiculous lover . Accept it , therefore , good Madam , though as a trifle , yet as a serious argument of my affection ; for to be thought thankful for all free and honourable favours is a great sum of that riches my whole thrift intendeth .</p>
   <p>Such uncourtly and silly dispositions as mine , whose contentment hath other objects than profit or glory , are as glad , simply for the naked merit of virtue , to honour such as advance her , as others that are hard to commend with deepliest politique bounty .</p>
   <p>It hath therefore adjoined much contentment to my desire of your true honour to hear men of desert in court add to mine own knowledge of your noble disposition how gladly you do your best to prefer their desires , and have as absolute respect to their mere good parts as if they came perfumed and charmed with golden incitements . And this most sweet inclination , that flows from the truth and eternity of Nobles [ se ] , assure your Ladyship doth more suit your other ornaments , and makes more to the advancement of your name and happiness of your proceedings , than if like others you displayed ensigns of state and sourness in your forehead , made smooth with nothing but sensuality and presents .</p>
   <p>This poor Dedication ( in figure of the other unity betwixt Sir Thomas and yourself ) hath rejoined you with him , my honoured best friend ; whose continuance of ancient kindness to my still-obscured estate , though it cannot increase my love to him which hath been entirely circular ; yet shall it encourage my deserts to their utmost requital , and make my hearty gratitude speak ; to which the unhappiness of my life hath hitherto been uncomfortable and painful dumbness .</p>
   <p>By your Ladyship 's vowed in</p>
   <p>most wished service ,</p>

     <l n="142">The snaky paths to each observèd law</l>
     <l n="143">Did Policy in her broad bosom draw . 130</l>
     <l n="144">One hand a mathematic crystal sways ,</l>

     <l n="158">Thus she appear 'd , and sharply did reprove</l>
     <l n="159">Leander 's bluntness in his violent love ;</l>
     <l n="160">Told him how poor was substance without rites ,</l>
     <l n="161">Like bills unsign 'd ; desires without delights ;</l>
     <l n="162">Like meats unseason 'd ; like rank corn that grows</l>

     <l n="168">She vanish 'd , leaving pierc 'd Leander 's heart</l>
     <l n="169">With sense of his unceremonious part ,</l>
     <l n="170">In which , with plain neglect of nuptial rites ,</l>
     <l n="171">He close and flatly fell to his delights :</l>
     <l n="172">And instantly he vow 'd to celebrate</l>
     <l n="173">All rites pertaining to his married state . 160</l>
     <l n="174">So up he gets , and to his father goes ,</l>

     <l n="316">Or like a scorchèd statue made a coal</l>
     <l n="317">With three-wing 'd lightning , or a wretched soul</l>
     <l n="318">Muffled with endless darkness , she did sit :</l>
     <l n="319">The night had never such a heavy spirit .</l>
     <l n="320">Yet might a penetrating<span type="note_anchor">[ 63 ]</span>eye well see</l>
     <l n="321">How fast her clear tears melted on her knee</l>
     <l n="322">Through her black veil , and turn 'd as black as it ,</l>
     <l n="323">Mourning to be her tears . Then wrought her wit 310</l>
     <l n="324">With her broke vow , her goddess ’ wrath , her fame ,—</l>
     <l n="325">All tools that enginous<span type="note_anchor">[ 64 ]</span>despair could frame :</l>
     <l n="326">Which made her strew the floor with her torn hair ,</l>
     <l n="327">And spread her mantle piece-meal in the air .</l>
     <l n="328">Like Jove 's son 's club , strong passion struck her down ,</l>
     <l n="329">And with a piteous shriek enforc 'd her swoun :</l>
     <l n="330">Her shriek made with another shriek ascend</l>
     <l n="331">The frighted matron that on her did tend ;</l>
     <l n="332">And as with her own cry her sense was slain ,</l>
     <l n="333">So with the other it was called again . 320</l>
     <l n="334">She rose , and to her bed made forcèd way ,</l>
     <l n="335">And laid her down even where Leander lay ;</l>
     <l n="336">And all this while the red sea of her blood</l>
     <l n="337">Ebb 'd with Leander : but now turn 'd the flood ,</l>
     <l n="338">And all her fleet of spirits came swelling in ,</l>
     <l n="339">With child<span type="note_anchor">[ 65 ]</span>of sail , and did hot fight begin</l>
     <l n="340">With those severe conceits she too much marked :</l>
     <l n="341">And here Leander 's beauties were embarked .</l>
     <l n="342">He came in swimming , painted all with joys ,</l>
     <l n="343">Such as might sweeten hell : his thought destroys 330</l>
     <l n="344">All her destroying thoughts ; she thought she felt</l>
     <l n="345">His heart in hers , with her contentions melt ,</l>
     <l n="346">And chide her soul that it could so much err ,</l>
     <l n="347">To check the true joys he deserved in her .</l>
     <l n="348">Her fresh-heat blood cast figures in her eyes ,</l>
     <l n="349">And she suppos 'd she saw in Neptune 's skies</l>
     <l n="350">How her star wander 'd , wash 'd in smarting brine ,</l>
     <l n="351">For her love 's sake , that with immortal wine</l>
     <l n="352">Should be embath 'd , and swim in more heart's-ease</l>
     <l n="353">Than there was water in the Sestian seas . 340</l>
     <l n="354">Then said her Cupid-prompted spirit , “ Shall I</l>

     <l n="413">Her health said she must live ; her sex , dissemble . 400</l>
     <l n="414">She viewed Leander 's place , and wished he were</l>
     <l n="415">Turned to his place , so his place were Leander .</l>
     <l n="416">“ Ay me , ” said she , “ that love 's sweet life and sense</l>

     <l n="422">His motion is , like heaven 's , orbicular ,</l>
     <l n="423">For where he once is , he is ever there . 410</l>
     <l n="424">This place was mine ; Leander , now ‘ tis thine ;</l>

     <l n="44">Her plenteous hair in curlèd billows swims</l>
     <l n="45">On her bright shoulder : her harmonious limbs</l>
     <l n="46">Sustained no more but a most subtile veil ,</l>
     <l n="47">That hung on them , as it durst not assail</l>
     <l n="48">Their different concord ; for the weakest air</l>
     <l n="49">Could raise it swelling from her beauties fair ; 30</l>
     <l n="50">Nor did it cover , but adumbrate only</l>
     <l n="51">Her most heart-piercing parts , that a blest eye</l>
     <l n="52">Might see , as it did shadow , fearfully ,</l>
     <l n="53">All that all-love-deserving paradise :</l>
     <l n="54">It was as blue as the most freezing skies ;</l>
     <l n="55">Near the sea 's hue , for thence her goddess came :</l>
     <l n="56">On it a scarf she wore of wondrous frame ;</l>
     <l n="57">In midst whereof she wrought a virgin 's face ,</l>
     <l n="58">From whose each cheek a fiery blush did chase</l>
     <l n="59">Two crimson flames , that did two ways extend , 40</l>
     <l n="60">Spreading the ample scarf to either end ;</l>
     <l n="61">Which figur 'd the division of her mind ,</l>
     <l n="62">Whiles yet she rested bashfully inclin 'd ,</l>
     <l n="63">And stood not resolute to wed Leander ;</l>
     <l n="64">This serv 'd her white neck for a purple sphere ,</l>
     <l n="65">And cast itself at full breadth down her back :</l>
     <l n="66">There , since the first breath that begun the wrack</l>
     <l n="67">Of her free quiet from Leander 's lips ,</l>
     <l n="68">She wrought a sea , in one flame , full of ships ;</l>
     <l n="69">But that one ship where all her wealth did pass , 50</l>
     <l n="70">Like simple merchants ’ goods , Leander was ;</l>
     <l n="71">For in that sea she naked figured him ;</l>
     <l n="72">Her diving needle taught him how to swim ,</l>
     <l n="73">And to each thread did such resemblance give ,</l>
     <l n="74">For joy to be so like him it did live :</l>
     <l n="75">Things senseless live by art , and rational die</l>
     <l n="76">By rude contempt of art and industry .</l>
     <l n="77">Scarce could she work , but , in her strength of thought ,</l>
     <l n="78">She fear 'd she prick 'd Leander as she wrought ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 71 ]</span></l>
     <l n="79">And oft would shriek so , that her guardian , frighted , 60</l>
     <l n="80">Would startling haste , as with some mischief cited :</l>
     <l n="81">They double life that dead things ’ griefs sustain ;</l>
     <l n="82">They kill that feel not their friends ’ living pain .</l>
     <l n="83">Sometimes she fear 'd he sought her infamy ;</l>
     <l n="84">And then , as she was working of his eye ,</l>
     <l n="85">She thought to prick it out to quench her ill ;</l>
     <l n="86">But , as she prick 'd , it grew more perfect still :</l>
     <l n="87">Trifling attempts no serious acts advance ;</l>
     <l n="88">The fire of love is blown by dalliance .</l>
     <l n="89">In working his fair neck she did so grace it , 70</l>
     <l n="90">She still was working her own arms t ’ embrace it :</l>
     <l n="91">That , and his shoulders , and his hands were seen</l>
     <l n="92">Above the stream ; and with a pure sea-green</l>
     <l n="93">She did so quaintly shadow every limb ,</l>
     <l n="94">All might be seen beneath the waves to swim .</l>
     <l n="95">In this conceited scarf she wrought beside</l>
     <l n="96">A moon in change , and shooting stars did glide</l>
     <l n="97">In number after her with bloody beams ;</l>
     <l n="98">Which figur 'd her affects<span type="note_anchor">[ 72 ]</span>in their extremes ,</l>
     <l n="99">Pursuing nature in her Cynthian body , 80</l>
     <l n="100">And did her thoughts running on change imply ;</l>
     <l n="101">For maids take more delight , when they prepare ,</l>
     <l n="102">And think of wives ’ states , than when wives they are .</l>
     <l n="103">Beneath all these she wrought a fisherman ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 73 ]</span></l>
     <l n="104">Drawing his nets from forth the ocean ;</l>
     <l n="105">Who drew so hard , ye might discover well</l>
     <l n="106">The toughen 'd sinews in his neck did swell :</l>
     <l n="107">His inward strains drave out his blood-shot eyes ,</l>
     <l n="108">And springs of sweat did in his forehead rise ;</l>
     <l n="109">Yet was of naught but of a serpent sped , 90</l>
     <l n="110">That in his bosom flew and stung him dead :</l>
     <l n="111">And this by Fate into her mind was sent ,</l>
     <l n="112">Not wrought by mere instinct of her intent .</l>
     <l n="113">At the scarf 's other end her hand did frame ,</l>
     <l n="114">Near the fork 'd point of the divided flame ,</l>
     <l n="115">A country virgin keeping of a vine ,</l>
     <l n="116">Who did of hollow bulrushes combine</l>
     <l n="117">Snares for the stubble-loving grasshopper ,</l>
     <l n="118">And by her lay her scrip that nourish 'd her .</l>
     <l n="119">Within a myrtle shade she sate and sung ; 100</l>
     <l n="120">And tufts of waving reeds above her sprung ,</l>
     <l n="121">Where lurked two foxes , that , while she applied</l>
     <l n="122">Her trifling snares , their thieveries did divide ,</l>
     <l n="123">One to the vine , another to her scrip ,</l>
     <l n="124">That she did negligently overslip ;</l>
     <l n="125">By which her fruitful vine and wholesome fare</l>
     <l n="126">She suffered spoiled to make a childish snare .</l>
     <l n="127">These ominous fancies did her soul express ,</l>
     <l n="128">And every finger made a prophetess ,</l>
     <l n="129">To show what death was hid in love 's disguise , 110</l>
     <l n="130">And make her judgment conquer Destinies .</l>
     <l n="131">O , what sweet forms fair ladies ’ souls do shroud ,</l>
     <l n="132">Were they made seen and forcèd through their blood ;</l>
     <l n="133">If through their beauties , like rich work through lawn ,</l>
     <l n="134">They would set forth their minds with virtues drawn ,</l>
     <l n="135">In letting graces from their fingers fly ,</l>
     <l n="136">To still their eyas<span type="note_anchor">[ 74 ]</span>thoughts with industry ;</l>
     <l n="137">That their plied wits in numbered silks might sing</l>
     <l n="138">Passion 's huge conquest , and their needles<span type="note_anchor">[ 75 ]</span>leading</l>
     <l n="139">Affection prisoner through their own-built cities , 120</l>
     <l n="140">Pinioned with stones and Arachnean ditties .</l>
     <l n="141">Proceed we now with Hero 's sacrifice :</l>
     <l n="142">She odours burned , and from their smoke did rise</l>
     <l n="143">Unsavoury fumes , that air with plagues inspired ;</l>
     <l n="144">And then the consecrated sticks she fired .</l>
     <l n="145">On whose pale flames an angry spirit flew ,</l>
     <l n="146">And beat it down still as it upward grew ;</l>
     <l n="147">The virgin tapers that on th ’ altar stood ,</l>
     <l n="148">When she inflam 'd them , burned as red as blood ;<span type="note_anchor">[ 76 ]</span></l>
     <l n="149">All sad ostents of that too near success ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 77 ]</span>130</l>
     <l n="150">That made such moving beauties motionless .</l>
     <l n="151">Then Hero wept ; but her affrighted eyes</l>
     <l n="152">She quickly wrested from the sacrifice ,</l>
     <l n="153">Shut them , and inwards for Leander looked ,</l>
     <l n="154">Search 'd her soft bosom , and from thence she plucked</l>
     <l n="155">His lovely picture ; which when she had viewed ,</l>
     <l n="156">Her beauties were with all love 's joys renewed ;</l>
     <l n="157">The odours sweeten 'd , and the fires burned clear ,</l>
     <l n="158">Leander 's form left no ill object there :</l>
     <l n="159">Such was his beauty , that the force of light , 140</l>
     <l n="160">Whose knowledge teacheth wonders infinite ,</l>
     <l n="161">The strength of number and proportion ,</l>
     <l n="162">Nature had placed in it to make it known ,</l>
     <l n="163">Art was her daughter , and what human wits</l>
     <l n="164">For study lost , entombed in drossy spirits .</l>
     <l n="165">After this accident ( which for her glory</l>
     <l n="166">Hero could not but make a history ) ,</l>
     <l n="167">Th ’ inhabitants of Sestos and Abydos</l>
     <l n="168">Did every year , with feasts propitious ,</l>
     <l n="169">To fair Leander 's picture sacrifice : 150</l>
     <l n="170">And they were persons of especial price</l>
     <l n="171">That were allowed it , as an ornament</l>
     <l n="172">T ’ enrich their houses , for the continent</l>
     <l n="173">Of the strange virtues all approved it held ;</l>
     <l n="174">For even the very look of it repelled</l>
     <l n="175">All blastings , witchcrafts , and the strifes of nature</l>
     <l n="176">In those diseases that no herbs could cure ;</l>
     <l n="177">The wolfy sting of avarice it would pull ,</l>
     <l n="178">And make the rankest miser bountiful ;</l>
     <l n="179">It kill 'd the fear of thunder and of death ; 160</l>
     <l n="180">The discords that conceit engendereth</l>
     <l n="181">‘ Twixt man and wife , it for the time would cease ;</l>
     <l n="182">The flames of love it quench 'd , and would increase ;</l>
     <l n="183">Held in a prince 's hand , it would put out</l>
     <l n="184">The dreadful'st comet ; it would ease<span type="note_anchor">[ 78 ]</span>all doubt</l>
     <l n="185">Of threaten 'd mischiefs ; it would bring asleep</l>
     <l n="186">Such as were mad ; it would enforce to weep</l>
     <l n="187">Most barbarous eyes ; and many more effects</l>
     <l n="188">This picture wrought , and sprung<span type="note_anchor">[ 79 ]</span>Leandrian<span type="note_anchor">[ 80 ]</span>sects ;</l>
     <l n="189">Of which was Hero first ; for he whose form , 170</l>
     <l n="190">Held in her hand , clear 'd such a fatal storm ,</l>
     <l n="191">From hell she thought his person would defend her ,</l>
     <l n="192">Which night and Hellespont would quickly send her .</l>
     <l n="193">With this confirm 'd , she vow 'd to banish quite</l>
     <l n="194">All thought of any check to her delight ;</l>
     <l n="195">And , in contempt of silly bashfulness ,</l>
     <l n="196">She would the faith of her desires profess ,</l>
     <l n="197">Where her religion should be policy ,</l>
     <l n="198">To follow love with zeal her piety ;</l>
     <l n="199">Her chamber her cathedral-church should be , 180</l>
     <l n="200">And her Leander her chief deity ;</l>
     <l n="201">For in her love these did the gods forego ;</l>
     <l n="202">And though her knowledge did not teach her so ,</l>
     <l n="203">Yet did it teach her this , that what her heart</l>
     <l n="204">Did greatest hold in her self-greatest part ,</l>
     <l n="205">That she did make her god ; and ‘ twas less naught</l>
     <l n="206">To leave gods in profession and in thought ,</l>
     <l n="207">Than in her love and life ; for therein lies</l>
     <l n="208">Most of her duties and their dignities ;</l>
     <l n="209">And , rail the brain-bald world at what it will , 190</l>
     <l n="210">That 's the grand atheism that reigns in it still .</l>
     <l n="211">Yet singularity she would use no more ,</l>
     <l n="212">For she was singular too much before ;</l>
     <l n="213">But she would please the world with fair pretext :</l>
     <l n="214">Love would not leave her conscience perplext :</l>
     <l n="215">Great men that will have less do for them , still</l>
     <l n="216">Must bear them out , though th ’ acts be ne'er so ill ;</l>
     <l n="217">Meanness must pander be to Excellence ;</l>
     <l n="218">Pleasure atones Falsehood and Conscience :</l>
     <l n="219">Dissembling was the worst , thought Hero then , 200</l>
     <l n="220">And that was best , now she must live with men .</l>
     <l n="221">O virtuous love , that taught her to do best</l>
     <l n="222">When she did worst , and when she thought it least !</l>
     <l n="223">Thus would she still proceed in works divine ,</l>
     <l n="224">And in her sacred state of priesthood shine ,</l>
     <l n="225">Handling the holy rites with hands as bold ,</l>
     <l n="226">As if therein she did Jove 's thunder hold ,</l>
     <l n="227">And need not fear those menaces of error ,</l>
     <l n="228">Which she at others threw with greatest terror .</l>
     <l n="229">O lovely Hero , nothing is thy sin , 210</l>
     <l n="230">Weigh 'd with those foul faults other priests are in !</l>
     <l n="231">That having neither faiths , nor works , nor beauties ,</l>
     <l n="232">T ’ engender any ‘ scuse for slubbered<span type="note_anchor">[ 81 ]</span>duties ,</l>
     <l n="233">With as much countenance fill their holy chairs ,</l>
     <l n="234">And sweat denouncements ‘ gainst profane affairs ,</l>
     <l n="235">As if their lives were cut out by their places ,</l>
     <l n="236">And they the only fathers of the graces .</l>
     <l n="237">Now , as with settled mind she did repair</l>
     <l n="238">Her thoughts to sacrifice her ravished hair</l>
     <l n="239">And her torn robe , which on the altar lay , 220</l>
     <l n="240">And only for religion 's fire did stay ,</l>
     <l n="241">She heard a thunder by the Cyclops beaten ,</l>
     <l n="242">In such a volley as the world did threaten ,</l>
     <l n="243">Given Venus as she parted th ’ airy sphere ,</l>
     <l n="244">Descending now to chide with Hero here :</l>
     <l n="245">When suddenly the goddess ’ waggoners ,</l>
     <l n="246">The swans and turtles that , in coupled pheres ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 82 ]</span></l>
     <l n="247">Through all worlds ’ bosoms draw her influence ,</l>
     <l n="248">Lighted in Hero 's window , and from thence</l>
     <l n="249">To her fair shoulders flew the gentle doves ,— 230</l>
     <l n="250">Graceful Ædone<span type="note_anchor">[ 83 ]</span>that sweet pleasure loves ,</l>
     <l n="251">And ruff-foot Chreste<span type="note_anchor">[ 84 ]</span>with the tufted crown ;</l>
     <l n="252">Both which did kiss her , though their goddess frown .</l>
     <l n="253">The swans did in the solid flood , her glass ,</l>
     <l n="254">Proin<span type="note_anchor">[ 85 ]</span>their fair plumes ; of which the fairest was</l>
     <l n="255">Jove-lov 'd Leucote ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 86 ]</span>that pure brightness is ;</l>
     <l n="256">The other bounty-loving Dapsilis .<span type="note_anchor">[ 87 ]</span></l>
     <l n="257">All were in heaven , now they with Hero were :</l>
     <l n="258">But Venus ’ looks brought wrath , and urgèd fear .</l>
     <l n="259">Her robe was scarlet ; black her head 's attire : 240</l>
     <l n="260">And through her naked breast shin 'd streams of fire ,</l>
     <l n="261">As when the rarifièd air is driven</l>
     <l n="262">In flashing streams , and opes the darken 'd heaven .</l>
     <l n="263">In her white hand a wreath of yew she bore ;</l>
     <l n="264">And , breaking th ’ icy wreath sweet Hero wore ,</l>
     <l n="265">She forc 'd about her brows her wreath of yew ,</l>
     <l n="266">And said , “ Now , minion , to thy fate be true ,</l>
     <l n="267">Though not to me ; endure what this portends :</l>
     <l n="268">Begin where lightness will , in shame it ends .</l>
     <l n="269">Love makes thee cunning ; thou art current now , 250</l>
     <l n="270">By being counterfeit : thy broken vow</l>
     <l n="271">Deceit with her pied garters must rejoin ,</l>
     <l n="272">And with her stamp thou countenances must coin ;</l>
     <l n="273">Coyness , and pure<span type="note_anchor">[ 88 ]</span>deceits , for purities ,</l>
     <l n="274">And still a maid wilt seem in cozen 'd eyes ,</l>
     <l n="275">And have an antic face to laugh within ,</l>
     <l n="276">While thy smooth looks make men digest thy sin .</l>
     <l n="277">But since thy lips ( least thought forsworn ) forswore ,</l>
     <l n="278">Be never virgin 's vow worth trusting more ! ”</l>
     <l n="279">When Beauty 's dearest did her goddess hear 260</l>
     <l n="280">Breathe such rebukes ‘ gainst that she could not clear ,</l>
     <l n="281">Dumb sorrow spake aloud in tears and blood ,</l>
     <l n="282">That from her grief-burst veins , in piteous flood ,</l>
     <l n="283">From the sweet conduits of her favour fell .</l>
     <l n="284">The gentle turtles did with moans make swell</l>
     <l n="285">Their shining gorges ; the while black-ey 'd swans</l>
     <l n="286">Did sing as woful epicedians ,</l>
     <l n="287">As they would straightways die : when Pity 's queen ,</l>
     <l n="288">The goddess Ecte ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 89 ]</span>that had ever been</l>
     <l n="289">Hid in a watery cloud near Hero 's cries , 270</l>
     <l n="290">Since the first instant of her broken eyes ,</l>
     <l n="291">Gave bright Leucote voice , and made her speak ,</l>
     <l n="292">To ease her anguish , whose swoln breast did break</l>
     <l n="293">With anger at her goddess , that did touch</l>
     <l n="294">Hero so near for that she us 'd so much ;</l>
     <l n="295">And , thrusting her white neck at Venus , said :</l>
     <l n="296">“ Why may not amorous Hero seem a maid ,</l>
     <l n="297">Though she be none , as well as you suppress</l>
     <l n="298">In modest cheeks your inward wantonness ?</l>
     <l n="299">How often have we drawn you from above , 280</l>
     <l n="300">T ’ exchange with mortals rites for rites in love !</l>
     <l n="301">Why in your priest , then , call you that offence ,</l>
     <l n="302">That shines in you , and is<span type="note_anchor">[ 90 ]</span>your influence ? ”</l>
     <l n="303">With this , the Furies stopp 'd Leucote 's lips ,</l>
     <l n="304">Enjoin 'd by Venus ; who with rosy whips</l>
     <l n="305">Beat the kind bird . Fierce lightning from her eyes</l>
     <l n="306">Did set on fire fair Hero 's sacrifice ,</l>
     <l n="307">Which was her torn robe and enforcèd hair ;</l>
     <l n="308">And the bright flame became a maid most fair</l>
     <l n="309">For her aspèct : her tresses were of wire , 290</l>
     <l n="310">Knit like a net , where hearts set all on fire ,</l>
     <l n="311">Struggled in pants , and could not get releast ;</l>
     <l n="312">Her arms were all with golden pincers drest ,</l>
     <l n="313">And twenty-fashioned knots , pulleys , and brakes ,</l>
     <l n="314">And all her body girt with painted snakes ;</l>
     <l n="315">Her down-parts in a scorpion 's tail combined ,</l>
     <l n="316">Freckled with twenty colours ; pied wings shined</l>
     <l n="317">Out of her shoulders ; cloth had never dye ,</l>
     <l n="318">Nor sweeter colours never viewèd eye ,</l>
     <l n="319">In scorching Turkey , Cares , Tartary , 300</l>
     <l n="320">Than shined about this spirit notorious ;</l>
     <l n="321">Nor was Arachne 's web so glorious .</l>
     <l n="322">Of lightning and of shreds she was begot ;</l>
     <l n="323">More hold in base dissemblers is there not .</l>
     <l n="324">Her name was Eronusis .<span type="note_anchor">[ 91 ]</span>Venus flew</l>
     <l n="325">From Hero 's sight , and at her chariot drew</l>
     <l n="326">This wondrous creature to so steep a height ,</l>
     <l n="327">That all the world she might command with sleight</l>
     <l n="328">Of her gay wings ; and then she bade her haste ,—</l>
     <l n="329">Since Hero had dissembled , and disgraced 310</l>
     <l n="330">Her rites so much ,— and every breast infect</l>
     <l n="331">With her deceits : she made her architect</l>
     <l n="332">Of all dissimulation ; and since then</l>
     <l n="333">Never was any trust in maids or men .</l>
     <l n="334">O , it spited</l>
     <l n="335">Fair Venus ’ heart to see her most delighted ,</l>
     <l n="336">And one she choos 'd , for temper of her mind</l>
     <l n="337">To be the only ruler of her kind ,</l>
     <l n="338">So soon to let her virgin race be ended !</l>
     <l n="339">Not simply for the fault a whit offended , 320</l>
     <l n="340">But that in strife for chasteness with the Moon ,</l>
     <l n="341">Spiteful Diana bade her show but one</l>
     <l n="342">That was her servant vow 'd , and liv 'd a maid ;</l>
     <l n="343">And , now she thought to answer that upbraid ,</l>
     <l n="344">Hero had lost her answer : who knows not</l>
     <l n="345">Venus would seem as far from any spot</l>
     <l n="346">Of light demeanour , as the very skin</l>
     <l n="347">‘ Twixt Cynthia 's brows ? sin is asham 'd of sin .</l>
     <l n="348">Up Venus flew , and scarce durst up for fear</l>
     <l n="349">Of Phoebe 's laughter , when she pass 'd her sphere : 330</l>
     <l n="350">And so most ugly-clouded was the light ,</l>
     <l n="351">That day was hid in day ; night came ere night ;</l>
     <l n="352">And Venus could not through the thick air pierce ,</l>
     <l n="353">Till the day 's king , god of undaunted verse ,</l>
     <l n="354">Because she was so plentiful a theme</l>
     <l n="355">To such as wore his laurel anademe .</l>
     <l n="356">Like to a fiery bullet made descent ,</l>
     <l n="357">And from her passage those fat vapours rent ,</l>
     <l n="358">That being not throughly rarified to rain ,</l>
     <l n="359">Melted like pitch , as blue as any vein ; 340</l>
     <l n="360">And scalding tempests made the earth to shrink</l>
     <l n="361">Under their fervour , and the world did think</l>
     <l n="362">In every drop a torturing spirit flew ,</l>
     <l n="363">It pierc 'd so deeply , and it burn 'd so blue .</l>
     <l n="364">Betwixt all this and Hero , Hero held</l>
     <l n="365">Leander 's picture , as a Persian shield ;</l>
     <l n="366">And she was free from fear of worst success :</l>
     <l n="367">The more ill threats us , we suspect the less :</l>
     <l n="368">As we grow hapless , violence subtle grows ,</l>
     <l n="369">Dumb , deaf , and blind , and comes when no man knows . 350</l>

     <l n="2">Day doubles his accustom 'd date ,</l>
     <l n="3">As loath the Night , incens 'd by Fate ,</l>
     <l n="4">Should wreck our lovers . Hero 's plight ;</l>
     <l n="5">Longs for Leander and the night :</l>
     <l n="6">Which ere her thirsty wish recovers ,</l>
     <l n="7">She sends for two betrothèd lovers ,</l>
     <l n="8">And marries them , that , with their crew ,</l>
     <l n="9">Their sports , and ceremonies due ,</l>
     <l n="10">She covertly might celebrate ,</l>
     <l n="11">With secret joy her own estate . 10</l>
     <l n="12">She makes a feast , at which appears</l>
     <l n="13">The wild nymph Teras , that still bears</l>
     <l n="14">An ivory lute , tells ominous tales ,</l>
     <l n="15">And sings at solemn festivals .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="16">Now was bright Hero weary of the day ,</l>
     <l n="17">Thought an Olympiad in Leander 's stay .</l>
     <l n="18">Sol and the soft-foot Hours hung on his arms ,</l>
     <l n="19">And would not let him swim , foreseeing his harms :</l>
     <l n="20">That day Aurora double grace obtain 'd</l>
     <l n="21">Of her love Phoebus ; she his horses reign 'd ,</l>
     <l n="22">Set<span type="note_anchor">[ 92 ]</span>on his golden knee , and , as she list ,</l>
     <l n="23">She pull 'd him back ; and as she pull 'd she kiss 'd ,</l>
     <l n="24">To have him turn to bed : he lov 'd her more ,</l>
     <l n="25">To see the love Leander Hero bore : 10</l>
     <l n="26">Examples profit much ; ten times in one ,</l>
     <l n="27">In persons full of note , good deeds are done .</l>
     <l n="28">Day was so long , men walking fell asleep ;</l>
     <l n="29">The heavy humours that their eyes did steep</l>
     <l n="30">Made them fear mischiefs . The hard streets were beds</l>
     <l n="31">For covetous churls and for ambitious heads ,</l>
     <l n="32">That , spite of Nature , would their business ply :</l>
     <l n="33">All thought they had the falling epilepsy ,</l>
     <l n="34">Men grovell 'd so upon the smother 'd ground ;</l>
     <l n="35">And pity did the heart of Heaven confound . 20</l>
     <l n="36">The Gods , the Graces , and the Muses came</l>
     <l n="37">Down to the Destinies , to stay the frame</l>
     <l n="38">Of the true lovers ’ deaths , and all world 's tears :</l>
     <l n="39">But Death before had stopp 'd their cruel ears .</l>
     <l n="40">All the celestials parted mourning then ,</l>
     <l n="41">Pierc 'd with our human miseries more than men :</l>
     <l n="42">Ah , nothing doth the world with mischief fill ,</l>
     <l n="43">But want of feeling one another 's ill !</l>
     <l n="44">With their descent the day grew something fair ,</l>
     <l n="45">And cast a brighter robe upon the air . 30</l>
     <l n="46">Hero , to shorten time with merriment ,</l>
     <l n="47">For young Alcmane<span type="note_anchor">[ 93 ]</span>and bright Mya sent ,</l>
     <l n="48">Two lovers that had long crav 'd marriage-dues</l>
     <l n="49">At Hero 's hands : but she did still refuse ;</l>
     <l n="50">For lovely Mya was her consort vow 'd</l>
     <l n="51">In her maid state , and therefore not allow 'd</l>
     <l n="52">To amorous nuptials : yet fair Hero now</l>
     <l n="53">Intended to dispense with her cold vow ,</l>
     <l n="54">Since hers was broken , and to marry her :</l>
     <l n="55">The rites would pleasing matter minister 40</l>
     <l n="56">To her conceits , and shorten tedious day .</l>
     <l n="57">They came ; sweet Music usher 'd th ’ odorous way ,</l>
     <l n="58">And wanton Air in twenty sweet forms danced</l>
     <l n="59">After her fingers ; Beauty and Love advanced</l>
     <l n="60">Their ensigns in the downless rosy faces</l>
     <l n="61">Of youths and maids led after by the Graces .</l>
     <l n="62">For all these Hero made a friendly feast ,</l>
     <l n="63">Welcom 'd them kindly , did much love protest ,</l>
     <l n="64">Winning their hearts with all the means she might .</l>
     <l n="65">That , when her fault should chance t ’ abide the light 50</l>
     <l n="66">Their loves might cover or extenuate it ,</l>
     <l n="67">And high in her worst fate make pity sit .</l>
     <l n="68">She married them ; and in the banquet came ,</l>
     <l n="69">Borne by the virgins . Hero striv 'd to frame</l>
     <l n="70">Her thoughts to mirth : ay me ! but hard it is</l>
     <l n="71">To imitate a false and forcèd bliss ;</l>
     <l n="72">Ill may a sad mind forge a merry face ,</l>
     <l n="73">Nor hath constrainèd laughter any grace .</l>
     <l n="74">Then laid she wine on cares to make them sink :</l>
     <l n="75">Who fears the threats of Fortune , let him drink .<span type="note_anchor">[ 94 ]</span>60</l>
     <l n="76">To these quick nuptials enter 'd suddenly</l>
     <l n="77">Admirèd Teras with the ebon thigh ;</l>
     <l n="78">A nymph that haunted the green Sestian groves ,</l>
     <l n="79">And would consort soft virgins in their loves ,</l>
     <l n="80">At gaysome triumphs and on solemn days ,</l>
     <l n="81">Singing prophetic elegies and lays ,</l>
     <l n="82">And fingering of a silver lute she tied</l>
     <l n="83">With black and purple scarfs by her left side .</l>
     <l n="84">Apollo gave it , and her skill withal ,</l>
     <l n="85">And she was term 'd his dwarf , she was so small : 70</l>
     <l n="86">Yet great in virtue , for his beams enclosed</l>
     <l n="87">His virtues in her ; never was proposed</l>
     <l n="88">Riddle to her , or augury , strange or new ,</l>
     <l n="89">But she resolv 'd it ; never slight tale flew</l>
     <l n="90">From her charm 'd lips without important sense ,</l>
     <l n="91">Shown in some grave succeeding consequence .</l>
     <l n="92">This little sylvan , with her songs and tales ,</l>
     <l n="93">Gave such estate to feasts and nuptials ,</l>
     <l n="94">That though ofttimes she forewent tragedies ,</l>
     <l n="95">Yet for her strangeness still she pleas 'd their eyes ; 80</l>
     <l n="96">And for her smallness they admir 'd her so ,</l>
     <l n="97">They thought her perfect born , and could not grow .</l>
     <l n="98">All eyes were on her . Hero did command</l>
     <l n="99">An altar decked with sacred state should stand</l>
     <l n="100">At the feast 's upper end , close by the bride ,</l>
     <l n="101">On which the pretty nymph might sit espied .</l>
     <l n="102">Then all were silent ; every one so hears ,</l>
     <l n="103">As all their senses climb 'd into their ears :</l>
     <l n="104">And first this amorous tale , that fitted well</l>
     <l n="105">Fair Hero and the nuptials , she did tell . 90</l>

     <l n="107">Hymen , that now is god of nuptial rites ,</l>
     <l n="108">And crowns with honour Love and his delights ,</l>
     <l n="109">Of Athens was a youth , so sweet of face ,</l>
     <l n="110">That many thought him of the female race ;</l>
     <l n="111">Such quickening brightness did his clear eyes dart ,</l>
     <l n="112">Warm went their beams to his beholder 's heart ,</l>
     <l n="113">In such pure leagues his beauties were combin 'd ,</l>
     <l n="114">That there your nuptial contracts first were signed ;</l>
     <l n="115">For as proportion , white and crimson , meet</l>
     <l n="116">In beauty 's mixture , all right clear and sweet , 100</l>
     <l n="117">The eye responsible , the golden hair ,</l>
     <l n="118">And none is held , without the other , fair ;</l>
     <l n="119">All spring together , all together fade ;</l>
     <l n="120">Such intermix 'd affections should invade</l>
     <l n="121">Two perfect lovers ; which being yet unseen ,</l>
     <l n="122">Their virtues and their comforts copied been</l>
     <l n="123">In beauty 's concord , subject to the eye ;</l>
     <l n="124">And that , in Hymen , pleased so matchlessly ,</l>
     <l n="125">That lovers were esteemed in their full grace ,</l>
     <l n="126">Like form and colour mixed in Hymen 's face ; 110</l>
     <l n="127">And such sweet concord was thought worthy then</l>
     <l n="128">Of torches , music , feasts , and greatest men :</l>
     <l n="129">So Hymen look 'd that even the chastest mind</l>
     <l n="130">He mov 'd to join in joys of sacred kind ;</l>
     <l n="131">For only now his chin 's first down consorted</l>
     <l n="132">His head 's rich fleece in golden curls contorted ;</l>
     <l n="133">And as he was so loved , he loved so too :</l>
     <l n="134">So should best beauties bound by nuptials , do .</l>
     <l n="135">Bright Eucharis , who was by all men said</l>
     <l n="136">The noblest , fairest , and the richest maid 120</l>
     <l n="137">Of all th ’ Athenian damsels , Hymen lov 'd</l>
     <l n="138">With such transmission , that his heart remov 'd</l>
     <l n="139">From his white breast to hers : but her estate ,</l>
     <l n="140">In passing his , was so interminate</l>
     <l n="141">For wealth and honour , that his love durst feed</l>
     <l n="142">On naught but sight and hearing , nor could breed</l>
     <l n="143">Hope of requital , the grand prize of love ;</l>
     <l n="144">Nor could he hear or see , but he must prove</l>
     <l n="145">How his rare beauty 's music would agree</l>
     <l n="146">With maids in consort ; therefore robbèd he 130</l>
     <l n="147">His chin of those same few first fruits it bore ,</l>
     <l n="148">And , clad in such attire as virgins wore ,</l>
     <l n="149">He kept them company , and might right well ,</l>
     <l n="150">For he did all but Eucharis excel</l>
     <l n="151">In all the fair of beauty ! yet he wanted</l>
     <l n="152">Virtue to make his own desires implanted</l>
     <l n="153">In his dear Eucharis ; for women never</l>
     <l n="154">Love beauty in their sex , but envy ever .</l>
     <l n="155">His judgment yet , that durst not suit address ,</l>
     <l n="156">Nor , past due means , presume of due success , 140</l>
     <l n="157">Reason gat Fortune in the end to speed</l>
     <l n="158">To his best prayers [ 95 ]: but strange it seemed , indeed ,</l>
     <l n="159">That Fortune should a chaste affection bless :</l>
     <l n="160">Preferment seldom graceth bashfulness .</l>
     <l n="161">Nor grac 'd it Hymen yet ; but many a dart ,</l>
     <l n="162">And many an amorous thought , enthralled<span type="note_anchor">[ 96 ]</span>his heart ,</l>
     <l n="163">Ere he obtained her ; and he sick became ,</l>
     <l n="164">Forced to abstain her sight ; and then the flame</l>
     <l n="165">Raged in his bosom . O , what grief did fill him !</l>
     <l n="166">Sight made him sick , and want of sight did kill him . 150</l>
     <l n="167">The virgins wonder 'd where Diætia stay 'd ,</l>
     <l n="168">For so did Hymen term himself , a maid .</l>
     <l n="169">At length with sickly looks he greeted them :</l>
     <l n="170">Tis strange to see ‘ gainst what an extreme stream</l>
     <l n="171">A lover strives ; poor Hymen look 'd so ill ,</l>
     <l n="172">That as in merit he increasèd still</l>
     <l n="173">By suffering much , so he in grace decreas 'd :</l>
     <l n="174">Women are most won , when men merit least :</l>
     <l n="175">If Merit look not well , Love bids stand by ;</l>
     <l n="176">Love 's special lesson is to please the eye . 160</l>
     <l n="177">And Hymen soon recovering all he lost ,</l>
     <l n="178">Deceiving still these maids , but himself most ,</l>
     <l n="179">His love and he with many virgin dames ,</l>
     <l n="180">Noble by birth , noble by beauty 's flames ,</l>
     <l n="181">Leaving the town with songs and hallow 'd lights</l>
     <l n="182">To do great Ceres Eleusina rites</l>
     <l n="183">Of zealous sacrifice , were made a prey</l>
     <l n="184">To barbarous rovers , that in ambush lay ,</l>
     <l n="185">And with rude hands enforc 'd their shining spoil ,</l>
     <l n="186">Far from the darkened city , tired with toil : 170</l>
     <l n="187">And when the yellow issue of the sky</l>
     <l n="188">Came trooping forth , jealous of cruelty</l>
     <l n="189">To their bright fellows of this under-heaven ,</l>
     <l n="190">Into a double night they saw them driven ,—</l>
     <l n="191">A horrid cave , the thieves ’ black mansion ;</l>
     <l n="192">Where , weary of the journey they had gone ,</l>
     <l n="193">Their last night 's watch , and drunk with their sweet gains ,</l>
     <l n="194">Dull Morpheus enter 'd , laden with silken chains ,</l>
     <l n="195">Stronger than iron , and bound the swelling veins</l>
     <l n="196">And tirèd senses of these lawless swains . 180</l>
     <l n="197">But when the virgin lights thus dimly burn 'd ,</l>
     <l n="198">O , what a hell was heaven in ! how they mourn 'd</l>
     <l n="199">And wrung their hands , and wound their gentle forms</l>
     <l n="200">Into the shapes of sorrow ! golden storms</l>
     <l n="201">Fell from their eyes ; as when the sun appears ,</l>
     <l n="202">And yet it rains , so show 'd their eyes their tears :</l>
     <l n="203">And , as when funeral dames watch a dead corse ,</l>
     <l n="204">Weeping about it , telling with remorse</l>
     <l n="205">What pains he felt , how long in pain he lay ,</l>
     <l n="206">How little food he ate , what he would say ; 190</l>
     <l n="207">And then mix mournful tales of other 's deaths ,</l>
     <l n="208">Smothering themselves in clouds of their own breaths ;</l>
     <l n="209">At length , one cheering other , call for wine ;</l>
     <l n="210">The golden bowl drinks tears out of their eyne ,</l>
     <l n="211">As they drink wine from it ; and round it goes ,</l>
     <l n="212">Each helping other to relieve their woes ;</l>
     <l n="213">So cast these virgins ’ beauties mutual rays ,</l>
     <l n="214">One lights another , face the face displays ;</l>
     <l n="215">Lips by reflection kissed , and hands hands shook ,</l>
     <l n="216">Even by the whiteness each of other took . 200</l>
     <l n="217">But Hymen now used friendly Morpheus ’ aid ,</l>
     <l n="218">Slew every thief , and rescued every maid :</l>
     <l n="219">And now did his enamour 'd passion take</l>
     <l n="220">Heart from his hearty deed , whose worth did make</l>
     <l n="221">His hope of bounteous Eucharis more strong ;</l>
     <l n="222">And now came Love with Proteus , who had long</l>
     <l n="223">Juggled the little god with prayers and gifts ,</l>
     <l n="224">Ran through all shapes and varied all his shifts ,</l>
     <l n="225">To win Love 's stay with him , and make him love him .</l>
     <l n="226">And when he saw no strength of sleight could move him ,</l>
     <l n="227">To make him love or stay , he nimbly turned 211</l>
     <l n="228">Into Love 's self , he so extremely burned .</l>
     <l n="229">And thus came Love , with Proteus and his power ,</l>
     <l n="230">T ’ encounter Eucharis : first , like the flower</l>
     <l n="231">That Juno 's milk did spring ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 97 ]</span>the silver lily ,</l>
     <l n="232">He fell on Hymen 's hand , who straight did spy</l>
     <l n="233">The bounteous godhead , and with wondrous joy</l>
     <l n="234">Offer 'd it Eucharis . She , wonderous coy ,</l>
     <l n="235">Drew back her hand : the subtle flower did woo it ,</l>
     <l n="236">And , drawing it near , mixed so you could not know it : 220</l>
     <l n="237">As two clear tapers mix in one their light ,</l>
     <l n="238">So did the lily and the hand their white .</l>
     <l n="239">She viewed it ; and her view the form bestows</l>
     <l n="240">Amongst her spirits ; for , as colour flows</l>
     <l n="241">From superficies of each thing we see ,</l>
     <l n="242">Even so with colours forms emitted be ;</l>
     <l n="243">And where Love 's form is , Love is ; Love is form :</l>
     <l n="244">He entered at the eye ; his sacred storm</l>
     <l n="245">Rose from the hand , Love 's sweetest instrument :</l>
     <l n="246">It stirred her blood 's sea so , that high it went , 230</l>
     <l n="247">And beat in bashful waves ‘ gainst the white shore</l>
     <l n="248">Of her divided cheeks ; it raged the more ,</l>
     <l n="249">Because the tide went ‘ gainst the haughty wind</l>
     <l n="250">Of her estate and birth : and , as we find ,</l>
     <l n="251">In fainting ebbs , the flowery Zephyr hurls</l>
     <l n="252">The green-haired Hellespont , broke in silver curls ,</l>
     <l n="253">‘ Gainst Hero 's tower ; but in his blast 's retreat ,</l>
     <l n="254">The waves obeying him , they after beat ,</l>
     <l n="255">Leaving the chalky shore a great way pale ,</l>
     <l n="256">Then moist it freshly with another gale ; 240</l>
     <l n="257">So ebbed and flowed the blood<span type="note_anchor">[ 98 ]</span>in Eucharis ’ face ,</l>
     <l n="258">Coyness and Love strived which had greatest grace ;</l>
     <l n="259">Virginity did fight on Coyness ’ side ,</l>
     <l n="260">Fear of her parent 's frowns and female pride</l>
     <l n="261">Loathing the lower place , more than it loves</l>

     <l n="264">Which scarce could so much favour yet allure</l>

     <l n="266">Action is fiery valour 's sovereign good . 250</l>
     <l n="267">But Love , once entered , wished no greater aid</l>
     <l n="268">Than he could find within ; thought thought betray 'd ;</l>
     <l n="269">The bribed , but incorrupted , garrison</l>
     <l n="270">Sung “ Io Hymen ; ” there those songs begun ,</l>

     <l n="273">That he would turn into her roughest frowns</l>
     <l n="274">To turn them out ; and thus he Hymen crowns</l>
     <l n="275">King of his thoughts , man 's greatest empery :</l>
     <l n="276">This was his first brave step to deity . 260</l>
     <l n="277">Home to the mourning city they repair ,</l>
     <l n="278">With news as wholesome as the morning air ,</l>
     <l n="279">To the sad parents of each savèd maid :</l>
     <l n="280">But Hymen and his Eucharis had laid</l>
     <l n="281">This plat<span type="note_anchor">[ 100 ]</span>to make the flame of their delight</l>
     <l n="282">Round as the moon at full , and full as bright .</l>
     <l n="283">Because the parents of chaste Eucharis</l>
     <l n="284">Exceeding Hymen 's so , might cross their bliss ;</l>
     <l n="285">And as the world rewards deserts , that law</l>
     <l n="286">Cannot assist with force ; so when they saw 270</l>
     <l n="287">Their daughter safe , take vantage of their own ,</l>
     <l n="288">Praise Hymen 's valour much , nothing bestown ;</l>
     <l n="289">Hymen must leave the virgins in a grove</l>
     <l n="290">Far off from Athens , and go first to prove ,</l>
     <l n="291">If to restore them all with fame and life ,</l>
     <l n="292">He should enjoy his dearest as his wife .</l>
     <l n="293">This told to all the maids , the most agree :</l>
     <l n="294">The riper sort , knowing what ‘ tis to be</l>
     <l n="295">The first mouth of a news so far derived ,</l>
     <l n="296">And that to hear and bear news brave folks lived . 280</l>
     <l n="297">As being a carriage special hard to bear</l>
     <l n="298">Occurrents , these occurrents being so dear ,</l>
     <l n="299">They did with grace protest , they were content</l>
     <l n="300">T ’ accost their friends with all their compliment ,</l>
     <l n="301">For Hymen 's good ; but to incur their harm ,</l>
     <l n="302">There he must pardon them . This wit went warm</l>
     <l n="303">To Adolesche 's<span type="note_anchor">[ 101 ]</span>brain , a nymph born high ,</l>
     <l n="304">Made all of voice and fire , that upwards fly :</l>
     <l n="305">Her heart and all her forces ’ nether train</l>
     <l n="306">Climb 'd to her tongue , and thither fell her brain , 290</l>
     <l n="307">Since it could go no higher ; and it must go ;</l>
     <l n="308">All powers she had , even her tongue , did so :</l>
     <l n="309">In spirit and quickness she much joy did take ,</l>
     <l n="310">And loved her tongue , only for quickness ’ sake ;</l>
     <l n="311">And she would haste and tell . The rest all stay :</l>
     <l n="312">Hymen goes one , the nymph another way ;</l>
     <l n="313">And what became of her I 'll tell at last :</l>
     <l n="314">Yet take her visage now ;— moist-lipped , long-faced ,</l>
     <l n="315">Thin like an iron wedge , so sharp and tart ,</l>
     <l n="316">As ‘ twere of purpose made to cleave Love 's heart : 300</l>
     <l n="317">Well were this lovely beauty rid of her .</l>
     <l n="318">And Hymen did at Athens now prefer</l>
     <l n="319">His welcome suit , which he with joy aspired :</l>
     <l n="320">A hundred princely youths with him retired</l>
     <l n="321">To fetch the nymphs ; chariots and music went ;</l>
     <l n="322">And home they came : heaven with applauses rent .</l>
     <l n="323">The nuptials straight proceed , whiles all the town ,</l>
     <l n="324">Fresh in their joys , might do them most renown .</l>
     <l n="325">First , gold-locked Hymen did to church repair ,</l>
     <l n="326">Like a quick offering burned in flames of hair ; 310</l>
     <l n="327">And after , with a virgin firmament</l>
     <l n="328">The godhead-proving bride attended went</l>
     <l n="329">Before them all : she looked in her command ,</l>
     <l n="330">As if form-giving Cypria 's silver hand</l>
     <l n="331">Gripped all their beauties , and crushed out one flame ;</l>
     <l n="332">She blushed to see how beauty overcame</l>
     <l n="333">The thoughts of all men . Next , before her went</l>
     <l n="334">Five lovely children , decked with ornament</l>
     <l n="335">Of her sweet colours , bearing torches by ;</l>
     <l n="336">For light was held a happy augury 320</l>
     <l n="337">Of generation , whose efficient right</l>
     <l n="338">Is nothing else but to produce to light .</l>
     <l n="339">The odd disparent number they did choose ,</l>
     <l n="340">To show the union married loves should use ,</l>
     <l n="341">Since in two equal parts it will not sever ,</l>
     <l n="342">But the midst holds one to rejoin it ever ,</l>
     <l n="343">As common to both parts : men therefore deem</l>
     <l n="344">That equal number gods do not esteem ,</l>
     <l n="345">Being authors of sweet peace and unity ,</l>
     <l n="346">But pleasing to th ’ infernal empery , 330</l>
     <l n="347">Under whose ensigns Wars and Discords fight ,</l>
     <l n="348">Since an even number you may disunite</l>
     <l n="349">In two parts equal , naught in middle left</l>
     <l n="350">To reunite each part from other reft ;</l>
     <l n="351">And five they hold in most especial prize ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 102 ]</span></l>
     <l n="352">Since ‘ tis the first odd number that doth rise</l>
     <l n="353">From the two foremost numbers ’ unity ,</l>
     <l n="354">That odd and even are ; which are two and three ;</l>
     <l n="355">For one no number is ; but thence doth flow</l>
     <l n="356">The powerful race of number . Next , did go 340</l>
     <l n="357">A noble matron , that did spinning bear</l>
     <l n="358">A huswife 's rock and spindle , and did wear</l>
     <l n="359">A wether 's skin , with all the snowy fleece ,</l>
     <l n="360">To intimate that even the daintiest piece</l>
     <l n="361">And noblest-born dame should industrious be :</l>
     <l n="362">That which does good disgraceth no degree .</l>
     <l n="363">And now to Juno 's temple they are come ,</l>
     <l n="364">Where her grave priest stood in the marriage-room :</l>
     <l n="365">On his right arm did hang a scarlet veil ,</l>
     <l n="366">And from his shoulders to the ground did trail , 350</l>
     <l n="367">On either side , ribands of white and blue :</l>
     <l n="368">With the red veil he hid the bashful hue</l>
     <l n="369">Of the chaste bride , to show the modest shame ,</l>
     <l n="370">In coupling with a man , should grace a dame .</l>
     <l n="371">Then took he the disparent silks , and tied</l>
     <l n="372">The lovers by the waists , and side to side ,</l>
     <l n="373">In token that thereafter they must bind</l>
     <l n="374">In one self-sacred knot each other 's mind .</l>
     <l n="375">Before them on an altar he presented</l>
     <l n="376">Both fire and water , which was first invented , 360</l>
     <l n="377">Since to ingenerate every human creature</l>
     <l n="378">And every other birth produc 'd by Nature ,</l>
     <l n="379">Moisture and heat must mix ; so man and wife</l>
     <l n="380">For human race must join in nuptial life .</l>
     <l n="381">Then one of Juno 's birds , the painted jay ,</l>
     <l n="382">He sacrific 'd and took the gall away ;</l>
     <l n="383">All which he did behind the altar throw ,</l>
     <l n="384">In sign no bitterness of hate should grow ,</l>
     <l n="385">‘ Twixt married loves , nor any least disdain .</l>
     <l n="386">Nothing they spake , for ‘ twas esteem 'd too plain 370</l>
     <l n="387">For the most silken mildness of a maid ,</l>
     <l n="388">To let a public audience hear it said ,</l>
     <l n="389">She boldly took the man ; and so respected</l>
     <l n="390">Was bashfulness in Athens , it erected</l>
     <l n="391">To chaste Agneia ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 103 ]</span>which is Shamefacedness ,</l>
     <l n="392">A sacred temple , holding her a goddess .</l>
     <l n="393">And now to feasts , masks , and triumphant shows ,</l>
     <l n="394">The shining troops returned , even till earth-throes</l>
     <l n="395">Brought forth with joy the thickest part of night ,</l>
     <l n="396">When the sweet nuptial song , that used to cite 380</l>
     <l n="397">All to their rest , was by Phemonöe<span type="note_anchor">[ 104 ]</span>sung ,</l>
     <l n="398">First Delphian prophetess , whose graces sprung</l>
     <l n="399">Out of the Muses ’ well : she sung before</l>
     <l n="400">The bride into her chamber ; at which door</l>
     <l n="401">A matron and a torch-bearer did stand :</l>
     <l n="402">A painted box of confits<span type="note_anchor">[ 105 ]</span>in her hand</l>
     <l n="403">The matron held , and so did other some<span type="note_anchor">[ 106 ]</span></l>
     <l n="404">That compassed round the honour 'd nuptial room .</l>
     <l n="405">The custom was , that every maid did wear ,</l>
     <l n="406">During her maidenhead , a silken sphere 390</l>
     <l n="407">About her waist , above her inmost weed ,</l>
     <l n="408">Knit with Minerva 's knot , and that was freed</l>
     <l n="409">By the fair bridegroom on the marriage-night ,</l>
     <l n="410">With many ceremonies of delight :</l>
     <l n="411">And yet eternized Hymen 's tender bride ,</l>
     <l n="412">To suffer it dissolved so , sweetly cried .</l>
     <l n="413">The maids that heard , so loved and did adore her ,</l>
     <l n="414">They wished with all their hearts to suffer for her .</l>
     <l n="415">So had the matrons , that with confits stood</l>
     <l n="416">About the chamber , such affectionate blood , 400</l>
     <l n="417">And so true feeling of her harmless pains ,</l>
     <l n="418">That every one a shower of confits rains ;</l>
     <l n="419">For which the bride-youths scrambling on the ground ,</l>
     <l n="420">In noise of that sweet hail her<span type="note_anchor">[ 107 ]</span>cries were drown 'd .</l>
     <l n="421">And thus blest Hymen joyed his gracious bride ,</l>
     <l n="422">And for his joy was after deified .</l>
     <l n="423">The saffron mirror by which Phoebus ’ love ,</l>
     <l n="424">Green Tellus , decks her , now he held above</l>
     <l n="425">The cloudy mountains : and the noble maid ,</l>

     <l n="433">To hear her dear tongue robbed of such a joy ,</l>

     <l n="65">Thus all were still to Hero 's heart 's desire ; 50</l>
     <l n="66">Who with all speed did consecrate a fire</l>

     <l n="68">To light her torch , which in such curious price</l>
     <l n="69">She held , being object to Leander 's sight ,</l>
     <l n="70">That naught but fires perfumed must give it light .</l>
     <l n="71">She loved it so , she griev 'd to see it burn ,</l>
     <l n="72">Since it would waste , and soon to ashes turn :</l>

     <l n="76">What man does good , but he consumes thereby ?</l>
     <l n="77">But thou wert loved for good , held high , given show ;</l>
     <l n="78">Poor virtue loathed for good , obscured , held low :</l>
     <l n="79">Do good , be pined ,— be deedless good , disgraced ;</l>
     <l n="80">Unless we feed on men , we let them fast .</l>
     <l n="81">Yet Hero with these thoughts her torch did spend :</l>
     <l n="82">When bees make wax , Nature doth not intend</l>
     <l n="83">It should be made a torch ; but we , that know</l>
     <l n="84">The proper virtue of it , make it so ,</l>
     <l n="85">And , when ‘ tis made , we light it : nor did Nature 70</l>

     <l n="87">Makes by her soul the best of her free<span type="note_anchor">[ 117 ]</span>state ,</l>
     <l n="88">Which without love is rude , disconsolate ,</l>
     <l n="89">And wants love 's fire to make it mild and bright ,</l>
     <l n="90">Till when , maids are but torches wanting light .</l>
     <l n="91">Thus ‘ gainst our grief , not cause of grief , we fight :</l>
     <l n="92">The right of naught is glean 'd , but the delight .</l>
     <l n="93">Up went she : but to tell how she descended ,</l>
     <l n="94">Would God she were dead , or my verse ended !</l>
     <l n="95">She was the rule of wishes , sum , and end , 80</l>
     <l n="96">For all the parts that did on love depend :</l>
     <l n="97">Yet cast the torch his brightness further forth ;</l>
     <l n="98">But what shines nearest best , holds truest worth .</l>
     <l n="99">Leander did not through such tempests swim</l>
     <l n="100">To kiss the torch , although it lighted him :</l>
     <l n="101">But all his powers in her desires awakèd ,</l>
     <l n="102">Her love and virtues clothed him richly naked .</l>
     <l n="103">Men kiss but fire that only shows pursue ;</l>
     <l n="104">Her torch and Hero , figure show and virtue .</l>
     <l n="105">Now at opposed Abydos naught was heard 90</l>
     <l n="106">But bleating flocks , and many a bellowing herd ,</l>
     <l n="107">Slain for the nuptials ; cracks of falling woods ;</l>
     <l n="108">Blows of broad axes ; pourings out of floods .</l>
     <l n="109">The guilty Hellespont was mix 'd and stained</l>
     <l n="110">With bloody torrents<span type="note_anchor">[ 118 ]</span>that the shambles rained ;</l>
     <l n="111">Not arguments of feast , but shows that bled ,</l>
     <l n="112">Foretelling that red night that followèd .</l>
     <l n="113">More blood was spilt , more honours were addrest ,</l>
     <l n="114">Than could have gracèd any happy feast ;</l>
     <l n="115">Rich banquets , triumphs , every pomp employs 100</l>
     <l n="116">His sumptuous hand ; no miser 's nuptial joys .</l>
     <l n="117">Air felt continual thunder with the noise</l>
     <l n="118">Made in the general marriage-violence ;</l>
     <l n="119">And no man knew the cause of this expense ,</l>
     <l n="120">But the two hapless lords , Leander 's sire ,</l>
     <l n="121">And poor Leander , poorest where the fire</l>
     <l n="122">Of credulous love made him most rich surmis 'd :</l>
     <l n="123">As short was he of that himself<span type="note_anchor">[ 119 ]</span>he prized ,</l>
     <l n="124">As is an empty gallant full of form ,</l>
     <l n="125">That thinks each look an act , each drop a storm , 110</l>
     <l n="126">That falls from his brave breathings ; most brought up</l>
     <l n="127">In our metropolis , and hath his cup</l>
     <l n="128">Brought after him to feasts ; and much palm bears</l>
     <l n="129">For his rare judgment in th ’ attire he wears ;</l>
     <l n="130">Hath seen the hot Low-Countries , not their heat ,</l>
     <l n="131">Observes their rampires and their buildings yet ;</l>
     <l n="132">And , for your sweet discourse with mouths , is heard</l>
     <l n="133">Giving instructions with his very beard ;</l>
     <l n="134">Hath gone with an ambassador , and been</l>
     <l n="135">A great man 's mate in travelling , even to Rhene ; 120</l>
     <l n="136">And then puts all his worth in such a face</l>
     <l n="137">As he saw brave men make , and strives for grace</l>
     <l n="138">To get his news forth : as when you descry</l>
     <l n="139">A ship , with all her sail contends to fly</l>
     <l n="140">Out of the narrow Thames with winds unapt ,</l>
     <l n="141">Now crosseth here , then there , then this way rapt ,</l>
     <l n="142">And then hath one point reach 'd , then alters all ,</l>
     <l n="143">And to another crookèd reach doth fall</l>
     <l n="144">Of half a bird-bolt 's<span type="note_anchor">[ 120 ]</span>shoot , keeping more coil</l>
     <l n="145">Than if she danc 'd upon the ocean 's toil ; 130</l>
     <l n="146">So serious is his trifling company ,</l>
     <l n="147">In all his swelling ship of vacantry</l>
     <l n="148">And so short of himself in his high thought</l>
     <l n="149">Was our Leander in his fortunes brought ,</l>
     <l n="150">And in his fort of love that he thought won ;</l>
     <l n="151">But otherwise he scorns comparison .</l>
     <l n="152">O sweet Leander , thy large worth I hide</l>
     <l n="153">In a short grave ! ill-favour 'd storms must chide</l>
     <l n="154">Thy sacred favour ;<span type="note_anchor">[ 121 ]</span>I in floods of ink</l>
     <l n="155">Must drown thy graces , which white papers drink , 140</l>
     <l n="156">Even as thy beauties did the foul black seas ;</l>
     <l n="157">I must describe the hell of thy decease ,</l>
     <l n="158">That heaven did merit : yet I needs must see</l>
     <l n="159">Our painted fools and cockhorse peasantry</l>
     <l n="160">Still , still usurp , with long lives , loves , and lust ,</l>
     <l n="161">The seats of Virtue , cutting short as dust</l>
     <l n="162">Her dear-bought issue : ill to worse converts ,</l>
     <l n="163">And tramples in the blood of all deserts .</l>
     <l n="164">Night close and silent now goes fast before</l>
     <l n="165">The captains and the soldiers to the shore , 150</l>
     <l n="166">On whom attended the appointed fleet</l>
     <l n="167">At Sestos ’ bay , that should Leander meet ,</l>
     <l n="168">Who feigned he in another ship would pass :</l>
     <l n="169">Which must not be , for no one mean there was</l>
     <l n="170">To get his love home , but the course he took .</l>
     <l n="171">Forth did his beauty for his beauty look ,</l>
     <l n="172">And saw her through her torch , as you behold</l>
     <l n="173">Sometimes within the sun a face of gold ,</l>
     <l n="174">Formed in strong thoughts , by that tradition 's force</l>
     <l n="175">That says a god sits there and guides his course . 160</l>
     <l n="176">His sister was with him ; to whom he show 'd</l>
     <l n="177">His guide by sea , and said , “ Oft have you view 'd</l>
     <l n="178">In one heaven many stars , but never yet</l>
     <l n="179">In one star many heavens till now were met .</l>
     <l n="180">See , lovely sister ! see , now Hero shines ,</l>
     <l n="181">No heaven but her appears ; each star repines ,</l>
     <l n="182">And all are clad in clouds , as if they mourned</l>
     <l n="183">To be by influence of earth out-burned .</l>
     <l n="184">Yet doth she shine , and teacheth Virtue 's train</l>
     <l n="185">Still to be constant in hell 's blackest reign , 170</l>
     <l n="186">Though even the gods themselves do so entreat them</l>
     <l n="187">As they did hate , and earth as she would eat them . ”</l>
     <l n="188">Off went his silken robe , and in he leapt ,</l>
     <l n="189">Whom the kind waves so licorously cleapt ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 122 ]</span></l>
     <l n="190">Thickening for haste , one in another , so ,</l>
     <l n="191">To kiss his skin , that he might almost go</l>
     <l n="192">To Hero 's tower , had that kind minute lasted .</l>
     <l n="193">But now the cruel Fates with Até hasted</l>
     <l n="194">To all the winds , and made them battle fight</l>
     <l n="195">Upon the Hellespont , for either 's right 180</l>
     <l n="196">Pretended to the windy monarchy ;</l>
     <l n="197">And forth they brake , the seas mixed with the sky ,</l>
     <l n="198">And tossed distressed Leander , being in hell ,</l>
     <l n="199">As high as heaven : bliss not in height doth dwell .</l>
     <l n="200">The Destinies sate dancing on the waves ,</l>
     <l n="201">To see the glorious Winds with mutual braves</l>
     <l n="202">Consume each other : O , true glass , to see</l>
     <l n="203">How ruinous ambitious statists be</l>
     <l n="204">To their own glories ! Poor Leander cried</l>
     <l n="205">For help to sea-born Venus she denied ; 190</l>
     <l n="206">To Boreas , that , for his Atthæa 's<span type="note_anchor">[ 123 ]</span>sake</l>
     <l n="207">He would some pity on his Hero take ,</l>
     <l n="208">And for his own love 's sake , on his desires ;</l>
     <l n="209">But Glory never blows cold Pity 's fires .</l>
     <l n="210">Then call 'd he Neptune , who , through all the noise ,</l>
     <l n="211">Knew with affright his wreck 'd Leander 's voice ,</l>
     <l n="212">And up he rose ; for haste his forehead hit</l>
     <l n="213">‘ Gainst heaven 's hard crystal ; his proud waves he smit</l>
     <l n="214">With his forked sceptre , that could not obey ;</l>
     <l n="215">Much greater powers than Neptune 's gave them sway . 200</l>
     <l n="216">They loved Leander so , in groans they brake</l>
     <l n="217">When they came near him ; and such space did take</l>
     <l n="218">‘ Twixt one another , loath to issue on ,</l>
     <l n="219">That in their shallow furrows earth was shown ,</l>
     <l n="220">And the poor lover took a little breath :</l>
     <l n="221">But the curst Fates sate spinning of his death</l>
     <l n="222">On every wave , and with the servile Winds</l>
     <l n="223">Tumbled them on him . And now Hero finds ,</l>
     <l n="224">By that she felt , her dear Leander 's state :</l>
     <l n="225">She wept , and prayed for him to every Fate ; 210</l>
     <l n="226">And every Wind that whipped her with her hair</l>
     <l n="227">About the face , she kissed and spake it fair ,</l>
     <l n="228">Kneeled to it , gave it drink out of her eyes</l>
     <l n="229">To quench his thirst : but still their cruelties</l>
     <l n="230">Even her poor torch envied , and rudely beat</l>
     <l n="231">The baiting<span type="note_anchor">[ 124 ]</span>flame from that dear food it eat ;</l>
     <l n="232">Dear , for it nourish 'd her Leander 's life ;</l>
     <l n="233">Which with her robe she rescued from their strife ;</l>
     <l n="234">But silk too soft was such hard hearts to break ;</l>
     <l n="235">And she , dear soul , even as her silk , faint , weak , 220</l>
     <l n="236">Could not preserve it ; out , O , out it went !</l>
     <l n="237">Leander still call 'd Neptune , that now rent</l>
     <l n="238">His brackish curls , and tore his wrinkled face ,</l>
     <l n="239">Where tears in billows did each other chase ;</l>
     <l n="240">And , burst with ruth , he hurl 'd his marble mace</l>
     <l n="241">At the stern Fates : it wounded Lachesis</l>
     <l n="242">That drew Leander 's thread , and could not miss</l>
     <l n="243">The thread itself , as it her hand did hit ,</l>

     <l n="277">Prostrate upon the weeping earth for woe ,</l>

     <l n="279">Leander brought by Neptune , bruis 'd and torn</l>
     <l n="280">With cities ’ ruins he to rocks had worn ,</l>

     <l n="287">She fell on her love 's bosom , hugged it fast ,</l>
     <l n="288">And with Leander 's name she breathed her last .</l>
     <l n="289">Neptune for pity in his arms did take them ,</l>
     <l n="290">Flung them into the air , and did awake them</l>

   <p>OVID 'S ELEGIES .</p>
   <p>All the old editions of Marlowe 's translation of the Amores are undated , and bear the imprint Middleburgh ( in various spellings ) . It is probable that the copy which Mr. Charles Edmonds discovered at Lamport Hall , Northamptonshire ( the seat of Sir Charles Isham , Bart . ) , is the earliest of extant editions . The title-page of this edition is — Epigrammes and Elegies By I. D. and C. M. At Middleborugh 12mo . After the title-page come the Epigrammata , which are signed at the end “ I. D . ” ( the initials of Sir John Davies ) . Following the Epigrammata is a copy of verses headed Ignoto , and then comes a second title-page — Certaine of Ovid 's Elegies . By C. Marlowe . At Middleborough . In his preface to a facsimile reprint of the little volume , Mr. Edmonds states his conviction that this edition , notwithstanding the imprint Middleborough , was issued at London from the press of W. Jaggard , who in 1599 printed the Passionate Pilgrime . He grounds his opinion not only on the character of the type and of the misprints , but on the fact that there would be no need for the book to be printed abroad in the first instance . It was not ( he thinks ) until after June 1599 — when ( with other books ) it was condemned by Archbishop Whitgift to be burnt — that recourse was had to the expedient of reprinting it at Middleburgh . In the notes I refer to this edition as Isham copy .</p>
   <p>The next edition , which has the same title-pages as the Isham copy — Epigrammes and Elegies by I. D. and C. M. at Middleborugh , 12mo — was certainly , to judge from its general appearance , printed abroad , and by foreigners . The text agrees in the main with that of the Isham copy , but the corruptions are more numerous . I have followed Dyce in referring to this edition as Ed . A .</p>
   <p>The Isham copy and Ed . A contain only a portion of the Elegies . The complete translation appeared in All Ovid 's Elegies : 3 Bookes . By C. M. Epigrams by I. D. At Middleborugh , 12mo . ( Ed . B ) ; and in another edition with the same title-page ( Ed . C ) . The readings of Ed . C. I have occasionally borrowed from Dyce . It is supposed that the book “ continued to be printed with Middleburgh on the title , and without date , as late as 1640 ” ( Hazlitt ) .</p>

     <l n="47">I have been wanton , therefore am perplexed ,</l>
     <l n="48">And with mistrust of the like measure vexed .</l>
     <l n="49">I and my wench oft under clothes did lurk ,</l>

     <l n="67">Constrained against thy will give it the peasant ,</l>
     <l n="68">Forbear sweet words , and be your sport unpleasant .</l>

     <l n="112">But her blear eyes , bald scalp 's thin hoary fleeces ,</l>

     <l n="2">I sit not here the noble horse to see ;</l>
     <l n="3">Yet whom thou favour'st , pray may conqueror be .</l>
     <l n="4">To sit and talk with thee I hither came ,</l>
     <l n="5">That thou may'st know with love thou mak'st me flame .</l>
     <l n="6">Thou view'st the course ; I thee : let either heed</l>
     <l n="7">What please them , and their eyes let either feed .</l>
     <l n="8">What horse-driver thou favour'st most is best ,</l>
     <l n="9">Because on him thy care doth hap to rest .</l>
     <l n="10">Such chance let me have : I would bravely run ,</l>
     <l n="11">On swift steeds mounted till the race were done . 10</l>
     <l n="12">Now would I slack the reins , now lash their hide ,</l>
     <l n="13">With wheels bent inward now the ring-turn ride ,</l>
     <l n="14">In running if I see thee , I shall stay ,</l>
     <l n="15">And from my hands the reins will slip away .</l>
     <l n="16">Ah , Pelops from his coach was almost felled ,</l>
     <l n="17">Hippodamia 's looks while he beheld !</l>
     <l n="18">Yet he attained , by her support , to have her :</l>
     <l n="19">Let us all conquer by our mistress ’ favour .</l>
     <l n="20">In vain , why fly'st back ? force conjoins us now :</l>
     <l n="21">The place 's laws this benefit allow . 20</l>
     <l n="22">But spare my wench , thou at her right hand seated ;</l>
     <l n="23">By thy sides touching ill she is entreated .<span type="note_anchor">[ 351 ]</span></l>
     <l n="24">And sit thou rounder ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 352 ]</span>that behind us see ;</l>
     <l n="25">For shame press not her back with thy hard knee .</l>
     <l n="26">But on the ground thy clothes too loosely lie :</l>
     <l n="27">Gather them up , or lift them , lo , will I .</l>
     <l n="28">Envious<span type="note_anchor">[ 353 ]</span>garments , so good legs to hide !</l>
     <l n="29">The more thou look'st , the more the gown 's envìed .</l>
     <l n="30">Swift Atalanta 's flying legs , like these ,</l>
     <l n="31">Wish in his hands grasped did Hippomenes . 30</l>
     <l n="32">Coat-tucked Diana 's legs are painted like them ,</l>
     <l n="33">When strong wild beasts , she , stronger , hunts to strike them .</l>
     <l n="34">Ere these were seen , I burnt : what will these do ?</l>
     <l n="35">Flames into flame , floods thou pour'st seas into ,</l>
     <l n="36">By these I judge ; delight me may the rest ,</l>
     <l n="37">Which lie hid , under her thin veil supprest .</l>
     <l n="38">Yet in the meantime wilt small winds bestow ,</l>
     <l n="39">That from thy fan , moved by my hand , may blow ?</l>
     <l n="40">Or is my heat of mind , not of the sky ?</l>
     <l n="41">Is't women 's love my captive breast doth fry ? 40</l>
     <l n="42">While thus I speak , black dust her white robes ray ;<span type="note_anchor">[ 354 ]</span></l>
     <l n="43">Foul dust , from her fair body go away !</l>
     <l n="44">Now comes the pomp ; themselves let all men cheer ;<span type="note_anchor">[ 355 ]</span></l>
     <l n="45">The shout is nigh ; the golden pomp comes here .</l>
     <l n="46">First , Victory is brought with large spread wing :</l>
     <l n="47">Goddess , come here ; make my love conquering .</l>
     <l n="48">Applaud you Neptune , that dare trust his wave ,</l>
     <l n="49">The sea I use not : me my earth must have .</l>
     <l n="50">Soldier applaud thy Mars , no wars we move ,</l>
     <l n="51">Peace pleaseth me , and in mid peace is love . 50</l>
     <l n="52">With augurs Phoebus , Phoebe with hunters stands .</l>
     <l n="53">To thee Minerva turn the craftsmen 's hands .</l>
     <l n="54">Ceres and Bacchus countrymen adore ,</l>
     <l n="55">Champions please<span type="note_anchor">[ 356 ]</span>Pollux , Castor loves horsemen more .</l>
     <l n="56">Thee , gentle Venus , and the boy that flies ,</l>
     <l n="57">We praise : great goddess aid my enterprise .</l>
     <l n="58">Let my new mistress grant to be beloved ;</l>
     <l n="59">She becked , and prosperous signs gave as she moved .</l>
     <l n="60">What Venus promised , promise thou we pray</l>
     <l n="61">Greater than her , by her leave , thou'rt , I 'll say . 60</l>
     <l n="62">The gods , and their rich pomp witness with me ,</l>
     <l n="63">For evermore thou shalt my mistress be .</l>
     <l n="64">Thy legs hang down , thou may'st , if that be best ,</l>
     <l n="65">Awhile<span type="note_anchor">[ 357 ]</span>thy tiptoes on the footstool<span type="note_anchor">[ 358 ]</span>rest .</l>

     <l n="70">Alas , he runs too far about the ring ;</l>
     <l n="71">What dost ? thy waggon in less compass bring . 70</l>
     <l n="72">What dost , unhappy ? her good wishes fade :</l>
     <l n="73">Let with strong hand the rein to bend be made .</l>
     <l n="74">One slow we favour , Romans , him revoke :</l>
     <l n="75">And each give signs by casting up his cloak .</l>
     <l n="76">They call him back ; lest their gowns toss thy hair ,</l>
     <l n="77">To hide thee in my bosom straight repair .</l>
     <l n="78">But now again the barriers open lie ,</l>
     <l n="79">And forth the gay troops on swift horses fly .</l>
     <l n="80">At least now conquer , and outrun the rest :</l>
     <l n="81">My mistress ’ wish confirm with my request . 80</l>
     <l n="82">My mistress hath her wish ; my wish remain :</l>
     <l n="83">He holds the palm : my palm is yet to gain .</l>

     <l n="4">How long her locks were ere her oath she took ,</l>
     <l n="5">So long they be since she her faith forsook .</l>
     <l n="6">Fair white with rose-red was before commixt ;</l>
     <l n="7">Now shine her looks pure white and red betwixt .</l>
     <l n="8">Her foot was small : her foot 's form is most fit :</l>
     <l n="9">Comely tall was she , comely tall she 's yet .</l>
     <l n="10">Sharp eyes she had : radiant like stars they be ,</l>
     <l n="11">By which she , perjured oft , hath lied to<span type="note_anchor">[ 362 ]</span>me . 10</l>
     <l n="12">In sooth , th ’ eternal powers grant maids society</l>

     <l n="8">She on my neck her ivory arms did throw ,</l>
     <l n="9">Her<span type="note_anchor">[ 381 ]</span>arms far whiter than the Scythian snow .</l>
     <l n="10">And eagerly she kissed me with her tongue ,</l>

    <head>OF A GULL . II .</head>
     <l n="1">Oft in my laughing rhymes I name a gull ;</l>
     <l n="2">But this new term will many questions breed ;</l>
     <l n="3">Therefore at first I will express at full ,</l>
     <l n="4">Who is a true and perfect gull indeed .</l>
     <l n="5">A gull is he who fears a velvet gown ,</l>
     <l n="6">And , when a wench is brave , dares not speak to her ;</l>
     <l n="7">A gull is he which traverseth the town ,</l>
     <l n="8">And is for marriage known a common wooer ;</l>
     <l n="9">A gull is he which , while he proudly wears</l>
     <l n="10">A silver-hilted rapier by his side , 10</l>
     <l n="11">Endures the lie<span type="note_anchor">[ 461 ]</span>and knocks about the ears ,</l>
     <l n="12">Whilst in his sheath his sleeping sword doth bide ;</l>
     <l n="13">A gull is he which wears good handsome clothes ,</l>
     <l n="14">And stands in presence stroking up his hair ,</l>
     <l n="15">And fills up his unperfect speech with oaths ,</l>
     <l n="16">But speaks not one wise word throughout the year :</l>
     <l n="17">But , to define a gull in terms precise ,—</l>
     <l n="18">A gull is he which seems and is not wise .<span type="note_anchor">[ 462 ]</span></l>

   <p>‘ TO CANDIDUS . Friend Candidus , thou often doost demaund What humours men by gulling understand . Our English Martiall hath full pleasantly In his close nips describde a gull to thee : I'le follow him , and set downe my conceit What a gull is — oh , word of much receit ! He is a gull whose indiscretion Cracks his purse-strings to be in fashion ; He is a gull who is long in taking roote In barraine soyle where can be but small fruite ; He is a gull who runnes himselfe in debt For twelue dayes ’ wonder , hoping so to get ; He is a gull whose conscience is a block , Not to take interest , but wastes his stock ; He is a gull who cannot haue a whore , But brags how much he spends upon her score ; He is a gull that for commoditie Payes tenne times ten , and sells the same for three ; He is a gull who , passing finicall , Peiseth each word to be rhetoricall ; And , to conclude , who selfe-conceitedly Thinks al men guls , ther 's none more gull then he . ’</p>

   <p>FOOTNOTES :</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 463 ]</span>It was a common practice for gallants to sit upon hired stools in the stage , especially at the private theatres . From the Induction to Marston 's Malcontent it appears that the custom was not tolerated at some of the public theatres . The ordinary charge for the use of a stool was sixpence .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 464 ]</span>Malone was no doubt right in supposing that there is here an allusion to the “ private boxes ” placed at each side of the balcony at the back of the stage . They must have been very dark and uncomfortable . In the Gull 's Horn-Book Dekker says that “ much new Satin was there dampned by being smothered to death in darkness . ”</p>

    <head>TO HIS KIND AND TRUE FRIEND , EDWARD BLUNT .<span type="note_anchor">[ 576 ]</span></head>
    <head>Blunt ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 577 ]</span>I propose to be blunt with you , and , out of my dulness , to encounter you with a Dedication in memory of that pure elemental wit , Chr . Marlowe , whose ghost or genius is to be seen walk the Churchyard ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 578 ]</span>in , at the least , three or four sheets . Methinks you should presently look wild now , and grow humorously frantic upon the taste of it . Well , lest you should , let me tell you , this spirit was sometime a familiar of your own , Lucan 's First Book translated ; which , in regard of your old right in it , I have raised in the circle of your patronage . But stay now , Edward : if I mistake not , you are to accommodate yourself with some few instructions , touching the property of a patron , that you are not yet possessed of ; and to study them for your better grace , as our gallants do fashions . First , you must be proud , and think you have merit enough in you , though you are ne'er so empty ; then , when I bring you the book , take physic , and keep state ; assign me a time by your man to come again ; and , afore the day , be sure to have changed your lodging ; in the meantime sleep little , and sweat with the invention of some pitiful dry jest or two , which you may happen to utter with some little , or not at all , marking of your friends , when you have found a place for them to come in at ; or , if by chance something has dropped from you worth the taking up , weary all that come to you with the often repetition of it ; censure , scornfully enough , and somewhat like a traveller ; commend nothing , lest you discredit your ( that which you would seem to have ) judgment . These things , if you can mould yourself to them , Ned , I make no question that they will not become you . One special virtue in our patrons of these days I have promised myself you shall fit excellently , which is , to give nothing ; yes , thy love I will challenge as my peculiar object , both in this , and , I hope , many more succeeding offices . Farewell : I affect not the world should measure my thoughts to thee by a scale of this nature : leave to think good of me when I fall from thee .</head>

     <l n="144">Yet he alone is held in reverence .</l>
     <l n="145">Cæsar 's renown for war was loss ; he restless ,</l>

     <l n="148">At all times charging home , and making havoc ;</l>
     <l n="149">Urging his fortune , trusting in the gods ,</l>
     <l n="150">Destroying what withstood his proud desires , 150</l>

     <l n="159">Such humours stirr 'd them up ; but this war 's seed</l>
     <l n="160">Was even the same that wrecks all great dominions . 160</l>
     <l n="161">When Fortune made us lords of all , wealth flow 'd ,</l>
     <l n="162">And then we grew licentious and rude ;</l>
     <l n="163">The soldiers ’ prey and rapine brought in riot ;</l>
     <l n="164">Men took delight in jewels , houses , plate ,</l>
     <l n="165">And scorn 'd old sparing diet , and ware robes</l>

     <l n="169">And then large limits had their butting lands ;</l>
     <l n="170">The ground , which Curius and Camillus till 'd , 170</l>
     <l n="171">Was stretched unto the fields of hinds unknown .</l>
     <l n="172">Again , this people could not brook calm peace ;</l>
     <l n="173">Them freedom without war might not suffice :</l>
     <l n="174">Quarrels were rife ; greedy desire , still poor ,</l>
     <l n="175">Did vild deeds ; then ‘ twas worth the price of blood ,</l>
     <l n="176">And deem 'd renown , to spoil their native town ;</l>
     <l n="177">Force mastered right , the strongest govern 'd all ;</l>
     <l n="178">Hence came it that th ’ edicts were over-rul 'd ,</l>
     <l n="179">That laws were broke , tribunes with consuls strove ,</l>
     <l n="180">Sale made of offices , and people 's voices 180</l>
     <l n="181">Bought by themselves and sold , and every year</l>
     <l n="182">Frauds and corruption in the Field of Mars ;</l>
     <l n="183">Hence interest and devouring usury sprang ,</l>
     <l n="184">Faith 's breach , and hence came war , to most men welcome .</l>
     <l n="185">Now Cæsar overpass 'd the snowy Alps ;</l>
     <l n="186">His mind was troubled , and he aim 'd at war :</l>
     <l n="187">And coming to the ford of Rubicon ,</l>
     <l n="188">At night in dreadful vision fearful<span type="note_anchor">[ 594 ]</span>Rome</l>

     <l n="191">And arms all naked ; who , with broken sighs ,</l>
     <l n="192">And staring , thus bespoke : “ What mean'st thou , Cæsar ?</l>
     <l n="193">Whither goes my standard ? Romans if ye be ,</l>
     <l n="194">And bear true hearts , stay here ! ” This spectacle</l>
     <l n="195">Struck Cæsar 's heart with fear ; his hair stood up ,</l>
     <l n="196">And faintness numb 'd his steps there on the brink .</l>
     <l n="197">He thus cried out : “ Thou thunderer that guard'st</l>

     <l n="206">This said , he , laying aside all lets<span type="note_anchor">[ 595 ]</span>of war ,</l>
     <l n="207">Approach 'd the swelling stream with drum and ensign :</l>
     <l n="208">Like to a lion of scorch 'd desert Afric ,</l>
     <l n="209">Who , seeing hunters , pauseth till fell wrath</l>

     <l n="211">His tail athwart his back , and crest heav 'd up ,</l>
     <l n="212">With jaws wide-open ghastly roaring out ,</l>
     <l n="213">Albeit the Moor 's light javelin or his spear</l>
     <l n="214">Sticks in his side , yet runs upon the hunter .</l>
     <l n="215">In summer-time the purple Rubicon ,</l>
     <l n="216">Which issues from a small spring , is but shallow ,</l>
     <l n="217">And creeps along the vales , dividing just</l>
     <l n="218">The bounds of Italy from Cisalpine France .</l>
     <l n="219">But now the winter 's wrath , and watery moon</l>
     <l n="220">Being three days old , enforc 'd the flood to swell , 220</l>
     <l n="221">And frozen Alps thaw 'd with resolving winds .</l>
     <l n="222">The thunder-hoof 'd<span type="note_anchor">[ 596 ]</span>horse , in a crookèd line ,</l>
     <l n="223">To scape the violence of the stream , first waded ;</l>
     <l n="224">Which being broke , the foot had easy passage .</l>
     <l n="225">As soon as Cæsar got unto the bank</l>

     <l n="230">This said , the restless general through the dark , 230</l>
     <l n="231">Swifter than bullets thrown from Spanish slings ,</l>
     <l n="232">Or darts which Parthians backward shoot , march 'd on ;</l>

     <l n="236">Whether the gods or blustering south were cause</l>
     <l n="237">I know not , but the cloudy air did frown .</l>
     <l n="238">The soldiers having won the market-place ,</l>
     <l n="239">There spread the colours with confusèd noise</l>
     <l n="240">Of trumpets ’ clang , shrill cornets , whistling fifes . 240</l>
     <l n="241">The people started ; young men left their beds ,</l>
     <l n="242">And snatch 'd arms near their household-gods hung up ,</l>
     <l n="243">Such as peace yields ; worm-eaten leathern targets ,</l>
     <l n="244">Through which the wood peer 'd ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 597 ]</span>headless darts , old swords</l>
     <l n="245">With ugly teeth of black rust foully scarr 'd .</l>
     <l n="246">But seeing white eagles , and Rome 's flags well known ,</l>
     <l n="247">And lofty Cæsar in the thickest throng ,</l>
     <l n="248">They shook for fear , and cold benumb 'd their limbs ,</l>
     <l n="249">And muttering much , thus to themselves complain 'd :</l>
     <l n="250">“ O walls unfortunate , too near to France ! 250</l>

     <l n="259">Thus sighing whisper 'd they , and none durst speak ,</l>

     <l n="261">When birds are silent thorough winter 's rage ,</l>
     <l n="262">Or sea far from the land , so all were whist ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 598 ]</span></l>
     <l n="263">Now light had quite dissolv 'd the misty night ,</l>
     <l n="264">And Cæsar 's mind unsettled musing stood ;</l>
     <l n="265">But gods and fortune pricked him to this war ,</l>
     <l n="266">Infringing all excuse of modest shame ,</l>

     <l n="268">The angry senate , urging Gracchus '[ 600 ] deeds ,</l>
     <l n="269">From doubtful Rome wrongly expell 'd the tribunes</l>

     <l n="271">And with them Curio , sometime tribune too ,</l>
     <l n="272">One that was fee 'd for Cæsar , and whose tongue</l>
     <l n="273">Could tune the people to the nobles ’ mind .<span type="note_anchor">[ 601 ]</span></l>
     <l n="274">“ Cæsar , ” said he , “ while eloquence prevail 'd ,</l>

     <l n="286">May bring her down , and with her all the world .</l>
     <l n="287">Nor shalt thou triumph when thou com'st to Rome ,</l>

     <l n="293">And therewith Cæsar , prone enough to war ,</l>
     <l n="294">Was so incens 'd as are Elean<span type="note_anchor">[ 604 ]</span>steeds .</l>

     <l n="354">Th ’ unstable people made : their household-gods</l>
     <l n="355">And love to Rome ( though slaughter steel 'd their hearts ,</l>

     <l n="481">Thus in his fright did each man strengthen fame ,</l>

     <l n="511">The world , were it together , is by cowards</l>

     <l n="515">And sudden rampire rais 'd of turf snatched up ,</l>

     <l n="517">Thou , Rome , at name of war runn'st from thyself ,</l>
     <l n="518">And wilt not trust thy city-walls one night :</l>
     <l n="519">Well might these fear , when Pompey feared and fled .</l>
     <l n="520">Now evermore , lest some one hope might ease 520</l>
     <l n="521">The commons ’ jangling minds , apparent signs arose ,</l>

     <l n="524">Great store of strange and unknown stars were seen</l>
     <l n="525">Wandering about the north , and rings of fire</l>
     <l n="526">Fly in the air , and dreadful bearded stars ,</l>
     <l n="527">And comets that presage the fall of kingdoms ;</l>
     <l n="528">The flattering<span type="note_anchor">[ 634 ]</span>sky glittered in often flames ,</l>
     <l n="529">And sundry fiery meteors blazed in heaven ,</l>
     <l n="530">Now spear-like long , now like a spreading torch ; 530</l>
     <l n="531">Lightning in silence stole forth without clouds ,</l>
     <l n="532">And , from the northern climate snatching fire ,</l>
     <l n="533">Blasted the Capitol ; the lesser stars ,</l>
     <l n="534">Which wont to run their course through empty night ,</l>
     <l n="535">At noon-day mustered ; Phoebe , having filled</l>

     <l n="539">His burning chariot plunged in sable clouds ,</l>
     <l n="540">And whelmed the world in darkness , making men 540</l>

     <l n="546">Coal-black Charybdis whirled a sea of blood .</l>
     <l n="547">Fierce mastives howled . The vestal fires went out ;</l>

     <l n="550">Rose , like the Theban brothers ’ funeral fire . 550</l>
     <l n="551">The earth went off her hinges ; and the Alps</l>

     <l n="565">Curling their bloody locks , howl dreadful things .</l>
     <l n="566">Souls quiet and appeas 'd sighed from their graves ;</l>
     <l n="567">Clashing of arms was heard ; in untrod woods</l>
     <l n="568">Shrill voices schright ;<span type="note_anchor">[ 638 ]</span>and ghosts encounter men .</l>
     <l n="569">Those that inhabited the suburb-fields</l>

     <l n="571">Shaking her snaky hair and crookèd pine</l>
     <l n="572">With flaming top ; much like that hellish fiend</l>

     <l n="591">Then , that the trembling citizens should walk</l>
     <l n="592">About the city ; then , the sacred priests</l>
     <l n="593">That with divine lustration purg 'd the walls ,</l>

     <l n="599">Sibylla 's secret works , and wash<span type="note_anchor">[ 642 ]</span>their saint</l>
     <l n="600">In Almo 's flood ; next learnèd augurs follow ; 600</l>
     <l n="601">Apollo 's soothsayers , and Jove 's feasting priests ;</l>
     <l n="602">The skipping Salii with shields like wedges ;</l>

     <l n="604">While these thus in and out had circled Rome ,</l>
     <l n="605">Look , what the lightning blasted , Arruns takes ,</l>
     <l n="606">And it inters with murmurs dolorous ,</l>
     <l n="607">And calls the place Bidental . On the altar</l>
     <l n="608">He lays a ne'erhYpppHeNyok ' d bull , and pours down wine ,</l>
     <l n="609">Then crams salt leaven on his crookèd knife :</l>
     <l n="610">The beast long struggled , as being like to prove 610</l>
     <l n="611">An awkward sacrifice ; but by the horns</l>
     <l n="612">The quick priest pulled him on his knees , and slew him .</l>
     <l n="613">No vein sprung out , but from the yawning gash ,</l>
     <l n="614">Instead of red blood , wallow 'd venomous gore .</l>
     <l n="615">These direful signs made Arruns stand amazed ,</l>
     <l n="616">And searching farther for the gods ’ displeasure ,</l>
     <l n="617">The very colour scared him ; a dead blackness</l>
     <l n="618">Ran through the blood , that turned it all to jelly ,</l>
     <l n="619">And stained the bowels with dark loathsome spots ;</l>
     <l n="620">The liver swelled with filth ; and every vein 620</l>
     <l n="621">Did threaten horror from the host of Cæsar</l>
     <l n="622">A small thin skin contained the vital parts ;</l>

    <head><span type="note_anchor">[ 670 ]</span>First printed in The Alleyn Papers ( for the Shakespeare Society ) , p. 8 , by Collier , who remarks :— “ In the original MS. this dramatic dialogue in verse is written as prose , on one side of a sheet of paper , at the back of which , in a more modern hand , is the name ‘ Kitt Marlowe . ’ What connection , if any , he may have had with it , it is impossible to determine , but it was obviously worthy of preservation , as a curious stage-relic of an early date , and unlike anything else of the kind that has come down to us . In consequence of haste or ignorance on the part of the writer of the manuscript , it has been necessary to supply some portions , which are printed within brackets . There are also some obvious errors in the distribution of the dialogue , which it was not easy to correct . The probability is that , when performed , it was accompanied with music . ”</head>

   <note>Now-a-days inquiries as to the age of the earth are of interest only to Geologists ; and all may criticise with impunity the career of Moses — provided that they do not employ the shafts of ridicule too freely . Marlowe 's strictures on the New Testament — grossly exaggerated by the creature who penned the charges — were made from the literary point of view . We should blame nobody to-day for saying that the language of Revelations is poor and thin when compared with the language of Isaiah . Again , as to the statement that Romanism alone is logical , and that Protestantism has no locus standi ,— has not the doctrine been proclaimed again and again in our own day by writers whom we all respect ? The charge that Marlowe had announced his intention of coining French crowns is so utterly absurd as to throw discredit upon all the other statements . It must be remembered that the testimony was not upon oath , and that the deponent was a ruffian .</note>

   <p>An edition of Marlowe cannot be more fitly concluded than by a reprint of Mr. R. H. Horne 's noble and pathetic tragedy , The Death of Marlowe ( originally published in 1837 ) , one of the few dramatic pieces of the present century that will have any interest for posterity . For permission to reprint this tragedy I am indebted to Mr. Horne 's literary executor , Mr. H. Buxton Forman .</p>

   <p>How so ? He knoweth her for what she is , as well as for what she was ;— the high-spirited and once virtuous wife of the drunkard Bengough . You remember him ?</p>
   <p>HEYWOOD .</p>
   <p>I have seen him i ’ the mire . ‘ Twas his accustomed bed o ’ nights — and morning , too — many a time . He preferred that to the angel he left at home . Some men do . ‘ Tis a sorrow to think upon .</p>
   <p>MIDDLETON .</p>
   <p>And one that tears cannot wash ! Master Marlowe hath too deep a reading i ’ the books of nature to nail his heart upon a gilded weathercock . He is only desperate after the fashion of a pearl diver . When he hath enough he will desist — breathe freely , polish the shells , and build grottoes .</p>
   <p>HEYWOOD .</p>
   <p>Nay , he persisteth in not knowing her for a courtesan — talks of her purity in burning words , that seem to glow and enhance his love from his convictions of her virtue ; then suddenly falls into silent abstraction , looking like a man whose eyes are filled with visions of Paradise . No pains takes she to deceive him ; for he supersedes the chance by deceiving himself beyond measure . He either listens not at all to intimation , or insists the contrary .</p>
