     <l n="5">Our AVTHOR , to the Graver did commend</l>

     <l n="11">The first intended FRONTISPIECE , is lost .</l>
     <l n="12">The AVTHOR , was as much displeas ’ d , as Hee</l>
     <l n="13">In such Adventures , is inclin ’ d to bee ;</l>
     <l n="14">And , halfe resolv ’ d , to cast this PIECE aside ,</l>

     <l n="17">Blame-worthy ( at the first aspect ) appeare ;</l>
     <l n="18">Hee saw , they fitted many Fantasies</l>
     <l n="19">Much better , then what Reason can devise ;</l>
     <l n="20">And , that , the Graver ( by meere Chance ) had hit</l>
     <l n="21">On what , so much transcends the reach of Wit ,</l>
     <l n="22">As made it seeme , an Object of Delight ,</l>
     <l n="23">To looke on what , MISFORTVNE brought to light :</l>

     <l n="44">YOV , double-treble-foure-fold Emblems are ;</l>

     <l n="83">My Lines , ( which from that staine have , yet , beene cleare )</l>
     <l n="84">Would Flatt ’ ry seeme , unto an envious eare .</l>

     <l n="87">Or , what needs he to feare a sland ’ rous-mouth ,</l>

     <l n="89">Your Princely Vertues , what can better show ,</l>

     <l n="93">Your Civill Actions ( to the publike eye )</l>
     <l n="94">Are faire examples of Moralitie ,</l>
     <l n="95">So manifest ; That , if he Truth did sing ,</l>

     <l n="112">That , we , for Blessings , oft , Vnthankefull be .</l>
     <l n="113">For , as you , Both , Prime Children are of those</l>
     <l n="114">Two Sister-Churches , betwixt whom , yet , growes</l>
     <l n="115">Vnseemely strife ; So , You , perhaps , may be</l>
     <l n="116">An Emblem , how those MOTHERS may agree .</l>
     <l n="117">And , not by your Example , onely , show ,</l>

   <p>If there had not beene some = Bookes = conceitedly composed , and sutable to meane capacities , I am doubtfull , whether I had ever beene so delighted in reading , as thereby to attaine to the little Knowledge I have : For , I doe yet remember , that , things = honestly pleasant =, brought mee by degrees , to love that which is = truely profitable =. And as = David = said , His = Heart shewed him the wickednesse of the Vngodly =; ( meaning perhaps , that hee felt in himselfe , some = Experiments =, of the same naturall Corruption , by which they are overcome , who resist not evill suggestions at their first motions :) Even so , I may truly acknowledge , that mine owne = Experience = hath showne mee so much of the common = Ignorance = and = Infirmitie = in mine owne person , that it hath taught mee , how those things may be wrought upon in others , to their best advantage .</p>
   <p>Therefore , though I can say no more to disswade from = Vice =, or to incourage men to = Vertue =, than hath already beene said in many learned = Authors =; yet I may be an occasion by these = Endeavours =, to bring that , the oftner into remembrance , which they have , more learnedly , expressed ; and perhaps , by such circumstances , as they would not descend unto , may insinuate further also with some Capacities , than more applauded = Meanes =. = Viniger =, = Salt =, or common = Water =, ( which are very meane = Ingredients =) make Sawces more pleasing to some tastes , than = Sugar =, and = Spices =. In like manner , plaine and vulgar notions , seasoned with a little = Pleasantnesse =, and relished with a moderate = Sharpnesse =, worke that , otherwhile , which the most admired = Compositions = could never effect in many = Readers =; yea , wee have had frequent proofes , that a blunt = Iest = hath moved to more consideration , than a judicious = Discourse =.</p>
   <p>I take little pleasures in = Rymes =, = Fictions =, or conceited = Compositions =, for their owne sakes ; neither could I ever take so much paines , as to spend time to put my meanings into other words than such as flowed forth , without = Studie =; partly because I delight more in Matter , than in = Wordy Flourishes =, But , chiefely , because those = Verball Conceites =, which by some , are accounted most = Elegant =, are not onely ( for the greater part ) = Emptie Sounds = and Impertinent = Clinches =, in themselves ; but , such = Inventions =, as do sometime , also , obscure the = Sense =, to common = Readers =; and , serve to little other purpose , but for = Wittie men = to shew = Tricks = one to another : For , the = Ignorant = understand them not ; and the = Wise = need them not .</p>
   <p>So much of them , as ( without darkning the matter , to them who most need instruction ) may be made use of , to stirre up the = Affections =, winne = Attention =, or help the = Memory =, I approve and make use of , to those good purposes , according as my leisure , and the measure of my = Facultie = will permit ; that , = Vanitie = might not , to worse ends , get them wholly into her = Possession =. For , I know that the meanest of such conceites are as pertinent to some , as = Rattles =, and = Hobby-horses = to Children ; or as the = A . B. C .= and = Spelling =, were at first to those = Readers =, who are now past them . And , indeed , to despise = Meane Inventions =, = Pleasant Compositions =, and = Verball Elegancies =, ( being qualified as is aforesaid ) or to banish them out of the world , because there be other things of more excellencie , were as absurd , as to neglect and root out all = Herbes =, which will not make = Pottage =; Or , to destroy all = Flowers =, which are lesse beautifull than the = Tulip =, or lesse sweet than the = Rose =.</p>
   <p>I ( that was never so sullenly wise ) have alwaies intermingled = Sports = with = Seriousnesse = in my = Inventions =; and , taken in = Verball-conceites =, as they came to hand , without = Affectation =; But , having , ever aymed , rather to profit my = Readers =, than to gaine their praise , I never pumpe for those things ; and am , otherwhile , contented to seeme = Foolish =, ( yea , and perhaps , more foolish than I am ) to the = Overweening-Wise =; that , I may make others = Wiser than they were =: And , ( as I now doe ) am not ashamed to set forth a = Game at Lots =, or ( as it were ) a = Puppet-play = in = Pictures =, to allure men to the more serious observation of the profitable = Morals =, couched in these = Emblems =. Neverthelesse , ( if some have sayd , and thought truly ) my = Poems = have instructed , and rectified many People in the Course of = Honest-living =, ( which is the best = Wisedome =) much more than the = Austerer Volumes = of some criticall = Authors =; who , are by the = Common-sort =, therefore onely , judged Wise , because they composed = Books =, which few understand , save they who need them not .</p>
   <p>In these = Lots = and = Emblems =, I have the same ayme which I had in my other = Writings =: and , though I have not dressed them sutably to curious = Fancies =, yet , they yield wholsome nourishment to strengthen the constitution of a = Good-life =; and , have solidity enough for a = Play game =, which was but Accidentally composed ; and , by this = Occasion =.</p>
   <p>These = Emblems =, graven in Copper by = Crispinus Passæus = ( with a = Motto = in Greeke , Latine , or Italian , round about every = Figure =; and with two = Lines = ( or = Verses =) in one of the same = Languages =, periphrasing those = Motto ’ s =) came to my hands , almost twentie yeares past . The = Verses = were so meane , that , they were afterward cut off from the = Plates =; And , the = Collector = of the said Emblems , ( whether hee were the = Versifier = or the = Graver =, was neither so well advised in the = Choice = of them , nor so exact in observing the true = Proprieties = belonging to every = Figure =, as hee might have beene .</p>
   <p>Yet , the = Workman-ship = being judged very good , for the most part ; and the rest excusable ; some of my Friends were so much delighted in the = Gravers = art , and , in those = Illustrations =, which for mine owne pleasure , I had made upon some few of them , that , they requested mee to = Moralize = the rest . Which I condiscended unto : And , they had beene brought to view many yeares agoe , but that the = Copper Prints = ( which are now gotten ) could not be procured out of = Holland =, upon any reasonable Conditions .</p>
   <p>If they were worthy of the = Gravers = and = Printers = cost , being onely dumbe = Figures =, little usefull to any but to young = Gravers = or = Painters =, and as little delightfull , except , to = Children =, and = Childish-gazers =: they may now be much more worthy ; seeing the life of = Speach = being added unto them , may make them = Teachers = and = Remembrancers = of profitable things .</p>
   <p>I doe not arrogate so much unto my = Illustrations =, as to thinke , they will be able to teach any thing to the = Learned =; yet if they cast their eyes upon them , perhaps , these = Emblems =, and their = Morals =, may remember them , either of some = Dutie =, which they might else forget , or minde them to beware of some = Danger =, which they might otherwise be unheedfull to prevent . But , sure I am , the = Vulgar Capacities =, may from them , be many waies both = Instructed =, and = Remembred =; yea , they that have most need to be = Instructed =, and = Remembred =, ( and they who are most backward to listen to = Instructions =, and = Remembrances =, by the common Course of = Teaching =, and = Admonishing =) shall be , hereby , informed of their = Dangers =, or = Duties =, by the way of an honest = Recreation =, before they be aware .</p>
   <p>For , when levitie , or a childish delight in trifling Objects , hath allured them to looke on the = Pictures =; Curiositie may urge them to peepe further , that they might seeke out also their = Meanings =, in our annexed = Illustrations =; In which , may lurke some = Sentence =, or = Expression =, so evidently pertinent to their = Estates =, = Persons =, or = Affections =, as will ( at that instant or afterward ) make way for those = Considerations =, which will , at last , wholly change them , or much better them , in their = Conversation =.</p>
   <p>To seeke out the = Author = of every particular = Emblem =, were a labour without profit ; and , I have beene so far from endeavouring it , that , I have not so much as cared to find out their meanings in any of these = Figures =; but , applied them , rather , to such purposes , as I could thinke of , at first sight ; which , upon a second view , I found might have beene much betterd , if I could have spared time from other imployments . Something , also , I was = Confined =, by obliging my selfe to observe the same number of = lines = in every = Illustration =; and , otherwhile , I was thereby constrained to conclude , when my best = Meditations = were but new begunne : which ( though it hath pleased Some , by the more comely Vniformitie , in the Pages ) yet , it hath much injured the libertie of my = Muse =.</p>
   <p>There be , no doubt , some faults committed by the = Printer =, both Literall and Materiall , and some Errors of the = Gravers = in the = Figures =, ( as in the = Tetragrammaton =; in the Figure of = Arîon =; and in the = Proprieties = due to some other = Hieroglyphicks =; but , for the most part , they are such , as = Common-Readers = will never perceive ; and I thinke , that they who are = Judicious = will so plainly finde them to be no faults of mine ; that , leaving them to be amended by those , to whom they appertaine ; and , = You =, to accept of these = Play-games = as you please : I bid you = Farewell =.</p>
   <p>The Occasion , Intention , and use of the Foure Lotteries adjoyned to these foure Books of Emblems .</p>
   <p>Stultorum plena sunt omnia . The world is growne so in Love with = Follie =, that the Imprinting of over-solid and serious = treatises = would undoe the Book-sellers ; especially , being so chargeable as the many costly = Sculptures = have made this Booke : therefore , ( to advance their = Profits =, rather than to satisfie my owne = Iudgement =) I was moved to invent somewhat , which might be likely to please the vulgar Capacitie , without hindrance to my chiefe = End =. And , though that which I resolved on , be not so = Plausible = to Criticall understandings , yet I am contented to hazzard among them , so much of my Reputation as that comes to .</p>
   <p>I have often observed , that where the = Summer-bowers = of Recreation are placed neare the = Church =, it drawes thither more people from the remote = Hamlets =, than would else be there . Now , though I praise not their = Devotion =, yet I am glad if any thing ( which is not evill in it selfe ) may be made an occasion of = Good =: ( because , those things may , perhaps , be continued , at last , for Conscience sake , which were at first begunne upon vaine = occasions =) and , have therefore added = Lotteries = to these = Emblems =, to occasion the more frequent notice of the = Morals =, and good = Counsels = tendred in their = Illustrations =; hoping that , at one time or other , some shall draw those = Lots =, which will make them the better , and the happier , whilest they live . I confesse that this Devise may probably be censured , as unsutable to the gravitie expected in my ripe yeares : and be reputed as great an Indecorum , as erecting an = Ale-house = at the = Church-stile =; yet , the same having had beginning in my younger dayes , I do now resolve not to be ashamed of it , for the Reasons aforementioned . To such as I was , it will be someway avayleable : and perhaps , if the = Wisest = did otherwhile , when they walke abroad , to = Vncertaine purposes =, take up this = Booke =, and ( without = Superstitious Conceites =) make tryall what their = Lots = would remember , or give them cause to thinke on ; it might , now and then , either occasion better = Proceedings =, or prevent = Mischieves =.</p>
   <p>Some = Games = were ever in use ; ever , I thinke , will be , and for ought I know , ever may be without exception . And , I believe , this = Recreation =, will be as harmlesse as any , if it be used according to my Intentions . For , my meaning is not , that any should use it as an = Oracle =, which could signifie , infallibly , what is divinely alloted ; but , to serve onely for a = Morall Pastime =. And , that I may no way encourage the secret entertaining of such a = Fantasie =, I doe before hand affirme unto them , that none but = Children =, or = Ideots = may be tollerated to be so foolish , without laughing at .</p>
   <p>Yet , if any one shall draw that = Lot = wherein his = Secret vices = are reproved ; or some good Counsels proposed , which in his owne understanding are pertinent to his welfare , let not such as = those =, passe them over as meere = Casualties = to them ; for , whatsoever these = Lots = are to = others =, or in = themselves =, they are to all = these =, made pertinent in such cases , both by their particular = Knowledges = and = Occasions =.</p>
   <p>Some will thinke perhaps , that I have purposely invented this = Game =, that I might finde meanes to reprove mens = vices =, without being suspected , ( as I have hitherto unjustly beene ) to ayme at particular persons : For , if any who are = notoriously Guiltie =, shall by drawing their = Chances =, among other Companions , be so fitted with = Lots =, ( which may now and then happen ) that those = Vices = be therby intimated to the by-standers , of which the world knowes them guilty ; they do therin make their owne = Libels =; and , may ( I hope ) bee laughed at without my blame . If not ; I doe here warne all such as are worthily suspected of = Haynous crimes =, and = Scandalous conversations =, either to forbeare these = Lotteries =; or to excuse me if they be justly shamed by their own = Act =.</p>
   <p>Having thus declared the Reason of this = Invention =, and made these Anticipations ; every man hath his choice , whether hee will make use of those = Lotteries = or no ; hee that will , is left to his = Chance =, of which , how hee shall make tryall , direction is given in the two last Pages of this = Booke =.</p>

[ Illustration : Decoration ] A Supersedeas to all them , whose custome it is , without any deserving , to importune Authors to give unto them their Bookes . It merits nor your Anger , nor my Blame , That , thus I have inscrib ’ d this Epigram : For , they who know me , know , that , Bookes thus large , And , fraught with Emblems , do augment the Charge Too much above my Fortunes , to afford A Gift so costly , for an Aierie-word : And , I have prov ’ d , your Begging-Qualitie , So forward , to oppresse my Modestie ; That , for my future ease , it seemeth fit , To take some Order , for preventing it . And , peradventure , other Authors may , Find Cause to thanke me for ’ t , another day . These many years , it hath your Custom bin , That , when in my possession , you have seene A Volume , of mine owne , you did no more , But , Aske and Take ; As if you thought my store Encreast , without my Cost ; And , that , by Giving , ( Both Paines and Charges too ) I got my living ; Or , that , I find the Paper and the Printing , As easie to me , as the Bookes Inventing . If , of my Studies , no esteeme you have , You , then abuse the Courtesies you crave ; And , are Vnthankfull . If you prize them ought , Why should my Labour , not enough be thought , Vnlesse , I adde Expenses to my paines ? The Stationer , affoords for little Gaines , The Bookes you crave : And , He , as well as I Might give away , what you repine to buy : For , what hee Gives , doth onely Mony Cost , In mine , both Mony , Time , and Wit is lost . What I shall Give , and what I have bestow ’ d On Friends , to whom , I Love , or Service ow ’ d , I grudge not ; And , I thinke it is from them , Sufficient , that such Gifts they do esteeme : Yea , and , it is a Favour too , when they Will take these Triflles , my large Dues to pay ; ( Or , Aske them at my hands , when I forget , That , I am to their Love , so much in debt . ) But , this inferres not , that , I should bestow The like on all men , who , my Name do know ; Or , have the Face to aske : For , then , I might , Of Wit and Mony , soone be begger ’ d , quite . So much , already , hath beene Beg ’ d away , ( For which , I neither had , nor looke for pay ) As being valu ’ d at the common Rate , Had rais ’ d , Five hundred Crownes , in my Estate . Which , ( if I may confesse it ) signifies , That , I was farre more Liberall , than Wise . But , for the time to come , resolv ’ d I am , That , till without denyall ( or just blame ) I may of those , who Cloth and Clothes do make , ( As oft as I shall need them ) Aske , and Take ; You shall no more befoole me . Therfore , Pray Be Answer ’ d ; And , henceforward , keepe away . [ Illustration : Decoration ] A Direction , shewing how they who are so disposed , shall find out their = Chance =, in the = Lotteries = aforegoing . Turne about one of the Indexes in the Figures , which are in the following Page , without casting your eyes thereupon , so observe where it stayeth untill your hand ceaseth to give it motion . If it be the upper Figure , whose Index you moved ; than , that Number whereupon it resteth , is the number of your Lot , or Blancke . This being knowne , move the other Index in like manner , and that Quarter of the said Figure whereon the same standeth ( when your hand is taken away ) sheweth in which of the foure Bookes , or Lotteries , that Chance is to be expected , whereunto your Number doth send you , whether it be Lot , or Blancke . If it be any Number above Fifty , it is a Blancke Chance , and you are to looke no further . If it be any of the other Numbers , it sends you to the Emblem answering to the same Number , in the Booke next before the same Lotterie . If the letter M. be placed before the alotted Number ; then , that Lot is proper onely to a Man : If W. stand before it , it is proper onely to a Woman : if there be no letter , it is indifferent to both Sexes : And , therefore , when a Man or Woman happneth on a Chance impertinent to their proper Sexe , they are then , to take the next Chance which pertaineth properly to their Sexe , whether it be Blancke or Lot ; the triall whereof , I have thus contrived , without the use of Dice ; lest by bringing them into sight , they might , sometimes , occasion worse Gaming .
