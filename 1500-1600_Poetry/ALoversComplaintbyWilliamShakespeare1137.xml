     <l n="2">From off a hill whose concave womb reworded</l>
     <l n="3">A plaintful story from a sist'ring vale ,</l>
     <l n="4">My spirits t'attend this double voice accorded ,</l>
     <l n="5">And down I laid to list the sad-tuned tale ,</l>
     <l n="6">Ere long espied a fickle maid full pale ,</l>
     <l n="7">Tearing of papers , breaking rings atwain ,</l>
     <l n="8">Storming her world with sorrow 's wind and rain .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">Upon her head a platted hive of straw ,</l>
     <l n="10">Which fortified her visage from the sun ,</l>
     <l n="11">Whereon the thought might think sometime it saw</l>
     <l n="12">The carcase of a beauty spent and done .</l>
     <l n="13">Time had not scythed all that youth begun ,</l>
     <l n="14">Nor youth all quit , but spite of heaven 's fell rage</l>
     <l n="15">Some beauty peeped through lattice of seared age .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="16">Oft did she heave her napkin to her eyne ,</l>
     <l n="17">Which on it had conceited characters ,</l>
     <l n="18">Laund'ring the silken figures in the brine</l>
     <l n="19">That seasoned woe had pelleted in tears ,</l>
     <l n="20">And often reading what contents it bears ;</l>
     <l n="21">As often shrieking undistinguished woe ,</l>
     <l n="22">In clamours of all size , both high and low .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="23">Sometimes her levelled eyes their carriage ride ,</l>
     <l n="24">As they did batt'ry to the spheres intend ;</l>
     <l n="25">Sometime diverted their poor balls are tied</l>
     <l n="26">To th ’ orbed earth ; sometimes they do extend</l>
     <l n="27">Their view right on ; anon their gazes lend</l>
     <l n="28">To every place at once , and nowhere fixed ,</l>
     <l n="29">The mind and sight distractedly commixed .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="30">Her hair , nor loose nor tied in formal plat ,</l>
     <l n="31">Proclaimed in her a careless hand of pride ;</l>
     <l n="32">For some , untucked , descended her sheaved hat ,</l>
     <l n="33">Hanging her pale and pined cheek beside ;</l>
     <l n="34">Some in her threaden fillet still did bide ,</l>
     <l n="35">And , true to bondage , would not break from thence ,</l>
     <l n="36">Though slackly braided in loose negligence .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="37">A thousand favours from a maund she drew</l>
     <l n="38">Of amber , crystal , and of beaded jet ,</l>
     <l n="39">Which one by one she in a river threw ,</l>
     <l n="40">Upon whose weeping margent she was set ;</l>
     <l n="41">Like usury applying wet to wet ,</l>
     <l n="42">Or monarchs ’ hands that lets not bounty fall</l>
     <l n="43">Where want cries some , but where excess begs all .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="44">Of folded schedules had she many a one ,</l>
     <l n="45">Which she perused , sighed , tore , and gave the flood ;</l>
     <l n="46">Cracked many a ring of posied gold and bone ,</l>
     <l n="47">Bidding them find their sepulchres in mud ;</l>
     <l n="48">Found yet moe letters sadly penned in blood ,</l>
     <l n="49">With sleided silk feat and affectedly</l>
     <l n="50">Enswathed and sealed to curious secrecy .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="51">These often bathed she in her fluxive eyes ,</l>
     <l n="52">And often kissed , and often ‘ gan to tear ;</l>
     <l n="53">Cried , ‘ O false blood , thou register of lies ,</l>
     <l n="54">What unapproved witness dost thou bear !</l>
     <l n="55">Ink would have seemed more black and damned here !</l>
     <l n="56">This said , in top of rage the lines she rents ,</l>
     <l n="57">Big discontents so breaking their contents .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="58">A reverend man that grazed his cattle nigh ,</l>
     <l n="59">Sometime a blusterer that the ruffle knew</l>
     <l n="60">Of court , of city , and had let go by</l>
     <l n="61">The swiftest hours observed as they flew ,</l>
     <l n="62">Towards this afflicted fancy fastly drew ;</l>
     <l n="63">And , privileged by age , desires to know</l>
     <l n="64">In brief the grounds and motives of her woe .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="65">So slides he down upon his grained bat ,</l>
     <l n="66">And comely distant sits he by her side ;</l>
     <l n="67">When he again desires her , being sat ,</l>
     <l n="68">Her grievance with his hearing to divide .</l>
     <l n="69">If that from him there may be aught applied</l>
     <l n="70">Which may her suffering ecstasy assuage ,</l>
     <l n="71">‘ Tis promised in the charity of age .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="72">‘ Father , ’ she says , ‘ though in me you behold</l>
     <l n="73">The injury of many a blasting hour ,</l>
     <l n="74">Let it not tell your judgement I am old :</l>
     <l n="75">Not age , but sorrow , over me hath power .</l>
     <l n="76">I might as yet have been a spreading flower ,</l>
     <l n="77">Fresh to myself , if I had self-applied</l>
     <l n="78">Love to myself , and to no love beside .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="79">‘ But woe is me ! too early I attended</l>
     <l n="80">A youthful suit - it was to gain my grace-</l>

     <l n="82">That maidens ’ eyes stuck over all his face .</l>
     <l n="83">Love lacked a dwelling and made him her place ;</l>
     <l n="84">And when in his fair parts she did abide ,</l>
     <l n="85">She was new lodged and newly deified .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="86">‘ His browny locks did hang in crooked curls ;</l>
     <l n="87">And every light occasion of the wind</l>
     <l n="88">Upon his lips their silken parcels hurls .</l>
     <l n="89">What 's sweet to do , to do will aptly find :</l>
     <l n="90">Each eye that saw him did enchant the mind ;</l>
     <l n="91">For on his visage was in little drawn</l>
     <l n="92">What largeness thinks in Paradise was sawn .</l>
    </lg>

     <l n="93">‘ Small show of man was yet upon his chin ;</l>

     <l n="96">Whose bare out-bragged the web it seemed to wear :</l>
     <l n="97">Yet showed his visage by that cost more dear ;</l>
     <l n="98">And nice affections wavering stood in doubt</l>

     <l n="103">As oft ‘ twixt May and April is to see ,</l>
     <l n="104">When winds breathe sweet , unruly though they be .</l>
     <l n="105">His rudeness so with his authorized youth</l>
