    <head>TO THE</head>
    <head>RIGHT HONOURABLE HENRY WRIOTHESLY ,</head>
    <head>EARL OF SOUTHAMPTON , AND BARON OF TITCHFIELD .</head>
    <head>THE love I dedicate to your Lordship is without end ; whereof this pamphlet , without beginning , is but a superfluous moiety . The warrant I have of your honourable disposition , not the worth of my untutored lines , makes it assured of acceptance . What I have done is yours ; what I have to do is yours ; being part in all I have , devoted yours . Were my worth greater , my duty would show greater ; meantime , as it is , it is bound to your Lordship , to whom I wish long life , still lengthened with all happiness .</head>
     <l n="1">Your Lordship 's in all duty ,</l>

    <head>THE ARGUMENT .</head>
    <head>LUCIUS TARQUINIUS ( for his excessive pride surnamed Superbus ) , after he had caused his own father-in-law , Servius Tullius , to be cruelly murdered , and , contrary to the Roman laws and customs , not requiring or staying for the people 's suffrages , had possessed himself of the kingdom , went , accompanied with his sons and other noblemen of Rome , to besiege Ardea . During which siege the principal men of the army meeting one evening at the tent of Sextus Tarquinius , the king 's son , in their discourses after supper , every one commended the virtues of his own wife ; among whom Collatinus extolled the incomparable chastity of his wife Lucretia . In that pleasant humour they all posted to Rome ; and intending , by their secret and sudden arrival , to make trial of that which every one had before avouched , only Collatinus finds his wife , though it were late in the night , spinning amongst her maids : the other ladies were all found dancing and revelling , or in several disports . Whereupon the noblemen yielded Collatinus the victory , and his wife the fame . At that time Sextus Tarquinius being inflamed with Lucrece 's beauty , yet smothering his passions for the present , departed with the rest back to the camp ; from whence he shortly after privily withdrew himself , and was ( according to his estate ) royally entertained and lodged by Lucrece at Collatium . The same night he treacherously stealeth into her chamber , violently ravished her , and early in the morning speedeth away . Lucrece , in this lamentable plight , hastily dispatched messengers , one to Rome for her father , another to the camp for Collatine . They came , the one accompanied with Junius Brutus , the other with Publius Valerius ; and finding Lucrece attired in mourning habit , demanded the cause of her sorrow . She , first taking an oath of them for her revenge , revealed the actor , and whole manner of his dealing , and withal suddenly stabbed herself . Which done , with one consent they all vowed to root out the whole hated family of the Tarquins ; and bearing the dead body to Rome , Brutus acquainted the people with the doer and manner of the vile deed , with a bitter invective against the tyranny of the king ; wherewith the people were so moved , that with one consent and a general acclamation the Tarquins were all exiled , and the state government changed from kings to consuls .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="1">From the besieged Ardea all in post ,</l>
     <l n="2">Borne by the trustless wings of false desire ,</l>
     <l n="3">Lust-breathed Tarquin leaves the Roman host ,</l>
     <l n="4">And to Collatium bears the lightless fire</l>
     <l n="5">Which , in pale embers hid , lurks to aspire</l>
     <l n="6">And girdle with embracing flames the waist</l>
     <l n="7">Of Collatine 's fair love , Lucrece the chaste .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="8">Haply that name of chaste unhapp'ly set</l>
     <l n="9">This bateless edge on his keen appetite ;</l>
     <l n="10">When Collatine unwisely did not let</l>
     <l n="11">To praise the clear unmatched red and white</l>
     <l n="12">Which triumph 'd in that sky of his delight ,</l>
     <l n="13">Where mortal stars , as bright as heaven 's beauties ,</l>
     <l n="14">With pure aspects did him peculiar duties .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="15">For he the night before , in Tarquin 's tent ,</l>
     <l n="16">Unlock 'd the treasure of his happy state ;</l>
     <l n="17">What priceless wealth the heavens had him lent</l>
     <l n="18">In the possession of his beauteous mate ;</l>
     <l n="19">Reckoning his fortune at such high-proud rate ,</l>
     <l n="20">That kings might be espoused to more fame ,</l>
     <l n="21">But king nor peer to such a peerless dame .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="22">O happiness enjoy 'd but of a few !</l>
     <l n="23">And , if possess 'd , as soon decay 'd and done</l>
     <l n="24">As is the morning 's silver-melting dew</l>
     <l n="25">Against the golden splendour of the sun !</l>
     <l n="26">An expir 'd date , cancell 'd ere well begun :</l>
     <l n="27">Honour and beauty , in the owner 's arms ,</l>
     <l n="28">Are weakly fortress 'd from a world of harms .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="29">Beauty itself doth of itself persuade</l>
     <l n="30">The eyes of men without an orator ;</l>
     <l n="31">What needeth then apologies be made ,</l>
     <l n="32">To set forth that which is so singular ?</l>
     <l n="33">Or why is Collatine the publisher</l>
     <l n="34">Of that rich jewel he should keep unknown</l>
     <l n="35">From thievish ears , because it is his own ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="36">Perchance his boast of Lucrece ’ sovereignty</l>
     <l n="37">Suggested this proud issue of a king ;</l>
     <l n="38">For by our ears our hearts oft tainted be :</l>
     <l n="39">Perchance that envy of so rich a thing ,</l>
     <l n="40">Braving compare , disdainfully did sting</l>
     <l n="41">His high-pitch 'd thoughts , that meaner men should vaunt</l>
     <l n="42">That golden hap which their superiors want .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="43">But some untimely thought did instigate</l>
     <l n="44">His all-too-timeless speed , if none of those ;</l>
     <l n="45">His honour , his affairs , his friends , his state ,</l>
     <l n="46">Neglected all , with swift intent he goes</l>
     <l n="47">To quench the coal which in his liver glows .</l>
     <l n="48">O rash false heat , wrapp 'd in repentant cold ,</l>
     <l n="49">Thy hasty spring still blasts , and ne'er grows old !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="50">When at Collatium this false lord arriv 'd ,</l>
     <l n="51">Well was he welcom 'd by the Roman dame ,</l>
     <l n="52">Within whose face beauty and virtue striv 'd</l>
     <l n="53">Which of them both should underprop her fame :</l>
     <l n="54">When virtue bragg 'd , beauty would blush for shame ;</l>
     <l n="55">When beauty boasted blushes , in despite</l>
     <l n="56">Virtue would stain that or with silver white .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="57">But beauty , in that white intituled ,</l>
     <l n="58">From Venus ’ doves doth challenge that fair field :</l>
     <l n="59">Then virtue claims from beauty beauty 's red ,</l>
     <l n="60">Which virtue gave the golden age , to gild</l>
     <l n="61">Their silver cheeks , and call 'd it then their shield ;</l>
     <l n="62">Teaching them thus to use it in the fight ,—</l>
     <l n="63">When shame assail 'd , the red should fence the white .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="64">This heraldry in Lucrece ’ face was seen ,</l>
     <l n="65">Argued by beauty 's red , and virtue 's white :</l>
     <l n="66">Of either 's colour was the other queen ,</l>
     <l n="67">Proving from world 's minority their right :</l>
     <l n="68">Yet their ambition makes them still to fight ;</l>
     <l n="69">The sovereignty of either being so great ,</l>
     <l n="70">That oft they interchange each other 's seat .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="71">Their silent war of lilies and of roses ,</l>
     <l n="72">Which Tarquin view 'd in her fair face 's field ,</l>
     <l n="73">In their pure ranks his traitor eye encloses ;</l>
     <l n="74">Where , lest between them both it should be kill 'd ,</l>
     <l n="75">The coward captive vanquish 'd doth yield</l>
     <l n="76">To those two armies that would let him go ,</l>
     <l n="77">Rather than triumph in so false a foe .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="78">Now thinks he that her husband 's shallow tongue ,</l>
     <l n="79">( The niggard prodigal that prais 'd her so )</l>
     <l n="80">In that high task hath done her beauty wrong ,</l>
     <l n="81">Which far exceeds his barren skill to show :</l>
     <l n="82">Therefore that praise which Collatine doth owe</l>
     <l n="83">Enchanted Tarquin answers with surmise ,</l>
     <l n="84">In silent wonder of still-gazing eyes .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="85">This earthly saint , adored by this devil ,</l>
     <l n="86">Little suspecteth the false worshipper ;</l>
     <l n="87">For unstain 'd thoughts do seldom dream on evil ;</l>
     <l n="88">Birds never lim 'd no secret bushes fear :</l>
     <l n="89">So guiltless she securely gives good cheer</l>
     <l n="90">And reverend welcome to her princely guest ,</l>
     <l n="91">Whose inward ill no outward harm express 'd :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="92">For that he colour 'd with his high estate ,</l>
     <l n="93">Hiding base sin in plaits of majesty ;</l>
     <l n="94">That nothing in him seem 'd inordinate ,</l>
     <l n="95">Save sometime too much wonder of his eye ,</l>
     <l n="96">Which , having all , all could not satisfy ;</l>
     <l n="97">But , poorly rich , so wanteth in his store ,</l>
     <l n="98">That , cloy 'd with much , he pineth still for more .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="99">But she , that never cop 'd with stranger eyes ,</l>
     <l n="100">Could pick no meaning from their parling looks ,</l>
     <l n="101">Nor read the subtle-shining secrecies</l>
     <l n="102">Writ in the glassy margents of such books ;</l>
     <l n="103">She touch 'd no unknown baits , nor fear 'd no hooks ;</l>
     <l n="104">Nor could she moralize his wanton sight ,</l>
     <l n="105">More than his eyes were open 'd to the light .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="106">He stories to her ears her husband 's fame ,</l>
     <l n="107">Won in the fields of fruitful Italy ;</l>
     <l n="108">And decks with praises Collatine 's high name ,</l>
     <l n="109">Made glorious by his manly chivalry</l>
     <l n="110">With bruised arms and wreaths of victory :</l>
     <l n="111">Her joy with heav'dhYpppHeNup hand she doth express ,</l>
     <l n="112">And , wordless , so greets heaven for his success .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="113">Far from the purpose of his coming hither ,</l>
     <l n="114">He makes excuses for his being there .</l>
     <l n="115">No cloudy show of stormy blustering weather</l>
     <l n="116">Doth yet in his fair welkin once appear ;</l>
     <l n="117">Till sable Night , mother of Dread and Fear ,</l>
     <l n="118">Upon the world dim darkness doth display ,</l>
     <l n="119">And in her vaulty prison stows the day .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="19">
     <l n="120">For then is Tarquin brought unto his bed ,</l>
     <l n="121">Intending weariness with heavy spright ;</l>
     <l n="122">For , after supper , long he questioned</l>
     <l n="123">With modest Lucrece , and wore out the night :</l>
     <l n="124">Now leaden slumber with life 's strength doth fight ;</l>
     <l n="125">And every one to rest themselves betake ,</l>
     <l n="126">Save thieves , and cares , and troubled minds , that wake .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="20">
     <l n="127">As one of which doth Tarquin lie revolving</l>

     <l n="129">Yet ever to obtain his will resolving ,</l>
     <l n="130">Though weak-built hopes persuade him to abstaining :</l>
     <l n="131">Despair to gain doth traffic oft for gaining ;</l>
     <l n="132">And when great treasure is the meed propos 'd ,</l>
     <l n="133">Though death be adjunct , there 's no death suppos 'd .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="21">
     <l n="134">Those that much covet are with gain so fond ,</l>

     <l n="137">And so , by hoping more , they have but less ;</l>
     <l n="138">Or , gaining more , the profit of excess</l>
     <l n="139">Is but to surfeit , and such griefs sustain ,</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="22">
     <l n="141">The aim of all is but to nurse the life</l>

     <l n="144">That one for all , or all for one we gage ;</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="23">
     <l n="148">So that in vent'ring ill we leave to be</l>
