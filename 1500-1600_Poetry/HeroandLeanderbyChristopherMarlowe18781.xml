    <head>FIRST SESTIAD</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">On Hellespont , guilty of true-love 's blood ,</l>
     <l n="2">In view and opposite two cities stood ,</l>
     <l n="3">Sea-borderers , disjoined by Neptune 's might ;</l>
     <l n="4">The one Abydos , the other Sestos hight .</l>
     <l n="5">At Sestos Hero dwelt ; Hero the fair ,</l>
     <l n="6">Whom young Apollo courted for her hair ,</l>
     <l n="7">And offered as a dower his burning throne ,</l>
     <l n="8">Where she should sit for men to gaze upon .</l>
     <l n="9">The outside of her garments were of lawn ,</l>
     <l n="10">The lining purple silk , with gilt stars drawn ;</l>
     <l n="11">Her wide sleeves green , and bordered with a grove ,</l>
     <l n="12">Where Venus in her naked glory strove</l>
     <l n="13">To please the careless and disdainful eyes</l>
     <l n="14">Of proud Adonis , that before her lies .</l>
     <l n="15">Her kirtle blue , whereon was many a stain ,</l>
     <l n="16">Made with the blood of wretched lovers slain .</l>
     <l n="17">Upon her head she ware a myrtle wreath ,</l>
     <l n="18">From whence her veil reached to the ground beneath .</l>
     <l n="19">Her veil was artificial flowers and leaves</l>
     <l n="20">Whose workmanship both man and beast deceives .</l>
     <l n="21">Many would praise the sweet smell as she passed ,</l>
     <l n="22">When ‘ twas the odour which her breath forth cast ;</l>
     <l n="23">And there for honey bees have sought in vain ,</l>
     <l n="24">And , beat from thence , have lighted there again .</l>
     <l n="25">About her neck hung chains of pebblestone ,</l>
     <l n="26">Which , lightened by her neck , like diamonds shone .</l>
     <l n="27">She ware no gloves ; for neither sun nor wind</l>
     <l n="28">Would burn or parch her hands , but to her mind ,</l>
     <l n="29">Or warm or cool them , for they took delight</l>
     <l n="30">To play upon those hands , they were so white .</l>
     <l n="31">Buskins of shells , all silvered used she ,</l>
     <l n="32">And branched with blushing coral to the knee ;</l>
     <l n="33">Where sparrows perched of hollow pearl and gold ,</l>
     <l n="34">Such as the world would wonder to behold .</l>
     <l n="35">Those with sweet water oft her handmaid fills ,</l>
     <l n="36">Which , as she went , would chirrup through the bills .</l>
     <l n="37">Some say for her the fairest Cupid pined</l>
     <l n="38">And looking in her face was strooken blind .</l>
     <l n="39">But this is true : so like was one the other ,</l>
     <l n="40">As he imagined Hero was his mother .</l>
     <l n="41">And oftentimes into her bosom flew ,</l>
     <l n="42">About her naked neck his bare arms threw ,</l>
     <l n="43">And laid his childish head upon her breast ,</l>
     <l n="44">And , with still panting rocked , there took his rest .</l>
     <l n="45">So lovely fair was Hero , Venus ’ nun ,</l>
     <l n="46">As Nature wept , thinking she was undone ,</l>
     <l n="47">Because she took more from her than she left ,</l>
     <l n="48">And of such wondrous beauty her bereft .</l>
     <l n="49">Therefore , in sign her treasure suffered wrack ,</l>
     <l n="50">Since Hero 's time hath half the world been black .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="51">Amorous Leander , beautiful and young ,</l>
     <l n="52">( whose tragedy divine Musaeus sung ,)</l>
     <l n="53">Dwelt at Abydos ; since him dwelt there none</l>
     <l n="54">For whom succeeding times make greater moan .</l>
     <l n="55">His dangling tresses , that were never shorn ,</l>
     <l n="56">Had they been cut , and unto Colchos borne ,</l>
     <l n="57">Would have allured the vent'rous youth of Greece</l>
     <l n="58">To hazard more than for the golden fleece .</l>
     <l n="59">Fair Cynthia wished his arms might be her sphere ;</l>
     <l n="60">Grief makes her pale , because she moves not there .</l>
     <l n="61">His body was as straight as Circe 's wand ;</l>
     <l n="62">Jove might have sipped out nectar from his hand .</l>
     <l n="63">Even as delicious meat is to the taste ,</l>
     <l n="64">So was his neck in touching , and surpassed</l>
     <l n="65">The white of Pelop 's shoulder . I could tell ye</l>
     <l n="66">How smooth his breast was and how white his belly ;</l>
     <l n="67">And whose immortal fingers did imprint</l>
     <l n="68">That heavenly path with many a curious dint</l>
     <l n="69">That runs along his back , but my rude pen</l>
     <l n="70">Can hardly blazon forth the loves of men ,</l>
     <l n="71">Much less of powerful gods . Let it suffice</l>
     <l n="72">That my slack Muse sings of Leander 's eyes ,</l>
     <l n="73">Those orient cheeks and lips , exceeding his</l>
     <l n="74">That leaped into the water for a kiss</l>
     <l n="75">Of his own shadow and , despising many ,</l>
     <l n="76">Died ere he could enjoy the love of any .</l>
     <l n="77">Had wild Hippolytus Leander seen</l>
     <l n="78">Enamoured of his beauty had he been .</l>
     <l n="79">His presence made the rudest peasant melt</l>
     <l n="80">That in the vast uplandish country dwelt .</l>
     <l n="81">The barbarous Thracian soldier , moved with nought ,</l>
     <l n="82">Was moved with him and for his favour sought .</l>
     <l n="83">Some swore he was a maid in man 's attire ,</l>
     <l n="84">For in his looks were all that men desire ,</l>
     <l n="85">A pleasant smiling cheek , a speaking eye ,</l>
     <l n="86">A brow for love to banquet royally ;</l>
     <l n="87">And such as knew he was a man , would say ,</l>
     <l n="88">“ Leander , thou art made for amorous play .</l>
     <l n="89">Why art thou not in love , and loved of all ?</l>
     <l n="90">Though thou be fair , yet be not thine own thrall . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="91">The men of wealthy Sestos every year ,</l>
     <l n="92">( For his sake whom their goddess held so dear ,</l>
     <l n="93">Rose-cheeked Adonis ) kept a solemn feast .</l>
     <l n="94">Thither resorted many a wandering guest</l>
     <l n="95">To meet their loves .</l>
     <l n="96">Such as had none at all ,</l>
     <l n="97">Came lovers home from this great festival .</l>
     <l n="98">For every street like to a firmament</l>
     <l n="99">Glistered with breathing stars who , where they went ,</l>
     <l n="100">Frighted the melancholy earth which deemed</l>
     <l n="101">Eternal heaven to burn , for so it seemed ,</l>
     <l n="102">As if another Phaeton had got</l>
     <l n="103">The guidance of the sun 's rich chariot .</l>
     <l n="104">But far above the loveliest Hero shined</l>
     <l n="105">And stole away th ’ enchanted gazer 's mind ,</l>
     <l n="106">For like sea nymphs ’ enveigling Harmony ,</l>
     <l n="107">So was her beauty to the standers by .</l>
     <l n="108">Nor that night-wandering , pale , and wat'ry star</l>
     <l n="109">( When yawning dragons draw her thirling car</l>
     <l n="110">From Latmus ’ mount up to the gloomy sky</l>
     <l n="111">Where , crowned with blazing light and majesty ,</l>
     <l n="112">She proudly sits ) more overrules the flood</l>
     <l n="113">Than she the hearts of those that near her stood .</l>
     <l n="114">Even as , when gaudy nymphs pursue the chase ,</l>
     <l n="115">Wretched Ixion 's shaggy footed race ,</l>
     <l n="116">Incensed with savage heat , gallop amain</l>
     <l n="117">From steep pine-bearing mountains to the plain .</l>
     <l n="118">So ran the people forth to gaze upon her ,</l>
     <l n="119">And all that viewed her were enamoured on her .</l>
     <l n="120">And as in fury of a dreadful fight ,</l>
     <l n="121">Their fellows being slain or put to flight ,</l>
     <l n="122">Poor soldiers stand with fear of death dead strooken ,</l>
     <l n="123">So at her presence all surprised and tooken ,</l>
     <l n="124">Await the sentence of her scornful eyes .</l>
     <l n="125">He whom she favours lives , the other dies .</l>
     <l n="126">There might you see one sigh , another rage ;</l>
     <l n="127">And some , ( their violent passions to assuage )</l>
     <l n="128">Compile sharp satires , but alas too late ,</l>
     <l n="129">For faithful love will never turn to hate .</l>
     <l n="130">And many seeing great princes were denied</l>
     <l n="131">Pin 'd as they went , and thinking on her died .</l>
     <l n="132">On this feast day , O cursed day and hour ,</l>
     <l n="133">Went Hero thorough Sestos from her tower</l>
     <l n="134">To Venus ’ temple , where unhappily</l>
     <l n="135">As after chanced , they did each other spy .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="136">So fair a church as this had Venus none .</l>
     <l n="137">The walls were of discoloured jasper stone</l>
     <l n="138">Wherein was Proteus carved , and o'erhead</l>
     <l n="139">A lively vine of green sea agate spread ,</l>
     <l n="140">Where by one hand lightheaded Bacchus hung ,</l>
     <l n="141">And , with the other , wine from grapes out wrung .</l>
     <l n="142">Of crystal shining fair the pavement was .</l>
     <l n="143">The town of Sestos called it Venus ’ glass .</l>
     <l n="144">There might you see the gods in sundry shapes</l>
     <l n="145">Committing heady riots , incest , rapes .</l>
     <l n="146">For know , that underneath this radiant floor</l>
     <l n="147">Was Danae 's statue in a brazen tower ,</l>
     <l n="148">Jove slyly stealing from his sister 's bed ,</l>
     <l n="149">To dally with Idalian Ganymede ,</l>
     <l n="150">And for his love Europa bellowing loud ,</l>
     <l n="151">And tumbling with the Rainbow in a cloud ;</l>
     <l n="152">Blood quaffing Mars heaving the iron net</l>
     <l n="153">Which limping Vulcan and his Cyclops set ;</l>
     <l n="154">Love kindling fire to burn such towns as Troy ;</l>
     <l n="155">Sylvanus weeping for the lovely boy</l>
     <l n="156">That now is turned into a cypress tree ,</l>
     <l n="157">Under whose shade the wood gods love to be .</l>
     <l n="158">And in the midst a silver altar stood .</l>
     <l n="159">There Hero , sacrificing turtle 's blood ,</l>
     <l n="160">Vailed to the ground , vailing her eyelids close ,</l>
     <l n="161">And modestly they opened as she rose .</l>
     <l n="162">Thence flew Love 's arrow with the golden head ,</l>
     <l n="163">And thus Leander was enamoured .</l>
     <l n="164">Stone still he stood , and evermore he gazed</l>
     <l n="165">Till with the fire that from his countenance blazed</l>
     <l n="166">Relenting Hero 's gentle heart was strook .</l>
     <l n="167">Such force and virtue hath an amorous look .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="168">It lies not in our power to love or hate ,</l>
     <l n="169">For will in us is overruled by fate .</l>
     <l n="170">When two are stripped , long ere the course begin</l>
     <l n="171">We wish that one should lose , the other win .</l>
     <l n="172">And one especially do we affect</l>
     <l n="173">Of two gold ingots like in each respect .</l>
     <l n="174">The reason no man knows ; let it suffice</l>
     <l n="175">What we behold is censured by our eyes .</l>
     <l n="176">Where both deliberate , the love is slight :</l>
     <l n="177">Who ever loved , that loved not at first sight ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="178">He kneeled , but unto her devoutly prayed .</l>
     <l n="179">Chaste Hero to herself thus softly said ,</l>
     <l n="180">“ Were I the saint he worships , I would hear him ; ”</l>
     <l n="181">And , as she spake those words , came somewhat near him .</l>
     <l n="182">He started up , she blushed as one ashamed ,</l>
     <l n="183">Wherewith Leander much more was inflamed .</l>
     <l n="184">He touched her hand ; in touching it she trembled .</l>
     <l n="185">Love deeply grounded , hardly is dissembled .</l>
     <l n="186">These lovers parleyed by the touch of hands ;</l>
     <l n="187">True love is mute , and oft amazed stands .</l>
     <l n="188">Thus while dumb signs their yielding hearts entangled ,</l>
     <l n="189">The air with sparks of living fire was spangled ,</l>
     <l n="190">And night , deep drenched in misty Acheron ,</l>
     <l n="191">Heaved up her head , and half the world upon</l>
     <l n="192">Breathed darkness forth ( dark night is Cupid 's day ) .</l>
     <l n="193">And now begins Leander to display</l>
     <l n="194">Love 's holy fire , with words , with sighs , and tears ,</l>
     <l n="195">Which like sweet music entered Hero 's ears ,</l>
     <l n="196">And yet at every word she turned aside ,</l>
     <l n="197">And always cut him off as he replied .</l>
     <l n="198">At last , like to a bold sharp sophister ,</l>
     <l n="199">With cheerful hope thus he accosted her .</l>
     <l n="200">“ Fair creature , let me speak without offence .</l>
     <l n="201">I would my rude words had the influence</l>
     <l n="202">To lead thy thoughts as thy fair looks do mine ,</l>
     <l n="203">Then shouldst thou be his prisoner , who is thine .</l>
     <l n="204">Be not unkind and fair ; misshapen stuff</l>
     <l n="205">Are of behaviour boisterous and rough .</l>
     <l n="206">O shun me not , but hear me ere you go .</l>
     <l n="207">God knows I cannot force love as you do .</l>
     <l n="208">My words shall be as spotless as my youth ,</l>
     <l n="209">Full of simplicity and naked truth .</l>
     <l n="210">This sacrifice , ( whose sweet perfume descending</l>
     <l n="211">From Venus ’ altar , to your footsteps bending )</l>
     <l n="212">Doth testify that you exceed her far ,</l>
     <l n="213">To whom you offer , and whose nun you are .</l>
     <l n="214">Why should you worship her ? Her you surpass</l>
     <l n="215">As much as sparkling diamonds flaring glass .</l>
     <l n="216">A diamond set in lead his worth retains ;</l>
     <l n="217">A heavenly nymph , beloved of human swains ,</l>
     <l n="218">Receives no blemish , but ofttimes more grace ;</l>
     <l n="219">Which makes me hope , although I am but base :</l>
     <l n="220">Base in respect of thee , divine and pure ,</l>
     <l n="221">Dutiful service may thy love procure .</l>
     <l n="222">And I in duty will excel all other ,</l>
     <l n="223">As thou in beauty dost exceed Love 's mother .</l>
     <l n="224">Nor heaven , nor thou , were made to gaze upon ,</l>
     <l n="225">As heaven preserves all things , so save thou one .</l>
     <l n="226">A stately builded ship , well rigged and tall ,</l>
     <l n="227">The ocean maketh more majestical .</l>
     <l n="228">Why vowest thou then to live in Sestos here</l>
     <l n="229">Who on Love 's seas more glorious wouldst appear ?</l>
     <l n="230">Like untuned golden strings all women are ,</l>
     <l n="231">Which long time lie untouched , will harshly jar .</l>
     <l n="232">Vessels of brass , oft handled , brightly shine .</l>
     <l n="233">What difference betwixt the richest mine</l>
     <l n="234">And basest mould , but use ? For both , not used ,</l>
     <l n="235">Are of like worth . Then treasure is abused</l>
     <l n="236">When misers keep it ; being put to loan ,</l>
     <l n="237">In time it will return us two for one .</l>
     <l n="238">Rich robes themselves and others do adorn ;</l>
     <l n="239">Neither themselves nor others , if not worn .</l>
     <l n="240">Who builds a palace and rams up the gate</l>
     <l n="241">Shall see it ruinous and desolate .</l>
     <l n="242">Ah , simple Hero , learn thyself to cherish .</l>
     <l n="243">Lone women like to empty houses perish .</l>
     <l n="244">Less sins the poor rich man that starves himself</l>
     <l n="245">In heaping up a mass of drossy pelf ,</l>
     <l n="246">Than such as you . His golden earth remains</l>
     <l n="247">Which , after his decease , some other gains .</l>
     <l n="248">But this fair gem , sweet in the loss alone ,</l>
     <l n="249">When you fleet hence , can be bequeathed to none .</l>
     <l n="250">Or , if it could , down from th'enameled sky</l>
     <l n="251">All heaven would come to claim this legacy ,</l>
     <l n="252">And with intestine broils the world destroy ,</l>
     <l n="253">And quite confound nature 's sweet harmony .</l>
     <l n="254">Well therefore by the gods decreed it is</l>
     <l n="255">We human creatures should enjoy that bliss .</l>
     <l n="256">One is no number ; maids are nothing then</l>
     <l n="257">Without the sweet society of men .</l>
     <l n="258">Wilt thou live single still ? One shalt thou be ,</l>
     <l n="259">Though never singling Hymen couple thee .</l>
     <l n="260">Wild savages , that drink of running springs ,</l>
     <l n="261">Think water far excels all earthly things ,</l>
     <l n="262">But they that daily taste neat wine despise it .</l>
     <l n="263">Virginity , albeit some highly prize it ,</l>

     <l n="426">And neither would deny nor grant his suit .</l>

     <l n="436">Stole some from Hebe ( Hebe Jove 's cup filled )</l>

     <l n="442">In mournful terms , with sad and heavy cheer ,</l>
     <l n="443">Complained to Cupid . Cupid for his sake ,</l>
     <l n="444">To be revenged on Jove did undertake .</l>
     <l n="445">And those on whom heaven , earth , and hell relies ,</l>
     <l n="446">I mean the adamantine Destinies ,</l>
     <l n="447">He wounds with love , and forced them equally</l>
     <l n="448">To dote upon deceitful Mercury .</l>
     <l n="449">They offered him the deadly fatal knife</l>
     <l n="450">That shears the slender threads of human life .</l>
     <l n="451">At his fair feathered feet the engines laid</l>
     <l n="452">Which th ’ earth from ugly Chaos ’ den upweighed .</l>
     <l n="453">These he regarded not but did entreat</l>
     <l n="454">That Jove , usurper of his father 's seat ,</l>
     <l n="455">Might presently be banished into hell ,</l>
     <l n="456">And aged Saturn in Olympus dwell .</l>
     <l n="457">They granted what he craved , and once again</l>
     <l n="458">Saturn and Ops began their golden reign .</l>
     <l n="459">Murder , rape , war , lust , and treachery ,</l>
     <l n="460">Were with Jove closed in Stygian empery .</l>
     <l n="461">But long this blessed time continued not .</l>

     <l n="464">The love of th ’ everlasting Destinies .</l>
     <l n="465">They seeing it both love and him abhorred</l>

     <l n="469">And to the seat of Jove itself advance ,</l>
     <l n="470">Hermes had slept in hell with Ignorance .</l>
     <l n="471">Yet as a punishment they added this ,</l>
     <l n="472">That he and Poverty should always kiss .</l>
     <l n="473">And to this day is every scholar poor ;</l>
     <l n="474">Gross gold from them runs headlong to the boor .</l>
     <l n="475">Likewise the angry Sisters thus deluded ,</l>

     <l n="479">And fruitful wits , that in aspiring are ,</l>

     <l n="481">And few great lords in virtuous deeds shall joy</l>
     <l n="482">But be surprised with every garish toy ,</l>
     <l n="483">And still enrich the lofty servile clown ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">By this , sad Hero , with love unacquainted ,</l>
     <l n="2">Viewing Leander 's face , fell down and fainted .</l>
     <l n="3">He kissed her and breathed life into her lips ,</l>
     <l n="4">Wherewith as one displeased away she trips .</l>
     <l n="5">Yet , as she went , full often looked behind ,</l>
     <l n="6">And many poor excuses did she find</l>
     <l n="7">To linger by the way , and once she stayed ,</l>
     <l n="8">And would have turned again , but was afraid ,</l>
     <l n="9">In offering parley , to be counted light .</l>
     <l n="10">So on she goes and in her idle flight</l>
     <l n="11">Her painted fan of curled plumes let fall ,</l>
     <l n="12">Thinking to train Leander therewithal .</l>
     <l n="13">He , being a novice , knew not what she meant</l>
     <l n="14">But stayed , and after her a letter sent ,</l>
     <l n="15">Which joyful Hero answered in such sort ,</l>
     <l n="16">As he had hope to scale the beauteous fort</l>
     <l n="17">Wherein the liberal Graces locked their wealth ,</l>
     <l n="18">And therefore to her tower he got by stealth .</l>
     <l n="19">Wide open stood the door , he need not climb ,</l>
     <l n="20">And she herself before the pointed time</l>
     <l n="21">Had spread the board , with roses strowed the room ,</l>
     <l n="22">And oft looked out , and mused he did not come .</l>
     <l n="23">At last he came .</l>
     <l n="24">O who can tell the greeting</l>
     <l n="25">These greedy lovers had at their first meeting .</l>
     <l n="26">He asked , she gave , and nothing was denied .</l>
     <l n="27">Both to each other quickly were affied .</l>
     <l n="28">Look how their hands , so were their hearts united ,</l>
     <l n="29">And what he did she willingly requited .</l>
     <l n="30">( Sweet are the kisses , the embracements sweet ,</l>
     <l n="31">When like desires and affections meet ,</l>
     <l n="32">For from the earth to heaven is Cupid raised ,</l>
     <l n="33">Where fancy is in equal balance peised . )</l>
     <l n="34">Yet she this rashness suddenly repented</l>
     <l n="35">And turned aside , and to herself lamented</l>
     <l n="36">As if her name and honour had been wronged</l>
     <l n="37">By being possessed of him for whom she longed .</l>
     <l n="38">Ay , and she wished , albeit not from her heart</l>
     <l n="39">That he would leave her turret and depart .</l>
     <l n="40">The mirthful god of amorous pleasure smiled</l>
     <l n="41">To see how he this captive nymph beguiled .</l>
     <l n="42">For hitherto he did but fan the fire ,</l>
     <l n="43">And kept it down that it might mount the higher .</l>
     <l n="44">Now waxed she jealous lest his love abated ,</l>
     <l n="45">Fearing her own thoughts made her to be hated .</l>
     <l n="46">Therefore unto him hastily she goes</l>
     <l n="47">And , like light Salmacis , her body throws</l>
     <l n="48">Upon his bosom where with yielding eyes</l>
     <l n="49">She offers up herself a sacrifice</l>
     <l n="50">To slake his anger if he were displeased .</l>
     <l n="51">O , what god would not therewith be appeased ?</l>
     <l n="52">Like Aesop 's cock this jewel he enjoyed</l>
     <l n="53">And as a brother with his sister toyed</l>
     <l n="54">Supposing nothing else was to be done ,</l>
     <l n="55">Now he her favour and good will had won .</l>
     <l n="56">But know you not that creatures wanting sense</l>
     <l n="57">By nature have a mutual appetence ,</l>
     <l n="58">And , wanting organs to advance a step ,</l>
     <l n="59">Moved by love 's force unto each other lep ?</l>
     <l n="60">Much more in subjects having intellect</l>
     <l n="61">Some hidden influence breeds like effect .</l>
     <l n="62">Albeit Leander rude in love and raw ,</l>
     <l n="63">Long dallying with Hero , nothing saw</l>
     <l n="64">That might delight him more , yet he suspected</l>
     <l n="65">Some amorous rites or other were neglected .</l>
     <l n="66">Therefore unto his body hers he clung .</l>
     <l n="67">She , fearing on the rushes to be flung ,</l>
     <l n="68">Strived with redoubled strength ; the more she strived</l>
     <l n="69">The more a gentle pleasing heat revived ,</l>
     <l n="70">Which taught him all that elder lovers know .</l>
     <l n="71">And now the same gan so to scorch and glow</l>
     <l n="72">As in plain terms ( yet cunningly ) he craved it .</l>
     <l n="73">Love always makes those eloquent that have it .</l>
     <l n="74">She , with a kind of granting , put him by it</l>
     <l n="75">And ever , as he thought himself most nigh it ,</l>
     <l n="76">Like to the tree of Tantalus , she fled</l>
     <l n="77">And , seeming lavish , saved her maidenhead .</l>
     <l n="78">Ne'er king more sought to keep his diadem ,</l>
     <l n="79">Than Hero this inestimable gem .</l>
     <l n="80">Above our life we love a steadfast friend ,</l>
     <l n="81">Yet when a token of great worth we send ,</l>
     <l n="82">We often kiss it , often look thereon ,</l>
     <l n="83">And stay the messenger that would be gone .</l>
     <l n="84">No marvel then , though Hero would not yield</l>
     <l n="85">So soon to part from that she dearly held .</l>
     <l n="86">Jewels being lost are found again , this never ;</l>
     <l n="87">‘ Tis lost but once , and once lost , lost forever .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="88">Now had the morn espied her lover 's steeds ,</l>
     <l n="89">Whereat she starts , puts on her purple weeds ,</l>
     <l n="90">And red for anger that he stayed so long</l>
     <l n="91">All headlong throws herself the clouds among .</l>
     <l n="92">And now Leander , fearing to be missed ,</l>
     <l n="93">Embraced her suddenly , took leave , and kissed .</l>
     <l n="94">Long was he taking leave , and loath to go ,</l>
     <l n="95">And kissed again as lovers use to do .</l>
     <l n="96">Sad Hero wrung him by the hand and wept</l>
     <l n="97">Saying , “ Let your vows and promises be kept . ”</l>
     <l n="98">Then standing at the door she turned about</l>
     <l n="99">As loath to see Leander going out .</l>
     <l n="100">And now the sun that through th ’ horizon peeps ,</l>
     <l n="101">As pitying these lovers , downward creeps ,</l>
     <l n="102">So that in silence of the cloudy night ,</l>
     <l n="103">Though it was morning , did he take his flight .</l>
     <l n="104">But what the secret trusty night concealed</l>
     <l n="105">Leander 's amorous habit soon revealed .</l>
     <l n="106">With Cupid 's myrtle was his bonnet crowned ,</l>
     <l n="107">About his arms the purple riband wound</l>
     <l n="108">Wherewith she wreathed her largely spreading hair .</l>
     <l n="109">Nor could the youth abstain , but he must wear</l>
     <l n="110">The sacred ring wherewith she was endowed</l>
     <l n="111">When first religious chastity she vowed .</l>
     <l n="112">Which made his love through Sestos to be known ,</l>
     <l n="113">And thence unto Abydos sooner blown</l>
     <l n="114">Than he could sail ; for incorporeal fame</l>
     <l n="115">Whose weight consists in nothing but her name ,</l>
     <l n="116">Is swifter than the wind , whose tardy plumes</l>
     <l n="117">Are reeking water and dull earthly fumes .</l>
     <l n="118">Home when he came , he seemed not to be there ,</l>
     <l n="119">But , like exiled air thrust from his sphere ,</l>
     <l n="120">Set in a foreign place ; and straight from thence ,</l>
     <l n="121">Alcides like , by mighty violence</l>
     <l n="122">He would have chased away the swelling main</l>
     <l n="123">That him from her unjustly did detain .</l>
     <l n="124">Like as the sun in a diameter</l>
     <l n="125">Fires and inflames objects removed far ,</l>
     <l n="126">And heateth kindly , shining laterally ,</l>
     <l n="127">So beauty sweetly quickens when ‘ tis nigh ,</l>
     <l n="128">But being separated and removed ,</l>
     <l n="129">Burns where it cherished , murders where it loved .</l>
     <l n="130">Therefore even as an index to a book ,</l>
     <l n="131">So to his mind was young Leander 's look .</l>
     <l n="132">O , none but gods have power their love to hide ,</l>
     <l n="133">Affection by the countenance is descried .</l>
     <l n="134">The light of hidden fire itself discovers ,</l>
     <l n="135">And love that is concealed betrays poor lovers ,</l>
     <l n="136">His secret flame apparently was seen .</l>
     <l n="137">Leander 's father knew where he had been</l>
     <l n="138">And for the same mildly rebuked his son ,</l>
     <l n="139">Thinking to quench the sparkles new begun .</l>
     <l n="140">But love resisted once grows passionate ,</l>
     <l n="141">And nothing more than counsel lovers hate .</l>
     <l n="142">For as a hot proud horse highly disdains</l>
     <l n="143">To have his head controlled , but breaks the reins ,</l>
     <l n="144">Spits forth the ringled bit , and with his hooves</l>
     <l n="145">Checks the submissive ground ; so he that loves ,</l>
     <l n="146">The more he is restrained , the worse he fares .</l>
     <l n="147">What is it now , but mad Leander dares ?</l>
     <l n="148">“ O Hero , Hero ! ” thus he cried full oft ;</l>
     <l n="149">And then he got him to a rock aloft ,</l>
     <l n="150">Where having spied her tower , long stared he o n't ,</l>
     <l n="151">And prayed the narrow toiling Hellespont</l>
     <l n="152">To part in twain , that he might come and go ;</l>
     <l n="153">But still the rising billows answered , “ No . ”</l>
     <l n="154">With that he stripped him to the ivory skin</l>
     <l n="155">And , crying “ Love , I come , ” leaped lively in .</l>
     <l n="156">Whereat the sapphire visaged god grew proud ,</l>
     <l n="157">And made his capering Triton sound aloud ,</l>
     <l n="158">Imagining that Ganymede , displeased ,</l>
     <l n="159">Had left the heavens ; therefore on him he seized .</l>
     <l n="160">Leander strived ; the waves about him wound ,</l>
     <l n="161">And pulled him to the bottom , where the ground</l>
     <l n="162">Was strewed with pearl , and in low coral groves</l>
     <l n="163">Sweet singing mermaids sported with their loves</l>
     <l n="164">On heaps of heavy gold , and took great pleasure</l>
     <l n="165">To spurn in careless sort the shipwrack treasure .</l>
     <l n="166">For here the stately azure palace stood</l>
     <l n="167">Where kingly Neptune and his train abode .</l>
     <l n="168">The lusty god embraced him , called him “ Love , ”</l>
     <l n="169">And swore he never should return to Jove .</l>
     <l n="170">But when he knew it was not Ganymede ,</l>
     <l n="171">For under water he was almost dead ,</l>
     <l n="172">He heaved him up and , looking on his face ,</l>
     <l n="173">Beat down the bold waves with his triple mace ,</l>
     <l n="174">Which mounted up , intending to have kissed him ,</l>
     <l n="175">And fell in drops like tears because they missed him .</l>
     <l n="176">Leander , being up , began to swim</l>
     <l n="177">And , looking back , saw Neptune follow him ,</l>
     <l n="178">Whereat aghast , the poor soul ‘ gan to cry</l>
     <l n="179">“ O , let me visit Hero ere I die ! ”</l>
     <l n="180">The god put Helle 's bracelet on his arm ,</l>
     <l n="181">And swore the sea should never do him harm .</l>
     <l n="182">He clapped his plump cheeks , with his tresses played</l>
     <l n="183">And , smiling wantonly , his love bewrayed .</l>
     <l n="184">He watched his arms and , as they opened wide</l>
     <l n="185">At every stroke , betwixt them would he slide</l>
     <l n="186">And steal a kiss , and then run out and dance ,</l>
     <l n="187">And , as he turned , cast many a lustful glance ,</l>
     <l n="188">And threw him gaudy toys to please his eye ,</l>
     <l n="189">And dive into the water , and there pry</l>
     <l n="190">Upon his breast , his thighs , and every limb ,</l>
     <l n="191">And up again , and close beside him swim ,</l>
     <l n="192">And talk of love .</l>
     <l n="193">Leander made reply ,</l>
     <l n="194">“ You are deceived ; I am no woman , I . ”</l>
     <l n="195">Thereat smiled Neptune , and then told a tale ,</l>
     <l n="196">How that a shepherd , sitting in a vale ,</l>
     <l n="197">Played with a boy so fair and kind ,</l>
     <l n="198">As for his love both earth and heaven pined ;</l>
     <l n="199">That of the cooling river durst not drink ,</l>
     <l n="200">Lest water nymphs should pull him from the brink .</l>
     <l n="201">And when he sported in the fragrant lawns ,</l>
     <l n="202">Goat footed satyrs and upstaring fauns</l>
     <l n="203">Would steal him thence . Ere half this tale was done ,</l>
     <l n="204">“ Ay me , ” Leander cried , “ th ’ enamoured sun</l>
     <l n="205">That now should shine on Thetis ’ glassy bower ,</l>
     <l n="206">Descends upon my radiant Hero 's tower .</l>
     <l n="207">O , that these tardy arms of mine were wings ! ”</l>
     <l n="208">And , as he spake , upon the waves he springs .</l>
     <l n="209">Neptune was angry that he gave no ear ,</l>
     <l n="210">And in his heart revenging malice bare .</l>
     <l n="211">He flung at him his mace but , as it went ,</l>
     <l n="212">He called it in , for love made him repent .</l>
     <l n="213">The mace , returning back , his own hand hit</l>
     <l n="214">As meaning to be venged for darting it .</l>
     <l n="215">When this fresh bleeding wound Leander viewed ,</l>
     <l n="216">His colour went and came , as if he rued</l>
     <l n="217">The grief which Neptune felt . In gentle breasts</l>
     <l n="218">Relenting thoughts , remorse , and pity rests .</l>
     <l n="219">And who have hard hearts and obdurate minds ,</l>
     <l n="220">But vicious , harebrained , and illiterate hinds ?</l>
     <l n="221">The god , seeing him with pity to be moved ,</l>
     <l n="222">Thereon concluded that he was beloved .</l>
     <l n="223">( Love is too full of faith , too credulous ,</l>
     <l n="224">With folly and false hope deluding us . )</l>
     <l n="225">Wherefore , Leander 's fancy to surprise ,</l>
     <l n="226">To the rich Ocean for gifts he flies .</l>
     <l n="227">‘ tis wisdom to give much ; a gift prevails</l>
     <l n="228">When deep persuading oratory fails .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="229">By this Leander , being near the land ,</l>
     <l n="230">Cast down his weary feet and felt the sand .</l>
     <l n="231">Breathless albeit he were he rested not</l>
     <l n="232">Till to the solitary tower he got ,</l>
     <l n="233">And knocked and called . At which celestial noise</l>
     <l n="234">The longing heart of Hero much more joys</l>
     <l n="235">Than nymphs and shepherds when the timbrel rings ,</l>
     <l n="236">Or crooked dolphin when the sailor sings .</l>
     <l n="237">She stayed not for her robes but straight arose</l>
     <l n="238">And , drunk with gladness , to the door she goes ,</l>
     <l n="239">Where seeing a naked man , she screeched for fear</l>
     <l n="240">( Such sights as this to tender maids are rare )</l>
     <l n="241">And ran into the dark herself to hide .</l>
     <l n="242">( Rich jewels in the dark are soonest spied ) .</l>
     <l n="243">Unto her was he led , or rather drawn</l>
     <l n="244">By those white limbs which sparkled through the lawn .</l>
     <l n="245">The nearer that he came , the more she fled ,</l>
     <l n="246">And , seeking refuge , slipped into her bed .</l>
     <l n="247">Whereon Leander sitting thus began ,</l>
     <l n="248">Through numbing cold , all feeble , faint , and wan .</l>
     <l n="249">“ If not for love , yet , love , for pity sake ,</l>
     <l n="250">Me in thy bed and maiden bosom take .</l>
     <l n="251">At least vouchsafe these arms some little room ,</l>
     <l n="252">Who , hoping to embrace thee , cheerly swum .</l>
     <l n="253">This head was beat with many a churlish billow ,</l>
     <l n="254">And therefore let it rest upon thy pillow . ”</l>
     <l n="255">Herewith affrighted , Hero shrunk away ,</l>
     <l n="256">And in her lukewarm place Leander lay ,</l>
     <l n="257">Whose lively heat , like fire from heaven fet ,</l>
     <l n="258">Would animate gross clay and higher set</l>
     <l n="259">The drooping thoughts of base declining souls</l>
     <l n="260">Than dreary Mars carousing nectar bowls .</l>
     <l n="261">His hands he cast upon her like a snare .</l>
     <l n="262">She , overcome with shame and sallow fear ,</l>
     <l n="263">Like chaste Diana when Actaeon spied her ,</l>
     <l n="264">Being suddenly betrayed , dived down to hide her .</l>
     <l n="265">And , as her silver body downward went ,</l>
     <l n="266">With both her hands she made the bed a tent ,</l>
     <l n="267">And in her own mind thought herself secure ,</l>
     <l n="268">O'ercast with dim and darksome coverture .</l>
     <l n="269">And now she lets him whisper in her ear ,</l>
     <l n="270">Flatter , entreat , promise , protest and swear ;</l>
     <l n="271">Yet ever , as he greedily assayed</l>
     <l n="272">To touch those dainties , she the harpy played ,</l>
     <l n="273">And every limb did , as a soldier stout ,</l>
     <l n="274">Defend the fort , and keep the foeman out .</l>
     <l n="275">For though the rising ivory mount he scaled ,</l>
     <l n="276">Which is with azure circling lines empaled ,</l>
     <l n="277">Much like a globe ( a globe may I term this ,</l>
     <l n="278">By which love sails to regions full of bliss )</l>
     <l n="279">Yet there with Sisyphus he toiled in vain ,</l>
     <l n="280">Till gentle parley did the truce obtain .</l>
     <l n="281">Wherein Leander on her quivering breast</l>
     <l n="282">Breathless spoke something , and sighed out the rest ;</l>
     <l n="283">Which so prevailed , as he with small ado</l>
     <l n="284">Enclosed her in his arms and kissed her too .</l>
     <l n="285">And every kiss to her was as a charm ,</l>
     <l n="286">And to Leander as a fresh alarm ,</l>
     <l n="287">So that the truce was broke and she , alas ,</l>
     <l n="288">( Poor silly maiden ) at his mercy was .</l>
     <l n="289">Love is not full of pity ( as men say )</l>
     <l n="290">But deaf and cruel where he means to prey .</l>
     <l n="291">Even as a bird , which in our hands we wring ,</l>
     <l n="292">Forth plungeth and oft flutters with her wing ,</l>
     <l n="293">She trembling strove .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="294">This strife of hers ( like that</l>
     <l n="295">Which made the world ) another world begat</l>
     <l n="296">Of unknown joy . Treason was in her thought ,</l>
     <l n="297">And cunningly to yield herself she sought .</l>
     <l n="298">Seeming not won , yet won she was at length .</l>
     <l n="299">In such wars women use but half their strength .</l>
     <l n="300">Leander now , like Theban Hercules ,</l>
     <l n="301">Entered the orchard of th ’ Hesperides ;</l>
     <l n="302">Whose fruit none rightly can describe but he</l>
     <l n="303">That pulls or shakes it from the golden tree .</l>
     <l n="304">And now she wished this night were never done ,</l>
     <l n="305">And sighed to think upon th ’ approaching sun ;</l>
     <l n="306">For much it grieved her that the bright daylight</l>
     <l n="307">Should know the pleasure of this blessed night ,</l>
     <l n="308">And them , like Mars and Erycine , display</l>
     <l n="309">Both in each other 's arms chained as they lay .</l>
     <l n="310">Again , she knew not how to frame her look ,</l>
     <l n="311">Or speak to him , who in a moment took</l>
     <l n="312">That which so long so charily she kept ,</l>
     <l n="313">And fain by stealth away she would have crept ,</l>
     <l n="314">And to some corner secretly have gone ,</l>
     <l n="315">Leaving Leander in the bed alone .</l>
     <l n="316">But as her naked feet were whipping out ,</l>
     <l n="317">He on the sudden clinged her so about ,</l>
     <l n="318">That , mermaid-like , unto the floor she slid .</l>
     <l n="319">One half appeared , the other half was hid .</l>
     <l n="320">Thus near the bed she blushing stood upright ,</l>
     <l n="321">And from her countenance behold ye might</l>
     <l n="322">A kind of twilight break , which through the hair ,</l>
     <l n="323">As from an orient cloud , glimpsed here and there ,</l>
     <l n="324">And round about the chamber this false morn</l>
     <l n="325">Brought forth the day before the day was born .</l>
     <l n="326">So Hero 's ruddy cheek Hero betrayed ,</l>
     <l n="327">And her all naked to his sight displayed ,</l>
     <l n="328">Whence his admiring eyes more pleasure took</l>
     <l n="329">Than Dis , on heaps of gold fixing his look .</l>
     <l n="330">By this , Apollo 's golden harp began</l>
     <l n="331">To sound forth music to the ocean ,</l>
     <l n="332">Which watchful Hesperus no sooner heard</l>
     <l n="333">But he the bright day-bearing car prepared</l>
     <l n="334">And ran before , as harbinger of light ,</l>
     <l n="335">And with his flaring beams mocked ugly night ,</l>
     <l n="336">Till she , o'ercome with anguish , shame , and rage ,</l>
     <l n="337">Danged down to hell her loathsome carriage .</l>
