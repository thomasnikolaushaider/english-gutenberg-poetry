    <head>ACT I .</head>
     <l n="1">SCENE I. London . A Street .</l>
   </lg>
   <note>Enter , at one end , John Lincoln , with the two Bettses together ; at the other end , enters Francis de Barde and Doll a lusty woman , he haling her by the arm .</note>
   <p>DOLL . Whether wilt thou hale me ?</p>
   <p>BARDE . Whether I please ; thou art my prize , and I plead purchase of thee .</p>
   <p>DOLL . Purchase of me ! away , ye rascal ! I am an honest plain carpenters wife , and though I have no beauty to like a husband , yet whatsoever is mine scorns to stoop to a stranger : hand off , then , when I bid thee !</p>
   <p>BARDE . Go with me quietly , or I 'll compel thee .</p>
   <p>DOLL . Compel me , ye dog 's face ! thou thinkst thou hast the goldsmith 's wife in hand , whom thou enticedst from her husband with all his plate , and when thou turndst her home to him again , madst him , like an ass , pay for his wife 's board .</p>
   <p>BARDE . So will I make thy husband too , if please me .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">[ Enter Caveler with a pair of doves ; Williamson the carpenter , and</l>

     <l n="5">CAVELER .</l>
     <l n="6">Follow me no further ; I say thou shalt not have them .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="7">WILLIAMSON .</l>
     <l n="8">I bought them in Cheapside , and paid my money for them .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>SHERWIN . He did , sir , indeed ; and you offer him wrong , both to take them from him , and not restore him his money neither .</p>
   <p>CAVELER . If he paid for them , let it suffice that I possess them : beefs and brews may serve such hinds ; are pigeons meat for a coarse carpenter ?</p>
   <p>LINCOLN . It is hard when Englishmen 's patience must be thus jetted on by strangers , and they not dare to revenge their own wrongs .</p>
   <p>GEORGE . Lincoln , let 's beat them down , and bear no more of these abuses .</p>
   <p>LINCOLN . We may not , Betts : be patient , and hear more .</p>
   <p>DOLL . How now , husband ! what , one stranger take they food from thee , and another thy wife ! by our Lady , flesh and blood , I think , can hardly brook that .</p>
   <p>LINCOLN . Will this gear never be otherwise ? must these wrongs be thus endured ?</p>
   <p>GEORGE . Let us step in , and help to revenge their injury .</p>
   <p>BARDE . What art thou that talkest of revenge ? my lord ambassador shall once more make your Major have a check , if he punish thee for this saucy presumption .</p>
   <p>WILLIAMSON . Indeed , my lord Mayor , on the ambassador 's complaint , sent me to Newgate one day , because ( against my will ) I took the wall of a stranger : you may do any thing ; the goldsmith 's wife and mine now must be at your commandment .</p>
   <p>GEORGE . The more patient fools are ye both , to suffer it .</p>
   <p>BARDE . Suffer it ! mend it thou or he , if ye can or dare . I tell thee , fellows , and she were the Mayor of London 's wife , had I her once in my possession , I would keep her in spite of him that durst say nay .</p>
   <p>GEORGE . I tell thee , Lombard , these words should cost thy best cape , were I not curbed by duty and obedience : the Mayor of London 's wife ! Oh God , shall it be thus ?</p>
   <p>DOLL . Why , Betts , am not I as dear t m husband as my lord Mayor 's wife to him ? and wilt thou so neglectly suffer thine own shame ?— Hands off , proud stranger ! or , by him that bought me , if men 's milky hearts dare not strike a stranger , yet women beat them down , ere they bear these abuses .</p>
   <p>BARDE . Mistress , I say you shall along with me .</p>
   <p>DOLL . Touch not Doll Williamson , least she lay thee along on God 's dear earth .— And you , sir [ To Caveler ] , that allow such coarse cates to carpenters , whilst pigeons , which they pay for , must serve your dainty appetite , deliver them back to my husband again , or I 'll call so many women to mine assistance as will not leave one inch untorn of thee : if our husbands must be bridled by law , and forced to bear your wrongs , their wives will be a little lawless , and soundly beat ye .</p>
   <p>CAVELER . Come away , De Barde , and let us go complain to my lord ambassador .</p>
   <note>Exeunt Ambo .</note>
   <p>DOLL . Aye , go , and send him among us , and we 'll give him his welcome too .— I am ashamed that freeborn Englishmen , having beaten strangers within their own homes , should thus be braved and abused by them at home .</p>
   <p>SHERWIN . It is not our lack of courage in the cause , but the strict obedience that we are bound to . I am the goldsmith whose wrongs you talked of ; but how to redress yours or mine own is a matter beyond our abilities .</p>
   <p>LINCOLN . Not so , not so , my good friends : I , though a mean man , a broker by profession , and named John Lincoln , have long time winked at these wild enormities with mighty impatience , and , as these two brethren here ( Betts by name ) can witness , with loss of mine own life would gladly remedy them .</p>
   <p>GEORGE . And he is in a good forwardness , I tell ye , if all hit right .</p>
   <p>DOLL . As how , I prithee ? tell it to Doll Williamson .</p>
   <p>LINCOLN . You know the Spittle sermons begin the next week : I have drawn a bill of our wrongs and the strangers ’ insolences .</p>
   <p>GEORGE . Which he means the preachers shall there openly publish in the pulpit .</p>
   <p>WILLIAMSON . Oh , but that they would ! yfaith , it would tickle our strangers thoroughly .</p>
   <p>DOLL . Aye , and if you men durst not undertake it , before God , we women would . Take an honest woman from her husband ! why , it is intolerable .</p>
   <p>SHERWIN . But how find ye the preachers affected to our proceeding ?</p>
   <p>LINCOLN . Master Doctor Standish hath answered that it becomes not him to move any such thing in his sermon , and tells us we must move the Mayor and aldermen to reform it , and doubts not but happy success will ensue on statement of our wrongs . You shall perceive there 's no hurt in the bill : here 's a couple of it ; I pray ye , hear it .</p>
   <p>ALL . With all our hearts ; for God 's sake , read it .</p>
   <p>LINCOLN . [ Reads . ] To you all , the worshipful lords and masters of this city , that will take compassion over the poor people your neighbors , and also of the great importable hurts , losses , and hinderances , whereof proceedeth extreme poverty to all the king 's subjects that inhabit within this city and suburbs of the same : for so it is that aliens and strangers eat the bread from the fatherless children , and take the living from all the artificers and the intercourse from all the merchants , whereby poverty is so much increased , that every man bewaileth the misery of other ; for craftsmen be brought to beggary , and merchants to neediness : wherefore , the premises considered , the redress must be of the common knit and united to one part : and as the hurt and damage grieveth all men , so must all men see to their willing power for remedy , and not suffer the said aliens in their wealth , and the natural born men of this region to come to confusion .</p>
   <p>DOLL . Before God , tis excellent ; and I 'll maintain the suit to be honest .</p>
   <p>SHERWIN . Well , say tis read , what is your further meaning in the matter ?</p>
   <p>GEORGE . What ! marry , list to me . No doubt but this will store us with friends enow , whose names we will closely keep in writing ; and on May day next in the morning we 'll go forth a Maying , but make it the worst May day for the strangers that ever they saw . How say ye ? do ye subscribe , or are ye faint-hearted revolters ?</p>
   <p>DOLL . Hold thee , George Betts , there 's my hand and my heart : by the Lord , I 'll make a captain among ye , and do somewhat to be talk of for ever after .</p>
   <p>WILLIAMSON . My masters , ere we part , let 's friendly go and drink together , and swear true secrecy upon our lives .</p>
   <p>GEORGE . There spake an angel . Come , let us along , then .</p>
   <note>Exeunt .</note>
   <p>SCENE II . London . The Sessions House .</p>
   <note>An arras is drawn , and behind it as in sessions sit the Lord Mayor , Justice Suresby , and other Justices ; Sheriff More and the other Sheriff sitting by . Smart is the plaintiff , Lifter the prisoner at the bar . Recorder , Officers .</note>
   <p>LORD MAYOR . Having dispatched our weightier businesses , We may give ear to petty felonies . Master Sheriff More , what is this fellow ?</p>
   <p>MORE . My lord , he stands indicted for a purse ; He hath been tried , the jury is together .</p>
   <p>LORD MAYOR . Who sent him in ?</p>
   <p>SURESBY . That did I , my lord : Had he had right , he had been hanged ere this ; The only captain of the cutpurse crew .</p>
   <p>LORD MAYOR . What is his name ?</p>
   <p>SURESBY . As his profession is , Lifter , my lord , One that can lift a purse right cunningly .</p>
   <p>LORD MAYOR . And is that he accuses him ?</p>
   <p>SURESBY . The same , my lord , whom , by your honors leave , I must say somewhat too , because I find In some respects he is well worthy blame .</p>
   <p>LORD MAYOR . Good Master Justice Suresby , speak your mind ; We are well pleased to give you audience .</p>
   <p>SURESBY . Hear me , Smart ; thou art a foolish fellow : If Lifter be convicted by the law , As I see not how the jury can acquit him , I 'll stand too ‘ t thou art guilty of his death .</p>
   <p>MORE . My lord , that 's worthy the hearing .</p>
   <p>LORD MAYOR . Listen , then , good Master More .</p>
   <p>SURESBY . I tell thee plain , it is a shame for thee , With such a sum to tempt necessity ; No less than ten pounds , sir , will serve your turn , To carry in your purse about with ye , To crake and brag in taverns of your money : I promise ye , a man that goes abroad With an intent of truth , meeting such a booty , May be provoked to that he never meant . What makes so many pilferers and felons , But such fond baits that foolish people lay To tempt the needy miserable wretch ? Ten pounds , odd money ; this is a pretty sum To bear about , which were more safe at home . Fore God , twere well to fine ye as much more</p>

     <l n="1">To the relief of the poor prisoners ,</l>

     <l n="4">If ye had lost as much as twice ten pounds .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>MORE . Good my lord , sooth a point or two for once , Only to try conclusions in this case .</p>
   <p>LORD MAYOR . Content , good Master More : we 'll rise awhile , And , till the jury can return their verdict , Walk in the garden .— How say ye , Justices ?</p>
   <p>ALL . We like it well , my lord ; we 'll follow ye .</p>

   <p>MORE . Sirrah , you know that you are known to me , And I have often saved ye from this place , Since first I came in office : thou seest beside , That Justice Suresby is thy heavy friend , By all the blame that he pretends to Smart , For tempting thee with such a sum of money . I tell thee what ; devise me but a means To pick or cut his purse , and , on my credit , And as I am a Christian and a man , I will procure they pardon for that jest .</p>
   <p>LIFTER . Good Master Shrieve , seek not my overthrow : You know , sir , I have many heavy friends , And more indictments like to come upon me . You are too deep for me to deal withal ; You are known to be one of the wisest men That is in England : I pray ye , Master Sheriff , Go not about to undermine my life .</p>
   <p>MORE . Lifter , I am true subject to my king ; Thou much mistake me : and , for thou shall not think I mean by this to hurt thy life at all , I will maintain the act when thou hast done it . Thou knowest there are such matters in my hands , As if I pleased to give them to the jury , I should not need this way to circumvent thee . All that I aim at is a merry jest : Perform it , Lifter , and expect my best .</p>
   <p>LIFTER . I thank your worship : God preserve your life ! But Master Justice Suresby is gone in ; I know not how to come near where he is .</p>
   <p>MORE . Let me alone for that ; I 'll be thy setter ; I 'll send him hither to thee presently , Under the colour of thine own request , Of private matters to acquaint him with .</p>
   <p>LIFTER . If ye do so , sir , then let me alone ; Forty to one but then his purse is gone .</p>
   <p>MORE . Well said : but see that thou diminish not One penny of the money , but give it me ; It is the cunning act that credits thee .</p>
   <p>LIFTER . I will , good Master Sheriff , I assure ye .</p>

   <p>SURESBY . Sir , sir , ye are indeed , with more than 's true , For you are flatly charged with felony ; You 're charged with more than truth , and that is theft ; More than a true man should be charged withal ; Thou art a varlet , that 's no more than true .

   <p>SURESBY . Sure , Master Shrieve ! as sure as you are there , And in it seven pounds , odd money , on my faith .</p>
   <p>MORE . Seven pounds , odd money ! what , were you so mad , Being a wise man and a magistrate , To trust your purse with such a liberal sum ? Seven pounds , odd money ! fore God , it is a shame , With such a sum to tempt necessity : I promise ye , a man that goes abroad With an intent of truth , meeting such a booty , May be wrought to that he never thought . What makes so many pilferers and felons , But these fond baits that foolish people lay To tempt the needy miserable wretch ? Should he be taken now that has your purse , I 'd stand to't , you are guilty of his death ; For , questionless , he would be cast by law . Twere a good deed to fine ye as much more , To the relief of the poor prisoners , To teach ye lock your money up at home .</p>
   <p>SURESBY . Well , Master More , you are a merry man ; I find ye , sir , I find ye well enough .</p>
   <p>MORE . Nay , ye shall see , sir , trusting thus your money , And Lifter here in trial for like case , But that the poor man is a prisoner , It would be now suspected that he had it . Thus may ye see what mischief often comes By the fond carriage of such needless sums .</p>
   <p>LORD MAYOR . Believe me , Master Suresby , this is strange , You , being a man so settled in assurance , Will fall in that which you condemned in other .</p>
   <p>MORE . Well , Master Suresby , there 's your purse again , And all your money : fear nothing of More ; Wisdom still keeps the mean and locks the door .</p>
   <p>SCENE III . London . A state apartment .</p>
   <note>Enter the Earls of Shrewsbury and Surrey , Sir Thomas Palmer , and Sir Roger Cholmley .</note>
   <p>SHREWSBURY . My lord of Surrey , and Sir Thomas Palmer Might I with patience tempt your grave advise , I tell ye true , that in these dangerous times I do not like this frowning vulgar brow : My searching eye did never entertain A more distracted countenance of grief Than I have late observed In the displeased commons of the city .</p>
   <p>SURREY . Tis strange that from his princely clemency , So well a tempered mercy and a grace , To all the aliens in this fruitful land , That this high-crested insolence should spring From them that breathe from his majestic bounty , That , fattened with the traffic of our country , Already leaps into his subject 's face .</p>
   <p>PALMER . Yet Sherwin , hindered to commence his suit Against De Barde by the ambassador , By supplication made unto the king , Who having first enticed away his wife , And got his plate , near worth four hundred pound , To grieve some wronged citizens that found This vile disgrace oft cast into their teeth , Of late sues Sherwin , and arrested him For money for the boarding of his wife .</p>
   <p>SURREY . The more knave Barde , that , using Sherwin 's goods , Doth ask him interest for the occupation . I like not that , my lord of Shrewsbury : He 's ill bested that lends a well paced horse Unto a man that will not find him meet .</p>
   <p>CHOLMLEY . My lord of Surrey will be pleasant still .</p>
   <p>PALMER . Aye , being then employed by your honors To stay the broil that fell about the same , Where by persuasion I enforced the wrongs , And urged the grief of the displeased city , He answered me , and with a solemn oath , That , if he had the Mayor of London 's wife , He would keep her in despite of any English .</p>
   <p>SURREY . Tis good , Sir Thomas , then , for you and me ; Your wife is dead , and I a bachelor : If no man can possess his wife alone , I am glad , Sir Thomas Palmer , I have none .</p>
   <p>CHOLMLEY . If a take a wife , a shall find her meet .</p>
   <p>SURREY . And reason good , Sir Roger Cholmley , too . If these hot Frenchmen needsly will have sport , They should in kindness yet defray the charge : Tis hard when men possess our wives in quiet , And yet leave us in , to discharge their diet .</p>
   <p>SHREWSBURY . My lord , our catours shall not use the market For our provision , but some stranger now Will take the vittailes from him he hath bought : A carpenter , as I was late informed , Who having bought a pair of doves in Cheap , Immediately a Frenchman took them from him , And beat the poor man for resisting him ; And when the fellow did complain his wrongs , He was severely punished for his labor .</p>
   <p>SURREY . But if the English blood be once but up , As I perceive their hearts already full , I fear me much , before their spleens be cold , Some of these saucy aliens for their pride Will pay for ‘ t soundly , wheresoere it lights : This tide of rage that with the eddy strives , I fear me much , will drown too many lives .</p>
   <p>CHOLMLEY . Now , afore God , your honors , pardon me : Men of your place and greatness are to blame . I tell ye true , my lords , in that his majesty Is not informed of this base abuse And daily wrongs are offered to his subjects ; For , if he were , I know his gracious wisdom Would soon redress it .</p>
   <note>Enter a Messenger .</note>
   <p>SHREWSBURY . Sirrah , what news ?</p>
   <p>CHOLMLEY . None good , I fear .</p>
   <p>MESSENGER . My lord , ill news ; and worse , I fear , will follow , If speedily it be not looked unto : The city is in an uproar , and the Mayor Is threatened , if he come out of his house . A number poor artificers are up In arms and threaten to avenge their wrongs .</p>
   <p>CHOLMLEY . We feared what this would come unto : This follows on the doctors publishing The bill of wrongs in public at the Spittle .</p>
   <p>SHREWSBURY . That Doctor Beale may chance beshrew himself For reading of the bill .</p>
   <p>PALMER . Let us go gather forces to the Mayor , For quick suppressing this rebellious route .</p>
   <p>SURREY . Now I bethink myself of Master More , One of the sheriffs , a wise and learned gentleman , And in especial favour with the people : He , backed with other grave and sober men , May by his gentle and persuasive speech Perhaps prevail more than we can with power .</p>
   <p>SHREWSBURY . Believe me , but your honor well advises : Let us make haste ; for I do greatly fear Some of their graves this morning 's work will bear .</p>

    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>HARRY . Come , lay down the cudgels . Ho , Robin , you met us well at Bunhill , to have you with us a Maying this morning .</p>
   <p>ROBIN . Faith , Harry , the head drawer at the Miter by the great Conduit called me up , and we went to breakfast into St. Anne lane . But come , who begins ? in good faith , I am clean out of practise . When wast at Garrets school , Harry ?</p>
   <p>HARRY . Not this great while , never since I brake his ushers head , when he played his scholars prize at the Star in Bread-street . I use all to George Philpots at Dowgate ; he 's the best backswordman in England .</p>
   <p>KIT . Bate me an ace of that , quoth Bolton .</p>
   <p>HARRY . I 'll not bate ye a pin on ‘ t , sir ; for , by this cudgel , tis true .</p>
   <p>KIT . I will cudgel that opinion out of ye : did you break an ushers head , sir ?</p>
   <p>HARRY . Aye , marry , did I , sir .</p>
   <p>KIT . I am very glad on ‘ t : you shall break mine too , and ye can .</p>
   <p>HARRY . Sirrah , I prithee , what art thou ?</p>
   <p>KIT . Why , I am a prentice as thou art ; seest thou now ? I 'll play with thee at blunt here in Cheapside , and when thou hast done , if thou beest angry , I 'll fight with thee at sharp in Moore fields . I have a sword to serve my turn in a favor . . . . come Julie , to serve . . . .</p>
   <p>SCENE II . Saint Martins-le-Grand .</p>
   <note>Enter Lincoln , two Bettses , Williamson , Sherwin , and other , armed ; Doll in a shirt of mail , a headpiece , sword , and buckler ; a crew attending .</note>
   <p>CLOWN . Come , come ; we 'll tickle their turnips , we 'll butter their boxes . Shall strangers rule the roost ? yes ; but we 'll baste the roost . Come , come ; a flaunt , a flaunt !</p>
   <p>GEORGE . Brother , give place , and hear John Lincoln speak .</p>
   <p>CLOWN . Aye , Lincoln my leader , And Doll my true breeder , With the rest of our crew , Shall ran tan tarra ran ; Do all they what they can . Shall we be bobbed , braved ? no : Shall we be held under ? no ; We are freeborne , And do take scorn To be used so .</p>
   <p>DOLL . Peace there , I say ! hear Captain Lincoln speak ; keep silence , till we know his mind at large .</p>
   <p>CLOWN . Then largely deliver ; speak , bully : and he that presumes to interrupt thee in thy oration , this for him .</p>
   <p>LINCOLN . Then , gallant bloods , you whose free souls do scorn To bear the inforced wrongs of aliens , Add rage to resolution , fire the houses Of these audacious strangers . This is St. Martins , And yonder dwells Mutas , a wealthy Piccardy , At the Green Gate , De Barde , Peter Van Hollocke , Adrian Martine , With many more outlandish fugitives . Shall these enjoy more privilege than we In our own country ? let 's , then , become their slaves . Since justice keeps not them in greater awe , We be ourselves rough ministers at law .</p>
   <p>CLOWN . Use no more swords , nor no more words , but fire the houses ; brave captain courageous , fire me their houses .</p>
   <p>DOLL . Aye , for we may as well make bonfires on May day as at midsummer : we 'll alter the day in the calendar , and set it down in flaming letters .</p>
   <p>SHERWIN . Stay ! No , that would much endanger the whole city , Whereto I would not the least prejudice .</p>
   <p>DOLL . No , nor I neither ; so may mine own house be burned for company . I 'll tell ye what : we 'll drag the strangers into More fields , and there bombast them till they stink again .</p>
   <p>CLOWN . And that 's soon done ; for they smell for fear already .</p>
   <p>GEORGE . Let some of us enter the strangers ’ houses , And , if we find them there , then bring them forth .</p>
   <p>DOLL . But if ye bring them forth ere ye find them , I 'll ne'er allow of that .</p>
   <p>CLOWN . Now , Mars , for thy honor , Dutch or French , So it be a wench , I 'll upon her .</p>
   <note>Exeunt some and Sherwin .</note>
   <p>WILLIAMSON . Now , lads , sure shall we labor in our safety . I hear the Mayor hath gathered men in arms , And that Shreeve More an hour ago rised Some of the Privy Counsel in at Ludgate : Force now must make our peace , or else we fall ; ‘ Twill soon be known we are the principal .</p>
   <p>DOLL . And what of that ? if thou beest afraid , husband , go home again , and hide they head ; for , by the Lord , I 'll have a little sport , now we are at it .</p>
   <p>GEORGE . Let 's stand upon our swords , and , if they come , Receive them as they were our enemies .</p>

   <p>CLOWN . A purchase , a purchase ! we have found , we ha found —</p>
   <p>DOLL . What ?</p>
   <p>CLOWN . Nothing ; not a French Fleming nor a Fleming French to be found ; but all fled , in plain English .</p>
   <p>LINCOLN . How now ! have you found any ?</p>
   <p>SHERWIN . No , not one ; they 're all fled .</p>
   <p>LINCOLN . Then fire the houses , that , the Mayor being busy About the quenching of them , we may escape ; Burn down their kennels : let us straight away , Least this day prove to us an ill May day .</p>
   <p>CLOWN . Fire , fire ! I 'll be the first : If hanging come , tis welcome ; that 's the worst .</p>
   <note>Exeunt .</note>
   <p>SCENE III . The Guildhall .</p>
   <note>Enter at one door Sir Thomas More and Lord Mayor ; at another door Sir John Munday hurt .</note>
   <p>LORD MAYOR . What , Sir John Munday , are you hurt ?</p>
   <p>SIR JOHN . A little knock , my lord . There was even now A sort of prentices playing at cudgels ; I did command them to their masters ’ houses ; But now , I fear me , they are gone to join With Lincoln , Sherwin , and their dangerous train .</p>
   <p>MORE . The captains of this insurrection Have taken themselves to arms , and came but now To both the Counters , where they have released Sundry indebted prisoners , and from thence I hear that they are gone into St. Martins , Where they intend to offer violence To the amazed Lombards : therefore , my lord , If we expect the safety of the city , Tis time that force or parley do encounter With these displeased men .</p>
   <note>Enter a Messenger .</note>
   <p>LORD MAYOR . How now ! what news ?</p>
   <p>MESSENGER . My lord , the rebels have broke open Newgate , From whence they have delivered many prisoners , Both felons and notorious murderers , That desperately cleave to their lawless train .</p>
   <p>LORD MAYOR . Up with the drawbridge , gather some forces To Cornhill and Cheapside :— and , gentlemen , If diligence be weighed on every side , A quiet ebb will follow this rough tide .</p>
   <note>Enter Shrewsbury , Surrey , Palmer , and Cholmley .</note>
   <p>SHREWSBURY . Lord Mayor , his majesty , receiving notice Of this most dangerous insurrection , Hath sent my lord of Surrey and myself , Sir Thomas Palmer and our followers , To add unto your forces our best means For pacifying of this mutiny . In God 's name , then , set on with happy speed ! The king laments , if one true subject bleed .</p>
   <p>SURREY . I hear they mean to fire the Lombards ’ houses : Oh power , what art thou in a madman 's eyes ! Thou makest the plodding idiot bloody-wise .</p>
   <p>MORE . My lords , I doubt not but we shall appease With a calm breath this flux of discontent : To call them to a parley , questionless —</p>
   <p>PALMER . May fall out good : tis well said , Master More .</p>
   <p>MORE . Let 's to these simple men ; for many sweat Under this act , that knows not the law 's debt Which hangs upon their lives ; for silly men Plod on they know not how , like a fool 's pen , That , ending , shows not any sentence writ , Linked but to common reason or slightest wit : These follow for no harm ; but yet incur Self penalty with those that raised this stir . A God 's name , on , to calm our private foes With breath of gravity , not dangerous blows !</p>
   <p>SCENE IV . St. Martin 's Gate .</p>
   <note>Enter Lincoln , Doll , Clown , George Betts , Williamson , others ; and a Sergeant at Arms .</note>
   <p>LINCOLN . Peace , hear me : he that will not see a red herring at a Harry groat , butter at elevenpence a pound , meal at nine shillings a bushel , and beef at four nobles a stone , list to me .</p>
   <p>GEORGE . It will come to that pass , if strangers be suffered . Mark him .</p>
   <p>LINCOLN . Our country is a great eating country ; ergo , they eat more in our country than they do in their own .</p>
   <p>CLOWN . By a halfpenny loaf , a day , troy weight .</p>
   <p>LINCOLN . They bring in strange roots , which is merely to the undoing of poor prentices ; for what 's a sorry parsnip to a good heart ?</p>
   <p>WILLIAMSON . Trash , trash ; they breed sore eyes , and tis enough to infect the city with the palsey .</p>
   <p>LINCOLN . Nay , it has infected it with the palsey ; for these bastards of dung , as you know they grow in dung , have infected us , and it is our infection will make the city shake , which partly comes through the eating of parsnips .</p>
   <p>CLOWN . True ; and pumpkins together .</p>
   <p>SERGEANT . What say ye to the mercy of the king ? Do ye refuse it ?</p>
   <p>LINCOLN . You would have us upon this , would you ? no , marry , do we not ; we accept of the king 's mercy , but we will show no mercy upon the strangers .</p>
   <p>SERGEANT . You are the simplest things that ever stood In such a question .</p>
   <p>LINCOLN . How say ye now , prentices ? prentices simple ! down with him !</p>
   <p>ALL . Prentices simple ! prentices simple !</p>
   <note>Enter the Lord Mayor , Surrey , Shrewsbury , More .</note>
   <p>LORD MAYOR . Hold ! in the king 's name , hold !</p>
   <p>SURREY . Friends , masters , countrymen —</p>
   <p>LORD MAYOR . Peace , how , peace ! I charge you , keep the peace !</p>
   <p>SHREWSBURY . My masters , countrymen —</p>
   <p>WILLIAMSON . The noble earl of Shrewsbury , let 's hear him .</p>
   <p>GEORGE . We 'll hear the earl of Surrey .</p>
   <p>LINCOLN . The earl of Shrewsbury .</p>
   <p>GEORGE . We 'll hear both .</p>
   <p>ALL . Both , both , both , both !</p>
   <p>LINCOLN . Peace , I say , peace ! are you men of wisdom , or what are you ?</p>
   <p>SURREY . What you will have them ; but not men of wisdom .</p>
   <p>ALL . We 'll not hear my lord of Surrey ; no , no , no , no , no ! Shrewsbury , Shrewsbury !</p>
   <p>MORE . Whiles they are o'er the bank of their obedience , Thus will they bear down all things .</p>
   <p>LINCOLN . Sheriff More speaks ; shall we hear Sheriff More speak ?</p>
   <p>DOLL . Let 's hear him : a keeps a plentyful shrievaltry , and a made my brother Arthur Watchins Seriant Safes yeoman : let 's hear Shrieve More .</p>
   <p>ALL . Shrieve More , More , More , Shrieve More !</p>
   <p>MORE . Even by the rule you have among yourselves , Command still audience .</p>
   <p>ALL . Surrey , Surrey ! More , More !</p>
   <p>LINCOLN : Peace , peace , silence , peace .</p>
   <p>GEORGE . Peace , peace , silence , peace .</p>
   <p>MORE . You that have voice and credit with the number Command them to a stillness .</p>
   <p>LINCOLN . A plague on them , they will not hold their peace ; the dual cannot rule them .</p>
   <p>MORE . Then what a rough and riotous charge have you , To lead those that the dual cannot rule ?— Good masters , hear me speak .</p>
   <p>DOLL . Aye , by th ’ mass , will we , More : th ’ art a good housekeeper , and I thank thy good worship for my brother Arthur Watchins .</p>
   <p>ALL . Peace , peace .</p>
   <p>MORE . Look , what you do offend you cry upon , That is , the peace : not one of you here present , Had there such fellows lived when you were babes , That could have topped the peace , as now you would , The peace wherein you have till now grown up Had been ta'en from you , and the bloody times Could not have brought you to the state of men . Alas , poor things , what is it you have got , Although we grant you get the thing you seek ?</p>
   <p>GEORGE . Marry , the removing of the strangers , which cannot choose but much advantage the poor handicrafts of the city .</p>
   <p>MORE . Grant them removed , and grant that this your noise Hath chid down all the majesty of England ; Imagine that you see the wretched strangers , Their babies at their backs and their poor luggage , Plodding tooth ports and costs for transportation , And that you sit as kings in your desires , Authority quite silent by your brawl , And you in ruff of your opinions clothed ; What had you got ? I 'll tell you : you had taught How insolence and strong hand should prevail , How order should be quelled ; and by this pattern Not one of you should live an aged man , For other ruffians , as their fancies wrought , With self same hand , self reasons , and self right , Would shark on you , and men like ravenous fishes Would feed on one another .</p>
   <p>DOLL . Before God , that 's as true as the Gospel .</p>
   <p>LINCOLN . Nay , this is a sound fellow , I tell you : let 's mark him .</p>
   <p>MORE . Let me set up before your thoughts , good friends , On supposition ; which if you will mark , You shall perceive how horrible a shape Your innovation bears : first , tis a sin Which oft the apostle did forewarn us of , Urging obedience to authority ; And twere no error , if I told you all , You were in arms against your God himself .</p>
   <p>ALL . Marry , God forbid that !</p>
   <p>MORE . Nay , certainly you are ; For to the king God hath his office lent Of dread , of justice , power and command , Hath bid him rule , and willed you to obey ; And , to add ampler majesty to this , He hath not only lent the king his figure , His throne and sword , but given him his own name , Calls him a god on earth . What do you , then , Rising gainst him that God himself installs , But rise against God ? what do you to your souls In doing this ? O , desperate as you are , Wash your foul minds with tears , and those same hands , That you like rebels lift against the peace , Lift up for peace , and your unreverent knees , Make them your feet to kneel to be forgiven ! Tell me but this : what rebel captain , As mutinies are incident , by his name Can still the rout ? who will obey a traitor ? Or how can well that proclamation sound , When there is no addition but a rebel To qualify a rebel ? You 'll put down strangers , Kill them , cut their throats , possess their houses , And lead the majesty of law in line , To slip him like a hound . Say now the king ( As he is clement , if th ’ offender mourn ) Should so much come to short of your great trespass As but to banish you , whether would you go ? What country , by the nature of your error , Should give you harbor ? go you to France or Flanders , To any German province , to Spain or Portugal , Nay , any where that not adheres to England ,— Why , you must needs be strangers : would you be pleased To find a nation of such barbarous temper , That , breaking out in hideous violence , Would not afford you an abode on earth , Whet their detested knives against your throats , Spurn you like dogs , and like as if that God Owed not nor made not you , nor that the claimants Were not all appropriate to your comforts , But chartered unto them , what would you think To be thus used ? this is the strangers case ; And this your mountanish inhumanity .</p>
   <p>ALL . Faith , a says true : let 's do as we may be done to .</p>
   <p>LINCOLN . We 'll be ruled by you , Master More , if you 'll stand our friend to procure our pardon .</p>
   <p>MORE . Submit you to these noble gentlemen , Entreat their mediation to the king , Give up yourself to form , obey the magistrate , And there 's no doubt but mercy may be found , If you so seek . To persist in it is present death : but , if you Yield yourselves , no doubt what punishment You in simplicity have incurred , his highness In mercy will most graciously pardon .</p>
   <p>ALL . We yield , and desire his highness ’ mercy .</p>
   <note>They lay by their weapons .</note>
   <p>MORE . No doubt his majesty will grant it you : But you must yield to go to several prisons , Till that his highness ’ will be further known .</p>
   <p>ALL . Most willingly ; whether you will have us .</p>
   <p>SHREWSBURY . Lord Mayor , let them be sent to several prisons , And there , in any case , be well intreated .— My lord of Surrey , please you to take horse , And ride to Cheapside , where the aldermen Are with their several companies in arms ; Will them to go unto their several wards , Both for the stay of furth mutiny , And for the apprehending of such persons As shall contend .</p>
   <p>SURREY . I go , my noble lord .</p>
   <note>Exit Surrey .</note>
   <p>SHREWSBURY . We 'll straight go tell his highness these good news ; Withal , Shrieve More , I 'll tell him how your breath Hath ransomed many a subject from sad death .</p>
   <note>Exit Shrewsbury and Cholmley .</note>
   <p>LORD MAYOR . Lincoln and Sherwin , you shall both to Newgate ; The rest unto the Counters .</p>
   <p>PALMER . Go guard them hence : a little breath well spent Cheats expectation in his fairest event .</p>
   <p>DOLL . Well , Sheriff More , thou hast done more with thy good words than all they could with their weapons : give me thy hand , keep thy promise now for the king 's pardon , or , by the Lord , I 'll call thee a plain coney-catcher .</p>
   <p>LINCOLN . Farewell , Shrieve More ; and as we yield by thee , So make our peace ; then thou dealst honestly .</p>
   <p>CLOWN . Aye , and save us from the gallows , else a devil 's double honestly !</p>
   <note>They are led away .</note>
   <p>LORD MAYOR . Master Shrieve More , you have preserved the city From a most dangerous fierce commotion ; For , if this limb of riot here in St. Martins Had joined with other branches of the city That did begin to kindle , twould have bred Great rage ; that rage much murder would have fed . Not steel , but eloquence hath wrought this good : You have redeemed us from much threatened blood .</p>
   <p>MORE . My lord and brethren , what I here have spoke , My country 's love , and next the city 's care , Enjoined me to ; which since it thus prevails , Think , God hath made weak More his instrument To thwart sedition 's violent intent . I think twere best , my lord , some two hours hence We meet at the Guildhall , and there determine That thorough every ward the watch be clad In armor , but especially proud That at the city gates selected men , Substantial citizens , do ward tonight , For fear of further mischief .</p>
   <p>LORD MAYOR . It shall be so : But yond me thinks my lord of Shrewsbury .</p>
   <note>Enter Shrewsbury .</note>
   <p>SHREWSBURY . My lord , his majesty sends loving thanks To you , your brethren , and his faithful subjects , Your careful citizens .— But , Master More , to you A rougher , yet as kind , a salutation : A knights creation is this knightly steel . Rise up , Sir Thomas More .</p>
   <p>MORE . I thank his highness for thus honoring me .</p>
   <p>SHREWSBURY . This is but first taste of his princely favor : For it hath pleased his high majesty ( Noting your wisdom and deserving merit ) To put this staff of honor in your hand , For he hath chose you of his Privy Council .</p>
   <p>MORE . My lord , for to deny my sovereign 's bounty Were to drop precious stones into the heaps Whence they first came ; To urge my imperfections in excuse , Were all as stale as custom : no , my lord , My service is my kings ; good reason why ,— Since life or death hangs on our sovereign 's eye .</p>
   <p>LORD MAYOR . His majesty hath honored much the city In this his princely choice .</p>
   <p>MORE . My lord and brethren , Though I depart for court my love shall rest With you , as heretofore , a faithful guest . I now must sleep in court , sound sleeps forbear ; The chamberlain to state is public care : Yet , in this rising of my private blood , My studious thoughts shall tend the city 's good .</p>
   <note>Enter Crofts .</note>
   <p>SHREWSBURY . How now , Crofts ! what news ?</p>
   <p>CROFTS . My lord , his highness sends express command That a record be entered of this riot , And that the chief and capital offenders Be thereon straight arraigned , for himself intends To sit in person on the rest tomorrow At Westminster .</p>
   <p>SHREWSBURY . Lord Mayor , you hear your charge .— Come , good Sir Thomas More , to court let 's hie ; You are th ’ appeaser of this mutiny .</p>
   <p>MORE . My lord , farewell : new days begets new tides ; Life whirls bout fate , then to a grave it slides .</p>

   </lg>
   <p>DOLL . Bravely , John Lincoln , let thy death express , That , as thou liv'dst a man , thou diest no less .</p>
   <p>LINCOLN . Doll Williamson , thine eyes shall witness it .— Then to all you that come to view mine end I must confess , I had no ill intent , But against such as wronged us over much : And now I can perceive it was not fit That private men should carve out their redress , Which way they list ; no , learn it now by me ,— Obedience is the best in each degree : And asking mercy meekly of my king , I patiently submit me to the law ; But God forgive them that were cause of it ! And , as a Christian , truly from my heart I likewise crave they would forgive me too ( As freely as I do forgive their wrong ) That others by example of the same Henceforth be warned to attempt the like Gainst any alien that repaireth hither . Fare ye well , all : the next time that we meet , I trust in heaven we shall each other greet .</p>
   <note>He leaps off .</note>
   <p>DOLL . Farewell , John Lincoln : say all what they can , Thou liv'dst a good fellow , and diedst an honest man .</p>
   <p>CLOWN . Would I wear so fair on my journey ! the first stretch is the worst , me thinks .</p>
   <p>SHERIFF . Bring Williamson there forward .</p>
   <p>DOLL . Good Master Shrieve , I have an earnest suit , And , as you are a man , deny't me not .</p>
   <p>SHERIFF . Woman , what is it ? be it in my power , Thou shalt obtain it .</p>
   <p>DOLL . Let me die next , sir ; that is all I crave : You know not what a comfort you shall bring To my poor heart , to die before my husband .</p>
   <p>SHERIFF . Bring her to death ; she shall have her desire .</p>
   <p>CLOWN . Sir , and I have a suit for you too .</p>
   <p>SHERIFF . What is it ?</p>
   <p>CLOWN . That , as you have hanged Lincoln first , and will hang her next , so you will not hang me at all .</p>
   <p>SHERIFF . Nay , you set ope ’ the Counter gates , and you must hang for the folly .</p>
   <p>CLOWN . Well , then , so much for it !</p>
   <p>DOLL . Sir , your free bounty much contents my mind . Commend me to that good shrieve Master More , And tell him , had't not been for his persuasion , John Lincoln had not hung here as he does : We would first have locked us up in Leadenhall , And there been burnt to ashes with the roof .</p>
   <p>SHERIFF . Woman , what Master More did was a subject 's duty , And hath so pleased our gracious lord the king , That he is hence removed to higher place , And made of council to his majesty .</p>
   <p>DOLL . Well is he worthy of it , by my troth , An honest , wise , well spoken gentleman ; Yet would I praise his honesty much more , If he had kept his word , and saved our lives : But let that pass ; men are but men , and so Words are but words , and pays not what men owe .— You , husband , since perhaps the world may say That through my means thou comest thus to thy end , Here I begin this cup of death to thee , Because thou shalt be sure to taste no worse Than I have taken that must go before thee . What though I be a woman ? that 's no matter ; I do owe God a death , and I must pay him . Husband , give me thy hand ; be not dismayed ; This chair being chaired , then all our debt is paid . Only two little babes we leave behind us , And all I can bequeath them at this time Is but the love of some good honest friend , To bring them up in charitable sort : What , masters ! he goes upright that never halts , And they may live to mend their parents ’ faults .</p>
   <p>WILLIAMSON . Why , well said , wife ; yfaith , thou cheerest my heart : Give me thy hand ; let 's kiss , and so let 's part .</p>
   <note>He kisses her on the ladder .</note>
   <p>DOLL . The next kiss , Williamson , shall be in heaven .— Now cheerily , lads ! George Betts , a hand with thee ; And thine too , Rafe , and thine , good honest Sherwin . Now let me tell the women of this town , No stranger yet brought Doll to lying down : So long as I an Englishman can see , Nor French nor Dutch shall get a kiss of me ; And when that I am dead , for me yet say , I died in scorn to be a stranger 's prey .</p>
   <note>A great shout and noise , cry within ‘ Pardon , pardon , pardon , pardon ! Room for the Earl of Surrey , room there , room ! ’ .</note>
   <note>Enter Surrey .</note>
   <p>SURREY . Save the man 's life , if it be possible .</p>
   <p>SHERIFF . It is too late , my lord ; he 's dead already .</p>
   <p>SURREY . I tell ye , Master Sheriff , you are too forward , To make such haste with men unto their death ; I think your pains will merit little thanks , Since that his highness is so merciful As not to spill the blood of any subject .</p>
   <p>SHERIFF . My noble lord , would we so much had known ! The Councils ’ warrant hastened our dispatch ; It had not else been done so suddenly .</p>
   <p>SURREY . Sir Thomas More humbly upon his knee Did beg the lives of all , since on his word They did so gently yield : the king hath granted it , And made him Lord High Chancellor of England . According as he worthily deserves . Since Lincoln 's life cannot be had again , Then for the rest , from my dread sovereign 's lips , I here pronounce free pardon for them all .</p>
   <p>ALL . God save the king , God save the king ! My good Lord Chancellor , and the Earl of Surrey !</p>
   <note>Flinging up caps .</note>
   <p>DOLL . And Doll desires it from her very heart , More 's name may live for this right noble part ; And whensoere we talk of ill May day , Praise More ....</p>
   <p>SURREY . In hope his highness ’ clemency and mercy , Which in the arms of mild and meek compassion Would rather clip you , as the loving nurse Oft doth the wayward infant , then to leave you To the sharp rod of justice , so to draw you To shun such lewd assemblies as beget Unlawful riots and such traitorous acts , That , striking with the hand of private hate , Maim your dear country with a public wound :— Oh God , that Mercy , whose majestic brow Should be unwrinkled , and that awful Justice , Which looketh through a vail of sufferance Upon the frailty of the multitude , Should with the clamours of outrageous wrongs Be stirred and wakened thus to punishment !— But your deserved death he doth forgive : Who gives you life , pray all he long may live .</p>
   <p>ALL . God save the king , God save the king ! My good Lord Chancellor , and the Earl of Surrey !</p>
   <note>Exeunt .</note>
   <p>SCENE II . Chelsea . A Room in More 's House .</p>
   <note>A table being covered with a green carpet , a state cushion on it , and the Purse and Mace lying thereon , enter Sir Thomas More .</note>
   <p>MORE . it is in heaven that I am thus and thus ; And that which we profanely term our fortunes Is the provision of the power above , Fitted and shaped just to that strength of nature Which we are borne withal . Good God , good Go , That I from such an humble bench of birth Should step as twere up to my country 's head , And give the law out there ! I , in my father 's life , To take prerogative and tithe of knees From elder kinsmen , and him bind by my place To give the smooth and dexter way to me That owe it him by nature ! Sure , these things , Not physicked by respect , might turn our blood To much corruption : but , More , the more thou hast , Either of honor , office , wealth , and calling , Which might excite thee to embrace and hub them , The more doe thou in serpents ’ natures think them ; Fear their gay skins with thought of their sharp state ; And let this be thy maxim , to be great Is when the thread of hayday is once ‘ spon , A bottom great wound up great undone .— Come on , sir : are you ready ?</p>
   <note>Enter Randall , attired like Sir Thomas More .</note>
   <p>RANDALL . Yes , my lord , I stand but on a few points ; I shall have done presently . Before God , I have practised your lordship 's shift so well , that I think I shall grow proud , my lord .</p>
   <p>MORE . Tis fit thou shouldst wax proud , or else thou'lt ne'er Be near allied to greatness . Observe me , sirrah . The learned clark Erasmus is arrived Within our English court : last night I hear He feasted with our honored English poet , The Earl of Surrey ; and I learned today The famous clark of Rotterdam will visit Sir Thomas More . Therefore , sir , take my seat ; you are Lord Chancellor : dress your behavior According to my carriage ; but beware You talk not over much , for twill betray thee : Who prates not much seems wise ; his wit few scan ; While the tongue blabs tales of the imperfect man . I 'll see if great Erasmus can distinguish Merit and outward ceremony .</p>
   <p>RANDALL . If I do not serve a share for playing of your lordship well , let me be yeoman usher to your sumpter , and be banished from wearing of a gold chain forever .</p>
   <p>MORE . Well , sir , I 'll hide our motion : act my part With a firm boldness , and thou winst my heart .</p>
   <note>Enter the Shrieve , with Faulkner a ruffian , and Officers .</note>
   <p>How now ! what 's the matter ?</p>
   <p>FAULKNER . Tug me not , I 'm no bear . ‘ Sblood , if all the dogs in Paris Garden hung at my tail , I 'd shake ‘ em off with this , that I 'll appear before no king christened but my good Lord Chancellor .</p>
   <p>SHRIEVE . We 'll christen you , sirrah .— Bring him forward .</p>
   <p>MORE . How now ! what tumults make you ?</p>
   <p>FAULKNER . The azured heavens protect my noble Lord Chancellor !</p>
   <p>MORE . What fellow 's this ?</p>
   <p>SHRIEVE . A ruffian , my lord , that hath set half the city in an uproar .</p>
   <p>FAULKNER . My lord —</p>
   <p>SHRIEVE . There was a fray in Paternoster-row , and because they would not be parted , the street was choked up with carts .</p>
   <p>FAULKNER . My noble lord , Paniar Allies throat was open .</p>
   <p>MORE . Sirrah , hold your peace .</p>
   <p>FAULKNER . I 'll prove the street was not choked , but is as well as ever it was since it was a street .</p>
   <p>SHRIEVE . This fellow was a principal broacher of the broil .</p>
   <p>FAULKNER . ‘ Sblood , I broached none ; it was broached and half run out , before I had a lick at it .</p>
   <p>SHRIEVE . And would be brought before no justice but your honor .</p>
   <p>FAULKNER . I am hailed , my noble lord .</p>
   <p>MORE . No ear to choose for every trivial noise but mine , and in so full a time ? Away ! You wrong me , Master Shrieve : dispose of him At your own pleasure ; send the knave to Newgate .</p>
   <p>FAULKNER . To Newgate ! ‘ sblood , Sir Thomas More , I appeal , I appeal from Newgate to any of the two worshipful Counters .</p>
   <p>MORE . Fellow , whose man are you , that are thus lusty ?</p>
   <p>FAULKNER . My name 's Jack Faulkner ; I serve , next under God and my prince , Master Morris , secretary to my Lord of Winchester .</p>
   <p>MORE . A fellow of your hair is very fit To be a secretary 's follower !</p>
   <p>FAULKNER . I hope so , my lord . The fray was between the Bishops ’ men of Ely and Winchester ; and I could not in honor but part them . I thought it stood not with my reputation and degree to come to my questions and answers before a city justice : I knew I should to the pot .</p>
   <p>MORE . Thou hast been there , it seems , too late already .</p>
   <p>FAULKNER . I know your honor is wise and so forth ; and I desire to be only cathecized or examined by you , my noble Lord Chancellor .</p>
   <p>MORE . Sirrah , sirrah , you are a busy dangerous ruffian .</p>
   <p>FAULKNER . Ruffian !</p>
   <p>MORE . How long have you worn this hair ?</p>
   <p>FAULKNER . I have worn this hair ever since I was born .</p>
   <p>MORE . You know that 's not my question , but how long Hath this shag fleece hung dangling on they head ?</p>
   <p>FAULKNER . How long , my lord ? why , sometimes thus long , sometimes lower , as the Fates and humors please .</p>
   <p>MORE . So quick , sir , with me , ha ? I see , good fellow , Thou lovest plain dealing . Sirrah , tell me now , When were you last at barbers ? how long time Have you upon your head worn this shag hair ?</p>
   <p>FAULKNER . My lord , Jack Faulkner tells no Aesops fables : troth , I was not at barbers this three years ; I have not been cut not will not be cut , upon a foolish vow , which , as the Destinies shall direct , I am sworn to keep .</p>
   <p>MORE . When comes that vow out ?</p>
   <p>FAULKNER . Why , when the humors are purged , not this three years .</p>
   <p>MORE . Vows are recorded in the court of Heaven , For they are holy acts . Young man , I charge thee And do advise thee , start not from that vow : And , for I will be sure thou shalt not shrieve , Besides , because it is an odious sight To see a man thus hairy , thou shalt lie In Newgate till thy vow and thy three years Be full expired .— Away with him !</p>
   <p>FAULKNER . My lord —</p>
   <p>MORE . Cut off this fleece , and lie there but a month .</p>
   <p>FAULKNER . I 'll not lose a hair to be Lord Chancellor of Europe .</p>
   <p>MORE . To Newgate , then . Sirrah , great sins are bred In all that body where there 's a foul head . Away with him .</p>
   <note>Exeunt all except Randall .</note>
   <note>Enter Surrey , Erasmus , and Attendants .</note>
   <p>SURREY . Now , great Erasmus , you approach the presence Of a most worthy learned gentleman : This little isle holds not a truer friend Unto the arts ; nor doth his greatness add A feigned flourish to his worthy parts ; He 's great in study ; that 's the statist 's grace , That gains more reverence than the outward place .</p>
   <p>ERASMUS . Report , my lord , hath crossed the narrow seas , And to the several parts of Christendom , Hath borne the fame of your Lord Chancellor : I long to see him , whom with loving thoughts I in my study oft have visited . Is that Sir Thomas More ?</p>
   <p>SURREY . It is , Erasmus : Now shall you view the honorablest scholar , The most religious politician , The worthiest counsellor that tends our state . That study is the general watch of England ; In it the prince 's safety , and the peace That shines upon our commonwealth , are forged By loyal industry .</p>
   <p>ERASMUS . I doubt him not To be as near the life of excellence As you proclaim him , when his meanest servants Are of some weight : you saw , my lord , his porter Give entertainment to us at the gate In Latin good phrase ; what 's the master , then , When such good parts shine in his meanest men ?</p>
   <p>SURREY . His Lordship hath some weighty business ; For , see , yet he takes no notice of us .</p>
   <p>ERASMUS . I think twere best I did my duty to him In a short Latin speech .— Qui in celiberima patria natus est ett gloriosa , plus habet negotii ut in lucem veniat quam qui —</p>
   <p>RANDALL . I prithee , good Erasmus , be covered . I have forsworn speaking of Latin , else , as I am true counsellor , I 'd tickle you with a speech . Nay , sit , Erasmus ;— sit , good my Lord of Surrey . I 'll make my lady come to you anon , if she will , and give you entertainment .</p>
   <p>ERASMUS . Is this Sir Thomas More ?</p>
   <p>SURREY . Oh good Erasmus , you must conceive his vain : He 's ever furnished with these conceits .</p>
   <p>RANDALL . Yes , faith , my learned poet doth not lie for that matter : I am neither more nor less than merry Sir Thomas always . Wilt sup with me ? by God , I love a parlous wise fellow that smells of a politician better than a long progress .</p>
   <note>Enter Sir Thomas More .</note>
   <p>SURREY . We are deluded ; this is not his lordship .</p>
   <p>RANDALL . I pray you , Erasmus , how long will the Holland cheese in your country keep without maggots ?</p>
   <p>MORE . Fool , painted barbarism , retire thyself Into thy first creation !</p>
   <note>Exit Randall .</note>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Thus you see ,</l>
     <l n="2">My loving learned friends , how far respect</l>
     <l n="3">Waits often on the ceremonious train</l>
     <l n="4">Of base illiterate wealth , whilst men of schools ,</l>
     <l n="5">Shrouded in poverty , are counted fools .</l>
     <l n="6">Pardon , thou reverent German , I have mixed</l>
     <l n="7">So slight a jest to the fair entertainment</l>
     <l n="8">Of thy most worthy self ; for know , Erasmus ,</l>
     <l n="9">Mirth wrinkles up my face , and I still crave ,</l>
     <l n="10">When that forsakes me I may hug my grave .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>ERASMUS . Your honor 's merry humor is best physic Unto your able body ; for we learn Where melancholy chokes the passages Of blood and breath , the erected spirit still Lengthens our days with sportful exercise : Study should be the saddest time of life . The rest a sport exempt from thought of strife .</p>
   <p>MORE . Erasmus preacheth gospel against physic , My noble poet .</p>
   <p>SURREY . Oh , my Lord , you tax me In that word poet of much idleness : It is a study that makes poor our fate ; Poets were ever thought unfit for state .</p>
   <p>MORE . O , give not up fair poesy , sweet lord , To such contempt ! That I may speak my heart , It is the sweetest heraldry of art , That sets a difference ‘ tween the tough sharp holly And tender bay tree .</p>
   <p>SURREY . Yet , my lord , It is become the very logic number To all mechanic sciences .</p>
   <p>MORE . Why , I 'll show the reason : This is no age for poets ; they should sing To the loud canon heroica facta ; Qui faciunt reges heroica carmina laudant : And , as great subjects of their pen decay , Even so unphysicked they do melt away .</p>

   <p>FAULKNER . No , my lord ; lost all that ever God sent me .</p>
   <p>MORE . God sent thee into the world as thou art now , With a short hair . How quickly are three years Run out of Newgate !</p>
   <p>FAULKNER . I think so , my lord ; for there was but a hair 's length between my going thither and so long time .</p>
   <p>MORE . Because I see some grace in thee , go free .— Discharge him , fellows .— Farewell , Master Morris .— Thy head is for thy shoulders now more fit ; Thou hast less hair upon it , but more wit .</p>
   <note>Exit .</note>
   <p>MORRIS . Did not I tell thee always of these locks ?</p>
   <p>FAULKNER . And the locks were on again , all the goldsmiths in Cheapside should not pick them open . ‘ Sheart , if my hair stand not on end when I look for my face in a glass , I am a polecat . Here 's a lousy jest ! but , if I notch not that rogue Tom barber , that makes me look thus like a Brownist , hang me ! I 'll be worse to the nitticall knave than ten tooth drawings . Here 's a head , with a pox !</p>
   <p>MORRIS . What ails thou ? art thou mad now ?</p>
   <p>FAULKNER . Mad now ! nails , if loss of hair cannot mad a man , what can ? I am deposed , my crown is taken from me . More had been better a scoured Moreditch than a notched me thus : does he begin sheepshearing with Jack Faulkner ?</p>
   <p>MORRIS . Nay , and you feed this vein , sir , fare you well .</p>
   <p>FAULKNER . Why , farewell , frost . I 'll go hang myself out for the Poll Head . Make a Saracen of Jack ?</p>

Why , this is cheerful news : friends go and come : Reverend Erasmus , who delicious words Express the very soul and life of wit , Newly took sad leave of me , and with tears Troubled the silver channel of the Thames , Which , glad of such a burden , proudly swelled And on her bosom bore him toward the sea : He 's gone to Rotterdam ; peace go with him ! He left me heavy when he went from hence ; But this recomforts me ; the kind Lord Mayor , His brethren aldermen , with their fair wives , Will feast this night with us : why , so it should be ; More 's merry heart lives by good company .— Good gentlemen , be careful ; give great charge Our diet be made dainty for the taste ; For , of all people that the earth affords , The Londoners fare richest at their boards .</p>

   <p>MORE . But one boy ? then I see , There 's but few women in the play .</p>
   <p>PLAYER . Three , my lord ; Dame Science , Lady Vanity , And Wisdom she herself .</p>
   <p>MORE . And one boy play them all ? by our Lady , he 's laden . Well , my good fellow , get ye straight together , And make ye ready with what haste ye may .— Proud their supper gainst the play be done , Else shall we stay our guests here over long .— Make haste , I pray ye .</p>
   <p>PLAYER . We will , my lord .</p>
   <note>Exit Servant and Player .</note>
   <p>MORE . Where are the waits ? go , big them play , To spend the time a while .</p>
   <note>Enter Lady .</note>
   <p>How now , madame ?</p>
   <p>LADY . My lord , th ’ are coming hither .</p>
   <p>MORE . Th ’ are welcome . Wife , I 'll tell ye one thing ; One sport is somewhat mended ; we shall have A play tonight , The Marriage of Wit and Wisdom , And acted by my good Lord Cardinal 's players ; How like ye that , wife ?</p>
   <p>LADY . My lord , I like it well . See , they are coming .</p>
   <note>The waits plays ; enter Lord Mayor , so many Aldermen as may , the Lady Mayoress in scarlet , with other Ladies and Sir Thomas More 's Daughters ; Servants carrying lighted torches by them .</note>
   <p>MORE . Once again , welcome , welcome , my good Lord Mayor , And brethren all , for once I was your brother , And so I am still in heart : it is not state That can our love from London separate . True , upstart fools , by sudden fortune tried , Regard their former mates with naught but pride . But they that cast an eye still whence they came , Know how they rose , and how to use the same .</p>
   <p>LORD MAYOR . My lord , you set a gloss on London 's fame , And make it happy ever by your name . Needs must we say , when we remember More , ‘ Twas he that drove rebellion from our door With grave discretions mild and gentle breath , Oh , how our city is by you renowned , And with your virtues our endeavors crowned !</p>
   <p>MORE . No more , my good Lord Mayor : but thanks to all , That on so short a summons you would come To visit him that holds your kindness dear .— Madame , you are not merry with my Lady Mayoress And these fair ladies ; pray ye , seat them all :— And here , my lord , let me appoint your place ;— The rest to seat themselves :— nay , I 'll weary ye ; You will not long in haste to visit me .</p>
   <p>LADY . Good madame , sit ; in sooth , you shall sit here .</p>
   <p>LADY MAYORESS . Good madame , pardon me ; it may not be .</p>
   <p>LADY . In troth , I 'll have it so : I 'll sit here by ye .— Good ladies , sit .— More stools here , ho !</p>
   <p>LADY MAYORESS . It is your favour , madame , makes me thus Presume above my merit .</p>
   <p>LADY . When we come to you , Then shall you rule us as we rule you here . Now must I tell ye , madame , we have a play , To welcome ye withal ; how good so ere , That know not I ; my lord will have it so .</p>
   <p>MORE . Wife , hope the best ; I am sure they 'll do their best : They that would better , comes not at their feast . My good Lord Cardinal 's players , I thank them for it , Play us a play , to lengthen out your welcome : They say it is The Marriage of Wit and Wisdom , A theme of some import , how ere it prove ; But , if art fail , we 'll inch it out with love .—</p>
   <note>Enter a Servant .</note>
   <p>What , are they ready ?</p>
   <p>SERVANT . My lord , one of the players craves to speak with you .</p>
   <p>MORE . With me ! where is he ?</p>
   <note>Enter Inclination , the Vice , ready .</note>
   <p>INCLINATION . Here , my lord .</p>
   <p>MORE . How now ! what 's the matter ?</p>
   <p>INCLINATION . We would desire your honor but to stay a little ; one of my fellows is but run to Oagles for a long beard for young Wit , and he 'll be here presently .</p>
   <p>MORE . A long beard for young Wit ! why , man , he may be without a beard till he come to marriage , for wit goes not all by the hair . When comes Wit in ?</p>
   <p>INCLINATION . In the second scene , next to the Prologue , my lord .</p>
   <p>MORE . Why , play on till that scene come , and by that time Wit 's beard will be grown , or else the fellow returned with it . And what part playest thou ?</p>
   <p>INCLINATION . Inclination the Vice , my lord .</p>
   <p>MORE . Gramercies , now I may take the vice if I list : and wherefore hast thou that bridle in thy hand ?</p>
   <p>INCLINATION . I must be bridled anon , my lord .</p>
   <p>MORE . And thou beest not saddled too , it makes no matter , for then Wit 's inclination may gallop so fast , that he will outstrip Wisdom , and fall to folly .</p>
   <p>INCLINATION . Indeed , so he does to Lady Vanity ; but we have no folly in our play .</p>
   <p>MORE . Then there 's no wit in ‘ t , I 'll be sworn : folly waits on wit , as the shadow on the body , and where wit is ripest there folly still is readiest . But begin , I prithee : we 'll rather allow a beardless Wit than Wit all beard to have no brain .</p>
   <p>INCLINATION . Nay , he has his apparel on too , my lord , and therefore he is the readier to enter .</p>
   <p>MORE . Then , good Inclination , begin at a venter .—</p>
   <note>Exit Inclination .</note>

     <l n="1">My Lord Mayor ,</l>
     <l n="2">Wit lacks a beard , or else they would begin :</l>
     <l n="3">I 'd lend him mine , but that it is too thin .</l>

   </lg>
   <p>PROLOGUE . Now , for as much as in these latter days , Throughout the whole world in every land , Vice doth increase , and virtue decays , Iniquity having the upper hand ; We therefore intend , good gentle audience , A pretty short interlude to play at this present , Desiring your leave and quiet silence , To show the same , as is meet and expedient , It is called The Marriage of Wit and Wisdom , A matter right pithy and pleasing to hear , Whereof in brief we will show the whole sum ; But I must be gone , for Wit doth appear .</p>
   <note>Exit . Enter Wit ruffling , and Inclination the Vice .</note>
   <p>WIT . In an arbor green , asleep whereas I lay , The birds sang sweetly in the midst of the day , I dreamed fast of mirth and play ,— In youth is pleasure , in youth is pleasure , Methought I walked still to and fro , And from her company I could not go ; But when I waked , it was not so ,— In youth is pleasure , in youth is pleasure . Therefore my heart is surely plight , Of her alone to have a sight , Which is my joy and heart 's delight ,— In youth is pleasure , in youth is pleasure .</p>
   <p>MORE . Mark ye , my lord , this is Wit without a beard : what will he be by that time he comes to the commodity of a beard ?</p>
   <p>INCLINATION . Oh , sir , the ground is the better on which she doth go ; For she will make better cheer with a little she can get , Than many a one can with a great banquet of meat .</p>
   <p>WIT . And is her name Wisdom ?</p>
   <p>INCLINATION . I , sir , a wife most fit For you , my good master , my dainty sweet Wit .</p>
   <p>WIT . To be in her company my heart it is set : Therefore I prithee to let us begone ; For unto Wisdom Wit hath inclination .</p>
   <p>INCLINATION . Oh , sir , she will come her self even anon ; For I told her before where we would stand . And then she said she would beck us with her hand .— Back with these boys and saucy great knaves !</p>
   <note>Flourishing a dagger .</note>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">What , stand ye here so big in your braves ?</l>
     <l n="2">My dagger about your coxcombs shall walk ,</l>

     <l n="4">WIT .</l>
     <l n="5">But will she take pains to come for us hither ?</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>INCLINATION . I warrant ye ; therefore you must be familiar with her ; When she commeth in place , You must her embrace Somewhat handsomely , Least she think it danger , Because you are a stranger , To come in your company .</p>
   <p>WIT . I warrant thee , Inclination , I will be busy : Oh , how Wit longs to be in Wisdom 's company !</p>
   <note>Enter Lady Vanity singing , and beckoning with her hand .</note>
   <p>VANITY . Come hither , come hither , come hither , come : Such cheer as I have , thou shalt have some .</p>
   <p>MORE . This is Lady Vanity , I 'll hold my life :— Beware , good Wit , you take not her to wife .</p>
   <p>INCLINATION . What , unknown honesty ? a word in your ear .</p>
   <note>She offers to depart .</note>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">You shall not be gone as yet , I swear :</l>
     <l n="2">Here 's none but friends , you need not to fray ;</l>
     <l n="3">This young gentleman loves ye , therefore you must stay .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>WIT . I trust in me she will think no danger , For I love well the company of fair women ; And though to you I am a stranger , Yet Wit may pleasure you now and then .</p>
   <p>VANITY . Who , you ? nay , you are such a holy man , That to touch on you dare not be bold ; I think you would not kiss a young woman , If one would give ye twenty pound in gold .</p>
   <p>WIT . Yes , in good sadness , lady , that I would : I could find in my heart to kiss you in your smock .</p>
   <p>VANITY . My back is broad enough to bear that mock ; For it hath been told me many a time That you would be seen in no such company as mine .</p>
   <p>WIT . Not Wit in the company of Lady Wisdom ? Oh Jove , for what do I hither come ?</p>
   <p>INCLINATION . Sir , she did this nothing else but to prove Whether a little thing would you move To be angry and fret : What , and if one said so ? Let such trifling matters go And with a kind kiss come out of her debt .—</p>
   <p>Is Luggins come yet with the beard ?</p>
   <note>Enter another Player .</note>
   <p>PLAYER . No , faith , he is not come : alas , what shall we do ?</p>
   <p>INCLINATION . Forsooth , we can go no further till our fellow Luggins come ; for he plays Good Council , and now he should enter , to admonish Wit that this is Lady Vanity , and not Lady Wisdom .</p>
   <p>MORE . Nay , and it be no more but so , ye shall not tarry at a stand for that ; we 'll not have our play marred for lack of a little good council : till your fellow come , I 'll give him the best council that I can .— Pardon me , my Lord Mayor ; I love to be merry .—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Oh ... Wit , thou art now on the bow hand ,</l>
     <l n="2">And blindly in thine own opinion dost stand .</l>
     <l n="3">I tell thee , this naughty lewd Inclination</l>
     <l n="4">Does lead thee amiss in a very strange fashion :</l>
     <l n="5">This is not Wisdom , but Lady Vanity ;</l>
     <l n="6">Therefore list to Good Council , and be ruled by me .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>INCLINATION . In troth , my lord , it is as right to Lugginses part as can be .— Speak , Wit .</p>
   <p>MORE . Nay , we will not have our audience disappointed , if I can help it .</p>
   <p>WIT . Art thou Good Council , and will tell me so ? Wouldst thou have Wit from Lady Wisdom to go ? Thou art some deceiver , I tell thee verily , In saying that this is Lady Vanity .</p>
   <p>MORE . Wit , judge not things by the outward show ; The eye oft mistakes , right well you do know : Good Council assures thee upon his honesty , That this is not Wisdom , but Lady Vanity .</p>
   <note>Enter Luggins with the beard .</note>
   <p>INCLINATION . Oh , my lord , he is come ; now we shall go forward .</p>
   <p>MORE . Art thou come ? well , fellow , I have hoped to save thine honesty a little . Now , if thou canst give Wit any better council than I have done , spare not : there I leave him to they mercy . But by this time , I am sure , our banquet 's ready : My lord and ladies , we will taste that first , And then they shall begin the play again , Which through the fellow 's absence , and by me , Instead of helping , hath been hindered .— Prepare against we come .— Lights there , I say !— Thus fools oft times do help to mar the play .</p>
   <note>Exeunt all but players .</note>
   <p>WIT . Fie , fellow Luggins , you serve us handsomely ; do ye not , think ye ?</p>
   <p>LUGGINS . Why , Oagle was not within , and his wife would not let me have the beard ; and , by my troth , I ran so fast that I sweat again .</p>
   <p>INCLINATION . Do ye hear , fellows ? would not my lord make a rare player ? oh , he would uphold a company beyond all hope , better than Mason among the king 's players ! Did ye mark how extemprically he fell to the matter , and spake Lugginses part almost as it is in the very book set down ?</p>
   <p>WIT . Peace ; do ye know what ye say ? my lord a player ! let us not meddle with any such matters : yet I may be a little proud that my lord hath answered me in my part . But come , let us go , and be ready to begin the play again .</p>
   <p>LUGGINS . I , that 's the best , for now we lack nothing .</p>
   <note>Enter a Servingman .</note>
   <p>MAN . Where be these players ?</p>
   <p>ALL . Here , sir .</p>
   <p>MAN . My lord is sent for to the court , And all the guests do after supper part ; And , for he will not trouble you again , By me for your reward a sends 8 angels , With many thanks . But sup before you go : It is his will you should be fairly entreated : Follow , I pray ye .</p>
   <p>WIT . This , Luggins , is your negligence ; Wanting Wit 's beard brought things into dislike ; For otherwise the play had been all seen , Where now some curious citizen disgraced it , And discommending it , all is dismissed .</p>
   <p>VICE . Fore God , a says true . But hear ye , sirs : 8 angels , ha ! my lord would never give 8 angels more or less for 12d ; other it should be 3l , 5l , or ten li . ; there 's 20s wanting , sure .</p>
   <p>WIT . Twenty to one , tis so . I have a trick : my lord comes ; stand aside .</p>
   <note>Enter More , with Attendants with Purse and Mace .</note>
   <p>MORE . In haste to counsel ! what 's the business now , That all so late his highness sends for me ?— What seekst thou , fellow ?</p>
   <p>WIT . Nay , nothing : your lordship sent 8 angels by your man , and I have lost two of them in the rishes .</p>
   <p>MORE . Wit , look to that :— 8 angels ! I did send them ten .— Who gave it them ?</p>
   <p>MAN . I , my lord ; I had no more about me ; But by and by they shall rescue the rest .</p>
   <p>MORE . Well , Wit , twas wisely done ; thou playest Wit well indeed , Not to be thus deceived of thy right .— Am I a man , by office truly ordained Equally to decide true right his own , And shall I have deceivers in my house ? Then what avails my bounty , when such servants Deceive the poor of what the Master gives ? Go on , and pull his coat over his ears : There are too many such .— Give them their right .— Wit , let thy fellows thank thee : twas well done ; Thou now deservest to match with Lady Wisdom .</p>
   <note>Exit More with Attendants .</note>
   <p>VICE . God a mercy , Wit !— Sir , you had a master Sir Thomas More more ; but now we shall have more .</p>
   <p>LUGGINS . God bless him ! I would there were more of his mind ! a loves our quality ; and yet he 's a learned man , and knows what the world is .</p>
   <p>CLOWN . Well , a kind man , and more loving than many other : but I think we ha ’ met with the first ....</p>
   <p>LUGGINS . First served his man that had our angels ; and he may chance dine with Duke Humphrey tomorrow , being turned away today . Come , let 's go .</p>
   <p>CLOWN . And many such rewards would make us all ride , and horse us with the best nags in Smithfield .</p>
   <note>Exeunt .</note>
   <p>SCENE II . Whitehall . The Council chamber .</p>
   <note>Enter the Earls of Shrewsbury , Surrey , Bishop of Rochester , and other Lords ; severally , doing courtesy to each other ; Clerk of the Council waiting bareheaded .</note>
   <p>SURREY . Good morrow to my Lord of Shrewsbury .</p>
   <p>SHREWSBURY . The like unto the honoured Earl of Surrey . Yond comes my Lord of Rochester .</p>
   <p>ROCHESTER . Good morrow , my good lords .</p>
   <p>SURREY . Clerk of the Council , what time is't of day ?</p>
   <p>CLERK . Past eight of clock , my lord .</p>
   <p>SHREWSBURY . I wonder that my good Lord Chancellor Doth stay so long , considering there 's matters Of high importance to be scanned upon .</p>
   <p>SURREY . Clerk of the Council , certify his lordship The lords expect him here .</p>
   <p>ROCHESTER . It shall not need ; Yond comes his lordship .</p>
   <note>Enter Sir Thomas More , with Purse and Mace borne before him .</note>
   <p>MORE . Good morrow to this fair assembly . Come , my good lords , let 's sit . Oh serious square !</p>
   <note>They sit .</note>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Upon this little board is daily scanned</l>
     <l n="2">The health and preservation of the land ;</l>
     <l n="3">We the physicians that effect this good ,</l>
     <l n="4">Now by choice diet , anon by letting blood ;</l>
     <l n="5">Our toil and careful watching brings the king</l>
     <l n="6">In league with slumbers , to which peace doth sing .—</l>
     <l n="7">Avoid the room there !—</l>
     <l n="8">What business , lords , today ?</l>
   </lg>
   <p>SHREWSBURY . This , my good lord ; About the entertainment of the emperor Gainst the perfidious French into our pay .</p>
   <p>SURREY . My lords , as tis the custom in this place The youngest should speak first , so , if I chance In this case to speak youngly , pardon me . I will agree , France now hath her full strength , As having new recovered the pale blood Which war sluiced forth ; and I consent to this , That the conjunction of our English forces With arms of Germany may soon bring This prize of conquest in . But , then , my lords , As in the moral hunting twixt the lion And other beasts , force joined with greed Frighted the weaker sharers from their parts ; So , if the empire 's sovereign chance to put His plea of partnership into war 's court , Swords should decide the difference , and our blood In private tears lament his entertainment .</p>
   <p>SHREWSBURY . To doubt the worst is still the wise man 's shield , That arms him safely : but the world knows this , The emperor is a man of royal faith ; His love unto our sovereign brings him down From his imperial seat , to march in pay Under our English flag , and wear the cross , Like some high order , on his manly breast ; Thus serving , he 's not master of himself , But , like a colonel commanding other , Is by the general over-awed himself .</p>
   <p>ROCHESTER . Yet , my good lord —</p>
   <p>SHREWSBURY . Let me conclude my speech . As subjects share no portion in the conquest Of their true sovereign , other than the merit That from the sovereign guerdons the true subject ; So the good emperor , in a friendly league Of amity with England , will not soil His honor with the theft of English spoil .</p>
   <p>MORE . There is no question but this entertainment Will be most honorable , most commodious . I have oft heard good captains wish to have Rich soldiers to attend them , such as would fight Both for their lives and livings ; such a one Is the good emperor : I would to God , We had ten thousand of such able men ! Hah , then there would appear no court , no city , But , where the wars were , they would pay themselves . Then , to prevent in French wars England 's loss , Let German flags wave with our English cross .</p>
   <note>Enter Sir Thomas Palmer .</note>
   <p>PALMER . My lords , his majesty hath sent by me These articles enclosed , first to be viewed , And then to be subscribed to : I tender them In that due reverence which befits this place .</p>
   <note>With great reverence .</note>
   <p>MORE . Subscribe these articles ! stay , let us pause ; Our conscience first shall parley with our laws .— My Lord of Rochester , view you the paper .</p>
   <p>ROCHESTER . Subscribe to these ! now , good Sir Thomas Palmer , Beseech the king that he will pardon me : My heart will check my hand whilst I do write ; Subscribing so , I were an hypocrite .</p>
   <p>PALMER . Do you refuse it , then , my lord ?</p>
   <p>ROCHESTER . I do , Sir Thomas .</p>
   <p>PALMER . Then here I summon you forthwith t ’ appear Before his majesty , to answer there This capital contempt .</p>
   <p>ROCHESTER . I rise and part , In lieu of this to tender him my heart .</p>
   <note>He riseth .</note>
   <p>PALMER . Wilt please your honor to subscribe , my lord ?</p>
   <p>MORE . Sir , tell his highness , I entreat Some time for to bethink me of this task : In the meanwhile I do resign mine office Into my sovereign 's hands .</p>
   <p>PALMER . Then , my lord , Hear the prepared order from the king : On your refusal , you shall straight depart Unto your house at Chelsea , till you know Our sovereign 's further pleasure .</p>
   <p>MORE . Most willingly I go .— My lords , if you will visit me at Chelsea , We 'll go a fishing , and with a cunning net , Not like weak film , we 'll catch none but the great : Farewell , my noble lords . Why , this is right : Good morrow to the sun , to state good night !</p>
   <note>Exit More .</note>
   <p>PALMER . Will you subscribe , my lords ?</p>
   <p>SURREY . Instantly , good Sir Thomas , We 'll bring the writing unto our sovereign .</p>
   <note>They write .</note>
   <p>PALMER . My Lord of Rochester , You must with me , to answer this contempt .</p>
   <p>ROCHESTER . This is the worst , Who 's freed from life is from all care exempt .</p>
   <note>Exit Rochester and Palmer .</note>
   <p>SURREY . Now let us hasten to our sovereign . Tis strange that my Lord Chancellor should refuse The duty that the law of God bequeaths Unto the king .</p>
   <p>SHREWSBURY . Come , let us in . No doubt His mind will alter , and the bishop 's too : Error in learned heads hath much to do .</p>
   <note>Exeunt .</note>
   <p>SCENE III . Chelsea .</p>
   <note>Enter the Lady More , her two Daughters , and Master Roper , as walking .</note>
   <p>ROPER . Madame , what ails ye for to look so sad ?</p>
   <p>LADY MORE . Troth , son , I know not what ; I am not sick , And yet I am not well . I would be merry ; But somewhat lies so heavy on heart , I cannot choose but sigh . You are a scholar ; I pray ye , tell me , may one credit dreams ?</p>
   <p>ROPER . Why ask you that , dear madame ?</p>
   <p>LADY MORE . Because tonight I had the strangest dream That ere my sleep was troubled with . Me thought twas night , And that the king and queen went on the Thames In barges to hear music : my lord and I Were in a little boat me thought ,— Lord , Lord , What strange things live in slumbers !— and , being near , We grappled to the barge that bare the king . But after many pleasing voices spent In that still moving music house , me though The violence of the stream did sever us Quite from the golden fleet , and hurried us Unto the bridge , which with unused horror We entered at full tide : thence some slight shoot Being carried by the waves , our boat stood still Just opposite the Tower , and there it turned And turned about , as when a whirl-pool sucks The circled waters : me thought that we both cried , Till that we sunk : where arm in arm we died .</p>
   <p>ROPER . Give no respect , dear madame , to fond dreams : They are but slight illusions of the blood .</p>
   <p>LADY MORE . Tell me not all are so ; for often dreams Are true diviners , either of good or ill : I cannot be in quiet till I hear How my lord fares .</p>
   <p>ROPER . [ aside . ] No it .— Come hither , wife : I will not fright thy mother , to interpret The nature of a dream ; but trust me , sweet , This night I have been troubled with thy father Beyond all thought .</p>
   <p>ROPER 'S WIFE . Truly , and so have I : Methought I saw him here in Chelsea Church , Standing upon the roodloft , now defac 'd ; And whilst he kneeled and prayed before the image , It fell with him into the upper-choir , Where my poor father lay all stained in blood .</p>
   <p>ROPER . Our dreams all meet in one conclusion , Fatal , I fear .</p>
   <p>LADY MORE . What 's that you talk ? I pray ye , let me know it .</p>
   <p>ROPER 'S WIFE . Nothing , good mother .</p>
   <p>LADY MORE . This is your fashion still ; I must know nothing . Call Master Catesby ; he shall straight to court , And see how my lord does : I shall not rest , Until my heart leave panting on his breast .</p>
   <note>Enter Sir Thomas More merrily , Servants attending .</note>
   <p>DAUGHTER . See where my father comes , joyful and merry .</p>
   <p>MORE . As seamen , having passed a troubled storm , Dance on the pleasant shore ; so I — oh , I could speak Now like a poet ! now , afore God , I am passing light !— Wife , give me kind welcome : thou wast wont to blame My kissing when my beard was in the stubble ; But I have been trimmed of late ; I have had A smooth court shaving , in good faith , I have .—</p>
   <note>Daughters kneel .</note>
   <p>God bless ye !— Son Roper , give me your hand .</p>
   <p>ROPER . Your honor 's welcome home .</p>
   <p>MORE . Honor ! ha ha !— And how dost , wife ?</p>
   <p>ROPER . He bears himself most strangely .</p>
   <p>LADY MORE . Will your lordship in ?</p>
   <p>MORE . Lordship ! no , wife , that 's gone : The ground was slight that we did lean upon .</p>
   <p>LADY MORE . Lord , that your honor ne'er will leave these jests ! In faith , it ill becomes ye .</p>
   <p>MORE . Oh , good wife , Honor and jests are both together fled ; The merriest councillor of England 's dead .</p>
   <p>LADY MORE . Who 's that , my lord ?</p>
   <p>MORE . Still lord ! the Lord Chancellor , wife .</p>
   <p>LADY MORE . That 's you .</p>
   <p>MORE . Certain ; but I have changed my life . Am I not leaner than I was before ? The fat is gone ; my title 's only More . Contented with one style , I 'll live at rest : They that have many names are not still best . I have resigned mine office : count'st me not wise ?</p>
   <p>LADY MORE . Oh God !</p>
   <p>MORE . Come , breed not female children in your eyes : The king will have it so .</p>
   <p>LADY MORE . What 's the offense ?</p>
   <p>MORE . Tush , let that pass ; we 'll talk of that anon . The king seems a physician to my fate ; His princely mind would train me back to state .</p>
   <p>ROPER . Then be his patient , my most honored father .</p>
   <p>MORE . Oh , son Roper , Ubi turpis est medicine , sanari piget !— No , wife , be merry ;— and be merry , all : You smiled at rising , weep not at my fall . Let 's in , and hear joy like to private friends , Since days of pleasure have repentant ends : The light of greatness is with triumph born ; It sets at midday oft with public scorn .</p>
   <p>SCENE IV . The Tower .</p>
   <note>Enter the Bishop of Rochester , Surrey , Shrewsbury , Lieutenant of the Tower , and Warders with weapons .</note>
   <p>ROCHESTER . Your kind persuasions , honorable lords , I can but thank ye for ; but in this breast There lives a soul that aims at higher things Than temporary pleasing earthly kings . God bless his highness even with all my heart !— We shall meet one day , though that now we part .</p>
   <p>SURREY . We not misdoubt , your wisdom can discern What best befits it ; yet in love and zeal We could entreat , it might be otherwise .</p>
   <p>SHREWSBURY . No doubt , your fatherhood will by yourself Consider better of the present case , And grow as great in favor as before .</p>
   <p>ROCHESTER . For that , as pleaseth God . In my restraint From wordly causes , I shall better see Into myself than at proud liberty : The Tower and I will privately confer Of things , wherein at freedom I may err . But I am troublesome unto your honors , And hold ye longer than becomes my duty .— Master Lieutenant , I am now your charge ; And though you keep my body , yet my love Waits on my king and you , while Fisher lives .</p>
   <p>SURREY . Farewell , my Lord of Rochester ; we 'll pray For your release , and labour't as we may .</p>
   <p>SHREWSBURY . Thereof assure yourself ; so do we leave ye , And to your happy private thoughts bequeath ye .</p>

   <p>MORE . Nay , good night rather ; Your honor 's crest-fain with your happy father .</p>
   <p>ROPER . Oh , what formality , what square observance , Lives in a little room ! here public care Gags not the eyes of slumber ; here fierce riot Ruffles not proudly in a coat of trust , Whilst , like a pawn at chess , he keeps in rank With kings and mighty fellows ; yet indeed Those men that stand on tiptoe smile to see Him pawn his fortunes .</p>
   <p>MORE . True , son ,.... Nor does the wanton tongue here screw itself Into the ear , that like a vise drinks up The iron instrument .</p>
   <p>LADY MORE . We are here at peace .</p>
   <p>MORE . Then peace , good wife .</p>
   <p>LADY MORE . For , keeping still in compass , a strange point In times new navigation we have sailed Beyond our course .</p>
   <p>MORE . Have done .</p>
   <p>LADY MORE . We are exiled the court .</p>
   <p>MORE . Still thou harpest on that : Tis sin for to deserve that banishment ; But he that ne'er knew court , courts sweet content .</p>
   <p>LADY MORE . Oh , but , dear husband —</p>
   <p>MORE . I will not hear thee , wife ; The winding labyrinth of thy strange discourse Will ne'er have end . Sit still ; and , my good wife , Entreat thy tongue be still ; or , credit me , Thou shalt not understand a word we speak ; We 'll talk in Latin . Humida vallis raros patitur fulminis ictus , More rest enjoys the subject meanly bred Than he that bears the kingdom in his head . Great men are still musicians , else the world lies ; They learn low strains after the notes that rise .</p>
   <p>ROPER . Good sir , be still yourself , and but remember How in this general court of short-lived pleasure , The world , creation is the ample food That is digested in the maw of time : If man himself be subject to such ruin , How shall his garment , then , or the loose points That tie respect unto his awful place , Avoid destruction ? Most honored father-in-law , The blood you have bequeathed these several hearts To nourish your posterity , stands firm ; And , as with joy you led us first to rise , So with like hearts we 'll lock preferment 's eyes .</p>
   <p>MORE . Close them not , then , with tears : for that ostent Gives a wet signal of your discontent . If you will share my fortunes , comfort then ; An hundred smiles for one sigh : what ! we are men : Resign wet passion to these weaker eyes , Which proves their sex , but grants it ne'er more wise . Let 's now survey our state . Here sits my wife , And dear esteemed issue ; yonder stand My loving servants : now the difference Twixt those and these . Now you shall hear my speak Like More in melancholy . I conceive that nature Hath sundry metals , out of which she frames Us mortals , each in valuation Outprizing other : of the finest stuff The finest features come : the rest of earth , Receive base fortune even before their birth ; Hence slaves have their creation ; and I think Nature provides content for the base mind ; Under the whip , the burden , and the toil , Their low-wrought bodies drudge in patience ; As for the prince in all his sweet-gorged maw , And his rank flesh , that sinfully renews The noon 's excess in the night 's dangerous surfeits . What means or misery from our birth doth flow Nature entitles to us ; that we owe : But we , being subject to the rack of hate , Falling from happy life to bondage state , Having seen better days , now know the lack Of glory that once reared each high-fed back . But you , that in your age did ne'er view better , Challenged not fortune for your thriftless debter .</p>
   <p>CATESBY . Sir , we have seen far better days than these .</p>
   <p>MORE . I was the patron of those days , and know Those were but painted days , only for show . Then grieve not you to fall with him that gave them : Generosis servis gloriosum mori . Dear Gough , thou art my learned secretary ; You , Master Catesby , steward of my house ; The rest like you have had fair time to grow In sun-shine of my fortunes . But I must tell ye , Corruption is fled hence with each man 's office ; Bribes , that make open traffic twixt the soul And netherland of hell , deliver up Their guilty homage to the second lords . Then , living thus untainted , you are well : Truth is no pilot for the land of hell .</p>
   <note>Enter a Servant .</note>
   <p>SERVANT . My lord , there are new lighted at the gate The Earls of Surrey and of Shrewsbury , And they expect you in the inner court .</p>

   <p>MORE . Why , how now , wife ! They are but come to visit their old friend .</p>
   <p>LADY MORE . Oh , God , I fear , I fear !</p>
   <p>MORE . What shouldst thou fear , fond woman ? Justum , si fractus illabatur orbis , inpavidum ferient ruinae . Here let me live estranged from great men 's looks ; They are like golden flies on leaden hooks .</p>
   <note>Enter the Earls , Downs with his mace , and Attendants .</note>
   <p>SHREWSBURY . Good morrow , good Sir Thomas .</p>
   <note>Kind salutations .</note>
   <p>SURREY . Good day , good madame .</p>
   <p>MORE . Welcome , my good lords . What ails your lordships look so melancholy ? Oh , I know ; you live in court , and the court diet Is only friend to physic .</p>
   <p>SURREY . Oh , Sir Thomas , Our words are now the kings , and our sad looks The interest of your love ! We are sent to you From our mild sovereign , once more to demand If you 'll subscribe unto those articles He sent ye th ’ other day : be well advised ; For , on mine honor , lord , grave Doctor Fisher Bishop of Rochester , at the self same instant Attached with you , is sent unto the Tower For the like obstinacy : his majesty Hath only sent you prisoner to your house ; But , if you now refuse for to subscribe , A stricter course will follow .</p>

   <note>Kneeling and weeping .</note>
   <p>BOTH DAUGHTERS . Dear father !</p>
   <p>MORE . See , my lords , This partner and these subjects to my flesh Prove rebels to my conscience ! But , my good lords , If I refuse , must I unto the Tower ?</p>
   <p>SHREWSBURY . You must , my lord ; here is an officer Ready for to arrest you of high treason .</p>
   <p>LADY MORE AND DAUGHTERS . Oh , God , oh , God !</p>
   <p>ROPER . Be patient , good madam .</p>
   <p>MORE . Aye , Downs , ist thou ? I once did save thy life , When else by cruel riotous assault Thou hadst been torn in pieces : thou art reserved To be my summoner to yond spiritual court . Give me thy hand ; good fellow , smooth thy face : The diet that thou drinkst is spic 'd with mace , And I could ne'er abide it ; ‘ twill not disgest , Twill lie too heavily , man , on my weak breast .</p>
   <p>SHREWSBURY . Be brief , my lord , for we are limited Unto an hour .</p>
   <p>MORE . Unto an hour ! tis well : The bell soon shall toll my knell .</p>
   <p>LADY MORE . Dear loving husband , if you respect not me , Yet think upon your daughters .</p>
   <note>Kneeling .</note>
   <p>MORE . Wife , stand up ; I have bethought me , And I 'll now satisfy the king 's good pleasure .</p>
   <note>Pointing to himself .</note>
   <p>BOTH DAUGHTERS . Oh , happy alteration !</p>
   <p>SHREWSBURY . Come , then , subscribe , my lord .</p>
   <p>SURREY . I am right glad of this your fair conversion .</p>
   <p>MORE . Oh , pardon me ! I will subscribe to go unto the Tower With all submissive willingness , and thereto add My bones to strengthen the foundation Of Julius Caesar 's palace . Now , my lord , I 'll satisfy the king , even with my blood ; Now will I wrong your patience .— Friend , do thine office .</p>
   <p>DOWNES . Sir thomas More , Lord Chancellor of England , I arrest you in the king 's name of high treason .</p>
   <p>MORE . Gramercies , friend . To a great prison , to discharge the strife Commenc 'd twixt conscience and my frailer life , More now must march . Chelsea , adieu , adieu ! Strange farewell ! thou shalt ne'er more see More true , For I shall ne'er see thee more .— Servants , farewell .— Wife , mar not thine indifferent face ; be wise : More 's widow 's husband , he must make thee rise .— Daughters ....: — what 's here , what 's here ? Mine eye had almost parted with a tear .— Dear son , possess my virtue , that I ne'er gave .— Grave More thus lightly walks to a quick grave .</p>
   <p>ROPER . Curae leves loquuntur , ingentes stupent .</p>
   <p>MORE . You that way in ; mind you my course in prayer : By water I to prison , to heaven through air .</p>

   <p>CATESBY . Take it as it is meant , a kind remembrance Of a fair kinder lord , with whose sad fall He gives up house and farewell to us all : Thus the fair spreading oak falls not alone , But all the neighbor plants and under-trees Are crushed down with his weight . No more of this : Come , and receive your due , and after go Fellow-like hence , copartners of one woe .</p>

   <p>LIEUTENANT . Perhaps , my lord , two thousand pound a year .</p>
   <p>MORE . Master Lieutenant , I protest to you , I never had the means in all my life To purchase one poor hundred pound a year : I think I am the poorest Chancellor That ever was in England , though I could wish , For credit of the place , that my estate were better .</p>
   <p>LIEUTENANT . It 's very strange .</p>
   <p>MORE . It will be found as true . I think , sir , that with most part of my coin I have purchased as strange commodities As ever you heard tell of in your life .</p>
   <p>LIEUTENANT . Commodities , my lord ! Might I ( without offence ) enquire of them ?</p>
   <p>MORE . Croutches , Master Lieutenant , and bare cloaks ; For halting soldiers and poor needy scholars Have had my gettings in the Chancery : To think but what a cheat the crown shall have By my attainder ! I prithee , if thou beest a gentleman , Get but a copy of my inventory . That part of poet that was given me Made me a very unthrift ; For this is the disease attends us all , Poets were never thrifty , never shall .</p>

Did you not see , when I was Chancellor , I was so clogged with suitors every hour , I could not sleep , nor dine , nor sup in quiet ? Here 's none of this ; here I can sit and talk With my honest keeper half a day together , Laugh and be merry : why , then , should you weep ?</p>
   <p>ROPER . These tears , my lord , for this your long restraint Hope had dried up , with comfort that we yet , Although imprisoned , might have had your life .</p>

   <p>LADY MORE . His highness shall be certified thereof Immediately .</p>
   <note>Offering to depart .</note>
   <p>MORE . Nay , hear me , wife ; first let me tell ye how : I thought to have had a barber for my beard ; Now , I remember , that were labour lost , The headsman now shall cut off head and all .</p>
   <p>ROPER 'S WIFE . Father , his majesty , upon your meek submission , Will yet ( they say ) receive you to his grace In as great credit as you were before .</p>
   <p>MORE . ........ Has appointed me to do a little business . If that were past , my girl , thou then shouldst see What I would say to him about that matter ; But I shall be so busy until then , I shall not tend it .</p>
   <p>DAUGHTER . Ah , my dear father !</p>
   <p>LADY MORE . Dear lord and husband !</p>
   <p>MORE . Be comforted , good wife , to live and love my children ; For with thee leave I all my care of them .— Son Roper , for my sake that have loved thee well , And for her virtue 's sake , cherish my child .— Girl , be not proud , but of thy husband 's love ; Ever retain thy virtuous modesty ; That modesty is such a comely garment As it is never out of fashion , sits as fair upon the meaner woman as the empress ; No stuff that gold can buy is half so rich , Nor ornament that so becomes a woman . Live all and love together , and thereby You give your father a rich obsequy .</p>
   <p>BOTH DAUGHTERS . Your blessing , dear father .</p>

   <p>SECOND WARDER . Good morrow , Master Shrieves of London ; Master Lieutenant Wills ye repair to the limits of the Tower , There to receive your prisoner .</p>
   <p>FIRST SHERIFF . Go back , and tell his worship we are ready .</p>
   <p>SECOND SHERIFF . Go bid the officers make clear the way , There may be passage for the prisoner .</p>
   <note>Enter Lieutenant and his Guard , with More .</note>
   <p>MORE . Yet , God be thanked , here 's a fair day toward , To take our journey in . Master Lieutenant , It were fair walking on the Tower leads .</p>
   <p>LIEUTENANT . And so it might have liked my sovereign lord , I would to God you might have walked there still !</p>
   <note>He weeps .</note>
   <p>MORE . Sir , we are walking to a better place . Oh , sir , your kind and loving tears Are like sweet odors to embalm your friend ! Thank your good lady ; since I was your guest , She has made me a very wanton , in good sooth .</p>
   <p>LIEUTENANT . Oh , I had hoped we should not yet have parted !</p>
   <p>MORE . But I must leave ye for a little while ; Within an hour or two you may look for me ; But there will be so many come to see me , That I shall be so proud , I will not speak ; And , sure , my memory is grown so ill , I fear I shall forget my head behind me .</p>
   <p>LIEUTENANT . God and his blessed angels be about ye !— Here , Master Shrieves , receive your prisoner .</p>
   <p>MORE . Good morrow , Master Shrieves of London , to ye both : I thank ye that ye will vouchsafe to meet me ; I see by this you have not quite forgot That I was in times past , as you are now , A sheriff of London .</p>
   <p>SECOND SHERIFF . Sir , then you know our duty doth require it .</p>
   <p>MORE . I know it well , sir , else I would have been glad You might have saved a labour at this time . Ah , Master Sheriff , you and I have been of old acquaintance ! you were a patient auditor of mine , when I read the divinity lecture at St. Lawrence 's .</p>
   <p>SECOND SHERIFF . Sir Thomas More , I have heard you oft , As many other did , to our great comfort .</p>
   <p>MORE . Pray God , you may so now , with all my heart ! And , as I call to mind , When I studied the law in Lincoln 's Inn , I was of council with ye in a cause .</p>
   <p>SECOND SHERIFF . I was about to say so , good Sir Thomas ......</p>
   <p>MORE . Oh , is this the place ? I promise ye , it is a goodly scaffold : In sooth , I am come about a headless errand , For I have not much to say , now I am here . Well , let 's ascend , a God 's name : In troth , methinks , your stair is somewhat weak ; I prithee , honest friend , lend me thy hand To help me up ; as for my coming down , Let me alone , I 'll look to that myself .</p>

     <l n="1">[ As he is going up the stairs , enters the Earls of Surrey and</l>
     <l n="2">Shrewsbury . ]</l>

   <p>My Lords of Surrey and Shrewsbury , give me your hands . Yet before we .... ye see , though it pleaseth the king to raise me thus high , yet I am not proud , for the higher I mount , the better I can see my friends about me . I am now on a far voyage , and this strange wooden horse must bear me thither ; yet I perceive by your looks you like my bargain so ill , that there 's not one of ye all dare enter with me . Truly , here 's a most sweet gallery ; [ Walking . ] I like the air of it better than my garden at Chelsea . By your patience , good people , that have pressed thus into my bedchamber , if you 'll not trouble me , I 'll take a sound sleep here .</p>
   <p>SHREWSBURY . My lord , twere good you'ld publish to the world Your great offence unto his majesty .</p>
   <p>MORE . My lord , I 'll bequeath this legacy to the hangman , [ Gives him his gown . ] and do it instantly . I confess , his majesty hath been ever good to me ; and my offence to his highness makes me of a state pleader a stage player ( though I am old , and have a bad voice ) , to act this last scene of my tragedy . I 'll send him ( for my trespass ) a reverend head , somewhat bald ; for it is not requisite any head should stand covered to so high majesty : if that content him not , because I think my body will then do me small pleasure , let him but bury it , and take it .</p>
   <p>SURREY . My lord , my lord , hold conference with your soul ; You see , my lord , the time of life is short .</p>
   <p>MORE . I see it , my good lord ; I dispatched that business the last night . I come hither only to be let blood ; my doctor here tells me it is good for the headache .</p>
   <p>HANGMAN . I beseech thee , my lord , forgive me !</p>
   <p>MORE . Forgive thee , honest fellow ! why ?</p>
   <p>HANGMAN . For your death , my lord .</p>
   <p>MORE . O , my death ? I had rather it were in thy power to forgive me , for thou hast the sharpest action against me ; the law , my honest friend , lies in thy hands now : here 's thy fee [ His purse . ] ; and , my good fellow , let my suit be dispatched presently ; for tis all one pain , to die a lingering death , and to live in the continual mill of a lawsuit . But I can tell thee , my neck is so short , that , if thou shouldst behead an hundred noblemen like myself , thou wouldst ne'er get credit by it ; therefore ( look ye , sir ) , do it handsomely , or , of my word , thou shalt never deal with me hereafter .</p>
   <p>HANGMAN . I 'll take an order for that , my lord .</p>
   <p>MORE . One thing more ; take heed thou cutst not off my beard : oh , I forgot ; execution passed upon that last night , and the body of it lies buried in the Tower .— Stay ; ist not possible to make a scape from all this strong guard ? it is . There is a thing within me , that will raise And elevate my better part bove sight Of these same weaker eyes ; and , Master Shrieves , For all this troop of steel that tends my death , I shall break from you , and fly up to heaven . Let 's seek the means for this .</p>
   <p>HANGMAN . My lord , I pray ye , put off your doublet .</p>
   <p>MORE . Speak not so coldly to me ; I am hoarse already ; I would be loathe , good fellow , to take more . Point me the block ; I ne'er was here before .</p>
   <p>HANGMAN . To the east side , my lord .</p>
   <p>MORE . Then to the east We go to sigh ; that o'er , to sleep in rest . Here More forsakes all mirth ; good reason why ; The fool of flesh must with her frail life die . No eye salute my trunk with a sad tear : Our birth to heaven should be thus , void of fear .</p>
   <note>Exit with Hangman , etc .</note>
   <p>SURREY . A very learned worthy gentleman Seals error with his blood . Come , we 'll to court . Let 's sadly hence to perfect unknown fates , Whilst he tends prograce to the state of states .</p>
   <p>FINIS</p>
