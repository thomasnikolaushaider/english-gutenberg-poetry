      <docTitle><titlePart>HERO AND LEANDER By Christopher Marlowe and George Chapman TO THE RIGHT WORSHIPFUL SIR THOMAS WALSINGHAM , KNIGHT .</titlePart></docTitle>
      <epigraph>
       <p>Sir , we think not ourselves discharged of the duty we owe to our friend when we have brought the breathless body to the earth ; for , albeit the eye there taketh his ever-farewell of that beloved object , yet the impression of the man that hath been dear unto us , living an after-life in our memory , there putteth us in mind of farther obsequies due unto the deceased ; and namely of the performance of whatsoever we may judge shall make to his living credit and to the effecting of his determinations prevented by the stroke of death . By these meditations ( as by an intellectual will ) I suppose myself executor to the unhappily deceased author of this poem ; upon whom knowing that in his lifetime you bestowed many kind favours , entertaining the parts of reckoning and worth which you found in him with good countenance and liberal affection , I cannot but see so far into the will of him dead , that whatsoever issue of his brain should chance to come abroad , that the first breath it should take might be the gentle air of your liking ; for , since his self had been accustomed thereunto , it would prove more agreeable and thriving to his right children than any other foster counten - ance whatsoever . At this time seeing that this unfinished tragedy happens under my hands to be imprinted , of a double duty , the one to yourself , the other to the deceased , I present the same to your most favourable allowance , offering my utmost self now and ever to be ready at your worship 's disposing . EDWARD BLUNT . Note : The first two Sestiads were written by Marlowe ; the last four by Chapman , who supplied also the Arguments for the six Sestiads . THE FIRST SESTIAD THE ARGUMENT OF THE FIRST SESTIAD Hero 's description and her love 's ; The fane of Venus where he moves His worthy love-suit , and attains ; Whose bliss the wrath of Fates restrains For Cupid 's grace to Mercury : Which tale the author doth imply .</p>

      <docTitle><titlePart>On Hellespont , guilty of true love 's blood , In view and opposite two cities stood , Sea-borderers , disjoin 'd by Neptune 's might ; The one Abydos , the other Sestos hight . At Sestos Hero dwelt ; Hero the fair , Whom young Apollo courted for her hair , And offer 'd as a dower his burning throne , Where she should sit , for men to gaze upon . The outside of her garments were of lawn , The lining purple silk , with gilt stars drawn ; Her wide sleeves green , and border 'd with a grove , Where Venus in her naked glory strove To please the careless and disdainful eyes Of proud Adonis , that before her lies ; Her kirtle blue , whereon was many a stain , Made with the blood of wretched lovers slain . Upon her head she ware a myrtle wreath , From whence her veil reach 'd to the ground beneath : Her veil was artificial flowers and leaves , Whose workmanship both man and beast deceives : Many would praise the sweet smell as she past , When ‘ twas the odour which her breath forth cast ; And there for honey bees have sought in vain , And , beat from thence , have lighted there again . About her neck hung chains of pebble-stone , Which , lighten 'd by her neck , like diamonds shone . She ware no gloves ; for neither sun nor wind Would burn or parch her hands , but , to her mind , Or warm or cool them , for they took delight To play upon those hands , they were so white . Buskins of shell , all silver 'd , used she , And branch 'd with blushing coral to the knee ; Where sparrows perch 'd , of hollow pearl and gold , Such as the world would wonder to behold : Those with sweet water oft her handmaid fills , Which , as she went , would cherup through the bills . Some say , for her the fairest Cupid pin 'd , And , looking in her face , was strooken blind . But this is true ; so like was one the other , As he imagin 'd Hero was his mother ; And oftentimes into her bosom flew , About her naked neck his bare arms threw , And laid his childish head upon her breast , And , with still panting rock , there took his rest . So lovely-fair was Hero , Venus ’ nun , As Nature wept , thinking she was undone , Because she took more from her than she left , And of such wondrous beauty her bereft : Therefore , in sign her treasure suffer 'd wrack , Since Hero 's time hath half the world been black . Amorous Leander , beautiful and young , ( Whose tragedy divine Musæus sung ,) Dwelt at Abydos ; since him dwelt there none For whom succeeding times make greater moan . His dangling tresses , that were never shorn , Had they been cut , and unto Colchos borne , Would have allur 'd the venturous youth of Greece To hazard more than for the golden fleece . Fair Cynthia wish 'd his arms might be her sphere ; Grief makes her pale , because she moves not there . His body was as straight as Circe 's wand ; Jove might have sipt out nectar from his hand . Even as delicious meat is to the tast , So was his neck in touching , and surpast The white of Pelops ’ shoulder : I could tell ye , How smooth his breast was , and how white his belly ; And whose immortal fingers did imprint That heavenly path with many a curious dint That runs along his back ; but my rude pen Can hardly blazon forth the loves of men , Much less of powerful gods : let it suffice That my slack Muse sings of Leander 's eyes ; Those orient cheeks and lips , exceeding his That leapt into the water for a kiss Of his own shadow , and , despising many , Died ere he could enjoy the love of any . Had wild Hippolytus Leander seen , Enamour 'd of his beauty had he been : His presence made the rudest peasant melt , That in the vast uplandish country dwelt ; The barbarous Thracian soldier , mov 'd with nought , Was mov 'd with him , and for his favour sought . Some swore he was a maid in man 's attire , For in his looks were all that men desire ,— A pleasant-smiling cheek , a speaking eye , A brow for love to banquet royally ; And such as knew he was a man , would say , “ Leander , thou art made for amorous play : Why art thou not in love , and lov 'd of all ? Though thou be fair , yet be not thine own thrall . ” The men of wealthy Sestos every year , For his sake whom their goddess held so dear , Rose-cheek 'd Adonis , kept a solemn feast : Thither resorted many a wandering guest To meet their loves : such as had none at all , Came lovers home from this great festival ; For every street , like to a firmament , Glister 'd with breathing stars , who , where they went , Frighted the melancholy earth , which deem 'd Eternal heaven to burn , for so it seem 'd , As if another Phaëton had got The guidance of the sun 's rich chariot . But , far above the loveliest , Hero shin 'd , And stole away th ’ enchanted gazer 's mind ; For like sea nymphs ’ inveigling harmony , So was her beauty to the standers by ; Nor that night-wandering , pale , and watery star ( When yawning dragons draw her thirling car From Latmus ’ mount up to the gloomy sky , Where , crown 'd with blazing light and majesty , She proudly sits ) more over-rules the flood Than she the hearts of those that near her stood . Even as when gaudy nymphs pursue the chase , Wretched Ixion 's shaggy-footed race , Incens 'd with savage heat , gallop amain From steep pine-bearing mountains to the plain , So ran the people forth to gaze upon her , And all that view 'd her were enamour 'd on her : And as in fury of a dreadful fight , Their fellows being slain or put to flight , Poor soldiers stand with fear of death dead-strooken , So at her presence all surpris 'd and tooken , Await the sentence of her scornful eyes ; He whom she favours lives ; the other dies : There might you see one sigh ; another rage ; And some , their violent passions to assuage Compile sharp satires ; but , alas , too late ! For faithful love will never turn to hate ; And many , seeing great princes were denied , Pin 'd as they went , and thinking on her died . On this feast-day ,— O cursed day and hour !— Went Hero thorough Sestos , from her tower To Venus ’ temple , where unhappily , As after chanc 'd , they did each other spy . So fair a church as this had Venus none : The walls were of discolour 'd jasper-stone , Wherein was Proteus carv 'd ; and over-head A lively vine of green sea-agate spread , Where by one hand light-headed Bacchus hung , And with the other wine from grapes out-wrung . Of crystal shining fair the pavement was ; The town of Sestos call 'd it Venus ’ glass : There might you see the gods , in sundry shapes , Committing heady riots , incest , rapes ; For know , that underneath this radiant flour Was Danäe 's statue in a brazen tower ; Jove slily stealing from his sister 's bed , To dally with Idalian Ganymed , And for his love Europa bellowing loud , And tumbling with the Rainbow in a cloud ; Blood-quaffing Mars heaving the iron net Which limping Vulcan and his Cyclops set ; Love kindling fire , to burn such towns as Troy ; Silvanus weeping for the lovely boy That now is turn 'd into a cypress-tree , Under whose shade the wood-gods love to be . And in the midst a silver altar stood : There Hero , sacrificing turtle 's blood , Vail 'd to the ground , veiling her eyelids close ; And modestly they open 'd as she rose : Thence flew Love 's arrow with the golden head ; And thus Leander was enamoured . Stone-still he stood , and evermore he gaz 'd , Till with the fire , that from his countenance blaz 'd , Relenting Hero 's gentle heart was strook : Such force and virtue hath an amorous look . It lies not in our power to love or hate , For will in us is over-rul 'd by fate . When two are stript long ere the course begin , We wish that one should lose , the other win ; And one especially do we affect Of two gold ingots , like in each respect : The reason no man knows ; let it suffice , What we behold is censur 'd by our eyes . Where both deliberate , the love is slight : Who ever lov 'd , that lov 'd not at first sight ? He kneel 'd ; but unto her devoutly pray 'd : Chaste Hero to herself thus softly said , “ Were I the saint he worships , I would hear him ; ” And , as she spake those words , came somewhat near him . He started up ; she blush 'd as one asham 'd ; Wherewith Leander much more was inflam 'd . He touch 'd her hand ; in touching it she trembled : Love deeply grounded , hardly is dissembled . These lovers parled by the touch of hands : True love is mute , and oft amazed stands . Thus while dumb signs their yielding hearts entangled , The air with sparks of living fire was spangled ; And Night , deep-drench 'd in misty Acheron , Heav 'd up her head , and half the world upon Breath 'd darkness forth ( dark night is Cupid 's day ): And now begins Leander to display Love 's holy fire , with words , with sighs , and tears ; Which , like sweet music , enter 'd Hero 's ears ; And yet at every word she turn 'd aside , And always cut him off , as he replied . At last , like to a bold sharp sophister , With cheerful hope thus he accosted her . “ Fair creature , let me speak without offence : I would my rude words had the influence To lead thy thoughts as thy fair looks do mine ! Then shouldst thou be his prisoner , who is thine . Be not unkind and fair ; mis-shapen stuff Are of behaviour boisterous and rough . O , shun me not , but hear me ere you go ! God knows , I cannot force love as you do : My words shall be as spotless as my youth , Full of simplicity and naked truth . This sacrifice , whose sweet perfume descending From Venus ’ altar , to your footsteps bending , Doth testify that you exceed her far , To whom you offer , and whose nun you are . Why should you worship her ? her you surpass As much as sparkling diamons flaring glass . A diamond set in lead his worth retains ; A heavenly nymph , belov 'd of human swains , Receives no blemish , but oftimes more grace ; Which makes me hope , although I am but base , Base in respect of thee divine and pure , Dutiful service may thy love procure ; And I in duty will excel all other , As thou in beauty dost exceed Love 's mother . Nor heaven nor thou were made to gaze upon : As heaven preserves all things , so save thou one . A stately builded ship , well rigg 'd and tall , The ocean maketh more majestical : Why vow'st thou , then , to live in Sestos here , Who on Love 's seas more glorious wouldst appear ? Like untun 'd golden strings all women are , Which long time lie untouch 'd , will harshly jar . Vessels of brass , oft handed , brightly shine : What difference betwixt the richest mine And basest mould , but use ? for both , not us 'd , Are of like worth . Then treasure is abus 'd , When misers keep it : being put to loan , In time it will return us two for one . Rich robes themselves and others do adorn ; Neither themselves nor others , if not worn . Who builds a palace , and rams up the gate , Shall see it ruinous and desolate : Ah , simple Hero , learn thyself to cherish ! Lone women , like to empty houses , perish . Less sins the poor rich man , that starves himself In heaping up a mass of drossy pelf , Than such as you : his golden earth remains , Which , after his decease , some other gains ; But this fair gem , sweet in the loss alone , When you fleet hence , can be bequeath 'd to none ; Or , if it could , down from th ’ enamell 'd sky All heaven would come to claim this legacy , And with intestine broils the world destroy , And quite confound Nature 's sweet harmony . Well therefore by the gods decreed it is , We human creatures should enjoy that bliss . One is no number ; maids are nothing , then , Without the sweet society of men . Wilt thou live single still ? one shalt thou be , Though never singling Hymen couple thee . Wild savages , that drink of running springs , Think water far excels all earthly things ; But they , that daily taste neat wine , despise it : Virginity , albeit some highly prize it , Compar 'd with marriage , had you tried them both , Differs as much as wine and water doth . Base bullion for the stamp 's sake we allow : Even so for men 's impression do we you ; By which alone , our reverend fathers say , Women receive perfection every way . This idol , which you term virginity , Is neither essence subject to the eye , No , nor to any one exterior sense , Nor hath it any place of residence , Nor is't of earth or mould celestial , Or capable of any form at all . Of that which hath no being , do not boast : Things that are not at all , are never lost . Men foolishly do call it virtuous : What virtue is it , that is born with us ? Much less can honour be ascrib 'd thereto : Honour is purchas 'd by the deeds we do Believe me , Hero , honour is not won , Until some honourable deed be done . Seek you , for chastity , immortal fame , And know that some have wrong 'd Diana 's name ? Whose name is it , if she be false or not , So she be fair , but some vile tongues will blot ? But you are fair , ay me ! so wondrous fair , So young , so gentle , and so debonair , As Greece will think , if thus you live alone , Some one or other keeps you as his own . Then , Hero , hate me not , nor from me fly , To follow swiftly blasting imfamy . Perhaps thy sacred priesthood makes thee loath : Tell me , to whom mad'st thou that heedless oath ? ” “ To Venus , ” answer 'd she ; and , as she spake , Forth from those two tralucent cisterns brake A stream of liquid pearl , which down her face Made milk-white paths , whereon the gods might trace To Jove 's high court . He thus replied : “ The rites In which love 's beauteous empress most delights , Are banquets , Doric music , midnight revel , Plays , masks , and all that stern age counteth evil . Thee as a holy idiot doth she scorn ; For thou , in vowing chastity , hast sworn To rob her name and honour , and thereby Committ'st a sin far worse than perjury , Even sacrilege against her deity , Through regular and formal purity . To expiate which sin , kiss and shake hands : Such sacrifice as this Venus demands . ” Thereat she smil 'd , and did deny him so , As put thereby , yet might he hope for mo ; Which makes him quickly reinforce his speech , And her in humble manner thus beseech : “ Though neither gods nor men may thee deserve , Yet for her sake , whom you have vow 'd to serve , Abandon fruitless cold virginity . The gentle queen of love 's sole enemy . Then shall you most resemble Venus ’ nun , When Venus ’ sweet rites are perform 'd and done . Flint breasted Pallas joys in single life ; But Pallas and your mistress are at strife . Love , Hero , then , and be not tyrannous ; But heal the heart that thou hast wounded thus ; Nor stain thy youthful years with avarice : Fair fools delight to be accounted nice . The richest corn dies , if it be not reapt ; Beauty alone is lost , too warily kept . ” These arguments he us 'd , and many more ; Wherewith she yielded , that was won before . Hero 's looks yielded , but her words made war : Women are won when they begin to jar . Thus , having swallow 'd Cupid 's golden hook , The more she striv 'd , the deeper was she strook : Yet , evilly feigning anger , strove she still , And would be thought to grant against her will . So having paus 'd a while , at last she said , “ Who taught thee rhetoric to deceive a maid ? Ay me ! such words as these should I abhor , And yet I like them for the orator . ” With that , Leander stoop 'd to have embrac 'd her , But from his spreading arms away she cast her , And thus bespake him : “ Gentle youth , forbear To touch the sacred garments which I wear . Upon a rock , and underneath a hill , Far from the town , ( where all is whist and still , Save that the sea , playing on yellow sand , Sends forth a rattling murmur to the land , Whose sound allures the golden Morpheus In silence of the night to visit us ,) My turret stands ; and there , God knows , I play With Venus ’ swans and sparrows all the day . A dwarfish beldam bears me company , That hops about the chamber where I lie , And spends the night , that might be better spent , In vain discourse and apish merriment :— Come thither . ” As she spake this , her tongue tripp 'd , For unawares , “ Come thither , ” from her slipp 'd ; And suddenly her former colour chang 'd , And here and there her eyes through anger rang 'd ; And , like a planet moving several ways At one self instant , she , poor soul , assays , Loving , not to love at all , and every part Strove to resist the motions of her heart : And hands so pure , so innocent , nay , such As might have made Heaven stoop to have a touch , Did she uphold to Venus , and again Vow 'd spotless chastity ; but all in vain ; Cupid beats down her prayers with his wings ; Her vows about the empty air he flings : All deep enrag 'd , his sinewy bow he bent , And shot a shaft that burning from him went ; Wherewith she strooken , look 'd so dolefully , As made Love sigh to see his tyranny ; And , as she wept , her tears to pearl he turn 'd , And wound them on his arm , and for her mourn 'd . Then towards the palace of the Destinies , Laden with languishment and grief , he flies , And to those stern nymphs humbly made request , Both might enjoy each other , and be blest . But with a ghastly dreadful countenance , Threatening a thousand deaths at every glance , They answer 'd Love , nor would vouchsafe so much As one poor word , their hate to him was such : Hearken a while , and I will tell you why . Heaven 's winged herald , Jove-born Mercury , The self-same day that he asleep had laid Enchanted Argus , spied a country maid , Whose careless hair , instead of pearl t'adorn it , Glister 'd with dew , as one that seem 'd to scorn it ; Her breath as fragrant as the morning rose ; Her mind pure , and her tongue untaught to glose : Yet proud she was ( for lofty Pride that dwells In towered courts , is oft in shepherds ’ cells ) , And too-too well the fair vermilion knew And silver tincture of her cheeks , that drew The love of every swain . On her this god Enamour 'd was , and with his snaky rod Did charm her nimble feet , and made her stay , The while upon a hillock down he lay , And sweetly on his pipe began to play , And with smooth speech her fancy to assay , Till in his twining arms her lock 'd her fast , And then he woo 'd with kisses ; and at last , As shepherds do , her on the ground he laid , And , tumbling in the grass , he often stray 'd Beyond the bounds of shame , in being bold To eye those parts which no eye should behold ; And , like an insolent commanding lover , Boasting his parentage , would needs discover The way to new Elysium . But she , Whose only dower was her chastity , Having striven in vain , was now about to cry , And crave the help of shepherds that were nigh . Herewith he stay 'd his fury , and began To give her leave to rise : away she ran ; After went Mercury , who us 'd such cunning , As she , to hear his tale , left off her running ; ( Maids are not won by brutish force and might But speeches full of pleasure , and delight ;) And , knowing Hermes courted her , was glad That she such loveliness and beauty had As could provoke his liking ; yet was mute , And neither would deny nor grant his suit . Still vow 'd he love : she , wanting no excuse To feed him with delays , as women use , Or thirsting after immortality , ( All women are ambitious naturally ,) Impos 'd upon her lover such a task , As he ought not perform , nor yet she ask ; A draught of flowing nectar she requested , Wherewith the king of gods and men is feasted . He , ready to accomplish what she will 'd , Stole some from Hebe ( Hebe Jove 's cup fill 'd ) , And gave it to his simple rustic love : Which being known ,— as what is hid from Jove ?— He inly storm 'd , and wax 'd more furious Than for the fire filch 'd by Prometheus ; And thrusts him down from heaven . He , wandering here , In mournful terms , with sad and heavy cheer , Complain 'd to Cupid : Cupid , for his sake , To be reveng 'd on Jove did undertake ; And those on whom heaven , earth , and hell relies , I mean the adamantine Destinies , He wounds with love , and forc 'd them equally To dote upon deceitful Mercury . They offer 'd him the deadly fatal knife That shears the slender threads of human life ; At his fair feather 'd feet the engines laid , Which th ’ earth from ugly Chaos ’ den upweigh 'd . These he regarded not ; but did entreat That Jove , usurper of his father 's seat , Might presently be banish 'd into hell , And aged Saturn in Olympus dwell . They granted what he crav 'd ; and once again Saturn and Ops began their golden reign : Murder , rape , war , and lust , and treachery , Were with Jove clos 'd in Stygian empery . But long this blessed time continu 'd not : As soon as he his wished purpose got , He , reckless of his promise , did despise The love of th ’ everlasting Destinies . They , seeing it , both Love and him abhorr 'd , And Jupiter unto his place restor 'd : And , but that learning , in despite of Fate , Will amount aloft , and enter heaven-gate , And to the seat of Jove itself advance , Hermes had slept in hell with Ignorance . Yet , as a punishment , they added this , That he and Poverty should always kiss And to this day is every scholar poor : Gross gold from them runs headlong to the boor . Likewise the angry Sisters , thus deluded , To venge themselves on Hermes , have concluded That Midas ’ brood shall sit in Honour 's chair , To which the Muses ’ sons are only heir ; And fruitful wits , that inaspiring are , Shall discontent run into regions far ; And few great lords in virtuous deeds shall joy But be surpris 'd with every garish toy , And still enrich the lofty servile clown , Who with encroaching guile keeps learning down . Then muse not Cupid 's suit no better sped , Seeing in their loves the Fates were injured . THE SECOND SESTIAD THE ARGUMENT OF THE SECOND SESTIAD Hero of love takes deeper sense , And doth her love more recompense : Their first night 's meeting , where sweet kisses Are th ’ only crowns of both their blisses . He swims t ’ Abydos , and returns : Cold Neptune with his beauty burns ; Whose suit he shuns , and doth aspire Hero 's fair tower and his desire . By this , sad Hero , with love unacquainted , Viewing Leander 's face , fell down and fainted . He kiss 'd her , and breath 'd life into her lips ; Wherewith , as one displeas 'd , away she trips ; Yet , as she went , full often look 'd behind , And many poor excuses did she find To linger by the way , and once she stay 'd , And would have turn 'd again , but was afraid , In offering parley , to be counted light : So on she goes , and , in her idle flight , Her painted fan of curled plumes let fall , Thinking to train Leander therewithal . He , being a novice , knew not what she meant , But stay 'd , and after her a letter sent ; Which joyful Hero answer 'd in such sort , As he had hoped to scale the beauteous fort Wherein the liberal Graces lock 'd their wealth ; And therefore to her tower he got by stealth . Wide-open stood the door ; he need not climb ; And she herself , before the pointed time , Had spread the board , with roses strew 'd the room , And oft look 'd out , and mus 'd he did not come . At last he came : O , who can tell the greeting These greedy lovers had at their first meeting ? He ask 'd ; she gave ; and nothing was denied ; Both to each other quickly were affied : Look how their hands , so were their hearts united , And what he did , she willingly requited . ( Sweet are the kisses , the embracements sweet , When like desires and like affections meet ; For from the earth to heaven is Cupid rais 'd , Where fancy is in equal balance pais 'd . ) Yet she this rashness suddenly repented , And turn 'd aside , and to herself lamented , As if her name and honour had been wrong 'd , By being possess 'd of him for whom she long 'd ; Ay , and she wish 'd , albeit not from her heart , That he would leave her turret and depart . The mirthful god of amorous pleasure smil 'd To see how he this captive nymph beguil 'd ; For hitherto he did but fan the fire , And kept it down , that it might mount the higher . Now wax 'd she jealous lest his love abated , Fearing her own thoughts made her to be hated . Therefore unto him hastily she goes , And , like light Salmacis , her body throws Upon his bosom , where with yielding eyes She offers up herself a sacrifice To slake his anger , if he were displeas 'd : O , what god would not therewith be appeas 'd ? Like Æsop 's cock , this jewel he enjoy 'd , And as a brother with his sister toy 'd , Supposing nothing else was to be done , Now he her favour and goodwill had won . But know you not that creatures wanting sense , By nature have a mutual appetence , And , wanting organs to advance a step , Mov 'd by love 's force , unto each other lep ? Much more in subjects having intellect Some hidden influence breeds like effect . Albeit Leander , rude in love and raw , Long dallying with Hero , nothing saw That might delight him more , yet he suspected Some amorous rites or other were neglected . Therefore unto his body hers he clung : She , fearing on the rushes to be flung , Striv 'd with redoubled strength ; the more she striv 'd , The more a gentle pleasing heat reviv 'd , Which taught him all that elder lovers know ; And now the same gan so to scorch and glow , As in plain terms , yet cunningly , he crave it : Love always makes those eloquent that have it . She , with a kind of granting , put him by it , And ever , as he thought himself most nigh it , Like to the tree of Tantalus , she fled , And , seeming lavish , sav 'd her maidenhead . Ne'er king more sought to keep his diadem , Than Hero this inestimable gem : Above our life we love a steadfast friend ; Yet when a token of great worth we send , We often kiss it , often look thereon , And stay the messenger that would be gone ; No marvel , then , though Hero would not yield So soon to part from that she dearly held : Jewels being lost are found again ; this never ; ‘ Tis lost but once , and once lost , lost for ever . Now had the Morn espied her lover 's steeds ; Whereat she starts , puts on her purple weeds , And , red for anger that he stay 'd so long , All headlong throws herself the clouds among . And now Leander , fearing to be miss 'd , Embrac 'd her suddenly , took leave , and kiss 'd : Long was he taking leave , and loathe to go , And kiss 'd again , as lovers use to do . Sad Hero wrung him by the hand , and wept , Saying , “ Let your vows and promises be kept ": Then standing at the door , she turn 'd about , As loathe to see Leander going out . And now the sun , that through th ’ horizon peeps , As pitying these lovers , downward creeps ; So that in silence of the cloudy night , Though it was morning , did he take his flight . But what the secret trusty night conceal 'd , Leander 's amorous habit soon reveal 'd : With Cupid 's myrtle was his bonnet crown 'd , About his arms the purple riband wound , Wherewith she wreath 'd her largely-spreading hair ; Nor could the youth abstain , but he must wear The sacred ring wherewith she was endow 'd , When first religious chastity she vow 'd ; Which made his love through Sestos to be known , And thence unto Abydos sooner blown Than he could sail ; for incorporeal Fame , Whose weight consists in nothing but her name , Is swifter than the wind , whose tardy plumes Are reeking water and dull earthly fumes . Home when he came , he seem 'd not to be there , But , like exiled air thrust from his sphere , Set in a foreign place ; and straight from thence , Alcides-like , by mighty violence , He would have chas 'd away the swelling main , That him from her unjustly did detain . Like as the sun in a diameter Fires and inflames objects removed far , And heateth kindly , shining laterally ; So beauty sweetly quickens when ‘ tis nigh , But being separated and remov 'd , Burns where it cherish 'd , murders where it lov 'd . Therefore even as an index to a book , So to his mind was young Leander 's look . O , none but gods have power their love to hide ! Affection by the countenance is descried ; The light of hidden fire itself discovers , And love that is conceal 'd betrays poor lovers . His secret flame apparently was seen : Leander 's father knew where he had been , And for the same mildly rebuk 'd his son , Thinking to quench the sparkles new-begun . But love resisted once , grows passionate , And nothing more than counsel lovers hate ; For as a hot proud horse highly disdains To have his head controll 'd , but breaks the reins , Spits forth the ringled bit , and with his hoves Checks the submissive ground ; so he that loves , The more he is restrain 'd , the worse he fares : What is it now but mad Leander dares ? “ O Hero , Hero ! ” thus he cried full oft ; And then he got him to a rock aloft , Where having spied her tower , long star 'd he o n't , And pray 'd the narrow toiling Hellespont To part in twain , that he might come and go ; But still the rising billows answer 'd , “ No . ” With that , he stripp 'd him to the ivory skin , And , crying , “ Love , I come , ” leap 'd lively in : Whereat the sapphire-visag 'd god grew proud , And made his capering Triton sound aloud , Imagining that Ganymede , displeas 'd , Had left the heavens ; therefore on him he seiz 'd . Leander striv 'd ; the waves about him wound , And pull 'd him to the bottom , where the ground Was strew 'd with pearl , and in low coral groves Sweet-singing mermaids sported with their loves On heaps of heavy gold , and took great pleasure To spurn in careless sort the shipwreck treasure ; For here the stately azure palace stood , Where kingly Neptune and his train abode . The lusty god embrac 'd him , call 'd him “ love , ” And swore he never should return to Jove : But when he knew it was not Ganymed , For under water he was almost dead , He heav 'd him up , and , looking on his face , Beat down the bold waves with his triple mace , Which mounted up , intending to have kiss 'd him . And fell in drops like tears because they miss 'd him . Leander , being up , began to swim , And , looking back , saw Neptune follow him : Whereat aghast , the poor soul gan to cry , “ O , let me visit Hero ere I die ! ” The god put Helle 's bracelet on his arm , And swore the sea should never do him harm . He clapp 'd his plump cheeks , with his tresses play 'd , And , smiling wantonly , his love bewray 'd ; He watch 'd his arms , and , as they open 'd wide At every stroke , betwixt them would he slide , And steal a kiss , and then run out and dance , And , as he turn 'd , cast many a lustful glance , And throw him gaudy toys to please his eye , And dive into the water , and there pry Upon his breast , his thighs , and every limb , And up again , and close beside him swim , And talk of love . Leander made reply , “ You are deceiv 'd ; I am no woman , I . ” Thereat smil 'd Neptune , and then told a tale , How that a shepherd , sitting in a vale , Play 'd with a boy so lovely-fair and kind , As for his love both earth and heaven pin 'd ; That of the cooling river durst not drink , Lest water-nymphs should pull him from the brink ; And when he sported in the fragrant lawns , Goat-footed Satyrs and up-staring Fauns Would steal him thence . Ere half this tale was done , “ Ay me , ” Leander cried , “ th ’ enamour 'd sun , That now should shine on Thetis ’ glassy bower , Descends upon my radiant Hero 's tower : O , that these tardy arms of mine were wings ! ” And , as he spake , upon the waves he springs . Neptune was angry that he gave no ear , And in his heart revenging malice bare : He flung at him his mace ; but , as it went , He call 'd it in , for love made him repent : The mace , returning back , his own hand hit , As meaning to be veng 'd for darting it . When this fresh-bleeding wound Leander view 'd , His colour went and came , as if he ru 'd The grief which Neptune felt : in gentle breasts Relenting thoughts , remorse , and pity rests ; And who have hard hearts and obdurate minds , But vicious , hare-brain 'd , and illiterate hinds ? The god , seeing him with pity to be mov 'd , Thereon concluded that he was belov 'd ; ( Love is too full of faith , too credulous , With folly and false hope deluding us ;) Wherefore , Leander 's fancy to surprise , To the rich ocean for gifts he flies ; ‘ Tis wisdom to give much ; a gilt prevails When deep-persuading oratory fails . By this , Leander , being near the land , Cast down his weary feet , and felt the sand . Breathless albeit he were , he rested not Till to the solitary tower he got ; And knock 'd , and call 'd : at which celestial noise The longing heart of Hero much more joys , Than nymphs and shepherds when the timbrel rings , Or crooked dolphin when the sailor sings . She stay 'd not for her robes , but straight arose , And , drunk with gladness , to the door she goes ; Where seeing a naked man , she screech 'd for fear , ( Such sights as this to tender maids are rare ,) And ran into the dark herself to hide ( Rich jewels in the dark are soonest spied ) . Unto her was he led , or rather drawn By those white limbs which sparkled through the lawn . The nearer that he came , the more she fled , And , seeking refuge , slipt into her bed ; Whereon Leander sitting , thus began , Through numbing cold , all feeble , faint , and wan . “ If not for love , yet , love , for pity-sake , Me in thy bed and maiden bosom take ; At least vouchsafe these arms some little room , Who , hoping to embrace thee , cheerly swoom : This head was beat with many a churlish billow , And therefore let it rest upon thy pillow . ” Herewith affrighted , Hero shrunk away , And in her lukewarm place Leander lay ; Whose lively heat , like fire from heaven fet , Would animate gross clay , and higher set The drooping thoughts of base-declining souls , Than dreary-Mars-carousing nectar bowls . His hands he cast upon her like a snare : She , overcome with shame and sallow fear , Like chaste Diana when Actæon spied her , Being suddenly betray 'd , div 'd down to hide her ; And , as her silver body downward went , With both her hands she made the bed a tent , And in her own mind thought herself secure , O'ercast with dim and darksome coverture . And now she lets him whisper in her ear , Flatter , entreat , promise , protest , and swear : Yet ever , as he greedily assay 'd To touch those dainties , she the harpy play 'd , And every limb did , as a soldier stout , Defend the fort , and keep the foeman out ; For though the rising ivory mount he scal 'd , Which is with azure circling lines empal 'd . Much like a globe ( a globe may I term this , By which Love sails to regions full of bliss ,) Yet there with Sisyphus he toil 'd in vain , Till gentle parley did the truce obtain . Even as a bird , which in our hands we wring , Forth plungeth , and oft flutters with her wing , She trembling strove : this strife of hers , like that Which made the world , another world begat Of unknown joy . Treason was in her thought , And cunningly to yield herself she sought . Seeming not won , yet won she was at length : In such wars women use but half their strength . Leander now , like Theban Hercules , Enter 'd the orchard of th ’ Hesperides ; Whose fruit none rightly can describe , but he That pulls or shakes it from the golden tree . Wherein Leander , on her quivering breast , Breathless spoke something , and sigh 'd out the rest ; Which so prevail 'd , as he , with small ado , Enclos 'd her in his arms , and kiss 'd her too : And every kiss to her was as a charm , And to Leander as a fresh alarm : So that the truce was broke , and she , alas , Poor silly maiden , at his mercy was . Love is not full of pity , as men say , But deaf and cruel where he means to prey . And now she wish 'd this night were never done , And sigh 'd to think upon th ’ approaching sun ; For much it griev 'd her that the bright day-light Should know the pleasure of this blessed night , And them , like Mars and Erycine , display Both in each other 's arms chain 'd as they lay . Again , she knew not how to frame her look , Or speak to him , who in a moment took That which so long , so charily she kept ; And fain by stealth away she would have crept , And to some corner secretly have gone , Leaving Leander in the bed alone . But as her naked feet were whipping out , He on the sudden cling 'd her so about , That , mermaid-like , unto the floor she slid ; One half appear 'd the other half was hid . Thus near the bed she blushing stood upright , And from her countenance behold ye might A kind of twilight break , which through the air , As from an orient cloud , glimps 'd here and there ; And round about the chamber this false morn Brought forth the day before the day was born . So Hero 's ruddy cheek Hero betray 'd , And her all naked to his sight display 'd : Whence his admiring eyes more pleasure took Than Dis , on heaps of gold fixing his look . By this , Apollo 's golden harp began To sound forth music to the ocean ; Which watchful Hesperus no sooner heard , But he the bright Day-bearing car prepar 'd , And ran before , as harbinger of light , And with his flaring beams mock 'd ugly Night Till she , o'ercome with anguish , shame , and rage , Dang 'd down to hell her loathsome carriage . Here Marlowe 's work ends . The rest of the poem is by Chapman . THE THIRD SESTIAD THE ARGUMENT OF THE THIRD SESTIAD Leander to the envious light Resigns his night-sports with the night , And swims the Hellespont again . Thesme , the deity sovereign Of customs and religious rites , Appears , reproving his delights , Since nuptial honours he neglected ; Which straight he vows shall be effected . Fair Hero , left devirginate , Weighs , and with fury wails her state : But with her love and woman 's wit She argues and approveth it . New light gives new directions , fortunes new To fashion our endeavours that ensue . More harsh , at least more hard , more grave and high Our subject runs , and our stern Muse must fly . Love 's edge is taken off , and that light flame , Those thoughts , joys , longings , that before became High unexperienc 'd blood , and maids ’ sharp plights , Must now grow staid , and censure the delights , That , being enjoy 'd , ask judgment ; now we praise , As having parted : evenings crown the days . And now , ye wanton Loves , and young Desires , Pied Vanity , the mint of strange attires , Ye lisping Flatteries , and obsequious Glances , Relentful Musics , and attractive Dances , And you detested Charms constraining love ! Shun love 's stoln sports by that these lovers prove . By this , the sovereign of heaven 's golden fires , And young Leander , lord of his desires , Together from their lover 's arms arose : Leander into Hellespontus throws His Hero-handled body , whose delight Made him disdain each other epithite . And so amidst th ’ enamour 'd waves he swims , The god of gold of purpose gilt his limbs , That , this word gilt including double sense , The double guilt of his incontinence Might be express 'd , that had no stay t ’ employ The tresure which the love-god let him joy In his dear Hero , with such sacred thrift As had beseem 'd so sanctified a gift ; But , like a greedy vulgar prodigal , Would on the stock dispend , and rudely fall , Before his time , to that unblessed blessing Which , for lust 's plague , doth perish with possessing : Joy graven in sense , like snow in water , wasts ; Without preserve of virtue , nothing lasts . What man is he , that with a wealthy eye Enjoys a beauty richer than the sky , Through whose white skin , softer than soundest sleep , With damask eyes the ruby blood doth peep , And runs in branches through her azure veins , Whose mixture and first fire his love attains ; Whose both hands limit both love 's deities , And sweeten human thoughts like paradise ; Whose disposition silken and is kind , Directed with an earth-exempted mind ;— Who thinks not heaven with such a love is given ? And who , like earth , would spend that dower of heaven , With rank desire to joy it all at first ? What simply kills our hunger , quencheth thirst , Clothes but our nakedness , and makes us live , Praise doth not any of her favours give : But what doth plentifully minister Beauteous apparel and delicious cheer , So order 'd that it still excites desire , And still gives pleasure freeness to aspire , The palm of Bounty ever moist preserving ; To Love 's sweet life this is the courtly carving . Thus Time and all-states-ordering Ceremony Had banish 'd all offence : Time 's golden thigh Upholds the flowery body of the earth In sacred harmony , and every birth Of men and actions makes legitimate ; Being us 'd aright , the use of time is fate . Yet did the gentle flood transfer once more This prize of love home to his father 's shore , Where he unlades himself of that false wealth That makes few rich ,— treasures compos 'd by stealth ; And to his sister , kind Hermione , ( Who on the shore kneel 'd , praying to the sea For his return ,) he all love 's goods did show , In Hero seis 'd for him , in him for Hero . His most kind sister all his secrets knew , And to her , singing , like a shower , he flew , Sprinkling the earth , that to their tombs took in Streams dead for love , to leave his ivory skin , Which yet a snowy foam did leave above , As soul to the dead water that did love ; And from thence did the first white roses spring ( For love is sweet and fair in every thing ) , And all the sweeten 'd shore , as he did go , Was crown 'd with odorous roses , white as snow . Love-blest Leander was with love so fill 'd , That love to all that touch 'd him he instill 'd ; And as the colours of all things we see , To our sight 's powers communicated be , So to all objects that in compass came Of any sense he had , his senses ’ flame Flow 'd from his parts with force so virtual , It fir 'd with sense things mere insensual . Now , with warm baths and odours comforted , When he lay down , he kindly kiss 'd his bed , As consecrating it to Hero 's right , And vow 'd thererafter , that whatever sight Put him in mind of Hero or her bliss , Should be her altar to prefer a kiss . Then laid he forth his late-enriched arms , In whose white circle Love writ all his charms , And made his characters sweet Hero 's limbs , When on his breast 's warm sea she sideling swims ; And as those arms , held up in circle , met , He said , “ See , sister , Hero 's carquenet ! Which she had rather wear about her neck , Than all the jewels that do Juno deck . ” But , as he shook with passionate desire To put in flame his other secret fire , A music so divine did pierce his ear , As never yet his ravish 'd sense did hear ; When suddenly a light of twenty hues Brake through the roof , and , like the rainbow , views Amaz 'd Leander : in whose beams came down The goddess Ceremony , with a crown Of all the stars ; and Heaven with her descended : Her flaming hair to her bright feet extended , By which hung all the bench of deities ; And in a chain , compact of ears and eyes , She led Religion : all her body was Clear and transparent as the purest glass , For she was all presented to the sense : Devotion , Order , State , and Reverence , Her shadows were ; Society , Memory ; All which her sight made live , her absence die . A rich disparent pentacle she wears , Drawn full of circles and strange characters . Her face was changeable to every eye ; One way look 'd ill , another graciously ; Which while men view 'd , they cheerful were and holy , But looking off , vicious and melancholy . The snaky paths to each observed law Did Policy in her broad bosom draw . One hand a mathematic crystal sways , Which , gathering in one line a thousand rays From her bright eyes , Confusion burns to death , And all estates of men distinguisheth : By it Morality and Comeliness Themselves in all their sightly figures dress . Her other hand a laurel rod applies , To beat back Barbarism and Avarice , That follow 'd , eating earth and excrement And human limbs ; and would make proud ascent To seats of gods , were Ceremony slain . The Hours and Graces bore her glorious train ; And all the sweets of our society Were spher 'd and treasur 'd in her bounteous eye . Thus she appear 'd , and sharply did reprove Leander 's bluntness in his violent love ; Told him how poor was substance without rites , Like bills unsign 'd ; desires without delights ; Like meats unseason 'd ; like rank corn that grows On cottages , that none or reaps or sows ; Not being with civil forms confirm 'd and bounded , For human dignities and comforts founded ; But loose and secret all their glories hide ; Fear fills the chamber , Darkness decks the bride . She vanish 'd , leaving pierc 'd Leander 's heart With sense of his unceremonious part , In which , with plain neglect of nuptial rites , He close and flatly fell to his delights : And instantly he vow 'd to celebrate All rites pertaining to his married state . So up he gets , and to his father goes , To whose glad ears he doth his vows disclose . The nuptials are resolv 'd with utmost power ; And he at night would swim to Hero 's tower , From whence he meant to Sestos ’ forked bay To bring her covertly , where ships must stay , Sent by his father , throughly rigg 'd and mann 'd , To waft her safely to Abydos ’ strand . There leave we him ; and with fresh wing pursue Astonish 'd Hero , whose most wished view I thus long have forborne , because I left her So out of countenance , and her spirits bereft her : To look of one abashed is impudence , When of slight faults he hath too deep a sense . Her blushing het her chamber : she look 'd out , And all the air she purpled round about ; And after it a foul black day befell , Which ever since a red morn doth foretell , And still renews our woes for Hero 's woe ; And foul it prov 'd , because it figur 'd so The next night 's horror ; which prepare to hear ; I fail , if it profane your daintiest ear . Then , ho , most strangely-intellectual fire , That , proper to my soul , hast power t'inspire Her burning faculties , and with the wings Of thy unsphered flame visit'st the springs Of spirits immortal ! Now ( as swift as Time Doth follow Motion ) find th ’ eternal clime Of his free soul , whose living subject stood Up to the chin in the Pierian flood , And drunk to me half this Musæan story , Inscribing it to deathless memory : Confer with it , and make my pledge as deep , That neither 's draught be consecrate to sleep ; Tell it how much his late desires I tender ( If yet it know not ) , and to light surrender My soul 's dark offspring , willing it should die To loves , to passions , and society . Sweet Hero , left upon her bed alone , Her maidenhead , her vows , Leander gone , And nothing with her but a violent crew Of new-come thoughts , that yet she never knew , Even to herself a stranger , was much like Th ’ Iberian city that War 's hand did strike By English force in princely Essex ’ guide , When Peace assur 'd her towers had fortified , And golden-finger 'd India had bestow 'd Such wealth on her , that strength and empire flow 'd Into her turrets , and her virgin waist The wealthy girdle of the sea embrac 'd ; Till our Leander , that made Mars his Cupid , For soft love suits with iron thunders chid ; Swum to her town , dissolv 'd her virgin zone ; Led in his power , and made Confusion Run through her streets amaz 'd , that she suppos 'd She had not been in her own walls enclosed , But rapt by wonder to some foreign state , Seeing all her issue so disconsolate , And all her peaceful mansions possess 'd With war 's just spoil , and many a foreign guest From every corner driving an enjoyer , Supplying it with power of a destroyer . So far 'd fair Hero in th ’ expugned fort Of her chaste bosom ; and of every sort Strange thoughts possess 'd her , ransacking her breast For that that was not there , her wonted rest . She was a mother straight , and bore with pain Thoughts that spake straight , and wish 'd their mother slain ; She hates their lives , and they their own and hers : Such strife still grows where sin the race prefers : Love is a golden bubble , full of dreams , That waking breaks , and fills us with extremes . She mus 'd how she could look upon her sire , And not show that without , that was intire ; For as a glass is an inanimate eye , And outward forms embraceth inwardly , So is the eye an animate glass , that shows In forms without us ; and as Ph  bus throws His beams abroad , though he in clouds be clos 'd , Still glancing by them till he find oppos 'd A loose and rorid vapour that is fit T ’ event his searching beams , and useth it To form a tender twenty-colour 'd eye , Cast in a circle round about the sky ; So when our fiery soul , our body 's star , ( That ever is in motion circular ,) Conceives a form , in seeking to display it Through all our cloudy parts , it doth convey it Forth at the eye , as the most pregnant place , And that reflects it round about the face . And this event , uncourtly Hero thought , Her inward guilt would in her looks have wrought ; For yet the world 's stale cunning she resisted , To bear foul thoughts , yet forge what looks she listed , And held it for a very silly sleight , To make a perfect metal counterfeit . Glad to disclaim herself , proud of an art That makes the face a pandar to the heart . Those be the painted moons , whose lights profane Beauty 's true heaven , at full still in their wane ; Those be the lapwing faces that still cry , “ Here ‘ tis ! ” when that they vow is nothing nigh : Base fools ! when every moorish fool can teach That which men think the height of human reach . But custom , that the apoplexy is Of bed-rid nature and lives led amiss , And takes away all feeling of offence , Yet braz 'd not Hero 's brow with impudence ; And this she thought most hard to bring to pass , To seem in countenance other than she was , As if she had two souls , one for the face , One for the heart , and that they shifted place As either list to utter or conceal What they conceiv 'd , or as one soul did deal With both affairs at once , keeps and ejects Both at an instant contrary effects ; Retention and ejection in her powers Being acts alike ; for this one vice of ours , That forms the thought , and sways the countenance , Rules both our motion and our utterance . These and more grave conceits toil 'd Hero 's spirits ; For , though the light of her discoursive wits Perhaps might find some little hole to pass Through all these worldly cinctures , yet , alas ! There was a heavenly flame encompass 'd her ,— Her goddess , in whose fane she did prefer Her virgin vows , from whose impulsive sight She knew the black shield of the darkest night Could not defend her , nor wit 's subtlest art : This was the point pierc 'd Hero to the heart ; Who , heavy to the death , with a deep sigh , And hand that languish 'd , took a robe was nigh , Exceeding large , and of black cypress made , In which she sate , hid from the day in shade , Even over head and face , down to her feet ; Her left hand made it at her bosom meet , Her right hand lean 'd on her heart-bowing knee , Wrapp 'd in unshapeful folds , ‘ twas death to see ; Her knee stay 'd that , and that her falling face ; Each limb help 'd other to put on disgrace : No form was seen , where form held all her sight ; But , like an embryon that saw never light , Or like a scorched statue made a coal With three-wing 'd lightning , or a wretched soul Muffled with endless darkness , she did sit : The night had never such a heavy spirit . Yet might a penetrating eye well see How fast her clear tears melted on her knee Through her black veil , and turn 'd as black as it , Mourning to be her tears . Then wrought her wit With her broke vow , her goddess ’ wrath , her fame ,— All tools that enginous despair could frame : Which made her strew the floor with her torn hair , And spread her mantle piece-meal in the air . Like Jove 's son 's club , strong passion struck her down And with a piteous shriek enforc 'd her swoun : Her shriek made with another shriek ascend The frighted matron that on her did tend ; And as with her own cry her sense was slain , So with the other it was call 'd again . She rose , and to her bed made forced way , And laid her down even where Leander lay ; And all this while the red sea of her blood Ebb 'd with Leander : but now turn 'd the flood , And all her fleet of spirits came swelling in , With child of sail , and did hot fight begin With those severe conceits she too much mark 'd : And here Leander 's beauties were embark 'd . He came in swimming , painted all with joys , Such as might sweeten hell : his thought destroys All her destroying thoughts ; she thought she felt His heart in hers , with her contentions melt , And chide her soul that it could so much err , To check the true joys he deserv 'd in her . Her fresh heat-blood cast figures in her eyes , And she suppos 'd she saw in Neptune 's skies How her star wander 'd , wash 'd in smarting brine , For her love 's sake , that with immortal wine Should be embath 'd , and swim in more heart'shYpppHeNease Than there was water in the Sestian seas . Then said her Cupid-prompted spirit : “ Shall I Sing moans to such delightsome harmony ? Shall slick-tongu 'd Fame , patch 'd up with voices rude , The drunken bastard of the multitude , ( Begot when father Judgment is away , And , gossip-like , says because others say , Takes news as if it were too hot to eat , And spits it slavering forth for dog-fees meat ,) Make me , for forging a fantastic vow , Presume to bear what makes grave matrons bow ? Good vows are never broken with good deeds , For then good deeds were bad : vows are but seeds , And good deeds fruits ; even those good deeds that grow From other stocks than from th ’ observed vow . That is a good deed that prevents a bad ; Had I not yielded , slain myself I had . Hero Leander is , Leander Hero ; Such virtue love hath to make one of two . If , then , Leander did my maidenhead git , Leander being myself , I still retain it : We break chaste vows when we live loosely ever , But bound as we are , we live loosely never : Two constant lovers being join 'd in one , Yielding to one another , yield to none . We know not how to vow till love unblind us , And vows made ignorantly nerver bind us . Too true it is , that , when ‘ tis gone , men hate The joys as vain they took in love 's estate : But that 's since they have lost the heavenly light Should show them way to judge of all things right . When life is gone , death must implant his terror : As death is foe to life , so love to error . Before we love , how range we through this sphere , Searching the sundry fancies hunted here ! Now with desire of wealth transported quite Beyond our free humanity 's delight ; Now with ambition climbing falling towers , Whose hope to scale , our fear to fall devours ; Now rapt with pastimes , pomp , all joys impure : In things without us no delight is sure . But love , with all joys crown 'd , within doth sit : O goddess , pity love , and pardon it ! ” Thus spake she weeping : but her goddess ’ ear Burn 'd with too stern a heat , and would not hear . Ay me ! hath heaven 's strait fingers no more graces For such as Hero than for homeliest faces ? Yet she hop 'd well , and in her sweet conceit Weighing her arguments , she thought them weight , And that the logic of Leander 's beauty , And them together , would bring proofs of duty ; And if her soul , that was a skillful glance Of heaven 's great essence , found such imperance In her love 's beauties , she had confidence Jove lov 'd him too , and pardon 'd her offence : Beauty in heaven and earth this grace doth win , It supples rigour , and it lessens sin . Thus , her sharp wit , her love , her secrecy , Trooping together , made her wonder why She should not leave her bed , and to the temple ; Her health said she must live ; her sex , dissemble . She view 'd Leander 's place , and wish 'd he were Turn 'd to his place , so his place were Leander . “ Ay me , ” said she , “ that love 's sweet life and sense Should do it harm ! my love had not gone hence , Had he been like his place : O blessed place , Image of constancy ! Thus my love 's grace Parts nowhere , but it leaves something behind Worth observation : he renowns his kind : His motion is , like heaven 's , orbicular , For where he once is , he is ever there . This place was mine ; Leander , now ‘ tis thine , Thou being myself , then it is double mine , Mine , and Leander 's mine , Leander 's mine . O , see what wealth it yields me , nay , yields him ! For I am in it , he for me doth swim . Rich , fruitful love , that , doubling self estates , Elixir-like contracts , though separates ! Dear place , I kiss thee , and do welcome thee , As from Leander ever sent to me . ”</titlePart></docTitle>

       <l n="13">Venus , to wreak her rites ’ abuses ,</l>
       <l n="14">Creates the monster Eronusis ,</l>
       <l n="15">Inflaming Hero 's sacrifice</l>
       <l n="16">With lightning darted from her eyes ;</l>
       <l n="17">And thereof springs the painted beast</l>
       <l n="18">That ever since taints every breast .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="19">Now from Leander 's place she rose , and found</l>
       <l n="20">Her hair and rent robe scatter 'd on the ground ;</l>
       <l n="21">Which taking up , she every piece did lay</l>
       <l n="22">Upon an altar , where in youth of day</l>
       <l n="23">She us 'd t ’ exhibit private sacrifice :</l>
       <l n="24">Those would she offer to the deities</l>
       <l n="25">Of her fair goddess and her powerful son ,</l>
       <l n="26">As relics of her late-felt passion ;</l>
       <l n="27">And in that holy sort she vow 'd to end them ,</l>
       <l n="28">In hope her violent fancies , that did rend them ,</l>
       <l n="29">Would as quite fade in her love 's holy fire ,</l>
       <l n="30">As they should in the flames she meant t ’ inspire .</l>
       <l n="31">Then she put on all her religious weeds ,</l>
       <l n="32">That deck 'd her in her secret sacred deeds ;</l>
       <l n="33">A crown of icicles , that sun nor fire</l>
       <l n="34">Could ever melt , and figur 'd chaste desire ;</l>
       <l n="35">A golden star shin 'd in her naked breast ,</l>
       <l n="36">In honour of the queen-light of the east .</l>
       <l n="37">In her right hand she held a silver wand ,</l>
       <l n="38">On whose bright top Peristera did stand ,</l>
       <l n="39">Who was a nymph , but now transform 'd a dove ,</l>
       <l n="40">And in her life was dear in Venus ’ love ;</l>
       <l n="41">And for her sake she ever since that time</l>
       <l n="42">Choos 'd doves to draw her coach through heaven 's blue clime .</l>
       <l n="43">Her plenteous hair in curled billows swims</l>
       <l n="44">On her bright shoulder : her harmonious limbs</l>
       <l n="45">Sustain 'd no more but a most subtile veil ,</l>
       <l n="46">That hung on them , as it durst not assail</l>
       <l n="47">Their different concord ; for the weakest air</l>
       <l n="48">Could raise it swelling from her beauties fair ;</l>
       <l n="49">Nor did it cover , but adumbrate only</l>
       <l n="50">Her most heart-piercing parts , that a blest eye</l>
       <l n="51">Might see , as it did shadow , fearfully ,</l>
       <l n="52">All that all-love-deserving paradise :</l>
       <l n="53">It was as blue as the most freezing skies ;</l>
       <l n="54">Near the sea 's hue , for thence her goddess came :</l>
       <l n="55">On it a scarf she wore of wondrous frame ;</l>
       <l n="56">In midst whereof she wrought a virgin 's face ,</l>
       <l n="57">From whose each cheek a fiery blush did chase</l>
       <l n="58">Two crimson flames , that did two ways extend ,</l>
       <l n="59">Spreading the ample scarf to either end ;</l>
       <l n="60">Which figur 'd the division of her mind ,</l>
       <l n="61">Whiles yet she rested bashfully inclined ,</l>
       <l n="62">And stood not resolute to wed Leander ;</l>
       <l n="63">This serv 'd her white neck for a purple sphere ,</l>
       <l n="64">And cast itself at full breadth down her back :</l>
       <l n="65">There , since the first breath that begun the wrack</l>
       <l n="66">Of her free quiet from Leander 's lips ,</l>
       <l n="67">She wrought a sea , in one flame , full of ships ;</l>
       <l n="68">But that one ship where all her wealth did pass ,</l>
       <l n="69">Like simple merchants ’ goods , Leander was ;</l>
       <l n="70">For in that sea she naked figur 'd him ;</l>
       <l n="71">Her diving needle taught him how to swim ,</l>
       <l n="72">And to each thread did such resemblance give ,</l>
       <l n="73">For joy to be so like him it did live :</l>
       <l n="74">Things senseless live by art , and rational die</l>
       <l n="75">By rude contempt of art and industry .</l>
       <l n="76">Scarce could she work , but , in her strength of thought ,</l>
       <l n="77">She fear 'd she prick 'd Leander as she wrought ,</l>
       <l n="78">And oft would shriek so , that her guardian , frighted ,</l>
       <l n="79">Would staring haste , as with some mischief cited :</l>
       <l n="80">They double life that dead things ’ grief sustain ;</l>
       <l n="81">They kill that feel not their friends ’ living pain .</l>
       <l n="82">Sometimes she fear 'd he sought her infamy ;</l>
       <l n="83">And then , as she was working of his eye ,</l>
       <l n="84">She thought to prick it out to quench her ill ;</l>
       <l n="85">But , as she prick 'd , it grew more perfect still :</l>
       <l n="86">Trifling attempts no serious acts advance ;</l>
       <l n="87">The fire of love is blown by dalliance .</l>
       <l n="88">In working his fair neck she did so grace it ,</l>
       <l n="89">She still was working her own arms t ’ embrace it .</l>
       <l n="90">That , and his shoulders , and his hands were seen</l>
       <l n="91">Above the stream ; and with a pure sea-green</l>
       <l n="92">She did so quaintly shadow every limb ,</l>
       <l n="93">All might be seen beneath the waves to swim .</l>
       <l n="94">In this conceited scarf she wrought beside</l>
       <l n="95">A moon in change , and shooting stars did glide</l>
       <l n="96">In number after her with bloody beams ;</l>
       <l n="97">Which figur 'd her affects in their extremes ,</l>
       <l n="98">Pursuing nature in her Cynthian body ,</l>
       <l n="99">And did her thoughts running on change imply ;</l>
       <l n="100">For maids take more delight , when they prepare ,</l>
       <l n="101">And think of wives ’ states , than when wives they are .</l>
       <l n="102">Beneath all these she wrought a fisherman ,</l>
       <l n="103">Drawing his nets from forth the ocean ;</l>
       <l n="104">Who drew so hard , ye might discover well</l>
       <l n="105">The toughen 'd sinews in his neck did swell :</l>
       <l n="106">His inward strains drave out his blood-shot eyes</l>
       <l n="107">And springs of sweat did in his forehead rise ;</l>
       <l n="108">Yet was of naught but of a serpent sped ,</l>
       <l n="109">That in his bosom flew and stung him dead :</l>
       <l n="110">And this by Fate into her mind was sent ,</l>
       <l n="111">Not wrought by mere instinct of her intent .</l>
       <l n="112">At the scarf 's other end her hand did frame ,</l>
       <l n="113">Near the fork 'd point of the divided flame ,</l>
       <l n="114">A country virgin keeping of a vine ,</l>
       <l n="115">Who did of hollow bulrushes combine</l>
       <l n="116">Snares for the stubble-loving grasshopper ,</l>
       <l n="117">And by her lay her scrip that nourish 'd her .</l>
       <l n="118">Within a myrtle shade she sate and sung ;</l>
       <l n="119">And tufts of waving reeds about her sprung</l>
       <l n="120">Where lurk 'd two foxes , that , while she applied</l>
       <l n="121">Her trifling snares , their thieveries did divide ,</l>
       <l n="122">One to the vine , another to her scrip ,</l>
       <l n="123">That she did negligently overslip ;</l>
       <l n="124">By which her fruitful vine and wholesome fare</l>
       <l n="125">She suffer 'd spoil 'd , to make a childish snare .</l>
       <l n="126">These ominous fancies did her soul express ,</l>
       <l n="127">And every finger made a prophetess ,</l>
       <l n="128">To show what death was hid in love 's disguise ,</l>
       <l n="129">And make her judgment conquer Destinies .</l>
       <l n="130">O , what sweet forms fair ladies ’ souls do shroud ,</l>
       <l n="131">Were they made seen and forced through their blood ;</l>
       <l n="132">If through their beauties , like rich work through lawn ,</l>
       <l n="133">They would set forth their minds with virtues drawn ,</l>
       <l n="134">In letting graces from their fingers fly ,</l>
       <l n="135">To still their eyas thoughts with industry :</l>
       <l n="136">That their plied wits in number 'd silks might sing</l>
       <l n="137">Passion 's huge conquest , and their needles leading</l>
       <l n="138">Affection prisoner through their own-built cities ,</l>
       <l n="139">Pinion 'd with stories and Arachnean ditties .</l>
       <l n="140">Proceed we now with Hero 's sacrifice :</l>
       <l n="141">She odours burn 'd , and from their smoke did rise</l>
       <l n="142">Unsavoury fumes , that air with plagues inspir 'd ;</l>
       <l n="143">And then the consecrated sticks she fir 'd ,</l>
       <l n="144">On whose pale frame an angry spirit flew ,</l>
       <l n="145">And beat it down still as it upward grew ;</l>
       <l n="146">The virgin tapers that on th ’ altar stood ,</l>
       <l n="147">When she inflam 'd them , burn 'd as red as blood :</l>
       <l n="148">All sad ostents of that too near success ,</l>
       <l n="149">That made such moving beauties motionless .</l>
       <l n="150">Then Hero wept ; but her affrighted eyes</l>
       <l n="151">She quickly wrested from the sacrifice ,</l>
       <l n="152">Shut them , and inwards for Leander look 'd .</l>
       <l n="153">Search 'd her soft bosom , and from thence she pluck 'd</l>
       <l n="154">His lovely picture : which when she had view 'd ,</l>
       <l n="155">Her beauties were with all love 's joys renew 'd ;</l>
       <l n="156">The odours sweeten 'd , and the fires burn 'd clear ,</l>
       <l n="157">Leander 's form left no ill object there :</l>
       <l n="158">Such was his beauty , that the force of light ,</l>
       <l n="159">Whose knowledge teacheth wonders infinite ,</l>
       <l n="160">The strength of number and proportion ,</l>
       <l n="161">Nature had plac 'd in it to make it known ,</l>
       <l n="162">Art was her daughter , and what human wits</l>
       <l n="163">For study lost , entomb 'd in drossy spirits .</l>
       <l n="164">After this accident , ( which for her glory</l>
       <l n="165">Hero could not but make a history ,)</l>
       <l n="166">Th ’ inhabitants of Sestos and Abydos</l>
       <l n="167">Did every year , with feasts propitious ,</l>
       <l n="168">To fair Leander 's picture sacrifice :</l>
       <l n="169">And they were persons of special price</l>
       <l n="170">That were allow 'd it , as an ornament</l>
       <l n="171">T ’ enrich their houses , for the continent</l>
       <l n="172">Of the strange virtues all approv 'd it held ;</l>
       <l n="173">For even the very look of it repell 'd</l>
       <l n="174">All blastings , witchcrafts , and the strifes of nature</l>
       <l n="175">In those diseases that no herbs could cure :</l>
       <l n="176">The wolfy sting of avarice it would pull ,</l>
       <l n="177">And make the rankest miser bountiful ;</l>
       <l n="178">It kill 'd the fear of thunder and of death ;</l>
       <l n="179">The discords that conceit engendereth</l>
       <l n="180">‘ Twixt man and wife , it for the time would cease ;</l>
       <l n="181">The flames of love it quench 'd , and would increase ;</l>
       <l n="182">Held in a prince 's hand , it would put out</l>
       <l n="183">The dreadful'st comet ; it would ease all doubt</l>
       <l n="184">Of threatened mischiefs ; it would bring asleep</l>
       <l n="185">Such as were mad ; it would enforce to weep</l>
       <l n="186">Most barbarous eyes ; and many more effects</l>
       <l n="187">This picture wrought , and sprung Leandrian sects ;</l>
       <l n="188">Of which was Hero first ; for he whose form ,</l>
       <l n="189">Held in her hand , clear 'd such a fatal storm ,</l>
       <l n="190">From hell she thought his person would defend her ,</l>
       <l n="191">Which night and Hellespont would quickly send her .</l>
       <l n="192">With this confirm 'd , she vow 'd to banish quite</l>
       <l n="193">All thought of any check to her delight ;</l>
       <l n="194">And , in contempt of silly bashfulness ,</l>
       <l n="195">She would the faith of her desires profess ,</l>
       <l n="196">Where her religion should be policy ,</l>
       <l n="197">To follow love with zeal her piety ;</l>
       <l n="198">Her chamber her cathedral-church should be ,</l>
       <l n="199">And her Leander her chief diety ;</l>
       <l n="200">For in her love these did the gods forego ;</l>
       <l n="201">And though her knowledge did not teach her so ,</l>
       <l n="202">Yet did it teach her this , that what her heart</l>
       <l n="203">Did greatest hold in her self-greatest part ,</l>
       <l n="204">That she did make her god ; and ‘ twas less naught</l>
       <l n="205">To leave gods in profession and in thought ,</l>
       <l n="206">Than in her love and life ; for therein lies</l>
       <l n="207">Most of her duties and their dignities ;</l>
       <l n="208">And , rail the brain-bald world at what it will ,</l>
       <l n="209">That 's the grand atheism that reigns in it still .</l>
       <l n="210">Yet singularity she would use no more ,</l>
       <l n="211">For she was singular too much before ;</l>
       <l n="212">But she would please the world with fair pretext ;</l>
       <l n="213">Love would not leave her conscience perplext :</l>
       <l n="214">Great men that will have less do for them , still</l>
       <l n="215">Must bear them out , though th ’ acts be ne'er so ill ;</l>
       <l n="216">Meanness must pander be to Excellence ;</l>
       <l n="217">Pleasure atones Falsehood and Conscience :</l>
       <l n="218">Dissembling was the worst , thought Hero then ,</l>
       <l n="219">And that was best , now she must live with men .</l>
       <l n="220">O virtuous love , that taught her to do best</l>
       <l n="221">When she did worst , and when she thought it least !</l>
       <l n="222">Thus would she still proceed in works divine ,</l>
       <l n="223">And in her sacred state of priesthood shine ,</l>
       <l n="224">Handling the holy rites with hands as bold ,</l>
       <l n="225">As if therein she did Jove 's thunder hold ,</l>
       <l n="226">And need not fear those menaces of error ,</l>
       <l n="227">Which she at others threw with greatest terror .</l>
       <l n="228">O lovely Hero , nothing is thy sin ,</l>
       <l n="229">Weigh 'd with those foul faults other priests are in !</l>
       <l n="230">That having neither faiths , nor works , nor beauties ,</l>
       <l n="231">T ’ engender any ‘ scuse for slubber 'd duties ,</l>
       <l n="232">With as much countenance fill their holy chairs ,</l>
       <l n="233">And sweat denouncements ‘ gainst profane affairs ,</l>
       <l n="234">As if their lives were cut out by their places ,</l>
       <l n="235">And they the only fathers of the graces .</l>
       <l n="236">Now , as with settled mind she did repair</l>
       <l n="237">Her thoughts to sacrifice her ravish 'd hair</l>
       <l n="238">And her torn robe , which on the altar lay ,</l>
       <l n="239">And only for religion 's fire did stay ,</l>
       <l n="240">She heard a thunder by the Cyclops beaten ,</l>
       <l n="241">In such a volley as the world did threaten ,</l>
       <l n="242">Given Venus as she parted th ’ airy sphere ,</l>
       <l n="243">Descending now to chide with Hero here :</l>
       <l n="244">When suddenly the goddess ’ waggoners ,</l>
       <l n="245">The swans and turtles that , in coupled pheres ,</l>
       <l n="246">Through all worlds ’ bosoms draw her influence ,</l>
       <l n="247">Lighted in Hero 's window , and from thence</l>
       <l n="248">To her fair shoulders flew the gentle doves ,—</l>
       <l n="249">Graceful Ædone that sweet pleasure loves ,</l>
       <l n="250">And ruff-foot Chreste with the tufted crown ;</l>
       <l n="251">Both which did kiss her , though their goddess frown .</l>
       <l n="252">The swans did in the solid flood , her glass ,</l>
       <l n="253">Proin their fair plumes ; of which the fairest was</l>
       <l n="254">Jove-lov 'd Leucote , that pure brightness is ;</l>
       <l n="255">The other bounty-loving Dapsilis ,</l>
       <l n="256">All were in heaven , now they with Hero were :</l>
       <l n="257">But Venus ’ looks brought wrath , and urged fear .</l>
       <l n="258">Her robe was scarlet ; black her head 's attire ;</l>
       <l n="259">And through her naked breast shin 'd streams of fire ,</l>
       <l n="260">As when the rarified air is driven</l>
       <l n="261">In flashing streams , and opes the darken 'd heaven .</l>
       <l n="262">In her white hand a wreath of yew she bore ;</l>
       <l n="263">And , breaking th ’ icy wreath sweet Hero wore ,</l>
       <l n="264">She forc 'd about her brows her wreath of yew ,</l>
       <l n="265">And said , “ Now , minion , to thy fate be true ,</l>
       <l n="266">Though not to me ; endure what this portends :</l>
       <l n="267">Begin where lightness will , in shame it ends .</l>
       <l n="268">Love makes thee cunning ; thou art current now ,</l>
       <l n="269">By being counterfeit : thy broken vow</l>
       <l n="270">Deceit with her pied garters must rejoin ,</l>
       <l n="271">And with her stamp thou countenances must coin ;</l>
       <l n="272">Coyness , and pure deceits , for purities ,</l>
       <l n="273">And still a maid wilt seem in cozen 'd eyes ,</l>
       <l n="274">And have an antic face to laugh within ,</l>
       <l n="275">While thy smooth looks make men digest thy sin ,</l>
       <l n="276">But since thy lips ( least thought forsworn ) forswore ,</l>
       <l n="277">Be never virgin 's vow worth trusting more ! ”</l>
       <l n="278">When Beauty 's dearest did her goddess hear</l>
       <l n="279">Breathe such rebukes ‘ gainst that she could not clear ,</l>
       <l n="280">Dumb sorrow spake aloud in tears and blood ,</l>
       <l n="281">That from her grief-burst veins , in piteous flood ,</l>
       <l n="282">From the sweet conduits of her favour fell .</l>
       <l n="283">The gentle turtles did with moans make swell</l>
       <l n="284">Their shining gorges ; the white black-ey 'd swans</l>
       <l n="285">Did sing as woful epicedians .</l>
       <l n="286">As they would straightways die : when Pity 's queen ,</l>
       <l n="287">The goddess Ecte , that had ever been</l>
       <l n="288">Hid in a watery cloud near Hero 's cries ,</l>
       <l n="289">Since the first instant of her broken eyes ,</l>
       <l n="290">Gave bright Leucote voice , and made her speak ,</l>
       <l n="291">To ease her anguish , whose swoln breast did break</l>
       <l n="292">With anger at her goddess , that did touch</l>
       <l n="293">Hero so near for that she us 'd so much ;</l>
       <l n="294">And , thrusting her white neck at Venus , said :</l>
       <l n="295">“ Why may not amorous Hero seem a maid ,</l>
       <l n="296">Though she be none , as well as you suppress</l>
       <l n="297">In modest cheeks your inward wantonness ?</l>
       <l n="298">How often have we drawn you from above ,</l>
       <l n="299">T ’ exchange with mortals rites for rites in love !</l>
       <l n="300">Why in your priest , then , call you that offence ,</l>
       <l n="301">That shines in you , and is your influence ? ”</l>
       <l n="302">With this , the Furies stopp 'd Leucote 's lips ,</l>
       <l n="303">Enjoin 'd by Venus ; who with rosy whips</l>
       <l n="304">Beat the kind bird . Fierce lightning from her eyes</l>
       <l n="305">Did set on fire fair Hero 's sacrifice ,</l>
       <l n="306">Which was her torn robe and enforced hair ;</l>
       <l n="307">And the bright flame became a maid most fair</l>
       <l n="308">For her aspect : her tresses were of wire ,</l>
       <l n="309">Knit like a net , where hearts , set all on fire ,</l>
       <l n="310">Struggled in pants , and could not get releast ;</l>
       <l n="311">Her arms were all with golden pincers drest ,</l>
       <l n="312">And twenty-fashion 'd knots , pulleys , and brakes ,</l>
       <l n="313">And all her body girt with painted snakes ;</l>
       <l n="314">Her down-parts in a scorpion 's tail combin 'd ,</l>
       <l n="315">Freckled with twenty colours ; pied wings shin 'd</l>
       <l n="316">Out of her shoulders ; cloth had never dye ,</l>
       <l n="317">Nor sweeter colours never viewed eye ,</l>
       <l n="318">In scorching Turkey , Cares , Tartary ,</l>
       <l n="319">Than shin 'd about this spirit notorious ;</l>
       <l n="320">Nor was Arachne 's web so glorious .</l>
       <l n="321">Of lightning , and of shreds she was begot ;</l>
       <l n="322">More hold in base dissemblers is there not .</l>
       <l n="323">Her name was Eronusis . Venus flew</l>
       <l n="324">From Hero 's sight , and at her chariot drew</l>
       <l n="325">This wondrous creature to so steep a height ,</l>
       <l n="326">That all the world she might command with sleight</l>
       <l n="327">Of her gay wings ; and then she bade her haste ,—</l>
       <l n="328">Since Hero had dissembled , and disgrac 'd</l>
       <l n="329">Her rites so much ,— and every breast infect</l>
       <l n="330">With her deceits : she made her architect</l>
       <l n="331">Of all dissimulation ; and since then</l>
       <l n="332">Never was any trust in maids or men .</l>
       <l n="333">O , it spited</l>
       <l n="334">Fair Venus ’ heart to see her most delighted ,</l>
       <l n="335">And one she choos 'd , for temper of her mind ,</l>
       <l n="336">To be the only ruler of her kind ,</l>
       <l n="337">So soon to let her virgin race be ended !</l>
       <l n="338">Not simply for the fault a whit offended ,</l>
       <l n="339">But that in strife for chasteness with the Moon ,</l>
       <l n="340">Spiteful Diana bade her show but one</l>
       <l n="341">That was her servant vow 'd , and liv 'd a maid ;</l>
       <l n="342">And , now she thought to answer that upbraid ,</l>
       <l n="343">Hero had lost her answer : who knows not</l>
       <l n="344">Venus would seem as far from any spot</l>
       <l n="345">Of light demeanour , as the very skin</l>
       <l n="346">‘ Twixt Cynthia 's brows ? sin is asham 'd of sin .</l>
       <l n="347">Up Venus flew , and scarce durst up for fear</l>
       <l n="348">Of Ph  be 's laughter , when she pass 'd her sphere :</l>
       <l n="349">And so most ugly-clouded was the light ,</l>
       <l n="350">That day was hid in day ; night came ere night ;</l>
       <l n="351">And Venus could not through the thick air pierce ,</l>
       <l n="352">Till the day 's king , god of undaunted verse ,</l>
       <l n="353">Because she was so plentiful a theme</l>
       <l n="354">To such as wore his laurel anademe ,</l>
       <l n="355">Like to a fiery bullet made descent ,</l>
       <l n="356">And from her passage those fat vapours rent ,</l>
       <l n="357">That , being not thoroughly rarified to rain ,</l>
       <l n="358">Melted like pitch , as blue as any vein ;</l>
       <l n="359">And scalding tempests made the earth to shrink</l>
       <l n="360">Under their fervour , and the world did think</l>
       <l n="361">In every drop a torturing spirit flew ,</l>
       <l n="362">It pierc 'd so deeply , and it burn 'd so blue .</l>
       <l n="363">Betwixt all this and Hero , Hero held</l>
       <l n="364">Leander 's picture , as a Persian shield ;</l>
       <l n="365">And she was free from fear of worst success :</l>
       <l n="366">The more ill threats us , we suspect the less :</l>
       <l n="367">As we grow hapless , violence subtle grows ,</l>
       <l n="368">Dumb , deaf , and blind , and comes when no man knows .</l>

       <l n="1">Day doubles her accustomed date ,</l>
       <l n="2">As loath the Night , incens 'd by Fate ,</l>
       <l n="3">Should wreck our lovers . Hero 's plight ;</l>
       <l n="4">Longs for Leander and the night :</l>
       <l n="5">Which ere her thirsty wish recovers ,</l>
       <l n="6">She sends for two betrothed lovers ,</l>
       <l n="7">And marries tham , that , with their crew ,</l>
       <l n="8">Their sports , and ceremonies due ,</l>
       <l n="9">She covertly might celebrate ,</l>
       <l n="10">With secret joy , her own estate .</l>
       <l n="11">She makes a feast , at which appears</l>
       <l n="12">The wild nymph Teras , that still bears</l>
       <l n="13">An ivory lute , tells ominous tales ,</l>
       <l n="14">And sings at solemn festivals .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="15">Now was bright Hero weary of the day ,</l>
       <l n="16">Thought an Olympiad in Leander 's stay .</l>
       <l n="17">Sol and the soft-foot Hours hung on his arms ,</l>
       <l n="18">And would not let him swim , forseeing his harms :</l>
       <l n="19">That day Aurora double grace obtain 'd ,</l>
       <l n="20">Of her love Ph  bus ; she his horses reign 'd ,</l>
       <l n="21">Set on his golden knee , and , as she list ,</l>
       <l n="22">She pull 'd him back ; and , as she pull 'd , she kiss 'd ,</l>
       <l n="23">To have him turn to bed : he lov 'd her more ,</l>
       <l n="24">To see the love Leander Hero bore :</l>
       <l n="25">Examples profit much ; ten times in one ,</l>
       <l n="26">In persons full of note , good deeds are done .</l>
       <l n="27">Day was so long , men walking fell asleep ;</l>
       <l n="28">The heavy humours that their eyes did steep</l>
       <l n="29">Made them fear mischiefs . The hard streets were beds</l>
       <l n="30">For covetous churls and for ambitious heads ,</l>
       <l n="31">That , spite of Nature , would their business ply :</l>
       <l n="32">All thought they had the falling epilepsy ,</l>
       <l n="33">Men grovell 'd so upon the smother 'd ground ;</l>
       <l n="34">And pity did the heart of Heaven confound .</l>
       <l n="35">The Gods , the Graces , and the Muses came</l>
       <l n="36">Down to the Destinies , to stay the frame</l>
       <l n="37">Of the true lovers ’ deaths , and all world 's tears :</l>
       <l n="38">But Death before had stopp 'd their cruel ears .</l>
       <l n="39">All the celestials parted mourning then ,</l>
       <l n="40">Pierc 'd with our human miseries more than men :</l>
       <l n="41">Ah , nothing doth the world with mischief fill ,</l>
       <l n="42">But want of feeling one another 's ill !</l>
       <l n="43">With their descent the day grew something fair ,</l>
       <l n="44">And cast a brighter robe upon the air .</l>
       <l n="45">Hero , to shorten time with merriment ,</l>
       <l n="46">For young Alcmane and bright Mya sent ,</l>
       <l n="47">Two lovers that had long crav 'd marriage-dues</l>
       <l n="48">At Hero 's hands : but she did still refuse ;</l>
       <l n="49">For lovely Mya was her consort vow 'd</l>
       <l n="50">In her maid state , and therefore not allow 'd</l>
       <l n="51">To amorous nuptials : yet fair Hero now</l>
       <l n="52">Intended to dispense with her cold vow ,</l>
       <l n="53">Since hers was broken , and to marry her :</l>
       <l n="54">The rites would pleasing matter minister</l>
       <l n="55">To her conceits , and shorten tedious day .</l>
       <l n="56">They came ; sweet Music usher 'd th ’ odorous way ,</l>
       <l n="57">And wanton Air in twenty sweet forms danc 'd</l>
       <l n="58">After her fingers ; Beauty and Love advanc 'd</l>
       <l n="59">Their ensigns in the downless rosy faces</l>
       <l n="60">Of youths and maids , led after by the Graces .</l>
       <l n="61">For all these Hero made a friendly feast ,</l>
       <l n="62">Welcom 'd them kindly , did much love protest ,</l>
       <l n="63">Winning their hearts with all the means she might ,</l>
       <l n="64">That , when her fault should chance t ’ abide the light ,</l>
       <l n="65">Their loves might cover or extenuate it ,</l>
       <l n="66">And high in her worst fate make pity sit .</l>
       <l n="67">She married them ; and in the banquet came ,</l>
       <l n="68">Borne by the virgins . Hero striv 'd to frame</l>
       <l n="69">Her thoughts to mirth : ay me ! but hard it is</l>
       <l n="70">To imitate a false and forced bliss ;</l>
       <l n="71">Ill may a sad mind forge a merry face ,</l>
       <l n="72">Nor hath constrained laughter any grace .</l>
       <l n="73">Then laid she wines on cares to make them sink :</l>
       <l n="74">Who fears the threats of Fortune , let him drink .</l>
       <l n="75">To these quick nuptials enter 'd suddenly</l>
       <l n="76">Admired Teras with the ebon thigh ;</l>
       <l n="77">A nymph that haunted the green Sestian groves ,</l>
       <l n="78">And would consort soft virgins in their loves ,</l>
       <l n="79">At gaysome triumphs and on solemn days ,</l>
       <l n="80">Singing prophetic elegies and lays ,</l>
       <l n="81">And fingering of a silver lute she tied</l>
       <l n="82">With black and purple scarfs by her left side .</l>
       <l n="83">Apollo gave it , and her skill withal ,</l>
       <l n="84">And she was term 'd his dwarf , she was so small :</l>
       <l n="85">Yet great in virtue , for his beams enclos 'd</l>
       <l n="86">His virtues in her ; never was propos 'd</l>
       <l n="87">Riddle to her , or augury , strange or new ,</l>
       <l n="88">But she resolv 'd it ; never slight tale flew</l>
       <l n="89">From her charm 'd lips without important sense ,</l>
       <l n="90">Shown in some grave succeeding consequence .</l>
       <l n="91">This little sylvan , with her songs and tales ,</l>
       <l n="92">Gave such estate to feasts and nuptials ,</l>
       <l n="93">That though ofttimes she forewent tragedies ,</l>
       <l n="94">Yet for her strangeness still she pleas 'd their eyes ;</l>
       <l n="95">And for her smallness they admir 'd her so ,</l>
       <l n="96">They thought her perfect born , and could not grow .</l>
       <l n="97">All eyes were on her . Hero did command</l>
       <l n="98">An altar deck 'd with sacred state should stand</l>
       <l n="99">At the feast 's upper end , close by the bride ,</l>
       <l n="100">On which the pretty nymph might sit espied .</l>
       <l n="101">Then all were silent ; every one so hears ,</l>
       <l n="102">As all their senses climb 'd into their ears :</l>
       <l n="103">And first this amorous tale , that fitted well</l>
       <l n="104">Fair Hero and the nuptials , she did tell .</l>

       <l n="106">Hymen , that now is god of nuptial rites ,</l>
       <l n="107">And crowns with honour Love and his delights ,</l>
       <l n="108">Of Athens was a youth , so sweet a face ,</l>
       <l n="109">That many thought him of the female race ;</l>
       <l n="110">Such quickening brightness did his clear eyes dart ,</l>
       <l n="111">Warm went their beams to his beholder 's heart ,</l>
       <l n="112">In such pure leagues his beauties were combin 'd ,</l>
       <l n="113">That there your nuptial contracts first were sign 'd ;</l>
       <l n="114">For as proportion , white and crimson , meet</l>
       <l n="115">In beauty 's mixture , all right clear and sweet ,</l>
       <l n="116">The eye responsible , the golden hair ,</l>
       <l n="117">And none is held , without the other , fair ;</l>
       <l n="118">All spring together , all together fade ;</l>
       <l n="119">Such intermix 'd affections should invade</l>
       <l n="120">Two perfect lovers ; which being yet unseen ,</l>
       <l n="121">Their virtues and their comforts copied been</l>
       <l n="122">In beauty 's concord , subject to the eye ;</l>
       <l n="123">And that , in Hymen , pleas 'd so matchlessly ,</l>
       <l n="124">That lovers were esteem 'd in their full grace ,</l>
       <l n="125">Like form and colour mix 'd in Hymen 's face ;</l>
       <l n="126">And such sweet concord was thought worthy then</l>
       <l n="127">Of torches , music , feasts , and greatest men :</l>
       <l n="128">So Hymen look 'd , that even the chastest mind</l>
       <l n="129">He mov 'd to join in joys of sacred kind ;</l>
       <l n="130">For only now his chin 's first down consorted</l>
       <l n="131">His head 's rich fleece , in golden curls contorted ;</l>
       <l n="132">And as he was so lov 'd , he lov 'd so too :</l>
       <l n="133">So should best beauties , bound by nuptials , do .</l>
       <l n="134">Bright Eucharis , who was by all men said</l>
       <l n="135">The noblest , fairest , and the richest maid</l>
       <l n="136">Of all th ’ Athenian damsels , Hymen lov 'd</l>
       <l n="137">With such transmission , that his heart remov 'd</l>
       <l n="138">From his white breast to hers : but her estate ,</l>
       <l n="139">In passing his , was so interminate</l>
       <l n="140">For wealth and honour , that his love durst feed</l>
       <l n="141">On naught but sight and hearing , nor could breed</l>
       <l n="142">Hope of requital , the grand prize of love ;</l>
       <l n="143">Nor could he hear or see , but he must prove</l>
       <l n="144">How his rare beauty 's music would agree</l>
       <l n="145">With maids in consort ; therefore robbed he</l>
       <l n="146">His chin of those same few first fruits it bore ,</l>
       <l n="147">And , clad in such attire as virgins wore ,</l>
       <l n="148">He kept them company ; and might right well ,</l>
       <l n="149">For he did all but Eucharis excel</l>
       <l n="150">In all the fair of beauty : yet he wanted</l>
       <l n="151">Virtue to make his own desires implanted</l>
       <l n="152">In his dear Eucharis ; for women never</l>
       <l n="153">Love beauty in their sex , but envy ever .</l>
       <l n="154">His judgment yet , that durst not suit address ,</l>
       <l n="155">Nor , past due means , presume of due success ,</l>
       <l n="156">Reason gat Fortune in the end to speed</l>
       <l n="157">To his best prayers : but strange it seem 'd , indeed ,</l>
       <l n="158">That Fortune should a chaste affection bless :</l>
       <l n="159">Preferment seldom graceth bashfulness .</l>
       <l n="160">Nor grac 'd it Hymen yet ; but many a dart ,</l>
       <l n="161">And many an amorous thought , enthrill 'd his heart ,</l>
       <l n="162">Ere he obtain 'd her ; and he sick became ,</l>
       <l n="163">Forc 'd to abstain her sight ; and then the flame</l>
       <l n="164">Rag 'd in his bosom . O , what grief did fill him !</l>
       <l n="165">Sight made him sick , and want of sight did kill him .</l>
       <l n="166">The virgins wonder 'd where Diætia stay 'd ,</l>
       <l n="167">For so did Hymen term himself , a maid .</l>
       <l n="168">At length with sickly looks he greeted them :</l>
       <l n="169">‘ Tis strange to see ‘ gainst what an extreme stream</l>
       <l n="170">A lover strives ; poor Hymen look 'd so ill ,</l>
       <l n="171">That as in merit he increased still</l>
       <l n="172">By suffering much , so he in grace decreas 'd :</l>
       <l n="173">Women are most won , when men merit least :</l>
       <l n="174">If Merit look not well , Love bids stand by ;</l>
       <l n="175">Love 's special lesson is to please the eye .</l>
       <l n="176">And Hymen soon recovering all he lost ,</l>
       <l n="177">Deceiving still these maids , but himself most ,</l>
       <l n="178">His love and he with many virgin dames ,</l>
       <l n="179">Noble by birth , noble by beauty 's flames ,</l>
       <l n="180">Leaving the town with songs and hallow 'd lights ,</l>
       <l n="181">To do great Ceres Eleusina rites</l>
       <l n="182">Of zealous sacrifice , were made a prey</l>
       <l n="183">To barbarous rovers , that in ambush lay ,</l>
       <l n="184">And with rude hands enforc 'd their shining spoil ,</l>
       <l n="185">Far from the darken 'd city , tir 'd with toil :</l>
       <l n="186">And when the yellow issue of the sky</l>
       <l n="187">Came trooping forth , jealous of cruelty</l>
       <l n="188">To their bright fellows of this under-heaven ,</l>
       <l n="189">Into a double night they saw them driven ,—</l>
       <l n="190">A horrid cave , the thieves ’ black mansion ;</l>
       <l n="191">Where , weary of the journey they had gone ,</l>
       <l n="192">Their last night 's watch , and drunk with their sweet gains ,</l>
       <l n="193">Dull Morpheus enter 'd , laden with silken chains ,</l>
       <l n="194">Stronger than iron , and bound the swelling veins</l>
       <l n="195">And tired senses of these lawless swains .</l>
       <l n="196">But when the virgin lights thus dimly burn 'd ,</l>
       <l n="197">O , what a hell was heaven in ! how they mourn 'd ,</l>
       <l n="198">And wrung their hands , and wound their gentle forms</l>
       <l n="199">Into the shapes of sorrow ! golden storms</l>
       <l n="200">Fell from their eyes ; as when the sun appears ,</l>
       <l n="201">And yet it rains , so show 'd their eyes their tears :</l>
       <l n="202">And , as when funeral dames watch a dead corse ,</l>
       <l n="203">Weeping about it , telling with remorse</l>
       <l n="204">What pains he felt , how long in pain he lay ,</l>
       <l n="205">How little food he eat , what he would say ,</l>
       <l n="206">And then mix mournful tales of others ’ deaths ,</l>
       <l n="207">Smothering themselves in clouds of their own breaths ;</l>
       <l n="208">At length , one cheering other , call for wine ;</l>
       <l n="209">The golden bowl drinks tears out of their eyne ,</l>
       <l n="210">As they drink wine from it ; and round it goes ,</l>
       <l n="211">Each helping other to relieve their woes ;</l>
       <l n="212">So cast these virgins ’ beauties mutual rays ,</l>
       <l n="213">One lights another , face the face displays ;</l>
       <l n="214">Lips by reflection kiss 'd , and hands hands shook ,</l>
       <l n="215">Even by the whiteness each of other took .</l>
       <l n="216">But Hymen now us 'd friendly Morpheus ’ aid ,</l>
       <l n="217">Slew every thief , and rescu 'd every maid :</l>
       <l n="218">And now did his enamour 'd passion take</l>
       <l n="219">Heart from his hearty deed , whose worth did make</l>
       <l n="220">His hope of bounteous Eucharis more strong ;</l>
       <l n="221">And now came Love with Proteus , who had long</l>
       <l n="222">Juggled the little god with prayers and gifts ,</l>
       <l n="223">Ran through all shapes , and varied all his shifts ,</l>
       <l n="224">To win Love 's stay with him , and make him love him ;</l>
       <l n="225">And when he saw no strength of sleight could move him</l>
       <l n="226">To make him love or stay , he nimbly turn 'd</l>
       <l n="227">Into Love 's self , he so extremely burn 'd .</l>
       <l n="228">And thus came Love , with Proteus and his power ,</l>
       <l n="229">T ’ encounter Eucharis : first , like the flower</l>
       <l n="230">That Juno 's milk did spring , the silver lily ,</l>
       <l n="231">He fell on Hymen 's hand , who straight did spy</l>
       <l n="232">The bounteous godhead , and with wondrous joy</l>
       <l n="233">Offer 'd it Eucharis . She , wondrous coy ,</l>
       <l n="234">Drew back her hand : the subtle flower did woo it ,</l>
       <l n="235">And , drawing it near , mix 'd so you could not know it :</l>
       <l n="236">As two clear tapers mix in one their light ,</l>
       <l n="237">So did the lily and the hand their white .</l>
       <l n="238">She view 'd it ; and her view the form bestows</l>
       <l n="239">Amongst her spirits : for , as colour flows</l>
       <l n="240">From superficies of each thing we see ,</l>
       <l n="241">Even so with colours forms emitted be ;</l>
       <l n="242">And where Love 's form is , Love is ; Love is form :</l>
       <l n="243">He enter 'd at the eye ; his sacred storm</l>
       <l n="244">Rose from the hand , Love 's sweetest instrument :</l>
       <l n="245">It stirr 'd her blood 's sea so , that high it went ,</l>
       <l n="246">And beat in bashful waves ‘ gainst the white shore</l>
       <l n="247">Of her divided cheeks ; it rag 'd the more ,</l>
       <l n="248">Because the tide went ‘ gainst the haughty wind</l>
       <l n="249">Of her estate and birth : and , as we find ,</l>
       <l n="250">In fainting ebbs , the flowery Zephyr hurls</l>
       <l n="251">The green-hair 'd Hellespont , broke in silver curls ,</l>
       <l n="252">‘ Gainst Hero 's tower ; but in his blast 's retreat ,</l>
       <l n="253">The waves obeying him , they after beat ,</l>
       <l n="254">Leaving the chalky shore a great way pale ,</l>
       <l n="255">Then moist it freshly with another gale ;</l>
       <l n="256">So ebb 'd and flow 'd in Eucharis 's face ,</l>
       <l n="257">Coyness and Love striv 'd which had greatest grace ;</l>
       <l n="258">Virginity did fight on Coyness ’ side ,</l>
       <l n="259">Fear of her parents ’ frowns , and female pride</l>
       <l n="260">Loathing the lower place , more than it loves</l>
       <l n="261">The high contents desert and virtue moves .</l>
       <l n="262">With Love fought Hymen 's beauty and his valure ,</l>
       <l n="263">Which scarce could so much favour yet allure</l>
       <l n="264">To come to strike , but fameless idle stood :</l>
       <l n="265">Action is fiery valour 's sovereign good .</l>
       <l n="266">But Love , once enter 'd , wish 'd no greater aid</l>
       <l n="267">Than he could find within ; thought thought betray 'd ;</l>
       <l n="268">The brib 'd , but incorrupted , garrison</l>
       <l n="269">Sung “ Io Hymen ” ; there those songs begun ,</l>
       <l n="270">And Love was grown so rich with such a gain ,</l>
       <l n="271">And wanton with the ease of his free reign ,</l>
       <l n="272">That he would turn into her roughest frowns</l>
       <l n="273">To turn them out ; and thus he Hymen crowns</l>
       <l n="274">King of his thoughts , man 's greatest empery :</l>
       <l n="275">This was his first brave step to deity .</l>
       <l n="276">Home to the mourning city they repair ,</l>
       <l n="277">With news as wholesome as the morning air ,</l>
       <l n="278">To the sad parents of each saved maid :</l>
       <l n="279">But Hymen and his Eucharis had laid</l>
       <l n="280">This plat , to make the flame of their delight</l>
       <l n="281">Round as the moon at full , and full as bright .</l>
       <l n="282">Because the parents of chaste Eucharis</l>
       <l n="283">Exceeding Hymen 's so , might cross their bliss ;</l>
       <l n="284">And as the world rewards deserts , that law</l>
       <l n="285">Cannot assist with force ; so when they saw</l>
       <l n="286">Their daughter safe , take vantage of their own ,</l>
       <l n="287">Praise Hymen 's valour much , nothing bestown ;</l>
       <l n="288">Hymen must leave the virgins in a grove</l>
       <l n="289">Far off from Athens , and go first to prove ,</l>
       <l n="290">If to restore them all with fame and life ,</l>
       <l n="291">He should enjoy his dearest as his wife .</l>
       <l n="292">This told to all the maids , the most agree :</l>
       <l n="293">The riper sort , knowing what ‘ tis to be</l>
       <l n="294">The first month of a news so far deriv 'd ,</l>
       <l n="295">And that to hear and bear news brave folks liv 'd ,</l>
       <l n="296">As being a carriage special hard to bear</l>
       <l n="297">Occurrents , these occurrents being so dear ,</l>
       <l n="298">They did with grace protest , they were content</l>
       <l n="299">T ’ accost their friends with all their compliment ,</l>
       <l n="300">For Hymen 's good ; but to incur their harm ,</l>
       <l n="301">There he must pardon them . This wit went warm</l>
       <l n="302">To Adolesche 's brain , a nymph born high ,</l>
       <l n="303">Made all of voice and fire , that upwards fly :</l>
       <l n="304">Her heart and all her forces ’ nether train</l>
       <l n="305">Climb 'd to her tongue , and thither fell her brain ,</l>
       <l n="306">Since it could go no higher ; and it must go ;</l>
       <l n="307">All power she had , even her tongue , did so :</l>
       <l n="308">In spirit and quickness she much joy did take ,</l>
       <l n="309">And lov 'd her tongue , only for quickness ’ sake ;</l>
       <l n="310">And she would haste and tell . The rest all stay :</l>
       <l n="311">Hymen goes one , the nymph another way ;</l>
       <l n="312">And what became of her I 'll tell at last :</l>
       <l n="313">Yet take her visage now ;— moist-lipp 'd , long-fac 'd ,</l>
       <l n="314">Thin like an iron wedge , so sharp and tart ,</l>
       <l n="315">As ‘ twere of purpose made to cleave Love 's heart :</l>
       <l n="316">Well were this lovely beauty rid of her .</l>
       <l n="317">And Hymen did at Athens now prefer</l>
       <l n="318">His welcome suit , which he with joy aspir 'd :</l>
       <l n="319">A hundred princely youths with him retir 'd</l>
       <l n="320">To fetch the nymphs ; chariots and music went</l>
       <l n="321">And home they came : heaven with applauses rent .</l>
       <l n="322">The nuptials straight proceed , whiles all the town ,</l>
       <l n="323">Fresh in their joys , might do them most renown .</l>
       <l n="324">First , gold-lock 'd Hymen did to church repair ,</l>
       <l n="325">Like a quick offering burn 'd in flames of hair ;</l>
       <l n="326">And after , with a virgin firmament</l>
       <l n="327">The godhead-proving bride attended went</l>
       <l n="328">Before them all : she look 'd in her command ,</l>
       <l n="329">As if form-giving Cypria 's silver hand</l>
       <l n="330">Gripp 'd all their beauties , and crushed out one flame ;</l>
       <l n="331">She blush 'd to see how beauty overcame</l>
       <l n="332">The thoughts of all men . Next , before her went</l>
       <l n="333">Five lovely children , deck 'd with ornament</l>
       <l n="334">Of her sweet colours , bearing torches by ;</l>
       <l n="335">For light was held a happy augury</l>
       <l n="336">Of generation , whose efficient right</l>
       <l n="337">Is nothing else but to produce to light .</l>
       <l n="338">The odd disparent number they did choose ,</l>
       <l n="339">To show the union married loves should use ,</l>
       <l n="340">Since in two equal parts it will not sever ,</l>
       <l n="341">But the midst holds one to rejoin it ever ,</l>
       <l n="342">As common to both parts : men therefore deem</l>
       <l n="343">That equal number gods do not esteem ,</l>
       <l n="344">Being authors of sweet peace and unity ,</l>
       <l n="345">But pleasing to th ’ infernal empery ,</l>
       <l n="346">Under whose ensigns Wars and Discords fight ,</l>
       <l n="347">Since an even number you may disunite</l>
       <l n="348">In two parts equal , naught in middle left</l>
       <l n="349">To reunite each part from other reft ;</l>
       <l n="350">And five they hold in most especial prize ,</l>
       <l n="351">Since ‘ tis the first odd number that doth rise</l>
       <l n="352">From the two foremost numbers ’ unity ,</l>
       <l n="353">That odd and even are ; which are two and three ;</l>
       <l n="354">For one no number is ; but thence doth flow</l>
       <l n="355">The powerful race of number . Next , did go</l>
       <l n="356">A noble matron , that did spinning bear</l>
       <l n="357">A huswife 's rock and spindle , and did wear</l>
       <l n="358">A wether 's skin , with all the snowy fleece ,</l>
       <l n="359">To intimate that even the daintiest piece</l>
       <l n="360">And noblest-born dame should industrious be :</l>
       <l n="361">That which does good disgraceth no degree .</l>
       <l n="362">And now to Juno 's temple they are come ,</l>
       <l n="363">Where her grave priest stood in the marriage-room :</l>
       <l n="364">On his right arm did hang a scarlet veil ,</l>
       <l n="365">And from his shoulders to the ground did trail ,</l>
       <l n="366">On either side , ribands of white and blue :</l>
       <l n="367">With the red veil he hid the bashful hue</l>
       <l n="368">Of the chaste bride , to show the modest shame ,</l>
       <l n="369">In coupling with a man , should grace a dame .</l>
       <l n="370">Then took he the disparent silks , and tied</l>
       <l n="371">The lovers by the waists , and side by side ,</l>
       <l n="372">In token that hereafter they must bind</l>
       <l n="373">In one self-sacred knot each other 's mind .</l>
       <l n="374">Before them on an altar he presented</l>
       <l n="375">Both fire and water , which was first invented ,</l>
       <l n="376">Since to ingenerate every human creature</l>
       <l n="377">And every other birth produc 'd by Nature ,</l>
       <l n="378">Moisture and heat must mix ; so man and wife</l>
       <l n="379">For human race must join in nuptial life .</l>
       <l n="380">Then one of Juno 's birds , the painted jay ,</l>
       <l n="381">He sacrific 'd , and took the gall away ;</l>
       <l n="382">All which he did behind the altar throw ,</l>
       <l n="383">In sign no bitterness of hate should grow ,</l>
       <l n="384">‘ Twixt married loves , nor any least disdain .</l>
       <l n="385">Nothing they spake , for ‘ twas esteem 'd too plain</l>
       <l n="386">For the most silken mildness of a maid ,</l>
       <l n="387">To let a public audience hear it said ,</l>
       <l n="388">She boldly took the man ; and so respected</l>
       <l n="389">Was bashfulness in Athens , it erected</l>
       <l n="390">To chaste Agneia , which is Shamefacedness ,</l>
       <l n="391">A sacred temple , holding her a goddess .</l>
       <l n="392">And now to feasts , masks , and triumphant shows ,</l>
       <l n="393">The shining troops return 'd , even till earth-throes</l>
       <l n="394">Brought forth with joy the thickest part of night ,</l>
       <l n="395">When the sweet nuptial song , that us 'd to cite</l>
       <l n="396">All to their rest , was by Phemonöe sung ,</l>
       <l n="397">First Delphian prophetess , whose graces sprung</l>
       <l n="398">Out of the Muses ’ well : she sung before</l>
       <l n="399">The bride into her chamber ; at which door</l>
       <l n="400">A matron and a torch-bearer did stand :</l>
       <l n="401">A painted box of confits in her hand</l>
       <l n="402">The matron held , and so did other some</l>
       <l n="403">That compass 'd round the honour 'd nuptial room .</l>
       <l n="404">The custom was that every maid did wear ,</l>
       <l n="405">During her maidenhead , a silken sphere</l>
       <l n="406">About her waist , above her inmost weed ,</l>
       <l n="407">Knit with Minerva 's knot , and that was freed</l>
       <l n="408">By the fair bridegroom on the marriage-night ,</l>
       <l n="409">With many ceremonies of delight :</l>
       <l n="410">And yet eternis 'd Hymen 's tender bride ,</l>
       <l n="411">To suffer it dissolv 'd so , sweetly cried .</l>
       <l n="412">The maids that heard , so lov 'd and did adore her ,</l>
       <l n="413">They wish 'd with all their hearts to suffer for her .</l>
       <l n="414">So had the matrons , that with confits stood</l>
       <l n="415">About the chamber , such affectionate blood ,</l>
       <l n="416">And so true feeling of her harmless pains ,</l>
       <l n="417">That every one a shower of confits rains ;</l>
       <l n="418">For which the bride-youths scrambling on the ground ,</l>
       <l n="419">In noise of that sweet hail her cries were drown 'd .</l>
       <l n="420">And thus blest Hymen joy 'd his gracious bride ,</l>
       <l n="421">And for his joy was after deified .</l>
       <l n="422">The saffron mirror by which Ph  bus ’ love ,</l>
       <l n="423">Green Tellus , decks her , now he held above</l>
       <l n="424">The cloudy mountains : and the noble maid ,</l>
       <l n="425">Sharp-visag 'd Adolesche , that was stray 'd</l>
       <l n="426">Out of her way , in hasting with her news ,</l>
       <l n="427">Not till this hour th ’ Athenian turrets views ;</l>
       <l n="428">And now brought home by guides , she heard by all ,</l>
       <l n="429">That her long kept occurrents would be stale ,</l>
       <l n="430">And how fair Hymen 's honours did excel</l>
       <l n="431">For those rare news which she came short to tell .</l>
       <l n="432">To hear her dear tongue robb 'd of such a joy ,</l>
       <l n="433">Made the well-spoken nymph take such a toy ,</l>
       <l n="434">That down she sunk : when lightning from above</l>
       <l n="435">Shrunk her lean body , and , for mere free love ,</l>
       <l n="436">Turn 'd her into the pied-plum 'd Psittacus ,</l>

       <l n="1">Leucote flies to all the Winds ,</l>
       <l n="2">And from the Fates their outrage blinds ,</l>

       <l n="4">Leander , with Love 's complete fleet</l>
       <l n="5">Mann 'd in himself , puts forth to seas ;</l>

       <l n="7">With Até , stirs the winds to war</l>
       <l n="8">Upon the Hellespont : their jar</l>
       <l n="9">Drowns poor Leander . Hero 's eyes ,</l>
       <l n="10">Wet witnesses of his surprise ,</l>
       <l n="11">Her torch blown out , grief casts her down</l>
       <l n="12">Upon her love , and both doth drown :</l>
       <l n="13">In whose just ruth the god of seas</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="15">No longer could the Day nor Destinies</l>
       <l n="16">Delay the Night , who now did frowning rise</l>
       <l n="17">Into her throne ; and at her humorous breasts</l>
       <l n="18">Visions and Dreams lay sucking : all men 's rests</l>
       <l n="19">Fell like the mists of death upon their eyes ,</l>
       <l n="20">Day 's too-long darts so kill 'd their faculties .</l>
       <l n="21">The Winds yet , like the flowers , to cease began ;</l>
       <l n="22">For bright Leucote , Venus ’ whitest swan ,</l>
       <l n="23">That held sweet Hero dear , spread her fair wings ,</l>
       <l n="24">Like to a field of snow , and message brings</l>
       <l n="25">From Venus to the Fates , t'entreat them lay</l>
       <l n="26">Their charge upon the Winds their rage to stay ,</l>
       <l n="27">That the stern battle of the seas might cease ,</l>
       <l n="28">And guard Leander to his love in peace .</l>
       <l n="29">The Fates consent ;— ay me , dissembling Fates !</l>
       <l n="30">They show 'd their favours to conceal their hates ,</l>
       <l n="31">And draw Leander on , lest seas too high</l>
       <l n="32">Should stay his too obsequious destiny :</l>
       <l n="33">Who like a fleering slavish parasite ,</l>
       <l n="34">In warping profit or a traitorous sleight ,</l>
       <l n="35">Hoops round his rotten body with devotes ,</l>
       <l n="36">And pricks his descant face full of false notes ;</l>
       <l n="37">Praising with open throat , and oaths as foul</l>
       <l n="38">As his false heart , the beauty of an owl ;</l>
       <l n="39">Kissing his skipping hand with charmed skips ,</l>
       <l n="40">That cannot leave , but leaps upon his lips</l>
       <l n="41">Like a cock-sparrow , or shameless quean</l>
       <l n="42">Sharp at a red-lipp 'd youth , and naught doth mean</l>
       <l n="43">Of all his antic shows , but doth repair</l>
       <l n="44">More tender fawns , and takes a scatter 'd hair</l>
       <l n="45">From his tame subject 's shoulder ; whips and calls</l>
       <l n="46">For everything he lacks ; creeps ‘ gainst the walls</l>
       <l n="47">With backward humbless , to give needless way :</l>
       <l n="48">Thus his false fate did with Leander play .</l>
       <l n="49">First to black Eurus flies the white Leucote .</l>
       <l n="50">( Born ‘ mongst the negroes in the Levant sea ,</l>
       <l n="51">On whose curl 'd head [ s ] the glowing sun doth rise ,)</l>
       <l n="52">And shows the sovereign will of Destinies ,</l>
       <l n="53">To have him cease his blasts ; and down he lies .</l>
       <l n="54">Next , to the fenny Notus course she holds ,</l>
       <l n="55">And found him leaning , with his arms in folds ,</l>
       <l n="56">Upon a rock , his white hair full of showers ;</l>
       <l n="57">And him she chargeth by the fatal powers ,</l>
       <l n="58">To hold in his wet cheeks his cloudy voice .</l>
       <l n="59">To Zephyr then that doth in flowers rejoice :</l>
       <l n="60">To snake-foot Boreas next she did remove ,</l>
       <l n="61">And found him tossing of his ravish 'd love ,</l>
       <l n="62">To heat his frosty bosom hid in snow ;</l>
       <l n="63">Who with Leucote 's sight did cease to blow .</l>
       <l n="64">Thus all were still to Hero 's heart 's desire ;</l>
       <l n="65">Who with all speed did consecrate a fire</l>
       <l n="66">Of flaming gums and comfortable spice ,</l>
       <l n="67">To light her torch , which in such curious price</l>
       <l n="68">She held , being object to Leander 's sight ,</l>
       <l n="69">That naught but fires perfum 'd must give it light .</l>
       <l n="70">She lov 'd it so , she griev 'd to see it burn ,</l>
       <l n="71">Since it would waste , and soon to ashes turn :</l>
       <l n="72">Yet , if it burn 'd not , ‘ twere not worth her eyes ;</l>
       <l n="73">What made it nothing , gave it all the prize .</l>
       <l n="74">Sweet torch , true glass of our society !</l>
       <l n="75">What man does good , but he consumes thereby ?</l>
       <l n="76">But thou wert lov 'd for good , held high , given show ;</l>
       <l n="77">Poor virtue loath 'd for good , obscur 'd , held low :</l>
       <l n="78">Do good , be pin 'd ,— be deedless good , disgrac 'd ;</l>
       <l n="79">Unless we feed on men , we let them fast .</l>
       <l n="80">Yet Hero with these thoughts her torch did spend :</l>
       <l n="81">When bees make wax , Nature doth not intend</l>
       <l n="82">It should be made a torch ; but we , that know</l>
       <l n="83">The proper virtue of it , make it so ,</l>
       <l n="84">And , when ‘ tis made , we light it : nor did Nature</l>
       <l n="85">Propose one life to maids ; but each such creature</l>
       <l n="86">Makes by her soul the best of her true state ,</l>
       <l n="87">Which without love is rude , disconsolate ,</l>
       <l n="88">And wants love 's fire to make it mild and bright ,</l>
       <l n="89">Till when , maids are but torches wanting light .</l>
       <l n="90">Thus ‘ gainst our grief , not cause of grief , we fight :</l>
       <l n="91">The right of naught is glean 'd , but the delight .</l>
       <l n="92">Up went she : but to tell how she descended ,</l>
       <l n="93">Would God she were not dead , or my verse ended !</l>
       <l n="94">She was the rule of wishes , sum , and end ,</l>
       <l n="95">For all the parts that did on love depend :</l>
       <l n="96">Yet cast the torch his brightness further forth ;</l>
       <l n="97">But what shines nearest best , holds truest worth .</l>
       <l n="98">Leander did not through such tempests swim</l>
       <l n="99">To kiss the torch , although it lighted him :</l>
       <l n="100">But all his powers in her desires awaked ,</l>
       <l n="101">Her love and virtues cloth 'd him richly naked .</l>
       <l n="102">Men kiss but fire that only shows pursue ;</l>
       <l n="103">Her torch and Hero , figure show and virtue .</l>
       <l n="104">Now at oppos 'd Abydos naught was heard</l>
       <l n="105">But bleating flocks , and many a bellowing herd ,</l>
       <l n="106">Slain for the nuptials ; cracks of falling woods ;</l>
       <l n="107">Blows of broad axes ; pourings out of floods .</l>
       <l n="108">The guilty Hellespont was mix 'd and stain 'd</l>
       <l n="109">With bloody torrent that the shambles rain 'd ;</l>
       <l n="110">Not arguments of feast , but shows that bled ,</l>
       <l n="111">Foretelling that red night that followed .</l>
       <l n="112">More blood was spilt , more honours were addrest ,</l>
       <l n="113">Than could have graced any happy feast ;</l>
       <l n="114">Rich banquets , triumphs , every pomp employs</l>
       <l n="115">His sumptuous hand ; no miser 's nuptial joys .</l>
       <l n="116">Air felt continual thunder with the noise</l>
       <l n="117">Made in the general marriage-violence ;</l>
       <l n="118">And no man knew the cause of this expense ,</l>
       <l n="119">But the two hapless lords , Leander 's sire ,</l>
       <l n="120">And poor Leander , poorest where the fire</l>
       <l n="121">Of credulous love made him most rich surmis 'd :</l>
       <l n="122">As short was he of that himself so priz 'd ,</l>
       <l n="123">As is an empty gallant full of form ,</l>
       <l n="124">That thinks each look an act , each drop a storm ,</l>
       <l n="125">That falls from his brave breathings ; most brought up</l>
       <l n="126">In our metropolis , and hath his cup</l>
       <l n="127">Brought after him to feasts ; and much palm bears</l>
       <l n="128">For his rare judgment in th ’ attire he wears ;</l>
       <l n="129">Hath seen the hot Low-Countries , not their heat ,</l>
       <l n="130">Observe their rampires and their buildings yet ;</l>
       <l n="131">And , for your sweet discourse with mouths , is heard</l>
       <l n="132">Giving instructions with his very beard ;</l>
       <l n="133">Hath gone with an ambassador , and been</l>
       <l n="134">A great man 's mate in travelling , even to Rhene ;</l>
       <l n="135">And then puts all his worth in such a face</l>
       <l n="136">As he saw brave men make , and strives for grace</l>
       <l n="137">To get his news forth : as when you descry</l>
       <l n="138">A ship , with all her sail contends to fly</l>
       <l n="139">Out of the narrow Thames with winds unapt ,</l>
       <l n="140">Now crosseth here , then there , then his way rapt ,</l>
       <l n="141">And then hath one point reach 'd , then alters all ,</l>
       <l n="142">And to another crooked reach doth fall</l>
       <l n="143">Of half a bird-bolt 's shoot , keeping more coil</l>
       <l n="144">Than if she danc 'd upon the ocean 's toil ;</l>
       <l n="145">So serious is his trifling company ,</l>
       <l n="146">In all his swelling ship of vacantry ,</l>
       <l n="147">And so short of himself in his high thought</l>
       <l n="148">Was our Leander in his fortunes brought ,</l>
       <l n="149">And in his fort of love that he thought won ;</l>
       <l n="150">But otherwise he scorns comparison .</l>
       <l n="151">O sweet Leander , thy large worth I hide</l>
       <l n="152">In a short grave ! ill-favour 'd storms must chide</l>
       <l n="153">Thy sacred favour ; I in floods of ink</l>
       <l n="154">Must drown thy graces , which white papers drink ,</l>
       <l n="155">Even as thy beauties did the foul black seas ;</l>
       <l n="156">I must describe the hell of thy decease ,</l>
       <l n="157">That heaven did merit : yet I needs must see</l>
       <l n="158">Our painted fools and cockhorse peasantry</l>
       <l n="159">Still , still usurp , with long lives , loves , and lust ,</l>
       <l n="160">The seats of Virtue , cutting short as dust</l>
       <l n="161">Her dear-bought issue : ill to worse converts ,</l>
       <l n="162">And tramples in the blood of all deserts .</l>
       <l n="163">Night close and silent now goes fast before</l>
       <l n="164">The captains and the soldiers to the shore ,</l>
       <l n="165">On whom attended the appointed fleet</l>
       <l n="166">At Sestos ’ bay , that should Leander meet ,</l>
       <l n="167">Who feign 'd he in another ship would pass :</l>
       <l n="168">Which must not be , for no one mean there was</l>
       <l n="169">To get his love home , but the course he took .</l>
       <l n="170">Forth did his beauty for his beauty look ,</l>
       <l n="171">And saw her through her torch , as you behold</l>
       <l n="172">Sometimes within the sun a face of gold ,</l>
       <l n="173">Form 'd in strong thoughts , by that tradition 's force</l>
       <l n="174">That says a god sits there and guides his course .</l>
       <l n="175">His sister was with him ; to whom he show 'd</l>
       <l n="176">His guide by sea , and said , “ Oft have you view 'd</l>
       <l n="177">In one heaven many stars , but never yet</l>
       <l n="178">In one star many heavens till now were met .</l>
       <l n="179">See , lovely sister ! see , now Hero shines ,</l>
       <l n="180">No heaven but her appears ; each star repines ,</l>
       <l n="181">And all are clad in clouds , as if they mourn 'd</l>
       <l n="182">To be by influence of earth out-burn 'd .</l>
       <l n="183">Yet doth she shine , and teacheth Virtue 's train</l>
       <l n="184">Still to be constant in hell 's blackest reign ,</l>
       <l n="185">Though even the gods themselves do so entreat them</l>
       <l n="186">As they did hate , and earth as she would eat them . ”</l>
       <l n="187">Off went his silken robe , and in he leapt ,</l>
       <l n="188">Whom the kind waves so licorously cleapt ,</l>
       <l n="189">Thickening for haste , one in another , so ,</l>
       <l n="190">To kiss his skin , that he might almost go</l>
       <l n="191">To Hero 's tower , had that kind minute lasted .</l>
       <l n="192">But now the cruel Fates with Até hasted</l>
       <l n="193">To all the Winds , and made them battle fight</l>
       <l n="194">Upon the Hellespont , for either 's right</l>
       <l n="195">Pretended to the windy monarchy ;</l>
       <l n="196">And forth they brake , the seas mix 'd with the sky ,</l>
       <l n="197">And toss 'd distress 'd Leander , being in hell ,</l>
       <l n="198">As high as heaven : bliss not in height doth dwell .</l>
       <l n="199">The Destinies sate dancing on the waves ,</l>
       <l n="200">To see the glorious Winds with mutual braves</l>
       <l n="201">Consume each other : O , true glass , to see</l>
       <l n="202">How ruinous ambitious statists be</l>
       <l n="203">To their own glories ! Poor Leander cried</l>
       <l n="204">For help to sea-born Venus she denied ;</l>
       <l n="205">To Boreas , that , for his Atthæa 's sake ,</l>
       <l n="206">He would some pity on his Hero take ,</l>
       <l n="207">And for his own love 's sake , on his desires ;</l>
       <l n="208">But Glory never blows cold Pity 's fires .</l>
       <l n="209">Then call 'd he Neptune , who , through all the noise ,</l>
       <l n="210">Knew with affright his wreck 'd Leander 's voice ,</l>
       <l n="211">And up he rose ; for haste his forehead hit</l>
       <l n="212">‘ Gainst heaven 's hard crystal ; his proud waves he smit</l>
       <l n="213">With his fork 'd sceptre , that could not obey ;</l>
       <l n="214">Much greater powers than Neptune 's gave them sway .</l>
       <l n="215">They lov 'd Leander so , in groans they brake</l>
       <l n="216">When they came near him ; and such space did take</l>
       <l n="217">‘ Twixt one another , loath to issue on ,</l>
       <l n="218">That in their shallow furrows earth was shown ,</l>
       <l n="219">And the poor lover took a little breath :</l>
       <l n="220">But the curst Fates sate spinning of his death</l>
       <l n="221">On every wave , and with the servile Winds</l>
       <l n="222">Tumbled them on him . And now Hero finds ,</l>
       <l n="223">By that she felt , her dear Leander 's state :</l>
       <l n="224">She wept , and pray 'd for him to every Fate ;</l>
       <l n="225">And every Wind that whipp 'd her with her hair</l>
       <l n="226">About the face , she kiss 'd and spake it fair ,</l>
       <l n="227">Kneel 'd to it , gave it drink out of her eyes</l>
       <l n="228">To quench his thirst : but still their cruelties</l>
       <l n="229">Even her poor torch envi 'd , and rudely beat</l>
       <l n="230">The baiting flame from that dear food it eat ;</l>
       <l n="231">Dear , for it nourish 'd her Leander 's life ;</l>
       <l n="232">Which with her robe she rescu 'd from their strife :</l>
       <l n="233">But silk too soft was such hard hearts to break ;</l>
       <l n="234">And , she , dear soul , even as her silk , faint , weak ,</l>
       <l n="235">Could not preserve it ; out , O , out it went !</l>
       <l n="236">Leander still call 'd Neptune , that now rent</l>
       <l n="237">His brackish curls , and tore his wrinkled face ,</l>
       <l n="238">Where tears in billows did each other chase ;</l>
       <l n="239">And , burst with ruth , he hurl 'd his marble mace</l>
       <l n="240">At the stern Fates ; it wounded Lachesis</l>
       <l n="241">That drew Leander 's thread , and could not miss</l>
       <l n="242">The thread itself , as it her hand did hit ,</l>
       <l n="243">But smote it full , and quite did sunder it .</l>
       <l n="244">The more kind Neptune rag 'd , the more he raz 'd</l>
       <l n="245">His love 's life fort , and kill 'd as he embrac 'd :</l>
       <l n="246">Anger doth still his own mishap increase ;</l>
       <l n="247">If any comfort live , it is in peace .</l>
       <l n="248">O thievish Fates , to let blood , flesh , and sense ,</l>
       <l n="249">Build two fair temples for their excellence ,</l>
       <l n="250">To rob it with a poison 'd influence !</l>
       <l n="251">Though souls ’ gifts starve , the bodies are held dear</l>
       <l n="252">In ugliest things ; sense-sport preserves a bear :</l>
       <l n="253">But here naught serves our turns : O heaven and earth ,</l>
       <l n="254">How most-most wretched is our human birth !</l>
       <l n="255">And now did all the tyrannous crew depart ,</l>
       <l n="256">Knowing there was a storm in Hero 's heart ,</l>
       <l n="257">Greater than they could make , and scorn 'd their smart .</l>
       <l n="258">She bow 'd herself so low out of her tower ,</l>
       <l n="259">That wonder ‘ twas she fell not ere her hour ,</l>
       <l n="260">With searching the lamenting waves for him :</l>
       <l n="261">Like a poor snail , her gentle supple limb</l>
       <l n="262">Hung on her turret 's top , so most downright ,</l>
       <l n="263">As she would dive beneath the darkness quite ,</l>
       <l n="264">To find her jewel ;— jewel !— her Leander ,</l>
       <l n="265">A name of all earth 's jewels pleas 'd not her</l>
       <l n="266">Like his dear name : “ Leander , still my choice ,</l>
       <l n="267">Come naught but my Leander ! O my voice ,</l>
       <l n="268">Turn to Leander ! henceforth be all sounds ,</l>
       <l n="269">Accents , and phrases , that show all griefs ’ wounds ,</l>
       <l n="270">Analys 'd in Leander ! O black change !</l>
       <l n="271">Trumpets , do you , with thunder of your clange ,</l>
       <l n="272">Drive out this change 's horror ! My voice faints :</l>
       <l n="273">Where all joy was , now shriek out all complaints ! ”</l>
       <l n="274">Thus cried she ; for her mixed soul could tell</l>
       <l n="275">Her love was dead : and when the Morning fell</l>
       <l n="276">Prostrate upon the weeping earth for woe ,</l>
       <l n="277">Blushes , that bled out of her cheeks , did show</l>
       <l n="278">Leander brought by Neptune , bruis 'd and torn</l>
       <l n="279">With cities ’ ruins he to rocks had worn ,</l>
       <l n="280">To filthy usuring rocks , that would have blood ,</l>
       <l n="281">Though they could get of him no other good .</l>
       <l n="282">She saw him , and the sight was much-much more</l>
       <l n="283">Than might have serv 'd to kill her : should her store</l>
       <l n="284">Of giant sorrows speak ?— Burst ,— die ,— bleed ,</l>
       <l n="285">And leave poor plaints to us that shall succeed .</l>
       <l n="286">She fell on her love 's bosom , hugg 'd it fast ,</l>
       <l n="287">And with Leander 's name she breath 'd her last .</l>
       <l n="288">Neptune for pity in his arms did take them ,</l>
       <l n="289">Flung them into the air , and did awake them</l>
       <l n="290">Like two sweet birds , surnam 'd th ’ Acanthides ,</l>
       <l n="291">Which we call Thistle-warps , that near no seas</l>
       <l n="292">Dare ever come , but still in couples fly ,</l>
       <l n="293">And feed on thistle-tops , to testify</l>
       <l n="294">The hardness of their first life in their last ;</l>
       <l n="295">The first , in thorns of love , that sorrows past :</l>
       <l n="296">And so most beautiful their colours show</l>
       <l n="297">As none ( so little ) like them ; her sad brow</l>
       <l n="298">A sable velvet feather covers quite ,</l>
       <l n="299">Even like the forehead-cloth that , in the night ,</l>
       <l n="300">Or when they sorrow , ladies use to wear :</l>
       <l n="301">Their wings , blue , red , and yellow , mix 'd appear ;</l>
       <l n="302">Colours that , as we construe colours , paint</l>
       <l n="303">Their states to life ;— the yellow shows their saint ,</l>
       <l n="304">The dainty Venus , left them ; blue , their truth ;</l>
       <l n="305">The red and black , ensigns of death and ruth .</l>
       <l n="306">And this true honour from their love-death sprung ,—</l>
       <l n="307">They were the first that ever poet sung .</l>

      <head>DIALOGUE IN VERSE</head>
      <head>First printed in The Alleyn Papers ( for the Shakespeare Society ) , p. 8 , by Payne Collier , who prefaced it with the following remarks : “ In the original MS. this dramatic dialogue in verse is written as prose , on one side of a sheet of paper , at the back of which , in a more modern hand , is the name ‘ Kitt Marlowe . ’ What connection , if any , he may have had with it , it is impossible to determine . ” This Dialogue may be a fragment of The Maiden 's Holiday , a lost comedy , which is said to have been written partly by Marlowe .— DYCE</head>
