    <docImprint>Later collected editions of the works were published in<date>1711</date>( 7 vols . ) ;<date>1750</date>, edited by Lewis Theobald , Thomas Seward and J. Sympson ( 10 vols . ) ;<date>1778</date>, edited by George Colman ( 10 vols . ) ;<date>1812</date>, edited by Henry Weber ( 14 vols . ) ;<date>1843</date>, edited by Alexander Dyce ( 11 vols . ) . It is unnecessary to refer in detail to these later editions which , very widely as they differ among themselves , agree in presenting an eclectic text , a text formed partly by a collation of the various old editions and partly by the adoption of conjectural emendations . During the progress of work upon the present issue another edition has been announced , under the general editorship of Mr A. H. Bullen , and the first volume was published last year . It follows the lines of its predecessors in presenting a modernised text , giving ‘ a fuller record than had been given by Dyce of variæ lectiones , ’ and pleading , in its prospectus , that , ‘ for the use of scholars , there should be editions of all our old authors in old spelling . ’ The objects of the present edition , in accordance with the scheme of the series of ENGLISH CLASSICS of which it is a part , are to provide ( i ) a text in which there shall be no deviation from that adopted as its basis , in the matter of spelling , punctuation , the use of capitals and italics , save as recorded , and to give ( ii ) an apparatus of variant readings as an Appendix , comprising the texts of all the early issues , that is to say , of all editions prior to and including the Second Folio . Within these limits , and apart from mere variations in spelling and punctuation , every variation , whether deemed important or not , is recorded in the Appendixes to these volumes . Of the 52 Plays in the Second Folio only 5 were published before the death of Beaumont and 9 before the death of Fletcher . The text has , therefore , given rise to a fruitful crop of conjectural emendations , but it has not been deemed a part of the editor 's duty to garner them . Leaving these on one side , and desirous mainly of collecting every alternative reading in all the Quartos and in the two Folios , the text used in the preparation of the present edition , chosen after careful consideration , is that of the Second Folio , obvious printers ’ errors being corrected , recorded in the Appendix , and indicated in the text by the insertion of square brackets . This text is the latest with any pretence to authority , it includes all the plays , and it forms a convenient limit , beyond which no notice has been taken of alternative readings , and to which the variants , chronologically arranged from the earliest to the latest Quartos , can easily be referred . Some of the early Quartos no doubt offer better texts of some of the plays , especially in the matter of verse and prose arrangement , and had it been intended to print one text , and one text only , unaccompanied by a full apparatus of variorum readings , something might be said in favour of a choice among the Quartos and Folios , selecting here and there , in the case of each play , the particular text that seemed the best . But such choice could only be an extension of the eclectic method that has been rejected in dealing with alternative readings , it seemed to be equally unscientific , and , in view of the material in the Appendixes , needless . In common with all the Quartos and the First Folio the Second Folio has failings , which will be noted in due course , but these have been exaggerated , and against them may be set the advantages detailed in the address of ‘ The Booksellers to the Reader , ’ reprinted on p. lx . It has been thought that it would be useful to students to give lists of the different arrangements of prose and verse that obtain in the different quartos , and these will be found in the Appendix after the variants of each play . The remaining volumes of this edition will follow as soon as can be arranged . The Syndics of the University Press have asked me to complete the work begun by Arnold Glover . It was a work greatly to his mind : he spent much labour upon it , being always keenly interested in critical , textual and bibliographical work in English literature ; he welcomed a return to his earlier studies among the Elizabethans after five years given to the works of one of their most discerning critics ; but he did not live to see the publication of the first volume of his new work . When he died in the January of this year , the text of volumes one and two had been passed for press , the material accumulated for the Appendixes to those volumes and the draft of the above ‘ Note ’ partly written . With the assistance of Mrs Arnold Glover , who had helped him in the laborious work of collation , I have checked and arranged this editorial material for press . I hope I have not let any error escape me which he would have detected . A. R. WALLER .<settlement>CAMBRIDGE</settlement>, 2 August ,<date>1905</date>.</docImprint>

    <head>Poetry is the Child of Nature , which regulated and made beautifull by Art , presenteth the most Harmonious of all other compositions ; among which ( if we rightly consider ) the Dramaticall is the most absolute , in regard of those transcendent Abilities , which should waite upon the Composer ; who must have more then the instruction of Libraries which of it selfe is but a cold contemplative knowledge there being required in him a Soule miraculously knowing , and conversing with all mankind , inabling him to expresse not onely the Phlegme and folly of thick-skin 'd men , but the strength and maturity of the wise , the Aire and insinuations of the Court , the discipline and Resolution of the Soldier , the Vertues and passions of every noble condition , nay the councells and charailers of the greatest Princes .</head>
    <p n="1">This you will say is a vast comprehension , and hath not hapned in many Ages . Be it then remembred to the Glory of our owne , that all these are Demonstrative and met in BEAUMONT &amp; FLETCHER , whom but to mention is to throw a cloude upon all former names and benight Posterity ; This Book being , without flattery , the greatest Monument of the Scene that Time and Humanity have produced , and must Live , not only the Crowne and sole Reputation of our owne , but the stayne of all other Nations and Languages , for it may be boldly averred , not one indiscretion hath branded this Paper in all the Lines , this being the Authentick witt that made Blackfriers an Academy , where the three howers spectacle while Beaumont and Fletcher were presented , were usually of more advantage to the hopefull young Heire , then a costly , dangerous , forraigne Travell , with the assistance of a governing Mounsieur , or Signior to boot ; And it cannot be denied but that the young spirits of the Time , whose Birth &amp; Quality made them impatient of the sowrer wayes of education , have from the attentive hearing these pieces , got ground in point of wit and carriage of the most severely employed Students , while these Recreations were digested into Rules , and the very Pleasure did edifie . How many passable discoursing dining witts stand yet in good credit upon the bare stock of two or three of these single Scenes .</p>
    <p n="2">And now Reader in this Tragicall Age where the Theater hath been so much out-ailed , congratulate thy owne happinesse , that in this silence of the Stage , thou hast a liberty to reade these inimitable Playes , to dwell and converse in these immortall Groves , which were only shewd our Fathers in a conjuring glasse , as suddenly removed as represented , the Landscrap is now brought home by this optick , and the Presse thought too pregnant before , shall be now look 'd upon as greatest Benefactor to Englishmen , that must acknowledge all the felicity of witt and words to this Derivation .</p>
    <p n="3">You may here find passions raised to that excellent pitch and by such insinuating degrees that you shall not chuse but consent , and &amp; go along with them , finding your self at last grown insensibly the very same person you read , and then stand admiring the subtile Trackes of your engagement . Fall on a Scene of love and you will never believe the writers could have the least roome left in their soules for another passion , peruse a Scene of manly Rage , and you would sweare they cannot be exprest by the same hands , but both are so excellently wrought , you must confesse none , but the same hands , could worke them .</p>
    <p n="4">Would thy Melancholy have a cure ? thou shalt laugh at Democritus himselfe , and but reading one piece of this Comick variety , finde thy exalted fancie in Elizium ; And when thou art sick of this cure , ( for the excesse of delight may too much dilate thy soule ,) thou shalt meete almost in every leafe a soft purling passion or spring of sorrow so powerfully wrought high by the teares of innocence , and wronged Lovers , it shall persuade thy eyes to weepe into the streame , and yet smile when they contribute to their owne ruines .</p>
    <p n="5">Infinitely more might be said of these rare Copies , but let the ingenuous Reader peruse them &amp; he will finde them so able to speake their own worth , that they need not come into the world with a trumpet , since any one of these incomparable pieces well understood will prove a Preface to the rest , and if the Reader can fast the best wit ever trod our English Stage , he will be forced himselfe to become a breathing Panegerick to them all .</p>
    <p n="6">Not to detaine or prepare thee longer , be as capritious and sick-brain 'd , as ignorance &amp; malice can make thee , here thou art rectified , or be as healthfull as the inward calme of an honest Heart , Learning , and Temper can state thy disposition , yet this booke may be thy fortunate concernement and Companion .</p>
    <p n="7">It is not so remote in Time , but very many Gentlemen may remember these Authors &amp; some familiar in their conversation deliver them upon every pleasant occasion so fluent , to talke a Comedy . He must be a bold man that dares undertake to write their Lives . What I have to say is , we have the precious Remaines , and as the wisest contemporaries acknowledge they Lived a Miracle , I am very confident this volume cannot die without one .</p>
    <p n="8">What more specially concerne these Authors and their workes is told thee by another hand in the following Epistle of the Stationer to the Readers .</p>
    <p n="9">Farwell , Reade , and feare not thine owne understanding , this Booke will create a cleare one in thee , and when thou hast considered thy purchase , thou wilt call the price of it a Charity to thy selfe , and at the same time forgive thy friend , and these Authors humble admirer ,</p>
    <p n="10">JA . SHIRLEY .</p>
    <p n="11">The Stationer to the Readers .</p>
    <p n="12">Gentlemen , before you engage farther , be pleased to take notice of these Particulars . You have here a New Booke ; I can speake it clearely ; for of all this large Volume of Comedies and Tragedies , not one , till now , was ever printed before . A Collection of Playes is commonly but a new Impression , the scattered pieces which were printed single , being then onely Republished together : ‘ Tis otherwise here .</p>
    <p n="13">Next , as it is all New , so here is not any thing Spurious or impos 'd ; I had the Originalls from such as received them from the Authours themselves ; by Those , and none other , I publish this Edition .</p>
    <p n="14">And as here 's nothing but what is genuine and Theirs , so you will finde here are no Omissions ; you have not onely All I could get , but All that you must ever expect . For ( besides those which were formerly printed ) there is not any Piece written by these Authours , either Joyntly or Severally , but what are now publish 'd to the World in this Volume . One only Play I must except ( for I meane to deale openly ) ‘ tis a COMEDY called the Wilde-goose Chase , which hath beene long lost , and I feare irrecoverable ; for a Person of Quality borrowed it from the Actours many yeares since , and ( by the negligence of a Servant ) it was never return 'd ; therefore now I put up this Si quis , that whosoever hereafter happily meetes with it , shall be thankfully satisfied if he please to send it home .</p>
    <p n="15">Some Playes ( you know ) written by these Authors were heretofore Printed : I thought not convenient to mixe them with this Volume , which of it selfe is entirely New . And indeed it would have rendred the Booke so Voluminous , that Ladies and Gentlewomen would have found it scarce manageable , who in Workes of this nature must first be remembred . Besides , I considered those former Pieces had been so long printed and re-printed , that many Gentlemen were already furnished ; and I would have none say , they pay twice for the same Booke .</p>
    <p n="16">One thing I must answer before it bee objected ; ‘ tis this : When these Comedies and Tragedies were presented on the Stage , the Actours omitted some Scenes and Passages ( with the Authour 's consent ) as occasion led them ; and when private friends desir 'd a Copy , they then ( and justly too ) transcribed what they Acted . But now you have both All that was Acted , and all that was not ; even the perfect full Originalls without the least mutilation ; So that were the Authours living , ( and sure they can never dye ) they themselves would challenge neither more nor lesse then what is here published ; this Volume being now so compleate and finish 'd , that the Reader must expect no future Alterations .</p>
   </div>
   <titlePage>
    <docImprint>For literall Errours committed by the Printer , ‘ tis the fashion to aske pardon , and as much in fashion to take no notice of him that asks it ; but in this also I have done my endeavour . ‘ Twere vaine to mention the Chargeablenesse of this Work ; for those who own 'd the Manuscripts , too well knew their value to make a cheap estimate of any of these Pieces , and though another joyn 'd with me in the Purchase and Printing , yet the Care &amp; Pains was wholly mine , which I found to be more then you'l easily imagine , unlesse you knew into how many hands the Originalls were dispersed . They are all now happily met in this Book , having escaped these Publike Troubles , free and unmangled . Heretofore when Gentlemen desired but a Copy of any of these Playes , the meanest piece here ( if any may be called Meane where every one is Best ) cost them more then foure times the price you pay for the whole Volume . I should scarce have adventured in these slippery times on such a work as this , if knowing persons had not generally assured mee that these Authors were the most unquestionable Wits this Kingdome hath afforded . Mr. Beaumont was ever acknowledged a man of a most strong and searching braine ; and ( his yeares considered ) the most Judicious Wit these later Ages have produced ; he dyed young , for ( which was an invaluable losse to this Nation ) he left the world when hee was not full thirty yeares old . Mr. Fletcher survived , and lived till almost fifty ; whereof the World now enjoyes the benefit . It was once in my thoughts to have Printed Mr. Fletcher 's workes by themselves , because single &amp; alone he would make a Just Volume : But since never parted while they lived , I conceived it not equitable to seperate their ashes . It becomes not me to say ( though it be a knowne Truth ) that these Authors had not only High unexpressible gifts of Nature , but also excellent acquired Parts , being furnished with Arts and Sciences by that liberall education they had at the University , which sure is the best place to make a great Wit understand it selfe ; this their workes will soone make evident . I was very ambitious to have got Mr. Beaumonts picture ; but could not possibly , though I spared no enquirie in those Noble Families whence he was descended , as also among those Gentlemen that were his acquaintance when he was of the Inner Temple : the best Pictures and those most like him you 'll finde in this Volume . This figure of Mr. Fletcher was cut by severall Originall Pieces , which his friends lent me , but withall they tell me , that his unimitable Soule did shine through his countenance in such Ayre and Spirit , that the Painters confessed , it was not easie to expresse him : As much as could be , you have here , and the Graver hath done his part . What ever I have scene of Mr. Fletchers owne hand , is free from interlining ; and his friends affirme he never writ any one thing twice : it seemes he had that rare felicity to prepare and perfect all first in his owne braine ; to shape and attire his Notions , to adde or loppe off , before he committed one word to writing , and never touched pen till all was to stand as firme and immutable as if ingraven in Brasse or Marble . But I keepe you too long from those friends of his whom ‘ tis fitter for you to read ; only accept of the honest endeavours of One that is a Servant to you all HUMPHREY MOSELEY . At the Princes Armes in St Pauls Church-yard . Feb. 14th<date>1646</date>. To the Stationer . Tell the sad World that now the lab'ring Presse Has brought forth safe a Child of happinesse , The Frontis-piece will satisfie the wise And good so well , they will not grudge the price . ‘ Tis not all Kingdomes joyn 'd in one could buy ( If priz 'd aright ) so true a Library Of man : where we the characters may finde Of ev'ry Nobler and each baser minde . Desert has here reward in one good line For all it lost , for all it might repine : Vile and ignobler things are open laid , The truth of their false colours are displayed : You'l say the Poet 's both best Judge and Priest , No guilty soule abides so sharp a test As their smooth Pen ; for what these rare men writ Commands the World , both Honesty and Wit .</docImprint>

    <docTitle><titlePart>IN MEMORY OF Mr. JOHN FLETCHER . Me thought our Fletcher weary of this croud , Wherein so few have witt , yet all are loud , Unto Elyzium fled , where he alone Might his own witt admire and ours bemoane ; But soone upon those Flowry Bankes , a throng Worthy of those even numbers which he sung , Appeared , and though those Ancient Laureates strive When dead themselves , whose raptures should survive , For his Temples all their owne bayes allowes , Not sham 'd to see him crown 'd with naked browes ; Homer his beautifull Achilles nam 'd , Urging his braine with Joves might well be fam 'd , Since it brought forth one full of beauties charmes , As was his Pallas , and as bold in Armes ; [ - King and no King. -  ] But when he the brave Arbases saw , one That saved his peoples dangers by his own , And saw Tigranes by his hand undon Without the helpe of any Mirmydon , He then confess 'd when next hee 'd Hector slay , That he must borrow him from Fletchers Play ; This might have beene the shame , for which he bid His Iliades in a Nut-shell should be hid : Virgill of his Æneas next begun , Whose God-like forme and tongue so soone had wonne ; That Queene of Carthage and of beauty too , Two powers the whole world else were slaves unto , Urging that Prince for to repaire his faulte On earth , boldly in hell his Mistresse sought ; [ - The Maides Tragedy. -  ] But when he Amintor saw revenge that wrong , For which the sad Aspasia sigh 'd so long , Upon himselfe , to shades hasting away , Not for to make a visit but to stay ; He then did modestly confesse how farr Fletcher out-did him in a Charactar . Now lastly for a refuge , Virgill shewes The lines where Corydon Alexis woes ; But those in opposition quickly met [ - The faithfull Shepherdesse. -  ] The smooth tongu 'd Perigot and Amoret : A paire whom doubtlesse had the others seene , They from their owne loves had Apostates beene ; Thus Fletcher did the fam 'd laureat exceed , Both when his Trumpet sounded and his reed ; Now if the Ancients yeeld that heretofore , None worthyer then those ere Laurell wore ; The least our age can say now thou art gon , Is that there never will be such a one : And since t ’ expresse thy worth , our rimes too narrow be , To help it wee'l be ample in our prophesie .</titlePart></docTitle>

    <docTitle><titlePart>On Mr John Fletcher , and his Workes , never before published . To flatter living fooles is easie slight : But hard , to do the living-dead men right . To praise a Landed Lord , is gainfull art : But thanklesse to pay Tribute to desert . This should have been my taske : I had intent To bring my rubbish to thy monument , To stop some crannies there , but that I found No need of least repaire ; all firme and sound . Thy well-built fame doth still it selfe advance Above the Worlds mad zeale and ignorance , Though thou dyedst not possest of that same pelfe ( Which Nobler soules call durt ,) the City wealth : Yet thou hast left unto the times so great A Legacy , a Treasure so compleat , That ‘ twill be hard I feare to prove thy Will : Men will be wrangling , and in doubting still How so vast summes of wit were left behind , And yet nor debts nor sharers they can finde . ‘ Twas the kind providence of fate , to lock Some of this Treasure up ; and keep a stock For a reserve untill these sullen daies : When scorn , and want , and danger , are the Baies That Crown the head of merit . But now he Who in thy Will hath part , is rich and free . But there 's a Caveat enter 'd by command , None should pretend , but those can understand .</titlePart></docTitle>

     <p>HENRY MODY , Baronet . ON Mr Fletchers Works . Though Poets have a licence which they use As th ’ ancient priviledge of their free Muse ; Yet whether this be leave enough for me To write , great Bard , an Eulogie for thee : Or whether to commend thy Worke , will stand Both with the Lawes of Verse and of the Land , Were to put doubts might raise a discontent Between the Muses and the —— I'le none of that . There 's desperate wits that be ( As their immortall Lawrell ) Thunder-free ; Whose personall vertues , ‘ bove the Lawes of Fate , Supply the roome of personall estate : And thus enfranchis 'd , safely may rehearse , Rapt in a lofty straine , [ their ] own neck-verse . For he that gives the Bayes to thee , must then First take it from the Militarie Men ; He must untriumph conquests , bid ‘ em stand , Question the strength of their victorious hand . He must act new things , or go neer the sin , Reader , as neer as you and I have been : He must be that , which He that tryes will swear I [ t ] is not good being so another Yeare . And now that thy great name I 've brought to [ this ] , To do it honour is to do amisse , What 's to be done to those , that shall refuse To celebrate , great Soule , thy noble Muse ? Shall the poore State of all those wandring things , Thy Stage once rais 'd to Emperors and Kings ? Shall rigid forfeitures ( that reach our Heires ) Of things that only fill with cares and feares ? Shall the privation of a friendlesse life , Made up of contradictions and strife ? Shall He be entitie , would antedate His own poore name , and thine annihilate ? Shall these be judgements great enough for one That dares not write thee an Encomion ? Then where am I ? but now I 've thought upo n't , I'le prayse thee more then all have ventur 'd o n't . I'le take thy noble Work ( and like the trade Where for a heap of Salt pure Gold is layd ) I'le lay thy Volume , that Huge Tome of wit , About in Ladies Closets , where they sit Enthron 'd in their own wills ; and if she bee A Laick sister , shee'l straight flie to thee : But if a holy Habit shee have on , Or be some Novice , shee'l scarce looks upon Thy Lines at first ; but watch Her then a while , And you shall see Her steale a gentle smile Upon thy Title , put thee neerer yet , Breath on thy Lines a whisper , and then set Her voyce up to the measures ; then begin To blesse the houre , and happy state shee 's in . Now shee layes by her Characters , and lookes With a stern eye on all her pretty Bookes . Shee 's now thy Voteresse , and the just Crowne She brings thee with it , is worth half the Towne . I'le send thee to the Army , they that fight Will read thy tragedies with some delight , Be all thy Reformadoes , fancy scars , And pay too , in thy speculative wars . I'le send thy Comick scenes to some of those That for a great while have plaid fast and loose ; New universalists , by changing shapes , Have made with wit and fortune faire escapes . Then shall the Countrie that poor Tennis-ball Of angry fate , receive thy Pastorall , And from it learn those melancholy straines Fed the afflicted soules of Primitive swaines . Thus the whole World to reverence will flock Thy Tragick Buskin and thy Comick Stock ; And winged fame unto posterity Transmit but onely two , this Age , and Thee . THOMAS PEYTON .

    <docTitle><titlePart>Deceased Authour , Mr John Fletcher , his Plays ; and especially , The Mad Lover . Whilst his well organ 'd body doth retreat , To its first matter , and the formall heat Triumphant sits in judgement to approve Pieces above our Candour and our love : Such as dare boldly venter to appeare Unto the curious eye , and Criticke eare : Lo the Mad Lover in these various times Is pressed to life , t ’ accuse us of our crimes . While Fletcher liv 'd , who equall to him writ Such lasting Monuments of naturall wit ? Others might draw : their lines with sweat , like those That ( with much paines ) a Garrison inclose ; Whilst his sweet fluent veine did gently runne As uncontrold , and smoothly as the Sun . After his death our Theatres did make Him in his own unequald Language speake : And now when all the Muses out of their Approved modesty silent appeare , This Play of Fletchers braves the envious light As wonder of our eares once , now our sight . Three and fourfold blest Poet , who the Lives Of Poets , and of Theaters survives ! A Groome , or Ostler of some wit may bring His Pegasus to the Castalian spring ; Boast he a race o 're the Pharsalian plaine , Or happy Tempe valley dares maintaine : Brag at one leape upon the double Cliffe ( Were it as high as monstrous Tennariffe ) Of farre-renown 'd Parnassus he will get , And there ( t ’ amaze the World ) confirme his state : When our admired Fletcher vaunts not ought , And slighted everything he writ as naught : While all our English wondring world ( in 's cause ) Made this great City eccho with applause . Read him therefore all that can read , and those That cannot learne , if y ’ are not Learnings foes , And wilfully resolved to refuse The gentle Raptures of this happy Muse . From thy great constellation ( noble Soule ) Looke on this Kingdome , suffer not the whole Spirit of Poesie retire to Heaven , But make us entertains what thou hast given . Earthquakes and Thunder Diapasons make The Seas vast roare , and irresistlesse shake Of horrid winds , a sympathy compose ; So in these things there 's musicke in the close : And though they seem great Discords in our eares , They are not so to them above the Spheares . Granting these Musicke , how much sweeter 's that Mnemosyne 's daughter 's voyces doe create ? Since Heaven , and Earth , and Seas , and Ayre consent To make an Harmony ( the Instrument , Their man agreeing selves ) shall we refuse The Musicke which the Deities doe use ? Troys ravisht Ganymed doth sing to Jove , And Phoebus selfe playes on his Lyre above . The Cretan Gods , or glorious men , who will Imitate right , must wonder at thy skill , Best Poet of thy times , or he will prove As mad as thy brave Memnon was with love .</titlePart></docTitle>

     <p>ASTON COKAINE , Baronet . Upon the Works of BEAUMONT , and FLETCHER . How Angels ( cloyster 'd in our humane Cells ) Maintaine their parley , Beaumont-Fletcher tels ; Whose strange unimitable Intercourse Transcends all Rules , and flyes beyond the force Of the most forward soules ; all must submit Untill they reach these Mysteries of Wit . The Intellectuall Language here 's exprest , Admir 'd in better times , and dares the Test Of Ours ; for from Wit , Sweetnesse , Mirth , and Sence , This Volume springs a new true Quintessence . JO . PETTUS , Knight . On the Works of the most excellent Dramatick Poet , Mr. John F [ l ] etcher , never before Printed . Haile Fletcher , welcome to the worlds great Stage ; For our two houres , we have thee here an age In thy whole Works , and may th ’ Impression call The Pretor that presents thy Playes to all : Both to the People , and the Lords that sway That Herd , and Ladies whom those Lords obey . And what 's the Loadstone can such guests invite But moves on two Poles , Profit and Delight , Which will be soon , as on the Rack , confest When every one is tickled with a jest : And that pure Fletcher , able to subdue A Melancholy more then Burton knew . And though upon the by , to his designes The Native may learne English from his lines , And th ’ Alien if he can but construe it , May here be made free Denison of wit . But his maine end does drooping Vertue raise , And crownes her beauty with eternall Bayes ; In Scænes where she inflames the frozen soule , While Vice ( her paint washt off ) appeares so foule ; She must this Blessed Isle and Europe leave , And some new Quadrant of the Globe deceive : Or hide her Blushes on the Affrike shore Like Marius , but ne 're rise to triumph more ; That honour is resign 'd to Fletchers fame ; Adde to his Trophies , that a Poets name ( Late growne as odious to our Moderne states As that of King to Rome ) he vindicates From black aspertions , cast upo n't by those Which only are inspir 'd to lye in prose . And , By the Court of Muses be't decreed , What graces spring from Poesy 's richer seed , When we name Fletcher shall be so proclaimed , As all that 's Royall is when Cæsar 's nam 'd . ROBERT STAPYLTON Knight . To the memory of my most honoured kinsman , Mr. Francis Beaumont . I'le not pronounce how strong and cleane thou writes , Nor by what new hard Rules thou took'st thy Flights , Nor how much Greek and Latin some refine Before they can make up six words of thine , But this I'le say , thou strik'st our sense so deep , At once thou mak'st us Blush , Rejoyce , and Weep . Great Father Johnson bow 'd himselfe when hee ( Thou writ'st so nobly ) vow 'd he envy 'd thee . Were thy Mardonius arm 'd , there would be more Strife for his Sword then all Achilles wore , Such wise just Rage , had Hee been lately tryd My life o n't Hee had been o'th ’ Better side , And where hee found false odds , ( through Gold or Sloath ) There brave Mardonius would have beat them Both . Behold , here 's FLETCHER too ! the World ne 're knew Two Potent Witts co-operate till You ; For still your fancies are so wov'n and knit , ‘ Twas FRANCIS FLETCHER , or JOHN BEAUMONT writ . Yet neither borrow 'd , nor were so put to't To call poore Godds and Goddesses to do't ; Nor made Nine Girles your Muses ( you suppose Women ne 're write , save Love-Letters in prose ) But are your owne Inspirers , and have made Such pow'rfull Sceanes , as when they please , invade . Tour Plot , Sence , Language , All 's so pure and fit , Hee 's Bold , not Valiant , dare dispute your Wit . GEORGE LISLE Knight .</p>

So shall we joy , when all whom Beasts and Wormes Had turned to their owne substances and formes , Whom Earth to Earth , or fire hath chang 'd to fire , Wee shall behold more then at first intire As now we doe , to see all thine , thine owne In this thy Muses Resurrection , Whose scattered parts , from thy owne Race , more wounds Hath suffer 'd , then Acteon from his hounds ; Which first their Braines , and then their Bellies fed , And from their excrements new Poets bred . But now thy Muse inraged from her urne Like Ghosts of Murdred bodyes doth returne To accuse the Murderers , to right the Stage , And undeceive the long abused Age , Which casts thy praise on them , to whom thy Wit Gives not more Gold then they give drosse to it : Who not content like fellons to purloyne , Adde Treason to it , and debase thy Coyne . But whither am I strayd ? I need not raise Trophies to thee from other Mens dispraise ; Nor is thy fame on lesser Ruines built , Nor needs thy juster title the foule guilt Of Easterne Kings , who to secure their Raigne , Must have their Brothers , Sonnes , and Kindred slaine . Then was wits Empire at the fatall height , When labouring and sinking with its weight , From thence a thousand lesser Poets sprong Like petty Princes from the fall of Rome . When JOHNSON , SHAKESPEARE , and thy selfe did sit , And sway 'd in the Triumvirate of wit — Yet what from JOHNSONS oyle and sweat did flow , Or what more easie nature did bestow On SHAKESPEARES gentler Muse , in thee full growne Their Graces both appeare , yet so , that none Can say here Nature ends , and Art begins But mixt like th'Elemcnts , and borne like twins , So interweav 'd , so like , so much the same , None this meere Nature , that meere Art can name : ‘ Twas this the Ancients meant , Nature and Skill Are the two topps of their Pernassus Hill .</titlePart></docTitle>

    <docTitle><titlePart>Upon Mr. John Fletcher 's Playes . Fletcher , to thee , wee doe not only owe All these good Playes , but those of others too : Thy wit repeated , does support the Stage , Credits the last and entertaines this age . No Worthies form 'd by any Muse but thine Could purchase Robes to make themselves so fine : What brave Commander is not proud to see Thy brave Melantius in his Gallantry , Our greatest Ladyes love to see their scorne Out done by Thine , in what themselves have worne : Th'impatient Widow ere the yeare be done Sees thy Aspasia weeping in her Gowne : I never yet the Tragick straine assay 'd Deterr 'd by that inimitable Maid : And when I venture at the Comick stile Thy Scornfull Lady seemes to mock my toile : Thus has thy Muse , at once , improv 'd and marr 'd Our Sport in Playes , by rendring it too hard . So when a sort of lusty Shepheards throw The barre by turns , and none the rest outgoe So farre , but that the best are measuring casts , Their emulation and their pastime lasts ; But if some Brawny yeoman , of the guard Step in and tosse the Axeltree a yard Or more beyond the farthest Marke , the rest Despairing stand , their sport is at the best .</titlePart></docTitle>

Heald wounded States ? made Kings and Kingdomes one ? That Fate should be so mercifull to me , To let me live t'have said I have read thee . Faire Star ascend ! the Joy ! the Life ! the Light Of this tempestuous Age , this darke worlds sight ! Oh from thy Crowne of Glory dart one flame May strike a sacred Reverence , whilest thy Name ( Like holy Flamens to their God of Day ) We bowing , sing ; and whilst we praise , we pray . Bright Spirit ! whose Æternall motion Of Wit , like Time still in it selfe did runne ; Binding all others in it and did give Commission , how far this , or that shall live : Like Destinie of Poems , who , as she Signes death to all , her selfe can never dye . And now thy purple-robed Tragoedie , In her imbroiderd Buskins , calls mine eye , Where brave Atëius we see betrayed , [ - Valentinian - ] T'obey his Death , whom thousand lives obeyed ; Whilst that the Mighty Foole his Scepter breakes , And through his Gen'rals wounds his owne dooms speaks , Weaving thus richly Valentinian The costliest Monarch with the cheapest man . Souldiers may here to their old glories adde , [ - The Mad Lover. -  ] The Lover love , and be with reason mad : Not as of old , Alcides furious , Who wilder then his Bull did teare the house , ( Hurling his Language with the Canvas stone ) ‘ Twas thought the Monster roar 'd the sob'rer Tone . But ah , when thou thy sorrow didst inspire [ - Tragi-comedies. -  ] With Passions , blacke as is her darke attire , Virgins as Sufferers have wept to see [ - Arcas. -  ] So white a Soule , so red a Crueltie ; [ - Bellario. -  ] That thou hast grieved , and with unthought redresse , Dri 'd their wet eyes who now thy mercy blesse ; Yet loth to lose thy watry Jewell , when [ - Comedies. -  ] Joy wip't it off , Laughter straight sprung't agen . [ - The Spanish Curate. -  ] Now ruddy-cheeked Mirth with Rosie wings , Fanns ev'ry brow with gladnesse , whilest she sings [ - The Humorous Lieutenant. -  ] Delight to all , and the whole Theatre A Festivall in Heaven doth appeare : Nothing but Pleasure , Love , and ( like the Morne ) [ - The Tamer Tam 'd. -  ] Each face a generall smiling doth adorne . [ - The little french Lawyer. -  ] Heare ye foule Speakers , that pronounce the Aire [ The custom of the Countrey - ] Of Stewes and Shores , I will informe you where And how to cloathe aright your wanton wit , Without her nasty Bawd attending it . View here a loose thought said with such a grace , Minerva might have spoke in Venus face ; So well disguis 'd , that t'was conceiv 'd by none But Cupid had Diana 's linnen on ; And all his naked parts so vail 'd , th ’ expresse The Shape with clowding the uncomlinesse ; That if this Reformation which we Receiv 'd , had not been buried with thee , The Stage ( as this work ) might have liv 'd and lov 'd ; Her Lines ; the austere Skarlet had approv 'd , And th ’ Actors wisely been from that offence As cleare , as they are now from Audience . Thus with thy Genius did the Scæne expire , Wanting thy Active and inliv'ning fire , That now ( to spread a darknesse over all ,) Nothing remaines but Poesie to fall . And though from these thy Embers we receive Some warmth , so much as may be said , we live , That we dare praise thee , blushlesse , in the head Of the best piece Hermes to Love e 're read , That We rejoyce and glory in thy Wit , And feast each other with remembring it , That we dare speak thy thought , thy Acts recite : Yet all men henceforth be afraid to write .

    <docTitle><titlePart>On Master JOHN FLETCHERS Dramaticall Poems . Great tutelary Spirit of the Stage ! FLETCHER ! I can fix nothing but my rage Before thy Workes , ‘ gainst their officious crime Who print thee now , in the worst scæne of Time . For me , uninterrupted hadst thou slept Among the holly shades and close hadst kept The mistery of thy lines , till men might bee Taught how to reade , and then , how to reade thee . But now thou art expos 'd to th ’ common fate , Revive then ( mighty Soule ! ) and vindicate From th ’ Ages rude affronts thy injured fame , Instruct the Envious , with how chast a flame Thou warmst the Lover ; how severely just Thou wert to punish , if he burnt to lust . With what a blush thou didst the Maid adorne , But tempted , with how innocent a scorne . How Epidemick errors by thy Play Were laught out of esteeme , so purged away . How to each sence thou so didst vertue fit , That all grew vertuous to be thought t ’ have wit . But this was much too narrow for thy art , Thou didst frame governments , give Kings their part , Teach them how neere to God , while just they be ; But how dissolved , stretcht forth to Tyrannie . How Kingdomes , in their channell , safely run , But rudely overflowing are undone . Though vulgar spirits Poets scorne or hate ; Man may beget , A Poet can create .</titlePart></docTitle>

     <p>WILL . HABINGTON . Upon Master FLETCHERS Dramaticall Workes . What ? now the Stage is down , darst thou appeare Bold FLETC [ H ] ER in this tottr'ing Hemisphear ? Yes ; Poets are like Palmes which , the more weight You cast upon them , grow more strong &amp; streight , ‘ Tis not love 's Thunderbolt , nor Mars his Speare , Or Neptune 's angry Trident , Poets fear . Had now grim BEN bin breathing , ‘ with what rage , And high-swolne fury had Hee lash 'd this age , SHAKESPEARE with CHAPMAN had grown madd , and torn Their gentle Sock , and lofty Buskins worne , To make their Muse welter up to the chin In blood ; of faigned Scenes no need had bin , England like Lucians Eagle with an Arrow Of her owne Plumes piercing her heart quite thorow , Had bin a Theater and subject fit To exercise in real truth 's their wit : Tet none like high-wing 'd FLETCHER had bin found This Eagles tragick-destiny to sound , Rare FLETCHER 'S quill had soar 'd up to the sky , And drawn down Gods to see the tragedy : Live famous Dramatist , let every spring Make thy Bay flourish , and fresh Bourgeons bring : And since we cannot have Thee trod o'th ’ stage , Wee will applaud Thee in this silent Page . JA . HOWELL . P. C. C . On the Edition . Fletcher ( whose Fame no Age can ever wast ; Envy of Ours , and glory of the last ) Is now alive againe ; and with his Name His sacred Ashes wak 'd into a Flame ; Such as before did by a secret charme The wildest Heart subdue , the coldest warme , And lend the Lady 's eyes a power more bright , Dispensing thus to either , Heat and Light . He to a Sympathie those soules betrai 'd Whom Love or Beauty never could perswade ; And in each mov 'd spectatour could beget A reall passion by a Counterfeit : When first Bellario bled , what Lady there Did not for every drop let fall a teare ? And when Aspasia wept , not any eye But seem 'd to weare the same sad livery ; By him inspired the feigned Lucina drew More streams of melting sorrow then the true ; But then the Scornfull Lady did beguile Their easie griefs , and teach them all to smile . Thus he Affections could , or raise or lay ; Love , Griefe and Mirth thus did his Charmes obey : He Nature taught her passions to out-doe , How to refine the old , and create new ; Which such a happy likenesse seem 'd to beare , As if that Nature Art , Art Nature were . Yet All had Nothing bin , obscurely kept In the same Urne wherein his Dust hath slept , Nor had he ris ’ the Delphick wreath to claime , Had not the dying sceane expired his Name ; Dispaire our joy hath doubled , he is come , Thrice welcome by this Post-liminium . His losse preserved him ; They that silenc 'd Wit , Are now the Authours to Eternize it ; Thus Poets are in spight of Fate revived , And Playes by Intermission longer liv 'd . THO . STANLEY .</p>

    <docTitle><titlePart>On the Edition of Mr Francis Beaumonts , and Mr John Fletchers PLAYES never printed before . I Am amaz 'd ; and this same Extacye Is both my Glory and Apology . Sober Joyes are dull Passions ; they must beare Proportion to the Subject : if so ; where Beaumont and Fletcher shall vouchsafe to be That Subject ; That Joy must be Extacye . Fury is the Complexion of great Wits ; The Fooles Distemper : Hee , thats mad by fits , Is wise so too . It is the Poets Muse ; The Prophets God : the Fooles , and my excuse . For ( in Me ) nothing lesse then Fletchers Name Could have begot , or justify 'd this flame . Beaumont } Fletcher } Return 'd ? methinks it should not be . No , not in 's Works : Playes are as dead as He . The Palate of this age gusts nothing High ; That has not Custard i n't or Bawdery . Folly and Madnesse fill the Stage : The Scæne Is Athens ; where , the Guilty , and the Meane , The Foole ‘ scapes well enough ; Learned and Great , Suffer an Ostracisme ; stand Exulate . Mankinde is fall'n againe , shrunke a degree , A step below his very Apostacye . Nature her Selfe is out of Tune ; and Sicke Of Tumult and Disorder , Lunatique . Yet what World would not cheerfully endure The Torture , or Disease , t ’ enjoy the Cure ? This Booke 's the Balsame , and the Hellebore , Must preserve bleeding Nature , and restore Our Crazy Stupor to a just quick Sence Both of Ingratitude , and Providence . That teaches us ( at Once ) to feele , and know , Two deep Points : what we want , and what we owe . Yet Great Goods have their Ills : Should we transmit To Future Times , the Pow'r of Love and Wit , In this Example : would they not combine To make Our Imperfections Their Designe ? They 'd study our Corruptions ; and take more Care to be Ill , then to be Good , before . For nothing but so great Infirmity , Could make Them worthy of such Remedy . Have you not scene the Suns almighty Ray Rescue th ’ affrighted World , and redeeme Day From blacke despaire : how his victorious Beame Scatters the Storme , and drownes the petty flame Of Lightning , in the glory of his eye : How full of pow'r , how full of Majesty ? When to us Mortals , nothing else was knowne , But the sad doubt , whether to burne , or drowne . Choler , and Phlegme , Heat , and dull Ignorance , Have cast the people into such a Trance , That feares and danger seeme Great equally , And no dispute left now , but how to dye . Just in this nicke , Fletcher sets the world cleare Of all disorder and reformes us here . The formall Youth , that knew no other Grace , Or Value , but his Title , and his Lace , Glasses himselfe : and in this faithfull Mirrour , Views , disaproves , reformes , repents his Errour . The Credulous , bright Girle , that beleeves all Language , ( in Othes ) if Good , Canonicall , Is fortifi 'd , and taught , here , to beware Of ev'ry specious bayte , of ev'ry snare Save one : and that same Caution takes her more , Then all the flattery she felt before . She finds her Boxes , and her Thoughts betray 'd By the Corruption of the Chambermaide : Then throwes her Washes and dissemblings By ; And Vowes nothing but Ingenuity . The severe States-man quits his sullen forme Of Gravity and bus'nesse ; The Luke-warme Religious his Neutrality ; The hot Braine-sicke Illuminate his zeale ; The Sot Stupidity ; The Souldier his Arreares ; The Court its Confidence ; The Plebs their feares ; Gallants their Apishnesse and Perjurie , Women their Pleasure and Inconstancie ; Poets their Wine ; the Usurer his Pelfe ; The World its Vanity ; and I my Selfe .</titlePart></docTitle>

       <l n="40">Be't to your praise too , that your Stock and Veyne</l>

       <l n="67">As served like spice , to make them quick and fit ;</l>
       <l n="68">Nor out of mutuall want , or emptinesse ,</l>
       <l n="69">Did you conspire to go still twins to th ’ Presse :</l>
       <l n="70">But what thus joy tied you wrote , might have come forth</l>
       <l n="71">As good from each , and stored with the same worth</l>
       <l n="72">That thus united them , you did joyne sense ,</l>
       <l n="73">In you ‘ twas League , in others impotence ;</l>

       <l n="2">There 's nothing gained by being witty : Fame</l>
       <l n="3">Gathers but winde to blather up a name .</l>
       <l n="4">Orpheus must leave his lyre , or if it be</l>
       <l n="5">In heav'n , ‘ tis there a signe , no harmony ,</l>
       <l n="6">And stones , that follow 'd him , may now become</l>
       <l n="7">Now stones againe , and serve him for his Tomb .</l>
       <l n="8">The Theban Linus , that was ably skil 'd</l>
       <l n="9">In Muse and Musicke , was by Phoebus kill 'd ,</l>
       <l n="10">Though Phoebus did beget him : sure his Art</l>
       <l n="11">Had merited his balsame , not his dart .</l>
       <l n="12">But here Apollo 's jealousie is seene ,</l>
       <l n="13">The god of Physicks troubled with the spleene ;</l>
       <l n="14">Like timerous Kings he puts a period</l>
       <l n="15">To high grown parts lest he should be no God .</l>
       <l n="16">Hence those great Master-wits of Greece that gave</l>
       <l n="17">Life to the world , could not avoid a grave .</l>
       <l n="18">Hence the inspired Prophets of old Rome</l>
       <l n="19">Too great for earth fled to Elizium .</l>
       <l n="20">But the same Ostracisme benighted one ,</l>
       <l n="21">To whom all these were but illusion ;</l>
       <l n="22">It tooke our FLETCHER hence , Fletcher , whose wit</l>
       <l n="23">Was not an accident to th ’ soule , but It ;</l>
       <l n="24">Onely diffused . ( Thus wee the same Sun call ,</l>
       <l n="25">Moving it'h Sphære , and shining on a wall . )</l>
       <l n="26">Wit , so high placed at first , it could not climbe ,</l>
       <l n="27">Wit , that ne 're grew , but only show 'd by time .</l>
       <l n="28">No fier-worke of sacke , no seldome show'n</l>
       <l n="29">Poeticke rage , but still in motion :</l>
       <l n="30">And with far more then Sphericke excellence</l>
       <l n="31">It mov 'd , for ‘ twas its owns Intelligence .</l>
       <l n="32">And yet so obvious to sense , so plaine ,</l>
       <l n="33">You 'd scarcely thinke't allyd unto the braine :</l>
       <l n="34">So sweete , it gained more ground upon the Stage</l>
       <l n="35">Then Johnson with his selfe-admiring rage</l>
       <l n="36">Ere lost : and then so naturally it fell ,</l>
       <l n="37">That fooles would think , that they could doe as well .</l>

       <l n="9">In but preparative to thy Monument ,</l>

       <l n="16">To the sad pomp of his lamented fall ,</l>
       <l n="17">The Common wealth served at his Funerall</l>
       <l n="18">And by a Solemne Order built his Hearse .</l>

       <l n="30">‘ Gainst time and thee he well provided hath ,</l>

       <l n="32">Thus Princes honours : but Witt only gives</l>

       <l n="38">A friendly Elme , by whose tall trunke it shoots</l>

       <l n="42">The blew-cheek 'd grape stuck in its vernant haire</l>
       <l n="43">Hangs like rich Jewells in a beauteous eare .</l>
       <l n="44">So grow our Prayses by thy Witt ; we doe</l>
       <l n="45">Borrow support and strength and lend but show .</l>
       <l n="46">And but thy Male wit like the youthfull Sun</l>
       <l n="47">Strongly begets upon our passion .</l>
       <l n="48">Making our sorrow teeme with Elegie ,</l>
       <l n="49">Thou yet unwep 'd , and yet unprais 'd might'st be .</l>

       <l n="55">That might but parcell of thy worth inherit ;</l>

       <l n="60">Of thine ; which we admir 'd when thou didst sit</l>
       <l n="61">But as a joynt-Commissioner in Wit ;</l>

       <l n="67">Thou wert th ’ Intelligence did move that Sphere .</l>

       <l n="72">No spurious composures amongst thine</l>
       <l n="73">Got in adultery ‘ twixt Witt and Wine .</l>
       <l n="74">And as th ’ Hermeticall Physitians draw</l>
       <l n="75">From things that curse of the first-broken Law ,</l>

       <l n="80">Not like those Meteor-wits which wildly flye</l>
       <l n="81">In storme and thunder through th ’ amazed skie ;</l>
       <l n="82">Speaking but th'Ills and Villanies in a State ,</l>

       <l n="110">The Stage grew narrow while thou grewst to be</l>

       <l n="112">To these a Virgin-modesty which first met</l>

       <l n="117">To their owne Vote and Ingenuity .</l>
       <l n="118">When His faire Shepherdesse on the guilty Stage ,</l>

     <head>READER .</head>
     <p>Courteous Reader , The First Edition of these Plays in this Volume having found that Acceptance as to give us Encouragement to make a Second Impression , we were very desirous they might come forth as Correct as might be . And we were very opportunely informed of a Copy which an ingenious and worthy Gentleman had taken the pains ( or rather the pleasure ) to read over ; wherein he had all along Corrected several faults ( some very gross ) which had crept in by the frequent imprinting of them . His Corrections were the more to be valued , because he had an intimacy with both our Authors , and had been a Spectator of most of them when they were Acted in their life-time . This therefore we resolved to purchase at any Rate ; and accordingly with no small cost obtain 'd it . From the same hand also we received several Prologues and Epilogues , with the Songs appertaining to each Play , which were not in the former Edition , but are now inserted in their proper places . Besides , in this Edition you have the addition of no fewer than Seventeen Plays more than were in the former , which we have taken the pains and care to Collect , and Print out 4to in this Volume , which for distinction sake are markt with a Star in the Catalogue of them facing the first Page of the Book . And whereas in several of the Plays there were wanting the Names of the Persons represented therein , in this Edition you have them all prefixed , with their Qualities ; which will be a great ease to the Reader . Thus every way perfect and compleat have you , all both Tragedies and Comedies that were ever writ by our Authors , a Pair of the greatest Wits and most ingenious Poets of their Age ; from whose worth we should but detract by our most studied Commendations .</p>
     <p>If our care and endeavours to do our Authors right ( in an incorrupt and genuine Edition of their Works ) and thereby to gratifie and oblige the Reader , be but requited with a suitable entertainment , we shall be encouraged to bring Ben . Johnson 's two Volumes into one , and publish them in this form ; and also to reprint Old Shakespear : both which are designed by</p>
     <p>Yours ,</p>
     <p>Ready to serve you ,</p>
