    <head>INTRODUCTION .</head>
    <p n="1">All civilized nations possessing a history which they contemplate with pride endeavour to present that history in an epic form . In their initial stages of culture the vehicles of expression are ballads like the constituents of the Spanish Romanceros and chronicles like Joinville ’ s and Froissart ’ s . With literary refinement comes the distinct literary purpose , and the poet appears who is also more or less of an artist . The number of Spanish and Portuguese national epics , from the Lusiad downwards , during the sixteenth and the first half of the seventeenth centuries , is astonishing ; and it was impossible that English authorship , rapidly acquiring a perception of literary form under classical and foreign influences , should not be powerfully affected by the example of its neighbours .</p>
    <p n="2">A remarkable circumstance , nevertheless , while encouraging this epical impulse , deprived its most important creations of the external epical form . The age of awakened national self-consciousness was also the age of drama . The greatest poetical genius of that or any age , and his associates , were playwrights first and poets afterwards . The torrent of inspiration rushed mainly to the stage . Hence the old experience was reversed , and whereas Æschylus described himself and his fellow-dramatists as subsisting on scraps filched from the great banquet of Homer , our English epic poets could but follow humbly in the wake of the dramatists , the alchemy of whose genius had already turned the dross of ancient chronicles to gold . In the mighty series of Shakespeare ’ s historical plays , including in the enumeration Marlowe ’ s “ Edward the Second ” and the anonymous “ Edward the Third ,” England possesses a national epic inferior to that of no country in the world , although the form be dramatic . In one respect , indeed , this epic is superior to any but the Homeric poems , standing one remove less apart from the poetry of the people . The impression of primitive force which the Homeric poems convey by their venerable language is equally well imparted by Shakespeare ’ s spontaneity and his apparent and probably real innocence of all purely literary intention .</p>
    <p n="3">Epic poets , however gifted , could be but gleaners after such a harvest . Yet not every excellent poet , even of that dramatic age , was endowed with the dramatic faculty , and two of especial merit , singularly devoid of dramatic gift , but inferior to none in love of their country and self-consecration to its service , turned their attention to the epic . These were Samuel Daniel and Michael Drayton . The latter is our subject , but something should also be said of the former . Drayton not unfairly hit the blot in his successful rival when he said of him :</p>
    <p n="4">“ His rimes were smooth , his meeters well did close , But yet his maner better fitted prose .”</p>
    <p n="5">This is one way of putting it ; from another point of view Daniel may be regarded as almost the most remarkable literary phenomenon of his time ; he is so exceedingly modern . He outran the taste of his own period by a hundred years , and without teacher or example displayed the excellences which came to be preferred to all others in the eighteenth century . “ These poems of his ,” says his editor in that age ( 1718 ) , “ having stood the test of above a century , and the language and the versification being still pure and elegant , it is to be hoped they will still shine among his countrymen and preserve his name .” At this time , and for long afterwards , Drayton , save for an occasional reprint of his “ Nimphidia ” among miscellaneous collections , was utterly neglected . Even after the editions of 1748 and 1753 he is alluded to by Goldsmith as a type of the poet whose best title to fame is his tomb in Westminster Abbey .</p>
    <p n="6">The nineteenth century has reversed this with other critical verdicts of the eighteenth , and , with all due respect to Daniel , Drayton now stands higher . Yet , where the two poets come most directly and manifestly into competition , Drayton ’ s superiority is not so evident . As a whole , Daniel ’ s “ Civil War ” is a better poem than Drayton ’ s “ Barons ’ Wars .” The superiority of the latter lies in particular passages , such as the description of the guilty happiness of Isabella and Mortimer , quoted in Mr. Arthur Bullen ’ s admirable selection . This is to say that Drayton ’ s genius was naturally not so much epical as lyrical and descriptive . In his own proper business as a narrative poet he fails as compared with Daniel , but he enriches history with all the ornaments of poetry ; and it was his especial good fortune to discover a subject in which the union of dry fact with copious poetic illustration was as legitimate to the theme as advantageous to the writer . This was , of course , his “ Polyolbion ,” where , doing for himself what no other poet ever did , he did for his country what was never done for any other . Greece and Rome , indeed , have left us versified topographies , but these advance no pretension to the poetical character except from the metrical point of view , though they may in a sense claim kinship with the Muses as the manifest offspring of Mnemosyne . If any modern language possesses a similar work , it has failed to inscribe itself on the roll of the world ’ s literature . The difficulties of Drayton ’ s unique undertaking were in a measure favourable to him . They compelled him to exert his fancy to the uttermost . The tremendous difficulty of making topography into poetry gave him unwonted energy . He never goes to sleep , as too often in the “ Barons ’ Wars .” The stiff practical obstacles attendant upon the poetical treatment of towns and rivers provoke even the dragging Alexandrine into animation ; his stream is often all foam and eddy . The long sweeping line , of its wont so lumbering and tedious , is perfectly in place here . It rushes along like an impetuous torrent , bearing with it , indeed , no inconsiderable quantity of wood , hay , and stubble , but also precious pearls , and more than the dust of gold . Its “ swelling and limitless billows ” mate well with the amplitude of the subject , so varied and spacious that , as has been well said , the “ Polyolbion ” is not a poem to be read through , but to be read in . Nothing in our literature , perhaps , except the “ Faery Queen ,” more perfectly satisfies Keats ’ s desideratum : “ Do not the lovers of poetry like to have a little region to wander in , where they may pick and choose , and in which the images are so numerous that many are forgotten and found new in a second reading : which may be food for a week ’ s stroll in the summer ? Do they not like this better than what they can read through before Mrs. Williams comes down stairs ? a morning work at most ?”</p>
    <p n="7">The “ Polyolbion ” was completed by 1619 , though the concluding part was not published until 1623 . “ The Battaile of Agincourt ,” the poem now reprinted , appeared with others in 1627 . As none of the pieces comprised in it had appeared in the collected edition of Drayton ’ s works ( the “ Polyolbion ” excepted ) which he had published in 1620 , it is reasonable to conclude that they had been composed between that date and 1627 . They prove that his powers were by no means abated . “ Nimphidia ,” in particular , though lacking the exquisite sweetness of some of his lyric pastorals , and the deep emotion of passages in his “ Heroicall Epistles ,” excels all his other productions in airy fancy , and is perhaps the best known of any of his poems . Nor does the “ Battaile ” itself indicate any decay in poetical power , though we must agree with Mr. Bullen that it is in some parts fatiguing . This wearisomeness proceeds chiefly from Drayton ’ s over-faithful adherence , not so much to the actual story , as to the method of the chronicler from whom his materials are principally drawn . It does not seem to have occurred to him to regard his theme in the light of potter ’ s clay . Following his authority with servile deference , he makes at the beginning a slip which lowers the dignity of his hero , and consequently of his epic . He represents Henry the Fifth ’ s expedition against France as originally prompted , not by the restless enterprise and fiery valour of the young king , much less by supernatural inspiration as the working out of a divine purpose , but by the craft of the clergy seeking to divert him from too nice inquiry into the source and application of their revenues . Henry , therefore , without , as modern investigators think , even sufficient historical authority , but in any case without poetical justification , appears at the very beginning of the poem that celebrates his exploits in the light of a dupe . Shakespeare avoids this awkwardness by boldly altering the date of Henry ’ s embassy to France . His play opens , indeed , with the plots of the ecclesiastics to tempt the king into war , but it soon appears that the embassy claiming certain French dukedoms has been despatched before they had opened their lips , and that they are urging him to a course of action on which he is resolved already . Spenser or Dryden would have escaped from the difficulty in a manner more in accordance with epic precedent by representing Henry ’ s action as the effect of a divine vision . Edward the Third or the Black Prince would have risen from the grave to urge him to renew and complete their interrupted and now almost undone work ; or the ghosts of chiefs untimely slain would have reproached him with their abandoned conquests and neglected graves . Drayton has merely taken the story as he found it , without a thought of submitting its dross to the alchemy of the re-creative imagination of the poet . The same lack of selection is observable in his description of the battle itself . He minutely describes a series of episodes , in themselves often highly picturesque , but we are no better able to view the conflict as a whole than if we ourselves had fought in the ranks . As in painting , so in poetry , a true impression is not to be conveyed by microscopic accuracy in minutiæ , but by a vigorous grasp of the entire subject .</p>
    <p n="8">Notwithstanding these defects , which one might have thought would have been avoided even by a poet endowed with less of the bright and sprightly invention which Drayton manifests in so many of his pieces , “ The Battaile of Agincourt ” is a fine poem , and well deserving the honour of reprint . It is above all things patriotic , pervaded throughout by a manly and honourable preference for England and all things English , yet devoid of bitterness towards the enemy , whose valour is frankly acknowledged , and whose overweening pride , the cause of their disasters , is never made the object of ill-natured sarcasm . It may almost be said that if Drayton had been in some respects a worse man , he might on this occasion have been a better poet . He is so sedulously regardful of the truth of history , or what he takes to be such , that he neglects the poet ’ s prerogative of making history , and rises and falls with his model like a moored vessel pitching in a flowing tide . When his historical authority inspires , Drayton is inspired accordingly ; when it is dignified , so is he ; with it he soars and sings , with it he also sinks and creeps . Happily the subject is usually picturesque , and old Holinshed at his worst was no contemptible writer . Drayton ’ s heart too was in his work , as he had proved long before by the noble ballad on King Harry reprinted in this volume . If he has not shown himself an artist in the selection and arrangement of his topics , he deserves the name from another point of view by the excellent metrical structure of his octaves , and the easy fluency of his narrative . One annoying defect , the frequent occurrence of flat single lines not far remote from bathos , must be attributed to the low standard of the most refined poetry in an age when “ the judges and police of literature ” had hardly begun either to make laws or to enforce them . It is a fault which he shared with most others , and of which he has himself given more offensive instances . It is still more conspicuous in the most generally acceptable of his poems , the “ Nimphidia .” The pity is not so much the occasional occurrence of such lapses in “ The Battaile of Agincourt ,” as the want of those delightful touches in the other delightful poems which give more pleasure the more evidently they are embellishments rather springing out of the author ’ s fancy than naturally prompted by his subject . Such are the lines , as inappropriate in the mouth of the speaker as genuine from the heart of the writer , near the beginning of Queen Margaret ’ s epistle to the Duke of Suffolk (“ England ’ s Heroicall Epistles ”):</p>
    <p n="9">“ The little bird yet to salute the morn Upon the naked branches sets her foot , The leaves then lying on the mossy root , And there a silly chirruping doth keep , As if she fain would sing , yet fain would weep ; Praising fair summer that too soon is gone , Or sad for winter too soon coming on .”</p>
    <p n="10">On a more exact comparison of Drayton with Holinshed we find him omitting some circumstances which he might have been expected to have retained , and adding others with good judgment and in general with good effect , but which by some fatality usually tend in his hands to excessive prolixity . This is certainly not the case with his dignified and spirited exordium , but in the fourth stanza he begins to copy history , and his muse ’ s wing immediately flags . No more striking example of the superiority of dramatic to narrative poetry in vividness of delineation could be found than the contrast between Shakespeare ’ s scene representing the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Bishop of Ely in actual conversation , and Drayton ’ s tame exposition of the outcome of their deliberations . In his report of the session of Parliament where the French war is discussed he closely follows Holinshed , so closely as to omit Shakespeare ’ s masterly embellishment of Henry ’ s solemn appeal to the Archbishop to pronounce on the justice of his cause as in the sight of God . Drayton must assuredly have perceived how greatly such an appeal tended to exalt his hero ’ s character , and what an opening it afforded for impressive rhetoric . Nor could the incident have escaped his notice , for there is abundant internal evidence of his acquaintance with Shakespeare ’ s drama in the closet as well as on the stage . It can only be concluded that he did not choose to be indebted to Shakespeare , or despaired of rivalling him . His notice of his great contemporary in the “ Epistle to Reynolds ” is surprisingly cold ; but the legend , however unauthentic , of Shakespeare ’ s death from a fever contracted at a merry-making in Drayton ’ s company , seems incompatible with any serious estrangement , and Shakespeare ’ s son-in-law was Drayton ’ s physician when the latter revisited his native Warwickshire . The same jealousy of obligation must have influenced his treatment of the incident of the Dauphin ’ s derisive present of tennis balls , which both Shakespeare and he have adopted from Holinshed or his authorities , but of which the former has made everything and the latter nothing . Nor can the omission of the highly dramatic incident of the conspiracy of Scroop and Cambridge , found in Holinshed , be otherwise well accounted for . In compensation , Drayton introduces two episodes entirely his own , the catalogue of Henry ’ s ships , and that of the armorial ensigns of the British counties . Ben Jonson may be suspected of a sneer when he congratulates Drayton on thus outdoing Homer , as he had previously outdone , or at least rivalled , Virgil , Theocritus , Ovid , Orpheus , and Lucan . Ben might have said with perfect sincerity that Drayton ’ s descriptions are fine pieces of work , showing great command of language , and only open to criticism from some want of proportion between them and the poem of which they are but subordinate episodes . This censure would have been by no means just if the whole piece had been executed on the scale of the description of the siege of Harfleur . It is difficult to imagine what could have tempted Drayton to spend so much time upon an episode treated by Holinshed with comparative brevity . Some of the stanzas are exceedingly spirited , but as a whole the description certainly fatigues . If the same is to some extent the case with the description of the Battle of Agincourt itself , the cause is not so much prolixity as the multitude of separate episodes , not always derived from the chroniclers , and the consequent want of unity which has been already adverted to . The result is probably more true to the actual impression of a battle than if Drayton had surveyed the field with the eye of a tactician , but here as elsewhere the poet should rather aim at an exalted and in some measure idealized representation of the object or circumstance described than at a faithful reproduction of minor details . Even the Battle of the Frogs and Mice in Homer is an orderly whole ; while Drayton ’ s battle seems always ending and always beginning anew , a Sisyphian epic . What , however , really kindles and vivifies the unequal composition into one glowing mass is the noble spirit of enthusiastic patriotism which pervades the poet ’ s mind , and , like sunlight in a mountainous tract , illuminates his heights , veils his depressions , and steeps the whole in glory .</p>
    <p n="11">Of the literary history of “ The Battaile of Agincourt ” there is little to be said . It was first published in 1627 , along with “ Nimphidia ,” “ The Shepheard ’ s Sirena ,” and others of Drayton ’ s best pieces . It was accompanied by three copies of congratulatory verse , reprinted here , the most remarkable of which is that proceeding from the pen of Ben Jonson , who admits that some had accounted him no friend to Drayton , and whose encomiums are to our apprehension largely flavoured with irony . Drayton , in his “ Epistle to Reynolds ,” which Jonson must have seen , had compared him to Seneca and Plautus , [*] and Jonson seems to burlesque the compliment by comparing Drayton himself to every poet whom he had ever imitated , until his single person seems an epitome of all Parnassus . The poem and its companions had another edition in 1631 , since which time it has been included in every edition of Drayton ’ s works , but has never till now been published by itself . Even here it is graced with a satellite , the splendid Ballad of Agincourt (“ To my Frinds the Camber-Britans and theyr Harp ”) , originally published in “ Poemes lyric and pastoral ,” probably about 1605 . This stirring strain , always admired , has attracted additional notice in the present day as the metrical prototype of Tennyson ’ s “ Charge of the Light Brigade ,” which , in our estimation , fails to rival its model . The lapses of both poets may well be excused on the ground of the difficulty of the metre , but Drayton has the additional apology of the “ brave neglect ” which so correct a writer as Pope accounted a virtue in Homer , but which Tennyson never had the nerve to permit himself .</p>

    <p n="12">Comparisons between modern and ancient poets must necessarily be very imperfect ; yet our Drayton might not inaptly be termed the English Theocritus . If not so distinctly superior to every other English pastoral poet as Theocritus was to every other Greek , he yet stands in the front rank . He is utterly free from affectation , the great vice of pastoral poetry ; his love of the country is sincere ; his perception of natural phenomena exquisite ; his shepherds and shepherdesses real swains and lasses ; he has happily varied the conventional form of the pastoral by a felicitous lyrical treatment . Paradoxical as it may appear , Drayton was partly enabled to approach Theocritus so nearly by knowing him so imperfectly . Had he been acquainted with him otherwise than through Virgil , he would probably have been unable to refrain from direct imitation ; but as matters stand , instead of a poet striving to write as Theocritus wrote in Greek , we have one actually writing as Theocritus would have written in English . But the most remarkable point of contact between Drayton and Theocritus is that both are epical as well as pastoral poets . Two of the Idylls of Theocritus are believed to be fragments of an epic on the exploits of Hercules ; and in the enumeration of his lost works , amid others of the same description , mention is made of the “ Heroines ,” a curious counterpart of Drayton ’ s “ Heroicall Epistles .” Had these works survived , we might not improbably have found Drayton surpassing his prototype in epic as much as he falls below him in pastoral ; for the more exquisite art of the Sicilian could hardly have made amends for the lack of that national pride and enthusiastic patriotism which had died out of his age , but which ennobled the strength and upbore the weakness of the author of “ The Battaile of Agincourt .”</p>

    <p>TO MY FRINDS THE CAMBER-BRITANS AND THEYR HARP . Fayre stood the winde for France , When we our sailes aduance , Nor now to proue our chance Longer not tarry , But put vnto the mayne : At Kaux , the mouth of Seine , With all his warlike trayne Landed King Harry . And taking many a forte , Furnish ’ d in warlike sorte , Comming toward Agincourte ( In happy houre ) Skermishing day by day With those oppose his way , Whereas the Genrall laye With all his powre . Which in his height of pride , As Henry to deride , His ransome to prouide Vnto him sending ; Which he neglects the while , As from a nation vyle , Yet with an angry smile Their fall portending . And turning to his men , Quoth famous Henry then , Though they to one be ten , Be not amazed : Yet haue we well begun ; Battailes so brauely wonne Euermore to the sonne By fame are raysed . And for my selfe , ( quoth hee ) This my full rest shall bee , England nere mourne for me , Nor more esteeme me : Victor I will remaine , Or on this earth be slaine ; Neuer shall she sustaine Losse to redeeme me . Poiters and Cressy tell , When moste their pride did swell , Vnder our swords they fell : Ne lesse our skill is , Then when our grandsyre greate , Claiming the regall seate , In many a warlike feate Lop ’ d the French lillies . The Duke of Yorke soe dread The eager vaward led ; With the maine Henry sped Amongst his hench men . Excester had the rear , A brauer man not there . And now preparing were For the false Frenchmen And ready to be gone . Armour on armour shone , Drum vnto drum did grone , To hear was woonder ; That with the cries they make The very earth did shake : Trumpet to trumpet spake , Thunder to thunder . Well it thine age became , O , noble Erpingham ! That didst the signall frame Vnto the forces ; When from a medow by , Like a storme , sodainely The English archery Stuck the French horses . The Spanish vghe so strong , Arrowes a cloth-yard long , That like to serpents stoong , Piercing the wether : None from his death now starts , But playing manly parts , And like true English harts Stuck close together . When down theyr bowes they threw , And foorth theyr bilbowes drewe , And on the French they flew , No man was tardy . Arms from the shoulders sent , Scalpes to the teeth were rent ; Downe the French pesants went These were men hardye . When now that noble King , His broade sword brandishing , Into the hoast did fling , As to or ’ whelme it ; Who many a deep wound lent , His armes with blood besprent , And many a cruell dent Brused his helmett . Glo ’ ster that Duke so good , Next of the royall blood , For famous England stood With his braue brother : Clarence in steele most bright , That yet a maiden knighte , Yet in this furious fighte Scarce such an other . Warwick in bloode did wade , Oxford the foes inuade , And cruel slaughter made Still as they ran vp : Suffolk his axe did ply , Beaumont and Willoughby Bare them right doughtyly , Ferrers and Fanhope . On happy Cryspin day Fought was this noble fray , Which fame did not delay To England to carry . O ! when shall Englishmen With such acts fill a pen , Or England breed agen Such a King Harry ? ILLUSTRATIVE NOTES . ILLUSTRATIVE NOTES . Page 14 , l. 3 [ Stz . 4 ] . “ Monarchesse .” — This stately word ought to be revived ; it is fully as legitimate as abbess . Page 14 , l. 9 [ Stz . 5 ] . “ A Parliament is calld .” — It met at Leicester on April 30th , 1414 . Negotiations for a treaty with France had been opened on January 21st preceding . “ The first indication of a claim to the crown of France ,” says Sir Harris Nicolas (“ History of the Battle of Agincourt ”) , “ is a commission to the Bishop of Durham and others , dated on the 31st of May , 1414 , by which they were instructed to negotiate the restitution of such of their sovereign ’ s rights as were withheld by Charles .” Page 14 , l. 17 [ Stz . 6 ] . “ In which one Bill ( mongst many ) there was red .” —“ Many petitions moved ,” says Holinshed , “ were for that time deferred : amongst whyche one was that a bill exhibited in the Parliament holden at Westminstre in the eleventh year of King Henry the fourth , might now with good deliberation be pondered , and brought to some good conclusion . The effect of which supplication was that the temporall landes devoutely given , and disordinately spent by religious and other spirituall persons , should be seased into the Kyngs hands , sithence the same might suffice to maintayne to the honor of the King and defence of the realme fifteene Erles , fifteene C. Knightes , six M. two Esquiers , and a C. almes houses for reliefe only of the poor , impotente , and needie persones , and the King to have cleerely to his cofers twentie M. poundes .” Shakespeare (“ Henry V .,” act i ., sc . 1 ) versifies this passage with the remarkable deviation of making the surplus remaining to the Crown one thousand pounds instead of twenty thousand pounds . Page 14 , l. 23 . “ Which made those Church-men generally to feare .”— “ Cant . If it pass against us We lose the better half of our possession . Ely . This would drink deep . Cant . ’ Twould drink the cup and all .” Henry V ., act i ., sc . 1 . Though Henry did not touch the property of the English Church , he appropriated the revenues of one hundred and ten priories held by aliens , and made no restitution . Page 15 , l. 32 [ Stz . 11 ] . “ Thus frames his speech .” —“ There is no record of any speech made by Chicheley at this parliament ; we search for it in vain in the rolls of parliament , and in the history of the Privy Council .” — Dean Hook , who adds in a note , “ No notice would have been taken of what was meant by Hall for a display of his own rhetoric , if such splendid use of it had not been made by Shakespeare in the first scene of ‘ Henry V .’” Drayton ’ s version of the speech departs almost entirely from that given by the chroniclers , who make Chicheley , as no doubt he would have done , dwell at great length upon Henry ’ s alleged claim to the crown of France , and omit all topics unbefitting a man of peace . Drayton greatly curtails Chicheley ’ s legal arguments , and makes him talk like a warrior and a statesman . Shakespeare has shown his usual exquisite judgment by following Holinshed closely as regards the matter of Chicheley ’ s formal harangue , and relegating his exhortation to Henry to follow the example of the Black Prince to a separate discourse , marked off from the first by the king ’ s interruption . Drayton has also missed an opportunity in omitting Henry ’ s impressive appeal to the archbishop to advise him conscientiously in the matter , by which Shakespeare has set his hero ’ s character in the most favourable point of view from the very first . Page 17 , l. 9 [ Stz . 17 ] . “ Beame .” — Bohemia . Page 19 , ll . 13 , 14 [ Stz . 25 ] . “ And for they knew , the French did still abet The Scot against vs .” — The discussion between Westmorland and Exeter on the expediency of first attacking Scotland is found in Holinshed . In the rude old play , “ The Famous Victories of Henry the Fifth ,” on which Shakespeare founded his “ Henry IV .” and “ Henry V .,” the argument for attacking Scotland first is put into the mouth of the Archbishop of Canterbury . Shakespeare ’ s noble expansion of this scene from the hints of his artless predecessor and of the chroniclers is one of the most signal proofs of the superiority of his genius . Page 20 , l. 1 [ Stz . 28 ] . “ And instantly an Embassy is sent .” — Of the letters written by Henry on this occasion , Sir Harris Nicolas remarks in his standard work on the Battle of Agincourt , “ Their most striking features are falsehood , hypocrisy , and impiety .” Being so bad , they are naturally attributed by him to the much maligned Cardinal Beaufort . It is admitted that “ in some places they approach nearly to eloquence , and they are throughout clear , nervous , and impressive .” They are defended at great length by Mr. Tyler , in his “ Life of Henry V .” Page 20 , l. 20 [ Stz . 30 ] . “ A Tunne of Paris Tennis balls him sent .” — This incident , so famous from the use made of it by Shakespeare , is in all probability historical , being mentioned by Thomas Otterbourne , a contemporary writer , and in an inedited MS. chronicle of the same date . These are quoted by Sir Harris Nicolas and in Mr. Julian Marshall ’ s erudite “ Annals of Tennis ” ( London , 1878 ) . Its being omitted by other contemporaries is no strong argument against its authenticity . Drayton follows Shakespeare and the chronicler Hall in writing tunne . Holinshed uses the less poetical term barrel . Page 20 , ll . 28-32 [ Stz . 31 ] .— “ I ’ le send him Balls and Rackets if I liue That they such Racket shall in Paris see , When ouer lyne with Bandies I shall driue , As that before the Set be fully done , France may ( perhaps ) into the Hazard runne .” On these lines Mr. Julian Marshall observes : “ This passage is remarkable , as offering one of the first examples of the double sense of racket , meaning hubbub as well as the implement used in tennis ; and also as showing the early use of the word bandy , which we shall find recurring later in the history of the game .” None of the historians who have related the incident mention the pointed reply to the Dauphin put into Henry ’ s mouth by Shakespeare , that he would “ strike his father ’ s crown into the hazard .” The old playwright on whose foundation Shakespeare built merely says , “ Tel him that in stead of balles of leather we wil tosse him balles of brasse and yron .” Drayton must consequently have borrowed the term from Shakespeare , which is a pretty conclusive proof of his having read “ Henry V .” as well as witnessed its performance . Regarding Shakespeare ’ s justification for the technical terms used by him , Mr. Marshall judiciously remarks : “ It is certain that tennis was played and that rackets were used in the time of Henry V .; but whether chases were marked and a hazard invented , and to which of our hazards that hazard would answer , are questions which we cannot solve , and which doubtless never troubled ‘ sweet Will ’ for one single moment .” Sir Harris Nicolas prints in his appendix a ballad on the story of the tennis balls , “ obligingly communicated by Bertram Mitford , of Mitford Castle , in Northumberland , Esquire , who wrote it from the dictation of a very aged relative .” He also gives another version , from what source derived is not stated . The Roxburghe collection of ballads at the British Museum contains yet a third version , which , as it differs in many respects from the other two , is printed as an appendix to these Notes . Judging from the type , the date of the Museum broadside would appear to be about 1750 , and the piece itself can hardly be earlier than the eighteenth century . Page 21 , l. 18 [ Stz . 34 ] . “ Iacks .” — Machines for planing metal . Page 21 , l. 19 . “ An olde Fox .” — Sword , so called , it is said , from the figure of a fox anciently engraved upon the blade ; or , as Nares suggests , from the name of some celebrated cutler . “ Thou diest on point of fox ” ( Shakespeare , “ Henry V .,” act iv ., sc . 4 ) . Page 21 , l. 23 . “ Fletcher .” — An arrow-maker ( fléchier ) , with which trade the manufacture of bows , properly the business of the bowyer , was naturally combined . The frequency of the name in our own day might be alleged in proof of the ancient importance of the industry , but in most cases it is probably derived from flesher , a butcher . Page 22 , l. 1 [ Stz . 36 ] . “ The Light-horse and the Bard .” — A barded horse ( French bardelle , a pack-saddle ) is one with the body entirely covered with armour . “ For he was barded from counter to tail ” (“ Lay of the Last Minstrel ”) . Page 23 , l. 17 [ Stz . 42 ] . “ The scarlet Iudge might now set vp his Mule .” —“ Judges and serjeants rode to Westminster Hall on mules ; whence it is said of a young man studying the law , ‘ I see he was never born to ride upon a moyle ’ (‘ Every Man out of his Humour ,’ ii . 3 ) ; that is , he will never be eminent in his profession ” ( Nares ) . It is an odd example of the mutations of ordinary speech that if we now heard of a judge setting up a mule , we should understand the exact contrary of what was understood by Drayton . A modern writer would more probably have said , set down . Page 23 , l. 25 [ Stz . 43 ] . “ By this , the Counsell of this Warre had met .” — A curious echo of Spenser : “ By this the northern waggoner had set .” Page 24 , l. 16 [ Stz . 45 ] . “ Sleeue .” — Entirely obsolete in English , but France still knows the Channel as La Manche . Page 24 , l. 19 [ Stz . 46 ] . “ Scripts of Mart .” — Letters of marque . “ Mart , originally for Mars . It was probably this use of mart that led so many authors to use letters of mart , instead of marque , supposing it to mean letters of war . Under this persuasion Drayton put ‘ script of mart ’ as equivalent ” ( Nares ) . Page 24 , l. 22 . “ Deepe .” — Dieppe . Page 24 , l. 28 [ Stz . 47 ] . “ Like the huge Ruck from Gillingham that flewe .” — It seems remarkable to meet with the roc of the “ Arabian Nights ” in English so long before the existence of any translation . The word , however , occurs in Bishop Hall ’ s “ Satires ,” thirty years before Drayton . It probably came into our language from the Italian , being first used by Marco Polo , who says ( part iii ., chap . 35 ): “ To return to the griffon ; the people of the island do not know it by that name , but call it always ruc ; but we , from their extraordinary size , certainly conclude them to be griffons .” Page 25 , l. 2 [ Stz . 48 ] . “ Stoad .” — Not found in the dictionaries , but apparently equivalent to stowage , and hence in this place to cargo . Page 25 , ll . 5 , 6 . “ Straitly commanded by the Admirall , At the same Port to settle their aboad .” —“ On the 11th of April , 1415 , Nicholas Mauduyt , serjeant-at-arms , was commanded to arrest all ships and other vessels carrying twenty tons or more , as well belonging to this kingdom as to other countries , which were then in the river Thames , and in other sea-ports of the realm as far as Newcastle-upon-Tyne , or which might arrive there before the 1st of May , and the said vessels were to be at the ports of Southampton , London , or Winchelsea by the 8th of May at the latest ” ( Sir Harris Nicolas ) . Page 25 , l. 28 [ Stz . 51 ] . “ Bay of Portugall ” = Bay of Biscay . Page 26 , l. 14 [ Stz . 53 ] . “ Pruce .” — Prussia . Page 26 , l. 23 [ Stz . 54 ] . “ Flee-boats .” — Flyboats , Fr . flibots , which affords a more probable etymology than freebooter for flibustier and filibuster . Page 27 , ll . 17 , 18 [ Stz . 58 ] . “ From Holland , Zeland , and from Flanders wonne By weekely pay , threescore twelue Bottoms came .” —“ It was one of the earliest measures to secure shipping from Holland ” ( Nicolas ) . The total number of ships enumerated by Drayton as joining in the rendezvous at Southampton is one hundred and seventy-eight , the foreign hired vessels included . A contemporary authority quoted by Sir Harris Nicolas makes it three hundred and twenty , made up by contingents from the neighbouring havens to between twelve and fourteen hundred . According to the list published by Sir Harris Nicolas , the number of effective fighting men did not exceed ten thousand five hundred , though there were probably as many more attendants and camp-followers . Page 27 , l. 31 [ Stz . 59 ] . “ The acclamation of the presse .” — Might be said in our time of any popular war , but in how different a sense ! Page 28 , l. 1 [ Stz . 60 ] . — This and the following stanza are quoted by Sir Harris Nicolas with just admiration . In fact , Drayton ’ s description of the marshalling and departure of the expedition are the best part of his poem . Page 29 , ll . 4-6 [ Stz . 64 ] . “ In Ensignes there , Some wore the Armes of their most ancient Towne , Others againe their owne Diuises beare .” — The catalogue which follows is entirely in the spirit of Italian romantic poetry , and may be especially compared with that of Agramante ’ s allies and their insignia in the “ Orlando Innamorato .” In many instances the device , as Drayton says , represents the escutcheon of some town within the county ; in others he seems to have been indebted to his imagination , though endeavouring not unsuccessfully to adduce some reason for his choice . Page 30 , l. 11 [ Stz . 68 ] . “ Brack .” — Brine . Page 30 , l. 20 [ Stz . 69 ] . “ Lyam .” — A band or thong by which to lead a hound ; hence lyme-hound . Page 31 , l. 3 [ Stz . 71 ] . “ A Golden Fleece and Hereford doth weare .” — Grammar requires this line to begin And Hereford . Awkward dislocations , however , are not infrequent in Drayton . Page 31 , l. 6 . “ The Shiere whose surface seems most brute .” — George Eliot , like Drayton a native of fertile Warwickshire , entitles the neighbouring county Stonyshire . Page 33 , l. 17 [ Stz . 80 ] . “ The Fleet then full ,” etc . — Compare this fine stanza , which might have been written by one who had never been on shipboard , with the still more poetical and at the same time intensely realistic one of Shakespeare (“ Henry V .,” act iii ., prologue ) , which proves that he must have been at sea on some occasion : “ Play with your fancies , and in them behold Upon the hempen tackle ship-boys climbing ; Hear the shrill whistle which doth order give To sounds confused ; behold the threaden sails , Borne with the invisible and creeping wind , Draw the huge bottoms through the furrowed sea .” Page 34 , ll . 9 , 10 [ Stz . 83 ] . “ Long Boates with Scouts are put to land before , Vpon light Naggs the Countrey to discry .” —“ Before day-break the next morning , Wednesday the 14th of August , John Holland , Earl of Huntingdon , Sir Gilbert Umfreville , and Sir John Cornwall , were sent with a party of cavalry to reconnoitre Harfleur and its vicinity , with the view of selecting a proper situation for the encampment of the army ” ( Sir Harris Nicolas ) . Page 35 , l. 1 [ Stz . 86 ] . “ To the high ’ st earth whilst awfull Henry gets .” — Whilst must here be taken as = meanwhile . Page 35 , l. 3 . “ With sprightly words ” etc . — The confusion in this line is evidently due to the printer . Drayton must have written : “ And thus with sprightly words ,” etc . Page 35 , l. 9 [ Stz . 87 ] . “ He first of all proclaim ’ d .” —“ A proclamation was issued forbidding under pain of death a repetition of some excesses which had been committed , and commanding that henceforth the houses should not be set on fire , or the churches or other sacred places violated , and that the persons of women and priests should be held sacred ” ( Sir Harris Nicolas ) . Holinshed adds , “ or to any suche as should be founde withoute weapon or armor , and not ready to make resistance .” Page 36 , l. 30 [ Stz . 93 ] . “ Shee so instructed is by Natures Lawes .” — A characteristic instance of this excellent poet ’ s frequent and unaccountable lapses into bathos . Page 38 , l. 7 [ Stz . 98 ] . “ Whose Mynes to the besieg ’ d more mischiefe doe .” — Holinshed , however , admits that the French “ with their countermining somewhat disappointed the Englishmen , and came to fight with them hand to hand within the mynes , so that they went no further forward with that worke .” Page 41 , l. 30 [ Stz . 113 ] . “ But on his bare feete to the Church he came .” —“ He dismounted at the gate , took off his shoes and stockings , and proceeded barefoot to the church of St. Martin , where he gave solemn thanks to God for his success ” ( Sir Harris Nicolas , quoting the French chroniclers ) , Holinshed mentions Henry ’ s repairing to the church to offer thanks , but omits the picturesque circumstance of his going thither barefoot , and passes over his entrance into the town in the briefest possible manner . It is an interesting proof of Shakespeare ’ s dependence upon the chronicler to find him equally ignoring any solemn entry or prolonged sojourn : “ To-night in Harfleur will we be your guest , To-morrow for the march are we addrest .” In fact , as Drayton tells us , he remained eight days in Harfleur , awaiting the Dauphin ’ s reply to his challenge , which Holinshed does not mention . Shakespeare , Drayton , and Holinshed alike pass over the exceedingly picturesque circumstance of the expulsion of the women and children under escort of the English troops . Drayton only says : “ Out of the Ports all Vagrants he doth driue .” Page 42 , ll . 7 , 8 [ Stz . 114 ] . “ He frankly off ’ reth in a single fight , With the young Daulphine to decide his right .” — Sir Harris Nicolas remarks : “ Of the personal valour which that letter displays on the part of Henry but little can be said , for the challenger was about twenty-seven years of age , and in the full vigour of manhood , whilst his adversary , of whose prowess or bodily strength there is not the slightest evidence , and who died in the December following , had not attained his twentieth year .” Page 43 , ll . 15 , 16 [ Stz . 119 ] . “ A Ford was found to set his Army ore Which neuer had discouered beene before .” — This cannot be , for the anonymous priest to whose narrative as an eyewitness of the campaign we are so deeply indebted , says , “ The approach was by two long but narrow causeways , which the French had before warily broken through the middle ” ( Nicolas , p. 233 ) . Page 44 , l. 1 [ Stz . 122 ] . “ Therfore they both in solemne Counsaile satt .” — This council was held on October 20th , five days before Agincourt . “ The opinions of the different members ,” says Sir Harris Nicolas , “ are very minutely given by Des Ursins .” Page 44 , l. 2 . “ Britaine .” — Brittany . The Duke of Brittany , in fact , did not arrive in time to take part in the battle . Page 44 , l. 17 [ Stz . 124 ] . “ A Route of tatter ’ d Rascalls starued so .” — Holinshed ’ s description of the condition of the English army is most graphic : “ The English men were brought into great misery in this journey , their victuall was in maner spent , and nowe coulde they get none : for their enemies had destroied all the corne before they came : reste could they none take , for their enemies were ever at hande to give them alarmes : dayly it rained , and nightly it freesed : of fewell there was great scarsitie , but of fluxes greate plenty : money they hadde enoughe , but of wares to bestowe it uppon for their reliefe or comforte , hadde they little or none . And yet in this great necessitye the poore people of the countrey were not spoiled , nor any thyng taken of them wythout payment , neyther was any outrage or offence done by the Englishemenne of warre , except one , whiche was , that a folish souldiour stale a pixe out of a churche .” Shakespeare ’ s use of this incident is well known . Page 46 , l. 28 [ Stz . 133 ] . “ Spirits .” — Must here be pronounced as a monosyllable , as at p. 67 , l. 18 . Page 48 , l. 6 [ Stz . 138 ] . “ Till their foule noyse doth all the ayre infest .” — Drayton probably stands alone among English poets in disliking the music of the rookery . Page 49 , l. 15 [ Stz . 143 ] . “ Quoyts , Lots , and Dice for Englishmen to cast .” —“ The captaines had determined before howe to devide the spoile , and the souldiours the night before had plaid the englishemen at dice ” ( Holinshed ) . Page 50 , l. 9 [ Stz . 147 ] . “ And cast to make a Chariot for the King .” — This circumstance also is mentioned by Holinshed , and is authenticated by the anonymous priest . Page 50 , ll . 31 , 32 [ Stz . 149 ] . “ Some pointing Stakes to stick into the ground , To guard the Bow-men .” — Henry had ordered the archers to provide themselves with stakes even before the passage of the Somme . Page 51 , l. 25 [ Stz . 153 ] . “ King Richards wrongs , to minde , Lord doe not call .” — Drayton evidently follows Shakespeare , but remains a long way behind : “ Not to-day , O Lord , O , not to-day , think not upon the fault My father made in compassing the crown ! I Richard ’ s body have interred new : And on it have bestowed more contrite tears Than from it issued forced drops of blood : Five hundred poor I have in yearly pay , Who twice a day their withered hands hold up Toward heaven , to pardon blood ; and I have built Two chantries , where the sad and solemn priests Sing still for Richard ’ s soul . More will I do ; Though all that I can do is nothing worth , Since that my penitence comes after all , Imploring pardon .” Henry V ., act iv ., sc . 1 . Shakespeare ’ s infinite superiority in moral delicacy , not merely to his imitator , but to all poets except the very best , is forcibly shown by his causing Henry to abstain from all attempts to excuse his father and himself at the expense of Richard , so natural in the mouth of an ordinary person , so unbecoming a hero . Page 52 , ll . 6 , 7 [ Stz . 154 ] . “ When as that Angell to whom God assign ’ d The guiding of the English .” — This fine passage may very probably have been in Dryden ’ s mind when he planned the machinery of his unwritten epic , and in Addison ’ s when he penned the famous simile of the Angel in his poem on Blenheim . Page 52 , ll . 29 , 30 [ Stz . 157 ] . “ Foorth that braue King couragious Henry goes , An hower before that it was fully light .” — No personal reconnoissance on Henry ’ s part is mentioned by the historians , although Sir Harris Nicolas says , on the authority of Elmham : “ About the middle of the night , before the moon set , Henry sent persons to examine the ground , by whose report he was better able to draw up his forces on the next day .” As the English were the assailants , the precaution of posting the archers behind the quickset hedge would have proved unnecessary . Page 55 , l. 27 [ Stz . 169 ] . “ His coruetting Courser .” —“ A little grey horse .” He wore no spurs , probably to show his men that he entertained no thought of flight . Page 56 , l. 20 [ Stz . 172 ] . “ To know what he would for his Ransome pay .” — This is mentioned by Holinshed , but cannot be true , for all contemporary authorities agree that the French sent envoys to Henry on the morning of the battle offering him a free passage to Calais upon condition of surrendering Harfleur . This would seem to indicate that the leaders did not fully share the confidence of their troops . Page 57 , ll . 3 , 4 [ Stz . 174 ] . “ And strongly fixe the Diadem of France , Which to this day vnsteady doth remaine .” — No Frenchman could have said this on such an occasion . Drayton would make for any port when in stress of rhyme . Page 57 , l. 16 [ Stz . 175 ] . “ Thus to his Souldiers comfortably spake .” — Drayton ’ s version of his speech in the main agrees with Holinshed ’ s . Shakespeare , usually so close a follower of Holinshed , substitutes an oration entirely of his own composition . The beautiful lines — “ For he this day that sheds his blood with me Shall be my brother ; be he ne ’ er so vile This day shall gentle his condition ”— appear to be derived from the same source as the exaggerated statement of Archbishop Des Ursins , that on another occasion Henry promised that his plebeian soldiers should be ennobled and invested with collars of SS . This cannot be taken directly from Des Ursins , whose history of the reign of Charles VI ., though written in the fifteenth century , was not published until 1614 . Page 58 , ll . 9 , 10 [ Stz . 179 ] . “ When hearing one wish all the valiant men At home in England , with them present were .” — According to the anonymous monk , who may be fully relied upon , the speaker was Sir Walter Hungerford . Shakespeare puts the sentiment into the mouth of the Earl of Westmorland . Page 59 , l. 9 [ Stz . 183 ] . “ At the full Moone looke how th ’ vnweldy Tide ” etc . — These lines are clearly a reminiscence of Shakespeare ’ s — “ Let the brow o ’ erwhelm it As fearfully as doth a galled rock O ’ erhang and jutty his confounded base , Swill ’ d with the wild and wasteful ocean .” Henry V ., prologue to act iii . Page 62 , l. 21 [ Stz . 196 ] . “ Dampeir .” — Chatillon , Admiral of France , was also Lord of Dampierre . It must be by inadvertence that Sir Harris Nicolas ( p. 121 ) speaks of Cliquet de Brabant , whom Drayton calls Cluet , as Admiral . Page 63 , l. 6 [ Stz . 198 ] . “ Could .” — Must have been pronounced cold , as it was sometimes written . See also p. 83 , l. 26 . Page 63 , l. 16 [ Stz . 199 ] . “ Cantels .” — Corners ( Germ . Kant ) ; hence = morsels , though Shakespeare speaks of “ a monstrous cantle .” Page 66 , ll . 11 , 12 [ Stz . 211 ] . “ Bespeaking them with honourable words Themselues their prisoners freely and confesse .” — One of Drayton ’ s awkward inversions . The anonymous ecclesiastic says that some of the French nobles surrendered themselves more than ten times , and were slain after all . Page 72 , l. 15 [ Stz . 235 ] . “ In comes the King his Brothers life to saue .” —“ The Duke of Gloucester , the King ’ s brother , was sore wounded about the hippes , and borne down to the ground , so that he fel backwards , with his feete towards his enemies , whom the King bestridde , and like a brother valiantly rescued him from his enimies , and so saving his life , caused him to be conveyed out of the fight into a place of more safetie ” ( Holinshed ) . Page 72 , ll . 25 , 26 [ Stz . 237 ] . “ Vpon the King Alanzon prest so sore , That with a stroke ,” etc . — There seems no contemporary authority for the single combat between Henry and Alençon of which Shakespeare has made such ingenious use in his management of the incident of Henry ’ s glove . According to one account , Alençon struck at the King somewhat unfairly as he was stooping to aid his brother , and smote off a piece of his crown . According to another authority , the blow was given by one of a band of eighteen knights who had sworn to strike the diadem from Henry ’ s head , or perish in the attempt , as they all did . Page 82 , l. 28 [ Stz . 277 ] . “ Nock .” — Notch . Page 83 , l. 16 [ Stz . 279 ] . “ Tue .” — Must be pronounced as a dissyllable ; but the French cry was more probably tuez . Page 85 , l. 28 [ Stz . 289 ] . “ Base .” — Run as at prisoners ’ base . Murray ’ s “ Dictionary ” cites one example of the use of the word in this sense , which is from Warner ’ s “ Albion ’ s England ,” a poem read and admired by Drayton . Page 87 , l. 27 [ Stz . 297 ] . “ Clunasse .” — A misprint for Clamasse . Page 87 , l. 27 . “ Dorpe ” = thorpe , a word revived by Tennyson in “ The Brook .” Page 88 , ll . 17 , 18 [ Stz . 300 ] . “ And in his rage he instantly commands , That euery English should his prisoner kill .”— “ I was not angry since I came to France Until this instant .” Henry V ., act iv ., sc . 7 . Page 92 , l. 15 [ Stz . 315 ] . “ And so tow ’ rds Callice brauely marching on .” — This is certainly a flat conclusion . It is surprising that Drayton made no use of the appearance of the herald Montjoy on the field , with confession of defeat and appeal for — “ Charitable licence , That we may wander o ’ er this bloody field To book our dead , and then to bury them .” Henry V ., act iv ., sc . 7 . TO MY FRINDS THE CAMBER-BRITANS AND THEYR HARP . It has already been observed in the Introduction that this grand lyric gave the model for Tennyson ’ s “ Charge of the Light Brigade .” This latter poem appears along with “ Maud ,” and another piece in the same slender volume contains unequivocal proof of the Laureate ’ s acquaintance with Drayton . In the powerful poem entitled “ Will ” occur the lines — “ Sown in a wrinkle of the monstrous hill , The city sparkles like a grain of salt .” In a passage of Song IX . of the “ Polyolbion ,” excerpted by Mr. Bullen , Drayton says — “ The mightie Giant-heape so less and lesser still Appeareth to the eye , untill the monstrous hill At length shewes like a cloud ; and further being cast , Is out of kenning quite .” The identity of epithet might possibly be accidental , but the resemblance extends to the entire passage . A singularly beautiful stanza from Drayton ’ s “ Barons ’ Warres ,” also in Mr. Bullen ’ s selection , must have been unconsciously present to Shelley ’ s mind when he wrote in “ The Witch of Atlas ”— “ While on her hearth lay blazing many a piece Of sandal wood , rare gems , and cinnamon . Men scarcely know how beautiful fire is ; Each flame of it is as a precious stone Dissolved in ever-moving light , and this Belongs to each and all who gaze thereon .” Drayton writes : “ The Fire of precious Wood , the Light Perfume Which left a sweetnesse on each thing it shone , As every thing did to it selfe assume The Sent from them and made the same their owne So that the painted Flowres within the Roome Were sweet , as if they naturally had growne ; The Light gave Colours , which upon them fell , And to the Colours the Perfume gave smell .” A still stronger proof of the extent to which Shelley had unconsciously imbibed the spirit of Drayton is afforded by a comparison of the noble speech of Fame in “ The tragicall legend of Robert Duke of Normandie ” ( Bullen , pp . 25 , 27 ) with Shelley ’ s still finer “ Hymn of Apollo .” There is hardly any instance of direct verbal resemblance ; but the metre , the strain of sentiment , the oratorical pose , the mental and moral attitude of the two poems are so much alike as to justify the assertion that the younger owes its form and much of its spirit to the older . The following is the Roxburghe version of the ballad of the Dauphin ’ s present of tennis-balls , mentioned at p. 106 :— KING HENRY V. HIS CONQUEST OF FRANCE , In Revenge for the Affront Offered by the French King ; In Sending Him ( Instead of the Tribute ) A Ton of Tennis-Balls . As our King lay musing on his bed , He bethought himself upon a time , Of a tribute that was due from France , Had not been paid for so long a time . Fal , lal , etc . He called for his lovely page , His lovely page then called he ; Saying , You must go to the King of France , To the King of France , sir , ride speedily . O then went away this lovely page , This lovely page then away went he ; Low he came to the King of France , And then fell down on his bended knee . My master greets you , worthy sir , Ten ton of Gold that is due to he , That you will send his tribute home , Or in French land you soon him will see . Fal , lal , etc . Your master ’ s young and of tender years , Not fit to come into my degree , And I will send him three Tennis-Balls That with them he may learn to play . O then returned this lovely page , This lovely page then returned he , And when he came to our gracious King , Low he fell down on his bended knee . [ A line cut off . ] What is the news you have brought to me ? I have brought such news from the King of France That he and you will ne ’ er agree . He says , You ’ re young and of tender years , Not fit to come to his degree ; And he will send you three Tennis-Balls That with them you may learn to play . Recruit me Cheshire and Lancashire , And Derby Hills that are so free ; No marry ’ d man , or widow ’ s son , For no widow ’ s curse shall go with me . They recruited Cheshire and Lancashire , And Derby Hills that are so free ; No marry ’ d man , nor no widow ’ s son , Yet there was a jovial bold company . O then we march ’ d into the French land With drums and trumpets so merrily ; And then bespoke the King of France , Lo yonder comes proud King Henry . The first shot that the Frenchmen gave They kill ’ d our Englishmen so free , We kill ’ d ten thousand of the French , And the rest of them they run away . And then we marched to Paris gates , With drums and trumpets so merrily , O then bespoke the King of France , The Lord have mercy on my men and me . O I will send him his tribute home , Ten ton of Gold that is due to he , And the finest flower that is in all France , To the Rose of England I will give free . CHISWICK PRESS :— C.
