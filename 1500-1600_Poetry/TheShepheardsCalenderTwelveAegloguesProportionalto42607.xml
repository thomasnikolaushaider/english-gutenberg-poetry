   <p>TO THE MOST EXCELLENT AND LEARNED BOTH ORATOR AND POET , MAISTER GABRIEL HARVEY ,</p>
   <p>His very special and singular good friend E. K. commendeth the good liking of this his good labour , and the patronage of the new Poet .</p>
   <p>Uncouth , unkiss 'd , said the old famous poet Chaucer : whom for his excellency and wonderful skill in making , his scholar Lidgate , a worthy scholar of so excellent a maister , calleth the loadstar of our language : and whom our Colin Clout in his Æglogue , calleth Tityrus the god of shepheards , comparing him to the worthiness of the Roman Tityrus , Virgil . Which proverb , mine own good friend M. Harvey , as in that good old poet it served well Pandar 's purpose for the bolstering of his bawdy brocage , so very well taketh place in this our new Poet , who for that he is uncouth ( as said Chaucer ) is unkiss 'd , and unknown to most men , is regarded but of a few . But I doubt not , so soon as his name shall come into the knowledge of men , and his worthiness be sounded in the trump of Fame , but that he shall be not only kiss 'd , but also beloved of all , embraced of the most , and wonder 'd at of the best . No less , I think , deserveth his wittiness in devising , his pithiness in uttering , his complaints of love so lovely , his discourses of pleasure so pleasantly , his pastoral rudeness , his moral wiseness , his due observing of decorum every where , in personages , in seasons , in matter , in speech ; and generally , in all seemly simplicity of handling his matters , and framing his words : the which of many things which in him be strange , I know will seem the strangest , and words themselves being so ancient , the knitting of them so short and intricate , and the whole period and compass of speech so delightsome for the roundness , and so grave for the strangeness . And first of the words to speak , I grant they be something hard , and of most men unused , yet both English , and also used of most excellent authors , and most famous poets . In whom , when as this our Poet hath been much travailed and throughly read , how could it be , ( as that worthy orator said ) but that walking in the sun , although for other cause he walked , yet needs he must be sunburnt ; and , having the sound of those ancient poets still ringing in his ears , he must needs , in singing , hit out some of their tunes . But whether he useth them by such casualty and custom , or of set purpose and choice , as thinking them fittest for such rustical rudeness of shepheards , either for that their rough sound would make his rhymes more ragged and rustical ; or else because such old and obsolete words are most used of country folk , sure I think , and think I think not amiss , that they bring great grace , and , as one would say , authority to the verse . For albe , amongst many other faults , it specially be objected of Valla against Livy , and of other against Sallust , that with over much study they affect antiquity , as covering thereby credence and honour of elder years ; yet I am of opinion , and eke the best learned are of the like , that those ancient solemn words are a great ornament , both in the one , and in the other : the one labouring to set forth in his work an eternal image of antiquity , and the other carefully discoursing matters of gravity and importance . For , if my memory fail not , Tully in that book , wherein he endeavoureth to set forth the pattern of a perfect orator , saith that ofttimes an ancient word maketh the style seem grave , and as it were reverend , no otherwise than we honour and reverence gray hairs for a certain religious regard , which we have of old age . Yet neither every where must old words be stuffed in , nor the common dialect and manner of speaking so corrupted thereby , that , as in old buildings , it seem disorderly and ruinous . But all as in most exquisite pictures they use to blaze and pourtray not only the dainty lineaments of beauty , but also round about it to shadow the rude thickets and craggy clifts , that , by the baseness of such parts , more excellency may accrue to the principal : for oftentimes we find ourselves , I know not how , singularly delighted with the shew of such natural rudeness , and take great pleasure in that disorderly order . Even so do those rough and harsh terms enlumine , and make more clearly to appear , the brightness of brave and glorious words . So oftentimes a discord in music maketh a comely concordance : so great delight took the worthy poet Alceus to behold a blemish in the joint of a well-shaped body . But , if any will rashly blame such his purpose in choice of old and unwonted words , him may I more justly blame and condemn , or of witless headiness in judging , or of heedless hardiness in condemning : for , not marking the compass of his bent , he will judge of the length of his cast : for in my opinion it is one especial praise of many , which are due to this Poet , that he hath laboured to restore , as to their rightful heritage , such good and natural English words , as have been long time out of use , and almost clean disherited . Which is the only cause , that our mother tongue , which truly of itself is both full enough for prose , and stately enough for verse , hath long time been counted most bare and barren of both . Which default when as some endeavoured to salve and recure , they patched up the holes with pieces and rags of other languages , borrowing here of the French , there of the Italian , every where of the Latin ; not weighing how ill those tongues accord with themselves , but much worse with ours : So now they have made our English tongue a gallimaufrey , or hodgepodge of all other speeches . Other some not so well seen in the English tongue , as perhaps in other languages , if they happen to hear an old word , albeit very natural and significant , cry out straightway , that we speak no English , but gibberish , or rather such as in old time Evander 's mother spake : whose first shame is , that they are not ashamed , in their own mother tongue , to be counted strangers and aliens . The second shame no less than the first , that what so they understand not , they straightway deem to be senseless , and not at all to be understood . Much like to the mole in Æsop 's fable , that , being blind herself , would in no wise be persuaded that any beast could see . The last , more shameful than both , that of their own country and natural speech , which together with their nurse 's milk they sucked , they have so base regard and bastard judgment , that they will not only themselves not labour to garnish and beautify it , but also repine , that of other it should be embellished . Like to the dog in the manger , that himself can eat no hay , and yet barketh at the hungry bullock , that so fain would feed : whose currish kind , though it cannot be kept from barking , yet I conne them thank that they refrain from biting .</p>
   <p>Now , for the knitting of sentences , which they call the joints and members thereof , and for all the compass of the speech , it is round without roughness , and learned without hardness , such indeed as may be perceived of the least , understood of the most , but judged only of the learned . For what in most English writers useth to be loose , and as it were unright , in this Author is well grounded , finely framed , and strongly trussed up together . In regard whereof , I scorn and spue out the rakehelly rout of our ragged rhymers ( for so themselves use to hunt the letter ) which without learning boast , without judgment jangle , without reason rage and foam , as if some instinct of poetical spirit had newly ravished them above the meanness of common capacity . And being , in the midst of all their bravery , suddenly , either for want of matter , or rhyme ; or having forgotten their former conceit ; they seem to be so pained and travailed in their remembrance , as it were a woman in childbirth , or as that same Pythia , when the trance came upon her . “ Os rabidum fera corda domans , ” etc .</p>
   <p>Nathless , let them a God 's name feed on their own folly , so they seek not to darken the beams of others ’ glory . As for Colin , under whose person the Author 's self is shadowed , how far he is from such vaunted titles and glorious shews , both himself sheweth , where he saith :</p>
   <p>“ Of Muses , Hobbin , I conne no skill . ”</p>
   <p>And ,</p>
   <p>“ Enough is me to paint out my unrest , ” etc .</p>
   <p>And also appeareth by the baseness of the name , wherein it seemeth he chose rather to unfold great matter of argument covertly than , professing it , not suffice thereto accordingly . Which moved him rather in Æglogues than otherwise to write , doubting perhaps his ability , which he little needed , or minding to furnish our tongue with this kind , wherein it faulteth ; or following the example of the best and most ancient poets , which devised this kind of writing , being both so base for the matter , and homely for the manner , at the first to try their abilities ; and as young birds , that be newly crept out of the nest , by little first prove their tender wings , before they make a greater flight . So flew Theocritus , as you may perceive he was already full fledged . So flew Virgil , as not yet well feeling his wings . So flew Mantuane , as not being full somm 'd . So Petrarch . So Boccace . So Marot , Sanazarius , and also divers other excellent both Italian and French poets , whose footing this author every where followeth : yet so as few , but they be well scented , can trace him out . So finally flieth this our new Poet as a bird whose principals be scarce grown out , but yet as one that in time shall be able to keep wing with the best . Now , as touching the general drift and purpose of his Æglogues , I mind not to say much , himself labouring to conceal it . Only this appeareth , that his unstayed youth had long wander 'd in the common labyrinth of love , in which time to mitigate and allay the heat of his passion , or else to warn ( as he saith ) the young shepheards , his equals and companions , of his unfortunate folly , he compiled these twelve Æglogues , which , for that they be proportioned to the state of the twelve monethes , he termeth it the Shepheard 's Calender , applying an old name to a new work . Hereunto have I added a certain gloss , or scholion , for the exposition of old words and harder phrases ; which manner of glossing and commenting , well I wot , will seem strange and rare in our tongue : yet , for so much as I knew many excellent and proper devices , both in words and matter , would pass in the speedy course of reading either as unknown , or as not marked ; and that in this kind , as in other , we might be equal to the learned of other nations ; I thought good to take the pains upon me , the rather for that by means of some familiar acquaintance I was made privy to his counsel and secret meaning in them , as also in sundry other works of his . Which albeit I know he nothing so much hateth , as to promulgate , yet thus much have I adventured upon his friendship , himself being for long time far estranged ; hoping that this will the rather occasion him to put forth divers other excellent works of his , which sleep in silence ; as his Dreams , his Legends , his Court of Cupid , and sundry others , whose commendation to set out were very vain , the things though worthy of many , yet being known to few . These my present pains , if to any they be pleasurable or profitable , be you judge , mine own Maister Harvey , to whom I have both in respect of your worthiness generally , and otherwise upon some particular and special considerations , vowed this my labour , and the maidenhead of this our common friend 's poetry ; himself having already in the beginning dedicated it to the noble and worthy gentleman , the right worshipful Maister Philip Sidney , a special favourer and maintainer of all kind of learning . Whose cause , I pray you , sir , if envy shall stir up any wrongful accusation , defend with your mighty rhetoric and other your rathe gifts of learning , as you can , and shield with your good will , as you ought , against the malice and outrage of so many enemies , as I know will be set on fire with the sparks of his kindled glory . And thus recommending the Author unto you , as unto his most special good friend , and myself unto you both , as one making singular account of two so very good and so choice friends , I bid you both most heartily farewell , and commit you and your commendable studies to the tuition of the Greatest .</p>
   <p>Your own assuredly to be commanded , E. K.<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span></p>
   <p>P. S .— Now I trust , M. Harvey , that upon sight of your special friend 's and fellow poet 's doings , or else for envy of so many unworthy Quidams , which catch at the garland which to you alone is due , you will be persuaded to pluck out of the hateful darkness those so many excellent English poems of yours which lie hid , and bring them forth to eternal light . Trust me , you do both them great wrong , in depriving them of the desired sun ; and also yourself , in smothering your deserved praises ; and all men generally , in withholding from them so divine pleasures , which they might conceive of your gallant English verses , as they have already done of your Latin poems , which , in my opinion , both for invention and elocution are very delicate and super-excellent . And thus again I take my leave of my good M. Harvey . From my lodging at London this tenth of April 1579 .</p>
   <p>THE GENERAL ARGUMENT OF THE WHOLE BOOK .</p>
   <p>Little , I hope , needeth me at large to discourse the first original of Æglogues , having already touched the same . But , for the word Æglogues I know is unknown to most , and also mistaken of some of the best learned , ( as they think ,) I will say somewhat thereof , being not at all impertinent to my present purpose .</p>
   <p>They were first of the Greeks , the inventors of them , called Aeglogai , as it were Aegon , or Aeginomon logi , that is , Goatherds ’ tales . For although in Virgil and others the speakers be more shepheards than goatherds , yet Theocritus , in whom is more ground of authority than in Virgil , this specially from that deriving , as from the first head and wellspring , the whole invention of these Æglogues maketh goatherds the persons and authors of his tales . This being , who seeth not the grossness of such as by colour of learning would make us believe , that they are more rightly termed Eclogai , as they would say , extraordinary discourses of unnecessary matter : which definition albe in substance and meaning it agree with the nature of the thing , yet no whit answereth with the analysis and interpretation of the word . For they be not termed Eclogues , but Æglogues ; which sentence this Author very well observing , upon good judgment , though indeed few goatherds have to do herein , nevertheless doubteth not to call them by the used and best known name . Other curious discourses hereof I reserve to greater occasion .</p>
   <p>These twelve Æglogues , every where answering to the seasons of the twelve monethes , may be well divided into three forms or ranks . For either they be plaintive , as the first , the sixth , the eleventh , and the twelfth ; or recreative , such as all those be , which contain matter of love , or commendation of special personages ; or moral , which for the most part be mixed with some satyrical bitterness ; namely , the second , of reverence due to old age ; the fifth , of coloured deceit ; the seventh and ninth , of dissolute shepheards and pastors ; the tenth , of contempt of Poetry and pleasant Wits . And to this division may every thing herein be reasonably applied ; a few only except , whose special purpose and meaning I am not privy to . And thus much generally of these twelve Æglogues . Now will we speak particularly of all , and first of the first , which he calleth by the first moneth 's name , Januarie : wherein to some he may seem foully to have faulted , in that he erroneously beginneth with that moneth , which beginneth not the year . For it is well known , and stoutly maintained with strong reasons of the learned , that the year beginneth in March ; for then the sun reneweth his finished course , and the seasonable spring refresheth the earth , and the pleasance thereof , being buried in the sadness of the dead winter now worn away , reliveth .</p>
   <p>This opinion maintain the old Astrologers and Philosophers , namely , the reverend Andalo , and Macrobius in his Holy Days of Saturn ; which account also was generally observed both of Grecians and Romans . But , saving the leave of such learned heads , we maintain a custom of counting the seasons from the moneth Januarie , upon a more special cause than the heathen Philosophers ever could conceive , that is , for the Incarnation of our mighty Saviour , and Eternal Redeemer the Lord Christ , who as then renewing the state of the decayed world , and returning the compass of expired years to their former date and first commencement , left to us his heirs a memorial of his birth in the end of the last year and beginning of the next . Which reckoning , beside that eternal monument of our salvation , leaneth also upon good proof of special judgment .</p>
   <p>For albeit that in elder times , when as yet the count of the year was not perfected , as afterward it was by Julius Cæsar , they began to tell the monethes from March 's beginning , and according to the same , God ( as is said in Scripture ) commanded the people of the Jews , to count the moneth Abib , that which we call March , for the first moneth , in remembrance that in that moneth he brought them out of the land of Egypt : yet , according to tradition of latter times it hath been otherwise observed , both in government of the Church and rule of mightiest realms . For from Julius Cæsar who first observed the leap year , which he called Bissextilem Annum , and brought into a more certain course the odd wand'ring days which of the Greeks were called Hyperbainontes , of the Romans Intercalares , ( for in such matter of learning I am forced to use the terms of the learned ,) the monethes have been numbered twelve , which in the first ordinance of Romulus were but ten , counting but 304 days in every year , and beginning with March . But Numa Pompilius , who was the father of all the Roman ceremonies and religion , seeing that reckoning to agree neither with the course of the sun nor the moon , thereunto added two monethes , Januarie and Februarie ; wherein it seemeth , that wise king minded upon good reason to begin the year at Januarie , of him therefore so called tanquam janua anni , the gate and entrance of the year ; or of the name of the god Janus , to which god for that the old Paynims attributed the birth and beginning of all creatures new coming into the world , it seemeth that he therefore to him assigned the beginning and first entrance of the year . Which account for the most part hath hitherto continued : notwithstanding that the Egyptians begin their year at September ; for that , according to the opinion of the best Rabbins and very purpose of the Scripture itself , God made the world in that moneth , that is called of them Tisri . And therefore he commanded them to keep the feast of Pavilions in the end of the year , in the xv . day of the seventh moneth , which before that time was the first .</p>
   <p>But our author , respecting neither the subtilty of the one part , nor the antiquity of the other , thinketh it fittest , according to the simplicity of common understanding , to begin with Januarie ; weening it perhaps no decorum that shepheards should be seen in matter of so deep insight , or canvass a case of so doubtful judgment . So therefore beginneth he , and so continueth he throughout .</p>

   <p>JANUARIE . ÆGLOGA PRIMA . ARGUMENT .</p>
   <p>In this first Æglogue Colin Clout , a shepheard 's boy , complaineth himself of his unfortunate love , being but newly ( as seemeth ) enamoured of a country lass called Rosalind : with which strong affection being very sore travailed , he compareth his careful case to the sad season of the year , to the frosty ground , to the frozen trees , and to his own winter-beaten flock . And lastly , finding himself robbed of all former pleasance and delight , he breaketh his pipe in pieces , and casteth himself to the ground .</p>

   <p>FEBRUARIE . ÆGLOGA SECUNDA . ARGUMENT .</p>
   <p>This Æglogue is rather moral and general than bent to any secret or particular purpose . It specially containeth a discourse of old age , in the person of Thenot , an old shepheard , who , for his crookedness and unlustiness , is scorned of Cuddie , an unhappy herdman 's boy . The matter very well accordeth with the season of the moneth , the year now drooping , and as it were drawing to his last age . For as in this time of year , so then in our bodies , there is a dry and withering cold , which congealeth the curdled blood , and freezeth the weather-beaten flesh , with storms of Fortune and hoar-frosts of Care . To which purpose the old man telleth a tale of the Oak and the Brier , so lively , and so feelingly , as , if the thing were set forth in some picture before our eyes , more plainly could not appear .</p>
   <p>CUDDIE . THENOT .</p>
   <p>CUDDIE . Ah for pity ! will rank winter 's rage These bitter blasts never gin t'assuage ? The keen cold blows through my beaten hide , All as I were through the body gride : My ragged ronts all shiver and shake , As doen high towers in an earthquake : They wont in the wind wag their wriggle tails Perk as a peacock ; but now it availes . THE . Lewdly complainest , thou lazy lad , Of winter 's wrack for making thee sad . Must not the world wend in his common course , From good to bad , and from bad to worse , From worse unto that is worst of all , And then return to his former fall ? Who will not suffer the stormy time , Where will he live till the lusty prime ? Self have I worn out thrice thirty years , Some in much joy , many in many tears , Yet never complained of cold nor heat , Of summer 's flame , nor of winter 's threat , Ne ever was to Fortune foeman , But gently took that ungently came ; And ever my flock was my chief care ; Winter or summer they might well fare . CUD . No marvel , Thenot , if thou can bear Cheerfully the winter 's wrathful cheer ; For age and winter accord full nigh , This chill , that cold ; this crooked , that wry ; And as the louring weather looks down , So seemest thou like Good Friday<span type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>to frown : But my flow'ring youth is foe to frost , My ship unwont in storms to be tost . THE . The sovereign of seas he blames in vain , That , once sea-beat , will to sea again : So loit'ring live you little herdgrooms , Keeping your beasts in the budded brooms ; And , when the shining sun laugheth once , You deemen , the spring is come at once ; Then gin you , fond flies ! the cold to scorn , And , crowing in pipes made of green corn , You thinken to be lords of the year ; But eft , when ye count you freed from fear , Comes the breme Winter with chamfred brows , Full of wrinkles and frosty furrows , Drearily shooting his stormy dart , Which curdles the blood and pricks the heart : Then is your careless courage accoyed , Your careful herds with cold be annoyed : Then pay you the price of your surquedry , With weeping , and wailing , and misery . CUD . Ah ! foolish old man ! I scorn thy skill , That wouldst me my springing youth to spill : I deem thy brain emperished be Through rusty eld , that hath rotted thee ; Or sicker thy head very totty is , So on thy corb shoulder it leans amiss . Now thyself hath lost both lop and top , Als my budding branch thou wouldest crop ; But were thy years green , as now be mine , To other delights they would incline : Then wouldest thou learn to carol of love , And hery with hymns thy lass 's glove ; Then wouldest thou pipe of Phillis ’ praise ; But Phillis is mine for many days ; I won her with a girdle of gelt , Embost with bugle about the belt : Such an one shepheards would make full fain ; Such an one would make thee young again . THE . Thou art a fon , of thy love to boast ; All that is lent to love will be lost . CUD . Seest how brag yond bullock bears , So smirk , so smooth , his pricked ears ? His horns be as broad as rainbow bent , His dewlap as lithe as lass of Kent : See how he venteth into the wind ; Weenest of love is not his mind ? Seemeth thy flock thy counsel can , So lustless be they , so weak , so wan ; Clothed with cold , and hoary with frost , Thy flock 's father his courage hath lost . Thy ewes , that wont to have blowen bags , Like wailful widows hangen their crags ; The rather lambs be starved with cold , All for their master is lustless and old . THE . Cuddie , I wot thou kenst little good , So vainly to advance thy heedlesshood ; For youth is a bubble blown up with breath , Whose wit is weakness , whose wage is death , Whose way is wilderness , whose inn penance , And stoop-gallant Age , the host of Grievance . But shall I tell thee a tale of truth , Which I cond of Tityrus in my youth , Keeping his sheep on the hills of Kent ? CUD . To nought more , Thenot , my mind is bent Than to hear novels of his devise ; They be so well thewed , and so wise , Whatever that good old man bespake . THE . Many meet tales of youth did he make , And some of love , and some of chivalry ; But none fitter than this to apply . Now listen a while and hearken the end . “ There grew an aged tree on the green , A goodly Oak sometime had it been , With arms full strong and largely display 'd , But of their leaves they were disarray 'd : The body big , and mightily pight , Throughly rooted , and of wondrous height ; Whilome had been the king of the field , And mochell mast to the husband did yield , And with his nuts larded many swine : But now the gray moss marred his rine ; His bared boughs were beaten with storms , His top was bald , and wasted with worms , His honour decayed , his branches sere . “ Hard by his side grew a bragging Brere , Which proudly thrust into th ’ element , And seemed to threat the firmament : It was embellish 'd with blossoms fair , And thereto aye wonted to repair The shepheards ’ daughters to gather flowers , To paint their garlands with his colours ; And in his small bushes used to shroud The sweet nightingale singing so loud ; Which made this foolish Brere wax so bold , That on a time he cast him to scold And snebbe the good Oak , for he was old . “ ‘ Why standst there ( quoth he ) thou brutish block ? Nor for fruit nor for shadow serves thy stock ; Seest how fresh my flowers be spread , Dyed in lily white and crimson red , With leaves engrained in lusty green ; Colours meet to clothe a maiden queen ? Thy waste bigness but cumbers the ground , And dirks the beauty of my blossoms round : The mouldy moss , which thee accloyeth , My cinnamon smell too much annoyeth : Wherefore soon I rede thee hence remove , Lest thou the price of my displeasure prove . ’ So spake this bold Brere with great disdain : Little him answered the Oak again , But yielded , with shame and grief adawed , That of a weed he was overcrawed . “ It chanced after upon a day , The husbandman self to come that way , Of custom for to surview his ground , And his trees of state in compass round : Him when the spiteful Brere had espied , Causeless complained , and loudly cried Unto his lord , stirring up stern strife : “ ‘ O my liege lord ! the god of my life , Pleaseth you ponder your suppliant 's plaint , Caused of wrong and cruel constraint , Which I your poor vassal daily endure ; And , but your goodness the same recure , Am like for desperate dool to die , Through felonous force of mine enemy . ’ “ Greatly aghast with this piteous plea , Him rested the goodman on the lea , And bade the Brere in his plaint proceed . With painted words then gan this proud weed ( As most usen ambitious folk ) His coloured crime with craft to cloak . “ ‘ Ah , my sovereign ! lord of creatures all , Thou placer of plants both humble and tall , Was not I planted of thine own hand , To be the primrose of all thy land ; With flow'ring blossoms to furnish the prime , And scarlet berries in summer time ? How falls it then that this faded Oak , Whose body is sere , whose branches broke , Whose naked arms stretch unto the fire , Unto such tyranny doth aspire ; Hindering with his shade my lovely light , And robbing me of the sweet sun 's sight ? So beat his old boughs my tender side , That oft the blood springeth from woundës wide ; Untimely my flowers forced to fall , That be the honour of your coronal : And oft he lets his canker-worms light Upon my branches , to work me more spite ; And oft his hoary locks down doth cast , Wherewith my fresh flow'rets be defast : For this , and many more such outrage , Craving your goodlyhead to assuage The rancorous rigour of his might ; Nought ask I , but only to hold my right ; Submitting me to your good sufferance , And praying to be guarded from grievance . ’ “ To this this Oak cast him to reply Well as he couth ; but his enemy Had kindled such coals of displeasure , That the goodman nould stay his leisure , But home him hasted with furious heat , Increasing his wrath with many a threat : His harmful hatchet he hent in hand , ( Alas ! that it so ready should stand ! ) And to the field alone he speedeth , ( Aye little help to harm there needeth ! ) Anger nould let him speak to the tree , Enaunter his rage might cooled be ; But to the root bent his sturdy stroke , And made many wounds in the waste Oak . The axe 's edge did oft turn again , As half unwilling to cut the grain ; Seemed , the senseless iron did fear , Or to wrong holy eld did forbear ; For it had been an ancient tree , Sacred with many a mystery , And often cross 'd with the priests ’ crew , And often hallowed with holy-water dew : But sike fancies weren foolery , And broughten this Oak to this misery ; For nought might they quitten him from decay , For fiercely the goodman at him did lay . The block oft groaned under the blow , And sighed to see his near overthrow . In fine , the steel had pierced his pith , Then down to the earth he fell forthwith . His wondrous weight made the ground to quake , Th ’ earth shrunk under him , and seemed to shake :— There lieth the Oak , pitied of none ! “ Now stands the Brere like a lord alone , Puffed up with pride and vain pleasance ; But all this glee had no continuance : For eftsoons winter gan to approach ; The blust'ring Boreas did encroach , And beat upon the solitary Brere ; For now no succour was seen him near . Now gan he repent his pride too late ; For , naked left and disconsolate , The biting frost nipt his stalk dead , The watry wet weighed down his head , And heaped snow burden 'd him so sore , That now upright he can stand no more ; And , being down , is trod in the durt Of cattle , and broused , and sorely hurt . Such was th ’ end of this ambitious Brere , For scorning eld — ” CUD . Now I pray thee , shepheard , tell it not forth : Here is a long tale , and little worth . So long have I listened to thy speech , That graffed to the ground is my breech ; My heartblood is well nigh frorne I feel , And my galage grown fast to my heel ; But little ease of thy lewd tale I tasted : Hie thee home , shepheard , the day is nigh wasted .</p>

   <p>MARCH . ÆGLOGA TERTIA . ARGUMENT .</p>
   <p>In this Æglogue two Shepheards ’ Boys , taking occasion of the season , begin to make purpose of love , and other pleasance which to springtime is most agreeable . The special meaning hereof is , to give certain marks and tokens , to know Cupid the poets ’ god of Love . But more particularly , I think , in the person of Thomalin , is meant some secret friend , who scorned Love and his knights so long , till at length himself was entangled , and unwares wounded with the dart of some beautiful regard , which is Cupid 's arrow .</p>
   <p>WILLY . THOMALIN .</p>
   <p>WILLY . Thomalin , why sitten we so , As weren overwent with woe , Upon so fair a morrow ? The joyous time now nigheth fast , That shall alegge this bitter blast , And slake the winter sorrow . THO . Sicker , Willy , thou warnest well ; For winter 's wrath begins to quell , And pleasant spring appeareth : The grass now gins to be refresht , The swallow peeps out of her nest , And cloudy welkin cleareth . WIL . Seest not thilk same hawthorn stud , How bragly it begins to bud , And utter his tender head ? Flora now calleth forth each flower , And bids make ready Maia 's bower That new is uprist from bed : Then shall we sporten in delight , And learn with Lettice to wax light , That scornfully looks askance ; Then will we little Love awake , That now sleepeth in Lethe lake , And pray him leaden our dance . THO . Willy , I ween thou be assot ; For lusty Love still sleepeth not , But is abroad at his game . WIL . How kenst thou that he is awoke ? Or hast thyself his slumber broke ? Or made privy to the same ? THO . No ; but happily I him spied , Where in a bush he did him hide , With wings of purple and blue ; And , were not that my sheep would stray , The privy marks I would bewray , Whereby by chance I him knew . WIL . Thomalin , have no care forthy ; Myself will have a double eye , Alike to my flock and thine ; For , alas ! at home I have a sire , A stepdame eke , as hot as fire , That duly adays counts mine . THO . Nay , but thy seeing will not serve , My sheep for that may chance to swerve , And fall into some mischief : For sithens is but the third morrow That I chanc 'd to fall asleep with sorrow , And waked again with grief ; The while thilk same unhappy ewe , Whose clouted leg her hurt doth shew , Fell headlong into a dell , And there unjointed both her bones : Might her neck been jointed attones , She should have need no more spell ; Th ’ elf was so wanton and so wood , ( But now I trow can better good ,) She might ne gang on the green . WIL . Let be , as may be , that is past ; That is to come , let be forecast : Now tell us what thou hast seen . THO . It was upon a holiday , When shepheards ’ grooms have leave to play , I cast to go a shooting ; Long wand'ring up and down the land , With bow and bolts in either hand , For birds in bushes tooting , At length within the ivy tod , ( There shrouded was the little god ,) I heard a busy bustling ; I bent my bolt against the bush , List'ning if any thing did rush , But then heard no more rustling . Then , peeping close into the thick , Might see the moving of some quick , Whose shape appeared not ; But were it faery , fiend , or snake , My courage yearn 'd it to awake , And manfully thereat shot : With that sprang forth a naked swain ; With spotted wings like peacock 's train , And laughing lope to a tree ; His gilden quiver at his back , And silver bow , which was but slack , Which lightly he bent at me : That seeing , I levell 'd again , And shot at him with might and main , As thick as it had hailed . So long I shot , that all was spent ; Then pumie stones I hast'ly hent , And threw ; but nought availed : He was so wimble and so wight , From bough to bough he leaped light , And oft the pumies latched : Therewith afraid I ran away ; But he , that erst seem 'd but to play , A shaft in earnest snatched , And hit me running in the heel : For then I little smart did feel , But soon it sore increased ; And now it rankleth more and more , And inwardly it fest'reth sore , Ne wote I how to cease it . WIL . Thomalin , I pity thy plight , Perdie with Love thou didest fight ; I know him by a token : For once I heard my father say , How he him caught upon a day , ( Whereof he will be wroken ,) Entangled in a fowling net , Which he for carrion crows had set That in our pear-tree haunted : Then said , he was a winged lad , But bow and shafts as then none had , Else had he sore been daunted . But see , the welkin thicks apace , And stooping Phoebus steeps his face ; It 's time to haste us homeward .</p>

   <p>APRIL . ÆGLOGA QUARTA . ARGUMENT .</p>
   <p>This Æglogue is purposely intended to the honour and praise of our most gracious sovereign , Queen Elizabeth . The speakers hereof be Hobbinol and Thenot , two shepheards : the which Hobbinol , being beforementioned greatly to have loved Colin , is here set forth more largely , complaining him of that boy 's great misadventure in love ; whereby his mind was alienated and withdrawn not only from him , who most loved him , but also from all former delights and studies , as well in pleasant piping , as cunning rhyming and singing , and other his laudable exercises . Whereby he taketh occasion , for proof of his more excellency and skill in poetry , to record a song , which the said Colin sometime made in honour of her Majesty , whom abruptly he termeth Elisa .</p>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>THENOT . HOBBINOL .</head>
    <head>THENOT . Tell me , good Hobbinol , what gars thee greet ? What ! hath some wolf thy tender lambs ytorn ? Or is thy bagpipe broke , that sounds so sweet ? Or art thou of thy loved lass forlorn ? Or be thine eyes attemper 'd to the year , Quenching the gasping furrows ’ thirst with rain ? Like April shower , so stream the trickling tears Adown thy cheek , to quench thy thirsty pain . HOB . Nor this , nor that , so much doth make me mourn , But for the lad , whom long I lov 'd so dear , Now loves a lass that all his love doth scorn : He , plunged in pain , his tressed locks doth tear ; Shepheard 's delights he doth them all forswear ; His pleasant pipe , which made us merriment , He wilfully hath broke , and doth forbear His wonted songs wherein he all outwent . THE . What is he for a lad you so lament ? Is love such pinching pain to them that prove ? And hath he skill to make so excellent , Yet hath so little skill to bridle love ? HOB . Colin thou kenst , the southern shepheard 's boy ; Him Love hath wounded with a deadly dart : Whilome on him was all my care and joy , Forcing with gifts to win his wanton heart . But now from me his madding mind is start , And wooes the widow 's daughter of the glen ; So now fair Rosalind hath bred his smart ; So now his friend is changed for a frenne . THE . But if his ditties be so trimly dight , I pray thee , Hobbinol , record some one , The whiles our flocks do graze about in sight , And we close shrouded in this shade alone . HOB . Contented I : then will I sing his lay Of fair Elisa , queen of shepheards all , Which once he made as by a spring he lay , And tuned it unto the waters ’ fall .</head>

   <p>MAY . ÆGLOGA QUINTA . ARGUMENT .</p>
   <p>In this fifth Æglogue , under the person of two shepheards , Piers and Palinode , be represented two forms of Pastors or Ministers , or the Protestant and the Catholic ; whose chief talk standeth in reasoning , whether the life of the one must be like the other ; with whom having shewed , that it is dangerous to maintain any fellowship , or give too much credit to their colourable and feigned good-will , he telleth him a tale of the Fox , that , by such a counterpoint of craftiness , deceived and devoured the credulous Kid .</p>
   <p>PALINODE . PIERS .</p>
   <p>PALINODE . Is not thilk the merry month of May , When love-lads masken in fresh array ? How falls it , then , we no merrier bene , Alike as others , girt in gaudy green ? Our bloncket liveries be all too sad For thilk same season , when all is yclad With pleasance ; the ground with grass , the woods With green leaves , the bushes with blooming buds . Youth 's folk now flocken in every where , To gather May-buskets and smelling brere ; And home they hasten the posts to dight , And all the kirk-pillars ere day-light , With hawthorn buds , and sweet eglantine , And garlands of roses , and sops-in-wine . Such merrimake holy saints doth queme , But we here sitten as drown 'd in dream . PIERS . For younkers , Palinode , such follies fit , But we tway be men of elder wit . PAL . Sicker this morrow , no longer ago , I saw a shoal of shepheards outgo With singing , and shouting , and jolly cheer : Before them yode a lusty tabrere , That to the many a horn-pipe play 'd , Whereto they dancen each one with his maid . To see those folks make such jovisance , Made my heart after the pipe to dance : Then to the green wood they speeden them all , To fetchen home May with their musical ; And home they bringen in a royal throne , Crowned as king ; and his queen attone Was Lady Flora , on whom did attend A fair flock of faeries , and a fresh bend Of lovely nymphs . ( O that I were there , To helpen the ladies their Maybush bear ! ) Ah ! Piers , be not thy teeth on edge , to think How great sport they gainen with little swink ? PIERS . Perdie , so far am I from envy , That their fondness inly I pity : Those faitours little regarden their charge , While they , letting their sheep run at large , Passen their time , that should be sparely spent , In lustihed and wanton merriment . Thilk same be shepheards for the devil 's stead , That playen while their flocks be unfed : Well it is seen their sheep be not their own , That letten them run at random alone : But they be hired for little pay Of other , that caren as little as they , What fallen the flock , so they have the fleece , And get all the gain , paying but a piece . I muse , what account both these will make ; The one for the hire , which he doth take , And th ’ other for leaving his Lord 's task , When great Pan account of shepheards shall ask . PAL . Sicker , now I see thou speakest of spite , All for thou lackest somdele their delight . I ( as I am ) had rather be envied , All were it of my foe , than fonly pitied ; And yet , if need were , pitied would be , Rather than other should scorn at me ; For pitied is mishap that n'as remedy , But scorned be deeds of fond foolery . What shoulden shepheards other things tend , Than , sith their God his good does them send , Reapen the fruit thereof , that is pleasure , The while they here liven at ease and leisure ? For , when they be dead , their good is ygoe , They sleepen in rest , well as other moe : Then with them wends what they spent in cost , But what they left behind them is lost . Good is no good , but if it be spend ; God giveth good for none other end . PIERS . Ah ! Palinode , thou art a world 's child : Who touches pitch , must needs be defil 'd ; But shepheards ( as Algrind<span type="note_anchor">[ 7 ]</span>used to say ) Must not live alike as men of the lay . With them it sits to care for their heir , Enaunter their heritage do impair : They must provide for means of maintenance , And to continue their wont countenance : But shepheard must walk another way , Sike worldly sovenance he must for-say . The son of his loins why should he regard To leave enriched with that he hath spar 'd ? Should not thilk God , that gave him that good , Eke cherish his child , if in his ways he stood ? For if he mislive in lewdness and lust , Little boots all the wealth , and the trust , That his father left by inheritance ; All will be soon wasted with misgovernance : But through this , and other their miscreance , They maken many a wrong chevisance , Heaping up waves of wealth and woe , The floods whereof shall them overflow . Sike men 's folly I cannot compare Better than to the ape 's foolish care , That is so enamoured of her young one , ( And yet , God wot , such cause had she none ,) That with her hard hold , and strait embracing , She stoppeth the breath of her youngling . So oftentimes , whenas good is meant , Evil ensueth of wrong intent . The time was once , and may again retorn , ( For ought may happen , that hath been beforn ,) When shepheards had none inheritance , Ne of land nor fee in sufferance , But what might arise of the bare sheep , ( Were it more or less ) which they did keep . Well ywis was it with shepheards then : Nought having , nought feared they to forego ; For Pan himself was their inheritance , And little them served for their maintenance . The shepheards ’ God so well them guided , That of nought they were unprovided ; Butter enough , honey , milk , and whey , And their flocks ’ fleeces them to array : But tract of time , and long prosperity , ( That nurse of vice , this of insolency ,) Lulled the shepheards in such security , That , not content with loyal obeisance , Some gan to gape for greedy governance , And match them self with mighty potentates , Lovers of lordship , and troublers of states : Then gan shepheards ’ swains to look aloft , And leave to live hard , and learn to ligg soft : Then , under colour of shepheards , somewhile There crept in wolves , full of fraud and guile , That often devoured their own sheep , And often the shepheards that did them keep : This was the first source of shepheards ’ sorrow , That now nill be quit with bail nor borrow . PAL . Three things to bear be very burdenous , But the fourth to forbear is outrageous : Women , that of love 's longing once lust , Hardly forbearen , but have it they must : So when choler is inflamed with rage , Wanting revenge , is hard to assuage : And who can counsel a thirsty soul , With patience to forbear the offer 'd bowl ? But of all burdens , that a man can bear , Most is , a fool 's talk to bear and to hear . I ween the giant has not such a weight , That bears on his shoulders the heaven 's height . Thou findest fault where n'is to be found , And buildest strong work upon a weak ground : Thou railest on right withouten reason , And blamest them much for small encheason . How shoulden shepheards live , if not so ? What ? should they pinen in pain and woe ? Nay , say I thereto , by my dear borrow , If I may rest , I nill live in sorrow . Sorrow ne need be hastened on , For he will come , without calling , anon , While times enduren of tranquillity , Usen we freely our felicity ; For , when approachen the stormy stowres , We must with our shoulders bear off the sharp showers ; And , sooth to sayn , nought seemeth sike strife , That shepheards so witen each other 's life , And layen their faults the worlds beforn , The while their foes do each of them scorn . Let none mislike of that may not be mended ; So contest soon by concord might be ended . PIERS . Shepheard , I list no accordance make With shepheard , that does the right way forsake ; And of the twain , if choice were to me , Had lever my foe than my friend he be ; For what concord have light and dark sam ? Or what peace has the lion with the lamb ? Such faitours , when their false hearts be hid , Will do as did the Fox by the Kid .<span type="note_anchor">[ 8 ]</span>PAL . Now , Piers , of fellowship , tell us that saying ; For the lad can keep both our flocks from straying . PIERS . Thilk same Kid ( as I can well devise ) Was too very foolish and unwise ; For on a time , in summer season , The Goat her dam , that had good reason , Yode forth abroad unto the green wood , To brouze , or play , or what she thought good : But , for she had a motherly care Of her young son , and wit to beware , She set her youngling before her knee , That was both fresh and lovely to see , And full of favour as kid might be . His velvet head began to shoot out , And his wreathed horns gan newly sprout ; The blossoms of lust to bud did begin , And spring forth rankly under his chin . “ My son , ” ( quoth she , and with that gan weep ; For careful thoughts in her heart did creep ;) “ God bless thee , poor orphan ! as he might me , And send thee joy of thy jollity . Thy father , ” ( that word she spake with pain , For a sigh had nigh rent her heart in twain ,) “ Thy father , had he lived this day , To see the branch of his body display , How would he have joyed at this sweet sight ? But ah ! false Fortune such joy did him spite , And cut off his days with untimely woe , Betraying him into the trains of his foe . Now I , a wailful widow behight , Of my old age have this one delight , To see thee succeed in thy father 's stead , And flourish in flowers of lustihead ; For even so thy father his head upheld , And so his haughty horns did he weld . ” Then marking him with melting eyes , A thrilling throb from her heart did arise , And interrupted all her other speech With some old sorrow that made a new breach ; Seemed she saw in her youngling 's face The old lineaments of his father 's grace . At last her sullen silence she broke , And gan his new-budded beard to stroke . “ Kiddie , ” ( quoth she ,) “ thou kenst the great care I have of thy health and thy welfare , Which many wild beasts liggen in wait For to entrap in thy tender state : But most the Fox , master of collusion ; For he has vowed thy last confusion . Forthy , my Kiddie , be rul 'd by me , And never give trust to his treachery ; And , if he chance come when I am abroad , Sperr the gate fast , for fear of fraud ; Ne for all his worst , nor for his best , Open the door at his request . ” So schooled the Goat her wanton son , That answer 'd his mother , all should be done . Then went the pensive dam out of door , And chanc 'd to stumble at the threshold floor ; Her stumbling step somewhat her amazed , ( For such , as signs of ill luck , be dispraised ;) Yet forth she yode , thereat half aghast ; And Kiddie the door sperred after her fast . It was not long , after she was gone , But the false Fox came to the door anone ; Not as a fox , for then he had be kend , But all as a poor pedlar he did wend , Bearing a truss of trifles at his back , As bells , and babes , and glasses , in his pack : A biggen he had got about his brain , For in his headpiece he felt a sore pain : His hinder heel was wrapt in a clout , For with great cold he had got the gout : There at the door he cast me down his pack , And laid him down , and groaned , “ Alack ! alack ! Ah ! dear Lord ! and sweet Saint Charity ! That some good body would once pity me ! ” Well heard Kiddie all this sore constraint , And long 'd to know the cause of his complaint ; Then , creeping close behind the wicket 's clink , Privily he peeped out through a chink , Yet not so privily but the Fox him spied ; For deceitful meaning is double-eyed . “ Ah ! good young master , ” ( then gan he cry ,) “ Jesus bless that sweet face I espy , And keep your corpse from the careful stounds That in my carrion carcase abounds . ” The Kid , pitying his heaviness , Asked the cause of his great distress , And also who , and whence that he were . Then he , that had well yconn 'd his lere , Thus medled his talk with many a tear : “ Sick , sick , alas ! and little lack of dead , But I be relieved by your beastlyhead . I am a poor sheep , albe my colour dun , For with long travel I am brent in the sun ; And if that , my grandsire me said , be true , Sicker , I am very sib to you ; So be your goodlihead do not disdain The base kindred of so simple swain . Of mercy and favour then I you pray , With your aid to forestall my near decay . ” Then out of his pack a glass he took , Wherein while Kiddie unwares did look , He was so enamoured with the newell , That nought he deemed dear for the jewel : Then opened he the door , and in came The false Fox , as he were stark lame : His tail he clapt betwixt his legs twain , Lest he should be descried by his train . Being within , the Kid made him good glee , All for the love of the glass he did see . After his cheer , the pedlar gan chat , And tell many leasings of this and that , And how he could shew many a fine knack ; Then shewed his ware and opened his pack , All save a bell , which he left behind In the basket for the Kid to find ; Which when the Kid stooped down to catch , He popt him in , and his basket did latch ; Ne stayed he once the door to make fast , But ran away with him in all hast . Home when the doubtful dame had her hied , She might see the door stand open wide ; All aghast , loudly she gan to call Her Kid ; but he nould answer at all : Then on the floor she saw the merchandice Of which her son had set too dear a price . What help ! her Kid she knew well was gone : She weeped , and wailed , and made great moan . Such end had the Kid , for he nould warned be Of craft , coloured with simplicity ; And such end , perdie , does all them remain , That of such falsers ’ friendship be fain . PAL . Truly , Piers , thou art beside thy wit , Furthest fro the mark , weening it to hit . Now , I pray thee , let me thy tale borrow For our Sir John ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 9 ]</span>to say to-morrow At the kirk when it is holiday ; For well he means , but little can say . But , and if foxes be so crafty as so , Much needeth all shepheards them to know . PIERS . Of their falsehood more could I recount , But now the bright sun ginneth to dismount ; And , for the dewy night now doth nigh , I hold it best for us home to hie .</p>

For being ( as is aforesaid ) enamoured of a country lass Rosalind , and having ( as seemeth ) found place in her heart , he lamenteth to his dear friend Hobbinol , that he is now forsaken unfaithfully , and in his stead Menalcas , another shepheard , received disloyally .

   <p>JULY . ÆGLOGA SEPTIMA . ARGUMENT .</p>
   <p>This Æglogue is made in the honour and commendation of good shepheards , and to the shame and dispraise of proud and ambitious pastors : such as Morrell is here imagined to be .</p>
   <p>THOMALIN . MORRELL .<span type="note_anchor">[ 11 ]</span></p>
   <p>THOMALIN . Is not thilk same a goatherd proud , That sits on yonder bank , Whose straying herd them self doth shroud Among the bushes rank ? MOR . What , ho , thou jolly shepheard 's swain , Come up the hill to me ; Better is than the lowly plain , Als for thy flock and thee . THOM . Ah ! God shield , man , that I should climb , And learn to look aloft ; This rede is rife , that oftentime Great climbers fall unsoft . In humble dales is footing fast , The trode is not so tickle , And though one fall through heedless hast , Yet is his miss not mickle . And now the Sun<span type="note_anchor">[ 12 ]</span>hath reared up His fiery-footed team , Making his way between the Cup And golden Diademe ; The rampant Lion hunts he fast , With dogs of noisome breath , Whose baleful barking brings in hast Pine , plagues , and dreary death . Against his cruel scorching heat , Where thou hast coverture , The wasteful hills unto his threat Is a plain overture : But , if thee list to holden chat With seely shepheard 's swain , Come down , and learn the little what , That Thomalin can sayn . MOR . Siker thou 's but a lazy loord , And recks much of thy swink , That with fond terms , and witless words , To blear mine eyes dost think . In evil hour thou hentst in hand Thus holy hills to blame , For sacred unto saints they stand , And of them have their name . St. Michel 's Mount who does not know , That wards the Western coast ? And of St. Bridget 's Bower I trow All Kent can rightly boast : And they that con of Muses ’ skill Sayn most-what , that they dwell ( As goatherds wont ) upon a hill , Beside a learned well . And wonned not the great good Pan Upon Mount Olivet , Feeding the blessed flock of Dan , Which did himself beget ? THOM . O blessed Sheep ! O Shepheard great ! That bought his flock so dear , And them did save with bloody sweat From wolves that would them tear . MOR . Beside , as holy Fathers sayn , There is a holy place Where Titan riseth from the main To run his daily race , Upon whose top the stars be stay 'd , And all the sky doth lean ; There is the cave where Phoebe laid The shepheard long to dream . Whilome there used shepheards all To feed their flocks at will , Till by his folly one did fall , That all the rest did spill . And , sithens shepheards be foresaid From places of delight , Forthy I ween thou be afraid To climb this hillës height . Of Sinai can I tell thee more , And of our Lady 's Bower ; But little needs to strow my store , Suffice this hill of our . Here have the holy Fauns recourse , And Sylvans haunten rathe ; Here has the salt Medway his source , Wherein the Nymphs do bathe ; The salt Medway , that trickling streams Adown the dales of Kent , Till with his elder brother Themes His brackish waves be ment . Here grows melampode every where , And terebinth , good for goats ; The one my madding kids to smear , The next to heal their throats . Hereto , the hills be nigher heaven , And then the passage eath ; As well can prove the piercing levin , That seldom falls beneath . THOM . Siker thou speaks like a lewd lorrell , Of heaven to deemen so ; How be I am but rude and borrell , Yet nearer ways I know . To kirk the narre , from God more far , Has been an old-said saw ; And he , that strives to touch a star , Oft stumbles at a straw . As soon may shepheard climb to sky That leads in lowly dales , As goatherd proud , that , sitting high , Upon the mountain sails . My seely sheep like well below , They need not melampode , For they be hale enough , I trow , And liken their abode ; But , if they with thy goats should yede , They soon might be corrupted , Or like not of the frowy feed , Or with the weeds be glutted . The hills , where dwelled holy saints , I reverence and adore , Not for themself , but for the saints Which have been dead of yore . And now they be to heaven forewent , Their good is with them go ; Their sample only to us lent , That als we might do so . Shepheards they weren of the best , And lived in lowly leas ; And , sith they souls be now at rest , Why do we them disease ? Such one he was ( as I have heard Old Algrind often sayn ) That whilome was the first shepheard , And lived with little gain : And meek he was , as meek might be , Simple as simple sheep ; Humble , and like in each degree The flock which he did keep . Often he used of his keep A sacrifice to bring , Now with a kid , now with a sheep , The altars hallowing . So louted he unto his Lord , Such favour couth he find , That never sithens was abhorr 'd The simple shepheards ’ kind . And such , I ween , the brethren were That came from Canaän , The brethren Twelve , that kept yfere The flocks of mighty Pan . But nothing such thilk shepheard was Whom Ida hill did bear , That left his flock to fetch a lass , Whose love he bought too dear . For he was proud , that ill was paid , ( No such must shepheards be ! ) And with lewd lust was overlaid ; Two things doen ill agree . But shepheard must be meek and mild , Well-eyed , as Argus was , With fleshly follies undefiled , And stout as steed of brass . Such one ( said Algrind ) Moses was , That saw his Maker 's face , His face , more clear then crystal glass , And spake to him in place . This had a brother , ( his name I knew ,) The first of all his cote , A shepheard true , yet not so true As he that erst I hote . Whilome all these were low and lief , And loved their flocks to feed ; They never stroven to be chief , And simple was their weed : But now ( thanked be God therefore ! ) The world is well amend , Their weeds be not so nighly wore ; Such simplesse might them shend ! They be yclad in purple and pall , So hath their God them blist ; They reign and rulen over all , And lord it as they list ; Ygirt with belts of glittering gold , ( Might they good shepheards been ! ) Their Pan their sheep to them has sold , I say as some have seen . For Palinode ( if thou him ken ) Yode late on pilgrimage To Rome , ( if such be Rome ,) and then He saw thilk misusage ; For shepheards ( said he ) there doen lead , As lords done other where ; Their sheep have crusts , and they the bread ; The chips , and they the cheer : They have the fleece , and eke the flesh , ( O seely sheep the while ! ) The corn is theirs , let others thresh , Their hands they may not file . They have great store and thrifty stocks , Great friends and feeble foes ; What need them caren for their flocks , Their boys can look to those . These wisards welter in wealth 's waves , Pamper 'd in pleasures deep ; They have fat kerns , and leany knaves , Their fasting flocks to keep . Sike mister men be all misgone , They heapen hills of wrath ; Such surly shepheards have we none , They keepen all the path . MOR . Here is a great deal of good matter Lost for lack of telling ; Now sicker I see thou dost but clatter , Harm may come of melling . Thou meddlest more than shall have thank , To witen shepheards ’ wealth ; When folk be fat , and riches rank , It is a sign of health . But say me , what is Algrind , he That is so oft benempt ? THOM . He is a shepheard great in gree , But hath been long ypent : One day he sat upon a hill , As now thou wouldest me ; But I am taught , by Algrind 's ill , To love the low degree ; For sitting so with bared scalp , An eagle<span type="note_anchor">[ 13 ]</span>soared high , That , weening his white head was chalk , A shell-fish down let fly ; She ween 'd the shell-fish to have broke , But therewith bruis 'd his brain ; So now , astonied with the stroke , He lies in lingering pain . MOR . Ah ! good Algrind ! his hap was ill , But shall be better in time . Now farewell , shepheard , sith this hill Thou hast such doubt to climb .</p>

   <p>AUGUST . ÆGLOGA OCTAVA . ARGUMENT .</p>
   <p>In this Æglogue is set forth a delectable controversy , made in imitation of that in Theocritus : whereto also Virgil fashioned his third and seventh Æglogue . They chose for umpire of their strife , Cuddy , a neat-herd 's boy ; who , having ended their cause , reciteth also himself a proper song , whereof Colin he saith was author .</p>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>WILLIE . PERIGOT . CUDDIE .</head>
    <head>WILLIE . Tell me , Perigot , what shall be the game , Wherefore with mine thou dare thy music match ? Or be thy bagpipes run far out of frame ? Or hath the cramp thy joints benumb 'd with ache ? PER . Ah ! Willie , when the heart is ill assay 'd , How can bagpipe or joints be well apaid ? WIL . What the foul evil hath thee so bestad ? Whilome thou was peregall to the best , And wont to make the jolly shepheards glad , With piping and dancing didst pass the rest . PER . Ah ! Willie , now I have learn 'd a new dance ; My old music marr 'd by a new mischance . WIL . Mischief might to that mischance befall , That so hath reft us of our merriment ; But rede me what pain doth thee so appal ; Or lovest thou , or be thy younglings miswent ? PER . Love hath misled both my younglings and me ; I pine for pain , and they my pain to see . WIL . Perdie , and wellaway ! ill may they thrive ; Never knew I lover 's sheep in good plight : But and if in rhymes with me thou dare strive , Such fond fantasies shall soon be put to flight . PER . That shall I do , though mochell worse I fared : Never shall be said that Perigot was dared . WIL . Then lo , Perigot , the pledge which I plight , A mazer ywrought of the maple warre , Wherein is enchased many a fair sight Of bears and tigers , that maken fierce war ; And over them spread a goodly wild vine , Entrailed with a wanton ivy twine . Thereby is a lamb in the wolvës jaws ; But see , how fast runneth the shepheard swain To save the innocent from the beast 's paws , And here with his sheephook hath him slain . Tell me , such a cup hast thou ever seen ? Well might it beseem any harvest queen . PER . Thereto will I pawn yonder spotted lamb ; Of all my flock there n'is such another , For I brought him up without the dam ; But Colin Clout reft me of his brother , That he purchas 'd of me in the plain field ; Sore against my will was I forc 'd to yield . WIL . Sicker , make like account of his brother ; But who shall judge the wager won or lost ? PER . That shall yonder herdgroom and none other , Which over the pease hitherward doth post . WIL . But , for the sunbeam so sore doth us beat , Were not better to shun the scorching heat ? PER . Well agreed , Willie ; then set thee down , swain ; Such a song never heardest thou but Colin sing . CUD . ‘ Gin , when ye list , ye jolly shepheards twain ; Such a judge , as Cuddie , were for a king . PER . It fell upon a holy eve , WIL . Hey , ho , holiday ! PER . When holy Fathers wont to shrieve ; WIL . Now ginneth this roundelay . PER . Sitting upon a hill so high , WIL . Hey , ho , the high hill ! PER . The while my flock did feed thereby ; WIL . The while the shepheard self did spill ; PER . I saw the bouncing Bellibone , WIL . Hey , ho , Bonnibell ! PER . Tripping over the dale alone ; WIL . She can trip it very well . PER . Well decked in a frock of gray , WIL . Hey , ho , gray is greet ! PER . And in a kirtle of green saye , WIL . The green is for maidens meet . PER . A chapelet on her head she wore , WIL . Hey , ho , chapelet ! PER . Of sweet violets therein was store , WIL . She sweeter than the violet . PER . My sheep did leave their wonted food , WIL . Hey , ho , seely sheep ! PER . And gaz 'd on her as they were wood , WIL . Wood as he that did them keep . PER . As the bonilass passed by , WIL . Hey , ho , bonilass ! PER . She rov 'd at me with glancing eye , WIL . As clear as the crystal glass : PER . All as the sunny beam so bright , WIL . Hey , ho , the sun-beam ! PER . Glanceth from Phoebus ’ face forthright , WIL . So love into thy heart did stream : PER . Or as the thunder cleaves the clouds , WIL . Hey , ho , the thunder ! PER . Wherein the lightsome levin shrouds , WIL . So cleaves thy soul asunder : PER . Or as Dame Cynthia 's silver ray , WIL . Hey , ho , the moonlight ! PER . Upon the glittering wave doth play , WIL . Such play is a piteous plight . PER . The glance into my heart did glide , WIL . Hey , ho , the glider ! PER . Therewith my soul was sharply gryde , WIL . Such wounds soon waxen wider . PER . Hasting to wrench the arrow out , WIL . Hey , ho , Perigot ! PER . I left the head in my heart-root , WIL . It was a desperate shot . PER . There it rankleth aye more and more , WIL . Hey , ho , the arrow ! PER . Ne can I find salve for my sore , WIL . Love is a careless sorrow . PER . And though my bale with death I bought , WIL . Hey , ho , heavy cheer ! PER . Yet should thilk lass not from my thought , WIL . So you may buy gold too dear . PER . But whether in painful love I pine , WIL . Hey , ho , pinching pain ! PER . Or thrive in wealth , she shall be mine , WIL . But if thou can her obtain . PER . And if for graceless grief I die , WIL . Hey , ho , graceless grief ! PER . Witness she slew me with her eye , WIL . Let thy folly be the prief . PER . And you , that saw it , simple sheep , WIL . Hey , ho , the fair flock ! PER . For prief thereof , my death shall weep , WIL . And moan with many a mock . PER . So learn 'd I love on a holy eve , WIL . Hey , ho , holy-day ! PER . That ever since my heart did grieve , WIL . Now endeth our roundelay . ” CUD . Sicker , such a roundel never heard I none ; Little lacketh Perigot of the best , And Willie is not greatly overgone , So weren his under-songs well addrest . WIL . Herdgroom , I fear me thou have a squint eye ; Arede uprightly , who has the victory . CUD . Faith of my soul , I deem each have gained ; Forthy let the lamb be Willie his own ; And for Perigot , so well hath him pained , To him be the wroughten mazer alone . PER . Perigot is well pleased with the doom , Ne can Willie wite the witeless herdgroom . WIL . Never dempt more right of beauty , I ween , The shepheard of Ida that judged Beauty 's queen . CUD . But tell me , shepheards , should it not yshend Your roundels fresh , to hear a doleful verse Of Rosalind ( who knows not Rosalind ? ) That Colin made ? ilk can I you rehearse . PER . Now say it , Cuddie , as thou art a lad ; With merry thing it 's good to medle sad . WIL . Faith of my soul , thou shalt ycrowned be In Colin 's stead , if thou this song arede ; For never thing on earth so pleaseth me As him to hear , or matter of his deed . CUD . Then listen each unto my heavy lay , And tune your pipes as ruthful as ye may .</head>

   <p>DIGGON 'S EMBLEME ]</p>
   <p>SEPTEMBER . ÆGLOGA NONA . ARGUMENT .</p>
   <p>Herein Diggon Davie is devised to be a shepheard that , in hope of more gain , drove his sheep into a far country . The abuses whereof , and loose living of Popish prelates , by occasion of Hobbinol 's demand , he discourseth at large .</p>
   <p>HOBBINOL . DIGGON DAVIE .</p>
   <p>HOBBINOL . Diggon Davie ! I bid her good-day ; Or Diggon her is , or I missay . DIG . Her was her , while it was day-light , But now her is a most wretched wight : For day , that was , is wightly past , And now at erst the dark night doth hast . HOB . Diggon , arede who has thee so dight ; Never I wist thee in so poor a plight . Where is the fair flock thou wast wont to lead ? Or be they chaffred , or at mischief dead ? DIG . Ah ! for love of that is to thee most lief , Hobbinol , I pray thee gall not my old grief ; Such question rippeth up cause of new woe , For one , opened , might unfold many moe . HOB . Nay , but sorrow close shrouded in heart , I know , to keep is a burdenous smart : Each thing imparted is more eath to bear : When the rain is fallen , the clouds waxen clear . And now , sithence I saw thy head last , Thrice three moons be fully spent and past ; Since when thou hast measured much ground , And wandered well about the world round , So as thou can many things relate ; But tell me first of thy flock 's estate . DIG . My sheep be wasted ; ( woe is me therefore ! ) The jolly shepheard that was of yore , Is now nor jolly , nor shepheard more . In foreign coasts men said was plenty ; And so there is , but all of misery : I deem 'd there much to have eked my store , But such eking hath made my heart sore . In those countries , whereas I have been , No being for those that truly mean ; But for such , as of guile maken gain , No such country as there to remain ; They setten to sale their shops of shame , And maken a mart of their good name : The shepheards there robben one another , And layen baits to beguile their brother ; Or they will buy his sheep out of the cote , Or they will carven the shepheard 's throat . The shepheard 's swain you cannot well ken , But it be by his pride , from other men ; They looken big as bulls that be bate , And bearen the crag so stiff and so state , As cock on his dunghill crowing crank . HOB . Diggon , I am so stiff and so stank , that uneath may I stand any more ; And now the western wind bloweth sore , That now is in his chief sovereignty , Beating the withered leaf from the tree ; Sit we down here under the hill ; Then may we talk and tellen our fill , And make a mock at the blustering blast : Now say on , Diggon , whatever thou hast . DIG . Hobbin , ah Hobbin ! I curse the stound That ever I cast to have lorn this ground : Well-away the while I was so fond To leave the good , that I had in hond , In hope of better that was uncouth , So lost the dog the flesh in his mouth . My silly sheep ( ah ! silly sheep ! ) That here by there I whilome us 'd to keep , All were they lusty as thou didest see , Be all starved with pine and penury ; Hardly myself escaped thilk pain , Driven for need to come home again . HOB . Ah ! fon , now by thy loss art taught That seldom change the better brought : Content who lives with tried state , Need fear no change of frowning Fate ; But who will seek for unknown gain , Oft lives by loss , and leaves with pain . DIG . I wot ne , Hobbin , how I was bewitch 'd With vain desire and hope to be enrich 'd : But , sicker , so it is , as the bright star Seemeth aye greater when it is far : I thought the soil would have made me rich , But now I wot it is nothing sich ; For either the shepheards be idle and still , And led of their sheep what way they will , Or they be false , and full of covetise , And casten to compass many wrong emprise : But the more be fraught with fraud and spite , Ne in good nor goodness taken delight , But kindle coals of contest and ire , Wherewith they set all the world on fire ; Which when they thinken again to quench , With holy water they do them all drench . They say they con to heaven the highway , But by my soul I dare undersay They never set foot in that same troad , But balk the right way , and strayen abroad . They boast they have the devil at command , But ask them therefore what they have pawn 'd : Marry ! that great Pan bought with dear borrow , To quit it from the black bower of sorrow . But they have sold thilk same long ago , For they woulden draw with them many moe . But let them gang alone a God 's name ; As they have brewed , so let them bear blame . HOB . Diggon , I pray thee speak not so dirk ; Such mister saying me seemeth to mirk . DIG . Then , plainly to speak of shepheards ’ most what , Bad is the best ; ( this English is flat ) Their ill haviour gars men missay Both of their doctrine , and their fay . They sayn the world is much war than it wont , All for her shepheards be beastly and blont . Other sayn , but how truly I n'ote , All for they holden shame of their cote : Some stick not to say , ( hot coal on their tongue ! ) That such mischief graseth them among , All for they casten too much of world 's care , To deck their dame , and enrich their heir ; For such encheason , if you go nigh , Few chimneys reeking you shall espy . The fat ox , that wont lig in the stall , Is now fast stalled in their crumenall . Thus chatten the people in their steads , Alike as a monster of many heads : But they , that shooten nearest the prick , Sayn , other the fat from their beards doen lick : For big bulls of Bashan brace them about , That with their horns butten the more stout ; But the lean souls treaden under foot , And to seek redress might little boot ; For liker be they to pluck away more , Than ought of the gotten good to restore : For they be like foul quagmires overgrass 'd , That , if thy galage once sticketh fast , The more to wind it out thou dost swink , Thou must aye deeper and deeper sink . Yet better leave off with a little loss , Than by much wrestling to lose the gross . HOB . Now , Diggon , I see thou speakest too plain ; Better it were a little to feign , And cleanly cover that cannot be cured ; Such ill , as is forced , must needs be endured . But of such pastors how do the flocks creep ? DIG . Such as the shepheards , such be their sheep , For they nill listen to the shepheard 's voice ; But if he call them , at their good choice They wander at will and stay at pleasure , And to their folds yede at their own leisure . But they had be better come at their call ; For many have unto mischief fall , And been of ravenous wolves yrent , All for they nould be buxom and bent . HOB . Fie on thee , Diggon , and all thy foul leasing ; Well is known that , sith the Saxon king ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 15 ]</span>Never was wolf seen , many nor some , Nor in all Kent , nor in Christendom ; But the fewer wolves ( the sooth to sayn ) The more be the foxes that here remain . DIG . Yes , but they gang in more secret wise , And with sheeps ’ clothing doen them disguise . They walk not widely as they were wont , For fear of rangers and the great hunt , But privily prowling to and fro , Enaunter they might be inly know . HOB . Or privy or pert if any bin , We have great bandogs will tear their skin . DIG . Indeed thy Ball is a bold big cur , And could make a jolly hole in their fur : But not good dogs them needeth to chase , But heedy shepheards to discern their face ; For all their craft is in their countenance , They be so grave and full of maintenance . But shall I tell thee what myself know Chanced to Roffin not long ago ? HOB . Say it out , Diggon , whatever it hight , For not but well might him betight : He is so meek , wise , and merciable , And with his word his work is convenable . Colin Clout , I ween , be his self boy , ( Ah , for Colin ! he whilome my joy :) Shepheards such , God might us many send , That doen so carefully their flocks tend . DIG . Thilk same shepheard might I well mark , He has a dog to bite or to bark ; Never had shepheard so keen a cur , That waketh and if but a leaf stur . Whilome there wonned a wicked wolf , That with many a lamb had gutted his gulf , And ever at night wont to repair Unto the flock , when the welkin shone fair , Yclad in clothing of silly sheep , When the good old man used to sleep ; Then at midnight he would bark and bawl , ( For he had eft learned a currës call ,) As if a wolf were among the sheep : With that the shepheard would break his sleep , And send out Lowder ( for so his dog hote ) To range the fields with wide open throat . Then , when as Lowder was far away , This wolvish sheep would catchen his prey , A lamb , or a kid , or a weanel wast ; With that to the wood would he speed him fast . Long time he used this slippery prank , Ere Roffy could for his labour him thank . At end , the shepheard his practice spied , ( For Roffy is wise , and as Argus eyed ,) And , when at even he came to the flock , Fast in their folds he did them lock , And took out the wolf in his counterfeit coat , And let out the sheep 's blood at his throat . HOB . Marry , Diggon , what should him affray To take his own where ever it lay ? For , had his weasand been a little widder , He would have devoured both hidder and shidder . DIG . Mischief light on him , and God 's great curse , Too good for him had been a great deal worse ; For it was a perilous beast above all , And eke had he cond the shepheard 's call , And oft in the night came to the sheep-cote , And called Lowder , with a hollow throat , As if the old man self had been : The dog his master 's voice did it ween , Yet half in doubt he opened the door , And ran out as he was wont of yore . No sooner was out , but , swifter than thought , Fast by the hide the wolf Lowder caught ; And , had not Roffy run to the steven , Lowder had been slain thilk same even . HOB . God shield , man , he should so ill have thrive , All for he did his devoir belive . If such be wolves , as thou hast told , How might we , Diggon , them behold ? DIG . How , but , with heed and watchfulness , Forstallen them of their wiliness : Forthy with shepheard sits not play , Or sleep , as some doen , all the long day ; But ever liggen in watch and ward , From sudden force their flocks for to guard . HOB . Ah ! Diggon , thilk same rule were too strait , All the cold season to watch and wait : We be of flesh , men as other be , Why should we be bound to such misery ? Whatever thing lacketh changeable rest , Must needs decay , when it is at best . DIG . Ah ! but , Hobbinol , all this long tale Nought easeth the care that doth me forhaile ; What shall I do ? what way shall I wend , My piteous plight and loss to amend ? Ah ! good Hobbinol , might I thee pray Of aid or counsel in my decay ? HOB . Now by my soul , Diggon , I lament The hapless mischief that has thee hent ; Natheless thou seest my lowly sail , That froward Fortune doth ever availe : But , were Hobbinol as God might please , Diggon should soon find favour and ease : But if to my cottage thou wilt resort , So as I can I will thee comfort ; There mayst thou lig in a vetchy bed , Till fairer Fortune shew forth his head . DIG . Ah ! Hobbinol , God may it thee requite ; Diggon on few such friends did ever light .</p>

   <p>OCTOBER . ÆGLOGA DECIMA . ARGUMENT .</p>
   <p>In Cuddie is set out the perfect pattern of a Poet , which , finding no maintenance of his state and studies , complaineth of the contempt of Poetry , and the causes thereof : specially having been in all ages , and even amongst the most barbarous , always of singular account and honour , and being indeed so worthy and commendable an art ; or rather no art , but a divine gift and heavenly instinct not to be gotten by labour and learning , but adorned with both ; and poured into the wit by a certain Enthousiasmos and celestial inspiration , as the Author hereof elsewhere at large discourseth in his book called The English Poet , which book being lately come to my hands , I mind also by God 's grace , upon further advisement , to publish .</p>

   <p>COLIN 'S EMBLEME ]</p>
   <p>NOVEMBER . ÆGLOGA UNDECIMA . ARGUMENT .</p>
   <p>In this xi . Æglogue he bewaileth the death of some maiden of great blood , whom he calleth Dido . The personage is secret , and to me altogether unknown , albeit of himself I often required the same . This Æglogue is made in imitation of Marot his song , which he made upon the death of Loyes the French Queen ; but far passing his reach , and in mine opinion all other the Æglogues of this Book .</p>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>THENOT . COLIN .</head>
    <head>THENOT . Colin , my dear , when shall it please thee sing , As thou wert wont , songs of some jovisance ? Thy Muse too long slumb'reth in sorrowing , Lulled asleep through Love 's misgovernance . Now somewhat sing , whose endless sovenance Among the shepheards ’ swains may aye remain , Whether thee list thy loved lass advance , Or honour Pan with hymns of higher vein . COL. Thenot , now n'is the time of merrimake , Nor Pan to herie , nor with Love to play ; Such mirth in May is meetest for to make , Or summer shade , under the cocked hay . But now sad winter welked hath the day , And Phoebus , weary of his yearly task , Ystabled hath his steeds in lowly lay , And taken up his inn in Fishes '[ 18 ] hask : Thilk sullen season sadder plight doth ask , And loatheth such delights as thou dost praise : The mournful Muse in mirth now list ne mask , As she was wont in youth and summer-days ; But if thou algate lust light virelays , And looser songs of love to underfong , Who but thyself deserves such poets ’ praise ? Relieve thy oaten pipes that sleepen long . THE . The nightingale is sovereign of song , Before him sits the titmouse silent be ; And I , unfit to thrust in skilful throng , Should Colin make judge of my foolery . Nay , better learn of them that learned be , And have been watered at the Muses ’ well ; The kindly dew drops from the higher tree , And wets the little plants that lowly dwell : But if sad winter 's wrath , and season chill , Accord not with thy Muse 's merriment , To sadder times thou mayst attune thy quill , And sing of sorrow and death 's dreariment ; For dead is Dido ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 19 ]</span>dead , alas ! and drent , Dido ! the great shepheard his daughter sheen : The fairest may she was that ever went , Her like she has not left behind , I ween : And , if thou wilt bewail my woful teen , I shall thee give yond cosset for thy pain ; And , if thy rhymes as round and rueful been As those that did thy Rosalind complain , Much greater gifts for guerdon thou shalt gain . Than kid or cosset , which I thee benempt : Then up , I say , thou jolly shepheard swain , Let not my small demand be so contempt . COL. Thenot , to that I chose thou dost me tempt ; But ah ! too well I wot my humble vein , And how my rhymes be rugged and unkempt ; Yet , as I con , my conning I will strain .</head>

    <head>DECEMBER . ÆGLOGA DUODECIMA .<span type="note_anchor">[ 21 ]</span>ARGUMENT .</head>
    <head>This Æglogue ( even as the first began ) is ended with a complaint of Colin to god Pan ; wherein , as weary of his former ways , he proportioned his life to the four seasons of the year ; comparing his youth to the spring time , when he was fresh and free from love 's folly . His manhood to the summer , which , he saith , was consumed with great heat and excessive drouth , caused through a comet or blazing star , by which he meaneth love ; which passion is commonly compared to such flames and immoderate heat . His ripest years he resembleth to an unseasonable harvest , wherein the fruits fall ere they be ripe . His latter age to winter 's chill and frosty season , now drawing near to his last end .</head>

    <head>NOTES .</head>
    <p n="1">Page xviii , note 1 .— The name of the writer of this letter is unknown .</p>
    <p n="2">Page 5 , note 2 .— “ Hobbinol : ” the author 's friend Gabriel Harvey .</p>
    <p n="3">Page 10 , note 3 .— “ Good Friday : ” Good Friday is said to frown , as being a fast-day .</p>
    <p n="4">Page 16 , note 4 .— Thenot 's emblem means , in substance , that God , who is aged Himself , being without beginning of days , makes those whom He loves , to be aged , like Himself ; and that it is a mark of His favour to be old . Cuddie 's emblem is , “ No old man fears God ” — a sarcasm against Thenot .</p>
    <p n="5">Page 29 , note 5 .— “ Tawdry : ” is here used in its primitive sense , denoting something bought at the fair of St. Ethelred , or St. Awdrey .</p>
    <p n="6">Page 30 , note 6 .— “ This poesy is taken out of Virgil , and there of him used in the person of Æneas to his mother Venus , appearing to him in likeness of one of Diana 's damsels ; being there most divinely set forth . To which similitude of divinity Hobbinol comparing the excellency of Elisa , and being through the worthiness of Colin 's song , as it were , overcome with the hugeness of his imagination , bursteth out in great admiration , ( O quam te memorem virgo ! ) being otherwise unable , than by sudden silence , to express the worthiness of his conceit . Whom Thenot answereth with another part of the like verse , as confirming by his grant and approvance , that Elisa is no whit inferior to the majesty of her , of whom the poet so boldly pronounced , O dea certe ! ” — E. K .</p>
    <p n="7">Page 35 , note 7 .— “ Algrind : ” Archbishop Grindall .</p>
    <p n="8">Page 37 , note 8 .— “ Fox , ” “ Kid : ” “ By the Kid may be understood the simple sort of the faithful and true Christians ; by his dam , Christ , that hath already with careful watchwords ( as here doth the Goat ) warned her little ones to beware of such doubling deceit ; by the Fox , the false and faithless Papists , to whom is no credit to be given , nor fellowship to be used . ” — E. K .</p>
    <p n="9">Page 41 , note 9 .— “ Sir John : ” a name applied to a Popish priest .</p>

    <p n="13">Page 59 , note 13 .— “ An eagle : ” the same story is told of the death of Eschylus .</p>
    <p n="14">Pages 68 , 69 , note 14 .— “ The meaning hereof is very ambiguous : for Perigot by his posy claiming the conquest , and Willie not yielding , Cuddie the arbiter of their cause , and patron of his own , seemeth to challenge it , as his due , saying , that he is happy which can ; so abruptly ending ; but he meaneth either him , that can win the best , or moderate himself being best , and leave off with the best . ” — E. K .</p>
    <p n="15">Page 77 , note 15 .— “ Saxon king : ” King Edgar , in whose reign wolves are said to have disappeared in England .</p>
    <p n="16">Page 84 , note 16 .— “ Elisa : ” Queen Elizabeth ; the “ Worthy ” is the Earl of Leicester .</p>
    <p n="17">Page 87 , note 17 .— This emblem is portion of a Latin verse , expressing the thought of the pastoral , that poetry is a fervid glow of inspiration which animates and kindles .</p>
    <p n="18">Page 91 , note 18 .— “ Fishes : ” the sun enters the constellation Pisces in November .</p>
    <p n="19">Page 92 , note 19 .— “ Dido ” and “ great shepheard ” both refer to real persons unknown .</p>

    <p n="22">Page 107 , note 22 .— “ The pilgrim : ” perhaps the author of the “ Visions of Pierce Ploughman . ”</p>
