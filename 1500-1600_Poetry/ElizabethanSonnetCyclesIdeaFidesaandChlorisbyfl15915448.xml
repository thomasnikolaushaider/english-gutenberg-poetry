   <p>IDEA by MICHAEL DRAYTON</p>
   <p>The true story of the life of Michael Drayton might be told to vindicate the poetic traditions of the olden time . A child-poet wandering in fay-haunted Arden , or listening to the harper that frequented the fireside of Polesworth Hall where the boy was a petted page , later the honoured almoner of the bounty of many patrons , one who “ not unworthily , ” as Tofte said , “ beareth the name of the chiefest archangel , singing after this soule-ravishing manner , ” yet leaving but “ five pounds lying by him at his death , which was satis viatici ad coelum ” — is not this the panorama of a poetic career ? But above all , to complete the picture of the ideal poet , he worshipped , and hopelessly , from youth to age the image of one , woman . He never married , and while many patronesses were honoured with his poetic addresses , there was one fair dame to whom he never offered dedicatory sonnet , a silence that is full of meaning . Yet the praises of Idea , his poetic name for the lady of his admiration and love , are written all over the pages of his voluminous lyrical and chorographical and historical poems , and her very name is quaintly revealed to us . Anne Goodere was the younger daughter in the noble family where Drayton was bred and educated ; and one may picture the fair child standing “ gravely merry ” by the little page to listen to “ John Hews his lyre , ” at that ancestral fireside . “ Where I love , I love for years , ” said Drayton in 1621 . As late as 1627 , but four years before his death , he writes an elegy of his lady 's not coming to London , in which he complains that he has been starved for her short letters and has had to read last year 's over again . About the same time he is writing that immortal sonnet , the sixty-first , the one that Rossetti , with perhaps something too much of partiality , has declared to be almost , if not quite , the best in the language . The tragedy of a whole life is concentrated in that sonnet , and the heart-pang in it is unmistakable . But Drayton had stood as witness to the will of Anne 's father , by which £ 1500 was set down for her marriage portion . She was an heiress , he a penniless poet , and what was to be done ?</p>
   <p>About 1590 , when Drayton was twenty-eight , and Anne was probably twenty-one years old , Drayton left Polesworth Hall and came to London . Perhaps the very parting was the means of revealing his heart to himself , for it is from near this time that , as he confesses later , he dates the first consciousness of his love . He soon publishes Idea , the Shepherd 's Garland , Rowland 's Sacrifice to the Nine Muses , where we first see our poet , in his pastoral-poetic character , carving his “ rime of love 's idolatry , ” upon a beechen tree . Thirteen stanzas of these pastoral eclogues do not exhaust the catalogue of her beauties ; and when he praises the proportion of her shape and carriage , we know that it was not the poet 's frenzied eye alone that saw these graces , for Dr. John Hall , of Stratford , who attended her professionally , records in his case-book that she was “ beautiful and of gallant structure of body . ” Anne was married about 1595 to Sir Henry Rainsford , who became Drayton 's friend , host and patron . It is likely that Lady Rainsford deserved a goodly portion of the praises bestowed upon her beauty . And she need not have been ashamed of the devotion of her knight of poesy ; for Michael Drayton was , like Constable and Daniel and Fletcher , a man good and true , and the chorus of contemporaries that praise his character and his verse is led by pious Meres himself , and echoed by Jonson .</p>
   <p>Idea 's Mirrour , Amours in Quatorzains , formed the title under which the sonnet-cycle appeared in 1594 . Idea was reprinted eight times before 1637 , the edition of 1619 being the chief and serving for the foundation of our text . Many changes and additions were made by the author in the successive editions ; in fact only twenty of the fifty-one “ amours ” in Idea 's Mirrour escaped the winnowing , while the famous sixty-first appears for the first time in 1619 . There is a distinct progress manifest in the subdual of language and form to artistic finish , and while the cycle in its unevenness represents the early and late stages of poetic progress , the more delicate examples of his work show him worthy of the praise bestowed by his latest admirer and critic ,</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Faith , Michael Drayton bears the bell</l>
     <l n="2">For numbers airy . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>It will be noted that , while many rhyme-arrangements are experimented upon , the Shakespearean or quatrain-and-couplet form predominates . In the less praiseworthy sonnets he is found to lack grammatical clamping and to allow frequent faults in rhythm , and he toys with the glittering and soulless conceit as much as any ; but where his individuality has fullest sway , as in the picturesque Arden memory of the fifty-third , the personal reminiscences of the Ankor sonnets , and the vivid theatre theme of the forty-seventh , in what Main calls that “ magical realisation of the spirit of evening ” in the thirty-seventh , and above all in the naïve and passionate sixty-first , there is a rude strength that pierces beneath the formalities and touches and moves the heart . Drayton , like Sidney and Daniel and Shakespeare , draws freely upon the general thought-storehouse of the Italianate sonneteers : time and the transitoriness of beauty , the lover 's extremes , the Platonic ideas of soul-functions and of love-madness , the phoenix and Icarus and all the classic gods , engage his fancy first or last ; and no sonnet trifler has been more attracted by the great theme of immortality in verse than he . When honouring Idea in the favourite mode he cries</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Queens hereafter shall be glad to live</l>
     <l n="2">Upon the alms of thy superfluous praise . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>A late writer holds that years have falsified this prophecy . It is true that Lamb valued Drayton chiefly as the panegyrist of his native earth , and we would hardly venture to predict the future of our sonneteer ; but the fact remains that now three hundred years after his time , his lifelong devotion to the prototype of Idea constitutes , as he conventionally asserted it would , his most valid claim to interest , and that the sonnets where this love has found most potent expression mount the nearest to the true note of immortality .</p>

    <head>TO THE READER OF THESE SONNETS</head>
     <l n="1">Into these loves who but for passion looks ,</l>
     <l n="2">At this first sight here let him lay them by ,</l>
     <l n="3">And seek elsewhere in turning other books ,</l>
     <l n="4">Which better may his labour satisfy .</l>
     <l n="5">No far-fetched sigh shall ever wound my breast ;</l>
     <l n="6">Love from mine eye a tear shall never wring ;</l>
     <l n="7">Nor in “ Ah me 's ! ” my whining sonnets drest ,</l>
     <l n="8">A libertine fantasticly I sing .</l>
     <l n="9">My verse is the true image of my mind ,</l>
     <l n="10">Ever in motion , still desiring change ;</l>
     <l n="11">To choice of all variety inclined ,</l>
     <l n="12">And in all humours sportively I range .</l>
     <l n="13">My muse is rightly of the English strain ,</l>
     <l n="14">That cannot long one fashion entertain .</l>

   <p>FIDESSA MORE CHASTE THAN KIND by B. GRIFFIN , GENT .</p>
   <p>BARTHOLOMEW GRIFFIN</p>
   <p>The author of Fidessa has gained undeserved notice from the fact that the piratical printer W. Jaggard , included a transcript of one of his sonnets in a volume that he put forth in 1599 , under the name of Shakespeare . It would be easy to believe , in spite of the doubtful rimes characteristic of Fidessa , that sonnet three was not Griffin 's , for no singer in the Elizabethan choir was more skilful in turning his voice to other people 's melodies than was he . He has been called “ a gross plagiary ; ” yet it must be realised that the sonneteers of that time felt they had a right , almost a duty , to take up the poetic themes used by their models . Griffin shows great ingenuity in the manipulation of the stock-themes , and the lover of Petrarch and all the young Abraham-Slenders of the day must have been delighted with the familiar “ designs ” as they re-appeared in Fidessa .</p>
   <p>Bartholomew Griffin was buried in Coventry in 1602 . In 1596 he dedicated his “ slender work ” Fidessa to William Essex of Lamebourne in Berkshire . He adds an address to the Gentlemen of the Inns of Court , whom he begs to “ censure mildly as protectors of a poor stranger ” and “ judge the best as encouragers of a young beginner . ” Of the poet little further is known . From the sonnets themselves we learn that Fidessa was “ of high regard , ” the child of a beautiful mother and of a renowned father ; she sprang in fact from the same root with the poet himself , who writes “ Gent . ” after his name on the title-page . She had been kind to him in sickness and had “ yielded to each look of his a sweet reply . ” After giving these slight hints , he pushes forth from the moorings of realism and sets sail on the ocean of the sonneteer 's fancy , meeting the usual adventures . His sonnets , while showing versatility and ingenuity , lack spontaneous feeling and have serious defects in form ; yet these defects are in part offset by their conversational ease and dramatic vividness .</p>

   <note>Talis apud tales , talis sub tempore tali : Subque meo tali judice , talis ero . CHLORIS OR , THE COMPLAINT OF THE PASSIONATE DESPISED SHEPHERD by WILLIAM SMITH WILLIAM SMITH The sub-title of Chloris arouses an expectation that is gratified in the pastoral modishness of the sonnets . Corin sits under the “ lofty pines , co-partners of his woe , ” with oaten reed at his lips , and calls on sylvans , lambkins and all Parnassans to testify to the beauty and cruelty of Chloris . The attitude is a self-conscious one , yet the poem reveals little of the personality of the author beyond the facts of his youthfulness and of his devotion to “ the most excellent and learned Shepheard , Colin Cloute . ” It was in 1595 , but one year before the publication of Chloris , that Spenser had sung his own sonnets of true love , and it is perhaps on this account that William Smith finds him in a mood favourable to the defence of a young aspirant . At any rate , the language of the dedication rings with something more than mere desire for distinguished patronage . The youth looks with a beautiful humility upward toward the greater but “ dear and most entire beloved ” poet . His own sonnets , he says , are “ of my study the budding springs ” ; they are but “ young-hatched orphan things . ” He nowhere boasts that they will give immortal renown to the scornful beauty , but modestly promises that if her cruel disdain does not ruin him , the time shall come when he “ more large ” her “ praises forth shall pen . ” Chloris had once been favourable , as sonnet forty-eight distinctly shows , but the cycle does not bring any happy conclusion to the story . Corin is left weeping but faithful , and the picture of Chloris is composed of such faint outlines only as the sonneteer 's conventions can delineate . Beyond this no certain information in regard to poet or honoured lady has yet been unearthed . For all its formality , however , the sonnet-cycle is not wanting in touches of real feeling and lines of musical sweetness ; the writer shows considerable skill in the management of rime , and in structure he adopts the form preferred by Shakespeare , whose “ sugared sonnets ” may by this date have passed beneath his eye . The melodies piped by other sonnet-shepherds re-echo with a great deal of distinctness in Covin 's strains ; nevertheless he has himself taken a draught from the true Elizabethan fount of lyric inspiration , and the nymph Chloris with her heart-robbing eye well deserves a place on the snow-soft downs where the sonneteering shepherds were wont to assemble .</note>
   <div type="dedication">
    <p>TO THE MOST EXCELLENT AND LEARNED SHEPHERD COLIN CLOUT I Colin my dear and most entire beloved , My muse audacious stoops her pitch to thee , Desiring that thy patience be not moved By these rude lines , written here you see ; Fain would my muse whom cruel love hath wronged , Shroud her love labours under thy protection , And I myself with ardent zeal have longed That thou mightst know to thee my true affection . Therefore , good Colin , graciously accept A few sad sonnets which my muse hath framed ; Though they but newly from the shell are crept , Suffer them not by envy to be blamed , But underneath the shadow of thy wings Give warmth to these young-hatchèd orphan things . II Give warmth to these young-hatchèd orphan things , Which chill with cold to thee for succour creep ; They of my study are the budding springs ; Longer I cannot them in silence keep . They will be gadding sore against my mind . But courteous shepherd , if they run astray , Conduct them that they may the pathway find , And teach them how the mean observe they may . Thou shalt them ken by their discording notes , Their weeds are plain , such as poor shepherds wear ; Unshapen , torn , and ragged are their coats , Yet forth they wand'ring are devoid of fear . They which have tasted of the muses ’ spring , I hope will smile upon the tunes they sing . TO ALL SHEPHERDS IN GENERAL You whom the world admires for rarest style , You which have sung the sonnets of true love , Upon my maiden verse with favour smile , Whose weak-penned muse to fly too soon doth prove ; Before her feathers have their full perfection , She soars aloft , pricked on by blind affection . You whose deep wits , ingine , and industry , The everlasting palm of praise have won , You paragons of learnèd poesy , Favour these mists , which fall before your sun , Intentions leading to a more effect If you them grace but with your mild aspect . And thou the Genius of my ill-tuned note , Whose beauty urgèd hath my rustic vein Through mighty oceans of despair to float , That I in rime thy cruelty complain : Vouchsafe to read these lines both harsh and bad Nuntiates of woe with sorrow being clad . CHLORIS I Courteous Calliope , vouchsafe to lend Thy helping hand to my untunèd song , And grace these lines which I to write pretend , Compelled by love which doth poor Corin wrong . And those thy sacred sisters I beseech , Which on Parnassus ’ mount do ever dwell , To shield my country muse and rural speech By their divine authority and spell . Lastly to thee , O Pan , the shepherds ’ king , And you swift-footed Dryades I call ; Attend to hear a swain in verse to sing Sonnets of her that keeps his heart in thrall ! O Chloris , weigh the task I undertake ! Thy beauty subject of my song I make . II Thy beauty subject of my song I make , O fairest fair , on whom depends my life ! Refuse not then the task I undertake , To please thy rage and to appease my strife ; But with one smile remunerate my toil , None other guerdon I of thee desire . Give not my lowly muse new-hatched the foil , But warmth that she may at the length aspire Unto the temples of thy star-bright eyes , Upon whose round orbs perfect beauty sits , From whence such glorious crystal beams arise , As best my Chloris ’ seemly face befits ; Which eyes , which beauty , which bright crystal beam , Which face of thine hath made my love extreme . III Feed , silly sheep , although your keeper pineth , Yet like to Tantalus doth see his food . Skip you and leap , no bright Apollo shineth , Whilst I bewail my sorrows in yon wood , Where woeful Philomela doth record , And sings with notes of sad and dire lament The tragedy wrought by her sisters ’ lord ; I 'll bear a part in her black discontent . That pipe which erst was wont to make you glee Upon these downs whereon you careless graze , Shall to her mournful music tunèd be . Let not my plaints , poor lambkins , you amaze ; There underneath that dark and dusky bower , Whole showers of tears to Chloris I will pour . IV Whole showers of tears to Chloris I will pour , As true oblations of my sincere love , If that will not suffice , most fairest flower , Then shall my sighs thee unto pity move . If neither tears nor sighs can aught prevail , My streaming blood thine anger shall appease , This hand of mine by vigour shall assail To tear my heart asunder thee to please . Celestial powers on you I invocate ; You know the chaste affections of my mind , I never did my faith yet violate ; Why should my Chloris then be so unkind ? That neither tears , nor sighs , nor streaming blood , Can unto mercy move her cruel mood . V You fawns and silvans , when my Chloris brings Her flocks to water in your pleasant plains , Solicit her to pity Corin 's strings , The smart whereof for her he still sustains . For she is ruthless of my woeful song ; My oaten reed she not delights to hear . O Chloris , Chloris ! Corin thou dost wrong , Who loves thee better than his own heart dear . The flames of Aetna are not half so hot As is the fire which thy disdain hath bread . Ah cruel fates , why do you then besot Poor Corin 's soul with love , when love is fled ? Either cause cruel Chloris to relent , Or let me die upon the wound she sent ! VI You lofty pines , co-partners of my woe , When Chloris sitteth underneath your shade , To her those sighs and tears I pray you show , Whilst you attending I for her have made . Whilst you attending , droppèd have sweet balm In token that you pity my distress , Zephirus hath your stately boughs made calm . Whilst I to you my sorrows did express , The neighbour mountains bended have their tops , When they have heard my rueful melody , And elves in rings about me leaps and hops , To frame my passions to their jollity . Resounding echoes from their obscure caves , Reiterate what most my fancy craves . VII What need I mourn , seeing Pan our sacred king Was of that nymph fair Syrinx coy disdained ? The world 's great light which comforteth each thing , All comfortless for Daphne 's sake remained . If gods can find no help to heal the sore Made by love 's shafts , which pointed are with fire , Unhappy Corin , then thy chance deplore , Sith they despair by wanting their desire . I am not Pan though I a shepherd be , Yet is my love as fair as Syrinx was . My songs cannot with Phoebus ’ tunes agree , Yet Chloris ’ doth his Daphne 's far surpass . How much more fair by so much more unkind , Than Syrinx coy , or Daphne , I her find ! VIII No sooner had fair Phoebus trimmed his car , Being newly risen from Aurora 's bed , But I in whom despair and hope did war , My unpenned flock unto the mountains led . Tripping upon the snow-soft downs I spied Three nymphs more fairer than those beautys three Which did appear to Paris on mount Ide . Coming more near , my goddess I there see ; For she the field-nymphs oftentimes doth haunt , To hunt with them the fierce and savage boar ; And having sported virelays they chaunt , Whilst I unhappy helpless cares deplore . There did I call to her , ah too unkind ! But tiger-like , of me she had no mind . IX Unto the fountain where fair Delia chaste The proud Acteon turnèd to a hart , I drove my flock , that water sweet to taste , ‘ Cause from the welkin Phoebus ‘ gan depart . There did I see the nymph whom I admire , Rememb'ring her locks , of which the yellow hue Made blush the beauties of her curlèd wire , Which Jove himself with wonder well might view ; Then red with ire , her tresses she berent , And weeping hid the beauty of her face , Whilst I amazèd at her discontent , With tears and sighs do humbly sue for grace ; But she regarding neither tears nor moan , Flies from the fountain leaving me alone . X Am I a Gorgon that she doth me fly , Or was I hatchèd in the river Nile ? Or doth my Chloris stand in doubt that I With syren songs do seek her to beguile ? If any one of these she can object ‘ Gainst me , which chaste affected love protest , Then might my fortunes by her frowns be checked , And blameless she from scandal free might rest . But seeing I am no hideous monster born , But have that shape which other men do bear , Which form great Jupiter did never scorn , Amongst his subjects here on earth to wear , Why should she then that soul with sorrow fill , Which vowèd hath to love and serve her still ? XI Tell me , my dear , what moves thy ruthless mind To be so cruel , seeing thou art so fair ? Did nature frame thy beauty so unkind ? Or dost thou scorn to pity my despair ? O no , it was not nature 's ornament , But wingèd love 's unpartial cruel wound , Which in my heart is ever permanent , Until my Chloris make me whole and sound . O glorious love-god , think on my heart 's grief ; Let not thy vassal pine through deep disdain ; By wounding Chloris I shall find relief , If thou impart to her some of my pain . She doth thy temples and thy shrines abject ; They with Amintas ’ flowers by me are decked . XII Cease , eyes , to weep sith none bemoans your weeping ; Leave off , good muse , to sound the cruel name Of my love 's queen which hath my heart in keeping , Yet of my love doth make a jesting game ! Long hath my sufferance laboured to inforce One pearl of pity from her pretty eyes , Whilst I with restless oceans of remorse Bedew the banks where my fair Chloris lies , Where my fair Chloris bathes her tender skin , And doth triumph to see such rivers fall From those moist springs , which never dry have been Since she their honour hath detained in thrall ; And still she scorns one favouring smile to show Unto those waves proceeding from my woe . XIII A Dream What time fair Titan in the zenith sat , And equally the fixèd poles did heat , When to my flock my daily woes I chat , And underneath a broad beech took my seat , The dreaming god which Morpheus poets call , Augmenting fuel to my Aetna 's fire , With sleep possessing my weak senses all , In apparitions makes my hopes aspire . Methought I saw the nymph I would imbrace , With arms abroad coming to me for help , A lust-led satyr having her in chase Which after her about the fields did yelp . I seeing my love in perplexèd plight , A sturdy bat from off an oak I reft , And with the ravisher continue fight Till breathless I upon the earth him left . Then when my coy nymph saw her breathless foe , With kisses kind she gratifies my pain , Protesting never rigour more to show . Happy was I this good hap to obtain ; But drowsy slumbers flying to their cell , My sudden joy converted was to bale ; My wonted sorrows still with me do dwell . I lookèd round about on hill and dale , But I could neither my fair Chloris view , Nor yet the satyr which erstwhile I slew . XIV Mournful Amintas , thou didst pine with care , Because the fates by their untimely doom Of life bereft thy loving Phillis fair , When thy love 's spring did first begin to bloom . My care doth countervail that care of thine , And yet my Chloris draws her angry breath ; My hopes still hoping hopeless now repine , For living she doth add to me but death . Thy Phinis , dying , lovèd thee full dear ; My Chloris , living , hates poor Corin 's love , Thus doth my woe as great as thine appear , Though sundry accents both our sorrows move . Thy swan-like songs did show thy dying anguish ; These weeping truce-men show I living languish . XV These weeping truce-men show I living languish , My woeful wailings tells my discontent ; Yet Chloris nought esteemeth of mine anguish , My thrilling throbs her heart cannot relent . My kids to hear the rimes and roundelays Which I on wasteful hills was wont to sing , Did more delight the lark in summer days , Whose echo made the neighbour groves to ring . But now my flock all drooping bleats and cries , Because my pipe , the author of their sport , All rent and torn and unrespected lies ; Their lamentations do my cares consort . They cease to feed and listen to the plaint Which I pour forth unto a cruel saint . XVI Which I pour forth unto a cruel saint , Who merciless my prayers doth attend , Who tiger-like doth pity my complaint , And never ear unto my woes will lend ! But still false hope dispairing life deludes , And tells my fancy I shall grace obtain ; But Chloris fair my orisons concludes With fearful frowns , presagers of my pain . Thus do I spend the weary wand'ring day , Oppressèd with a chaos of heart 's grief ; Thus I consume the obscure night away , Neglecting sleep which brings all cares relief ; Thus do I pass my ling'ring life in woe ; But when my bliss will come I do not know . XVII The perils which Leander took in hand Fair Hero 's love and favour to obtain , When void of fear securely leaving land , Through Hellespont he swam to Cestos ’ main , His dangers should not counterpoise my toil , If my dear love would once but pity show , To quench these flames which in my breast do broil , Or dry these springs which from mine eyes do flow . Not only Hellespont but ocean seas , For her sweet sake to ford I would attempt , So that my travels would her ire appease , My soul from thrall and languish to exempt . O what is't not poor I would undertake , If labour could my peace with Chloris make ! XVIII My love , I cannot thy rare beauties place Under those forms which many writers use : Some like to stones compare their mistress ’ face ; Some in the name of flowers do love abuse ; Some makes their love a goldsmith 's shop to be , Where orient pearls and precious stones abound ; In my conceit these far do disagree The perfect praise of beauty forth to sound . O Chloris , thou dost imitate thyself , Self 's imitating passeth precious stones , Or all the eastern Indian golden pelf ; Thy red and white with purest fair atones ; Matchless for beauty nature hath thee framed , Only unkind and cruel thou art named ! XIX The hound by eating grass doth find relief , For being sick it is his choicest meat ; The wounded hart doth ease his pain and grief If he the herb dictamion may eat ; The loathsome snake renews his sight again , When he casts off his withered coat and hue ; The sky-bred eagle fresh age doth obtain When he his beak decayed doth renew . I worse than these whose sore no salve can cure , Whose grief no herb nor plant nor tree can ease ; Remediless , I still must pain endure , Till I my Chloris ’ furious mood can please ; She like the scorpion gave to me a wound , And like the scorpion she must make me sound . XX Ye wasteful woods , bear witness of my woe , Wherein my plaints did oftentimes abound ; Ye careless birds my sorrows well do know , They in your songs were wont to make a sound ! Thou pleasant spring canst record likewise bear Of my designs and sad disparagement , When thy transparent billows mingled were With those downfalls which from mine eyes were sent ! The echo of my still-lamenting cries , From hollow vaults in treble voice resoundeth , And then into the empty air it flies , And back again from whence it came reboundeth . That nymph unto my clamors doth reply , Being likewise scorned in love as well as I. XXI Being likewise scorned in love as well as I By that self-loving boy , which did disdain To hear her after him for love to cry , For which in dens obscure she doth remain ; Yet doth she answer to each speech and voice , And renders back the last of what we speak , But specially , if she might have her choice , She of unkindness would her talk forth break . She loves to hear of love 's most sacred name , Although , poor nymph , in love she was despised ; And ever since she hides her head for shame , That her true meaning was so lightly prised ; She pitying me , part of my woes doth bear , As you , good shepherds , listening now shall hear . XXII O fairest fair , to thee I make my plaint , ( my plaint ) To thee from whom my cause of grief doth spring ; ( doth spring ) Attentive be unto the groans , sweet saint , ( sweet saint ) Which unto thee in doleful tunes I sing . ( I sing ) My mournful muse doth always speak of thee ; ( of thee ) My love is pure , O do it not disdain ! ( disdain ) With bitter sorrow still oppress not me , ( not me ) But mildly look upon me which complain . ( which complain ) Kill not my true-affecting thoughts , but give ( but give ) Such precious balm of comfort to my heart , ( my heart ) That casting off despair in hope to live , ( hope to live ) I may find help at length to ease my smart . ( to ease my smart ) So shall you add such courage to my love , ( my love ) That fortune false my faith shall not remove . ( shall not remove ) XXIII The phoenix fair which rich Arabia breeds , When wasting time expires her tragedy , No more on Phoebus ’ radiant rays she feeds , But heapeth up great store of spicery ; And on a lofty towering cedar tree , With heavenly substance she herself consumes , From whence she young again appears to be , Out of the cinders of her peerless plumes . So I which long have frièd in love 's flame , The fire not made of spice but sighs and tears , Revive again in hope disdain to shame , And put to flight the author of my fears . Her eyes revive decaying life in me , Though they augmenters of my thraldom be . XXIV Though they augmenters of my thraldom be , For her I live and her I love and none else ; O then , fair eyes , look mildly upon me , Who poor , despised , forlorn must live alone else , And like Amintas haunt the desert cells , And moanless there breathe out thy cruelty , Where none but care and melancholy dwells . I for revenge to Nemesis will cry ; If that will not prevail , my wandering ghost , Which breathless here this love-scorched trunk shall leave , Shall unto thee with tragic tidings post , How thy disdain did life from soul bereave . Then all too late my death thou wilt repent , When murther 's guilt thy conscience shall torment . XXV Who doth not know that love is triumphant , Sitting upon the throne of majesty ? The gods themselves his cruel darts do daunt , And he , blind boy , smiles at their misery . Love made great Jove ofttimes transform his shape ; Love made the fierce Alcides stoop at last ; Achilles , stout and bold , could not escape The direful doom which love upon him cast ; Love made Leander pass the dreadful flood Which Cestos from Abydos doth divide ; Love made a chaos where proud Ilion stood , Through love the Carthaginian Dido died . Thus may we see how love doth rule and reigns , Bringing those under which his power disdains . XXVI Though you be fair and beautiful withal , And I am black for which you me despise , Know that your beauty subject is to fall , Though you esteem it at so high a price . And time may come when that whereof you boast , Which is your youth 's chief wealth and ornament , Shall withered be by winter 's raging frost , When beauty 's pride and flowering years are spent . Then wilt thou mourn when none shall thee respect ; Then wilt thou think how thou hast scorned my tears ; Then pitiless each one will thee neglect , When hoary grey shall dye thy yellow hairs ; Then wilt thou think upon poor Corin 's case , Who loved thee dear , yet lived in thy disgrace . XXVII O Love , leave off with sorrow to torment me ; Let my heart 's grief and pining pain content thee ! The breach is made , I give thee leave to enter ; Thee to resist , great god , I dare not venter ! Restless desire doth aggravate mine anguish , Careful conceits do fill my soul with languish . Be not too cruel in thy conquest gained , Thy deadly shafts hath victory obtained ; Batter no more my fort with fierce affection , But shield me captive under thy protection . I yield to thee , O Love , thou art the stronger , Raise then thy siege and trouble me no longer ! XXVIII What cruel star or fate had domination When I was born , that thus my love is crossed ? Or from what planet had I derivation That thus my life in seas of woe is crossed ? Doth any live that ever had such hap That all their actions are of none effect , Whom fortune never dandled in her lap But as an abject still doth me reject ? Ah tickle dame ! and yet thou constant art My daily grief and anguish to increase , And to augment the troubles of my heart Thou of these bonds wilt never me release ; So that thy darlings me to be may know The true idea of all worldly woe . XXIX Some in their hearts their mistress ’ colours bears ; Some hath her gloves , some other hath her garters , Some in a bracelet wears her golden hairs , And some with kisses seal their loving charters . But I which never favour reapèd yet , Nor had one pleasant look from her fair brow , Content myself in silent shade to sit In hope at length my cares to overplow . Meanwhile mine eyes shall feed on her fair face , My sighs shall tell to her my sad designs , My painful pen shall ever sue for grace To help my heart , which languishing now pines ; And I will triumph still amidst my woe Till mercy shall my sorrows overflow . XXX The raging sea within his limits lies And with an ebb his flowing doth discharge ; The rivers when beyond their bounds they rise , Themselves do empty in the ocean large ; But my love 's sea which never limit keepeth , Which never ebbs but always ever floweth , In liquid salt unto my Chloris weepeth , Yet frustrate are the tears which he bestoweth . This sea which first was but a little spring Is now so great and far beyond all reason , That it a deluge to my thoughts doth bring , Which overwhelmed hath my joying season . So hard and dry is my saint 's cruel mind , These waves no way in her to sink can find . XXXI These waves no way in her to sink can find To penetrate the pith of contemplation ; These tears cannot dissolve her hardened mind , Nor move her heart on me to take compassion ; O then , poor Corin , scorned and quite despised , Loathe now to live since life procures thy woe ; Enough , thou hast thy heart anatomised , For her sweet sake which will no pity show ; But as cold winter 's storms and nipping frost Can never change sweet Aramanthus ’ hue , So though my love and life by her are crossed . My heart shall still be constant firm and true . Although Erynnis hinders Hymen 's rites , My fixèd faith against oblivion fights . XXXII My fixèd faith against oblivion fights , And I cannot forget her , pretty elf , Although she cruel be unto my plights ; Yet let me rather clean forget myself , Then her sweet name out of my mind should go , Which is th ’ elixir of my pining soul , From whence the essence of my life doth flow , Whose beauty rare my senses all control ; Themselves most happy evermore accounting , That such a nymph is queen of their affection , With ravished rage they to the skies are mounting , Esteeming not their thraldom nor subjection ; But still do joy amidst their misery , With patience bearing love 's captivity . XXXIII With patience bearing love 's captivity , Themselves unguilty of his wrath alleging ; These homely lines , abjects of poesy , For liberty and for their ransom pledging , And being free they solemnly do vow , Under his banner ever arms to bear Against those rebels which do disallow That love of bliss should be the sovereign heir ; And Chloris if these weeping truce-men may One spark of pity from thine eyes obtain , In recompense of their sad heavy lay , Poor Corin shall thy faithful friend remain ; And what I say I ever will approve , No joy may be comparèd to thy love ! XXXIV The bird of Thrace which doth bewail her rape , And murthered Itys eaten by his sire , When she her woes in doleful tunes doth shape , She sets her breast against a thorny briar ; Because care-charmer sleep should not disturb The tragic tale which to the night she tells , She doth her rest and quietness thus curb Amongst the groves where secret silence dwells : Even so I wake , and waking wail all night ; Chloris ’ unkindness slumbers doth expel ; I need not thorn 's sweet sleep to put to flight , Her cruelty my golden rest doth quell , That day and night to me are always one , Consumed in woe , in tears , in sighs and moan . XXXV Like to the shipman in his brittle boat . Tossèd aloft by the unconstant wind , By dangerous rocks and whirling gulfs doth float , Hoping at length the wishèd port to find ; So doth my love in stormy billows sail , And passeth the gaping Scilla 's waves , In hope at length with Chloris to prevail And win that prize which most my fancy craves , Which unto me of value will be more Then was that rich and wealthy golden fleece . Which Jason stout from Colchos ’ island bore With wind in sails unto the shore of Greece . More rich , more rare , more worth her love I prize Then all the wealth which under heaven lies . XXXVI O what a wound and what a deadly stroke , Doth Cupid give to us perplexèd lovers , Which cleaves more fast then ivy doth to oak , Unto our hearts where he his might discovers ! Though warlike Mars were armèd at all points , With that tried coat which fiery Vulcan made , Love 's shafts did penetrate his steelèd joints , And in his breast in streaming gore did wade . So pitiless is this fell conqueror That in his mother 's paps his arrows stuck ; Such is his rage that he doth not defer To wound those orbs from whence he life did suck . Then sith no mercy he shows to his mother , We meekly must his force and rigour smother . XXXVII Each beast in field doth wish the morning light ; The birds to Hesper pleasant lays do sing ; The wanton kids well-fed rejoice in night , Being likewise glad when day begins to spring . But night nor day are welcome unto me , Both can bear witness of my lamentation ; All day sad sighing Corin you shall see , All night he spends in tears and exclamation . Thus still I live although I take no rest , But living look as one that is a-dying ; Thus my sad soul with care and grief oppressed , Seems as a ghost to Styx and Lethe flying . Thus hath fond love bereft my youthful years Of all good hap before old age appears . XXXVIII That day wherein mine eyes cannot her see , Which is the essence of their crystal sight , Both blind , obscure and dim that day they be , And are debarrèd of fair heaven 's light ; That day wherein mine ears do want to hear her , Hearing that day is from me quite bereft ; That day wherein to touch I come not near her , That day no sense of touching I have left ; That day wherein I lack the fragrant smell , Which from her pleasant amber breath proceedeth , Smelling that day disdains with me to dwell , Only weak hope my pining carcase feedeth . But burst , poor heart , thou hast no better hope , Since all thy senses have no further scope ! XXXIX The stately lion and the furious bear The skill of man doth alter from their kind ; For where before they wild and savage were , By art both tame and meek you shall them find . The elephant although a mighty beast , A man may rule according to his skill ; The lusty horse obeyeth our behest , For with the curb you may him guide at will . Although the flint most hard contains the fire , By force we do his virtue soon obtain , For with a steel you shall have your desire , Thus man may all things by industry gain ; Only a woman if she list not love , No art , nor force , can unto pity move . XL No art nor force can unto pity move Her stony heart that makes my heart to pant ; No pleading passions of my extreme love Can mollify her mind of adamant . Ah cruel sex , and foe to all mankind , Either you love or else you hate too much ! A glist'ring show of gold in you we find , And yet you prove but copper in the touch . But why , O why , do I so far digress ? Nature you made of pure and fairest mould , The pomp and glory of man to depress , And as your slaves in thraldom them to hold ; Which by experience now too well I prove , There is no pain unto the pains of love . XLI Fair shepherdess , when as these rustic lines Comes to thy sight , weigh but with what affection Thy servile doth depaint his sad designs , Which to redress of thee he makes election . If so you scorn , you kill ; if you seem coy , You wound poor Corin to the very heart ; If that you smile , you shall increase his joy ; If these you like , you banish do all smart . And this I do protest , most fairest fair , My muse shall never cease that hill to climb , To which the learnèd Muses do repair , And all to deify thy name in rime ; And never none shall write with truer mind , As by all proof and trial you shall find . XLII Die , die , my hopes ! for you do but augment The burning accents of my deep despair ; Disdain and scorn your downfall do consent ; Tell to the world she is unkind yet fair ! O eyes , close up those ever-running fountains , For pitiless are all the tears you shed Wherewith you watered have both dales and mountains ! I see , I see , remorse from her is fled . Pack hence , ye sighs , into the empty air , Into the air that none your sound may hear , Sith cruel Chloris hath of you no care , Although she once esteemèd you full dear ! Let sable night all your disgraces cover , Yet truer sighs were never sighed by lover . XLIII Thou glorious sun , from whence my lesser light The substance of his crystal shine doth borrow , Let these my moans find favour in thy sight . And with remorse extinguish now my sorrow ! Renew those lamps which thy disdain hath quenched , As Phoebus doth his sister Phoebe 's shine ; Consider how thy Corin being drenched In seas of woe , to thee his plaints incline , And at thy feet with tears doth sue for grace , Which art the goddess of his chaste desire ; Let not thy frowns these labours poor deface Although aloft they at the first aspire ; And time shall come as yet unknown to men When I more large thy praises forth shall pen ! XLIV When I more large thy praises forth shall show , That all the world thy beauty shall admire , Desiring that most sacred nymph to know Which hath the shepherd 's fancy set on fire ; Till then , my dear , let these thine eyes content , Till then , fair love , think if I merit favour , Till then , O let thy merciful assent Relish my hopes with some comforting savour ; So shall you add such courage to my muse That she shall climb the steep Parnassus hill , That learnèd poets shall my deeds peruse When I from thence obtainèd have more skill ; And what I sing shall always be of thee As long as life or breath remains in me ! XLV When she was born whom I entirely love , Th ’ immortal gods her birth-rites forth to grace , Descending from their glorious seat above , They did on her these several virtues place : First Saturn gave to her sobriety , Jove then induèd her with comeliness , And Sol with wisdom did her beautify , Mercury with wit and knowledge did her bless , Venus with beauty did all parts bedeck , Luna therewith did modesty combine , Diana chaste all loose desires did check , And like a lamp in clearness she doth shine . But Mars , according to his stubborn kind , No virtue gave , but a disdainful mind . XLVI When Chloris first with her heart-robbing eye Inchanted had my silly senses all , I little did respect love 's cruelty , I never thought his snares should me enthrall ; But since her tresses have entangled me , My pining flock did never hear me sing Those jolly notes which erst did make them glee , Nor do my kids about me leap and spring As they were wont , but when they hear me cry They likewise cry and fill the air with bleating ; Then do my sheep upon the cold earth lie , And feed no more , my griefs they are repeating . O Chloris , if thou then saw'st them and me I 'm sure thou wouldst both pity them and me ! XLVII I need not tell thee of the lily white , Nor of the roseate red which doth thee grace , Nor of thy golden hairs like Phoebus bright , Nor of the beauty of thy fairest face . Nor of thine eyes which heavenly stars excel , Nor of thine azured veins which are so clear , Nor of thy paps where Love himself doth dwell , Which like two hills of violets appear . Nor of thy tender sides , nor belly soft , Nor of thy goodly thighs as white as snow , Whose glory to my fancy seemeth oft That like an arch triumphal they do show . All these I know that thou dost know too well , But of thy heart too cruel I thee tell . XLVIII But of thy heart too cruel I thee tell , Which hath tormented my young budding age , And doth , unless your mildness passions quell , My utter ruin near at hand presage . Instead of blood which wont was to display His ruddy red upon my hairless face , By over-grieving that is fled away , Pale dying colour there hath taken place . Those curlèd locks which thou wast wont to twist Unkempt , unshorn , and out of order been ; Since my disgrace I had of them no list , Since when these eyes no joyful day have seen Nor never shall till you renew again The mutual love which did possess us twain . XLIX You that embrace enchanting poesy , Be gracious to perplexèd Corin 's lines ; You that do feel love 's proud authority , Help me to sing my sighs and sad designs . Chloris , requite not faithful love with scorn , But as thou oughtest have commiseration ; I have enough anatomised and torn My heart , thereof to make a pure oblation . Likewise consider how thy Corin prizeth Thy parts above each absolute perfection , How he of every precious thing deviseth To make thee sovereign . Grant me then affection ! Else thus I prize thee : Chloris is alone More hard than gold or pearl or precious stone .</p>
