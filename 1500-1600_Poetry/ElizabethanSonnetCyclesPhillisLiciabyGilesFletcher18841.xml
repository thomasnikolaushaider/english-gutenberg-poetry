    <head>INTRODUCTION</head>
    <p n="1">The last decade of the sixteenth century was marked by an outburst of sonneteering . To devotees of the sonnet , who find in that poetic form the moat perfect vehicle that has ever been devised for the expression of a single importunate emotion , it will not seem strange that at the threshold of a literary period whose characteristic note is the most intense personality , the instinct of poets should have directed them to the form most perfectly fitted for the expression of this inner motive .</p>
    <p n="2">The sonnet , a distinguished guest from Italy , was ushered to by those two “ courtly makers , ” Wyatt and Surrey , in the days of Henry VIII . But when , forty years later , the foreigner was to be acclimatised in England , her robe had to be altered to suit an English fashion . Thus the sonnet , which had been an octave of enclosed or alternate rhymes , followed by a sestette of interlaced tercets , was now changed to a series of three quatrains with differing sets of alternate rhymes in each , at the close of which the insidious couplet succeeded in establishing itself . But these changes were not made without a great deal of experiment ; and during the tentative period the name “ sonnet ” was given , to a wide variety of forms , in the moulding of which but one rule seemed to be uniformly obeyed — that the poem should be the expression of a single , simple emotion . This law cut the poem , to a relative shortness and defined its dignity and clearness . Beyond this almost every combination of rhymes might be found , verses were occasionally lengthened or shortened , and the number of lines in the poem , though generally fourteen , showed considerable variation .</p>
    <p n="3">The sonnet-sequence was also a suggestion from Italy , a literary fashion introduced by Sir Philip Sidney , in his Astrophel and Stella , written soon after 1580 , but not published till 1591 . In a sonnet-cycle Sidney recorded his love and sorrow , and Spenser took up the strain with his story of love and joy . Grouped about these , and following in their wake , a number of poets , before the decade was over , turned this Elizabethan “ toy ” to their purpose in their various self-revealings , producing a group of sonnet-cycles more or less Italianate in form or thought , more or less experimental , more or less poetical , more or less the expression of a real passion . For while the form of the sonnet was modified by metrical traditions and habits , the content also was strongly influenced , not to say restricted , by certain conventions of thought considered at the time appropriate to the poetic attitude . The passion for classic colour in the poetic world , which had inspired and disciplined English genius in the sixties and seventies , was rather nourished than repressed when in the eighties Spenser 's Shepherd 's Calendar and Sidney 's Arcadia made the pastoral imagery a necessity . Cupid and Diana were made very much at home in the golden world of the renaissance Arcadia , and the sonneteer singing the praises of his mistress 's eyebrow was not far removed from the lovelorn shepherd of the plains .</p>
    <p n="4">It may reasonably be expected that in any sonnet-cycle there will be found many sonnets in praise of the loved one 's beauty , many lamenting her hardness of heart ; all the wonders of heaven and earth will be catalogued to find comparisons for her loveliness ; the river by which she dwells will be more pleasant than all other rivers in the world , a list of them being appended in proof ; the thoughts of night-time , when the lover bemoans himself and his rejected state , or dreams of happy love , will be dwelt upon ; oblivious sleep and the wan-faced moon will be invoked , and death will be called upon for respite . Love and the praises of the loved one was the theme . On this old but ever new refrain the sonneteer devised his descant , trilling joyously on oaten pipe in praise of Delia or Phyllis , Coelia , Cælica , Aurora , or Castara .</p>
    <p n="5">But this melody and descant were not , in some ears at least , without monotony . For after Daniel 's Delia , Constable 's Diana , Lodge 's Phillis , Drayton 's Idea , Fletcher 's Licia , Brooke 's Cælica , Percy 's Coelia , N. L . ' s Zepheria , and J. C .' s Alcilia , and perhaps a few other sonnet-cycles had been written , Chapman in 1595 made his Coronet for his Mistress Philosophy , the opening sonnet of which reveals his critical attitude :</p>
    <p n="6">“ Muses that sing Love 's sensual empery , And lovers kindling your enragèd fires At Cupid 's bonfires burning in the eye , Blown with the empty breath of vain desires , You that prefer the painted cabinet Before the wealthy jewels it doth store ye , That all your joys in dying figures set , And stain the living substance of your glory , Abjure those joys , abhor their memory , And let my love the honoured subject be Of love , and honour 's complete history ; Your eyes were never yet let in to see The majesty and riches of the mind , But dwell in darkness ; for your god is blind . ”</p>
    <p n="7">It must be confessed that the “ painted cabinet ” of the lady 's beauty absorbs more attention than the “ majesty and riches of the mind , ” but the glints of a loftier ideal shining now and then among the conventions , lift the cycle above the level of mere ear-pleasing rhythms and fantastical imageries . Moreover , the sonnet-cycles on the whole show an independence and spontaneousness of poetic energy , a delight in the pure joy of making , a naïveté , that richly frame the picture of the golden world they present . When Lodge , addressing his “ pleasing thoughts , apprentices of love , ” cries out :</p>
    <p n="8">“ Show to the world , though poor and scant my skill is , How sweet thoughts be that are but thought on Phillis , ”</p>
    <p n="9">we feel that we are being taken back to an age more childlike than our own ; and when the sonneteers vie with each other on the themes of sleep , death , time , and immortality , the door often stands open toward sublimity . Then when the sonnet-cycle was consecrated to noble and spiritual uses in Chapman 's Coronet for his Mistress Philosophy , Barnes 's Divine Century of Spiritual Sonnets , Constable 's Spiritual Sonnets in Honour of God and His Saints , and Donne 's Holy Sonnets , all made before 1600 , the symbolic theme was added to the conventions of the sonnet-realm , the scope of its content was broadened ; and the sonnet was well on its way toward a time when it could be named a trumpet , upon which a mighty voice could blow soul-animating strains .</p>
    <p n="10">One of the most fascinating questions in the study of the sonnet-cycles is as to how much basis the story has in reality . Stella we know , the star-crossed love of Sidney , and Spenser 's happy Elizabeth , but —</p>
    <p n="11">“ Who is Silvia ? What is she That all the swains commend her ? ”</p>
    <p n="12">Who is Delia , Diana , Coelia , Cælica , and all the rhyming of musical names ? And who is the Dark Lady ? What personalities hide behind these poet 's imaginings ? We know that now , as in troubadour days , the praises of grand ladies were sung with a warmth of language that should indicate personal acquaintance when no such acquaintance existed ; and the sonneteers sometimes frankly confessed their passion “ but supposed . ” All this adds to the difficulty of interpretation . In most cases the poet has effectually kept his secret ; the search is futile , in spite of all the “ scholastic labour-lost ” devoted to it . Equally tantalising are the fleeting symbolisms that suggest themselves now and then . The confession sometimes made by the poet , that high-flown compliment and not true despair is intended , prepares us to accept the symbolic application where it forces itself upon us , and to feel the presence here and there of platonic or spiritual shadowings . Those who do not find pleasure in the Arcadian world of the sonneteer 's fancy , may still justify their taste in the aspiration that speaks in his flashes of philosophy .</p>

   <head>THOMAS LODGE</head>
   <p>One of the first to take up the new fashion of the sonnet-cycle , was Thomas Lodge , whose “ Phillis ” was published in 1595 . Lodge had a wide acquaintance among the authors of his time , and was in the thick of the literary activity in the last two decades of the sixteenth century . But in spite of his interesting personality and genius , he has had to wait until the present time for full appreciation . To his own age he may have appeared as a literary dilettante , who tried his hand at several forms of writing , and being outshone by the more excellent in each field , gave up the attempt and turned to the practice of medicine . This profession engaged him for the last twenty-five years of his life , until his death in 1625 at the advanced age of sixty-seven or eight . During all these years the gay young “ university wit ” of earlier days was probably forgotten in the venerable and successful physician . It was as “ old Doctor Lodge ” that he was satirised in a Cambridge student 's Common-place Book in 1611 . Heywood mentions him in 1609 among the six most famous physicians in England , and in the Return from Parnassus , a play acted in 1602 , he is described as “ turning over Galen every day . ”</p>
   <p>Yet no one had been in the last twenty years the sixteenth century more responsive than Lodge to the shifting moods of that excitable period . Lodge was the son of a Lord Mayor of London , and was a contemporary at Oxford with Sidney , Gosson , Chapman , Lyly , Peele and Watson . His life included a round of varied experiences . A student at Lincoln 's Inn , a young aspirant for literary honours , friends with Greene , Rich , Daniel , Drayton , Lyly and Watson , a taster of the sorrows that many of the University wits endured when usurers got their hands upon them , for a time perhaps a soldier , certainly a sailor following the fortunes of Captain Clarke to Terceras and the Canaries , and of Cavendish to Brazil and the Straits of Magellan , in London again making plays with Greene , off to Avignon to take his degree in medicine , back again to be incorporated an M. D . at Oxford and to practise in London , adopting secretly the Roman Catholic faith , and sometimes hiding on the continent as a recusant from persecution at home , imprisoned perhaps once for debt , and entertaining a concourse of patients of his own religion till his death in 1625 :— the life of Lodge thus presents a view of the ups and downs possible in that picturesque age .</p>
   <p>The wide variety of his literary ventures reflects the interests of his life . Some controversial papers , some unsuccessful plays , two dull historical sketches in prose , some satirical and moralising works in prose and in verse , two romantic tales in verse and three in prose , a number of eclogues , metrical epistles and lyrics , some ponderous translations from Latin and French , and two medical treatises ; these widely differing kinds of writing are the products of Lodge 's industry and genius . All , however , have but an antiquarian interest save two ; the prose romance called Rosalynde , Euphues ’ Golden Legacy , could not be spared since Shakespeare borrowed its charming plot for As You Like It ; and Phillis , bound up with a sheaf of his lyrics gathered from the pages of his stories and from the miscellanies of the time , should be treasured for its own sake and should keep Lodge 's memory green for lovers of pure poetry .</p>
   <p>Lodge 's lyric genius was a clear if slender rill . His faults are the more unpardonable since they spring from sheer carelessness and a lack of appreciation of the sacred responsibility of creative power . He took up the literary fashion of the month and tried his hand at it ; that done , he was ready for the next mode . He did not wait to perfect his work or to compare result with result ; therefore he probably never found himself , probably never realised that after three centuries he would be esteemed , not for the ponderous tomes of his translation of Josephus , not for all the catalogues of his satirical and religious and scientific writings , but for mere lyrics like the “ Heigh ho , fair Rosaline , ” and “ Love in my bosom like a bee , ” heedlessly imbedded in the heart of a prose romance .</p>
   <p>Lodge was one of the earliest to follow the example of Sidney in linking a sequence of sonnets together into a sonnet-cycle . The Astrophel and Stella was published in 1591 , though it had doubtless before this been handed about , as was the Elizabethan fashion , in manuscript . Early in 1591 also when Daniel was probably abroad , twenty-seven of the fifty-seven sonnets that a year later formed the sonnet-cycle Delia were published in his absence . Now in August of 1591 Lodge set sail with Cavendish on that long voyage to Brazil and the Straits of Magellan from which he did not return till early in ninety-three , and it was during his absence that Daniel 's and Constable 's sonnet-cycles came out . It is possible that Lodge saw Daniel 's series , as he doubtless did Sidney 's , in manuscript before he left England , but the Induction to Phillis , which carries a message to Delia 's “ sweet prophet , ” was almost certainly written later , and in the absence of further proof it seems no more than fair to allow Lodge to share with Daniel and Constable the honour of being the earliest to take the hint Sidney had offered .</p>
   <p>On the whole , Lodge 's sonnets show a much more cheerful and buoyant temper than Daniel 's “ wailing verse . ” The “ sad horror , pale grief , prostrate despair ” that inform the Delia , are replaced in the Phillis by a spirit of airy toying , a pleasure in the graces of fancy even when they cluster around a feeling of sadness . During Lodge 's absence , his friend Robert Green published several pieces for him , and in one of the prefaces promised the public to present on his return “ what labours Lodge 's sea-studies afford . ” Phillis was the chief of these sea-studies , and was like Rosalynde “ hatcht in the stormes of the ocean and feathered in the surges of many perillous seas . ” But as far as the imagery of the sonnets is concerned , the pageantry of day and night at sea might have passed before blinded eyes ; if it made any impression , it was in the form of ocean-nymphs and Cupid at the helm . The poet was in Arcadia , Phillis was a shepherdess , and the conventional imageries of the pastoral valley were the environment . “ May it please you , ” he says in dedicating the book to the Countess of Shrewsbury , “ to looke and like of homlie Phillis in her Country caroling , and to countenance her poore and affectionate sheapheard . ” The Countess of Shrewsbury he chooses for the “ Sovereign and she-Mæcenas ” of his toil , and promises her “ as much in affection as any other can performe in perfection ; ” but the name of Phillis is no cover for the personality of a grand lady , and therefore no puzzling questions disturb the pleasure of the reader as the gentle modulations , the insidious alliterations , and the musical cadences of his double rhymes fall upon the ear .</p>
   <p>Yet for this name or ideal , or whatever Phillis represented in the poet 's thought , he has poured forth a passion that has an air of sincerity , an artless freshness , a flute-like clearness of tone , as rare as delightful . It is the very voice of the oaten pipe itself , thin , clear , and pure . The touches of seriousness are impossible , to mistake . When the poet avows his faith in Phillis ’ constancy , after giving the usual catalogue of her beauties , he says :</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ At thy fair hands who wonders not at all</l>
     <l n="2">Wonder itself through ignorance embases ;</l>
     <l n="3">Yet not the less though wondrous gifts you call these</l>
     <l n="4">My faith is far more wonderful than all these . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">When Phillis persists in her disdain , he cries out impulsively :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="6">“ Burst , burst , poor heart , thou hast no longer hope ! ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Even when re-moulding the familiar pastoral conceits , he makes the fancies his own and gives to them a unique touch and spirit . Mere conventions he rates at their proper value . His pen shall not “ riot in pompous style . ” He claims a brighter aspect for his poetical devotion than his fellow-sonneteers manifest :</p>
   <p>“ No stars her ; eyes .... .... but beams that clear the sight Of him that seeks the true philosophy . ”</p>
   <p>In spite of its defects , the lax structure of the sonnet-form , the obscurities and needless blurring , and the disappointing inequalities , Phillis takes a high place among the sonnet-cycles , and must ever be dear to lovers of quiet , melodious verse , who have made themselves at home in the golden world of the pastoral poets and mislike not the country-carolling heard therein .</p>

   <p>LICIA</p>
   <p>OR</p>
   <p>POEMS OF LOVE IN HONOR OF THE ADMIRABLE AND SINGULAR VIRTUES OF HIS LADY , TO THE IMITATION OF THE BEST LATIN POETS AND OTHERS</p>
   <p>BY</p>
   <p>GILES FLETCHER , LL. D .</p>
   <p>GILES FLETCHER , LL. D .</p>
   <p>Giles Fletcher , author of Licia , was one of that distinguished family that included Richard Fletcher , the Bishop of London , and his son John Fletcher , the dramatist . The two sons of Dr. Giles Fletcher were also men of marked poetic ability : Phineas , the author of that extraordinary allegorical poem , The Purple Island ; and Giles , of Christ 's Victory and Triumph . There was a strong family feeling in this circle ; Phineas and Giles pay compliments to each other in their verse and show great reverence and tenderness toward the memory of the poetic powers of their father . But Giles Fletcher the elder was not thought of in his own time as a poet . Educated at Eton and Trinity , Cambridge , where he was made LL. D . in 1581 , a member of Parliament in ‘ 85 , employed in many public services at home and abroad during a career that lasted until 1611 , in which year Dr. Fletcher died at the age of seventy-two , he was known as a man of action , a man for public responsibility , rather than as the retired scholar or riming courtier . Most important among the foreign embassages undertaken by Fletcher was the one to Russia . The results were of great import to England , commercially and otherwise , but the book he wrote on his return was , for political reasons , suppressed .</p>
   <p>It happened that the years of enforced idleness that followed the suppression of this book came in the time when the young sonneteers at London were all busy . He returned from his embassage in ‘ 89 ; the book was suppressed in ‘ 91 . Licia was published in ‘ 93 . The writing of Licia was “ rather an effect than a cause of idleness ; ” he did it “ only to try his humor , ” he says apologetically in the dedicatory addresses . “ Whereas my thoughts and some reasons drew me rather to have dealt in causes of greater weight , yet the present jar of this disagreeing age drives me into a fit so melancholy , as I had only leisure to grow passionate . ”</p>
   <p>In case wise heads should think him to be treating “ an idle subject and so frivolous , ” or that it has been “ vainly handled and so odious , ” he sets forth the nobility of his view . “ Howsoever , Love in this age hath behaved himself in that loose manner as it is counted a disgrace to give him but a kind look , yet I take the passion in itself to be of that honor and credit , as it is a perfect resemblance of the greatest happiness , and rightly valued at his just price ( in a mind that is sincerely and truly amorous ) , an affection of greatest virtue and able of himself to eternise the meanest vassal . ” “ For Love , ” he declares , “ is a goddess ( pardon me though I speak like a poet ) not respecting the contentment of him that loves , but the virtues of the beloved ; satisfied with wondering , fed with admiration ; respecting nothing but his lady 's worthiness ; made as happy by love as by all favors ; chaste by honor ; far from violence ; respecting but one , and that one in such kindness , honesty , truth , constancy , and honor , as were all the world offered to make a change , yet the boot were too small and therefore bootless . This is love , and far more than this , which I know a vulgar head , a base mind , an ordinary conceit , a common person will not nor cannot have . Thus do I commend that love wherewith in these poems I have honoured the worthy Licia . ”</p>
   <p>The sonnet-cycle is inscribed “ To the worthie kinde wise and virtuous ladie , the Ladie Mollineux ; wife to the right worshipful Sir Richard Mollineux Knight . ” Nothing is known of this lady , except that her family may possibly have been very distantly connected with that of Fletcher . What the poet 's feeling was towards his patroness he defines sufficiently . “ Now in that I have written love sonnets , if any man measure my affection by my style , let him say I am in love .... Yet take this by the way ; though I am so liberal to grant thus much , a man may write of love and not be in love , as well as of husbandry and not go to the plough , or of witches and be none , or of holiness and be flat profane . ”</p>
   <p>What “ shadowings ” the poet may intend he refuses to confide to us . “ If thou muse what my Licia is , take her to be some Diana , at the least chaste ; or some Minerva ; no Venus , fairer far . It may be she is Learning 's image , or some heavenly wonder , which the precisest may not dislike : perhaps under that name I have shadowed Discipline . It may be I mean that kind courtesy which I found at the patroness of these poems . It may be some college ; it may be my conceit , and portend nothing . ” It is evident then that the patroness herself is not the real person behind the poetic title . He therefore dedicates Licia to Lady Molineux , not because the sonnets themselves are addressed to her , but because he has received “ favours undeserved ” at her hands and those of “ wise Sir Richard ” for which he “ wants means to make recompence , ” and therefore in the meantime he begs her to accept this . “ If thou like it , ” he says to the reader , “ take it , and thank the worthy Lady Mollineux , for whose sake thou hast it ; worthy , indeed , and so not only reputed by me in private affection of thankfulness but so equally to be esteemed by all that know her . For if I had not received of her ... those unrequitable favours , I had not thus idly toyed . ”</p>
   <p>A warm admirer of Fletcher has expressed his opinion that Licia “ sparkles with brilliants of the first water . ” A more temperate judgment is that of another , who says that he “ took part without discredit in the choir of singers who were men of action too . ” Licia is what a typical sonnet-cycle ought to be , a delicate and almost intangible thread of story on which are strung the separate sonnet-pearls . In this case the jewels have a particular finish . Fletcher has adopted the idea of a series of quatrains , often extending the number to four , and a concluding couplet , which he seems fond of utilising to give an epigrammatic finish to the ingenious incident he so often makes the subject of the sonnet . He is fully in the spirit of the Italian mode , however , acknowledging in his title page his indebtedness to poets of other nationalities than his own .</p>
