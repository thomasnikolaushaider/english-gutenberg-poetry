     <l n="4">Her fancy fell a-turning .</l>
     <l n="5">Long was the combat doubtful , that love with love did fight ,</l>
     <l n="6">To leave the master loveless , or kill the gallant knight ;</l>
     <l n="7">To put in practice either , alas , it was a spite</l>
     <l n="8">Unto the silly damsel !</l>
     <l n="9">But one must be refused , more mickle was the pain ,</l>
     <l n="10">That nothing could be used , to turn them both to gain ,</l>
     <l n="11">For of the two the trusty knight was wounded with disdain :</l>
     <l n="12">Alas , she could not help it !</l>
     <l n="13">Thus art , with arms contending , was victor of the day ,</l>
     <l n="14">Which by a gift of learnlng did bear the maid away ;</l>
     <l n="15">Then , lullaby , the learned man hath got the lady gay ;</l>
     <l n="16">For now my song is ended .</l>

      <l n="22">All unseen , ‘ gan passage find ;</l>
      <l n="23">That the lover , sick to death ,</l>

      <l n="5">As it fell upon a day</l>
      <l n="6">In the merry month of May ,</l>
      <l n="7">Sitting in a pleasant shade</l>
      <l n="8">Which a grove of myrtles made ,</l>
      <l n="9">Beasts did leap , and birds did sing ,</l>
      <l n="10">Trees did grow , and plants did spring ;</l>
      <l n="11">Everything did banish moan ,</l>
      <l n="12">Save the nightingale alone :</l>
      <l n="13">She , poor bird , as all forlorn ,</l>
      <l n="14">Lean 'd her breast up-till a thorn ,</l>
      <l n="15">And there sung the dolefull'st ditty ,</l>
      <l n="16">That to hear it was great pity :</l>
      <l n="17">Fie , fie , fie , now would she cry ;</l>
      <l n="18">Teru , teru , by and by :</l>
      <l n="19">That to hear her so complain ,</l>
      <l n="20">Scarce I could from tears refrain ;</l>
      <l n="21">For her griefs , so lively shown ,</l>
      <l n="22">Made me think upon mine own .</l>
      <l n="23">Ah , thought I , thou mourn'st in vain ;</l>
      <l n="24">None take pity on thy pain :</l>
      <l n="25">Senseless trees , they cannot hear thee ;</l>
      <l n="26">Ruthless bears , they will not cheer thee .</l>
      <l n="27">King Pandion , he is dead ;</l>
      <l n="28">All thy friends are lapp 'd in lead ;</l>
      <l n="29">All thy fellow-birds do sing ,</l>
      <l n="30">Careless of thy sorrowing .</l>
      <l n="31">Even so , poor bird , like thee ,</l>
      <l n="32">None alive will pity me .</l>
      <l n="33">Whilst as fickle fortune smil 'd ,</l>
      <l n="34">Thou and I were both beguil 'd .</l>
      <l n="35">Every one that flatters thee</l>
      <l n="36">Is no friend in misery .</l>
      <l n="37">Words are easy like the wind ;</l>
      <l n="38">Faithful friends are hard to find .</l>
      <l n="39">Every man will be thy friend ,</l>
      <l n="40">Whilst thou hast wherewith to spend ;</l>
      <l n="41">But if store of crowns be scant ,</l>
      <l n="42">No man will supply thy want .</l>
      <l n="43">If that one be prodigal ,</l>
      <l n="44">Bountiful they will him call :</l>
      <l n="45">And with such-like flattering ,</l>
      <l n="46">‘ Pity but he were a king . ’</l>
      <l n="47">If he be addict to vice ,</l>
      <l n="48">Quickly him they will entice ;</l>
      <l n="49">If to women he be bent ,</l>
      <l n="50">They have at commandement :</l>
      <l n="51">But if fortune once do frown ,</l>
      <l n="52">Then farewell his great renown :</l>
      <l n="53">They that fawn 'd on him before ,</l>
      <l n="54">Use his company no more .</l>
      <l n="55">He that is thy frend indeed ,</l>

      <l n="59">Thus of every grief in heart</l>
      <l n="60">He with thee doth bear a part .</l>
      <l n="61">These are certain signs to know</l>
      <l n="62">Faithful friend from flattering foe .</l>
