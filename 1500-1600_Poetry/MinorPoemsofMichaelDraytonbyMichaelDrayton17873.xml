   <div type="introduction">
    <head>INTRODUCTION</head>
    <p n="1">Michael Drayton was born in 1563 , at Hartshill , near Atherstone , in Warwickshire , where a cottage , said to have been his , is still shown . He early became a page to Sir Henry Goodere , at Polesworth Hall : his own words give the best picture of his early years here .<span corresp="#note1" type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>His education would seem to have been good , but ordinary ; and it is very doubtful if he ever went to a university .<span corresp="#note2" type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>Besides the authors mentioned in the Epistle to Henry Reynolds , he was certainly familiar with Ovid and Horace , and possibly with Catullus : while there seems no reason to doubt that he read Greek , though it is quite true that his references to Greek authors do not prove any first-hand acquaintance . He understood French , and read Rabelais and the French sonneteers , and he seems to have been acquainted with Italian .<span corresp="#note3" type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>His knowledge of English literature was wide , and his judgement good : but his chief bent lay towards the history , legendary and otherwise , of his native country , and his vast stores of learning on this subject bore fruit in the Polyolbion .</p>
    <p n="2">While still at Polesworth , Drayton fell in love with his patron 's younger daughter , Anne ;<span corresp="#note4" type="note_anchor">[ 4 ]</span>and , though she married , in 1596 , Sir Henry Rainsford of Clifford , Drayton continued his devotion to her for many years , and also became an intimate friend of her husband 's , writing a sincere elegy on his death .<span corresp="#note5" type="note_anchor">[ 5 ]</span>About February , 1591 , Drayton paid a visit to London , and published his first work , the Harmony of the Church , a series of paraphrases from the Old Testament , in fourteen-syllabled verse of no particular vigour or grace . This book was immediately suppressed by order of Archbishop Whitgift , possibly because it was supposed to savour of Puritanism .<span corresp="#note6" type="note_anchor">[ 6 ]</span>The author , however , published another edition in 1610 ; indeed , he seems to have had a fondness for this style of work ; for in 1604 he published a dull poem , Moyses in a Map of his Miracles , re-issued in 1630 as Moses his Birth and Miracles . Accompanying this piece , in 1630 , were two other ‘ Divine poems ': Noah 's Floud , and David and Goliath . Noah 's Floud is , in part , one of Drayton 's happiest attempts at the catalogue style of bestiary ; and Mr. Elton finds in it some foreshadowing of the manner of Paradise Lost . But , as a whole , Drayton 's attempts in this direction deserve the oblivion into which they , in common with the similar productions of other authors , have fallen . In the dedication and preface to the Harmony of the Church are some of the few traces of Euphuism shown in Drayton 's work ; passages in the Heroical Epistles also occur to the mind .<span corresp="#note7" type="note_anchor">[ 7 ]</span>He was always averse to affectation , literary or otherwise , and in Elegy viij deliberately condemns Lyly 's fantastic style .</p>
    <p n="3">Probably before Drayton went up to London , Sir Henry Goodere saw that he would stand in need of a patron more powerful than the master of Polesworth , and introduced him to the Earl and Countess of Bedford . Those who believe<span corresp="#note8" type="note_anchor">[ 8 ]</span>Drayton to have been a Pope in petty spite , identify the ‘ Idea ’ of his earlier poems with Lucy , Countess of Bedford ; though they are forced to acknowledge as self-evident that the ‘ Idea ’ of his later work is Anne , Lady Rainsford . They then proceed to say that Drayton , after consistently honouring the Countess in his verse for twelve years , abruptly transferred his allegiance , not forgetting to heap foul abuse on his former patroness , out of pique at some temporary withdrawal of favour . Not only is this directly contrary to all we know and can infer of Drayton 's character , but Mr. Elton has decisively disproved it by a summary of bibliographical and other evidence . Into the question it is here unnecessary to enter , and it has been mentioned only because it alone , of the many Drayton-controversies , has cast any slur on the poet 's reputation .</p>
    <p n="4">In 1593 , Drayton published Idea , the Shepherds Garland , in nine Eclogues ; in 1606 he added a tenth , the best of all , to the new edition , and rearranged the order , so that the new eclogue became the ninth . In these Pastorals , while following the Shepherds Calendar in many ways , he already displays something of the sturdy independence which characterized him through life . He abandons Spenser 's quasi-rustic dialect , and , while keeping to most of the pastoral conventions , such as the singing-match and threnody , he contrives to introduce something of a more natural and homely strain . He keeps the political allusions , notably in the Eclogue containing the song in praise of Beta , who is , of course , Queen Elizabeth . But an over-bold remark in the last line of that song was struck out in 1606 ; and the new eclogue has no political reference . He is not ashamed to allude directly to Spenser ; and indeed his direct debts are limited to a few scattered phrases , as in the Ballad of Dowsabel . Almost to the end of his literary career , Drayton mentions Spenser with reverence and praise .<span corresp="#note9" type="note_anchor">[ 9 ]</span></p>
    <p n="5">It is in the songs interspersed in the Eclogues that Drayton 's best work at this time is to be found : already his metrical versatility is discernible ; for though he doubtless remembered the many varieties of metre employed by Spenser in the Calendar , his verses already bear a stamp of their own . The long but impetuous lines , such as ‘ Trim up her golden tresses with Apollo 's sacred tree ’ , afford a striking contrast to the archaic romance-metre , derived from Sir Thopas and its fellows , which appears in Dowsabel , and it again to the melancholy , murmuring cadences of the lament for Elphin . It must , however , be confessed that certain of the songs in the 1593 edition were full of recondite conceits and laboured antitheses , and were rightly struck out , to be replaced by lovelier poems , in the edition of 1606 . The song to Beta was printed in Englands Helicon , 1600 ; here , for the first time , appeared the song of Dead Love , and for the only time , Rowlands Madrigal . In these songs , Drayton offends least in grammar , always a weak point with him ; in the body of the Eclogues , in the earlier Sonnets , in the Odes , occur the most extraordinary and perplexing inversions . Quite the most striking feature of the Eclogues , especially in their later form , is their bold attempt at greater realism , at a breaking-away from the conventional images and scenery .</p>
    <p n="6">Having paid his tribute to one poetic fashion , Drayton in 1594 fell in with the prevailing craze for sonneteering , and published Ideas Mirrour , a series of fifty-one ‘ amours ’ or sonnets , with two prefatory poems , one by Drayton and one by an unknown , signing himself Gorbo il fidele . The title of these poems Drayton possibly borrowed from the French sonneteer , de Pontoux : in their style much recollection of Sidney , Constable , and Daniel is traceable . They are ostensibly addressed to his mistress , and some of them are genuine in feeling ; but many are merely imitative exercises in conceit ; some , apparently , trials in metre . These amours were again printed , with the title of ‘ sonnets ’ , in 1599<span corresp="#note10" type="note_anchor">[ 10 ]</span>, 1600 , 1602 , 1603 , 1605 , 1608 , 1610 , 1613 , 1619 , and 1631 , during the poet 's lifetime . It is needless here to discuss whether Drayton were the ‘ rival poet ’ to Shakespeare , whether these sonnets were really addressed to a man , or merely to the ideal Platonic beauty ; for those who are interested in these points , I subjoin references to the sonnets which touch upon them .<span corresp="#note11" type="note_anchor">[ 11 ]</span>From the prentice-work evident in many of the Amours , it would seem that certain of them are among Drayton 's earliest poems ; but others show a craftsman not meanly advanced in his art . Nevertheless , with few exceptions , this first ‘ bundle of sonnets ’ consists rather of trials of skill , bubbles of the mind ; most of his sonnets which strike the reader as touched or penetrated with genuine passion belong to the editions from 1599 onwards ; implying that his love for Anne Goodere , if at all represented in these poems , grew with his years , for the ‘ love-parting ’ is first found in the edition of 1619 . But for us the question should not be , are these sonnets genuine representations of the personal feeling of the poet ? but rather , how far do they arouse or echo in us as individuals the universal passion ? There are at least some of Drayton 's sonnets which possess a direct , instant , and universal appeal , by reason of their simple force and straightforward ring ; and not in virtue of any subtle charm of sound and rhythm , or overmastering splendour of diction or thought . Ornament vanishes , and soberness and simplicity increase , as we proceed in the editions of the sonnets . Drayton 's chief attempt in the jewelled or ornamental style appeared in 1595 , with the title of Endimion and Phoebe , and was , in a sense , an imitation of Marlowe 's Hero and Leander . Hero and Leander is , as Swinburne says , a shrine of Parian marble , illumined from within by a clear flame of passion ; while Endimion and Phoebe is rather a curiously wrought tapestry , such as that in Mortimer 's Tower , woven in splendid and harmonious colours , wherein , however , the figures attain no clearness or subtlety of outline , and move in semi-conventional scenery . It is , none the less , graceful and impressive , and of a like musical fluency with other poems of its class , such as Venus and Adonis , or Salmacis and Hermaphrodius . Parts of it were re-set and spoilt in a 1606 publication of Drayton 's , called The Man in the Moone .</p>
    <p n="7">In 1593 and 1594 Drayton also published his earliest pieces on the mediaeval theme of the ‘ Falls of the Illustrious ’ ; they were Peirs Gavesson and Matilda the faire and chaste daughter of the Lord Robert Fitzwater . Here Drayton followed in the track of Boccaccio , Lydgate , and the Mirrour for Magistrates , walking in the way which Chaucer had derided in his Monkes Tale : and with only too great fidelity does Drayton adapt himself to the dullnesses of his model : fine rhetoric is not altogether wanting , and there is , of course , the consciousness that these subjects deal with the history of his beloved country , but neither these , nor Robert , Duke of Normandy ( 1596 ) , nor Great Cromwell , Earl of Essex ( 1607 and 1609 ) , nor the Miseries of Margaret ( 1627 ) can escape the charge of tediousness .<span corresp="#note12" type="note_anchor">[ 12 ]</span>England 's Heroical Epistles were first published in 1597 , and other editions , of 1598 , 1599 , and 1602 , contain new epistles . These are Drayton 's first attempt to strike out a new and original vein of English poetry : they are a series of letters , modelled on Ovid 's Heroides ,<span corresp="#note13" type="note_anchor">[ 13 ]</span>addressed by various pairs of lovers , famous in English history , to each other , and arranged in chronological order , from Henry II and Rosamond to Lady Jane Grey and Lord Guilford Dudley . They are , in a sense , the most important of Drayton 's writings , and they have certainly been the most popular , up to the early nineteenth century . In these poems Drayton foreshadowed , and probably inspired , the smooth style of Fairfax , Waller , and Dryden . The metre , the grammar , and the thought , are all perfectly easy to follow , even though he employs many of the Ovidian ‘ turns ’ and ‘ clenches ’ . A certain attempt at realization of the different characters is observable , but the poems are fine rhetorical exercises rather than realizations of the dramatic and passionate possibilities of their themes . In 1596 , Drayton , as we have seen , published the Mortimeriados , a kind of epic , with Mortimer as its hero , of the wars between King Edward II and the Barons .<span corresp="#note14" type="note_anchor">[ 14 ]</span>It was written in the seven-line stanza of Chaucer 's Troilus and Cressida and Spenser 's Hymns . On its republication in 1603 , with the title of the Barons ’ Wars , the metre was changed to ottava rima , and Drayton showed , in an excellent preface , that he fully appreciated the principles and the subtleties of the metrical art . While possessing many fine passages , the Barons ’ Wars is somewhat dull , lacking much of the poetry of the older version ; and does not escape from Drayton 's own criticism of Daniel 's Chronicle Poems : ‘ too much historian in verse , ... His rhymes were smooth , his metres well did close , But yet his manner better fitted prose ’ .<span corresp="#note15" type="note_anchor">[ 15 ]</span>The description of Mortimer 's Tower in the sixth book recalls the ornate style of Endimion and Phoebe , while the fifth book , describing the miseries of King Edward , is the most moving and dramatic . But there is a general lifelessness and lack of movement for which these purple passages barely atone . The cause of the production of so many chronicle poems about this time has been supposed<span corresp="#note16" type="note_anchor">[ 16 ]</span>to be the desire of showing the horrors of civil war , at a time when the queen was growing old , and no successor had , as it seemed , been accepted . Also they were a kind of parallel to the Chronicle Play ; and Drayton , in any case even if we grant him to have been influenced by the example of Daniel , never needed much incentive to treat a national theme .</p>
    <p n="8">About this time , we find Drayton writing for the stage . It seems unnecessary here to discuss whether the writing of plays is evidence of Drayton 's poverty , or his versatility ;<span corresp="#note17" type="note_anchor">[ 17 ]</span>but the fact remains that he had a hand in the production of about twenty . Of these , the only one which certainly survives is The first part of the true and honorable historie , of the life of Sir John Oldcastle , the good Lord Cobham , &amp; c. It is practically impossible to distinguish Drayton 's share in this curious play , and it does not , therefore , materially assist the elucidation of the question whether he had any dramatic feeling or skill . It can be safely affirmed that the dramatic instinct was nor uppermost in his mind ; he was a Seneca rather than a Euripides : but to deny him all dramatic idea , as does Dr. Whitaker , is too severe . There is decided , if slender , dramatic skill and feeling in certain of the Nymphals . Drayton 's persons are usually , it must be said , rather figures in a tableau , or series of tableaux ; but in the second and seventh Nymphals , and occasionally in the tenth , there is real dramatic movement . Closely connected with this question is the consideration of humour , which is wrongly denied to Drayton . Humour is observable first , perhaps , in the Owle ( 1604 ) ; then in the Ode to his Rival ( 1619 ) ; and later in the Nymphidia , Shepheards Sirena , and Muses Elyzium . The second Nymphal shows us the quiet laughter , the humorous twinkle , with which Drayton writes at times . The subject is an [ Greek : agôn ] or contest between two shepherds for the affections of a nymph called Lirope : Lalus is a vale-bred swain , of refined and elegant manners , skilled , nevertheless , in all manly sports and exercises ; Cleon , no less a master in physical prowess , was nurtured by a hind in the mountains ; the contrast between their manners is admirably sustained : Cleon is rough , inclined to be rude and scoffing , totally without tact , even where his mistress is concerned . Lalus remembers her upbringing and her tastes ; he makes no unnecessary or ostentatious display of wealth ; his gifts are simple and charming , while Cleon 's are so grotesquely unsuited to a swain , that it is tempting to suppose that Drayton was quietly satirizing Marlowe 's Passionate Shepherd . Lirope listens gravely to the swains in turn , and makes demure but provoking answers , raising each to the height of hope , and then casting them both down into the depths of despair ; finally she refuses both , yet without altogether killing hope . Her first answer is a good specimen of her banter and of Drayton 's humour .<span corresp="#note18" type="note_anchor">[ 18 ]</span></p>
    <p n="9">On the accession of James I , Drayton hastened to greet the King with a somewhat laboured song To the Maiestie of King James ; but this poem was apparently considered to be premature : he cried Vivat Rex , without having said , Mortua est eheu Regina , and accordingly he suffered the penalty of his ‘ forward pen ’ ,<span corresp="#note19" type="note_anchor">[ 19 ]</span>and was severely neglected by King and Court . Throughout James 's reign a darker and more satirical mood possesses Drayton , intruding at times even into his strenuous recreation-ground , the Polyolbion , and manifesting itself more directly in his satires , the Owle ( 1604 ) , the Moon-Calfe ( 1627 ) , the Man in the Moone ( 1606 ) , and his verse-letters and elegies ; while his disappointment with the times , the country , and the King , flashes out occasionally even in the Odes , and is heard in his last publication , the Muses Elizium ( 1630 ) . To counterbalance the disappointment in his hopes from the King , Drayton found a new and life-long friend in Walter Aston , of Tixall , in Staffordshire ; this gentleman was created Knight of the Bath by James , and made Drayton one of his esquires . By Aston 's ‘ continual bounty ’ the poet was able to devote himself almost entirely to more congenial literary work ; for , while Meres speaks of the Polyolbion in 1598 ,<span corresp="#note20" type="note_anchor">[ 20 ]</span>and we may easily see that Drayton had the idea of that work at least as early as 1594 ,<span corresp="#note21" type="note_anchor">[ 21 ]</span>yet he cannot have been able to give much time to it till now . Nevertheless , the ‘ declining and corrupt times ’ worked on Drayton 's mind and grieved and darkened his soul , for we must remember that he was perfectly prosperous then and was not therefore incited to satire by bodily want or distress .</p>
    <p n="10">In 1604 he published the Owle , a mild satire , under the form of a moral fable of government , reminding the reader a little of the Parlement of Foules . The Man in the Moone ( 1606 ) is partly a recension of Endimion and Phoebe , but is a heterogeneous mass of weakly satire , of no particular merit . The Moon-Calfe ( 1627 ) is Drayton 's most savage and misanthropic excursion into the region of Satire ; in which , though occasionally nobly ironic , he is more usually coarse and blustering , in the style of Marston .<span corresp="#note22" type="note_anchor">[ 22 ]</span>In 1605 Drayton brought out his first ‘ collected poems ’ , from which the Eclogues and the Owle are omitted ; and in 1606 he published his Poemes Lyrick and Pastorall , Odes , Eglogs , The Man in the Moone . Of these the Eglogs are a recension of the Shepherd 's Garland of 1593 : we have already spoken of The Man in the Moone . The Odes are by far the most important and striking feature of the book . In the preface , Drayton professes to be following Pindar , Anacreon , and Horace , though , as he modestly implies , at a great distance . Under the title of Odes he includes a variety of subjects , and a variety of metres ; ranging from an Ode to his Harp or to his Criticks , to a Ballad of Agincourt , or a poem on the Rose compared with his Mistress . In the edition of 1619 appeared several more Odes , including some of the best ; while many of the others underwent careful revision , notably the Ballad . ‘ Sing wee the Rose , ’ perhaps because of its unintelligibility , and the Ode to his friend John Savage , perhaps because too closely imitated from Horace , were omitted . Drayton was not the first to use the term Ode for a lyrical poem , in English : Soothern in 1584 , and Daniel in 1592 had preceded him ; but he was the first to give the name popularity in England , and to lift the kind as Ronsard had lifted it in France ; and till the time of Cowper no other English poet showed mastery of the short , staccato measure of the Anacreontic as distinct from the Pindaric Ode . In the Odes Drayton shows to the fullest extent his metrical versatility : he touches the Skeltonic metre , the long ten-syllabled line of the Sacrifice to Apollo ; and ascends from the smooth and melodious rhythms of the New Year through the inspiring harp-tones of the Virginian Voyage to the clangour and swing of the Ballad of Agincourt . His grammar is possibly more distorted here than anywhere , but , as Mr. Elton says , ‘ these are the obstacles of any poet who uses measures of four or six syllables . ’ His tone throughout is rather that of the harp , as played , perhaps , in Polesworth Hall , than that of any other instrument ; but in 1619 Drayton has taken to him the lute of Carew and his compeers . In 1619 the style is lighter , the fancy gayer , more exquisite , more recondite . Most of his few metaphysical conceits are to be found in these later Odes , as in the Heart , the Valentine , and the Crier . In the comparison of the two editions the nobler , if more strained , tone of the earlier is obvious ; it is still Elizabethan , in its nobility of ideal and purpose , in its enthusiasm , in its belief and confidence in England and her men ; and this even though we catch a glimpse of the Jacobean woe in the Ode to John Savage : the 1619 Odes are of a different world ; their spirit is lighter , more insouciant in appearance , though perhaps studiedly so ; the rhythms are more fantastic , with less of strength and firmness , though with more of grace and superficial beauty ; even the very textual alterations , while usually increasing the grace and the music of the lines , remind the reader that something of the old spontaneity and freshness is gone .</p>
    <p n="11">In 1607 and 1609 , Drayton published two editions of the last and weakest of his mediaeval poems — the Legend of Great Cromwell ; and for the next few years he produced nothing new , only attending to the publication of certain reprints and new editions . During this time , however , he was working steadily at the Polyolbion , helped by the patronage of Aston and of Prince Henry . In 1612-13 , Drayton burst upon an indifferent world with the first part of the great poem , containing eighteen songs ; the title-page will give the best idea of the contents and plan of the book : ‘ Poly-Olbion or a Chorographicall Description of the Tracts , Riuers , Mountaines , Forests , and other Parts of this renowned Isle of Great Britaine , With intermixture of the most Remarquable Stories , Antiquities , Wonders , Rarityes , Pleasures , and Commodities of the same : Digested in a Poem by Michael Drayton , Esq . With a Table added , for direction to those occurrences of Story and Antiquities , whereunto the Course of the Volume easily leades not . ’ &amp; c. On this work Drayton had been engaged for nearly the whole of his poetical career . The learning and research displayed in the poem are extraordinary , almost equalling the erudition of Selden in his Annotations to each Song . The first part was , for various reasons , a drug in the market , and Drayton found great difficulty in securing a publisher for the second part . But during the years from 1613 to 1622 , he became acquainted with Drummond of Hawthornden through a common friend , Sir William Alexander of Menstry , afterwards Earl of Stirling . In 1618 , Drayton starts a correspondence ; and towards the end of the year mentions that he is corresponding also with Andro Hart , bookseller , of Edinburgh . The subject of his letter was probably the publication of the Second Part ; which Drayton alludes to in a letter of 1619 thus : ‘ I have done twelve books more , that is from the eighteenth book , which was Kent , if you note it ; all the East part and North to the river Tweed ; but it lies by me ; for the booksellers and I are in terms ; they are a company of base knaves , whom I both scorn and kick at . ’ Finally , in 1622 , Drayton got Marriott , Grismand , and Dewe , of London , to take the work , and it was published with a dedication to Prince Charles , who , after his brother 's death , had given Drayton patronage . Drayton 's preface to the Second Part is well worth quoting :</p>
    <p n="12">‘ To any that will read it . When I first undertook this Poem , or , as some very skilful in this kind have pleased to term it , this Herculean labour , I was by some virtuous friends persuaded , that I should receive much comfort and encouragement therein ; and for these reasons ; First , that it was a new , clear , way , never before gone by any ; then , that it contained all the Delicacies , Delights , and Rarities of this renowned Isle , interwoven with the Histories of the Britons , Saxons , Normans , and the later English : And further that there is scarcely any of the Nobility or Gentry of this land , but that he is in some way or other by his Blood interested therein . But it hath fallen out otherwise ; for instead of that comfort , which my noble friends ( from the freedom of their spirits ) proposed as my due , I have met with barbarous ignorance , and base detraction ; such a cloud hath the Devil drawn over the world 's judgment , whose opinion is in few years fallen so far below all ballatry , that the lethargy is incurable : nay , some of the Stationers , that had the selling of the First Part of this Poem , because it went not so fast away in the sale , as some of their beastly and abominable trash , ( a shame both to our language and nation ) have either despitefully left out , or at least carelessly neglected the Epistles to the Readers , and so have cozened the buyers with unperfected books ; which these that have undertaken the Second Part , have been forced to amend in the First , for the small number that are yet remaining in their hands . And some of our outlandish , unnatural , English , ( I know not how otherwise to express them ) stick not to say that there is nothing in this Island worth studying for , and take a great pride to be ignorant in any thing thereof ; for these , since they delight in their folly , I wish it may be hereditary from them to their posterity , that their children may be begg 'd for fools to the fifth generation , until it may be beyond the memory of man to know that there was ever other of their families : neither can this deter me from going on with Scotland , if means and time do not hinder me , to perform as much as I have promised in my First Song :</p>
    <p n="13">Till through the sleepy main , to Thuly I have gone , And seen the Frozen Isles , the cold Deucalidon , Amongst whose iron Rocks , grim Saturn yet remains Bound in those gloomy caves with adamantine chains .</p>
    <p n="14">And as for those cattle whereof I spake before , Odi profanum vulgus , et arceo , of which I account them , be they never so great , and so I leave them . To my friends , and the lovers of my labours , I wish all happiness . Michael Drayton . ’</p>
    <p n="15">The Polyolbion as a whole is easy and pleasant to read ; and though in some parts it savours too much of a mere catalogue , yet it has many things truly poetical . The best books are perhaps the xiij , xiv , and xv , where he is on his own ground , and therefore naturally at his best . It is interesting to notice how much attention and space he devotes to Wales . He describes not only the ‘ wonders ’ but also the fauna and flora of each district ; and of the two it would seem that the flowers interested him more . Though he was a keen observer of country sights and sounds ( a fact sufficiently attested by the Nymphidia and the Nymphals ) , it is evident that his interest in most things except flowers was rather momentary or conventional than continuous and heart-felt ; but of the flowers he loves to talk , whether he weaves us a garland for the Thame 's wedding , or gives us the contents of a maund of simples ; and his love , if somewhat homely and unimaginative , is apparent enough . But the main inspiration , as it is the main theme , of the Polyolbion is the glory and might and wealth , past , present , and future , of England , her possessions and her folk . Through all this glory , however , we catch the tone of Elizabethan sorrow over the ‘ Ruines of Time ’ ; grief that all these mighty men and their works will perish and be forgotten , unless the poet makes them live for ever on the lips of men . Drayton 's own voluminousness has defeated his purpose , and sunk his poem by its own bulk . Though it is difficult to go so far as Mr. Bullen , and say that the only thing better than a stroll in the Polyolbion is one in a Sussex lane , it is still harder to agree with Canon Beeching , that ‘ there are few beauties on the road ’ , the beauties are many , though of a quietly rural type , and the road , if long and winding , is of good surface , while its cranks constitute much of its charm . It is doubtless , from the outside , an appalling poem in these days of epitomes and monographs , but it certainly deserves to be rescued from oblivion and read .</p>
    <p n="16">In 1618 Drayton contributed two Elegies to Henry FitzGeoffrey 's Satyrs and Epigrames . These were on the Lady Penelope Clifton , and on ‘ the death of the three sonnes of the Lord Sheffield , drowned neere where Trent falleth into Humber ’ . Neither is remarkable save for far-fetched conceits ; they were reprinted in 1610 , and again , with many others , in the volume of 1627 . In 1619 Drayton issued a folio collected edition of his works , and reprinted it in 1620 . In 1627 followed a folio of wholly fresh matter , including the Battaile of Agincourt ; the Miseries of Queene Margarite , Nimphidia , Quest of Cinthia , Shepheards Sirena , Moone-Calfe , and Elegies upon sundry occasions . The Battaile of Agincourt is a somewhat otiose expansion , with purple patches , of the Ballad ; it is , nevertheless , Drayton 's best lengthy piece on a historical theme . Of the Miseries of Queene Margarite and of the Moone-Calfe we have already spoken . The most notable piece in the book is the Nimphidia . This poem of the Court of Fairy has ‘ invention , grace , and humour ’ , as Canon Beeching has said . It would be interesting to know exactly when it was composed and committed to paper , for it is thought that the three fairy poems in Herrick 's Hesperides were written about 1626 . In any case , Drayton 's poem touches very little , and chiefly in the beginning , on the subject of any one of Herrick 's three pieces . The style , execution , and impression left on the reader are quite different ; even as they are totally unlike those of the Midsummer Night 's Dream . Herrick 's pieces are extraordinary combinations of the idea of ‘ King of Shadows ’ , with a reality fantastically sober : the poems are steeped in moonlight . In Drayton all is clear day , or the most unromantic of nights ; though everything is charming , there is no attempt at idealization , little of the higher faculty of imagination ; but great realism , and much play of fancy . Herrick 's verses were written by Cobweb and Moth together , Drayton 's by Puck . Granting , however , the initial deficiency in subtlety of charm , the whole poem is inimitably graceful and piquant . The gay humour , the demure horror of the witchcraft , the terrible seriousness of the battle , wonderfully realize the mock-heroic gigantesque ; and while there is not the minute accuracy of Gulliver in Lilliput , Drayton did not write for a sceptical or too-prying audience ; quite half his readers believed more or less in fairies . In the metre of the poem Drayton again echoes that of the older romances , as he did in Dowsabel . In the Quest of Cinthia , while ostensibly we come to the real world of mortals , we are really in a non-existent land of pastoral convention , in the most pseudo-Arcadian atmosphere in which Drayton ever worked . The metre and the language are , however , charmingly managed . The Shepheards Sirena is a poem , apparently , ‘ where more is meant than meets the ear , ’ as so often in pastoral poetry<span corresp="#note23" type="note_anchor">[ 23 ]</span>; it is difficult to see exactly what is meant ; but the Jacobean strain of doubt and fear is there , and the poem would seem to have been written some time earlier than 1627 . The Elegies comprise a great variety of styles and themes ; some are really threnodies , some verse-letters , some laments over the evil times , and one a summary of Drayton 's literary opinions . He employs the couplet in his Elegies with a masterly hand , often with a deliberately rugged effect , as in his broader Marstonic satire addressed to William Browne ; while the line of greater smoothness but equal strength is to be seen in the letters to Sandys and Jeffreys . He is fantastic and conceited in most of the threnodies ; but , as is natural , that on his old friend , Sir Henry Rainsford , is least artificial and fullest of true feeling . The epistle to Henery Reynolds . Of Poets and Poesie shows Drayton as a sane and sagacious critic , ready to see the good , but keen to discern the weakness also ; perhaps the clearest evidence of his critical skill is the way in which nearly all of his judgements on his contemporaries coincide with the received modern opinions .</p>
    <p n="17">In his later years Drayton enjoyed the patronage of the third Earl and Countess of Dorset ; and in 1630 he published his last volume , the Muses Elizium , of which he dedicated the pastoral part to the Earl , and the three divine poems at the end to the Countess . The Muses Elizium proper consists of Ten Pastorals or Nymphals , prefaced by a Description of Elizium . The three divine poems have been mentioned before , and were Noah 's Floud , Moses his Birth and Miracles , and David and Goliah . The Nymphals are the crown and summary of much of the best in Drayton 's work . Here he departed from the conventional type of pastoral , even more than in the Shepherd 's Garland ; but to say that he sang of English rustic life would hardly be true : the sixth Nymphal , allowing for a few pardonable exaggerations by the competitors , is almost all English , if we except the names ; so is the tenth with the same exception ; the first and fourth might take place anywhere , but are not likely in any country ; the second is more conventional ; the fifth is almost , but not quite , English ; the third , seventh , and ninth are avowedly classical in theme ; while the eighth is a more delicate and subtle fairy poem than the Nymphidia . The fourth and tenth Nymphals are also touched with the sadder , almost satiric vein ; the former inveighing against the English imitation of foreigners and love of extravagance in dress ; while the tenth complains of the improvident and wasteful felling of trees in the English forests . This last Nymphal , though designedly an epilogue , is probably rather a warning than a despairing lament , even though we conceive the old satyr to be Drayton himself . As a whole the Nymphals show Drayton at his happiest and lightest in style and metre ; at his moments of greatest serenity and even gaiety ; an atmosphere of sunshine seems to envelope them all , though the sun sink behind a cloud in the last . His music now is that of a rippling stream , whereas in his earlier days he spoke weightier and more sonorous words , with a mouth of gold .<span corresp="#note24" type="note_anchor">[ 24 ]</span></p>
    <p n="18">To estimate the poetical faculty of Drayton is a somewhat perplexing task ; for , while rarely subtle , or rising to empyrean heights , he wrote in such varied styles , on such various themes , that the task , at first , seems that of criticizing many poets , not one . But through all his work runs the same eminently English spirit , the same honesty and clearness of idea , the same stolidity of purpose , and not infrequently of execution also ; the same enthusiasm characterizes all his earlier , and much of his later work ; the enthusiasm especially characteristic of Elizabethan England , and shown by Drayton in his passion for England and the English , in his triumphant joy in their splendid past , and his certainty of their future glory . As a poet , he lacked imagination and fine fury ; he supplied their place by the airiest and clearest of fancies , by the strenuous labour of a great brain illumined by the steady flame of love for his country and for his lady . Mr. Courthope has said that he lacked loftiness and resolution of artistic purpose ; without these , we ask , how could a man , not lavishly dowered with poetry in his soul , have achieved so much of it ? It was his very fixity and loftiness of purpose , his English stubbornness and doggedness of resolution that enabled him to surmount so many obstacles of style and metre , of subject and thought . His two purposes , of glorifying his mistress and his friends , and of sounding England 's glories past and future , while insisting on the dangers of a present decadence , never flagged or failed . All his poetry up to 1627 has this object directly or secondarily ; and much after this date . Of the more abstract and universal aspects of his art he had not much conception ; but he caught eagerly at the fashionable belief in the eternizing power of poetry ; and had it not been that , where his patriotism was uppermost , he was deficient in humour and sense of proportion , he would have succeeded better : as it is , his more directly patriotic pieces are usually the dullest or longest of his works . He requires , like all other poets , the impulse of an absolutely personal and individual feeling , a moment of more intimate sympathy , to rouse him to his heights of song . Thus the Ballad of Agincourt is on the very theme of all patriotic themes that most attracted him ; Virginian and other Voyages lay very close to his heart ; and in certain sonnets to his lady lies his only imperishable work . Of sheer melody and power of song he had little , apart from his themes : he could not have sat down and written a few lark 's or nightingale 's notes about nothing as some of his contemporaries were able to do : he required the stimulus of a subject , and if he were really moved thereby he beat the music out . Only in one or two of the later Odes , and in the volumes of 1627 and 1630 , does his music ever seem to flow from him naturally . Akin to this quality of broad and extensive workmanship , to this faculty of taking a subject and when writing , with all thought concentrated on it , rather than on the method of writing about it , is his strange lack of what are usually called ‘ quotations ’ . For this is not only due to the fact that he is little known ; there are , besides , so few detached remarks or aphorisms that are separately quotable ; so few examples of that curiosa felicitas of diction : lines like these ,</p>
    <p n="19">Thy Bowe , halfe broke , is peec 'd with old desire ; Her Bowe is beauty with ten thousand strings ....</p>
    <p n="20">are rare enough . Drayton , in fact , comes as near controverting the statement Poeta nascitur , non fit , as any one in English literature : by diligent toil and earnest desire he won a place for himself in the second rank of English poets : through love he once set foot in the circle of the mightiest . Sincere he was always , simple often , sensuous rarely . His great industry , his careful study , and his great receptivity are shown in the unusual spectacle of a man who has sung well in the language of his youth , suddenly learning , in his age , the tongue spoken by the younger generation , and reproducing it with individuality and sureness of touch . It is in rhetoric , splendid or rugged , in argument , in plain statement or description , in the outline sketch of a picture , that Drayton excels ; magic of atmosphere and colouring are rarely present . Stolidity is , perhaps , his besetting sin ; yet it is the sign of a slow , not a dull , intellect ; an intellect , like his heart , which never let slip what it had once taken to itself .</p>
    <p n="21">As a man Drayton would seem to have been an excellent type of the sturdy , clear-headed , but yet romantic and enthusiastic Englishman ; gifted with much natural ability , sedulously increased by study ; quietly humorous , self-restrained ; and if temporarily soured by disappointment and the disjointed times , yet emerging at last into a greater serenity , a more unadulterated gaiety than had ever before characterized him . It is possible , but from his clear and sane balance of mind improbable , that many of his light later poems are due to deliberate self-blinding and self-deception , a walking in enchanted lands of the mind .</p>
    <p n="22">Of Drayton 's three known portraits the earliest shows him at the age of thirty-six , and is now in the National Portrait Gallery . A look of quiet , speculative melancholy seems to pervade it ; there is , as yet , no moroseness , no evidence of severe conflict with the world , no shadow of stress or of doubt . The second and best-known portrait shows us Drayton at the age of fifty , and was engraved by Hole , as a frontispiece to the poems of 1619 . Here a notable change has come over the face ; the mouth is hardened , and depressed at the corners through disappointment and disillusionment ; the eyes are full of a pathos increased by the puzzled and perturbed uplift of the brows . Yet a stubbornness and tenacity of purpose invests the features and reminds us that Drayton is of the old and sound Elizabethan stock , ‘ on evil days though fallen . ’ Let it be remembered , that he was in 1613 , when the portrait was taken , in more or less prosperous circumstances ; it was the sad degeneracy , the meanness and feebleness of the generation around him , that chiefly depressed and embittered him . The final portrait , now in the Dulwich Gallery , represents the poet as a man of sixty-five ; and is quite in keeping with the sunnier and calmer tone of his later poetry . It is the face of one who has not emerged unscathed from the world 's conflict , but has attained to a certain calm , a measure of tranquillity , a portion of content , who has learnt the lesson that there is a soul of goodness in things evil . The Hole portrait shows him with long hair , small ‘ goatee ’ beard , and aquiline nose drawn up at the nostrils : while the National portrait shows a type of nose and beard intermediate between the Hole and the Dulwich pictures : the general contour of the face , though the forehead is broad enough , is long and oval . Drayton seems to have been tall and thin , and to have been very susceptible of cold , and therefore to have hated Winter and the North .<span corresp="#note25" type="note_anchor">[ 25 ]</span>He is said to have shared in the supper which caused Shakespeare 's death ; but his own verses<span corresp="#note26" type="note_anchor">[ 26 ]</span>breathe the spirit of Milton 's sonnet to Cyriack Skinner , rather than that of a devotee of Bacchus .</p>
    <p n="23">He died in 1631 , possibly on December 23 , and was buried under the North wall of Westminster Abbey . Meres 's<span corresp="#note27" type="note_anchor">[ 27 ]</span>opinion of his character during his early life is as follows : ‘ As Aulus Persius Flaccus is reported among al writers to be of an honest life and vpright conuersation : so Michael Drayton , quem totics honoris et amoris causa nomino , among schollers , souldiours , Poets , and all sorts of people is helde for a man of uertuous disposition , honest conversation , and well gouerned cariage ; which is almost miraculous among good wits in these declining and corrupt times , when there is nothing but rogery in villanous man , and when cheating and craftines is counted the cleanest wit , and soundest wisedome . '[ 28 ] Fuller also , in a similar strain , says , ‘ He was a pious poet , his conscience having the command of his fancy , very temperate in his life , slow of speech , and inoffensive in company . ’</p>
    <p n="24">In conclusion I have to thank Mr. H. M. Sanders , of Pembroke College , Oxford , for help and advice , and Professor Raleigh and Mr. R. W . Chapman for help and criticism while the volume was in the press . Above all , I am at every turn indebted to Professor Elton 's invaluable Michael Drayton ,<span corresp="#note29" type="note_anchor">[ 29 ]</span>without which the work of any student of Drayton would be rendered , if not impossible , at least infinitely harder .</p>

    <head>APPENDIX</head>
    <p n="1">In this Appendix , I have collected certain fugitive pieces of Drayton 's ; chiefly commendatory verses prefixed to various friends ’ books . The first song is from England 's Helicon , and is , I think , too pretty to be lost . Three of the commendatory poems are in sonnet-form , and their inclusion brings us nearer the whole number published by Drayton ; of which there are doubtless a few still lacking . But I have tried to make the collection of sonnets as complete as possible .</p>
    <p n="2">From England 's Helicon ( 1600 ) p. 97 .</p>
    <p n="3">Rowlands Madrigall .</p>
    <p n="4">Faire Loue rest thee heere , Neuer yet was morne so cleere , Sweete be not vnkinde , Let me thy fauour finde , Or else for loue I die .</p>
    <p n="5">Harke this pretty bubling spring , How it makes the Meadowes ring , Loue now stand my friend , Heere let all sorrow end , And I will honour thee . 10</p>
    <p n="6">See where little Cupid lyes , Looking babies in her eyes . Cupid helpe me now , Lend to me thy bowe , To wound her that wounded me .</p>
    <p n="7">Heere is none to see or tell , All our flocks are feeding by , This Banke with Roses spred , Oh it is a dainty bed , Fit for my Loue and me . 20</p>
    <p n="8">Harke the birds in yonder Groaue , How they chaunt vnto my Loue , Loue be kind to me , As I haue beene to thee , For thou hast wonne my hart .</p>
    <p n="9">Calme windes blow you faire , Rock her thou gentle ayre , O the morne is noone , The euening comes too soone , To part my Loue and me . 30</p>
    <p n="10">The Roses and thy lips doo meete , Oh that life were halfe so sweete , Who would respect his breath , That might die such a death , Oh that life thus might die .</p>
    <p n="11">All the bushes that be neere , With sweet Nightingales beset , Hush sweete and be still , Let them sing their fill , There 's none our ioyes to let . 40</p>
    <p n="12">Sunne why doo'st thou goe so fast ? Oh why doo'st thou make such hast ? It is too early yet , So soone from ioyes to flit Why art thou so vnkind ?</p>
    <p n="13">See my little Lambkins runne , Looke on them till I haue done , Hast not on the night , To rob me of her light , That liue but by her eyes . 50</p>
    <p n="14">Alas , sweete Loue , we must depart , Harke , my dogge begins to barke , Some bodie 's comming neere , They shall not find vs heere , For feare of being chid .</p>
    <p n="15">Take my Garland and my Gloue , Weare it for my sake my Loue , To morrow on the greene , Thou shalt be our Sheepheards Queene , Crowned with Roses gay . 60</p>

   <note>FINIS . From T. Morley 's First Book of Ballets ( 1595 ) . Mr. M. D . to the Author . Such was old Orpheus cunning , That sencelesse things drew neere him , And heards of beasts to heare him , The stock , the stone , the Oxe , the Asse came running , Morley ! but this enchaunting To thee , to be the Musick-God is wanting . And yet thou needst not feare him ; Draw thou the Shepherds still and Bonny lasses , And enuie him not stocks , stones , Oxen , Asses . Prefixed to Christopher Middleton 's Legend of Humphrey Duke of Gloucester ( 1600 ) . To his friend , Master Chr . M. his Booke . Like as a man , on some aduenture bound His honest friendes , their kindnes to expresse , T'incourage him of whome the maine is own 'd ; Some venture more , and some aduenture lesse , That if the voyage ( happily ) be good : They his good fortune freely may pertake ; If otherwise it perrish in the flood , Yet like good friends theirs perish 'd for his sake . On thy returne I put this little forth , My chaunce with thine indifferently to proue , Which though ( I know ) not fitting with thy worth , Accept it yet since it proceedes from loue ; And if thy fortune prosper , I may see I haue some share , though most returne to thee . Mich. Drayton . Prefixed to John Davies of Hereford ; Holy Roode ( 1609 ) . To M. IOHN DAVIES , my good friend . Such men as hold intelligence with Letters , And in that nice and Narrow way of Verse , As oft they lend , so oft they must be Debters , If with the Muses they will haue commerce : Seldome at Stawles , me , this way men rehearse , To mine Inferiours , not unto my Betters : He stales his Lines that so doeth them disperse ; I am so free , I loue not Golden-fetters . And many Lines fore Writers , be but Setters To them which cheate with Papers ; which doth pierse , Our Credits : when we shew our selues Abetters : To those that wrong our knowledge : we rehearse Often ( my good Iohn ; and I loue ) thy Letters ; Which lend me Credit , as I lend my Verse . Michael Drayton . Prefixed to Sir David Murray 's Sophonisba &amp; c. ( 1611 ) . To my kinde friend Da : Murray . In new attire ( and put most neatly on ) Thou Murray mak'st thy passionate Queene apeare , As when she sat on the Numidian throne , Deck 'd with those Gems that most refulgent were . So thy stronge muse her maker like repaires , That from the ruins of her wasted vrne , Into a body of delicious ayres : Againe her spirit doth transmigrated turne , That scortching soile which thy great subiect bore , Bred those that coldly but exprest her merit , But breathing now vpon our colder shore , Here shee hath found a noble fiery spirit , Both there , and here , so fortunate for Fame , That what she was , she 's euery where the same . M. DRAYTON . Among the Panegyrical Verses before Coryat 's Crudities ( 1611 ) . Incipit Michael Drayton . A briefe Prologue to the verses following . Deare Tom , thy booke was like to come to light , Ere I could gaine but one halfe howre to write ; They go before whose wits are at their noones , And I come after bringing Salt and Spoones . Many there be that write before thy Booke , For whom ( except here ) who could euer looke ? Thrice happy are all wee that had the Grace To haue our names set in this liuing place . Most worthy man , with thee it is euen thus , As men take Dottrels , so hast thou ta'n vs . Which as a man his arme or leg doth set , So this fond Bird will likewise counterfeit : Thou art the Fowler , and doest shew vs shapes And we are all thy Zanies , thy true Apes . 10 I saw this age ( from what it was at first ) Swolne , and so bigge , that it was like to burst , Growne so prodigious , so quite out of fashion , That who will thriue , must hazard his damnation : Sweating in panges , sent such a horrid mist , As to dim heauen : I looked for Antichrist Or some new set of Diuels to sway hell , Worser then those , that in the Chaos fell : Wondring what fruit it to the world would bring , At length it brought forth this : O most strange thing ; 20 And with sore throwes , for that the greatest head Euer is hard'st to be deliuered . By thee wise Coryate we are taught to know , Great , with great men which is the way to grow . For in a new straine thou com'st finely in , Making thy selfe like those thou mean'st to winne : Greatnesse to me seem 'd euer full of feare , Which thou found'st false at thy arriuing there , Of the Bermudas , the example such , Where not a ship vntill this time durst touch ; 30 Kep't as suppos 'd by hels infernall dogs , Our Fleet found their most honest wyld courteous hogs . Liue vertuous Coryate , and for euer be Lik 'd of such wise men , as are most like thee . Explicit Michael Drayton . Prefixed to William Browne 's Britannia 's Pastorals ( 1613 ) . To his Friend the AVTHOR . Driue forth thy Flocke , young Pastor , to that Plaine , Where our old Shepheards wont their flocks to feed ; To those cleare walkes , where many a skilfull Swaine To'ards the calme eu'ning , tun 'd his pleasant Reede , Those , to the Muses once so sacred , Downes , As no rude foote might there presume to stand : ( Now made the way of the vnworthiest Clownes , Dig 'd and plow 'd vp with each vnhallowed hand ) If possible thou canst , redeeme those places , Where , by the brim of many a siluer Spring , 10 The learned Maydens , and delightfull Graces Often haue sate to heare our Shepheards sing : Where on those Pines the neighb'ring Groues among , ( Now vtterly neglected in these dayes ) Our Garlands , Pipes , and Cornamutes were hong The monuments of our deserued praise . So may thy Sheepe like , so thy Lambes increase , And from the Wolfe feede euer safe and free ! So maist thou thriue , among the learned prease , As thou young Shepheard art belou 'd of mee ! 20 Prefixed to Chapman 's Translation of Hesiod 's Georgics ( 1618 ) . To my worthy friend Mr. George Chapman , and his translated Hesiod . Chapman ; We finde by thy past-prized fraught , What wealth thou dost vpon this Land conferre ; Th'olde Grecian Prophets hither that hast brought , Of their full words the true interpreter : And by thy trauell , strongly hast exprest The large dimensions of the English tongue ; Deliuering them so well , the first and best , That to the world in Numbers euer sung . Thou hast vnlock 'd the treasury , wherein All Art , and knowledge haue so long been hidden : 10 Which , till the gracefull Muses did begin Here to inhabite , was to vs forbidden . In blest Elizivm ( in a place most fit ) Vnder that tree due to the Delphian God , Musæus , and that Iliad Singer sit , And neare to them that noble Hesiod , Smoothing their rugged foreheads ; and do smile , After so many hundred yeares to see Their Poems read in this farre westerne Ile , Translated from their ancient Greeke , by thee ; 20 Each his good Genius whispering in his eare , That with so lucky , and auspicious fate Did still attend them , whilst they liuing were , And gaue their Verses such a lasting date . Where slightly passing by the Thespian spring , Many long after did but onely sup ; Nature , then fruitfull , forth these men did bring , To fetch deep Rowses from Ioues plentious cup . In thy free labours ( friend ) then rest content , Feare not Detraction , neither fawne on Praise : 30 When idle Censure all her force hath spent , Knowledge can crowne her self with her owne Baies . Their Lines , that haue so many liues outworne , Cleerely expounded shall base Enuy scorne . Michael Drayton . Prefixed to Book ij . of Primaleon , &amp; c. Translated by Anthony Munday ( 1619 ) . OF THE WORKE and Translation . If in opinion of iudiciall wit , Primaleons sweet Invention well deserue : Then he ( no lesse ) which hath translated it , Which doth his sense , his forme , his phrase , obserue . And in true method of his home-borne stile , ( Following the fashion of a French conceate ) Hath brought him heere into this famous Ile , Where but a stranger , now hath made his seate . He liues a Prince , and comming in this sort , Shall to his Countrey of your fame report . M. D . From Annalia Dubrensia ( 1636 ) .</note>

    <p>TO MY NOBLE Friend Mr. ROBERT DOVER , on his braue annuall Assemblies vpon Cotswold . Douer , to doe thee Right , who will not striue , That dost in these dull yron Times reuiue The golden Ages glories ; which poore Wee Had not so much as dream't on but for Thee ? As those braue Grecians in their happy dayes , On Mount Olympus to their Hercules Ordain 'd their games Olimpick , and so nam 'd Of that great Mountaine ; for those pastimes fam 'd : Where then their able Youth , Leapt , Wrestled , Ran , Threw the arm 'd Dart ; and honour 'd was the Man 10 That was the Victor ; In the Circute there The nimble Rider , and skill 'd Chariotere Stroue for the Garland ; In those noble Times There to their Harpes the Poets sang their Rimes ; That whilst Greece flourisht , and was onely then Nurse of all Arts , and of all famous men : Numbring their yeers , still their accounts they made , Either from this or that Olimpiade . So Douer , from these Games , by thee begun , Wee'l reckon Ours , as time away doth run . 20 Wee'l haue thy Statue in some Rocke cut out , With braue Inscriptions garnished about ; And vnder written , Loe , this was the man , DOVER , that first these noble Sports began . Ladds of the Hills , and Lasses of the Vale , In many a song , and many a merry Tale Shall mention Thee ; and hauing leaue to play , Vnto thy name shall make a Holy day . The Cosswold Shepheards as their flockes they keepe , To put off lazie drowsinesse and sleepe , 30 Shall sit to tell , and heare thy Story tould , That night shall come ere they their flocks can fould . Michaell Drayton .</p>

    <head>NOTES</head>
    <p n="17">These notes are not intended to supply materials for the criticism of the text . So freely , indeed , did Drayton alter his poems for a fresh edition , that the ordinary machinery of an apparatus criticus would be overtasked if the attempt were made . All that has been undertaken here is to provide the requisite information in places where the text followed seemed open to suspicion .</p>
    <p n="18">It may be added that the punctuation of the originals has in general been preserved ; in a few flagrant instances , where the text as it stood was misleading , it has been modified . Such changes are not noted here .</p>
