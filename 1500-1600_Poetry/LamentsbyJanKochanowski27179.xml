    <p>UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SYLLABUS SERIES NO . 122 INTRODUCTORY NOTE Jan Kochanowski ( 1530-84 ) was the greatest poet of Poland during its existence as an independent kingdom . His Laments are his masterpiece , the choicest work of Polish lyric poetry before the time of Mickiewicz . Kochanowski was a learned poet of the Renaissance , drawing his inspiration from the literatures of Greece and Rome . He was also a man of sincere piety , famous for his translation of the Psalms into his native language . In his Laments , written in memory of his little daughter Ursula , who died in 1579 at the age of thirty months , he expresses the deepest personal emotion through the medium of a literary style that had been developed by long years of study . The Laments , to be sure , are not based on any classic model and they contain few direct imitations of the classical poets , though it may be noted that the concluding couplet of Lament XV is translated from the Greek Anthology . On the other hand they are interspersed with continual references to classic story ; and , more important , are filled with the atmosphere of the Stoic philosophy , derived from Cicero and Seneca . And along with this austere teaching there runs through them a warmer tone of Christian hope and trust ; Lament XVIII is in spirit a psalm . To us of today , however , these poems appeal less by their formal perfection , by their learning , or by their religious tone , than by their exquisite humanity . Kochanowski 's sincerity of grief , his fatherly love for his baby girl , after more than three centuries have not lost their power to touch our hearts . In the Laments Kochanowski embodied a wholesome ideal of life such as animated the finest spirits of Poland in the years of its greatest glory , a spirit both humanistic and universally human . G. R.

    <head>LAMENT I</head>
     <l n="1">Come , Heraclitus and Simonides ,</l>
     <l n="2">Come with your weeping and sad elegies :</l>
     <l n="3">Ye griefs and sorrows , come from all the lands</l>
     <l n="4">Wherein ye sigh and wail and wring your hands :</l>
     <l n="5">Gather ye here within my house today</l>
     <l n="6">And help me mourn my sweet , whom in her May</l>
     <l n="7">Ungodly Death hath ta'en to his estate ,</l>
     <l n="8">Leaving me on a sudden desolate .</l>
     <l n="9">‘ Tis so a serpent glides on some shy nest</l>
     <l n="10">And , of the tiny nightingales possessed ,</l>
     <l n="11">Doth glut its throat , though , frenzied with her fear ,</l>
     <l n="12">The mother bird doth beat and twitter near</l>
     <l n="13">And strike the monster , till it turns and gapes</l>
     <l n="14">To swallow her , and she but just escapes .</l>
     <l n="15">“ ‘ Tis vain to weep , ” my friends perchance will say .</l>
     <l n="16">Dear God , is aught in life not vain , then ? Nay ,</l>
     <l n="17">Seek to lie soft , yet thorns will prickly be :</l>
     <l n="18">The life of man is naught but vanity .</l>
     <l n="19">Ah , which were better , then — to seek relief</l>
     <l n="20">In tears , or sternly strive to conquer grief ?</l>

    <head>LAMENT II</head>
     <l n="1">If I had ever thought to write in praise</l>
     <l n="2">Of little children and their simple ways ,</l>
     <l n="3">Far rather had I fashioned cradle verse</l>
     <l n="4">To rock to slumber , or the songs a nurse</l>
     <l n="5">Might croon above the baby on her breast .</l>
     <l n="6">Setting her charge 's short-lived woes at rest .</l>
     <l n="7">For much more useful are such trifling tasks</l>
     <l n="8">Than that which sad misfortune this day asks :</l>
     <l n="9">To weep o'er thy deaf grave , dear maiden mine .</l>
     <l n="10">And wail the harshness of grim Proserpine .</l>
     <l n="11">But now I have no choice of subject : then</l>
     <l n="12">I shunned a theme scarce fitting riper men ,</l>
     <l n="13">And now disaster drives me on by force</l>
     <l n="14">To songs unheeded by the great concourse</l>
     <l n="15">Of mortals . Verses that I would not sing</l>
     <l n="16">The living , to the dead I needs must bring .</l>
     <l n="17">Yet though I dry the marrow from my bones ,</l>
     <l n="18">Weeping another 's death , my grief atones</l>
     <l n="19">No whit . All forms of human doom</l>
     <l n="20">Arouse but transient thoughts of joy or gloom .</l>
     <l n="21">O law unjust , O grimmest of all maids ,</l>
     <l n="22">Inexorable princess of the shades !</l>
     <l n="23">For , Ursula , thou hadst but tasted time</l>
     <l n="24">And art departed long before thy prime .</l>
     <l n="25">Thou hardly knewest that the sun was bright</l>
     <l n="26">Ere thou didst vanish to the halls of night .</l>
     <l n="27">I would thou hadst not lived that little breath —</l>
     <l n="28">What didst thou know , but only birth , then death ?</l>
     <l n="29">And all the joy a loving child should bring</l>
     <l n="30">Her parents , is become their bitterest sting .</l>
   </lg>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>LAMENT III</head>
     <l n="1">So , thou hast scorned me , my delight and heir ;</l>
     <l n="2">Thy father 's halls , then , were not broad and fair</l>
     <l n="3">Enough for thee to dwell here longer , sweet .</l>
     <l n="4">True , there was nothing , nothing in them meet</l>
     <l n="5">For thy swift-budding reason , that foretold</l>
     <l n="6">Virtues the future years would yet unfold .</l>
     <l n="7">Thy words , thy archness , every turn and bow —</l>
     <l n="8">How sick at heart without them am I now !</l>
     <l n="9">Nay , little comfort , never more shall I</l>
     <l n="10">Behold thee and thy darling drollery .</l>
     <l n="11">What may I do but only follow on</l>
     <l n="12">Along the path where earlier thou hast gone .</l>
     <l n="13">And at its end do thou , with all thy charms ,</l>
     <l n="14">Cast round thy father 's neck thy tender arms .</l>
   </lg>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>LAMENT IV</head>
     <l n="1">Thou hast constrained mine eyes , unholy Death ,</l>
     <l n="2">To watch my dear child breathe her dying breath :</l>
     <l n="3">To watch thee shake the fruit unripe and clinging</l>
     <l n="4">While fear and grief her parents ’ hearts were wringing .</l>
     <l n="5">Ah , never , never could my well-loved child</l>
     <l n="6">Have died and left her father reconciled :</l>
     <l n="7">Never but with a heart like heavy lead</l>
     <l n="8">Could I have watched her go , abandoned .</l>
     <l n="9">And yet at no time could her death have brought</l>
     <l n="10">More cruel ache than now , nor bitterer thought ;</l>
     <l n="11">For had God granted to her ample days</l>
     <l n="12">I might have walked with her down flowered ways</l>
     <l n="13">And left this life at last , content , descending</l>
     <l n="14">To realms of dark Persephone , the all-ending ,</l>
     <l n="15">Without such grievous sorrow in my heart ,</l>
     <l n="16">Of which earth holdeth not the counterpart .</l>
     <l n="17">I marvel not that Niobe , alone</l>
     <l n="18">Amid her dear , dead children , turned to stone .</l>
   </lg>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>LAMENT V</head>
     <l n="1">Just as a little olive offshoot grows</l>
     <l n="2">Beneath its orchard elders ’ shady rows ,</l>
     <l n="3">No budding leaf as yet , no branching limb ,</l>
     <l n="4">Only a rod uprising , virgin-slim —</l>
     <l n="5">Then if the busy gardener , weeding out</l>
     <l n="6">Sharp thorns and nettles , cuts the little sprout ,</l>
     <l n="7">It fades and , losing all its living hue ,</l>
     <l n="8">Drops by the mother from whose roots it grew :</l>
     <l n="9">So was it with my Ursula , my dear ;</l>
     <l n="10">A little space she grew beside us here ,</l>
     <l n="11">Then Death came , breathing pestilence , and she</l>
     <l n="12">Fell , stricken lifeless , by her parent tree .</l>
     <l n="13">Persephone , Persephone , this flow</l>
     <l n="14">Of barren tears ! How couldst thou will it so ?</l>
   </lg>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>LAMENT VI</head>
     <l n="1">Dear little Slavic Sappho , we had thought ,</l>
     <l n="2">Hearing thy songs so sweetly , deftly wrought ,</l>
     <l n="3">That thou shouldst have an heritage one day</l>
     <l n="4">Beyond thy father 's lands : his lute to play .</l>
     <l n="5">For not an hour of daylight 's joyous round</l>
     <l n="6">But thou didst fill it full of lovely sound ,</l>
     <l n="7">Just as the nightingale doth scatter pleasure</l>
     <l n="8">Upon the dark , in glad unstinted measure .</l>
     <l n="9">Then Death came stalking near thee , timid thing ,</l>
     <l n="10">And thou in sudden terror tookest wing .</l>
     <l n="11">Ah , that delight , it was not overlong</l>
     <l n="12">And I pay dear with sorrow for brief song .</l>
     <l n="13">Thou still wert singing when thou cam'st to die ;</l>
     <l n="14">Kissing thy mother , thus thou saidst good-bye :</l>
     <l n="15">“ My mother , I shall serve thee now no more</l>
     <l n="16">Nor sit about thy table 's charming store ;</l>
     <l n="17">I must lay down my keys to go from here ,</l>
     <l n="18">To leave the mansion of my parents dear . ”</l>
     <l n="19">This and what sorrow now will let me tell</l>
     <l n="20">No longer , were my darling 's last farewell .</l>
     <l n="21">Ah , strong her mother 's heart , to feel the pain</l>
     <l n="22">Of those last words and not to burst in twain .</l>

   <lg type="poem">
    <head>LAMENT VII</head>
     <l n="1">Sad trinkets of my little daughter , dresses</l>
     <l n="2">That touched her like caresses ,</l>
     <l n="3">Why do you draw my mournful eyes ? To borrow</l>
     <l n="4">A newer weight of sorrow ?</l>
     <l n="5">No longer will you clothe her form , to fold her</l>
     <l n="6">Around , and wrap her , hold her .</l>
     <l n="7">A hard , unwaking sleep has overpowered</l>
     <l n="8">Her limbs , and now the flowered</l>
     <l n="9">Cool muslin and the ribbon snoods are bootless ,</l>
     <l n="10">The gilded girdles fruitless .</l>
     <l n="11">My little girl , ‘ twas to a bed far other</l>
     <l n="12">That one day thy poor mother</l>
     <l n="13">Had thought to lead thee , and this simple dower</l>
     <l n="14">Suits not the bridal hour ;</l>
     <l n="15">A tiny shroud and gown of her own sewing</l>
     <l n="16">She gives thee at thy going .</l>
     <l n="17">Thy rather brings a clod of earth , a somber</l>
     <l n="18">Pillow for thy last slumber .</l>
     <l n="19">And so a single casket , scant of measure ,</l>
     <l n="20">Locks thee and all thy treasure .</l>

     <l n="1">Thou hast made all the house an empty thing ,</l>
     <l n="2">Dear Ursula , by this thy vanishing .</l>
     <l n="3">Though we are here , ‘ tis yet a vacant place ,</l>
     <l n="4">One little soul had filled so great a space .</l>
     <l n="5">For thou didst sing thy joyousness to all ,</l>
     <l n="6">Running through every nook of house and hall .</l>
     <l n="7">Thou wouldst not have thy mother grieve , nor let</l>
     <l n="8">Thy father with too solemn thinking fret</l>
     <l n="9">His head , but thou must kiss them , daughter mine ,</l>
     <l n="10">And all with that entrancing laugh of thine !</l>
     <l n="11">Now on the house has fallen a dumb blight :</l>
     <l n="12">Thou wilt not come with archness and delight ,</l>

     <l n="5">Into an angel whom no grief can sap ,</l>
     <l n="6">Who is not prone to fear nor evil hap .</l>
     <l n="7">Thou seest all things human as they are —</l>

     <l n="10">Death unafraid , still calm , inviolate .</l>
     <l n="11">Of riches , one thing thou dost hold the measure :</l>
     <l n="12">Proportion to man 's needs — not gold nor treasure ;</l>
     <l n="13">Thy searching eyes have power to behold</l>
     <l n="14">The beggar housed beneath the roof of gold ,</l>
     <l n="15">Nor dost thou grudge the poor man fame as blest</l>
     <l n="16">If he but hearken him to thy behest .</l>

     <l n="2">Long through the night hours sorrow was my guest</l>
     <l n="3">And would not let my fainting body rest ,</l>
     <l n="4">Till just ere dawn from out its slow dominions</l>
     <l n="5">Flew sleep to wrap me in its dear dusk pinions .</l>
     <l n="6">And then it was my mother did appear</l>
     <l n="7">Before mine eyes in vision doubly dear ;</l>
     <l n="8">For in her arms she held my darling one ,</l>
     <l n="9">My Ursula , just as she used to run</l>
     <l n="10">To me at dawn to say her morning prayer ,</l>
     <l n="11">In her white nightgown , with her curling hair</l>
     <l n="12">Framing her rosy face , her eyes about</l>
     <l n="13">To laugh , like flowers only halfway out .</l>
     <l n="14">“ Art thou still sorrowing , my son ? ” Thus spoke</l>
     <l n="15">My mother . Sighing bitterly , I woke ,</l>
     <l n="16">Or seemed to wake , and heard her say once more :</l>
     <l n="17">“ It is thy weeping brings me to this shore :</l>
     <l n="18">Thy lamentations , long uncomforted ,</l>
     <l n="19">Have reached the hidden chambers of the dead ,</l>
     <l n="20">Till I have come to grant thee some small grace</l>

     <l n="35">She used to wear before thy mortal eyes ,</l>
     <l n="36">Though mid the deathless angels , brighter far</l>
     <l n="37">She shineth as the lovely morning star ;</l>

     <l n="41">Were broken off before all that endears</l>
     <l n="42">A life on earth to mortals she might prove —</l>
     <l n="43">Yet think how empty the delights that move</l>

     <l n="50">Then fret not that so early death has come</l>
     <l n="51">To what was dearest thee in Christendom .</l>
     <l n="52">She did not leave a land of much delight ,</l>
     <l n="53">But one of toil and grief and evil blight</l>
     <l n="54">So plenteous , that all which men can hold</l>
     <l n="55">Of their so transitory blessings , gold ,</l>
     <l n="56">Must lose its value through this base alloy ,</l>

     <l n="64">It were to bear or bury them ? Ah , meet</l>

     <l n="71">And death , tear-nourished , hath no pasturage .</l>
     <l n="72">We live a life of endless joy that brings</l>
     <l n="73">Good thoughts ; we know the causes of all things .</l>
     <l n="74">The sun shines on forever here , its light</l>
     <l n="75">Unconquered by impenetrable night ;</l>
     <l n="76">And the Creator in his majesty</l>
     <l n="77">Invisible to mortals , we may see .</l>
     <l n="78">Then turn thy meditations hither , towards</l>
     <l n="79">This changeless gladness and these rich rewards .</l>
     <l n="80">Thou know'st the world , what love of it can do :</l>
     <l n="81">Found thou thine efforts on a base more true .</l>
     <l n="82">Thy little girl hath chosen well her part ,</l>
     <l n="83">Thou may'st believe , as one about to start</l>
     <l n="84">For the first time upon the stormy sea ,</l>
     <l n="85">Beholding there great flux and jeopardy ,</l>
     <l n="86">Returneth to the shore ; while those that raise</l>
     <l n="87">Their sails , the wind or some blind crag betrays ,</l>
     <l n="88">And this one dies from hunger , that from cold :</l>
     <l n="89">Scarce one escapes the perils manifold .</l>
     <l n="90">So she , who , though her years should have surpassed</l>

     <l n="92">Preferred that ending to anticipate</l>

     <l n="104">Could walk all glad and shining-pure within ,</l>
     <l n="105">Her soul still innocent of earthly sin .</l>
     <l n="106">Doubt not , my son , that all is well with her ,</l>
     <l n="107">And let not sorrow be thy conqueror .</l>
     <l n="108">Reason and self-command are precious still</l>
     <l n="109">And yielding all to blighted hope is ill .</l>
     <l n="110">Be in this matter thine own lord , although</l>
     <l n="111">Thy longed-for happiness thou must forego .</l>
     <l n="112">For man is born exposed to circumstance ,</l>
     <l n="113">To be the target of all evil chance ,</l>
     <l n="114">And if we like it or we like it not</l>
     <l n="115">We still can not escape our destined lot .</l>
     <l n="116">Nor hath misfortune singled thee , my son ;</l>
     <l n="117">It lays its burdens upon every one .</l>
     <l n="118">Thy little child was mortal as thou art ,</l>
     <l n="119">She ran her given course and did depart ;</l>
     <l n="120">And if that course was brief , yet who can say</l>
     <l n="121">That she would have been happier to stay ?</l>
     <l n="122">The ways of God are past our finding out ,</l>
     <l n="123">Yet what He holds as good shall we misdoubt ?</l>
     <l n="124">And when the spirit leaves us , it is vain</l>
     <l n="125">To weep so long ; it will not come again .</l>
     <l n="126">And herein man is hardly just to fate ,</l>
     <l n="127">To bear in mind what is unfortunate</l>
     <l n="128">In life and to forget all that transpires</l>
     <l n="129">In full accordance with his own desires .</l>
     <l n="130">And such is Fortune 's power , dearest son ,</l>
     <l n="131">That we should not lament when she hath done</l>
     <l n="132">A bitter turn , but thank her in that she</l>
     <l n="133">Hath held her hand from greater injury .</l>
     <l n="134">So , yielding to the common order , bar</l>
     <l n="135">Thy heart to more disasters than now are ;</l>
     <l n="136">Gaze at the happiness thou dost retain :</l>
     <l n="137">What is not loss , that must be rated gain .</l>
     <l n="138">“ And finally , what profits the expense</l>
     <l n="139">Of thy long labor and the years gone hence ,</l>
     <l n="140">While thou didst spend thyself upon thy books</l>
     <l n="141">And knewest scarce how lightsome pleasure looks ?</l>
     <l n="142">Now from thy grafting pluck the fruit and save</l>
     <l n="143">Something of value from frail nature 's grave .</l>
     <l n="144">To other men in sorrow thou hast shown</l>
     <l n="145">The comfort left them : hast none for thine own ?</l>
     <l n="146">Now , master , heal thyself : time is the cure</l>
     <l n="147">For all ; but he whose wisdom doth abjure</l>
     <l n="148">The common ways , he should anticipate</l>
     <l n="149">The healing for which other men must wait .</l>
     <l n="150">What is time 's cunning ? That it drives away</l>
     <l n="151">Our former haps with newer ones , more gay ,</l>
     <l n="152">Or like the old . So man by taking thought</l>
     <l n="153">Perceives them ere their accidents are wrought ,</l>
     <l n="154">And by such thinking banishes the past</l>
     <l n="155">And views the future , quiet and steadfast .</l>
     <l n="156">Then bear man 's portion like a man , my son ,</l>
     <l n="157">The Lord of grief and comfort is but one . ”</l>
     <l n="158">Then I awoke , and know not if to deem</l>
     <l n="159">This truth itself , or but a passing dream .</l>
