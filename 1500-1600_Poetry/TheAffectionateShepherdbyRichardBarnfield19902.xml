    <head>PREFACE .</head>
    <p n="1">Two copies only of the poem by Barnfield here reprinted , are known to be preserved ; one in Sion College Library , and another , formerly in Heber 's possession , mentioned in “ Bibliotheca Heberiana , ” iv . 15 . Its merits and great rarity have pointed it out as a work deserving to be more known and appreciated . Barnfield is , perhaps , chiefly remembered by his elegant pieces printed in the “ Passionate Pilgrim , ” attributed by some to Shakespeare ; but Mr. Collier has distinctly proved them to belong to the less eminent poet . The “ Affectionate Shepherd ” was his first production , as he himself confesses in the preface to his “ Cynthia , ” 1595 , and it has received the well-merited commendation of Warton . Besides these poems , he is the author of “ The Complaint of Poetrie for the death of Liberalitie , ” 4to . 1598 , and others published at the same time , reprints of which are in the British Museum ; also “ The Encomium of Lady Pecunia , or the Praise of Money , ” a curious manuscript in the Ashmolean Museum , and likewise printed in the author 's life-time . It should be mentioned that in the original copies of the following tract are a few hexameter verses on the Rape of Helen , which have been omitted as of an inferior kind to the other part of the work , and for still more obvious reasons . The “ Affectionate Shepherd ” itself will be found remarkably free from the coarseness which disfigures so much of the Elizabethan literature ,— an additional inducement , if any were necessary , for rescuing it from the liability to destruction which is of course incident to any book of such excessive rarity . Our thanks are due to the Rev . H. Christmas , Librarian of Sion College , for the courtesy and liberality with which he permitted our transcript to be made from a volume of tracts possessing the greatest charm for the bibliographer ; for besides the present one , it contains the first edition of Shakespeare 's Lucrece , and several other pieces of nearly equal value , in the finest possible condition .</p>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Scarce had the morning starre hid from the light</l>
     <l n="2">Heavens crimson canopie with stars bespangled ,</l>
     <l n="3">But I began to rue th ’ unhappy sight</l>
     <l n="4">Of that faire boy that had my hart intangled ;</l>
     <l n="5">Cursing the time , the place , the sense , the sin ;</l>
     <l n="6">I came , I saw , I viewd , I slipped in .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="7">If it be sinne to love a sweet-fac 'd boy ,</l>
     <l n="8">Whose amber locks trust up in golden tramels</l>
     <l n="9">Dangle adowne his lovely cheekes with joy ,</l>
     <l n="10">When pearle and flowers his faire haire enamels ;</l>
     <l n="11">If it be sinne to love a lovely lad ,</l>
     <l n="12">Oh then sinne I , for whom my soule is sad .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="13">His ivory-white and alablaster skin</l>
     <l n="14">Is staind throughout with rare vermillion red ,</l>
     <l n="15">Whose twinckling starrie lights doe never blin</l>
     <l n="16">To shine on lovely Venus , Beauties bed ;</l>
     <l n="17">But as the lillie and the blushing rose ,</l>
     <l n="18">So white and red on him in order growes .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="19">Upon a time the nymphs bestird them-selves</l>
     <l n="20">To trie who could his beautie soonest win ;</l>
     <l n="21">But he accounted them but all as elves ,</l>
     <l n="22">Except it were the faire Queene Guendolen :</l>
     <l n="23">Her he embrac 'd , of her was beloved ,</l>
     <l n="24">With plaints he proved , and with teares he moved .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="25">But her an old man had beene sutor too ,</l>
     <l n="26">That in his age began to doate againe ;</l>
     <l n="27">Her would he often pray , and often woo ,</l>
     <l n="28">When through old age enfeebled was his braine :</l>
     <l n="29">But she before had lov 'd a lustie youth ,</l>
     <l n="30">That now was dead , the cause of all her ruth .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="31">And thus it hapned , Death and Cupid met</l>
     <l n="32">Upon a time at swilling Bacchus house ,</l>
     <l n="33">Where daintie cates upon the boord were set ,</l>
     <l n="34">And goblets full of wine to drinke carouse :</l>
     <l n="35">Where Love and Death did love the licor so ,</l>
     <l n="36">That out they fall and to the fray they goe .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="37">And having both their quivers at their backe</l>
     <l n="38">Fild full of arrows ; th ’ one of fatall steele ,</l>
     <l n="39">The other all of gold ; Deaths shaft was black ,</l>
     <l n="40">But Loves was yellow : Fortune turnd her wheele ,</l>
     <l n="41">And from Deaths quiver fell a fatall shaft ,</l>
     <l n="42">That under Cupid by the winde was waft .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="43">And at the same time by ill hap there fell</l>
     <l n="44">Another arrow out of Cupids quiver ,</l>
     <l n="45">The which was carried by the winde at will ,</l>
     <l n="46">And under Death the amorous shaft did shiver :</l>
     <l n="47">They being parted , Love tooke up Deaths dart ,</l>
     <l n="48">And Death tooke up Loves arrow for his part .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="49">Thus as they wandred both about the world ,</l>
     <l n="50">At last Death met with one of feeble age :</l>
     <l n="51">Wherewith he drew a shaft and at him hurld</l>
     <l n="52">The unknowne arrow with a furious rage ,</l>
     <l n="53">Thinking to strike him dead with Deaths blacke dart ;</l>
     <l n="54">But he , alas , with Love did wound his hart !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="55">This was the doting foole , this was the man</l>
     <l n="56">That lov 'd faire Guendolena , Queene of Beautie ;</l>
     <l n="57">Shee cannot shake him off , doo what she can ,</l>
     <l n="58">For he hath vowd to her his soules last duety :</l>
     <l n="59">Making him trim upon the holydaies ,</l>
     <l n="60">And crownes his love with garlands made of baies .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="61">Now doth he stroke his beard , and now againe</l>
     <l n="62">He wipes the drivel from his filthy chin ;</l>
     <l n="63">Now offers he a kisse , but high Disdaine</l>
     <l n="64">Will not permit her hart to pity him :</l>
     <l n="65">Her hart more hard than adamant or steele ,</l>
     <l n="66">Her hart more changeable than Fortunes wheele .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="67">But leave we him in love up to the eares ,</l>
     <l n="68">And tell how Love behav 'd himselfe abroad ;</l>
     <l n="69">Who seeing one that mourned still in teares ,</l>
     <l n="70">A young man groaning under Loves great load ,</l>
     <l n="71">Thinking to ease his burden , rid his paines ,</l>
     <l n="72">For men have griefe as long as life remaines .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="73">Alas , the while that unawares he drue</l>
     <l n="74">The fatall shaft that Death had dropt before ,</l>
     <l n="75">By which deceit great harme did then insue ,</l>
     <l n="76">Stayning his face with blood and filthy goare :</l>
     <l n="77">His face , that was to Guendolen more deere</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="79">This was that faire and beautifull young man ,</l>
     <l n="80">Whom Guendolena so lamented for ;</l>
     <l n="81">This is that Love whom she doth curse and ban ,</l>
     <l n="82">Because she doth that dismall chaunce abhor :</l>
     <l n="83">And if it were not for his mothers sake ,</l>
     <l n="84">Even Ganimede himselfe she would forsake .</l>

   <note>SONNET . Loe here behold these tributarie teares Paid to thy faire but cruell tyrant eyes ; Loe here the blossome of my youthfull yeares , Nipt with the fresh of thy wraths winter , dyes ! Here on Loves altar I doo offer up This burning hart for my soules sacrifice ; Here I receave this deadly-poysned cu [ p ] Of Circe charm 'd , wherein deepe magicke lyes . Then teares , if you be happie teares indeed , And hart , if thou be lodged in his brest , And cup , if thou canst helpe despaire with speed , Teares , hart , and cup , conjoine to make me blest ! Teares move , hart win , cup cause , ruth , love , desire , In word , in deed ; by moane , by zeale , by fire .</note>
   <note>FINIS . THE COMPLAINT OF CHASTITIE , BRIEFELY TOUCHING THE CAUSE OF THE DEATH OF MATILDA FITZWALTERS , AN ENGLISH LADIE , SOMETIME LOVED OF KING JOHN , AFTER POYSONED . THE STORIE IS AT LARGE WRITTEN BY MICHAEL DREYTON . You modest dames , inricht with chastitie , Maske your bright eyes with Vestaes sable vaile , Since few are left so faire or chast as shee , Matter for me to weepe , you to bewaile ! For manie seeming so , of Vertue faile , Whose lovely cheeks , with rare vermilion tainted , Can never blush , because their faire is painted . O faire-foule tincture , staine of woman kinde , Mother of Mischiefe , daughter of Deceate , False traitor to the soule , blot to the minde , Usurping tyrant of true beauties seate ! Right cousner of the eye , lewd follies baite , The flag of filthines , the sinke of shame , The divells dye , dishonour of thy name ! Monster of art , bastard of bad desier , Il-worshipt idoll , false imagerie ! Ensigne of vice , to thine owne selfe a lier , Silent inchaunter , mindes anatomie , Sly bawd to lust , pandor to infamie , Slaunder of Truth , truth of dissimulation , Staining our clymate more than anie nation ! What shall I say to thee , thou scorne of Nature , Blacke spot of sinne , vylde lure of lecherie , Injurious blame to everie fæmale creature , Wronger of time , broker of trecherie , Trap of greene youth , false womens witcherie , Handmaid of pride , highway to wickednesse , Yet pathway to repentance nere the lesse ? Thou dost entice the minde to dooing evill , Thou setst dissention twixt the man and wife ; A saint in show , and yet indeed a devill , Thou art the cause of everie common strife ; Thou art the life of Death , the death of Life ! Thou doost betray thyselfe to infamie , When thou art once discerned by the eye . Ah , little knew Matilda of thy being , Those times were pure from all impure complection ; Then Love came of Desert , Desert of seeing , Then Vertue was the mother of Affection , But Beautie now is under no subjection ; Then women were the same that men did deeme , But now they are the same they doo not seeme . What fæmale now intreated of a king With gold and jewels , pearles and precious stones , Would willingly refuse so sweete a thing , Onely for a little show of Vertue ones ? Women have kindnes grafted in their bones . Gold is a deepe-perswading orator , Especially where few the fault abhor . But yet shee rather deadly poyson chose , Oh cruell bane of most accursed clime ! Than staine that milk-white mayden virgin rose , Which shee had kept unspotted till that time , And not corrupted with this earthly slime . Her soule shall live , inclosd eternally In that pure shrine of immortality ! This is my doome , and this shall come to passe , For what are pleasures but still vading joyes ? Fading as flowers , brittle as a glasse , Or potters clay , crost with the least annoyes ? All things in this life are but trifling toyes , But Fame and Vertue never shall decay , For Fame is toomblesse , Vertue lives for aye ! FINIS .</note>
