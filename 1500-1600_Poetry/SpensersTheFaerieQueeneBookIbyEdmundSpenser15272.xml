    <head>INTRODUCTION</head>
    <p n="1">I . THE AGE WHICH PRODUCED THE FAERIE QUEENE</p>
    <p n="2">The study of the Faerie Queene should be preceded by a review of the great age in which it was written . An intimate relation exists between the history of the English nation and the works of English authors . This close connection between purely external events and literary masterpieces is especially marked in a study of the Elizabethan Age . To understand the marvelous outburst of song , the incomparable drama , and the stately prose of this period , one must enter deeply into the political , social , and religious life of the times .</p>
    <p n="3">The Faerie Queene was the product of certain definite conditions which existed in England toward the close of the sixteenth century . The first of these national conditions was the movement known as the revival of chivalry ; the second was the spirit of nationality fostered by the English Reformation ; and the third was that phase of the English Renaissance commonly called the revival of learning .</p>
    <p n="4">The closing decade of Queen Elizabeth 's reign was marked by a strong reaction toward romanticism . The feudal system with its many imperfections had become a memory , and had been idealized by the people . The nation felt pride in its new aristocracy , sprung largely from the middle class , and based rather on worth than ancestry . The bitterness of the Wars of the Roses was forgotten , and was succeeded by an era of reconciliation and good feeling . England was united in a heroic queen whom all sects , ranks , and parties idolized . The whole country exulting in its new sense of freedom and power became a fairyland of youth , springtime , and romantic achievement .</p>
    <p n="5">Wise and gallant courtiers , like Sidney , Leicester , and Raleigh , gathered about the queen , and formed a new chivalry devoted to deeds of adventure and exploits of mind in her honor . The spirit of the old sea-kings lived again in Drake and his bold buccaneers , who swept the proud Spaniards from the seas . With the defeat of the Invincible Armada , the greatest naval expedition of modern times , the fear of Spanish and Catholic domination rolled away . The whole land was saturated with an unexpressed poetry , and the imagination of young and old was so fired with patriotism and noble endeavor that nothing seemed impossible . Add to this intense delight in life , with all its mystery , beauty , and power , the keen zest for learning which filled the air that men breathed , and it is easy to understand that the time was ripe for a new and brilliant epoch in literature . First among the poetic geniuses of the Elizabethan period came Edmund Spenser with his Faerie Queene , the allegory of an ideal chivalry .</p>
    <p n="6">This poem is one of the fruits of that intellectual awakening which first fertilized Italian thought in the twelfth century , and , slowly spreading over Europe , made its way into England in the fifteenth century . The mighty impulse of this New Learning culminated during the reign of the Virgin Queen in a profound quickening of the national consciousness , and in arousing an intense curiosity to know and to imitate the rich treasures of the classics and romance . Its first phase was the classical revival . The tyrannous authority of ecclesiasticism had long since been broken ; a general reaction from Christian asceticism had set in ; and by the side of the ceremonies of the church had been introduced a semi-pagan religion of art — the worship of moral and sensuous beauty . Illiteracy was no longer the style at court . Elizabeth herself set the example in the study of Greek . Books and manuscripts were eagerly sought after , Scholars became conversant with Homer , Plato , Aristotle , and the great tragic poets Sophocles , Euripides , and Æschylus ; and translations for the many of Vergil , Ovid , Plautus , Terence , and Seneca poured forth from the printing-presses of London . The English mind was strongly tempered by the idealistic philosophy of Plato and Aristotle , and the influence of Latin tragedy and comedy was strongly felt by the early English drama .</p>
    <p n="7">Along with this classical culture came a higher appreciation of the beauty of mediævalism . The romantic tendency of the age fostered the study of the great epics of chivalry , Ariosto 's Orlando Furioso and Tasso 's Jerusalem Delivered , and of the cycles of French romance . From the Italian poets especially Spenser borrowed freely . Ariosto 's fresh naturalness and magic machinery influenced him most strongly , but he was indebted to the semi-classical Tasso for whole scenes . On the whole , therefore , Spenser 's literary affinities were more with the Gothic than the classical .</p>
    <p n="8">Spenser was also the spokesman of his time on religious questions . The violent controversies of the Reformation period were over . Having turned from the beliefs of ages with passionate rejection , the English people had achieved religious freedom , and were strongly rooted in Protestantism , which took on a distinctly national aspect . That Calvinism was at that time the popular and aristocratic form of Protestantism is evident from references in the Faerie Queene .</p>
    <p n="9">Spenser lived in the afterglow of the great age of chivalry . The passing glories of knighthood in its flower impressed his imagination like a gorgeous dream , and he was thus inspired to catch and crystallize into permanent art its romantic spirit and heroic deeds . Into the framework of his romance of chivalry he inserted a veiled picture of the struggles and sufferings of his own people in Ireland . The Faerie Queene might almost be called the epic of the English conquest of Ireland . The poet himself and many of his friends were in that unhappy island as representatives of the queen 's government , trying to pacify the natives , and establish law and order out of discontent and anarchy . Spenser 's poem was written for the most part amidst all these scenes of misery and disorder , and the courage , justice , and energy shown by his countrymen were aptly portrayed under the allegory of a mighty spiritual warfare of the knights of old against the power of evil .</p>
    <p n="10">Spenser 's essay on A View of the Present State of Ireland shows that , far from shutting himself up in a fool 's paradise of fancy , he was fully awake to the social and political condition of that turbulent island , and that it furnished him with concrete examples of those vices and virtues , bold encounters and hair-breadth escapes , strange wanderings and deeds of violence , with which he has crowded the allegory of the Faerie Queene .</p>

    <p>II . THE AUTHOR OF THE FAERIE QUEENE Edmund Spenser was born in London near the Tower in the year 1552 . His parents were poor , though they were probably connected with the Lancashire branch of the old family of Le Despensers , “ an house of ancient fame , ” from which the Northampton Spencers were also descended . The poet 's familiarity with the rural life and dialect of the north country supports the theory that as a boy he spent some time in Lancashire . Beyond two or three facts , nothing is known with certainty of his early years . He himself tells us that his mother 's name was Elizabeth , and that London was his “ most kindly nurse . ” His name is mentioned as one of six poor pupils of the Merchant Taylors ’ School , who received assistance from a generous country squire . At the age of seventeen , Master Edmund became a student in Pembroke Hall , one of the colleges of the great University of Cambridge . His position was that of a sizar , or paid scholar , who was exempt from the payment of tuition fees and earned his way by serving in the dining hall or performing other menial duties . His poverty , however , did not prevent him from forming many helpful friendships with his fellow-students . Among his most valued friends he numbered Launcelot Andrews , afterward Bishop of Winchester , Edward Kirke , a young man of Spenser 's own age , who soon after edited his friend 's first important poem , the Shepheards Calender , with elaborate notes , and most important of all , the famous classical scholar , a fellow of Pembroke , Gabriel Harvey , who was a few years older than Spenser , and was later immortalized as the Hobbinoll of the Faerie Queene . It was by Harvey that the poet was introduced to Sir Philip Sidney , the most accomplished gentleman in England , and a favorite of Queen Elizabeth . Spenser 's residence in Cambridge extended over seven years , during which he received the usual degrees of bachelor and master of arts . He became one of the most learned of English poets , and we may infer that while at this seat of learning he laid the foundations for his wide scholarship in the diligent study of the Greek and Latin classics , the philosophy of Plato and Aristotle , the pastoral poetry of Theocritus and Vergil , and the great mediæval epics of Italian literature . On account of some misunderstanding with the master and tutors of his college , Spenser failed to receive the appointment to a fellowship , and left the University in 1576 , at the age of twenty-four . His failure to attain the highest scholastic recognition was due , it is supposed , to his being involved in some of the dangerous controversies which were ripe in Cambridge at that time “ with daily spawning of new opinions and heresies in divinity , in philosophy , in humanity , and in manners . ” On leaving the University , Spenser resided for about a year with relatives in Lancashire , where he found employment . During this time he had an unrequited love affair with an unknown beauty whom he celebrated in the Shepheards Calender under the name of Rosalind , “ the widow 's daughter of the glen . ” A rival , Menalchas , was more successful in finding favor with his fair neighbor . Although he had before this turned his attention to poetry by translating the sonnets of Petrarch and Du Bellay ( published in 1569 ) , it was while here in the North country that he first showed his high poetic gifts in original composition . After a visit to Sir Philip Sidney at Penshurst , Spenser went down to London with his friend in 1578 , and was presented to Sidney 's great uncle , the Earl of Leicester . He thus at once had an opportunity for advancement through the influence of powerful patrons , a necessity with poor young authors in that age . An immediate result of his acquaintance with Sidney , with whom he was now on relations of intimate friendship , was an introduction into the best society of the metropolis . This period of association with many of the most distinguished and cultivated men in England , together with the succession of brilliant pageants , masks , and processions , which he witnessed at court and at Lord Leicester 's mansion , must have done much to refine his tastes and broaden his outlook on the world .</p>

  <body>
   <p>In personal appearance Spenser was a fine type of a sixteenth century gentleman . The grace and dignity of his bearing was enhanced by a face of tender and thoughtful expression in which warmth of feeling was subdued by the informing spirit of refinement , truthfulness , simplicity , and nobility . He possessed a fine dome-like forehead , curling hair , brown eyes , full sensuous lips , and a nose that was straight and strongly moulded . His long spare face was adorned with a full mustache and a closely cropped Van Dyke beard .</p>
   <p>The Shepheards Calender was published in the winter of 1579 with a grateful and complimentary dedication to Sidney . It is an academic exercise consisting of a series of twelve pastoral poems in imitation of the eclogues of Vergil and Theocritus . The poem is cast in the form of dialogues between shepherds , who converse on such subjects as love , religion , and old age . In three eclogues the poet attacks with Puritan zeal the pomp and sloth of the worldly clergy , and one is devoted to the courtly praise of the queen . It was at once recognized as the most notable poem that had appeared since the death of Chaucer , and placed Spenser immediately at the head of living English poets .</p>
   <p>In 1580 Spenser went over to Ireland as private secretary to Lord Grey of Wilton , the Artegall of the Legend of Justice in the Faerie Queene . After the recall of his patron he remained in that turbulent island in various civil positions for the rest of his life , with the exception of two or three visits and a last sad flight to England . For seven years he was clerk of the Court of Chancery in Dublin , and then was appointed clerk to the Council of Munster . In 1586 he was granted the forfeited estate of the Earl of Desmond in Cork County , and two years later took up his residence in Kilcolman Castle , which was beautifully situated on a lake with a distant view of mountains . In the disturbed political condition of the country , life here seemed a sort of exile to the poet , but its very loneliness and danger gave the stimulus needed for the development of his peculiar genius .</p>
   <p>“ Here , ” says Mr. Stopford Brooke , “ at the foot of the Galtees , and bordered to the north by the wild country , the scenery of which is frequently painted in the Faerie Queene and in whose woods and savage places such adventures constantly took place in the service of Elizabeth as are recorded in the Faerie Queene , the first three books of that great poem were finished . ” Spenser had spent the first three years of his residence at Kilcolman at work on this masterpiece , which had been begun in England , under the encouragement of Sidney , probably before 1580 . The knightly Sidney died heroically at the battle of Zutphen , in 1586 , and Spenser voiced the lament of all England in the beautiful pastoral elegy Astrophel which he composed in memory of “ the most noble and valorous knight . ”</p>
   <p>Soon after coming to Ireland , Spenser made the acquaintance of Sir Walter Raleigh , which erelong ripened into intimate friendship . A memorable visit from Raleigh , who was now a neighbor of the poet 's , having also received a part of the forfeited Desmond estate , led to the publication of the Faerie Queene . Sitting under the shade “ of the green alders of the Mulla 's shore , ” Spenser read to his guest the first books of his poem . So pleased was Raleigh that he persuaded the poet to accompany him to London , and there lay his poem at the feet of the great queen , whose praises he had so gloriously sung . The trip was made , Spenser was presented to Elizabeth , and read to her Majesty the three Legends of Holiness , Temperance , and Chastity . She was delighted with the fragmentary epic in which she heard herself delicately complimented in turn as Gloriana , Belphoebe , and Britomart , conferred upon the poet a pension of £ 50 yearly , and permitted the Faerie Queene to be published with a dedication to herself . Launched under such auspices , it is no wonder that the poem was received by the court and all England with unprecedented applause .</p>
   <p>The next year while still in London , Spenser collected his early poems and issued them under the title of Complaints . In this volume were the Ruins of Time and the Tears of the Muses , two poems on the indifference shown to literature before 1580 , and the remarkable Mother Hubberds Tale , a bitter satire on the army , the court , the church , and politics . His Daphnaida was also published about the same time . On his return to Ireland he gave a charming picture of life at Kilcolman Castle , with an account of his visit to the court , in Colin Clout 's Come Home Again . The story of the long and desperate courtship of his second love , Elizabeth , whom he wedded in 1594 , is told in the Amoretti , a sonnet sequence full of passion and tenderness . His rapturous wedding ode , the Epithalamion , which is , by general consent , the most glorious bridal song in our language , and the most perfect of all his poems in its freshness , purity , and passion , was also published in 1595 . The next year Spenser was back in London and published the Prothalamion , a lovely ode on the marriage of Lord Worcester 's daughters , and his four Hymns on Love and Beauty , Heavenly Love , and Heavenly Beauty . The first two Hymns are early poems , and the two latter maturer work embodying Petrarch 's philosophy , which teaches that earthly love is a ladder that leads men to the love of God . In this year , 1596 , also appeared the last three books of the Faerie Queene , containing the Legends of Friendship , Justice , and Courtesy .</p>
   <p>At the height of his fame , happiness , and prosperity , Spenser returned for the last time to Ireland in 1597 , and was recommended by the queen for the office of Sheriff of Cork . Surrounded by his beloved wife and children , his domestic life was serene and happy , but in gloomy contrast his public life was stormy and full of anxiety and danger . He was the acknowledged prince of living poets , and was planning the completion of his mighty epic of the private virtues in twelve books , to be followed by twelve more on the civic virtues . The native Irish had steadily withstood his claim to the estate , and continually harassed him with lawsuits . They detested their foreign oppressors and awaited a favorable opportunity to rise . Discord and riot increased on all sides . The ever growing murmurs of discontent gave place to cries for vengeance and unrepressed acts of hostility . Finally , in the fall of 1598 , there occurred a fearful uprising known as Tyrone 's Rebellion , in which the outraged peasants fiercely attacked the castle , plundering and burning . Spenser and his family barely escaped with their lives . According to one old tradition , an infant child was left behind in the hurried flight and perished in the flames ; but this has been shown to be but one of the wild rumors repeated to exaggerate the horror of the uprising . Long after Spenser 's death , it was also rumored that the last six books of the Faerie Queene had been lost in the flight ; but the story is now utterly discredited .</p>
   <p>Spenser once more arrived in London , but he was now in dire distress and prostrated by the hardships which he had suffered . There on January 16 , 1599 , at a tavern in King Street , Westminster , the great poet died broken-hearted and in poverty . Drummond of Hawthornden states that Ben Jonson told him that Spenser “ died for lack of bread in King Street , and refused 20 pieces sent to him by my Lord of Essex , and said He was sorrie he had no time to spend them . ” The story is probably a bit of exaggerated gossip . He was buried close to the tomb of Chaucer in the Poets ’ Corner in Westminster Abbey , his fellow-poets bearing the pall , and the Earl of Essex defraying the expenses of the funeral . Referring to the death of Spenser 's great contemporary , Basse wrote :—</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ Renownèd Spenser , lie a thought more nigh</l>
     <l n="2">To learnèd Chaucer , and rare Beaumont , lie</l>
     <l n="3">A little nearer Spenser , to make room</l>
     <l n="4">For Shakespeare in your threefold , fourfold tomb . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">“ Thus , ” says Mr. Stopford Brooke , appropriately , “ London , ‘ his most kindly</l>
     <l n="6">nurse , ’ takes care also of his dust , and England keeps him in her love . ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Spenser 's influence on English poetry can hardly be overestimated . Keats called him “ the poets ’ poet , ” a title which has been universally approved . “ He is the poet of all others , ” says Mr. Saintsbury , “ for those who seek in poetry only poetical qualities . ” His work has appealed most strongly to those who have been poets themselves , for with him the poetical attraction is supreme . Many of the greatest poets have delighted to call him master , and have shown him the same loving reverence which he gave to Chaucer . Minor poets like Sidney , Drayton , and Daniel paid tribute to his inspiration ; Milton was deeply indebted to him , especially in Lycidas ; and many of the pensive poets of the seventeenth century show traces of his influence . “ Spenser delighted Shakespeare , ” says Mr. Church ; “ he was the poetical master of Cowley , and then of Milton , and in a sense of Dryden , and even Pope . ” Giles and Phineas Fletcher , William Browne , Sir William Alexander , Shenstone , Collins , Cowley , Gray , and James Thomson were all direct followers of Spenser . His influence upon the poets of the romantic revival of the nineteenth century is even more marked . “ Spenser begot Keats , ” says Mr. Saintsbury , “ and Keats begot Tennyson , and Tennyson begot all the rest . ” Among this notable company of disciples should be mentioned especially Rossetti , Morris , and Swinburne . If we include within the sphere of Spenser 's influence also those who have made use of the stanza which he invented , we must add the names of Burns , Shelley , Byron , Beattie , Campbell , Scott , and Wordsworth . When we consider the large number of poets in whom Spenser awakened the poetic gift , or those to whose powers he gave direction , we may safely pronounce him the most seminal poet in the language .</p>
   <p>III . STUDY OF THE FAERIE QUEENE</p>
   <p>1 . A ROMANTIC EPIC .— The Faerie Queene is the most perfect type which we have in English of the purely romantic poem . Four elements enter into its composition : “ it is pastoral by association , chivalrous by temper , ethical by tendency , and allegorical by treatment ” ( Renton ) . Its subject was taken from the old cycle of Arthurian legends , which were brightened with the terrorless magic of Ariosto and Tasso . The scene of the adventures is laid in the enchanted forests and castles of the far away and unreal fairyland of mediæval chivalry , and the incidents themselves are either highly improbable or frankly impossible . The language is frequently archaic and designedly unfamiliar . Much of the machinery and properties used in carrying on the story , such as speaking myrtles , magic mirrors , swords , rings , impenetrable armor , and healing fountains , is supernatural . All the characters — the knights , ladies , dwarfs , magicians , dragons , nymphs , satyrs , and giants — are the conventional figures of pastoral romance .</p>
   <p>The framework of the plot of the Faerie Queene is vast and loosely put together . There are six main stories , or legends , and each contains several digressions and involved episodes . The plan of the entire work , which the author only half completed , is outlined in his letter to Sir Walter Raleigh . This letter serves as an admirable introduction to the poem , and should be read attentively by the student . Gloriana , the Queen of Fairyland , holds at her court a solemn feudal festival , lasting twelve days , during which she sends forth twelve of her greatest knights on as many separate adventures . The knights are commissioned to champion the cause of persons in distress and redress their wrongs . The ideal knight , Prince Arthur , is the central male figure of the poem . He is enamoured of Gloriana , having seen her in a wondrous vision , and is represented as journeying in quest of her . He appears in all of the legends at opportune moments to succor the knights when they are hard beset or in the power of their enemies . The six extant books contain respectively the legends of ( I ) the Knight of the Redcrosse , or Holiness , ( II ) Sir Guyon , the Knight of Temperance , ( III ) Britomart , the female Knight of Chastity , ( IV ) Sir Campbell and Sir Triamond , the Knights of Friendship , ( V ) Sir Artegall , the Knight of Justice , and ( VI ) Sir Caledore , the Knight of Courtesy . Book I is an allegory of man 's relation to God , Book II , of man 's relation to himself , Books III , IV , V , and VI , of man 's relation to his fellow-man . Prince Arthur , the personification of Magnificence , by which Spenser means Magnanimity ( Aristotle 's [ Greek : megalopsychía ]) , is the ideal of a perfect character , in which all the private virtues are united . It is a poem of culture , inculcating the moral ideals of Aristotle and the teachings of Christianity .</p>
   <p>2 . INFLUENCE OF THE NEW LEARNING .— Like Milton , Gray , and other English poets , Spenser was a scholar familiar with the best in ancient and modern literature . As to Spenser 's specific indebtedness , though he owed much in incident and diction to Chaucer 's version of the Romance of the Rose and to Malory 's Morte d'Arthur , the great epic poets , Tasso and Ariosto , should be given first place . The resemblance of passages in the Faerie Queene to others in the Orlando Furioso and the Jerusalem Delivered is so striking that some have accused the English poet of paraphrasing and slavishly borrowing from the two Italians . Many of these parallels are pointed out in the notes . To this criticism , Mr. Saintsbury remarks : “ Not , perhaps , till the Orlando has been carefully read , and read in the original , is Spenser 's real greatness understood . He has often , and evidently of purpose , challenged comparison ; but in every instance it will be found that his beauties are emphatically his own . He has followed Ariosto only as Vergil has followed Homer , and much less slavishly . ”</p>
   <p>The influence of the New Learning is clearly evident in Spenser 's use of classical mythology . Greek myths are placed side by side with Christian imagery and legends . Like Dante , the poet did not consider the Hellenic doctrine of sensuous beauty to be antagonistic to the truths of religion . There is sometimes an incongruous confusion of classicism and mediævalism , as when a magician is seen in the house of Morpheus , and a sorcerer goes to the realm of Pluto . Spenser was guided by a higher and truer sense of beauty than the classical purists know .</p>
   <p>A very attractive element of his classicism is his worship of beauty . The Greek conception of beauty included two forms — the sensuous and the spiritual . So richly colored and voluptuous are his descriptions that he has been called the painters ’ poet , “ the Rubens , ” and “ the Raphael of the poets . ” As with Plato , Spenser 's idea of the spiritually beautiful includes the true and the good . Sensuous beauty is seen in the forms of external nature , like the morning mist and sunshine , the rose gardens , the green elders , and the quiet streams . His ideal of perfect sensuous and spiritual beauty combined is found in womanhood . Such a one is Una , the dream of the poet 's young manhood , and we recognize in her one whose soul is as fair as her face — an idealized type of a woman in real life who calls forth all our love and reverence .</p>
   <p>3 . INTERPRETATION OF THE ALLEGORY .— In the sixteenth century it was the opinion of Puritan England that every literary masterpiece should not only give entertainment , but should also teach some moral or spiritual lesson . “ No one , ” says Mr. Patee , “ after reading Spenser 's letter to Raleigh , can wander far into Spenser 's poem without the conviction that the author 's central purpose was didactic , almost as much as was Bunyan 's in Pilgrim 's Progress . ” Milton doubtless had this feature of the Faerie Queene in mind when he wrote in Il Penseroso :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ And if aught else great bards beside</l>
     <l n="2">In sage and solemn tunes have sung</l>
     <l n="3">Of turneys , and of trophies hung ,</l>
     <l n="4">Of forests and enchantments drear ,</l>
     <l n="5">Where more is meant than meets the ear . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>That the allegory of the poem is closely connected with its aim and ethical tendency is evident from the statement of the author that “ the generall end therefore of all the booke is to fashion a gentleman or noble person in vertuous and gentle discipline . Which for that I conceived should be most plausible and pleasing , being coloured with an historical fiction , the which the most part of men delight to read , rather for varietie of matter then for profite of the ensample . ” The Faerie Queene is , therefore , according to the avowed purpose of its author , a poem of culture . Though it is one of the most highly artistic works in the language , it is at the same time one of the most didactic . “ It professes , ” says Mr. Church , “ to be a veiled exposition of moral philosophy . ”</p>
   <p>The allegory is threefold ,— moral , religious , and personal .</p>
   <p>( a ) Moral Allegory .— The characters all represent various virtues and vices , whose intrigues and warfare against each other symbolize the struggle of the human soul after perfection . The Redcross Knight , for example , personifies the single private virtue of holiness , while Prince Arthur stands for that perfect manhood which combines all the moral qualities ; Una represents abstract truth , while Gloriana symbolizes the union of all the virtues in perfect womanhood .</p>
   <p>( b ) Religious or Spiritual Allegory .— Under this interpretation the Redcross Knight is a personification of Protestant England , or the church militant , while Una represents the true religion of the Reformed Church . On the other hand , Archimago symbolizes the deceptions of the Jesuits and Duessa the false Church of Rome masquerading as true religion .</p>
   <p>( c ) Personal and Political Allegory .— Here we find a concrete presentation of many of Spenser 's chief contemporaries . One of Spenser 's prime objects in composing his epic was to please certain powerful persons at court , and above all to win praise and patronage from the vain and flattery loving queen , whom he celebrates as Gloriana . Prince Arthur is a character that similarly pays homage to Lord Leicester . In the Redcross Knight he compliments , no doubt , some gentleman like Sir Philip Sidney or Sir Walter Raleigh , as if he were a second St. George , the patron saint of England , while in Una we may see idealized some fair lady of the court . In Archimago he satirizes the odious King Philip II of Spain , and in false Duessa the fascinating intriguer , Mary Queen of Scots , who was undeserving so hard a blow .</p>

     <l n="33">4 . THE SPENSERIAN STANZA .— The Faerie Queene is written in the Spenserian</l>
     <l n="34">Stanza , a form which the poet himself invented as a suitable vehicle for a</l>
     <l n="35">long narrative poem . Suggestions for its construction were taken from three</l>
     <l n="36">Italian metres — the Ottava Rima , the Terza Rima , the Sonnet — and the</l>
     <l n="37">Ballade stanza . There are eight lines in the iambic pentameter measure</l>
     <l n="38">( five accents ) ; e. g .—</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>v -  / -  | v -  / -  | v -  / -  | v -  / -  | v -  / -  a gen | tle knight | was prick | ing on | the plaine followed by one iambic hexameter , or Alexandrine ( six accents ) ; e. g .—</p>
   <p>v -  / -  | v -  / -  | v -  / -  | v -  / -  | v -  / -  | v -  / -  as one | for knight | ly giusts | and fierce | encount | ers fitt The rhymes are arranged in the following order : ab ab bc bcc . It will be observed that the two quatrains are bound together by the first two b rhymes , and the Alexandrine , which rhymes with the eighth line , draws out the harmony with a peculiar lingering effect . In scanning and reading it is necessary to observe the laws of accentuation and pronunciation prevailing in Spenser 's day ; e. g . in learned ( I , i ) , undeserved ( I , ii ) , and woundes ( V , xvii ) the final syllable is sounded , patience ( X , xxix ) is trisyllabic , devotion ( X , xl ) is four syllables , and entertainment ( X , xxxvii ) is accented on the second and fourth syllables . Frequently there is in the line a cæsural pause , which may occur anywhere ; e. g .—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ And quite dismembred hath ; | the thirsty land</l>
     <l n="2">Dronke up his life ; | his corse left on the strand . ” ( III , xx . )</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The rhythm of the meter is also varied by the alternating of end-stopped and run-on lines , as in the last quotation . An end-stopped line has a pause at the end , usually indicated by some mark of punctuation . A run-on line should be read closely with the following line with only a slight pause to indicate the line-unit . Monotony is prevented by the occasional use of a light or feminine ending — a syllable on which the voice does not or cannot rest ; e. g .—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Then choosing out few words most horrible . ” ( I , xxxvii . )</l>
     <l n="2">“ That for his love refused deity . ” ( III , xxi . )</l>
     <l n="3">“ His ship far come from watrie wilderness . ” ( III , xxxii . )</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The use of alliteration , i. e . having several words in a line beginning with the same letter , is another device frequently employed by Spenser for musical effect ; e. g .—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ In which that wicked wight his dayes doth weare . ” ( I , xxxvi . )</l>
     <l n="2">“ Sweet slombring deaw , the which to sleep them biddes . ” ( I , xxxvi . )</l>
   </lg>
   <p>5 . VERSIFICATION .— In the handling of his stanza , Spenser revealed a harmony , sweetness , and color never before dreamed of in the English . Its compass , which admitted of an almost endless variety of cadence , harmonized well with the necessity for continuous narration . It appeals to the eye as well as to the ear , with its now languid , now vigorous , but always graceful turn of phrase . Its movement has been compared to the smooth , steady , irresistible sweep of water in a mighty river . Like Lyly , Marlowe , and Shakespeare , Spenser felt the new delight in the pictorial and musical qualities of words , and invented new melodies and word pictures . He aimed rather at finish , exactness , and fastidious neatness than at ease , freedom , and irregularity ; and if his versification has any fault , it is that of monotony . The atmosphere is always perfectly adapted to the theme .</p>
   <p>6 . DICTION AND STYLE .— The peculiar diction of the Faerie Queene should receive the careful attention of the student . As a romantic poet , Spenser often preferred archaic and semi-obsolete language to more modern forms . He uses four classes of words that were recognized as the proper and conventional language of pastoral and romantic poetry ; viz . ( a ) archaisms , ( b ) dialect , ( c ) classicisms , and ( d ) gallicisms . He did not hesitate to adopt from Chaucer many obsolete words and grammatical forms . Examples are : the double negative with ne ; eyen , lenger , doen , ycladd , harrowd , purchas , raught , seely , stowre , swinge , owch , and withouten . He also employs many old words from Layamon , Wiclif , and Langland , like swelt , younglings , noye , kest , hurtle , and loft . His dialectic forms are taken from the vernacular of the North Lancashire folk with which he was familiar . Some are still a part of the spoken language of that region , such as , brent , cruddled , forswat , fearen , forray , pight , sithen , carle , and carke .</p>
   <p>Examples of his use of classical constructions are : the ablative absolute , as , which doen ( IV , xliii ) ; the relative construction with when , as , which when ( I , xvii ) , that when ( VII , xi ) ; the comparative of the adjective in the sense of “ too , ” as , weaker ( I , xlv ) , harder ( II , xxxvi ) ; the participial construction after till , as , till further tryall made ( I , xii ) ; the superlative of location , as , middest ( IV , xv ) ; and the old gerundive , as , wandering wood ( I , xiii ) . Most of the gallicisms found are anglicized loan words from the French romans d'aventure , such as , disseized , cheare , chappell , assoiled , guerdon , palfrey , recreaunt , trenchand , syre , and trusse . Notwithstanding Spenser 's use of foreign words and constructions , his language is as thoroughly English in its idiom as that of any of our great poets .</p>
   <p>“ I think that if he had not been a great poet , ” says Leigh Hunt , “ he would have been a great painter . ”</p>
   <p>“ After reading , ” says Pope , “ a canto of Spenser two or three days ago to an old lady , between seventy and eighty years of age , she said that I had been showing her a gallery of pictures . I do not know how it is , but she said very right . There is something in Spenser that pleases one as strongly in old age as it did in youth . I read the Faerie Queene when I was about twelve , with infinite delight ; and I think it gave me as much , when I read it over about a year or two ago . ”</p>
   <p>The imperishable charm of the poem lies in its appeal to the pure sense of beauty . “ A beautiful pagan dream , ” says Taine , “ carries on a beautiful dream of chivalry . ” The reader hears in its lines a stately and undulating rhythm that intoxicates the ear and carries him on with an irresistible fascination , he sees the unsubstantial forms of fairyland go sweeping by in a gorgeous and dreamlike pageantry , and he feels pulsing in its luxuriant and enchanted atmosphere the warm and beauty-loving temper of the Italian Renaissance . “ Spenser is superior to his subject , ” says Taine , “ comprehends it fully , frames it with a view to the end , in order to impress upon it the proper mark of his soul and his genius . Each story is modified with respect to another , and all with respect to a certain effect which is being worked out . Thus a beauty issues from this harmony ,— the beauty in the poet 's heart ,— which his whole work strives to express ; a noble and yet a laughing beauty , made up of moral elevation and sensuous seductions , English in sentiment , Italian in externals , chivalric in subject , modern in its perfection , representing a unique and admirable epoch , the appearance of paganism in a Christian race , and the worship of form by an imagination of the North . ”</p>

   <p>TO THE RIGHT NOBLE AND VALOROUS</p>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>SIR WALTER RALEIGH , KNIGHT .</head>
     <l n="1">Lo : Wardein of the Stanneries , and her majesties lieutenaunt of the</l>
     <l n="2">countie of Cornewayll .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>SIR ,</p>
   <p>Knowing how doubtfully all Allegories may be constructed , and this booke of mine , which I have entituled The Faery Queene , being a continued Allegorie , or darke conceit , I have thought good , as well for avoyding of jealous opinions and misconstructions , as also for your better light in reading thereof , ( being so , by you commanded ) to discover unto you the generall intention and meaning , which in the whole course thereof I have fashioned , without expressing of any particular purposes , or by-accidents therein occasioned . The generall end therefore of all the booke , is to fashion a gentleman or noble person in vertuous and gentle discipline . Which for that I conceived shoulde be most plausible and pleasing , beeing coloured with an historicall fiction , the which the most part of men delight to read , rather for varietie of matter than for profit of the ensample : I chose the historie of king Arthure , as most fit for the excellencie of his person , beeing made famous by many mens former workes , and also furthest from the danger of envie , and suspicion of present time . In which I have followed all the antique poets historicall : first Homer , who in the persons of Agamemnon and Ulysses hath ensampled a good governour and a vertuous man , the one in his Ilias , the other in his Odysseis : then Virgil , whose like intention was to doe in the person of Æneas : after him Ariosto comprised them both in his Orlando : and lately Tasso dissevered them againe , and formed both parts in two persons , namely , that part which they in philosophy call Ethice , or vertues of a private man , coloured in his Rinaldo : the other named Politice , in his Godfredo . By ensample of which excellent Poets , I laboure to pourtraict in Arthure , before he was king , the image of a brave knight , perfected in the twelve private morall vertues , as Aristotle hath devised : which if I find to be well accepted , I may be perhaps encoraged to frame the other part of pollitike vertues in his person , after he came to bee king .</p>
   <p>To some I know this Methode will seem displeasant , which had rather have good discipline delivered plainly in way of precepts , or sermoned at large , as they use , then thus clowdily enwrapped in Allegoricall devises . But such , mee seeme , should be satisfied with the use of these dayes , seeing all things accounted by their showes , and nothing esteemed of , that is not delightfull and pleasing to common sense . For this cause is Xenophon preferred before Plato , for that the one , in the exquisite depth of his judgement , formed a Commune-wealth , such as it should be ; but the other , in the person of Cyrus and the Persians , fashioned a government , such as might best be : So much more profitable and gracious is doctrine by ensample then by rule . So have I laboured to do in the person of Arthure : whom I conceive , after his long education by Timon ( to whom he was by Merlin delivered to be brought up , so soone as he was borne of the Lady Igrayne ) to have seen in a dreame or vision the Faerie Queene , with whose excellent beautie ravished , hee awaking , resolved to seek her out : and so , being by Merlin armed , and by Timon throughly instructed , he went to seeke her forth in Faery land . In that Faery Queene I mean Glory in my generall intention : but in my particular I conceive the most excellent and glorious person of our soveraine the Queene , and her kingdome in Faery land . And yet , in some places else , I doe otherwise shadow her . For considering shee beareth two persons , the one of a most royall Queene or Empresse , the other of a most vertuous and beautifull lady , this latter part in some places I doe expresse in Belphoebe , fashioning her name according to your owne excellent conceipt of Cynthia ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>( Phoebe and Cynthia being both names of Diana ) . So in the person of Prince Arthure I sette forth magnificence in particular , which vertue , for that ( according to Aristotle and the rest ) it is the perfection of all the rest , and containeth in it them all , therefore in the whole course I mention the deeds of Arthure appliable to the vertue , which I write of in that booke . But of the twelve other vertues I make XII other knights the patrons , for the more varietie of the historic : Of which these three bookes containe three . The first , of the Knight of the Red crosse , in whom I expresse Holinesse : the second of Sir Guyon , in whome I set foorth Temperance : the third of Britomartis , a Lady knight , in whom I picture Chastitie . But because the beginning of the whole worke seemeth abrupt and as depending upon other antecedents , it needs that yee know the occasion of these three knights severall adventures . For the Methode of a Poet historicall is not such as of an Historiographer . For an Historiographer discourseth of affaires orderly as they were done , accounting as well the times as the actions ; but a Poet thrusteth into the middest , even where it most concerneth him , and there recoursing to the things forepast , and divining of things to come , maketh a pleasing analysis of all . The beginning therefore of my historie , if it were to be told by an Historiographer , should be the twelfth booke , which is the last ; where I devise that the Faery Queene kept her annuall feast twelve daies ; uppon which twelve severall dayes , the occasions of the twelve severall adventures hapned , which being undertaken by XII severall knights , are in these twelve books severally handled and discoursed .</p>
   <p>The first was this . In the beginning of the feast , there presented him selfe a tall clownish younge man , who falling before the Queene of Faeries desired a boone ( as the manner then was ) which during that feast she might not refuse : which was that hee might have the atchievement of any adventure , which during that feast should happen ; that being granted , he rested him selfe on the fioore , unfit through his rusticitie for a better place . Soone after entred a faire Ladie in mourning weedes , riding on a white Asse , with a dwarfe behind her leading a warlike steed , that bore the Armes of a knight , and his speare in the dwarfes hand . She falling before the Queene of Faeries , complayned that her father and mother , an ancient King and Queene , had bene by an huge dragon many yeers shut up in a brazen Castle , who thence suffered them not to issew : and therefore besought the Faery Queene to assigne her some one of her knights to take on him that exployt . Presently that clownish person upstarting , desired that adventure ; whereat the Queene much wondering , and the Lady much gaine-saying , yet he earnestly importuned his desire . In the end the Lady told him , that unlesse that armour which she brought would serve him ( that is , the armour of a Christian man specified by Saint Paul , V . Ephes . ) that he could not succeed in that enterprise : which being forth with put upon him with due furnitures thereunto , he seemed the goodliest man in al that company , and was well liked of the Lady . And eftesoones taking on him knighthood , and mounting on that straunge Courser , he went forth with her on that adventure : where beginneth the first booke , viz .</p>
   <p>A gentle knight was pricking on the playne , etc .</p>
   <p>The second day there came in a Palmer bearing an Infant with bloody hands , whose Parents he complained to have bene slaine by an enchauntresse called Acrasia : and therefore craved of the Faery Queene , to appoint him some knight to performe that adventure , which being assigned to Sir Guyon , he presently went foorth with the same Palmer : which is the beginning of the second booke and the whole subject thereof . The third day there came in a Groome , who complained before the Faery Queene , that a vile Enchaunter , called Busirane , had in hand a most faire Lady , called Amoretta , whom he kept in most grevious torment . Whereupon Sir Scudamour , the lover of that Lady , presently tooke on him that adventure . But beeing unable to performe it by reason of the hard Enchauntments , after long sorrow , in the end met with Britomartis , who succoured him , and reskewed his love .</p>
   <p>But by occasion hereof , many other adventures are intermedled ; but rather as accidents then intendments . As the love of Britomart , the overthrow of Marinell , the miserie of Florimell , the vertuousness of Belphoebe ; and many the like .</p>
   <p>Thus much , Sir , I have briefly-over-run to direct your understanding to the wel-head of the History , that from thence gathering the whole intention of the conceit , ye may as in a handfull gripe all the discourse , which otherwise may happely seem tedious and confused . So humbly craving the continuance of your honourable favour towards me , and th ’ eternall establishment of your happines , I humbly take leave .</p>
   <p>Yours most humbly affectionate ,</p>

    <head>NOTES</head>
    <p n="1">LINE 1 . LO I THE MAN .... An imitation of the opening lines of Vergil 's Aeneid :—</p>
    <p n="2">“ Ille ego , qui quondam gracili modulatus avena Carmen ,... Gratum opus agricolis , at nunc horrentia Martis . ”</p>
    <p n="3">Referring to his Shepheards Calender ( 1579 ) Spenser thus gracefully indicates his change from pastoral to epic poetry .</p>
    <p n="4">5-9 . KNIGHTS AND LADIES . The poet here imitates the opening of Ariosto 's Orlando Furioso .</p>
    <p n="5">10 . O HOLY VIRGIN CHIEFE OF NINE , refers to Clio , the muse of history . Spenser should have invoked Calliope , the muse of poetry .</p>
    <p n="6">14 . OF FAERIE KNIGHTS , the the champions of Gloriana , the queen of Faerieland . FAIREST TANAQUILL , a British princess , daughter of Oberon , king of Faerieland . In the allegory she is Queen Elizabeth .</p>
    <p n="7">15 . THAT MOST NOBLE BRITON PRINCE is Prince Arthur , the perfect knight , who is in love with Gloriana . In the allegory the Earl of Leicester is probably meant , though by one tradition Sir Philip Sidney is identified with Prince Arthur .</p>
    <p n="8">19 . IMPE OF HIGHEST JOVE , Cupid , the god of love , and son of Jupiter and Venus . He is represented as armed with an ebony bow ( l. 23 ) .</p>
    <p n="9">25 . TRIUMPHANT MART , Mars , the god of war . The spelling is that of the Italians and Chaucer .</p>
    <p n="10">28 . O GODDESSE HEAVENLY BRIGHT , Queen Elizabeth ( aged 56 ) , who was fond of such extravagant flattery , and expected it of all her courtiers .</p>
    <p n="11">31 . PHOEBUS LAMPE , Apollo , the sun-god .</p>
    <p n="12">34 . GLORIOUS TYPE OF THINE , the Lady Una , who stands for Truth in the allegory .</p>
    <p n="13">35 . THE ARGUMENT OF MINE AFFLICTED STILE , the subject of my humble pen . “ Afflicted ” has the original Latin sense of “ cast down . ”</p>
    <p n="14">36 . O DEAREST DRED , O beloved object of reverence ; a common salutation of royalty .</p>
    <p n="15">CANTO I</p>
    <p n="16">I . The Plot : At the bidding of Gloriana , the Redcross Knight undertakes to deliver Una 's parents from a dragon who holds them captive . He sets out upon his quest attended by a dwarf and guided by Una , mounted on an ass and leading a lamb . They are driven by a storm into a forest , where they discover the cave of Error , who is slain by the Knight . They are then beguiled into the house of Archimago , an old enchanter . By his magic he leads the Knight in a dream to believe that Una is false to him , and thus separates them .</p>
    <p n="17">II . The Allegory : 1 . Holiness , the love of God , united with Truth , the knowledge of God , is to deliver man from the thraldom of the Devil . Together they are able to overthrow Error ; but Hypocrisy deceitfully alienates Holiness from Truth by making the latter appear unworthy of love .</p>
    <p n="18">2 . There is a hint of the intrigues of the false Roman church and the treacherous Spanish king , Philip II , to undermine the religious and political freedom of the English people . The English nation , following the Reformed church , overthrows the Catholic faith , but is deceived by the machinations of Spanish diplomacy .</p>
    <p n="19">LINE 1 . A GENTLE KNIGHT , the Redcross Knight , representing the church militant , and Reformed England . He is the young , untried champion of the old cause whose struggles before the Reformation are referred to in ll . 3 , 4 . His shield bore “ a cross gules upon a field argent , ” a red cross on a silver ground . See The Birth of St. George in Percy 's Reliques , iii , 3 , and Malory 's Morte d'Arthur , iii , 65 .</p>
    <p n="20">15 . FOR SOVERAINE HOPE , as a sign of the supreme hope .</p>
    <p n="21">20 . GREATEST GLORIANA , Queen Elizabeth . In other books of The Faerie Queene she is called Belphoebe , the patroness of chastity , and Britomart , the military genius of Britain .</p>
    <p n="22">27 . A DRAGON , “ the great dragon , that old serpent , called the devil , ” Revelation , xii , 9 , also Rome and Spain . Cf . legend of St. George and the dragon , and Fletcher 's Purple Island , vii seq .</p>
    <p n="23">28 . A LOVELY LADIE , Una , the personification of truth and true religion . Her lamb symbolizes innocence .</p>
    <p n="24">46 . A DWARFE , representing prudence , or common sense ; according to Morley , the flesh .</p>
    <p n="25">56 . A SHADIE GROVE , the wood of Error . “ By it Spenser shadows forth the danger surrounding the mind that escapes from the bondage of Roman authority and thinks for itself . ” — Kitchin . The description of the wood is an imitation of Ariosto 's Orlando Furioso , i , 37 , Chaucer 's Assembly of Foules , 176 , and Tasso 's Jerusalem Delivered , iii , 75 . Morley sees in this grove an allegory of man 's life , the trees symbolizing trade , pleasure , youth , etc .</p>
    <p n="26">69 . THE SAYLING PINE . Ships were built of pine .</p>
    <p n="27">70 . THE LOPLAR NEVER DRY , because it grows best in moist soil .</p>
    <p n="28">71 . THE BUILDER OAKE . In the Middle Ages most manor houses and churches were built of oak .</p>
    <p n="29">72 . THE CYPRESSE FUNERALL , an emblem of death among the ancients , and sacred to Pluto . Sidney says that they were wont to dress graves with cypress branches in old times .</p>
    <p n="30">73 . THE LAURELL . Victors at the Pythian games and triumphing Roman generals were crowned with laurel . It was also sacred to Apollo , the god of poetry , hence “ meed of poets sage . ”</p>
    <p n="31">74 . THE FIRRE THAT WEEPETH STILL . The fir exudes resinous substance .</p>
    <p n="32">75 . THE WILLOW . “ Willows : a sad tree , whereof such who have lost their love make their mourning garlands . ” — Fuller 's Worthies , i , 153 . Cf . Heywood 's Song of the Green Willow , and Desdemona 's song in Othello , IV , iii , 39 .</p>
    <p n="33">76 . THE EUGH . Ascham in his Toxophilus tells us that the best bows were made of yew .</p>
    <p n="34">78 . THE MIRRHE , the Arabian myrtle , which exudes a bitter but fragrant gum . The allusion is to the wounding of Myrrha by her father and her metamorphosis into this tree .</p>
    <p n="35">79 . THE WARLIKE BEECH , because lances and other arms were made of it . THE ASH FOR NOTHING ILL. “ The uses of the ash is one of the most universal : it serves the souldier , the carpenter , the wheelwright , cartwright , cooper , turner , and thatcher . ” — Evelyn 's Sylva . The great tree Igdrasil in the northern mythology was an ash .</p>
    <p n="36">81 . THE CARVER HOLME , or evergreen oak , was good for carving .</p>
    <p n="37">106 . SHAME WERE TO REVOKE , etc ., it would be cowardly not to go forward for fear of some suspected unseen danger .</p>
    <p n="38">114 . THE WANDRING WOOD , i. e . which causes men to go astray .</p>
    <p n="39">123 . MONSTER . The description of the monster Error , or Falsehood , is based on Hesiod 's Echidna , Theog . 301 , and the locusts in Revelation , ix , 7-10 . She is half human , half serpent , because error is partly true and partly false . Dante 's Fraud and Milton 's Sin are similar monsters .</p>
    <p n="40">126 . FULL OF VILE DISDAINE , full of vileness that bred disgust in the beholder .</p>
    <p n="41">130 . OF HER THERE BRED , etc ., of her were born a thousand young ones . Her offspring are lies and rumors of many shapes .</p>
    <p n="42">141 . ARMED TO POINT , completely armed . Cf . Fr . à point , to a nicety .</p>
    <p n="43">145 . THE VALIANT ELFE , because he was the reputed son of an Elfin or Faerie , though really sprung from “ an ancient race of Saxon kings . ” Three kinds of elves are mentioned in the Edda : the black dwarfs , and brownies , who both dwelt under ground , and the fair elves , who dwelt in Fairyland or Alfheim . “ The difference between Spenser 's elves and these Teutonic elves shows how he perverts Fairy mythology in the same way as he does Classical myths . ” — Percival .</p>
    <p n="44">168 . HIS GALL DID GRATE FOR GRIEFE , his anger was aroused on account of pain . In the old anatomy anger had its seat in the gallbladder . See Burton 's Anatomy of Melancholy , I , i , 2 .</p>
    <p n="45">177 . HER VOMIT FULL OF BOOKES , etc . From 1570 , when Pope Sixtus V issued his bull of deposition against Queen Elizabeth , to 1590 , great numbers of scurrilous pamphlets attacking the Queen and the Reformed church had been disseminated by Jesuit refugees .</p>
    <p n="46">181 . NILUS . Pliny believed that the mud of the Nile had the power of breeding living creatures like mice . Hist . Nat . ix , 84 . So Shakespeare , Antony and Cleopatra , II , vii , 29 .</p>
    <p n="47">199 . GENTLE SHEPHEARD . In this pastoral simile , Spenser imitates Homer 's Iliad , ii , 469 , and xvii , 641 , and Ariosto 's Orlando Furioso , xiv , 109 .</p>
    <p n="48">208 . THUS ILL BESTEDD . There is a similar combat in the old romance Guy of Warwick , ix , between the hero and a man-eating dragon .</p>
    <p n="49">217 . HER SCATTRED BROOD . The poet here follows a belief as old as Pliny that the young of serpents fed on their mother 's blood . In this entire passage the details are too revolting for modern taste .</p>
    <p n="50">232 . THE WHICH THEM NURST . The antecedent of which is her . In the sixteenth century the was frequently placed before which , which was also the equivalent of who . Cf . the Lord 's Prayer .</p>
    <p n="51">234 . HE SHOULD CONTEND , he should have had to contend .</p>
    <p n="52">237 . BORNE UNDER HAPPY STARRE . Belief in astrology was once common , and Spenser being a Pythagorean would hold the doctrine of the influence of the stars on human destiny .</p>
    <p n="53">239 . THAT ARMORIE , the armor of the Christian warrior . Ephesians , vi , 13 .</p>
    <p n="54">243 . THAT LIKE SUCCEED IT MAY , that like successful adventures may succeed it . The word order is inverted for the sake of the rhyme .</p>
    <p n="55">250 . TO FREND , as his friend .</p>
    <p n="56">254 . AN AGED SIRE , the false enchanter , Archimago , or Hypocrisy , who is supposed to represent Pope Sixtus V or King Philip II of Spain . In general he stands for false religion or the Church of Rome . The character and adventure are taken from Orlando Furioso , ii , 12 , in which there is a hypocritical hermit . The Knight at first takes Archimago to be a palmer , and inquires for the foreign news .</p>
    <p n="57">295 . TAKE UP YOUR IN , take lodging .</p>
    <p n="58">301 . A LITTLE WYDE , a little way off .</p>
    <p n="59">315 . AN AVE-MARY , Hail Mary , a prayer to the Virgin . Cf . Luke , i , 28 .</p>
    <p n="60">317 . THE SAD HUMOUR , the heavy moisture , or “ slombring deaw . ”</p>
    <p n="61">318 . MORPHEUS , the son of Somnus and god of sleep and dreams , who sprinkled the dew of sleep on the brow of mortals from his horn or wings or from a bough dipped in Lethe .</p>
    <p n="62">323 . HIS MAGICK BOOKES AND ARTES . Monks engaged in scientific investigation , such as Friar Roger Bacon , were popularly supposed to use cabalistic books , and to make compacts with the Devil by means of necromancy , or the black art , as in st. xxxvii . Before the close of the century Marlowe 's Doctor Faustus and Greene 's Friar Bacon and Friar Bungay , both based on the popular belief in magic , were presented on the London stage .</p>
    <p n="63">328 . BLACKE PLUTOES GRIESLY DAME , Proserpine , the avenger of men , and inflicter of curses on the dead . She is identified with Shakespeare 's Hecate , the goddess of sorcery , and with Milton 's Cotytto , goddess of lust . To this latter sin the knight is tempted .</p>
    <p n="64">332 . GREAT GORGON , Demogorgon , whose name might not be uttered , a magician who had power over the spirits of the lower world . The poet is here imitating the Latin poets Lucan and Statius .</p>
    <p n="65">333 . COCYTUS , the river of wailing , and STYX , the river of hate , both in Hades . There were two others , Acheron , the river of sorrow , and Phlegethon , the river of fire .</p>
    <p n="66">335 . LEGIONS OF SPRIGHTS . In this stanza and the preceding Spenser follows Tasso 's Jerusalem Delivered , xiii , 6-11 , where the magician Ismeno , guarding the Enchanted Wood , conjures “ legions of devils ” with the “ mighty name ” ( l. 332 ) .</p>
    <p n="67">339 . CHOSE . Imitation of Ariosto 's Orlando Furioso , ii , 15 , in which a false spirit is called up by a hypocritical hermit . The description of the House of Sleep in st. xxxix seq . is modelled on the same poet , Orlando Furioso , ii , 15 seq . The influence of Homer 's Odyssey , xi , 16 is seen in st. xxxix , ll . 348 seq .</p>
    <p n="68">348 . TETHYS , the ocean . In classical mythology she is the daughter of Uranus ( heaven ) and Gaea ( earth ) , and the wife of Oceanus .</p>
    <p n="69">349 . CYNTHIA , the moon . The allusion is to the story of Diana and Endymion . See Lyly 's play Endymion .</p>
    <p n="70">352 . WHOSE DOUBLE GATES . Homer , Odyssey , xix , 562 , and Vergil , Aeneid , vi , 893 , give the House of Dreams a horn and an ivory gate . Spenser substitutes silver for horn , mirrors being overlaid with silver in his time . From the ivory gate issued false dreams ; from the other , true ones .</p>
    <p n="71">361 . SLUMBER SOFT . This stanza shows Spenser 's wonderful technique . His exquisite effects are produced , it will be noticed , partly by the choice of musical words and partly by the rhythmical cadence of the verse phrases . It is an example of perfect “ keeping , ” or adaptation of sound to sense . Cf . Chaucer 's description of the waterfalls in the Cave of Sleep in his Boke of the Duchesse , 162 .</p>
    <p n="72">376 . WHOSE DRYER BRAINE , whose brain too dry . In the old physiology , a dry brain was the cause of slow and weak perception , and a moist brain of quickness .</p>
    <p n="73">378 . ALL , entirely , altogether .</p>
    <p n="74">381 . HECATE , queen of phantoms and demons in Hades , and mistress of witches on earth . See xxxvii .</p>
    <p n="75">387 . THE SLEEPERS SENT , the sleeper 's sense .</p>
    <p n="76">405 . MOST LIKE TO SEEME , etc .. most likely fit to seem for ( represent ) Una . Like is an adv . A very awkward inversion .</p>
    <p n="77">411 . BORNE WITHOUT HER DEW , i. e . created by him in an unnatural manner .</p>
    <p n="78">425 . FAYRE VENUS , the daughter of Jupiter , or Zeus , and the sea-nymph Dione . She is the same as Aphrodite , the Greek goddess of love and beauty .</p>
    <p n="79">430 . THE GRACES , Euphrosyne , Aglaia , and Thalia , daughters of Zeus and Aphrodite .</p>
    <p n="80">431 . HYMEN IÖ HYMEN , refrain of an old Roman nuptial song . Hymen , the son of Apollo and the Muse Urania , was the god of marriage .</p>
    <p n="81">432 . FRESHEST FLORA , the goddess of flowers . She typified spring .</p>
    <p n="82">447 . TO PROVE HIS SENSE , etc . To test his perception and prove her feigned truth .</p>
    <p n="83">449 . THO CAN SHE WEEPE , then did she weep . Can here is the Northern dialect form for the middle English gan , past tense of ginnen , to begin , which was used as an auxiliary .</p>
    <p n="84">454 . THE BLIND GOD , Cupid , Eros , or Amor , the god of love .</p>
    <p n="85">478 . Like other knights of romance , e. g . Sir Galahad and Sir Gareth in Malory 's Morte d'Arthur , iii , 65 , etc ., the Redcross Knight does not yield to the temptation of the flesh , but overcomes it .</p>

    <p n="91">CANTO II</p>
    <p n="92">I . The Plot : Deceived by Archimago 's phantoms , the Redcross Knight suspects the chastity of Una , and flies at early dawn with his dwarf . He chances to meet the Saracen Sansfoy in company with the false Duessa . They do battle and Sansfoy is slain . Duessa under the name of Fidessa attaches herself to the Knight , and they ride forward . They stop to rest under some shady trees , On breaking a bough , the Knight discovers that the trees are two lovers , Fradubio and Fraelissa , thus imprisoned by the cruel enchantment of Duessa .</p>
    <p n="93">II . The Allegory : 1 . Hypocrisy under a pious disguise is attractive to Holiness . Truth is also deceived by it , and shamefully slandered . Holiness having abandoned Truth , takes up with Falsehood , who is attended by Infidelity . Unbelief when openly assailing Holiness is overthrown , but Falsehood under the guise of Faith remains undiscovered . The fate of the man ( Fradubio ) is set forth who halts between two opinions ,— False Religion ( Duessa ) and Heathen Philosophy , or Natural Religion ( Fraelissa ) .</p>
    <p n="94">2 . The Reformed Church , no longer under the guidance of Truth , rushes headlong into Infidelity , and unwittingly became the defender of the Romish Faith under the name of the True Faith . There is a hint of the intrigues of Mary Queen of Scots and the libels of the Jesuits on Queen Elizabeth designed to bring back the English nation to Romish allegiance .</p>
    <p n="95">LINE 1 . THE NORTHERNE WAGONER , the constellation Boötes .</p>
    <p n="96">2 . HIS SEVENFOLD TEME , the seven stars of Ursa Major , or Charles 's Wain . THE STEDFAST STARRE , the Pole-star , which never sets .</p>
    <p n="97">6 . CHEAREFULL CHAUNTICLERE , the name of the cock in the fabliaux and beast epics , e. g . Roman de Renart and Reineke Fuchs .</p>
    <p n="98">7 . PHOEBUS FIERY CARRE , the sun .</p>
    <p n="99">11 . THAT FAIRE-FORGED SPRIGHT , fair but miscreated spirit ( I , xiv ) . Spenser took suggestions for this stanza from Ariosto and Tasso .</p>
    <p n="100">51 . FAIRE HESPERUS , the evening star .</p>
    <p n="101">55 . THE ROSY-FINGRED MORNING . This beautiful epithet of Aurora , the goddess of the dawn , is borrowed from Homer , Hesiod , and other ancient poets .</p>
    <p n="102">56 . AGED TITHONES , son of Laomedon , King of Troy . Aurora conferred upon him immortality without youth , hence the epithet “ aged . ”</p>
    <p n="103">58 . TITAN , the sun-god in the Roman myths .</p>
    <p n="104">85 . PROTEUS , a sea-god who was endowed with the power of prophecy . He could change himself into any shape in order to avoid having to prophesy . See Homer , Odyssey , iv , 366 seq ., and Vergil , Georgics , iv , 387 .</p>
    <p n="105">90 . HERBES . In the sixteenth century the belief in potions , magic formulas , etc ., was still strongly rooted in the popular mind . The Spanish court and the priests were supposed to employ supernatural agencies against the Protestants .</p>
    <p n="106">105 . A FAITHLESS SARAZIN . Spenser uses the word Saracen in the general sense of pagan . During the Middle Ages the Saracen power was a menace to Europe , and the stronghold of infidelity . The names of the three Paynim brethren , Sansfoy , Sansjoy , and Sansloy ,— faithless , joyless , and lawless ,— suggest the point of view of Spenser 's age .</p>
    <p n="107">109 . A FAIRE COMPANION , the enchantress Duessa , or Falsehood , who calls herself Fidessa . In the allegory Spenser intended her to represent the Romish church and Mary Queen of Scots . Her character and appearance were suggested by the woman of Babylon , in Revelation , viii , 4 , Ariosto 's Alcina , and Tasso 's Armida .</p>
    <p n="108">136 . AS WHEN TWO RAMS . This figure is found in Vergil , Apollonius , Malory , Tasso , Dante , and other poets and romancers .</p>
    <p n="109">141 . THE HANGING VICTORY , the victory which hung doubtful in the balance .</p>
    <p n="110">144 . THE BROKEN RELIQUES , the shattered lances .</p>
    <p n="111">148 . EACH OTHERS EQUALL PUISSAUNCE ENVIES , each envies the equal prowess of the other .</p>
    <p n="112">149 . THROUGH THEIR IRON SIDES , etc ., through their armored sides with cruel glances , etc .</p>
    <p n="113">155 . THE BITTER FIT , the bitterness of death .</p>

    <p n="151">CANTO III</p>
    <p n="152">I . The Plot : Una wandering in quest of her Knight is guarded by a Lion . With difficulty they gain entrance to the cottage of Corceca and her daughter Abessa , the paramour of Kirkrapine . The latter is killed by the Lion . Fleeing the next day , Una falls in with Archimago disguised as the Redcross Knight . They journey on and meet a second Saracen knight , Sansloy . In the fight which ensues Archimago is unhorsed and his deception unmasked . The Lion is slain , and Una becomes the captive of Sansloy .</p>
    <p n="153">II . The Allegory : 1 . Truth finds temporary protection in Reason , or Natural Honor ( Lion ) , and with its help puts a stop to the Robbing of Churches ( Kirkrapine ) , which is connived at by Blind Devotion ( Corceca ) and Secret Sin ( Abessa ) . Truth is then associated with Hypocrisy under the guise of Holiness , but it is soon unmasked by Lawlessness ( Sansloy ) , with which Truth is forced into an unnatural alliance .</p>
    <p n="154">2 . “ The lion is said to represent Henry VIII , overthrowing the monasteries , destroying church-robbers , disturbing the dark haunts of idleness , ignorance and superstition . ” — Kitchin . The battle between Archimago and Sansloy refers to the contests of the Catholic powers with the Moslems .

Similar scenes are found in Sir Bevis of Hampton , The Seven Champions of Christendom , etc . Cf . I Henry IV , ii , 4 .

    <p n="194">CANTO IV</p>
    <p n="195">I . The Plot : In this and the following canto the adventures of the Redcross Knight are continued from Canto II . Guided by Duessa , he enters the House of Pride . There he sees Lucifera , the Queen of Pride , attended by her sinful court . Her six Counselors are described in detail , with an account of a pleasure trip taken by the Queen and her court . Sansjoy unexpectedly arrives and challenges the Knight to mortal combat for the shield of Sansfoy . That night Duessa holds a secret conference with the Saracen knight .</p>
    <p n="196">II . The Allegory : 1 . The Christian Soldier , under the influence of false ideals ( Duessa ) , is exposed to the temptations of the Seven Deadly Sins , chief among which is Pride . In the midst of these sinful pleasures , he is assailed by Joylessness , on whose side is Falsehood secretly .</p>
    <p n="197">2 . The religious and political allegory is here vague and somewhat discontinuous . There is a hint , however , of the attempts of Mary Queen of Scots to bring England back to Romanism . The pride and corruption of the false church and its clergy are set forth . There is also a suggestion of the perilous position of the English in Ireland .</p>

    <p n="223">CANTO V</p>
    <p n="224">I . The Plot : ( a continuation of Canto IV ) . The Knight fights in the lists with Sansjoy and defeats him , but is prevented by Duessa 's magic from slaying him . Duessa descends to Erebus and obtains the aid of Night , who conveys the wounded Saracen in her chariot to Æsculapius to be healed of his wounds . The tortures of some of the souls in Erebus are described , particularly the cause of Æsculapius ’ punishment . A roll of the prisoners whom the dwarf discovers in Pride 's dungeon is given . The Knight flees with the dwarf from her house .</p>
    <p n="225">II . The Allegory : When the Christian Soldier is attacked by Joylessness , he has a far more desperate struggle than that with Infidelity , and comes out wounded though victorious . Joylessness when crushed by Holiness is restored by Pagan Philosophy . The backsliding Christian is warned in time by Prudence of the fearful consequences of sin , and hastens to turn his back on Pride and the other sins . The soul is led to dread Pride , not by Truth , but by its sufferings and other inferior motives .</p>

    <p n="247">267 . THE GHASTLY OWLE . The poet follows the Latin rather than the Greek poets , who regard the owl as the bird of wisdom .</p>

    <p n="249">298 . CERBERUS , the dog which guarded the lower regions . This stanza is an imitation of Vergil 's Æneid , vi , 417 seq . In Dante 's Inferno Vergil appeases him by casting handfuls of earth into his maw .</p>
    <p n="250">xxxv . In this stanza we see the influence of Homer and Vergil . Ixion , the king of Lapithæ , was chained by order of Zeus to a fiery-winged wheel for aspiring to the love of the goddess Hera ( Juno ) . Sisyphus had to roll a huge stone forever up a hill for betraying the designs of the gods . Tantalus , for divulging the secrets of Zeus , was condemned to stand tormented by thirst in a lake . Tityus , for an assault on Artemis , was pinioned to the ground with two vultures plucking at his vitals . Typhoeus , a hundred-headed giant , was slain by Zeus ’ thunderbolt , and buried under Ætna . The gin on which he was tortured was probably the rack of the Middle Ages . Cf . the bed of Procrustes . Theseus , for attempting to carry off Persephone , was fixed to a rock in Tartarus .

    <p n="283">CANTO VI</p>
    <p n="284">I . The Plot : ( Continuation of Canto III ) . Una is delivered from Sansloy by a band of Satyrs . She remains with them as their teacher . There a knight of the wild-wood , Sir Satyrane , discovers her , and by his assistance , Una succeeds in making her way out of the forest to the plain . On the way they meet Archimago , disguised as a pilgrim , and he deceives them and leads them to Sansloy . While Sir Satyrane and Sansloy are engaged in a bloody battle , Una flees . She is pursued by Archimago but makes her escape .</p>
    <p n="285">II . The Allegory : 1 . Truth is saved from destruction by Lawless Violence ( Sansloy ) by the aid of Barbarism or Savage Instinct , which terrorizes Lawlessness but offers natural homage to Truth . Truth finds a temporary home among Ignorant and Rude Folk ( Satyrs ) and in return imparts divine truth to their unregenerate minds . Natural Heroism or Manly Courage ( Sir Satyrane ) sides with Truth and defends it against Lawlessness .</p>
    <p n="286">2 . The religious allegory signifies the extension of Protestantism through the outlying rural districts of England and in Ireland . Upton thinks that Sir Satyrane represents “ Sir John Perrot , whose behaviour , though honest , was too coarse and rude for a court . ‘ Twas well known that he was a son of Henry VIII . ” Holinshed says that as Lord President of Munster , Sir John secured such peace and security that a man might travel in Ireland with a white stick only in his hand .</p>
    <p n="287">16 . FROM ONE TO OTHER YND , from the East to the West Indies .</p>
    <p n="288">61 . A TROUPE OF FAUNES AND SATYRES . The Fauns were the wood-gods of the Romans , the Satyrs the wood-gods of the Greeks . They were half human , half goat , and represented the luxuriant powers of nature .</p>
    <p n="289">63 . OLD SYLVANUS , the Roman god of fields and woods , young and fond of animal pleasures . Spenser represents him as a feeble but sensuous old man .</p>

    <p n="291">96 . RUSTICK HORROR , bristling hair .</p>

    <p n="301">134 . FAIRE DRYOPE , a princess of Æchalia , who became a forest nymph . Pholoe , mentioned in l. 135 , is probably a fictitious creation of the author 's .</p>
    <p n="302">146 . DEAREST CYPARISSE , a youth of Cea , who accidentally killed his favorite stag and dying of grief was changed into a cypress . He was beloved by Apollo and Sylvanus .</p>

    <p n="310">169 . IDOLATRYES . The allegory has reference to the idolatrous practices of the ignorant primitive Christians , such as the worship of images of the Saints , the pageant of the wooden ass during Lent ( see Matthew , xxi , and Brand 's Popular Antiquities , i , 124 ) , and the Feast of the Ass ( see Matthew , ii , 14 ) .</p>
    <p n="311">172 . A NOBLE WARLIKE KNIGHT , Sir Satyrane , in whom are united rude untaught chivalry and woodland savagery . He represents natural heroism and instinctive love of truth .</p>

    <p n="322">386 . This simile is found frequently in the old romances . Cf . Malory 's Morte d'Arthur , ii , 104 , and Chaucer 's Knight 's Tale , l. 1160 .</p>
    <p n="323">416 . According to a usage of chivalry , the lover wore a glove , sleeve , kerchief , or other token of his lady-love on his helmet . By “ lover 's token ” Sansloy ironically means a blow .</p>
    <p n="324">425 . TO HER LAST DECAY , to her utter ruin .</p>
    <p n="325">426 . Spenser leaves the fight between Sansloy and Sir Satyrane unfinished . Both warriors appear in later books of the Faerie Queene .</p>

    <p n="329">CANTO VII</p>
    <p n="330">I . The Plot : ( Continuation of Canto V ) . Duessa pursues the Redcross Knight , and overtakes him sitting by an enchanted fountain , weary and disarmed . He is beguiled into drinking from the fountain , and is quickly deprived of strength . In this unnerved and unarmed condition he is suddenly set upon by the giant Orgoglio . After a hopeless struggle he is struck down by the giant 's club and is thrust into a dungeon . Una is informed by the dwarf of the Knight 's misfortune and is prostrated with grief . Meeting Prince Arthur , she is persuaded to tell her story and receives promise of his assistance .</p>
    <p n="331">II . The Allegory : 1 . The Christian soldier , beguiled by Falsehood , doffs the armor of God , and indulges in sinful pleasures , and loses his purity . He then quickly falls into the power of Carnal Pride , or the brutal tyranny of False Religion ( Orgoglio ) . He can then be restored only by an appeal to the Highest Honor or Magnificence ( Prince Arthur ) through the good offices of Truth and Common Sense .</p>
    <p n="332">2 . In the reaction from the Reformation , Protestant England by dallying with Romanism ( Duessa , Mary Queen of Scots ) falls under the tyrannic power of the Pope ( Orgoglio ) , with whom Catholic England was coquetting . At this juncture National Honor and Consciousness comes to the relief of Protestantism . There is personal compliment to either Lord Leicester or Sir Philip Sidney .</p>
    <p n="333">19 . HE FEEDES UPON , he enjoys . A Latinism : cf . Vergil 's Æneid , iii .</p>
    <p n="334">37 . PHOEBE , a surname of Diana , or Artemis , the goddess of the moon .</p>
    <p n="335">45 . Spenser probably takes the suggestion from the fountain in the gardens of Armida in Tasso 's Jerusalem Delivered , xiv , 74 . Cf . also the fountain of Salmacis in Ovid 's Metamorphoses , xv , 819 seq .</p>
    <p n="336">56 . POURD OUT , a metaphor borrowed from Euripides ( Herac ., 75 ) and Vergil ( Æneid , ix , 317 ) .</p>
    <p n="337">62 . HIS LOOSER MAKE , his too dissolute companion .</p>
    <p n="338">67 . AN HIDEOUS GEANT , Orgoglio , symbolizing Inordinate Pride , and the Pope of Rome , who then claimed universal power over both church and state ( x ) . For a list of many other giants of romance see Brewer 's Handbook , pp . 376-379 .</p>
    <p n="339">104 . THAT DIVELISH YRON ENGIN , cannon . The invention of artillery by infernal ingenuity is an old conception of the poets . There is a suggestion of it in Vergil 's Æneid , vi , 585 seq ., which is elaborated in Ariosto 's Orlando Furioso , ix , 91 , which Milton in turn imitated in Paradise Lost , vi , 516 seq . So in the romance of Sir Triamour .</p>
    <p n="340">112 . TH ’ ONELY BREATH , the mere breath .</p>
    <p n="341">119 . DO HIM NOT TO DYE , slay him not ; cf . “ done to death . ”</p>

    <p n="343">139 . This refers to the Romish policy of fostering ignorance among its members .</p>
    <p n="344">140 . THAT RENOWMED SNAKE , the Lernæan Hydra , a monster with nine or more heads , offspring of Typhon and Echidna . It was slain by Hercules . STREMONA is a name of Spenser 's own invention .</p>

    <p n="349">165 . MONIMENTS , the sorrowful , mournful relics .</p>
    <p n="350">182 . SO HARDLY HE , etc . So he with difficulty coaxes the life which has flown to return into her body . According to the Platonic teaching , the body is the prison-house of the soul . Cf Psalms , cxlii , 7 .</p>
    <p n="351">202 . BUT SEELED UP WITH DEATH , but closed in death . “ Seel ” was a term in falconry , meaning “ to sew up ” ( the eyes of the hawk ) .</p>
    <p n="352">219 . THE BITTER BALEFULL STOUND , the bitter , grievous moment during which she listens to the story .</p>

    <p n="354">231 . SORROWFULL ASSAY , the assault of sorrow ( on her heart ) .</p>
    <p n="355">236 . WAS NEVER LADY , etc ., there never was lady who loved day ( life ) dearer .</p>
    <p n="356">249 . A GOODLY KNIGHT . Prince Arthur , son of King Uther Pendragon and Queen Ygerne , the model English gentleman , in whom all the virtues are perfected ( Magnificence ) . According to Upton and most editors , Prince Arthur represents Lord Leicester ; according to another tradition , Sir Philip Sidney . Could the author have possibly intended in him compliment to Sir Walter Raleigh ? See Spenser 's Letter to Raleigh . Arthur is the beau ideal of knighthood , and upon him the poet lavishes his richest descriptive powers . His armor , his shield Pridwen , his lance Roan , and sword Exculibur , were made by the great enchanter Merlin in the isle of Avallon .</p>
    <p n="357">259 . SHAPT LIKE A LADIES HEAD , an effigy of Queen Elizabeth , the Faerie Queene .</p>
    <p n="358">260 . LIKE HESPERUS , the evening star . Cf . Phosphorus , the morning star .</p>
    <p n="359">268 . The dragon couchant was also the crest of Arthur 's father , Uther , surnamed on this account Pen-dragon . The description in this stanza is imitated from Tasso 's description of the helmet of the Sultan in Jerusalem Delivered , ix , 25 , which in turn follows Vergil 's Æneid , vii , 785 seq .</p>
    <p n="360">280 . GREENE SELINIS , a town in Sicily .</p>
    <p n="361">284 . HIS WARLIKE SHIELD . Spenser here follows closely the description of the shield of the magician Atlante in Ariosto 's Orlando Furioso , ii , 55 .</p>
    <p n="362">300 . SILVER CYNTHIA , the moon . It was popularly supposed that magicians and witches had power to cause eclipses of the moon .</p>
    <p n="363">304 . All falsehood and deception . Truth and Wisdom are symbolized ( Upton ) .</p>
    <p n="364">306 . WHEN HIM LIST , when it pleased him . Him is dative .</p>
    <p n="365">314 . IT MERLIN WAS . Ambrose Merlin , the prince of enchanters , son of the nun Matilda , and an incubus , “ half-angel and half-man . ” He made , in addition to Prince Arthur 's armor and weapons , the Round Table for one hundred and fifty knights at Carduel , the magic fountain of love , and built Stonehenge on Salisbury Plain . He died spellbound by the sorceress Vivien in a hollow oak . See Tennyson 's Idylls of the King .</p>
    <p n="366">326 . DID TRAMPLE AS THE AIRE , curveted as lightly as the air .</p>
    <p n="367">335 . AND FOR HER HUMOUR , etc ., and to suit her ( sad ) mood framed fitting conversation .</p>
    <p n="368">355 . The subject of found is the substantive clause who ... impart .</p>
    <p n="369">xli . Observe the antithetical structure of this stanza , both in the Stichomuthia , or balance of line against line , and in the lines themselves . In this rapid word-play Arthur wins his point by appealing to Una 's faith .</p>
    <p n="370">363 . NO FAITH SO FAST , etc ., no faith is so firm that human infirmity may not injure it .</p>
    <p n="371">376 . Una , Truth , is the sole daughter of Eden .</p>

    <p n="373">381 . PHISON AND EUPHRATES , etc ., three of the four rivers that watered Eden , the Hiddekel being omitted . See Genesis , ii , 11-14 . In this stanza the poet strangely mixes Christian doctrine and the classical belief in the envy of the gods working the downfall of men .</p>

    <p n="384">QUESTIONS AND TOPICS</p>
    <p n="385">( Canto VII )</p>
    <p n="386">1 . Relate how the Knight fell into the hands of the Giant . 2 . Note the fine adaptation of sound to sense in vii . 3. Who were the parents and the foster-father of Orgoglio ? 4 . What are the principal characteristics of the giants of romance as seen in Orgoglio ? cf . with the giants in Pilgrim 's Progress . 5 . In the description of the giant do the last two lines ( viii ) add to or detract from the impression ? Why ? 6 . To whom does Spenser ascribe the invention of artillery ? 7 . Explain the allegory involved in the relations of Duessa and Orgoglio . 8 . How does Una act on hearing the news of the Knight 's capture ? 9 . What part does the Dwarf play ? 10 . Is Una just to herself in ll . 200-201 ? 11 . Is she over sentimental or ineffective — and is the pathos of her grief kept within the limits of the reader 's pleasure ? 12 . Express in your own words the main thought in xxii . 13 . Note the skillful summary of events in xxvi , and observe that this stanza is the Central Crisis and Pivotal Point of the whole Book . The fortunes of the Knight reach their lowest ebb and begin to turn . The first half of the Book has been the complication of the plot , the second half will be the resolution . 14 . Give a description of Prince Arthur . 15 . What mysterious power was possessed by his shield ? Cf . the Holy Grail . 16 . Observe carefully the scene between Una and Arthur , noting the changes in her mood . What light is thrown on her character ? What are her feelings toward the Knight ? 17 . Explain the various threads of allegory in this Canto .</p>
    <p n="387">CANTO VIII</p>
    <p n="388">I . The Plot : Prince Arthur and Una are conducted by the Dwarf to Orgoglio 's Castle . At the blast of the Squire 's horn the Giant comes forth attended by Duessa mounted on the seven-headed Beast . In the battle which ensues Arthur wounds the Beast , slays the Giant and captures Duessa . Prince Arthur finds the Redcross Knight half starved in a foul dungeon and releases him . Duessa is stripped of her gaudy clothes and allowed to hide herself in the wilderness .</p>
    <p n="389">II . The Allegory : 1 . Magnificence , the sum of all the virtues , wins the victory over Carnal Pride , and restores Holiness to its better half , Truth . With the overthrow of Pride , Falsehood , which is the ally of that vice , is stripped of its outward show and exposed in all its hideous deformity .</p>
    <p n="390">2 . The false Romish Church becomes drunk in the blood of the martyrs . There is a hint of the persecutions in the Netherlands , in Piedmont , of the massacre of St. Bartholomew 's Day and the burnings under Bloody Mary . Protestant England is delivered from Popish tyranny by the honor and courage of the English people . Militant England ( Prince Arthur ) is assisted by the clergy ( Squire ) with his horn ( Bible ) and is guided by Truth and Common Sense ( Dwarf ) .</p>
    <p n="391">23 . HORNE OF BUGLE SMALL , the English Bible . Spenser here imitates the description of the magic horn of Logistilla in Ariosto 's Orlando Furioso , xv , 15 , 53 .

Upton and Jortin emend delight to dislike ; Church inserts no before delight and omits best ; Kitchin suggests despight ; Grosart prefers the text as it stands with the meaning that although the best music pleases the troubled mind , it is no pleasure to renew the memory of past sufferings . I venture to offer still another solution , based on the context . When Una shows a desire to hear from her Knight a recountal of his sufferings in the dungeon , and he is silent , being loath to speak of them , Arthur reminds her that a change of subject is best , for the best music is that which breeds delight in the troubled ear .</p>
    <p n="414">xlvi . In this passage Spenser follows closely the description of the witch Alcina in Ariosto 's Orlando Furioso , vii , 73 .

    <p n="418">CANTO IX</p>
    <p n="419">I . The Plot : Prince Arthur tells Una of his vision of the Faerie Queene and of his quest for her . After exchanging presents with the Redcross Knight , he bids farewell to Una and her companions . These pursue their journey and soon meet a young knight , Sir Trevisan , fleeing from Despair . Sir Trevisan tells of his narrow escape from this old man , and unwillingly conducts the Redcross Knight back to his cave . The Knight enters and is almost persuaded to take his own life . He is saved by the timely interposition of Una . This is the most powerful canto of Book I .</p>
    <p n="420">II . The Allegory : 1 . The moral allegory in Canto VII presents the transition of the Soul ( Redcross ) from Pride to Sin ( Duessa ) through distrust of Truth ( Una ) , and it thus comes into the bondage of Carnal Pride ( Orgoglio ) . In Canto IX the Soul suffers a similar change from Sin to Despair . Having escaped from actual sin , but with spiritual life weakened , it almost falls a victim to Despair through excess of confidence and zeal to perform some good action . The Soul is saved by Truth , by which it is reminded to depend on the grace of God .</p>
    <p n="421">2 . The allegory on its religious side seems to have some obscure reference to the long and bitter controversies between Protestantism ( Calvinism ) and Roman Catholicism allied with infidelity .</p>

    <p n="472">CANTO X</p>
    <p n="473">I . The Plot : The Redcross Knight is conducted by Una to the House of Holiness , where they are welcomed by Dame Coelia and graciously entertained . The Knight is instructed by Fidelia , Speranza , and Charissa , the three daughters of Coelia , in his relations to God and his fellow-men . He is healed in body , and undergoes discipline for his sins . Mercy conducts him through the Hospital of Good Works , where he sees her seven Beadsmen . He then with Una climbs the Hill of Contemplation and hears from a holy man the story of his past with a prophecy of his future , and obtains a view of the City of Heaven .</p>
    <p n="474">This must be pronounced the most beautiful canto of the first book .</p>
    <p n="475">II . The Allegory : 1 . The Soul is brought by the Truth to a knowledge of the Heavenly Life ( Coelia ) , and is led , through repentance , to seek forgiveness and to desire a holier life . Having learned Faith and Hope , it acquires a zeal for Good Works ( Charity ) , and is strengthened by exercising Patience and Repentance . At last it enjoys a mood of happy Contemplation of the past with bright prospects for the future . The whole canto sets forth the beauty in a life of faith combined with good deeds .</p>
    <p n="476">2 . The religious allegory presents the doctrine , discipline , and spirit of Protestantism in the sixteenth century . A close parallel may be drawn between this canto and many things in Bunyan 's Pilgrim 's Progress . For his House of Holiness and its management , Spenser has no doubt taken many suggestions from the great manor house of some Elizabethan gentleman .</p>

    <p n="523">CANTO XI</p>
    <p n="524">I . The Plot : The Redcross Knight reaches the Brazen Tower in which Una 's parents , the King and Queen of Eden , are besieged by the Dragon . The monster is described . The first day 's fight is described , in which the Knight is borne through the air in the Dragon 's claws , wounds him under the wing with his lance , but is scorched by the flames from the monster 's mouth . The Knight is healed by a bath in the Well of Life . On the second day the Knight gives the Dragon several sword-wounds , but is stung by the monster 's tail and forced to retreat by the flames . That night he is refreshed and healed by the balm from the Tree of Life . On the third day he slays the Dragon by a thrust into his vitals .</p>
    <p n="525">II . The Allegory : 1 . Mankind has been deprived of Eden by Sin or Satan ( Dragon ) . The Christian overcomes the devil by means of the whole armor of God ( shield of faith , helmet of salvation , sword of the Spirit , etc . ) . The soul is strengthened by the ordinances of religion : baptism , regeneration , etc .</p>
    <p n="526">2 . There is a hint of the long and desperate struggle between Reformed England ( St. George ) and the Church of Rome , in which the power of the Pope and the King of Spain was broken in England , the Netherlands , and other parts of Europe . Some may see a remoter allusion to the delivery of Ireland from the same tyranny .</p>

    <p n="565">QUESTIONS AND TOPICS</p>
    <p n="566">( Canto XI )</p>
    <p n="567">1 . Describe the three days ’ fight between the Knight and the Dragon . 2 . What advantages does each gain ? 3 . Study the Dragon as a type of the conventional monster of romance , contrasting his brutal nature with the intellectuality and strategy of the Knight . 4 . Study the battle as an allegory of the victory of mind over matter , of virtue over vice , of Protestantism over Romanism . 5 . By what devices does Spenser obtain the effects of terror ? Mystery and terror are prime elements in romance . 6 . Find examples of another romantic characteristic , exaggeration . 7 . Do you think that in his use of hyperbole and impossibilities Spenser shows that he was deficient in a sense of humor ? 8 . Observe the lyric note in iii and liv . 9 . How does the poet impress the reader with the size of the Dragon ? 10 . Which Muse does he invoke ? 11 . Spenser 's poetry is richly sensuous : find passages in which he appeals to the sense of sight ( iv , viii , xiv ) , of sound ( iv , ix ) , of touch ( x , xi , vii ) , of smell ( xiii ) , of taste ( xiii ) , of pain ( xxxvii , xxvi , xxii ) , of motion ( x , xv , xviii ) . 12 . Where do you find an allegory of baptism ? Of regeneration ? Of the resurrection of Christ ( the three days ) ? 13 . Analyze the descriptions of the coming of darkness and of dawn .</p>
    <p n="568">CANTO XII</p>
    <p n="569">I . The Plot : The death of the dragon is announced by the watchman on the tower of the city , and Una 's parents , the King and Queen , accompanied by a great throng , come forth rejoicing at their deliverance . The Knight and Una are conducted with great honors into the palace . On the eve of their betrothal , Archimago suddenly appears as Duessa 's messenger and claims the Knight . Their wicked attempt is frustrated , and the pair are happily betrothed . After a long time spent in Una 's society , the Knight sets out to engage in the further service of the Faerie Queene .</p>
    <p n="570">II . The Allegory : Holiness , by conquering the devil , frees the whole human race from the tyranny of sin . It is embarrassed by the unexpected appearance of the consequences of its past sins , but makes a manly confession . In spite of hypocritical intrigues ( Archimago ) and false slanders ( Duessa ) , Holiness is united to Truth , thus forming a perfect character . The champion of the church militant responds cheerfully to the calls of duty and honor .</p>
    <p n="571">2 . Reformed England , having destroyed the brutal power of Rome , is firmly united to the truth in spite of the intrigues of the Pope to win it back to allegiance . It then goes forth against the King of Spain in obedience to the command of Queen Elizabeth .</p>
    <p n="572">3 . VERE THE MAINE SHETE , shift the mainsail , BEARE UP WITH THE LAND , direct the ship toward land .</p>
    <p n="573">25 . OUT OF HOND , at once .</p>
    <p n="574">43 . OF TALL YOUNG MEN . An allusion to Queen Elizabeth 's Pensioners , a band of the tallest and handsomest young men , of the best families and fortunes , that could be found ( Warton ) . ALL HABLE ARMES TO SOWND , all proper to wield armes .</p>
    <p n="575">57 . TO THE MAYDENS , to the accompaniment of the maidens ’ timbrels .</p>
    <p n="576">71 . IN HER SELF-RESEMBLANCE WELL BESEENE , looking well in her resemblance to her proper self , i. e . a king 's daughter .</p>
    <p n="577">73 . THE RASKALL MANY , the crowd of common people .</p>
    <p n="578">116 . OF GREAT NAME , of great celebrity , i. e . value .</p>
    <p n="579">117 . FITTING PURPOSE FRAME , held fitting conversation .</p>
    <p n="580">xiv . Kitchin and Percival think this whole passage a clever compliment to the parsimony of the Queen 's court .</p>
    <p n="581">161 . THAT PROUD PAYNIM KING , probably a reference to Philip of Spain .</p>
    <p n="582">168 . NOR DOEN UNDO , nor undo what has been done .</p>
    <p n="583">173 . IN SORT AS , even as .</p>
    <p n="584">205 . ALL WERE SHE , although she had been . IN PLACE , in various places .</p>
    <p n="585">313 . BAIT . In Spenser 's time bear-baiting was a favorite pastime of the people and received royal patronage .</p>
    <p n="586">328 . THE HOUSLING FIRE , the sacramental fire . Spenser seems here to have in mind , not the Christian housel or Eucharist , but the Roman marriage rites with their symbolic fire and water .</p>
    <p n="587">347 . TRINALL TRIPLICITIES , the threefold three orders of the celestial hierarchy according to the scholastic theologians . They were as follows : ( 1 ) Seraphim , Cherubim , Thrones ; ( 2 ) Dominations , Virtues , Powers ; ( 3 ) Princedoms , Archangels , and Angels . Cf . Dante 's Paradiso , xxviii , Tasso 's Jerusalem Delivered , xviii , 96 , and Milton 's Paradise Lost , v , 748 .</p>
    <p n="588">375 . HER TACKLES SPENT , her worn-out rigging .</p>
    <p n="589">QUESTIONS AND TOPICS</p>
