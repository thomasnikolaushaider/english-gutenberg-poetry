    <docImprint>EDITOR 'S NOTE . In this edition of Herrick quotation is for the first time facilitated by the poems being numbered according to their order in the original edition . This numbering has rendered it possible to print those Epigrams , which successive editors have joined in deploring , in a detachable Appendix , their place in the original being indicated by the numeration . It remains to be added that the footnotes in this edition are intended to explain , as unobtrusively as possible , difficulties of phrase or allusion which might conceivably hinder the understanding of Herrick 's meaning . In the longer Notes at the end of each volume earlier versions of some important poems are printed from manuscripts at the British Museum , and an endeavour has been made to extend the list of Herrick 's debts to classical sources , and to identify some of his friends who have hitherto escaped research . An editor is always apt to mention his predecessors rather for blame than praise , and I therefore take this opportunity of acknowledging my general indebtedness to the pioneer work of Mr. Hazlitt and Dr. Grosart , upon whose foundations all editors of Herrick must necessarily build .</docImprint>

    <head>PREFACE .</head>
    <p n="1">It is singular that the first great age of English lyric poetry should have been also the one great age of English dramatic poetry : but it is hardly less singular that the lyric school should have advanced as steadily as the dramatic school declined from the promise of its dawn . Born with Marlowe , it rose at once with Shakespeare to heights inaccessible before and since and for ever , to sink through bright gradations of glorious decline to its final and beautiful sunset in Shirley : but the lyrical record that begins with the author of “ Euphues ” and “ Endymion ” grows fuller if not brighter through a whole chain of constellations till it culminates in the crowning star of Herrick . Shakespeare 's last song , the exquisite and magnificent overture to “ The Two Noble Kinsmen , ” is hardly so limpid in its flow , so liquid in its melody , as the two great songs in “ Valentinian ": but Herrick , our last poet of that incomparable age or generation , has matched them again and again . As a creative and inventive singer , he surpasses all his rivals in quantity of good work ; in quality of spontaneous instinct and melodious inspiration he reminds us , by frequent and flawless evidence , who above all others must beyond all doubt have been his first master and his first model in lyric poetry — the author of “ The Passionate Shepherd to his Love ” .</p>
    <p n="2">The last of his line , he is and will probably be always the first in rank and station of English song-writers . We have only to remember how rare it is to find a perfect song , good to read and good to sing , combining the merits of Coleridge and Shelley with the capabilities of Tommy Moore and Haynes Bayly , to appreciate the unique and unapproachable excellence of Herrick . The lyrist who wished to be a butterfly , the lyrist who fled or flew to a lone vale at the hour ( whatever hour it may be ) “ when stars are weeping , ” have left behind them such stuff as may be sung , but certainly cannot be read and endured by any one with an ear for verse . The author of the Ode on France and the author of the Ode to the West Wind have left us hardly more than a song a-piece which has been found fit for setting to music : and , lovely as they are , the fame of their authors does not mainly depend on the song of Glycine or the song of which Leigh Hunt so justly and so critically said that Beaumont and Fletcher never wrote anything of the kind more lovely . Herrick , of course , lives simply by virtue of his songs ; his more ambitious or pretentious lyrics are merely magnified and prolonged and elaborated songs . Elegy or litany , epicede or epithalamium , his work is always a song-writer 's ; nothing more , but nothing less , than the work of the greatest song-writer — as surely as Shakespeare is the greatest dramatist — ever born of English race . The apparent or external variety of his versification is , I should suppose , incomparable ; but by some happy tact or instinct he was too naturally unambitious to attempt , like Jonson , a flight in the wake of Pindar . He knew what he could not do : a rare and invaluable gift . Born a blackbird or a thrush , he did not take himself ( or try ) to be a nightingale .</p>
    <p n="3">It has often been objected that he did mistake himself for a sacred poet : and it cannot be denied that his sacred verse at its worst is as offensive as his secular verse at its worst ; nor can it be denied that no severer sentence of condemnation can be passed upon any poet 's work . But neither Herbert nor Crashaw could have bettered such a divinely beautiful triplet as this :—</p>
    <p n="4">“ We see Him come , and know Him ours , Who with His sunshine and His showers Turns all the patient ground to flowers ” .</p>
    <p n="5">That is worthy of Miss Rossetti herself : and praise of such work can go no higher .</p>
    <p n="6">But even such exquisite touches or tones of colour may be too often repeated in fainter shades or more glaring notes of assiduous and facile reiteration . The sturdy student who tackles his Herrick as a schoolboy is expected to tackle his Horace , in a spirit of pertinacious and stolid straightforwardness , will probably find himself before long so nauseated by the incessant inhalation of spices and flowers , condiments and kisses , that if a musk-rat had run over the page it could hardly be less endurable to the physical than it is to the spiritual stomach . The fantastic and the brutal blemishes which deform and deface the loveliness of his incomparable genius are hardly so damaging to his fame as his general monotony of matter and of manner . It was doubtless in order to relieve this saccharine and “ mellisonant ” monotony that he thought fit to intersperse these interminable droppings of natural or artificial perfume with others of the rankest and most intolerable odour : but a diet of alternate sweetmeats and emetics is for the average of eaters and drinkers no less unpalatable than unwholesome . It is useless and thankless to enlarge on such faults or such defects , as it would be useless and senseless to ignore . But how to enlarge , to expatiate , to insist on the charm of Herrick at his best — a charm so incomparable and so inimitable that even English poetry can boast of nothing quite like it or worthy to be named after it — the most appreciative reader will be the slowest to affirm or imagine that he can conjecture . This , however , he will hardly fail to remark : that Herrick , like most if not all other lyric poets , is not best known by his best work . If we may judge by frequency of quotation or of reference , the ballad of the ride from Ghent to Aix is a far more popular , more generally admired and accredited specimen of Mr. Browning 's work than “ The Last Ride Together ” — and “ The Lost Leader ” than “ The Lost Mistress ” . Yet the superiority of the less-popular poem is in either case beyond all question or comparison : in depth and in glow of spirit and of harmony , in truth and charm of thought and word , undeniable and indescribable . No two men of genius were ever more unlike than the authors of “ Paracelsus ” and “ Hesperides ": and yet it is as true of Herrick as of Browning that his best is not always his best-known work . Everyone knows the song , “ Gather ye rosebuds while ye may ” ; few , I fear , by comparison , know the yet sweeter and better song , “ Ye have been fresh and green ” . The general monotony of style and motive which fatigues and irritates his too-persevering reader is here and there relieved by a change of key which anticipates the note of a later and very different lyric school . The brilliant simplicity and pointed grace of the three stanzas to Œnone ( “ What conscience , say , is it in thee ” ) recall the lyrists of the Restoration in their cleanlier and happier mood . And in the very fine epigram headed by the words “ Devotion makes the Deity ” he has expressed for once a really high and deep thought in words of really noble and severe propriety . His “ Mad Maid 's Song , ” again , can only be compared with Blake 's ; which has more of passionate imagination , if less of pathetic sincerity .</p>

    <head>LIFE OF HERRICK .</head>
    <head>Of the lives of many poets we know too much ; of some few too little . Lovers of Herrick are almost ideally fortunate . Just such a bare outline of his life has come down to us as is sufficient to explain the allusions in his poems , and , on the other hand , there is no temptation to substitute chatter about his relations with Julia and Dianeme for enjoyment of his delightful verse . The recital of the bare outline need detain us but a few minutes : only the least imaginative of readers will have any difficulty in filling it in from the poems themselves .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">From early in the fourteenth century onwards we hear of the family of</l>
     <l n="2">Eyrick or Herrick at Stretton , in Leicestershire . At the beginning of</l>
     <l n="3">the sixteenth century we find a branch of it settled in Leicester</l>
     <l n="4">itself , where John Eyrick , the poet 's grandfather , was admitted a</l>
     <l n="5">freeman in 1535 , and afterwards acted as Mayor . This John 's second son ,</l>
     <l n="6">Nicholas , migrated to London , became a goldsmith in Wood Street ,</l>
     <l n="7">Cheapside , and , according to a licence issued by the Bishop of London ,</l>
     <l n="8">December 8 , 1582 , married Julian , daughter of William Stone , sister of</l>
     <l n="9">Anne , wife of Sir Stephen Soame , Lord Mayor of London in 1598 . The</l>
     <l n="10">marriage was not unfruitful . A William [ A ] Herrick was baptized at St .</l>
     <l n="11">Vedast 's , Foster Lane , November 24 , 1585 ; Martha , January 22 , 1586 ;</l>
     <l n="12">Mercy , December 22 , 1586 ; Thomas , May 7 , 1588 ; Nicholas , April 22 , 1589 ;</l>
     <l n="13">Anne , July 26 , 1590 ; and Robert himself , August 24 , 1591 .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="14">[ A ] A second William is said to have been born , posthumously , in “ Harry</l>
     <l n="15">Campion 's house at Hampton , ” in 1593 .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Fifteen months after the poet 's birth , on November 7 , 1592 , Nicholas Herrick made his will , estimating his property as worth £ 3000 , and devising it , as to one-third to his wife , and as to the other two-thirds to his children in equal shares . In the will he described himself as “ of perfect memorye in sowle , but sicke in bodye ” . Two days after its execution he was buried , having died , not from disease , but from a fall from an upper window . His death had so much the appearance of self-destruction that £ 220 had to be paid to the High Almoner , Dr. Fletcher , Bishop of Bristol , in satisfaction of his official claim to the goods and chattels of suicides . Herrick 's biographers have not failed to vituperate the Bishop for his avarice , but dues allowed by law are hardly to be abandoned because a baby of fifteen months is destined to become a brilliant poet , and no other exceptional circumstances are alleged . The estate of Nicholas Herrick could the better afford the fine inasmuch as it realized £ 2000 more than was expected .</p>
   <p>By the will Robert and William Herrick were appointed “ overseers , ” or trustees for the children . The former was the poet 's godfather , and in his will of 1617 left him £ 5 . To William Herrick , then recently knighted for his services as goldsmith , jeweller , and moneylender to James I ., the young Robert was apprenticed for ten years , September 25 , 1607 . An allusion to “ beloved Westminster , ” in his Tears to Thamesis , has been taken to refer to Westminster school , and alleged as proof that he was educated there . Dr. Grosart even presses the mention of Richmond , Kingston , and Hampton Court to support a conjecture that Herrick may have travelled up and down to school from Hampton . If so , one wonders what his headmaster had to say to the “ soft-smooth virgins , for our chaste disport ” by whom he was accompanied . But the references in the poem are surely to his courtier-life in London , and after his father 's death the apprenticeship to his uncle in 1607 is the first fact in his life of which we can be sure .</p>
   <p>In 1607 , Herrick was fifteen , and , even if we conjecture that he may have been allowed to remain at school some little time after his apprenticeship nominally began , he must have served his uncle for five or six years . Sir William had himself been bound apprentice in a similar way to the poet 's father , and we have no evidence that he exacted any premium . At any rate , when in 1614 , his nephew , then of age , desired to leave the business and go to Cambridge , the ten years ’ apprenticeship did not stand in his way , and he entered as a Fellow Commoner at St. John 's . His uncle plainly still managed his affairs , for an amusing series of fourteen letters has been preserved at Beaumanor , until lately the seat of Sir William 's descendants , in which the poet asks sometimes for payment of a quarterly stipend of £ 10 , sometimes for a formal loan , sometimes for the help of his avuncular Mæcenas . It seems a fair inference from this variety of requests that , since Herrick 's share of his father 's property could hardly have yielded a yearly income of £ 40 , he was allowed to draw on his capital for this sum , but that his uncle and Lady Herrick occasionally made him small presents , which may account for his tone of dependence .</p>
   <p>The quarterly stipend was paid through various booksellers , but irregularly , so that the poor poet was frequently reduced to great straits , though £ 40 a-year (£ 200 of our money ) was no bad allowance . After two years he migrated from St. John 's to Trinity Hall , to study law and curtail his expenses . He took his Bachelor 's degree from there in January , 1617 , and his Master 's in 1620 . The fourteen letters show that he had prepared himself for University life by cultivating a very florid prose style which frequently runs into decasyllabics , perhaps a result of a study of the dramatists . Sir William Herrick is sometimes addressed in them as his most “ careful ” uncle , but at the time of his migration the poet speaks of his “ ebbing estate , ” and as late as 1629 he was still £ 10 16s . 9d . in debt to the College Steward . We can thus hardly imagine that he was possessed of any considerable private income when he returned to London , to live practically on his wits , and a study of his poems suggests that , the influence of the careful uncle removed , whatever capital he possessed was soon likely to vanish . [ B ] His verses to the Earl of Pembroke , to Endymion Porter and to others , show that he was glad of “ pay ” as well as “ praise , ” but the system of patronage brought no discredit with it , and though the absence of any poetical mention of his uncle suggests that the rich goldsmith was not well-pleased with his nephew , with the rest of his well-to-do relations Herrick seems to have remained on excellent terms .</p>
   <p>[ B ] Yet in his Farewell to Poetry he distinctly says :—</p>
   <p>“ I 've more to bear my charge than way to go ” ;</p>
   <p>the line , however , is a translation from his favourite Seneca , Ep . 77 .</p>
   <p>Besides patrons , such as Pembroke , Westmoreland , Newark , Buckingham , Herrick had less distinguished friends at Court , Edward Norgate , Jack Crofts and others . He composed the words for two New Year anthems which were set to music by Henry Lawes , and he was probably personally known both to the King and Queen . Outside the Court he reckoned himself one of Ben Jonson 's disciples , “ Sons of Ben ” as they were called , had friends at the Inns of Court , knew the organist of Westminster Abbey and his pretty daughters , and had every temptation to live an amusing and expensive life . His poems were handed about in manuscript after the fashion of the time , and wherever music and poetry were loved he was sure to be a welcome guest .</p>
   <p>Mr. Hazlitt 's conjecture that Herrick at this time may have held some small post in the Chapel at Whitehall is not unreasonable , but at what date he took Holy Orders is not known . In 1627 he obtained the post of chaplain to the unlucky expedition to the Isle of Rhé , and two years later ( September 30 , 1629 ) he was presented by the King to the Vicarage of Dean Prior , in Devonshire , which the promotion of its previous incumbent , Dr. Potter , to the Bishopric of Carlisle , had left in the royal gift . The annual value of the living was only £ 50 (£ 250 present value ) , no great prize , but the poem entitled Mr. Robert Hericke : his farwell unto Poetrie ( not printed in Hesperides , but extant in more than one manuscript version ) shows that the poet was not unaware of the responsibilities of his profession . “ But unto me , ” he says to his Muse :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ But unto me be only hoarse , since now</l>
     <l n="2">( Heaven and my soul bear record of my vow )</l>
     <l n="3">I my desires screw from thee and direct</l>
     <l n="4">Them and my thoughts to that sublime respect</l>
     <l n="5">And conscience unto priesthood . ‘ Tis not need</l>
     <l n="6">( The scarecrow unto mankind ) that doth breed</l>
     <l n="7">Wiser conclusions in me , since I know</l>
     <l n="8">I 've more to bear my charge than way to go ;</l>
     <l n="9">Or had I not , I 'd stop the spreading itch</l>
     <l n="10">Of craving more : so in conceit be rich ;</l>
     <l n="11">But ‘ tis the God of nature who intends</l>
     <l n="12">And shapes my function for more glorious ends . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Perhaps it was at this time too that Herrick wrote his Farewell to Sack , and although he returned both to sack and to poetry we should be wrong in imagining him as a “ blind mouth , ” using his office merely as a means of gain . He celebrated the births of Charles II and his brother in verse , perhaps with an eye to future royal favours , but no more than Chaucer 's good parson does he seem to have “ run to London unto Seynte Poules ” in search of the seventeenth century equivalent for a chauntry , and many of his poems show him living the life of a contented country clergyman , sharing the contents of bin and cruse with his poor parishioners , and jotting down sermon-notes in verse .</p>
   <p>The great majority of Herrick 's poems cannot be dated , and it is idle to enquire which were written before his ordination and which afterwards . His conception of religion was medieval in its sensuousness , and he probably repeated the stages of sin , repentance and renewed assurance with some facility . He lived with an old servant , Prudence Baldwin , the “ Prew ” of many of his poems ; kept a spaniel named Tracy , and , so says tradition , a tame pig . When his parishioners annoyed him he seems to have comforted himself with epigrams on them ; when they slumbered during one of his sermons the manuscript was suddenly hurled at them with a curse for their inattention .</p>
   <p>In the same year that Herrick was appointed to his country vicarage his mother died while living with her daughter , Mercy , the poet 's dearest sister ( see 818 ) , then for some time married to John Wingfield of Brantham in Suffolk ( see 590 ) , by whom she had three sons and a daughter , also called Mercy . His eldest brother , Thomas , had been placed with a Mr. Massam , a merchant , but as early as 1610 had retired to live a country life in Leicestershire ( see 106 ) . He appears to have married a wife named Elizabeth , whose loss Herrick laments ( see 72 ) . Nicholas , the next brother was more adventurous . He had become a merchant trading to the Levant , and in this capacity had visited the Holy Land ( see 1100 ) . To his wife Susanna , daughter of William Salter , Herrick addresses two poems ( 522 and 977 ) . There were three sons and four daughters in this family , and Herrick wrote a poem to one of the daughters , Bridget ( 562 ) , and an elegy on another , Elizabeth ( 376 ) . When Mrs. Herrick died the bulk of her property was left to the Wingfields , but William Herrick received a legacy of £ 100 , with ten pounds apiece to his two children , and a ring of twenty shillings to his wife . Nicholas and Robert were only left twenty-shilling rings , and the administration of the will was entrusted to William Herrick and the Wingfields . The will may have been the result of a family arrangement , and we have no reason to believe that the unequal division gave rise to any ill-feeling . Herrick 's address to “ his dying brother , Master William Herrick ” ( 186 ) , shows abundant affection , and there is every reason to believe that it was addressed to the William who administered to Mrs. Herrick 's will .</p>
   <p>While little nephews and nieces were springing up around him , Herrick remained unmarried , and frequently congratulates himself on his freedom from the yoke matrimonial . He imagined how he would bid farewell to his wife , if he had one ( 465 ) , and wrote magnificent epithalamia for his friends , but lived and died a bachelor . When first civil troubles and then civil war cast a shadow over the land , it is not very easy to say how he viewed the contending parties . He was devoted to Charles and Henrietta Maria and the young Prince of Wales , and rejoiced at every Royalist success . Many also of his poems breathe the spirit of unquestioning loyalty , but in others he is less certain of kingly wisdom . Something , however , must be allowed for his evident habit of versifying any phrase or epigram which impressed him , and not all his poems need be regarded as expressions of his personal opinions . But with whatever doubts his loyalty was qualified , it was sufficiently obvious to procure his ejection from his living in 1648 ; and , making the best of his loss , he bade farewell to Dean Prior , shook the dust of “ loathed Devonshire ” off his feet , and returned gaily to London , where he appears to have discarded his clerical habit and to have been made abundantly welcome by his friends .</p>
   <p>Free from the cares of his incumbency , and free also from the restraints it imposed , Herrick 's thoughts turned to the publication of his poems . As we have said , in his old Court-days these had found some circulation in manuscript , and in 1635 one of his fairy poems was printed , probably without his leave ( see Appendix ) . In 1639 his poem ( 575 ) The Apparition of his Mistress calling him to Elysium was licensed at Stationers ’ Hall under the title of His Mistress ’ Shade , and it was included the next year in an edition of Shakespeare 's Poems ( see Notes ) . On April 29 , 1640 , “ The severall poems written by Master Robert Herrick , ” were entered as to be published by Andrew Crook , but no trace of such a volume has been discovered , and it was only in 1648 that Hesperides at length appeared . Two years later upwards of eighty of the poems in it were printed in the 1650 edition of Witt 's Recreations , but a small number of these show considerable variations from the Hesperides versions , and it is probable that they were printed from the poet 's manuscript . Compilers of other miscellanies and song books laid Herrick under contribution , but , with the one exception of his contribution to the Lacrymæ Musarum in 1649 , no fresh production of his pen has been preserved , and we know nothing further of his life save that he returned to Dean Prior after the Restoration ( August 24 , 1662 ) , and that according to the parish register “ Robert Herrick , Vicker , was buried y ^ e 15th day October , 1674 . ”</p>

   <p>NOTE TO SECOND EDITION .</p>
   <p>In this edition some trifling errors , which had crept into the text and the numeration of the poems , have been corrected , and many fresh illustrations of Herrick 's reading added in the notes , which have elsewhere been slightly compressed to make room for them . Almost all of the new notes have been supplied from the manuscript collections of a veteran student of Herrick who placed himself in correspondence with me after the publication of my first edition . To my great regret I am not allowed to make my acknowledgments to him by name .</p>

     <l n="3">Could'st leave the city , for exchange , to see</l>
     <l n="4">The country 's sweet simplicity :</l>
     <l n="5">And it to know and practise , with intent</l>
     <l n="6">To grow the sooner innocent</l>
     <l n="7">By studying to know virtue , and to aim</l>
     <l n="8">More at her nature than her name .</l>
     <l n="9">The last is but the least ; the first doth tell</l>

     <l n="11">And both are known to thee , who now can'st live</l>
     <l n="12">Led by thy conscience ; to give</l>

     <l n="14">Wisdom and she together go</l>

     <l n="18">In the contented mind , not mint :</l>
     <l n="19">And can'st instruct that those who have the itch</l>

     <l n="21">These things thou know'st to th ’ height , and dost prevent</l>
     <l n="22">That plague ; because thou art content</l>
     <l n="23">With that heav'n gave thee with a wary hand ,</l>
     <l n="24">More blessed in thy brass than land ,</l>
     <l n="25">To keep cheap nature even and upright ;</l>
     <l n="26">To cool , not cocker appetite .</l>

     <l n="53">With thousand such enchanting dreams , that meet</l>
     <l n="54">To make sleep not so sound as sweet :</l>

     <l n="58">To work , but first to sacrifice ;</l>
     <l n="59">Making thy peace with heav'n , for some late fault ,</l>
     <l n="60">With holy-meal and spirting-salt .</l>
     <l n="61">Which done , thy painful thumb this sentence tells us ,</l>

     <l n="70">Sitt'st , and believ'st that there be seas</l>
     <l n="71">And watery dangers ; while thy whiter hap</l>
     <l n="72">But sees these things within thy map .</l>
     <l n="73">And viewing them with a more safe survey</l>
     <l n="74">Mak'st easy fear unto thee say ,—</l>

     <l n="76">Had , first durst plough the ocean ” .</l>
     <l n="77">But thou at home , without or tide or gale ,</l>

     <l n="85">Fame tell of states , of countries , courts , and kings ,</l>
     <l n="86">And believe there be such things :</l>
     <l n="87">When of these truths thy happier knowledge lies</l>

     <l n="91">Thy pious wishes are , though thou not there ,</l>

     <l n="98">A wise man ev'ry way lies square ,</l>

     <l n="12">Nay , profanation to keep in ,</l>

     <l n="18">For jewels for your gown or hair :</l>
     <l n="19">Fear not ; the leaves will strew</l>
     <l n="20">Gems in abundance upon you :</l>

    <head>182 . THE CAPTIV 'D BEE , OR THE LITTLE FILCHER .</head>
     <l n="1">As Julia once a-slumbering lay</l>
     <l n="2">It chanced a bee did fly that way ,</l>
     <l n="3">After a dew or dew-like shower ,</l>
     <l n="4">To tipple freely in a flower .</l>
     <l n="5">For some rich flower he took the lip</l>

     <l n="8">Honey , and in the quintessence ,</l>
     <l n="9">He drank so much he scarce could stir ,</l>
     <l n="10">So Julia took the pilferer .</l>

     <l n="14">Hither the least one thieving thought ;</l>
     <l n="15">But , taking those rare lips of yours</l>
     <l n="16">For some fresh , fragrant , luscious flowers ,</l>
     <l n="17">I thought I might there take a taste ,</l>
     <l n="18">Where so much syrup ran at waste .</l>
     <l n="19">Besides , know this : I never sting</l>
     <l n="20">The flower that gives me nourishing ;</l>
     <l n="21">But with a kiss , or thanks , do pay</l>
     <l n="22">For honey that I bear away .</l>
     <l n="23">This said , he laid his little scrip</l>
     <l n="24">Of honey ‘ fore her ladyship :</l>
     <l n="25">And told her , as some tears did fall ,</l>
     <l n="26">That that he took , and that was all .</l>
     <l n="27">At which she smiled , and bade him go</l>
     <l n="28">And take his bag ; but thus much know :</l>
     <l n="29">When next he came a-pilfering so ,</l>

     <l n="77">No scurril jest ; no open scene is laid</l>

     <l n="106">When what is strongly built , no chink</l>

   <p>38 . To please those babies in your eyes . The phrase “ babies [ i. e ., dolls ] in the eyes ” is probably only a translation of its metaphor , involved in the use of the Latin pupilla ( a little girl ) , or “ pupil , ” for the central spot of the eye . The metaphor doubtless arose from the small reflections of the inlooker , which appear in the eyes of the person gazed at ; but we meet with it both intensified , as in the phrase “ to look babies in the eyes ” (= to peer amorously ) , and with its origin disregarded , as in Herrick , where the “ babies ” are the pupils , and have an existence independent of any inlooker .</p>

   <p>77 . To the King , upon his coming with his army into the west . Essex had marched into the west in June , 1644 , relieved Lyme , and captured royal fortresses in Dorset and Devon . Charles followed him into “ the drooping west , ” and , in September , the Parliamentary infantry were forced to surrender , while Essex himself escaped by sea . Herrick 's “ white omens ” were thus fulfilled .</p>
   <p>79 . To the King and Queen upon their unhappy distances . Henrietta Maria escaped abroad with the crown jewels in 1642 , returned the next year and rejoined Charles in the west in 1644 , whence she escaped again to France . This poem has been supposed to refer to domestic dissensions ; but the “ ball of strife ” is surely the Civil War in general , and the reference to the parting of 1644 .</p>
   <p>81 . The Cheat of Cupid . Herrick is here translating “ Anacreon , ” 31 [ 3 ]:—</p>
   <p>Μεσονυκτίοις ποθ ’ ὥραις στρέφεθ ’ ἡνίκ ’ Ἄρκτος ἤδη κατὰ χεῖρα τὴν Βοώτου , μερόπων δὲ φῦλα πάντα κέαται κόπῳ δαμέντα , 5 τότ ’ Ἔρως ἐπισταθείς μευ θυρέων ἔκοπτ ’ ὀχῆας . τίς , ἔφην , θύρας ἀράσσει ; κατά μευ σχίζεις ὀνείρους . ὁ δ ’ Ἔρως , ἄνοιγε , φησίν · 10 βρέφος εἰμί , μὴ φόβησαι · βρέχομαι δὲ κἀσέληνον κατὰ νύκτα πεπλάνημαι . ἐλέησα ταῦτ ’ ἀκούσας , ἀνὰ δ ’ εὐθὺ λύχνον ἅψας 15 ἀνέῳξα , καὶ βρέφος μέν ἐσορῶ φἐροντα τόξον πτέρυγάς τε καὶ φαρέτρην . παρὰ δ ’ ἱστίην καθῖσα , παλάμαις τε χεῖρας αὐτοῦ 20 ἀνέθαλπον , ἐκ δὲ χαίτης ἀπέθλιβον ὑγρὸν ὕδωρ . ὁ δ ’ , ἐπεὶ κρύος μεθῆκεν , φέρε , φησί , πειράσωμεν τόδε τόξον , εἴ τι μοι νῦν 25 βλάβεται βραχεῖσα νευρή . τανύει δὲ καί με τύπτει μέσον ἡπαρ , ὥσπερ οἶστρος · ἀνὰ δ ’ ἅλλεται καχάζων , ξένε δ ’ , εἶπε , συγχάρηθι · 30 κέρας ἀβλαβὲς μὲν ἡμῖν , σὺ δὲ καρδίην πονήσεις .</p>
   <p>Some of his phrases , however , prove that he was occasionally more indebted to the Latin version of Stephanus than to the original .</p>
   <p>82 . That for seven lusters I did never come . The fall of Herrick 's father from a window , fifteen months after the poet 's birth , was imputed at the time to suicide ; and it has been reasonably conjectured that some mystery may have attached to the place of his burial . If “ seven lusters ” can be taken literally for thirty-five years , this poem was written in 1627 .</p>
   <p>83 . Delight in Disorder . Cp . Ben Jonson 's “ Still to be neat , still to be drest , ” in its turn imitated from one of the Basia of Johannes Bonefonius .</p>
   <p>85 . Upon Love . Printed in Witts Recreations , 1654 . The only variant is “ To tell me ” for “ To signifie ” in the third line .</p>
   <p>86 . To Dean Bourn . “ We found many persons in the village who could repeat some of his lines , and none who were not acquainted with his ‘ Farewell to Dean Bourn , ’ which they said he uttered as he crossed the brook upon being ejected by Cromwell from the vicarage , to which he had been presented by Charles the First . But they added , with an air of innocent triumph , ‘ he did see it again , ’ as was the fact after the restoration . ” Barron Field in Quarterly Review , August , 1810 . Herrick was ejected in 1648 .</p>

   <p>106 . A Country Life : To his brother , M. Tho . Herrick . “ Thomas , baptized May 12 , 1588 , was placed by his uncle and guardian , Sir William Heyrick , with Mr. Massam , a merchant in London ; but in 1610 he appears to have returned into the country and to have settled in a small farm . It is supposed that this Thomas was the father of Thomas Heyrick , who in 1668 resided at Market Harborough and issued a trader 's token there , and grandfather to the Thomas who was curate of Harborough and published some sermons and poems . ” Hill 's Market Harborough , p. 122 .</p>
   <p>A MS. version of this poem is contained in Ashmole 38 , from which Dr. Grosart gives a full collation on pp . cli. - cliii . of his Memorial Introduction .

   <p>112 . To the Earl of Westmoreland . Mildmay Fane succeeded his father , Thomas Fane , the first earl , in March , 1628 . At the outbreak of the Civil War he sided with the king , but after a short imprisonment made his submission to the Parliament , and was relieved of the sequestration of his estates . He subsequently printed privately a volume of poems , called Otia Sacra , which has been re-edited by Dr. Grosart .</p>
   <p>117 . To the Patron of Poets , M. End . Porter . Five of Herrick 's poems are addressed to Endymion Porter , who seems to have been looked to as a patron by all the singers of his day . According to the inscription on a medal of him executed by Varin in 1635 , he was then forty-eight , so that he was born in 1587 , coming into the world at Aston-under-Hill in Gloucestershire . He went with Charles on his trip to Spain , and after his accession became groom of his bedchamber , was active in the king 's service during the Civil War , and died in 1649 . He was a collector of works of art both for himself and for the king , and encouraged Rob . Dover 's Cotswold games by presenting him with a suit of the king 's clothes . À Wood tells us this , and mentions also that he was a friend of Donne , that Gervase Warmsely dedicated his Virescit Vulnere Virtus to him in 1628 , and that in conjunction with the Earl of St. Alban 's he also received the dedication of Davenant 's Madagascar .</p>

Dr. Grosart quotes an “ Epitaph upon his honoured friend , Master Warre , ” by Randolph . Nothing is known of him , but I find in the Oxford Register that a John Warr matriculated at Exeter College , 16th May , 1619 , and proceeded M. A . in 1624 .

John Williams ( 1582-1650 ) , Bishop of Lincoln , 1621 ; Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal , 1621-1625 ; suspended and imprisoned , 1637-1640 , on a frivolous charge of having betrayed the king 's secrets ; Archbishop of York , 1641 . Save from this poem and the Carol printed in the Appendix we know nothing of his relations with Herrick . He had probably stood in the way of the poet 's obtaining holy orders or preferment . When Herrick was appointed to the cure of Dean Prior in 1629 , Williams had already lost favour at the Court .</p>

   <p>178 . Corinna 's going a-Maying . Herrick 's poem is a charming expansion of Chaucer 's theme : “ For May wol have no slogardye a night ” . The account of May-day customs in Brand ( vol . i. pp . 212-234 ) is unusually full , and all Herrick 's allusions can be illustrated from it . Dr. Nott compares the last stanza to Catullus , Carm . v .; but parallels from the classic poets could be multiplied indefinitely .</p>

   <p>185 . An Ode to Master Endymion Porter , upon his brother 's death . Endymion Porter is said to have had an only brother , Giles , who died in the king 's service at Oxford , i. e ., between 1642 and 1646 , and it has been taken for granted that this ode refers to his death . The supposition is possibly right , but if so , the ode , despite its beauty , is so gratingly and extraordinarily selfish that we may wonder if the dead brother is not the William Herrick of the next poem . The first verse is , of course , a soliloquy of Herrick 's , not , as Dr. Grosart suggests , addressed to him by Porter . Dr. Nott again parallels Catullus , Carm . v .</p>
   <p>186 . To his dying brother , Master William Herrick . According to Dr. Grosart and Mr. Hazlitt the poet had an elder brother , William , baptized at St. Vedast 's , Foster Lane , Nov. 24 , 1585 ( he must have been born some months earlier , if this date be right , for his sister Martha was baptized in the following January ) , and alive in 1629 , when he acted as one of the executors of his mother 's will . But , it is said , there was also another brother named William , born in 1593 , after his father 's death , “ at Harry Campion 's house at Hampton ” . I have not been able to find the authority for this last statement , which , as it asserts the co-existence of two brothers , of the same name , is certainly surprising . According to Dr. Grosart , it is the younger William who “ died young ” and was addressed in this poem , but I must own to feeling some doubt in the matter .</p>

   <p>197 . The Welcome to Sack . Two MSS . at the British Museum ( Harl . 6931 and Add . 19 , 268 ) contain copies of this important poem . These copies differ considerably from the printed version , are proved by small variations to be independent of each other , and at the same time agree in all important points . We may conclude , therefore , that they represent an earlier version of the poem , subsequently revised by Herrick before the issue of Hesperides . In the subjoined copy , in which the two MSS . are corrected from each other , italics show the variations , asterisks mark lines omitted in Hesperides , and a dagger the absence of lines subsequently added .</p>

   <p>213 . And all most sweet , yet all less sweet than he . It is characteristic of Herrick that in his Noble Numbers ( “ The New-Year 's Gift ” ) he repeats this line , applying it to Christ .</p>

   <p>Clarendon ( History of the Rebellion , ix . 19 ) thus records his death and character : “ Here fell many gentlemen and officers of name , with the brave Earl of Litchfield , who was the third brother of that illustrious family that sacrificed his life in this quarrel . He was a very faultless young man , of a most gentle , courteous , and affable nature , and of a spirit and courage invincible ; whose loss all men lamented , and the king bore it with extraordinary grief . ”</p>
   <p>Trentall . Properly a set of thirty masses for the repose of a dead man 's soul . Here and elsewhere Herrick uses the word as an equivalent for dirge , but Sidney distinguished them : “ Let dirige be sung and trentalls rightly read . For love is dead , ” etc . “ Hence , hence profane , ” is the Latin , procul o procul este profani of Virg . Æn . vi . 258 , where “ profane ” is only equivalent to uninitiated .</p>

     <l n="2">Appendix . On the dedication to Mr. John Merrifield , Counsellor-at-Law ,</l>
     <l n="3">Dr. Grosart remarks : “ Nothing seems to be now known of Merrifield . It is</l>
     <l n="4">just possible that — as throughout the poem — the name was an invented</l>
     <l n="5">one , ‘ Merry Field ’ . ” But the records of the Inner Temple show that the</l>
     <l n="6">Merrifields were a legal family from Woolmiston , near Crewkerne ,</l>
     <l n="7">Somersetshire . John ( son of Richard ) Merrifield , the father , was</l>
     <l n="8">admitted to the Inner Temple in 1581 , and John , the son , in 1611 . This</l>
     <l n="9">latter must be Herrick 's Counsellor . He rose to be a Master of the Bench</l>
     <l n="10">in 1638 and Sergeant-at-Law in 1660 . He died October , 1666 , aged 75 , at</l>
     <l n="11">Crewkerne . On the other hand , it can hardly be doubted that Dr. Grosart</l>
     <l n="12">is right in regarding the names of the fairy saints as quite imaginary .</l>
     <l n="13">He nevertheless suggests SS . Titus , Neot , Idus , Ida , Fridian or</l>

Of this Epithalamium ( written in 1625 for the marriage of Sir Clipseby Crew , knighted by James I. at Theobald 's in 1620 , with Jane , daughter of Sir John Pulteney ) , two manuscript versions , substantially agreeing , are preserved at the British Museum ( Harl . MS. 6917 , and Add . 25 , 303 ) . Seven verses are transcribed in these manuscripts which Herrick afterwards saw fit to omit , and almost every verse contains variants of importance . It is impossible to convey the effect of the earlier version by a mere collation , and I therefore transcribe it in full , despite its length . As before , variants and additions are printed in italics . The numbers in brackets are those of the later version , as given in Hesperides . The marginal readings are variants of Add . 25 , 303 , from the Harleian manuscript .</p>

    <head>— R. HERRICK .</head>
    <head>The variants in this version are not very important ; one of the most noteworthy , round for ground , in stanza 5<span type="note_anchor">[ 4 ]</span>, was overlooked by Dr. Grosart in his collation . Of the seven stanzas subsequently omitted several are of great beauty . There are few happier images in Herrick than that of Time throned in a saffron evening in stanza 11 . It is only when the earlier version is read as a whole that Herrick 's taste in omitting is vindicated . Each stanza is good in itself , but in the MSS . the poem drags from excessive length , and the reduction of its twenty-three stanzas to sixteen greatly improves it .</head>

   <p>The Shapcott to whom this Oberon 's Feast and Oberon 's Palace are dedicated is Herrick 's “ peculiar friend , Master Thomas Shapcott , Lawyer , ” of a later poem . Dr. Grosart again suggests that it may have been a character-name , but , as in the case of John Merrifield , the owner was a West country-man and a member of the Inner Temple , where he was admitted in 1632 as the “ son and heir of Thomas Shapcott , ” of Exeter .</p>

     <l n="3">301 . Master Edward Norgate , Clerk of the Signet of his Majesty :—</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Son to Robert Norgate , D. D ., Master of Bene't College , Cambridge . He was employed by the Earl of Arundel to purchase pictures , and on one occasion found himself at Marseilles without remittances , and had to tramp through France on foot . According to the Calendars of State Papers in 1625 , it was ordered that , “ forasmuch as his Majesty 's letters to the Grand Signior , the King of Persia , the Emperor of Russia , the Great Mogul , and other remote Princes , had been written , limned , and garnished with gold and colours by scriveners abroad , thenceforth they should be so written , limned , and garnished by Edward Norgate , Clerk of the Signet in reversion ” . Six years later this order was renewed , the “ Kings of Bantam , Macassar , Barbary , Siam , Achine , Fez , and Sus ” being added to the previous list , and Norgate being now designated as a Clerk of the Signet Extraordinary . In the same year , having previously been Bluemantle Pursuivant , he was promoted to be Windsor Herald , in which capacity he received numerous fees during the next few years , and was excused ship money . He still , however , retained his clerkship , for he writes in 1639 : “ The poor Office of Arms is fain to blazon the Council books and Signet ” . The phrase occurs in a series of nineteen letters of extraordinary interest , which Norgate wrote from the North , chiefly to his friend , Robert Reade , secretary to Windebank , on the course of affairs . In Sept ., 1641 , “ Ned Norgate ” was ordered personally to attend the king . “ It is his Majesty 's pleasure that the master should wait and not the men , and that they shall find . ” Henceforth I find no certain reference to him ; according to Fuller he died at the Herald 's Office in 1649 . It would be interesting if we could be sure that this Edward Norgate is the same as the one who in 1611 was appointed Tuner of his Majesty 's “ virginals , organs , and other instruments , ” and in 1637 received a grant of £ 140 for the repair of the organ at Hampton Court . Herrick 's love of music makes us expect to find a similar trait in his friends .</p>
   <p>313 . The Entertainment , or Porch Verse . The words Ye wrong the threshold-god and the allusion to the porch in the Clipsby Crew Epithalamium ( stanza 4 ) show that there is no reference here ( as Brand thinks , ii . 135 ) to the old custom of reading part of the marriage service at the church door or porch ( cp . Chaucer : “ Husbands at churchë door she had had five ” ) . The porch of the house is meant , and the allusions are to the ceremonies at the threshold ( cp . the Southwell Epithalamium ) . Dr. Grosart quotes from the Dean Prior register the entry of the marriage of Henry Northleigh , gentleman , and Mistress Lettice Yard on September 5 , 1639 , by licence from the Archbishop of Canterbury .</p>
   <p>319 . No noise of late-spawned Tittyries . In the Camden Society 's edition of the Diary of Walter Yonge , p. 70 ( kindly shown me by the Rev . J. H. Ward ) , we have a contemporary account of the Club known as the Tityre Tues , which took its name from the first words of Virgil 's first Eclogue . “ The beginning of December , 1623 , there was a great number in London , haunting taverns and other debauched places , who swore themselves in a brotherhood and named themselves Tityre Tues . The oath they gave in this manner : he that was to be sworn did put his dagger into a pottle of wine , and held his hand upon the pommel thereof , and then was to make oath that he would aid and assist all other of his fellowship and not disclose their council . There were divers knights , some young noblemen and gentlemen of this brotherhood , and they were to know one the other by a black bugle which they wore , and their followers to be known by a blue ribbond . There are discovered of them about 80 or 100 persons , and have been examined by the Privy Council , but nothing discovered of any intent they had . It is said that the king hath given commandment that they shall be re-examined . ” In Mennis 's Musarum Deliciæ the brotherhood is celebrated in a poem headed “ The Tytre Tues ; or , a Mocke Song . To the tune of Chive Chase . By Mr. George Chambers . ” The second verse runs :—</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ They call themselves the Tytere-tues ,</l>
     <l n="2">And wore a blue rib-bin ;</l>
     <l n="3">And when a-drie would not refuse</l>
     <l n="4">To drink . O fearful sin !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">“ The council , which is thought most wise ,</l>
     <l n="6">Did sit so long upon it ,</l>
     <l n="7">That they grew weary and did rise ,</l>
     <l n="8">And could make nothing on it . ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>According to a letter of Chamberlain to Carleton , indexed among the State Papers , the Tityres were a secret society first formed in Lord Vaux 's regiment in the Low Countries , and their “ prince ” was called Ottoman . Another entry shows that the “ Bugle ” mentioned by Yonge was the badge of a society originally distinct from the Tityres , which afterwards joined with it . The date of Herrick 's poem is thus fixed as December , 1623 / 4 , and this is confirmed by another sentence in the same passage in Yonge 's Diary , in which he says : “ The Jesuits and Papists do wonderfully swarm in the city , and rumours lately have been given out for firing the Navy and House of Munition , on which are set a double guard ” . The Parliament to which Herrick alludes was actually summoned in January , 1624 , to meet on February 12 . Sir Simeon Steward , to whom the poem is addressed , was of the family of the Stewards of Stantney , in the Isle of Ely . He was knighted with his father , Mark Steward , in 1603 , and afterwards became a fellow-commoner of Trinity Hall , Cambridge . He was at different times Sheriff and Deputy-Lieutenant for Cambridgeshire , and while serving in the latter capacity got into some trouble for unlawful exactions . In 1627 he wrote a poem on the King of the Fairies Clothes in the same vein as Herrick 's fairy pieces .</p>
   <p>321 . Then is the work half done . As Dr. Grosart suggests , Herrick may have had in mind the “ Dimidium facti qui cœpit habet ” of Horace , I. Epist . ii . 40 . But here the emphasis is on beginning well , there on beginning .</p>

   <p>336 . His Age : dedicated to ... M. John Wickes under the name of Posthumus . There is an important version of this poem in Egerton MS ., 2725 , where it is entitled Mr. Herrick 's Old Age to Mr. Weekes . I do not think it has been collated before . Stanzas i. - vi . contain few variants ; ii . 6 reads : “ Dislikes to care for what 's behind ” ; iii . 6 : “ Like a lost maidenhead , ” for “ Like to a lily lost ” ; v. 8 : “ With the best and whitest stone ” ; vi . 1 : “ We 'll not be poor ” . After this we have two stanzas omitted in 1648 :—</p>

Stanzas x. - xvii . have so many variants that I am obliged to transcribe them in full , though they show Herrick not at his best , and the poem is not one to linger over :—</p>

   <p>This John Wickes or Weekes is spoken of by Anthony à Wood as a “ jocular person ” and a popular preacher . He enters Wood 's Fasti by right of his co-optation as a D. D . in 1643 , while the court was at Oxford ; his education had been at Cambridge . He was a prebendary of Bristol and Dean of St. Burian in Cornwall , and suffered some persecution as a royalist . Herrick later on , when himself shedless and cottageless , addresses another poem to him as his “ peculiar friend , ”</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">To whose glad threshold and free door</l>
     <l n="2">I may , a poet , come , though poor .</l>

   <p>A friend suggests that Hind may have been John Hind , an Anacreontic poet and friend of Greene , and has found references to a Thomas Goodricke of St. John 's Coll ., Camb ., author of two poems on the accession of James I ., and a Martin Nansogge , B. A . of Trinity Hall , 1614 , afterwards vicar of Cornwood , Devon . Smith is certainly James Smith , who , with Sir John Mennis , edited the Musarum Deliciæ , in which the first poem is addressed “ to Parson Weekes : an invitation to London , ” and contains a reference to —</p>

   </lg>
   <p>The early part of this poem contains , along with the name Posthumus , many Horatian reminiscences : cp . especially II . Od . xiv . 1-8 , and IV . Od . vii . 14 . It may be noted that in the imitation of the latter passage in stanza iv . the MS. copy at the Museum corrects the misplacement of the epithet , reading :—</p>

   <p>Again the variant , “ Open candle baudery , ” in verse 7 , is an additional argument against Dr. Grosart 's explanation : “ Obscene words and figures made with candle-smoke , ” the allusion being merely to the blackened ceilings produced by cheap candles without a shade .</p>

   <p>359 . Philip , Earl of Pembroke and Montgomery . Philip Herbert ( born 1584 , died 1650 ) , despite his foul mouth , ill temper , and devotion to sport ( “ He would make an excellent chancellor to the mews were Oxford turned into a kennel of hounds , ” wrote the author of Mercurius Menippeus when Pembroke succeeded Laud as chancellor ) , was also a patron of literature . He was one of the “ incomparable pair of brethren ” to whom the Shakespeare folio of 1623 was dedicated , and he was a good friend to Massinger . His fondness for scribbling in the margins of books may , or may not , be considered as further evidence of a respect for literature .</p>

   <p>But great and large she spreads by dust and sweat . Dr. Grosart very appositely quotes Montaigne : “ For it seemeth that the verie name of vertue presupposeth difficultie and inferreth resistance , and cannot well exercise it selfe without an enemie ” ( Florio 's tr ., p. 233 ) . But I think the two passages have a common origin in some version of Hesiod 's τῆς ἀρετῆς ἱδρῶτα θεοὶ προπάροιθεν ἔθηκαν , which is twice quoted by Plato .</p>

   <p>The farting Tanner and familiar King . The ballad here alluded to is that of King Edward IV . and the tanner of Tamworth , printed in Prof. Child 's collection . “ The dancing friar tattered in the bush ” of the next line is one of the heroes of the old ballad of The Fryar and the Boye , printed by Wynkyn de Worde , and included in the Appendix to Furnivall and Hales ’ edition of the Percy folio . The boy was the possessor of a “ magic flute , ” and , having got the friar into a bush , made him dance there .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Jack , as he piped , laughed among ,</l>

   </lg>
   <p>“ Those monstrous lies of little Robin Rush ” is explained by Dr. Grosart as an allusion to “ The Historie of Friar Rush , how he came to a House of Religion to seek a Service , and being entertained by the Prior was made First Cook , being full of pleasant Mirth and Delight for young people ” . Of “ Tom Chipperfield and pretty lisping Ned ” I can find nothing . “ The flying Pilchard and the frisking Dace ” probably belong to the fish monsters alluded to in the Tempest . In “ Tim Trundell ” Herrick seems for the sake of alliteration to have taken a liberty with the Christian name of a well-known ballad publisher .</p>

Of the Palace there are as many as three MS. versions , viz ., Add . 22 , 603 ( p. 59 ) , and Add . 25 , 303 ( p. 157 ) , at the British Museum , both of which I have collated , and Ashmole MS. 38 , which I only know through my predecessors . The three MSS . appear to agree very harmoniously , and they unite in increasing our knowledge of Herrick by a passage of twenty-seven lines , following on the words “ And here and there and farther off , ” and in lieu of the next four and a half lines in Hesperides . They read as follows :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Some sort of pear ,</l>
     <l n="2">Apple or plum , is neatly laid</l>
     <l n="3">( As if it was a tribute paid )</l>

     <l n="7">Chippings , the mice filched from the bin</l>
     <l n="8">Of the gray farmer , and to these</l>
     <l n="9">The scraps of lentils , chitted peas ,</l>
     <l n="10">Dried honeycombs , brown acorn cups ,</l>
     <l n="11">Out of the which he sometimes sups</l>
     <l n="12">His herby broth , and there close by</l>
     <l n="13">Are pucker 'd bullace , cankers (? ) , dry</l>
     <l n="14">Kernels , and withered haws ; the rest</l>
     <l n="15">Are trinkets fal'n from the kite 's nest ,</l>
     <l n="16">As butter 'd bread , the which the wild</l>

     <l n="20">Ribbons and then some silken shreaks</l>
     <l n="21">The virgins lost at barley-breaks .</l>
     <l n="22">Many a purse-string , many a thread</l>
     <l n="23">Of gold and silver therein spread ,</l>
     <l n="24">Many a counter , many a die ,</l>

     <l n="35">That shines , ” etc .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The italicised words in the last few lines appear in Hesperides ; all the rest are new . Other variants are : “ The grass of Lemster ore soberly sparkling ” for “ the finest Lemster ore mildly disparkling ” ; “ girdle ” for “ ceston ” ; “ The eyes of all doth strait bewitch ” for “ All with temptation doth bewitch ” ; “ choicely hung ” for “ neatly hung ” ; “ silver roach ” for “ silvery fish ” ; “ cave ” for “ room ” ; “ get reflection ” for “ make reflected ” ; “ Candlemas ” for “ taper-light ” ; “ moon-tane ” for “ moon-tanned , ” etc ., etc .</p>

   <p>451 . To the right gracious Prince , Lodowick , Duke of Richmond and Lennox . There appears to me to be a blunder here which Dr. Grosart and Mr. Hazlitt do not elucidate , by recording the birth of Lodowick , first Duke of Richmond , in 1574 , his succession to the Lennox title in 1583 , creation as Duke of Richmond in May , 1623 , and death in the following February . For this first duke was no “ stem ” left “ of all those three brave brothers fallen in the war , ” and the allusion here is undoubtedly to his nephews — George , Lord d'Aubigny , who fell at Edgehill ; Lord John Stewart , who fell at Alresford ; and Lord Bernard Stewart ( Earl of Lichfield ) , who fell at Rowton Heath . In elucidation of Herrick 's Dirge ( 219 ) over the last of these three brothers , I have already quoted Clarendon 's remark , that he was “ the third brother of that illustrious family that sacrificed his life in this quarrel , ” and it cannot be doubted that Herrick is here alluding to the same fact . The poem must therefore have been written after 1645 , i. e ., more than twenty years after the death of Duke Lodowick . But the duke then living was James , who succeeded his father Esme in 1624 , was recreated Duke of Richmond in 1641 , and did not die till 1655 . It is true that there was a brother named Lodovic , but he was an abbot in France and never succeeded to the title . Herrick , therefore , seems to have blundered in the Christian name .</p>

   <p>465 . The parting Verse or charge to his Supposed Wife when he travelled . MS. variants of this poem are found at the British Museum in Add . 22 , 603 , and in Ashmole MS. 38 . Their title , “ Mr. Herrick 's charge to his wife , ” led Mr. Payne Collier to rashly identify with the poet a certain Robert Herrick married at St. Clement Danes , 1632 , to a Jane Gibbons . The variants are numerous , but not very important . In l. 4 we have “ draw wooers ” for “ draw thousands ” ; ll . 11-16 are transposed to after l. 28 ; and “ Are the expressions of that itch ” is written “ As emblems will express that itch ” ; ll . 27 , 28 appear as :—</p>

     <l n="11">“ Let them call thee wondrous fair ,</l>
     <l n="12">Crown of women , yet despair ” .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Eight lines lower “ virtuous ” is read for “ gentle , ” and the omission of some small words throws some light on a change in Herrick 's metrical views as he grew older . The words omitted are bracketed :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ [ And ] Let thy dreams be only fed</l>
     <l n="2">With this , that I am in thy bed .</l>
     <l n="3">And [ thou ] then turning in that sphere ,</l>
     <l n="4">Waking findst [ shall find ] me sleeping there .</l>

     <l n="6">Thy fortress and must needs prevail</l>
     <l n="7">‘ Gainst thee and force a passage in , ” etc .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Other variants are : “ Creates the action ” for “ That makes the action ” ; “ Glory ” for “ Triumph ” ; “ my last signet ” for “ this compression ” ; “ turn again in my full triumph ” for “ come again , As one triumphant , ” and “ the height of womankind ” for “ all faith of womankind ” .</p>

   <p>470 . Few Fortunate . A variant on the text ( Matt . xx . 16 ): “ Many be called but few chosen ” .</p>
   <p>479 . To Rosemary and Bays . The use of rosemary and bays at weddings forms a section in Brand 's chapter on marriage customs ( ii . 119 ) . For the gilding he quotes from a wedding sermon preached in 1607 by Roger Hacket : “ Smell sweet , O ye flowers , in your native sweetness : be not gilded with the idle art of man ” . The use of gloves at weddings forms the subject of another section in Brand ( ii . 125 ) . He quotes Ben Jonson 's Silent Woman ; “ We see no ensigns of a wedding here , no character of a bridal ; where be our scarves and our gloves ? ”</p>

   <p>496 . To his honoured kinsman , Sir Richard Stone , son of John Stone , sergeant-at-law , the brother of Julian Stone , Herrick 's mother . He died in 1660 .</p>
   <p>To this white temple of my heroes . Ben Jonson 's admirers were proud to call themselves “ sealed of the tribe of Ben , ” and Herrick , a devout Jonsonite , seems to have imitated the idea so far as to plan sometimes , as here , a Temple , sometimes a Book ( see infra , 510 ) , sometimes a City ( 365 ) , a Plantation ( 392 ) , a Calendar ( 545 ) , a College ( 983 ) , of his own favourite friends , to whom his poetry was to give immortality . The earliest direct reference to this plan is in his address to John Selden , the antiquary ( 365 ) , in which he writes :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ A city here of heroes I have made</l>
     <l n="2">Upon the rock whose firm foundation laid</l>
     <l n="3">Shall never shrink ; where , making thine abode ,</l>
     <l n="4">Live thou a Selden , that 's a demi-god ” .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>It is noteworthy that the poems which contain the clearest reference to this Temple ( or its variants ) are mostly addressed to kinsfolk , e. g ., this to Sir Richard Stone , to Mrs. Penelope Wheeler , to Mr. Stephen Soame , and to Susanna and Thomas Herrick . Other recipients of the honour are Sir Edward Fish and Dr. Alabaster , Jack Crofts , Master J. Jincks , etc .</p>

   <p>500 . To Mistress Dorothy Parsons . This “ saint ” from Herrick 's Temple may certainly be identified with the second of the three children ( William , Dorothy , and Thomasine ) of Mr. John Parsons , organist and master of the choristers at Westminster Abbey , where he was buried in 1623 . Herrick addresses another poem to her sister Thomasine :—</p>
   <lg>

     <l n="5">Her forehead smooth , full , polish 'd , bright and high</l>
     <l n="6">Bears in itself a graceful majesty ,</l>
     <l n="7">Under the which two crawling eyebrows twine</l>
     <l n="8">Like to the tendrils of a flatt'ring vine ,</l>
     <l n="9">Under whose shade two starry sparkling eyes</l>

     <l n="28">Smells like the burn 'd Sabean frankincense :</l>
     <l n="29">In which the tongue , though but a member small ,</l>

     <l n="43">But the foundation of the architect</l>

     <l n="45">Which with ambitious humbleness stands under ,</l>
     <l n="46">Bearing aloft this rich , round world of wonder .</l>
     <l n="47">Her breast , a place for beauty 's throne most fit ,</l>
     <l n="48">Bears up two globes where love and pleasure sit ,</l>
     <l n="49">Which , headed with two rich , round rubies , show</l>
     <l n="50">Like wanton rosebuds growing out of snow ;</l>
     <l n="51">And in the milky valley that 's between</l>

     <l n="57">Where Nature , in a whiteness without spot ,</l>
     <l n="58">Hath in the middle tied a Gordian knot .</l>
     <l n="59">Now love invites me to survey her thighs ,</l>
     <l n="60">Swelling in likeness like two crystal skies ,</l>
     <l n="61">Which to the knees by Nature fastened on ,</l>
     <l n="62">Derive their ever well ‘ greed motion .</l>
     <l n="63">Her legs with two clear calves , like silver tri 'd ,</l>
     <l n="64">Kindly swell up with little pretty pride ,</l>
     <l n="65">Leaving a distance for the comely [ E ] small</l>
     <l n="66">To beautify the leg and foot withal .</l>
     <l n="67">Then lowly , yet most lovely stand the feet ,</l>
     <l n="68">Round , short and clear , like pounded spices sweet ,</l>
     <l n="69">And whatsoever thing they tread upon</l>
     <l n="70">They make it scent like bruised cinnamon .</l>
     <l n="71">The lovely shoulders now allure the eye</l>
     <l n="72">To see two tablets of pure ivory</l>
     <l n="73">From which two arms like branches seem to spread</l>
     <l n="74">With tender rind [ F ] and silver coloured ,</l>
     <l n="75">With little hands and fingers long and small</l>

     <l n="77">In length each finger doth his next excel ,</l>
     <l n="78">Each richly headed with a pearly shell .</l>

     <l n="9">Or antique pledges , house or land ,</l>
     <l n="10">I give thee this that shall withstand</l>
     <l n="11">The blow of ruin and of chance .</l>
     <l n="12">These hurt not thine inheritance ,</l>
     <l n="13">For ‘ tis fee simple and no rent</l>

     <l n="17">Cannot deliver up to th ’ rust ,</l>
     <l n="18">Yet I keep peaceful in my dust .</l>
     <l n="19">As for thy birth and better seeds</l>
     <l n="20">( Those which must grow to virtuous deeds ) ,</l>
     <l n="21">Thou didst derive from that old stem</l>
     <l n="22">( Love and mercy cherish them ) ,</l>
     <l n="23">Which like a vestal virgin ply</l>
     <l n="24">With holy fire lest that it die .</l>
     <l n="25">Grow up with milder laws to know</l>
     <l n="26">At what time to say aye or no ;</l>
     <l n="27">Let manners teach thee where to be</l>
     <l n="28">More comely flowing , where less free .</l>

     <l n="34">The maiden candour of thy mind ;</l>
     <l n="35">And under it two chaste-born spies</l>

     <l n="37">For through these optics fly the darts</l>
     <l n="38">Of lust which set on fire our hearts .</l>
     <l n="39">On either side of these quick ears</l>
     <l n="40">There must be plac 'd , for seasoned fears</l>
     <l n="41">Which sweeten love , yet ne'er come nigh</l>
     <l n="42">The plague of wilder jealousy .</l>
     <l n="43">Then let each cheek of thine entice</l>
     <l n="44">His soul as to a bed of spice</l>
     <l n="45">Where he may roll and lose his sense ,</l>
     <l n="46">As in a bed of frankincense .</l>
     <l n="47">A lip enkindled with that coal</l>
     <l n="48">With which love chafes and warms the soul ,</l>
     <l n="49">Bring to him next , and in it show</l>
     <l n="50">Love 's cherries from such fires grow</l>
     <l n="51">And have their harvest , which must stand</l>
     <l n="52">The gathering of the lip , not hand ;</l>
     <l n="53">Then unto these be it thy care</l>
     <l n="54">To clothe thy words in gentle air ,</l>

     <l n="56">As is the childish bloom of bean ,</l>
     <l n="57">They may fall down and stroke , as the</l>

     <l n="62">Or with thy wrist , or flattering hair ,</l>
     <l n="63">He may , a prisoner , there descry</l>
     <l n="64">Bondage more loved than liberty .</l>
     <l n="65">A nature so well formed , so wrought</l>
     <l n="66">To calm and tempest , let be brought</l>
     <l n="67">With thee , that should he but incline</l>
     <l n="68">To roughness , clasp him like a vine ,</l>
     <l n="69">Or like as wool meets steel , give way</l>
     <l n="70">Unto the passion , not to stay ;</l>
     <l n="71">Wrath , if resisted , over-boils ,</l>
     <l n="72">If not , it dies or else recoils .</l>
     <l n="73">And lastly , see you bring to him</l>
     <l n="74">Somewhat peculiar to each limb ;</l>
     <l n="75">And I charge thee to be known</l>
     <l n="76">By n'other face but by thine own .</l>
     <l n="77">Let it in love 's name be kept sleek ,</l>
     <l n="78">Yet to be found when he shall seek</l>
     <l n="79">It , and not instead of saint</l>
     <l n="80">Give up his worth unto the paint ;</l>
     <l n="81">For , trust me , girl , she over-does</l>
     <l n="82">Who by a double proxy woos .</l>
     <l n="83">But lest I should forget his bed ,</l>
     <l n="84">Be sure thou bring a maidenhead .</l>
     <l n="85">That is a margarite , which lost ,</l>
     <l n="86">Thou bring'st unto his bed a frost</l>
     <l n="87">Or a cold poison , which his blood</l>
     <l n="88">Benumbs like the forgetful flood .</l>
     <l n="89">Now for some jewels to supply</l>
     <l n="90">The want of earrings ’ bravery</l>
     <l n="91">For public eyes ; take only these</l>
     <l n="92">Ne'er travelled for beyond the seas ;</l>
     <l n="93">They 're nobly home-bred , yet have price</l>
     <l n="94">Beyond the far-fet merchandise :</l>
     <l n="95">Obedience , wise distrust , peace , shy</l>
     <l n="96">Distance and sweet urbanity ;</l>

     <l n="76">The sad soul went , not with his love , but doom ,</l>
     <l n="77">Shooting his eyedarts ‘ gainst it to surprise</l>
     <l n="78">It , or to draw the city to his eyes .</l>
     <l n="79">Such is my parting with thee , and to prove</l>
     <l n="80">There was not varnish only in my love ,</l>
     <l n="81">But substance , lo ! receive this pearly tear</l>
     <l n="82">Frozen with grief and place it in thine ear .</l>
     <l n="83">Then part in name of peace , and softly on</l>
     <l n="84">With numerous feet to hoofy Helicon ;</l>
     <l n="85">And when thou art upon that forked hill</l>
     <l n="86">Amongst the thrice three sacred virgins , fill</l>
     <l n="87">A full-brimm 'd bowl of fury and of rage ,</l>
     <l n="88">And quaff it to the prophets of our age ;</l>
     <l n="89">When drunk with rapture curse the blind and lame ,</l>
     <l n="90">Base ballad-mongers who usurp thy name</l>
     <l n="91">And foul thy altar ; charm some into frogs ,</l>
     <l n="92">Some to be rats , and others to be hogs ;</l>
     <l n="93">Into the loathsom'st shapes thou canst devise</l>
     <l n="94">To make fools hate them , only by disguise ;</l>
     <l n="95">Thus with a kiss of warmth and love I part</l>
     <l n="96">Not so , but that some relic in my heart</l>
     <l n="97">Shall stand for ever , though I do address</l>
     <l n="98">Chiefly myself to what I must profess .</l>
     <l n="99">Know yet , rare soul , when my diviner muse</l>

    <p n="29">Gallant Newark . Robert Pierrepoint was created Viscount Newark in 1627 and Earl of Kingston in the following year . But Herrick is perhaps addressing his son , Henry Pierrepoint , afterwards Marquis of Dorchester ( see 962 and Note ) , who during the first Earl of Kingston 's life would presumably have borne his second title .</p>

    <p n="35">653 . To th ’ number five or nine . Probably Herrick is mistaking the references in Greek and Latin poets to the mixing of their wine and water ( e. g ., Hor . Od . III . xix . 11-17 ) for the drinking of so many cups .</p>
    <p n="36">654 . Long-looked-for comes at last . Cp . G. Herbert , preface to Sibbes ’ Funeral Sermon on Sir Thomas Crew ( 1638 ): “ That ancient adage , ‘ Quod differtur non aufertur ’ for ‘ Long-looked-for comes at last ’ ” .</p>

    <p n="51">683 . But a just measure both of Heat and Cold . This is a version of the medieval doctrine of the four humours . So Chaucer says of his Doctor of Physic :—</p>
    <p n="52">“ He knew the cause of every maladye , Were it of hoot or cold , or moyste , or drye , And where engendered and of what humour ” .</p>
    <p n="53">684 . ‘ Gainst thou go'st ahYpppHeNmothering . The Epistle for Mid-Lent Sunday was from Galat . iv . 21 , etc ., and contained the words : “ Jerusalem , quæ est Mater nostra ” . On that Sunday people made offerings at their Mother Church . After the Reformation the natural mother was substituted for the spiritual , and the day was set apart for visiting relations . Excellent simnel cakes ( Low Lat ., siminellus , fine flour ) are still made in the North , where the current derivation of the word is from Sim and Nell !</p>
    <p n="54">685 . To the King . Probably written in 1645 , when Charles was for a short time in the West .</p>

    <p n="60">709 . Tears and Laughter . Bishop Jebb quotes a Latin couplet inscribed on an old inn at Four Crosses , Staffordshire :—</p>

    <p n="69">727 . Up tails all . This tune will be found in Chappell 's Popular Music of the Olden Time , vol . i. p. 196 . He notes that it was a favourite with Herrick , who wrote four other poems in the metre , viz . : The Hag is Astride , The Maypole is up , The Peter-penny , and Twelfth Night : or , King and Queen . The tune is found in Queen Elizabeth 's Virginal Book , and in the Dancing Master ( 1650-1690 ) . It is alluded to by Ben Jonson , and was a favourite with the Cavaliers .</p>
    <p n="70">730 . Charon and Philomel . This dialogue is found with some slight variations of text in Rawlinson 's MS. poet . 65. fol . 32 . The following variants may be noted : l. 5 , voice for sound ; l. 7 , shade for bird ; l. 11 , warbling for watching ; l. 12 , hoist up for thus hoist ; l. 13 , be gone for return ; l. 18 , praise for pray ; l. 19 , sighs for vows ; l. 24 , omit slothful . The dialogue is succeeded in the MS. by an old catch ( probably written before Herrick was born ):—</p>
    <p n="71">“ A boat ! a boat ! haste to the ferry ! For we go over to be merry , To laugh and quaff , and drink old sherry ” .</p>
    <p n="72">After the catch comes the following dialogue , written ( it would seem ) in imitation of Herrick 's Charon and Philomel : the speakers ’ names are not marked :—</p>
    <p n="73">“ Charon ! O Charon ! the wafter of all souls to bliss or bane ! Who calls the ferryman of Hell ? Come near and say who lives in bliss and who in pain . Those that die well eternal bliss shall follow . Those that die ill their own black deeds shall swallow . Shall thy black barge those guilty spirits row That kill themselves for love ? Oh , no ! oh , no ! My cordage cracks when such foul sins draw near , No wind blows fair , nor I my boat can steer . What spirits pass and in Elysium reign ? Those harmless souls that love and are beloved again . That soul that lives in love and fain would die to win , Shall he go free ? Oh , no ! it is too foul a sin . He must not come aboard , I dare not row , Storms of despair my boat will overblow . But when thy mistress (? ) shall close up thine eyes then come aboard , Then come aboard and pass ; till then be wise and sing . ”</p>
    <p n="74">“ Then come aboard ” from the penultimate line and “ and sing ” from the last should clearly be struck out .</p>

    <p n="99">804 . John Crofts , Cup-bearer to the King . Third son of Sir John Crofts , of Saxham , Suffolk . We hear of him in the king 's service as early as 1628 , and two years later Lord Conway , in thanking Wm . Weld for some verses sent him , hopes “ the lines are strong enough to bind Robert Maule and Jack Crofts from ever more using the phrase ” . So Jack was probably a bit of a poet himself . He may be the Mr. Crofts for assaulting whom George , Lord Digby , was imprisoned a month and more , in 1634 .</p>
    <p n="100">807 . Man may want land to live in . Tacitus , Ann . xiii . 56 : Addidit [ Boiocalus ] Deësse nobis terra in quâ vivamus , in quâ moriamur non potest , quoted by Montaigne , II . 3 .</p>

    <p n="152">947 . To his honoured and most ingenious friend , Mr. Charles Cotton . Dr. Grosart annotates : “ The translator of Montaigne , and associate of Izaak Walton ” ; but as the younger Cotton was only eighteen when Hesperides was printed , it is perhaps more probable that the father is meant , though we may note that Herrick and the younger Cotton were joint-contributors in 1649 to the Lacrymæ Musarum , published in memory of Lord Hastings .

Hall remained at Cambridge till 1647 , and this poem , which addresses him as a “ Student of Gray 's Inn , ” must therefore have been written almost while Hesperides was passing through the press . Hall 's Horæ Vacivæ , or Essays , published in 1646 , had at once given him high rank among the wits .</p>
    <p n="158">958 . To the most comely and proper M. Elizabeth Finch . No certain identification has been proposed .</p>
    <p n="159">961 . To the King , upon his welcome to Hampton Court , set and sung . The allusion can only be to the king 's stay at Hampton Court in 1647 . Good hope was then entertained of a peaceful settlement , and Herrick 's ode , enthusiastic as it is , expresses little more than this .</p>
    <p n="160">For an ascendent , etc . : This and the next seven lines are taken from phrases on pp . 29-33 of the Notes and Observations on some passages of Scripture , by John Gregory ( see note on N. N. 178 ) . According to Gregory , “ The Ascendent of a City is that sign which riseth in the Heavens at the laying of the first stone ” .</p>
    <p n="161">962 . Henry , Marquis of Dorchester . Henry Pierrepoint , second Earl of Kingston , succeeded his father ( Herrick 's Newark ) July 30 , 1643 , and was created Marquis of Dorchester , March , 1645 . “ He was a very studious nobleman and very learned , particularly in law and physics . ” ( See Burke 's Extinct Peerages , iii . 435 . )</p>
    <p n="162">When Cato , the severe , entered the circumspacious theatre . The allusion is to the visit of Cato to the games of Flora , given by Messius . When his presence in the theatre was known , the dancing-women were not allowed to perform in their accustomed lack of costume , whereupon the moralist obligingly retired , amidst applause .</p>
    <p n="163">966 . M. Jo . Harmar , physician to the College of Westminster . John Harmar , born at Churchdown , near Gloucester , about 1594 , was educated at Winchester and Magdalen College , Oxford ; was a master at Magdalen School , the Free School at St. Albans , and at Westminster , and Professor of Greek at Oxford under the Commonwealth . He died 1670 . Wood characterises him as a butt for the wits and a flatterer of great men , and notes that he was always called by the name of Doctor Harmar , though he took no higher degree than M. A . But in 1632 he supplicated for the degree of M. B ., and Dr. Grosart 's note — “ Herrick , no doubt , playfully transmuted ‘ Doctor ’ into ‘ Physician ’ ” — is misleading . He may have cared for the minds and bodies of the Westminster boys at one and the same time .</p>
    <p n="164">The Roman language .... If Jove would speak , etc . Cp . Ben Jonson 's Discoveries : “ that testimony given by L. Aelius Stilo upon Plautus who affirmed , “ Musas si latine loqui voluissent Plautino sermone fuisse loquuturas ” . And Cicero [ in Plutarch , § 24 ] “ said of the Dialogues of Plato , that Jupiter , if it were his nature to use language , would speak like him ” .</p>

    <p n="176">1002 . To the Lord Hopton on his fight in Cornwall . Sir Ralph Hopton won two brilliant victories for the Royalists , at Bradock Down and Stratton , January and May , 1643 , and was created Baron Hopton in the following September . Originally a Parliamentarian , he was one of the king 's ablest and most loyal servants .</p>

    <p n="182">1026 . Saint Distaff 's Day . “ Saint Distaff is perhaps only a coinage of our poet 's to designate the day when , the Christmas vacation being over , good housewives , with others , resumed their usual employment . ” ( Nott . ) The phrase is explained in dictionaries and handbooks , but no other use of it is quoted than this . Herrick 's poem was pilfered by Henry Bold ( a notorious plagiarist ) in Wit a-sporting in a pleasant Grove of New Fancies , 1657 .</p>
    <p n="183">1028 . My beloved Westminster . As mentioned in the brief “ Life ” of Herrick prefixed to vol . i ., all the references in this poem seem to refer to Herrick 's courtier-days , between leaving Cambridge and going to Devonshire . He then , doubtless , resided in Westminster for the sake of proximity to Whitehall . It has been suggested , however , that the reference is to Westminster School , but we have no evidence that Herrick was educated there .</p>
    <p n="184">Golden Cheapside . My friend , Mr. Herbert Horne , in his admirably-chosen selection from the Hesperides , suggests that the allusion here is to the great gilt cross at the end of Wood Street . The suggestion is ingenious ; but as Cheapside was the goldsmiths ’ quarter this would amply justify the epithet , which may indeed only refer to Cheapside as a money-winning street , as we might say Golden Lombard Street .</p>
    <p n="185">1032 . Things are uncertain . Tiberius , in Tacitus , Annal . i . 72 : Cuncta mortalium incerta ; quantoque plus adeptus foret , tanto se magis in lubrico .</p>
    <p n="186">1034 . Good wits get more fame by their punishment . Cp . Tacit . Ann . iv . 35 , sub fin . : Punitis ingeniis gliscit auctoritas , etc ., quoted by Bacon and Milton .</p>
    <p n="187">1035 . Twelfth Night : or King and Queen . Herrick alludes to these “ Twelfth-Tide Kings and Queens ” in writing to Endymion Porter ( 662 ) , and earlier still , in the “ New-Year 's Gift to Sir Simeon Steward ” ( 319 ) he speaks —</p>
    <p n="188">“ Of Twelfth-Tide cakes , of Peas and Beans , Wherewith ye make those merry scenes , Whenas ye choose your King and Queen ” .</p>
    <p n="189">Brand ( i . 27 ) illustrates well from “ Speeches to the Queen at Sudley ” in Nichols ’ Progresses of Queen Elizabeth .</p>
    <p n="190">“ Melibœus . Cut the cake : who hath the bean shall be king , and where the pea is , she shall be queen .</p>
    <p n="191">Nisa . I have the pea and must be queen .</p>
    <p n="192">Mel . I the bean , and king . I must command . ”</p>
    <p n="193">1045 . Comfort in Calamity . An allusion to the ejection from their benefices which befel most of the loyal clergy at the same time as Herrick . It is perhaps worth noting that in the second volume of this edition , and in the last hundred poems printed in the first , wherever a date can be fixed it is always in the forties . Equally late poems occur , though much less frequently , among the first five hundred , but there the dated poems belong , for the most part , to the years 1623-1640 . Now , in April 29 , 1640 , as stated in the brief “ Life ” prefixed to vol . i ., there was entered at Stationers ’ Hall , “ The severall poems written by Master Robert Herrick , ” a book which , as far as is known , never saw the light . It was probably , however , to this book that Herrick addressed the poem ( 405 ) beginning :—</p>
    <p n="194">“ Have I not blest thee ? Then go forth , nor fear Or spice , or fish , or fire , or close-stools here ” ;</p>
    <p n="195">and we may fairly regard the first five hundred poems of Hesperides as representing the intended collection of 1640 , with a few additions , and the last six hundred as for the most part later , and I must add , inferior work . This is borne out by the absence of any manuscript versions of poems in the second half of the book . Herrick 's verses would only be passed from hand to hand when he was living among the wits in London .</p>
    <p n="196">1046 . Twilight . Ovid , Amores , I. v. 5 , 6 : Crepuscula ... ubi nox abiit , nec tamen orta dies .</p>

    <p n="200">1053 . Sincerity . From Hor . Ep . I. ii . 54 : Sincerum est nisi vas , quodcunque infundis acescit . Quoted by Montaigne , III . xiii .</p>
    <p n="201">1056 . To his peculiar friend , M. Jo . Wicks . See 336 and Note . Written after Herrick 's ejection . We know that the poet 's uncle , Sir William Herrick , suffered greatly in estate during the Civil War , and it may have been the same with other friends and relatives . But there can be little doubt that the poet found abundant hospitality on his return to London .</p>
    <p n="202">1059 . A good Death . August . de Disciplin . Christ . 13 : Non potest malè mori , qui benè vixerit .</p>
    <p n="203">1061 . On Fortune . Seneca , Medea , 176 : Fortuna opes auferre non animum potest .</p>
    <p n="204">1062 . To Sir George Parry , Doctor of the Civil Law . According to Dr. Grosart , Parry “ was admitted to the College of Advocates , London , 3rd Nov ., 1628 ; but almost nothing has been transmitted concerning him save that he married the daughter and heir of Sir Giles Sweet , Dean of Arches ” . I can hardly doubt that he must be identified with the Dr. George Parry , Chancellor to the Bishop of Exeter , who in 1630 was accused of excommunicating persons for the sake of fees , but was highly praised in 1635 and soon after appointed a Judge Marshal . If so , his wife was a widow when she came to him , as she is spoken of in 1638 as “ Lady Dorothy Smith , wife of Sir Nicholas Smith , deceased ” . She brought him a rich dower , and her death greatly confused his affairs .</p>
    <p n="205">1067 . Gentleness . Seneca , Phoen . 659 : Qui vult amari , languidâ regnet manu . And Ben Jonson , Panegyre ( 1603 ): “ He knew that those who would with love command , Must with a tender yet a steadfast hand , Sustain the reins ” .</p>
    <p n="206">1068 . Mrs. Eliza Wheeler . See 130 and Note .</p>
    <p n="207">1071 . To the Honoured Master Endymion Porter . For Porter 's patronage of poetry see 117 and Note .</p>
    <p n="208">1080 . The Mistress of all singular Manners , Mistress Portman . Dr. Grosart notes that a Mrs. Mary Portman was buried at Putney Parish Church , June 27 , 1671 , and this was perhaps Herrick 's schoolmistress , the “ pearl of Putney ” .</p>
    <p n="209">1087 . Where pleasures rule a kingdom . Cicero , De Senect . xii . 41 : Neque omnino in voluptatis regno virtutem posse consistere . He lives who lives to virtue . Comp . Sallust , Catil . 2 , s. fin .</p>
    <p n="210">1088 . Twice five-and-twenty ( bate me but one year ) . As Herrick was born in 1591 , this poem must have been written in 1640 .</p>
    <p n="211">1089 . To M. Laurence Swetnaham . Unless the various entries in the parish registers of St. Margaret 's , Westminster , refer to different men , this Lawrence Swetnaham was the third son of Thomas Swettenham of Swettenham in Cheshire , married in 1602 to Mary Birtles . Lawrence himself had children as early as 1629 , and ten years later was church-warden . He was buried in the Abbey , 1673 .</p>

    <p n="213">1092 . Michael Oulsworth . Michael Oulsworth , Oldsworth or Oldisworth , graduated M. A . from Magdalen College , Oxford , in 1614 . According to Wood , “ he was afterwards Fellow of his College , Secretary to Earl of Pembroke , elected a burgess to serve in several Parliaments for Sarum and Old Sarum , and though in the Grand Rebellion he was no Colonel , yet he was Governor of Old Pembroke , and Montgomery led him by the nose as he pleased , to serve both their turns ” . The partnership , however , was not eternal , for between 1648 and 1650 Oldisworth published at least eight virulent satires against his former master .</p>

    <p n="235">38 . Upon Time . Were this poem anonymous it would probably be attributed rather to George Herbert than to Herrick .</p>
    <p n="236">41 . His Litany to the Holy Spirit . We may quote again from Barron Field 's account in the Quarterly Review ( 1810 ) of his cross-examination of the Dean Prior villagers for Reminiscences of Herrick : “ The person , however , who knows more of Herrick than all the rest of the neighbourhood we found to be a poor woman in the 99th year of her age , named Dorothy King . She repeated to us , with great exactness , five of his Noble Numbers , among which was his beautiful ‘ Litany ’ . These she had learnt from her mother , who was apprenticed to Herrick 's successor at the vicarage . She called them her prayers , which she said she was in the habit of putting up in bed , whenever she could not sleep ; and she therefore began the ‘ Litany ’ at the second stanza :—</p>
    <p n="237">‘ When I lie within my bed , ’ etc . ”</p>
    <p n="238">Another of her midnight orisons was the poem beginning :—</p>
    <p n="239">“ Every night Thou dost me fright , And keep mine eyes from sleeping , ” etc .</p>
    <p n="240">The last couplet , it should be noted , is misquoted from No . 56 .</p>

    <p n="244">65 . My Alma . The name is probably suggested by its meaning “ soul ” . Cp . Prior 's Alma .</p>
    <p n="245">72 . I 'll cast a mist and cloud . Cp . Hor . I. Ep . xvi . 62 : Noctem peccatis et fraudibus objice nubem .</p>

    <p n="247">77 . Lighten my candle , etc . The phraseology of the next five lines is almost entirely from the Psalms and the Song of Solomon .</p>
    <p n="248">86 . Sin leads the way . Hor . Odes , III . ii . 32 : Raro antecedentem scelestum Deseruit pede Poena claudo .</p>
    <p n="249">88 . By Faith we ... walk ..., not by the Spirit . 2 Cor . v. 7 : “ We walk by faith , not by sight ” . ‘ By the Spirit ’ perhaps means , ‘ in spiritual bodies ’ .</p>

    <p n="253">We 'll choose him King . A reference to the Twelfth Night games . See Hesperides 1035 , and Note .</p>
    <p n="254">108 . Good men afflicted most . Taken almost entirely from Seneca , de Provid . 3 , 4 : Ignem experitur [ Fortuna ] in Mucio , paupertatem in Fabricio , ... tormenta in Regulo , venenum in Socrate , mortem in Catone . The allusions may be briefly explained for the unclassical . At the siege of Dyrrachium , Marcus Cassius Scæva caught 120 darts on his shield ; Horatius Cocles is the hero of the bridge ( see Macaulay 's Lays ) ; C. Mucius Scævola held his hand in the fire to illustrate to Porsenna Roman fearlessness ; Cato is Cato Uticensis , the philosophic suicide ; “ high Atilius ” will be more easily recognised as the M. Atilius Regulus who defied the Carthaginians ; Fabricius Luscinus refused not only the presents of Pyrrhus , but all reward of the State , and lived in poverty on his own farm .</p>
    <p n="255">109 . A wood of darts . Cp . Virg . Æn . x . 886 : Ter secum Troius heros Immanem aerato circumfert tegmine silvam .</p>
    <p n="256">112 . The Recompense . Herrick is said to have assumed the lay habit on his return to London after his ejection , perhaps as a protection against further persecution . This quatrain may be taken as evidence that he did not throw off his religion with his cassock . Compare also 124 .</p>
    <p n="257">All I have lost that could be rapt from me . From Ovid , III . Trist . vii . 414 : Raptaque sint adimi quae potuere mihi .</p>

My clerical predecessor has also hunted down with much industry the possible sources of most of the other patristic references in Noble Numbers , though I have been able to add a few . We may note that Herrick quotes Cassiodorus ( twice ) , John of Damascus , Boethius , Thomas Aquinas , St. Bernard , St. Augustine ( thrice ) , St . Basil , and St. Ambrose — a goodly list of Fathers , if we had any reason to suppose that the quotations were made at first hand .</p>

    <p n="268">167 . A dereliction . The word is from Ps . xxii . 1 : Quare me dereliquisti ? “ Why hast Thou forsaken me ? ” Herrick took it from Gregory 's Notes and Observations ( see infra ) , p. 5 : ‘ Our Saviour ... in that great case of dereliction ’ .</p>

    <p n="271">178 . The Jews when they built houses . Herrick 's rabbinical lore ( cp . 180 , 181 , 193 , 207 , 224 ) , like his patristic , was probably derived at second hand through some biblical commentary . Much of it certainly comes from the Notes and Observations upon some Passages of Scripture ( Oxford , 1646 ) of John Gregory , chaplain of Christ Church , a prodigy of oriental learning , who died in his 39th year , March 13 , 1646 . Thus in his Address to the Reader ( 3rd page from end ) Gregory remarks : “ The Jews , when they build a house , are bound to leave some part of it unfinished in memory of the destruction of Jerusalem , ” giving a reference to Leo of Modena , Degli Riti Hebraici , Part I .</p>

This is the confusion or “ level-coil ” to which he alludes .</p>

    <head>APPENDIX I .</head>
    <p n="310">HERRICK 'S POEMS IN WITTS RECREATIONS .</p>
    <p n="311">Both Mr. Hazlitt and Dr. Grosart have slightly misrepresented the relation of Hesperides to the anthology known as Witts Recreations : Mr. Hazlitt by mistakes as to their respective contents ; Dr. Grosart ( after a much more careful collation ) by taking down the date of the wrong edition . To put matters straight four editions have to be examined :—</p>
    <p n="312">I . “ Witts Recreations . Selected from the finest Fancies of Moderne Muses , With a Thousand out Landish Proverbs . London . Printed for Humph . Blunden at ye Castle in Cornhill , 1640 . 8vo . ”</p>
    <p n="313">This general title-page is engraved by W. Marshall . The Outlandish Proverbs were selected by George Herbert , and , like the first part , have a printed title-page of their own .</p>
    <p n="314">II . “ Witts Recreations . Augmented with Ingenious Conceites for the wittie and Merrie Medicines for the Melancholie . London . Printed for Humph . Blunden : at ye Castle in Cornhill , 1641 . 8vo . ”</p>
    <p n="315">In this , and subsequent editions , Marshall 's title-page is re-engraved and the Outlandish Proverbs are omitted . The printed title-page reads : “ Wit 's Recreations . Containing 630 Epigrams , 160 Epitaphs . Variety of Fancies and Fantasticks , Good for Melancholly humours . London . Printed by Thomas Cotes , ” etc . The epigrams vary considerably from the selection in the previous edition .</p>
    <p n="316">III . “ Witts Recreations refined . Augmented , with Ingenious Conceites for the wittie , and Merrie Medicines for the Melancholie .... ”</p>
    <p n="317">In the Museum copy of this edition the imprint to the engraved title has been cropped away . The printed title-page reads : “ Recreation for Ingenious Head-peeces . Or , A Pleasant Grove for their Wits to walke in . Of Epigrams , 630 : Epitaphs , 180 : Fancies , a number : Fantasticks , abundance , Good for melancholy Humors . Printed by R. Cotes for H. B. London , 1645 . 8vo . ” Two poems of Herrick 's occur in the additional “ Fancies and Fantasticks , ” first printed in this edition , viz . : The Description of a Woman ( not contained in Hesperides ) , and the Farewell to Sack .</p>
    <p n="318">IV . “ Witts Recreations refined . Augmented , with Ingenious Conceites for the wittie and Merrie Medicines for the Melancholie . Printed by M. S. sould by I. Hancock in Popes head Alley , 1650 . 8vo . ”</p>
    <p n="319">The printed title-page reads : “ Recreations for Ingenious Head-peeces . Or , A Pleasant Grove for their Wits to Walke in . Of Epigrams , 700 : Epitaphs , 200 : Fancies , a number : Fantasticks , abundance . With their Addition , Multiplication , and Division . London , Printed by M. Simmons , ” etc . In this edition many of the Epigrams are omitted and more than one hundred fresh ones added . Additions are also made to the Epitaphs and Fancies and Fantasticks . Of the new Epigrams and Poems no less than seventy-two had been printed two years earlier in Herrick 's Hesperides , and ten others were added in 1654 from the same source .</p>
    <p n="320">Witts Recreations was again reprinted in 1663 , 1667 , and perhaps oftener . In 1817 it was issued as vol . ii . of a collection of Facetiæ , of which Mennis and Smith 's Musarum Deliciæ and Wit Restor 'd formed vol . i . On the title-page Witts Recreations is said to be printed from edition 1640 , with all the wood engravings and improvements of subsequent editions , and in the preface it is explained to be “ reprinted after a collation of the four editions , 1640 , 41 , 54 , and 63 , for the purpose of bringing together in one body all the various articles spread throughout , and not to be found in any one edition ” . This 1817 reprint was re-issued by Hotten in 1874 , and this re-issue , as his references to pagination show , was the one used by Dr. Grosart . The date 1640 on the title-page may have caught his eye and led to his mistaken allusion to the “ prior publication ” of the Herrick poems in 1640 , whereas Hesperides was published in 1648 , and the editions of Witts Recreations which contain anything of his besides the Description of a Woman and A Farewell to Sack , in 1650 , 1654 , etc .</p>
    <p n="321">In the Notes to the present edition I have drawn attention to all variations in the text of the poems as printed by Herrick and the later editors , and now subjoin a complete list of the poems under the titles which they take in Witts Recreations , with their numbers in this edition .</p>

    <p n="329">HERRICK 'S FAIRY POEMS AND THE DESCRIPTION OF THE KING AND QUEENE OF FAYRIES PUBLISHED 1635 .</p>
   </div>
   <div type="dedication">
    <p>The publisher 's freak , by which Herrick 's three chief Fairy poems ( “ The Fairy Temple ; or , Oberon 's Chapel , ” “ Oberon 's Feast , ” and “ Oberon 's Palace ” ) are separated from each other , is greatly to be regretted . The last two , both dedicated to Shapcott , are distinctly connected by their opening lines , and “ Oberon 's Chapel , ” dedicated to Mr. John Merrifield , Herrick 's other fairy-loving lawyer , of course belongs to the same group . All three were probably first written in 1626 and cannot be dissociated from Drayton 's Nymphidia , published in 1627 , and Sir Simeon Steward 's “ A Description of the King of Fayries clothes , brought to him on New-yeares day in the morning , 1626 [ O. S .] , by his Queenes Chambermaids ” . In 1635 there was published a little book of a dozen leaves , most kindly transcribed for this edition by Mr. E. Gordon Duff , from the unique copy at the Bodleian Library . It is entitled :— “ A | Description | of the King and Queene of | Fayries , their habit , fare , their | abode pompe and state . | Beeing very delightfull to the sense , and | full of mirth . | [ Wood-cut . ] London . | Printed for Richard Harper , and are to be sold | at his shop , at the Hospitall gate . 1635 . ” Fol . 1 is blank ; fol . 2 occupied by the title-page ; ff . 3 , 4 ( verso blank ) by a letter “ To the Reader , ” signed : “ Yours hereafter , If now approved on , R. S ., ” beginning : “ Courteous Reader , I present thee here with the Description of the King of the Fayries , of his Attendants , Apparel , Gesture , and Victuals , which though comprehended in the brevity of so short a volume , yet as the Proverbe truely averres , it hath as mellifluous and pleasing discourse , as that whose amplitude contains the fulnesse of a bigger composition ” ; on fol . 5 ( verso blank ) occurs the following poem [ spelling here modernised ]:— “ Deep-skilled Geographers , whose art and skill Do traverse all the world , and with their quill Declare the strangeness of each several clime , The nature , situation , and the time Of being inhabited , yet all their art And deep informèd skill could not impart In what set climate of this Orb or Isle , The King of Fairies kept , whose honoured style Is here inclosed , with the sincere description Of his abode , his nature , and the region In which he rules : read , and thou shalt find Delightful mirth , fit to content thy mind . May the contents thereof thy palate suit , With its mellifluous and pleasing fruit : For nought can more be sweetened to my mind Than that this Pamphlet thy contentment find ; Which if it shall , my labour is sufficed , In being by your liking highly prized . “ Yours to his power , “ R. S . ” This is followed ( pp . 1-3 ) by : “ A Description of the Kings [ sic ] of Fayries Clothes , brought to him on New-Yeares day in the morning , 1626 , by his Queenes Chambermaids :— “ First a cobweb shirt , more thin Than ever spider since could spin . Changed to the whiteness of the snow , By the stormy winds that blow In the vast and frozen air , No shirt half so fine , so fair ; A rich waistcoat they did bring , Made of the Trout-fly 's gilded wing : At which his Elveship ‘ gan to fret The wearing it would make him sweat Even with its weight : he needs would wear A waistcoat made of downy hair New shaven off an Eunuch 's chin , That pleased him well , ‘ twas wondrous thin . The outside of his doublet was Made of the four-leaved , true-loved grass , Changed into so fine a gloss , With the oil of crispy moss : It made a rainbow in the night Which gave a lustre passing light . On every seam there was a lace Drawn by the unctuous snail 's slow pace , To which the finest , purest , silver thread Compared , did look like dull pale lead . His breeches of the Fleece was wrought , Which from Colchos Jason brought : Spun into so fine a yarn No mortal wight might it discern , Weaved by Arachne on her loom , Just before she had her doom . A rich Mantle he did wear , Made of tinsel gossamer . Beflowered over with a few Diamond stars of morning dew : Dyed crimson in a maiden 's blush , Lined with humble-bees ’ lost plush . His cap was all of ladies ’ love , So wondrous light , that it did move If any humming gnat or fly Buzzed the air in passing by , About his neck a wreath of pearl , Dropped from the eyes of some poor girl , Pinched , because she had forgot To leave clean water in the pot . ” The next page is occupied by a woodcut , and then ( pp . 5 , misnumbered 4 , and 6 ) comes the variation on Herrick 's “ Oberon 's Feast ":— “ A DESCRIPTION OF HIS DIET . “ Now they , the Elves , within a trice , Prepared a feast less great than nice , Where you may imagine first , The Elves prepare to quench his thirst , In pure seed pearl of infant dew Brought and sweetened with a blue And pregnant violet ; which done , His killing eyes begin to run Quite o'er the table , where he spies The horns of watered butterflies , Of which he eats , but with a little Neat cool allay of cuckoo 's spittle . Next this the red-cap worm that 's shut Within the concave of a nut . Moles ’ eyes he tastes , then adders ’ ears ; To these for sauce the slain stags ’ tears , A bloated earwig , and the pith Of sugared rush he glads him with . Then he takes a little moth , Late fatted in a scarlet cloth , A spinner 's ham , the beards of mice , Nits carbonadoed , a device Before unknown ; the blood of fleas , Which gave his Elveship 's stomach ease . The unctuous dew-laps of a snail , The broke heart of a nightingale O'ercome in music , with the sag And well-bestrutted bee 's sweet bag . Conserves of atoms , and the mites , The silk-worm 's sperm , and the delights Of all that ever yet hath blest Fairy-land : so ends his feast . ” On the next page is printed : “ Orpheus . Thrice excelling , for the finishment of this Feast , thou must music it so that the Deities may descend to grace it . ” This is succeeded by a page bearing a woodcut , then we have “ The Fairies Fegaries , ” a poem occupying three more pages followed by another woodcut , and then “ The Melancholly Lover 's Song , ” and a third woodcut . The occurrence of the Melancholy Lover 's Song ( the well-known lines beginning : “ Hence all you vain delights ” ) in print in 1635 is interesting , as I believe that The Nice Valour , the play in which they occur , was not printed till 1647 , and Milton 's Il Penseroso , which they suggested , appeared in 1645 . But the verses are rather out of place in the little Fairy-Book .</p>

    <head>APPENDIX III .</head>
    <p n="330">POOR ROBIN 'S ALMANACK .</p>
    <p n="331">Herrick 's name has been so persistently connected with Poor Robert 's Almanack that a few words must be said on the subject . There is , we are told , a Devonshire tradition ascribing the Almanack to him , and this is accepted by Nichols in his Leicestershire , and “ accredited ” by Dr. Grosart . The tradition apparently rests on no better basis than Herrick 's Christian name , and of the poems in the issues of the Almanack which I have seen , it may be said , that , while the worst of them , save for some lack of neatness of turn , might conceivably have been by Herrick — on the principle that if Herrick could write some of his epigrams , he could write anything — the more ambitious poems it is quite impossible to attribute to the author of the Hesperides . But apart from opinion , the negative evidence is overwhelming . Of the three earliest issues in the British Museum , 1664 , 1667 and 1669 ( all in the annual collections of Almanacs , issued by the Stationers ’ Company , and all , it may be noted , bound for Charles II . ) , I transcribe the title-page of the first . “ Poor Robin . 1664 . An Almanack After a New Fashion wherein the Reader may see ( if he be not blinde ) many remarkable things worthy of Observation . Containing a two-fold Kalendar , viz . the Iulian or English , and the Roundheads or Fanaticks : with their several Saints daies and Observations , upon every month . Written by Poor Robin , Knight of the burnt Island and a well-willer to the Mathematicks . Calculated for the Meridian of Saffron Walden , where the Pole is elevated 52 degrees and 6 minutes above the Horizon . London : Printed for the Company of Stationers . ”</p>
    <p n="332">In the 1667 issue the paragraph about the Pole runs : “ Where the Maypole is elevated ( with a plumm cake on the top of it ) 5 yards ¾ above the Market Cross ” . The mention of Saffron Walden had apparently been ridiculed , and the author in this year joins in the laugh , and in 1669 omits the paragraph altogether . But what had Herrick at any time to do with Saffron Walden , and why should the poet , whose politics , apart from some personal devotion to Charles I ., were distinctly moderate , mix himself up with an ultra-Cavalier publication ? Also , if Herrick be “ Poor Robin ” we must attribute to him , at least , the greater part of the twenty-one “ Poor Robin ” publications , of which Mr. H. Ecroyd Smith gave a list in Notes and Queries , 6th series , vii . 321-3 , e. g ., “ Poor Robin 's Perambulation from the Town of Saffron Walden to London ” ( 1678 ) , “ The Merrie Exploits of Poor Robin , the Merrie Saddler of Walden , ” etc . These have been generally assigned to William Winstanley , the barber-poet , on the ground of a supposed similarity of style , and from “ Poor Robin ” having been written under a portrait of him . Mr. Ecroyd Smith , however , attributes them to Robert Winstanley ( born , 1646 , at Saffron Walden ) , younger brother of Henry Winstanley , the projector of the Eddystone Lighthouse . He assigns the credit of the “ identification ” to Mr. Joseph Clark , F. S. A ., of the Roos , Saffron Walden , but does not state the grounds which led Mr. Clark to his conclusion , in itself probable enough . In any case there is no valid ground for connecting Herrick either with the Almanack or with any of the other “ Poor Robin ” publications .</p>

    <head>APPENDIX OF EPIGRAMS .</head>
    <p n="334">5 . [ TO HIS BOOK . ] ANOTHER .</p>
    <p n="335">Who with thy leaves shall wipe , at need , The place where swelling piles do breed ; May every ill that bites or smarts Perplex him in his hinder parts .</p>
    <p n="336">6 . TO THE SOUR READER .</p>
    <p n="337">If thou dislik'st the piece thou light'st on first , Think that of all , that I have writ , the worst : But if thou read'st my book unto the end , And still do'st this and that verse , reprehend ; O perverse man ! if all disgustful be , The extreme scab take thee , and thine , for me .</p>
    <p n="338">41 . THE VINE .</p>
    <p n="339">I dreamt this mortal part of mine Was metamorphos 'd to a vine ; Which crawling one and every way Enthrall 'd my dainty Lucia . Methought , her long small legs and thighs I with my tendrils did surprise ; Her belly , buttocks , and her waist By my soft nerv'lets were embrac 'd ; About her head I writhing hung , } And with rich clusters , hid among } The leaves , her temples I behung : } So that my Lucia seem 'd to me Young Bacchus ravish 'd by his tree . My curls about her neck did crawl , And arms and hands they did enthrall : So that she could not freely stir , All parts there made one prisoner . But when I crept with leaves to hide Those parts , which maids keep unespy 'd , Such fleeting pleasures there I took , That with the fancy I awoke ; And found , ah me ! this flesh of mine More like a stock than like a vine .</p>
    <p n="340">64 . ONCE POOR , STILL PENURIOUS .</p>
    <p n="341">Goes the world now , it will with thee go hard : The fattest hogs we grease the more with lard . To him that has , there shall be added more ; Who is penurious , he shall still be poor .</p>
    <p n="342">99 . UPON BLANCH .</p>
    <p n="343">Blanch swears her husband 's lovely ; when a scald Has blear 'd his eyes : besides , his head is bald Next , his wild ears , like leathern wings full spread , Flutter to fly , and bear away his head .</p>
    <p n="344">109 . UPON CUFFE . EPIG .</p>
    <p n="345">Cuffe comes to church much : but he keeps his bed Those Sundays only whenas briefs are read . This makes Cuffe dull ; and troubles him the most , Because he cannot sleep i ’ th ’ church free cost .</p>
    <p n="346">Briefs .— Letters recommending the collection of alms .</p>
    <p n="347">110 . UPON FONE A SCHOOLMASTER . EPIG .</p>
    <p n="348">Fone says , those mighty whiskers he does wear Are twigs of birch , and willow , growing there : If so , we 'll think too , when he does condemn Boys to the lash , that he does whip with them .</p>
    <p n="349">126 . UPON SCOBBLE . EPIG .</p>
    <p n="350">Scobble for whoredom whips his wife ; and cries He 'll slit her nose ; but blubb'ring , she replies , Good sir , make no more cuts i ’ th ’ outward skin , One slit 's enough to let adultry in .</p>
    <p n="351">129 . UPON GLASCO . EPIG .</p>
    <p n="352">Glasco had none , but now some teeth has got ; Which though they fur , will neither ache or rot . Six teeth he has , whereof twice two are known Made of a haft that was a mutton bone . Which not for use , but merely for the sight , He wears all day , and draws those teeth at night .</p>
    <p n="353">131 . THE CUSTARD .</p>
    <p n="354">For second course , last night , a custard came To th ’ board , so hot as none could touch the same : Furze three or four times with his cheeks did blow Upon the custard , and thus cooled so ; It seem 'd by this time to admit the touch , But none could eat it , ‘ cause it stunk so much .</p>
    <p n="355">135 . UPON GRYLL .</p>
    <p n="356">Gryll eats , but ne'er says grace ; to speak the truth , Gryll either keeps his breath to cool his broth , Or else , because Gryll 's roast does burn his spit , Gryll will not therefore say a grace for it .</p>
    <p n="357">148 . UPON STRUT .</p>
    <p n="358">Strut , once a foreman of a shop we knew ; But turn 'd a ladies ’ usher now , ‘ tis true : Tell me , has Strut got e 're a title more ? No ; he 's but foreman , as he was before .</p>
    <p n="359">163 . UPON JOLLY 'S WIFE .</p>
    <p n="360">First , Jolly 's wife is lame ; then next loose-hipp 'd : Squint-ey 'd , hook-nos 'd ; and lastly , kidney-lipp 'd .</p>
    <p n="361">171 . UPON PAGGET .</p>
    <p n="362">Pagget , a schoolboy , got a sword , and then He vow 'd destruction both to birch and men : Who would not think this younker fierce to fight ? Yet coming home , but somewhat late ( last night ) , Untruss , his master bade him ; and that word Made him take up his shirt , lay down his sword .</p>
    <p n="363">183 . UPON PRIG .</p>
    <p n="364">Prig now drinks water , who before drank beer ; What 's now the cause ? we know the case is clear ; Look in Prig 's purse , the chev'ril there tells you Prig money wants , either to buy or brew .</p>
    <p n="365">Chevril , kid .</p>
    <p n="366">184 . UPON BATT .</p>
    <p n="367">Batt he gets children , not for love to rear ‘ em ; But out of hope his wife might die to bear ‘ em .</p>
    <p n="368">188 . UPON MUCH-MORE . EPIG .</p>
    <p n="369">Much-more provides and hoards up like an ant , Yet Much-more still complains he is in want . Let Much-more justly pay his tithes ; then try How both his meal and oil will multiply .</p>
    <p n="370">199 . UPON LUGGS . EPIG .</p>
    <p n="371">Luggs , by the condemnation of the Bench , Was lately whipt for lying with a wench . Thus pains and pleasures turn by turn succeed : He smarts at last who does not first take heed .</p>
    <p n="372">200 . UPON GUBBS . EPIG .</p>

    <p n="375">Money thou ow'st me ; prethee fix a day For payment promis 'd , though thou never pay : Let it be Dooms-day ; nay , take longer scope ; Pay when th'art honest ; let me have some hope .</p>
    <p n="376">221 . GREAT BOAST SMALL ROAST .</p>
    <p n="377">Of flanks and chines of beef doth Gorrell boast He has at home ; but who tastes boil 'd or roast ? Look in his brine-tub , and you shall find there Two stiff blue pigs ’ - feet and a sow 's cleft ear .</p>
    <p n="378">222 . UPON A BLEAR-EY 'D WOMAN .</p>
    <p n="379">Wither 'd with years , and bed-rid Mumma lies ; Dry-roasted all , but raw yet in her eyes .</p>
    <p n="380">233 . NO LOCK AGAINST LETCHERY .</p>
    <p n="381">Bar close as you can , and bolt fast too your door , To keep out the letcher , and keep in the whore ; Yet quickly you 'll see by the turn of a pin , The whore to come out , or the letcher come in .</p>

    <p n="590">836 . UPON BLINKS . EPIG .</p>
    <p n="591">Tom Blinks his nose is full of weals , and these Tom calls not pimples , but pimpleides ; Sometimes , in mirth , he says each whelk 's a spark , When drunk with beer , to light him home i ’ th ’ dark .</p>
    <p n="592">837 . UPON ADAM PEAPES . EPIG .</p>
    <p n="593">Peapes he does strut , and pick his teeth , as if His jaws had tir 'd on some large chine of beef . But nothing so : the dinner Adam had , Was cheese full ripe with tears , with bread as sad .</p>

    <p n="595">844 . HANCH , A SCHOOLMASTER . EPIG .</p>
    <p n="596">Hanch , since he lately did inter his wife , He weeps and sighs , as weary of his life . Say , is't for real grief he mourns ? not so ; Tears have their springs from joy , as well as woe .</p>
    <p n="597">845 . UPON PEASON . EPIG .</p>
    <p n="598">Long locks of late our zealot Peason wears , Not for to hide his high and mighty ears ; No , but because he would not have it seen That stubble stands where once large ears have been .</p>
    <p n="599">880 . KISSES LOATHSOME .</p>
    <p n="600">I abhor the slimy kiss , Which to me most loathsome is . Those lips please me which are placed Close , but not too strictly laced : Yielding I would have them ; yet Not a wimbling tongue admit : What should poking-sticks make there , When the ruffe is set elswhere ?</p>
    <p n="601">881 . UPON REAPE .</p>
    <p n="602">Reape 's eyes so raw are that , it seems , the flies Mistake the flesh , and fly-blow both his eyes ; So that an angler , for a day 's expense , May bait his hook with maggots taken thence .</p>

    <p n="638">988 . UPON FAUNUS .</p>
    <p n="639">We read how Faunus , he the shepherds ’ god , His wife to death whipped with a myrtle rod . The rod , perhaps , was better 'd by the name ; But had it been of birch , the death 's the same .</p>

In 1608 there was issued a proclamation containing “ Orders conceived by the Lords of his Maiestie 's Privie Counsell and by his Highnesse speciall direction , commanded to be put in execution for the restraint of killing and eating of flesh the next Lent ” . This was re-issued ten years later ( there is no intermediate issue at the British Museum ) , and from 1619 onwards became annual under James and Charles in the form of “ A proclamation for restraint of killing , dressing , and eating of Flesh in Lent , or on Fish dayes , appointed by the Law , to be hereafter strictly observed by all sorts of people ” .</p>

He was appointed gardener to Charles II . in 1629 , and he and his son naturalised many rare plants in England . Besides botanical specimens he collected all sorts of curiosities , and opened a museum which he called “ Tradescant 's Ark ” . In 1656 , four years after his death , his son published a catalogue of the collection under the title , “ Museum Tradescantianum : or , a collection of rarities preserved at South Lambeth , near London , by John Tradescant ” .

    <p n="698">The Portrait of a Woman : I subjoin here the four passages found in manuscript versions of this poem , alluded to in the previous note . As said before , they do not improve the poem . After l. 45 , “ Bearing aloft this rich round world of wonder , ” we have these four lines :</p>
    <p n="699">In which the veins implanted seem to lie Like loving vines hid under ivory , So full of claret , that whoso pricks this vine May see it spout forth streams like muscadine .</p>
    <p n="700">Twelve lines later , after “ Riphean snow , ” comes a longer passage :</p>
    <p n="701">Or else that she in that white waxen hill Hath seal 'd the primrose of her utmost skill . But now my muse hath spied a dark descent From this so precious , pearly , permanent , A milky highway that direction yields Unto the port-mouth of the Elysian fields : A place desired of all , but got by these Whom love admits to the Hesperides ; Here 's golden fruit , that doth exceed all price , Growing in this love-guarded paradise ; Above the entrance there is written this : This is the portal to the bower of bliss , Through midst whereof a crystal stream there flows Passing the sweet sweet of a musky rose . With plump , soft flesh , of metal pure and fine , Resembling shields , both pure and crystalline . Hence rise those two ambitious hills that look Into th ’ middle , sweet , sight-stealing crook , Which for the better beautifying shrouds Its humble self ‘ twixt two aspiring clouds</p>
    <p n="702">The third addition is four lines from the end , after “ with a pearly shell ":</p>
    <p n="703">Richer than that fair , precious , virtuous horn That arms the forehead of the unicorn .</p>
    <p n="704">The last four lines are joined on at the end of all :</p>
    <p n="705">Unto the idol of the work divine I consecrate this loving life of mine , Bowing my lips unto that stately root Where beauty springs ; and thus I kiss her foot .</p>
