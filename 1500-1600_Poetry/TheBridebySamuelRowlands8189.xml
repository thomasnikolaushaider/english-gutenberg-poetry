    <docImprint>Editorial note : Long s 's have been turned into s 's , and the occasional use of a macron over a vowel to express a following n or m has been replaced with the following n or m. Otherwise , the spelling is as in the original edition of<date>1617</date>, as difficult and inconsistent as it may be .</docImprint>
    <docTitle><titlePart>THE BRIDE By Samuel Rowlands With an Introductory Note by Alfred Claghorn Potter Introductory Note When the complete works of Samuel Rowlands were issued by the Hunterian Club in 1872-1880 , in an edition of two hundred and ten copies , the Editor was obliged to omit from the collection the poem entitled “ The Bride . ” No copy of this tract was supposed to be extant . Twenty years later , in the article on Rowlands in the Dictionary of National Biography , Mr. Sidney Lee also names this poem as one of the author 's lost works . All that was known of it was the entry in the Stationers ’ Register : [ Footnote : Arber 's Transcript , vol . iii . p . 609 . ]</titlePart></docTitle>
    <docImprint>“ 22 [ degrees ] Maij<date>1617</date>“ Master Pauier . Entred for his Copie vnder the handes of master TAUERNOR and both the wardens , A Poeme intituled The Bride , written by SAMUELL ROWLANDE vj 'd . ” While all of Rowlands 's works are classed by bibliographers as “ rare , ” this one seemed to have disappeared entirely . No copy was to be found in any of the large libraries or private collections , nor was there any record of its sale . Last spring a copy was discovered in the catalogue of a bookseller in a small German town , and was secured for the Harvard College Library , being purchased from the Child Memorial Fund . The copy is perfect , except that the inner corner at the top of the second and third leaves has been torn off , with the loss of parts of two words , which have been supplied in manuscript . From this copy the present reprint is made . As in the Hunterian Club edition of Rowlands 's Works , to which this may be considered a supplement , the reprint is exact . The general makeup of the book as to style and size of type has been followed as closely as possible ; and the text has been reproduced page for page and word for word . The misprints , which are unusually numerous , even for a book of this period , have been left uncorrected . The title-page and the two head-pieces have been reproduced by photography . Of the poem itself , since it is now before the reader , little need be said . It cannot be claimed that it presents great poetical merit . Rowlands at his best was but an indifferent poet ,— hardly more than a penny-a-liner . In his satirical pieces and epigrams , and in that bit of genuine comedy , “ Tis Merrie vvhen Gossips meete , ” his work does have a real literary value , and is distinctly interesting as presenting a vivid picture of<settlement>London</settlement>life at the beginning of the seventeenth century . In “ The Bride , ” it must be confessed , Rowlands falls below his own best work . Yet the poem is by no means wholly lacking in interest . If not his best work , “ The Bride ” is by no means his worst . Like most of his poems , it is written in an heroic stanza of six lines , and , as is not so common with him , is in dialogue form . The dialogue for the most part is well sustained and sprightly . The story of the birth of Merlin , it is true , seems to have been inserted mainly to fill out the required number of pages ; but this digression has an interest of its own , in that the name here given to Merlin 's mother , “ Lady Adhan , ” does not appear in the ordinary versions of the legend . Of Rowlands 's life almost nothing is known : that little is told in the Memoir by Mr. Gosse prefixed to the Hunterian Club edition , and by Mr. Lee in the Dictionary of National Biography , and need not be repeated here . All that is known with certainty is that Samuel Rowlands was a writer of numerous poems and pamphlets , published between the years<date>1598</date>and<date>1628</date>. During this period there appeared almost every year a pamphlet bearing his name or the well known initials , “ S. R . ” Twenty-eight separate works , of which many passed through several editions , are known to have been written by him . All of these early editions are rare ; at least two of the works have been lost ; several are extant only in the second or later editions ; and of at least ten , only single copies are known to exist . Beside the edition of the Works already referred to , a number of Rowlands 's tracts have been separately reprinted , in limited editions , by Sir Walter Scott , by S. W. Singer , by E. V. Utterson , by Halliwell-Phillipps , by J. P. Collier , and by E. F. Rimbault in the publications of the Percy Society ; to this series of reprints , “ The Bride ” is now added .
