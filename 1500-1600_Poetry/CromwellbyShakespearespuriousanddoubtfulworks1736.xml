   <p>HODGE . Come , masters , I think it be past five a clock ; is it not time we were at work : my old Master he 'll be stirring anon .</p>
   <p>FIRST SMITH . I cannot tell whether my old master will be stirring or no : but I am sure I can hardly take my afternoon 's nap , for my young Master Thomas , he keeps such a quile in his study , with the Sun , and the Moon , and the seven stars , that I do verily think he 'll read out his wife .</p>
   <p>HODGE . He skill of the stars ! there 's good-man Car of Fulhum , he that carried us to the strong Ale , where goody Trundell had her maid got with child : O he knows the stars . He 'll tickle you Charles Waine in nine degrees . That same man will tell you goody Trundell when her Ale shall miscarry , only by the stars .</p>
   <p>SECOND SMITH . Aye , that 's a great virtue ; indeed I think Thomas be no body in comparison to him .</p>
   <p>FIRST SMITH . Well , masters , come , shall we to our hammers ?</p>
   <p>HODGE . Aye , content ; first let 's take our morning 's draught , and then to work roundly .</p>

   <p>ACT I . SCENE II . The same .</p>
   <note>Enter young Cromwell .</note>
   <p>CROMWELL . Good morrow , morn , I do salute thy brightness . The night seems tedious to my troubled soul , Whose black obscurity binds in my mind A thousand sundry cogitations : And now Aurora , with a lively dye , Adds comfort to my spirit that mounts on high — Too high indeed , my state being so mean . My study , like a mineral of gold , Makes my heart proud , wherein my hopes enrolled ; My books is all the wealth I do possess .</p>
   <note>Here within they must beat with their hammers .</note>

   <p>HODGE . Why , how now , Master Thomas , how now ? Will you not let us work for you ?</p>
   <p>CROMWELL . You fret my heart , with making of this noise .</p>
   <p>HODGE . How , fret your heart ? Aye , but Thomas , you 'll fret your father 's purse if you let us from working .</p>
   <p>SECOND SMITH . Aye , this tis for him to make him a gentleman . Shall we leave work for your musing ? that 's well , I faith ; But here comes my old master now .</p>
   <note>Enter Old Cromwell .</note>
   <p>OLD CROMWELL . You idle knaves , what , are you loitering now ? No hammers walking and my work to do ! What , not a heat among your work to day ?</p>
   <p>HODGE . Marry , sir , your son Thomas will not let us work at all .</p>
   <p>OLD CROMWELL . Why , knave , I say , have I thus carked &amp; car 'd And all to keep thee like a gentleman ; And dost thou let my servants at their work , That sweat for thee , knave , labour thus for thee ?</p>
   <p>CROMWELL . Father , their hammers do offend my study .</p>
   <p>OLD CROMWELL . Out of my doors , knave , if thou likest it not . I cry you mercy ! is your ears so fine ? I tell thee , knave , these get when I do sleep ; I will not have my Anvil stand for thee .</p>
   <p>CROMWELL . There 's money , father , I will pay your men .</p>
   <note>He throws money among them .</note>
   <p>OLD CROMWELL . Have I thus brought thee up unto my cost , In hope that one day thou wouldst relieve my age , And art thou now so lavish of thy coin , To scatter it among these idle knaves .</p>
   <p>CROMWELL . Father , be patient , and content your self . The time will come I shall hold gold as trash : And here I speak with a presaging soul , To build a palace where now this cottage stands , As fine as is King Henry 's house at Sheene .</p>
   <p>OLD CROMWELL . You build a house ! you knave , you 'll be a beggar . Now , afore God , all is but cast away , That is bestowed upon this thriftless lad . Well , had I bound him to some honest trade , This had not been , but it was his mother 's doing , To send him to the University . How ? build a house where now this cottage stands , As fair as that at Sheene !— [ Aside . ] He shall not hear me . A good boy Tom ! I con thee thank Tom ! Well said Tom ! gramarcies Tom !— Into your work , knaves ; hence , you saucy boy .</p>
   <note>Exit all but young Cromwell .</note>
   <p>CROMWELL . Why should my birth keep down my mounting spirit ? Are not all creatures subject unto time : To time , who doth abuse the world , And fills it full of hodge-podge bastardy ? There 's legions now of beggars on the earth , That their original did spring from Kings : And many Monarchs now whose fathers were The riffe-raffe of their age : for Time and Fortune Wears out a noble train to beggary , And from the hunghill minions do advance To state and mark in this admiring world . This is but course , which in the name of Fate Is seen as often as it whirls about : The River Thames , that by our door doth pass , His first beginning is but small and shallow : Yet keeping on his course , grows to a sea . And likewise Wolsey , the wonder of our age , His birth as mean as mine , a Butcher 's son , Now who within this land a greater man ? Then , Cromwell , cheer thee up , and tell thy soul , That thou maist live to flourish and control .</p>

   <p>BAGOT . I hope this day is fatal unto some , And by their loss must Bagot seek to gain . This is the lodging of master Friskiball , A liberal Merchant , and a Florentine , To whom Banister owes a thousand pound , A Merchant Banckrout , whose Father was my master . What do I care for pity or regard ? He once was wealthy , but he now is fallen , And this morning have I got him arrested , At the suit of master Friskiball , And by this means shall I be sure of coin , For doing this same good to him unknown : And in good time , see where the merchant comes .</p>
   <note>Enter Friskiball .</note>
   <p>BAGOT . Good morrow to kind master Friskiball .</p>
   <p>FRISKIBALL . Good morrow to your self , good master Bagot , And what 's the news , you are so early stirring : It is for gain , I make no doubt of that .</p>
   <p>BAGOT . It is for the love , sir , that I bear to you . When did you see your debtor Banister ?</p>
   <p>FRISKIBALL . I promise you , I have not seen the man This two months day ; his poverty is such , As I do think he shames to see his friends .</p>
   <p>BAGOT . Why , then , assure your self to see him straight , For at your suit I have arrested him , And here they will be with him presently .</p>
   <p>FRISKIBALL . Arrest him at my suit ? you were to blame . I know the man 's misfortune to be such , As he 's not able for to pay the debt , And were it known to some he were undone .</p>
   <p>BAGOT . This is your pitiful heart to think it so , But you are much deceived in Banister . Why such as he will break for fashion sake , And unto those they owe a thousand pound , Pay scarce a hundred . O , sir , beware of him . The man is lewdly given to Dice and Drabs , Spends all he hath in harlots ’ companies ; It is no mercy for to pity him . I speak the truth of him , for nothing else , But for the kindness that I bear to you .</p>
   <p>FRISKIBALL . If it be so , he hath deceived me much , And to deal strictly with such a one as he — Better severe than too much lenity . But here is Master Banister himself , And with him , as I take , the officers .</p>
   <note>Enter Banister , his wife , and two officers .</note>
   <p>BANISTER . O master Friskiball , you have undone me . My state was well nigh overthrown before , Now altogether down-cast by your means .</p>
   <p>MISTRESS BANISTER . O master Friskiball , pity my husband 's case . he is a man hath lived as well as any , Till envious fortune and the ravenous sea Did rob , disrobe , and spoil us of our own .</p>
   <p>FRISKIBALL . Mistress Banister , I envy not your husband , Nor willingly would I have used him thus , But that I hear he is so lewdly given , Haunts wicked company , and hath enough To pay his debts , yet will not be known thereof .</p>
   <p>BANISTER . This is that damned Broker , that same Bagot , Whom I have often from my Frencher fed . Ingrateful Villain for to use me thus !</p>
   <p>BAGOT . What I have said to him is naught but truth .</p>
   <p>MISTRESS BANISTER . What thou hast said springs from an envious heart . A Cannibal that doth eat men alive ! But here upon my knee , believe me , sir , And what I speak , so help me God , is true : We scarce have meat to feed our little babes . Most of our Plate is in that Broker 's hand , Which , had we money to defray our debt , O think ,. we would not bide that penury . Be merciful , kind master Friskiball . My husband , children , and my self will eat But one meal a day , the other will We keep and sell As part to pay the debt we owe to you : If ever tears did pierce a tender mind , Be pitiful , let me some favour find .</p>
   <p>BAGOT . Be not you so mad , sir , to believe her tears .</p>
   <p>FRISKIBALL . Go to , I see thou art an envious man . Good mistress Banister , kneel not to me ; I pray rise up , you shall have your desire . Hold ; officers , be gone , there 's for your pains .— You know you owe to me a thousand pound : Here , take my hand ; if ear God make you able , And place you in your former state again , Pay me : but if still your fortune frown , Upon my faith I 'll never ask you crown : I never yet did wrong to men in thrall , For God doth know what to my self may fall .</p>
   <p>BANISTER . This unexpected favour , undeserved , Doth make my heart bleed inwardly with joy . Ne'er may ought prosper with me is my own , If I forget this kindness you have shown .</p>
   <p>MISTRESS BANISTER . My children in their prayers , both night and day , For your good fortune and success shall pray .</p>
   <p>FRISKIBALL . I thank you both ; I pray , do dine with me . Within these three days , if God give me leave , I will to Florence , to my native home . Bagot , hold ; there 's a Portague to drink , Although you ill deserved it by your merit . Give not such cruel scope unto your heart ; Be sure the ill you do will be requited . Remember what I say , Bagot ; farewell . Come , Master Banister ; you shall with me . My fare is but simple , but welcome heartily .</p>
   <note>Exit all but Bagot .</note>
   <p>BAGOT . A plague go with you ; would you had eat your last ! Is this the thanks I have for all my pains ? Confusion light upon you all for me . Where he had wont to give a score of crowns , Doth he now foist me with a Portague ? Well , I will be revenged upon this Banister . I 'll to his creditors , buy all the debts he owes , As seeming that I do it for good will . I am sure to have them at an easy rate , And when tis done , in christendom he stays not , But I 'll make his heart to ache with sorrow : And if that Banister become my debtor , By heaven and earth I 'll make his plague the greater .</p>

What doth fall out , with patience sit and see , A just requital of false treachery .</p>

   <p>CROMWELL . Thus far my reckoning doth go straight &amp; even , But , Cromwell , this same ployding fits not thee : Thy mind is altogether set on travel , And not to live thus cloistered like a Nun . It is not this same trash that i regard , Experience is the jewel of my heart .</p>

   <p>What gentlewoman is this that grieves so much ? It seems she doth address her self to me .</p>
   <p>MISTRESS BANISTER . God save you , sir , sir ; pray , is your name master Cromwell ?</p>
   <p>CROMWELL . My name is Thomas Cromwell , gentlewoman .</p>
   <p>MISTRESS BANISTER . Know you not one Bagot , sir , that 's come to Antwerp ?</p>
   <p>CROMWELL . No , trust me , I never saw the man , But here are bills of debt I have received , Against one Banister , a Merchant fallen into decay .</p>
   <p>MISTRESS BANISTER . Into decay , indeed , long of that wretch . I am the wife to woeful Banister : And by that bloody villain am pursued From London here to Antwerp . My husband he is in the governour 's hands , And God no doubt will treble bless your gain .</p>
   <p>CROMWELL . Good mistress Banister , what I can , I will , In any thing that lies within my power .</p>
   <p>MISTRESS BANISTER . O speak to Bagot , that same wicked wretch , An Angel 's voice may move a damned devil .</p>
   <p>CROMWELL . Why , is he come to Antwerp , as you here ?</p>
   <p>MISTRESS BANISTER . I heard he landed some two hours since .</p>
   <p>CROMWELL . Well , mistress Banister , assure your self . I 'll speak to Bagot in your own behalf , And win him to all the pity that I can . Mean time , to comfort you in your distress , Receive these Angels to relieve your need , And be assured that what I can effect To do you good , no way I will neglect .</p>
   <p>MISTRESS BANISTER . That mighty God , that knows each mortal 's heart , Keep you from trouble , sorrow , grief , and smart .</p>
   <note>Exit Mistress Banister .</note>
   <p>CROMWELL . Thanks , courteous woman , for thy hearty prayer . It grieves my soul to see her misery , But we that live under the work of fate , May hope the best , yet knows not to what state Our stars and destinies hath us assigned . Fickle is fortune and her face is blind .</p>

   <p>ACT II . SCENE II . A street in Antwerp .</p>
   <note>Enter Bagot solus .</note>
   <p>BAGOT . So all goes well ; it is as I would have it . Banister he is with the Governour And shortly shall have guives upon his heels . It glads my heart to think upon the slave ; I hope to have his body rot in prison , And after here his wife to hang her self , And all his children die for want of food . The Jewels that I have brought to Antwerp Are recond to be worth five thousand pound , Which scarcely stood me in three hundreth pound . I bought them at an easy kind of rate ; I care not which way they came by them That sold them me , it comes not near my heart : And least thy should be stolen — as sure they are — I thought it meet to sell them here in Antwerp , And so have left them in the Governour 's hand , Who offers me within two hundreth pound Of all my price . But now no more of that : I must go see and if my bills be safe , The which I sent to master Cromwell , That if the wind should keep me on the sea , He might arrest him here before I came :</p>
   <note>Enter Cromwell .</note>
   <p>And in good time , see where he is . God save you sir .</p>
   <p>CROMWELL . And you : pray pardon me , I know you not .</p>
   <p>BAGOT . It may be so , sir , but my name is Bagot , The man that sent to you the bills of debt .</p>
   <p>CROMWELL . O , the man that pursues Banister . Here are the bills of debt you sent to me : As for the man , you know best where he is . It is reported you have a flinty heart , A mind that will not stoop to any pity , An eye that knows not how to shed a tear , A hand that 's always open for reward ; But , master Bagot , would you be ruled by me , You should turn all these to the contrary . Your heart should still have feeling of remorse , Your mind according to your state be liberal To those that stand in need and in distress ; Your hand to help them that do stand in want , Rather than with your poise to hold them down ; For every ill turn show your self more kind ; Thus should I do ; pardon , I speak my mind .</p>
   <p>BAGOT . Aye , sir , you speak to hear what I would say , But you must live , I know , as well as I : I know this place to be extortion , And tis not for a man to keep him , But he must lie , cog with his dearest friend , And as for pity , scorn it , hate all conscience . But yet I do commend your wit in this , To make a show of what I hope you are not ; But I commend you and tis well done : This is the only way to bring your gain .</p>
   <p>CROMWELL . My gain ! I had rather chain me to an oar , And like a slave there toil out all my life , Before I 'd live so base a slave as thou : I , like an hypocrite , to make a show Of seeming virtue and a devil within ! No , Bagot , would thy conscience were as clear : Poor Banister ne'er had been troubled here .</p>
   <p>BAGOT . Nay , good master Cromwell ; be not angry , sir . I know full well you are no such man ; But if your conscience were as white as Snow , It will be thought that you are other wise .</p>
   <p>CROMWELL . Will it be thought that I am other wise ? Let them that think so know they are deceived . Shall Cromwell live to have his faith misconstered ? Antwerp , for all the wealth within thy Town , I will not stay here not two hours longer . As good luck serves , my accounts are all made even ; Therefore I 'll straight unto the treasurer . Bagot , I know you 'll to the governour ; Commend me to him , say I am bound to travail , To see the fruitful parts of Italy , And as you ever bore a Christian mind , Let Banister some favour of you find .</p>
   <p>BAGOT . For your sake , sir , I 'll help him all I can — [ Aside . ] To starve his heart out ere he get a groat . So , master Cromwell , do I take my leave , For I must straight unto the governour .</p>
   <note>Exit Bagot .</note>
   <p>CROMWELL . Farewell , sir ; pray you remember what I said .— No , Cromwell , no ; thy heart was ne'er so base , To live by falsehood or by brokery ! But ‘ t falles out well , I little it repent ; Hereafter , time in travel shall be spent .</p>
   <note>Enter Hodge , his father 's man .</note>
   <p>HODGE . Your son Thomas , quoth you : I have been Thomast ! I had thought it had been no such matter to a gone by water : for at Putney I 'll go you to Parish-garden for two pence , sit as still as may be , without any wagging or jolting in my guts , in a little boat too : here we were scarce four mile in the great green water , but I — thinking to go to my afternoon 's urgings , as twas my manner at home — but I felt a kind of rising in my guts . At last one a the Sailors spying of me , be a good cheer , says he , set down thy victuals , and up with it , thou hast nothing but an Eel in thy belly . Well toot went I , to my victuals went the Sailors , and thinking me to be a man of better experience than any in the ship , asked me what Wood the ship was made of : they all swore I told them as right as if I had been acquainted with the Carpenter that made it . At last we grew near land , and I grew villainous hungry , went to my bag : the devil a bit there was . The Sailors had tickled me ; yet I cannot blame them : it was a part of kindness , for I in kindness told them what Wood the ship was made of , and they in kindness eat up my victuals , as indeed one good turn asketh another . Well , would I could find my master Thomas in this Dutch Town ; he might put some English Beer into my belly .</p>
   <p>CROMWELL . What , Hodge , my father 's man ? by my hand , welcome ! How doth my father ? what 's the news at home ?</p>
   <p>HODGE . Master Thomas , O God , master Thomas , your hand , glove and all . This is to give you to understanding that your father is in health , and Alice Downing here hath sent you a Nutmeg , &amp; Bess Makewater a race of Ginger ; my fellow Will &amp; Tom hath between them sent you a dozen of points , &amp; good man Tolle of the Goat a pair of mittens ; my self came in person : and this is all the news .</p>
   <p>CROMWELL . Gramarcy , good Hodge , and thou art welcome to me , But in as ill a time thou comest as may be : For I am travelling into Italy . What sayest thou , Hodge ? wilt thou bear me company ?</p>
   <p>HODGE . Will I bear thee company , Tom ? What tell'st me of Italy ? were it to the furthest part of Flanders , I would go with thee , Tom . I am thine in all weal and woe , thy own to command . What , Tom ! I have passed the rigorous waves of Neptune 's blasts ; I tell you , Thomas , I have been in the danger of the floods ; and when I have seen Boreas begin to play the Ruffin with us , then would I down of my knees and call upon Vulcan .</p>
   <p>CROMWELL . And why upon him ?</p>
   <p>HODGE . Because , as this same fellow Neptune is God of the Seas , so Vulcan is Lord over the Smiths , and therefore , I , being a Smith , thought his Godhead would have some care yet of me .</p>
   <p>CROMWELL . A good conceit , but tell me , hast thou dined yet ?</p>
   <p>HODGE . Thomas , to speak the truth , not a bit yet I .</p>
   <p>CROMWELL . Come , go with me ; thou shalt have cheer good store . And farewell , Antwerp , if I come no more .</p>
   <p>HODGE . I follow thee , sweet Tom , I follow thee .</p>

   <p>ACT II . SCENE III . Another street in the same .</p>
   <note>Enter the Governour of the English house , Bagot , Banister , his wife , and two officers .</note>
   <p>GOVERNOUR . Is Cromwell gone then , say you , master Bagot ? What dislike , I pray ? what was the cause ?</p>
   <p>BAGOT . To tell you true , a wild brain of his own ; Such youth as they cannot see when they are well : He is all bent to travail , that 's his reason , And doth not love to eat his bread at home .</p>
   <p>GOVERNOUR . Well , good fortune with him , if the man be gone . We hardly shall find such a one as he , To fit our turns ; his dealings were so honest . But now , sir , for your Jewels that I have , What do you say ? will you take my prise ?</p>
   <p>BAGOT . O , sir , you offer too much underfoot .</p>
   <p>GOVERNOUR . Tis but two hundred pound between us , man . What 's that in payment of five thousand pound ?</p>
   <p>BAGOT . Two hundred pound ! birlady , sir , tis great : Before I got so much , it made me sweat .</p>
   <p>GOVERNOUR . Well , Master Bagot , I 'll profer you fairly . You see this Merchant , master Banister , Is going now to prison at your suit . His substance all is gone ; what would you have ? Yet in regard I knew the man of wealth — Never dishonest dealing , but such mishaps Hath fallen on him , may light on me or you — There is two hundred pound between us ; We will divide the same : I 'll give you one , On that condition you will set him free : His state is nothing , that you see your self , And where naught is , the King must lose his right .</p>
   <p>BAGOT . Sir , sir , you speak out of your love , Tis foolish love , sir , sure , to pity him : Therefore , content your self ; this is my mind : To do him good I will not bate a penny .</p>
   <p>BANISTER . This is my comfort : though thou doost no good , A mighty ebb follows a mighty flood .</p>
   <p>MISTRESS BANISTER . O thou base wretch , whom we have fostered Even as a Serpent for to poison us , If God did ever right a woman 's wrong , To that same God I bend and bow my heart , To let his heavy wrath fall on thy head , By whom my hopes and joys are butchered .</p>
   <p>BAGOT . Alas , fond woman , I pray thee , pray thy worst ; The Fox fares better still when he is curst .</p>
   <note>Enter Master Bowser , a Merchant .</note>
   <p>GOVERNOUR . Master Bowser ! you 're welcome , sir , from England . What 's the best news ? how doth all our friends ?</p>
   <p>BOWSER . They are all well and do commend them to you : There 's letters from your brother and your son : So fair you well , sir ; I must take my leave . My haste and business doth require such .</p>
   <p>GOVERNOUR . Before you dine , sir ? What , go you out of town ?</p>
   <p>BOWSER . Aye , faith , unless I hear some news in town , I must away ; there is no remedy .</p>
   <p>GOVERNOUR . Master Bowser , what is your business ? may I know it ?</p>
   <p>BOWSER . You may , sir , and so shall all the City . The King of late hath had his treasury robbed , And of the choicest jewels that he had : The value of them was some seven thousand pound . The fellow that did steal these jewels , he is hanged , And did confess that for three hundred pound He sold them to one Bagot dwelling in London : Now Bagot 's fled , and , as we hear , to Antwerp , And hither am I come to seek him out ; And they that first can tell me of his news Shall have a hundred pound for their reward .</p>
   <p>BANISTER . How just is God to right the innocent .</p>
   <p>GOVERNOUR . Master Bowser , you come in happy time : Here is the villain Bagot that you seek , And all those jewels have I in my hands . Officers , look to him , hold him fast .</p>
   <p>BAGOT . The devil ought me a shame , and now hath paid it .</p>
   <p>BOWSER . Is this that Bagot ? fellows , bear him hence . We will not now stand for his reply . Lade him with Irons ; we will have him tried In England , where his villainies are known .</p>
   <p>BAGOT . Mischief , confusion , light upon you all ! O hang me , drown me , let me kill my self ! Let go my arms ; let me run quick to hell .</p>
   <p>BOWSER . Away , bear him away ; stop the slave 's mouth .</p>
   <note>They carry him away .</note>
   <p>MISTRESS BANISTER . Thy works are infinite , great God of heaven .</p>
   <p>GOVERNOUR . I heard this Bagot was a wealthy fellow .</p>
   <p>BOWSER . He was indeed , for when his goods were seized , Of Jewels , coin , and Plate within his house , Was found the value of five thousand pound ; His furniture fully worth half so much , Which being all strained for , for the King , He frankly gave it to the Antwerp merchants , And they again , out of their bounteous mind , Hath to a brother of their company , A man decayed by fortune of the Seas , Given Bagot 's wealth , to set him up again , And keep it for him : his name is Banister .</p>
   <p>GOVERNOUR . Master Bowser , with this happy news You have revived two from the gates of death : This is that Banister , and this his wife .</p>
   <p>BOWSER . Sir , I am glad my fortune is so good , To bring such tidings as may comfort you .</p>
   <p>BANISTER . You have given life unto a man deemed dead , For by these news , my life is newly bred .</p>
   <p>MISTRESS BANISTER . Thanks to my God , next to my Sovereign King , And last to you that these good hopes doth bring .</p>
   <p>GOVERNOUR . The hundred pound I must receive as due For finding Bagot , I freely give to you .</p>
   <p>BOWSER . And , Master Banister , if so you please , I 'll bear you company , when you cross the Seas .</p>
   <p>BANISTER . If it please you , sir ; my company is but mean . Stands with your liking , I 'll wait on you .</p>
   <p>GOVERNOUR . I am glad that all things do accord so well : Come , Master Bowser , let us in to dinner : And , Mistress Banister , be merry , woman ! Come , after sorrow now let 's cheer your spirit ; Knaves have their due , and you but what you merit .</p>
   <note>Exit omnes .</note>
   <p>ACT III . SCENE I . The principal bridge at Florence .</p>
   <note>Enter Cromwell and Hodge in their shirts , and without Hats .</note>
   <p>HODGE . Call ye this seeing of fashions ? Marry , would I had stayed at Putney still . O , Master Thomas , we are spoiled , we are gone .</p>
   <p>CROMWELL . Content thee , man , this is but fortune .</p>
   <p>HODGE . Fortune ; a plague of this Fortune makes me go wetshod ; the rogues would not leave me a shoe to my feet . For my hose , they scorned them with their heels ; but for my Doublet and Hat , O Lord , they embraced me , and unlaced me , and took away my clothes , and so disgraced me .</p>
   <p>CROMWELL . Well , Hodge , what remedy ? What shift shall we make now ?</p>
   <p>HODGE . Nay , I know not . For begging I am naught , for stealing worse : by my troth , I must even fall to my old trade , to the Hammer and the Horse heels again : but now the worst is , I am not acquainted with the humor of the horses in this country , whether they are not coltish , given much to kicking , or no ; for when I have one leg in my hand , if he should up and lay tother on my chops , I were gone : there lay I , there lay Hodge .</p>
   <p>CROMWELL . Hodge , I believe thou must work for us both .</p>
   <p>HODGE . O , Master Thomas , have not I told you of this ? have not I many a time and often said , Tom , or Master Thomas , learn to make a Horse-shoe , it will be your own another day : this was not regarded . Hark you , Thomas , what do you call the fellows that robbed us ?</p>
   <p>CROMWELL . The Bandetti .</p>
   <p>HODGE . The Bandetti , do you call them ? I know not what they are called here , but I am sure we call them plain thieves in England . O Thomas , that we were now at Putney , at the ale there .</p>
   <p>CROMWELL . Content thee , man ; here set up these two bills , And let us keep our standing on the bridge : The fashion of this country is such , If any stranger be oppressed with want , To write the manner of his misery , And such as are disposed to succour him , Will do it . What , hast thou set them up ?</p>
   <p>HODGE . Aye , they 're up ; God send some to read them , and not only to read them , but also to look on us ; and not altogether to look on us ,</p>
   <note>One stands at one end , and one at tother .</note>
   <p>But to relieve us . O cold , cold , cold .</p>
   <note>Enter Friskiball , the Merchant , and reads the bills .</note>
   <p>FRISKIBALL . What 's here ? two Englishmen robbed by the Bandetti ! One of them seems to be a gentleman . Tis pity that his fortune was so hard , To fall into the desperate hands of thieves . I 'll question him of what estate he is . God save you , sir ; are you an Englishman ?</p>
   <p>CROMWELL . I am , sir , a distress Englishman .</p>
   <p>FRISKIBALL . And what are you , my friend ?</p>
   <p>HODGE . Who ? I , sir ? by my troth , I do not know my self what I am now , but , sir , I was a smith , sir , a poor Farrier of Putney . That 's my master , sir , yonder . I was robbed for his sake , sir .</p>
   <p>FRISKIBALL . I see you have been met by the Bandetti , And therefore need not ask how you came thus . But , Friskiball , why doost thou question them Of their estate and not relieve their need ? Sir , the coin I have about me is not much : There 's sixteen Ducats for to clothe your selves , There 's sixteen more to buy your diet with , And there 's sixteen to pay for your horse hire : Tis all the wealth , you see , my purse possesses , But if you please for to enquire me out , You shall not want for ought that I can do . My name is Friskiball , a Florence Merchant , A man that always loved your nation .</p>
   <p>CROMWELL . This unexpected favour at your hands , Which God doth know if ever I shall requite it — Necessity makes me to take your bounty , And for your gold can yield you naught but thanks . Your charity hath helped me from despair ; Your name shall still be in my hearty prayer .</p>
   <p>FRISKIBALL . It is not worth such thanks . Come to my house ; Your want shall better be relieved then thus .</p>
   <p>CROMWELL . I pray , excuse me ; this shall well suffice To bear my charges to Bononia , Whereas a noble Earl is much distressed : An Englishman , Russell , the Earl of Bedford , Is by the French King sold unto his death : It may fall out , that I may do him good ; To save his life , I 'll hazard my heart blood . Therefore , kind sir , thanks for your liberal gift ; I must be gone to aide him ; there 's no shift .</p>
   <p>FRISKIBALL . I 'll be no hinderer to so good an act . Heaven prosper you in that you go about ! If Fortune bring you this way back again , Pray let me see you : so I take my leave ; All good a man can wish , I do bequeath .</p>
   <note>Exit Friskiball .</note>
   <p>CROMWELL . All good that God doth send light on your head ; There 's few such men within our climate bred . How say you now , Hodge ? is not this good fortune ?</p>
   <p>HODGE . How say you ? I 'll tell you what , master Thomas ; if all men be of this Gentleman 's mind , let 's keep our standings upon this Bridge : we shall get more here with begging in one day , than I shall with making Horseshoes in a whole year .</p>
   <p>CROMWELL . No Hodge , we must begone unto Bononia , There to relieve the noble Earl of Bedford : Where , if I fail not in my policy , I shall deceive their subtle treachery .</p>
   <p>HODGE . Nay , I 'll follow you . God bless us from the thieving Bandettoes again .</p>
   <note>Exit omnes .</note>
   <p>ACT III . SCENE II . A room in an hotel .</p>
   <note>Enter Bedford and his Host .</note>
   <p>BEDFORD . Am I betrayed ? was Bedford born to die By such base slaves in such a place as this ? Have I escaped so many times in France , So many battles have I over passed , And made the French stir when they heard my name ; And am I now betrayed unto my death ? Some of their hearts ’ blood first shall pay for it .</p>
   <p>HOST . They do desire , my Lord , to speak with you .</p>
   <p>BEDFORD . The traitors do desire to have my blood , But by my birth , my honour , and my name , By all my hopes , my life shall cost them dear . Open the door ; I 'll venture out upon them , And if I must die , then I 'll die with honour .</p>
   <p>HOST . Alas , my Lord , that is a desperate course ; They have begirt you round about the house ; Their meaning is to take you prisoner , And so to send your body unto France .</p>
   <p>BEDFORD . First shall the Ocean be as dry as sand , Before alive they send me unto France : I 'll have my body first bored like a Sieve , And die as Hector , gainst the Mirmidons , Ere France shall boast Bedford 's their prisoner . Treacherous France , that , gainst the law of arms , Hath here betrayed thy enemy to death . But be assured , my blood shall be revenged Upon the best lives that remains in France .—</p>
   <note>Enter a Servant .</note>
   <p>Stand back , or else thou run'st upon thy death .</p>
   <p>MESSENGER . Pardon , my Lord ; I come to tell your honour , That they have hired a Neopolitan , Who by his Oratory hath promised them , Without the shedding of one drop of blood , Into their hands safe to deliver you , And therefore craves none but himself may enter And a poor swain that attends on him .</p>
   <note>Exit servant .</note>
   <p>BEDFORD . A Neopolitan ? bid him come in . Were he as cunning in his Eloquence As Cicero , the famous man of Rome , His words would be as chaff against the wind . Sweet tongued Ulysses that made Ajax mad , Were he and his tongue in this speaker 's head , Alive he wins me not ; then , tis no conquest dead .</p>
   <note>Enter Cromwell like a Neopolitan , and Hodge with him .</note>
   <p>CROMWELL . Sir , are you the master of the house ?</p>
   <p>HOST . I am , sir .</p>
   <p>CROMWELL . By this same token you must leave this place , And leave none but the Earl and I together , And this my Peasant here to tend on us .</p>
   <p>HOST . With all my heart . God grant , you do some good .</p>
   <note>Exit Host . Cromwell shuts the door .</note>
   <p>BEDFORD . Now , sir , what 's you will with me ?</p>
   <p>CROMWELL . Intends your honour not to yield your self ?</p>
   <p>BEDFORD . No , good man goose , not while my sword doth last . Is this your eloquence for to persuade me ?</p>
   <p>CROMWELL . My Lord , my eloquence is for to save you . I am not , as you judge , a Neopolitan , But Cromwell , your servant , and an Englishman .</p>
   <p>BEDFORD . How ? Cromwell ? not my Farrier 's son ?</p>
   <p>CROMWELL . The same , sir , and am come to succour you .</p>
   <p>HODGE . Yes , faith , sir ; and I am Hodge , your poor Smith . Many a time and oft have I shoed your Dapper Gray .</p>
   <p>BEDFORD . And what avails it me that thou art here ?</p>
   <p>CROMWELL . It may avail , if you 'll be ruled by me . My Lord , you know the men of Mantua And these Bononians are at deadly strife , And they , my Lord , both love and honour you . Could you but get out of the Mantua port , Then were you safe despite of all their force .</p>
   <p>BEDFORD . Tut , man , thou talkest of things impossible . Dost thou not see that we are round beset ? How , then , is it possible we should escape ?</p>
   <p>CROMWELL . By force we cannot , but by policy . Put on the apparel here that Hodge doth wear , And give him yours — the States , they know you not , For , as I think , they never saw your face — And at a watch-word must I call them in , And will desire , that we safe may pass To Mantua , where I 'll say my business lies . How doth your Honor like of this devise ?</p>
   <p>BEDFORD . O wondrous good ! But wilt thou venter , Hodge ?</p>
   <p>HODGE . Will I ?— O noble Lord , I do accord , In anything I can , And do agree , to set thee free , Do fortune what she can .</p>
   <p>BEDFORD . Come , then , let 's change our apparel straight .</p>
   <p>CROMWELL . Go , Hodge ; make haste , least they chance to call .</p>
   <p>HODGE . I warrant you I 'll fit him with a suit .</p>
   <note>Exit Earl &amp; Hodge .</note>
   <p>CROMWELL . Heavens grant this policy doth take success , And that the Earl may safely scape away . And yet it grieves me for this simple wretch , For fear they should offer him violence : But of two evils , tis best to shun the greatest , And better is it that he lives in thrall , Than such a Noble Earl as he should fall . Their stubborn hearts , it may be , will relent , Since he is gone to whom their hate is bent .— My Lord , have you dispatched ?</p>
   <note>Enter Bedford like the Clown , and Hodge in his cloak and his Hat .</note>
   <p>BEDFORD . How doost thou like us , Cromwell ? is it well ?</p>
   <p>CROMWELL . O , my Lord , excellent : Hodge , how doost feel thy self ?</p>
   <p>HODGE . How do I feel my self ? why , as a Noble man should do . O , how I feel honor come creeping on ! My Nobility is wonderful melancholy : Is it not most Gentlemen like to be melancholy ?</p>
   <p>CROMWELL . Yes , Hodge ; now go sit down in his study , and take state upon thee .</p>
   <p>HODGE . I warrant you , my Lord ; let me alone to take state upon me : but hark you , my Lord , do you feel nothing bite about you ?</p>
   <p>BEDFORD . No , trust me , Hodge .</p>
   <p>HODGE . Aye , they know they want their pasture ; it 's a strange thing of this vermine , they dare not meddle with Nobility .</p>
   <p>CROMWELL . Go , take thy place , Hodge ; I 'll call them in .—</p>
   <note>Hodge sits in the study , and Cromwell calls in the States .</note>
   <p>All is done , enter and if you please .</p>
   <note>Enter the States and Officers , with Halberts .</note>
   <p>GOVERNOUR . What , have you won him ? will he yield himself ?</p>
   <p>CROMWELL . I have , a n't please you , and the quiet Earl Doth yield himself to be disposed by you .</p>
   <p>GOVERNOUR . Give him the money that we promised him ; So let him go , whether it please himself .</p>
   <p>CROMWELL . My business , sir , lies unto Mantua , Please you to give me safe conduct thether .</p>
   <p>GOVERNOUR . Go and conduct him to the Mantua Port , And see him safe delivered presently .</p>
   <note>Exit Cromwell and Bedford .</note>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Go draw the curtains , let us see the Earl .—</l>
     <l n="2">O , he is writing ; stand apart awhile .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>HODGE . Fellow William , I am not as I have been : I went from you a Smith , I write to you as a Lord . I am , at this present writing , among the Polonian Sasiges . I do commend my Lordship to Raphe &amp; to Roger , to Bridget &amp; to Doritie , &amp; so to all the youth of Putney .</p>
   <p>GOVERNOUR . Sure , these are the names of English Noblemen , Some of his special friends , to whom he writes : But stay , he doth address himself to sing .</p>
   <note>Here he sings a song .</note>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">My Lord , I am glad you are so frolic and so blithe :</l>
     <l n="2">Believe me , noble Lord , if you knew all ,</l>
     <l n="3">You 'd change your merry vein to sudden sorrow .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>HODGE . I change my merry vein ? no , thou Bononian , no . I am a Lord — and therefore let me go — And do defy thee and thy Sasigis ; Therefore stand off , and come not near my honor .</p>
   <p>GOVERNOUR . My Lord , this jesting cannot serve your turn .</p>
   <p>HODGE . Doost think , thou black Bononian beast , That I do flout , do gibe , or jest , No , no , thou Beer-pot , know that I , A noble Earl , a Lord pardie —</p>
   <note>A Trumpet sounds .</note>
   <p>GOVERNOUR . What means this Trumpet 's sound ?</p>
   <note>Enter a Messenger .</note>
   <p>CITIZEN . One come from the States of Mantua .</p>
   <p>GOVERNOUR . What would you with us ? speak , thou man of Mantua .</p>
   <p>MESSENGER . Men of Bononia , this my message is : To let you know the Noble Earl of Bedford Is safe within the town of Mantua , And wills you send the peasant that you have , Who hath deceived your expectation ; Or else the States of Mantua have vowed They will recall the truce that they have made , And not a man shall stir from forth your town , That shall return , unless you send him back .</p>
   <p>GOVERNOUR . O this misfortune , how it mads my heart ! The Neopolitan hath beguiled us all . Hence with this fool ! what shall we do with him , The Earl being gone ? a plague upon it all .</p>
   <p>HODGE . No , I 'll assure you , I am no Earl , but a smith , sir ; One Hodge , a smith at Putney , sir ; One that hath gulled you , that hath bored you , sir .</p>
   <p>GOVERNOUR . Away with him ! take hence the fool you came for .</p>
   <p>HODGE . Aye , sir , and I 'll leave the greater fool with you .</p>
   <p>MESSENGER . Farewell , Bononians . Come , friend , a long with me .</p>
   <p>HODGE . My friend , afore ; my Lordship will follow thee .</p>
   <note>Exit .</note>
   <p>GOVERNOUR . Well , Mantua , since by thee the Earl is lost , Within few days I hope to see thee crossed .</p>
   <note>Exit omnes .</note>
   <note>Enter Chorus .</note>
   <p>CHORUS . Thus far you see how Cromwell 's fortune passed . The Earl of Bedford , being safe in Mantua , Desires Cromwell 's company into France , To make requital for his courtesy : But Cromwell doth deny the Earl his suit , And tells him that those parts he meant to see , he had not yet set footing on the land , And so directly takes his way to Spain : The Earl to France , and so they both do part . Now let your thoughts , as swift as is the wind , Skip some few years , that Cromwell spent in travel , And now imagine him to be in England , Servant unto the master of the Rules , Where in short time he there began to flourish . An hour shall show you what few years did cherish .</p>

But all my care , Cromwell , depends on thee . Thou art a man differing from vulgar form , And by how much thy spirit is ranked bove these In rules of Art , by so much it shines brighter By travel whose observance pleads his merit , In a most learned , yet unaffecting spirit , Good Cromwell , cast an eye of fair regard Bout all my house , and what this ruder flesh , Through ignorance , or wine , do miscreate , Salve thou with courtesy : if welcome want , Full bowls and ample banquets will seem scant .</p>

   <p>MORE . I love health well , but when as healths do bring Pain to the head and bodies sufeiting , Then cease I healths .— Nay , spill not , friend , for though the drops be small , Yet have they force , to force men to the wall .</p>
   <p>WOLSEY . Sir Christopher , is that your man ?</p>
   <p>HALES . And like your grace ; he is a Scholar and A Lingest , one that hath travelled many parts Of Christendom , my Lord .</p>
   <p>WOLSEY . My friend , come nearer ; have you been a traveller ?</p>
   <p>CROMWELL . My Lord , I have added to my knowledge the low Countries , France , Spain , Germany , and Italy : And though small gain of profit I did find , Yet did it please my eye , content my mind .</p>
   <p>WOLSEY . What do you think of the several states And princes ’ Courts as you have travelled ?</p>
   <p>CROMWELL . My Lord , no Court with England may compare , Neither for state nor civil government : Lust dwells in France , in Italy , and Spain , From the poor peasant to the Prince 's train , In Germany and Holland riot serves , And he that most can drink , most he deserves : England I praise not , for I here was borne , But that she laugheth the others unto scorn .</p>
   <p>WOLSEY . My Lord , there dwells within that spirit More than can be discerned by outward eye . Sir Christopher , will you part with your man ?</p>
   <p>HALES . I have sought to profer him to your Lordship , And now I see he hath prefered himself .</p>
   <p>WOLSEY . What is thy name ?</p>
   <p>CROMWELL . Cromwell , my Lord .</p>
   <p>WOLSEY . Then , Cromwell , here we make thee Solicitor of our causes , and nearest next our self . Gardiner give you kind welcome to the man .</p>
   <note>Gardiner embraces him .</note>
   <p>MORE . My Lord , you are a royal Winer , Have got a man besides your bounteous dinner . Well , Knight , pray we come no more : If we come often , thou maist shut thy door .</p>
   <p>WOLSEY . Sir Christopher , hadst thou given me half thy lands , Thou couldest not have pleased me so much as with This man of thine . My infant thoughts do spell : Shortly his fortune shall be lifted higher ; True industry doth kindle honour 's fire . And so , kind master of the Rules , farewell .</p>
   <p>HALES . Cromwell , farewell .</p>
   <p>CROMWELL . Cromwell takes his leave of you , That near will leave to love and honour you .</p>

   <p>CHORUS . Now Cromwell 's highest fortunes doth begin . Wolsey , that loved him as he did his life , Committed all his treasure to his hands . Wolsey is dead , and Gardiner , his man , Is now created Bishop of Winchester : Pardon if we omit all Wolsey 's life , Because our play depends on Cromwell 's death . Now sit and see his highest state of all ; His haight of rising and his sudden fall . Pardon the errors is all ready past , And live in hope the best doth come at last : My hope upon your favour doth depend , And look to have your liking ere the end .</p>

   <note>Enter Gardiner Bishop of Winchester , The Dukes of Norfolk , and of Suffolk , Sir Thomas More , Sir Christopher Hales , and Cromwell .</note>
   <p>NORFOLK . Master Cromwell , since Cardinal Wolsey 's death , His majesty is given to understand There 's certain bills and writings in your hand , That much concerns the state of England . My Lord of Winchester , is it not so ?</p>
   <p>GARDINER . My Lord of Norfolk , we two wear whilom fellows ; And , master Cromwell , though our master 's love Did bind us , while his love was to the King , It is not boot now to deny these things , Which may be prejudicial to the state : And though that God hath raised my fortune higher Than any way I looked for or deserved , Yet my life no longer with me dwell , Than I prove true unto my Sovereign : What say you , master Cromwell ? have you those writings ? Aye , or no ?</p>
   <p>CROMWELL . Here are the writings , and upon my knees , I give them up unto the worthy Dukes Of Suffolk and of Norfolk : he was my Master , And each virtuous part , That lived in him , I tendered with my heart ; But what his head complotted gainst the state My country 's love commands me that to hate . His sudden death I grieve for , not his fall , Because he sought to work my country 's thrall .</p>
   <p>SUFFOLK . Cromwell , the King shall hear of this thy duty , Whom I assure my self will well reward thee ; My Lord let 's go unto his Majesty , And show these writings which he longs to see .</p>
   <note>Exit Norfolk and Suffolk .</note>
   <note>Enter Bedford hastily .</note>
   <p>BEDFORD . How now , who 's this ? Cromwell , by my soul ! welcome to England : Thou once didst save my life , didst not Cromwell ?</p>
   <p>CROMWELL . If I did so , ‘ tis greater glory for me , That you remember it , than of my self Vainly to report it .</p>
   <p>BEDFORD . Well , Cromwell , now is the time , I shall commend thee to my Sovereign : Cheer up thy self , for I will raise thy state . A Russell yet was never found ingrate .</p>
   <note>Exit .</note>
   <p>HALES . O how uncertain is the wheel of state . Who lately greater than the Cardinal , For fear , and love ? and now who lower lies ? Gay honours are but Fortune 's flatteries , And whom this day pride and promotion swells , To morrow envy and ambition quells .</p>
   <p>MORE . Who sees the Cob-web intangle the poor Fly , May boldly say the wretches death is nigh .</p>
   <p>GARDINER . I knew his state and proud ambition Was too too violent to last over-long .</p>

   <p>NORFOLK . Cromwell , the majesty of England , For the good liking he conceives of thee , Makes thee master of the jewel house , Chief Secretary to himself , and with all , Creates thee one of his highness ’ privy Counsel .</p>
   <note>Enter the Earl of Bedford .</note>
   <p>BEDFORD . Where is sir Thomas Cromwell ? is he knighted ?</p>
   <p>SUFFOLK . He is , my Lord .</p>

   <p>CROMWELL . My Lords , These honors are too high for my desert .</p>
   <p>MORE . O content thee , man ; who would not choose it ? Yet thou art wise in seeming to refuse it .</p>
   <p>GARDINER . Here 's honors , titles , and promotions : I fear this climbing will have a sudden fall .</p>

   <p>FRISKIBALL . O Friskiball , what shall become of thee ? Where shalt thou go , or which way shalt thou turn Fortune , that turns her too unconstant wheel , Hath turned thy wealth and riches in the Sea . All parts abroad where ever I have been Grows weary of me , and denies me succour ; My debtors , they that should relieve my want , Forswears my money , says they owe me none : They know my state too mean to bear out law , And here in London , where I oft have been , And have done good to many a wretched man , I am now most wretched here , despised my self . In vain it is , more of their hearts to try ; Be patient , therefore , lay thee down and die .</p>
   <note>He lies down .</note>
   <note>Enter good man Seely , and his wife Joan .</note>
   <p>SEELY . Come , Joan , come ; let 's see what he 'll do for us now . Iwis we have done for him , when many a time and often he might have gone a hungry to bed .</p>
   <p>WIFE . Alas , man , now he is made a Lord , he 'll never look upon us ; he 'll fulfill the old Proverb : Set beggars a horse-back , and they 'll ride .— A , welliday for my Cow ! such as he hath made us come behind hand : we had never pawned our Cow else to pay our rent .</p>
   <p>SEELY . Well , Joan , he 'll come this way : and by God 's dickers , I 'll tell him roundly of it , and if he were ten Lords : a shall know that I had not my Cheese and my Bacon for nothing .</p>
   <p>WIFE . Do you remember , husband , how he would mooch up my Cheese cakes ? he hath forgot this now , but we 'll remember him .</p>
   <p>SEELY . Aye , we shall have now three flaps with a Fox tail ; but , I faith , I 'll gibber a joint , but I 'll tell him his own . Stay , who comes here ? O stand up ; here he comes ; stand up .</p>

   <p>GARDINER . Have I not reason , when religion is wronged ? You had no colour for what you have done .</p>
   <p>CROMWELL . Yes ; the abolishing of Antichrist , And of this Popish order from our Realm . I am no enemy to religion , But what is done , it is for England 's good . What did they serve for but to feed a sort Of lazy Abbots and of full fed Friars ? They neither plow , nor sow , and yet they reap The fat of all the Land , and suck the poor : Look , what was theirs , is in King Henry 's hands ; His wealth before lay in the Abbey lands .</p>
   <p>GARDINER . Indeed these things you have alleged , my Lord , When God doth know the infant yet unborn Will curse the time the Abbeys were pulled down . I pray , now where is hospitality ? Where now may poor distressed people go , For to relieve their need , or rest their bones , When weary travel doth oppress their limbs ? And where religious men should take them in , Shall now be kept back with a Mastiff do , And thousand thousand —</p>

   <p>FRISKIBALL . The same that brought you to your misery .</p>
   <p>BANISTER . Why would you not acquaint me with your state ? Is Banister your poor friend quite forgot : Whose goods , whose love , whose life and all is yours ?</p>
   <p>FRISKIBALL . I thought your usage would be as the rest , That had more kindness at my hands than you , Yet looked askance , when as they saw me poor .</p>
   <p>MISTRESS BANISTER . If Banister should bear so base a heart , I never would look my husband in the face , But hate him as I would a Cockatrise .</p>
   <p>BANISTER . And well thou mightest , should Banister deal so . Since that I saw you , sir , my state is mended : And for the thousand pound I owe to you , I have it ready for you , sir , at home ; And though I grieve your fortune is so bad , Yet that my hap 's to help you make me glad . And now , sir , will it please you walk with me ?</p>
   <p>FRISKIBALL . Not yet I cannot , for the Lord Chancellor Hath here commanded me to wait on him , For what I know not : pray God tis for my good .</p>
   <p>BANISTER . never make doubt of that ; I 'll warrant you , He is as kind a noble gentleman As ever did possess the place he hath .</p>

   <p>FRISKIBALL . With all my heart : but what 's become of Bagot ?</p>
   <p>BANISTER . He is hanged , for buying jewels of the King 's .</p>

   <p>FIRST MERCHANT . By my faith , your sum is more than mine , And yet i am not much behind you too , Considering that to day I paid at court .</p>
   <p>SECOND MERCHANT . Mass , and well remembered , What 's the reason the Lord Cromwell 's men Wear such long skirts upon their coats . They reach almost down to their very ham .</p>
   <p>FIRST MERCHANT . I will resolve you , sir ; and thus it is : The Bishop of Winchester , that loves not Cromwell , As great men are envied , as well as less — A while ago there was a jar between them , And it was brought to my Lord Cromwell 's ear , That Bishop Gardiner would sit on his skirt ; Upon which word , he made his men long Blue coats , And in the Court wore one of them himself : And meeting with the Bishop , quoth he , ‘ My Lord , Here 's skirt enough now for your Grace to sit on ; ’ Which vexed the Bishop to the very heart . This is the reason why they wear long coats .</p>
   <p>SECOND MERCHANT . Tis always seen , and mark it for a rule , That one great man will envy still another : But tis a thing that nothing concerns me . What , shall we now to Master Banister 's ?</p>

Although that duty to these noble men Doth challenge it , yet I 'll make bold with them . Your head doth bear the calendar of care . What , Cromwell covered and his Father bare ! It must not be . Now , sir , to you . Is not Your name Friskiball and a Florentine ?</p>
   <p>FRISKIBALL . My name was Friskiball , till cruel fate Did rob me of my name and of my state .</p>
   <p>CROMWELL . What fortune brought you to this country now ?</p>
   <p>FRISKIBALL . All other parts hath left me succourless , Save only this . Because of debts I have , I hope to gain for to relieve my want .</p>
   <p>CROMWELL . Did you not once , upon your Florence bridge , Help two distressed men , robbed by the Bandetti ?— His name was Cromwell .</p>
   <p>FRISKIBALL . I never made my brain a calendar Of any good I did ; I always loved this nation with my heart .</p>
   <p>CROMWELL . I am that Cromwell that you there relieved . Sixteen Ducats you gave me for to clothe me , Sixteen to bear my charges by the way , And sixteen more I had for my horse hire : There be those several sums justly returned , Yet with injustice , serving at my need , And to repay them without interest . Therefore receive of me these four several bags ; In each of them there is four hundred mark ; And bring me the names of all your debitors , And if they will not see you paid , I will : O God forbid , that I should see him fall , That helped me in my greatest need of all . Here stands my Father that first gave me life , Alas , what duty is too much for him ? This man in time of need did save my life , And therefore I cannot do too much for him . By this old man I often times was fed , Else might I have gone supperless to bed . Such kindness have I had of these three men , That Cromwell no way can repay again . Now in to dinner , for we stay too long , And to good stomachs is no greater wrong .</p>

   <p>GARDINER . Marry , my Lords , thus : by an Act he made himself , With an intent to entrap some of our lives , And this it is : If any Counsellor Be convicted of high treason , he shall Be executed without a public trial . This Act , my Lords , he caused the King to make .</p>

   <note>Enter Cromwell with his train . Bedford makes as though he would speak to him : he goes on .</note>
   <p>CROMWELL . You 're well encountered , my good Lord of Bedford . I see your honour is addressed to talk ; Pray pardon me , I am sent for to the king , And do not know the business yet my self . So fare you well , for I must needs be gone .</p>

   <p>CROMWELL . The second time well met , my Lord of Bedford ; I am very sorry that my haste is such . Lord Marquess Dorset being sick to death , I must receive of him the privy seal . At Lambeth , soon , my Lord , we 'll talk our fill .</p>

   <p>GARDINER . This is no place to reckon up your crime ; Your Dove-like looks were viewed with serpent 's eyes .</p>
   <p>CROMWELL . With serpent 's eyes , indeed , by thine they were ; But Gardiner do thy worst , I fear thee not . My faith , compared with thine , as much shall pass , As doth the Diamond excel the glass . Attached of treason , no accusers by ! Indeed , what tongue dares speak so foul a lie ?</p>
   <p>NORFOLK . My Lord , my Lord , matters are too well known , And it is time the king had note thereof .</p>

   <p>FIRST CITIZEN . Why , can this news be true ? ist possible ? The great Lord Cromwell arrested upon treason ! I hardly will believe it can be so .</p>
   <p>SECOND CITIZEN . It is too true , sir ; would it were otherwise , Condition I spent half the wealth I had . I was at Lambeth , saw him there arrested , And afterward committed to the Tower .</p>
   <p>FIRST CITIZEN . What , wast for treason that he was committed ?</p>
   <p>SECOND CITIZEN . Kind , noble Gentleman ! I may rue the time . All that I have , I did enjoy by him , And if he die , then all my state is gone .</p>
   <p>FIRST CITIZEN . It may be doubted that he shall not die , Because the King did favour him so much .</p>
   <p>SECOND CITIZEN . O sir , you are deceived in thinking so . The grace and favour he had with the king Hath caused him have so many enemies : He that in court secure will keep himself , Must not be great , for then he is envied at . The Shrub is safe , when as the Cedar shakes ; For where the King doth love above compare , Of others they as much more envied are .</p>
   <p>FIRST CITIZEN . Tis pity that this noble man should fall , He did so many charitable deeds .</p>
   <p>SECOND CITIZEN . Tis true , and yet you see in each estate , There 's none so good , but some one doth him hate . And they before would smile him in the face , Will be the formost to do him disgrace : What , will you go along unto the Court ?</p>
   <p>FIRST CITIZEN . I care not if I do , and hear the news , How men will judge what shall become of him .</p>
   <p>SECOND CITIZEN . Some will speak hardly , some will speak in pity . Go you to the Court , I 'll unto the City ; There I am sure to hear more news than you .</p>

   <p>ACT V. SCENE V. A room in the Tower .</p>
   <note>Enter Cromwell in the Tower .</note>
   <p>CROMWELL . Now , Cromwell , hast thou time to meditate , And think upon thy state , and of the time . Thy honours came unsought , aye , and unlooked for ; Thy fall as sudden , and unlooked for too . What glory was in England that I had not ? Who in this land commanded more than Cromwell ? Except the King who greater than my self ? But now I see , what after ages shall : The greater men , more sudden is their fall . And now do I remember the Earl of Bedford Was very desirous for to speak to me , And afterward sent to me a letter , The which I think I have still in my pocket . Now may I read it , for I now have leisure , And this I take it is . [ He reads the Letter . ] My Lord , come not this night to Lambeth , For if you do , your state is overthrown . And much I doubt your life , and if you come ; Then if you love your self , stay where you are , O God ! had I but read this letter , Then had I been free from the Lion 's paw ; Deferring this to read until to morrow , I spurned at joy , and did embrace my sorrow .</p>
   <note>Enter the Lieutenant of the Tower and officers .</note>
   <p>Now , master Lieutenant , when 's this day of death ?</p>
   <p>LIEUTENANT . Alas , my Lord , would I might never see it . Here are the Dukes of Suffolk and of Norfolk , Winchester , Bedford , and sir Richard Ratcliffe , With others , but why they come I know not .</p>
   <p>CROMWELL . No matter wherefore , Cromwell is prepared ; For Gardiner has my state and life ensnared . Bid them come in , or you shall do them wrong , For here stands he , whom some thinks lives too long . Learning kills learning , and instead of Ink To dip his Pen , Cromwell 's heart blood doth drink .</p>
   <note>Enter all the Nobles .</note>
   <p>NORFOLK . Good morrow , Cromwell . What , alone , so sad ?</p>
   <p>CROMWELL . One good among you , none of you are bad .— For my part , it best fits me be alone ; Sadness with me , not I with any one . What , is the king acquainted with my cause ?</p>
   <p>NORFOLK . We have , and he hath answered us , my Lord .</p>
   <p>CROMWELL . How , shall I come to speak with him my self ?</p>
   <p>GARDINER . The King is so advertised of your guilt , he will by no means admit you to his presence .</p>
   <p>CROMWELL . No way admit me ? am I so soon forgot ? Did he but yesterday embrace my neck , And said that Cromwell was even half himself , And is his Princely ears so much bewitched With scandalous ignomy , and slanderous speeches , That now he dooth deny to look on me ? Well , my Lord of Winchester , no doubt but you Are much in favour with his Majesty : Will you bear a letter from me to his grace ?</p>
   <p>GARDINER . Pardon me , I 'll bear no traitor 's letters .</p>
   <p>CROMWELL . Ha ! Will you do this kindness then ? Tell him By word of mouth , what I shall say to you ?</p>
   <p>GARDINER . That will I .</p>
   <p>CROMWELL . But , on your honour , will you ?</p>
   <p>GARDINER . Aye , on my honor .</p>
   <p>CROMWELL . Bear witness , Lords .— Tell him when he hath known you , And tried your faith but half so much as mine , He 'll find you to be the falsest hearted man In England . Pray , tell him this .</p>
   <p>BEDFORD . Be patient , good my Lord , in these extremes .</p>
   <p>CROMWELL . My kind and honorable Lord of Bedford , I know your honor always loved me well ; But , pardon me , this still shall be my theme ; Gardiner is the cause makes Cromwell so extreme . Sir Ralph Sadler , pray , a word with you : You were my man , and all that you possess Came by my means ; to requite all this , Will you take this letter here of me , And give it with your own hands to the king ?</p>
   <p>SADLER . I kiss your hand , and never will I rest , Ere to the king this will be delivered .</p>
   <note>Exit Sadler .</note>
   <p>CROMWELL . Why yet Cromwell hath one friend in store .</p>
   <p>GARDINER . But all the haste he makes shall be but vain .— Here 's a discharge for your prisoner , To see him executed presently .— My Lord , you hear the tenor of your life .</p>
   <p>CROMWELL . I do embrace it , welcome my last date , And of this glistering world I take last leave : And , noble Lords , I take my leave of you .— As willingly I go to meet with death , As Gardiner did pronounce it with his breath : From treason is my heart as white as snow , My death only procured by my foe . I pray , commend me to my Sovereign king , And tell him in what sort his Cromwell died , To lose his head before his cause were tried : But let his Grace , when he shall hear my name , Say only this : Gardiner procured the same .</p>
   <note>Enter young Cromwell .</note>
   <p>LIEUTENANT . Here is your son , come to take his leave .</p>
   <p>CROMWELL . To take his leave ! Come hither , Harry Cromwell . Mark , boy , the last words that I speak to thee . Flatter not Fortune , neither fawn upon her ; Gape not for state , yet lose no spark of honor ; Ambition , like the plague see thou eschew it ; I die for treason , boy , and never knew it . Yet let thy faith as spotless be as mine , And Cromwell 's virtues in thy face shall shine . Come , go along and see me leave my breath , And I 'll leave thee upon the flower of death .</p>
   <p>SON . O , father , I shall die to see that wound ; Your blood being spilt will make my heart to sound .</p>
   <p>CROMWELL . How , boy , not look upon the Axe ! How shall I do then to have my head stroke off ? Come on , my child , and see the end of all , And after say that Gardiner was my fall .</p>
   <p>GARDINER . My Lord , you speak it of an envious heart ; I have done no more than law and equity .</p>
   <p>BEDFORD . O , good my Lord of Winchester , forbear ; It would a better seemed you to been absent , Than with your words disturb a dying man .</p>
   <p>CROMWELL . Who me , my Lord ? no , he disturbs not me . My mind he stirs not , though his mighty shock Hath brought mo ’ peers ’ heads down to the block . Farewell , my boy ! all Cromwell can bequeath , My hearty blessing ; so I take my leave .</p>
   <p>HANGMAN . I am your death 's man ; pray , my Lord , forgive me .</p>
   <p>CROMWELL . Even with my soul . Why , man , thou art my Doctor , And brings me precious Physic for my soul .— My Lord of Bedford , I desire of you , Before my death , a corporal embrace .</p>
