   <head>SAMUEL DANIEL</head>
   <p>Daniel 's sonnet series has been by many regarded as the prototype of Shakespeare 's . It is true that several of Daniel 's themes are repeated in the cycle composed by the greater poet . The ideas of immortality in verse , the transitoriness of beauty , the assurances of truth , the humility and the woes of the lover , the pain of separation and the comfort of night thoughts , shape the mood of both poets . But these motives are also found in the pages of many other sonneteers of the time . All these devotees seem to have had a storehouse of poetic conceits which they held in common , and from which each poet had the right to draw materials to use in his own way . In fact Shakespeare 's sonnets are full of echoes from the voices of Sidney , Constable , Davies , Lodge , Watson , Drayton and Barnes , as well as from that mellifluous one of Daniel ; and these poetic conceits were tossed forth in the first place by the Italian sonnet makers , led by Petrarch . It is evident that Daniel 's Petrarch has been well-thumbed . Wood says that Daniel left Oxford without a degree because “ his geny ” was “ more prone to easier and smoother studies than in pecking and hewing at logic , ” and we may believe that Italian was one of these smoother studies . His translation of Paolo Giovi 's work on Emblems , which was published in 1585 , was doubtless one fruit of this study , a work that since it took him into the very realm of the concetti , was to be a potent influence upon his mental growth . The main theme , the cruelty of the Fair , is the same as that of Petrarch . Daniel follows this master in making the vale echo with his sighs , in appealing to her hand and cruel bosom for mercy , in recounting the number of years he has worshipped her and honored her with sonnets on which he is depending for immortal fame , in upbraiding her for her devotion to the mirror rather than to him , and for ensnaring him with the golden net of her hair and transpiercing him with the darts from her crystalline eyes . In some of Petrarch 's nobler flights Daniel does not follow ; the higher teachings of love are not revealed to him , the step from human to divine he does not take ; yet in the main , the features of the earlier poet re-appear in Daniel 's verse , as they do in most of his fellow-sonneteers , including Shakespeare .</p>
   <p>It is also not best to give too much weight to the opinion that Shakespeare has been over-influenced by Daniel in the adoption of the quatrain and couplet structure . The whole period from Wyatt to Shakespeare shows a slow and steady mastery of the native over the foreign tendency . The change was not a sudden leap on the part of Daniel and Shakespeare , but a gradual growth occupying a half century and culminating in the English form . But if we should feel convinced that Shakespeare 's memory was influenced by the sound of Daniel 's cadences , this need not be considered discreditable to Shakespeare . Daniel 's lines are smooth and melodious , and he was perhaps as great a master of the technique of rhyme as was Shakespeare . If we take the sonnets of both poets as criterion , the careful Daniel uses twice as many rhyme colours as Shakespeare , while Shakespeare repeats rhymes twice as often as Daniel . If double rhymes find less favor with the captious , we admit that Daniel has a third more than Shakespeare has , but again Shakespeare uses twice as many rhymes on syllables with secondary stress as does Daniel , and Shakespeare 's bad rhymes are as bad as Daniel 's and more frequent .</p>
   <p>Daniel 's poetic powers were appreciated to the full in his time . To his contemporaries he was the “ well languaged , ” the “ sharp conceited , ” one by whose verse Rosamond was eternised , one who “ divinely sonnetted his Delia . ” When Judicio in The Return from Parnassus makes his inventory of poet 's qualities , in giving his judgment on Daniel , he evidently has the Delia in mind .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Sweet honey-dropping Daniel doth wage</l>
     <l n="2">War with the proudest big Italian</l>
     <l n="3">That melts his heart in sugared sonnetting . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>If Jonson , Daniel 's rival as maker of masques for the Court , proclaimed him a good honest man but no poet , Spenser generously said he surpassed “ all that afore him came ; ” and scarcely one of the more prominent of his contemporaries failed to address compliments to him . When Daniel was gentleman extraordinary and groom of the privy chamber to Anne , Queen-consort to James I ., the Queen is said to have been a “ favourer and encourager of his muse ; ” and his high social position made it easy for less favoured aspirants to praise him . But the perspective of time brings a more balanced judgment . While Lowell finds in the fact that Daniel was held in high esteem by his contemporaries a proof that noble diction was appreciated then as now , and while he admits that Daniel refined our tongue , yet he decided that Daniel had the thinking and languaging parts of a poet 's outfit but lacked the higher creative gift . We shall find Daniel at his best , not when in prosaic soberness he sings</p>
   <p>“ ... the civil wars , tumultuous broils , And bloody factions of a mighty land . ”</p>
   <p>not when he is framing stilted tragedies with chorus and declamation in the grand Senecan manner , not in his complimentary addresses to lords , ladies and royalty , nor in the classic masques and philosophical dialogue , but in the less ambitious poems of Delia and Rosamond , especially in such a sonnet as “ Care-charmer Sleep , ” where we come more near to hearing a human heart beat than in any of the others . It is not a mighty heart , but it is one that is gentle , tender and pure .</p>
   <p>A glance at the life of Daniel gives opportunity for an easy conjecture as to the personality of the lady honoured under the name of Delia . At seventeen Daniel was at Oxford , and finished a three years ’ residence at Magdalen College in 1582 . After a visit to Italy , he became established at Wilton as tutor to the sons of Mary Sidney , Countess of Pembroke . To those early days at Wilton the poet refers , when in 1603 he dedicates his Defense of Rhyme to William Herbert , Earl of Pembroke , his former pupil . In the introduction to this fine essay Daniel declares that in regard to his poetic studies he was “ first encouraged and framed thereunto by your most worthy and honourable mother , and received the first notion for the formal ordering of those compositions at Wilton which I must ever acknowledge as my best school , and thereof always am to hold a feeling and grateful memory . ” At this time the home of the Herberts at Wilton was a literary centre . The Countess was herself an industrious author , and the subject of innumerable dedicatory addresses . She seems to have been as beautiful as she was gracious and gifted . In the Penshurst picture we see her in extreme youth . The long oval and delicate chiselling of the Sidney face are expressed in their finest perfection , and justify the resemblance , found by Spenser , to “ her brother dear . ” The soft hair is of the same golden-brown as his , the colour her eldest son inherited , and which Shakespeare is said to have described in his figure of the marjoram-buds . In the picture by Gheeraedts at the National Portrait Gallery , painted in 1614 , she has lost little of her youthful beauty , but has added the special graces of maturity . The hair is still a rich brown . A thoughtful soul sits brooding behind those attentive eyes — a soul that seems to wish to ask the universal unanswerable questions , one that has grappled with doubt and struggled with environing circumstance , but has not yet consented to be baffled . The face is modern and complex . This accomplished lady received at Wilton the most distinguished people of her time . Her guests included Spenser , Raleigh , probably Shakespeare , Ben Jonson , Inigo Jones , Sir John Harrington , Dr. Donne , and many more ; and the Countess 's Pastoral Dialogue in Praise of Astraea was probably written in honour of a visit from the Queen herself . It would perhaps be strange if the young poet did not surround the personality of this fascinating patroness with a romantic halo and feel that his poetic fame was linked with hers . The Delia of the sonnets has all the excellencies that a sonnet-honoured lady should have , including locks of gold . But the fact that the poet has slyly changed the word “ amber ” to “ snary ” in sonnet xiv ., and “ golden ” to “ sable ” in sonnet xxxviii ., looks as if he desired to shield her personality from too blunt a guess . However , many hints are given ; she lives in the “ joyful North , ” in “ fair Albion ; ” she is</p>
   <p>“ The eternal wonder of our happy Isle . ”</p>
   <p>And the river by which he sounds her name is the Avon —</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ But Avon , poor in fame and poor in waters ,</l>
     <l n="2">Shall have my song , where Delia hath her seat . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The Wiltshire Avon is the proud brook that flows southward by Wilton , “ where Delia hath her seat . ” If it may seem in any degree unfitting that Daniel should address language so glowing as is found in the Delia sonnets to a lady who is established as the head of a household with husband and sons about her , attention may be called to the fact that the sonnets , though they are characterised by warmth of feeling and extravagance of expression , do not contain one tainted line . Posterity must justify what Daniel in proud humility said of himself :</p>
   <p>“ I . . . . . . . . . . never had my harmless pen at all Distained with any loose immodesty , But still have done the fairest offices To virtue and the time . ”</p>
   <p>The respectful dignity of Daniel 's prose dedication of Delia to Mary Sidney cannot be surpassed ; and the introductory sonnet that displaces it in the next edition , while confessing the ardent devotion of the writer , is yet couched in the most reverent terms . Daniel and other sonneteers had the great example of Petrarch in honouring a lady with admiration and love expressed in verses whose warmth might perhaps not have been so excusable , could the poet have been taken at his word . The new sonnets inserted in the editions of 1601 and 1623 show the faithfulness of the poet 's homage . A loyal friendship , whether formed upon gratitude only or upon some warmer feeling , inspired the Delia although the poet expresses his devotion in the conventional modes . But that Daniel outgrew to some extent the taste for these fanciful devices is shown by the changes he made in successive editions . Four sonnets from the 1591 edition were never reprinted , another was reprinted once and afterwards omitted . In our text the order of the 1623 edition is followed , the edition that was supervised by the poet 's brother ; but these omitted sonnets will be found at the end under the head of Rejected Sonnets . It is certain that they are Daniel 's and that he rejected them , and it therefore seems no more than fair to the poet , if they are reprinted at all , to insert them under this head .</p>
   <p>While , then , these rejected sonnets may have been in two cases omitted by the poet because of their too great frankness of expression , in other cases , notably in the phoenix , the wax-image , the tablet-and-siren , the vanquished fort , and the ermelin sonnets , they seem to have lost their charm , not so much for any personal reason as for the artistic defect in the far-fetched nature of the device .</p>
   <p>Daniel lived till 1619 , experiencing the usual ups and downs in the career of a “ Court-dear poet . ” In later years , the famous Lady Anne Clifford , wife of Mary Sidney 's younger son , caused a monument to be erected in his honour , in the inscription upon which she recorded her pride in the fact that he had once been her tutor .</p>

    <head>DIANA</head>
    <head>BY</head>
    <head>HENRY CONSTABLE</head>
    <head>HENRY CONSTABLE</head>
    <head>The sonnet-cycle in the hands of Henry Constable seems to have been in the first place rather a record of a succession of “ moment 's monuments ” than a single dramatic scheme , even an embryonic one . The quaint preface found in the Harleian transcript of the Diana shows this , and at the same time tells what freedom was at that period allowed in the structure and dove-tailing of a sonnet-cycle . It is as follows :</head>
     <l n="1">“ The Sonnets following are divided into 3 parts , each parte</l>
     <l n="2">contayning 3 several arguments and every argument 7 sonets .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>“ The first parte is of variable affections of love : wherein the first 7 be of the beginning and byrth of his love ; the second 7 , of the prayse of his mistresse ; the thyrd 7 , of severall accidents hapning in the tyme of his love .</p>
   <p>“ The second is the prayse of perticulars : wherein the first 7 be of the generall honoure of this ile , through the prayses of the heads thereof , the Q. of England and K. of Scots ; the second 7 celebrate the memory of perticular ladies whoe the author most honoureth : the thyrd 7 be to the honoure of perticulars , presented upon severall occasions .</p>
   <p>“ The thyrd parte is tragicall , conteyning only lamentations : wherein the first 7 be complaynts onlye of misfortunes in love , the second 7 , funerall sonets of the death of perticulars ; the last 7 , of the end and death of his love . ”</p>
   <p>The four sonnets to that distinguished “ perticular , ” the King of Scotland , seem to have won for the author a great deal of fame , for Bolton mentions one of them as a witness to his opinion that “ noble Henry Constable was a great master in English tongue , nor had any gentleman of our nation a more pure , quick , or higher delivery of conceit . ” The King himself the poet is said to have met personally when on his propagandist tours in Scotland ; for Constable was an ardent Roman Catholic , and spent most of his life in plots for the re-establishment of that faith in England . Among the other “ perticulars ” addressed , the Queen is of course bounteously favoured , and a number of ladies of her Court are honoured ; the series therefore lacks all pretense of unity . In fact , the title of the 1594 edition declares that the “ excellent conceitful sonnets of Henry Constable ” are “ augmented with divers quartorzains of honourable and learned personages ; ” and Sidney has been found to be one of the “ honourable and learned personages ” whose works were laid under contribution to make the book ; but since the whole first and second decades are the same as in the earlier volume by “ H. C . ” which contained also the King James sonnets attributed by numerous contemporaries to Henry Constable , and since as yet , beside the ten by Sidney , no more of the sonnets have by antiquarian research been traced to their sources in the mazes of Elizabethan common-place books , it seems but fair to leave the Diana of 1594 in the hands of Constable . All three books , the ‘ 92 and ‘ 94 editions and the manuscript volume , show a like taste for orderly arrangement not found in general in the sonnet-cycles .</p>
   <p>Constable was a Cambridge man and was thirty years old when the Diana was first printed . He lived until 1613 and bore an excellent reputation in his day . He was the friend of Ben Jonson , who speaks of his “ ambrosaic Muse , ” of Sidney , Harington , Tofte , and other literary men . If toying with the sonnet in Diana seems to indicate a light and trifling spirit , we have to yield that with Constable as with Fletcher the graver matters of state policy formed the chief interest in life to the author . In Constable 's case the interest was religious and the poet was personally a man of devout feeling . Writing from the Tower , where for a time he was detained , he says , “ Whether I remain in prison or go out , I have learned to live alone with God . ” At the conclusion of the third part of the Harleian Miscellany transcript , the author says : “ When I had ended this last sonnet , and found that such vain poems as I had by idle hours writ , did amount just to the diametrical number 63 , methought it was high time for my folly to die , and to employ the remnant of my wit to other calmer thoughts less sweet and less bitter . ” It was probably in a mood like this that the poet turned from his devotion to an earthly love and began to write his “ Sonnets in honor of God and his Saints . ” In this group , as in the other , he expresses that passion for beauty characteristic of the renaissance , but here he shows the lack of a clear conception as to where the line should be drawn between earthly and heavenly beauty . In Constable we see the new revelation barely emerging from the darkness , the human hand reaching out in art toward the divine , but not knowing how to take and hold the higher in its grasp . These sonnets are as “ conceitful ” as the others , but the collection illustrates an early effort to turn the poetic energy into a new field , to broaden the scope of subject-matter possible in sonnet-form . The poet was evidently a close student of the sonnet-structure . He used the Italian and the English form in about an equal number of cases but he experiments on a large variety of rime-arrangements besides .</p>
   <p>As to the personality honoured under the name of Diana , there seems to be much obscurity . From the sonnet To his Mistress , we learn that though he addresses several he loves but one .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Grace full of grace , though in these verses here</l>
     <l n="2">My love complains of others than of thee ,</l>
     <l n="3">Yet thee alone I loved , and they by me ,</l>
     <l n="4">Thou yet unknown , only mistaken were . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>So he loved her , it seems , while she was “ yet unknown , ” something quite possible in the sonneteer 's world : and her personality , though shadowed under various names , is to the poet a distinct conception . To the honour of being this poet 's inspirer , there are two claimants ; one the Lady Rich , the Stella of Sidney , the other the ill-fated Arabella Stuart . It is noteworthy that the only one of all the sonnets addressed personally to particular ladies that is retained in the edition of 1594 , is one to Lady Rich . But this sonnet tells us little except that “ wishèd fortune ” had once made it possible for him to see her in all her beauty of roses and lilies , stars and waves of gold : but this might have happened if he had once seen that beauteous lady pass along the street in the queen 's glittering train . Other sonnets to or about the Lady Rich are equally uncommunicative ; and if the ill-starred Penelope Devereux is the one alone that Constable loved , Time has shut the secret tightly in his heart and will not give it up .</p>
   <p>The other guess is but little nearer to certainty . During the years that Constable was pursuing his shadowy schemes , Arabella Stuart was an object of admiration and of political jealousy ; the house where she lived was constantly spied upon , her very tutors were suspected , the wildest schemes were formed upon her royal connections , and it would not be strange if the heart of our poetical zealot turned toward this star of his cause . We may be sure that he would not have been averse to a clandestine meeting , for in writing to that arch-plotter , the Countess of Shrewsbury , Arabella 's doting grandmother , he says : “ It is more convenient to write unto your Ladyship , than to come unto you or to make any other visits either by day or night till I have further liberty granted me ; ” besides this , the Earl of Shrewsbury was distantly related to Constable 's family , and this fact of kinship may have opened the way ; while his sonnet to the Countess intimates that his heart had been touched by some beauty in her Venus ’ camp . If not Arabella , who could this be ?</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ To you then , you , the fairest of the wise ,</l>
     <l n="2">And wisest of the fair I do appeal .</l>
     <l n="3">A warrior of your camp by force of eyes</l>
     <l n="4">Me prisoner took , and will with rigour deal ,</l>
     <l n="5">Except you pity in your heart will place ,</l>
     <l n="6">At whose white hands I only seek for grace . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="7">As before , the sonnets addressed to Arabella give no definite</l>
     <l n="8">information . The first is in the usual strain of praise , and closes :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">“ My drift was this ,</l>
     <l n="10">Some earthly shadow of thy worth to show</l>
     <l n="11">Whose heavenly self above world 's reason is . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="12">The second is as follows :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="13">“ Only hope of our age , that virtues dead</l>
     <l n="14">By your sweet breath should be revived again ;</l>
     <l n="15">Learning discouraged long by rude disdain</l>
     <l n="16">By your white hands is only cherishèd .</l>
     <l n="17">Thus others ’ worth by you is honourèd .</l>
     <l n="18">But who shall honour yours ? Poor wits , in vain</l>
     <l n="19">We seek to pay the debts which you pertain</l>
     <l n="20">Till from yourself some wealth be borrowèd .</l>
     <l n="21">Lend some your tongues , that every nation may</l>
     <l n="22">In his own hear your virtuous praises blaze ;</l>
     <l n="23">Lend them your wit , your judgment , memory ,</l>
     <l n="24">Lest they themselves should not know what to say ;</l>
     <l n="25">And that thou mayst be loved as much as praised ,</l>
     <l n="26">My heart thou mayst lend them which I gave thee . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="27">The last of Constable 's sonnets in the edition of 1592 is this</l>
     <l n="28">dedicatory address :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="29">“ My mistress ’ worth gave wings unto my muse</l>
     <l n="30">And my muse wings did give unto her name ,</l>
     <l n="31">So , like twin birds , my muse bred with her fame</l>
     <l n="32">Together now do learn their wings to use .</l>
     <l n="33">And in this book , which here you may peruse ,</l>
     <l n="34">Abroad they fly , resolved to try the same</l>
     <l n="35">Adventure in their flight ; and thee , sweet dame ,</l>
     <l n="36">Both she and I for our protection choose ;</l>
     <l n="37">I by my vow , and she by farther right</l>
     <l n="38">Under your phoenix ( wing ) presume to fly ;</l>
     <l n="39">That from all carrion beaks in safety might</l>
     <l n="40">By one same wing be shrouded , she and I .</l>
     <l n="41">O happy , if I might but flitter there</l>
     <l n="42">Where you and she and I should be so near . ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>The value of this author 's praise , however , is somewhat impaired by the extravagances in certain sonnets where , for instance , he honours a lady whose soul , he says , was “ endued in her lifetime with infinite perfections as her divine poems do testify , ” when she on earth did sing poet-wise angels in heaven prayed for her company , and when she died , her “ fair and glittering rays increased the light of heaven ; ” where again he calls on the Countess of Essex to revenge the death of her first husband , Sir Philip Sidney , upon the Spanish people by murdering them en masse with her eyes , and where he calls the Countess of Shrewsbury “ chieftain of Venus 's host , ” and places her crowned in heaven beside the Virgin Mary . Constable 's zealous publisher was not far wrong when he claimed that in this poet “ conceit first claimed his birthright to enjoy , ” and since we do not find either in the sonnets to Lady Rich or in those to Lady Arabella any special tone of sincerity that leads us to have confidence in our conjecture , we shall be compelled to leave this puzzle unsolved .</p>
