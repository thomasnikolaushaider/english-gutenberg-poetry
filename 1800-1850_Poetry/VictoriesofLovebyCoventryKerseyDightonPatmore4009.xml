    <head>INTRODUCTION</head>
    <p n="1">After the very cordial reception given to the poems of “ The Angel in the House , ” which their author generously made accessible to the readers of these little books , it is evident that another volume from the same clear singer of the purity of household love requires no Introduction .</p>
    <p n="2">I have only , in the name of the readers , to thank Mr. Coventry Patmore for his liberality , and wish him — say , rather , assure him of — the best return he seeks in a wide influence for good .</p>

     <head>I . FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM .</head>
     <lg type="stanza" n="1">
      <l n="1">Mother , I smile at your alarms !</l>
      <l n="2">I own , indeed , my Cousin 's charms ,</l>
      <l n="3">But , like all nursery maladies ,</l>
      <l n="4">Love is not badly taken twice .</l>
      <l n="5">Have you forgotten Charlotte Hayes ,</l>
      <l n="6">My playmate in the pleasant days</l>
      <l n="7">At Knatchley , and her sister , Anne ,</l>
      <l n="8">The twins , so made on the same plan ,</l>
      <l n="9">That one wore blue , the other white ,</l>
      <l n="10">To mark them to their father 's sight ;</l>
      <l n="11">And how , at Knatchley harvesting ,</l>
      <l n="12">You bade me kiss her in the ring ,</l>
      <l n="13">Like Anne and all the others ? You ,</l>
      <l n="14">That never of my sickness knew ,</l>
      <l n="15">Will laugh , yet had I the disease ,</l>
      <l n="16">And gravely , if the signs are these :</l>
      <l n="17">As , ere the Spring has any power ,</l>
      <l n="18">The almond branch all turns to flower ,</l>
      <l n="19">Though not a leaf is out , so she</l>
      <l n="20">The bloom of life provoked in me</l>
      <l n="21">And , hard till then and selfish , I</l>
      <l n="22">Was thenceforth nought but sanctity</l>
      <l n="23">And service : life was mere delight</l>
      <l n="24">In being wholly good and right ,</l>
      <l n="25">As she was ; just , without a slur ;</l>
      <l n="26">Honouring myself no less than her ;</l>
      <l n="27">Obeying , in the loneliest place ,</l>
      <l n="28">Ev'n to the slightest gesture , grace ,</l>
      <l n="29">Assured that one so fair , so true ,</l>
      <l n="30">He only served that was so too .</l>
      <l n="31">For me , hence weak towards the weak ,</l>
      <l n="32">No more the unnested blackbird 's shriek</l>
      <l n="33">Startled the light-leaved wood ; on high</l>
      <l n="34">Wander 'd the gadding butterfly ,</l>
      <l n="35">Unscared by my flung cap ; the bee ,</l>
      <l n="36">Rifling the hollyhock in glee ,</l>
      <l n="37">Was no more trapp 'd with his own flower ,</l>
      <l n="38">And for his honey slain . Her power ,</l>
      <l n="39">From great things even to the grass</l>
      <l n="40">Through which the unfenced footways pass ,</l>
      <l n="41">Was law , and that which keeps the law ,</l>
      <l n="42">Cherubic gaiety and awe ;</l>
      <l n="43">Day was her doing , and the lark</l>
      <l n="44">Had reason for his song ; the dark</l>
      <l n="45">In anagram innumerous spelt</l>
      <l n="46">Her name with stars that throbb 'd and felt ;</l>
      <l n="47">‘ Twas the sad summit of delight</l>
      <l n="48">To wake and weep for her at night ;</l>
      <l n="49">She turn 'd to triumph or to shame</l>
      <l n="50">The strife of every childish game ;</l>
      <l n="51">The heart would come into my throat</l>
      <l n="52">At rosebuds ; howsoe'er remote ,</l>
      <l n="53">In opposition or consent ,</l>
      <l n="54">Each thing , or person , or event ,</l>
      <l n="55">Or seeming neutral howsoe'er ,</l>
      <l n="56">All , in the live , electric air ,</l>
      <l n="57">Awoke , took aspect , and confess 'd</l>
      <l n="58">In her a centre of unrest ,</l>
      <l n="59">Yea , stocks and stones within me bred</l>
      <l n="60">Anxieties of joy and dread .</l>
      <l n="61">O , bright apocalyptic sky</l>
      <l n="62">O'erarching childhood ! Far and nigh</l>
      <l n="63">Mystery and obscuration none ,</l>
      <l n="64">Yet nowhere any moon or sun !</l>
      <l n="65">What reason for these sighs ? What hope ,</l>
      <l n="66">Daunting with its audacious scope</l>
      <l n="67">The disconcerted heart , affects</l>
      <l n="68">These ceremonies and respects ?</l>
      <l n="69">Why stratagems in everything ?</l>
      <l n="70">Why , why not kiss her in the ring ?</l>
      <l n="71">‘ Tis nothing strange that warriors bold ,</l>
      <l n="72">Whose fierce , forecasting eyes behold</l>
      <l n="73">The city they desire to sack ,</l>
      <l n="74">Humbly begin their proud attack</l>
      <l n="75">By delving ditches two miles off ,</l>
      <l n="76">Aware how the fair place would scoff</l>
      <l n="77">At hasty wooing ; but , O child ,</l>
      <l n="78">Why thus approach thy playmate mild ?</l>
      <l n="79">One morning , when it flush 'd my thought</l>
      <l n="80">That , what in me such wonder wrought</l>
      <l n="81">Was call 'd , in men and women , love ,</l>
      <l n="82">And , sick with vanity thereof ,</l>
      <l n="83">I , saying loud , ‘ I love her , ’ told</l>
      <l n="84">My secret to myself , behold</l>
      <l n="85">A crisis in my mystery !</l>
      <l n="86">For , suddenly , I seem 'd to be</l>
      <l n="87">Whirl 'd round , and bound with showers of threads ,</l>
      <l n="88">As when the furious spider sheds</l>
      <l n="89">Captivity upon the fly</l>
      <l n="90">To still his buzzing till he die ;</l>
      <l n="91">Only , with me , the bonds that flew ,</l>
      <l n="92">Enfolding , thrill 'd me through and through</l>
      <l n="93">With bliss beyond aught heaven can have ,</l>
      <l n="94">And pride to dream myself her slave .</l>
      <l n="95">A long , green slip of wilder 'd land ,</l>
      <l n="96">With Knatchley Wood on either hand ,</l>
      <l n="97">Sunder 'd our home from hers . This day</l>
      <l n="98">Glad was I as I went her way .</l>
      <l n="99">I stretch 'd my arms to the sky , and sprang</l>
      <l n="100">O'er the elastic sod , and sang</l>
      <l n="101">‘ I love her , love her ! ’ to an air</l>
      <l n="102">Which with the words came then and there ;</l>
      <l n="103">And even now , when I would know</l>
      <l n="104">All was not always dull and low ,</l>
      <l n="105">I mind me awhile of the sweet strain</l>
      <l n="106">Love taught me in that lonely lane .</l>
      <l n="107">Such glories fade , with no more mark</l>
      <l n="108">Than when the sunset dies to dark .</l>
      <l n="109">They pass , the rapture and the grace</l>
      <l n="110">Ineffable , their only trace</l>
      <l n="111">A heart which , having felt no less</l>
      <l n="112">Than pure and perfect happiness ,</l>
      <l n="113">Is duly dainty of delight ;</l>
      <l n="114">A patient , poignant appetite</l>
      <l n="115">For pleasures that exceed so much</l>
      <l n="116">The poor things which the world calls such .</l>
      <l n="117">That , when these lure it , then you may</l>
      <l n="118">The lion with a wisp of hay .</l>
      <l n="119">That Charlotte , whom we scarcely knew</l>
      <l n="120">From Anne but by her ribbons blue ,</l>
      <l n="121">Was loved , Anne less than look 'd at , shows</l>
      <l n="122">That liking still by favour goes !</l>
      <l n="123">This Love is a Divinity ,</l>
      <l n="124">And holds his high election free</l>
      <l n="125">Of human merit ; or let 's say ,</l>
      <l n="126">A child by ladies call 'd to play ,</l>
      <l n="127">But careless of their becks and wiles ,</l>
      <l n="128">Till , seeing one who sits and smiles</l>
      <l n="129">Like any else , yet only charms ,</l>
      <l n="130">He cries to come into her arms .</l>
      <l n="131">Then , for my Cousins , fear me not !</l>
      <l n="132">None ever loved because he ought .</l>
      <l n="133">Fatal were else this graceful house ,</l>
      <l n="134">So full of light from ladies ’ brows .</l>
      <l n="135">There 's Mary ; Heaven in her appears</l>
      <l n="136">Like sunshine through the shower 's bright tears ;</l>
      <l n="137">Mildred 's of Earth , yet happier far</l>
      <l n="138">Than most men 's thoughts of Heaven are ;</l>
      <l n="139">But , for Honoria , Heaven and Earth</l>
      <l n="140">Seal 'd amity in her sweet birth .</l>
      <l n="141">The noble Girl ! With whom she talks</l>
      <l n="142">She knights first with her smile ; she walks ,</l>
      <l n="143">Stands , dances , to such sweet effect ,</l>
      <l n="144">Alone she seems to move erect .</l>
      <l n="145">The brightest and the chastest brow</l>
      <l n="146">Rules o'er a cheek which seems to show</l>
      <l n="147">That love , as a mere vague suspense</l>
      <l n="148">Of apprehensive innocence ,</l>
      <l n="149">Perturbs her heart ; love without aim</l>
      <l n="150">Or object , like the sunlit flame</l>
      <l n="151">That in the Vestals ’ Temple glow 'd ,</l>
      <l n="152">Without the image of a god .</l>
      <l n="153">And this simplicity most pure</l>
      <l n="154">She sets off with no less allure</l>
      <l n="155">Of culture , subtly skill 'd to raise</l>
      <l n="156">The power , the pride , and mutual praise</l>
      <l n="157">Of human personality</l>
      <l n="158">Above the common sort so high ,</l>
      <l n="159">It makes such homely souls as mine</l>
      <l n="160">Marvel how brightly life may shine .</l>
      <l n="161">How you would love her ! Even in dress</l>
      <l n="162">She makes the common mode express</l>
      <l n="163">New knowledge of what 's fit so well</l>
      <l n="164">‘ Tis virtue gaily visible !</l>
      <l n="165">Nay , but her silken sash to me</l>
      <l n="166">Were more than all morality ,</l>
      <l n="167">Had not the old , sweet , feverous ill</l>
      <l n="168">Left me the master of my will !</l>
      <l n="169">So , Mother , feel at rest , and please</l>
      <l n="170">To send my books on board . With these ,</l>
      <l n="171">When I go hence , all idle hours</l>
      <l n="172">Shall help my pleasures and my powers .</l>
      <l n="173">I 've time , you know , to fill my post ,</l>
      <l n="174">And yet make up for schooling lost</l>
      <l n="175">Through young sea-service . They all speak</l>
      <l n="176">German with ease ; and this , with Greek ,</l>
      <l n="177">( Which Dr. Churchill thought I knew ,)</l>
      <l n="178">And history , which I fail 'd in too ,</l>
      <l n="179">Will stop a gap I somewhat dread ,</l>
      <l n="180">After the happy life I 've led</l>
      <l n="181">With these my friends ; and sweet ‘ twill be</l>
      <l n="182">To abridge the space from them to me .</l>

     <lg type="stanza" n="2">
      <l n="183">My Child , Honoria Churchill sways</l>
      <l n="184">A double power through Charlotte Hayes .</l>
      <l n="185">In minds to first-love 's memory pledged</l>
      <l n="186">The second Cupid 's born full-fledged .</l>
      <l n="187">I saw , and trembled for the day</l>
      <l n="188">When you should see her beauty , gay</l>
      <l n="189">And pure as apple-blooms , that show</l>
      <l n="190">Outside a blush and inside snow ,</l>
      <l n="191">Her high and touching elegance</l>
      <l n="192">Of order 'd life as free as chance .</l>
      <l n="193">Ah , haste from her bewitching side ,</l>
      <l n="194">No friend for you , far less a bride !</l>
      <l n="195">But , warning from a hope so wild ,</l>
      <l n="196">I wrong you . Yet this know , my Child :</l>
      <l n="197">He that but once too nearly hears</l>
      <l n="198">The music of forefended spheres ,</l>
      <l n="199">Is thenceforth lonely , and for all</l>
      <l n="200">His days like one who treads the Wall</l>
      <l n="201">Of China , and , on this hand , sees</l>
      <l n="202">Cities and their civilities ,</l>
      <l n="203">And on the other , lions . Well ,</l>
      <l n="204">( Your rash reply I thus foretell . )</l>
      <l n="205">Good is the knowledge of what 's fair ,</l>
      <l n="206">Though bought with temporal despair !</l>
      <l n="207">Yes , good for one , but not for two .</l>
      <l n="208">Will it content a wife that you</l>
      <l n="209">Should pine for love , in love 's embrace ,</l>
      <l n="210">Through having known a happier grace ;</l>
      <l n="211">And break with inward sighs your rest ,</l>
      <l n="212">Because , though good , she 's not the best ?</l>
      <l n="213">You would , you think , be just and kind ,</l>
      <l n="214">And keep your counsel ! You will find</l>
      <l n="215">You cannot such a secret keep ;</l>
      <l n="216">‘ Twill out , like murder , in your sleep ;</l>
      <l n="217">A touch will tell it , though , for pride ,</l>
      <l n="218">She may her bitter knowledge hide ;</l>
      <l n="219">And , while she accepts love 's make-believe ,</l>
      <l n="220">You 'll twice despise what you 'd deceive .</l>
      <l n="221">I send the books . Dear Child , adieu !</l>

      <l n="553">With honour , in an equal field .</l>

      <l n="566">His wit , the timely truth that laugh 'd</l>
      <l n="567">To find itself so well express 'd ;</l>
      <l n="568">His words , abundant yet the best ;</l>
      <l n="569">His spirit , of such handsome show</l>

      <l n="571">His bearing , prospects , birth , all these</l>
      <l n="572">Might well , with small suit , greatly please ;</l>
      <l n="573">How greatly , when she saw arise</l>

      <l n="578">Which women can no more withstand</l>
      <l n="579">Than we their grace , were still unquell 'd ,</l>

      <l n="588">Death to repel her , truth and ease</l>

      <l n="601">Itself to bread ; enough thereof</l>

     <lg type="stanza" n="11">
      <l n="839">I thought the worst had brought me balm :</l>
      <l n="840">‘ Twas but the tempest 's central calm .</l>
      <l n="841">Vague sinkings of the heart aver</l>
      <l n="842">That dreadful wrong is come to her ,</l>
      <l n="843">And o'er this dream I brood and dote ,</l>
      <l n="844">And learn its agonies by rote .</l>
      <l n="845">As if I loved it , early and late</l>
      <l n="846">I make familiar with my fate ,</l>
      <l n="847">And feed , with fascinated will ,</l>
      <l n="848">On very dregs of finish 'd ill .</l>
      <l n="849">I think , she 's near him now , alone ,</l>
      <l n="850">With wardship and protection none ;</l>
      <l n="851">Alone , perhaps , in the hindering stress</l>
      <l n="852">Of airs that clasp him with her dress ,</l>
      <l n="853">They wander whispering by the wave ;</l>
      <l n="854">And haply now , in some sea-cave ,</l>
      <l n="855">Where the ribb 'd sand is rarely trod ,</l>
      <l n="856">They laugh , they kiss , Oh , God ! oh , God !</l>
      <l n="857">There comes a smile acutely sweet</l>
      <l n="858">Out of the picturing dark ; I meet</l>
      <l n="859">The ancient frankness of her gaze ,</l>
      <l n="860">That soft and heart-surprising blaze</l>
      <l n="861">Of great goodwill and innocence .</l>
      <l n="862">And perfect joy proceeding thence !</l>
      <l n="863">Ah ! made for earth 's delight , yet such</l>
      <l n="864">The mid-sea air 's too gross to touch .</l>
      <l n="865">At thought of which , the soul in me</l>
      <l n="866">Is as the bird that bites a bee ,</l>
      <l n="867">And darts abroad on frantic wing ,</l>
      <l n="868">Tasting the honey and the sting ;</l>
      <l n="869">And , moaning where all round me sleep</l>
      <l n="870">Amidst the moaning of the deep ,</l>
      <l n="871">I start at midnight from my bed —</l>
      <l n="872">And have no right to strike him dead .</l>
      <l n="873">What world is this that I am in ,</l>
      <l n="874">Where chance turns sanctity to sin !</l>
      <l n="875">‘ Tis crime henceforward to desire</l>
      <l n="876">The only good ; the sacred fire</l>
      <l n="877">That sunn 'd the universe is hell !</l>
      <l n="878">I hear a Voice which argues well :</l>
      <l n="879">‘ The Heaven hard has scorn 'd your cry ;</l>
      <l n="880">Fall down and worship me , and I</l>
      <l n="881">Will give you peace ; go and profane</l>
      <l n="882">This pangful love , so pure , so vain .</l>
      <l n="883">And thereby win forgetfulness</l>
      <l n="884">And pardon of the spirit 's excess ,</l>
      <l n="885">Which soar 'd too nigh that jealous Heaven</l>
      <l n="886">Ever , save thus , to be forgiven .</l>
      <l n="887">No Gospel has come down that cures</l>
      <l n="888">With better gain a loss like yours .</l>
      <l n="889">Be pious ! Give the beggar pelf ,</l>
      <l n="890">And love your neighbour as yourself !</l>
      <l n="891">You , who yet love , though all is o'er ,</l>
      <l n="892">And she 'll ne'er be your neighbour more ,</l>
      <l n="893">With soul which can in pity smile</l>
      <l n="894">That aught with such a measure vile</l>
      <l n="895">As self should be at all named “ love ! ”</l>
      <l n="896">Your sanctity the priests reprove ;</l>
      <l n="897">Your case of grief they wholly miss ;</l>
      <l n="898">The Man of Sorrows names not this .</l>
      <l n="899">The years , they say , graft love divine</l>
      <l n="900">On the lopp 'd stock of love like thine ;</l>
      <l n="901">The wild tree dies not , but converts .</l>
      <l n="902">So be it ; but the lopping hurts ,</l>
      <l n="903">The graft takes tardily ! Men stanch</l>
      <l n="904">Meantime with earth the bleeding branch .</l>
      <l n="905">There 's nothing heals one woman 's loss ,</l>
      <l n="906">And lightens life 's eternal cross</l>
      <l n="907">With intermission of sound rest ,</l>
      <l n="908">Like lying in another 's breast .</l>
      <l n="909">The cure is , to your thinking , low !</l>
      <l n="910">Is not life all , henceforward , so ? ’</l>
      <l n="911">Ill Voice , at least thou calm'st my mood :</l>
      <l n="912">I 'll sleep ! But , as I thus conclude ,</l>
      <l n="913">The intrusions of her grace dispel</l>
      <l n="914">The comfortable glooms of hell .</l>
      <l n="915">A wonder ! Ere these lines were dried ,</l>
      <l n="916">Vaughan and my Love , his three-days ’ Bride ,</l>
      <l n="917">Became my guests . I look 'd , and , lo ,</l>
      <l n="918">In beauty soft as is the snow</l>
      <l n="919">And powerful as the avalanche ,</l>
      <l n="920">She lit the deck . The Heav'nhYpppHeNsent chance !</l>
      <l n="921">She smiled , surprised . They came to see</l>
      <l n="922">The ship , not thinking to meet me .</l>
      <l n="923">At infinite distance she 's my day :</l>
      <l n="924">What then to him ? Howbeit they say</l>
      <l n="925">‘ Tis not so sunny in the sun</l>
      <l n="926">But men might live cool lives thereon !</l>
      <l n="927">All 's well ; for I have seen arise</l>
      <l n="928">That reflex sweetness of her eyes</l>
      <l n="929">In his , and watch 'd his breath defer</l>
      <l n="930">Humbly its bated life to her ,</l>
      <l n="931">His wife . My Love , she 's safe in his</l>
      <l n="932">Devotion ! What ask 'd I but this ?</l>
      <l n="933">They bade adieu ; I saw them go</l>
      <l n="934">Across the sea ; and now I know</l>
      <l n="935">The ultimate hope I rested on ,</l>
      <l n="936">The hope beyond the grave , is gone ,</l>
      <l n="937">The hope that , in the heavens high ,</l>
      <l n="938">At last it should appear that I</l>
      <l n="939">Loved most , and so , by claim divine ,</l>
      <l n="940">Should have her , in the heavens , for mine ,</l>
      <l n="941">According to such nuptial sort</l>
      <l n="942">As may subsist in the holy court ,</l>
      <l n="943">Where , if there are all kinds of joys</l>
      <l n="944">To exhaust the multitude of choice</l>
      <l n="945">In many mansions , then there are</l>
      <l n="946">Loves personal and particular ,</l>
      <l n="947">Conspicuous in the glorious sky</l>
      <l n="948">Of universal charity ,</l>
      <l n="949">As Phosphor in the sunrise . Now</l>
      <l n="950">I 've seen them , I believe their vow</l>
      <l n="951">Immortal ; and the dreadful thought ,</l>
      <l n="952">That he less honour 'd than he ought</l>
      <l n="953">Her sanctity , is laid to rest ,</l>
      <l n="954">And blessing them I too am blest .</l>
      <l n="955">My goodwill , as a springing air ,</l>
      <l n="956">Unclouds a beauty in despair ;</l>
      <l n="957">I stand beneath the sky 's pure cope</l>
      <l n="958">Unburthen 'd even by a hope ;</l>
      <l n="959">And peace unspeakable , a joy</l>
      <l n="960">Which hope would deaden and destroy ,</l>
      <l n="961">Like sunshine fills the airy gulf</l>
      <l n="962">Left by the vanishing of self .</l>
      <l n="963">That I have known her ; that she moves</l>
      <l n="964">Somewhere all-graceful ; that she loves ,</l>
      <l n="965">And is belov 'd , and that she 's so</l>
      <l n="966">Most happy , and to heaven will go ,</l>
      <l n="967">Where I may meet with her , ( yet this</l>
      <l n="968">I count but accidental bliss ,)</l>
      <l n="969">And that the full , celestial weal</l>
      <l n="970">Of all shall sensitively feel</l>
      <l n="971">The partnership and work of each ,</l>
      <l n="972">And thus my love and labour reach</l>
      <l n="973">Her region , there the more to bless</l>
      <l n="974">Her last , consummate happiness ,</l>
      <l n="975">Is guerdon up to the degree</l>
      <l n="976">Of that alone true loyalty</l>
      <l n="977">Which , sacrificing , is not nice</l>
      <l n="978">About the terms of sacrifice ,</l>
      <l n="979">But offers all , with smiles that say ,</l>
      <l n="980">‘ Tis little , but it is for aye !</l>

     <head>XI . FROM MRS. GRAHAM .</head>
     <lg type="stanza" n="12">
      <l n="981">You wanted her , my Son , for wife ,</l>
      <l n="982">With the fierce need of life in life .</l>
      <l n="983">That nobler passion of an hour</l>
      <l n="984">Was rather prophecy than power ;</l>
      <l n="985">And nature , from such stress unbent ,</l>
      <l n="986">Recurs to deep discouragement .</l>
      <l n="987">Trust not such peace yet ; easy breath ,</l>
      <l n="988">In hot diseases , argues death ;</l>
      <l n="989">And tastelessness within the mouth</l>
      <l n="990">Worse fever shows than heat or drouth .</l>
      <l n="991">Wherefore take , Frederick , timely fear</l>
      <l n="992">Against a different danger near :</l>
      <l n="993">Wed not one woman , oh , my Child ,</l>
      <l n="994">Because another has not smiled !</l>
      <l n="995">Oft , with a disappointed man ,</l>
      <l n="996">The first who cares to win him can ;</l>
      <l n="997">For , after love 's heroic strain ,</l>
      <l n="998">Which tired the heart and brought no gain .</l>
      <l n="999">He feels consoled , relieved , and eased</l>
      <l n="1000">To meet with her who can be pleased</l>
      <l n="1001">To proffer kindness , amid compute</l>
      <l n="1002">His acquiescence for pursuit ;</l>
      <l n="1003">Who troubles not his lonely mood ;</l>
      <l n="1004">And asks for love mere gratitude .</l>
      <l n="1005">Ah , desperate folly ! Yet , we know ,</l>
      <l n="1006">Who wed through love wed mostly so .</l>
      <l n="1007">At least , my Son , when wed you do ,</l>
      <l n="1008">See that the woman equals you ,</l>
      <l n="1009">Nor rush , from having loved too high ,</l>
      <l n="1010">Into a worse humility .</l>
      <l n="1011">A poor estate 's a foolish plea</l>
      <l n="1012">For marrying to a base degree .</l>
      <l n="1013">A woman grown cannot be train 'd ,</l>
      <l n="1014">Or , if she could , no love were gain 'd ;</l>
      <l n="1015">For , never was a man 's heart caught</l>
      <l n="1016">By graces he himself had taught .</l>
      <l n="1017">And fancy not ‘ tis in the might</l>
      <l n="1018">Of man to do without delight ;</l>
      <l n="1019">For , should you in her nothing find</l>
      <l n="1020">To exhilarate the higher mind ,</l>
      <l n="1021">Your soul would deaden useless wings</l>
      <l n="1022">With wickedness of lawful things ,</l>
      <l n="1023">And vampire pleasure swift destroy</l>
      <l n="1024">Even the memory of joy .</l>
      <l n="1025">So let no man , in desperate mood ,</l>
      <l n="1026">Wed a dull girl because she 's good .</l>
      <l n="1027">All virtues in his wife soon dim ,</l>
      <l n="1028">Except the power of pleasing him ,</l>
      <l n="1029">Which may small virtue be , or none !</l>
      <l n="1030">I know my just and tender Son ,</l>
      <l n="1031">To whom the dangerous grace is given</l>
      <l n="1032">That scorns a good which is not heaven ;</l>
      <l n="1033">My Child , who used to sit and sigh</l>
      <l n="1034">Under the bright , ideal sky ,</l>
      <l n="1035">And pass , to spare the farmer 's wheat ,</l>
      <l n="1036">The poppy and the meadow-sweet !</l>
      <l n="1037">He would not let his wife 's heart ache</l>
      <l n="1038">For what was mainly his mistake ;</l>
      <l n="1039">But , having err 'd so , all his force</l>
      <l n="1040">Would fix upon the hard , right course .</l>
      <l n="1041">She 's graceless , say , yet good and true ,</l>
      <l n="1042">And therefore inly fair , and , through</l>
      <l n="1043">The veils which inward beauty fold ,</l>
      <l n="1044">Faith can her loveliness behold .</l>
      <l n="1045">Ah , that 's soon tired ; faith falls away</l>
      <l n="1046">Without the ceremonial stay</l>
      <l n="1047">Of outward loveliness and awe .</l>
      <l n="1048">The weightier matters of the law</l>
      <l n="1049">She pays : mere mint and cumin not ;</l>
      <l n="1050">And , in the road that she was taught ,</l>
      <l n="1051">She treads , and takes for granted still</l>
      <l n="1052">Nature 's immedicable ill ;</l>
      <l n="1053">So never wears within her eyes</l>
      <l n="1054">A false report of paradise ,</l>
      <l n="1055">Nor ever modulates her mirth</l>
      <l n="1056">With vain compassion of the earth ,</l>
      <l n="1057">Which made a certain happier face</l>
      <l n="1058">Affecting , and a gayer grace</l>
      <l n="1059">With pathos delicately edged !</l>
      <l n="1060">Yet , though she be not privileged</l>
      <l n="1061">To unlock for you your heart 's delight ,</l>
      <l n="1062">( Her keys being gold , but not the right ,)</l>
      <l n="1063">On lower levels she may do !</l>
      <l n="1064">Her joy is more in loving you</l>
      <l n="1065">Than being loved , and she commands</l>
      <l n="1066">All tenderness she understands .</l>
      <l n="1067">It is but when you proffer more</l>
      <l n="1068">The yoke weighs heavy and chafes sore .</l>
      <l n="1069">It 's weary work enforcing love</l>
      <l n="1070">On one who has enough thereof ,</l>
      <l n="1071">And honour on the lowlihead</l>
      <l n="1072">Of ignorance ! Besides , you dread ,</l>
      <l n="1073">In Leah 's arms , to meet the eyes</l>
      <l n="1074">Of Rachel , somewhere in the skies ,</l>
      <l n="1075">And both return , alike relieved ,</l>
      <l n="1076">To life less loftily conceived .</l>
      <l n="1077">Alas , alas !</l>
      <l n="1078">Then wait the mood</l>
      <l n="1079">In which a woman may be woo 'd</l>
      <l n="1080">Whose thoughts and habits are too high</l>
      <l n="1081">For honour to be flattery ,</l>
      <l n="1082">And who would surely not allow</l>
      <l n="1083">The suit that you could proffer now .</l>
      <l n="1084">Her equal yoke would sit with ease ;</l>
      <l n="1085">It might , with wearing , even please ,</l>
      <l n="1086">( Not with a better word to move</l>
      <l n="1087">The loyal wrath of present love ) ;</l>
      <l n="1088">She would not mope when you were gay ,</l>
      <l n="1089">For want of knowing aught to say ;</l>
      <l n="1090">Nor vex you with unhandsome waste</l>
      <l n="1091">Of thoughts ill-timed and words ill-placed ;</l>
      <l n="1092">Nor reckon small things duties small ,</l>
      <l n="1093">And your fine sense fantastical ;</l>
      <l n="1094">Nor would she bring you up a brood</l>
      <l n="1095">Of strangers bound to you by blood ,</l>
      <l n="1096">Boys of a meaner moral race ,</l>
      <l n="1097">Girls with their mother 's evil grace .</l>
      <l n="1098">But not her chance to sometimes find</l>
      <l n="1099">Her critic past his judgment kind ;</l>
      <l n="1100">Nor , unaccustom 'd to respect ,</l>
      <l n="1101">Which men , where ‘ tis not claim 'd , neglect ,</l>
      <l n="1102">Confirm you selfish and morose ,</l>
      <l n="1103">And slowly , by contagion , gross ;</l>
      <l n="1104">But , glad and able to receive</l>
      <l n="1105">The honour you would long to give ,</l>
      <l n="1106">Would hasten on to justify</l>
      <l n="1107">Expectancy , however high ,</l>
      <l n="1108">Whilst you would happily incur</l>
      <l n="1109">Compulsion to keep up with her .</l>

     <head>XII . FROM FREDERICK .</head>
     <lg type="stanza" n="13">
      <l n="1110">Your letter , Mother , bears the date</l>
      <l n="1111">Of six months back , and comes too late .</l>
      <l n="1112">My Love , past all conceiving lost ,</l>
      <l n="1113">A change seem 'd good , at any cost ,</l>
      <l n="1114">From lonely , stupid , silent grief ,</l>
      <l n="1115">Vain , objectless , beyond relief ,</l>
      <l n="1116">And , like a sea-fog , settled dense</l>
      <l n="1117">On fancy , feeling , thought , and sense .</l>
      <l n="1118">I grew so idle , so despised</l>
      <l n="1119">Myself , my powers , by Her unprized ,</l>
      <l n="1120">Honouring my post , but nothing more ,</l>
      <l n="1121">And lying , when I lived on shore ,</l>
      <l n="1122">So late of mornings : weak tears stream 'd</l>
      <l n="1123">For such slight came ,— if only gleam 'd ,</l>
      <l n="1124">Remotely , beautifully bright ,</l>
      <l n="1125">On clouded eves at sea , the light</l>
      <l n="1126">Of English headlands in the sun ,—</l>
      <l n="1127">That soon I deem 'd ‘ twere better done</l>
      <l n="1128">To lay this poor , complaining wraith</l>
      <l n="1129">Of unreciprocated faith :</l>
      <l n="1130">And so , with heart still bleeding quick .</l>
      <l n="1131">But strengthen 'd by the comfort sick</l>
      <l n="1132">Of knowing that She could not care ,</l>
      <l n="1133">I turn 'd away from my despair ,</l>
      <l n="1134">And told our chaplain 's daughter , Jane ,—</l>
      <l n="1135">A dear , good girl , who saw my pain ,</l>

      <l n="1137">How glad and thankful I should be</l>
      <l n="1138">If some kind woman , not above</l>
      <l n="1139">Myself in rank , would give her love</l>
      <l n="1140">To one that knew not how to woo .</l>
      <l n="1141">Whereat she , without more ado ,</l>
      <l n="1142">Blush 'd , spoke of love return 'd , and closed</l>
      <l n="1143">With what I meant to have proposed .</l>
      <l n="1144">And , trust me , Mother , I and Jane ,</l>
      <l n="1145">We suit each other well . My gain</l>
      <l n="1146">Is very great in this good Wife ,</l>
      <l n="1147">To whom I 'm bound , for natural life ,</l>
      <l n="1148">By hearty faith , yet crossing not</l>
      <l n="1149">My faith towards — I know not what !</l>
      <l n="1150">As to the ether is the air ,</l>
      <l n="1151">Is her good to Honoria 's fair ;</l>
      <l n="1152">One place is full of both , yet each</l>
      <l n="1153">Lies quite beyond the other 's reach</l>
      <l n="1154">And recognition .</l>
      <l n="1155">If you say ,</l>
      <l n="1156">Am I contented ? Yea and nay !</l>
      <l n="1157">For what 's base but content to grow</l>
      <l n="1158">With less good than the best we know ?</l>
      <l n="1159">But think me not from life withdrawn .</l>
      <l n="1160">By passion for a hope that 's gone ,</l>
      <l n="1161">So far as to forget how much</l>
      <l n="1162">A woman is , as merely such ,</l>
      <l n="1163">To man 's affection . What is best ,</l>
      <l n="1164">In each , belongs to all the rest ;</l>
      <l n="1165">And though , in marriage , quite to kiss</l>
      <l n="1166">And half to love the custom is ,</l>
      <l n="1167">‘ Tis such dishonour , ruin bare ,</l>
      <l n="1168">The soul 's interior despair ,</l>
      <l n="1169">And life between two troubles toss 'd ,</l>
      <l n="1170">To me , who think not with the most ;</l>
      <l n="1171">Whatever ‘ twould have been , before</l>
      <l n="1172">My Cousin 's time , ‘ tis now so sore</l>
      <l n="1173">A treason to the abiding throne</l>
      <l n="1174">Of that sweet love which I have known ,</l>
      <l n="1175">I cannot live so , and I bend</l>
      <l n="1176">My mind perforce to comprehend</l>
      <l n="1177">That He who gives command to love</l>
      <l n="1178">Does not require a thing above</l>
      <l n="1179">The strength He gives . The highest degree</l>
      <l n="1180">Of the hardest grace , humility ;</l>
      <l n="1181">The step t'ward heaven the latest trod ,</l>
      <l n="1182">And that which makes us most like God ,</l>
      <l n="1183">And us much more than God behoves ,</l>
      <l n="1184">Is , to be humble in our loves .</l>
      <l n="1185">Henceforth for ever therefore I</l>
      <l n="1186">Renounce all partiality</l>
      <l n="1187">Of passion . Subject to control</l>
      <l n="1188">Of that perspective of the soul</l>
      <l n="1189">Which God Himself pronounces good .</l>
      <l n="1190">Confirming claims of neighbourhood .</l>
      <l n="1191">And giving man , for earthly life ,</l>
      <l n="1192">The closest neighbour in a wife ,</l>
      <l n="1193">I 'll serve all . Jane be munch more dear</l>
      <l n="1194">Than all as she is much more near !</l>
      <l n="1195">I 'll love her ! Yea , and love 's joy comes</l>
      <l n="1196">Ever from self-love 's martyrdoms !</l>
      <l n="1197">Yet , not to lie for God , ‘ tis true</l>
      <l n="1198">That ‘ twas another joy I knew</l>
      <l n="1199">When freighted was my heart with fire</l>
      <l n="1200">Of fond , irrational desire</l>
      <l n="1201">For fascinating , female charms ,</l>
      <l n="1202">And hopeless heaven in Her mild arms .</l>
      <l n="1203">Nor wrong I any , if I profess</l>
      <l n="1204">That care for heaven with me were less</l>
      <l n="1205">But that I 'm utterly imbued</l>
      <l n="1206">With faith of all Earth 's hope renew 'd</l>
      <l n="1207">In realms where no short-coming pains</l>
      <l n="1208">Expectance , and dear love disdains</l>
      <l n="1209">Time 's treason , and the gathering dross ,</l>
      <l n="1210">And lasts for ever in the gloss</l>
      <l n="1211">Of newness .</l>
      <l n="1212">All the bright past seems ,</l>
      <l n="1213">Now , but a splendour in my dreams ,</l>
      <l n="1214">Which shows , albeit the dreamer wakes ,</l>
      <l n="1215">The standard of right life . Life aches</l>
      <l n="1216">To be therewith conform 'd ; but , oh ,</l>
      <l n="1217">The world 's so stolid , dark , and low !</l>
      <l n="1218">That and the mortal element</l>
      <l n="1219">Forbid the beautiful intent ,</l>
      <l n="1220">And , like the unborn butterfly ,</l>
      <l n="1221">It feels the wings , and wants the sky .</l>
      <l n="1222">But perilous is the lofty mood</l>
      <l n="1223">Which cannot yoke with lowly good .</l>
      <l n="1224">Right life , for me , is life that wends</l>
      <l n="1225">By lowly ways to lofty ends .</l>
      <l n="1226">I will perceive , at length , that haste</l>
      <l n="1227">T'ward heaven itself is only waste ;</l>
      <l n="1228">And thus I dread the impatient spur</l>
      <l n="1229">Of aught that speaks too plain of Her .</l>
      <l n="1230">There 's little here that story tells ;</l>
      <l n="1231">But music talks of nothing else .</l>
      <l n="1232">Therefore , when music breathes , I say ,</l>
      <l n="1233">( And urge my task ,) Away , away !</l>
      <l n="1234">Thou art the voice of one I knew ,</l>
      <l n="1235">But what thou say'st is not yet true ;</l>
      <l n="1236">Thou art the voice of her I loved ,</l>
      <l n="1237">And I would not be vainly moved .</l>
      <l n="1238">So that which did from death set free</l>
      <l n="1239">All things , now dons death 's mockery ,</l>
      <l n="1240">And takes its place with tunings that are</l>
      <l n="1241">But little noted . Do not mar</l>
      <l n="1242">For me your peace ! My health is high .</l>
      <l n="1243">The proud possession of mine eye</l>
      <l n="1244">Departed , I am much like one</l>
      <l n="1245">Who had by haughty custom grown</l>
      <l n="1246">To think gilt rooms , and spacious grounds ,</l>
      <l n="1247">Horses , and carriages , and hounds .</l>
      <l n="1248">Fine linen , and an eider bed</l>
      <l n="1249">As much his need as daily bread ,</l>
      <l n="1250">And honour of men as much or more .</l>
      <l n="1251">Till , strange misfortune smiting sore ,</l>
      <l n="1252">His pride all goes to pay his debts ,</l>
      <l n="1253">A lodging anywhere he gets ,</l>
      <l n="1254">And takes his family thereto</l>
      <l n="1255">Weeping , and other relics few ,</l>
      <l n="1256">Allow 'd , by them that seize his pelf ,</l>
      <l n="1257">As precious only to himself .</l>
      <l n="1258">Yet the sun shines ; the country green</l>
      <l n="1259">Has many riches , poorly seen</l>
      <l n="1260">From blazon 'd coaches ; grace at meat</l>
      <l n="1261">Goes well with thrift in what they eat ;</l>
      <l n="1262">And there 's amends for much bereft</l>
      <l n="1263">In better thanks for much that 's left !</l>
      <l n="1264">Jane is not fair , yet pleases well</l>
      <l n="1265">The eye in which no others dwell ;</l>
      <l n="1266">And features somewhat plainly set ,</l>
      <l n="1267">And homely manners leave her yet</l>
      <l n="1268">The crowning boon and most express</l>
      <l n="1269">Of Heaven 's inventive tenderness ,</l>
      <l n="1270">A woman . But I do her wrong ,</l>
      <l n="1271">Letting the world 's eyes guide my tongue !</l>
      <l n="1272">She has a handsomeness that pays</l>
      <l n="1273">No homage to the hourly gaze ,</l>
      <l n="1274">And dwells not on the arch 'd brow 's height</l>
      <l n="1275">And lids which softly lodge the light ,</l>
      <l n="1276">Nor in the pure field of the cheek</l>
      <l n="1277">Flow'rs , though the soul be still to seek ;</l>
      <l n="1278">But shows as fits that solemn place</l>
      <l n="1279">Whereof the window is the face :</l>
      <l n="1280">Blankness and leaden outlines mark</l>
      <l n="1281">What time the Church within is dark :</l>
      <l n="1282">Yet view it on a Festal night ,</l>
      <l n="1283">Or some occasion else for light ,</l>
      <l n="1284">And each ungainly line is seen</l>
      <l n="1285">A special character to mean</l>
      <l n="1286">Of Saint or Prophet , and the whole</l>
      <l n="1287">Blank window is a living scroll .</l>
      <l n="1288">For hours , the clock upon the shelf ,</l>
      <l n="1289">Has all the talking to itself ;</l>
      <l n="1290">But to and fro her needle runs</l>
      <l n="1291">Twice , while the clock is ticking once ;</l>
      <l n="1292">And , when a wife is well in reach ,</l>
      <l n="1293">Not silence separates , but speech ;</l>
      <l n="1294">And I , contented , read , or smoke ,</l>
      <l n="1295">And idly think , or idly stroke</l>
      <l n="1296">The winking cat , or watch the fire ,</l>
      <l n="1297">In social peace that does not tire ;</l>
      <l n="1298">Until , at easeful end of day ,</l>
      <l n="1299">She moves , and puts her work away ,</l>
      <l n="1300">And , saying ‘ How cold ‘ tis , ’ or ‘ How warm , ’</l>

      <l n="1307">There falls , with her thus fondly by ,</l>

      <l n="1357">His hand was worthy of a Queen 's ,</l>

      <l n="1433">Then recollects me with a smile .</l>
      <l n="1434">I wish he had that fancied Wife ,</l>
      <l n="1435">With me for Maid , now ! all my life</l>
      <l n="1436">To dress her out for him , and make</l>
      <l n="1437">Her looks the lovelier for his sake ;</l>
      <l n="1438">To have her rate me till I cried ;</l>
      <l n="1439">Then see her seated by his side ,</l>
      <l n="1440">And driven off proudly to the Ball ;</l>
      <l n="1441">Then to stay up for her , whilst all</l>
      <l n="1442">The servants were asleep ; and hear</l>
      <l n="1443">At dawn the carriage rolling near ,</l>
      <l n="1444">And let them in ; and hear her laugh ,</l>
      <l n="1445">And boast , he said that none was half</l>
      <l n="1446">So beautiful , and that the Queen ,</l>
      <l n="1447">Who danced with him the first , had seen</l>

      <l n="1454">Pray burn this letter . I would not</l>

      <l n="1457">Of people shut up in a cell ,</l>

      <l n="1459">Must never know he is loved by me</l>
      <l n="1460">The most ; he 'd think himself to blame ;</l>
      <l n="1461">And I should almost die for shame .</l>
      <l n="1462">If being good would serve instead</l>
      <l n="1463">Of being graceful , ah , then , Fred —</l>
      <l n="1464">But I , myself , I never could</l>
      <l n="1465">See what 's in women 's being good ;</l>
      <l n="1466">For all their goodness is to do</l>
      <l n="1467">Just what their nature tells them to .</l>
      <l n="1468">Now , when a man would do what 's right ,</l>
      <l n="1469">He has to try with all his might .</l>
      <l n="1470">Though true and kind in deed and word ,</l>

      <l n="1506">I hope you 're well . I write to say</l>

      <l n="1508">A good appointment in the Docks ;</l>
      <l n="1509">Also to thank you for the frocks</l>
      <l n="1510">And shoes for Baby . I , ( D. V .,)</l>
      <l n="1511">Shall soon be strong . Fred goes to sea</l>

      <l n="1517">He 's dull till he gets used again</l>
      <l n="1518">To marriage . Do not tell him , though ;</l>
      <l n="1519">I would not have him know I know ,</l>
      <l n="1520">For all the world .</l>
      <l n="1521">I try to mind</l>
      <l n="1522">All your advice ; but sometimes find</l>
      <l n="1523">I do not well see how . I thought</l>
      <l n="1524">To take it about dress ; so bought</l>
      <l n="1525">A gay new bonnet , gown , and shawl ;</l>
      <l n="1526">But Frederick was not pleased at all ;</l>
      <l n="1527">For , though he smiled , and said , ‘ How smart ! ’</l>
      <l n="1528">I feel , you know , what 's in his heart .</l>
      <l n="1529">But I shall learn ! I fancied long</l>
      <l n="1530">That care in dress was very wrong ,</l>
      <l n="1531">Till Frederick , in his startling way ,</l>
      <l n="1532">When I began to blame , one day ,</l>
      <l n="1533">The Admiral 's Wife , because we hear</l>
      <l n="1534">She spends two hours , or something near ,</l>
      <l n="1535">In dressing , took her part , and said</l>
      <l n="1536">How all things deck themselves that wed ;</l>
      <l n="1537">How birds and plants grow fine to please</l>
      <l n="1538">Each other in their marriages ;</l>
      <l n="1539">And how ( which certainly is true —</l>
      <l n="1540">It never struck me — did it you ? )</l>
      <l n="1541">Dress was , at first , Heaven 's ordinance ,</l>
      <l n="1542">And has much Scripture countenance .</l>
      <l n="1543">For Eliezer , we are told ,</l>
      <l n="1544">Adorn 'd with jewels and with gold</l>
      <l n="1545">Rebecca . In the Psalms , again ,</l>
      <l n="1546">How the King 's Daughter dress 'd ! And , then ,</l>
      <l n="1547">The Good Wife in the Proverbs , she</l>
      <l n="1548">Made herself clothes of tapestry ,</l>
      <l n="1549">Purple and silk : and there 's much more</l>
      <l n="1550">I had not thought about before !</l>
      <l n="1551">But Fred 's so clever ! Do you know ,</l>
      <l n="1552">Since Baby came , he loves me so !</l>
      <l n="1553">I 'm really useful , now , to Fred ;</l>
      <l n="1554">And none could do so well instead .</l>
      <l n="1555">It 's nice to fancy , if I died ,</l>
      <l n="1556">He 'd miss me from the Darling 's side !</l>
      <l n="1557">Also , there 's something now , you see ,</l>
      <l n="1558">On which we talk , and quite agree ;</l>
      <l n="1559">On which , without pride too , I can</l>
      <l n="1560">Hope I 'm as wise as any man .</l>
      <l n="1561">I should be happy now , if quite</l>
      <l n="1562">Sure that in one thing Fred was right .</l>
      <l n="1563">But , though I trust his prayers are said ,</l>
      <l n="1564">Because he goes so late to bed ,</l>
      <l n="1565">I doubt his Calling . Glad to find</l>
      <l n="1566">A text adapted to his mind ,—</l>
      <l n="1567">That where St. Paul , in Man and Wife ,</l>
      <l n="1568">Allows a little worldly life ,—</l>
      <l n="1569">He smiled , and said that he knew all</l>
      <l n="1570">Such things as that without St. Paul !</l>
      <l n="1571">And once he said , when I with pain</l>
      <l n="1572">Had got him just to read Romaine ,</l>
      <l n="1573">‘ Men 's creeds should not their hopes condemn .</l>
      <l n="1574">Who wait for heaven to come to them</l>
      <l n="1575">Are little like to go to heaven ,</l>
      <l n="1576">If logic 's not the devil 's leaven ! ’</l>
      <l n="1577">I cried at such a wicked joke ,</l>
      <l n="1578">And he , surprised , went out to smoke .</l>
      <l n="1579">But to judge him is not for me ,</l>
      <l n="1580">Who myself sin so dreadfully</l>
      <l n="1581">As half to doubt if I should care</l>
      <l n="1582">To go to heaven , and he not there .</l>
      <l n="1583">He must be right ; and I dare say</l>
      <l n="1584">I shall soon understand his way .</l>
      <l n="1585">To other things , once strange , I 've grown</l>
      <l n="1586">Accustom 'd , nay , to like . I own</l>
      <l n="1587">‘ Twas long before I got well used</l>
      <l n="1588">To sit , while Frederick read or mused</l>
      <l n="1589">For hours , and scarcely spoke . When he ,</l>
      <l n="1590">For all that , held the door to me ,</l>
      <l n="1591">Pick 'd up my handkerchief , and rose</l>
      <l n="1592">To set my chair , with other shows</l>
      <l n="1593">Of honour , such as men , ‘ tis true ,</l>
      <l n="1594">To sweethearts and fine ladies do ,</l>
      <l n="1595">It almost seem 'd an unkind jest ;</l>
      <l n="1596">But now I like these ways the best .</l>
      <l n="1597">They somehow make me gentle and good ;</l>
      <l n="1598">And I do n't mind his quiet mood .</l>
      <l n="1599">If Frederick does seem dull awhile ,</l>
      <l n="1600">There 's Baby . You should see him smile !</l>
      <l n="1601">I 'm pretty and nice to him , sweet Pet ,</l>
      <l n="1602">And he will learn no better yet :</l>
      <l n="1603">Indeed , now little Johnny makes</l>
      <l n="1604">A busier time of it , and takes</l>
      <l n="1605">Our thoughts off one another more ,</l>

      <l n="1714">Hungry two hours before the time .</l>
      <l n="1715">And there Jane took her stitching out ,</l>
      <l n="1716">And John for birds ’ - nests pry 'd about ,</l>
      <l n="1717">And Grace and Baby , in between</l>
      <l n="1718">The warm blades of the breathing green ,</l>
      <l n="1719">Dodged grasshoppers ; and I no less ,</l>
      <l n="1720">In conscientious idleness ,</l>
      <l n="1721">Enjoy 'd myself , under the noon</l>
      <l n="1722">Stretch 'd , and the sounds and sights of June</l>
      <l n="1723">Receiving , with a drowsy charm ,</l>
      <l n="1724">Through muffled ear and folded arm .</l>
      <l n="1725">And then , as if I sweetly dream 'd ,</l>
      <l n="1726">I half-remember 'd how it seem 'd</l>
      <l n="1727">When I , too , was a little child</l>
      <l n="1728">About the wild wood roving wild .</l>
      <l n="1729">Pure breezes from the far-off height</l>
      <l n="1730">Melted the blindness from my sight ,</l>
      <l n="1731">Until , with rapture , grief , and awe ,</l>
      <l n="1732">I saw again as then I saw .</l>
      <l n="1733">As then I saw , I saw again</l>
      <l n="1734">The harvest-waggon in the lane ,</l>
      <l n="1735">With high-hung tokens of its pride</l>
      <l n="1736">Left in the elms on either side ;</l>
      <l n="1737">The daisies coming out at dawn</l>
      <l n="1738">In constellations on the lawn ;</l>
      <l n="1739">The glory of the daffodil ;</l>
      <l n="1740">The three black windmills on the hill ,</l>
      <l n="1741">Whose magic arms , flung wildly by ,</l>
      <l n="1742">Sent magic shadows o'er the rye .</l>
      <l n="1743">Within the leafy coppice , lo ,</l>
      <l n="1744">More wealth than miser 's dreams could show ,</l>
      <l n="1745">The blackbird 's warm and woolly brood ,</l>
      <l n="1746">Five golden beaks agape for food ;</l>
      <l n="1747">The Gipsies , all the summer seen</l>
      <l n="1748">Native as poppies to the Green ;</l>
      <l n="1749">The winter , with its frosts and thaws</l>
      <l n="1750">And opulence of hips and haws :</l>
      <l n="1751">The lovely marvel of the snow ;</l>
      <l n="1752">The Tamar , with its altering show</l>
      <l n="1753">Of gay ships sailing up and down ,</l>
      <l n="1754">Among the fields and by the Town ;</l>
      <l n="1755">And , dearer far than anything ,</l>
      <l n="1756">Came back the songs you used to sing .</l>
      <l n="1757">( Ah , might you sing such songs again ,</l>
      <l n="1758">And I , your child , but hear as then ,</l>
      <l n="1759">With conscious profit of the gulf</l>
      <l n="1760">Flown over from my present self ! )</l>
      <l n="1761">And , as to men 's retreating eyes ,</l>
      <l n="1762">Beyond high mountains higher rise ,</l>
      <l n="1763">Still farther back there shone to me</l>
      <l n="1764">The dazzling dusk of infancy .</l>
      <l n="1765">Thither I look 'd , as , sick of night ,</l>
      <l n="1766">The Alpine shepherd looks to the height ,</l>
      <l n="1767">And does not see the day , ‘ tis true ,</l>
      <l n="1768">But sees the rosy tops that do .</l>
      <l n="1769">Meantime Jane stitch 'd , and fann 'd the flies</l>
      <l n="1770">From my repose , with hush 'd replies</l>
      <l n="1771">To Grace , and smiles when Baby fell .</l>
      <l n="1772">Her countenance love visible</l>
      <l n="1773">Appear 'd , love audible her voice .</l>
      <l n="1774">Why in the past alone rejoice ,</l>
      <l n="1775">Whilst here was wealth before me cast</l>
      <l n="1776">Which , I could feel , if ‘ twere but past</l>
      <l n="1777">Were then most precious ? Question vain ,</l>
      <l n="1778">When ask 'd again and yet again ,</l>
      <l n="1779">Year after year ; yet now , for no</l>
      <l n="1780">Cause , but that heaven 's bright winds will blow</l>
      <l n="1781">Not at our pray'r but as they list ,</l>
      <l n="1782">It brought that distant , golden mist</l>
      <l n="1783">To grace the hour , firing the deep</l>
      <l n="1784">Of spirit and the drowsy keep</l>
      <l n="1785">Of joy , till , spreading uncontain 'd ,</l>
      <l n="1786">The holy power of seeing gained</l>
      <l n="1787">The outward eye , this owning even</l>
      <l n="1788">That where there 's love and truth there 's heaven .</l>
      <l n="1789">Debtor to few , forgotten hours</l>
      <l n="1790">Am I , that truths for me are powers .</l>
      <l n="1791">Ah , happy hours , ‘ tis something yet</l>
      <l n="1792">Not to forget that I forget !</l>
      <l n="1793">And now a cloud , bright , huge and calm ,</l>
      <l n="1794">Rose , doubtful if for bale or balm ;</l>
      <l n="1795">O'ertoppling towers and bulwarks bright</l>
      <l n="1796">Appear 'd , at beck of viewless might .</l>
      <l n="1797">Along a rifted mountain range .</l>
      <l n="1798">Untraceable and swift in change ,</l>
      <l n="1799">Those glittering peaks , disrupted , spread</l>
      <l n="1800">To solemn bulks , seen overhead ;</l>
      <l n="1801">The sunshine quench 'd , from one dark form</l>
      <l n="1802">Fumed the appalling light of storm .</l>
      <l n="1803">Straight to the zenith , black with bale ,</l>
      <l n="1804">The Gipsies ’ smoke rose deadly pale ;</l>
      <l n="1805">And one wide night of hopeless hue</l>
      <l n="1806">Hid from the heart the recent blue .</l>
      <l n="1807">And soon , with thunder crackling loud ,</l>
      <l n="1808">A flash reveal 'd the formless cloud :</l>
      <l n="1809">Lone sailing rack , far wavering rim ,</l>
      <l n="1810">And billowy tracts of stormland dim .</l>
      <l n="1811">We stood , safe group 'd beneath a shed .</l>
      <l n="1812">Grace hid behind Jane 's gown for dread ,</l>
      <l n="1813">Who told her , fondling with her hair ,</l>
      <l n="1814">‘ The naughty noise ! but God took care</l>
      <l n="1815">Of all good girls . ’ John seem 'd to me</l>
      <l n="1816">Too much for Jane 's theology ,</l>
      <l n="1817">Who bade him watch the tempest . Now</l>
      <l n="1818">A blast made all the woodland bow ;</l>
      <l n="1819">Against the whirl of leaves and dust</l>
      <l n="1820">Kine dropp 'd their heads ; the tortured gust</l>
      <l n="1821">Jagg 'd and convuls 'd the ascending smoke</l>
      <l n="1822">To mockery of the lightning 's stroke .</l>
      <l n="1823">The blood prick 'd , and a blinding flash</l>
      <l n="1824">And close coinstantaneous crash</l>
      <l n="1825">Humbled the soul , and the rain all round</l>
      <l n="1826">Resilient dimm 'd the whistling ground ,</l>
      <l n="1827">Nor flagg 'd in force from first to last ,</l>
      <l n="1828">Till , sudden as it came , ‘ twas past ,</l>
      <l n="1829">Leaving a trouble in the copse</l>
      <l n="1830">Of brawling birds and tinkling drops .</l>
      <l n="1831">Change beyond hope ! Far thunder faint</l>
      <l n="1832">Mutter 'd its vast and vain complaint ,</l>
      <l n="1833">And gaps and fractures , fringed with light ,</l>
      <l n="1834">Show 'd the sweet skies , with squadrons bright</l>
      <l n="1835">Of cloudlets , glittering calm and fair</l>
      <l n="1836">Through gulfs of calm and glittering air .</l>
      <l n="1837">With this adventure , we return 'd .</l>
      <l n="1838">The roads the feet no longer burn 'd .</l>
      <l n="1839">A wholesome smell of rainy earth</l>
      <l n="1840">Refresh 'd our spirits , tired of mirth .</l>
      <l n="1841">The donkey-boy drew friendly near</l>
      <l n="1842">My Wife , and , touch 'd by the kind cheer</l>
      <l n="1843">Her countenance show 'd , or sooth 'd perchance</l>
      <l n="1844">By the soft evening 's sad advance ,</l>
      <l n="1845">As we were , stroked the flanks and head</l>
      <l n="1846">Of the ass , and , somewhat thick-voiced , said ,</l>
      <l n="1847">‘ To ‘ ave to wop the donkeys so</l>
      <l n="1848">‘ Ardens the ‘ art , but they wo n't go</l>
      <l n="1849">Without ! ’ My wife , by this impress 'd ,</l>
      <l n="1850">As men judge poets by their best ,</l>
      <l n="1851">When now we reach 'd the welcome door ,</l>
      <l n="1852">Gave him his hire , and sixpence more .</l>

     <head>XIX . FROM JANE .</head>
     <lg type="stanza" n="20">
      <l n="1853">Dear Mrs. Graham , the fever 's past ,</l>
      <l n="1854">And Fred is well . I , in my last ,</l>
      <l n="1855">Forgot to say that , while ‘ twas on ,</l>
      <l n="1856">A lady , call 'd Honoria Vaughan ,</l>
      <l n="1857">One of his Salisbury Cousins , came .</l>
      <l n="1858">Had I , she ask 'd me , heard her name ?</l>
      <l n="1859">‘ Twas that Honoria , no doubt ,</l>
      <l n="1860">Whom he would sometimes talk about</l>
      <l n="1861">And speak to , when his nights were bad ,</l>
      <l n="1862">And so I told her that I had .</l>
      <l n="1863">She look 'd so beautiful and kind !</l>
      <l n="1864">And just the sort of wife my mind</l>
      <l n="1865">Pictured for Fred , with many tears ,</l>
      <l n="1866">In those sad early married years .</l>
      <l n="1867">Visiting , yesterday , she said ,</l>
      <l n="1868">The Admiral 's Wife , she learn 'd that Fred</l>
      <l n="1869">Was very ill ; she begg 'd to be ,</l>
      <l n="1870">If possible , of use to me .</l>
      <l n="1871">What could she do ? Last year , his Aunt</l>
      <l n="1872">Died , leaving her , who had no want ,</l>
      <l n="1873">Her fortune . Half was his , she thought ;</l>
      <l n="1874">But he , she knew , would not be brought</l>
      <l n="1875">To take his rights at second hand .</l>
      <l n="1876">Yet something might , she hoped , be plann 'd .</l>
      <l n="1877">What did I think of putting John</l>
      <l n="1878">To school and college ? Mr. Vaughan ,</l>
      <l n="1879">When John was old enough , could give</l>
      <l n="1880">Preferment to her relative ;</l>
      <l n="1881">And she should be so pleased .— I said</l>
      <l n="1882">I felt quite sure that dearest Fred</l>
      <l n="1883">Would be most thankful . Would we come ,</l>
      <l n="1884">And make ourselves , she ask 'd , at home ,</l>
      <l n="1885">Next month , at High-Hurst ? Change of air</l>
      <l n="1886">Both he and I should need , and there</l>
      <l n="1887">At leisure we could talk , and then</l>
      <l n="1888">Fix plans , as John was nearly ten .</l>
      <l n="1889">It seemed so rude to think and doubt ,</l>
      <l n="1890">So I said , Yes . In going out ,</l>
      <l n="1891">She said , ‘ How strange of Frederick , Dear , ’</l>
      <l n="1892">( I wish he had been there to hear ,)</l>
      <l n="1893">‘ To send no cards , or tell me what</l>
      <l n="1894">A nice new Cousin I had got ! ’</l>
      <l n="1895">Was not that kind ?</l>
      <l n="1896">When Fred grew strong ,</l>
      <l n="1897">I had , I found , done very wrong .</l>
      <l n="1898">Anger was in his voice and eye .</l>
      <l n="1899">With people born and bred so high</l>
      <l n="1900">As Fred and Mrs. Vaughan and you ,</l>
      <l n="1901">It 's hard to guess what 's right to do ;</l>
      <l n="1902">And he wo n't teach me !</l>
      <l n="1903">Dear Fred wrote ,</l>
      <l n="1904">Directly , such a lovely note ,</l>
      <l n="1905">Which , though it undid all I had done ,</l>
      <l n="1906">Was , both to me and Mrs. Vaughan ,</l>
      <l n="1907">So kind ! His words . I can n't say why ,</l>
      <l n="1908">Like soldiers ’ music , made me cry .</l>

     <head>I . FROM JANE TO HER MOTHER .</head>
     <lg type="stanza" n="1">
      <l n="1">Thank Heaven , the burthens on the heart</l>
      <l n="2">Are not half known till they depart !</l>
      <l n="3">Although I long 'd , for many a year ,</l>
      <l n="4">To love with love that casts out fear ,</l>
      <l n="5">My Frederick 's kindness frighten 'd me ,</l>
      <l n="6">And heaven seem 'd less far off than he ;</l>
      <l n="7">And in my fancy I would trace</l>
      <l n="8">A lady with an angel 's face ,</l>
      <l n="9">That made devotion simply debt ,</l>
      <l n="10">Till sick with envy and regret ,</l>
      <l n="11">And wicked grief that God should e'er</l>
      <l n="12">Make women , and not make them fair .</l>
      <l n="13">That me might love me more because</l>
      <l n="14">Another in his memory was ,</l>
      <l n="15">And that my indigence might be</l>
      <l n="16">To him what Baby 's was to me ,</l>
      <l n="17">The chief of charms , who could have thought ?</l>
      <l n="18">But God 's wise way is to give nought</l>
      <l n="19">Till we with asking it are tired ;</l>
      <l n="20">And when , indeed , the change desired</l>
      <l n="21">Comes , lest we give ourselves the praise ,</l>
      <l n="22">It comes by Providence , not Grace ;</l>
      <l n="23">And mostly our thanks for granted pray'rs</l>
      <l n="24">Are groans at unexpected cares ,</l>
      <l n="25">First Baby went to heaven , you know ,</l>
      <l n="26">And , five weeks after , Grace went , too ,</l>
      <l n="27">Then he became more talkative ,</l>
      <l n="28">And , stooping to my heart , would give</l>
      <l n="29">Signs of his love , which pleased me more</l>
      <l n="30">Than all the proofs he gave before ;</l>
      <l n="31">And , in that time of our great grief ,</l>
      <l n="32">We talk 'd religion for relief ;</l>
      <l n="33">For , though we very seldom name</l>
      <l n="34">Religion , we now think the same !</l>
      <l n="35">Oh , what a bar is thus removed</l>
      <l n="36">To loving and to being loved !</l>
      <l n="37">For no agreement really is</l>
      <l n="38">In anything when none 's in this .</l>
      <l n="39">Why , Mother , once , if Frederick press 'd</l>
      <l n="40">His wife against his hearty breast ,</l>
      <l n="41">The interior difference seem 'd to tear</l>
      <l n="42">My own , until I could not bear</l>
      <l n="43">The trouble . ‘ Twas a dreadful strife ,</l>
      <l n="44">And show 'd , indeed , that faith is life .</l>
      <l n="45">He never felt this . If he did ,</l>
      <l n="46">I 'm sure it could not have been hid ;</l>
      <l n="47">For wives , I need not say to you ,</l>
      <l n="48">Can feel just what their husbands do ,</l>
      <l n="49">Without a word or look ; but then</l>
      <l n="50">It is not so , you know , with men .</l>
      <l n="51">From that time many a Scripture text</l>
      <l n="52">Help 'd me , which had , before , perplex 'd .</l>
      <l n="53">Oh , what a wond'rous word seem 'd this</l>
      <l n="54">He is my head , as Christ is his !</l>
      <l n="55">None ever could have dared to see</l>
      <l n="56">In marriage such a dignity</l>
      <l n="57">For man , and for his wife , still less ,</l>
      <l n="58">Such happy , happy lowliness ,</l>
      <l n="59">Had God himself not made it plain !</l>
      <l n="60">This revelation lays the rein —</l>
      <l n="61">If I may speak so — on the neck</l>
      <l n="62">Of a wife 's love , takes thence the check</l>
      <l n="63">Of conscience , and forbids to doubt</l>
      <l n="64">Its measure is to be without</l>
      <l n="65">All measure , and a fond excess</l>
      <l n="66">Is here her rule of godliness .</l>
      <l n="67">I took him not for love but fright ;</l>
      <l n="68">He did but ask a dreadful right .</l>
      <l n="69">In this was love , that he loved me</l>
      <l n="70">The first , who was mere poverty .</l>
      <l n="71">All that I know of love he taught ;</l>
      <l n="72">And love is all I know of aught .</l>
      <l n="73">My merit is so small by his ,</l>
      <l n="74">That my demerit is my bliss .</l>
      <l n="75">My life is hid with him in Christ ,</l>
      <l n="76">Never therefrom to be enticed ;</l>
      <l n="77">And in his strength have I such rest</l>
      <l n="78">As when the baby on my breast</l>
      <l n="79">Finds what it knows not how to seek ,</l>
      <l n="80">And , very happy , very weak ,</l>
      <l n="81">Lies , only knowing all is well ,</l>

      <l n="97">Mr. and Mrs. Frederick Graham !</l>
      <l n="98">I thought he stay 'd away for shame .</l>
      <l n="99">He and his wife were ask 'd , you know ,</l>
      <l n="100">And would not come , four years ago .</l>
      <l n="101">You recollect Miss Smythe found out</l>
      <l n="102">Who she had been , and all about</l>
      <l n="103">Her people at the Powder-mill ;</l>
      <l n="104">And how the fine Aunt tried to instil</l>
      <l n="105">Haut ton , and how , at last poor Jane</l>
      <l n="106">Had got so shy and gauche that , when</l>
      <l n="107">The Dockyard gentry came to sup ,</l>
      <l n="108">She always had to be lock 'd up ;</l>
      <l n="109">And some one wrote to us and said</l>
      <l n="110">Her mother was a kitchen-maid .</l>
      <l n="111">Dear Mary , you 'll be charm 'd to know</l>
      <l n="112">It must be all a fib . But , oh ,</l>
      <l n="113">She is the oddest little Pet</l>
      <l n="114">On which my eyes were ever set !</l>
      <l n="115">She 's so outree and natural</l>
      <l n="116">That , when she first arrived , we all</l>
      <l n="117">Wonder 'd , as when a robin comes</l>
      <l n="118">In through the window to eat crumbs</l>
      <l n="119">At breakfast with us . She has sense ,</l>
      <l n="120">Humility , and confidence ;</l>
      <l n="121">And , save in dressing just a thought</l>
      <l n="122">Gayer in colours than she ought ,</l>
      <l n="123">( To-day she looks a cross between</l>
      <l n="124">Gipsy and Fairy , red and green ,)</l>
      <l n="125">She always happens to do well .</l>
      <l n="126">And yet one never quite can tell</l>
      <l n="127">What she might do or utter next .</l>
      <l n="128">Lord Clitheroe is much perplex 'd .</l>
      <l n="129">Her husband , every now and then ,</l>
      <l n="130">Looks nervous ; all the other men</l>
      <l n="131">Are charm 'd . Yet she has neither grace ,</l>
      <l n="132">Nor one good feature in her face .</l>
      <l n="133">Her eyes , indeed , flame in her head ,</l>
      <l n="134">Like very altar-fires to Fred ,</l>
      <l n="135">Whose steps she follows everywhere</l>
      <l n="136">Like a tame duck , to the despair</l>
      <l n="137">Of Colonel Holmes , who does his part</l>
      <l n="138">To break her funny little heart .</l>
      <l n="139">Honor 's enchanted . ‘ Tis her view</l>
      <l n="140">That people , if they 're good and true ,</l>
      <l n="141">And treated well , and let alone ,</l>
      <l n="142">Will kindly take to what 's their own ,</l>
      <l n="143">And always be original ,</l>
      <l n="144">Like children . Honor 's just like all</l>
      <l n="145">The rest of us ! But , thinking so ,</l>
      <l n="146">‘ Tis well she miss 'd Lord Clitheroe ,</l>
      <l n="147">Who hates originality ,</l>
      <l n="148">Though he puts up with it in me .</l>
      <l n="149">Poor Mrs. Graham has never been</l>
      <l n="150">To the Opera ! You should have seen</l>
      <l n="151">The innocent way she told the Earl</l>
      <l n="152">She thought Plays sinful when a girl ,</l>
      <l n="153">And now she never had a chance !</l>
      <l n="154">Frederick 's complacent smile and glance</l>
      <l n="155">Towards her , show 'd me , past a doubt ,</l>
      <l n="156">Honoria had been quite cut out .</l>
      <l n="157">‘ Tis very strange ; for Mrs. Graham ,</l>
      <l n="158">Though Frederick 's fancy none can blame ,</l>
      <l n="159">Seems the last woman you 'd have thought</l>
      <l n="160">Her lover would have ever sought .</l>
      <l n="161">She never reads , I find , nor goes</l>
      <l n="162">Anywhere ; so that I suppose</l>
      <l n="163">She got at all she ever knew</l>
      <l n="164">By growing up , as kittens do .</l>
      <l n="165">Talking of kittens , by-the-bye ,</l>
      <l n="166">You have more influence than I</l>
      <l n="167">With dear Honoria . Get her , Dear ,</l>
      <l n="168">To be a little more severe</l>
      <l n="169">With those sweet Children . They 've the run</l>
      <l n="170">Of all the place . When school was done ,</l>
      <l n="171">Maud burst in , while the Earl was there ,</l>
      <l n="172">With ‘ Oh , Mama , do be a bear ! ’</l>
      <l n="173">Do you know , Dear , this odd wife of Fred</l>
      <l n="174">Adores his old Love in his stead !</l>
      <l n="175">She is so nice , yet , I should say ,</l>
      <l n="176">Not quite the thing for every day .</l>
      <l n="177">Wonders are wearying ! Felix goes</l>
      <l n="178">Next Sunday with her to the Close ,</l>
      <l n="179">And you will judge .</l>
      <l n="180">Honoria asks</l>
      <l n="181">All Wiltshire Belles here ; Felix basks</l>
      <l n="182">Like Puss in fire-shine , when the room</l>
      <l n="183">Is thus aflame with female bloom .</l>
      <l n="184">But then she smiles when most would pout ;</l>
      <l n="185">And so his lawless loves go out</l>
      <l n="186">With the last brocade . ‘ Tis not the same ,</l>
      <l n="187">I fear , with Mrs. Frederick Graham .</l>
      <l n="188">Honoria should not have her here ,—</l>
      <l n="189">And this you might just hint , my Dear ,—</l>
      <l n="190">For Felix says he never saw</l>
      <l n="191">Such proof of what he holds for law ,</l>
      <l n="192">That ‘ beauty is love which can be seen . ’</l>
      <l n="193">Whatever he by this may mean ,</l>
      <l n="194">Were it not dreadful if he fell</l>
      <l n="195">In love with her on principle !</l>

     <head>III . FROM JANE TO MRS. GRAHAM</head>
     <lg type="stanza" n="3">
      <l n="196">Mother , I told you how , at first ,</l>
      <l n="197">I fear 'd this visit to the Hurst .</l>
      <l n="198">Fred must , I felt , be so distress 'd</l>
      <l n="199">By aught in me unlike the rest</l>
      <l n="200">Who come here . But I find the place</l>
      <l n="201">Delightful ; there 's such ease , and grace ,</l>
      <l n="202">And kindness , and all seem to be</l>
      <l n="203">On such a high equality .</l>
      <l n="204">They have not got to think , you know ,</l>
      <l n="205">How far to make the money go .</l>
      <l n="206">But Frederick says it 's less the expense</l>
      <l n="207">Of money , than of sound good-sense ,</l>
      <l n="208">Quickness to care what others feel</l>
      <l n="209">And thoughts with nothing to conceal ;</l>
      <l n="210">Which I 'll teach Johnny . Mrs. Vaughan</l>
      <l n="211">Was waiting for us on the Lawn ,</l>
      <l n="212">And kiss 'd and call 'd me ‘ Cousin . ’ Fred</l>
      <l n="213">Neglected his old friends , she said .</l>
      <l n="214">He laugh 'd , and colour 'd up at this .</l>
      <l n="215">She was , you know , a flame of his ;</l>
      <l n="216">But I 'm not jealous ! Luncheon done ,</l>
      <l n="217">I left him , who had just begun</l>
      <l n="218">To talk about the Russian War</l>
      <l n="219">With an old Lady , Lady Carr ,—</l>
      <l n="220">A Countess , but I 'm more afraid ,</l>
      <l n="221">A great deal , of the Lady 's Maid ,—</l>
      <l n="222">And went with Mrs. Vaughan to see</l>
      <l n="223">The pictures , which appear 'd to be</l>
      <l n="224">Of sorts of horses , clowns , and cows</l>
      <l n="225">Call 'd Wouvermans and Cuyps and Dows .</l>
      <l n="226">And then she took me up , to show</l>
      <l n="227">Her bedroom , where , long years ago ,</l>
      <l n="228">A Queen slept . ‘ Tis all tapestries</l>
      <l n="229">Of Cupids , Gods , and Goddesses ,</l>
      <l n="230">And black , carved oak . A curtain 'd door</l>
      <l n="231">Leads thence into her soft Boudoir ,</l>
      <l n="232">Where even her husband may but come</l>
      <l n="233">By favour . He , too , has his room ,</l>
      <l n="234">Kept sacred to his solitude .</l>
      <l n="235">Did I not think the plan was good ?</l>
      <l n="236">She ask 'd me ; but I said how small</l>
      <l n="237">Our house was , and that , after all ,</l>
      <l n="238">Though Frederick would not say his prayers</l>
      <l n="239">At night till I was safe upstairs ,</l>
      <l n="240">I thought it wrong to be so shy</l>
      <l n="241">Of being good when I was by .</l>
      <l n="242">‘ Oh , you should humour him ! ’ she said ,</l>
      <l n="243">With her sweet voice and smile ; and led</l>
      <l n="244">The way to where the children ate</l>
      <l n="245">Their dinner , and Miss Williams sate .</l>
      <l n="246">She 's only Nursery-Governess ,</l>
      <l n="247">Yet they consider her no less</l>
      <l n="248">Than Lord or Lady Carr , or me .</l>
      <l n="249">Just think how happy she must be !</l>
      <l n="250">The Ball-Room , with its painted sky</l>
      <l n="251">Where heavy angels seem to fly ,</l>
      <l n="252">Is a dull place ; its size and gloom</l>
      <l n="253">Make them prefer , for drawing-room ,</l>
      <l n="254">The Library , all done up new</l>
      <l n="255">And comfortable , with a view</l>
      <l n="256">Of Salisbury Spire between the boughs .</l>
      <l n="257">When she had shown me through the house ,</l>
      <l n="258">( I wish I could have let her know</l>
      <l n="259">That she herself was half the show ;</l>
      <l n="260">She is so handsome , and so kind ! )</l>
      <l n="261">She fetch 'd the children , who had dined ;</l>
      <l n="262">And , taking one in either hand ,</l>
      <l n="263">Show 'd me how all the grounds were plann 'd .</l>
      <l n="264">The lovely garden gently slopes</l>
      <l n="265">To where a curious bridge of ropes</l>
      <l n="266">Crosses the Avon to the Park .</l>
      <l n="267">We rested by the stream , to mark</l>
      <l n="268">The brown backs of the hovering trout .</l>
      <l n="269">Frank tickled one , and took it out</l>
      <l n="270">From under a stone . We saw his owls ,</l>
      <l n="271">And awkward Cochin-China fowls ,</l>
      <l n="272">And shaggy pony in the croft ;</l>
      <l n="273">And then he dragg 'd us to a loft ,</l>
      <l n="274">Where pigeons , as he push 'd the door ,</l>
      <l n="275">Fann 'd clear a breadth of dusty floor ,</l>
      <l n="276">And set us coughing . I confess</l>
      <l n="277">I trembled for my nice silk dress .</l>
      <l n="278">I cannot think how Mrs. Vaughan</l>
      <l n="279">Ventured with that which she had on ,—</l>
      <l n="280">A mere white wrapper , with a few</l>
      <l n="281">Plain trimmings of a quiet blue ,</l>
      <l n="282">But , oh , so pretty ! Then the bell</l>
      <l n="283">For dinner rang . I look 'd quite well</l>
      <l n="284">( ‘ Quite charming , ’ were the words Fred said ,)</l>
      <l n="285">With the new gown that I 've had made</l>
      <l n="286">I am so proud of Frederick .</l>
      <l n="287">He 's so high-bred and lordly-like</l>
      <l n="288">With Mrs. Vaughan ! He 's not quite so</l>
      <l n="289">At home with me ; but that , you know ,</l>
      <l n="290">I can n't expect , or wish . ‘ Twould hurt ,</l>
      <l n="291">And seem to mock at my desert .</l>
      <l n="292">Not but that I 'm a duteous wife</l>
      <l n="293">To Fred ; but , in another life ,</l>
      <l n="294">Where all are fair that have been true ,</l>
      <l n="295">I hope I shall be graceful too ,</l>
      <l n="296">Like Mrs. Vaughan . And , now , good-bye !</l>
      <l n="297">That happy thought has made me cry ,</l>
      <l n="298">And feel half sorry that my cough ,</l>
      <l n="299">In this fine air , is leaving off .</l>

      <l n="303">The rest , touch not her beauty , young</l>
      <l n="304">Within youth which rather seems her clime ,</l>
      <l n="305">Than aught that 's relative to time .</l>
      <l n="306">How beyond hope was heard the prayer</l>
      <l n="307">I offer 'd in my love 's despair !</l>
      <l n="308">Could any , whilst there 's any woe ,</l>
      <l n="309">Be wholly blest , then she were so .</l>

      <l n="313">The depth of private joy they feel ,</l>
      <l n="314">‘ Tis not their bearing each to each</l>
      <l n="315">That does abroad their secret preach ,</l>
      <l n="316">But such a lovely good-intent</l>
      <l n="317">To all within their government</l>
      <l n="318">And friendship as , ‘ tis well discern 'd ,</l>
      <l n="319">Each of the other must have learn 'd ;</l>
      <l n="320">For no mere dues of neighbourhood</l>
      <l n="321">Ever begot so blest a mood .</l>
      <l n="322">And fair , indeed , should be the few</l>
      <l n="323">God dowers with nothing else to do ,</l>

      <l n="325">To show themselves , that all may see !</l>
      <l n="326">For alms let poor men poorly give</l>
      <l n="327">The meat whereby men 's bodies live ;</l>
      <l n="328">But they of wealth are stewards wise</l>
      <l n="329">Whose graces are their charities .</l>
      <l n="330">The sunny charm about this home</l>
      <l n="331">Makes all to shine who thither come .</l>
      <l n="332">My own dear Jane has caught its grace ,</l>
      <l n="333">And , honour 'd , honours too the place .</l>
      <l n="334">Across the lawn I lately walk 'd</l>

      <l n="336">Gentle and goddess-like of air ,</l>
      <l n="337">Honoria and some Stranger fair .</l>
      <l n="338">I chose a path unblest by these ;</l>
      <l n="339">When one of the two Goddesses ,</l>
      <l n="340">With my Wife 's voice , but softer , said ,</l>
      <l n="341">‘ Will you not walk with us , dear Fred ? ’</l>
      <l n="342">She moves , indeed , the modest peer</l>
      <l n="343">Of all the proudest ladies here .</l>
      <l n="344">Unawed she talks with men who stand</l>
      <l n="345">Among the leaders of the land ,</l>
      <l n="346">And women beautiful and wise ,</l>
      <l n="347">With England 's greatness in their eyes .</l>
      <l n="348">To high , traditional good-sense ,</l>
      <l n="349">And knowledge ripe without pretence ,</l>
      <l n="350">And human truth exactly hit</l>

      <l n="356">With reckless loyalty , dear Wife ,</l>
      <l n="357">She lays herself about my life !</l>
      <l n="358">The joy I might have had of yore</l>
      <l n="359">I have not ; for ‘ tis now no more ,</l>
      <l n="360">With me , the lyric time of youth ,</l>

      <l n="363">In my chance choice let be confess 'd</l>
      <l n="364">The tenderer Providence that rules</l>
      <l n="365">The fates of children and of fools !</l>
      <l n="366">I kiss 'd the kind , warm neck that slept ,</l>
      <l n="367">And from her side this morning stepp 'd ,</l>
      <l n="368">To bathe my brain from drowsy night</l>
      <l n="369">In the sharp air and golden light .</l>
      <l n="370">The dew , like frost , was on the pane .</l>
      <l n="371">The year begins , though fair , to wane .</l>
      <l n="372">There is a fragrance in its breath</l>
      <l n="373">Which is not of the flowers , but death ;</l>
      <l n="374">And green above the ground appear</l>
      <l n="375">The lilies of another year .</l>
      <l n="376">I wander 'd forth , and took my path</l>
      <l n="377">Among the bloomless aftermath ;</l>
      <l n="378">And heard the steadfast robin sing</l>
      <l n="379">As if his own warm heart were Spring .</l>
      <l n="380">And watch 'd him feed where , on the yew ,</l>
      <l n="381">Hung honey 'd drops of crimson dew ;</l>
      <l n="382">And then return 'd , by walls of peach ,</l>
      <l n="383">And pear-trees bending to my reach ,</l>
      <l n="384">And rose-beds with the roses gone ,</l>
      <l n="385">To bright-laid breakfast . Mrs. Vaughan</l>
      <l n="386">Was there , none with her . I confess</l>
      <l n="387">I love her than of yore no less !</l>
      <l n="388">But she alone was loved of old ;</l>
      <l n="389">Now love is twain , nay , manifold ;</l>
      <l n="390">For , somehow , he whose daily life</l>
      <l n="391">Adjusts itself to one true wife ,</l>
      <l n="392">Grows to a nuptial , near degree</l>
      <l n="393">With all that 's fair and womanly .</l>

      <l n="398">Your love lacks joy , your letter says .</l>
      <l n="399">Yes ; love requires the focal space</l>
      <l n="400">Of recollection or of hope ,</l>
      <l n="401">E'er it can measure its own scope .</l>
      <l n="402">Too soon , too soon comes Death to show</l>
      <l n="403">We love more deeply than we know !</l>
      <l n="404">The rain , that fell upon the height</l>
      <l n="405">Too gently to be call 'd delight ,</l>
      <l n="406">Within the dark vale reappears</l>
      <l n="407">As a wild cataract of tears ;</l>
      <l n="408">And love in life should strive to see</l>
      <l n="409">Sometimes what love in death would be !</l>
      <l n="410">Easier to love , we so should find .</l>
      <l n="411">It is than to be just and kind .</l>
      <l n="412">She 's gone : shut close the coffin-lid :</l>
      <l n="413">What distance for another did</l>
      <l n="414">That death has done for her ! The good</l>
      <l n="415">Once gazed upon with heedless mood ,</l>
      <l n="416">Now fills with tears the famish 'd eye ,</l>
      <l n="417">And turns all else to vanity .</l>
      <l n="418">‘ Tis sad to see , with death between ,</l>
      <l n="419">The good we have pass 'd and have not seen !</l>
      <l n="420">How strange appear the words of all !</l>
      <l n="421">The looks of those that live appal .</l>
      <l n="422">They are the ghosts , and check the breath :</l>
      <l n="423">There 's no reality but death ,</l>
      <l n="424">And hunger for some signal given</l>
      <l n="425">That we shall have our own in heaven .</l>
      <l n="426">But this the God of love lets be</l>
      <l n="427">A horrible uncertainty .</l>
      <l n="428">How great her smallest virtue seems ,</l>
      <l n="429">How small her greatest fault ! Ill dreams</l>
      <l n="430">Were those that foil 'd with loftier grace</l>
      <l n="431">The homely kindness of her face .</l>
      <l n="432">‘ Twas here she sat and work 'd , and there</l>
      <l n="433">She comb 'd and kiss 'd the children 's hair ;</l>
      <l n="434">Or , with one baby at her breast ,</l>
      <l n="435">Another taught , or hush 'd to rest .</l>
      <l n="436">Praise does the heart no more refuse</l>
      <l n="437">To the chief loveliness of use .</l>
      <l n="438">Her humblest good is hence most high</l>
      <l n="439">In the heavens of fond memory ;</l>
      <l n="440">And Love says Amen to the word ,</l>
      <l n="441">A prudent wife is from the Lord .</l>

      <l n="445">Than she herself was for her own .</l>
      <l n="446">Poor child ! Foolish it seem 'd to fly</l>

      <l n="448">When she was hurt . Now , none than all ,</l>
      <l n="449">Heart-rending and angelical</l>
      <l n="450">That ignorance of what to do ,</l>
      <l n="451">Bewilder 'd still by wrong from you :</l>
      <l n="452">For what man ever yet had grace</l>
      <l n="453">Ne'er to abuse his power and place ?</l>
      <l n="454">No magic of her voice or smile</l>
      <l n="455">Suddenly raised a fairy isle ,</l>
      <l n="456">But fondness for her underwent</l>
      <l n="457">An unregarded increment ,</l>
      <l n="458">Like that which lifts , through centuries ,</l>

      <l n="462">Dear Mother , I can surely tell ,</l>

      <l n="465">All suddenly are grown so kind .</l>
      <l n="466">Fred stopp 'd the Doctor , yesterday ,</l>
      <l n="467">Downstairs , and , when he went away ,</l>
      <l n="468">Came smiling back , and sat with me ,</l>
      <l n="469">Pale , and conversing cheerfully</l>
      <l n="470">About the Spring , and how my cough ,</l>
      <l n="471">In finer weather , would leave off .</l>
      <l n="472">I saw it all , and told him plain</l>
      <l n="473">I felt no hope of Spring again .</l>
      <l n="474">Then he , after a word of jest ,</l>
      <l n="475">Burst into tears upon my breast ,</l>
      <l n="476">And own 'd , when he could speak , he knew</l>
      <l n="477">There was a little danger , too .</l>
      <l n="478">This made me very weak and ill ,</l>
      <l n="479">And while , last night , I lay quite still ,</l>
      <l n="480">And , as he fancied , in the deep ,</l>
      <l n="481">Exhausted rest of my short sleep ,</l>
      <l n="482">I heard , or dream 'd I heard him pray :</l>

      <l n="492">The bitterest cross , it seems to me ,</l>

      <l n="508">Nay , pleased , I will , while yet I live ,</l>

      <l n="533">I saw her sobbing on the floor ,</l>
      <l n="534">Because I told her that in heaven</l>
      <l n="535">She would be as the angels even ,</l>
      <l n="536">And would not want her doll , ‘ tis true</l>
      <l n="537">A horrible fear within me grew ,</l>

      <l n="638">I used to think it strange of Him</l>

      <l n="640">Or only clear by inference :</l>

      <l n="691">As if I was some animal</l>
      <l n="692">You pitied ! Now in later life ,</l>
      <l n="693">You used me like a proper Wife .</l>
      <l n="694">You feel , Dear , in your present mood ,</l>
      <l n="695">Your Jane , since she was kind and good ,</l>
      <l n="696">A child of God , a living soul ,</l>
      <l n="697">Was not so different , on the whole ,</l>
      <l n="698">From Her who had a little more</l>
      <l n="699">Of God 's best gifts : but , oh , be sure ,</l>
      <l n="700">My dear , dear Love , to take no blame</l>
      <l n="701">Because you could not feel the same</l>
      <l n="702">Towards me , living , as when dead .</l>
      <l n="703">A hungry man must needs think bread</l>
      <l n="704">So sweet ! and , only at their rise</l>
      <l n="705">And setting , blessings , to thine eyes ,</l>
      <l n="706">Like the sun 's course , grow visible .</l>
      <l n="707">If you are sad , remember well ,</l>
      <l n="708">Against delusions of despair ,</l>
      <l n="709">That memory sees things as they were ,</l>
      <l n="710">And not as they were misenjoy 'd ,</l>
      <l n="711">And would be still , if aught destroy 'd</l>
      <l n="712">The glory of their hopelessness :</l>
      <l n="713">So that , in truth , you had me less</l>
      <l n="714">In days when necessary zeal</l>
      <l n="715">For my perfection made you feel</l>
      <l n="716">My faults the most , than now your love</l>
      <l n="717">Forgets but where it can approve .</l>
      <l n="718">You gain by loss , if that seem 'd small</l>
      <l n="719">Possess 'd , which , being gone , turns all</l>
      <l n="720">Surviving good to vanity .</l>
      <l n="721">Oh , Fred , this makes it sweet to die !</l>
      <l n="722">Say to yourself : ‘'Tis comfort yet</l>
      <l n="723">I made her that which I regret ;</l>
      <l n="724">And parting might have come to pass</l>
      <l n="725">In a worse season ; as it was ,</l>
      <l n="726">Love an eternal temper took ,</l>
      <l n="727">Dipp 'd , glowing , in Death 's icy brook ! ’</l>
      <l n="728">Or say , ‘ On her poor feeble head</l>
      <l n="729">This might have fallen : ‘ tis mine instead !</l>
      <l n="730">And so great evil sets me free</l>
      <l n="731">Henceforward from calamity .</l>
      <l n="732">And , in her little children , too ,</l>
      <l n="733">How much for her I yet can do ! ’</l>
      <l n="734">And grieve not for these orphans even ;</l>
      <l n="735">For central to the love of Heaven</l>
      <l n="736">Is each child as each star to space .</l>
      <l n="737">This truth my dying love has grace</l>
      <l n="738">To trust with a so sure content ,</l>
      <l n="739">I fear I seem indifferent .</l>
      <l n="740">You must not think a child 's small heart</l>
      <l n="741">Cold , because it and grief soon part .</l>
      <l n="742">Fanny will keep them all away ,</l>
      <l n="743">Lest you should hear them laugh and play .</l>
      <l n="744">Before the funeral 's over . Then</l>
      <l n="745">I hope you 'll be yourself again ,</l>
      <l n="746">And glad , with all your soul , to find</l>
      <l n="747">How God thus to the sharpest wind</l>
      <l n="748">Suits the shorn lambs . Instruct them , Dear ,</l>
      <l n="749">For my sake , in His love and fear .</l>
      <l n="750">And show now , till their journey 's done ,</l>
      <l n="751">Not to be weary they must run .</l>
      <l n="752">Strive not to dissipate your grief</l>
      <l n="753">By any lightness . True relief</l>
      <l n="754">Of sorrow is by sorrow brought .</l>
      <l n="755">And yet for sorrow 's sake , you ought</l>
      <l n="756">To grieve with measure . Do not spend</l>
      <l n="757">So good a power to no good end !</l>
      <l n="758">Would you , indeed , have memory stay</l>
      <l n="759">In the heart , lock up and put away</l>
      <l n="760">Relies and likenesses and all</l>
      <l n="761">Musings , which waste what they recall .</l>
      <l n="762">True comfort , and the only thing</l>
      <l n="763">To soothe without diminishing</l>
      <l n="764">A prized regret , is to match here ,</l>
      <l n="765">By a strict life , God 's love severe .</l>
      <l n="766">Yet , after all , by nature 's course ,</l>
      <l n="767">Feeling must lose its edge and force .</l>
      <l n="768">Again you 'll reach the desert tracts</l>
      <l n="769">Where only sin or duty acts .</l>
      <l n="770">But , if love always lit our path ,</l>
      <l n="771">Where were the trial of our faith ?</l>
      <l n="772">Oh , should the mournful honeymoon</l>
      <l n="773">Of death be over strangely soon ,</l>
      <l n="774">And life-long resolutions , made</l>
      <l n="775">In grievous haste , as quickly fade ,</l>
      <l n="776">Seeming the truth of grief to mock ,</l>
      <l n="777">Think , Dearest , ‘ tis not by the clock</l>
      <l n="778">That sorrow goes ! A month of tears</l>
      <l n="779">Is more than many , many years</l>
      <l n="780">Of common time . Shun , if you can ,</l>
      <l n="781">However , any passionate plan .</l>
      <l n="782">Grieve with the heart ; let not the head</l>
      <l n="783">Grieve on , when grief of heart is dead :</l>
      <l n="784">For all the powers of life defy</l>
      <l n="785">A superstitions constancy .</l>
      <l n="786">The only bond I hold you to</l>
      <l n="787">Is that which nothing can undo .</l>
      <l n="788">A man is not a young man twice ;</l>
      <l n="789">And if , of his young years , he lies</l>
      <l n="790">A faithful score in one wife 's breast ,</l>
      <l n="791">She need not mind who has the rest .</l>
      <l n="792">In this do what you will , dear Love ,</l>
      <l n="793">And feel quite sure that I approve .</l>
      <l n="794">And , should it chance as it may be ,</l>
      <l n="795">Give her my wedding-ring from me ;</l>
      <l n="796">And never dream that you can err</l>
      <l n="797">T'wards me by being good to her ;</l>
      <l n="798">Nor let remorseful thoughts destroy</l>
      <l n="799">In you the kindly flowering joy</l>
      <l n="800">And pleasure of the natural life .</l>
      <l n="801">But do n't forget your fond , dead Wife .</l>
      <l n="802">And , Frederick , should you ever be</l>
      <l n="803">Tempted to think your love of me</l>
      <l n="804">All fancy , since it drew its breath</l>
      <l n="805">So much more sweetly after death ,</l>
      <l n="806">Remember that I never did</l>
      <l n="807">A single thing you once forbid ;</l>
      <l n="808">All poor folks liked me ; and , at the end ,</l>
      <l n="809">Your Cousin call 'd me ‘ Dearest Friend ! ’</l>
      <l n="810">And , new , ‘ twill calm your grief to know ,—</l>
      <l n="811">You , who once loved Honoria so ,—</l>
      <l n="812">There 's kindness , that 's look 'd kindly on ,</l>
      <l n="813">Between her Emily and John .</l>
      <l n="814">Thus , in your children , you will wed !</l>
      <l n="815">And John seems so much comforted ,</l>
      <l n="816">( Like Isaac when his mother died</l>

      <l n="822">A strange , kind Lady watch 'd my face ,</l>

      <l n="825">Look at myself , myself no more ;</l>
      <l n="826">And bright within the mirror shone</l>
      <l n="827">Honoria 's smile , and yet my own !</l>
      <l n="828">‘ And , when you talk , I hear , ’ she sigh 'd ,</l>

      <l n="839">But for Jane 's loss , and you away ,</l>
      <l n="840">Was all a Bride from heaven could beg</l>
      <l n="841">Skies bluer than the sparrow 's egg .</l>
      <l n="842">And clearer than the cuckoo 's call ;</l>

      <l n="845">The very daisies were a show ,</l>
      <l n="846">Expanded with uncommon pride ,</l>
      <l n="847">Like little pictures of the Bride .</l>
      <l n="848">Your Great-Niece and your Grandson were</l>

      <l n="850">How well Honoria 's girls turn out ,</l>
      <l n="851">Although they never go about !</l>
      <l n="852">Dear me , what trouble and expense</l>

      <l n="854">Hers greet mankind as I 've heard say</l>
      <l n="855">That wild things do , where beasts of prey</l>
      <l n="856">Were never known , nor any men</l>
      <l n="857">Have met their fearless eyes till then .</l>
      <l n="858">Their grave , inquiring trust to find</l>
      <l n="859">All creatures of their simple kind</l>
      <l n="860">Quite disconcerts bold coxcombry ,</l>
      <l n="861">And makes less perfect candour shy .</l>
      <l n="862">Ah , Mrs. Graham ! people may scoff ,</l>

      <l n="864">How Hymen hastens to unband</l>

      <l n="915">Knew much too well to ask her why .</l>
      <l n="916">This marrying of Nieces daunts</l>
      <l n="917">The bravest souls of maiden Aunts .</l>
      <l n="918">Though Sisters ’ children often blend</l>
      <l n="919">Sweetly the bonds of child and friend ,</l>

      <l n="990">Narrow am I and want the art</l>
      <l n="991">To love two things with all my heart .</l>
      <l n="992">Occupied singly in His search ,</l>
      <l n="993">Who , in the Mysteries of the Church ,</l>
      <l n="994">Returns , and calls them Clouds of Heaven ,</l>
      <l n="995">I tread a road , straight , hard , and even ;</l>
      <l n="996">But fear to wander all confused ,</l>
      <l n="997">By two-fold fealty abused .</l>
      <l n="998">Either should I the one forget ,</l>
      <l n="999">Or scantly pay the other 's debt .</l>
      <l n="1000">You bid me , Father , count the cost .</l>
      <l n="1001">I have ; and all that must be lost</l>
      <l n="1002">I feel as only woman can .</l>
      <l n="1003">To make the heart 's wealth of some man ,</l>
      <l n="1004">And through the untender world to move ,</l>
      <l n="1005">Wrapt safe in his superior love ,</l>
      <l n="1006">How sweet ! How sweet the household round</l>
      <l n="1007">Of duties , and their narrow bound ,</l>
      <l n="1008">So plain , that to transgress were hard ,</l>
      <l n="1009">Yet full of manifest reward !</l>
      <l n="1010">The charities not marr 'd , like mine ,</l>
      <l n="1011">With chance of thwarting laws divine ;</l>
      <l n="1012">The world 's regards and just delight</l>
      <l n="1013">In one that 's clearly , kindly right ,</l>
      <l n="1014">How sweet ! Dear Father , I endure ,</l>
      <l n="1015">Not without sharp regret , be sure ,</l>
      <l n="1016">To give up such glad certainty ,</l>
      <l n="1017">For what , perhaps , may never be .</l>
      <l n="1018">For nothing of my state I know ,</l>
      <l n="1019">But that t'ward heaven I seem to go ,</l>
      <l n="1020">As one who fondly landward hies</l>
      <l n="1021">Along a deck that seaward flies .</l>
      <l n="1022">With every year , meantime , some grace</l>
      <l n="1023">Of earthly happiness gives place</l>
      <l n="1024">To humbling ills , the very charms</l>
      <l n="1025">Of youth being counted , henceforth , harms :</l>
      <l n="1026">To blush already seems absurd ;</l>
      <l n="1027">Nor know I whether I should herd</l>
      <l n="1028">With girls or wives , or sadlier balk</l>
      <l n="1029">Maids ’ merriment or matrons ’ talk .</l>
      <l n="1030">But strait 's the gate of life ! O'er late ,</l>
      <l n="1031">Besides , ‘ twere now to change my fate :</l>
      <l n="1032">For flowers and fruit of love to form ,</l>
      <l n="1033">It must he Spring as well as warm .</l>
      <l n="1034">The world 's delight my soul dejects .</l>
      <l n="1035">Revenging all my disrespects</l>
      <l n="1036">Of old , with incapacity</l>
      <l n="1037">To chime with even its harmless glee ,</l>
      <l n="1038">Which sounds , from fields beyond my range ,</l>
      <l n="1039">Like fairies ’ music , thin and strange .</l>
      <l n="1040">With something like remorse , I grant</l>
      <l n="1041">The world has beauty which I want ;</l>
      <l n="1042">And if , instead of judging it ,</l>
      <l n="1043">I at its Council chance to sit ,</l>
      <l n="1044">Or at its gay and order 'd Feast ,</l>
      <l n="1045">My place seems lower than the least</l>
      <l n="1046">The conscience of the life to be</l>
      <l n="1047">Smiles me with inefficiency ,</l>
      <l n="1048">And makes me all unfit to bless</l>
      <l n="1049">With comfortable earthliness</l>
      <l n="1050">The rest-desiring brain of man .</l>
      <l n="1051">Finally , them , I fix my plan</l>
      <l n="1052">To dwell with Him that dwells apart</l>
      <l n="1053">In the highest heaven and lowliest heart ;</l>
      <l n="1054">Nor will I , to my utter loss ,</l>
      <l n="1055">Look to pluck roses from the Cross .</l>
      <l n="1056">As for the good of human love ,</l>
      <l n="1057">‘ Twere countercheck almost enough</l>
      <l n="1058">To think that one must die before</l>
      <l n="1059">The other ; and perhaps ‘ tis more</l>
      <l n="1060">In love 's last interest to do</l>
      <l n="1061">Nought the least contrary thereto ,</l>
      <l n="1062">Than to be blest , and be unjust ,</l>
      <l n="1063">Or suffer injustice ; as they must ,</l>
      <l n="1064">Without a miracle , whose pact</l>
      <l n="1065">Compels to mutual life and act ,</l>
      <l n="1066">Whether love shines , or darkness sleeps</l>
      <l n="1067">Cold on the spirit 's changeful deeps .</l>
      <l n="1068">Enough if , to my earthly share ,</l>
      <l n="1069">Fall gleams that keep me from despair .</l>
      <l n="1070">Happy the things we here discern ;</l>
      <l n="1071">More happy those for which we yearn ;</l>
      <l n="1072">But measurelessly happy above</l>
      <l n="1073">All else are those we guess not of !</l>

     <head>XII . FROM FELIX TO HONORIA .</head>
     <lg type="stanza" n="12">
      <l n="1074">Dearest , my Love and Wife , ‘ tis long</l>
      <l n="1075">Ago I closed the unfinish 'd song</l>
      <l n="1076">Which never could be finish 'd ; nor</l>
      <l n="1077">Will ever Poet utter more</l>
      <l n="1078">Of Love than I did , watching well</l>
      <l n="1079">To lure to speech the unspeakable !</l>
      <l n="1080">‘ Why , having won her , do I woo ? ’</l>
      <l n="1081">That final strain to the last height flew</l>
      <l n="1082">Of written joy , which wants the smile</l>
      <l n="1083">And voice that are , indeed , the while</l>
      <l n="1084">They last , the very things you speak ,</l>
      <l n="1085">Honoria , who mak'st music weak</l>
      <l n="1086">With ways that say , ‘ Shall I not be</l>
      <l n="1087">As kind to all as Heaven to me ? ’</l>
      <l n="1088">And yet , ah , twenty-fold my Bride !</l>
      <l n="1089">Rising , this twentieth festal-tide ,</l>
      <l n="1090">You still soft sleeping , on this day</l>
      <l n="1091">Of days , some words I long to say ,</l>
      <l n="1092">Some words superfluously sweet</l>
      <l n="1093">Of fresh assurance , thus to greet</l>
      <l n="1094">Your waking eyes , which never grow</l>
      <l n="1095">Weary of telling what I know</l>
      <l n="1096">So well , yet only well enough</l>
      <l n="1097">To wish for further news thereof .</l>
      <l n="1098">Here , in this early autumn dawn ,</l>
      <l n="1099">By windows opening on the lawn .</l>
      <l n="1100">Where sunshine seems asleep , though bright ,</l>
      <l n="1101">And shadows yet are sharp with night ,</l>
      <l n="1102">And , further on , the wealthy wheat</l>
      <l n="1103">Bends in a golden drowse , how sweet</l>
      <l n="1104">To sit and cast my careless looks</l>
      <l n="1105">Around my walls of well-read books ,</l>
      <l n="1106">Wherein is all that stands redeem 'd</l>
      <l n="1107">From time 's huge wreck , all men have dream 'd</l>
      <l n="1108">Of truth , and all by poets known</l>
      <l n="1109">Of feeling , and in weak sort shown ,</l>
      <l n="1110">And , turning to my heart again ,</l>
      <l n="1111">To find I have what makes them vain ,</l>
      <l n="1112">The thanksgiving mind , which wisdom sums ,</l>
      <l n="1113">And you , whereby it freshly comes</l>
      <l n="1114">As on that morning , ( can there be</l>
      <l n="1115">Twenty-two years ‘ twixt it and me ? )</l>
      <l n="1116">When , thrill 'd with hopeful love , I rose</l>
      <l n="1117">And came in haste to Sarum Close ,</l>
      <l n="1118">Past many a homestead slumbering white</l>
      <l n="1119">In lonely and pathetic light ,</l>
      <l n="1120">Merely to fancy which drawn blind</l>
      <l n="1121">Of thirteen had my Love behind ,</l>
      <l n="1122">And in her sacred neighbourhood</l>
      <l n="1123">To feel that sweet scorn of all good</l>
      <l n="1124">But her , which let the wise forfend</l>
      <l n="1125">When wisdom learns to comprehend !</l>
      <l n="1126">Dearest , as each returning May</l>
      <l n="1127">I see the season new and gay</l>
      <l n="1128">With new joy and astonishment ,</l>
      <l n="1129">And Nature 's infinite ostent</l>
      <l n="1130">Of lovely flowers in wood and mead .</l>
      <l n="1131">That weet not whether any heed ,</l>
      <l n="1132">So see I , daily wondering , you ,</l>
      <l n="1133">And worship with a passion new</l>
      <l n="1134">The Heaven that visibly allows</l>
      <l n="1135">Its grace to go about my house ,</l>
      <l n="1136">The partial Heaven , that , though I err</l>
      <l n="1137">And mortal am , gave all to her</l>
      <l n="1138">Who gave herself to me . Yet I</l>
      <l n="1139">Boldly thank Heaven , ( and so defy</l>
      <l n="1140">The beggarly soul 'd humbleness</l>
      <l n="1141">Which fears God 's bounty to confess ,)</l>
      <l n="1142">That I was fashion 'd with a mind</l>
      <l n="1143">Seeming for this great gift design 'd ,</l>
      <l n="1144">So naturally it moved above</l>
      <l n="1145">All sordid contraries of love ,</l>
      <l n="1146">Strengthen 'd in youth with discipline</l>
      <l n="1147">Of light , to follow the divine</l>
      <l n="1148">Vision , ( which ever to the dark</l>
      <l n="1149">Is such a plague as was the ark</l>
      <l n="1150">In Ashdod , Gath , and Ekron ,) still</l>
      <l n="1151">Discerning with the docile will</l>
      <l n="1152">Which comes of full persuaded thought ,</l>
      <l n="1153">That intimacy in love is nought</l>
      <l n="1154">Without pure reverence , whereas this ,</l>
      <l n="1155">In tearfullest banishment , is bliss .</l>
      <l n="1156">And so , dearest Honoria , I</l>
      <l n="1157">Have never learn 'd the weary sigh</l>
      <l n="1158">Of those that to their love-feasts went ,</l>
      <l n="1159">Fed , and forgot the Sacrament ;</l>
      <l n="1160">And not a trifle now occurs</l>
      <l n="1161">But sweet initiation stirs</l>
      <l n="1162">Of new-discover 'd joy , and lends</l>
      <l n="1163">To feeling change that never ends ;</l>
      <l n="1164">And duties which the many irk ,</l>
      <l n="1165">Are made all wages and no work .</l>
      <l n="1166">How sing of such things save to her ,</l>
      <l n="1167">Love 's self , so love 's interpreter ?</l>
      <l n="1168">How the supreme rewards confess</l>
      <l n="1169">Which crown the austere voluptuousness</l>
      <l n="1170">Of heart , that earns , in midst of wealth ,</l>
      <l n="1171">The appetite of want and health ,</l>
      <l n="1172">Relinquishes the pomp of life</l>
      <l n="1173">And beauty to the pleasant Wife</l>
      <l n="1174">At home , and does all joy despise</l>
      <l n="1175">As out of place but in her eyes ?</l>
      <l n="1176">How praise the years and gravity</l>
      <l n="1177">That make each favour seem to be</l>
      <l n="1178">A lovelier weakness for her lord ?</l>
      <l n="1179">And , ah , how find the tender word</l>
      <l n="1180">To tell aright of love that glows</l>
      <l n="1181">The fairer for the fading rose ?</l>
      <l n="1182">Of frailty which can weight the arm</l>
      <l n="1183">To lean with thrice its girlish charm ?</l>
      <l n="1184">Of grace which , like this autumn day ,</l>
      <l n="1185">Is not the sad one of decay ,</l>
      <l n="1186">Yet one whose pale brow pondereth</l>
      <l n="1187">The far-off majesty of death ?</l>
      <l n="1188">How tell the crowd , whom a passion rends ,</l>
      <l n="1189">That love grows mild as it ascends ?</l>
      <l n="1190">That joy 's most high and distant mood</l>
      <l n="1191">Is lost , not found in dancing blood ;</l>
      <l n="1192">Albeit kind acts and smiling eyes ,</l>
      <l n="1193">And all those fond realities</l>
      <l n="1194">Which are love 's words , in us mean more</l>
      <l n="1195">Delight than twenty years before ?</l>
      <l n="1196">How , Dearest , finish without wrong</l>
      <l n="1197">To the speechless heart , the unfinish 'd song ,</l>
      <l n="1198">Its high , eventful passages</l>
      <l n="1199">Consisting , say , of things like these :—</l>
      <l n="1200">One morning , contrary to law ,</l>
      <l n="1201">Which , for the most , we held in awe ,</l>
      <l n="1202">Commanding either not to intrude</l>
      <l n="1203">On the other 's place of solitude</l>
      <l n="1204">Or solitary mind , for fear</l>
      <l n="1205">Of coming there when God was near ,</l>
      <l n="1206">And finding so what should be known</l>
      <l n="1207">To Him who is merciful alone ,</l>
      <l n="1208">And views the working ferment base</l>
      <l n="1209">Of waking flesh and sleeping grace ,</l>
      <l n="1210">Not as we view , our kindness check 'd</l>
      <l n="1211">By likeness of our own defect ,</l>
      <l n="1212">I , venturing to her room , because</l>
      <l n="1213">( Mark the excuse ! ) my Birthday ‘ twas ,</l>
      <l n="1214">Saw , here across a careless chair ,</l>
      <l n="1215">A ball-dress flung , as light as air ,</l>
      <l n="1216">And , here , beside a silken couch ,</l>
      <l n="1217">Pillows which did the pressure vouch</l>
      <l n="1218">Of pious knees , ( sweet piety</l>
      <l n="1219">Of goodness made and charity ,</l>
      <l n="1220">If gay looks told the heart 's glad sense ,</l>
      <l n="1221">Much rather than of penitence ,)</l>
      <l n="1222">And , on the couch , an open book ,</l>
      <l n="1223">And written list — I did not look ,</l>
      <l n="1224">Yet just in her clear writing caught :—</l>
      <l n="1225">‘ Habitual faults of life and thought</l>
      <l n="1226">Which most I need deliverance from . ’</l>
      <l n="1227">I turn 'd aside , and saw her come</l>
      <l n="1228">Adown the filbert-shaded way ,</l>
      <l n="1229">Beautified with her usual gay</l>
      <l n="1230">Hypocrisy of perfectness ,</l>
      <l n="1231">Which made her heart , and mine no less ,</l>
      <l n="1232">So happy ! And she cried to me ,</l>
      <l n="1233">‘ You lose by breaking rules , you see !</l>
      <l n="1234">Your Birthday treat is now half-gone</l>
      <l n="1235">Of seeing my new ball-dress on . ’</l>
      <l n="1236">And , meeting so my lovely Wife ,</l>
      <l n="1237">A passing pang , to think that life</l>
      <l n="1238">Was mortal , when I saw her laugh ,</l>
      <l n="1239">Shaped in my mind this epitaph :</l>
      <l n="1240">‘ Faults had she , child of Adam 's stem .</l>
      <l n="1241">But only Heaven knew of them . ’</l>
      <l n="1242">Or thus :</l>
      <l n="1243">For many a dreadful day ,</l>
      <l n="1244">In sea-side lodgings sick she lay ,</l>
      <l n="1245">Noteless of love , nor seem 'd to hear</l>
      <l n="1246">The sea , on one side , thundering near ,</l>
      <l n="1247">Nor , on the other , the loud Ball</l>
      <l n="1248">Held nightly in the public hall ;</l>
      <l n="1249">Nor vex 'd they my short slumbers , though</l>
      <l n="1250">I woke up if she breathed too low .</l>
      <l n="1251">Thus , for three months , with terrors rife ,</l>
      <l n="1252">The pending of her precious life</l>
      <l n="1253">I watched o'er ; and the danger , at last ,</l>
      <l n="1254">The kind Physician said , was past .</l>
      <l n="1255">Howbeit , for seven harsh weeks the East</l>
      <l n="1256">Breathed witheringly , and Spring 's growth ceased ,</l>
      <l n="1257">And so she only did not die ;</l>
      <l n="1258">Until the bright and blighting sky</l>
      <l n="1259">Changed into cloud , and the sick flowers</l>
      <l n="1260">Remember 'd their perfumes , and showers</l>
      <l n="1261">Of warm , small rain refreshing flew</l>
      <l n="1262">Before the South , and the Park grew ,</l>
      <l n="1263">In three nights , thick with green . Then she</l>
      <l n="1264">Revived , no less than flower and tree ,</l>
      <l n="1265">In the mild air , and , the fourth day ,</l>
      <l n="1266">Looked supernaturally gay</l>
      <l n="1267">With large , thanksgiving eyes , that shone ,</l>
      <l n="1268">The while I tied her bonnet on ,</l>
      <l n="1269">So that I led her to the glass ,</l>
      <l n="1270">And bade her see how fair she was ,</l>
      <l n="1271">And how love visibly could shine .</l>
      <l n="1272">Profuse of hers , desiring mine ,</l>
      <l n="1273">And mindful I had loved her most</l>
      <l n="1274">When beauty seem 'd a vanish 'd boast ,</l>
      <l n="1275">She laugh 'd . I press 'd her then to me ,</l>
      <l n="1276">Nothing but soft humility ;</l>
      <l n="1277">Nor e'er enhanced she with such charms</l>
      <l n="1278">Her acquiescence in my arms .</l>
      <l n="1279">And , by her sweet love-weakness made</l>
      <l n="1280">Courageous , powerful , and glad .</l>
      <l n="1281">In a clear illustration high</l>
      <l n="1282">Of heavenly affection , I</l>
      <l n="1283">Perceived that utter love is all</l>
      <l n="1284">The same as to be rational ,</l>

      <l n="1323">My dearest Niece , I 'm charm 'd to hear</l>
      <l n="1324">The scenery 's fine at Windermere ,</l>
      <l n="1325">And glad a six-weeks ’ wife defers</l>
      <l n="1326">In the least to wisdom not yet hers .</l>
      <l n="1327">But , Child , I 've no advice to give !</l>
      <l n="1328">Rules only make it hard to live .</l>
      <l n="1329">And where 's the good of having been</l>
      <l n="1330">Well taught from seven to seventeen ,</l>
      <l n="1331">If , married , you may not leave off ,</l>
      <l n="1332">And say , at last , ‘ I 'm good enough ! ’</l>
      <l n="1333">Weeding out folly , still leave some .</l>
      <l n="1334">It gives both lightness and aplomb .</l>
      <l n="1335">We know , however wise by rule ,</l>
      <l n="1336">Woman is still by nature fool ;</l>
      <l n="1337">And men have sense to like her all</l>
      <l n="1338">The more when she is natural .</l>
      <l n="1339">‘ Tis true , that if we choose , we can</l>
      <l n="1340">Mock to a miracle the man ;</l>
      <l n="1341">But iron in the fire red hot ,</l>
      <l n="1342">Though ‘ tis the heat , the fire ‘ tis not :</l>
      <l n="1343">And who , for such a feint , would pledge</l>
      <l n="1344">The babe 's and woman 's privilege ,</l>
      <l n="1345">No duties and a thousand rights ?</l>
      <l n="1346">Besides , defect love 's flow incites ,</l>
      <l n="1347">As water in a well will run</l>
      <l n="1348">Only the while ‘ tis drawn upon .</l>
      <l n="1349">‘ Point de culte sans mystere , ’ you say ,</l>
      <l n="1350">‘ And what if that should die away ? ’</l>
      <l n="1351">Child , never fear that either could</l>
      <l n="1352">Pull from Saint Cupid 's face the hood .</l>
      <l n="1353">The follies natural to each</l>
      <l n="1354">Surpass the other 's moral reach .</l>
      <l n="1355">Just think how men , with sword and gun ,</l>
      <l n="1356">Will really fight , and never run ;</l>
      <l n="1357">And all in sport : they would have died ,</l>
      <l n="1358">For sixpence more , on the other side !</l>
      <l n="1359">A woman 's heart must ever warm</l>
      <l n="1360">At such odd ways : and so we charm</l>
      <l n="1361">By strangeness which , the more they mark ,</l>
      <l n="1362">The more men get into the dark .</l>
      <l n="1363">The marvel , by familiar life ,</l>
      <l n="1364">Grows , and attaches to the wife</l>
      <l n="1365">By whom it grows . Thus , silly Girl ,</l>
      <l n="1366">To John you 'll always be the pearl</l>
      <l n="1367">In the oyster of the universe ;</l>
      <l n="1368">And , though in time he 'll treat you worse ,</l>
      <l n="1369">He 'll love you more , you need not doubt ,</l>
      <l n="1370">And never , never find you out !</l>
      <l n="1371">My Dear , I know that dreadful thought</l>
      <l n="1372">That you 've been kinder than you ought .</l>
      <l n="1373">It almost makes you hate him ! Yet</l>
      <l n="1374">‘ Tis wonderful how men forget ,</l>
      <l n="1375">And how a merciful Providence</l>
      <l n="1376">Deprives our husbands of all sense</l>
      <l n="1377">Of kindness past , and makes them deem</l>
      <l n="1378">We always were what now we seem .</l>
      <l n="1379">For their own good we must , you know</l>
      <l n="1380">However plain the way we go ,</l>
      <l n="1381">Still make it strange with stratagem ;</l>
      <l n="1382">And instinct tells us that , to them ,</l>
      <l n="1383">‘ Tis always right to bate their price .</l>
      <l n="1384">Yet I must say they 're rather nice ,</l>
      <l n="1385">And , oh , so easily taken in</l>
      <l n="1386">To cheat them almost seems a sin !</l>
      <l n="1387">And , Dearest , ‘ twould be most unfair</l>
      <l n="1388">To John your feelings to compare</l>
      <l n="1389">With his , or any man 's ; for she</l>
      <l n="1390">Who loves at all loves always ; he ,</l>
      <l n="1391">Who loves far more , loves yet by fits ,</l>
      <l n="1392">And , when the wayward wind remits</l>
      <l n="1393">To blow , his feelings faint and drop</l>
      <l n="1394">Like forge-flames when the bellows stop .</l>
      <l n="1395">Such things do n't trouble you at all</l>
      <l n="1396">When once you know they 're natural .</l>
      <l n="1397">My love to John ; and , pray , my Dear ,</l>
      <l n="1398">Do n't let me see you for a year ;</l>
      <l n="1399">Unless , indeed , ere then you 've learn 'd</l>
      <l n="1400">That Beauties wed are blossoms turn 'd</l>
      <l n="1401">To unripe codlings , meant to dwell</l>
      <l n="1402">In modest shadow hidden well ,</l>
      <l n="1403">Till this green stage again permute</l>
      <l n="1404">To glow of flowers with good of fruit .</l>
      <l n="1405">I will not have my patience tried</l>
      <l n="1406">By your absurd new-married pride ,</l>
      <l n="1407">That scorns the world 's slow-gather 'd sense</l>
      <l n="1408">Ties up the hands of Providence ,</l>
      <l n="1409">Rules babes , before there 's hope of one ,</l>
      <l n="1410">Better than mothers e'er have done ,</l>
      <l n="1411">And , for your poor particular ,</l>
      <l n="1412">Neglects delights and graces far</l>
      <l n="1413">Beyond your crude and thin conceit .</l>
      <l n="1414">Age has romance almost as sweet</l>
      <l n="1415">And much more generous than this</l>
      <l n="1416">Of yours and John 's . With all the bliss</l>
      <l n="1417">Of the evenings when you coo 'd with him</l>
      <l n="1418">And upset home for your sole whim ,</l>
      <l n="1419">You might have envied , were you wise ,</l>
      <l n="1420">The tears within your Mother 's eyes ,</l>
      <l n="1421">Which , I dare say , you did not see .</l>
      <l n="1422">But let that pass ! Yours yet will be ,</l>
      <l n="1423">I hope , as happy , kind , and true</l>
      <l n="1424">As lives which now seem void to you .</l>
      <l n="1425">Have you not seen shop-painters paste</l>
      <l n="1426">Their gold in sheets , then rub to waste</l>
      <l n="1427">Full half , and , lo , you read the name ?</l>
      <l n="1428">Well , Time , my Dear , does much the same</l>
      <l n="1429">With this unmeaning glare of love .</l>
      <l n="1430">But , though you yet may much improve ,</l>
      <l n="1431">In marriage , be it still confess 'd ,</l>
      <l n="1432">There 's little merit at the best .</l>
      <l n="1433">Some half-a-dozen lives , indeed ,</l>
      <l n="1434">Which else would not have had the need ,</l>
      <l n="1435">Get food and nurture as the price</l>
      <l n="1436">Of antedated Paradise ;</l>
      <l n="1437">But what 's that to the varied want</l>
      <l n="1438">Succour 'd by Mary , your dear Aunt ,</l>
      <l n="1439">Who put the bridal crown thrice by ,</l>
      <l n="1440">For that of which virginity ,</l>
      <l n="1441">So used , has hope ? She sends her love ,</l>
      <l n="1442">As usual with a proof thereof —</l>
      <l n="1443">Papa 's discourse , which you , no doubt ,</l>
      <l n="1444">Heard none of , neatly copied out</l>
      <l n="1445">Whilst we were dancing . All are well ,</l>

    <head>AMELIA .</head>
     <l n="1">Whene'er mine eyes do my Amelia greet</l>
     <l n="2">It is with such emotion</l>
     <l n="3">As when , in childhood , turning a dim street ,</l>
     <l n="4">I first beheld the ocean .</l>
     <l n="5">There , where the little , bright , surf-breathing town ,</l>
     <l n="6">That shew 'd me first her beauty and the sea ,</l>
     <l n="7">Gathers its skirts against the gorse-lit down</l>
     <l n="8">And scatters gardens o'er the southern lea ,</l>
     <l n="9">Abides this Maid</l>
     <l n="10">Within a kind , yet sombre Mother 's shade ,</l>
     <l n="11">Who of her daughter 's graces seems almost afraid ,</l>
     <l n="12">Viewing them ofttimes with a scared forecast ,</l>
     <l n="13">Caught , haply , from obscure love-peril past .</l>
     <l n="14">Howe'er that be ,</l>
     <l n="15">She scants me of my right ,</l>
     <l n="16">Is cunning careful evermore to balk</l>
     <l n="17">Sweet separate talk ,</l>
     <l n="18">And fevers my delight</l>
     <l n="19">By frets , if , on Amelia 's cheek of peach ,</l>
     <l n="20">I touch the notes which music cannot reach ,</l>
     <l n="21">Bidding ‘ Good-night ! ’</l>
     <l n="22">Wherefore it came that , till to-day 's dear date ,</l>
     <l n="23">I curs 'd the weary months which yet I have to wait</l>
     <l n="24">Ere I find heaven , one-nested with my mate .</l>
     <l n="25">To-day , the Mother gave ,</l>
     <l n="26">To urgent pleas and promise to behave</l>
     <l n="27">As she were there , her long-besought consent</l>
     <l n="28">To trust Amelia with me to the grave</l>
     <l n="29">Where lay my once-betrothed , Millicent :</l>
     <l n="30">‘ For , ’ said she , hiding ill a moistening eye ,</l>
     <l n="31">‘ Though , Sir , the word sounds hard ,</l>
     <l n="32">God makes as if He least knew how to guard</l>
     <l n="33">The treasure He loves best , simplicity . ’</l>
     <l n="34">And there Amelia stood , for fairness shewn</l>
     <l n="35">Like a young apple-tree , in flush 'd array</l>
     <l n="36">Of white and ruddy flow'r , auroral , gay ,</l>
     <l n="37">With chilly blue the maiden branch between ;</l>
     <l n="38">And yet to look on her moved less the mind</l>
     <l n="39">To say ‘ How beauteous ! ’ than ‘ How good and kind ! ’</l>
     <l n="40">And so we went alone</l>
     <l n="41">By walls o'er which the lilac 's numerous plume</l>
     <l n="42">Shook down perfume ;</l>
     <l n="43">Trim plots close blown</l>
     <l n="44">With daisies , in conspicuous myriads seen ,</l>
     <l n="45">Engross 'd each one</l>
     <l n="46">With single ardour for her spouse , the sun ;</l>
     <l n="47">Garths in their glad array</l>
     <l n="48">Of white and ruddy branch , auroral , gay ,</l>
     <l n="49">With azure chill the maiden flow'r between ;</l>
     <l n="50">Meadows of fervid green ,</l>
     <l n="51">With sometime sudden prospect of untold</l>
     <l n="52">Cowslips , like chance-found gold ;</l>
     <l n="53">And broadcast buttercups at joyful gaze ,</l>
     <l n="54">Rending the air with praise ,</l>
     <l n="55">Like the six-hundred-thousand-voiced shout</l>
     <l n="56">Of Jacob camp 'd in Midian put to rout ;</l>
     <l n="57">Then through the Park ,</l>
     <l n="58">Where Spring to livelier gloom</l>
     <l n="59">Quicken 'd the cedars dark ,</l>
     <l n="60">And , ‘ gainst the clear sky cold ,</l>
     <l n="61">Which shone afar</l>
     <l n="62">Crowded with sunny alps oracular ,</l>
     <l n="63">Great chestnuts raised themselves abroad like cliffs of bloom ;</l>
     <l n="64">And everywhere ,</l>
     <l n="65">Amid the ceaseless rapture of the lark ,</l>
     <l n="66">With wonder new</l>
     <l n="67">We caught the solemn voice of single air ,</l>
     <l n="68">‘ Cuckoo ! ’</l>
     <l n="69">And when Amelia , ‘ bolden 'd , saw and heard</l>
     <l n="70">How bravely sang the bird ,</l>
     <l n="71">And all things in God 's bounty did rejoice ,</l>
     <l n="72">She who , her Mother by , spake seldom word ,</l>
     <l n="73">Did her charm 'd silence doff ,</l>
     <l n="74">And , to my happy marvel , her dear voice</l>
     <l n="75">Went as a clock does , when the pendulum 's off .</l>
     <l n="76">Ill Monarch of man 's heart the Maiden who</l>
     <l n="77">Does not aspire to be High-Pontiff too !</l>
     <l n="78">So she repeated soft her Poet 's line ,</l>
     <l n="79">‘ By grace divine ,</l>
     <l n="80">Not otherwise , O Nature , are we thine ! ’</l>
     <l n="81">And I , up the bright steep she led me , trod ,</l>
     <l n="82">And the like thought pursued</l>
     <l n="83">With , ‘ What is gladness without gratitude ,</l>
     <l n="84">And where is gratitude without a God ? ’</l>
     <l n="85">And of delight , the guerdon of His laws ,</l>
     <l n="86">She spake , in learned mood ;</l>
     <l n="87">And I , of Him loved reverently , as Cause ,</l>
     <l n="88">Her sweetly , as Occasion of all good .</l>
     <l n="89">Nor were we shy ,</l>
     <l n="90">For souls in heaven that be</l>
     <l n="91">May talk of heaven without hypocrisy .</l>
     <l n="92">And now , when we drew near</l>
     <l n="93">The low , gray Church , in its sequester 'd dell ,</l>
     <l n="94">A shade upon me fell .</l>
     <l n="95">Dead Millicent indeed had been most sweet ,</l>
     <l n="96">But I how little meet</l>
     <l n="97">To call such graces in a Maiden mine !</l>
     <l n="98">A boy 's proud passion free affection blunts ;</l>
     <l n="99">His well-meant flatteries oft are blind affronts ,</l>
     <l n="100">And many a tear</l>
     <l n="101">Was Millicent 's before I , manlier , knew</l>
     <l n="102">That maidens shine</l>
     <l n="103">As diamonds do ,</l>
     <l n="104">Which , though most clear ,</l>
     <l n="105">Are not to be seen through ;</l>
     <l n="106">And , if she put her virgin self aside</l>
     <l n="107">And sate her , crownless , at my conquering feet ,</l>
     <l n="108">It should have bred in me humility , not pride .</l>
     <l n="109">Amelia had more luck than Millicent ,</l>
     <l n="110">Secure she smiled and warm from all mischance</l>
     <l n="111">Or from my knowledge or my ignorance ,</l>
     <l n="112">And glow 'd content</l>
     <l n="113">With my — some might have thought too much — superior age ,</l>
     <l n="114">Which seem 'd the gage</l>
     <l n="115">Of steady kindness all on her intent .</l>
     <l n="116">Thus nought forbade us to be fully blent .</l>
     <l n="117">While , therefore , now</l>
     <l n="118">Her pensive footstep stirr 'd</l>
     <l n="119">The darnell 'd garden of unheedful death ,</l>
     <l n="120">She ask 'd what Millicent was like , and heard</l>
     <l n="121">Of eyes like her 's , and honeysuckle breath ,</l>
     <l n="122">And of a wiser than a woman 's brow ,</l>
     <l n="123">Yet fill 'd with only woman 's love , and how</l>
     <l n="124">An incidental greatness character 'd</l>
     <l n="125">Her unconsider 'd ways .</l>
     <l n="126">But all my praise</l>
     <l n="127">Amelia thought too slight for Millicent</l>
     <l n="128">And on my lovelier-freighted arm she leant ,</l>
     <l n="129">For more attent ;</l>
     <l n="130">And the tea-rose I gave ,</l>
     <l n="131">To deck her breast , she dropp 'd upon the grave .</l>
     <l n="132">‘ And this was her 's , ’ said I , decoring with a band</l>
     <l n="133">Of mildest pearls Amelia 's milder hand .</l>
     <l n="134">‘ Nay , I will wear it for her sake , ’ she said :</l>
     <l n="135">For dear to maidens are their rivals dead .</l>
     <l n="136">And so ,</l>
     <l n="137">She seated on the black yew 's tortured root ,</l>
     <l n="138">I on the carpet of sere shreds below ,</l>
     <l n="139">And nigh the little mound where lay that other ,</l>
     <l n="140">I kiss 'd her lips three times without dispute ,</l>
     <l n="141">And , with bold worship suddenly aglow ,</l>
     <l n="142">I lifted to my lips a sandall 'd foot ,</l>
     <l n="143">And kiss 'd it three times thrice without dispute .</l>
     <l n="144">Upon my head her fingers fell like snow ,</l>
     <l n="145">Her lamb-like hands about my neck she wreathed .</l>
     <l n="146">Her arms like slumber o'er my shoulders crept ,</l>
     <l n="147">And with her bosom , whence the azalea breathed ,</l>
     <l n="148">She did my face full favourably smother ,</l>
     <l n="149">To hide the heaving secret that she wept !</l>
     <l n="150">Now would I keep my promise to her Mother ;</l>
     <l n="151">Now I arose , and raised her to her feet ,</l>
     <l n="152">My best Amelia , fresh-born from a kiss ,</l>
     <l n="153">Moth-like , full-blown in birthdew shuddering sweet ,</l>
     <l n="154">With great , kind eyes , in whose brown shade</l>
     <l n="155">Bright Venus and her Baby play 'd !</l>
     <l n="156">At inmost heart well pleased with one another ,</l>
     <l n="157">What time the slant sun low</l>
     <l n="158">Through the plough 'd field does each clod sharply shew ,</l>
     <l n="159">And softly fills</l>
     <l n="160">With shade the dimples of our homeward hills ,</l>
     <l n="161">With little said ,</l>
     <l n="162">We left the ‘ wilder 'd garden of the dead ,</l>
     <l n="163">And gain 'd the gorse-lit shoulder of the down</l>
     <l n="164">That keeps the north-wind from the nestling town ,</l>
     <l n="165">And caught , once more , the vision of the wave ,</l>
     <l n="166">Where , on the horizon 's dip ,</l>
     <l n="167">A many-sailed ship</l>
     <l n="168">Pursued alone her distant purpose grave ;</l>
     <l n="169">And , by steep steps rock-hewn , to the dim street</l>
     <l n="170">I led her sacred feet ;</l>
     <l n="171">And so the Daughter gave ,</l>
     <l n="172">Soft , moth-like , sweet ,</l>
     <l n="173">Showy as damask-rose and shy as musk ,</l>
     <l n="174">Back to her Mother , anxious in the dusk .</l>
     <l n="175">And now ‘ Good-night ! ’</l>
     <l n="176">Me shall the phantom months no more affright .</l>
     <l n="177">For heaven 's gates to open well waits he</l>
     <l n="178">Who keeps himself the key .</l>

    <head>THE AZALEA .</head>
     <l n="1">There , where the sun shines first</l>

     <l n="5">Last night the delicate crests of saffron bloom ,</l>

     <l n="17">It was the azalea 's breath , and she was dead !</l>
     <l n="18">The warm night had the lingering buds disclosed ,</l>
     <l n="19">And I had fall'n asleep with to my breast</l>
     <l n="20">A chance-found letter press 'd</l>
     <l n="21">In which she said ,</l>
     <l n="22">‘ So , till to-morrow eve , my Own , adieu !</l>
     <l n="23">Parting 's well-paid with soon again to meet ,</l>
     <l n="24">Soon in your arms to feel so small and sweet ,</l>
     <l n="25">Sweet to myself that am so sweet to you ! ’</l>

    <head>DEPARTURE .</head>
     <l n="1">It was not like your great and gracious ways !</l>
     <l n="2">Do you , that have nought other to lament ,</l>
     <l n="3">Never , my Love , repent</l>
     <l n="4">Of how , that July afternoon ,</l>
     <l n="5">You went ,</l>
     <l n="6">With sudden , unintelligible phrase ,</l>
     <l n="7">And frighten 'd eye ,</l>
     <l n="8">Upon your journey of so many days ,</l>
     <l n="9">Without a single kiss , or a good-bye ?</l>
     <l n="10">I knew , indeed , that you were parting soon ;</l>
     <l n="11">And so we sate , within the low sun 's rays ,</l>
     <l n="12">You whispering to me , for your voice was weak ,</l>
     <l n="13">Your harrowing praise .</l>
     <l n="14">Well , it was well ,</l>
     <l n="15">To hear you such things speak ,</l>
     <l n="16">And I could tell</l>
     <l n="17">What made your eyes a growing gloom of love ,</l>
     <l n="18">As a warm South-wind sombres a March grove .</l>
     <l n="19">And it was like your great and gracious ways</l>
     <l n="20">To turn your talk on daily things , my Dear ,</l>
     <l n="21">Lifting the luminous , pathetic lash</l>
     <l n="22">To let the laughter flash ,</l>
     <l n="23">Whilst I drew near ,</l>
     <l n="24">Because you spoke so low that I could scarcely hear .</l>
     <l n="25">But all at once to leave me at the last ,</l>
     <l n="26">More at the wonder than the loss aghast ,</l>
     <l n="27">With huddled , unintelligible phrase ,</l>
     <l n="28">And frighten 'd eye ,</l>
     <l n="29">And go your journey of all days</l>
     <l n="30">With not one kiss , or a good-bye ,</l>
     <l n="31">And the only loveless look the look with which you pass 'd :</l>

    <head>THE TOYS .</head>
     <l n="1">My little Son , who look 'd from thoughtful eyes</l>
     <l n="2">And moved and spoke in quiet grown-up wise ,</l>
     <l n="3">Having my law the seventh time disobey 'd ,</l>
     <l n="4">I struck him , and dismiss 'd</l>
     <l n="5">With hard words and unkiss 'd ,</l>
     <l n="6">His Mother , who was patient , being dead .</l>
     <l n="7">Then , fearing lest his grief should hinder sleep ,</l>
     <l n="8">I visited his bed ,</l>
     <l n="9">But found him slumbering deep ,</l>
     <l n="10">With darken 'd eyelids , and their lashes yet</l>
     <l n="11">From his late sobbing wet .</l>
     <l n="12">And I , with moan ,</l>
     <l n="13">Kissing away his tears , left others of my own ;</l>
     <l n="14">For , on a table drawn beside his head ,</l>
     <l n="15">He had put , within his reach ,</l>
     <l n="16">A box of counters and a red-vein 'd stone ,</l>
     <l n="17">A piece of glass abraded by the beach</l>
     <l n="18">And six or seven shells ,</l>
     <l n="19">A bottle with bluebells</l>
     <l n="20">And two French copper coins , ranged there with careful art ,</l>
     <l n="21">To comfort his sad heart .</l>
     <l n="22">So when that night I pray 'd</l>
     <l n="23">To God , I wept , and said :</l>
     <l n="24">Ah , when at last we lie with tranced breath ,</l>
     <l n="25">Not vexing Thee in death ,</l>
     <l n="26">And Thou rememberest of what toys</l>

     <l n="28">How weakly understood ,</l>
     <l n="29">Thy great commanded good ,</l>
     <l n="30">Then , fatherly not less</l>
     <l n="31">Than I whom Thou hast moulded from the clay</l>
     <l n="32">Thou'lt leave Thy wrath , and say ,</l>

     <l n="2">The laughing of whose eye</l>
     <l n="3">Is in man 's heart renew 'd virginity :</l>
     <l n="4">Who yet sick longing breeds</l>
     <l n="5">For marriage which exceeds</l>
     <l n="6">The inventive guess of Love to satisfy</l>
     <l n="7">With hope of utter binding , and of loosing endless dear despair ?</l>
     <l n="8">What gleams about her shine ,</l>
     <l n="9">More transient than delight and more divine !</l>
     <l n="10">If she does something but a little sweet ,</l>
     <l n="11">As gaze towards the glass to set her hair ,</l>
     <l n="12">See how his soul falls humbled at her feet !</l>
     <l n="13">Her gentle step , to go or come ,</l>
     <l n="14">Gains her more merit than a martyrdom ;</l>
     <l n="15">And , if she dance , it doth such grace confer</l>
     <l n="16">As opes the heaven of heavens to more than her ,</l>
     <l n="17">And makes a rival of her worshipper .</l>

     <l n="20">Her mere refused smile</l>
     <l n="21">Makes up the sum of that which may be lost !</l>
     <l n="22">Who is this Fair</l>
     <l n="23">Whom each hath seen ,</l>
     <l n="24">The darkest once in this bewailed dell ,</l>
     <l n="25">Be he not destin 'd for the glooms of hell ?</l>
     <l n="26">Whom each hath seen</l>
     <l n="27">And known , with sharp remorse and sweet , as Queen</l>
     <l n="28">And tear-glad Mistress of his hopes of bliss ,</l>
     <l n="29">Too fair for man to kiss ?</l>
     <l n="30">Who is this only happy She ,</l>
     <l n="31">Whom , by a frantic flight of courtesy ,</l>
     <l n="32">Born of despair</l>
     <l n="33">Of better lodging for his Spirit fair ,</l>
     <l n="34">He adores as Margaret , Maude , or Cecily ?</l>

     <l n="36">That each one heaves for Earth 's last lowlihead</l>
     <l n="37">And the Heaven high</l>
     <l n="38">Ineffably lock 'd in dateless bridal-bed ?</l>

     <l n="46">Who claims to enjoy her sacred beauty be ,</l>
     <l n="47">Not thou , but God ; and thy sick fire</l>
     <l n="48">A female vanity ,</l>
     <l n="49">Such as a Bride , viewing her mirror 'd charms ,</l>
     <l n="50">Feels when she sighs , ‘ All these are for his arms ! ’</l>
     <l n="51">A reflex heat</l>
     <l n="52">Flash 'd on thy cheek from His immense desire ,</l>
     <l n="53">Which waits to crown , beyond thy brain 's conceit ,</l>
     <l n="54">Thy nameless , secret , hopeless longing sweet ,</l>
     <l n="55">Not by-and-by , but now ,</l>

     <l n="3">( He lock 'd us in , ah , lucky-starr 'd ,)</l>
     <l n="4">A curtain 'd , front coupe .</l>
     <l n="5">The sparkling sun of August shone ;</l>
     <l n="6">The wind was in the West ;</l>
     <l n="7">Your gown and all that you had on</l>
     <l n="8">Was what became you best ;</l>
     <l n="9">And we were in that seldom mood</l>
     <l n="10">When soul with soul agrees ,</l>
     <l n="11">Mingling , like flood with equal flood ,</l>
     <l n="12">In agitated ease .</l>

     <l n="28">And show 'd perchance my pride .</l>
     <l n="29">I loved that girl , so gaunt and tall ,</l>
     <l n="30">Who whispered loud , ‘ Sweet Thing ! ’</l>
     <l n="31">Scanning your figure , slight yet all</l>
     <l n="32">Round as your own gold ring .</l>
     <l n="33">At Salisbury you stray 'd alone</l>
     <l n="34">Within the shafted glooms ,</l>
     <l n="35">Whilst I was by the Verger shown</l>
     <l n="36">The brasses and the tombs .</l>
     <l n="37">At tea we talk 'd of matters deep ,</l>
     <l n="38">Of joy that never dies ;</l>
     <l n="39">We laugh 'd , till love was mix 'd with sleep</l>
     <l n="40">Within your great sweet eyes .</l>
     <l n="41">The next day , sweet with luck no less</l>
     <l n="42">And sense of sweetness past ,</l>
     <l n="43">The full tide of our happiness</l>
     <l n="44">Rose higher than the last .</l>
     <l n="45">At Dawlish , ‘ mid the pools of brine ,</l>
     <l n="46">You stept from rock to rock ,</l>
     <l n="47">One hand quick tightening upon mine ,</l>
     <l n="48">One holding up your frock .</l>
     <l n="49">On starfish and on weeds alone</l>
     <l n="50">You seem 'd intent to be :</l>
     <l n="51">Flash 'd those great gleams of hope unknown</l>
     <l n="52">From you , or from the sea ?</l>
     <l n="53">Ne'er came before , ah , when again</l>
     <l n="54">Shall come two days like these :</l>
     <l n="55">Such quick delight within the brain ,</l>
     <l n="56">Within the heart such peace ?</l>
     <l n="57">I thought , indeed , by magic chance ,</l>
     <l n="58">A third from Heaven to win ,</l>
