     <item>Thou brave and true one ! upon whom Was laid the cross of martyrdom , How didst thou , in thy generous youth , Bear witness to this blessed truth !</item>
     <item>Thy cross of suffering and of shame A staff within thy hands became , In paths where faith alone could see The Master 's steps supporting thee .</item>

    <docDate>Yet , unforgotten where it lies , That seed of generous sacrifice , Though seeming on the desert cast , Shall rise with bloom and fruit at last .<date>1852</date>. THE HERO . The hero of the incident related in this poem was Dr. Samuel Gridley Howe , the well-known philanthropist , who when a young man volunteered his aid in the Greek struggle for independence . “ Oh for a knight like Bayard , Without reproach or fear ; My light glove on his casque of steel , My love-knot on his spear ! “ Oh for the white plume floating Sad Zutphen 's field above ,— The lion heart in battle , The woman 's heart in love ! “ Oh that man once more were manly , Woman 's pride , and not her scorn : That once more the pale young mother Dared to boast ` a man is born ’ ! “ But , now life 's slumberous current No sun-bowed cascade wakes ; No tall , heroic manhood The level dulness breaks . “ Oh for a knight like Bayard , Without reproach or fear ! My light glove on his casque of steel , My love-knot on his spear ! ” Then I said , my own heart throbbing To the time her proud pulse beat , “ Life hath its regal natures yet , True , tender , brave , and sweet ! “ Smile not , fair unbeliever ! One man , at least , I know , Who might wear the crest of Bayard Or Sidney 's plume of snow . “ Once , when over purple mountains Died away the Grecian sun , And the far Cyllenian ranges Paled and darkened , one by one ,— “ Fell the Turk , a bolt of thunder , Cleaving all the quiet sky , And against his sharp steel lightnings Stood the Suliote but to die . “ Woe for the weak and halting ! The crescent blazed behind A curving line of sabres , Like fire before the wind ! “ Last to fly , and first to rally , Rode he of whom I speak , When , groaning in his bridle-path , Sank down a wounded Greek . “ With the rich Albanian costume Wet with many a ghastly stain , Gazing on earth and sky as one Who might not gaze again . “ He looked forward to the mountains , Back on foes that never spare , Then flung him from his saddle , And placed the stranger there . “ ‘ Allah ! hu ! ’ Through flashing sabres , Through a stormy hail of lead , The good Thessalian charger Up the slopes of olives sped . “ Hot spurred the turbaned riders ; He almost felt their breath , Where a mountain stream rolled darkly down Between the hills and death . “ One brave and manful struggle ,— He gained the solid land , And the cover of the mountains , And the carbines of his band ! ”</docDate>
    <epigraph>
     <p>“ It was very great and noble , ” Said the moist-eyed listener then , “ But one brave deed makes no hero ; Tell me what he since hath been ! ”</p>
    </epigraph>
    <docTitle><titlePart>“ Still a brave and generous manhood , Still an honor without stain , In the prison of the Kaiser , By the barricades of Seine . “ But dream not helm and harness The sign of valor true ; Peace hath higher tests of manhood Than battle ever knew . “ Wouldst know him now ? Behold him , The Cadmus of the blind , Giving the dumb lip language , The idiot-clay a mind . “ Walking his round of duty Serenely day by day , With the strong man 's hand of labor And childhood 's heart of play . “ True as the knights of story , Sir Lancelot and his peers , Brave in his calm endurance As they in tilt of spears . “ As waves in stillest waters , As stars in noonday skies , All that wakes to noble action In his noon of calmness lies . “ Wherever outraged Nature Asks word or action brave , Wherever struggles labor , Wherever groans a slave ,— “ Wherever rise the peoples , Wherever sinks a throne , The throbbing heart of Freedom finds An answer in his own .</titlePart></docTitle>
    <docDate>“ Knight of a better era , Without reproach or fear ! Said I not well that Bayards And Sidneys still are here ? ”<date>1853</date>. RANTOUL . No more fitting inscription could be placed on the tombstone of Robert Rantoul than this : “ He died at his post in Congress , and his last words were a protest in the name of Democracy against the Fugitive-Slave Law . ” One day , along the electric wire His manly word for Freedom sped ; We came next morn : that tongue of fire Said only , “ He who spake is dead ! ” Dead ! while his voice was living yet , In echoes round the pillared dome ! Dead ! while his blotted page lay wet With themes of state and loves of home ! Dead ! in that crowning grace of time , That triumph of life 's zenith hour ! Dead ! while we watched his manhood 's prime Break from the slow bud into flower ! Dead ! he so great , and strong , and wise , While the mean thousands yet drew breath ; How deepened , through that dread surprise , The mystery and the awe of death ! From the high place whereon our votes Had borne him , clear , calm , earnest , fell His first words , like the prelude notes Of some great anthem yet to swell . We seemed to see our flag unfurled , Our champion waiting in his place For the last battle of the world , The Armageddon of the race . Through him we hoped to speak the word Which wins the freedom of a land ; And lift , for human right , the sword Which dropped from Hampden 's dying hand . For he had sat at Sidney 's feet , And walked with Pym and Vane apart ; And , through the centuries , felt the beat Of Freedom 's march in Cromwell 's heart . He knew the paths the worthies held , Where England 's best and wisest trod ; And , lingering , drank the springs that welled Beneath the touch of Milton 's rod . No wild enthusiast of the right , Self-poised and clear , he showed alway The coolness of his northern night , The ripe repose of autumn 's day . His steps were slow , yet forward still He pressed where others paused or failed ; The calm star clomb with constant will , The restless meteor flashed and paled . Skilled in its subtlest wile , he knew And owned the higher ends of Law ; Still rose majestic on his view The awful Shape the schoolman saw . Her home the heart of God ; her voice The choral harmonies whereby The stars , through all their spheres , rejoice , The rhythmic rule of earth and sky . We saw his great powers misapplied To poor ambitions ; yet , through all , We saw him take the weaker side , And right the wronged , and free the thrall . Now , looking o'er the frozen North , For one like him in word and act , To call her old , free spirit forth , And give her faith the life of fact ,— To break her party bonds of shame , And labor with the zeal of him To make the Democratic name Of Liberty the synonyme ,— We sweep the land from hill to strand , We seek the strong , the wise , the brave , And , sad of heart , return to stand In silence by a new-made grave ! There , where his breezy hills of home Look out upon his sail-white seas , The sounds of winds and waters come , And shape themselves to words like these . “ Why , murmuring , mourn that he , whose power Was lent to Party over-long , Heard the still whisper at the hour He set his foot on Party wrong ? “ The human life that closed so well No lapse of folly now can stain The lips whence Freedom 's protest fell No meaner thought can now profane . “ Mightier than living voice his grave That lofty protest utters o'er ; Through roaring wind and smiting wave It speaks his hate of wrong once more . “ Men of the North ! your weak regret Is wasted here ; arise and pay To freedom and to him your debt , By following where he led the way ! ”<date>1853</date>. WILLIAM FORSTER .</docDate>
    <docImprint>William Forster , of Norwich ,<country>England</country>, died in East Tennessee , in the 1st month ,<date>1854</date>, while engaged in presenting to the governors of the States of this Union the address of his religious society on the evils of slavery . He was the relative and coadjutor of the Buxtons , Gurneys , and Frys ; and his whole life , extending al-most to threescore and ten years , was a pore and beautiful example of Christian benevolence . He had travelled over Europe , and visited most of its sovereigns , to plead against the slave-trade and slavery ; and had twice before made visits to this country , under impressions of religious duty . He was the father of the Right Hon . William Edward Forster . He visited my father 's house in Haverhill during his first tour in the<country>United States</country>. The years are many since his hand Was laid upon my head , Too weak and young to understand The serious words he said . Yet often now the good man 's look Before me seems to swim , As if some inward feeling took The outward guise of him . As if , in passion 's heated war , Or near temptation 's charm , Through him the low-voiced monitor Forewarned me of the harm . Stranger and pilgrim ! from that day Of meeting , first and last , Wherever Duty 's pathway lay , His reverent steps have passed . The poor to feed , the lost to seek , To proffer life to death , Hope to the erring ,— to the weak The strength of his own faith . To plead the captive 's right ; remove The sting of hate from Law ; And soften in the fire of love The hardened steel of War . He walked the dark world , in the mild , Still guidance of the Light ; In tearful tenderness a child , A strong man in the right . From what great perils , on his way , He found , in prayer , release ; Through what abysmal shadows lay His pathway unto peace , God knoweth : we could only see The tranquil strength he gained ; The bondage lost in liberty , The fear in love unfeigned . And I ,— my youthful fancies grown The habit of the man , Whose field of life by angels sown The wilding vines o'erran ,— Low bowed in silent gratitude , My manhood 's heart enjoys That reverence for the pure and good Which blessed the dreaming boy 's . Still shines the light of holy lives Like star-beams over doubt ; Each sainted memory , Christlike , drives Some dark possession out . O friend ! O brother I not in vain Thy life so calm and true , The silver dropping of the rain , The fall of summer dew ! How many burdened hearts have prayed Their lives like thine might be But more shall pray henceforth for aid To lay them down like thee . With weary hand , yet steadfast will , In old age as in youth , Thy Master found thee sowing still The good seed of His truth . As on thy task-field closed the day In golden-skied decline , His angel met thee on the way , And lent his arm to thine . Thy latest care for man ,— thy last Of earthly thought a prayer ,— Oh , who thy mantle , backward cast , Is worthy now to wear ?</docImprint>

    <docDate>If I have seemed more prompt to censure wrong Than praise the right ; if seldom to thine ear My voice hath mingled with the exultant cheer Borne upon all our Northern winds along ; If I have failed to join the fickle throng In wide-eyed wonder , that thou standest strong In victory , surprised in thee to find Brougham 's scathing power with Canning 's grace combined ; That he , for whom the ninefold Muses sang , From their twined arms a giant athlete sprang , Barbing the arrows of his native tongue With the spent shafts Latona 's archer flung , To smite the Python of our land and time , Fell as the monster born of Crissa 's slime , Like the blind bard who in Castalian springs Tempered the steel that clove the crest of kings , And on the shrine of England 's freedom laid The gifts of Cumve and of Delphi 's ’ shade ,— Small need hast thou of words of praise from me . Thou knowest my heart , dear friend , and well canst guess That , even though silent , I have not the less Rejoiced to see thy actual life agree With the large future which I shaped for thee , When , years ago , beside the summer sea , White in the moon , we saw the long waves fall Baffled and broken from the rocky wall , That , to the menace of the brawling flood , Opposed alone its massive quietude , Calm as a fate ; with not a leaf nor vine Nor birch-spray trembling in the still moonshine , Crowning it like God 's peace . I sometimes think That night-scene by the sea prophetical , ( For Nature speaks in symbols and in signs , And through her pictures human fate divines ) , That rock , wherefrom we saw the billows sink In murmuring rout , uprising clear and tall In the white light of heaven , the type of one Who , momently by Error 's host assailed , Stands strong as Truth , in greaves of granite mailed ; And , tranquil-fronted , listening over all The tumult , hears the angels say , Well done !<date>1854</date>.</docDate>

      <docDate>The great work laid upon his twoscore years Is done , and well done . If we drop our tears , Who loved him as few men were ever loved , We mourn no blighted hope nor broken plan With him whose life stands rounded and approved In the full growth and stature of a man . Mingle , O bells , along the Western slope , With your deep toll a sound of faith and hope ! Wave cheerily still , O banner , half-way down , From thousand-masted bay and steepled town ! Let the strong organ with its loftiest swell Lift the proud sorrow of the land , and tell That the brave sower saw his ripened grain . O East and West ! O morn and sunset twain No more forever !— has he lived in vain Who , priest of Freedom , made ye one , and told Your bridal service from his lips of gold ?<date>1864</date>.</docDate>

       <l n="4">Without my manual sign to it .</l>
       <l n="5">Its piquant writer needs from me</l>

      <docDate>In trance and dream of old , God 's prophet saw The casting down of thrones . Thou , watching lone The hot Sardinian coast-line , hazy-hilled , Where , fringing round Caprera 's rocky zone With foam , the slow waves gather and withdraw , Behold'st the vision of the seer fulfilled , And hear'st the sea-winds burdened with a sound Of falling chains , as , one by one , unbound , The nations lift their right hands up and swear Their oath of freedom . From the chalk-white wall Of England , from the black Carpathian range , Along the Danube and the Theiss , through all The passes of the Spanish Pyrenees , And from the Seine 's thronged banks , a murmur strange And glad floats to thee o'er thy summer seas On the salt wind that stirs thy whitening hair ,— The song of freedom 's bloodless victories ! Rejoice , O Garibaldi ! Though thy sword Failed at Rome 's gates , and blood seemed vainly poured Where , in Christ 's name , the crowned infidel Of France wrought murder with the arms of hell On that sad mountain slope whose ghostly dead , Unmindful of the gray exorcist 's ban , Walk , unappeased , the chambered Vatican , And draw the curtains of Napoleon 's bed ! God 's providence is not blind , but , full of eyes , It searches all the refuges of lies ; And in His time and way , the accursed things Before whose evil feet thy battle-gage Has clashed defiance from hot youth to age Shall perish . All men shall be priests and kings , One royal brotherhood , one church made free By love , which is the law of liberty<date>1869</date>.</docDate>

     <p>THEIRS</p>
     <p>I . Fate summoned , in gray-bearded age , to act A history stranger than his written fact , Him who portrayed the splendor and the gloom Of that great hour when throne and altar fell With long death-groan which still is audible . He , when around the walls of Paris rung The Prussian bugle like the blast of doom , And every ill which follows unblest war Maddened all France from Finistere to Var , The weight of fourscore from his shoulders flung , And guided Freedom in the path he saw Lead out of chaos into light and law , Peace , not imperial , but republican , And order pledged to all the Rights of Man .</p>
     <p>II . Death called him from a need as imminent As that from which the Silent William went When powers of evil , like the smiting seas On Holland 's dikes , assailed her liberties . Sadly , while yet in doubtful balance hung The weal and woe of France , the bells were rung For her lost leader . Paralyzed of will , Above his bier the hearts of men stood still . Then , as if set to his dead lips , the horn Of Roland wound once more to rouse and warn , The old voice filled the air ! His last brave word Not vainly France to all her boundaries stirred . Strong as in life , he still for Freedom wrought , As the dead Cid at red Toloso fought . 1877 .</p>

     <p>BAYARD TAYLOR .</p>
     <p>I . “ And where now , Bayard , will thy footsteps tend ? ” My sister asked our guest one winter 's day . Smiling he answered in the Friends ’ sweet way Common to both : “ Wherever thou shall send ! What wouldst thou have me see for thee ? ” She laughed , Her dark eyes dancing in the wood-fire 's glow “ Loffoden isles , the Kilpis , and the low , Unsetting sun on Finmark 's fishing-craft . ” “ All these and more I soon shall see for thee ! ” He answered cheerily : and he kept his pledge On Lapland snows , the North Cape 's windy wedge , And Tromso freezing in its winter sea . He went and came . But no man knows the track Of his last journey , and he comes not back !</p>
     <p>II . He brought us wonders of the new and old ; We shared all climes with him . The Arab 's tent To him its story-telling secret lent . And , pleased , we listened to the tales he told . His task , beguiled with songs that shall endure , In manly , honest thoroughness he wrought ; From humble home-lays to the heights of thought Slowly he climbed , but every step was sure . How , with the generous pride that friendship hath , We , who so loved him , saw at last the crown Of civic honor on his brows pressed down , Rejoiced , and knew not that the gift was death . And now for him , whose praise in deafened ears Two nations speak , we answer but with tears !</p>
     <p>III . O Vale of Chester ! trod by him so oft , Green as thy June turf keep his memory . Let Nor wood , nor dell , nor storied stream forget , Nor winds that blow round lonely Cedarcroft ; Let the home voices greet him in the far , Strange land that holds him ; let the messages Of love pursue him o'er the chartless seas And unmapped vastness of his unknown star Love 's language , heard beyond the loud discourse Of perishable fame , in every sphere Itself interprets ; and its utterance here Somewhere in God 's unfolding universe Shall reach our traveller , softening the surprise Of his rapt gaze on unfamiliar skies ! 1879 .</p>
