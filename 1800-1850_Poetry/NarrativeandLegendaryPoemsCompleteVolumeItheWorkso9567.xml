    <p>THE WORKS OF JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER By John Greenleaf Whittier VOLUME I . NARRATIVE AND LEGENDARY POEMS</p>
   </div>
   <titlePage>
    <docImprint>PUBLISHERS ’ ADVERTISEMENT The Standard Library Edition of Mr. Whittier 's writings comprises his poetical and prose works as re-arranged and thoroughly revised by himself or with his cooperation . Mr. Whittier has supplied such additional information regarding the subject and occasion of certain poems as may be stated in brief head-notes , and this edition has been much enriched by the poet 's personal comment . So far as practicable the dates of publication of the various articles have been given , and since these were originally published soon after composition , the dates of their first appearance have been taken as determining the time at which they were written . At the request of the Publishers , Mr. Whittier has allowed his early poems , discarded from previous collections , to be placed , in the general order of their appearance , in an appendix to the final volume of poems . By this means the present edition is made so complete and retrospective that students of the poet 's career will always find the most abundant material for their purpose . The Publishers congratulate themselves and the public that the careful attention which Mr. Whittier has been able to give to this revision of his works has resulted in so comprehensive and well-adjusted a collection . The portraits prefixed to the several volumes have been chosen with a view to illustrating successive periods in the poet 's life . The original sources and dates are indicated in each case .</docImprint>

PROEM I LOVE the old melodious lays Which softly melt the ages through , The songs of Spenser 's golden days , Arcadian Sidney 's silvery phrase , Sprinkling our noon of time with freshest morning dew . Yet , vainly in my quiet hours To breathe their marvellous notes I try ; I feel them , as the leaves and flowers In silence feel the dewy showers , And drink with glad , still lips the blessing of the sky . The rigor of a frozen clime , The harshness of an untaught ear , The jarring words of one whose rhyme Beat often Labor 's hurried time , Or Duty 's rugged march through storm and strife , are here . Of mystic beauty , dreamy grace , No rounded art the lack supplies ; Unskilled the subtle lines to trace , Or softer shades of Nature 's face , I view her common forms with unanointed eyes . Nor mine the seer-like power to show The secrets of the heart and mind ; To drop the plummet-line below Our common world of joy and woe , A more intense despair or brighter hope to find . Yet here at least an earnest sense Of human right and weal is shown ; A hate of tyranny intense , And hearty in its vehemence , As if my brother 's pain and sorrow were my own . O Freedom ! if to me belong Nor mighty Milton 's gift divine , Nor Marvell 's wit and graceful song , Still with a love as deep and strong As theirs , I lay , like them , my best gifts on thy shrine .

    <head>INTRODUCTION</head>
    <p n="1">The edition of my poems published in 1857 contained the following note by way of preface :—</p>
    <p n="2">“ In these volumes , for the first time , a complete collection of my poetical writings has been made . While it is satisfactory to know that these scattered children of my brain have found a home , I cannot but regret that I have been unable , by reason of illness , to give that attention to their revision and arrangement , which respect for the opinions of others and my own afterthought and experience demand .</p>
    <p n="3">“ That there are pieces in this collection which I would ‘ willingly let die , ’ I am free to confess . But it is now too late to disown them , and I must submit to the inevitable penalty of poetical as well as other sins . There are others , intimately connected with the author 's life and times , which owe their tenacity of vitality to the circumstances under which they were written , and the events by which they were suggested .</p>
    <p n="4">“ The long poem of Mogg Megone was in a great measure composed in early life ; and it is scarcely necessary to say that its subject is not such as the writer would have chosen at any subsequent period . ”</p>
   </div>
   <titlePage>
    <docImprint>After a lapse of thirty years since the above was written , I have been requested by my publishers to make some preparation for a new and revised edition of my poems . I cannot flatter myself that I have added much to the interest of the work beyond the correction of my own errors and those of the press , with the addition of a few heretofore unpublished pieces , and occasional notes of explanation which seemed necessary . I have made an attempt to classify the poems under a few general heads , and have transferred the long poem of Mogg Megone to the Appendix , with other specimens of my earlier writings . I have endeavored to affix the dates of composition or publication as far as possible . In looking over these poems I have not been unmindful of occasional prosaic lines and verbal infelicities , but at this late day I have neither strength nor patience to undertake their correction . Perhaps a word of explanation may be needed in regard to a class of poems written between the years<date>1832</date>and<date>1865</date>. Of their defects from an artistic point of view it is not necessary to speak . They were the earnest and often vehement expression of the writer 's thought and feeling at critical periods in the great conflict between Freedom and Slavery . They were written with no expectation that they would survive the occasions which called them forth : they were protests , alarm signals , trumpet-calls to action , words wrung from the writer 's heart , forged at white heat , and of course lacking the finish and careful word-selection which reflection and patient brooding over them might have given . Such as they are , they belong to the history of the Anti-Slavery movement , and may serve as way-marks of its progress . If their language at times seems severe and harsh , the monstrous wrong of Slavery which provoked it must be its excuse , if any is needed . In attacking it , we did not measure our words . “ It is , ” said Garrison , “ a waste of politeness to be courteous to the devil . ” But in truth the contest was , in a great measure , an impersonal one ,— hatred of slavery and not of slave-masters .</docImprint>
    <epigraph>
     <p>“ No common wrong provoked our zeal , The silken gauntlet which is thrown In such a quarrel rings like steel . ” Even Thomas Jefferson , in his terrible denunciation of Slavery in the Notes on Virginia , says “ It is impossible to be temperate and pursue the subject of Slavery . ” After the great contest was over , no class of the American people were more ready , with kind words and deprecation of harsh retaliation , to welcome back the revolted States than the Abolitionists ; and none have since more heartily rejoiced at the fast increasing prosperity of the South . Grateful for the measure of favor which has been accorded to my writings , I leave this edition with the public . It contains all that I care to re-publish , and some things which , had the matter of choice been left solely to myself , I should have omitted . J. G. W .</p>

   <head>THE VAUDOIS TEACHER .</head>
   <p>This poem was suggested by the account given of the manner which the Waldenses disseminated their principles among the Catholic gentry . They gained access to the house through their occupation as peddlers of silks , jewels , and trinkets . “ Having disposed of some of their goods , ” it is said by a writer who quotes the inquisitor Rainerus Sacco , “ they cautiously intimated that they had commodities far more valuable than these , inestimable jewels , which they would show if they could be protected from the clergy . They would then give their purchasers a Bible or Testament ; and thereby many were deluded into heresy . ” The poem , under the title Le Colporteur Vaudois , was translated into French by Professor G. de Felice , of Montauban , and further naturalized by Professor Alexandre Rodolphe Vinet , who quoted it in his lectures on French literature , afterwards published . It became familiar in this form to the Waldenses , who adopted it as a household poem . An American clergyman , J. C. Fletcher , frequently heard it when he was a student , about the year 1850 , in the theological seminary at Geneva , Switzerland , but the authorship of the poem was unknown to those who used it . Twenty-five years later , Mr. Fletcher , learning the name of the author , wrote to the moderator of the Waldensian synod at La Tour , giving the information . At the banquet which closed the meeting of the synod , the moderator announced the fact , and was instructed in the name of the Waldensian church to write to me a letter of thanks . My letter , written in reply , was translated into Italian and printed throughout Italy .</p>
   <p>“ O LADY fair , these silks of mine are beautiful and rare ,— The richest web of the Indian loom , which beauty 's queen might wear ; And my pearls are pure as thy own fair neck , with whose radiant light they vie ; I have brought them with me a weary way ,— will my gentle lady buy ? ”</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">The lady smiled on the worn old man through the</l>
     <l n="2">dark and clustering curls</l>
     <l n="3">Which veiled her brow , as she bent to view his</l>
     <l n="4">silks and glittering pearls ;</l>
     <l n="5">And she placed their price in the old man 's hand</l>
     <l n="6">and lightly turned away ,</l>
     <l n="7">But she paused at the wanderer 's earnest call ,—</l>
     <l n="8">“ My gentle lady , stay !</l>
   </lg>
   <p>“ O lady fair , I have yet a gem which a purer lustre flings , Than the diamond flash of the jewelled crown on the lofty brow of kings ; A wonderful pearl of exceeding price , whose virtue shall not decay , Whose light shall be as a spell to thee and a blessing on thy way ! ”</p>
   <p>The lady glanced at the mirroring steel where her form of grace was seen , Where her eye shone clear , and her dark locks waved their clasping pearls between ; “ Bring forth thy pearl of exceeding worth , thou traveller gray and old , And name the price of thy precious gem , and my page shall count thy gold . ”</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">The cloud went off from the pilgrim 's brow , as a</l>
     <l n="2">small and meagre book ,</l>
     <l n="3">Unchased with gold or gem of cost , from his</l>
     <l n="4">folding robe he took !</l>
     <l n="5">“ Here , lady fair , is the pearl of price , may it prove</l>
     <l n="6">as such to thee</l>
     <l n="7">Nay , keep thy gold — I ask it not , for the word of</l>
     <l n="8">God is free ! ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The hoary traveller went his way , but the gift he left behind Hath had its pure and perfect work on that high - born maiden 's mind , And she hath turned from the pride of sin to the lowliness of truth , And given her human heart to God in its beautiful hour of youth</p>
   <p>And she hath left the gray old halls , where an evil faith had power , The courtly knights of her father 's train , and the maidens of her bower ; And she hath gone to the Vaudois vales by lordly feet untrod , Where the poor and needy of earth are rich in the perfect love of God ! 1830 .</p>

    <head>THE FEMALE MARTYR .</head>
    <head>Mary G —— -  , aged eighteen , a “ Sister of Charity , ” died in one of our Atlantic cities , during the prevalence of the Indian cholera , while in voluntary attendance upon the sick .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ BRING out your dead ! ” The midnight street</l>
     <l n="2">Heard and gave back the hoarse , low call ;</l>
     <l n="3">Harsh fell the tread of hasty feet ,</l>
     <l n="4">Glanced through the dark the coarse white sheet ,</l>
     <l n="5">Her coffin and her pall .</l>
     <l n="6">“ What — only one ! ” the brutal hack-man said ,</l>
     <l n="7">As , with an oath , he spurned away the dead .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="8">How sunk the inmost hearts of all ,</l>
     <l n="9">As rolled that dead-cart slowly by ,</l>
     <l n="10">With creaking wheel and harsh hoof-fall !</l>
     <l n="11">The dying turned him to the wall ,</l>
     <l n="12">To hear it and to die !</l>
     <l n="13">Onward it rolled ; while oft its driver stayed ,</l>
     <l n="14">And hoarsely clamored , “ Ho ! bring out your dead . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="15">It paused beside the burial-place ;</l>
     <l n="16">“ Toss in your load ! ” and it was done .</l>
     <l n="17">With quick hand and averted face ,</l>
     <l n="18">Hastily to the grave 's embrace</l>
     <l n="19">They cast them , one by one ,</l>
     <l n="20">Stranger and friend , the evil and the just ,</l>
     <l n="21">Together trodden in the churchyard dust .</l>
    </lg>

     <l n="25">Rose through the damp and noisome air ,</l>
     <l n="26">Giving thee to thy God ;</l>
     <l n="27">Nor flower , nor cross , nor hallowed taper gave</l>

     <l n="32">As if beneath the convent-tree</l>
     <l n="33">Thy sisterhood were kneeling ,</l>
     <l n="34">At vesper hours , like sorrowing angels , keeping</l>

     <l n="36">For thou wast one in whom the light</l>

     <l n="39">Through weary day and wakeful night ,</l>
     <l n="40">Far more than words may tell</l>
     <l n="41">Gentle , and meek , and lowly , and unknown ,</l>

     <l n="43">Where manly hearts were failing , where</l>

     <l n="48">Where the raised lid unveils its glances ;</l>

     <l n="63">His charmed torch beside his knee ,</l>
     <l n="64">That even the dead himself might see</l>

    <head>PENTUCKET .</head>
    <head>The village of Haverhill , on the Merrimac , called by the Indians Pentucket , was for nearly seventeen years a frontier town , and during thirty years endured all the horrors of savage warfare . In the year 1708 , a combined body of French and Indians , under the command of De Chaillons , and Hertel de Rouville , the famous and bloody sacker of Deerfield , made an attack upon the village , which at that time contained only thirty houses . Sixteen of the villagers were massacred , and a still larger number made prisoners . About thirty of the enemy also fell , among them Hertel de Rouville . The minister of the place , Benjamin Rolfe , was killed by a shot through his own door . In a paper entitled The Border War of 1708 , published in my collection of Recreations and Miscellanies , I have given a prose narrative of the surprise of Haverhill .</head>

    <head>THE NORSEMEN .</head>
    <head>In the early part of the present century , a fragment of a statue , rudely chiselled from dark gray stone , was found in the town of Bradford , on the Merrimac . Its origin must be left entirely to conjecture . The fact that the ancient Northmen visited the north-east coast of North America and probably New England , some centuries before the discovery of the western world by Columbus , is very generally admitted .</head>

    <head>FUNERAL TREE OF THE SOKOKIS .</head>
    <head>Polan , chief of the Sokokis Indians of the country between Agamenticus and Casco Bay , was killed at Windham on Sebago Lake in the spring of 1756 . After the whites had retired , the surviving Indians “ swayed ” or bent down a young tree until its roots were upturned , placed the body of their chief beneath it , then released the tree , which , in springing back to its old position , covered the grave . The Sokokis were early converts to the Catholic faith . Most of them , prior to the year 1756 , had removed to the French settlements on the St. Francois .</head>

    <head>ST. JOHN .</head>
    <head>The fierce rivalry between Charles de La Tour , a Protestant , and D'Aulnay Charnasy , a Catholic , for the possession of Acadia , forms one of the most romantic passages in the history of the New World . La Tour received aid in several instances from the Puritan colony of Massachusetts . During one of his voyages for the purpose of obtaining arms and provisions for his establishment at St. John , his castle was attacked by D'Aulnay , and successfully defended by its high-spirited mistress . A second attack however followed in the fourth month , 1647 , when D'Aulnay was successful , and the garrison was put to the sword . Lady La Tour languished a few days in the hands of her enemy , and then died of grief .</head>

    <head>CASSANDRA SOUTHWICK .</head>
    <head>In 1658 two young persons , son and daughter of Lawrence Smithwick of Salem , who had himself been imprisoned and deprived of nearly all his property for having entertained Quakers at his house , were fined for non-attendance at church . They being unable to pay the fine , the General Court issued an order empowering “ the Treasurer of the County to sell the said persons to any of the English nation of Virginia or Barbadoes , to answer said fines . ” An attempt was made to carry this order into execution , but no shipmaster was found willing to convey them to the West Indies .</head>
     <l n="1">To the God of all sure mercies let my blessing rise</l>
     <l n="2">to-day ,</l>
     <l n="3">From the scoffer and the cruel He hath plucked</l>
     <l n="4">the spoil away ;</l>
     <l n="5">Yea , He who cooled the furnace around the faithful</l>
     <l n="6">three ,</l>
     <l n="7">And tamed the Chaldean lions , hath set His hand-</l>
     <l n="8">maid free !</l>
     <l n="9">Last night I saw the sunset melt through my prison</l>
     <l n="10">bars ,</l>
     <l n="11">Last night across my damp earth-floor fell the pale</l>
     <l n="12">gleam of stars ;</l>
     <l n="13">In the coldness and the darkness all through the</l>
     <l n="14">long night-time ,</l>
     <l n="15">My grated casement whitened with autumn 's early</l>
     <l n="16">rime .</l>
     <l n="17">Alone , in that dark sorrow , hour after hour crept</l>
     <l n="18">by ;</l>
     <l n="19">Star after star looked palely in and sank adown</l>
     <l n="20">the sky ;</l>
     <l n="21">No sound amid night 's stillness , save that which</l>
     <l n="22">seemed to be</l>
     <l n="23">The dull and heavy beating of the pulses of the sea ;</l>
   </lg>
   <p>All night I sat unsleeping , for I knew that on the morrow The ruler and the cruel priest would mock me in my sorrow , Dragged to their place of market , and bargained for and sold , Like a lamb before the shambles , like a heifer from the fold !</p>
   <p>Oh , the weakness of the flesh was there , the shrinking and the shame ; And the low voice of the Tempter like whispers to me came : “ Why sit'st thou thus forlornly , ” the wicked murmur said , “ Damp walls thy bower of beauty , cold earth thy maiden bed ?</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ Where be the smiling faces , and voices soft and</l>
     <l n="2">sweet ,</l>
     <l n="3">Seen in thy father 's dwelling , heard in the pleasant</l>
     <l n="4">street ?</l>
     <l n="5">Where be the youths whose glances , the summer</l>
     <l n="6">Sabbath through ,</l>
     <l n="7">Turned tenderly and timidly unto thy father 's pew ?</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="8">“ Why sit'st thou here , Cassandra ? -Bethink</l>
     <l n="9">thee with what mirth</l>
     <l n="10">Thy happy schoolmates gather around the warm</l>
     <l n="11">bright hearth ;</l>
     <l n="12">How the crimson shadows tremble on foreheads</l>
     <l n="13">white and fair ,</l>
     <l n="14">On eyes of merry girlhood , half hid in golden hair .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>“ Not for thee the hearth-fire brightens , not for thee kind words are spoken , Not for thee the nuts of Wenham woods by laughing boys are broken ; No first-fruits of the orchard within thy lap are laid , For thee no flowers of autumn the youthful hunters braid .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ O weak , deluded maiden !— by crazy fancies</l>
     <l n="2">led ,</l>
     <l n="3">With wild and raving railers an evil path to tread ;</l>
     <l n="4">To leave a wholesome worship , and teaching pure</l>
     <l n="5">and sound ,</l>
     <l n="6">And mate with maniac women , loose-haired and</l>
     <l n="7">sackcloth bound ,—</l>
   </lg>
   <p>“ Mad scoffers of the priesthood ; who mock at things divine , Who rail against the pulpit , and holy bread and wine ; Sore from their cart-tail scourgings , and from the pillory lame , Rejoicing in their wretchedness , and glorying in their shame .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ And what a fate awaits thee !— a sadly toiling</l>
     <l n="2">slave ,</l>
     <l n="3">Dragging the slowly lengthening chain of bondage</l>
     <l n="4">to the grave !</l>
     <l n="5">Think of thy woman 's nature , subdued in hopeless</l>
     <l n="6">thrall ,</l>
     <l n="7">The easy prey of any , the scoff and scorn of all ! ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Oh , ever as the Tempter spoke , and feeble Nature 's fears Wrung drop by drop the scalding flow of unavailing tears , I wrestled down the evil thoughts , and strove in silent prayer , To feel , O Helper of the weak ! that Thou indeed wert there !</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">I thought of Paul and Silas , within Philippi 's cell ,</l>
     <l n="2">And how from Peter 's sleeping limbs the prison</l>
     <l n="3">shackles fell ,</l>
     <l n="4">Till I seemed to hear the trailing of an angel 's</l>
     <l n="5">robe of white ,</l>
     <l n="6">And to feel a blessed presence invisible to sight .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Bless the Lord for all his mercies !— for the peace and love I felt , Like dew of Hermon 's holy hill , upon my spirit melt ; When “ Get behind me , Satan ! ” was the language of my heart , And I felt the Evil Tempter with all his doubts depart .</p>
   <p>Slow broke the gray cold morning ; again the sunshine fell , Flecked with the shade of bar and grate within my lonely cell ; The hoar-frost melted on the wall , and upward from the street Came careless laugh and idle word , and tread of passing feet .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">At length the heavy bolts fell back , my door was</l>
     <l n="2">open cast ,</l>
     <l n="3">And slowly at the sheriff 's side , up the long street</l>
     <l n="4">I passed ;</l>
     <l n="5">I heard the murmur round me , and felt , but dared</l>
     <l n="6">not see ,</l>
     <l n="7">How , from every door and window , the people</l>
     <l n="8">gazed on me .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>And doubt and fear fell on me , shame burned upon my cheek , Swam earth and sky around me , my trembling limbs grew weak : “ O Lord ! support thy handmaid ; and from her soul cast out The fear of man , which brings a snare , the weakness and the doubt . ”</p>
   <p>Then the dreary shadows scattered , like a cloud in morning 's breeze , And a low deep voice within me seemed whispering words like these : “ Though thy earth be as the iron , and thy heaven a brazen wall , Trust still His loving-kindness whose power is over all . ”</p>
   <p>We paused at length , where at my feet the sunlit waters broke On glaring reach of shining beach , and shingly wall of rock ; The merchant-ships lay idly there , in hard clear lines on high , Tracing with rope and slender spar their network on the sky .</p>
   <p>And there were ancient citizens , cloak-wrapped and grave and cold , And grim and stout sea-captains with faces bronzed and old , And on his horse , with Rawson , his cruel clerk at hand , Sat dark and haughty Endicott , the ruler of the land .</p>
   <p>And poisoning with his evil words the ruler 's ready ear , The priest leaned o'er his saddle , with laugh and scoff and jeer ; It stirred my soul , and from my lips the seal of silence broke , As if through woman 's weakness a warning spirit spoke .</p>
   <p>I cried , “ The Lord rebuke thee , thou smiter of the meek , Thou robber of the righteous , thou trampler of the weak ! Go light the dark , cold hearth-stones ,— go turn the prison lock Of the poor hearts thou hast hunted , thou wolf amid the flock ! ”</p>
   <p>Dark lowered the brows of Endicott , and with a deeper red O'er Rawson 's wine-empurpled cheek the flush of anger spread ; “ Good people , ” quoth the white-lipped priest , “ heed not her words so wild , Her Master speaks within her ,— the Devil owns his child ! ”</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">But gray heads shook , and young brows knit , the</l>
     <l n="2">while the sheriff read</l>
     <l n="3">That law the wicked rulers against the poor have</l>
     <l n="4">made ,</l>
     <l n="5">Who to their house of Rimmon and idol priesthood</l>
     <l n="6">bring</l>
     <l n="7">No bended knee of worship , nor gainful offering .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="8">Then to the stout sea-captains the sheriff , turning ,</l>
     <l n="9">said ,—</l>
     <l n="10">“ Which of ye , worthy seamen , will take this</l>
     <l n="11">Quaker maid ?</l>
     <l n="12">In the Isle of fair Barbadoes , or on Virginia 's</l>
     <l n="13">shore ,</l>
     <l n="14">You may hold her at a higher price than Indian</l>
     <l n="15">girl or Moor . ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Grim and silent stood the captains ; and when again he cried , “ Speak out , my worthy seamen ! ” — no voice , no sign replied ; But I felt a hard hand press my own , and kind words met my ear ,— “ God bless thee , and preserve thee , my gentle girl and dear ! ”</p>
   <p>A weight seemed lifted from my heart , a pitying friend was nigh ,— I felt it in his hard , rough hand , and saw it in his eye ; And when again the sheriff spoke , that voice , so kind to me , Growled back its stormy answer like the roaring of the sea ,—</p>
   <p>“ Pile my ship with bars of silver , pack with coins of Spanish gold , From keel-piece up to deck-plank , the roomage of her hold , By the living God who made me !— I would sooner in your bay Sink ship and crew and cargo , than bear this child away ! ”</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Well answered , worthy captain , shame on their</l>
     <l n="2">cruel laws ! ”</l>
     <l n="3">Ran through the crowd in murmurs loud the people 's</l>
     <l n="4">just applause .</l>
     <l n="5">“ Like the herdsman of Tekoa , in Israel of old ,</l>
     <l n="6">Shall we see the poor and righteous again for</l>
     <l n="7">silver sold ? ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>I looked on haughty Endicott ; with weapon half - way drawn , Swept round the throng his lion glare of bitter hate and scorn ; Fiercely he drew his bridle-rein , and turned in silence back , And sneering priest and baffled clerk rode murmuring in his track .</p>
   <p>Hard after them the sheriff looked , in bitterness of soul ; Thrice smote his staff upon the ground , and crushed his parchment roll . “ Good friends , ” he said , “ since both have fled , the ruler and the priest , Judge ye , if from their further work I be not well released . ”</p>
   <p>Loud was the cheer which , full and clear , swept round the silent bay , As , with kind words and kinder looks , he bade me go my way ; For He who turns the courses of the streamlet of the glen , And the river of great waters , had turned the hearts of men .</p>
   <p>Oh , at that hour the very earth seemed changed beneath my eye , A holier wonder round me rose the blue walls of the sky , A lovelier light on rock and hill and stream and woodland lay , And softer lapsed on sunnier sands the waters of the bay .</p>
   <p>Thanksgiving to the Lord of life ! to Him all praises be , Who from the hands of evil men hath set his hand - maid free ; All praise to Him before whose power the mighty are afraid , Who takes the crafty in the snare which for the poor is laid !</p>
   <p>Sing , O my soul , rejoicingly , on evening 's twilight calm Uplift the loud thanksgiving , pour forth the grateful psalm ; Let all dear hearts with me rejoice , as did the saints of old , When of the Lord 's good angel the rescued Peter told .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">And weep and howl , ye evil priests and mighty</l>
     <l n="2">men of wrong ,</l>
     <l n="3">The Lord shall smite the proud , and lay His hand</l>
     <l n="4">upon the strong .</l>
     <l n="5">Woe to the wicked rulers in His avenging hour !</l>
     <l n="6">Woe to the wolves who seek the flocks to raven</l>
     <l n="7">and devour !</l>
   </lg>
   <p>But let the humble ones arise , the poor in heart be glad , And let the mourning ones again with robes of praise be clad . For He who cooled the furnace , and smoothed the stormy wave , And tamed the Chaldean lions , is mighty still to save !</p>

    <head>THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK .</head>
    <head>Winnepurkit , otherwise called George , Sachem of Saugus , married a daughter of Passaconaway , the great Pennacook chieftain , in 1662 . The wedding took place at Pennacook ( now Concord , N. H .) , and the ceremonies closed with a great feast . According to the usages of the chiefs , Passaconaway ordered a select number of his men to accompany the newly-married couple to the dwelling of the husband , where in turn there was another great feast . Some time after , the wife of Winnepurkit expressing a desire to visit her father 's house was permitted to go , accompanied by a brave escort of her husband 's chief men . But when she wished to return , her father sent a messenger to Saugus , informing her husband , and asking him to come and take her away . He returned for answer that he had escorted his wife to her father 's house in a style that became a chief , and that now if she wished to return , her father must send her back , in the same way . This Passaconaway refused to do , and it is said that here terminated the connection of his daughter with the Saugus chief .— Vide MORTON 'S New Canaan .</head>

    <head>BARCLAY OF URY .</head>
    <head>Among the earliest converts to the doctrines of Friends in Scotland was Barclay of Ury , an old and distinguished soldier , who had fought under Gustavus Adolphus , in Germany . As a Quaker , he became the object of persecution and abuse at the hands of the magistrates and the populace . None bore the indignities of the mob with greater patience and nobleness of soul than this once proud gentleman and soldier . One of his friends , on an occasion of uncommon rudeness , lamented that he should be treated so harshly in his old age who had been so honored before . “ I find more satisfaction , ” said Barclay , “ as well as honor , in being thus insulted for my religious principles , than when , a few years ago , it was usual for the magistrates , as I passed the city of Aberdeen , to meet me on the road and conduct me to public entertainment in their hall , and then escort me out again , to gain my favor . ”</head>

   <p>THE ANGELS OF BUENA VISTA .</p>
   <p>A letter-writer from Mexico during the Mexican war , when detailing some of the incidents at the terrible fight of Buena Vista , mentioned that Mexican women were seen hovering near the field of death , for the purpose of giving aid and succor to the wounded . One poor woman was found surrounded by the maimed and suffering of both armies , ministering to the wants of Americans as well as Mexicans , with impartial tenderness .</p>
   <p>SPEAK and tell us , our Ximena , looking northward far away , O'er the camp of the invaders , o'er the Mexican array , Who is losing ? who is winning ? are they far or come they near ? Look abroad , and tell us , sister , whither rolls the storm we hear . Down the hills of Angostura still the storm of battle rolls ; Blood is flowing , men are dying ; God have mercy on their souls ! “ Who is losing ? who is winning ? ” Over hill and over plain , I see but smoke of cannon clouding through the mountain rain .</p>
   <p>Holy Mother ! keep our brothers ! Look , Ximena , look once more . “ Still I see the fearful whirlwind rolling darkly as before , Bearing on , in strange confusion , friend and foeman , foot and horse , Like some wild and troubled torrent sweeping down its mountain course . ”</p>
   <p>Look forth once more , Ximena ! “ Ah ! the smoke has rolled away ; And I see the Northern rifles gleaming down the ranks of gray . Hark ! that sudden blast of bugles ! there the troop of Minon wheels ; There the Northern horses thunder , with the cannon at their heels .</p>
   <p>“ Jesu , pity I how it thickens I now retreat and now advance ! Bight against the blazing cannon shivers Puebla 's charging lance ! Down they go , the brave young riders ; horse and foot together fall ; Like a ploughshare in the fallow , through them ploughs the Northern ball . ”</p>
   <p>Nearer came the storm and nearer , rolling fast and frightful on ! Speak , Ximena , speak and tell us , who has lost , and who has won ? Alas ! alas ! I know not ; friend and foe together fall , O'er the dying rush the living : pray , my sisters , for them all !</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Lo ! the wind the smoke is lifting . Blessed</l>
     <l n="2">Mother , save my brain !</l>
     <l n="3">I can see the wounded crawling slowly out from</l>
     <l n="4">heaps of slain .</l>
     <l n="5">Now they stagger , blind and bleeding ; now they</l>
     <l n="6">fall , and strive to rise ;</l>
     <l n="7">Hasten , sisters , haste and save them , lest they die</l>
     <l n="8">before our eyes !</l>
   </lg>
   <p>“ O my hearts love ! O my dear one ! lay thy poor head on my knee ; Dost thou know the lips that kiss thee ? Canst thou hear me ? canst thou see ? O my husband , brave and gentle ! O my Bernal , look once more On the blessed cross before thee ! Mercy ! all is o'er ! ”</p>
   <p>Dry thy tears , my poor Ximena ; lay thy dear one down to rest ; Let his hands be meekly folded , lay the cross upon his breast ; Let his dirge be sung hereafter , and his funeral masses said ; To-day , thou poor bereaved one , the living ask thy aid .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Close beside her , faintly moaning , fair and young ,</l>
     <l n="2">a soldier lay ,</l>
     <l n="3">Torn with shot and pierced with lances , bleeding</l>
     <l n="4">slow his life away ;</l>
     <l n="5">But , as tenderly before him the lorn Ximena knelt ,</l>
     <l n="6">She saw the Northern eagle shining on his pistol-</l>
     <l n="7">belt .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>With a stifled cry of horror straight she turned away her head ; With a sad and bitter feeling looked she back upon her dead ; But she heard the youth 's low moaning , and his struggling breath of pain , And she raised the cooling water to his parching lips again .</p>
   <p>Whispered low the dying soldier , pressed her hand and faintly smiled ; Was that pitying face his mother 's ? did she watch beside her child ? All his stranger words with meaning her woman 's heart supplied ; With her kiss upon his forehead , “ Mother ! ” murmured he , and died !</p>
   <p>“ A bitter curse upon them , poor boy , who led thee forth , From some gentle , sad-eyed mother , weeping , lonely , in the North ! ” Spake the mournful Mexic woman , as she laid him with her dead , And turned to soothe the living , and bind the wounds which bled .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Look forth once more , Ximena ! ” Like a cloud</l>
     <l n="2">before the wind</l>
     <l n="3">Rolls the battle down the mountains , leaving blood</l>
     <l n="4">and death behind ;</l>
     <l n="5">Ah ! they plead in vain for mercy ; in the dust the</l>
     <l n="6">wounded strive ;</l>
     <l n="7">“ Hide your faces , holy angels ! O thou Christ of</l>
     <l n="8">God , forgive ! ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Sink , O Night , among thy mountains ! let the cool , gray shadows fall ; Dying brothers , fighting demons , drop thy curtain over all ! Through the thickening winter twilight , wide apart the battle rolled , In its sheath the sabre rested , and the cannon 's lips grew cold .</p>
   <p>But the noble Mexic women still their holy task pursued , Through that long , dark night of sorrow , worn and faint and lacking food . Over weak and suffering brothers , with a tender care they hung , And the dying foeman blessed them in a strange and Northern tongue .</p>
   <p>Not wholly lost , O Father ! is this evil world of ours ; Upward , through its blood and ashes , spring afresh the Eden flowers ; From its smoking hell of battle , Love and Pity send their prayer , And still thy white-winged angels hover dimly in our air !</p>

    <head>THE LEGEND OF ST. MARK .</head>
    <head>“ This legend ( to which my attention was called by my friend Charles Sumner ) , is the subject of a celebrated picture by Tintoretto , of which Mr. Rogers possesses the original sketch . The slave lies on the ground , amid a crowd of spectators , who look on , animated by all the various emotions of sympathy , rage , terror ; a woman , in front , with a child in her arms , has always been admired for the lifelike vivacity of her attitude and expression . The executioner holds up the broken implements ; St. Mark , with a headlong movement , seems to rush down from heaven in haste to save his worshipper . The dramatic grouping in this picture is wonderful ; the coloring , in its gorgeous depth and harmony , is , in Mr. Rogers 's sketch , finer than in the picture . ” — MRS.

    <head>This ballad was originally published in my prose work , Leaves from Margaret Smith 's Journal , as the song of a wandering Milesian schoolmaster . In the seventeenth century , slavery in the New World was by no means confined to the natives of Africa . Political offenders and criminals were transported by the British government to the plantations of Barbadoes and Virginia , where they were sold like cattle in the market .

   <p>THE CHAPEL OF THE HERMITS .</p>
   <p>The incident upon which this poem is based is related in a note to Bernardin Henri Saint Pierre 's Etudes de la Nature . “ We arrived at the habitation of the Hermits a little before they sat down to their table , and while they were still at church . J. J. Rousseau proposed to me to offer up our devotions . The hermits were reciting the Litanies of Providence , which are remarkably beautiful . After we had addressed our prayers to God , and the hermits were proceeding to the refectory , Rousseau said to me , with his heart overflowing , ‘ At this moment I experience what is said in the gospel : Where two or three are gathered together in my name , there am I in the midst of them . There is here a feeling of peace and happiness which penetrates the soul . ’ I said , ‘ If Finelon had lived , you would have been a Catholic . ’ He exclaimed , with tears in his eyes , ‘ Oh , if Finelon were alive , I would struggle to get into his service , even as a lackey ! ’ ” In my sketch of Saint Pierre , it will be seen that I have somewhat antedated the period of his old age . At that time he was not probably more than fifty . In describing him , I have by no means exaggerated his own history of his mental condition at the period of the story . In the fragmentary Sequel to his Studies of Nature , he thus speaks of himself : “ The ingratitude of those of whom I had deserved kindness , unexpected family misfortunes , the total loss of my small patrimony through enterprises solely undertaken for the benefit of my country , the debts under which I lay oppressed , the blasting of all my hopes ,— these combined calamities made dreadful inroads upon my health and reason . . . . I found it impossible to continue in a room where there was company , especially if the doors were shut . I could not even cross an alley in a public garden , if several persons had got together in it . When alone , my malady subsided . I felt myself likewise at ease in places where I saw children only . At the sight of any one walking up to the place where I was , I felt my whole frame agitated , and retired . I often said to myself , ‘ My sole study has been to merit well of mankind ; why do I fear them ? ’ ”</p>
   <p>He attributes his improved health of mind and body to the counsels of his friend , J. J. Rousseau . “ I renounced , ” says he , “ my books . I threw my eyes upon the works of nature , which spake to all my senses a language which neither time nor nations have it in their power to alter . Thenceforth my histories and my journals were the herbage of the fields and meadows . My thoughts did not go forth painfully after them , as in the case of human systems ; but their thoughts , under a thousand engaging forms , quietly sought me . In these I studied , without effort , the laws of that Universal Wisdom which had surrounded me from the cradle , but on which heretofore I had bestowed little attention . ”</p>
   <p>Speaking of Rousseau , he says : “ I derived inexpressible satisfaction from his society . What I prized still more than his genius was his probity . He was one of the few literary characters , tried in the furnace of affliction , to whom you could , with perfect security , confide your most secret thoughts . . . . Even when he deviated , and became the victim of himself or of others , he could forget his own misery in devotion to the welfare of mankind . He was uniformly the advocate of the miserable . There might be inscribed on his tomb these affecting words from that Book of which he carried always about him some select passages , during the last years of his life : ‘ His sins , which are many , are forgiven , for he loved much . ’ ”</p>

     <l n="54">Tears sprang in Tauler 's eyes . A sudden light ,</l>
     <l n="55">Like the first ray which fell on chaos , clove</l>
     <l n="56">Apart the shadow wherein he had walked</l>
     <l n="57">Darkly at noon . And , as the strange old man</l>
     <l n="58">Went his slow way , until his silver hair</l>
     <l n="59">Set like the white moon where the hills of vine</l>
     <l n="60">Slope to the Rhine , he bowed his head and said</l>

     <l n="64">So , entering with a changed and cheerful step</l>

     <l n="78">The dark triangle of its shade alone</l>

     <l n="80">So , darkness in the pathway of Man 's life</l>

    <head>MAUD MULLER .</head>
    <head>The recollection of some descendants of a Hessian deserter in the Revolutionary war bearing the name of Muller doubtless suggested the somewhat infelicitous title of a New England idyl . The poem had no real foundation in fact , though a hint of it may have been found in recalling an incident , trivial in itself , of a journey on the picturesque Maine seaboard with my sister some years before it was written . We had stopped to rest our tired horse under the shade of an apple-tree , and refresh him with water from a little brook which rippled through the stone wall across the road . A very beautiful young girl in scantest summer attire was at work in the hay-field , and as we talked with her we noticed that she strove to hide her bare feet by raking hay over them , blushing as she did so , through the tan of her cheek and neck .</head>

     <l n="9">The sweet song died , and a vague unrest</l>

    <head>MARY GARVIN .</head>
    <head>FROM the heart of Waumbek Methna , from the lake that never fails , Falls the Saco in the green lap of Conway 's intervales ; There , in wild and virgin freshness , its waters foam and flow , As when Darby Field first saw them , two hundred years ago .</head>
     <l n="1">But , vexed in all its seaward course with bridges ,</l>
     <l n="2">dams , and mills ,</l>
     <l n="3">How changed is Saco 's stream , how lost its freedom</l>
     <l n="4">of the hills ,</l>
     <l n="5">Since travelled Jocelyn , factor Vines , and stately</l>
     <l n="6">Champernoon</l>
     <l n="7">Heard on its banks the gray wolf 's howl , the trumpet</l>
     <l n="8">of the loon !</l>
   </lg>
   <p>With smoking axle hot with speed , with steeds of fire and steam , Wide-waked To-day leaves Yesterday behind him like a dream . Still , from the hurrying train of Life , fly backward far and fast The milestones of the fathers , the landmarks of the past .</p>
   <p>But human hearts remain unchanged : the sorrow and the sin , The loves and hopes and fears of old , are to our own akin ;</p>
   <p>And if , in tales our fathers told , the songs our mothers sung , Tradition wears a snowy beard , Romance is always young .</p>

     <l n="1">O sharp-lined man of traffic , on Saco 's banks today !</l>

     <l n="4">Let , for the once , a listening ear the working hand</l>
     <l n="5">beguile ,</l>

   <p>The evening gun had sounded from gray Fort Mary 's walls ; Through the forest , like a wild beast , roared and plunged the Saco 's ’ falls .</p>
   <p>And westward on the sea-wind , that damp and gusty grew , Over cedars darkening inland the smokes of Spurwink blew .</p>
   <p>On the hearth of Farmer Garvin , blazed the crackling walnut log ; Right and left sat dame and goodman , and between them lay the dog ,</p>
   <p>Head on paws , and tail slow wagging , and beside him on her mat , Sitting drowsy in the firelight , winked and purred the mottled cat .</p>
   <p>“ Twenty years ! ” said Goodman Garvin , speaking sadly , under breath , And his gray head slowly shaking , as one who speaks of death .</p>
   <p>The goodwife dropped her needles : “ It is twenty years to-day , Since the Indians fell on Saco , and stole our child away . ”</p>
   <p>Then they sank into the silence , for each knew the other 's thought , Of a great and common sorrow , and words were , needed not .</p>
   <p>“ Who knocks ? ” cried Goodman Garvin . The door was open thrown ; On two strangers , man and maiden , cloaked and furred , the fire-light shone .</p>
   <p>One with courteous gesture lifted the bear-skin from his head ; “ Lives here Elkanah Garvin ? ” “ I am he , ” the goodman said .</p>
   <p>“ Sit ye down , and dry and warm ye , for the night is chill with rain . ” And the goodwife drew the settle , and stirred the fire amain .</p>
   <p>The maid unclasped her cloak-hood , the firelight glistened fair In her large , moist eyes , and over soft folds of dark brown hair .</p>
   <p>Dame Garvin looked upon her : “ It is Mary 's self I see ! ” “ Dear heart ! ” she cried , “ now tell me , has my child come back to me ? ”</p>
   <p>“ My name indeed is Mary , ” said the stranger sobbing wild ; “ Will you be to me a mother ? I am Mary Garvin 's child ! ”</p>
   <p>“ She sleeps by wooded Simcoe , but on her dying day She bade my father take me to her kinsfolk far away .</p>
   <p>“ And when the priest besought her to do me no such wrong , She said , ‘ May God forgive me ! I have closed my heart too long . ’</p>
   <p>“ ‘ When I hid me from my father , and shut out my mother 's call , I sinned against those dear ones , and the Father of us all .</p>
   <p>“ ‘ Christ 's love rebukes no home-love , breaks no tie of kin apart ; Better heresy in doctrine , than heresy of heart .</p>
   <p>“ ‘ Tell me not the Church must censure : she who wept the Cross beside Never made her own flesh strangers , nor the claims of blood denied ;</p>
   <p>“ ‘ And if she who wronged her parents , with her child atones to them , Earthly daughter , Heavenly Mother ! thou at least wilt not condemn ! ’</p>
   <p>“ So , upon her death-bed lying , my blessed mother spake ; As we come to do her bidding , So receive us for her sake . ”</p>
   <p>“ God be praised ! ” said Goodwife Garvin , “ He taketh , and He gives ; He woundeth , but He healeth ; in her child our daughter lives ! ”</p>
   <p>“ Amen ! ” the old man answered , as he brushed a tear away , And , kneeling by his hearthstone , said , with reverence , “ Let us pray . ”</p>
   <p>All its Oriental symbols , and its Hebrew pararphrase , Warm with earnest life and feeling , rose his prayer of love and praise .</p>
   <p>But he started at beholding , as he rose from off his knee , The stranger cross his forehead with the sign of Papistrie .</p>
   <p>“ What is this ? ” cried Farmer Garvin . “ Is an English Christian 's home A chapel or a mass-house , that you make the sign of Rome ? ”</p>
   <p>Then the young girl knelt beside him , kissed his trembling hand , and cried : Oh , forbear to chide my father ; in that faith my mother died !</p>
   <p>“ On her wooden cross at Simcoe the dews and sunshine fall , As they fall on Spurwink 's graveyard ; and the dear God watches all ! ”</p>
   <p>The old man stroked the fair head that rested on his knee ; “ Your words , dear child , ” he answered , “ are God 's rebuke to me .</p>
   <p>“ Creed and rite perchance may differ , yet our faith and hope be one . Let me be your father 's father , let him be to me a son . ”</p>
   <p>When the horn , on Sabbath morning , through the still and frosty air , From Spurwink , Pool , and Black Point , called to sermon and to prayer ,</p>
   <p>To the goodly house of worship , where , in order due and fit , As by public vote directed , classed and ranked the people sit ;</p>
   <p>Mistress first and goodwife after , clerkly squire before the clown , “ From the brave coat , lace-embroidered , to the gray frock , shading down ; ”</p>
   <p>From the pulpit read the preacher , “ Goodman Garvin and his wife Fain would thank the Lord , whose kindness has followed them through life ,</p>
   <p>“ For the great and crowning mercy , that their daughter , from the wild , Where she rests ( they hope in God 's peace ) , has sent to them her child ;</p>
   <p>“ And the prayers of all God 's people they ask , that they may prove Not unworthy , through their weakness , of such special proof of love . ”</p>
   <p>As the preacher prayed , uprising , the aged couple stood , And the fair Canadian also , in her modest maiden - hood .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Thought the elders , grave and doubting , “ She is</l>
     <l n="2">Papist born and bred ; ”</l>
     <l n="3">Thought the young men , “ ‘ T is an angel in Mary</l>
     <l n="4">Garvin 's stead ! ”</l>

   <p>THE GARRISON OF CAPE ANN .</p>
   <p>FROM the hills of home forth looking , far beneath the tent-like span Of the sky , I see the white gleam of the headland of Cape Ann . Well I know its coves and beaches to the ebb-tide glimmering down , And the white-walled hamlet children of its ancient fishing town .</p>
   <p>Long has passed the summer morning , and its memory waxes old , When along yon breezy headlands with a pleasant friend I strolled . Ah ! the autumn sun is shining , and the ocean wind blows cool , And the golden-rod and aster bloom around thy grave , Rantoul !</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">With the memory of that morning by the summer</l>
     <l n="2">sea I blend</l>
     <l n="3">A wild and wondrous story , by the younger Mather</l>
     <l n="4">penned ,</l>
     <l n="5">In that quaint Magnalia Christi , with all strange</l>
     <l n="6">and marvellous things ,</l>
     <l n="7">Heaped up huge and undigested , like the chaos</l>
     <l n="8">Ovid sings .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Dear to me these far , faint glimpses of the dual life of old , Inward , grand with awe and reverence ; outward , mean and coarse and cold ; Gleams of mystic beauty playing over dull and vulgar clay , Golden-threaded fancies weaving in a web of hodden gray .</p>
   <p>The great eventful Present hides the Past ; but through the din Of its loud life hints and echoes from the life behind steal in ; And the lore of homeland fireside , and the legendary rhyme , Make the task of duty lighter which the true man owes his time .</p>
   <p>So , with something of the feeling which the Covenanter knew , When with pious chisel wandering Scotland 's moorland graveyards through , From the graves of old traditions I part the black - berry-vines , Wipe the moss from off the headstones , and retouch the faded lines .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Where the sea-waves back and forward , hoarse</l>
     <l n="2">with rolling pebbles , ran ,</l>
     <l n="3">The garrison-house stood watching on the gray</l>
     <l n="4">rocks of Cape Ann ;</l>
     <l n="5">On its windy site uplifting gabled roof and palisade ,</l>
     <l n="6">And rough walls of unhewn timber with the moonlight</l>
     <l n="7">overlaid .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>On his slow round walked the sentry , south and eastward looking forth O'er a rude and broken coast-line , white with breakers stretching north ,— Wood and rock and gleaming sand-drift , jagged capes , with bush and tree , Leaning inland from the smiting of the wild and gusty sea .</p>
   <p>Before the deep-mouthed chimney , dimly lit by dying brands , Twenty soldiers sat and waited , with their muskets in their hands ; On the rough-hewn oaken table the venison haunch was shared , And the pewter tankard circled slowly round from beard to beard .</p>
   <p>Long they sat and talked together ,— talked of wizards Satan-sold ; Of all ghostly sights and noises ,— signs and wonders manifold ; Of the spectre-ship of Salem , with the dead men in her shrouds , Sailing sheer above the water , in the loom of morning clouds ;</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Of the marvellous valley hidden in the depths of</l>
     <l n="2">Gloucester woods ,</l>
     <l n="3">Full of plants that love the summer ,— blooms of</l>
     <l n="4">warmer latitudes ;</l>
     <l n="5">Where the Arctic birch is braided by the tropic 's</l>
     <l n="6">flowery vines ,</l>
     <l n="7">And the white magnolia-blossoms star the twilight</l>
     <l n="8">of the pines !</l>
   </lg>
   <p>But their voices sank yet lower , sank to husky tones of fear , As they spake of present tokens of the powers of evil near ; Of a spectral host , defying stroke of steel and aim of gun ; Never yet was ball to slay them in the mould of mortals run .</p>
   <p>Thrice , with plumes and flowing scalp-locks , from the midnight wood they came ,— Thrice around the block-house marching , met , unharmed , its volleyed flame ; Then , with mocking laugh and gesture , sunk in earth or lost in air , All the ghostly wonder vanished , and the moonlit sands lay bare .</p>
   <p>Midnight came ; from out the forest moved a dusky mass that soon Grew to warriors , plumed and painted , grimly marching in the moon . “ Ghosts or witches , ” said the captain , “ thus I foil the Evil One ! ” And he rammed a silver button , from his doublet , down his gun .</p>
   <p>Once again the spectral horror moved the guarded wall about ; Once again the levelled muskets through the palisades flashed out , With that deadly aim the squirrel on his tree-top might not shun , Nor the beach-bird seaward flying with his slant wing to the sun .</p>
   <p>Like the idle rain of summer sped the harmless shower of lead . With a laugh of fierce derision , once again the phantoms fled ; Once again , without a shadow on the sands the moonlight lay , And the white smoke curling through it drifted slowly down the bay !</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ God preserve us ! ” said the captain ; “ never</l>
     <l n="2">mortal foes were there ;</l>
     <l n="3">They have vanished with their leader , Prince and</l>
     <l n="4">Power of the air !</l>
     <l n="5">Lay aside your useless weapons ; skill and prowess</l>
     <l n="6">naught avail ;</l>
     <l n="7">They who do the Devil 's service wear their master 's</l>
     <l n="8">coat of mail ! ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>So the night grew near to cock-crow , when again a warning call Roused the score of weary soldiers watching round the dusky hall And they looked to flint and priming , and they longed for break of day ; But the captain closed his Bible : “ Let us cease from man , and pray ! ”</p>
   <p>To the men who went before us , all the unseen powers seemed near , And their steadfast strength of courage struck its roots in holy fear . Every hand forsook the musket , every head was bowed and bare , Every stout knee pressed the flag-stones , as the captain led in prayer .</p>
   <p>Ceased thereat the mystic marching of the spectres round the wall , But a sound abhorred , unearthly , smote the ears and hearts of all ,— Howls of rage and shrieks of anguish ! Never after mortal man Saw the ghostly leaguers marching round the block-house of Cape Ann .</p>
   <p>So to us who walk in summer through the cool and sea-blown town , From the childhood of its people comes the solemn legend down . Not in vain the ancient fiction , in whose moral lives the youth And the fitness and the freshness of an undecaying truth .</p>
   <p>Soon or late to all our dwellings come the spectres of the mind , Doubts and fears and dread forebodings , in the darkness undefined ; Round us throng the grim projections of the heart and of the brain , And our pride of strength is weakness , and the cunning hand is vain .</p>
   <p>In the dark we cry like children ; and no answer from on high Breaks the crystal spheres of silence , and no white wings downward fly ; But the heavenly help we pray for comes to faith , and not to sight , And our prayers themselves drive backward all the spirits of the night !</p>

   <p>SKIPPER IRESON 'S RIDE .</p>
   <p>In the valuable and carefully prepared History of Marblehead , published in 1879 by Samuel Roads , Jr ., it is stated that the crew of Captain Ireson , rather than himself , were responsible for the abandonment of the disabled vessel . To screen themselves they charged their captain with the crime . In view of this the writer of the ballad addressed the following letter to the historian :—</p>
   <p>OAK KNOLL , DANVERS , 5 mo . 18 , 1880 . MY DEAR FRIEND : I heartily thank thee for a copy of thy History of Marblehead . I have read it with great interest and think good use has been made of the abundant material . No town in Essex County has a record more honorable than Marblehead ; no one has done more to develop the industrial interests of our New England seaboard , and certainly none have given such evidence of self-sacrificing patriotism . I am glad the story of it has been at last told , and told so well . I have now no doubt that thy version of Skipper Ireson 's ride is the correct one . My verse was founded solely on a fragment of rhyme which I heard from one of my early schoolmates , a native of Marblehead . I supposed the story to which it referred dated back at least a century . I knew nothing of the participators , and the narrative of the ballad was pure fancy . I am glad for the sake of truth and justice that the real facts are given in thy book . I certainly would not knowingly do injustice to any one , dead or living .</p>
   <p>I am very truly thy friend , JOHN G. WHITTIER .</p>

    <head>TELLING THE BEES .</head>
    <head>A remarkable custom , brought from the Old Country , formerly prevailed in the rural districts of New England . On the death of a member of the family , the bees were at once informed of the event , and their hives dressed in mourning . This ceremonial was supposed to be necessary to prevent the swarms from leaving their hives and seeking a new home .</head>

     <l n="8">And the white horns tossing above the wall .</l>

     <l n="9">There are the beehives ranged in the sun ;</l>

    <head>THE SWAN SONG OF PARSON AVERY .</head>
    <head>In Young 's Chronicles of Massachusetts Bay front 1623 to 1636 may be found Anthony Thacher 's Narrative of his Shipwreck . Thacher was Avery 's companion and survived to tell the tale . Mather 's Magnalia , III . 2 , gives further Particulars of Parson Avery 's End , and suggests the title of the poem .</head>
     <l n="1">WHEN the reaper 's task was ended , and the</l>
     <l n="2">summer wearing late ,</l>
     <l n="3">Parson Avery sailed from Newbury , with his wife</l>
     <l n="4">and children eight ,</l>
     <l n="5">Dropping down the river-harbor in the shallop</l>
     <l n="6">“ Watch and Wait . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Pleasantly lay the clearings in the mellow summer - morn , With the newly planted orchards dropping their fruits first-born , And the home-roofs like brown islands amid a sea of corn .</p>
   <p>Broad meadows reached out ‘ seaward the tided creeks between , And hills rolled wave-like inland , with oaks and walnuts green ;— A fairer home , a — goodlier land , his eyes had never seen .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Yet away sailed Parson Avery , away where duty led ,</l>
     <l n="2">And the voice of God seemed calling , to break the</l>
     <l n="3">living bread</l>
     <l n="4">To the souls of fishers starving on the rocks of</l>
     <l n="5">Marblehead .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>All day they sailed : at nightfall the pleasant land - breeze died , The blackening sky , at midnight , its starry lights denied , And far and low the thunder of tempest prophesied .</p>
   <p>Blotted out were all the coast-lines , gone were rock , and wood , and sand ; Grimly anxious stood the skipper with the rudder in his hand , And questioned of the darkness what was sea and what was land .</p>
   <p>And the preacher heard his dear ones , nestled round him , weeping sore , “ Never heed , my little children ! Christ is walking on before ; To the pleasant land of heaven , where the sea shall be no more . ”</p>
   <p>All at once the great cloud parted , like a curtain drawn aside , To let down the torch of lightning on the terror far and wide ; And the thunder and the whirlwind together smote the tide .</p>
   <p>There was wailing in the shallop , woman 's wail and man 's despair , A crash of breaking timbers on the rocks so sharp and bare , And , through it all , the murmur of Father Avery 's prayer .</p>
   <p>From his struggle in the darkness with the wild waves and the blast , On a rock , where every billow broke above him as it passed , Alone , of all his household , the man of God was cast .</p>
   <p>There a comrade heard him praying , in the pause of wave and wind “ All my own have gone before me , and I linger just behind ; Not for life I ask , but only for the rest Thy ransomed find !</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ In this night of death I challenge the promise of</l>
     <l n="2">Thy word !—</l>
     <l n="3">Let me see the great salvation of which mine ears</l>

   <p>The ear of God was open to His servant 's last request ; As the strong wave swept him downward the sweet hymn upward pressed , And the soul of Father Avery went , singing , to its rest .</p>
   <p>There was wailing on the mainland , from the rocks of Marblehead ; In the stricken church of Newbury the notes of prayer were read ; And long , by board and hearthstone , the living mourned the dead .</p>

   <p>MABEL MARTIN .</p>
   <p>A HARVEST IDYL .</p>
   <p>Susanna Martin , an aged woman of Amesbury , Mass ., was tried and executed for the alleged crime of witchcraft . Her home was in what is now known as Pleasant Valley on the Merrimac , a little above the old Ferry way , where , tradition says , an attempt was made to assassinate Sir Edmund Andros on his way to Falmouth ( afterward Portland ) and Pemaquid , which was frustrated by a warning timely given . Goody Martin was the only woman hanged on the north side of the Merrimac during the dreadful delusion . The aged wife of Judge Bradbury who lived on the other side of the Powow River was imprisoned and would have been put to death but for the collapse of the hideous persecution .</p>
   <p>The substance of the poem which follows was published under the name of The Witch 's Daughter , in The National Era in 1857 . In 1875 my publishers desired to issue it with illustrations , and I then enlarged it and otherwise altered it to its present form . The principal addition was in the verses which constitute Part I .</p>

   <p>THE TRUCE OF PISCATAQUA .</p>
   <p>In the winter of 1675-76 , the Eastern Indians , who had been making war upon the New Hampshire settlements , were so reduced in numbers by fighting and famine that they agreed to a peace with Major Waldron at Dover , but the peace was broken in the fall of 1676 . The famous chief , Squando , was the principal negotiator on the part of the savages . He had taken up the hatchet to revenge the brutal treatment of his child by drunken white sailors , which caused its death .</p>
   <p>It not unfrequently happened during the Border wars that young white children were adopted by their Indian captors , and so kindly treated that they were unwilling to leave the free , wild life of the woods ; and in some instances they utterly refused to go back with their parents to their old homes and civilization .</p>

    <head>COBBLER KEEZAR 'S VISION .</head>
    <head>This ballad was written on the occasion of a Horticultural Festival . Cobbler Keezar was a noted character among the first settlers in the valley of the Merrimac .</head>

     <l n="1">THE beaver cut his timber</l>

     <l n="8">To keep his waxed-ends warm .</l>
    </lg>

     <l n="9">And there , in the golden weather ,</l>
     <l n="10">He stitched and hammered and sung ;</l>
     <l n="11">In the brook he moistened his leather ,</l>
     <l n="12">In the pewter mug his tongue .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">Well knew the tough old Teuton</l>
     <l n="14">Who brewed the stoutest ale ,</l>

     <l n="21">Woodsy and wild and lonesome ,</l>

     <l n="24">Flashing in foam and spray ,—</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="25">Down on the sharp-horned ledges</l>
     <l n="26">Plunging in steep cascade ,</l>

     <l n="28">Against the hemlock 's shade .</l>

     <l n="29">Woodsy and wild and lonesome ,</l>

     <l n="33">Only here and there a clearing ,</l>

     <l n="37">No shout of home-bound reapers ,</l>

     <l n="65">Of winds in the woods , and waves on pebbled bounds ,—</l>
     <l n="66">A song for oars to chime with , such as might</l>

     <l n="68">Look from their hemlock camps , by quiet cove</l>
     <l n="69">Or beach , moon-lighted , on the waves they love .</l>

     <l n="71">On the calm bosom of some Eastern bay ,</l>

     <l n="73">Up the white sand-slopes flashed with ruddy gold . )</l>

    <head>THE COUNTESS .</head>
    <head>TO E. W .</head>
    <head>I inscribed this poem to Dr. Elias Weld of Haverhill , Massachusetts , to whose kindness I was much indebted in my boyhood . He was the one cultivated man in the neighborhood . His small but well-chosen library was placed at my disposal . He is the “ wise old doctor ” of Snow-Bound . Count Francois de Vipart with his cousin Joseph Rochemont de Poyen came to the United States in the early part of the present century . They took up their residence at Rocks Village on the Merrimac , where they both married . The wife of Count Vipart was Mary Ingalls , who as my father remembered her was a very lovely young girl . Her wedding dress , as described by a lady still living , was “ pink satin with an overdress of white lace , and white satin slippers . ” She died in less than a year after her marriage . Her husband returned to his native country . He lies buried in the family tomb of the Viparts at Bordeaux .</head>

     <l n="4">Or , called at last , art now Heaven 's citizen ;</l>
     <l n="5">But , here or there , a pleasant thought of thee ,</l>
     <l n="6">Like an old friend , all day has been with me .</l>
     <l n="7">The shy , still boy , for whom thy kindly hand</l>
     <l n="8">Smoothed his hard pathway to the wonder-land</l>
     <l n="9">Of thought and fancy , in gray manhood yet</l>
     <l n="10">Keeps green the memory of his early debt .</l>
     <l n="11">To-day , when truth and falsehood speak their words</l>

     <l n="14">To each sharp clause of that stern argument ,</l>

     <l n="16">Of the old pastoral music round me float ,</l>
     <l n="17">While through the hot gleam of our civil strife</l>
     <l n="18">Looms the green mirage of a simpler life .</l>
     <l n="19">As , at his alien post , the sentinel</l>
     <l n="20">Drops the old bucket in the homestead well ,</l>
     <l n="21">And hears old voices in the winds that toss</l>
     <l n="22">Above his head the live-oak 's beard of moss ,</l>

     <l n="30">Whose ancient sulky down the village lanes</l>

     <l n="36">Of each small brook , and what the hillside trees</l>

   <p>AMONG THE HILLS</p>
   <p>This poem , when originally published , was dedicated to Annie Fields , wife of the distinguished publisher , James T. Fields , of Boston , in grateful acknowledgment of the strength and inspiration I have found in her friendship and sympathy . The poem in its first form was entitled The Wife : an Idyl of Bearcamp Water , and appeared in The Atlantic Monthly for January , 1868 . When I published the volume Among the Hills , in December of the same year , I expanded the Prelude and filled out also the outlines of the story .</p>

     <l n="17">Defied the dog-star . Through the open door</l>

     <l n="54">Nightshade and rough-leaved burdock in the place</l>
     <l n="55">Of the sweet doorway greeting of the rose</l>
     <l n="56">And honeysuckle , where the house walls seemed</l>

     <l n="59">Across the curtainless windows , from whose panes</l>

     <l n="61">Within , the cluttered kitchen-floor , unwashed</l>
     <l n="62">( Broom-clean I think they called it ) ; the best room</l>

     <l n="87">And winter pork with the least possible outlay</l>
     <l n="88">Of salt and sanctity ; in daily life</l>
     <l n="89">Showing as little actual comprehension</l>
     <l n="90">Of Christian charity and love and duty ,</l>

     <l n="1">THE Rabbi Nathan two-score years and ten</l>
     <l n="2">Walked blameless through the evil world , and then ,</l>
     <l n="3">Just as the almond blossomed in his hair ,</l>
     <l n="4">Met a temptation all too strong to bear ,</l>
     <l n="5">And miserably sinned . So , adding not</l>
     <l n="6">Falsehood to guilt , he left his seat , and taught</l>
     <l n="7">No more among the elders , but went out</l>
     <l n="8">From the great congregation girt about</l>
     <l n="9">With sackcloth , and with ashes on his head ,</l>
     <l n="10">Making his gray locks grayer . Long he prayed ,</l>
     <l n="11">Smiting his breast ; then , as the Book he laid</l>
     <l n="12">Open before him for the Bath-Col 's choice ,</l>
     <l n="13">Pausing to hear that Daughter of a Voice ,</l>

     <l n="16">And for the evil day thy brother lives . ”</l>
     <l n="17">Marvelling , he said : “ It is the Lord who gives</l>
     <l n="18">Counsel in need . At Ecbatana dwells</l>
     <l n="19">Rabbi Ben Isaac , who all men excels</l>
     <l n="20">In righteousness and wisdom , as the trees</l>

     <l n="27">Suddenly in the darkness feels a hand</l>
     <l n="28">Thrill with its touch his own , and his cheek fanned</l>

    <head>NOREMBEGA .</head>
    <head>Norembega , or Norimbegue , is the name given by early French fishermen and explorers to a fabulous country south of Cape Breton , first discovered by Verrazzani in 1524 . It was supposed to have a magnificent city of the same name on a great river , probably the Penobscot . The site of this barbaric city is laid down on a map published at Antwerp in 1570 . In 1604 Champlain sailed in search of the Northern Eldorado , twenty-two leagues up the Penobscot from the Isle Haute . He supposed the river to be that of Norembega , but wisely came to the conclusion that those travellers who told of the great city had never seen it . He saw no evidences of anything like civilization , but mentions the finding of a cross , very old and mossy , in the woods .</head>

    <head>MIRIAM .</head>
    <head>TO FREDERICK A. P. BARNARD .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">THE years are many since , in youth and hope ,</l>
     <l n="2">Under the Charter Oak , our horoscope</l>
     <l n="3">We drew thick-studded with all favoring stars .</l>
     <l n="4">Now , with gray beards , and faces seamed with scars</l>
     <l n="5">From life 's hard battle , meeting once again ,</l>
     <l n="6">We smile , half sadly , over dreams so vain ;</l>
     <l n="7">Knowing , at last , that it is not in man</l>
     <l n="8">Who walketh to direct his steps , or plan</l>
     <l n="9">His permanent house of life . Alike we loved</l>
     <l n="10">The muses ’ haunts , and all our fancies moved</l>
     <l n="11">To measures of old song . How since that day</l>
     <l n="12">Our feet have parted from the path that lay</l>
     <l n="13">So fair before us ! Rich , from lifelong search</l>
     <l n="14">Of truth , within thy Academic porch</l>
     <l n="15">Thou sittest now , lord of a realm of fact ,</l>
     <l n="16">Thy servitors the sciences exact ;</l>
     <l n="17">Still listening with thy hand on Nature 's keys ,</l>
     <l n="18">To hear the Samian 's spheral harmonies</l>
     <l n="19">And rhythm of law . I called from dream and song ,</l>
     <l n="20">Thank God ! so early to a strife so long ,</l>
     <l n="21">That , ere it closed , the black , abundant hair</l>
     <l n="22">Of boyhood rested silver-sown and spare</l>
     <l n="23">On manhood 's temples , now at sunset-chime</l>
     <l n="24">Tread with fond feet the path of morning time .</l>
     <l n="25">And if perchance too late I linger where</l>
     <l n="26">The flowers have ceased to blow , and trees are bare ,</l>
     <l n="27">Thou , wiser in thy choice , wilt scarcely blame</l>
     <l n="28">The friend who shields his folly with thy name .</l>

     <l n="31">One Sabbath day my friend and I</l>
     <l n="32">After the meeting , quietly</l>
     <l n="33">Passed from the crowded village lanes ,</l>
     <l n="34">White with dry dust for lack of rains ,</l>
     <l n="35">And climbed the neighboring slope , with feet</l>
     <l n="36">Slackened and heavy from the heat ,</l>
     <l n="37">Although the day was wellnigh done ,</l>
     <l n="38">And the low angle of the sun</l>
     <l n="39">Along the naked hillside cast</l>
     <l n="40">Our shadows as of giants vast .</l>
     <l n="41">We reached , at length , the topmost swell ,</l>
     <l n="42">Whence , either way , the green turf fell</l>
     <l n="43">In terraces of nature down</l>
     <l n="44">To fruit-hung orchards , and the town</l>
     <l n="45">With white , pretenceless houses , tall</l>
     <l n="46">Church-steeples , and , o'ershadowing all ,</l>
     <l n="47">Huge mills whose windows had the look</l>
     <l n="48">Of eager eyes that ill could brook</l>
     <l n="49">The Sabbath rest . We traced the track</l>
     <l n="50">Of the sea-seeking river back ,</l>
     <l n="51">Glistening for miles above its mouth ,</l>
     <l n="52">Through the long valley to the south ,</l>
     <l n="53">And , looking eastward , cool to view ,</l>
     <l n="54">Stretched the illimitable blue</l>
     <l n="55">Of ocean , from its curved coast-line ;</l>
     <l n="56">Sombred and still , the warm sunshine</l>
     <l n="57">Filled with pale gold-dust all the reach</l>
     <l n="58">Of slumberous woods from hill to beach ,—</l>
     <l n="59">Slanted on walls of thronged retreats</l>
     <l n="60">From city toil and dusty streets ,</l>
     <l n="61">On grassy bluff , and dune of sand ,</l>
     <l n="62">And rocky islands miles from land ;</l>
     <l n="63">Touched the far-glancing sails , and showed</l>
     <l n="64">White lines of foam where long waves flowed</l>
     <l n="65">Dumb in the distance . In the north ,</l>
     <l n="66">Dim through their misty hair , looked forth</l>
     <l n="67">The space-dwarfed mountains to the sea ,</l>
     <l n="68">From mystery to mystery !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="69">So , sitting on that green hill-slope ,</l>
     <l n="70">We talked of human life , its hope</l>
     <l n="71">And fear , and unsolved doubts , and what</l>
     <l n="72">It might have been , and yet was not .</l>
     <l n="73">And , when at last the evening air</l>
     <l n="74">Grew sweeter for the bells of prayer</l>
     <l n="75">Ringing in steeples far below ,</l>
     <l n="76">We watched the people churchward go ,</l>
     <l n="77">Each to his place , as if thereon</l>
     <l n="78">The true shekinah only shone ;</l>
     <l n="79">And my friend queried how it came</l>
     <l n="80">To pass that they who owned the same</l>
     <l n="81">Great Master still could not agree</l>
     <l n="82">To worship Him in company .</l>
     <l n="83">Then , broadening in his thought , he ran</l>
     <l n="84">Over the whole vast field of man ,—</l>
     <l n="85">The varying forms of faith and creed</l>
     <l n="86">That somehow served the holders ’ need ;</l>
     <l n="87">In which , unquestioned , undenied ,</l>
     <l n="88">Uncounted millions lived and died ;</l>
     <l n="89">The bibles of the ancient folk ,</l>
     <l n="90">Through which the heart of nations spoke ;</l>
     <l n="91">The old moralities which lent</l>
     <l n="92">To home its sweetness and content ,</l>
     <l n="93">And rendered possible to bear</l>
     <l n="94">The life of peoples everywhere</l>
     <l n="95">And asked if we , who boast of light ,</l>
     <l n="96">Claim not a too exclusive right</l>
     <l n="97">To truths which must for all be meant ,</l>
     <l n="98">Like rain and sunshine freely sent .</l>
     <l n="99">In bondage to the letter still ,</l>
     <l n="100">We give it power to cramp and kill ,—</l>
     <l n="101">To tax God 's fulness with a scheme</l>
     <l n="102">Narrower than Peter 's house-top dream ,</l>
     <l n="103">His wisdom and his love with plans</l>
     <l n="104">Poor and inadequate as man 's .</l>
     <l n="105">It must be that He witnesses</l>
     <l n="106">Somehow to all men that He is</l>
     <l n="107">That something of His saving grace</l>
     <l n="108">Reaches the lowest of the race ,</l>
     <l n="109">Who , through strange creed and rite , may draw</l>
     <l n="110">The hints of a diviner law .</l>
     <l n="111">We walk in clearer light ;— but then ,</l>
     <l n="112">Is He not God ?— are they not men ?</l>
     <l n="113">Are His responsibilities</l>
     <l n="114">For us alone and not for these ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">

     <l n="118">The tokens of its unity .</l>
     <l n="119">No scroll of creed its fulness wraps ,</l>
     <l n="120">We trace it not by school-boy maps ,</l>
     <l n="121">Free as the sun and air it is</l>
     <l n="122">Of latitudes and boundaries .</l>
     <l n="123">In Vedic verse , in dull Koran ,</l>
     <l n="124">Are messages of good to man ;</l>
     <l n="125">The angels to our Aryan sires</l>
     <l n="126">Talked by the earliest household fires ;</l>
     <l n="127">The prophets of the elder day ,</l>
     <l n="128">The slant-eyed sages of Cathay ,</l>

     <l n="135">Denying not the proven seers ,</l>
     <l n="136">The tested wisdom of the years ;</l>
     <l n="137">Confirming with his own impress</l>

     <l n="147">And all our treasure of old thought</l>
     <l n="148">In His harmonious fulness wrought</l>
     <l n="149">Who gathers in one sheaf complete</l>
     <l n="150">The scattered blades of God 's sown wheat ,</l>

    <head>NAUHAUGHT , THE DEACON .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">NAUHAUGHT , the Indian deacon , who of old</l>
     <l n="2">Dwelt , poor but blameless , where his narrowing Cape</l>
     <l n="3">Stretches its shrunk arm out to all the winds</l>
     <l n="4">And the relentless smiting of the waves ,</l>
     <l n="5">Awoke one morning from a pleasant dream</l>
     <l n="6">Of a good angel dropping in his hand</l>
     <l n="7">A fair , broad gold-piece , in the name of God .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="8">He rose and went forth with the early day</l>
     <l n="9">Far inland , where the voices of the waves</l>
     <l n="10">Mellowed and Mingled with the whispering leaves ,</l>
     <l n="11">As , through the tangle of the low , thick woods ,</l>
     <l n="12">He searched his traps . Therein nor beast nor bird</l>
     <l n="13">He found ; though meanwhile in the reedy pools</l>
     <l n="14">The otter plashed , and underneath the pines</l>
     <l n="15">The partridge drummed : and as his thoughts went back</l>
     <l n="16">To the sick wife and little child at home ,</l>
     <l n="17">What marvel that the poor man felt his faith</l>
     <l n="18">Too weak to bear its burden ,— like a rope</l>
     <l n="19">That , strand by strand uncoiling , breaks above</l>
     <l n="20">The hand that grasps it . “ Even now , O Lord !</l>
     <l n="21">Send me , ” he prayed , “ the angel of my dream !</l>
     <l n="22">Nauhaught is very poor ; he cannot wait . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="23">Even as he spake he heard at his bare feet</l>
     <l n="24">A low , metallic clink , and , looking down ,</l>
     <l n="25">He saw a dainty purse with disks of gold</l>
     <l n="26">Crowding its silken net . Awhile he held</l>
     <l n="27">The treasure up before his eyes , alone</l>
     <l n="28">With his great need , feeling the wondrous coins</l>
     <l n="29">Slide through his eager fingers , one by one .</l>
     <l n="30">So then the dream was true . The angel brought</l>
     <l n="31">One broad piece only ; should he take all these ?</l>
     <l n="32">Who would be wiser , in the blind , dumb woods ?</l>
     <l n="33">The loser , doubtless rich , would scarcely miss</l>
     <l n="34">This dropped crumb from a table always full .</l>
     <l n="35">Still , while he mused , he seemed to hear the cry</l>
     <l n="36">Of a starved child ; the sick face of his wife</l>
     <l n="37">Tempted him . Heart and flesh in fierce revolt</l>
     <l n="38">Urged the wild license of his savage youth</l>
     <l n="39">Against his later scruples . Bitter toil ,</l>
     <l n="40">Prayer , fasting , dread of blame , and pitiless eyes</l>
     <l n="41">To watch his halting ,— had he lost for these</l>
     <l n="42">The freedom of the woods ;— the hunting-grounds</l>
     <l n="43">Of happy spirits for a walled-in heaven</l>
     <l n="44">Of everlasting psalms ? One healed the sick</l>
     <l n="45">Very far off thousands of moons ago</l>
     <l n="46">Had he not prayed him night and day to come</l>
     <l n="47">And cure his bed-bound wife ? Was there a hell ?</l>
     <l n="48">Were all his fathers ’ people writhing there —</l>
     <l n="49">Like the poor shell-fish set to boil alive —</l>
     <l n="50">Forever , dying never ? If he kept</l>
     <l n="51">This gold , so needed , would the dreadful God</l>
     <l n="52">Torment him like a Mohawk 's captive stuck</l>
     <l n="53">With slow-consuming splinters ? Would the saints</l>
     <l n="54">And the white angels dance and laugh to see him</l>
     <l n="55">Burn like a pitch-pine torch ? His Christian garb</l>
     <l n="56">Seemed falling from him ; with the fear and shame</l>
     <l n="57">Of Adam naked at the cool of day ,</l>
     <l n="58">He gazed around . A black snake lay in coil</l>
     <l n="59">On the hot sand , a crow with sidelong eye</l>
     <l n="60">Watched from a dead bough . All his Indian lore</l>
     <l n="61">Of evil blending with a convert 's faith</l>
     <l n="62">In the supernal terrors of the Book ,</l>
     <l n="63">He saw the Tempter in the coiling snake</l>
     <l n="64">And ominous , black-winged bird ; and all the while</l>
     <l n="65">The low rebuking of the distant waves</l>
     <l n="66">Stole in upon him like the voice of God</l>
     <l n="67">Among the trees of Eden . Girding up</l>
     <l n="68">His soul 's loins with a resolute hand , he thrust</l>
     <l n="69">The base thought from him : “ Nauhaught , be a man</l>
     <l n="70">Starve , if need be ; but , while you live , look out</l>
     <l n="71">From honest eyes on all men , unashamed .</l>
     <l n="72">God help me ! I am deacon of the church ,</l>
     <l n="73">A baptized , praying Indian ! Should I do</l>
     <l n="74">This secret meanness , even the barken knots</l>
     <l n="75">Of the old trees would turn to eyes to see it ,</l>
     <l n="76">The birds would tell of it , and all the leaves</l>
     <l n="77">Whisper above me : ‘ Nauhaught is a thief ! ’</l>
     <l n="78">The sun would know it , and the stars that hide</l>
     <l n="79">Behind his light would watch me , and at night</l>
     <l n="80">Follow me with their sharp , accusing eyes .</l>
     <l n="81">Yea , thou , God , seest me ! ” Then Nauhaught drew</l>
     <l n="82">Closer his belt of leather , dulling thus</l>
     <l n="83">The pain of hunger , and walked bravely back</l>
     <l n="84">To the brown fishing-hamlet by the sea ;</l>
     <l n="85">And , pausing at the inn-door , cheerily asked</l>
     <l n="86">“ Who hath lost aught to-day ? ”</l>
     <l n="87">“ I , ” said a voice ;</l>
     <l n="88">“ Ten golden pieces , in a silken purse ,</l>
     <l n="89">My daughter 's handiwork . ” He looked , and to</l>
     <l n="90">One stood before him in a coat of frieze ,</l>
     <l n="91">And the glazed hat of a seafaring man ,</l>
     <l n="92">Shrewd-faced , broad-shouldered , with no trace of wings .</l>
     <l n="93">Marvelling , he dropped within the stranger 's hand</l>
     <l n="94">The silken web , and turned to go his way .</l>
     <l n="95">But the man said : “ A tithe at least is yours ;</l>
     <l n="96">Take it in God 's name as an honest man . ”</l>
     <l n="97">And as the deacon 's dusky fingers closed</l>
     <l n="98">Over the golden gift , “ Yea , in God 's name</l>
     <l n="99">I take it , with a poor man 's thanks , ” he said .</l>
     <l n="100">So down the street that , like a river of sand ,</l>
     <l n="101">Ran , white in sunshine , to the summer sea ,</l>
     <l n="102">He sought his home singing and praising God ;</l>
     <l n="103">And when his neighbors in their careless way</l>
     <l n="104">Spoke of the owner of the silken purse —</l>
     <l n="105">A Wellfleet skipper , known in every port</l>
     <l n="106">That the Cape opens in its sandy wall —</l>
     <l n="107">He answered , with a wise smile , to himself</l>
     <l n="108">“ I saw the angel where they see a man . ”</l>

   <p>MARGUERITE .</p>
   <p>MASSACHUSETTS BAY , 1760 .</p>
   <p>Upwards of one thousand of the Acadian peasants forcibly taken from their homes on the Gaspereau and Basin of Minas were assigned to the several towns of the Massachusetts colony , the children being bound by the authorities to service or labor .</p>
   <p>THE robins sang in the orchard , the buds into blossoms grew ; Little of human sorrow the buds and the robins knew ! Sick , in an alien household , the poor French neutral lay ; Into her lonesome garret fell the light of the April day , Through the dusty window , curtained by the spider 's warp and woof , On the loose-laid floor of hemlock , on oaken ribs of roof , The bedquilt 's faded patchwork , the teacups on the stand , The wheel with flaxen tangle , as it dropped from her sick hand .</p>
   <p>What to her was the song of the robin , or warm morning light , As she lay in the trance of the dying , heedless of sound or sight ?</p>
   <p>Done was the work of her bands , she had eaten her bitter bread ; The world of the alien people lay behind her dim and dead .</p>
   <p>But her soul went back to its child-time ; she saw the sun o'erflow With gold the Basin of Minas , and set over Gaspereau ;</p>
   <p>The low , bare flats at ebb-tide , the rush of the sea at flood , Through inlet and creek and river , from dike to upland wood ;</p>
   <p>The gulls in the red of morning , the fish-hawk 's rise and fall , The drift of the fog in moonshine , over the dark coast-wall .</p>
   <p>She saw the face of her mother , she heard the song she sang ; And far off , faintly , slowly , the bell for vespers rang .</p>
   <p>By her bed the hard-faced mistress sat , smoothing the wrinkled sheet , Peering into the face , so helpless , and feeling the ice-cold feet .</p>
   <p>With a vague remorse atoning for her greed and long abuse , By care no longer heeded and pity too late for use .</p>
   <p>Up the stairs of the garret softly the son of the mistress stepped , Leaned over the head-board , covering his face with his hands , and wept .</p>
   <p>Outspake the mother , who watched him sharply , with brow a-frown “ What ! love you the Papist , the beggar , the charge of the town ? ”</p>
   <p>Be she Papist or beggar who lies here , I know and God knows I love her , and fain would go with her wherever she goes !</p>
   <p>“ O mother ! that sweet face came pleading , for love so athirst . You saw but the town-charge ; I knew her God 's angel at first . ”</p>
   <p>Shaking her gray head , the mistress hushed down a bitter cry ; And awed by the silence and shadow of death drawing nigh ,</p>
   <p>She murmured a psalm of the Bible ; but closer the young girl pressed , With the last of her life in her fingers , the cross to her breast .</p>
   <p>“ My son , come away , ” cried the mother , her voice cruel grown . “ She is joined to her idols , like Ephraim ; let her alone ! ”</p>
   <p>But he knelt with his hand on her forehead , his lips to her ear , And he called back the soul that was passing “ Marguerite , do you hear ? ”</p>
   <p>She paused on the threshold of Heaven ; love , pity , surprise , Wistful , tender , lit up for an instant the cloud of her eyes .</p>
   <p>With his heart on his lips he kissed her , but never her cheek grew red , And the words the living long for he spake in the ear of the dead .</p>
   <p>And the robins sang in the orchard , where buds to blossoms grew ; Of the folded hands and the still face never the robins knew !</p>

    <head>THE PENNSYLVANIA PILGRIM .</head>
    <head>INTRODUCTORY NOTE .</head>
    <head>THE beginning of German emigration to America may be traced to the personal influence of William Penn , who in 1677 visited the Continent , and made the acquaintance of an intelligent and highly cultivated circle of Pietists , or Mystics , who , reviving in the seventeenth century the spiritual faith and worship of Tauler and the “ Friends of God ” in the fourteenth , gathered about the pastor Spener , and the young and beautiful Eleonora Johanna Von Merlau . In this circle originated the Frankfort Land Company , which bought of William Penn , the Governor of Pennsylvania , a tract of land near the new city of Philadelphia . The company 's agent in the New World was a rising young lawyer , Francis Daniel Pastorius , son of Judge Pastorius , of Windsheim , who , at the age of seventeen , entered the University of Altorf . He studied law at , Strasburg , Basle , and Jena , and at Ratisbon , the seat of the Imperial Government , obtained a practical knowledge of international polity . Successful in all his examinations and disputations , he received the degree of Doctor of Law at Nuremberg in 1676 . In 1679 he was a law-lecturer at Frankfort , where he became deeply interested in the teachings of Dr. Spener . In 1680-81 he travelled in France , England , Ireland , and Italy with his friend Herr Von Rodeck . “ I was , ” he says , “ glad to enjoy again the company of my Christian friends , rather than be with Von Rodeck feasting and dancing . ” In 1683 , in company with a small number of German Friends , he emigrated to America , settling upon the Frankfort Company 's tract between the Schuylkill and the Delaware rivers . The township was divided into four hamlets , namely , Germantown , Krisheim , Crefield , and Sommerhausen . Soon after his arrival he united himself with the Society of Friends , and became one of its most able and devoted members , as well as the recognized head and lawgiver of the settlement . He married , two years after his arrival , Anneke ( Anna ) , daughter of Dr. Klosterman , of Muhlheim . In the year 1688 he drew up a memorial against slaveholding , which was adopted by the Germantown Friends and sent up to the Monthly Meeting , and thence to the Yearly Meeting at Philadelphia . It is noteworthy as the first protest made by a religious body against Negro Slavery . The original document was discovered in 1844 by the Philadelphia antiquarian , Nathan Kite , and published in The Friend ( Vol . XVIII . No . 16 ) . It is a bold and direct appeal to the best instincts of the heart . “ Have not , ” he asks , “ these negroes as much right to fight for their freedom as you have to keep them slaves ? ” Under the wise direction of Pastorius , the German-town settlement grew and prospered . The inhabitants planted orchards and vineyards , and surrounded themselves with souvenirs of their old home . A large number of them were linen-weavers , as well as small farmers . The Quakers were the principal sect , but men of all religions were tolerated , and lived together in harmony . In 1692 Richard Frame published , in what he called verse , a Description of Pennsylvania , in which he alludes to the settlement :—</head>
     <l n="1">“ The German town of which I spoke before ,</l>
     <l n="2">Which is at least in length one mile or more ,</l>
     <l n="3">Where lives High German people and Low Dutch ,</l>
     <l n="4">Whose trade in weaving linen cloth is much ,</l>
     <l n="5">— There grows the flax , as also you may know</l>
     <l n="6">That from the same they do divide the tow .</l>
     <l n="7">Their trade suits well their habitation ,</l>
     <l n="8">We find convenience for their occupation . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Pastorius seems to have been on intimate terms with William Penn , Thomas Lloyd , Chief Justice Logan , Thomas Story , and other leading men in the Province belonging to his own religious society , as also with Kelpius , the learned Mystic of the Wissahickon , with the pastor of the Swedes ’ church , and the leaders of the Mennonites . He wrote a description of Pennsylvania , which was published at Frankfort and Leipsic in 1700 and 1701 . His Lives of the Saints , etc ., written in German and dedicated to Professor Schurmberg , his old teacher , was published in 1690 . He left behind him many unpublished manuscripts covering a very wide range of subjects , most of which are now lost . One huge manuscript folio , entitled Hive Beestock , Melliotropheum Alucar , or Rusca Apium , still remains , containing one thousand pages with about one hundred lines to a page . It is a medley of knowledge and fancy , history , philosophy , and poetry , written in seven languages . A large portion of his poetry is devoted to the pleasures of gardening , the description of flowers , and the care of bees . The following specimen of his punning Latin is addressed to an orchard-pilferer :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Quisquis in haec furtim reptas viridaria nostra</l>
     <l n="2">Tangere fallaci poma caveto mane ,</l>
     <l n="3">Si non obsequeris faxit Deus omne quod opto ,</l>
     <l n="4">Cum malis nostris ut mala cuncta feras . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Professor Oswald Seidensticker , to whose papers in Der Deutsche Pioneer and that able periodical the Penn Monthly , of Philadelphia , I am indebted for many of the foregoing facts in regard to the German pilgrims of the New World , thus closes his notice of Pastorius :— “ No tombstone , not even a record of burial , indicates where his remains have found their last resting-place , and the pardonable desire to associate the homage due to this distinguished man with some visible memento can not be gratified . There is no reason to suppose that he was interred in any other place than the Friends ’ old burying-ground in Germantown , though the fact is not attested by any definite source of information . After all , this obliteration of the last trace of his earthly existence is but typical of what has overtaken the times which he represents ; that Germantown which he founded , which saw him live and move , is at present but a quaint idyl of the past , almost a myth , barely remembered and little cared for by the keener race that has succeeded . The Pilgrims of Plymouth have not lacked historian and poet . Justice has been done to their faith , courage , and self-sacrifice , and to the mighty influence of their endeavors to establish righteousness on the earth . The Quaker pilgrims of Pennsylvania , seeking the same object by different means , have not been equally fortunate . The power of their testimony for truth and holiness , peace and freedom , enforced only by what Milton calls “ the unresistible might of meekness , ” has been felt through two centuries in the amelioration of penal severities , the abolition of slavery , the reform of the erring , the relief of the poor and suffering ,— felt , in brief , in every step of human progress . But of the men themselves , with the single exception of William Penn , scarcely anything is known . Contrasted , from the outset , with the stern , aggressive Puritans of New England , they have come to be regarded as “ a feeble folk , ” with a personality as doubtful as their unrecorded graves . They were not soldiers , like Miles Standish ; they had no figure so picturesque as Vane , no leader so rashly brave and haughty as Endicott . No Cotton Mather wrote their Magnalia ; they had no awful drama of supernaturalism in which Satan and his angels were actors ; and the only witch mentioned in their simple annals was a poor old Swedish woman , who , on complaint of her countrywomen , was tried and acquitted of everything but imbecility and folly . Nothing but common-place offices of civility came to pass between them and the Indians ; indeed , their enemies taunted them with the fact that the savages did not regard them as Christians , but just such men as themselves . Yet it must be apparent to every careful observer of the progress of American civilization that its two principal currents had their sources in the entirely opposite directions of the Puritan and Quaker colonies . To use the words of a late writer : ( 1 ) “ The historical forces , with which no others may be compared in their influence on the people , have been those of the Puritan and the Quaker . The strength of the one was in the confession of an invisible Presence , a righteous , eternal Will , which would establish righteousness on earth ; and thence arose the conviction of a direct personal responsibility , which could be tempted by no external splendor and could be shaken by no internal agitation , and could not be evaded or transferred . The strength of the other was the witness in the human spirit to an eternal Word , an Inner Voice which spoke to each alone , while yet it spoke to every man ; a Light which each was to follow , and which yet was the light of the world ; and all other voices were silent before this , and the solitary path whither it led was more sacred than the worn ways of cathedral-aisles . ” It will be sufficiently apparent to the reader that , in the poem which follows , I have attempted nothing beyond a study of the life and times of the Pennsylvania colonist ,— a simple picture of a noteworthy man and his locality . The colors of my sketch are all very sober , toned down to the quiet and dreamy atmosphere through which its subject is visible . Whether , in the glare and tumult of the present time , such a picture will find favor may well be questioned . I only know that it has beguiled for me some hours of weariness , and that , whatever may be its measure of public appreciation , it has been to me its own reward . J. G. W. AMESBURY , 5th mo ., 1872 .</p>

    <head>KING VOLMER AND ELSIE .</head>
    <head>AFTER THE DANISH OF CHRISTIAN WINTER .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">WHERE , over heathen doom-rings and gray stones</l>
     <l n="2">of the Horg ,</l>
     <l n="3">In its little Christian city stands the church of</l>
     <l n="4">Vordingborg ,</l>
     <l n="5">In merry mood King Volmer sat , forgetful of his</l>
     <l n="6">power ,</l>
     <l n="7">As idle as the Goose of Gold that brooded on his</l>
     <l n="8">tower .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">Out spake the King to Henrik , his young and faithful</l>
     <l n="10">squire</l>
     <l n="11">“ Dar'st trust thy little Elsie , the maid of thy</l>
     <l n="12">desire ? ”</l>
     <l n="13">“ Of all the men in Denmark she loveth only me</l>
     <l n="14">As true to me is Elsie as thy Lily is to thee . ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Loud laughed the king : “ To-morrow shall bring another day , ( 18 ) When I myself will test her ; she will not say me nay . ” Thereat the lords and gallants , that round about him stood , Wagged all their heads in concert and smiled as courtiers should .</p>
   <p>The gray lark sings o'er Vordingborg , and on the ancient town From the tall tower of Valdemar the Golden Goose looks down ; The yellow grain is waving in the pleasant wind of morn , The wood resounds with cry of hounds and blare of hunter 's horn .</p>
   <p>In the garden of her father little Elsie sits and spins , And , singing with the early birds , her daily task , begins . Gay tulips bloom and sweet mint curls around her garden-bower , But she is sweeter than the mint and fairer than the flower .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">About her form her kirtle blue clings lovingly , and ,</l>
     <l n="2">white</l>
     <l n="3">As snow , her loose sleeves only leave her small ,</l>
     <l n="4">round wrists in sight ;</l>
     <l n="5">Below , the modest petticoat can only half conceal</l>
     <l n="6">The motion of the lightest foot that ever turned a</l>
     <l n="7">wheel .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The cat sits purring at her side , bees hum in sunshine warm ; But , look ! she starts , she lifts her face , she shades it with her arm . And , hark ! a train of horsemen , with sound of dog and horn , Come leaping o'er the ditches , come trampling down the corn !</p>
   <p>Merrily rang the bridle-reins , and scarf and plume streamed gay , As fast beside her father 's gate the riders held their way ; And one was brave in scarlet cloak , with golden spur on heel , And , as he checked his foaming steed , the maiden checked her wheel .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ All hail among thy roses , the fairest rose to me !</l>
     <l n="2">For weary months in secret my heart has longed for</l>
     <l n="3">thee ! ”</l>
     <l n="4">What noble knight was this ? What words for</l>
     <l n="5">modest maiden 's ear ?</l>
     <l n="6">She dropped a lowly courtesy of bashfulness and</l>
     <l n="7">fear .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>She lifted up her spinning-wheel ; she fain would seek the door , Trembling in every limb , her cheek with blushes crimsoned o'er . “ Nay , fear me not , ” the rider said , “ I offer heart and hand , Bear witness these good Danish knights who round about me stand .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ I grant you time to think of this , to answer as</l>
     <l n="2">you may ,</l>
     <l n="3">For to-morrow , little Elsie , shall bring another day . ”</l>
     <l n="4">He spake the old phrase slyly as , glancing round</l>
     <l n="5">his train ,</l>
     <l n="6">He saw his merry followers seek to hide their</l>
     <l n="7">smiles in vain .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>“ The snow of pearls I 'll scatter in your curls of golden hair , I 'll line with furs the velvet of the kirtle that you wear ; All precious gems shall twine your neck ; and in a chariot gay You shall ride , my little Elsie , behind four steeds of gray .</p>
   <p>“ And harps shall sound , and flutes shall play , and brazen lamps shall glow ; On marble floors your feet shall weave the dances to and fro . At frosty eventide for us the blazing hearth shall shine , While , at our ease , we play at draughts , and drink the blood-red wine . ”</p>
   <p>Then Elsie raised her head and met her wooer face to face ; A roguish smile shone in her eye and on her lip found place . Back from her low white forehead the curls of gold she threw , And lifted up her eyes to his , steady and clear and blue .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ I am a lowly peasant , and you a gallant knight ;</l>
     <l n="2">I will not trust a love that soon may cool and turn</l>
     <l n="3">to slight .</l>
     <l n="4">If you would wed me henceforth be a peasant , not</l>
     <l n="5">a lord ;</l>
     <l n="6">I bid you hang upon the wall your tried and trusty</l>
     <l n="7">sword . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>“ To please you , Elsie , I will lay keen Dynadel away , And in its place will swing the scythe and mow your father 's hay . ” “ Nay , but your gallant scarlet cloak my eyes can never bear ; A Vadmal coat , so plain and gray , is all that you must wear . ”</p>
   <p>“ Well , Vadmal will I wear for you , ” the rider gayly spoke , “ And on the Lord 's high altar I 'll lay my scarlet cloak . ” “ But mark , ” she said , “ no stately horse my peasant love must ride , A yoke of steers before the plough is all that he must guide . ”</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">The knight looked down upon his steed : “ Well ,</l>
     <l n="2">let him wander free</l>
     <l n="3">No other man must ride the horse that has been</l>
     <l n="4">backed by me .</l>
     <l n="5">Henceforth I 'll tread the furrow and to my oxen</l>
     <l n="6">talk ,</l>
     <l n="7">If only little Elsie beside my plough will walk . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>“ You must take from out your cellar cask of wine and flask and can ; The homely mead I brew you may serve a peasant . man . ” “ Most willingly , fair Elsie , I 'll drink that mead of thine , And leave my minstrel 's thirsty throat to drain my generous wine . ”</p>
   <p>“ Now break your shield asunder , and shatter sign and boss , Unmeet for peasant-wedded arms , your knightly knee across . And pull me down your castle from top to basement wall , And let your plough trace furrows in the ruins of your hall ! ”</p>
   <p>Then smiled he with a lofty pride ; right well at last he knew The maiden of the spinning-wheel was to her troth . plight true . “ Ah , roguish little Elsie ! you act your part full well You know that I must bear my shield and in my castle dwell !</p>
   <p>“ The lions ramping on that shield between the hearts aflame Keep watch o'er Denmark 's honor , and guard her ancient name .</p>
   <p>“ For know that I am Volmer ; I dwell in yonder towers , Who ploughs them ploughs up Denmark , this goodly home of ours ’ .</p>
   <p>“ I tempt no more , fair Elsie ! your heart I know is true ; Would God that all our maidens were good and pure as you ! Well have you pleased your monarch , and he shall well repay ; God 's peace ! Farewell ! To-morrow will bring another day ! ”</p>
   <p>He lifted up his bridle hand , he spurred his good steed then , And like a whirl-blast swept away with all his gallant men . The steel hoofs beat the rocky path ; again on winds of morn The wood resounds with cry of hounds and blare of hunter 's horn .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Thou true and ever faithful ! ” the listening</l>
     <l n="2">Henrik cried ;</l>
     <l n="3">And , leaping o'er the green hedge , he stood by</l>
     <l n="4">Elsie 's side .</l>
     <l n="5">None saw the fond embracing , save , shining from</l>
     <l n="6">afar ,</l>
     <l n="7">The Golden Goose that watched them from the</l>
     <l n="8">tower of Valdemar .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>O darling girls of Denmark ! of all the flowers that throng Her vales of spring the fairest , I sing for you my song . No praise as yours so bravely rewards the singer 's skill ; Thank God ! of maids like Elsie the land has plenty still !</p>

    <head>THE DEAD FEAST OF THE KOL-FOLK .</head>
    <head>E. B. Tylor in his Primitive Culture , chapter xii ., gives an account of the reverence paid the dead by the Kol tribes of Chota Nagpur , Assam . “ When a Ho or Munda , ” he says , “ has been burned on the funeral pile , collected morsels of his bones are carried in procession with a solemn , ghostly , sliding step , keeping time to the deep-sounding drum , and when the old woman who carries the bones on her bamboo tray lowers it from time to time , then girls who carry pitchers and brass vessels mournfully reverse them to show that they are empty ; thus the remains are taken to visit every house in the village , and every dwelling of a friend or relative for miles , and the inmates come out to mourn and praise the goodness of the departed ; the bones are carried to all the dead man 's favorite haunts , to the fields he cultivated , to the grove he planted , to the threshing-floor where he worked , to the village dance-room where he made merry . At last they are taken to the grave , and buried in an earthen vase upon a store of food , covered with one of those huge stone slabs which European visitors wonder at in the districts of the aborigines of India . ” In the Journal of the Asiatic Society , Bengal , vol . ix ., p. 795 , is a Ho dirge .</head>

    <head>THE KING 'S MISSIVE .</head>
     <l n="1">1661 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>This ballad , originally written for The Memorial History of Boston , describes , with pardonable poetic license , a memorable incident in the annals of the city . The interview between Shattuck and the Governor took place , I have since learned , in the residence of the latter , and not in the Council Chamber . The publication of the ballad led to some discussion as to the historical truthfulness of the picture , but I have seen no reason to rub out any of the figures or alter the lines and colors .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">UNDER the great hill sloping bare</l>
     <l n="2">To cove and meadow and Common lot ,</l>
     <l n="3">In his council chamber and oaken chair ,</l>
     <l n="4">Sat the worshipful Governor Endicott .</l>
     <l n="5">A grave , strong man , who knew no peer</l>
     <l n="6">In the pilgrim land , where he ruled in fear</l>
     <l n="7">Of God , not man , and for good or ill</l>
     <l n="8">Held his trust with an iron will .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">He had shorn with his sword the cross from out</l>
     <l n="10">The flag , and cloven the May-pole down ,</l>
     <l n="11">Harried the heathen round about ,</l>
     <l n="12">And whipped the Quakers from town to town .</l>
     <l n="13">Earnest and honest , a man at need</l>
     <l n="14">To burn like a torch for his own harsh creed ,</l>
     <l n="15">He kept with the flaming brand of his zeal</l>
     <l n="16">The gate of the holy common weal .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="17">His brow was clouded , his eye was stern ,</l>

     <l n="20">The pestilent Quakers are in my path !</l>
     <l n="21">Some we have scourged , and banished some ,</l>
     <l n="22">Some hanged , more doomed , and still they come ,</l>

     <l n="28">Troublers of Israel such as these ?</l>
     <l n="29">Shall I spare ? Shall I pity them ? God forbid !</l>

     <l n="45">Bring hither the Quaker . ” Calm , sedate ,</l>
     <l n="46">With the look of a man at ease with fate ,</l>

     <l n="52">I bear his message and stand in his stead . ”</l>
     <l n="53">In the Governor 's hand a missive he laid</l>
     <l n="54">With the royal arms on its seal displayed ,</l>
     <l n="55">And the proud man spake as he gazed thereat ,</l>
     <l n="56">Uncovering , “ Give Mr. Shattuck his hat . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="57">He turned to the Quaker , bowing low ,—</l>

    <head>THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS .</head>
    <head>The volume in which “ The Bay of Seven Islands ” was published was dedicated to the late Edwin Percy Whipple , to whom more than to any other person I was indebted for public recognition as one worthy of a place in American literature , at a time when it required a great degree of courage to urge such a claim for a pro-scribed abolitionist . Although younger than I , he had gained the reputation of a brilliant essayist , and was regarded as the highest American authority in criticism . His wit and wisdom enlivened a small literary circle of young men including Thomas Starr King , the eloquent preacher , and Daniel N. Haskell of the Daily Transcript , who gathered about our common friend dames T. Fields at the Old Corner Bookstore . The poem which gave title to the volume I inscribed to my friend and neighbor Harriet Prescott Spofford , whose poems have lent a new interest to our beautiful river-valley .</head>

   <p>HOW THE WOMEN WENT FROM DOVER .</p>
   <p>The following is a copy of the warrant issued by Major Waldron , of Dover , in 1662 . The Quakers , as was their wont , prophesied against him , and saw , as they supposed , the fulfilment of their prophecy when , many years after , he was killed by the Indians .</p>
   <p>To the constables of Dover , Hampton , Salisbury , Newbury , Rowley , Ipswich , Wenham , Lynn , Boston , Roxbury , Dedham , and until these vagabond Quakers are carried out of this jurisdiction . You , and every one of you , are required , in the King 's Majesty 's name , to take these vagabond Quakers , Anne Colman , Mary Tomkins , and Alice Ambrose , and make them fast to the cart 's tail , and driving the cart through your several towns , to whip them upon their naked backs not exceeding ten stripes apiece on each of them , in each town ; and so to convey them from constable to constable till they are out of this jurisdiction , as you will answer it at your peril ; and this shall be your warrant . RICHARD WALDRON . Dated at Dover , December 22 , 1662 .</p>
   <p>This warrant was executed only in Dover and Hampton . At Salisbury the constable refused to obey it . He was sustained by the town 's people , who were under the influence of Major Robert Pike , the leading man in the lower valley of the Merrimac , who stood far in advance of his time , as an advocate of religious freedom , and an opponent of ecclesiastical authority . He had the moral courage to address an able and manly letter to the court at Salem , remonstrating against the witchcraft trials .</p>

     <l n="1">HAPPY young friends , sit by me ,</l>
     <l n="2">Under May 's blown apple-tree ,</l>
     <l n="3">While these home-birds in and out</l>

     <l n="5">Hear a story , strange and old ,</l>
     <l n="6">By the wild red Indians told ,</l>
     <l n="7">How the robin came to be :</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="8">Once a great chief left his son ,—</l>
     <l n="9">Well-beloved , his only one ,—</l>
     <l n="10">When the boy was well-nigh grown ,</l>
     <l n="11">In the trial-lodge alone .</l>
     <l n="12">Left for tortures long and slow</l>
     <l n="13">Youths like him must undergo ,</l>
     <l n="14">Who their pride of manhood test ,</l>
     <l n="15">Lacking water , food , and rest .</l>

     <l n="16">Seven days the fast he kept ,</l>
     <l n="17">Seven nights he never slept .</l>
     <l n="18">Then the young boy , wrung with pain ,</l>
     <l n="19">Weak from nature 's overstrain ,</l>
     <l n="20">Faltering , moaned a low complaint</l>
     <l n="21">“ Spare me , father , for I faint ! ”</l>
     <l n="22">But the chieftain , haughty-eyed ,</l>
     <l n="23">Hid his pity in his pride .</l>
     <l n="24">“ You shall be a hunter good ,</l>
     <l n="25">Knowing never lack of food ;</l>
     <l n="26">You shall be a warrior great ,</l>
     <l n="27">Wise as fox and strong as bear ;</l>
     <l n="28">Many scalps your belt shall wear ,</l>
     <l n="29">If with patient heart you wait</l>
     <l n="30">Bravely till your task is done .</l>
     <l n="31">Better you should starving die</l>
     <l n="32">Than that boy and squaw should cry</l>
     <l n="33">Shame upon your father 's son ! ”</l>

     <l n="34">When next morn the sun 's first rays</l>
     <l n="35">Glistened on the hemlock sprays ,</l>

     <l n="37">And boiled sainp and moose meat brought .</l>

     <l n="43">On the lodge-top overhead ,</l>
     <l n="44">Preening smooth its breast of red</l>
     <l n="45">And the brown coat that it wore ,</l>
     <l n="46">Sat a bird , unknown before .</l>
     <l n="47">And as if with human tongue ,</l>
     <l n="48">“ Mourn me not , ” it said , or sung ;</l>
     <l n="49">“ I , a bird , am still your son ,</l>
     <l n="50">Happier than if hunter fleet ,</l>

     <l n="52">Laying scalps in battle won .</l>
     <l n="53">Friend of man , my song shall cheer</l>
     <l n="54">Lodge and corn-land ; hovering near ,</l>
     <l n="55">To each wigwam I shall bring</l>
     <l n="56">Tidings of the corning spring ;</l>
     <l n="57">Every child my voice shall know</l>
     <l n="58">In the moon of melting snow ,</l>
     <l n="59">When the maple 's red bud swells ,</l>
     <l n="60">And the wind-flower lifts its bells .</l>
     <l n="61">As their fond companion</l>
     <l n="62">Men shall henceforth own your son ,</l>
     <l n="63">And my song shall testify</l>

     <l n="68">Bird for boy , and still the same .</l>
     <l n="69">If my young friends doubt that this</l>
     <l n="70">Is the robin 's genesis ,</l>
     <l n="71">Not in vain is still the myth</l>

    <head>BANISHED FROM MASSACHUSETTS .</head>

   <p>On a painting by E. A. Abbey . The General Court of Massachusetts enacted Oct. 19 , 1658 , that “ any person or persons of the cursed sect of Quakers ” should , on conviction of the same , be banished , on pain of death , from the jurisdiction of the common-wealth .</p>

     <l n="1">OVER the threshold of his pleasant home</l>
     <l n="2">Set in green clearings passed the exiled Friend ,</l>
     <l n="3">In simple trust , misdoubting not the end .</l>
     <l n="4">“ Dear heart of mine ! ” he said , “ the time has come</l>
     <l n="5">To trust the Lord for shelter . ” One long gaze</l>
     <l n="6">The goodwife turned on each familiar thing ,—</l>
     <l n="7">The lowing kine , the orchard blossoming ,</l>
     <l n="8">The open door that showed the hearth-fire 's blaze ,—</l>
     <l n="9">And calmly answered , “ Yes , He will provide . ”</l>
     <l n="10">Silent and slow they crossed the homestead 's bound ,</l>
     <l n="11">Lingering the longest by their child 's grave-mound .</l>
     <l n="12">“ Move on , or stay and hang ! ” the sheriff cried .</l>
     <l n="13">They left behind them more than home or land ,</l>
     <l n="14">And set sad faces to an alien strand .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="15">Safer with winds and waves than human wrath ,</l>
     <l n="16">With ravening wolves than those whose zeal for God</l>

     <l n="18">Drear leagues of forest without guide or path ,</l>
     <l n="19">Or launching frail boats on the uncharted sea ,</l>
     <l n="20">Round storm-vexed capes , whose teeth of granite ground</l>

     <l n="25">For you the Mayflower spread her sail once more ,</l>
     <l n="26">Freighted with souls , to all that duty bid</l>
     <l n="27">Faithful as they who sought an unknown land ,</l>

     <l n="29">So from his lost home to the darkening main ,</l>

     <l n="36">So the gray Southwicks , from a rainy sea ,</l>
     <l n="37">Saw , far and faint , the loom of land , and gave</l>
     <l n="38">With feeble voices thanks for friendly ground</l>
     <l n="39">Whereon to rest their weary feet , and found</l>

     <l n="43">Aquidneck 's isle , Nantucket 's lonely shores ,</l>

     <l n="46">Or heard the plashing of their weary oars .</l>

     <l n="48">Happier for pure and gracious womanhood ,</l>
     <l n="49">And men whose names for stainless honor stood ,</l>
     <l n="50">Founders of States and rulers wise and true .</l>
     <l n="51">The Muse of history yet shall make amends</l>
     <l n="52">To those who freedom , peace , and justice taught ,</l>
     <l n="53">Beyond their dark age led the van of thought ,</l>
     <l n="54">And left unforfeited the name of Friends .</l>
     <l n="55">O mother State , how foiled was thy design</l>
     <l n="56">The gain was theirs , the loss alone was thine .</l>

   <p>THE BROWN DWARF OF RUGEN .</p>
   <p>The hint of this ballad is found in Arndt 's Murchen , Berlin , 1816 . The ballad appeared first in St. Nicholas , whose young readers were advised , while smiling at the absurd superstition , to remember that bad companionship and evil habits , desires , and passions are more to be dreaded now than the Elves and Trolls who frightened the children of past ages .</p>
   <p>THE pleasant isle of Rugen looks the Baltic water o'er , To the silver-sanded beaches of the Pomeranian shore ;</p>
   <p>And in the town of Rambin a little boy and maid Plucked the meadow-flowers together and in the sea-surf played .</p>
   <p>Alike were they in beauty if not in their degree He was the Amptman 's first-born , the miller 's child was she .</p>
   <p>Now of old the isle of Rugen was full of Dwarfs and Trolls , The brown-faced little Earth-men , the people without souls ;</p>
   <p>And for every man and woman in Rugen 's island found Walking in air and sunshine , a Troll was underground .</p>
   <p>It chanced the little maiden , one morning , strolled away Among the haunted Nine Hills , where the elves and goblins play .</p>
   <p>That day , in barley-fields below , the harvesters had known Of evil voices in the air , and heard the small horns blown .</p>
   <p>She came not back ; the search for her in field and wood was vain They cried her east , they cried her west , but she came not again .</p>
   <p>“ She 's down among the Brown Dwarfs , ” said the dream-wives wise and old , And prayers were made , and masses said , and Rambin 's church bell tolled .</p>
   <p>Five years her father mourned her ; and then John Deitrich said “ I will find my little playmate , be she alive or dead . ”</p>
   <p>He watched among the Nine Hills , he heard the Brown Dwarfs sing , And saw them dance by moonlight merrily in a ring .</p>
   <p>And when their gay-robed leader tossed up his cap of red , Young Deitrich caught it as it fell , and thrust it on his head .</p>
   <p>The Troll came crouching at his feet and wept for lack of it . “ Oh , give me back my magic cap , for your great head unfit ! ”</p>
   <p>“ Nay , ” Deitrich said ; “ the Dwarf who throws his charmed cap away , Must serve its finder at his will , and for his folly pay .</p>
   <p>“ You stole my pretty Lisbeth , and hid her in the earth ; And you shall ope the door of glass and let me lead her forth . ”</p>
   <p>“ She will not come ; she 's one of us ; she 's mine ! ” the Brown Dwarf said ; The day is set , the cake is baked , to-morrow we shall wed . ”</p>
   <p>“ The fell fiend fetch thee ! ” Deitrich cried , “ and keep thy foul tongue still . Quick ! open , to thy evil world , the glass door of the hill ! ”</p>
   <p>The Dwarf obeyed ; and youth and Troll down , the long stair-way passed , And saw in dim and sunless light a country strange and vast .</p>
   <p>Weird , rich , and wonderful , he saw the elfin under-land ,— Its palaces of precious stones , its streets of golden sand .</p>
   <p>He came unto a banquet-hall with tables richly spread , Where a young maiden served to him the red wine and the bread .</p>
   <p>How fair she seemed among the Trolls so ugly and so wild ! Yet pale and very sorrowful , like one who never smiled !</p>
   <p>Her low , sweet voice , her gold-brown hair , her tender blue eyes seemed Like something he had seen elsewhere or some . thing he had dreamed .</p>
   <p>He looked ; he clasped her in his arms ; he knew the long-lost one ; “ O Lisbeth ! See thy playmate — I am the Amptman 's son ! ”</p>
   <p>She leaned her fair head on his breast , and through her sobs she spoke “ Oh , take me from this evil place , and from the elfin folk ,</p>
   <p>“ And let me tread the grass-green fields and smell the flowers again , And feel the soft wind on my cheek and hear the dropping rain !</p>
   <p>“ And oh , to hear the singing bird , the rustling of the tree , The lowing cows , the bleat of sheep , the voices of the sea ;</p>
   <p>“ And oh , upon my father 's knee to sit beside the door , And hear the bell of vespers ring in Rambin church once more ! ”</p>
   <p>He kissed her cheek , he kissed her lips ; the Brown Dwarf groaned to see , And tore his tangled hair and ground his long teeth angrily .</p>
   <p>But Deitrich said : “ For five long years this tender Christian maid Has served you in your evil world and well must she be paid !</p>
   <p>“ Haste !— hither bring me precious gems , the richest in your store ; Then when we pass the gate of glass , you 'll take your cap once more . ”</p>
   <p>No choice was left the baffled Troll , and , murmuring , he obeyed , And filled the pockets of the youth and apron of the maid .</p>
   <p>They left the dreadful under-land and passed the gate of glass ; They felt the sunshine 's warm caress , they trod the soft , green grass .</p>
   <p>And when , beneath , they saw the Dwarf stretch up to them his brown And crooked claw-like fingers , they tossed his red cap down .</p>
   <p>Oh , never shone so bright a sun , was never sky so blue , As hand in hand they homeward walked the pleasant meadows through !</p>
   <p>And never sang the birds so sweet in Rambin 's woods before , And never washed the waves so soft along the Baltic shore ;</p>
   <p>And when beneath his door-yard trees the father met his child , The bells rung out their merriest peal , the folks with joy ran wild .</p>
