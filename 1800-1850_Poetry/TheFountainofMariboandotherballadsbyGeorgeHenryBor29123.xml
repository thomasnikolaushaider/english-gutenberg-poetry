     <l n="4">The Queen then a present made him .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="37">Ramund drew out his trusty glaive ,</l>

     <l n="48">“ Dost wish for a fight ?” said Ramund the young .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="49">“ Dear Ramund , if thou wilt let me live ,</l>

     <l n="51">I ’ ll bathe thee in wine , and to thee I will give</l>
     <l n="52">Seven bushels of gold from my coffer .”</l>
     <l n="53">“ Make ’ em eight , if you will ,” bold Ramund he said ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="55">The first , first day that together they fought</l>
     <l n="56">With their naked fists they contested ;</l>
     <l n="57">Then Ramund he hold of the Jutt ’ s beard caught</l>
     <l n="58">And the flesh from the teeth he wrested .</l>
     <l n="59">“ Thou grinnest full evil , bold Ramund ,” he said ,</l>
     <l n="60">“ Thou look ’ st worse than the Devil ,” said Ramund the young .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="61">Next day they set to at the rise of the sun ,</l>
     <l n="62">Again with a rage unexampled ;</l>
     <l n="63">The huge stone mountain they stood upon</l>
     <l n="64">To the earth ’ neath their feet was trampled .</l>
     <l n="65">“’ Tis hard sport , I swear !” the giant he said ,</l>
     <l n="66">“ We began but this year ,” said Ramund the young .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="67">Then Ramund again to his sword recurred ,</l>
     <l n="68">To which Dymling for name he had given ;</l>
     <l n="69">And the head of the Jutt , which no ox could have stirred ,</l>
     <l n="70">He hewed high unto the heaven .</l>
     <l n="71">“’ Twould not cut well I thought ,” bold Ramund he said</l>
     <l n="72">“ Yet it cut as it ought ,” said Ramund the young .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="73">Ramund he into the mountain strode ,</l>
     <l n="74">Where the small trolds house were keeping ;</l>
     <l n="75">The tears fast down their visages flow ’ d ,</l>
     <l n="76">For Ramund they fell to weeping .</l>
     <l n="77">“ Do ye weep for me ,” bold Ramund he said ,</l>
     <l n="78">“ I ’ ll ne ’ er weep for ye ,” said Ramund the young .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="79">Now Ramund behold is dealing his blows</l>
     <l n="80">Like the Kemps most famed for fighting ;</l>
     <l n="81">About and around in the cave he goes</l>
     <l n="82">To the earth the demons smiting .</l>
     <l n="83">“ I rule here at my ease ,” bold Ramund he said ,</l>
     <l n="84">“ And can do what I please ,” said Ramund the young .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="85">On his ship entered he so vehemently</l>
     <l n="86">That it cracked his vehemence under ;</l>
     <l n="87">In the ship the men all began loudly to bawl</l>
     <l n="88">And thought they should certainly founder .</l>
     <l n="89">“ We shall not sink here ,” bold Ramund he said ,</l>
     <l n="90">“ So ye need not to fear ,” said Ramund the young .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="91">Now Ramund he straight seven ships did freight</l>
     <l n="92">With the gold which the Trolds had hoarded ;</l>
     <l n="93">Then across the tide to the land he hied</l>
     <l n="94">O ’ er which the Emperor lorded .</l>
     <l n="95">“ To this land we are come ,” bold Ramund he said ,</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="97">On the white sand Ramund his anchor flung ,</l>
     <l n="98">The high prow strandward turning ;</l>
     <l n="99">And the very first man to land that sprung</l>
     <l n="100">Was himself , with eagerness burning .</l>
     <l n="101">“ Now do nothing more ,” bold Ramund he said ,</l>
     <l n="102">“ All labour give o ’ er ,” said Ramund the young .</l>

     <l n="103">To the Ball-house he sped , where the kempions play ’ d</l>
     <l n="104">At ball with glee and vigour ;</l>
     <l n="105">But at his coming all stood adread ,</l>
     <l n="106">At the sight of so fierce a figure .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="19">
     <l n="109">With fear and dismay upon his brow</l>

     <l n="118">On the bough that were singing assembled .</l>
     <l n="119">“ Come down to me , knave ,” bold Ramund he said ,</l>

     <l n="127">On the door Ramund smote with an iron bar stout ,</l>
