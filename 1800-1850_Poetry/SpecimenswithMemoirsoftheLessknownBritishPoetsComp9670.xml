    <docTitle><titlePart>SPECIMENS WITH MEMOIRS OF THE LESS-KNOWN BRITISH POETS . With an Introductory Essay , BY THE REV . GEORGE GILFILLAN . COMPLETE VOL . I. M. DCCC. LX . INTRODUCTORY ESSAY We propose to introduce our ‘ Specimens ’ by a short Essay on the Origin and Progress of English Poetry on to the days of Chaucer and of Gower . Having called , in conjunction with many other critics , Chaucer ‘ the Father of English Poetry , ’ to seek to go back further may seem like pursuing antenatal researches . But while Chaucer was the sun , a certain glimmering dawn had gone before him , and to reflect that , is the object of the following pages . Britain , when the Romans invaded it , was a barbarous country ; and although subjugated and long held by that people , they seem to have left it nearly as uncultivated and illiterate as they found it . ‘ No magnificent remains , ’ says Macaulay , ‘ of Latian porches and aqueducts are to be found in Britain . No writer of British birth is to be reckoned among the masters of Latin poetry and eloquence . It is not probable that the islanders were , at any time , generally familiar with the tongue of their Italian rulers . From the Atlantic to the vicinity of the Rhine the Latin has , during many centuries , been predominant . It drove out the Celtic — it was not driven out by the Teutonic — and it is at this day the basis of the French , Spanish , and Portuguese languages . In our island the Latin appears never to have superseded the old Gaelic speech , and could not stand its ground before the German . ’ It was in the fifth century that that modification of the German or Teutonic speech called the Anglo-Saxon was introduced into this country . It soon asserted its superiority over the British tongue , which seemed to retreat before it , reluctantly and proudly , like a lion , into the mountain-fastnesses of Wales or to the rocky sea-beach of Cornwall . The triumph was not completed all at once , but from the beginning it was secure . The bards of Wales continued to sing , but their strains resembled the mutterings of thunder among their own hills , only half heard in the distant valleys , and exciting neither curiosity nor awe . For five centuries , with the exception of some Latin words added by the preachers of Christianity , the Anglo-Saxon language continued much as it was when first introduced . Barbarous as the manners of the people were , literature was by no means left without a witness . Its chief cultivators were the monks and other religious persons , who spent their leisure in multiplying books , either by original composition or by transcription , including treatises on theology , historical chronicles , and a great abundance and variety of poetical productions . These were written at first exclusively in Latin , but occasionally , in process of time , in the Anglo - Saxon tongue . The theology taught in them was , no doubt , crude and corrupted , the history was stuffed with fables , and the poetry was rough and bald in the extreme ; but still they furnished a food fitted for the awakening mind of the age . When the Christian religion reached Great Britain , it brought necessarily with it an impulse to intellect as well as to morality . So startling are the facts it relates , so broad and deep the principles it lays down , so humane the spirit it inculcates , and so ravishing the hopes it awakens , that , however disguised in superstition and clouded by imperfect representation , it never fails to produce , in all countries to which it comes , a resurrection of the nation 's virtue , and a revival , for a time at least , of the nation 's political and intellectual energy and genius . Hence we find the very earliest literary names in our early annals are those of Christian missionaries . Such is said to have been Gildas , a Briton , who lived in the first part of the sixth century , and is the reputed author of a short history of Britain in Latin . Such was the still more apocryphal Nennius , also called , till of late , the writer of a small Latin historical work . Such was St Columbanus , who was born in Ireland in 560 ; became a monk in the Irish monastery of Benchor ; and afterwards , at the head of twelve disciples , preached Christianity , in its most ascetic form , in England and in France ; founded in the latter country various monasteries ; and , when banished by Queen Brunehaut on account of his stern inflexibility of character , went to Switzerland , and then to Lombardy , proselytising the heathen , and defending , by his letters and other writings , the peculiar tenets of the Irish Church in reference to the time of the celebration of Easter and to the popular heresies of the day . He died October 2 , 615 , in the monastery of Bobbio ; and his religious treatises and Latin poetry gave an undoubted impulse to the age 's progress in letters . About this period the better sort of Saxons , both clergy and laity , got into the habit of visiting Rome ; while Rome , in her turn , sent emissaries to England . Thus , while the one insensibly imbibed new knowledge as well as devotion from the great centre , the other brought with them to our shores importations of books , including copies of such religious classics as Josephus and Chrysostom , and of such literary classics as Homer . About 680 , died Caedmon , a monk of Whitby , one of the first who composed in Anglo-Saxon , and some of whose compositions are preserved . Strange and myth-like stories are told by Bede about this remarkable natural genius . He was originally a cow-herd . Partly from want of training , and partly from bashfulness , when the harp was given him in the hall , and he was asked , as all others were , to raise the voice of song , Caedmon had often to abscond in confusion . On one occasion he had retired to the stable , where he fell into a sound sleep . He dreamed that a stranger appeared to him , and said , ‘ Caedmon , sing me something . ’ Caedmon replied that it was his incapacity to sing which had brought him to take refuge in the stable . ‘ Nay , ’ said the stranger , ‘ but thou hast something to sing . ’ ‘ What shall I sing ? ’ rejoined Caedmon . ‘ Sing the Creation , ’ and thereupon he began to pour out verses , which , when he awoke , he remembered , repeated , and to which he added others as good . The first lines are , as translated into English , the following :— Now let us praise The Guardian of heaven , The might of the Creator And his counsel — The Glory !— Father of men ! He first created , For the children of men , Heaven as a roof — The holy Creator ! Then the world — The Guardian of mankind ! The Eternal Lord ! Produced afterwards The Earth for men — The Almighty Master ! ’ Our readers all remember the well-known story of Coleridge falling asleep over Purchas 's ‘ Pilgrims ’ ; how the poem of ‘ Kubla Khan ’ came rushing from dreamland upon his soul ; and how , when awakened , he wrote it down , and found it to be , if not sense , something better — a glorious piece of fantastic imagination . We knew a gentleman who , slumbering while in a state of bad health , produced , in the course of a few hours , one or two thousand rhymed lines , some of which he repeated in our hearing afterwards , and which were full of point and poetry . We cannot see that Caedmon 's lines betray any weird inspiration ; but when rehearsed the next day to the Abbess Hilda , to whom the town-bailiff of Whitby conducted him , she and a circle of learned men pronounced that he had received the gift of song direct from heaven ! They , after one or two other trials of his powers , persuaded him to become a monk in the house of the Abbess , who commanded him to transfer to verse the whole of the Scripture history . It is said that he was constantly employed in repeating to himself what he had heard ; or , as one of his old biographers has it , ‘ like a clean animal ruminating it , he turned it into most sweet verse . ’ In this way he wrote or rather improvised a vast quantity of poetry , chiefly on religious subjects . Thorpe , in his edition of this author , has preserved a speech of Satan , bearing a striking resemblance to some parts of Milton :— ‘ Boiled within him His thought about his heart , Hot was without him , His due punishment . “ This narrow place is most unlike That other that we formerly knew High in heaven 's kingdom , Which my master bestowed on me , Though we it , for the All-Powerful , May not possess . That is to me of sorrows the greatest , That Adam , Who was wrought of earth , Shall possess My strong seat ; That it shall be to him in delight , And we endure this torment , Misery in this hell . Here is a vast fire , Above and underneath . Never did I see A loathlier landscape . The flame abateth not Hot over hell . Me hath the clasping of these rings , This hard-polished band , Impeded in my course , Debarred me from my way . My feet are bound , My hands manacled ; Of these hell-doors are The ways obstructed , So that with aught I cannot From these limb-bonds escape . About me lie Huge gratings Of hard iron , Forged with heat , With which me God Hath fastened by the neck . Thus perceive I that he knoweth my mind , And that he knew also , The Lord of hosts , That should us through Adam Evil befall , About the realm of heaven , Where I had power of my hands . " ’ Through these rude lines there flashes forth , like fire through a thick dull grating , a powerful conception — one which Milton has borrowed and developed — that of the Evil One feeling in his dark bosom jealousy at young Man , almost overpowering his hatred to God ; and another conception still more striking , that of the devil 's thorough conviction that all his plans and thoughts are entirely known by his great Adversary , and are counteracted before they are formed — ‘ Thus perceive I that he knoweth my mind . ’ Compare this with Milton 's lines —</titlePart></docTitle>

     <p>‘ So should I purchase dear Short intermission , bought with double smart . This knows my Punisher ; therefore as far From granting he , as I from begging peace . ’ Caedmon saw , without being able fully to express , the complex idea of Satan , as distracted between a thousand thoughts , all miserable — tossed between a thousand winds , all hot as hell — ‘ pale ire , envy , and despair ’ struggling within him — fury at man overlapping anger at God — remorse and reckless desperation wringing each other 's miserable hands — a sense of guilt which will not confess , a fear that will not quake , a sorrow that will not weep , a respect for God which will not worship ; and yet , springing out of all these elements , a strange , proud joy , as though the torrid soil of Pandemonium should flower , which makes ‘ the hell he suffers seem a heaven , ’ compared to what his destiny might be were he either plunged into a deeper abyss , or taken up unchanged to his former abode of glory . This , in part at least , the monk of Whitby discerned ; but it was reserved for Milton to embody it in that tremendous figure which has since continued to dwindle all the efforts of art , and to haunt , like a reality , the human imagination . Passing over some interesting but subordinate Saxon writers , such as Ceolfrid , Abbot of Wearmouth ; Aldhelm , Abbot of Malmesbury ; Felix of Croyland ; and Alcuine , King Egbert 's librarian at York , we come to one who himself formed an era in the history of our early literature — the venerable Bede . This famous man was educated in the monastery of Wearmouth , and there appears to have spent the whole of his quiet , innocent , and studious life . He was the very sublimation of a book-worm . One might fancy him becoming at last , as in the ‘ Metamorphoses ’ of Ovid , one of the books , or rolls of vellum and parchment over which he con - stantly pored . That he did not marry , or was given in marriage , we are certain ; but there is little evidence that he even ate or drank , walked or slept . To read and to write seemed the ‘ be all and the end all ’ of his existence . Important as well as numerous were his contributions to literature . He translated from the Scriptures . He wrote religious treatises , biographies , and commentaries upon portions of Holy Writ . Besides his very valuable Ecclesiastical History , he composed various pieces of Latin poetry . His works in all were forty-four in number : and it is said that on the very day of his death ( it took place in 735 ) he was dictating to his amanuensis , and had just completed a book . His works are wonderful for his time , and not the less interesting for a fine cobweb of fable which is woven over parts of them , and which seems in keeping with their venerable character . Thus , in speaking of the Magi who visited the infant Redeemer , he is very particular in describing their age , appearance , and offerings . Melchior , the first , was old , had gray hair , and a long beard ; and offered ‘ gold ’ to Christ , in , acknowledgment of His sovereignty . Gaspar , the second , was young , and had no beard ; and he offered ‘ frankincense , ’ in recognition of our Lord 's divinity . Balthasar , the third , was of a dark complexion , had a large beard , and offered ‘ myrrh ’ to our Saviour 's humanity . We should , we confess , miss such pleasant little myths in other old books besides Bede 's Histories . They seem appropriate to ancient works , as the beard is to the goat or the hermit ; and the truth that lies in them is not difficult to eliminate . The next name of note in our literary annals is that of the great Alfred . Surely if ever man was not only before his age , but before ‘ all ages , ’ it was he . A palm of the tropics growing on a naked Highland mountain-side , or an English oak bending over one of the hot springs of Hecla , were not a stranger or more preternatural sight than a man like Alfred appearing in a century like the ninth . A thousand theories about men being the creatures of their age , the products of circumstances , &amp; c ., sink into abeyance beside the facts of his life ; and we are driven to the good old belief that to some men the ‘ inspiration of the Almighty giveth understanding ; ’ and that their wisdom , their genius , and their excellency do not proceed from them-selves . On his deeds of valour and patriotism it is not necessary to dwell . These form the popular and bepraised side of his character , but they give a very inadequate idea of the whole . On one occasion he visited the Danish camp — a king disguised as a harper ; but he was , all his life long , a harper disguised as a king . He was at once a warrior , a legislator , an architect , a shipbuilder , a philosopher , a scholar , and a poet . His great object , as avowed in his last will , was to leave his people ‘ free as their own thoughts . ’ Hence he bent the whole force of his mind , first , to defend them from foreign foes , by encouraging the new naval strength he had himself established ; and then to cultivate their intellects , and make them , as well as their country , worth defending . Let us quote the glowing words of Burke :— ‘ He was indefatigable in his endeavours to bring into England men of learning in all branches from every part of Europe , and unbounded in his liberality to them . He enacted by a law that every person possessed of two hides of land should send their children to school until sixteen . He enterprised even a greater design than that of forming the growing generation — to instruct even the grown , enjoining all his sheriffs and other officers immediately to apply themselves to learning , or to quit their offices . Whatever trouble he took to extend the benefits of learning among his subjects , he shewed the example himself , and applied to the cultivation of his mind with unparalleled diligence and success . He could neither read nor write at twelve years old , but he improved his time in such a manner , that he became one of the most knowing men of his age , in geometry , in philosophy , in architecture , and in music . He applied himself to the improvement of his native language ; he translated several valuable works from Latin , and wrote a vast number of poems in the Saxon tongue with a wonderful facility and happiness . He not only excelled in the theory of the arts and sciences , but possessed a great mechanical genius for the executive part . He improved the manner of shipbuilding , introduced a more beautiful and commodious architecture , and even taught his countrymen the art of making bricks ; most of the buildings having been of wood before his time — in a word , he comprehended in the greatness of his mind the whole of government , and all its parts at once ; and what is most difficult to human frailty was at the same time sublime and minute . ’ Some exaggeration must be allowed for in all this account of Alfred the Great . But the fact that he left a stamp in his age so deep ,— that nothing except what was good and great has been ascribed to him ,— that the very fictions told of him are of such vraisemblance and magnitude as to FIT IN to nothing less than an extraordinary man ,— and that , as Burke says , ‘ whatever dark spots of human frailty may have adhered to such a character , are entirely hid in the splendour of many shining qualities and grand virtues , that throw a glory over the obscure period in which he lived , and which is for no other reason worthy of our knowledge , ’ — all proclaim his supremacy . Like many great men ,— like Julius Caesar , with his epilepsy — or Sir Walter Scott and Byron , with their lameness — or Schleiermacher , with his deformed appearance ,— a physical infirmity beset Alfred most of his life , and at last carried him off at a comparatively early age . This was a disease in his bowels , which had long afflicted him , ‘ without interrupting his designs , or souring his temper . ’ Nay , who can say that the constant presence of such a memento of weakness and mortality did not operate as a strong , quiet stimulus to do with his might what his hand found to do — to lower pride , and to prompt to labour ? If Saladin had had for his companion some such faithful hound of sorrow , it would have saved him the ostentatious flag stretched over his head , in the hour of wassail , with the inscription , ‘ Saladin , Saladin , king of kings ! Saladin must die ! ’ Alfred wrote little that was original , but he was a copious translator . He rendered into the Anglo-Saxon tongue — which he sought to enrich with the fatness of other soils — the historical works of Orosius and of Bede ; nay , it is said the Fables of Aesop , and the Psalms of David — desirous , it would seem , to teach his people morality and religion , through the fine medium , of fiction and poetry . Alfric , Archbishop of Canterbury , is the name of another important contributor to Saxon literature . He wrote a grammar of his native language , which procured him the name of the ‘ Grammarian , ’ besides a collection of homilies , some theological treatises , and a translation of the first seven books of the Old Testament . In imitation of Alfred , he devoted all his energies to the instruction of the common people , constantly writing in Anglo-Saxon , and avoiding as much as possible the use of compound or obscure words . After him appeared Cynewulf , Bishop of Winchester , Wulfstan , Archbishop of York , and others of some note . There was also slowly piled up in the course of ages , and by a succession of authors , that remarkable production , ‘ The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle . ’ This is thought to have commenced soon after the reign of Alfred , and continued till the times of Henry II . Previous , however , to the Norman invasion , there had been a decided falling off in the learning of the Saxons . This arose from various causes . Incessant wars tended to conserve and increase the barbarism of the people . Various libraries of value were destroyed by the incursions of the Danes . And not a few bishops , and other ecclesiastical dignitaries , began to consider learning as prejudicial to piety-and grammar and ungodliness were thought akin . The effect of this upon the subordinate clergy was most pernicious . In the tenth century , Oswald , Archbishop of Canterbury , found the monks of his province so grossly ignorant , not only of letters , but even of the canonical rules of their respective orders , that he required to send to France for competent masters to give them instruction . At length came the Conqueror , William , and one battle gave England to the Normans , which had cost the Romans , the Saxons , and the Danes so much time and blood to acquire . The people were not only conquered , but cowed and crushed . England was as easily and effectually subdued as was Ireland , sometime after , by Henry II . But while the Conquest was for a season fatal to liberty , it was from the first favourable to every species of literature , art , and poetry . ‘ The influence , ’ says Campbell , ‘ of the Norman Conquest upon the language of England was like that of a great inundation , which at first buries the face of the landscape under its waters , but which , at last subsiding , leaves behind it the elements of new beauty and fertility . Its first effect was to degrade the Anglo - Saxon tongue to the exclusive use of the inferior orders , and by the transference of estates ecclesiastical benefices , and civil dignities to Norman possessors , to give the French language , which had begun to prevail at court from the time of Edward the Confessor , a more complete predominance among the higher classes of society . The native gentry of England were either driven into exile , or depressed into a state of dependence on their conqueror , which habituated them to speak his language . On the other hand , we received from the Normans the first germs of romantic poetry ; and our language was ultimately indebted to them for a wealth and compass of expression which it probably would not have otherwise possessed . ’</p>

    <docImprint>The Anglo-Saxon , however , held its place long among the lower orders , and specimens of it , both in prose and verse , are found a century after the Conquest . Gradually the Norman tongue began to amalgamate with it , and the result was , the English . At what precise year our language might be said to begin , it is impossible to determine . Throughout the whole of the twelfth century , great changes were taking place in the grammatical construction , as well as in the substance of the Anglo-Saxon . Some new words were imported from the Norman , but , as Dr Johnson remarks , ‘ the language was still more materially altered by the change of its sounds , the cutting short of its syllables , and the softening down of its terminations , and inflections of words . ’ Somewhere between<date>1180</date>and<date>1216</date>, the majestic speech in which Shakspeare was to write ‘ Macbeth ’ and ‘ King Lear , ’ Lord Bacon his ‘ Advancement of Learning , ’ Milton his ‘ Paradise Lost ’ and ‘ Areopagitica , ’ Burke his ‘ Reflections , ’ and Sir Walter Scott the Waverley Novels , and whose rough , but manly accents were to be spoken by at least a hundred million tongues , commenced its career , and not since Homer ,</docImprint>

    <docImprint>had a nobler era been marked in the history of literature . For here was a tongue born which was destined to mate even with that of Greece in richness and flexibility , to make the language of Cicero and Virgil seem stiff and stilted in comparison , and , if not to vie with the French in airy grace , or with the Italian in liquid music , to excel them far in teeming resources and robust energy . Memorable and hallowed for ever be the hour when the ‘ well of English undefiled ’ first sparkled to the day ! Previous to this the chief of the poets , after the Conquest , were Normans . The country whence that people came had for some time been celebrated for poetry .<country>France</country>was , as to its poetic literature , divided into two great sections — the Provençal and the Northern . The first was like the country where it flourished — gay , flowery , and exuberant ; it swam in romance , and its rhymers delighted , when addressing large audiences under the open skies of their delightful climate , to indulge in compliment and fanfaronade , to sing of war , wine , and love . The Normans produced a race of simpler poets . That some of them were men as well as singers , is proved by the fact that it was a bard named Taillefer who first broke the English ranks at the battle of Hastings . After him came Philippe de Thaun , who tried to set to song the science of his day ; Thorold , the author of a romance entitled ‘ Roland ; ’ Samson de Nauteuil , the translator of Solomon 's Proverbs into French verse ; Geoffrey Gaimar , who wrote a Chronicle of the Saxon kings ; and one David , a minstrel of no little note and power in his day . But a more remarkable writer succeeded , and his work , like Aaron 's rod , swallowed up all the productions of these clever but petty poets . This was Wace , commonly called Maistre Wace , a native of Jersey . In<date>1160</date>, or as some say<date>1155</date>, Wace finished his ‘ Brut d'Angleterre ’ which is in reality a translation into French of Geoffrey of Monmouth , who wrote a History of Britain from the imaginary Brutus of Troy down to Cadwallader in 689 . Literature owes not a little to Wace 's poem . He collected into a permanent shape a number of traditions and legends — many of them interesting — which had been floating through Europe , just as Macpherson preserved in Ossian not a few real fragments of the songs of Selma . And , as we shall see immediately , Wace 's production became the basis of the earliest of English poems . Maistre Wace is the author also of a History of the Normans , which he calls ‘ Roman de Rou ; ’ or , ‘ The Romance of Rollo . ’ He was a great favourite with Henry II ., who bestowed on him a canonry in the Cathedral of Bayeux . Besides Wace , there flourished about the same time Benoit , who wrote a History of the Dukes of Normandy ; and Guernes , a churchman of Pont St Maxence in Picardy , who wrote in verse a Life of St Thomas à Becket . At the beginning of the century following the Conquest , the chief authors , such as Peter of Blois , John of Salisbury , Joseph of Exeter , and Geoffrey of Monmouth , all wrote in Latin . Layamon , however , a priest of Ernesley - upon-Severn , used the vernacular in a poem which , as we have already hinted , was essentially a translation of Wace 's ‘ Brut d'Angleterre . ’ The most remarkable thing about Layamon 's poem is the language in which it is written-language in which you catch English in the very act of chipping the Saxon shell , or , as Campbell happily remarks , ‘ the style of Layamon is as nearly the intermediate state of the old and new languages as can be found in any ancient specimen — something like the new insect stirring its wings before it has shaken off the aurelia state . ’ Between Layamon and Robert of Gloucester a good many miscellaneous strains — some of a satirical , others of an amatory , and others again of a legendary and devout style — were produced . It was customary then for minstrels , at the instance of the clergy , to sing on Sundays devotional strains on the harp to the assembled multitudes . At public entertainments , during week-days , gay ditties were common . One of these is extant , but is too coarse for quotation . It is entitled ‘ The Land of Cokayne , ’ an allegorical satire on the luxury and vice of the Church , given under the description of an imaginary paradise , in which the nuns are represented as houris , and the black and grey monks as their paramours . ‘ Richard of Alemaine ’ is a ballad , composed by an adherent of Simon de Montfort , Earl of Leicester , after the defeat of the Royal party at the battle of Lewes in<date>1264</date>. In the year after that battle the Royal cause rallied , and the Earl of Warren and Sir Hugh Bigod returned from exile , and helped the King in his victory . In the battle of Lewes , Richard , King of the Romans , his brother Henry III ., and Prince Edward , with many others of the Royal party , were taken prisoners . [ Note : See ‘ Richard of Alemaine , ’ Percy 's Reliques , vol . ii ., p . 2 . ] The spirit and the allusions of this song shew that it was composed by Leicester 's party in the moment of their victory , and not after the reaction which took place against their cause , and it must therefore belong to the thirteenth century . To this period , too , probably belongs a political satire , published by Ritson , and which Campbell thus charac - terises :— ‘ It is a ballad on the execution of the Scottish patriots , Sir William Wallace and Sir Simon Frazer . The diction is as barbarous as we should expect from a song of triumph on such a subject . It relates the death and treatment of Wallace very minutely . The circumstance of his being covered with a mock crown of laurel in Westminster Hall , which Stow repeats , is there mentioned , and that of his legs being fastened with iron fetters “ under his horse 's wombe ” is told with savage exultation . The piece was probably indited in the very year of the political murders which it celebrates , certainly before<date>1314</date>, as it mentions the skulking of Robert Bruce , which , after the battle of Bannockburn , must have become a jest out of season . ’ Campbell quotes a love-ditty of this period , which is not devoid of merit :— ‘ For her love I cark and cave , For her love I droop and dare , For her love my bliss is bare , And all I wax wan . ‘ For her love in sleep I slake ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>For her love all night I wake , For her love mourning I make More than any man . ’<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>‘ In sleep I slake : ’ am deprived of sleep . And another of a pastoral vein :— ‘ When the nightingale singës the woods waxen green , Leaf , grass , and blossom springs in Avril I ween , And love is to my heart gone , with one spear so keen , Night and day my blood it drinks , my heart doth me teen . ’ About a hundred years after Layamon ( in<date>1280</date>) appeared a poet not dissimilar to him , named Robert of Gloucester . His surname is unknown , and so are the particulars of his history . We know only that he was a monk of Gloucester Abbey , that he lived in the reigns of Henry III . and Edward I ., and that he translated the Legends of Geoffrey of Monmouth , and continued the History of<country>England</country>down to the time of Edward I . This work is wonder - fully minute , and , generally speaking , accurate in its topography as well as narrative , and was of service to Selden when he wrote his Notes to Drayton 's ‘ Polyolbion . ’ It is more valuable in this respect than as a piece of imagination . He narrates the grandest events — such as the first crusaders bursting into Asia , with a sword of fire hung in the firmament before them , and beckoning them on their way — as coolly as he might the emigration of a colony of ants . Yet , although there is little animation or poetry in his general manner , he usually succeeds in riveting the reader 's attention ; and the speeches he puts into the mouths of his heroes glow with at least rhetorical fire . And as a critic truly remarks — ‘ Injustice to the ancient versifier , we should remember that he had still only a rude language to employ , the speech of boors and burghers , which , though it might possess a few songs and satires , could afford him no models of heroic narration . In such an age the first occupant passes uninspired over subjects which might kindle the highest enthusiasm in the poet of a riper period , as the savage treads unconsciously in his deserts over mines of incalculable value , without sagacity to discover or inplements to explore them . ’ We give the following extracts from Robert of Gloucester 's poem :— THE SPOUTS AND SOLEMNITIES WHICH FOLLOWED KING ARTHUR 'S CORONATION . The king was to his palace , tho the service was ydo ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>Yled with his meinie ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>and the queen to her also . For they held the old usages , that men with men were By themselve , and women by themselve also there . When they were each one yset , as it to their state become , Kay , king of Anjou , a thousand knightës nome<span type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>Of noble men , yclothed in ermine each one Of one suit , and served at this noble feast anon . Bedwer the botyler , king of Normandy , Nome also in his half a fair company Of one suit for to serve of the hotelery . Before the queen it was also of all such courtesy , For to tell all the nobley that there was ydo , Though my tongue were of steel , me should nought dure thereto . Women ne kept of no knight in druery ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 4 ]</span>But he were in arms well yproved , and atte least thrye .<span type="note_anchor">[ 5 ]</span>That made , lo , the women the chaster life lead , And the knights the stalwarder , and the better in their deed . Soon after this noble meat , as right was of such tide , The knights atyled them about in eachë side , In fields and in meadows to prove their bachlery ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 6 ]</span>Some with lance , some with sword , without villany , With playing at tables , other attë chekere ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 7 ]</span>With casting , other with setting ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 8 ]</span>other in some other mannere . And which so of any game had the mastery , The king them of his giftës did large courtesy . Up the alurs<span type="note_anchor">[ 9 ]</span>of the castle the ladies then stood , And beheld this noble game , and which knights were good . All the three extë dayës<span type="note_anchor">[ 10 ]</span>ylastë this nobley , In halle 's and in fieldës , of meat and eke of play . These men come the fourth day before the kingë there , And he gave them large gifts , ever as they worthy were .

AN OLD TRADITION . It was a tradition invented by the old fablers that giants brought the stones of Stonehenge from the most sequestered deserts of Africa , and placed them in Ireland ; that every stone was washed with juices of herbs , and contained a medical power ; and that Merlin , the magician , at the request of King Arthur , transported them from Ireland , and erected them in circles on the plain of Amesbury , as a sepulchral monument for the Britons treacherously slain by Hengist . This fable is thus delivered , without decoration , by Robert of Glocester :— ‘ Sir king , ’ quoth Merlin then , ‘ such thingë 's ywis Ne be for to shew nought , but when great need is , For if I said in bismare , other but it need were , Soon from me he would wend , the ghost that doth me lere . '[ 1 ] The king , then none other n'as , bid him some quaintise Bethink about thilk cors that so noble were and wise .<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>‘ Sir King , ’ quoth Merlin then , ‘ if thou wilt here cast In the honour of men , a work that ever shall ylast , To the hill of Kylar<span type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>send in to Ireland , After the noble stonës that there habbet<span type="note_anchor">[ 4 ]</span>long ystand ; That was the treche of giants ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 5 ]</span>for a quaintë work there is Of stonës all with art ymade , in the world such none is . Ne there n'is nothing that me should myd<span type="note_anchor">[ 6 ]</span>strength adownë cast . Stood they here , as they doth there , ever a woulde last . ’ The king somdeal to-lygh<span type="note_anchor">[ 7 ]</span>, when he heardë this tale : ‘ How might , ’ he said , ‘ such stonës , so great and so fale ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 8 ]</span>Be ybrought of so far land ? And yet mist of were , Me would ween that in this landë no stone to wonke n'ere . ’ Sir king , ’ quoth Merlin , ‘ ne make nought an idle such laughing ; For it n'is an idle nought that I tell this tiding . For in the farrest stude of Afric giants whilë fet<span type="note_anchor">[ 9 ]</span>These stones for medicine and in Ireland them set , While they wonenden in Ireland to make their bathë 's there , There under for to bathë when they sick were . For they would the stonës wash and therein bathe ywis ; For is no stone there among that of great virtue n'is . ’ The king and his counsel rode the stones for to fet , And with great power of battle if any more them let . Uther , the kingë 's brother , that Ambrose hett<span type="note_anchor">[ 10 ]</span>also , In another namë ychosë was thereto , And fifteen thousand men , this deedë for to do , And Merlin for his quaintise thither went also .<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>If I should say any thing out of wantonness or vanity , the spirit which teaches me would immediately leave me .<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>Bade him use his cunning , for the sake of the bodies of those noble and wise Britons .<span type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>‘ Kylar : ’ Kildare .<span type="note_anchor">[ 4 ]</span>‘ Habbet : ’ have .<span type="note_anchor">[ 5 ]</span>‘ The treche of giants : ’ ‘ The dance of giants . ’ The name of this collection of immense stones .<span type="note_anchor">[ 6 ]</span>‘ Myd : ’ with .<span type="note_anchor">[ 7 ]</span>‘ Somdeal to-lygh : ’ somewhat laughed .<span type="note_anchor">[ 8 ]</span>‘ Fale : ’ many .<span type="note_anchor">[ 9 ]</span>Giants once brought them from the furthest part of Africa .<span type="note_anchor">[ 10 ]</span>‘ Hett : ’ was called . ARTHUR 'S INTRIGUE WITH YGERNE . At the feast of Easter the king sent his sond ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>That they comen all to<settlement>London</settlement>the high men of this lond , And the ladies all so good , to his noble feast wide , For he shouldë crown here , for the high tide . All the noble men of this land to the noble feast come , And their wivës and their daughtren with them many nome ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>This feast was noble enow , and nobliche ydo ; For many was the fair lady that ycome was thereto . Ygerne , Gorloys ’ wife , was fairest of each one , That was Countess of Cornëwall , for so fair n'as there none . The king beheld her fast enow , and his heart on her cast , And thoughtë , though he were wise , to do folly at last . He made her semblant fair enow , to none other so great . The earl n'as not therewith ypayed<span type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>, when he it under get . After meat he nome his wife myd<span type="note_anchor">[ 4 ]</span>sturdy med enow , And , without leave of the king , to his country drow . The king sentë to him then , to byleve<span type="note_anchor">[ 5 ]</span>all night , For he must of great counsel havë some insight . That was for nought . Would he not , the king sent yet his sond , That he byleved at his parlement , for need of the lond . The king was , when he n'oldë not , anguyssous and wroth . For despite he would a-wreak be he sworë his oath , But he come to amendëment . His power attë last He garked , and went forth to Cornëwall fast . Gorloys his castles a store all about . In a strong castle he did his wife , for of her was all his doubt , In another himself he was , for he n'oldë nought , If cas<span type="note_anchor">[ 6 ]</span>come , that they were both to death ybrought . The castle , that the earl in was , the king besieged fast , For he might not his gins for shame to the other cast . Then he was there seen not , and he speddë nought , Ygerne , the countessë , so much was in his thought , That he nustë none other wit , ne he ne might for shame Tell it but a privy knight , Ulfyn was his name , That he trustë most to . And when the knight heard thia , ‘ Sir , ’ he said , ‘ I ne can wit , what rede hereof is , For the castle is so strong , that the lady is in , For I ween all the land ne should it myd strengthë win . For the sea goeth all about , but entry one there n'is , And that is up on hardë rocks , and so narrow way it is , That there may go but one and one , that three men within Might slay all the laud , ere they come therein . And nought for then , if Merlin at the counsel were , If any might , he couthë the best rede thee lere . '[ 7 ] Merlin was soon of sent , pled it was him soon , That he should the best rede say , what were to don . Merlin was sorry enow for the kingë 's folly , And natheless , ‘ Sir king , ’ he said , ‘ there may to mast'ry , The earl hath two men him near , Brithoel and Jordan . I will make thyself , if thou wilt , through art that I can , Have all the formë of the earl , as thou were right he , And Olfyn as Jordan , and as Brithoel me . ’ This art was all clean ydo , that all changed they were , They three in the others ’ form , the solve as it were . Against even he went forth , nustë<span type="note_anchor">[ 8 ]</span>no man that cas ; To the castle they come right as it even was . The porter ysaw his lord come , and his most privy twei , With good heart he let his lord in , and his men bey . The countess was glad enow , when her lord to her come And either other in their arms myd great joy nome . When they to beddë come , that so long a-two were , With them was so great delight , that between them there Begot was the best body , that ever was in this land , King Arthur the noble man , that ever worthy understand . When the king 's men nuste amorrow , where he was become , They fared as wodëmen , and wend<span type="note_anchor">[ 9 ]</span>he were ynome .<span type="note_anchor">[ 10 ]</span>They assaileden the castle , as it should adown anon , They that within were , garked them each one , And smote out in a full will , and fought myd there fone : So that the earl was yslaw , and of his men many one , And the castle was ynome , and the folk to-sprad there , Yet , though they haddë all ydo , they ne found not the king there . The tiding to the countess soon was ycome , That her lord was yslaw , and the castle ynome . And when the messenger him saw the earl , as him thought , That he had so foul plow , full sore him of thought , The countess made somedeal deol ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 11 ]</span>for no sothness they nustë . The king , for to glad her , beclipt her and cust . ‘ Dame , ’ he said , ’ no sixt thou well , that les it is all this : Ne wo'st thou well I am alive . I will thee say how it is . Out of the castle stillëlich I went all in privity , That none of minë men it nustë , for to speak with thee . And when they mist me to-day , and nuste where I was , They fareden right as giddy men , myd whom no rede n'as , And foughtë with the folk without , and have in this mannere Ylore the castle and themselve , and well thou wo'st I am here . And for my castle , that is ylore , sorry I am enow , And for my men , that the king and his power slew . And my power is to lute , therefore I dreadë sore , Lestë the king us nyme<span type="note_anchor">[ 12 ]</span>here , and sorrow that we were more . Therefore I will , how so it be , wend against the king , And make my peace with him , ere he us to shamë bring . ’ Forth he went , and het<span type="note_anchor">[ 13 ]</span>his men if the king come , That they shouldë him the castle yield , ere he with strength it nome . So he come toward his men , his own form he nome , And leaved the earl 's form , and the king Uther become .

The next name of note is Robert , commonly called De Brunne . His real name was Robert Manning . He was born at Malton in Yorkshire ; for some time belonged to the house of Sixhill , a Gilbertine monastery in Yorkshire ; and afterwards became a member of Brunne or Browne , a priory of black canons in the same county . When monastical writers became famous , they were usually designated from the religious houses to which they belonged . Thus it was with Matthew of Westminster , William of Malmesbury , and John of Glastonbury — all received their appellations from their respective monasteries . De Brunne 's principal work is a Chronicle of the History of<country>England</country>, in rhyme . It can in no way be considered an original production , but is partly translated , and partly compiled from the writings of Maistre Wace and Peter de Langtoft , which latter was a canon of Bridlington in Yorkshire , of Norman origin , but born in<country>England</country>, and the author of an entire History of his country in French verse , down to the end of the reign of Edward I. Brunne 's Chronicle seems to have been written about the year<date>1303</date>. We extract the Prologue , and two other passages :— THE PROLOGUE . ‘ Lordlingës that be now here , If ye willë listen and lere , All the story of<country>England</country>, As Robert Mannyng written it fand , And in English has it shewed , Not for the leared but for the lewed ;<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>For those that on this land wonn That the Latin ne Frankys conn ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>For to have solace and gamen In fellowship when they sit samen , And it is wisdom for to witten The state of the land , and have it written , “ What manner of folk first it wan , And of what kind it first began . And good it is for many things , For to hear the deeds of kings , Whilk were fools , and whilk were wise , And whilk of them couth<span type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>most quaintise ; And whilk did wrong , and whilk right , And whilk maintained peace and fight .

For Brutus to Cadwallader 's , The last Briton that this land lees .

After the Britons the English camen , The lordship of this land they nameu ; South and north , west and east , That call men now the English gest .

THE ATTACK OF RICHARD I . ON A CASTLE HELD BY THE SARACENS . The dikes were fullë wide that closed the castle about , And deep on ilka side , with bankis high without . Was there none entry that to the castle ‘ gan ligg ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>But a strait kaucë ;<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>at the end a draw-brig , With great double chainës drawen over the gate , And fifty armed swainës porters at that gate .

Of De Brunne , Warton judiciously remarks — ‘ Our author also translated into English rhymes the treatise of Cardinal Bonaventura , his contemporary , De coena et passione Domini , et paenis S. Mariae Virgins . But I forbear to give more extracts from this writer , who appears to have possessed much more industry than genius , and cannot at present be read with much pleasure . Yet it should be remembered that even such a writer as Robert de Brunne , uncouth and unpleasing as he naturally seems , and chiefly employed in turning the theology of his age into rhyme , contributed to form a style , to teach expression , and to polish his native tongue . In the infancy of language and composition , nothing is wanted but writers ;— at that period even the most artless have their use . ’ Here we may allude to the introduction of romantic fiction into English poetry . This had , as we have seen , reigned in<country>France</country>. There troubadours in Provence , and men more worthy of the name of poets in Normandy , had long sung of Brutus , of Charlemagne , and of Rollo . And thence a class , called sometimes Joculators , sometimes Jongleurs , and sometimes Minstrels , issued , harp in hand , wandering to and fro , and singing tales of chivalry and love , composed either by themselves , or by other poets living or dead . ( We refer our readers to our first volume of Percy 's ‘ Reliques , ’ for a full account of this class , and of the poetry they produced . ) These wanderers reached<country>England</country>in due time and brought with them compositions which found favour and excited emulation , or at least imitation , in our vernacular genius . Hence came a great swarm of romances , all more or less derived from the French , even when Saxon in subject and style ; such as ‘ Sir Tristrem , ’ ( which Sir Walter Scott tried in vain to prove to be written by the famous Thomas the Rhymer , of Ercildoun , or Earlston , in Berwickshire , who died before<date>1299</date>;) ‘ The Life of Alexander the Great , ’ said to be written by Adam Davie , Marshall of Stratford-le-Bow , who lived about<date>1312</date>; ‘ King Horn , ’ which certainly belongs to the latter part of the thirteenth century ; ‘ The Squire of Low Degree ; ‘ Sir Guy ; ’ ‘ Sir Degore ; ’ ‘ The King of Tars ; ’ ‘ King Robert of Sicily ; ’ ‘ La Mort d'Arthur ; ’ ‘ Impodemon ; ’ and , more lately , ‘ Sir Libius ; ’ ‘ Sir Thopas ; ’ ‘ Sir Isenbras ; ’ ‘ Gawan and Gologras ; ’ and ‘ Sir Bevis . ’ Richard I. also formed the subject of a very popular romance . We give extracts from it :— THE SOLDAN SALADIN SENDS KING RICHARD A HORSE . ‘ Thou sayst thy God is full of might : Wilt thou grant with spear and shield , To detryve the right in the field , With helm , hauberk , and brandës bright , On strongë steedës good and light , Whether be of more power , Thy God almight , or Jupiter ? And he sent rue to sayë this If thou wilt have an horse of his , In all the lands that thou hast gone Such ne thou sawest never none : Favel of Cyprus , ne Lyard of Prys ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>Be not at need as he is ; And if thou wilt , this samë day , He shall be brought thee to assay . ’ Richard answered , ‘ Thou sayest well Such a horse , by Saint Michael , I would have to ride upon .—— Bid him send that horse to me , And I shall assay what he be , If he be trusty , withoutë fail , I keep none other to me in battail . ’ The messengers then homë went , And told the Soldan in present , That Richard in the field would come him unto : The rich Soldan bade to come him unto A noble clerk that couldë well conjure , That was a master necromansour : He commanded , as I you tell , Thorough the fiendë 's might of hell , Two strong fiendë 's of the air , In likeness of two steedës fair , Both like in hue and hair , As men said that there were : No man saw never none sich ; That one was a mare iliche , That other a colt , a noble steed , Where that he were in any mead , ( Were the knight never so bold . ) When the mare neigh wold , ( That him should hold against his will ,) But soon he wouldë go her till , And kneel down and suck his dame , Therewith the Soldan with shame Shouldë king Richard quell , All this an angel ‘ gan him tell , That to him came about midnight . ‘ Awake , ’ he said , ‘ Goddis knight : My Lord doth thee to understand That thee shalt come an horse to land , Fair it is , of body ypight , To betray thee if the Soldan might ; On him to ride have thou no drede For he thee helpë shall at need . ’ The angel gives king Richard several directions about managing this infernal horse , and a general engagement ensuing , between the Christian and Saracen armies , He leapt on horse when it was light ; Ere he in his saddle did leap Of many thingës he took keep .— His men brought them that he bade , A square tree of forty feet , Before his saddle anon he it set , Fast that they should it brase , &amp; c. Himself was richëly begone , From the crest right to the tone ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>He was covered wondrously wele All with splentës of good steel , And there above an hauberk . A shaft he had of trusty werk , Upon his shoulders a shield of steel , With the libards<span type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>painted wele ; And helm he had of rich entaile , Trusty and true was his ventaile : Upon his crest a dovë white , Significant of the Holy Sprite , Upon a cross the dovë stood Of gold ywrought rich and good , God<span type="note_anchor">[ 4 ]</span>himself , Mary and John , As he was done the rood upon ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 5 ]</span>In significance for whom he fought , The spear-head forgat he nought , Upon his shaft he would it have Goddis name thereon was grave ; Now hearken what oath he sware , Ere they to the battaile went there : ‘ If it were so , that Richard might Slay the Soldan in field with fight , At our willë evereachone He and his should gone Into the city of Babylon ; And the king of Macedon He should have under his hand ; And if the Soldan of that land Might slay Richard in the field With sword or spearë under shield , That Christian men shouldë go Out of that land for evermo , And the Saracens their will in wold . ’ Quoth king Richard , ‘ Thereto I hold , Thereto my glove , as I am knight . ’ They be armed and ready dight : King Richard to his saddle did leap , Certes , who that would takë keep To see that sight it were sair ; Their steedës rannë with great ayre ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 6 ]</span>All so hard as they might dyre ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 7 ]</span>After their feetë sprang out fire : Tabors and trumpettës ‘ gan blow : There men might see in a throw How king Richard , that noble man , Encountered with the Soldan , The chief was toldë of Damas , His trust upon his marë was , And therefor , as the book<span type="note_anchor">[ 8 ]</span>us tells , His crupper hungë full of bells , And his peytrel<span type="note_anchor">[ 9 ]</span>and his arsowne<span type="note_anchor">[ 10 ]</span>Three mile men might hear the soun .

Then was there a dragon great and grim , Full of fire and also venim , With a wide throat and tuskës great , Upon that knight fast ‘ gan he beat . And as a lion then was his feet , His tail was long , and full unmeet : Between his head and his tail Was twenty-two foot withouten fail ; His body was like a wine tun , He shone full bright against the sun : His eyes were bright as any glass , His scales were hard as any brass ; And thereto he was necked like a horse , He bare his head up with great force : The breath of his mouth that did out blow As it had been a fire on lowe<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>.

Davie was also the author of an original poem , entitled , ‘ Visions in Verse , ’ and of the ‘ Battle of Jerusalem , ’ in which he versifies a French romance . In this production Pilate is represented as challenging our Lord to single combat ! In<date>1349</date>, died Richard Rollo , a hermit , and a verse-writer . He lived a secluded life near the nunnery of Hampole in Yorkshire , and wrote a number of devotional pieces , most of them very dull . In<date>1350</date>, Lawrence Minot produced some short narrative ballads on the victories of Edward III ., beginning with Halidon Hill , and ending with the siege of Guisnes Castle . His works lay till the end of the last century obscure in a MS. of the Cotton Collection , which was supposed to be a transcript of the Works of Chaucer . On a spare leaf of the MS. there had been accidentally written a name , probably that of its original possessor , ‘ Richard Chawsir . ’ This the getter-up of the Cotton catalogue imagined to be the name of Geoffrey Chaucer . Mr Tyrwhitt , while foraging for materials to his edition of ‘ The Canterbury Tales , ’ accidentally found out who the real writer was ; and Ritson afterwards published Minot 's ballads , which are ten in number , written in the northern dialect , and in an alliterative style , and with considerable spirit and liveliness . He has been called the Tyrtaeus of his age . We come now to the immediate predecessor of Chaucer — Robert Langlande . He was a secular priest , born at Mortimer 's Cleobury , in Shropshire , and educated at Oriel College ,<settlement>Oxford</settlement>. He wrote , towards the end of the fourteenth century , a very remarkable work , entitled , ‘ Visions of William concerning Piers Plowman . ’ The general object of this poem is to denounce the abuses of society , and to inculcate , upon both clergy and laity , their respective duties . One William is represented as falling asleep among the Malvern Hills , and sees in his dream a succession of visions , in which great ingenuity , great boldness , and here and there a powerful vein of poetry , are displayed . Truth is described as a magnificent tower , and Falsehood as a deep dungeon . In one canto Religion descends , and gives a long harangue about what should be the conduct of society and of individuals . Bribery and Falsehood , in another part of the poem , seek a marriage with each other , and make their way to the courts of justice , where they find many friends . Some very whimsical passages are introduced . The Power of Grace confers upon Piers Plowman , who stands for the Christian Life , four stout oxen , to cultivate the field of Truth . These are Matthew , Mark , Luke , and John , the last of whom is described as the gentlest of the team . She afterwards assigns him the like number of stots or bullocks , to harrow what the evangelists had ploughed , and this new horned team consists of Saint or Stot Ambrose , Stot Austin , Stot Gregory , and Stot Jerome . Apart from its fantastic structure , ‘ Piers Plowman ’ was not only a sign of the times , but did great service in its day . His voice rings like that of Israel 's minor prophets — like Nahum or Hosea — in a dark and corrupt age . He proclaims liberal and independent sentiments , he attacks slavery and superstition , and he predicts the doom of the Papacy as with a thunder-knell . Chaucer must have felt roused to his share of the reformatory work by the success of ‘ Piers Plowman ; ’ Spenser is suspected to have read and borrowed from him ; and even Milton , in his description of a lazar-house in ‘ Paradise Lost , ’ had him probably in his eye . ( See our last extract from ‘ Piers . ’ ) On account of the great merit and peculiarity of this work we proceed to make rather copious extracts . HUMAN LIFE .

COVETOUSNESS . And then came Covetise ; can I him no descrive , So hungerly and hollow , so sternëly he looked , He was bittle-browed and baberlipped also ; With two bleared eyen as a blindë hag , And as a leathern pursë lolled his cheekës , Well sider than his chin they shivered for cold : And as a bondman of his bacon his beard was bidrauled , With a hood on his head , and a lousy hat above . And in a tawny tabard ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>of twelve winter age , Allë torn and baudy , and full of lice creeping ; But that if a louse could have leapen the better , She had not walked on the welt , so was it threadbare . ‘ I have been Covetise , ’ quoth this caitiff , ‘ For sometime I served Symmë at style , And was his prentice plight , his profit to wait .

THE PRELATES . And now is religion a rider , a roamer by the street , A leader of lovëdays ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>and a loudë<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>beggar , A pricker on a palfrey from manor to manor , An heap of houndës at his arse as he a lord were . And if but his knave kneel , that shall his cope bring , He loured on him , and asked who taught him courtesy .<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>‘ Lovëdays : ’ ladies .<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>‘ Loudë : ’ lewd . MERCY AND TRUTH . Out of the west coast , a wench , as methought , Came walking in the way , to heavenward she looked ; Mercy hight that maidë , a meek thing withal , A full benign birdë , and buxom of speech ; Her sister , as it seemed , came worthily walking , Even out of the east , and westward she looked , A full comely creature , Truth she hight , For the virtue that her followed afeared was she never . When these maidens met , Mercy and Truth , Either asked other of this great marvel , Of the din and of the darkness , &amp; c. NATURE , OR KIND , SENDING FORTH HIS DISEASES FROM THE PLANETS , AT THE COMMAND OF CONSCIENCE , AND OF HIS ATTENDANTS , AGE AND DEATH . Kind Conscience then heard , and came out of the planets , And sent forth his forriours , Fevers and Fluxes , Coughës and Cardiacles , Crampës and Toothaches , Rheumës , and Radgondes , and raynous Scallës , Boilës , and Botches , and burning Agues , Phreneses and foul Evil , foragers of Kind ! There was ‘ Harow ! and Help ! here cometh Kind , With Death that is dreadful , to undo us all ! ’ The lord that liveth after lust then aloud cried . Age the hoar , he was in the va-ward , And bare the banner before Death : by right he it claimed . Kindë came after , with many keenë sorës , As Pocks and Pestilences , and much people shent . So Kind through corruptions , killed full many : Death came driving after , and all to dust pashed Kings and Kaisers , knightës and popës . Many a lovely lady , and leman of knights , Swooned and swelted for sorrow of Death 's dints . Conscience , of his courtesy , to Kind he besought To cease and sufire , and see where they would Leave Pride privily , and be perfect Christian , And Kind ceased then , to see the people amend . ‘ Piers Plowman ’ found many imitators . One wrote ‘ Piers the Plowman 's Crede ; ’ another , ‘ The Plowman 's Tale ; ’ another , a poem on ‘ Alexander the Great ; ‘ another , on the ‘ Wars of the Jews ; ’ and another , ‘ A Vision of Death and Life , ’ extracts from all which may be found in Warton 's ‘ History of English Poetry . ’ We close this preliminary essay by giving a very ancient hymn to the Virgin , as a specimen of the once universally-prevalent alliterative poetry .

Hail be you , Mary , mother and may , Mild , and meek , and merciable ; Hail , folliche fruit of soothfast fay , Against each strife steadfast and stable ; Hail , soothfast soul in each , a say , Under the sun is none so able ; Hail , lodge that our Lord in lay , The foremost that never was founden in fable ; Hail , true , truthful , and tretable , Hail , chief ychosen of chastity , Hail , homely , hendy , and amiable : To pray for us to thy Sonë so free !

AVE , &amp; c. &amp; c.<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>‘ Botenere : ’ helper . ADVERTISEMENT . It will be observed that , in the specimens given of the earlier poets , the spelling has been modernised on the principle which has been so generally approved in its application to the text of Chaucer and of Spenser . On a further examination of the material for ‘ Specimens and Memoirs of the less-known British Poets , ’ it has been deemed advisable to devote three volumes to this résumé , and merely to give extracts from Cowley , instead of following out the arrangement proposed when the issue for this year was announced . In this space it has been found possible to present the reader with specimens of almost all those authors whose writings were at any period esteemed . The series will thus be rendered more perfect , and will include the complete works of the authors whose entire writings are by a general verdict regarded as worthy of preservation ; together with representations of the style , and brief notices of the poets who have , during the progress of our literature , occupied a certain rank , but whose popularity and importance have in a great measure passed . It is confidently hoped that the arrangements now made will give a completeness to the First Division of the Library Edition of the British Poets — from Chaucer to Cowper — which will be acceptable and satisfactory to the general reader .

     <head>JOHN GOWER</head>
     <p>Very little is told us ( as usual in the beginnings of a literature ) of the life and private history of Gower , and that little is not specially authentic or clearly consistent with itself . His life consists mainly of a series of suppositions , with one or two firm facts between — like a few stepping-stones insulated in wide spaces of water . He is said to have been born about the year 1325 , and if so must have been a few years older than Chaucer ; whom he , however , outlived . He was a friend as well as contemporary of that great poet , who , in the fifth book of his ‘ Troilus and Cresseide , ’ thus addresses him :—</p>
     <lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">‘ O moral Gower , this bookë I direct ,</l>
       <l n="2">To thee and the philosophical Strood ,</l>

       <l n="4">Of your benignities and zealës good . ’</l>

     <p>The place of Gower 's birth has been the subject of much controversy . Caxton asserts that he was a native of Wales . Leland , Bales , Pits , Hollingshed , and Edmondson contend , on the other hand , that he belonged to the Statenham family , in Yorkshire . In proof of this , a deed is appealed to , which is preserved among the ancient records of the Marquis of Stafford . To this deed , of which the local date is Statenham , and the chronological 1346 , one of the subscribing witnesses is John Gower who on the back of the deed is stated , in the handwriting of at least a century later , to be ‘ Sr John Gower the Poet ’ . Whatever may be thought of this piece of evidence , ‘ the proud tradition , ’ adds Todd , who had produced it , ‘ in the Marquis of Stafford 's family has been , and still is , that the poet was of Statenham ; and who would not consider the dignity of his genealogy augmented by enrolling among its worthies the moral Gower ? ’</p>
     <p>From his will we know that he possessed the manor of Southwell , in the county of Nottingham , and that of Multon , in the county of Suffolk . He was thus a rich man , as well as probably a knight . The latter fact is inferred from the circumstance of his effigies in the church of St Mary Overies wearing a chaplet of roses , such as , says Francis Thynne , ‘ the knyghtes in old time used , either of gold or other embroiderye , made after the fashion of roses , one of the peculiar ornamentes of a knighte , as well as his collar of S. S. S ., his guilte sword and spurres . Which chaplett or circle of roses was as well attributed to knyghtes , the lowest degree of honor , as to the higher degrees of duke , erle , &amp; c ., being knyghtes , for so I have seen John of Gaunte pictured in his chaplett of roses ; and King , Edwarde the Thirde gave his chaplett to Eustace Rybamonte ; only the difference was , that as they were of lower degree , so had they fewer roses placed on their chaplett or cyrcle of golde , one ornament deduced from the dukes crowne , which had the roses upon the top of the cyrcle , when the knights had them only upon the cyrcle or garlande itself . ’</p>
     <p>It has been said that Gower as well as Chaucer studied in the Temple . This , however , Thynne doubts , on the ground that ‘ it is most certeyn to be gathered by cyrcumstances of recordes that the lawyers were not in the Temple until towardes the latter parte of the reygne of Kinge Edwarde the Thirde , at whiche tyme Chaucer was a grave manne , holden in greate credyt and employed in embassye ; ’ and when , of course , Gower , being his senior , must have been ‘ graver ’ still .</p>
     <p>There is scarcely anything more to relate of the personal career of our poet . In his elder days he became attached to the House of Lancaster , under Thomas of Woodstock , as Chaucer did under John of Gaunt . It is said that the two poets , who had been warm friends , at last quarrelled , but obscurity rests on the cause , the circumstances , the duration , and the consequences of the dispute . Gower , like some far greater bards , — Milton for instance , and those whom Milton has commemorated ,</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">‘ Blind Thamyris and blind Moeonides ,</l>
       <l n="2">And Tiresiaa and Phineus , prophets old , ’ —</l>
     </lg>
     <p>was sometime ere his death deprived of his sight , as we know on his own authority . It appears from his will that he was still living in 1408 , having outlived Chaucer eight years . This will is a curious document . It is that of a very rich and very superstitious Catholic , who leaves bequests to churches , hospitals , to priors , sub-priors , and priests , with the significant request ‘ ut orent pro me ’ — a request which , for the sake of the poor soul of the ‘ moral Gower , ’ was we trust devoutly obeyed , although we are irresistibly reminded of the old rhyme ,</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">‘ Pray for the soul of Gabriel John ,</l>
       <l n="2">Who died in the year one thousand and one ;</l>
       <l n="3">You may if you please , or let it alone ,</l>
       <l n="4">For it 's all one</l>
       <l n="5">To Gabriel John ,</l>
       <l n="6">Who died in the year one thousand and one . ’</l>
     </lg>
     <p>There is no mention of children in the will , and hence the assertion of Edmondson , who , in his genealogical table of the Statenham family , says that Thomas Gower , the governor of the castle of Mans in the times of the Fifth and Sixth Henrys , was the only son of the poet , and that of Glover , who , in his ‘ Visitation of Yorkshire , ’ describes Gower as married to a lady named Elizabeth , daughter of Sir Edward Sadbowrughe , Baron of the Exchequer , by whom he had five sons and three daughters , must both fall to the ground . According to the will , Gower 's wife 's name was Agnes , and he leaves to her £ 100 in legacy , besides his valuable goods and the rents accruing from his aforesaid manors of Multon , in Suffolk , and Southwell , in Nottinghamshire . His body was , according to his own direction , buried in the monastery of St Mary Overies , in Southwark , ( afterwards the church of St Saviour ,) where a monument , and an effigies , too , were erected , with the roses of a knight girdling the brow of one who was unquestionably a true , if not a great poet .</p>
     <p>In Warton 's ‘ History of English Poetry , ’ and in the ‘ Illustrations of the Lives and Writings of Gower and Chaucer ’ by Mr Todd , there will be found ample and curious details about MS. poems by Gower , such as fifty sonnets in French ; a ‘ Panegyrick on Henry IV ., ’ half in Latin and half in English , a short elegiac poem on the same subject , &amp; c .; besides a large work , entitled ‘ Speculum Meditantis , ’ a poem in French of a moral cast ; and ‘ Vox Clamantis , ’ consisting of seven books of Latin elegiacs , and chiefly filled with a metrical account of the insurrections of the Commons in the reign of Richard II . In the dedication of this latter work to Arundel , Archbishop of Canterbury , Gower speaks of his blindness and his age . He says , ‘ Hanc epistolam subscriptam corde devoto misit senex et cecus Johannes Gower reverendissimo in Christo patri ac domino suo precipuo domino Thome de Arundell , Cantuar . Archiepö . ’ &amp; c. Warton proves that the ‘ Vox Clamantis ’ was written in the year 1397 , by a line in the Bodleian manuscript of the poem , ‘ Hos ego bis deno Ricardo regis in anno . ’ Richard II . began , it is well known , to reign in the year 1377 , when ten years of age , and , of course , the year 1397 was the twentieth of his reign . It follows from this , that for eleven years at least before his death Gower had been senex et cecus , helpless through old age and blindness .</p>
     <p>The ‘ Confessio Amantis ’ is the only work of Gower 's which is printed and in English . The rest are still slumbering in MS .; and even although the ‘ Vox Clamantis ’ should put in a sleepy plea for the resurrection of print , on the whole we are disposed to say , better for all parties that it and the rest should slumber on . But the ‘ Confessio Amantis ’ is altogether a remarkable production . It is said to have been written at the command of Richard II ., who , meeting our poet rowing on the Thames , near London , took him on board the royal barge , and requested him to book some new thing . It is an English poem , in eight books , and was first printed by Caxton in the year 1483 . The ‘ Speculum Meditantis , ’ ‘ Vox Clamantis , ’ and ‘ Confessio Amantis , ’ are , properly speaking , parts of one great work , and are represented by three volumes upon Gower 's curious tomb in the old conventual church of St Mary Overies already alluded to — a church , by the way , which the poet himself assisted in rebuilding in the elegant shape which it retains to this day .</p>
     <p>The ‘ Confessio ’ is a large unwieldy collection of poetry and prose , superstition and science , love and religion , allegory and historical facts . It is crammed with all varieties of learning , and a perverse but infinite ingenuity is shewn in the arrangement of its heterogeneous materials . In one book the whole mysteries of the Hermetic philosophy are expounded , and the wonders of alchymy dazzle us in every page . In another , the poet scales the heights and sounds the depths of Aristotelianism . From this we have extracted in the ‘ Specimens ’ a glowing account of ‘ The Chariot of the Sun . ’ Throughout the work , tales and stories of every description and degree of merit are interspersed . These are principally derived from an old book called ‘ Pantheon ; or , Memoriae Seculorum , ’ — a kind of universal history , more studious of effect than accuracy , in which the author ranges over the whole history of the world , from the creation down to the year 1186 . This was a specimen of a kind of writing in which the Middle Ages abounded — namely , chronicles , which gradually superseded the monkish legends , and for a time eclipsed the classics themselves ; a kind of writing hovering between history and fiction , embracing the widest sweep , written in a barbarous style , and swarming with falsehoods ; but exciting , interesting , and often instructive , and tending to kindle curiosity , and create in the minds of their readers a love for literature .</p>
     <p>Besides chronicles , Gower had read many romances , and alludes to them in various parts of his works . His ‘ Confessio Amantis ’ was apparently written after Chaucer 's ‘ Troilus and Cresseide , ’ and after ‘ The Flower and the Leaf , ’ inasmuch as he speaks of the one and imitates the other in that poem . That Chaucer had not , however , yet composed his ‘ Testament of Love , ’ appears from the epilogue to the ‘ Confessio , ’ where Gower is ordered by Venus , who expresses admiration of Chaucer for the early devotion of his muse to her service , to say to him at the close —</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">‘ Forthy , now in his daies old ,</l>
       <l n="2">Thou shalt him tell this message ,</l>
       <l n="3">That he upon his later age</l>
       <l n="4">To set an end of all his work ,</l>
       <l n="5">As he which is mine owen clerk ,</l>
       <l n="6">Do make his Testament of Love ,</l>
       <l n="7">As thou hast done thy shrift above ,</l>
       <l n="8">So that my court it may record ’ —</l>
     </lg>
     <p>the ‘ shrift ’ being of course the ‘ Confessio Amantis . ’ In ‘ The Canterbury Tales ’ there are several indications that Chaucer was indebted to Gower — ‘ The Man of Law 's Tale ’ being borrowed from Gower 's ‘ Constantia , ’ and ‘ The Wife of Bath 's Tale ’ being founded on Gower 's ‘ Florent . ’</p>
     <p>After all , Gower cannot be classed with the greater bards . He sparkles brightly chiefly from the depth of the darkness through which he shines . He is more remarkable for extent than for depth , for solidity than for splendour , for fuel than for fire , for learning than for genius .</p>

     <p>JOHN BARBOUR .</p>
     <p>The facts known about this Scottish poet are only the following . He seems to have been born about the year 1316 , in , probably , the city of Aberdeen . This is stated by Hume of Godscroft , by Dr Mackenzie , and others , but is not thoroughly authenticated . Some think he was the son of one Andrew Barbour , who possessed a tenement in Castle Street , Aberdeen ; and others , that he was related to one Robert Barbour , who , in 1309 , received a charter of the lands of Craigie , in Forfarshire , from King Robert the Bruce . These , however , are mere conjectures , founded upon a similarity of name . It is clear , from Barbour 's after rank in the Church , that he had received a learned education , but whether in Arbroath or Aberdeen is uncertain . We know , however , that a school of divinity and canon law had existed at Aberdeen since the reign of Alexander II ., and it is conjectured that Barbour first studied there , and then at Oxford . In the year 1357 , he was undoubtedly Archdeacon of Aberdeen , since we find him , under this title , nominated by the Bishop of that diocese , one of the Commissioners appointed to meet in Edinburgh to take measures to liberate King David , who had been captured at the battle of Nevil 's Cross , and detained from that date in England . It seems evident , from the customs of the Roman Catholic Church , that he must have been at least forty when he was created Archdeacon , and this is a good reason for fixing his birth in the year 1316 .</p>
     <p>In the same year , Barbour obtained permission from Edward III ., at the request of the Scottish King , to travel through England with three scholars who were to study at Oxford , probably at Balliol College , which had , a hundred years nearly before , been founded and endowed by the wife of the famous John Balliol of Scotland . Some years afterwards , in November 1364 , he got permission to pass , accompanied by four horsemen , through England , to pursue his studies at the same renowned university . In the year 1365 , we find another casual notice of our Scottish bard . A passport has been found giving him permission from the King of England to travel , in company with six horsemen , through that country on their way to St Denis ’ , and other sacred places . It is evident that this was a religious pilgrimage on the part of Barbour and his companions .</p>
     <p>A most peripatetic poet ; verily , he must have been ; for we find another safe-conduct , dated November 1368 , granted by Edward to Barbour , permitting him , to pass through England , with two servants and their horses , on his way to France , for the purpose of pursuing his studies there . Dr Jamieson ( see his ‘ Life of Barbour ’ ) discovers the poet 's name in the list of Auditors of the Exchequer .</p>
     <p>Barbour has himself told us that he commenced his poem in the ‘ yer of grace , a thousand thre hundyr sevynty and five , ’ when , of course , he was in his sixtieth year , or , as he says , ‘ off hys eld sexty . ’ It is supposed that David II .— who died in 1370 — had urged Barbour to engage in the work , which was not , however , completed till the fifth year of his successor , Robert II ., who gave our poet a pension on account of it . This consisted of a sum of ten pounds Scots from the revenues of the city of Aberdeen , and twenty shillings from the burgh mails . Mr James Bruce , to whose interesting Life of Barbour , in his ‘ Eminent Men of Aberdeen , ’ we are indebted for many of the facts in this narrative , says , ‘ The latter of these sums was granted to him , not merely during his own life , but to his assignees ; and the Archdeacon bequeathed it to the dean , canons , the chapter , and other ministers of the Cathedral of Aberdeen , on condition that they should for ever celebrate a yearly mass for his soul . At the Reformation , when it came to be discovered that masses did no good to souls in the other world , it is probable that this endowment reverted to the Crown . ’</p>
     <p>Barbour also wrote a poem under what seems now the strange title , ‘ The Brute . ’ This was in reality a metrical history of Scotland , commencing with the fables concerning Brutus , or ‘ Brute , ’ who , according to ancient legends , was the great-grandson of Aeneas — came over from Italy , the land of his birth — landed at Totness , in Devonshire — destroyed the giants who then inhabited Albion — called the island ‘ Britain ’ from his own name , and became its first monarch . From this original fable , Barbour is supposed to have wandered on through a hundred succeeding stories of similar value , till he came down to his own day . There can be little regret felt , therefore , that the book is totally lost . Wynton , in his ‘ Chronicle , ’ refers to it in commendatory terms ; but it cannot be ascertained from his notices whether it was composed in Scotch or in Latin .</p>
     <p>Barbour died about the beginning of the year 1396 , eighty years of age . Lord Hailes ascertained the time of his death from the Chartulary of Aberdeen , where , under the date of 10th August 1398 , mention is made of ‘ quondam Joh . Barber , Archidiaconus , Aberd ., and where it is said that he had died two years and a half before , namely , in 1396 . ’</p>
     <p>His great work , ‘ The Bruce , ’ or more fully , ‘ The History of Robert Bruce , King of the Scots , ’ does not appear to have been printed till 1616 in Edinburgh . Between that date and the year 1790 , when Pinkerton 's edition appeared , no less than twenty impressions were published , ( the principal being those of Edinburgh in 1620 and 1648 ; Glasgow , 1665 ; and Edinburgh , 1670 — all in black letter ,) so popular immediately became the poem . Pinkerton 's edition is in three volumes , and has a preface , notes , and a glossary , all of considerable value . The MS. was copied from a volume in the Advocates ’ Library , of the date of 1489 , which was in the handwriting of one John Ramsay , believed to have been the prior of a Carthusian monastery near Perth . Pinkerton first divided ‘ The Bruce ’ into books . It had previously , like the long works of Naerius and Ennius , the earliest Roman poets , consisted of one entire piece , woven ‘ from the top to the bottom without seam , ’ like the ancient simple garments in Jewry . The late respectable and very learned Dr Jamieson , of Nicolson Street United Secession Church , Edinburgh , well known as the author of the ‘ Scottish Dictionary , ’ ‘ Hermes Scythicus , ’ &amp; c ., published , in 1820 , a more accurate edition of ‘ The Bruce , ’ along with Blind Harry 's ‘ Wallace , ’ in two quarto volumes .</p>
     <p>In strict chronology Barbour belongs to an earlier date than Chaucer , having been born and having died a few years before him . But as the first Scotch poet who has written anything of length , with the exception of the author of the ‘ Romance of Sir Tristrem , ’ he claims a conspicuous place in our ‘ Specimens . ’ He was singularly fortunate in the choice of a subject . With the exception of Wallace , there is no name in Scottish history that even yet calls up prouder associations than that of Robert Bruce . The incidents in his history ,— the escape he made from English bondage to rescue his country from the same yoke ; his rise refulgent from the stroke which , in the cloisters of the Gray Friars , Dumfries , laid the Red Comyn low ; his daring to be crowned at Scone ; his frequent defeats ; his lion-like retreat to the Hebrides , accompanied by one or two friends , his wife meanwhile having been carried captive , three of his brothers hanged , and himself supposed to be dead ; the romantic perils he survived , and the victories he gained amidst the mountains where the deep waters of the river Awe are still telling of his name , and the echoes of Ben Cruachan repeating the immortal sound ; his sudden reappearance on the west coast of Scotland , where , as he ‘ shook his Carrick spear , ’ his country rose , kindling around him like heather on flame ; the awful suspense of the hour when it was announced that Edward I ., the tyrant of the Ragman 's Roll , the murderer of Wallace , was approaching with a mighty army to crush the revolt ; the electrifying news that he had died at Sark , as if struck by the breath of the fatal Border , which he had reached , but could not overpass ; the bloody summer 's day of Bannockburn , in which Edward II . was repelled , and the gallant army of his father annihilated ; the energy and wisdom of the Bruce 's civil administration after the victory ; the less famous , but noble battle of Byland , nine years after Bannockburn , in which he again smote the foes of his country ; and the recognition which at last he procured , on the accession of Edward III ., of the independence of Scotland in 1329 , himself dying the same year , his work done and his glory for ever secured ,— not to speak of the beautiful legends which have clustered round his history like ivy round an ancestral tower — of the spider on the wall , teaching him the lesson of perseverance , as he lay in the barn sad and desponding in heart — of the strange signal-light upon the shore near his maternal castle of Turnberry , which led him to land , while</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">‘ Dark red the heaven above it glow 'd ,</l>
       <l n="2">Dark red the sea beneath it flow 'd ,</l>
       <l n="3">Red rose the rocks on ocean 's brim ,</l>
       <l n="4">In blood-red light her islets swim ,</l>
       <l n="5">Wild screams the dazzled sea-fowl gave ,</l>
       <l n="6">Dropp 'd from their crags a plashing wave ,</l>
       <l n="7">The deer to distant covert drew ,</l>
       <l n="8">The blackcock deem 'd it day , and crew ; ’</l>
     </lg>
     <p>and last , not least , the adventures of his gallant , unquenchable heart , when , in the hand of Douglas ,— meet casket for such a gem !— it marched onwards , as it was wont to do , in conquering power , toward the Holy Land ;— all this has woven a garland round the brow of Bruce which every civilised nation has delighted to honour , and given him besides a share in the affections and the pride of his own land , with the joy of which ‘ no stranger can intermeddle . ’</p>
     <p>Bruce has been fortunate in his laureates , consisting of three of Scotland 's greatest poets ,— Barbour , Scott , and Burns . The last of these has given us a glimpse of the patriot-king , revealing him on the brow of Bannockburn as by a single flash of lightning . The second has , in ‘ The Lord of the Isles , ’ seized and sung a few of the more romantic passages of his history . But Barbour has , with unwearied fidelity and no small force , described the whole incidents of Bruce 's career , and reared to his memory , not an insulated column , but a broad and deep-set temple of poetry .</p>
     <p>Barbour 's poem has always been admired for its strict accuracy of statement , to which Bower , Wynton , Hailes , Pinkerton , Jamieson , and Sir Walter Scott all bear testimony ; for the picturesque force of its natural descriptions ; for its insight into character , and the lifelike spirit of its individual sketches ; for the martial vigour of its battle - pictures ; for the enthusiasm which he feels , and makes his reader feel , for the valiant and wise , the sagacious and persevering , the bold , merciful , and religious character of its hero , and for the piety which pervades it , and proves that the author was not merely a churchman in profession , but a Christian at heart . Its defects of rude rhythm , irregular constructions , and obsolete phraseology , are those of its age ; but its beauties , its unflagging interest , and its fine poetic spirit , are characteristic of the writer 's own genius .</p>

      <head>ANDREW WYNTOUN .</head>
      <head>This author , who was prior of St Serf 's monastery in Loch Leven , is the author of what he calls ‘ An Orygynale Cronykil of Scotland . ’ It appeared about the year 1420 . It is much inferior to the work of Barbour in poetry , but is full of historical information , anecdote , and legend . The language is often sufficiently prosaic . Thus the poet begins to describe the return of King David II . from his captivity , referred to above .</head>
       <l n="1">‘ Yet in prison was king Davy ,</l>
       <l n="2">And when a lang time was gane bye ,</l>
       <l n="3">Frae prison and perplexitie</l>
       <l n="4">To Berwick castle brought was he ,</l>
       <l n="5">With the Earl of Northamptoun ,</l>
       <l n="6">For to treat there of his ransoun ;</l>
       <l n="7">Some lords of Scotland come there ,</l>
       <l n="8">And als prelates that wisest were , ’ &amp; c .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>Contemporary , or nearly so , with Wyntoun were several other Scottish writers , such as one Hutcheon , of whom we know only that he is designated of the ‘ Awle Ryall , ’ or of the Royal Hall or Palace , and that he wrote a metrical romance , of which two cantos remain , called ‘ The Gest of Arthur ; ’ and another , named Clerk of Tranent , the author of a romance , entitled ‘ The Adventures of Sir Gawain . ’ Of this latter also two cantos only are extant . Although not perhaps deserving to have even portions of them extracted , they contain a good deal of poetry . A person , too , of the name of Holland , about whose history we have no information , produced a satirical poem , called ‘ The Howlate , ’ written in the allegorical form , and bearing some resemblance to ‘ Pierce Plowman 's Vision . ’</p>

      <head>BLIND HARRY .</head>
      <head>Although there are diversities of opinion as to the exact time when this blind minstrel flourished , we prefer alluding to him at this point , where he stands in close proximity to Barbour , the author of a poem on a subject so cognate to ‘ Wallace ’ as ‘ Bruce . ’ Nothing is known of Harry but that he was blind from infancy , that he composed this poem , and gained a subsistence by reciting or singing portions of it through the country . Another Wandering Willie , ( see ‘ Redgauntlet , ’ ) he ‘ passed like night from land to land , ’ led by his own instincts , and wherever he met with a congenial audience , he proceeded to chant portions of the noble knight 's achievements , his eyes the while twinkling , through their sad setting of darkness , with enthusiasm , and often suffused with tears . In some minds the conception of this blind wandering bard may awaken ludicrous emotions , but to us it suggests a certain sublimity . Blind Harry has powerfully described Wallace standing in the light and shrinking from the ghost of Fawdoun , ( see the ‘ Battle of Black - Earnside , ’ in the ‘ Specimens , ’ ) but Harry himself seems walking in the light of the ghost of Wallace , and it ministers to him , not terror , but inspiration . Entering a cot at night , and asked for a tale , he begins , in low tones , to recite that frightful apparition at Gaskhall , and the aged men and the crones vie with the children in drawing near the ‘ ingle bleeze , ’ as if in fire alone lay the refuge from</head>

       <l n="1">‘ Fawdoun , that ugly sire ,</l>
       <l n="2">That haill hall he had set into a fire ,</l>
       <l n="3">As to his sight , his OWN HEAD IN HIS HAND . ’</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="4">Arriving in a village at the hour of morning rest and refreshment , he</l>
       <l n="5">charms the swains by such words as</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="6">‘ The merry day sprang from the orient</l>
       <l n="7">With beams bright illuminate the Occident ,</l>
       <l n="8">After Titan Phoebus upriseth fair ,</l>
       <l n="9">High in the sphere the signs he made declare .</l>
       <l n="10">Zephyrus then began his morning course ,</l>
       <l n="11">The sweet vapour thus from the ground resourse , ’ &amp; c .—</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>and the simple villagers wonder at hearing these images from one who is blind , not seeing the sun . As the leaves are rustling down from the ruddy trees of late autumn , he sings to a little circle of wayside wanderers —</p>
     <lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">‘ The dark region appearing wonder fast ,</l>

       <l n="6">For adversours that in their way would hide . ’</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>And while on the verge of the December sky , the wintry sun is trembling and about to set as if for ever , then is the Minstrel 's voice heard sobbing amidst the sobs of his hearers , as he tells how his hero 's sun went down while it was yet day .</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">‘ On Wednesday the false Southron furth brocht</l>
       <l n="2">To martyr him as they before had wrocht ,</l>
       <l n="3">Of men in arms led him a full great rout ,</l>
       <l n="4">With a bauld sprite guid Wallace blent about . ’</l>
     </lg>
     <p>There can be little doubt that Blind Harry , during his lifetime , became a favourite , nay , a power in the realm . Wherever he circulated , there circulated the fame of Wallace ; there , his deeds were recounted ; there , hatred of a foreign foe , and love to their native land , were inculcated as first principles ; and long after the Homer of Scotland had breathed his last , and been consigned perhaps to some little kirkyard among the uplands , his lays continued to live ; and we know that such a man as Burns ( who read them in the modern paraphrase of William Hamilton of Gilbertfield , a book which was , till within a somewhat recent period , a household god in the libraries of the Scotch ) derived from the old singer much of ‘ that national prejudice which boiled in his breast till the floodgates of life shut in eternal rest . ’ If Barbour , as we said , was fortunate in his subject , still more was Blind Harry in his . The interest felt in Wallace is of a deeper and warmer kind than that which we feel in Bruce . Bruce was of royal blood ; Wallace was from an ancient but not wealthy family . Bruce stained his career by one great crime — great in itself , but greater from the peculiar notions of the age — the murder of Comyn in the sanctuary of Dumfries ; on the character of Wallace no similar imputation rests . Wallace initiated that plan of guerilla warfare ,— that fighting now on foot and now on the wing , now with beak and now with talons , now with horns and now with hoofs ,— which Bruce had only to perfect . Wallace was unsuccessful , and was besides treated by the King of England with revolting barbarity ; while Bruce became victorious : and , as we saw in our remarks on Chaucer , it is the unfortunate brave who stamp themselves most forcibly on a nation 's heart , and it is the red letters , which tell of suffering and death , which are with most difficulty erased from a nation 's tablets . On Bruce we look somewhat as we regard Washington ,— a great , serene man , who , after long reverses , nobly sustained , gained a notable national triumph ; to Wallace we feel , as the Italians do to Garibaldi , as a demon of warlike power ,— blending courage and clemency , enthusiasm and skill , daring and determination , in proportions almost superhuman ,— and we cry with the poet ,</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">‘ The sword that seem 'd fit for archangel to wield ,</l>
       <l n="2">Was light in his terrible hand . ’</l>
     </lg>
     <p>We have often regretted that Sir Walter Scott , who , after all , has not done full justice to Bruce in that very unequal and incondite poem ‘ The Lord of the Isles , ’ had not bent his strength upon the Ulysses bow of Wallace , and filled up that splendid sketch of a part of his history to be found near the beginning of ‘ The Fair Maid of Perth . ’ As it is , after all that a number of respectable writers , such as Miss Porter , Mrs Hemans , Findlay , the late Mr Macpherson of Glasgow , and others , have done — in prose or verse , in the novel , the poem , or the drama — to illustrate the character and career of the Scottish hero , Blind Harry remains his poet .</p>
     <p>It is necessary to notice that Harry derived , by his own account , many of the facts of his narrative from a work by John Blair , a Benedictine monk from Dundee , who acted as Wallace 's chaplain , and seems to have composed a life of him in Latin , which is lost . Besides these , he doubtless mingled in the story a number of traditions — some true , and some false — which he found floating through the country . His authority in reference to certain disputed matters , such as Wallace 's journey to France , and his capture of the Red Rover , Thomas de Longueville , who became his fast friend and fellow-soldier , was not long ago entirely established by certain important documents brought to light by the Maitland Club . It is probable that some other of his supposed misstatements — always excepting his ghost-stories — may yet receive from future researches the confirmation they as yet want . Blind Harry , living about a century and a half after the era of Wallace , and at a time when tradition was the chief literature , was not likely to be able to test the evidence of many of the circumstances which he narrated ; but he seems to speak in good faith : and , after all , what Paley says is unquestionably true as a general principle — ‘ Men tell lies about minute circumstantials , but they rarely invent . ’</p>

       <l n="87">He wist not well if that it was God 's will ;</l>
       <l n="88">Right or wrong his fortune to fulfil ,</l>
       <l n="89">Had he pleas 'd God , he trow 'd it might not bo</l>

       <l n="91">But great courage in his mind ever drave ,</l>
       <l n="92">Of Englishmen thinking amends to have .</l>
       <l n="93">As he was thus walking by him alone</l>
       <l n="94">Upon Earnside , making a piteous moan ,</l>
       <l n="95">Sir John Butler , to watch the fords right ,</l>
       <l n="96">Out from his men of Wallace had a sight ;</l>
       <l n="97">The mist again to the mountains was gone ,</l>
       <l n="98">To him he rode , where that he made his moan .</l>
       <l n="99">On loud he speir 'd ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 31 ]</span>‘ What art thou walks that gate ? ’</l>
       <l n="100">‘ A true man , Sir , though my voyage be late ;</l>

       <l n="3">Of men in arms led him a full great rout .</l>

       <l n="5">A priest he ask 'd , for God that died on tree .</l>
       <l n="6">King Edward then commanded his clergy ,</l>
       <l n="7">And said , ‘ I charge you , upon loss of life ,</l>

     <p>JAMES I . OF SCOTLAND .</p>
     <p>Here we have a great ascent from our former subject of biography — from Blind Harry to James I .— from a beggar to a king . But in the Palace of Poetry there are ‘ many mansions , ’ and men of all ranks , climes , characters , professions , and we had almost added talents , have been welcome to inhabit there . For , even as in the House Beautiful , the weak Ready-to-halt and the timid Much-afraid were as cheerfully received as the strong Honest and the bold Valiant-for-truth ; so Poetry has inspired children , and seeming fools , and maniacs , and mendicants with the finest breath of her spirit . The ‘ Fable-tree ’ Fontaine is as immortal as Corneille ; Christopher Smart 's ‘ David ’ shall live as long as Milton 's ‘ Paradise Lost ; ’ and the rude epic of a blind wanderer , whose birth , parentage , and period of death are all alike unknown , shall continue to rank in interest with the productions of one who inherited that kingdom of Scotland , the independence of which was bought by the successive efforts and the blended blood of Wallace and Bruce .</p>
     <p>Let us now look for a moment at the history and the writings of this ‘ Royal Poet . ’ The name will suggest to all intelligent readers the title of one of the most pleasing papers in Washington Irving 's ‘ Sketch-book . ’ James I. was the son of Robert III . of Scotland ,— a character familiar to all from the admirable ‘ Fair Maid of Perth , ’ — and of Annabella Stewart . He was created Earl of Carrick ; and after the miserable death of the Duke of Rothesay , his elder brother , his father , apprehensive of the further designs of Albany , determined to send James to France , to find an asylum and receive his education in that friendly Court . On his way , the vessel was captured off Flamborough Head by an English cruiser , ( the 13th of March 1405 ,) and the young prince , with his attendants , was conveyed to London , and committed to the Tower . As there was a truce between the two nations at the time , this was a flagrant outrage on the law of nations , and has indelibly disgraced the memory of Henry IV ., who , when some one remonstrated with him on the injustice of the detention , replied , with cool brutality , ‘ Had the Scots been grateful , they ought to have sent the youth to me , for I understand French well . ’ Here for nineteen years ,— during the remainder of the life of Henry IV ., and the whole of the reign of Henry V .,— James continued . He was educated , however , highly , according to the fashion of these times , — instructed in the languages , as well as in music , painting , architecture , horticulture , dancing , fencing , poetry , and other accomplishments . Still it must have fretted his high spirit to be passing his young life in prison , while without horses were stamping , plumes glistening , trumpets sounding , tournaments waging , and echoes from the great victories of Henry V. in France ringing around . One sweetener of his solitude , however , he at length enjoyed . Having been transferred from the Tower to Windsor Castle , he beheld one day from its windows that beautiful vision he has described in ‘ The King 's Quhair , ’ ( see ‘ Specimens . ’ ) This was Lady Jane or Joanna Beaufort , daughter of the Earl of Somerset , niece of Richard II ., and grand-daughter of John of Gaunt , Duke of Lancaster . She was a lady of great beauty and accomplishments as well as of high rank , and James , even before he knew her name , became deeply enamoured . The passion was returned , and their mutual attachment had by and by an important bearing upon his prospects .</p>
     <p>In 1423 , the Duke of Bedford being now the English Regent , the friends of James renewed negotiations — often attempted before in vain — for his return to his native land , where his father had been long dead , and which , torn by factions and steeped in blood , was sorely needing his presence . Commissioners from the two kingdoms met at Pontefract on the 12th of May 1423 , when , in presence of the young King , and with his consent , matters were arranged . The English coolly demanded £ 40 , 000 to defray the expense of James 's nurture and education , ( as though a bill were handed in to a man who had been unjustly detained in prison on a false charge , ere he left its walls ,) insisted on the immediate departure of the Scots from France , where a portion of them were fighting in the French army , and procured the assent of the Scottish Privy Council to the marriage of James with his beloved Jane Beaufort . A truce , too , with Scotland was concluded for seven years . All this was settled ; and soon after , in the Church of St Mary Overies , Southwark , so often alluded to in the ‘ Life of Gower , ’ the happy pair were wed . It seemed a most auspicious event for both countries , and to augur the substitution of permanent peace for casual and temporary truces . To Lady Jane Beaufort it gave a crown , and a noble , gallant , and gifted prince to share it withal . On James it bestowed a lady of great beauty , who was regarded , too , with gratitude as having lightened the load of his captivity , and been a sunshine in his shady place , and — least consideration — who brought him a dowry of £ 10 , 000 , which was , in fact , a remission of the fourth part of his ransom .</p>
     <p>Attended by a magnificent retinue , the royal pair set out for Scotland . They were met at Durham by three hundred of the principal nobility and gentry , twenty-eight of whom were retained by the English as hostages for the national faith . Arrived on his native soil , James , at Melrose Abbey , gave his solemn assent on the Holy Gospels to the treaty ; and seldom have the Eildon Hills returned a louder and more joyous shout of acclamation than now welcomed back to the kingdom of his fathers the ‘ Royal Poet . ’ He proceeded to Edinburgh , where he celebrated Easter with great pomp , and a month later , he and his queen were solemnly crowned inthe Abbey Church at Scone . This was in 1424 . He lived after this only thirteen years ; but the period of his reign has always been thought a glorious interlude in the dark early history of Scotland . He set himself , with considerable success , to curb the exorbitant power of the nobles , sacrificing some of them , such as Albany , to his just indignation . He passed many useful regulations in reference to the coinage , the constitution , and the commerce of the country . He suppressed with a strong hand some of the gangs of robbers and ‘ sorners ’ which abounded , founding instead the order of Bedesmen or King 's Beggars , immortalised since in the character of Edie Ochiltree . He stretched a strong hand over the refractory Highland chieftains . While keeping at first on good terms with the English Court , he turned with a fonder eye to the French as the ancient allies of Scotland , and in 1436 gave his daughter Margaret in marriage to the Dauphin . This step roused the jealousy of his southern neighbours , who tried even to intercept the fleet that was conveying the bride across the Channel , whereupon James , stung to fury , proclaimed war against England , and in August commenced the siege of Roxburgh Castle . The castle , after being environed for fifteen days , was about to fall into his hands , when the Queen suddenly arrived in the camp , and communicated some information , probably referring to a threatened conspiracy of the nobles , which induced him to throw up the siege , disband his army , and return northward in haste . This unexpected step probably retarded , but could not prevent the dreadful purpose of death which had already been formed against the King .</p>
     <p>In October 1436 , he held his last Parliament in Edinburgh , in which , amidst many other enactments , we find , curiously enough , a prefiguration of the Forbes Mackenzie Act , in a decree that all taverns should be shut at nine o'clock . In the end of the year he determined on retiring to Perth , where ( in the language of Gibbon , applied to Timour ) ‘ he was expected by the Angel of Death . ’ It is said that , when about to cross the Frith of Forth , then called the Scottish Sea , a Highland woman , who claimed the character of a prophetess , like Meg Merrilees in fiction , met the cavalcade , and cried out , with a loud voice , ‘ My Lord the King , if you pass this water you shall never return again alive ; ’ but as she was concluded to be mad or drunk , her warning was scorned . He betook himself to the convent of the Black Friars , where Christmas was being celebrated with great pomp and splendour . Meanwhile Robert Grahame , and Walter , Earl of Athole , the King 's own uncle , actuated , the former by revenge on account of the resumption of some lands improperly granted to his family , and the latter by a desire to succeed to the Crown , had formed a plot against James 's life . Several warnings , besides that of the Highland seeress , the King received , but he heeded them not , and , like most of the doomed , was in unnaturally high spirits , as if the winding-sheet far up his breast had been a wedding-robe .</p>
     <p>It is the evening of the 20th of February 1437 . James and his nobles and ladies are seated at table till deep into the night , engaged in chess , music , and song . Athole , like another Judas , has supped with them , and gone out at a late hour . A tremendous knocking is heard at the gate . It is the Highland prophetess , who , having followed the monarch to Perth , is seeking to force her way into the room . The King tells her , through his usher , that he cannot receive her to-night , but will hear her tidings to-morrow . She retires reluctantly , murmuring that they will for ever rue their refusal to admit her into the royal presence . About an hour after this , James calls for the Voidee , or parting-cup , and the company disperse . Sir Robert Stewart , the chamberlain , who is in the confidence of the conspirators , is the last to retire , having previously destroyed the locks and removed the bars of the doors of the royal bed - chamber and the outer room adjoining . The King is standing before the fire , in his night-gown and slippers , and talking gaily with the Queen and her ladies , when torches are seen flashing up from the garden , and the clash of arms and the sound of angry voices is heard from below . A sense of the dread reality bursts on them in an instant . The Queen and the ladies run to secure the door of the chamber , while James , seizing the tongs , wrenches up one of the boards of the floor and takes refuge in a vault beneath . This was wont to have an opening to the outer court , but it had unfortunately been built up of late by his own orders . There , under the replaced boards , cowers the King , while the Queen and her women seek to barricade the door . One brave young lady , Catherine Douglas , thrusts her beautiful arm into the staple from which the bolt had been removed . It is broken in a moment , and she sinks back , to bear , with her descendants — a family well known in Scotland — the name of Barlass ever since . The murderers , who had previously killed in the passage one Walter Straiton , a page , rush in , with naked swords , wounding the ladies , striking , and well-nigh killing the Queen , and crying , with frantic imprecations , ‘ This is but a woman ! Where is James ? ’ Finding him not in the chamber , they leave it , and disperse through the neighbouring apartments in search .</p>
     <p>James , who had become wearied of his immurement , and thought the assassins were gone , calls now on one of the ladies to aid him in coming out of his place of concealment . But while this is being effected , one of the murderers returns . The cry , ‘ Found , found , ’ rings through the halls ; and after a violent but unarmed resistance , the King is , with circumstances of horrible barbarity , first mangled , then run through the body , and then despatched with daggers . In vain he offers half his kingdom for his life ; and when he seeks a confessor from Grahame , the ruffian replies , ‘ Thou shalt have no confessor but this sword . ’ It is satisfactory to know that the Queen made her escape , and that the criminals were punished , although the tortures they endured are such as human nature shrinks from conceiving , and history with a shudder records .</p>
     <p>We turn with pleasure from King James 's life and death to his poetry , although there is so little of it that a sentence or two will suffice . ‘ The King 's Quhair ’ is a poem conceived very much in the spirit , and written in the style of Chaucer , whose works were favourites with James . There is the same sympathy with nature , and the same perception of its relation to and unconscious sympathy with human feelings , and the same luscious richness in the description , alike of the early beauties of spring and of youthful feminine loveliness , although this seems more natural in the young poet James than in the sexagenarian author of ‘ The Canterbury Tales . ’ There is nothing even in Chaucer we think finer than the picture of Lady Jane Beaufort in the garden , particularly in the lines —</p>

     <p>Besides this precious little poem , King James is believed by some to have written several poems on Scottish subjects , such as ‘ Christis Kirk on the Green , ’ ‘ Peblis to the Play , ’ &amp; c ., but his claim to these is uncertain . The first describes the mingled merrymaking and contest common in the old rude marriages of Scotland , and , whether by James or not , is full of burly , picturesque force .</p>

     <p>Our readers will perceive the resemblance , both in spirit and in form of verse , between this old poem and the ‘ Holy Fair , ’ and other productions of Burns .</p>
     <p>James , cut off in the prime of life , may almost be called the abortive Alfred of Scotland . Had he lived , he might have made important contributions to her literature as well as laws , and given her a standing among the nations of Europe , which it took long ages , and even an incorporation with England , to secure . As it is , he stands high on the list of royal authors , and of those kings who , whether authors or not , have felt that nations cannot live on bread alone , and who have sought their intellectual culture as an object not inferior to their physical comfort . It is not , perhaps , too much to say , that no man or woman of genius has sate either on the Scotch or English throne since , except Cromwell , to whom , however , the term ‘ genius , ’ in its common sense , seems ludicrously inadequate . James V. had some of the erratic qualities of the poetic tribe , but his claim to the songs — such as the ‘ Gaberlunzie Man ’ — which go under his name , is exceedingly doubtful . James VI . was a pedant , without being a scholar — a rhymester , not a poet . Of the rest we need not speak . Seldom has the sceptre become an Aaron 's rod , and flourished with the buds and blossoms of song . In our annals there has been one , and but one ‘ Royal Poet . ’</p>

     <p>JOHN THE CHAPLAIN — THOMAS OCCLEVE .</p>
     <p>The first of these is the only versifier that can be assigned to England in the reign of Henry IV . His name was John Walton , though he was generally known as Johannes Capellanus or ‘ John the Chaplain . ’ He was canon of Oseney , and died sub-dean of York . He , in the year 1410 , translated Boethius ’ famous treatise , ‘ De Consolatione Philosophiae , ’ into English verse . He is not known to have written anything original . — Thomas Occleve appeared in the reign of Henry V ., about 1420 . Like Chaucer and Gower , he was a student of municipal law , having attended Chester 's Inn , which stood on the site of the present Somerset House ; but although he trod in the footsteps of his celebrated predecessors , it was with far feebler powers . His original pieces are contemptible , both in subject and in execution . His best production is a translation of ‘ Egidius De Regimine Principum . ’ Warton , alluding to the period at which these writers appeared , has the following oft-quoted observations : — ‘ I consider Chaucer as a genial day in an English spring . A brilliant sun enlivens the face of nature with an unusual lustre ; the sudden appearance of cloudless skies , and the unexpected warmth of a tepid atmosphere , after the gloom and the inclemencies of a tedious winter , fill our hearts with the visionary prospect of a speedy summer , and we fondly anticipate a long continuance of gentle gales and vernal serenity . But winter returns with redoubled horrors ; the clouds condense more formidably than before , and those tender buds and early blossoms which were called forth by the transient gleam of a temporary sunshine , are nipped by frosts and torn by tempests . ’ These sentences are , after all , rather pompous , and express , in the most verbose style of the Rambler , the simple fact , that after Chaucer 's death the ground lay fallow , and that for a while in England ( in Scotland it was otherwise ) there were few poets , and little poetry .</p>
     <lg type="poem">
      <head>JOHN LYDGATE .</head>
      <head>This copious and versatile writer flourished in the reign of Henry VI . Warton affirms that he reached his highest point of eminence in 1430 , although some of his poems had appeared before . He was a monk of the Benedictine Abbey at Bury , in Suffolk . He received his education at Oxford ; and when it was finished , he travelled through France and Italy , mastering the languages and literature of both countries , and studying their poets , particularly Dante , Boccaccio , and Alain Chartier . When he returned , he opened a school in his monastery for teaching the sons of the nobility composition and the art of versification . His acquirements were , for the age , universal . He was a poet , a rhetorician , an astronomer , a mathematician , a public disputant , and a theologian . He was born in 1370 , ordained sub-deacon in 1389 , deacon in 1393 , and priest in 1397 . The time of his death is uncertain . His great patron was Humphrey , Duke of Gloucester , to whom he complains sometimes of necessitous circumstances , which were , perhaps , produced by indulgence , since he confesses himself to be ‘ a lover of wine . ’</head>
       <l n="1">The great merit of Lydgate is his versatility . This Warton has happily</l>
       <l n="2">expressed in a few sentences , which we shall quote :—</l>
     </lg>
     <p>‘ He moves with equal ease in every form of composition . His hymns and his ballads have the same degree of merit ; and whether his subject be the life of a hermit or a hero , of Saint Austin or Guy , Earl of Warwick , ludicrous or legendary , religious or romantic , a history or an allegory , he writes with facility . His transitions were rapid , from works of the most serious and laborious kind , to sallies of levity and pieces of popular entertainment . His muse was of universal access ; and he was not only the poet of his monastery , but of the world in general . If a disguising was intended by the Company of Goldsmiths , a mask before His Majesty at Eltham , a May game for the sheriffs and aldermen of London , a mumming before the Lord Mayor , a procession of pageants , from the “ Creation , ” for the Festival of Corpus Christi , or a carol for the coronation , Lydgate was consulted , and gave the poetry . ’</p>
     <p>Lydgate is , so far as we know , the first British bard who wrote for hire . At the request of Whethamstede , the Abbot of St Alban 's , he translated a ‘ Life of St Alban ’ from Latin into English rhymes , and received for the whole work one hundred shillings . His principal poems , all founded on the works of other authors , are the ‘ Fall of Princes , ’ the ‘ Siege of Thebes , ’ and the ‘ Destruction of Troy . ’ They are written in a diffuse and verbose style , but are generally clear in sense , and often very luxuriant in description . ‘ The London Lyckpenny ’ is a fugitive poem , in which the author describes himself coming up to town in search of legal redress for a wrong , and gives some curious particulars of the condition of that city in the early part of the fifteenth century .</p>

       <l n="1">HARDING , KAY , &amp; c .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>John Harding flourished about the year 1403 . He fought at the battle of Shrewsbury on the Percy side . He is the author of a poem entitled ‘ The Chronicle of England unto the Reign of King Edward the Fourth , in Verse . ’ It has no poetic merit , and little interest , except to the antiquary . In the reign of the above king we find the first mention of a Poet Laureate . John Kay was appointed by Edward , when he returned from Italy , Poet Laureate to the king , but has , perhaps fortunately for the world , left behind him no poems . Would that the same had been the case with some of his successors in the office ! There is reason to believe , that for nearly two centuries ere this date , there had existed in the court a personage , entitled the King 's Versifier , ( versificator ,) to whom one hundred shillings a-year was the salary , and that the title was , by and by , changed to that of Poet Laureate , i. e ., Laurelled Poet . It had long been customary in the universities to crown scholars when they graduated with laurel , and Warton thinks that from these the first poet laureates were selected , less for their general genius than for their skill in Latin verse . Certainly the earliest of the Laureate poems , such as those by Baston and Gulielmus , who acted as royal poets to Richard I. and Edward II ., and wrote , the one on Richard 's Crusade , and the other on Edward 's Siege of Stirling Castle , are in Latin . So too are the productions of Andrew Bernard , who was the Poet Laureate successively to Henry VII . and Henry VIII . It was not till after the Reformation had lessened the superstitious veneration for the Latin tongue that the laureates began to write in English . It is almost a pity , we are sometimes disposed to think , that , in reference to such odes as those of Pye , Whitehead , Colley Cibber , and even some of Southey 's , the old practice had not continued ; since thus , in the first place , we might have had a chance of elegant Latinity , in the absence of poetry and sense ; and since , secondly , the deficiencies of the laureate poems would have been disguised , from the general eye at least , under the veil of an unknown tongue . It is curious to notice about this period the uprise of two didactic poets , both writing on alchymy , the chemistry of that day , and neither displaying a spark of genius . These are John Norton and George Ripley , both renowned for learning and knowledge of their beloved occult sciences . Their poems , that by Norton , entitled ‘ The Ordinal , ’ and that by Ripley , entitled ‘ The Compound of Alchemie , ’ are dry and rugged treatises , done into indifferent verse . One rather fine fancy occurs in the first of these . It is that of an alchymist who projected a bridge of gold over the Thames , near London , crowned with pinnacles of gold , which , being studded with carbuncles , should diffuse a blaze of light in the dark ! Alchymy has had other and nobler singers than Ripley and Norton . It has , as Warton remarks , ‘ enriched the store - house of Arabian romance with many magnificent imageries . ’ It is the inspiration of two of the noblest romances in this or any language — ‘ St. Leon ’ and ‘ Zanoni . ’ And its idea , transfigured into a transcen - dental form , gave light and life and fire , and the loftiest poetry , to the eloquence of the lamented Samuel Brown , whose tongue , as he talked on his favourite theme , seemed transmuted into gold ; nay , whose lips , like the touch of Midas , seemed to create the effects of alchymy upon every subject they approached , and upon every heart over which they wielded their sorcery .</p>
     <p>We pass now from this comparatively barren age in the history of English poetry to a cluster of Scottish bards . The first of these is ROBERT HENRYSON . He was schoolmaster at Dunfermline , and died some time before 1508 . He is supposed by Lord Hailes to have been preceptor of youth in the Benedictine convent in that place . He is the author of ‘ Robene and Makyne , ’ a pastoral ballad of very considerable merit , and of which Campbell says , somewhat too warmly , ‘ It is the first known pastoral , ’ ( he means in the Scottish language of course ,) ‘ and one of the best , in a dialect rich with the favours of the pastoral muse . ’ He wrote also a sequel to Chaucer 's ‘ Troilus and Cresseide ’ entitled ‘ The Testament of Cresseide , ’ and thirteen Fables , of which copies , in MS ., are preserved in the Advocates ’ Library , Edinburgh . One of these , ‘ The Town and Country Mouse , ’ tells that old story with considerable spirit and humour . ‘ The Garment of Good Ladies ’ is an ingenious and beautiful strain , written in that quaint style of allegorising which continued popular as far down as the days of Cowley , and even later .</p>

      <head>WILLIAM DUNBAR</head>
      <head>This was a man of the true and sovereign seed of genius . Sir Walter Scott calls Dunbar ‘ a poet unrivalled by any — that Scotland has ever produced . ’ We venture to call him the Dante of Scotland ; nay , we question if any English poet has surpassed ‘ The Dance of the Seven Deadly Sins through Hell ’ in its peculiarly Dantesque qualities of severe and purged grandeur ; of deep sincerity , and in that air of moral disappointment and sorrow , approaching despair , which distinguished the sad-hearted lover of Beatrice , who might almost have exclaimed , with one yet mightier than he in his misery and more miserable in his might ,</head>
       <l n="1">‘ Where'er I am is Hell — myself am Hell . ’</l>
     </lg>
     <p>Foster , in an entry in his journal , ( we quote from memory ,) says , ‘ I have just seen the moon rising , and wish the impression to be eternal . What a look she casts upon earth , like that of a celestial being who loves our planet still , but has given up all hope of ever doing her any good or seeing her become any better — so serene she seems in her settled and unutterable sadness . ’ Such , we have often fancied , was the feeling of the great Florentine toward the world , and which — pained , pitying , yearning enthusiast that he was !— escaped irresistibly from those deep - set eyes , that adamantine jaw , and that brow , wearing the laurel , proudly yet painfully , as if it were a crown of everlasting fire ! Dunbar was not altogether a Dante , either in melancholy or in power , but his ‘ Dance ’ reveals kindred moods , operating at times on a kindred genius .</p>
     <p>In Dante humour existed too , but ere it could come up from his deep nature to the surface , it must freeze and stiffen into monumental scorn — a laughter that seemed , while mocking at all things else , to mock at its own mockery most of all . Aird speaks in his ‘ Demoniac , ’ of a smile upon his hero 's brow ,</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">‘ Like the lightning of a hope about to DIE</l>
       <l n="2">For ever from the furrow 'd brows of Hell 's Eternity . ’</l>
     </lg>
     <p>Dante 's smile may rather be compared to the RISING of a false and self - detected hope upon the lost brows where it is never to come to dawn , and where , nevertheless , it remains for ever , like a smile carved upon a sepulchre . Dunbar has a more joyous disposition than his Italian prototype and master , and he indulges himself to the top of his bent , but in a style ( particularly in his ‘ Twa Married Women and the Widow , ’ and in ‘ The Friars of Berwick , ’ which is not , however , quite certainly his ) too coarse and prurient for the taste of this age .</p>
     <p>‘ The Merle and the Nightingale ’ is one of the finest of Moelibean poems . Beautiful is the contest between the two sweet singers as to whether the love of man or the love of God be the nobler , and more beautiful still their reconciliation , when</p>
     <lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">‘ Then sang they both with voices loud and clear ,</l>
       <l n="2">The Merle sang , “ Man , love God that has thee wrought . ”</l>
       <l n="3">The Nightingale sang , “ Man , love the Lord most dear ,</l>
       <l n="4">That thee and all this world made of nought . ”</l>
       <l n="5">The Merle said , “ Love him that thy love has sought</l>
       <l n="6">From heaven to earth , and here took flesh and bone . ”</l>
       <l n="7">The Nightingale sang . “ And with his death thee bought :</l>
       <l n="8">All love is lost , but upon him alone . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="9">‘ Then flew these birds over the boughis sheen ,</l>
       <l n="10">Singing of love among the leaves small . ’</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>William Dunbar is said to have been born about the year 1465 . He received his education at St Andrews , and took there the degree of M. A . in 1479 . He became then a friar of the Franciscan order , ( Grey Friars ,) and in the exercise of his profession seems to have rambled over all Scotland , England , and France , preaching , begging , and , according to his own confession , cheating , lying , and cajoling . Yet if this kind of life was not propitious , in his case , to morality , it must have been to the development of the poetic faculty . It enabled him to see all varieties of life and of scenery , although here and there , in his verses , you find symptoms of that bitterness which is apt to arise in the heart of a wanderer . He was subsequently employed by James IV . in some official work connected with various foreign embassies , which led him to Spain , Italy , and Germany , as well as England and France . This proves that he was no less a man of business-capacity and habits than a poet . For these services he , in 1500 , received from the King a pension of ten pounds , afterwards increased to twenty , and , in fine , to eighty . He is said to have been employed in the negotiations preparatory to the marriage of James with Margaret Tudor , daughter of Henry VII ., which took place in 1503 , and which our poet celebrated in his verses , ‘ The Thistle and the Rose . ’ He continued ever afterwards in the Court , hovering in position between a laureate and a court-fool , charming James with his witty conversation as well as his verses , but refused the benefices for which he petitioned , and gradually devoured by chagrin and disappointment . Seldom has genius so great been placed in a falser position , and this has given a querulous tinge to many of his poems . He seems to have died about 1520 . Even after his death , misfortune pursued him . His works were , with the exception of two or three pieces , locked up in an obscure MS. till the middle of last century . Since then , however , their fame has been still increasing . In 1834 , Mr David Laing , so favourably known as one of our first antiquarians , published a complete and elaborate edition of Dunbar 's works ; and in a newspaper this very day ( May 23 ) we see another edition announced , in a popular and modernised shape , of the poetry of this great old Scottish Makkar .</p>

      <head>GAVIN DOUGLAS .</head>
      <head>This eminent prelate was a younger son of Archibald , the fifth Earl of Angus . He was born in Brechin about the year 1474 . He studied at the University of Paris . He became a churchman , and yet united with attention to the duties of his calling great proficiency in polite learning . In 1513 he finished a translation , into Scottish verse , of Virgil 's ‘ Aeneid , ’ which , considering the age , is an extraordinary performance . It occupied him only sixteen months . The multitude of obsolete terms , however , in which it abounds , renders it now , as a whole , illegible . After passing through various subordinate offices , such as the ‘ Provostship ’ of St Giles 's , Edinburgh , and the ‘ Abbotship ’ of Arbroath , he was at length appointed Bishop of Dunkeld . Dunkeld was not then the paradise it has become , but Birnam hill and the other mountains then , as now , stood round about it , the old Cathedral rose up in mediaeval majesty , and the broad , smooth Tay flowed onward to the ocean . And , doubtless , Douglas felt the poetic inspiration from it quite as warmly as did Thomas Brown , when , three centuries afterwards , he set up the staff of his summer rest at the beautiful Invar inn , and thence delighted to diverge to the hundred scenes of enchantment which stretch around . The good Bishop was an ardent politician as well as a poet , and was driven , by his share in the troubles of the times , to flee from his native land , and take refuge in the Court of Henry VIII . The King received him kindly , and treated him with much liberality . In 1522 he died at London of the plague , and was interred in the Savoy Church . He was , according to Buchanan , about to proceed to Rome to vindicate himself before the Pope against certain charges brought by his enemies . Besides the translation of the ‘ Aeneid , ’ Douglas is the author of a long poem entitled the ‘ Palace of Honour ; ’ it is an allegory , describing a large company making a pilgrimage to Honour 's Palace . It bears considerable resemblance to the ‘ Pilgrim 's Progress , ’ and some suppose that Bunyan had seen it before composing his allegory . ‘ King Hart ’ is another production of our poet 's , of considerable length and merit . It gives , metaphorically , a view of human life . Perhaps his best pieces are his ‘ Prologues , ’ affixed to each book of the ‘ Aeneid . ’ From them we have selected ‘ Morning in May ’ as a specimen . The closing lines are fine .</head>
       <l n="1">‘ Welcome the lord of light , and lamp of day ,</l>
       <l n="2">Welcome fosterer of tender herbis green ,</l>
       <l n="3">Welcome quickener of flourish 'd flowers sheen ,</l>
       <l n="4">Welcome support of every root and vein ,</l>
       <l n="5">Welcome comfort of all kind fruit and grain , ’ &amp; c .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>Douglas must not be named with Dunbar in strength and grandeur of genius . His power is more in expression than in conception , and hence he has shone so much in translation . His version of the ‘ Aeneid ’ is the first made of any classic into a British tongue , and is the worthy progenitor of such minor miracles of poetical talent — all somewhat more mechanical than inspired , and yet giving a real , though subordinate glory to our literature-as Fairfax 's ‘ Tasso , ’ Dryden 's ‘ Virgil , ’ and Pope 's , Coper 's , and Sotheby 's ‘ Homer . ’ The fire in Douglas ’ original verses is occasionally lost in smoke , and the meaning buried in flowery verbiage . Still he was an honour alike to the Episcopal bench and the Muse of Scotland . He was of amiable manners , gentle temperament , and a noble and commanding appearance .</p>

       <l n="1">HAWES , BARCLAY , &amp; c .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>Stephen Hawes , a native of Suffolk , wrote about the close of the fifteenth century . He studied at Oxford , and travelled much in France , where he became a master of French and Italian poetry . King Henry VII ., struck with his conversation and the readiness with which he repeated old English poets , especially Lydgate , created him groom of the privy chamber . Hawes has written a number of poems , such as ‘ The Temple of Glasse , ’ ‘ The Conversion of Swearers , ’ ‘ The Consolation of Lovers , ’ ‘ The Pastime of Pleasure , ’ &amp; c. Those who wish to see specimens of the strange allegories and curious devices of thought in which it abounds , may find them in Warton 's ‘ History of English Poetry . ’</p>
     <p>In that same valuable work we find an account of Alexander Barclay , author of ‘ The Ship of Fools . ’ He was educated at Oriel College in Oxford , and after travelling abroad , was appointed one of the priests or prebendaries of the College of St Mary Ottery , in Devonshire — a parish famous in later days for the birth of Coleridge . Barclay became afterwards a Benedictine monk of Ely monastery ; and at length a brother of the Order of St Francis , at Canterbury . He died , a very old man , at Croydon , in Surrey , in the year 1552 . His principal work , ‘ The Ship of Fools , ’ is a satire upon the vices and absurdities of his age , and shews considerable wit and power of sarcasm .</p>
     <p>SKELTON .</p>
     <p>John Skelton is the name of the next poet . He flourished in the earlier part of the reign of Henry VIII . Having studied both at Oxford and Cambridge , and been laureated at the former university in 1489 , he was promoted to the rectory of Diss or Dysse , in Norfolk . Some say he had acted previously as tutor to Henry VIII . At Dysse he attracted attention by satirical ballads against the mendicants , as well as by licences of buffoonery in the pulpit . For these he was censured , and even , it is said , suspended , by Nykke , Bishop of Norwich . Undaunted by this , he flew at higher game — ventured to ridicule Cardinal Wolsey , then in his power , and had to take refuge from the myrmidons of the prelate in Westminster Abbey . There Abbot Islip kindly entertained and protected him till his dying day . He breathed his last in the year 1529 , and was buried in the adjacent church of St Margaret 's .</p>
     <p>Skelton as well as Barclay enjoyed considerable popularity in his own age . Erasmus calls him ‘ Britannicarum literarum lumen et decus ! ’ How dark must have been the night in which such a Will-o ’ - wisp was mistaken for a star ! He has wit , indeed , and satirical observation ; but his wit is wilder than it is strong , and his satire is dashed with personality and obscenity . His style , Campbell observes , is ‘ almost a texture of slang phrases , patched with shreds of French and Latin . ’ His verses on Margaret Hussey , which we have quoted , are in his happiest vein . The following lines , too , on Cardinal Wolsey , are as true as they are terse :—</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">‘ Then in the Chamber of Stars</l>
       <l n="2">All matter there he mars .</l>
       <l n="3">Clapping his rod on the board ,</l>
       <l n="4">No man dare speak a word .</l>
       <l n="5">For he hath all the saying ,</l>
       <l n="6">Without any renaying .</l>
       <l n="7">He rolleth in his recòrds ;</l>
       <l n="8">He sayeth , How say ye , my Lords ?</l>
       <l n="9">Is not my reason good ?</l>
       <l n="10">Good even , good Robin Hood .</l>
       <l n="11">Some say , Yes ; and some</l>
       <l n="12">Sit still , as they were dumb . ’</l>
     </lg>
     <p>It is curious that Wolsey 's enemies , in one of their charges against him in the Parliament of 1529 , have repeated , almost in the words of Skelton , the same accusation .</p>

      <head>SIR DAVID LYNDSAY .</head>
      <head>Returning to Scotland , we find a Skelton of a higher order and a brawnier make in Sir David Lyndsay , or , as our forefathers were wont familiarly to denominate him , ‘ Davie Lyndsay . ’ Lyndsay was descended from a noble family , a younger branch of Lyndsay of the Byres , and born in 1490 , probably at the Mount , the family-seat , near Cupar-Fife . He entered the University of St Andrews in the year 1505 , and four years later left it to travel in Italy . He must , however , have returned to Scotland before the 12th of October 1511 , since we learn from the records of the Lord Treasurer that he was presented with a quantity of ‘ blue and yellow taffety to be a playcoat for the play performed in the King and Queen 's presence in the Abbey of Holyrood . ’ On the 12th of April 1512 , Lyndsay , then twenty-two years of age , was appointed gentleman-usher to James V ., who had been born that very day . In his poem called ‘ The Dream , ’ he reminds the King of his having borne him in his arms ere he could walk ; of having wrapped him up warmly in his little bed ; of having sung to him with his lute , danced before him to make him laugh , and having carried him on his shoulders like a ‘ pedlar his pack . ’ He continued to be page and companion to the King till 1524 , when , in consequence of the unprincipled machinations of the Queen - mother — who was acting as Regent — he , as well as Bellenden , the learned translator of Livy and Boece , was ejected from his office . When , however , in 1528 , the young King , by a noble effort , emancipated himself from the thraldom of his mother and the Douglasses , Lyndsay wrote his ‘ Dream , ’ in which , amidst much poetic or fantastic matter , he congratulates James on his deliverance ; reminds him , as aforesaid , of his early services ; and takes occasion to paint the evils the country had endured during his minority , and to give him some bold and salutary advice as to his future conduct . The next year ( 1529 ) he produced ‘ The Complaint , ’ a poem in which he recurs to former themes , and remonstrates with great freedom and severity against the treatment he had undergone . Here , too , the religious reformer peeps out . He exhorts the King to compel the clergy to attend to the duties of their office ; to preach more earnestly ; to administer the sacraments according to the institution of Christ ; and not to deceive their people with superstitious pilgrimages , vain traditions , and prayers to graven images , contrary to the written command of God . He with quaint iron says , that if his Grace will lend him</head>
       <l n="1">‘ Of gold ane thousand pound or tway , ’</l>
     </lg>
     <p>he will give him a sealed bond , obliging himself to repay the loan when the Bass and the Isle of May are set upon Mount Sinai ; or the Lomond hills , near Falkland , are removed to Northumberland ; or</p>
     <lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">‘ When kirkmen yairnis [ desire ] na dignity ,</l>
       <l n="2">Nor wives na soveranitie . ’</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="3">Still finer the last lines of the poem . ‘ If not , ’ he says , ‘ my God</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="4">‘ Shall cause me stand content</l>
       <l n="5">With quiet life and sober rent ,</l>
       <l n="6">And take me , in my latter age ,</l>
       <l n="7">Unto my simple hermitage ,</l>
       <l n="8">To spend the gear my elders won ,</l>
       <l n="9">As did Diogenes in his tun . ’</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>This ‘ Complaint ’ proved successful , and in the next year ( 1530 ) Lyndsay was appointed Lion King-at-Arms — an office of great dignity in these days . The Lion was the chief judge of all matters connected with heraldry in the realm ; was also the official ambassador from his sovereign to foreign countries ; and was inaugurated in his office with a pomp and circumstance little inferior to those of a royal coronation , the King crowning him with his own hands , anointing him with wine instead of oil , and putting on his head the Royal Crown of Scotland , which he continued to wear till the close of the feast . It is of Lyndsay in the full accoutrements of this office that Sir Walter Scott speaks in his ‘ Marmion , ’ although he antedates by sixteen years the time when he assumed it :—</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">‘ He was a man of middle age ,</l>
       <l n="2">In aspect manly , grave , and sage ,</l>
       <l n="3">As on king 's errand come ;</l>
       <l n="4">But in the glances of his eye ,</l>
       <l n="5">A penetrating , keen , and sly</l>
       <l n="6">Expression found its home —</l>
       <l n="7">The flash of that satiric rage</l>
       <l n="8">Which , bursting on the early stage ,</l>
       <l n="9">Branded the vices of the age ,</l>
       <l n="10">And broke the keys of Rome .</l>
       <l n="11">On milk-white palfrey forth he paced ;</l>
       <l n="12">His cap of maintenance was graced</l>
       <l n="13">With the proud heron-plume ;</l>
       <l n="14">From his steed 's shoulder , loin , and breast</l>
       <l n="15">Silk housings swept the ground ,</l>
       <l n="16">With Scotland 's arms , device , and crest</l>
       <l n="17">Embroider 'd round and round .</l>
       <l n="18">The double treasure might you see ,</l>
       <l n="19">First by Achaius borne ,</l>
       <l n="20">The thistle and the fleur-de-lis ,</l>
       <l n="21">And gallant unicorn .</l>
       <l n="22">So bright the king 's armorial coat ,</l>
       <l n="23">That scarce the dazzled eye could note ;</l>
       <l n="24">In living colours , blazon 'd brave ,</l>
       <l n="25">The lion , which his title gave .</l>
       <l n="26">A train which well beseem 'd his state ,</l>
       <l n="27">But all unarm 'd , around him wait ;</l>
       <l n="28">Still is thy name in high account ,</l>
       <l n="29">And still thy verse has charms ,</l>
       <l n="30">Sir David Lyndsay of the Mount ,</l>
       <l n="31">Lord Lion King-at-Arms . ’</l>
     </lg>
     <p>Soon after this appointment , Lyndsay wrote ‘ The Complaint of the King 's Papingo , ’ in which , through the mouth of a dying parrot , he gives some sharp counsel to the king , his courtiers and nobles , and administers severe satirical chastisement to the corruptions of the clergy . It is an exceedingly clever production , and has some beautiful poetry as well as stinging sarcasm . Take the following address to Edinburgh , Stirling , Linlithgow , and Falkland :—</p>

       <l n="20">In the year 1535 , Lyndsay wrote his remarkable drama , ‘ The Satire of the</l>
       <l n="21">Three Estates ’ — Monarch , namely , Barons , and Clergy . It is made up in</l>
       <l n="22">nearly three equal parts of ingenuity , wit , and grossness . It is a drama ,</l>
       <l n="23">and was acted several times — first , in 1535 , at Cupar-Fife , on a large</l>
       <l n="24">green mound called Moot-hill ; then , in 1539 , in an open park near</l>
       <l n="25">Linlithgow , by the express desire of the king , who with all the ladies</l>
       <l n="26">of the Court attended the representation ; then in the amphitheatre of</l>
       <l n="27">St Johnston in Perth ; and in 1554 , at Edinburgh , in the village of</l>
       <l n="28">Greenside , which skirted the northern base of the Calton Hill , in the</l>
       <l n="29">presence of the Queen Regent and an enormous concourse of spectators .</l>
       <l n="30">Its exhibition appears to have occupied nearly the whole day . In the</l>
       <l n="31">‘ Pictorial History of Scotland , ’ chapter xxiv ., our readers will find a</l>
       <l n="32">full and able analysis with extracts of this extraordinary performance .</l>
       <l n="33">It is said to have done much good in opening the eyes of the people to</l>
       <l n="34">the evils of the Papacy , and in paving the way for the Reformation .</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>In 1536 Sir David , in company with Sir John Campbell of Lundie , was sent to the Court of France to demand in marriage for James V. a daughter of the House of Vendome ; but the King chose rather to take the matter in his own hands , and , going over in person , wedded Magdalene , daughter of Francis . She died two months after her arrival in Scotland , universally regretted ; and Lyndsay made the sad event the subject of a poem , entitled ‘ Deploration of the Death of Queen Magdalene , ’ whom he designates</p>
     <p>‘ The flower of France , and comfort of Scotland . ’</p>
     <p>When James subsequently married Mary of Guise , Sir David 's ingenuity was strained to the utmost in providing pageants , masques , and shows to welcome her Majesty . For forty days in St Andrews , festivities continued ; and it was during this prolonged festival that the Lion King , as if sick and satiated with vanities , wrote two poems , one entitled ‘ The Justing between James Watson and John Barbour , ’ a dull satire on tournaments , &amp; c ., and the other a somewhat cleverer piece , entitled ‘ Supplication directed to the King 's Grace in Contemptioun of Side Tails , ’ the long trains then worn by the ladies . It met , we presume , with the fate of Punch 's sarcasms against crinoline ,— the ‘ phylacteries ’ would for a season , instead of being lessened , be enlarged , till Fashion lifted up her omnipotent rod , and told it to be otherwise .</p>
     <p>King James died prematurely on the 14th of December 1542 , and Lyndsay closed his eyes at Falkland , and mourned for him as a brother . From that day forth he probably felt that there was ‘ less sunshine in the sky for him . ’ In the troublous times which succeeded this , he had to retire for a season from the Court , having become obnoxious to the rigid Papists on account of his writings . After the death of Cardinal Beatoun he wrote the tragedy of ‘ The Cardinal , ’ a poem in which the spectre of the Cardinal is the spokesman , and which teems with good advice to all and sundry . The execution , however , is not so felicitous as the plan . In 1548 Lyndsay went to Denmark to negotiate a free trade with Scotland . On his return in 1550 he wrote his very pleasing and chivalric ‘ History of Squire Meldrum , ’ founded on the actual adventures of William Meldrum , the Laird of Cleish and Binns , a distinguished friend of the poet , who had gained laurels as a warrior both in Scotland and in France . This poem is , in a measure , an anticipation of the rhymed romances of Scott , and is full of picturesque description and spirit-stirring adventure . In 1553 he completed his last and most elaborate work , which had occupied him for years , entitled ‘ The Monarchic , ’ containing an account of the most famous monarchies which have existed on earth , and carrying on the history to the general judgment . From this date we almost entirely lose sight of our poet . He seems to have retired into private life , and is supposed to have died about the close of 1557 . He was probably buried in the family vault at Ceres , but no stone marks the spot . Dying without issue , his estates passed to his brother Alexander , and were continued in the possession of his descendants till the middle of last century . They now belong to the Hopes of Rankeillour . The office of Lord Lion was held by two of the poet 's relatives successively — Sir David , his nephew , who became Lion King in 1591 , and his son-in-law , Sir Jerome Lyndsay , who succeeded to it in 1621 .</p>
     <p>Sir David Lyndsay , unlike most satirists , was a good , a blameless , and a religious man . The occasional loftiness of his poetic vein , the breadth of his humour , the purity of his purpose , and his strong reforming zeal combined to make his poetry exceedingly popular in Scotland for a number of ages , particularly among the lower orders . Scott introduces Andrew Fairservice , in ‘ Rob Roy , ’ saying , in reference to Francis Osbaldistone 's poetical efforts , ‘ Gude help him ! twa lines o ’ Davie Lyndsay wad ding a ’ he ever clerkit , ’ and even still there are districts of the country where his name is a household word .</p>

     <p>THOMAS TUSSER .</p>
     <p>Of Tusser we know only that he was horn in the year 1523 , was well educated , commenced life as a courtier under the patronage of Lord Paget , but became a farmer , pursuing agriculture at Ratwood in Sussex , Ipswich , Fairsted in Essex , Norwich , and other places ; that he was not successful , and had to betake himself to other occupations , such as those of a chorister , fiddler , &amp; c .; and that , finally , he died a poor man in London in the year 1580 . Tusser has left only one work , published in 1557 , entitled ‘ A Hundred Good Points of Husbandrie , ’ written in simple but sometimes strong verse .

     <p>In Tottell 's ‘ Miscellany , ’ the first of the sort in the English language , published in 1557 , although the names of many of the authors are not given , the following writers are understood to have contributed :— Sir Francis Bryan , a friend of Wyatt 's , one of the principal ornaments of the Court of Henry VIII ., and who died , in 1548 , Chief Justiciary of Ireland ; George Boleyn , Earl of Rochford , the amiable brother of the famous Anne Boleyn , and who fell a victim to the insane jealousy of Henry , being beheaded in 1536 ; and Lord Thomas Vaux , son of Nicholas Vaux , who died in the latter end of Queen Mary 's reign . In the same Miscellany is found ‘ Phillide and Harpalus , ’ the ‘ first true pastoral , ’ says Warton , ‘ in the English language , ’ ( see ‘ Specimens . ’ ) To it are annexed , too , a collection of ‘ Songes , written by N. G ., ’ which means Nicholas Grimoald , an Oxford man , renowned for his rhetorical lectures in Christ Church , and for being , after Surrey , our first writer of blank verse , in the modulation of which he excelled even Surrey . Henry himself , who was an expert musician , is said also to have composed a book of sonnets and one madrigal in praise of Anne Boleyn . In the same reign occur the names of Borde , Bale , Bryan , Annesley , John Rastell , Wilfred Holme , and Charles Bansley , all writers of minor and forgotten poems . John Heywood , called the Epigrammatist , was of a somewhat higher order . He was the favourite of Sir Thomas More and the pensioner of Henry VIII . He gained favour partly through his conversational humour , and partly through his writings . He is the author of various comedies ; of six hundred epigrams , most of them very poor ; of a dialogue , in verse , containing all the proverbs then afloat in the language ; of an apologue , entitled ‘ The Spider and the Fly , ’ &amp; c. Heywood , who was a rigid Papist , left the kingdom after the decease of Queen Mary , and died at Mechlin , in Brabant , in 1565 . Warton has preserved some specimens of Sir Thomas More 's poetry , which do not add much to our conception of his genius . In 1542 , one Robert Vaughan wrote an alliterative poem , entitled ‘ The Falcon and the Pie . ’ In 1521 , ‘ The Not-browne Maid , ’ ( given by us in ‘ Percy 's Reliques , ’ ) appeared in a curious collection , called ‘ Arnolde 's Chronicle , or Customs of London . ’ In the same year Wynkyn de Worde printed a set of ‘ Christmas Carols , ’ and in 1529 ‘ A Treatise of Merlin , or his Prophecies in Verse . ’ In Henry 's days , too , there commences the long line of translators of the Psalms into English metre , commencing with Thomas Sternhold , groom of the robes to the King , who versified fifty-one psalms , which were published in 1549 , and with John Hopkins , a clergyman and schoolmaster in Suffolk , who added fifty-eight more , and progressing with Whyttingham , Thomas Norton , ( the joint author , along with Lord Buckhurst , of the curious old tragedy of ‘ Gorboduc , ’ ) Robert Wisdome , William Hunnis , William Baldwyn , Parker , the scholarly and celebrated Archbishop of Canterbury , &amp; c. &amp; c. Parker trans - lated all the Psalms himself ; and John Day published in 1562 , and attached to the Book of Common Prayer , the whole of Sternhold and Hopkins ’ ‘ Psalms , with apt notes to sing them withall . ’ In Edward 's reign appeared a very different strain — the first drinking-song of merit in the language , ‘ Back and sides go bare ’ — ( see ‘ Specimens , ’ vol . 2 . ) This song occurs at the opening of the second act of ‘ Gammer Gurton 's Needle , ’ a comedy written ( by a ‘ Mr S . ’ ) and printed in 1551 , and afterwards acted at Christ 's College in Cambridge .</p>
     <p>In the reign of Mary , flourished Richard Edwards , a man of no small versatility of genius . He was a native of Somersetshire , was born about 1523 , and died in 1566 . He wrote two comedies , one entitled ‘ Damon and Pythias , ’ and the other ‘ Palamon and Arcité , ’ both of which were acted before Queen Elizabeth . He also contrived masques and wrote verses for pageants , and is said to have been the first fiddler , the most elegant sonnetteer , and the most amusing mimic of the Court . He is the author of a pleasing poem , entitled ‘ Amantium irae , ’ and of some lines under the title , ‘ He requesteth some friendly comfort , affirming his constancy . ’ We quote a few of them :—</p>

       <l n="5">The lion 's force , whose courage stout declares a prince-like might ,</l>
       <l n="6">The eagle , that for worthiness is borne of kings in fight —</l>

       <l n="8">And , like to time , do quite consume and fade from form to clay ;</l>
       <l n="9">But my true heart and service vow 'd shall last time out of mind ,</l>
       <l n="10">And still remain , as thine by doom , as Cupid hath assign 'd . ’</l>

     <p>GEORGE GASCOIGNE .</p>
     <p>Gascoigne was born in 1540 , in Essex , of an ancient family . He was educated at Cambridge , and entered at Gray 's Inn , but was disinherited by his father for extravagance , and betook himself to Holland , where he obtained a commission from the Prince of Orange . After various vicissitudes of fortune , being at one time taken prisoner by the Spaniards , and at another receiving a reward from the Prince of three hundred guilders above his pay for his brave conduct at the siege of Middleburg , he returned to England . In 1575 , he accompanied Queen Elizabeth in one of her progresses , and wrote for her a mask , entitled ‘ The Princely Pleasures of Kenilworth . ’ He is said to have died at Stamford in 1578 . He is the author of two or three translated dramas , such as ‘ The Supposes , ’ a comedy from Ariosto , and ‘ Jocasta , ’ a tragedy from Euripides , besides some graceful and lively minor pieces , one or two of which we append .</p>

     <lg type="poem">
      <head>THOMAS SACKVILLE , LORD BUCKHURST AND EARL OF DORSET .</head>
      <head>This was a man of remarkable powers . He was the son of Sir Richard Sackville , and born at Withyam , in Sussex , in 1527 . He was educated and became distinguished at both the universities . While a student of the Inner Temple , he wrote , some say in conjunction with Thomas Norton , the tragedy of ‘ Gorboduc , ’ which is probably the earliest original tragedy in the English language . It was first played as part of a Christmas entertainment by the young students , and subsequently before Queen Elizabeth at Whitehall in 1561 . Sackville was elected to Parliament when thirty years of age . In the same year ( 1557 ) he formed the plan of a magnificent poem , which , had he fully accomplished it , would have ranked his name with Dante , Spenser , and Bunyan . This was his ‘ Mirrour for Magistrates , ’ a poem intended to celebrate the chief of the illustrious unfortunates in British history , such as King Richard II ., Owen Glendower , James I. of Scotland , Henry VI ., Jack Cade , the Duke of Buckingham , &amp; c ., in a series of legends , supposed to be spoken by the characters them - selves , and with epilogues interspersed to connect the stories . The work aspired to be the English ‘ Decameron ’ of doom , and the part of it extant is truly called by Campbell ‘ a bold and gloomy landscape , on which the sun never shines . ’ Sackville had coadjutors in the work , all men of considerable mark , such as Skelton , Baldwyn , a learned ecclesiastic , and Ferrers , a man of rank . The first edition of the ‘ Mirrour for Magistrates ’ appeared in 1559 , and was wholly composed by Baldwyn and Ferrers . In the second , which was issued in 1563 , appeared the ‘ Induction and Legend of Henry Duke of Buckingham ’ from Sackville 's own pen . He lays the scene in hell , and descends there under the guidance of Sorrow . His pictures are more condensed than those of Spenser , although less so than those of Dante , and are often startling in their power , and deep , desolate grandeur . Take this , for instance , of ‘ Old Age : ’ —</head>
       <l n="1">‘ Crook-back 'd he was , tooth-shaken , and blear-eyed ,</l>
       <l n="2">Went on three feet , and sometime crept on four ,</l>
       <l n="3">With old lame bones , that rattled by his side ;</l>
       <l n="4">His scalp all piled , and he with eld forelore ,</l>
       <l n="5">His wither 'd fist still knocking at Deaths door ;</l>
       <l n="6">Fumbling and drivelling , as he draws his breath ;</l>
       <l n="7">For brief — the shape and messenger of Death . ’</l>
     </lg>
     <p>Politics diverted Sackville from poetry . This is deeply to be regretted , as his poetic gift was of a very rare order . In 1566 , on the death of his father , he was promoted to the title of Lord Buckhurst . In the fourteenth year of Elizabeth 's reign he was employed by her in an embassy to Charles IX . of France . In 1587 he went as an ambassador to the United Provinces . He was subsequently made Knight of the Garter and Chancellor of Oxford . On the death of Lord Burleigh he became Lord High Treasurer of England . In March 1604 he was created Earl of Dorset by James I ., but died suddenly soon after , at the council table , of a disease of the brain . He was , as a statesman , almost immaculate in reputation . Like Burke and Canning , in later days , he carried taste and literary exactitude into his political functions , and , on account of his eloquence , was called ‘ the Bell of the Star-Chamber . ’ Even in that Augustan age of our history , and in that most brilliantly intellectual Court , it may be doubted if , with the sole exception of Lord Bacon , there was a man to be compared to Thomas Sackville for genius .</p>

     <p>SIR PHILIP SIDNEY .</p>
     <p>All hail to Sidney !— the pink of chivalry — the hero of Zutphen — the author of the ‘ Arcadia , ’ — the gifted , courteous , genial and noble-minded man ! He was born November 29 , 1554 , at Penshurst , Kent . His father 's name was Henry . He studied at Shrewsbury , at Trinity College , Cambridge , and at Christ Church , Oxford . At the age of eighteen he set out on his travels , and , in the course of three years , visited France , Flanders , Germany , Hungary , and Italy . On his return he was introduced at Court , and became a favourite with Queen Elizabeth , who sent him on an embassy to Germany . He returned home , and shortly after had a quarrel at a tournament with Lord Oxford . But for the interference of the Queen , a duel would have taken place . Sidney was displeased at the issue of the affair , and retired , in 1580 , to Wilton , in Wiltshire , where he wrote his famous ‘ Arcadia , ’ — that true prose-poem , and a work which , with all its faults , no mere sulky and spoiled child ( as some have called him in the matter of this retreat ) could ever have produced . This production , written as an outflow of his mind in its self-sought solitude , was never meant for publication , and did not appear till after its author 's death . As it was written partly for his sister 's amusement , he entitled it ‘ The Countess of Pembroke 's Arcadia . ’ In 1581 , Sidney reappeared in Court , and distinguished himself in the jousts and tournaments celebrated in honour of the Duke of Anjou ; and on the return of that prince to the Continent , he accompanied him to Antwerp . In 1583 he received the honour of knighthood . He published about this time a tract entitled ‘ The Defence of Poesy , ’ which abounds in the element the praise of which it celebrates , and which is , besides , distinguished by acuteness of argument and felicity of expression . In 1585 he was named one of the candidates for the crown of Poland ; but Queen Elizabeth , afraid of ‘ losing the jewel of her times , ’ prevented him from accepting this honour , and prevented him also from accompanying Sir Francis Drake on an expedition against the Spanish settlements in America . In the same year , however , she made him Governor of Flushing , and subsequently General of the Cavalry , under his uncle , the Earl of Leicester , who commanded the troops sent to assist the oppressed Dutch Protestants against the Spaniards . Here our hero greatly distinguished himself , particularly when capturing , in 1586 , the town of Axel . His career , however , was destined to be short . On the 22d of September of the same year he accidentally encountered a convoy of the enemy marching toward Zutphen . In the engagement which followed , his party triumphed ; but their brave commander received a shot in the thigh , which shattered the bone . As he was carried from the field , overcome with thirst , he called for water , but while about to apply it to his lips , he saw a wounded soldier carried by who was eagerly eyeing the cup . Sidney , perceiving this , instantly delivered to him the water , saying , in words which would have made an ordinary man immortal , but which give Sir Philip a twofold immortality , ‘ Thy necessity is greater than mine . ’ He was carried to Arnheim , and lingered on till October 17 , when he died . He was only thirty-two years of age . His death was an earthquake at home . All England wore mourning for him . Queen Elizabeth ordered his remains to be carried to London , and to receive a public funeral in St Paul 's . He was identified with the land 's Poetry , Politeness , and Protestantism ; and all who admired any of the three , sorrowed for Sidney .</p>
     <p>Sidney 's ‘ Sonnets and other Poems ’ contain much that is quaint , but also much that is beautiful and true ; yet they are the least poetical of his works . His ‘ Arcadia ’ is a glorious unfinished and unpolished wilderness of fancy . It is a vineyard , the scattered clusters of which are so heavy , that , like the grapes of Eshcol of old , they must be carried on a staff . Here is one of those rich clusters :—</p>
     <p>‘ There were hills , which garnished their proud heights with stately trees ; humble valleys , whose base estate seemed comforted with the refreshing of silver rivers ; meadows , enamelled with all sorts of eye-pleasing flowers ; thickets , which , being lined with most pleasant shade , were witnessed so , too , by the cheerful disposition of many well-tuned birds ; each pasture stored with sheep , feeding with sober security ; while the pretty lambs , with bleating oratory , craved the dams ’ comfort ; here a shepherd 's boy , piping as though he should never be old ; there a young shepherdess , knitting and withal singing , and it seemed that her voice comforted her hands to work , and her hands kept time to her voice-music . ’</p>
     <p>From ‘ The Defence of Poesy ’ we could cull , did space permit , a hundred passages even superior to the above , full of dexterous reasoning , splendid rhetoric , and subtle fancy , and substantiating all that has been said in favour of Sir Philip Sidney 's accomplishments , chivalric earnestness , and richly-endowed genius .</p>

     <p>ROBERT SOUTHWELL .</p>
     <p>Robert Southwell was born in 1560 , at St . Faith 's , Norfolk . His parents were Roman Catholics , and sent him when very young to be educated at the English College of Douay , in Flanders . Thence he went to Borne , and when sixteen years of age he joined the Society of the Jesuits — a strange bed for the rearing of a poet . In 1585 , he was appointed Prefect of Studies , and was soon after despatched as a missionary of his order to England . There , notwithstanding a law condemning to death all members of his profession found in this country , he laboured on for eight years , residing chiefly with Anne , Countess of Arundel , who died afterwards in the Tower . In July 1592 , Southwell was arrested in a gentleman 's house at Uxendon in Middlesex . He was thrust into a dungeon so filthy that when he was brought out to be examined his clothes were covered with vermin . This made his father — a man of good family — petition Queen Elizabeth that if his son was guilty of anything deserving death he might suffer it , but that , meanwhile , being a gentleman , he should be treated as a gentleman . In consequence of this he was somewhat better lodged , but continued for nearly three years strictly confined to prison ; and as the Queen 's agents imagined that he was in the secret of some conspiracies against the Government , he was put to the torture ten times . In despair , he entreated to be brought to trial , whereupon Cecil coolly remarked , ‘ that if he was in such haste to be hanged , he should quickly have his desire . ’ On the 20th of February 1595 , he was brought to trial at King 's Bench , and having confessed himself a Papist and a Jesuit , he was condemned to death , and executed at Tyburn next day , with all the nameless barbarities enjoined by the treason laws of these unhappy times . He is believed to have borne all his sufferings with unalterable serenity of mind and sweetness of temper . ‘ It is fitting , ’ says Burke , ‘ that those made to suffer should suffer well . ’ And suffer well throughout all his short life of sorrow , Southwell did .</p>
     <p>He was , undoubtedly , although in a false position , a true man , and a true poet . To hope all things and believe all things , in reference to a Jesuit , is a difficult task for Protestant charity . Yet what system so vile but it has sometimes been gloriously misrepresented by its votaries ? Who that ever read Edward Irving 's ‘ Preface to Ben Ezra ’ — that modern Areopagitica — combining the essence of a hundred theological treatises with the spirit and grandeur of a Pindaric or Homeric ode — has forgot the pictures of Ben Ezra , or Lacunza the Jesuit ? His work , ‘ The Coming of the Messiah in Glory and Majesty , ’ Irving translated from Spanish into his own noble English prose , and he describes the author as a man of primitive manners , ardent piety , and enormous erudition , and expresses a hope , long since we trust fulfilled , of meeting with the ‘ good old Jesuit ’ in a better world . To this probably small class of exceptions to a general rule ( it surely is no uncharity to say this , since the annals of Jesuitism have confessedly been so stained with falsehood , treachery , every insidious art , and every detestable crime ) seems to have belonged our poet . No proof was produced that he had any connexion with the treacherous and bloody designs of his party , although he had plied his priestly labours with unwearied assiduity . He was too sincere-minded a man to have ever been admitted to the darker secrets of the Jesuits .</p>
     <p>His verses are ingenious , simpler in style than was common in his time — distinguished here by homely picturesqueness , and there by solemn moralising . A shade of deep but serene and unrepining sadness , connected partly with his position and partly with his foreseen destiny , ( his larger works were written in prison ,) rests on the most of his poems .</p>

     <p>THOMAS WATSON .</p>
     <p>He was born in 1560 , and died about 1592 . All besides known certainly of him is , that he was a native of London , and studied the common law , but seems to have spent much of his time in the practice of rhyme . His sonnets — one or two of which we subjoin — have considerable merit ; but we agree with Campbell in thinking that Stevens has surely overrated them when he prefers them to Shakspeare 's .</p>

     <p>In reference to the Miscellaneous Pieces which close this period , we need only say that the best of them is ‘ The Soul 's Errand , ’ and that its authorship is uncertain . It has , with very little evidence in any of the cases , been ascribed to Sir Walter Raleigh , to Francis Davison , ( author of a compilation entitled ‘ A Poetical Rhapsody , ’ published in 1593 , and where ‘ The Soul 's Errand ’ first appeared ,) and to Joshua Sylvester , who prints it in his volume of verses , with vile interpolations of his own . Its outspoken energy and pithy language render it worthy of any of our poets .</p>

     <p>SECOND PERIOD .</p>
     <p>FROM SPENSER TO DRYDEN .</p>
     <p>FRANCIS BEAUMONT .</p>
     <p>This remarkable man , from his intimate connexion with Fletcher , is better known as a dramatist than as a poet . He was the son of Judge Beaumont , and descended from an ancient family , which was settled at Grace Dieu in Leicestershire . He was born in 1585-86 , and educated at Cambridge . Thence he passed to study in the Inner Temple , but seems to have preferred poetry and the drama to law . He was married to the daughter of Sir Henry Isley of Kent , who bore him two daughters . He died in his 30th year , and was buried March 9 , 1615-16 , in St Benedict 's Chapel , Westminster Abbey . More of his connexion with Fletcher afterwards .</p>
     <p>After his death , his brother published a collection of his miscellaneous pieces . We extract a few , of no little merit . His verses to Ben Jonson , written before their author came to London , and first appended to a play entitled ‘ Nice Valour , ’ are picturesque and interesting , as illustrating the period .</p>

     <p>SIR WALTER RALEIGH .</p>
     <p>The verses attributed to this illustrious man are few , and the authenticity of some of them is doubtful . No one , however , who has studied his career , or read his ‘ History of the World , ’ can deny him the title of a great poet .</p>
     <p>We cannot be expected , in a work of the present kind , to enlarge on a career so well known as that of Sir Walter Kaleigh . He was born in 1552 , at Hayes Farm , in Devonshire , and descended from an old family there . He went early to Oxford , but finding its pursuits too tame for his active and enterprising spirit , he left it , and became a soldier at seventeen . For six years he fought on the Protestant side in France , besides serving a campaign in the Netherlands . In 1579 , he went a voyage , which proved disastrous , to Newfoundland , in company with his half-brother , Sir Humphrey Gilbert . There can be no doubt that this early apprenticeship to war and navigation was of material service to the future explorer and historian . In 1580 , he fought in Ireland against the Earl of Desmond , who had raised a rebellion there , and on one occasion is said to have defended a ford of Shannon against a whole band of wild Irish rebels , till the stream ran purple with their blood and his own . With the Lord - Deputy , Lord Grey de Wilton , he got into a dispute , and to settle it came over to England . Here high favour awaited him . His handsome appearance , his graceful address , his ready wit and chivalric courtesy , dashed with a fine poetic enthusiasm , ( see them admirably pictured in ‘ Kenilworth , ’ ) combined to exalt him in the estimation of Queen Elizabeth . On one occasion he flung his rich plush cloak over a miry part of the way , that she might pass on unsoiled . By this delicate piece of enacted flattery he ‘ spoiled a cloak and made a fortune . ’ The Queen sent him , along with some other courtiers , to attend the Duke of Anjou , who had in vain solicited her hand , back to the Netherlands . In 1584 , he fitted two ships , and sent them out for the discovery and settlement of those parts of North America not already appropriated by Christian states , and the next year there followed a fleet of seven ships under the command of Sir Richard Grenville , Raleigh 's kinsman . The attempt to colonise America at that time failed , but two important things were transplanted through means of the expedition from Virginia to Britain , namely , tobacco and the potato , — the former of which has ever since been offered up in smoky sacrifice to Raleigh 's memory throughout the whole world , and the latter of which has become the most valuable of all our vegetable esculents . Raleigh first planted the potato in Ireland , a country of which it has long been the principal food . A ludicrous story is told about this . It is said that he had invited a number of his neighbours to an entertainment , in which the new root was to form a prominent part , but when the feast began Raleigh found , to his horror , that the servants had boiled the plums , a most unsavoury mess , and immediately , we suppose , ‘ tabulae solvuntur risu . ’ In 1584 the Queen had knighted him , and shortly after she granted him certain lucrative monopolies , and an estate in Ireland , in addition to one he had possessed for some years . In 1588 , he was of material service as one of Her Majesty 's Council of War , formed to resist the Spanish Armada , and as one of the volunteers who joined the English fleet with ships of their own . Next year he accompanied a number of his countrymen in an expedition , which had it in view to restore Don Antonio to the throne of Portugal , of which the Spaniards had deprived him . On his return he lost caste considerably , both with the Queen and country , by taking bribes , and otherwise abusing the influence he had acquired at Court . Yet , about this time , his active mind was projecting what he called an ‘ Office of Address , ’ — a plan for facilitating the designs of literary and scientific men , promoting intercourse between them , gaining , in short , all those objects which are now secured by our literary associations and philosophical societies . Raleigh was eminently a man before his age , but , alas ! his age was too far behind him .</p>
     <p>While visiting Ireland , after his expedition to Portugal , he contracted an intimacy with Spenser . ( See our ‘ Life of Spenser , ’ vol . ii . ) In 1592 , he commanded a large naval expedition , destined to attack Panama and intercept the Spanish Plate-fleet , but was recalled by the Queen , not , however , till he had seized on an important prize , and , in common parlance , had ‘ feathered his nest . ’ On his return he excited Her Majesty 's wrath , by an intrigue with Elizabeth Throgmorton , one of the maids of honour , and , although Raleigh afterwards married her , the Queen imprisoned both the offending parties for some months in the Tower . Spenser is believed to allude to this in the 4th Book of his great poem . ( See vol . in . of our edition , p . 88 . ) Even after he was released from the Tower , Raleigh had to leave the Court in disgrace ; instead , however , of wasting time in vain regrets , he undertook , at his own expense , an expedition against Guiana , where he captured the city of San Joseph , and which he occupied in the Queen 's name . After his return he published an account of his expedition , more distinguished by glowing eloquence than by rigid regard to truth . In 1596 , having in some measure regained the Queen 's favour , he was appointed to a command in the expedition against Cadiz , under the Earl of Essex . In this , as well as in the expedition against the Spanish Plate-fleet the next year , he won laurels , but was unfortunate enough to excite the jealousy of his Commander-in-Chief . When the favourite got into trouble , Raleigh eagerly joined in the hunt , wrote a letter to Cecil urging him to the destruction of Essex , and witnessed his execution from a window in the Armoury . This is undoubtedly a deep blot on the escutcheon of our hero .</p>
     <p>Cecil had been glad of Raleigh 's aid in ruining Essex , but he bore him no good-will otherwise , and is said to have poisoned James , who now succeeded to the English throne , against him . Assuredly the new King was no friend of Raleigh 's . Stimulated by Cecil , after first depriving him of his office of Captain of the Guards , he brought him to trial for high treason . He was accused of conspiring to establish Popery , to dethrone the King , and to put the crown on the head of Arabella Stewart . Sir Edward Coke , the Attorney-General , led the accusation , and disgraced himself by heaping on Raleigh 's head every foul epithet , calling him ‘ viper , ’ ‘ damnable atheist , ’ ‘ monster , ’ ‘ traitor , ’ ‘ spider of hell , ’ &amp; c ., and by his violence , although to his own surprise , as he never expected to gain his cause in full , he browbeat the jury to bring in a verdict of high treason .</p>
     <p>Raleigh 's defence was a masterpiece of temper , dignity , strength of reasoning , and eloquence , and his enemies were ashamed of the decision to which they had driven the jury . He was therefore reprieved , and committed to the Tower , where his wife was allowed to bear him company , and where his youngest son was born . His estates were , in general , preserved to him , but Carr , the infamous minion of the King , under some pretext of a flaw in the conveyance of it by Raleigh to his son , seized upon his manor of Sherborne . In the Tower he continued for twelve years . These years his industry and genius rendered the happiest probably of his life . Immured in the</p>
     <p>‘ towers of Julius , London 's lasting shame , By many a foul and midnight murder fed , ’</p>
     <p>his winged soul soared away , like the dove of the Deluge , over the wild ocean of the past . The Tower confined his body , but this great globe the world seemed too little for the sweep of his spirit . To fill up the vast void which a long imprisonment created around him , and to shew that his powers retained all their elasticity , he projected a work on the largest scale , and with the noblest purpose — ‘ The History of the World . ’ In this undertaking he found literary men ready to lend him their aid . A hundred hands were generously stretched out to gather materials , and to bring them to the captive in the Tower . Cart-loads of books were sent . One Burrell , formerly his chaplain , assisted him in much of the critical and chronological drudgery . Rugged Ben Jonson sent in a piece of rugged writing on the Punic War , which Raleigh polished and set as a carved stone in his magnificent temple . Some have , on this account , sought to detract from the merit of the author . As if ever an architect could rear a building without hodmen ! But in Raleigh 's case the hodmen were Titans . ‘ The best wits in England assisted him in his undertaking ; ’ and what a compliment was this to the strength and stature of the master-builder !</p>
     <p>This great work was never finished . The part completed comprehended only the period from the Creation to the Downfall of the Macedonian Empire — one hundred and seventy years before Christ . He tarries too long amidst the misty and mythical ages which precede the dawn of history ; his speculations on the site of the original Paradise , on the Flood , &amp; c ., are more ingenious than instructive ; but his descriptions of the Greek battles — his account of the rise of Rome — the extensive erudition , on all subjects displayed in the book — the many acute , profound , and eloquently-expressed observations which are sprinkled throughout — and the style , massive , dignified , rich , and less involved in structure than that of almost any of his contemporaries — shall always rank it amongst the great literary treasures of the language . It was published in 1614 . Besides it , Raleigh was the author of various works , all full of sagacious thought and brilliant imagery , such as ‘ The Advice to a Son on the Choice of a Wife , ’ ‘ The Sceptic , ’ ‘ Maxims of State , ’ &amp; c. At last he was released by the advance of a large sum of money to Villiers , Duke of Buckingham , James 's favourite ; and , to retrieve his fortunes , projected another expedition to America . James granted him a patent , under the Great Seal , for making a settlement in Guiana , but ungenerously did not grant him a pardon for the sentence which had been passed on him for treason . He set sail , 1617 , in a ship built by himself , called the Destiny , with eleven other vessels . Having reached the Orinoco , he despatched a portion of his forces to attack the new Spanish settlement of St Thomas . This was captured , with the loss of Raleigh 's eldest son . The expected plunder , however , proved of little value ; and Sir Walter having in vain attempted to induce his captains to attack other settlements of the Spaniards , was compelled to return home — his golden dreams dissolved , and his prophetic soul forewarning him of the doom that awaited him on his native shores . In July 1618 , he landed at Plymouth ; ‘ whence , ’ says Howell , in his ‘ Familiar Letters , ’ ‘ he thought to make an escape , and some say he tampered with his body by physic to make him look sickly , that he might be the more pitied , and permitted to lie in his own house . ’ James was at this time seeking the hand of the Infanta for his son Charles , and was naturally disposed to side with the Spanish cause . He was , besides , stirred up by the Spanish ambassador , Count Gondomar , who sent to desire an audience with His Majesty , and said , that he had only one word to say to him . ‘ The King wondered what could be delivered in one word , whereupon , when he came before him , he said only , “ Pirates ! pirates ! pirates ! ” and so departed . ’</p>
     <p>Raleigh consequently was arrested and sent back to his old lodgings in the Tower . He was not tried , as might have been expected , for the new offence of waging war against a power then at amity with England , but James , with consummate meanness and cruelty , determined to revive his former sentence . He was brought before the King 's Bench , where his old enemy , Sir Edward Coke , now sat as Chief Justice , and officially condemned him to death . His language , however , was considerably modified to the prisoner . He said , ‘ I know you have been valiant and wise , and I doubt not but you retain both these virtues , for now you shall have occasion to use them . Your faith hath heretofore been questioned , but I am resolved you are a good Christian ; for your book , which is an admirable work , doth testify as much . I would give you counsel , but I know you can apply unto yourself far better than I can give you . Yet will I ( with the good neighbour in the Gospel , who , finding one in the way wounded and distressed , poured oil into his wounds and refreshed him ) give unto you the oil of comfort , though , in respect that I am a minister of the law , mixed with vinegar . ’ Such was Coke 's comfort to the brave and gifted man who stood untrembling before his bar .</p>
     <p>On the 26th of October 1618 , the day after his condemnation , Raleigh was beheaded . He met his fate with dignity and composure . Having addressed the multitude in vindication of his conduct , he took up the axe , and said to the sheriff , ‘ This is a sharp medicine , but a sound cure for all diseases . ’ He told the executioner that he would give the signal by lifting up his hand , and ‘ then , ’ he said , ‘ fear not , but strike home . ’ He next laid himself down , but was asked by the executioner to alter the position of the head . ‘ So the heart be right , ’ he replied , ‘ it is no matter which way the head lies . ’ The headsman became uncertain and tremulous when the signal was given , whereupon Ealeigh exclaimed , ‘ Why dost thou not strike ? Strike , man ! ’ and by two blows that gallant , witty , and richly-stored head was severed from the body . He was in his sixty-fifth year . He had the night before composed the following verse :—</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">Even such is Time , that takes on trust</l>
       <l n="2">Our youth , our joys , our all we have ,</l>
       <l n="3">And pays us but with age and dust ;</l>
       <l n="4">Who in the dark and silent grave ,</l>
       <l n="5">When we have wander 'd all our ways ,</l>
       <l n="6">Shuts up the story of our days . ’</l>
     </lg>
     <p>Thus perished Sir Walter Raleigh . There has been ever one opinion as to the breadth and brilliance of his genius . His powers were almost universal in their range . He commented on Scripture with the ingenuity of a Talmudist , and wrote love verses ( see the lines in Campbell 's ‘ Specimens , ’ entitled ‘ Dulcina ’ ) with the animus and graceful levity of a Thomas Moore . He was deep at once in ‘ all the learning of the Egyptians , ’ and in that of the Greeks and Romans . In his large mind lay dreams of golden lands , which even Australia has not yet fully verified , alongside of maxims of the most practical wisdom . He was learned in all that had been ; well-informed as to all that was ; and speculative and hopeful as to all that might be and was yet to be . Disgust at the scholastic methods , blended with the adventurous character of his mind , and perhaps also with some looseness of moral principle , led him at one time to the brink of universal scepticism ; but disappointment , sorrow , and the solitude of the Tower , made him a sadder and wiser man , and he returned to the verities of the Christian religion . The stains on his character seem to have arisen chiefly from his position . He was , like some greater and some smaller men of eminence , undoubtedly , to a certain extent , a brilliant adventurer — a class to whom justice is seldom done , and against whom every calumny is believed . He was a novus homo , in an age of more than common aristocratic pretence ; sprang , indeed , from an ancient family , but possessing nothing himself , save his cloak , his sword , his tact , and his genius . We all know how , in later times , such spirits , kindred in many points to Raleigh , in some superior , and in others inferior — as Burke , Sheridan , and Canning — were used , less for their errors of temper or of life , than because they had gained immense influence , not by birth or favour , but by the force of extraordinary talent and no less remarkable address . Raleigh , however , was undoubtedly imprudent in a high degree . He had once or twice outraged common morality ; his enemies were constantly accusing him of gasconading and of ‘ pride . ’ His success at first was too early and too easy , and hence a reverse might have been anticipated as certain and as remarkable as his rise had been . His fall ultimately is understood to have been precipitated by the base complicity of James with the Spaniards , who were informed by the King of Raleigh 's motions in America , and prepared to counteract them , as well as by the loud-sounding invectives and legal lies of the unscrupulous instruments of his tyrannical power . With all his faults and follies , ( of ‘ crimes , ’ it has been justly said , Raleigh can hardly be accused ,) he stood high in that crowd of giants who illustrated the reign of the Amazonian Queen . What an age it was ! Bacon , with still brighter powers , and far darker and meaner faults than Raleigh , was sitting on the woolsack in body , while his spirit was presiding over the half-born philosophies of the future , and beholding the cold rod of Induction blossom in an after-day into the Aaronic flowers and fruits of a magnificent science ; Cecil was nodding out wisdom or transcendental craft in the Cabinet ; Sir Philip Sidney was carrying the spirit of ‘ Arcadia ’ into the field of battle ; Spenser was dreaming his one beautiful lifelong Dream ; and Shakspeare was holding up his calm mirror to the heart of man and the universe of nature ; while , on the prow of the British vessel , carrying on those lofty spirits and enterprises , there appeared a daring mariner , the Poet and ‘ Shepherd of the Ocean , ’ with bright eye , sanguine countenance , step treading the deck like a throne , and look contemplating the sunset , as if it were the dawning , and the Evening , as if it were the Morning Star . It was the hopeful and the brilliant Raleigh , who , while he ‘ opened up to Europe the New World , was the historian of the Old . ’ Alas that this illustrious ‘ Marinere ’ was doomed to a life so troubled and a death so dreadful , and that the glory of one of England 's prodigies is for ever bound up with the disgrace of one of England 's and Scotland 's princes !</p>

     <p>JOSHUA SYLVESTER .</p>
     <p>Joshua Sylvester is the next in the list of our imperfectly-known , but real poets . Very little is known of his history . He was a merchant - adventurer , and died at Middleburg , aged fifty-five , in 1618 . He is said to have applied , in 1597 , for the office of secretary to a trading company in Stade , and to have been , on this occasion , patronised by the Earl of Essex . He was at one time attached to the English Court as a pensioner of Prince Henry . He is said to have been driven abroad by the severity of his satires . He seems to have had a sweet flow of conversational eloquence , and hence was called ‘ The Silver-tongued . ’ He was an eminent linguist , and wrote his dedications in various languages . He published a large volume of poems , very unequal in their value , and inserted in it ‘ The Soul 's Errand , ’ with interpolations , as we have seen , which prove it not to be his own . His great work is the translation of the ‘ Divine Weeks and Works ’ of the French poet , Du Bartas , which is a marvellous medley of flatness and force — of childish weakness and soaring genius — with more seed poetry in it than any poem we remember , except ‘ Festus , ’ the chaos of a hundred poetic worlds . There can be little doubt that Milton was familiar with this work in boyhood , and many remarkable coincidences have been pointed out between it and ‘ Paradise Lost . ’ Sylvester was a Puritan , and his publisher , Humphrey Lownes , who lived in the same street with Milton 's father , belonged to the same sect ; and , as Campbell remarks , ‘ it is easily to be conceived that Milton often repaired to the shop of Lownes , and there met with the pious didactic poem . ’ The work , therefore , some specimens of which we subjoin , is interesting , both in itself , and as having been the prima stamina of the great masterpiece of English poetry .</p>

      <head>ADDRESS TO THE NIGHTINGALE .</head>
       <l n="1">As it fell upon a day ,</l>
       <l n="2">In the merry month of May ,</l>
       <l n="3">Sitting in a pleasant shade</l>
       <l n="4">Which a grove of myrtles made ;</l>
       <l n="5">Beasts did leap , and birds did sing ,</l>
       <l n="6">Trees did grow , and plants did spring ;</l>
       <l n="7">Everything did banish moan ,</l>
       <l n="8">Save the nightingale alone .</l>
       <l n="9">She , poor bird , as all forlorn ,</l>
       <l n="10">Lean 'd her breast up-till a thorn ;</l>
       <l n="11">And there sung the dolefull'st ditty ,</l>
       <l n="12">That to hear it was great pity .</l>
       <l n="13">‘ Fie , fie , fie , ’ now would she cry ;</l>
       <l n="14">‘ Teru , teru , ’ by and by ;</l>
       <l n="15">That , to hear her so complain ,</l>
       <l n="16">Scarce I could from tears refrain ;</l>
       <l n="17">For her griefs , so lively shown ,</l>
       <l n="18">Made me think upon mine own .</l>
       <l n="19">Ah ! ( thought I ) thou mourn'st in vain ;</l>
       <l n="20">None takes pity on thy pain :</l>
       <l n="21">Senseless trees , they cannot hear thee ,</l>
       <l n="22">Ruthless bears they will not cheer thee :</l>
       <l n="23">King Pandion he is dead ;</l>
       <l n="24">All thy friends are lapp 'd in lead ;</l>
       <l n="25">All thy fellow-birds do sing ,</l>
       <l n="26">Careless of thy sorrowing !</l>
       <l n="27">Whilst as fickle Fortune smiled ,</l>
       <l n="28">Thou and I were both beguiled .</l>
       <l n="29">Every one that flatters thee</l>
       <l n="30">Is no friend in misery .</l>
       <l n="31">Words are easy , like the wind ;</l>
       <l n="32">Faithful friends are hard to find .</l>
       <l n="33">Every man will be thy friend</l>
       <l n="34">Whilst thou hast wherewith to spend :</l>
       <l n="35">But , if store of crowns be scant ,</l>
       <l n="36">No man will supply thy want .</l>
       <l n="37">If that one be prodigal ,</l>
       <l n="38">Bountiful they will him call ;</l>
       <l n="39">And with such-like flattering ,</l>
       <l n="40">‘ Pity but he were a king . ’</l>
       <l n="41">If he be addict to vice ,</l>
       <l n="42">Quickly him they will entice ;</l>
       <l n="43">But if Fortune once do frown ,</l>
       <l n="44">Then farewell his great renown :</l>
       <l n="45">They that fawn 'd on him before</l>
       <l n="46">Use his company no more .</l>
       <l n="47">He that is thy friend indeed ,</l>
       <l n="48">He will help thee in thy need ;</l>
       <l n="49">If thou sorrow , he will weep ,</l>
       <l n="50">If thou wake , he cannot sleep :</l>
       <l n="51">Thus , of every grief in heart</l>
       <l n="52">He with thee doth bear a part .</l>
       <l n="53">These are certain signs to know</l>
       <l n="54">Faithful friend from flattering foe .</l>

     <p>ALEXANDER HUME .</p>
     <p>This Scottish poet was the second son of Patrick , fifth Baron of Polwarth . He was born about the middle of the sixteenth century , and died in 1609 . He resided for some years , in the early part of his life , in France . Returning home , he studied law , and then tried his fortune at Court . Here he was eclipsed by a rival , named Montgomery ; and after assailing his rival , who rejoined , in verse , he became a clergyman in disgust , and was settled in the parish of Logie . Here he darkened into a sour and savage Calvinist , and uttered an exhortation to the youth of Scotland to forego the admiration of classical heroes , and to read no love-poetry save the ‘ Song of Solomon . ’ In another poetic walk , however , that of natural description , Hume excelled , and we print with pleasure some parts of his ‘ Summer 's Day , ’ which our readers may compare with Mr Aird 's fine poem under the same title , and be convinced that the sky of Scotland was as blue , and the grass as green , and Scottish eyes as quick to perceive their beauty , in the sixteenth century as now .</p>

      <head>OTHER SCOTTISH POETS .</head>
      <head>About the same time with Hume flourished two or three poets in Scotland of considerable merit , such as Alexander Scott , author of satires and amatory poems , and called sometimes the ‘ Scottish Anacreon ; ’ Sir Richard Maitland of Lethington , father of the famous Secretary Lethington , who , in his advanced years , composed and dictated to his daughter a few moral and conversational pieces , and who collected , besides , into a MS. which bears his name , the productions of some of his contemporaries ; and Alexander Montgomery , author of an allegorical poem , entitled ‘ The Cherry and the Slae . ’</head>

     <p>SAMUEL DANIEL .</p>
     <p>This ingenious person was born in 1562 , near Taunton , in Somersetshire . His father was a music-master . He was patronised by the noble family of Pembroke , who probably also maintained him at college . He went to Magdalene Hall , Oxford , in 1579 ; and after studying there , chiefly history and poetry , for seven years , he left without a degree . When twenty-three years of age , he translated Paulus Jovius ’ ‘ Discourse of Rare Inventions . ’ He became tutor to Lady Anne Clifford , the elegant and accomplished daughter of the Earl of Cumberland . She , at his death , raised a monument to his memory , and recorded on it , with pride , that she had been his pupil . After Spenser died , Daniel became a ‘ voluntary laureat ’ to the Court , producing masques and pageants , but was soon supplanted by ‘ rare Ben Jonson . ’ In 1603 he was appointed Master of the Queen 's Revels and Inspector of the Plays to be enacted by juvenile performers . He was also promoted to be Gentleman Extraordinary and Groom of the Chambers to the Queen . He was a varied and voluminous writer , composing plays , miscellaneous poems , and prose compositions , including a ‘ Defence of Rhyme ’ and a ‘ History of England , ’ — an honest , but somewhat dry and dull production . While composing his works he resided in Old Street , St Luke 's , which was then thought a suburban residence ; but he was often in town , and mingled on intimate terms with Selden and Shakspeare . When approaching sixty , he took a farm at Beckington , in Somersetshire — his native shire — and died there in 1619 .</p>
     <p>Daniel 's Plays and History are now , as wholes , forgotten , although the former contained some vigorous passages , such as Richard II . ' s soliloquy on the morning of his murder in Pomfret Castle . His smaller pieces and his Sonnets shew no ordinary poetic powers .</p>

     <p>SIR JOHN DAVIES .</p>
     <p>This knight , says Campbell , ‘ wrote , at twenty-five years of age , a poem on the “ Immortality of the Soul , ” and at fifty-two , when he was a judge and a statesman , another on the “ Art of Dancing . ” Well might the teacher of that noble accomplishment , in Molière 's comedy , exclaim , “ La philosophie est quelque chose — mais la danse ! ” This , however , is more pointed than correct , since the first of these poems was written in 1592 , when the author was only twenty-two years of age , and the latter appeared in 1599 , when he was only twenty-nine .</p>
     <p>Tisbury , in Wiltshire , was the birthplace of this poet , and 1570 the date of his birth . His father was a practising lawyer . John was expelled from the Temple for beating one Richard Martyn , afterwards Recorder , but was restored , and subsequently elected for Parliament . In 1592 , as aforesaid , appeared his poem , ‘ Nosce Teipsum ; or , The Immortality of the Soul . ’ Its fame soon travelled to Scotland ; and when Davies , along with Lord Hunsdon , visited that country , James received him most graciously as the author of ‘ Nosce Teipsum . ’ His history became , for some time , a list of promotions . He was appointed , in 1603 , first Solicitor and then Attorney-General in Ireland , was next made Sergeant , was then knighted , then appointed King 's Sergeant , next elected representative of the county of Fermanagh , and , in fine , after a violent contest between the Roman Catholic and Protestant parties , was chosen Speaker of the House of Commons in the Protestant interest . While in Ireland he married Eleanor , a daughter of Lord Audley , who turned out a raving prophetess , and was sent , in 1649 , to the Tower , and then to Bethlehem Hospital , by the Revolutionary Government . In 1616 , Sir John returned to England , continued to practise as a barrister , sat in Parliament for Newcastle - under-Lyne , and received a promise of being made Chief-Justice of England ; but was suddenly cut off by apoplexy in 1626 .</p>
     <p>His poem on dancing , which was written in fifteen days , and left a fragment , is a piece of beautiful , though somewhat extravagant fancy . His ‘ Nosce Teipsum , ’ if it casts little new light , and rears no demonstrative argument on the grand and difficult problem of immortality , is full of ingenuity , and has many apt and memorable similes . Feeling he happily likens to the</p>
     <p>‘ subtle spider , which doth sit In middle of her web , which spreadeth wide ; If aught do touch the utmost thread of it , She feels it instantly on every side . ’</p>
     <p>In answering an objection , ‘ Why , if souls continue to exist , do they not return and bring us news of that strange world ? ’ he replies —</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">‘ But as Noah 's pigeon , which return 'd no more ,</l>
       <l n="2">Did show she footing found , for all the flood ,</l>
       <l n="3">So when good souls , departed through death 's door ,</l>
       <l n="4">Come not again , it shows their dwelling good . ’</l>
     </lg>
     <p>The poem is interesting from the musical use he makes of the quatrain , a form of verse in which Dryden afterwards wrote his ‘ Annus Mirabilis , ’ and as one of the earliest philosophical poems in the language . It is proverbially difficult to reason in verse , but Davies reasons , if not always with conclusive result , always with energy and skill .</p>

     <p>GILES FLETCHER .</p>
     <p>Giles Fletcher was the younger brother of Phineas , and died twenty-three years before him . He was a cousin of Fletcher the dramatist , and the son of Dr Giles Fletcher , who was employed in many important missions in the reign of Queen Elizabeth , and , among others , negotiated a commercial treaty with Russia greatly in the favour of his own country . Giles is supposed to have been born in 1588 . He studied at Cambridge ; published his noble poem , ‘ Christ 's Victory and Triumph , ’ in 1610 , when he was twenty - three years of age ; was appointed to the living of Alderston , in Suffolk , where he died , in 1623 , at the early age of thirty-five , ‘ equally loved , ’ says old Wood , ‘ of the Muses and the Graces . ’</p>
     <p>The poem , in four cantos , entitled ‘ Christ 's Victory and Triumph , ’ is one of almost Miltonic magnificence . With a wing as easy as it is strong , he soars to heaven , and fills the austere mouth of Justice and the golden lips of Mercy with language worthy of both . He then stoops down on the Wilderness of the Temptation , and paints the Saviour and Satan in colours admirably contrasted , and which in their brightness and blackness can never decay . Nor does he fear , in fine , to pierce the gloom of Calvary , and to mingle his note with the harps of angels , saluting the Redeemer , as He sprang from the grave , with the song , ‘ He is risen , He is risen — and shall die no more . ’ The style is steeped in Spenser — equally mellifluous , figurative , and majestic . In allegory the author of the ‘ Fairy Queen ’ is hardly superior , and in the enthusiasm of devotion Fletcher surpasses him far . From the great light , thus early kindled and early quenched , Milton did not disdain to draw with his ‘ golden urn . ’ ‘ Paradise Regained ’ owes much more than the suggestion of its subject to ‘ Christ 's Victory ; ’ and is it too much to say that , had Fletcher lived , he might have shone in the same constellation with the bard of the ‘ Paradise Lost ? ’ The plan of our ‘ Specimens ’ permits only a few extracts . Let those who wish more , along with a lengthened and glowing tribute to the author 's genius , consult Blackwood for November 1835 . The reading of a single sentence will convince them that the author of the paper was Christopher North .</p>

     <p>JOHN DONNE .</p>
     <p>John Donne was born in London , in the year 1573 . He sprung from a Catholic family , and his mother was related to Sir Thomas More and to Heywood the epigrammatist . He was very early distinguished as a prodigy of boyish acquirement , and was entered , when only eleven , of Harthall , now Hertford College . He was designed for the law , but relinquished the study when he reached nineteen . About the same time , having studied the controversies between the Papists and Protestants , he deliberately went over to the latter . He next accompanied the Earl of Essex to Cadiz , and looked wistfully over the gulf dividing him from Jerusalem , with all its holy memories , to which his heart had been translated from very boyhood . He even meditated a journey to the Holy Land , but was discouraged by reports as to the dangers of the way . On his return he was received by the Lord Chancellor Ellesmere into his own house as his secretary . Here he fell in love with Miss More , the daughter of Sir George More , Lord - Lieutenant of the Tower , and the niece of the Chancellor . His passion was returned , and the pair were imprudent enough to marry privately . When the matter became known , the father-in-law became infuriated . He prevailed on Lord Ellesmere to drive Donne out of his service , and had him even for a short time imprisoned . Even when released he continued in a pitiable plight , and but for the kindness of Sir Francis Wooley , a son of Lady Ellesmere by a former marriage , who received the young couple into his family and entertained them for years , they would have perished .</p>
     <p>When Donne reached the age of thirty-four , Dr Merton , afterwards Bishop of Durham , urged him to take orders , and offered him a benefice , which he was generously to relinquish in his favour . Donne declined , on account , he said , of some past errors of life , which , ‘ though repented of and pardoned by God , might not be forgotten by men , and might cast dishonour on the sacred office . ’</p>
     <p>When Sir F. Wooley died , Sir Robert Drury became his next protector . Donne attended him on an embassy to France , and his wife formed the romantic purpose of accompanying her husband in the disguise of a page . Here was a wife fit for a poet ! In order to restrain her from her purpose , he had to address to her some verses , commencing ,</p>
     <p>‘ By our strange and fatal interview . ’</p>
     <p>Isaak Walton relates how the poet , one evening , as he sat alone in Paris , saw his wife appearing to him in vision , with a dead infant in her arms — a proof at once of the strength of his love and of his imagination . This beloved and admirable woman died in 1617 , a few days after giving birth to her twelfth child , and Donne 's grief approached distraction .</p>
     <p>When he had reached the forty-second year of his age , our poet , at the instance of King James , became a clergyman , and was successively appointed Chaplain to the King , Lecturer to Lincoln 's Inn , Dean of St Dunstan 's in the West , and Dean of St Paul 's . In the pulpit he attracted great attention , particularly from the more thoughtful and intelligent of his auditors . He continued Dean of St Paul 's till his death , which took place in 1631 , when he was approaching sixty . He died of consumption , a disease which seldom cuts down a man so near his grand climacteric .</p>
     <p>‘ He was buried , ’ says Campbell , ‘ in St Paul 's , where his figure yet remains in the vault of St Faith 's , carved from a painting , for which he sat a few days ’ ( it should be weeks ) ‘ before his death , dressed in his winding-sheet . ’ He kept this portrait constantly by his bedside to remind him of his mortality .</p>
     <p>Donne 's Sermons fill a large folio , with which we were familiar in boyhood , but have not seen since . De Quincey says , alluding partly to them , and partly to his poetry ,— ‘ Few writers have shewn a more extraordinary compass of powers than Donne , for he combined — what no other man has ever done — the last sublimation of dialectical subtlety and address with the most impassioned majesty . Massy diamonds compose the very substance of his poem on the ‘ Metempsychosis , ’ — thoughts and descriptions which have the fervent and gloomy sublimity of Ezekiel or Aeschylus ; while a diamond-dust of rhetorical brilliances is strewed over the whole of his occasional verses and his prose . ’ We beg leave to differ , in some degree , from De Quincey in his estimate of the ‘ Metempsychosis , ’ or ‘ The Progress of the Soul , ’ although we have given it entire . It has too many far-fetched conceits and obscure allegories , although redeemed , we admit , by some very precious thoughts , such as</p>
     <p>‘ This soul , to whom Luther and Mahomet were Prisons of flesh . ’</p>
     <p>Or the following quaint picture of the apple in Eden —</p>
     <lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">‘ Prince of the orchard , fair as dawning morn ,</l>
       <l n="2">Fenced with the law , and ripe as soon as born . ’</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="3">Or this —</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="4">‘ Nature hath no jail , though she hath law . ’</l>
      </lg>

     <p>If our readers , however , can admire the account the poet gives of Abel and his bitch , or see any resemblance to the severe and simple grandeur of Aeschylus and Ezekiel in the description of the soul informing a body , made of a ‘ female fish 's sandy roe ’ ‘ newly leavened with the male 's jelly , ’ we shall say no more .</p>
     <p>Donne , altogether , gives us the impression of a great genius ruined by a false system . He is a charioteer run away with by his own pampered steeds . He begins generally well , but long ere the close , quibbles , conceits , and the temptation of shewing off recondite learning , prove too strong for him , and he who commenced following a serene star , ends pursuing a will-o ’ - wisp into a bottomless morass . Compare , for instance , the ingenious nonsense which abounds in the middle and the close of his ‘ Progress of the Soul ’ with the dark , but magnificent stanzas which are the first in the poem .</p>
     <p>In no writings in the language is there more spilt treasure — a more lavish loss of beautiful , original , and striking things than in the poems of Donne . Every second line , indeed , is either bad , or unintelligible , or twisted into unnatural distortion , but even the worst passages discover a great , though trammelled and tasteless mind ; and we question if Dr Johnson himself , who has , in his ‘ Life of Cowley , ’ criticised the school of poets to which Donne belonged so severely , and in some points so justly , possessed a tithe of the rich fancy , the sublime intuition , and the lofty spirituality of Donne . How characteristic of the difference between these two great men , that , while the one shrank from the slightest footprint of death , Donne deliberately placed the image of his dead self before his eyes , and became familiar with the shadow ere the grim reality arrived !</p>
     <p>Donne 's Satires shew , in addition to the high ideal qualities , the rugged versification , the fantastic paradox , and the perverted taste of their author , great strength and clearness of judgment , and a deep , although somewhat jaundiced , view of human nature . That there must have been something morbid in the structure of his mind is proved by the fact that he wrote an elaborate treatise , which was not published till after his death , entitled , ‘ Biathanatos , ’ to prove that suicide was not necessarily sinful .</p>

     <p>MICHAEL DRAYTON ,</p>
     <p>The author of ‘ Polyolbion , ’ was born in the parish of Atherston , in Warwickshire , about the year 1563 . He was the son of a butcher , but displayed such precocity that several persons of quality , such as Sir Walter Aston and the Countess of Bedford , patronised him . In his childhood he was eager to know what strange kind of beings poets were ; and on coming to Oxford , ( if , indeed , he did study there ,) is said to have importuned his tutor to make him , if possible , a poet . He was supported chiefly , through his life , by the Lady Bedford . He paid court , without success , to King James . In 1593 ( having long ere this become that ‘ strange thing a poet ’ ) he published a collection of his Pastorals , and afterwards his ‘ Barons ’ Wars ’ and ‘ England 's Heroical Epistles , ’ which are both rhymed histories . In 1612-13 he published the first part of ‘ Polyolbion , ’ and in 1622 completed the work . In 1626 we hear of him being styled Poet Laureate , but the title then implied neither royal appointment , nor fee , nor , we presume , duty . In 1627 he published ‘ The Battle of Agincourt , ’ ‘ The Court of Faerie , ’ and other poems ; and , three years later , a book called ‘ The Muses ’ Elysium . ’ He had at last found an asylum in the family of the Earl of Dorset ; whose noble lady , Lady Anne Clifford , subsequently Countess of Pembroke , and who had been , we saw , Daniel 's pupil , after Drayton 's death in 1631 , erected him a monument , with a gold-lettered inscription , in Westminster Abbey .</p>
     <p>The main pillar of Drayton 's fame is ‘ Polyolbion , ’ which forms a poetical description of England , in thirty songs or books , to which the learned Camden appended notes . The learning and knowledge of this poem are exten - sive , and many of the descriptions are true and spirited , but the space of ground traversed is too large , and the form of versification is too heavy , for so long a flight . Campbell justly remarks ,— ‘ On a general survey , the mass of his poetry has no strength or sustaining spirit equal to its bulk . There is a perpetual play of fancy on its surface ; but the impulses of passion , and the guidance of judgment , give it no strong movements or consistent course . ’</p>
     <p>Drayton eminently suits a ‘ Selection ’ such as ours , since his parts are better than his whole .</p>

      <head>EDWARD FAIRFAX .</head>
      <head>Edward Fairfax was the second , some say the natural , son of Sir Thomas Fairfax of Denton , in Yorkshire . The dates of his birth and of his death are unknown , although he was living in 1631 . While his brothers were pursuing military glory in the field , Edward married early , and settled in Fuystone , a place near Knaresborough Forest . Here he spent part of his time in managing his elder brother , Lord Fairfax 's property , and partly in literary pursuits . He wrote a strange treatise on Demonology , a History of Edward the Black Prince , which has never been printed , some poor Eclogues , and a most beautiful translation of Tasso , which stamps him a true poet as well as a benefactor to the English language , and on account of which Collins calls him —</head>
       <l n="1">‘ Prevailing poet , whose undoubting mind</l>
       <l n="2">Believed the magic wonders which he sung . ’</l>

     <p>SIR HENRY WOTTON</p>
     <p>Was born in Kent , in 1568 ; educated at Winchester and Oxford ; and , after travelling on the Continent , became the Secretary of Essex , but had the sagacity to foresee his downfall , and withdrew from the kingdom in time . On his return he became a favourite of James I ., who employed him to be ambassador to Venice ,— a post he held long , and occupied with great skill and adroitness . Toward the end of his days , in order to gain the Provost - ship of Eton , he took orders , and died in that situation , in 1639 , in the 72d year of his age . His writings were published in 1651 , under the title of ‘ Reliquitae Wottonianae , ’ and Izaak Walton has written an entertaining account of his life . His poetry has a few pleasing and smooth-flowing passages ; but perhaps the best thing recorded of him is his viva voce account of an English ambassador , as ‘ an honest gentleman sent to LIE abroad for the good of his country . ’</p>

     <p>RICHARD CORBET .</p>
     <p>This witty and good-natured bishop was born in 1582 . He was the son of a gardener , who , however , had the honour to be known to and sung by Ben Jonson . He was educated at Westminster and Oxford ; and having received orders , was made successively Bishop of Oxford and of Norwich . He was a most facetious and rather too convivial person ; and a collection of anecdotes about him might be made , little inferior , in point of wit and coarseness , to that famous one , once so popular in Scotland , relating to the sayings and doings of George Buchanan . He is said , on one occasion , to have aided an unfortunate ballad-singer in his professional duty by arraying himself in his leathern jacket and vending the stock , being possessed of a fine presence and a clear , full , ringing voice . Occasionally doffing his clerical costume he adjourned with his chaplain , Dr Lushington , to the wine-cellar , where care and ceremony were both speedily drowned , the one of the pair exclaiming , ‘ Here 's to thee , Lushington , ’ and the other , ‘ Here 's to thee , Corbet . ’ Men winked at these irregularities , probably on the principle mentioned by Scott , in reference to Prior Aymer , in ‘ Ivanhoe , ’ — ‘ If Prior Aymer rode hard in the chase , or remained late at the banquet , men only shrugged up their shoulders by recollecting that the same irregularities were practised by many of his brethren , who had no redeeming qualities whatsoever to atone for them . ’ Corbet , on the other hand , was a kind as well as a convivial — a warm-hearted as well as an eccentric man . He was tolerant to the Puritans and sectaries ; his attention to his duties was respectable ; his talents were of a high order , and he had in him a vein of genius of no ordinary kind . He died in 1635 , but his poems were not published till 1647 . They are of various merit , and treat of various subjects . In his ‘ Journey to France , ’ you see the humorist , who , on one occasion , when the country people were flocking to be confirmed , cried , ‘ Bear off there , or I 'll confirm ye with my staff . ’ In his lines to his son Vincent , we see , notwithstanding all his foibles , the good man ; and in his ‘ Farewell to the Fairies ’ the fine and fanciful poet .</p>

      <head>BEN JONSON .</head>
      <head>As ‘ rare Ben ’ chiefly shone as a dramatist , we need not recount at length the events of his life . He was born in 1574 ; his father , who had been a clergyman in Westminster , and was sprung from a Scotch family in Annandale , having died before his birth . His mother marrying a bricklayer , Ben was brought up to the same employment . Disliking this , he enlisted in the army , and served with credit in the Low Countries . When he came home , he entered St John 's College , Cambridge ; but his stay there must have been short , since he is found in London at the age of twenty , married , and acting on the stage . He began at the same time to write dramas . He was unlucky enough to quarrel with and kill another performer , for which he was committed to prison , but released without a trial . He resumed his labours as a writer for the stage ; but having failed in the acting department , he forsook it for ever . His first hit was , ‘ Every Man in his Humour , ’ a play enacted in 1598 , Shakspeare being one of the actors . His course afterwards was chequered . He quarrelled with Marston and Dekker ,— he was imprisoned for some reflections on the Scottish nation in one of his comedies ,— he was appointed in 1619 poet - laureate , with a pension of 100 marks ,— he made the same year a journey to Scotland on foot , where he visited Drummond at Hawthornden , and they seem to have mutually loathed each other , ’ — he fell into habits of intemperance , and acquired , as he said himself ,</head>
       <l n="1">‘ A mountain belly and a rocky face . ’</l>
     </lg>
     <p>His favourite haunts were the Mermaid , and the Falcon Tavern , Southwark . He was engaged in constant squabbles with his contemporaries , and died at last , in 1637 , in miserably poor circumstances . He was buried in Westminster Abbey , under a square tablet , where one of his admirers afterwards inscribed the words ,</p>
     <p>‘ O rare Ben Jonson ! ’</p>
     <p>Of his powers as a dramatist we need not speak , but present our readers with some rough and racy specimens of his poetry .</p>

      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">Thou art not , Penshurst , built to envious show</l>
       <l n="2">Of touch or marble ; nor canst boast a row</l>
       <l n="3">Of polish 'd pillars , or a roof of gold :</l>
       <l n="4">Thou hast no lantern , whereof tales are told ;</l>
       <l n="5">Or stair , or courts ; but stand'st an ancient pile ,</l>
       <l n="6">And these grudged at , are reverenced the while .</l>
       <l n="7">Thou joy'st in better marks of soil and air ,</l>
       <l n="8">Of wood , of water ; therein thou art fair .</l>
       <l n="9">Thou hast thy walks for health as well as sport ;</l>
       <l n="10">Thy mount to which the dryads do resort ,</l>
       <l n="11">Where Pan and Bacchus their high feasts have made</l>
       <l n="12">Beneath the broad beech , and the chestnut shade ;</l>
       <l n="13">That taller tree which of a nut was set</l>
       <l n="14">At his great birth where all the Muses met .</l>
       <l n="15">There , in the writhed bark , are cut the names</l>
       <l n="16">Of many a Sylvan token with his flames .</l>
       <l n="17">And thence the ruddy Satyrs oft provoke</l>
       <l n="18">The lighter Fauns to reach thy Ladies ’ Oak .</l>
       <l n="19">Thy copse , too , named of Gamage , thou hast here</l>
       <l n="20">That never fails , to serve thee , season 'd deer ,</l>
       <l n="21">When thou would'st feast or exercise thy friends .</l>
       <l n="22">The lower land that to the river bends ,</l>
       <l n="23">Thy sheep , thy bullocks , kine , and calves do feed :</l>
       <l n="24">The middle ground thy mares and horses breed .</l>
       <l n="25">Each bank doth yield thee conies , and the tops</l>
       <l n="26">Fertile of wood . Ashore , and Sidney 's copse ,</l>
       <l n="27">To crown thy open table doth provide</l>
       <l n="28">The purpled pheasant , with the speckled side :</l>

       <l n="34">And pikes , now weary their own kind to eat ,</l>
       <l n="35">As both the second draught or cast to stay ,</l>
       <l n="36">Officiously , at first , themselves betray .</l>
       <l n="37">Bright eels that emulate them , and leap on land ,</l>

       <l n="41">The early cherry with the later plum ,</l>
       <l n="42">Fig , grape , and quince , each in his time doth come :</l>
       <l n="43">The blushing apricot and woolly peach</l>

       <l n="46">They 're rear 'd with no man 's ruin , no man 's groan ;</l>
       <l n="47">There 's none that dwell about them wish them down ;</l>
       <l n="48">But all come in , the farmer and the clown ,</l>
       <l n="49">And no one empty-handed , to salute</l>
       <l n="50">Thy lord and lady , though they have no suit .</l>
       <l n="51">Some bring a capon , some a rural cake ,</l>

       <l n="54">By their ripe daughters , whom they would commend</l>
       <l n="55">This way to husbands ; and whose baskets bear</l>
       <l n="56">An emblem of themselves , in plum or pear .</l>
       <l n="57">But what can this ( more than express their love )</l>
       <l n="58">Add to thy free provision , far above</l>
       <l n="59">The need of such ? whose liberal board doth flow</l>
       <l n="60">With all that hospitality doth know !</l>
       <l n="61">Where comes no guest but is allow 'd to eat</l>
       <l n="62">Without his fear , and of thy lord 's own meat :</l>
       <l n="63">Where the same beer , and bread , and selfsame wine</l>
       <l n="64">That is his lordship 's shall be also mine .</l>
       <l n="65">And I not fain to sit ( as some this day</l>
       <l n="66">At great men 's tables ) and yet dine away .</l>
       <l n="67">Here no man tells my cups ; nor , standing by ,</l>
       <l n="68">A waiter doth my gluttony envy :</l>
       <l n="69">But gives me what I call , and lets me eat ;</l>
       <l n="70">He knows below he shall find plenty of meat ;</l>
       <l n="71">Thy tables hoard not up for the next day ,</l>
       <l n="72">Nor , when I take my lodging , need I pray</l>
       <l n="73">For fire , or lights , or livery : all is there ,</l>
       <l n="74">As if thou , then , wert mine , or I reign 'd here .</l>
       <l n="75">There 's nothing I can wish , for which I stay .</l>
       <l n="76">This found King James , when hunting late this way</l>
       <l n="77">With his brave son , the Prince ; they saw thy fires</l>
       <l n="78">Shine bright on every hearth , as the desires</l>
       <l n="79">Of thy Penates had been set on flame</l>
       <l n="80">To entertain them ; or the country came ,</l>
       <l n="81">With all their zeal , to warm their welcome here .</l>
       <l n="82">What ( great , I will not say , but ) sudden cheer</l>
       <l n="83">Did'st thou then make them ! and what praise was heap 'd</l>
       <l n="84">On thy good lady then , who therein reap 'd</l>
       <l n="85">The just reward of her high housewifery ;</l>
       <l n="86">To have her linen , plate , and all things nigh ,</l>
       <l n="87">When she was far ; and not a room but drest</l>

       <l n="91">His children * * *</l>

     <p>In the same age of fertile , seething mind which produced Jonson and the rest of the Elizabethan giants , there flourished some minor poets , whose names we merely chronicle : such as Edward Vere , Earl of Oxford , born 1534 , and dying 1604 , who travelled in Italy in his youth , and returned the ‘ most accomplished coxcomb in Europe , ’ who sat as Grand Chamberlain of England upon the trial of Mary Queen of Scots , and who has left , in the ‘ Paradise of Dainty Devices , ’ some rather beautiful verses , entitled , ‘ Fancy and Desire ; ’ — as Thomas Storrer , a student of Christ Church , Oxford , and the author of a versified ‘ History of Cardinal Wolsey , ’ in three parts , who died in 1604 ;— as William Warner , a native of Oxfordshire , born in 1558 , who became an attorney of the Common Pleas in London , and died suddenly in 1609 , having made himself famous for a time by a poem , entitled ‘ Albion 's England , ’ called by Campbell ‘ an enormous ballad on the history , or rather the fables appendant to the history of England , ’ with some fine touches , but heavy and prolix as a whole ;— as Sir John Harrington , who was the son of a poet and the favourite of Essex , who was created a Knight of the Bath by James I ., and who wrote some pointed epigrams and a miserable translation of Ariosto , in which heeffectually tamed that wild Pegasus ; — as Henry Perrot , who collected , in 1613 , a book of epigrams , entitled , ‘ Springes for Woodcocks ; ’ — as Sir Thomas Overbury , whose dreadful and mysterious fate , well known to all who read English history , excited such a sympathy for him , that his poems , ‘ A Wife , ’ and ‘ The Choice of a Wife , ’ passed through sixteen editions before the year 1653 , although his prose ‘ Characters , ’ such as the exquisite and well-known ‘ Fair and Happy Milkmaid , ’ are far better than his poetry ;— as Samuel Rowlandes , a prolific pamphleteer in the reigns of Elizabeth , James I ., and Charles I ., author also of several plays and of a book of epigrams ;— as Thomas Picke , who belonged to the Middle Temple , and published , in 1631 , a number of songs , sonnets , and elegies ;— as Henry Constable , born in 1568 , and a well-known sonneteer of his day ;— as Nicholas Breton , author of some pretty pastorals , who , it is conjectured , was born in 1555 , and died in 1624 ;— and as Dr Thomas Lodge , born in 1556 , and who died in 1625 , after translating Josephus into English , and writing some tolerable poetical pieces .</p>
     <p>THOMAS RANDOLPH .</p>
     <p>This was a true poet , although his power comes forth principally in the drama . He was born at Newnham , near Daventry , Northamptonshire , in 1605 , being the you of Lord Zouch 's steward . He became a King 's Scholar at Westminster , and subsequently a Fellow in Trinity College , Cambridge . Ben Jonson loved him , and he reciprocated the attachment . Whether from natural tendency or in imitation of Jonson , who called him , as well as Cartwright , his adopted son , he learned intemperate habits , and died , in 1634 , at the age of twenty-nine . His death took place at the house of W. Stafford , Esq . of Blatherwyke , in his native county , and he was buried in the church beside , where Sir Christopher , afterwards Lord Hatton , signalised the spot of his rest by a monument . He wrote five dramas , which are imperfect and formal in plan , but written with considerable power . Some of his miscellaneous poems discover feeling and genius .</p>

      <head>ROBERT BURTON .</head>
      <head>The great , though whimsical author of the ‘ Anatomy of Melancholy ’ was born at Lindley , in Leicestershire , 1576 , and educated at Christ Church , Oxford . He became Rector of Seagrave , in his native shire . He was a man of vast erudition , of integrity and benevolence , but his happiness , like that of Burns , although in a less measure , ‘ was blasted ab origine by an incurable taint of hypochondria ; ’ and although at times a most delightful companion , at other times he was so miserable , even when a young student at Oxford , that he had no resource but to go down to the river-side , where the coarse jests of the bargemen threw him into fits of laughter . This surely was a violent remedy , and one that must have reacted into deeper depression . In 1621 , he wrote and published , as a safety-valve to his morbid feelings , his famous ‘ Anatomie of Melancholy , by Democritus Junior . ’ It became instantly popular , and sold so well , that the publisher is said to have made a fortune by it . Nothing more of consequence is recorded of the author , who died in 1640 . Although</head>
       <l n="1">‘ Melancholy mark 'd him for her own , ’</l>
     </lg>
     <p>she failed to kill him till he had passed his grand climacteric . He was buried in Christ Church , with the following epitaph , said to have been composed by himself :—</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">‘ Paucis notus , paucioribus ignotus .</l>
       <l n="2">Hic jacet Democritus Junior ,</l>
       <l n="3">Cui vitam pariter et mortem</l>
       <l n="4">Dedit Melancholia !</l>
     </lg>
     <p>‘ Known [ by name ] to few , unknown [ as the author of the “ Anatomy ” ] to fewer , here lies D. J ., who owes his death [ as a man ] and his life [ as an author ] to Melancholy . ’</p>
     <p>His work is certainly a most curious and bewitching medley of thought , information , wit , learning , personal interest , and poetic fancy . We all know it was the only book which ever drew the lazy Johnson from his bed an hour sooner than he wished to rise . The subject , like the flesh of that ‘ melancholy ’ creature the hare , may be dry , but , as with that , an astute cookery prevails to make it exceedingly piquant ; the sauce is better than the substance . Burton 's melancholy is not , like Johnson 's , a deep , hopeless , ‘ inspissated gloom , ’ thickened by memories of remorse , and lighted up by the lurid fires of feared perdition ; it is not , like Byron 's , dashed with the demoniac element , and fretted into universal misanthropy ; it is not , like Foster 's , the sad , fixed fascination of a pure intelligence contemplating the darker side of things , as by a necessity of nature , and ignoring , without denying , the existence of the bright ; nor is it , like that of the ‘ melancholy Jacques , ’ in ‘ As you Like it , ’ a wild , woodland , fantastical habit of thought , as of one living collaterally and aside to the world , and which often explodes into laughter at itself and at all things else ;— Burton 's is a wide - spread but tender shade , like twilight , diffused over the whole horizon of his thought , and is nourished at times into a luxury , and at times paraded as a peculiar possession . In his form of melancholy there are pleasures as well as pains . ‘ Most pleasant it is , ’ he says , ‘ to such as are to melancholy given , to lie in bed whole days and keep their chambers ; to walk alone in some solitary grove , betwixt wood and water , by a brook-side , to meditate upon some delightsome and pleasant subject ; and a most incomparable delight it is so to melancholise and build castles in the air . ’ Religious considerations have little to do with Burton 's melancholy , and remorse or fear apparently nothing . Hence his book , although its theme be sadness , never shadows the spirit , but , on the contrary , from his dark , Lethean poppies , his readers are made to extract an element of joyful excitement , and the anatomy , and the cure , of the evil , are one and the same .</p>
     <p>As a writer , Burton ranks , in some points , with Montaigne , and in others with Sir Thomas Browne . He resembles the first in simplicity , bonhommie , and miscellaneous learning , and the other in rambling manner , quaint phraseology , and fantastic imagination . Neither of the three could be said to write books , but they accumulated vast storehouses , whence thousands of volumes might be , and have been compiled . There is nothing in Burton so low as in many of the ‘ Essays ’ of Montaigne , but there is nothing so lofty as in passages of Browne 's ‘ Religio Medici ’ and ‘ Urn-Burial . ’ Burton has been a favourite quarry to literary thieves , among whom Sterne , in his ‘ Tristram Shandy , ’ stands pre-eminent . To his ‘ Anatomy ’ he prefixes a poem , a few stanzas of which we extract .</p>

     <p>THOMAS CAREW .</p>
     <p>This delectable versifier was born in 1589 , in Gloucestershire , from an old family in which he sprung . He was educated at Corpus Christi College , Oxford , but neither matriculated nor took a degree . After finishing his travels , he returned to England , and became soon highly distinguished , in the Court of Charles I ., for his manners , accomplishments , and wit . He was appointed Gentleman of the Privy Chamber and Sewer in Ordinary to the King . He spent the rest of his life as a gay and gallant courtier ; and in the intervals of pleasure produced some light but exquisite poetry . He is said , ere his death , which took place in 1639 , to have become very devout , and bitterly to have deplored the licentiousness of some of his verses .</p>
     <p>Indelicate choice of subject is often , in Carew , combined with great delicacy of execution . No one touches dangerous themes with so light and glove-guarded a hand . His pieces are all fugitive , but they suggest great possibilities , which his mode of life and his premature removal did not permit to be realised . Had he , at an earlier period , renounced , like George Herbert , ‘ the painted pleasures of a court , ’ and , like Prospero , dedicated himself to ‘ closeness , ’ with his marvellous facility of verse , his laboured levity of style , and his nice exuberance of fancy , he might have produced some work of Horatian merit and classic permanence .</p>

     <p>SIR JOHN SUCKLING .</p>
     <p>This witty baronet was born in 1608 . He was the son of the Comptroller of the Household of Charles I . He was uncommonly precocious ; at five is said to have spoken Latin , and at sixteen had entered into the service of Gustavus Adolphus , ‘ the lion of the North , and the bulwark of the Protestant faith . ’</p>
     <p>On his return to England , he was favoured by Charles , and became , in his turn , a most enthusiastic supporter of the Royal cause ; writing plays for the amusement of the Court ; and when the Civil War broke out , raising , at his own expense of £ 1200 , a regiment for the King , which is said to have been distinguished only by its ‘ finery and cowardice . ’ When the Earl of Strafford came into trouble , Suckling , along with some other cavaliers , intrigued for his deliverance , was impeached by the House of Commons , and had to flee to France . Here an early death awaited him . His servant having robbed him , he drew on , in vehement haste , his boots , to pursue the defaulter , when a rusty nail , or , some say , the blade of a knife , which was concealed in one of them , pierced his heel . A mortification ensued , and he died , in 1641 , at thirty-three years of age .</p>
     <p>Suckling has written five plays , various poems , besides letters , speeches , and tracts , which have all been collected into one thin volume . They are of various merit ; none , in fact , being worthy of print , or at least of preservation , except one or two of his songs , and his ‘ Ballad upon a Wedding ’ . This last is an admirable expression of what were his principal qualities — naiveté , sly humour , gay badinage , and a delicious vein of fancy , coming out occasionally by stealth , even as in his own exquisite lines about the bride ,</p>

     <p>WILLIAM CARTWRIGHT .</p>
     <p>Cartwright was born in 1611 , and was the son of an innkeeper — once a gentleman — in Cirencester . He became a King 's scholar at Westminster , and afterwards took orders at Oxford , where he distinguished himself , according to Wood , as a ‘ most florid and seraphic preacher . ’ One is reminded of the description given of Jeremy Taylor , who , when he first began to preach , by his ‘ young and florid beauty , and his sublime and raised discourses , made men take him for an angel newly descended from the climes of Paradise . ’ Cartwright was appointed , through his friend Bishop Duppa , Succentor of the Church of Salisbury in 1642 . He was one of a council of war appointed by the University of Oxford , for providing troops in the King 's cause , to protect , or some said to overawe , the Universities . He was imprisoned by the Parliamentary forces on account of his zeal in the Royal cause , but soon liberated on bail . In 1643 , he was appointed Junior Proctor of his University , and also Reader in Metaphysics . At this time he is said to have studied sixteen hours a-day . This , however , seems to have weakened his constitution , and rendered him an easy victim to what was called the camp-fever , then prevalent in Oxford . He died December 23 , 1643 , aged thirty-two . The King , then in Oxford , went into mourning for him . His works were published in 1651 , and to them were prefixed fifty copies of encomiastic verses from the wits and poets of the time . They scarcely justify the praises they have received , being somewhat crude and harsh , and all of them occasional . His private character , his eloquence as a preacher , and his zeal as a Royalist , seem to have supplemented his claims as a poet . He enjoyed , too , in his earlier life , the friendship of Ben Jonson , who used to say of him , ‘ My son Cartwright writes all like a man ; ’ and such a sentence from such an authority was at that time fame .</p>

     <p>WILLIAM BROWNE .</p>
     <p>This pastoral poet was born , in 1590 , at Tavistock , in Devonshire , a lovely part of a lovely county . He was educated at Oxford , and went thence to the Inner Temple . He was at one time tutor to the Earl of Carnarvon , and afterwards , when that nobleman perished in the battle of Newbury , in 1643 , he was patronised by the Earl of Pembroke , in whose house he resided , and is even said to have become so rich that he purchased an estate . In 1645 he died , at Ottery St Mary , the parish where , in 1772 , Coleridge was born .</p>
     <p>Browne began his poetical career early , and closed it soon . He published the first part of ‘ Britannia 's Pastorals ’ in 1613 , the second in 1616 ; shortly after , his ‘ Shepherd 's Pipe ; ’ and , in 1620 , produced his ‘ Inner Temple Masque ’ which was then enacted , but not printed till a hundred and twenty years after the author 's death , when Dr Farmer transcribed it from a MS. of the Bodleian Library , and it appeared in Tom Davies ’ edition of Browne 's poems . Browne has no constructive power , and no human interest in his pastorals , but he has an eye for nature , and we quote from him some excellent specimens of descriptive poetry .</p>

       <l n="7">And he , as gladly granting , strikes it o'er</l>
       <l n="8">With some sweet relish was forgot before :</l>
       <l n="9">I would have been content , if he would play ,</l>
       <l n="10">In that one strain to pass the night away ;</l>
       <l n="11">But fearing much to do his patience wrong ,</l>
       <l n="12">Unwillingly have ask 'd some other song :</l>
       <l n="13">So in this differing key though I could well</l>
       <l n="14">A many hours but as few minutes tell ,</l>
       <l n="15">Yet lest mine own delight might injure you</l>
       <l n="16">( Though both so soon ) I take my song anew .</l>

     <p>WILLIAM ALEXANDER , EARL OF STIRLING .</p>
     <p>This eminent Scotchman was born in 1580 . He travelled on the Continent as tutor to the Duke of Argyle . After his return to Scotland , he fell in love with a lady , whom he calls ‘ Aurora , ’ and to whom he addressed some beautiful sonnets . She refused his hand , however , and he married the daughter of Sir William Erskine . He repaired to the Court of James I ., and became a distinguished favourite , being appointed Gentleman Usher to Charles I ., and created a knight . He concocted a scheme for colonising Nova Scotia , in which he was encouraged by both James and Charles ; but the difficulties seemed too formidable , and it was in consequence dropped . Charles appointed him Lord-Lieutenant of Nova Scotia , and , in 1633 , he created him Lord Stirling . Fifteen years ( from 1626 to 1641 ) our poet was Secretary of State for Scotland . These were the years during which Laud was foolishly seeking to force his liturgy upon the Presbyterians , but Stirling gained the praise of being moderate in his share of the business . In the course of this time he contrived to amass an ample fortune , and spent part of it in building a fine mansion in Stirling , which is still , we believe , standing . He died in 1641 .</p>
     <p>Besides his smaller pieces , Stirling wrote several tragedies , including one on Julius Caesar ; an heroic poem ; a poem addressed to Prince Henry , the son of James I .; another heroic poem , entitled ‘ Jonathan ; ’ and a poem , in twelve parts , on the ‘ Day of Judgment . ’ These are all forgotten , and , notwithstanding vigorous parts , deserve to be forgotten ; but his little sonnets , which are , if not brilliant , true things , and inspired by a true passion , may long survive . He was , on the whole , rather a man of great talent than of genius .</p>

     <p>WILLIAM DRUMMOND .</p>
     <p>A man of much finer gifts than Stirling , was the famous Drummond . He was born , December 13 , 1585 , at Hawthornden , his father 's estate , in Mid - Lothian . It is one of the most beautiful spots , along the sides of one of the fairest streams in all Scotland , and well fitted to be the home of genius . He studied civil law for four years in France , but , in 1611 , the estate of Hawthornden became his own , and here he fixed his residence , and applied himself to literature . At this time he courted , and was upon the point of marrying , a lady named Cunningham , who died ; and the melancholy which preyed on his mind after this event , drove him abroad in search of solace . He visited Italy , Germany , and France ; and during his eight years of residence on the Continent , used his time well , conversing with the learned , admiring all that was admirable in the scenery and the life of foreign lands , and collecting rare books and manuscripts . He had , before his departure , published , first , a volume of occasional poems ; next , a moral treatise , in prose , entitled , ‘ The Cypress Grove ; ’ and then another work , in verse , ‘ The Flowers of Zion . ’ Returned once more to Scotland , he retired to the seat of his brother - in-law , Sir John Scott of Scotstarvet , and there wrote a ‘ History of the Five James 's of Scotland , ’ a book abounding in bombast and slavish principles . When he returned to his own lovely Hawthornden , he met a lady named Logan , of the house of Restalrig , whom he fancied to bear a striking resemblance to his dead mistress . On that hint he spake , and she became his wife . He proceeded to repair the house of Hawthornden , and would have spent his days there in great peace , had it not been for the distracted times . His politics were of the Royalist complexion ; and the party in power , belonging to the Presbyterians , used every method to annoy him , compelling him , for instance , to furnish his quota of men and arms to support the cause which he opposed . In 1619 , Ben Jonson visited him at Hawthornden . The pair were not well assorted . Brawny Ben and dreaming Drummond seem , in the expressive coinage of De Quincey , to have ‘ interdespised ; ’ and is not their feud , with all its circumstances , recorded in the chronicles of the ‘ Quarrels of Authors ’ compiled by the elder Disraeli ? The death of a lady sent Drummond travelling over Europe — the death of a King sent him away on a farther and a final journey . His grief for the execution of Charles I. is said to have shortened his days . At all events , in December of the year of the so-called ‘ Martyrdom , ’ ( 1649 ,) he breathed his last .</p>
     <p>He was a genuine poet as well as a brilliant humorist . His ‘ Polemo Middinia , ’ a grotesque mixture of bad Latin and semi-Latinised Scotch , has created , among many generations , inextinguishable laughter . His ‘ Wandering Muses ; or , The River of Forth Feasting , ’ has some gorgeous descriptions , particularly of Scotland 's lakes and rivers , at a time when</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">‘ She lay , like some unkenn 'd of isle ,</l>
       <l n="2">Ayont New Holland ; ’</l>
     </lg>
     <p>but his sonnets are unquestionably his finest productions . They breathe a spirit of genuine poetry . Each one of them is a rose lightly wet with the dew of tenderness , and one or two suggest irresistibly the recollection of our Great Dramatist 's sonnets , although we feel that ‘ a less than Shakspeare is here . ’</p>

     <p>PHINEAS FLETCHER</p>
     <p>We have already spoken of Giles Fletcher , the brother of Phineas . Of Phineas we know nothing except that he was born in 1584 , educated at Eton and Cambridge , became Rector at Hilgay , in Norfolk , where he remained for twenty-nine years , surviving his brother ; that he wrote an account of the founders and learned men of his university ; that in 1633 , he published ‘ The Purple Island ; ’ and that in 1650 he died .</p>
     <p>His ‘ Purple Island ’ ( with which we first became acquainted in the writings of James Hervey , author of the ‘ Meditations , ’ who was its fervent admirer ) is a curious , complex , and highly ingenious allegory , forming an elaborate picture of Man , in his body and soul ; and for subtlety and infinite flexibility , both of fancy and verse , deserves great praise , although it cannot , for a moment , be compared with his brother 's ‘ Christ 's Victory and Triumph , ’ either in interest of subject or in splendour of genius .</p>

     <p>SPECIMENS WITH MEMOIRS OF THE LESS-KNOWN BRITISH POETS .</p>
     <p>SECOND PERIOD — FROM SPENSER TO DRYDEN . ( CONTINUED . )</p>
     <p>WILLIAM HABINGTON .</p>
     <p>This poet might have been expected to have belonged to the ‘ Spasmodic school , ’ judging by his parental antecedents . His father was accused of having a share in Babington 's conspiracy , but was released because he was godson to Queen Elizabeth . Soon after , however , he was imprisoned a second time , and condemned to death on the charge of having concealed some of the Gunpowder-plot conspirators ; but was pardoned through the interest of Lord Morley . His uncle , however , was less fortunate , suffering death for his complicity with Babington . The poet 's mother , the daughter of Lord Morley , was more loyal than her husband or his brother , and is said to have written the celebrated letter to Lord Monteagle , in consequence of which the execution of the Gunpowder-plot was arrested .</p>
     <p>Our poet was born at Hindlip , Worcestershire , on the very day of the discovery of the plot , 5th November 1605 . The family were Papists , and William was sent to St Omers to be educated . He was pressed to become a Jesuit , but declined . On his return to England , his father became preceptor to the poet . As he grew up , instead of displaying any taste for ‘ treasons , stratagems , and spoils , ’ he chose the better part , and lived a private and happy life . He fell in love with Lucia , daughter of William Herbert , the first Lord Powis , and celebrated her in his long and curious poem entitled ‘ Castara . ’ This lady he afterwards married , and from her society appears to have derived much happiness . In 1634 , he published ‘ Castara . ’ He also , at different times , produced ‘ The Queen of Arragon , ’ a tragedy ; a History of Edward IV . ; and ‘ Observations upon History . ’ He died in 1654 , ( not as Southey , by a strange oversight , says , ‘ when he had just completed his fortieth year , ’ ) forty-nine years of age , and was buried in the family vault at Hindlip .</p>
     <p>‘ Castara ’ is not a consecutive poem , but consists of a great variety of small pieces , in all sorts of style and rhythm , and of all varieties of merit ; many of them addressed to his mistress under the name of Castara , and many to his friends ; with reflective poems , elegies , and panegyrics , intermingled with verses sacred to love . Habington is distinguished by purity of tone if not of taste . He has many conceits , but no obscenities . His love is as holy as it is ardent . He has , besides , a vein of sentiment which sometimes approaches the moral sublime . To prove this , in addition to the ‘ Selections ’ below , we copy some verses entitled —</p>

      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>There is something to us particularly interesting in the history of this poet . Even as it is pleasant to see the sides of a volcano covered with verdure , and its mouth filled with flowers , so we like to find the fierce elements , which were inherited by Habington from his fathers , softened and subdued in him ,— the blood of the conspirator mellowed into that of the gentle bard , who derived all his inspiration from a pure love and a mild and thoughtful religion .</p>

       <l n="1">He who is good is happy . Let the loud</l>
       <l n="2">Artillery of heaven break through a cloud ,</l>
       <l n="3">And dart its thunder at him , he 'll remain</l>

       <l n="5">In welcoming the approach of death , than Vice</l>

       <l n="7">Time mocks our youth , and ( while we number past</l>

       <l n="11">Of threat'ning death : pomp , beauty , wealth , and all</l>
       <l n="12">Our friendships , shrinking from the funeral .</l>
       <l n="13">The thought of this begets that brave disdain</l>

       <l n="17">What should we covet here ? Why interpose</l>

       <l n="19">Man 's soul the exchequer where to hoard her wealth ,</l>
       <l n="20">And lodge all her rich secrets ; but by the stealth</l>

       <l n="22">The creature merely sensual knows more .</l>
       <l n="23">The learned halcyon , by her wisdom , finds</l>
       <l n="24">A gentle season , when the seas and winds</l>
       <l n="25">Are silenced by a calm , and then brings forth</l>
       <l n="26">The happy miracle of her rare birth ,</l>

       <l n="36">By avarice in the possession poor .</l>
       <l n="37">And yet that idol wealth we all admit</l>
       <l n="38">Into the soul 's great temple ; busy wit</l>
       <l n="39">Invents new orgies , fancy frames new rites</l>
       <l n="40">To show its superstition ; anxious nights</l>
       <l n="41">Are watch 'd to win its favour : while the beast</l>
       <l n="42">Content with nature 's courtesy doth rest .</l>
       <l n="43">Let man then boast no more a soul , since he</l>
       <l n="44">Hath lost that great prerogative . But thee ,</l>
       <l n="45">Whom fortune hath exempted from the herd</l>
       <l n="46">Of vulgar men , whom virtue hath preferr 'd</l>
       <l n="47">Far higher than thy birth , I must commend ,</l>
       <l n="48">Rich in the purchase of so sweet a friend .</l>
       <l n="49">And though my fate conducts me to the shade</l>
       <l n="50">Of humble quiet , my ambition paid</l>
       <l n="51">With safe content , while a pure virgin fame</l>
       <l n="52">Doth raise me trophies in Castara 's name ;</l>
       <l n="53">No thought of glory swelling me above</l>
       <l n="54">The hope of being famed for virtuous love ;</l>
       <l n="55">Yet wish I thee , guided by the better stars ,</l>
       <l n="56">To purchase unsafe honour in the wars ,</l>
       <l n="57">Or envied smiles at court ; for thy great race ,</l>
       <l n="58">And merits , well may challenge the highest place .</l>
       <l n="59">Yet know , what busy path soe'er you tread</l>
       <l n="60">To greatness , you must sleep among the dead .</l>

      <head>TO HIS NOBLEST FRIEND , J. C ., ESQ .</head>
       <l n="1">I hate the country 's dirt and manners , yet</l>

     <p>JOSEPH HALL , BISHOP OF NORWICH .</p>
     <p>This distinguished man must not be confounded with John Hall , of whom all we know is , that he was born at Durham in 1627 ,— that he was educated at Cambridge , where he published a volume of poems ,— that he practised at the bar , and that he died in 1656 , in his twenty-ninth year . One specimen of John 's verses we shall quote :—</p>

     <p>John 's more celebrated namesake , Joseph , was born at Bristowe Park , parish of Ashby-de-la-Zouch , Leicestershire , in 1574 . He studied and took orders at Cambridge . He acted for some time as master of the school of Tiverton , in Devonshire . It is said that the accidental preaching of a sermon before Prince Henry first attracted attention to this eminent divine . Promotion followed with a sure and steady course . He was chosen to accompany King James to Scotland as one of his chaplains , and subsequently attended the famous Synod of Dort as a representative of the English Church . He had before this , while quite a young man , ( in 1597 ,) published , under the title of ‘ Virgidemiarum , ’ his Satires . In the year 1600 he produced a satirical fiction , entitled , ‘ Mundus alter et idem ; ’ in which , while pretending to describe a certain terra australis incognita , he hits hard at the existent evils of the actual world . Hall was subsequently created Bishop of Exeter , where he exposed himself to obloquy by his mildness to the Puritans . ‘ Had , ’ Campbell justly remarked , ‘ such conduct been , at this critical period , pursued by the High Churchmen in general , the history of a bloody age might have been changed into that of peace ; but the violence of Laud prevailed over the milder counsels of a Hall , an Usher , and a Corbet . ’ Yet Hall was a zealous Episcopalian , and defended that form of government in a variety of pamphlets . In the course of this controversy he carne in collision with the mighty Milton himself , who , unable to deny the ability and learning of his opponent , tried to cover him with a deluge of derision .</p>
     <p>Besides these pamphlets , the Bishop produced a number of Epistles in prose , of Sermons , of Paraphrases , and a remarkable series of ‘ Occasional Meditations , ’ which became soon , and continue to be , popular .</p>
     <p>Hall , who had in his early days struggled hard with narrow circumstances and neglect , seemed to reach the climax of prosperity when he was , in 1641 , created by the King Bishop of Norwich . But having , soon after , unfortunately added his name to the Protest of the twelve prelates against the authority of any laws which should be passed during their compulsory absence from Parliament , he was thrown into the Tower , and subsequently threatened with sequestration . After enduring great privations , he at last was permitted to retire to Higham , near Norwich , where , reduced to a very miserable allowance , he continued to labour as a pastor , with unwearied assiduity , till , in 1656 , death closed his eyes , at the advanced age of eighty-two . Bishop Hall , if not fully competent to mate with Milton , was nevertheless a giant , conspicuous even in an age when giants were rife . He has been called the Christian Seneca , from the pith and clear sententiousness of his prose style . His ‘ Meditations , ’ ranging over almost the whole compass of Scripture , as well as an incredible variety of ordinary topics , are distinguished by their fertile fancy , their glowing language , and by thought which , if seldom profound , is never commonplace , and seems always the spontaneous and easy outcome of the author 's mind . In no form of composition does excellence depend more on spontaneity than in the meditation . The ruin of such writers as Hervey , and , to some extent , Boyle , has been , that they seem to have set themselves elaborately and convulsively to extract sentiment out of every object which met their eye . They seem to say , ‘ We will , and we must meditate , whether the objects be interesting or not , and whether our own moods be propitious to the exercise , or the reverse . ’ Hence have come exaggeration , extravagance , and that shape of the ridiculous which mimics the sublime , and has been so admirably exposed in Swift 's ‘ Meditation on a Broomstick . ’ Hall 's method is , in general , the opposite of this . The objects on which he muses seem to have sought him , and not he them . He surrounds himself with his thoughts unconsciously , as one gathers burs and other herbage about him by the mere act of walking in the woods . Sometimes , indeed , he is quaint and fantastic , as in his meditation</p>

      <head>‘ UPON THE SIGHT OF TWO SNAILS . ’</head>
      <head>‘ There is much variety even in creatures of the same kind . See these two snails : one hath a house , the other wants it ; yet both are snails , and it is a question whether case is the better ; that which hath a house hath more shelter , but that which wants it hath more freedom ; the privilege of that cover is but a burden — you see if it hath but a stone to climb over with what stress it draws up that artificial load , and if the passage proves strait finds no entrance , whereas the empty snail makes no difference of way . Surely it is always an ease and sometimes a happiness to have nothing . No man is so worthy of envy as he that can be cheerful in want . ’</head>
       <l n="1">In a very different style he discourses</l>
     </lg>
     <p>‘ UPON HEARING OF MUSIC BY NIGHT . ’</p>
     <p>‘ How sweetly doth this music sound in this dead season ! In the daytime it would not , it could not so much affect the ear . All harmonious sounds are advanced by a silent darkness : thus it is with the glad tidings of salvation . The gospel never sounds so sweet as in the night of preservation or of our own private affliction — it is ever the same , the difference is in our disposition to receive it . O God , whose praise it is to give songs in the night , make my prosperity conscionable and my crosses cheerful ! ’</p>
     <p>Hall fulfilled one test of lofty genius : he was in several departments an originator . He first gave an example of epistolary composition in prose ,— an example the imitation of which has produced many of the most interesting , instructive , and beautiful writings in the language . He is our first popular author of Meditations and Contemplations , and a large school has followed in his path — too often , in truth , passibus iniquis . And he is unquestionably the father of British satire . It is remarkable that all his satires were written in youth . Too often the satirical spirit grows in authors with the advance of life ; and it is a pitiful sight , that of those who have passed the meridian of years and reputation , grinning back in helpless mockery and toothless laughter upon the brilliant way they have traversed , but to which they can return no more . Hall , on the other hand , exhausted long ere he was thirty the sarcastic material that was in him ; and during the rest of his career , wielded his powers with as much lenity as strength .</p>
     <p>Perhaps no satirist had a more thorough conception than our author of what is the real mission of satire in the moral history of mankind ; — that is , to shew vice its own image — to scourge impudent imposture — to expose hypocrisy — to laugh down solemn quackery of every kind — to create blushes on brazen brows and fears of scorn in hollow hearts — to make iniquity , as ashamed , hide its face — to apply caustic , nay cautery , to the sores of society — and to destroy sin by shewing both the ridicule which attaches to its progress and the wretched consequences which are its end . But various causes prevented him from fully realising his own ideal , and thus becoming the best as well as the first of our satirical poets . His style — imitated from Persius and Juvenal — is too elliptical , and it becomes true of him as well as of Persius that his points are often sheathed through the remoteness of his allusions and the perplexity of his diction . He is very recondite in his images , and you are sometimes reminded of one storming in English at a Hindoo — it is pointless fury , boltless thunder . At other times the stream of his satiric vein flows on with a blended clearness and energy , which has commanded the warm encomium of Campbell , and which prompted the diligent study of Pope . There is more courage required in attacking the follies than the vices of an age , and Hall shews a peculiar daring when he derides the vulgar forms of astrology and alchymy which were then prevalent , and the wretched fustian which infected the language both of literature and the stage . Whatever be the merits or defects of Hall 's satires , the world is indebted to him as the founder of a school which were itself sufficient to cover British literature with glory , and which , in the course of ages , has included such writers as Samuel Butler , with his keen sense of the grotesque and ridiculous — his wit , unequalled in its abundance and point — his vast assortment of ludicrous fancies and language — and his form of versification , seemingly shaped by the Genius of Satire for his own purposes , and resembling heroic rhyme broken off in the middle by shouts of laughter ;— Dryden , with the ease , the animus , and the masterly force of his satirical dissections — the vein of humour which is stealthily visible at times in the intervals of his wrathful mood — and the occasional passing and profound touches , worthy of Juvenal , and reminding one of the fires of Egypt , which ran along the ground , scorching all things while they pursued their unabated speed ;— the spirit of satire , strong as death , and cruel as the grave , which became incarnate in Swift ;— Pope , with his minute and microscopic vision of human infirmities , his polish , delicate strokes , damning hints , and annihilating whispers , where ‘ more is meant than meets the ear ; ’ — Johnson , with his crushing contempt and sacrificial dignity of scorn ; — Cowper , with the tenderness of a lover combined in his verse with the terrible indignation of an ancient prophet ;— Wolcot , with his infinite fund of coarse wit and humour ;— Burns , with that strange mixture of jaw and genius — the spirit of a caird with that of a poet — which marked all his satirical pieces ;— Crabbe , with his caustic vein and sternly-literal descriptions , behind which are seen , half-skulking from view , kindness , pity , and love ;— Byron , with the clever Billingsgate of his earlier , and the more than Swiftian ferocity of his later satires ;— and Moore , with the smartness , sparkle , tiny splendour , and minikin speed of his witty shafts . In comparison with even these masters of the art , the good Bishop does not dwindle ; and he challenges precedence over most of them in the purpose , tact , and good sense which blend with the whole of his satiric poetry .</p>

     <p>RICHARD LOVELACE .</p>
     <p>This unlucky cavalier and bard was born in 1618 . He was the son of Sir William Lovelace , of Woolwich , in Kent . He was educated some say at Oxford , and others at Cambridge — took a master 's degree , and was afterwards presented at Court . Anthony Wood thus describes his personal appearance at the age of sixteen :— ‘ He was the most amiable and beautiful person that eye ever beheld ,— a person also of innate modesty , virtue , and courtly deportment , which made him then , but especially after when he retired to the great city , much admired and adored by the fair sex . ’ Soon after this , he was chosen by the county of Kent to deliver a petition from the inhabitants to the House of Commons , praying them to restore the King to his rights , and to settle the government . Such offence was given by this to the Long Parliament , that Lovelace was thrown into prison , and only liberated on heavy bail . His paternal estate , which amounted to £ 500 a-year , was soon exhausted in his efforts to promote the royal cause . In 1646 , he formed a regiment for the service of the King of France , became its colonel , and was wounded at Dunkirk . Ere leaving England , he had formed a strong attachment to a Miss Lucy Sacheverell , and had written much poetry in her praise , designating her as Lux-Casta . Unfortunately , hearing a report that Lovelace had died at Dunkirk of his wounds , she married another , so that , on his return home in 1648 , he met a deep disappointment ; and to complete his misery , the ruling powers cast him again into prison , where he lay till the death of Charles . Like some other men of genius , he beguiled his confinement by literary employment ; and in 1649 , he published a book under the title of ‘ Lucasta , ’ consisting of odes , sonnets , songs , and miscellaneous poems , most of which had been previously composed . After the execution of the King , he was liberated ; but his funds were exhausted , his heart broken , and his constitution probably injured . He gradually sunk ; and Wood says that he became very poor in body and purse , was the object of charity , ‘ went in ragged clothes , and mostly lodged in obscure and dirty places . ’ Alas for the Adonis of sixteen , the beloved of Lucasta , and the envied of all ! Some have doubted these stories about his extreme poverty ; and one of his biographers asserts , that his daughter and sole heir ( but who , pray , was his wife and her mother ? ) married the son of Lord Chief-Justice Coke , and brought to her husband the estates of her father at Kingsdown , in Kent . Aubrey however , corroborates the statements of Wood ; and , at all events , Lovelace seems to have died , in 1658 , in a wretched alley near Shoe Lane .</p>
     <p>There is not much to be said about his poetry . It may be compared to his person — beautiful , but dressed in a stiff mode . We do not , in every point , homologate the opinions of Prynne , as to the ‘ unloveliness of love-locks ; ’ but we do certainly look with a mixture of contempt and pity on the self-imposed trammels of affectation in style and manner which bound many of the poets of that period . The wits of Charles II . were more disgustingly licentious ; but their very carelessness saved them from the conceits of their predecessors ; and , while lowering the tone of morality , they raised unwittingly the standard of taste . Some of the songs of Lovelace , however , such as ‘ To Althea , from Prison , ’ are exquisitely simple , as well as pure . Sir Egerton Brydges has found out that Byron , in one of his be-praised paradoxical beauties , either copied , or coincided with , our poet . In the ‘ Bride of Abydos ’ he says of Zuleika —</p>
     <p>‘ The mind , the music breathing from her face . ’</p>

     <p>While many have praised , others have called this idea nonsense ; although , if we are permitted to speak of the harmony of the tones of a cloud , why not of the harmony produced by the consenting lines of a countenance , where every grace melts into another , and the various features and expressions fluctuate into a fine whole ?

      <head>ROBERT HERRICK .</head>
      <head>This poet — a bird with tropical plumage , and norland sweetness of song — was born in Cheapside , London , in 1591 . His father , was an eminent goldsmith . Herrick was sent to Cambridge ; and having entered into holy orders , and being patronised by the Earl of Exeter , he was , in 1629 , presented by Charles I. to the vicarage of Dean Prior , in Devonshire . Here he resided for twenty years , till ejected by the civil war . He seems all this time to have felt little relish either for his profession or parishioners . In the former , the cast of his poems shews that he must have been ‘ detained before the Lord ; ’ and the latter he describes as a ‘ wild , amphibious race , ’ rude almost as ‘ salvages , ’ and ‘ churlish as the seas . ’ When he quitted his charge , he became an author at the mature age of fifty-six — publishing first , in 1647 , his ‘ Noble Numbers ; or , Pious Pieces ; ’ and next , in 1648 , his ‘ Hesperides ; or , Works both Human and Divine of Robert Herrick , Esq . ’ — his ministerial prefix being now laid aside . Some of these poems were sufficiently unclerical — being wild and licentious in cast — although he himself alleges that his life was , sexually at least , blameless . Till the Restoration he lived in Westminster , supported by the rich among the Royalists , and keeping company with the popular dramatists and poets . It would seem that he had been in the habit of visiting London previously , while still acting as a clergyman , and had become a boon companion of Ben Jonson . Hence his well-known lines —</head>
       <l n="1">‘ Ah , Ben !</l>
       <l n="2">Say how or when</l>
       <l n="3">Shall we , thy guests ,</l>
       <l n="4">Meet at those lyric feasts ,</l>
       <l n="5">Made at the “ Sun , ”</l>
       <l n="6">The “ Dog , ” the “ Triple Tun , ”</l>
       <l n="7">Where we such clusters had</l>
       <l n="8">As made us nobly wild , not mad ?</l>
       <l n="9">And yet each verse of thine</l>
       <l n="10">Outdid the meat , outdid the frolic wine .</l>
       <l n="11">My Ben !</l>
       <l n="12">Or come again ,</l>
       <l n="13">Or send to us ,</l>
       <l n="14">Thy wit 's great overplus .</l>
       <l n="15">But teach us yet</l>
       <l n="16">Wisely to husband it ;</l>
       <l n="17">Lest we that talent spend ,</l>
       <l n="18">And having once brought to an end</l>
       <l n="19">That precious stock , the store</l>
       <l n="20">Of such a wit , the world should have no more . ’</l>
     </lg>
     <p>With the Restoration , fortune began again to smile on our poet . He was replaced in his old charge , and seems to have spent the rest of his life quietly in the country , enjoying the fresh air and the old English sports — ‘ repenting at leisure moments , ’ as Shakspeare has it , of the early pruriencies of his muse ; or , as the same immortal bard says of Falstaff , ‘ patching up his old body ’ for a better place . The date of his death is not exactly ascertained ; but he seems to have got considerably to the shady side of seventy years of age .</p>
     <p>Herrick 's poetry was for a long time little known , till worthy Nathan Drake , in his ‘ Literary Hours , ’ performed to him , as to some others , the part of a friendly resurrectionist . He may be called the English Anacreon , and resembles the Greek poet , not only in graceful , lively , and voluptuous elegance and richness , but also in that deeper sentiment which often underlies the lighter surface of his verse . It is a great mistake to suppose that Anacreon was a mere contented sensualist and shallow songster of love and wine . Some of his odes shew that , if he yielded to the destiny of being a Cicada , singing amidst the vines of Bacchus , it was despair — the despair produced by a degraded age and a bad religion — which reduced him to the necessity . He was by nature an eagle ; but he was an eagle in a sky where there was no sun . The cry of a noble being , placed in the most untoward circumstances , is here and there heard in his verses , and reminds you of the voice of one of the transmuted victims of Circe , or of Ariel from that cloven pine , where he</p>
     <p>‘ howl 'd away twelve winters . ’</p>
     <p>Herrick might be by constitution a voluptuary ,— and he has unquestionably degraded his genius in not a few of his rhymes ,— but in him , as well as in Anacreon , Horace , and Burns , there lay a better and a higher nature , which the critics have ignored , because it has not found a frequent or full utterance in his poetry . In proof that our author possessed profound sentiment , mingling and sometimes half-lost in the loose , luxuriant leafage of his imagery , we need only refer our readers to his ‘ Blossoms ’ and his ‘ Daffodils . ’ Besides gaiety and gracefulness , his verse is exceedingly musical — his lines not only move but dance .</p>

      <head>SIR RICHARD FANSHAWE .</head>
      <head>This gallant knight was son to Sir Henry Fanshawe , who was Remembrancer to the Irish Exchequer , and brother to Thomas Lord Fanshawe . He was born at Ware , in Hertfordshire , in 1607-8 . He became a vehement Royalist , and acted for some time as Secretary to Prince Rupert , and was , in truth , a kindred spirit , worthy of recording the orders of that fiery spirit — the Murat of the Royal cause — to whom the dust of the mêlée of battle was the very breath of life . After the Restoration , Fanshawe was appointed ambassador to Spain and Portugal . He acted in this capacity at Madrid in 1666 . He had issued translations of the ‘ Lusiad ’ of Camoens , and the ‘ Pastor Fido ’ of Guarini . Along with the latter , which appeared in 1648 , he published some original poems of considerable merit . He holds altogether a respectable , if not a very high place among our early translators and minor poets .</head>

     <p>ABRAHAM COWLEY .</p>
     <p>The ‘ melancholy ’ and musical Cowley was born in London in the year 1618 . He was the posthumous son of a worthy grocer , who lived in Fleet Street , near the end of Chancery Lane , and who is supposed , from the omission of his name in the register of St Dunstan 's parish , to have been a Dissenter . His mother was left poor , but had a strong desire for her son 's education , and influence to get him admitted as a king 's scholar into Westminster . His mind was almost preternaturally precocious , and received early a strong and peculiar stimulus . A copy of Spenser lay in the window of his mother 's apartment , and in it he delighted to read , and became the devoted slave of poetry ever after . When only ten he wrote ‘ The Tragical History of Pyramus and Thisbe , ’ and at twelve ‘ Constantia and Philetus . ’ Pope wrote a lampoon about the same age as Cowley these romantic narratives ; and we have seen a pretty good copy of verses on Napoleon , written at the age of seven , by one of the most distinguished rising poets of our own day . When fifteen ( Johnson calls it thirteen , but he and some other biographers were misled by the portrait of the poet being , by mistake , marked thirteen ) Cowley published some of his early effusions , under the title of ‘ Poetical Blossoms . ’ While at school he produced a comedy of a pastoral kind , entitled , ‘ Love 's Riddle , ’ but it was not published till he went to Cambridge . To that university he proceeded in 1636 , and two years after , there appeared the above-mentioned comedy , with a poetical dedication to Sir Kenelm Digby , one of the marvellous men of that age ; and also ‘ Naufragium Joculare , ’ a comedy in Latin , inscribed to Dr Comber , master of the college . When the Prince of Wales afterwards visited Cambridge , the fertile Cowley got up the rough draft of another comedy , called ‘ The Guardian , ’ which was repeated to His Royal Highness by the scholars . This was afterwards , to the poet 's great annoyance , printed during his absence from the country . In 1643 he took his degree of A. M ., and was , the same year , through the prevailing influence of the Parliament , ejected , with many others , from Cambridge . He took refuge in St John 's College , Oxford , where he published a satire , entitled ‘ The Puritan and Papist , ’ and where , by his loyalty and genius , he gained the favour of such distinguished courtiers as Lord Falkland . During this agitated period he resided a good deal in the family of the Lord St Albans ; and when Oxford fell into the hands of the Parliament he followed the Queen to Paris , and there acted as Secretary to the same noble lord . He remained abroad about ten years , and during that period made various journeys in the furtherance of the Royal cause , visiting Flanders , Holland , Jersey , Scotland , &amp; c. His chief employment , however , was carrying on a correspondence in cipher between the King and the Queen . Sprat says , ‘ he ciphered and deciphered with his own hand the greatest part of the letters that passed between their Majesties , and managed a vast intelligence in other parts , which , for some years together , took up all his days and two or three nights every week . ’ This does not seem employment very suitable to a man of genius . He seems , however , to have found time for more congenial avocations ; and , in 1647 , he published his ‘ Mistress , ’ a work which seems to glow with amorous fire , although Barnes relates of the author that he was never in love but once , and then had not resolution to reveal his passion . And yet he wrote ‘ The Chronicle , ’ from which we might infer that his heart was completely tinder , and that his series of love attachments had been an infinite one !</p>
     <p>In 1556 , being of no more use in Paris , Cowley was sent back to England , that ‘ under pretence of privacy and retirement he might take occasion of giving notice of the posture of things in this nation . ’ For some time he lay concealed in London , but was at length seized by mistake for another gentleman of the Royal party ; and being thus discovered , he was continued in confinement , was several times examined , and ultimately succeeded , although with some difficulty , in obtaining his liberation , Dr Scarborough becoming his bail for a thousand pounds . In the same year he published a collection of his poems , with a querulous preface , in which he expresses a strong desire to ‘ retire to some of the American plantations , and to forsake the world for ever . ’ Meanwhile he gave himself out as a physician till the death of Cromwell , when he returned to France , resumed his former occupation , and remained till the Restoration . In 1657 he was created Doctor of Medicine at Oxford . Having studied botany to qualify himself for his physician 's degree , he was induced to publish in Latin some books on plants , flowers , and trees .</p>
     <p>The Restoration brought him less advantage than he had anticipated . Probably he expected too much , and had expressed his sanguine hopes in a song of triumph on the occasion . He had been promised , both by Charles I. and Charles II ., the Mastership of the Savoy , ( a forgotten sinecure office ;) but lost it , says Wood , ‘ by certain persons , enemies to the Muses . ’ He brought on the stage at this time his old comedy of ‘ The Guardian , ’ under the title of ‘ Cutter of Coleman Street ; ’ but it was thought a satire on the debauchery of the King 's party , and was received with coldness . Cowley , according to Dryden , ‘ received the news of his ill success not with so much firmness as might have been expected from so great a man . ’ There are few who , like Dr Johnson , have been able to declare , after the rejection of a play or poem , that they felt ‘ like the Monument . ’ Cowley not only entertained , but printed his dissatisfaction , in the form of a poem called ‘ The Complaint , ’ which , like all selfish complaints , attracted little sympathy or attention . In this he calls himself the ‘ melancholy Cowley , ’ an epithet which has stuck to his memory .</p>
     <p>He had always , according to his own statement , loved retirement . When he was a young boy at school , instead of running about on holidays , and playing with his fellows , he was wont to steal from them , and walk into the fields alone with a book . This passion had been overlaid , but not extinguished , during his public life ; and now , swelled by disgust , it came back upon him in great strength . He seems , too , if we can believe Sprat , to have had an extraordinary attachment to Nature , as it ‘ was God 's ; ’ to the whole ‘ compass of the creation , and all the wonderful effects of the Divine wisdom . ’ At all events , he retired first to Barn Elms , and then to Chertsey in Surrey . He had obtained , through Lord St Albans and the Duke of Buckingham , the lease of some lands belonging to the Queen , which brought him in an income of £ 300 a year . Here , then , having , at the age of forty-two , reached the peaceful hermitage , ’ he set himself with all his might to enjoy it . He cultivated his fields , and renewed his botanical studies in his woods and garden . He wrote letters to his friends , which are said to have been admirable , and might have ranked with those of Gray and Cowper , but unfortunately they have not been preserved . He renewed his intimacy with the Greek and Latin poets , and he set himself to retouch the ‘ Davideis , ’ which he had begun in early youth , but which he never lived to finish , and to compose his beautiful prose essays . But he soon found that Chertsey , no more than Paris , was Paradise . He had no wife nor children . He had sweet solitude , but no one near him to whom to whisper ‘ how sweet this solitude is ! ’ The peasants were boors . His tenants would pay him no rent , and the cattle of his neighbours devoured his meadows . He was troubled with rheums and colds . He met a severe fall when he first came to Chertsey , of which he says , half in jest and half in earnest — ‘ What this signifies , or may come to in time , God knows ; if it be ominous , it can end in nothing less than hanging . ’ Robert Hall said of Bishop Watson that he seemed to have wedded political integrity in early life , and to have spent all the rest of his days in quarrelling with his wife . So Cowley wedded his long - sought-for bride , Solitude , and led a miserable life with her ever after . Fortunately for him , if not for the world , his career soon came to a close .</p>
     <p>One hot day in summer , he stayed too long among his labourers in the meadows , and was seized with a cold , which , being neglected , carried him off on the 28th of July 1667 . He was not forty-nine years old . He died at the Porch House , Chertsey , and his remains were buried with great pomp near Chaucer and Spenser ; and King Charles , who had neglected him during life , pronounced his panegyric after death , declaring that ‘ Mr Cowley had not left behind him a better man in England . ’ It was in keeping with the character of Charles to make up for his deficiency in action , by his felicity of phrase .</p>
     <p>If we may differ from such a high authority as ‘ Old Rowley , ’ we would venture to doubt whether Cowley was the best — certainly he was not the greatest — man then in England . Milton was alive , and the ‘ Paradise Lost ’ appeared in the very year when the author of the ‘ Davideis ’ departed . Cowley gives us the impression of having been an amiable and blameless , rather than a good or great man . At all events , there was nothing active in his goodness , and his greatness could not be called magnanimity . He was a scholar and a poet misplaced during early life ; and when he gained that retirement for which he sighed , he had , by his habits of life , lost his capacity of relishing it . ‘ He that would enjoy solitude , ’ it has been said , ‘ must either be a wild beast or a god ; ’ and Cowley was neither . How different his grounds of dissatisfaction with the world from those of Milton ! Cowley was wearied of ciphering , and his ‘ Cutter of Coleman Street ’ had been cut ; that was nearly the whole matter of his complaint ; while Milton had fallen from being the second man in England into poverty , blindness , contempt , danger , and the disappointment of the most glorious hopes which ever heaved the bosom of patriot or saint .</p>
     <p>We find the want of greatness which marked the man characterising the poet . Infinite ingenuity , a charming flexibility and abundance of fancy , a perception of remote analogies almost unrivalled , great command of versification and language , learning without bounds , and an occasional gracefulness and sparkling ease ( as in ‘ The Chronicle ’ ) superior to even Herrick or Suckling , are qualities that must be conceded to Cowley . But the most of his writings are cold and glittering as the sun-smitten glacier . He is seldom warm , except when he is proclaiming his own merits , or bewailing his own misfortunes . Hence his ‘ Wish , ’ and even his ‘ Complaint , ’ are very pleasing and natural specimens of poetry . But his ‘ Pindaric Odes , ’ his ‘ Hymn to Light , ’ and most of his ‘ Davideis , ’ while displaying great power , shew at least equal perversion , and are more memorable for their faults than for their beauties . In the ‘ Davideis , ’ he describes the attire of Gabriel in the spirit and language of a tailor ; and there is no path so sacred or so lofty but he must sow it with conceits ,— forced , false , and chilly . His ‘ Anacreontics , ’ on the other hand , are in general felicitous in style and aerial in motion . And in his Translations , although too free , he is uniformly graceful and spirited ; and his vast command of language and imagery enables him often to improve his author — to gild the refined gold , to paint the lily , and to throw a new perfume on the violet , of the Grecian and Roman masters .</p>
     <p>In prose , Cowley is uniformly excellent . The prefaces to his poems , especially his defence of sacred song in the prefix to the ‘ Davideis , ’ his short autobiography , the fragments of his letters which remain , and his posthumous essays , are all distinguished by a rich simplicity of style and by a copiousness of matter which excite in equal measure delight and surprise . He had written , it appears , three books on the Civil War , to the time of the battle of Newbury , which he destroyed . It is a pity , perhaps , that he had not preserved and completed the work . His intimacy with many of the leading characters and the secret springs of that remarkable period ,— his clear and solid judgment , always so except when he was following the Daedalus Pindar upon waxen Icarian wings , or competing with Dr Donne in the number of conceits which he could stuff , like cloves , into his subject-matter ,— and the bewitching ease and elegance of his prose style , would have combined to render it an important contribution to English history , and a worthy monument of its author 's highly-accomplished and diversified powers .</p>

       <l n="21">With all the better trees which erst had stood</l>
       <l n="22">Unmoved , forsook their native wood .</l>
       <l n="23">The laurel to the poet 's hand did bow ,</l>
       <l n="24">Craving the honour of his brow ;</l>
       <l n="25">And every loving arm embraced , and made</l>
       <l n="26">With their officious leaves a shade .</l>
       <l n="27">The beasts , too , strove his auditors to be ,</l>
       <l n="28">Forgetting their old tyranny .</l>
       <l n="29">The fearful hart next to the lion came ,</l>
       <l n="30">And wolf was shepherd to the lamb .</l>
       <l n="31">Nightingales , harmless Syrens of the air ,</l>
       <l n="32">And Muses of the place , were there ;</l>
       <l n="33">Who , when their little windpipes they had found</l>
       <l n="34">Unequal to so strange a sound ,</l>
       <l n="35">O'ercome by art and grief , they did expire ,</l>
       <l n="36">And fell upon the conquering lyre .</l>
       <l n="37">Happy , oh happy they ! whose tomb might be ,</l>
       <l n="38">Mausolus ! envied by thee !</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">But now the early birds began to call</l>
       <l n="2">The morning forth ; up rose the sun and Saul :</l>
       <l n="3">Both , as men thought , rose fresh from sweet repose ;</l>
       <l n="4">But both , alas ! from restless labours rose :</l>
       <l n="5">For in Saul 's breast Envy , the toilsome sin ,</l>
       <l n="6">Had all that night active and tyrannous been :</l>
       <l n="7">She expelled all forms of kindness , virtue , grace ,</l>
       <l n="8">Of the past day no footstep left , or trace ;</l>
       <l n="9">The new-blown sparks of his old rage appear ,</l>
       <l n="10">Nor could his love dwell longer with his fear .</l>
       <l n="11">So near a storm wise David would not stay ,</l>
       <l n="12">Nor trust the glittering of a faithless day :</l>
       <l n="13">He saw the sun call in his beams apace ,</l>
       <l n="14">And angry clouds march up into their place :</l>
       <l n="15">The sea itself smooths his rough brow awhile ,</l>
       <l n="16">Flatt'ring the greedy merchant with a smile ;</l>
       <l n="17">But he whose shipwrecked bark it drank before ,</l>
       <l n="18">Sees the deceit , and knows it would have more .</l>
       <l n="19">Such is the sea , and such was Saul ;</l>
       <l n="20">But Jonathan his son , and only good ,</l>
       <l n="21">Was gentle as fair Jordan 's useful flood ;</l>
       <l n="22">Whose innocent stream , as it in silence goes ,</l>
       <l n="23">Fresh honours and a sudden spring bestows</l>
       <l n="24">On both his banks , to every flower and tree ;</l>
       <l n="25">The manner how lies hid , the effect we see :</l>
       <l n="26">But more than all , more than himself , he loved</l>
       <l n="27">The man whose worth his father 's hatred moved ;</l>
       <l n="28">For when the noble youth at Dammin stood ,</l>
       <l n="29">Adorned with sweat , and painted gay with blood ,</l>
       <l n="30">Jonathan pierced him through with greedy eye ,</l>
       <l n="31">And understood the future majesty</l>
       <l n="32">Then destined in the glories of his look :</l>
       <l n="33">He saw , and straight was with amazement strook ,</l>
       <l n="34">To see the strength , the feature , and the grace</l>
       <l n="35">Of his young limbs ; he saw his comely face ,</l>
       <l n="36">Where love and reverence so well-mingled were ,</l>
       <l n="37">And head , already crowned with golden hair :</l>
       <l n="38">He saw what mildness his bold sp'rit did tame ,</l>
       <l n="39">Gentler than light , yet powerful as a flame :</l>
       <l n="40">He saw his valour by their safety proved ;</l>
       <l n="41">He saw all this , and as he saw , he loved .</l>

       <l n="42">What art thou , Love ! thou great mysterious thing ?</l>
       <l n="43">From what hid stock does thy strange nature spring ?</l>
       <l n="44">‘ Tis thou that movst the world through every part ,</l>
       <l n="45">And holdst the vast frame close , that nothing start</l>
       <l n="46">From the due place and office first ordained ;</l>
       <l n="47">By thee were all things made , and are sustained .</l>
       <l n="48">Sometimes we see thee fully , and can say</l>
       <l n="49">From hence thou tookst thy rise , and wentst that way ;</l>
       <l n="50">But oftener the short beams of Reason 's eye</l>
       <l n="51">See only there thou art , not how , nor why .</l>
       <l n="52">How is the loadstone , Nature 's subtle pride ,</l>
       <l n="53">By the rude iron woo 'd , and made a bride ?</l>
       <l n="54">How was the weapon wounded ? what hid flame</l>
       <l n="55">The strong and conquering metal overcame ?</l>
       <l n="56">Love ( this world 's grace ) exalts his natural state ;</l>
       <l n="57">He feels thee , Love ! and feels no more his weight .</l>
       <l n="58">Ye learned heads whom ivy garlands grace ,</l>
       <l n="59">Why does that twining plant the oak embrace ?</l>
       <l n="60">The oak , for courtship most of all unfit ,</l>
       <l n="61">And rough as are the winds that fight with it .</l>
       <l n="62">How does the absent pole the needle move ?</l>
       <l n="63">How does his cold and ice beget hot love ?</l>
       <l n="64">Which are the wings of lightness to ascend ?</l>
       <l n="65">Or why does weight to the centre downwards bend ?</l>
       <l n="66">Thus creatures void of life obey thy laws ,</l>
       <l n="67">And seldom we , they never , know the cause .</l>
       <l n="68">In thy large state , life gives the next degree ,</l>
       <l n="69">Where sense and good apparent places thee ;</l>
       <l n="70">But thy chief palace is man 's heart alone ;</l>
       <l n="71">Here are thy triumphs and full glories shown :</l>
       <l n="72">Handsome desires , and rest , about thee flee ,</l>
       <l n="73">Union , inheritance , zeal , and ecstasy ,</l>
       <l n="74">With thousand joys , cluster around thine head ,</l>
       <l n="75">O'er which a gall-less dove her wings does spread :</l>
       <l n="76">A gentle lamb , purer and whiter far</l>
       <l n="77">Than consciences of thine own martyrs are ,</l>
       <l n="78">Lies at thy feet ; and thy right hand does hold</l>
       <l n="79">The mystic sceptre of a cross of gold .</l>
       <l n="80">Thus dost thou sit ( like men , ere sin had framed</l>
       <l n="81">A guilty blush ) naked , but not ashamed .</l>
       <l n="82">What cause , then , did the fab'lous ancients find ,</l>
       <l n="83">When first their superstition made thee blind ?</l>
       <l n="84">‘ Twas they , alas ! ‘ twas they who could not see ,</l>
       <l n="85">When they mistook that monster , Lust , for thee .</l>
       <l n="86">Thou art a bright , but not consuming , flame ;</l>
       <l n="87">Such in the amazed bush to Moses came ,</l>
       <l n="88">When that , secure , its new-crown 'd head did rear ,</l>
       <l n="89">And chid the trembling branches ’ needless fear ;</l>
       <l n="90">Thy darts are healthful gold , and downwards fall ,</l>
       <l n="91">Soft as the feathers that they are fletched withal .</l>
       <l n="92">Such , and no other , were those secret darts</l>
       <l n="93">Which sweetly touched this noblest pair of hearts :</l>
       <l n="94">Still to one end they both so justly drew ,</l>
       <l n="95">As courteous doves together yoked would do :</l>
       <l n="96">No weight of birth did on one side prevail ;</l>
       <l n="97">Two twins less even lie in Nature 's scale :</l>
       <l n="98">They mingled fates , and both in each did share ;</l>
       <l n="99">They both were servants , they both princes were .</l>
       <l n="100">If any joy to one of them was sent ,</l>
       <l n="101">It was most his to whom it least was meant ;</l>
       <l n="102">And Fortune 's malice betwixt both was cross 'd ,</l>
       <l n="103">For striking one , it wounded the other most .</l>
       <l n="104">Never did marriage such true union find ,</l>
       <l n="105">Or men 's desires with so glad violence bind ;</l>
       <l n="106">For there is still some tincture left of sin ,</l>
       <l n="107">And still the sex will needs be stealing in .</l>
       <l n="108">Those joys are full of dross , and thicker far ;</l>
       <l n="109">These , without matter , clear and liquid are .</l>
       <l n="110">Such sacred love does heaven 's bright spirits fill ,</l>
       <l n="111">Where love is but to understand and will ,</l>
       <l n="112">With swift and unseen motions such as we</l>
       <l n="113">Somewhat express in heighten 'd charity .</l>
       <l n="114">O ye bless 'd One ! whose love on earth became</l>
       <l n="115">So pure , that still in heaven ‘ tis but the same !</l>
       <l n="116">There now ye sit , and with mix 'd souls embrace ,</l>
       <l n="117">Gazing upon great Love 's mysterious face ,</l>
       <l n="118">And pity this base world , where friendship 's made</l>
       <l n="119">A bait for sin , or else at best a trade .</l>
       <l n="120">Ah , wondrous prince ! who a true friend couldst be</l>
       <l n="121">When a crown flatter 'd , and Saul threaten 'd thee !</l>
       <l n="122">Who held'st him dear whose stars thy birth did cross ,</l>
       <l n="123">And bought'st him nobly at a kingdom 's loss !</l>
       <l n="124">Israel 's bright sceptre far less glory brings ,</l>

     <p>GEORGE WITHER</p>
     <p>This remarkable man was born in Hampshire , at Bentworth , near Alton , in 1588 . He was sent to Magdalene College , Oxford , but had hardly been there till his father remanded him home to hold the plough — a reversal of the case of Cincinnatus which did not please the aspiring spirit of our poet . He took an early opportunity of breaking loose from this occupation , and of going to London with the romantic intention of making his fortune at Court . Finding that to rise at Court , flattery was indispensable , and determined not to flatter , he , in 1613 , published his ‘ Abuses Whipt and Stript , ’ for which he was committed for some months to the Marshalsea . Here he wrote his beautiful poem , ‘ The Shepherd 's Hunting ; ’ and is said to have gained his manumission by a satire to the King , in which he defends his former writings . Soon after his liberation , he published his ‘ Hymns and Songs of the Church , ’ a book which embroiled him with the clergy , but procured him the favour of King James , who encouraged him to finish a translation of the Psalms . He travelled to the court of the Queen of Bohemia , ( James 's daughter ,) in fulfilment of a vow , and presented her with a copy of his completed translation .</p>
     <p>In 1639 , he was a captain of horse in the expedition against the Scotch . When the Civil War broke out , he sold his estate to raise a troop of horse on the Parliamentary side , and soon after was made a major . In 1642 , he was appointed captain and commander of Farnham Castle , in Surrey ; but owing to some neglect or cowardice on his part , it was ceded the same year to Sir William Waller . He was made prisoner by the Royalists some time after this , and would have been put to death had not Denham interfered , alleging that as long as Wither survived , he ( Denham ) could not be accounted the worst poet in England . He was afterwards appointed Cromwell 's major-general of all the horse and foot in the county of Surrey . He made money at this time by Royalist sequestrations , but lost it all at the Restoration . He had , on the death of Cromwell , hailed Richard with enthusiasm , and predicted him a happy reign ; which makes Campbell remark , ‘ He never but once in his life foreboded good , and in that prophecy he was mistaken . ’ Wither was by no means pleased with the loss of his fortune , and remonstrated bitterly ; but for so doing he was thrown into prison again . Here his mind continued as active as ever , and he poured out treatises , poems , and satires — sometimes , when pen and ink were denied him , inscribing his thoughts with red ochre upon a trencher . After three years , he was , in 1663 , released from Newgate , under bond for good behaviour ; and four years afterwards he died in London . This was on the 2d of May 1667 . He was buried between the east door and the south end of the Savoy church , in the Strand .</p>
     <p>Wither was a man of real genius , but seems to have been partially insane . His political zeal was a frenzy ; and his religion was deeply tinged with puritanic gloom . His ‘ Collection of Emblems ’ never became so popular as those of Quarles , and are now nearly as much forgotten as his satires , his psalms , and his controversial treatises . But his early poems are delightful — full of elegant and playful fancy , ease of language , and delicacy of sentiment . Some passages in ‘ The Shepherd 's Hunting , ’ and in the ‘ Address to Poetry , ’ resemble the style of Milton in his ‘ L'Allegro ’ and ‘ Penseroso . ’ His ‘ Christmas ’ catches the full spirit of that joyous carnival of Christian England . Altogether , it is refreshing to turn from the gnarled oak of Wither 's struggling and unhappy life , to the beautiful flowers , nodding over it , of his poesy .</p>

       <l n="6">To pollute the sun 's bright beams ,</l>
       <l n="7">And yet vanish into air ,</l>
       <l n="8">Leaving it unblemished , fair ?</l>

       <l n="10">With Detraction 's breath and thee :</l>
       <l n="11">It shall never rise so high</l>

       <l n="18">‘ Twixt men 's judgments and her light ;</l>
       <l n="19">But so much her power may do</l>
       <l n="20">That she can dissolve them too .</l>
       <l n="21">If thy verse do bravely tower ,</l>
       <l n="22">As she makes wing , she gets power !</l>
       <l n="23">Yet the higher she doth soar ,</l>

       <l n="25">Till she to the high'st hath past ,</l>
       <l n="26">Then she rests with Fame at last .</l>
       <l n="27">Let nought therefore thee affright ,</l>

       <l n="30">To the very stars I 'd climb ;</l>
       <l n="31">There begin again , and fly</l>
       <l n="32">Till I reached eternity .</l>
       <l n="33">But , alas ! my Muse is slow ;</l>
       <l n="34">For thy pace she flags too low .</l>
       <l n="35">Yes , the more 's her hapless fate ,</l>
       <l n="36">Her short wings were clipped of late ;</l>
       <l n="37">And poor I , her fortune ruing ,</l>
       <l n="38">Am myself put up a-muing .</l>
       <l n="39">But if I my cage can rid ,</l>
       <l n="40">I 'll fly where I never did .</l>
       <l n="41">And though for her sake I 'm cross 'd ,</l>
       <l n="42">Though my best hopes I have lost ,</l>
       <l n="43">And knew she would make my trouble</l>
       <l n="44">Ten times more than ten times double ;</l>
       <l n="45">I would love and keep her too ,</l>
       <l n="46">Spite of all the world could do .</l>
       <l n="47">For though banished from my flocks ,</l>
       <l n="48">And confined within these rocks ,</l>
       <l n="49">Here I waste away the light ,</l>
       <l n="50">And consume the sullen night ;</l>
       <l n="51">She doth for my comfort stay ,</l>
       <l n="52">And keeps many cares away .</l>
       <l n="53">Though I miss the flowery fields ,</l>
       <l n="54">With those sweets the springtide yields ;</l>
       <l n="55">Though I may not see those groves ,</l>
       <l n="56">Where the shepherds chant their loves ,</l>
       <l n="57">And the lasses more excel</l>
       <l n="58">Than the sweet-voiced Philomel ;</l>
       <l n="59">Though of all those pleasures past ,</l>
       <l n="60">Nothing now remains at last ,</l>
       <l n="61">But remembrance , poor relief ,</l>

       <l n="72">Be her fairest ornaments .</l>
       <l n="73">In my former days of bliss ,</l>

       <l n="79">By the murmur of a spring ,</l>
       <l n="80">Or the least bough 's rustling ;</l>

       <l n="82">Shut when Titan goes to bed ;</l>
       <l n="83">Or a shady bush or tree ,</l>
       <l n="84">She could more infuse in me ,</l>
       <l n="85">Than all Nature 's beauties can ,</l>
       <l n="86">In some other wiser man .</l>
       <l n="87">By her help I also now</l>
       <l n="88">Make this churlish place allow</l>
       <l n="89">Some things that may sweeten gladness</l>
       <l n="90">In the very gall of sadness :</l>
       <l n="91">The dull loneness , the black shade</l>
       <l n="92">That these hanging vaults have made ,</l>
       <l n="93">The strange music of the waves ,</l>
       <l n="94">Beating on these hollow caves ,</l>

       <l n="1">My friends , I will ; you know I am a swain ,</l>
       <l n="2">That keep a poor flock here upon this plain :</l>
       <l n="3">Who , though it seems I could do nothing less ,</l>
       <l n="4">Can make a song , and woo a shepherdess ;</l>
       <l n="5">And not alone the fairest where I live</l>
       <l n="6">Have heard me sing , and favours deigned to give ;</l>
       <l n="7">But though I say't , the noblest nymph of Thame ,</l>
       <l n="8">Hath graced my verse unto my greater fame .</l>
       <l n="9">Yet being young , and not much seeking praise ,</l>
       <l n="10">I was not noted out for shepherds ’ lays ,</l>
       <l n="11">Nor feeding flocks , as you know others be :</l>
       <l n="12">For the delight that most possessed me</l>
       <l n="13">Was hunting foxes , wolves , and beasts of prey ;</l>
       <l n="14">That spoil our folds , and bear our lambs away .</l>
       <l n="15">For this , as also for the love I bear</l>
       <l n="16">Unto my country , I laid by all care</l>
       <l n="17">Of gain , or of preferment , with desire</l>
       <l n="18">Only to keep that state I had entire ,</l>
       <l n="19">And like a true-grown huntsman sought to speed</l>
       <l n="20">Myself with hounds of rare and choicest breed ,</l>
       <l n="21">Whose names and natures ere I further go ,</l>
       <l n="22">Because you are my friends , I 'll let you know .</l>
       <l n="23">My first esteemed dog that I did find ,</l>
       <l n="24">Was by descent of old Actaeon 's kind ;</l>
       <l n="25">A brach , which if I do not aim amiss ,</l>
       <l n="26">For all the world is just like one of his :</l>
       <l n="27">She 's named Love , and scarce yet knows her duty ;</l>
       <l n="28">Her dam 's my lady 's pretty beagle Beauty ,</l>
       <l n="29">I bred her up myself with wondrous charge ,</l>
       <l n="30">Until she grew to be exceeding large ,</l>
       <l n="31">And waxed so wanton that I did abhor it ,</l>
       <l n="32">And put her out amongst my neighbours for it .</l>
       <l n="33">The next is Lust , a hound that 's kept abroad ,</l>
       <l n="34">‘ Mongst some of mine acquaintance , but a toad</l>
       <l n="35">Is not more loathsome : ‘ tis a cur will range</l>
       <l n="36">Extremely , and is ever full of mange ;</l>
       <l n="37">And ‘ cause it is infectious , she 's not wont</l>
       <l n="38">To come among the rest , but when they hunt .</l>
       <l n="39">Hate is the third , a hound both deep and long .</l>
       <l n="40">His sire is true or else supposed Wrong .</l>
       <l n="41">He 'll have a snap at all that pass him by ,</l>
       <l n="42">And yet pursues his game most eagerly .</l>
       <l n="43">With him goes Envy coupled , a lean cur ,</l>
       <l n="44">And she 'll hold out , hunt we ne'er so far :</l>
       <l n="45">She pineth much , and feedeth little too ,</l>
       <l n="46">Yet stands and snarleth at the rest that do .</l>
       <l n="47">Then there 's Revenge , a wondrous deep-mouthed dog ,</l>
       <l n="48">So fleet , I 'm fain to hunt him with a clog ,</l>
       <l n="49">Yet many times he 'll much outstrip his bounds ,</l>
       <l n="50">And hunts not closely with the other hounds :</l>
       <l n="51">He 'll venture on a lion in his ire ;</l>
       <l n="52">Curst Choler was his dam , and Wrong his sire .</l>
       <l n="53">This Choler is a brach that 's very old ,</l>
       <l n="54">And spends her mouth too much to have it hold :</l>
       <l n="55">She 's very testy , an unpleasing cur ,</l>
       <l n="56">That bites the very stones , if they but stur :</l>
       <l n="57">Or when that ought but her displeasure moves ,</l>
       <l n="58">She 'll bite and snap at any one she loves :</l>
       <l n="59">But my quick-scented'st dog is Jealousy ,</l>
       <l n="60">The truest of this breed 's in Italy :</l>
       <l n="61">The dam of mine would hardly fill a glove ,</l>
       <l n="62">It was a lady 's little dog , called Love :</l>
       <l n="63">The sire , a poor deformed cur , named Fear ,</l>
       <l n="64">As shagged and as rough as is a bear :</l>
       <l n="65">And yet the whelp turned after neither kind ,</l>
       <l n="66">For he is very large , and near-hand blind ;</l>
       <l n="67">At the first sight he hath a pretty colour ,</l>
       <l n="68">But doth not seem so , when you view him fuller ;</l>
       <l n="69">A vile suspicious beast , his looks are bad ,</l>
       <l n="70">And I do fear in time he will grow mad .</l>
       <l n="71">To him I couple Avarice , still poor ;</l>
       <l n="72">Yet she devours as much as twenty more :</l>
       <l n="73">A thousand horse she in her paunch can put ,</l>
       <l n="74">Yet whine as if she had an empty gut :</l>
       <l n="75">And having gorged what might a land have found ,</l>
       <l n="76">She 'll catch for more , and hide it in the ground .</l>
       <l n="77">Ambition is a hound as greedy full ;</l>
       <l n="78">But he for all the daintiest bits doth cull :</l>
       <l n="79">He scorns to lick up crumbs beneath the table ,</l>
       <l n="80">He 'll fetch ‘ t from boards and shelves , if he be able :</l>
       <l n="81">Nay , he can climb if need be ; and for that ,</l>
       <l n="82">With him I hunt the martin and the cat :</l>
       <l n="83">And yet sometimes in mounting he 's so quick ,</l>
       <l n="84">He fetches falls are like to break his neck .</l>
       <l n="85">Fear is well-mouth 'd , but subject to distrust ;</l>
       <l n="86">A stranger cannot make him take a crust :</l>
       <l n="87">A little thing will soon his courage quail ,</l>
       <l n="88">And ‘ twixt his legs he ever claps his tail ;</l>
       <l n="89">With him Despair now often coupled goes ,</l>
       <l n="90">Which by his roaring mouth each huntsman knows .</l>
       <l n="91">None hath a better mind unto the game ,</l>
       <l n="92">But he gives off , and always seemeth lame .</l>
       <l n="93">My bloodhound Cruelty , as swift as wind ,</l>
       <l n="94">Hunts to the death , and never comes behind ;</l>
       <l n="95">Who but she 's strapp 'd and muzzled too withal ,</l>
       <l n="96">Would eat her fellows , and the prey and all ;</l>
       <l n="97">And yet she cares not much for any food ,</l>
       <l n="98">Unless it be the purest harmless blood .</l>
       <l n="99">All these are kept abroad at charge of many ,</l>
       <l n="100">They do not cost me in a year a penny .</l>
       <l n="101">But there 's two couple of a middling size ,</l>
       <l n="102">That seldom pass the sight of my own eyes .</l>
       <l n="103">Hope , on whose head I 've laid my life to pawn ;</l>
       <l n="104">Compassion , that on every one will fawn .</l>
       <l n="105">This would , when ‘ twas a whelp , with rabbits play</l>
       <l n="106">Or lambs , and let them go unhurt away :</l>
       <l n="107">Nay , now she is of growth , she 'll now and then</l>
       <l n="108">Catch you a hare , and let her go again .</l>
       <l n="109">The two last , Joy and Sorrow , ‘ tis a wonder ,</l>
       <l n="110">Can ne'er agree , nor ne'er bide far asunder .</l>
       <l n="111">Joy 's ever wanton , and no order knows :</l>
       <l n="112">She 'll run at larks , or stand and bark at crows .</l>
       <l n="113">Sorrow goes by her , and ne'er moves his eye ;</l>
       <l n="114">Yet both do serve to help make up the cry .</l>
       <l n="115">Then comes behind all these to bear the base ,</l>
       <l n="116">Two couple more of a far larger race ,</l>
       <l n="117">Such wide-mouth 'd trollops , that ‘ twould do you good</l>
       <l n="118">To hear their loud loud echoes tear the wood .</l>
       <l n="119">There 's Vanity , who , by her gaudy hide ,</l>
       <l n="120">May far away from all the rest be spied ,</l>
       <l n="121">Though huge , yet quick , for she 's now here , now there ;</l>
       <l n="122">Nay , look about you , and she 's everywhere :</l>
       <l n="123">Yet ever with the rest , and still in chase .</l>
       <l n="124">Right so , Inconstancy fills every place ;</l>
       <l n="125">And yet so strange a fickle-natured hound ,</l>
       <l n="126">Look for her , and she 's nowhere to be found .</l>
       <l n="127">Weakness is no fair dog unto the eye ,</l>
       <l n="128">And yet she hath her proper quality ;</l>
       <l n="129">But there 's Presumption , when he heat hath got ,</l>
       <l n="130">He drowns the thunder and the cannon-shot :</l>
       <l n="131">And when at start he his full roaring makes ,</l>
       <l n="132">The earth doth tremble , and the heaven shakes .</l>
       <l n="133">These were my dogs , ten couple just in all ,</l>
       <l n="134">Whom by the name of Satyrs I do call :</l>
       <l n="135">Mad curs they be , and I can ne'er come nigh them ,</l>
       <l n="136">But I 'm in danger to be bitten by them .</l>
       <l n="137">Much pains I took , and spent days not a few ,</l>
       <l n="138">To make them keep together , and hunt true :</l>
       <l n="139">Which yet I do suppose had never been ,</l>
       <l n="140">But that I had a scourge to keep them in .</l>
       <l n="141">Now when that I this kennel first had got ,</l>
       <l n="142">Out of my own demesnes I hunted not ,</l>
       <l n="143">Save on these downs , or among yonder rocks ,</l>
       <l n="144">After those beasts that spoiled our parish flocks ;</l>
       <l n="145">Nor during that time was I ever wont</l>
       <l n="146">With all my kennel in one day to hunt :</l>
       <l n="147">Nor had done yet , but that this other year ,</l>
       <l n="148">Some beasts of prey , that haunt the deserts here ,</l>
       <l n="149">Did not alone for many nights together</l>
       <l n="150">Devour , sometime a lamb , sometime a wether ,</l>
       <l n="151">And so disquiet many a poor man 's herd ,</l>
       <l n="152">But that of losing all they were afeard :</l>
       <l n="153">Yea , I among the rest did fare as bad ,</l>
       <l n="154">Or rather worse , for the best ewes<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>I had</l>
       <l n="155">( Whose breed should be my means of life and gain )</l>
       <l n="156">Were in one evening by these monsters slain :</l>
       <l n="157">Which mischief I resolved to repay ,</l>
       <l n="158">Or else grow desperate , and hunt all away ;</l>
       <l n="159">For in a fury ( such as you shall see</l>
       <l n="160">Huntsmen in missing of their sport will be )</l>
       <l n="161">I vowed a monster should not lurk about ,</l>
       <l n="162">In all this province , but I 'd find him out ,</l>
       <l n="163">And thereupon , without respect or care ,</l>
       <l n="164">How lame , how full , or how unfit they were ,</l>
       <l n="165">In haste unkennell 'd all my roaring crew ,</l>
       <l n="166">Who were as mad as if my mind they knew ,</l>
       <l n="167">And ere they trail 'd a flight-shot , the fierce curs</l>
       <l n="168">Had roused a hart , and thorough brakes and furs</l>
       <l n="169">Follow 'd at gaze so close , that Love and Fear</l>
       <l n="170">Got in together , so had surely there</l>
       <l n="171">Quite overthrown him , but that Hope thrust in</l>
       <l n="172">‘ Twixt both , and saved the pinching of his skin ,</l>
       <l n="173">Whereby he ‘ scaped , till coursing o'erthwart ,</l>
       <l n="174">Despair came in , and griped him to the heart :</l>

      <head>SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT ,</head>
      <head>The author of ‘ Gondibert , ’ was the son of a vintner in Oxford , and born in February 1605 . Gossip says — but says with her usual carelessness about truth — that he was the son of no less a person than William Shakspeare , who used , in his journeys between London and Stratford , to stop at the Crown , an inn kept by Davenant 's reputed father . This story is hinted at by Wood , was told to Pope by Betterton the player , and believed by Malone , but seems to be a piece of mere scandal . It is true that Davenant had a great veneration for Shakspeare , and expressed it , when only ten years old , in lines ‘ In remembrance of Master William Shakspeare , ’ beginning thus :—</head>
       <l n="1">‘ Beware , delighted poets , when you sing ,</l>
       <l n="2">To welcome nature in the early spring ,</l>
       <l n="3">Your numerous feet not tread</l>
       <l n="4">The banks of Avon , for each flower</l>
       <l n="5">( As it ne'er knew a sun or shower )</l>
       <l n="6">Hangs there the pensive head . ’</l>
     </lg>
     <p>Southey says — ‘ The father was a man of melancholy temperament , the mother handsome and lively ; and as Shakspeare used to put up at the house on his journeys between Stratford and London , Davenant is said to have affected the reputation of being Shakspeare 's son . If he really did this , there was a levity , or rather a want of feeling , in the boast , for which social pleasantry , and the spirits which are induced by wine , afford but little excuse . ’</p>
     <p>He was entered at Lincoln College ; he next became page to the Duchess of Richmond ; and we find him afterwards in the family of Fulk Greville , Lord Brooke — famous as the friend of Sir Philip Sidney . He began to write for the stage in 1628 ; and on the death of Ben Jonson he was made Poet Laureate — to the disappointment of Thomas May , so much praised by Johnson and others for his proficiency in Latin poetry , as displayed in his supplement to Lucan 's ‘ Pharsalia . ’ He became afterwards manager of Drury Lane ; but owing to his connexion with the intrigues of that unhappy period , he was imprisoned in the Tower , and subsequently made his escape to France . On his return to England , he distinguished himself greatly in the Royal cause ; and when that became desperate , he again took refuge in France , and wrote part of his ‘ Gondibert . ’ He projected a scheme for carrying over a colony to Virginia ; but his vessel was seized by one of the Parliamentary ships — he himself was conveyed a prisoner to Cowes Castle , in the Isle of Wight , and thence to the Tower , preparatory to being tried by the High Commission . But a giant hand , worthy of having saved him had he been Shakspeare 's veritable son , was now stretched forth to his rescue — the hand of Milton . In this generous act Milton was seconded by Whitelocke , and by two aldermen of York , to whom our poet had rendered some services . Liberated from the Tower , Davenant was also permitted , through the influence of Whitelocke , to open , in defiance of Puritanic prohibition , a kind of theatre at Rutland House , and by enacting his own plays there , he managed to support himself till the Restoration . He then , it is supposed , repaid to Milton his friendly service , and shielded him from the wrath of the Court . From this period Davenant continued to write for the stage — having received the patent of the Duke 's Theatre , in Lincoln 's Inn — till his death . This event took place on April 7 , 1668 . His last play , written in conjunction with Dryden , was an alteration and pollution of Shakspeare 's ‘ Tempest , ’ which was more worthy of Trincula than of the authors of ‘ Absalom and Ahithophel ’ and of ‘ Gondibert . ’ Supposing Davenant the son of Shakspeare , his act to his father 's masterpiece reminds us , in the excess of its filial impiety , of Ham 's conduct to Noah .</p>
     <p>‘ Gondibert ’ is a large and able , without being a great poem . It has the incurable and indefensible defect of dulness . ‘ The line labours , and the words move slow . ’ The story is interesting of itself , but is lost in the labyrinthine details . It has many lines , and some highly and successfully wrought passages ; but as a whole we may say of it as Porson said of certain better productions , ‘ It will be read when the works of Homer and Virgil are forgotten — but not till then . ’</p>

     <p>JOHN CHALKHILL .</p>
     <p>This author was of the age of Spenser , and is said to have been an acquaintance and friend of that poet . It was not , however , till 1683 that good old Izaak Walton published ‘ Thealma and Clearchus , ’ a pas - toral romance , which , he stated , had been written long since by John Chalkhill , Esq . He says of the author , ‘ that he was in his time a man generally known , and as well beloved ; for he was humble and obliging in his behaviour — a gentleman , a scholar , very innocent and prudent , and indeed his whole life was useful , quiet , and virtuous . ’ Some have suspected that this production proceeded from the pen of Walton himself . This , however , is rendered extremely unlikely — first , by the fact that Walton , when he printed ‘ Thealma , ’ was ninety years of age ; and , secondly , by the difference in style and purpose between that poem and Walton 's avowed productions . The mind of Walton was quietly ingenious ; that of the author of ‘ Thealma ’ is adventurous and fantastic . Walton loved ‘ the green pastures and the still waters ’ of the Present ; the other , the golden groves and ideal wildernesses of the Golden Age in the Past .</p>
     <p>‘ Thealma and Clearchus ’ may be called an ‘ Arcadia ’ in rhyme . It resembles that work of Sir Philip Sidney , not only in subject , but in execution . Its plot is dark and puzzling , its descriptions are rich to luxuriance , its narrative is tedious , and its characters are mere shadows . But although a dream , it is a dream of genius , and brings beautifully before our imagination that early period in the world 's history , in which poets and painters have taught us to believe , when the heavens were nearer , the skies clearer , the fat of the earth richer , the foam of the sea brighter , than in our degenerate days ;— when shepherds , reposing under broad , umbrageous oaks , saw , or thought they saw , in the groves the shadow of angels , and on the mountain-summits the descending footsteps of God . Chalkhill resembles , of all our modern poets , perhaps Shelley most , in the ideality of his conception , the enthusiasm of his spirit , and the unmitigated gorgeousness of his imagination .</p>

      <head>ARCADIA .</head>
       <l n="1">Arcadia , was of old , a state ,</l>
       <l n="2">Subject to none but their own laws and fate ;</l>
       <l n="3">Superior there was none , but what old age</l>
       <l n="4">And hoary hairs had raised ; the wise and sage ,</l>
       <l n="5">Whose gravity , when they are rich in years ,</l>
       <l n="6">Begat a civil reverence more than fears</l>
       <l n="7">In the well-mannered people ; at that day ,</l>
       <l n="8">All was in common , every man bare sway</l>
       <l n="9">O'er his own family ; the jars that rose</l>
       <l n="10">Were soon appeased by such grave men as those :</l>
       <l n="11">This mine and thine , that we so cavil for ,</l>
       <l n="12">Was then not heard of ; he that was most poor</l>
       <l n="13">Was rich in his content , and lived as free</l>
       <l n="14">As they whose flocks were greatest ; nor did he</l>
       <l n="15">Envy his great abundance , nor the other</l>
       <l n="16">Disdain the low condition of his brother ,</l>
       <l n="17">But lent him from his store to mend his state ,</l>
       <l n="18">And with his love he quits him , thanks his fate ;</l>
       <l n="19">And , taught by his example , seeks out such</l>
       <l n="20">As want his help , that they may do as much .</l>
       <l n="21">Their laws , e'en from their childhood , rich and poor</l>
       <l n="22">Had written in their hearts , by conning o'er</l>
       <l n="23">The legacies of good old men , whose memories</l>
       <l n="24">Outlive their monuments , the grave advice</l>
       <l n="25">They left behind in writing ;— this was that</l>
       <l n="26">That made Arcadia then so blest a state ;</l>
       <l n="27">Their wholesome laws had linked them so in one ,</l>
       <l n="28">They lived in peace and sweet communion .</l>
       <l n="29">Peace brought forth plenty , plenty bred content ,</l>
       <l n="30">And that crowned all their plans with merriment .</l>
       <l n="31">They had no foe , secure they lived in tents ,</l>
       <l n="32">All was their own they had , they paid no rents ;</l>
       <l n="33">Their sheep found clothing , earth provided food ,</l>
       <l n="34">And labour dressed them as their wills thought good ;</l>
       <l n="35">On unbought delicates their hunger fed ,</l>
       <l n="36">And for their drink the swelling clusters bled ;</l>
       <l n="37">The valleys rang with their delicious strains ,</l>
       <l n="38">And pleasure revelled on those happy plains ;</l>
       <l n="39">Content and labour gave them length of days ,</l>
       <l n="40">And peace served in delight a thousand ways .</l>

     <p>CATHARINE PHILLIPS .</p>
     <p>Very little is known of the life of this lady-poet . She was born in 1631 . Her maiden name was Fowler . She married James Phillips , Esq ., of the Priory of Cardigan . Her poems , published under the name of “ Orinda , ” were very popular in her lifetime , although it was said they were published without her consent . She translated two of the tragedies of Corneille , and left a volume of letters to Sir Charles Cotterell . These , however , did not appear till after her death . She died of small-pox — then a deadly disease — in 1664 . She seems to have been a favourite alike with the wits and the divines of her age . Jeremy Taylor addressed to her his “ Measures and Offices of Friendship ; ” Dryden praised her ; and Flatman and Cowley , besides imitating her poems while she was living , paid rhymed tributes to her memory when dead . Her verses are never commonplace , and always sensible , if they hardly attain to the measure and the stature of lofty poetry ,</p>

     <p>MARGARET , DUCHESS OF NEWCASTLE .</p>
     <p>This lady , if not more of a woman than Mrs Phillips , was considerably more of a poet . She was born ( probably ) about 1625 . She was the daughter of Sir Charles Lucas , and became a maid-of-honour to Henrietta Maria . Accompanying the Queen to France , she met with the Marquis , afterwards Duke of Newcastle , and married him at Paris in 1645 . They removed to Antwerp , and there , in 1653 , this lady published a volume , entitled ‘ Poems and Fancies . ’ The pair aided each other in their studies , and the result was a number of enormous folios of poems , plays , speeches , and philosophical disquisitions . These volumes were , we are told , great favourites of Coleridge and Charles Lamb , for the sake , we presume , of the wild sparks of insight and genius which break irresistibly through the scholastic smoke and bewildered nonsense . When Charles II . was restored , the Marquis and his wife returned to England , and spent their life in great harmony . She died in 1673 , leaving behind her some beautiful fantasias , where the meaning is often finer than the music , such as the ‘ Pastime and Recreation of Fairies in Fairy-land . ’ Her poetry , particularly her contrasted pictures of Mirth and Melancholy , present fine accumulations of imagery drawn direct from nature , and shewn now in brightest sunshine , and now in softest moonlight , as the change of her subject and her tone of feeling require .</p>

       <l n="4">Which various shadows make against the wall .</l>
       <l n="5">She loves nought else but noise which discord makes ,</l>
       <l n="6">As croaking frogs , whose dwelling is in lakes ;</l>

       <l n="9">Returning back , I in fresh pastures go ,</l>

       <l n="11">In winter cold , when nipping frosts come on ,</l>

     <p>THOMAS STANLEY .</p>
     <p>Thomas Stanley , like Thomas Brown in later days , was both a philosopher and a poet ; but his philosophical reputation at the time eclipsed his poetical . He was the only son of Sir Thomas Stanley of Camberlow Green , in Hertfordshire , and was born in 1620 . He received his education at Pembroke College , Oxford ; and after travelling for some years abroad , he took up his abode in the Middle Temple . Here he seems to have spent the rest of his life in patient and multifarious studies . He made translations of some merit from Anacreon , Bion , Moschus , and the ‘ Kisses ’ of Secundus , as well as from Marino , Boscan , Tristan , and Gongora . He wrote a work of great pretensions as a compilation , entitled ‘ The History of Philosophy , ’ containing the lives , opinions , actions , and discourses of philosophers of every sect , of which he published the first volume in 1655 , and completed it in a fourth in 1662 . It is rather a vast collection of the materials for a history , than a history itself . He is a Cudworth in magnitude and learning , but not in strength and comprehension , and is destitute of precision and clearness of style . Stanley also wrote some poems , which discover powers that might have been better employed in original composition than in translation . His style , rich of itself , is enriched to repletion by conceits , and sometimes by voluptuous sentiments and language . He adds a new flush to the cheek of Anacreon himself ; and his grapes are so heavy , that not a staff , but a wain were required to bear them . Stanley died in 1678 .</p>

     <p>ANDREW MARVELL .</p>
     <p>This noble-minded patriot and poet , the friend of Milton , the Abdiel of a dark and corrupt age ,— ‘ faithful found among the faithless , faithful only he , ’ — was born in Hull in 1620 . He was sent to Cambridge , and is said there to have nearly fallen a victim to the proselytising Jesuits , who enticed him to London . His father , however , a clergyman in Hull , went in search of and brought him back to his university , where speedily , by extensive culture and the vigorous exercise of his powerful faculties , he emancipated himself for ever from the dominion , and the danger of the dominion , of superstition and bigotry . We know little more about the early days of our poet . When only twenty , he lost his father in remarkable circumstances . In 1640 , he had embarked on the Humber in company with a youthful pair whom he was to marry at Barrow , in Lincolnshire . The weather was calm ; but Marvell , seized with a sudden presentiment of danger , threw his staff ashore , and cried out , ‘ Ho for heaven ! ’ A storm came on , and the whole company perished . In consequence of this sad event , the gentleman , whose daughter was to have been married , conceiving that the father had sacrificed his life while performing an act of friendship , adopted young Marvell as his son . Owing to this , he received a better education , and was sent abroad to travel . It is said that at Rome he met and formed a friendship with Milton , then engaged on his immortal continental tour . We find Marvell next at Constantinople , as Secretary to the English Embassy at that Court . We then lose sight of him till 1653 , when he was engaged by the Protector to superintend the education of a Mr Dutton at Eton . For a year and a half after Cromwell 's death , Marvell assisted Milton as Latin Secretary to the Protector . Our readers are all familiar with the print of Cromwell and Milton seated together at the council-table , — the one the express image of active power and rugged grandeur , the other of thoughtful majesty and ethereal grace . Marvell might have been added as a third , and become the emblem of strong English sense and incorruptible integrity . A letter of Milton 's was , not long since , discovered , dated February 1652 , in which he speaks of Marvell as fitted , by his knowledge of Latin and his experience of teaching , to be his assistant . He was not appointed , however , till 1657 . In 1660 , he became member for Hull , and was re-elected as long as he lived . He was absent , however , from England for two years , in the beginning of the reign , in Germany and Holland . After- wards he sought leave from his constituents to act as Ambassador 's Secretary to Lord Carlisle at the Northern Courts ; but from the year 1665 to his death , his attention to his parliamentary duties was unremitting . He constantly corresponded with his constituents ; and after the longest sittings , he used to write out for their use a minute account of public proceedings ere he went to bed , or took any refreshment . He was one of the last members who received pay from the town he represented ; ( 2s . a-day was probably the sum ;) and his constituents were wont , besides , to send him barrels of ale as tokens of their regard . Marvell spoke little in the House ; but his heart and vote were always in the right place . Even Prince Eupert continually consulted him , and was sometimes persuaded by him to support the popular side ; and King Charles having met him once in private , was so delighted with his wit and agreeable manners , that he thought him worth trying to bribe . He sent Lord Danby to offer him a mark of his Majesty 's consideration . Marvell , who was seated in a dingy room up several flights of stairs , declined the proffer , and , it is said , called his servant to witness that he had dined for three successive days on the same shoulder of mutton , and was not likely , therefore , to care for or need a bribe . When the Treasurer was gone , he had to send to a friend to borrow a guinea . Although , a silent senator , Marvell was a copious and popular writer . He attacked Bishop Parker for his slavish principles , in a piece entitled ‘ The Rehearsal Transposed , ’ in which he takes occasion to vindicate and panegyrise his old colleague Milton . His anonymous ‘ Account of the Growth of Arbitrary Power and Popery in England ’ excited a sensation , and a reward was offered for the apprehension of the author and printer . Marvell had many of the elements of a first-rate political pamphleteer . He had wit of a most pungent kind , great though coarse fertility of fancy , and a spirit of independence that nothing could subdue or damp . He was the undoubted ancestor of the Defoes , Swifts , Steeles , Juniuses , and Burkes , in whom this kind of authorship reached its perfection , ceased to be fugitive , and assumed classical rank .</p>
     <p>Marvell had been repeatedly threatened with assassination , and hence , when he died suddenly on the 16th of August 1678 , it was surmised that he had been removed by poison . The Corporation of Hull voted a sum to defray his funeral expenses , and for raising a monument to his memory ; but owing to the interference of the Court , through the rector of the parish , this votive tablet was not at the time erected . He was buried in St Giles-in-the-Fields .</p>
     <p>‘ Out of the strong came forth sweetness , ’ saith the Hebrew record . And so from the sturdy Andrew Marvell have proceeded such soft and lovely strains as ‘ The Emigrants , ’ ‘ The Nymph complaining for the Death of her Fawn , ’ ‘ Young Love , ’ &amp; c. The statue of Memnon became musical at the dawn ; and the stern patriot , whom no bribe could buy and no flattery melt , is found sympathising in song with a boatful of banished Englishmen in the remote Bermudas , and inditing ‘ Thoughts in a Garden , ’ from which you might suppose that he had spent his life more with melons than with men , and was better acquainted with the motions of a bee-hive than with the contests of Parliament , and the distractions of a most distracted age . It was said ( not with thorough truth ) of Milton , that he could cut out a Colossus from a rock , but could not carve heads upon cherry-stones — a task which his assistant may be said to have performed in his stead , in his small but delectable copies of verse .</p>

      <head>SATIRE ON HOLLAND .</head>
       <l n="1">Holland , that scarce deserves the name of land ,</l>
       <l n="2">As but the offscouring of the British sand ;</l>
       <l n="3">And so much earth as was contributed</l>
       <l n="4">By English pilots when they heaved the lead ;</l>
       <l n="5">Or what by the ocean 's slow alluvion fell ,</l>
       <l n="6">Of shipwrecked cockle and the mussel-shell ;</l>
       <l n="7">This indigested vomit of the sea</l>
       <l n="8">Fell to the Dutch by just propriety .</l>
       <l n="9">Glad then , as miners who have found the ore ,</l>
       <l n="10">They , with mad labour , fished the land to shore :</l>
       <l n="11">And dived as desperately for each piece</l>
       <l n="12">Of earth , as if't had been of ambergris ;</l>
       <l n="13">Collecting anxiously small loads of clay ,</l>
       <l n="14">Less than what building swallows bear away ;</l>
       <l n="15">Or than those pills which sordid beetles roll ,</l>
       <l n="16">Transfusing into them their dunghill soul .</l>
       <l n="17">How did they rivet , with gigantic piles ,</l>
       <l n="18">Thorough the centre their new-catched miles ;</l>
       <l n="19">And to the stake a struggling country bound ,</l>
       <l n="20">Where barking waves still bait the forced ground ;</l>
       <l n="21">Building their watery Babel far more high</l>
       <l n="22">To reach the sea , than those to scale the sky .</l>
       <l n="23">Yet still his claim the injured Ocean laid ,</l>
       <l n="24">And oft at leap-frog o'er their steeples played ;</l>
       <l n="25">As if on purpose it on land had come</l>
       <l n="26">To show them what 's their mare liberum .</l>
       <l n="27">A daily deluge over them does boil ;</l>
       <l n="28">The earth and water play at level-coil .</l>
       <l n="29">The fish oft-times the burgher dispossessed ,</l>
       <l n="30">And sat , not as a meat , but as a guest ;</l>
       <l n="31">And oft the Tritons , and the sea-nymphs , saw</l>
       <l n="32">Whole shoals of Dutch served up for Cabillau ;</l>

       <l n="34">For pickled herring , pickled heeren changed .</l>
       <l n="35">Nature , it seemed , ashamed of her mistake ,</l>
       <l n="36">Would throw their land away at duck and drake ,</l>
       <l n="37">Therefore necessity , that first made kings ,</l>

       <l n="46">Him they their lord , and country 's father , speak .</l>

     <p>IZAAK WALTON .</p>
     <p>This amiable enemy of the finny tribe was born in Stafford , in August 1593 . We hear of him first as settled in London , following the trade of a sempster , or linen-draper , having a shop in the Royal Burse , in Cornhill , which was ‘ seven feet and a half long , and five wide , ’ and where he became possessed of a moderate fortune . He spent his leisure time in fishing ‘ with honest Nat and R. Roe . ’ From the Royal Burse , he removed to Fleet Street , where he had ‘ one half of a shop , ’ a hosier occupying the other half . In 1632 , he married Anne , the daughter of Thomas Ken of Furnival 's Inn , and sister of Dr Ken , the celebrated Bishop of Bath and Wells . Through her and her kindred , he became acquainted with many eminent men of the day . His wife , ‘ a woman of remarkable prudence and primitive piety , ’ died long before him . He retired from business in 1643 , and lived , for forty years after , a life of leisure and quiet enjoyment , spending much of his time in the houses of his friends , and much of it by the still waters , which he so dearly loved . Walton commenced his literary career by writing a Life of Dr Donne , and followed with another of Sir Henry Wotton , prefixed to his literary remains . In 1653 appeared his ‘ Complete Angler , ’ four editions of which were called for before his decease . He wrote , in 1662 , a Life of Richard Hooker ; in 1670 , a Life of George Herbert ; and , in 1678 , a Life of Bishop Sanderson — all distinguished by naïveté and heart . In 1680 , he published an anonymous discourse on the ‘ Distempers of the Times . ’ In 1683 , he printed , as we have seen , Chalkhill 's ‘ Thealma and Clearchus ; ’ and on the 15th of December in the same year , he died at Winchester , while residing with his son-in-law , Dr Hawkins , Prebendary of Winchester Cathedral .</p>
     <p>Walton is one of the most loveable of all authors . Your admiration of him is always melting into affection . Red as his and is with the blood of fish , you pant to grasp it and press it to yours . You go with him to the fishing as you would with a bright-eyed boy , relishing his simple-hearted enthusiasm , and leaning down to listen to his precocious remarks , and to pat his curly head . It is the prevalence of the childlike element which makes Walton 's ‘ Angler ’ rank with Bunyan 's ‘ Pilgrim , ’ ‘ Robinson Crusoe , ’ and White 's ‘ Natural History of Selborne , ’ as among the most delightful books in the language . Its descriptions of nature , too , are so fresh , that you smell to them as to a green leaf . Walton would not have been at home fishing in the Forth or Clyde , or in such rivers as are found in Norway , the milk-blue Logen , or the grass - green Rauma , uniting , with its rich mediation , Romsdale Horn to the tremendous Witch-Peaks which lower on the opposite side of the valley ; — the waters of his own dear England , going softly and somewhat drowsily on their path , are the sources of his inspiration , and seem to sound like the echoes of his own subdued but gladsome spirit . Johnson defined angling as a rod with a fish at one end , and a fool at the other ; in Walton 's case , we may correct the expression to ‘ a rod with a fish at one end , and a fine old fellow — the “ ae best fellow in the world ” — at the other ’ —</p>
     <p>‘ In wit a man , simplicity a child . ’</p>
     <p>We have given a specimen of the verse he intersperses sparingly in a book which is itself a complete poem .</p>

     <p>JOHN WILMOT , EARL OF ROCHESTER</p>
     <p>We hear of the Spirit of Evil on one occasion entering into swine , but , if possible , a stranger sight is that of the Spirit of Poesy finding a similar incarnation . Certainly the connexion of genius in the Earl of Rochester with a life of the most degrading and desperate debauchery is one of the chief marvels of this marvellous world .</p>
     <p>John Wilmot was the son of Henry , Lord Rochester , and was born April 10 , 1647 , at Ditchley in Oxfordshire . He was taught grammar at the school of Burford . He then ‘ entered a nobleman ’ into Wadham College , when twelve years old , and at 1661 , when only fourteen , he was , in conjunction with some others of rank , made M. A . by Lord Clarendon in person . Pursuing his travels in France and Italy , he went in 1665 to sea with the Earl of Sandwich , and distinguished himself at Bergen in an attack on the Dutch fleet . Next year , while serving under Sir Edward Spragge , his commander sent him in the heat of an engagement with a reproof to one of his captains — a duty which Wilmot gallantly accomplished amidst a storm of shot . With this early courage some of his biographers have contrasted his subsequent reputation for cowardice , his slinking away out of street-quarrels , his refusing to fight the Duke of Buckingham , &amp; c. This diversity at different periods may perhaps be accounted for on the ground of the nervousness which continued dissipation produces , and perhaps from his poetical temperament . A poet , we are persuaded , is often the bravest , and often the most pusillanimous of men . Byron was unquestionably in general a brave , almost a pugnacious man ; and yet he confesses that at certain times , had one proceeded to horsewhip him , he would not have had the hardihood to resist . Shelley , who , in a tremendous storm , behaved with dauntless heroism , and who would at any time have acted on the example of his own character in ‘ Prometheus , ’ who , in a shipwreck ,</p>
     <p>‘ gave an enemy His plank , then plunged aside to die , ’</p>
     <p>was yet subject to paroxysms of nervous horror , which made him perspire and tremble like a spirit-seeing steed . Rochester had the same temperament , and a similar creed , with these men , although inferior to them both in morale and in genius .</p>
     <p>His character was certainly very depraved . He told Burnet on his deathbed that for five years he had not known the sensation of sobriety , having been all that time either totally drunk , or mad through the dregs of drunkenness . He on one occasion , while in this state , erected a stage on Tower Hill , and addressed the mob as a naked mountebank . Even after he became more temperate , he continued and even increased his licentiousness — one devil went out , and seven entered in . He pursued low amours in disguise ; he practised occasionally as a quack doctor ; and at other times he retired to the country , and , like Byron , amused himself by libelling all his acquaintances — every line in each libel being a lie . Notwithstanding all this , he was a favourite with Charles II ., who made him one of the gentlemen of the bedchamber , and comptroller of Woodstock Park . In his lucid intervals he recurred to his studies , wrote occasional verses , read in French Boileau and in English Cowley , and is called by Wood the best scholar among all the nobility .</p>
     <p>At last , ere he was thirty-one , the ‘ dreary old sort of feel , ’ and the ‘ rigid fibre and stiffening limbs , ’ of which Byron and Burns , when scarcely older , complained , began to assail Rochester . He had exhausted his capacity of enjoyment by excess , and had deprived himself of the consolations of religion by infidelity . His unbelief was not like Shelley 's — the growth of his own mind , and the fruit of unbridled , though earnest , speculation ;— it was merely a drug which he snatched from the laboratories of others to deaden his remorse , and enable him to look with desperate calmness to the blotted Past and the lowering Future . At this stage of his career , he became acquainted with Bishop Burnet , who has recorded his conversion and edifying end in a book which , says Johnson , ‘ the critic ought to read for its elegance , the philosopher for its arguments , and the saint for its piety . ’ To this , after Johnson 's example , we refer our readers . Eochester died July 26 , 1680 , before he had completed his thirty-fourth year . He was married , and left three daughters and a son named Charles , who did not long survive his father . With him the male line ceased , and the title was conferred on a younger son of Lord Clarendon . His poems appeared in the year of his death , professing on the title-page to be printed at Antwerp . They contain much that is spurious , but some productions that are undoubtedly Rochester 's . They are at the best , poor fragmentary exhibitions of a vigorous , but undisciplined mind . His songs are rather easy than lively . His imitations are distinguished by grace and spirit . His ‘ Nothing ’ is a tissue of clever conceits , like gaudy weeds growing on a sterile soil , but here and there contains a grand and gloomy image , such as —</p>
     <p>‘ And rebel Light obscured thy reverend dusky face . ’</p>
     <p>His ‘ Satire against Man ’ might be praised for its vigorous misanthropy , but is chiefly copied from Boileau .</p>
     <p>Rochester may be signalised as the first thoroughly depraved and vicious person , so far as we remember , who assumed the office of the satirist , — the first , although not , alas ! the last human imitator of ‘ Satan accusing Sin . ’ Some satirists before him had been faulty characters , while rather inconsistently assailing the faults of others ; but here , for the first time , was a man of no virtue , or belief in virtue whatever , ( his tenderness to his family , revealed in his letters , is just that of the tiger fondling his cubs , and seeming , perhaps , to them a ‘ much - misrepresented character , ’ ) and whose life was one mass of wounds , bruises , and putrefying sores ,— a naked satyr who gloried in his shame , — becoming a severe castigator of public morals and of private character .

     <p>THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON .</p>
     <p>Wentworth Dillon , Earl of Roscommon , was the son of James Dillon and Elizabeth Wentworth . She was the sister of the infamous Strafford , who was at once uncle and godfather to our poet . In what exact year Dillon was born is uncertain , but it was some time about 1633 . His father had been converted from Popery by Usher ; and when the Irish Rebellion broke out , Strafford , afraid of the fury of the Irish , sent for his godson , and took him to his own seat in Yorkshire , where he was taught Latin with great care . He was sent afterwards to Caen , where he studied under Bochart . It is said that while playing extravagantly there at the customary games of boys , he suddenly paused , became grave , and cried out , ‘ My father is dead , ’ and that a fortnight after arrived tidings from Ireland confirming his impression . Johnson is inclined to believe this story , and we are more than inclined . Since the lexicographer 's day , many of what used to be called his ‘ superstitions ’ have been established as certain facts , although their explanation is still shrouded in darkness . Roscommon was then only ten years of age .</p>
     <p>From Caen he travelled to Italy , where he obtained a profound knowledge of medals . At the Restoration he returned to England , where he was made Captain of the Band of Pensioners , and subsequently Master of the Horse to the Duchess of York . He became unfortunately addicted to gambling , and , through this miserable habit , he got embroiled in endless quarrels , as well as in pecuniary embarassments .</p>
     <p>Business compelled him to visit Ireland , where the Duke of Orrnond made him Captain of the Guards . On his return to England in 1662 , he married the Lady Frances , daughter of the Earl of Burlington . By her he had no issue . His second wife , whom he married in 1674 , was Isabella , daughter of Matthew Beynton of Barmister , in Yorkshire .</p>
     <p>Roscommon now began to meditate and execute literary projects . He produced an ‘ Essay on Translated Verse , ’ ( in 1681 ,) a translation of Horace 's ‘ Art of Poetry , ’ and other pieces . He projected , in conjunction with his friend Dryden , a plan for refining our language and fixing its standard , as if Time were not the great refiner , fixer , and enricher of a tongue . While busy with these schemes and occupations , the troubles of James II . ' s reign commenced . Roscommon determined to retire to Rome , saying , ‘ It is best to sit near the chimney when the chamber smokes . ’ Death , however , prevented him from reaching the beloved and desired focus of Roman Catholic darkness . He was assailed by gout , and an ignorant French empiric , whom he consulted , contrived to drive the disease into the bowels . Roscommon expired , uttering with great fervour two lines from his own translation of the ‘ Dies Irae , ’ —</p>

       <l n="3">This was in 1684 . He received a pompous interment in Westminster Abbey .</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>Roscommon does not deserve the name of a great poet . He was a man of varied accomplishments and exquisite taste rather than of genius . His ‘ Essay on Translated Verse ’ is a sound and sensible , not a profound and brilliant production . In one point he went before his age . He praises Milton 's ‘ Paradise Lost , ’ although unfortunately he selects for encomium the passage in the sixth book describing the angels fighting against each other with fire-arms — a passage which most critics have considered a blot upon the poem .</p>

      <head>CHARLES COTTON .</head>
      <head>Hearty , careless ‘ Charley Cotton ’ was born in 1630 . His father , Sir George Cotton , was improvident and intemperate in his latter days , and left the poet an encumbered estate situated at Ashbourne , in Derbyshire , near the river Dove . This place will recall the words quoted by O'Connell in Parliament in reference to the present Lord Derby :—</head>
       <l n="1">‘ Down thy fair banks , romantic Ashbourne , glides</l>
       <l n="2">The Derby dilly , with its six insides . ’</l>

     <p>Charles studied at Cambridge ; and after travelling abroad , married the daughter of Sir Thomas Owthorp in Nottinghamshire , who does not appear to have lived long . His extravagance keeping him poor , he was compelled to eke out his means by translating works from the French and Italian , including those of a spirit somewhat kindred to his own — Montaigne . At the age of forty , he obtained a captain 's commission in the army , and went to Ireland . There he met with his second wife , Mary , Countess Dowager of Ardglass , the widow of Lord Cornwall . She possessed a jointure of £ 1500 a-year , secured , however , after marriage , from her husband 's imprudent and reckless management . He returned to his English estate , where he became passionately fond of fishing ,— intimate with Izaak Walton , whom he invited in a poem , although now eighty-three years old , to visit him in the country — and where he built a fishing-house , with the initials of Izaak 's name and his own united in ciphers over the door ; the walls , too , being painted with fishing scenes , and the portraits of Cotton and Walton appearing upon the beaufet . Poor Charles had a less fortunate career than his friend , dying insolvent at Westminster in 1687 .</p>
     <p>Careless gaiety and reckless extravagance , blended with heart , sense , and sincerity , were the characteristics of Cotton as a man , and were , as is usually the case , transferred to his poetry . He squandered his pence and his powers with equal profusion . His travestie of the ‘ Aeneid ’ is pronounced by Christopher North ( who must have read it , however ,) a beastly book . Campbell says , with striking justice , of another of Cotton 's productions , ‘ His imitations of Lucian betray the grossest misconception of humorous effect , when he attempts to burlesque that which is ludicrous already . ’ It is like trying to turn the ‘ Tale of a Tub ’ into ridicule . But Cotton 's own vein , as exhibited in his ‘ Invitation to Walton , ’ his ‘ New Year , ’ and his ‘ Voyage to Ireland , ’ ( which anticipates in some measure the style of Anstey in the ‘ New Bath Guide , ’ ) is very rich and varied , full of ease , picturesque spirit , and humour , and stamps him a genuine , if not a great poet .</p>

        <l n="1">The lives of frail men are compared by the sages</l>

        <l n="4">That is , to their ends , to be plain in my matter ;</l>

        <l n="6">He has run his race , though his goal be the gallows ;</l>
        <l n="7">And this ‘ tis , I fancy , sets folks so a-madding ,</l>
        <l n="8">And makes men and women so eager of gadding ;</l>
        <l n="9">Truth is , in my youth I was one of these people</l>
        <l n="10">Would have gone a great way to have seen a high steeple ,</l>
        <l n="11">And though I was bred ‘ mongst the wonders o ’ th ’ Peak ,</l>
        <l n="12">Would have thrown away money , and ventured my neck</l>
        <l n="13">To have seen a great hill , a rock , or a cave ,</l>
        <l n="14">And thought there was nothing so pleasant and brave :</l>
        <l n="15">But at forty years old you may , if you please ,</l>
        <l n="16">Think me wiser than run such errands as these ;</l>

        <l n="22">Why , faith , it was that makes the old woman trot ;</l>

        <l n="182">With a very fine woman , and good ale and beer ;</l>
        <l n="183">When myself having stuffed than a bagpipe more full ,</l>
        <l n="184">I fell to my smoking until I grew dull ;</l>
        <l n="185">And , therefore , to take a fine nap thought it best ,</l>
        <l n="186">For when belly full is , bones would be at rest :</l>
        <l n="187">I tumbled me down on my bed like a swad ,</l>
        <l n="188">Where , oh ! the delicious dream that I had !</l>
        <l n="189">Till the bells , that had been my morning molesters ,</l>
        <l n="190">Now waked me again , chiming all in to vespers :</l>
        <l n="191">With that starting up , for my man I did whistle ,</l>
        <l n="192">And combed out and powdered my locks that were grizzle ;</l>
        <l n="193">Had my clothes neatly brushed , and then put on my sword ,</l>
        <l n="194">Resolved now to go and attend on the word .</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="11">
        <l n="195">Thus tricked , and thus trim , to set forth I begin ,</l>
        <l n="196">Neat and cleanly without , but scarce cleanly within ;</l>
        <l n="197">For why , Heaven knows it , I long time had been</l>
        <l n="198">A most humble obedient servant to sin ;</l>
        <l n="199">And now in devotion was even so proud ,</l>
        <l n="200">I scorned forsooth to join prayer with the crowd ;</l>
        <l n="201">For though courted by all the bells as I went ,</l>
        <l n="202">I was deaf , and regarded not the compliment ,</l>
        <l n="203">But to the cathedral still held on my pace ,</l>
        <l n="204">As't were , scorning to kneel but in the best place .</l>
        <l n="205">I there made myself sure of good music at least ,</l>
        <l n="206">But was something deceived , for ‘ twas none of the best :</l>
        <l n="207">But however I stay 'd at the church 's commanding</l>
        <l n="208">Till we came to the ‘ Peace passes all understanding , ’</l>
        <l n="209">Which no sooner was ended , but whir and away ,</l>
        <l n="210">Like boys in a school when they 've leave got to play ;</l>
        <l n="211">All save master mayor , who still gravely stays</l>
        <l n="212">Till the rest had made room for his worship and 's mace :</l>
        <l n="213">Then he and his brethren in order appear ,</l>
        <l n="214">I out of my stall , and fell into his rear ;</l>
        <l n="215">For why , ‘ tis much safer appearing , no doubt ,</l>
        <l n="216">In authority 's tail , than the head of a rout .</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="12">
        <l n="217">In this rev'rend order we marched from prayer ;</l>
        <l n="218">The mace before me borne as well as the mayor ;</l>
        <l n="219">Who looking behind him , and seeing most plain</l>
        <l n="220">A glorious gold belt in the rear of his train ,</l>
        <l n="221">Made such a low congé , forgetting his place ,</l>
        <l n="222">I was never so honoured before in my days :</l>
        <l n="223">But then off went my scalp-case , and down went my fist ,</l>
        <l n="224">Till the pavement , too hard , by my knuckles was kissed ;</l>
        <l n="225">By which , though thick-skulled , he must understand this ,</l>
        <l n="226">That I was a most humble servant of his ;</l>
        <l n="227">Which also so wonderful kindly he took ,</l>
        <l n="228">( As I well perceived both b ’ his gesture and look ,)</l>
        <l n="229">That to have me dogg 'd home he straightway appointed ,</l>
        <l n="230">Resolving , it seems , to be better acquainted .</l>
        <l n="231">I was scarce in my quarters , and set down on crupper ,</l>
        <l n="232">But his man was there too , to invite me to supper :</l>
        <l n="233">I start up , and after most respective fashion</l>
        <l n="234">Gave his worship much thanks for his kind invitation ;</l>
        <l n="235">But begged his excuse , for my stomach was small ,</l>
        <l n="236">And I never did eat any supper at all ;</l>
        <l n="237">But that after supper I would kiss his hands ,</l>
        <l n="238">And would come to receive his worship 's commands .</l>
        <l n="239">Sure no one will say , but a patron of slander ,</l>
        <l n="240">That this was not pretty well for a Moorlander :</l>
        <l n="241">And since on such reasons to sup I refused ,</l>
        <l n="242">I nothing did doubt to be holden excused ;</l>
        <l n="243">But my quaint repartee had his worship possess 'd</l>
        <l n="244">With so wonderful good a conceit of the rest ,</l>
        <l n="245">That with mere impatience he hoped in his breeches</l>
        <l n="246">To see the fine fellow that made such fine speeches :</l>
        <l n="247">‘ Go , sirrah ! ’ quoth he , ‘ get you to him again ,</l>
        <l n="248">And will and require , in his Majesty 's name ,</l>
        <l n="249">That he come ; and tell him , obey he were best , or</l>
        <l n="250">I 'll teach him to know that he 's now in West-Chester . ’</l>
        <l n="251">The man , upon this , comes me running again ,</l>
        <l n="252">But yet minced his message , and was not so plain ;</l>
        <l n="253">Saying to me only , ‘ Good sir , I am sorry</l>
        <l n="254">To tell you my master has sent again for you ;</l>
        <l n="255">And has such a longing to have you his guest ,</l>
        <l n="256">That I , with these ears , heard him swear and protest ,</l>
        <l n="257">He would neither say grace , nor sit down on his bum ,</l>
        <l n="258">Nor open his napkin , until you do come . ’</l>
        <l n="259">With that I perceived no excuse would avail ,</l>
        <l n="260">And , seeing there was no defence for a flail ,</l>
        <l n="261">I said I was ready master may'r to obey ,</l>
        <l n="262">And therefore desired him to lead me the way .</l>
        <l n="263">We went , and ere Malkin could well lick her ear ,</l>
        <l n="264">( For it but the next door was , forsooth ) we were there ;</l>
        <l n="265">Where lights being brought me , I mounted the stairs ,</l>
        <l n="266">The worst I e'er saw in my life at a mayor 's :</l>
        <l n="267">But everything else must be highly commended .</l>
        <l n="268">I there found his worship most nobly attended ,</l>
        <l n="269">Besides such a supper as well did convince ,</l>
        <l n="270">A may'r in his province to be a great prince ;</l>
        <l n="271">As he sat in his chair , he did not much vary ,</l>
        <l n="272">In state nor in face , from our eighth English Harry ;</l>
        <l n="273">But whether his face was swelled up with fat ,</l>
        <l n="274">Or puffed up with glory , I cannot tell that .</l>
        <l n="275">Being entered the chamber half length of a pike ,</l>
        <l n="276">And cutting of faces exceedingly like</l>
        <l n="277">One of those little gentlemen brought from the Indies ,</l>
        <l n="278">And screwing myself into congés and cringes ,</l>
        <l n="279">By then I was half-way advanced in the room ,</l>
        <l n="280">His worship most rev'rendly rose from his bum ,</l>
        <l n="281">And with the more honour to grace and to greet me ,</l>
        <l n="282">Advanced a whole step and a half for to meet me ;</l>
        <l n="283">Where leisurely doffing a hat worth a tester ,</l>
        <l n="284">He bade me most heartily welcome to Chester .</l>
        <l n="285">I thanked him in language the best I was able ,</l>
        <l n="286">And so we forthwith sat us all down to table .</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="13">
        <l n="287">Now here you must note , and ‘ tis worth observation ,</l>
        <l n="288">That as his chair at one end o ’ th ’ table had station ;</l>
        <l n="289">So sweet mistress may'ress , in just such another ,</l>
        <l n="290">Like the fair queen of hearts , sat in state at the other ;</l>
        <l n="291">By which I perceived , though it seemed a riddle ,</l>
        <l n="292">The lower end of this must be just in the middle :</l>
        <l n="293">But perhaps ‘ tis a rule there , and one that would mind it</l>
        <l n="294">Amongst the town-statutes ‘ tis likely might find it .</l>
        <l n="295">But now into the pottage each deep his spoon claps ,</l>
        <l n="296">As in truth one might safely for burning one 's chaps ,</l>
        <l n="297">When straight , with the look and the tone of a scold ,</l>
        <l n="298">Mistress may'ress complained that the pottage was cold ;</l>
        <l n="299">‘ And all ‘ long of your fiddle-faddle , ’ quoth she .</l>
        <l n="300">‘ Why , what then , Goody Two-Shoes , what if it be ?</l>
        <l n="301">Hold you , if you can , your tittle-tattle , ’ quoth he .</l>
        <l n="302">I was glad she was snapped thus , and guessed by th ’ discourse ,</l>
        <l n="303">The may'r , not the gray mare , was the better horse ,</l>
        <l n="304">And yet for all that , there is reason to fear ,</l>
        <l n="305">She submitted but out of respect to his year :</l>
        <l n="306">However ‘ twas well she had now so much grace ,</l>
        <l n="307">Though not to the man , to submit to his place ;</l>
        <l n="308">For had she proceeded , I verily thought</l>
        <l n="309">My turn would the next be , for I was in fault :</l>
        <l n="310">But this brush being past , we fell to our diet ,</l>
        <l n="311">And every one there filled his belly in quiet .</l>
        <l n="312">Supper being ended , and things away taken ,</l>
        <l n="313">Master mayor 's curiosity ‘ gan to awaken ;</l>
        <l n="314">Wherefore making me draw something nearer his chair ,</l>
        <l n="315">He willed and required me there to declare</l>
        <l n="316">My country , my birth , my estate , and my parts ,</l>
        <l n="317">And whether I was not a master of arts ;</l>
        <l n="318">And eke what the business was had brought me thither ,</l>
        <l n="319">With what I was going about now , and whither :</l>
        <l n="320">Giving me caution , no lie should escape me ,</l>
        <l n="321">For if I should trip , he should certainly trap me .</l>
        <l n="322">I answered , my country was famed Staffordshire ;</l>
        <l n="323">That in deeds , bills , and bonds , I was ever writ squire ;</l>
        <l n="324">That of land I had both sorts , some good , and some evil ,</l>
        <l n="325">But that a great part o n't was pawned to the devil ;</l>
        <l n="326">That as for my parts , they were such as he saw ;</l>
        <l n="327">That , indeed , I had a small smatt'ring of law ,</l>
        <l n="328">Which I lately had got more by practice than reading ,</l>
        <l n="329">By sitting o ’ th ’ bench , whilst others were pleading ;</l>
        <l n="330">But that arms I had ever more studied than arts ,</l>
        <l n="331">And was now to a captain raised by my deserts ;</l>
        <l n="332">That the business which led me through Palatine ground</l>
        <l n="333">Into Ireland was , whither now I was bound ;</l>
        <l n="334">Where his worship 's great favour I loud will proclaim ,</l>
        <l n="335">And in all other places wherever I came .</l>
        <l n="336">He said , as to that , I might do what I list ,</l>
        <l n="337">But that I was welcome , and gave me his fist ;</l>
        <l n="338">When having my fingers made crack with his gripes ,</l>
        <l n="339">He called to his man for some bottles and pipes .</l>

        <l n="348">When thinking it now was high time to depart ,</l>
        <l n="349">His worship I thanked with a most grateful heart ;</l>
        <l n="350">And because to great men presents are acceptable ,</l>
        <l n="351">I presented the may'r , ere I rose from the table ,</l>

        <l n="356">The sun in the morning disclosed his light ,</l>
        <l n="357">With complexion as ruddy as mine over night ;</l>
        <l n="358">And o'er th ’ eastern mountains peeping up 's head ,</l>
        <l n="359">The casement being open , espied me in bed ;</l>
        <l n="360">With his rays he so tickled my lids that I waked ,</l>
        <l n="361">And was half ashamed , for I found myself naked ;</l>
        <l n="362">But up I soon start , and was dressed in a trice ,</l>
        <l n="363">And called for a draught of ale , sugar , and spice ;</l>
        <l n="364">Which having turned off , I then call to pay ,</l>
        <l n="365">And packing my nawls , whipt to horse , and away .</l>
        <l n="366">A guide I had got , who demanded great vails ,</l>
        <l n="367">For conducting me over the mountains of Wales :</l>
        <l n="368">Twenty good shillings , which sure very large is ;</l>
        <l n="369">Yet that would not serve , but I must bear his charges ;</l>
        <l n="370">And yet for all that , rode astride on a beast ,</l>
        <l n="371">The worst that e'er went on three legs , I protest :</l>
        <l n="372">It certainly was the most ugly of jades ,</l>
        <l n="373">His hips and his rump made a right ace of spades ;</l>
        <l n="374">His sides were two ladders , well spur-galled withal ;</l>
        <l n="375">His neck was a helve , and his head was a mall ;</l>
        <l n="376">For his colour , my pains and your trouble I 'll spare ,</l>
        <l n="377">For the creature was wholly denuded of hair ;</l>
        <l n="378">And , except for two things , as bare as my nail ,</l>
        <l n="379">A tuft of a mane , and a sprig of a tail ;</l>
        <l n="380">And by these the true colour one can no more know ,</l>
        <l n="381">Than by mouse-skins above stairs , the merkin below .</l>
        <l n="382">Now such as the beast was , even such was the rider ,</l>
        <l n="383">With a head like a nutmeg , and legs like a spider ;</l>
        <l n="384">A voice like a cricket , a look like a rat ,</l>
        <l n="385">The brains of a goose , and the heart of a cat :</l>
        <l n="386">Even such was my guide and his beast ; let them pass ,</l>
        <l n="387">The one for a horse , and the other an ass .</l>
        <l n="388">But now with our horses , what sound and what rotten ,</l>
        <l n="389">Down to the shore , you must know , we were gotten ;</l>
        <l n="390">And there we were told , it concerned us to ride ,</l>
        <l n="391">Unless we did mean to encounter the tide ;</l>
        <l n="392">And then my guide lab'ring with heels and with hands ,</l>
        <l n="393">With two up and one down , hopped over the sands ,</l>
        <l n="394">Till his horse , finding the labour for three legs too sore ,</l>
        <l n="395">Foaled out a new leg , and then he had four :</l>
        <l n="396">And now by plain dint of hard spurring and whipping ,</l>
        <l n="397">Dry-shod we came where folks sometimes take shipping ;</l>
        <l n="398">And where the salt sea , as the devil were in ‘ t ,</l>
        <l n="399">Came roaring t ’ have hindered our journey to Flint ;</l>

        <l n="406">But the lord of Flint castle 's no lord worth a louse ,</l>
        <l n="407">For he keeps ne'er a drop of good drink in his house ;</l>

        <l n="409">Of such ale as , thank God , I ne'er tasted before ;</l>
        <l n="410">And surely the Welsh are not wise of their fuddle ,</l>
        <l n="411">For this had the taste and complexion of puddle .</l>
        <l n="412">From thence then we marched , full as dry as we came ,</l>
        <l n="413">My guide before prancing , his steed no more lame ,</l>

        <l n="418">I thought it the pool of Bethesda had been ,</l>
        <l n="419">By the cripples lay there ; but I went to my inn</l>
        <l n="420">To speak for some meat , for so stomach did motion ,</l>
        <l n="421">Before I did further proceed in devotion :</l>
        <l n="422">I went into th ’ kitchen , where victuals I saw ,</l>
        <l n="423">Both beef , veal , and mutton , but all on ‘ t was raw ;</l>
        <l n="424">And some o n't alive , but soon went to slaughter ,</l>
        <l n="425">For four chickens were slain by my dame and her daughter ;</l>
        <l n="426">Of which to Saint Win . ere my vows I had paid ,</l>
        <l n="427">They said I should find a rare fricasée made :</l>
        <l n="428">I thanked them , and straight to the well did repair ,</l>
        <l n="429">Where some I found cursing , and others at prayer ;</l>
        <l n="430">Some dressing , some stripping , some out and some in ,</l>
        <l n="431">Some naked , where botches and boils might be seen ;</l>
        <l n="432">Of which some were fevers of Venus I 'm sure ,</l>
        <l n="433">And therefore unfit for the virgin to cure :</l>
        <l n="434">But the fountain , in truth , is well worth the sight ,</l>

        <l n="444">The floor 's not ill paved , and the margin o ’ th ’ spring</l>

        <l n="446">From each angle of which a pillar does rise ,</l>
        <l n="447">Of strength and of thickness enough to suffice</l>
        <l n="448">To support and uphold from falling to ground</l>
        <l n="449">A cupola wherewith the virgin is crowned .</l>
        <l n="450">Now ‘ twixt the two angles that fork to the north ,</l>
        <l n="451">And where the cold nymph does her basin pour forth ,</l>
        <l n="452">Under ground is a place where they bathe , as ‘ tis said ,</l>
        <l n="453">And ‘ tis true , for I heard folks ’ teeth hack in their head ;</l>

        <l n="456">But one thing I chiefly admired in the place ,</l>
        <l n="457">That a saint and a virgin endued with such grace ,</l>

        <l n="461">Of I cannot tell how many water-mills :</l>
        <l n="462">I 've studied that point much , you cannot guess why ,</l>
        <l n="463">But the virgin was , doubtless , more righteous than I .</l>
        <l n="464">And now for my welcome , four , five , or six lasses ,</l>
        <l n="465">With as many crystalline liberal glasses ,</l>
        <l n="466">Did all importune me to drink of the water</l>
        <l n="467">Of Saint Winifreda , good Thewith 's fair daughter .</l>
        <l n="468">A while I was doubtful , and stood in a muse ,</l>
        <l n="469">Not knowing , amidst all that choice , where to choose .</l>
        <l n="470">Till a pair of black eyes , darting full in my sight ,</l>
        <l n="471">From the rest o ’ th ’ fair maidens did carry me quite ;</l>
        <l n="472">I took the glass from her , and whip , off it went ,</l>
        <l n="473">I half doubt I fancied a health to the saint :</l>
        <l n="474">But he was a great villain committed the slaughter ,</l>

        <l n="476">I slipped a hard shilling into her soft hand ,</l>
        <l n="477">Which had like to have made me the place have profaned ;</l>
        <l n="478">And giving two more to the poor that were there ,</l>

     <p>DR HENRY MORE .</p>
     <p>This eminent man was the son of a gentleman of good family and estate in Grantham , Lincolnshire . He was born in 1614 . His father sent him to study at Eton , and thence , in 1631 , he repaired to Cambridge , where he was destined to spend the most of his life . Philosophy attracted him early , in preference to science or literature , and he became a follower of Plato , so decided and enthusiastic as to gain for himself the title of ‘ The Platonist ’ par excellence . In 1639 , he graduated M. A . ; and the next year , he published the first part of ‘ Psychozoia ; or , The Song of the Soul , ’ containing a Christiano-Platonical account of Man and Life . In preparing the materials of this poem , he had studied all the principal Platonists and mystical writers , and is said to have read himself almost to a shadow . And not only was his body emaciated , but his mind was so overstrung , that he imagined himself to see spiritual beings , to hear supernatural voices , and to converse , like Socrates , with a particular genius . He thought , too , that his body ‘ exhaled the perfume of violets ! ’ Notwithstanding these little peculiarities , his genius and his learning , the simplicity of his character , and the innocence of his life , rendered him a general favourite ; he was made a fellow of his college , and became a tutor to various persons of distinguished rank . One of these was Sir John Finch , whose sister , Lady Conway , an enthusiast herself , brought More acquainted with the famous John Baptist Van Helment , a man after whom , in the beginning of the seventeenth century , the whole of Europe wondered . He was a follower and imitator of Paracelsus , like him affected universal knowledge , aspired to revolutionise the science of medicine , and died with the reputation of one who , with great powers and acquirements , instead of becoming a great man , ended as a brilliant pretender , and was rather an ‘ architect of ruin ’ to the systems of others , than the founder of a solid fabric of his own . More admired , of course , not the quackery , but the adventurous boldness of Helment 's genius , and his devotion to chemistry ; which is certainly the most spiritual of all the sciences , and must , especially in its transcendental forms , have had a great charm for a Platonic thinker . Our author was entirely devoted to study , and resisted every inducement to leave what he called his ‘ Paradise ’ at Cambridge . His friends once tried to decoy him into a bishopric , and got him the length of Whitehall to kiss the king 's hand on the occasion ; but when he understood their purpose , he refused to go a single step further . His life was a long , learned , happy , and holy dream . He was of the most benevolent disposition ; and once observed to a friend , ‘ that he was thought by some to have a soft head , but he thanked God he had a soft heart . ’ In the heat of the Rebellion , the Republicans spared More , although he had refused to take the Covenant . Campbell says of him , ‘ He corresponded with Descartes , was the friend of Cudworth , and , as a divine and a moralist , was not only popular in his own time , but has been mentioned with admiration both by Addison and Blair . ’ One is rather amused at the latter clause . That a man of More 's massive learning , noble eloquence , and divine genius should need the testimony of a mere elegant wordmonger like Blair , seems ludicrous enough ; and Addison himself , except in wit and humour , was not worthy to have untied the shoelatchets of the old Platonist . We were first introduced to this writer by good Dr John Brown , late of Broughton Place , Edinburgh , and shall never forget hearing him , in his library , read some splendid passages from More 's work , in those deep , mellow , antique tones which flavoured whatever he read , like the crust on old wine . His chief works are , ‘ A Discourse on the Immortality of the Soul , ’ ‘ The Mystery of Godliness , ’ ‘ The Mystery of Iniquity , ’ ‘ Divine Dialogues , ’ ‘ An Antidote against Atheism , ’ ‘ Ethical and Metaphysical Manuals , ’ &amp; c. In writing such books , and pursuing the recondite studies of which they were the fruit , More spent his life happily . In 1661 , he became a Fellow of the Royal Society . For twenty years after the Restoration , his works are said to have sold better than any of their day — a curious and unaccountable fact , considering the levity and licentiousness of the period . In September 1687 , the fine old spiritualist , aged seventy - three , went away to that land of ‘ ideas ’ to which his heart had been translated long before .</p>
     <p>More 's prose writings give us , on the whole , a higher idea of his powers than his poem . This is not exactly , as a recent critic calls it , ‘ dull and tedious , ’ but it is in some parts prosaic , and in others obscure . The gleams of fancy in it are genuine , but few and far between . But his prose works constitute , like those of Cudworth , Charnock , Jeremy Taylor , and John Scott , a vast old quarry , abounding both in blocks and in gems — blocks of granite solidity , and gems of starry lustre . The peculiarity of More is in that poetico-philosophic mist which , like the autumnal gossamer , hangs in light and beautiful festoons over his thoughts , and which suggests pleasing memories of Plato and the Alexandrian school . Like all the followers of the Grecian sage , he dwells in a region of ‘ ideas , ’ which are to him the only realities , and are not cold , but warm ; he sees all things in Divine solution ; the visible is lost in the invisible , and nature retires before her God . Surely they are splendid reveries those of the Platonic school ; but it is sad to reflect that they have not cast the slightest gleam of light on the dark , frightful , faith-shattering mysteries which perplex all inquirers . The old shadows of sin , death , damnation , evil , and hell , are found to darken the ‘ ideas ’ of Plato 's world quite as deeply as they do the actualities of this weary , work-day earth , into which men have , for some inscrutable purpose , been sent to be , on the whole , miserable ,— so often to toil without compen - sation , to suffer without benefit , and to hope without fulfilment .</p>

      <head>WILLIAM CHAMBERLAYNE .</head>
      <head>Chamberlayne was , during life , a poor man , and , till long after his death , an unappreciated poet . He was a physician at Shaftesbury , Dorsetshire ; born in 1619 , and died in 1689 . He appears to have been present among the Royalists at the battle of Newbury . He complains bitterly of his narrow circumstances , and yet he lived to a long age . He published , in 1658 , a tragic comedy , entitled ‘ Love 's Victory , ’ and in 1659 , ‘ Pharonnida , ’ a heroic poem .</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">The latter is the main support of his literary reputation . It was</l>

     <p>Silent , however , it continues since , and can never be expected to be thronged by visitors . The story is interesting , and many of the separate thoughts , expressions , and passages are beautiful , as , for instance —</p>

       <l n="2">That moth which frets the sacred robe of wit ; ’</l>
     </lg>
     <p>but the style is often elliptical and involved ; the story meanders too much , and is too long and intricate ; and , on the whole , a few mutilated fragments are all that are likely to remain of an original and highly elaborate poem .</p>

      <head>ARGALIA TAKEN PRISONER BY THE TURKS .</head>

       <l n="4">Wearied with toil , they are resolved to bow</l>
       <l n="5">Their stubborn resolutions with the strength</l>

       <l n="10">Circling their confines . Whilst this tedious stay</l>
       <l n="11">From battle rusts the soldier 's valour in</l>
       <l n="12">His tainted cabin , there had often been ,</l>
       <l n="13">With all variety of fortune , fought</l>
       <l n="14">Brave single combats , whose success had brought</l>
       <l n="15">Honour 's unwithered laurels on the brow</l>
       <l n="16">Of either party ; but the balance , now</l>
       <l n="17">Forced by the hand of a brave Turk , inclined</l>
       <l n="18">Wholly to them . Thrice had his valour shined</l>
       <l n="19">In victory 's refulgent rays , thrice heard</l>
       <l n="20">The shouts of conquest ; thrice on his lance appeared</l>
       <l n="21">The heads of noble Rhodians , which had struck</l>
       <l n="22">A general sorrow ‘ mongst the knights . All look</l>
       <l n="23">Who next the lists should enter ; each desires</l>

       <l n="71">The dregs of discontent . Staying to win</l>
       <l n="72">Some Rhodian castles , all the prisoners were</l>
       <l n="73">Sent with a guard into Sardinia , there</l>
       <l n="74">To meet their wretched thraldom . From the rest</l>

       <l n="77">The hell-instructed torments that could fall</l>

       <l n="82">Of suffering Christians , once , before they take</l>
       <l n="83">The ornaments of nature off , to make</l>
       <l n="84">Their prisoners public to the view , that all</l>
       <l n="85">Might mock their miseries : this sight did call</l>
       <l n="86">Janusa to her palace-window , where ,</l>
       <l n="87">Whilst she beholds them , love resolved to bear</l>
       <l n="88">Her ruin on her treacherous eye-beams , till</l>
       <l n="89">Her heart infected grew ; their orbs did fill ,</l>
       <l n="90">As the most pleasing object , with the sight</l>

     <p>HENRY VAUGHAN .</p>
     <p>Vaughan was torn in Wales , on the banks of the Uske , in Brecknockshire , in 1614 . His father was a gentleman , but , we presume , poor , as his son was bred to a profession . Young Vaughan became first a lawyer , and then a physician ; and we suppose , had it not been for his advanced life , he would have become latterly a clergyman , since he grew , when old , exceedingly devout . In life , he was not fortunate , and we find him , like Chamberlayne , complaining bitterly of the poverty of the poetical tribe . In 1651 , he published a volume of verse , in which nascent excellence struggles with dim obscurities , like a young moon with heavy clouds . But his ‘ Silex Scintillans , ’ or ‘ Sacred Poems , ’ produced in later life , attests at once the depth of his devotion , and the truth and originality of his genius . He died in 1695 .</p>
     <p>Campbell , always prone to be rather severe on pious poets , and whose taste , too , was finical at times , says of Vaughan — ‘ He is one of the harshest even of the inferior order of the school of conceit ; but he has some few scattered thoughts that meet the eye amidst his harsh pages , like wild flowers on a barren heath . ’ Surely this is rather ‘ harsh ’ judgment . At the same time , it is not a little laughable to find that Campbell has himself appropriated one of these ‘ wild flowers . ’ In his beautiful ‘ Rainbow , ’ he cries —</p>
     <lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">‘ How came the world 's gray fathers forth</l>
       <l n="2">To mark thy sacred sign ! ’</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="3">Vaughan had said —</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="4">‘ How bright wert thou , when Shem 's admiring eye ,</l>
       <l n="5">Thy burnished , flaming arch did first descry ;</l>
       <l n="6">When Terah , Nahor , Haran , Abram , Lot ,</l>
       <l n="7">The youthful world 's gray fathers in one knot ,</l>
       <l n="8">Did with intentive looks watch every hour</l>
       <l n="9">For thy new light , and trembled at each shower ! ’</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>Indeed , all Campbell 's ‘ Rainbow ’ is just a reflection of Vaughan 's , and reminds you of those faint , pale shadows of the heavenly bow you sometimes see in the darkened and disarranged skies of spring . To steal from , and then strike down the victim , is more suitable to robbers than to poets .</p>
     <p>Perhaps the best criticism on Vaughan may be found in the title of his own poems , ‘ Silex Scintillans . ’ He had a good deal of the dulness and hardness of the flint about his mind , but the influence of poverty and suffering ,— for true it is that</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">‘ Wretched men</l>
       <l n="2">Are cradled into poetry by wrong ;</l>
       <l n="3">They learn in suffering what they teach in song , ’ —</l>
     </lg>
     <p>and latterly the power of a genuine , though somewhat narrow piety , struck out glorious scintillations from the bare but rich rock . He ranks with Crashaw , Quarles , and Herbert , as one of the best of our early religious poets ; like them in their faults , and superior to all of them in refinement and beauty , if not in strength of genius .</p>

      <head>APOSTROPHE TO FLETCHER THE DRAMATIST .</head>
       <l n="1">I did believe , great Beaumont being dead ,</l>
       <l n="2">Thy widowed muse slept on his flowery bed .</l>
       <l n="3">But I am richly cozened , and can see</l>
       <l n="4">Wit transmigrates — his spirit stayed with thee ;</l>
       <l n="5">Which , doubly advantaged by thy single pen ,</l>
       <l n="6">In life and death now treads the stage again .</l>
       <l n="7">And thus are we freed from that dearth of wit</l>
       <l n="8">Which starved the land , since into schisms split ,</l>
       <l n="9">Wherein th ’ hast done so much , we must needs guess</l>
       <l n="10">Wit 's last edition is now i ’ the press .</l>
       <l n="11">For thou hast drained invention , and he</l>
       <l n="12">That writes hereafter , doth but pillage thee .</l>
       <l n="13">But thou hast plots ; and will not the Kirk strain</l>
       <l n="14">At the designs of such a tragic brain ?</l>
       <l n="15">Will they themselves think safe , when they shall see</l>
       <l n="16">Thy most abominable policy ?</l>
       <l n="17">Will not the Ears assemble , and think't fit</l>
       <l n="18">Their synod fast and pray against thy wit ?</l>
       <l n="19">But they 'll not tire in such an idle quest —</l>
       <l n="20">Thou dost but kill and circumvent in jest ;</l>
       <l n="21">And when thy angered muse swells to a blow ,</l>
       <l n="22">Tis but for Field 's or Swansteed 's overthrow .</l>
       <l n="23">Yet shall these conquests of thy bays outlive</l>
       <l n="24">Their Scottish zeal , and compacts made to grieve</l>
       <l n="25">The peace of spirits ; and when such deeds fail</l>
       <l n="26">Of their foul ends , a fair name is thy bail .</l>
       <l n="27">But , happy ! thou ne'er saw'st these storms our air</l>
       <l n="28">Teemed with , even in thy time , though seeming fair .</l>
       <l n="29">Thy gentle soul , meant for the shade and ease</l>
       <l n="30">Withdrew betimes into the land of peace .</l>
       <l n="31">So , nested in some hospitable shore ,</l>
       <l n="32">The hermit-angler , when the mid seas roar ,</l>
       <l n="33">Packs up his lines , and ere the tempest raves ,</l>
       <l n="34">Retires , and leaves his station to the waves .</l>
       <l n="35">Thus thou diedst almost with our peace ; and we ,</l>
       <l n="36">This breathing time , thy last fair issue see ,</l>
       <l n="37">Which I think such , if needless ink not soil</l>
       <l n="38">So choice a muse , others are but thy foil ;</l>
       <l n="39">This or that age may write , but never see</l>
       <l n="40">A wit that dares run parallel with thee .</l>
       <l n="41">True Ben must live ; but bate him , and thou hast</l>
       <l n="42">Undone all future wits , and matched the past .</l>

       <l n="76">Defects and darkness in my breast ;</l>
       <l n="77">Pollutions all my body wed ,</l>
       <l n="78">And even my soul to thee is dead ;</l>
       <l n="79">Only in him , on whom I feast ,</l>
       <l n="80">Both soul and body are well dressed ;</l>
       <l n="81">His pure perfection quits all score ,</l>
       <l n="82">And fills the boxes of his poor ;</l>
       <l n="83">He is the centre of long life and light ;</l>
       <l n="84">I am but finite , he is infinite .</l>

     <p>DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT .</p>
     <p>This writer , though little known , appears to us to stand as high almost as any name in the present volume , and we are proud to reprint here some considerable specimens of his magnificent poetry .</p>
     <p>Joseph Beaumont was sprung from a collateral branch of the ancient family of the Beaumonts , that family from which sprung Sir John Beaumont , the author of ‘ Bosworth Field , ’ and Francis Beaumont , the celebrated dramatist . He was born at Hadleigh , in Suffolk . Of his early life nothing is known . He received his education at Cambridge , where , during the Civil War , he was fellow and tutor of Peterhouse . Ejected by the Republicans from his offices , he retired to Hadleigh , and spent his time in the com - position of his magnum opus , ‘ Psyche . ’ This poem appeared in 1648 ; and in 1702 , three years after the author 's death , his son published a second edition , with numerous corrections , and the addition of four cantos by the author . Beaumont also wrote several minor pieces in English and Latin , a controversial tract in reply to Henry More 's ‘ Mystery of Godliness , ’ and several theological works which are still in MS ., according to a provision in his will to that effect . Peace and perpetuity to their slumbers !</p>
     <p>After the Restoration , our author was not only reinstated in his former situations , but received from his patron , Bishop Wren , several valuable pieces of preferment besides . Afterwards , he exercised successively the offices of Master of Jesus and of Peterhouse , and was King 's Professor of Divinity from 1670 to 1699 . In the latter year he died .</p>
     <p>While praising the genius of Beaumont , we are far from commending his ‘ Psyche , ’ either as an artistic whole , or as a readable book . It is , sooth to say , a dull allegory , in twenty-four immense cantos , studded with the rarest beauties . It is considerably longer than the ‘ Faery Queen , ’ nearly four times the length of the ‘ Paradise Lost , ’ and five or six times as long as the ‘ Excursion . ’ To read it through now-a-days were to perform a purgatorial penance . But the imagination and fancy are Spenserian , his colouring is often Titianesque in gorgeousness , and his pictures of shadows , abstractions , and all fantastic forms , are so forcible as to seem to start from the canvas . In painting the beautiful , his verse becomes careless and flowing as a loosened zone ; in painting the frightful and the infernal , his language , like his feeling , seems to curdle and stiffen in horror , as where , speaking of Satan , he says —</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">‘ His tawny teeth</l>
       <l n="2">Were ragged grown , by endless gnashing at</l>
       <l n="3">The dismal riddle of his living death . ’</l>
     </lg>
     <p>The ‘ Psyche ’ may be compared to a palace of Fairyland , where successive doors fly open to the visitor — one revealing a banqueting-room filled with the materials of exuberant mirth ; another , an enchanted garden , with streams stealing from grottos , and nymphs gliding through groves ; a third conducting you to a dungeon full of dead men 's bones and all uncleanness ; a fourth , to a pit which seems the mouth of hell , and whence cries of torture come up , shaking the smoke that ascendeth up for ever and ever ; and a fifth , to the open roof , over which the stars are seen bending , and the far-off heavens are opening in glory ; and of these doors there is no end . We saw , when lately in Copenhagen , the famous tower of the Trinity Church , remarkable for the grand view commanded from the summit , and for the broad spiral ascent winding within it almost to the top , up which it is said Peter the Great , in 1716 , used to drive himself and his Empress in a coach-and-four . It was curious to feel ourselves ascending on a path nearly level , and without the slightest perspiration or fatigue ; and here , we thought , is the desiderated ‘ royal road ’ to difficulties fairly found . Large poems should be constructed on the same principle ; their quiet , broad interest should beguile their readers alike to their length and their loftiness . It is exactly the reverse with ‘ Psyche . ’ But if any reader is wearied of some of the extracts we have given , such as his verses on ‘ Eve , ’ on ‘ Paradise , ’ on ‘ End , ’ on ‘ The Death of his Wife , ’ and on ‘ Imperial Rome , ’ we shall be very much disposed to question his capacity for appreciating true poetry .</p>

     <p>INDEX</p>
     <p>SPECIMENS , WITH MEMOIRS , OF THE LESS-KNOWN BRITISH POETS .</p>
     <p>THIRD PERIOD .</p>
     <p>FROM DRYDEN TO COWPER .</p>
     <p>SIR CHARLES SEDLEY .</p>
     <p>Sedley was one of those characters who exert a personal fascination over their own age without leaving any works behind them to perpetuate the charm to posterity . He was the son of Sir John Sedley of Aylesford , in Kent , and was born in 1639 . When the Restoration took place he repaired to London , and plunged into all the licence of the time , shedding , however , over the putrid pool the sheen of his wit , manners , and genius . Charles was so delighted with him , that he is said to have asked him whether he had not obtained a patent from Nature to be Apollo 's viceroy . He cracked jests , issued lampoons , wrote poems and plays , and , despite some great blunders , was universally admired and loved . When his comedy of ‘ Bellamira ’ was acted , the roof fell in , and a few , including the author , were slightly injured . When a parasite told him that the fire of the play had blown up the poet , house and all , Sedley replied , ‘ No ; the play was so heavy that it broke down the house , and buried the poet in his own rubbish . ’ Latterly he sobered down , entered parliament , attended closely to public business , and became a determined opponent of the arbitrary measures of James II . To this he was stimulated by a personal reason . James had seduced Sedley 's daughter , and made her Countess of Dorchester . ‘ For making my daughter a countess , ’ the father said , ‘ I have helped to make his daughter ’ ( Mary , Princess of Orange ,) ‘ a queen . ’ Sedley , thus talking , acting , and writing , lived on till he was sixty - two years of age . He died in 1701 .</p>
     <p>He has left nothing that the world can cherish , except such light and graceful songs , sparkling rather with point than with poetry , as we quote below .</p>

     <lg type="poem">
      <head>JOHN POMFRET ,</head>
      <head>The author of the once popular ‘ Choice , ’ was born in 1667 . He was the son of the rector of Luton , in Bedfordshire , and , after attending Queen 's College , Cambridge , himself entered the Church . He became minister of Malden , which is also situated in Bedfordshire , and there he wrote and , in 1699 , published a volume of poems , including some Pindaric essays , in the style of Cowley and ‘ The Choice . ’ He might have risen higher in his profession , but Dr Compton , Bishop of London , was prejudiced against him on account of the following lines in the ‘ Choice : ’ —</head>
       <l n="1">‘ And as I near approached the verge of life ,</l>
       <l n="2">Some kind relation ( for I 'd have no wife )</l>
       <l n="3">Should take upon him all my worldly care ,</l>
       <l n="4">Whilst I did for a better state prepare . ’</l>
     </lg>
     <p>The words in the second line , coupled with a glowing description , in a previous part of the poem , of his ideal of an ‘ obliging modest fair ’ one , near whom he wished to live , led to the suspicion that he preferred a mistress to a wife . In vain did he plead that he was actually a married man . His suit for a better living made no progress , and while dancing attendance on his patron in London he caught small-pox , and died in 1703 , in the thirty-sixth year of his age .</p>
     <p>His Pindaric odes , &amp; c ., are feeble spasms , and need not detain us . His ‘ Reason ’ shews considerable capacity and common sense . His ‘ Choice ’ opens up a pleasing vista , down which our quiet ancestors delighted to look , but by which few now can be attracted . We quote a portion of what a biographer calls a ‘ modest ’ preface , which Pomfret prefixed to his poems :— ‘ To please every one would be a new thing , and to write so as to please nobody would be as new ; for even Quarles and Withers have their admirers . It is not the multitude of applauses , but the good sense of the applauders which establishes a valuable reputation ; and if a Rymer or a Congreve say it is well , he will not be at all solicitous how great the majority be to the contrary . ’ How strangely are opinions now altered ! Rymer was some time ago characterised by Macaulay as the worst critic that ever lived , and Quarles and Withers have now many admirers , while ‘ The Choice ’ and its ill-fated author are nearly forgotten .</p>
     <lg type="poem">
      <head>THE CHOICE .</head>
       <l n="1">If Heaven the grateful liberty would give ,</l>
       <l n="2">That I might choose my method how to live ,</l>
       <l n="3">And all those hours propitious fate should lend ,</l>
       <l n="4">In blissful ease and satisfaction spend ,</l>
       <l n="5">Near some fair town I 'd have a private seat ,</l>
       <l n="6">Built uniform , not little , nor too great :</l>

     <p>THE EARL OF DORSET .</p>
     <p>This noble earl was rather a patron of poets than a poet , and possessed more wit than genius . Charles Sackville was born on the 24th January 1637 . He was descended directly from the famous Thomas , Lord Buckhurst . He was educated under a private tutor , travelled in Italy , and returned in time to witness the Restoration . In the first parliament thereafter , he sat for East Grinstead , in Surrey , and might have distinguished himself , had he not determined , in common with almost all the wits of the time , to run a preliminary career of dissipation . What a proof of the licentiousness of these times is to be found in the fact , that young Lord Buckhurst , Sir Charles Sedley , and Sir Thomas Ogle were fined for exposing themselves , drunk and naked , in indecent postures on the public street ! In 1665 , the erratic energies of Buckhurst found a more legitimate vent in the Dutch war . He attended the Duke of York in the great sea-fight of the 3d June , in which Opdam , the Dutch admiral , was , with all his crew , blown up . He is said to have composed the song , quoted afterwards , ‘ To all you ladies now at land , ’ on the evening before the battle , although Dr Johnson ( who observes that seldom any splendid story is wholly true ) maintains that its composition cost him a whole week , and that he only retouched it on that remarkable evening . Buckhurst was soon after made a gentleman of the bed-chamber , and despatched on short embassies to France . In 1674 , his uncle , James Cranfield , the Earl of Middlesex , died , and left him his estate , and the next year the title , too , was conferred on him . In 1677 , he became , by the death of his father , Earl of Dorset , and inherited the family estate . In 1684 , his wife , whose name was Bagot , and by whom he had no children , died , and he soon after married a daughter of the Earl of Northampton , who is said to have been celebrated both for understanding and beauty . Dorset was courted by James , but found it impossible to coincide with his violent measures , and when the bishops were tried at Westminster Hall , he , along with some other lords , appeared to countenance them . He concurred with the Revolution settlement , and , after William 's accession , was created lord chamberlain of the household , and received the Order of the Garter . His attendance on the king , however , eventually cost him his life , for having been tossed with him in an open boat on the coast of Holland for sixteen hours , in very rough weather , he caught an illness from which he never recovered . On 19th January 1705-6 , he died at Bath .</p>
     <p>During his life , Dorset was munificent in his kindness to such men of genius as Prior and Dryden , who repaid him in the current coin of the poor Parnassus of their day — gross adulation . He is now remembered mainly for his spirited war-song , and for such pointed lines in his satire on Edward Howard , the notorious author of ‘ British Princes , ’ as the following :—</p>

      <head>JOHN PHILIPS .</head>
      <head>Bampton in Oxfordshire was the birthplace of this poet . He was born on the 30th of December 1676 . His father , Dr Stephen Philips , was archdeacon of Salop , as well as minister of Bampton . John , after some preliminary training at home , was sent to Winchester , where he distinguished himself by diligence and good-nature , and enjoyed two great luxuries ,— the reading of Milton , and the having his head combed by some one while he sat still and in rapture for hours together . This pleasure he shared with Vossius , and with humbler persons of our acquaintance ; the combing of whose hair , they tell us ,</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">

       <l n="2">And brings all heaven before their eyes . ’</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="3">In 1694 , he entered Christ Church , Cambridge . His intention was to</l>
       <l n="4">prosecute the study of medicine , and he took great delight in the</l>
       <l n="5">cognate pursuits of natural history and botany . His chief friend was</l>
       <l n="6">Edmund Smith , ( Rag Smith , as he was generally called ,) a kind of minor</l>
       <l n="7">Savage , well known in these times as the author of ‘ Phaedra and</l>
       <l n="8">Hippolytus , ’ and for his cureless dissipation . In 1703 , Philips produced</l>
       <l n="9">‘ The Splendid Shilling , ’ which proved a hit , and seems to have diverted</l>
       <l n="10">his aspirations from the domains of Aesculapius to those of Apollo .</l>
       <l n="11">Bolingbroke sought him out , and employed him , after the battle of</l>
       <l n="12">Blenheim , to sing it in opposition to Addison , the laureate of the</l>
       <l n="13">Whigs . At the house of the magnificent but unprincipled St John , Philips</l>
       <l n="14">wrote his ‘ Blenheim , ’ which was published in 1705 . The year after , his</l>
       <l n="15">‘ Cider , ’ a poem in two books , appeared , and was received with great</l>
       <l n="16">applause . Encouraged by this , he projected a poem on the Last Day ,</l>
       <l n="17">which all who are aware of the difficulties of the subject , and the</l>
       <l n="18">limitations of the author 's genius , must rejoice that he never wrote .</l>
       <l n="19">Consumption and asthma removed him prematurely on the 15th of February</l>
       <l n="20">1708 , ere he had completed his thirty-third year . He was buried in</l>
       <l n="21">Hereford Cathedral , and Sir Simon Harcourt , afterwards Lord Chancellor ,</l>
       <l n="22">erected a monument to his memory in Westminster Abbey .</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>Bulwer somewhere records a story of John Martin in his early days . He was , on one occasion , reduced to his last shilling . He had kept it , out of a heap , from a partiality to its appearance . It was very bright . He was compelled , at last , to part with it . He went out to a baker 's shop to purchase a loaf with his favourite shilling . He had got the loaf into his hands , when the baker discovered that the shilling was a bad one , and poor Martin had to resign the loaf , and take back his dear , bright , bad shilling once more . Length of time and cold criticism in like manner have reduced John Philips to his solitary ‘ Splendid Shilling . ’ But , though bright , it is far from bad . It is one of the cleverest of parodies , and is perpetrated against one of those colossal works which the smiles of a thousand caricatures were unable to injure . No great or good poem was ever hurt by its parody :— the ‘ Paradise Lost ’ was not by ‘ The Splendid Shilling ’ — ‘ The Last Man ’ of Campbell was not by ‘ The Last Man ’ of Hood — nor the ‘ Lines on the Burial of Sir John Moore ’ by their witty , well-known caricature ; and if ‘ The Vision of Judgment ’ by Southey was laughed into oblivion by Byron 's poem with the same title , it was because Southey 's original was neither good nor great . Philip 's poem , too , is the first of the kind ; and surely we should be thankful to the author of the earliest effort in a style which has created so much innocent amusement . Dr Johnson speaks as if the pleasure arising from such productions implied a malignant ‘ momentary triumph over that grandeur which had hitherto held its captives in admiration . ’ We think , on the contrary , that it springs from our deep interest in the original production , making us alive to the strange resemblance the caricature bears to it . It is our love that provokes our laughter , and hence the admirers of the parodied poem are more delighted than its enemies . At all events , it is by ‘ The Splendid Shilling ’ alone — and that principally from its connexion with Milton 's great work — that Philips is memorable . His ‘ Cider ’ has soured with age , and the loud echo of his Blenheim battle-piece has long since died away .</p>

     <p>We may here mention a name or two of poets from whose verses we can afford no extracts ,— such as Walsh , called by Pope ‘ knowing Walsh , ’ a man of some critical discernment , if not of much genius ; Gould , a domestic of the Earl of Dorset , and afterwards a schoolmaster , from whom Campbell quotes one or two tolerable songs ; and Dr Walter Pope , a man of wit and knowledge , who was junior proctor of Oxford , one of the first chosen fellows of the Royal Society , and who succeeded Sir Christopher Wren as professor of astronomy in Gresham College . He is the author of a comico-serious song of some merit , entitled ‘ The Old Man 's Wish . ’</p>
     <p>SIR SAMUEL GARTH .</p>
     <p>Of Garth little is known , save that he was an eminent physician , a scholar , a man of benevolence , a keen Whig , and yet an admirer of old Dryden , and a patron of young Pope — a friend of Addison , and the author of the ‘ Dispensary . ’ The College of Physicians had instituted a dispensary , for the purpose of furnishing the poor with medicines gratis . This measure was opposed by the apothecaries , who had an obvious interest in the sale of drugs ; and to ridicule their selfishness Garth wrote his poem , which is mock-heroic , in six cantos , copied in form from the ‘ Lutrin , ’ and which , though ingenious and elaborate , seems now tedious , and on the whole uninteresting . It appeared in 1696 , and the author died in 1718 . We extract some of the opening lines of the first canto of the poem .</p>

     <p>SIR RICHARD BLACKMORE .</p>
     <p>Our next name is that of one who , like the former , was a knight , a physician , and ( in a manner ) a poet . Blackmore was the son of Robert Blackmore of Corsham , in Wiltshire , who is styled by Wood gentleman , and is believed to have been an attorney . He took his degree of M. A . at Oxford , in June 1676 . He afterwards travelled , was made Doctor of Physic at Padua , and , when he returned home , began to practise in London with great success . In 1695 , he tried his hand at poetry , producing an epic entitled ‘ King Arthur , ’ which was followed by a series on ‘ King Alfred , ’ ‘ Queen Elizabeth , ’ ‘ Redemption , ’ ‘ The Creation , ’ &amp; c. Some of these productions were popular ; one , ‘ The Creation , ’ has been highly praised by Dr Johnson ; but most of them were heavy . Matthew Henry has preserved portions in his valuable Commentary . Blackmore , a man of excellent character and of extensive medical practice , was yet the laughingstock of the wits , perhaps as much for his piety as for his prosiness . Old , rich , and highly respected , he died on the 8th of October 1729 , while some of his poetic persecutors came to a disgraceful or an early end .</p>
     <p>We quote the satire of John Gay , as one of the cleverest and best conditioned , although one of the coarsest of the attacks made on poor Sir Richard :—</p>

     <p>ELIJAH FENTON .</p>
     <p>This author , who was very much respected by his contemporaries , and who translated a portion of the Odyssey in conjunction with Pope , was born May 20 , 1683 , at Newcastle , in Staffordshire ; studied at Cambridge , which , owing to his nonjuring principles , he had to leave without a degree ; and passed part of his life as a schoolmaster , and part of it as secretary to Charles , Earl of Orrery . By his tragedy of ‘ Mariamne ’ he secured a moderate competence ; and during his latter years , spent his life comfortably as tutor in the house of Lady Trumbull . He died in 1730 . His accomplishments were superior , and his character excellent . Pope , who was indebted to him for the first , fourth , nineteenth , and twentieth of the books of the Odyssey , mourns his loss in one of his most sincere-seeming letters . Fenton edited Waller and Milton , wrote a brief life of the latter poet ,— with which most of our readers are acquainted ,— and indited some respectable verse .</p>

     <p>ROBERT CRAWFORD .</p>
     <p>Robert Crawford , a Scotchman , is our next poet . Of him we know only that he was the brother of Colonel Crawford of Achinames ; that he assisted Allan Ramsay in the ‘ Tea-Table Miscellany ; ’ and was drowned when coming from France in 1733 . Besides the popular song , ‘ The Bush aboon Traquair , ’ which we quote , Crawford wrote also a lyric , called ‘ Tweedside , ’ and some verses , mentioned by Burns , to the old tune of ‘ Cowdenknowes . ’</p>

     <p>THOMAS TICKELL .</p>
     <p>Tickell is now chiefly remembered from his connexion with Addison . He was born in 1686 , at Bridekirk , near Carlisle . In April 1701 , he became a member of Queen 's College in Oxford . In 1708 , he was made M. A ., and two years after was chosen Fellow . He held his Fellowship till 1726 , when , marrying in Dublin , he necessarily vacated it . He attracted Addison 's attention first by some elegant lines in praise of Rosamond , and then by the ‘ Prospect of Peace , ’ a poem in which Tickell , although called by Swift Whiggissimus , for once took the Tory side . This poem Addison , in spite of its politics , praised highly in the Spectator , which led to a lifelong friendship between them . Tickell commenced contributing to the Spectator , among other things publishing there a poem entitled the ‘ Royal Progress . ’ Some time after , he produced a translation of the first book of the Iliad , which Addison declared to be superior to Pope 's . This led the latter to imagine that it was Addison 's own , although it is now , we believe , certain , from the MS ., which still exists , that it was a veritable production of Tickell 's . When Addison went to Ireland , as secretary to Lord Sunderland , Tickell accompanied him , and was employed in public business . When Addison became Secretary of State , he made Tickell Under-Secretary ; and when he died , he left him the charge of publishing his works , with an earnest recommendation to the care of Craggs . Tickell faithfully performed the task , prefixing to them an elegy on his departed friend , which is now his own chief title to fame . In 1725 , he was made secretary to the Lords-Justices of Ireland , a place of great trust and honour , and which he retained till his death . This event happened at Bath , in the year 1740 .</p>
     <p>His genius was not strong , but elegant and refined , and appears , as we have just stated , to best advantage in his lines on Addison 's death , which are warm with genuine love , tremulous with sincere sorrow , and shine with a sober splendour , such as Addison 's own exquisite taste would have approved .</p>

     <p>JAMES HAMMOND .</p>
     <p>This elegiast was the second son of Anthony Hammond , a brother-in-law of Sir Robert Walpole , and a man of some note in his day . He was born in 1710 ; educated at Westminster school ; became equerry to the Prince of Wales ; fell in love with a lady named Dashwood , who rejected him , and drove him to temporary derangement , and then to elegy-writing ; entered parliament for Truro , in Cornwall , in 1741 ; and died the next year . His elegies were published after his death , and , although abounding in pedantic allusions and frigid conceits , became very popular .</p>

     <p>RICHARD SAVAGE .</p>
     <p>The extreme excellence , fulness , and popularity of Johnson 's Life of Savage must excuse our doing more than mentioning the leading dates of his history . He was the son of the Earl of Rivers and the Countess of Macclesfield , and was born in London , 1698 . His mother , who had begot him in adultery after having openly avowed her criminality , in order to obtain a divorce from her husband , placed the boy under the care of a poor woman , who brought him up as her son . His maternal grandmother , Lady Mason , however , took an interest him and placed him at a grammar school at St Alban 's . He was afterwards apprenticed to a shoemaker . On the death of his nurse , he found some letters which led to the discovery of his real parent . He applied to her , accordingly , to be acknowledged as her son ; but she repulsed his every advance , and persecuted him with unrelenting barbarity . He found , however , some influential friends , such as Steele , Fielding , Aaron Hill , Pope , and Lord Tyrconnell . He was , however , his own worst enemy , and contracted habits of the most irregular description . In a tavern brawl he killed one James Sinclair , and was condemned to die ; but , notwithstanding his mother 's interference to prevent the exercise of the royal clemency , he was pardoned by the queen , who afterwards gave him a pension of £ 50 a-year . He supported himself in a precarious way by writing poetical pieces . Lord Tyrconnell took him for a while into his house , and allowed him £ 200 a-year , but he soon quarrelled with him , and left . When the queen died he lost his pension , but his friends made it up by an annuity to the same amount . He went away to reside at Swansea , but on occasion of a visit he made to Bristol he was arrested for a small debt , and in the prison he sickened , and died on the 1st of August 1743 . He was only forty-five years of age .</p>
     <p>After all , Savage , in Johnson 's Life , is just a dung-fly preserved in amber . His ‘ Bastard , ’ indeed , displays considerable powers , stung by a consciousness of wrong into convulsive action ; but his other works are nearly worthless , and his life was that of a proud , passionate , selfish , and infatuated fool , unredeemed by scarcely one trait of genuine excellence in character . We love and admire , even while we deeply blame , such men as Burns ; but for Savage our feeling is a curious compost of sympathy with his misfortunes , contempt for his folly , and abhorrence for the ingratitude , licentiousness , and other coarse and savage sins which characterised and prematurely destroyed him .</p>

     <p>JONATHAN SWIFT .</p>
     <p>In contemplating the lives and works of the preceding poets in this third volume of ‘ Specimens , ’ we have been impressed with a sense , if not of their absolute , yet of their comparative mediocrity . Beside such neglected giants as Henry More , Joseph Beaumont , and Andrew Marvell , the Pomfrets , Sedleys , Blackmores , and Savages sink into insignificance . But when we come to the name of Swift , we feel ourselves again approaching an Alpine region . The air of a stern mountain-summit breathes chill around our temples , and we feel that if we have no amiability to melt , we have altitude at least to measure , and strange profound secrets of nature , like the ravines of lofty hills , to explore . The men of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries may be compared to Lebanon , or Snowdown , or Benlomond towering grandly over fertile valleys , on which they smile — Swift to the tremendous Romsdale Horn in Norway , shedding abroad , from a brow of four thousand feet high , what seems a scowl of settled indignation , as if resolved not to rejoice even over the wide - stretching deserts which , and nothing but which , it everlastingly beholds . Mountains all of them , but what a difference between such a mountain as Shakspeare , and such a mountain as Swift !</p>
     <p>Instead of going minutely over a path so long since trodden to mire as the life of Swift , let us expend a page or two in seeking to form some estimate of his character and genius . It is refreshing to come upon a new thing in the world , even though it be a strange or even a bad thing ; and certainly , in any age and country , such a being as Swift must have appeared an anomaly , not for his transcendent goodness , not for his utter badness , but because the elements of good and evil were mixed in him into a medley so astounding , and in proportions respectively so large , yet unequal , that the analysis of the two seemed to many competent only to the Great Chymist , Death , and that a sense of the disproportion seems to have moved the man himself to inextinguishable laughter ,— a laughter which , radiating out of his own singular heart as a centre , swept over the circumference of all beings within his reach , and returned crying , ‘ Give , give , ’ as if he were demanding a universal sphere for the exercise of the savage scorn which dwelt within him , and as if he laughed not more ‘ consumedly ’ at others than he did at himself .</p>
     <p>Ere speaking of Swift as a man , let us say something about his genius . That , like his character , was intensely peculiar . It was a compound of infinite ingenuity , with very little poetical imagination — of gigantic strength , with a propensity to incessant trifling — of passionate purpose , with the clearest and coldest expression , as though a furnace were fuelled with snow . A Brobdignagian by size , he was for ever toying with Lilliputian slings and small craft . One of the most violent of party men , and often fierce as a demoniac in temper , his favourite motto was Vive la bagatelle . The creator of entire new worlds , we doubt if his works contain more than two or three lines of genuine poetry . He may be compared to one of the locusts of the Apocalypse , in that he had a tail like unto a scorpion , and a sting in his tail ; but his ‘ face is not as the face of man , his hair is not as the hair of women , and on his head there is no crown like gold . ’ All Swift 's creations are more or less disgusting . Not one of them is beautiful . His Lilliputians are amazingly life-like , but compare them to Shakspeare 's fairies , such as Peaseblossom , Cobweb , and Mustardseed ; his Brobdignagians are excrescences like enormous warts ; and his Yahoos might have been spawned in the nightmare of a drunken butcher . The same coarseness characterises his poems and his ‘ Tale of a Tub . ’ He might well , however , in his old age , exclaim , in reference to the latter , ‘ Good God ! what a genius I had when I wrote that book ! ’ It is the wildest , wittiest , wickedest , wealthiest book of its size in the English language . Thoughts and figures swarm in every corner of its pages , till you think of a disturbed nest of angry ants , for all the figures and thoughts are black and bitter . One would imagine the book to have issued from a mind that had been gathering gall as well as sense in an antenatal state of being .</p>
     <p>Swift , in all his writings — sermons , political tracts , poems , and fictions — is essentially a satirist . He consisted originally of three principal parts ,— sense , an intense feeling of the ludicrous , and selfish passion ; and these were sure , in certain circumstances , to ferment into a spirit of satire , ‘ strong as death , and cruel as the grave . ’ Born with not very much natural benevolence , with little purely poetic feeling , with furious passions and unbounded ambition , he was entirely dependent for his peace of mind upon success . Had he become , as by his talents he was entitled to be , the prime minister of his day , he would have figured as a greater tyrant in the cabinet than even Chatham . But as he was prevented from being the first statesman , he became the first satirist of his time . From vain efforts to grasp supremacy for himself and his party , he retired growling to his Dublin den ; and there , as Haman thought scorn to lay his hand on Mordecai , but extended his murderous purpose to all the people of the Jews ,— and as Nero wished that Rome had one neck , that he might destroy it at a blow ,— so Swift was stung by his personal disappointment to hurl out scorn at man and suspicion at his Maker . It was not , it must be noticed , the evil which was in man which excited his hatred and contempt ; it was man himself . He was not merely , as many are , disgusted with the selfish and malignant elements which are mingled in man 's nature and character , and disposed to trace them to any cause save a Divine will , but he believed man to be , as a whole , the work and child of the devil ; and he told the imaginary creator and creature to their face , what he thought the truth ,— ‘ The devil is an ass . ’ His was the very madness of Manichaeism . That heresy held that the devil was one of two aboriginal creative powers , but Swift seemed to believe at times that he was the only God . From a Yahoo man , it was difficult to avoid the inference of a demon deity . It is very laughable to find writers in Blackwood and elsewhere striving to prove Swift a Christian , as if , whatever were his professions , and however sincere he might be often in these , the whole tendency of his writings , his perpetual and unlimited abuse of man 's body and soul , his denial of every human virtue , the filth he pours upon every phase of human nature , and the doctrine he insinuates — that man has fallen indeed , but fallen , not from the angel , but from the animal , or , rather , is just a bungled brute ,— were not enough to shew that either his notions were grossly erroneous and perverted , or that he himself deserved , like another Nebuchadnezzar , to be driven from men , and to have a beast 's heart given unto him . Sometimes he reminds us of an impure angel , who has surprised man naked and asleep , looked at him with microscopic eyes , ignored all his peculiar marks of fallen dignity and incipient godhood , and in heartless rhymes reported accordingly .</p>
     <p>Swift belonged to the same school as Pope , although the feminine element which was in the latter modified and mellowed his feelings . Pope was a more successful and a happier man than Swift . He was much smaller , too , in soul as well as in body , and his gall-organ was proportionably less . Pope 's feeling to humanity was a tiny malice ; Swift 's became , at length , a black malignity . Pope always reminds us of an injured and pouting hero of Lilliput , ‘ doing well to be angry ’ under the gourd of a pocket-flap , or squealing out his griefs from the centre of an empty snuff-box ; Swift is a man , nay , monster of misanthropy . In minute and microscopic vision of human infirmities , Pope excels even Swift ; but then you always conceive Swift leaning down a giant , though gnarled , stature to behold them , while Pope is on their level , and has only to look straight before him . Pope 's wrath is always measured ; Swift 's , as in the ‘ Legion-Club ’ is a whirlwind of ‘ black fire and horror , ’ in the breath of which no flesh can live , and against which genius and virtue themselves furnish no shield .</p>
     <p>After all , Swift might , perhaps , have put in the plea of Byron —</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">‘ All my faults perchance thou knowest ,</l>
       <l n="2">All my madness none can know . ’</l>
     </lg>
     <p>There was a black spot of madness in his brain , and another black spot in his heart ; and the two at last met , and closed up his destiny in night . Let human nature forgive its most determined and systematic reviler , for the sake of the wretchedness in which he was involved all his life long . He was born ( in 1667 ) a posthumous child ; he was brought up an object of charity ; he spent much of his youth in dependence ; he had to leave his Irish college without a degree ; he was flattered with hopes from King William and the Whigs , which were not fulfilled ; he was condemned to spend a great part of his life in Ireland , a country he detested ; he was involved — partly , no doubt , through his own blame — in a succession of fruitless and miserable intrigues , alike of love and politics ; he was soured by want of success in England , and spoiled by enormous popularity in Ireland ; he was tried by a kind of religious doubts , which would not go out to prayer or fasting ; he was haunted by the fear of the dreadful calamity which at last befell him ; his senses and his soul left him one by one ; he became first giddy , then deaf , and then mad ; his madness was of the most terrible sort — it was a ‘ silent rage ; ’ for a year or two he lay dumb ; and at last , on the 19th of October 1745 ,</p>
     <p>‘ Swift expired , a driveller and a show , ’</p>
     <p>leaving his money to found a lunatic asylum , and his works as a many - volumed legacy of curse to mankind .</p>
     <note>Note : It has been asserted that there were circumstances in extenuation of Swift 's conduct , particularly in reference to the ladies whose names were connected with his , which cannot be publicly brought forward .</note>

     <p>ISAAC WATTS .</p>
     <p>We feel relieved , and so doubtless do our readers , in passing from the dark tragic story of Swift , and his dubious and unhappy character , to contemplate the useful career of a much smaller , but a much better man , Isaac Watts . This admirable person was born at Southampton on the 17th of July 1674 . His father , of the same name , kept a boarding-school for young gentlemen , and was a man of intelligence and piety . Isaac was the eldest of nine children , and began early to display precocity of genius . At four he commenced to study Latin at home , and afterwards , under one Pinhorn , a clergyman , who kept the free-school at Southampton , he learned Latin , Hebrew , and Greek . A subscription was proposed for sending him to one of the great universities , but he preferred casting in his lot with the Dissenters . He repaired accordingly , in 1690 , to an academy kept by the Rev . Thomas Rowe , whose son , we believe , became the husband of the celebrated Elizabeth Rowe , the once popular author of ‘ Letters from the Dead to the Living . ’ The Rowes belonged to the Independent body . At this academy Watts began to write poetry , chiefly in the Latin language , and in the then popular Pindaric measure . At the age of twenty , he returned to his father 's house , and spent two quiet years in devotion , meditation , and study . He became next a tutor in the family of Sir John Hartopp for five years . He was afterwards chosen assistant to Dr Chauncey , and , after the Doctor 's death , became his successor . His health , however , failed , and , after getting an assistant for a while , he was compelled to resign . In 1712 , Sir Thomas Abney , a benevolent gentleman of the neighbourhood , received Watts into his house , where he continued during the rest of his life — all his wants attended to , and his feeble frame so tenderly cared for that he lived to the age of seventy-five . Sir Thomas died eight years after Dr Watts entered his establishment , but the widow and daughters continued unwearied in their attentions . Abney House was a mansion surrounded by fine gardens and pleasure-grounds , where the Doctor became thoroughly at home , and was wont to refresh his body and mind in the intervals of study . He preached regularly to a congregation , and in the pulpit , although his stature was low , not exceeding five feet , the excellence of his matter , the easy flow of his language , and the propriety of his pronunciation , rendered him very popular . In private he was exceedingly kind to the poor and to children , giving to the former a third part of his small income of £ 100 a-year , and writing for the other his inimitable hymns . Besides these , he published a well-known treatise on Logic , another on ‘ The Improvement of the Mind , ’ besides various theological productions , amongst which his ‘ World to Come ’ has been preeminently popular . In 1728 , he received from Edinburgh and Aberdeen an unsolicited diploma of Doctor of Divinity . As age advanced , he found himself unable to discharge his ministerial duties , and offered to remit his salary , but his congregation refused to accept his demission . On the 25th November 1748 , quite worn out , but without suffering , this able and worthy man expired .</p>
     <p>If to be eminently useful is to fulfil the highest purpose of humanity , it was certainly fulfilled by Isaac Watts . His logical and other treatises have served to brace the intellects , methodise the studies , and concentrate the activities of thousands — we had nearly said of millions of minds . This has given him an enviable distinction , but he shone still more in that other province he so felicitously chose and so successfully occupied — that of the hearts of the young . One of his detractors called him ‘ Mother Watts . ’ He might have taken up this epithet , and bound it as a crown unto him . We have heard of a pious foreigner , possessed of imperfect English , who , in an agony of supplication to God for some sick friend , said , ‘ O Fader , hear me ! O Mudder , hear me ! ’ It struck us as one of the finest of stories , and containing one of the most beautiful tributes to the Deity we ever heard , recognising in Him a pity which not even a father , which only a mother can feel . Like a tender mother does good Watts bend over the little children , and secure that their first words of song shall be those of simple , heartfelt trust in God , and of faith in their Elder Brother . To create a little heaven in the nursery by hymns , and these not mawkish or twaddling , but beautifully natural and exquisitely simple breathings of piety and praise , was the high task to which Watts consecrated , and by which he has immortalised , his genius .</p>

     <p>AMBROSE PHILIPS .</p>
     <p>This gentleman — remembered now chiefly as Pope 's temporary rival — was born in 1671 , in Leicestershire ; studied at Cambridge ; and , being a great Whig , was appointed by the government of George I. to be Commissioner of the Collieries , and afterwards to some lucrative appointments in Ireland . He was also made one of the Commissioners of the Lottery . He was elected member for Armagh in the Irish House of Commons . He returned home in 1748 , and died the next year in his lodgings at Vauxhall .</p>
     <p>His works are ‘ The Distressed Mother , ’ a tragedy translated from Racine , and greatly praised in the Spectator ; two deservedly forgotten plays , ‘ The Briton , ’ and ‘ Humphrey , Duke of Gloucester ; ’ some miscellaneous pieces , of which an epistle to the Earl of Dorset , dated Copenhagen , has some very vivid lines ; his Pastorals , which were commended by Tickell at the expense of those of Pope , who took his revenge by damning them , not with ‘ faint ’ but with fulsome and ironical praise , in the Guardian ; and the subjoined fragment from Sappho , which is , particularly in the first stanza , melody itself . Some conjecture that it was touched up by Addison .</p>

     <p>WILLIAM HAMILTON .</p>
     <p>William Hamilton , of Bangour , was born in Ayrshire in 1704 . He was of an ancient family , and mingled from the first in the most fashionable circles . Ere he was twenty he wrote verses in Ramsay 's ‘ Tea-Table Miscellany . ’ In 1745 , to the surprise of many , he joined the standard of Prince Charles , and wrote a poem on the battle of Gladsmuir , or Prestonpans . When the reverse of his party came , after many wanderings and hair'shYpppHeNbreadth escapes in the Highlands , he found refuge in France . As he was a general favourite , and as much allowance was made for his poetical temperament , a pardon was soon procured for him by his friends , and he returned to his native country . His health , however , originally delicate , had suffered by his Highland privations , and he was compelled to seek the milder clime of Lyons , where he died in 1754 .</p>
     <p>Hamilton was what is called a ladies ’ - man , but his attachments were not deep , and he rather flirted than loved . A Scotch lady , who was annoyed at his addresses , asked John Home how she could get rid of them . He , knowing Hamilton well , advised her to appear to favour him . She acted on the advice , and he immediately withdrew his suit . And yet his best poem is a tale of love , and a tale , too , told with great simplicity and pathos . We refer to his ‘ Braes of Yarrow , ’ the beauty of which we never felt fully till we saw some time ago that lovely region , with its ‘ dowie dens , ’ — its clear living stream ,— Newark Castle , with its woods and memories ,— and the green wildernesses of silent hills which stretch on all sides around ; saw it , too , in that aspect of which Wordsworth sung in the words —</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">‘ The grace of forest charms decayed</l>
       <l n="2">And pastoral melancholy . ’</l>
     </lg>
     <p>It is the highest praise we can bestow upon Hamilton 's ballad that it ranks in merit near Wordsworth 's fine trinity of poems , ‘ Yarrow Unvisited , ’ ‘ Yarrow Visited , ’ and ‘ Yarrow Revisited . ’</p>

     <p>ALLAN RAMSAY .</p>
     <p>Crawford Muir , in Lanarkshire , was the birthplace of this true poet . His father was manager of the Earl of Hopetoun 's lead-mines . Allan was born in 1686 . His mother was Alice Bower , the daughter of an Englishman who had emigrated from Derbyshire . His father died while his son was yet in infancy ; his mother married again in the same district ; and young Allan was educated at the parish school of Leadhills . At the age of fifteen , he was sent to Edinburgh , and bound apprentice to a wig-maker there . This trade , however , he left after finishing his term . He displayed rather early a passion for literature , and made a little reputation by some pieces of verse ,— such as ‘ An Address to the Easy Club , ’ a convivial society with which he was connected ,— and a considerable time after by a capital continuation of King James ’ ‘ Christis Kirk on the Green . ’ In 1712 , he married a writer 's daughter , Christiana Ross , who was his affectionate companion for thirty years . Soon after , he set up a bookseller 's shop opposite Niddry 's Wynd , and in this capacity edited and published two collections ,— the one of songs , some of them his own , entitled ‘ The Tea-Table Miscellany , ’ and the other of early Scottish poems , entitled ‘ The Evergreen . ’ In 1725 , he published ‘ The Gentle Shepherd . ’ It was the expansion of one or two pastoral scenes which he ad shewn to his delighted friends . The poem became instantly popular , and was republished in London and Dublin , and widely circulated in the colonies . Pope admired it . Gay , then in Scotland with his patrons the Queensberry family , used to lounge into Ramsay 's shop to get explanations of its Scotch phrases to transmit to Twickenham , and to watch from the window the notable characters whom Allan pointed out to him in the Edinburgh Exchange . He now removed to a better shop , and set up for his sign the heads of Ben Jonson and Drummond , who agreed better in figure than they had done in reality at Hawthornden . He established the first circulating library in Scotland . His shop became a centre of intelligence , and Ramsay sat a Triton among the minnows of that rather mediocre day — giving his little senate laws , and inditing verses , songs , and fables . At forty-five — an age when Sir Walter Scott had scarcely commenced his Waverley novels , and Dryden had by far his greatest works to produce — honest Allan imagined his vein exhausted , and ceased to write , although he lived and enjoyed life for nearly thirty years more . At last , after having lost money and gained obloquy , in a vain attempt to found the first theatre in Edinburgh , and after building for himself a curious octagon-shaped house on the north side of the Castle Hill , which , while he called it Ramsay Lodge , his enemies nicknamed ‘ The Goose-pie , ’ and which , though altered , still , we believe , stands , under the name of Ramsay Garden , the author of ‘ The Gentle Shepherd ’ breathed his last on the 7th of January 1758 . He died of a scurvy in the gums . His son became a distinguished painter , intimate with Johnson , Burke , and the rest of that splendid set , although now chiefly remembered from his connexion with them and with his father .</p>
     <p>Allan Ramsay was a poet with very few of the usual poetical faults . He had an eye for nature , but he had also an eye for the main chance . He ‘ kept his shop , and his shop kept him . ’ He might sing of intrigues , and revels , and houses of indifferent reputation ; but he was himself a quiet , canny , domestic man , seen regularly at kirk and market . He had a great reverence for the gentry , with whom he fancied himself , and perhaps was , through the Dalhousie family , connected . He had a vast opinion of himself ; and between pride of blood , pride of genius , and plenty of means , he was tolerably happy . How different from poor maudlin Fergusson , or from that dark-browed , dark-eyed , impetuous being who was , within a year of Ramsay 's death , to appear upon the banks of Doon , coming into the world to sing divinely , to act insanely , and prematurely to die !</p>
     <p>A bard , in the highest use of the word , in which it approaches the meaning of prophet , Ramsay was not , else he would not have ceased so soon to sing . Whatever lyrical impulse was in him speedily wore itself out , and left him to his milder mission as a broad reflector of Scottish life — in its humbler , gentler , and better aspects . His ‘ Gentle Shepherd ’ is a chapter of Scottish still-life ; and , since the pastoral is essentially the poetry of peace , the ‘ Gentle Shepherd ’ is the finest pastoral in the world . No thunders roll among these solitary crags ; no lightnings affright these lasses among their claes at Habbie 's Howe ; the air is still and soft ; the plaintive bleating of the sheep upon the hills , the echoes of the city are distant and faintly heard , so that the very sounds seem in unison and in league with silence . One thinks of Shelley 's isle ‘ mid the Aegean deep :—</p>
     <lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">‘ It is an isle under Ionian skies ,</l>
       <l n="2">Beautiful as the wreck of Paradise ;</l>
       <l n="3">And for the harbours are not safe and good ,</l>
       <l n="4">The land would have remained a solitude ,</l>
       <l n="5">But for some pastoral people , native there ,</l>
       <l n="6">Who from the Elysian clear and sunny air</l>
       <l n="7">Draw the last spirit of the age of gold ,</l>
       <l n="8">Simple and generous , innocent and bold .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="9">The winged storms , chanting their thunder psalm</l>
       <l n="10">To other lands , leave azure chasms of calm</l>
       <l n="11">Over this isle , or weep themselves in dew ,</l>
       <l n="12">From whence the fields and woods ever renew</l>
       <l n="13">Their green and golden immortality . ’</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>Yet in the little circle of calm carved out by the magician of ‘ The Gentle Shepherd ’ there is no insipidity . Lust is sternly excluded , but love of the purest and warmest kind there breathes . The parade of learning is not there ; but strong common sense thinks , and robust and manly eloquence declaims . Humour too is there , and many have laughed at Mause and Baldy , whom all the frigid wit of ‘ Love for Love ’ and the ‘ School for Scandal ’ could only move to contempt or pity . A dénouement of great skill is not wanting to stir the calm surface of the story by the wind of surprise ; the curtain falls over a group of innocent , guileless , and happy hearts , and as we gaze at them we breathe the prayer , that Scotland 's peerage and Scotland 's peasantry may always thus be blended into one bond of mutual esteem , endearment , and excellence . Well might Campbell say — ‘ Like the poetry of Tasso and Ariosto , that of the “ Gentle Shepherd ” is engraven on the memory of its native country . Its verses have passed into proverbs , and it continues to be the delight and solace of the peasantry whom it describes . ’</p>
     <p>Ramsay has very slightly touched on the religion of his countrymen . This is to be regretted ; but if he had no sympathy with that , he , at least , disdained to counterfeit it , and its poetical aspects have since been adequately sung by other minstrels .</p>

     <p>ISAAC HAWKINS BROWNE .</p>
     <p>This writer was born at Burton-on-Trent , in 1705 . He was educated at Westminster and Cambridge , and studied law at Lincoln 's Inn . He was a man of fortune , and sat in two parliaments for Wenlock , in Shropshire . He died in 1760 . His imitations of authors are clever and amusing , and seem to have got their hint from ‘ The Splendid Shilling , ’ and to have given it to the ‘ Rejected Addresses . ’</p>

     <p>Oldys was born in 1696 , and died in 1761 . He was a very diligent collector of antiquarian materials , and the author of a Life of Raleigh . He was intimate with Captain Grose , Burns ’ friend , who used to rally him on his inordinate thirst for ale , although , if we believe Burns , it was paralleled by Grose 's liking for port .

     <p>ROBERT LLOYD .</p>
     <p>Robert Lloyd was born in London in 1733 . He was the son of one of the under-masters of Westminster School . He went to Cambridge , where he became distinguished for his talents and notorious for his dissipation . He became an usher under his father , but soon tired of the drudgery , and commenced professional author . He published a poem called ‘ The Actor , ’ which attracted attention , and was the precursor of ‘ The Rosciad . ’ He wrote for periodicals , produced some theatrical pieces of no great merit , and edited the St James ’ Magazine . This failed , and Lloyd , involved in pecuniary distresses , was cast into the Fleet . Here he was deserted by all his boon companions except Churchill , to whose sister he was attached , and who allowed him a guinea a-week and a servant , besides promoting a subscription for his benefit . When the news of Churchill 's death arrived , Lloyd was seated at dinner ; he became instantly sick , cried out ‘ Poor Charles ! I shall follow him soon , ’ and died in a few weeks . Churchill 's sister , a woman of excellent abilities , waited on Lloyd during his illness , and died soon after him of a broken heart . This was in 1764 .</p>
     <p>Lloyd was a minor Churchill . He had not his brawny force , but he had more than his liveliness of wit , and was a much better-conditioned man , and more temperate in his satire . Cowper knew , loved , admired , and in some of his verses imitated , Robert Lloyd .</p>

     <p>DAVID MALLETT .</p>
     <p>David Mallett was the son of a small innkeeper in Crieff , Perthshire , where he was born in the year 1700 . Crieff , as many of our readers know , is situated on the western side of a hill , and commands a most varied and beautiful prospect , including Drummond Castle , with its solemn shadowy woods , and the Ochils , on the south ,— Ochtertyre , one of the loveliest spots in Scotland , and the gorge of Glenturrett , on the north ,— and the bold dark hills which surround the romantic village of Comrie , on the west . Crieff is now a place of considerable note , and forms a centre of summer attraction to multitudes ; but at the commencement of the eighteenth century it must have been a miserable hamlet . Malloch was originally the name of the poet , and the name is still common in that part of Perthshire . David attended the college of Aberdeen , and became , afterwards , an unsalaried tutor in the family of Mr Home of Dreghorn , near Edinburgh . We find him next in the Duke of Montrose 's family , with a salary of £ 30 per annum . In 1723 , he accompanied his pupils to London , and changed his name to Mallett , as more euphonious . Next year , he produced his pretty ballad of ‘ William and Margaret , ’ and published it in Aaron Hill 's ‘ Plain Dealer . ’ This served as an introduction to the literary society of the metropolis , including such names as Young and Pope . In 1733 , he disgraced himself by a satire on the greatest man then living , the venerable Richard Bentley . Mallett was one of those mean creatures who always worship a rising , and turn their backs on a setting sun . By his very considerable talents , his management , and his address , he soon rose in the world . He was appointed under-secretary to the Prince of Wales , with a salary of £ 200 a-year . In conjunction with Thomson , to whom he was really kind , he wrote in 1740 , ‘ The Masque of Alfred , ’ in honour of the birthday of the Princess Augusta . His first wife , of whom nothing is recorded , having died , he married the daughter of Lord Carlisle 's steward , who brought him a fortune of £ 10 , 000 . Both she and Mallett himself gave themselves out as Deists . This was partly owing to his intimacy with Bolingbroke , to gratify whom , he heaped abuse upon Pope in a preface to ‘ The Patriot-King , ’ and was rewarded by Bolingbroke leaving him the whole of his works and MSS . These he afterwards published , and exposed himself to the vengeful sarcasm of Johnson , who said that Bolingbroke was a scoundrel and a coward ;— a scoundrel , to charge a blunderbuss against Christianity ; and a coward , because he durst not fire it himself , but left a shilling to a beggarly Scotsman to draw the trigger after his death . Mallett ranked himself among the calumniators and , as it proved , murderers of Admiral Byng . He wrote a Life of Lord Bacon , in which , it was said , he forgot that Bacon was a philosopher , and would probably , when he came to write the Life of Marlborough , forget that he was a general . This Life of Bacon is now utterly forgotten . We happened to read it in our early days , and thought it a very contemptible performance . The Duchess of Marlborough left £ 1000 in her will between Glover and Mallett to write a Life of her husband . Glover threw up his share of the work , and Mallett engaged to perform the whole , to which , besides , he was stimulated by a pension from the second Duke of Marlborough . He got the money , but when he died it was found that he had not written a line of the work . In his latter days he held the lucrative office of Keeper of the Book of Entries for the port of London . He died on the 2lst April 1765 .</p>
     <p>Mallett is , on the whole , no credit to Scotland . He was a bad , mean , insincere , and unprincipled man , whose success was procured by despicable and dastardly arts . He had doubtless some genius , and his ‘ Birks of Invermay , ’ and ‘ William and Margaret , ’ shall preserve his name after his clumsy imitation of Thomson , called ‘ The Excursion , ’ and his long , rambling ‘ Amyntor and Theodora ; ’ have been forgotten .</p>

      <head>DR JAMES GRAINGER .</head>
      <head>This writer possessed some true imagination , although his claim to immortality lies in the narrow compass of one poem — his ‘ Ode to Solitude . ’ Little is known of his personal history . He was born in 1721 — belonging to a gentleman 's family in Cumberland . He studied medicine , and was for some time a surgeon connected with the army . When the peace came , he established himself in London as a medical practitioner . In 1755 , he published his ‘ Solitude , ’ which found many admirers , including Dr Johnson , who pronounced its opening lines ‘ very noble . ’ He afterwards indited several other pieces , wrote a translation of Tibullus , and became one of the critical staff of the Monthly Review . He was unable , however , through all these labours to secure a competence , and , in 1759 , he sought the West Indies . In St Christopher 's he commenced practising as a physician , and married the Governor 's daughter , who brought him a fortune . He wrote a poem entitled ‘ The Sugar-cane . ’ This was sent over to London in MS ., and was read at Sir Joshua Reynold 's table to a literary coterie , who , according to Boswell , all burst out into a laugh when , after much blank-verse pomp , the poet began a new paragraph thus —</head>
       <l n="1">‘ Now , Muse , let 's sing of rats !</l>
     </lg>
     <p>And what increased the ridicule was , that one of the company , slily overlooking the reader , found that the word had been originally ‘ mice , ’ but had been changed to rats as more dignified .</p>
     <p>Boswell goes on to record Johnson 's opinion of Grainger . He said , ‘ He was an agreeable man , a man that would do any good that was in his power . ’ His translation of Tibullus was very well done , but ‘ The Sugar - cane , a Poem , ’ did not please him . ‘ What could he make of a Sugar-cane ? one might as well write “ The Parsley-bed , a Poem , ” or “ The Cabbage Garden , a Poem . " ’ Boswell — ‘ You must then pickle your cabbage with the sal Atticum . ’ Johnson — ‘ One could say a great deal about cabbage . The poem might begin with the advantages of civilised society over a rude state , exemplified by the Scotch , who had no cabbages till Oliver Cromwell 's soldiers introduced them , and one might thus shew how arts are propagated by conquest , as they were by the Roman arms . ’ Cabbage , by the way , in a metaphorical sense , might furnish a very good subject for a literary satire .</p>
     <p>Grainger died of the fever of the country in 1767 . Bishop Percy corroborates Johnson 's character of him as a man . He says , ‘ He was not only a man of genius and learning , but had many excellent virtues , being one of the most generous , friendly , benevolent men I ever knew . ’</p>
     <p>Grainger in some points reminds us of Dyer . Dyer staked his reputation on ‘ The Fleece ; ’ but it is his lesser poem , ‘ Grongar Hill , ’ which preserves his name ; that fine effusion has survived the laboured work . And so Grainger 's ‘ Solitude ’ has supplanted the stately ‘ Sugar-cane . ’ The scenery of the West Indies had to wait till its real poet appeared in the author of ‘ Paul and Virginia . ’ Grainger was hardly able to cope with the strange and gorgeous contrasts it presents of cliffs and crags , like those of Iceland , with vegetation rich as that of the fairest parts of India , and of splendid sunshine , with tempests of such tremendous fury that , but for their brief continuance , no property could be secure , and no life could be safe .</p>
     <p>The commencement of the ‘ Ode to Solitude ’ is fine , but the closing part becomes tedious . In the middle of the poem there is a tumult of personifications , some of them felicitous and others forced .</p>

     <p>MICHAEL BRUCE .</p>
     <p>We refer our readers to Dr Mackelvie 's well-known and very able Life of poor Bruce , for his full story , and for the evidence on which his claim to the ‘ Cuckoo ’ is rested . Apart from external evidence , we think that poem more characteristic of Bruce 's genius than of Logan 's , and have therefore ranked it under Bruce 's name .</p>
     <p>Bruce was born on the 27th of March 1746 , at Kinnesswood , parish of Portmoak , county of Kinross . His father was a weaver , and Michael was the fifth of a family of eight children .</p>
     <p>Poor as his parents were , they were intelligent , religious , and most conscientious in the discharge of their duties to their children . In the summer months Michael was sent out to herd cattle ; and one loves to imagine the young poet wrapt in his plaid , under a whin-bush , while the storm was blowing ,— or gazing at the rainbow from the summit of a fence ,— or admiring at Lochleven and its old ruined castle ,— or weaving around the form of some little maiden , herding in a neighbouring field — some ‘ Jeanie Morrison ’ — one of those webs of romantic early love which are beautiful and evanescent as the gossamer , but how exquisitely relished while they last ! Say not , with one of his biographers , that his ‘ education was retarded by this employment ; ’ he was receiving in these solitary fields a kind of education which no school and no college could furnish ; nay , who knows but , as he saw the cuckoo winging her way from one deep woodland recess to another , or heard her dull , divine monotone coming from the heart of the forest , the germ of that exquisite strain , ‘ least in the kingdom ’ of the heaven of poetry in size , but immortal in its smallness , was sown in his mind ? In winter he went to school , and profited there so much , that at fifteen ( not a very early period , after all , for a Scotch student beginning his curriculum — in our day twelve was not an uncommon age ) he was judged fit for going to college . And just in time a windfall came across the path of our poet , the mention of which may make many of our readers smile . This was a legacy which was left his father by a relative , amounting to 200 merks , or £ 11 , 2s. 6d . With this munificent sum in his pocket , Bruce was sent to study at Edinburgh College . Here he became distinguished by his attainments , and particularly his taste and poetic powers ; and here , too , he became acquainted with John Logan , afterwards his biographer . After spending three sessions at college , supported by his parents and other friends , he returned to the country , and taught a school at Gairney Bridge ( a place famous for the first meeting of the first presbytery of the Seceders ) for £ 11 of salary . Thence he removed to Foresthill , near Alloa , where a damp school-room , poverty , and hard labour in teaching , united to injure his health and depress his spirits . At Foresthill he wrote his poem ‘ Lochleven , ’ which discovers no small descriptive power . Consumption began now to make its appearance , and he returned to the cottage of his parents , where he wrote his ‘ Elegy on Spring , ’ in which he refers with dignified pathos to his approaching dissolution . On the 5th of July 1767 , this remarkable youth died , aged twenty-one years and three months . His Bible was found on his pillow , marked at the words , Jer . xxii . 10 , ‘ Weep ye not for the dead , neither bemoan him : but weep sore for him that goeth away : for he shall return no more , nor see his native country . ’</p>
     <p>Lord Craig wrote some time afterwards an affecting paper in the Mirror , recording the fate , and commending the genius of Bruce . John Logan , in 1770 , published his poems . In the year 1807 , the kind-hearted Principal Baird published an edition of the poems for the behoof of Bruce 's mother , then an aged widow . And in 1837 , Dr William Mackelvie , Balgedie , Kinross - shire , published what may be considered the standard Life of this poet , along with a complete edition of his Works .</p>
     <p>It is impossible from so small a segment of a circle as Bruce 's life describes , to infer with any certainty the whole . So far as we can judge from the fragments left , his power was rather in the beautiful , than in the sublime or in the strong . The lines on Spring , from the words ‘ Now spring returns ’ to the close , form a continuous stream of pensive loveliness . How sweetly he sings in the shadow of death ! Nor let us too severely blame his allusion to the old Pagan mythology , in the words —</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">‘ I hear the helpless wail , the shriek of woe ,</l>
       <l n="2">I see the muddy wave , the dreary shore ; ’</l>
     </lg>
     <p>remembering that he was still a mere student , and not recovered from that fine intoxication in which classical literature drenches a young imaginative soul , and that at last we find him ‘ resting in the hopes of an eternal day . ’ ‘ Lochleven ’ is the spent echo of the ‘ Seasons , ’ although , as we said before , its descriptions possess considerable merit . His ‘ Last Day ’ is more ambitious than successful . If we grant the ‘ Cuckoo ’ to be his , as we are inclined decidedly to do , it is a sure title to fame , being one of the sweetest little poems in any language . Shakspeare would have been proud of the verse —</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">‘ Sweet bird ! thy bower is ever green ,</l>
       <l n="2">Thy sky is ever clear ;</l>
       <l n="3">Thou hast no sorrow in thy song ,</l>
       <l n="4">No winter in thy year . ’</l>
     </lg>
     <p>Bruce has not , however , it has always appeared to us , caught so well as Wordsworth the differentia of the cuckoo ,— its invisible , shadowy , shifting , supernatural character — heard , but seldom seen — its note so limited and almost unearthly :—</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">‘ O Cuckoo , shall I call thee bird ,</l>
       <l n="2">Or but a wandering voice ? ’</l>
     </lg>
     <p>How fine this conception of a separated voice — ‘ The viewless spirit of a lonely sound , ’ plaining in the woods as if seeking for some incarnation it cannot find , and saddening the spring groves by a note so contradictory to the genius of the season . In reference to the note of the cuckoo we find the following remarks among the fragments from the commonplace-book of Dr Thomas Brown , printed by Dr Welsh :— ‘ The name of the cuckoo has generally been considered as a very pure instance of imitative harmony . But in giving that name , we have most unjustly defrauded the poor bird of a portion of its very small variety of sound . The second syllable is not a mere echo of the first ; it is the sound reversed , like the reading of a sotadic line ; and to preserve the strictness of the imitation we should give it the name of Ook-koo . ’ This is the prose of the cuckoo after its poetry .</p>

     <p>CHRISTOPHER SMART .</p>
     <p>We hear of ‘ Single-speech Hamilton . ’ We have now to say something of ‘ Single-poem Smart , ’ the author of one of the grandest bursts of devotional and poetical feeling in the English language — the ‘ Song to David . ’ This poor unfortunate was born at Shipbourne , Kent , in 1722 . His father was steward to Lord Barnard , who , after his death , continued his patronage to the son , who was then eleven years of age . The Duchess of Cleveland , through Lord Barnard 's influence , bestowed on Christopher an allowance of £ 40 a-year . With this he went to Pembroke Hall , Cam - bridge , in 1739 ; was in 1745 elected a Fellow of Pembroke , and in 1747 took his degree of M. A . At college , Smart began to display that reckless dissipation which led afterwards to such melancholy consequences . He studied hard , however , at intervals ; wrote poetry both in Latin and English ; produced a comedy called a ‘ Trip to Cambridge ; or , The Grateful Fair , ’ which was acted in the hall of Pembroke College ; and , in spite of his vices and follies , was popular on account of his agreeable manners and amiable dispositions . Having become acquainted with Newberry , the benevolent , red-nosed bookseller commemorated in ‘ The Vicar of Wakefield , ’ — for whom he wrote some trifles ,— he married his step - daughter , Miss Carnan , in the year 1753 . He now removed to London , and became an author to trade . He wrote a clever satire , entitled ‘ The Hilliad , ’ against Sir John Hill , who had attacked him in an underhand manner . He translated the fables of Phaedrus into verse ,— Horace into prose ( ‘ Smart 's Horace ’ used to be a great favourite , under the rose , with schoolboys ) ; made an indifferent version of the Psalms and Paraphrases , and a good one , at a former period , of Pope 's ‘ Ode on St Cecilia 's Day , ’ with which that poet professed himself highly pleased . He was employed on a monthly publication called The Universal Visitor . We find Johnson giving the following account of this matter in Boswell 's Life :— ‘ Old Gardner , the bookseller , employed Rolt and Smart to write a monthly miscellany called The Universal Visitor . ’ There was a formal written contract . They were bound to write nothing else ,— they were to have , I think , a third of the profits of the sixpenny pamphlet , and the contract was for ninety-nine years . I wrote for some months in The Universal Visitor for poor Smart , while he was mad , not then knowing the terms on which he was engaged to write , and thinking I was doing him good . I hoped his wits would soon return to him . Mine returned to me , and I wrote in The Universal Visitor no longer . ’</p>
     <p>Smart at last was called to pay the penalty of his blended labour and dissipation . In 1763 he was shut up in a madhouse . His derangement had exhibited itself in a religious way : he insisted upon people kneeling down along with him in the street and praying . During his confinement , writing materials were denied him , and he used to write his poetical pieces with a key on the wainscot . Thus , ‘ scrabbling , ’ like his own hero , on the wall , he produced his immortal ‘ Song to David . ’ He became by and by sane ; but , returning to his old habits , got into debt , and died in the King 's Bench prison , after a short illness , in 1770 .</p>
     <p>The ‘ Song to David ’ has been well called one of the greatest curiosities of literature . It ranks in this point with the tragedies written by Lee , and the sermons and prayers uttered by Hall in a similar melancholy state of mind . In these cases , as well as in Smart 's , the thin partition between genius and madness was broken down in thunder ,— the thunder of a higher poetry than perhaps they were capable of even conceiving in their saner moments . Lee produced in that state — which was , indeed , nearly his normal one — some glorious extravagancies . Hall 's sermons , monologised and overheard in the madhouse , are said to have transcended all that he preached in his healthier moods . And , assuredly , the other poems by Smart scarcely furnish a point of comparison with the towering and sustained loftiness of some parts of the ‘ Song to David . ’ Nor is it loftiness alone ,— although the last three stanzas are absolute inspiration , and you see the waters of Castalia tossed by a heavenly wind to the very summit of Parnassus ,— but there are innumerable exquisite beauties and subtleties , dropt as if by the hand of rich haste , in every corner of the poem . Witness his description of David 's muse , as a</p>

     <p>Incoherence and extravagance we find here and there ; but it is not the flutter of weakness , it is the fury of power : from the very stumble of the rushing steed , sparks are kindled . And , even as Baretti , when he read the Rambler , in Italy , thought within himself , If such are the lighter productions of the English mind , what must be the grander and sterner efforts of its genius ? and formed , consequently , a strong desire to visit that country ; so might he have reasoned , If such poems as ‘ David ’ issue from England 's very madhouses , what must be the writings of its saner and nobler poetic souls ? and thus might he , from the parallax of a Smart , have been able to rise toward the ideal altitudes of a Shakspeare or a Milton . Indeed , there are portions of the ‘ Song to David , ’ which a Milton or a Shakspeare has never surpassed . The blaze of the meteor often eclipses the light of</p>

     <p>THOMAS CHATTERTON .</p>
     <p>The history of this ‘ marvellous boy ’ is familiar to all the readers of English poetry , and requires only a cursory treatment here . Thomas Chatterton was born in Bristol , November 20 , 1752 . His father , a teacher in the free-school there , had died before his birth , and he was sent to be educated at a charity-school . He first learned to read from a black - letter Bible . At the age of fourteen , he was put apprentice to an attorney ; a situation which , however uncongenial , left him ample leisure for pursuing his private studies . In an unlucky hour , some evil genius seemed to have whispered to this extra-ordinary youth ,— ‘ Do not find or force , but forge thy way to renown ; the other paths to the summit of the hill are worn and common-place ; try a new and dangerous course , the rather as I forewarn thee that thy time is short . ’ When , accordingly , the new bridge at Bristol was finished in October 1768 , Chatterton sent to a newspaper a fictitious account of the opening of the old bridge , alleging in a note that he had found the principal part of the description in an ancient MS. And having thus fairly begun to work the mint of forgery , it was amazing what a number of false coins he threw off , and with what perfect ease and mastery ! Ancient poems , pretending to have been written four hundred and fifty years before ; fragments of sermons on the Holy Spirit , dated from the fifteenth century ; accounts of all the churches of Bristol as they had appeared three hundred years before ; with drawings and descriptions of the castle — most of them professing to be drawn from the writings of ‘ ane gode prieste , Thomas Rowley ’ — issued in thick succession from this wonderful , and , to use the Shakspearean word in a twofold sense , ‘ forgetive ’ brain . He next ventured to send to Horace Walpole , who was employed on a History of British Painters , an account of eminent ‘ Carvellers and Peyneters , ’ who , according to him , once flourished in Bristol . These labours he plied in secret , and with the utmost enthusiasm . He used to write by the light of the moon , deeming that there was a special inspiration in the rays of that planet , and reminding one of poor Nat Lee inditing his insane tragedies in his asylum under the same weird lustre . On Sabbaths he was wont to stroll away into the country around Bristol , which is very beautiful , and to draw sketches of those objects which impressed his imagination . He often lay down on the meadows near St Mary 's Redcliffe Church , admiring the ancient edifice ; and some years ago we saw a chamber near the summit of that edifice where he used to sit and write , his ‘ eye in a fine frenzy rolling , ’ and where we could imagine him , when a moonless night fell , composing his wild Runic lays by the light of a candle burning in a human skull . It was actually in one of the rooms of this church that some ancient chests had been deposited , including one called the ‘ Coffre of Mr Canynge , ’ an eminent merchant in Bristol , who had rebuilt the church in the reign of Edward IV . This coffer had been broken up by public authority in 1727 , and some valuable deeds had been taken out . Besides these , they contained various MSS ., some of which Chatterton 's father , whose uncle was sexton of the church , had carried off and used as covers to the copy-books of his scholars . This furnished a hint to Chatterton 's inventive genius . He gave out that among these parchments he had found many productions of Mr Canynge 's , and of the aforesaid Thomas Rowley 's , a priest of the fifteenth century , and a friend of Canynge 's . Chatterton had become a contributor to a periodical of the day called The Town and Country Magazine , and to it from time to time he sent these poems . A keen controversy arose as to their genuineness . Horace Walpole shewed some of them , which Chatterton had sent him , to Gray and Mason , who were deemed , justly , first-rate authorities on antiquarian matters , and who at once pronounced them forgeries . It is deeply to be regretted that these men , perceiving , as they must have done , the great merit of these productions , had not made more particular inquiries about them , and tried to help and save the poet . Walpole , to say the least of it , treated him coldly , telling him , when he had discovered the forgery , to attend to his own business , and keeping some of his MSS . in his hands , till an indignant letter from the author compelled him to restore them .</p>
     <p>Chatterton now determined to go to London . His three years ’ apprenticeship had expired , and there was in Bristol no further field for his aspiring genius . He found instant employment among the booksellers , and procured an introduction to Beckford , the patriot mayor , who tried to get him engaged upon the Opposition side in politics . Our capricious and unprincipled poet , however , declared that he was a poor author that could not write on both sides ; and although his leanings were to the popular party , yet on the death of Beckford he addressed a letter to Lord North in support of his administration . He had projected some large works , such as a History of England and a History of London , and wrote flaming letters to his mother and sisters about his prospects , enclosing them at the same time small remittances of money . But his bright hopes were soon overcast . Instead of a prominent political character , he found himself a mere bookseller 's hack . To this his poverty no more than his will would consent , for though that was great it was equalled by his pride . His life in the country had been regular , although his religious principles were loose ; but in town , misery drove him to intemperance , and intemperance , in its reaction , to remorse and a desperate tampering with the thought ,</p>
     <p>‘ There is one remedy for all . ’</p>
     <p>At last , after a vain attempt to obtain an appointment as a surgeon 's mate to Africa , he made up his mind to suicide . A guinea had been sent him by a gentleman , which he declined . Mrs Angel , his landlady , knowing him to be in want , the day before his death offered him his dinner , but this also he spurned ; and , on the 25th of August 1770 , having first destroyed all his papers , he swallowed arsenic , and was found dead in his bed .</p>
     <lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">He was buried in a shell in the burial-place of Shoe-Lane Workhouse .</l>
       <l n="2">He was aged seventeen years nine months and a few days . Alas for</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="3">‘ The sleepless soul that perished in his pride ! ’</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>Chatterton , had he lived , would , perhaps , have become a powerful poet , or a powerful character of some kind . But we must now view him chiefly as a prodigy . Some have treated his power as unnatural — resembling a huge hydrocephalic head , the magnitude of which implies disease , ultimate weakness , and early death . Others maintain that , apart from the extraordinary elements that undoubtedly characterised Chatterton , and constituted him a premature and prodigious birth intellectually , there was also in parts of his poems evidence of a healthy vigour which only needed favourable circumstances to develop into transcendent excellence . Hazlitt , holding with the one of these opinions , cries , ‘ If Chatterton had had a great work to do by living , he would have lived ! ’ Others retort on the critic , ‘ On the same principle , why did Keats , whom you rate so high , perish so early ? ’ The question altogether is nugatory , seeing it can never be settled . Suffice it that these songs and rhymes of Chatterton have great beauties , apart from the age and position of their author . There may at times be madness , but there is method in it . The flight of the rhapsody is ever upheld by the strength of the wing , and while the reading discovered is enormous for a boy , the depth of feeling exhibited is equally extraordinary ; and the clear , firm judgment which did not characterise his conduct , forms the root and the trunk of much of his poetry . It was said of his eyes that it seemed as if fire rolled under them ; and it rolls still , and shall ever roll , below many of his verses .</p>

     <p>KENRICK .</p>
     <p>TRANSLATED FROM THE SAXON .</p>
     <p>When winter yelled through the leafless grove ; when the black waves rode over the roaring winds , and the dark-brown clouds hid the face of the sun ; when the silver brook stood still , and snow environed the top of the lofty mountain ; when the flowers appeared not in the blasted fields , and the boughs of the leafless trees bent with the loads of ice ; when the howling of the wolf affrighted the darkly glimmering light of the western sky ; Kenrick , terrible as the tempest , young as the snake of the valley , strong as the mountain of the slain ; his armour shining like the stars in the dark night , when the moon is veiled in sable , and the blasting winds howl over the wide plain ; his shield like the black rock , prepared himself for war .</p>
     <p>Ceolwolf of the high mountain , who viewed the first rays of the morning star , swift as the flying deer , strong as the young oak , fierce as an evening wolf , drew his sword ; glittering like the blue vapours in the valley of Horso ; terrible as the red lightning , bursting from the dark-brown clouds ; his swift bark rode over the foaming waves , like the wind in the tempest ; the arches fell at his blow , and he wrapped the towers in flames : he followed Kenrick , like a wolf roaming for prey .</p>
     <p>Centwin of the vale arose , he seized the massy spear ; terrible was his voice , great was his strength ; he hurled the rocks into the sea , and broke the strong oaks of the forest . Slow in the race as the minutes of impatience . His spear , like the fury of a thunderbolt , swept down whole armies ; his enemies melted before him , like the stones of hail at the approach of the sun .</p>
     <p>Awake , O Eldulph ! thou that sleepest on the white mountain , with the fairest of women . No more pursue the dark-brown wolf : arise from the mossy bank of the falling waters ; let thy garments be stained in blood , and the streams of life discolour thy girdle ; let thy flowing hair be hid in a helmet , and thy beauteous countenance be writhed into terror .</p>
     <p>Egward , keeper of the barks , arise like the roaring waves of the sea : pursue the black companies of the enemy .</p>
     <p>Ye Saxons , who live in the air and glide over the stars , act like yourselves .</p>
     <p>Like the murmuring voice of the Severn , swelled with rain , the Saxons moved along ; like a blazing star the sword of Kenrick shone among the Britons ; Tenyan bled at his feet ; like the red lightning of heaven he burnt up the ranks of his enemy .</p>
     <p>Centwin raged like a wild boar . Tatward sported in blood ; armies melted at his stroke . Eldulph was a flaming vapour ; destruction sat upon his sword . Ceolwolf was drenched in gore , but fell like a rock before the sword of Mervin .</p>
     <p>Egward pursued the slayer of his friend ; the blood of Mervin smoked on his hand .</p>
     <p>Like the rage of a tempest was the noise of the battle ; like the roaring of the torrent , gushing from the brow of the lofty mountain .</p>
     <p>The Britons fled , like a black cloud dropping hail , flying before the howling winds .</p>
     <p>Ye virgins ! arise and welcome back the pursuers ; deck their brows with chaplets of jewels ; spread the branches of the oak beneath their feet . Kenrick is returned from the war , the clotted gore hangs terrible upon his crooked sword , like the noxious vapours on the black rock ; his knees are red with the gore of the foe .</p>
     <p>Ye sons of the song , sound the instruments of music ; ye virgins , dance around him .</p>
     <p>Costan of the lake , arise , take thy harp from the willow , sing the praise of Kenrick , to the sweet sound of the white waves sinking to the foundation of the black rock .</p>
     <p>Rejoice , O ye Saxons ! Kenrick is victorious .</p>

      <head>LORD LYTTELTON .</head>
      <head>Dr Johnson said once of Chesterfield , ‘ I thought him a lord among wits , but I find him to be only a wit among lords . ’ And so we may say of Lord Lyttelton , ‘ He is a poet among lords , if not a lord among poets . ’ He was the son of Sir Thomas Lyttelton , of Hagley in Worcestershire , and was born in 1709 . He went to Eton and Oxford , where he distinguished himself . Having gone the usual grand tour , he entered Parliament , and became an opponent of Sir Robert Walpole . He was made secretary to the Prince of Wales , and was in this capacity useful to Mallett and Thomson . In 1741 , he married Lucy Fortescue , of Devonshire , who died five years afterwards . Lyttelton grieved sincerely for her , and wrote his affecting ‘ Monody ’ on the subject . When his party triumphed , he was created a Lord of the Treasury , and afterwards Chancellor of the Exchequer , with a peerage . He employed much of his leisure in literary composition , writing a good little book on the Conversion of St Paul , a laboured History of Henry II ., and some verses , including the stanza in the ‘ Castle of Indolence ’ describing Thomson —</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">‘ A bard there dwelt , more fat than bard beseems , ’ &amp; c .—</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="2">and a very spirited prologue to Thomson 's ‘ Coriolanus , ’ which was written</l>
       <l n="3">after that author 's death , and says of him ,</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="4">— ‘ His chaste muse employed her heaven-taught lyre</l>
       <l n="5">None but the noblest passions to inspire :</l>
       <l n="6">Not one immoral , one corrupted thought ,</l>
       <l n="7">One line which , dying he could wish to blot . ’</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>Lyttelton himself died August 22 , 1773 , aged sixty-four . His History is now little read . It took him , it is said , thirty years to write it , and he employed another man to point it — a fact recalling what is told of Macaulay , that he sent the first volume of his ‘ History of England ’ to Lord Jeffrey , who overlooked the punctuation and criticised the style . Of a series of Dialogues issued by this writer , Dr Johnson remarked , with his usual pointed severity , ‘ Here is a man telling the world what the world had all his life been telling him . ’ His ‘ Monody ’ expresses real grief in an artificial style , but has some stanzas as natural in the expression as they are pathetic in the feeling .</p>

      <head>We know very little of the history of this pleasing poet . He was born in 1729 , the son of a wine-cooper in Dublin . At the age of seventeen he wrote a farce ; entitled ‘ Love in a Mist , ’ and shortly after came to Britain as an actor . He was for a long time a performer in Digges ’ company in Edinburgh , and subsequently resided in Newcastle-upon-Tyne . Here he seems to have fallen into distressed circumstances , and was supported by a benevolent printer , at whose house he died in 1773 . His poetry is distinguished by a charming simplicity .

     <p>ROBERT FERGUSSON .</p>
     <p>This unfortunate Scottish bard was born in Edinburgh on the 17th ( some say the 5th ) of October 1751 . His father , who had been an accountant to the British Linen Company 's Bank , died early , leaving a widow and four children . Robert spent six years at the grammar schools of Edinburgh and Dundee , went for a short period to Edinburgh College , and then , having obtained a bursary , to St Andrews , where he continued till his seven - teenth year . He was at first designed for the ministry of the Scottish Church . He distinguished himself at college for his mathematical knowledge , and became a favourite of Dr Wilkie , Professor of Natural Philosophy , on whose death he wrote an elegy . He early discovered a passion for poetry , and collected materials for a tragedy on the subject of Sir William Wallace , which he never finished . He once thought of studying medicine , but had neither patience nor funds for the needful preliminary studies . He went away to reside with a rich uncle , named John Forbes , in the north , near Aberdeen . This person , however , and poor Fergusson unfortunately quarrelled ; and , after residing some months in his house , he left it in disgust , and with a few shillings in his pocket proceeded southwards . He travelled on foot , and such was the effect of his vexation and fatigue , that when he reached his mother 's house he fell into a severe fit of illness .</p>
     <p>He became , on his recovery , a copying-clerk in a solicitor 's , and afterwards in a sheriff-clerk 's office , and began to contribute to Ruddiman 's Weekly Magazine . We remember in boyhood reading some odd volumes of this production , the general matter in which was inconceivably poor , relieved only by Fergusson 's racy little Scottish poems . His evenings were spent chiefly in the tavern , amidst the gay and dissipated youth of the metropolis , to whom he was the ‘ wit , songster , and mimic . ’ That his convivial powers were extraordinary , is proved by the fact of one of his contemporaries , who survived to be a correspondent of Burns , doubting if even he equalled the fascination of Fergusson 's converse . Dissipation gradually stole in upon him , in spite of resolutions dictated by remorse . In 1773 , he collected his poems into a volume , which was warmly received , but brought him , it is believed , little pecuniary benefit . At last , under the pressure of poverty , toil , and intemperance , his reason gave way , and he was by a stratagem removed to an asylum . Here , when he found himself and became aware of his situation , he uttered a dismal shriek , and cast a wild and startled look around his cell . The history of his confinement was very similar to that of Nat Lee and Christopher Smart . For instance , a story is told of him which is an exact duplicate of one recorded of Lee . He was writing by the light of the moon , when a thin cloud crossed its disk . ‘ Jupiter , snuff the moon , ’ roared the impatient poet . The cloud thickened , and entirely darkened the light . ‘ Thou stupid god , ’ he exclaimed , ‘ thou hast snuffed it out . ’ By and by he became calmer , and had some affecting interviews with his mother and sister . A removal to his mother 's house was even contemplated , but his constitution was exhausted , and on the 16th of October 1774 , poor Fergusson breathed his last . It is interesting to know that the New Testament was his favourite companion in his cell . A little after his death arrived a letter from an old friend , a Mr Burnet , who had made a fortune in the East Indies , wishing him to come out to India , and enclosing a remittance of £ 100 to defray the expenses of the journey .</p>
     <p>Thus in his twenty-fourth year perished Robert Fergusson . He was buried in the Canongate churchyard , where Burns afterwards erected a monument to his memory , with an inscription which is familiar to most of our readers .</p>
     <p>Burns in one of his poems attributes to Fergusson ‘ glorious pairts . ’ He was certainly a youth of remarkable powers , although ‘ pairts ’ rather than high genius seems to express his calibre , he can hardly be said to sing , and he never soars . His best poems , such as ‘ The Farmer 's Ingle , ’ are just lively daguerreotypes of the life he saw around him — there is nothing ideal or lofty in any of them . His ‘ ingle-bleeze ’ burns low compared to that which in ‘ The Cottar 's Saturday Night ’ springs up aloft to heaven , like the tongue of an altar-fire . He stuffs his poems , too , with Scotch to a degree which renders them too rich for even , a Scotch - man 's taste , and as repulsive as a haggis to that of an Englishman . On the whole , Fergusson 's best claim to fame arises from the influence he exerted on the far higher genius of Burns , who seems , strangely enough , to have preferred him to Allan Ramsay .</p>

     <p>EDWARD LOVIBOND .</p>
     <p>Hampton in Middlesex was the birthplace of our next poet , Edward Lovibond . He was a gentleman of fortune , who chiefly employed his time in rural occupations . He became a director of the East India Company . He helped his friend Moore in conducting the periodical called The World , to which he contributed several papers , including the very pleasing poem entitled ‘ The Tears of Old May-Day . ’ He died in 1775 .</p>

      <head>FRANCIS FAWKES .</head>
      <head>This ‘ learned and jovial parson , ’ as Campbell calls him , was born in 1721 , in Yorkshire . He studied at Cambridge , and became curate at Croydon , in Surrey . Here he obtained the friendship of Archbishop Herring , and was by him appointed vicar of Orpington in Kent , a situation which he ultimately exchanged for the rectory of Hayes , in the same county . He translated various minor Greek poets , including Anacreon , Sappho , Bion and Moschus , Theocritus , &amp; c. He died in 1777 . His ‘ Brown Jug ’ breathes some of the spirit of the first of these writers , and two or three lines of it were once quoted triumphantly in Parliament by Sheil , while charging Peel , we think it was , with appropriating arguments from Bishop Philpotts — ‘ Harry of Exeter . ’</head>

     <p>JOHN LANGHORNE .</p>
     <p>This poetical divine was born in 1735 , at Kirkby Steven , in Westmoreland . Left fatherless at four years old , his mother fulfilled her double charge of duty with great tenderness and assiduity . He was educated at Appleby , and subsequently became assistant at the free-school of Wakefield , took deacon 's orders , and gave promise , although very young , of becoming a popular preacher . After various vicissitudes of life and fortune , and publishing a number of works in prose and verse , Langhorne repaired to London , and obtained , in 1764 , the curacy and lectureship of St John 's , Clerkenwell . He soon afterwards became assistant-preacher in Lincoln 's Inn Chapel , where he had a very intellectual audience to address , and bore a somewhat trying ordeal with complete success . He continued for a number of years in London , maintaining his reputation both as a preacher and writer . His most popular works were the ‘ Letters of Theodosius and Constantia , ’ and a translation of Plutarch 's Lives , which Wrangham afterwards corrected and improved , and which is still standard . He was twice married , and survived both his wives . He obtained the living of Blagden in Somersetshire , and in addition to it , in 1777 , a prebend in the Cathedral of Wells . He died in 1779 , aged only forty-four ; his death , it is supposed , being accelerated by intemperance , although it does not seem to have been of a gross or aggravated description . Langhorne , an amiable man , and highly popular as well as warmly beloved in his day , survives now in memory chiefly through his Plutarch 's Lives , and through a few lines in his ‘ Country Justice , ’ which are immortalised by the well - known story of Scott 's interview with Burns . Campbell puts in a plea besides for his ‘ Owen of Carron , ’ but the plea , being founded on early reading , is partial , and has not been responded to by the public .</p>

     <p>SIR WILLIAM BLACKSTONE .</p>
     <p>This is not the place for writing the life of the great lawyer whose awful wig has been singed by the sarcasm of Junius . He was born in London in 1723 , and died in 1780 . He had early coquetted with poetry , but on entering the Middle Temple he bade a ‘ Farewell to his Muse ’ in the verses subjoined . So far as lucre was concerned , he chose the better part , and rose gradually on the ladder of law to be a knight and a judge in the Court of Common Pleas . It has been conjectured , from some notes on Shakspeare published by Stevens , that Sir William continued till the end of his days to hold occasional flirtations with his old flame .</p>

     <p>JOHN SCOTT .</p>
     <p>This poet is generally known as ‘ Scott of Amwell . ’ This arises from the fact that his father , a draper in Southwark , where John was born in 1730 , retired ten years afterwards to Amwell . He had never been inoculated with the small-pox , and such was his dread of the disease , and that of his family , that for twenty years , although within twenty miles of London , he never visited it . His parents , who belonged to the amiable sect of Quakers , sent him to a day-school at Ware , but that too he left upon the first alarm of infection . At seventeen , although his education was much neglected , he began to relish reading , and was materially assisted in his studies by a neighbour of the name of Frogley , a master bricklayer , who , though somewhat illiterate , admired poetry . Scott sent his first essays to the Gentleman 's Magazine , and in his thirtieth year published four elegies , which met with a kind reception , although Dr Johnson said only of them , ‘ They are very well , but such as twenty people might write . ’ He produced afterwards ‘ The Garden , ’ ‘ Amwell , ’ and other poems , besides some rather narrow ‘ Critical Essays on the English Poets . ’ When thirty-six years of age , he submitted to inoculation , and henceforward visited London frequently , and became acquainted with Dr Johnson , Sir William Jones , Mrs Montague , and other eminent characters . He was a very active promoter of local improvements , and diligent in cultivating his grounds and garden . He was twice married , his first wife being a daughter of his friend Frogley . He died in 1783 , not of that disease which he so ‘ greatly feared , ’ but of a putrid fever , at Radcliff . One note of his , entitled ‘ Ode on Hearing the Drum , ’ still reverberates on the ear of poetic readers . Wordsworth has imitated it in his ‘ Andrew Jones . ’ Sir Walter makes Rachel Geddes say , in ‘ Redgauntlet , ’ alluding to books of verse , ‘ Some of our people do indeed hold that every writer who is not with us is against us , but brother Joshua is mitigated in his opinions , and correspondeth with our friend John Scott of Amwell , who hath himself constructed verses well approved of even in the world . ’</p>

     <p>ALEXANDER ROSS .</p>
     <p>Of this fine old Scottish poet we regret that we can tell our readers so little . He was born in 1698 , became parish schoolmaster at Lochlee in Angusshire , and published , by the advice of Dr Beattie , in 1768 , a volume entitled ‘ Helenore ; or , The Fortunate Shepherdess : a Pastoral Tale in the Scottish Dialect ; along with a few Songs . ’ Some of these latter , such as ‘ Woo 'd , and Married , and a ’ ,' became very popular . Beattie loved the ‘ good-humoured , social , happy old man , ’ who was ‘ passing rich ’ on twenty pounds a-year , and wrote in the Aberdeen Journal a poetical letter in the Scotch language to promote the sale of his poem . Ross died in 1784 , about eighty-six years old , and is buried in a churchyard at the east end of the loch .</p>
     <p>Lochlee is a very solitary and romantic spot . The road to it from the low country , or Howe of the Mearns , conducts us through a winding , unequal , but very interesting glen , which , after bearing at its foot many patches of corn , yellowing amidst thick green copsewood and birch trees , fades and darkens gradually into a stern , woodless , and rocky defile , which emerges on a solitary loch , lying ‘ dern and dreary ’ amidst silent hills . It is one of those lakes which divide the distance between the loch and the tarn , being two miles in length and one in breadth . The hills , which are stony and savage , sink directly down upon its brink . A house or two are all the dwellings in view . The celebrated Thomas Guthrie dearly loves this lake , lives beside it for months at a time , and is often seen rowing his lonely boat in the midst of it , by sunlight and by moonlight too . On the west , one bold , sword-like summit , Craig Macskeldie by name , cuts the air , and relieves the monotony of the other mountains . Fit rest has Ross found in that calm , rural burying-place , beside ‘ the rude forefathers of the hamlet , ’ with short , sweet , flower - sprinkled grass covering his dust , the low voice of the lake sounding a few yards from his cold ear , and a plain gravestone uniting with his native mountains to form his memorial . ‘ Fortunate Shepherd , ’ ( shall we call him ? ) to have obtained a grave so intensely characteristic of a Scottish poet !</p>

     <p>RICHARD GLOVER .</p>
     <p>Glover was a man so remarkable as to be thought capable of having written the letters of Junius , although no one now almost names his name or reads his poetry . He was the son of a Hamburgh merchant in London , and born ( 1712 ) in St Martin 's Lane , Cannon Street . He was educated at a private school in Surrey , but being designed for trade , was never sent to a university , yet by his own exertions he became an excellent classical scholar . At sixteen he wrote a poem to the memory of Sir Isaac Newton , and at twenty-five produced nine books of his ‘ Leonidas . ’ Partly through its own merits , partly through its liberal political sentiments , and partly through the influence of Lord Cobham , to whom it was inscribed , and the praise of Fielding and Chatham , it became very popular . In 1739 , he produced a poem entitled ‘ London ; or , The Progress of Commerce , ’ and a spirited ballad entitled ‘ Admiral Hosier 's Ghost , ’ which we have given , both designed to rouse the national spirit against the Spaniards .</p>
     <p>Glover was a merchant , and very highly esteemed among his commercial brethren , although at one time unfortunate in business . When forced by his failure to seek retirement , he produced a tragedy on the subject of Boadicea , which ran the usual nine nights , although it has long since ceased to be acted or read . In his later years his affairs improved ; he returned again to public life , was elected to Parliament , and approved himself a painstaking and popular M. P . In 1770 , he enlarged his ‘ Leonidas ’ from nine books to twelve , and afterwards wrote a sequel to it , entitled ‘ The Athenais . ’ Glover spent his closing years in opulent retirement , enjoying the intimacy and respect of the most eminent men of the day , and died in 1785 .</p>
     <p>‘ Leonidas ’ may be called the epic of the eighteenth century , and betrays the artificial genius of its age . The poet rises to his flight like a heavy heron — not a hawk or eagle . Passages in it are good , but the effect of the whole is dulness . It reminds you of Cowper 's ‘ Homer , ’ in which all is accurate , but all is cold , and where even the sound of battle lulls to slumber — or of Edwin Atherstone 's ‘ Fall of Nineveh , ’ where you are fatigued with uniform pomp , and the story struggles and staggers under a load of words . Thomson exclaimed when he heard of the work of Glover , ‘ He write an epic , who never saw a mountain ! ’ And there was justice in the remark . The success of ‘ Leonidas ’ was probably one cause of the swarm of epics which appeared in the close of the eighteenth and the beginning of the nineteenth century .— Cottle himself being , according to De Quincey , ‘ the author of four epic poems , and a new kind of blacking . ’ Their day seems now for ever at an end .</p>

      <head>WILLIAM WHITEHEAD .</head>
      <head>There was also a Paul Whitehead , who wrote a satire entitled ‘ Manners , ’ which is highly praised by Boswell , and mentioned contemptuously by Campbell , and who lives in the couplet of Churchill —</head>
       <l n="1">‘ May I ( can worse disgrace on manhood fall ? )</l>
       <l n="2">Be born a Whitehead , and baptized a Paul . ’</l>
     </lg>
     <p>William Whitehead was the son of a baker in Cambridge , was born in 1715 , and studied first at Winchester , and then in Clare Hall , in his own city . He became tutor to the son of the Earl of Jersey , wrote one or two poor plays , and in 1757 , on the death of Colley Cibber , was appointed Poet-Laureate — the office having previously been refused by Gray . This roused against him a large class of those ‘ beings capable of envying even a poet-laureate , ’ to use Gray 's expression , and especially the wrath of Churchill , then the man-mountain of satiric literature , who , in his ‘ Ghost , ’ says —</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">‘ But he who in the laureate chair ,</l>
       <l n="2">By grace , not merit , planted there ,</l>
       <l n="3">In awkward pomp is seen to sit ,</l>
       <l n="4">And by his patent proves his wit , ’ &amp; c .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>To these attacks Whitehead , who was a good-natured and modest man , made no reply . In his latter years the Laureate resided in the family of Lord Jersey , and died in 1785 . His poem called ‘ Variety ’ is light and pleasant , and deserves a niche in our ‘ Specimens . ’</p>

     <p>WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE .</p>
     <p>This poet was born in Langholm , Dumfriesshire , in 1734 . His father was minister of the parish , but removed to Edinburgh , where William , after attending the High School , became clerk to a brewery , and ultimately a partner in the concern . In this he failed , however ; and in 1764 he repaired to London to prosecute literature . Lord Lyttelton became his patron , although he did him so little service in a secular point of view , that Mickle was fain to accept the situation of corrector to the Clarendon Press at Oxford . Here he published his ‘ Pollio , ’ his ‘ Concubine , ’ — a poem in the manner of Spenser , very sweetly and musically written , which became popular ,— and in 1771 the first canto of a translation of the ‘ Lusiad ’ of Camoens . This translation , which he completed in 1775 , was published by subscription , and at once increased his fortune and established his fame . He had resigned his office of corrector of the press , and was residing with Mr Tomkins , a farmer at Foresthill , near Oxford . In 1779 , he went out to Portugal as secretary to Commodore Johnstone , and , as the translator of Camoens , was received with much distinction . On his return with a little money , he married Mr Tomkins ’ daughter , who had a little more , and took up his permanent residence at Foresthill , where he died of a short illness in 1788 .</p>
     <p>His translation of the ‘ Lusiad ’ is understood to be too free and flowery , and the translator stands in the relation to Camoens which Pope does to Homer . ‘ Cumnor Hall ’ has suggested to Scott his brilliant romance of ‘ Kenilworth , ’ and is a garland worthy of being bound up in the beautiful locks of Amy Robsart for evermore . ‘ Are ye sure the news is true ? ’ is a song true to the very soul of Scottish and of general nature , and worthy , as Burns says , of ‘ the first poet . ’</p>

     <p>LORD NUGENT .</p>
     <p>Robert Craggs , afterwards created Lord Nugent , was an Irishman , a younger son of Michael Nugent , by the daughter of Robert , Lord Trimlestown , and born in 1709 . He was in 1741 elected M. P . for St Mawes , in Cornwall , and became in 1747 comptroller to the Prince of Wales ’ household . He after - wards made peace with the Court , and received various promotions and marks of favour besides the peerage . In 1739 , he published anonymously a volume of poems possessing considerable merit . He was converted from Popery , and wrote some vigorous verses on the occasion . Unfortunately , however , he relapsed , and again celebrated the event in a very weak poem , entitled ‘ Faith . ’ He died in 1788 . Although a man of decided talent , as his ‘ Ode to Mankind ’ proves , Nugent does not stand very high either in the catalogue of Irish patriots or of ‘ royal and noble authors . ’</p>

     <p>JOHN LOGAN .</p>
     <p>John Logan was born in the year 1748 . He was the son of a farmer at Soutra , in the parish of Fala , Mid-Lothian . He was educated for the church at Edinburgh , where he became intimate with Robertson , afterwards the historian . So , at least , Campbell asserts ; but he strangely calls him a student of the same standing , whereas , in fact , Robertson saw light in 1721 , and had been a settled minister five years before Logan was born . After finishing his studies , he became tutor in the family of Mr Sinclair of Ulbster , and the late well-known Sir John Sinclair was one of his pupils . When licensed to preach , Logan became popular , and was in his twenty-fifth year appointed one of the ministers of South Leith . In 1781 , he read in Edinburgh a course of lectures on the Philosophy of History , and in 1782 , he printed one of them , on the Government of Asia . In the same year he published a volume of poems , which were well received . In 1783 , he wrote a tragedy called ‘ Runnymede , ’ which was , owing to some imagined incendiary matter , prohibited from being acted on the London boards , but which was produced on the Edinburgh stage , and afterwards published . This , along with some alleged irregularities of conduct on the part of Logan , tended to alienate his flock , and he was induced to retire on a small annuity . He betook himself to London , where , in conjunction with the Rev . Mr Thomson ,— who had left the parish of Monzievaird , in Perthshire , owing to a scandal ,— he wrote for the English Review , and was employed to defend Warren Hastings . This he did in an able manner , although a well-known story describes him as listening to Sheridan , on the Oude case , with intense interest , and exclaiming , after the first hour , ‘ This is mere declamation without proof ’ — after the next two , ‘ This is a man of extraordinary powers ’ — and ere the close of the matchless oration , ‘ Of all the monsters in history , Warren Hastings is the vilest . ’ Logan died in the year 1788 , in his lodgings , Marlborough Street . His sermons were published shortly after his death , and if parts of them are , as is alleged , pilfered from a Swiss divine , ( George Joachim Zollikofer ,) they have not remained exclusively with the thief , since no sermons have been so often reproduced in Scottish pulpits as the elegant orations issued under the name of Logan .</p>
     <p>We have already declined to enter on the controversy about ‘ The Cuckoo , ’ intimating , however , our belief , founded partly upon Logan 's unscrupulous character and partly on internal evidence , that it was originally written by Bruce , but probably polished to its present perfection by Logan , whose other writings give us rather the impression of a man of varied accomplishments and excellent taste , than of deep feeling or original genius . If Logan were not the author of ‘ The Cuckoo , ’ there was a special baseness connected with the fact , that when Burke sought him out in Edinburgh , solely from his admiration of that poem , he owned the soft and false impeachment , and rolled as a sweet morsel praise from the greatest man of the age , which he knew was the rightful due of another .</p>

     <p>THOMAS BLACKLOCK .</p>
     <p>The amiable Dr Blacklock deserves praise for his character and for his conduct under very peculiar circumstances , much more than for his poetry . He was born at Annan , where his father was a bricklayer , in 1721 . When about six months old , he lost his eyesight by small-pox . His father used to read to him , especially poetry , and through the kindness of friends he acquired some knowledge of the Latin tongue . His father having been accidentally killed when Thomas was nineteen , it might have fared hard with him , but Dr Stevenson , an eminent medical man in Edinburgh , who had seen some verses composed by the blind youth , took him to the capital , sent him to college to study divinity , and encouraged him to write and to publish poetry . His volume , to which was prefixed an account of the author , by Professor Spence of Oxford , attracted much attention . Blacklock was licensed to preach in 1759 , and three years afterwards was married to a Miss Johnstone of Dumfries , an exemplary but plain-looking lady , whose beauty her husband was wont to praise so warmly that his friends were thankful that his infirmity was never removed , and thought how justly Cupid had been painted blind . He was even , through the influence of the Earl of Selkirk , appointed to the parish of Kirkcudbright , but the parishioners opposed his induction on the plea of his want of sight , and , in consideration of a small annuity , he withdrew his claims . He finally settled down in Edinburgh , where he supported himself chiefly by keeping young gentlemen as boarders in his house . His chief amusements were poetry and music . His conduct to ( 1786 ) and correspondence with Burns are too well known to require to be noticed at length here . He published a paper of no small merit in the ‘ Encyclopaedia Britannica ’ on Blindness , and is the author of a work entitled ‘ Paraclesis ; or , Consolations of Religion , ’ — which surely none require more than the blind . He died of a nervous fever on the 7th of July 1791 , so far fortunate that he did not live to see the ruin of his immortal protégé .</p>
     <p>Blacklock was a most amiable , genial , and benevolent being . He was sometimes subject to melancholy — unlike many of the blind , and one especially , whom we name not , but who , still living , bears a striking resemblance to Blacklock in fineness of mind , warmth of heart , and high - toned piety , but who is cheerful as the day . As to his poetry , it is undoubtedly wonderful , considering the circumstances of its production , if not per se . Dr Johnson says to Boswell ,— ‘ As Blacklock had the misfortune to be blind , we may be absolutely sure that the passages in his poems descriptive of visible objects are combinations of what he remembered of the works of other writers who could see . That foolish fellow Spence has laboured to explain philosophically how Blacklock may have done , by his own faculties , what it is impossible he should do . The solution , as I have given it , is plain . Suppose I know a man to be so lame that he is absolutely incapable to move himself , and I find him in a different room from that in which I left him , shall I puzzle myself with idle conjectures that perhaps his nerves have , by some unknown change , all at once become effective ? No , sir ; it is clear how he got into a different room — he was CARRIED . ’</p>
     <p>Perhaps there is a fallacy in this somewhat dogmatic statement . Perhaps the blind are not so utterly dark but they may have certain dim simulacra of external objects before their eyes and minds . Apart from this , however , Blacklock 's poetry endures only from its connexion with the author 's misfortune , and from the fact that through the gloom he groped greatly to find and give the burning hand of the peasant poet the squeeze of a kindred spirit ,— kindred , we mean , in feeling and heart , although very far removed in strength of intellect and genius .</p>

     <p>MISS ELLIOT AND MRS COCKBURN .</p>
     <p>Here we find two ladies amicably united in the composition of one of Scotland 's finest songs , the ‘ Flowers of the Forest . ’ Miss Jane Elliot of Minto , sister of Sir Gilbert Elliot of Minto , wrote the first and the finest of the two versions . Mrs Cockburn , the author of the second , was a remarkable person . Her maiden name was Alicia Rutherford , and she was the daughter of Mr Rutherford of Fernilee , in Selkirkshire . She married Mr Patrick Cockburn , a younger son of Adam Cockburn of Ormiston , Lord Justice-Clerk of Scotland . She became prominent in the literary circles of Edinburgh , and an intimate friend of David Hume , with whom she carried on a long and serious correspondence on religious subjects , in which it is understood the philosopher opened up his whole heart , but which is unfortunately lost . Mrs Cockburn , who was born in 1714 , lived to 1794 , and saw and proclaimed the wonderful promise of Walter Scott . She wrote a great deal , but the ‘ Flowers of the Forest ’ is the only one of her effusions that has been published . A ludicrous story is told of her son , who was a dissipated youth , returning one night drunk , while a large party of savans was assembled in the house , and locking himself up in the room in which their coats and hats were deposited . Nothing would rouse him ; and the company had to depart in the best substitutes they could find for their ordinary habiliments ,— Hume ( characteristically ) in a dreadnought , Monboddo in an old shabby hat , &amp; c .— the echoes of the midnight Potterrow resounding to their laughter at their own odd figures . It is believed that Mrs Cockburn 's song was really occasioned by the bankruptcy of a number of gentlemen in Selkirkshire , although she chose to throw the new matter of lamentation into the old mould of song .</p>

     <p>SUSANNA BLAMIRE .</p>
     <p>This lady was born at Cardew Hall , near Carlisle , and remained there from the date of her birth ( 1747 ) till she was twenty years of age , when she accompanied her sister — who had married Colonel Graham of Duchray , Perthshire — to Scotland , and continued there some years . She became enamoured of Scottish music and poetry , and thus qualified herself for writing such sweet lyrics as ‘ The Nabob , ’ and ‘ What ails this heart o ’ mine ? ’ On her return to Cumberland she wrote several pieces illustrative of Cumbrian manners . She died unmarried in 1794 . Her poetical pieces , some of which had been floating through the country in the form of popular songs , were collected by Mr Patrick Maxwell , and published in 1842 . The two we have quoted rank with those of Lady Nairne in nature and pathos .</p>

      <head>JAMES MACPHERSON .</head>
      <head>Now we come to one who , with all his faults , was not only a real , but a great poet . The events of his life need not detain us long . He was born at Kingussie , Inverness-shire , in 1738 , and educated at Aberdeen . At twenty he published a very juvenile production in verse , called ‘ The Highlandman : a Heroic Poem , in six cantos . ’ He taught for some time the school of Ruthven , near his native place , and became afterwards tutor in the family of Graham of Balgowan . While attending a scion of this family — afterwards Lord Lynedoch — at Moffat Wells , Macpherson became acquainted with Home , the author of ‘ Douglas , ’ and shewed to him some fragments of Gaelic poetry , translated by himself . Home was delighted with these specimens , and the consequence was , that our poet , under the patronage of Home , Blair , Adam Fergusson , and Dr Carlyle , ( the once famous ‘ Jupiter Carlyle , ’ minister of Inveresk — called ‘ Jupiter ’ because he used to sit to sculptors for their statues of ‘ Father Jove , ’ and declared by Sir Walter Scott to have been the ‘ grandest demigod he ever saw , ’ ) published , in a small volume of sixty pages , his ‘ Fragments of Ancient Poetry , translated from the Gaelic or Erse language . ’ This brochure became popular , and Macpherson was provided with a purse to go to the Highlands to collect additional pieces . The result was , in 1762 , ‘ Fingal : an Epic Poem ; ’ and , in the next year , ‘ Temora , ’ another epic poem . Their sale was prodigious , and the effect not equalled till , twenty-four years later , the poems of Burns appeared . He realised £ 1200 by these productions . In 1764 he accompanied Governor Johnston to Pensacola as his secretary , but quarrelled with him , and returned to London . Here he became a professional pamphleteer , always taking the ministerial side , and diversifying these labours by publishing a translation of Homer , in the style of his Ossian , which , as Coleridge says of another production , was ‘ damned unanimously . ’ Our readers are familiar with his row with Dr Johnson , who , when threatened with personal chastisement for his obstinate and fierce incredulity in the matter of Ossian , thus wrote the author :—</head>
       <l n="1">‘ To Mr JAMES MACPHERSON .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>‘ I received your foolish and impudent letter . Any violence offered me I shall do the best to repel , and what I cannot do for myself , the law shall do for me . I hope I shall not be deterred from detecting what I think a cheat by the menaces of a ruffian .</p>
     <p>‘ What would you have me to retract ? I thought your book an imposture . I think it an imposture still . For this opinion I have given my reasons to the public , which I dare you to refute . Your rage I defy . Your abilities , since your Homer , are not so formidable , and what I hear of your morals inclines me to pay regard , not to what you shall say , but to what you shall prove . You may print this if you will .</p>
     <p>‘ SAM . JOHNSON . ’</p>
     <p>Nothing daunted by this , and a hundred other similar rebuffs ; Macpherson , like Mallett before him , but with twenty times his abilities , pursued his peculiar course . He was appointed agent for the Nabob of Arcot , and became M. P . for Carnelford . In this way he speedily accumulated a handsome fortune , and in 1789 , while still a youngish man , he retired to his native parish , where he bought the estate of Raitts , and founded a splendid villa , called Belleville , where , in ease and affluence , he spent his remaining days . Surviving Johnson , his ablest opponent , by twelve years , he died on the 17th of February 1796 , in the full view of Ossian 's country . One of his daughters became his heir , and another was the first wife of Sir David Brewster . Macpherson in his will ordered that his body should be buried in Westminster Abbey , and left a sum of money to erect a monument to him near Belleville . He lies , accordingly , in Poets ’ Corner , and a marble obelisk to his memory may be seen near Kingussie , in the centre of some trees .</p>
     <p>There is nothing new that is true , or true that is new , to be said about the questions connected with Ossian 's Poems . That Macpherson is the sole author is a theory now as generally abandoned as the other , which held that he was simply a free translator of the old bard . To the real fragments of Ossian , which he found in the Highlands , he acted very much as he did to the ancient property of Raitts , in his own native parish . This he purchased in its crude state , and beautified into a mountain paradise . He changed , however , its name into Belleville , and it had been better if he had behaved in a similar way with the poems , and published them as , with some little groundwork from another , the veritable writings of James Macpherson , Esq . The ablest opponent of his living reputation was , as we said , Johnson ; and the ablest enemy of his posthumous fame has been Macaulay . We are at a loss to understand his animosity to the author of Ossian . Were the Macphersons and Macaulays ever at feud , and did the historian lose his great-great-grandmother in some onslaught made on the Hebrides by the progenitors of the pseudo-Ossian ? Macpherson as a man we respect not , and we are persuaded that the greater part of Ossian 's Poems can be traced no further than his teeming brain . Nor are we careful to defend his poetry from the common charges of monotony , affectation , and fustian . But we deem Macaulay grossly unjust in his treatment of Macpherson 's genius and its results , and can fortify our judgment by that of Sir Walter Scott and Professor Wilson , two men as far superior to the historian in knowledge of the Highlands and of Highland song , and in genuine poetic taste , as they were confessedly in original imagination . The former says , ‘ Macpherson was certainly a man of high talents , and his poetic powers are honourable to his country . ’ Wilson , in an admirable paper in Blackwood for November 1839 , while admitting many faults in Ossian , eloquently proclaims the presence in his strains of much of the purest , most pathetic , and most sublime poetry , instancing the ‘ Address to the Sun ’ as equal to anything in Homer or Milton . Both these great writers have paid Macpherson a higher compliment still ,— they have imitated him , and the speeches of Allan Macaulay ( a far greater genius than his namesake ) , Ranald MacEagh , and Elspeth MacTavish , in the ‘ Waverley Novels , ’ and such , articles by Christopher North as ‘ Cottages , ’ ‘ Hints for the Holidays , ’ and a ‘ Glance at Selby 's Ornithology , ’ are all coloured by familiarity and fellow-feeling with Ossian 's style . Best of all , the Highlanders as a nation have accepted Ossian as their bard ; he is as much the poet of Morven as Burns of Coila , and it is as hopeless to dislodge the one from the Highland as the other from the Lowland heart . The true way to learn to appreciate Ossian 's poetry is not to hurry , as Macaulay seems to have done , in a steamer from Glasgow to Oban , and thence to Ballachulish , and thence through Glencoe , ( mistaking a fine lake for a ‘ sullen pool ’ on his way , and ignoring altogether its peculiar features of grandeur ,) and thence to Inverness or Edinburgh ; but it is to live for years — as Macpherson did while writing Ossian , and Wilson also did to some extent — under the shadow of the mountains ,— to wander through lonely moors amidst drenching mists and rains ,— to hold trysts with thunder-storms on the summit of savage hills ,— to bathe after nightfall in dreary tarns ,— to lie over the ledge and dip one 's fingers in the spray of cataracts ,— to plough a solitary path into the heart of forests , and to sleep and dream for hours amidst their sunless glades ,— to meet on twilight hills the apparition of the winter moon rising over snowy wastes ,— to descend by her ghastly light precipices where the eagles are sleeping ,— and , returning home , to be haunted by night-visions of mightier mountains , wilder desolations , and giddier descents ;— experience somewhat like this is necessary to form a true ‘ Child of the Mist , ’ and to give the full capacity for sharing in or appreciating the shadowy , solitary , pensive , and magnificent spirit which tabernacles in Ossian 's poetry .</p>
     <p>Never , at least , can we forget how , in our boyhood , while feeling , but quite unable to express , the emotions which were suggested by the bold shapes of mountains resting against the stars , mirrored from below in lakes and wild torrents , and quaking sometimes in concert with the quaking couch of the half-slumbering earthquake , the poems of Ossian served to give our thoughts an expression which they could not otherwise have found — how they at once strengthened and consolidated enthusiasm , and are now regarded with feelings which , wreathed around earliest memories and the strongest fibres of the heart , no criticism can ever weaken or destroy .</p>
     <p>OSSIAN 'S ADDRESS TO THE SUN .</p>
     <p>I feel the sun , O Malvina !— leave me to my rest . Perhaps they may come to my dreams ; I think I hear a feeble voice ! The beam of heaven delights to shine on the grave of Carthon : I feel it warm around .</p>
     <p>O thou that rollest above , round as the shield of my fathers ! Whence are thy beams , O sun ! thy everlasting light ? Thou comest forth in thy awful beauty ; the stars hide themselves in the sky ; the moon , cold and pale , sinks in the western wave ; but thou thyself movest alone . Who can be a companion of thy course ? The oaks of the mountains fall ; the mountains themselves decay with years ; the ocean shrinks and grows again ; the moon herself is lost in heaven , but thou art for ever the same , rejoicing in the brightness of thy course . When the world is dark with tempests , when thunder rolls and lightning flies , thou lookest in thy beauty from the clouds , and laughest at the storm . But to Ossian thou lookest in vain , for he beholds thy beams no more ; whether thy yellow hair flows on the eastern clouds , or thou tremblest at the gates of the west . But thou art perhaps , like me , for a season ; thy years will have an end . Thou shalt sleep in thy clouds careless of the voice of the morning . Exult then , O sun , in the strength of thy youth ! Age is dark and unlovely ; it is like the glimmering light of the moon when it shines through broken clouds , and the mist is on the hills : the blast of the north is on the plain ; the traveller shrinks in the midst of his journey .</p>
     <p>DESOLATION OF BALCLUTHA .</p>
     <p>I have seen the walls of Balclutha , but they were desolate . The fire had resounded in the halls ; and the voice of the people is heard no more . The stream of Clutha was removed from its place by the fall of the walls . The thistle shook there its lonely head ; the moss whistled to the wind . The fox looked out from the windows ; the rank grass of the wall waved round its head . Desolate is the dwelling of Moina ; silence is in the house of her fathers . Raise the song of mourning , O bards ! over the land of strangers . They have but fallen before us : for one day we must fall . Why dost thou build the hall , son of the winged days ? Thou lookest from thy towers to-day : yet a few years , and the blast of the desert comes ; it howls in thy empty court , and whistles round thy half-worn shield . And let the blast of the desert come ! we shall be renowned in our day ! The mark of my arm shall be in battle ; my name in the song of bards . Raise the song , send round the shell : let joy be heard in my hall . When thou , sun of heaven , shalt fail ! if thou shalt fail , thou mighty light ! if thy brightness is but for a season , like Fingal , our fame shall survive thy beams . Such was the song of Fingal in the day of his joy .</p>
     <p>FINGAL AND THE SPIRIT OF LODA .</p>
     <p>Night came down on the sea ; Roma 's bay received the ship . A rock bends along the coast with all its echoing wood . On the top is the circle of Loda , the mossy stone of power ! A narrow plain spreads beneath , covered with grass and aged trees , which the midnight winds , in their wrath , had torn from the shaggy rock . The blue course of a stream is there ! the lonely blast of ocean pursues the thistle 's beard . The flame of three oaks arose : the feast is spread around : but the soul of the king is sad , for Carric-thura 's chief distressed .</p>
     <p>The wan , cold moon , rose in the east ; sleep descended on the youths ! Their blue helmets glitter to the beam ; the fading fire decays . But sleep did not rest on the king : he rose in the midst of his arms , and slowly ascended the hill , to behold the flame of Sarno 's tower .</p>
     <p>The flame was dim and distant , the moon hid her red face in the east . A blast came from the mountain , on its wings was the spirit of Loda . He came to his place in his terrors , and shook his dusky spear . His eyes appear like flames in his dark face ; his voice is like distant thunder . Fingal advanced his spear in night , and raised his voice on high .</p>
     <p>Son of night , retire : call thy winds , and fly ! Why dost thou come to my presence , with thy shadowy arms ? Do I fear thy gloomy form , spirit of dismal Loda ? Weak is thy shield of clouds : feeble is that meteor , thy sword ! The blast rolls them together ; and thou thyself art lost . Fly from my presence , son of night ! Call thy winds , and fly !</p>
     <p>Dost thou force me from my place ? replied the hollow voice . The people bend before me . I turn the battle in the field of the brave . I look on the nations , and they vanish : my nostrils pour the blast of death . I come abroad on the winds : the tempests are before my face . But my dwelling is calm , above the clouds ; the fields of my rest are pleasant .</p>
     <p>Dwell in thy pleasant fields , said the king ; let Comhal 's son be forgot . Do my steps ascend , from my hills , into thy peaceful plains ? Do I meet thee , with a spear , on thy cloud , spirit of dismal Loda ? Why then dost thou frown on me ? Why shake thine airy spear ? Thou frownest in vain : I never fled from the mighty in war . And shall the sons of the wind frighten the king of Morven ? No : he knows the weakness of their arms !</p>
     <p>Fly to thy land , replied the form : receive the wind , and fly ! The blasts are in the hollow of my hand : the course of the storm is mine . The king of Sora is my son , he bends at the storm of my power . His battle is around Carric-thura ; and he will prevail ! Fly to thy land , son of Comhal , or feel my flaming wrath !</p>
     <p>He lifted high his shadowy spear ! He bent forward his dreadful height . Fingal , advancing , drew his sword ; the blade of dark-brown Luno . The gleaming path of the steel winds through the gloomy ghost . The form fell shapeless into air , like a column of smoke , which the staff of the boy disturbs , as it rises from the half-extinguished furnace .</p>
     <p>The spirit of Loda shrieked , as , rolled into himself , he rose on the wind . Inistore shook at the sound , the waves heard it on the deep . They stopped in their course with fear : the friends of Fingal started at once , and took their heavy spears . They missed the king ; they rose in rage ; all their arms resound !</p>
     <p>ADDRESS TO THE MOON .</p>
     <p>Daughter of heaven , fair art thou ! the silence of thy face is pleasant ! Thou comest forth in loveliness . The stars attend thy blue course in the east . The clouds rejoice in thy presence , O moon ! they brighten their dark-brown sides . Who is like thee in heaven , light of the silent night ? The stars are ashamed in thy presence . They turn away their sparkling eyes . Whither dost thou retire from thy course , when the darkness of thy countenance grows ? hast thou thy hall , like Ossian ? dwellest thou in the shadow of grief ? have thy sisters fallen from heaven ? are they who rejoiced with thee at night no more ? Yes , they have fallen , fair light ! and thou dost often retire to mourn . But thou thyself shalt fail one night , and leave thy blue path in heaven . The stars will then lift their heads : they , who were ashamed in thy presence , will rejoice . Thou art now clothed with thy brightness . Look from thy gates in the sky . Burst the cloud , O wind ! that the daughter of night may look forth ! that the shaggy mountains may brighten , and the ocean roll its white waves in light .</p>
     <p>FINGAL 'S SPIRIT-HOME .</p>
     <p>His friends sit around the king , on mist ! They hear the songs of Ullin : he strikes the half-viewless harp . He raises the feeble voice . The lesser heroes , with a thousand meteors , light the airy hall . Malvina rises in the midst ; a blush is on her cheek . She beholds the unknown faces of her fathers . She turns aside her humid eyes . ‘ Art thou come so soon ? ’ said Fingal , ‘ daughter of generous Toscar . Sadness dwells in the halls of Lutha . My aged son is sad ! I hear the breeze of Cona , that was wont to lift thy heavy locks . It comes to the hall , but thou art not there . Its voice is mournful among the arms of thy fathers ! Go , with thy rustling wing , O breeze ! sigh on Malvina 's tomb . It rises yonder beneath the rock , at the blue stream of Lutha . The maids are departed to their place . Thou alone , O breeze , mournest there ! ’</p>

      <head>WILLIAM MASON .</head>
      <head>This gentleman is now nearly forgotten , except as the friend , biographer , and literary executor of Gray . He was born in 1725 , and died in 1797 . His tragedies , ‘ Elfrida ’ and ‘ Caractacus , ’ are spirited declamations in dramatic form , not dramas . His odes have the turgidity without the grandeur of Gray 's . His ‘ English Garden ’ is too long and too formal . His Life of Gray was an admirable innovation on the form of biography then prevalent , interspersing , as it does , journals and letters with mere narrative . Mason was a royal chaplain , held the living of Ashton , and was precentor of York Cathedral . We quote the best of his minor poems .</head>

     <p>JOHN LOWE .</p>
     <p>The author of ‘ Mary 's Dream ’ was born in 1750 , at Kenmore , Galloway , and was the son of a gardener . He became a student of divinity , and acted as tutor in the family of a Mr McGhie of Airds . A daughter of Mr McGhie was attached to a gentleman named Miller , a surgeon at sea , and on the occasion of his death Lowe wrote his beautiful ‘ Mary 's Dream , ’ the exquisite simplicity and music of the first stanza of which has often been admired . Lowe was betrothed to a sister of ‘ Mary , ’ but having emigrated to America , he married another , fell into dissipated habits , and died in a miserable plight at Fredericksburgh in 1798 . He wrote many other pieces , but none equal to ‘ Mary 's Dream . ’</p>

He was in due time removed to Oriel College , where he composed two poems , entitled ‘ The Enthusiast , ’ and ‘ The Dying Indian . ’ In 1744 , he took the degree of Bachelor of Arts at Oxford , and was ordained to his father 's curacy at Basingstoke . He went thence to Chelsea , but did not remain there long , owing to some disagreement with his parishioners , and returned to Basingstoke . In 1746 , he published a volume of Odes , and in the preface expressed his hope that it might be successful as an attempt to bring poetry back from the didactic and satirical taste of the age , to the truer channels of fancy and description . The motive of this attempt was , however , more praiseworthy than its success was conspicuous .</p>
     <p>In 1748 , Warton was presented by the Duke of Bolton to the rectory of Winslade , and he straightway married a Miss Daman , to whom he had for some time been attached . In the same year he began , and in 1753 he finished and printed , an edition of Virgil in English and Latin . Of this large , elaborate work , Warton himself supplied only the life of Virgil , with three essays on pastoral , didactic , and epic poetry , and a poetical version of the Eclogues and the Georgics , more correct but less spirited than Dryden 's . He adopted Pitt 's version of the Aeneid , and his friends furnished some of the dissertations , notes , &amp; c. Shortly after , he contributed twenty-four excellent papers , including some striking allegories , and some good criticisms on Shakspeare , to the Adventurer . In 1754 , he was appointed to the living of Tunworth , and the next year was elected second master of Winchester School . Soon after this he published anonymously ‘ An Essay on the Writings and Genius of Pope , ’ which , whether because he failed in convincing the public that his estimate of Pope was the correct one , or because he stood in awe of Warburton , he did not complete or reprint for twenty-six years . It is a somewhat gossiping book , but full of information and interest .</p>
     <p>In May 1766 , he was made head-master of Winchester . In 1768 , he lost his wife , and next year married a Miss Nicholas of Winchester . In 1782 , he was promoted , through Bishop Lowth , to a prebend 's post in St Paul 's , and to the living of Thorley , which he exchanged for that of Wickham . Other livings dropped in upon him , and in 1793 he resigned the mastership of Winchester , and went to reside at Wickham . Here he employed himself in preparing an edition of Pope , which he published in 1797 . In 1800 he died .</p>
     <p>Warton , like his brother , did good service in resisting the literary despotism of Pope , and in directing the attention of the public to the forgotten treasures of old English poetry . He was a man of extensive learning , a very fair and candid , as well as acute critic , and his ‘ Ode to Fancy ’ proves him to have possessed no ordinary genius .</p>

       <l n="1">O parent of each lovely Muse ,</l>
       <l n="2">Thy spirit o'er my soul diffuse ,</l>
       <l n="3">O'er all my artless songs preside ,</l>
       <l n="4">My footsteps to thy temple guide ,</l>
       <l n="5">To offer at thy turf-built shrine ,</l>
       <l n="6">In golden cups no costly wine ,</l>
       <l n="7">No murdered fatling of the flock ,</l>
       <l n="8">But flowers and honey from the rock .</l>

       <l n="10">With buskined leg , and bosom bare ,</l>
       <l n="11">Thy waist with myrtle-girdle bound ,</l>
       <l n="12">Thy brows with Indian feathers crowned ,</l>
       <l n="13">Waving in thy snowy hand</l>
       <l n="14">An all-commanding magic wand ,</l>
       <l n="15">Of power to bid fresh gardens blow ,</l>
       <l n="16">‘ Mid cheerless Lapland 's barren snow ,</l>
       <l n="17">Whose rapid wings thy flight convey</l>
       <l n="18">Through air , and over earth and sea ,</l>
       <l n="19">While the vast various landscape lies</l>
       <l n="20">Conspicuous to thy piercing eyes .</l>
       <l n="21">O lover of the desert , hail !</l>
       <l n="22">Say , in what deep and pathless vale ,</l>
       <l n="23">Or on what hoary mountain 's side ,</l>
       <l n="24">‘ Mid fall of waters , you reside ,</l>
       <l n="25">‘ Mid broken rocks , a rugged scene ,</l>
       <l n="26">With green and grassy dales between ,</l>
       <l n="27">‘ Mid forests dark of aged oak ,</l>
       <l n="28">Ne'er echoing with the woodman 's stroke ,</l>
       <l n="29">Where never human art appeared ,</l>
       <l n="30">Nor even one straw-roofed cot was reared ,</l>
       <l n="31">Where Nature seems to sit alone ,</l>
       <l n="32">Majestic on a craggy throne ;</l>
       <l n="33">Tell me the path , sweet wanderer , tell ,</l>
       <l n="34">To thy unknown sequestered cell ,</l>
       <l n="35">Where woodbines cluster round the door ,</l>
       <l n="36">Where shells and moss o'erlay the floor ,</l>
       <l n="37">And on whose top a hawthorn blows ,</l>
       <l n="38">Amid whose thickly-woven boughs</l>
       <l n="39">Some nightingale still builds her nest ,</l>
       <l n="40">Each evening warbling thee to rest :</l>
       <l n="41">Then lay me by the haunted stream ,</l>
       <l n="42">Rapt in some wild , poetic dream ,</l>
       <l n="43">In converse while methinks I rove</l>
       <l n="44">With Spenser through a fairy grove ;</l>
       <l n="45">Till , suddenly awaked , I hear</l>
       <l n="46">Strange whispered music in my ear ,</l>
       <l n="47">And my glad soul in bliss is drowned</l>
       <l n="48">By the sweetly-soothing sound !</l>
       <l n="49">Me , goddess , by the right hand lead</l>
       <l n="50">Sometimes through the yellow mead ,</l>
       <l n="51">Where Joy and white-robed Peace resort ,</l>
       <l n="52">And Venus keeps her festive court ;</l>
       <l n="53">Where Mirth and Youth each evening meet ,</l>
       <l n="54">And lightly trip with nimble feet ,</l>
       <l n="55">Nodding their lily-crowned heads ,</l>
       <l n="56">Where Laughter rose-lipped Hebe leads ;</l>
       <l n="57">Where Echo walks steep hills among ,</l>
       <l n="58">Listening to the shepherd 's song :</l>
       <l n="59">Yet not these flowery fields of joy</l>
       <l n="60">Can long my pensive mind employ ;</l>
       <l n="61">Haste , Fancy , from the scenes of folly ,</l>
       <l n="62">To meet the matron Melancholy ,</l>
       <l n="63">Goddess of the tearful eye ,</l>

       <l n="65">Let us with silent footsteps go</l>
       <l n="66">To charnels and the house of woe ,</l>
       <l n="67">To Gothic churches , vaults , and tombs ,</l>
       <l n="68">Where each sad night some virgin comes ,</l>
       <l n="69">With throbbing breast , and faded cheek ,</l>
       <l n="70">Her promised bridegroom 's urn to seek ;</l>
       <l n="71">Or to some abbey 's mouldering towers ,</l>
       <l n="72">Where , to avoid cold wintry showers ,</l>
       <l n="73">The naked beggar shivering lies ,</l>
       <l n="74">While whistling tempests round her rise ,</l>
       <l n="75">And trembles lest the tottering wall</l>
       <l n="76">Should on her sleeping infants fall .</l>
       <l n="77">Now let us louder strike the lyre ,</l>
       <l n="78">For my heart glows with martial fire ,—</l>
       <l n="79">I feel , I feel , with sudden heat ,</l>
       <l n="80">My big tumultuous bosom beat ;</l>

       <l n="82">A thousand widows ’ shrieks I hear ,</l>
       <l n="83">Give me another horse , I cry ,</l>
       <l n="84">Lo ! the base Gallic squadrons fly ;</l>
       <l n="85">Whence is this rage ?— what spirit , say ,</l>
       <l n="86">To battle hurries me away ?</l>
       <l n="87">‘ Tis Fancy , in her fiery car ,</l>
       <l n="88">Transports me to the thickest war ,</l>
       <l n="89">There whirls me o'er the hills of slain ,</l>
       <l n="90">Where Tumult and Destruction reign ;</l>
       <l n="91">Where , mad with pain , the wounded steed</l>
       <l n="92">Tramples the dying and the dead ;</l>

       <l n="110">To Summer tells her tender tale ;</l>
       <l n="111">When Autumn cooling caverns seeks ,</l>
       <l n="112">And stains with wine his jolly cheeks ;</l>
       <l n="113">When Winter , like poor pilgrim old ,</l>
       <l n="114">Shakes his silver beard with cold ;</l>

       <l n="121">Ne'er may I strive with lips profane</l>
       <l n="122">To utter an unhallowed strain ,</l>
       <l n="123">Nor dare to touch the sacred string ,</l>
       <l n="124">Save when with smiles thou bidst me sing .</l>
