    <docTitle><titlePart>LOVE IS ENOUGH POEMS BY THE WAY FROM THE UPLAND TO THE SEA Shall we wake one morn of spring , Glad at heart of everything , Yet pensive with the thought of eve ? Then the white house shall we leave . Pass the wind-flowers and the bays , Through the garth , and go our ways , Wandering down among the meads Till our very joyance needs Rest at last ; till we shall come To that Sun-god 's lonely home , Lonely on the hillside grey , Whence the sheep have gone away ; Lonely till the feast-time is , When with prayer and praise of bliss , Thither comes the country side . There awhile shall we abide , Sitting low down in the porch By that image with the torch : Thy one white hand laid upon The black pillar that was won From the far-off Indian mine ; And my hand nigh touching thine , But not touching ; and thy gown Fair with spring-flowers cast adown From thy bosom and thy brow . There the south-west wind shall blow Through thine hair to reach my cheek , As thou sittest , nor mayst speak , Nor mayst move the hand I kiss For the very depth of bliss ; Nay , nor turn thine eyes to me . Then desire of the great sea Nigh enow , but all unheard , In the hearts of us is stirred , And we rise , we twain at last , And the daffodils downcast , Feel thy feet and we are gone From the lonely Sun-Crowned one , Then the meads fade at our back , And the spring day ‘ gins to lack That fresh hope that once it had ; But we twain grow yet more glad , And apart no more may go When the grassy slope and low Dieth in the shingly sand : Then we wander hand in hand By the edges of the sea , And I weary more for thee Than if far apart we were , With a space of desert drear ‘ Twixt thy lips and mine , O love ! Ah , my joy , my joy thereof !</titlePart></docTitle>

    <head>OF THE WOOING OF HALLBIORN THE STRONG</head>
    <head>A STORY FROM THE LAND-SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND , CHAPTER XXX .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">At Deildar-Tongue in the autumn-tide ,</l>
     <l n="2">So many times over comes summer again ,</l>
     <l n="3">Stood Odd of Tongue his door beside .</l>
     <l n="4">What healing in summer if winter be vain ?</l>
     <l n="5">Dim and dusk the day was grown ,</l>
     <l n="6">As he heard his folded wethers moan .</l>
     <l n="7">Then through the garth a man drew near ,</l>
     <l n="8">With painted shield and gold-wrought spear .</l>
     <l n="9">Good was his horse and grand his gear ,</l>
     <l n="10">And his girths were wet with Whitewater .</l>
     <l n="11">“ Hail , Master Odd , live blithe and long !</l>
     <l n="12">How fare the folk at Deildar-Tongue ? ”</l>
     <l n="13">“ All hail , thou Hallbiorn the Strong !</l>
     <l n="14">How fare the folk by the Brothers ’ - Tongue ? ”</l>
     <l n="15">“ Meat have we there , and drink and fire ,</l>
     <l n="16">Nor lack all things that we desire .</l>
     <l n="17">But by the other Whitewater</l>
     <l n="18">Of Hallgerd many a tale we hear . ”</l>
     <l n="19">“ Tales enow may my daughter make</l>
     <l n="20">If too many words be said for her sake . ”</l>
     <l n="21">“ What saith thine heart to a word of mine ,</l>
     <l n="22">That I deem thy daughter fair and fine ?</l>
     <l n="23">Fair and fine for a bride is she ,</l>
     <l n="24">And I fain would have her home with me . ”</l>
     <l n="25">“ Full many a word that at noon goes forth</l>
     <l n="26">Comes home at even little worth .</l>
     <l n="27">Now winter treadeth on autumn-tide ,</l>
     <l n="28">So here till the spring shalt thou abide .</l>
     <l n="29">Then if thy mind be changed no whit .</l>
     <l n="30">And ye still will wed , see ye to it !</l>
     <l n="31">And on the first of summer days ,</l>
     <l n="32">A wedded man , ye may go your ways .</l>
     <l n="33">Yet look , howso the thing will fall ,</l>
     <l n="34">My hand shall meddle nought at all .</l>
     <l n="35">Lo , now the night and rain draweth up .</l>
     <l n="36">And within doors glimmer stoop and cup .</l>
     <l n="37">And hark , a little sound I know ,</l>
     <l n="38">The laugh of Snæbiorn 's fiddle-bow ,</l>
     <l n="39">My sister 's son , and a craftsman good ,</l>
     <l n="40">When the red rain drives through the iron wood . ”</l>
     <l n="41">Hallbiorn laughed , and followed in ,</l>
     <l n="42">And a merry feast there did begin .</l>
     <l n="43">Hallgerd 's hands undid his weed ,</l>
     <l n="44">Hallgerd 's hands poured out the mead .</l>
     <l n="45">Her fingers at his breast he felt ,</l>
     <l n="46">As her hair fell down about his belt .</l>
     <l n="47">Her fingers with the cup he took ,</l>
     <l n="48">And o'er its rim at her did look .</l>
     <l n="49">Cold cup , warm hand , and fingers slim .</l>
     <l n="50">Before his eyes were waxen dim .</l>
     <l n="51">And if the feast were foul or fair ,</l>
     <l n="52">He knew not , save that she was there .</l>
     <l n="53">He knew not if men laughed or wept ,</l>
     <l n="54">While still ‘ twixt wall and daïs she stept .</l>
     <l n="55">Whether she went or stood that eve ,</l>
     <l n="56">Not once his eyes her face did leave .</l>
     <l n="57">But Snæbiorn laughed and Snæbiorn sang ,</l>
     <l n="58">And sweet his smitten fiddle rang .</l>
     <l n="59">And Hallgerd stood beside him there ,</l>
     <l n="60">So many times over comes summer again</l>
     <l n="61">Nor ever once he turned to her ,</l>
     <l n="62">What healing in summer if winter be vain ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="63">Master Odd on the morrow spake ,</l>
     <l n="64">So many times over comes summer again .</l>
     <l n="65">“ Hearken , O guest , if ye be awake , ”</l>
     <l n="66">What healing in summer if winter be vain ?</l>
     <l n="67">“ Sure ye champions of the south</l>
     <l n="68">Speak many things from a silent mouth .</l>
     <l n="69">And thine , meseems , last night did pray</l>
     <l n="70">That ye might well be wed to-day .</l>
     <l n="71">The year 's ingathering feast it is ,</l>
     <l n="72">A goodly day to give thee bliss .</l>
     <l n="73">Come hither , daughter , fine and fair ,</l>
     <l n="74">Here is a wooer from Whitewater .</l>
     <l n="75">Fast away hath he gotten fame ,</l>
     <l n="76">And his father 's name is e'en my name .</l>
     <l n="77">Will ye lay hand within his hand ,</l>
     <l n="78">That blossoming fair our house may stand ? ”</l>
     <l n="79">She laid her hand within his hand ;</l>
     <l n="80">White she was as the lily wand .</l>
     <l n="81">Low sang Snæbiorn 's brand in its sheath ,</l>
     <l n="82">And his lips were waxen grey as death .</l>
     <l n="83">“ Snæbiorn , sing us a song of worth .</l>
     <l n="84">If your song must be silent from now henceforth .</l>
     <l n="85">Clear and loud his voice outrang ,</l>
     <l n="86">And a song of worth at the wedding he sang .</l>
     <l n="87">“ Sharp sword , ” he sang , “ and death is sure . ”</l>
     <l n="88">So many times over comes summer again ,</l>
     <l n="89">“ But love doth over all endure . ”</l>
     <l n="90">What healing in summer if winter be vain ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="91">Now winter cometh and weareth away ,</l>
     <l n="92">So many times over comes summer again ,</l>
     <l n="93">And glad is Hallbiorn many a day .</l>
     <l n="94">What healing in summer if winter be vain ?</l>
     <l n="95">Full soft he lay his love beside ;</l>
     <l n="96">But dark are the days of winter-tide .</l>
     <l n="97">Dark are the days , and the nights are long ,</l>
     <l n="98">And sweet and fair was Snæbiorn 's song .</l>
     <l n="99">Many a time he talked with her ,</l>
     <l n="100">Till they deemed the summer-tide was there .</l>
     <l n="101">And they forgat the wind-swept ways</l>
     <l n="102">And angry fords of the flitting-days .</l>
     <l n="103">While the north wind swept the hillside there</l>
     <l n="104">They forgat the other Whitewater .</l>
     <l n="105">While nights at Deildar-Tongue were long ,</l>
     <l n="106">They clean forgat the Brothers ’ - Tongue .</l>
     <l n="107">But whatso falleth ‘ twixt Hell and Home ,</l>
     <l n="108">So many times over comes summer again ,</l>
     <l n="109">Full surely again shall summer come .</l>
     <l n="110">What healing in summer if winter be vain ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="111">To Odd spake Hallbiorn on a day</l>
     <l n="112">So many times over comes summer again ,</l>
     <l n="113">“ Gone is the snow from everyway . ”</l>
     <l n="114">What healing in summer if winter be vain ?</l>
     <l n="115">“ Now green is grown Whitewater-side ,</l>
     <l n="116">And I to Whitewater will ride . ”</l>
     <l n="117">Quoth Odd , “ Well fare thou winter-guest ,</l>
     <l n="118">May thine own Whitewater be best</l>
     <l n="119">Well is a man 's purse better at home</l>
     <l n="120">Than open where folk go and come . ”</l>
     <l n="121">“ Come ye carles of the south country ,</l>
     <l n="122">Now shall we go our kin to see !</l>
     <l n="123">For the lambs are bleating in the south ,</l>
     <l n="124">And the salmon swims towards Olfus mouth ,</l>
     <l n="125">Girth and graithe and gather your gear !</l>
     <l n="126">And ho for the other Whitewater ! ”</l>
     <l n="127">Bright was the moon as bright might be ,</l>
     <l n="128">And Snæbiorn rode to the north country .</l>
     <l n="129">And Odd to Reykholt is gone forth ,</l>
     <l n="130">To see if his mares be ought of worth .</l>
     <l n="131">But Hallbiorn into the bower is gone</l>
     <l n="132">And there sat Hallgerd all alone .</l>
     <l n="133">She was not dight to go nor ride ,</l>
     <l n="134">She had no joy of the summer-tide .</l>
     <l n="135">Silent she sat and combed her hair ,</l>
     <l n="136">That fell all round about her there .</l>
     <l n="137">The slant beam lay upon her head ,</l>
     <l n="138">And gilt her golden locks to red .</l>
     <l n="139">He gazed at her with hungry eyes</l>
     <l n="140">And fluttering did his heart arise .</l>
     <l n="141">“ Full hot , ” he said , “ is the sun to-day ,</l>
     <l n="142">And the snow is gone from the mountain-way</l>
     <l n="143">The king-cup grows above the grass ,</l>
     <l n="144">And through the wood do the thrushes pass . ”</l>
     <l n="145">Of all his words she hearkened none ,</l>
     <l n="146">But combed her hair amidst the sun .</l>
     <l n="147">“ The laden beasts stand in the garth</l>
     <l n="148">And their heads are turned to Helliskarth . ”</l>
     <l n="149">The sun was falling on her knee ,</l>
     <l n="150">And she combed her gold hair silently .</l>
     <l n="151">“ To-morrow great will be the cheer</l>
     <l n="152">At the Brothers ’ - Tongue by Whitewater . ”</l>
     <l n="153">From her folded lap the sunbeam slid ;</l>
     <l n="154">She combed her hair , and the word she hid .</l>
     <l n="155">“ Come , love ; is the way so long and drear</l>
     <l n="156">From Whitewater to Whitewater ? ”</l>
     <l n="157">The sunbeam lay upon the floor ;</l>
     <l n="158">She combed her hair and spake no more .</l>
     <l n="159">He drew her by the lily hand :</l>
     <l n="160">“ I love thee better than all the land . ”</l>
     <l n="161">He drew her by the shoulders sweet :</l>
     <l n="162">“ My threshold is but for thy feet . ”</l>
     <l n="163">He drew her by the yellow hair :</l>
     <l n="164">“ O why wert thou so deadly fair ?</l>
     <l n="165">O am I wedded to death ? ” he cried ,</l>
     <l n="166">“ Is the Dead-strand come to Whitewater side ? ”</l>
     <l n="167">And the sun was fading from the room ,</l>
     <l n="168">But her eyes were bright in the change and the gloom .</l>

   <p>ICELAND FIRST SEEN</p>
   <p>Lo from our loitering ship a new land at last to be seen ; Toothed rocks down the side of the firth on the east guard a weary wide lea , And black slope the hillsides above , striped adown with their desolate green : And a peak rises up on the west from the meeting of cloud and of sea , Foursquare from base unto point like the building of Gods that have been , The last of that waste of the mountains all cloud-wreathed and snow-flecked and grey , And bright with the dawn that began just now at the ending of day .</p>
   <p>Ah ! what came we forth for to see that our hearts are so hot with desire ? Is it enough for our rest , the sight of this desolate strand , And the mountain-waste voiceless as death but for winds that may sleep not nor tire ? Why do we long to wend forth through the length and breadth of a land , Dreadful with grinding of ice , and record of scarce hidden fire , But that there ‘ mid the grey grassy dales sore scarred by the ruining streams Lives the tale of the Northland of old and the undying glory of dreams ?</p>
   <p>O land , as some cave by the sea where the treasures of old have been laid , The sword it may be of a king whose name was the turning of fight : Or the staff of some wise of the world that many things made and unmade . Or the ring of a woman maybe whose woe is grown wealth and delight . No wheat and no wine grows above it , no orchard for blossom and shade ; The few ships that sail by its blackness but deem it the mouth of a grave ; Yet sure when the world shall awaken , this too shall be mighty to save .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Or rather , O land , if a marvel</l>
     <l n="2">it seemeth that men ever sought</l>
     <l n="3">Thy wastes for a field and a garden</l>
     <l n="4">fulfilled of all wonder and doubt ,</l>
     <l n="5">And feasted amidst of the winter</l>
     <l n="6">when the fight of the year had been fought ,</l>
     <l n="7">Whose plunder all gathered together</l>
     <l n="8">was little to babble about ;</l>
     <l n="9">Cry aloud from thy wastes , O thou land ,</l>
     <l n="10">“ Not for this nor for that was I wrought</l>
     <l n="11">Amid waning of realms and of riches</l>
     <l n="12">and death of things worshipped and sure ,</l>
     <l n="13">I abide here the spouse of a God ,</l>
     <l n="14">and I made and I make and endure . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>O Queen of the grief without knowledge , of the courage that may not avail , Of the longing that may not attain , of the love that shall never forget , More joy than the gladness of laughter thy voice hath amidst of its wail : More hope than of pleasure fulfilled amidst of thy blindness is set ; More glorious than gaining of all thine unfaltering hand that shall fail : For what is the mark on thy brow but the brand that thy Brynhild doth bear ? Lone once , and loved and undone by a love that no ages outwear .</p>
   <p>Ah ! when thy Balder comes back , and bears from the heart of the Sun Peace and the healing of pain , and the wisdom that waiteth no more ; And the lilies are laid on thy brow ‘ mid the crown of the deeds thou hast done ; And the roses spring up by thy feet that the rocks of the wilderness wore . Ah ! when thy Balder comes back and we gather the gains he hath won , Shall we not linger a little to talk of thy sweetness of old , Yea , turn back awhile to thy travail whence the Gods stood aloof to behold ?</p>

    <head>MOTHER AND SON</head>
    <head>Now sleeps the land of houses , and dead night holds the street , And there thou liest , my baby , and sleepest soft and sweet ; My man is away for awhile , but safe and alone we lie , And none heareth thy breath but thy mother , and the moon looking down from the sky On the weary waste of the town , as it looked on the grass-edged road Still warm with yesterday 's sun , when I left my old abode ; Hand in hand with my love , that night of all nights in the year ; When the river of love o'erflowed and drowned all doubt and fear , And we two were alone in the world , and once if never again , We knew of the secret of earth and the tale of its labour and pain .</head>

   <p>Yet , yet the tears on my cheek ! and what is this doth move My heart to thy heart , beloved , save the flood of yearning love ? For fair and fierce is thy father , and soft and strange are his eyes That look on the days that shall be with the hope of the brave and the wise . It was many a day that we laughed , as over the meadows we walked , And many a day I hearkened and the pictures came as he talked ; It was many a day that we longed , and we lingered late at eve Ere speech from speech was sundered , and my hand his hand could leave . Then I wept when I was alone , and I longed till the daylight came ; And down the stairs I stole , and there was our housekeeping dame ( No mother of me , the foundling ) kindling the fire betimes Ere the haymaking folk went forth to the meadows down by the limes ; All things I saw at a glance ; the quickening fire-tongues leapt Through the crackling heap of sticks , and the sweet smoke up from it crept , And close to the very hearth the low sun flooded the floor , And the cat and her kittens played in the sun by the open door . The garden was fair in the morning , and there in the road he stood Beyond the crimson daisies and the bush of southernwood . Then side by side together through the grey-walled place we went , And O the fear departed , and the rest and sweet content !</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Son , sorrow and wisdom he taught me ,</l>
     <l n="2">and sore I grieved and learned</l>
     <l n="3">As we twain grew into one ;</l>
     <l n="4">and the heart within me burned</l>
     <l n="5">With the very hopes of his heart .</l>
     <l n="6">Ah , son , it is piteous ,</l>
     <l n="7">But never again in my life</l>
     <l n="8">shall I dare to speak to thee thus ;</l>
     <l n="9">So may these lonely words</l>
     <l n="10">about thee creep and cling ,</l>
     <l n="11">These words of the lonely night</l>
     <l n="12">in the days of our wayfaring .</l>
     <l n="13">Many a child of woman</l>
     <l n="14">to-night is born in the town ,</l>
     <l n="15">The desert of folly and wrong ;</l>

     <l n="33">And all these are the good and the happy ,</l>
     <l n="34">on whom the world dawns fair .</l>
     <l n="35">O son , when wilt thou learn</l>
     <l n="36">of those that are born of despair ,</l>
     <l n="37">As the fabled mud of the Nile</l>
     <l n="38">that quickens under the sun</l>
     <l n="39">With a growth of creeping things ,</l>
     <l n="40">half dead when just begun ?</l>
     <l n="41">E'en such is the care of Nature</l>
     <l n="42">that man should never die ,</l>
     <l n="43">Though she breed of the fools of the earth ,</l>
     <l n="44">and the dregs of the city sty .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>But thou , O son , O son , of very love wert born , When our hope fulfilled bred hope , and fear was a folly outworn . On the eve of the toil and the battle all sorrow and grief we weighed , We hoped and we were not ashamed , we knew and we were not afraid .</p>
   <p>Now waneth the night and the moon ; ah , son , it is piteous That never again in my life shall I dare to speak to thee thus . But sure from the wise and the simple shall the mighty come to birth ; And fair were my fate , beloved , if I be yet on the earth When the world is awaken at last , and from mouth to mouth they tell Of thy love and thy deeds and thy valour , and thy hope that nought can quell .</p>

   <p>GUNNAR 'S HOWE ABOVE THE HOUSE AT LITHEND</p>
   <p>Ye who have come o'er the sea to behold this grey minster of lands , Whose floor is the tomb of time past , and whose walls by the toil of dead hands Show pictures amidst of the ruin of deeds that have overpast death , Stay by this tomb in a tomb to ask of who lieth beneath . Ah ! the world changeth too soon , that ye stand there with unbated breath , As I name him that Gunnar of old , who erst in the haymaking tide Felt all the land fragrant and fresh , as amidst of the edges he died . Too swiftly fame fadeth away , if ye tremble not lest once again The grey mound should open and show him glad-eyed without grudging or pain . Little labour methinks to behold him but the tale-teller laboured in vain . Little labour for ears that may hearken to hear his death-conquering song , Till the heart swells to think of the gladness undying that overcame wrong . O young is the world yet meseemeth and the hope of it flourishing green , When the words of a man unremembered so bridge all the days that have been , As we look round about on the land that these nine hundred years he hath seen .</p>
   <p>Dusk is abroad on the grass of this valley amidst of the hill : Dusk that shall never be dark till the dawn hard on midnight shall fill The trench under Eyiafell 's snow , and the grey plain the sea meeteth grey . White , high aloft hangs the moon that no dark night shall brighten ere day , For here day and night toileth the summer lest deedless his time pass away .</p>
   <p>THE DAY IS COMING</p>
   <p>Come hither , lads , and hearken , for a tale there is to tell , Of the wonderful days a-coming , when all shall be better than well .</p>
   <p>And the tale shall be told of a country , a land in the midst of the sea , And folk shall call it England in the days that are going to be .</p>
   <p>There more than one in a thousand in the days that are yet to come , Shall have some hope of the morrow , some joy of the ancient home .</p>
   <p>For then , laugh not , but listen to this strange tale of mine , All folk that are in England shall be better lodged than swine .</p>
   <p>Then a man shall work and bethink him , and rejoice in the deeds of his hand , Nor yet come home in the even too faint and weary to stand .</p>
   <p>Men in that time a-coming shall work and have no fear For to-morrow 's lack of earning and the hunger-wolf anear .</p>
   <p>I tell you this for a wonder , that no man then shall be glad Of his fellow 's fall and mishap to snatch at the work he had .</p>
   <p>For that which the worker winneth shall then be his indeed , Nor shall half be reaped for nothing by him that sowed no seed .</p>
   <p>O strange new wonderful justice ! But for whom shall we gather the gain ? For ourselves and for each of our fellows , and no hand shall labour in vain .</p>
   <p>Then all Mine and all Thine shall be Ours , and no more shall any man crave For riches that serve for nothing but to fetter a friend for a slave .</p>
   <p>And what wealth then shall be left us when none shall gather gold To buy his friend in the market , and pinch and pine the sold ?</p>
   <p>Nay , what save the lovely city , and the little house on the hill , And the wastes and the woodland beauty , and the happy fields we till ;</p>
   <p>And the homes of ancient stories , the tombs of the mighty dead ; And the wise men seeking out marvels , and the poet 's teeming head ;</p>
   <p>And the painter 's hand of wonder ; and the marvellous fiddle-bow , And the banded choirs of music : all those that do and know .</p>
   <p>For all these shall be ours and all men 's , nor shall any lack a share Of the toil and the gain of living in the days when the world grows fair .</p>
   <p>Ah ! such are the days that shall be ! But what are the deeds of to-day In the days of the years we dwell in , that wear our lives away ?</p>
   <p>Why , then , and for what are we waiting ? There are three words to speak ; WE WILL IT , and what is the foeman but the dream-strong wakened and weak ?</p>
   <p>O why and for what are we waiting ? while our brothers droop and die , And on every wind of the heavens a wasted life goes by .</p>
   <p>How long shall they reproach us where crowd on crowd they dwell , Poor ghosts of the wicked city , the gold-crushed hungry hell ?</p>
   <p>Through squalid life they laboured , in sordid grief they died , Those sons of a mighty mother , those props of England 's pride .</p>
   <p>They are gone ; there is none can undo it , nor save our souls from the curse ; But many a million cometh , and shall they be better or worse ?</p>
   <p>It is we must answer and hasten , and open wide the door For the rich man 's hurrying terror , and the slow-foot hope of the poor .</p>
   <p>Yea , the voiceless wrath of the wretched , and their unlearned discontent , We must give it voice and wisdom till the waiting-tide be spent .</p>
   <p>Come , then , since all things call us , the living and the dead , And o'er the weltering tangle a glimmering light is shed .</p>
   <p>Come , then , let us cast off fooling , and put by ease and rest , For the Cause alone is worthy till the good days bring the best .</p>
   <p>Come , join in the only battle wherein no man can fail , Where whoso fadeth and dieth , yet his deed shall still prevail .</p>
   <p>Ah ! come , cast off all fooling , for this , at least , we know : That the Dawn and the Day is coming , and forth the Banners go .</p>

   <p>ALL FOR THE CAUSE</p>
   <p>Hear a word , a word in season , for the day is drawing nigh , When the Cause shall call upon us , some to live , and some to die !</p>
   <p>He that dies shall not die lonely , many an one hath gone before ; He that lives shall bear no burden heavier than the life they bore .</p>
   <p>Nothing ancient is their story , e'en but yesterday they bled , Youngest they of earth 's beloved , last of all the valiant dead .</p>
   <p>E'en the tidings we are telling was the tale they had to tell , E'en the hope that our hearts cherish , was the hope for which they fell .</p>
   <p>In the grave where tyrants thrust them , lies their labour and their pain , But undying from their sorrow springeth up the hope again .</p>
   <p>Mourn not therefore , nor lament it , that the world outlives their life ; Voice and vision yet they give us , making strong our hands for strife .</p>
   <p>Some had name , and fame , and honour , learn 'd they were , and wise and strong ; Some were nameless , poor , unlettered , weak in all but grief and wrong .</p>
   <p>Named and nameless all live in us ; one and all they lead us yet Every pain to count for nothing , every sorrow to forget .</p>
   <p>Hearken how they cry , “ O happy , happy ye that ye were born In the sad slow night 's departing , in the rising of the morn .</p>
   <p>“ Fair the crown the Cause hath for you , well to die or well to live Through the battle , through the tangle , peace to gain or peace to give . ”</p>
   <p>Ah , it may be ! Oft meseemeth , in the days that yet shall be , When no slave of gold abideth ‘ twixt the breadth of sea to sea ,</p>
   <p>Oft , when men and maids are merry , ere the sunlight leaves the earth , And they bless the day beloved , all too short for all their mirth ,</p>
   <p>Some shall pause awhile and ponder on the bitter days of old , Ere the toil of strife and battle overthrew the curse of gold ;</p>
   <p>Then ‘ twixt lips of loved and lover solemn thoughts of us shall rise ; We who once were fools defeated , then shall be the brave and wise .</p>
   <p>There amidst the world new-builded shall our earthly deeds abide , Though our names be all forgotten , and the tale of how we died .</p>
   <p>Life or death then , who shall heed it , what we gain or what we lose ? Fair flies life amid the struggle , and the Cause for each shall choose .</p>
   <p>Hear a word , a word in season , for the day is drawing nigh , When the Cause shall call upon us , some to live , and some to die !</p>

   </lg>
   <p>No , no , it is she no longer ; never again can she come And behold the hay-wains creeping o'er the meadows of her home ; No more can she kiss her son or put the rake in his hand That she handled a while agone in the midst of the haymaking band . Her laughter is gone and her life ; there is no such thing on the earth , No share for me then in the stir , no share in the hurry and mirth . Nay , let me look and believe that all these will vanish away , At least when the night has fallen , and that she will be there ‘ mid the hay , Happy and weary with work , waiting and longing for love . There will she be , as of old , when the great moon hung above , And lightless and dead was the village , and nought but the weir was awake ; There will she rise to meet me , and my hands will she hasten to take , And thence shall we wander away , and over the ancient bridge By many a rose-hung hedgerow , till we reach the sun-burnt ridge And the great trench digged by the Romans : there then awhile shall we stand , To watch the dawn come creeping o'er the fragrant lovely land , Till all the world awaketh , and draws us down , we twain , To the deeds of the field and the fold and the merry summer 's gain .</p>

    <head>MINE AND THINE</head>

     <l n="1">Two words about the world we see ,</l>

     <l n="3">Ah ! might we drive them forth and wide</l>

     <l n="5">All free , nought owned of goods and gear ,</l>
     <l n="6">By men and women though it were .</l>
     <l n="7">Common to all all wheat and wine</l>

     <l n="10">When Mine and Thine are known no more .</l>
     <l n="11">Yea , God , well counselled for our health ,</l>
     <l n="12">Gave all this fleeting earthly wealth</l>
     <l n="13">A common heritage to all ,</l>
     <l n="14">That men might feed them therewithal ,</l>
     <l n="15">And clothe their limbs and shoe their feet</l>
     <l n="16">And live a simple life and sweet .</l>

     <l n="3">And the clouds lay alow on the earth and the sea ;</l>
     <l n="4">He looked not aloft as they hoisted the sail ,</l>
     <l n="5">But with hand on the tiller hallooed to the shipmen</l>
     <l n="6">In a voice grown so strange , that it scarce had seemed stranger</l>

     <l n="8">On the guard-chamber hangings , some early grey dawning</l>
     <l n="9">Great Jason had cried , and his golden locks wavered .</l>
     <l n="10">Then e'en as the oars ran outboard , and dashed</l>
     <l n="11">In the wind-scattered foam and the sails bellied out ,</l>
     <l n="12">His hand dropped from the tiller , and with feet all uncertain</l>
     <l n="13">And dull eye he wended him down to the midship ,</l>
     <l n="14">And gazing about for the place of the gangway</l>
     <l n="15">Made for the gate of the bulwark half open ,</l>
     <l n="16">And stood there and stared at the swallowing sea ,</l>

     <l n="18">And sat down on the deck by the side of the helmsman ,</l>

     <l n="2">There the ladies went lightly in glorious array ;</l>
     <l n="3">In the old arms we armed him whose dints well he knew</l>
     <l n="4">That the night dew had dulled and the sea salt had sullied :</l>
     <l n="5">On the old roan yet sturdy we set him astride ;</l>
     <l n="6">So he stretched forth his hand to lay hold of the spear</l>
     <l n="7">Neither laughing nor frowning , as lightly his wont was</l>
     <l n="8">When the knights are awaiting the voice of the trumpet .</l>
     <l n="9">It awoke , and back beaten from barrier to barrier</l>

     <l n="13">And the bones of the world are dashed grinding together .</l>
     <l n="14">So it seemed to my heart , and a horror came o'er me ,</l>
     <l n="15">As the spears met , and splinters flew high o'er the field ,</l>
     <l n="16">And I saw the king stay when his course was at swiftest ,</l>
     <l n="17">His horse straining hard on the bit , and he standing</l>
     <l n="18">Stiff and stark in his stirrups , his spear held by the midmost ,</l>

     <l n="20">E'en as one might , who , riding to heaven , feels round him</l>
     <l n="21">The devils unseen : then he raised up the spear</l>
     <l n="22">As to cast it away , but therewith failed his fury ,</l>
     <l n="23">He dropped it , and faintly sank back in the saddle ,</l>
     <l n="24">And , turning his horse from the press and the turmoil ,</l>
     <l n="25">Came sighing to me , and sore grieving I took him</l>
     <l n="26">And led him away , while the lists were fallen silent</l>
     <l n="27">As a fight in a dream that the light breaketh through .—</l>
     <l n="28">To the tune of the clinking of his fight-honoured armour</l>

     <l n="15">Kind and calm , yea and glad , yet with eyes of one seeking .</l>
     <l n="16">— Ah the mouth of one waiting , ere all shall be over !—</l>
     <l n="17">But at last in the winter-tide mid the dark forest</l>
     <l n="18">Side by side did we wend down the pass : the wind tangled</l>
     <l n="19">Mid the trunks and black boughs made wild music about us ,</l>
     <l n="20">But her feet on the scant snow and the sound of her breathing</l>
     <l n="21">Made music much better : the wood thinned , and I saw her ,</l>
     <l n="22">As we came to the brow of the pass ; for the moon gleamed</l>
     <l n="23">Bitter cold in the cloudless black sky of the winter .</l>
     <l n="24">Then the world drew me back from my love , and departing</l>
     <l n="25">I saw her sweet serious look pass into terror</l>
     <l n="26">And her arms cast abroad — and lo , clashing of armour ,</l>
     <l n="27">And a sword in my hand , and my mouth crying loud ,</l>
     <l n="28">And the moon and cold steel in the doorway burst open</l>
     <l n="29">And thy doughty spear thrust through the throat of the foeman</l>
     <l n="30">My dazed eyes scarce saw — thou rememberest , my fosterer ?</l>

     <l n="2">Day came thronging on day , month thrust month aside ,</l>
     <l n="3">Amid battle and strife and the murder of glory ,</l>
     <l n="4">And still oft and oft to that land was I led</l>
     <l n="5">And still through all longing I young in Love 's dealings ,</l>
     <l n="6">Never called it a pain : though , the battle passed over ,</l>
     <l n="7">The council determined , back again came my craving :</l>
     <l n="8">I knew not the pain , but I knew all the pleasure ,</l>
     <l n="9">When now , as the clouds o'er my fortune were parting ,</l>
     <l n="10">I felt myself waxing in might and in wisdom ;</l>
     <l n="11">And no city welcomed the Freed and the Freer ,</l>
     <l n="12">And no mighty army fell back before rumour</l>
     <l n="13">Of Pharamond 's coming , but her heart bid me thither ,</l>
     <l n="14">And the blithest and kindest of kingfolk ye knew me .</l>
     <l n="15">Then came the high tide of deliverance upon us ,</l>
     <l n="16">When surely if we in the red field had fallen</l>
     <l n="17">The stocks and the stones would have risen to avenge us .</l>
     <l n="18">— Then waned my sweet vision midst glory 's fulfilment ,</l>
     <l n="19">And still with its waning , hot waxed my desire :</l>
     <l n="20">And did ye not note then that the glad-hearted Pharamond</l>
     <l n="21">Was grown a stern man , a fierce king , it may be ?</l>

     <l n="23">Of battle and murder and treason about me ?</l>
     <l n="24">Nay , nay , it was love 's pain , first named and first noted</l>

     <l n="26">— Thou rememberest a year agone now , when the legate</l>
     <l n="27">Of the Lord of the Waters brought here a broad letter</l>
     <l n="28">Full of prayers for good peace and our friendship thenceforward —</l>
     <l n="29">— He who erst set a price on the lost head of Pharamond —</l>
     <l n="30">How I bade him stand up on his feet and be merry ,</l>
     <l n="31">Eat his meat by my side and drink out of my beaker ,</l>
     <l n="32">In memory of days when my meat was but little</l>
     <l n="33">And my drink drunk in haste between saddle and straw .</l>
     <l n="34">But lo ! midst of my triumph , as I noted the feigning</l>
     <l n="35">Of the last foeman humbled , and the hall fell a murmuring ,</l>
     <l n="36">And blithely the horns blew , Be glad , spring prevaileth ,</l>
     <l n="37">— As I sat there and changed not , my soul saw a vision :</l>
     <l n="38">All folk faded away , and my love that I long for</l>
     <l n="39">Came with raiment a-rustling along the hall pavement ,</l>
     <l n="40">Drawing near to the high-seat , with hands held out a little ,</l>
     <l n="41">Till her hallowed eyes drew me a space into heaven ,</l>
     <l n="42">And her lips moved to whisper , ‘ Come , love , for I weary ! ’</l>
     <l n="43">Then she turned and went from me , and I heard her feet falling</l>
     <l n="44">On the floor of the hall , e'en as though it were empty</l>
     <l n="45">Of all folk but us twain in the hush of the dawning .</l>
     <l n="46">Then again , all was gone , and I sat there a smiling</l>
     <l n="47">On the faint-smiling legate , as the hall windows quivered</l>
     <l n="48">With the rain of the early night sweeping across them .</l>
     <l n="49">Nought slept I that night , yet I saw her without sleeping :—</l>
     <l n="50">Betwixt midnight and morn of that summer-tide was I</l>
     <l n="51">Amidst of the lilies by her house-door to hearken</l>
     <l n="52">If perchance in her chamber she turned amid sleeping :</l>
     <l n="53">When lo , as the East ‘ gan to change , and stars faded</l>
     <l n="54">Were her feet on the stairs , and the door opened softly ,</l>
     <l n="55">And she stood on the threshold with the eyes of one seeking ,</l>
     <l n="56">And there , gathering the folds of her gown to her girdle ,</l>
     <l n="57">Went forth through the garden and followed the highway ,</l>
     <l n="58">All along the green valley , and I ever beside her ,</l>
     <l n="59">Till the light of the low sun just risen was falling</l>
     <l n="60">On her feet in the first of the pass — and all faded .</l>
     <l n="61">Yet from her unto me had gone forth her intent ,</l>
     <l n="62">And I saw her face set to the heart of that city ,</l>
     <l n="63">And the quays where the ships of the outlanders come to ,</l>
     <l n="64">And I said : She is seeking , and shall I not seek ?</l>
     <l n="65">The sea is her prison wall ; where is my prison ?</l>
     <l n="66">— Yet I said : Here men praise me , perchance men may love me</l>
     <l n="67">If I live long enough for my justice and mercy</l>
     <l n="68">To make them just and merciful — one who is master</l>
     <l n="69">Of many poor folk , a man pity moveth</l>
     <l n="70">Love hath dealt with in this wise , no minstrel nor dreamer .</l>
     <l n="71">The deeds that my hand might find for the doing</l>
     <l n="72">Did desire undo them these four years of fight ?</l>
     <l n="73">And now time and fair peace in my heart have begotten</l>
     <l n="74">More desire and more pain , is the day of deeds done with ?</l>
     <l n="75">Lo here for my part my bonds and my prison !—</l>
     <l n="76">Then with hands holding praise , yet with fierce heart belike</l>
     <l n="77">Did I turn to the people that I had delivered —</l>
     <l n="78">And the deeds of this year passed shall live peradventure !</l>
     <l n="79">But now came no solace of dreams in the night-tide</l>
     <l n="80">From that day thenceforward ; yet oft in the council ,</l>
     <l n="81">Mid the hearkening folk craving for justice or mercy ,</l>
     <l n="82">Mid the righting of wrongs and the staying of ruin ,</l>
     <l n="83">Mid the ruling a dull folk , who deemed all my kingship</l>
     <l n="84">A thing due and easy as the dawning and sunset</l>
     <l n="85">To the day that God made once to deal with no further —</l>
     <l n="86">— Mid all these a fair face , a sad face , could I fashion ,</l>
     <l n="87">And I said , She is seeking , and shall I not seek ?</l>
     <l n="88">— Tell over the days of the year of hope 's waning ;</l>
     <l n="89">Tell over the hours of the weary days wearing :</l>

     <l n="2">Down to the ship , and the merchant-folks ’ babble .</l>
     <l n="3">The oily green waves in the harbour mouth glistened ,</l>
     <l n="4">Windless midnight it was , but the great sweeps were run out ,</l>
     <l n="5">As the cable came rattling mid rich bales on the deck ,</l>
     <l n="6">And slow moved the black side that the ripple was lapping ,</l>
     <l n="7">And I looked and beheld a great city behind us</l>
     <l n="8">By the last of the moon as the stars were a-brightening ,</l>
     <l n="9">And Pharamond the Freed grew a tale of a singer ,</l>
     <l n="10">With the land of his fathers and the fame he had toiled for .</l>

     <l n="14">On the poop or the prow , ‘ gan to move and begone ,</l>
     <l n="15">Till at last ‘ neath the far-gazing eyes of the steersman</l>
     <l n="16">By the loitering watch thou and I were left lonely ,</l>
     <l n="17">And we saw by the moon the white horses arising</l>
     <l n="18">Where beyond the last headland the ocean abode us ,</l>

     <l n="21">As we shifted our course toward the west in the dawning ;</l>
     <l n="22">Then I slept and I dreamed in the dark I was lying ,</l>
     <l n="23">And I heard her sweet breath and her feet falling near me ,</l>

     <l n="4">That tale of the King and his fate , o'er the cradle</l>
     <l n="5">Foretold by the wise of the world ; that a woman</l>
     <l n="6">Should win him to love and to woe , and despairing</l>

     <l n="1">They shut the young king in a castle , the tale saith ,</l>
     <l n="2">Where never came woman , and never should come ,</l>
     <l n="3">And sadly he grew up and stored with all wisdom ,</l>
     <l n="4">Not wishing for aught in his heart that he had not ,</l>
     <l n="5">Till the time was come round to his twentieth birthday .</l>

     <l n="9">Whose Queen would have kept thee her slave and her lover ,</l>
     <l n="10">And how we escaped by the fair woman 's kindness ,</l>
     <l n="11">Who loved thee , and cast her life by for thy welfare ?</l>
     <l n="12">Of the waste of thy life when we sailed from the Southlands ,</l>
     <l n="13">And the sea-thieves fell on us and sold us for servants</l>

     <l n="20">And hast thou forgotten how again we fled from it ,</l>
     <l n="21">And that fight of despair in the boat on the river ,</l>
     <l n="22">And the sea-strand again and white bellying sails ;</l>
     <l n="23">And the sore drought and famine that on ship-board fell on us ,</l>
     <l n="24">Ere the sea was o'erpast , and we came scarcely living</l>
     <l n="25">To those keepers of sheep , the poor folk and the kind ?</l>
     <l n="26">Dost thou mind not the merchants who brought us thence northward ,</l>
     <l n="27">And this land that we made in the twilight of dawning ?</l>
     <l n="28">And the city herein where all kindness forsook us ,</l>
