     <l n="1">My songs were once of the sunrise :</l>
     <l n="2">They shouted it over the bar ;</l>
     <l n="3">First-footing the dawns , they flourished ,</l>
     <l n="4">And flamed with the morning star .</l>

     <l n="5">My songs are now of the sunset :</l>
     <l n="6">Their brows are touched with light ,</l>

     <l n="8">And wet with the dews of night .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="2">In sumptuous chords , and strange ,</l>
     <l n="3">Through rich yet poignant harmonies :</l>
     <l n="4">Subtle and strong browns , reds</l>
     <l n="5">Magnificent with death and the pride of death ,</l>
     <l n="6">Thin , clamant greens</l>
     <l n="7">And delicate yellows that exhaust</l>
     <l n="8">The exquisite chromatics of decay :</l>
     <l n="9">From ruining gardens , from reluctant woods —</l>
     <l n="10">Dear , multitudinously reluctant woods !—</l>
     <l n="11">And sering margents , forced</l>
     <l n="12">To be lean and bare and perished grace by grace ,</l>
     <l n="13">And flower by flower discharmed ,</l>

     <l n="16">The dead-march of the year .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="17">Dead things and dying ! Now the long-laboured soul</l>
     <l n="18">Listens , and pines . But never a note of hope</l>
     <l n="19">Sounds : whether in those high ,</l>
     <l n="20">Transcending unisons of resignation</l>
     <l n="21">That speed the sovran sun ,</l>
     <l n="22">As he goes southing , weakening , minishing ,</l>
     <l n="23">Almighty in obedience ; or in those</l>
     <l n="24">Small , sorrowful colloquies</l>
     <l n="25">Of bronze and russet and gold ,</l>
     <l n="26">Colour with colour , dying things with dead ,</l>
     <l n="27">That break along this visual orchestra :</l>
     <l n="28">As in that other one , the audible ,</l>
     <l n="29">Horn answers horn , hautboy and violin</l>
     <l n="30">Talk , and the ‘ cello calls the clarionet</l>
     <l n="31">And flute , and the poor heart is glad .</l>

     <l n="33">Then , destiny in act , ensues</l>
     <l n="34">That most tremendous passage in the score :</l>
     <l n="35">When hangman rains and winds have wrought</l>
     <l n="36">Their worst , and , the brave lights gone down ,</l>
     <l n="37">The low strings , the brute brass , the sullen drums</l>
     <l n="38">Sob , grovel , and curse themselves</l>
     <l n="39">Silent . . . .</l>
     <l n="40">But on the spirit of Man</l>
     <l n="41">And on the heart of the World there falls</l>
     <l n="42">A strange , half-desperate peace :</l>
     <l n="43">A war-worn , militant , gray jubilance</l>
     <l n="44">In the unkind , implacable tyranny</l>
     <l n="45">Of Winter , the obscene ,</l>
     <l n="46">Old , crapulous Regent , who in his loins —</l>
     <l n="47">O , who but feels he carries in his loins</l>

      <l n="6">Whose style still breathed a faint and fine perfume</l>
      <l n="7">Of old-world courtliness and old-world bloom :</l>
      <l n="8">When speech was elegant and talk was fit ,</l>
      <l n="9">For slang had not been canonised as wit ;</l>
      <l n="10">When manners reigned , when breeding had the wall ,</l>

      <l n="12">When Grace was conscious of its gracefulness ,</l>
      <l n="13">And man — though Man !— was not ashamed to dress .</l>
      <l n="14">A brave formality , a measured ease</l>

      <l n="27">They could — and did — get wounded unto death .</l>
      <l n="28">As at all times since time for us began</l>
      <l n="29">Woman was truly woman , man was man ,</l>
