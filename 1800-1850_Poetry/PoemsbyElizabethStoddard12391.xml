    <head>THE POET 'S SECRET .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">The poet 's secret I must know ,</l>
     <l n="2">If that will calm my restless mind .</l>
     <l n="3">I hail the seasons as they go ,</l>
     <l n="4">I woo the sunshine , brave the wind .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">I scan the lily and the rose ,</l>
     <l n="6">I nod to every nodding tree ,</l>
     <l n="7">I follow every stream that flows ,</l>
     <l n="8">And wait beside the steadfast sea .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">I question melancholy eyes ,</l>
     <l n="10">I touch the lips of women fair :</l>
     <l n="11">Their lips and eyes may make me wise ,</l>
     <l n="12">But what I seek for is not there .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">In vain I watch the day and night ,</l>
     <l n="14">In vain the world through space may roll :</l>
     <l n="15">I never see the mystic light</l>
     <l n="16">Which fills the poet 's happy soul .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="17">Through life I hear the rhythmic flow</l>
     <l n="18">Whose meaning into song must turn ;</l>
     <l n="19">Revealing all he longs to know ,</l>
     <l n="20">The secret each alone must learn .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>NOVEMBER .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Much have I spoken of the faded leaf ;</l>
     <l n="2">Long have I listened to the wailing wind ,</l>
     <l n="3">And watched it ploughing through the heavy clouds ,</l>
     <l n="4">For autumn charms my melancholy mind .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">When autumn comes , the poets sing a dirge :</l>
     <l n="6">The year must perish ; all the flowers are dead ;</l>
     <l n="7">The sheaves are gathered ; and the mottled quail</l>
     <l n="8">Runs in the stubble , but the lark has fled !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">Still , autumn ushers in the Christmas cheer ,</l>
     <l n="10">The holly-berries and the ivy-tree :</l>
     <l n="11">They weave a chaplet for the Old Year 's bier</l>
     <l n="12">These waiting mourners do not sing for me !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">I find sweet peace in depths of autumn woods .</l>
     <l n="14">Where grow the ragged ferns and roughened moss ;</l>
     <l n="15">The naked , silent trees have taught me this ,—</l>
     <l n="16">The loss of beauty is not always loss !</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>MUSIC IN A CROWD .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">When I hear music , whether waltz or psalm ,</l>
     <l n="2">Among a crowd , I find myself alone ;</l>
     <l n="3">It does not touch me with a soothing balm ,</l>
     <l n="4">But brings an echo like a moan</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">From some far country where a palace rose ,</l>
     <l n="6">In which I reigned with Cleopatra 's pride :</l>
     <l n="7">“ Come , Charmian ! bring the asp for my repose . ”</l>
     <l n="8">And queenly , men shall say , she died .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">There lived and ruled a happy , noble race ,</l>
     <l n="10">Primeval souls who held imperial power —</l>
     <l n="11">My kindred , gone forever from their place ,</l>
     <l n="12">And I am here without a dower !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">They were a Vision , though . And are these real ,</l>
     <l n="14">These men and women , moving as in sleep ,</l>
     <l n="15">Who , smiling , gesture to the same Ideal ,</l>
     <l n="16">For which the music makes me weep ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="17">Have they my longings for that other world</l>
     <l n="18">New to them yet ? I grant that Music 's swell</l>
     <l n="19">Is like the sea ; they may be thither hurled</l>
     <l n="20">By storms that thunder and compel ;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="21">Or , like those voyagers in the land of streams ,</l>
     <l n="22">Glide through its languid air , its languid wave ,</l>
     <l n="23">To learn that Here and There are but two dreams ,</l>
     <l n="24">That end in Nothing and the Grave !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="25">“ I LIVE WITHIN THE STRANGER 'S GATE . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="part" n="1">
     <head>I .</head>
     <lg type="stanza" n="8">
      <l n="26">I live within the stranger 's gate ,</l>
      <l n="27">And count the hours</l>
      <l n="28">Since God let fall the bolt of fate !</l>
      <l n="29">Where the waves fall on yonder shore</l>
      <l n="30">In cloudy spray ,</l>
      <l n="31">And where the winds forever roar ,</l>
      <l n="32">The pillars of a mansion stand ,</l>
      <l n="33">Without a roof ;</l>
      <l n="34">The saddest ruin in the land !</l>
     </lg>
    </lg>
    <lg type="part" n="2">
     <head>II .</head>
     <lg type="stanza" n="9">
      <l n="35">When sunset strikes across the sea</l>
      <l n="36">The wreck looms up ;</l>
      <l n="37">Then Memory comes , and touches me .</l>
      <l n="38">I see a pitiful white face</l>
      <l n="39">Break through the mould</l>
      <l n="40">Decaying at the pillar 's base ,</l>
      <l n="41">And hands that beckon me to prayer .</l>
      <l n="42">But I still curse ,</l>
      <l n="43">And wake the Furies slumbering there !</l>
     </lg>

      <l n="44">In the strange drama of the Past</l>
      <l n="45">It was my part</l>
      <l n="46">To hold carousal to the last ;</l>
      <l n="47">It was for me to hide the shame ,</l>
      <l n="48">And brave the world</l>
      <l n="49">With lies about our ancient name !</l>
      <l n="50">I played it well , and played it long :</l>
      <l n="51">But let it pass ,</l>
      <l n="52">The world has never known the ‘ wrong .</l>

    <head>THE HOUSE OF YOUTH .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">The rough north winds have left their icy caves</l>
     <l n="2">To growl and grope for prey</l>
     <l n="3">Upon the murky sea ;</l>
     <l n="4">The lonely sea-gull skims the sullen waves</l>
     <l n="5">All the gray winter day .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="6">The mottled sand-bird runneth up and down ,</l>
     <l n="7">Amongst the creaking sedge ,</l>
     <l n="8">Along the crusted beach ;</l>
     <l n="9">The time-stained houses of the sea-walled town</l>
     <l n="10">Seem tottering on its edge .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="11">An ancient dwelling , in this ancient place ,</l>
     <l n="12">Stands in a garden drear ,</l>
     <l n="13">A wreck with other wrecks ;</l>
     <l n="14">The Past is there , but no one sees a face</l>
     <l n="15">Within , from year to year .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="16">The wiry rose-trees scratch the window-pane ;</l>
     <l n="17">The window rattles loud ;</l>
     <l n="18">The wind beats at the door ,</l>
     <l n="19">But never gets an answer back again ,</l>
     <l n="20">The silence is so proud .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="21">The last that lived there was an evil man ;</l>
     <l n="22">A child the last that died ,</l>
     <l n="23">Upon the mother 's breast .</l>
     <l n="24">It seemed to die by some mysterious ban ;</l>
     <l n="25">Its grave is by the side</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="26">Of an old tree , whose notched and scanty leaves</l>
     <l n="27">Repeat the tale of woe ,</l>
     <l n="28">And quiver day and night ,</l>
     <l n="29">Till the snow cometh , and a cold shroud weaves ,</l>
     <l n="30">Whiter than that below .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="31">This time of year a woman wanders there —</l>
     <l n="32">They say from distant lands :</l>

     <l n="41">The shadow strikes against the window-pane ;</l>

     <l n="46">The moon shines down the dismal garden track ,</l>

    <head>THE RACE .</head>
     <l n="1">The guests were gathered in the ancient park</l>
     <l n="2">Of my Lord Wynne , and he was now their mark</l>
     <l n="3">For wit and gossip — quite the usual way ,</l>
     <l n="4">Where one bestows , and no one need repay .</l>
     <l n="5">“ A stumbling-block his pride ; his heart 's in strife</l>
     <l n="6">Between two women , which to choose for wife .</l>
     <l n="7">He 's always hovering round that lovely girl ,</l>
     <l n="8">His lawyer 's daughter , who will never furl</l>
     <l n="9">Her flag of pride : she rivals Gilbert there .</l>
     <l n="10">Now watch their meeting ; none more bravely wear</l>
     <l n="11">Their beauty , recognize a woman 's own ,</l>
     <l n="12">Than Clara Mercome . Gilbert Wynne has sown</l>
     <l n="13">His wild oats for her sake ; yet he delays ,</l>
     <l n="14">And with my Lady Bond divides his days .</l>
     <l n="15">Who bets on beauty , hedges in on age ;</l>
     <l n="16">Which tries the flight to perch in Lord Wynne 's cage ?</l>
     <l n="17">Will Lady Bond or Clara be the queen ?</l>
     <l n="18">For Lady Bond is certain of her lien . ”</l>
     <l n="19">He heard this talk while standing by a beech —</l>
     <l n="20">Hugh Wynne — and planned how he might overreach</l>
     <l n="21">Gilbert and Clara , break the pride of both ,</l>
     <l n="22">Part them for good , or make them plight their troth .</l>
     <l n="23">“ Now for a race , ” he cried , “ to Martin 's Mill ;</l>
     <l n="24">The boats are here ; behold , the lake is still .</l>
     <l n="25">Here , Gilbert , take your oar ; I 'll follow soon ,</l>
     <l n="26">Though sunset 's nigh — to-night is harvest-moon .</l>
     <l n="27">Let go the rope , the knot 's inside ; take these ,</l>
     <l n="28">Arrange a seat , adjust it at your ease .</l>
     <l n="29">She 's here . Miss Mercome , you will help him win</l>
     <l n="30">The race , and will not count my wager sin . ”</l>
     <l n="31">And he was gone ; the pair were face to face .</l>
     <l n="32">“ I 'll take the oars , ” he gasped ; “ we 'll win this race . ”</l>
     <l n="33">He never felt his heart so in his breast .</l>
     <l n="34">“ I hope you will forgive my cousin 's jest ? ”</l>
     <l n="35">A haughty murmur was her sole reply .</l>
     <l n="36">No rowers followed . Never did swallows fly</l>
     <l n="37">So swift , or dip the lake like Gilbert 's oars .</l>
     <l n="38">He was watchful , careless she . “ There soars</l>
     <l n="39">A heron , quite a feature of your state :</l>
     <l n="40">Are gems and peacocks , tell me , still in date ?</l>
     <l n="41">How deep the woods upon the water steal ,</l>
     <l n="42">One to the other making soft appeal ! ”</l>
     <l n="43">“ Not being human , wood and water meet</l>
     <l n="44">In their own speech , and soulless things are sweet</l>
     <l n="45">Together . So they are to me . I like</l>
     <l n="46">To watch the herons by the sedgy dike ;</l>
     <l n="47">They keep me tranquil ; and I love to feed</l>
     <l n="48">The pike in yon old pool ; they help to lead —</l>
     <l n="49">Why , here is Martin 's Bridge , and yet no boats !</l>
     <l n="50">Shall we return ? ” Said Clara then , “ There floats</l>
     <l n="51">A lily bed beyond ; let 's shoot beneath</l>
     <l n="52">The bridge , and lilies pull ; I want a wreath . ”</l>
     <l n="53">He knew the channel narrow ; it was dark ;</l>
     <l n="54">But his heart leaped at this relenting mark .</l>
     <l n="55">He drew his oars up , pointed in the helm ,</l>
     <l n="56">And shot in the cool gloom . He thought no realm</l>
     <l n="57">On which the sun had shone was half so bright .</l>
     <l n="58">And somehow Clara thought it nice as light .</l>
     <l n="59">The waters swirled so swift that in the noise</l>
     <l n="60">Clara grew dizzy ; Gilbert lost his poise ,</l>
     <l n="61">And lost an oar ; with a confusing shock</l>
     <l n="62">The boat was grinding — stopped against a rock .</l>
     <l n="63">“ Gilbert , my dear , are we not going down ? ”</l>
     <l n="64">“ Dearest , my love , we were not born to drown .</l>
     <l n="65">Oh , kiss me ; we are safe ; and grant me now</l>
     <l n="66">Yourself . I 'll gather lilies for your brow ;</l>
     <l n="67">And Hugh will know that I have won the race ,</l>
     <l n="68">And Clara , my dear wife , her rightful place . ”</l>

     <l n="9">And all the boughs are peopled quick by spring</l>
     <l n="10">Above the furrows of forgotten graves .</l>
     <l n="11">The one we thought had made the nation 's creed ,</l>
     <l n="12">Whose death would rive us like a thunderbolt ,</l>
     <l n="13">Dropped down — a sudden rustling in the leaves ,</l>
     <l n="14">A knowledge of the gap , and that was all !</l>
     <l n="15">The robin flitting on his frozen mound</l>
     <l n="16">Is more than he . Whoever dies , gives up</l>
     <l n="17">Unfinished work , which others , tempted , claim</l>
     <l n="18">And carry on . I would go free , and change</l>
     <l n="19">Into a star above the multitude ,</l>
     <l n="20">To shine afar , and penetrate where those</l>
     <l n="21">Who in the darkling boughs are prisoned close ,</l>
     <l n="22">But when they catch my rays , will borrow light ,</l>
     <l n="23">Believing it their own , and it will serve .</l>

    <head>TO AN ARTIST .</head>
     <l n="1">To me , long absent from the world of art ,</l>
     <l n="2">You bring the clouded mountains , my desire ,</l>
     <l n="3">The tranquil river , and the stormy sea ,</l>
     <l n="4">The far , pale morning , and the crimson eve ,</l>
     <l n="5">And silent days , that brood among lush leaves ,</l>
     <l n="6">When , in the afternoon , the summer sun</l>
     <l n="7">Is gliding down the hazy yellow west ,</l>
     <l n="8">And my soul 's atmosphere rests in the scene ,</l>
     <l n="9">Until I dream the boundaries of my life</l>
     <l n="10">May hold an unknown , coming happiness .</l>
     <l n="11">How shall I , then , to show my gratitude ,</l>
     <l n="12">But offer you a picture drawn in words —</l>
     <l n="13">With all the art I have ,— in black and white !</l>

    <head>A LANDSCAPE .</head>
     <l n="1">Between me and the woods along the bay</l>
     <l n="2">The swallows circle through the darkling mist ,</l>
     <l n="3">The robins breast the grass , and they divide</l>
     <l n="4">This solitude with me . The rippling sea</l>
     <l n="5">And sunset clouds , the sea gulls ’ flashing flight</l>
     <l n="6">From looming isles beyond — I watch them now</l>
     <l n="7">With a new sense . Where are the swallows ’ young ,</l>
     <l n="8">And where the robins ’ nests ? Year after year</l>
     <l n="9">They hover round this ancient house , and I ,</l>
     <l n="10">Within as heedless , saw the long years pass ,</l>
     <l n="11">Nor ever dreamed a day like this might come —</l>
     <l n="12">A day when mourners go about the street</l>
     <l n="13">For one who always loved his fellow-men .</l>
     <l n="14">The windflower trembles in the woods , the sod</l>
     <l n="15">Is full of violets , the orchards rain</l>
     <l n="16">Their scented blossoms . May unfolds its leaves —</l>
     <l n="17">Nature 's eternal mystery to renew .</l>
     <l n="18">Must man be less than leaf or flower , and end ?</l>
     <l n="19">If I go hence , when this departed soul</l>
     <l n="20">Has left no human tie to bind me now ,</l>
     <l n="21">When spring unfolds , and I recall his past ,</l>
     <l n="22">Will their remembrance lead me here again ,</l>
     <l n="23">To teach me that his spirit comes to show</l>
     <l n="24">That Nature is eternal for man 's sake ?</l>

    <head>FROM THE HEADLAND .</head>
     <l n="1">I hear the waters of some inlet now</l>
     <l n="2">Come lapping to the fringe of yonder wood ,</l>
     <l n="3">The storm-bent firs , and oaks along the cliff .</l>
     <l n="4">The yellow leaves are glistening in the grass ,</l>
     <l n="5">The grassy slope I climb this autumn day .</l>
     <l n="6">Ensnaring me , the brambles clutch my feet ,</l>
     <l n="7">As if constraining me to be a guest</l>
     <l n="8">To the wild , silent populace they shield .</l>
     <l n="9">It cannot say , nor I , why we are here .</l>
     <l n="10">What is my recompense upon this soil ,</l>
     <l n="11">For other paths are mine if I go hence ,</l>
     <l n="12">Still must I make the mystery my quest ?</l>
     <l n="13">For here or there , I think , one sways my will .</l>
     <l n="14">There is no show of beauty to delight</l>
     <l n="15">The vision here , or strike the electric chord</l>
     <l n="16">Which makes the present and the past as one .</l>
     <l n="17">No thickets where the thrushes sing in maze</l>
     <l n="18">Of green , no silver-threaded waterfalls</l>
     <l n="19">In vales , where summer sleeps in darkling woods</l>
     <l n="20">With sunlit glades , and pools where lilies blow .</l>
     <l n="21">Here , but the wiry grass and sorrel beds ,</l>
     <l n="22">The gaping edges of the sand ravines ,</l>
     <l n="23">Whose shifting sides are tufted with dull herbs ,</l>
     <l n="24">Drooping above a brook , that sluggish creeps</l>
     <l n="25">Down to the whispering rushes in the marsh .</l>
     <l n="26">And this is all , until I reach the cliff ,</l>
     <l n="27">And on the headland 's verge I stand , enthralled</l>
     <l n="28">Before the gulf of the unquenchable sea —</l>
     <l n="29">The sea , inexorable in its might ,</l>
     <l n="30">Circling the pebbly beach with limpid tides ,</l>
     <l n="31">Storming in bays whose margins fade in mist ;</l>
     <l n="32">Now blue and silent as a noonday sky ,</l>
     <l n="33">At twilight now the pearly rollers shake</l>
     <l n="34">The sunset 's trail of violet and gold ;</l>
     <l n="35">Or black , when rushing on the rocky isles</l>
     <l n="36">Anchored in waves that bellow to the winds .</l>
     <l n="37">I watch till comes the night ; the moonlight falls ,</l>
     <l n="38">The silvery deep on some far journey goes ,</l>
     <l n="39">To solve for me , I think , this mystery .</l>

    <head>THE VISITINGS OF TRUTH KNOWN ELSEWHERE .</head>
     <l n="1">Spending abroad these varied autumn days ,</l>
     <l n="2">Their melancholy legend I deny .</l>
     <l n="3">They keep a vanished treasure I will seek ,</l>
     <l n="4">And follow on a track of mystic hopes .</l>
     <l n="5">While watching in thy atmosphere , I see</l>
     <l n="6">The form of beauty changes , not its soul .</l>
     <l n="7">When with the Spring , the flying feet of youth</l>
     <l n="8">Spurning the present as it passed , and me ,</l>
     <l n="9">I thought the world a mere environment</l>
     <l n="10">To hold my wishes and my happiness .</l>
     <l n="11">I have forgot that foolish , vain belief ,</l>
     <l n="12">Now in my sere and yellow leaf , serene ,</l>
     <l n="13">I offer Autumn all my homage now .</l>
     <l n="14">The eddies , whirling , rustling in my path ,</l>
     <l n="15">Lure me like sprites , and from the leaves a voice :</l>
     <l n="16">“ Say not our lesson is decay ; we fall ,</l>
     <l n="17">And lo , the naked trees in beauty lift</l>
     <l n="18">Their delicate tracery against the sky .</l>
     <l n="19">On the pale verdure of the grass we spread</l>
     <l n="20">A shining web of scarlet , bronze , and gold ;</l>
     <l n="21">When the rain comes , the oaks uphold us still .</l>

     <l n="23">Beneath the branches of the evergreens . ”</l>
     <l n="24">November 's clouds without a shadow lift</l>
     <l n="25">The purple mountains of its airy sphere ,</l>

     <l n="35">And round the quiet earth the stars wheel up ,</l>

    <head>WE MUST WAIT .</head>
     <l n="1">The testimony of my loss and gain</l>
     <l n="2">Will I give utterance to , though none may hear .</l>
     <l n="3">When long ago , bereft of all I loved ,</l>
     <l n="4">I sought in Nature recompense , implored</l>
     <l n="5">For pity , solace , or forgetfulness ,</l>
     <l n="6">“ The dear , familiar seasons as they pass ,</l>
     <l n="7">The seal of memory on every place , ”</l>
     <l n="8">I said , “ will give the sympathy I seek ,</l>
     <l n="9">The restoration which they owe to me . ”</l>
     <l n="10">By day and night I prayed as futile prayers</l>
     <l n="11">As the wind 's shriek in lonesome winter nights ;</l>
     <l n="12">By the sea they fell as empty as the shells</l>
     <l n="13">Upon its sands , uncertain as its mists .</l>
     <l n="14">With them I tracked the shadows of the woods ,</l>
     <l n="15">And sowed them in the fields among the seed ;</l>
     <l n="16">Whoso reaped harvest , I could gather none .</l>
     <l n="17">I wandered in the thickets , giving tongue</l>
     <l n="18">Like a lost hound , dazed by their solitude ,</l>
     <l n="19">The while birds called their mates , the lilies blazed ,</l>
     <l n="20">And roses opened to the wandering airs .</l>
     <l n="21">They vanished with the leaves that voyaged the brook ,</l>
     <l n="22">Which babbled of no story but its own .</l>
     <l n="23">How blind I was to Nature 's liberty !</l>
     <l n="24">Grief stalked beside me , I was sore beset ,</l>
     <l n="25">And could not hear the turning of Time 's wheel .</l>
     <l n="26">Still were the skies serene , the earth most fair ,</l>
     <l n="27">When with the doleful chant of dust to dust</l>
     <l n="28">Mingled the laughter of this sunlit sea ;</l>
     <l n="29">And through my tears I saw the ripples dance ,</l>
     <l n="30">And June 's sweet breezes kiss the swaying elms .</l>
     <l n="31">As he who turns the key within his door</l>
     <l n="32">And gazes at his walls before he goes ,</l>
     <l n="33">Then forward sets his steps — so I set mine</l>
     <l n="34">To join a band whose purpose was to find</l>
     <l n="35">A world of action ; but my heart was cold ,</l>
     <l n="36">My mind supine . Yet I remained with them ,</l>
     <l n="37">And answered to the roll called Honor , Fame !</l>
     <l n="38">Where were my memories and my ardent prayers ?</l>
     <l n="39">The years stood far behind , their columns graved</l>
     <l n="40">Deep with the adage which youth names No More .</l>
     <l n="41">Like one who enters some old storied hall ,</l>
     <l n="42">And down its vista suddenly beholds</l>
     <l n="43">A banner waving out its old device</l>
     <l n="44">Of victory — so suddenly I felt</l>
     <l n="45">My later life a void . I was recalled !</l>
     <l n="46">My prayers were answered , and behold me here ;</l>
     <l n="47">Within the pale of all my loss and gain ,</l>
     <l n="48">The dear , familiar seasons as they pass ,</l>
     <l n="49">The seal of memory on every place ,</l>
     <l n="50">Bestow the restoration which I sought .</l>
     <l n="51">At peace , I know , as those who suffer know ,</l>
     <l n="52">There is no secret we can wrest at will</l>
     <l n="53">From Nature . Time must bring and share with her</l>
     <l n="54">The gift of resignation , cure for grief ,</l>
     <l n="55">And cast upon our ways this ray of hope —</l>
     <l n="56">That I , the lost , and Nature may be one .</l>

     <l n="21">At least a vision of the vanished child ,</l>
     <l n="22">And let his heart commune with mine again ,</l>
     <l n="23">Though in a dream — his life was but a dream ;</l>
     <l n="24">Then might I wait with patient cheerfulness ,</l>
     <l n="25">That cheerfulness which keeps one 's tears unshed ,</l>
     <l n="26">And blinds the eyes with pain — the passage slow</l>
     <l n="27">Of other seasons , and be still and cold</l>
     <l n="28">As the earth is when shrouded in the snow ,</l>
     <l n="29">Or passive , like it , when the boughs are stripped</l>
     <l n="30">In autumn , and the leaves roll everywhere .</l>
     <l n="31">And he should go again ; for winter 's snows ,</l>
     <l n="32">And autumn 's melancholy voice , in winds ,</l>
     <l n="33">In waters , and in woods , belong to me ,</l>
     <l n="34">To me — a faded soul ; for , as I said ,</l>
     <l n="35">The sense of all his beauty , sweetness , comes</l>
     <l n="36">When blossoms are the sweetest ; when the sea ,</l>
     <l n="37">Sparkling and blue , cries to the sun in joy ,</l>
     <l n="38">Or , silent , pale , and misty waits the night ,</l>
     <l n="39">Till the moon , pushing through the veiling cloud ,</l>
     <l n="40">Hangs naked in its heaving solitude :</l>
     <l n="41">When feathery pines wave up and down the shore ,</l>
     <l n="42">And the vast deep above holds gentle stars ,</l>
     <l n="43">And the vast world beneath hides him from me !</l>

     <l n="20">Wonderful once , when I was like the flowers ;</l>
     <l n="21">Along the weedy paths grew roses still ,</l>

     <l n="26">From which , his feet made level with his head ,</l>
     <l n="27">Its occupant was gone . I lived alone .</l>
     <l n="28">Whoso , beneath this roof , had played his part</l>
     <l n="29">In life 's deep tragedy , not here again</l>
     <l n="30">Could be rehearsed its scenes of love or hate .</l>
     <l n="31">Upon the ancient walls my pictures hung ,</l>
     <l n="32">Of men and women , strong and beautiful ,</l>
     <l n="33">Whose shoulders pushed along the world 's great wheel ;</l>
     <l n="34">Landscapes , where cloud and mountain rose as one ,</l>
     <l n="35">Where rivers crept in secret vales , or rolled</l>
     <l n="36">Past city walls , whose towers and palaces</l>
     <l n="37">By slaves were builded , and by princes fallen !</l>
     <l n="38">And books whose pages ever told one tale ,</l>
     <l n="39">The tale of human love , in joy or pain ,</l>
     <l n="40">The seed of our last hope — Eternity .</l>
     <l n="41">Days glided by , this mirage cheating all ;</l>

     <l n="49">One moonlight night I walked through long white lanes ;</l>
     <l n="50">The sky and sea were like a frosted web ;</l>
     <l n="51">The air was heavy with familiar scents ,</l>
     <l n="52">Which travelled down the wind , I knew from where —</l>
     <l n="53">The fragrance of a grove of Northern pines .</l>

     <l n="57">Long years ago — fled from my father 's house ;</l>
     <l n="58">Banished myself , to banish him I loved —</l>
     <l n="59">His broken history and his early grave .</l>
     <l n="60">And in the moonlight Memory floated on ,</l>
     <l n="61">Immortal , with my now immortal Love !</l>

    <head>THE TRYST .</head>
     <l n="1">Impelled by memory in a wayward mood ,</l>
     <l n="2">Reluctant , yearning , with a faithless mind ,</l>
     <l n="3">I sought once more a long neglected spot ,</l>
     <l n="4">A wooded upland bordered by the sea ,</l>
     <l n="5">Whose tides were swirling up the reedy sands ,</l>
     <l n="6">Or floating noiseless in the yellow marsh .</l>
     <l n="7">My way was wild . The winds , awaking , smote</l>
     <l n="8">My face , but as I passed a ruined wall</l>
     <l n="9">Brambles and vines and waving blossoms dashed</l>
     <l n="10">A frolic-welcome , like a summer rain .</l>
     <l n="11">Shouldering the hills against the murky east</l>
     <l n="12">Stood stalwart oaks , and in the mossy sod</l>
     <l n="13">Below the trembling birches whispered me ,</l>
     <l n="14">“ Not here ! ” I reached the silence-loving pines ,</l>
     <l n="15">And lingered . The mists swept from the wooded hills ,</l>
     <l n="16">And , rolling seaward , hid the anchored ships .</l>
     <l n="17">So , happy , dreaming an old dream again ,</l>
     <l n="18">Of keeping tryst in secret on the knoll ,</l>
     <l n="19">I wandered on , listening in dreamy maze</l>
     <l n="20">To sounds I thought familiar ,— the approach</l>
     <l n="21">Of well-known footsteps in the leafy path ,—</l>
     <l n="22">A murmuring voice calling me by name !</l>
     <l n="23">Through the pine shafts the sunless light of dawn</l>
     <l n="24">Stole . Day was come . My dream would be fulfilled !</l>
     <l n="25">Above the hills the sky began to blaze ,</l>
     <l n="26">And ushering morn the west flushed rosy-red ;</l>
     <l n="27">Then , the Sun leaping from his bed of gold ,</l>
     <l n="28">Scattered cloud-banners , crimson , gray , and white .</l>
     <l n="29">There was my shadow in the leafy path</l>
     <l n="30">Alone ,— none was to keep the tryst with me !</l>
     <l n="31">No voice , no step among the hills I heard .</l>
     <l n="32">The joyous swallows from their nestlings flew ,</l>
     <l n="33">Mad in the light with song . Far out at sea</l>
     <l n="34">The white sails fluttered in the eager breeze ,</l>
     <l n="35">But Day was silent holding tryst with me ,—</l>
     <l n="36">My pilgrimage rewarded — faith restored .</l>

     <l n="3">Not by the margent of the sea ,</l>

     <l n="6">Between me and the world of men .</l>
     <l n="7">Beside me dips a wide ravine ,</l>
     <l n="8">Covered with a flowery screen ;</l>
     <l n="9">Far round me rise a band of hills ,</l>
     <l n="10">Whose voices reach me by their rills ,</l>
     <l n="11">Or deep susurrus of the wood ,</l>
     <l n="12">That stands in stately brotherhood ,</l>
     <l n="13">Upholding one vast web of green ,</l>
     <l n="14">Whereunder foot has never been —</l>

     <l n="30">Till it blaze up a golden crest .</l>
     <l n="31">The young moon bends her crescent horn</l>
     <l n="32">Against the lingering summer morn ;</l>
     <l n="33">Then , riding down the starry sky ,</l>
     <l n="34">She follows me till night goes by .</l>

     <l n="42">I give my pity to my kind .</l>
     <l n="43">For me this noble solitude !</l>

     <l n="48">Not like the poets — russet clad —</l>
     <l n="49">But scarlet , umber , green , and gold ;</l>
     <l n="50">Then in a breath I must behold</l>
     <l n="51">The autumn winds tear down my screen ,</l>
     <l n="52">And leave me not a leaf to glean .</l>
     <l n="53">The snow will cover glen and height ,</l>
     <l n="54">And all my hilltop glisten white ;</l>
     <l n="55">I see the crystal atoms fly</l>
     <l n="56">Under the dome of this gray sky .</l>
     <l n="57">Like gnomes are they , these spectral gleams ?</l>
     <l n="58">Or shall I guess them only dreams ?</l>
     <l n="59">Whatever is the truth , I say ,</l>

     <l n="4">Of twilight , melancholy in my house ,</l>
     <l n="5">And watch the flowing tide , the passing sails ,</l>
     <l n="6">Or to implore the air , and sea , and sky ,</l>
     <l n="7">For that eternal passion in their power</l>
     <l n="8">Which souls like mine who ponder on their fate</l>
     <l n="9">May feel , and be as they — gods to themselves .</l>

     <l n="29">The ancient pain ? Hark ! suddenly there came</l>
     <l n="30">From over sea , a sound like that of speech ;</l>
     <l n="31">And suddenly I felt my pulses leap</l>
     <l n="32">As though some Presence were approaching me .</l>
     <l n="33">Loud as the voice of Ocean 's dark-haired king</l>
     <l n="34">A breeze came down the sea ,— the sea rose high ;</l>
     <l n="35">The surging waves sang round me — this their song :</l>

     <l n="37">In love 's wild tumult ; he shall come once more ,—</l>
     <l n="38">By tracks of ocean or by paths of earth ;</l>
     <l n="39">The wanderer will reach you and remain . ”</l>
     <l n="40">The breakers dashed among the rocks , and they</l>
     <l n="41">Seemed full of life ; the foam dissolved the sands ,</l>
     <l n="42">And the sedge trembled in the swelling tide .</l>
     <l n="43">Was this a promise of the vaunting Sea ,</l>
     <l n="44">Or the illusion of a last despair ?</l>
     <l n="45">Either , or both , still homeward I must go ,</l>
     <l n="46">And that way turned mine eyes , and thought they met</l>
     <l n="47">A picture ,— surely so ,— or I was mad .</l>
     <l n="48">The crimson harvest-moon was rising full</l>
     <l n="49">Above my roof , and glimmered on my walls .</l>
     <l n="50">Within the doorway stood a man I knew —</l>
     <l n="51">No picture this . I saw approaching me</l>
     <l n="52">Him I had hoped for , grieved for , and despaired .</l>
     <l n="53">“ My ship is wrecked , ” he cried , “ and I return</l>
     <l n="54">Never to leave my love . You are my love ? ”</l>
     <l n="55">“ I too am wrecked , ” I sighed , “ by lonely years ;</l>
     <l n="56">Returning , you but find another wreck . ”</l>
     <l n="57">He bent his face to search my own , and spake :</l>
     <l n="58">“ What I have traversed sea and land to find ,</l>
     <l n="59">I find . For liberty I fought , and life ,</l>
     <l n="60">On savage shores and wastes of unknown seas ,</l>
     <l n="61">While waiting for this hour . Oh , think you not</l>
     <l n="62">Immortal love mates with immortal love</l>
     <l n="63">Always ? And now , at last , we know this love . ”</l>
     <l n="64">My soul was filling with a mighty joy</l>
     <l n="65">I could not show — yet must I show my love .</l>
     <l n="66">“ From you whose will divided broke our hearts</l>
     <l n="67">I now demand a different kiss than that</l>
     <l n="68">Which then you said should be our parting kiss .</l>
     <l n="69">Given , I vow the past shall be forgot .</l>
     <l n="70">The kiss — and we are one ! Give me the kiss . ”</l>
     <l n="71">Like the dark rocks upon the sands he stood ,</l>
     <l n="72">When on his breast I fell , and kissed his lips .</l>
     <l n="73">All the wild clangor of the sea was hushed ;</l>
     <l n="74">The rapid silver waves ran each to each ,</l>
     <l n="75">Lapsed in the deep with joyous , murmured sighs .</l>
     <l n="76">Years of repentance mine , forgiveness his ,</l>
     <l n="77">To tell . Happy , we paced the tranquil shores ,</l>
     <l n="78">Till between sea and sky we saw the sun ,</l>
     <l n="79">And all our wiser , loving days began .</l>

    <head>THE CHIMNEY-SWALLOW 'S IDYL .</head>
     <l n="1">From where I built the nest for my first young ,</l>
     <l n="2">In the high chimney of this ancient house ,</l>
     <l n="3">I saw the household fires burn and go down ,</l>
     <l n="4">And know what was and is forever gone .</l>
     <l n="5">My dusky , swift-winged fledgelings , flying far</l>
     <l n="6">To seek their mates in clustered eaves or towers ,</l>
     <l n="7">Would linger not to learn what I have learned ,</l>
     <l n="8">Soaring through air or steering over sea —</l>
     <l n="9">These single , solitary walls must fade .</l>
     <l n="10">But I return , inhabiting my nest ,</l>
     <l n="11">A little simple bird , which still survives</l>
     <l n="12">The noble souls now vanished from this hearth ;</l>
     <l n="13">And none are here besides but she who shares</l>
     <l n="14">My life , and pensive vigil holds with me .</l>
     <l n="15">No longer does she mourn ; she lives serene ;</l>
     <l n="16">I see her mother 's beauty in her face ,</l>
     <l n="17">I see her father 's quiet pride and power ,</l>
     <l n="18">The linked traits and traces of her race ;</l>
     <l n="19">Her brothers dying , like strong sapling trees</l>
     <l n="20">Hewn down by violent blows prone in dense woods ,</l>
     <l n="21">Covered with aged boughs , decaying slow .</l>
     <l n="22">She muses thus : “ Beauty once more abides ;</l>
     <l n="23">The rude alarm of death , its wild amaze</l>
     <l n="24">Is over now . The chance of change has passed ;</l>
     <l n="25">No doubtful hopes are mine , no restless dread ,</l>
     <l n="26">No last word to be spoken , kiss to give</l>
     <l n="27">And take in passion 's agony and end .</l>
     <l n="28">They cannot come to me , but in good time</l>
     <l n="29">I shall rejoin my silent company ,</l>
     <l n="30">And melt among them , as the sunset clouds</l>
     <l n="31">Melt in gray spaces of the coming night . ”</l>
     <l n="32">So she holds dear as I this tranquil spot ,</l>
     <l n="33">And all the flowers that blow , and maze of green ,</l>
     <l n="34">The meadows daisy-full , or brown and sere ;</l>
     <l n="35">The shore which bounds the waves I love to skim ,</l>
     <l n="36">And dash my purple wings against the breeze .</l>
     <l n="37">When breaks the day I twitter loud and long ,</l>
     <l n="38">To make her rise and watch the vigorous sun</l>
     <l n="39">Come from his sea-bed in the weltering deep ,</l>
     <l n="40">And smell the dewy grass , still rank with sleep .</l>
     <l n="41">I hover through the twilight round her eaves ,</l>
     <l n="42">And dart above , before her , in her path ,</l>
     <l n="43">Till , with a smile , she gives me all her mind ;</l>
     <l n="44">And in the deep of night , lest she be sad</l>
     <l n="45">In sleepless thought , I stir me in my nest ,</l>
     <l n="46">And murmur as I murmur to my young ;</l>
     <l n="47">She makes no answer , but I know she hears ;</l>
     <l n="48">And all the cherished pictures in her thoughts</l>
     <l n="49">Grow bright because of me , her swallow friend !</l>

    <head>LAST DAYS .</head>
     <l n="1">As one who follows a departing friend ,</l>
     <l n="2">Destined to cross the great , dividing sea ,</l>
     <l n="3">I watch and follow these departing days ,</l>
     <l n="4">That go so grandly , lifting up their crowns</l>
     <l n="5">Still regal , though their victor Autumn comes .</l>
     <l n="6">Gifts they bestow , which I accept , return ,</l>
     <l n="7">As gifts exchanged between a loving pair ,</l>
     <l n="8">Who may possess them as memorials</l>
     <l n="9">Of pleasures ended by the shadow — Death .</l>
     <l n="10">What matter which shall vanish hence , if both</l>
     <l n="11">Are transitory — me , and these bright hours —</l>
     <l n="12">And of the future ignorant alike ?</l>
     <l n="13">From all our social thralls I would be free .</l>
     <l n="14">Let care go down the wind — as hounds afar ,</l>
     <l n="15">Within their kennels baying unseen foes ,</l>
     <l n="16">Give to calm sleepers only calmer dreams .</l>
     <l n="17">Here will I rest alone : the morning mist</l>
     <l n="18">Conceals no form but mine ; the evening dew</l>
     <l n="19">Freshens but faded flowers and my worn face .</l>
     <l n="20">When the noon basks among the wooded hills</l>
     <l n="21">I too will bask , as silent as the air</l>
     <l n="22">So thick with sun-motes , dyed like yellow gold ,</l>
     <l n="23">Or colored purple like an unplucked plum .</l>
     <l n="24">The thrush , now lonesome , for her young have flown ,</l>
     <l n="25">May flutter her brown wings across my path ;</l>
     <l n="26">And creatures of the sod with brilliant eyes</l>
     <l n="27">May leap beside me , and familiar grow .</l>
     <l n="28">The moon shall rise among her floating clouds ,</l>
     <l n="29">Black , vaporous fans , and crinkled globes of pearl ,</l>
     <l n="30">And her sweet silver light be given to me .</l>
     <l n="31">To watch and follow these departing days</l>
     <l n="32">Must be my choice ; and let me mated be</l>
     <l n="33">With Solitude ; may memory and hope</l>
     <l n="34">Unite to give me faith that nothing dies ;</l>
     <l n="35">To show me always , what I pray to know ,</l>
     <l n="36">That man alone may speak the word — Farewell .</l>
