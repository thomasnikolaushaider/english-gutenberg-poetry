   <p>X O childhood days enchanted ! O the magic of the spring</p>
   <p>XI To — smile , behind my lesson , at that old sweetheart of mine</p>
   <p>XII A face of lily-beauty , with a form of airy grace</p>
   <p>XIII When first I kissed her , and she answered the caress</p>
   <p>XIV I slipped the apple in it — and the teacher did n't know</p>
   <p>XV She gave me her photograph , and printed “ Ever Thine ”</p>
   <p>XVI And again I feel the pressure of her slender little hand</p>
   <p>XVII Where the vines were ever fruited , and the weather ever fine</p>
   <p>XVIII And she my faithful sweetheart till the golden hair was gray</p>
   <p>XIX The door is softly opened , and — my wife is standing there</p>
   <p>The ordered intermingling of the real and the dream ,— The mill above the river , and the mist above the stream ; The life of ceaseless labor , brave with song and cheery call — The radiant skies of evening , with its rainbow o'er us all .</p>
   <p>AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE !— Is this her presence here with me , Or but a vain creation of a lover 's memory ?</p>
   <p>A fair , illusive vision that would vanish into air Dared I even touch the silence with the whisper of a prayer ?</p>
   <figure>
    <p>Illustration</p>
   </figure>
   <p>Nay , let me then believe in all the blended false and true — The semblance of the old love and the substance of the new ,—</p>
   <p>The then of changeless sunny days — the now of shower and shine — But Love forever smiling ,— as that old sweetheart of mine .</p>
   <figure>
    <p>Illustration</p>
   </figure>
   <p>This ever-restful sense of home , though shouts ring in the hall .— The easy-chair — the old bookshelves and prints along the wall ;</p>
   <p>The rare Habanas in their box , or gaunt churchwarden-stem That often wags , above the jar , derisively at them .</p>
   <figure>
    <p>Illustration</p>
   </figure>
   <p>As one who cons at evening o'er an album , all alone , And muses on the faces of the friends that he has known ,</p>
   <p>So I turn the leaves of Fancy , till , in shadowy design , I find the smiling features of an old sweetheart of mine .</p>
   <figure>
    <p>Illustration</p>
   </figure>
   <p>The lamplight seems to glimmer with a flicker of surprise , As I turn it low — to rest me of the dazzle in my eyes ,</p>
   <p>And light my pipe in silence , save a sigh that seems to yoke Its fate with my tobacco and to vanish with the smoke .</p>
   <figure>
    <p>Illustration</p>
   </figure>
   <p>‘ Tis a fragrant retrospection ,— for the loving thoughts that start Into being are like perfume from the blossom of the heart ;</p>
   <p>And to dream the old dreams over is a luxury divine — When my truant fancies wander with that old sweetheart of mine .</p>
   <figure>
    <p>Illustration</p>
   </figure>
   <p>Though I hear beneath my study , like a fluttering of wings , The voices of my children and the mother as she sings —</p>
   <p>I feel no twinge of conscience to deny me any theme When Care has cast her anchor In the harbor of a dream —</p>
   <figure>
    <p>Illustration</p>
   </figure>
   <p>In fact , to speak in earnest , I believe it adds a charm To spice the good a trifle with a little dust of harm ,—</p>
   <p>For I find an extra flavor in Memory 's mellow wine That makes me drink the deeper to that old sweetheart of mine .</p>
   <figure>
    <p>Illustration</p>
   </figure>
   <p>O Childhood-days enchanted ! O the magic of the Spring !— With all green boughs to blossom white , and all bluebirds to sing !</p>
   <p>When all the air , to toss and quaff , made life a jubilee And changed the children 's song and laugh to shrieks of ecstasy .</p>
   <figure>
    <p>Illustration</p>
   </figure>
   <p>With eyes half closed in clouds that ooze from lips that taste , as well , The peppermint and cinnamon , I hear the old School-bell ,</p>
   <p>And from “ Recess ” romp in again from “ Blackman 's ” broken line , To — smile , behind my “ lesson ” , at that old sweetheart of mine .</p>
   <figure>
    <p>Illustration</p>
   </figure>
   <p>A face of lily-beauty , with a form of airy grace , Floats out of my tobacco as the “ Genii ” from the vase</p>
   <p>And I thrill beneath the glances of a pair of azure eyes As glowing as the summer and as tender as the skies .</p>
   <figure>
    <p>Illustration</p>
   </figure>
   <p>I can see the pink sunbonnet and the little , checkered dress She wore when first I kissed her and she answered the caress</p>
   <p>With the written declaration that , “ As surely as the vine Grew ‘ round the stump , ” she loved me — that old sweetheart of mine .</p>
   <figure>
    <p>Illustration</p>
   </figure>
   <p>Again I make her presents , in a really helpless way ,— The big “ Rhode Island Greening ” — ( I was hungry too , that day ! ) —</p>
   <p>But I follow her from Spelling , with her hand behind her — so — And I slip the apple in it — and the Teacher does n't know !</p>
   <figure>
    <p>Illustration</p>
   </figure>
   <p>I give my treasures to her — all ,— my pencil — blue-and-red ;— And , if little girls played marbles , mine should all be hers , instead !—</p>
   <p>But she gave me her photograph , and printed “ Ever Thine ” Across the back — in blue-and-red — that old sweetheart of mine !</p>
   <figure>
    <p>Illustration</p>
   </figure>
   <p>And again I feel the pressure of her slender little hand , As we used to talk together of the future we had planned ,—</p>
   <p>When I should be a poet , and with nothing else to do But write the tender verses that she set the music to ....</p>
   <figure>
    <p>Illustration</p>
   </figure>
   <p>When we should live together in a cozy little cot Hid in a nest of roses , with a fairy garden-spot ,</p>
   <p>Where the vines were ever fruited and the weather ever fine , And the birds were ever singing for that old sweetheart of mine ....</p>
   <figure>
    <p>Illustration</p>
   </figure>
   <p>When I should be her lover forever and a day , And she my faithful sweetheart till the golden hair was gray ;</p>
   <p>And we should be so happy that when either 's lips were dumb They would not smile in Heaven till the other 's kiss had come .</p>
   <figure>
    <p>Illustration</p>
   </figure>
   <p>But , ah ! my dream is broken by a step upon the stair , And the door is softly opened , and — my wife is standing there :</p>
   <p>Yet with eagerness and rapture all my visions I resign ,— To greet the living presence of that old sweetheart of mine .</p>
