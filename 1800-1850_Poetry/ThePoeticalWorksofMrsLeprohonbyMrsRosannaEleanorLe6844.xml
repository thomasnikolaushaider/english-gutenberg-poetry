    <head>INTRODUCTION .</head>
    <p n="1">When , in after ages , the literature of Canada comes to be written , it is to be hoped that among the mighty sons and daughters of genius now unknown , or as yet unborn , some room will be kept for the brave and loving pioneers who “ gave the people of their best , ” and sang the songs of duty and patriotism and hope , ere life in our young land had ceased to be a struggle . With the growth of wealth and the spread of prosperity , will come leisure for more than material interests ; and thus , in course of time , the author who has something to say will find an audience , prepared by culture and not too busy to listen to it . And , as supply is generally commensurate with demand , there will then be a literary class of corresponding merit . At least , something like this has been the rule in the progress of nations . But if those who come after , thus favored by circumstances , surpass their predecessors in literary skill or power , not less deserving are the latter who , with little prospect of reward , bore the burden and the heat of the day . This early stage in a nation 's literature has , indeed , an interest and a value of its own , which only meet with due appreciation from a judicious and grateful posterity . If it has not the rich , warm splendor of the later morning , it has the welcome promise of the dawn , and a tender beauty of its own .</p>
    <p n="2">In this band of pioneers Mrs. Leprohon must be conceded a distinguished place . None of them has employed rare gifts of head and heart to better purpose ; none of them had a wider range of sympathy ; none of them did more willing service , with the purest motives , in all good causes . And , it may be added , none of them was more happy in attaining , during life , the admiration and friendship of a large though select circle of every creed and race among her compatriots . It is in order to place in the hands of those who thus loved and honored her a memorial of what she was at her best , intellectually and morally , that this little volume has been prepared . It contains the emotional record of a blameless and beautiful life , the outcome of a mind that thought no evil of any one , but overflowed with loving kindness to all . Before pointing out , however , what we consider the salient qualities in Mrs. Leprohon 's poetry , it may be well to give our readers a brief sketch of her too short career .</p>
    <p n="3">Rosanna Eleanor Mullins was born in the city of Montreal in the year 1832 . It is almost unnecessary to state that she was educated at the Convent of the Congregation of Notre Dame , so numerous are her affectionate tributes to the memories of dear friends associated with that institution . Long before her education was completed , she had given evidence of no common literary ability . She was , indeed , only fourteen years old when she made her earliest essays in verse and prose . Before she had bid adieu to the years and scenes of girlhood , she had already won a reputation as a writer of considerable promise , and as long as Mr. John Lovell conducted the Literary Garland , Miss Mullins was one of his leading contributors . She continued to write for that excellent magazine until lack of financial success compelled its enterprising proprietor to suspend its publication . It was some time before another such opportunity was given to the Canadian votaries of the muses of reaching the cultivated public . In the meanwhile , however , the subject of our sketch — who had , in 1851 , become the wife of Dr. J. L. Leprohon , a member of one of the most distinguished Canadian families — was far from being idle . Some of her productions she sent to the Boston Pilot , the faithful representative in the United States of the land and the creed to which Mrs. Leprohon was proud to belong . She was also a frequent and welcome contributor to several of the Montreal journals . It is a pleasing evidence of her gentle thoughtfulness for a class which many persons in her position regard with indifference that she wrote , year after year , the “ News-boy 's Address ” for the True Witness , the Daily News and other newspapers . One of her most pathetic poems , “ The Death of the Pauper Child ” may also be mentioned as a striking instance of that sweet charity which comprehended in its sisterly range the poor , the desolate and the suffering . The Journal of Education , edited by the Hon . P. J. O. Chauveau , himself an honor to Canadian Literature ; the Canadian Illustrated News , edited by Mr. John Lesperance , distinguished both as a poet and a novelist ; the Saturday Reader , the Hearthstone , and other periodicals , both in Canada and elsewhere , were always glad to number Mrs. Leprohon 's productions among their most attractive features . She had always a ready pen , the result of a full heart and far-reaching sympathies , and , therefore , was frequently asked to write on subjects of current interest . Among her “ occasional ” poems ; several of which are in this volume , may be mentioned the touching stanzas on the “ Monument to the Irish Emigrants , ” those on the “ Old Towers ” at the “ Priest 's Farm , ” those on the renewal of her vows by the Lady Abbess of the Congregation of Notre Dame , the poem on the “ Recollect Church , ” and the address “ To the Soldiers of Pius The Ninth . ” One of her most important efforts of this kind was her translation of the Cantata composed by M. Sempé on the occasion of the visit of the Prince of Wales to Canada in 1860 .</p>
    <p n="4">We have attempted such a classification of the poems as we thought would best show the range of Mrs. Leprohon 's powers . Under every one of the headings which we have adopted the reader will find something to profit and delight . The lover of nature will find himself carried in fancy to the fairest or grandest of Canadian scenes ; he who loves to indulge in reveries of the past can with her stand with Jacques Cartier on Mount Royal three centuries ago and survey the mighty expanse of forest , destined one day to be the home of a thriving people ; those whose pleasure it is to read of heroic deeds will hear her sing of ennobling courage and fortitude that blenched not at death . But by many , we think , Mrs. Leprohon will be most cherished as she tells in sweet and simple rhyme of the tenderness of a mother 's love , of a wife 's devotion , a husband 's loyal trust , of the pious offices of the domestic altar , of the parting by the death-bed that is not without hope , of the loved and lost that yet are “ not lost but only gone before . ” To illustrate these varied characteristics by quotation would demand far more , than our allotted space . We can , therefore , only refer the reader to the book itself , confident that in its pages he will find all that we have indicated and much more .</p>
    <p n="5">Just a word as to Mrs. Leprohon 's prose writings . Though in this sketch we have dwelt upon her work as a poet , it is as a writer of fiction that she has won her most marked popular successes , that she has reached the hearts of the two great communities of which this province is composed . For no less than four of her most elaborate tales have been translated into French ; these are , Ida Beresford , the Manor House of Villerati , Antoinette de Mirecourt , and Armand Durand . Besides these , she has written Florence FitzHarding , Eva Huntingdon , Clarence FitzClarence and Eveleen O'Donnell . In the Manor House of Villerai she has described with a skilful pen the manners and customs of the forefathers of the French Canadian people , such as they were at the period of the great contest which changed the destinies of Canada . In Armand Durand we have a courageous struggle with adverse fortune , which is at last crowned with success . The sad consequences of secret marriage , unblessed by parental consent , are unfolded in Antoinette de Mirecourt , one of the finest of Mrs. Leprohon 's novels , and of which the French translation has lately been honored by a new edition . Of her merits as a novelist one of the ablest of French Canadian critics writes thus : “ Gifted with a deep knowledge of the human heart , she finds in domestic life the subject of attractive pictures , full of delicacy and good taste , which she dramatizes with remarkable power . Her charm lies , not in any complication of intrigue or in problems hard to solve , but in a skilful working out of details , in incidents which fix the reader 's attention , in the conception of her characters , in the painting of personal traits , in purity of thought , in sweetness of sentiment , in beauty of style , in the harmony of the parts , and in the most scrupulous regard for morality . ” This is high praise , and it comes from high authority . We will simply add that , with a few necessary changes , it may also be applied to Mrs. Leprohon 's poems .</p>
    <p n="6">From this imperfect sketch of Mrs. Leprohon 's literary life it will be seen that she was no sluggard . But we would leave a wrong impression if we gave it to be understood that all her time was passed in the writing of either poems or tales . Far from it . They constituted but one phase in a life nobly , yet unostentatiously , consecrated to the duties of home , of society , of charity and of religion . Mrs. Leprohon was much more than either a poet or a novelist — she was , also , in the highest sense , a woman , a lady . Had she never written a verse of poetry or a page of prose , she would still have been lovingly remembered for what she was as wife , as mother , as friend . It is , in a great part , because they are associated with her in these more endearing aspects , that they are the true mental and moral offspring of her very self , that those who knew her will find in them so much to prize . Alas ! these and loving memories , that can scarce be separated from them , are now all that is left of her . On the 20th of September , 1879 , after a tedious illness , endured with Christian resignation , she passed away . She did not live to receive the reward that was her due on earth , but that which is above is hers , and her works live after her , and a memory that will not perish .</p>
    <p n="7">In conclusion , we will just allow ourselves to point out that , in connection with her comparatively early death , there is a touching interest attached to some of her poems , such , especially , as “ The Parting Soul to her Guardian Angel ” and “ The Voices of the Death Chamber . ” In the former she says :</p>
    <p n="8">“ Thy soft-breathed hopes with magic might Have chased from my soul the shades of night . Console the dear ones I part from now , Who hang o'er my couch with pallid brow ; Tell them , we 'll meet in yon shining sky , And , Angel Guardian , I now can die . ”</p>
    <p n="9">And in the latter , which has all the vividness of an actual death-scene , as the husband and children from whom she must part are kneeling by the bed-side , the sufferer says :</p>
    <p n="10">“ Oh ! if earthly love could conquer The mighty power of death , His love would stay the current Of my failing strength and breath ; And that voice whose loving fondness Has been my earthly stay Could half tempt me from the voices That are calling me away . ”</p>
    <p n="11">But at last they come nearer and sound louder , till they “ drown all sounds of mortal birth , ” and “ in their wild triumphal sweetness , ” lure her away from earth to Heaven .</p>

   <p>THE WHITE CANOE .</p>
   <p>A LEGEND OF NIAGARA FALLS .</p>
   <p>In days long gone by it was the custom of the Indian warriors of the forest to assemble at the Great Cataract and offer a human sacrifice to the Spirit of the Falls . The offering consisted of a white canoe , full of ripe fruits and blooming flowers , which was paddled over the terrible cliff by the fairest girl of the tribe . It was counted an honor not only by the tribe to whose lot it fell to make the costly sacrifice , but even by the doomed maiden herself . The only daughter of a widowed Chief of the Seneca Indians was chosen as a sacrificial offering to the Spirit of Niagara . Tolonga , the Great Elk , was bravest among the warriors , and devotedly attached to his child , but , when the lot fell on her , he crushed down in the pride of Indian endurance the feelings of grief that filled his bosom . The eventful night arrived . The moon arose and shone brightly down oh the turmoil of Niagara , when the White Canoe and its precious freight glided from the bank and swept out into the dread rapid . The young girl calmly steered towards the centre of the stream , when suddenly another canoe shot forth upon the water and , under the strong impulse of the Seneca Chief , flew like an arrow to destruction . It overtook the first ; the eyes of father and child met in a parting gaze of love , and then they plunged together over the Cataract into Eternity .</p>

    <head>THE RECOLLECT CHURCH . *</head>
    <note>* In process of demolition when this poem was written . The Recollect Friars purchased the ground on which the church in question was built in 1692 , and on it they constructed a temporary chapel . The actual edifice , however , was not erected till about the year 1706 . The order is now extinct . After the conquest their property was confiscated by the Government , and subsequently exchanged for St. Helen 's Island , then belonging to Baron Grant . For a time the Recollect Church served as a place of worship for both Protestants and Catholics , and for many years was exclusively devoted to the use of the Irish Catholics .</note>

     <l n="1">How hushed and still are earth and air ,</l>
     <l n="2">How languid ‘ neath the sun 's fierce ray —</l>
     <l n="3">Drooping and faint — the flowrets fair ,</l>
     <l n="4">On this hot , sultry , summer day !</l>
     <l n="5">Vainly I watch the streamlet blue</l>
     <l n="6">That near my cottage home doth pass ,</l>
     <l n="7">No ripple stirs its azure hue ,</l>

     <l n="9">And if I woo from yonder trees</l>

     <l n="12">Rustles amid their foliage now ;</l>
     <l n="13">Yes , hush ! there stirred a leaf , but no ,</l>
     <l n="14">Tis only some poor , panting bird ,</l>
     <l n="15">With silenced note , head drooping low ,</l>
     <l n="16">That ‘ mid the shady green boughs stirred .</l>

     <l n="20">Oblivious o'er its pages droop —</l>
     <l n="21">And motion is beyond my power ,</l>
     <l n="22">While breathing this hot , scorching air ,</l>
     <l n="23">It wearies me to raise the flowers ,</l>
     <l n="24">That lie so close beside my chair .</l>

     <l n="25">See stealing , wearied from their play ,</l>

     <l n="28">They 'd much prefer to stay at home .</l>
     <l n="29">Themselves upon the ground they throw ,</l>
     <l n="30">Cheeks pillowed on each rounded arm —</l>
     <l n="31">And fall asleep soon , murmuring low ,</l>
     <l n="32">And wondering “ why it is so warm ? ”</l>

     <l n="33">If yonder patient sheep and kine ,</l>

     <l n="36">They surely would repeat the same —</l>
     <l n="37">Each blade of grass , each fainting flower ,</l>
     <l n="38">Would whisper to the shrubs and trees ,</l>
     <l n="39">How much they longed for evening 's hour ,</l>
     <l n="40">With cooling breath and grateful breeze .</l>

     <l n="12">Had to use the sword as well as the plough ;</l>
     <l n="13">When women ( no lovelier now than then )</l>

   <p>MONUMENT TO IRISH EMIGRANTS .</p>
   <p>It will be in the recollection of many of our readers that during the famine years of 1847 and 1848 there was an unusual emigration from Ireland to Canada and the United States . Numbers of those who thus left their native land expired from ship fever , caused by utter exhaustion , before they reached the American continent ; others only arrived there to die of that fatal disease . The Canadian Government made extensive efforts to save the lives of the poor emigrants . A large proportion were spared , but at Montreal , where the Government erected temporary hospitals , on an immense scale , upwards of 6000 of these poor people died . Their remains were interred close to the hospitals , at a place that is now mainly covered with railway buildings , and in close proximity to the point whence the Victoria Bridge projects into the St. Lawrence . All traces of the sad events of that disastrous period would have been obliterated but for the warm and reverential impulses of Mr. James Hodges , the engineer and representative of Messrs. Peto , Brassey &amp; Betts in Canada . Through his instrumentality , and by his encouragement , the workmen at the bridge came to the determination of erecting a monument on the spot where the poor Irish emigrants were interred . An enormous granite boulder , of a rough conical shape , weighing 30 tons , was dug up in the vicinity , and was placed on a base of cut stone masonry , twelve feet square by six feet high . The stone bears the following inscription : “ To preserve from desecration the remains of 6000 emigrants who died from ship fever in 1847 and 1848 this monument is erected by workmen in the employment of Messrs. Peto , Brassey , &amp; Betts , engaged in the construction of the Victoria Bridge , 1859 . ” Several addresses were delivered on the occasion , and in the course of that made by the Bishop of Montreal he alluded in feeling terms to the many good deeds for which the Dame of his friend , Mr. James Hodges , will be gratefully remembered in Canada . Thanks to the latter , the plot of ground on which the monument is raised is set apart for ever , so that the remains of those interred there will henceforth be sacred from any irreverent treatment .</p>

    <head>The following verses were suggested by a touching ceremony which lately took place in the chapel of the Congregation Convent , Notre Dame , Montreal , the beloved Institution in which the happy days of my girlhood were passed . The ceremony in question was the renewal of her vows by the Venerable Mother Superior , just fifty years from the date of her first profession , which was made at the early age of fifteen . In the world , in the few rare instances in which both bride and bridegroom live to witness the fiftieth anniversary of their union , the “ golden wedding , ” as it is usually called , is generally celebrated with great pomp and rejoicing ; tis but just , then , that in religion , the faithful spouses of the Saviour should welcome with equal satisfaction the anniversary of the epoch which witnessed the mystical union contracted with their Heavenly Bridegroom .</head>

    <head>NARRATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE POEMS .</head>
    <head>RED ROCK CAMP .</head>
    <head>A TALE OF EARLY COLORADO .</head>
     <l n="1">My simple story is of those times ere the magic power of steam</l>
     <l n="2">First whirled the traveller o'er the plains with the swiftness of</l>
     <l n="3">a dream ,</l>
     <l n="4">Reducing to a few days ’ time the journey of many a week ,</l>
     <l n="5">That fell of old to the miner 's lot ere he “ sighted ” tall Pikes</l>
     <l n="6">Peak .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>‘ Neath liquid sunshine filling the air , ‘ mid masses of wild flowers gay , A prairie waggon followed the track that led o'er the plains away ; And most of those ‘ neath its canvas roof were of lawless type and rude — Miners , broad-chested and strongly built , a reckless , gold-seeking brood .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Yet two of the number surely seemed most strangely out of place ,</l>
     <l n="2">A girl with fragile , graceful form , shy look , and beauteous face ,</l>
     <l n="3">One who had wrought out the old , old tale , left her home and</l>
     <l n="4">friends for aye ,</l>
     <l n="5">Braved family frowns and strangers ’ smiles , love 's promptings to</l>
     <l n="6">obey .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="7">And the lover husband at her side no miner rough was he ,</l>
     <l n="8">If we may believe the shapely hands as a woman 's fair to see ;</l>
     <l n="9">But his tall , lithe form , so strongly knit , firm mouth and look</l>
     <l n="10">of pride ,</l>
     <l n="11">Told of iron will , resolved to win a home for his darling bride .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="12">Tender he was , but the plains were vast , toilsome and tedious the</l>
     <l n="13">way ,</l>
     <l n="14">Developing soon the fever germs that within her latent lay ,</l>
     <l n="15">And daily the velvet azure eyes with a brighter lustre burned ,</l>
     <l n="16">And the hectic flush of the waxen cheek to a deeper carmine</l>
     <l n="17">turned .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Oh ! dread was the time ‘ neath that canvas close when she bravely fought for breath , Fire in her veins , while panting came each laboring painful breath ! At length one eve she clasped his neck , with a wild and wailing cry : “ O , darling , lay me on God 's green earth , ‘ neath his sun bright clouds to die ! ”</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Mutely the bridegroom caught her up after that touching appeal ;</l>
     <l n="2">Why refuse her prayer when on her brow was already set death 's</l>
     <l n="3">seal ?</l>
     <l n="4">To proffered help and rough words of hope , to protests whispered</l>
     <l n="5">low ,</l>
     <l n="6">He murmured , “ Leave us , go on your way ! Comrades it must be so . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="7">Then , in the eyes of those reckless men bright tears were</l>
     <l n="8">glistening seen ,</l>
     <l n="9">For in their rugged , though willing , way most kindly had they</l>
     <l n="10">been ;</l>
     <l n="11">No selfish fears of sickness dire had they shown by look or word ,</l>
     <l n="12">For whate'er of good dwelt within each heart that helpless girl</l>
     <l n="13">had stirred .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>They raised a tent , and from their stores they brought the very best , Whisp'ring of speedy help to come as each clammy hand they pressed . “ Nay , friends , ” he said with a short , sharp laugh , more painful than sob to hear , “ No help send back , for myself and wife must perforce both settle here . ”</p>
   <p>Then he sat him down , and placed her head on his aching , throbbing breast , While the sweeping rush of the prairie winds seemed to bring relief and rest , And her dim eye watched , without a shade of regret or passing pain , The receding waggon , soon a speck on the wide and boundless plain .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ O Will ! on your true and tender heart , happy and calm I die ,</l>
     <l n="2">For I know our lives , though severed here , will be joined again</l>
     <l n="3">on high :</l>
     <l n="4">One kiss , my husband , loving and loved , one clasp of thy strong</l>
     <l n="5">kind hand ,</l>
     <l n="6">One farewell look in thy mournful eyes ere I pass to the Spirit</l>
     <l n="7">Land !</l>
   </lg>
   <p>“ But , God ! what is this ? ” she wildly asks with hurried , panting gasp ; Her fingers have touched a weapon of death in her husband 's hand close clasped : “ O , surely , you would not — dare not — go uncalled to your Maker 's sight ? ” “ Wife , when passes your spirit away , mine , too , shall take its flight . ”</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">It boots not to tell of the loving prayers that welled from that</l>
     <l n="2">true wife 's heart ,</l>
     <l n="3">She sued with an angels holy power , a woman 's winning art ,</l>
     <l n="4">Till that desp'rate man , with quick low sob , his weapon tossed</l>
     <l n="5">away ,</l>
     <l n="6">And promised , till came his Maker 's call , on this cheerless earth</l>
     <l n="7">to stay .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="8">Then sunshine lit up her wan white face and brightened her</l>
     <l n="9">failing eyes ,</l>
     <l n="10">Enkindling upon her marble cheek the glow of the sunset skies ;</l>
     <l n="11">Closer she nestled unto his breast with a smile of childlike</l>
     <l n="12">bliss ;</l>
     <l n="13">“ Already a foretaste of yon bright Heaven is given me , Will , in</l>
     <l n="14">this ! ”</l>

     <l n="15">A little while and the lashes drooped , unstirred by life 's faint</l>

     <l n="18">by Death .</l>
     <l n="19">With the second sunset he laid her in her lonely prairie grave ,</l>
     <l n="20">Then joined a passing miner 's band that a friendly welcome gave .</l>
