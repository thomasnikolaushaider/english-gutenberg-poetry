   <p>Governor Winthrop 's Return to Boston .</p>
   <p>On the seventeenth day of September , A. D. 1880 , the two hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the foundation of the town of Boston , the event was commemorated , among other ways , by the inauguration of the statue of John Winthrop , in Scollay Square . He is represented by the renowned sculptor in the garb of a gentleman of his day , holding in his hand the royal charter of the Massachusetts Colony , which he brought over with him .</p>
   <p>His serene countenance falls like a benediction upon this city of ours , which shows a wonderful and prosperous growth . He may be said to be the founder of the First Church of Boston , of the City itself , and of this Christian Commonwealth ,— a threefold distinction . To have been the founder of a single one of these would have insured his immortal fame .</p>
   <p>He was also the author of the covenant of the First Church , which was gathered in Charlestown , Aug. 27 , 1630 , and which soon after removed to the Boston side of Charles River . The covenant is in these words :—</p>
   <p>“ In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ , and in obedience to His holy and divine ordinance ,—</p>
   <p>“ We , whose names are hereunder written , being by His most wise and good providence brought together into this part of America , in the Bay of Massachusetts , and desirous to unite ourselves into one congregation or church , under the Lord Jesus Christ , our Head , in such sort as becometh all those whom He hath redeemed and sanctified to Himself , do hereby solemnly and religiously ( as in His most holy presence ) promise and bind ourselves to walk in all our ways according to the rule of the Gospel and in all sincere conformity to His holy ordinances , and in mutual love and respect , each to other , so near as God shall give us grace . ”</p>
   <p>Probably there are very few , if any , original documents in America of so ancient a date which have been preserved , and which are still in force , as this identical covenant , which has been signed and kept by hundreds in each generation for nearly three centuries . Far superior to the Andover creed , or to any other creed of seminary , council , or church , it has ever been a bond of union , and not a bone of contention . Aptly phrased and including all the essential conditions of a vital church organization , it will stand for centuries to come , and will outlast all creeds of human invention , ever promoting beneficence and charity .</p>
   <p>This poem represents the spirit of Governor Winthrop returning to the city and the capital of the Christian Commonwealth he had founded , and taking possession of the bodily form which the artist has reproduced of him , clothed in his own antique costume . He surveys the extended limits of Boston , including Charlestown , with Bunker Hill Monument , and four other townships with hundreds of church steeples pointing to the sky . He misses from the old site on Cornhill the single house of worship where Wilson and Cotton preached , and where he was wont to expound ; but soon he descries from afar , in his mind 's eye , standing where , in his time , the waves of the sea were surging , the beautiful church edifice and the elegant chapel where five hundred Sunday-scholars are weekly taught . He dwells with supreme satisfaction upon the good deeds done by the church he established , and predicts for it a still more prosperous future and a greater spiritual growth . He recognizes only two things which existed in his day , and have remained unchanged ,— the church covenant he wrote , as it were , by inspiration , or at least by a wise forecast of future needs , and the Communion cup he gave , which has singularly escaped the hazards of fire and the chances of time , and which has been , ever since , constantly used in the holy commemorative service .</p>
   <p>Upon these almost universal changes he makes some appropriate reflections . To “ sit in the stocks ” was a punishment commonly imposed in his time for various offences . Richard Frothingham , in his “ History of Charlestown , ” gives a view of the stocks that were set in the market-place with this mode of punishment applied . The view is here reproduced . “ It was much used , ” says Frothingham , “ and several times repaired . A sentence by the selectmen for ‘ drinking to excess , ’ shows that one hour 's sitting in the stocks could be compromised by paying 3s . 4d . money . ” Winthrop , of course , would be struck with the different use of the word now so frequently spoken . From the fact that all investments of his day are swept out of existence , he predicts that the properties now held as most secure and reliable will in as long a time disappear . He illustrates the superiority of man , in his own best estate , to all worldly possessions .</p>

   <p>His allusion to the vision of Rev . John Wilson , the first minister of the church , recalls the following passage in his diary as quoted by Hon . Robert C. Winthrop in his “ Life and Letters of John Winthrop , ” vol . 2 , page 108 .</p>
   <p>“ The pastor of Boston , Mr. Wilson , a very sincere , holy man , ... told the governour that , before he was resolved to come into this country , he dreamed he was here , and that he saw a church arise out of the earth , which grew up and became a marvellous goodly church . ”</p>
   <p>The present church edifice well answers this description ; built with exquisite taste after a most appropriate design , and bearing the palm of all the costly churches in the new part of Boston for fitness , beauty , and permanency .</p>

   </lg>
   <p>The Thursday Lecture , which was the special clerical and social occasion of his time , he finds abolished ; and he observes that the Thursday Evening Club is now a characteristic feature of Boston . This was formed for social , scientific , and literary objects . Among its founders and early members were Edward Everett , a member of First Church , and Hon . Robert C. Winthrop , the distinguished descendant and representative of the Winthrop family . The one referred to in this interview as the then leader of the Club was its late President , William B. Rogers . He was a man of superior scientific attainments , with a power of apt expression and a felicity and fluency of utterance indeed remarkable . By his efforts and influence the Massachusetts Institute of Technology was established ,— a lasting monument of his zeal for technical science , the most needed factor in popular education . In making an address to the Institute at its Commencement exercises , May 30 , 1882 , he was struck with death ; he left the very place of his heart 's and life 's devotion for the spirit land of Winthrop . His predecessors in the office of President of the Club were John C. Warren , the nephew of General Joseph Warren , Edward Everett , J. Mason Warren , and Bishop Manton Eastburn . The historic mantle of the office has now been cast on Colonel Theodore Lyman , upon whose well-stored and lofty head honors have fallen thick , but no faster than merited .</p>
   <p>Josiah Quincy the elder , the second on the roll of Boston 's distinguished Mayors , declared that the City might well adopt Winthrop as its patron saint . His was an ideal , saintly life , and his character , in a sense , supernatural . He bore success and defeat in a political election with like equanimity , a trait that , as it were , by a law of heredity marks with special honor his living representative . Whether in office or out , and possessing large estates or , one after another , deprived of them , he kept his mind active and his brain industriously working for the development of a higher social life under Christian culture in a virgin land , by his leadership , under the Providence he devoutly acknowledged , to be fitted and fashioned for a new and powerful country , of which Boston was to be a memorable city .</p>
   <p>Nor could he fail to remark upon the location of the statue set up in his honor in Scollay Square , rather than on Boston Common , which he had laid out and secured to posterity . The City Square in Charlestown , where he first unrolled the old charter of the Colony before the new government at its first meeting here , would have been a better site for it than the one selected .</p>
   <p>Difficult it is , indeed , to set down in worthy lines the remembrance of the interview herein depicted . Of course , it has been faintly and inadequately done . Let us hope , however , that , should Winthrop 's spirit , two or three centuries hence , visit again the last and most eventful scenes of his earthly life , he will find Boston , though changed anew , yet vastly improved , keeping pace with all developments for the good of an ever advancing race , and second to none in the Commonwealth or Nation in true excellence and progress .</p>
