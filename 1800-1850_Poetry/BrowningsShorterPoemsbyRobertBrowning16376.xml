    <head>PREFACE</head>
    <p n="1">These selections from the poetry of Robert Browning have been made with especial reference to the tastes and capacities of readers of the high-school age . Every poem included has been found by experience to be within the grasp of boys and girls . Most of Browning 's best poetry is within the ken of any reader of imagination and diligence . To the reader who lacks these , not only Browning , but the great world of literature , remains closed : Browning is not the only poet who requires close study . The difficulties he offers are , in his best poems , not more repellent to the thoughtful reader than the nut that protects and contains the kernel . To a boy or girl of active mind , the difficulty need rarely be more than a pleasant challenge to the exercise of a little patience and ingenuity .</p>
    <p n="2">Browning , when at his best in vigor , clearness , and beauty , is peculiarly a poet for young people . His freedom from sentimentality , his liveliness of conception and narration , his high optimism , and his interest in the things that make for the life of the soul , appeal to the imagination and the feelings of youth .</p>
    <p n="3">The present edition , attempts but little in the way of criticism . The notes cover such matters as are not readily settled by an appeal to the dictionary , and suggest , in addition , questions that are designed to help in interpretation and appreciation .</p>

    <body>
     <p>Browning 's good fortune began with his birth . His father , a clerk in the Bank of England , possessed ample means for the education of his children . He had artistic and literary tastes , a mind richly stored with philosophy , history , literature , and legend , some repute as a maker of verses , and a liberality that led him to assist his gifted son in following his bent . From his father Robert inherited his literary tastes and his vigorous health ; in his father he found a critic and companion . His mother was described by Carlyle as a type of the true Scotch gentlewoman . Her “ fathomless charity , ” her love of music , and her deep religious feeling reappear in the poet .</p>
     <p>Free from struggles with adversity , and devoid of public or stirring incidents , the story of Browning 's life is soon told . It was the life of a scholar and man of letters , devoted to the study of poetry , philosophy , history ; to the contemplation of the lives of men and women ; and to the exercise of his chosen vocation .</p>
     <p>His school life was of meagre extent . He attended a private academy , read at home under a tutor , and for two years attended the University of London . When asked in his later life whether he had been to Oxford or Cambridge , he used to say , “ Italy was my University , ” And , indeed , his many poems on Italian themes bear testimony to the profound influence of Italy upon him . In his teens , he came under the influence of Pope and Byron , and wrote verses after their styles . Then Shelley came by accident in his way , and became to the boy the model of poetic excellence .</p>
     <p>In 1838 appeared his first published poem , Pauline . It bears the marks of his peculiar genius ; it has the germs of his merits and his defects . Though not widely read , it received favorable notice from some of the critics . In 1835 appeared Paracelsus , in 1837 Strafford , in 1840 Sordello . From this time on , for the fifty remaining years of his life , his poetic activity hardly ceased , though his poetry was of uneven excellence . The middle period of his work , beginning with Bells and Pomegranates in 1842 , and ending with Balaustion 's Adventure ( a transcript of Euripides ’ Alcestis ) in 1871 , was by far the richest in poetic value .</p>
     <p>In 1846 he married Elizabeth Barrett , the poet . They left England for Italy , where , because of Mrs. Browning 's feeble health , they continued to reside until her death in 1861 . The remainder of his life was divided between England and Italy , with frequent visits to southern France . His reputation as a poet had steadily grown . He was now one of the best known men in England . His mental activity continued unabated to the end . Within the last thirty years of his life he wrote The Ring and the Book — his longest work , one of the longest and , intellectually , one of the greatest , of English poems ; translated the Agamemnon of Æschylus and the Alcestis of Euripides ; published many shorter poems ; kept up the studies which had always been his labor and his pastime ; and found leisure also to know a wide circle of men and women . William Sharp gives a pleasing picture of the last years of his life : “ Everybody wished him to come and dine ; and he did his utmost to gratify Everybody . He saw everything ; read all the notable books ; kept himself acquainted with the leading contents of the journals and magazines ; conducted a large correspondence ; read new French , German , and Italian books of mark ; read and translated Euripides and Æschylus : knew all the gossip of the literary clubs , salons , and the studios ; was a frequenter of afternoon tea-parties ; and then , over and above it , he was Browning : the most profoundly subtle mind that has exercised itself in poetry since Shakespeare . "[ 1 ]</p>
     <p>He died in Venice , on December 12 , 1889 , and was buried in the poet 's corner of Westminster Abbey .</p>

     <head>BROWNING AS POET</head>
     <p>The three generations of readers who have lived since Browning 's first publication have seen as many attitudes taken toward one of the ablest poetic spirits of the century . To the first he appeared an enigma , a writer hopelessly obscure , perhaps not even clear in his own mind , as to the message he wished to deliver ; to the second he appeared a prophet and a philosopher , full of all wisdom and subtlety , too deep for common mortals to fathom with line and plummet ,— concealing below green depths of ocean priceless gems of thought and feeling ; to the third , a poet full of inequalities in conception and expression , who has done many good things well and has made many grave failures .</p>
     <p>No poet in our generation has fared so ill at the hands of the critics . Already the Browning library is large . Some of the criticism is good ; much of it , regarding the author as philosopher and symbolist , is totally askew . Reams have been written in interpretation of Childe Roland , an imaginative fantasy composed in one day . Abstruse ideas have been wrested from the simple story of My Last Duchess . His poetry has been the stamping-ground of theologians and the centre of prattling literary circles . In this tortuous maze of futile criticism the one thing lost sight of is the fact that a poet must be judged by the standards of art . It must be confessed , however , that Browning is himself to blame for much of the smoke of commentary that has gathered round him . He has often chosen the oblique expression where the direct would serve better ; often interpolated his own musing subtleties between the reader and the life he would present ; often followed his theme into intricacies beyond his own power to resolve into the simple forms of art . Thus it has come about that misguided readers became enigma hunters , and the poet their Sphinx .</p>
     <p>The real question with Browning , as with any poet , is , What is his work and worth as an artist ? What of human life has he presented , and how clear and true are his presentations ? What passions , what struggles , what ideals , what activities of men has he added to the art world ? What beauty and dignity , what light , has he created ? How does he view life : with what of hope , or aspiration , or strength ? These questions may be discussed under his sense and mastery of form , and under his views of human life .</p>
     <p>Browning 's sense of form has often been attacked and defended . The first impression upon reading him is of harshness amounting to the grotesque . Rhymes often clash and jangle like the music of savages . Such rhymes as</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">“ Fancy the fabric ...</l>
       <l n="2">Ere mortar dab brick , ”</l>
     </lg>
     <p>strain dignity and beauty to the breaking-point . Archaic and bizarre words are pressed into service to help out the rhyme and metre ; instead of melodic rhythm there are harsh and jolting combinations ; until the reader brought up in the traditions of Shakespeare , Milton , and Tennyson , is fain to cry out , This is not poetry !</p>
     <p>In internal form , as well , Browning often defies the established laws of literature . Distorted and elliptical sentences , long and irrelevant parentheses , curious involutions of thought , and irregular or incoherent development of the narrative or the picture , often leave the reader in despair even of the meaning . Nor can these departures from orderly beauty always be defended by the exigencies of the subjects . They do not fit the theme . They are the discords of a musician who either has not mastered his instrument or is not sensitive to all the finer effects . Some of his work stands out clear from these faults : A Toccata of Galuppi 's , Love Among the Ruins , the Songs from Pippa Passes , Apparitions , Andrea del Sarto , and a score of others might be cited to show that Browning could write with a sense of form as true , and an ear as delicate , as could any poet of the century , except Tennyson .</p>
     <p>To Browning belongs the credit of having created a new poetic form ,— the dramatic monologue . In this form the larger number of his poems are cast . Among the best examples in this volume are My Last Duchess , The Bishop Orders his Tomb , The Laboratory , and Confessions . One person only is speaking , but reveals the presence , action , and thoughts of the others who are in the scene at the same time that he reveals his own character , as in a conversation in which but one voice is audible . The dramatic monologue has in a peculiar degree the advantages of compression and vividness , and is , in Browning 's hands , an instrument of great power .</p>
     <p>The charge of obscurity so often made against Browning 's poetry must in part be admitted . As has been said above he is often led off by his many-sided interests into irrelevancies and subtleties that interfere with simplicity and beauty . His compressed style and his fondness for unusual words often make an unwarranted demand upon the reader 's patience . Such passages are a challenge to his admirers and a repulse to the indifferent . Sometimes , indeed , the ore is not worth the smelting ; often it yields enough to reward the greatest patience .</p>
     <p>Browning , like all great poets , knew life widely and deeply through men and books . He was born in London , near the great centres of the intellectual movements of his time ; he travelled much , especially in Italy and France ; he read widely in the literatures and philosophies of many ages and many lands ; and so grew into the cosmopolitanism of spirit that belonged to Chaucer and to Shakespeare .</p>
     <p>In all art human life is the matter of ultimate interest . To Browning this was so in a peculiar degree . In the epistolary preface to Sordello , written thirty years after its first publication , he said : “ My stress lay on the incidents in the development of a soul : little else is worth study . ” This interest in “ the development of a soul ” is the keynote of nearly all his work . To it are directly traceable many of the most obvious excellences and defects of his poetry . He came to look below the surfaces of things for the soul beneath them . He came to be “ the subtlest assertor of the Soul in Song , ” and like his own pair of lovers on the Campagna , “ unashamed of soul . ” His early preference of Shelley to Keats indicated this bent . His readers are conscious always of revelations of the souls of the men and women he portrays ; the sweet and tender womanhood of the Duchess , the sordid and material soul of the old Bishop of St. Praxed 's , the devoted and heroic soul of Napoleon 's young soldier , the weary and despairing soul of Andrea del Sarto ,— and a host of others stand before us cleared of the veil of habit and convention . The souls of men appear as the victors over all material and immaterial obstacles . Human affection transforms the bare room to a bower of fruits and flowers ; human courage and resolution carry Childe Roland victoriously past the threats and terrors of malignant nature , and the despair from accumulated memories of failure ; death itself is described in Evelyn Hope , in Prospice , in Rabbi Ben Ezra , as a phase , a transit of the soul , wherein the material aspects and the physical terrors disappear . In Browning 's poetry , the one real and permanent thing is the world of ideas , the world of the spirit . He is in this one of the truest Platonists of modern times .</p>
     <p>To many young readers this method in art comes like a revelation . Other poets also portray the souls of men ; but Browning does it more obviously , more intentionally , more insistently . It is well , therefore , to have read Browning . To learn to read him aright is to enter the gateway to other good and great poetry .</p>
     <p>Out of this predominating interest in the souls of men , and out of his intense intellectual activity and scientific curiosity , grows one of Browning 's greatest defects . He is often led too far afield , into intricacies and anomalies of character beyond the range of common experience and sympathy . The criminal , the “ moral idiot , ” belong to the alienist rather than to the poet . The abnormalities of nature have no place in the world of great art ; they do not echo the common experience of mankind . Already the interest is decreasing in that part of his poetry which deals with such themes . Bishop Blougram and Mr. Sludge will not take place in the ranks of artistic creations . Nor can the poet 's “ special pleading ” for such types , however ingenious it may be , whatever philanthropy of soul it may imply , be regarded as justification . Sometimes , indeed , the poet is led by his sympathy and his intellectual ingenuity into defences that are inconsistent with his own standards of the true and the beautiful .</p>
     <p>The trait in Browning which appeals to the largest number of readers is his strenuous optimism . He will admit no evil or sorrow too great to be borne , too irrational to have some ultimate purpose of beneficence . “ There shall never be one lost good , ” says Abt Vogler . The suicides in the morgue only serve to call forth his declaration :—</p>
     <lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">“ My own hope is , a sun will pierce</l>
       <l n="2">The thickest cloud earth ever stretched ;</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="3">That what began best can n't end worst ,</l>
       <l n="4">Nor what God blessed once , prove accurst . ”</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>He has no fear of death ; he will face it gladly , in confidence of the life beyond . His Grammarian is content to assume an order of things which will justify in the next life his ceaseless toil in this , merely to learn how to live . Rabbi Ben Ezra 's old age is serene in the hope of the continuity of life and the eternal development of character ; he finds life good , and the plan of things perfect . In brief , Browning accepts life as it is , and believes it good , piecing out his conception of the goodness of life by drawing without limit upon his hopes of the other world . With the exception of a few poems like Andrea del Sarto , this is the unbroken tone of his poetry . Calvinism , asceticism , pessimism in any form , he rejects . He sustains his position not by argument , but by hope and assertion . It is a matter of temperament : he is optimistic because he was born so . Different from the serene optimism of Shakespeare 's later life , in The Tempest and The Winter 's Tale , in that it is not , like Shakespeare 's , born of long and deep suffering from the contemplation of the tragedies of human life , it bears , in that degree , less of solace and conviction .</p>
     <p>To Browning 's temperament , also , may be ascribed another prominent trait in his work . He steadily asserts the right of the individual to live out his own life , to be himself in fulfilling his desires and aspirations . The Statue and the Bust is the famous exposition of this doctrine . It is a teaching that neither the poet 's optimism nor his acumen has justified in the minds of men . It is a return to the unbridled freedom of nature advocated by Whitman and Rousseau ; an extreme assertion of the value of the individual man , and of unregulated democracy ; an outgrowth , it may be , of the robustness and originality of Browning 's nature , and interesting — not as a clew to his life , which conformed to that of organized society — but as a clew to his independence of classical and conventional forms in the exercise of his art .</p>
     <p>Creative energy Browning has in high degree . With the poet 's insight into character and motives , the poet 's grasp of the essential laws of human life , the poet 's vividness of imagination , he has portrayed a host of types distinct from each other , true to life , strongly marked and consistent . With fine dramatic instinct he has shown these characters in true relation to the facts of life and to each other . In this respect he has satisfied the most exigent demands of art , and has already taken rank as one of the great creative minds of the nineteenth century .</p>
     <lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">True poet he is , also , in his depth of feeling and range of sympathy .</l>
       <l n="2">Beneath a ruggedness of intellect , like his landscape in De</l>
       <l n="3">Gustibus , there is always sympathy and tenderness . It is , indeed ,</l>
       <l n="4">more like the serenity of Chaucer 's emotions than like the tragic</l>
       <l n="5">fervor of Shakespeare 's . Mrs. Browning 's estimate of him in Lady</l>

       <l n="7">“ Or from Browning some ‘ Pomegranate , ’ which , if cut deep down the middle ,</l>

      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="9">is true criticism .</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>His love of nature , and his sense of the joy and beauty of it , appear often in his poetry ; but not with the same insistence as in Wordsworth and Burns , and seldom with the same pervasiveness , or with the same beauty , as in Tennyson . He was rather the poet of men 's souls . When he does use nature , it is generally to illustrate some phase or experience of the soul , and not for the sake of its beauty . He has , however , some nature-descriptions so exquisite that English poetry would be the poorer for their loss . Witness De Gustibus , Up at a Villa , Home Thoughts from Abroad , Pippa 's Songs , and Saul .</p>
     <p>It is too early to guess at Browning 's permanent place in our literature . But his vigor of intellect , his insight into the human heart , his originality in phrase and conception , his unquenchable and fearless optimism , and his grasp of the problems of his century , make him beyond question one of its greatest figures .</p>

     <p>— WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR .</p>
     <p>Tennyson has a vivid feeling of the dignity and potency of law .... Browning vividly feels the importance , the greatness and beauty of passions and enthusiasms , and his imagination is comparatively unimpressed by the presence of law and its operations .... It is not the order and regularity in the processes of the natural world which chiefly delight Browning 's imagination , but the streaming forth of power , and will , and love from the whole face of the visible universe ....</p>
     <p>Tennyson considers the chief instruments of human progress to be a vast increase of knowledge and of political organization . Browning makes that progress dependent on the production of higher passions , and aspirations ,— hopes , and joys , and sorrows ; Tennyson finds the evidence of the truth of the doctrine of progress in the universal presence of a self-evolving law . Browning obtains his assurance of its truth from inward presages and prophecies of the soul , from anticipations , types , and symbols of a higher greatness in store for man , which even now reside within him , a creature ever unsatisfied , ever yearning upward in thought , feeling , and endeavour .</p>
     <p>... Hence , it is not obedience , it is not submission to the law of duty , which points out to us our true path of life , but rather infinite desire and endless aspiration . Browning 's ideal of manhood in this world always recognizes the fact that it is the ideal of a creature who never can be perfected on earth , a creature whom other and higher lives await in an endless hereafter ....</p>
     <p>The gleams of knowledge which we possess are of chief value because they “ sting with hunger for full light . ” The goal of knowledge , as of love , is God himself . Its most precious part is that which is least positive — those momentary intuitions of things which eye hath not seen nor ear heard . The needs of the highest parts of our humanity cannot be supplied by ascertained truth , in which we might rest , or which we might put to use for definite ends ; rather by ventures of faith , which test the courage of the soul , we ascend from surmise to assurance , and so again to higher surmise .— Condensed from EDWARD DOWDEN , Studies in Literature .</p>
     <p>... Browning has not cared for that poetic form which bestows perennial charm , or else he was incapable of it . He fails in beauty , in concentration of interest , in economy of language , in selection of the best from the common treasure of experience . In those works where he has been most indifferent , as in the Red Cotton Night-Cap Country , he has been merely whimsical and dull ; in those works where the genius he possessed is most felt , as in Saul , A Toccata of Galuppi 's , Rabbi Ben Ezra , The Flight of the Duchess , The Bishop Orders his Tomb in Saint Praxed 's Church , Hervé Riel , Cavalier Tunes , Time 's Revenges , and many more , he achieves beauty , or nobility , or fitness of phrase such as only a poet is capable of . It is in these last pieces and their like that his fame lies for the future . It was his lot to be strong as the thinker , the moralist , with “ the accomplishment of verse , ” the scholar interested to rebuild the past of experience , the teacher with an explicit dogma in an intellectual form with examples from life , the anatomist of human passions , instincts , and impulses in all their gamut , the commentator on his own age ; he was weak as the artist , often unnecessarily and by choice , in the repulsive form ,— in the awkward , the obscure , the ugly . He belongs with Jonson , with Dryden , with the heirs of the masculine intellect , the men of power not unvisited by grace , but in whom mind is predominant . Upon the work of such poets time hesitates , conscious of their mental greatness , but also of their imperfect art , their heterogeneous matter ; at last the good is sifted from that whence worth has departed .— From GEORGE EDWARD WOODBERRY 'S Studies in Letters and Life .</p>
     <p>When it is urged that for a poet the intellectual energies are too strong in Browning , that for poetry the play of intellectual interests and activities is too great in his work , and that Browning often and at times ruthlessly sacrifices the requirements and effects of art for the expression of thought , that “ though he refreshes the heart he tires the brain , ” we should admit this with regard to a good deal of the work of the third period . We should allow that this is the side to which he leans generally , but still hold that , though to many his intellectual quality and energy may well seem excessive , yet in great part of his work , and that of course , his best , the passion of the poet and his kind of imagination are just as fresh and powerful as the intellectual force and subtlety are keen and abundant .— JAMES FROTHINGHAM , Studies of the Mind and Art of Robert Browning .</p>

       <l n="1">Now dumb is he who waked the world to speak ,</l>
       <l n="2">And voiceless hangs the world beside his bier ,</l>
       <l n="3">Our words are sobs , our cry or praise a tear :</l>
       <l n="4">We are the smitten mortal , we the weak .</l>
       <l n="5">We see a spirit on earth 's loftiest peak</l>
       <l n="6">Shine , and wing hence the way he makes more clear :</l>
       <l n="7">See a great Tree of Life that never sere</l>
       <l n="8">Dropped leaf for aught that age or storms might wreak ;</l>
       <l n="9">Such ending is not death : such living shows</l>
       <l n="10">What wide illumination brightness sheds</l>
       <l n="11">From one big heart ,— to conquer man 's old foes :</l>
       <l n="12">The coward , and the tyrant , and the force</l>
       <l n="13">Of all those weedy monsters raising heads</l>
       <l n="14">When Song is muck from springs of turbid source .</l>

       <l n="13">Rebuckled the cheek-strap , chained slacker the bit ,</l>

       <l n="49">With his nostrils like pits full of blood to the brim ,</l>

       <l n="53">Stood up in the stirrup , leaned , patted his ear ,</l>
       <l n="54">Called my Roland his pet-name , my horse without peer ;</l>

       <l n="59">And no voice but was praising this Roland of mine ,</l>
       <l n="60">As I poured down his throat our last measure of wine ,</l>
       <l n="61">Which ( the burgesses voted by common consent )</l>

       <l n="6">I made , six days , a hiding-place</l>
       <l n="7">Of that dry green old aqueduct</l>
       <l n="8">Where I and Charles ,° when boys , have plucked ° 8</l>
       <l n="9">The fire-flies from the roof above ,</l>
       <l n="10">Bright creeping thro ’ the moss they love : 10</l>

       <l n="14">And when that peril ceased at night ,</l>
       <l n="15">The sky broke out in red dismay</l>
       <l n="16">With signal-fires . Well , there I lay</l>
       <l n="17">Close covered o'er in my recess ,</l>
       <l n="18">Up to the neck in ferns and cress .</l>
       <l n="19">Thinking on Metternich ,° our friend , ° 19</l>
       <l n="20">And Charles 's miserable end , 20</l>

       <l n="22">Hunger o'ercame me when I heard</l>
       <l n="23">The peasants from the village go</l>
       <l n="24">To work among the maize : you know ,</l>
       <l n="25">With us in Lombardy ,° they bring ° 25</l>
       <l n="26">Provisions packed on mules , a string ,</l>

       <l n="28">And casks , and boughs on every cask</l>
       <l n="29">To keep the sun 's heat from the wine ;</l>
       <l n="30">These I let pass in jingling line ; 30</l>
       <l n="31">And , close on them , dear noisy crew ,</l>
       <l n="32">The peasants from the village , too ;</l>
       <l n="33">For at the very rear would troop</l>
       <l n="34">Their wives and sisters in a group</l>
       <l n="35">To help , I knew . When these had passed ,</l>
       <l n="36">I threw my glove to strike the last ,</l>
       <l n="37">Taking the chance : she did not start ,</l>
       <l n="38">Much less cry out , but stooped apart ,</l>
       <l n="39">One instant rapidly glanced round ,</l>
       <l n="40">And saw me beckon from the ground . 40</l>
       <l n="41">A wild bush grows and hides my crypt ;</l>
       <l n="42">She picked my glove up while she stripped</l>
       <l n="43">A branch off , then rejoined the rest</l>
       <l n="44">With that ; my glove lay in her breast :</l>
       <l n="45">Then I drew breath ; they disappeared :</l>
       <l n="46">It was for Italy I feared .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="47">An hour , and she returned alone</l>
       <l n="48">Exactly where my glove was thrown .</l>
       <l n="49">Meanwhile came many thoughts : on me</l>
       <l n="50">Rested the hopes of Italy . 50</l>
       <l n="51">I had devised a certain tale</l>
       <l n="52">Which , when ‘ twas told her , could not fail</l>
       <l n="53">Persuade a peasant of its truth ;</l>
       <l n="54">I meant to call a freak of youth</l>
       <l n="55">This hiding , and give hopes of pay ,</l>
       <l n="56">And no temptation to betray .</l>
       <l n="57">But when I saw that woman 's face ,</l>
       <l n="58">Its calm simplicity of grace ,</l>
       <l n="59">Our Italy 's own attitude</l>
       <l n="60">In which she walked thus far , and stood , 60</l>
       <l n="61">Planting each naked foot so firm ,</l>
       <l n="62">To crush the snake and spare the worm —</l>
       <l n="63">At first sight of her eyes , I said ,</l>
       <l n="64">“ I am that man upon whose head</l>
       <l n="65">They fix the price , because I hate</l>
       <l n="66">The Austrians over us ; the State</l>

       <l n="69">And be your death , for aught I know ,</l>
       <l n="70">If once they find you saved their foe . 70</l>
       <l n="71">Now , you must bring me food and drink ,</l>
       <l n="72">And also paper , pen and ink ,</l>
       <l n="73">And carry safe what I shall write</l>
       <l n="74">To Padua , which you 'll reach at night</l>
       <l n="75">Before the duomo shuts ; go in ,</l>
       <l n="76">And wait till Tenebrae ° begin ; ° 76</l>
       <l n="77">Walk to the third confessional ,</l>
       <l n="78">Between the pillar and the wall ,</l>
       <l n="79">And kneeling whisper , Whence comes peace ?</l>
       <l n="80">Say it a second time , then cease ; 80</l>

       <l n="3">That piece a wonder , now : Frà Pandolf 's ° hands ° 3</l>
       <l n="4">Worked busily a day , and there she stands .</l>
       <l n="5">Will't please you sit and look at her ? I said</l>
       <l n="6">“ Frà Pandolf ” by design : for never read</l>
       <l n="7">Strangers like you that pictured countenance ,</l>
       <l n="8">The depth and passion of its earnest glance ,</l>
       <l n="9">But to myself they turned ( since none puts by</l>
       <l n="10">The curtain I have drawn for you , but I ) 10</l>
       <l n="11">And seemed as they would ask me , if they durst ,</l>
       <l n="12">How such a glance came there ; so , not the first</l>
       <l n="13">Are you to turn and ask thus . Sir , ‘ twas not</l>
       <l n="14">Her husband 's presence only , called that spot</l>
       <l n="15">Of joy into the Duchess ’ cheek : perhaps</l>
       <l n="16">Frà Pandolf chanced to say “ Her mantle laps</l>
       <l n="17">Over my lady 's wrist too much , ” or “ Paint</l>
       <l n="18">Must never hope to reproduce the faint</l>
       <l n="19">Half-flush that dies along her throat : ” such stuff</l>
       <l n="20">Was courtesy , she thought , and cause enough 20</l>
       <l n="21">For calling up that spot of joy . She had</l>
       <l n="22">A heart — how shall I say ?— too soon made glad ,</l>
       <l n="23">Too easily impressed ; she liked whate'er</l>
       <l n="24">She looked on , and her looks went everywhere .</l>
       <l n="25">Sir , ‘ twas all one ! My favour at her breast ,</l>
       <l n="26">The dropping of the daylight in the West ,</l>
       <l n="27">The bough of cherries some officious fool</l>
       <l n="28">Broke in the orchard for her , the white mule</l>
       <l n="29">She rode with round the terrace — all and each</l>
       <l n="30">Would draw from her alike the approving speech , 30</l>
       <l n="31">Or blush , at least . She thanked men ,— good ! but thanked</l>
       <l n="32">Somehow — I know not how — as if she ranked</l>
       <l n="33">My gift of a nine-hundred-years-old name</l>
       <l n="34">With anybody 's gift . Who 'd stoop to blame</l>
       <l n="35">This sort of trifling ? Even had you skill</l>
       <l n="36">In speech — ( which I have not ) — to make your will</l>
       <l n="37">Quite clear to such an one , and say , “ Just this</l>
       <l n="38">Or that in you disgusts me ; here you miss ,</l>
       <l n="39">Or there exceed the mark ” — and if she let</l>
       <l n="40">Herself be lessoned so , nor plainly set 40</l>
       <l n="41">Her wits to yours , forsooth , and made excuse ,</l>
       <l n="42">— E'en then would be some stooping : and I choose</l>
       <l n="43">Never to stoop . Oh , sir , she smiled , no doubt ,</l>
       <l n="44">Whene'er I passed her ; but who passed without</l>
       <l n="45">Much the same smile ? This grew ; I gave commands ;</l>
       <l n="46">Then all smiles stopped together .° There she stands ° 46</l>
       <l n="47">As if alive . Will't please you rise ? We 'll meet</l>
       <l n="48">The company below , then . I repeat ,</l>
       <l n="49">The Count your master 's known munificence</l>
       <l n="50">Is ample warrant that no just pretence 50</l>
       <l n="51">Of mine for dowry will be disallowed ;</l>
       <l n="52">Though his fair daughter 's self , as I avowed</l>
       <l n="53">At starting , is my object . Nay , we 'll go</l>
       <l n="54">Together down , sir . Notice Neptune , though ,</l>
       <l n="55">Taming a sea-horse , thought a rarity ,</l>
       <l n="56">Which Claus of Innsbruck ° cast in bronze for me ! ° 56</l>

      <head>THE BISHOP ORDERS HIS TOMB AT SAINT PRAXED 'S CHURCH</head>
      <head>ROME , 15 —</head>
       <l n="1">Vanity , saith the preacher , vanity !</l>
       <l n="2">Draw round my bed : is Anselm keeping back ?</l>
       <l n="3">Nephews — sons mine ... ah God , I know not ! Well ,</l>
       <l n="4">She , men would have to be your mother once ,</l>
       <l n="5">Old Gandolf ° envied me , so fair she was ! ° 5</l>
       <l n="6">What 's done is done , and she is dead beside ,</l>
       <l n="7">Dead long ago , and I am Bishop since .</l>
       <l n="8">And as she died so must we die ourselves ,</l>
       <l n="9">And thence ye may perceive the world 's a dream .</l>
       <l n="10">Life , how and what is it ? As here I lie 10</l>
       <l n="11">In this state-chamber , dying by degrees ,</l>
       <l n="12">Hours and long hours in the dead night , I ask</l>
       <l n="13">“ Do I live , am I dead ? ” Peace , peace seems all .</l>
       <l n="14">Saint Praxed 's ever was the church for peace ;</l>
       <l n="15">And so , about this tomb of mine . I fought</l>
       <l n="16">With tooth and nail to save my niche , ye know :</l>
       <l n="17">— Old Gandolf cozened me , despite my care ;</l>
       <l n="18">Shrewd was that snatch from out the corner South</l>
       <l n="19">He graced his carrion with , God curse the same !</l>
       <l n="20">Yet still my niche is not so cramped but thence 20</l>
       <l n="21">One sees the pulpit o ’ the epistle-side ,</l>
       <l n="22">And somewhat of the choir , those silent seats ,</l>
       <l n="23">And up into the aery dome where live</l>
       <l n="24">The angels , and a sunbeam 's sure to lurk :</l>
       <l n="25">And I shall fill my slab of basalt there ,</l>
       <l n="26">And ‘ neath my tabernacle take my rest ,</l>
       <l n="27">With those nine columns round me , two and two ,</l>
       <l n="28">The odd one at my feet where Anselm stands :</l>
       <l n="29">Peach-blossom marble all , the rare , the ripe</l>
       <l n="30">As fresh-poured red wine of a mighty pulse , 30</l>
       <l n="31">— Old Gandolf with his paltry onion-stone ,° ° 31</l>
       <l n="32">Put me where I may look at him ! True peach ,</l>
       <l n="33">Rosy and flawless : how I earned the prize !</l>
       <l n="34">Draw close : that conflagration of my church</l>
       <l n="35">— What then ? So much was saved if aught were missed !</l>
       <l n="36">My sons , ye would not be my death ? Go dig</l>
       <l n="37">The white-grape vineyard where the oil-press stood ,</l>
       <l n="38">Drop water gently till the surface sink ,</l>
       <l n="39">And if ye find ... Ah God , I know not , I !...</l>
       <l n="40">Bedded in store of rotten fig-leaves soft , 40</l>
       <l n="41">And corded up in a tight olive-frail ,° ° 41</l>
       <l n="42">Some lump , ah God , of lapis lazuli ,° ° 42</l>
       <l n="43">Big as a Jew 's head cut off at the nape ,</l>
       <l n="44">Blue as a vein o'er the Madonna 's breast ...</l>
       <l n="45">Sons , all have I bequeathed you , villas , all ,</l>
       <l n="46">That brave Frascati ° villa , with its bath , ° 46</l>
       <l n="47">So , let the blue lump poise between my knees ,</l>
       <l n="48">Like God the Father 's globe on both his hands</l>
       <l n="49">Ye worship in the Jesu Church , so gay ,</l>
       <l n="50">For Gandolf shall not choose but see and burst ! 50</l>
       <l n="51">Swift as a weaver 's shuttle fleet our years :</l>
       <l n="52">Man goeth to the grave , and where is he ?</l>
       <l n="53">Did I say , basalt for my slab , sons ? Black —</l>
       <l n="54">‘ Twas ever antique-black I meant ! How else</l>

       <l n="56">The bas-relief in bronze ye promised me ,</l>
       <l n="57">Those Pans and Nymphs ye wot of , and perchance</l>
       <l n="58">Some tripod , thyrsus , with a vase or so ,</l>
       <l n="59">The Saviour at his sermon on the mount ,</l>
       <l n="60">Saint Praxed in a glory , and one Pan 60</l>
       <l n="61">Ready to twitch the Nymph 's last garment off ,</l>
       <l n="62">And Moses with the tables ° ... but I know ° 62</l>
       <l n="63">Ye mark me not ! What do they whisper thee ,</l>
       <l n="64">Child of my bowels , Anselm ? Ah , ye hope</l>
       <l n="65">To revel down my villas while I gasp</l>
       <l n="66">Bricked o'er with beggar 's mouldy travertine</l>
       <l n="67">Which Gandolf from his tomb-top chuckles at !</l>
       <l n="68">Nay , boys , ye love me — all of jasper , then !</l>
       <l n="69">‘ Tis jasper ye stand pledged to , lest I grieve</l>
       <l n="70">My bath must needs be left behind , alas ! 70</l>
       <l n="71">One block , pure green as a pistachio-nut ,</l>
       <l n="72">There 's plenty jasper somewhere in the world —</l>
       <l n="73">And have I not Saint Praxed 's ear to pray</l>
       <l n="74">Horses for ye , and brown Greek manuscripts ,</l>
       <l n="75">And mistresses with great smooth marbly limbs ?</l>
       <l n="76">— That 's if ye carve my epitaph aright ,</l>
       <l n="77">Choice Latin , picked phrase , Tully 's ° every word , ° 77</l>
       <l n="78">No gaudy ware like Gandolf 's second line —</l>
       <l n="79">Tully , my masters ? Ulpian ° serves his need ! ° 79</l>
       <l n="80">And then how I shall lie thro ’ centuries , 80</l>
       <l n="81">And hear the blessed mutter of the mass ,</l>
       <l n="82">And see God made and eaten all day long ,</l>

       <l n="100">No Tully , said I , Ulpian at the best ! 100</l>
       <l n="101">Evil and brief hath been my pilgrimage .</l>
       <l n="102">All lapis , all , sons ! Else I give the Pope</l>
       <l n="103">My villas ! Will ye ever eat my heart ?</l>
       <l n="104">Ever your eyes were as a lizard 's quick ,</l>
       <l n="105">They glitter like your mother 's for my soul .</l>
       <l n="106">Or ye would heighten my impoverished frieze ,</l>
       <l n="107">Piece out its starved design , and fill my vase</l>
       <l n="108">With grapes , and add a visor and a Term ,</l>
       <l n="109">And to the tripod ye would tie a lynx</l>
       <l n="110">That in his struggle throws the thyrsus down , 110</l>
       <l n="111">To comfort me on my entablature</l>
       <l n="112">Whereon I am to lie till I must ask</l>
       <l n="113">“ Do I live , am I dead ? ” There , leave me , there !</l>
       <l n="114">For ye have stabbed me with ingratitude</l>
       <l n="115">To death — ye wish it — God , ye wish it ! stone —</l>
       <l n="116">Gritstone , a-crumble ! clammy squares which sweat</l>
       <l n="117">As if the corpse they keep were oozing through —</l>
       <l n="118">And no more lapis to delight the world !</l>
       <l n="119">Well , go ! I bless ye . Fewer tapers there ,</l>
       <l n="120">But in a row : and , going , turn your backs 120</l>
       <l n="121">— Ay , like departing altar-ministrants ,</l>
       <l n="122">And leave me in my church , the church for peace ,</l>
       <l n="123">That I may watch , at leisure if he leers —</l>
       <l n="124">Old Gandolf — at me , from his onion-stone ,</l>

       <l n="12">This evening more than usual : and it seems</l>
       <l n="13">As if — forgive now — should you let me sit</l>
       <l n="14">Here by the window , with your hand in mine ,</l>
       <l n="15">And look a half-hour forth on Fiesole ,° ° 15</l>

       <l n="21">Your soft hand is a woman of itself ,</l>
       <l n="22">And mine the man 's bared breast she curls inside .</l>
       <l n="23">Do n't count the time lost , neither ; you must serve</l>
       <l n="24">For each of the five pictures we require :</l>
       <l n="25">It saves a model . So ! keep looking so —</l>
       <l n="26">My serpentining beauty , rounds on rounds !</l>
       <l n="27">— How could you ever prick those perfect ears ,</l>

       <l n="30">Which everybody looks on and calls his , 30</l>
       <l n="31">And , I suppose , is looked on by in turn ,</l>
       <l n="32">While she looks — no one 's : very dear , no less .</l>
       <l n="33">You smile ? why , there 's my picture ready made ,</l>
       <l n="34">There 's what we painters call our harmony !</l>
       <l n="35">A common grayness silvers everything ,—</l>
       <l n="36">All in a twilight , you and I alike</l>
       <l n="37">— You , at the point of your first pride in me</l>
       <l n="38">( That 's gone , you know ) — but I , at every point ;</l>
       <l n="39">My youth , my hope , my art , being all toned down</l>
       <l n="40">To yonder sober pleasant Fiesole . 40</l>
       <l n="41">There 's the bell clinking from the chapel-top ;</l>
       <l n="42">That length of convent-wall across the way</l>
       <l n="43">Holds the trees safer , huddled more inside ;</l>
       <l n="44">The last monk leaves the garden ; days decrease ,</l>
       <l n="45">And autumn grows , autumn in everything .</l>
       <l n="46">Eh ? the whole seems to fall into a shape ,</l>
       <l n="47">As if I saw alike my work and self</l>
       <l n="48">And all that I was born to be and do ,</l>
       <l n="49">A twilight-piece . Love , we are in God 's hand .</l>
       <l n="50">How strange now , looks the life he makes us lead ; 50</l>
       <l n="51">So free we seem , so fettered fast we are !</l>
       <l n="52">I feel he laid the fetter : let it lie !</l>
       <l n="53">This chamber for example — turn your head —</l>
       <l n="54">All that 's behind us ! You do n't understand</l>

       <l n="61">What I see , what at bottom of my heart</l>
       <l n="62">I wish for , if I ever wish so deep —</l>
       <l n="63">Do easily , too — when I say , perfectly ,</l>

       <l n="65">Who listened to the Legate 's talk last week ;</l>
       <l n="66">And just as much they used to say in France .</l>
       <l n="67">At any rate ‘ tis easy , all of it !</l>
       <l n="68">No sketches first , no studies , that 's long past :</l>
       <l n="69">I do what many dream of , all their lives ,</l>
       <l n="70">— Dream ? strive to do , and agonize to do , 70</l>
       <l n="71">And fail in doing . I could count twenty such</l>
       <l n="72">On twice your fingers , and not leave this town ,</l>
       <l n="73">Who strive — you do n't know how the others strive</l>
       <l n="74">To paint a little thing like that you smeared</l>
       <l n="75">Carelessly passing with your robes afloat ,—</l>
       <l n="76">Yet do much less , so much less . Someone says ,</l>
       <l n="77">( I know his name , no matter ) — so much less !</l>
       <l n="78">Well , less is more , Lucrezia : I am judged .</l>
       <l n="79">There burns a truer light of God in them ,</l>
       <l n="80">In their vexed beating stuffed and stopped-up brain , 80</l>
       <l n="81">Heart , or whate'er else , than goes on to prompt</l>
       <l n="82">This low-pulsed forthright craftsman 's hand of mine .</l>
       <l n="83">Their works drop groundward , but themselves , I know ,</l>
       <l n="84">Reach many a time a heaven that 's shut to me ,</l>
       <l n="85">Enter and take their place there sure enough ,</l>
       <l n="86">Tho ’ they come back and cannot tell the world .</l>
       <l n="87">My works are nearer heaven , but I sit here .</l>
       <l n="88">The sudden blood of these men ! at a word —</l>
       <l n="89">Praise them , it boils , or blame them , it boils too .</l>
       <l n="90">I , painting from myself and to myself , 90</l>
       <l n="91">Know what I do , am unmoved by men 's blame</l>
       <l n="92">Or their praise either . Somebody remarks</l>
       <l n="93">Morello 's outline there is wrongly traced ,</l>
       <l n="94">His hue mistaken ; what of that ? or else ,</l>
       <l n="95">Rightly traced and well ordered ; what of that ?</l>
       <l n="96">Speak as they please , what does the mountain care ?</l>
       <l n="97">Ah , but a man 's reach should exceed his grasp ,</l>
       <l n="98">Or what 's a heaven for ? All is silver-gray ,</l>
       <l n="99">Placid and perfect with my art : the worse !</l>
       <l n="100">I know both what I want and what might gain , 100</l>
       <l n="101">And yet how profitless to know , to sigh</l>
       <l n="102">“ Had I been two , another and myself ,</l>

        <l n="337">E'en the serpent that slid away silent — he felt the new law .</l>
        <l n="338">The same stared in the white humid faces upturned by the flowers ;</l>
        <l n="339">The same worked in the heart of the cedar and moved the vine-bowers ;</l>
        <l n="340">And the little brooks witnessing murmured , persistent and low .</l>

     <p>The eldest son of William Macready , the actor , was confined to the house by illness , and Browning wrote this jeu d'esprit to amuse the boy and to give him a subject for illustrative drawings .</p>

      <head>HOW THEY BROUGHT THE GOOD NEWS FROM GHENT TO AIX . ( PAGE 19 . )</head>
      <head>Browning thus explains the origin of the poem : “ There is no sort of historical foundation about Good News from Ghent . I wrote it under the bulwark of a vessel off the African coast , after I had been at sea long enough to appreciate even the fancy of a gallop on the back of a certain good horse ‘ York , ’ then in my stable , at home . ” It would require a skilful imagination to create a set of circumstances which could give any other plausible reason for the ride to “ save Aix from her fate . ”</head>

     <p>Note the rapidity of narration and the galloping movement of the verse ; the time of starting , and the anxious attention to the time as the journey proceeds . How are we given a sense of the effort and distress of the horses ? How do we see Roland gradually emerging as the hero ? Where is the climax of the story ?

      <head>The cause of James II ., who had been removed from the English throne in 1688 , and succeeded by William and Mary , was taken up by the French . The story is strictly historical , except that Hervé Riel asked a holiday for the rest of his life .</head>

     </lg>
     <p>This dainty love lyric is said to have been written with Mrs. Browning in mind . It needs , however , no such narrow application for its interpretation . It is the simple declaration of the lover that the loved one reveals to him qualities of soul not revealed to others . Observe the “ order of lyric progress ” in speaking first of nature , then of the feelings .</p>
     <p>EVELYN HOPE . ( PAGE 41 . )</p>
     <p>The lover denies the evanescence of human love . He implies that in some future time the love will reappear and be rewarded . Browning 's optimism lays hold sometimes of the present , sometimes of the future , for the fulfilment of its hope . Especially strong is his “ sense of the continuity of life . ” “ There shall never be one lost good , ” he makes Abt Vogler say . The charm of this poem is more , perhaps , in its tenderness of tone and purity of atmosphere than in its doctrine of optimism .</p>
     <p>LOVE AMONG THE RUINS . ( PAGE 43 . )</p>
     <p>This poem was written in Rome in the winter of 1853-1854 . The scene is the Roman Campagna . The verse has a softness and a melody unusual in Browning . Compare its structure with that of Holmes 's The Last Leaf . Note the elements of pastoral peace and gentleness in the opening , and in the coloring of the scene . What two scenes are brought into contrast ? Note how the scenes alternate throughout the poem , and how each scene is gradually developed according to the ordinary laws of description . What ideals are thus compared ? What does the poem mean ?</p>

     </lg>
     <p>The lyric order appears sharply developed here in the parallelism of the two stanzas . Point out this parallelism of idea . Does it fail at any point ? Note the chivalrous absence of reproach by the lover . Observe the climax up to which each stanza leads , and the climax within the last line of each stanza .</p>

     </lg>
     <p>The poem celebrates the transforming and life-giving power of affection . Note the abrupt and excited manner of utterance , and how the speaker begins in the midst of things . He has already told his story once , when the poem opens . Note also the parallelism of structure , as in Misconceptions , the climax in each stanza , and the echo in the last line of each . Tell the story in the common order of prose narrative .</p>

     <p>First construct the scene of the poem . What has the priest said ? What is the sick man 's answer ? What evidence is there that his imagination is struggling to recall the old memory ?

     <p>The poem is half-humorous , half-serious . The speaker , in her imaginary conversation , gives her own history and that of the man she thinks she might have loved . The story is on the “ Maud Muller ” motive , but with less of sentimentality . The setting suggests the life of art students in Paris , or in some Italian city . The poem is a plea for the freedom of the individuality of a soul against the restrictions imposed by conventional standards of value . Its touches of humor , of human nature , and its summary of two lives in brief , are admirably done . Its rhymes sometimes need the indulgence accorded to humorous writing .</p>

      <head>This little poem , published in 1890 , is one of the good examples of a love lyric written by an old man whose spirit is still youthful . There are some similar things by Tennyson , in Gareth and Lynette , and elsewhere in his later publications .</head>

     <p>SONGS FROM PIPPA PASSES . ( PAGE 73 . )</p>
     <p>The drama of Pippa Passes is a succession of scenes , each representing some crisis of human life , into which breaks , with beneficent influence , a song of the girl Felippa , or “ Pippa , ” on her holiday from the silk-mills . She is unconscious of the influence she exerts . William Sharp says these songs “ are as pathetically fresh and free as a thrush 's song in a beleaguered city , and with the same unconsidered magic . ”</p>
     <p>THE LOST LEADER . ( PAGE 75 . )</p>
     <p>The desertion of the liberal cause by Wordsworth , Southey , and others , is the germinal idea of this poem . But Browning always strenuously insisted that the resemblance went no further ; that The Lost Leader is no true portrait of Wordsworth , though he became poet-laureate . The Lost Leader is a purely ideal conception , developed by the process of idealization from an individual who serves as a “ lay figure . ”</p>

      <head>INSTANS TYRANNUS . ( PAGE 82 . )</head>
      <head>=" Instans Tyrannus "=, the threatening tyrant . The phrase is from Horace 's Odes , Book III ., iii ., as is probably the idea of the poem . Gladstone translates the passage :—</head>

     <p>MEMORABILIA . ( PAGE 91 . )</p>
     <p>In Browning 's early youth , while he was under the influence of Byron and Pope , he found , at a bookstall , a stray copy of Shelley 's Dæmon of the World . From this time on , Shelley 's poetry was his ideal . The term “ moulted feather ” has peculiar significance from the fact that this was a poem which Shelley afterwards rejected .</p>
     <p>How is childlike wonder expressed in the first two stanzas ? How is the difference between the speaker and his friend indicated ? Why does the name of Shelley mean so much more to one than to the other ? In the figure that follows , what do the moor and the eagle 's feather stand for ?</p>

His son read him a telegram from the publishers , telling how great the demand was , and how favorable were the advance articles in the leading papers .

      <head>MY LAST DUCHESS . ( PAGE 105 . )</head>
      <head>Ferrara still preserves the mediæval traditions and appearance in a marked degree . The Dukes of Ferrara were noted art patrons . Both Ariosto and Tasso were members of their household ; but neither poet was fully appreciated by his master .</head>
       <l n="1">8 . = Fra Pandolf =. An imaginary artist .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>45-46 . Professor Corson , in his Introduction to Browning , quotes an answer from the poet himself : “ ‘ Yes , I meant that the commands were that she should be put to death . ’ And then , after a pause , he added , with a characteristic dash of expression , as if the thought had just started in his mind , ‘ Or he might have had her shut up in a convent . ’ ”</p>
     <p>56 . = Claus of Innsbruck =. An imaginary artist .</p>
     <p>This poem is a fine example of Browning 's skill in the use of dramatic monologue . ( See Introduction . ) The Duke is skilfully made to reveal his own character and motives , and those of the Duchess , and at the same time to indicate the actions of himself and his listener .</p>
     <p>Construct in imagination the scene and the action of the poem . What has brought the Duke and the envoy together ? What things indicate the Duke 's pride ? Was his jealousy due to pride or to affection ? Does he prize the picture as a work of art or as a memory of the Duchess ? What faults did he find in her ? What character do these criticisms show her to have had ? What did he wish her to he ? Note the anti-climax in lines 25-28 : what is the effect ? What shows the Duke 's difficulty in breaking his reserve on this matter ? What motive has he for so doing ? Where does the poet show skill in condensation , in character drawing , in vividness , in enlisting the reader 's sympathy ?</p>
     <p>The Flight of the Duchess should be read as a development and variation of this theme .</p>
     <p>THE BISHOP ORDERS HIS TOMB AT SAINT PRAXED 'S . ( PAGE 107 . )</p>
     <p>Ruskin gives this poem high praise : “ Robert Browning is unerring in every sentence he writes of the Middle Ages .... I know no other piece of modern English prose or poetry in which there is so much told , as in these lines , of the Renaissance spirit — its worldliness , inconsistency , pride , hypocrisy , ignorance of itself , love of art , of luxury , and of good Latin . It is nearly all that I have said of the central Renaissance , in thirty pages of The Stones of Venice , put into as many lines ; Browning 's also being the antecedent work . ”</p>
     <p>It is not , however , for its historical accuracy that a poem is mainly to be judged . The full and imaginative portrayal of a type , belonging not to one age only , but to human nature , is a greater achievement . And this achievement Browning has undoubtedly performed .</p>

      <head>ABT VOGLER . ( PAGE 126 . )</head>
      <head>George Joseph Vogler , known also as Abbé ( or Abt ) Vogler ( 1748-1816 ) , was a German musician . He composed operas and other musical pieces , became famous as an organist , and invented an organ with pedals and several keyboards . Browning seems to have in mind the complex musical harmonies of which the instrument was capable . See lines 10 , 13 , 52 , 55 , and 84 of the poem . See also the Encyclopædia Britannica .</head>

     <p>19 . = rampired =. Furnished with ramparts .</p>
     <p>23 . The reference is to St. Peter 's in Rome .</p>
     <p>The musician 's imagination takes fire from his playing , and his music seems like a glorious palace which he is building . The notes are conceived as spirits doing his bidding ( stanzas i-iii ) . As he proceeds the images change , and heaven and earth seem to unite with him in his creative activity : light flashes forth , and heaven and earth draw nearer together . Now he sees the past , the beginnings of things , and the future ; even the dead are back again in his presence . His imagination has anulled time and space . As he thinks of his art , it seems more glorious to him than painting and poetry : these work by laws that can be explained and followed , while music is a direct expression of the will , an act of higher creative power .</p>
     <p>When the music ends he cannot be consoled by the thought that as good music will come again . So he turns to the one unchanging thing , “ the ineffable Name . ” Thus he gains confidence to say , “ there shall never be one lost good . ” All failure and all evil are but a prelude to the good that shall in the end prevail . So he returns in hope and patience to the C major , the common chord of life .</p>
     <p>ART VOGLER is famous , not only for its confident optimism , but as an example of Browning 's power of annexing a new domain — that of music — to poetry .</p>
     <p>Where does the musician cease to speak of Solomon 's building and begin to describe his own ? Note , in stanza ii , how he speaks first of the “ keys , ” and afterwards has in mind the notes ; how he speaks of the bass notes as the foundation , and the upper notes as the structure . Where is the climax of his creative vision ? What does he mean in line 40 ? Is he right in saying music is less subject to laws than poetry and painting ? Why is he sad when his music ceases ? Why does he turn to God for consolation ? Follow carefully the argument in stanza ix . Is it convincing ? What analogy does he find between music , and good and evil ?</p>

      <head>A GRAMMARIAN 'S FUNERAL . ( PAGE 143 . )</head>
      <head>The Grammarian is a type of the early scholars who gave to Europe the treasures of Greek thought by translating the manuscripts recovered after the fall of Constantinople . The time is therefore the Renaissance , the latter part of the fifteenth century , and the place probably Italy .

What was his work ? What was his aim ? What is the value of such work ( 1 ) in presenting an ideal of life , ( 2 ) in the history of culture ? What circumstances in his life enhance his praise ? Did he make any mistake ? Does Browning think so ? How does Browning defend him ? What imagery in the poem seems especially effective ? Are you reminded of anything in “ Rabbi Ben Ezra ” ?

      <head>ANDREA DEL SARTO . ( PAGE 149 . )</head>
      <head>An Italian painter , of the Florentine school ; born 1487 , died 1531 . His merits and defects as an artist are given in the poem . The crime to which he is here made to refer was the use , for building himself a house , of the money intrusted to him by the French king for the purchase of works of art .

     <p>Construct the scene and action of the poem . How does the coloring harmonize with the artist 's mood ? Why is he weary ? How does he think of his art : what merit has it ? What does it lack ? How does he explain this lack ? What clew to it does his life afford ? Is his art soulless because he has done wrong ? Or , do the lack of soul in his painting , and the wrongdoing , and the infatuation with Lucrezia 's beauty , all arise from the same thing ,— the man 's own nature ? Does he appeal to your sympathy , or provoke your condemnation ? Does he blame himself , or another , or circumstances ?</p>

     <p>268-269 . Karshish , still unconvinced by the story of Lazarus , naturally regards it as irreverent .</p>
     <p>304-311 . This comes to Karshish as an afterthought , a corollary to the idea in the body of the poem .</p>
     <p>How is the general style of the verse-letter maintained ? What is Karshish 's mission in Judea ? How does he show his devotion to his art ? Point out instances of local color . Are they in harmony with the main current of the poem , or do they detract from the interest in the story ? Why does Karshish work up to his story so diffidently ? Why has the incident taken such hold upon him ? What do you conceive to be his character and worth as a man ?</p>
     <p>What of Lazarus ? What change has been wrought in him ? Is he in any way unfitted for this life ? To what does Karshish compare him , with his sudden wealth of insight behind the veil of the next world ? Which of the two men is better fitted for the condition in which he is placed ? What religious significance does the story of Lazarus come to have to Karshish ? What parallel ideas do you find in Rabbi Ben Ezra and in this poem ? Compare George Eliot 's story , The Lifted Veil .</p>
     <p>SAUL . ( PAGE 196 . )</p>
     <p>This is generally regarded as one of Browning 's greatest poems . Even his detractors concede to it beauty of form , fervor of feeling , and richness of imagery . The incident upon which it is based is found in 1 Samuel , chapter xvi . Saul is in the depths of mental eclipse , and David has been summoned to cure him by music . The young shepherd sings to him first the songs that appeal to the gentle animals ; then the songs that men use in their human relationships ,— songs of labor , of the wedding-feast , of the burial-service , of worship ; then he sings the joy of physical life , ending in an appeal to the ambition of King Saul . Saul is roused , but not yet brought to will to live . So David sings anew of the life of the spirit , the spirit of Saul living for his people . Then a touch of tenderness from the king flashes into David a prophetic insight : If he , the imperfect , would do so much for love of Saul , what would God , the all-perfect , do for men ? And so he reaches the conception of the Christ , the incarnation .</p>
     <p>The poem is full of echoes of the Old Testament , fused with the spirit of modern Christianity and modern thinking . It is touched here and there with bits of beauty from Oriental landscape . The long , even swell of the lines carries one along with no sense of the roughness so common in Browning 's verse . Rising by steady degrees to the climax , we feel , like David , some sense of the “ terrible glory , ” some sense of the unseen presences that hovered around him as he made his way home in the night .</p>
     <p>ONE WORD MORE . ( PAGE 224 ) .</p>
     <p>One Word More was appended to Browning 's volume Men and Women ( 1855 ) , by way of dedication of the book to his wife . It is characteristic of its author in its reality of feeling , in its seeking an unusual point of view , in its parenthetic and allusive style , and its occasional high felicity of expression . Those who feel overpowered by Browning 's vigor and profundity of thought , might stop here to note the exquisite inconsistency between the examples cited and the thing thus illustrated . The painter turning poet , the poet turning painter , the moon turning her unseen face to a mortal lover ; these are compared to Browning the poet ,— writing another poem . The only difference in his art is that the poet here speaks for himself in the first person , and not , as usual , dramatically in the third person . The idea of the poem may be found , stripped of digression and fanciful comparisons , in the eighth , twelfth , fourteenth , seventeenth , and eighteenth stanzas . Something of the same idea appears in My Star .</p>
     <p>5 . = Rafael ,= etc . More commonly spelled Raphael . Born in Italy in 1483 , died in 1520 ; generally regarded as the greatest of painters . The Sistine Madonna , at Dresden , is considered his greatest work . See lines 21-24 .</p>
