     <l n="2">“ The raven has ascended to the nest of the nightingale . ”</l>
     <l n="3">Persian Poem</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The following pieces , selections from a huge and undigested mass of translation , accumulated during several years devoted to philological pursuits , are with much diffidence offered to the public , the writer being fully aware that not unfrequently he has failed in giving his version that cast and turn , which constitute no slight part of the beauty of the original ; a point the accomplishment of which the poetical Translator ought , in all instances , to bear particularly in view , but which he will invariably find the most difficult part of the task which he has undertaken ; in comparison with which the rendering of the diction of his Author into tolerable verse is an easy achievement . Perhaps no person , amongst the many individuals who have distinguished themselves by skill in the targumannic art , has more successfully surmounted this difficulty than Fairfax , the Translator into English “ octave rhyme ” of “ The Jerusalem , ” the master-piece of the greatest poet of modern Italy and , with one exception , of modern time .</p>
   <p>That the character of a nation is best distinguishable by the general tone of its poetry , has been frequently remarked , and is a truth which does not admit of controversy ; the soft songs of the Persian , and the bold and warlike ditties of the Dane are emblems of the effeminacy of the one , and the reckless heroism of the other .— In most instances the writer in the selection of pieces for this little work has been guided by a desire of exhibiting what is most characteristic of the people to whose literature it belongs . At the same time , he has been careful that this desire should not lead him to the countenancing of any thing which could be considered as pregnant with injury to good taste and morals , and has in consequence been compelled to exclude from his anthology many a glorious flower , which he would gladly have woven therein , had he not been apprehensive that it was the offspring of a poisonous bulb . He cannot refrain from lamenting that in his literary researches he has too often found amongst the writings of those , most illustrious for their genius and imagination , the least of that which is calculated to meet the approbation of the Christian , or even of the mere Moralist ; and in conclusion he will take the liberty of addressing to those who may feel within them the stirrings of a mind capable of mighty things , the sublime words , slightly modified , of an Arabian sage and poet : O man , though the years of thy worldly fame are destined to be equal in number to the doves of the heaven , they shall nevertheless have an end , but whatever thou shalt do or say , which is founded on the love of wisdom and of God , shall endure for ever .</p>

    <head>WOINOMOINEN .</head>
     <l n="1">From the Finnish .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Woinomoinen was , according to the Mythology of the ancient Finns , the second Godhead , being only inferior to Jumala . He was master of the musical art , and when he played upon his instrument produced much the same effect as the Grecian Orpheus , enticing fishes from the stream and the wild animals from the forest . The lines here translated are a fragment of a poem which describes a musical contest between Woinomoinen and the Giant Joukkawainen , in which the latter was signally defeated .</p>

     <l n="1">Then the ancient Woinomoinen ,</l>
     <l n="2">On the bench himself he seated ,</l>
     <l n="3">Took the harp betwixt his fingers ,</l>
     <l n="4">On his knee about he turn 'd it ,</l>
     <l n="5">In his hand he fitly plac 'd it .</l>
     <l n="6">Play 'd the ancient Woinomoinen ,</l>
     <l n="7">Universal joy awaking ;</l>
     <l n="8">Like a concert was his playing ;</l>
     <l n="9">There was nothing in the forest</l>

     <l n="11">On four lengthy legs that stalketh ,</l>

     <l n="16">‘ Gainst the hedge the bear up-bounded .</l>

     <l n="18">On two whirring pinions flying ,</l>

     <l n="21">With six fins about that roweth ,</l>

    <head>SIR SINCLAIR . { 51 }</head>
     <l n="1">From the Danish of Edward Storm .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>( At the commencement of the last century , Colonel Sinclair , a Scotsman in the service of the King of Sweden , landed upon the coast of Norway , at the time war was raging between the Danish and Swedish crowns , with a band of Scots which he had levied in his native country . After committing much havoc and cruelty , the invaders were destroyed to a man in a conflict with the peasantry , who had assembled in considerable number . Many of the broad-swords lost by the Scots in this encounter are to be seen in the Museum of Copenhagen , trophies of a victory achieved in a hallowed cause — the defence of the father-land against unprovoked aggression . )</p>

    <head>THE HISTORY OF TALIESIN .</head>
     <l n="1">From the Ancient British .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Talieson was a foundling , discovered in his infancy lying in a coracle , on a salmon-weir , in the domain of Elphin , a prince of North Wales , who became his patron . During his life he arrogated to himself a supernatural descent and understanding , and for at least a thousand years after his death he was regarded by the descendants of the ancient Britons in the character of a prophet or something more . The poems which he produced procured for him the title of “ Bardic King ; ” they display much that is vigorous and original , but are disfigured by mysticism and extravagant metaphor ; one of the most spirited of them is the following , which the Author calls his “ Hanes ” or history .</p>

    <head>THE RISING OF ACHILLES .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">From the Iliad .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="2">Straightway Achilles arose , the belov 'd of Jove , round his shoulders</l>
     <l n="3">Brawny her AEgis spread , fair fring 'd , his guardian Athena ,</l>
     <l n="4">And his head with a cloud of golden hue and transparent</l>
     <l n="5">She has encircled about , whence darted fire resplendent .</l>
     <l n="6">As when fire from the town ascending clambers the ether</l>
     <l n="7">Out of the island afar , around which enemies gather —</l>
     <l n="8">Fierce the defenders all day engage in desperate warfare ,</l>
     <l n="9">Forth from the town advanc 'd ; but soon as the sun has descended</l>
     <l n="10">Flame with beacons the dense , huge turrets ; upwards the blazes</l>
     <l n="11">Flaring , struggling ascend to be seen by friends and by neighbours ,</l>
     <l n="12">If with assistance in war o'er the sea in ships they are coming —</l>
     <l n="13">So from Achilles 's head uptower 'd the blazes to heaven ;</l>
     <l n="14">Striding from out the wall , he stood o'er the trench , but he mingled</l>
     <l n="15">Not with the Greeks , for he heeded his mother 's solemn injunction ;</l>
     <l n="16">Standing , he shouted there , conjointly Pallas Athena</l>
     <l n="17">Scream 'd , and trouble immense was caus 'd thereby to the Trojans ;</l>
     <l n="18">Like to the clamorous sound that 's heard , when pealing the trumpet</l>
     <l n="19">Thrills through the city , besieg 'd by bands of turbulent foemen ,</l>
     <l n="20">E'en was the clamorous sound sent forth by Eacus ’ grandson —</l>
     <l n="21">Soon as the dreadful voice was heard of Eacus ’ grandson ,</l>
     <l n="22">All their minds were amaz 'd — the fair-man 'd beautiful horses</l>
     <l n="23">Back 'd with the chariots amain , such fear was awak 'd in their bosoms ;</l>
     <l n="24">Ghasted the charioteers survey 'd the untameable blazes</l>
     <l n="25">Horribly round the brow of high , heroic Peleides</l>
     <l n="26">Burning , ignited by her the blue-eyed Goddess Athena</l>
     <l n="27">Thrice then o'er the deep trench loud shouted god-like Achilles ,</l>
     <l n="28">Thrice were the Trojans confus 'd and all their illustrious aiders ;</l>
     <l n="29">Already round that trench had twice six champions fallen ,</l>
     <l n="30">Spoil 'd of their chariots and arms , so that gladly now the Achaians</l>
     <l n="31">Out of the tempest of darts the slain Patroclus dragging</l>
     <l n="32">Plac 'd on the sorrowful couch ; his comrades round it arrang 'd them</l>
     <l n="33">Loudly lamenting , and thither there came swift-footed Achilles</l>
     <l n="34">Shedding the hottest of tears , when he saw his comrade so faithful</l>
     <l n="35">Stretch 'd on that sorrowful couch , transfixt with the sharp pointed iron —</l>
     <l n="36">Him he had lately despatch 'd with chariot and steeds to the war-field</l>
     <l n="37">Never , alas , to receive from that red war-field returning .</l>

     <l n="19">E'er was so blest , as Thou , or ever will be , O Achilles ,</l>
     <l n="20">For when alive , as a God , we Argives held thee in honor ;</l>
     <l n="21">Now e'en here , how high above the mighty departed</l>
     <l n="22">Thou dost in majesty rise ; grieve not though dead , O Achilles .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="23">Soon as these words I 'd said , the Shade in answer address 'd me :</l>
     <l n="24">Talk not of death to me , in mercy , glorious Odysses ,</l>
     <l n="25">For on the Earth 's green sod I 'd rather toil as the hireling</l>
     <l n="26">Of some inglorious wight , and of one as poor as inglorious ,</l>
     <l n="27">Than over all the dead in Hades reign as a Monarch ;</l>
     <l n="28">But of my noble boy some tiding give me , I pray thee ,</l>
     <l n="29">Whether or not he 's fam 'd as a gallant leader in battle ;</l>
     <l n="30">And if aught thou hast heard of good old Peleus , tell me ;</l>
     <l n="31">Still is he held in dread in Myrmidonian cities ,</l>
     <l n="32">Or has he lost respect in Hellas-land and in Pthia ,</l>
     <l n="33">Now old age has robb 'd his hands and feet of their vigour ?</l>
     <l n="34">Think not an aid so good I 'm now in the light of the sun-beam ,</l>
     <l n="35">As of old time I prov 'd on the broad domain of the Trojans ,</l>
     <l n="36">When , in the Argives aid , I slew the best of their army ;</l>

     <l n="42">But the whole tale of thy boy , thy Neoptolemus cherish 'd ,</l>

     <l n="46">Ever when round Troy 's town in council grave we assembled</l>
     <l n="47">He was the first to rise with a flow of eloquence faultless ,</l>
     <l n="48">So that Nestor divine and myself confess 'd him our master ;</l>
     <l n="49">But when on Troy 's champain we strove with spear and with buckler</l>
     <l n="50">Never amid the crowd you 'd have found him or in the phalanx —</l>
     <l n="51">Far in front he advanc 'd , in courage shining the foremost ,</l>
     <l n="52">And full many a man he slew in the rage of the combat ;</l>
     <l n="53">There 's no need to recount and to name in endless succession</l>
     <l n="54">All the renown 'd he slew , whilst assisting strongly the Argives ;</l>
     <l n="55">Let it suffice that with steel he stretch 'd Eurypilus lifeless ,</l>
     <l n="56">Telephos ’ hero-son , and around that hero were slaughter 'd</l>
     <l n="57">All his Ceteian friends , ensnar 'd by the smiles of the damsels .</l>

     <l n="60">Where we reclin 'd thick and close , and one o'er the other we panted ,—</l>
     <l n="61">Then whilst the rest of the chiefs and princes high of the Argives</l>
     <l n="62">Wip 'd away feminine tears , and each shook in every member ,</l>
     <l n="63">Him in that hour of dread these orbs of vision beheld not</l>
     <l n="64">Either grow pallid or quake , or away from his cheek fresh and downy</l>
     <l n="65">Wiping the tears — O no ! and ever he begg 'd for the signal</l>
     <l n="66">Forth from the horse to emerge ; and with ill intent to the Trojan ,</l>
     <l n="67">Ever his spear he grip 'd , or rattled the hilt of his falchion —</l>

     <l n="5">When I 'm gone , wear thou my trappings , and be captain , as is fit ;</l>
     <l n="6">And do ye , my merry fellows , now my vacant sabre take ,</l>
     <l n="7">And therewith green branches cutting , straight for me a pallet make ;</l>
     <l n="8">Some one for the holy father , that I may confess me , run ,</l>
     <l n="9">And that I to him may whisper all the crimes , in life I 've done ;</l>
     <l n="10">I 've full thirty years as warrior , twenty five as robber pass 'd ;</l>
     <l n="11">Now I feel my end approaching , and I fain would breathe my last ;</l>
     <l n="12">Me a tomb that 's broad and lofty , O forget not to prepare ,</l>
     <l n="13">For erect I 'll stand within it , as in war , and weapons bear :</l>
     <l n="14">On the right side leave an opening , that the merry larks in spring ,</l>
     <l n="15">Of its coming , welcome coming , may to me the tiding bring ,</l>
     <l n="16">And for me in May 's sweet season nightingales may sweetly sing .</l>

    <head>THE SORCERIES OF CANIDIA .</head>
     <l n="1">From Horace .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>( Canidia and other witches , having enticed a boy of high birth into some secret cell , proceed to bury him in the earth , up to the chin ; in order that , when he has perished with hunger in that situation , his liver etc . may serve as ingredients for a draught , by administering which Canidia purposes to regain the affection of Varus , who has deserted her . The poem commences with the entreaties of the boy , and concludes with the imprecations which he utters when about to be abandoned to famine and inhumation . )</p>

     <l n="11">Stript of his tests of lineage fair</l>
     <l n="12">He stood , who rais 'd this piteous cry —</l>
     <l n="13">A boy , of form which might have made</l>
     <l n="14">The Thracian furies ’ bosoms kind .</l>
     <l n="15">Canidia with her uncomb 'd head</l>

     <l n="20">And plume , by night-owl lately worn ,</l>
     <l n="21">Herbs too , which Iolchos and Spain</l>

     <l n="23">And bone from hungry mastiff ta'en ,</l>
     <l n="24">Straight to be burn 'd in magic fire .</l>
     <l n="25">And now the witch strode through the house ,</l>
     <l n="26">Hell-waters scattering wide around ;</l>
     <l n="27">Her hair like hedgehog 's bristling rose ,</l>
     <l n="28">Or like the boar 's whom hunters wound .</l>
     <l n="29">Veia , by pity unrestrain 'd ,</l>
     <l n="30">With pick-axe hastes the ground to tear ,</l>

     <l n="32">That the poor wretch imburied there</l>
     <l n="33">Might slowly die , in sight of food</l>
     <l n="34">Renew 'd each day , his head so far</l>
     <l n="35">Extant from earth , as from the flood</l>
     <l n="36">The heads of swimmers extant are ;</l>
     <l n="37">That the parch 'd marrow and the dry</l>

     <l n="51">From Ganges hastening , to all things again</l>
     <l n="52">Their native hue restores Day 's harbinger .</l>
     <l n="53">Perhaps thou'st come , and ah , my cruel pain</l>

     <l n="58">To me thy wand be never more applied !</l>
     <l n="59">Away , away ! grim Death can blunt alone</l>
     <l n="60">My miseries ’ point , and ne'er till life be spent</l>
     <l n="61">I shall the hour of dear repose have won .</l>
     <l n="62">O how the strife within is vehement !</l>
     <l n="63">Now reason wins , now madness holds the sway ;</l>
     <l n="64">So much my ill can do , nor I prevent .</l>
     <l n="65">O may this soul of mine from out its clay</l>
     <l n="66">Fly to repose elsewhere ! I 'm sure to see</l>
     <l n="67">My last hour once ; and though far , far away</l>
