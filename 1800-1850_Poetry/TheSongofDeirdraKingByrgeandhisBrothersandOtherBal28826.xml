     <l n="2">Farewell , grey Albyn , much loved land ,</l>
     <l n="3">I ne ’ er shall see thy hills again ;</l>
     <l n="4">Upon those hills I oft would stand</l>
     <l n="5">And view the chase sweep o ’ er the plain .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="6">’ Twas pleasant from their tops I ween</l>
     <l n="7">To see the stag that bounding ran ;</l>
     <l n="8">And all the rout of hunters keen ,</l>
     <l n="9">The sons of Usna in the van .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="10">The chiefs of Albyn feasted high ,</l>
     <l n="11">Amidst them Usna ’ s children shone ;</l>
     <l n="12">And Nasa kissed in secrecy</l>
     <l n="13">The daughter fair of high Dundron .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="14">To her a milk-white doe he sent ,</l>
     <l n="15">With little fawn that frisked and played</l>
     <l n="16">And once to visit her he went ,</l>
     <l n="17">As home from Inverness he strayed .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="18">The news was scarcely brought to me</l>
     <l n="19">When jealous rage inflamed my mind ;</l>
     <l n="20">I took my boat and rushed to sea ,</l>
     <l n="21">For death , for speedy death , inclined .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="22">But swiftly swimming at my stern</l>
     <l n="23">Came Ainlie bold and Ardan tall ;</l>
     <l n="24">Those faithful striplings made me turn</l>
     <l n="25">And brought me back to Nasa ’ s hall .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="26">Then thrice he swore upon his arms ,</l>
     <l n="27">His burnished arms , the foeman ’ s bane ,</l>

     <l n="29">In this fond breast of mine again .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="30">Dundron ’ s fair daughter also swore ,</l>

     <l n="33">A maiden she would live and die .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="34">Ah did she know that slain in fight ,</l>
     <l n="35">He wets with gore the Irish hill ,</l>
     <l n="36">How great would be her moan this night ,</l>
     <l n="37">But greater far would mine be still .</l>

     <l n="38">THE DIVER</l>
     <l n="39">A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="40">“ Where is the man who will dive for his King ,</l>
     <l n="41">In the pool as it rushes with turbulent sweep ?</l>
     <l n="42">A cup from this surf-beaten jetty I fling ,</l>
     <l n="43">And he who will seek it below in the deep ,</l>
     <l n="44">And will bring it again to the light of the day ,</l>
     <l n="45">As the meed of his valour shall bear it away .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="46">“ Now courage , my knights , and my warriors bold ,</l>
     <l n="47">For , one , two , and three , and away it shall go —”</l>
     <l n="48">He toss ’ d , as he said it , the goblet of gold</l>
     <l n="49">Deep , deep in the howling abysses below .—</l>
     <l n="50">“ Where is the hero who ventures to brave</l>
     <l n="51">The whirl of the pool , and the break of the wave ?”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="52">The steel-coated lancemen , and nobles around ,</l>
     <l n="53">Spoke not , but they trembled in silent surprise ,</l>
     <l n="54">And pale they all stood on the cliff ’ s giddy bound ,</l>
     <l n="55">And no one would venture to dive for the prize .</l>
     <l n="56">“ Three times have I spoke , but no hero will spring</l>
     <l n="57">And dive for the goblet , and dive for the King .”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="58">But still they were silent and pale as before ,</l>
     <l n="59">Till a brave son of Eirin , in venturous pride ,</l>
     <l n="60">Dash ’ d forth from the lancemen ’ s trembling corps</l>
     <l n="61">And canted his helm , cast his mantle aside ,</l>
     <l n="62">While spearman , and noble , and lady , and knight ,</l>
     <l n="63">Gazed on the bold stripling in breathless affright .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="64">Unmoved by the thoughts of his horrible doom ,</l>
     <l n="65">He mounted the cliff — and he paus ’ d on his leap ,</l>
     <l n="66">For the waves which the pool had imbibed in its womb</l>
     <l n="67">Were spouted in thunder again from the deep ,—</l>
     <l n="68">Yes ! as they return ’ d , their report was as loud</l>
     <l n="69">As the peal when it bursts from the storm-riven cloud .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="70">It roared , and it drizzled , it hiss ’ d and it whirl ’ d ,</l>
     <l n="71">And it bubbled like water when mingled with flame ,</l>
     <l n="72">And columns of foam to the heaven were hurl ’ d ,</l>
     <l n="73">And billow on billow tumultuously came ;</l>
     <l n="74">It seem ’ d that the womb of the ocean would bear</l>
     <l n="75">Sea over sea to the uppermost air .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="76">It thundered again as the wave gathered slow ,</l>
     <l n="77">And black from the drizzling foam as it fell ,</l>
     <l n="78">The mouth of the fathomless tunnel below</l>
     <l n="79">Was seen like the pass to the regions of hell ;</l>
     <l n="80">The waters roll round it , and gather and boom ,</l>
     <l n="81">And then all at once disappear in the gloom .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="19">
     <l n="82">And now ere the waves had returned from the deep ,</l>
     <l n="83">The youth wiped the sweat-drops which hung on his brows ,</l>
     <l n="84">And he plunged — and the cataracts over him sweep ,</l>
     <l n="85">And a shout from his terrified comrades arose ;</l>
     <l n="86">And then there succeeded a horrible pause</l>
     <l n="87">For the whirlpool had clos ’ d its mysterious jaws .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="20">
     <l n="88">And stiller it grew on the watery waste ,</l>
     <l n="89">In the womb of the ocean it bellow ’ d alone ,</l>
     <l n="90">The knights said their Aves in terrified haste ,</l>
     <l n="91">And crowded each pinnacle , jetty , and stone :</l>
     <l n="92">“ The high-hearted stripling is whelm ’ d in the tide ,</l>
     <l n="93">Ah ! wail him ,” was echoed from every side .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="21">
     <l n="94">“ If the monarch had buried his crown in the pool</l>
     <l n="95">And said : ‘ He shall wear it who brings it again ,’</l>
     <l n="96">I would not have been so insensate a fool</l>
     <l n="97">As to dive when all hope of returning were vain ;</l>
     <l n="98">What heaven conceals in the gulfs of the deep ,</l>
     <l n="99">Lies buried for ever , and there it must sleep .”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="22">
     <l n="100">Full many a burden the whirlpool had borne ,</l>
     <l n="101">And spouted it forth on the drizzling surge ,</l>
     <l n="102">But nought but a mast that was splinter ’ d and torn ,</l>
     <l n="103">Or the hull of a vessel was seen to emerge ;</l>
     <l n="104">But wider and wider it opens its jaws ,</l>
     <l n="105">And louder it gurgles , and louder it draws .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="23">
     <l n="106">It drizzled , it thunder ’ d , it hiss ’ d and it whirl ’ d ,</l>
     <l n="107">And it bubbled like water when mingled with flame ,</l>
     <l n="108">And columns of foam to the heaven were hurl ’ d ,</l>
     <l n="109">And flood upon flood from the deep tunnel came ;</l>
     <l n="110">And then with a noise like the storm from the North ,</l>
     <l n="111">The hellish eruption was vomited forth .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="24">
     <l n="112">But , ah ! what is that on the wave ’ s foamy brim ,</l>
     <l n="113">Disgorged with an ocean of wreck and of wood ?</l>
     <l n="114">’ Tis the snow-white arm and the shoulder of him</l>
     <l n="115">Who daringly dived for the glittering meed :</l>
     <l n="116">’ Tis he , ’ tis the stripling so hardy and bold ,</l>
     <l n="117">Who swings in his left hand the goblet of gold .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="25">
     <l n="118">He draws a long breath as the breaker he leaves ,</l>
     <l n="119">Then swims through the water with many a strain ,</l>
     <l n="120">While all his companions exultingly heave</l>
     <l n="121">Their voices above the wild din of the main :</l>
     <l n="122">“’ Tis he , O ! ’ tis he , from the horrible hole</l>
     <l n="123">The brave one has rescued his body and soul .”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="26">
     <l n="124">He reach ’ d the tall jetty , and kneeling he laid</l>
     <l n="125">The massy gold goblet in triumph and pride</l>
     <l n="126">At the foot of the monarch , who instantly made</l>
     <l n="127">A sign to his daughter who stood by his side :</l>
     <l n="128">She fill ’ d it with wine , and the youth with a spring</l>
     <l n="129">Received it , and quaff ’ d it , and turn ’ d to the King .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="27">
     <l n="130">“ Long life to the monarch ! how happy are they</l>
     <l n="131">Who breathe and exist in the sun ’ s rosy light ,</l>
     <l n="132">But he who is doom ’ d in the ocean to stray ,</l>
     <l n="133">Views nothing around him but horror and night ;</l>
     <l n="134">Let no one henceforward be tempted like me</l>
     <l n="135">To pry in the secrets contain ’ d in the sea .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="28">
     <l n="136">“ I felt myself seized , with the quickness of thought</l>
     <l n="137">The whirlpool entomb ’ d me in body and limb ,</l>
     <l n="138">And billow on billow tumultuously brought</l>
     <l n="139">It ’ s cataracts o ’ er me ; in vain did I swim ,</l>
     <l n="140">For like a mere pebble with horrible sound</l>
     <l n="141">The force of the double stream twisted me round .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="29">
     <l n="142">“ But God in his mercy , for to him alone</l>
     <l n="143">In the moment of danger I ever have clung ,</l>
     <l n="144">Did bear me towards a projection of stone :</l>
     <l n="145">I seized it in transport , and round it I hung ,</l>
     <l n="146">The goblet lay too on a corally ledge ,</l>
     <l n="147">Which jutted just over the cataract ’ s edge .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="30">
     <l n="148">“ And then I look ’ d downward , and horribly deep ,</l>

     <l n="150">And though to the hearing it ever might sleep ,</l>
     <l n="151">Yet still the eye clouded with terror might know ,</l>
     <l n="152">That serpents and creatures that made my blood cool ,</l>
     <l n="153">Were swimming and splashing about in the pool .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="31">
     <l n="154">“ Ball ’ d up to a mass , in a moment uncoil ’ d ,</l>

     <l n="156">And down in the billows which over them boil ’ d</l>
     <l n="157">I saw a behemoth contend with a shark ;</l>
     <l n="158">The sounds of their hideous duel awaken</l>
     <l n="159">The black-bellied whale , and the slumbering craken .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="32">
     <l n="160">“ Still , still did I linger forlorn , and oppress ’ d</l>
     <l n="161">With a feeling of terror that curdled my blood ;</l>
     <l n="162">Ah think of a human and sensible breast</l>
     <l n="163">Enclosed with the hideous shapes of the flood ;</l>
     <l n="164">Still , still did I linger , but far from the reach</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="33">
     <l n="166">“ Methought that a serpent towards me did creep ,</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="34">
     <l n="172">He then was retiring , a look from the King</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="35">
     <l n="178">The daughter heard that with compassionate thought ,</l>
