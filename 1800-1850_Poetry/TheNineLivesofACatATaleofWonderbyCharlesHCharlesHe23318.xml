    <head>PREFACE</head>
    <p n="1">This tale of wonder is told for children ; with which view , it has been carefully designed and very nicely printed .</p>
    <p n="2">For some time past , it has arrived at the dignity of a popular Nursery Tale in the Author 's family ; and it is hoped it will merit the same good fortune elsewhere .</p>
    <p n="3">It will be worth while explaining , that the circle in each page is made to represent some object in connection with the story ; and , that as some of them have proved rather puzzling , to Juvenile admirers has been left the task of “ finding them out . ”</p>
    <p n="4">London , 1859 .</p>
