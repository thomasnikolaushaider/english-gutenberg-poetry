     <l n="2">And left his celts and clay ,</l>
     <l n="3">On yon fair slope of sunlit ground</l>
     <l n="4">That fronts your garden gay ;</l>
     <l n="5">The Roman came , he bore the sway ,</l>
     <l n="6">He bullied , bought , and sold ,</l>
     <l n="7">Your fountain sweeps his works away</l>

     <l n="9">But still his crumbling urns are found</l>
     <l n="10">Within the window-bay ,</l>
     <l n="11">Where once he listened to the sound</l>
     <l n="12">That lulls you day by day ;—</l>
     <l n="13">The sound of summer winds at play ,</l>
     <l n="14">The noise of waters cold</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="17">The Roman fell : his firm-set bound</l>
     <l n="18">Became the Saxon 's stay ;</l>

    <head>THE BARBAROUS BIRD-GODS : A SAVAGE PARABASIS .</head>
    <note>The myth in the “ Birds ” of Aristophanes , which represents Birds as older than the Gods , may have been a genuine Greek tradition . The following lines show how prevalent is the myth among widely severed races . The Mexican Bird-gods I omit ; who can rhyme to Huitzilopochtli ?</note>
     <l n="1">The Birds Sing :</l>
   </lg>
   <p>We would have you to wit , that on eggs though we sit , and are spiked on the spit , and are baked in the pan , Birds are older by far than your ancestors are , and made love and made war ere the making of Man ! For when all things were dark , not a glimmer nor spark , and the world like a barque without rudder or sail Floated on through the night , ‘ t was a Bird struck a light , ‘ t was a flash from the bright feather 'd Tonatiu 's<span type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>tail ! Then the Hawk<span type="note_anchor">[ 4 ]</span>with some dry wood flew up in the sky , and afar , safe and high , the Hawk lit Sun and Moon , And the Birds of the air they rejoiced everywhere , and they recked not of care that should come on them soon . For the Hawk , so they tell , was then known as Pundjel ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 5 ]</span>and a-musing he fell at the close of the day ; Then he went on the quest , as we thought , of a nest , with some bark of the best , and a clawful of clay ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 6 ]</span>And with these did he frame two birds lacking a name , without feathers ( his game was a puzzle to all ) ; Next around them he fluttered a-dancing , and muttered ; and , lastly , he uttered a magical call : Then the figures of clay , as they featherless lay , they leaped up , who but they , and embracing they fell , And this was the baking of Man , and his making ; but now he 's forsaking his Father , Pundjel ! Now these creatures of mire , they kept whining for fire , and to crown their desire who was found but the Wren ?</p>
   <p>To the high heaven he came , from the Sun stole he flame , and for this has a name in the memory of men !<span type="note_anchor">[ 7 ]</span>And in India who for the Soma juice flew , and to men brought it through without falter or fail ? Why the Hawk ‘ t was again , and great Indra to men would appear , now and then , in the shape of a Quail , While the Thlinkeet 's delight is the Bird of the Night , the beak and the bright ebon plumage of Yehl .<span type="note_anchor">[ 8 ]</span>And who for man 's need brought the famed Suttung 's mead ? why ‘ t is told in the creed of the Sagamen strong , ‘ T was the Eagle god who brought the drink from the blue , and gave mortals the brew that 's the fountain of song .<span type="note_anchor">[ 9 ]</span>Next , who gave men their laws ? and what reason or cause the young brave overawes when in need of a squaw , Till he thinks it a shame to wed one of his name , and his conduct you blame if he thus breaks the law ? For you still hold it wrong if a lubra<span type="note_anchor">[ 10 ]</span>belong to the self-same kobong<span type="note_anchor">[ 11 ]</span>that is Father of you , To take her as a bride to your ebony side ; nay , you give her a wide berth ; quite right of you , too . For her father , you know , is your father , the Crow , and no blessing but woe from the wedding would spring . Well , these rules they were made in the wattle-gum shade , and were strictly obeyed , when the Crow was the King .<span type="note_anchor">[ 12 ]</span>Thus on Earth 's little ball to the Birds you owe all , yet your gratitude 's small for the favours they 've done , And their feathers you pill , and you eat them at will , yes , you plunder and kill the bright birds one by one ; There ‘ s a price on their head , and the Dodo is dead , and the Moa has fled from the sight of the sun !</p>

   <p>HESPEROTHEN .</p>
   <p>By the example of certain Grecian mariners , who , being safely returned from the war about Troy , leave yet again their old lands and gods , seeking they know not what , and choosing neither to abide in the fair Phæacian island , nor to dwell and die with the Sirens , at length end miserably in a desert country by the sea , is set forth the Vanity of Melancholy . And by the land of Phæacia is to be understood the place of Art and of fair Pleasures ; and by Circe 's Isle , the places of bodily delights , whereof men , falling aweary attain to Eld , and to the darkness of that age .
