     <item>POEMS SUBJECTIVE AND REMINISCENT : MEMORIES RAPHAEL EGO THE PUMPKIN FORGIVENESS TO MY SISTER MY THANKS REMEMBRANCE MY NAMESAKE A MEMORY MY DREAM THE BAREFOOT BOY MY PSALM THE WAITING</item>
     <item>POEMS SUBJECTIVE AND REMINISCENT MEMORIES</item>
     <item>A beautiful and happy girl , With step as light as summer air , Eyes glad with smiles , and brow of pearl , Shadowed by many a careless curl Of unconfined and flowing hair ; A seeming child in everything , Save thoughtful brow and ripening charms , As Nature wears the smile of Spring When sinking into Summer 's arms .</item>
     <item>A mind rejoicing in the light Which melted through its graceful bower , Leaf after leaf , dew-moist and bright , And stainless in its holy white , Unfolding like a morning flower A heart , which , like a fine-toned lute , With every breath of feeling woke , And , even when the tongue was mute , From eye and lip in music spoke .</item>
     <item>How thrills once more the lengthening chain Of memory , at the thought of thee ! Old hopes which long in dust have lain Old dreams , come thronging back again , And boyhood lives again in me ; I feel its glow upon my cheek , Its fulness of the heart is mine , As when I leaned to hear thee speak , Or raised my doubtful eye to thine .</item>
     <item>I hear again thy low replies , I feel thy arm within my own , And timidly again uprise The fringed lids of hazel eyes , With soft brown tresses overblown . Ah ! memories of sweet summer eves , Of moonlit wave and willowy way , Of stars and flowers , and dewy leaves , And smiles and tones more dear than they !</item>
     <item>Ere this , thy quiet eye hath smiled My picture of thy youth to see , When , half a woman , half a child , Thy very artlessness beguiled , And folly 's self seemed wise in thee ; I too can smile , when o'er that hour The lights of memory backward stream , Yet feel the while that manhood 's power Is vainer than my boyhood 's dream .</item>
     <item>Years have passed on , and left their trace , Of graver care and deeper thought ; And unto me the calm , cold face Of manhood , and to thee the grace Of woman 's pensive beauty brought . More wide , perchance , for blame than praise , The school-boy 's humble name has flown ; Thine , in the green and quiet ways Of unobtrusive goodness known .</item>
     <item>And wider yet in thought and deed Diverge our pathways , one in youth ; Thine the Genevan 's sternest creed , While answers to my spirit 's need The Derby dalesman 's simple truth . For thee , the priestly rite and prayer , And holy day , and solemn psalm ; For me , the silent reverence where My brethren gather , slow and calm .</item>
     <item>Yet hath thy spirit left on me An impress Time has worn not out , And something of myself in thee , A shadow from the past , I see , Lingering , even yet , thy way about ; Not wholly can the heart unlearn That lesson of its better hours , Not yet has Time 's dull footstep worn To common dust that path of flowers .</item>

    <docDate>Thus , while at times before our eyes The shadows melt , and fall apart , And , smiling through them , round us lies The warm light of our morning skies ,— The Indian Summer of the heart ! In secret sympathies of mind , In founts of feeling which retain Their pure , fresh flow , we yet may find Our early dreams not wholly vain<date>1841</date>. RAPHAEL . Suggested by the portrait of Raphael , at the age of fifteen . I shall not soon forget that sight The glow of Autumn 's westering day , A hazy warmth , a dreamy light , On Raphael 's picture lay . It was a simple print I saw , The fair face of a musing boy ; Yet , while I gazed , a sense of awe Seemed blending with my joy . A simple print ,— the graceful flow Of boyhood 's soft and wavy hair , And fresh young lip and cheek , and brow Unmarked and clear , were there . Yet through its sweet and calm repose I saw the inward spirit shine ; It was as if before me rose The white veil of a shrine .</docDate>
    <docTitle><titlePart>As if , as Gothland 's sage has told , The hidden life , the man within , Dissevered from its frame and mould , By mortal eye were seen . Was it the lifting of that eye , The waving of that pictured hand ? Loose as a cloud-wreath on the sky , I saw the walls expand . The narrow room had vanished ,— space , Broad , luminous , remained alone , Through which all hues and shapes of grace And beauty looked or shone . Around the mighty master came The marvels which his pencil wrought , Those miracles of power whose fame Is wide as human thought . There drooped thy more than mortal face , O Mother , beautiful and mild Enfolding in one dear embrace Thy Saviour and thy Child ! The rapt brow of the Desert John ; The awful glory of that day When all the Father 's brightness shone Through manhood 's veil of clay . And , midst gray prophet forms , and wild Dark visions of the days of old , How sweetly woman 's beauty smiled Through locks of brown and gold ! There Fornarina 's fair young face Once more upon her lover shone , Whose model of an angel 's grace He borrowed from her own . Slow passed that vision from my view , But not the lesson which it taught ; The soft , calm shadows which it threw Still rested on my thought : The truth , that painter , bard , and sage , Even in Earth 's cold and changeful clime , Plant for their deathless heritage The fruits and flowers of time . We shape ourselves the joy or fear Of which the coming life is made , And fill our Future 's atmosphere With sunshine or with shade . The tissue of the Life to be We weave with colors all our own , And in the field of Destiny We reap as we have sown . Still shall the soul around it call The shadows which it gathered here , And , painted on the eternal wall , The Past shall reappear . Think ye the notes of holy song On Milton 's tuneful ear have died ? Think ye that Raphael 's angel throng Has vanished from his side ?</titlePart></docTitle>
    <docDate>Oh no !— We live our life again ; Or warmly touched , or coldly dim , The pictures of the Past remain ,— -  Man 's works shall follow him !<date>1842</date>. EGO . WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF A FRIEND . On page of thine I cannot trace The cold and heartless commonplace , A statue 's fixed and marble grace . For ever as these lines I penned , Still with the thought of thee will blend That of some loved and common friend , Who in life 's desert track has made His pilgrim tent with mine , or strayed Beneath the same remembered shade . And hence my pen unfettered moves In freedom which the heart approves , The negligence which friendship loves . And wilt thou prize my poor gift less For simple air and rustic dress , And sign of haste and carelessness ? Oh , more than specious counterfeit Of sentiment or studied wit , A heart like thine should value it . Yet half I fear my gift will be Unto thy book , if not to thee , Of more than doubtful courtesy . A banished name from Fashion 's sphere , A lay unheard of Beauty 's ear , Forbid , disowned ,— what do they here ? Upon my ear not all in vain Came the sad captive 's clanking chain , The groaning from his bed of pain . And sadder still , I saw the woe Which only wounded spirits know When Pride 's strong footsteps o'er them go . Spurned not alone in walks abroad , But from the temples of the Lord Thrust out apart , like things abhorred . Deep as I felt , and stern and strong , In words which Prudence smothered long , My soul spoke out against the wrong ; Not mine alone the task to speak Of comfort to the poor and weak , And dry the tear on Sorrow 's cheek ; But , mingled in the conflict warm , To pour the fiery breath of storm Through the harsh trumpet of Reform ; To brave Opinion 's settled frown , From ermined robe and saintly gown , While wrestling reverenced Error down . Founts gushed beside my pilgrim way , Cool shadows on the greensward lay , Flowers swung upon the bending spray . And , broad and bright , on either hand , Stretched the green slopes of Fairy-land , With Hope 's eternal sunbow spanned ; Whence voices called me like the flow , Which on the listener 's ear will grow , Of forest streamlets soft and low . And gentle eyes , which still retain Their picture on the heart and brain , Smiled , beckoning from that path of pain . In vain ! nor dream , nor rest , nor pause Remain for him who round him draws The battered mail of Freedom 's cause . From youthful hopes , from each green spot Of young Romance , and gentle Thought , Where storm and tumult enter not ; From each fair altar , where belong The offerings Love requires of Song In homage to her bright-eyed throng ; With soul and strength , with heart and hand , I turned to Freedom 's struggling band , To the sad Helots of our land . What marvel then that Fame should turn Her notes of praise to those of scorn ; Her gifts reclaimed , her smiles withdrawn ? What matters it ? a few years more , Life 's surge so restless heretofore Shall break upon the unknown shore ! In that far land shall disappear The shadows which we follow here , The mist-wreaths of our atmosphere ! Before no work of mortal hand , Of human will or strength expand The pearl gates of the Better Land ; Alone in that great love which gave Life to the sleeper of the grave , Resteth the power to seek and save . Yet , if the spirit gazing through The vista of the past can view One deed to Heaven and virtue true ; If through the wreck of wasted powers , Of garlands wreathed from Folly 's bowers , Of idle aims and misspent hours ,</docDate>
    <docTitle><titlePart>The eye can note one sacred spot By Pride and Self profaned not , A green place in the waste of thought , Where deed or word hath rendered less The sum of human wretchedness , And Gratitude looks forth to bless ; The simple burst of tenderest feeling From sad hearts worn by evil-dealing , For blessing on the hand of healing ; Better than Glory 's pomp will be That green and blessed spot to me , A palm-shade in Eternity ! Something of Time which may invite The purified and spiritual sight To rest on with a calm delight . And when the summer winds shall sweep With their light wings my place of sleep , And mosses round my headstone creep ; If still , as Freedom 's rallying sign , Upon the young heart 's altars shine The very fires they caught from mine ; If words my lips once uttered still , In the calm faith and steadfast will Of other hearts , their work fulfil ; Perchance with joy the soul may learn These tokens , and its eye discern The fires which on those altars burn ; A marvellous joy that even then , The spirit hath its life again , In the strong hearts of mortal men . Take , lady , then , the gift I bring , No gay and graceful offering , No flower-smile of the laughing spring . Midst the green buds of Youth 's fresh May , With Fancy 's leaf-enwoven bay , My sad and sombre gift I lay . And if it deepens in thy mind A sense of suffering human-kind ,— The outcast and the spirit-blind ; Oppressed and spoiled on every side , By Prejudice , and Scorn , and Pride , Life 's common courtesies denied ; Sad mothers mourning o'er their trust , Children by want and misery nursed , Tasting life 's bitter cup at first ; If to their strong appeals which come From fireless hearth , and crowded room , And the close alley 's noisome gloom ,— Though dark the hands upraised to thee In mute beseeching agony , Thou lend'st thy woman 's sympathy ;</titlePart></docTitle>
    <docDate>Not vainly on thy gentle shrine , Where Love , and Mirth , and Friendship twine Their varied gifts , I offer mine .<date>1843</date>. THE PUMPKIN . Oh , greenly and fair in the lands of the sun , The vines of the gourd and the rich melon run , And the rock and the tree and the cottage enfold , With broad leaves all greenness and blossoms all gold , Like that which o'er Nineveh 's prophet once grew , While he waited to know that his warning was true , And longed for the storm-cloud , and listened in vain For the rush of the whirlwind and red fire-rain . On the banks of the Xenil the dark Spanish maiden Comes up with the fruit of the tangled vine laden ; And the Creole of Cuba laughs out to behold Through orange-leaves shining the broad spheres of gold ; Yet with dearer delight from his home in the North , On the fields of his harvest the Yankee looks forth , Where crook-necks are coiling and yellow fruit shines , And the sun of September melts down on his vines . Ah ! on Thanksgiving day , when from East and from West , From North and from South come the pilgrim and guest , When the gray-haired New-Englander sees round his board The old broken links of affection restored , When the care-wearied man seeks his mother once more , And the worn matron smiles where the girl smiled before , What moistens the lip and what brightens the eye ? What calls back the past , like the rich Pumpkin pie ? Oh , fruit loved of boyhood ! the old days recalling , When wood-grapes were purpling and brown nuts were falling ! When wild , ugly faces we carved in its skin , Glaring out through the dark with a candle within ! When we laughed round the corn-heap , with hearts all in tune , Our chair a broad pumpkin ,— our lantern the moon , Telling tales of the fairy who travelled like steam , In a pumpkin-shell coach , with two rats for her team Then thanks for thy present ! none sweeter or better E'er smoked from an oven or circled a platter ! Fairer hands never wrought at a pastry more fine , Brighter eyes never watched o'er its baking , than thine ! And the prayer , which my mouth is too full to express , Swells my heart that thy shadow may never be less , That the days of thy lot may be lengthened below , And the fame of thy worth like a pumpkin-vine grow , And thy life be as sweet , and its last sunset sky Golden-tinted and fair as thy own Pumpkin pie !<date>1844</date>. FORGIVENESS . My heart was heavy , for its trust had been Abused , its kindness answered with foul wrong ; So , turning gloomily from my fellow-men , One summer Sabbath day I strolled among The green mounds of the village burial-place ; Where , pondering how all human love and hate Find one sad level ; and how , soon or late , Wronged and wrongdoer , each with meekened face , And cold hands folded over a still heart , Pass the green threshold of our common grave , Whither all footsteps tend , whence none depart , Awed for myself , and pitying my race , Our common sorrow , like a nighty wave , Swept all my pride away , and trembling I forgave !<date>1846</date>.</docDate>

   <div type="dedication">
    <p>TO MY SISTER , WITH A COPY OF “ THE SUPERNATURALISM OF NEW ENGLAND . ” The work referred to was a series of papers under this title , contributed to the Democratic Review and afterward collected into a volume , in which I noted some of the superstitions and folklore prevalent in New England . The volume has not been kept in print , but most of its contents are distributed in my Literary Recreations and Miscellanies . Dear Sister ! while the wise and sage Turn coldly from my playful page , And count it strange that ripened age Should stoop to boyhood 's folly ; I know that thou wilt judge aright Of all which makes the heart more light , Or lends one star-gleam to the night Of clouded Melancholy . Away with weary cares and themes ! Swing wide the moonlit gate of dreams ! Leave free once more the land which teems With wonders and romances Where thou , with clear discerning eyes , Shalt rightly read the truth which lies Beneath the quaintly masking guise Of wild and wizard fancies .</p>
   </div>
   <titlePage>
    <docTitle><titlePart>Lo ! once again our feet we set On still green wood-paths , twilight wet , By lonely brooks , whose waters fret The roots of spectral beeches ; Again the hearth-fire glimmers o'er Home 's whitewashed wall and painted floor , And young eyes widening to the lore Of faery-folks and witches . Dear heart ! the legend is not vain Which lights that holy hearth again , And calling back from care and pain , And death 's funereal sadness , Draws round its old familiar blaze The clustering groups of happier days , And lends to sober manhood 's gaze A glimpse of childish gladness .</titlePart></docTitle>
    <docDate>And , knowing how my life hath been A weary work of tongue and pen , A long , harsh strife with strong-willed men , Thou wilt not chide my turning To con , at times , an idle rhyme , To pluck a flower from childhood 's clime , Or listen , at Life 's noonday chime , For the sweet bells of Morning !<date>1847</date>. MY THANKS , ACCOMPANYING MANUSCRIPTS PRESENTED TO A FRIEND . ‘ T is said that in the Holy Land The angels of the place have blessed The pilgrim 's bed of desert sand , Like Jacob 's stone of rest . That down the hush of Syrian skies Some sweet-voiced saint at twilight sings The song whose holy symphonies Are beat by unseen wings ; Till starting from his sandy bed , The wayworn wanderer looks to see The halo of an angel 's head Shine through the tamarisk-tree . So through the shadows of my way Thy smile hath fallen soft and clear , So at the weary close of day Hath seemed thy voice of cheer . That pilgrim pressing to his goal May pause not for the vision 's sake , Yet all fair things within his soul The thought of it shall wake : The graceful palm-tree by the well , Seen on the far horizon 's rim ; The dark eyes of the fleet gazelle , Bent timidly on him ; Each pictured saint , whose golden hair Streams sunlike through the convent 's gloom ; Pale shrines of martyrs young and fair , And loving Mary 's tomb ; And thus each tint or shade which falls , From sunset cloud or waving tree , Along my pilgrim path , recalls The pleasant thought of thee . Of one in sun and shade the same , In weal and woe my steady friend , Whatever by that holy name The angels comprehend . Not blind to faults and follies , thou Hast never failed the good to see , Nor judged by one unseemly bough The upward-struggling tree . These light leaves at thy feet I lay ,— Poor common thoughts on common things , Which time is shaking , day by day , Like feathers from his wings ; Chance shootings from a frail life-tree , To nurturing care but little known , Their good was partly learned of thee , Their folly is my own . That tree still clasps the kindly mould , Its leaves still drink the twilight dew , And weaving its pale green with gold , Still shines the sunlight through . There still the morning zephyrs play , And there at times the spring bird sings , And mossy trunk and fading spray Are flowered with glossy wings . Yet , even in genial sun and rain , Root , branch , and leaflet fail and fade ; The wanderer on its lonely plain Erelong shall miss its shade . O friend beloved , whose curious skill Keeps bright the last year 's leaves and flowers , With warm , glad , summer thoughts to fill The cold , dark , winter hours Pressed on thy heart , the leaves I bring May well defy the wintry cold , Until , in Heaven 's eternal spring , Life 's fairer ones unfold .<date>1847</date>.</docDate>

       <l n="6">Kissed by strawberries on the hill ;</l>
       <l n="7">With the sunshine on thy face ,</l>
       <l n="8">Through thy torn brim 's jaunty grace ;</l>

       <l n="25">Flight of fowl and habitude</l>
       <l n="26">Of the tenants of the wood ;</l>
       <l n="27">How the tortoise bears his shell ,</l>

       <l n="76">Looped in many a wind-swung fold ;</l>
       <l n="77">While for music came the play</l>

       <l n="79">And , to light the noisy choir ,</l>
       <l n="80">Lit the fly his lamp of fire .</l>
