      <head>PREFACE</head>
      <p n="1">Of the miscellaneous collection of verse that follows , only four pieces have been published , though many were written long ago , and other partly written . In some few cases the verses were turned into prose and printed as such , it having been unanticipated at that time that they might see the light .</p>
     </div>

    <body>
     <p>Whenever an ancient and legitimate word of the district , for which there was no equivalent in received English , suggested itself as the most natural , nearest , and often only expression of a thought , it has been made use of , on what seemed good grounds .</p>
     <p>The pieces are in a large degree dramatic or personative in conception ; and this even where they are not obviously so .</p>
     <p>The dates attached to some of the poems do not apply to the rough sketches given in illustration , which have been recently made , and , as may be surmised , are inserted for personal and local reasons rather than for their intrinsic qualities .</p>
