    <head>PREFACE .</head>
    <p n="1">That Eve was Adam ’ s second wife was a common Rabbinic speculation . Certain commentators on Genesis adopted this view , to account for the double account of the creation of woman , in the sacred text , first in Genesis i . 27 , and second in Genesis xi . 18 . And they say that Adam ’ s first wife was named Lilith , but she was expelled from Eden , and after her expulsion Eve was created . Abraham Ecchelensis gives the following account of Lilith and her doings : “ There are some who do not regard spectres as simple devils , but suppose them to be of a mixed nature — part demoniacal , part human , and to have had their origin from Lilith , Adam ’ s first wife , by Eblis , prince of the devils . This fable has been transmitted to the Arabs , from Jewish sources , by some converts of Mohamet from Cabbalism and Rabbinism , who have transferred all the Jewish fooleries to the Arabs . They gave to Adam a wife formed of clay , along with Adam , and called her Lilith , resting on the Scripture : ‘ Male and female created He them .’”— Legends of the Patriarchs and Prophets .— Baring Gould .</p>
    <p n="2">Lilith or Lilis .— In the popular belief of the Hebrews , a female spectre in the shape of a finely dressed woman , who lies in wait for , and kills children . The old Rabbins turned Lilith into a wife of Adam , on whom he begat demons and who still has power to lie with men and kill children who are not protected by amulets with which the Jews of a yet later period supply themselves as a protection against her . Burton in his Anatomy of Melancholy tells us : “ The Talmudists say that Adam had a wife called Lilis , before he married Eve , and of her he begat nothing but devils .” A commentator on Skinner , quoted in the Encyclopædia Metropolitana , says that the English word Lullaby is derived from Lilla , abi ( begone , Lilith ) ! In the demonology of the Middle Ages , Lilis was a famous witch , and is introduced as such in the Walpurgis night scene in Goethe ’ s “ Faust .”— Webster ’ s Dictionary .</p>
    <p n="3">Our word Lullaby is derived from two Arabic words which mean “ Beware of Lilith !”— Anon .</p>
    <p n="4">Lilith , the supposed wife of Adam , after she married Eblis , is said to have ruled over the city of Damascus .— Legends of the Patriarchs and Prophets .— Baring Gould .</p>
    <p n="5">From these few and meagre details of a fabled existence , which are all that the author has been able to collect from any source whatever , has sprung the following poem . The poet feels quite justified in dissenting from the statements made in the preceding extracts , and has not drawn Lilith as there represented — the bloodthirsty sovereign who ruled Damascus , the betrayer of men , the murderer of children . The Lilith of the poem is transferred to the more beautiful shadow-world . To that country which is the abode of poets themselves . And about her is wrapt the humanizing element still , and everywhere embodied in the sweetest word the human tongue can utter — lullaby . Some critics declare that true literary art inculcates a lofty lesson — has a high moral purpose . If poets and their work must fall under this rigorous rule , then alas “ Lilith ” will knock at the door of public opinion with a trembling hand indeed . If the poem have either moral aim or lesson of any kind ( which observe , gentle critic , it is by no means asserted that it has ) , it is simply to show that the strongest intellectual powers contain no elements adverse to the highest and purest exercise of the affectional nature . That , in its true condition , the noblest , the most cultured intellect , and the loveliest , sublimest moral and emotional qualities , together weave the web that clothes the world ’ s great soul with imperishable beauty . The possessor of highest intellectual capacity will be also capable of highest developments in the latter qualities . The woman of true intellect is the woman of truest affection . For the rest let Lilith speak , whose life dropped unrecorded from the earliest world . It is the poet ’ s hope that the chords of the mother-heart universal will respond to the song of the childless one . That in the survival of that one word lullaby , may be revivified the pathetic figure of one whose home , whose hope , whose Eden passed to another . Whose name living in the terrors of superstitious peoples , now lingers in Earth ’ s sweetest utterance . That Pagan Lilith , re-baptized in the pure waters of maternal love , shall breathe to heathen and Christian motherhood alike , that most sacred love of Earth still throbbing through its tender lullaby .</p>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Broideries and ancient stuffs that some queen</l>
     <l n="2">Wore ; nor gems that warriors ’ hilts encrusted ;</l>
     <l n="3">Nor fresh from heroes ’ brows the laurels green ;</l>
     <l n="4">Nor bright sheaves by bards of eld entrusted</l>
     <l n="5">To earth ’ s great granaries — I bring not these .</l>
     <l n="6">Only thin , scattered blades from harvests gleaned</l>
     <l n="7">Erewhile I plucked , may happen thee to please .</l>
     <l n="8">So poor indeed , those others had demeaned</l>
     <l n="9">Themselves to cull ; or from their strong , firm hands</l>
     <l n="10">Down dropped about their feet with careless laugh ,</l>
     <l n="11">Too broken for home gathering , these strands ,</l>
     <l n="12">Or else more useless than the idle chaff .</l>
     <l n="13">But I have garnered them . Yet , lest they seem</l>
     <l n="14">Unworthy , and so shame Love ’ s offering ,</l>
     <l n="15">Amid the loose-bound sheaf stray flowers gleam .</l>
     <l n="16">And fairer seeming make the gift I bring ,</l>
     <l n="17">Lilies blood-red , that lit the waving field ,</l>
     <l n="18">And now are knotted through the golden grain .</l>
     <l n="19">Thou wilt not scorn the tribute I now yield ,</l>
     <l n="20">Nor even deem the foolish flowers vain .</l>
     <l n="21">So take it , and if still too slight , too small</l>
     <l n="22">It seem , think ’ tis a bloom that grew anear ,</l>
     <l n="23">In other Springtime , the old garden wall .</l>
     <l n="24">( That pale blue flower you will remember , dear .</l>
     <l n="25">The heedless world , unseeing , passed it by ,</l>
     <l n="26">And left it to the bee and you . ) Then say ,</l>
     <l n="27">“ Because the hands that tended it are nigh</l>
     <l n="28">No more , and little feet are gone away</l>
     <l n="29">That round it trampled down the beaded grass ,</l>
     <l n="30">Sweeter to me it is than musky spray</l>
     <l n="31">Of Southland ; and dearer than days that pass</l>
     <l n="32">In other summer-tides .” This simple song</l>
     <l n="33">Read so , dear heart ; Nay , rather white-souled one ,</l>
     <l n="34">Think ’ tis an olden echo , wandered long</l>
     <l n="35">From a low bed where ’ neath the westering sun</l>
     <l n="36">You sang . And if your lone heart ever said</l>
     <l n="37">“ Lo , she is gone , and cannot more be mine ,”</l>
     <l n="38">Say now , “ She is not changed — she is not wed ,—</l>
     <l n="39">She never left her cradle bed . Still shine</l>
     <l n="40">The pillows with the print of her wee head .”</l>
     <l n="41">So , mother-heart , this song , where through still rings</l>
     <l n="42">The strain you sang above my baby bed ,</l>
     <l n="43">I bring . An idle gift mayhap , that clings</l>
     <l n="44">About old days forgotten long , and dead .</l>
     <l n="45">This loitering tale , Valeria , take .</l>
     <l n="46">Perchance ’ tis sad , and hath not any mirth ,</l>
     <l n="47">Yet love thou it , for the weak singer ’ s sake ,</l>
     <l n="48">And hold it dear , though yet is little worth ,</l>
     <l n="49">This tale of Elder-world : of earth ’ s first prime ,</l>
     <l n="50">Of years that in their grave so long have lain ,</l>
     <l n="51">To-day ’ s dull ear , through poets ’ tuneful rhyme</l>
     <l n="52">No echo hears , nor mocking friar ’ s strain .</l>

   <lg type="poem">
    <head>BOOK I .</head>
     <l n="1">Pure as an angel ’ s dream shone Paradise .</l>
     <l n="2">Blue mountains hemmed it round ; and airy sighs</l>
     <l n="3">Of rippling waters haunted it . Dim glades ,</l>
     <l n="4">And wayward paths o ’ erflecked with shimmering shades ,</l>
     <l n="5">And tangled dells , and wilding pleasances ,</l>
     <l n="6">Hung moist with odors strange from scented trees .</l>
     <l n="7">Sweet sounds o ’ erbrimmed the place ; and rare perfumes ,</l>
     <l n="8">Faint as far sunshine , fell ’ mong verdant glooms .</l>
     <l n="9">In that fair land , all hues , all leafage green</l>
     <l n="10">Wrapt flawless days in endless summer-sheen .</l>
     <l n="11">Bright eyes , the violet waking , lifted up</l>
     <l n="12">Where bent the lily her deep , fragrant cup ;</l>
     <l n="13">And folded buds , ’ gainst many a leafy spray —</l>
     <l n="14">The wild-woods ’ voiceless nuns — knelt down to pray .</l>
     <l n="15">There roses , deep in greenest mosses swathed ,</l>
     <l n="16">Kept happy tryst with tropic blooms , sun-bathed .</l>
     <l n="17">No sounds of sadness surged through listening trees :</l>
     <l n="18">The waters babbled low ; the errant bees</l>
     <l n="19">Made answer , murmurous ; nor paled the hue</l>
     <l n="20">The jonquils wore ; nor chill the wild breath grew</l>
     <l n="21">Of daisies clustered white in dewy croft ;</l>
     <l n="22">Nor fell the tasseled plumes as satin soft</l>
     <l n="23">Upon the broad-leaved corn . Sweet all the day</l>
     <l n="24">O ’ erflowed with music every woodland way ;</l>
     <l n="25">And sweet the jargonings of nested bird ,</l>
     <l n="26">When light the listless wind the forest stirred .</l>
     <l n="27">Straight as the shaft that ’ gainst the morning sun</l>
     <l n="28">The slender palm uprears , the Fairest one —</l>
     <l n="29">The first of womankind — sweet Lilith — stood ,</l>
     <l n="30">A gracious shape that glorified the wood .</l>
     <l n="31">About her rounded shoulders warm and bare ,</l>
     <l n="32">Like netted sunshine fell her lustrous hair ;</l>
     <l n="33">The rosy flush of young pomegranate bells</l>
     <l n="34">Dawned on her cheeks ; and blue as in lone dells</l>
     <l n="35">Sleep the Forget-me-nots , her eyes . With bent</l>
     <l n="36">Brows , sullen-creased , swart Adam gazed intent</l>
     <l n="37">Upon a leopard , crouched low in its place</l>
     <l n="38">Beneath his feet . Not once in Lilith ’ s face</l>
     <l n="39">He looked , nor sought her wistful , downcast eyes</l>
     <l n="40">With shifting shadows dusk , and strange surprise .</l>
     <l n="41">“ O , Love ,” she said , “ no more let us contend !</l>
     <l n="42">So sweet is life , anger , methinks , should end .</l>
     <l n="43">In this , our garden bright , why dost thou claim</l>
     <l n="44">Ever the highest place , the noblest name ?</l>
     <l n="45">Freely to both our Lord gave self-same sway</l>
     <l n="46">O ’ er living things . Love , thou art gone astray !</l>
     <l n="47">Twin-born , of equal stature , kindred soul</l>
     <l n="48">Are we ; like dowed with strength . Yon stars that roll</l>
     <l n="49">Their course above , down-looking on my face ,</l>
     <l n="50">See yours as fair ; in neither aught that ’ s base .</l>
     <l n="51">Thy wife , not handmaid I , yet thou dost say ,</l>
     <l n="52">‘ I first in Eden rule .’ Thou , then , hast sway .</l>
     <l n="53">Must I , my Adam , mutely follow thee ?</l>
     <l n="54">Run at thy bidding , crouch beside thy knee ?</l>
     <l n="55">Lift up ( when thou dost bid me ) timid eyes ?</l>
     <l n="56">Not so will Lilith dwell in Paradise .”</l>
     <l n="57">“ Mine own ,” Adam made answer soft , “’ twere best</l>
     <l n="58">Thou didst forget such ills in noontide rest .</l>
     <l n="59">Content I wake , the keeper of the place .</l>
     <l n="60">Of equal stature ? Yea ! Of self-same grace ?</l>
     <l n="61">Nay , Love ; recall those lately vanished eves ,</l>
     <l n="62">When we together plucked the plantain leaves ;</l>
     <l n="63">Yon leopard lowly stretched at my command</l>
     <l n="64">Its lazy length beneath my soothing hand .</l>
     <l n="65">At thee she snarled , disdaining half , to sheathe</l>
     <l n="66">’ Neath thy soft pleading eyes her milk-white teeth .</l>
     <l n="67">Oft , Love , in other times , in sheltered nook ,</l>
     <l n="68">We scattered pearly millet by the brook .</l>
     <l n="69">Lo thine lay barren in the sand . Quick mine</l>
     <l n="70">Upspringing sifts o ’ er pale blooms odors fine :</l>
     <l n="71">Hateful thy chidings grow ; each breeze doth bring</l>
     <l n="72">Ever thy plaints — thy fretful murmuring .</l>
     <l n="73">These many days I weary of thy sighs ;</l>
     <l n="74">Know , Lilith , I alone rule Paradise .”</l>
     <l n="75">Thereat he rose , and quick at every stride</l>
     <l n="76">The fawning leopard gambolled at his side .</l>
     <l n="77">So fell the first dark shadow of Earth ’ s strife .</l>
     <l n="78">With coming evil all the winds were rife .</l>
     <l n="79">Lone lay the land with sense of dull loss paled .</l>
     <l n="80">The days grew sick at heart ; the sunshine failed ;</l>
     <l n="81">And falling waters breathed in silvery moan</l>
     <l n="82">A hidden ail to starlit dells alone —</l>
     <l n="83">As sometimes you have seen , ’ neath household eaves ,</l>
     <l n="84">’ Mong scents of Springtime , in the budded leaves ,</l>
     <l n="85">The swallows circling blithe , with slant brown wing ,</l>
     <l n="86">Home-flying fleet , with tender chattering ,</l>
     <l n="87">And all the place o ’ errun with nested love —</l>
     <l n="88">So have you come , when leaves hung crisp above</l>
     <l n="89">The silent door . Yet not again , I ween ,</l>
     <l n="90">Those shining wings , cleaving the air , have seen</l>
     <l n="91">Nor heard the gladsome swallows twittering there —</l>
     <l n="92">Only the empty nests , low-hung and bare ,</l>
     <l n="93">Spake of the scattered brood .— So lonely were</l>
     <l n="94">To Lilith grown her once loved haunts . Nor fair</l>
     <l n="95">The starlit nights , slow-dropping fragrant dew ,</l>
     <l n="96">Nor the dim groves when dawn came shifting through .</l>
     <l n="97">Far ’ mong the hills the wood-doves ’ moan she heard ,</l>
     <l n="98">Or in some nearer copse , a startled bird ;</l>
     <l n="99">Or the white moonshine ’ mong green boughs o ’ erhead</l>
     <l n="100">Wrought her full heart to tears . “ Sweet peace ,” she said ,</l>
     <l n="101">“ Alas — lies slain !”</l>
     <l n="102">With musing worn , she brake</l>
     <l n="103">At last her silence , and to Adam spake :</l>
     <l n="104">“ Beyond these walls I know not what may be —</l>
     <l n="105">Islands low-fringed , or bare ; or tranquil sea ,</l>
     <l n="106">Spaces unpeopled , wastes of burning sands ,</l>
     <l n="107">Green-wooded belts , enclasping summer lands ,</l>
     <l n="108">Or realms of dusky pines , or wolds of snow ,</l>
     <l n="109">Or jagged ice-peaks wrapt in purple glow ,</l>
     <l n="110">Or shadowy oceans lapped in fadeless sheen —</l>
     <l n="111">Yet there were Paradise , were Lilith queen .</l>
     <l n="112">To dally with my lord I was not meant ;</l>
     <l n="113">To soothe his idle whims , above him bent ,</l>
     <l n="114">Warm in my milk-white arms , lull his repose ,</l>
     <l n="115">Nor deep in subtle kisses drown his woes .</l>
     <l n="116">Wherefore , since here no more dwells love , I fly</l>
     <l n="117">To seek my home in other lands . For why</l>
     <l n="118">Should Lilith wait since Adam ’ s empty state</l>
     <l n="119">More dear he holds than Lilith desolate ?”</l>
     <l n="120">But answer soft made Adam at the word ,</l>
     <l n="121">For faint his dying love , yet coldly stirred</l>
     <l n="122">Its ashen cerements : “ Nay , love , our home</l>
     <l n="123">Within these garden walls lies safe . Wouldst roam</l>
     <l n="124">Without ? Sweet peace , by loss , wilt thou restore</l>
     <l n="125">One little loss , or miss it evermore ?”</l>
     <l n="126">“ In goodly Eden , Adam , safely bide ,</l>
     <l n="127">But I , for peace , nor love , nor life ,” she cried ,</l>
     <l n="128">“ Submit to thee . Unto our Lord I own</l>
     <l n="129">Allegiance true ; my homage his alone .</l>
     <l n="130">Oft have I watched the mists athwart yon peaks ,</l>
     <l n="131">Pursuing oft past coves and winding creeks ,</l>
     <l n="132">Have thought to touch their shining veil outspread ,</l>
     <l n="133">In happy days ere Love , alas , was dead ;</l>
     <l n="134">So now , farewell ! Ere the new day shall break</l>
     <l n="135">Adown their gleaming track , my way I take .”</l>
     <l n="136">She turned ; but ere the gate that looked without</l>
     <l n="137">She reached , one fleeting moment paused in doubt</l>
     <l n="138">Upon a river ’ s brink . In one swift glance</l>
     <l n="139">All coming time she saw . A weird romance</l>
     <l n="140">Wherein she traced great peoples yet unborn ,</l>
     <l n="141">New springing cycles , strange lands cleft with tarn</l>
     <l n="142">Or pleasant vale , and green plains stretching far ,</l>
     <l n="143">And quiet bays , and many a shingly bar ,</l>
     <l n="144">And troubled seas , with bitter perils past ,</l>
     <l n="145">And elfin shapes that jeering flitted fast</l>
     <l n="146">With scornful faces , leering lips that smiled ,</l>
     <l n="147">Or bursts of laughter through that vision wild .</l>
     <l n="148">Uncertain , then , she stood , half loth to turn .</l>
     <l n="149">“ Against yon deepening sky , how dimly burn</l>
     <l n="150">The stars , new-lit . Dear home , thou art so fair !”</l>
     <l n="151">She fondly sighed .</l>
     <l n="152">Then sudden she was ’ ware</l>
     <l n="153">The angel near her paused , whose watchful care</l>
     <l n="154">Guards Eden ’ s peaceful bounds . Serene , his air</l>
     <l n="155">So tender-sweet , so pure the gentle face ,</l>
     <l n="156">She scarce dared look upon its subtle grace .</l>
     <l n="157">Sad were his eyes ; his words , rebuking , fell</l>
     <l n="158">Soft as the moonshine clear , in sleeping dell .</l>
     <l n="159">“ My sister , go not hence , lest these gates bar</l>
     <l n="160">Lilith forever out . From peace afar ,</l>
     <l n="161">Anger and pride shall lead through distant ways</l>
     <l n="162">Thy feet reluctant , in the evil days .</l>
     <l n="163">All is decreed . At yonder southern gate</l>
     <l n="164">Behold ! waits even now my princely mate .</l>
     <l n="165">Thou can ’ st not tell which hath in our far land</l>
     <l n="166">The highest place . Nay ; nor , indeed , whose hand</l>
     <l n="167">Hath grasped the noblest fame ; nor yet divine</l>
     <l n="168">Whose brows enwound with honor , brightest shine .</l>
     <l n="169">In pleasant labor lurks no thought of pain ;</l>
     <l n="170">The greatest loss oft brings the noblest gain ;</l>
     <l n="171">The heart ’ s warm pulse feels not one throb of strife ,</l>
     <l n="172">And Love is holiest crown of human life .</l>
     <l n="173">Ere thou didst sleep , beyond the rim of night</l>
     <l n="174">I heard a voice that sang . The carol light ,</l>
     <l n="175">Scarce earth-born seemed . So sweet the matchless strain ,</l>
     <l n="176">Its cadence weird , lowly to breathe again ,</l>
     <l n="177">Wrapt echo , listening , half forgot ; and o ’ er</l>
     <l n="178">And o ’ er , as joyous birds unprisoned soar ,</l>
     <l n="179">The free notes rose . And in the silence wide ,</l>
     <l n="180">Across the seas , across the night , I cried :</l>
     <l n="181">O sinless soul , whose clear voice blithely rings</l>
     <l n="182">’ Gainst the blue verge of stars ! ’ Tis Lilith sings</l>
     <l n="183">The happy song of love . O Love ! the tint</l>
     <l n="184">Of light divine thou wearest . Thou hast no hint</l>
     <l n="185">Of storm or turmoil , or of Sin ’ s rough ways ,</l>
     <l n="186">Whose feet to heaven climb , through darkest maze .</l>
     <l n="187">Ah , Lilith , sure the love that basely weighs ,</l>
     <l n="188">That stoops to count its gifts , and hoarding , says ,</l>
     <l n="189">‘ Such and so many , these indeed are mine ;</l>
     <l n="190">I hold my treasure dear , nor covet thine ;’</l>
     <l n="191">This is not love ; ’ tis Thrift in borrowed dress ,</l>
     <l n="192">Deceiving thee . Love giveth free largess</l>
     <l n="193">With open hand , clean as the whitest day ;</l>
     <l n="194">Yea , that it gave , forgetteth it straightway .</l>
     <l n="195">Beyond these walls dwells bliss that lives not here ?</l>
     <l n="196">When thou hast bartered peace , outshining clear</l>
     <l n="197">And storm-tossed wide , art wildly driven hence ,</l>
     <l n="198">The outer world gives thee no recompense .</l>
     <l n="199">Each shining sphere that trembles in blue space</l>
     <l n="200">Hath orbit true — its own familiar place .</l>
     <l n="201">Nor doth the planet pale that gems the night</l>
     <l n="202">Reel wanton down , the smallest star to smite .</l>
     <l n="203">No twining vine , tendril , or springing shoot</l>
     <l n="204">Ere taught thee so ; for bud and leaf and root</l>
     <l n="205">Doth its best self lift upward into light ,</l>
     <l n="206">Yet climbing still , scorns not the sacred right</l>
     <l n="207">That shrines its fellow .</l>
     <l n="208">“ So pattering rains</l>
     <l n="209">The dark roots drink — and healthful juice slow drains</l>
     <l n="210">Deep ’ neath the mould ; and with their secret toil</l>
     <l n="211">Bear stainless , leaf and flow ’ r above the soil .</l>
     <l n="212">Noblest the soul that self hath most forgot ;</l>
     <l n="213">Strongest the self which hath most humbly wrought ;</l>
     <l n="214">Purest the soul that in full light serene ,</l>
     <l n="215">Unquestioning , enwrapt , God ’ s field doth glean .</l>
     <l n="216">I have seen worlds far hence ; thy tender feet</l>
     <l n="217">Bleeding , will tread their stony ways . And sweet</l>
     <l n="218">Is love . And wedded love , grown cold and rude ,</l>
     <l n="219">More bitter-seeming makes dull solitude .</l>
     <l n="220">Security is sweet ; and light and warm</l>
     <l n="221">The young heart beats , close shut from every harm .”</l>
     <l n="222">“ Yet ,” Lilith answered slow , “ in that still night</l>
     <l n="223">Ere He , the garden ’ s Lord , passed from our sight ,</l>
     <l n="224">Hast thou forgot his words ? ‘ Lo this fair spot</l>
     <l n="225">Made for your pleasance ; see ye mar it not ,</l>
     <l n="226">Oh , twin-born pair ! So richly dight with grace</l>
     <l n="227">Of soul and stature ; unto whom the place</l>
     <l n="228">I give . Together rule . Bear equal sway</l>
     <l n="229">O ’ er all that live herein .’ Hath Lilith sought</l>
     <l n="230">A solitary reign ? Hath she in aught</l>
     <l n="231">Offended ? Nay ; ’ tis Adam who doth break</l>
     <l n="232">The compact . Therefore , unhindered let me take</l>
     <l n="233">My way far hence . I shall not vex his soul</l>
     <l n="234">With fretful plaints , where unknown stars shall roll ,</l>
     <l n="235">Far , far away ,” she sighed .</l>
     <l n="236">“ Yet ere these bounds</l>
     <l n="237">Thy feet pass , linger . Lilith , list glad sounds</l>
     <l n="238">That greet thine ear . Slow cycles will pass on</l>
     <l n="239">And in the time-to-be-bright years , grow wan ;</l>
     <l n="240">Old planets fade , new stars shall dimly burn ,</l>
     <l n="241">But not to Eden ’ s peace shalt thou return .</l>
     <l n="242">Oft from thy yearning heart glad hope shall fail .</l>
     <l n="243">Thy fruit of life lift bloom all sere and pale .</l>
     <l n="244">Certain , small comfort bides , when joy is gone ,</l>
     <l n="245">In Great or Less . Grim Sorrow waits to lead thee on .</l>
     <l n="246">Sorrow ! Thou hast not seen her pallid face .</l>
     <l n="247">In thy most troubled dream she had no place ”—</l>
     <l n="248">“ Nay , I depart ,” she said , with lips grown chill .</l>
     <l n="249">“ Fearless and free , exiled , but princess still .”</l>
     <l n="250">“ I may not hinder thee ,” the Angel sighed ;</l>
     <l n="251">“ No soul unwilling here may ever bide .”</l>
     <l n="252">Slow swung the verdant gates neath saddest eyes .</l>
     <l n="253">Lilith forever lost fair Paradise .</l>

     <l n="1">Soft stealing through the shade , and skirting swift</l>
     <l n="2">The walls of Paradise , through night ’ s dark rift</l>
     <l n="3">Lilith fled far ; nor stopped lest deadly snare</l>
     <l n="4">Or peril by the wayside lurked .</l>
     <l n="5">The air</l>
     <l n="6">Grew chill . Loud beat her heart , as through the wind</l>
     <l n="7">Echoed , unseen , pursuing feet , behind .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="8">Adown the pathway of the mist she passed ,</l>
     <l n="9">And reached a weird , strange land at last .</l>
     <l n="10">When morning flecked the dappled sky with red ,</l>
     <l n="11">And odors sweet from waking flowers were shed ,</l>
     <l n="12">Lilith beheld a plain , outstretching wide ,</l>
     <l n="13">With distant mountains seamed .</l>
     <l n="14">Afar , a silvery tide</l>
     <l n="15">The blue shore kissed . And in that tropic glow</l>
     <l n="16">Dim islands shone , palm-fringed , and low .</l>
     <l n="17">In nearer space , like scarlet arrows flew</l>
     <l n="18">Strange birds , or ’ mong the reedy fens , or through</l>
     <l n="19">Tall trees , of unknown leafage , glancing , went .</l>
     <l n="20">Now Lilith seaward passed , and stooping , bent</l>
     <l n="21">Her hollowed hand above the wave , and quaffed ;</l>
     <l n="22">For she was spent with wanderings wide . Loud laughed</l>
     <l n="23">She then , beholding on that silent shore</l>
     <l n="24">Rare shells , that still faint in their pink lips bore</l>
     <l n="25">Wild ocean-songs ; and precious stones , that bright</l>
     <l n="26">That dim sea ’ s marge , deep in the land of night</l>
     <l n="27">Thick strewed .</l>
     <l n="28">Then glad , she lifted shining eyes ,</l>
     <l n="29">Loud crying there , “ O Lilith , now arise ,</l>
     <l n="30">Great queen-triumphant ! See how wildly fair</l>
     <l n="31">Before me lies my realm ! And from its air</l>
     <l n="32">Soft , sensuous , new life as ruddy wine ,</l>
     <l n="33">My spirit drinks . Nor beauty so divine</l>
     <l n="34">Hath Eden ’ s self . Look , where upon the sands</l>
     <l n="35">The garish mosses spread with dainty hands ,</l>
     <l n="36">Like goblin network fine , each fairy frond .</l>
     <l n="37">And dusky trees shut in broad fields beyond ,</l>
     <l n="38">And hang long trembling garlands , age-grown-gray ,</l>
     <l n="39">From topmost boughs adown , athwart the day ;</l>
     <l n="40">And sweet amid these wilds , bright dewy bells</l>
     <l n="41">Ring summer chimes . And soft in fragrant dells ,</l>
     <l n="42">’ Mong tender leaves , great spikes of scarlet flaunt</l>
     <l n="43">About the pools — the errant wild bees ’ haunt —</l>
     <l n="44">And thick with bramble-blooms pink petals starred ,</l>
     <l n="45">And dew-stained buds of blue , the velvet sward .</l>
     <l n="46">Scarce ripple stirred the sea ; and inland wend</l>
     <l n="47">Far bays and sedgy ponds ; and rolling rivers bend .</l>
     <l n="48">A land of leaf and fruitage in the glow</l>
     <l n="49">Of palest glamours steeped . And far and low</l>
     <l n="50">Great purple isles ; and further still a rim</l>
     <l n="51">Of sunset-tinted hills , that softly dim</l>
     <l n="52">Shine ’ gainst the day . “ O world , new found ,” she said ,</l>
     <l n="53">“ With treasures heaped and odors rare , ’ mong flowers shed ,</l>
     <l n="54">For whose dear sake I came o ’ er flinty ways ,</l>
     <l n="55">And paths with danger fraught ; ’ mong brambly sprays ,</l>
     <l n="56">With bleeding feet , and shoulders thorn-pierced deep .</l>
     <l n="57">But perils past , fade fast . And I will weep</l>
     <l n="58">My Eden lost no more .” And sweet and low</l>
     <l n="59">As one who dreams , she said , “ For now I know</l>
     <l n="60">These mountain heights , these level plains , are mine .”</l>
     <l n="61">She ceased , and inland quickly turned . “ Fair shine</l>
     <l n="62">Strange fruits thick-set , or blossoms lightly tossed</l>
     <l n="63">Low at my feet .” Therewith , a dusk globe , crossed</l>
     <l n="64">With golden bands , from bent boughs , stripped she . Through</l>
     <l n="65">The gleaming sphere its nectrous juices drew ,</l>
     <l n="66">And thirsting cried — as one grown drunken : “ Mine</l>
     <l n="67">These fruits unknown , in thorny combs that shine ,</l>
     <l n="68">Or gray-green spikes that glow , dull on the sands .</l>
     <l n="69">Fain would I pluck , out-reaching eager hands ,</l>
     <l n="70">Save that a marvel grows of ruddier rind</l>
     <l n="71">Out-flinging fruity breath upon the wind ,</l>
     <l n="72">Beneath harsh spines half-hid . Nor drains</l>
     <l n="73">My wilful spouse such nectars fine . Nor gains</l>
     <l n="74">His patient care the fruitage rare , these plains</l>
     <l n="75">That heaps unheeded . Nay , nor bearded grains</l>
     <l n="76">Golding this goodly land , where Lilith reigns .”</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="77">So passed the glad years on , and o ’ er her home —</l>
     <l n="78">Its woods and mountains , its clear streams — to roam ,</l>
     <l n="79">She loved . The inmost throb of Nature ’ s heart</l>
     <l n="80">She felt amid the grass . Each daintiest part</l>
     <l n="81">Of Nature ’ s work she knew ; each gain , each loss .</l>
     <l n="82">And reverent watched on high the starry cross</l>
     <l n="83">Gleaming , mute symbol in that southern dome</l>
     <l n="84">Of One — the Promised One — of days to come .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="85">The rifted sea-shell on the shingly beach</l>
     <l n="86">She scanned , pitying each inmate gone . Each</l>
     <l n="87">Named . ’ Mong beetling crags , the sea-bird ’ s home ,</l>
     <l n="88">Light-footed , went . Or , idly , in the foam</l>
     <l n="89">Under the cocoa-palms , her fingers dipped ,</l>
     <l n="90">Much marveling to see where featly slipped</l>
     <l n="91">Beneath the waves scaled creatures , crimson-dyed</l>
     <l n="92">Or luminous : Barred-yellow , purple pied ,</l>
     <l n="93">Rose-tinted , opaline , or dight with stain ,</l>
     <l n="94">Rich as the rainbow streaks , when through the rain</l>
     <l n="95">The Sun ’ s kiss falls . Much wondered she when bright</l>
     <l n="96">By sedgy pools , flamingoes stalked . And light</l>
     <l n="97">The startled ostrich bent his headlong flight</l>
     <l n="98">O ’ er desert bare . And on the woody height</l>
     <l n="99">Trooped zebras , velvet-brown . The date ’ s green crest</l>
     <l n="100">Beneath , the peaceful camels lay at rest .</l>
     <l n="101">And slender-straight camelopards the boughs</l>
     <l n="102">Down-drew , the lush-green leaves thereon to browse .</l>
     <l n="103">Or oft ’ mong oozy bogs , or through the fens ,</l>
     <l n="104">Fearless she went , when low , ’ mong reedy dens</l>
     <l n="105">The water-courses by , huge creatures slept ,</l>
     <l n="106">Or in the jungles spotted panthers crept ,</l>
     <l n="107">And in the thickets deadly serpents wound</l>
     <l n="108">Like blossomed wreaths , their coils upon the ground .</l>
     <l n="109">All forms of life she saw ; with tenderest care</l>
     <l n="110">Uplifting humblest sprays , or blooms most rare .</l>
     <l n="111">Pierced the deep heart of Nature ’ s subtlest lore ,</l>
     <l n="112">Touched highest knowledge , probed the inmost core</l>
     <l n="113">Of hidden things . She tracked each circling world</l>
     <l n="114">And the wide sweep of billows lightly curled .</l>
     <l n="115">Each page the Master writ she read , close furled</l>
     <l n="116">In lotus blooms , or , ’ mong the storm-clouds whirled ;</l>
     <l n="117">Or traced , star-lettered , on the flaming scroll</l>
     <l n="118">The night unwinds toward the southern pole .</l>
     <l n="119">And sometimes wiling idle days , she wove</l>
     <l n="120">In quaint device , gems from her treasure-trove ,</l>
     <l n="121">Rare garlanded , or set in flashing zone</l>
     <l n="122">Soft emerald , sapphire pale , and many a stone</l>
     <l n="123">Out-gleaming amethyst . Her yellow hair</l>
     <l n="124">Among , the glinting diamonds shone . And there</l>
     <l n="125">The sultry topaz burned . And laughing , twined</l>
     <l n="126">She round her bare white throat red rubies shrined</l>
     <l n="127">In pearls .</l>
     <l n="128">Or she among the haunts would rove</l>
     <l n="129">That sheltered island birds ; or in the grove ,</l>
     <l n="130">Or ’ mong the rocky cliffs , where dainty nests</l>
     <l n="131">They fashioned swift . She scaled the seaward crests ,</l>
     <l n="132">And on the sands piled turtle eggs , when all</l>
     <l n="133">About hoarse-shrieked the water-fowl , or call</l>
     <l n="134">Of plovers fell among the tangled glens ,</l>
     <l n="135">Or lonely bitterns ’ boom came o ’ er the fens .</l>
     <l n="136">So traversed she her realm , when mangoes green</l>
     <l n="137">Baobabs by , showed freshest hues ; and sheen</l>
     <l n="138">Of silver touched acacias slight ; and lone</l>
     <l n="139">The solitary aloes , dreamed . The moan</l>
     <l n="140">Of that far sea against the shore brake soft .</l>
     <l n="141">And through that blossom-burdened land as oft</l>
     <l n="142">She roamed and far , sweet sped the passing days .</l>
     <l n="143">Till one dawned fairest , in whose noon-tide haze</l>
     <l n="144">Sweet slumbering she lay ; and dreamed-steeped still ,</l>
     <l n="145">Half conscious , caught the tinkle of a rill</l>
     <l n="146">In far-off Paradise . More silver clear</l>
     <l n="147">Across her thoughts , as once she loved to hear ,</l>
     <l n="148">Rippled the waters , low against the stones</l>
     <l n="149">Where poised gemmed dragon-flies ; and sudden moans</l>
     <l n="150">Shook ’ mong blue flags . Waked , vague unrest</l>
     <l n="151">And tender yearning rose within her breast ,</l>
     <l n="152">And longing love , that she ne ’ er more might still .</l>
     <l n="153">When late upon her parting day smiled chill ,</l>
     <l n="154">Pensive she gazed upon the darkling land ,</l>
     <l n="155">With lingering feet o ’ er-passed the shining strand ,</l>
     <l n="156">And silent sat on an o ’ erhanging ledge ,</l>
     <l n="157">The sea o ’ erlooking . Far the horizon ’ s edge</l>
     <l n="158">Athwart her gaze a rim of blue hills cleft ,</l>
     <l n="159">Whereat she sighed . “ So rose , ere I them left ,</l>
     <l n="160">So smiled , the dim hills round my Eden home .</l>
     <l n="161">But I — wherefore recall , when far I roam ,</l>
     <l n="162">Dreams vanished — gone ? And now since long time dead</l>
     <l n="163">Is that fair past , I fain would lay it low</l>
     <l n="164">Where soft about it memories sweet may blow</l>
     <l n="165">As summer winds the fallen leaves among .”</l>
     <l n="166">Then passed her tender thoughts , and loud and glad</l>
     <l n="167">As our morn wakens , strong that yesternight slept sad ,</l>
     <l n="168">She sang . The song triumphant upward swelled ,</l>
     <l n="169">Unsorrowed by soft dreams or thoughts of eld —</l>
     <l n="170">As fresh the full , free , mellow notes did rise</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Wide through her realm she walked , and glad or lorn</l>
     <l n="2">She mused . So , loitering , it chanced one morn</l>
     <l n="3">When lone she sat upon a mountain height ,</l>
     <l n="4">One sudden stood anear , whose dark eyes bright</l>
     <l n="5">Upon her shone . Pallid his face , and red</l>
     <l n="6">His smileless lips . “ Who art thou ?” Lilith said ,</l>
     <l n="7">And faint a hidden pain her hot heart stirred ,</l>
     <l n="8">When low , and rarely sweet , his voice she heard .</l>
     <l n="9">She looked , half-pleased — and half in strange surprise</l>
     <l n="10">Shrank ’ neath the gaze of those wild , starry eyes .</l>
     <l n="11">“ Oh , dame ,” the stranger said , “ where waters leap</l>
     <l n="12">Bright glancing down , I rested oft , where steep</l>
     <l n="13">Thy Eden o ’ er , bare-browed , a peak uprose .</l>
     <l n="14">Naught craving bloom or fruitage — nay , nor those</l>
     <l n="15">Frail joys Adam holds dear . One only boon</l>
     <l n="16">I sought of all his heritage . Fair ’ neath the moon</l>
     <l n="17">I saw thee stand ; and all about thy feet</l>
     <l n="18">The night her perfume spilled , soft incense meet .</l>
     <l n="19">Then low I sighed , when grew thy beauty on my sight ,</l>
     <l n="20">‘ Some comfort yet remains , if that I might</l>
     <l n="21">From Adam pluck this perfect flower . Some morn —</l>
     <l n="22">If I ( some dreamed-of morn , perchance slow-born )</l>
     <l n="23">This flawless bloom , white , fragrant , lustrous , pure</l>
     <l n="24">For ever on my breast might hold secure .’</l>
     <l n="25">Yea , for thy love , through darkling realms of night</l>
     <l n="26">I followed thee , sharing thy fearful flight</l>
     <l n="27">Unseen . Lo , when thy timid heart , behind</l>
     <l n="28">Heard echoing phantom feet upon the wind ,</l>
     <l n="29">’ Twas I , pursuing o ’ er the day ’ s last brink ;</l>
     <l n="30">Wherefore , I now am here . O Lilith , think</l>
     <l n="31">How over-much I love thee , and how sweet</l>
     <l n="32">Were life with thee ! O weary naked feet ,</l>
     <l n="33">With me each onward path wilt thou not tread ?</l>
     <l n="34">Or , if thou endest here thy quest ,” he said ,</l>
     <l n="35">“ Let me too bide with thee .”</l>
     <l n="36">Made answer low</l>
     <l n="37">Lilith thereto : “ Meseems not long ago</l>
     <l n="38">One stood at Eden ’ s gate like thee . But thy face</l>
     <l n="39">Is darker , red thy lips . Of kingly race</l>
     <l n="40">I know thee . Say , whence comest thou , O prince ?”</l>
     <l n="41">“ Nay , then ,” he sighed , “ an outcast I , long since</l>
     <l n="42">From Heaven thrust out ; yet now , the curse is past ,</l>
     <l n="43">Nor mourn I Heaven lost , if at the last</l>
     <l n="44">Thy love I win . Yea , where thou art , I know</l>
     <l n="45">Is Heaven . And bliss , in sooth ” ( oh , soft and low ,</l>
     <l n="46">He said ) , “ lives ever in thy smile .”</l>
     <l n="47">His speech</l>
     <l n="48">Thus ended . And toward the sandy beach</l>
     <l n="49">He passed . Though long her eyes the stranger sought</l>
     <l n="50">Where curved the distant shore , she saw him not .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="51">Soft through the trees the mottled shadows dropped</l>
     <l n="52">When Lilith in her pleasance sat . Half-propped</l>
     <l n="53">’ Gainst mossy trunk her slender length . Her hair</l>
     <l n="54">In sunny web , enmeshed her elbows bare .</l>
     <l n="55">Slowly the breeze swayed the mimosas slight</l>
     <l n="56">As Eblis pushed aside the bent boughs light .</l>
     <l n="57">“ O dame ,” he said , “ it seemeth surely meet</l>
     <l n="58">Earth ’ s richest gifts to lay at Lilith ’ s feet ;</l>
     <l n="59">Therefore I said ‘ unto the fairest one ,</l>
     <l n="60">Things loveliest beneath the shining sun</l>
     <l n="61">I bring .’ Since of all crafts in this young earth</l>
     <l n="62">I am true master , unto her whose worth</l>
     <l n="63">So much deserves , I bear this marble sphere ,</l>
     <l n="64">Whose hollowed husk , well polished , gleaming clear ,</l>
     <l n="65">Hides rarest fruit .” Therewith the globe he showed ,</l>
     <l n="66">The half whereof smooth-sparkling was : Half glowed</l>
     <l n="67">With carven work ; embossed with pale leaves light ,</l>
     <l n="68">And delicately sculptured birds in flight ,</l>
     <l n="69">And clustered flowers frail . Lilith drew near</l>
     <l n="70">With beaming eyes , and laid the graven sphere</l>
     <l n="71">Against her smiling lips ; o ’ ertraced the vine</l>
     <l n="72">That circled it with fingers slim . “ Mine , mine</l>
     <l n="73">Is it , O prince ?” she cried . “ I know not why</l>
     <l n="74">Its beauty doth recall the winds ’ long sigh</l>
     <l n="75">That surged among the palms . Methinks is dead</l>
     <l n="76">Some summer-tide , that in its own sweet stead</l>
     <l n="77">Hath left upon the stone its imaging .”</l>
     <l n="78">Eblis replied : “ On earth , is anything</l>
     <l n="79">More fair ? If such thou knowest , Lilith , speak .</l>
     <l n="80">That I , for thee , surely would straightway seek .</l>
     <l n="81">Say , if indeed thou findest anywhere ,</l>
     <l n="82">On land or sea , created things so rare ?”</l>
     <l n="83">And Lilith answered , “ On this earth so round ,</l>
     <l n="84">Naught else so lovely anywhere I found .</l>
     <l n="85">So shames it meaner work — so had I said —</l>
     <l n="86">But see yon nodding palm that droops its head</l>
     <l n="87">Low sighing o ’ er the wave . Bring me a bough</l>
     <l n="88">So feathery-fine . Turn thy white sphere ! Now</l>
     <l n="89">On its cold , fair surface , Eblis , canst thou</l>
     <l n="90">Such branches carve , or tender fronds , that we</l>
     <l n="91">Bright waving on the cocoa , these may see ?”</l>
     <l n="92">And Eblis wrought till grew upon the stone</l>
     <l n="93">Such airy boughs as on the cocoa shone .</l>
     <l n="94">Then Lilith cried : “ Skilled craftsman , proven thou !</l>
     <l n="95">Didst thou , then , make my cocoa-tree ? Thy bough</l>
     <l n="96">Pale graven give the grace of its green crown</l>
     <l n="97">When through it night winds gently slip adown .</l>
     <l n="98">No charm of color , nor of change , nor glow</l>
     <l n="99">Of blue noon sky , thy carven work doth show ;</l>
     <l n="100">Let dusk bees visit it — or sip the breath</l>
     <l n="101">From thy chill marble buds .” Then , Lilith saith ,</l>
     <l n="102">“ Eblis hath wroughten noblest on this earth .”</l>
     <l n="103">He answered quick , “ Poor bauble , little worth</l>
     <l n="104">To Lilith ! Ope thy slighted husk , reveal</l>
     <l n="105">The miracle thy rough rind doth conceal !”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="106">He touched a hidden spring , and wide apart</l>
     <l n="107">The riven sphere showed its white hollow heart ,</l>
     <l n="108">And in the midst a gem ; the which he laid</l>
     <l n="109">Within her hand . “ Behold ,” he said , “ I made</l>
     <l n="110">Most fair for thee this lustrous blood-red sard ,</l>
     <l n="111">And deftly traced its gleaming surface hard</l>
     <l n="112">With carvings thick of bright acacias slim ,</l>
     <l n="113">Pomegranates lush and river-reeds . Its rim</l>
     <l n="114">A spray of leaves enchased , white as with rime</l>
     <l n="115">Night fallen . ‘ Slow drags the lagging time ,’</l>
     <l n="116">I said , ‘ till one day shines upon the breast</l>
     <l n="117">Of her , whose perfect beauty worthiest</l>
     <l n="118">It decks , this gem .’ The token , Lilith , take ;</l>
     <l n="119">If lovelier there be , for Eblis ’ sake</l>
     <l n="120">Keep silent ; yet with me , oh Lilith , go</l>
     <l n="121">Awhile from thine own land . Then shall I know</l>
     <l n="122">The gem finds favor in thine eyes .”</l>
     <l n="123">Then she</l>
     <l n="124">Turned from her pleasance and all silently</l>
     <l n="125">Passed to the sea , across the yellow strand</l>
     <l n="126">That , glimmering , ringed her shadowy land .</l>
     <l n="127">“ Oh cool ,” he said , “ the lucent waves that fret</l>
     <l n="128">The barren shore , and curl their scattered spray wet</l>
     <l n="129">’ Gainst thy hand . Come ! my longing pinnace waits</l>
     <l n="130">To bear thee far . Her slender keel now grates</l>
     <l n="131">Upon the beach ; and swift her shapely prow</l>
     <l n="132">Will skim the deep , as swallows ’ fleet wing . Thou</l>
     <l n="133">Seest ! comely and strong it is . For thee</l>
     <l n="134">Its golden sails , its purple canopy .</l>
     <l n="135">With skin of spotted pard , I cushioned it .</l>
     <l n="136">Ere the fresh breeze doth die , light let us flit</l>
     <l n="137">Across the sea . No craft so proud , so staunch ,</l>
     <l n="138">Goes glancing through the foam . I safely launch</l>
     <l n="139">Her now , and speed to fairy isles . Come thou</l>
     <l n="140">With me .” And glad she crossed the burnished prow ;</l>
     <l n="141">And ’ mong the thick furred rugs sat down . “ Oh craft ,</l>
     <l n="142">Fair fashioned , lightly built , speed far ,” she laughed ;</l>
     <l n="143">“ To other lands bear Lilith safe .”</l>
     <l n="144">As sailed</l>
     <l n="145">They idly on , her slender hand she trailed</l>
     <l n="146">Among the waves , and sudden cried , “ Indeed ,</l>
     <l n="147">A craft stauncher than thine floats by . What need</l>
     <l n="148">Hath it of helm , or prow , or silken sail ,</l>
     <l n="149">Sure harbor finding when the ocean gale</l>
     <l n="150">Fast drives it onward ?” A nut she drew , round ,</l>
     <l n="151">Rough , coarse-husked , forth from the wave . “ Lo , I found ,”</l>
     <l n="152">She said , “ this boat well built . The cocoa-tree</l>
     <l n="153">Cast it amid the foam . Its pilot free ,</l>
     <l n="154">The summer wind ; its port , the misty shore</l>
     <l n="155">Of ocean isles . It fades from sight . ‘ No more ,’</l>
     <l n="156">We say , ‘ it sails the wild uncertain main ,’</l>
     <l n="157">But when the drifting days are gone , again</l>
     <l n="158">We turn our prow , and reach the barren isles</l>
     <l n="159">Where , stranded as we went , the nut . Now smiles</l>
     <l n="160">Above ; a bending tree . Aloud we cry ,</l>
     <l n="161">‘ A miracle is wrought !’ We draw anigh .</l>
     <l n="162">Behold , the cocoa , towering , doth spring</l>
     <l n="163">Forth from the brown nut ’ s heart . About it cling</l>
     <l n="164">Sweet odors faint ; and far stars trembling peep .</l>
     <l n="165">When through its bowers cool the breezes creep .</l>
     <l n="166">Strong , indeed , thy boat , well builded ! I wis</l>
     <l n="167">There be yet other craft as firm , Eblis ,</l>
     <l n="168">That o ’ er these trackless waters boldly glide .</l>
     <l n="169">Brave Nautilus afar , doth fearless ride ,</l>
     <l n="170">With sails of gossamer . So , too , doth spread ,</l>
     <l n="171">To summer airs , his silken gleaming thread ,</l>
     <l n="172">The water-spider fleet , free sailor true</l>
     <l n="173">That in the sunshine floats , beneath the blue ,</l>
     <l n="174">Glad skies . And through the deep , all sparkling , slip</l>
     <l n="175">A thousand insect-swarms , that , rippling , dip</l>
     <l n="176">Amid the merry waves . Bright voyagers</l>
     <l n="177">That roam the sultry seas ! Look , the wind stirs</l>
     <l n="178">Our creaking sails ! Thy pinnace flying o ’ er</l>
     <l n="179">The ocean ’ s swell , fast leaves the fading shore ;</l>
     <l n="180">Yet faster still the Nautilus sails by ,</l>
     <l n="181">And darts the spider quick . And swifter fly</l>
     <l n="182">The insect-fleets among the foam ; yet think</l>
     <l n="183">Not when among the billows wild doth sink</l>
     <l n="184">Thy bounding boat , I fear . Nor would I slight</l>
     <l n="185">Thy skill , that made it strong , and swift , and light ,</l>
     <l n="186">And trimmed it gayly , for my sake .”</l>
     <l n="187">Now near</l>
     <l n="188">A jutting shore Prince Eblis drew , where sheer</l>
     <l n="189">The brown rocks rose . And just beyond , a slim</l>
     <l n="190">Beach of white sand curved to the ocean ’ s brim .</l>
     <l n="191">Thereto he came , and high upon the strand</l>
     <l n="192">Drew the boat ’ s keel . “ Welcome , fair queen , to land</l>
     <l n="193">That Eblis rules ,” he said . “ I fain would show</l>
     <l n="194">Thee what thou hast not seen in the warm glow</l>
     <l n="195">Of thy glad home . This blighted shore of mine</l>
     <l n="196">No verdure hath , nor bloom , nor fruits that shine</l>
     <l n="197">’ Mong drooping boughs . Far inland gloom lone peaks</l>
     <l n="198">O ’ er blackened meads ; or from their bare cones leaps</l>
     <l n="199">Gaunt , crackling flame ; or crawl like ashen veins</l>
     <l n="200">The smouldering fires across the stricken plains .</l>
     <l n="201">Deep in these yawning caves black shadows lie</l>
     <l n="202">That shall be lifted never more . Come , I</l>
     <l n="203">Enter ! Know thou what treasure by the sea</l>
     <l n="204">I gathered other time .” Therewith showed he</l>
     <l n="205">Hid ’ mong the high heaped rocks a dusky grot</l>
     <l n="206">Where never sunshine fell . A dismal spot</l>
     <l n="207">Where dank the sea-weeds coiled and cold the air</l>
     <l n="208">Swept through . And stooping , Eblis downward rolled</l>
     <l n="209">Before her webs of woven stuff , in fold</l>
     <l n="210">Of purple sheen , enwrought with flecks of gold .</l>
     <l n="211">Great wefts of scarlet and of blue , thick strewn</l>
     <l n="212">With pearls , or cleft with discs of jacinth stone ;</l>
     <l n="213">And drifts of silky woof and samite white ,</l>
     <l n="214">And warps of Orient hues . Eblis light</l>
     <l n="215">Wound round her neck a scarf of amber . Wide</l>
     <l n="216">Its smooth folds sweeping flowed ; and proud he cried ,</l>
     <l n="217">“ Among these hills , in the still loom of night ,</l>
     <l n="218">I wrought for Lilith ’ s pleasing , all . And bright</l>
     <l n="219">Have spun these webs , in blended morning hues</l>
     <l n="220">And noontide shades and trail of silver dews —</l>
     <l n="221">Hereon have set fair traceries of cloud-shine</l>
     <l n="222">And tints of the far vales . The textures fine</l>
     <l n="223">Glow with sweet thoughts of thee . And otherwhere</l>
     <l n="224">Hast thou such fabrics seen , or colors rare</l>
     <l n="225">As these ?” Dawned in her eyes a swift delight ,</l>
     <l n="226">And low she cried , “ Oh , wondrous is the sight ,</l>
     <l n="227">And much it pleaseth me . But yet ,” she said ,</l>
     <l n="228">“ Beside my knee one morn , its hooded head</l>
     <l n="229">A Hagè reared . Its gliding shape so near</l>
     <l n="230">To subtler music moved , than my dull ear</l>
     <l n="231">Could catch . Its velvet skin I gently strake ,</l>
     <l n="232">Watching the light that o ’ er its heaped coils brake</l>
     <l n="233">In glittering waves . Within its small , wise glance ,</l>
     <l n="234">Flame silent slept , or quick in baleful dance</l>
     <l n="235">Before my startled gaze quivering did wake .</l>
     <l n="236">Fair is thy woof , soft woven , yet the snake</l>
     <l n="237">Out-dazzles it . The beetle that doth boom</l>
     <l n="238">Its dull life out among the tangled gloom ,</l>
     <l n="239">Lift his wide wing above thy weft , or trail</l>
     <l n="240">His splendor there , and thy poor web will pale ;</l>
     <l n="241">Yea , the red wayside lily that doth snare</l>
     <l n="242">The girdled bee , is softer still , more fair</l>
     <l n="243">Than finest woven cloth .” But tenderly</l>
     <l n="244">She smoothed the gleaming folds . “ Much pleaseth me ,</l>
     <l n="245">Natlhess ,” she said , “ such loveliness .” Then brought</l>
     <l n="246">He tapestries of fleeces fine , well wrought</l>
     <l n="247">In colors soft as woodland mosses ’ tinge ,</l>
     <l n="248">Or glow of autumn blooms : Heavy with fringe</l>
     <l n="249">Of downward sweeping gold ; arras , where through</l>
     <l n="250">Showed mottled stripes , or arabesques of blue ,</l>
     <l n="251">Broad zones of red , and tender grays , and hue</l>
     <l n="252">Of dropping leaves . “ Lilith ,” he said , “ when rolled</l>
     <l n="253">The storm-tossed billows round these caves , behold</l>
     <l n="254">I spun these daintily . ’ Twere hard to find</l>
     <l n="255">Such twisted weft or woven strand .” “ Oh , kind ,”</l>
     <l n="256">She said , “ is Eblis , unto whom I fain</l>
     <l n="257">Would give due thanks . His gorgeous train</l>
     <l n="258">But yesterday I saw the peacock spread ;</l>
     <l n="259">Bright in the sun gleamed his small crested head ;</l>
     <l n="260">His haughty neck wrinkled to green and blue ,</l>
     <l n="261">And since I needs must truly speak , I knew</l>
     <l n="262">Not color rich as his : and I have seen</l>
     <l n="263">The curious nest among the branches green ,</l>
     <l n="264">The busy weaver-bird plaits of thick leaves ,</l>
     <l n="265">And in and out its pliant meshes weaves ;</l>
     <l n="266">And since thou sayest ’ twere hard to match thy fine ,</l>
     <l n="267">Strong , woven fabrics , watch the weaver twine</l>
     <l n="268">His cunning wefts . Though still ,” she said , “ think not</l>
     <l n="269">I scorn thy gifts , Prince Eblis ; for I wot</l>
     <l n="270">Their worth is greater than my tongue can say .”</l>
     <l n="271">Then Eblis deeper in the cave led her a little way ,</l>
     <l n="272">And showed a stately screen of such fine art</l>
     <l n="273">One almost felt the breeze that seemed to part</l>
     <l n="274">The pictured boughs . And o ’ er the stirless lake</l>
     <l n="275">Dreamed the swift , wimpling waters sudden brake</l>
     <l n="276">Among the willows on its brink — and flowers</l>
     <l n="277">Of scarlet , shining-clean from summer showers ;</l>
     <l n="278">And Eblis said , “ Cold praise a friend should spare</l>
     <l n="279">This picture true . Certain naught else will dare</l>
     <l n="280">Vie with such beauty .”</l>
     <l n="281">Archly Lilith took</l>
     <l n="282">The rose from her bright hair , and lightly shook</l>
     <l n="283">The dewdrop from its heart . “ I loving , touch ,”</l>
     <l n="284">She said , “ these petals smooth . O , Eblis , such</l>
     <l n="285">Give to thy painted blooms ; give its cool sheen</l>
     <l n="286">Of morningtide , the mossy , lush leaves green</l>
     <l n="287">That fold it round . Give its faint , fragrant breath ,</l>
     <l n="288">When with the fickle breeze it dallieth .</l>
     <l n="289">Nay , fairer still my rose than gilded screen ,</l>
     <l n="290">Though it be limned with perfect art , I ween .”</l>
     <l n="291">Thereat smiled Eblis bitterly . “ I bring</l>
     <l n="292">One parting gift ,” he said , “ a dainty thing ;</l>
     <l n="293">Perchance in other time it will recall</l>
     <l n="294">One who strove long and patiently through all</l>
     <l n="295">These days to win thy praise .” An oval plane</l>
     <l n="296">Of crystal gave he her ; of fleck or stain</l>
     <l n="297">Clear-gleaming . Of ivory carven fine</l>
     <l n="298">The frame . And when she looked , “ Divine ,”</l>
     <l n="299">He laughed , “ the beauty it enshrines . Canst claim</l>
     <l n="300">Aught else is fairer ?” And Lilith again</l>
     <l n="301">Gazed in the glass , her face beholding there ,</l>
     <l n="302">Her pink flushed cheeks , her yellow streaming hair .</l>
     <l n="303">Quick came her breath . “ O prince ,” she slowly said ,</l>
     <l n="304">“ Fair is the stranger . Bid those lips so red</l>
     <l n="305">Speak once to Lilith . For methinks the voice</l>
     <l n="306">Of such in music flowed . Let me rejoice</l>
     <l n="307">Therein .” “ O glorious counterfeit !” cried</l>
     <l n="308">He . “ Lovelier is not on this earth wide !</l>
     <l n="309">Behold , sweet Lilith , ’ tis thine own pure face</l>
     <l n="310">That lends my happy mirror perfect grace</l>
     <l n="311">It else had not . Bid thou thine image speak !</l>
     <l n="312">No other happiness I elsewhere seek ,</l>
     <l n="313">If the soft tale she whispers be of me .”</l>
     <l n="314">And Lilith answered gravely , “ I know thee ,</l>
     <l n="315">Eblis . Master indeed of all crafts thou —</l>
     <l n="316">Red Sard , and marble sphere , and agile prow</l>
     <l n="317">Of pinnace light well wroughten were by thee</l>
     <l n="318">And decked full fair . And , beauteous to see ,</l>
     <l n="319">Fine woven weft and web , and the tall screen</l>
     <l n="320">O ’ errun with painted bloom , crystal , with gleam</l>
     <l n="321">Of Lilith ’ s face — thou madest these . Mayhap</l>
     <l n="322">Beetle and asp likewise didst tint — didst wrap</l>
     <l n="323">The green about my rose , and richly fringe</l>
     <l n="324">My cocoa-tree , or peacock ’ s train didst tinge</l>
     <l n="325">With dazzling hues . Methought thou wert a prince ,</l>
     <l n="326">But now Lilith should humbly kneel , since</l>
     <l n="327">Thou art far higher than she deemed , if thou</l>
     <l n="328">Madest these wondrous things .” And lowly now</l>
     <l n="329">As she would kneel , she drew anigh . But he</l>
     <l n="330">Cried , shrinking , “ Nay , I made them not .” And she</l>
     <l n="331">Low questioned , “ Eblis , tell me who then , did make</l>
     <l n="332">Them all . Who set the creeping hooded snake</l>
     <l n="333">And stealthy pard within the thorny brake ,</l>
     <l n="334">And spread the sea , and wreathed the waterfall</l>
     <l n="335">With foam ? Who reared the hoar hills , towering tall</l>
     <l n="336">Above the lands ?” With eyes wild flashing , low</l>
     <l n="337">He groaned : “ O Lilith , ask me not . My foe</l>
     <l n="338">He was — he is . Trembles with wrath my frame</l>
     <l n="339">If I but faintly breathe his awful name .”</l>
     <l n="340">Lilith replied , “ Meseemeth , master true</l>
     <l n="341">Of every craft is He .”</l>
     <l n="342">Forth the two</l>
     <l n="343">From that drear cavern passed . Ere the water ’ s brim</l>
     <l n="344">They gained , he plucked the wilding reeds , that slim</l>
     <l n="345">Stood by a brook . “ My pipe I make , one strain</l>
     <l n="346">Harmonious to wake . Nor yet again</l>
     <l n="347">Shalt thou such fresh notes hear . Music like mine</l>
     <l n="348">Methinks thou hast not known in any time .”</l>
     <l n="349">He laid his pipe unto his lips , and blew</l>
     <l n="350">A blast , wild , piercing , sweet . The far hills through</l>
     <l n="351">It rung . And softer fell , yet wild and clear .</l>
     <l n="352">It ceased . With drooping eyes , “ Once I did hear</l>
     <l n="353">A song as wildly clear , as sad ,” she said ,</l>
     <l n="354">“ In mine own realm .” And as she spoke , dark dread</l>
     <l n="355">The sky grew with a coming storm . “ Oh , haste ,”</l>
     <l n="356">He cried ; “ seek refuge ere this dreary waste</l>
     <l n="357">Reeks with the rain !” And fast they sped</l>
     <l n="358">Back to his ocean-cave . There safe , o ’ erhead</l>
     <l n="359">They watched the piling clouds . With angry roar</l>
     <l n="360">The baffled billows broke upon the rocks . O ’ er</l>
     <l n="361">Them rushed the shrieking storm . Wild through the grot</l>
     <l n="362">Wandered the prisoned wind , a troubled ghost that sought</l>
     <l n="363">Repose . Or low did moan , and trembling , wail ,</l>
     <l n="364">Like some sore-hearted thing that hideth , pale ,</l>
     <l n="365">And dare not front the day ; and wilder still ,</l>
     <l n="366">In chords melodious , swelled or sank , until</l>
     <l n="367">She sighed , “ Oh , this weird harp among the caves ,</l>
     <l n="368">Strange players hath ! For loud as one that raves ,</l>
     <l n="369">It rises . Now more sweetly fade away</l>
     <l n="370">Its mellow notes than thy thin pipes .” “ One day ,”</l>
     <l n="371">He said , “ mayhap my strain may please , when wind</l>
     <l n="372">Doth not outpipe my slighted reeds . Unkind</l>
     <l n="373">Thou art .” “ The storm is past ; to mine own land</l>
     <l n="374">I would return ,” she said . And Eblis o ’ er the strand</l>
     <l n="375">Led her . And homeward silent turned his prow</l>
     <l n="376">That swiftly through the swirling waves did plow .</l>
     <l n="377">But when they parted , Eblis mused , “ I know</l>
     <l n="378">No gift soever winneth her , rich though</l>
     <l n="379">It be and seemly . Into this pure soul ,</l>
     <l n="380">Through fear of ill , I enter ; or by goal</l>
     <l n="381">Of future gain before it set .”</l>
     <l n="382">So came</l>
     <l n="383">He to her pleasance yet again . A flame</l>
     <l n="384">Leaped high above a brazier that he bore ,</l>
     <l n="385">Its sweet , white , scented wood quick lapping o ’ er .</l>
     <l n="386">With darkened face Eblis above her hung .</l>
     <l n="387">“ This hath , than my poor pipe , a keener tongue ,”</l>
     <l n="388">Smileless and stern , he said . “ Oh , dame ,</l>
     <l n="389">List how the wild , crisp , crackling ruby flame</l>
     <l n="390">Eats through the tender boughs . A trusty knave</l>
     <l n="391">It is , that serves me well , and loud doth rave</l>
     <l n="392">As tiger caged . When I do set it free ,</l>
     <l n="393">With angry fangs leaps on its prey . But see ,</l>
     <l n="394">It now sleeps harmlessly , till Eblis calls</l>
     <l n="395">His faithful servant back . Lilith , when falls</l>
     <l n="396">The red fire at thy feet , dost fear ?” “ Nay , nay ,”</l>
     <l n="397">She cried , and drew her white neck up . “ A way</l>
     <l n="398">To tame it thou hast found . Believe me , since</l>
     <l n="399">It is thy slave I too will bind it , prince .</l>
     <l n="400">Should Lilith fear ? Unfaltering , these eyes</l>
     <l n="401">Have watched when rushing storm-clouds heaped the skies ,</l>
     <l n="402">And the black whirlwind , with loud , deafening roar ,</l>
     <l n="403">Beat the torn waves ; or whirled against the shore</l>
     <l n="404">The tumbling billows , with fierce lips that bit</l>
     <l n="405">The shrinking land . And the wreathed lightnings split</l>
     <l n="406">The cloud with thunder dread : or wildly burst</l>
     <l n="407">Upon the sea the water-spout . Shall first</l>
     <l n="408">She fear thy flame , who feared not these ?” “ Fit mate</l>
     <l n="409">Art thou for Eblis ,” answered he . “ His fate</l>
     <l n="410">Share , great-souled one . Thou wouldst not meanly shrink ,</l>
     <l n="411">Though his strong heart did fail . O Lilith , think !</l>
     <l n="412">The crown of clustered worlds thou mayest find ,</l>
     <l n="413">If thou with him who loveth thee wilt bind</l>
     <l n="414">Thy life .” “ Nay , far happier seems to me</l>
     <l n="415">Than eagle caged , the wild lark soaring free ,”</l>
     <l n="416">She said . And through her rose-pleached alleys strayed</l>
     <l n="417">They to the sea . And tender music made</l>
     <l n="418">That guileful voice ; yet slow his wooing sped</l>
     <l n="419">Those summer days . But when were dead</l>
     <l n="420">And brown the crisping leaves , “ Oh , love ,” he said ,</l>
     <l n="421">“ Of all the centuries , thou rarest bloom ,</l>
     <l n="422">Thy shut heart open wide . Its sweet perfume ,</l>
     <l n="423">Though I should die , fain would I parting drink .</l>
     <l n="424">Sleeps yet thy love ? From me no longer shrink ,</l>
     <l n="425">My Lilith . Oh , lift up thy tender eyes ;</l>
     <l n="426">In their blue depths doth happy morning rise ;</l>
     <l n="427">’ Tis night if they be closed .”</l>
     <l n="428">She softly sighed ;</l>
     <l n="429">And ancient strife recalling , thus replied :</l>
     <l n="430">“ When dwelt a prince discrowned , well satisfied ?</l>
     <l n="431">And fallen , loving , still art thou a prince ,</l>
     <l n="432">And otherwhiles might sorrow bring me , since</l>
     <l n="433">It might hap thou wouldst much desire her realm ,</l>
     <l n="434">Were Lilith thine ; for princes seize the helm</l>
     <l n="435">When Love lies moored , and bid the shallop seek</l>
     <l n="436">Across the waves new lands . But Love is weak ,</l>
     <l n="437">And so , alas , the craft upon the sands</l>
     <l n="438">Is dashed , while one , on-looking , wrings her hands .</l>
     <l n="439">Such days I have outlived . Like Adam , thou</l>
     <l n="440">Perchance will seek to bind the loosed . Then how</l>
     <l n="441">( If one hath drunken wine of liberty )</l>
     <l n="442">Shall she , athirst , rejoice ; no longer free ,</l>
     <l n="443">Be glad ?”</l>
     <l n="444">“ My love ,” he said , “ large-hearted lives ,</l>
     <l n="445">Full dowers thee , and royal bounty gives ,</l>
     <l n="446">Nor knoweth law , save Lilith ’ s wish alone .”</l>
     <l n="447">“ Why , then ,” she answered , “ on the polished stone</l>
     <l n="448">That fronts yon hill , write , Eblis , in full day ,</l>
     <l n="449">That other time we read it clear , and say ,</l>
     <l n="450">‘ Hereon are graven all those early vows</l>
     <l n="451">We whispered low aneath the summer boughs ,’</l>
     <l n="452">Write every word . That so the stone shall be</l>
     <l n="453">Ever a witness mute twixt thee and me .</l>
     <l n="454">Then shall I know thou seekest in me no thrall</l>
     <l n="455">For after-days , if thou make compact . All</l>
     <l n="456">Thou hast said , write now .”</l>
     <l n="457">Then on the stone ,</l>
     <l n="458">As she had said , graved Eblis , and thereon</l>
     <l n="459">Did set his seal . So wedded they : and hand</l>
     <l n="460">In hand the wide world roamed . Or in her land</l>
     <l n="461">Abode . And oft , of hours , ere yet on earth</l>
     <l n="462">He walked , she questioned . Or he loosed with mirth</l>
     <l n="463">Her yellow hair , down-streaming o ’ er his arm ;</l>
     <l n="464">And ’ gainst his cheek her breath came sweet and warm ;</l>
     <l n="465">As through his dusky locks caressing played</l>
     <l n="466">Her fingers slim ; and shadows , half afraid ,</l>
     <l n="467">She saw in his wild eyes .</l>
     <l n="468">Or paths remote</l>
     <l n="469">They trod , watching the white clouds rise and float</l>
     <l n="470">Athwart the sky . Or by the listless main ,</l>
     <l n="471">Or ’ neath the lotus bough , slow paced the twain .</l>
     <l n="472">Or dragon-trees spread their cool leafy screen .</l>
     <l n="473">And faint crept odors through the mangroves green ,</l>
     <l n="474">Where paused the pair upon the sandy shore .</l>
     <l n="475">Love-tranced , unheeded , swiftly passed them o ’ er</l>
     <l n="476">Glad summer days : till one hour softly laid</l>
     <l n="477">At Lilith ’ s feet a fair , lone babe , that strayed</l>
     <l n="478">From distant Dreamland far . So might one deem</l>
     <l n="479">That looked upon its face . Or , it might seem</l>
     <l n="480">From other climes , a rose-leaf blown apart ,</l>
     <l n="481">Down-fluttered there , to gladden Lilith ’ s heart .</l>

     <l n="1">To that fair Elf-child other summers came ;</l>
     <l n="2">But Lilith walked , heart-hungered , filled with shame ,</l>
     <l n="3">Naught comforted . And in that shadow-land</l>
     <l n="4">She sorrowing bore , in after-time , a band</l>
     <l n="5">Of elfin babes , that waked dim echoes long</l>
     <l n="6">Forgotten there , and ghastly bursts of song .</l>
     <l n="7">Then Lilith saddened more , for that she knew</l>
     <l n="8">The curse was fallen now . And cried she through</l>
     <l n="9">Fast-falling tears , “ Oh , me most desolate ,</l>
     <l n="10">That shall not know in any time the fate</l>
     <l n="11">Of happier mothers ! Nay , nor cool touch</l>
     <l n="12">Of baby hands . Oh , longed-for , loved so much !</l>
     <l n="13">Alas , my babes , ere yet hour-old ye fly ,</l>
     <l n="14">Out-spreading shining wings with jeering cry ,</l>
     <l n="15">Afar from me . Most hapless I , from whom</l>
     <l n="16">The crown of motherhood , yet white with bloom ,</l>
     <l n="17">Falls blighted ! Close in these empty arms fain</l>
     <l n="18">Would I clasp my babes ! My tender pain</l>
     <l n="19">But once could ye not solace ? Nay , ’ tis vain ;</l>
     <l n="20">I shall not kiss their lips , nor hear again ,</l>
     <l n="21">As gladder mothers may , low-rippling , sweet ,</l>
     <l n="22">The laughter children bring about their feet .</l>
     <l n="23">Oh , soulless ones , can ye not wait awhile ,</l>
     <l n="24">’ Till on your loveless lips I wake one smile ?”</l>
     <l n="25">But merrily out-laughed the phantom crew ;</l>
     <l n="26">On shining pinions white , swift seaward flew ,</l>
     <l n="27">Or upward rose , slow-fading in the blue ;</l>
     <l n="28">Or lured her trembling , green morasses through .</l>
     <l n="29">And ’ mong the frothy waves they vanished fast ;</l>
     <l n="30">Or shrieked with glee borne on the wintry blast ,</l>
     <l n="31">And wilder raised their warlock song .</l>
     <l n="32">While fairer grew each day that elfin throng .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="33">To pluck the mangoes brown , fair Lilith sped</l>
     <l n="34">One morn . Quick throbbed her heart . On mossy bed</l>
     <l n="35">Lay all her babes . With face like morning , shone</l>
     <l n="36">One there , and wide her yellow hair out-blown</l>
     <l n="37">As ’ twere in play . Red-flushed her cheeks , and deep</l>
     <l n="38">About her lips the baby smiles . Asleep</l>
     <l n="39">Was one , white-gleaming , pure as pearl unseen</l>
     <l n="40">In sunless caves , close-shut . And one did lean</l>
     <l n="41">Against his fellow , lithe , sun-flushed and brown ,</l>
     <l n="42">With rings of jetty hair that low adown</l>
     <l n="43">His bosom streamed . And one there was , whose dream</l>
     <l n="44">O ’ erflowed with laughter . And one did seem</l>
     <l n="45">Half-waking . One , with dimpled arms in sleep</l>
     <l n="46">Thrust elbow-deep in moss , that sure did weep</l>
     <l n="47">Ere yet he slept , and on his cheek scarce dried</l>
     <l n="48">The wilful tears .</l>
     <l n="49">Then low , pale Lilith cried</l>
     <l n="50">As near she drew , down-bending tender eyes :</l>
     <l n="51">“ And are ye here , my babes ; and will ye rise</l>
     <l n="52">If I but break your sleep ?” His naked feet</l>
     <l n="53">One faintly moved as low she leant ; and warm</l>
     <l n="54">His slumbrous breath stirred ’ gainst her circling arm ,</l>
     <l n="55">And slow aneath his closed lids slipped a waft</l>
     <l n="56">Of wind , that loosed a trickling tear . Its craft</l>
     <l n="57">The mother-heart forgot thereat . “ At last ,</l>
     <l n="58">Close to my breast , my babes ,” she cried , and fast</l>
     <l n="59">Laughing , outstretched her eager hands and strong .</l>
     <l n="60">Then lay with empty arms .</l>
     <l n="61">The elfin throng</l>
     <l n="62">Breasted the pulsing air with mocking song .</l>
     <l n="63">“ Alas ,” she said , “ could ye not give one kiss —</l>

     <l n="357">For this have lost the very bloom of life ?</l>
     <l n="358">So Adam comfort finds , not knowing strife !</l>
     <l n="359">Look you , that fragile thing at Adam ’ s side —</l>
     <l n="360">I heed her not . But Lilith is denied</l>
     <l n="361">The treasure she so careless doth possess .</l>
     <l n="362">See how the babe , scarce waking , doth caress</l>
     <l n="363">The mother ! Look ! Oh , hear the mother croon</l>
     <l n="364">Above her child ! Ah , Eblis , love , I swoon —</l>
     <l n="365">I shall not know such joy . Alas , to me</l>
     <l n="366">No babe shall come ! Accurséd may she be ,</l>
     <l n="367">Cursed Adam too . Thrice heavy on the head</l>
     <l n="368">Of this poor babe my wrong be visited .”</l>
     <l n="369">So , trembling , she brake off .</l>
     <l n="370">“ Fast fades the light ,</l>
     <l n="371">Sweet love . Once more to our dark realm of night</l>
     <l n="372">Let us return ,” he said .</l>
     <l n="373">As on fared they</l>
     <l n="374">With merry jest , Eblis gan cheer the way .</l>
     <l n="375">“ Nay , otherwhiles mirth pleased ,” she said . “ Knowest thou</l>
     <l n="376">What name she bears , who dwells in Eden now ?</l>
     <l n="377">When Lilith went , long tarried Adam lone ?”</l>
     <l n="378">She said . Replied he , “ All to me is known</l>
     <l n="379">Since that same hour you parted . What befell ,</l>
     <l n="380">To thee as we wend onward I will tell .</l>

     <l n="381">“ Calm morn in Eden streaked the skies with red ,</l>
     <l n="382">And flushed the waiting hills above the grassy bed</l>
     <l n="383">Where Adam , joyless , saw new rise the sun ,</l>
     <l n="384">Unwinding golden webs night-vapors spun</l>
     <l n="385">Athwart low meads . Slow , droning murmurs sent</l>
     <l n="386">The waking bees , with bloom and fragrance blent .</l>
     <l n="387">Unheeded poured her music blithesome Day</l>
     <l n="388">The reedy brooks beside and shallows gray .</l>
     <l n="389">For lone to Adam seemed the place , and cold ;</l>
     <l n="390">The landscape dumb , as one aneath the mould .</l>
     <l n="391">For Lilith ’ s sake , no more was Eden fair .</l>
     <l n="392">Bloomless the days , the nights bowed down with care .</l>
     <l n="393">Oft pacing pathways dim , he saw the gleam</l>
     <l n="394">Of strange-faced flowers beside the purling stream ,</l>
     <l n="395">Or toyed with circling leaves ; or plucked the grass ,</l>
     <l n="396">And watched through rifted trees the clouds o ’ erpass ;</l>
     <l n="397">Wide roaming , heard the waters idly break</l>
     <l n="398">Far ’ gainst the curving beach .</l>
     <l n="399">“ And grieving , spake ,</l>
     <l n="400">‘ Oh , sweet with thee each hour — each wilding way ,</l>
     <l n="401">And sweet the memory of each gathered spray .</l>
     <l n="402">Could you not wait , dear love ? Or come once more ?</l>
     <l n="403">Yea , ’ till you come , vain doth great Nature pour</l>
     <l n="404">Her richest gifts .’ He paused , and heard alone</l>
     <l n="405">Respondent fall , the wood-dove ’ s plaintive moan ,</l>
     <l n="406">And the spent winds among the scented glades .</l>
     <l n="407">Moss-couched beneath the glinting forest shades ,</l>
     <l n="408">He gazed , when shadows o ’ er the hills crept light ,</l>
     <l n="409">Quick vanishing , like phantom fingers white ,</l>
     <l n="410">Until on mead , and mere , and sounding shore</l>
     <l n="411">Eden found voice , sad plaining , ‘ Never-more !’</l>
     <l n="412">Long time he pondered on blue peaks remote</l>
     <l n="413">When slow , as stranded ships that listless float ,</l>
     <l n="414">Moved by the sunset clouds . Or the white rack</l>
     <l n="415">Swept o ’ er the garden walls .</l>
     <l n="416">“‘ Would I their track</l>
     <l n="417">Might take ,’ he said , ‘ Lilith , so long you stay .</l>
     <l n="418">Whom my soul follows sorrowing — alway .’</l>
     <l n="419">Thus ever mourned he , comfortless ; that so</l>
     <l n="420">In after days the Master , in the glow</l>
     <l n="421">Of morning-tide , the mother of the race</l>
     <l n="422">Gave for his solacement .</l>
     <l n="423">“ Oh , fair the face</l>
     <l n="424">Young Eve bent o ’ er his sleep . Ere down the glade</l>
     <l n="425">The startled fawn leaps swift , her glance dismayed</l>
     <l n="426">Questions the hunter , mute . Such eyes — so brown ,</l>
     <l n="427">So soft , so winning , shy — that looked adown</l>
     <l n="428">When Adam waked . Like vagrant tendrils , tossed</l>
     <l n="429">Dark hair about her brows . And quaintly crossed</l>
     <l n="430">Her hands upon her breast . Less red the dart</l>
     <l n="431">That deepest cleaves the folded rose ’ s heart ,</l>
     <l n="432">Than her round cheeks . Not hers the regal air</l>
     <l n="433">Of Lilith lost , the white arms , lissom , bare ,</l>
     <l n="434">The slender throat ; the elbows dimpled deep , whereto</l>
     <l n="435">Might scarcely reach Eve ’ s head .</l>
     <l n="436">“ Yet soft , as through</l>
     <l n="437">Some pleasant dream , the summer ’ s spicy air</l>
     <l n="438">Stirs odorous ’ mong seaward gardens fair ,</l>
     <l n="439">In southland hid ; so , gently , Eve straightway</l>
     <l n="440">To Adam ’ s life unbidden came , to stay</l>
     <l n="441">Forever there . Sure entrance then made she</l>
     <l n="442">Into that heart untenanted by thee .</l>
     <l n="443">“ So , to some olden house , from whose shut doors</l>
     <l n="444">One went erewhile , another comes . Its floors</l>
     <l n="445">All empty sees . The lowly threshold worn ,</l>
     <l n="446">The moss-grown roof , the casements left forlorn .</l>
     <l n="447">Amid the shadows round about him stands ,</l>
     <l n="448">Missing the footsteps passed to other lands ,</l>
     <l n="449">And whispers tenderly , ‘ Since here no more</l>
     <l n="450">The owner bides , what harm if on the floor</l>
     <l n="451">I pass ? Good chance it were the clambering vine</l>
     <l n="452">About the porch with fingers deft to twine —</l>
     <l n="453">To draw the curtains , ope the door . For who</l>
     <l n="454">May know how soon these paths untended , through ,</l>
     <l n="455">He comes again , with weary , way-worn feet ,</l>
     <l n="456">Who made aforetime , other days so sweet .</l>
     <l n="457">Wherefore , I enter now . For whose dear sake</l>
     <l n="458">These vacant rooms , white , fragrant , clean , I make .</l>
     <l n="459">And when , world-wearied , he returns , we twain</l>
     <l n="460">Perchance together bide . Nor part again .’</l>
     <l n="461">So Eve found refuge . Tender love , the spell</l>
     <l n="462">Whereby she ruled . Peaceful the pair did dwell .</l>
     <l n="463">Fast fled the happy years , till softly laid</l>
     <l n="464">In her glad arms the babe — a winsome maid .”</l>
     <l n="465">He ended there . Between them silence deep</l>
     <l n="466">Fell , as they journeyed . And the furthest steep</l>
     <l n="467">They crossed , that o ’ er their shadow-world rose high .</l>
     <l n="468">Then saw they level plains , their home , anigh .</l>
     <l n="469">And now , seeking her pleasance once again ,</l>
     <l n="470">They came to their own land . But all in vain</l>
     <l n="471">His care . Silent she was , and oft did grieve ,</l>
     <l n="472">Till Eblis wrathful cried : “ Because this Eve</l>
     <l n="473">Adam holds dear , art mourning ? Still dost yearn</l>
     <l n="474">To mate his sordid soul ? Or wouldst thou turn</l>
     <l n="475">From summer land to Eden walls ?</l>
     <l n="476">“ The man</l>
     <l n="477">Belike , ne ’ er loved thee . So is it young Eve can</l>
     <l n="478">His pulses sway . Is she not passing fair ?</l>
     <l n="479">Her fancies wild , it is her daily care</l>
     <l n="480">To bend beneath his ever fickle will .</l>
     <l n="481">Red-lipped and soft , she deftly rules him still ,</l>
     <l n="482">Though he wist not . Yet sweeter Lilith ’ s frown</l>
     <l n="483">Than archest smile she wears . Great Soul ! The crown</l>
     <l n="484">Thou bearest of fadeless life . For fleeting dreams</l>
     <l n="485">In Paradise , beside the winding streams ,</l>
     <l n="486">Wilt thou resign such boon ? Thou art , in sooth ,</l>
     <l n="487">Of mold too firm for Adam ’ s love . In truth</l>
     <l n="488">A prince — though fallen — consorts best with thee</l>
     <l n="489">Say which were wise , with Eden ’ s lord to be ,</l>
     <l n="490">Or , shining high , the purer soul , the star</l>
     <l n="491">That fadeless burns , and Eblis lights afar ?</l>
     <l n="492">Were it not grand through endless spaces hurled</l>
     <l n="493">With me to drive , above a shrinking world</l>
     <l n="494">Our chariot , wide ?</l>
     <l n="495">“ For I foresee when dawn</l>
     <l n="496">Dark days upon our foes , and hope is gone .</l>
     <l n="497">Wherefore , my Lilith , now , as seems thee good ,</l>
     <l n="498">Make choice .” Thereat she , turning where she stood ,</l>
     <l n="499">With kisses hung about his neck , and smiled ,</l>
     <l n="500">Crying , “ Thine , Eblis , thine !” So were they reconciled .</l>

     <l n="1">And Lilith oft to Paradise returned ,</l>
     <l n="2">For fierce within her , bitter hatred burned ,</l>
     <l n="3">And better , dearer , seemed revenge than aught</l>
     <l n="4">She else desired . The coppice oft she sought ,</l>
     <l n="5">Much hoping direful evil might be wrought</l>
     <l n="6">Upon the love that bloomed in Eden .</l>
     <l n="7">Wide</l>
     <l n="8">Oft strayed fair Eve ; the little maid , beside ,</l>
     <l n="9">Plucking the lotus ; or by sedgy moats ,</l>
     <l n="10">From ribbed papyrus broad , frail fairy boats</l>
     <l n="11">Deft fashioning . Or Adam , watching , smiled ,</l>
     <l n="12">With flowery wreaths engarlanding the child .</l>
     <l n="13">And laughed the pair , intent on pleasant toil ,</l>
     <l n="14">When blithe the child upheaped her fruity spoil —</l>
     <l n="15">Great globes of red and gold . Or roguish face</l>
     <l n="16">O ’ er feathery broods , or in the further space</l>
     <l n="17">To count the small blue eggs , she sportive bent ;</l>
     <l n="18">And far her restless feet swift glancing went .</l>
     <l n="19">It chanced one day she watched the careless flight</l>
     <l n="20">Of vagrant butterflies , that circled light</l>
     <l n="21">Uncertain , high , above a copse rose-wreathed ;</l>
     <l n="22">Then soft down-dropping , gaudy wings they sheathed</l>
     <l n="23">Beside a darkling pool . The copse anear</l>
     <l n="24">With yellow buds was strewn . And softly here</l>
     <l n="25">She crept , deeming her little half-shut hand</l>
     <l n="26">Might snare the fairest of that gleaming band .</l>
     <l n="27">Yet ere she touched it , wide its wings outspread</l>
     <l n="28">In flight .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="29">And still she , swift pursuing , sped</l>
     <l n="30">Among the groves , till wearied , slept the maid</l>
     <l n="31">Deep in the mid-day shadows , lowly laid .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="32">Without , stooped Lilith . And with fingers swift ,</l>
     <l n="33">Among the leaves she oped a small green rift ,</l>
     <l n="34">That she might see the child . The hedge was wet</l>
     <l n="35">With starry blooms . Whereto her hand she set</l>
     <l n="36">When she awaked , seeing each dainty frond</l>
     <l n="37">Of fragrant ferns , dusk mirrored in the pond .</l>
     <l n="38">The child came near the copse , much wondering :</l>
     <l n="39">From glossy stems the smooth leaves sundering .</l>
     <l n="40">And stooping o ’ er the rift , she saw there , low</l>
     <l n="41">Against the hedge , a face like drifted snow ,</l>
     <l n="42">And soft eyes , blue as violets show</l>
     <l n="43">Above the brooks ; and hair that downward rolled</l>
     <l n="44">Upon the ground in glittering strands of gold .</l>
     <l n="45">Mute stood the maid , naught fearing , but amazed .</l>
     <l n="46">Then nearer drew , and lingering , she gazed</l>
     <l n="47">In those blue orbs . And smiling as she knelt ,</l>
     <l n="48">The stranger quickly loosed her shining belt</l>
     <l n="49">Of gems . Flawless each stone whose pallid gleam</l>
     <l n="50">Lit silent nooks , or slept by far-off stream</l>
     <l n="51">Unheeded — pale pearls with shimmering light ,</l>
     <l n="52">From distant oceans plucked , blue sapphires bright ,</l>
     <l n="53">And diamonds rosy-cold , and burning red</l>
     <l n="54">The rubies fine , and yellow topaz shed</l>
     <l n="55">Its sultry glow , jasper , dull onyx white ,</l>
     <l n="56">Sardonyx , rare chalcèdon , streaked with light .</l>
     <l n="57">Against her white breast that bright zone she laid ,</l>
     <l n="58">Then stretched it , flashing forth , toward the maid ,</l>
     <l n="59">And clasped it round her throat .</l>
     <l n="60">A luring strain</l>
     <l n="61">She sung , sweet as the pause of summer rain .</l>
     <l n="62">So soft , so pure her voice , the child it drew</l>
     <l n="63">Still nearer that green rift ; and low there-through</l>
     <l n="64">She laughing stroked the down-bent golden head</l>
     <l n="65">With her soft baby hands . And parting , spread</l>
     <l n="66">The silken hair about her little face ,</l>
     <l n="67">And kissed the temptress through the green-leaved space .</l>
     <l n="68">Whereat fell Lilith snatched the babe and fled ,</l>
     <l n="69">Crying , as swift from Eden ’ s bounds she sped ,</l>
     <l n="70">And like a fallen star shone on her breast</l>
     <l n="71">The child , “ At last ! at last ! thy peaceful rest</l>
     <l n="72">Ere long will cease . O helpless mourn , frail Eve ,</l>
     <l n="73">Uncomforted . O hapless mother , grieve ,</l>
     <l n="74">Since Lilith far from thee thy babe doth bear !</l>
     <l n="75">She leaves thy loving arms , thy tender care .</l>
     <l n="76">Nor canst thou follow anywhere my flight ,</l>
     <l n="77">When far we go athwart the falling night .</l>
     <l n="78">Ah , little babe , close-meshed in yellow hair</l>
     <l n="79">Thou liest pale ! Fear not , thou art so fair ,</l>
     <l n="80">Much comfort lives in thee .”</l>
     <l n="81">So ended she ,</l>
     <l n="82">And onward , hostile lands among , passed fleet</l>
     <l n="83">Blue solitudes afar , till paused her feet ,</l>
     <l n="84">Where highest ’ mong hoar climbing peaks , uprose</l>
     <l n="85">A mountain crest .</l>
     <l n="86">It was the third day ’ s close .</l>
     <l n="87">In those untrodden ways there was no sound ,</l>
     <l n="88">No sight of living thing , the barren heights around .</l>
     <l n="89">No hum of insect life , no whirring wing of bird .</l>
     <l n="90">Bare rocks alone , all fissured , blotched and blurred</l>
     <l n="91">As with red stain of battle-fields unseen .</l>
     <l n="92">Far , far below , still vales were shining green .</l>
     <l n="93">And leaping downward swift , a mountain stream</l>
     <l n="94">Crept soft to sleep , where meadow grasses dream .</l>
     <l n="95">Wan , wayworn , there , the babe upon her knee ,</l>
     <l n="96">Lilith sat down . “ O Eve ,” she said , “ on me</l>
     <l n="97">The child smiles sweet ! Fondle her silken hair</l>
     <l n="98">If now thou canst , or clasp her small hands fair .</l>
     <l n="99">Thou hast my Paradise . Lo , thine I bear</l>
     <l n="100">Afar from thee . See , then ! Its transient woe</l>
     <l n="101">Thy babe e ’ en now forgets ; and sweet and low</l>
     <l n="102">It babbles on my knee . In sooth , not long</l>
     <l n="103">Endure her griefs , and through my crooning song</l>
     <l n="104">She kisses me , recalling not the place</l>
     <l n="105">Whence she has come . Nay , nor her mother ’ s face .”</l>
     <l n="106">Long time stayed Lilith in that land . More calm</l>
     <l n="107">Each day she grew , for soft , like healing balm ,</l>
     <l n="108">The child ’ s pure love fell on her sin-sick soul .</l>
     <l n="109">Now oft among the crags , fleet-footed , stole</l>
     <l n="110">The maid , or lightly crossed the fertile plain .</l>
     <l n="111">And blithesome sang among the growing grain</l>
     <l n="112">That brake in billowy waves about her feet .</l>
     <l n="113">But when the wheat full ripened was , and sweet ,</l>
     <l n="114">She plucked and ate . Thereat a shadowy pain ,</l>
     <l n="115">A sense of sorrow , stirred that childish brain ,</l>
     <l n="116">She wist not why . For it did surely seem</l>
     <l n="117">Before her waking thought , with pallid gleam</l>
     <l n="118">Of other days , dim pictures passed ; of wood</l>
     <l n="119">And stream , beyond these mountain rims . And stood ,</l>
     <l n="120">It seemed , midway a garden wide , a tree that bright</l>
     <l n="121">Like silver gleamed , and broad boughs light</l>
     <l n="122">Uplifted . Like ripened wheat the fruit thereon ,</l>
     <l n="123">When low the westering sun upon it shone .</l>
     <l n="124">Then slow the maid did turn , and silent stand</l>
     <l n="125">At Lilith ’ s side . And o ’ er that mountain land ,</l>
     <l n="126">Down-looking , mused . Or lifted pensive eyes ,</l>
     <l n="127">And gaze that questioned if in any wise</l>
     <l n="128">She might perceive the land she longing sought ;</l>
     <l n="129">But of its stream , or garden , saw she naught .</l>
     <l n="130">Thereat Lilith with white lips drew more near ,</l>
     <l n="131">And clasped in her lithe arms the child so dear .</l>
     <l n="132">And once again fled swift , a shadowy shape ,</l>
     <l n="133">Across green fields . And heard , through silence , break</l>
     <l n="134">A voice she could not hush , that loudly wailed ,</l>
     <l n="135">“ My babe ! Give me my babe !”</l>
     <l n="136">And Lilith paled ,</l>
     <l n="137">And listening , heard , borne ever on the wind ,</l>
     <l n="138">The tread of feet fast following behind .</l>
     <l n="139">Then westward turned , where once among new ways</l>
     <l n="140">With Eblis she had trod in other days ,</l>
     <l n="141">When far they wandered . Thitherward she bent</l>
     <l n="142">Her timid steps , the babe upon her breast ,</l>
     <l n="143">Until with travel worn her noontide rest</l>
     <l n="144">She took . And now a land of alien blooms</l>
     <l n="145">About them lay , outwafting strange perfumes .</l>
     <l n="146">And quaint defiles , that sloped behind a bay ;</l>
     <l n="147">And level fields ; and curly vines that lay</l>
     <l n="148">Thick clustered o ’ er with unripe fruit ; and bent</l>
     <l n="149">Above them fragrant limes and spicy scent</l>
     <l n="150">Of citron and of myrtle all the place</l>
     <l n="151">Made sweet , and ’ mid the trees , an open space</l>
     <l n="152">They saw .</l>
     <l n="153">Not far away a broad lagoon</l>
     <l n="154">Burned like a topaz ’ neath a crescent moon ,</l>
     <l n="155">For day was parting . Even-tide apace</l>
     <l n="156">Drew on , and chill the night dews filled the place .</l>
     <l n="157">Upon the waters dusky shadows clung ,</l>
     <l n="158">And ashen-gray the broad leaves drooping hung ;</l>
     <l n="159">Low ’ mong the marish buds lay one that made</l>
     <l n="160">Against the sudden dusk a duskier shade —</l>
     <l n="161">Despairing arms upflinging to the sky ,</l>
     <l n="162">Smiting the silence with unheeded cry —</l>
     <l n="163">“ O mother , childless ! Wife — of all bereft !</l>
     <l n="164">Alas , my babe , not even thou art left</l>
     <l n="165">To comfort me , in these last hopeless days ,</l>
     <l n="166">Shut out from Paradise . Through unknown ways</l>
     <l n="167">I sought thee sorrowing . Oh , once again ,</l>
     <l n="168">My Adam , come ! Is not this gnawing pain</l>
     <l n="169">Of punishment enow , that thou unkind</l>
     <l n="170">Art grown ? Ah , never more shall I thee find ?</l>
     <l n="171">Alas , I ever was but weak . Alone</l>
     <l n="172">I cannot live . Come but again , mine own .</l>
     <l n="173">No longer leave me mourning , desolate .</l>
     <l n="174">In tears I call thee . Oh , in tears I wait</l>
     <l n="175">Thy sweet , forgiving kiss !”</l>
     <l n="176">Ended she so</l>
     <l n="177">Her plaint . And ’ mong the glistening leaves hid low ,</l>
     <l n="178">Lilith yet fiercer clasped the child</l>
     <l n="179">When that lorn mother , tear-stained , weeping , wild ,</l>
     <l n="180">Poured forth her woe .</l>
     <l n="181">As one that wakes to life</l>
     <l n="182">From peaceful dreams , leaps quick amid the strife</l>
     <l n="183">Of morning hours , so now the maid to pass</l>
     <l n="184">From Lilith ’ s arms strove hard . And loosed her clasp ,</l>
     <l n="185">And turned her shadowed face with plaintive moan</l>
     <l n="186">And fond beseeching eyes , where lay her mother lone .</l>
     <l n="187">But Lilith hardening , seized the child again ,</l>
     <l n="188">And from her ears shut out the mother ’ s pain</l>
     <l n="189">With wilful hands .</l>
     <l n="190">So passed she quick away .</l>
     <l n="191">Across the dusky path , low fallen , lay</l>
     <l n="192">Pale Eve , till clear she saw the dawn ’ s pure ray ,</l>
     <l n="193">And as she looked , the voice of one she heard</l>
     <l n="194">Anigh . Her heart to sudden joy was stirred .</l>
     <l n="195">“ Rise up , mine own ,” he said , “ no more apart</l>
     <l n="196">We walk .” Then she arose , and cried , “ Dear heart ,</l>
     <l n="197">Close hold me . So ! Methinks I dreamed we were</l>
     <l n="198">Parted long time .”</l>
     <l n="199">So went , the exiled pair</l>
     <l n="200">From home thrust out , together — everywhere .</l>
     <l n="201">And oft they journeyed on with sufferings spent</l>
     <l n="202">To distant lands . And oft with labor bent</l>
     <l n="203">Recalled the olden home , with brimming eyes ,</l>
     <l n="204">Hemmed in by mountains blue — lost Paradise .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="205">Meanwhile , to her own realm Lilith long since</l>
     <l n="206">Was come , glad greeting Eblis . “ O my prince ,</l>
     <l n="207">I have most bravely done . Our foes full sore</l>
     <l n="208">Are smitten now . My guerdon o ’ er and o ’ er</l>
     <l n="209">Thou wilt bestow , I ween , in kisses warm</l>
     <l n="210">As my own southland ’ s breath . For I great harm</l>
     <l n="211">Have wrought that hated pair . With feeble moan</l>
     <l n="212">Lies Eve in a far land , thrust out . Alone ,</l>
     <l n="213">Deserted . And whence angered Adam flies</l>
     <l n="214">I know not . Nay , nor what new world his eyes</l>
     <l n="215">Behold . Nor even if he live .</l>
     <l n="216">“ But see !</l>
     <l n="217">Sleeps on my breast the babe — Eve ’ s babe . And she</l>
     <l n="218">Shall know no more its tender , sweet caress ,</l>
     <l n="219">Soft medicining woe . The wilderness</l>
     <l n="220">Uncheered by love , is hers .”</l>
     <l n="221">And by the sea ,</l>
     <l n="222">Peaceful abode , long time content , the three ,</l>
     <l n="223">Save that the child unmurmuring drooped .</l>
     <l n="224">Then oft above her Lilith , singing , stooped ,</l>
     <l n="225">Striving to wake the baby smiles again</l>
     <l n="226">About her wee , warm mouth . Vain wiles ! And vain</l>
     <l n="227">Her loving skill . All still she lay , and pale .</l>
     <l n="228">As one at sea pines for a lonely vale</l>
     <l n="229">Besprent with cuckoo flowers ; the faint wild breath</l>
     <l n="230">Of cradled buds , among the cloven elms , and saith ,</l>
     <l n="231">‘ I shall not see that place beyond the seas ,</l>
     <l n="232">Nor any more pluck red anemones</l>
     <l n="233">In windless nooks .’</l>
     <l n="234">So seemed the child , and frail</l>
     <l n="235">As one that weeps above dead joys . Then pale</l>
     <l n="236">Grew Lilith as those wasting lips she pressed</l>
     <l n="237">And kissed the filmy eyes , and kissing , blessed</l>
     <l n="238">The child .</l>
     <l n="239">But Eblis touched the hand so worn ,</l>
     <l n="240">The faded , wasted face . “ Happy , thou mother lorn ,</l>
     <l n="241">Unseeing her ,” he said . “ This fragile thing</l>
     <l n="242">To-day lies on thy breast . To-morrow ’ s wing</l>
     <l n="243">Hath brushed it from thy sight .” Low Lilith sighed :</l>
     <l n="244">“ My Eblis , is this death ?” And louder cried ,</l>
     <l n="245">“ But thou art wise , and sure some hidden way</l>
     <l n="246">From this sore hap canst find . O Eblis , say ,</l>
     <l n="247">Hast thou no spell whereby the child may live ?</l>
     <l n="248">O love , my realm thy recompense I give ,</l>
     <l n="249">If she be healed .”</l>
     <l n="250">“ Nay ; not Archangel ’ s craft</l>
     <l n="251">Stays fleeting life , or turns Death ’ s nimble shaft ,”</l>
     <l n="252">He said . “ Yet if ,” she mused , “ I laid again</l>
     <l n="253">The child in young Eve ’ s arms , like summer rain ,</l>
     <l n="254">The mother ’ s love may yet restore again</l>
     <l n="255">This shriveled life . And yet , must I resign</l>
     <l n="256">The babe ? Alas , my little one ! Nay , mine</l>
     <l n="257">No more !” Weeping she ceased .</l>
     <l n="258">But after , bore</l>
     <l n="259">The child far northward ; the exiled pair o ’ er</l>
     <l n="260">Many lands long seeking . Till from a crest</l>
     <l n="261">Of barren hills Lilith looked down . At rest ,</l>
     <l n="262">The twain she saw , for it was eventide .</l>
     <l n="263">And low they spoke of hidden snares beside</l>
     <l n="264">Their unknown path , since unaware fared they</l>
     <l n="265">Into this hostile spot . The dim wolds lay</l>
     <l n="266">All bare beneath chill stars . And far away</l>
     <l n="267">Were belts of pine , and dingy ocean shore ,</l>
     <l n="268">Like wrinkled lip . Cold was the land , and hoar</l>
     <l n="269">With wintry rime . Near by , its leafless boughs</l>
     <l n="270">A thorn bush bent , with withered berries red .</l>
     <l n="271">At sight thereof Adam , rejoicing , said ,</l>
     <l n="272">“ My Eve , bide here . From yonder friendly tree</l>
     <l n="273">The ripe fruit I will pluck and bring to thee .”</l>
     <l n="274">“ Oh , leave me not ! This solitude I fear ;</l>
     <l n="275">The land about is chill ,” she said , “ and drear</l>
     <l n="276">It seems to me .” But Adam answered , “ Nay ,</l>
     <l n="277">Sore famished art thou , and not far away</l>
     <l n="278">It is — nor long I stay .”</l>
     <l n="279">So parted he .</l>
     <l n="280">Not long alone was Eve . Upstarted she</l>
     <l n="281">Dismayed . A woman , most exceeding fair ,</l>
     <l n="282">Beside her stood , with coils of yellow hair ,</l>
     <l n="283">And blue eyes , calm as sleep among the hills ’</l>
     <l n="284">Dim lakes . Eve , frighted , shrank . As mountain rills ,</l>
     <l n="285">Sweet fell the stranger ’ s words . “ My sister , one</l>
     <l n="286">Is here that glad salutes thee . And since done</l>
     <l n="287">Is now my quest , and here my journey ends ,</l>
     <l n="288">I bring a goodly gift . For elsewhere wends</l>
     <l n="289">My pathway , Eve .</l>
     <l n="290">“ Beside a coppice green ,</l>
     <l n="291">Brighter than gold , purer than silver sheen ,</l>
     <l n="292">In a fair garden , once a jewel shone .</l>
     <l n="293">With it , compared in all the world , no stone .</l>
     <l n="294">And low the Master set it shining clear</l>
     <l n="295">Against the hedge , saying , ‘ When she draws near</l>
     <l n="296">She will perceive on whom I do bestow</l>
     <l n="297">This moteless gem , that fellow doth not know .’</l>
     <l n="298">“ Now I without the copse that day was hid .</l>
     <l n="299">Soft shone the jewel , as the moon amid</l>
     <l n="300">The blue . And in the garden I saw thee ,</l>
     <l n="301">Where in the midst stood a fair wheaten tree</l>
     <l n="302">As emerald green . Its ears , as rubies red ,</l>
     <l n="303">Fragrant as breath of musk , its odors spread .</l>
     <l n="304">And white its shining grains as rifted snow .</l>
     <l n="305">I looked again . And in thy fair hand , lo ,</l>
     <l n="306">Full ripe bright gleamed the yellow wheaten grain .</l>
     <l n="307">Thou saidst , ‘ Though I did eat , I live . No pain</l>
     <l n="308">Hath marred this pleasant feast .’</l>
     <l n="309">“ Then I the more</l>
     <l n="310">Desired thy gem . ‘ All things most goodly pour</l>
     <l n="311">On Eve their gifts . But I am famished lone ,’</l>
     <l n="312">I said . And still against the hedge the stone</l>
     <l n="313">Rayed like a frozen tear the pure Night shed —</l>
     <l n="314">The which with trembling hand I seized , and fled</l>
     <l n="315">Afar .</l>
     <l n="316">“ But now upon my soul weighs sore</l>
     <l n="317">A dream . A voice called loud , ‘ Straightway restore</l>
     <l n="318">To Eve that which is hers ; lest I , that bright</l>
     <l n="319">Set it against the hedge , will quench its light .</l>
     <l n="320">Yea , I will crumble it and quickly smite</l>
     <l n="321">It into dust e ’ en from thy hand .’ Mine eyes</l>
     <l n="322">I careless closed . But yesternight ‘ Arise !’</l>
     <l n="323">The stern voice cried . ‘ Stay not at all . For lo ,</l>
     <l n="324">I wait not . Lest I scourge thee sorely , go !’</l>
     <l n="325">Ah , Eve , though long upon my heart I wore</l>
     <l n="326">This jewel rare , behold , I now restore</l>
     <l n="327">Thine own !”</l>
     <l n="328">Then Eve cried loud , “ Ere my heart break ,</l>
     <l n="329">Give me my babe ! Where is she , for whose sake</l>
     <l n="330">I sorrowed all these years — the little maid ?”</l>
     <l n="331">She said , through tender sobs .</l>
     <l n="332">And Lilith laid</l>
     <l n="333">Apart upon her breast her garment , dyed</l>
     <l n="334">In blended hues . And stooping at Eve ’ s side ,</l>
     <l n="335">Gave back the child .</l>
     <l n="336">As one that ending quest</l>
     <l n="337">Most perilous , safe harbor sees — at rest</l>
     <l n="338">Among green hills — and enters glad therein ,</l>
     <l n="339">So Lilith was .</l>
     <l n="340">So passed she once again</l>
     <l n="341">Into her land .</l>
     <l n="342">But Eve , like rain</l>
     <l n="343">Long pent , upon the child poured swiftly down</l>
     <l n="344">Sweet kisses . And again , twixt laugh and frown</l>
     <l n="345">Divided , smoothed the baby face , and through</l>
     <l n="346">Her fingers soft the silken hair she drew ,</l>
     <l n="347">And kissed again .</l>
     <l n="348">And with a vague surprise</l>
     <l n="349">Recalled the stranger ’ s smile , the mournful eyes ,</l>
     <l n="350">Much marveling whence she fared . And said , “ As pale</l>
     <l n="351">She seemed as bramble-blooms in Eden ’ s vale .”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="352">When homeward Adam came , the child she set</l>
     <l n="353">Upon his knee , saying , “ Erewhile I met</l>
     <l n="354">An angel . So to me she seemed , as there</l>
     <l n="355">She stood . So tall , so yellow-haired , so fair ;</l>
     <l n="356">And lo , she brought again the babe .”</l>
     <l n="357">Therewith</l>
     <l n="358">She ended low . “ Doubtless an angel , love , sith</l>
     <l n="359">So you deem her ,” he replied . And mused on all</l>
     <l n="360">Eve told .</l>
     <l n="361">And watching , saw a shadow fall</l>
     <l n="362">Upon the child . And later , did recall</l>
     <l n="363">Those words , sad pondering “ so fair , so tall .”</l>
     <l n="364">But nothing uttered .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="365">In that land long time</l>
     <l n="366">They lingered . And the child slow faded , till</l>
     <l n="367">One day Eve frighted cried , “ See , Adam , still</l>
     <l n="368">She lies ! Ah , little one , unseal those eyes !</l>
     <l n="369">Rouse but awhile , ere waning daylight flies !”</l>
     <l n="370">For she discerned not yet its doom , nor knew</l>
     <l n="371">The hour was near .</l>
     <l n="372">But Adam , parting , drew</l>
     <l n="373">Beneath the thorn , lest he might see the child .</l>
     <l n="374">And all the lone hours through Eve , babbling , smiled</l>
     <l n="375">Adown . And blew her warm breath o ’ er the cheeks</l>
     <l n="376">So wan . “ The night grows cold ,” she said . “ Sleep creeps</l>
     <l n="377">Dull on my babe . The night grows cold and chill ,”</l>
     <l n="378">She said .</l>
     <l n="379">Nor dreamed aneath those lids closed still ,</l>
     <l n="380">The death film hung .</l>
     <l n="381">A wind uprose , and swept</l>
     <l n="382">Among the dry leaves heaped , where lowly slept</l>
     <l n="383">The child . Cold grew the night and colder , till</l>
     <l n="384">Against the east the dawn glowed daffodil ,</l>
     <l n="385">Above dun wolds white with new-fallen snow .</l>
     <l n="386">So rose the day and widened into morning glow</l>
     <l n="387">With rosy tints o ’ erstreaked , and faintly blurred</l>
     <l n="388">With flecks of cloud .</l>
     <l n="389">Still lay the child , nor stirred .</l>
     <l n="390">Dumb Eve looked down , nor knew Death ’ s pallid masque ,</l>
     <l n="391">And strove to wake the maid . In vain . Her task</l>
     <l n="392">Was done . And as she gazed , a gentle grasp</l>
     <l n="393">Soft loosed the dead from that cold mother ’ s clasp ,</l>
     <l n="394">And Lilith laid the babe in its chill bed —</l>
     <l n="395">Straightened the limbs , and kissed the little head .</l>
     <l n="396">And o ’ er the sleeper , kneeling , she did lean .</l>
     <l n="397">Forth from her breast she drew , close folded , green ,</l>
     <l n="398">A sheath of leaves , bright shining , lustrous — wet</l>
     <l n="399">With tears — that in those waxen hands she set .</l>
     <l n="400">Then those shut leaves oped slow . And low and frail</l>
     <l n="401">Bloomed ’ mid the tintless snows a snow-drop pale .</l>
     <l n="402">Soft Lilith said , “ For this pale sleeper ’ s sake ,</l>
     <l n="403">O Eve , one kiss bestow . E ’ en thou canst take</l>
     <l n="404">Pity on me . For thee new , happy days await ,</l>
     <l n="405">But I — I am forever desolate .</l>
     <l n="406">For thee fresh love will bloom above this mould ;</l>
     <l n="407">For thee , in coming years , pure lips unfold ;</l>
     <l n="408">But I — no more , no more , shall feel the warm</l>
     <l n="409">Breath ’ gainst my breast . Nay , nor the baby arm</l>
     <l n="410">Soft clasping me . Nor see the feet that pass</l>
     <l n="411">Like falling music , through the waving grass .</l>
     <l n="412">Therefore , one pardoning kiss give e ’ er I go</l>
     <l n="413">To my own land , beyond this realm of snow .”</l>
     <l n="414">And Eve , uprising , took the hand she gave ,</l>
     <l n="415">And weeping , kissed ; and parted by that grave .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="416">Stood Adam , after-time , by that small mound .</l>
     <l n="417">Low at their feet a sheaf of leaves Eve found ,</l>
     <l n="418">Wherein white flowers shone . “ Oh , like ,” she said ,</l>
     <l n="419">“ To this was one abloom within the bed</l>
     <l n="420">Where lies the child . And fair , O , passing fair ,</l>
     <l n="421">She was , and tall , with yellow gleaming hair ,</l>
     <l n="422">And cheeks soft flushed as fresh pomegranate bells ;</l>
     <l n="423">And dewy eyes , like violets in the dells ,</l>
     <l n="424">Who came . So , silent passed that stranger fair</l>
     <l n="425">Who loved our babe . And e ’ er I well was ware ,</l>
     <l n="426">She vanished .”</l>
     <l n="427">Otherwhiles , “ Of alien race</l>
     <l n="428">She was ,” Eve said . “ A princess , with a face</l>
     <l n="429">Surpassing fair , who trod the pathway bright</l>
     <l n="430">Among the mists , beyond the rim of night</l>
     <l n="431">To her own land .”</l>
     <l n="432">And oft in after-time ,</l>
     <l n="433">When Cain had lain in her young arms , and chime</l>
     <l n="434">Of voices round her came , and clasp of hands ,</l>
     <l n="435">And thick with baby faces bloomed the lands ,</l>
     <l n="436">Eve silent sat , remembering that one child</l>
     <l n="437">Among the snowdrops , in a Northern wild .</l>
     <l n="438">And Lilith dwelt again in her own land ;</l>
     <l n="439">With Eblis still strayed far . And hand in hand</l>
     <l n="440">They talked ; the while her phantom brood in glee</l>
     <l n="441">Laughed overhead . Then looking on the sea ,</l>
     <l n="442">Low voiced , she sang . So sweet the idle song ,</l>
     <l n="443">She said , “ From Paradise , forgotten long ,</l>
     <l n="444">It comes . An elfin echo that doth rise</l>
     <l n="445">Upward from summer seas to bending skies .</l>
     <l n="446">In coming days , from any earthly shore</l>
     <l n="447">It shall not fail . And sweet forever more</l>
     <l n="448">Shall make my memory . That witching strain</l>
     <l n="449">Pale Lilith ’ s love shall lightly breathe again .</l>
     <l n="450">And Lilith ’ s bitter loss and olden pain</l>

   <p>WRITINGS OF ELLA FARMAN ,</p>
   <p>EDITOR OF WIDE AWAKE .</p>
   <p>Ella Farman teaches art no less than letters ; and what is more than both stimulates a pure imagination and wholesome thinking . In her work there is vastly more culture than in the whole schooling supplied to the average child in the average school .— New York Tribune .</p>
   <p>The authoress , Ella Farman , whose skilful editorial management of “ Wide Awake ” all acquainted with that publication must admire , shows that her great capacity to amuse and instruct our growing youth can take a wider range . Her books are exceedingly interesting , and of that fine moral tone which so many books of the present day lack .— The Times , Canada .</p>
