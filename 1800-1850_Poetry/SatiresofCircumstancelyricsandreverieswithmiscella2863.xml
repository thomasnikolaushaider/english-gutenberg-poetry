      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="2">Plunging and labouring on in a tide of visions ,</l>
       <l n="3">Dolorous and dear ,</l>
       <l n="4">Forward I pushed my way as amid waste waters</l>
       <l n="5">Stretching around ,</l>
       <l n="6">Through whose eddies there glimmered the customed landscape</l>
       <l n="7">Yonder and near ,</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="8">Blotted to feeble mist . And the coomb and the upland</l>
       <l n="9">Foliage-crowned ,</l>
       <l n="10">Ancient chalk-pit , milestone , rills in the grass-flat</l>
       <l n="11">Stroked by the light ,</l>
       <l n="12">Seemed but a ghost-like gauze , and no substantial</l>
       <l n="13">Meadow or mound .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="14">What were the infinite spectacles bulking foremost</l>
       <l n="15">Under my sight ,</l>
       <l n="16">Hindering me to discern my paced advancement</l>
       <l n="17">Lengthening to miles ;</l>
       <l n="18">What were the re-creations killing the daytime</l>
       <l n="19">As by the night ?</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="20">O they were speechful faces , gazing insistent ,</l>
       <l n="21">Some as with smiles ,</l>
       <l n="22">Some as with slow-born tears that brinily trundled</l>
       <l n="23">Over the wrecked</l>
       <l n="24">Cheeks that were fair in their flush-time , ash now with anguish ,</l>
       <l n="25">Harrowed by wiles .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="26">Yes , I could see them , feel them , hear them , address them -</l>
       <l n="27">Halo-bedecked -</l>
       <l n="28">And , alas , onwards , shaken by fierce unreason ,</l>
       <l n="29">Rigid in hate ,</l>
       <l n="30">Smitten by years-long wryness born of misprision ,</l>
       <l n="31">Dreaded , suspect .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="32">Then there would breast me shining sights , sweet seasons</l>
       <l n="33">Further in date ;</l>
       <l n="34">Instruments of strings with the tenderest passion</l>
       <l n="35">Vibrant , beside</l>
       <l n="36">Lamps long extinguished , robes , cheeks , eyes with the earth 's crust</l>
       <l n="37">Now corporate .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="38">Also there rose a headland of hoary aspect</l>
       <l n="39">Gnawed by the tide ,</l>
       <l n="40">Frilled by the nimb of the morning as two friends stood there</l>
       <l n="41">Guilelessly glad -</l>
       <l n="42">Wherefore they knew not — touched by the fringe of an ecstasy</l>
       <l n="43">Scantly descried .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="9">
       <l n="44">Later images too did the day unfurl me ,</l>
       <l n="45">Shadowed and sad ,</l>
       <l n="46">Clay cadavers of those who had shared in the dramas ,</l>
       <l n="47">Laid now at ease ,</l>
       <l n="48">Passions all spent , chiefest the one of the broad brow</l>
       <l n="49">Sepulture-clad .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="10">
       <l n="50">So did beset me scenes miscalled of the bygone ,</l>
       <l n="51">Over the leaze ,</l>
       <l n="52">Past the clump , and down to where lay the beheld ones ;</l>
       <l n="53">— Yea , as the rhyme</l>
       <l n="54">Sung by the sea-swell , so in their pleading dumbness</l>
       <l n="55">Captured me these .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="11">
       <l n="56">For , their lost revisiting manifestations</l>
       <l n="57">In their own time</l>
       <l n="58">Much had I slighted , caring not for their purport ,</l>
       <l n="59">Seeing behind</l>
       <l n="60">Things more coveted , reckoned the better worth calling</l>
       <l n="61">Sweet , sad , sublime .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="12">
       <l n="62">Thus do they now show hourly before the intenser</l>
       <l n="63">Stare of the mind</l>
       <l n="64">As they were ghosts avenging their slights by my bypast</l>
       <l n="65">Body-borne eyes ,</l>
       <l n="66">Show , too , with fuller translation than rested upon them</l>
       <l n="67">As living kind .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="13">
       <l n="68">Hence wag the tongues of the passing people , saying</l>
       <l n="69">In their surmise ,</l>
       <l n="70">“ Ah — whose is this dull form that perambulates , seeing nought</l>
       <l n="71">Round him that looms</l>
       <l n="72">Whithersoever his footsteps turn in his farings ,</l>
       <l n="73">Save a few tombs ? ”</l>

      <head>CHANNEL FIRING</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">That night your great guns , unawares ,</l>
       <l n="2">Shook all our coffins as we lay ,</l>
       <l n="3">And broke the chancel window-squares ,</l>
       <l n="4">We thought it was the Judgment-day</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="5">And sat upright . While drearisome</l>
       <l n="6">Arose the howl of wakened hounds :</l>
       <l n="7">The mouse let fall the altar-crumb ,</l>
       <l n="8">The worms drew back into the mounds ,</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="9">The glebe cow drooled . Till God called , “ No ;</l>
       <l n="10">It 's gunnery practice out at sea</l>
       <l n="11">Just as before you went below ;</l>
       <l n="12">The world is as it used to be :</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="13">“ All nations striving strong to make</l>
       <l n="14">Red war yet redder . Mad as hatters</l>
       <l n="15">They do no more for Christes sake</l>
       <l n="16">Than you who are helpless in such matters .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="17">“ That this is not the judgment-hour</l>
       <l n="18">For some of them 's a blessed thing ,</l>
       <l n="19">For if it were they 'd have to scour</l>
       <l n="20">Hell 's floor for so much threatening . . .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="21">“ Ha , ha . It will be warmer when</l>
       <l n="22">I blow the trumpet ( if indeed</l>
       <l n="23">I ever do ; for you are men ,</l>
       <l n="24">And rest eternal sorely need ) . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="25">So down we lay again . “ I wonder ,</l>
       <l n="26">Will the world ever saner be , ”</l>
       <l n="27">Said one , “ than when He sent us under</l>
       <l n="28">In our indifferent century ! ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="29">And many a skeleton shook his head .</l>
       <l n="30">“ Instead of preaching forty year , ”</l>
       <l n="31">My neighbour Parson Thirdly said ,</l>
       <l n="32">“ I wish I had stuck to pipes and beer . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="9">
       <l n="33">Again the guns disturbed the hour ,</l>
       <l n="34">Roaring their readiness to avenge ,</l>
       <l n="35">As far inland as Stourton Tower ,</l>
       <l n="36">And Camelot , and starlit Stonehenge .</l>

       <l n="30">In the burn of August , to paint the scene ,</l>
       <l n="31">And we placed our basket of fruit and wine</l>
       <l n="32">By the runlet 's rim , where we sat to dine ;</l>
       <l n="33">And when we had drunk from the glass together ,</l>
       <l n="34">Arched by the oak-copse from the weather ,</l>
       <l n="35">I held the vessel to rinse in the fall ,</l>
       <l n="36">Where it slipped , and sank , and was past recall ,</l>
       <l n="37">Though we stooped and plumbed the little abyss</l>
       <l n="38">With long bared arms . There the glass still is .</l>
       <l n="39">And , as said , if I thrust my arm below</l>
       <l n="40">Cold water in basin or bowl , a throe</l>
       <l n="41">From the past awakens a sense of that time ,</l>
       <l n="42">And the glass both used , and the cascade 's rhyme .</l>
       <l n="43">The basin seems the pool , and its edge</l>
       <l n="44">The hard smooth face of the brook-side ledge ,</l>
       <l n="45">And the leafy pattern of china-ware</l>
       <l n="46">The hanging plants that were bathing there .</l>
       <l n="47">By night , by day , when it shines or lours ,</l>
       <l n="48">There lies intact that chalice of ours ,</l>
       <l n="49">And its presence adds to the rhyme of love</l>
       <l n="50">Persistently sung by the fall above .</l>
       <l n="51">No lip has touched it since his and mine</l>
       <l n="52">In turns therefrom sipped lovers ’ wine . ”</l>

       <l n="1">Why did you give no hint that night</l>

       <l n="3">And calmly , as if indifferent quite ,</l>
       <l n="4">You would close your term here , up and be gone</l>
       <l n="5">Where I could not follow</l>
       <l n="6">With wing of swallow</l>

       <l n="12">Unmoved , unknowing</l>

       <l n="18">Where so often at dusk you used to be ;</l>
       <l n="19">Till in darkening dankness</l>

      <head>YOUR LAST DRIVE</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">Here by the moorway you returned ,</l>

       <l n="7">And on your left you passed the spot</l>

       <l n="9">And be spoken of as one who was not ;</l>
       <l n="10">Beholding it with a cursory eye</l>
       <l n="11">As alien from you , though under its tree</l>
       <l n="12">You soon would halt everlastingly .</l>

       <l n="13">I drove not with you . . . Yet had I sat</l>

       <l n="15">That the countenance I was glancing at</l>
       <l n="16">Had a last-time look in the flickering sheen ,</l>
       <l n="17">Nor have read the writing upon your face ,</l>

       <l n="22">There never at all . And I shall not care .</l>

       <l n="27">Dear ghost , in the past did you ever find</l>
       <l n="28">The thought “ What profit ? ” move me much</l>
       <l n="29">Yet the fact indeed remains the same ,</l>
       <l n="30">You are past love , praise , indifference , blame .</l>

   <note>POSTSCRIPT “ MEN WHO MARCH AWAY ” ( SONG OF THE SOLDIERS ) What of the faith and fire within us Men who march away Ere the barn-cocks say Night is growing gray , To hazards whence no tears can win us ; What of the faith and fire within us Men who march away ? Is it a purblind prank , O think you , Friend with the musing eye , Who watch us stepping by With doubt and dolorous sigh ? Can much pondering so hoodwink you ! Is it a purblind prank , O think you , Friend with the musing eye ? Nay . We well see what we are doing , Though some may not see -  Dalliers as they be -  England 's need are we ; Her distress would leave us rueing : Nay . We well see what we are doing , Though some may not see ! In our heart of hearts believing Victory crowns the just , And that braggarts must Surely bite the dust , Press we to the field ungrieving , In our heart of hearts believing Victory crowns the just . Hence the faith and fire within us Men who march away Ere the barn-cocks say Night is growing gray , To hazards whence no tears can win us : Hence the faith and fire within us Men who march away .
