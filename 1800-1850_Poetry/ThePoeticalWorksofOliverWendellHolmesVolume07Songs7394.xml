    <head>DOROTHY Q .</head>
    <head>A FAMILY PORTRAIT</head>
    <head>I cannot tell the story of Dorothy Q. more simply in prose than I have told it in verse , but I can add something to it . Dorothy was the daughter of Judge Edmund Quincy , and the niece of Josiah Quincy , junior , the young patriot and orator who died just before the American Revolution , of which he was one of the most eloquent and effective promoters . The son of the latter , Josiah Quincy , the first mayor of Boston bearing that name , lived to a great age , one of the most useful and honored citizens of his time . The canvas of the painting was so much decayed that it had to be replaced by a new one , in doing which the rapier thrust was of course filled up .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">GRANDMOTHER 'S mother : her age , I guess ,</l>
     <l n="2">Thirteen summers , or something less ;</l>
     <l n="3">Girlish bust , but womanly air ;</l>
     <l n="4">Smooth , square forehead with uprolled hair ;</l>
     <l n="5">Lips that lover has never kissed ;</l>
     <l n="6">Taper fingers and slender wrist ;</l>
     <l n="7">Hanging sleeves of stiff brocade ;</l>
     <l n="8">So they painted the little maid .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">On her hand a parrot green</l>
     <l n="10">Sits unmoving and broods serene .</l>
     <l n="11">Hold up the canvas full in view ,—</l>
     <l n="12">Look ! there 's a rent the light shines through ,</l>
     <l n="13">Dark with a century 's fringe of dust ,—</l>
     <l n="14">That was a Red-Coat 's rapier-thrust !</l>
     <l n="15">Such is the tale the lady old ,</l>
     <l n="16">Dorothy 's daughter 's daughter , told .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="17">Who the painter was none may tell ,—</l>
     <l n="18">One whose best was not over well ;</l>
     <l n="19">Hard and dry , it must be confessed ,</l>
     <l n="20">Flat as a rose that has long been pressed ;</l>
     <l n="21">Yet in her cheek the hues are bright ,</l>
     <l n="22">Dainty colors of red and white ,</l>
     <l n="23">And in her slender shape are seen</l>
     <l n="24">Hint and promise of stately mien .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="25">Look not on her with eyes of scorn ,—</l>
     <l n="26">Dorothy Q. was a lady born !</l>
     <l n="27">Ay ! since the galloping Normans came ,</l>
     <l n="28">England 's annals have known her name ;</l>
     <l n="29">And still to the three-billed rebel town</l>
     <l n="30">Dear is that ancient name 's renown ,</l>
     <l n="31">For many a civic wreath they won ,</l>
     <l n="32">The youthful sire and the gray-haired son .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="33">O Damsel Dorothy ! Dorothy Q .!</l>
     <l n="34">Strange is the gift that I owe to you ;</l>
     <l n="35">Such a gift as never a king</l>
     <l n="36">Save to daughter or son might bring ,—</l>
     <l n="37">All my tenure of heart and hand ,</l>
     <l n="38">All my title to house and land ;</l>
     <l n="39">Mother and sister and child and wife</l>
     <l n="40">And joy and sorrow and death and life !</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="41">What if a hundred years ago</l>
     <l n="42">Those close-shut lips had answered No ,</l>
     <l n="43">When forth the tremulous question came</l>
     <l n="44">That cost the maiden her Norman name ,</l>
     <l n="45">And under the folds that look so still</l>
     <l n="46">The bodice swelled with the bosom 's thrill ?</l>
     <l n="47">Should I be I , or would it be</l>
     <l n="48">One tenth another , to nine tenths me ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="49">Soft is the breath of a maiden 's YES</l>
     <l n="50">Not the light gossamer stirs with less ;</l>
     <l n="51">But never a cable that holds so fast</l>
     <l n="52">Through all the battles of wave and blast ,</l>
     <l n="53">And never an echo of speech or song</l>
     <l n="54">That lives in the babbling air so long !</l>
     <l n="55">There were tones in the voice that whispered then</l>
     <l n="56">You may hear to-day in a hundred men .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="57">O lady and lover , how faint and far</l>
     <l n="58">Your images hover ,— and here we are ,</l>

     <l n="60">Edward 's and Dorothy 's — all their own ,—</l>
     <l n="61">A goodly record for Time to show</l>
     <l n="62">Of a syllable spoken so long ago !—</l>
     <l n="63">Shall I bless you , Dorothy , or forgive</l>
     <l n="64">For the tender whisper that bade me live ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="65">It shall be a blessing , my little maid !</l>
     <l n="66">I will heal the stab of the Red-Coat 's blade ,</l>
     <l n="67">And freshen the gold of the tarnished frame ,</l>
     <l n="68">And gild with a rhyme your household name ;</l>
     <l n="69">So you shall smile on us brave and bright</l>
     <l n="70">As first you greeted the morning 's light ,</l>
     <l n="71">And live untroubled by woes and fears</l>
     <l n="72">Through a second youth of a hundred years .</l>

     <l n="1">ONE word to the guest we have gathered to greet !</l>
     <l n="2">The echoes are longing that word to repeat ,—</l>
     <l n="3">It springs to the lips that are waiting to part ,</l>

     <l n="5">Its accents may vary , its sound may be strange ,</l>

     <l n="9">That word ! How it gladdened the Pilgrim yore ,</l>
     <l n="10">As he stood in the snow on the desolate shore !</l>
     <l n="11">When the shout of the sagamore startled his ear</l>
     <l n="12">In the phrase of the Saxon , ‘ t was music to hear !</l>

     <l n="17">The tribe of the sachem has melted away ,</l>

     <l n="37">But ours is the region of arctic delight ;</l>

     <l n="41">The flowers are full-blown in the garlanded hall ,—</l>
     <l n="42">They will bloom round his footsteps wherever they fall ;</l>
     <l n="43">For the splendors of youth and the sunshine they bring</l>
     <l n="44">Make the roses believe ‘ t is the summons of Spring .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="45">One word of our language he needs must know well ,</l>
     <l n="46">But another remains that is harder to spell ;</l>

     <l n="48">How we utter Farewell , he will have to return !</l>

     <l n="1">Cabin Passenger . Man at Wheel .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>CABIN PASSENGER . FRIEND , you seem thoughtful . I not wonder much That he who sails the ocean should be sad . I am myself reflective . When I think Of all this wallowing beast , the Sea , has sucked Between his sharp , thin lips , the wedgy waves , What heaps of diamonds , rubies , emeralds , pearls ; What piles of shekels , talents , ducats , crowns , What bales of Tyrian mantles , Indian shawls , Of laces that have blanked the weavers ’ eyes , Of silken tissues , wrought by worm and man , The half-starved workman , and the well-fed worm ; What marbles , bronzes , pictures , parchments , books ; What many-lobuled , thought-engendering brains ; Lie with the gaping sea-shells in his maw ,— I , too , am silent ; for all language seems A mockery , and the speech of man is vain . O mariner , we look upon the waves And they rebuke our babbling . “ Peace ! ” they say ,— “ Mortal , be still ! ” My noisy tongue is hushed , And with my trembling finger on my lips My soul exclaims in ecstasy —</p>
   <p>MAN AT WHEEL . Belay !</p>
   <p>CABIN PASSENGER . Ah yes ! “ Delay , ” — it calls , “ nor haste to break The charm of stillness with an idle word ! ” O mariner , I love thee , for thy thought Strides even with my own , nay , flies before . Thou art a brother to the wind and wave ; Have they not music for thine ear as mine , When the wild tempest makes thy ship his lyre , Smiting a cavernous basso from the shrouds And climbing up his gamut through the stays , Through buntlines , bowlines , ratlines , till it shrills An alto keener than the locust sings , And all the great Aeolian orchestra Storms out its mad sonata in the gale ? Is not the scene a wondrous and —</p>
   <p>MAN AT WHEEL . A vast !</p>
   <p>CABIN PASSENGER . Ah yes , a vast , a vast and wondrous scene ! I see thy soul is open as the day That holds the sunshine in its azure bowl To all the solemn glories of the deep . Tell me , O mariner , dost thou never feel The grandeur of thine office ,— to control The keel that cuts the ocean like a knife And leaves a wake behind it like a seam In the great shining garment of the world ?</p>
   <p>MAN AT WHEEL . Belay y'r jaw , y ’ swab ! y ’ hoss-marine ! ( To the Captain . ) Ay , ay , Sir ! Stiddy , Sir ! Sou'wes ’ b ’ sou ’ !</p>
