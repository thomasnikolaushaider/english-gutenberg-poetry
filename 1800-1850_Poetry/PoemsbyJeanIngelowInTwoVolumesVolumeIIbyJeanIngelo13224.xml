    <docTitle><titlePart>POEMS BY JEAN INGELOW VOLUME II . TO JEAN INGELOW . When youth was high , and life was new And days sped musical and fleet , She stood amid the morning dew , And sang her earliest measures sweet ,— Sang as the lark sings , speeding fair To touch and taste the purer air , To gain a nearer view of Heaven ; ‘ Twas then she sang “ The Songs of Seven . ” Now , farther on in womanhood , With trainèd voice and ripened art , She gently stands where once she stood , And sings from out her deeper heart . Sing on , dear Singer ! sing again ; And we will listen to the strain , Till soaring earth greets bending Heaven , And seven-fold songs grow seventy-seven .

     <l n="2">‘ One soweth and another reapeth . ’</l>
     <l n="3">Ay ,</l>
     <l n="4">Too true , too true . One soweth — unaware</l>
     <l n="5">Cometh a reaper stealthily while he dreams —</l>
     <l n="6">Bindeth the golden sheaf , and in his bosom</l>
     <l n="7">As ‘ t were between the dewfall and the dawn</l>
     <l n="8">Bears it away . Who other was to blame ?</l>
     <l n="9">Is it I ? Is it I ?— No verily , not I ,</l>
     <l n="10">‘ T was a good action , and I smart therefore ;</l>
     <l n="11">Oblivion of a righteous enmity</l>
     <l n="12">Wrought me this wrong . I pay with my self ruth</l>
     <l n="13">That I had ruth toward mine enemy ;</l>
     <l n="14">It needed not to slay mine enemy ,</l>
     <l n="15">Only to let him lie and succourless</l>
     <l n="16">Drift to the foot o ’ the Everlasting Throne ;</l>
     <l n="17">Being mine enemy , he had not accused</l>
     <l n="18">One of my nation there of unkind deeds</l>
     <l n="19">Or ought the way of war forbids .</l>
     <l n="20">Let be !</l>
     <l n="21">I will not think upon it . Yet she was —</l>
     <l n="22">O , she was dear ; my dutiful , dear child .</l>
     <l n="23">One soweth — Nay , but I will tell this out ,</l>
     <l n="24">The first fyte was the best , I call it such</l>
     <l n="25">For now as some old song men think on it .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="26">I dwell where England narrows running north ;</l>
     <l n="27">And while our hay was cut came rumours up</l>
     <l n="28">Humming and swarming round our heads like bees :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="29">‘ Drake from the bay of Cadiz hath come home ,</l>
     <l n="30">And they are forth , the Spaniards with a force</l>
     <l n="31">Invincible . ’</l>
     <l n="32">‘ The Prince of Parma , couched</l>
     <l n="33">At Dunkirk , e'en by torchlight makes to toil</l>
     <l n="34">His shipwright thousands — thousands in the ports</l>
     <l n="35">Of Flanders and Brabant . An hundred hendes</l>
     <l n="36">Transports to his great squadron adding , all</l>
     <l n="37">For our confusion . ’</l>
     <l n="38">‘ England 's great ally</l>
     <l n="39">Henry of France , by insurrection fallen ,</l>
     <l n="40">Of him the said Prince Parma mocking cries ,</l>
     <l n="41">He shall not help the Queen of England now</l>
     <l n="42">Not even with his tears , more needing them</l>
     <l n="43">To weep his own misfortune . ’</l>
     <l n="44">Was that all</l>
     <l n="45">The truth ? Not half , and yet it was enough</l>
     <l n="46">( Albeit not half that half was well believed ) ,</l>
     <l n="47">For all the land stirred in the half belief</l>
     <l n="48">As dreamers stir about to wake ; and now</l>
     <l n="49">Comes the Queen 's message , all her lieges bid</l>
     <l n="50">To rise , ‘ lieftenants , and the better sort</l>
     <l n="51">Of gentlemen ’ whereby the Queen 's grace meant ,</l>
     <l n="52">As it may seem the sort that willed to rise</l>
     <l n="53">And arm , and come to aid her .</l>
     <l n="54">Distance wrought</l>
     <l n="55">Safety for us , my neighbours and near friends ,</l>
     <l n="56">The peril lay along our channel coast</l>
     <l n="57">And marked the city , undefended fair</l>
     <l n="58">Rich London . O to think of Spanish mail</l>
     <l n="59">Ringing — of riotous conquerors in her street ,</l>
     <l n="60">Chasing and frighting ( would there were no more</l>
     <l n="61">To think on ) her fair wives and her fair maids .</l>
     <l n="62">— But hope is fain to deem them forth of her .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="63">Then Spain to the sacking ; then they tear away</l>
     <l n="64">Arras and carvèd work . O then they break</l>
     <l n="65">And toss , and mar her quaint orfèverie</l>
     <l n="66">Priceless — then split the wine kegs , spill the mead ,</l>
     <l n="67">Trail out the pride of ages in the dust ;</l>
     <l n="68">Turn over with pikes her silken merchandise ,</l>
     <l n="69">Strip off the pictures of her kings , and spoil</l>
     <l n="70">Their palaces that nigh five hundred years</l>
     <l n="71">Have rued no alien footsteps on the floor ,</l>
     <l n="72">And work — for the days of miracle are gone —</l>
     <l n="73">All unimaginable waste and woe .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="74">Some cried , ‘ But England hath the better cause ;</l>
     <l n="75">We think not those good days indeed are done ;</l>
     <l n="76">We look to Heaven for aid on England 's side . ’</l>
     <l n="77">Then other , ‘ Nay , the harvest is above ,</l>
     <l n="78">God comforts there His own , and ill men leaves</l>
     <l n="79">To run long scores up in this present world ,</l>
     <l n="80">And pay in another .</l>
     <l n="81">Look not here for aid .</l>
     <l n="82">Latimer , poor old saint , died in the street</l>
     <l n="83">With nigh , men say , three hundred of his kind ,</l>
     <l n="84">All bid to look for worse death after death ,</l>
     <l n="85">Succourless , comfortless , unfriended , curst .</l>
     <l n="86">Mary , and Gardiner , and the Pope 's man Pole</l>
     <l n="87">Died upon down , lulled in a silken shade ,</l>
     <l n="88">Soothed with assurance of a waiting heaven ,</l>
     <l n="89">And Peter peering through the golden gate ,</l>
     <l n="90">With his gold key in ‘ s hand to let them in . ’</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="91">‘ Nay , leave , ’ quoth I , ‘ the martyrs to their heaven ,</l>
     <l n="92">And all who live the better that they died .</l>
     <l n="93">But look you now , a nation hath no heaven ,</l>
     <l n="94">A nation 's life and work and wickedness</l>
     <l n="95">And punishment — or otherwise , I say</l>
     <l n="96">A nation 's life and goodness and reward</l>
     <l n="97">Are here . And in my nation 's righteous cause</l>
     <l n="98">I look for aid , and cry , SO HELP ME GOD</l>
     <l n="99">As I will help my righteous nation now</l>
     <l n="100">With all the best I have , and know , and am ,</l>
     <l n="101">I trust Thou wilt not let her light be quenched ;</l>
     <l n="102">I go to aid , and if I fall — I fall ,</l>
     <l n="103">And , God of nations , leave my soul to Thee . ’</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="104">Many did say like words , and all would give</l>
     <l n="105">Of gold , of weapons , and of horses that</l>
     <l n="106">They had to hand or on the spur o ’ the time</l>
     <l n="107">Could gather . My fair dame did sell her rings ,</l>
     <l n="108">So others . And they sent us well equipped</l>
     <l n="109">Who minded to be in the coming fray</l>
     <l n="110">Whether by land or sea ; my hope the last ,</l>
     <l n="111">For I of old therewith was conversant .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="112">Then as we rode down southward all the land</l>
     <l n="113">Was at her harvesting . The oats were cut</l>
     <l n="114">Ere we were three days down , and then the wheat ,</l>
     <l n="115">And the wide country spite of loathèd threat</l>
     <l n="116">Was busy . There was news to hearten us :</l>
     <l n="117">The Hollanders were coming roundly in</l>
     <l n="118">With sixty ships of war , all fierce , and full</l>
     <l n="119">Of spleen , for not alone our sake but theirs</l>
     <l n="120">Willing to brave encounter where they might .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="121">So after five days we did sight the Sound ,</l>
     <l n="122">And look on Plymouth harbour from the hill .</l>
     <l n="123">Then I full glad drew bridle , lighted straight ,</l>
     <l n="124">Ran down and mingled with a waiting crowd .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="125">Many stood gazing on the level deep</l>
     <l n="126">That scarce did tremble ; ‘ t was in hue as sloes</l>
     <l n="127">That hang till winter on a leafless bough ,</l>
     <l n="128">So black bulged down upon it a great cloud</l>
     <l n="129">And probed it through and through with forkèd stabs</l>
     <l n="130">Incessant , and rolled on it thunder bursts</l>
     <l n="131">Till the dark water lowered as one afraid .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="132">That was afar . The land and nearer sea</l>
     <l n="133">Lay sweltering in hot sunshine . The brown beach</l>
     <l n="134">Scarce whispered , for a soft incoming tide</l>
     <l n="135">Was gentle with it . Green the water lapped</l>
     <l n="136">And sparkled at all edges . The night-heavens</l>
     <l n="137">Are not more thickly speckled o'er with stars</l>
     <l n="138">Than that fair harbour with its fishing craft .</l>
     <l n="139">And crowds of galleys shooting to and fro</l>
     <l n="140">Did feed the ships of war with their stout crews ,</l>
     <l n="141">And bear aboard fresh water , furniture</l>
     <l n="142">Of war , much lesser victual , sallets , fruit ,</l>
     <l n="143">All manner equipment for the squadron , sails ,</l>
     <l n="144">Long spars .</l>
     <l n="145">Also was chaffering on the Hoe ,</l>
     <l n="146">Buying and bargaining , taking of leave</l>
     <l n="147">With tears and kisses , while on all hands pushed</l>
     <l n="148">Tall lusty men with baskets on their heads</l>
     <l n="149">Piled of fresh bread , and biscuit newly drawn .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="150">Then shouts , ‘ The captains ! ’</l>
     <l n="151">Raleigh , Hawkins , Drake ,</l>
     <l n="152">Old Martin Frobisher , and many more ;</l>
     <l n="153">Howard , the Lord High Admiral , headed them —</l>
     <l n="154">They coming leisurely from the bowling green ,</l>
     <l n="155">Elbowed their way . For in their stoutness loth</l>
     <l n="156">To hurry when ill news first brake on them ,</l>
     <l n="157">They playing a match ashore — ill news I say ,</l>
     <l n="158">‘ The Spaniards are toward ’ — while panic-struck</l>
     <l n="159">The people ran about them , Drake cries out ,</l>
     <l n="160">Knowing their fear should make the danger worse ,</l>
     <l n="161">‘ Spaniards , my masters ! Let the Spaniards wait .</l>
     <l n="162">Fall not a-shouting for the boats ; is time</l>
     <l n="163">To play the match out , ay to win , and then</l>
     <l n="164">To beat the Spaniards . ’</l>
     <l n="165">So the rest gave way</l>
     <l n="166">At his insistance , playing that afternoon</l>
     <l n="167">The bravest match ( one saith ) was ever scored .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="168">‘ T was no time lost ; nay , not a moment lost ;</l>
     <l n="169">For look you , when the winning cast was made ,</l>
     <l n="170">The town was calm , the anchors were all up ,</l>
     <l n="171">The boats were manned to row them each to his ship ,</l>
     <l n="172">The lowering cloud in the offing had gone south</l>
     <l n="173">Against the wind , and all was work , stir , heed ,</l>
     <l n="174">Nothing forgot , nor grudged , nor slurred , and most</l>
     <l n="175">Men easy at heart as those brave sailors seemed .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="176">And specially the women had put by</l>
     <l n="177">On a sudden their deep dread ; yon Cornish coast</l>
     <l n="178">Neared of his insolency by the foe ,</l>
     <l n="179">With his high seacastles numerous , seaforts</l>
     <l n="180">Many , his galleys out of number , manned</l>
     <l n="181">Each by three hundred slaves chained to the oar ;</l>
     <l n="182">All his strong fleet of lesser ships , but great</l>
     <l n="183">As any of ours — why that same Cornish coast</l>
     <l n="184">Might have lain farther than the far west land ,</l>
     <l n="185">So had a few stout-hearted looks and words</l>
     <l n="186">Wasted the meaning , chilled the menace of</l>
     <l n="187">That frightful danger , imminent , hard at hand .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="188">‘ The captains come , the captains ! ’ and I turned</l>
     <l n="189">As they drew on . I marked the urgency</l>
     <l n="190">Flashing in each man 's eye : fain to be forth</l>
     <l n="191">But willing to be held at leisure . Then</l>
     <l n="192">Cried a fair woman of the better sort</l>
     <l n="193">To Howard , passing by her pannier 'd ass ,</l>
     <l n="194">‘ Apples , Lord Admiral , good captains all ,</l>
     <l n="195">Look you , red apples sharp and sweet are these , ’</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="196">Quoth he a little chafed , ‘ Let be , let be ,</l>
     <l n="197">No time is this for bargaining , good dame .</l>
     <l n="198">Let be ; ’ and pushing past , ‘ Beshrew thy heart</l>
     <l n="199">( And mine that I should say it ) , bargain ! nay .</l>
     <l n="200">I meant not bargaining , ’ she falters ; crying ,</l>
     <l n="201">‘ I brought them my poor gift . Pray you now take ,</l>
     <l n="202">Pray you . ’</l>
     <l n="203">He stops , and with a childlike smile</l>

     <l n="767">‘ Plucked from the death , wilt thou repay me thus ?</l>
     <l n="768">It is but three times thou hast set thine eyes</l>

     <l n="770">And I , not willing to be so withstood ,</l>
     <l n="771">Spoke roughly to her . Then the Spaniard 's eyes</l>
     <l n="772">Blazed — then he stormed at me in his own tongue ,</l>
     <l n="773">And all his Spanish arrogance and pride</l>
     <l n="774">Broke witless on my wrathful English . Then</l>
     <l n="775">He let me know , for I perceived it well ,</l>
     <l n="776">He reckon 'd him mine equal , thought foul scorn</l>
     <l n="777">Of my displeasure , and was wroth with me</l>
     <l n="778">As I with him . ‘ Father , ’ sighed Rosamund .</l>
     <l n="779">‘ Go , get thee to thy mother , girl , ’ quoth I .</l>
     <l n="780">And slowly , slowly , she betook herself</l>
     <l n="781">Down the long hall ; in lowly wise she went</l>
     <l n="782">And made her moans .</l>
     <l n="783">But when my girl was gone</l>
     <l n="784">I stood at fault , th ’ occasion master 'd me ;</l>
     <l n="785">Belike it master 'd him , for both felt mute .</l>
     <l n="786">I calmed me , and he calmed him as he might .</l>
     <l n="787">For I bethought me I was yet an host ,</l>
     <l n="788">And he bethought him on the worthiness</l>

     <l n="790">So made I sign to him .</l>
     <l n="791">The tide was up , and soon I had him forth ,</l>

    <head>ECHO AND THE FERRY .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Ay , Oliver ! I was but seven , and he was eleven ;</l>
     <l n="2">He looked at me pouting and rosy . I blushed where I stood .</l>
     <l n="3">They had told us to play in the orchard ( and I only seven !</l>
     <l n="4">A small guest at the farm ) ; but he said , ‘ Oh , a girl was no good ! ’</l>
     <l n="5">So he whistled and went , he went over the stile to the wood .</l>
     <l n="6">It was sad , it was sorrowful ! Only a girl — only seven !</l>
     <l n="7">At home in the dark London smoke I had not found it out .</l>
     <l n="8">The pear-trees looked on in their white , and blue birds flash 'd about ,</l>
     <l n="9">And they too were angry as Oliver . Were they eleven ?</l>
     <l n="10">I thought so . Yes , everyone else was eleven — eleven !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="11">So Oliver went , but the cowslips were tall at my feet ,</l>
     <l n="12">And all the white orchard with fast-falling blossom was litter 'd ;</l>
     <l n="13">And under and over the branches those little birds twitter 'd ,</l>
     <l n="14">While hanging head downwards they scolded because I was seven .</l>
     <l n="15">A pity . A very great pity . One should be eleven .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="16">But soon I was happy , the smell of the world was so sweet ,</l>
     <l n="17">And I saw a round hole in an apple-tree rosy and old .</l>
     <l n="18">Then I knew ! for I peeped , and I felt it was right they should scold !</l>
     <l n="19">Eggs small and eggs many . For gladness I broke into laughter ;</l>
     <l n="20">And then some one else — oh , how softly !— came after , came after</l>
     <l n="21">With laughter — with laughter came after .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="22">And no one was near us to utter that sweet mocking call ,</l>
     <l n="23">That soon very tired sank low with a mystical fall .</l>
     <l n="24">But this was the country — perhaps it was close under heaven ;</l>
     <l n="25">Oh , nothing so likely ; the voice might have come from it even .</l>
     <l n="26">I knew about heaven . But this was the country , of this</l>
     <l n="27">Light , blossom , and piping , and flashing of wings not at all .</l>
     <l n="28">Not at all . No . But one little bird was an easy forgiver :</l>
     <l n="29">She peeped , she drew near as I moved from her domicile small ,</l>
     <l n="30">Then flashed down her hole like a dart — like a dart from the quiver .</l>
     <l n="31">And I waded atween the long grasses and felt it was bliss .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="32">— So this was the country ; clear dazzle of azure and shiver</l>
     <l n="33">And whisper of leaves , and a humming all over the tall</l>
     <l n="34">White branches , a humming of bees . And I came to the wall —</l>
     <l n="35">A little low wall — and looked over , and there was the river ,</l>
     <l n="36">The lane that led on to the village , and then the sweet river</l>
     <l n="37">Clear shining and slow , she had far far to go from her snow ;</l>
     <l n="38">But each rush gleamed a sword in the sunlight to guard her long flow ,</l>
     <l n="39">And she murmur 'd , methought , with a speech very soft — very low .</l>
     <l n="40">‘ The ways will be long , but the days will be long , ’ quoth the river ,</l>
     <l n="41">‘ To me a long liver , long , long ! ’ quoth the river — the river .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="42">I dreamed of the country that night , of the orchard , the sky ,</l>
     <l n="43">The voice that had mocked coming after and over and under .</l>
     <l n="44">But at last — in a day or two namely — Eleven and I</l>
     <l n="45">Were very fast friends , and to him I confided the wonder .</l>
     <l n="46">He said that was Echo . ‘ Was Echo a wise kind of bee</l>
     <l n="47">That had learned how to laugh : could it laugh in one 's ear and then fly</l>
     <l n="48">And laugh again yonder ? ’ ‘ No ; Echo ’ — he whispered it low —</l>
     <l n="49">‘ Was a woman , they said , but a woman whom no one could see</l>
     <l n="50">And no one could find ; and he did not believe it , not he ,</l>
     <l n="51">But he could not get near for the river that held us asunder .</l>
     <l n="52">Yet I that had money — a shilling , a whole silver shilling —</l>
     <l n="53">We might cross if I thought I would spend it . ’ ‘ Oh yes , I was willing ’ —</l>
     <l n="54">And we ran hand in hand , we ran down to the ferry , the ferry ,</l>
     <l n="55">And we heard how she mocked at the folk with a voice clear and merry</l>
     <l n="56">When they called for the ferry ; but oh ! she was very — was very</l>
     <l n="57">Swift-footed . She spoke and was gone ; and when Oliver cried ,</l>
     <l n="58">‘ Hie over ! hie over ! you man of the ferry — the ferry ! ’</l>
     <l n="59">By the still water 's side she was heard far and wide — she replied</l>
     <l n="60">And she mocked in her voice sweet and merry , ‘ You man of the ferry ,</l>
     <l n="61">You man of — you man of the ferry ! ’</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="62">‘ Hie over ! ’ he shouted . The ferryman came at his calling ,</l>
     <l n="63">Across the clear reed-border 'd river he ferried us fast ;—</l>
     <l n="64">Such a chase ! Hand in hand , foot to foot , we ran on ; it surpass 'd</l>
     <l n="65">All measure her doubling — so close , then so far away falling ,</l>
     <l n="66">Then gone , and no more . Oh ! to see her but once unaware ,</l>
     <l n="67">And the mouth that had mocked , but we might not ( yet sure she was there ! ) ,</l>
     <l n="68">Nor behold her wild eyes and her mystical countenance fair .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="69">We sought in the wood , and we found the wood-wren in her stead ;</l>
     <l n="70">In the field , and we found but the cuckoo that talked overhead ;</l>
     <l n="71">By the brook , and we found the reed-sparrow deep-nested , in brown —</l>
     <l n="72">Not Echo , fair Echo ! for Echo , sweet Echo ! was flown .</l>
     <l n="73">So we came to the place where the dead people wait till God call .</l>
     <l n="74">The church was among them , grey moss over roof , over wall .</l>
     <l n="75">Very silent , so low . And we stood on a green grassy mound</l>
     <l n="76">And looked in at a window , for Echo , perhaps , in her round</l>
     <l n="77">Might have come in to hide there . But no ; every oak-carven seat</l>
     <l n="78">Was empty . We saw the great Bible — old , old , very old ,</l>
     <l n="79">And the parson 's great Prayer-book beside it ; we heard the slow beat</l>
     <l n="80">Of the pendulum swing in the tower ; we saw the clear gold</l>
     <l n="81">Of a sunbeam float down to the aisle and then waver and play</l>
     <l n="82">On the low chancel step and the railing , and Oliver said ,</l>
     <l n="83">‘ Look , Katie ! look , Katie ! when Lettice came here to be wed</l>
     <l n="84">She stood where that sunbeam drops down , and all white was her gown ;</l>
     <l n="85">And she stepped upon flowers they strew 'd for her . ’ Then quoth small Seven :</l>
     <l n="86">‘ Shall I wear a white gown and have flowers to walk upon ever ? ’</l>
     <l n="87">All doubtful : ‘ It takes a long time to grow up , ’ quoth Eleven ;</l>
     <l n="88">‘ You 're so little , you know , and the church is so old , it can never</l>
     <l n="89">Last on till you 're tall . ’ And in whispers — because it was old</l>
     <l n="90">And holy , and fraught with strange meaning , half felt , but not told ,</l>
     <l n="91">Full of old parsons ’ prayers , who were dead , of old days , of old folk ,</l>
     <l n="92">Neither heard nor beheld , but about us , in whispers we spoke .</l>
     <l n="93">Then we went from it softly and ran hand in hand to the strand ,</l>
     <l n="94">While bleating of flocks and birds ’ piping made sweeter the land .</l>
     <l n="95">And Echo came back e'en as Oliver drew to the ferry ,</l>
     <l n="96">‘ O Katie ! ’ ‘ O Katie ! ’ ‘ Come on , then ! ’ ‘ Come on , then ! ’ ‘ For , see ,</l>
     <l n="97">The round sun , all red , lying low by the tree ’ — ‘ by the tree . ’</l>
     <l n="98">‘ By the tree . ’ Ay , she mocked him again , with her voice sweet and merry :</l>
     <l n="99">‘ Hie over ! ’ ‘ Hie over ! ’ ‘ You man of the ferry ’ — ‘ the ferry . ’</l>
     <l n="100">‘ You man of the ferry —</l>
     <l n="101">You man of — you man of — the ferry . ’</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="102">Ay , here — it was here that we woke her , the Echo of old ;</l>
     <l n="103">All life of that day seems an echo , and many times told .</l>
     <l n="104">Shall I cross by the ferry to-morrow , and come in my white</l>
     <l n="105">To that little low church ? and will Oliver meet me anon ?</l>
     <l n="106">Will it all seem an echo from childhood pass 'd over — pass 'd on ?</l>
     <l n="107">Will the grave parson bless us ? Hark , hark ! in the dim failing light</l>
     <l n="108">I hear her ! As then the child 's voice clear and high , sweet and merry</l>
     <l n="109">Now she mocks the man 's tone with ‘ Hie over ! Hie over the ferry ! ’</l>
     <l n="110">‘ And , Katie . ’ ‘ And , Katie . ’ ‘ Art out with the glow-worms to-night ,</l>
     <l n="111">My Katie ? ’ ‘ My Katie ? ’ For gladness I break into laughter</l>
     <l n="112">And tears . Then it all comes again as from far-away years ;</l>
     <l n="113">Again , some one else — oh , how softly !— with laughter comes after ,</l>
     <l n="114">Comes after — with laughter comes after .</l>

     <l n="1">Only you 'd have me speak .</l>
     <l n="2">Whether to speak</l>
     <l n="3">Or whether to be silent is all one ;</l>
     <l n="4">Whether to sleep and in my dreaming front</l>
     <l n="5">Her small scared face forlorn ; whether to wake</l>
     <l n="6">And muse upon her small soft feet that paced</l>
     <l n="7">The hated , hard , inhospitable stone —</l>
     <l n="8">I say all 's one . But you would have me speak ,</l>
     <l n="9">And change one sorrow for the other . Ay ,</l>
     <l n="10">Right reverend father , comfortable father ,</l>
     <l n="11">Old , long in thrall , and wearied of the cell ,</l>
     <l n="12">So will I here — here staring through the grate ,</l>
     <l n="13">Whence , sheer beneath us lying the little town ,</l>
     <l n="14">Her street appears a riband up the rise ;</l>
     <l n="15">Where ‘ t is right steep for carts , behold two ruts</l>
     <l n="16">Worn in the flat , smooth , stone .</l>
     <l n="17">That side I stood ;</l>
     <l n="18">My head was down . At first I did but see</l>
     <l n="19">Her coming feet ; they gleamed through my hot tears</l>
     <l n="20">As she walked barefoot up yon short steep hill .</l>
     <l n="21">Then I dared all , gazed on her face , the maid</l>
     <l n="22">Martyr and utterly , utterly broke my heart .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="23">Her face , O ! it was wonderful to me ,</l>

     <l n="27">Her arms and head were bare , seemly she walked</l>
     <l n="28">All in her smock so modest as she might ;</l>

     <l n="30">For horrible adornment , flames of fire</l>

     <l n="32">Her eyes — she did not see me — opened wide ,</l>

     <l n="36">She was past that , soft , tender , hunted thing ;</l>
     <l n="37">But , as it seemed , confused from time to time ,</l>
     <l n="38">She would half-turn her or to left or right</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="40">Then their base pikes they basely thrust at her ,</l>

     <l n="43">That death was her near goal ; she was so lost ,</l>
     <l n="44">And set apart from any power to think .</l>
     <l n="45">But her mouth pouted as one brooding , father ,</l>
     <l n="46">Over a lifetime of forlorn fear . No ,</l>

     <l n="202">At those pent huddled doves they let not rest ;</l>
     <l n="203">No , it was almost envy . Ay , how sweet</l>
     <l n="204">The clash of bells ; they rang to boast that far</l>
     <l n="205">That cheerful street was from the cold sea-fog ,</l>
     <l n="206">From dark ploughed field and narrow lonesome lane .</l>
     <l n="207">How sweet to hear the hum of voices kind ,</l>
     <l n="208">To see the coach come up with din of horn .</l>
     <l n="209">Quick tramp of horses , mark the passers-by</l>
     <l n="210">Greet one another , and go on .</l>
     <l n="211">But now</l>
     <l n="212">They closed the shops , the wild clear voice was still ,</l>

     <l n="214">The coach which came from out dull darksome fells</l>
     <l n="215">Into the light ; passed to the dark again</l>
     <l n="216">Like some old comet which knows well her way ,</l>
     <l n="217">Whirled to the sun that as her fateful loop</l>
     <l n="218">She turns , forebodes the destined silences .</l>
     <l n="219">Yes , it was gone ; the clattering coach was gone ,</l>
     <l n="220">And those it bore I pitied even to tears ,</l>
     <l n="221">Because they must go forth , nor see the lights ,</l>
     <l n="222">Nor hear the chiming bells .</l>
     <l n="223">In after days ,</l>
     <l n="224">Remembering of the childish envy and</l>

     <l n="227">It may be are misplaced , or needed not .</l>

    <head>THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">There are who give themselves to work for men ,—</l>
     <l n="2">To raise the lost , to gather orphaned babes</l>
     <l n="3">And teach them , pitying of their mean estate ,</l>
     <l n="4">To feel for misery , and to look on crime</l>
     <l n="5">With ruth , till they forget that they themselves</l>
     <l n="6">Are of the race , themselves among the crowd</l>
     <l n="7">Under the sentence and outside the gate ,</l>
     <l n="8">And of the family and in the doom .</l>
     <l n="9">Cold is the world ; they feel how cold it is ,</l>
     <l n="10">And wish that they could warm it . Hard is life</l>
     <l n="11">For some . They would that they could soften it ;</l>
     <l n="12">And , in the doing of their work , they sigh</l>
     <l n="13">As if it was their choice and not their lot ;</l>
     <l n="14">And , in the raising of their prayer to God ,</l>
     <l n="15">They crave his kindness for the world he made ,</l>
     <l n="16">Till they , at last , forget that he , not they ,</l>
     <l n="17">Is the true lover of man .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="18">Now , in an ancient town , that had sunk low ,—</l>
     <l n="19">Trade having drifted from it , while there stayed</l>
     <l n="20">Too many , that it erst had fed , behind ,—</l>
     <l n="21">There walked a curate once , at early day .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="22">It was the summer-time ; but summer air</l>
     <l n="23">Came never , in its sweetness , down that dark</l>
     <l n="24">And crowded alley ,— never reached the door</l>
     <l n="25">Whereat he stopped ,— the sordid , shattered door .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="26">He paused , and , looking right and left , beheld</l>
     <l n="27">Dirt and decay , the lowering tenements</l>
     <l n="28">That leaned toward each other ; broken panes</l>
     <l n="29">Bulging with rags , and grim with old neglect ;</l>
     <l n="30">And reeking hills of formless refuse , heaped</l>
     <l n="31">To fade and fester in a stagnant air .</l>
     <l n="32">But he thought nothing of it : he had learned</l>
     <l n="33">To take all wretchedness for granted ,— he ,</l>
     <l n="34">Reared in a stainless home , and radiant yet</l>
     <l n="35">With the clear hues of healthful English youth ,</l>
     <l n="36">Had learned to kneel by beds forlorn , and stoop</l>
     <l n="37">Under foul lintels . He could touch , with hand</l>
     <l n="38">Unshrinking , fevered fingers ; he could hear</l>
     <l n="39">The language of the lost , in haunt and den ,—</l>
     <l n="40">So dismal , that the coldest passer-by</l>
     <l n="41">Must needs be sorry for them , and , albeit</l>
     <l n="42">They cursed , would dare to speak no harder words</l>
     <l n="43">Than these ,— “ God help them ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="44">Ay ! a learned man</l>
     <l n="45">The curate in all woes that plague mankind ,—</l>
     <l n="46">Too learned , for he was but young . His heart</l>
     <l n="47">Had yearned till it was overstrained , and now</l>
     <l n="48">He — plunged into a narrow slough unblest ,</l>
     <l n="49">Had struggled with its deadly waters , till</l>
     <l n="50">His own head had gone under , and he took</l>
     <l n="51">Small joy in work he could not look to aid</l>
     <l n="52">Its cleansing .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="53">Yet , by one right tender tie ,</l>
     <l n="54">Hope held him yet . The fathers coarse and dull ,</l>
     <l n="55">Vile mothers hard , and boys and girls profane ,</l>
     <l n="56">His soul drew back from . He had worked for them ,—</l>
     <l n="57">Work without joy : but , in his heart of hearts ,</l>
     <l n="58">He loved the little children ; and whene'er</l>
     <l n="59">He heard their prattle innocent , and heard</l>
     <l n="60">Their tender voices lisping sacred words</l>
     <l n="61">That he had taught them ,— in the cleanly calm</l>
     <l n="62">Of decent school , by decent matron held ,—</l>
     <l n="63">Then would he say , “ I shall have pleasure yet ,</l>
     <l n="64">In these . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="65">But now , when he pushed back that door</l>
     <l n="66">And mounted up a flight of ruined stairs ,</l>
     <l n="67">He said not that . He said , “ Oh ! once I thought</l>
     <l n="68">The little children would make bright for me</l>
     <l n="69">The crown they wear who have won many souls</l>
     <l n="70">For righteousness ; but oh , this evil place !</l>
     <l n="71">Hard lines it gives them , cold and dirt abhorred ,—</l>
     <l n="72">Hunger and nakedness , in lieu of love ,</l>
     <l n="73">And blows instead of care .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>“ And so they die , The little children that I love ,— they die ,— They turn their wistful faces to the wall , And slip away to God . ”</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">With that , his hand</l>
     <l n="2">He laid upon a latch and lifted it ,</l>
     <l n="3">Looked in full quietly , and entered straight .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="4">What saw he there ? He saw a three-years child ,</l>
     <l n="5">That lay a-dying on a wisp of straw</l>
     <l n="6">Swept up into a corner . O'er its brow</l>
     <l n="7">The damps of death were gathering : all alone ,</l>
     <l n="8">Uncared for , save that by its side was set</l>
     <l n="9">A cup , it waited . And the eyes had ceased</l>
     <l n="10">To look on things at hand . He thought they gazed</l>
     <l n="11">In wistful wonder , or some faint surmise</l>
     <l n="12">Of coming change ,— as though they saw the gate</l>
     <l n="13">Of that fair land that seems to most of us</l>
     <l n="14">Very far off .</l>
     <l n="15">When he beheld the look ,</l>
     <l n="16">He said , “ I knew , I knew how this would be !</l>
     <l n="17">Another ! Ay , and but for drunken blows</l>
     <l n="18">And dull forgetfulness of infant need ,</l>
     <l n="19">This little one had lived . ” And thereupon</l>
     <l n="20">The misery of it wrought upon him so ,</l>
     <l n="21">That , unaware , he wept . Oh ! then it was</l>
     <l n="22">That , in the bending of his manly head ,</l>
     <l n="23">It came between the child and that whereon</l>
     <l n="24">He gazed , and , when the curate glanced again ,</l>
     <l n="25">Those dying eyes , drawn back to earth once more ,</l>
     <l n="26">Looked up into his own , and smiled .</l>
     <l n="27">He drew</l>
     <l n="28">More near , and kneeled beside the small frail thing ,</l>
     <l n="29">Because the lips were moving ; and it raised</l>
     <l n="30">Its baby hand , and stroked away his tears ,</l>
     <l n="31">And whispered , “ Master ! master ! ” and so died .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="32">Now , in that town there was an ancient church ,</l>
     <l n="33">A minster of old days which these had turned</l>
     <l n="34">To parish uses : there the curate served .</l>
     <l n="35">It stood within a quiet swarded Close ,</l>
     <l n="36">Sunny and still , and , though it was not far</l>
     <l n="37">From those dark courts where poor humanity</l>
     <l n="38">Struggled and swarmed , it seemed to wear its own</l>
     <l n="39">Still atmosphere about it , and to hold</l>
     <l n="40">That old-world calm within its precincts pure</l>
     <l n="41">And that grave rest which modern life foregoes .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="42">When the sad curate , rising from his knees ,</l>
     <l n="43">Looked from the dead to heaven ,— as , unaware ,</l>
     <l n="44">Men do when they would track departed life ,— He</l>
     <l n="45">heard the deep tone of the minster-bell</l>
     <l n="46">Sounding for service , and he turned away</l>
     <l n="47">So heavy at heart , that , when he left behind</l>
     <l n="48">That dismal habitation , and came out</l>
     <l n="49">In the clear sunshine of the minster-yard ,</l>
     <l n="50">He never marked it . Up the aisle he moved ,</l>
     <l n="51">With his own gloom about him ; then came forth ,</l>
     <l n="52">And read before the folk grand words and calm ,— Words</l>
     <l n="53">full of hope ; but into his dull heart</l>
     <l n="54">Hope came not . As one talketh in a dream ,</l>
     <l n="55">And doth not mark the sense of his own words ,</l>
     <l n="56">He read ; and , as one walketh in a dream ,</l>
     <l n="57">He after walked toward the vestment-room ,</l>
     <l n="58">And never marked the way he went by ,— no ,</l>
     <l n="59">Nor the gray verger that before him stood ,</l>
     <l n="60">The great church-keys depending from his hand ,</l>
     <l n="61">Ready to follow him out and lock the door .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="62">At length , aroused to present things , but not</l>
     <l n="63">Content to break the sequence of his thought ,</l>
     <l n="64">Nor ready for the working day that held</l>
     <l n="65">Its busy course without , he said , “ Good friend ,</l>
     <l n="66">Leave me the keys : I would remain a while . ”</l>
     <l n="67">And , when the verger gave , he moved with him</l>
     <l n="68">Toward the door distraught , then shut him out ,</l>
     <l n="69">And locked himself within the church alone .</l>
     <l n="70">The minster-church was like a great brown cave ,</l>
     <l n="71">Fluted and fine with pillars , and all dim</l>
     <l n="72">With glorious gloom ; but , as the curate turned ,</l>
     <l n="73">Suddenly shone the sun ,— and roof and walls ,</l>
     <l n="74">Also the clustering shafts from end to end ,</l>
     <l n="75">Were thickly sown all over , as it were ,</l>
     <l n="76">With seedling rainbows . And it went and came</l>
     <l n="77">And went , that sunny beam , and drifted up</l>
     <l n="78">Ethereal bloom to flush the open wings</l>
     <l n="79">And carven cheeks of dimpled cherubim ,</l>
     <l n="80">And dropped upon the curate as he passed ,</l>
     <l n="81">And covered his white raiment and his hair .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="82">Then did look down upon him from their place ,</l>
     <l n="83">High in the upper lights , grave mitred priests ,</l>
     <l n="84">And grand old monarchs in their flowered gowns</l>
     <l n="85">And capes of miniver ; and therewithal</l>
     <l n="86">( A veiling cloud gone by ) the naked sun</l>
     <l n="87">Smote with his burning splendor all the pile ,</l>
     <l n="88">And in there rushed , through half-translucent panes ,</l>
     <l n="89">A sombre glory as of rusted gold ,</l>
     <l n="90">Deep ruby stains , and tender blue and green ,</l>
     <l n="91">That made the floor a beauty and delight ,</l>
     <l n="92">Strewed as with phantom blossoms , sweet enough</l>
     <l n="93">To have been wafted there the day they dropt</l>
     <l n="94">On the flower-beds in heaven .</l>
     <l n="95">The curate passed</l>
     <l n="96">Adown the long south aisle , and did not think</l>
     <l n="97">Upon this beauty , nor that he himself —</l>
     <l n="98">Excellent in the strength of youth , and fair</l>
     <l n="99">With all the majesty that noble work</l>
     <l n="100">And stainless manners give — did add his part</l>
     <l n="101">To make it fairer .</l>
     <l n="102">In among the knights</l>
     <l n="103">That lay with hands uplifted , by the lute</l>
     <l n="104">And palm of many a saint ,— ‘ neath capitals</l>
     <l n="105">Whereon our fathers had been bold to carve</l>
     <l n="106">With earthly tools their ancient childlike dream</l>
     <l n="107">Concerning heavenly fruit and living bowers ,</l>
     <l n="108">And glad full-throated birds that sing up there</l>
     <l n="109">Among the branches of the tree of life —</l>
     <l n="110">Through all the ordered forest of the shafts ,</l>
     <l n="111">Shooting on high to enter into light ,</l>
     <l n="112">That swam aloft ,— he took his silent way ,</l>
     <l n="113">And in the southern transept sat him down ,</l>
     <l n="114">Covered his face , and thought .</l>
     <l n="115">He said , “ No pain ,</l>

     <l n="183">And perfect in possession . So it spoke ,</l>

     <l n="187">The curate answered : “ Nay , I know thee well .</l>

     <l n="204">“ And was it long ? ”</l>
     <l n="205">The curate answered , pondering . “ Time being done ,</l>

     <l n="207">In our to-come , of infinite extension ? ”</l>
     <l n="208">Then said the child , “ In heaven we children talk</l>
     <l n="209">Of the great matters , and our lips are wise ;</l>
     <l n="210">But here I can but talk with thee in words</l>
     <l n="211">That here I knew . ” And therewithal , arisen ,</l>
     <l n="212">It said , “ I pray you take me in your arms . ”</l>
     <l n="213">Then , being afraid but willing , so he did ;</l>
     <l n="214">And partly drew about the radiant child ,</l>
     <l n="215">For better covering its dread purity ,</l>
     <l n="216">The foldings of his gown . And he beheld</l>
     <l n="217">Its beauty , and the tremulous woven light</l>
     <l n="218">That hung upon its hair ; withal , the robe ,</l>
     <l n="219">“ Whiter than fuller of this world can white , ”</l>
     <l n="220">That clothed its immortality . And so</l>
     <l n="221">The trembling came again , and he was dumb ,</l>
     <l n="222">Repenting his uncleanness : and he lift</l>
     <l n="223">His eyes , and all the holy place was full</l>
     <l n="224">Of living things ; and some were faint and dim ,</l>
     <l n="225">As if they bore an intermittent life ,</l>
     <l n="226">Waxing and waning ; and they had no form ,</l>
     <l n="227">But drifted on like slowly trailèd clouds ,</l>
     <l n="228">Or moving spots of darkness , with an eye</l>
     <l n="229">Apiece . And some , in guise of evil birds ,</l>
     <l n="230">Came by in troops , and stretched their naked necks ,</l>
     <l n="231">And some were men-like , but their heads hung down ;</l>
     <l n="232">And he said , “ O my God ! let me find grace</l>
     <l n="233">Not to behold their faces , for I know</l>
     <l n="234">They must be wicked and right terrible . ”</l>
     <l n="235">But while he prayed , lo ! whispers ; and there moved</l>
     <l n="236">Two shadows on the wall . He could not see</l>
     <l n="237">The forms of them that cast them : he could see</l>
     <l n="238">Only the shadows as of two that sat</l>
     <l n="239">Upon the floor , where , clad in women 's weeds ,</l>
     <l n="240">They lisped together . And he shuddered much :</l>
     <l n="241">There was a rustling near him , and he feared</l>

     <l n="351">Their tender crimson feet did pat the beam ,—</l>
     <l n="352">No phantoms they ; and soon the fellow-dove</l>

     <l n="358">Brother , this man that must , forsooth , be set</l>
     <l n="359">Such noble work , and suffered to behold</l>

     <l n="372">Nay , yet there live amongst us legions fair ,</l>
     <l n="373">Millions on millions , who could do right well</l>
     <l n="374">What he must fail in ; and ‘ twas whispered me ,</l>

     <l n="403">Withdrew his hand , and all their speech was done .</l>
     <l n="404">He moved toward them , but they fluttered forth</l>

     <l n="431">But the touch so wrought ,</l>
     <l n="432">That , lo ! the dazzled curate staggered back ,</l>

     <l n="435">Terrible lights , as pure long blades of fire .</l>
     <l n="436">“ Withdraw thy touch ! withdraw thy touch ! ” he cried ,</l>
     <l n="437">“ Or else shall I be blinded . ” Then the child</l>

    <head>THE MARINER 'S CAVE .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Once on a time there walked a mariner ,</l>
     <l n="2">That had been shipwrecked ;— on a lonely shore ,</l>
     <l n="3">And the green water made a restless stir ,</l>
     <l n="4">And a great flock of mews sped on before .</l>
     <l n="5">He had nor food nor shelter , for the tide</l>
     <l n="6">Rose on the one , and cliffs on the other side .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="7">Brown cliffs they were ; they seemed to pierce the sky ,</l>
     <l n="8">That was an awful deep of empty blue ,</l>
     <l n="9">Save that the wind was in it , and on high</l>
     <l n="10">A wavering skein of wild-fowl tracked it through .</l>
     <l n="11">He marked them not , but went with movement slow ,</l>
     <l n="12">Because his thoughts were sad , his courage low .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="13">His heart was numb , he neither wept nor sighed ,</l>
     <l n="14">But wearifully lingered by the wave ;</l>
     <l n="15">Until at length it chanced that he espied ,</l>
     <l n="16">Far up , an opening in the cliff , a cave ,</l>
     <l n="17">A shelter where to sleep in his distress ,</l>
     <l n="18">And lose his sorrow in forgetfulness .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="19">With that he clambered up the rugged face</l>
     <l n="20">Of that steep cliff that all in shadow lay ,</l>
     <l n="21">And , lo , there was a dry and homelike place ,</l>
     <l n="22">Comforting refuge for the castaway ;</l>
     <l n="23">And he laid down his weary , weary head ,</l>
     <l n="24">And took his fill of sleep till dawn waxed red .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="25">When he awoke , warm stirring from the south</l>
     <l n="26">Of delicate summer air did sough and flow ;</l>
     <l n="27">He rose , and , wending to the cavern 's mouth ,</l>
     <l n="28">He cast his eyes a little way below</l>
     <l n="29">Where on the narrow ledges , sharp and rude ,</l>
     <l n="30">Preening their wings the blue rock-pigeons cooed .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="31">Then he looked lower and saw the lavender</l>
     <l n="32">And sea-thrift blooming in long crevices ,</l>
     <l n="33">And the brown wallflower — April 's messenger ,</l>
     <l n="34">The wallflower marshalled in her companies .</l>
     <l n="35">Then lower yet he looked adown the steep ,</l>
     <l n="36">And sheer beneath him lapped the lovely deep .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="37">The laughing deep ;— and it was pacified</l>
     <l n="38">As if it had not raged that other day .</l>
     <l n="39">And it went murmuring in the morningtide</l>
     <l n="40">Innumerable flatteries on its way ,</l>
     <l n="41">Kissing the cliffs and whispering at their feet</l>
     <l n="42">With exquisite advancement , and retreat .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="43">This when the mariner beheld he sighed ,</l>

     <l n="46">On the fair reaches of their overthow ,</l>
     <l n="47">Thinking it strange he only lived of all ,</l>
     <l n="48">But not returning thanks , he heard a call !</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="49">A soft sweet call , a voice of tender ruth ,</l>
     <l n="50">He thought it came from out the cave . And , lo ,</l>
     <l n="51">It whispered , “ Man , look up ! ” But he , forsooth ,</l>
     <l n="52">Answered , “ I cannot , for the long waves flow</l>
     <l n="53">Across my gallant ship where sunk she lies</l>

     <l n="55">“ Moreover , I am heavy for the fate</l>

     <l n="58">Now they are gathered in their last long sleep .</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="61">And he stood yet watching the fair green sea</l>
     <l n="62">Till hunger reached him ; then he made a fire ,</l>
     <l n="63">A driftwood fire , and wandered listlessly</l>
     <l n="64">And gathered many eggs at his desire ,</l>
     <l n="65">And dressed them for his meal , and then he lay</l>
     <l n="66">And slept , and woke upon the second day .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="67">Whenas he said , “ The cave shall be my home ;</l>
     <l n="68">None will molest me , for the brown cliffs rise</l>
     <l n="69">Like castles of defence behind ,— the foam</l>
     <l n="70">Of the remorseless sea beneath me lies ;</l>
     <l n="71">‘ Tis easy from the cliff my food to win —</l>
     <l n="72">The nations of the rock-dove breed therein .</l>

     <l n="73">“ For fuel , at the ebb yon fair expanse</l>

     <l n="76">I will build up the entrance of the cave ,</l>
     <l n="77">And leave therein a window and a door ,</l>
     <l n="78">And here will dwell and leave it nevermore . ”</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="79">Then even so he did : and when his task ,</l>

     <l n="81">When he had eaten , as he sat to bask</l>
     <l n="82">In the red firelight glowing at his feet ,</l>
     <l n="83">He was right glad of shelter , and he said ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="85">Then did the voice awake and speak again ;</l>

     <l n="89">Because they warm me . ” Then the voice was still ,</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="91">And soon it came to pass that he got gain .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="97">He took a wife , and brought her home to him ;</l>

     <l n="100">Gloom came no more ; and she would minister</l>
     <l n="101">To all his wants ; while he , being well content ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="103">But once as on the lintel of the door</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="19">
     <l n="109">And then the soft voice of the cave awoke —</l>

     <l n="112">“ Woman , look up ! ” But she , with tender guile ,</l>

     <l n="1">Niloiya said to Noah , “ What aileth thee ,</l>
     <l n="2">My master , unto whom is my desire ,</l>
     <l n="3">The father of my sons ? ” He answered her ,</l>
     <l n="4">“ Mother of many children , I have heard</l>
     <l n="5">The Voice again . ” “ Ah , me ! ” she saith , “ ah , me !</l>
     <l n="6">What spake it ? ” and with that Niloiya sighed .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="7">This when the Master-builder heard , his heart</l>
     <l n="8">Was sad in him , the while he sat at home</l>
     <l n="9">And rested after toil . The steady rap</l>
     <l n="10">O ’ the shipwright 's hammer sounding up the vale</l>
     <l n="11">Did seem to mock him ; but her distaff down</l>
     <l n="12">Niloiya laid , and to the doorplace went ,</l>
     <l n="13">Parted the purple covering seemly hung</l>
     <l n="14">Before it , and let in the crimson light</l>
     <l n="15">Of the descending sun . Then looked he forth ,—</l>
     <l n="16">Looked , and beheld the hollow where the ark</l>
     <l n="17">Was a-preparing ; where the dew distilled</l>
     <l n="18">All night from leaves of old lign aloe-trees ,</l>
     <l n="19">Upon the gliding river ; where the palm ,</l>
     <l n="20">The almug , and the gophir shot their heads</l>
     <l n="21">Into the crimson brede that dyed the world :</l>
     <l n="22">And lo ! he marked — unwieldy , dark , and huge — The</l>
     <l n="23">ship , his glory and his grief ,— too vast</l>
     <l n="24">For that still river 's floating ,— building far</l>
     <l n="25">From mightier streams , amid the pastoral dells</l>
     <l n="26">Of shepherd kings .</l>

     <l n="27">Niloiya spake again :</l>
     <l n="28">“ What said the Voice , thou well-beloved man ? ”</l>
     <l n="29">He , laboring with his thought that troubled him ,</l>
     <l n="30">Spoke on behalf of God : “ Behold , ” said he ,</l>
     <l n="31">“ A little handful of unlovely dust</l>
     <l n="32">He fashioned to a lordly grace , and when</l>
     <l n="33">He laughed upon its beauty , it waxed warm ,</l>
     <l n="34">And with His breath awoke a living soul .</l>

     <l n="38">‘ Lord , God , I love the woman and her sons ,— I</l>

     <l n="41">She answered him , “ Tell on . ”</l>
     <l n="42">And he continuing , reasoned with his soul :</l>
     <l n="43">“ What though I ,— like some goodly lama sunk</l>
     <l n="44">In meadow grass , eating her way at ease ,</l>
     <l n="45">Unseen of them that pass , and asking not</l>
     <l n="46">A wider prospect than of yellow-flowers</l>
     <l n="47">That nod above her head ,— should lay me down ,</l>
     <l n="48">And willingly forget this high behest ,</l>
     <l n="49">There should be yet no tarrying . Furthermore ,</l>
     <l n="50">Though I went forth to cry against the doom ,</l>
     <l n="51">Earth crieth louder , and she draws it down :</l>
     <l n="52">It hangeth balanced over us ; she crieth ,</l>
     <l n="53">And it shall fall . O ! as for me , my life</l>
     <l n="54">Is bitter , looking onward , for I know</l>
     <l n="55">That in the fulness of the time shall dawn</l>
     <l n="56">That day : my preaching shall not bring forth fruit ,</l>
     <l n="57">Though for its sake I leave thee . I shall float</l>
     <l n="58">Upon the abhorréd sea , that mankind hate ,</l>
     <l n="59">With thee and thine . ”</l>
     <l n="60">She answered : “ God forbid !</l>
     <l n="61">For , sir , though men be evil , yet the deep</l>

     <l n="63">To Him , and He long-suffering will forgive .</l>
     <l n="64">And chide the waters back to their abyss ,</l>

     <l n="103">To let no drop of sunshine through , and hung</l>
     <l n="104">With gold and purple fruitage , and the white</l>
     <l n="105">Thick cups of scented blossom . Underneath ,</l>
     <l n="106">Soft grew the sward and delicate , and flocks</l>
     <l n="107">Of egrets , ay , and many cranes , stood up .</l>
     <l n="108">Fanning their wings , to agitate and cool</l>
     <l n="109">The noonday air , as men with heed and pains</l>
     <l n="110">Had taught them , marshalling and taming them</l>
     <l n="111">To bear the wind in , on their moving wings .</l>
     <l n="112">So long time as a nimble slave would spend</l>
     <l n="113">In milking of her cow , they walked at ease ;</l>
     <l n="114">Then reached the palace , all of forest trunks ,</l>
     <l n="115">Brought whole , and set together , made . Therein</l>
     <l n="116">Had dwelt old Adam , when his mighty sons</l>
     <l n="117">Had finished it , and up to Eden gate</l>
     <l n="118">Had journeyed for to fetch him . “ Here , ” they said</l>
     <l n="119">“ Mother and father , ye may dwell , and here</l>
     <l n="120">Forget the garden wholly . ”</l>
     <l n="121">So he came</l>
     <l n="122">Under the doorplace , and the women sat ,</l>
     <l n="123">Each with her finger on her lips ; but he ,</l>
     <l n="124">Having been called , went on , until he reached</l>
     <l n="125">The jewelled settle , wrought with cunning work</l>
     <l n="126">Of gold and ivory , whereon they wont</l>
     <l n="127">To set the Elder . All with sleekest skins ,</l>
     <l n="128">That striped and spotted creatures of the wood</l>
     <l n="129">Had worn , the seat was covered , but thereon</l>
     <l n="130">The Elder was not ; by the steps thereof ,</l>
     <l n="131">Upon the floor , whereto his silver beard</l>
     <l n="132">Did reach , he sat , and he was in his trance .</l>
     <l n="133">Upon the settle many doves were perched ,</l>
     <l n="134">That set the air a going with their wings :</l>
     <l n="135">These opposite , the world 's great shipwright stood</l>
     <l n="136">To wait the burden ; and the Elder spake :</l>
     <l n="137">“ Will He forget me ? Would He might forget !</l>
     <l n="138">Old , old ! The hope of old Methuselah</l>
     <l n="139">Is all in His forgetfulness . ” With that ,</l>
     <l n="140">A slave-girl took a cup of wine , and crept</l>
     <l n="141">Anear him , saying , “ Taste ” ; and when his lips</l>
     <l n="142">Had touched it , lo , he trembled , and he cried ,</l>
     <l n="143">“ Behold , I prophesy . ”</l>
     <l n="144">Then straight they fled</l>
     <l n="145">That were about him , and did stand apart</l>
     <l n="146">And stop their ears . For he , from time to time ,</l>
     <l n="147">Was plagued with that same fate to prophesy ,</l>
     <l n="148">And spake against himself , against his day</l>
     <l n="149">And time , in words that all men did abhor .</l>
     <l n="150">Therefore , he warning them what time the fit</l>
     <l n="151">Came on him , saved them , that they heard it not</l>
     <l n="152">So while they fled , he cried : “ I saw the God</l>
     <l n="153">Reach out of heaven His wonderful right hand .</l>
     <l n="154">Lo , lo ! He dipped it in the unquiet sea ,</l>
     <l n="155">And in its curved palm behold the ark ,</l>
     <l n="156">As in a vast calm lake , came floating on .</l>
     <l n="157">Ay , then , His other hand — the cursing hand —</l>
     <l n="158">He took and spread between us and the sun .</l>
     <l n="159">And all was black ; the day was blotted out ,</l>
     <l n="160">And horrible staggering took the frighted earth .</l>
     <l n="161">I heard the water hiss , and then methinks</l>
     <l n="162">The crack as of her splitting . Did she take</l>
     <l n="163">Their palaces that are my brothers dear ,</l>
     <l n="164">And huddle them with all their ancientry</l>
     <l n="165">Under into her breast ? If it was black ,</l>
     <l n="166">How could this old man see ? There was a noise</l>
     <l n="167">I ’ the dark , and He drew back His hand again .</l>
     <l n="168">I looked ,— It was a dream ,— let no man say</l>
     <l n="169">It was aught else . There , so — the fit goes by .</l>
     <l n="170">Sir , and my daughters , is it eventide ?—</l>
     <l n="171">Sooner than that , saith old Methuselah ,</l>
     <l n="172">Let the vulture lay his beak to my green limbs .</l>
     <l n="173">What ! art Thou envious ?— are the sons of men</l>
     <l n="174">Too wise to please Thee , and to do Thy will ?</l>
     <l n="175">Methuselah , he sitteth on the ground ,</l>
     <l n="176">Clad in his gown of age , the pale white gown ,</l>
     <l n="177">And goeth not forth to war ; his wrinkled hands</l>
     <l n="178">He claspeth round his knees : old , very old .</l>
     <l n="179">Would he could steal from Thee one secret more —</l>
     <l n="180">The secret of Thy youth ! O , envious God !</l>
     <l n="181">We die . The words of old Methuselah</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="183">Then the wives ,</l>
     <l n="184">Beholding how he trembled , and the maids</l>
     <l n="185">And children , came anear , saying , “ Who art thou</l>
     <l n="186">That standest gazing on the Elder ? Lo ,</l>

     <l n="190">To look upon them , and their majesty</l>
     <l n="191">And glorious beauty took away his words ;</l>
     <l n="192">And being pure among the vile , he cast</l>
     <l n="193">In his thought a veil of snow-white purity</l>
     <l n="194">Over the beauteous throng . “ Thou dost not well , ”</l>
     <l n="195">They said . He answered : “ Blossoms o ’ the world ,</l>

     <l n="202">With climbing roses , drops in white and red ,—</l>
     <l n="203">Saw I ( good angels keep you in their care )</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="205">With that , they stamped ,</l>
     <l n="206">Gnashed their white teeth , and turning , fled and spat</l>
     <l n="207">Upon the floor . The Elder spake to him ,</l>
     <l n="208">Yet shaking with the burden , “ Who art thou ? ”</l>
     <l n="209">He answered , “ I , the man whom thou didst send</l>

     <l n="212">No , nor mine errand . To thy house I spake ,</l>
     <l n="213">Touching their beauty . ” “ Wherefore didst thou spite , ”</l>
     <l n="214">Quoth he , “ the daughters ? ” and it seemed he lost</l>
     <l n="215">Count of that prophecy , for very age ,</l>
     <l n="216">And from his thin lips dropt a trembling laugh .</l>
     <l n="217">“ Wicked old man , ” quoth he , “ this wise old man</l>

     <l n="221">To rid the world of His white soldiers . Ay ,</l>
     <l n="222">Scenting of human sacrifice , they fled .</l>
     <l n="223">Cowards ! I heard them winnow their great wings :</l>
     <l n="224">They went to tell Him ; but they came no more .</l>
     <l n="225">The women hate to hear of them , so sore</l>

    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>With that he fell to weeping . “ Son , ” said he , “ Long have I hid mine eyes from stalwart men , For it is hard to lose the majesty And pride and power of manhood : but to-day , Stand forth into the light , that I may look Upon thy strength , and think , EVEN THUS DID I , IN THE GLORY OF MY YOUTH , MORE LIKE TO GOD THAN LIKE HIS SOLDIERS , FACE THE VASSAL WORLD . ”</p>

     <l n="1">Above the head of great Methuselah</l>
     <l n="2">There lay two demons in the opened roof</l>
     <l n="3">Invisible , and gathered up his words ;</l>
     <l n="4">For when the Elder prophesied , it came</l>
     <l n="5">About , that hidden things were shown to them ,</l>
     <l n="6">And burdens that he spake against his time .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="7">( But never heard them , such as dwelt with him ;</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="11">Now these were fettered that they could not fly ,</l>

     <l n="13">Against the ruler of their host ; but not</l>
     <l n="14">The less they loved their cause ; and when the feet</l>
     <l n="15">O ’ the Master-builder were no longer heard ,</l>
     <l n="16">They , slipping to the sward , right painfully</l>
     <l n="17">Did follow , for the one to the other said ,</l>
     <l n="18">“ Behoves our master know of this ; and us ,</l>

     <l n="21">And thus it came to pass ,</l>
     <l n="22">That while at dead of night the old dragon lay</l>
     <l n="23">Coiled in the cavern where he dwelt , the watch</l>
     <l n="24">Pacing before it saw in middle air</l>
     <l n="25">A boat , that gleamed like fire , and on it came ,</l>
     <l n="26">And rocked as it drew near , and then it burst</l>
     <l n="27">And went to pieces , and there fell therefrom ,</l>
     <l n="28">Close at the cavern 's mouth , two glowing balls .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="29">Now there was drawn a curtain nigh the mouth</l>

     <l n="31">The dragon had been wroth with some that served ,</l>
     <l n="32">And chased them from him ; and his oracles ,</l>
     <l n="33">That wont to drop from him , were stopped , and men</l>
     <l n="34">Might only pray to him through that fell web</l>
     <l n="35">That hung before him . Then did whisper low</l>
     <l n="36">Some of the little spirits that bat-like clung</l>
     <l n="37">And clustered round the opening . “ Lo , ” they said ,</l>
     <l n="38">While gazed the watch upon those glowing balls ,</l>
     <l n="39">“ These are like moons eclipsed ; but let them lie</l>
     <l n="40">Red on the moss , and sear its dewy spires ,</l>
     <l n="41">Until our lord give leave to draw the web ,</l>
     <l n="42">And quicken reverence by his presence dread ,</l>

     <l n="44">And they will change . At present he is sick ,</l>
     <l n="45">And wills that none disturb him . ” So they lay ,</l>
     <l n="46">And there was silence , for the forest tribes</l>

     <l n="1">Now while these evil ones took counsel strange ,</l>
     <l n="2">The son of Lamech journeyed home ; and , lo !</l>
     <l n="3">A company came down , and struck the track</l>
     <l n="4">As he did enter it . There rode in front</l>
     <l n="5">Two horsemen , young and noble , and behind</l>
     <l n="6">Were following slaves with tent gear ; others led</l>
     <l n="7">Strong horses , others bare the instruments</l>
     <l n="8">O ’ the chase , and in the rear dull camels lagged ,</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="11">And as they met , those horsemen drew the rein ,</l>
     <l n="12">And fixed on him their grave untroubled eyes ;</l>
     <l n="13">He in his regal grandeur walked alone ,</l>
     <l n="14">And had nor steed nor follower , and his mien</l>
     <l n="15">Was grave and like to theirs . He said to them ,</l>
     <l n="16">“ Fair sirs , whose are ye ? ” They made answer cold ,</l>
     <l n="17">“ The beautiful woman , sir , our mother dear ,</l>

     <l n="24">Which while they spoke had halted , moved apace ,</l>
     <l n="25">And , while the silent father stood , went by ,</l>
     <l n="26">He gazing after , as a man that dreams ;</l>
     <l n="27">For he was sick with their cold , quiet scorn ,</l>
     <l n="28">That seemed to say , “ Father , we own you not .</l>
     <l n="29">We love you not , for you have left us long ,—</l>

     <l n="37">The young men , even our masters , bathed ; ( there grows</l>

     <l n="46">Standing as motionless as pillar set</l>
     <l n="47">To guide a wanderer in a pathless waste ;</l>
     <l n="48">But all his strength went from him , and he strove</l>
     <l n="49">Vainly to trample out and trample down</l>
     <l n="50">The misery of his love unsatisfied ,—</l>
     <l n="51">Unutterable love flung in his face .</l>

     <l n="57">And when from his own lips he heard those words ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="59">And none came nigh to comfort him . His face</l>

     <l n="62">The river ; and in hollow of his hand</l>
     <l n="63">Raised up the water to his brow : “ This son ,</l>
     <l n="64">This other son of mine , ” he said , “ shall see</l>
     <l n="65">No tears upon my face . ” And he looked on ,</l>
     <l n="66">Beheld the camels , and a group of slaves</l>
     <l n="67">Sitting apart from some one fast asleep ,</l>
     <l n="68">Where they had spread out webs of broidery work</l>
     <l n="69">Under a cedar-tree ; and he came on ,</l>
     <l n="70">And when they made obeisance he declared</l>
     <l n="71">His name , and said , “ I will beside my son</l>
     <l n="72">Sit till he wakeneth . ” So Japhet lay</l>
     <l n="73">A-dreaming , and his father drew to him .</l>
     <l n="74">He said , “ This cannot scorn me yet ” ; and paused ,</l>
     <l n="75">Right angry with himself , because the youth ,</l>
     <l n="76">Albeit of stately growth , so languidly</l>
     <l n="77">Lay with a listless smile upon his mouth ,</l>
     <l n="78">That was full sweet and pure ; and as he looked ,</l>
     <l n="79">He half forgot his trouble in his pride .</l>
     <l n="80">“ And is this mine ? ” said he , “ my son ! mine own !</l>
     <l n="81">( God , thou art good ! ) O , if this turn away ,</l>
     <l n="82">That pang shall be past bearing . I must think</l>

     <l n="91">And when he ceased , the youth , with sleep content ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="93">He woke , and opened on his father 's face</l>

     <l n="96">He was not ready , for he feared to see</l>
     <l n="97">This mouth curl up with scorn . And Japhet spoke ,</l>
     <l n="98">Full of the calm that cometh after sleep :</l>
     <l n="99">“ Sir , I have dreamed of you . I pray you , sir ,</l>
     <l n="100">What is your name ? ” and even with his words</l>
     <l n="101">His countenance changed . The son of Lamech said ,</l>
     <l n="102">“ Why art thou sad ? What have I done to thee ? ”</l>
     <l n="103">And Japhet answered , “ O , methought I fled</l>
     <l n="104">In the wilderness before a maddened beast ,</l>
     <l n="105">And you came up and slew it ; and I thought</l>
     <l n="106">You were my father ; but I fear me , sir ,</l>
     <l n="107">My thoughts were vain . ” With that his father said ,</l>
     <l n="108">“ Whatever of blessing Thou reserv'st for me ,</l>
     <l n="109">God ! if Thou wilt not give to both , give here :</l>
     <l n="110">Bless him with both Thy hands ” ; and laid his own</l>
     <l n="111">On Japhet 's head .</l>
     <l n="112">Then Japhet looked on him ,</l>
     <l n="113">Made quiet by content , and answered low ,</l>
     <l n="114">With faltering laughter , glad and reverent : “ Sir ,</l>
     <l n="115">You are my father ? ” “ Ay , ” quoth he , “ I am !</l>
     <l n="116">Kiss me , my son ; and let me hear my name ,</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="118">Then after , rested , they betook them home :</l>
     <l n="119">And Japhet , walking by the Master , thought ,</l>
     <l n="120">“ I did not will to love this sire of mine ;</l>

     <l n="123">But I would rather serve him than go free</l>
     <l n="124">With my two brethren . ” And he said to him ,</l>
     <l n="125">“ Father ! ” — who answered , “ I am here , my son . ”</l>
     <l n="126">And Japhet said , “ I pray you , sir , attend</l>

     <l n="133">I pray you , sir , when you go forth again ,</l>
     <l n="134">That I may also go . ” And he replied ,</l>
     <l n="135">“ I will tell thy speech unto the Highest ; He</l>

     <l n="147">Corn for sustaining of my wife , and bruise</l>
     <l n="148">The fruit of the vine to cheer her . ” But he said ,</l>
     <l n="149">“ Dost thou forget ? or dost thou not believe ,</l>
     <l n="150">My son ? ” He answered , “ I did ne'er believe ,</l>
     <l n="151">My father , ere to-day ; but now , methinks ,</l>
     <l n="152">Whatever thou believest I believe ,</l>
     <l n="153">For thy belovéd sake . If this then be</l>
     <l n="154">As thou ( I hear ) hast said , and earth doth bear</l>
     <l n="155">The last of her wheat harvests , and make ripe</l>
     <l n="156">The latest of her grapes ; yet hear me , sir ,</l>
     <l n="157">None of the daughters shall be given to me</l>
     <l n="158">If I be landless . ” Then his father said ,</l>
     <l n="159">“ Lift up thine eyes toward the north , my son ”</l>
     <l n="160">And so he did . “ Behold thy heritage ! ”</l>
     <l n="161">Quoth the world 's prince and master , “ far away</l>

     <l n="1">And when two days were over , Japhet said ,</l>
     <l n="2">“ Mother , so please you , get a wife for me . ”</l>
     <l n="3">The mother answered , “ Dost thou mock me , son ?</l>
     <l n="4">‘ Tis not the manner of our kin to wed</l>
     <l n="5">So young . Thou knowest it ; art thou not ashamed ?</l>
     <l n="6">Thou carest not for a wife . ” And the youth blushed ,</l>
     <l n="7">And made for answer : “ This , my father , saith</l>
     <l n="8">The doom is nigh ; now therefore find a maid ,</l>
     <l n="9">Or else shall I be wifeless all my days .</l>
     <l n="10">And as for me , I care not ; but the lands</l>
     <l n="11">Are parted , and the goodliest share is mine .</l>
     <l n="12">And lo ! my brethren are betrothed ; their maids</l>
     <l n="13">Are with thee in the house . Then why not mine ?</l>
     <l n="14">Didst thou not diligently search for these</l>
     <l n="15">Among the noblest born of all the earth ,</l>
     <l n="16">And bring them up ? My sisters , dwell they not</l>
     <l n="17">With women that bespake them for their sons ?</l>
     <l n="18">Now , therefore , let a wife be found for me ,</l>
     <l n="19">Fair as the day , and gentle to my will</l>
     <l n="20">As thou art to my father 's . ” When she heard ,</l>
     <l n="21">Niloiya sighed , and answered , “ It is well . ”</l>
     <l n="22">And Japhet went out from her presence .</l>
     <l n="23">Then</l>
     <l n="24">Quoth the great Master : “ Wherefore sought ye not ,</l>
     <l n="25">Woman , these many days , nor tired at all ,</l>
     <l n="26">Till ye had found , a maiden for my son ?</l>
     <l n="27">In this ye have done ill . ” Niloiya said :</l>
     <l n="28">“ Let not my lord be angry . All my soul</l>
     <l n="29">Is sad : my lord hath walked afar so long ,</l>
     <l n="30">That some despise thee ; yea , our servants fail</l>
     <l n="31">Lately to bring their stint of corn and wood .</l>
     <l n="32">And , sir , thy household slaves do steal away</l>
     <l n="33">To thy great father , and our lands lie waste ,—</l>
     <l n="34">None till them : therefore think the women scorn</l>
     <l n="35">To give me ,— whatsoever gems I send ,</l>
     <l n="36">And goodly raiment ,— ( yea , I seek afar ,</l>
     <l n="37">And sue with all desire and humbleness</l>
     <l n="38">Through every master 's house , but no one gives ) —</l>
     <l n="39">A daughter for my son . ” With that she ceased .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="40">Then said the Master : “ Some thou hast with thee ,</l>
     <l n="41">Brought up among thy children , dutiful</l>
     <l n="42">And fair ; thy father gave them for my slaves ,—</l>
     <l n="43">Children of them whom he brought captive forth</l>
     <l n="44">From their own heritage . ” And she replied ,</l>
     <l n="45">Right scornfully : “ Shall Japhet wed a slave ? ”</l>
     <l n="46">Then said the Master : “ He shall wed : look thou</l>
     <l n="47">To that . I say not he shall wed a slave ;</l>
     <l n="48">But by the might of One that made him mine ,</l>
     <l n="49">I will not quit thee for my doomed way</l>
     <l n="50">Until thou wilt betroth him . Therefore , haste ,</l>
     <l n="51">Beautiful woman , loved of me and mine ,</l>
     <l n="52">To bring a maiden , and to say , ‘ Behold</l>
     <l n="53">A wife for Japhet . ’ ” Then she answered , “ Sir ,</l>
     <l n="54">It shall be done . ”</l>
     <l n="55">And forth Niloiya sped .</l>
     <l n="56">She gathered all her jewels ,— all she held</l>
     <l n="57">Of costly or of rich ,— and went and spake</l>
     <l n="58">With some few slaves that yet abode with her ,</l>
     <l n="59">For daily they were fewer ; and went forth ,</l>
     <l n="60">With fair and flattering words , among her feres ,</l>
     <l n="61">And fain had wrought with them : and she had hope</l>
     <l n="62">That made her sick , it was so faint ; and then</l>
     <l n="63">She had fear , and after she had certainty ,</l>
     <l n="64">For all did scorn her . “ Nay , ” they cried . “ O fool !</l>
     <l n="65">If this be so , and on a watery world</l>
     <l n="66">Ye think to rock , what matters if a wife</l>
     <l n="67">Be free or bond ? There shall be none to rule ,</l>
     <l n="68">If she have freedom : if she have it not ,</l>
     <l n="69">None shall there be to serve . ”</l>
     <l n="70">And she alit ,</l>
     <l n="71">The time being done , desponding at her door ,</l>
     <l n="72">And went behind a screen , where should have wrought</l>
     <l n="73">The daughters of the captives ; but there wrought</l>
     <l n="74">One only , and this rose from off the floor ,</l>
     <l n="75">Where she the river rush full deftly wove ,</l>
     <l n="76">And made obeisance . Then Niloiya said ,</l>
     <l n="77">“ Where are thy fellows ? ” And the maid replied ,</l>
     <l n="78">“ Let not Niloiya , this my lady loved ,</l>
     <l n="79">Be angry ; they are fled since yesternight . ”</l>
     <l n="80">Then said Niloiya , “ Amarant , my slave ,</l>
     <l n="81">When have I called thee by thy name before ? ”</l>
     <l n="82">She answered , “ Lady , never ” ; and she took</l>
     <l n="83">And spread her broidered robe before her face .</l>
     <l n="84">Niloiya spoke thus : “ I am come to woe ,</l>
     <l n="85">And thou to honor . ” Saying this , she wept</l>
     <l n="86">Passionate tears ; and all the damsel 's soul</l>
     <l n="87">Was full of yearning wonder , and her robe</l>
     <l n="88">Slipped from her hand , and her right innocent face</l>
     <l n="89">Was seen betwixt her locks of tawny hair</l>
     <l n="90">That dropped about her knees , and her two eyes ,</l>
     <l n="91">Blue as the much-loved flower that rims the beck ,</l>
     <l n="92">Looked sweetly on Niloiya ; but she knew</l>
     <l n="93">No meaning in her words ; and she drew nigh ,</l>
     <l n="94">And kneeled and said , “ Will this my lady speak ?</l>
     <l n="95">Her damsel is desirous of her words . ”</l>
     <l n="96">Then said Niloiya , “ I , thy mistress , sought</l>
     <l n="97">A wife for Japhet , and no wife is found . ”</l>
     <l n="98">And yet again she wept with grief of heart ,</l>
     <l n="99">Saying , “ Ah me , miserable ! I must give</l>
     <l n="100">A wife : the Master willeth it : a wife ,</l>
     <l n="101">Ah me ! unto the high-born . He will scorn</l>
     <l n="102">His mother and reproach me . I must give —</l>
     <l n="103">None else have I to give — a slave ,— even thee . ”</l>
     <l n="104">This further spake Niloiya : “ I was good ,—</l>
     <l n="105">Had rue on thee , a tender sucking child ,</l>
     <l n="106">When they did tear thee from thy mother 's breast ;</l>
     <l n="107">I fed thee , gave thee shelter , and I taught</l>
     <l n="108">Thy hands all cunning arts that women prize .</l>
     <l n="109">But out on me ! my good is turned to ill .</l>
     <l n="110">O , Japhet , well-beloved ! ” And she rose up ,</l>
     <l n="111">And did restrain herself , saying , “ Dost thou heed ?</l>
     <l n="112">Behold , this thing shall be . ” The damsel sighed ,</l>
     <l n="113">“ Lady , I do . ” Then went Niloiya forth .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="114">And Amarant murmured in her deep amaze ,</l>
     <l n="115">“ Shall Japhet 's little children kiss my mouth ?</l>
     <l n="116">And will he sometimes take them from my arms ,</l>
     <l n="117">And almost care for me for their sweet sake ?</l>
     <l n="118">I have not dared to think I loved him ,— now</l>
     <l n="119">I know it well : but O , the bitterness</l>
     <l n="120">For him ! ” And ending thus , the damsel rose ,</l>
     <l n="121">For Japhet entered . And she bowed herself</l>
     <l n="122">Meekly and made obeisance , but her blood</l>
     <l n="123">Ran cold about her heart , for all his face</l>
     <l n="124">Was colored with his passion .</l>
     <l n="125">Japhet spoke :</l>
     <l n="126">He said , “ My father 's slave ” ; and she replied ,</l>
     <l n="127">Low drooping her fair head , “ My master 's son . ”</l>
     <l n="128">And after that a silence fell on them ,</l>
     <l n="129">With trembling at her heart , and rage at his .</l>
     <l n="130">And Japhet , mastered of his passion , sat</l>
     <l n="131">And could not speak . O ! cruel seemed his fate ,—</l>
     <l n="132">So cruel her that told it , so unkind .</l>
     <l n="133">His breast was full of wounded love and wrath</l>
     <l n="134">Wrestling together ; and his eyes flashed out</l>
     <l n="135">Indignant lights , as all amazed he took</l>
     <l n="136">The insult home that she had offered him ,</l>
     <l n="137">Who should have held his honor dear .</l>
     <l n="138">And , lo ,</l>
     <l n="139">The misery choked him and he cried in pain ,</l>
     <l n="140">“ Go , get thee forth ” ; but she , all white and still ,</l>
     <l n="141">Parted her lips to speak , and yet spake not ,</l>
     <l n="142">Nor moved . And Japhet rose up passionate ,</l>
     <l n="143">With lifted arm as one about to strike ;</l>
     <l n="144">But she cried out and met him , and she held</l>
     <l n="145">With desperate might his hand , and prayed to him ,</l>
     <l n="146">“ Strike not , or else shall men from henceforth say ,</l>
     <l n="147">‘ Japhet is like to us . ’ ” And he shook off</l>
     <l n="148">The damsel , and he said , “ I thank thee , slave ;</l>
     <l n="149">For never have I stricken yet or child</l>
     <l n="150">Or woman . Not for thy sake am I glad ,</l>
     <l n="151">Nay , but for mine . Get hence . Obey my words . ”</l>
     <l n="152">Then Japhet lifted up his voice , and wept .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="153">And no more he restrained himself , but cried ,</l>
     <l n="154">With heavings of the heart , “ O hateful day !</l>
     <l n="155">O day that shuts the door upon delight .</l>
     <l n="156">A slave ! to wed a slave ! O loathéd wife ,</l>
     <l n="157">Hated of Japhet 's soul . ” And after , long ,</l>
     <l n="158">With face between his hands , he sat , his thoughts</l>
     <l n="159">Sullen and sore ; then scorned himself , and saying ,</l>
     <l n="160">“ I will not take her , I will die unwed ,</l>
     <l n="161">It is but that ” ; lift up his eyes and saw</l>
     <l n="162">The slave , and she was sitting at his feet ;</l>
     <l n="163">And he , so greatly wondering that she dared</l>
     <l n="164">The disobedience , looked her in the face</l>
     <l n="165">Less angry than afraid , for pale she was</l>
     <l n="166">As lily yet unsmiled on by the sun ;</l>
     <l n="167">And he , his passion being spent , sighed out ,</l>
     <l n="168">“ Low am I fallen indeed . Hast thou no fear ,</l>
     <l n="169">That thou dost flout me ? ” but she gave to him</l>
     <l n="170">The sighing echo of his sigh , and mourned ,</l>
     <l n="171">“ No . ”</l>
     <l n="172">And he wondered , and he looked again ,</l>
     <l n="173">For in her heart there was a new-born pang ,</l>
     <l n="174">That cried ; but she , as mothers with their young ,</l>
     <l n="175">Suffered , yet loved it ; and there shone a strange</l>
     <l n="176">Grave sweetness in her blue unsullied eyes .</l>
     <l n="177">And Japhet , leaning from the settle , thought ,</l>
     <l n="178">“ What is it ? I will call her by her name ,</l>
     <l n="179">To comfort her , for also she is naught</l>
     <l n="180">To blame ; and since I will not her to wife ,</l>
     <l n="181">She falls back from the freedom she had hoped . ”</l>
     <l n="182">Then he said “ Amarant ” ; and the damsel drew</l>
     <l n="183">Her eyes down slowly from the shaded sky</l>
     <l n="184">Of even , and she said , “ My master 's son ,</l>
     <l n="185">Japhet ” ; and Japhet said , “ I am not wroth</l>
     <l n="186">With thee , but wretched for my mother 's deed ,</l>
     <l n="187">Because she shamed me . ”</l>
     <l n="188">And the maiden said ,</l>
     <l n="189">“ Doth not thy father love thee well , sweet sir ? ”</l>
     <l n="190">“ Ay , ” quoth he , “ well . ” She answered , “ Let the heart</l>
     <l n="191">Of Japhet , then , be merry . Go to him</l>
     <l n="192">And say , ‘ The damsel whom my mother chose ,</l>
     <l n="193">Sits by her in the house ; but as for me ,</l>
     <l n="194">Sir , ere I take her , let me go with you</l>
     <l n="195">To that same outland country . Also , sir ,</l>
     <l n="196">My damsel hath not worked as yet the robe</l>
     <l n="197">Of her betrothal ’ ; now , then , sith he loves ,</l>
     <l n="198">He will not say thee nay . Herein for awhile</l>
     <l n="199">Is respite , and thy mother far and near</l>
     <l n="200">Will seek again : it may be she will find</l>
     <l n="201">A fair , free maiden . ”</l>
     <l n="202">Japhet said , “ O maid ,</l>
     <l n="203">Sweet are thy words ; but what if I return ,</l>
     <l n="204">And all again be as it is to-day ? ”</l>
     <l n="205">Then Amarant answered , “ Some have died in youth ;</l>
     <l n="206">But yet , I think not , sir , that I shall die .</l>
     <l n="207">Though ye shall find it even as I had died ,—</l>
     <l n="208">Silent , for any words I might have said ;</l>
     <l n="209">Empty , for any space I might have filled .</l>
     <l n="210">Sir , I will steal away , and hide afar ;</l>
     <l n="211">But if a wife be found , then will I bide</l>
     <l n="212">And serve . ” He answered , “ O , thy speech is good ;</l>
     <l n="213">Now therefore ( since my mother gave me thee ) ,</l>
     <l n="214">I will reward it ; I will find for thee</l>
     <l n="215">A goodly husband , and will make him free</l>
     <l n="216">Thee also . ”</l>
     <l n="217">Then she started from his feet ,</l>
     <l n="218">And , red with shame and anger , flashed on him</l>
     <l n="219">The passion of her eyes ; and put her hands</l>
     <l n="220">With catching of the breath to her fair throat ,</l>
     <l n="221">And stood in her defiance lost to fear ,</l>
     <l n="222">Like some fair hind in desperate danger turned</l>
     <l n="223">And brought to bay , and wild in her despair .</l>
     <l n="224">But shortly , “ I remember , ” quoth she , low ,</l>
     <l n="225">With raining down of tears and broken sighs ,</l>
     <l n="226">“ That I am Japhet 's slave ; beseech you , sir ,</l>
     <l n="227">As ye were ever gentle , ay , and sweet</l>
     <l n="228">Of language to me , be not harder now .</l>
     <l n="229">Sir , I was yours to take ; I knew not , sir ,</l>
     <l n="230">That also ye might give me . Pray you , sir ,</l>
     <l n="231">Be pitiful ,— be merciful to me ,</l>
     <l n="232">A slave . ” He said , “ I thought to do thee good ,</l>
     <l n="233">For good hath been thy counsel ” ; but she cried ,</l>
     <l n="234">“ Good master , be you therefore pitiful</l>
     <l n="235">To me , a slave . ” And Japhet wondered much</l>
     <l n="236">At her , and at her beauty , for he thought ,</l>
     <l n="237">“ None of the daughters are so fair as this ,</l>
     <l n="238">Nor stand with such a grace majestical ;</l>
     <l n="239">She in her locks is like the travelling sun ,</l>
     <l n="240">Setting , all clad in coifing clouds of gold .</l>
     <l n="241">And would she die unmatched ? ” He said to her ,</l>
     <l n="242">“ What ! wilt thou sail alone in yonder ship ,</l>
     <l n="243">And dwell alone hereafter ? ” “ Ay , ” she said ,</l>
     <l n="244">“ And serve my mistress . ”</l>
     <l n="245">“ It is well , ” quoth he ,</l>
     <l n="246">And held his hand to her , as is the way</l>
     <l n="247">Of masters . Then she kissed it , and she said ,</l>
     <l n="248">“ Thanks for benevolence , ” and turned herself ,</l>
     <l n="249">Adding , “ I rest , sir , on your gracious words ” ;</l>
     <l n="250">Then stepped into the twilight and was gone .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="251">And Japhet , having found his father , said ,</l>
     <l n="252">“ Sir , let me also journey when ye go . ”</l>
     <l n="253">Who answered , “ Hath thy mother done her part ? ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="254">He said , “ Yea , truly , and my damsel sits</l>
     <l n="255">Before her in the house ; and also , sir ,</l>
     <l n="256">She said to me , ‘ I have not worked , as yet ,</l>
     <l n="257">The garment of betrothal . ’ ” And he said ,</l>
     <l n="258">“ ‘ Tis not the manner of our kin to speak</l>
     <l n="259">Concerning matters that a woman rules ;</l>
     <l n="260">But hath thy mother brought a damsel home ,</l>
     <l n="261">And let her see thy face , then all is one</l>
     <l n="262">As ye were wed . ” He answered , “ Even so ,</l>
     <l n="263">It matters nothing ; therefore hear me , sir :</l>
     <l n="264">The damsel being mine , I am content</l>
     <l n="265">To let her do according to her will ;</l>
     <l n="266">And when we shall return , so surely , sir ,</l>
     <l n="267">As I shall find her by my mother 's side ,</l>
     <l n="268">Then will I take her ” ; and he left to speak ;</l>
     <l n="269">His father answering , “ Son , thy words are good . ”</l>

     <l n="1">Night . Now a tent was pitched , and Japhet sat</l>
     <l n="2">In the door and watched , for on a litter lay</l>
     <l n="3">The father of his love . And he was sick</l>
     <l n="4">To death ; but daily he would rouse him up ,</l>
     <l n="5">And stare upon the light , and ever say ,</l>
     <l n="6">“ On , let us journey ” ; but it came to pass</l>
     <l n="7">That night , across their path a river ran ,</l>
     <l n="8">And they who served the father and the son</l>
     <l n="9">Had pitched the tents beside it , and had made</l>
     <l n="10">A fire , to scare away the savagery</l>
     <l n="11">That roamed in that great forest , for their way</l>
     <l n="12">Had led among the trees of God .</l>
     <l n="13">The moon</l>
     <l n="14">Shone on the river , like a silver road</l>
     <l n="15">To lead them over ; but when Japhet looked ,</l>
     <l n="16">He said , “ We shall not cross it . I shall lay</l>
     <l n="17">This well-belovéd head low in the leaves ,—</l>
     <l n="18">Not on the farther side . ” From time to time ,</l>
     <l n="19">The water-snakes would stir its glassy flow</l>
     <l n="20">With curling undulations , and would lay</l>
     <l n="21">Their heads along the bank , and , subtle-eyed ,</l>
     <l n="22">Consider those long spirting flames , that danced ,</l>
     <l n="23">When some red log would break and crumble down ;</l>
     <l n="24">And show his dark despondent eyes , that watched ,</l>
     <l n="25">Wearily , even Japhet 's . But he cared</l>
     <l n="26">Little ; and in the dark , that was not dark ,</l>
     <l n="27">But dimness of confused incertitude ,</l>
     <l n="28">Would move a-near all silently , and gaze</l>
     <l n="29">And breathe , and shape itself , a manéd thing</l>
     <l n="30">With eyes ; and still he cared not , and the form</l>
     <l n="31">Would falter , then recede , and melt again</l>
     <l n="32">Into the farther shade . And Japhet said :</l>
     <l n="33">“ How long ? The moon hath grown again in heaven ,</l>
     <l n="34">After her caving twice , since we did leave</l>
     <l n="35">The threshold of our home ; and now what ‘ vails</l>
     <l n="36">That far on tumbled mountain snow we toiled ,</l>
     <l n="37">Hungry , and weary , all the day ; by night</l>
     <l n="38">Waked with a dreadful trembling underneath ,</l>
     <l n="39">To look , while every cone smoked , and there ran</l>
     <l n="40">Red brooks adown , that licked the forest up ,</l>
     <l n="41">While in the pale white ashes wading on</l>
     <l n="42">We saw no stars ?— what ‘ vails if afterward ,</l>
     <l n="43">Astonished with great silence , we did move</l>
     <l n="44">Over the measureless , unknown desert mead ;</l>
     <l n="45">While all the day , in rents and crevices ,</l>
     <l n="46">Would lie the lizard and the serpent kind ,</l>
     <l n="47">Drowsy ; and in the night take fearsome shapes ,</l>
     <l n="48">And oft-times woman-faced and woman-haired</l>
     <l n="49">Would trail their snaky length , and curse and mourn ;</l>
     <l n="50">Or there would wander up , when we were tired ,</l>
     <l n="51">Dark troops of evil ones , with eyes morose ,</l>
     <l n="52">Withstanding us , and staring ;— O ! what ‘ vails</l>
     <l n="53">That in the dread deep forest we have fought</l>
     <l n="54">With following packs of wolves ? These men of might ,</l>
     <l n="55">Even the giants , shall not hear the doom</l>
     <l n="56">My father came to tell them of . Ah , me !</l>
     <l n="57">If God indeed had sent him , would he lie</l>
     <l n="58">( For he is stricken with a sore disease )</l>
     <l n="59">Helpless outside their city ? ”</l>
     <l n="60">Then he rose ,</l>
     <l n="61">And put aside the curtains of the tent ,</l>
     <l n="62">To look upon his father 's face ; and lo !</l>
     <l n="63">The tent being dark , he thought that somewhat sat</l>
     <l n="64">Beside the litter ; and he set his eyes</l>
     <l n="65">To see it , and saw not ; but only marked</l>
     <l n="66">Where , fallen away from manhood and from power ,</l>
     <l n="67">His father lay . Then he came forth again ,</l>
     <l n="68">Trembling , and crouched beside the dull red fire ,</l>
     <l n="69">And murmured , “ Now it is the second time :</l>
     <l n="70">An old man , as I think ( but scarcely saw ) .</l>
     <l n="71">Dreadful of might . Its hair was white as wool :</l>
     <l n="72">I dared not look ; perhaps I saw not aught ,</l>
     <l n="73">But only knew that it was there : the same</l>
     <l n="74">Which walked beside us once when he did pray . ”</l>
     <l n="75">And Japhet hid his face between his hands</l>
     <l n="76">For fear , and grief of heart , and weariness</l>
     <l n="77">Of watching ; and he slumbered not , but mourned</l>
     <l n="78">To himself , a little moment , as it seemed ,</l>
     <l n="79">For sake of his loved father : then he lift</l>
     <l n="80">His eyes , and day had dawned . Right suddenly</l>
     <l n="81">The moon withheld her silver , and she hung</l>
     <l n="82">Frail as a cloud . The ruddy flame that played ,</l>
     <l n="83">By night on dim , dusk trees , and on the flood ,</l>
     <l n="84">Crept red amongst the logs , and all the world</l>
     <l n="85">And all the water blushed and bloomed . The stars</l>
     <l n="86">Were gone , and golden shafts came up , and touched</l>
     <l n="87">The feathered heads of palms , and green was born</l>
     <l n="88">Under the rosy cloud , and purples flew</l>
     <l n="89">Like veils across the mountains ; and he saw ,</l>
     <l n="90">Winding athwart them , bathed in blissful peace ,</l>
     <l n="91">And the sacredness of morn , the battlements</l>
     <l n="92">And out-posts of the giants ; and there ran</l>
     <l n="93">On the other side the river , as it were ,</l>
     <l n="94">White mounds of marble , tabernacles fair ,</l>
     <l n="95">And towers below a line of inland cliff :</l>
     <l n="96">These were their fastnesses , and here their homes .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="97">In valleys and the forest , all that night ,</l>
     <l n="98">There had been woe ; in every hollow place ,</l>
     <l n="99">And under walls , like drifted flowers , or snow ,</l>
     <l n="100">Women lay mourning ; for the serpent lodged</l>
     <l n="101">That night within the gates , and had decreed ,</l>
     <l n="102">“ I will ( or ever I come ) that ye drive out</l>
     <l n="103">The women , the abhorred of my soul . ”</l>
     <l n="104">Therefore , more beauteous than all climbing bloom ,</l>
     <l n="105">Purple and scarlet , cumbering of the boughs ,</l>
     <l n="106">Or flights of azure doves that lit to drink</l>
     <l n="107">The water of the river ; or , new born ,</l>
     <l n="108">The quivering butterflies in companies ,</l>
     <l n="109">That slowly crept adown the sandy marge ,</l>
     <l n="110">Like living crocus beds , and also drank ,</l>
     <l n="111">And rose an orange cloud ; their hollowed hands</l>
     <l n="112">They dipped between the lilies , or with robes</l>
     <l n="113">Full of ripe fruitage , sat and peeled and ate ,</l>
     <l n="114">Weeping ; or comforting their little ones ,</l>
     <l n="115">And lulling them with sorrowful long hymns</l>
     <l n="116">Among the palms .</l>
     <l n="117">So went the earlier morn .</l>
     <l n="118">Then came a messenger , while Japhet sat</l>
     <l n="119">Mournfully , and he said , “ The men of might</l>

     <l n="121">And Japhet said , “ So be it ” ; and he thought ,</l>
     <l n="122">“ Now will I trust in God ” ; and he went in</l>
     <l n="123">And stood before his father , and he said ,</l>
     <l n="124">“ My father ” ; but the Master answered not ,</l>
     <l n="125">But gazed upon the curtains of his tent ,</l>
     <l n="126">Nor knew that one had called him . He was clad</l>
     <l n="127">As ready for the journey , and his feet</l>
     <l n="128">Were sandalled , and his staff was at his side ;</l>
     <l n="129">And Japhet took the gown of sacrifice</l>
     <l n="130">And spread it on him , and he laid his crown</l>
     <l n="131">Upon his knees , and he went forth , and lift</l>
     <l n="132">His hand to heaven , and cried , “ My father 's God ! ”</l>
     <l n="133">But neither whisper came nor echo fell</l>
     <l n="134">When he did listen . Therefore he went on :</l>
     <l n="135">“ Behold , I have a thing to say to thee .</l>

     <l n="145">Then cried he to his people , “ Let us hence :</l>

     <l n="147">Toward the raft whereby men crossed that flood .</l>
     <l n="148">And while they journeyed , lo , the giants sat</l>

     <l n="17">With golden baskets , red pomegranates shred</l>
     <l n="18">To fill them ; and the rubied censers smoke ,</l>
     <l n="19">Heaped up with ambergris and cinnamon ,</l>

     <l n="21">Japhet said ,</l>

     <l n="26">“ Where is our father ? doth he preach to-day ? ”</l>
     <l n="27">And Japhet answered , “ Yea . He said to me ,</l>

     <l n="33">Then he did tell him of the giant folk :</l>

     <l n="35">How one must stride that will ascend the steps</l>
     <l n="36">That lead to their wide halls ; and how they drave ,</l>
     <l n="37">With manful shouts , the mammoth to the north ;</l>
     <l n="38">And how the talking dragon lied and fawned ,</l>
     <l n="39">They seated proudly on their ivory thrones ,</l>

     <l n="46">To signify much blood ): and of their pride</l>
     <l n="47">He told , but of the vision in the tent</l>
     <l n="48">He told him not .</l>
     <l n="49">And when they reached the house ,</l>
     <l n="50">Niloiya met them , and to Japhet cried ,</l>

     <l n="53">The late ripe corn . ” So he went in with her ,</l>
     <l n="54">And she did talk with him right motherly :</l>
     <l n="55">“ It hath been fully told me how ye loathed</l>
     <l n="56">To wed thy father 's slave ; yea , she herself ,</l>
     <l n="57">Did she not all declare to me ? ”</l>
     <l n="58">He said ,</l>

     <l n="60">“ Yea , ” quoth his mother ; “ she made clear to me</l>

     <l n="64">“ I know it . ” Quoth the mother , “ It is well ;</l>
     <l n="65">For that same cause is laughter in my heart . ”</l>
     <l n="66">“ But she is sweet of language , ” Japhet said .</l>
     <l n="67">“ Ay , ” quoth Niloiya , “ and thy wife no less</l>
     <l n="68">Whom thou shalt wed anon ,— forsooth , anon ,—</l>
     <l n="69">It is a lucky hour . Thou wilt ? ” He said ,</l>
     <l n="70">“ I will . ” And Japhet laid the slender sheaf</l>
     <l n="71">From off his shoulder , and he said , “ Behold ,</l>
     <l n="72">My father ! ” Then Niloiya turned herself ,</l>
     <l n="73">And lo ! the shipwright stood . “ All hail ! ” quoth she .</l>
     <l n="74">And bowed herself , and kissed him on the mouth ;</l>
     <l n="75">But while she spake with him , sorely he sighed ;</l>
     <l n="76">And she did hang about his neck the robe</l>
     <l n="77">Of feasting , and she poured upon his hands</l>
     <l n="78">Clear water , and anointed him , and set</l>
     <l n="79">Before him bread .</l>

     <l n="86">And when Niloiya heard ,</l>
     <l n="87">She said , “ Is this a time for mirth of heart</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="92">He answered , “ Yea , it is a time of times ;</l>

     <l n="98">With all her slaves by sundown . ”</l>
     <l n="99">And she said ,</l>

     <l n="122">The garment of betrothal . And with that</l>
     <l n="123">A noise , and then brake in a woman slave</l>
     <l n="124">And Amarant . This , with folding of her hands ,</l>
     <l n="125">Did say full meekly , “ If I do offend ,</l>

     <l n="128">Herself to tell her errand . ”</l>
     <l n="129">And they sat .</l>
     <l n="130">Then spoke the woman , “ If I do offend ,</l>
     <l n="131">Pray you forgive the bondslave , for her tongue</l>
     <l n="132">Is for her mistress . ‘ Lo ! ’ my mistress saith ,</l>
     <l n="133">‘ Put off thy bravery , bridegroom ; fold away ,</l>

     <l n="136">Thy master . Lo , to-day right evil things</l>
     <l n="137">He prophesied to us , that were his friends ;</l>
     <l n="138">Therefore , my answer :— God do so to me ;</l>
     <l n="139">Yea , God do so to me , more also , more</l>
     <l n="140">Than He did threaten , if my damsel 's foot</l>
     <l n="141">Ever draw nigh thy door . ’ ”</l>
     <l n="142">And when she heard ,</l>
     <l n="143">Niloiya sat amazed , in grief of soul .</l>
     <l n="144">But Japhet came unto the slave , where low</l>
     <l n="145">She bowed herself for fear . He said , “ Depart ;</l>
     <l n="146">Say to thy mistress , ‘ It is well . ’ ” With that</l>
     <l n="147">She turned herself , and she made haste to flee ,</l>
     <l n="148">Lest any , for those evil words she brought ,</l>
     <l n="149">Would smite her . But the bondmaid of the house</l>
     <l n="150">Lift up her hand and said , “ If I offend ,</l>
     <l n="151">It was not of my heart : thy damsel knew</l>
     <l n="152">Naught of this matter . ” And he held to her</l>
     <l n="153">His hand and touched her , and said , “ Amarant ! ”</l>
     <l n="154">And when she looked upon him , she did take</l>
     <l n="155">And spread before her face her radiant locks ,</l>
     <l n="156">Trembling . And Japhet said , “ Lift up thy face ,</l>
     <l n="157">O fairest of the daughters , thy fair face ;</l>
     <l n="158">For , lo ! the bridegroom standeth with the robe</l>
     <l n="159">Of thy betrothal ! “ — and he took her locks</l>
     <l n="160">In his two hands to part them from her brow ,</l>
     <l n="161">And laid them on her shoulders ; and he said ,</l>
     <l n="162">“ Sweet are the blushes of thy face , ” and put</l>
     <l n="163">The robe upon her , having said , “ Behold ,</l>
     <l n="164">I have repented me ; and oft by night ,</l>
     <l n="165">In the waste wilderness , while all things slept ,</l>
     <l n="166">I thought upon thy words , for they were sweet .</l>

     <l n="167">“ For this I make thee free . And now thyself</l>

     <l n="169">Thou art of beauty more than any thought</l>
     <l n="170">I had concerning thee . Let , then , this robe ,</l>
     <l n="171">Wrought on with imagery of fruitful bough ,</l>
     <l n="172">And graceful leaf , and birds with tender eyes ,</l>
     <l n="173">Cover the ripples of thy tawny hair . ”</l>
     <l n="174">So when she held her peace , he brought her nigh</l>
     <l n="175">To hear the speech of wedlock ; ay , he took</l>
     <l n="176">The golden cup of wine to drink with her ,</l>
     <l n="177">And laid the sheaf upon her arms . He said ,</l>
     <l n="178">“ Like as my fathers in the older days</l>
     <l n="179">Led home the daughters whom they chose , do I ;</l>
     <l n="180">Like as they said , ‘ Mine honor have I set</l>
     <l n="181">Upon thy head ! ’ do I . Eat of my bread ,</l>
     <l n="182">Rule in my house , be mistress of my slaves ,</l>
     <l n="183">And mother of my children . ”</l>
     <l n="184">And he brought</l>
     <l n="185">The damsel to his father , saying , “ Behold</l>
     <l n="186">My wife ! I have betrothed her to myself ;</l>
     <l n="187">I pray you , kiss her . ” And the Master did :</l>
     <l n="188">He said , “ Be mother of a multitude ,</l>
     <l n="189">And let them to their father even so</l>
     <l n="190">Be found , as he is found to me . ”</l>
     <l n="191">With that</l>
     <l n="192">She answered , “ Let this woman , sir , find grace</l>
     <l n="193">And favor in your sight . ”</l>
     <l n="194">And Japhet said ,</l>
     <l n="195">“ Sweet mother , I have wed the maid ye chose</l>
     <l n="196">And brought me first . I leave her in thy hand ;</l>
     <l n="197">Have care on her , till I shall come again</l>
     <l n="198">And ask her of thee . ” So they went apart ,</l>

     <l n="105">And at his feet</l>
     <l n="106">The wives of his two other sons did kneel ,</l>
     <l n="107">And wring their hands .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="108">One cried , “ O , speak to us ;</l>
     <l n="109">We are affrighted ; we have dreamed a dream ,</l>
     <l n="110">Each to herself . For me , I saw in mine</l>
     <l n="111">The grave old angels , like to shepherds , walk ,</l>
     <l n="112">Much cattle following them . Thy daughter looked ,</l>
     <l n="113">And they did enter here . ”</l>
     <l n="114">The other lay</l>
     <l n="115">And moaned , “ Alas ! O father , for my dream</l>
     <l n="116">Was evil : lo , I heard when it was dark ,</l>
     <l n="117">I heard two wicked ones contend for me .</l>
     <l n="118">One said , ‘ And wherefore should this woman live ,</l>
     <l n="119">When only for her children , and for her ,</l>
     <l n="120">Is woe and degradation ? ’ Then he laughed ,</l>
     <l n="121">The other crying , ‘ Let alone , O prince ;</l>
     <l n="122">Hinder her not to live and bear much seed ,</l>
     <l n="123">Because I hate her . ’ ”</l>
     <l n="124">But he said , “ Rise up ,</l>
     <l n="125">Daughters of Noah , for I have learned no words</l>
     <l n="126">To comfort you . ” Then spake her lord to her ,</l>
     <l n="127">“ Peace ! or I swear that for thy dream , myself</l>
     <l n="128">Will hate thee also . ”</l>
     <l n="129">And Niloiya said ,</l>
     <l n="130">“ My sons , if one of you will hear my words ,</l>
     <l n="131">Go now , look out , and tell me of the day ,</l>
     <l n="132">How fares it ? ”</l>
     <l n="133">And the fateful darkness grew .</l>
     <l n="134">But Shem went up to do his mother 's will ;</l>
     <l n="135">And all was one as though the frighted earth</l>
     <l n="136">Quivered and fell a-trembling ; then they hid</l>
     <l n="137">Their faces every one , till he returned ,</l>
     <l n="138">And spake not . “ Nay , ” they cried , “ what hast thou seen ?</l>
     <l n="139">O , is it come to this ? ” He answered them ,</l>
     <l n="140">“ The door is shut . ”</l>

   <p>Of the three sons of Noah ,— Shem , Ham , and Japhet ,— I have called Japhet the youngest ( because he is always named last ) , and have supposed that , in the genealogies where he is called “ Japhet the elder , ” he may have received the epithet because by that time there were younger Japhets .</p>

     <l n="2">That slowly crept adown the sandy marge ,</l>
     <l n="3">Like living crocus beds .</l>

   <p>This beautiful comparison is taken from “ The Naturalist on the River Amazons . ” “ Vast numbers of orange-colored butterflies congregated on the moist sands . They assembled in densely-packed masses , sometimes two or three yards in circumference , their wings all held in an upright position , so that the sands looked as though variegated with beds of crocuses . ”</p>
