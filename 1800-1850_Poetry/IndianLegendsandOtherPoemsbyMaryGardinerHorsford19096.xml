    <head>THE THUNDERBOLT .</head>
    <head>There is an artless tradition among the Indians , related by Irving , of a warrior who saw the thunderbolt lying upon the ground , with a beautifully wrought moccasin on each side of it . Thinking he had found a prize , he put on the moccasins , but they bore him away to the land of spirits , whence he never returned .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Loud pealed the thunder</l>
     <l n="2">From arsenal high ,</l>
     <l n="3">Bright flashed the lightning</l>
     <l n="4">Athwart the broad sky ;</l>
     <l n="5">Fast o'er the prairie ,</l>
     <l n="6">Through torrent and shade ,</l>

     <l n="9">Deep roared the cannon</l>
     <l n="10">Whose forge is the sun ,</l>

     <l n="12">The thunderbolt spun ;</l>
     <l n="13">O'er the thick wild wood</l>
     <l n="14">There quivered a line ,</l>
     <l n="15">Low ‘ mid the green leaves</l>
     <l n="16">Lay hunter and pine .</l>

   <lg type="poem">
    <head>THE PHANTOM BRIDE .</head>
    <head>During the Revolutionary war , a young American lady was murdered , while dressed in her bridal robe , by a party of Indians , sent by her betrothed to conduct her to the village where he was encamped . After the deed was done , they carried her long hair to her lover , who , urged by a frantic despair , hurried to the spot to assure himself of the truth of the tale , and shortly after threw himself , in battle , on the swords of his countrymen . After this event , the Indians were never successful in their warfare , the spectre of their victim presenting itself continually between them and the enemy .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">The worn bird of Freedom had furled o'er our land</l>
     <l n="2">The shattered wings , pierced by the despot 's rude hand ,</l>
     <l n="3">And stout hearts were vowing , ‘ mid havoc and strife ,</l>
     <l n="4">To Liberty , fortune , fame , honor , and life .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">The red light of Morning had scarcely betrayed</l>
     <l n="6">The sweet summer blossoms that slept in the glade ,</l>
     <l n="7">When a horseman rode forth from his camp in the wood ,</l>
     <l n="8">And paused where a cottage in loneliness stood .</l>
     <l n="9">The ruthless marauder preceded him there ,</l>
     <l n="10">For the green vines were torn from the trellis-work fair ,</l>
     <l n="11">The flowers in the garden all hoof-trodden lay ,</l>
     <l n="12">And the rafters were black with the smoke of the fray :</l>
     <l n="13">But the desolate building he heeded not long ,</l>
     <l n="14">Was it echo , the wind , or the notes of a song ?</l>
     <l n="15">One moment for doubt , and he stood by the side</l>
     <l n="16">Of the dark-eyed young maiden , his long-promised bride .</l>
     <l n="17">Few and short were their words , for the camp of the foe</l>
     <l n="18">Was but severed from them , by a stream 's narrow flow ,</l>
     <l n="19">And her fair cheek grew pale at the forest bird 's start ,</l>
     <l n="20">But he said , as he mounted his steed to depart ,</l>
     <l n="21">“ Nay , fear not , but trust to the chief for thy guide ,</l>
     <l n="22">And the light of the morrow shall see thee my bride . ”</l>
     <l n="23">Why faltered the words ere the sentence was o'er ?</l>
     <l n="24">Why trembled each heart like the surf on the shore ?</l>
     <l n="25">In a marvellous legend of old it is said ,</l>
     <l n="26">That the cross where the Holy One suffered and bled</l>
     <l n="27">Was built of the aspen , whose pale silver leaf ,</l>
     <l n="28">Has ever more quivered with horror and grief ;</l>
     <l n="29">And e'er since the hour , when thy pinion of light</l>
     <l n="30">Was sullied in Eden , and doomed , through a night</l>
     <l n="31">Of Sin and of Sorrow , to struggle above ,</l>
     <l n="32">Hast thou been a trembler , O beautiful Love !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="33">‘ T was the deep hush of midnight ; the stars from the sky</l>
     <l n="34">Looked down with the glance of a seraph 's bright eye ,</l>
     <l n="35">When it cleaveth in vision from Deity 's shrine</l>
     <l n="36">Through infinite space and creation divine ,</l>
     <l n="37">As the maiden came forth for her bridal arrayed ,</l>
     <l n="38">And was led by the red men through forest and shade ,</l>
     <l n="39">Till they paused where a fountain gushed clear in its play ,</l>
     <l n="40">And the tall pines rose dark and sublime o'er their way .</l>
     <l n="41">Alas for the visions that , joyous and pure ,</l>
     <l n="42">Wove a vista of light through the Future 's obscure !</l>
     <l n="43">Contention waxed fierce ‘ neath the evergreen boughs ,</l>
     <l n="44">And the braves of the chieftain were false to his vows ;</l>
     <l n="45">In vain knelt the Pale-Face to merciless wrath ,</l>
     <l n="46">The tomahawk gleamed on her desolate path ,</l>
     <l n="47">One prayer for her lover , one look towards the sky ,</l>
     <l n="48">And the dark hand of Death closed the love-speaking eye .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="49">They covered with dry leaves the cold corpse and fair ,</l>
     <l n="50">And bore the long tresses of soft , golden hair ,</l>
     <l n="51">In silence and fear , through the dense forest wide ,</l>
     <l n="52">To the home that the lover had made for his bride .</l>
     <l n="53">He knew by their waving those tresses of gold ,</l>
     <l n="54">Now damp with the life-blood that darkened each fold ,</l>
     <l n="55">And , mounting his steed , pausing never for breath</l>
     <l n="56">Sought the spot where the huge trees stood sentries of Death ;</l>
     <l n="57">Tore wildly the leaves from the loved form away ,</l>
     <l n="58">And kissed the pale lips of inanimate clay .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="59">But hark ! through the green wood what sounded afar ,</l>
     <l n="60">‘ T was the trumpet 's loud peal — the alarum of war !</l>
     <l n="61">Again on his charger , through forest , o'er plain ,</l>
     <l n="62">The soldier rode swift to his ranks ‘ mid the slain :</l>
     <l n="63">They faltered , they wavered , half turning to fly</l>
     <l n="64">As their leader dashed frantic and fearlessly by ,</l>
     <l n="65">The damp turf grew crimson wherever he trod ,</l>
     <l n="66">Where his sword was uplifted a soul went to God .</l>
     <l n="67">But that brave arm alone might not conquer in strife ,</l>
     <l n="68">The madness of grief was conflicting with Life ;</l>
     <l n="69">His steed fell beneath him , the death-shot whizzed by ,</l>
     <l n="70">And he rushed on the swords of the victors to die .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="71">‘ Neath the murmuring pine trees they laid side by side ,</l>
     <l n="72">The gallant young soldier , the fair , murdered bride :</l>
     <l n="73">And never again from that traitorous night ,</l>
     <l n="74">The red man dared stand in the battle 's fierce storm ,</l>
     <l n="75">For ever before him a phantom of light ,</l>
     <l n="76">Rose up in the white maiden 's beautiful form ;</l>
     <l n="77">And when he would rush on the foe from his lair ,</l>
     <l n="78">Those locks of pale gold floated past on the air .</l>
    </lg>

   <lg type="poem">
    <head>THE LAUGHING WATER .</head>
    <head>The Indian name for the Falls of St. Anthony signifies “ Laughing Water , ” and here tradition says that a young woman of the Dahcotah tribe , the father of her children having taken another wife , unmoored her canoe above the fall , and placing herself and children in it , sang her death-song as she went over the foaming declivity .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">The sun went down the west</l>
     <l n="2">As a warrior to his grave ,</l>
     <l n="3">And touched with crimson hue</l>
     <l n="4">The “ Laughing Water 's ” wave ;</l>
     <l n="5">And where the current swept</l>
     <l n="6">A quick , convulsive flood ,</l>
     <l n="7">Serene upon the brink</l>
     <l n="8">An Indian mother stood .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">With calm and serious gaze</l>
     <l n="10">She watched the torrent blue</l>
     <l n="11">And then with skilful hand</l>
     <l n="12">Unmoored the birch canoe ,</l>
     <l n="13">Seized the light oar , and placed</l>
     <l n="14">Her infants by her side ,</l>
     <l n="15">And steered the fragile bark</l>
     <l n="16">On through the rushing tide .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="17">Then fitfully and wild</l>
     <l n="18">In thrilling notes of woe</l>
     <l n="19">Swept down the rapid stream</l>
     <l n="20">The death-song sad and low ;</l>
     <l n="21">And gathered on the marge ,</l>
     <l n="22">From many a forest glen ,</l>
     <l n="23">With frantic gestures rude ,</l>
     <l n="24">The red Dahcotah men .</l>
     <l n="25">But onward sped the bark</l>
     <l n="26">Until it reached the height ,</l>
     <l n="27">Where mounts the angry spray</l>
     <l n="28">And raves the water 's might</l>
     <l n="29">And whirling eddies swept</l>
     <l n="30">Into the gulf below</l>
     <l n="31">The smiles of infancy</l>
     <l n="32">And youth 's maturer glow ;</l>
     <l n="33">The priestess of the rock</l>
     <l n="34">And white-robed surges bore</l>
     <l n="35">The wronged and broken heart</l>
     <l n="36">To the far off Spirit Shore .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="37">And often when the night</l>
     <l n="38">Has drawn her shadowy veil ,</l>
     <l n="39">And solemn stars look forth</l>
     <l n="40">Serenely pure and pale ,</l>
     <l n="41">A spectre bark and form</l>
     <l n="42">May still be seen to glide ,</l>
     <l n="43">In wondrous silence down</l>
     <l n="44">The Laughing Water 's tide .</l>
     <l n="45">And mingling with the breath</l>
     <l n="46">Of low winds sweeping free ,</l>
     <l n="47">The night-bird 's fitful plaint ,</l>
     <l n="48">And moaning forest tree ,</l>
     <l n="49">Amid the lulling chime</l>
     <l n="50">Of waters falling there ,</l>
     <l n="51">The death-song floats again</l>
     <l n="52">Upon the laden air .</l>

    <head>THE LAST OF THE RED MEN .</head>
    <head>Travellers in Mexico have found the form of a serpent invariably pictured over the doorways of the Indian Temples , and on the interior walls , the impression of a red hand .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">The superstitions attached to the phenomena of the thunderstorm and</l>
     <l n="2">Aurora Borealis , alluded to in the poem , are well authenticated .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">I saw him in vision ,— the last of that race</l>
     <l n="4">Who were destined to vanish before the Pale-face ,</l>
     <l n="5">As the dews of the evening from mountain and dale ,</l>
     <l n="6">When the thirsty young Morning withdraws her dark veil ;</l>
     <l n="7">Alone with the Past and the Future 's chill breath ,</l>
     <l n="8">Like a soul that has entered the valley of Death .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">He stood where of old from the Fane of the Sun ,</l>
     <l n="10">While cycles unnumbered their centuries run ,</l>
     <l n="11">Never quenched , never fading , and mocking at Time ,</l>
     <l n="12">Blazed the fire sacerdotal far o'er the fair clime ;</l>
     <l n="13">Where the temples o'ershadowed the Mexican plain ,</l>
     <l n="14">And the hosts of the Aztec were conquered and slain ;</l>
     <l n="15">Where the Red Hand still glows on pilaster and wall ,</l>
     <l n="16">And the serpent keeps watch o'er the desolate hall .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="17">He stood as an oak , on the bleak mountainside ,</l>

    <head>THE JUDGMENT OF THE DEAD .</head>
    <head>Diodorus has recorded an impressive Egyptian ceremonial , the judgment of the dead by the living . When the corpse , duly embalmed , had been placed by the margin of the Acherusian Lake , and before consigning it to the bark that was to bear it across the waters to its final resting-place , it was permitted to the appointed judges to hear all accusations against the past life of the deceased , and if proved , to deprive the corpse of the rites of sepulture . From this singular law not even kings were exempt .</head>

     <l n="7">The victor 's laurel at his feet ;</l>
