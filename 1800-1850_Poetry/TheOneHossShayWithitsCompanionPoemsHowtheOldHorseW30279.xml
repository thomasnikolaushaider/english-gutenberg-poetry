    <head>Preface</head>
    <p n="1">My publishers suggested the bringing together of the three poems here presented to the reader as being to some extent alike in their general character . “ The Wonderful One-Hoss Shay ” is a perfectly intelligible conception , whatever material difficulties it presents . It is conceivable that a being of an order superior to humanity should so understand the conditions of matter that he could construct a machine which should go to pieces , if not into its constituent atoms , at a given moment of the future . The mind may take a certain pleasure in this picture of the impossible . The event follows as a logical consequence of the presupposed condition of things .</p>
    <p n="2">There is a practical lesson to be got out of the story . Observation shows us in what point any particular mechanism is most likely to give way . In a wagon , for instance , the weak point is where the axle enters the hub or nave . When the wagon breaks down , three times out of four , I think , it is at this point that the accident occurs . The workman should see to it that this part should never give way ; then find the next vulnerable place , and so on , until he arrives logically at the perfect result attained by the deacon .</p>

  <body>
   <p>Unquestionably there is something a little like extravagance in “ How the Old Horse won the Bet , ” which taxes the credulity of experienced horsemen . Still there have been a good many surprises in the history of the turf and the trotting course .</p>
   <p>The Godolphin Arabian was taken from ignoble drudgery to become the patriarch of the English racing stock .</p>
   <p>Old Dutchman was transferred from between the shafts of a cart to become a champion of the American trotters in his time .</p>
   <p>“ Old Blue , ” a famous Boston horse of the early decades of this century , was said to trot a mile in less than three minutes , but I do not find any exact record of his achievements .</p>
   <p>Those who have followed the history of the American trotting horse are aware of the wonderful development of speed attained in these last years . The lowest time as yet recorded is by Maud S. in 2. 08-3 / 4 .</p>
   <p>If there are any anachronisms or other inaccuracies in this story , the reader will please to remember that the narrator 's memory is liable to be at fault , and if the event recorded interests him , will not worry over any little slips or stumbles .</p>
   <p>The terrible witchcraft drama of 1692 has been seriously treated , as it well deserves to be . The story has been told in two large volumes by the Rev . Charles Wentworth Upham , and in a small and more succinct volume , based upon his work , by his daughter-in-law , Caroline E. Upham .</p>
   <p>The delusion commonly spoken of , as if it belonged to Salem , was more widely diffused through the towns of Essex County . Looking upon it as a pitiful and long dead and buried superstition , I trust my poem will no more offend the good people of Essex County than Tam O'Shanter worries the honest folk of Ayrshire .</p>
   <p>The localities referred to are those with which I am familiar in my drives about Essex County .</p>
