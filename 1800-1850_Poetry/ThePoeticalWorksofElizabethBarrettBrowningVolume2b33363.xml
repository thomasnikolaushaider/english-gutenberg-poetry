   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 6 ]</span>A fact rendered pathetically historical by Mr. Horne 's report of his Commission . The name of the poet of “ Orion ” and “ Cosmo de ’ Medici ” has , however , a change of associations , and comes in time to remind me that we have some noble poetic heat of literature still ,— however open to the reproach of being somewhat gelid in our humanity — 1844 .</p>
