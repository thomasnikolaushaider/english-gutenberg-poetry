    <head>PREFACE</head>
    <p n="1">In this book I have sought to trace the course of our religious poetry from an early period of our literary history .</p>
    <p n="2">This could hardly be done without reference to some of the principal phases of the religious history of the nation . To give anything like a full history of the religious feeling of a single county , would require a large book , and — not to mention sermons — would involve a thorough acquaintance with the hymns of the country ,— a very wide subject , which I have not considered of sufficient importance from a literary point of view to come within the scope of the volume .</p>
    <p n="3">But if its poetry be the cream of a people 's thought , some true indications of the history of its religious feeling must be found in its religious verse , and I hope I have not altogether failed in setting forth these indications .</p>
    <p n="4">My chief aim , however , will show itself to have been the mediating towards an intelligent and cordial sympathy betwixt my readers and the writers from whom I have quoted . In this I have some confidence of success .</p>
    <p n="5">Heartily do I throw this my small pebble at the head of the great Sabbath-breaker Schism .</p>

    <head>INTRODUCTION .</head>
    <p n="6">If the act of worship be the highest human condition , it follows that the highest human art must find material in the modes of worship . The first poetry of a nation will not be religious poetry : the nation must have a history at least before it can possess any material capable of being cast into the mould of religious utterance ; but , the nation once possessed of this material , poetry is the first form religious utterance will assume .</p>
    <p n="7">The earliest form of literature is the ballad , which is the germ of all subsequent forms of poetry , for it has in itself all their elements : the lyric , for it was first chanted to some stringed instrument ; the epic , for it tells a tale , often of solemn and ancient report ; the dramatic , for its actors are ever ready to start forward into life , snatch the word from the mouth of the narrator , and speak in their own persons . All these forms have been used for the utterance of religious thought and feeling . Of the lyrical poems of England , religion possesses the most ; of the epic , the best ; of the dramatic , the oldest .</p>
    <p n="8">Of each of these I shall have occasion to speak ; but , as the title of the book implies ,— for Antiphon means the responsive song of the parted choir ,— I shall have chiefly to do with the lyric or song form .</p>
    <p n="9">For song is the speech of feeling . Even the prose of emotion always wanders into the rhythmical . Hence , as well as for other reasons belonging to its nature , it is one chief mode in which men unite to praise God ; for in thus praising they hold communion with each other , and the praise expands and grows .</p>
    <p n="10">The individual heart , however , must first have been uplifted into praiseful song , before the common ground and form of feeling , in virtue of which men might thus meet , could be supplied . But the vocal utterance or the bodily presence is not at all necessary for this communion . When we read rejoicingly the true song-speech of one of our singing brethren , we hold song-worship with him and with all who have thus at any time shared in his feelings , even if he have passed centuries ago into the “ high countries ” of song .</p>
    <p n="11">My object is to erect , as it were , in this book , a little auricle , or spot of concentrated hearing , where the hearts of my readers may listen , and join in the song of their country 's singing men and singing women .</p>
    <p n="12">I will build it , if I may , like a chapel in the great church of England 's worship , gathering the sounds of its never-ceasing choir , heart after heart lifting up itself in the music of speech , heart after heart responding across the ages . Hearing , we worship with them .</p>
    <p n="13">For we must not forget that , although the individual song springs from the heart of the individual , the song of a country is not merely cumulative : it is vital in its growth , and therefore composed of historically dependent members . No man could sing as he has sung , had not others sung before him . Deep answereth unto deep , face to face , praise to praise . To the sound of the trumpet the harp returns its own vibrating response — alike , but how different ! The religious song of the country , I say again , is a growth , rooted deep in all its story .</p>
    <p n="14">Besides the fact that the lyric chiefly will rouse the devotional feeling , there is another reason why I should principally use it : I wish to make my book valuable in its parts as in itself . The value of a thing depends in large measure upon its unity , its wholeness . In a work of these limits , that form of verse alone can be available for its unity which is like the song of the bird — a warble and then a stillness . However valuable an extract may be — and I shall not quite eschew such — an entire lyric , I had almost said however inferior , if worthy of a place at all , is of greater value , especially if regarded in relation to the form of setting with which I hope to surround it .</p>
    <p n="15">There is a sense in which I may , without presumption , adopt the name of Choragus , or leader of the chorus , in relation to these singers : I must take upon me to order who shall sing , when he shall sing , and which of his songs he shall sing . But I would rather assume the office of master of the hearing , for my aim shall be to cause the song to be truly heard ; to set forth worthy points in form , in matter , and in relation ; to say with regard to the singer himself , his time , its modes , its beliefs , such things as may help to set the song in its true light — its relation , namely , to the source whence it sprung , which alone can secure its right reception by the heart of the hearer . For my chief aim will be the heart ; seeing that , although there is no dividing of the one from the other , the heart can do far more for the intellect than the intellect can do for the heart .</p>
    <p n="16">We must not now attempt to hear the singers of times so old that their language is unintelligible without labour . For this there is not room , even if otherwise it were desirable that such should divide the volume . We must leave Anglo-Saxon behind us . In Early English , I shall give a few valuable lyrics , but they shall not be so far removed from our present speech but that , with a reasonable amount of assistance , the nature and degree of which I shall set forth , they shall not only present themselves to the reader 's understanding , but commend themselves to his imagination and judgment .</p>

   <head>CHAPTER I .</head>
   <head>SACRED LYRICS OF THE THIRTEENTH CENTURY .</head>
   <p>In the midst of wars and rumours of wars , the strife of king and barons , and persistent efforts to subdue neighbouring countries , the mere effervescence of the life of the nation , let us think for a moment of that to which the poems I am about to present bear good witness — the true life of the people , growing quietly , slowly , unperceived — the leaven hid in the meal . For what is the true life of a nation ? That , I answer , in its modes of thought , its manners and habits , which favours the growth within the individual of that kingdom of heaven for the sake only of which the kingdoms of earth exist . The true life of the people , as distinguished from the nation , is simply the growth in its individuals of those eternal principles of truth , in proportion to whose power in them they take rank in the kingdom of heaven , the only kingdom that can endure , all others being but as the mimicries of children playing at government .</p>
   <p>Little as they then knew of the relations of the wonderful story on which their faith was built , to everything human , the same truth was at work then which is now — poor as the recognition of these relations yet is — slowly setting men free . In the hardest winter the roots are still alive in the frozen ground .</p>
   <p>In the silence of the monastery , unnatural as that life was , germinated much of this deeper life . As we must not judge of the life of the nation by its kings and mighty men , so we must not judge of the life in the Church by those who are called Rabbi . The very notion of the kingdom of heaven implies a secret growth , secret from no affectation of mystery , but because its goings-on are in the depths of the human nature where it holds communion with the Divine . In the Church , as in society , we often find that that which shows itself uppermost is but the froth , a sign , it may be , of life beneath , but in itself worthless . When the man arises with a servant 's heart and a ruler 's brain , then is the summer of the Church 's content . But whether the men who wrote the following songs moved in some shining orbit of rank , or only knelt in some dim chapel , and walked in some pale cloister , we cannot tell , for they have left no name behind them .</p>
   <p>My reader will observe that there is little of theory and much of love in these lyrics . The recognition of a living Master is far more than any notions about him . In the worship of him a thousand truths are working , unknown and yet active , which , embodied in theory , and dissociated from the living mind that was in Christ , will as certainly breed worms as any omer of hoarded manna . Holding the skirt of his garment in one hand , we shall in the other hold the key to all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge .</p>
   <p>I think almost all the earliest religious poetry is about him and his mother . Their longing after his humanity made them idolize his mother . If we forget that only through his humanity can we approach his divinity , we shall soon forget likewise that his mother is blessed among women .</p>
   <p>I take the poems from one of the Percy Society publications , edited by Mr. Wright from a manuscript in the British Museum . He adjudges them to the reign of Edward I . Perhaps we may find in them a sign or two that in cultivating our intellect we have in some measure neglected our heart .</p>
   <p>But first as to the mode in which I present them to my readers : I have followed these rules :—</p>
   <p>1 . Wherever a word differs from the modern word only in spelling , I have , for the sake of readier comprehension , substituted the modern form , with the following exception :— Where the spelling indicates a different pronunciation , necessary for the rhyme or the measure , I retain such part of the older form , marking with an acute accent any vowel now silent which must be sounded .</p>
   <p>2 . Where the word used is antique in root , I give the modern synonym in the margin . Antique phrases I explain in foot-notes .</p>
   <p>It must be borne in mind that our modern pronunciation can hardly fail in other cases as well to injure the melody of the verses .</p>
   <p>The modern reader will often find it difficult to get a rhythm out of some of them . This may arise from any of several causes . In the first place many final e 's were then sounded which are now silent ; and it is not easy to tell which of them to sound . Again , some words were pronounced as dissyllables which we treat as monosyllables , and others as monosyllables which we treat as dissyllables . I suspect besides , that some of the old writers were content to allow a prolonged syllable to stand for two short ones , a mode not without great beauty when sparingly and judiciously employed . Short supernumerary syllables were likewise allowed considerable freedom to come and go . A good deal must , however , be put down to the carelessness and presumption of the transcribers , who may very well have been incapable of detecting their own blunders . One of these ancient mechanics of literature caused Chaucer endless annoyance with his corruptions , as a humorous little poem , the last in his works , sufficiently indicates . From the same sources no doubt spring as well most of the variations of text in the manuscripts .</p>
   <p>The first of the poems is chiefly a conversation between the Lord on the cross and his mother standing at its foot . A few prefatory remarks in explanation of some of its allusions will help my readers to enjoy it .</p>
   <p>It was at one time a common belief , and the notion has not yet , I think , altogether vanished , that the dying are held back from repose by the love that is unwilling to yield them up . Hence , in the third stanza , the Lord prays his mother to let him die . In the fifth , he reasons against her overwhelming sorrows on the ground of the deliverance his sufferings will bring to the human race . But she can only feel her own misery .</p>
   <p>To understand the seventh and eighth , it is necessary to know that , among other strange things accepted by the early Church , it was believed that the mother of Jesus had no suffering at his birth . This of course rendered her incapable of perfect sympathy with other mothers . It is a lovely invention , then , that he should thus commend mothers to his mother , telling her to judge of the pains of motherhood by those which she now endured . Still he fails to turn aside her thoughts . She is thinking still only of her own and her son 's suffering , while he continues bent on making her think of others , until , at last , forth comes her prayer for all women . This seems to me a tenderness grand as exquisite .</p>
   <p>The outburst of the chorus of the Faithful in the last stanza but one ,—</p>
   <p>When he rose , then fell her sorrow ,</p>
   <p>is as fine as anything I know in the region of the lyric .</p>

   <p>The simplicity , the tenderness , the devotion of these lyrics is to me wonderful . Observe their realism , as , for instance , in the words : “ The stones beoth al wete ; ” a realism as far removed from the coarseness of a Rubens as from the irreverence of too many religious teachers , who will repeat and repeat again the most sacred words for the merest logical ends until the tympanum of the moral ear hears without hearing the sounds that ought to be felt as well as held holiest . They bear strongly , too , upon the outcome of feeling in action , although doubtless there was the same tendency then as there is now to regard the observance of church-ordinances as the service of Christ , instead of as a means of gathering strength wherewith to serve him by being in the world as he was in the world .</p>
   <p>From a poem of forty-eight stanzas I choose five , partly in order to manifest that , although there is in it an occasional appearance of what we should consider sentimentality , allied in nature to that worship of the Virgin which is more a sort of French gallantry than a feeling of reverence , the sense of duty to the Master keeps pace with the profession of devotedness to him . There is so little continuity of thought in it , that the stanzas might almost be arranged anyhow .</p>

   <p>There were no doubt many religious poems in a certain amount of circulation of a different cast from these ; some a metrical recounting of portions of the Bible history — a kind unsuited to our ends ; others a setting forth of the doctrines and duties then believed and taught . Of the former class is one of the oldest Anglo-Saxon poems we have , that of Caedmon , and there are many specimens to be found in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries . They could , however , have been of little service to the people , so few of whom could read , or could have procured manuscripts if they had been able to use them . A long and elaborate composition of the latter class was written in the reign of Edward II . by William de Shoreham , vicar of Chart-Sutton in Kent . He probably taught his own verses to the people at his catechisings . The intention was , no doubt , by the aid of measure and rhyme to facilitate the remembrance of the facts and doctrines . It consists of a long poem on the Seven Sacraments ; of a shorter , associating the Canonical Hours with the principal events of the close of our Lord 's life ; of an exposition of the Ten Commandments , followed by a kind of treatise on the Seven Cardinal Sins : the fifth part describes the different joys of the Virgin ; the sixth , in praise of the Virgin , is perhaps the most poetic ; the last is less easy to characterize . The poem is written in the Kentish dialect , and is difficult .</p>
   <p>I shall now turn into modern verse a part of “ The Canonical Hours , ” giving its represented foundation of the various acts of worship in the Romish Church throughout the day , from early in the morning to the last service at night . After every fact concerning our Lord , follows an apostrophe to his mother , which I omit , being compelled to choose .</p>

   <p>Childlike simplicity , realism , and tenderness will be evident in this , as in preceding poems , especially in the choice of adjectives . But indeed the combination of certain words had become conventional ; as “ The hard tree , ” “ The nails great and strong , ” and such like .</p>
   <p>I know I have spoiled the poem in half-translating it thus ; but I have rendered it intelligible to all my readers , have not wandered from the original , and have retained a degree of antiqueness both in the tone and the expression .</p>
   <p>CHAPTER II .</p>
   <p>THE MIRACLE PLAYS AND OTHER POEMS OF THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY .</p>
   <p>The oldest form of regular dramatic representation in England was the Miracle Plays , improperly called Mysteries , after the French . To these plays the people of England , in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries , owed a very large portion of what religious knowledge they possessed , for the prayers were in an unknown tongue , the sermons were very few , and printing was uninvented . The plays themselves , introduced into the country by the Normans , were , in the foolish endeavour to make Normans of Anglo-Saxons , represented in Norman French<span type="note_anchor">[ 14 ]</span>until the year 1338 , when permission was obtained from the Pope to represent them in English .</p>
   <p>The word Miracle , in their case , means anything recorded in Scripture . The Miracle Plays had for their subjects the chief incidents of Old and New Testament history ; not merely , however , of this history as accepted by the Reformed Church , but of that contained in the Apocryphal Gospels as well . An entire series of these Miracles consisted of short dramatic representations of many single passages of the sacred story . The whole would occupy about three days . It began with the Creation , and ended with the Judgment . That for which the city of Coventry was famous consists of forty-two subjects , with a long prologue . Composed by ecclesiastics , the plays would seem to have been first represented by them only , although afterwards it was not always considered right for the clergy to be concerned with them . The hypocritical Franciscan friar , in “ Piers Ploughman 's Creed , ” a poem of the close of the same century , claims as a virtue for his order —</p>
   <p>At markets and miracles we meddleth us never .</p>
   <p>They would seem likewise to have been first represented in churches and chapels , sometimes in churchyards . Later , when the actors chiefly belonged to city-guilds , they were generally represented in the streets and squares .</p>
   <p>It must be borne in mind by any who would understand the influence of these plays upon the people , that much in them appearing to us grotesque , childish , absurd , and even irreverent , had no such appearance in the eyes of the spectators . A certain amount of the impression of absurdity is simply the consequence of antiquity ; and even that which is rightly regarded as absurd in the present age , will not at least have produced the discomposing effects of absurdity upon the less developed beholders of that age ; just as the quaint pictures with which their churches were decorated may make us smile , but were by them regarded with awe and reverence from their infancy .</p>
   <p>It must be confessed that there is in them even occasional coarseness ; but that the devil for instance should always be represented as a baffled fool , and made to play the buffoon sometimes after a disgusting fashion , was to them only the treatment he deserved : it was their notion of “ poetic justice ; ” while most of them were too childish to be shocked at the discord thus introduced , and many , we may well hope , too childlike to lose their reverence for the holy because of the proximity of the ridiculous .</p>
   <p>There seems to me considerably more of poetic worth scattered through these plays than is generally recognized ; and I am glad to be able to do a little to set forth the fact . I cannot doubt that my readers will be interested in such fragments as the scope and design of my book will allow me to offer . Had there been no such passages , I might have regarded the plays as but remotely connected with my purpose , and mentioned them merely as a dramatic form of religious versification . I quote from the Coventry Miracles , better known than either of the other two sets in existence , the Chester Plays and those of Widkirk Abbey . The manuscript from which they have been edited by Mr. Halliwell , one of those students of our early literature to whom we are endlessly indebted for putting valuable things within our reach , is by no means so old as the plays themselves ; it bears date 1468 , a hundred and thirty years after they appeared in their English dress . Their language is considerably modernized , a process constantly going on where transcription is the means of transmission — not to mention that the actors would of course make many changes to the speech of their own time . I shall modernize it a little further , but only as far as change of spelling will go .</p>
   <p>The first of the course is The Creation . God , and angels , and Lucifer appear . That God should here utter , I cannot say announce , the doctrine of the Trinity , may be defended on the ground that he does so in a soliloquy ; but when we find afterwards that the same doctrine is one of the subjects upon which the boy Jesus converses with the doctors in the Temple , we cannot help remarking the strange anachronism . Two remarkable lines in the said soliloquy are these :</p>

     <l n="2">It is closed in my mind .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">The next scene is the Fall of Man , which is full of poetic feeling and</l>
     <l n="4">expression both . I must content myself with a few passages .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="5">Here is part of Eve 's lamentation , when she is conscious of the death</l>

   <p>then Abraham 's Sacrifice ; then Moses and the Two Tables ; then The Prophets , each of whom prophesies of the coming Saviour ; after which we find ourselves in the Apocryphal Gospels , in the midst of much nonsense about Anna and Joachim , the parents of Mary , about Joseph and Mary and the birth of Jesus , till we arrive at The Shepherds and The Magi , The Purification , The Slaughter of the Innocents , The Disputing in the Temple , The Baptism , The Temptation , and The Woman taken in Adultery , at which point I pause for the sake of the remarkable tradition embodied in the scene — that each of the woman 's accusers thought Jesus was writing his individual sins on the ground . While he is writing the second time , the Pharisee , the Accuser , and the Scribe , who have chiefly sustained the dialogue hitherto , separate , each going into a different part of the Temple , and soliloquize thus :</p>

   <p>Upon this follows The Raising of Lazarus ; next The Council of the Jews , to which the devil appears as a Prologue , dressed in the extreme of the fashion of the day , which he sets forth minutely enough in his speech also . The Entry into Jerusalem ; The Last Supper ; The Betrayal ; King Herod ; The Trial of Christ ; Pilate 's Wife 's Dream come next ; to the subject of the last of which the curious but generally accepted origin is given , that it was inspired by Satan , anxious that Jesus should not be slain , because he dreaded the mischief he would work when he entered Hades or Hell , for there is no distinction between them either here or in the Apocryphal Gospel whence the Descent into Hell is taken . Then follow The Crucifixion and The Descent into Hell — often called the Harrowing of Hell — that is , the making war upon or despoiling of hell ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 16 ]</span>for which the authority is a passage in the Gospel of Nicodemus , full of a certain florid Eastern grandeur . I need hardly remind my readers that the Apostles ’ Creed , as it now stands , contains the same legend in the form of an article of faith . The allusions to it are frequent in the early literature of Christendom .</p>

   <p>The Burial ; The Resurrection ; The Three Maries ; Christ appearing to Mary ; The Pilgrim of Emmaus ; The Ascension ; The Descent of the Holy Ghost ; The Assumption of the Virgin ; and Doomsday , close the series . I have quoted enough to show that these plays must , in the condition of the people to whom they were presented , have had much to do with their religious education .</p>
   <p>This fourteenth century was a wonderful time of outbursting life . Although we cannot claim the Miracles as entirely English products , being in all probability translations from the Norman-French , yet the fact that they were thus translated is one remarkable amongst many in this dawn of the victory of England over her conquerors . From this time , English prospered and French decayed . Their own language was now , so far , authorized as the medium of religious instruction to the people , while a similar change had passed upon processes at law ; and , most significant of all , the greatest poet of the time , and one of the three greatest poets as yet of all English time , wrote , although a courtier , in the language of the people . Before selecting some of Chaucer 's religious verses , however , I must speak of two or three poems by other writers .</p>
   <p>The first of these is The Vision of William concerning Piers Plowman ,— a poem of great influence in the same direction as the writings of Wycliffe . It is a vision and an allegory , wherein the vices of the time , especially those of the clergy , are unsparingly dealt with . Towards the close it loses itself in a metaphysical allegory concerning Dowel , Dobet , and Dobest .<span type="note_anchor">[ 17 ]</span>I do not find much poetry in it . There is more , to my mind , in another poem , written some thirty or forty years later , the author of which is unknown , perhaps because he was an imitator of William Langland , the author of the Vision . It is called Pierce the Plough-man 's Crede . Both are written after the fashion of the Anglo-Saxon poetry , and not after the fashion of the Anglo-Norman , of which distinction a little more presently . Its object is to contrast the life and character of the four orders of friars with those of a simple Christian . There is considerable humour in the working plan of the poem .</p>
   <p>A certain poor man says he has succeeded in learning his A B C , his Paternoster , and his Ave Mary , but he cannot , do what he will , learn his Creed . He sets out , therefore , to find some one whose life , according with his profession , may give him a hope that he will teach him his creed aright . He applies to the friars . One after another , every order abuses the other ; nor this only , but for money offers either to teach him his creed , or to absolve him for ignorance of the same . He finds no helper until he falls in with Pierce the Ploughman , of whose poverty he gives a most touching description . I shall , however , only quote some lines of The Believe as taught by the Ploughman , and this principally to show the nature of the versification :</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">

     <l n="2">Holy heaven upon high wholly he formed ;</l>
     <l n="3">And is almighty himself over all his workés ;</l>
     <l n="4">And wrought as his will was , the world and the heaven ;</l>
     <l n="5">And on gentle Jesus Christ , engendered of himselven ,</l>
     <l n="6">His own only Son , Lord over all y-knowen .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">

     <l n="8">And sythen his blessed body was in a stone buried ; after that .</l>
     <l n="9">And descended adown to the dark hellé ,</l>
     <l n="10">And fetched out our forefathers ; and they full fain weren . glad .</l>
     <l n="11">The third day readily , himself rose from death ,</l>
     <l n="12">And on a stone there he stood , he stey up to heaven . where : ascended .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Here there is no rhyme . There is measure — a dance-movement in the verse ; and likewise , in most of the lines , what was essential to Anglo-Saxon verse — three or more words beginning with the same sound . This is somewhat of the nature of rhyme , and was all our Anglo-Saxon forefathers had of the kind . Their Norman conquerors brought in rhyme , regularity of measure , and division into stanzas , with many refinements of versification now regarded , with some justice and a little more injustice , as peurilities . Strange as it may seem , the peculiar rhythmic movement of the Anglo-Saxon verse is even yet the most popular of all measures . Its representative is now that kind of verse which is measured not by the number of syllables , but by the number of accented syllables . The bulk of the nation is yet Anglo-Saxon in its blind poetic tastes .</p>
   <p>Before taking my leave of this mode , I would give one fine specimen from another poem , lately printed , for the first time in full , from Bishop Percy 's manuscript . It may chronologically belong to the beginning of the next century : its proper place in my volume is here . It is called Death and Liffe . Like Langland 's poem , it is a vision ; but , short as it is in comparison , there is far more poetry in it than in Piers Plowman . Life is thus described :</p>

   <p>I now turn from those poems of national scope and wide social interest , bearing their share , doubtless , in the growth of the great changes that showed themselves at length more than a century after , and from the poem I have just quoted of a yet wider human interest , to one of another tone , springing from the grief that attends love , and the aspiration born of the grief . It is , nevertheless , wide in its scope as the conflict between Death and Life , although dealing with the individual and not with the race . The former poems named of Pierce Ploughman are the cry of John the Baptist in the English wilderness ; this is the longing of Hannah at home , having left her little son in the temple . The latter seems a poorer matter ; but it is an easier thing to utter grand words of just condemnation , than , in the silence of the chamber , or with the well-known household-life around , forcing upon the consciousness only the law of things seen , to regard with steadfastness the blank left by a beloved form , and believe in the unseen , the marvellous , the eternal . In the midst of “ the light of common day , ” with all the persistently common things pressing upon the despairing heart , to hold fast , after what fashion may be possible , the vanishing song that has changed its key , is indeed a victory over the flesh , however childish the forms in which the faith may embody itself , however weak the logic with which it may defend its intrenchments .</p>
   <p>The poem which has led me to make these remarks is in many respects noteworthy . It is very different in style and language from any I have yet given . There was little communication to blend the different modes of speech prevailing in different parts of the country . It belongs ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 24 ]</span>according to students of English , to the Midland dialect of the fourteenth century . The author is beyond conjecture .</p>
   <p>It is not merely the antiquity of the language that causes its difficulty , but the accumulated weight of artistically fantastic and puzzling requirements which the writer had laid upon himself in its composition . The nature of these I shall be enabled to show by printing the first twelve lines almost as they stand in the manuscript .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Perle plesaunte to prynces paye ,</l>
     <l n="2">To clanly clos in golde so clere !</l>

     <l n="4">Ne proued I neuer her precios pere ;</l>

   </lg>
   <p>Here it will be observed that the Norman mode — that of rhymes — is employed , and that there is a far more careful measure in the line that is found in the poem last quoted . But the rhyming is carried to such an excess as to involve the necessity of constant invention of phrase to meet its requirements — a fertile source of obscurity . The most difficult form of stanza in respect of rhyme now in use is the Spenserian , in which , consisting of nine lines , four words rhyme together , three words , and two words . But the stanza in the poem before us consists of twelve lines , six of which , two of which , four of which , rhyme together . This we should count hard enough ; but it does not nearly exhaust the tyranny of the problem the author has undertaken . I have already said that one of the essentials of the poetic form in Anglo-Saxon was the commencement of three or more words in the line with the same sound : this peculiarity he has exaggerated : every line has as many words as possible commencing with the same sound . In the first line , for instance ,— and it must be remembered that the author 's line is much shorter than the Anglo-Saxon line ,— there are four words beginning with p ; in the second , three beginning with cl , and so on . This , of course , necessitates much not merely of circumlocution , but of contrivance , involving endless obscurity .</p>
   <p>He has gone on to exaggerate the peculiarities of Norman verse as well ; but I think it better not to run the risk of wearying my reader by pointing out more of his oddities . I will now betake myself to what is far more interesting as well as valuable .</p>
   <p>The poem sets forth the grief and consolation of a father who has lost his daughter . It is called The Pearl . Here is a literal rendering , line for line , into modern English words , not modern English speech , of the stanza which I have already given in its original form :</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Pearl pleasant to prince 's pleasure ,</l>
     <l n="2">Most cleanly closed in gold so clear !</l>
     <l n="3">Out of the Orient , I boldly say ,</l>
     <l n="4">I never proved her precious equal ;</l>
     <l n="5">So round , so beautiful in every point !</l>
     <l n="6">So small , so smooth , her sides were !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="7">Wheresoever I judged gemmes gay</l>
     <l n="8">I set her singly in singleness .</l>
     <l n="9">Alas ! I lost her in an arbour ;</l>
     <l n="10">Through the grass to the ground it from me went .</l>
     <l n="11">I pine , sorely wounded by dangerous love</l>
     <l n="12">Of that especial pearl without spot .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>The father calls himself a jeweller ; the pearl is his daughter . He has lost the pearl in the grass ; it has gone to the ground , and he cannot find it ; that is , his daughter is dead and buried . Perhaps the most touching line is one in which he says to the grave :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">O moul , thou marrez a myry mele .</l>
     <l n="2">( O mould , thou marrest a merry talk . )</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The poet , who is surely the father himself , cannot always keep up the allegory ; his heart burns holes in it constantly ; at one time he says she , at another it , and , between the girl and the pearl , the poem is bewildered . But the allegory helps him out with what he means notwithstanding ; for although the highest aim of poetry is to say the deepest things in the simplest manner , humanity must turn from mode to mode , and try a thousand , ere it finds the best . The individual , in his new endeavour to make “ the word cousin to the deed , ” must take up the forms his fathers have left him , and add to them , if he may , new forms of his own . In both the great revivals of literature , the very material of poetry was allegory .</p>
   <p>The father falls asleep on his child 's grave , and has a dream , or rather a vision , of a country where everything — after the childish imagination which invents differences instead of discovering harmonies — is super-naturally beautiful : rich rocks with a gleaming glory , crystal cliffs , woods with blue trunks and leaves of burnished silver , gravel of precious Orient pearls , form the landscape , in which are delicious fruits , and birds of flaming colours and sweet songs : its loveliness no man with a tongue is worthy to describe . He comes to the bank of a river :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Swinging sweet the water did sweep</l>
     <l n="2">With a whispering speech flowing adown ;</l>
     <l n="3">( Wyth a rownande rourde raykande aryght )</l>
   </lg>
   <p>and the stones at the bottom were shining like stars . It is a noteworthy specimen of the mode in which the imagination works when invention is dissociated from observation and faith . But the sort of way in which some would improve the world now , if they might , is not so very far in advance of this would-be glorification of Nature . The barest heath and sky have lovelinesses infinitely beyond the most gorgeous of such phantasmagoric idealization of her beauties ; and the most wretched condition of humanity struggling for existence contains elements of worth and future development inappreciable by the philanthropy that would elevate them by cultivating their self-love .</p>
   <p>At the foot of a crystal cliff , on the opposite side of the river , which he cannot cross , he sees a maiden sitting , clothed and crowned with pearls , and wearing one pearl of surpassing wonder and spotlessness upon her breast . I now make the spelling and forms of the words as modern as I may , altering the text no further .</p>

   <p>Much conversation follows , the glorified daughter rebuking and instructing her father . He prays for a sight of the heavenly city of which she has been speaking , and she tells him to walk along the bank until he comes to a hill . In recording what he saw from the hill , he follows the description of the New Jerusalem given in the Book of the Revelation . He sees the Lamb and all his company , and with them again his lost Pearl . But it was not his prince 's pleasure that he should cross the stream ; for when his eyes and ears were so filled with delight that he could no longer restrain the attempt , he awoke out of his dream .</p>

   <p>This needs no comment . Even the remark that every line is worth meditation may well appear superfluous . One little fact only with regard to the rhymes , common to this and the next poem , and usual enough in Norman verse , may be pointed out , namely , that every line in the stanza ends with the same rhyme-sound as the corresponding line in each of the other stanzas . A reference to either of the poems will at once show what I mean .</p>

   <p>CHAPTER III .</p>
   <p>THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY .</p>
   <p>After the birth of a Chaucer , a Shakspere , or a Milton , it is long before the genial force of a nation can again culminate in such a triumph : time is required for the growth of the conditions . Between the birth of Chaucer and the birth of Shakspere , his sole equal , a period of more than two centuries had to elapse . It is but small compensation for this , that the more original , that is simple , natural , and true to his own nature a man is , the more certain is he to have a crowd of imitators . I do not say that such are of no use in the world . They do not indeed advance art , but they widen the sphere of its operation ; for many will talk with the man who know nothing of the master . Too often intending but their own glory , they point the way to the source of it , and are straightway themselves forgotten .</p>
   <p>Very little of the poetry of the fifteenth century is worthy of a different fate from that which has befallen it . Possibly the Wars of the Roses may in some measure account for the barrenness of the time ; but I do not think they will explain it . In the midst of the commotions of the seventeenth century we find Milton , the only English poet of whom we are yet sure as worthy of being named with Chaucer and Shakspere .</p>
   <p>It is in quality , however , and not in quantity that the period is deficient . It had a good many writers of poetry , some of them prolific . John Lydgate , the monk of Bury , a great imitator of Chaucer , was the principal of these , and wrote an enormous quantity of verse . We shall find for our use enough as it were to keep us alive in passing through this desert to the Paradise of the sixteenth century — a land indeed flowing with milk and honey . For even in the desert of the fifteenth are spots luxuriant with the rich grass of language , although they greet the eye with few flowers of individual thought or graphic speech .</p>
   <p>Rather than give portions of several of Lydgate 's poems , I will give one entire — the best I know . It is entitled , Thonke God of alle .<span type="note_anchor">[ 36 ]</span></p>

   <p>I cannot say there is much poetry in this , but there is much truth and wisdom . There is the finest poetry , however , too , in the line — I give it now letter for letter :—</p>
   <p>But think that God ys ther he was .</p>
   <p>There is poetry too in the line , if I interpret it rightly as intending the gospel —</p>
   <p>The sonde that God sent al abowte .</p>
   <p>I shall now make a few extracts from poems of the same century whose authors are unknown .<span type="note_anchor">[ 51 ]</span>A good many such are extant . With regard to the similarity of those I choose , I would remark , that not only will the poems of the same period necessarily resemble each other , but , where the preservation of any has depended upon the choice and transcription of one person , these will in all probability resemble each other yet more . Here are a few verses from a hymn headed The Sweetness of Jesus :—</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">If I for kindness should love my kin , for natural reasons .</l>
     <l n="2">Then me thinketh in my thought [ Kind is nature ,</l>
     <l n="3">By kindly skill I should begin by natural judgment .</l>
     <l n="4">At him that hath me made of nought ;</l>
     <l n="5">His likeness he set my soul within ,</l>
     <l n="6">And all this world for me hath wrought ;</l>
     <l n="7">As father he fondid my love to win , set about .</l>
     <l n="8">For to heaven he hath me brought .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">Our brother and sister he is by skill , reason .</l>
     <l n="10">For he so said , and lerid us that lore , taught .</l>
     <l n="11">That whoso wrought his Father 's will ,</l>
     <l n="12">Brethren and sisters to him they wore . were .</l>
     <l n="13">My kind also he took ther-tille ; my nature also he took</l>
     <l n="14">Full truly trust I him therefore [ for that purpose .</l>
     <l n="15">That he will never let me spill , perish .</l>
     <l n="16">But with his mercy salve my sore .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">

     <l n="18">Well ought I , wretch , if I were kind — natural .</l>
     <l n="19">Night and day to work his will ,</l>
     <l n="20">And ever have that Lord in mind .</l>
     <l n="21">But ghostly foes grieve me ill , spiritual .</l>
     <l n="22">And my frail flesh maketh me blind ;</l>
     <l n="23">Therefore his mercy I take me till , betake me to .</l>
     <l n="24">For better bote can I none find . aid .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>In my choice of stanzas I have to keep in view some measure of completeness in the result . These poems , however , are mostly very loose in structure . This , while it renders choice easy , renders closeness of unity impossible .</p>
   <p>From a poem headed — again from the last line of each stanza — Be my comfort , Christ Jesus , I choose the following four , each possessing some remarkable flavour , tone , or single touch . Note the alliteration in the lovely line , beginning “ Bairn y-born . ” The whole of the stanza in which we find it , sounds so strangely fresh in the midst of its antiquated tones , that we can hardly help asking whether it can be only the quaintness of the expression that makes the feeling appear more real , or whether in very truth men were not in those days nearer in heart , as well as in time , to the marvel of the Nativity .</p>
   <p>In the next stanza , how oddly the writer forgets that Jesus himself was a Jew , when , embodying the detestation of Christian centuries in one line , he says ,</p>
   <p>And tormented with many a Jew !</p>
   <p>In the third stanza , I consider the middle quatrain , that is , the four lines beginning “ Out of this world , ” perfectly grand .</p>
   <p>The oddness of the last line but one of the fourth stanza is redeemed by the wonderful reality it gives to the faith of the speaker : “ See my sorrow , and say Ho ! ” stopping it as one would call after a man and stop him .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">

   <p>Of fourteen stanzas called Richard de Castre 's Prayer to Jesus , I choose five from the latter half , where the prayer passes from his own spiritual necessities , very tenderly embodied , to those of others . It does our hearts good to see the clouded sun of prayer for oneself break forth in the gladness of blessed entreaty for all men , for them that make Him angry , for saints in trouble , for the country torn by war , for the whole body of Christ and its unity .

   <p>We now approach the second revival of literature , preceded in England by the arrival of the art of printing ; after which we find ourselves walking in a morning twilight , knowing something of the authors as well as of their work .</p>
   <p>I have little more to offer from this century . There are a few religious poems by John Skelton , who was tutor to Henry VIII . But such poetry , though he was a clergyman , was not much in Skelton 's manner of mind . We have far better of a similar sort already .</p>
   <p>A new sort of dramatic representation had by this time greatly encroached upon the old Miracle Plays . The fresh growth was called Morals or Moral Plays . In them we see the losing victory of invention over the imagination that works with given facts . No doubt in the Moral Plays there is more exercise of intellect as well as of ingenuity ; for they consist of metaphysical facts turned into individual existences by personification , and their relations then dramatized by allegory . But their poetry is greatly inferior both in character and execution to that of the Miracles . They have a religious tendency , as everything moral must have , and sometimes they go even farther , as in one , for instance , called The Castle of Perseverance , in which we have all the cardinal virtues and all the cardinal sins contending for the possession of Humanum Genus , the Human Race being presented as a new-born child , who grows old and dies in the course of the play ; but it was a great stride in art when human nature and human history began again to be exemplified after a simple human fashion , in the story , that is , of real men and women , instead of by allegorical personifications of the analysed and abstracted constituents of them . Allegory has her place , and a lofty one , in literature ; but when her plants cover the garden and run to seed , Allegory herself is ashamed of her children : the loveliest among them are despised for the general obtrusiveness of the family . Imitation not only brings the thing imitated into disrepute , but tends to destroy what original faculty the imitator may have possessed .</p>
   <p>CHAPTER IV .</p>
   <p>INTRODUCTION TO THE ELIZABETHAN ERA .</p>
   <p>Poets now began to write more smoothly — not a great virtue , but indicative of a growing desire for finish , which , in any art , is a great virtue . No doubt smoothness is often confounded with , and mistaken for finish ; but you might have a mirror-like polish on the surface of a statue , for instance , and yet the marble be full of inanity , or vagueness , or even vulgarity of result — irrespective altogether of its idea . The influence of Italian poetry reviving once more in the country , roused such men as Wyat and Surrey to polish the sound of their verses ; but smoothness , I repeat , is not melody , and where the attention paid to the outside of the form results in flatness , and , still worse , in obscurity , as is the case with both of these poets , little is gained and much is lost .</p>
   <p>Each has paraphrased portions of Scripture , but with results of little value ; and there is nothing of a religious nature I care to quote from either , except these five lines from an epistle of Sir Thomas Wyat 's :</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Thyself content with that is thee assigned ,</l>
     <l n="2">And use it well that is to thee allotted ;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">Then seek no more out of thyself to find</l>
     <l n="4">The thing that thou hast sought so long before ,</l>
     <l n="5">For thou shalt feel it sticking in thy mind .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Students of versification will allow me to remark that Sir Thomas was the first English poet , so far as I know , who used the terza rima , Dante 's chief mode of rhyming : the above is too small a fragment to show that it belongs to a poem in that manner . It has never been popular in England , although to my mind it is the finest form of continuous rhyme in any language . Again , we owe his friend Surrey far more for being the first to write English blank verse , whether invented by himself or not , than for any matter he has left us in poetic shape .</p>
   <p>This period is somewhat barren of such poetry as we want . Here is a portion of the Fifty-first Psalm , translated amongst others into English verse by John Croke , Master in Chancery , in the reign of Henry VIII .</p>

   <p>In the works of George Gascoigne I find one poem fit for quoting here . He is not an interesting writer , and , although his verse is very good , there is little likelihood of its ever being read more than it is now . The date of his birth is unknown , but probably he was in his teens when Surrey was beheaded in the year 1547 . He is the only poet whose style reminds me of his , although the wherefore will hardly be evident from my quotation . It is equally flat , but more articulate . I need not detain my reader with remarks upon him . The fact is , I am glad to have something , if not “ a cart-load of wholesome instructions , ” to cast into this Slough of Despond , should it be only to see it vanish . The poem is called</p>

   <p>Lest this poem should appear to any one hardly religious enough for the purpose of this book , I would remark that it reminds me of what our Lord says about the true source of defilement : it is what is bred in the man that denies him . Our Lord himself taught a divine morality , which is as it were the body of love , and is as different from mere morality as « the living body is from the dead .</p>

   <p>The apprehensions of the wiser part of the nation have generally been ahead of its hopes . Every age is born with an ideal ; but instead of beholding that ideal in the future where it lies , it throws it into the past . Hence the lapse of the nation must appear tremendous , even when she is making her best progress .</p>
   <p>CHAPTER V .</p>
   <p>SPENSER AND HIS FRIENDS .</p>
   <p>We have now arrived at the period of English history in every way fullest of marvel — the period of Elizabeth . As in a northern summer the whole region bursts into blossom at once , so with the thought and feeling of England in this glorious era .</p>
   <p>The special development of the national mind with which we are now concerned , however , did not by any means arrive at its largest and clearest result until the following century . Still its progress is sufficiently remarkable . For , while everything that bore upon the mental development of the nation must bear upon its poetry , the fresh vigour given by the doctrines of the Reformation to the sense of personal responsibility , and of immediate relation to God , with the grand influences , both literary and spiritual , of the translated , printed , and studied Bible , operated more immediately upon its devotional utterance .</p>
   <p>Towards the close of the sixteenth century , we begin to find such verse as I shall now present to my readers . Only I must first make a few remarks upon the great poem of the period : I mean , of course , The Faerie Queen .</p>
   <p>I dare not begin to set forth after any fashion the profound religious truth contained in this poem ; for it would require a volume larger than this to set forth even that of the first book adequately . In this case it is well to remember that the beginning of comment , as well as of strife , is like the letting out of water .</p>
   <p>The direction in which the wonderful allegory of the latter moves may be gathered from the following stanza , the first of the eighth canto :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Ay me ! how many perils do enfold</l>
     <l n="2">The righteous man to make him daily fail ;</l>
     <l n="3">Were not that heavenly grace doth him uphold , it understood .</l>
     <l n="4">And steadfast Truth acquit him out of all !</l>
     <l n="5">Her love is firm , her care continual ,</l>
     <l n="6">So oft as he , through his own foolish pride</l>
     <l n="7">Or weakness , is to sinful bands made thrall :</l>
     <l n="8">Else should this Redcross Knight in bands have died ,</l>
     <l n="9">For whose deliverance she this Prince doth thither guide .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Nor do I judge it good to spend much of my space upon remarks personal to those who have not been especially writers of sacred verse . When we come to the masters of such song , we cannot speak of their words without speaking of themselves ; but when in the midst of many words those of the kind we seek are few , the life of the writer does not justify more than a passing notice here .</p>
   <p>We know but little of Spenser 's history : if we might know all , I do not fear that we should find anything to destroy the impression made by his verse — that he was a Christian gentleman , a noble and pure-minded man , of highest purposes and aims .</p>
   <p>His style is injured by the artistic falsehood of producing antique effects in the midst of modern feeling .<span type="note_anchor">[ 54 ]</span>It was scarcely more justifiable , for instance , in Spenser 's time than it would be in ours to use glitterand for glittering ; or to return to a large use of alliteration , three , four , sometimes even five words in the same line beginning with the same consonant sound . Everything should look like what it is : prose or verse should be written in the language of its own era . No doubt the wide-spreading roots of poetry gather to it more variety of expression than prose can employ ; and the very nature of verse will make it free of times and seasons , harmonizing many opposites . Hence , through its mediation , without discord , many fine old words , by the loss of which the language has grown poorer and feebler , might be honourably enticed to return even into our prose . But nothing ought to be brought back because it is old . That it is out of use is a presumptive argument that it ought to remain out of use : good reasons must be at hand to support its reappearance . I must not , however , enlarge upon this wide-reaching question ; for of the two portions of Spenser 's verse which I shall quote , one of them is not at all , the other not so much as his great poem , affected with this whim .</p>
   <p>The first I give is a sonnet , one of eighty-eight which he wrote to his wife before their marriage . Apparently disappointed in early youth , he did not fall in love again ,— at least there is no sign of it that I know ,— till he was middle-aged . But then — woman was never more grandly wooed than was his Elizabeth . I know of no marriage-present worthy to be compared with the Epithalamion which he gave her “ in lieu of many ornaments , ” — one of the most stately , melodious , and tender poems in the world , I fully believe .</p>
   <p>But now for the sonnet — the sixty-eighth of the Amoretti :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Most glorious Lord of Life ! that , on this day ,</l>
     <l n="2">Didst make thy triumph over death and sin ,</l>
     <l n="3">And having harrowed hell , didst bring away</l>
     <l n="4">Captivity thence captive , us to win :</l>
     <l n="5">This joyous day , dear Lord , with joy begin ;</l>
     <l n="6">And grant that we , for whom thou diddest die ,</l>
     <l n="7">Being with thy dear blood clean washed from sin ,</l>
     <l n="8">May live for ever in felicity !</l>
     <l n="9">And that thy love we weighing worthily ,</l>
     <l n="10">May likewise love thee for the same again ;</l>
     <l n="11">And for thy sake , that all like dear didst buy ,</l>
     <l n="12">With love may one another entertain .</l>
     <l n="13">So let us love , dear love , like as we ought :</l>
     <l n="14">Love is the lesson which the Lord us taught .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Those who have never felt the need of the divine , entering by the channel of will and choice and prayer , for the upholding , purifying , and glorifying of that which itself first created human , will consider this poem untrue , having its origin in religious affectation . Others will think otherwise .</p>
   <p>The greater part of what I shall next quote is tolerably known even to those who have made little study of our earlier literature , yet it may not be omitted here . It is from An Hymne of Heavenly Love , consisting of forty-one stanzas , written in what was called Rime Royal — a favourite with Milton , and , next to the Spenserian , in my opinion the finest of stanzas . Its construction will reveal itself . I take two stanzas from the beginning of the hymn , then one from the heart of it , and the rest from the close . It gives no feeling of an outburst of song , but rather of a brooding chant , most quiet in virtue of the depth of its thoughtfulness . Indeed , all his rhythm is like the melodies of water , and I could quote at least three passages in which he speaks of rhythmic movements and watery progressions together . His thoughts , and hence his words , flow like a full , peaceful stream , diffuse , with plenteousness unrestrained .</p>

   <p>There is a companion to the poem of which these verses are a portion , called An Hymne of Heavenly Beautie , filled like this , and like two others on Beauty and Love , with Platonic forms both of thought and expression ; but I have preferred quoting a longer part of the former to giving portions of both . My reader will recognize in the extract a fuller force of intellect brought to bear on duty ; although it would be unwise to take a mind like Spenser 's for a type of more than the highest class of the age . Doubtless the division in the country with regard to many of the Church 's doctrines had its part in bringing out and strengthening this tendency to reasoning which is so essential to progress . Where religion itself is not the most important thing with the individual , all reasoning upon it must indeed degenerate into strifes of words , vermiculate questions , as Lord Bacon calls them — such , namely , as like the hoarded manna reveal the character of the owner by breeding of worms — yet on no questions may the light of the candle of the Lord , that is , the human understanding , be cast with greater hope of discovery than on those of religion , those , namely , that bear upon man 's relation to God and to his fellow . The most partial illumination of this region , the very cause of whose mystery is the height and depth of its truth , is of more awful value to the human being than perfect knowledge , if such were possible , concerning everything else in the universe ; while , in fact , in this very region , discovery may bring with it a higher kind of conviction than can accompany the results of investigation in any other direction . In these grandest of all thinkings , the great men of this time showed a grandeur of thought worthy of their surpassing excellence in other noblest fields of human labour . They thought greatly because they aspired greatly .</p>
   <p>Sir Walter Raleigh was a personal friend of Edmund Spenser . They were almost of the same age , the former born in 1552 , the latter in the following year . A writer of magnificent prose , itself full of religion and poetry both in thought and expression , he has not distinguished himself greatly in verse . There is , however , one remarkable poem fit for my purpose , which I can hardly doubt to be his . It is called Sir Walter Raleigh 's Pilgrimage . The probability is that it was written just after his condemnation in 1603 — although many years passed before his sentence was carried into execution .</p>

   <p>This poem is a somewhat strange medley , with a confusion of figure , and a repeated failure in dignity , which is very far indeed from being worthy of Raleigh 's prose . But it is very remarkable how wretchedly some men will show , who , doing their own work well , attempt that for which practice has not — to use a word of the time — enabled them . There is real power in the poem , however , and the confusion is far more indicative of the pleased success of an unaccustomed hand than of incapacity for harmonious work . Some of the imagery , especially the “ crystal buckets , ” will suggest those grotesque drawings called Emblems , which were much in use before and after this period , and , indeed , were only a putting into visible shape of such metaphors and similes as some of the most popular poets of the time , especially Doctor Donne , indulged in ; while the profusion of earthly riches attributed to the heavenly paths and the places of repose on the journey , may well recall Raleigh 's own descriptions of South American glories . Englishmen of that era believed in an earthly Paradise beyond the Atlantic , the wonderful reports of whose magnificence had no doubt a share in lifting the imaginations and hopes of the people to the height at which they now stood .</p>
   <p>There may be an appearance of irreverence in the way in which he contrasts the bribeless Hall of Heaven with the proceedings at his own trial , where he was browbeaten , abused , and , from the very commencement , treated as a guilty man by Sir Edward Coke , the king 's attorney . He even puns with the words angels and fees . Burning from a sense of injustice , however , and with the solemnity of death before him , he could not be guilty of conscious irreverence , at least . But there is another remark I have to make with regard to the matter , which will bear upon much of the literature of the time : even the great writers of that period had such a delight in words , and such a command over them , that like their skilful horsemen , who enjoyed making their steeds show off the fantastic paces they had taught them , they played with the words as they passed through their hands , tossing them about as a juggler might his balls . But even herein the true master of speech showed his masterdom : his play must not be by-play ; it must contribute to the truth of the idea which was taking form in those words . We shall see this more plainly when we come to transcribe some of Sir Philip Sidney 's work . There is no irreverence in it . Nor can I take it as any sign of hardness that Raleigh should treat the visual image of his own anticipated death with so much coolness , if the writer of a little elegy on his execution , when Raleigh was fourteen years older than at the presumed date of the foregoing verses , describes him truly when he says :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">I saw in every stander-by</l>
     <l n="2">Pale death , life only in thy eye .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The following hymn is also attributed to Raleigh . If it has less brilliance of fancy , it has none of the faults of the preceding , and is far more artistic in construction and finish , notwithstanding a degree of irregularity .</p>

   </lg>
   <p>There are a few fine lines in the poem . The last two lines of the first stanza are admirable ; the last two of the second very weak . The last stanza is good throughout .</p>
   <p>But it would be very unfair to judge Sir Walter by his verse . His prose is infinitely better , and equally displays the devout tendency of his mind — a tendency common to all the great men of that age . The worst I know of him is the selfishly prudent advice he left behind for his son . No doubt he had his faults , but we must not judge a man even by what he says in an over-anxiety for the prosperity of his child .</p>
   <p>Another remarkable fact in the history of those great men is that they were all men of affairs . Raleigh was a soldier , a sailor , a discoverer , a politician , as well as an author . His friend Spenser was first secretary to Lord Grey when he was Governor of Ireland , and afterwards Sheriff of Cork . He has written a large treatise on the state of Ireland . But of all the men of the age no one was more variously gifted , or exercised those gifts in more differing directions , than the man who of them all was most in favour with queen , court , and people — Philip Sidney . I could write much to set forth the greatness , culture , balance , and scope of this wonderful man . Renowned over Europe for his person , for his dress , for his carriage , for his speech , for his skill in arms , for his horsemanship , for his soldiership , for his statesmanship , for his learning , he was beloved for his friendship , his generosity , his steadfastness , his simplicity , his conscientiousness , his religion . Amongst the lamentations over his death printed in Spenser 's works , there is one poem by Matthew Roydon , a few verses of which I shall quote , being no vain eulogy . Describing his personal appearance , he says :</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">A sweet , attractive kind of grace ,</l>
     <l n="2">A full assurance given by looks ,</l>
     <l n="3">Continual comfort in a face ,</l>
     <l n="4">The lineaments of Gospel books !—</l>
     <l n="5">I trow , that countenance cannot lie</l>
     <l n="6">Whose thoughts are legible in the eye .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="7">Was ever eye did see that face ,</l>
     <l n="8">Was ever ear did hear that tongue ,</l>
     <l n="9">Was ever mind did mind his grace</l>
     <l n="10">That ever thought the travel long ?</l>
     <l n="11">But eyes and ears , and every thought ,</l>
     <l n="12">Were with his sweet perfections caught .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>His Arcadia is a book full of wisdom and beauty . None of his writings were printed in his lifetime ; but the Arcadia was for many years after his death one of the most popular books in the country . His prose , as prose , is not equal to his friend Raleigh 's , being less condensed and stately . It is too full of fancy in thought and freak in rhetoric to find now-a-days more than a very limited number of readers ; and a good deal of the verse that is set in it , is obscure and uninteresting , partly from some false notions of poetic composition which he and his friend Spenser entertained when young ; but there is often an exquisite art in his other poems .</p>
   <p>The first I shall transcribe is a sonnet , to which the Latin words printed below it might be prefixed as a title : Splendidis longum valedico nugis .</p>
   <lg type="poem">

     <l n="1">Leave me , O love , which reachest but to dust ;</l>

     <l n="3">Grow rich in that which never taketh rust :</l>

     <l n="14">Eternal love , maintain thy life in me .</l>

   <p>Before turning to the treasury of his noblest verse , I shall give six lines from a poem in the Arcadia — chiefly for the sake of instancing what great questions those mighty men delighted in :</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">What essence destiny hath ; if fortune be or no ;</l>
     <l n="2">Whence our immortal souls to mortal earth do stow [ 64 ]:</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">What life it is , and how that all these lives do gather ,</l>
     <l n="4">With outward maker 's force , or like an inward father .</l>
     <l n="5">Such thoughts , me thought , I thought , and strained my single mind ,</l>
     <l n="6">Then void of nearer cares , the depth of things to find .</l>

   <p>Lord Bacon was not the only one , in such an age , to think upon the mighty relations of physics and metaphysics , or , as Sidney would say , “ of naturall and supernaturall philosophic . ” For a man to do his best , he must be upheld , even in his speculations , by those around him .</p>
   <p>In the specimen just given , we find that our religious poetry has gone down into the deeps . There are indications of such a tendency in the older times , but neither then were the questions so articulate , nor were the questioners so troubled for an answer . The alternative expressed in the middle couplet seems to me the most imperative of all questions — both for the individual and for the church : Is man fashioned by the hands of God , as a potter fashioneth his vessel ; or do we indeed come forth from his heart ? Is power or love the making might of the universe ? He who answers this question aright possesses the key to all righteous questions .</p>
   <p>Sir Philip and his sister Mary , Countess of Pembroke , made between them a metrical translation of the Psalms of David . It cannot be determined which are hers and which are his ; but if I may conclude anything from a poem by the sister , to which I shall by and by refer , I take those I now give for the brother 's work .</p>

   <p>The first stanza seems to me very fine , especially the verse , “ Return possessed of what they pray thee . ” The third stanza might have been written after the Spanish Philip 's Armada , but both King David and Sir Philip Sidney were dead before God brake that archer 's bow .<span type="note_anchor">[ 66 ]</span>The fourth line of the next stanza is a noteworthy instance of the sense gathering to itself the sound , and is in lovely contrast with the closing line of the same stanza .</p>
   <p>One of the most remarkable specimens I know of the play with words of which I have already spoken as common even in the serious writings of this century , is to be found in the next line : “ Where earth doth end with endless ending . ” David , regarding the world as a flat disc , speaks of the ends of the earth : Sidney , knowing it to be a globe , uses the word of the Psalmist , but re-moulds and changes the form of it , with a power fantastic , almost capricious in its wilfulness , yet causing it to express the fact with a marvel of precision . We see that the earth ends ; we cannot reach the end we see ; therefore the “ earth doth end with endless ending . ” It is a case of that contradiction in the form of the words used , which brings out a truth in another plane as it were ;— a paradox in words , not in meaning , for the words can bear no meaning but the one which reveals its own reality .</p>
   <p>The following little psalm , The Lord reigneth , is a thunderous organ-blast of praise . The repetition of words in the beginning of the second stanza produces a remarkably fine effect .</p>

   <p>They were a wonderful family those Sidneys . Mary , for whom Philip wrote his chief work , thence called “ The Countess of Pembroke 's Arcadia , ” was a woman of rare gifts . The chief poem known to be hers is called Our Saviour 's Passion . It is full of the faults of the age . Sir Philip 's sport with words is so graceful and ordered as to subserve the utterance of the thought : his sister 's fanciful convolutions appear to be there for their own sake — certainly are there to the obscuration of the sense . The difficulty of the poem arises in part , I believe , from corruption , but chiefly from a certain fantastic way of dealing with thought as well as word of which I shall have occasion to say more when we descend a little further . It is , in the main , a lamentation over our Saviour 's sufferings , in which the countess is largely guilty of the very feminine fault of seeking to convey the intensity of her emotions by forcing words , accumulating forms , and exaggerating descriptions . This may indeed convince as to the presence of feeling , but cannot communicate the feeling itself . The right word will at once generate a sympathy of which all agonies of utterance will only render the willing mind more and more incapable .</p>
   <p>The poem is likewise very diffuse — again a common fault with women of power ; for indeed the faculty of compressing thought into crystalline form is one of the rarest gifts of artistic genius . It consists of a hundred and ten stanzas , from which I shall gather and arrange a few .</p>

   <p>Had all the poem been like these stanzas , I should not have spoken so strongly concerning its faults . There are a few more such in it . It closes with a very fantastic use of musical terms , following upon a curious category of the works of nature as praising God , to which I refer for the sake of one stanza , or rather of one line in the stanza :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">To see the greyhound course , the hound in chase ,</l>
     <l n="2">Whilst little dormouse sleepeth out her eyne ;</l>
     <l n="3">The lambs and rabbits sweetly run at base ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 68 ]</span></l>
     <l n="4">Whilst highest trees the little squirrels climb ,</l>
     <l n="5">The crawling worms out creeping in the showers ,</l>
     <l n="6">And how the snails do climb the lofty towers .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>What a love of animated nature there is in the lovely lady ! I am all but confident , however , that second line came to her from watching her children asleep . She had one child at least : that William Herbert , who is generally , and with weight , believed the W. H . of Shakspere 's Sonnets , a grander honour than the earldom of Pembroke , or even the having Philip Sidney to his uncle : I will not say grander than having Mary Sidney to his mother .</p>
   <p>Let me now turn to Sidney 's friend , Sir Fulk Grevill , Lord Brooke , who afterwards wrote his life , “ as an intended preface ” to all his “ Monuments to the memory of Sir Philip Sidney , ” the said monuments being Lord Brooke 's own poems .</p>
   <p>My extract is from A Treatise of Religion , in which , if the reader do not find much of poetic form , he will find at least some grand spiritual philosophy , the stuff whereof all highest poetry is fashioned . It is one of the first poems in which the philosophy of religion , and not either its doctrine , feeling , or history , predominates . It is , as a whole , poor , chiefly from its being so loosely written . There are men , and men whose thoughts are of great worth , to whom it never seems to occur that they may utter very largely and convey very little ; that what is clear to themselves is in their speech obscure as a late twilight . Their utterance is rarely articulate : their spiritual mouth talks with but half-movements of its lips ; it does not model their thoughts into clear-cut shapes , such as the spiritual ear can distinguish as they enter it . Of such is Lord Brooke . These few stanzas , however , my readers will be glad to have :</p>

   <p>If a fair proportion of it were equal to this , the poem would be a fine one , not for its poetry , but for its spiritual metaphysics . I think the fourth and fifth of the stanzas I have given , profound in truth , and excellent in utterance . They are worth pondering .</p>
   <p>We now descend a decade of the century , to find another group of names within the immediate threshold of the sixties .</p>

    <head>CHAPTER VI .</head>
    <head>LORD BACON AND HIS COEVALS .</head>
    <head>Except it be Milton 's , there is not any prose fuller of grand poetic embodiments than Lord Bacon 's . Yet he always writes contemptuously of poetry , having in his eye no doubt the commonplace kinds of it , which will always occupy more bulk , and hence be more obtrusive , than that which is true in its nature and rare in its workmanship . Towards the latter end of his life , however , being in ill health at the time , he translated seven of the Psalms of David into verse , dedicating them to George Herbert . The best of them is Psalm civ .— just the one upon which we might suppose , from his love to the laws of Nature , he would dwell with the greatest sympathy . Partly from the wish to hear his voice amongst the rest of our singers , partly for the merits of the version itself , which has some remarkable lines , I have resolved to include it here . It is the first specimen I have given in the heroic couplet .</head>
     <l n="1">Father and King of Powers both high and low ,</l>
     <l n="2">Whose sounding fame all creatures serve to blow ;</l>
     <l n="3">My soul shall with the rest strike up thy praise ,</l>
     <l n="4">And carol of thy works , and wondrous ways .</l>
     <l n="5">But who can blaze thy beauties , Lord , aright ?</l>
     <l n="6">They turn the brittle beams of mortal sight .</l>
     <l n="7">Upon thy head thou wear'st a glorious crown ,</l>
     <l n="8">All set with virtues , polished with renown :</l>
     <l n="9">Thence round about a silver veil doth fall</l>
     <l n="10">Of crystal light , mother of colours all .</l>
     <l n="11">The compass , heaven , smooth without grain or fold ,</l>
     <l n="12">All set with spangs of glittering stars untold ,</l>
     <l n="13">And striped with golden beams of power unpent ,</l>
     <l n="14">Is raiséd up for a removing tent</l>
     <l n="15">Vaulted and archéd are his chamber beams</l>
     <l n="16">Upon the seas , the waters , and the streams ;</l>
     <l n="17">The clouds as chariots swift do scour the sky ;</l>
     <l n="18">The stormy winds upon their wings do fly</l>
     <l n="19">His angels spirits are , that wait his will ;</l>
     <l n="20">As flames of fire his anger they fulfil .</l>
     <l n="21">In the beginning , with a mighty hand ,</l>
     <l n="22">He made the earth by counterpoise to stand ,</l>
     <l n="23">Never to move , but to be fixed still ;</l>
     <l n="24">Yet hath no pillars but his sacred will .</l>
     <l n="25">This earth , as with a veil , once covered was ;</l>
     <l n="26">The waters overflowéd all the mass ;</l>
     <l n="27">But upon his rebuke away they fled ,</l>
     <l n="28">And then the hills began to show their head ;</l>
     <l n="29">The vales their hollow bosoms opened plain ,</l>
     <l n="30">The streams ran trembling down the vales again ;</l>
     <l n="31">And that the earth no more might drowned be ,</l>
     <l n="32">He set the sea his bounds of liberty ;</l>
     <l n="33">And though his waves resound and beat the shore ,</l>
     <l n="34">Yet it is bridled by his holy lore .</l>
     <l n="35">Then did the rivers seek their proper places ,</l>
     <l n="36">And found their heads , their issues , and their races ;</l>
     <l n="37">The springs do feed the rivers all the way ,</l>
     <l n="38">And so the tribute to the sea repay :</l>
     <l n="39">Running along through many a pleasant field ,</l>
     <l n="40">Much fruitfulness unto the earth they yield ;</l>
     <l n="41">That know the beasts and cattle feeding by ,</l>
     <l n="42">Which for to slake their thirst do thither hie .</l>
     <l n="43">Nay , desert grounds the streams do not forsake ,</l>
     <l n="44">But through the unknown ways their journey take ;</l>
     <l n="45">The asses wild that hide in wilderness ,</l>
     <l n="46">Do thither come , their thirst for to refresh .</l>
     <l n="47">The shady trees along their banks do spring ,</l>
     <l n="48">In which the birds do build , and sit , and sing ,</l>
     <l n="49">Stroking the gentle air with pleasant notes ,</l>
     <l n="50">Plaining or chirping through their warbling throats .</l>
     <l n="51">The higher grounds , where waters cannot rise ,</l>
     <l n="52">By rain and dews are watered from the skies ,</l>
     <l n="53">Causing the earth put forth the grass for beasts ,</l>
     <l n="54">And garden-herbs , served at the greatest feasts ,</l>
     <l n="55">And bread that is all viands ’ firmament ,</l>
     <l n="56">And gives a firm and solid nourishment ;</l>
     <l n="57">And wine man 's spirits for to recreate ,</l>
     <l n="58">And oil his face for to exhilarate .</l>
     <l n="59">The sappy cedars , tall like stately towers ,</l>
     <l n="60">High flying birds do harbour in their bowers ;</l>
     <l n="61">The holy storks that are the travellers ,</l>
     <l n="62">Choose for to dwell and build within the firs ;</l>
     <l n="63">The climbing goats hang on steep mountains ’ side ;</l>
     <l n="64">The digging conies in the rocks do bide .</l>
     <l n="65">The moon , so constant in inconstancy ,</l>
     <l n="66">Doth rule the monthly seasons orderly ;</l>
     <l n="67">The sun , eye of the world , doth know his race ,</l>
     <l n="68">And when to show , and when to hide his face .</l>
     <l n="69">Thou makest darkness , that it may be night ,</l>
     <l n="70">Whenas the savage beasts that fly the light ,</l>
     <l n="71">As conscious of man 's hatred , leave their den ,</l>
     <l n="72">And range abroad , secured from sight of men .</l>
     <l n="73">Then do the forests ring of lions roaring ,</l>
     <l n="74">That ask their meat of God , their strength restoring ;</l>
     <l n="75">But when the day appears , they back do fly ,</l>
     <l n="76">And in their dens again do lurking lie ;</l>
     <l n="77">Then man goes forth to labour in the field ,</l>
     <l n="78">Whereby his grounds more rich increase may yield .</l>
     <l n="79">O Lord , thy providence sufficeth all ;</l>
     <l n="80">Thy goodness not restrained but general</l>
     <l n="81">Over thy creatures , the whole earth doth flow</l>
     <l n="82">With thy great largeness poured forth here below .</l>
     <l n="83">Nor is it earth alone exalts thy name ,</l>
     <l n="84">But seas and streams likewise do spread the same .</l>
     <l n="85">The rolling seas unto the lot do fall</l>
     <l n="86">Of beasts innumerable , great and small ;</l>
     <l n="87">There do the stately ships plough up the floods ;</l>
     <l n="88">The greater navies look like walking woods ;</l>
     <l n="89">The fishes there far voyages do make ,</l>
     <l n="90">To divers shores their journey they do take ;</l>
     <l n="91">There hast thou set the great leviathan ,</l>
     <l n="92">That makes the seas to seethe like boiling pan :</l>
     <l n="93">All these do ask of thee their meat to live ,</l>
     <l n="94">Which in due season thou to them dost give :</l>
     <l n="95">Ope thou thy hand , and then they have good fare ;</l>
     <l n="96">Shut thou thy hand , and then they troubled are .</l>
     <l n="97">All life and spirit from thy breath proceed ,</l>
     <l n="98">Thy word doth all things generate and feed :</l>
     <l n="99">If thou withdraw'st it , then they cease to be ,</l>
     <l n="100">And straight return to dust and vanity ;</l>
     <l n="101">But when thy breath thou dost send forth again ,</l>
     <l n="102">Then all things do renew , and spring amain ,</l>
     <l n="103">So that the earth but lately desolate</l>
     <l n="104">Doth now return unto the former state .</l>
     <l n="105">The glorious majesty of God above</l>
     <l n="106">Shall ever reign , in mercy and in love ;</l>
     <l n="107">God shall rejoice all his fair works to see ,</l>
     <l n="108">For , as they come from him , all perfect be .</l>
     <l n="109">The earth shall quake , if aught his wrath provoke ;</l>
     <l n="110">Let him but touch the mountains , they shall smoke .</l>
     <l n="111">As long as life doth last , I hymns will sing ,</l>
     <l n="112">With cheerful voice , to the Eternal King ;</l>
     <l n="113">As long as I have being , I will praise</l>
     <l n="114">The works of God , and all his wondrous ways .</l>
     <l n="115">I know that he my words will not despise :</l>
     <l n="116">Thanksgiving is to him a sacrifice .</l>
     <l n="117">But as for sinners , they shall be destroyed</l>
     <l n="118">From off the earth — their places shall be void .</l>
     <l n="119">Let all his works praise him with one accord !</l>
     <l n="120">Oh praise the Lord , my soul ! Praise ye the Lord !</l>

   <p>His Hundred and Forty-ninth Psalm is likewise good ; but I have given enough of Lord Bacon 's verse , and proceed to call up one who was a poet indeed , although little known as such , being a Roman Catholic , a Jesuit even , and therefore , in Elizabeth 's reign , a traitor , and subject to the penalties according . Robert Southwell , “ thirteen times most cruelly tortured , ” could “ not be induced to confess anything , not even the colour of the horse whereon on a certain day he rode , lest from such indication his adversaries might conjecture in what house , or in company of what Catholics , he that day was . ” I quote these words of Lord Burleigh , lest any of my readers , discovering weakness in his verse , should attribute weakness to the man himself .</p>
   <p>It was no doubt on political grounds that these tortures , and the death that followed them , were inflicted . But it was for the truth as he saw it , that is , for the sake of duty , that Southwell thus endured . We must not impute all the evils of a system to every individual who holds by it . It may be found that a man has , for the sole sake of self-abnegation , yielded homage , where , if his object had been personal aggrandizement , he might have wielded authority . Southwell , if that which comes from within a man may be taken as the test of his character , was a devout and humble Christian . In the choir of our singers we only ask : “ Dost thou lift up thine heart ? ” Southwell 's song answers for him : “ I lift it up unto the Lord . ”</p>
   <p>His chief poem is called St. Peter 's Complaint . It is of considerable length — a hundred and thirty-two stanzas . It reminds us of the Countess of Pembroke 's poem , but is far more articulate and far superior in versification . Perhaps its chief fault is that the pauses are so measured with the lines as to make every line almost a sentence , the effect of which is a considerable degree of monotony . Like all writers of the time , he is , of course , fond of antithesis , and abounds in conceits and fancies ; whence he attributes a multitude of expressions to St. Peter of which never possibly could the substantial ideas have entered the Apostle 's mind , or probably any other than Southwell 's own . There is also a good deal of sentimentalism in the poem , a fault from which I fear modern Catholic verse is rarely free . Probably the Italian poetry with which he must have been familiar in his youth , during his residence in Rome , accustomed him to such irreverences of expression as this sentimentalism gives occasion to , and which are very far from indicating a correspondent state of feeling . Sentiment is a poor ape of love ; but the love is true notwithstanding . Here are a few stanzas from St. Peter 's Complaint :</p>

   <p>The following poem , in style almost as simple as a ballad , is at once of the quaintest and truest . Common minds , which must always associate a certain conventional respectability with the forms of religion , will think it irreverent . I judge its reverence profound , and such none the less that it is pervaded by a sweet and delicate tone of holy humour . The very title has a glimmer of the glowing heart of Christianity :</p>

   <p>There is just one stanza in a poem of Daniel , who belongs by birth to this group , which I should like to print by itself , if it were only for the love Coleridge had to the last two lines of it . It needs little stretch of scheme to let it show itself amongst religious poems . It occurs in a fine epistle to the Countess of Cumberland . Daniel 's writing is full of the practical wisdom of the inner life , and the stanza which I quote has a certain Wordsworthian flavour about it . It will not make a complete sentence , but must yet stand by itself :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Knowing the heart of man is set to be</l>
     <l n="2">The centre of this world , about the which</l>
     <l n="3">These revolutions of disturbances</l>
     <l n="4">Still roll ; where all th ’ aspects of misery</l>
     <l n="5">Predominate ; whose strong effects are such</l>
     <l n="6">As he must bear , being powerless to redress ;</l>
     <l n="7">And that unless above himself he can</l>
     <l n="8">Erect himself , how poor a thing is man !</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Later in the decade , comes Sir Henry Wotton . It will be seen that I have arranged my singers with reference to their birth , not to the point of time at which this or that poem was written or published . The poetic influences which work on the shaping fantasy are chiefly felt in youth , and hence the predominant mode of a poet 's utterance will be determined by what and where and amongst whom he was during that season . The kinds of the various poems will therefore probably fall into natural sequence rather after the dates of the youth of the writers than after the years in which they were written .</p>
   <p>Wotton was better known in his day as a politician than as a poet , and chiefly in ours as the subject of one of Izaak Walton 's biographies . Something of artistic instinct , rather than finish , is evident in his verses . Here is the best and the best-known of the few poems recognized as his :</p>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>THE CHARACTER OF A HAPPY LIFE .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">How happy is he born and taught ,</l>
     <l n="2">That serveth not another 's will ;</l>
     <l n="3">Whose armour is his honest thought ,</l>
     <l n="4">And silly truth his highest skill ;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">Whose passions not his masters are ;</l>
     <l n="6">Whose soul is still prepared for death ,</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">Who hath his life from humours freed ;</l>
     <l n="10">Whose conscience is his strong retreat ;</l>
     <l n="11">Whose state can neither flatterers feed ,</l>
     <l n="12">Nor ruin make accusers great ;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">Who envieth none whom chance doth raise</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="17">Who God doth late and early pray</l>
     <l n="18">More of his grace than gifts to lend ;</l>
     <l n="19">And entertains the harmless day</l>
     <l n="20">With a well-chosen book or friend .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="21">This man is free from servile bands</l>
     <l n="22">Of hope to rise , or fear to fall :</l>

   <p>Some of my readers will observe that in many places I have given a reading different from that in the best-known copy of the poem . I have followed a manuscript in the handwriting of Ben Jonson .<span type="note_anchor">[ 70 ]</span>I cannot tell whether Jonson has put the master 's hand to the amateur 's work , but in every case I find his reading the best .</p>
   <p>Sir John Davies must have been about fifteen years younger than Sir Fulk Grevill . He was born in 1570 , was bred a barrister , and rose to high position through the favour of James I .— gained , it is said , by the poem which the author called Nosce Teipsum ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 71 ]</span>but which is generally entitled On the Immortality of the Soul , intending by immortality the spiritual nature of the soul , resulting in continuity of existence . It is a wonderful instance of what can be done for metaphysics in verse , and by means of imagination or poetic embodiment generally . Argumentation cannot of course naturally belong to the region of poetry , however well it may comport itself when there naturalized ; and consequently , although there are most poetic no less than profound passages in the treatise , a light scruple arises whether its constituent matter can properly be called poetry . At all events , however , certain of the more prosaic measures and stanzas lend themselves readily , and with much favour , to some of the more complex of logical necessities . And it must be remembered that in human speech , as in the human mind , there are no absolute divisions : power shades off into feeling ; and the driest logic may find the heroic couplet render it good service .</p>
   <p>Sir John Davies 's treatise is not only far more poetic in image and utterance than that of Lord Brooke , but is far more clear in argument and firm in expression as well . Here is a fine invocation :</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">O Light , which mak'st the light which makes the day !</l>
     <l n="2">Which sett'st the eye without , and mind within ;</l>
     <l n="3">Lighten my spirit with one clear heavenly ray ,</l>
     <l n="4">Which now to view itself doth first begin .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">Thou , like the sun , dost , with an equal ray ,</l>
     <l n="6">Into the palace and the cottage shine ;</l>
     <l n="7">And show'st the soul both to the clerk and lay , learned and</l>
     <l n="8">By the clear lamp of th ’ oracle divine . [ unlearned</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>He is puzzled enough to get the theology of his time into harmony with his philosophy , and I cannot say that he is always triumphant in the attempt ; but here at least is good argument in justification of the freedom of man to sin .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">If by His word he had the current stayed</l>
     <l n="2">Of Adam 's will , which was by nature free ,</l>

     <l n="4">“ I will henceforth that Man no Man shall be . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">For what is Man without a moving mind ,</l>

     <l n="8">Her motions then would cease , and stand all still .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">So that if Man would be unvariable ,</l>
     <l n="10">He must be God , or like a rock or tree ;</l>

     <l n="12">But had a fall more desperate than we .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">The poem contains much excellent argument in mental science as well as in</l>
     <l n="14">religion and metaphysics ; but with that department I have nothing to do .</l>

   </lg>
   <p>I shall now give an outlook from the highest peak of the poem — to any who are willing to take the trouble necessary for seeing what another would show them .</p>
   <p>The section from which I have gathered the following stanzas is devoted to the more immediate proof of the soul 's immortality .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Her only end is never-ending bliss ,</l>
     <l n="2">Which is the eternal face of God to see ,</l>

     <l n="4">And to do this , she must eternal be .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">Again , how can she but immortal be ,</l>

     <l n="9">Water in conduit-pipes can rise no higher</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">At first her mother-earth she holdeth dear ,</l>

   <p>In looking back over our path from the point we have now reached , the first thought that suggests itself is — How much the reflective has supplanted the emotional ! I do not mean for a moment that the earliest poems were without thought , or that the latest are without emotion ; but in the former there is more of the skin , as it were — in the latter , more of the bones of worship ; not that in the one the worship is but skin-deep , or that in the other the bones are dry .</p>
   <p>To look at the change a little more closely : we find in the earliest time , feeling working on historic fact and on what was received as such , and the result simple aspiration after goodness . The next stage is good doctrine — I use the word , as St. Paul uses it , for instruction in righteousness — chiefly by means of allegory , all attempts at analysis being made through personification of qualities . Here the general form is frequently more poetic than the matter . After this we have a period principally of imitation , sometimes good , sometimes indifferent . Next , with the Reformation and the revival of literature together , come more of art and more of philosophy , to the detriment of the lyrical expression . People cannot think and sing : they can only feel and sing . But the philosophy goes farther in this direction , even to the putting in abeyance of that from which song takes its rise ,— namely , feeling itself . As to the former , amongst the verse of the period I have given , there is hardly anything to be called song but Sir Philip Sidney 's Psalms , and for them we are more indebted to King David than to Sir Philip . As to the latter , even in the case of that most mournful poem of the Countess of Pembroke , it is , to quite an unhealthy degree , occupied with the attempt to work upon her own feelings by the contemplation of them , instead of with the utterance of those aroused by the contemplation of truth . In her case the metaphysics have begun to prey upon and consume the emotions . Besides , that age was essentially a dramatic age , as even its command of language , especially as shown in the pranks it plays with it , would almost indicate ; and the dramatic impulse is less favourable , though not at all opposed , to lyrical utterance . In the cases of Sir Fulk Grevill and Sir John Davies , the feeling is assuredly profound ; but in form and expression the philosophy has quite the upper hand .</p>
   <p>We must not therefore suppose , however , that the cause of religious poetry has been a losing one . The last wave must sink that the next may rise , and the whole tide flow shorewards . The man must awake through all his soul , all his strength , all his mind , that he may worship God in unity , in the one harmonious utterance of his being : his heart must be united to fear his name . And for this final perfection of the individual the race must awake . At this season and that season , this power or that power must be chiefly developed in her elect ; and for its sake the growth of others must for a season be delayed . But the next generation will inherit all that has gone before ; and its elect , if they be themselves pure in heart , and individual , that is original , in mind , will , more or less thoroughly , embody the result , in subservience to some new development , essential in its turn to further progress . Even the fallow times , which we are so ready to call barren , must have their share in working the one needful work . They may be to the nation that which sickness so often is to the man — a time of refreshing from the Lord . A nation 's life does not lie in its utterance any more than in the things which it possesses : it lies in its action . The utterance is a result , and therefore a sign , of life ; but there may be life without any such sign . To do justice , to love mercy , to walk humbly with God , is the highest life of a nation as of an individual ; and when the time for speech comes , it will be such life alone that causes the speech to be strong at once and harmonious . When at last there are not ten righteous men in Sodom , Sodom can neither think , act , nor say , and her destruction is at hand .</p>
   <p>While the wave of the dramatic was sinking , the wave of the lyric was growing in force and rising in height . Especially as regards religious poetry we are as yet only approaching the lyrical jubilee . Fact and faith , self-consciousness and metaphysics , all are needful to the lyric of love . Modesty and art find their grandest , simplest labour in rightly subordinating each of those to the others . How could we have a George Herbert without metaphysics ? In those poems I have just given , the way of metaphysics was prepared for him . That which overcolours one age to the injury of its harmony , will , in the next or the next , fall into its own place in the seven-chorded rainbow of truth .</p>
   <p>CHAPTER VII .</p>
   <p>DR. DONNE .</p>
   <p>We now come to Dr. John Donne , a man of justly great respect and authority , who , born in the year 1573 , the fifteenth of Queen Elizabeth , died Dean of St. Paul 's in the year 1636 . But , although even Ben Jonson addresses him as “ the delight of Phoebus and each Muse , ” we are too far beyond the power of his social presence and the influence of his public utterances to feel that admiration of his poems which was so largely expressed during his lifetime . Of many of those that were written in his youth , Izaak Walton says Dr. Donne “ wished that his own eyes had witnessed their funerals . ” Faulty as they are , however , they are not the less the work of a great and earnest man .</p>
   <p>Bred to the law , but never having practised it , he lost his secretaryship to the Lord Chancellor Ellesmere through the revenge of Sir George More , whose daughter Donne had married in secret because of her father 's opposition . Dependent thereafter for years on the generous kindness of unrelated friends , he yet for conscience ’ sake refused to take orders when a good living was offered him ; and it was only after prolonged thought that he yielded to the importunity of King James , who was so convinced of his surpassing fitness for the church that he would speed him towards no other goal . When at length he dared hope that God might have called him to the high office , never man gave himself to its duties with more of whole-heartedness and devotion , and none have proved themselves more clean of the sacrilege of serving at the altar for the sake of the things offered thereon .</p>
   <p>He is represented by Dr. Johnson as one of the chief examples of that school of poets called by himself the metaphysical , an epithet which , as a definition , is almost false . True it is that Donne and his followers were always ready to deal with metaphysical subjects , but it was from their mode , and not their subjects , that Dr. Johnson classed them . What this mode was we shall see presently , for I shall be justified in setting forth its strangeness , even absurdity , by the fact that Dr. Donne was the dear friend of George Herbert , and had much to do with the formation of his poetic habits . Just twenty years older than Herbert , and the valued and intimate friend of his mother , Donne was in precisely that relation of age and circumstance to influence the other in the highest degree .</p>
   <p>The central thought of Dr. Donne is nearly sure to be just : the subordinate thoughts by means of which he unfolds it are often grotesque , and so wildly associated as to remind one of the lawlessness of a dream , wherein mere suggestion without choice or fitness rules the sequence . As some of the writers of whom I have last spoken would play with words , Dr. Donne would sport with ideas , and with the visual images or embodiments of them . Certainly in his case much knowledge reveals itself in the association of his ideas , and great facility in the management and utterance of them . True likewise , he says nothing unrelated to the main idea of the poem ; but not the less certainly does the whole resemble the speech of a child of active imagination , to whom judgment as to the character of his suggestions is impossible , his taste being equally gratified with a lovely image and a brilliant absurdity : a butterfly and a shining potsherd are to him similarly desirable . Whatever wild thing starts from the thicket of thought , all is worthy game to the hunting intellect of Dr. Donne , and is followed without question of tone , keeping , or harmony . In his play with words , Sir Philip Sidney kept good heed that even that should serve the end in view ; in his play with ideas , Dr. John Donne , so far from serving the end , sometimes obscures it almost hopelessly : the hart escapes while he follows the squirrels and weasels and bats . It is not surprising that , their author being so inartistic with regard to their object , his verses themselves should be harsh and unmusical beyond the worst that one would imagine fit to be called verse . He enjoys the unenviable distinction of having no rival in ruggedness of metric movement and associated sounds . This is clearly the result of indifference ; an indifference , however , which grows very strange to us when we find that he can write a lovely verse and even an exquisite stanza .</p>
   <p>Greatly for its own sake , partly for the sake of illustration , I quote a poem containing at once his best and his worst , the result being such an incongruity that we wonder whether it might not be called his best and his worst , because we cannot determine which . He calls it Hymn to God , my God , in my Sickness . The first stanza is worthy of George Herbert in his best mood .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Since I am coming to that holy room ,</l>
     <l n="2">Where with the choir of saints for evermore</l>
     <l n="3">I shall be made thy music , as I come</l>
     <l n="4">I tune the instrument here at the door ,</l>
     <l n="5">And what I must do then , think here before .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>To recognize its beauty , leaving aside the depth and truth of the phrase , “ Where I shall be made thy music , ” we must recall the custom of those days to send out for “ a noise of musicians . ” Hence he imagines that he has been summoned as one of a band already gone in to play before the king of “ The High Countries : ” he is now at the door , where he is listening to catch the tone , that he may have his instrument tuned and ready before he enters . But with what a jar the next stanza breaks on heart , mind , and ear !</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Whilst my physicians by their love are grown</l>
     <l n="2">Cosmographers , and I<span type="note_anchor">[ 72 ]</span>their map , who lie</l>
     <l n="3">Flat on this bed , that by them may be shown</l>
     <l n="4">That this is my south-west discovery ,</l>
     <l n="5">Per fretum febris — by these straits to die ;—</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Here , in the midst of comparing himself to a map , and his physicians to cosmographers consulting the map , he changes without warning into a navigator whom they are trying to follow upon the map as he passes through certain straits — namely , those of the fever — towards his south-west discovery , Death . Grotesque as this is , the absurdity deepens in the end of the next stanza by a return to the former idea . He is alternately a map and a man sailing on the map of himself . But the first half of the stanza is lovely : my reader must remember that the region of the West was at that time the Land of Promise to England .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">I joy that in these straits I see my West ;</l>
     <l n="2">For though those currents yield return to none ,</l>
     <l n="3">What shall my West hurt me ? As west and east</l>
     <l n="4">In all flat maps ( and I am one ) are one ,</l>
     <l n="5">So death doth touch the resurrection .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>It is hardly worth while , except for the strangeness of the phenomenon , to spend any time in elucidating this . Once more a map , he is that of the two hemispheres , in which the east of the one touches the west of the other . Could anything be much more unmusical than the line , “ In all flat maps ( and I am one ) are one ” ? But the next stanza is worse .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Is the Pacific sea my home ? Or are</l>
     <l n="2">The eastern riches ? Is Jerusalem ?</l>
     <l n="3">Anvan , and Magellan , and Gibraltar ?</l>
     <l n="4">All straits , and none but straits are ways to them ,</l>
     <l n="5">Whether where Japhet dwelt , or Cham , or Sem .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The meaning of the stanza is this : there is no earthly home : all these places are only straits that lead home , just as they themselves cannot be reached but through straits .</p>
   <p>Let my reader now forget all but the first stanza , and take it along with the following , the last two :</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">We think that Paradise and Calvary ,</l>
     <l n="2">Christ 's cross and Adam 's tree , stood in one place :</l>
     <l n="3">Look , Lord , and find both Adams met in me ;</l>
     <l n="4">As the first Adam 's sweat surrounds my face ,</l>
     <l n="5">May the last Adam 's blood my soul embrace .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="6">So , in his purple wrapped , receive me , Lord ;</l>
     <l n="7">By these his thorns give me his other crown ;</l>
     <l n="8">And as to others ’ souls I preached thy word ,</l>
     <l n="9">Be this my text , my sermon to mine own :</l>
     <l n="10">Therefore , that he may raise , the Lord throws down .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Surely these are very fine , especially the middle verse of the former and the first verse of the latter stanza . The three stanzas together make us lovingly regret that Dr. Donne should have ridden his Pegasus over quarry and housetop , instead of teaching him his paces .</p>
   <p>The next I quote is artistic throughout . Perhaps the fact , of which we are informed by Izaak Walton , “ that he caused it to be set to a grave and solemn tune , and to be often sung to the organ by the choristers of St. Paul 's church in his own hearing , especially at the evening service , ” may have something to do with its degree of perfection . There is no sign of his usual haste about it . It is even elaborately rhymed after Norman fashion , the rhymes in each stanza being consonant with the rhymes in every stanza .</p>
   <lg type="poem">

     <l n="17">And having done that , thou hast done :</l>
     <l n="18">I fear no more .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>In those days even a pun might be a serious thing : witness the play in the last stanza on the words son and sun — not a mere pun , for the Son of the Father is the Sun of Righteousness : he is Life and Light .</p>
   <p>What the Doctor himself says concerning the hymn , appears to me not only interesting but of practical value . He “ did occasionally say to a friend , ‘ The words of this hymn have restored to me the same thoughts of joy that possessed my soul in my sickness , when I composed it . ’ ” What a help it would be to many , if in their more gloomy times they would but recall the visions of truth they had , and were assured of , in better moments !</p>
   <p>Here is a somewhat strange hymn , which yet possesses , rightly understood , a real grandeur :</p>

   <p>One more , and we shall take our leave of Dr. Donne . It is called a fragment ; but it seems to me complete . It will serve as a specimen of his best and at the same time of his most characteristic mode of presenting fine thoughts grotesquely attired .</p>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>RESURRECTION .</head>
     <l n="1">Sleep , sleep , old sun ; thou canst not have re-past<span type="note_anchor">[ 81 ]</span></l>
     <l n="2">As yet the wound thou took'st on Friday last .</l>
     <l n="3">Sleep then , and rest : the world may bear thy stay ;</l>
     <l n="4">A better sun rose before thee to-day ;</l>
     <l n="5">Who , not content to enlighten all that dwell</l>
     <l n="6">On the earth 's face as thou , enlightened hell ,</l>
     <l n="7">And made the dark fires languish in that vale ,</l>
     <l n="8">As at thy presence here our fires grow pale ;</l>
     <l n="9">Whose body , having walked on earth and now</l>
     <l n="10">Hastening to heaven , would , that he might allow</l>
     <l n="11">Himself unto all stations and fill all ,</l>
     <l n="12">For these three days become a mineral .</l>
     <l n="13">He was all gold when he lay down , but rose</l>
     <l n="14">All tincture ; and doth not alone dispose</l>
     <l n="15">Leaden and iron wills to good , but is</l>
     <l n="16">Of power to make even sinful flesh like his .</l>
     <l n="17">Had one of those , whose credulous piety</l>
     <l n="18">Thought that a soul one might discern and see</l>
     <l n="19">Go from a body , at this sepulchre been ,</l>
     <l n="20">And issuing from the sheet this body seen ,</l>
     <l n="21">He would have justly thought this body a soul ,</l>
     <l n="22">If not of any man , yet of the whole .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>What a strange mode of saying that he is our head , the captain of our salvation , the perfect humanity in which our life is hid ! Yet it has its dignity . When one has got over the oddity of these last six lines , the figure contained in them shows itself almost grand .</p>
   <p>As an individual specimen of the grotesque form holding a fine sense , regard for a moment the words ,</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">He was all gold when he lay down , but rose</l>
     <l n="2">All tincture ;</l>
   </lg>
   <p>which means , that , entirely good when he died , he was something yet greater when he rose , for he had gained the power of making others good : the tincture intended here was a substance whose touch would turn the basest metal into gold .</p>
   <p>Through his poems are scattered many fine passages ; but not even his large influence on the better poets who followed is sufficient to justify our listening to him longer now .</p>

    <head>CHAPTER VIII .</head>
    <head>BISHOP HALL AND GEORGE SANDYS .</head>
    <head>Joseph Hall , born in 1574 , a year after Dr. Donne , bishop , first of Exeter , next of Norwich , is best known by his satires . It is not for such that I can mention him : the most honest satire can claim no place amongst religious poems . It is doubtful if satire ever did any good . Its very language is that of the half-brute from which it is well named .</head>
     <l n="1">Here are three poems , however , which the bishop wrote for his choir .</l>
   </lg>
   <lg type="poem">

   <p>Polished as these are in comparison to those of Dr. Donne , and fine , too , as they are intrinsically , there are single phrases in his that are worth them all — except , indeed , that one splendid line ,</p>
   <p>Trample on Death and Hell in glorious glee .</p>
   <p>George Sandys , the son of an archbishop of York , and born in 1577 , is better known by his travels in the east than by his poetry . But his version of the Psalms is in good and various verse , not unfrequently graceful , sometimes fine . The following is not only in a popular rhythm , but is neat and melodious as well .</p>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>PSALM XCII .</head>

   <p>CHAPTER IX .</p>
   <p>A FEW OF THE ELIZABETHAN DRAMATISTS .</p>
   <p>From the nature of their adopted mode , we cannot look for much poetry of a devotional kind from the dramatists . That mode admitting of no utterance personal to the author , and requiring the scope of a play to bring out the intended truth , it is no wonder that , even in the dramas of Shakspere , profound as is the teaching they contain , we should find nothing immediately suitable to our purpose ; while neither has he left anything in other form approaching in kind what we seek . Ben Jonson , however , born in 1574 , who may be regarded as the sole representative of learning in the class , has left , amongst a large number of small pieces , three Poems of Devotion , whose merit may not indeed be great , but whose feeling is , I think , genuine . Whatever were his faults , and they were not few , hypocrisy was not one of them . His nature was fierce and honest . He might boast , but he could not pretend . His oscillation between the reformed and the Romish church can hardly have had other cause than a vacillating conviction . It could not have served any prudential end that we can see , to turn catholic in the reign of Elizabeth , while in prison for killing in a duel a player who had challenged him .</p>

   <p>Somewhat formal and artificial , no doubt ; rugged at the same time , like him who wrote them . When a man would utter that concerning which he has only felt , not thought , he can express himself only in the forms he has been taught , conventional or traditional . Let his powers be ever so much developed in respect of other things , here , where he has not meditated , he must understand as a child , think as a child , speak as a child . He can as yet generate no sufficing or worthy form natural to himself . But the utterance is not therefore untrue . There was no professional bias to cause the stream of Ben Jonson 's verses to flow in that channel . Indeed , feeling without thought , and the consequent combination of impulse to speak with lack of matter , is the cause of much of that common-place utterance concerning things of religion which is so wearisome , but which therefore it is not always fair to despise as cant .</p>
   <p>About the same age as Ben Jonson , though the date of his birth is unknown , I now come to mention Thomas Heywood , a most voluminous writer of plays , who wrote also a book , chiefly in verse , called The Hierarchy of the Blessed Angels , a strange work , in which , amongst much that is far from poetic , occur the following remarkable metaphysico-religious verses . He had strong Platonic tendencies , interesting himself chiefly however in those questions afterwards pursued by Dr. Henry More , concerning witches and such like subjects , which may be called the shadow of Platonism .</p>

   <p>Very remarkable verses from a dramatist ! They indicate substratum enough for any art if only the art be there . Even those who cannot enter into the philosophy of them , which ranks him among the mystics of whom I have yet to speak , will understand a good deal of it symbolically : for how could he be expected to keep his poetry and his philosophy distinct when of themselves they were so ready to run into one ; or in verse to define carefully betwixt degree and kind , when kinds themselves may rise by degrees ? To distinguish without separating ; to be able to see that what in their effects upon us are quite different , may yet be a grand flight of ascending steps , “ to stop — no record hath told where , ” belongs to the philosopher who is not born mutilated , but is a poet as well .</p>
   <p>John Fletcher , likewise a dramatist , the author of the following poem , was two years younger than Ben Jonson . It is , so far as I am aware , the sole non-dramatic voice he has left behind him . Its opening is an indignant apostrophe to certain men of pretended science , who in his time were much consulted — the Astrologers .</p>

   <p>There is a tone of contempt in the verses which is not religious ; but they express a true philosophy and a triumph of faith in God . The word honest is here equivalent to true .</p>
   <p>I am not certain whether I may not now be calling up a singer whose song will appear hardly to justify his presence in the choir . But its teaching is of high import , namely , of content and cheerfulness and courage , and being both worthy and melodious , it gravitates heavenward . The singer is yet another dramatist : I presume him to be Thomas Dekker . I cannot be certain , because others were concerned with him in the writing of the drama from which I take it . He it is who , in an often-quoted passage , styles our Lord “ The first true gentleman that ever breathed ; ” just as Chaucer , in a poem I have given , calls him “ The first stock-father of gentleness . ”</p>
   <p>We may call the little lyric</p>

    <head>CHAPTER X .</head>
    <head>SIR JOHN BEAUMONT AND DRUMMOND OF HAWTHORNDEN .</head>
    <head>Sir John Beaumont , born in 1582 , elder brother to the dramatist who wrote along with Fletcher , has left amongst his poems a few fine religious ones . From them I choose the following :</head>
    <head>OF THE EPIPHANY .</head>
     <l n="1">Fair eastern star , that art ordained to run</l>
     <l n="2">Before the sages , to the rising sun ,</l>
     <l n="3">Here cease thy course , and wonder that the cloud</l>
     <l n="4">Of this poor stable can thy Maker shroud :</l>
     <l n="5">Ye , heavenly bodies , glory to be bright ,</l>
     <l n="6">And are esteemed as ye are rich in light ;</l>
     <l n="7">But here on earth is taught a different way ,</l>
     <l n="8">Since under this low roof the highest lay .</l>
     <l n="9">Jerusalem erects her stately towers ,</l>
     <l n="10">Displays her windows , and adorns her bowers ;</l>
     <l n="11">Yet there thou must not cast a trembling spark :</l>
     <l n="12">Let Herod 's palace still continue dark ;</l>
     <l n="13">Each school and synagogue thy force repels ,</l>
     <l n="14">There Pride , enthroned in misty errors , dwells ;</l>
     <l n="15">The temple , where the priests maintain their choir ,</l>
     <l n="16">Shall taste no beam of thy celestial fire ,</l>
     <l n="17">While this weak cottage all thy splendour takes :</l>
     <l n="18">A joyful gate of every chink it makes .</l>
     <l n="19">Here shines no golden roof , no ivory stair ,</l>
     <l n="20">No king exalted in a stately chair ,</l>
     <l n="21">Girt with attendants , or by heralds styled ,</l>
     <l n="22">But straw and hay enwrap a speechless child ;</l>
     <l n="23">Yet Sabae 's lords before this babe unfold</l>
     <l n="24">Their treasures , offering incense , myrrh , and gold .</l>
     <l n="25">The crib becomes an altar : therefore dies</l>
     <l n="26">No ox nor sheep ; for in their fodder lies</l>
     <l n="27">The Prince of Peace , who , thankful for his bed ,</l>
     <l n="28">Destroys those rites in which their blood was shed :</l>
     <l n="29">The quintessence of earth he takes and<span type="note_anchor">[ 87 ]</span>fees ,</l>
     <l n="30">And precious gums distilled from weeping trees ;</l>
     <l n="31">Rich metals and sweet odours now declare</l>
     <l n="32">The glorious blessings which his laws prepare ,</l>
     <l n="33">To clear us from the base and loathsome flood</l>
     <l n="34">Of sense , and make us fit for angels ’ food ,</l>
     <l n="35">Who lift to God for us the holy smoke</l>
     <l n="36">Of fervent prayers with which we him invoke ,</l>
     <l n="37">And try our actions in that searching fire ,</l>
     <l n="38">By which the seraphims our lips inspire :</l>
     <l n="39">No muddy dross pure minerals shall infect ,</l>
     <l n="40">We shall exhale our vapours up direct :</l>
     <l n="41">No storms shall cross , nor glittering lights deface</l>
     <l n="42">Perpetual sighs which seek a happy place .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The creatures , no longer offered on his altar , standing around the Prince of Life , to whom they have given a bed , is a lovely idea . The end is hardly worthy of the rest , though there is fine thought involved in it .</p>
   <p>The following contains an utterance of personal experience , the truth of which will be recognized by all to whom heavenly aspiration and needful disappointment are not unknown .</p>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>IN DESOLATION .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">O thou who sweetly bend'st my stubborn will ,</l>
     <l n="2">Who send'st thy stripes to teach and not to kill !</l>
     <l n="3">Thy cheerful face from me no longer hide ;</l>
     <l n="4">Withdraw these clouds , the scourges of my pride ;</l>
     <l n="5">I sink to hell , if I be lower thrown :</l>
     <l n="6">I see what man is , being left alone .</l>

     <l n="15">To paint this baseness , nature is too base ;</l>
     <l n="16">This darkness yields not but to beams of grace .</l>

     <l n="18">Or found , how shall it guide me , being blind ?</l>
     <l n="19">Grace is a taste of bliss , a glorious gift ,</l>
     <l n="20">Which can the soul to heavenly comforts lift :</l>
     <l n="21">It will not shine to me , whose mind is drowned</l>
     <l n="22">In sorrows , and with worldly troubles bound ;</l>
     <l n="23">It will not deign within that house to dwell ,</l>
     <l n="24">Where dryness reigns , and proud distractions swell .</l>
     <l n="25">Perhaps it sought me in those lightsome days</l>
     <l n="26">Of my first fervour , when few winds did raise</l>
     <l n="27">The waves , and ere they could full strength obtain ,</l>
     <l n="28">Some whispering gale straight charmed them down again ;</l>

     <l n="32">Of complacence , that sly , deceitful snake ;</l>
     <l n="33">When yet I had not dangerously refused</l>
     <l n="34">So many calls to virtue , nor abused</l>
     <l n="35">The spring of life , which I so oft enjoyed ,</l>

     <l n="39">Yet in that state this only good I found ,</l>

     <l n="48">Grace comes as oft clad in the dusky robe</l>
     <l n="49">Of desolation , as in white attire ,</l>
     <l n="50">Which better fits the bright celestial choir .</l>
     <l n="51">Some in foul seasons perish through despair ,</l>
     <l n="52">But more through boldness when the days are fair .</l>
     <l n="53">This then must be the medicine for my woes —</l>
     <l n="54">To yield to what my Saviour shall dispose ;</l>
     <l n="55">To glory in my baseness ; to rejoice</l>
     <l n="56">In mine afflictions ; to obey his voice ,</l>

   <p>William Drummond of Hawthornden , a Scotchman , born in 1585 , may almost be looked upon as the harbinger of a fresh outburst of word-music . No doubt all the great poets have now and then broken forth in lyrical jubilation . Ponderous Ben Jonson himself , when he takes to song , will sing in the joy of the very sound ; but great men have always so much graver work to do , that they comparatively seldom indulge in this kind of melody . Drummond excels in madrigals , or canzonets — baby-odes or songs — which have more of wing and less of thought than sonnets . Through the greater part of his verse we hear a certain muffled tone of the sweetest , like the music that ever threatens to break out clear from the brook , from the pines , from the rain-shower ,— never does break out clear , but remains a suggested , etherially vanishing tone . His is a voix voilée , or veiled voice of song . It is true that in the time we are now approaching far more attention was paid not merely to the smoothness but to the melody of verse than any except the great masters had paid before ; but some are at the door , who , not being great masters , yet do their inferior part nearly as well as they their higher , uttering a music of marvellous and individual sweetness , which no mere musical care could secure , but which springs essentially from music in the thought gathering to itself musical words in melodious division , and thus fashioning for itself a fitting body . The melody of their verse is all their own — as original as the greatest art-forms of the masters . Of Drummond , then , here are two sonnets on the Nativity ; the first spoken by the angels , the second by the shepherds .</p>
   <p>The Angels .</p>

   <p>No doubt there is a touch of the conventional in these . Especially in the close of the last there is an attempt to glorify the true by the homage of the false . But verses which make us feel the marvel afresh — the marvel visible and credible by the depth of its heart of glory — make us at the same time easily forget the discord in themselves .</p>
   <p>The following , not a sonnet , although it looks like one , measuring the lawful fourteen lines , is the closing paragraph of a poem he calls A Hymn to the Fairest Fair .</p>

   <p>CHAPTER XI .</p>
   <p>THE BROTHERS FLETCHER .</p>
   <p>I now come to make mention of two gifted brothers , Giles and Phineas Fletcher , both clergymen , the sons of a clergyman and nephews to the Bishop of Bristol , therefore the cousins of Fletcher the dramatist , a poem by whom I have already given Giles , the eldest , is supposed to have been born in 1588 . From his poem Christ 's Victory and Triumph , I select three passages .</p>
   <p>To understand the first , it is necessary to explain that while Christ is on earth a dispute between Justice and Mercy , such as is often represented by the theologians , takes place in heaven . We must allow the unsuitable fiction attributing distraction to the divine Unity , for the sake of the words in which Mercy overthrows the arguments of Justice . For the poet unintentionally nullifies the symbolism of the theologian , representing Justice as defeated . He forgets that the grandest exercise of justice is mercy . The confusion comes from the fancy that justice means vengeance upon sin , and not the doing of what is right . Justice can be at no strife with mercy , for not to do what is just would be most unmerciful .</p>
   <p>Mercy first sums up the arguments Justice has been employing against her , in the following stanza :</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">He was but dust ; why feared he not to fall ?</l>
     <l n="2">And being fallen how can he hope to live ?</l>
     <l n="3">Cannot the hand destroy him that made all ?</l>
     <l n="4">Could he not take away as well as give ?</l>
     <l n="5">Should man deprave , and should not God deprive ?</l>
     <l n="6">Was it not all the world 's deceiving spirit</l>
     <l n="7">( That , bladdered up with pride of his own merit ,</l>
     <l n="8">Fell in his rise ) that him of heaven did disinherit ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">To these she then proceeds to make reply :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="10">He was but dust : how could he stand before him ?</l>
     <l n="11">And being fallen , why should he fear to die ?</l>
     <l n="12">Cannot the hand that made him first , restore him ?</l>
     <l n="13">Depraved of sin , should he deprivéd lie</l>
     <l n="14">Of grace ? Can he not find infirmity</l>
     <l n="15">That gave him strength ?— Unworthy the forsaking</l>
     <l n="16">He is , whoever weighs ( without mistaking )</l>
     <l n="17">Or maker of the man or manner of his making .<span type="note_anchor">[ 89 ]</span></l>

     <l n="22">Her vials breathing orisons of price ,</l>
     <l n="23">If all must pay that which all cannot pay ?</l>

   <p>No doubt there are here touches of execrable taste , such as the punning trick with man and manners , suggesting a false antithesis ; or the opposition of the words deprave and deprive ; but we have in them only an instance of how the meretricious may co-exist with the lovely . The passage is fine and powerful , notwithstanding its faults and obscurities .</p>

   <p>These brothers were intense admirers of Spenser . To be like him Phineas must write an allegory ; and such an allegory ! Of all the strange poems in existence , surely this is the strangest . The Purple Island is man , whose body is anatomically described after the allegory of a city , which is then peopled with all the human faculties personified , each set in motion by itself . They say the anatomy is correct : the metaphysics are certainly good . The action of the poem is just another form of the Holy War of John Bunyan — all the good and bad powers fighting for the possession of the Purple Island . What renders the conception yet more amazing is the fact that the whole ponderous mass of anatomy and metaphysics , nearly as long as the Paradise Lost , is put as a song , in a succession of twelve cantos , in the mouth of a shepherd , who begins a canto every morning to the shepherds and shepherdesses of the neighbourhood , and finishes it by folding-time in the evening . And yet the poem is full of poetry . He triumphs over his difficulties partly by audacity , partly by seriousness , partly by the enchantment of song . But the poem will never be read through except by students of English literature . It is a whole ; its members are well-fitted ; it is full of beauties — in parts they swarm like fire-flies ; and yet it is not a good poem . It is like a well-shaped house , built of mud , and stuck full of precious stones . I do not care , in my limited space , to quote from it . Never was there a more incongruous dragon of allegory .</p>
   <p>Both brothers were injured , not by their worship of Spenser , but by the form that worship took — imitation . They seem more pleased to produce a line or stanza that shall recall a line or stanza of Spenser , than to produce a fine original of their own . They even copy lines almost word for word from their great master . This is pure homage : it was their delight that such adaptations should be recognized — just as it was Spenser 's hope , when he inserted translated stanzas from Tasso 's Jerusalem Delivered in The Fairy Queen , to gain the honour of a true reproduction . Yet , strange fate for imitators ! both , but Giles especially , were imitated by a greater than their worship — even by Milton . They make Spenser 's worse ; Milton makes theirs better . They imitate Spenser , faults and all ; Milton glorifies their beauties .</p>
   <p>From the smaller poems of Phineas , I choose the following version of</p>
   <lg type="poem">

     <l n="25">I shall now give two stanzas of his version of the 127th Psalm .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="26">If God build not the house , and lay</l>
     <l n="27">The groundwork sure — whoever build ,</l>
     <l n="28">It cannot stand one stormy day .</l>
     <l n="29">If God be not the city 's shield ,</l>
     <l n="30">If he be not their bars and wall ,</l>
     <l n="31">In vain is watch-tower , men , and all .</l>

     <l n="32">Though then thou wak'st when others rest ,</l>

     <l n="34">Though with lean care thou daily feast ,</l>
     <l n="35">Thy labour 's lost , and thou undone ;</l>
     <l n="36">But God his child will feed and keep ,</l>
     <l n="37">And draw the curtains to his sleep .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Compare this with a version of the same portion by Dr. Henry King , Bishop of Chichester , who , no great poet , has written some good verse . He was about the same age as Phineas Fletcher .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Except the Lord the house sustain ,</l>
     <l n="2">The builder 's labour is in vain ;</l>
     <l n="3">Except the city he defend ,</l>
     <l n="4">And to the dwellers safety send ,</l>
     <l n="5">In vain are sentinels prepared ,</l>
     <l n="6">Or arméd watchmen for the guard .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="7">You vainly with the early light</l>
     <l n="8">Arise , or sit up late at night</l>
     <l n="9">To find support , and daily eat</l>
     <l n="10">Your bread with sorrow earned and sweat ;</l>
     <l n="11">When God , who his beloved keeps ,</l>
     <l n="12">This plenty gives with quiet sleeps .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>What difference do we find ? That the former has the more poetic touch , the latter the greater truth . The former has just lost the one precious thing in the psalm ; the latter has kept it : that care is as useless as painful , for God gives us while we sleep , and not while we labour .</p>
   <p>CHAPTER XII .</p>
   <p>WITHER , HERRICK , AND QUARLES .</p>
   <p>George Wither , born in 1588 , therefore about the same age as Giles Fletcher , was a very different sort of writer indeed . There could hardly be a greater contrast . Fancy , and all her motley train , were scarcely known to Wither , save by the hearing of the ears .</p>
   <p>He became an eager Puritan towards the close of his life , but his poetry chiefly belongs to the earlier part of it . Throughout it is distinguished by a certain straightforward simplicity of good English thought and English word . His hymns remind me , in the form of their speech , of Gascoigne . I shall quote but little ; for , although there is a sweet calm and a great justice of reflection and feeling , there is hardly anything of that warming glow , that rousing force , that impressive weight in his verse , which is the chief virtue of the lofty rhyme .</p>
   <p>The best in a volume of ninety Hymns and Songs of the Church , is , I think , The Author 's Hymn at the close , of which I give three stanzas . They manifest the simplicity and truth of the man , reflecting in their very tone his faithful , contented , trustful nature .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">By thy grace , those passions , troubles ,</l>
     <l n="2">And those wants that me opprest ,</l>
     <l n="3">Have appeared as water-bubbles ,</l>
     <l n="4">Or as dreams , and things in jest :</l>
     <l n="5">For , thy leisure still attending ,</l>
     <l n="6">I with pleasure saw their ending .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="7">Those afflictions and those terrors ,</l>
     <l n="8">Which to others grim appear ,</l>
     <l n="9">Did but show me where my errors</l>
     <l n="10">And my imperfections were ;</l>
     <l n="11">But distrustful could not make me</l>
     <l n="12">Of thy love , nor fright nor shake me .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="13">Those base hopes that would possess me ,</l>
     <l n="14">And those thoughts of vain repute</l>
     <l n="15">Which do now and then oppress me ,</l>
     <l n="16">Do not , Lord , to me impute ;</l>
     <l n="17">And though part they will not from me ,</l>
     <l n="18">Let them never overcome me .</l>
    </lg>

   <p>He has written another similar volume , but much larger , and of a somewhat extraordinary character . It consists of no fewer than two hundred and thirty-three hymns , mostly long , upon an incredible variety of subjects , comprehending one for every season of nature and of the church , and one for every occurrence in life of which the author could think as likely to confront man or woman . Of these subjects I quote a few of the more remarkable , but even from them my reader can have little conception of the variety in the book : A Hymn whilst we are washing ; In a clear starry Night ; A Hymn for a House-warming ; After a great Frost or Snow ; For one whose Beauty is much praised ; For one upbraided with Deformity ; For a Widower or a Widow delivered from a troublesome Yokefellow ; For a Cripple ; For a Jailor ; For a Poet .</p>
   <p>Here is a portion of one which I hope may be helpful to some of my readers .</p>
   <lg type="poem">

    <lg type="stanza" n="6">

   <p>Before examining the volume , one would say that no man could write so many hymns without frequent and signal failure . But the marvel here is , that the hymns are all so very far from bad . He can never have written in other than a gentle mood . There must have been a fine harmony in his nature , that kept him , as it were . This peacefulness makes him interesting in spite of his comparative flatness . I must restrain remark , however , and give five out of twelve stanzas of another of his hymns .</p>

   <p>I think George Wither 's verses will grow upon the reader of them , tame as they are sure to appear at first . His Hallelujah , or Britain 's Second Remembrancer , from which I have been quoting , is well worth possessing , and can be procured without difficulty .</p>
   <p>We now come to a new sort , both of man and poet — still a clergyman . It is an especial pleasure to write the name of Robert Herrick amongst the poets of religion , for the very act records that the jolly , careless Anacreon of the church , with his head and heart crowded with pleasures , threw down at length his wine-cup , tore the roses from his head , and knelt in the dust .</p>
   <p>Nothing bears Herrick 's name so unrefined as the things Dr. Donne wrote in his youth ; but the impression made by his earlier poems is of a man of far shallower nature , and greatly more absorbed in the delights of the passing hour . In the year 1648 , when he was fifty-seven years of age , being prominent as a Royalist , he was ejected from his living by the dominant Puritans ; and in that same year he published his poems , of which the latter part and later written is his Noble Numbers , or religious poems . We may wonder at his publishing the Hesperides along with them , but we must not forget that , while the manners of a time are never to be taken as a justification of what is wrong , the judgment of men concerning what is wrong will be greatly influenced by those manners — not necessarily on the side of laxity . It is but fair to receive his own testimony concerning himself , offered in these two lines printed at the close of his Hesperides :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">To his book 's end this last line he 'd have placed :</l>
     <l n="2">Jocund his muse was , but his life was chaste .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>We find the same artist in the Noble Numbers as in the Hesperides , but hardly the same man . However far he may have been from the model of a clergyman in the earlier period of his history , partly no doubt from the society to which his power of song made him acceptable , I cannot believe that these later poems are the results of mood , still less the results of mere professional bias , or even sense of professional duty .</p>
   <p>In a good many of his poems he touches the heart of truth ; in others , even those of epigrammatic form , he must be allowed to fail in point as well as in meaning . As to his art-forms , he is guilty of great offences , the result of the same passion for lawless figures and similitudes which Dr. Donne so freely indulged . But his verses are brightened by a certain almost childishly quaint and innocent humour ; while the tenderness of some of them rises on the reader like the aurora of the coming sun of George Herbert . I do not forget that , even if some of his poems were printed in 1639 , years before that George Herbert had done his work and gone home : my figure stands in relation to the order I have adopted .</p>
   <p>Some of his verse is homelier than even George Herbert 's homeliest . One of its most remarkable traits is a quaint thanksgiving for the commonest things by name — not the less real that it is sometimes even queer . For instance :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">God gives not only corn for need ,</l>
     <l n="2">But likewise superabundant seed ;</l>
     <l n="3">Bread for our service , bread for show ;</l>
     <l n="4">Meat for our meals , and fragments too :</l>
     <l n="5">He gives not poorly , taking some</l>
     <l n="6">Between the finger and the thumb ,</l>
     <l n="7">But for our glut , and for our store ,</l>
     <l n="8">Fine flour pressed down , and running o'er .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Here is another , delightful in its oddity . We can fancy the merry yet gracious poet chuckling over the vision of the child and the fancy of his words .</p>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>A GRACE FOR A CHILD .</head>
     <l n="1">Here a little child I stand ,</l>
     <l n="2">Heaving up my either hand ;</l>
     <l n="3">Cold as paddocks though they be , frogs .</l>
     <l n="4">Here I lift them up to thee ,</l>
     <l n="5">For a benison to fall</l>
     <l n="6">On our meat , and on us all . Amen .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>I shall now give two or three of his longer poems , which are not long , and then a few of his short ones . The best known is the following , but it is not so well known that I must therefore omit it .</p>

   <p>Francis Quarles was born in 1592 . I have not much to say about him , popular as he was in his own day , for a large portion of his writing takes the shape of satire , which I consider only an active form of negation . I doubt much if mere opposition to the false is of any benefit . Convince a man by argument that the thing he has been taught is false , and you leave his house empty , swept , and garnished ; but the expulsion of the falsehood is no protection against its re-entrance in another mask , with seven worse than itself in its company . The right effort of the teacher is to give the positive — to present , as he may , the vision of reality , for the perception of which , and not for the discovery of falsehood , is man created . This will not only cast out the demon , but so people the house that he will not dare return . If a man might disprove all the untruths in creation , he would hardly be a hair 's breadth nearer the end of his own making . It is better to hold honestly one fragment of truth in the midst of immeasurable error , than to sit alone , if that were possible , in the midst of an absolute vision , clear as the hyaline , but only repellent of falsehood , not receptive of truth . It is the positive by which a man shall live . Truth is his life . The refusal of the false is not the reception of the true . A man may deny himself into a spiritual lethargy , without denying one truth , simply by spending his strength for that which is not bread , until he has none left wherewith to search for the truth , which alone can feed him . Only when subjected to the positive does the negative find its true vocation .</p>
   <p>I am jealous of the living force cast into the slough of satire . No doubt , either indignant or loving rebuke has its end and does its work , but I fear that wit , while rousing the admiration of the spiteful or the like witty , comes in only to destroy its dignity . At the same time , I am not sure whether there might not be such a judicious combination of the elements as to render my remarks inapplicable .</p>
   <p>At all events , poetry favours the positive , and from the Emblems named of Quarles I shall choose one in which it fully predominates . There is something in it remarkably fine .</p>

   <p>With honoured , thrice honoured George Herbert waiting at the door , I cannot ask Francis Quarles to remain longer : I can part with him without regret , worthy man and fair poet as he is .</p>
   <p>CHAPTER XIII .</p>
   <p>GEORGE HERBERT .</p>
   <p>But , with my hand on the lock , I shrink from opening the door . Here comes a poet indeed ! and how am I to show him due honour ? With his book humbly , doubtfully offered , with the ashes of the poems of his youth fluttering in the wind of his priestly garments , he crosses the threshold . Or rather , for I had forgotten the symbol of my book , let us all go from our chapel to the choir , and humbly ask him to sing that he may make us worthy of his song .</p>
   <p>In George Herbert there is poetry enough and to spare : it is the household bread of his being . If I begin with that which first in the nature of things ought to be demanded of a poet , namely , Truth , Revelation — George Herbert offers us measure pressed down and running over . But let me speak first of that which first in time or order of appearance we demand of a poet , namely music . For inasmuch as verse is for the ear , not for the eye , we demand a good hearing first . Let no one undervalue it . The heart of poetry is indeed truth , but its garments are music , and the garments come first in the process of revelation . The music of a poem is its meaning in sound as distinguished from word — its meaning in solution , as it were , uncrystallized by articulation . The music goes before the fuller revelation , preparing its way . The sound of a verse is the harbinger of the truth contained therein . If it be a right poem , this will be true . Herein Herbert excels . It will be found impossible to separate the music of his words from the music of the thought which takes shape in their sound .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">I got me flowers to strow thy way ,</l>
     <l n="2">I got me boughs off many a tree ;</l>
     <l n="3">But thou wast up by break of day ,</l>
     <l n="4">And brought'st thy sweets along with thee .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>And the gift it enwraps at once and reveals is , I have said , truth of the deepest . Hear this song of divine service . In every song he sings a spiritual fact will be found its fundamental life , although I may quote this or that merely to illustrate some peculiarity of mode .</p>
   <p>The Elixir was an imagined liquid sought by the old physical investigators , in order that by its means they might turn every common metal into gold , a pursuit not quite so absurd as it has since appeared . They called this something , when regarded as a solid , the Philosopher 's Stone . In the poem it is also called a tincture .</p>

   <p>With a conscience tender as a child 's , almost diseased in its tenderness , and a heart loving as a woman 's , his intellect is none the less powerful . Its movements are as the sword-play of an alert , poised , well-knit , strong-wristed fencer with the rapier , in which the skill impresses one more than the force , while without the force the skill would be valueless , even hurtful , to its possessor . There is a graceful humour with it occasionally , even in his most serious poems adding much to their charm . To illustrate all this , take the following , the title of which means The Retort .</p>

   <p>No writer before him has shown such a love to God , such a childlike confidence in him . The love is like the love of those whose verses came first in my volume . But the nation had learned to think more , and new difficulties had consequently arisen . These , again , had to be undermined by deeper thought , and the discovery of yet deeper truth had been the reward . Hence , the love itself , if it had not strengthened , had at least grown deeper . And George Herbert had had difficulty enough in himself ; for , born of high family , by nature fitted to shine in that society where elegance of mind , person , carriage , and utterance is most appreciated , and having indeed enjoyed something of the life of a courtier , he had forsaken all in obedience to the voice of his higher nature . Hence the struggle between his tastes and his duties would come and come again , augmented probably by such austere notions as every conscientious man must entertain in proportion to his inability to find God in that in which he might find him . From this inability , inseparable in its varying degrees from the very nature of growth , springs all the asceticism of good men , whose love to God will be the greater as their growing insight reveals him in his world , and their growing faith approaches to the giving of thanks in everything .</p>
   <p>When we have discovered the truth that whatsoever is not of faith is sin , the way to meet it is not to forsake the human law , but so to obey it as to thank God for it . To leave the world and go into the desert is not thus to give thanks : it may have been the only way for this or that man , in his blameless blindness , to take . The divine mind of George Herbert , however , was in the main bent upon discovering God everywhere .</p>
   <p>The poem I give next , powerfully sets forth the struggle between liking and duty of which I have spoken . It is at the same time an instance of wonderful art in construction , all the force of the germinal thought kept in reserve , to burst forth at the last . He calls it — meaning by the word , God 's Restraint —</p>

   <p>Coming now to speak of his art , let me say something first about his use of homeliest imagery for highest thought . This , I think , is in itself enough to class him with the highest kind of poets . If my reader will refer to The Elixir , he will see an instance in the third stanza , “ You may look at the glass , or at the sky : ” “ You may regard your action only , or that action as the will of God . ” Again , let him listen to the pathos and simplicity of this one stanza , from a poem he calls The Flower . He has been in trouble ; his times have been evil ; he has felt a spiritual old age creeping upon him ; but he is once more awake .</p>

   <p>He has an exquisite feeling of lyrical art . Not only does he keep to one idea in it , but he finishes the poem like a cameo . Here is an instance wherein he outdoes the elaboration of a Norman trouvère ; for not merely does each line in each stanza end with the same sound as the corresponding line in every other stanza , but it ends with the very same word . I shall hardly care to defend this if my reader chooses to call it a whim ; but I do say that a large degree of the peculiar musical effect of the poem — subservient to the thought , keeping it dimly chiming in the head until it breaks out clear and triumphant like a silver bell in the last — is owing to this use of the same column of words at the line-ends of every stanza . Let him who doubts it , read the poem aloud .</p>

   <p>Note the flow and the ebb of the lines of each stanza — from six to eight to ten syllables , and back through eight to six , the number of stanzas corresponding to the number of lines in each ; only the poem itself begins with the ebb , and ends with a full spring-flow of energy . Note also the perfect antithesis in their parts between the first and second stanzas , and how the last line of the poem clenches the whole in revealing its idea — that for the sake of which it was written . In a word , note the unity .</p>
   <p>Born in 1593 , notwithstanding his exquisite art , he could not escape being influenced by the faulty tendencies of his age , borne in upon his youth by the example of his mother 's friend , Dr. Donne . A man must be a giant like Shakspere or Milton to cast off his age 's faults . Indeed no man has more of the “ quips and cranks and wanton wiles ” of the poetic spirit of his time than George Herbert , but with this difference from the rest of Dr. Donne 's school , that such is the indwelling potency that it causes even these to shine with a radiance such that we wish them still to burn and not be consumed . His muse is seldom other than graceful , even when her motions are grotesque , and he is always a gentleman , which cannot be said of his master . We could not bear to part with his most fantastic oddities , they are so interpenetrated with his genius as well as his art .</p>
   <p>In relation to the use he makes of these faulty forms , and to show that even herein he has exercised a refraining judgment , though indeed fancying he has quite discarded in only somewhat reforming it , I recommend the study of two poems , each of which he calls Jordan , though why I have not yet with certainty discovered .</p>
   <p>It is possible that not many of his readers have observed the following instances of the freakish in his rhyming art , which however result well . When I say so , I would not be supposed to approve of the freak , but only to acknowledge the success of the poet in his immediate intent . They are related to a certain tendency to mechanical contrivance not seldom associated with a love of art : it is art operating in the physical understanding . In the poem called Home , every stanza is perfectly finished till the last : in it , with an access of art or artfulness , he destroys the rhyme . I shall not quarrel with my reader if he calls it the latter , and regards it as art run to seed . And yet — and yet — I confess I have a latent liking for the trick . I shall give one or two stanzas out of the rather long poem , to lead up to the change in the last .</p>

   <p>There can hardly be a doubt that his tendency to unnatural forms was encouraged by the increase of respect to symbol and ceremony shown at this period by some of the external powers of the church — Bishop Laud in particular . Had all , however , who delight in symbols , a power , like George Herbert 's , of setting even within the horn-lanterns of the more arbitrary of them , such a light of poetry and devotion that their dull sides vanish in its piercing shine , and we forget the symbol utterly in the truth which it cannot obscure , then indeed our part would be to take and be thankful . But there never has been even a living true symbol which the dulness of those who will see the truth only in the symbol has not degraded into the very cockatrice-egg of sectarianism . The symbol is by such always more or less idolized , and the light within more or less patronized . If the truth , for the sake of which all symbols exist , were indeed the delight of those who claim it , the sectarianism of the church would vanish . But men on all sides call that the truth which is but its form or outward sign — material or verbal , true or arbitrary , it matters not which — and hence come strifes and divisions .</p>
   <p>Although George Herbert , however , could thus illumine all with his divine inspiration , we cannot help wondering whether , if he had betaken himself yet more to vital and less to half artificial symbols , the change would not have been a breaking of the pitcher and an outshining of the lamp . For a symbol may remind us of the truth , and at the same time obscure it — present it , and dull its effect . It is the temple of nature and not the temple of the church , the things made by the hands of God and not the things made by the hands of man , that afford the truest symbols of truth .</p>
   <p>I am anxious to be understood . The chief symbol of our faith , the Cross , it may be said , is not one of these natural symbols . I answer — No ; but neither is it an arbitrary symbol . It is not a symbol of a truth at all , but of a fact , of the infinitely grandest fact in the universe , which is itself the outcome and symbol of the grandest Truth . The Cross is an historical sign , not properly a symbol , except through the facts it reminds us of . On the other hand , baptism and the eucharist are symbols of the loftiest and profoundest kind , true to nature and all its meanings , as well as to the facts of which they remind us . They are in themselves symbols of the truths involved in the facts they commemorate .</p>
   <p>Of Nature 's symbols George Herbert has made large use ; but he would have been yet a greater poet if he had made a larger use of them still . Then at least we might have got rid of such oddities as the stanzas for steps up to the church-door , the first at the bottom of the page ; of the lines shaped into ugly altar-form ; and of the absurd Easter wings , made of ever lengthening lines . This would not have been much , I confess , nor the gain by their loss great ; but not to mention the larger supply of images graceful with the grace of God , who when he had made them said they were good , it would have led to the further purification of his taste , perhaps even to the casting out of all that could untimely move our mirth ; until possibly ( for illustration ) , instead of this lovely stanza , he would have given us even a lovelier :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Listen , sweet dove , unto my song ,</l>
     <l n="2">And spread thy golden wings on me ;</l>
     <l n="3">Hatching my tender heart so long ,</l>
     <l n="4">Till it get wing , and fly away with thee .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The stanza is indeed lovely , and true and tender and clever as well ; yet who can help smiling at the notion of the incubation of the heart-egg , although what the poet means is so good that the smile almost vanishes in a sigh ?</p>
   <p>There is no doubt that the works of man 's hands will also afford many true symbols ; but I do think that , in proportion as a man gives himself to those instead of studying Truth 's wardrobe of forms in nature , so will he decline from the high calling of the poet . George Herbert was too great to be himself much injured by the narrowness of the field whence he gathered his symbols ; but his song will be the worse for it in the ears of all but those who , having lost sight of or having never beheld the oneness of the God whose creation exists in virtue of his redemption , feel safer in a low-browed crypt than under “ the high embowed roof . ”</p>
   <p>When the desire after system or order degenerates from a need into a passion , or ruling idea , it closes , as may be seen in many women who are especial house-keepers , like an unyielding skin over the mind , to the death of all development from impulse and aspiration . The same thing holds in the church : anxiety about order and system will kill the life . This did not go near to being the result with George Herbert : his life was hid with Christ in God ; but the influence of his profession , as distinguished from his work , was hurtful to his calling as a poet . He of all men would scorn to claim social rank for spiritual service ; he of all men would not commit the blunder of supposing that prayer and praise are that service of God : they are prayer and praise , not service ; he knew that God can be served only through loving ministration to his sons and daughters , all needy of commonest human help : but , as the most devout of clergymen will be the readiest to confess , there is even a danger to their souls in the unvarying recurrence of the outward obligations of their service ; and , in like manner , the poet will fare ill if the conventions from which the holiest system is not free send him soaring with sealed eyes . George Herbert 's were but a little blinded thus ; yet something , we must allow , his poetry was injured by his profession . All that I say on this point , however , so far from diminishing his praise , adds thereto , setting forth only that he was such a poet as might have been greater yet , had the divine gift had free course . But again I rebuke myself and say , “ Thank God for George Herbert . ”</p>
   <p>To rid our spiritual palates of the clinging flavour of criticism , let me choose another song from his precious legacy — one less read , I presume , than many . It shows his tendency to asceticism — the fancy of forsaking God 's world in order to serve him ; it has besides many of the faults of the age , even to that of punning ; yet it is a lovely bit of art as well as a rich embodiment of tenderness .</p>

   <p>It will be observed how much George Herbert goes beyond all that have preceded him , in the expression of feeling as it flows from individual conditions , in the analysis of his own moods , in the logic of worship , if I may say so . His utterance is not merely of personal love and grief , but of the peculiar love and grief in the heart of George Herbert . There may be disease in such a mind ; but , if there be , it is a disease that will burn itself out . Such disease is , for men constituted like him , the only path to health . By health I mean that simple regard to the truth , to the will of God , which will turn away a man 's eyes from his own conditions , and leave God free to work his perfection in him — free , that is , of the interference of the man 's self-consciousness and anxiety . To this perfection St. Paul had come when he no longer cried out against the body of his death , no more judged his own self , but left all to the Father , caring only to do his will . It was enough to him then that God should judge him , for his will is the one good thing securing all good things . Amongst the keener delights of the life which is at the door , I look for the face of George Herbert , with whom to talk humbly would be in bliss a higher bliss .</p>

   <p>John Milton , born in 1608 , was twenty-four years of age when George Herbert died . Hardly might two good men present a greater contrast than these . In power and size , Milton greatly excels . If George Herbert 's utterance is like the sword-play of one skilful with the rapier , that of Milton is like the sword-play of an old knight , flashing his huge but keen-cutting blade in lightnings about his head . Compared with Herbert , Milton was a man in health . He never shows , at least , any diseased regard of himself . His eye is fixed on the truth , and he knows of no ill-faring . While a man looks thitherward , all the movements of his spirit reveal themselves only in peace .</p>
   <p>Everything conspired , or , should I not rather say ? everything was freely given , to make Milton a great poet . Leaving the original seed of melody , the primordial song in the soul which all his life was an effort to utter , let us regard for a moment the circumstances that favoured its development .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">His volant touch</l>
     <l n="2">Fied and pursued transverse the resonant fugue . ]</l>
   </lg>
   <p>From childhood he had listened to the sounds of the organ ; doubtless himself often gave breath to the soundboard with his hands on the lever of the bellows , while his father 's</p>
   <p>volant touch , Instinct through all proportions low and high , Fled and pursued transverse the resonant fugue ;</p>
   <p>and the father 's organ-harmony we yet hear in the son 's verse as in none but his . Those organ-sounds he has taken for the very breath of his speech , and articulated them . He had education and leisure , freedom to think , to travel , to observe : he was more than thirty before he had to earn a mouthful of bread by his own labour . Rushing at length into freedom 's battle , he stood in its storm with his hand on the wheel of the nation 's rudder , shouting many a bold word for God and the Truth , until , fulfilled of experience as of knowledge , God set up before him a canvas of utter darkness : he had to fill it with creatures of radiance . God blinded him with his hand , that , like the nightingale , he might “ sing darkling . ” Beyond all , his life was pure from his childhood , without which such poetry as his could never have come to the birth . It is the pure in heart who shall see God at length ; the pure in heart who now hear his harmonies . More than all yet , he devoted himself from the first to the will of God , and his prayer that he might write a great poem was heard .</p>
   <p>The unity of his being is the strength of Milton . He is harmony , sweet and bold , throughout . Not Philip Sidney , not George Herbert loved words and their melodies more than he ; while in their use he is more serious than either , and harder to please , uttering a music they have rarely approached . Yet even when speaking with “ most miraculous organ , ” with a grandeur never heard till then , he overflows in speech more like that of other men than theirs — he utters himself more simply , straightforwardly , dignifiedly , than they . His modes are larger and more human , more near to the forms of primary thought . Faithful and obedient to his art , he spends his power in no diversions . Like Shakspere , he can be silent , never hesitating to sweep away the finest lines should they mar the intent , progress , and flow of his poem . Even while he sings most abandonedly , it is ever with a care of his speech , it is ever with ordered words : not one shall dull the clarity of his verse by unlicensed , that is , needless presence . But let not my reader fancy that this implies laborious utterance and strained endeavour . It is weakness only which by the agony of visible effort enhances the magnitude of victory . The trained athlete will move with the grace of a child , for he has not to seek how to effect that which he means to perform . Milton has only to take good heed , and with no greater effort than it costs the ordinary man to avoid talking like a fool , he sings like an archangel .</p>
   <p>But I must not enlarge my remarks , for of his verse even I can find room for only a few lyrics . In them , however , we shall still find the simplest truth , the absolute of life , the poet 's aim . He is ever soaring towards the region beyond perturbation , the true condition of soul ; that is , wherein a man shall see things even as God would have him see them . He has no time to droop his pinions , and sit moody even on the highest pine : the sun is above him ; he must fly upwards .</p>
   <p>The youth who at three-and-twenty could write the following sonnet , might well at five-and-forty be capable of writing the one that follows :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">How soon hath Time , the subtle thief of youth ,</l>
     <l n="2">Stolen on his wing my three-and-twentieth year !</l>
     <l n="3">My hasting days fly on with full career ,</l>
     <l n="4">But my late spring no bud or blossom shew'th .</l>
     <l n="5">Perhaps my semblance might deceive the truth</l>
     <l n="6">That I to manhood am arrived so near ;</l>
     <l n="7">And inward ripeness doth much less appear ,</l>
     <l n="8">That some more timely happy spirits endu'th .</l>
     <l n="9">Yet be it less or more , or soon or slow ,</l>
     <l n="10">It shall be still in strictest measure even</l>
     <l n="11">To that same lot , however mean or high ,</l>
     <l n="12">Toward which time leads me and the will of heaven :</l>
     <l n="13">All is — if I have grace to use it so</l>
     <l n="14">As ever in my great Task-master 's eye .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The It which is the subject of the last six lines is his Ripeness : it will keep pace with his approaching lot ; when it arrives he will be ready for it , whatever it may be . The will of heaven is his happy fate . Even at three-and-twenty , “ he that believeth shall not make haste . ” Calm and open-eyed , he works to be ripe , and waits for the work that shall follow .</p>
   <p>At forty-five , then , he writes thus concerning his blindness :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">When I consider how my life is spent</l>
     <l n="2">Ere half my days in this dark world and wide ,</l>
     <l n="3">And that one talent , which is death to hide ,</l>
     <l n="4">Lodged with me useless , though my soul more bent</l>
     <l n="5">To serve therewith my Maker , and present</l>
     <l n="6">My true account , lest he , returning , chide —</l>
     <l n="7">“ Doth God exact day-labour , light denied ? ”</l>
     <l n="8">I fondly ask . But Patience , to prevent foolishly .</l>
     <l n="9">That murmur , soon replies : “ God doth not need</l>
     <l n="10">Either man 's work or his own gifts : who best</l>
     <l n="11">Bear his mild yoke , they serve him best : his state</l>
     <l n="12">Is kingly : thousands at his bidding speed ,</l>
     <l n="13">And post o'er land and ocean without rest :</l>
     <l n="14">They also serve who only stand and wait . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>That is , “ stand and wait , ready to go when they are called . ” Everybody knows the sonnet , but how could I omit it ? Both sonnets will grow more and more luminous as they are regarded .</p>
   <p>The following I incline to think the finest of his short poems , certainly the grandest of them . It is a little ode , written to be set on a clock-case .</p>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>ON TIME .</head>
     <l n="1">Fly , envious Time , till thou run out thy race .</l>
     <l n="2">Call on the lazy leaden-stepping hours ,</l>
     <l n="3">Whose speed is but the heavy plummet 's pace ,</l>
     <l n="4">And glut thyself with what thy womb devours —</l>
     <l n="5">Which is no more than what is false and vain ,</l>
     <l n="6">And merely mortal dross :</l>
     <l n="7">So little is our loss !</l>
     <l n="8">So little is thy gain !</l>
     <l n="9">For whenas each thing bad thou hast entombed ,</l>
     <l n="10">And last of all thy greedy self consumed ,</l>
     <l n="11">Then long eternity shall greet our bliss</l>
     <l n="12">With an individual kiss ; that cannot be divided —</l>
     <l n="13">And joy shall overtake us as a flood ; [ eternal .</l>
     <l n="14">When everything that is sincerely good ,</l>
     <l n="15">And perfectly divine</l>
     <l n="16">With truth and peace and love , shall ever shine</l>
     <l n="17">About the supreme throne</l>
     <l n="18">Of him to whose happy-making sight alone</l>
     <l n="19">When once our heavenly-guided soul shall climb ,</l>
     <l n="20">Then , all this earthy grossness quit ,</l>
     <l n="21">Attired with stars , we shall for ever sit</l>
     <l n="22">Triumphing over Death and Chance and thee , O Time .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The next I give is likewise an ode — a more beautiful one . Observe in both the fine effect of the short lines , essential to the nature of the ode , being that which gives its solemnity the character yet of a song , or rather , perhaps , of a chant .</p>
   <p>In this he calls upon Voice and Verse to rouse and raise our imagination until we hear the choral song of heaven , and hearing become able to sing in tuneful response .</p>
   <lg type="poem">

     <l n="4">Dead things with inbreathed sense able to pierce —</l>

     <l n="14">With those just spirits that wear victorious palms ,</l>

     <l n="16">Singing everlastingly ;</l>
     <l n="17">That we on earth , with undiscording voice ,</l>
     <l n="18">May rightly answer that melodious noise —</l>
     <l n="19">As once we did , till disproportioned<span type="note_anchor">[ 106 ]</span>Sin</l>
     <l n="20">Jarred against Nature 's chime , and with harsh din</l>
     <l n="21">Broke the fair music that all creatures made</l>
     <l n="22">To their great Lord , whose love their motion swayed</l>
     <l n="23">In perfect diapason ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 107 ]</span>whilst they stood</l>
     <l n="24">In first obedience and their state of good .</l>
     <l n="25">O may we soon again renew that song ,</l>
     <l n="26">And keep in tune with heaven , till God ere long</l>
     <l n="27">To his celestial consort<span type="note_anchor">[ 108 ]</span>us unite ,</l>
     <l n="28">To live with him , and sing in endless morn of light !</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Music was the symbol of all Truth to Milton . He would count it falsehood to write an unmusical verse . I allow that some of his blank lines may appear unrhythmical ; but Experience , especially if she bring with her a knowledge of Dante , will elucidate all their movements . I exhort my younger friends to read Milton aloud when they are alone , and thus learn the worth of word-sounds . They will find him even in this an educating force . The last ode ought to be thus read for the magnificent dance-march of its motion , as well as for its melody .</p>
   <p>Show me one who delights in the Hymn on the Nativity , and I will show you one who may never indeed be a singer in this world , but who is already a listener to the best . But how different it is from anything of George Herbert 's ! It sets forth no feeling peculiar to Milton ; it is an outburst of the gladness of the company of believers . Every one has at least read the glorious poem ; but were I to leave it out I should have lost , not the sapphire of aspiration , not the topaz of praise , not the emerald of holiness , but the carbuncle of delight from the high priest 's breast-plate . And I must give the introduction too : it is the cloudy grove of an overture , whence rushes the torrent of song .</p>

   <p>If my reader should think some of the rhymes bad , and some of the words oddly used , I would remind him that both pronunciations and meanings have altered since : the probability is , that the older forms in both are the better . Milton will not use a wrong word or a bad rhyme . With regard to the form of the poem , let him observe the variety of length of line in the stanza , and how skilfully the varied lines are associated — two of six syllables and one of ten ; then the same repeated ; then one of eight and one of twelve — no two , except of the shortest , coming together of the same length . Its stanza is its own : I do not know another poem written in the same ; and its music is exquisite . The probability is that , if the reader note any fact in the poem , however trifling it might seem to the careless eye , it will repay him by unfolding both individual and related beauty . Then let him ponder the pictures given : the sudden arraying of the shame-faced night in long beams ; the amazed kings silent on their thrones ; the birds brooding on the sea : he will find many such . Let him consider the clear-cut epithets , so full of meaning . A true poet may be at once known by the justice and force of the adjectives he uses , especially when he compounds them ,— that is , makes one out of two . Here are some examples : meek-eyed Peace ; pale-eyed priest ; speckled vanity ; smouldering clouds ; hideous hum ; dismal dance ; dusky eyne : there are many such , each almost a poem in itself . The whole is a succession of pictures set in the loveliest music for the utterance of grandest thoughts .</p>
   <p>No doubt there are in the poem instances of such faults in style as were common in the age in which his verse was rooted : for my own part , I never liked the first two stanzas of the hymn . But such instances are few ; while for a right feeling of the marvel of this poem and of the two preceding it , we must remember that Milton was only twenty-one when he wrote them .</p>
   <p>Apparently to make one of a set with the Nativity , he began to write an ode on the Passion , but , finding the subject “ above the years he had when he wrote it , and nothing satisfied with what was begun , left it unfinished . ” The fragment is full of unworthy , though skilful , and , for such , powerful conceits , but is especially interesting as showing how even Milton , trying to write about what he felt , but without yet having generated thoughts enow concerning the subject itself , could only fall back on conventionalities . Happy the young poet the wisdom of whose earliest years was such that he recognized his mistake almost at the outset , and dropped the attempt ! Amongst the stanzas there is , however , one of exceeding loveliness :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">He , sovereign priest , stooping his regal head ,</l>
     <l n="2">That dropped with odorous oil down his fair eyes ,</l>
     <l n="3">Poor fleshly tabernacle enteréd ,</l>
     <l n="4">His starry front low-roofed beneath the skies .</l>
     <l n="5">Oh what a masque was there ! what a disguise !</l>
     <l n="6">Yet more ! the stroke of death he must abide ;</l>
     <l n="7">Then lies him meekly down fast by his brethren 's side .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>In this it will be seen that he has left the jubilant measure of the Hymn , and returned to the more stately and solemn rhyme-royal of its overture , as more suited to his subject . Milton could not be wrong in his music , even when he found the quarry of his thought too hard to work .</p>

    <head>EDMUND WALLER , THOMAS BROWN , AND JEREMY TAYLOR .</head>
    <head>Edmund Waller , born in 1605 , was three years older than Milton ; but I had a fancy for not dividing Herbert and Milton . As a poet he had a high reputation for many years , gained chiefly , I think , by a regard to literary proprieties , combined with wit . He is graceful sometimes ; but what in his writings would with many pass for grace , is only smoothness and the absence of faults . His horses were not difficult to drive . He dares little and succeeds in proportion — occasionally , however , flashing out into true song . In politics he had no character — let us hope from weakness rather than from selfishness ; yet , towards the close of his life , he wrote some poems which reveal a man not unaccustomed to ponder sacred things , and able to express his thoughts concerning them with force and justice . From a poem called Of Divine Love , I gather the following very remarkable passages : I wish they had been enforced by greater nobility of character . Still they are in themselves true . Even where we have no proof of repentance , we may see plentiful signs of a growth towards it . We cannot tell how long the truth may of necessity require to interpenetrate the ramifications of a man 's nature . By slow degrees he discovers that here it is not , and there it is not . Again and again , and yet again , a man finds that he must be born with a new birth .</head>

   <p>It would be a poor victory where age was the sole conqueror . But I doubt if age ever gains the victory alone . Let Waller , however , have this praise : his song soars with his subject . It is a true praise . There are men who write well until they try the noble , and then they fare like the falling star , which , when sought where it fell , is , according to an old fancy , discovered a poor jelly .</p>
   <p>Sir Thomas Brown , a physician , whose prose writings are as peculiar as they are valuable , was of the same age as Waller . He partakes to a considerable degree of the mysticism which was so much followed in his day , only in his case it influences his literature most — his mode of utterance more than his mode of thought . His True Christian Morals is a very valuable book , notwithstanding the obscurity that sometimes arises in that , as in all his writings , from his fondness for Latin words . The following fine hymn occurs in his Religio Medici , in which he gives an account of his opinions . I am not aware of anything else that he has published in verse , though he must probably have written more to be able to write this so well . It occurs in the midst of prose , as the prayer he says every night before he yields to the death of sleep . I follow it with the succeeding sentence of the prose .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">The night is come . Like to the day ,</l>
     <l n="2">Depart not thou , great God , away .</l>
     <l n="3">Let not my sins , black as the night ,</l>
     <l n="4">Eclipse the lustre of thy light .</l>
     <l n="5">Keep still in my horizon , for to me</l>
     <l n="6">The sun makes not the day but thee .</l>
     <l n="7">Thou whose nature cannot sleep ,</l>
     <l n="8">On my temples sentry keep ;</l>
     <l n="9">Guard me ‘ gainst those watchful foes</l>
     <l n="10">Whose eyes are open while mine close .</l>
     <l n="11">Let no dreams my head infest</l>
     <l n="12">But such as Jacob 's temples blest .</l>
     <l n="13">While I do rest , my soul advance ;</l>
     <l n="14">Make my sleep a holy trance ,</l>
     <l n="15">That I may , my rest being wroughtt</l>
     <l n="16">Awake into some holy thought ,</l>
     <l n="17">And with as active vigour run</l>
     <l n="18">My course as doth the nimble sun .</l>
     <l n="19">Sleep is a death : O make me try</l>
     <l n="20">By sleeping what it is to die ,</l>
     <l n="21">And as gently lay my head</l>
     <l n="22">On my grave , as now my bed .</l>
     <l n="23">Howe'er I rest , great God , let me</l>
     <l n="24">Awake again at least with thee .</l>
     <l n="25">And thus assured , behold I lie</l>
     <l n="26">Securely , or to wake or die .</l>
     <l n="27">These are my drowsy days : in vain</l>
     <l n="28">I do now wake to sleep again :</l>
     <l n="29">O come that hour when I shall never</l>
     <l n="30">Sleep again , but wake for ever .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>“ This is the dormitive I take to bedward . I need no other laudanum than this to make me sleep ; after which I close mine eyes in security , content to take my leave of the sun , and sleep unto the resurrection . ”</p>
   <p>Jeremy Taylor , born in 1613 , was the most poetic of English prose-writers : if he had written verse equal to his prose , he would have had a lofty place amongst poets as well as amongst preachers . Taking the opposite side from Milton , than whom he was five years younger , he was , like him , conscientious and consistent , suffering while Milton 's cause prospered , and advanced to one of the bishoprics hated of Milton 's soul when the scales of England 's politics turned in the other direction . Such men , however , are divided only by their intellects . When men say , “ I must or I must not , for it is right or it is not right , ” then are they in reality so bound together , even should they not acknowledge it themselves , that no opposing opinions , no conflicting theories concerning what is or is not right , can really part them . It was not wonderful that a mind like that of Jeremy Taylor , best fitted for worshipping the beauty of holiness , should mourn over the disrupted order of his church , or that a mind like Milton 's , best fitted for the law of life , should demand that every part of that order which had ceased to vibrate responsive to every throb of the eternal heart of truth , should fall into the ruin which its death had preceded . The church was hardly dealt with , but the rulers of the church have to bear the blame .</p>
   <p>Here are those I judge the best of the bishop 's Festival Hymns , printed as part of his Golden Grove , or Gide to Devotion . In the first there is a little confusion of imagery ; and in others of them will be found a little obscurity . They bear marks of the careless impatience of rhythm and rhyme of one who though ever bursting into a natural trill of song , sometimes with more rhymes apparently than he intended , would yet rather let his thoughts pour themselves out in that unmeasured chant , that “ poetry in solution , ” which is the natural speech of the prophet-orator . He is like a full river that must flow , which rejoices in a flood , and rebels against the constraint of mole or conduit . He exults in utterance itself , caring little for the mode , which , however , the law of his indwelling melody guides though never compels . Charmingly diffuse in his prose , his verse ever sounds as if it would overflow the banks of its self-imposed restraints .</p>

   <p>CHAPTER XVI .</p>
   <p>HENRY MORE AND RICHARD BAXTER .</p>
   <p>Dr. Henry More was born in the year 1614 . Chiefly known for his mystical philosophy , which he cultivated in retirement at Cambridge , and taught not only in prose , but in an elaborate , occasionally poetic poem , of somewhere about a thousand Spenserian stanzas , called A Platonic Song of the Soul , he has left some smaller poems , from which I shall gather good store for my readers . Whatever may be thought of his theories , they belong at least to the highest order of philosophy ; and it will be seen from the poems I give that they must have borne their part in lifting the soul of the man towards a lofty spiritual condition of faith and fearlessness . The mystical philosophy seems to me safe enough in the hands of a poet : with others it may degenerate into dank and dusty materialism .</p>

   <p>Is it lawful , after reading this , to wonder whether Henry More , the retired , and so far untried , student of Cambridge , would have been able thus to meet the alternations of suffering which he imagines ? It is one thing to see reasonableness , another to be reasonable when objects have become circumstances . Would he , then , by spiritual might , have risen indeed above bodily torture ? It is possible for a man to arrive at this perfection ; it is absolutely necessary that a man should some day or other reach it ; and I think the wise doctor would have proved the truth of his principles . But there are many who would gladly part with their whole bodies rather than offend , and could not yet so rise above the invasions of the senses . Here , as in less important things , our business is not to speculate what we would do in other circumstances , but to perform the duty of the moment , the one true preparation for the duty to come . Possibly , however , the right development of our human relations in the world may be a more difficult and more important task still than this condition of divine alienation . To find God in others is better than to grow solely in the discovery of him in ourselves , if indeed the latter were possible .</p>

   <p>There are strange things and worth pondering in all these . An occasional classical allusion seems to us quite out of place , but such things we must pass . The poems are quite different from any we have had before . There has been only a few of such writers in our nation , but I suspect those have had a good deal more influence upon the religious life of it than many thinkers suppose . They are in closest sympathy with the deeper forms of truth employed by St. Paul and St. John . This last poem , concerning humility as the house in which charity dwells , is very truth . A repentant sinner feels that he is making himself little when he prays to be made humble : the Christian philosopher sees such a glory and spiritual wealth in humility that it appears to him almost too much to pray for .</p>
   <p>The very essence of these mystical writers seems to me to be poetry . They use the largest figures for the largest spiritual ideas — light for good , darkness for evil . Such symbols are the true bodies of the true ideas . For this service mainly what we term nature was called into being , namely , to furnish forms for truths , for without form truth cannot be uttered . Having found their symbols , these writers next proceed to use them logically ; and here begins the peculiar danger . When the logic leaves the poetry behind , it grows first presumptuous , then hard , then narrow and untrue to the original breadth of the symbol ; the glory of the symbol vanishes ; and the final result is a worship of the symbol , which has withered into an apple of Sodom . Witness some of the writings of the European master of the order — Swedenborg : the highest of them are rich in truth ; the lowest are poverty-stricken indeed .</p>
   <p>In 1615 was born Richard Baxter , one of the purest and wisest and devoutest of men — and no mean poet either . If ever a man sought between contending parties to do his duty , siding with each as each appeared right , opposing each as each appeared wrong , surely that man was Baxter . Hence he fared as all men too wise to be partisans must fare — he pleased neither Royalists nor Puritans . Dull of heart and sadly unlike a mother was the Church when , by the Act of Uniformity of Charles II ., she drove from her bosom such a son , with his two thousand brethren of the clergy !</p>
   <p>He has left us a good deal of verse — too much , perhaps , if we consider the length of the poems and the value of condensation . There is in many of them a delightful fervour of the simplest love to God , uttered with a plain half poetic , half logical strength , from which sometimes the poetry breaks out clear and fine . Much that he writes is of death , from the dread of which he evidently suffered — a good thing when it drives a man to renew his confidence in his Saviour 's presence . It has with him a very different origin from the vulgar fancy that to talk about death is religious . It was refuge from the fear of death he sought , and that is the part of every man who would not be a slave . The door of death of which he so often speaks is to him a door out of the fear of death .</p>
   <p>The poem from which the following excerpt is made was evidently written in view of some imminent suffering for conscience-sake , probably when the Act of Uniformity was passed : twenty years after , he was imprisoned at the age of sixty-seven , and lay nearly a year and a half .— I omit many verses .</p>

   <p>The allegory is so good that one is absolutely sorry when it breaks down , and the poem says in plain words that which is the subject of the figures , bringing truths unmasked into the midst of the maskers who represent truths — thus interrupting the pleasure of the artistic sense in the transparent illusion .</p>
   <p>The command of metrical form in Baxter is somewhat remarkable . He has not much melody , but he keeps good time in a variety of measures .</p>
   <p>CHAPTER XVII .</p>
   <p>CRASHAW AND MARVELL .</p>
   <p>I come now to one of the loveliest of our angel-birds , Richard Crashaw . Indeed he was like a bird in more senses than one ; for he belongs to that class of men who seem hardly ever to get foot-hold of this world , but are ever floating in the upper air of it .</p>
   <p>What I said of a peculiar Æolian word-music in William Drummond applies with equal truth to Crashaw ; while of our own poets , somehow or other , he reminds me of Shelley , in the silvery shine and bell-like melody both of his verse and his imagery ; and in one of his poems , Music 's Duel , the fineness of his phrase reminds me of Keats . But I must not forget that it is only with his sacred , his best poems too , that I am now concerned .</p>
   <p>The date of his birth is not known with certainty , but it is judged about 1616 , the year of Shakspere 's death . He was the son of a Protestant clergyman zealous even to controversy . By a not unnatural reaction Crashaw , by that time , it is said , a popular preacher , when expelled from Oxford in 1644 by the Puritan Parliament because of his refusal to sign their Covenant , became a Roman Catholic . He died about the age of thirty-four , a canon of the Church of Loretto . There is much in his verses of that sentimentalism which , I have already said in speaking of Southwell , is rife in modern Catholic poetry . I will give from Crashaw a specimen of the kind of it . Avoiding a more sacred object , one stanza from a poem of thirty-one , most musical , and full of lovely speech concerning the tears of Mary Magdalen , will suit my purpose .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Hail , sister springs ,</l>
     <l n="2">Parents of silver-footed rills !</l>
     <l n="3">Ever-bubbling things !</l>
     <l n="4">Thawing crystal ! Snowy hills ,</l>
     <l n="5">Still spending , never spent !— I mean</l>
     <l n="6">Thy fair eyes , sweet Magdalene !</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The poem is called The Weeper , and is radiant of delicate fancy . But surely such tones are not worthy of flitting moth-like about the holy sorrow of a repentant woman ! Fantastically beautiful , they but play with her grief . Sorrow herself would put her shoes off her feet in approaching the weeping Magdalene . They make much of her indeed , but they show her little reverence . There is in them , notwithstanding their fervour of amorous words , a coldness like that which dwells in the ghostly beauty of icicles shining in the moon .</p>
   <p>But I almost reproach myself for introducing Crashaw thus . I had to point out the fact , and now having done with it , I could heartily wish I had room to expatiate on his loveliness even in such poems as The Weeper .</p>
   <p>His Divine Epigrams are not the most beautiful , but they are to me the most valuable of his verses , inasmuch as they make us feel afresh the truth which he sets forth anew . In them some of the facts of our Lord 's life and teaching look out upon us as from clear windows of the past . As epigrams , too , they are excellent — pointed as a lance .</p>

When the priest forgets his mediation of a servant , his duty of a door-keeper to the temple of truth , and takes upon him the office of an intercessor , he stands between man and God , and is a Satan , an adversary . Artistically considered , the poem could hardly be improved .</p>
   <p>Here is another containing a similar lesson .</p>
   <p>I am not worthy that thou shouldst come under my roof .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Thy God was making haste into thy roof ;</l>
     <l n="2">Thy humble faith and fear keeps him aloof .</l>
     <l n="3">He 'll be thy guest : because he may not be ,</l>
     <l n="4">He 'll come — into thy house ? No ; into thee .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The following is a world-wide intercession for them that know not what they do . Of those that reject the truth , who can be said ever to have truly seen it ? A man must be good to see truth . It is a thought suggested by our Lord 's words , not an irreverent opposition to the truth of them .</p>
   <p>But now they have seen and hated .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Seen ? and yet hated thee ? They did not see —</l>
     <l n="2">They saw thee not , that saw and hated thee !</l>
     <l n="3">No , no ; they saw thee not , O Life ! O Love !</l>
     <l n="4">Who saw aught in thee that their hate could move .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>We must not be too ready to quarrel with every oddity : an oddity will sometimes just give the start to an outbreak of song . The strangeness of the following hymn rises almost into grandeur .</p>

   <p>When we come , in the writings of one who has revealed masterdom , upon any passage that seems commonplace , or any figure that suggests nothing true , the part of wisdom is to brood over that point ; for the probability is that the barrenness lies in us , two factors being necessary for the result of sight — the thing to be seen and the eye to see it . No doubt the expression may be inadequate , but if we can compensate the deficiency by adding more vision , so much the better for us .</p>
   <p>In the second stanza there is a strange combination of images : the rock buds ; and buds a fountain ; the fountain is light . But the images are so much one at the root , that they slide gracefully into each other , and there is no confusion or incongruity : the result is an inclined plane of development .</p>
   <p>I now come to the most musical and most graceful , therefore most lyrical , of his poems . I have left out just three stanzas , because of the sentimentalism of which I have spoken : I would have left out more if I could have done so without spoiling the symmetry of the poem . My reader must be friendly enough to one who is so friendly to him , to let his peculiarities pass unquestioned — amongst the rest his conceits , as well as the trifling discord that the shepherds should be called , after the classical fashion — ill agreeing , from its associations , with Christian song — Tityrus and Thyrsis .</p>

   <p>I pass by Abraham Cowley , mighty reputation as he has had , without further remark than that he is too vulgar to be admired more than occasionally , and too artificial almost to be , as a poet , loved at all .</p>
   <p>Andrew Marvell , member of Parliament for Hull both before and after the Restoration , was twelve years younger than his friend Milton . Any one of some half-dozen of his few poems is to my mind worth all the verse that Cowley ever made . It is a pity he wrote so little ; but his was a life as diligent , I presume , as it was honourable .</p>

    <head>ON A DROP OF DEW .</head>

     <l n="5">For the clear region where ‘ twas born ,</l>
     <l n="6">Round in itself encloses , used intransitively .</l>
     <l n="7">And in its little globe 's extent ,</l>
     <l n="8">Frames as it can its native element .</l>

     <l n="10">Scarce touching where it lies ,</l>
     <l n="11">But gazing back upon the skies ,</l>
     <l n="12">Shines with a mournful light ,</l>
     <l n="13">Like its own tear ,</l>
     <l n="14">Because so long divided from the sphere :</l>
     <l n="15">Restless it rolls , and unsecure ,</l>
     <l n="16">Trembling lest it grow impure ,</l>
     <l n="17">Till the warm sun pity its pain ,</l>
     <l n="18">And to the skies exhale it back again .</l>
     <l n="19">So the soul , that drop , that ray</l>

     <l n="21">Could it within the human flower be seen ,</l>
     <l n="22">Remembering still its former height ,</l>
     <l n="23">Shuns the sweet leaves and blossoms green ;</l>
     <l n="24">And , recollecting its own light ,</l>
     <l n="25">Does , in its pure and circling thoughts , express</l>
     <l n="26">The greater heaven in an heaven less .</l>
     <l n="27">In how coy a figure wound ,</l>
     <l n="28">Every way it turns away ,</l>
     <l n="29">So the world excluding round ,</l>
     <l n="30">Yet receiving in the day ;</l>
     <l n="31">Dark beneath but bright above ,</l>
     <l n="32">Here disdaining , there in love .</l>
     <l n="33">How loose and easy hence to go !</l>
     <l n="34">How girt and ready to ascend !</l>
     <l n="35">Moving but on a point below ,</l>
     <l n="36">It all about does upwards bend .</l>
     <l n="37">Such did the manna 's sacred dew distil —</l>
     <l n="38">White and entire ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 141 ]</span>though congealed and chill —</l>

     <l n="26">May crown thy feet that could not crown thy head .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>A true sacrifice of worship , if not a garland of praise ! The disciple would have his works tried by the fire , not only that the gold and the precious stones may emerge relucent , but that the wood and hay and stubble may perish . The will of God alone , not what we may have effected , deserves our care . In the perishing of our deeds they fall at his feet : in our willing their loss we crown his head .</p>
   <p>CHAPTER XVIII .</p>
   <p>A MOUNT OF VISION — HENRY VAUGHAN .</p>
   <p>We have now arrived at the borders of a long , dreary tract , which , happily for my readers , I can shorten for them in this my retrospect . From the heights of Henry Vaughan 's verse , I look across a stony region , with a few feeble oases scattered over it , and a hazy green in the distance . It does not soften the dreariness that its stones are all laid in order , that the spaces which should be meadows are skilfully paved .</p>
   <p>Henry Vaughan belongs to the mystical school , but his poetry rules his theories . You find no more of the mystic than the poet can easily govern ; in fact , scarcely more than is necessary to the highest poetry . He develops his mysticism upwards , with relation to his higher nature alone : it blossoms into poetry . His twin-brother Thomas developed his mysticism downwards in the direction of the material sciences — a true effort still , but one in which the danger of ceasing to be true increases with increasing ratio the further it is carried .</p>
   <p>They were born in South Wales in the year 1621 . Thomas was a clergyman ; Henry a doctor of medicine . Both were Royalists , and both suffered in the cause — Thomas by expulsion from his living , Henry by imprisonment . Thomas died soon after the Restoration ; Henry outlived the Revolution .</p>
   <p>Henry Vaughan was then nearly thirty years younger than George Herbert , whom he consciously and intentionally imitates . His art is not comparable to that of Herbert : hence Herbert remains the master ; for it is not the thought that makes the poet ; it is the utterance of that thought in worthy presence of speech . He is careless and somewhat rugged . If he can get his thought dressed , and thus made visible , he does not mind the dress fitting awkwardly , or even being a little out at elbows . And yet he has grander lines and phrases than any in Herbert . He has occasionally a daring success that strikes one with astonishment . In a word , he says more splendid things than Herbert , though he writes inferior poems . His thought is profound and just ; the harmonies in his soul are true ; its artistic and musical ear is defective . His movements are sometimes grand , sometimes awkward . Herbert is always gracious — I use the word as meaning much more than graceful .</p>
   <p>The following poem will instance Vaughan 's fine mysticism and odd embodiment :</p>

   <lg type="poem">
    <head>THE RETREAT .</head>
     <l n="1">Happy those early days when I</l>
     <l n="2">Shined in my angel-infancy !</l>
     <l n="3">Before I understood this place</l>
     <l n="4">Appointed for my second race ,</l>
     <l n="5">Or taught my soul to fancy ought</l>
     <l n="6">But a white , celestial thought ;</l>
     <l n="7">When yet I had not walked above</l>
     <l n="8">A mile or two from my first love ,</l>
     <l n="9">And , looking back , at that short space</l>
     <l n="10">Could see a glimpse of his bright face ;</l>
     <l n="11">When on some gilded cloud or flower</l>
     <l n="12">My gazing soul would dwell an hour ,</l>
     <l n="13">And in those weaker glories spy</l>
     <l n="14">Some shadows of eternity ;</l>
     <l n="15">Before I taught my tongue to wound</l>
     <l n="16">My conscience with a sinful sound ,</l>
     <l n="17">Or had the black art to dispense</l>
     <l n="18">A several sin to every sense ;</l>
     <l n="19">But felt through all this fleshly dress</l>
     <l n="20">Bright shoots of everlastingness .</l>
     <l n="21">O how I long to travel back ,</l>
     <l n="22">And tread again that ancient track !</l>
     <l n="23">That I might once more reach that plain</l>
     <l n="24">Where first I left my glorious train ,</l>
     <l n="25">From whence the enlightened spirit sees</l>
     <l n="26">That shady city of palm-trees .</l>
     <l n="27">But ah ! my soul with too much stay</l>
     <l n="28">Is drunk , and staggers in the way !</l>
     <l n="29">Some men a forward motion love ,</l>
     <l n="30">But I by backward steps would move ;</l>
     <l n="31">And when this dust falls to the urn ,</l>
     <l n="32">In that state I came return .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Let any one who is well acquainted with Wordsworth 's grand ode — that on the Intimations of Immortality — turn his mind to a comparison between that and this : he will find the resemblance remarkable . Whether The Retreat suggested the form of the Ode is not of much consequence , for the Ode is the outcome at once and essence of all Wordsworth 's theories ; and whatever he may have drawn from The Retreat is glorified in the Ode . Still it is interesting to compare them . Vaughan believes with Wordsworth and some other great men that this is not our first stage of existence ; that we are haunted by dim memories of a former state . This belief is not necessary , however , to sympathy with the poem , for whether the present be our first life or no , we have come from God , and bring from him conscience and a thousand godlike gifts .— “ Happy those early days , ” Vaughan begins : “ There was a time , ” begins Wordsworth , “ when the earth seemed apparelled in celestial light . ” “ Before I understood this place , ” continues Vaughan : “ Blank misgivings of a creature moving about in worlds not realized , ” says Wordsworth . “ A white celestial thought , ” says Vaughan : “ Heaven lies about us in our infancy , ” says Wordsworth . “ A mile or two off , I could see his face , ” says Vaughan : “ Trailing clouds of glory do we come , ” says Wordsworth . “ On some gilded cloud or flower , my gazing soul would dwell an hour , ” says Vaughan : “ The hour of splendour in the grass , of glory in the flower , ” says Wordsworth .</p>
   <p>Wordsworth 's poem is the profounder in its philosophy , as well as far the grander and lovelier in its poetry ; but in the moral relation , Vaughan 's poem is the more definite of the two , and gives us in its close , poor as that is compared with the rest of it , just what we feel is wanting in Wordsworth 's — the hope of return to the bliss of childhood . We may be comforted for what we lose by what we gain ; but that is not a recompense large enough to be divine : we want both . Vaughan will be a child again . For the movements of man 's life are in spirals : we go back whence we came , ever returning on our former traces , only upon a higher level , on the next upward coil of the spiral , so that it is a going back and a going forward ever and both at once . Life is , as it were , a constant repentance , or thinking of it again : the childhood of the kingdom takes the place of the childhood of the brain , but comprises all that was lovely in the former delight . The heavenly children will subdue kingdoms , work righteousness , wax valiant in fight , rout the armies of the aliens , merry of heart as when in the nursery of this world they fought their fancied frigates , and defended their toy-battlements .</p>

   <p>Many a true thought comes out by the help of a fancy or half-playful exercise of the thinking power . There is a good deal of such fancy in the following poem , but in the end it rises to the height of the purest and best mysticism . We must not forget that the deepest man can utter , will be but the type or symbol of a something deeper yet , of which he can perceive only a doubtful glimmer . This will serve for general remark upon the mystical mode , as well as for comment explanatory of the close of the poem .</p>

   <p>I do not think that description of the dawn has ever been surpassed . The verse “ All expect some sudden matter , ” is wondrously fine . The water “ dead and in a grave , ” because stagnant , is a true fancy ; and the “ acquainted elsewhere ” of the running stream , is a masterly phrase . I need not point out the symbolism of the poem .</p>
   <p>I do not know a writer , Wordsworth not excepted , who reveals more delight in the visions of Nature than Henry Vaughan . He is a true forerunner of Wordsworth , inasmuch as the latter sets forth with only greater profundity and more art than he , the relations between Nature and Human Nature ; while , on the other hand , he is the forerunner as well of some one that must yet do what Wordsworth has left almost unattempted , namely — set forth the sympathy of Nature with the aspirations of the spirit that is born of God , born again , I mean , in the recognition of the child 's relation to the Father . Both Herbert and Vaughan have thus read Nature , the latter turning many leaves which few besides have turned . In this he has struck upon a deeper and richer lode than even Wordsworth , although he has not wrought it with half his skill . In any history of the development of the love of the present age for Nature , Vaughan , although I fear his influence would be found to have been small as yet , must be represented as the Phosphor of coming dawn . Beside him , Thomson is cold , artistic , and gray : although larger in scope , he is not to be compared with him in sympathetic sight . It is this insight that makes Vaughan a mystic . He can see one thing everywhere , and all things the same — yet each with a thousand sides that radiate crossing lights , even as the airy particles around us . For him everything is the expression of , and points back to , some fact in the Divine Thought . Along the line of every ray he looks towards its radiating centre — the heart of the Maker .</p>
   <p>I could give many instances of Vaughan 's power in reading the heart of Nature , but I may not dwell upon this phase . Almost all the poems I give and have given will afford such .</p>

   <p>There are several amongst his poems lamenting , like this , the death of some dear friend — perhaps his twin-brother , whom he outlived thirty years .</p>
   <p>According to what a man is capable of seeing in nature , he becomes either a man of appliance , a man of science , a mystic , or a poet .</p>
   <p>I must now give two that are simple in thought , construction , and music . The latter ought to be popular , from the nature of its rhythmic movement , and the holy merriment it carries . But in the former , note how the major key of gladness changes in the third stanza to the minor key of aspiration , which has always some sadness in it ; a sadness which deepens to grief in the next stanza at the consciousness of unfitness for Christ 's company , but is lifted by hope almost again to gladness in the last .</p>

   <p>I could not have my book without one word in it of John Bunyan , the tinker , probably the gipsy , who although born only and not made a poet , like his great brother , John Milton , has uttered in prose a wealth of poetic thought . He was born in 1628 , twenty years after Milton . I must not , however , remark on this noble Bohemian of literature and prophecy ; but leaving at length these flowery hills and meadows behind me , step on my way across the desert .— England had now fallen under the influence of France instead of Italy , and that influence has never been for good to our literature , at least . Thence its chief aim grew to be a desirable trimness of speech and logical arrangement of matter — good external qualities purchased at a fearful price with the loss of all that makes poetry precious . The poets of England , with John Dryden at their head , ceased almost for a time to deal with the truths of humanity , and gave themselves to the facts and relations of society . The nation which could recall the family of the Stuarts must necessarily fall into such a decay of spiritual life as should render its literature only respectable at the best , and its religious utterances essentially vulgar . But the decay is gradual .</p>
   <p>Bishop Ken , born in 1637 , is known chiefly by his hymns for the morning and evening , deservedly popular . He has , however , written a great many besides — too many , indeed , for variety or excellence . He seems to have set himself to write them as acts of worship . They present many signs of a perversion of taste which , though not in them so remarkable , rose to a height before long . He annoys us besides by the constant recurrence of certain phrases , one or two of which are not admirable , and by using , in the midst of a simple style , odd Latin words . Here are portions of , I think , one of his best , and good it is .</p>

   <p>Born in 1657 , one of the later English Platonists , John Norris , who , with how many incumbents between I do not know , succeeded George Herbert in the cure of Bemerton , has left a few poems , which would have been better if he had not been possessed with the common admiration for the rough-shod rhythms of Abraham Cowley .</p>

   <p>The old hermits thought to overcome their impulses by retiring from the world : our Platonist has discovered for himself that the world of duty is the only sphere in which they can be combated . Never perhaps is a saint more in danger of giving way to impulse , let it be anger or what it may , than in the moment when he has just descended from this mount of contemplation .</p>
   <p>We find ourselves now in the zone of hymn-writing . From this period , that is , from towards the close of the seventeenth century , a large amount of the fervour of the country finds vent in hymns : they are innumerable . With them the scope of my book would not permit me to deal , even had I inclination thitherward , and knowledge enough to undertake their history . But I am not therefore precluded from presenting any hymn whose literary excellence makes it worthy .</p>
   <p>It is with especial pleasure that I refer to a little book which was once a household treasure in a multitude of families ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 156 ]</span>the Spiritual Songs of John Mason , a clergyman in the county of Buckingham . The date of his birth does not appear to be known , but the first edition of these songs<span type="note_anchor">[ 157 ]</span>was published in 1683 . Dr. Watts was very fond of them : would that he had written with similar modesty of style ! A few of them are still popular in congregational singing . Here is the first in the book :</p>

   <p>In the writings of both we recognize a straight-forwardness of expression equal to that of Wither , and a quaint simplicity of thought and form like that of Herrick ; while the very charm of some of the best lines is their spontaneity . The men have just enough mysticism to afford them homeliest figures for deepest feelings .</p>
   <p>I turn to the accomplished Joseph Addison .</p>
   <p>He was born in 1672 . His religious poems are so well known , and are for the greater part so ordinary in everything but their simplicity of composition , that I should hardly have cared to choose one , had it not been that we owe him much gratitude for what he did , in the reigns of Anne and George I ., to purify the moral taste of the English people at a time when the influence of the clergy was not for elevation , and to teach the love of a higher literature when Milton was little known and less esteemed . Especially are we indebted to him for his modest and admirable criticism of the Paradise Lost in the Spectator .</p>
   <p>Of those few poems to which I have referred , I choose the best known , because it is the best . It has to me a charm for which I can hardly account .</p>
   <p>Yet I imagine I see in it a sign of the poetic times : a flatness of spirit , arising from the evanishment of the mystical element , begins to result in a worship of power . Neither power nor wisdom , though infinite both , could constitute a God worthy of the worship of a human soul ; and the worship of such a God must sink to the level of that fancied divinity . Small wonder is it then that the lyric should now droop its wings and moult the feathers of its praise . I do not say that God 's more glorious attributes are already forgotten , but that the tendency of the Christian lyric is now to laudation of power — and knowledge , a form of the same — as the essential of Godhead . This indicates no recalling of metaphysical questions , such as we have met in foregoing verse , but a decline towards system ; a rising passion — if anything so cold may be called a passion — for the reduction of all things to the forms of the understanding , a declension which has prepared the way for the present worship of science , and its refusal , if not denial , of all that cannot be proved in forms of the intellect .</p>
   <p>The hymn which has led to these remarks is still good , although , like the loveliness of the red and lowering west , it gives sign of a gray and cheerless dawn , under whose dreariness the child will first doubt if his father loves him , and next doubt if he has a father at all , and is not a mere foundling that Nature has lifted from her path .</p>

   <p>The very use of the words spangled and frame seems — to my fancy only , it may be — to indicate a tendency towards the unworthy and theatrical . Yet the second stanza is lovely beyond a doubt ; and the whole is most artistic , although after a tame fashion . Whether indeed the heavenly bodies teach what he says , or whether we should read divinity worthy of the name in them at all , without the human revelation which healed men , I doubt much . That divinity is there — Yes ; that we could read it there without having seen the face of the Son of Man first , I think — No . I do not therefore dare imagine that no revelation dimly leading towards such result glimmered in the hearts of God 's chosen amongst Jews and Gentiles before he came . What I say is , that power and order , although of God , and preparing the way for him , are not his revealers unto men . No doubt King David compares the perfection of God 's law to the glory of the heavens , but he did not learn that perfection from the heavens , but from the law itself , revealed in his own heart through the life-teaching of God . When he had learned it he saw that the heavens were like it .</p>
   <p>To unveil God , only manhood like our own will serve . And he has taken the form of man that he might reveal the manhood in him from awful eternity .</p>

    <head>THE PLAIN .</head>
    <head>But Addison 's tameness is wonderfully lovely beside the fervours of a man of honoured name ,— Dr. Isaac Watts , born in 1674 . The result must be dreadful where fervour will poetize without the aidful restraints of art and modesty . If any man would look upon absurdity in the garb of sobriety , let him search Dryden 's Annus Mirabilis : Dr. Watts 's Lyrics are as bad ; they are fantastic to utter folly . An admiration of “ the incomparable Mr. Cowley ” did the sense of them more injury than the imitation of his rough-cantering ode could do their rhythm . The sentimentalities of Roman Catholic writers towards our Lord and his mother , are not half so offensive as the courtier-like flatteries Dr. Watts offers to the Most High . To say nothing of the irreverence , the vulgarity is offensive . He affords another instance amongst thousands how little the form in which feeling is expressed has to do with the feeling itself . In him the thought is true , the form of its utterance false ; the feeling lovely , the word , often to a degree , repulsive . The ugly web is crossed now and then by a fine line , and even damasked with an occasional good poem : I have found two , and only two , in the whole of his seventy-five Lyrics sacred to Devotion . His objectivity and boldness of thought , and his freedom of utterance , cause us ever and anon to lament that he had not the humility and faith of an artist as well as of a Christian .</head>

   <p>His psalms and hymns are immeasurably better than his lyrics . Dreadful some of them are ; and I doubt if there is one from which we would not wish stanzas , lines , and words absent . But some are very fine . The man who could write such verses as these ought not to have written as he has written :—</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Had I a glance of thee , my God ,</l>
     <l n="2">Kingdoms and men would vanish soon ;</l>

     <l n="4">As a dim candle dies at noon .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">Then they might fight and rage and rave :</l>
     <l n="6">I should perceive the noise no more</l>
     <l n="7">Than we can hear a shaking leaf</l>
     <l n="8">While rattling thunders round us roar .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Some of his hymns will be sung , I fancy , so long as men praise God together ; for most heartily do I grant that of all hymns I know he has produced the best for public use ; but these bear a very small proportion indeed to the mass of his labour . We cannot help wishing that he had written about the twentieth part . We could not have too much of his best , such as this :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Be earth with all her scenes withdrawn ;</l>
     <l n="2">Let noise and vanity begone :</l>
     <l n="3">In secret silence of the mind</l>
     <l n="4">My heaven , and there my God , I find ;</l>
   </lg>
   <p>but there is no occasion for the best to be so plentiful : a little of it will go a great way . And as our best moments are so few , how could any man write six hundred religious poems , and produce quality in proportion to quantity save in an inverse ratio ?</p>
   <p>Dr. Thomas Parnell , the well-known poet , a clergyman , born in Dublin in 1679 , has written a few religious verses . The following have a certain touch of imagination and consequent grace , which distinguishes them above the swampy level of the time .</p>

   <p>Many long and elaborate religious poems I have not even mentioned , because I cannot favour extracts , especially in heroic couplets or blank verse . They would only make my book heavy , and destroy the song-idea . I must here pass by one of the best of such poems , The Complaint , or Night Thoughts of Dr. Young ; nor is there anything else of his I care to quote .</p>
   <p>I must give just one poem of Pope , born in 1688 , the year of the Revolution . The flamboyant style of his Messiah is to me detestable : nothing can be more unlike the simplicity of Christianity . All such , equally with those by whatever hand that would be religious by being miserable , I reject at once , along with all that are merely commonplace religious exercises . But this at least is very unlike the rest of Pope 's compositions : it is as simple in utterance as it is large in scope and practical in bearing . The name Jove may be unpleasant to some ears : it is to mine — not because it is the name given to their deity by men who had had little outward revelation , but because of the associations which the wanton poets , not the good philosophers , have gathered about it . Here let it stand , as Pope meant it , for one of the names of the Unknown God .</p>

   <p>And now we come upon a strange little well in the desert . Few flowers indeed shine upon its brink , and it flows with a somewhat unmusical ripple : it is a well of the water of life notwithstanding , for its song tells of the love and truth which are the grand power of God .</p>
   <p>John Byrom , born in Manchester in the year 1691 , a man whose strength of thought and perception of truth greatly surpassed his poetic gifts , yet delighted so entirely in the poetic form that he wrote much and chiefly in it . After leaving Cambridge , he gained his livelihood for some time by teaching a shorthand of his own invention , but was so distinguished as a man of learning generally that he was chosen an F. R. S . in 1723 . Coming under the influence , probably through William Law , of the writings of Jacob Böhme , the marvellous shoemaker of Görlitz in Silesia , who lived in the time of our Shakspere , and heartily adopting many of his views , he has left us a number of religious poems , which are seldom so sweet in music as they are profound in the metaphysics of religion . Here we have yet again a mystical thread running radiant athwart both warp and woof of our poetic web : the mystical thinker will ever be found the reviver of religious poetry ; and although some of the seed had come from afar both in time and space , Byrom 's verse is of indigenous growth . Much of the thought of the present day will be found in his verses . Here is a specimen of his metrical argumentation . It is taken from a series of Meditations for every Day in Passion Week .</p>

   <p>CHAPTER XX .</p>
   <p>THE ROOTS OF THE HILLS .</p>
   <p>In the poems of James Thomson , we find two hymns to the God of Creation — one in blank verse , the other in stanzas . They are of the kind which from him we should look for . The one in blank verse , which is as an epilogue to his great poem , The Seasons , I prefer .</p>
   <p>We owe much to Thomson . Born ( in Scotland ) in the year 1700 , he is the leading priest in a solemn procession to find God — not in the laws by which he has ordered his creation , but in the beauty which is the outcome of those laws . I do not say there is much of the relation of man to nature in his writing ; but thitherward it tends . He is true about the outsides of God ; and in Thomson we begin to feel that the revelation of God as meaning and therefore being the loveliness of nature , is about to be recognized . I do not say — to change my simile — that he is the first visible root in our literature whence we can follow the outburst of the flowers and foliage of our delight in nature : I could show a hundred fibres leading from the depths of our old literature up to the great root . Nor is it surprising that , with his age about him , he too should be found tending to magnify , not God 's Word , but his works , above all his name : we have beauty for loveliness ; beneficence for tenderness . I have wondered whether one great part of Napoleon 's mission was not to wake people from this idolatry of the power of God to the adoration of his love .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">The Hymn holds a kind of middle place between the Morning Hymn in the</l>
     <l n="2">5th Book of the Paradise Lost and the Hymn in the Vale of Chamouni .</l>
     <l n="3">It would be interesting and instructive to compare the three ; but we have</l>
     <l n="4">not time . Thomson has been influenced by Milton , and Coleridge by both .</l>
     <l n="5">We have delight in Milton ; art in Thomson ; heart , including both , in</l>
     <l n="6">Coleridge .</l>

   <p>The worship of intellectual power in laws and inventions is the main delight of the song ; not the living presence of creative love , which never sings its own praises , but spends itself in giving . Still , although there has passed away a glory from the world of song , although the fervour of childlike worship has vanished for a season , there are signs in these verses of a new dawn of devotion . Even the exclusive and therefore blind worship of science will , when it has turned the coil of the ascending spiral , result in a new song to “ him that made heaven and earth and the sea and the fountains of waters . ” But first , for a long time , the worship of power will go on . There is one sonnet by Kirke White , eighty-five years younger than Thomson , which is quite pagan in its mode of glorifying the power of the Deity .</p>
   <p>But about the same time when Thomson 's Seasons was published , which was in 1730 , the third year of George II ., that life which had burned on in the hidden corners of the church in spite of the worldliness and sensuality of its rulers , began to show a flame destined to enlarge and spread until it should have lighted up the mass with an outburst of Christian faith and hope . I refer to the movement called Methodism , in the midst of which , at an early stage of its history , arose the directing energies of John Wesley , a man sent of God to deepen at once and purify its motive influences . What he and his friends taught , would , I presume , in its essence , amount mainly to this : that acquiescence in the doctrines of the church is no fulfilment of duty — or anything , indeed , short of an obedient recognition of personal relation to God , who has sent every man the message of present salvation in his Son . A new life began to bud and blossom from the dry stem of the church . The spirit moved upon the waters of feeling , and the new undulation broke on the shores of thought in an outburst of new song . For while John Wesley roused the hearts of the people to sing , his brother Charles put songs in their mouths .</p>
   <p>I do not say that many of these songs possess much literary merit , but many of them are real lyrics : they have that essential element , song , in them . The following , however , is a very fine poem . That certain expressions in it may not seem offensive , it is necessary to keep the allegory of Jacob and the Angel in full view — even better in view , perhaps , than the writer does himself .</p>

   <p>It seems to me that the art with which his very difficult end in the management of the allegory is reached , is admirable . I have omitted three stanzas .</p>
   <p>I cannot give much from William Cowper . His poems — graceful always , and often devout even when playful — have few amongst them that are expressly religious , while the best of his hymns are known to every reader of such . Born in 1731 , he was greatly influenced by the narrow theology that prevailed in his circle ; and most of his hymns are marred by the exclusiveness which belonged to the system and not to the man . There is little of it in the following :—</p>

     <l n="1">Far from the world , O Lord , I flee ,</l>
     <l n="2">From strife and tumult far ;</l>

   <p>Sad as was Cowper 's history , with the vapours of a low insanity , if not always filling his garden , yet ever brooding on the hill-tops of his horizon , he was , through his faith in God , however darkened by the introversions of a neat , poverty-stricken theology , yet able to lead his life to the end . It is delightful to discover that , when science , which is the anatomy of nature , had poisoned the theology of the country , in creating a demand for clean-cut theory in infinite affairs , the loveliness and truth of the countenance of living nature could calm the mind which this theology had irritated to the very borders of madness , and give a peace and hope which the man was altogether right in attributing to the Spirit of God . How many have been thus comforted , who knew not , like Wordsworth , the immediate channel of their comfort ; or even , with Cowper , recognized its source ! God gives while men sleep .</p>
   <p>CHAPTER XXI .</p>
   <p>THE NEW VISION .</p>
   <p>William Blake , the painter of many strange and fantastic but often powerful — sometimes very beautiful pictures — wrote poems of an equally remarkable kind . Some of them are as lovely as they are careless , while many present a curious contrast in the apparent incoherence of the simplest language . He was born in 1757 , towards the close of the reign of George II . Possibly if he had been sent to an age more capable of understanding him , his genius would not have been tempted to utter itself with such a wildness as appears to indicate hopeless indifference to being understood . We cannot tell sometimes whether to attribute the bewilderment the poems cause in us to a mysticism run wild , or to regard it as the reflex of madness in the writer . Here is a lyrical gem , however , although not cut with mathematical precision .</p>

   <p>The following is full of truth most quaintly expressed , with a homeliness of phrase quite delicious . It is one of the Songs of Innocence , published , as we learn from Gilchrist 's Life of Blake , in the year 1789 . They were engraved on copper with illustrations by Blake , and printed and bound by his wife . When we consider them in respect of the time when they were produced , we find them marvellous for their originality and simplicity .</p>

   <p>A supreme regard for science , and the worship of power , go hand in hand : that knowledge is power has been esteemed the grandest incitement to study . Yet the antidote to the disproportionate cultivation of science , is simply power in its crude form — breaking out , that is , as brute force . When science , isolated and glorified , has produced a contempt , not only for vulgar errors , but for the truths which are incapable of scientific proof , then , as we see in the French Revolution , the wild beast in man breaks from its den , and chaos returns . But all the noblest minds in Europe looked for grand things in the aurora of this uprising of the people . To the terrible disappointment that followed , we are indebted for the training of Wordsworth to the priesthood of nature 's temple . So was he possessed with the hope of a coming deliverance for the nations , that he spent many months in France during the Revolution . At length he was forced to seek safety at home . Dejected even to hopelessness for a time , he believed in nothing . How could there be a God that ruled in the earth when such a rising sun of promise was permitted to set in such a sea ! But for man to worship himself is a far more terrible thing than that blood should flow like water : the righteous plague of God allowed things to go as they would for a time . But the power of God came upon Wordsworth — I cannot say as it had never come before , but with an added insight which made him recognize in the fresh gift all that he had known and felt of such in the past . To him , as to Cowper , the benignities of nature restored peace and calmness and hope — sufficient to enable him to look back and gather wisdom . He was first troubled , then quieted , and then taught . Such presence of the Father has been an infinitely more active power in the redemption of men than men have yet become capable of perceiving . The divine expressions of Nature , that is , the face of the Father therein visible , began to heal the plague which the worship of knowledge had bred . And the power of her teaching grew from comfort to prayer , as will be seen in the poem I shall give . Higher than all that Nature can do in the way of direct lessoning , is the production of such holy moods as result in hope , conscience of duty , and supplication . Those who have never felt it have to be told there is in her such a power — yielding to which , the meek inherit the earth .</p>

   <p>Although I have mentioned Wordsworth before Coleridge because he was two years older , yet Coleridge had much to do with the opening of Wordsworth 's eyes to such visions ; as , indeed , more than any man in our times , he has opened the eyes of the English people to see wonderful things . There is little of a directly religious kind in his poetry ; yet we find in him what we miss in Wordsworth , an inclined plane from the revelation in nature to the culminating revelation in the Son of Man . Somehow , I say , perhaps because we find it in his prose , we feel more of this in Coleridge 's verse .</p>
   <p>Coleridge is a sage , and Wordsworth is a seer ; yet when the sage sees , that is , when , like the son of Beor , he falls into a trance having his eyes open , or , when feeling and sight are one and philosophy is in abeyance , the ecstasy is even loftier in Coleridge than in Wordsworth . In their highest moods they seem almost to change places — Wordsworth to become sage , and Coleridge seer . Perhaps the grandest hymn of praise which man , the mouth-piece of Nature , utters for her , is the hymn of Mont Blanc .</p>

   <p>Next the father let me place the gifted son , Hartley Coleridge . He was born in 1796 , and died in 1849 . Strange , wayward , and in one respect faulty , as his life was , his poetry — strange , and exceedingly wayward too — is often very lovely . The following sonnet is all I can find room for :—</p>
   <p>“ SHE LOVED MUCH . ”</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">She sat and wept beside his feet . The weight</l>
     <l n="2">Of sin oppressed her heart ; for all the blame ,</l>
     <l n="3">And the poor malice of the worldly shame ,</l>
     <l n="4">To her was past , extinct , and out of date ;</l>
     <l n="5">Only the sin remained — the leprous state .</l>
     <l n="6">She would be melted by the heat of love ,</l>
     <l n="7">By fires far fiercer than are blown to prove</l>
     <l n="8">And purge the silver ore adulterate .</l>
     <l n="9">She sat and wept , and with her untressed hair</l>
     <l n="10">Still wiped the feet she was so blest to touch ;</l>
     <l n="11">And he wiped off the soiling of despair</l>
     <l n="12">From her sweet soul , because she loved so much .</l>
     <l n="13">I am a sinner , full of doubts and fears :</l>
     <l n="14">Make me a humble thing of love and tears .</l>

   <p>THE FERVOUR OF THE IMPLICIT . INSIGHT OF THE HEART .</p>
   <p>The late Dean Milman , born in 1791 , best known by his very valuable labours in history , may be taken as representing a class of writers in whom the poetic fire is ever on the point , and only on the point , of breaking into a flame . His composition is admirable — refined , scholarly , sometimes rich and even gorgeous in expression — yet lacking that radiance of the unutterable to which the loftiest words owe their grandest power . Perhaps the best representative of his style is the hymn on the Incarnation , in his dramatic poem , The Fall of Jerusulem . But as an extract it is tolerably known . I prefer giving one from his few Hymns for Church Service .</p>

   <p>The Christian Year of the Rev . John Keble ( born in 1800 ) is perhaps better known in England than any other work of similar church character . I must confess I have never been able to enter into the enthusiasm of its admirers . Excellent , both in regard of their literary and religious merits , true in feeling and thorough in finish , the poems always remind me of Berlin work in iron — hard and delicate . Here is a portion of one of the best of them .</p>

   <p>There are here some indications of that strong reaction of the present century towards ancient forms of church life . This reaction seems to me a further consequence of that admiration of power of which I have spoken . For , finding the progress of discovery in the laws of nature constantly bring an assurance most satisfactory to the intellect , men began to demand a similar assurance in other matters ; and whatever department of human thought could not be subjected to experiment or did not admit of logical proof began to be regarded with suspicion . The highest realms of human thought — where indeed only grand conviction , and that the result not of research , but of obedience to the voice within , can be had — came to be by such regarded as regions where , no scientific assurance being procurable , it was only to his loss that a man should go wandering : the whole affair was unworthy of him . And if there be no guide of humanity but the intellect , and nothing worthy of its regard but what that intellect can isolate and describe in the forms peculiar to its operations ,— that is , if a man has relations to nothing beyond his definition , is not a creature of the immeasurable ,— then these men are right . But there have appeared along with them other thinkers who could not thus be satisfied — men who had in their souls a hunger which the neatest laws of nature could not content , who could not live on chemistry , or mathematics , or even on geology , without the primal law of their many dim-dawning wonders — that is , the Being , if such there might be , who thought their laws first and then embodied them in a world of aeonian growth . These indeed seek law likewise , but a perfect law — a law they can believe perfect beyond the comprehension of powers of whose imperfection they are too painfully conscious . They feel in their highest moments a helplessness that drives them to search after some Power with a heart deeper than his power , who cares for the troubled creatures he has made . But still under the influence of that faithless hunger for intellectual certainty , they look about and divide into two parties : both would gladly receive the reported revelation in Jesus , the one if they could have evidence enough from without , the other if they could only get rid of the difficulties it raises within . I am aware that I distinguish in the mass , and that both sides would be found more or less influenced by the same difficulties — but more and less , and therefore thus classified by the driving predominance . Those of the one party , then , finding no proof to be had but that in testimony , and anxious to have all they can — delighting too in a certain holy wilfulness of intellectual self-immolation , accept the testimony in the mass , and become Roman Catholics . Nor is it difficult to see how they then find rest . It is not the dogma , but the contact with Christ the truth , with Christ the man , which the dogma , in pacifying the troubles of the intellect — if only by a soporific , has aided them in reaching , that gives them peace : it is the truth itself that makes them free .</p>
   <p>The worshippers of science will themselves allow , that when they cannot gain observations enough to satisfy them upon any point in which a law of nature is involved , they must , if possible , institute experiments . I say therefore to those whose observation has not satisfied them concerning the phenomenon Christianity ,— “ Where is your experiment ? Why do you not thus try the utterance claiming to be the law of life ? Call it a hypothesis , and experiment upon it . Carry into practice , well justified of your conscience , the words which the Man spoke , for therein he says himself lies the possibility of your acceptance of his mission ; and if , after reasonable time thus spent , you are not yet convinced enough to give testimony — I will not annoy you by saying to facts , but — to conviction , I think neither will you be ready to abandon the continuous experiment . ” These Roman Catholics have thus met with Jesus , come into personal contact with him : by the doing of what he tells us , and by nothing else , are they blessed . What if their theories show to me like a burning of the temple and a looking for the god in the ashes ? They know in whom they have believed . And if some of us think we have a more excellent way , we shall be blessed indeed if the result be no less excellent than in such men as Faber , Newman , and Aubrey de Vere . No man needs be afraid that to speak the truth concerning such will hasten the dominance of alien and oppressive powers ; the truth is free , and to be just is to be strong . Should the time come again when Liberty is in danger , those who have defended the truth even in her adversaries , if such there be , will be found the readiest to draw the sword for her , and , hating not , yet smite for the liberty to do even them justice . To give the justice we claim for ourselves is , if there be a Christ , the law of Christ , to obey which is eternally better than truest theory .</p>
   <p>I should like to give many of the hymns of Dr. Faber . Some of them are grand , others very lovely , and some , of course , to my mind considerably repulsive . He seems to me to go wrong nowhere in originating — he produces nothing unworthy except when he reproduces what he never could have entertained but for the pressure of acknowledged authority . Even such things , however , he has enclosed in pearls , as the oyster its incommoding sand-grains .</p>
   <p>His hymn on The Greatness of God is profound ; that on The Will of God is very wise ; that to The God of my Childhood is full of quite womanly tenderness : all are most simple in speech , reminding us in this respect of John Mason . In him , no doubt , as in all of his class , we find traces of that sentimentalism in the use of epithets — small words , as distinguished from homely , applied to great things — of which I have spoken more than once ; but criticism is not to be indulged in the reception of great gifts — of such a gift as this , for instance :—</p>

   <p>How easily his words flow , even when he is saying the deepest things ! The poem is full of the elements of the finest mystical metaphysics , and yet there is no effort in their expression . The tendency to find God beyond , rather than in our daily human conditions , is discernible ; but only as a tendency .</p>
   <p>What a pity that the sects are so slow to become acquainted with the grand best in each other !</p>
   <p>I do not find in Dr. Newman either a depth or a precision equal to that of Dr. Faber . His earlier poems indicate a less healthy condition of mind . His Dream of Gerontius is , however , a finer , as more ambitious poem than any of Faber 's . In my judgment there are weak passages in it , with others of real grandeur . But I am perfectly aware of the difficulty , almost impossibility , of doing justice to men from some of whose forms of thought I am greatly repelled , who creep from the sunshine into every ruined archway , attracted by the brilliance with which the light from its loophole glows in its caverned gloom , and the hope of discovering within it the first steps of a stair winding up into the blue heaven . I apologize for the unavoidable rudeness of a critic who would fain be honest if he might ; and I humbly thank all such as Dr. Newman , whose verses , revealing their saintship , make us long to be holier men .</p>
   <p>Of his , as of Faber 's , I have room for no more than one . It was written off Sardinia .</p>

     <l n="4">Thus , self-deceivers , filled with pride alway ,</l>
     <l n="5">Reluctant homage to the good ye pay ,</l>
     <l n="6">Mingled with scorn like poison sucked from flowers —</l>
     <l n="7">Revere the humble ; godlike are their powers :</l>
     <l n="8">No mendicants for praise of men are they .</l>
     <l n="9">The child who prays in faith “ Thy will be done ”</l>
     <l n="10">Is blended with that Will Supreme which moves</l>
     <l n="11">A wilderness of worlds by Thought untrod ;</l>
     <l n="12">He shares the starry sceptre , and the throne :</l>
     <l n="13">The man who as himself his neighbour loves</l>
     <l n="14">Looks down on all things with the eyes of God !</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Is it a fancy that , in the midst of all this devotion and lovely thought , I hear the mingled mournful tone of such as have cut off a right hand and plucked out a right eye , which had not caused them to offend ? This is tenfold better than to have spared offending members ; but the true Christian ambition is to fill the divine scheme of humanity — abridging nothing , ignoring nothing , denying nothing , calling nothing unclean , but burning everything a thank-offering in the flame of life upon the altar of absolute devotion to the Father and Saviour of men . We must not throw away half his gifts , that we may carry the other half in both hands to his altar .</p>
   <p>But sacred fervour is confined to no sect . Here it is of the profoundest , and uttered with a homely tenderness equal to that of the earliest writers . Mrs. Browning , the princess of poets , was no partisan . If my work were mainly critical , I should feel bound to remark upon her false theory of English rhyme , and her use of strange words . That she is careless too in her general utterance I cannot deny ; but in idea she is noble , and in phrase magnificent . Some of her sonnets are worthy of being ranged with the best in our language — those of Milton and Wordsworth .</p>

   <p>Gladly would I next give myself to the exposition of several of the poems of her husband , Robert Browning , especially the Christmas Eve and Easter Day ; in the first of which he sets forth in marvellous rhymes the necessity both for widest sympathy with the varied forms of Christianity , and for individual choice in regard to communion ; in the latter , what it is to choose the world and lose the life . But this would take many pages , and would be inconsistent with the plan of my book .</p>
   <p>When I have given two precious stanzas , most wise as well as most lyrical and lovely , from the poems of our honoured Charles Kingsley , I shall turn to the other of the classes into which the devout thinkers of the day have divided .</p>

   <p>Surely these last , who have not accepted tradition in the mass , who believe that we must , as our Lord demanded of the Jews , of our own selves judge what is right , because therein his spirit works with our spirit ,— worship the Truth not less devotedly than they who rejoice in holy tyranny over their intellects .</p>
   <p>CHAPTER XXIII .</p>
   <p>THE QUESTIONING FERVOUR .</p>
   <p>And now I turn to the other class — that which , while the former has fled to tradition for refuge from doubt , sets its face towards the spiritual east , and in prayer and sorrow and hope looks for a dawn — the noble band of reverent doubters — as unlike those of the last century who scoffed , as those of the present who pass on the other side . They too would know ; but they know enough already to know further , that it is from the hills and not from the mines their aid must come . They know that a perfect intellectual proof would leave them doubting all the same ; that their high questions cannot be answered to the intellect alone , for their whole nature is the questioner ; that the answers can only come as questioners and their questions grow towards them . Hence , growing hope , blossoming ever and anon into the white flower of confidence , is their answer as yet ; their hope — the Beatific Vision — the happy-making sight , as Milton renders the word of the mystics .</p>
   <p>It is strange how gentle a certain large class of the priesthood will be with those who , believing there is a God , find it hard to trust him , and how fierce with those who , unable , from the lack of harmony around and in them , to say they are sure there is a God , would yet , could they find him , trust him indeed . “ Ah , but , ” answer such of the clergy and their followers , “ you want a God of your own making . ” “ Certainly , ” the doubters reply , “ we do not want a God of your making : that would be to turn the universe into a hell , and you into its torturing demons . We want a God like that man whose name is so often on your lips , but whose spirit you understand so little — so like him that he shall be the bread of life to all our hunger — not that hunger only already satisfied in you , who take the limit of your present consciousness for that of the race , and say , ‘ This is all the world needs : ’ we know the bitterness of our own hearts , and your incapacity for intermeddling with its joy . We</p>
   <p>have another mountain-range , from whence Bursteth a sun unutterably bright ;</p>
   <p>nor for us only , but for you also , who will not have the truth except it come to you in a system authorized of man . ”</p>
   <p>I have attributed a general utterance to these men , widely different from each other as I know they are .</p>
   <p>Here is a voice from one of them , Arthur Hugh Clough , who died in 1861 , well beloved . It follows upon two fine poems , called The Questioning Spirit , and Bethesda , in which is represented the condition of many of the finest minds of the present century . Let us receive it as spoken by one in the foremost ranks of these doubters , men reviled by their brethren who dare not doubt for fear of offending the God to whom they attribute their own jealousy . But God is assuredly pleased with those who will neither lie for him , quench their dim vision of himself , nor count that his mind which they would despise in a man of his making .</p>

   <p>Here is another from one who will not be offended if I class him with this school — the finest of critics as one of the most finished of poets — Matthew Arnold . Only my reader must remember that of none of my poets am I free to choose that which is most characteristic : I have the scope of my volume to restrain me .</p>

     <l n="10">With eye suffused but heart inspired true ,</l>
     <l n="11">On those walls subterranean , where she hid</l>

   <p>Of these writers , Tennyson is the foremost : he has written the poem of the hoping doubters , the poem of our age , the grand minor organ-fugue of In Memoriam . It is the cry of the bereaved Psyche into the dark infinite after the vanished Love . His friend is nowhere in his sight , and God is silent . Death , God 's final compulsion to prayer , in its dread , its gloom , its utter stillness , its apparent nothingness , urges the cry . Meanings over the dead are mingled with profoundest questionings of philosophy , the signs of nature , and the story of Jesus , while now and then the star of the morning , bright Phosphor , flashes a few rays through the shifting cloudy dark . And if the sun has not arisen on the close of the book , yet the Aurora of the coming dawn gives light enough to make the onward journey possible and hopeful : who dares say that he walks in the full light ? that the counsels of God are to him not a matter of faith , but of vision ?</p>
   <p>Bewildered in the perplexities of nature 's enigmas , and driven by an awful pain of need , Tennyson betakes himself to the God of nature , thus :</p>

   <p>I have thus traced — how slightly !— the course of the religious poetry of England , from simple song , lovingly regardful of sacred story and legend , through the chant of philosophy , to the full-toned lyric of adoration . I have shown how the stream sinks in the sands of an evil taste generated by the worship of power and knowledge , and that a new growth of the love of nature — beauty counteracting not contradicting science — has led it by a fair channel back to the simplicities of faith in some , and to a holy questioning in others ; the one class having for its faith , the other for its hope , that the heart of the Father is a heart like ours , a heart that will receive into its noon the song that ascends from the twilighted hearts of his children .</p>
   <p>Gladly would I have prayed for the voices of many more of the singers of our country 's psalms . Especially do I regret the arrival of the hour , because of the voices of living men and women . But the time is over and gone . The twilight has already embrowned the gray glooms of the cathedral arches , and is driving us forth to part at the door .</p>
   <p>But the singers will yet sing on to him that hath ears to hear . When he returns to seek them , the shadowy door will open to his touch , the long-drawn aisles receding will guide his eye to the carven choir , and there they still stand , the sweet singers , content to repeat ancient psalm and new song to the prayer of the humblest whose heart would join in England 's Antiphon .</p>
   <p>THE END .</p>

The meaning is , however , plain enough .<span type="note_anchor">[ 67 ]</span>“ The very blessing the soul needed . ”<span type="note_anchor">[ 68 ]</span>An old English game , still in use in Scotland and America , but vanishing before cricket .<span type="note_anchor">[ 69 ]</span>Silly means innocent , and therefore blessed ; ignorant of evil , and in so far helpless . It is easy to see how affection came to apply it to idiots . It is applied to the ox and ass in the next stanza , and is often an epithet of shepherds .<span type="note_anchor">[ 70 ]</span>See Poems by Sir Henry Wotton and others . Edited by the Rev . John Hannah .<span type="note_anchor">[ 71 ]</span>“ Know thyself . ”<span type="note_anchor">[ 72 ]</span>“ And I have grown their map . ”<span type="note_anchor">[ 73 ]</span>The guilt of Adam 's first sin , supposed by the theologians of Dr. Donne 's time to be imputed to Adam 's descendants .<span type="note_anchor">[ 74 ]</span>The past tense : ran .<span type="note_anchor">[ 75 ]</span>Their door to enter into sin — by his example .<span type="note_anchor">[ 76 ]</span>He was sent by James I. to assist an embassy to the Elector Palatine , who had married his daughter Elizabeth .<span type="note_anchor">[ 77 ]</span>He had lately lost his wife , for whom he had a rare love .<span type="note_anchor">[ 78 ]</span>“ If they know us not by intuition , but by judging from circumstances and signs . ”<span type="note_anchor">[ 79 ]</span>“ With most willingness . ”<span type="note_anchor">[ 80 ]</span>“ Art proud . ”<span type="note_anchor">[ 81 ]</span>A strange use of the word ; but it evidently means recovered , and has some analogy with the French repasser .<span type="note_anchor">[ 82 ]</span>To understood : to sweeten .<span type="note_anchor">[ 83 ]</span>He plays upon the astrological terms , houses and schemes . The astrologers divided the heavens into twelve houses ; and the diagrams by which they represented the relative positions of the heavenly bodies , they called schemes .<span type="note_anchor">[ 84 ]</span>The tree of knowledge .<span type="note_anchor">[ 85 ]</span>Dyce , following Seward , substitutes curse .<span type="note_anchor">[ 86 ]</span>A glimmer of that Platonism of which , happily , we have so much more in the seventeenth century .<span type="note_anchor">[ 87 ]</span>Should this be “ in fees ; ” that is , in acknowledgment of his feudal sovereignty ?<span type="note_anchor">[ 88 ]</span>Warm is here elongated , almost treated as a dissyllable .<span type="note_anchor">[ 89 ]</span>“ He ought not to be forsaken : whoever weighs the matter rightly , will come to this conclusion . ”<span type="note_anchor">[ 90 ]</span>The Eridan is the Po .— As regards classical allusions in connexion with sacred things , I would remind my reader of the great reverence our ancestors had for the classics , from the influence they had had in reviving the literature of the country .— I need hardly remind him of the commonly-received fancy that the swan does sing once — just as his death draws nigh . Does this come from the legend of Cycnus changed into a swan while lamenting the death of his friend Phaeton ? or was that legend founded on the yet older fancy ? The glorious bird looks as if he ought to sing .<span type="note_anchor">[ 91 ]</span>The poet refers to the singing of the hymn before our Lord went to the garden by the brook Cedron .<span type="note_anchor">[ 92 ]</span>The construction is obscure just from the insertion of the to before breathe , where it ought not to be after the verb hear . The poet does not mean that he delights to hear that voice more than to breathe gentle airs , but more than to hear gentle airs ( to ) breathe . To hear , understood , governs all the infinitives that follow ; among the rest , the winds ( to ) chide .<span type="note_anchor">[ 93 ]</span>Rut is used for the sound of the tide in Cheshire . ( See Halliwell 's Dictionary . ) Does rutty mean roaring ? or does it describe the deep , rugged shores of the Jordan ?<span type="note_anchor">[ 94 ]</span>A monosyllable , contracted afterwards into bloom .<span type="note_anchor">[ 95 ]</span>Willows .<span type="note_anchor">[ 96 ]</span>Groom originally means just a man . It was a word much used when pastoral poetry was the fashion . Spenser has herd-grooms in his Shepherd 's Calendar . This last is what it means here : shepherds .<span type="note_anchor">[ 97 ]</span>Obtain , save .<span type="note_anchor">[ 98 ]</span>Equivalent to “ What are those hands of yours for ? ”<span type="note_anchor">[ 99 ]</span>He was but thirty-nine when he died .<span type="note_anchor">[ 100 ]</span>To rhyme with pray in the second line .<span type="note_anchor">[ 101 ]</span>Bunch of flowers . He was thinking of Aaron 's rod , perhaps .<span type="note_anchor">[ 102 ]</span>To correspond to that of Christ .<span type="note_anchor">[ 103 ]</span>Again a touch of holy humour : to match his Master 's predestination , he will contrive something three years beforehand , with an if .<span type="note_anchor">[ 104 ]</span>The here in the preceding line means his book ; hence the thy book is antithetical .<span type="note_anchor">[ 105 ]</span>Concent is a singing together , or harmoniously .<span type="note_anchor">[ 106 ]</span>Music depends all on proportions .<span type="note_anchor">[ 107 ]</span>The diapason is the octave . Therefore “ all notes true . ” See note 2 , p. 205 .<span type="note_anchor">[ 108 ]</span>An intransitive verb : he was wont .<span type="note_anchor">[ 109 ]</span>The birds called halcyons were said to build their nests on the water , and , while they were brooding , to keep it calm .<span type="note_anchor">[ 110 ]</span>The morning star .<span type="note_anchor">[ 111 ]</span>The God of shepherds especially , but the God of all nature — the All in all , for Pan means the All .<span type="note_anchor">[ 112 ]</span>Milton here uses the old Ptolemaic theory of a succession of solid crystal concentric spheres , in which the heavenly bodies were fixed , and which revolving carried these with them . The lowest or innermost of these spheres was that of the moon . “ The hollow round of Cynthia 's seat ” is , therefore , this sphere in which the moon sits .<span type="note_anchor">[ 113 ]</span>That cannot be expressed or described .<span type="note_anchor">[ 114 ]</span>By hinges he means the axis of the earth , on which it turns as on a hinge . The origin of hinge is hang . It is what anything hangs on .<span type="note_anchor">[ 115 ]</span>This is an apostrophe to the nine spheres ( see former note ) , which were believed by the ancients to send forth in their revolutions a grand harmony , too loud for mortals to hear . But no music of the lower region can make up full harmony without the bass of heaven 's organ . The music of the spheres was to Milton the embodiment of the theory of the universe . He uses the symbol often .<span type="note_anchor">[ 116 ]</span>Consort is the right word scientifically . It means the fitting together of sounds according to their nature . Concert , however , is not wrong . It is even more poetic than consort , for it means a striving together , which is the idea of all peace : the strife is together , and not of one against the other . All harmony is an ordered , a divine strife . In the contest of music , every tone restrains its foot and bows its head to the rest in holy dance .<span type="note_anchor">[ 117 ]</span>Symphony is here used for chorus , and quite correctly ; for symphony is a voicing together . To this symphony of the angels the spheres and the heavenly organ are the accompaniment .<span type="note_anchor">[ 118 ]</span>Die of the music .<span type="note_anchor">[ 119 ]</span>Not merely swings , but lashes about .<span type="note_anchor">[ 120 ]</span>Full of folds or coils .<span type="note_anchor">[ 121 ]</span>The legend concerning this cessation of the oracles associates it with the Crucifixion . Milton in The Nativity represents it as the consequence of the very presence of the infant Saviour . War and lying are banished together .<span type="note_anchor">[ 122 ]</span>The genius is the local god , the god of the place as a place .<span type="note_anchor">[ 123 ]</span>The Lars were the protecting spirits of the ancestors of the family ; the Lemures were evil spirits , spectres , or bad ghosts . But the notions were somewhat indefinite .<span type="note_anchor">[ 124 ]</span>Flamen was the word used for priest when the Romans spoke of the priest of any particular divinity . Hence the peculiar power in the last line of the stanza .<span type="note_anchor">[ 125 ]</span>Jupiter Ammon , worshipped in Libya , in the north of Africa , under the form of a goat . “ He draws in his horn . ”<span type="note_anchor">[ 126 ]</span>The Syrian Adonis .<span type="note_anchor">[ 127 ]</span>Frightful , horrible , as , a grisly bear .<span type="note_anchor">[ 128 ]</span>Isis , Orus , Anubis , and Osiris , all Egyptian divinities — the last worshipped in the form of a bull .<span type="note_anchor">[ 129 ]</span>No rain falls in Egypt .<span type="note_anchor">[ 130 ]</span>Last-born : the star in the east .<span type="note_anchor">[ 131 ]</span>Bright-armoured .<span type="note_anchor">[ 132 ]</span>Ready for what service may arise .<span type="note_anchor">[ 133 ]</span>The with we should now omit , for when we use it we mean the opposite of what is meant here .<span type="note_anchor">[ 134 ]</span>It is the light of the soul going out from the eyes , as certainly as the light of the world coming in at the eyes that makes things seen .<span type="note_anchor">[ 135 ]</span>The action by which a body attacked collects force by opposition .<span type="note_anchor">[ 136 ]</span>Cut roughly through .<span type="note_anchor">[ 137 ]</span>Intransitively used .

The joy of seeing the Saviour was stolen because they gained it in the absence of the sun !<span type="note_anchor">[ 141 ]</span>A trisyllable .<span type="note_anchor">[ 142 ]</span>His garland .<span type="note_anchor">[ 143 ]</span>The “ sunny seed ” in their hearts .<span type="note_anchor">[ 144 ]</span>From tine or tind , to set on fire . Hence tinder .<span type="note_anchor">[ 145 ]</span>The body of Jesus .<span type="note_anchor">[ 146 ]</span>Mark i . 35 ; Luke xxi . 37 . The word time must be associated both with progress and prayer — his walking-time and prayer-time .<span type="note_anchor">[ 147 ]</span>This is an allusion to the sphere-music : the great heavens is a clock whose hours are those when Jesus retires to his Father ; and to these hours the sphere-music gives the chime .<span type="note_anchor">[ 148 ]</span>He continues his poetic synonyms for the night .<span type="note_anchor">[ 149 ]</span>“ Behold I stand at the door and knock . ”<span type="note_anchor">[ 150 ]</span>A monosyllable .<span type="note_anchor">[ 151 ]</span>Often used for chambers .<span type="note_anchor">[ 152 ]</span>“ The creation looks for the light , thy shadow ? ” Or , “ The light looks for thy shadow , the sun ” ?<span type="note_anchor">[ 153 ]</span>Perforce : of necessity .<span type="note_anchor">[ 154 ]</span>He does not mean his fellows , but his bodily nature .<span type="note_anchor">[ 155 ]</span>Savourest ?<span type="note_anchor">[ 156 ]</span>The first I ever saw of its hymns was on a broad-sheet of Christmas Carols , with coloured pictures , printed in Seven Dials .<span type="note_anchor">[ 157 ]</span>They passed through twenty editions , not to mention one lately published ( by Daniel Sedgwick , of 81 , Sun-street , Bishopsgate , a man who , concerning hymns and their writers , knows more than any other man I have met ) , from which , carefully edited , I have gathered all my information , although I had known the book itself for many years .<span type="note_anchor">[ 158 ]</span>The animal spirits of the old physiologists .<span type="note_anchor">[ 159 ]</span>In the following five lines I have adopted the reading of the first edition , which , although a little florid , I prefer to the scanty two lines of the later .<span type="note_anchor">[ 160 ]</span>False in feeling , nor like God at all , although a ready pagan representation of him . There is much of the pagan left in many Christians — poets too .<span type="note_anchor">[ 161 ]</span>Insisting — persistent .<span type="note_anchor">[ 162 ]</span>Great cloudy ridges , one rising above the other , like a grand stair up to the heavens .
