     <l n="3">“ WHO gave this cup ? ” The secret thou wouldst steal</l>
     <l n="4">Its brimming flood forbids it to reveal :</l>
     <l n="5">No mortal 's eye shall read it till he first</l>
     <l n="6">Cool the red throat of thirst .</l>

     <l n="7">If on the golden floor one draught remain ,</l>

     <l n="11">Deeper than Truth lies buried in her well</l>

     <l n="14">Who the good angels be .</l>
    </lg>

     <l n="15">Whose bounty glistens in the beauteous gift</l>

     <l n="23">“ For whom this gift ? ” For one who all too long</l>
     <l n="24">Clings to his bough among the groves of song ;</l>

     <l n="4">While the eight per cent it gives</l>

     <l n="1">IF all the trees in all the woods were men ;</l>
     <l n="2">And each and every blade of grass a pen ;</l>
     <l n="3">If every leaf on every shrub and tree</l>
     <l n="4">Turned to a sheet of foolscap ; every sea</l>
     <l n="5">Were changed to ink , and all earth 's living tribes</l>
     <l n="6">Had nothing else to do but act as scribes ,</l>
     <l n="7">And for ten thousand ages , day and night ,</l>
     <l n="8">The human race should write , and write , and write ,</l>
     <l n="9">Till all the pens and paper were used up ,</l>
     <l n="10">And the huge inkstand was an empty cup ,</l>
     <l n="11">Still would the scribblers clustered round its brink</l>
     <l n="12">Call for more pens , more paper , and more ink .</l>

     <l n="1">LADY , life 's sweetest lesson wouldst thou learn ,</l>
     <l n="2">Come thou with me to Love 's enchanted bower</l>
     <l n="3">High overhead the trellised roses burn ;</l>
     <l n="4">Beneath thy feet behold the feathery fern ,—</l>
     <l n="5">A leaf without a flower .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="6">What though the rose leaves fall ? They still are sweet ,</l>
     <l n="7">And have been lovely in their beauteous prime ,</l>
     <l n="8">While the bare frond seems ever to repeat ,</l>
     <l n="9">“ For us no bud , no blossom , wakes to greet</l>
     <l n="10">The joyous flowering time ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="11">Heed thou the lesson . Life has leaves to tread</l>
     <l n="12">And flowers to cherish ; summer round thee glows ;</l>
     <l n="13">Wait not till autumn 's fading robes are shed ,</l>
     <l n="14">But while its petals still are burning red</l>
     <l n="15">Gather life 's full-blown rose !</l>

    <head>I LIKE YOU AND I LOVE YOU</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">I LIKE YOU Met I LOVE You , face to face ;</l>
     <l n="2">The path was narrow , and they could not pass .</l>
     <l n="3">I LIKE YOU smiled ; I LOVE YOU cried , Alas !</l>
     <l n="4">And so they halted for a little space .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">“ Turn thou and go before , ” I LOVE YOU said ,</l>
     <l n="6">“ Down the green pathway , bright with many a flower ;</l>
     <l n="7">Deep in the valley , lo ! my bridal bower</l>
     <l n="8">Awaits thee . ” But I LIKE YOU shook his head .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">Then while they lingered on the span-wide shelf</l>
     <l n="10">That shaped a pathway round the rocky ledge ,</l>
     <l n="11">I LIKE You bared his icy dagger 's edge ,</l>
     <l n="12">And first he slew I LOVE You ,— then himself .</l>

     <l n="1">FROM this fair home behold on either side</l>
     <l n="2">The restful mountains or the restless sea</l>
     <l n="3">So the warm sheltering walls of life divide</l>
     <l n="4">Time and its tides from still eternity .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">Look on the waves : their stormy voices teach</l>
     <l n="6">That not on earth may toil and struggle cease .</l>
     <l n="7">Look on the mountains : better far than speech</l>
     <l n="8">Their silent promise of eternal peace .</l>

     <l n="2">The witches are here ! They 've all come back !</l>
     <l n="3">They hanged them high ,— No use ! No use !</l>
     <l n="4">What cares a witch for a hangman 's noose ?</l>
     <l n="5">They buried them deep , but they would n't lie still ,</l>
     <l n="6">For cats and witches are hard to kill ;</l>

     <l n="8">Books said they did , but they lie ! they lie !</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">A couple of hundred years , or so ,</l>
     <l n="10">They had knocked about in the world below ,</l>
     <l n="11">When an Essex Deacon dropped in to call ,</l>
     <l n="12">And a homesick feeling seized them all ;</l>
     <l n="13">For he came from a place they knew full well ,</l>
     <l n="14">And many a tale he had to tell .</l>
     <l n="15">They longed to visit the haunts of men ,</l>
     <l n="16">To see the old dwellings they knew again ,</l>
     <l n="17">And ride on their broomsticks all around</l>
     <l n="18">Their wide domain of unhallowed ground .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="19">In Essex county there 's many a roof</l>
     <l n="20">Well known to him of the cloven hoof ;</l>
     <l n="21">The small square windows are full in view</l>
     <l n="22">Which the midnight hags went sailing through ,</l>
     <l n="23">On their well-trained broomsticks mounted high ,</l>
     <l n="24">Seen like shadows against the sky ;</l>
     <l n="25">Crossing the track of owls and bats ,</l>
     <l n="26">Hugging before them their coal-black cats .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="27">Well did they know , those gray old wives ,</l>
     <l n="28">The sights we see in our daily drives</l>
     <l n="29">Shimmer of lake and shine of sea ,</l>
     <l n="30">Browne 's bare hill with its lonely tree ,</l>
     <l n="31">( It was  n't then as we see it now ,</l>
     <l n="32">With one scant scalp-lock to shade its brow ;)</l>
     <l n="33">Dusky nooks in the Essex woods ,</l>
     <l n="34">Dark , dim , Dante-like solitudes ,</l>
     <l n="35">Where the tree-toad watches the sinuous snake</l>
     <l n="36">Glide through his forests of fern and brake ;</l>
     <l n="37">Ipswich River ; its old stone bridge ;</l>
     <l n="38">Far off Andover 's Indian Ridge ,</l>
     <l n="39">And many a scene where history tells</l>
     <l n="40">Some shadow of bygone terror dwells ,—</l>
     <l n="41">Of “ Norman 's Woe ” with its tale of dread ,</l>
     <l n="42">Of the Screeching Woman of Marblehead ,</l>
     <l n="43">( The fearful story that turns men pale</l>
     <l n="44">Do n't bid me tell it ,— my speech would fail . )</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="45">Who would not , will not , if he can ,</l>
     <l n="46">Bathe in the breezes of fair Cape Ann ,—</l>
     <l n="47">Rest in the bowers her bays enfold ,</l>
     <l n="48">Loved by the sachems and squaws of old ?</l>
     <l n="49">Home where the white magnolias bloom ,</l>
     <l n="50">Sweet with the bayberry 's chaste perfume ,</l>
     <l n="51">Hugged by the woods and kissed by the sea !</l>
     <l n="52">Where is the Eden like to thee ?</l>
     <l n="53">For that “ couple of hundred years , or so , ”</l>
     <l n="54">There had been no peace in the world below ;</l>
     <l n="55">The witches still grumbling , “ It is  n't fair ;</l>
     <l n="56">Come , give us a taste of the upper air !</l>
     <l n="57">We ‘ ve had enough of your sulphur springs ,</l>
     <l n="58">And the evil odor that round them clings ;</l>
     <l n="59">We long for a drink that is cool and nice ,—</l>
     <l n="60">Great buckets of water with Wenham ice ;</l>
     <l n="61">We 've served you well up-stairs , you know ;</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="63">I do n't feel sure of his being good ,</l>
     <l n="64">But he happened to be in a pleasant mood ,—</l>
     <l n="65">As fiends with their skins full sometimes are ,—</l>
     <l n="66">( He 'd been drinking with “ roughs ” at a Boston bar . )</l>
     <l n="67">So what does he do but up and shout</l>
     <l n="68">To a graybeard turnkey , “ Let ‘ em out ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="69">To mind his orders was all he knew ;</l>
     <l n="70">The gates swung open , and out they flew .</l>
     <l n="71">“ Where are our broomsticks ? ” the beldams cried .</l>
     <l n="72">“ Here are your broomsticks , ” an imp replied .</l>
     <l n="73">“ They ‘ ve been in — the place you know — so long</l>
     <l n="74">They smell of brimstone uncommon strong ;</l>
     <l n="75">But they 've gained by being left alone ,—</l>
     <l n="76">Just look , and you 'll see how tall they 've grown . ”</l>
     <l n="77">“ And where is my cat ? ” a vixen squalled .</l>
     <l n="78">“ Yes , where are our cats ? ” the witches bawled ,</l>
     <l n="79">And began to call them all by name</l>
     <l n="80">As fast as they called the cats , they came</l>
     <l n="81">There was bob-tailed Tommy and long-tailed Tim ,</l>
     <l n="82">And wall-eyed Jacky and green-eyed Jim ,</l>
     <l n="83">And splay-foot Benny and slim-legged Beau ,</l>
     <l n="84">And Skinny and Squally , and Jerry and Joe ,</l>
     <l n="85">And many another that came at call ,—</l>
     <l n="86">It would take too long to count them all .</l>
     <l n="87">All black ,— one could hardly tell which was which ,</l>
     <l n="88">But every cat knew his own old witch ;</l>
     <l n="89">And she knew hers as hers knew her ,—</l>
     <l n="90">Ah , did n't they curl their tails and purr !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="91">No sooner the withered hags were free</l>
     <l n="92">Than out they swarmed for a midnight spree ;</l>
     <l n="93">I could n't tell all they did in rhymes ,</l>
     <l n="94">But the Essex people had dreadful times .</l>
     <l n="95">The Swampscott fishermen still relate</l>
     <l n="96">How a strange sea-monster stole their bait ;</l>
     <l n="97">How their nets were tangled in loops and knots ,</l>
     <l n="98">And they found dead crabs in their lobster-pots .</l>
     <l n="99">Poor Danvers grieved for her blasted crops ,</l>
     <l n="100">And Wilmington mourned over mildewed hops .</l>
     <l n="101">A blight played havoc with Beverly beans ,—</l>
     <l n="102">It was all the work of those hateful queans !</l>
     <l n="103">A dreadful panic began at “ Pride 's , ”</l>
     <l n="104">Where the witches stopped in their midnight rides ,</l>
     <l n="105">And there rose strange rumors and vague alarms</l>
     <l n="106">‘ Mid the peaceful dwellers at Beverly Farms .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="107">Now when the Boss of the Beldams found</l>
     <l n="108">That without his leave they were ramping round ,</l>
     <l n="109">He called ,— they could hear him twenty miles ,</l>
     <l n="110">From Chelsea beach to the Misery Isles ;</l>
     <l n="111">The deafest old granny knew his tone</l>
     <l n="112">Without the trick of the telephone .</l>
     <l n="113">“ Come here , you witches ! Come here ! ” says he ,—</l>
     <l n="114">“ At your games of old , without asking me !</l>
     <l n="115">I 'll give you a little job to do</l>
     <l n="116">That will keep you stirring , you godless crew ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="117">They came , of course , at their master 's call ,</l>
     <l n="118">The witches , the broomsticks , the cats , and all ;</l>
     <l n="119">He led the hags to a railway train</l>

     <l n="5">Grayer he looks , less youthful , but the same</l>
     <l n="6">As when you called him by a different name .</l>
     <l n="7">Near him the MISTRESS , whose experienced skill</l>
     <l n="8">Has taught her duly every cup to fill ;</l>

     <l n="2">Of good St. Botolph 's island-studded bay ,</l>
     <l n="3">As from the gliding bark your eye has scanned</l>
     <l n="4">The beaconed rocks , the wave-girt hills of sand ,</l>
     <l n="5">Have ye not marked one elm-o'ershadowed isle ,</l>
     <l n="6">Round as the dimple chased in beauty 's smile ,—</l>
     <l n="7">A stain of verdure on an azure field ,</l>
     <l n="8">Set like a jewel in a battered shield ?</l>
     <l n="9">Fixed in the narrow gorge of Ocean 's path ,</l>
     <l n="10">Peaceful it meets him in his hour of wrath ;</l>
     <l n="11">When the mailed Titan , scourged by hissing gales ,</l>
     <l n="12">Writhes in his glistening coat of clashing scales ,</l>
     <l n="13">The storm-beat island spreads its tranquil green ,</l>
     <l n="14">Calm as an emerald on an angry queen .</l>
     <l n="15">So fair when distant should be fairer near ;</l>
     <l n="16">A boat shall waft us from the outstretched pier .</l>
     <l n="17">The breeze blows fresh ; we reach the island 's edge ,</l>
     <l n="18">Our shallop rustling through the yielding sedge .</l>
     <l n="19">No welcome greets us on the desert isle ;</l>
     <l n="20">Those elms , far-shadowing , hide no stately pile</l>
     <l n="21">Yet these green ridges mark an ancient road ;</l>

     <l n="23">The long gray line that marks a garden-wall ,</l>

     <l n="82">And thus , in varying phrase , the story ran .</l>
     <l n="83">His name had cost him little care to seek ,</l>
     <l n="84">Plain , honest , brief , a decent name to speak ,</l>
     <l n="85">Common , not vulgar , just the kind that slips</l>
     <l n="86">With least suggestion from a stranger 's lips .</l>
     <l n="87">His birthplace England , as his speech might show ,</l>
     <l n="88">Or his hale cheek , that wore the red-streak 's glow ;</l>
     <l n="89">His mouth sharp-moulded ; in its mirth or scorn</l>
     <l n="90">There came a flash as from the milky corn ,</l>
     <l n="91">When from the ear you rip the rustling sheath ,</l>
     <l n="92">And the white ridges show their even teeth .</l>
     <l n="93">His stature moderate , but his strength confessed ,</l>

     <l n="3">The Augur plied his legendary skill ;</l>
     <l n="4">Useless ; the fair young Roman languished still .</l>
     <l n="5">His chariot took him every cloudless day</l>
     <l n="6">Along the Pincian Hill or Appian Way ;</l>
     <l n="7">They rubbed his wasted limbs with sulphurous oil ,</l>

     <l n="12">They washed him , shivering , in her icy wave .</l>
     <l n="13">They sought all curious herbs and costly stones ,</l>
     <l n="14">They scraped the moss that grew on dead men 's bones ,</l>

     <l n="17">Traced the warm blood of Jesse 's royal son</l>
     <l n="18">To that fair alien , bravely wooed and won .</l>
     <l n="19">So fared they on to seek the promised sign ,</l>
     <l n="20">That marked the anointed heir of David 's line .</l>
     <l n="21">At last , by forms of earthly semblance led ,</l>

     <l n="23">No pomp was there , no glory shone around</l>
     <l n="24">On the coarse straw that strewed the reeking ground ;</l>
     <l n="25">One dim retreat a flickering torch betrayed ,—</l>
     <l n="26">In that poor cell the Lord of Life was laid</l>
     <l n="27">The wondering shepherds told their breathless tale</l>
     <l n="28">Of the bright choir that woke the sleeping vale ;</l>
     <l n="29">Told how the skies with sudden glory flamed ,</l>
     <l n="30">Told how the shining multitude proclaimed ,</l>

     <l n="32">In David 's city Christ the Lord is born !</l>
     <l n="33">‘ Glory to God ! ’ let angels shout on high ,</l>
     <l n="34">‘ Good-will to men ! ’ the listening earth reply ! ”</l>
     <l n="35">They spoke with hurried words and accents wild ;</l>
     <l n="36">Calm in his cradle slept the heavenly child .</l>
     <l n="37">No trembling word the mother 's joy revealed ,—</l>
     <l n="38">One sigh of rapture , and her lips were sealed ;</l>
     <l n="39">Unmoved she saw the rustic train depart ,</l>
     <l n="40">But kept their words to ponder in her heart .</l>

     <l n="41">Twelve years had passed ; the boy was fair and tall ,</l>
     <l n="42">Growing in wisdom , finding grace with all .</l>
     <l n="43">The maids of Nazareth , as they trooped to fill</l>
     <l n="44">Their balanced urns beside the mountain rill ,</l>
     <l n="45">The gathered matrons , as they sat and spun ,</l>
     <l n="46">Spoke in soft words of Joseph 's quiet son .</l>
     <l n="47">No voice had reached the Galilean vale</l>
     <l n="48">Of star-led kings , or awe-struck shepherd 's tale ;</l>
     <l n="49">In the meek , studious child they only saw</l>
     <l n="50">The future Rabbi , learned in Israel 's law .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="51">Beyond the hills that girt the village green ;</l>
     <l n="52">Save when at midnight , o'er the starlit sands ,</l>
     <l n="53">Snatched from the steel of Herod 's murdering bands ,</l>
     <l n="54">A babe , close folded to his mother 's breast ,</l>
     <l n="55">Through Edom 's wilds he sought the sheltering West .</l>
     <l n="56">Then Joseph spake : “ Thy boy hath largely grown ;</l>
     <l n="57">Weave him fine raiment , fitting to be shown ;</l>
     <l n="58">Fair robes beseem the pilgrim , as the priest ;</l>
     <l n="59">Goes he not with us to the holy feast ? ”</l>
     <l n="60">And Mary culled the flaxen fibres white ;</l>
     <l n="61">Till eve she spun ; she spun till morning light .</l>
     <l n="62">The thread was twined ; its parting meshes through</l>
     <l n="63">From hand to hand her restless shuttle flew ,</l>
     <l n="64">Till the full web was wound upon the beam ;</l>
     <l n="65">Love 's curious toil ,— a vest without a seam !</l>
     <l n="66">They reach the Holy Place , fulfil the days</l>
     <l n="67">To solemn feasting given , and grateful praise .</l>
     <l n="68">At last they turn , and far Moriah 's height</l>
     <l n="69">Melts in the southern sky and fades from sight .</l>
     <l n="70">All day the dusky caravan has flowed</l>
     <l n="71">In devious trails along the winding road ;</l>
     <l n="72">( For many a step their homeward path attends ,</l>
     <l n="73">And all the sons of Abraham are as friends . )</l>
     <l n="74">Evening has come ,— the hour of rest and joy ,—</l>
     <l n="75">Hush ! Hush ! That whisper ,— “ Where is Mary 's boy ? ”</l>
     <l n="76">Oh , weary hour ! Oh , aching days that passed</l>
     <l n="77">Filled with strange fears each wilder than the last ,—</l>
     <l n="78">The soldier 's lance , the fierce centurion 's sword ,</l>
     <l n="79">The crushing wheels that whirl some Roman lord ,</l>
     <l n="80">The midnight crypt that sucks the captive 's breath ,</l>
     <l n="81">The blistering sun on Hinnom 's vale of death !</l>
     <l n="82">Thrice on his cheek had rained the morning light ;</l>
     <l n="83">Thrice on his lips the mildewed kiss of night ,</l>
     <l n="84">Crouched by a sheltering column 's shining plinth ,</l>
     <l n="85">Or stretched beneath the odorous terebinth .</l>
     <l n="86">At last , in desperate mood , they sought once more</l>
     <l n="87">The Temple 's porches , searched in vain before ;</l>
     <l n="88">They found him seated with the ancient men ,—</l>
     <l n="89">The grim old rufflers of the tongue and pen ,—</l>
     <l n="90">Their bald heads glistening as they clustered near ,</l>
     <l n="91">Their gray beards slanting as they turned to hear ,</l>
     <l n="92">Lost in half-envious wonder and surprise</l>
     <l n="93">That lips so fresh should utter words so wise .</l>
     <l n="94">And Mary said ,— as one who , tried too long ,</l>
     <l n="95">Tells all her grief and half her sense of wrong ,—</l>
     <l n="96">What is this thoughtless thing which thou hast done ?</l>
     <l n="97">Lo , we have sought thee sorrowing , O my son !</l>
     <l n="98">Few words he spake , and scarce of filial tone ,</l>
     <l n="99">Strange words , their sense a mystery yet unknown ;</l>
     <l n="100">Then turned with them and left the holy hill ,</l>
     <l n="101">To all their mild commands obedient still .</l>
     <l n="102">The tale was told to Nazareth 's sober men ,</l>
     <l n="103">And Nazareth 's matrons told it oft again ;</l>

     <l n="105">The youthful shepherds doubted or denied ;</l>
     <l n="106">It passed around among the listening friends ,</l>
     <l n="107">With all that fancy adds and fiction lends ,</l>
     <l n="108">Till newer marvels dimmed the young renown</l>
