     <head>EARLIER POEMS</head>
     <head>1830-1836 OLD IRONSIDES</head>
     <p>This was the popular name by which the frigate Constitution was known . The poem was first printed in the Boston Daily Advertiser , at the time when it was proposed to break up the old ship as unfit for service . I subjoin the paragraph which led to the writing of the poem . It is from the Advertiser of Tuesday , September 14 , 1830 :—</p>
     <p>“ Old Ironsides .— It has been affirmed upon good authority that the Secretary of the Navy has recommended to the Board of Navy Commissioners to dispose of the frigate Constitution . Since it has been understood that such a step was in contemplation we have heard but one opinion expressed , and that in decided disapprobation of the measure . Such a national object of interest , so endeared to our national pride as Old Ironsides is , should never by any act of our government cease to belong to the Navy , so long as our country is to be found upon the map of nations . In England it was lately determined by the Admiralty to cut the Victory , a one-hundred gun ship ( which it will be recollected bore the flag of Lord Nelson at the battle of Trafalgar ,) down to a seventy-four , but so loud were the lamentations of the people upon the proposed measure that the intention was abandoned . We confidently anticipate that the Secretary of the Navy will in like manner consult the general wish in regard to the Constitution , and either let her remain in ordinary or rebuild her whenever the public service may require . ” — New York Journal of Commerce .</p>
     <p>The poem was an impromptu outburst of feeling and was published on the next day but one after reading the above paragraph .</p>

      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">AY , tear her tattered ensign down</l>
       <l n="2">Long has it waved on high ,</l>
       <l n="3">And many an eye has danced to see</l>
       <l n="4">That banner in the sky ;</l>
       <l n="5">Beneath it rung the battle shout ,</l>
       <l n="6">And burst the cannon 's roar ;—</l>
       <l n="7">The meteor of the ocean air</l>

       <l n="12">And waves were white below ,</l>
       <l n="13">No more shall feel the victor 's tread ,</l>

      <head>THE LAST LEAF</head>
      <head>This poem was suggested by the appearance in one of our streets of a venerable relic of the Revolution , said to be one of the party who threw the tea overboard in Boston Harbor . He was a fine monumental specimen in his cocked hat and knee breeches , with his buckled shoes and his sturdy cane . The smile with which I , as a young man , greeted him , meant no disrespect to an honored fellow-citizen whose costume was out of date , but whose patriotism never changed with years . I do not recall any earlier example of this form of verse , which was commended by the fastidious Edgar Allan Poe , who made a copy of the whole poem which I have in his own handwriting . Good Abraham Lincoln had a great liking for the poem , and repeated it from memory to Governor Andrew , as the governor himself told me .</head>

      <head>THE DORCHESTER GIANT</head>
      <head>The “ pudding-stone ” is a remarkable conglomerate found very abundantly in the towns mentioned , all of which are in the neighborhood of Boston . We used in those primitive days to ask friends to ride with us when we meant to take them to drive with us .</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">THERE was a giant in time of old ,</l>
       <l n="2">A mighty one was he ;</l>
       <l n="3">He had a wife , but she was a scold ,</l>
       <l n="4">So he kept her shut in his mammoth fold ;</l>
       <l n="5">And he had children three .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="6">It happened to be an election day ,</l>
       <l n="7">And the giants were choosing a king</l>
       <l n="8">The people were not democrats then ,</l>
       <l n="9">They did not talk of the rights of men ,</l>
       <l n="10">And all that sort of thing .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="11">Then the giant took his children three ,</l>
       <l n="12">And fastened them in the pen ;</l>
       <l n="13">The children roared ; quoth the giant , “ Be still ! ”</l>
       <l n="14">And Dorchester Heights and Milton Hill</l>
       <l n="15">Rolled back the sound again .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="16">Then he brought them a pudding stuffed with plums ,</l>
       <l n="17">As big as the State-House dome ;</l>
       <l n="18">Quoth he , “ There ‘ s something for you to eat ;</l>
       <l n="19">So stop your mouths with your ‘ lection treat ,</l>
       <l n="20">And wait till your dad comes home . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="21">So the giant pulled him a chestnut stout ,</l>
       <l n="22">And whittled the boughs away ;</l>
       <l n="23">The boys and their mother set up a shout ,</l>
       <l n="24">Said he , “ You ‘ re in , and you can n't get out ,</l>
       <l n="25">Bellow as loud as you may . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="26">Off he went , and he growled a tune</l>
       <l n="27">As he strode the fields along ;</l>
       <l n="28">‘ T is said a buffalo fainted away ,</l>
       <l n="29">And fell as cold as a lump of clay ,</l>
       <l n="30">When he heard the giant 's song .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="31">But whether the story ‘ s true or not ,</l>
       <l n="32">It is  n't for me to show ;</l>
       <l n="33">There ‘ s many a thing that ‘ s twice as queer</l>
       <l n="34">In somebody 's lectures that we hear ,</l>
       <l n="35">And those are true , you know .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="36">What are those lone ones doing now ,</l>
       <l n="37">The wife and the children sad ?</l>
       <l n="38">Oh , they are in a terrible rout ,</l>
       <l n="39">Screaming , and throwing their pudding about ,</l>
       <l n="40">Acting as they were mad .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="9">
       <l n="41">They flung it over to Roxbury hills ,</l>
       <l n="42">They flung it over the plain ,</l>
       <l n="43">And all over Milton and Dorchester too</l>
       <l n="44">Great lumps of pudding the giants threw ;</l>
       <l n="45">They tumbled as thick as rain .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="10">
       <l n="46">Giant and mammoth have passed away ,</l>
       <l n="47">For ages have floated by ;</l>
       <l n="48">The suet is hard as a marrow-bone ,</l>
       <l n="49">And every plum is turned to a stone ,</l>
       <l n="50">But there the puddings lie .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="11">
       <l n="51">And if , some pleasant afternoon ,</l>
       <l n="52">You ‘ ll ask me out to ride ,</l>
       <l n="53">The whole of the story I will tell ,</l>
       <l n="54">And you shall see where the puddings fell ,</l>
       <l n="55">And pay for the punch beside .</l>

      <head>THE SEPTEMBER GALE</head>
      <head>This tremendous hurricane occurred on the 23d of September , 1815 . I remember it well , being then seven years old . A full account of it was published , I think , in the records of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences . Some of my recollections are given in The Seasons , an article to be found in a book of mine entitled Pages from an Old Volume of Life .</head>

       <l n="1">I 'M not a chicken ; I have seen</l>
       <l n="2">Full many a chill September ,</l>
       <l n="3">And though I was a youngster then ,</l>
       <l n="4">That gale I well remember ;</l>
       <l n="5">The day before , my kite-string snapped ,</l>
       <l n="6">And I , my kite pursuing ,</l>
       <l n="7">The wind whisked off my palm-leaf hat ;</l>
       <l n="8">For me two storms were brewing !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="9">It came as quarrels sometimes do ,</l>
       <l n="10">When married folks get clashing ;</l>
       <l n="11">There was a heavy sigh or two ,</l>
       <l n="12">Before the fire was flashing ,—</l>
       <l n="13">A little stir among the clouds ,</l>
       <l n="14">Before they rent asunder ,—</l>
       <l n="15">A little rocking of the trees ,</l>

       <l n="30">Go riding off like witches ;</l>
       <l n="31">I lost , ah ! bitterly I wept ,—</l>

       <l n="44">The winds had whistled through them</l>
       <l n="45">I saw the wide and ghastly rents</l>
       <l n="46">Where demon claws had torn them ;</l>

       <l n="3">TO CHARLES WENTWORTH UPHAM , THE FOLLOWING METRICAL ESSAY IS</l>
       <l n="4">AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED .</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>This Academic Poem presents the simple and partial views of a young person trained after the schools of classical English verse as represented by Pope , Goldsmith , and Campbell , with whose lines his memory was early stocked . It will be observed that it deals chiefly with the constructive side of the poet 's function . That which makes him a poet is not the power of writing melodious rhymes , it is not the possession of ordinary human sensibilities nor even of both these qualities in connection with each other . I should rather say , if I were now called upon to define it , it is the power of transfiguring the experiences and shows of life into an aspect which comes from his imagination and kindles that of others . Emotion is its stimulus and language furnishes its expression ; but these are not all , as some might infer was the doctrine of the poem before the reader .</p>
     <p>A common mistake made by young persons who suppose themselves to have the poetical gift is that their own spiritual exaltation finds a true expression in the conventional phrases which are borrowed from the voices of the singers whose inspiration they think they share .</p>
     <p>Looking at this poem as an expression of some aspects of the ars poetica , with some passages which I can read even at this mature period of life without blushing for them , it may stand as the most serious representation of my early efforts . Intended as it was for public delivery , many of its paragraphs may betray the fact by their somewhat rhetorical and sonorous character .</p>

       <l n="36">Pure , pale in Virtue , as the star above ,</l>
       <l n="37">Or quivering roseate on the leaves of Love ;</l>
       <l n="38">Glaring like noontide , where it glows upon</l>
       <l n="39">Ambition 's sands ,— the desert in the sun ,—</l>
       <l n="40">Or soft suffusing o'er the varied scene</l>

      <head>ON LENDING A PUNCH-BOWL</head>
      <head>This “ punch-bowl ” was , according to old family tradition , a caudle-cup . It is a massive piece of silver , its cherubs and other ornaments of coarse repousse work , and has two handles like a loving-cup , by which it was held , or passed from guest to guest .</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">THIS ancient silver bowl of mine , it tells of good old times ,</l>
       <l n="2">Of joyous days and jolly nights , and merry Christmas times ;</l>
       <l n="3">They were a free and jovial race , but honest , brave , and true ,</l>
       <l n="4">Who dipped their ladle in the punch when this old bowl was new .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="5">A Spanish galleon brought the bar ,— so runs the ancient tale ;</l>
       <l n="6">‘ T was hammered by an Antwerp smith , whose arm was like a flail ;</l>
       <l n="7">And now and then between the strokes , for fear his strength should fail ,</l>
       <l n="8">He wiped his brow and quaffed a cup of good old Flemish ale .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="9">‘ T was purchased by an English squire to please his loving dame ,</l>
       <l n="10">Who saw the cherubs , and conceived a longing for the same ;</l>
       <l n="11">And oft as on the ancient stock another twig was found ,</l>
       <l n="12">‘ T was filled with candle spiced and hot , and handed smoking round .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="13">But , changing hands , it reached at length a Puritan divine ,</l>
       <l n="14">Who used to follow Timothy , and take a little wine ,</l>
       <l n="15">But hated punch and prelacy ; and so it was , perhaps ,</l>
       <l n="16">He went to Leyden , where he found conventicles and schnapps .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="17">And then , of course , you know what 's next : it left the Dutchman 's shore</l>
       <l n="18">With those that in the Mayflower came ,— a hundred souls and more ,—</l>
       <l n="19">Along with all the furniture , to fill their new abodes ,—</l>
       <l n="20">To judge by what is still on hand , at least a hundred loads .</l>

       <l n="22">When brave Miles Standish took the bowl , and filled it to the brim ;</l>
       <l n="23">The little Captain stood and stirred the posset with his sword ,</l>
       <l n="24">And all his sturdy men-at-arms were ranged about the board .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="25">He poured the fiery Hollands in ,— the man that never feared ,—</l>
       <l n="26">He took a long and solemn draught , and wiped his yellow beard ;</l>
       <l n="27">And one by one the musketeers — the men that fought and prayed —</l>
       <l n="28">All drank as ‘ t were their mother 's milk , and not a man afraid .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="29">That night , affrighted from his nest , the screaming eagle flew ,</l>
       <l n="30">He heard the Pequot 's ringing whoop , the soldier 's wild halloo ;</l>
       <l n="31">And there the sachem learned the rule he taught to kith and kin ,</l>
       <l n="32">Run from the white man when you find he smells of “ Hollands gin ! ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="9">
       <l n="33">A hundred years , and fifty more , had spread their leaves and snows ,</l>
       <l n="34">A thousand rubs had flattened down each little cherub 's nose ,</l>
       <l n="35">When once again the bowl was filled , but not in mirth or joy ,—</l>
       <l n="36">‘ T was mingled by a mother 's hand to cheer her parting boy .</l>

       <l n="44">‘ T is but the fool that loves excess ; hast thou a drunken soul ?</l>
       <l n="45">Thy bane is in thy shallow skull , not in my silver bowl !</l>

       <l n="48">Nay , this poor bauble it bequeathed ,— my eyes grow moist and dim ,</l>
       <l n="49">To think of all the vanished joys that danced around its brim .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="13">
       <l n="50">Then fill a fair and honest cup , and bear it straight to me ;</l>

      <head>A SONG</head>
      <head>FOR THE CENTENNIAL CELEBRATION OF HARVARD COLLEGE , 1836</head>
      <head>This song , which I had the temerity to sing myself ( felix auda-cia , Mr. Franklin Dexter had the goodness to call it ) , was sent in a little too late to be printed with the official account of the celebration . It was written at the suggestion of Dr. Jacob Bigelow , who thought the popular tune “ The Poacher 's Song ” would be a good model for a lively ballad or ditty . He himself wrote the admirable Latin song to be found in the record of the meeting .</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">WHEN the Puritans came over</l>
       <l n="2">Our hills and swamps to clear ,</l>
       <l n="3">The woods were full of catamounts ,</l>
       <l n="4">And Indians red as deer ,</l>
       <l n="5">With tomahawks and scalping-knives ,</l>
       <l n="6">That make folks ’ heads look queer ;</l>
       <l n="7">Oh the ship from England used to bring</l>
       <l n="8">A hundred wigs a year !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="9">The crows came cawing through the air</l>
       <l n="10">To pluck the Pilgrims ’ corn ,</l>
       <l n="11">The bears came snuffing round the door</l>
       <l n="12">Whene'er a babe was born ,</l>
       <l n="13">The rattlesnakes were bigger round</l>
       <l n="14">Than the but of the old rams horn</l>
       <l n="15">The deacon blew at meeting time</l>
       <l n="16">On every “ Sabbath ” morn .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="17">But soon they knocked the wigwams down ,</l>
       <l n="18">And pine-tree trunk and limb</l>
       <l n="19">Began to sprout among the leaves</l>
       <l n="20">In shape of steeples slim ;</l>
       <l n="21">And out the little wharves were stretched</l>
       <l n="22">Along the ocean 's rim ,</l>
       <l n="23">And up the little school-house shot</l>
       <l n="24">To keep the boys in trim .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="25">And when at length the College rose ,</l>
       <l n="26">The sachem cocked his eye</l>
       <l n="27">At every tutor 's meagre ribs</l>
       <l n="28">Whose coat-tails whistled by</l>
       <l n="29">But when the Greek and Hebrew words</l>
       <l n="30">Came tumbling from his jaws ,</l>
       <l n="31">The copper-colored children all</l>
       <l n="32">Ran screaming to the squaws .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="33">And who was on the Catalogue</l>
       <l n="34">When college was begun ?</l>
       <l n="35">Two nephews of the President ,</l>
       <l n="36">And the Professor 's son ;</l>
       <l n="37">( They turned a little Indian by ,</l>
       <l n="38">As brown as any bun ;)</l>
       <l n="39">Lord ! how the seniors knocked about</l>
       <l n="40">The freshman class of one !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="41">They had not then the dainty things</l>
       <l n="42">That commons now afford ,</l>
       <l n="43">But succotash and hominy</l>
       <l n="44">Were smoking on the board ;</l>
       <l n="45">They did not rattle round in gigs ,</l>
       <l n="46">Or dash in long-tailed blues ,</l>
       <l n="47">But always on Commencement days</l>
       <l n="48">The tutors blacked their shoes .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="49">God bless the ancient Puritans !</l>
       <l n="50">Their lot was hard enough ;</l>
       <l n="51">But honest hearts make iron arms ,</l>
       <l n="52">And tender maids are tough ;</l>
       <l n="53">So love and faith have formed and fed</l>
       <l n="54">Our true-born Yankee stuff ,</l>
       <l n="55">And keep the kernel in the shell</l>
       <l n="56">The British found so rough !</l>

      <head>THE ISLAND HUNTING-SONG</head>
      <head>The island referred to is a domain of princely proportions , which has long been the seat of a generous hospitality . Naushon is its old Indian name . William Swain , Esq ., commonly known as “ the Governor , ” was the proprietor of it at the time when this song was written . Mr. John M. Forbes is his worthy successor in territorial rights and as a hospitable entertainer . The Island Book has been the recipient of many poems from visitors and friends of the owners of the old mansion .</head>

       <l n="1">A HEALTH to dear woman ! She bids us untwine ,</l>
       <l n="2">From the cup it encircles , the fast-clinging vine ;</l>
       <l n="3">But her cheek in its crystal with pleasure will glow ,</l>
       <l n="4">And mirror its bloom in the bright wave below .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="5">A health to sweet woman ! The days are no more</l>
       <l n="6">When she watched for her lord till the revel was o'er ,</l>
       <l n="7">And smoothed the white pillow , and blushed when he came ,</l>
       <l n="8">As she pressed her cold lips on his forehead of flame .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="9">Alas for the loved one ! too spotless and fair</l>
       <l n="10">The joys of his banquet to chasten and share ;</l>
       <l n="11">Her eye lost its light that his goblet might shine ,</l>
       <l n="12">And the rose of her cheek was dissolved in his wine .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="13">Joy smiles in the fountain , health flows in the rills ,</l>
       <l n="14">As their ribbons of silver unwind from the hills ;</l>
       <l n="15">They breathe not the mist of the bacchanal 's dream ,</l>
       <l n="16">But the lilies of innocence float on their stream .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="17">Then a health and a welcome to woman once more !</l>
       <l n="18">She brings us a passport that laughs at our door ;</l>
       <l n="19">It is written on crimson ,— its letters are pearls ,—</l>
       <l n="20">It is countersigned Nature .— So , room for the Girls !</l>

      <head>A SENTIMENT</head>
       <l n="1">THE pledge of Friendship ! it is still divine ,</l>
       <l n="2">Though watery floods have quenched its burning wine ;</l>
       <l n="3">Whatever vase the sacred drops may hold ,</l>
       <l n="4">The gourd , the shell , the cup of beaten gold ,</l>
       <l n="5">Around its brim the hand of Nature throws</l>
       <l n="6">A garland sweeter than the banquet 's rose .</l>
       <l n="7">Bright are the blushes of the vine-wreathed bowl ,</l>
       <l n="8">Warm with the sunshine of Anacreon 's soul ,</l>
       <l n="9">But dearer memories gild the tasteless wave</l>
       <l n="10">That fainting Sidney perished as he gave .</l>
       <l n="11">‘ T is the heart 's current lends the cup its glow ,</l>
       <l n="12">Whate'er the fountain whence the draught may flow ,—</l>
       <l n="13">The diamond dew-drops sparkling through the sand ,</l>
       <l n="14">Scooped by the Arab in his sunburnt hand ,</l>
       <l n="15">Or the dark streamlet oozing from the snow ,</l>
       <l n="16">Where creep and crouch the shuddering Esquimaux ;</l>
       <l n="17">Ay , in the stream that , ere again we meet ,</l>
       <l n="18">Shall burst the pavement , glistening at our feet ,</l>
       <l n="19">And , stealing silent from its leafy hills ,</l>
       <l n="20">Thread all our alleys with its thousand rills ,—</l>
       <l n="21">In each pale draught if generous feeling blend ,</l>
       <l n="22">And o'er the goblet friend shall smile on friend ,</l>
       <l n="23">Even cold Cochituate every heart shall warm ,</l>
       <l n="24">And genial Nature still defy reform !</l>

       <l n="3">YES , dear Enchantress ,— wandering far and long ,</l>
       <l n="4">In realms unperfumed by the breath of song ,</l>
       <l n="5">Where flowers ill-flavored shed their sweets around ,</l>
       <l n="6">And bitterest roots invade the ungenial ground ,</l>
       <l n="7">Whose gems are crystals from the Epsom mine ,</l>

       <l n="9">Whose gates admit no mirthful feature in ,</l>
       <l n="10">Save one gaunt mocker , the Sardonic grin ,</l>
       <l n="11">Whose pangs are real , not the woes of rhyme</l>
       <l n="12">That blue-eyed misses warble out of time ;—</l>
       <l n="13">Truant , not recreant to thy sacred claim ,</l>
       <l n="14">Older by reckoning , but in heart the same ,</l>
       <l n="15">Freed for a moment from the chains of toil ,</l>
       <l n="16">I tread once more thy consecrated soil ;</l>
       <l n="17">Here at thy feet my old allegiance own ,</l>

       <l n="22">Love the light antics of a playful tongue ;</l>

       <l n="24">My lips let loose among the nuts and wine ,</l>
       <l n="25">Are all impatience till the opening pun</l>
       <l n="26">Proclaims the witty shamfight is begun .</l>
       <l n="27">Two fifths at least , if not the total half ,</l>

       <l n="32">Perform their laughter with superfluous noise ,</l>
       <l n="33">Beside her kerchief brought an extra one</l>
       <l n="34">To stop the explosions of her bursting son ;</l>

       <l n="36">Expects great doings in the button line ,—</l>
       <l n="37">For mirth 's concussions rip the outward case ,</l>
       <l n="38">And plant the stitches in a tenderer place .</l>
       <l n="39">I know my audience ,— these shall have their due ;</l>

       <l n="47">Her sweeter voice the Heavenly Maid imparts</l>

       <l n="51">For this , convulsed in thought 's maternal pains ,</l>
       <l n="52">She loads her arms with rhyme 's resounding chains ;</l>
       <l n="53">Faint though the music of her fetters be ,</l>

       <l n="69">No ! while I wander through the land of dreams ,</l>

       <l n="13">The native juice , the real honest squeeze ,— -</l>
       <l n="14">Strains that , diluted to the twentieth power ,</l>
       <l n="15">In yon grave temple might have filled an hour .</l>
       <l n="16">Small room for Fancy 's many-chorded lyre ,</l>
       <l n="17">For Wit 's bright rockets with their trains of fire ,</l>
       <l n="18">For Pathos , struggling vainly to surprise</l>
       <l n="19">The iron tutor 's tear-denying eyes ,</l>
       <l n="20">For Mirth , whose finger with delusive wile</l>

       <l n="24">The pun , the fun , the moral , and the joke ,</l>

       <l n="26">Small space for these , so pressed by niggard Time ,</l>

       <l n="34">But what a heap of motley trash appears</l>
       <l n="35">Crammed in the bundles of successive years !</l>
       <l n="36">As the lost rustic on some festal day</l>
       <l n="37">Stares through the concourse in its vast array ,—</l>
       <l n="38">Where in one cake a throng of faces runs ,</l>
       <l n="39">All stuck together like a sheet of buns ,—</l>
       <l n="40">And throws the bait of some unheeded name ,</l>
       <l n="41">Or shoots a wink with most uncertain aim ,</l>
       <l n="42">So roams my vision , wandering over all ,</l>
       <l n="43">And strives to choose , but knows not where to fall .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="44">Skins of flayed authors , husks of dead reviews ,</l>

       <l n="46">Scraps from cold feasts , where conversation runs</l>
       <l n="47">Through mouldy toasts to oxidated puns ,</l>
       <l n="48">And grating songs a listening crowd endures ,</l>
       <l n="49">Rasped from the throats of bellowing amateurs ;</l>
       <l n="50">Sermons , whose writers played such dangerous tricks</l>
       <l n="51">Their own heresiarchs called them heretics ,</l>
       <l n="52">( Strange that one term such distant poles should link ,</l>

       <l n="59">To guess what mummy of a thought was there ,</l>
       <l n="60">Where our poor English , striped with foreign phrase ,</l>
       <l n="61">Looks like a zebra in a parson 's chaise ;</l>
       <l n="62">Lectures that cut our dinners down to roots ,</l>
       <l n="63">Or prove ( by monkeys ) men should stick to fruits ,—</l>
       <l n="64">Delusive error , as at trifling charge</l>
       <l n="65">Professor Gripes will certify at large ;</l>
       <l n="66">Mesmeric pamphlets , which to facts appeal ,</l>
       <l n="67">Each fact as slippery as a fresh-caught eel ;</l>
       <l n="68">And figured heads , whose hieroglyphs invite</l>
       <l n="69">To wandering knaves that discount fools at sight :</l>
       <l n="70">Such things as these , with heaps of unpaid bills ,</l>
       <l n="71">And candy puffs and homoeopathic pills ,</l>
       <l n="72">And ancient bell-crowns with contracted rim ,</l>

       <l n="75">Their sequels tapering like a lizard 's tale ,—</l>
       <l n="76">How might we spread them to the smiling day ,</l>
       <l n="77">And toss them , fluttering like the new-mown hay ,</l>
       <l n="78">To laughter 's light or sorrow 's pitying shower ,</l>

       <l n="80">The narrow moments fit like Sunday shoes ,—</l>
       <l n="81">How vast the heap , how quickly must we choose !</l>
       <l n="82">A few small scraps from out his mountain mass</l>
       <l n="83">We snatch in haste , and let the vagrant pass .</l>
       <l n="84">This shrunken CRUST that Cerberus could not bite ,</l>
       <l n="85">Stamped ( in one corner ) “ Pickwick copyright , ”</l>
       <l n="86">Kneaded by youngsters , raised by flattery 's yeast ,</l>
       <l n="87">Was once a loaf , and helped to make a feast .</l>
       <l n="88">He for whose sake the glittering show appears</l>
       <l n="89">Has sown the world with laughter and with tears ,</l>
       <l n="90">And they whose welcome wets the bumper 's brim</l>
       <l n="91">Have wit and wisdom ,— for they all quote him .</l>
       <l n="92">So , many a tongue the evening hour prolongs</l>
       <l n="93">With spangled speeches ,— let alone the songs ;</l>
       <l n="94">Statesmen grow merry , lean attorneys laugh ,</l>
       <l n="95">And weak teetotals warm to half and half ,</l>
       <l n="96">And beardless Tullys , new to festive scenes ,</l>
       <l n="97">Cut their first crop of youth 's precocious greens ,</l>
       <l n="98">And wits stand ready for impromptu claps ,</l>
       <l n="99">With loaded barrels and percussion caps ,</l>
       <l n="100">And Pathos , cantering through the minor keys ,</l>
       <l n="101">Waves all her onions to the trembling breeze ;</l>
       <l n="102">While the great Feasted views with silent glee</l>
       <l n="103">His scattered limbs in Yankee fricassee .</l>

       <l n="107">Is ever pliant to the master 's art ;</l>

       <l n="109">And sheathes in velvet her obnoxious claws ,</l>
       <l n="110">And thrills the hand that smooths her glossy fur</l>

       <l n="120">And thou , Illustrious ! but too poorly paid</l>
       <l n="121">In toasts from Pickwick for thy great crusade ,</l>
       <l n="122">Though , while the echoes labored with thy name ,</l>

      <head>THE MORNING VISIT</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">A sick man 's chamber , though it often boast</l>
       <l n="2">The grateful presence of a literal toast ,</l>
       <l n="3">Can hardly claim , amidst its various wealth ,</l>
       <l n="4">The right unchallenged to propose a health ;</l>
       <l n="5">Yet though its tenant is denied the feast ,</l>
       <l n="6">Friendship must launch his sentiment at least ,</l>
       <l n="7">As prisoned damsels , locked from lovers ’ lips ,</l>
       <l n="8">Toss them a kiss from off their fingers ’ tips .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="9">The morning visit ,— not till sickness falls</l>
       <l n="10">In the charmed circles of your own safe walls ;</l>
       <l n="11">Till fever 's throb and pain 's relentless rack</l>
       <l n="12">Stretch you all helpless on your aching back ;</l>
       <l n="13">Not till you play the patient in your turn ,</l>
       <l n="14">The morning visit 's mystery shall you learn .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="15">‘ T is a small matter in your neighbor 's case ,</l>
       <l n="16">To charge your fee for showing him your face ;</l>
       <l n="17">You skip up-stairs , inquire , inspect , and touch ,</l>
       <l n="18">Prescribe , take leave , and off to twenty such .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="19">But when at length , by fate 's transferred decree ,</l>
       <l n="20">The visitor becomes the visitee ,</l>
       <l n="21">Oh , then , indeed , it pulls another string ;</l>
       <l n="22">Your ox is gored , and that 's a different thing !</l>
       <l n="23">Your friend is sick : phlegmatic as a Turk ,</l>
       <l n="24">You write your recipe and let it work ;</l>
       <l n="25">Not yours to stand the shiver and the frown ,</l>
       <l n="26">And sometimes worse , with which your draught goes down .</l>
       <l n="27">Calm as a clock your knowing hand directs ,</l>
       <l n="28">Rhei , jalapae ana grana sex ,</l>
       <l n="29">Or traces on some tender missive 's back ,</l>
       <l n="30">Scrupulos duos pulveris ipecac ;</l>
       <l n="31">And leaves your patient to his qualms and gripes ,</l>
       <l n="32">Cool as a sportsman banging at his snipes .</l>
       <l n="33">But change the time , the person , and the place ,</l>
       <l n="34">And be yourself “ the interesting case , ”</l>
       <l n="35">You 'll gain some knowledge which it 's well to learn ;</l>
       <l n="36">In future practice it may serve your turn .</l>
       <l n="37">Leeches , for instance ,— pleasing creatures quite ;</l>
       <l n="38">Try them ,— and bless you ,— do n't you find they bite ?</l>
       <l n="39">You raise a blister for the smallest cause ,</l>
       <l n="40">But be yourself the sitter whom it draws ,</l>
       <l n="41">And trust my statement , you will not deny</l>
       <l n="42">The worst of draughtsmen is your Spanish fly !</l>
       <l n="43">It 's mighty easy ordering when you please ,</l>
       <l n="44">Infusi sennae capiat uncias tres ;</l>
       <l n="45">It 's mighty different when you quackle down</l>
       <l n="46">Your own three ounces of the liquid brown .</l>
       <l n="47">Pilula , pulvis ,— pleasant words enough ,</l>
       <l n="48">When other throats receive the shocking stuff ;</l>
       <l n="49">But oh , what flattery can disguise the groan</l>
       <l n="50">That meets the gulp which sends it through your own !</l>
       <l n="51">Be gentle , then , though Art 's unsparing rules</l>
       <l n="52">Give you the handling of her sharpest tools ;</l>
       <l n="53">Use them not rashly ,— sickness is enough ;</l>
       <l n="54">Be always “ ready , ” but be never “ rough . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="55">Of all the ills that suffering man endures ,</l>
       <l n="56">The largest fraction liberal Nature cures ;</l>
       <l n="57">Of those remaining , ‘ t is the smallest part</l>
       <l n="58">Yields to the efforts of judicious Art ;</l>
       <l n="59">But simple Kindness , kneeling by the bed</l>
       <l n="60">To shift the pillow for the sick man 's head ,</l>
       <l n="61">Give the fresh draught to cool the lips that burn ,</l>
       <l n="62">Fan the hot brow , the weary frame to turn ,—</l>
       <l n="63">Kindness , untutored by our grave M. D .' s ,</l>
       <l n="64">But Nature 's graduate , when she schools to please ,</l>
       <l n="65">Wins back more sufferers with her voice and smile</l>
       <l n="66">Than all the trumpery in the druggist 's pile .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="67">Once more , be quiet : coming up the stair ,</l>
       <l n="68">Do n't be a plantigrade , a human bear ,</l>
       <l n="69">But , stealing softly on the silent toe ,</l>
       <l n="70">Reach the sick chamber ere you 're heard below .</l>
       <l n="71">Whatever changes there may greet your eyes ,</l>
       <l n="72">Let not your looks proclaim the least surprise ;</l>
       <l n="73">It 's not your business by your face to show</l>
       <l n="74">All that your patient does not want to know ;</l>
       <l n="75">Nay , use your optics with considerate care ,</l>
       <l n="76">And do n't abuse your privilege to stare .</l>
       <l n="77">But if your eyes may probe him overmuch ,</l>
       <l n="78">Beware still further how you rudely touch ;</l>
       <l n="79">Do n't clutch his carpus in your icy fist ,</l>
       <l n="80">But warm your fingers ere you take the wrist .</l>
       <l n="81">If the poor victim needs must be percussed ,</l>
       <l n="82">Do n't make an anvil of his aching bust ;</l>
       <l n="83">( Doctors exist within a hundred miles</l>
       <l n="84">Who thump a thorax as they 'd hammer piles ;)</l>
       <l n="85">If you must listen to his doubtful chest ,</l>
       <l n="86">Catch the essentials , and ignore the rest .</l>
       <l n="87">Spare him ; the sufferer wants of you and art</l>
       <l n="88">A track to steer by , not a finished chart .</l>
       <l n="89">So of your questions : do n't in mercy try</l>
       <l n="90">To pump your patient absolutely dry ;</l>
       <l n="91">He 's not a mollusk squirming in a dish ,</l>
       <l n="92">You 're not Agassiz ; and he 's not a fish .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="93">And last , not least , in each perplexing case ,</l>

       <l n="95">Not always smiling , but at least serene ,</l>
       <l n="96">When grief and anguish cloud the anxious scene .</l>
       <l n="97">Each look , each movement , every word and tone ,</l>
       <l n="98">Should tell your patient you are all his own ;</l>
       <l n="99">Not the mere artist , purchased to attend ,</l>
       <l n="100">But the warm , ready , self-forgetting friend ,</l>
       <l n="101">Whose genial visit in itself combines</l>

      <head>THE STETHOSCOPE SONG</head>
      <head>A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">THERE was a young man in Boston town ,</l>
       <l n="2">He bought him a stethoscope nice and new ,</l>
       <l n="3">All mounted and finished and polished down ,</l>
       <l n="4">With an ivory cap and a stopper too .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="5">It happened a spider within did crawl ,</l>
       <l n="6">And spun him a web of ample size ,</l>
       <l n="7">Wherein there chanced one day to fall</l>
       <l n="8">A couple of very imprudent flies .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="9">The first was a bottle-fly , big and blue ,</l>
       <l n="10">The second was smaller , and thin and long ;</l>
       <l n="11">So there was a concert between the two ,</l>
       <l n="12">Like an octave flute and a tavern gong .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="13">Now being from Paris but recently ,</l>
       <l n="14">This fine young man would show his skill ;</l>
       <l n="15">And so they gave him , his hand to try ,</l>
       <l n="16">A hospital patient extremely ill .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="17">Some said that his liver was short of bile ,</l>
       <l n="18">And some that his heart was over size ,</l>
       <l n="19">While some kept arguing , all the while ,</l>
       <l n="20">He was crammed with tubercles up to his eyes .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="21">This fine young man then up stepped he ,</l>
       <l n="22">And all the doctors made a pause ;</l>
       <l n="23">Said he , The man must die , you see ,</l>
       <l n="24">By the fifty-seventh of Louis 's laws .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="25">But since the case is a desperate one ,</l>
       <l n="26">To explore his chest it may be well ;</l>
       <l n="27">For if he should die and it were not done ,</l>
       <l n="28">You know the autopsy would not tell .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="29">Then out his stethoscope he took ,</l>
       <l n="30">And on it placed his curious ear ;</l>
       <l n="31">Mon Dieu ! said he , with a knowing look ,</l>
       <l n="32">Why , here is a sound that ‘ s mighty queer .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="9">
       <l n="33">The bourdonnement is very clear ,—</l>

       <l n="35">Five doctors took their turn to hear ;</l>
       <l n="36">Amphoric buzzing , said all the five .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="10">
       <l n="37">There 's empyema beyond a doubt ;</l>

       <l n="39">The diagnosis was made out ,—</l>
       <l n="40">They tapped the patient ; so he died .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="11">
       <l n="41">Now such as hate new-fashioned toys</l>
       <l n="42">Began to look extremely glum ;</l>

      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="12">
       <l n="45">There was an old lady had long been sick ,</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="13">
       <l n="49">So there the nice old lady sat ,</l>
       <l n="50">With phials and boxes all in a row ;</l>
       <l n="51">She asked the young doctor what he was at ,</l>
       <l n="52">To thump her and tumble her ruffles so .</l>
      </lg>

     <p>A SENTIMENT O Bios Bpaxus ,— life is but a song ; H rexvn uakpn ,— art is wondrous long ; Yet to the wise her paths are ever fair , And Patience smiles , though Genius may despair . Give us but knowledge , though by slow degrees , And blend our toil with moments bright as these ; Let Friendship 's accents cheer our doubtful way , And Love 's pure planet lend its guiding ray ,— Our tardy Art shall wear an angel 's wings , And life shall lengthen with the joy it brings !</p>

     <head>AGNES</head>
     <p>The story of Sir Harry Frankland and Agnes Surriage is told in the ballad with a very strict adhesion to the facts . These were obtained from information afforded me by the Rev . Mr. Webster , of Hopkinton , in company with whom I visited the Frankland Mansion in that town , then standing ; from a very interesting Memoir , by the Rev . Elias Nason , of Medford ; and from the manuscript diary of Sir Harry , or more properly Sir Charles Henry Frankland , now in the library of the Massachusetts Historical Society .</p>
     <p>At the time of the visit referred to , old Julia was living , and on our return we called at the house where she resided .— [ She was living June 10 , 1861 , when this ballad was published ] — Her account is little more than paraphrased in the poem . If the incidents are treated with a certain liberality at the close of the fifth part , the essential fact that Agnes rescued Sir Harry from the ruins after the earthquake , and their subsequent marriage as related , may be accepted as literal truth . So with regard to most of the trifling details which are given ; they are taken from the record . It is greatly to be regretted that the Frankland Mansion no longer exists . It was accidentally burned on the 23d of January , 1858 , a year or two after the first sketch of this ballad was written . A visit to it was like stepping out of the century into the years before the Revolution . A new house , similar in plan and arrangements to the old one , has been built upon its site , and the terraces , the clump of box , and the lilacs doubtless remain to bear witness to the truth of this story .</p>
     <p>The story , which I have told literally in rhyme , has been made the subject of a carefully studied and interesting romance by Mr. E. L. Bynner .</p>

       <l n="25">The bog 's green harper , thawing from his sleep ,</l>
       <l n="26">Twangs a hoarse note and tries a shortened leap ;</l>
       <l n="27">On floating rails that face the softening noons</l>
       <l n="28">The still shy turtles range their dark platoons ,</l>

       <l n="41">With yellower flames the lengthened sunshine glows ,</l>
       <l n="42">And love lays bare the passion-breathing rose ;</l>
       <l n="43">Queen of the lake , along its reedy verge</l>
       <l n="44">The rival lily hastens to emerge ,</l>
       <l n="45">Her snowy shoulders glistening as she strips ,</l>

       <l n="52">The fragrance borrowed where the myrtle blooms ;</l>

      <head>THE OLD PLAYER</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">THE curtain rose ; in thunders long and loud</l>
       <l n="2">The galleries rung ; the veteran actor bowed .</l>
       <l n="3">In flaming line the telltales of the stage</l>
       <l n="4">Showed on his brow the autograph of age ;</l>
       <l n="5">Pale , hueless waves amid his clustered hair ,</l>
       <l n="6">And umbered shadows , prints of toil and care ;</l>
       <l n="7">Round the wide circle glanced his vacant eye ,—</l>
       <l n="8">He strove to speak ,— his voice was but a sigh .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="9">Year after year had seen its short-lived race</l>
       <l n="10">Flit past the scenes and others take their place ;</l>
       <l n="11">Yet the old prompter watched his accents still ,</l>
       <l n="12">His name still flaunted on the evening 's bill .</l>
       <l n="13">Heroes , the monarchs of the scenic floor ,</l>
       <l n="14">Had died in earnest and were heard no more ;</l>
       <l n="15">Beauties , whose cheeks such roseate bloom o'er-spread</l>
       <l n="16">They faced the footlights in unborrowed red ,</l>
       <l n="17">Had faded slowly through successive shades</l>
       <l n="18">To gray duennas , foils of younger maids ;</l>
       <l n="19">Sweet voices lost the melting tones that start</l>
       <l n="20">With Southern throbs the sturdy Saxon heart ,</l>
       <l n="21">While fresh sopranos shook the painted sky</l>
       <l n="22">With their long , breathless , quivering locust-cry .</l>
       <l n="23">Yet there he stood ,— the man of other days ,</l>
       <l n="24">In the clear present 's full , unsparing blaze ,</l>
       <l n="25">As on the oak a faded leaf that clings</l>
       <l n="26">While a new April spreads its burnished wings .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="27">How bright yon rows that soared in triple tier ,</l>
       <l n="28">Their central sun the flashing chandelier !</l>
       <l n="29">How dim the eye that sought with doubtful aim</l>
       <l n="30">Some friendly smile it still might dare to claim</l>
       <l n="31">How fresh these hearts ! his own how worn and cold !</l>
       <l n="32">Such the sad thoughts that long-drawn sigh had told .</l>
       <l n="33">No word yet faltered on his trembling tongue ;</l>
       <l n="34">Again , again , the crashing galleries rung .</l>
       <l n="35">As the old guardsman at the bugle 's blast</l>
       <l n="36">Hears in its strain the echoes of the past ,</l>
       <l n="37">So , as the plaudits rolled and thundered round ,</l>
       <l n="38">A life of memories startled at the sound .</l>
       <l n="39">He lived again ,— the page of earliest days ,—</l>
       <l n="40">Days of small fee and parsimonious praise ;</l>
       <l n="41">Then lithe young Romeo — hark that silvered tone ,</l>
       <l n="42">From those smooth lips — alas ! they were his own .</l>
       <l n="43">Then the bronzed Moor , with all his love and woe ,</l>
       <l n="44">Told his strange tale of midnight melting snow ;</l>
       <l n="45">And dark — plumed Hamlet , with his cloak and blade ,</l>
       <l n="46">Looked on the royal ghost , himself a shade .</l>
       <l n="47">All in one flash , his youthful memories came ,</l>
       <l n="48">Traced in bright hues of evanescent flame ,</l>
       <l n="49">As the spent swimmer 's in the lifelong dream ,</l>
       <l n="50">While the last bubble rises through the stream .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="51">Call him not old , whose visionary brain</l>
       <l n="52">Holds o'er the past its undivided reign .</l>
       <l n="53">For him in vain the envious seasons roll</l>
       <l n="54">Who bears eternal summer in his soul .</l>
       <l n="55">If yet the minstrel 's song , the poet 's lay ,</l>
       <l n="56">Spring with her birds , or children at their play ,</l>
       <l n="57">Or maiden 's smile , or heavenly dream of art ,</l>
       <l n="58">Stir the few life-drops creeping round his heart ,</l>
       <l n="59">Turn to the record where his years are told ,—</l>
       <l n="60">Count his gray hairs ,— they cannot make him old !</l>
       <l n="61">What magic power has changed the faded mime ?</l>
       <l n="62">One breath of memory on the dust of time .</l>
       <l n="63">As the last window in the buttressed wall</l>
       <l n="64">Of some gray minster tottering to its fall ,</l>
       <l n="65">Though to the passing crowd its hues are spread ,</l>
       <l n="66">A dull mosaic , yellow , green , and red ,</l>
       <l n="67">Viewed from within , a radiant glory shows</l>
       <l n="68">When through its pictured screen the sunlight flows ,</l>
       <l n="69">And kneeling pilgrims on its storied pane</l>
       <l n="70">See angels glow in every shapeless stain ;</l>
       <l n="71">So streamed the vision through his sunken eye ,</l>
       <l n="72">Clad in the splendors of his morning sky .</l>
       <l n="73">All the wild hopes his eager boyhood knew ,</l>
       <l n="74">All the young fancies riper years proved true ,</l>
       <l n="75">The sweet , low-whispered words , the winning glance</l>
       <l n="76">From queens of song , from Houris of the dance ,</l>
       <l n="77">Wealth 's lavish gift , and Flattery 's soothing phrase ,</l>
       <l n="78">And Beauty 's silence when her blush was praise ,</l>
       <l n="79">And melting Pride , her lashes wet with tears ,</l>
       <l n="80">Triumphs and banquets , wreaths and crowns and cheers ,</l>
       <l n="81">Pangs of wild joy that perish on the tongue ,</l>
       <l n="82">And all that poets dream , but leave unsung !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="83">In every heart some viewless founts are fed</l>
       <l n="84">From far-off hillsides where the dews were shed ;</l>
       <l n="85">On the worn features of the weariest face</l>
       <l n="86">Some youthful memory leaves its hidden trace ,</l>
       <l n="87">As in old gardens left by exiled kings</l>
       <l n="88">The marble basins tell of hidden springs ,</l>
       <l n="89">But , gray with dust , and overgrown with weeds ,</l>
       <l n="90">Their choking jets the passer little heeds ,</l>
       <l n="91">Till time 's revenges break their seals away ,</l>
       <l n="92">And , clad in rainbow light , the waters play .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="93">Good night , fond dreamer ! let the curtain fall</l>
       <l n="94">The world 's a stage , and we are players all .</l>
       <l n="95">A strange rehearsal ! Kings without their crowns ,</l>
       <l n="96">And threadbare lords , and jewel-wearing clowns ,</l>
       <l n="97">Speak the vain words that mock their throbbing hearts ,</l>
       <l n="98">As Want , stern prompter ! spells them out their parts .</l>
       <l n="99">The tinselled hero whom we praise and pay</l>
       <l n="100">Is twice an actor in a twofold play .</l>
       <l n="101">We smile at children when a painted screen</l>
       <l n="102">Seems to their simple eyes a real scene ;</l>
       <l n="103">Ask the poor hireling , who has left his throne</l>
       <l n="104">To seek the cheerless home he calls his own ,</l>
       <l n="105">Which of his double lives most real seems ,</l>
       <l n="106">The world of solid fact or scenic dreams ?</l>
       <l n="107">Canvas , or clouds ,— the footlights , or the spheres ,—</l>
       <l n="108">The play of two short hours , or seventy years ?</l>
       <l n="109">Dream on ! Though Heaven may woo our open eyes ,</l>
       <l n="110">Through their closed lids we look on fairer skies ;</l>
       <l n="111">Truth is for other worlds , and hope for this ;</l>
       <l n="112">The cheating future lends the present 's bliss ;</l>
       <l n="113">Life is a running shade , with fettered hands ,</l>
       <l n="114">That chases phantoms over shifting sands ;</l>
       <l n="115">Death a still spectre on a marble seat ,</l>
       <l n="116">With ever clutching palms and shackled feet ;</l>
       <l n="117">The airy shapes that mock life 's slender chain ,</l>
       <l n="118">The flying joys he strives to clasp in vain ,</l>
       <l n="119">Death only grasps ; to live is to pursue ,—</l>
       <l n="120">Dream on ! there ‘ s nothing but illusion true !</l>

       <l n="1">DEDICATION OF THE PITTSFIELD CEMETERY ,</l>
       <l n="2">SEPTEMBER 9 , 1850</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="3">ANGEL of Death ! extend thy silent reign !</l>
       <l n="4">Stretch thy dark sceptre o'er this new domain</l>
       <l n="5">No sable car along the winding road</l>
       <l n="6">Has borne to earth its unresisting load ;</l>
       <l n="7">No sudden mound has risen yet to show</l>
       <l n="8">Where the pale slumberer folds his arms below ;</l>
       <l n="9">No marble gleams to bid his memory live</l>
       <l n="10">In the brief lines that hurrying Time can give ;</l>
       <l n="11">Yet , O Destroyer ! from thy shrouded throne</l>
       <l n="12">Look on our gift ; this realm is all thine own !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="13">Fair is the scene ; its sweetness oft beguiled</l>
       <l n="14">From their dim paths the children of the wild ;</l>
       <l n="15">The dark-haired maiden loved its grassy dells ,</l>
       <l n="16">The feathered warrior claimed its wooded swells ,</l>
       <l n="17">Still on its slopes the ploughman 's ridges show</l>
       <l n="18">The pointed flints that left his fatal bow ,</l>
       <l n="19">Chipped with rough art and slow barbarian toil ,—</l>
       <l n="20">Last of his wrecks that strews the alien soil !</l>
       <l n="21">Here spread the fields that heaped their ripened store</l>
       <l n="22">Till the brown arms of Labor held no more ;</l>
       <l n="23">The scythe 's broad meadow with its dusky blush ;</l>
       <l n="24">The sickle 's harvest with its velvet flush ;</l>
       <l n="25">The green-haired maize , her silken tresses laid ,</l>
       <l n="26">In soft luxuriance , on her harsh brocade ;</l>
       <l n="27">The gourd that swells beneath her tossing plume ;</l>
       <l n="28">The coarser wheat that rolls in lakes of bloom ,—</l>
       <l n="29">Its coral stems and milk-white flowers alive</l>
       <l n="30">With the wide murmurs of the scattered hive ;</l>
       <l n="31">Here glowed the apple with the pencilled streak</l>
       <l n="32">Of morning painted on its southern cheek ;</l>
       <l n="33">The pear 's long necklace strung with golden drops ,</l>
       <l n="34">Arched , like the banian , o'er its pillared props ;</l>
       <l n="35">Here crept the growths that paid the laborer 's care</l>
       <l n="36">With the cheap luxuries wealth consents to spare ;</l>
       <l n="37">Here sprang the healing herbs which could not save</l>
       <l n="38">The hand that reared them from the neighboring grave .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="39">Yet all its varied charms , forever free</l>
       <l n="40">From task and tribute , Labor yields to thee</l>
       <l n="41">No more , when April sheds her fitful rain ,</l>
       <l n="42">The sower 's hand shall cast its flying grain ;</l>
       <l n="43">No more , when Autumn strews the flaming leaves ,</l>
       <l n="44">The reaper 's band shall gird its yellow sheaves ;</l>
       <l n="45">For thee alike the circling seasons flow</l>
       <l n="46">Till the first blossoms heave the latest snow .</l>
       <l n="47">In the stiff clod below the whirling drifts ,</l>
       <l n="48">In the loose soil the springing herbage lifts ,</l>
       <l n="49">In the hot dust beneath the parching weeds ,</l>
       <l n="50">Life 's withering flower shall drop its shrivelled seeds ;</l>
       <l n="51">Its germ entranced in thy unbreathing sleep</l>
       <l n="52">Till what thou sowest mightier angels reap !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="53">Spirit of Beauty ! let thy graces blend</l>
       <l n="54">With loveliest Nature all that Art can lend .</l>
       <l n="55">Come from the bowers where Summer 's life-blood flows</l>
       <l n="56">Through the red lips of June 's half-open rose ,</l>
       <l n="57">Dressed in bright hues , the loving sunshine 's dower ;</l>
       <l n="58">For tranquil Nature owns no mourning flower .</l>
       <l n="59">Come from the forest where the beech 's screen</l>
       <l n="60">Bars the fierce moonbeam with its flakes of green ;</l>
       <l n="61">Stay the rude axe that bares the shadowy plains ,</l>
       <l n="62">Stanch the deep wound That dries the maple 's veins .</l>
       <l n="63">Come with the stream whose silver-braided rills</l>
       <l n="64">Fling their unclasping bracelets from the hills ,</l>
       <l n="65">Till in one gleam , beneath the forest 's wings ,</l>
       <l n="66">Melts the white glitter of a hundred springs .</l>
       <l n="67">Come from the steeps where look majestic forth</l>
       <l n="68">From their twin thrones the Giants of the North</l>
       <l n="69">On the huge shapes , that , crouching at their knees ,</l>
       <l n="70">Stretch their broad shoulders , rough with shaggy trees .</l>
       <l n="71">Through the wide waste of ether , not in vain ,</l>
       <l n="72">Their softened gaze shall reach our distant plain ;</l>
       <l n="73">There , while the mourner turns his aching eyes</l>
       <l n="74">On the blue mounds that print the bluer skies ,</l>
       <l n="75">Nature shall whisper that the fading view</l>
       <l n="76">Of mightiest grief may wear a heavenly hue .</l>
       <l n="77">Cherub of Wisdom ! let thy marble page</l>
       <l n="78">Leave its sad lesson , new to every age ;</l>
       <l n="79">Teach us to live , not grudging every breath</l>
       <l n="80">To the chill winds that waft us on to death ,</l>
       <l n="81">But ruling calmly every pulse it warms ,</l>
       <l n="82">And tempering gently every word it forms .</l>
       <l n="83">Seraph of Love ! in heaven 's adoring zone ,</l>
       <l n="84">Nearest of all around the central throne ,</l>
       <l n="85">While with soft hands the pillowed turf we spread</l>
       <l n="86">That soon shall hold us in its dreamless bed ,</l>
       <l n="87">With the low whisper ,— Who shall first be laid</l>
       <l n="88">In the dark chamber 's yet unbroken shade ?—</l>
       <l n="89">Let thy sweet radiance shine rekindled here ,</l>
       <l n="90">And all we cherish grow more truly dear .</l>
       <l n="91">Here in the gates of Death 's o'erhanging vault ,</l>
       <l n="92">Oh , teach us kindness for our brother 's fault</l>
       <l n="93">Lay all our wrongs beneath this peaceful sod ,</l>
       <l n="94">And lead our hearts to Mercy and its God .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="95">FATHER of all ! in Death 's relentless claim</l>

       <l n="97">In the bright flower that decks the solemn bier ,</l>
       <l n="98">We see thy glory in its narrowed sphere ;</l>
       <l n="99">In the deep lessons that affliction draws ,</l>
       <l n="100">We trace the curves of thy encircling laws ;</l>

       <l n="115">Age in its weakness , bowed by toil and care ,</l>

      <head>TO GOVERNOR SWAIN</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">DEAR GOVERNOR , if my skiff might brave</l>
       <l n="2">The winds that lift the ocean wave ,</l>
       <l n="3">The mountain stream that loops and swerves</l>
       <l n="4">Through my broad meadow 's channelled curves</l>
       <l n="5">Should waft me on from bound to bound</l>
       <l n="6">To where the River weds the Sound ,</l>
       <l n="7">The Sound should give me to the Sea ,</l>
       <l n="8">That to the Bay , the Bay to thee .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="9">It may not be ; too long the track</l>
       <l n="10">To follow down or struggle back .</l>
       <l n="11">The sun has set on fair Naushon</l>
       <l n="12">Long ere my western blaze is gone ;</l>
       <l n="13">The ocean disk is rolling dark</l>
       <l n="14">In shadows round your swinging bark ,</l>

       <l n="18">Long ere my barnyard chanticleer ;</l>
       <l n="19">Your mists are soaring in the blue</l>

       <l n="24">What goodly feats of peaceful strife ,—</l>
       <l n="25">Such jests , that , drained of every joke ,</l>
       <l n="26">The very bank of language broke ,—</l>
       <l n="27">Such deeds , that Laughter nearly died</l>
       <l n="28">With stitches in his belted side ;</l>
       <l n="29">While Time , caught fast in pleasure 's chain ,</l>
       <l n="30">His double goblet snapped in twain ,</l>
       <l n="31">And stood with half in either hand ,—</l>
       <l n="32">Both brimming full ,— but not of sand !</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>It may not be ; I strive in vain To break my slender household chain ,— Three pairs of little clasping hands , One voice , that whispers , not commands . Even while my spirit flies away , My gentle jailers murmur nay ; All shapes of elemental wrath They raise along my threatened path ; The storm grows black , the waters rise , The mountains mingle with the skies , The mad tornado scoops the ground , The midnight robber prowls around ,— Thus , kissing every limb they tie , They draw a knot and heave a sigh , Till , fairly netted in the toil , My feet are rooted to the soil . Only the soaring wish is free !— And that , dear Governor , flies to thee ! PITTSFIELD , 1851 .</p>

       <l n="8">We come again , like half-grown boys , and gather at her beck</l>

      <head>AT A MEETING OF FRIENDS</head>
      <head>AUGUST 29 , 1859</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">I REMEMBER — why , yes ! God bless me ! and was it so long ago ?</l>
       <l n="2">I fear I 'm growing forgetful , as old folks do , you know ;</l>
       <l n="3">It must have been in ‘ forty — I would say ‘ thirty-nine —</l>
       <l n="4">We talked this matter over , I and a friend of mine .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="5">He said , “ Well now , old fellow , I 'm thinking that you and I ,</l>
       <l n="6">If we act like other people , shall be older by and by ;</l>
       <l n="7">What though the bright blue ocean is smooth as a pond can be ,</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="9">“ We 're taking it mighty easy , but that is nothing strange ,</l>
       <l n="10">For up to the age of thirty we spend our years like Change ;</l>
       <l n="11">But creeping up towards the forties , as fast as the old years fill ,</l>
       <l n="12">And Time steps in for payment , we seem to change a bill . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="13">“ I know it , ” I said , “ old fellow ; you speak the solemn truth ;</l>
       <l n="14">A man can n't live to a hundred and likewise keep his youth ;</l>
       <l n="15">But what if the ten years coming shall silver-streak my hair ,</l>
       <l n="16">You know I shall then be forty ; of course I shall not care .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="17">“ At forty a man grows heavy and tired of fun and noise ;</l>
       <l n="18">Leaves dress to the five-and-twenties and love to the silly boys ;</l>
       <l n="19">No foppish tricks at forty , no pinching of waists and toes ,</l>
       <l n="20">But high-low shoes and flannels and good thick worsted hose . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="21">But one fine August morning I found myself awake</l>
       <l n="22">My birthday :— By Jove , I 'm forty ! Yes , forty , and no mistake !</l>
       <l n="23">Why , this is the very milestone , I think I used to hold ,</l>

       <l n="27">A man 's in his prime at forty ,— I see that plain enough ;</l>
       <l n="28">At fifty a man is wrinkled , and may be bald or gray ;</l>
       <l n="29">I call men old at fifty , in spite of all they say .</l>

       <l n="30">At last comes another August with mist and rain and shine ;</l>

       <l n="32">And when on the western summits the fading light appears ,</l>
       <l n="33">It touches with rosy fingers the last of my fifty years .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="9">
       <l n="34">There have been both men and women whose hearts were firm and bold ,</l>

       <l n="42">No ! say that his hearing fails him ; say that his sight grows dim ;</l>
       <l n="43">Say that he 's getting wrinkled and weak in back and limb ,</l>
       <l n="44">Losing his wits and temper , but pleading , to make amends ,</l>

      <docTitle><titlePart>BROTHER JONATHAN 'S LAMENT FOR SISTER CAROLINE SHE has gone ,— she has left us in passion and pride ,— Our stormy-browed sister , so long at our side ! She has torn her own star from our firmament 's glow , And turned on her brother the face of a foe ! Oh , Caroline , Caroline , child of the sun , We can never forget that our hearts have been one ,— Our foreheads both sprinkled in Liberty 's name , From the fountain of blood with the finger of flame ! You were always too ready to fire at a touch ; But we said , “ She is hasty ,— she does not mean much . ” We have scowled , when you uttered some turbulent threat ; But Friendship still whispered , “ Forgive and forget ! ” Has our love all died out ? Have its altars grown cold ? Has the curse come at last which the fathers foretold ? Then Nature must teach us the strength of the chain That her petulant children would sever in vain . They may fight till the buzzards are gorged with their spoil , Till the harvest grows black as it rots in the soil , Till the wolves and the catamounts troop from their eaves , And the shark tracks the pirate , the lord of the waves : In vain is the strife ! When its fury is past , Their fortunes must flow in one channel at last , As the torrents that rush from the mountains of snow Roll mingled in peace through the valleys below . Our Union is river , lake , ocean , and sky Man breaks not the medal , when God cuts the die ! Though darkened with sulphur , though cloven with steel , The blue arch will brighten , the waters will heal ! Oh , Caroline , Caroline , child of the sun , There are battles with Fate that can never be won ! The star-flowering banner must never be furled , For its blossoms of light are the hope of the world ! Go , then , our rash sister ! afar and aloof , Run wild in the sunshine away from our roof ; But when your heart aches and your feet have grown sore , Remember the pathway that leads to our door !</titlePart></docTitle>

NOTES : ( For original print volume one ) [ There stand the Goblet and the Sun . ] The Goblet and the Sun ( Vas-Sol ) , sculptured on a free-stone slab supported by five pillars , are the only designation of the family tomb of the Vassalls . [ Thus mocked the spoilers with his school-boy scorn . ] See “ Old Ironsides , ” of this volume . [ On other shores , above their mouldering towns . ] Daniel Webster quoted several of the verses which follow , in his address at the laying of the corner-stone of the addition to the Capitol at Washington , July 4 ,<date>1851</date>.

The completion of this edifice , the design of which included a spire , was prevented by the troubles of the Revolution , and its plain , square tower presented nothing more attractive than a massive simplicity . In the front of this tower , till the church was demolished in<date>1872</date>, there was to be seen , half imbedded in the brick-work , a cannon-ball , which was thrown from the American fortifications at<settlement>Cambridge</settlement>, during the bombard-ment of the city , then occupied by the British troops . 3 .

       <l n="2">IT is a pity and a shame — alas ! alas ! I know it is ,</l>
       <l n="3">To tread the trodden grapes again , but so it has been ,</l>
       <l n="4">so it is ;</l>
       <l n="5">The purple vintage long is past , with ripened</l>
       <l n="6">clusters bursting so</l>

     <p>Too well our faithful memory tells what might be rhymed or sung about , For all have sighed and some have wept since last year 's snows were flung about ; The beacon flame that fired the sky , the modest ray that gladdened us , A little breath has quenched their light , and deepening shades have saddened us .</p>
     <p>No more our brother 's life is ours for cheering or for grieving us , One only sadness they bequeathed , the sorrow of their leaving us ; Farewell ! Farewell !— I turn the leaf I read my chiming measure in ; Who knows but something still is there a friend may find a pleasure in ? For who can tell by what he likes what other people 's fancies are ? How all men think the best of wives their own particular Nancies are ? If what I sing you brings a smile , you will not stop to catechise , Nor read Bceotia 's lumbering line with nicely scanning Attic eyes .</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">Perhaps the alabaster box that Mary broke so</l>
       <l n="2">lovingly ,</l>
       <l n="3">While Judas looked so sternly on , the Master so</l>
       <l n="4">approvingly ,</l>
       <l n="5">Was not so fairly wrought as those that Pilate 's</l>
       <l n="6">wife and daughters had ,</l>
       <l n="7">Or many a dame of Judah 's line that drank of</l>
       <l n="8">Jordan 's waters had .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>Perhaps the balm that cost so dear , as some remarked officiously , The precious nard that filled the room with fragrance so deliciously , So oft recalled in storied page and sung in verse melodious , The dancing girl had thought too cheap ,— that daughter of Herodias .</p>
     <p>Where now are all the mighty deeds that Herod boasted loudest of ? Where now the flashing jewelry the tetrarch 's wife was proudest of ? Yet still to hear how Mary loved , all tribes of men are listening , And still the sinful woman 's tears like stars heaven are glistening .</p>
     <p>‘ T is not the gift our hands have brought , the love it is we bring with it ,— The minstrel 's lips may shape the song , his heart in tune must sing with it ; And so we love the simple lays , and wish we might have more of them , Our poet brothers sing for us ,— there must be half a score of them .</p>
     <p>It may be that of fame and name our voices once were emulous ,— With deeper thoughts , with tenderer throbs their softening tones are tremulous ; The dead seem listening as of old , ere friendship was bereft of them ; The living wear a kinder smile , the remnant that is left of them .</p>
     <p>Though on the once unfurrowed brows the harrow - teeth of Time may show , Though all the strain of crippling years the halting feet of rhyme may show , We look and hear with melting hearts , for what we all remember is The morn of Spring , nor heed how chill the sky of gray November is .</p>
     <p>Thanks to the gracious powers above from all mankind that singled us , And dropped the pearl of friendship in the cup they kindly mingled us , And bound us in a wreath of flowers with hoops of steel knit under it ;— Nor time , nor space , nor chance , nor change , nor death himself shall sunder it !</p>

       <l n="1">HAVE you heard of the wonderful one-hoss shay ,</l>
       <l n="2">That was built in such a logical way</l>
       <l n="3">It ran a hundred years to a day ,</l>
       <l n="4">And then , of a sudden , it — ah , but stay ,</l>
       <l n="5">I ‘ ll tell you what happened without delay ,</l>
       <l n="6">Scaring the parson into fits ,</l>
       <l n="7">Frightening people out of their wits ,—</l>
       <l n="8">Have you ever heard of that , I say ?</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="9">Seventeen hundred and fifty-five .</l>
       <l n="10">Georgius Secundus was then alive ,—</l>
       <l n="11">Snuffy old drone from the German hive .</l>
       <l n="12">That was the year when Lisbon-town</l>
       <l n="13">Saw the earth open and gulp her down ,</l>
       <l n="14">And Braddock 's army was done so brown ,</l>
       <l n="15">Left without a scalp to its crown .</l>
       <l n="16">It was on the terrible Earthquake-day</l>
       <l n="17">That the Deacon finished the one-hoss shay .</l>

       <l n="18">Now in building of chaises , I tell you what ,</l>
       <l n="19">There is always somewhere a weakest spot ,—</l>
       <l n="20">In hub , tire , felloe , in spring or thill ,</l>
       <l n="21">In panel , or crossbar , or floor , or sill ,</l>
       <l n="22">In screw , bolt , thoroughbrace ,— lurking still ,</l>
       <l n="23">Find it somewhere you must and will ,—</l>
       <l n="24">Above or below , or within or without ,—</l>
       <l n="25">And that ‘ s the reason , beyond a doubt ,</l>
       <l n="26">That a chaise breaks down , but does  n't wear out .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="27">But the Deacon swore ( as Deacons do ,</l>
       <l n="28">With an “ I dew vum , ” or an “ I tell yeou “ )</l>
       <l n="29">He would build one shay to beat the taown</l>
       <l n="30">‘ n ’ the keounty ‘ n ’ all the kentry raoun ’ ;</l>
       <l n="31">It should be so built that it couldn ’ break daown</l>
       <l n="32">“ Fur , ” said the Deacon , “ ‘ t ‘ s mighty plain</l>
       <l n="33">Thut the weakes ’ place mus ’ stan ’ the strain ;</l>
       <l n="34">‘ n ’ the way t ’ fix it , uz I maintain ,</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="37">So the Deacon inquired of the village folk</l>
       <l n="38">Where he could find the strongest oak ,</l>
       <l n="39">That could n't be split nor bent nor broke ,—</l>
       <l n="40">That was for spokes and floor and sills ;</l>
       <l n="41">He sent for lancewood to make the thills ;</l>
       <l n="42">The crossbars were ash , from the straightest trees ,</l>
       <l n="43">The panels of white-wood , that cuts like cheese ,</l>
       <l n="44">But lasts like iron for things like these ;</l>
       <l n="45">The hubs of logs from the “ Settler 's ellum , ” —</l>
       <l n="46">Last of its timber ,— they could  n't sell ‘ em ,</l>
       <l n="47">Never an axe had seen their chips ,</l>
       <l n="48">And the wedges flew from between their lips ,</l>
       <l n="49">Their blunt ends frizzled like celery-tips ;</l>
       <l n="50">Step and prop-iron , bolt and screw ,</l>

       <l n="54">Boot , top , dasher , from tough old hide</l>
       <l n="55">Found in the pit when the tanner died .</l>
       <l n="56">That was the way he “ put her through . ”</l>

       <l n="58">Do ! I tell you , I rather guess</l>
       <l n="59">She was a wonder , and nothing less !</l>
       <l n="60">Colts grew horses , beards turned gray ,</l>
       <l n="61">Deacon and deaconess dropped away ,</l>
       <l n="62">Children and grandchildren — where were they ?</l>

       <l n="49">Married one of the Mathers ’ folk ;</l>
       <l n="50">Got with his wife a chair of oak ,—</l>
       <l n="51">Funny old chair with seat like wedge ,</l>
       <l n="52">Sharp behind and broad front edge ,—</l>
       <l n="53">One of the oddest of human things ,</l>
       <l n="54">Turned all over with knobs and rings ,—</l>
       <l n="55">But heavy , and wide , and deep , and grand ,—</l>
       <l n="56">Fit for the worthies of the land ,—</l>
       <l n="57">Chief Justice Sewall a cause to try in ,</l>
       <l n="58">Or Cotton Mather to sit — and lie — in .</l>
       <l n="59">Parson Turell bequeathed the same</l>
       <l n="60">To a certain student ,— SMITH by name ;</l>
       <l n="61">These were the terms , as we are told :</l>
       <l n="62">“ Saide Smith saide Chaire to have and holde ;</l>

       <l n="69">“ But one Crown lesse then he gave to claime ,</l>
       <l n="70">That being his Debte for use of same . ”</l>
       <l n="71">Smith transferred it to one of the BROWNS ,</l>
       <l n="72">And took his money ,— five silver crowns .</l>
       <l n="73">Brown delivered it up to MOORE ,</l>
       <l n="74">Who paid , it is plain , not five , but four .</l>
       <l n="75">Moore made over the chair to LEE ,</l>
       <l n="76">Who gave him crowns of silver three .</l>
       <l n="77">Lee conveyed it unto DREW ,</l>
       <l n="78">And now the payment , of course , was two .</l>
       <l n="79">Drew gave up the chair to DUNN ,—</l>
       <l n="80">All he got , as you see , was one .</l>
       <l n="81">Dunn released the chair to HALL ,</l>
       <l n="82">And got by the bargain no crown at all .</l>
       <l n="83">And now it passed to a second BROWN ,</l>
       <l n="84">Who took it and likewise claimed a crown .</l>
       <l n="85">When Brown conveyed it unto WARE ,</l>
       <l n="86">Having had one crown , to make it fair ,</l>
       <l n="87">He paid him two crowns to take the chair ;</l>

       <l n="89">He paid one POTTER , who took it , three .</l>
       <l n="90">Four got ROBINSON ; five got Dix ;</l>
       <l n="91">JOHNSON primus demanded six ;</l>
       <l n="92">And so the sum kept gathering still</l>
       <l n="93">Till after the battle of Bunker 's Hill .</l>

       <l n="94">When paper money became so cheap ,</l>

       <l n="100">Eightscore pounds , but would have ten ;</l>
       <l n="101">Nine , I think , was the sum he took ,—</l>
       <l n="102">Not quite certain ,— but see the book .</l>
       <l n="103">By and by the wars were still ,</l>
       <l n="104">But nothing had altered the Parson 's will .</l>
       <l n="105">The old arm-chair was solid yet ,</l>
       <l n="106">But saddled with such a monstrous debt !</l>
       <l n="107">Things grew quite too bad to bear ,</l>
       <l n="108">Paying such sums to get rid of the chair</l>
       <l n="109">But dead men 's fingers hold awful tight ,</l>
       <l n="110">And there was the will in black and white ,</l>
       <l n="111">Plain enough for a child to spell .</l>
       <l n="112">What should be done no man could tell ,</l>
       <l n="113">For the chair was a kind of nightmare curse ,</l>
       <l n="114">And every season but made it worse .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="115">As a last resort , to clear the doubt ,</l>

       <l n="120">French horns whinnied and trumpets blew ,</l>
       <l n="121">The yellow fifes whistled between their teeth ,</l>
       <l n="122">And the bumble-bee bass-drums boomed beneath ;</l>
       <l n="123">So he rode with all his band ,</l>
       <l n="124">Till the President met him , cap in hand .</l>
       <l n="125">The Governor “ hefted ” the crowns , and said ,—</l>

      <head>HOMESICK IN HEAVEN</head>
      <head>THE DIVINE VOICE Go seek thine earth-born sisters ,— thus the Voice That all obey ,— the sad and silent three ; These only , while the hosts of Heaven rejoice , Smile never ; ask them what their sorrows be ;</head>
       <l n="1">And when the secret of their griefs they tell ,</l>
       <l n="2">Look on them with thy mild , half-human eyes ;</l>
       <l n="3">Say what thou wast on earth ; thou knowest well ;</l>
       <l n="4">So shall they cease from unavailing sighs .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>THE ANGEL Why thus , apart ,— the swift-winged herald spake ,— Sit ye with silent lips and unstrung lyres While the trisagion 's blending chords awake In shouts of joy from all the heavenly choirs ?</p>
     <p>FIRST SPIRIT Chide not thy sisters ,— thus the answer came ;— Children of earth , our half-weaned nature clings To earth 's fond memories , and her whispered name Untunes our quivering lips , our saddened strings ;</p>
     <lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">For there we loved , and where we love is home ,</l>
       <l n="2">Home that our feet may leave , but not our hearts ,</l>
       <l n="3">Though o'er us shine the jasper-lighted dome :—</l>
       <l n="4">The chain may lengthen , but it never parts !</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="5">Sometimes a sunlit sphere comes rolling by ,</l>
       <l n="6">And then we softly whisper ,— can it be ?</l>
       <l n="7">And leaning toward the silvery orb , we try</l>

       <l n="12">The blinding splendors and the changeless blue .</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>THE ANGEL Nay , sister , nay ! a single healing leaf Plucked from the bough of yon twelve-fruited tree Would soothe such anguish ,— deeper stabbing grief Has pierced thy throbbing heart —</p>
     <p>THE FIRST SPIRIT Ah , woe is me ! I from my clinging babe was rudely torn ; His tender lips a loveless bosom pressed ; Can I forget him in my life new born ? Oh that my darling lay upon my breast !</p>
     <p>THE ANGEL And thou ?—</p>
     <p>THE SECOND SPIRIT I was a fair and youthful bride , The kiss of love still burns upon my cheek , He whom I worshipped , ever at my side ,— Him through the spirit realm in vain I seek .</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">Sweet faces turn their beaming eyes on mine ;</l>
       <l n="2">Ah ! not in these the wished-for look I read ;</l>
       <l n="3">Still for that one dear human smile I pine ;</l>
       <l n="4">Thou and none other !— is the lover 's creed .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>THE ANGEL And whence thy sadness in a world of bliss Where never parting comes , nor mourner 's tear ? Art thou , too , dreaming of a mortal 's kiss Amid the seraphs of the heavenly sphere ?</p>
     <p>THE THIRD SPIRIT Nay , tax not me with passion 's wasting fire ; When the swift message set my spirit free , Blind , helpless , lone , I left my gray-haired sire ; My friends were many , he had none save me .</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">I left him , orphaned , in the starless night ;</l>
       <l n="2">Alas , for him no cheerful morning 's dawn</l>
       <l n="3">I wear the ransomed spirit 's robe of white ,</l>
       <l n="4">Yet still I hear him moaning , She is gone !</l>
     </lg>

       <l n="13">A walk in the moonlight has pleasures , I own ,</l>

       <l n="1">ANOTHER clouded night ; the stars are hid ,</l>
       <l n="2">The orb that waits my search is hid with them .</l>
       <l n="3">Patience ! Why grudge an hour , a month , a year ,</l>
       <l n="4">To plant my ladder and to gain the round</l>

       <l n="15">In the dark mines of unaccomplished time</l>
       <l n="16">Yet to be stamped with morning 's royal die</l>

       <l n="25">Here glows the God of Battles ; this recalls</l>
       <l n="26">The Lord of Ocean , and yon far-off sphere</l>
       <l n="27">The Sire of Him who gave his ancient name</l>
       <l n="28">To the dim planet with the wondrous rings ;</l>
       <l n="29">Here flames the Queen of Beauty 's silver lamp ,</l>

       <l n="31">But this , unseen through all earth 's ions past ,</l>
       <l n="32">A youth who watched beneath the western star</l>
       <l n="33">Sought in the darkness , found , and shewed to men ;</l>
       <l n="34">Linked with his name thenceforth and evermore</l>

       <l n="46">Where worlds beyond the world their mingling rays</l>
       <l n="47">Blend in soft white ,— a cloud that , born of earth ,</l>

       <l n="50">On each poor grain he lent to build the reef ,</l>
       <l n="51">As Babel 's builders stamped their sunburnt clay ,</l>
       <l n="52">Or deem his patient service all in vain ?</l>
       <l n="53">What if another sit beneath the shade</l>
       <l n="54">Of the broad elm I planted by the way ,—</l>
       <l n="55">What if another heed the beacon light</l>
       <l n="56">I set upon the rock that wrecked my keel ,—</l>
       <l n="57">Have I not done my task and served my kind ?</l>
       <l n="58">Nay , rather act thy part , unnamed , unknown ,</l>
       <l n="59">And let Fame blow her trumpet through the world</l>
       <l n="60">With noisy wind to swell a fool 's renown ,</l>
       <l n="61">Joined with some truth he stumbled blindly o'er ,</l>
       <l n="62">Or coupled with some single shining deed</l>
       <l n="63">That in the great account of all his days</l>
       <l n="64">Will stand alone upon the bankrupt sheet</l>
       <l n="65">His pitying angel shows the clerk of Heaven .</l>
       <l n="66">The noblest service comes from nameless hands ,</l>
       <l n="67">And the best servant does his work unseen .</l>
       <l n="68">Who found the seeds of fire and made them shoot ,</l>
       <l n="69">Fed by his breath , in buds and flowers of flame ?</l>
       <l n="70">Who forged in roaring flames the ponderous stone ,</l>
       <l n="71">And shaped the moulded metal to his need ?</l>
       <l n="72">Who gave the dragging car its rolling wheel ,</l>
       <l n="73">And tamed the steed that whirls its circling round ?</l>
       <l n="74">All these have left their work and not their names ,—</l>
       <l n="75">Why should I murmur at a fate like theirs ?</l>
       <l n="76">This is the heavenly light ; the pearly stain</l>
       <l n="77">Was but a wind-cloud drifting o'er the stars !</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">LET me retrace the record of the years</l>
       <l n="2">That made me what I am . A man most wise ,</l>
       <l n="3">But overworn with toil and bent with age ,</l>
       <l n="4">Sought me to be his scholar , - me , run wild</l>
       <l n="5">From books and teachers , - kindled in my soul</l>
       <l n="6">The love of knowledge ; led me to his tower ,</l>
       <l n="7">Showed me the wonders of the midnight realm</l>
       <l n="8">His hollow sceptre ruled , or seemed to rule ,</l>
       <l n="9">Taught me the mighty secrets of the spheres ,</l>
       <l n="10">Trained me to find the glimmering specks of light</l>
       <l n="11">Beyond the unaided sense , and on my chart</l>
       <l n="12">To string them one by one , in order due ,</l>
       <l n="13">As on a rosary a saint his beads .</l>
       <l n="14">I was his only scholar ; I became</l>
       <l n="15">The echo to his thought ; whate'er he knew</l>
       <l n="16">Was mine for asking ; so from year to year</l>
       <l n="17">W e wrought together , till there came a time</l>
       <l n="18">When I , the learner , was the master half</l>
       <l n="19">Of the twinned being in the dome-crowned tower .</l>

       <l n="20">Minds roll in paths like planets ; they revolve ,</l>
       <l n="21">This in a larger , that a narrower ring ,</l>
       <l n="22">But round they come at last to that same phase ,</l>
       <l n="23">That selfsame light and shade they showed before .</l>
       <l n="24">I learned his annual and his monthly tale ,</l>
       <l n="25">His weekly axiom and his daily phrase ,</l>
       <l n="26">I felt them coming in the laden air ,</l>
       <l n="27">And watched them laboring up to vocal breath ,</l>
       <l n="28">Even as the first-born at his father 's board</l>
       <l n="29">Knows ere he speaks the too familiar jest</l>
       <l n="30">Is on its way , by some mysterious sign</l>
       <l n="31">Forewarned , the click before the striking bell .</l>

       <l n="32">He shrivelled as I spread my growing leaves ,</l>
       <l n="33">Till trust and reverence changed to pitying care ;</l>
       <l n="34">He lived for me in what he once had been ,</l>
       <l n="35">But I for him , a shadow , a defence ,</l>
       <l n="36">The guardian of his fame , his guide , his staff ,</l>
       <l n="37">Leaned on so long he fell if left alone .</l>
       <l n="38">I was his eye , his ear , his cunning hand ,</l>
       <l n="39">Love was my spur and longing after fame ,</l>
       <l n="40">But his the goading thorn of sleepless age</l>
       <l n="41">That sees its shortening span , its lengthening shades ,</l>
       <l n="42">That clutches what it may with eager grasp ,</l>
       <l n="43">And drops at last with empty , outstretched hands .</l>
       <l n="44">All this he dreamed not . He would sit him down</l>
       <l n="45">Thinking to work his problems as of old ,</l>
       <l n="46">And find the star he thought so plain a blur ,</l>
       <l n="47">The columned figures labyrinthine wilds</l>
       <l n="48">Without my comment , blind and senseless scrawls</l>
       <l n="49">That vexed him with their riddles ; he would strive</l>
       <l n="50">And struggle for a while , and then his eye</l>
       <l n="51">Would lose its light , and over all his mind</l>
       <l n="52">The cold gray mist would settle ; and erelong</l>
       <l n="53">The darkness fell , and I was left alone .</l>

       <l n="1">ALONE ! no climber of an Alpine cliff ,</l>
       <l n="2">No Arctic venturer on the waveless sea ,</l>
       <l n="3">Feels the dread stillness round him as it chills</l>
       <l n="4">The heart of him who leaves the slumbering earth</l>
       <l n="5">To watch the silent worlds that crowd the sky .</l>
       <l n="6">Alone ! And as the shepherd leaves his flock</l>
       <l n="7">To feed upon the hillside , he meanwhile</l>
       <l n="8">Finds converse in the warblings of the pipe</l>
       <l n="9">Himself has fashioned for his vacant hour ,</l>
       <l n="10">So have I grown companion to myself ,</l>
       <l n="11">And to the wandering spirits of the air</l>
       <l n="12">That smile and whisper round us in our dreams .</l>
       <l n="13">Thus have I learned to search if I may know</l>
       <l n="14">The whence and why of all beneath the stars</l>
       <l n="15">And all beyond them , and to weigh my life</l>
       <l n="16">As in a balance ,— poising good and ill</l>
       <l n="17">Against each other ,— asking of the Power</l>
       <l n="18">That flung me forth among the whirling worlds ,</l>
       <l n="19">If I am heir to any inborn right ,</l>
       <l n="20">Or only as an atom of the dust</l>
       <l n="21">That every wind may blow where'er it will .</l>

       <l n="7">Sweet was thy song , but sweeter now</l>
       <l n="8">Thy carol on the leafless bough .</l>

       <l n="14">The budding April bowers would fill ,</l>
       <l n="15">Nor passed its joyous tones away</l>
       <l n="16">When April rounded into May :</l>
       <l n="17">Thy life shall hail no second dawn ,—</l>

       <l n="23">With answering notes the woodland rung ,</l>
       <l n="24">And every tree-top found a tongue .</l>

      <head>DOROTHY Q .</head>
      <head>A FAMILY PORTRAIT</head>
      <head>I cannot tell the story of Dorothy Q. more simply in prose than I have told it in verse , but I can add something to it . Dorothy was the daughter of Judge Edmund Quincy , and the niece of Josiah Quincy , junior , the young patriot and orator who died just before the American Revolution , of which he was one of the most eloquent and effective promoters . The son of the latter , Josiah Quincy , the first mayor of Boston bearing that name , lived to a great age , one of the most useful and honored citizens of his time . The canvas of the painting was so much decayed that it had to be replaced by a new one , in doing which the rapier thrust was of course filled up .</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">GRANDMOTHER 'S mother : her age , I guess ,</l>
       <l n="2">Thirteen summers , or something less ;</l>
       <l n="3">Girlish bust , but womanly air ;</l>
       <l n="4">Smooth , square forehead with uprolled hair ;</l>
       <l n="5">Lips that lover has never kissed ;</l>
       <l n="6">Taper fingers and slender wrist ;</l>
       <l n="7">Hanging sleeves of stiff brocade ;</l>
       <l n="8">So they painted the little maid .</l>

       <l n="12">Look ! there 's a rent the light shines through ,</l>

       <l n="1">WHILE far along the eastern sky</l>
       <l n="2">I saw the flags of Havoc fly ,</l>

       <l n="14">Where peaceful morning loves to rise ,</l>
       <l n="15">As if the sun had lost his way</l>
       <l n="16">And dawned to make a second day ,—</l>

       <l n="23">Our northern queen in glory shone</l>
       <l n="24">With new-born splendors not her own ,</l>

       <l n="47">But Faith that soars to seek the sky</l>
       <l n="48">Shall teach our half-fledged souls to fly ,</l>
       <l n="49">And find , beyond the smoke and flame ,</l>
       <l n="50">The cloudless azure whence they came !</l>

       <l n="1">FOUR summers coined their golden light in leaves ,</l>
       <l n="2">Four wasteful autumns flung them to the gale ,</l>

      <head>A SEA DIALOGUE</head>
       <l n="1">Cabin Passenger . Man at Wheel .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>CABIN PASSENGER . FRIEND , you seem thoughtful . I not wonder much That he who sails the ocean should be sad . I am myself reflective . When I think Of all this wallowing beast , the Sea , has sucked Between his sharp , thin lips , the wedgy waves , What heaps of diamonds , rubies , emeralds , pearls ; What piles of shekels , talents , ducats , crowns , What bales of Tyrian mantles , Indian shawls , Of laces that have blanked the weavers ’ eyes , Of silken tissues , wrought by worm and man , The half-starved workman , and the well-fed worm ; What marbles , bronzes , pictures , parchments , books ; What many-lobuled , thought-engendering brains ; Lie with the gaping sea-shells in his maw ,— I , too , am silent ; for all language seems A mockery , and the speech of man is vain . O mariner , we look upon the waves And they rebuke our babbling . “ Peace ! ” they say ,— “ Mortal , be still ! ” My noisy tongue is hushed , And with my trembling finger on my lips My soul exclaims in ecstasy —</p>
     <p>MAN AT WHEEL . Belay !</p>
     <p>CABIN PASSENGER . Ah yes ! “ Delay , ” — it calls , “ nor haste to break The charm of stillness with an idle word ! ” O mariner , I love thee , for thy thought Strides even with my own , nay , flies before . Thou art a brother to the wind and wave ; Have they not music for thine ear as mine , When the wild tempest makes thy ship his lyre , Smiting a cavernous basso from the shrouds And climbing up his gamut through the stays , Through buntlines , bowlines , ratlines , till it shrills An alto keener than the locust sings , And all the great Aeolian orchestra Storms out its mad sonata in the gale ? Is not the scene a wondrous and —</p>
     <p>MAN AT WHEEL . A vast !</p>
     <p>CABIN PASSENGER . Ah yes , a vast , a vast and wondrous scene ! I see thy soul is open as the day That holds the sunshine in its azure bowl To all the solemn glories of the deep . Tell me , O mariner , dost thou never feel The grandeur of thine office ,— to control The keel that cuts the ocean like a knife And leaves a wake behind it like a seam In the great shining garment of the world ?</p>
     <p>MAN AT WHEEL . Belay y'r jaw , y ’ swab ! y ’ hoss-marine ! ( To the Captain . ) Ay , ay , Sir ! Stiddy , Sir ! Sou'wes ’ b ’ sou ’ !</p>

      <head>GRANDMOTHER 'S STORY OF BUNKER-HILL BATTLE</head>
      <head>AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">‘ T is like stirring living embers when , at eighty , one remembers</l>
       <l n="2">All the achings and the quakings of “ the times that tried men 's souls ” ;</l>
       <l n="3">When I talk of Whig and Tory , when I tell the Rebel story ,</l>
       <l n="4">To you the words are ashes , but to me they 're burning coals .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="5">I had heard the muskets ’ rattle of the April running battle ;</l>
       <l n="6">Lord Percy 's hunted soldiers , I can see their red-coats still ;</l>
       <l n="7">But a deadly chill comes o'er me , as the day looms up before me ,</l>
       <l n="8">When a thousand men lay bleeding on the slopes of Bunker 's Hill .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="9">‘ T was a peaceful summer 's morning , when the first thing gave us warning</l>
       <l n="10">Was the booming of the cannon from the river and the shore :</l>
       <l n="11">“ Child , ” says grandma , “ what ‘ s the matter , what is all this noise and</l>
       <l n="12">clatter ?</l>
       <l n="13">Have those scalping Indian devils come to murder us once more ? ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="14">Poor old soul ! my sides were shaking in the midst of all my quaking ,</l>
       <l n="15">To hear her talk of Indians when the guns began to roar :</l>
       <l n="16">She had seen the burning village , and the slaughter and the pillage ,</l>
       <l n="17">When the Mohawks killed her father with their bullets through his door .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="18">Then I said , “ Now , dear old granny , do n't you fret and worry any ,</l>
       <l n="19">For I 'll soon come back and tell you whether this is work or play ;</l>
       <l n="20">There can n't be mischief in it , so I wo n't be gone a minute ” —</l>
       <l n="21">For a minute then I started . I was gone the live-long day .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="22">No time for bodice-lacing or for looking-glass grimacing ;</l>
       <l n="23">Down my hair went as I hurried , tumbling half-way to my heels ;</l>
       <l n="24">God forbid your ever knowing , when there 's blood around her flowing ,</l>
       <l n="25">How the lonely , helpless daughter of a quiet house-hold feels !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="26">In the street I heard a thumping ; and I knew it was the stumping</l>
       <l n="27">Of the Corporal , our old neighbor , on that wooden leg he wore ,</l>
       <l n="28">With a knot of women round him , - it was lucky I had found him ,</l>
       <l n="29">So I followed with the others , and the Corporal marched before .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="30">They were making for the steeple ,— the old soldier and his people ;</l>
       <l n="31">The pigeons circled round us as we climbed the creaking stair .</l>
       <l n="32">Just across the narrow river — oh , so close it made me shiver !—</l>
       <l n="33">Stood a fortress on the hill-top that but yesterday was bare .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="9">
       <l n="34">Not slow our eyes to find it ; well we knew who stood behind it ,</l>
       <l n="35">Though the earthwork hid them from us , and the stubborn walls were dumb</l>
       <l n="36">Here were sister , wife , and mother , looking wild upon each other ,</l>
       <l n="37">And their lips were white with terror as they said , THE HOUR HAS COME !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="10">
       <l n="38">The morning slowly wasted , not a morsel had we tasted ,</l>
       <l n="39">And our heads were almost splitting with the cannons ’ deafening thrill ,</l>
       <l n="40">When a figure tall and stately round the rampart strode sedately ;</l>
       <l n="41">It was PRESCOTT , one since told me ; he commanded on the hill .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="11">
       <l n="42">Every woman 's heart grew bigger when we saw his manly figure ,</l>
       <l n="43">With the banyan buckled round it , standing up so straight and tall ;</l>
       <l n="44">Like a gentleman of leisure who is strolling out for pleasure ,</l>
       <l n="45">Through the storm of shells and cannon-shot he walked around the wall .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="12">
       <l n="46">At eleven the streets were swarming , for the red-coats ’ ranks were</l>
       <l n="47">forming ;</l>
       <l n="48">At noon in marching order they were moving to the piers ;</l>
       <l n="49">How the bayonets gleamed and glistened , as we looked far down , and</l>
       <l n="50">listened</l>
       <l n="51">To the trampling and the drum-beat of the belted grenadiers !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="13">
       <l n="52">At length the men have started , with a cheer ( it seemed faint-hearted ) ,</l>
       <l n="53">In their scarlet regimentals , with their knapsacks on their backs ,</l>
       <l n="54">And the reddening , rippling water , as after a sea-fight 's slaughter ,</l>
       <l n="55">Round the barges gliding onward blushed like blood along their tracks .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="14">
       <l n="56">So they crossed to the other border , and again they formed in order ;</l>
       <l n="57">And the boats came back for soldiers , came for soldiers , soldiers still :</l>
       <l n="58">The time seemed everlasting to us women faint and fasting ,—</l>
       <l n="59">At last they 're moving , marching , marching proudly up the hill .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="15">
       <l n="60">We can see the bright steel glancing all along the lines advancing ,—</l>
       <l n="61">Now the front rank fires a volley ,— they have thrown away their shot ;</l>
       <l n="62">For behind their earthwork lying , all the balls above them flying ,</l>
       <l n="63">Our people need not hurry ; so they wait and answer not .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="16">
       <l n="64">Then the Corporal , our old cripple ( he would swear sometimes and tipple ) ,</l>
       <l n="65">He had heard the bullets whistle ( in the old French war ) before ,—</l>
       <l n="66">Calls out in words of jeering , just as if they all were hearing ,—</l>
       <l n="67">And his wooden leg thumps fiercely on the dusty belfry floor :—</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="17">
       <l n="68">“ Oh ! fire away , ye villains , and earn King George 's shillin 's ,</l>
       <l n="69">But ye ‘ ll waste a ton of powder afore a ‘ rebel ’ falls ;</l>
       <l n="70">You may bang the dirt and welcome , they 're as safe as Dan'l Malcolm</l>
       <l n="71">Ten foot beneath the gravestone that you 've splintered with your balls ! ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="18">
       <l n="72">In the hush of expectation , in the awe and trepidation</l>
       <l n="73">Of the dread approaching moment , we are well-nigh breathless all ;</l>
       <l n="74">Though the rotten bars are failing on the rickety belfry railing ,</l>
       <l n="75">We are crowding up against them like the waves against a wall .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="19">
       <l n="76">Just a glimpse ( the air is clearer ) , they are nearer ,— nearer ,— nearer ,</l>
       <l n="77">When a flash — a curling smoke-wreath — then a crash — the steeple shakes —</l>
       <l n="78">The deadly truce is ended ; the tempest 's shroud is rended ;</l>
       <l n="79">Like a morning mist it gathered , like a thunder-cloud it breaks !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="20">
       <l n="80">Oh the sight our eyes discover as the blue-black smoke blows over !</l>
       <l n="81">The red-coats stretched in windrows as a mower rakes his hay ;</l>
       <l n="82">Here a scarlet heap is lying , there a headlong crowd is flying</l>
       <l n="83">Like a billow that has broken and is shivered into spray .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="21">
       <l n="84">Then we cried , “ The troops are routed ! they are beat — it can n't be</l>
       <l n="85">doubted !</l>
       <l n="86">God be thanked , the fight is over ! ” — Ah ! the grim old soldier 's smile !</l>
       <l n="87">“ Tell us , tell us why you look so ? ” ( we could hardly speak , we shook so ) ,</l>
       <l n="88">“ Are they beaten ? Are they beaten ? ARE they beaten ? ” — “ Wait a while . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="22">
       <l n="89">Oh the trembling and the terror ! for too soon we saw our error :</l>
       <l n="90">They are baffled , not defeated ; we have driven them back in vain ;</l>
       <l n="91">And the columns that were scattered , round the colors that were tattered ,</l>
       <l n="92">Toward the sullen , silent fortress turn their belted breasts again .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="23">
       <l n="93">All at once , as we are gazing , lo the roofs of Charlestown blazing !</l>
       <l n="94">They have fired the harmless village ; in an hour it will be down !</l>
       <l n="95">The Lord in heaven confound them , rain his fire and brimstone round them ,</l>
       <l n="96">The robbing , murdering red-coats , that would burn a peaceful town !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="24">
       <l n="97">They are marching , stern and solemn ; we can see each massive column</l>
       <l n="98">As they near the naked earth-mound with the slanting walls so steep .</l>
       <l n="99">Have our soldiers got faint-hearted , and in noiseless haste departed ?</l>
       <l n="100">Are they panic-struck and helpless ? Are they palsied or asleep ?</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="25">
       <l n="101">Now ! the walls they 're almost under ! scarce a rod the foes asunder !</l>
       <l n="102">Not a firelock flashed against them ! up the earth-work they will swarm !</l>
       <l n="103">But the words have scarce been spoken , when the ominous calm is broken ,</l>
       <l n="104">And a bellowing crash has emptied all the vengeance of the storm !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="26">
       <l n="105">So again , with murderous slaughter , pelted backwards to the water ,</l>
       <l n="106">Fly Pigot 's running heroes and the frightened braves of Howe ;</l>
       <l n="107">And we shout , “ At last they 're done for , it 's their barges they have run</l>
       <l n="108">for :</l>
       <l n="109">They are beaten , beaten , beaten ; and the battle ‘ s over now ! ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="27">
       <l n="110">And we looked , poor timid creatures , on the rough old soldier 's features ,</l>
       <l n="111">Our lips afraid to question , but he knew what we would ask :</l>
       <l n="112">“ Not sure , ” he said ; “ keep quiet ,— once more , I guess , they ‘ ll try it —</l>
       <l n="113">Here 's damnation to the cut-throats ! ” — then he handed me his flask ,</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="28">
       <l n="114">Saying , “ Gal , you 're looking shaky ; have a drop of old Jamaiky ;</l>
       <l n="115">I ‘ m afeard there ‘ ll be more trouble afore the job is done ” ;</l>
       <l n="116">So I took one scorching swallow ; dreadful faint I felt and hollow ,</l>
       <l n="117">Standing there from early morning when the firing was begun .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="29">
       <l n="118">All through those hours of trial I had watched a calm clock dial ,</l>
       <l n="119">As the hands kept creeping , creeping ,— they were creeping round to four ,</l>
       <l n="120">When the old man said , “ They 're forming with their bagonets fixed for</l>
       <l n="121">storming :</l>
       <l n="122">It ‘ s the death-grip that 's a coming ,— they will try the works once</l>
       <l n="123">more . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="30">
       <l n="124">With brazen trumpets blaring , the flames behind them glaring ,</l>
       <l n="125">The deadly wall before them , in close array they come ;</l>
       <l n="126">Still onward , upward toiling , like a dragon 's fold uncoiling ,—</l>
       <l n="127">Like the rattlesnake 's shrill warning the reverberating drum .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="31">
       <l n="128">Over heaps all torn and gory — shall I tell the fearful story ,</l>
       <l n="129">How they surged above the breastwork , as a sea breaks over a deck ;</l>
       <l n="130">How , driven , yet scarce defeated , our worn-out men retreated ,</l>
       <l n="131">With their powder-horns all emptied , like the swimmers from a wreck ?</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="32">
       <l n="132">It has all been told and painted ; as for me , they say I fainted ,</l>
       <l n="133">And the wooden-legged old Corporal stumped with me down the stair :</l>
       <l n="134">When I woke from dreams affrighted the evening lamps were lighted ,—</l>
       <l n="135">On the floor a youth was lying ; his bleeding breast was bare .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="33">
       <l n="136">And I heard through all the flurry , “ Send for WARREN ! hurry ! hurry !</l>
       <l n="137">Tell him here 's a soldier bleeding , and he ‘ ll come and dress his</l>
       <l n="138">wound ! ”</l>
       <l n="139">Ah , we knew not till the morrow told its tale of death and sorrow ,</l>
       <l n="140">How the starlight found him stiffened on the dark and bloody ground .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="34">
       <l n="141">Who the youth was , what his name was , where the place from which he came</l>
       <l n="142">was ,</l>
       <l n="143">Who had brought him from the battle , and had left him at our door ,</l>
       <l n="144">He could not speak to tell us ; but ‘ t was one of our brave fellows ,</l>
       <l n="145">As the homespun plainly showed us which the dying soldier wore .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="35">
       <l n="146">For they all thought he was dying , as they gathered round him crying ,—</l>
       <l n="147">And they said , “ Oh , how they 'll miss him ! ” and , “ What will his mother</l>
       <l n="148">do ? ”</l>
       <l n="149">Then , his eyelids just unclosing like a child 's that has been dozing ,</l>
       <l n="150">He faintly murmured , “ Mother ! ” — and — I saw his eyes were blue .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="36">
       <l n="151">“ Why , grandma , how you ‘ re winking ! ” Ah , my child , it sets me thinking</l>
       <l n="152">Of a story not like this one . Well , he somehow lived along ;</l>
       <l n="153">So we came to know each other , and I nursed him like a — mother ,</l>
       <l n="154">Till at last he stood before me , tall , and rosy-checked , and strong .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="37">
       <l n="155">And we sometimes walked together in the pleasant summer weather ,—</l>
       <l n="156">“ Please to tell us what his name was ? ” Just your own , my little dear ,—</l>
       <l n="157">There 's his picture Copley painted : we became so well acquainted ,</l>
       <l n="158">That — in short , that 's why I ‘ m grandma , and you children all are here !</l>

      <head>AT THE “ ATLANTIC ” DINNER</head>
      <head>DECEMBER 15 , 1874</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">I SUPPOSE it 's myself that you 're making allusion to</l>
       <l n="2">And bringing the sense of dismay and confusion to .</l>
       <l n="3">Of course some must speak ,— they are always selected to ,</l>
       <l n="4">But pray what 's the reason that I am expected to ?</l>
       <l n="5">I 'm not fond of wasting my breath as those fellows do ;</l>

       <l n="7">Their legs are uneasy , but why will you jog any</l>
       <l n="8">That long to stay quiet beneath the mahogany ?</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="9">Why , why call me up with your battery of flatteries ?</l>
       <l n="10">You say “ He writes poetry , ” — that ‘ s what the matter is</l>
       <l n="11">“ It costs him no trouble — a pen full of ink or two</l>
       <l n="12">And the poem is done in the time of a wink or two ;</l>
       <l n="13">As for thoughts — never mind — take the ones that lie uppermost ,</l>
       <l n="14">And the rhymes used by Milton and Byron and Tupper most ;</l>
       <l n="15">The lines come so easy ! at one end he jingles ‘ em ,</l>
       <l n="16">At the other with capital letters he shingles ‘ em ,—</l>
       <l n="17">Why , the thing writes itself , and before he 's half done with it</l>
       <l n="18">He hates to stop writing , he has such good fun with it ! ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="19">Ah , that is the way in which simple ones go about</l>
       <l n="20">And draw a fine picture of things they do n't know about !</l>
       <l n="21">We all know a kitten , but come to a catamount</l>
       <l n="22">The beast is a stranger when grown up to that amount ,</l>
       <l n="23">( A stranger we rather prefer should  n't visit us ,</l>
       <l n="24">A felis whose advent is far from felicitous . )</l>
       <l n="25">The boy who can boast that his trap has just got a mouse</l>
       <l n="26">Must  n't draw it and write underneath “ hippopotamus ” ;</l>

       <l n="1">THE Ship of State ! above her skies are blue ,</l>
       <l n="2">But still she rocks a little , it is true ,</l>
       <l n="3">And there are passengers whose faces white</l>
       <l n="4">Show they do n't feel as happy as they might ;</l>
       <l n="5">Yet on the whole her crew are quite content ,</l>
       <l n="6">Since its wild fury the typhoon has spent ,</l>
       <l n="7">And willing , if her pilot thinks it best ,</l>
       <l n="8">To head a little nearer south by west .</l>
       <l n="9">And this they feel : the ship came too near wreck ,</l>
       <l n="10">In the long quarrel for the quarter-deck ,</l>
       <l n="11">Now when she glides serenely on her way ,—</l>
       <l n="12">The shallows past where dread explosives lay ,—</l>
       <l n="13">The stiff obstructive 's churlish game to try</l>
       <l n="14">Let sleeping dogs and still torpedoes lie !</l>
       <l n="15">And so I give you all the Ship of State ;</l>

       <l n="14">The dust that wore the footprints of the dead</l>

       <l n="16">This faded vesture which it calls its own .</l>
       <l n="17">Here sleeps my father 's sire , and they who gave</l>

       <l n="20">Climbed yon long slope ; the sacred spot I found</l>
       <l n="21">Where all unsullied lies the winter snow ,</l>
       <l n="22">Where all ungathered spring 's pale violets blow ,</l>
       <l n="23">And tracked from stone to stone the Saxon name</l>
       <l n="24">That marks the blood I need not blush to claim ,</l>
       <l n="25">Blood such as warmed the Pilgrim sons of toil ,</l>

       <l n="32">Mine the sweet streams that lend their brightening green ;</l>
       <l n="33">I breathed your air — the sunlit landscape smiled ;</l>
       <l n="34">I touch your soil — it knows its children 's child ;</l>
       <l n="35">Throned in my heart your heritage is mine ;</l>

       <l n="39">Far through the vista of the silent years</l>
       <l n="40">I see a venturous band ; the pioneers ,</l>
       <l n="41">Who let the sunlight through the forest 's gloom ,</l>
       <l n="42">Who bade the harvest wave , the garden bloom .</l>
       <l n="43">Hark ! loud resounds the bare-armed settler 's axe ,</l>
       <l n="44">See where the stealthy panther left his tracks !</l>
       <l n="45">As fierce , as stealthy creeps the skulking foe</l>
       <l n="46">With stone-tipped shaft and sinew-corded bow ;</l>
       <l n="47">Soon shall he vanish from his ancient reign ,</l>
       <l n="48">Leave his last cornfield to the coming train ,</l>
       <l n="49">Quit the green margin of the wave he drinks ,</l>

       <l n="131">In proud array a martial band is seen ;</l>
       <l n="132">You know what names those ancient rosters hold ,—</l>
       <l n="133">Whose belts were buckled when the drum-beat rolled ,—</l>
       <l n="134">But mark their Captain ! tell us , who is he ?</l>
       <l n="135">On his brown face that same old look I see</l>
       <l n="136">Yes ! from the homestead 's still retreat he came ,</l>
       <l n="137">Whose peaceful owner bore the Psalmist 's name ;</l>
       <l n="138">The same his own . Well , Israel 's glorious king</l>
       <l n="139">Who struck the harp could also whirl the sling ,—</l>
       <l n="140">Breathe in his song a penitential sigh</l>
       <l n="141">And smite the sons of Amalek hip and thigh :</l>
       <l n="142">These shared their task ; one deaconed out the psalm ,</l>
       <l n="143">One slashed the scalping hell-hounds of calm ;</l>
       <l n="144">The praying father 's pious work is done ,</l>
       <l n="145">Now sword in hand steps forth the fighting son .</l>
       <l n="146">On many a field he fought in wilds afar ;</l>
       <l n="147">See on his swarthy cheek the bullet 's scar !</l>
       <l n="148">There hangs a murderous tomahawk ; beneath ,</l>
       <l n="149">Without its blade , a knife 's embroidered sheath ;</l>
       <l n="150">Save for the stroke his trusty weapon dealt</l>
       <l n="151">His scalp had dangled at their owner 's belt ;</l>
       <l n="152">But not for him such fate ; he lived to see</l>
       <l n="153">The bloodier strife that made our nation free ,</l>
       <l n="154">To serve with willing toil , with skilful hand ,</l>
       <l n="155">The war-worn saviors of the bleeding land .</l>
       <l n="156">His wasting life to others ’ needs he gave ,—</l>
       <l n="157">Sought rest in home and found it in the grave .</l>
       <l n="158">See where the stones life 's brief memorials keep ,</l>
       <l n="159">The tablet telling where he “ fell on sleep , ” —</l>
       <l n="160">Watched by a winged cherub 's rayless eye ,—</l>
       <l n="161">A scroll above that says we all must die ,—</l>
       <l n="162">Those saddening lines beneath , the “ Night-Thoughts ” lent :</l>
       <l n="163">So stands the Soldier 's , Surgeon 's monument .</l>
       <l n="164">Ah ! at a glance my filial eye divines</l>
       <l n="165">The scholar son in those remembered lines .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="166">The Scholar Son . His hand my footsteps led .</l>
       <l n="167">No more the dim unreal past I tread .</l>
       <l n="168">O thou whose breathing form was once so dear ,</l>
       <l n="169">Whose cheering voice was music to my ear ,</l>
       <l n="170">Art thou not with me as my feet pursue</l>
       <l n="171">The village paths so well thy boyhood knew ,</l>
       <l n="172">Along the tangled margin of the stream</l>
       <l n="173">Whose murmurs blended with thine infant dream ,</l>
       <l n="174">Or climb the hill , or thread the wooded vale ,</l>
       <l n="175">Or seek the wave where gleams yon distant sail ,</l>
       <l n="176">Or the old homestead 's narrowed bounds explore ,</l>
       <l n="177">Where sloped the roof that sheds the rains no more ,</l>
       <l n="178">Where one last relic still remains to tell</l>
       <l n="179">Here stood thy home ,— the memory-haunted well ,</l>
       <l n="180">Whose waters quench a deeper thirst than thine ,</l>
       <l n="181">Changed at my lips to sacramental wine ,—</l>
       <l n="182">Art thou not with me , as I fondly trace</l>
       <l n="183">The scanty records of thine honored race ,</l>
       <l n="184">Call up the forms that earlier years have known ,</l>
       <l n="185">And spell the legend of each slanted stone ?</l>
       <l n="186">With thoughts of thee my loving verse began ,</l>
       <l n="187">Not for the critic 's curious eye to scan ,</l>
       <l n="188">Not for the many listeners , but the few</l>
       <l n="189">Whose fathers trod the paths my fathers knew ;</l>
       <l n="190">Still in my heart thy loved remembrance burns ;</l>
       <l n="191">Still to my lips thy cherished name returns ;</l>
       <l n="192">Could I but feel thy gracious presence near</l>
       <l n="193">Amid the groves that once to thee were dear</l>
       <l n="194">Could but my trembling lips with mortal speech</l>
       <l n="195">Thy listening ear for one brief moment reach !</l>
       <l n="196">How vain the dream ! The pallid voyager 's track</l>
       <l n="197">No sign betrays ; he sends no message back .</l>
       <l n="198">No word from thee since evening 's shadow fell</l>
       <l n="199">On thy cold forehead with my long farewell ,—</l>
       <l n="200">Now from the margin of the silent sea ,</l>
       <l n="201">Take my last offering ere I cross to thee !</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="10">
       <l n="35">Still as the silver cord gets worn and slender ,</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="19">
       <l n="71">But , O my gentle sisters , O my brothers ,</l>
       <l n="72">These thick-sown snow-flakes hint of toil 's release ;</l>
       <l n="73">These feebler pulses bid me leave to others</l>
       <l n="74">The tasks once welcome ; evening asks for peace .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="20">
       <l n="75">Time claims his tribute ; silence now is golden ;</l>

       <l n="77">Though to your love untiring still beholden ,</l>
       <l n="78">The curfew tells me — cover up the fire .</l>

       <l n="81">In simplest phrase — these traitorous eyes are tearful —</l>
       <l n="82">Thanks , Brothers , Sisters ,— Children ,— and farewell !</l>

     <note>DANVERS , 1866</note>
     <p>BANKRUPT ! our pockets inside out ! Empty of words to speak his praises ! Worcester and Webster up the spout ! Dead broke of laudatory phrases ! Yet why with flowery speeches tease , With vain superlatives distress him ? Has language better words than these ? THE FRIEND OF ALL HIS RACE , GOD BLESS HIM !</p>
     <p>A simple prayer — but words more sweet By human lips were never uttered , Since Adam left the country seat Where angel wings around him fluttered . The old look on with tear-dimmed eyes , The children cluster to caress him , And every voice unbidden cries , THE FRIEND OF ALL HIS RACE , GOD BLESS HIM !</p>

     <p>AT THE SATURDAY CLUB THIS is our place of meeting ; opposite That towered and pillared building : look at it ; King 's Chapel in the Second George 's day , Rebellion stole its regal name away ,— Stone Chapel sounded better ; but at last The poisoned name of our provincial past Had lost its ancient venom ; then once more Stone Chapel was King 's Chapel as before . ( So let rechristened North Street , when it can , Bring back the days of Marlborough and Queen Anne ! ) Next the old church your wandering eye will meet — A granite pile that stares upon the street — Our civic temple ; slanderous tongues have said Its shape was modelled from St. Botolph 's head , Lofty , but narrow ; jealous passers-by Say Boston always held her head too high . Turn half-way round , and let your look survey The white facade that gleams across the way ,— The many-windowed building , tall and wide , The palace-inn that shows its northern side In grateful shadow when the sunbeams beat The granite wall in summer 's scorching heat . This is the place ; whether its name you spell Tavern , or caravansera , or hotel . Would I could steal its echoes ! you should find Such store of vanished pleasures brought to mind Such feasts ! the laughs of many a jocund hour That shook the mortar from King George 's tower ; Such guests ! What famous names its record boasts , Whose owners wander in the mob of ghosts ! Such stories ! Every beam and plank is filled With juicy wit the joyous talkers spilled , Ready to ooze , as once the mountain pine The floors are laid with oozed its turpentine !</p>

       <l n="43">The looked-for moment when a peaceful word</l>
       <l n="44">Smooths the rough ripples louder tongues have stirred .</l>

       <l n="1">THE Banker 's dinner is the stateliest feast</l>
       <l n="2">The town has heard of for a year , at least ;</l>
       <l n="3">The sparry lustres shed their broadest blaze ,</l>
       <l n="4">Damask and silver catch and spread the rays ;</l>
       <l n="5">The florist 's triumphs crown the daintier spoil</l>
       <l n="6">Won from the sea , the forest , or the soil ;</l>
       <l n="7">The steaming hot-house yields its largest pines ,</l>
       <l n="8">The sunless vaults unearth their oldest wines ;</l>
       <l n="9">With one admiring look the scene survey ,</l>
       <l n="10">And turn a moment from the bright display .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="11">Of all the joys of earthly pride or power ,</l>
       <l n="12">What gives most life , worth living , in an hour ?</l>
       <l n="13">When Victory settles on the doubtful fight</l>
       <l n="14">And the last foeman wheels in panting flight ,</l>
       <l n="15">No thrill like this is felt beneath the sun ;</l>
       <l n="16">Life 's sovereign moment is a battle won .</l>
       <l n="17">But say what next ? To shape a Senate 's choice ,</l>
       <l n="18">By the strong magic of the master 's voice ;</l>
       <l n="19">To ride the stormy tempest of debate</l>
       <l n="20">That whirls the wavering fortunes of the state .</l>
       <l n="21">Third in the list , the happy lover 's prize</l>
       <l n="22">Is won by honeyed words from women 's eyes .</l>
       <l n="23">If some would have it first instead of third ,</l>
       <l n="24">So let it be ,— I answer not a word .</l>
       <l n="25">The fourth ,— sweet readers , let the thoughtless half</l>

       <l n="27">Let the grave quarter wear its virtuous frown ,</l>
       <l n="28">The stern half-quarter try to scowl us down ;</l>
       <l n="29">But the last eighth , the choice and sifted few ,</l>
       <l n="30">Will hear my words , and , pleased , confess them true .</l>

       <l n="33">Nature , indulgent to our daily need ,</l>
       <l n="34">Kind-hearted mother ! taught us all to feed ;</l>
       <l n="35">But the chief art ,— how rarely Nature flings</l>
       <l n="36">This choicest gift among her social kings</l>
       <l n="37">Say , man of truth , has life a brighter hour</l>
       <l n="38">Than waits the chosen guest who knows his power ?</l>
       <l n="39">He moves with ease , itself an angel charm ,—</l>

       <l n="41">Slides to his seat , half leading and half led ,</l>
       <l n="42">Smiling but quiet till the grace is said ,</l>
       <l n="43">Then gently kindles , while by slow degrees</l>

       <l n="46">The neat , crisp question and the gay reply ,—</l>
       <l n="47">Talk light and airy , such as well may pass</l>
       <l n="48">Between the rested fork and lifted glass ;—</l>
       <l n="49">With play like this the earlier evening flies ,</l>
       <l n="50">Till rustling silks proclaim the ladies rise .</l>
       <l n="51">His hour has come ,— he looks along the chairs ,</l>
       <l n="52">As the Great Duke surveyed his iron squares .</l>
       <l n="53">That 's the young traveller ,— is  n't much to show ,—</l>
       <l n="54">Fast on the road , but at the table slow .</l>
       <l n="55">Next him ,— you see the author in his look ,—</l>
       <l n="56">His forehead lined with wrinkles like a book ,—</l>
       <l n="57">Wrote the great history of the ancient Huns ,—</l>
       <l n="58">Holds back to fire among the heavy guns .</l>
       <l n="59">Oh , there 's our poet seated at his side ,</l>
       <l n="60">Beloved of ladies , soft , cerulean-eyed .</l>
       <l n="61">Poets are prosy in their common talk ,</l>
       <l n="62">As the fast trotters , for the most part , walk .</l>
       <l n="63">And there 's our well-dressed gentleman , who sits ,</l>
       <l n="64">By right divine , no doubt , among the wits ,</l>
       <l n="65">Who airs his tailor 's patterns when he walks ,</l>
       <l n="66">The man that often speaks , but never talks .</l>
       <l n="67">Why should he talk , whose presence lends a grace</l>
       <l n="68">To every table where he shows his face ?</l>
       <l n="69">He knows the manual of the silver fork ,</l>
       <l n="70">Can name his claret — if he sees the cork ,—</l>
       <l n="71">Remark that “ White-top ” was considered fine ,</l>
       <l n="72">But swear the “ Juno ” is the better wine ;—</l>
       <l n="73">Is not this talking ? Ask Quintilian 's rules ;</l>
       <l n="74">If they say No , the town has many fools .</l>
       <l n="75">Pause for a moment ,— for our eyes behold</l>
       <l n="76">The plain unsceptred king , the man of gold ,</l>
       <l n="77">The thrice illustrious threefold millionnaire ;</l>
       <l n="78">Mark his slow-creeping , dead , metallic stare ;</l>
       <l n="79">His eyes , dull glimmering , like the balance-pan</l>
       <l n="80">That weighs its guinea as he weighs his man .</l>
       <l n="81">Who 's next ? An artist in a satin tie</l>
       <l n="82">Whose ample folds defeat the curious eye .</l>
       <l n="83">And there ‘ s the cousin ,— must be asked , you know ,—</l>
       <l n="84">Looks like a spinster at a baby-show .</l>
       <l n="85">Hope he is cool ,— they set him next the door ,—</l>
       <l n="86">And likes his place , between the gap and bore .</l>
       <l n="87">Next comes a Congressman , distinguished guest</l>
       <l n="88">We do n't count him ,— they asked him with the rest ;</l>
       <l n="89">And then some white cravats , with well-shaped ties ,</l>

       <l n="93">Some say they fancy , but they know not why ,</l>
       <l n="94">A shade of trouble brooding in his eye ,</l>
       <l n="95">Nothing , perhaps ,— the rooms are overhot ,—</l>
       <l n="96">Yet see his cheek ,— the dull-red burning spot ,—</l>
       <l n="97">Taste the brown sherry which he does not pass ,—</l>
       <l n="98">Ha ! That is brandy ; see him fill his glass !</l>
       <l n="99">But not forgetful of his feasting friends ,</l>
       <l n="100">To each in turn some lively word he sends ;</l>
       <l n="101">See how he throws his baited lines about ,</l>
       <l n="102">And plays his men as anglers play their trout .</l>
       <l n="103">A question drops among the listening crew</l>
       <l n="104">And hits the traveller , pat on Timbuctoo .</l>
       <l n="105">We 're on the Niger , somewhere near its source ,—</l>
       <l n="106">Not the least hurry , take the river 's course</l>
       <l n="107">Through Kissi , Foota , Kankan , Bammakoo ,</l>
       <l n="108">Bambarra , Sego , so to Timbuctoo ,</l>
       <l n="109">Thence down to Youri ;— stop him if we can ,</l>
       <l n="110">We can n't fare worse ,— wake up the Congressman !</l>
       <l n="111">The Congressman , once on his talking legs ,</l>
       <l n="112">Stirs up his knowledge to its thickest dregs ;</l>
       <l n="113">Tremendous draught for dining men to quaff !</l>
       <l n="114">Nothing will choke him but a purpling laugh .</l>
       <l n="115">A word ,— a shout ,— a mighty roar ,— ‘ t is done ;</l>
       <l n="116">Extinguished ; lassoed by a treacherous pun .</l>
       <l n="117">A laugh is priming to the loaded soul ;</l>
       <l n="118">The scattering shots become a steady roll ,</l>
       <l n="119">Broke by sharp cracks that run along the line ,</l>
       <l n="120">The light artillery of the talker 's wine .</l>
       <l n="121">The kindling goblets flame with golden dews ,</l>
       <l n="122">The hoarded flasks their tawny fire diffuse ,</l>
       <l n="123">And the Rhine 's breast-milk gushes cold and bright ,</l>
       <l n="124">Pale as the moon and maddening as her light ;</l>
       <l n="125">With crimson juice the thirsty southern sky</l>
       <l n="126">Sucks from the hills where buried armies lie ,</l>
       <l n="127">So that the dreamy passion it imparts</l>
       <l n="128">Is drawn from heroes ’ bones and lovers ’ hearts .</l>
       <l n="129">But lulls will come ; the flashing soul transmits</l>
       <l n="130">Its gleams of light in alternating fits .</l>
       <l n="131">The shower of talk that rattled down amain</l>
       <l n="132">Ends in small patterings like an April 's rain ;</l>

       <l n="218">He lived alone ,— who would  n't if he might ,</l>
       <l n="219">And leave the rogues and idiots out of sight ?</l>
       <l n="220">A foolish story ,— still , I 'll do my best ,—</l>
       <l n="221">The house was real ,— do n't believe the rest .</l>
       <l n="222">How could a ruined dwelling last so long</l>
       <l n="223">Without its legends shaped in tale and song ?</l>
       <l n="224">Who was this man of whom they tell the lies ?</l>
       <l n="225">Perhaps — why not ?— NAPOLEON ! in disguise ,—</l>
       <l n="226">So some said , kidnapped from his ocean coop ,</l>
       <l n="227">Brought to this island in a coasting sloop ,—</l>
       <l n="228">Meanwhile a sham Napoleon in his place</l>
       <l n="229">Played Nap . and saved Sir Hudson from disgrace .</l>
       <l n="230">Such was one story ; others used to say ,</l>
       <l n="231">“ No ,— not Napoleon ,— it was Marshal Ney . ”</l>
       <l n="232">“ Shot ? ” Yes , no doubt , but not with balls of lead ,</l>
       <l n="233">But balls of pith that never shoot folks dead .</l>
       <l n="234">He wandered round , lived South for many a year ,</l>
       <l n="235">At last came North and fixed his dwelling here .</l>
       <l n="236">Choose which you will of all the tales that pile</l>
       <l n="237">Their mingling fables on the tree-crowned isle .</l>
       <l n="238">Who wrote this modest version I suppose</l>
       <l n="239">That truthful Teacup , our Dictator , knows ;</l>
       <l n="240">Made up of various legends , it would seem ,</l>
       <l n="241">The sailor 's yarn , the crazy poet 's dream .</l>
       <l n="242">Such tales as this , by simple souls received ,</l>
       <l n="243">At first are stared at and at last believed ;</l>
       <l n="244">From threads like this the grave historians try</l>
       <l n="245">To weave their webs , and never know they lie .</l>
       <l n="246">Hear , then , the fables that have gathered round</l>
       <l n="247">The lonely home an exiled stranger found .</l>

       <l n="5">Have ye not marked one elm-o'ershadowed isle ,</l>
       <l n="6">Round as the dimple chased in beauty 's smile ,—</l>
       <l n="7">A stain of verdure on an azure field ,</l>
       <l n="8">Set like a jewel in a battered shield ?</l>
       <l n="9">Fixed in the narrow gorge of Ocean 's path ,</l>
       <l n="10">Peaceful it meets him in his hour of wrath ;</l>
       <l n="11">When the mailed Titan , scourged by hissing gales ,</l>
       <l n="12">Writhes in his glistening coat of clashing scales ,</l>
       <l n="13">The storm-beat island spreads its tranquil green ,</l>
       <l n="14">Calm as an emerald on an angry queen .</l>
       <l n="15">So fair when distant should be fairer near ;</l>
       <l n="16">A boat shall waft us from the outstretched pier .</l>
       <l n="17">The breeze blows fresh ; we reach the island 's edge ,</l>
       <l n="18">Our shallop rustling through the yielding sedge .</l>
       <l n="19">No welcome greets us on the desert isle ;</l>
       <l n="20">Those elms , far-shadowing , hide no stately pile</l>

       <l n="22">And to ! the traces of a fair abode ;</l>

       <l n="90">There came a flash as from the milky corn ,</l>

       <l n="6">Along the Pincian Hill or Appian Way ;</l>
       <l n="7">They rubbed his wasted limbs with sulphurous oil ,</l>
       <l n="8">Oozed from the far-off Orient 's heated soil ;</l>

     <p>These verses have always been printed in my collected poems , and as the best of them may bear a single reading , I allow them to appear , but in a less conspicuous position than the other productions . A chick , before his shell is off his back , is hardly a fair subject for severe criticism . If one has written anything worth preserving , his first efforts may be objects of interest and curiosity . Other young authors may take encouragement from seeing how tame , how feeble , how commonplace were the rudimentary attempts of the half-fledged poet . If the boy or youth had anything in him , there will probably be some sign of it in the midst of his imitative mediocrities and ambitious failures . These “ first verses ” of mine , written before I was sixteen , have little beyond a common academy boy 's ordinary performance . Yet a kindly critic said there was one line which showed a poetical quality :—</p>
     <p>“ The boiling ocean trembled into calm . ”</p>
     <p>One of these poems — the reader may guess which — won fair words from Thackeray . The Spectre Pig was a wicked suggestion which came into my head after reading Dana 's Buccaneer . Nobody seemed to find it out , and I never mentioned it to the venerable poet , who might not have been pleased with the parody . This is enough to say of these unvalued copies of verses .</p>
