     <l n="5">Beats time but to the tread of marching deeds ,</l>
     <l n="6">Following the mighty van that Freedom leads ,</l>
     <l n="7">Her glorious standard flaming to the day !</l>
     <l n="8">The crimsoned pavement where a hero bleeds</l>
     <l n="9">Breathes nobler lessons than the poet 's lay .</l>
     <l n="10">Strong arms , broad breasts , brave hearts , are better worth</l>

     <l n="20">It matters little if they pall or please ,</l>
     <l n="21">Dropping untimely , while the sudden gleams</l>
     <l n="22">Glare from the mustering clouds whose blackness seems</l>
     <l n="23">Too swollen to hold its lightning from the trees .</l>

   <p>AGNES</p>
   <p>The story of Sir Harry Frankland and Agnes Surriage is told in the ballad with a very strict adhesion to the facts . These were obtained from information afforded me by the Rev . Mr. Webster , of Hopkinton , in company with whom I visited the Frankland Mansion in that town , then standing ; from a very interesting Memoir , by the Rev . Elias Nason , of Medford ; and from the manuscript diary of Sir Harry , or more properly Sir Charles Henry Frankland , now in the library of the Massachusetts Historical Society .</p>
   <p>At the time of the visit referred to , old Julia was living , and on our return we called at the house where she resided .— [ She was living June 10 , 1861 , when this ballad was published ] — Her account is little more than paraphrased in the poem . If the incidents are treated with a certain liberality at the close of the fifth part , the essential fact that Agnes rescued Sir Harry from the ruins after the earthquake , and their subsequent marriage as related , may be accepted as literal truth . So with regard to most of the trifling details which are given ; they are taken from the record . It is greatly to be regretted that the Frankland Mansion no longer exists . It was accidentally burned on the 23d of January , 1858 , a year or two after the first sketch of this ballad was written . A visit to it was like stepping out of the century into the years before the Revolution . A new house , similar in plan and arrangements to the old one , has been built upon its site , and the terraces , the clump of box , and the lilacs doubtless remain to bear witness to the truth of this story .</p>
   <p>The story , which I have told literally in rhyme , has been made the subject of a carefully studied and interesting romance by Mr. E. L. Bynner .</p>

     <l n="71">So streamed the vision through his sunken eye ,</l>
     <l n="72">Clad in the splendors of his morning sky .</l>
     <l n="73">All the wild hopes his eager boyhood knew ,</l>
     <l n="74">All the young fancies riper years proved true ,</l>
     <l n="75">The sweet , low-whispered words , the winning glance</l>
     <l n="76">From queens of song , from Houris of the dance ,</l>
     <l n="77">Wealth 's lavish gift , and Flattery 's soothing phrase ,</l>
     <l n="78">And Beauty 's silence when her blush was praise ,</l>
     <l n="79">And melting Pride , her lashes wet with tears ,</l>
     <l n="80">Triumphs and banquets , wreaths and crowns and cheers ,</l>
     <l n="81">Pangs of wild joy that perish on the tongue ,</l>
     <l n="82">And all that poets dream , but leave unsung !</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="83">In every heart some viewless founts are fed</l>
     <l n="84">From far-off hillsides where the dews were shed ;</l>
     <l n="85">On the worn features of the weariest face</l>
     <l n="86">Some youthful memory leaves its hidden trace ,</l>
     <l n="87">As in old gardens left by exiled kings</l>
     <l n="88">The marble basins tell of hidden springs ,</l>
     <l n="89">But , gray with dust , and overgrown with weeds ,</l>
     <l n="90">Their choking jets the passer little heeds ,</l>
     <l n="91">Till time 's revenges break their seals away ,</l>
     <l n="92">And , clad in rainbow light , the waters play .</l>

     <l n="93">Good night , fond dreamer ! let the curtain fall</l>
     <l n="94">The world 's a stage , and we are players all .</l>
     <l n="95">A strange rehearsal ! Kings without their crowns ,</l>
     <l n="96">And threadbare lords , and jewel-wearing clowns ,</l>
     <l n="97">Speak the vain words that mock their throbbing hearts ,</l>
     <l n="98">As Want , stern prompter ! spells them out their parts .</l>
     <l n="99">The tinselled hero whom we praise and pay</l>
     <l n="100">Is twice an actor in a twofold play .</l>
     <l n="101">We smile at children when a painted screen</l>
     <l n="102">Seems to their simple eyes a real scene ;</l>
     <l n="103">Ask the poor hireling , who has left his throne</l>
     <l n="104">To seek the cheerless home he calls his own ,</l>
     <l n="105">Which of his double lives most real seems ,</l>
     <l n="106">The world of solid fact or scenic dreams ?</l>
     <l n="107">Canvas , or clouds ,— the footlights , or the spheres ,—</l>
     <l n="108">The play of two short hours , or seventy years ?</l>
     <l n="109">Dream on ! Though Heaven may woo our open eyes ,</l>
     <l n="110">Through their closed lids we look on fairer skies ;</l>
     <l n="111">Truth is for other worlds , and hope for this ;</l>
     <l n="112">The cheating future lends the present 's bliss ;</l>
     <l n="113">Life is a running shade , with fettered hands ,</l>
     <l n="114">That chases phantoms over shifting sands ;</l>
     <l n="115">Death a still spectre on a marble seat ,</l>
     <l n="116">With ever clutching palms and shackled feet ;</l>
     <l n="117">The airy shapes that mock life 's slender chain ,</l>
     <l n="118">The flying joys he strives to clasp in vain ,</l>
     <l n="119">Death only grasps ; to live is to pursue ,—</l>
     <l n="120">Dream on ! there ‘ s nothing but illusion true !</l>

     <l n="3">ANGEL of Death ! extend thy silent reign !</l>
     <l n="4">Stretch thy dark sceptre o'er this new domain</l>
     <l n="5">No sable car along the winding road</l>
     <l n="6">Has borne to earth its unresisting load ;</l>
     <l n="7">No sudden mound has risen yet to show</l>
     <l n="8">Where the pale slumberer folds his arms below ;</l>
     <l n="9">No marble gleams to bid his memory live</l>
     <l n="10">In the brief lines that hurrying Time can give ;</l>
     <l n="11">Yet , O Destroyer ! from thy shrouded throne</l>
     <l n="12">Look on our gift ; this realm is all thine own !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="13">Fair is the scene ; its sweetness oft beguiled</l>
     <l n="14">From their dim paths the children of the wild ;</l>
     <l n="15">The dark-haired maiden loved its grassy dells ,</l>
     <l n="16">The feathered warrior claimed its wooded swells ,</l>
     <l n="17">Still on its slopes the ploughman 's ridges show</l>
     <l n="18">The pointed flints that left his fatal bow ,</l>
     <l n="19">Chipped with rough art and slow barbarian toil ,—</l>
     <l n="20">Last of his wrecks that strews the alien soil !</l>
     <l n="21">Here spread the fields that heaped their ripened store</l>
     <l n="22">Till the brown arms of Labor held no more ;</l>
     <l n="23">The scythe 's broad meadow with its dusky blush ;</l>
     <l n="24">The sickle 's harvest with its velvet flush ;</l>
     <l n="25">The green-haired maize , her silken tresses laid ,</l>
     <l n="26">In soft luxuriance , on her harsh brocade ;</l>
     <l n="27">The gourd that swells beneath her tossing plume ;</l>
     <l n="28">The coarser wheat that rolls in lakes of bloom ,—</l>
     <l n="29">Its coral stems and milk-white flowers alive</l>
     <l n="30">With the wide murmurs of the scattered hive ;</l>
     <l n="31">Here glowed the apple with the pencilled streak</l>
     <l n="32">Of morning painted on its southern cheek ;</l>
     <l n="33">The pear 's long necklace strung with golden drops ,</l>
     <l n="34">Arched , like the banian , o'er its pillared props ;</l>
     <l n="35">Here crept the growths that paid the laborer 's care</l>
     <l n="36">With the cheap luxuries wealth consents to spare ;</l>
     <l n="37">Here sprang the healing herbs which could not save</l>
     <l n="38">The hand that reared them from the neighboring grave .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="39">Yet all its varied charms , forever free</l>
     <l n="40">From task and tribute , Labor yields to thee</l>
     <l n="41">No more , when April sheds her fitful rain ,</l>
     <l n="42">The sower 's hand shall cast its flying grain ;</l>
     <l n="43">No more , when Autumn strews the flaming leaves ,</l>
     <l n="44">The reaper 's band shall gird its yellow sheaves ;</l>
     <l n="45">For thee alike the circling seasons flow</l>
     <l n="46">Till the first blossoms heave the latest snow .</l>
     <l n="47">In the stiff clod below the whirling drifts ,</l>
     <l n="48">In the loose soil the springing herbage lifts ,</l>
     <l n="49">In the hot dust beneath the parching weeds ,</l>
     <l n="50">Life 's withering flower shall drop its shrivelled seeds ;</l>
     <l n="51">Its germ entranced in thy unbreathing sleep</l>

     <l n="56">Through the red lips of June 's half-open rose ,</l>
     <l n="57">Dressed in bright hues , the loving sunshine 's dower ;</l>
     <l n="58">For tranquil Nature owns no mourning flower .</l>
     <l n="59">Come from the forest where the beech 's screen</l>
     <l n="60">Bars the fierce moonbeam with its flakes of green ;</l>
     <l n="61">Stay the rude axe that bares the shadowy plains ,</l>
     <l n="62">Stanch the deep wound That dries the maple 's veins .</l>
     <l n="63">Come with the stream whose silver-braided rills</l>
     <l n="64">Fling their unclasping bracelets from the hills ,</l>
     <l n="65">Till in one gleam , beneath the forest 's wings ,</l>
     <l n="66">Melts the white glitter of a hundred springs .</l>

     <l n="69">On the huge shapes , that , crouching at their knees ,</l>
     <l n="70">Stretch their broad shoulders , rough with shaggy trees .</l>
     <l n="71">Through the wide waste of ether , not in vain ,</l>
     <l n="72">Their softened gaze shall reach our distant plain ;</l>
     <l n="73">There , while the mourner turns his aching eyes</l>
     <l n="74">On the blue mounds that print the bluer skies ,</l>
     <l n="75">Nature shall whisper that the fading view</l>
     <l n="76">Of mightiest grief may wear a heavenly hue .</l>
     <l n="77">Cherub of Wisdom ! let thy marble page</l>
     <l n="78">Leave its sad lesson , new to every age ;</l>
     <l n="79">Teach us to live , not grudging every breath</l>
     <l n="80">To the chill winds that waft us on to death ,</l>
     <l n="81">But ruling calmly every pulse it warms ,</l>
     <l n="82">And tempering gently every word it forms .</l>
     <l n="83">Seraph of Love ! in heaven 's adoring zone ,</l>
     <l n="84">Nearest of all around the central throne ,</l>
     <l n="85">While with soft hands the pillowed turf we spread</l>
     <l n="86">That soon shall hold us in its dreamless bed ,</l>
     <l n="87">With the low whisper ,— Who shall first be laid</l>
     <l n="88">In the dark chamber 's yet unbroken shade ?—</l>
     <l n="89">Let thy sweet radiance shine rekindled here ,</l>
     <l n="90">And all we cherish grow more truly dear .</l>

     <l n="92">Oh , teach us kindness for our brother 's fault</l>

     <l n="1">DEAR GOVERNOR , if my skiff might brave</l>
     <l n="2">The winds that lift the ocean wave ,</l>
     <l n="3">The mountain stream that loops and swerves</l>
     <l n="4">Through my broad meadow 's channelled curves</l>

     <l n="9">It may not be ; too long the track</l>

     <l n="11">The sun has set on fair Naushon</l>
     <l n="12">Long ere my western blaze is gone ;</l>

     <l n="14">In shadows round your swinging bark ,</l>
     <l n="15">While yet the yellow sunset fills</l>
     <l n="16">The stream that scarfs my spruce-clad hills ;</l>
     <l n="17">The day-star wakes your island deer</l>
     <l n="18">Long ere my barnyard chanticleer ;</l>
     <l n="19">Your mists are soaring in the blue</l>

     <l n="24">What goodly feats of peaceful strife ,—</l>
     <l n="25">Such jests , that , drained of every joke ,</l>
     <l n="26">The very bank of language broke ,—</l>
     <l n="27">Such deeds , that Laughter nearly died</l>
     <l n="28">With stitches in his belted side ;</l>
     <l n="29">While Time , caught fast in pleasure 's chain ,</l>
     <l n="30">His double goblet snapped in twain ,</l>
     <l n="31">And stood with half in either hand ,—</l>
     <l n="32">Both brimming full ,— but not of sand !</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>It may not be ; I strive in vain To break my slender household chain ,— Three pairs of little clasping hands , One voice , that whispers , not commands . Even while my spirit flies away , My gentle jailers murmur nay ; All shapes of elemental wrath They raise along my threatened path ; The storm grows black , the waters rise , The mountains mingle with the skies , The mad tornado scoops the ground , The midnight robber prowls around ,— Thus , kissing every limb they tie , They draw a knot and heave a sigh , Till , fairly netted in the toil , My feet are rooted to the soil . Only the soaring wish is free !— And that , dear Governor , flies to thee ! PITTSFIELD , 1851 .</p>

   <p>[ THE STEAMBOAT . ] Mr. Emerson has quoted some lines from this poem , but somewhat disguised as he recalled them . It is never safe to quote poetry without referring to the original .</p>
   <p>[ Hark ! The sweet bells renew their welcome sound . ] The churches referred to in the lines which follow are ,— 1 . King 's Chapel , the foundation of which was laid by Governor Shirley in 1749 . 2 . Brattle Street Church , consecrated in 1773 . The completion of this edifice , the design of which included a spire , was prevented by the troubles of the Revolution , and its plain , square tower presented nothing more attractive than a massive simplicity . In the front of this tower , till the church was demolished in 1872 , there was to be seen , half imbedded in the brick-work , a cannon-ball , which was thrown from the American fortifications at Cambridge , during the bombard-ment of the city , then occupied by the British troops . 3 . The Old South , first occupied for public worship in 1730 . 4 . Park Street Church , built in 1809 , the tall white steeple of which is the most conspicuous of all the Boston spires . 5 . Christ Church , opened for public worship in 1723 , and containing a set of eight bells , long the only chime in Boston .</p>
   <p>[ INTERNATIONAL ODE . ] This ode was sung in unison by twelve hundred children of the public schools , to the air of “ God save the Queen , ” at the visit of the Prince of Wales to Boston , October 18 , 1860 .</p>
