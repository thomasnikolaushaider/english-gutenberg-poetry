    <docTitle><titlePart>‘ Ban and Arriere Ban ! ’ a host Broken , beaten , all unled , They return as doth a ghost From the dead . Sad or glad my rallied rhymes , Sought our dusty papers through , For the sake of other times Come to you . Times and places new we know , Faces fresh and seasons strange But the friends of long ago Do not change . ERRATUM : Reader , a blot hath escaped the watchfulness of the setter forth : if thou wilt thou mayst amend it . The sonnet on the forty-fourth page , against all right Italianate laws , hath but thirteen lines withal : add another to thy liking , if thou art a Maker ; or , if thou art none , even be content with what is set before thee . If it be scant measure , be sure it is choicely good .</titlePart></docTitle>

      <head>HOW THEY HELD THE BASS FOR KING JAMES — 1691-1693</head>

      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="2">Ye hae heard Whigs crack o ’ the Saints in the Bass , my faith , a</l>
       <l n="3">gruesome tale ;</l>
       <l n="4">How the Remnant paid at a tippeny rate , for a quart o ’ ha'penny</l>
       <l n="5">ale !</l>
       <l n="6">But I 'll tell ye anither tale o ’ the Bass , that 'll hearten ye up to</l>
       <l n="7">hear ,</l>
       <l n="8">Sae I pledge ye to Middleton first in a glass , and a health to the</l>
       <l n="9">Young Chevalier !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="10">The Bass stands frae North Berwick Law a league or less to sea ,</l>
       <l n="11">About its feet the breakers beat , abune the sea-maws flee ,</l>
       <l n="12">There 's castle stark and dungeon dark , wherein the godly lay ,</l>
       <l n="13">That made their rant for the Covenant through mony a weary day .</l>
       <l n="14">For twal ’ years lang the caverns rang wi ’ preaching , prayer , and</l>
       <l n="15">psalm ,</l>
       <l n="16">Ye 'd think the winds were soughing wild , when a ’ the winds were</l>
       <l n="17">calm ,</l>
       <l n="18">There wad they preach , each Saint to each , and glower as the</l>
       <l n="19">soldiers pass ,</l>
       <l n="20">And Peden wared his malison on a bonny leaguer lass ,</l>
       <l n="21">As she stood and daffed , while the warders laughed , and wha sae</l>
       <l n="22">blithe as she ,</l>
       <l n="23">But a wind o ’ ill worked his warlock will , and flang her out to</l>
       <l n="24">sea .</l>
       <l n="25">Then wha sae bright as the Saints that night , and an angel came ,</l>
       <l n="26">say they ,</l>
       <l n="27">And sang in the cell where the Righteous dwell , but he took na a</l>
       <l n="28">Saint away .</l>
       <l n="29">There yet might they be , for nane could flee , and nane daur 'd break</l>
       <l n="30">the jail ,</l>
       <l n="31">And still the sobbing o ’ the sea might mix wi ’ their warlock wail ,</l>
       <l n="32">But then came in black echty-echt , and bluidy echty-nine ,</l>
       <l n="33">Wi ’ Cess , and Press , and Presbytery , and a ’ the dule sin ’ syne ,</l>
       <l n="34">The Saints won free wi ’ the power o ’ the key , and cavaliers maun</l>
       <l n="35">pine !</l>
       <l n="36">It was Halyburton , Middleton , and Roy and young Dunbar ,</l>
       <l n="37">That Livingstone took on Cromdale haughs , in the last fight of the</l>
       <l n="38">war :</l>
       <l n="39">And they were warded in the Bass , till the time they should be</l>
       <l n="40">slain ,</l>
       <l n="41">Where bluidy Mitchell , and Blackader , and Earlston lang had lain ;</l>
       <l n="42">Four lads alone , ‘ gainst a garrison , but Glory crowns their names ,</l>
       <l n="43">For they brought it to pass that they took the Bass , and they held</l>
       <l n="44">it for King James !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="45">It isna by preaching half the night , ye 'll burst a dungeon door ,</l>
       <l n="46">It wasna by dint o ’ psalmody they broke the hold , they four ,</l>
       <l n="47">For lang years three that rock in the sea bade Wullie Wanbeard gae</l>
       <l n="48">swing ,</l>
       <l n="49">And England and Scotland fause may be , but the Bass Rock stands for</l>
       <l n="50">the King !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="51">There 's but ae pass gangs up the Bass , it 's guarded wi ’ strong</l>
       <l n="52">gates four ,</l>
       <l n="53">And still as the soldiers went to the sea , they steikit them , door</l>
       <l n="54">by door ,</l>
       <l n="55">And this did they do when they helped a crew that brought their</l>
       <l n="56">coals on shore .</l>
       <l n="57">Thither all had gone , save three men alone : then Middleton gripped</l>
       <l n="58">his man ,</l>
       <l n="59">Halyburton felled the sergeant lad , Dunbar seized the gunner , Swan ;</l>
       <l n="60">Roy bound their hands , in hempen bands , and the Cavaliers were</l>
       <l n="61">free .</l>
       <l n="62">And they trained the guns on the soldier loons that were down wi ’</l>
       <l n="63">the boat by the sea !</l>
       <l n="64">Then Middleton cried frae the high cliff-side , and his voice garr 'd</l>
       <l n="65">the auld rocks ring ,</l>
       <l n="66">‘ Will ye stand or flee by the land or sea , for I hold the Bass for</l>
       <l n="67">the King ? ’</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="68">They had nae desire to face the fire ; it was mair than men might</l>
       <l n="69">do ,</l>
       <l n="70">So they e'en sailed back in the auld coal-smack , a sorry and shame-</l>
       <l n="71">faced crew ,</l>
       <l n="72">And they hirpled doun to Edinburgh toun , wi ’ the story of their</l>
       <l n="73">shames ,</l>
       <l n="74">How the prisoners bold had broken hold , and kept the Bass for King</l>
       <l n="75">James .</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>King James he has sent them guns and men , and the Whigs they guard the Bass , But they never could catch the Cavaliers , who took toll of ships that pass , They fared wild and free as the birds o ’ the sea , and at night they went on the wing , And they lifted the kye o ’ Whigs far and nigh , and they revelled and drank to the King .</p>
     <lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">Then Wullie Wanbeard sends his ships to siege the Bass in form ,</l>
       <l n="2">And first shall they break the fortress down , and syne the Rock</l>
       <l n="3">they 'll storm .</l>
       <l n="4">After twa days ’ fight they fled in the night , and glad eneuch to</l>
       <l n="5">go ,</l>
       <l n="6">With their rigging rent , and their powder spent , and many a man</l>
       <l n="7">laid low .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="8">So for lang years three did they sweep the sea , but a closer watch</l>
       <l n="9">was set ,</l>
       <l n="10">Till nae food had they , but twa ounce a day o ’ meal was the maist</l>
       <l n="11">they 'd get .</l>
       <l n="12">And men fight but tame on an empty wame , so they sent a flag o ’</l>
       <l n="13">truce ,</l>
       <l n="14">And blithe were the Privy Council then , when the Whigs had heard</l>
       <l n="15">that news .</l>
       <l n="16">Twa Lords they sent wi ’ a strang intent to be dour on each</l>
       <l n="17">Cavalier ,</l>
       <l n="18">But wi ’ French cakes fine , and his last drap o ’ wine , did Middleton</l>
       <l n="19">make them cheer ,</l>
       <l n="20">On the muzzles o ’ guns he put coats and caps , and he set them aboot</l>
       <l n="21">the wa 's ,</l>
       <l n="22">And the Whigs thocht then he had food and men to stand for the</l>
       <l n="23">Rightfu ’ Cause .</l>
       <l n="24">So he got a ’ he craved , and his men were saved , and nane might say</l>
       <l n="25">them nay ,</l>
       <l n="26">Wi ’ sword by side , and flag o ’ pride , free men might they gang</l>
       <l n="27">their way ,</l>
       <l n="28">They might fare to France , they might bide at hame , and the better</l>
       <l n="29">their grace to buy ,</l>
       <l n="30">Wullie Wanbeard 's purse maun pay the keep o ’ the men that did him</l>
       <l n="31">defy !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="32">Men never hae gotten sic terms o ’ peace since first men went to</l>
       <l n="33">war ,</l>
       <l n="34">As got Halyburton , and Middleton , and Roy , and the young Dunbar .</l>

       <l n="5">Or dozed upon the bartizan .</l>

       <l n="8">He listened to the birds that sung</l>
       <l n="9">Go forth and win the haunted tower !</l>
       <l n="10">The tangled brake made way for him ,</l>

       <l n="52">And goodly Porthos , as of old the famed Orthryades ,</l>
       <l n="53">Raises the trophy of the fight , then falling on his knees ,</l>
       <l n="54">He writes in gore upon his shield , ‘ Romance , Romance , has won ! ’</l>
       <l n="55">And blood-red on that stricken field goes down the angry sun .</l>
       <l n="56">Night falls upon the field of death , night on the darkling lea :</l>

    <p n="1">A SCOT TO JEANNE D'ARC</p>
    <p n="2">Jeanne d'Arc is said to have led a Scottish force at Lagny , when she defeated the Burgundian , Franquet d'Arras . A Scottish artist painted her banner ; he was a James Polwarth , or a Hume of Polwarth , according to a conjecture of Mr. Hill Burton 's . A monk of Dunfermline , who continued Fordun 's Chronicle , avers that he was with the Maiden in her campaigns , and at her martyrdom . He calls her Puella a spiritu sancto excitata . Unluckily his manuscript breaks off in the middle of a sentence . At her trial , Jeanne said that she had only once seen her own portrait : it was in the hands of a Scottish archer . The story of the white dove which passed from her lips as they opened to her last cry of Jesus ! was reported at the trial for her Rehabilitation ( 1450-56 ) .</p>
    <p n="3">ONE OF THAT NAME .</p>
    <p n="4">Two archers of the name of Lang , Lain , or Laing were in the French service about 1507 . See the book on the Scottish Guard , by Father Forbes Leith , S. J .</p>
    <p n="5">THY CHURCH UNTO THE MAID DENIES .</p>
    <p n="6">These verses were written , curiously enough , the day before the Maiden was raised to the rank of ‘ Venerable , ’ a step towards her canonisation , which , we trust , will not be long delayed . It is not easy for any one to understand the whole miracle of the life and death of Jeanne d'Arc , and the absolutely unparalleled grandeur and charm of her character , without studying the full records of both her trials , as collected and published by M. Quicherat , for the Societe de l'Histoire de France .</p>
    <p n="7">HOW THEY HELD THE BASS .</p>
    <p n="8">This story is versified from the account in Memoirs of the Rev . John Blackader , by Andrew Crichton , Minister of the Gospel . Second Edition . Edinburgh , 1826 . Dunbar was retained as a prisoner , when negotiations for surrender , in 1691 , were broken off by Middleton 's return with supplies . Halyburton was , it seems , captured later , and only escaped hanging by virtue of the terms extorted by Middleton . Patrick Walker tells the tale of Peden and the girl . Wodrow , in his Analecta , has the story of the Angel , or other shining spiritual presence , which is removed from its context in the ballad . The sufferings from weak beer are quoted in Mr. Blackader 's Memoirs . Mitchell was the undeniably brave Covenanter who shot at Sharp , and hit the Bishop of the Orkneys . He was tortured , and , by an act of perjury ( probably unconscious ) on the part of Lauderdale , was hanged . The sentiments of the poem are such as an old cavalier , surviving to 1743 , might perhaps have entertained . ‘ Wullie Wanbeard ’ is a Jacobite name for the Prince of Orange , perhaps invented only by the post-Jacobite sentiment of the early nineteenth century .</p>
    <p n="9">BRITANNIA</p>
    <p n="10">ROUSSEAU 'S DELIGHT .</p>
    <p n="11">The pervenche , or periwinkle .</p>
    <p n="12">A TOAST</p>
    <p n="13">One of the college bells Of St. Salvator , mentioned by Ferguson , is called ‘ Kate Kennedy ’ ; the heroine is unknown , but Bishop Kennedy founded the College . ‘ Kate Kennedy 's Day ’ was a kind of carnival , probably a survival from that festivity .</p>
    <p n="14">THE DISAPPOINTMENT .</p>
    <p n="15">As a matter of fact the Haunted House Committee of the Society for Psychical Research have never succeeded in seeing a ghost .</p>
