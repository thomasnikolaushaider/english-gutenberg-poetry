  <body>
   <note>The following poems , with one exception , were written at sea , in the latter part of October . I had not then heard of Dr. Channing 's death . Since that event , the poem addressed to him is no longer appropriate . I have decided , however , to let it remain as it was written , a feeble testimony of my admiration for a great and good man .</note>

     <l n="1">The noble horse ,</l>
     <l n="2">That , in his fiery youth , from his wide nostrils</l>
     <l n="3">Neighed courage to his rider , and brake through</l>
     <l n="4">Groves of opposed pikes , bearing his lord</l>
     <l n="5">Safe to triumphant victory , old or wounded ,</l>
     <l n="6">Was set at liberty and freed from service .</l>
     <l n="7">The Athenian mules , that from the quarry drew</l>
     <l n="8">Marble , hewed for the Temple of the Gods ,</l>
     <l n="9">The great work ended , were dismissed and fed</l>
     <l n="10">At the public cost ; nay , faithful dogs have found</l>
     <l n="11">Their sepulchres ; but man , to man more cruel ,</l>
     <l n="12">Appoints no end to the sufferings of his slave .</l>

     <l n="1">The pages of thy book I read ,</l>
     <l n="2">And as I closed each one ,</l>
     <l n="3">My heart , responding , ever said ,</l>
     <l n="4">“ Servant of God ! well done ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">Well done ! Thy words are great and bold ;</l>
     <l n="6">At times they seem to me ,</l>
     <l n="7">Like Luther 's , in the days of old ,</l>
     <l n="8">Half-battles for the free .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">Go on , until this land revokes</l>
     <l n="10">The old and chartered Lie ,</l>
     <l n="11">The feudal curse , whose whips and yokes</l>
     <l n="12">Insult humanity .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">A voice is ever at thy side</l>
     <l n="14">Speaking in tones of might ,</l>
     <l n="15">Like the prophetic voice , that cried</l>
     <l n="16">To John in Patmos , “ Write ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="17">Write ! and tell out this bloody tale ;</l>
     <l n="18">Record this dire eclipse ,</l>
     <l n="19">This Day of Wrath , this Endless Wail ,</l>

    <head>THE SLAVE 'S DREAM .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Beside the ungathered rice he lay ,</l>
     <l n="2">His sickle in his hand ;</l>
     <l n="3">His breast was bare , his matted hair</l>
     <l n="4">Was buried in the sand .</l>
     <l n="5">Again , in the mist and shadow of sleep ,</l>
     <l n="6">He saw his Native Land .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="7">Wide through the landscape of his dreams</l>
     <l n="8">The lordly Niger flowed ;</l>
     <l n="9">Beneath the palm-trees on the plain</l>
     <l n="10">Once more a king he strode ;</l>
     <l n="11">And heard the tinkling caravans</l>
     <l n="12">Descend the mountain-road .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="13">He saw once more his dark-eyed queen</l>
     <l n="14">Among her children stand ;</l>
     <l n="15">They clasped his neck , they kissed his cheeks ,</l>
     <l n="16">They held him by the hand !—</l>
     <l n="17">A tear burst from the sleeper 's lids</l>
     <l n="18">And fell into the sand .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="19">And then at furious speed he rode</l>
     <l n="20">Along the Niger 's bank ;</l>
     <l n="21">His bridle-reins were golden chains ,</l>
     <l n="22">And , with a martial clank ,</l>
     <l n="23">At each leap he could feel his scabbard of steel</l>
     <l n="24">Smiting his stallion 's flank .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="25">Before him , like a blood-red flag ,</l>
     <l n="26">The bright flamingoes flew ;</l>
     <l n="27">From morn till night he followed their flight ,</l>
     <l n="28">O'er plains where the tamarind grew ,</l>
     <l n="29">Till he saw the roofs of Caffre huts ,</l>
     <l n="30">And the ocean rose to view .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="31">At night he heard the lion roar ,</l>
     <l n="32">And the hyaena scream ,</l>
     <l n="33">And the river-horse , as he crushed the reeds</l>
     <l n="34">Beside some hidden stream ;</l>
     <l n="35">And it passed , like a glorious roll of drums ,</l>
     <l n="36">Through the triumph of his dream .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="37">The forests , with their myriad tongues ,</l>
     <l n="38">Shouted of liberty ;</l>
     <l n="39">And the Blast of the Desert cried aloud ,</l>
     <l n="40">With a voice so wild and free ,</l>
     <l n="41">That he started in his sleep and smiled</l>
     <l n="42">At their tempestuous glee .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="43">He did not feel the driver 's whip ,</l>
     <l n="44">Nor the burning heat of day ;</l>
     <l n="45">For Death had illumined the Land of Sleep ,</l>
     <l n="46">And his lifeless body lay</l>
     <l n="47">A worn-out fetter , that the soul</l>
     <l n="48">Had broken and thrown away !</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>THE GOOD PART ,</head>
    <head>THAT SHALL NOT BE TAKEN AWAY .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">She dwells by Great Kenhawa 's side ,</l>
     <l n="2">In valleys green and cool ;</l>
     <l n="3">And all her hope and all her pride</l>
     <l n="4">Are in the village school .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">Her soul , like the transparent air</l>
     <l n="6">That robes the hills above ,</l>
     <l n="7">Though not of earth , encircles there</l>
     <l n="8">All things with arms of love .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">And thus she walks among her girls</l>
     <l n="10">With praise and mild rebukes ;</l>
     <l n="11">Subduing e'en rude village churls</l>
     <l n="12">By her angelic looks .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">She reads to them at eventide</l>
     <l n="14">Of One who came to save ;</l>
     <l n="15">To cast the captive 's chains aside ,</l>
     <l n="16">And liberate the slave .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="17">And oft the blessed time foretells</l>
     <l n="18">When all men shall be free ;</l>
     <l n="19">And musical , as silver bells ,</l>
     <l n="20">Their falling chains shall be .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="21">And following her beloved Lord ,</l>
     <l n="22">In decent poverty ,</l>
     <l n="23">She makes her life one sweet record</l>
     <l n="24">And deed of charity .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="25">For she was rich , and gave up all</l>
     <l n="26">To break the iron bands</l>
     <l n="27">Of those who waited in her hall ,</l>
     <l n="28">And labored in her lands .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="29">Long since beyond the Southern Sea</l>
     <l n="30">Their outbound sails have sped ,</l>
     <l n="31">While she , in meek humility ,</l>
     <l n="32">Now earns her daily bread .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="33">It is their prayers , which never cease ,</l>
     <l n="34">That clothe her with such grace ;</l>
     <l n="35">Their blessing is the light of peace</l>
     <l n="36">That shines upon her face .</l>

    <head>THE SLAVE IN THE DISMAL SWAMP .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">In dark fens of the Dismal Swamp</l>
     <l n="2">The hunted Negro lay ;</l>
     <l n="3">He saw the fire of the midnight camp ,</l>
     <l n="4">And heard at times a horse 's tramp</l>
     <l n="5">And a bloodhound 's distant bay .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="6">Where will-o ’ - the-wisps and glowworms shine ,</l>
     <l n="7">In bulrush and in brake ;</l>
     <l n="8">Where waving mosses shroud the pine ,</l>
     <l n="9">And the cedar grows , and the poisonous vine</l>
     <l n="10">Is spotted like the snake ;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="11">Where hardly a human foot could pass ,</l>
     <l n="12">Or a human heart would dare ,</l>
     <l n="13">On the quaking turf of the green morass</l>
     <l n="14">He crouched in the rank and tangled grass ,</l>
     <l n="15">Like a wild beast in his lair .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="16">A poor old slave , infirm and lame ;</l>
     <l n="17">Great scars deformed his face ;</l>
     <l n="18">On his forehead he bore the brand of shame ,</l>
     <l n="19">And the rags , that hid his mangled frame ,</l>
     <l n="20">Were the livery of disgrace .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="21">All things above were bright and fair ,</l>
     <l n="22">All things were glad and free ;</l>
     <l n="23">Lithe squirrels darted here and there ,</l>
     <l n="24">And wild birds filled the echoing air</l>
     <l n="25">With songs of Liberty !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="26">On him alone was the doom of pain ,</l>
     <l n="27">From the morning of his birth ;</l>
     <l n="28">On him alone the curse of Cain</l>
     <l n="29">Fell , like a flail on the garnered grain ,</l>
     <l n="30">And struck him to the earth !</l>

    <head>THE SLAVE SINGING AT MIDNIGHT .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Loud he sang the psalm of David !</l>
     <l n="2">He , a Negro and enslaved ,</l>
     <l n="3">Sang of Israel 's victory ,</l>
     <l n="4">Sang of Zion , bright and free .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">In that hour , when night is calmest ,</l>
     <l n="6">Sang he from the Hebrew Psalmist ,</l>
     <l n="7">In a voice so sweet and clear</l>
     <l n="8">That I could not choose but hear ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">Songs of triumph , and ascriptions ,</l>
     <l n="10">Such as reached the swart Egyptians ,</l>
     <l n="11">When upon the Red Sea coast</l>
     <l n="12">Perished Pharaoh and his host .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">And the voice of his devotion</l>
     <l n="14">Filled my soul with strange emotion ;</l>
     <l n="15">For its tones by turns were glad ,</l>
     <l n="16">Sweetly solemn , wildly sad .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="17">Paul and Silas , in their prison ,</l>
     <l n="18">Sang of Christ , the Lord arisen ,</l>
     <l n="19">And an earthquake 's arm of might</l>
     <l n="20">Broke their dungeon-gates at night .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="21">But , alas ! what holy angel</l>
     <l n="22">Brings the Slave this glad evangel ?</l>
     <l n="23">And what earthquake 's arm of might</l>
     <l n="24">Breaks his dungeon-gates at night ?</l>
