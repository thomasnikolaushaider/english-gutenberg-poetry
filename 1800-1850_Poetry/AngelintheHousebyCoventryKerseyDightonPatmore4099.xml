  <body>
   <p>There could be but one answer to the suggestion of Mr. Coventry Patmore that his “ Angel in the House ” might usefully have a place in this “ National Library . ” The suggestion was made with the belief that wide and cheap diffusion would not take from the value of a copyright library edition , while the best use of writing is fulfilled by the spreading of verse dedicated to the sacred love of home . The two parts of the Poem appeared in 1854 and 1856 , were afterwards elaborately revised , and have since obtained a permanent place among the Home Books of the English People . Our readers will join , surely , in thanks to the author for the present he has made us .</p>

     <l n="36">For she 's so simply , subtly sweet ,</l>

     <l n="42">On wings of love uplifted free ,</l>
     <l n="43">And by her gentleness made great ,</l>
     <l n="44">I 'll teach how noble man should be</l>

      <l n="51">Their praise of even the best desert</l>

      <l n="55">An easy , yea , delightful thing</l>

      <l n="63">Subjected to observances ,</l>
      <l n="64">To banquet goes with full delight ;</l>

      <l n="68">Nothing but spiritual joy .</l>
      <l n="69">They shine like Moses in the face ,</l>

     <lg type="stanza" n="1">
      <l n="1">She wearies with an ill unknown ;</l>
      <l n="2">In sleep she sobs and seems to float ,</l>
      <l n="3">A water-lily , all alone</l>
      <l n="4">Within a lonely castle-moat ;</l>
      <l n="5">And as the full-moon , spectral , lies</l>
      <l n="6">Within the crescent 's gleaming arms ,</l>
      <l n="7">The present shows her heedless eyes</l>
      <l n="8">A future dim with vague alarms .</l>
      <l n="9">She sees , and yet she scarcely sees ,</l>
      <l n="10">For , life-in-life not yet begun ,</l>
      <l n="11">Too many are its mysteries</l>
      <l n="12">For thought to fix on any one .</l>
      <l n="13">She 's told that maidens are by youths</l>
      <l n="14">Extremely honour 'd and desired ;</l>
      <l n="15">And sighs , ‘ If those sweet tales be truths ,</l>
      <l n="16">What bliss to be so much admired ! ’</l>
      <l n="17">The suitors come ; she sees them grieve ;</l>
      <l n="18">Her coldness fills them with despair ;</l>
      <l n="19">She 'd pity if she could believe ;</l>
      <l n="20">She 's sorry that she cannot care .</l>
      <l n="21">But who now meets her on her way ?</l>
      <l n="22">Comes he as enemy or friend ,</l>
      <l n="23">Or both ? Her bosom seems to say ,</l>
      <l n="24">He cannot pass , and there an end .</l>
      <l n="25">Whom does he love ? Does he confer</l>
      <l n="26">His heart on worth that answers his ?</l>
      <l n="27">Or is he come to worship her ?</l>
      <l n="28">She fears , she hopes , she thinks he is !</l>
      <l n="29">Advancing stepless , quick , and still ,</l>
      <l n="30">As in the grass a serpent glides ,</l>
      <l n="31">He fascinates her fluttering will ,</l>
      <l n="32">Then terrifies with dreadful strides .</l>
      <l n="33">At first , there 's nothing to resist ;</l>
      <l n="34">He fights with all the forms of peace ;</l>
      <l n="35">He comes about her like a mist ,</l>
      <l n="36">With subtle , swift , unseen increase ;</l>
      <l n="37">And then , unlook 'd for , strikes amain</l>
      <l n="38">Some stroke that frightens her to death ,</l>
      <l n="39">And grows all harmlessness again ,</l>
      <l n="40">Ere she can cry , or get her breath .</l>
      <l n="41">At times she stops , and stands at bay ;</l>
      <l n="42">But he , in all more strong than she ,</l>
      <l n="43">Subdues her with his pale dismay ,</l>
      <l n="44">Or more admired audacity .</l>
      <l n="45">She plans some final , fatal blow ,</l>
      <l n="46">But when she means with frowns to kill ,</l>
      <l n="47">He looks as if he loved her so ,</l>
      <l n="48">She smiles to him against her will .</l>
      <l n="49">How sweetly he implies her praise !</l>
      <l n="50">His tender talk , his gentle tone ,</l>
      <l n="51">The manly worship in his gaze ,</l>
      <l n="52">They nearly make her heart his own .</l>
      <l n="53">With what an air he speaks her name ;</l>
      <l n="54">His manner always recollects</l>
      <l n="55">Her sex , and still the woman 's claim</l>
      <l n="56">Is taught its scope by his respects .</l>
      <l n="57">Her charms , perceived to prosper first</l>
      <l n="58">In his beloved advertencies ,</l>
      <l n="59">When in her glass they are rehearsed ,</l>
      <l n="60">Prove his most powerful allies .</l>
      <l n="61">Ah , whither shall a maiden flee ,</l>
      <l n="62">When a bold youth so swift pursues ,</l>
      <l n="63">And siege of tenderest courtesy ,</l>
      <l n="64">With hope perseverant , still renews !</l>
      <l n="65">Why fly so fast ? Her flatter 'd breast</l>
      <l n="66">Thanks him who finds her fair and good ;</l>
      <l n="67">She loves her fears ; veil 'd joys arrest</l>
      <l n="68">The foolish terrors of her blood ;</l>
      <l n="69">By secret , sweet degrees , her heart ,</l>
      <l n="70">Vanquish 'd , takes warmth from his desire ;</l>
      <l n="71">She makes it more , with hidden art ,</l>
      <l n="72">And fuels love 's late dreaded fire .</l>
      <l n="73">The generous credit he accords</l>
      <l n="74">To all the signs of good in her</l>
      <l n="75">Redeems itself ; his praiseful words</l>
      <l n="76">The virtues they impute confer .</l>
      <l n="77">Her heart is thrice as rich in bliss ,</l>
      <l n="78">She 's three times gentler than before ;</l>
      <l n="79">He gains a right to call her his ,</l>
      <l n="80">Now she through him is so much more ;</l>
      <l n="81">‘ Tis heaven where'er she turns her head ;</l>
      <l n="82">‘ Tis music when she talks ; ‘ tis air</l>
      <l n="83">On which , elate , she seems to tread ,</l>
      <l n="84">The convert of a gladder sphere !</l>
      <l n="85">Ah , might he , when by doubts aggrieved ,</l>
      <l n="86">Behold his tokens next her breast ,</l>
      <l n="87">At all his words and sighs perceived</l>
      <l n="88">Against its blythe upheaval press 'd !</l>
      <l n="89">But still she flies . Should she be won ,</l>
      <l n="90">It must not be believed or thought</l>
      <l n="91">She yields ; she 's chased to death , undone ,</l>

      <l n="4">And flouts us with his Lady 's glove ;</l>
      <l n="5">How foreign is the garb he wears ;</l>
      <l n="6">And how his great devotion mocks</l>
      <l n="7">Our poor propriety , and scares</l>
      <l n="8">The undevout with paradox !</l>
      <l n="9">His soul , through scorn of worldly care ,</l>
      <l n="10">And great extremes of sweet and gall ,</l>
      <l n="11">And musing much on all that 's fair ,</l>

      <l n="15">In simply picturing his relief ,</l>
      <l n="16">That ‘ plaining seems to cure his plight ;</l>
      <l n="17">He makes his sorrow , when there 's none ;</l>

      <l n="23">She looks too happy and content ,</l>
      <l n="24">For whose least pleasure he would die ;</l>
      <l n="25">Oh , cruelty , she cannot care</l>
      <l n="26">For one to whom she 's always kind !</l>

      <l n="29">He 's jealous if she pets a dove ,</l>
      <l n="30">She must be his with all her soul ;</l>
      <l n="31">Yet ‘ tis a postulate in love</l>
      <l n="32">That part is greater than the whole ;</l>
      <l n="33">And all his apprehension 's stress ,</l>
      <l n="34">When he 's with her , regards her hair ,</l>
      <l n="35">Her hand , a ribbon of her dress ,</l>
      <l n="36">As if his life were only there ;</l>
      <l n="37">Because she 's constant , he will change ,</l>
      <l n="38">And kindest glances coldly meet ,</l>
      <l n="39">And , all the time he seems so strange ,</l>
      <l n="40">His soul is fawning at her feet ;</l>
      <l n="41">Of smiles and simple heaven grown tired ,</l>
      <l n="42">He wickedly provokes her tears ,</l>
      <l n="43">And when she weeps , as he desired ,</l>
      <l n="44">Falls slain with ecstasies of fears ;</l>
      <l n="45">He blames her , though she has no fault ,</l>
      <l n="46">Except the folly to be his ;</l>
      <l n="47">He worships her , the more to exalt</l>
      <l n="48">The profanation of a kiss ;</l>
      <l n="49">Health 's his disease , he 's never well</l>
      <l n="50">But when his paleness shames her rose ;</l>
      <l n="51">His faith 's a rock-built citadel ,</l>
      <l n="52">Its sign a flag that each way blows ;</l>
      <l n="53">His o'erfed fancy frets and fumes ;</l>
      <l n="54">And Love , in him , is fierce , like Hate ,</l>
      <l n="55">And ruffles his ambrosial plumes</l>
