   <div type="dedication">
    <p>TO EDWIN BOOTH . MY DEAR BOOTH : In offering these verses to you , I beg you to treat them ( as you have many a time advised a certain lord chamberlain to treat the players ) not according to their desert . “ Use them after your own honor and dignity ; the less they deserve , the more merit is in your bounty . ” These many years your friend and comrade , T. B. ALDRICH . NOTE The motif of the story embodied in the following poem was crudely outlined in a brief sketch printed in an early collection of the authors verse , and subsequently cancelled for a purpose not until now accomplished . Wyndham Towers is not to be confused with this discarded sketch , the text of which has furnished only a phrase , or an indirect suggestion , here and there . That the writer 's method , when recasting the poem , was more or less influenced by the poets he had been studying — chiefly the dramatists of the Elizabethan era — will , he hopes , be obvious . It was part of his design , however far he may have fallen from it , to give his narrative something of the atmosphere and color of the period in which the action takes place , though the story is supposed to be told at a later date .</p>

     <l n="2">Before you reach the slender , high-arched bridge ,</l>
     <l n="3">Like to a heron with one foot in stream ,</l>
     <l n="4">The hamlet breaks upon you through green boughs —</l>
     <l n="5">A square stone church within a place of graves</l>
     <l n="6">Upon the slope ; gray houses oddly grouped ,</l>
     <l n="7">With plastered gables set with crossed oak-beams ,</l>
     <l n="8">And roofs of yellow tile and purplish slate .</l>
     <l n="9">That is The Falcon , with the swinging sign</l>
     <l n="10">And rustic bench , an ancient hostelry ;</l>
     <l n="11">Those leaden lattices were hung on hinge</l>
     <l n="12">In good Queen Bess 's time , so old it is .</l>
     <l n="13">On ridge-piece , gable-end , or dove-cot vane ,</l>
     <l n="14">A gilded weathercock at intervals</l>
     <l n="15">Glimmers — an angel on the wing , most like ,</l>
     <l n="16">Of local workmanship ; for since the reign</l>
     <l n="17">Of pious Edward here have carvers thrived ,</l>
     <l n="18">In saints ’ - heads skillful and winged cherubim</l>
     <l n="19">Meet for rich abbeys . From yon crumbling tower ,</l>
     <l n="20">Whose brickwork base the cunning Romans laid —</l>
     <l n="21">And now of no use else except to train</l>
     <l n="22">The ivy of an idle legend on —</l>
     <l n="23">You see , such lens is this thin Devon air ,</l>
     <l n="24">If it so chance no fog comes rolling in ,</l>
     <l n="25">The Torridge where its branching crystal spreads</l>
     <l n="26">To join the Taw . Hard by from a chalk cliff</l>
     <l n="27">A torrent leaps : not lovelier Sappho was</l>
     <l n="28">Giving herself all silvery to the sea</l>
     <l n="29">From that Leucadian rock . Beneath your feet</l>
     <l n="30">Lie sand and surf in curving parallels .</l>
     <l n="31">Off shore , a buoy gleams like a dolphin 's back</l>
     <l n="32">Dripping with brine , and guards a sunken reef</l>
     <l n="33">Whose sharp incisors have gnawed many a keel ;</l>
     <l n="34">There frets the sea and turns white at the lip ,</l>
     <l n="35">And in ill-weather lets the ledge show fang .</l>
     <l n="36">A very pleasant nook in Devon , this ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="37">Upon the height of old was Wyndham Towers ,</l>
     <l n="38">Clinging to rock there , like an eagle 's nest ,</l>
     <l n="39">With moat and drawbridge once , and good for siege ;</l>
     <l n="40">Four towers it had to front the diverse winds :</l>
     <l n="41">Built God knows when , all record being lost ,</l>
     <l n="42">Locked in the memories of forgotten men .</l>
     <l n="43">In Caesar 's day , a pagan temple ; next</l>
     <l n="44">A monastery ; then a feudal hold ;</l>
     <l n="45">Later a manor , and at last a ruin .</l>
     <l n="46">Such knowledge have we of it , vaguely caught</l>
     <l n="47">Through whispers fallen from tradition 's lip .</l>
     <l n="48">This shattered tower , with crenellated top</l>
     <l n="49">And loops for archers , alone marks the spot ,</l>
     <l n="50">Looming forlornly — a gigantic harp</l>
     <l n="51">Whereon the invisible fingers of the wind</l>
     <l n="52">Its fitful and mysterious dirges play .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="53">Here dwelt , in the last Tudor 's virgin reign ,</l>
     <l n="54">One Richard Wyndham , Knight and Gentleman ,</l>
     <l n="55">( The son of Rawdon , slain near Calais wall</l>
     <l n="56">When Bloody Mary lost her grip on France ,)</l>
     <l n="57">A lonely wight that no kith had nor kin</l>
     <l n="58">Save one , a brother — by ill-fortune 's spite</l>
     <l n="59">A brother , since ‘ t were better to have none —</l>
     <l n="60">Of late not often seen at Wyndham Towers ,</l>
     <l n="61">Where he in sooth but lenten welcome got</l>
     <l n="62">When to that gate his errant footstep strayed .</l>
     <l n="63">Yet held he dear those gray majestic walls ,</l>
     <l n="64">Time-stained and crusted with the sea 's salt breath ;</l>
     <l n="65">There first his eyes took color of the sea ,</l>
     <l n="66">There did his heart stay when fate drove him thence ,</l>
     <l n="67">And there at last — but that we tell anon .</l>
     <l n="68">Darrell they named him , for an ancestor</l>
     <l n="69">Whose bones were whitening in Holy Land ,</l>
     <l n="70">The other Richard ; a crusader name ,</l>
     <l n="71">Yet it was Darrell had the lion-heart .</l>
     <l n="72">No love and little liking served this pair ,</l>
     <l n="73">In look and word unpaired as white and black —</l>
     <l n="74">Of once rich bough the last unlucky fruit .</l>
     <l n="75">The one , for straightness like a Norland pine</l>
     <l n="76">Set on some precipice 's perilous edge ,</l>
     <l n="77">Intrepid , handsome , little past blown youth ,</l>
     <l n="78">Of all pure thought and brave deed amorous ,</l>
     <l n="79">Moulded the court 's high atmosphere to breathe ,</l>
     <l n="80">Yet liking well the camp 's more liberal air —</l>
     <l n="81">Poet , soldier , courtier , ‘ t was the mode ;</l>
     <l n="82">The other — as a glow-worm to a star —</l>
     <l n="83">Suspicious , morbid , passionate , self-involved ,</l>
     <l n="84">The soul half eaten out with solitude ,</l>
     <l n="85">Corroded , like a sword-blade left in sheath</l>
     <l n="86">Asleep and lost to action — in a word ,</l>
     <l n="87">A misanthrope , a miser , a soured man ,</l>
     <l n="88">One fortune loved not and looked at askance .</l>
     <l n="89">Yet he a pleasant outward semblance had .</l>
     <l n="90">Say what you will , and paint things as you may ,</l>
     <l n="91">The devil is not black , with horn and hoof ,</l>
     <l n="92">As gossips picture him : he is a person</l>
     <l n="93">Quite scrupulous of doublet and demeanor ,</l>
     <l n="94">As was this Master Wyndham of The Towers ,</l>
     <l n="95">Now latterly in most unhappy case ,</l>
     <l n="96">Because of matters to be here set forth .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="97">A thing of not much moment , as life goes ,</l>
     <l n="98">A thing a man with some philosophy</l>
     <l n="99">Had idly brushed aside , as ‘ t were a gnat</l>
     <l n="100">That winged itself between him and the light ,</l>
     <l n="101">Had , through the crooked working of his mind ,</l>
     <l n="102">Brought Wyndham to a very grievous pass .</l>
     <l n="103">Yet ‘ t was a grapestone choked Anacreon</l>
     <l n="104">And hushed his song . There is no little thing</l>
     <l n="105">In nature : in a raindrop 's compass lie</l>
     <l n="106">A planet 's elements . This Wyndham 's woe</l>
     <l n="107">Was one Griselda , daughter to a man</l>
     <l n="108">Of Bideford , a shipman once , but since</l>
     <l n="109">Turned soldier ; now in white-haired , wrinkled age</l>
     <l n="110">Sitting beneath the olive , valiant still ,</l>
     <l n="111">With sword on nail above the chimney-shelf</l>
     <l n="112">In case the Queen should need its edge again .</l>
     <l n="113">An officer he was , though lowly born .</l>
     <l n="114">The man aforetime , in the Netherlands</l>
     <l n="115">And through those ever-famous French campaigns</l>
     <l n="116">( Marry , in what wars bore he not a hand ? )</l>
     <l n="117">In Rawdon Wyndham 's troop of horse had served ,</l>
     <l n="118">And when he fell that day by Calais wall</l>
     <l n="119">Had from the Frenchmen 's pikes his body snatched ,</l>
     <l n="120">And so much saved of him , which was not much ,</l>
     <l n="121">The good knight being dead . For this deed 's sake ,</l>
     <l n="122">That did enlarge itself in sorrow 's eye ,</l>
     <l n="123">The widow deemed all guerdon all too small ,</l>
     <l n="124">And held her dear lord 's servant and his girl ,</l>
     <l n="125">Born later , when that clash of steel was done ,</l>
     <l n="126">As her own kin , till she herself was laid</l>
     <l n="127">I ’ the earth and sainted elsewhere . The two sons</l>
     <l n="128">Let cool the friendship : one in foreign parts</l>
     <l n="129">Did gold and honor seek ; at hall stayed one ,</l>
     <l n="130">The heir , and now of old friends negligent :</l>
     <l n="131">Thus fortune hardens the ignoble heart .</l>
     <l n="132">Griselda even as a little maid ,</l>
     <l n="133">Demure , but with more crotchets in the brain ,</l>
     <l n="134">I warrant ye , than minutes to the hour ,</l>
     <l n="135">Had this one much misliked ; in her child-thought</l>
     <l n="136">Confused him somehow with those cruel shapes</l>
     <l n="137">Of iron men that up there at The Towers</l>
     <l n="138">Quickened her pulse . For he was gaunt , his face ,</l>
     <l n="139">Mature beyond the logic of his years ,</l>
     <l n="140">Had in it something sinister and grim ,</l>
     <l n="141">Like to the visage pregnant fancy saw</l>
     <l n="142">Behind the bars of each disused casque</l>
     <l n="143">In that east chamber where the harness hung</l>
     <l n="144">And dinted shields of Wyndhams gone to grace —</l>
     <l n="145">At Poitiers this one , this at Agincourt ,</l>
     <l n="146">That other on the sands of Palestine :</l>
     <l n="147">A breed of fierce man-slayers , sire and son .</l>
     <l n="148">Of these seemed Richard , with his steel cross-bow</l>
     <l n="149">Killing the doves in very wantonness —</l>
     <l n="150">The gentle doves that to the ramparts came</l>
     <l n="151">For scattered crumbs , undreamful of all ill .</l>
     <l n="152">Each well-sent dart that stained a snowy breast</l>
     <l n="153">Straight to her own white-budding bosom went .</l>
     <l n="154">Fled were those summers now , and she had passed</l>
     <l n="155">Out of the child-world of vain fantasy</l>
     <l n="156">Where many a rainbow castle lay in ruin ;</l>
     <l n="157">But to her mind , like wine-stain to a flask ,</l>
     <l n="158">The old distrust still clung , indelible ,</l>
     <l n="159">Holding her in her maidhood 's serious prime</l>
     <l n="160">Well pleased from his cold eyes to move apart ,</l>
     <l n="161">And in her humble fortunes dwell secure .</l>
     <l n="162">Indeed , what was she ?— a poor soldier 's girl ,</l>
     <l n="163">Merely a tenant 's daughter . Times were changed ,</l>
     <l n="164">And life 's bright web had sadder colors in ‘ t :</l>
     <l n="165">That most sweet gentle lady — rest her soul !—</l>
     <l n="166">Shrunk to an epitaph beside her lord 's ,</l>
     <l n="167">And six lines shorter , which was all a shame ;</l>
     <l n="168">Gaunt Richard heir ; that other at earth 's end ,</l>
     <l n="169">( The younger son that was her sweetheart once ,)</l>
     <l n="170">Fighting the Spaniards , getting slain perchance ;</l>
     <l n="171">And all dear old-time uses quite forgot .</l>
     <l n="172">Slowly , unnoted , like the creeping rust</l>
     <l n="173">That spreads insidious , had estrangement come ,</l>
     <l n="174">Until at last , one knew not how it fell ,</l>
     <l n="175">And little cared , if sober truth were said ,</l>
     <l n="176">She and the father no more climbed the hill</l>
     <l n="177">To Twelfth Night festival or May-day dance ,</l>
     <l n="178">Nor commerce had with any at The Towers .</l>
     <l n="179">Yet in a formless , misty sort of way</l>
     <l n="180">The girl had place in Wyndham 's mind — the girl ,</l>
     <l n="181">Why , yes , beshrew him ! it was even she</l>
     <l n="182">Whom his soft mother had made favorite of ,</l>
     <l n="183">And well-nigh spoiled , some dozen summers gone .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="184">Perhaps because dull custom made her tame ,</l>
     <l n="185">Or that she was not comely in the bud ,</l>
     <l n="186">Her sweetness halting like a tardy May</l>
     <l n="187">That wraps itself in mist , and seems not fair ,</l>
     <l n="188">For this or finer reason undivined ,</l>
     <l n="189">His thought she touched not , and was glad withal</l>
     <l n="190">When she did note how others took his eye</l>
     <l n="191">And wore rue after . Thus was her white peace</l>
     <l n="192">Undarkened till , it so befell , these two</l>
     <l n="193">Meeting as they a hundred times had met</l>
     <l n="194">On hill-path or at crossing of the weir ,</l>
     <l n="195">Her beauty broke on him like some rare flower</l>
     <l n="196">That was not yesterday . Ev'n so the Spring</l>
     <l n="197">Unclasps the girdle of its loveliness</l>
     <l n="198">Abruptly , in the North here : long the drifts</l>
     <l n="199">Linger in hollows , long on bough and briar</l>
     <l n="200">No slight leaf ventures , lest the frost 's keen tooth</l>
     <l n="201">Nip it , and then all suddenly the earth</l>
     <l n="202">Is nought but scent and bloom . So unto him</l>
     <l n="203">Griselda 's grace unclosed . Where lagged his wit</l>
     <l n="204">That guessed not of the bud that slept in stem ,</l>
     <l n="205">Nor hint had of the flower within the bud ?</l>
     <l n="206">If so much beauty had a tiger been ,</l>
     <l n="207">‘ T had eaten him ! In all the wave-washed length</l>
     <l n="208">Of rocky Devon where was found her like</l>
     <l n="209">For excellence of wedded red and white ?</l>
     <l n="210">Here on that smooth and sunny field , her cheek ,</l>
     <l n="211">The hostile hues of Lancaster and York</l>
     <l n="212">Did meet , and , blending , make a heavenly truce ,</l>
     <l n="213">This were indeed a rose a king might wear</l>
     <l n="214">Upon his bosom . By St. Dunstan , now ,</l>
     <l n="215">Himself would wear it . Then by seeming chance</l>
     <l n="216">Crossed he her walks , and stayed her with discourse</l>
     <l n="217">Devised adroitly ; spoke of common things</l>
     <l n="218">At first — of days when his good mother lived ,</l>
     <l n="219">If ‘ t were to live , to pass long dolorous hours</l>
     <l n="220">Before his father 's effigy in church ;</l>
     <l n="221">Of one who then used often come to hall ,</l>
     <l n="222">Ever at Yule-tide , when the great log flamed</l>
     <l n="223">In chimney-place , and laugh and jest went round ,</l>
     <l n="224">And maidens strayed beneath the mistletoe ,</l>
     <l n="225">Making believe not see it , so got kissed —</l>
     <l n="226">Of one that joined not in the morrice-dance ,</l>
     <l n="227">But in her sea-green kirtle stood at gaze ,</l>
     <l n="228">A timid little creature that was scared</l>
     <l n="229">By dead men 's armor . Nought there suffered change ,</l>
     <l n="230">Those empty shells of valor grew not old ,</l>
     <l n="231">Though something rusty . Would they fright her now</l>
     <l n="232">Looked she upon them ? Held she in her mind —</l>
     <l n="233">‘ T was Spring and loud the mavis piped outside —</l>
     <l n="234">The day the Turkish helmet slipped from peg ,</l>
     <l n="235">And clashing on the floor , congealed her blood</l>
     <l n="236">And sent both hands to terror-smitten eyes ,</l>
     <l n="237">She trembling , ready to yield up the ghost ?</l>
     <l n="238">Right merry was it ! Finally he touched</l>
     <l n="239">On matters nearer , things she had foreboded</l>
     <l n="240">And this one time must needs lend hearing to ,</l>
     <l n="241">And end so sorry business ere woe came ,</l>
     <l n="242">Like a true maid and honest , as she was .</l>
     <l n="243">So , tutoring the tremble on her lip</l>
     <l n="244">And holding back hot tears , she gave reply</l>
     <l n="245">With such discretion as straight tied his tongue ,</l>
     <l n="246">Albeit he lacked not boldness in discourse :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="247">“ Indeed , indeed , sir , you speak but in jest !</l>
     <l n="248">Lightly , not meaning it , in courtier-way .</l>

     <l n="270">Knelt there impassive , like the marble girl</l>

     <l n="543">Off Cadiz . Ah , and softer dreams he had</l>
     <l n="544">Of an unnamed and sweetest mystery ,</l>
     <l n="545">And from the marble of his soul 's desire</l>
     <l n="546">Hewed out the white ideal of his love —</l>
     <l n="547">A new Pygmalion ! All things drew him home ,</l>

     <l n="549">Dear earth of England his propitious fame</l>
     <l n="550">A thorn in none but crooked Envy 's side ,</l>

     <l n="553">Looping one side up very gallantly ,</l>
     <l n="554">And changed his doublet 's color twice a day .</l>
     <l n="555">Ill fare had given his softer senses edge ;</l>
     <l n="556">Good fortune , later , bade him come to dine ,</l>
     <l n="557">Mild Spenser 's scholar , Philip Sidney 's friend .</l>
     <l n="558">So took he now his ease ; in Devonshire ,</l>

     <l n="560">For sight of Wyndham Towers against the sky ;</l>
     <l n="561">But chiefly did he bask him by the Thames ,</l>

     <l n="568">So Wyndham , shrinking from the very stars</l>
     <l n="569">And tell-tale places where the moonlight fell ,</l>
     <l n="570">Crept through the huddled shadows back to hall ,</l>

     <l n="573">Sat pondering his hurt , and in the dark</l>

     <l n="576">But it brings with it comrades of its hue .</l>
     <l n="577">So did he fall to thinking how his day</l>

     <l n="579">Obscurely through an age of great events</l>
     <l n="580">Such as men never saw , nor will again</l>
     <l n="581">Until the globe be riven by God 's fire .</l>
     <l n="582">Others had ventured for the Golden Fleece ,</l>
     <l n="583">Knaves of no parts at all , and got renown ,</l>
     <l n="584">( By force of circumstance and not desert ,)</l>
     <l n="585">While he up there on that rock-bastioned coast</l>

     <l n="599">What mattered it ? At worst man dies but once —</l>
     <l n="600">So far as known . One may not master death ,</l>
     <l n="601">But life should be one 's lackey . He had been</l>
     <l n="602">Time 's dupe and bondsman ; ever since his birth</l>
     <l n="603">Had walked this planet with his eye oblique ,</l>
     <l n="604">Grasped what was worthless , what were most dear missed ;</l>

     <l n="606">Fame gets a man in England — the Queen 's smile ,</l>
     <l n="607">Which means , when she ‘ s in humor , abbey-lands ,</l>
     <l n="608">Appointments , stars and ribbons for the breast ,</l>

     <l n="621">And have each rascal that prowls under heaven</l>
     <l n="622">Stab one for getting it ? Had he wished power ,</l>
     <l n="623">The thing was in the market-place for sale</l>
     <l n="624">At stated rates — so much for a man 's soul !</l>
     <l n="625">His was a haughty spirit that bent not ,</l>
     <l n="626">And one to rise had need to cringe and creep .</l>
     <l n="627">So had his brother into favor crawled ,</l>
     <l n="628">Like slug into the bosom of a rose ,</l>
     <l n="629">And battened in the sun . At thought of him ,</l>

     <l n="643">It is his brave apparel dazzles her .</l>
     <l n="644">Thus puts he bound and barrier to my love .</l>

     <l n="646">I 'll have no more of him ! If I but dared —</l>
     <l n="647">Nay , I dare not . I have fawn 's blood , I think ;</l>
     <l n="648">I would , and dare not ! ” Thrice the hooded clock</l>
     <l n="649">Solemnly , like some old Carthusian monk</l>
     <l n="650">With meagre face half seen beneath his cowl ,</l>
     <l n="651">Intoned the quarter . Memory went not back</l>
     <l n="652">When this was not a most familiar sound ,</l>
     <l n="653">Yet as each stroke on the dead silence fell</l>
     <l n="654">Wyndham turned , startled . Now the sanguine moon ,</l>
     <l n="655">To clouded opal changing momently ,</l>
     <l n="656">Rose sheer above the pine-trees ’ ragged edge ,</l>
     <l n="657">And through the wide-flung casement reaching hand</l>

     <l n="663">Menacing , terrible , this instant stood ,</l>

     <l n="669">Half crouched upon the settle with his nails</l>
