    <head>PREFACE .</head>
    <p n="1">When city people go among forests and hills , they drink in the fresh air and weird scenery of rural surroundings , with much more relish , enjoyment , and appreciation , than do the life-long residents they find there .</p>
    <p n="2">For the same reason , the great drama of metropolitan existence falls most forcibly upon those just from the clear streams and green meadows of the country . Their impressions then are deeper , and their feelings more intense than if they were city born and bred .</p>
    <p n="3">With the latter fact in view , this book is an effort to reproduce some of the effects of city scenes and character upon the intellect and imagination of two people from the country :</p>
    <p n="4">First , a young student , who has travelled the well-beaten roads of a college course , but is just entering real life , and now for the first time walks the paved and palace-bordered streets of which he has heard and read so much .</p>
    <p n="5">Second , an old farmer , with very little “ book-learning , ” but a clear brain , a warm heart , and independent judgment , and a habit of philosophizing upon everything he sees , which habit he brings to the city , and applies to the strange facts he witnesses .</p>
    <p n="6">These , with certain incidental thoughts and characters encountered and discussed , constitute the present work . It will be found , as intended , sketchy and suggestive rather than elaborate and complete . Note-books and diaries are designed , not so much for the history of a career or an event , as a light to the memory , a stimulus to the imagination , and a help to the heart .</p>
    <p n="7">It is the hope of the author that his book may perform those offices for you , his readers , and that it will rouse your pity of pain , your enjoyment of honest mirth , your hatred of sham and wrong , and your love and adoration of the Resolute and the Good , and their winsome child , the Beautiful .</p>
    <p n="8">In which case he shakes hands with his large and loved constituency , and continues happy .</p>

     <l n="1">[ From Arthur Selwyn 's Note-book . ]</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="2">Here in The City I ponder ,</l>
     <l n="3">Through its long pathways I wander .</l>
     <l n="4">These are the spires that were gleaming</l>
     <l n="5">All through my juvenile dreaming .</l>
     <l n="6">This is The Something I heard , far away ,</l>
     <l n="7">When , at the close of a tired Summer day ,</l>
     <l n="8">Resting from work on the lap of a lawn ,</l>
     <l n="9">Gazing to whither The Sun-god had gone ,</l>
     <l n="10">Leaving behind him his mantles of gold —</l>
     <l n="11">This is The Something by which I was told ;</l>
     <l n="12">“ Bend your head , dreamer , and listen —</l>
     <l n="13">Come to my splendors that glisten !</l>
     <l n="14">Either to triumph they call you ,</l>
     <l n="15">Or to what worst could befall you ! ”</l>
     <l n="16">This is The Something that thrilled my desires ,</l>
     <l n="17">When the weird Morning had kindled his fires ,</l>
     <l n="18">And the gray city of clouds in the east</l>
     <l n="19">Lighted its streets as for pageant or feast ,</l>
     <l n="20">Whisp'ring — my spirit elating —</l>
     <l n="21">“ Come to me , boy , I am waiting !</l>
     <l n="22">Bring me your muscle and spirit and brain —</l>
     <l n="23">Here to my glory-strewn , ruin-strewn plain ! ”</l>
     <l n="24">Treading the trough of the furrow ,</l>
     <l n="25">Digging where life-rootlets burrow ,</l>
     <l n="26">Blade of the food-harvest swinging ,</l>
     <l n="27">In the barns toiling and singing ,</l>
     <l n="28">Breath of a hay-meadow smelling ,</l>
     <l n="29">Forest-trees loving and felling —</l>
     <l n="30">Where'er my spirit was turning ,</l>
     <l n="31">Lived that mysterious yearning !</l>
     <l n="32">When in the old country school-house I conned</l>
     <l n="33">Legends of life in the broad world beyond —</l>
     <l n="34">When in the trim hamlet-college I cast</l>
     <l n="35">Wondering glances at days that were past —</l>
     <l n="36">Ever I longed for the walls and the streets ,</l>
     <l n="37">And the rich conflict that energy meets !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="38">So I have come : but The City is great</l>
     <l n="39">Bearing me down like a brute with its weight .</l>
     <l n="40">So I have come : but The City is cold ,</l>
     <l n="41">And I am lonelier now than of old .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="42">Yet , ‘ tis the same restless story :</l>
     <l n="43">Even to fail here were glory !</l>
     <l n="44">Grand , to be part of this ocean</l>
     <l n="45">Of matter and mind and emotion !</l>
     <l n="46">Here flow the streams of endeavor ,</l>
     <l n="47">Cityward trending forever .—</l>
     <l n="48">Wheat-stalks that tassel the field ,</l>
     <l n="49">Harvests of opulent yield ,</l>
     <l n="50">Grass-blades that fence with each other ,</l>
     <l n="51">Flower-blossoms — sister and brother —</l>
     <l n="52">Roots that are sturdy and tender ,</l>
     <l n="53">Stalks in your thrift and your splendor ,</l>
     <l n="54">Mind that is fertile and daring ,</l>
     <l n="55">Face that true beauty is wearing —</l>
     <l n="56">All that is strongest and fleetest ,</l>
     <l n="57">All that are dainty and sweetest .</l>
     <l n="58">Look to the domes and the glittering spires ,</l>
     <l n="59">Waiting for you with majestic desires !</l>
     <l n="60">List to The City 's gaunt , thunderous roar ,</l>
     <l n="61">Calling and calling for you evermore !</l>
     <l n="62">Long in the fields you may labor and wait —</l>
     <l n="63">You and your tribe may come early or late ;</l>
     <l n="64">Beauty and excellence dwell and will dwell</l>
     <l n="65">Oft amid garden and moorland and fell ;</l>
     <l n="66">Long generations may hold them ,</l>
     <l n="67">Centuries oft can enfold them ;</l>
     <l n="68">But the rich City 's they some time shall be ,</l>
     <l n="69">Sure as the spring is the food of the sea .</l>

    <head>SEPTEMBER 20 , 18 —.</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Wind in the south-west ; weather wondrous fine ;</l>
     <l n="2">Thermometer ‘ twixt seventy-eight and nine .</l>
     <l n="3">Ground rather dry ; sun flails us over-warm ;</l>
     <l n="4">It 's most time for the equinoctial storm .</l>
     <l n="5">Family healthy as could be desired ;</l>
     <l n="6">Except we 're somewhat mind and body tired</l>
     <l n="7">At moving over such a lengthy road ,</l>
     <l n="8">And settling down here in our town abode ,</l>
     <l n="9">And wrestling with the pains that filter through one</l>
     <l n="10">When he gives up an old home for a new one .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="11">Old Calendar , you 've always stood me true ;</l>
     <l n="12">Now I 'll change works , and do the same by you !</l>
     <l n="13">You 're just as good as when , with aching arm ,</l>
     <l n="14">I cleared and worked that eighty-acre farm !</l>
     <l n="15">And every night , in those hard , dear old days ,</l>
     <l n="16">‘ Twas one of my most unconditional ways ,</l>
     <l n="17">When to my labors I had said Good-night ,</l>
     <l n="18">And recompensed my home-made appetite ,</l>
     <l n="19">And talked with Wife , and traded family views ,</l>
     <l n="20">And gathered all the latest township news ,</l>
     <l n="21">And dealt my sons a sly fraternal hit ,</l>
     <l n="22">And flirted with my daughters just a bit ,</l>
     <l n="23">And through the papers tried my way to see ,</l>
     <l n="24">So the world should n't slip out from under me ,</l>
     <l n="25">As I was saying — in those sweet old days ,</l>
     <l n="26">‘ Twas one of my most unconditional ways ,</l>
     <l n="27">To go to you , old book , before I 'd sleep ,</l>
     <l n="28">And hand you over all the day to keep .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="29">I gave you up what weather I could find ,</l>
     <l n="30">Likewise the different phases of my mind ;</l>
     <l n="31">What my hard hands from morn to night had done ,</l>
     <l n="32">And what my mind had been subsisting on ;</l>
     <l n="33">What accidents had touched my brain with doubt ,</l>
     <l n="34">And what successes it had whittled out ;</l>
     <l n="35">How well I had been able to control</l>
     <l n="36">The weather fluctuations of my soul ;</l>
     <l n="37">What progress or what failures I had made</l>
     <l n="38">In spying round and stealing Nature 's trade ;</l>
     <l n="39">The seeds of actions planted long ago ,</l>
     <l n="40">And whether they had blossomed out or no ;</l>
     <l n="41">And oft , from what you of the past could tell ,</l>
     <l n="42">I 've learned to steer my future pretty well .</l>

     <l n="43">And now I 'M RICH ( who ever thought ‘ twould be ! )</l>

     <l n="45">And now I 'm “ City people ” — having moved</l>
     <l n="46">( My circumstances suddenly improved )</l>
     <l n="47">Into this town , with some quick-gotten pelf ,</l>
     <l n="48">To educate my children and myself ,</l>
     <l n="49">And give my wife , who has a pedigree ,</l>
     <l n="50">A chance to flutter round her family tree ,</l>
     <l n="51">And show her natural city airs and graces</l>
     <l n="52">( Which did n't “ take ” quite so well in country places )</l>

     <l n="54">I 'll give you all the news from day to day .</l>
     <l n="55">I 'll find the good that in this city lurks ,</l>
     <l n="56">By regular , systematic , hard days ’ works ;</l>
     <l n="57">I 'll rummage fearless round amongst the harm ,</l>
     <l n="58">As when I hoed up thistles on my farm ;</l>
     <l n="59">Shake hands with Virtue , help Sin while I spurn it ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="61">How little I suspected , by the way —</l>
     <l n="62">Scrambling for pennies in that patch of clay ,</l>
     <l n="63">The bare expenses of our lives to meet —</l>
     <l n="64">That waves of wealth were washing at my feet !</l>
     <l n="65">And when my hard and rather lazy soil</l>
     <l n="66">Sprung a leak upward with petroleum-oil —</l>
     <l n="67">When , through the wonder in my glad old eyes ,</l>
     <l n="68">I saw tall derricks by the hundred rise ,</l>
     <l n="69">Flinging wealth at me with unceasing hand ,</l>
     <l n="70">And turning to a mine my hard old land ,</l>
     <l n="71">Until it seemed as if the spell would hold</l>
     <l n="72">Till every blade of grass was turned to gold —</l>
     <l n="73">I felt , as never yet had come to me ,</l>
     <l n="74">How little round the curves of life we see ;</l>
     <l n="75">Or , in our rushings on , suspect or view</l>
     <l n="76">What sort of stations we are coming to !</l>
     <l n="77">It brought a similar twinge — though not so bad —</l>

     <l n="79">But still it could not shift my general views ;</l>

     <l n="87">‘ Twould never do , as I informed my wife ,</l>

     <l n="1">Sweet virtue , virtue , virtue !— what a start</l>
     <l n="2">You 've got here in this city 's feverish heart !</l>
     <l n="3">There is n't a thing to do that 's square and right ,</l>
     <l n="4">But some one 's here to teach it , day and night ;</l>

     <l n="7">And then the churches — thick and rich of yield ,</l>

     <l n="15">And then the missions — regular district schools ,</l>
     <l n="16">Where transient men are taught eternal rules ;</l>
     <l n="17">Then the Salvation Army girls and boys ,</l>

     <l n="34">Have toiled where convict labor whirls and clanks ,</l>
     <l n="35">Have made hard beds in cramped and lonely cells ,</l>
     <l n="36">Have sinned their way through several different hells ;</l>
     <l n="37">Whose lives have been so terribly amiss</l>
     <l n="38">To ever find worse worlds than they 've made this ;</l>

     <l n="44">“ I 've been as bad , or worse , than you are now . ”</l>

     <l n="20">Rather weak in the joints ;</l>

     <l n="30">Who this loud racket made ,</l>
     <l n="31">Were not bounded by race</l>
     <l n="32">Or condition or shade .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="33">Now I love my own meeting ,</l>

     <l n="113">Then the banjo struck in ,</l>

     <l n="139">I would step in between —</l>

     <l n="141">They who draw souls above</l>

     <l n="115">Severed — the black cords that bound me !</l>
     <l n="116">No more my spirit is weary ;</l>
     <l n="117">I have a home , bright and cheery ;</l>
     <l n="118">Full of love 's sweet , saving leaven :</l>
     <l n="119">Home is the daughter of Heaven .</l>
