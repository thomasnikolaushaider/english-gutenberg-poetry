   <p>JOHN JONES 'S WIFE</p>
    <p>I</p>
   <p>AT THE PIANO</p>
    <p>I</p>
   <p>Love me and leave me ; what love bids retrieve me ? can June 's fist grasp May ? Leave me and love me ; hopes eyed once above me like spring 's sprouts decay ; Fall as the snow falls , when summer leaves grow false — cards packed for storm 's play !</p>
    <p>II</p>
   <p>Nay , say Decay 's self be but last May 's elf , wing shifted , eye sheathed — Changeling in April 's crib rocked , who lets ‘ scape rills locked fast since frost breathed — Skin cast ( think ! ) adder-like , now bloom bursts bladder-like ,— bloom frost bequeathed ?</p>
   <p>III</p>
   <p>Ah , how can fear sit and hear as love hears it grief 's heart 's cracked grate 's screech ? Chance lets the gate sway that opens on hate 's way and shews on shame 's beach Crouched like an imp sly change watch sweet love 's shrimps lie , a toothful in each .</p>
    <p>IV</p>
   <p>Time feels his tooth slip on husks wet from Truth 's lip , which drops them and grins — Shells where no throb stirs of life left in lobsters since joy thrilled their fins — Hues of the prawn 's tail or comb that makes dawn stale , so red for our sins !</p>
   <p>V</p>
   <p>Years blind and deaf use the soul 's joys as refuse , heart 's peace as manure , Reared whence , next June 's rose shall bloom where our moons rose last year , just as pure : Moons ’ ends match roses ’ ends : men by beasts ’ noses ’ ends mete sin 's stink 's cure .</p>
    <p>VI</p>
   <p>Leaves love last year smelt now feel dead love 's tears melt — flies caught in time 's mesh ! Salt are the dews in which new time breeds new sin , brews blood and stews flesh ; Next year may see dead more germs than this weeded and reared them afresh .</p>
   <p>VII</p>
   <p>Old times left perish , there 's new time to cherish ; life just shifts its tune ; As , when the day dies , earth , half afraid , eyes the growth of the moon ; Love me and save me , take me or waive me ; death takes one so soon !</p>

     <l n="1">The sickly airs had died of damp ;</l>
     <l n="2">Through huddling leaves the holy chime</l>
     <l n="3">Flagged ; I , expecting Mrs. Gamp ,</l>
     <l n="4">Thought — “ Will the woman come in time ? ”</l>
     <l n="5">Upstairs I knew the matron bed</l>

     <l n="14">I heard the Monthly give a sniff</l>
     <l n="15">And “ if the big dog makes the pup — ”</l>

     <l n="22">There , straddling one red arm and leg ,</l>
     <l n="23">Lay my last work , in length a span ,</l>
     <l n="24">Half hatched , and conscious of the egg .</l>
     <l n="25">A creditable child , I hoped ;</l>

     <l n="34">I drew the strings about its waist ;</l>
     <l n="35">Pink as the unshell 'd inner fruit ,</l>
     <l n="36">But barely decent , hardly chaste ,</l>
     <l n="37">Its nudity had startled me ;</l>

     <l n="49">And I was glad as one who sees</l>
     <l n="50">For sensual optics things unmeet :</l>
     <l n="51">As purity makes passion freeze ,</l>
     <l n="52">So faith warns science off her beat .</l>

     <l n="59">Truth pins her trust on falsehood 's sleeve ,</l>
     <l n="60">While reason blunders by the book .</l>
     <l n="61">Then Mrs. Prig addressed me thus ;</l>

    <head>LAST WORDS OF A SEVENTH-RATE POET</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Bill , I feel far from quite right — if not further : already the pill</l>
     <l n="2">Seems , if I may say so , to bubble inside me . A poet 's heart , Bill ,</l>
     <l n="3">Is a sort of a thing that is made of the tenderest young bloom on a fruit .</l>
     <l n="4">You may pass me the mixture at once , if you please — and I 'll thank you</l>
     <l n="5">to boot</l>
     <l n="6">For that poem — and then for the julep . This really is damnable stuff !</l>
     <l n="7">( Not the poem , of course . ) Do you snivel , old friend ? well , it 's nasty</l>
     <l n="8">enough ,</l>
     <l n="9">But I think I can stand it — I think so — ay , Bill , and I could were it</l>
     <l n="10">worse .</l>
     <l n="11">But I 'll tell you a thing that I can n't and I wo n't . ‘ Tis the old , old</l>
     <l n="12">curse —</l>
     <l n="13">The gall of the gold-fruited Eden , the lure of the angels that fell .</l>
     <l n="14">‘ Tis the core of the fruit snake-spotted in the hush of the shadows of</l>
     <l n="15">hell ,</l>
     <l n="16">Where a lost man sits with his head drawn down , and a weight on his eyes .</l>
     <l n="17">You know what I mean , Bill — the tender and delicate mother of lies ,</l>
     <l n="18">Woman , the devil 's first cousin — no doubt by the female side .</l>
     <l n="19">The breath of her mouth still moves in my hair , and I know that she lied ,</l>
     <l n="20">And I feel her , Bill , sir , inside me — she operates there like a drug .</l>
     <l n="21">Were it better to live like a beetle , to wear the cast clothes of a slug ,</l>
     <l n="22">Be the louse in the locks of the hangman , the mote in the eye of the bat ,</l>
     <l n="23">Than to live and believe in a woman , who must one day grow aged and fat ?</l>
     <l n="24">You must see it 's preposterous , Bill , sir . And yet , how the thought of</l>
     <l n="25">it clings !</l>
     <l n="26">I have lived out my time — I have prigged lots of verse — I have kissed</l>
     <l n="27">( ah , that stings ! )</l>
     <l n="28">Lips that swore I had cribbed every line that I wrote on them — cribbed —</l>
     <l n="29">honour bright !</l>
     <l n="30">Then I loathed her ; but now I forgive her ; perhaps after all she was right .</l>
     <l n="31">Yet I swear it was shameful — unwomanly , Bill , sir — to say that I fibbed .</l>
     <l n="32">Why , the poems were mine , for I bought them in print . Cribbed ? of course</l>
     <l n="33">they were cribbed .</l>
     <l n="34">Yet I would n't say , cribbed from the French — Lady Bathsheba thought it</l>
     <l n="35">was vulgar —</l>
     <l n="36">But picked up on the banks of the Don , from the lips of a highly</l>
     <l n="37">intelligent Bulgar .</l>
     <l n="38">I 'm aware , Bill , that 's out of all metre — I can n't help it — I 'm none of</l>
     <l n="39">your sort</l>
     <l n="40">Who set metres , by Jove , above morals — not exactly . They do n't go to</l>
     <l n="41">Court —</l>
     <l n="42">As I mentioned one night to that cowslip-faced pet , Lady Rahab Redrabbit</l>
     <l n="43">( Whom the Marquis calls Drabby for short ) . Well , I say , if you want a</l>
     <l n="44">thing , grab it —</l>
     <l n="45">That 's what I did , at least , when I took that danseuse to a swell</l>
     <l n="46">cabaret ,</l>
     <l n="47">Where expense was no consideration . A poet , you see , now and then must</l>
     <l n="48">be gay .</l>
     <l n="49">( I declined to give more , I remember , than fifty centeems to the waiter ;</l>
     <l n="50">For I asked him if that was enough ; and the jackanapes answered —</l>
     <l n="51">Peut-être .</l>
     <l n="52">Ah , it is n't in you to draw up a menu such as ours was , though humble :</l>
     <l n="53">When I told Lady Shoreditch , she thought it a regular grand tout</l>
     <l n="54">ensemble . )</l>
     <l n="55">She danced the heart out of my body — I can see in the glare of the lights ,</l>
     <l n="56">I can see her again as I saw her that evening , in spangles and tights .</l>
     <l n="57">When I spoke to her first , her eye flashed so , I heard — as I</l>
     <l n="58">fancied — the spark whiz</l>
     <l n="59">From her eyelid — I said so next day to that jealous old fool of a Marquis .</l>
     <l n="60">She reminded me , Bill , of a lovely volcano , whose entrails are lava —</l>
     <l n="61">Or ( you know my penchant for original types ) of the upas in Java .</l>
     <l n="62">In the curve of her sensitive nose was a singular species of dimple ,</l>
     <l n="63">Where the flush was the mark of an angel 's creased kiss — if it was n't</l>
     <l n="64">a pimple .</l>
     <l n="65">Now I 'm none of your bashful John Bulls who do n't know a pilau from a</l>
     <l n="66">puggaree</l>
     <l n="67">Nor a chili , by George , from a chopstick . So , sir , I marched into her</l>
     <l n="68">snuggery ,</l>
     <l n="69">And proposed a light supper by way of a finish . I treated her , Bill ,</l>
     <l n="70">To six entrées of ortolans , sprats , maraschino , and oysters . It made</l>
     <l n="71">her quite ill .</l>
     <l n="72">Of which moment of sickness I took some advantage . I held her like this ,</l>
     <l n="73">And availed myself , sir , of her sneezing , to shut up her lips with a kiss .</l>
     <l n="74">The waiters , I saw , were quite struck ; and I felt , I may say , entre nous ,</l>
     <l n="75">Like Don Juan , Lauzun , Almaviva , Lord Byron , and old Richelieu .</l>
     <l n="76">( You 'll observe , Bill , that rhyme 's quite Parisian ; a Londoner , sir ,</l>
     <l n="77">would have cited old Q .</l>
     <l n="78">People tell me the French in my verses recalls that of Jeames or John</l>
     <l n="79">Thomas : I</l>
     <l n="80">Must maintain it 's as good as the average accent of British diplomacy . )</l>
     <l n="81">These are moments that thrill the whole spirit with spasms that excite</l>
     <l n="82">and exalt .</l>
     <l n="83">I stood more than the peer of the great Casanova — you know — de Seingalt .</l>
     <l n="84">She was worth , sir , I say it without hesitation , two brace of her sisters .</l>
     <l n="85">Ah , why should all honey turn rhubarb — all cherries grow onions — all</l>
     <l n="86">kisses leave blisters ?</l>
     <l n="87">Oh , and why should I ask myself questions ? I 've heard such before — once</l>
     <l n="88">or twice .</l>
     <l n="89">Ah , I can n't understand it — but , O , I imagine it strikes me as nice .</l>
     <l n="90">There 's a deity shapes us our ends , sir , rough-hew them , my boy , how</l>
     <l n="91">we will —</l>
     <l n="92">As I stated myself in a poem I published last year , you know , Bill —</l>
     <l n="93">Where I mentioned that that was the question — to be , or , by Jove , not</l>
     <l n="94">to be .</l>
     <l n="95">Ah , it 's something — you 'll think so hereafter — to wait on a poet like me .</l>
     <l n="96">Had I written no more than those verses on that Countess I used to</l>
     <l n="97">call Pussy —</l>
     <l n="98">Yes , Minette or Manon — and — you 'll hardly believe it — she said they</l>
     <l n="99">were all out of Musset .</l>
     <l n="100">Now I do n't say they were n't — but what then ? and I do n't say they</l>
     <l n="101">were — I 'll bet pounds against pennies on</l>
     <l n="102">The subject — I wish I may never die Laureate , if some of them were n't</l>
     <l n="103">out of Tennyson .</l>
     <l n="104">And I think — I do n't like to be certain , with Death , so to speak , by</l>
     <l n="105">me , frowning —</l>
     <l n="106">But I think there were some — say a dozen , perhaps , or a score — out of</l>
     <l n="107">Browning .</l>
     <l n="108">And — though God knows his poems are not ( as all mine are , sir ) perfumed</l>
     <l n="109">with orris —</l>
     <l n="110">Or at least with patchouli — I would n't be sworn there were none out of</l>
     <l n="111">Morris .</l>
     <l n="112">And it 's possible — only the legend of Circe is quite an old yarn — old</l>
     <l n="113">As the hills — that I might have been thinking , perhaps , of a poem by Arnold</l>
     <l n="114">When I sang how Ulysses — Odysseus I mean — would have yearned to dishevel</l>
     <l n="115">her</l>
     <l n="116">Bright hair with his kisses , and painted myself at her feet — a Strayed</l>
     <l n="117">Reveller .</l>
     <l n="118">As for poets who go on a contrary tack to what I go and you go —</l>
     <l n="119">You remember my lyrics translated — like “ sweet bully Bottom ” — from Hugo ?</l>
     <l n="120">Though I will say it 's curious that simply on just that account there</l>
     <l n="121">should be</l>
     <l n="122">Men so bold as to say that not one of my poems was written by me .</l>
     <l n="123">It would stir the political bile or the physical spleen of a drab or a Tory</l>
     <l n="124">To hear critics disputing my claim to Empedocles , Maud , and the Laboratory .</l>
     <l n="125">Yes , it 's singular — nay , I can n't think of a parallel ( ai n't it a high lark ?</l>
     <l n="126">As that Countess would say ) — there are few men believe it was I wrote the</l>

     <l n="128">And it often has given myself and Lord Albert no end of diversion</l>
     <l n="129">To hear fellows maintain to my face it was Wordsworth who wrote the</l>

     <l n="133">Turks .</l>
     <l n="134">And the pitiful critics who think in their paltry presumption to pay me a</l>

     <l n="143">Yes — I think so . And yet , on my word , I can n't think why I think it was so .</l>
     <l n="144">It more probably was in the poem I made a few seasons ago</l>
     <l n="145">On that Duchess — her name now ? ah , thus one outlives a whole cycle of joys !</l>
     <l n="146">Fair supplants black and brown succeeds golden . The poem made rather a</l>

     <l n="153">That engirdle the brows of the day when he sinks with a spasm into rest</l>
     <l n="154">And the splash of his kingly blood is dashed on the skirts of the west ,</l>
     <l n="155">Even such was my own , when I felt how much sharper than any snake 's tooth</l>
     <l n="156">Was the passion that made me mistake Lady Eve for her niece Lady Ruth .</l>
     <l n="157">The whole world , colourless , lapsed . Earth fled from my feet like a dream ,</l>
     <l n="158">And the whirl of the walls of Space was about me , and moved as a stream</l>
     <l n="159">Flowing and ebbing and flowing all night to a weary tune</l>
     <l n="160">( “ Such as that of my verses ” ? Get out ! ) in the face of a sick-souled moon .</l>
     <l n="161">The keen stars kindled and faded and fled , and the wind in my ears</l>
     <l n="162">Was the wail of a poet for failure — you need n't come snivelling tears</l>
     <l n="163">And spoiling the mixture , confound you , with dropping your tears into that !</l>
     <l n="164">I know I 'm pathetic — I must be — and you soft-hearted and fat ,</l>

     <l n="38">As they grope through the grave-yard of creeds , under skies growing</l>
     <l n="39">green at a groan for the grimness of God .</l>
     <l n="40">Blank is the book of his bounty beholden of old , and its binding is</l>
     <l n="41">blacker than bluer :</l>
     <l n="42">Out of blue into black is the scheme of the skies , and their dews</l>
     <l n="43">are the wine of the bloodshed of things ;</l>
     <l n="44">Till the darkling desire of delight shall be free as a fawn that is</l>
     <l n="45">freed from the fangs that pursue her ,</l>
     <l n="46">Till the heart-beats of hell shall be hushed by a hymn from the hunt</l>
     <l n="47">that has harried the kennel of kings .</l>
