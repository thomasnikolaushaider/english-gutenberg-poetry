     <l n="1">Over the great windy waters , and over the clear-crested summits ,</l>
     <l n="2">Unto the sun and the sky , and unto the perfecter earth ,</l>
     <l n="3">Come , let us go ,— to a land wherein gods of the old time wandered ,</l>
     <l n="4">Where every breath even now changes to ether divine .</l>
     <l n="5">Come , let us go ; though withal a voice whisper , ‘ The world that we live in ,</l>
     <l n="6">Whithersoever we turn , still is the same narrow crib ;</l>
     <l n="7">‘ Tis but to prove limitation , and measure a cord , that we travel ;</l>
     <l n="8">Let who would ‘ scape and be free go to his chamber and think ;</l>
     <l n="9">‘ Tis but to change idle fancies for memories wilfully falser ;</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="12">Dear Eustatio , I write that you may write me an answer ,</l>
     <l n="13">Or at the least to put us again en rapport with each other .</l>
     <l n="14">Rome disappoints me much ,— St Peter 's , perhaps , in especial ;</l>
     <l n="15">Only the Arch of Titus and view from the Lateran please me :</l>
     <l n="16">This , however , perhaps is the weather , which truly is horrid .</l>
     <l n="17">Greece must be better , surely ; and yet I am feeling so spiteful ,</l>
     <l n="18">That I could travel to Athens , to Delphi , and Troy , and Mount Sinai ,</l>
     <l n="19">Though but to see with my eyes that these are vanity also .</l>
     <l n="20">Rome disappoints me much ; I hardly as yet understand it , but</l>
     <l n="21">RUBBISHY seems the word that most exactly would suit it .</l>
     <l n="22">All the foolish destructions , and all the sillier savings ,</l>
     <l n="23">All the incongruous things of past incompatible ages ,</l>
     <l n="24">Seem to be treasured up here to make fools of present and future .</l>
     <l n="25">Would to Heaven the old Goths had made a cleaner sweep of it !</l>
     <l n="26">Would to Heaven some new ones would come and destroy these churches !</l>
     <l n="27">However , one can live in Rome as also in London .</l>
     <l n="28">It is a blessing , no doubt , to be rid , at least for a time , of</l>
     <l n="29">All one 's friends and relations ,— yourself ( forgive me ! ) included ,—</l>
     <l n="30">All the assujettissement of having been what one has been ,</l>
     <l n="31">What one thinks one is , or thinks that others suppose one ;</l>
     <l n="32">Yet , in despite of all , we turn like fools to the English .</l>
     <l n="33">Vernon has been my fate ; who is here the same that you knew him ,—</l>
     <l n="34">Making the tour , it seems , with friends of the name of Trevellyn .</l>

     <l n="35">II . Claude to Eustace .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="36">Rome disappoints me still ; but I shrink and adapt myself to it .</l>
     <l n="37">Somehow a tyrannous sense of a superincumbent oppression</l>
     <l n="38">Still , wherever I go , accompanies ever , and makes me</l>
     <l n="39">Feel like a tree ( shall I say ? ) buried under a ruin of brickwork .</l>
     <l n="40">Rome , believe me , my friend , is like its own Monte Testaceo ,</l>
     <l n="41">Merely a marvellous mass of broken and castaway wine-pots .</l>
     <l n="42">Ye gods ! what do I want with this rubbish of ages departed ,</l>
     <l n="43">Things that Nature abhors , the experiments that she has failed in ?</l>
     <l n="44">What do I find in the Forum ? An archway and two or three pillars .</l>
     <l n="45">Well , but St. Peter 's ? Alas , Bernini has filled it with sculpture !</l>
     <l n="46">No one can cavil , I grant , at the size of the great Coliseum .</l>
     <l n="47">Doubtless the notion of grand and capacious and massive amusement ,</l>
     <l n="48">This the old Romans had ; but tell me , is this an idea ?</l>
     <l n="49">Yet of solidity much , but of splendour little is extant :</l>
     <l n="50">‘ Brickwork I found thee , and marble I left thee ! ’ their Emperor vaunted ;</l>
     <l n="51">‘ Marble I thought thee , and brickwork I find thee ! ’ the Tourist may answer .</l>

     <l n="52">III . Georgina Trevellyn to Louisa ——.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="53">At last , dearest Louisa , I take up my pen to address you .</l>
     <l n="54">Here we are , you see , with the seven-and-seventy boxes ,</l>
     <l n="55">Courier , Papa and Mamma , the children , and Mary and Susan :</l>
     <l n="56">Here we all are at Rome , and delighted of course with St. Peter 's ,</l>
     <l n="57">And very pleasantly lodged in the famous Piazza di Spagna .</l>
     <l n="58">Rome is a wonderful place , but Mary shall tell you about it ;</l>
     <l n="59">Not very gay , however ; the English are mostly at Naples ;</l>
     <l n="60">There are the A . ' s , we hear , and most of the W. party .</l>
     <l n="61">George , however , is come ; did I tell you about his mustachios ?</l>
     <l n="62">Dear , I must really stop , for the carriage , they tell me , is waiting ;</l>
     <l n="63">Mary will finish ; and Susan is writing , they say , to Sophia .</l>
     <l n="64">Adieu , dearest Louise ,— evermore your faithful Georgina .</l>
     <l n="65">Who can a Mr. Claude be whom George has taken to be with ?</l>
     <l n="66">Very stupid , I think , but George says so VERY clever .</l>

     <l n="68">No , the Christian faith , as at any rate I understood it ,</l>
     <l n="69">With its humiliations and exaltations combining ,</l>
     <l n="70">Exaltations sublime , and yet diviner abasements ,</l>
     <l n="71">Aspirations from something most shameful here upon earth and</l>
     <l n="72">In our poor selves to something most perfect above in the heavens ,—</l>
     <l n="73">No , the Christian faith , as I , at least , understood it ,</l>
     <l n="74">Is not here , O Rome , in any of these thy churches ;</l>
     <l n="75">Is not here , but in Freiburg , or Rheims , or Westminster Abbey .</l>
     <l n="76">What in thy Dome I find , in all thy recenter efforts ,</l>
     <l n="77">Is a something , I think , more RATIONAL far , more earthly ,</l>
     <l n="78">Actual , less ideal , devout not in scorn and refusal ,</l>
     <l n="79">But in a positive , calm , Stoic-Epicurean acceptance .</l>
     <l n="80">This I begin to detect in St. Peter 's and some of the churches ,</l>
     <l n="81">Mostly in all that I see of the sixteenth-century masters ;</l>
     <l n="82">Overlaid of course with infinite gauds and gewgaws ,</l>
     <l n="83">Innocent , playful follies , the toys and trinkets of childhood ,</l>
     <l n="84">Forced on maturer years , as the serious one thing needful ,</l>
     <l n="85">By the barbarian will of the rigid and ignorant Spaniard .</l>
     <l n="86">Curious work , meantime , re-entering society : how we</l>
     <l n="87">Walk a livelong day , great Heaven , and watch our shadows !</l>
     <l n="88">What our shadows seem , forsooth , we will ourselves be .</l>
     <l n="89">Do I look like that ? you think me that : then I AM that .</l>

     <l n="91">Luther , they say , was unwise ; like a half-taught German , he could not</l>
     <l n="92">See that old follies were passing most tranquilly out of remembrance ;</l>
     <l n="93">Leo the Tenth was employing all efforts to clear out abuses ;</l>
     <l n="94">Jupiter , Juno , and Venus , Fine Arts , and Fine Letters , the Poets ,</l>
     <l n="95">Scholars , and Sculptors , and Painters , were quietly clearing away the</l>
     <l n="96">Martyrs , and Virgins , and Saints , or at any rate Thomas Aquinas :</l>
     <l n="97">He must forsooth make a fuss and distend his huge Wittenberg lungs , and</l>
     <l n="98">Bring back Theology once yet again in a flood upon Europe :</l>
     <l n="99">Lo you , for forty days from the windows of heaven it fell ; the</l>
     <l n="100">Waters prevail on the earth yet more for a hundred and fifty ;</l>
     <l n="101">Are they abating at last ? the doves that are sent to explore are</l>
     <l n="102">Wearily fain to return , at the best with a leaflet of promise ,—</l>
     <l n="103">Fain to return , as they went , to the wandering wave-tost vessel ,—</l>
     <l n="104">Fain to re-enter the roof which covers the clean and the unclean ,—</l>
     <l n="105">Luther , they say , was unwise ; he did n't see how things were going ;</l>
     <l n="106">Luther was foolish ,— but , O great God ! what call you Ignatius ?</l>
     <l n="107">O my tolerant soul , be still ! but you talk of barbarians ,</l>
     <l n="108">Alaric , Attila , Genseric ;— why , they came , they killed , they</l>
     <l n="109">Ravaged , and went on their way ; but these vile , tyrannous Spaniards ,</l>
     <l n="110">These are here still ,— how long , O ye heavens , in the country of Dante ?</l>
     <l n="111">These , that fanaticized Europe , which now can forget them , release not</l>
     <l n="112">This , their choicest of prey , this Italy ; here you see them ,—</l>
     <l n="113">Here , with emasculate pupils and gimcrack churches of Gesu ,</l>
     <l n="114">Pseudo-learning and lies , confessional-boxes and postures ,—</l>
     <l n="115">Here , with metallic beliefs and regimental devotions ,—</l>
     <l n="116">Here , overcrusting with slime , perverting , defacing , debasing ,</l>
     <l n="117">Michael Angelo 's Dome , that had hung the Pantheon in heaven ,</l>
     <l n="118">Raphael 's Joys and Graces , and thy clear stars , Galileo !</l>

     <l n="120">Which of three Misses Trevellyn it is that Vernon shall marry</l>
     <l n="121">Is not a thing to be known ; for our friend is one of those natures</l>
     <l n="122">Which have their perfect delight in the general tender-domestic ,</l>
     <l n="123">So that he trifles with Mary 's shawl , ties Susan 's bonnet ,</l>
     <l n="124">Dances with all , but at home is most , they say , with Georgina ,</l>
     <l n="125">Who is , however , TOO silly in my apprehension for Vernon .</l>
     <l n="126">I , as before when I wrote , continue to see them a little ;</l>
     <l n="127">Not that I like them much or care a bajocco for Vernon ,</l>
     <l n="128">But I am slow at Italian , have not many English acquaintance ,</l>

     <l n="135">Doubtless somewhere in some neighbourhood have , and are careful to keep , some</l>

     <l n="141">Ah , what a shame , indeed , to abuse these most worthy people !</l>
     <l n="142">Ah , what a sin to have sneered at their innocent rustic pretensions !</l>
     <l n="143">Is it not laudable really , this reverent worship of station ?</l>
     <l n="144">Is it not fitting that wealth should tender this homage to culture ?</l>
     <l n="145">Is it not touching to witness these efforts , if little availing ,</l>
     <l n="146">Painfully made , to perform the old ritual service of manners ?</l>

     <l n="410">Not understanding , however , but thinking mostly of Murray ,</l>
     <l n="411">And , for to-day is their day , of the Campidoglio Marbles ;</l>
     <l n="412">Caffe-latte ! I call to the waiter ,— and Non c'e latte ,</l>
     <l n="413">This is the answer he makes me , and this is the sign of a battle .</l>
     <l n="414">So I sit : and truly they seem to think any one else more</l>
     <l n="415">Worthy than me of attention . I wait for my milkless nero ,</l>
     <l n="416">Free to observe undistracted all sorts and sizes of persons ,</l>
     <l n="417">Blending civilian and soldier in strangest costume , coming in , and</l>
     <l n="418">Gulping in hottest haste , still standing , their coffee ,— withdrawing</l>
     <l n="419">Eagerly , jangling a sword on the steps , or jogging a musket</l>
     <l n="420">Slung to the shoulder behind . They are fewer , moreover , than usual ,</l>
     <l n="421">Much and silenter far ; and so I begin to imagine</l>
     <l n="422">Something is really afloat . Ere I leave , the Caffe is empty ,</l>
     <l n="423">Empty too the streets , in all its length the Corso</l>
     <l n="424">Empty , and empty I see to my right and left the Condotti .</l>
     <l n="425">Twelve o'clock , on the Pincian Hill , with lots of English ,</l>
     <l n="426">Germans , Americans , French ,— the Frenchmen , too , are protected ,—</l>

     <l n="429">Smoke , from the cannon , white ,— but that is at intervals only ,—</l>
     <l n="430">Black , from a burning house , we suppose , by the Cavalleggieri ;</l>
     <l n="431">And we believe we discern some lines of men descending</l>
     <l n="432">Down through the vineyard-slopes , and catch a bayonet gleaming .</l>
     <l n="433">Every ten minutes , however ,— in this there is no misconception ,—</l>
     <l n="434">Comes a great white puff from behind Michel Angelo 's dome , and</l>
     <l n="435">After a space the report of a real big gun ,— not the Frenchman 's !—</l>
     <l n="436">That must be doing some work . And so we watch and conjecture .</l>
     <l n="437">Shortly , an Englishman comes , who says he has been to St. Peter 's ,</l>
     <l n="438">Seen the Piazza and troops , but that is all he can tell us ;</l>
     <l n="439">So we watch and sit , and , indeed , it begins to be tiresome .—</l>
     <l n="440">All this smoke is outside ; when it has come to the inside ,</l>
     <l n="441">It will be time , perhaps , to descend and retreat to our houses .</l>
     <l n="442">Half-past one , or two . The report of small arms frequent ,</l>
     <l n="443">Sharp and savage indeed ; that cannot all be for nothing :</l>
     <l n="444">So we watch and wonder ; but guessing is tiresome , very .</l>
     <l n="445">Weary of wondering , watching , and guessing , and gossiping idly ,</l>
     <l n="446">Down I go , and pass through the quiet streets with the knots of</l>
     <l n="447">National Guards patrolling , and flags hanging out at the windows ,</l>
     <l n="448">English , American , Danish ,— and , after offering to help an</l>
     <l n="449">Irish family moving en masse to the Maison Serny ,</l>
     <l n="450">After endeavouring idly to minister balm to the trembling</l>
     <l n="451">Quinquagenarian fears of two lone British spinsters ,</l>
     <l n="452">Go to make sure of my dinner before the enemy enter .</l>

     <l n="481">I was returning home from St. Peter 's ; Murray , as usual ,</l>

     <l n="489">Heading a crowd , it is plain , that is coming behind that corner .</l>
     <l n="490">Looking up , I see windows filled with heads ; the Piazza ,</l>
     <l n="491">Into which you remember the Ponte St. Angelo enters ,</l>
     <l n="492">Since I passed , has thickened with curious groups ; and now the</l>

     <l n="494">Here at my side . In the middle they drag at something . What is it ?</l>
     <l n="495">Ha ! bare swords in the air , held up ? There seem to be voices</l>
     <l n="496">Pleading and hands putting back ; official , perhaps ; but the swords are</l>
     <l n="497">Many , and bare in the air . In the air ? they descend ; they are smiting ,</l>
     <l n="498">Hewing , chopping — At what ? In the air once more upstretched ? And —</l>
     <l n="499">Is it blood that 's on them ? Yes , certainly blood ! Of whom , then ?</l>
     <l n="500">Over whom is the cry of this furor of exultation ?</l>
     <l n="501">While they are skipping and screaming , and dancing their caps on the points of</l>

     <l n="504">That way , makes me answer , ‘ A Priest , who was trying to fly to</l>

     <l n="159">She that should love him must look for small love in return ,— like the ivy</l>

   <p>P. S . ( 2 ) Ah , my dearest Miss Roper , do just as you fancy about it . If you think it sincerer to tell him I know of it , do so . Though I should most extremely dislike it , I know I could manage . It is the simplest thing , but surely wholly uncalled for . Do as you please ; you know I trust implicitly to you . Say whatever is right and needful for ending the matter . Only do n't tell Mr. Claude , what I will tell you as a secret , That I should like very well to show him myself I forget it .</p>
   <p>P. S . ( 3 ) I am to say that the wedding is finally settled for Tuesday . Ah , my dear Miss Roper , you surely , surely can manage Not to let it appear that I know of that odious matter . It would be pleasanter far for myself to treat it exactly As if it had not occurred : and I do not think he would like it . I must remember to add , that as soon as the wedding is over We shall be off , I believe , in a hurry , and travel to Milan ; There to meet friends of Papa 's , I am told , at the Croce di Malta Then I cannot say whither , but not at present to England .</p>

     <l n="12">Under those vulgar eyes , the observed of such observers !</l>
     <l n="13">Well , but I now , by a series of fine diplomatic inquiries ,</l>

     <l n="15">Who is remaining at Rome with a brother too ill for removal ,</l>
