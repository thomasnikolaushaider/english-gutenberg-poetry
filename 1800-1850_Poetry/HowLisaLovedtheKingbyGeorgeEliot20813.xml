   <p>How Lisa loved the King .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Six hundred years ago , in Dante 's time ,</l>
     <l n="2">Before his cheek was furrowed by deep rhyme ;</l>
     <l n="3">When Europe , fed afresh from Eastern story ,</l>
     <l n="4">Was like a garden tangled with the glory</l>
     <l n="5">Of flowers hand-planted and of flowers air-sown ,</l>
     <l n="6">Climbing and trailing , budding and full-blown ,</l>
     <l n="7">Where purple bells are tossed amid pink stars ,</l>
     <l n="8">And springing blades , green troops in innocent wars ,</l>
     <l n="9">Crowd every shady spot of teeming earth ,</l>
     <l n="10">Making invisible motion visible birth ,—</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="11">Six hundred years ago , Palermo town</l>
     <l n="12">Kept holiday . A deed of great renown ,</l>
     <l n="13">A high revenge , had freed it from the yoke</l>
     <l n="14">Of hated Frenchmen ; and from Calpe 's rock</l>
     <l n="15">To where the Bosporus caught the earlier sun ,</l>
     <l n="16">‘ Twas told that Pedro , King of Aragon ,</l>
     <l n="17">Was welcomed master of all Sicily ,—</l>
     <l n="18">A royal knight , supreme as kings should be</l>
     <l n="19">In strength and gentleness that make high chivalry .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="20">Spain was the favorite home of knightly grace ,</l>
     <l n="21">Where generous men rode steeds of generous race ;</l>
     <l n="22">Both Spanish , yet half Arab ; both inspired</l>
     <l n="23">By mutual spirit , that each motion fired</l>
     <l n="24">With beauteous response , like minstrelsy</l>
     <l n="25">Afresh fulfilling fresh expectancy .</l>
     <l n="26">So , when Palermo made high festival ,</l>
     <l n="27">The joy of matrons and of maidens all</l>
     <l n="28">Was the mock terror of the tournament ,</l>
     <l n="29">Where safety , with the glimpse of danger blent ,</l>
     <l n="30">Took exaltation as from epic song ,</l>
     <l n="31">Which greatly tells the pains that to great life belong .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="32">And in all eyes King Pedro was the king</l>
     <l n="33">Of cavaliers ; as in a full-gemmed ring</l>
     <l n="34">The largest ruby , or as that bright star</l>
     <l n="35">Whose shining shows us where the Hyads are .</l>
     <l n="36">His the best genet , and he sat it best ;</l>
     <l n="37">His weapon , whether tilting or in rest ,</l>
     <l n="38">Was worthiest watching ; and his face , once seen ,</l>
     <l n="39">Gave to the promise of his royal mien</l>
     <l n="40">Such rich fulfilment as the opened eyes</l>
     <l n="41">Of a loved sleeper , or the long-watched rise</l>
     <l n="42">Of vernal day , whose joy o'er stream and meadow flies .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="43">But of the maiden forms that thick enwreathed</l>
     <l n="44">The broad piazza , and sweet witchery breathed ,</l>
     <l n="45">With innocent faces budding all arow ,</l>
     <l n="46">From balconies and windows high and low ,</l>
     <l n="47">Who was it felt the deep mysterious glow ,</l>
     <l n="48">The impregnation with supernal fire</l>
     <l n="49">Of young ideal love , transformed desire ,</l>
     <l n="50">Whose passion is but worship of that Best</l>
     <l n="51">Taught by the many-mingled creed of each young breast ?</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="52">{ Lady walking through garden : p10. jpg }</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="53">‘ Twas gentle Lisa , of no noble line ,</l>
     <l n="54">Child of Bernardo , a rich Florentine ,</l>
     <l n="55">Who from his merchant-city hither came</l>
     <l n="56">To trade in drugs ; yet kept an honest fame ,</l>
     <l n="57">And had the virtue not to try and sell</l>
     <l n="58">Drugs that had none . He loved his riches well ,</l>
     <l n="59">But loved them chiefly for his Lisa 's sake ,</l>
     <l n="60">Whom with a father 's care he sought to make</l>
     <l n="61">The bride of some true honorable man ,—</l>
     <l n="62">Of Perdicone ( so the rumor ran ) ,</l>
     <l n="63">Whose birth was higher than his fortunes were ,</l>
     <l n="64">For still your trader likes a mixture fair</l>
     <l n="65">Of blood that hurries to some higher strain</l>
     <l n="66">Than reckoning money 's loss and money 's gain .</l>
     <l n="67">And of such mixture good may surely come :</l>
     <l n="68">Lord 's scions so may learn to cast a sum ,</l>
     <l n="69">A trader 's grandson bear a well-set head ,</l>
     <l n="70">And have less conscious manners , better bred ;</l>
     <l n="71">Nor , when he tries to be polite , be rude instead .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="72">‘ Twas Perdicone 's friends made overtures</l>
     <l n="73">To good Bernardo ; so one dame assures</l>
     <l n="74">Her neighbor dame , who notices the youth</l>
     <l n="75">Fixing his eyes on Lisa ; and , in truth ,</l>
     <l n="76">Eyes that could see her on this summer day</l>
     <l n="77">Might find it hard to turn another way .</l>
     <l n="78">She had a pensive beauty , yet not sad ;</l>
     <l n="79">Rather like minor cadences that glad</l>
     <l n="80">The hearts of little birds amid spring boughs :</l>
     <l n="81">And oft the trumpet or the joust would rouse</l>
     <l n="82">Pulses that gave her cheek a finer glow ,</l>
     <l n="83">Parting her lips that seemed a mimic bow</l>
     <l n="84">By chiselling Love for play in coral wrought ,</l>
     <l n="85">Then quickened by him with the passionate thought ,</l>
     <l n="86">The soul that trembled in the lustrous night</l>
     <l n="87">Of slow long eyes . Her body was so slight ,</l>
     <l n="88">It seemed she could have floated in the sky ,</l>
     <l n="89">And with the angelic choir made symphony ;</l>
     <l n="90">But in her cheek 's rich tinge , and in the dark</l>
     <l n="91">Of darkest hair and eyes , she bore a mark</l>
     <l n="92">Of kinship to her generous mother-earth ,</l>
     <l n="93">The fervid land that gives the plumy palm-trees birth .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="94">She saw not Perdicone ; her young mind</l>
     <l n="95">Dreamed not that any man had ever pined</l>
     <l n="96">For such a little simple maid as she :</l>
     <l n="97">She had but dreamed how heavenly it would be</l>
     <l n="98">To love some hero noble , beauteous , great ,</l>
     <l n="99">Who would live stories worthy to narrate ,</l>
     <l n="100">Like Roland , or the warriors of Troy ,</l>
     <l n="101">The Cid , or Amadis , or that fair boy</l>
     <l n="102">Who conquered every thing beneath the sun ,</l>
     <l n="103">And somehow , some time , died at Babylon</l>
     <l n="104">Fighting the Moors . For heroes all were good</l>
     <l n="105">And fair as that archangel who withstood</l>
     <l n="106">The Evil One , the author of all wrong ,—</l>
     <l n="107">That Evil One who made the French so strong ;</l>
     <l n="108">And now the flower of heroes must he be</l>
     <l n="109">Who drove those tyrants from dear Sicily ,</l>
     <l n="110">So that her maids might walk to vespers tranquilly .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="111">Young Lisa saw this hero in the king ;</l>
     <l n="112">And as wood-lilies that sweet odors bring</l>
     <l n="113">Might dream the light that opes their modest eyne</l>
     <l n="114">Was lily-odored ; and as rites divine ,</l>
     <l n="115">Round turf-laid altars , or ‘ neath roofs of stone ,</l>
     <l n="116">Draw sanctity from out the heart alone</l>
     <l n="117">That loves and worships : so the miniature</l>
     <l n="118">Perplexed of her soul 's world , all virgin pure ,</l>
     <l n="119">Filled with heroic virtues that bright form ,</l>
     <l n="120">Raona 's royalty , the finished norm</l>
     <l n="121">Of horsemanship , the half of chivalry ;</l>
     <l n="122">For how could generous men avengers be ,</l>
     <l n="123">Save as God 's messengers on coursers fleet ?—</l>
     <l n="124">These , scouring earth , made Spain with Syria meet</l>
     <l n="125">In one self-world where the same right had sway ,</l>
     <l n="126">And good must grow as grew the blessed day .</l>
     <l n="127">No more : great Love his essence had endued</l>
     <l n="128">With Pedro 's form , and , entering , subdued</l>
     <l n="129">The soul of Lisa , fervid and intense ,</l>
     <l n="130">Proud in its choice of proud obedience</l>
     <l n="131">To hardship glorified by perfect reverence .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="132">Sweet Lisa homeward carried that dire guest ,</l>
     <l n="133">And in her chamber , through the hours of rest ,</l>
     <l n="134">The darkness was alight for her with sheen</l>
     <l n="135">Of arms , and plumed helm ; and bright between</l>
     <l n="136">Their commoner gloss , like the pure living spring</l>
     <l n="137">‘ Twixt porphyry lips , or living bird 's bright wing</l>
     <l n="138">‘ Twixt golden wires , the glances of the king</l>
     <l n="139">Flashed on her soul , and waked vibrations there</l>
     <l n="140">Of known delights love-mixed to new and rare :</l>
     <l n="141">The impalpable dream was turned to breathing flesh ,</l>
     <l n="142">Chill thought of summer to the warm close mesh</l>
     <l n="143">Of sunbeams held between the citron-leaves ,</l>
     <l n="144">Clothing her life of life . Oh ! she believes</l>
     <l n="145">That she could be content if he but knew</l>
     <l n="146">( Her poor small self could claim no other due )</l>
     <l n="147">How Lisa 's lowly love had highest reach</l>
     <l n="148">Of winged passion , whereto winged speech</l>
     <l n="149">Would be scorched remnants left by mounting flame .</l>
     <l n="150">Though , had she such lame message , were it blame</l>
     <l n="151">To tell what greatness dwelt in her , what rank</l>
     <l n="152">She held in loving ? Modest maidens shrank</l>
     <l n="153">From telling love that fed on selfish hope ;</l>
     <l n="154">But love , as hopeless as the shattering song ,</l>
     <l n="155">Wailed for loved beings who have joined the throng</l>
     <l n="156">Of mighty dead ones . . . . Nay , but she was weak ,</l>
     <l n="157">Knew only prayers and ballads , could not speak</l>
     <l n="158">With eloquence , save what dumb creatures have ,</l>
     <l n="159">That with small cries and touches small boons crave .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="160">She watched all day that she might see him pass</l>
     <l n="161">With knights and ladies ; but she said , “ Alas !</l>
     <l n="162">Though he should see me , it were all as one</l>
     <l n="163">He saw a pigeon sitting on the stone</l>
     <l n="164">Of wall or balcony : some colored spot</l>
     <l n="165">His eye just sees , his mind regardeth not .</l>
     <l n="166">I have no music-touch that could bring nigh</l>
     <l n="167">My love to his soul 's hearing . I shall die ,</l>
     <l n="168">And he will never know who Lisa was ,—</l>
     <l n="169">The trader 's child , whose soaring spirit rose</l>
     <l n="170">As hedge-born aloe-flowers that rarest years disclose .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="171">{ Lady seated overlooking garden : p18. jpg }</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="172">“ For were I now a fair deep-breasted queen</l>
     <l n="173">A-horseback , with blonde hair , and tunic green ,</l>
     <l n="174">Gold-bordered , like Costanza , I should need</l>
     <l n="175">No change within to make me queenly there :</l>
     <l n="176">For they the royal-hearted women are</l>
     <l n="177">Who nobly love the noblest , yet have grace ;</l>
     <l n="178">For needy suffering lives in lowliest place ,</l>
     <l n="179">Carrying a choicer sunlight in their smile ,</l>
     <l n="180">The heavenliest ray that pitieth the vile .</l>
     <l n="181">My love is such , it cannot choose but soar</l>
     <l n="182">Up to the highest ; yet forevermore ,</l>
     <l n="183">Though I were happy , throned beside the king ,</l>
     <l n="184">I should be tender to each little thing</l>
     <l n="185">With hurt warm breast , that had no speech to tell</l>
     <l n="186">Its inward pang ; and I would soothe it well</l>
     <l n="187">With tender touch , and with a low soft moan</l>
     <l n="188">For company : my dumb love-pang is lone ,</l>
     <l n="189">Prisoned as topaz-beam within a rough-garbed stone . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="190">So , inward-wailing , Lisa passed her days .</l>
     <l n="191">Each night the August moon with changing phase</l>
     <l n="192">Looked broader , harder , on her unchanged pain ;</l>
     <l n="193">Each noon the heat lay heavier again</l>
     <l n="194">On her despair , until her body frail</l>
     <l n="195">Shrank like the snow that watchers in the vale</l>
     <l n="196">See narrowed on the height each summer morn ;</l>
     <l n="197">While her dark glance burnt larger , more forlorn ,</l>
     <l n="198">As if the soul within her , all on fire ,</l>
     <l n="199">Made of her being one swift funeral-pyre .</l>
     <l n="200">Father and mother saw with sad dismay</l>
     <l n="201">The meaning of their riches melt away ;</l>
     <l n="202">For without Lisa what would sequins buy ?</l>
     <l n="203">What wish were left if Lisa were to die ?</l>
     <l n="204">Through her they cared for summers still to come ,</l>
     <l n="205">Else they would be as ghosts without a home</l>
     <l n="206">In any flesh that could feel glad desire .</l>
     <l n="207">They pay the best physicians , never tire</l>
     <l n="208">Of seeking what will soothe her , promising</l>
     <l n="209">That aught she longed for , though it were a thing</l>
     <l n="210">Hard to be come at as the Indian snow ,</l>
     <l n="211">Or roses that on Alpine summits blow ,</l>
     <l n="212">It should be hers . She answers with low voice ,</l>
     <l n="213">She longs for death alone — death is her choice ;</l>
     <l n="214">Death is the king who never did think scorn ,</l>
     <l n="215">But rescues every meanest soul to sorrow born .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="216">Yet one day , as they bent above her bed ,</l>
     <l n="217">And watched her in brief sleep , her drooping head</l>
     <l n="218">Turned gently , as the thirsty flowers that feel</l>
     <l n="219">Some moist revival through their petals steal ;</l>
     <l n="220">And little flutterings of her lids and lips</l>
     <l n="221">Told of such dreamy joy as sometimes dips</l>
     <l n="222">A skyey shadow in the mind 's poor pool .</l>
     <l n="223">She oped her eyes , and turned their dark gems full</l>
     <l n="224">Upon her father , as in utterance dumb</l>
     <l n="225">Of some new prayer that in her sleep had come .</l>
     <l n="226">“ What is it , Lisa ? ” — “ Father , I would see</l>
     <l n="227">Minuccio , the great singer ; bring him me . ”</l>
     <l n="228">For always , night and day , her unstilled thought ,</l>
     <l n="229">Wandering all o'er its little world , had sought</l>
     <l n="230">How she could reach , by some soft pleading touch ,</l>
     <l n="231">King Pedro 's soul , that she who loved so much ,</l>
     <l n="232">Dying , might have a place within his mind ,—</l>
     <l n="233">A little grave which he would sometimes find</l>
     <l n="234">And plant some flower on it ,— some thought , some memory kind .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="235">Till in her dream she saw Minuccio</l>
     <l n="236">Touching his viola , and chanting low</l>
     <l n="237">A strain , that , falling on her brokenly ,</l>
     <l n="238">Seemed blossoms lightly blown from off a tree ;</l>
     <l n="239">Each burthened with a word that was a scent ,—</l>
     <l n="240">Raona , Lisa , love , death , tournament ;</l>
     <l n="241">Then in her dream she said , “ He sings of me ,</l>
     <l n="242">Might be my messenger ; ah ! now I see</l>
     <l n="243">The king is listening ” — Then she awoke ,</l>
     <l n="244">And , missing her dear dream , that new-born longing spoke .</l>
     <l n="245">She longed for music : that was natural ;</l>
     <l n="246">Physicians said it was medicinal ;</l>

     <l n="536">Their gladness at his daughter 's happier state ,</l>
     <l n="537">Which they were fain to see . Soon came the king</l>
     <l n="538">On horseback , with his barons , heralding</l>
     <l n="539">The advent of the queen in courtly state ;</l>
     <l n="540">And all , descending at the garden gate ,</l>
     <l n="541">Streamed with their feathers , velvet , and brocade ,</l>
     <l n="542">Through the pleached alleys , till they , pausing , made</l>
     <l n="543">A lake of splendor ‘ mid the aloes gray ;</l>
     <l n="544">When , meekly facing all their proud array ,</l>
     <l n="545">The white-robed Lisa with her parents stood ,</l>
     <l n="546">As some white dove before the gorgeous brood</l>
     <l n="547">Of dapple-breasted birds born by the Colchian flood .</l>
     <l n="548">The king and queen , by gracious looks and speech ,</l>
     <l n="549">Encourage her , and thus their courtiers teach</l>
     <l n="550">How , this fair morning , they may courtliest be ,</l>
     <l n="551">By making Lisa pass it happily .</l>
     <l n="552">And soon the ladies and the barons all</l>
     <l n="553">Draw her by turns , as at a festival</l>
     <l n="554">Made for her sake , to easy , gay discourse ,</l>
     <l n="555">And compliment with looks and smiles enforce ;</l>
     <l n="556">A joyous hum is heard the gardens round ;</l>
     <l n="557">Soon there is Spanish dancing , and the sound</l>
     <l n="558">Of minstrel 's song , and autumn fruits are pluckt ;</l>
     <l n="559">Till mindfully the king and queen conduct</l>
     <l n="560">Lisa apart to where a trellised shade</l>
     <l n="561">Made pleasant resting . Then King Pedro said ,—</l>
     <l n="562">“ Excellent maiden , that rich gift of love</l>
     <l n="563">Your heart hath made us hath a worth above</l>
     <l n="564">All royal treasures , nor is fitly met</l>
     <l n="565">Save when the grateful memory of deep debt</l>
     <l n="566">Lies still behind the outward honors done :</l>
     <l n="567">And as a sign that no oblivion</l>
     <l n="568">Shall overflood that faithful memory ,</l>
     <l n="569">We while we live your cavalier will be ;</l>
     <l n="570">Nor will we ever arm ourselves for fight ,</l>
     <l n="571">Whether for struggle dire , or brief delight</l>
     <l n="572">Of warlike feigning , but we first will take</l>
     <l n="573">The colors you ordain , and for your sake</l>
     <l n="574">Charge the more bravely where your emblem is :</l>
     <l n="575">Nor will we claim from you an added bliss</l>
     <l n="576">To our sweet thoughts of you save one sole kiss .</l>
     <l n="577">But there still rests the outward honor meet</l>
     <l n="578">To mark your worthiness ; and we entreat</l>
     <l n="579">That you will turn your ear to proffered vows</l>
     <l n="580">Of one who loves you , and would be your spouse</l>
     <l n="581">We must not wrong yourself and Sicily</l>
     <l n="582">By letting all your blooming years pass by</l>
     <l n="583">Unmated : you will give the world its due</l>
     <l n="584">From beauteous maiden , and become a matron true . ”</l>

     <l n="586">Then Lisa , wrapt in virgin wonderment</l>
     <l n="587">At her ambitious love 's complete content ,</l>
     <l n="588">Which left no further good for her to seek</l>
     <l n="589">Than love 's obedience , said , with accent meek ,—</l>
     <l n="590">“ Monsignor , I know well that were it known</l>
     <l n="591">To all the world how high my love had flown ,</l>
     <l n="592">There would be few who would not deem me mad ,</l>
     <l n="593">Or say my mind the falsest image had</l>
     <l n="594">Of my condition and your loftiness .</l>
     <l n="595">But Heaven has seen that for no moment 's space</l>
     <l n="596">Have I forgotten you to be the king ,</l>
     <l n="597">Or me myself to be a lowly thing —</l>
     <l n="598">A little lark , enamoured of the sky ,</l>
     <l n="599">That soared to sing , to break its breast , and die .</l>
     <l n="600">But , as you better know than I , the heart</l>
     <l n="601">In choosing chooseth not its own desert ,</l>
     <l n="602">But that great merit which attracteth it :</l>
     <l n="603">‘ Tis law , I struggled , but I must submit ,</l>
     <l n="604">And having seen a worth all worth above ,</l>
     <l n="605">I loved you , love you , and shall always love .</l>
     <l n="606">But that doth mean , my will is ever yours ,</l>
     <l n="607">Not only when your will my good insures ,</l>
     <l n="608">But if it wrought me what the world calls harm :</l>
     <l n="609">Fire , wounds , would wear from your dear will a charm .</l>
     <l n="610">That you will be my knight is full content ,</l>
     <l n="611">And for that kiss ,— I pray , first , for the queen 's consent . ”</l>
     <l n="612">Her answer , given with such firm gentleness ,</l>
     <l n="613">Pleased the queen well , and made her hold no less</l>
     <l n="614">Of Lisa 's merit than the king had held .</l>
     <l n="615">And so , all cloudy threats of grief dispelled ,</l>
     <l n="616">There was betrothal made that very morn</l>
     <l n="617">‘ Twixt Perdicone , youthful , brave , well-born ,</l>
     <l n="618">And Lisa whom he loved ; she loving well</l>
     <l n="619">The lot that from obedience befell .</l>
     <l n="620">The queen a rare betrothal ring on each</l>
     <l n="621">Bestowed , and other gems , with gracious speech .</l>
     <l n="622">And , that no joy might lack , the king , who knew</l>
     <l n="623">The youth was poor , gave him rich Ceffalu</l>
     <l n="624">And Cataletta ,— large and fruitful lands ,—</l>
     <l n="625">Adding much promise when he joined their hands .</l>
     <l n="626">At last he said to Lisa , with an air</l>
     <l n="627">Gallant yet noble , “ Now we claim our share</l>
     <l n="628">From your sweet love , a share which is not small ;</l>
     <l n="629">For in the sacrament one crumb is all . ”</l>
     <l n="630">Then , taking her small face his hands between ,</l>
     <l n="631">He kissed her on the brow with kiss serene ,—</l>
     <l n="632">Fit seal to that pure vision her young soul had seen .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="36">
     <l n="633">And many witnessed that King Pedro kept</l>
     <l n="634">His royal promise . Perdicone stept</l>
     <l n="635">To many honors honorably won ,</l>
     <l n="636">Living with Lisa in true union .</l>
     <l n="637">Throughout his life , the king still took delight</l>
     <l n="638">To call himself fair Lisa 's faithful knight ;</l>
     <l n="639">And never wore in field or tournament</l>
     <l n="640">A scarf or emblem , save by Lisa sent .</l>
     <l n="641">Such deeds made subjects loyal in that land ;</l>
     <l n="642">They joyed that one so worthy to command ,</l>
     <l n="643">So chivalrous and gentle , had become</l>
     <l n="644">The king of Sicily , and filled the room</l>
     <l n="645">Of Frenchmen , who abused the Church 's trust ,</l>
     <l n="646">Till , in a righteous vengeance on their lust ,</l>
     <l n="647">Messina rose , with God , and with the dagger 's thrust .</l>
