    <docDate><date>1864</date>. To My Father . I . Take of the first fruits , Father , of thy care , Wrapped in the fresh leaves of my gratitude Late waked for early gifts ill understood ; Claiming in all my harvests rightful share , Whether with song that mounts the joyful air I praise my God ; or , in yet deeper mood , Sit dumb because I know a speechless good , Needing no voice , but all the soul for prayer . Thou hast been faithful to my highest need ; And I , thy debtor , ever , evermore , Shall never feel the grateful burden sore . Yet most I thank thee , not for any deed , But for the sense thy living self did breed That fatherhood is at the great world 's core . II . All childhood , reverence clothed thee , undefined , As for some being of another race ; Ah ! not with it departing — grown apace As years have brought me manhood 's loftier mind Able to see thy human life behind — The same hid heart , the same revealing face — My own dim contest settling into grace Of sorrow , strife , and victory combined . So I beheld my God , in childhood 's morn , A mist , a darkness , great , and far apart , Moveless and dim — I scarce could say Thou art : My manhood came , of joy and sadness born — Full soon the misty dark , asunder torn , Revealed man 's glory , God 's great human heart .

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Proudly the youth , by manhood sudden crowned ,</l>
     <l n="2">Went walking by his horses to the plough ,</l>
     <l n="3">For the first time that morn . No soldier gay</l>
     <l n="4">Feels at his side the throb of the gold hilt</l>
     <l n="5">( Knowing the blue blade hides within its sheath ,</l>
     <l n="6">As lightning in the cloud ) with more delight ,</l>
     <l n="7">When first he belts it on , than he that day</l>
     <l n="8">Heard still the clank of the plough-chains against</l>
     <l n="9">The horses ’ harnessed sides , as to the field</l>
     <l n="10">They went to make it fruitful . O'er the hill</l>
     <l n="11">The sun looked down , baptizing him for toil .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="12">A farmer 's son he was , and grandson too ;</l>
     <l n="13">Yea , his great-grandsire had possessed these fields .</l>
     <l n="14">Tradition said they had been tilled by men</l>
     <l n="15">Who bore the name long centuries ago ,</l>
     <l n="16">And married wives , and reared a stalwart race ,</l>
     <l n="17">And died , and went where all had followed them ,</l>
     <l n="18">Save one old man , his daughter , and the youth</l>
     <l n="19">Who ploughs in pride , nor ever doubts his toil ;</l>
     <l n="20">And death is far from him this sunny morn .</l>
     <l n="21">Why should we think of death when life is high ?</l>
     <l n="22">The earth laughs all the day , and sleeps all night .</l>
     <l n="23">Earth , give us food , and , after that , a grave ;</l>
     <l n="24">For both are good , each better in its time .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="25">The youth knew little ; but he read old tales</l>
     <l n="26">Of Scotland 's warriors , till his blood ran swift</l>
     <l n="27">As charging knights upon their death career .</l>
     <l n="28">And then he chanted old tunes , till the blood</l>
     <l n="29">Was charmed back into its fountain-well ,</l>
     <l n="30">And tears arose instead . And Robert 's songs ,</l>
     <l n="31">Which ever flow in noises like his name ,</l>
     <l n="32">Rose from him in the fields beside the kine ,</l>
     <l n="33">And met the sky-lark 's rain from out the clouds .</l>
     <l n="34">As yet he sang only as sing the birds ,</l>
     <l n="35">From gladness simply , or , he knew not why .</l>
     <l n="36">The earth was fair — he knew not it was fair ;</l>
     <l n="37">And he so glad — he knew not he was glad :</l>
     <l n="38">He walked as in a twilight of the sense ,</l>
     <l n="39">Which this one day shall turn to tender light .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="40">For , ere the sun had cleared the feathery tops</l>
     <l n="41">Of the fir-thicket on the eastward hill ,</l>
     <l n="42">His horses leaned and laboured . His great hands</l>
     <l n="43">Held both the reins and plough-stilts : he was proud ;</l>
     <l n="44">Proud with a ploughman 's pride ; nobler , may be ,</l>
     <l n="45">Than statesman 's , ay , or poet 's pride sometimes ,</l>
     <l n="46">For little praise would come that he ploughed well ,</l>
     <l n="47">And yet he did it well ; proud of his work ,</l>
     <l n="48">And not of what would follow . With sure eye ,</l>
     <l n="49">He saw the horses keep the arrow-track ;</l>
     <l n="50">He saw the swift share cut the measured sod ;</l>
     <l n="51">He saw the furrow folding to the right ,</l>
     <l n="52">Ready with nimble foot to aid at need .</l>
     <l n="53">And there the slain sod lay , patient for grain ,</l>
     <l n="54">Turning its secrets upward to the sun ,</l>
     <l n="55">And hiding in a grave green sun-born grass ,</l>
     <l n="56">And daisies clipped in carmine : all must die ,</l>
     <l n="57">That others live , and they arise again .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="58">Then when the sun had clomb to his decline ,</l>
     <l n="59">And seemed to rest , before his slow descent ,</l>
     <l n="60">Upon the keystone of his airy bridge ,</l>
     <l n="61">They rested likewise , half-tired man and horse ,</l>
     <l n="62">And homeward went for food and courage new ;</l>
     <l n="63">Whereby refreshed , they turned again to toil ,</l>
     <l n="64">And lived in labour all the afternoon .</l>
     <l n="65">Till , in the gloaming , once again the plough</l>
     <l n="66">Lay like a stranded bark upon the lea ;</l>
     <l n="67">And home with hanging neck the horses went ,</l>
     <l n="68">Walking beside their master , force by will .</l>
     <l n="69">Then through the deepening shades a vision came .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="70">It was a lady mounted on a horse ,</l>
     <l n="71">A slender girl upon a mighty steed ,</l>
     <l n="72">That bore her with the pride horses must feel</l>
     <l n="73">When they submit to women . Home she went ,</l>
     <l n="74">Alone , or else the groom lagged far behind .</l>
     <l n="75">But , as she passed , some faithless belt gave way ;</l>
     <l n="76">The saddle slipped , the horse stopped , and the girl</l>
     <l n="77">Stood on her feet , still holding fast the reins .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="78">Three paces bore him bounding to her side ;</l>
     <l n="79">Her radiant beauty almost fixed him there ;</l>
     <l n="80">But with main force , as one that gripes with fear ,</l>
     <l n="81">He threw the fascination off , and saw</l>
     <l n="82">The work before him . Soon his hand and knife</l>
     <l n="83">Replaced the saddle firmer than before</l>
     <l n="84">Upon the gentle horse ; and then he turned</l>
     <l n="85">To mount the maiden . But bewilderment</l>
     <l n="86">A moment lasted ; for he knew not how ,</l>
     <l n="87">With stirrup-hand and steady arm , to throne ,</l>
     <l n="88">Elastic , on her steed , the ascending maid :</l>
     <l n="89">A moment only ; for while yet she thanked ,</l>
     <l n="90">Nor yet had time to teach her further will ,</l>
     <l n="91">Around her waist he put his brawny hands ,</l>
     <l n="92">That almost zoned her round ; and like a child</l>
     <l n="93">Lifting her high , he set her on the horse ;</l>
     <l n="94">Whence like a risen moon she smiled on him ,</l>
     <l n="95">Nor turned away , although a radiant blush</l>
     <l n="96">Shone in her cheek , and shadowed in her eyes .</l>
     <l n="97">But he was never sure if from her heart</l>
     <l n="98">Or from the rosy sunset came the flush .</l>
     <l n="99">Again she thanked him , while again he stood</l>
     <l n="100">Bewildered in her beauty . Not a word</l>
     <l n="101">Answered her words that flowed , folded in tones</l>
     <l n="102">Round which dissolving lambent music played ,</l>
     <l n="103">Like dropping water in a silver cup ;</l>
     <l n="104">Till , round the shoulder of the neighbouring hill ,</l>
     <l n="105">Sudden she disappeared . And he awoke ,</l>
     <l n="106">And called himself hard names , and turned and went</l>
     <l n="107">After his horses , bending too his head .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="108">Ah God ! when Beauty passes by the door ,</l>
     <l n="109">Although she ne'er came in , the house grows bare .</l>
     <l n="110">Shut , shut the door ; there 's nothing in the house .</l>
     <l n="111">Why seems it always that it should be ours ?</l>
     <l n="112">A secret lies behind which Thou dost know ,</l>
     <l n="113">And I can partly guess .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="114">But think not then ,</l>
     <l n="115">The holder of the plough had many sighs</l>
     <l n="116">Upon his bed that night ; or other dreams</l>
     <l n="117">Than pleasant rose upon his view in sleep ,</l>
     <l n="118">Within the magic crystal of the soul ;</l>
     <l n="119">Nor that the airy castles of his brain</l>
     <l n="120">Had less foundation than the air admits .</l>
     <l n="121">But read my simple tale , scarce worth the name ;</l>
     <l n="122">And answer , if he gained not from the fair</l>
     <l n="123">Beauty 's best gift ; and proved her not , in sooth ,</l>
     <l n="124">An angel vision from a higher world .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="125">Not much of her I tell . Her changeful life</l>
     <l n="126">Where part the waters on the mountain ridge ,</l>
     <l n="127">Flowed down the other side apart from his .</l>
     <l n="128">Her tale hath wiled deep sighs on summer eves ,</l>
     <l n="129">Where in the ancient mysteries of woods</l>
     <l n="130">Walketh a man who worships womanhood .</l>
     <l n="131">Soon was she orphaned of such parent-haunts ;</l>
     <l n="132">Surrounded with dead glitter , not the shine</l>
     <l n="133">Of leaves in wind and sunlight ; while the youth</l>
     <l n="134">Breathed on , as if a constant breaking dawn</l>
     <l n="135">Sent forth the new-born wind upon his brow ;</l>
     <l n="136">And knew the morning light was climbing up</l>
     <l n="137">The further hill-side — morning light , which most ,</l>
     <l n="138">They say , reveals the inner hues of earth .</l>
     <l n="139">Now she was such as God had made her , ere</l>
     <l n="140">The world had tried to spoil her ; tried , I say ,</l>
     <l n="141">And half-succeeded , failing utterly .</l>
     <l n="142">Fair was she , frank , and innocent as a child</l>
     <l n="143">That stares you in the eyes ; fearless of ill ,</l>
     <l n="144">Because she knew it not ; and brave withal ,</l>
     <l n="145">Because she drank the draught that maketh strong ,</l>
     <l n="146">The charmed country air . Her father 's house —</l>
     <l n="147">A Scottish laird was he , of ancient name —</l>
     <l n="148">Stood only two miles off amid the hills ;</l>
     <l n="149">But though she often passed alone as now ,</l>
     <l n="150">The youth had never seen her face before ,</l>
     <l n="151">And might not twice . Yet was not once enough ?</l>
     <l n="152">It left him not . She , as the harvest moon</l>
     <l n="153">That goeth on her way , and knoweth not</l>
     <l n="154">The fields of grain whose ripening ears she fills</l>
     <l n="155">With wealth of life and human joyfulness ,</l>
     <l n="156">Went on , and knew not of the influence</l>
     <l n="157">She left behind ; yea , never thought of him ;</l>
     <l n="158">Save at those times when , all at once , old scenes</l>
     <l n="159">Return uncalled , with wonder that they come ,</l>
     <l n="160">Amidst far other thoughts and other cares ;</l>
     <l n="161">Sinking again into their ancient graves ,</l>
     <l n="162">Till some far-whispered necromantic spell</l>
     <l n="163">Loose them once more to wander for a space .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="164">Again I say , no fond romance of love ,</l>
     <l n="165">No argument of possibilities ,</l>
     <l n="166">If he were some one , and she claimed his aid ,</l>
     <l n="167">Turned his clear brain into a nest of dreams .</l>
     <l n="168">As soon he had sat down and twisted cords</l>
     <l n="169">To snare , and carry home for daylight use ,</l>
     <l n="170">Some woman-angel , wandering half-seen</l>
     <l n="171">On moonlight wings , o'er withered autumn fields .</l>
     <l n="172">But when he rose next morn , and went abroad ,</l>
     <l n="173">( The exultation of his new-found rank</l>
     <l n="174">Already settling into dignity ,)</l>
     <l n="175">He found the earth was beautiful . The sky ,</l>
     <l n="176">Which shone with expectation of the sun ,</l>
     <l n="177">Somehow , he knew not how , was like her face .</l>
     <l n="178">He grieved almost to plough the daisies down ;</l>
     <l n="179">Something they shared in common with that smile</l>
     <l n="180">Wherewith she crowned his manhood ; and they fell</l>
     <l n="181">Bent in the furrow , sometimes , with their heads</l>
     <l n="182">Just out imploringly . A hedgehog ran</l>
     <l n="183">With tangled mesh of bristling spikes , and face</l>
     <l n="184">Helplessly innocent , across the field :</l>
     <l n="185">He let it run , and blessed it as it ran .</l>
     <l n="186">At noon returning , something drew his feet</l>
     <l n="187">Into the barn . Entering , he gazed and stood .</l>
     <l n="188">Through the rent roof alighting , one sunbeam ,</l>
     <l n="189">Blazing upon the straw one golden spot ,</l>
     <l n="190">Dulled all the yellow heap , and sank far down ,</l>
     <l n="191">Like flame inverted , through the loose-piled mound ,</l>
     <l n="192">Crossing the splendour with the shadow-straws ,</l>
     <l n="193">In lines innumerable . ‘ Twas so bright ,</l>
     <l n="194">The eye was cheated with a spectral smoke</l>
     <l n="195">That rose as from a fire . He never knew ,</l>
     <l n="196">Before , how beautiful the sunlight was ;</l>
     <l n="197">Though he had seen it in the grassy fields ,</l>
     <l n="198">And on the river , and the ripening corn ,</l>
     <l n="199">A thousand times . He threw him on the heap ,</l>
     <l n="200">And gazing down into the glory-gulf ,</l>
     <l n="201">Dreamed as a boy half-sleeping by the fire ;</l>
     <l n="202">And dreaming rose , and got his horses out .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="203">God , and not woman , is the heart of all .</l>
     <l n="204">But she , as priestess of the visible earth ,</l>
     <l n="205">Holding the key , herself most beautiful ,</l>
     <l n="206">Had come to him , and flung the portals wide .</l>
     <l n="207">He entered in : each beauty was a glass</l>
     <l n="208">That gleamed the woman back upon his view .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="209">Already in these hours his growing soul</l>
     <l n="210">Put forth the white tip of a floral bud ,</l>
     <l n="211">Ere long to be a crown-like , shadowy flower .</l>
     <l n="212">For , by his songs , and joy in ancient tales ,</l>
     <l n="213">He showed the seed lay hidden in his heart ,</l>
     <l n="214">A safe sure treasure , hidden even from him ,</l>
     <l n="215">And notwithstanding mellowing all his spring ;</l>
     <l n="216">Until , like sunshine with its genial power ,</l>
     <l n="217">Came the fair maiden 's face : the seed awoke .</l>
     <l n="218">I need not follow him through many days ;</l>
     <l n="219">Nor tell the joys that rose around his path ,</l>
     <l n="220">Ministering pleasure for his labour 's meed ;</l>
     <l n="221">Nor how each morning was a boon to him ;</l>
     <l n="222">Nor how the wind , with nature 's kisses fraught ,</l>
     <l n="223">Flowed inward to his soul ; nor how the flowers</l>
     <l n="224">Asserted each an individual life ,</l>
     <l n="225">A separate being , for and in his thought ;</l>
     <l n="226">Nor how the stormy days that intervened</l>
     <l n="227">Called forth his strength , and songs that quelled their force ;</l>
     <l n="228">Nor how in winter-time , when thick the snow</l>
     <l n="229">Armed the sad fields from gnawing of the frost ,</l>
     <l n="230">And the low sun but skirted his far realms ,</l>
     <l n="231">And sank in early night , he took his place</l>
     <l n="232">Beside the fire ; and by the feeble lamp</l>
     <l n="233">Head book on book ; and lived in other lives ,</l>
     <l n="234">And other needs , and other climes than his ;</l>
     <l n="235">And added other beings thus to his .</l>
     <l n="236">But I must tell that love of knowledge grew</l>
     <l n="237">Within him to a passion and a power ;</l>
     <l n="238">Till , through the night ( all dark , except the moon</l>
     <l n="239">Shone frosty o'er the lea , or the white snow</l>
     <l n="240">Gave back all motes of light that else had sunk</l>
     <l n="241">Into the thirsty earth ) he bent his way</l>
     <l n="242">Over the moors to where the little town</l>
     <l n="243">Lay gathered in the hollow . There the man</l>
     <l n="244">Who taught the children all the shortened day ,</l>
     <l n="245">Taught other scholars in the long fore-night ;</l>
     <l n="246">And youths who in the shop , or in the barn ,</l>
     <l n="247">Or at the loom , had done their needful work ,</l>
     <l n="248">Came to his schoolroom in the murky night ,</l>
     <l n="249">And found the fire aglow , the candles lit ,</l>
     <l n="250">And the good master waiting for his men .</l>
     <l n="251">Here mathematics wiled him to their heights ;</l>
     <l n="252">And strange consent of lines to form and law</l>
     <l n="253">Made Euclid like a great romance of truth .</l>
     <l n="254">The master saw with wonder how the youth</l>
     <l n="255">All eagerly devoured the offered food ,</l>
     <l n="256">And straightway longed to lead him ; with that hope</l>
     <l n="257">Of sympathy which urges him that knows</l>
     <l n="258">To multiply great knowledge by its gift ;</l>
     <l n="259">That so two souls ere long may see one truth ,</l>
     <l n="260">And , turning , see each others ’ faces shine .</l>
     <l n="261">So he proposed the classics ; and the youth</l>
     <l n="262">Caught at the offer ; and for many a night ,</l>
     <l n="263">When others lay and lost themselves in sleep ,</l>
     <l n="264">He groped his way with lexicon and rule ,</l>
     <l n="265">Through ancient deeds embalmed in Latin old ,</l>
     <l n="266">Or poet-woods alive with gracious forms ;</l>
     <l n="267">Wherein his knowledge of the English tongue</l>
     <l n="268">( Through reading many books ) much aided him —</l>
     <l n="269">For the soul 's language is the same in all .</l>
     <l n="270">At length his progress , through the master 's word ,</l>
     <l n="271">Proud of his pupil , reached the father 's ears .</l>
     <l n="272">Great joy arose within him , and he vowed ,</l>
     <l n="273">If caring , sparing would accomplish it ,</l>
     <l n="274">He should to college , and should have his fill</l>
     <l n="275">Of that same learning .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="276">So to school he went ,</l>
     <l n="277">Instead of to the plough ; and ere a year ,</l>
     <l n="278">He wore the scarlet gown with the close sleeves .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="279">Awkward at first , but with a dignity</l>
     <l n="280">That soon found fit embodiment in speech</l>
     <l n="281">And gesture and address , he made his way ,</l>
     <l n="282">Not seeking it , to the respect of youths ,</l>
     <l n="283">In whom respect is of the rarer gifts .</l>
     <l n="284">Likewise by the consent of accidents ,</l>
     <l n="285">More than his worth , society , so called ,</l>
     <l n="286">In that great northern city , to its rooms</l>
     <l n="287">Invited him . He entered . Dazzled first ,</l>
     <l n="288">Not only by the brilliance of the show ,</l>
     <l n="289">In lights and mirrors , gems , and crowded eyes ;</l>
     <l n="290">But by the surface lights of many minds</l>
     <l n="291">Cut like rose-diamonds into many planes ,</l>
     <l n="292">Which , catching up the wandering rays of fact ,</l>
     <l n="293">Reflected , coloured , tossed them here and there ,</l>
     <l n="294">In varied brilliance , as if quite new-born</l>
     <l n="295">From out the centre , not from off the face —</l>
     <l n="296">Dazzled at first , I say , he soon began</l>
     <l n="297">To see how little thought could sparkle well ,</l>
     <l n="298">And turn him , even in the midst of talk ,</l>
     <l n="299">Back to the silence of his homely toils .</l>
     <l n="300">Around him still and ever hung an air</l>
     <l n="301">Born of the fields , and plough , and cart , and scythe ;</l>
     <l n="302">A kind of clumsy grace , in which gay girls</l>
     <l n="303">Saw but the clumsiness ; while those with light ,</l>
     <l n="304">Instead of glitter , in their quiet eyes ,</l>
     <l n="305">Saw the grace too ; yea , sometimes , when he talked ,</l>
     <l n="306">Saw the grace only ; and began at last ,</l>
     <l n="307">As he sought none , to seek him in the crowd</l>
     <l n="308">( After a maiden fashion ) , that they might</l>
     <l n="309">Hear him dress thoughts , not pay poor compliments .</l>
     <l n="310">Yet seldom thus was he seduced from toil ;</l>
     <l n="311">Or if one eve his windows showed no light ,</l>
     <l n="312">The next , they faintly gleamed in candle-shine ,</l>
     <l n="313">Till far into the morning . And he won</l>

     <l n="315">And if increased familiarity</l>

     <l n="317">Where youths of all kinds meet , endangered there</l>
     <l n="318">A mind more willing to be pure than most —</l>
     <l n="319">Oft when the broad rich humour of a jest ,</l>
     <l n="320">Did , with its breezy force , make radiant way</l>
     <l n="321">For pestilential vapours following —</l>
     <l n="322">Arose within his sudden silent mind ,</l>
     <l n="323">The maiden face that smiled and blushed on him ;</l>
     <l n="324">That lady face , insphered beyond his earth ,</l>
     <l n="325">Yet visible to him as any star</l>
     <l n="326">That shines unwavering . I cannot tell</l>
     <l n="327">In words the tenderness that glowed across</l>
     <l n="328">His bosom — burned it clean in will and thought ;</l>
     <l n="329">“ Shall that sweet face be blown by laughter rude</l>
     <l n="330">Out of the soul where it has deigned to come ,</l>

     <l n="332">He almost wept for shame , that those two thoughts</l>
     <l n="333">Should ever look each other in the face ,</l>
     <l n="334">Meeting in his house . Thus he made to her ,</l>
     <l n="335">For love , an offering of purity .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="336">And if the homage that he sometimes found ,</l>

     <l n="338">Assents , and silent listenings when he spoke ,</l>
     <l n="339">Threatened yet more his life 's simplicity ;</l>
     <l n="340">An antidote of nature ever came ,</l>
     <l n="341">Even nature 's self . For , in the summer months ,</l>
     <l n="342">His former haunts and boyhood 's circumstance</l>
     <l n="343">Received him back within old influences .</l>
     <l n="344">And he , too noble to despise the past ,</l>
     <l n="345">Too proud to be ashamed of manhood 's toil ,</l>
     <l n="346">Too wise to fancy that a gulf lay wide</l>
     <l n="347">Betwixt the labouring hand and thinking brain ,</l>

     <l n="349">Because a workman , clothed himself again</l>

     <l n="352">Smoothing with harrows what the plough had ridged .</l>
     <l n="353">With ever fresher joy he hailed the fields ,</l>
     <l n="354">Returning still with larger powers of sight :</l>

     <l n="357">His labour kept him true to life and fact ,</l>
     <l n="358">Casting out worldly judgments , false desires ,</l>
     <l n="359">And vain distinctions . Ever , at his toil ,</l>
     <l n="360">New thoughts arose ; which , when still night awoke ,</l>

     <l n="386">Not in one channel flowed his seeking thoughts ;</l>

     <l n="1093">Straightway the fount of possibilities</l>
     <l n="1094">Began to gurgle , under , in his soul .</l>
     <l n="1095">Anon the lava-stream burst forth amain ,</l>
     <l n="1096">And glowed , and scorched , and blasted as it flowed .</l>
     <l n="1097">For purest souls sometimes have direst fears ,</l>
     <l n="1098">In ghost-hours when the shadow of the earth</l>

     <l n="1100">Who is afar and busy with the rest .</l>
     <l n="1101">“ If my high lady be but only such</l>
     <l n="1102">As some men say of women — very pure</l>
     <l n="1103">When dressed in white , and shining in men 's eyes ,</l>

     <l n="1105">Around them in the aether of the souls ,</l>
     <l n="1106">Felt at the root where senses meet in one</l>
     <l n="1107">Like dim-remembered airs and rhymes and hues ;</l>
     <l n="1108">But when alone , at best a common thing ,</l>
     <l n="1109">With earthward thoughts , and feet that are of earth !</l>
     <l n="1110">Ah no — it cannot be ! She is of God .</l>
     <l n="1111">But then , fair things may perish ; higher life</l>
     <l n="1112">Gives deeper death ; fair gifts make fouler faults :</l>
     <l n="1113">Women themselves — I dare not think the rest .</l>

    <head>THE OUTER DREAM .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Young , as the day 's first-born Titanic brood ,</l>
     <l n="2">Lifting their foreheads jubilant to heaven ,</l>
     <l n="3">Rose the great mountains on my opening dream .</l>
     <l n="4">And yet the aged peace of countless years</l>
     <l n="5">Reposed on every crag and precipice</l>
     <l n="6">Outfacing ruggedly the storms that swept</l>
     <l n="7">Far overhead the sheltered furrow-vales ;</l>
     <l n="8">Which smiled abroad in green as the clouds broke</l>
     <l n="9">Drifting adown the tide of the wind-waves ,</l>
     <l n="10">Till shattered on the mountain rocks . Oh ! still ,</l>
     <l n="11">And cold and hard to look upon , like men</l>
     <l n="12">Who do stern deeds in times of turbulence ,</l>
     <l n="13">Quell the hail-rattle with their granite brows ,</l>
     <l n="14">And let the thunder burst and pass away —</l>
     <l n="15">They too did gather round sky-dwelling peaks</l>
     <l n="16">The trailing garments of the travelling sun ,</l>
     <l n="17">Which he had lifted from his ocean-bed ,</l>
     <l n="18">And swept along his road . They rent them down</l>
     <l n="19">In scattering showers upon the trees and grass ,</l>
     <l n="20">In noontide rains with heavy ringing drops ,</l>
     <l n="21">Or in still twilight moisture tenderly .</l>
     <l n="22">And from their sides were born the gladsome streams ;</l>
     <l n="23">Some creeping gently out in tiny springs ,</l>
     <l n="24">As they were just created , scarce a foot</l>
     <l n="25">From the hill 's surface , in the matted roots</l>
     <l n="26">Of plants , whose green betrays the secret birth ;</l>
     <l n="27">Some hurrying forth from caverns deep and dark ,</l>
     <l n="28">Upfilling to the brim a basin huge ,</l>
     <l n="29">Thick covered with soft moss , greening the wave ,</l>
     <l n="30">As evermore it welled over the edge</l>
     <l n="31">Upon the rocks below in boiling heaps ;</l>
     <l n="32">Fit basin for a demi-god at morn ,</l>
     <l n="33">Waking amid the crags , to lave his limbs ,</l>
     <l n="34">Then stride , Hyperion , o'er sunhYpppHeNpaven peaks .</l>
     <l n="35">And down the hill-side sped the fresh-born wave ,</l>
     <l n="36">Now hid from sight in arched caverns cold ,</l>
     <l n="37">Now arrowing slantwise down the terraced steep ,</l>
     <l n="38">Now springing like a child from step to step</l>
     <l n="39">Of the rough water-stair ; until it found</l>
     <l n="40">A deep-hewn passage for its slower course ,</l>
     <l n="41">Guiding it down to lowliness and rest ,</l>
     <l n="42">Betwixt wet walls of darkness , darker yet</l>
     <l n="43">With pine trees lining all their sides like hair ,</l>
     <l n="44">Or as their own straight needles clothe their boughs ;</l>
     <l n="45">Until at length in broader light it ran ,</l>
     <l n="46">With more articulate sounds amid the stones ,</l>
     <l n="47">In the slight shadow of the maiden birch ,</l>
     <l n="48">And the stream-loving willow ; and ere long</l>
     <l n="49">Great blossoming trees dropt flowers upon its breast ;</l>
     <l n="50">Chiefly the crimson-spotted , cream-white flowers ,</l>
     <l n="51">Heaped up in cones amid cone-drooping leaves ;</l>
     <l n="52">Green hanging leaf-cones , towering white flower-cones</l>
     <l n="53">Upon the great cone-fashioned chestnut tree .</l>
     <l n="54">Each made a tiny ripple where it fell ,</l>
     <l n="55">The trembling pleasure of the smiling wave ,</l>
     <l n="56">Which bore it then , in slow funereal course ,</l>
     <l n="57">Down to the outspread sunny sheen , where lies</l>
     <l n="58">The lake uplooking to the far-off snow ,</l>
     <l n="59">Its mother still , though now so far away ;</l>
     <l n="60">Feeding it still with long descending lines</l>
     <l n="61">Of shining , speeding streams , that gather peace</l>
     <l n="62">In journeying to the rest of that still lake</l>
     <l n="63">Now lying sleepy in the warm red sun ,</l>
     <l n="64">Which says its dear goodnight , and goeth down .</l>

     <l n="78">All things are clothed in an obscuring light ,</l>
     <l n="79">Fusing their outline in a dreamy mass ;</l>
     <l n="80">Some faint , dim shadows from thy beauty fall</l>
     <l n="81">On the clear lake which melts them half away —</l>
     <l n="82">Shine faster , stronger , O reviving moon !</l>

     <l n="84">And through a warm thin summer mist she shines ,</l>
     <l n="85">A silver setting to the diamond stars ;</l>
     <l n="86">And the dark boat cleaveth a glittering way ,</l>
     <l n="87">Where the one steady beauty of the moon</l>
     <l n="88">Makes many changing beauties on the wave</l>
     <l n="89">Broken by jewel-dropping oars , which drive</l>
     <l n="90">The boat , as human impulses the soul ;</l>
     <l n="91">While , like the sovereign will , the helm 's firm law</l>
     <l n="92">Directs the whither of the onward force .</l>
     <l n="93">At length midway he leaves the swaying oars</l>
     <l n="94">Half floating in the blue gulf underneath ,</l>
     <l n="95">And on a load of gathered flowers reclines ,</l>
     <l n="96">Leaving the boat to any air that blows ,</l>
     <l n="97">His soul to any pulse from the unseen heart .</l>
     <l n="98">Straight from the helm a white hand gleaming flits ,</l>
     <l n="99">And settles on his face , and nestles there ,</l>
     <l n="100">Pale , night-belated butterfly , to sleep .</l>
     <l n="101">For on her knees his head lies satisfied ;</l>
     <l n="102">And upward , downward , dark eyes look and rest ,</l>
     <l n="103">Finding their home in likeness . Lifting then</l>
     <l n="104">Her hair upon her white arm heavily ,</l>
     <l n="105">The overflowing of her beauteousness ,</l>
     <l n="106">Her hand that cannot trespass , singles out</l>
     <l n="107">Some of the curls that stray across her lap ;</l>
     <l n="108">And mingling dark locks in the pallid light ,</l>
     <l n="109">She asks him which is darker of the twain ,</l>
     <l n="110">Which his , which hers , and laugheth like a lute .</l>
     <l n="111">But now her hair , an unvexed cataract ,</l>
     <l n="112">Falls dark and heavy round his upturned face ,</l>
     <l n="113">And with a heaven shuts out the shallow sky ,</l>
     <l n="114">A heaven profound , the home of two black stars ;</l>
     <l n="115">Till , tired with gazing , face to face they lie ,</l>
     <l n="116">Suspended , with closed eyelids , in the night ;</l>
     <l n="117">Their bodies bathed in conscious sleepiness ,</l>
     <l n="118">While o'er their souls creeps every rippling breath</l>
     <l n="119">Of the night-gambols of the moth-winged wind ,</l>
     <l n="120">Flitting a handbreadth , folding up its wings ,</l>
     <l n="121">Its dreamy wings , then spreading them anew ,</l>
     <l n="122">And with an unfelt gliding , like the years ,</l>
     <l n="123">Wafting them to a water-lily bed ,</l>
     <l n="124">Whose shield-like leaves and chalice-bearing arms</l>
     <l n="125">Hold back the boat from the slow-sloping shore ,</l>
     <l n="126">Far as a child might shoot with his toy-bow .</l>
     <l n="127">There the long drooping grass drooped to the wave ;</l>
     <l n="128">And , ever as the moth-wind lit thereon ,</l>
     <l n="129">A small-leafed tree , whose roots were always cool ,</l>
     <l n="130">Dipped one low bow , with many sister-leaves ,</l>
     <l n="131">Upon the water 's face with a low plash ,</l>
     <l n="132">Lifting and dipping yet and yet again ;</l>
     <l n="133">And aye the water-drops rained from the leaves ,</l>
     <l n="134">With music-laughter as they found their home .</l>
     <l n="135">And from the woods came blossom-fragrance , faint ,</l>
     <l n="136">Or full , like rising , falling harmonies ;</l>
     <l n="137">Luxuriance of life , which overflows</l>
     <l n="138">In scents ethereal on the ocean air ;</l>
     <l n="139">Each breathing on the rest the blessedness</l>
     <l n="140">Of its peculiar being , filled with good</l>
     <l n="141">Till its cup runneth over with delight :</l>
     <l n="142">They drank the mingled odours as they lay ,</l>
     <l n="143">The air in which the sensuous being breathes ,</l>

     <l n="35">Until at length slow swelled the welcome dark ,</l>
     <l n="36">A dull Lethean heaving tide of death ,</l>
     <l n="37">Up from the caves of Night to make an end ;</l>
     <l n="38">And filling every corner of the place ,</l>
     <l n="39">Choked in its waves the clanking of the looms .</l>
     <l n="40">And Earth put on her sleeping dress , and took</l>
     <l n="41">Her children home into its bosom-folds ,</l>
     <l n="42">And nursed them as a mother-ghost might sit</l>
     <l n="43">With her neglected darlings in the dark .</l>
     <l n="44">So with dim satisfaction in their hearts ,</l>
     <l n="45">Though with tired feet and aching head , they went ,</l>
     <l n="46">Parting the clinging fog to find their home .</l>
     <l n="47">It was a dreary place . Unfinished walls ,</l>
     <l n="48">Far drearier than ruins overspread</l>
     <l n="49">With long-worn sweet forgetfulness , amidst</l>
     <l n="50">Earth-heaps and bricks , rain-pools and ugliness ,</l>
     <l n="51">Rose up around , banishing further yet</l>
     <l n="52">The Earth , with its spring-time , young-mother smile ,</l>
     <l n="53">From children 's eyes that had forgot to play .</l>
     <l n="54">But though the house was dull and wrapt in fog ,</l>
     <l n="55">It yet awoke to life , yea , cheerfulness ,</l>
     <l n="56">When darkness oped a fire-eye in the grate ,</l>
     <l n="57">And the dim candle 's smoky flame revealed</l>
     <l n="58">A room which could not be all desolate ,</l>
     <l n="59">Being a temple , proven by the signs</l>
     <l n="60">Seen in the ancient place . For here was light ;</l>
     <l n="61">And blazing fire with darkness on its skirts ;</l>
     <l n="62">Bread ; and pure water , ready to make clean ,</l>
     <l n="63">Beside a chest of holiday attire ;</l>
     <l n="64">And in the twilight edges of the light ,</l>
     <l n="65">A book scarce seen ; and for the wondrous veil ,</l>
     <l n="66">Those human forms , behind which lay concealed</l>
     <l n="67">The Holy of Holies , God 's own secret place ,</l>
     <l n="68">The lowly human heart wherein He dwells .</l>
     <l n="69">And by the table-altar they sat down</l>
     <l n="70">To eat their Eucharist , God feeding them :</l>
     <l n="71">Their food was Love , made visible in Form —</l>
     <l n="72">Incarnate Love in food . For he to whom</l>
     <l n="73">A common meal can be no Eucharist ,</l>
     <l n="74">Who thanks for food and strength , not for the love</l>
     <l n="75">That made cold water for its blessedness ,</l>
     <l n="76">And wine for gladness ’ sake , has yet to learn</l>
     <l n="77">The heart-delight of inmost thankfulness</l>
     <l n="78">For innermost reception .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="79">Then they sat</l>
     <l n="80">Resting with silence , the soul 's inward sleep ,</l>
     <l n="81">Which feedeth it with strength ; till gradually</l>
     <l n="82">They grew aware of light , that overcame</l>
     <l n="83">The light within , and through the dingy blind ,</l>
     <l n="84">Cast from the window-frame , two shadow-glooms</l>
     <l n="85">That made a cross of darkness on the white ,</l>
     <l n="86">Dark messenger of light itself unseen .</l>
     <l n="87">The woman rose , and half she put aside</l>
     <l n="88">The veil that hid the whole of glorious night ;</l>
     <l n="89">And lo ! a wind had mowed the earth-sprung fog ;</l>
     <l n="90">And lo ! on high the white exultant moon</l>
     <l n="91">From clear blue window curtained all with white ,</l>
     <l n="92">Greeted them , at their shadowy window low ,</l>
     <l n="93">With quiet smile ; for two things made her glad :</l>
     <l n="94">One that she saw the glory of the sun ;</l>
     <l n="95">For while the earth lay all athirst for light ,</l>
     <l n="96">She drank the fountain-waves . The other joy ;</l>
     <l n="97">Sprung from herself : she fought the darkness well ,</l>
     <l n="98">Thinning the great cone-shadow of the earth ,</l>
     <l n="99">Paling its ebon hue with radiant showers</l>
     <l n="100">Upon its sloping side . The woman said ,</l>
     <l n="101">With hopeful look : “ To-morrow will be bright</l>
     <l n="102">With sunshine for our holiday — to-morrow —</l>
     <l n="103">Think ! we shall see the green fields in the sun . ”</l>
     <l n="104">So with hearts hoping for a simple joy ,</l>
     <l n="105">Yet high withal , being no less than the sun ,</l>
     <l n="106">They laid them down in nightly death that waits</l>
     <l n="107">Patiently for the day .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="108">That sun was high</l>
     <l n="109">When they awoke at length . The moon , low down ,</l>
     <l n="110">Had almost vanished , clothed upon with light ;</l>
     <l n="111">And night was swallowed up of day . In haste ,</l>
     <l n="112">Chiding their weariness that leagued with sleep ,</l>
     <l n="113">They , having clothed themselves in clean attire ,</l>
     <l n="114">By the low door , stooping with priestly hearts ,</l>
     <l n="115">Entered God 's vision-room , his wonder-world .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="116">One side the street , the windows all were moons</l>
     <l n="117">To light the other that in shadow lay .</l>
     <l n="118">The path was almost dry ; the wind asleep .</l>
     <l n="119">And down the sunny side a woman came</l>
     <l n="120">In a red cloak that made the whole street glad —</l>
     <l n="121">Fit clothing , though she was so feeble and old ;</l>
     <l n="122">For when they stopped and asked her how she fared ,</l>
     <l n="123">She said with cheerful words , and smile that owed</l>
     <l n="124">None of its sweetness to an ivory lining :</l>
     <l n="125">“ I 'm always better in the open air . ”</l>
     <l n="126">“ Dear heart ! ” said they , “ how freely she will breathe</l>
     <l n="127">In the open air of heaven ! ” She stood in the morn</l>
     <l n="128">Like a belated autumn-flower in spring ,</l>
     <l n="129">Dazed by the rushing of the new-born life</l>
     <l n="130">Up the earth 's winding cavern-stairs to see</l>
     <l n="131">Through window-buds the calling , waking sun .</l>
     <l n="132">Or as in dreams we meet the ghost of one</l>
     <l n="133">Beloved in youth , who walketh with few words ,</l>
     <l n="134">And they are of the past . Yet , joy to her !</l>
     <l n="135">She too from earthy grave was climbing up</l>
     <l n="136">Unto the spirit-windows high and far ,</l>
     <l n="137">She the new life for a celestial spring ,</l>
     <l n="138">Answering the light that shineth evermore .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="139">With hopeful sadness thus they passed along</l>
     <l n="140">Dissolving streets towards the smiles of spring ,</l>
     <l n="141">Of which green visions gleamed and glided by ,</l>
     <l n="142">Across far-narrowing avenues of brick :</l>
     <l n="143">The ripples only of her laughter float</l>
     <l n="144">Through the low winding caverns of the town ;</l>
     <l n="145">Yet not a stone upon the paven street ,</l>
     <l n="146">But shareth in the impulse of her joy ,</l>
     <l n="147">Heaven 's life that thrills anew through the outworn earth ;</l>
     <l n="148">Descending like the angel that did stir</l>
     <l n="149">Bethesda 's pool , and made the sleepy wave</l>
     <l n="150">Pulse with quick healing through the withered limb ,</l>
     <l n="151">In joyous pangs . By an unfinished street ,</l>
     <l n="152">Forth came they on a wide and level space ;</l>
     <l n="153">Green fields lay side by side , and hedgerow trees</l>
     <l n="154">Stood here and there as waiting for some good .</l>
     <l n="155">But no calm river meditated through</l>
     <l n="156">The weary flat to the less level sea ;</l>
     <l n="157">No forest trees on pillared stems and boughs</l>
     <l n="158">Bent in great Gothic arches , bore aloft</l>
     <l n="159">A cloudy temple-roof of tremulous leaves ;</l>
     <l n="160">No clear line where the kissing lips of sky</l>
     <l n="161">And earth meet undulating , but a haze</l>
     <l n="162">That hides — oh , if it hid wild waves ! alas !</l>
     <l n="163">It hides but fields , it hides but fields and trees !</l>
     <l n="164">Save eastward , where a few hills , far away ,</l>
     <l n="165">Came forth in the sun , or drew back when the clouds</l>
     <l n="166">Went over them , dissolving them in shade .</l>
     <l n="167">But the life-robe of earth was beautiful ,</l>
     <l n="168">As all most common things are loveliest ;</l>
     <l n="169">A forest of green waving fairy trees ,</l>
     <l n="170">That carpeted the earth for lowly feet ,</l>
     <l n="171">Bending unto their tread , lowliest of all</l>
     <l n="172">Earth 's lowly children born for ministering</l>
     <l n="173">Unto the heavenly stranger , stately man ;</l>
     <l n="174">That he , by subtle service from all kinds ,</l>
     <l n="175">From every breeze and every bounding wave ,</l>
     <l n="176">From night-sky cavernous with heaps of storm ,</l>
     <l n="177">And from the hill rejoicing in the sun ,</l>
     <l n="178">Might grow a humble , lowly child of God ;</l>
     <l n="179">Lowly , as knowing his high parentage ;</l>
     <l n="180">Humble , because all beauties wait on him ,</l>
     <l n="181">Like lady-servants ministering for love .</l>
     <l n="182">And he that hath not rock , and hill , and stream ,</l>
     <l n="183">Must learn to look for other beauty near ;</l>
     <l n="184">To know the face of ocean solitudes ,</l>
     <l n="185">The darkness dashed with glory , and the shades</l>
     <l n="186">Wind-fretted , and the mingled tints upthrown</l>
     <l n="187">From shallow bed , or raining from the sky .</l>
     <l n="188">And he that hath not ocean , and dwells low ,</l>
     <l n="189">Not hill-befriended , if his eyes have ceased</l>
     <l n="190">To drink enjoyment from the billowy grass ,</l>
     <l n="191">And from the road-side flower ( like one who dwells</l>
     <l n="192">With homely features round him every day ,</l>
     <l n="193">And so takes refuge in the loving eyes</l>
     <l n="194">Which are their heaven , the dwelling-place of light ) ,</l>
     <l n="195">Must straightway lift his eyes unto the heavens ,</l>
     <l n="196">Like God 's great palette , where His artist hand</l>
     <l n="197">Never can strike the brush , but beauty wakes ;</l>
     <l n="198">Vast sweepy comet-curves , that net the soul</l>
     <l n="199">In pleasure ; endless sky-stairs ; patient clouds ,</l>
     <l n="200">White till they blush at the sun 's goodnight kiss ;</l>
     <l n="201">And filmy pallours , and great mountain crags .</l>
     <l n="202">But beyond all , absorbing all the rest ,</l>
     <l n="203">Lies the great heaven , the expression of deep space ,</l>
     <l n="204">Foreshortened to a vaulted dome of blue ;</l>
     <l n="205">The Infinite , crowded in a single glance ,</l>
     <l n="206">Where yet the eye descends depth within depth ;</l>
     <l n="207">Like mystery of Truth , clothed in high form ,</l>
     <l n="208">Evasive , spiritual , no limiting ,</l>
     <l n="209">But something that denies an end , and yet</l>
     <l n="210">Can be beheld by wondering human eyes .</l>
     <l n="211">There looking up , one well may feel how vain</l>
     <l n="212">To search for God in this vast wilderness !</l>
     <l n="213">For over him would arch void depth for ever ;</l>
     <l n="214">Nor ever would he find a God or Heaven ,</l>
     <l n="215">Though lifting wings were his to soar abroad</l>
     <l n="216">Through boundless heights of space ; or eyes to dive</l>
     <l n="217">To microscopic depths : he would come back ,</l>
     <l n="218">And say , There is no God ; and sit and weep ;</l>
     <l n="219">Till in his heart a child 's voice woke and cried ,</l>
     <l n="220">Father ! my Father ! Then the face of God</l>
     <l n="221">Breaks forth with eyes , everywhere , suddenly</l>
     <l n="222">And not a space of blue , nor floating cloud ,</l>
     <l n="223">Nor grassy vale , nor distant purple height ,</l>
     <l n="224">But , trembling with a presence all divine ,</l>
     <l n="225">Says , Here I am , my child .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="226">Gazing awhile ,</l>
     <l n="227">They let the lesson of the sky sink deep</l>
     <l n="228">Into their hearts ; withdrawing then their eyes ,</l>
     <l n="229">They knew the Earth again . And as they went ,</l>
     <l n="230">Oft in the changing heavens , those distant hills</l>
     <l n="231">Shone clear upon the horizon . Then awoke</l>
     <l n="232">A strange and unknown longing in their souls ,</l>
     <l n="233">As if for something loved in years gone by ,</l>
     <l n="234">And vanished in its beauty and its love</l>
     <l n="235">So long , that it retained no name or form ,</l>
     <l n="236">And lay on childhood 's verge , all but forgot ,</l>
     <l n="237">Wrapt in the enchanted rose-mists of that land :</l>
     <l n="238">As if amidst those hills were wooded dells ,</l>
     <l n="239">Summer , and gentle winds , and odours free ,</l>
     <l n="240">Deep sleeping waters , gorgeous flowers , and birds ,</l>
     <l n="241">Pure winged throats . But here , all things around</l>
     <l n="242">Were in their spring . The very light that lay</l>
     <l n="243">Upon the grass seemed new-born like the grass ,</l>
     <l n="244">Sprung with it from the earth . The very stones</l>
     <l n="245">Looked warm . The brown ploughed earth seemed swelling up ,</l>
     <l n="246">Filled like a sponge with sunbeams , which lay still ,</l>
     <l n="247">Nestling unseen , and broodingly , and warm ,</l>
     <l n="248">In every little nest , corner , or crack ,</l>
     <l n="249">Wherein might hide a blind and sleepy seed ,</l>
     <l n="250">Waiting the touch of penetrative life</l>
     <l n="251">To wake , and grow , and beautify the earth .</l>
     <l n="252">The mossy stems and boughs , where yet no life</l>
     <l n="253">Exuberant overflowed in buds and leaves ,</l>
     <l n="254">Were clothed in golden splendours , interwoven</l>
     <l n="255">With many shadows from the branches bare .</l>
     <l n="256">And through their tops the west wind rushing went ,</l>
     <l n="257">Calling aloud the sleeping sap within :</l>
     <l n="258">The thrill passed downwards from the roots in air</l>
     <l n="259">To the roots tremulous in the embracing ground .</l>
     <l n="260">And though no buds with little dots of light</l>
     <l n="261">Sparkled the darkness of the hedgerow twigs ;</l>
     <l n="262">Softening , expanding in the warm light-bath ,</l>
     <l n="263">Seemed the dry smoky bark .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="264">Thus in the fields</l>
     <l n="265">They spent their holiday . And when the sun</l>
     <l n="266">Was near the going down , they turned them home</l>
     <l n="267">With strengthened hearts . For they were filled with light ,</l>
     <l n="268">And with the spring ; and , like the bees , went back</l>
     <l n="269">To their dark house , laden with blessed sights ,</l>
     <l n="270">With gladsome sounds home to their treasure-cave ;</l>
     <l n="271">Where henceforth sudden gleams of spring would pass</l>
     <l n="272">Thorough the four-walled darkness of the room ;</l>

     <l n="274">Though stony streets with iron echoed round .</l>
     <l n="275">And as they crossed a field , they came by chance</l>
     <l n="276">Upon a place where once a home had been ;</l>
     <l n="277">Fragments of ruined walls , half-overgrown</l>
     <l n="278">With moss , for even stones had their green robe .</l>
     <l n="279">It had been a small cottage , with a plot</l>
     <l n="280">Of garden-ground in front , mapped out with walks</l>
     <l n="281">Now scarce discernible , but that the grass</l>
     <l n="282">Was thinner , the ground harder to the foot :</l>
     <l n="283">The place was simply shadowed with an old</l>
     <l n="284">Almost erased human carefulness .</l>
     <l n="285">Close by the ruined wall , where once had been</l>
     <l n="286">The door dividing it from the great world ,</l>
     <l n="287">Making it home , a single snowdrop grew .</l>
     <l n="288">‘ Twas the sole remnant of a family</l>
     <l n="289">Of flowers that in this garden once had dwelt ,</l>
     <l n="290">Vanished with all their hues of glowing life ,</l>

     <l n="296">The snowdrop of the heart . The heavenly child ,</l>

     <l n="4">Far northward in the East , o'er the hill-top ;</l>
     <l n="5">And fronts the splendours of the northern West ,</l>
     <l n="6">Where sunset dies into that ghostly gleam</l>
     <l n="7">That round the horizon creepeth all the night</l>
     <l n="8">Back to the jubilance of gracious morn .</l>
     <l n="9">I found my home in homeliness unchanged ;</l>
     <l n="10">For love that maketh home , unchangeable ,</l>
     <l n="11">Received me to the rights of sonship still .</l>

     <l n="26">Once on a day , my cousin Frank and I ,</l>

     <l n="32">The heavens were sunny , and the earth was green ;</l>
     <l n="33">The harebells large , and oh ! so plentiful ;</l>
     <l n="34">While butterflies , as blue as they , danced on ,</l>

     <l n="36">In sportive time to their Aeolian clang .</l>
     <l n="37">That day as we talked on without restraint ,</l>
     <l n="38">Brought near by memories of days that were ,</l>

     <l n="45">For I had wandered back to childish years ;</l>

     <l n="48">Faced up the sea-cliff at whose rocky feet</l>
     <l n="49">The billows fell and died along the coast .</l>

     <l n="51">We turned our backs upon the ripening corn ,</l>
     <l n="52">And sought the borders of the desert sea .</l>
     <l n="53">O joy of waters ! mingled with the fear</l>
     <l n="54">Of a blind force that knew not what to do ,</l>
     <l n="55">But spent its strength of waves in lashing aye</l>

     <l n="60">His shady walks , his ancient trees of state ;</l>
     <l n="61">His river , which , with course indefinite ,</l>
     <l n="62">Wandered across the sands without the wall ,</l>
     <l n="63">And lost itself in finding out the sea :</l>
     <l n="64">Within , it floated swans , white splendours ; lay</l>
     <l n="65">Beneath the fairy leap of a wire bridge ;</l>
     <l n="66">Vanished and reappeared amid the shades ,</l>
     <l n="67">And led you where the peacock 's plumy heaven</l>
     <l n="68">Bore azure suns with green and golden rays .</l>
     <l n="69">Ah ! here the skies showed higher , and the clouds</l>
     <l n="70">More summer-gracious , filled with stranger shapes ;</l>
     <l n="71">And when they rained , it was a golden rain</l>
     <l n="72">That sparkled as it fell , an odorous rain .</l>

     <l n="73">But there was one dream-spot — my tale must wait</l>
     <l n="74">Until I tell the wonder of that spot .</l>

     <l n="76">I do not know — against a steep hill-side ,</l>
     <l n="77">Whose top was with a circular temple crowned ,</l>
     <l n="78">Seen from far waves when winds were off the shore —</l>
     <l n="79">So that , beclouded , ever in the night</l>
     <l n="80">Of a luxuriant ivy , its low door ,</l>
     <l n="81">Half-filled with rainbow hues of deep-stained glass ,</l>
     <l n="82">Appeared to open right into the hill .</l>
     <l n="83">Never to sesame of mine that door</l>
     <l n="84">Yielded that room ; but through one undyed pane ,</l>
     <l n="85">Gazing with reverent curiosity ,</l>
     <l n="86">I saw a little chamber , round and high ,</l>
     <l n="87">Which but to see , was to escape the heat ,</l>
     <l n="88">And bathe in coolness of the eye and brain ;</l>
     <l n="89">For it was dark and green . Upon one side</l>
     <l n="90">A window , unperceived from without ,</l>
     <l n="91">Blocked up by ivy manifold , whose leaves ,</l>
     <l n="92">Like crowded heads of gazers , row on row ,</l>
     <l n="93">Climbed to the top ; and all the light that came</l>
     <l n="94">Through the thick veil was green , oh , kindest hue !</l>
     <l n="95">But in the midst , the wonder of the place ,</l>
     <l n="96">Against the back-ground of the ivy bossed ,</l>
     <l n="97">On a low column stood , white , pure , and still ,</l>
     <l n="98">A woman-form in marble , cold and clear .</l>
     <l n="99">I know not what it was ; it may have been</l>
     <l n="100">A Silence , or an Echo fainter still ;</l>
     <l n="101">But that form yet , if form it can be called ,</l>
     <l n="102">So undefined and pale , gleams vision-like</l>
     <l n="103">In the lone treasure-chamber of my soul ,</l>
     <l n="104">Surrounded with its mystic temple dark .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="105">Then came the thought , too joyous to keep joy ,</l>
     <l n="106">Turning to very sadness for relief :</l>
     <l n="107">To sit and dream through long hot summer days ,</l>
     <l n="108">Shrouded in coolness and sea-murmurings ,</l>
     <l n="109">Forgot by all till twilight shades grew dark ;</l>
     <l n="110">And read and read in the Arabian Nights ,</l>
     <l n="111">Till all the beautiful grew possible ;</l>
     <l n="112">And then when I had read them every one ,</l>
     <l n="113">To find behind the door , against the wall ,</l>
     <l n="114">Old volumes , full of tales , such as in dreams</l>
     <l n="115">One finds in bookshops strange , in tortuous streets ;</l>
     <l n="116">Beside me , over me , soul of the place ,</l>
     <l n="117">Filling the gloom with calm delirium ,</l>
     <l n="118">That wondrous woman-statue evermore ,</l>
     <l n="119">White , radiant ; fading , as the darkness grew ,</l>
     <l n="120">Into a ghostly pallour , that put on ,</l>
     <l n="121">To staring eyes , a vague and shifting form .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="122">But the old castle on the shattered shore —</l>
     <l n="123">Not the green refuge from the summer heat —</l>
     <l n="124">Drew forth our talk that day . For , as I said ,</l>
     <l n="125">I asked her if she knew it . She replied ,</l>
     <l n="126">“ I know it well ; ” and added instantly :</l>
     <l n="127">“ A woman used to live , my mother tells ,</l>
     <l n="128">In one of its low vaults , so near the sea ,</l>
     <l n="129">That in high tides and northern winds it was</l>
     <l n="130">No more a castle-vault , but a sea-cave ! ”</l>
     <l n="131">“ I found there , ” I replied , “ a turret stair</l>
     <l n="132">Leading from level of the ground above</l>
     <l n="133">Down to a vault , whence , through an opening square ,</l>
     <l n="134">Half window and half loophole , you look forth</l>
     <l n="135">Wide o'er the sea ; but the dim-sounding waves</l>
     <l n="136">Are many feet beneath , and shrunk in size</l>
     <l n="137">To a great ripple . I could tell you now</l>
     <l n="138">A tale I made about a little girl ,</l>
     <l n="139">Dark-eyed and pale , with long seaweed-like hair ,</l>
     <l n="140">Who haunts that room , and , gazing o'er the deep ,</l>
     <l n="141">Calls it her mother , with a childish glee ,</l>
     <l n="142">Because she knew no other . ” “ This , ” said she ,</l>
     <l n="143">“ Was not a child , but woman almost old ,</l>
     <l n="144">Whose coal-black hair had partly turned to grey ,</l>
     <l n="145">With sorrow and with madness ; and she dwelt ,</l>
     <l n="146">Not in that room high on the cliff , but down ,</l>
     <l n="147">Low down within the margin of spring tides . ”</l>
     <l n="148">And then she told me all she knew of her ,</l>
     <l n="149">As we drove onward through the sunny day .</l>
     <l n="150">It was a simple tale , with few , few facts ;</l>
     <l n="151">A life that clomb one mountain and looked forth ;</l>
     <l n="152">Then sudden sank to a low dreary plain ,</l>
     <l n="153">And wandered ever in the sound of waves ,</l>
     <l n="154">Till fear and fascination overcame ,</l>
     <l n="155">And led her trembling into life and joy .</l>
     <l n="156">Alas ! how many such are told by night ,</l>
     <l n="157">In fisher-cottages along the shore !</l>

     <l n="158">Farewell , old summer-day ; I lay you by ,</l>

     <l n="1">Aye as it listeth blows the listless wind ,</l>
     <l n="2">Filling great sails , and bending lordly masts ,</l>
     <l n="3">Or making billows in the green corn fields ,</l>
     <l n="4">And hunting lazy clouds across the blue :</l>
     <l n="5">Now , like a vapour o'er the sunny sea ,</l>
     <l n="6">It blows the vessel from the harbour 's mouth ,</l>
     <l n="7">Out ‘ mid the broken crests of seaward waves ,</l>
     <l n="8">And hovering of long-pinioned ocean birds ,</l>
     <l n="9">As if the white wave-spots had taken wing .</l>
     <l n="10">But though all space is full of spots of white ,</l>
     <l n="11">The sailor sees the little handkerchief</l>
     <l n="12">That flutters still , though wet with heavy tears</l>
     <l n="13">Which draw it earthward from the sunny wind .</l>
     <l n="14">Blow , wind ! draw out the cord that binds the twain ,</l>
     <l n="15">And breaks not , though outlengthened till the maid</l>

     <l n="18">And let love 's vision slowly , gently die ;</l>
     <l n="19">And the dim sails pass ghost-like o'er the deep ,</l>
     <l n="20">Lingering a little o'er the vanished hull ,</l>
     <l n="21">With a white farewell to the straining eyes .</l>
     <l n="22">For never more in morning 's level beam ,</l>
     <l n="23">Will the wide wings of her sea-shadowing sails</l>
     <l n="24">From the green-billowed east come dancing in ;</l>
     <l n="25">Nor ever , gliding home beneath the stars ,</l>
     <l n="26">With a faint darkness o'er the fainter sea ,</l>
     <l n="27">Will she , the ocean-swimmer , send a cry</l>
     <l n="28">Of home-come sailors , that shall wake the streets</l>
     <l n="29">With sudden pantings of dream-scaring joy .</l>

     <l n="45">From whose green head , as on the verge of time ,</l>

     <l n="55">Time passed . The shadow of a fear that hung</l>

     <l n="58">Till it o'erspread and filled her atmosphere ,</l>

     <l n="130">Down to the shore it drew her from the heights ,</l>

     <l n="1">Where'er she fled , the same voice followed her ;</l>

     <l n="54">Then sank upon the sand , and gasped , and raved .</l>
     <l n="55">This was her secret chamber , this her place</l>
     <l n="56">Of refuge from the outstretched demon-deep ,</l>
     <l n="57">All eye and voice for her , Argus more dread</l>
     <l n="58">Than he with hundred lidless watching orbs .</l>
     <l n="59">There , cowering in a nook , she sat all night ,</l>
     <l n="60">Her eyes fixed on the entrance of the cave ,</l>
     <l n="61">Through which a pale light shimmered from the sea ,</l>
     <l n="62">Until she slept , and saw the sea in dreams .</l>
     <l n="63">Except in stormy nights , when all was dark ,</l>
     <l n="64">And the wild tempest swept with slanting wing</l>
     <l n="65">Against her refuge ; and the heavy spray</l>
     <l n="66">Shot through the doorway serpentine cold arms</l>
     <l n="67">To seize the fore-doomed morsel of the sea :</l>
     <l n="68">Then she slept never ; and she would have died ,</l>

     <l n="71">With clanging pinions darted through the arch ,</l>

     <l n="73">If tides were high and winds from off the sea ,</l>
     <l n="74">Rushed through the door , and in its watery mesh</l>
     <l n="75">Clasped her waist-high , then out again to sea !</l>
     <l n="76">Out to the devilish laughter and the fog !</l>

     <l n="121">She had been faithful : the beloved owed</l>
     <l n="122">Love , youth , and gladness unto her who wept</l>
     <l n="123">Gushingly on his heart . Her warm tears flowed</l>
     <l n="124">A baptism for the life that would not cease ;</l>

    <head>THE DEATH OF THE OLD YEAR .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">The weary Old Year is dead at last ;</l>
     <l n="2">His corpse ‘ mid the ruins of Time is cast ,</l>
     <l n="3">Where the mouldering wrecks of lost Thought lie ,</l>
     <l n="4">And the rich-hued blossoms of Passion die</l>
     <l n="5">To a withering grass that droops o'er his grave ,</l>
     <l n="6">The shadowy Titan 's refuge cave .</l>
     <l n="7">Strange lights from pale moony Memory lie</l>
     <l n="8">On the weedy columns beneath its eye ;</l>
     <l n="9">And strange is the sound of the ghostlike breeze ,</l>
     <l n="10">In the lingering leaves on the skeleton trees ;</l>
     <l n="11">And strange is the sound of the falling shower ,</l>
     <l n="12">When the clouds of dead pain o'er the spirit lower ;</l>
     <l n="13">Unheard in the home he inhabiteth ,</l>
     <l n="14">The land where all lost things are gathered by Death .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="15">Alone I reclined in the closing year ;</l>
     <l n="16">Voice , nor breathing , nor step was near ;</l>
     <l n="17">And I said in the weariness of my breast :</l>
     <l n="18">Weary Old Year , thou art going to rest ;</l>
     <l n="19">O weary Old Year , I would I might be</l>
     <l n="20">One hour alone in thy dying with thee !</l>
     <l n="21">Would thou wert a spirit , whose low lament</l>
     <l n="22">Might mix with the sighs from my spirit sent ;</l>
     <l n="23">For I am weary of man and life ;</l>
     <l n="24">Weary of restless unchanging strife ;</l>
     <l n="25">Weary of change that is ever changing ;</l>
     <l n="26">Weary of thought that is ever ranging ,</l>
     <l n="27">Ever falling in efforts vain ,</l>
     <l n="28">Fluttering , upspringing from earth again ,</l>
     <l n="29">Struggling once more through the darkness to wing</l>
     <l n="30">That hangs o'er the birthplace of everything ,</l>
     <l n="31">And choked yet again in the vapour 's breast ,</l>
     <l n="32">Sinking once more to a helpless rest .</l>
     <l n="33">I am weary of tears that scarce are dry ,</l>
     <l n="34">Ere their founts are filled as the cloud goes by ;</l>
     <l n="35">Weary of feelings where each in the throng</l>
     <l n="36">Mocks at the rest as they crowd along ;</l>
     <l n="37">Where Pride over all , like a god on high ,</l>
     <l n="38">Sits enshrined in his self-complacency ;</l>
     <l n="39">Where Selfishness crawls , the snake-demon of ill ,</l>
     <l n="40">The least suspected where busiest still ;</l>
     <l n="41">Where all things evil and painful entwine ,</l>
     <l n="42">And all in their hate and their sorrow are mine :</l>
     <l n="43">O weary Old Year , I would I might be</l>
     <l n="44">One hour by thy dying , to weep with thee !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="45">Peace , the soul 's slumber , was round me shed ;</l>
     <l n="46">The sleep where thought lives , but its pain is dead ;</l>
     <l n="47">And my musings led me , a spirit-band ,</l>
     <l n="48">Through the wide realms of their native land ;</l>
     <l n="49">Till I stood by the couch of the mighty dying ,</l>
     <l n="50">A lonely shore in the midnight lying .</l>
     <l n="51">He lay as if he had laid him to sleep ,</l>
     <l n="52">And the stars above him their watch did keep ;</l>
     <l n="53">And the mournful wind with the dreamy sigh ,</l>
     <l n="54">The homeless wanderer of the sky ,</l>
     <l n="55">Was the only attendant whose gentle breath</l>
     <l n="56">Soothed him yet on the couch of death ;</l>
     <l n="57">And the dying waves of the heedless sea</l>
     <l n="58">Fell at his feet most listlessly .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="59">But he lay in peace , with his solemn eye</l>
     <l n="60">Looking far through the mists of futurity .</l>
     <l n="61">A smile gleamed over the death-dew that lay</l>
     <l n="62">On his withered cheek as life ebbed away .</l>
     <l n="63">A darkness lay on his forehead vast ;</l>
     <l n="64">But the light of expectancy o'er it was cast ,—</l>
     <l n="65">A light that shone from the coming day ,</l>
     <l n="66">Travelling unseen to the East away .</l>
     <l n="67">In his cloudy robes that lay shadowing wide ,</l>
     <l n="68">I stretched myself motionless by his side ;</l>
     <l n="69">And his eyes with their calm , unimpassioned power ,</l>
     <l n="70">Soothing my heart like an evening shower ,</l>
     <l n="71">Led in a spectral , far-billowing train ,</l>
     <l n="72">The hours of the Past through my spirit again .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="73">There were fears of evil whose stony eyes</l>
     <l n="74">Froze joy in its gushing melodies .</l>
     <l n="75">Some floated afar on thy tranquil wave ,</l>
     <l n="76">And the heart looked up from its search for a grave ;</l>
     <l n="77">While others as guests to the bosom came ,</l>
     <l n="78">And left its wild children more sorrow , less shame ;</l>
     <l n="79">For the death-look parts from their chilling brow ,</l>
     <l n="80">And they bless the heads that before them bow ;</l>
     <l n="81">And floating away in the far-off gloom .</l>
     <l n="82">Thankfulness follows them to their tomb .</l>
     <l n="83">There were Hopes that found not a place to rest</l>
     <l n="84">Their foot ‘ mid the rush of all-ocean 's breast ;</l>
     <l n="85">And home to the sickening heart flew back ,</l>
     <l n="86">But changed into sorrows upon their track ;</l>
     <l n="87">And through the moan of the darkening sea</l>
     <l n="88">Bearing no leaf from the olive-tree .</l>
     <l n="89">There were joys that looked forth with their maiden eyes ,</l>
     <l n="90">And smiled , and were gone , with a sad surprise ;</l>
     <l n="91">And the Love of the Earthly , whose beauteous form</l>
     <l n="92">Beckoned me on through sunshine and storm ;</l>
     <l n="93">But when the bounding heart sprang high ,</l>
     <l n="94">Meeting her smile with a speechless sigh ,</l>
     <l n="95">The arms sunk home with a painful start ,</l>
     <l n="96">Clasping a vacancy to the heart .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="97">And the voice of the dying I seem to hear</l>
     <l n="98">But whether his breathing is in mine ear ,</l>
     <l n="99">Or the sounds of the breaking billows roll</l>
     <l n="100">The lingering accents upon my soul ,</l>
     <l n="101">I know not ; but thus they seem to bear</l>
     <l n="102">Reproof to my soul for its faint despair :—</l>

     <l n="106">Thy soul shall live by its changing ever ;</l>
     <l n="107">Not the bubbling change of a stagnant pool ,</l>
     <l n="108">But the change of a river , flowing and full ;</l>
     <l n="109">Where all that is noble and good will grow</l>
     <l n="110">Mightier still as the full tides flow ;</l>
     <l n="111">Till it joins the hidden , the boundless sea ,</l>
     <l n="112">Rolling through depths of Eternity .</l>
     <l n="113">Blame not thy thought that it cannot reach</l>
     <l n="114">That which the Infinite must teach ;</l>
     <l n="115">Bless thy God that the Word came nigh</l>
     <l n="116">To guide thee home to thy native sky ,</l>
     <l n="117">Where all things are homely and glorious too ,</l>
     <l n="118">And the children are wondering , and glad , and true .</l>

     <l n="119">And he pointed away to an Eastern star ,</l>
     <l n="120">That gleamed through his robes o'er the ocean afar ;</l>
     <l n="121">And I knew that a star had looked o'er the rim</l>
     <l n="122">Of my world that lay all dreary and dim ;</l>
     <l n="123">And was slowly dissolving the darkness deep</l>
     <l n="124">Which , like evil nurse , had soothed me to sleep ;</l>
     <l n="125">And rising higher , and shining clearer ,</l>

    <head>A SONG IN A DREAM .</head>
     <l n="1">I dreamed of a song , I heard it sung ;</l>
     <l n="2">In the ear that sleeps not its music rung .</l>
     <l n="3">And the tones were upheld by harmonies deep ,</l>
     <l n="4">Where the spirit floated ; yea , soared , on their sweep</l>
     <l n="5">With each wild unearthly word and tone ,</l>
     <l n="6">Upward , it knew not whither bound ,</l>
     <l n="7">In a calm delirium of mystic sound —</l>
     <l n="8">Up , where the Genius of Thought alone</l>
     <l n="9">Loveth in silence to drink his fill</l>
     <l n="10">Of dews that from unknown clouds distil .</l>
     <l n="11">A woman 's voice the deep echoes awoke ,</l>
     <l n="12">In the caverns and solitudes of my soul ;</l>
     <l n="13">But such a voice had never broke</l>
     <l n="14">Through the sea of sounds that about us roll ,</l>
     <l n="15">Choking the ear in the daylight strife .</l>
     <l n="16">There was sorrow and triumph , and death and life</l>
