       <l n="4">Our lives went on together until now .</l>

       <l n="7">Our shelter when earth had no rest or shade .</l>
       <l n="8">At the same fancy we have often smiled ,</l>
       <l n="9">For the same sorrow wept ; and oft our souls ,</l>
       <l n="10">In mingling aspirations , have sent up</l>
       <l n="11">The same thanksgiving , the same burning prayer .</l>
       <l n="12">Yes , we have lived together ; we have known</l>
       <l n="13">The visible blending of the outward life</l>
       <l n="14">Made real by the holier unison</l>
       <l n="15">Of loving spirit and aspiring mind .</l>

       <l n="17">And tears — which are the diamond links of love —</l>
       <l n="18">Have made the chain of our affection strong .</l>
       <l n="19">It may be thus no more ; yet — God is good —</l>

       <l n="21">And smile that thou art happy ; and give thanks</l>

       <l n="1">I saw when Israel toiled and groaned beneath the Pharoah 's rod ,</l>
       <l n="2">And in his hopeless bondage moaned his helpless prayer to God .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="3">I saw when from the river 's brink the infant leader rose ,</l>

      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="5">I heard him at the burning bush his swift excuses bring :</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="7">“ And who am I that I should lead the people of thy choice ?</l>

       <l n="11">I marked the answer : “ Plead no more thy vain excuse to me ;</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="15">The man of doubt exchanged his fears for faith in God and right ,</l>

      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="9">
       <l n="17">The slow of speech grew eloquent , till Israel gladly heard ;</l>

      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="10">
       <l n="19">And he in fierce displeasure drove the captives from his land ;</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="11">
       <l n="21">Down the long line of two-score years I looked and saw at last ,</l>

      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="12">
       <l n="23">And heard — as Memnon 's harp had caught the sweet enchanting strain ,</l>

       <l n="27">I saw again , when sin-enslaved , by Jabin 's hand oppressed ,</l>
       <l n="28">A people 's cry went up to God for rescue and for rest .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="15">
       <l n="29">Then up rose Deborah , judge and seer , with all her valiant band ,</l>

      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="16">
       <l n="31">And Jael , wife of Heber , slew his captain with the sword ;</l>

      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="17">
       <l n="33">And woman 's voice extolled in song the great Deliverer 's name :—</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="19">
       <l n="37">I saw when Gideon led his band down to the water 's bank</l>

      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="20">
       <l n="39">And with the handful chosen thus went forth against the foe ,</l>

      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="21">
       <l n="41">Not with the thousands called from far , who pitched by Harod 's well ;</l>

      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="22">
       <l n="43">But “ Now , with these three hundred men , go forward , ” said the Lord ;</l>

      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="23">
       <l n="45">Their torches flashed like dancing flames , their trumpets loudly blew ;</l>
       <l n="46">Strange warfare ! but the Lord can save by many or by few .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="24">
       <l n="47">Once more I saw when Israel quailed before Philistia 's pride ;</l>
       <l n="48">While great Goliath , day by day , Jehovah 's power defied .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="25">
       <l n="49">The weak and timid fled away , the valiant shrank with fear ;—</l>

      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="26">
       <l n="51">Even Saul , their chosen king , forgot ( admiring Israel 's boast ! )</l>
       <l n="52">That he stood head and shoulders high above his martial host .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="27">
       <l n="53">“ And are there none , ” he cried , “ who dare to meet this vaunting foe ?</l>
       <l n="54">And must the banner of our God trail in dishonor low ? ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="28">
       <l n="55">Then forth there came a ruddy youth : “ That banner I 'll defend ;</l>

      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="30">
       <l n="59">Then spake he to the giant foe : “ A loyal servant I</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="32">
       <l n="63">‘ Twas but a pebble from the brook , sent by a loyal will ;</l>
       <l n="64">But sword and spear not mightier were God 's purpose to fulfil .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="33">
       <l n="65">For one may chase a thousand , and ten thousand flee from two ;</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="34">
       <l n="67">Years , ages pass and now I see a land beloved and fair ;</l>

      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="35">
       <l n="69">The riches of this goodly land into his coffers pour ;</l>

      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="37">
       <l n="73">Thus man is robbed of purse and soul , home of its peace and joy ;</l>

       <l n="3">Humbled and happy bows itself to Thee ,</l>
       <l n="4">Pleading that all its error and its sin</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="6">The cruel wrong swept o'er me like a flood ;</l>

       <l n="8">And all forgetful that itself could sin</l>
       <l n="9">Heaped heavy hatred on the offender 's head .</l>
       <l n="10">There came a calmer hour in which I saw</l>
       <l n="11">The strong temptation that had moved him thus</l>
       <l n="12">To barter all his better life away —</l>
       <l n="13">Love , honor , principle — to gain the world .</l>
       <l n="14">And seeing this I learned to pity him .</l>

       <l n="25">The darkness might be lifted , and the Soul ,</l>

       <l n="27">To the green pastures and the springs of life ,</l>
       <l n="28">That in the heart whence love and joy had fled ,</l>
       <l n="29">Whence hope was exiled , there might yet be peace .</l>
       <l n="30">But suddenly I queried in my heart</l>

       <l n="32">For him I counted as my life-long foe .</l>
       <l n="33">Greatly I marveled what it meant that thus</l>
       <l n="34">I had called down such blessing upon him —</l>
       <l n="35">The kindliest boon of heaven , the peace of God .</l>
       <l n="36">Deep in my soul there came an answering voice :</l>
       <l n="37">“ O Child , it is but this — thou hast forgiven ! ”</l>

      <head>A PHANTOM IN THE “ CIRCLE ”</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">Written for a literary club , to which the author had formerly belonged ,</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="3">Start not , good friends ; there was a time</l>
       <l n="4">When I , whom fate , in kindly mood ,</l>
       <l n="5">Made brief sojourner in your clime ,</l>
       <l n="6">Was glad partaker of the good</l>
       <l n="7">That from your “ Circle ” emanated ;</l>
       <l n="8">And as the seven days went ‘ round</l>
       <l n="9">The appointed “ Fourth-day evening ” found</l>
       <l n="10">Me with its members congregated .</l>
       <l n="11">And also now I recognize</l>
       <l n="12">The smiling lips and beaming eyes</l>
       <l n="13">Of some , who , cordial , kind and free ,</l>
       <l n="14">Had smiles and loving words for me .</l>
       <l n="15">Who , when I entered rose to greet ,</l>
       <l n="16">And welcome gave , sincere and sweet .</l>
       <l n="17">But that was years ago , and now</l>
       <l n="18">There may be wrinkles on my brow ;</l>
       <l n="19">There may have fled from form and face</l>
       <l n="20">The transient charms of youth and grace ,</l>
       <l n="21">And time and sadness may have thrown</l>
       <l n="22">A shadow o'er the “ chestnut brown ”</l>
       <l n="23">Of locks that once — well , let that pass ;—</l>
       <l n="24">These are but sorrowful reflections ,</l>
       <l n="25">And , like those of my looking-glass ,</l>
       <l n="26">Do but discover imperfections ;</l>
       <l n="27">So let us leave this train of thought</l>
       <l n="28">And start in happier directions .</l>
       <l n="29">But first I think it may be due</l>
       <l n="30">Alike unto myself and you ,</l>
       <l n="31">Lest some should think I may have brought</l>
       <l n="32">My ghostly presence here unsought ,</l>
       <l n="33">To make this note of explanation :—</l>
       <l n="34">That not for pride , or praise , or gloom ,</l>
       <l n="35">Or curious motive am I come ;</l>
       <l n="36">Nor yet for want of occupation ;</l>
       <l n="37">Far from intruding thus , I would</l>
       <l n="38">Have it distinctly understood</l>
       <l n="39">I 'm here by “ special invitation . ”</l>

       <l n="43">And fan me with their wings of light ,</l>
       <l n="44">And bear me to a realm more bright</l>
       <l n="45">Than fairy land or elfin home ,</l>
       <l n="46">Or that sweet world whence dreams do come</l>

       <l n="55">Presiding dignity comes forth</l>
       <l n="56">With modest but “ amazing ” worth</l>
       <l n="57">And calls the whole concern to order .</l>
       <l n="58">Then “ minutes ” penned by snow-white hand ,</l>
       <l n="59">Approved without dissension stand ;</l>
       <l n="60">And hushed is all the talk and noise</l>
       <l n="61">The while some soft or manly voice</l>
       <l n="62">From gifted author doth unfold</l>
       <l n="63">Before us treasures new and old .</l>

       <l n="68">But here our home-spun thoughts still find</l>
       <l n="69">A kindlier appreciation .</l>
       <l n="70">With hushed breath and eyes that glisten ,</l>
       <l n="71">To some fine argument we listen ,</l>
       <l n="72">From one with head so full of lore</l>
       <l n="73">That to prevent its brimming o'er</l>
       <l n="74">He must impart his information .</l>

       <l n="77">A never-ceasing reformation .</l>
       <l n="78">With rapt attention now we hear</l>
       <l n="79">A discourse upon Sound and Ear ,</l>
       <l n="80">Wherein is beautifully blended ,</l>
       <l n="81">The Science and the History ,</l>
       <l n="82">The Knowledge and the Mystery</l>
       <l n="83">So fair , when fairly comprehended .</l>
       <l n="84">Then some poetic brain is fired ,</l>

      <head>A. G.
