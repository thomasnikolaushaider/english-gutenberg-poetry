    <head>TOUSSAINT L'OUVERTURE .</head>
    <head>Toussaint L'Ouverture , the black chieftain of Hayti , was a slave on the plantation “ de Libertas , ” belonging to M. Bayou . When the rising of the negroes took place , in 1791 , Toussaint refused to join them until he had aided M. Bayou and his family to escape to Baltimore . The white man had discovered in Toussaint many noble qualities , and had instructed him in some of the first branches of education ; and the preservation of his life was owing to the negro 's gratitude for this kindness . In 1797 , Toussaint L'Ouverture was appointed , by the French government , General-in-Chief of the armies of St. Domingo , and , as such , signed the Convention with General Maitland for the evacuation of the island by the British . From this period , until 1801 , the island , under the government of Toussaint , was happy , tranquil , and prosperous . The miserable attempt of Napoleon to re-establish slavery in St. Domingo , although it failed of its intended object , proved fatal to the negro chieftain . Treacherously seized by Leclerc , he was hurried on board a vessel by night , and conveyed to France , where he was confined in a cold subterranean dungeon , at Besancon , where , in April , 1803 , he died . The treatment of Toussaint finds a parallel only in the murder of the Duke D'Enghien . It was the remark of Godwin , in his Lectures , that the West India Islands , since their first discovery by Columbus , could not boast of a single name which deserves comparison with that of Toussaint L'Ouverture .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">‘ T WAS night . The tranquil moonlight smile</l>
     <l n="2">With which Heaven dreams of Earth , shed down</l>
     <l n="3">Its beauty on the Indian isle ,—</l>
     <l n="4">On broad green field and white-walled town ;</l>
     <l n="5">And inland waste of rock and wood ,</l>
     <l n="6">In searching sunshine , wild and rude ,</l>
     <l n="7">Rose , mellowed through the silver gleam ,</l>
     <l n="8">Soft as the landscape of a dream .</l>
     <l n="9">All motionless and dewy wet ,</l>
     <l n="10">Tree , vine , and flower in shadow met</l>
     <l n="11">The myrtle with its snowy bloom ,</l>
     <l n="12">Crossing the nightshade 's solemn gloom ,—</l>
     <l n="13">The white cecropia 's silver rind</l>
     <l n="14">Relieved by deeper green behind ,</l>
     <l n="15">The orange with its fruit of gold ,</l>
     <l n="16">The lithe paullinia 's verdant fold ,</l>
     <l n="17">The passion-flower , with symbol holy ,</l>
     <l n="18">Twining its tendrils long and lowly ,</l>
     <l n="19">The rhexias dark , and cassia tall ,</l>
     <l n="20">And proudly rising over all ,</l>
     <l n="21">The kingly palm 's imperial stem ,</l>
     <l n="22">Crowned with its leafy diadem ,</l>
     <l n="23">Star-like , beneath whose sombre shade ,</l>
     <l n="24">The fiery-winged cucullo played !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="25">How lovely was thine aspect , then ,</l>
     <l n="26">Fair island of the Western Sea</l>
     <l n="27">Lavish of beauty , even when</l>
     <l n="28">Thy brutes were happier than thy men ,</l>
     <l n="29">For they , at least , were free !</l>
     <l n="30">Regardless of thy glorious clime ,</l>
     <l n="31">Unmindful of thy soil of flowers ,</l>
     <l n="32">The toiling negro sighed , that Time</l>
     <l n="33">No faster sped his hours .</l>
     <l n="34">For , by the dewy moonlight still ,</l>
     <l n="35">He fed the weary-turning mill ,</l>
     <l n="36">Or bent him in the chill morass ,</l>
     <l n="37">To pluck the long and tangled grass ,</l>
     <l n="38">And hear above his scar-worn back</l>
     <l n="39">The heavy slave-whip 's frequent crack</l>
     <l n="40">While in his heart one evil thought</l>
     <l n="41">In solitary madness wrought ,</l>
     <l n="42">One baleful fire surviving still</l>
     <l n="43">The quenching of the immortal mind ,</l>
     <l n="44">One sterner passion of his kind ,</l>
     <l n="45">Which even fetters could not kill ,</l>
     <l n="46">The savage hope , to deal , erelong ,</l>
     <l n="47">A vengeance bitterer than his wrong !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="48">Hark to that cry ! long , loud , and shrill ,</l>
     <l n="49">From field and forest , rock and hill ,</l>
     <l n="50">Thrilling and horrible it rang ,</l>
     <l n="51">Around , beneath , above ;</l>
     <l n="52">The wild beast from his cavern sprang ,</l>
     <l n="53">The wild bird from her grove !</l>
     <l n="54">Nor fear , nor joy , nor agony</l>
     <l n="55">Were mingled in that midnight cry ;</l>
     <l n="56">But like the lion 's growl of wrath ,</l>
     <l n="57">When falls that hunter in his path</l>
     <l n="58">Whose barbed arrow , deeply set ,</l>
     <l n="59">Is rankling in his bosom yet ,</l>
     <l n="60">It told of hate , full , deep , and strong ,</l>
     <l n="61">Of vengeance kindling out of wrong ;</l>
     <l n="62">It was as if the crimes of years —</l>
     <l n="63">The unrequited toil , the tears ,</l>
     <l n="64">The shame and hate , which liken well</l>
     <l n="65">Earth 's garden to the nether hell —</l>
     <l n="66">Had found in nature 's self a tongue ,</l>
     <l n="67">On which the gathered horror hung ;</l>
     <l n="68">As if from cliff , and stream , and glen</l>
     <l n="69">Burst on the ’ startled ears of men</l>
     <l n="70">That voice which rises unto God ,</l>
     <l n="71">Solemn and stern ,— the cry of blood !</l>
     <l n="72">It ceased , and all was still once more ,</l>
     <l n="73">Save ocean chafing on his shore ,</l>
     <l n="74">The sighing of the wind between</l>
     <l n="75">The broad banana 's leaves of green ,</l>
     <l n="76">Or bough by restless plumage shook ,</l>
     <l n="77">Or murmuring voice of mountain brook .</l>
     <l n="78">Brief was the silence . Once again</l>
     <l n="79">Pealed to the skies that frantic yell ,</l>
     <l n="80">Glowed on the heavens a fiery stain ,</l>
     <l n="81">And flashes rose and fell ;</l>
     <l n="82">And painted on the blood-red sky ,</l>
     <l n="83">Dark , naked arms were tossed on high ;</l>
     <l n="84">And , round the white man 's lordly hall ,</l>
     <l n="85">Trod , fierce and free , the brute he made ;</l>
     <l n="86">And those who crept along the wall ,</l>
     <l n="87">And answered to his lightest call</l>
     <l n="88">With more than spaniel dread ,</l>
     <l n="89">The creatures of his lawless beck ,</l>
     <l n="90">Were trampling on his very neck</l>
     <l n="91">And on the night-air , wild and clear ,</l>
     <l n="92">Rose woman 's shriek of more than fear ;</l>
     <l n="93">For bloodied arms were round her thrown ,</l>
     <l n="94">And dark cheeks pressed against her own !</l>
     <l n="95">Where then was he whose fiery zeal</l>
     <l n="96">Had taught the trampled heart to feel ,</l>
     <l n="97">Until despair itself grew strong ,</l>
     <l n="98">And vengeance fed its torch from wrong ?</l>
     <l n="99">Now , when the thunderbolt is speeding ;</l>
     <l n="100">Now , when oppression 's heart is bleeding ;</l>
     <l n="101">Now , when the latent curse of Time</l>
     <l n="102">Is raining down in fire and blood ,</l>
     <l n="103">That curse which , through long years of crime ,</l>
     <l n="104">Has gathered , drop by drop , its flood ,—</l>
     <l n="105">Why strikes he not , the foremost one ,</l>
     <l n="106">Where murder 's sternest deeds are done ?</l>

     <l n="107">He stood the aged palms beneath ,</l>

     <l n="110">To the wild sounds of fear and death ,</l>
     <l n="111">Toussaint L'Ouverture !</l>
     <l n="112">What marvel that his heart beat high !</l>
     <l n="113">The blow for freedom had been given ,</l>
     <l n="114">And blood had answered to the cry</l>
     <l n="115">Which Earth sent up to Heaven !</l>
     <l n="116">What marvel that a fierce delight</l>
     <l n="117">Smiled grimly o'er his brow of night ,</l>
     <l n="118">As groan and shout and bursting flame</l>
     <l n="119">Told where the midnight tempest came ,</l>
     <l n="120">With blood and fire along its van ,</l>

   <p>“ The French ship Le Rodeur , with a crew of twenty-two men , and with one hundred and sixty negro slaves , sailed from Bonny , in Africa , April , 1819 . On approaching the line , a terrible malady broke out ,— an obstinate disease of the eyes ,— contagious , and altogether beyond the resources of medicine . It was aggravated by the scarcity of water among the slaves ( only half a wine-glass per day being allowed to an individual ) , and by the extreme impurity of the air in which they breathed . By the advice of the physician , they were brought upon deck occasionally ; but some of the poor wretches , locking themselves in each other 's arms , leaped overboard , in the hope , which so universally prevails among them , of being swiftly transported to their own homes in Africa . To check this , the captain ordered several who were stopped in the attempt to be shot , or hanged , before their companions . The disease extended to the crew ; and one after another were smitten with it , until only one remained unaffected . Yet even this dreadful condition did not preclude calculation : to save the expense of supporting slaves rendered unsalable , and to obtain grounds for a claim against the underwriters , thirty-six of the negroes , having become blind , were thrown into the sea and drowned ! ” Speech of M. Benjamin Constant , in the French Chamber of Deputies , June 17 , 1820 .</p>
   <p>In the midst of their dreadful fears lest the solitary individual , whose sight remained unaffected , should also be seized with the malady , a sail was discovered . It was the Spanish slaver , Leon . The same disease had been there ; and , horrible to tell , all the crew had become blind ! Unable to assist each other , the vessels parted . The Spanish ship has never since been heard of . The Rodeur reached Guadaloupe on the 21st of June ; the only man who had escaped the disease , and had thus been enabled to steer the slaver into port , caught it in three days after its arrival .— Bibliotheque Ophthalmologique for November , 1819 .</p>

   <p>EXPOSTULATION .</p>
   <p>Dr. Charles Follen , a German patriot , who had come to America for the freedom which was denied him in his native land , allied himself with the abolitionists , and at a convention of delegates from all the anti - slavery organizations in New England , held at Boston in May , 1834 , was chairman of a committee to prepare an address to the people of New England . Toward the close of the address occurred the passage which suggested these lines . “ The despotism which our fathers could not bear in their native country is expiring , and the sword of justice in her reformed hands has applied its exterminating edge to slavery . Shall the United States — the free United States , which could not bear the bonds of a king — cradle the bondage which a king is abolishing ? Shall a Republic be less free than a Monarchy ? Shall we , in the vigor and buoyancy of our manhood , be less energetic in righteousness than a kingdom in its age ? ” — Dr. Follen 's Address .</p>
   <p>“ Genius of America !— Spirit of our free institutions !— where art thou ? How art thou fallen , O Lucifer ! son of the morning ,— how art thou fallen from Heaven ! Hell from beneath is moved for thee , to meet thee at thy coming ! The kings of the earth cry out to thee , Aha ! Aha ! Art thou become like unto us ? ” — Speech of Samuel J . May .</p>

   <p>Written on the adoption of Pinckney 's Resolutions in the House of Representatives , and the passage of Calhoun 's “ Bill for excluding Papers written or printed , touching the subject of Slavery , from the U. S. Post-office , ” in the Senate of the United States . Mr. Pinckney 's resolutions were in brief that Congress had no authority to interfere in any way with slavery in the States ; that it ought not to interfere with it in the District of Columbia , and that all resolutions to that end should be laid on the table without printing . Mr. Calhoun 's bill made it a penal offence for post-masters in any State , District , or Territory “ knowingly to deliver , to any person whatever , any pamphlet , newspaper , handbill , or other printed paper or pictorial representation , touching the subject of slavery , where , by the laws of the said State , District , or Territory , their circulation was prohibited . ”</p>

  <p>THE PASTORAL LETTER</p>
   <p>The General Association of Congregational ministers in Massachusetts met at Brookfield , June 27 , 1837 , and issued a Pastoral Letter to the churches under its care . The immediate occasion of it was the profound sensation produced by the recent public lecture in Massachusetts by Angelina and Sarah Grimke , two noble women from South Carolina , who bore their testimony against slavery . The Letter demanded that “ the perplexed and agitating subjects which are now common amongst us ... should not be forced upon any church as matters for debate , at the hazard of alienation and division , ” and called attention to the dangers now seeming “ to threaten the female character with widespread and permanent injury . ”</p>

    <head>PENNSYLVANIA HALL .</head>
    <head>Read at the dedication of Pennsylvania Hall , Philadelphia , May 15 , 1838 . The building was erected by an association of gentlemen , irrespective of sect or party , “ that the citizens of Philadelphia should possess a room wherein the principles of Liberty , and Equality of Civil Rights , could be freely discussed , and the evils of slavery fearlessly portrayed . ” On the evening of the 17th it was burned by a mob , destroying the office of the Pennsylvania Freeman , of which I was editor , and with it my books and papers .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">NOT with the splendors of the days of old ,</l>
     <l n="2">The spoil of nations , and barbaric gold ;</l>
     <l n="3">No weapons wrested from the fields of blood ,</l>
     <l n="4">Where dark and stern the unyielding Roman stood ,</l>
     <l n="5">And the proud eagles of his cohorts saw</l>
     <l n="6">A world , war-wasted , crouching to his law ;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="7">Nor blazoned car , nor banners floating gay ,</l>
     <l n="8">Like those which swept along the Appian Way ,</l>
     <l n="9">When , to the welcome of imperial Rome ,</l>
     <l n="10">The victor warrior came in triumph home ,</l>
     <l n="11">And trumpet peal , and shoutings wild and high ,</l>
     <l n="12">Stirred the blue quiet of the Italian sky ;</l>
     <l n="13">But calm and grateful , prayerful and sincere ,</l>
     <l n="14">As Christian freemen only , gathering here ,</l>
     <l n="15">We dedicate our fair and lofty Hall ,</l>
     <l n="16">Pillar and arch , entablature and wall ,</l>
     <l n="17">As Virtue 's shrine , as Liberty 's abode ,</l>
     <l n="18">Sacred to Freedom , and to Freedom 's God</l>
     <l n="19">Far statelier Halls , ‘ neath brighter skies than these ,</l>
     <l n="20">Stood darkly mirrored in the AEgean seas ,</l>
     <l n="21">Pillar and shrine , and life-like statues seen ,</l>
     <l n="22">Graceful and pure , the marble shafts between ;</l>
     <l n="23">Where glorious Athens from her rocky hill</l>
     <l n="24">Saw Art and Beauty subject to her will ;</l>
     <l n="25">And the chaste temple , and the classic grove ,</l>
     <l n="26">The hall of sages , and the bowers of love ,</l>
     <l n="27">Arch , fane , and column , graced the shores , and gave</l>
     <l n="28">Their shadows to the blue Saronic wave ;</l>
     <l n="29">And statelier rose , on Tiber 's winding side ,</l>
     <l n="30">The Pantheon 's dome , the Coliseum 's pride ,</l>
     <l n="31">The Capitol , whose arches backward flung</l>
     <l n="32">The deep , clear cadence of the Roman tongue ,</l>
     <l n="33">Whence stern decrees , like words of fate , went forth</l>
     <l n="34">To the awed nations of a conquered earth ,</l>
     <l n="35">Where the proud Caesars in their glory came ,</l>
     <l n="36">And Brutus lightened from his lips of flame !</l>
     <l n="37">Yet in the porches of Athena 's halls ,</l>
     <l n="38">And in the shadow of her stately walls ,</l>
     <l n="39">Lurked the sad bondman , and his tears of woe</l>
     <l n="40">Wet the cold marble with unheeded flow ;</l>
     <l n="41">And fetters clanked beneath the silver dome</l>
     <l n="42">Of the proud Pantheon of imperious Rome .</l>
     <l n="43">Oh , not for hint , the chained and stricken slave ,</l>
     <l n="44">By Tiber 's shore , or blue AEgina 's wave ,</l>
     <l n="45">In the thronged forum , or the sages ’ seat ,</l>
     <l n="46">The bold lip pleaded , and the warm heart beat ;</l>
     <l n="47">No soul of sorrow melted at his pain ,</l>
     <l n="48">No tear of pity rusted on his chain !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="49">But this fair Hall to Truth and Freedom given ,</l>
     <l n="50">Pledged to the Right before all Earth and Heaven ,</l>
     <l n="51">A free arena for the strife of mind ,</l>
     <l n="52">To caste , or sect , or color unconfined ,</l>
     <l n="53">Shall thrill with echoes such as ne'er of old</l>
     <l n="54">From Roman hall or Grecian temple rolled ;</l>
     <l n="55">Thoughts shall find utterance such as never yet</l>
     <l n="56">The Propylea or the Forum met .</l>
     <l n="57">Beneath its roof no gladiator 's strife</l>
     <l n="58">Shall win applauses with the waste of life ;</l>
     <l n="59">No lordly lictor urge the barbarous game ,</l>
     <l n="60">No wanton Lais glory in her shame .</l>
     <l n="61">But here the tear of sympathy shall flow ,</l>
     <l n="62">As the ear listens to the tale of woe ;</l>
     <l n="63">Here in stern judgment of the oppressor 's wrong</l>
     <l n="64">Shall strong rebukings thrill on Freedom 's tongue ,</l>
     <l n="65">No partial justice hold th ’ unequal scale ,</l>
     <l n="66">No pride of caste a brother 's rights assail ,</l>
     <l n="67">No tyrant 's mandates echo from this wall ,</l>
     <l n="68">Holy to Freedom and the Rights of All !</l>
     <l n="69">But a fair field , where mind may close with mind ,</l>
     <l n="70">Free as the sunshine and the chainless wind ;</l>
     <l n="71">Where the high trust is fixed on Truth alone ,</l>
     <l n="72">And bonds and fetters from the soul are thrown ;</l>
     <l n="73">Where wealth , and rank , and worldly pomp , and might ,</l>
     <l n="74">Yield to the presence of the True and Right .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="75">And fitting is it that this Hall should stand</l>
     <l n="76">Where Pennsylvania 's Founder led his band ,</l>
     <l n="77">From thy blue waters , Delaware !— to press</l>
     <l n="78">The virgin verdure of the wilderness .</l>
     <l n="79">Here , where all Europe with amazement saw</l>
     <l n="80">The soul 's high freedom trammelled by no law ;</l>
     <l n="81">Here , where the fierce and warlike forest-men</l>
     <l n="82">Gathered , in peace , around the home of Penn ,</l>
     <l n="83">Awed by the weapons Love alone had given</l>
     <l n="84">Drawn from the holy armory of Heaven ;</l>
     <l n="85">Where Nature 's voice against the bondman 's wrong</l>
     <l n="86">First found an earnest and indignant tongue ;</l>
     <l n="87">Where Lay 's bold message to the proud was borne ;</l>
     <l n="88">And Keith 's rebuke , and Franklin 's manly scorn !</l>
     <l n="89">Fitting it is that here , where Freedom first</l>
     <l n="90">From her fair feet shook off the Old World 's dust ,</l>
     <l n="91">Spread her white pinions to our Western blast ,</l>
     <l n="92">And her free tresses to our sunshine cast ,</l>
     <l n="93">One Hall should rise redeemed from Slavery 's ban ,</l>
     <l n="94">One Temple sacred to the Rights of Man !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="95">Oh ! if the spirits of the parted come ,</l>
     <l n="96">Visiting angels , to their olden home</l>
     <l n="97">If the dead fathers of the land look forth</l>
     <l n="98">From their fair dwellings , to the things of earth ,</l>
     <l n="99">Is it a dream , that with their eyes of love ,</l>
     <l n="100">They gaze now on us from the bowers above ?</l>
     <l n="101">Lay 's ardent soul , and Benezet the mild ,</l>
     <l n="102">Steadfast in faith , yet gentle as a child ,</l>
     <l n="103">Meek-hearted Woolman , and that brother-band ,</l>
     <l n="104">The sorrowing exiles from their “ Father land , ”</l>
     <l n="105">Leaving their homes in Krieshiem 's bowers of vine ,</l>
     <l n="106">And the blue beauty of their glorious Rhine ,</l>
     <l n="107">To seek amidst our solemn depths of wood</l>
     <l n="108">Freedom from man , and holy peace with God ;</l>
     <l n="109">Who first of all their testimonial gave</l>
     <l n="110">Against the oppressor , for the outcast slave ,</l>
     <l n="111">Is it a dream that such as these look down ,</l>
     <l n="112">And with their blessing our rejoicings crown ?</l>
     <l n="113">Let us rejoice , that while the pulpit 's door</l>
     <l n="114">Is barred against the pleaders for the poor ;</l>
     <l n="115">While the Church , wrangling upon points of faith ,</l>
     <l n="116">Forgets her bondmen suffering unto death ;</l>
     <l n="117">While crafty Traffic and the lust of Gain</l>
     <l n="118">Unite to forge Oppression 's triple chain ,</l>
     <l n="119">One door is open , and one Temple free ,</l>
     <l n="120">As a resting-place for hunted Liberty !</l>
     <l n="121">Where men may speak , unshackled and unawed ,</l>
     <l n="122">High words of Truth , for Freedom and for God .</l>
     <l n="123">And when that truth its perfect work hath done ,</l>
     <l n="124">And rich with blessings o'er our land hath gone ;</l>
     <l n="125">When not a slave beneath his yoke shall pine ,</l>
     <l n="126">From broad Potomac to the far Sabine</l>
     <l n="127">When unto angel lips at last is given</l>
     <l n="128">The silver trump of Jubilee in Heaven ;</l>
     <l n="129">And from Virginia 's plains , Kentucky 's shades ,</l>
     <l n="130">And through the dim Floridian everglades ,</l>
     <l n="131">Rises , to meet that angel-trumpet 's sound ,</l>
     <l n="132">The voice of millions from their chains unbound ;</l>
     <l n="133">Then , though this Hall be crumbling in decay ,</l>
     <l n="134">Its strong walls blending with the common clay ,</l>
     <l n="135">Yet , round the ruins of its strength shall stand</l>
     <l n="136">The best and noblest of a ransomed land —</l>
     <l n="137">Pilgrims , like these who throng around the shrine</l>
     <l n="138">Of Mecca , or of holy Palestine !</l>
     <l n="139">A prouder glory shall that ruin own</l>
     <l n="140">Than that which lingers round the Parthenon .</l>
     <l n="141">Here shall the child of after years be taught</l>
     <l n="142">The works of Freedom which his fathers wrought ;</l>
     <l n="143">Told of the trials of the present hour ,</l>
     <l n="144">Our weary strife with prejudice and power ;</l>
     <l n="145">How the high errand quickened woman 's soul ,</l>
     <l n="146">And touched her lip as with a living coal ;</l>
     <l n="147">How Freedom 's martyrs kept their lofty faith</l>
     <l n="148">True and unwavering , unto bonds and death ;</l>
     <l n="149">The pencil 's art shall sketch the ruined Hall ,</l>
     <l n="150">The Muses ’ garland crown its aged wall ,</l>
     <l n="151">And History 's pen for after times record</l>
     <l n="152">Its consecration unto Freedom 's God !</l>

    <head>MASSACHUSETTS TO VIRGINIA .</head>
    <head>Written on reading an account of the proceedings of the citizens of Norfolk , Va ., in reference to George Latimer , the alleged fugitive slave , who was seized in Boston without warrant at the request of James B. Grey , of Norfolk , claiming to be his master . The case caused great excitement North and South , and led to the presentation of a petition to Congress , signed by more than fifty thousand citizens of Massachusetts , calling for such laws and proposed amendments to the Constitution as should relieve the Commonwealth from all further participation in the crime of oppression . George Latimer himself was finally given free papers for the sum of four hundred dollars .</head>

   <p>THE SENTENCE OF JOHN L. BROWN .</p>
   <p>John L. Brown , a young white man of South Carolina , was in 1844 sentenced to death for aiding a young slave woman , whom he loved and had married , to escape from slavery . In pronouncing the sentence Judge O'Neale addressed to the prisoner these words of appalling blasphemy :</p>
   <p>You are to die ! To die an ignominious death — the death on the gallows ! This announcement is , to you , I know , most appalling . Little did you dream of it when you stepped into the bar with an air as if you thought it was a fine frolic . But the consequences of crime are just such as you are realizing . Punishment often comes when it is least expected . Let me entreat you to take the present opportunity to commence the work of reformation . Time will be furnished you to prepare for the great change just before you . Of your past life I know nothing , except what your trial furnished . That told me that the crime for which you are to suffer was the consequence of a want of attention on your part to the duties of life . The strange woman snared you . She flattered you with her word ; and you became her victim . The consequence was , that , led on by a desire to serve her , you committed the offence of aid in a slave to run away and depart from her master 's service ; and now , for it you are to die ! You are a young man , and I fear you have been dissolute ; and if so , these kindred vices have contributed a full measure to your ruin . Reflect on your past life , and make the only useful devotion of the remnant of your days in preparing for death . Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth is the language of inspired wisdom . This comes home appropriately to you in this trying moment . You are young ; quite too young to be where you are . If you had remembered your Creator in your past days , you would not now be in a felon 's place , to receive a felon 's judgment . Still , it is not too late to remember your Creator . He calls early , and He calls late . He stretches out the arms of a Father 's love to you — to the vilest sinner — and says : “ Come unto me and be saved . ” You can perhaps read . If so , read the Scriptures ; read them without note , and without comment ; and pray to God for His assistance ; and you will be able to say when you pass from prison to execution , as a poor slave said under similar circumstances : “ I am glad my Friday has come . ” If you cannot read the Scriptures , the ministers of our holy religion will be ready to aid you . They will read and explain to you until you will be able to understand ; and understanding , to call upon the only One who can help you and save you — Jesus Christ , the Lamb of God , who taketh away the sin of the world . To Him I commend you . And through Him may you have that opening of the Day-Spring of mercy from on high , which shall bless you here , and crown you as a saint in an everlasting world , forever and ever . The sentence of the law is that you be taken hence to the place from whence you came last ; thence to the jail of Fairfield District ; and that there you be closely and securely confined until Friday , the 26th day of April next ; on which day , between the hours of ten in the forenoon and two in the afternoon , you will be taken to the place of public execution , and there be hanged by the neck till your body be dead . And may God have mercy on your soul !</p>
   <p>No event in the history of the anti-slavery struggle so stirred the two hemispheres as did this dreadful sentence . A cry of horror was heard from Europe . In the British House of Lords , Brougham and Denman spoke of it with mingled pathos and indignation . Thirteen hundred clergymen and church officers in Great Britain addressed a memorial to the churches of South Carolina against the atrocity . Indeed , so strong was the pressure of the sentiment of abhorrence and disgust that South Carolina yielded to it , and the sentence was commuted to scourging and banishment .</p>

    <head>TO A SOUTHERN STATESMAN .</head>
    <head>John C. Calhoun , who had strongly urged the extension of slave territory by the annexation of Texas , even if it should involve a war with England , was unwilling to promote the acquisition of Oregon , which would enlarge the Northern domain of freedom , and pleaded as an excuse the peril of foreign complications which he had defied when the interests of slavery were involved .</head>

     <l n="4">Spurning the leash , and leaping o'er their bounds ?</l>
     <l n="5">Sore-baffled statesman ! when thy eager hand ,</l>

Although well aware of the great hazard of the enterprise he attempted to comply with the request , but was seized at sea by an American vessel , consigned to the authorities at Key West , and thence sent back to Pensacola , where , after a long and rigorous confinement in prison , he was tried and sentenced to be branded on his right hand with the letters “ S. S . ” ( slave-stealer ) and amerced in a heavy fine .</head>
     <l n="1">WELCOME home again , brave seaman ! with thy</l>
     <l n="2">thoughtful brow and gray ,</l>
     <l n="3">And the old heroic spirit of our earlier , better day ;</l>
     <l n="4">With that front of calm endurance , on whose</l>
     <l n="5">steady nerve in vain</l>
     <l n="6">Pressed the iron of the prison , smote the fiery</l>
     <l n="7">shafts of pain .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Is the tyrant 's brand upon thee ? Did the brutal cravens aim To make God 's truth thy falsehood , His holiest work thy shame ? When , all blood-quenched , from the torture the iron was withdrawn , How laughed their evil angel the baffled fools to scorn !</p>
   <p>They change to wrong the duty which God hath written out On the great heart of humanity , too legible for doubt ! They , the loathsome moral lepers , blotched from footsole up to crown , Give to shame what God hath given unto honor and renown !</p>
   <p>Why , that brand is highest honor ! than its traces never yet Upon old armorial hatchments was a prouder blazon set ; And thy unborn generations , as they tread our rocky strand , Shall tell with pride the story of their father 's branded hand !</p>

   <p>For , while the jurist , sitting with the slave-whip o'er him swung , From the tortured truths of freedom the lie of slavery wrung , And the solemn priest to Moloch , on each God - deserted shrine , Broke the bondman 's heart for bread , poured the bondman 's blood for wine ;</p>

     <l n="6">shadows dim ,</l>
     <l n="7">And thy mercy to the bondman , it was mercy unto Him !</l>
   </lg>
   <p>In thy lone and long night-watches , sky above and wave below , Thou didst learn a higher wisdom than the babbling schoolmen know ; God 's stars and silence taught thee , as His angels only can , That the one sole sacred thing beneath the cope of heaven is Man !</p>

   <p>Then lift that manly right-hand , bold ploughman of the wave ! Its branded palm shall prophesy , “ Salvation to the Slave ! ” Hold up its fire-wrought language , that whoso reads may feel His heart swell strong within him , his sinews change to steel .</p>

    <head>A LETTER .</head>
    <head>Supposed to be written by the chairman of the “ Central Clique ” at Concord , N. H ., to the Hon . M. N ., Jr ., at Washington , giving the result of the election . The following verses were published in the Boston Chronotype in 1846 . They refer to the contest in New Hampshire , which resulted in the defeat of the pro-slavery Democracy , and in the election of John P. Hale to the United States Senate . Although their authorship was not acknowledged , it was strongly suspected . They furnish a specimen of the way , on the whole rather good-natured , in which the liberty-lovers of half a century ago answered the social and political outlawry and mob violence to which they were subjected .</head>

   <p>Dr. Neall , a worthy disciple of that venerated philanthropist , Warner Mifflin , whom the Girondist statesman , Jean Pierre Brissot , pronounced “ an angel of mercy , the best man he ever knew , ” was one of the noble band of Pennsylvania abolitionists , whose bravery was equalled only by their gentleness and tenderness . He presided at the great anti-slavery meeting in Pennsylvania Hall , May 17 , 1838 , when the Hall was surrounded by a furious mob . I was standing near him while the glass of the windows broken by missiles showered over him , and a deputation from the rioters forced its way to the platform , and demanded that the meeting should be closed at once . Dr. Neall drew up his tall form to its utmost height . “ I am here , ” he said , “ the president of this meeting , and I will be torn in pieces before I leave my place at your dictation . Go back to those who sent you . I shall do my duty . ” Some years after , while visiting his relatives in his native State of Delaware , he was dragged from the house of his friends by a mob of slave-holders and brutally maltreated . He bore it like a martyr of the old times ; and when released , told his persecutors that he forgave them , for it was not they but Slavery which had done the wrong . If they should ever be in Philadelphia and needed hospitality or aid , let them call on him .</p>
   <p>I . FRIEND of the Slave , and yet the friend of all ; Lover of peace , yet ever foremost when The need of battling Freedom called for men To plant the banner on the outer wall ; Gentle and kindly , ever at distress Melted to more than woman 's tenderness , Yet firm and steadfast , at his duty 's post Fronting the violence of a maddened host , Like some gray rock from which the waves are tossed ! Knowing his deeds of love , men questioned not The faith of one whose walk and word were right ; Who tranquilly in Life 's great task-field wrought , And , side by side with evil , scarcely caught A stain upon his pilgrim garb of white Prompt to redress another 's wrong , his own Leaving to Time and Truth and Penitence alone .</p>
   <p>II . Such was our friend . Formed on the good old plan , A true and brave and downright honest man He blew no trumpet in the market-place , Nor in the church with hypocritic face Supplied with cant the lack of Christian grace ; Loathing pretence , he did with cheerful will What others talked of while their hands were still ; And , while “ Lord , Lord ! ” the pious tyrants cried , Who , in the poor , their Master crucified , His daily prayer , far better understood In acts than words , was simply doing good . So calm , so constant was his rectitude , That by his loss alone we know its worth , And feel how true a man has walked with us on earth .</p>

   <p>SONG OF SLAVES IN THE DESERT .</p>
   <p>“ Sebah , Oasis of Fezzan , 10th March , 1846 .— This evening the female slaves were unusually excited in singing , and I had the curiosity to ask my negro servant , Said , what they were singing about . As many of them were natives of his own country , he had no difficulty in translating the Mandara or Bornou language . I had often asked the Moors to translate their songs for me , but got no satisfactory account from them . Said at first said , ‘ Oh , they sing of Rubee ’ ( God ) . ‘ What do you mean ? ’ I replied , impatiently . ‘ Oh , do n't you know ? ’ he continued , ‘ they asked God to give them their Atka ? ’ ( certificate of freedom ) . I inquired , ‘ Is that all ? ’ Said : ‘ No ; they say , “ Where are we going ? The world is large . O God ! Where are we going ? O God ! " ’ I inquired , ‘ What else ? ’ Said : ‘ They remember their country , Bornou , and say , “ Bornou was a pleasant country , full of all good things ; but this is a bad country , and we are miserable ! " ’ ‘ Do they say anything else ? ’ Said : ‘ No ; they repeat these words over and over again , and add , “ O God ! give us our Atka , and let us return again to our dear home . " ’</p>
   <p>“ I am not surprised I got little satisfaction when I asked the Moors about the songs of their slaves . Who will say that the above words are not a very appropriate song ? What could have been more congenially adapted to their then woful condition ? It is not to be wondered at that these poor bondwomen cheer up their hearts , in their long , lonely , and painful wanderings over the desert , with words and sentiments like these ; but I have often observed that their fatigue and sufferings were too great for them to strike up this melancholy dirge , and many days their plaintive strains never broke over the silence of the desert . ” — Richardson 's Journal in Africa .</p>

    <head>YORKTOWN .</head>
    <head>Dr. Thacher , surgeon in Scammel 's regiment , in his description of the siege of Yorktown , says : “ The labor on the Virginia plantations is performed altogether by a species of the human race cruelly wrested from their native country , and doomed to perpetual bondage , while their masters are manfully contending for freedom and the natural rights of man . Such is the inconsistency of human nature . ” Eighteen hundred slaves were found at Yorktown , after its surrender , and restored to their masters . Well was it said by Dr. Barnes , in his late work on Slavery : “ No slave was any nearer his freedom after the surrender of Yorktown than when Patrick Henry first taught the notes of liberty to echo among the hills and vales of Virginia . ”</head>

    <head>THE SLAVES OF MARTINIQUE .</head>
     <l n="1">Suggested by a daguerreotype taken from a small French engraving of two</l>
     <l n="2">negro figures , sent to the writer by Oliver Johnson .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>BEAMS of noon , like burning lances , through the tree-tops flash and glisten , As she stands before her lover , with raised face to look and listen .</p>
   <p>Dark , but comely , like the maiden in the ancient Jewish song Scarcely has the toil of task-fields done her graceful beauty wrong .</p>
   <p>He , the strong one and the manly , with the vassal 's garb and hue , Holding still his spirit 's birthright , to his higher nature true ;</p>
   <p>Hiding deep the strengthening purpose of a freeman in his heart , As the gregree holds his Fetich from the white man 's gaze apart .</p>
   <p>Ever foremost of his comrades , when the driver 's morning horn Calls away to stifling mill-house , to the fields of cane and corn .</p>
   <p>Fall the keen and burning lashes never on his back or limb ; Scarce with look or word of censure , turns the driver unto him .</p>
   <p>Yet , his brow is always thoughtful , and his eye is hard and stern ; Slavery 's last and humblest lesson he has never deigned to learn .</p>
   <p>And , at evening , when his comrades dance before their master 's door , Folding arms and knitting forehead , stands he silent evermore .</p>
   <p>God be praised for every instinct which rebels against a lot Where the brute survives the human , and man 's upright form is not !</p>
   <p>As the serpent-like bejuco winds his spiral fold on fold Round the tall and stately ceiba , till it withers in his hold ;</p>
   <p>Slow decays the forest monarch , closer girds the fell embrace , Till the tree is seen no longer , and the vine is in its place ;</p>
   <p>So a base and bestial nature round the vassal 's manhood twines , And the spirit wastes beneath it , like the ceiba choked with vines .</p>
   <p>God is Love , saith the Evangel ; and our world of woe and sin Is made light and happy only when a Love is shining in .</p>
   <p>Ye whose lives are free as sunshine , finding , where - soe'er ye roam , Smiles of welcome , looks of kindness , making all the world like home ;</p>
   <p>In the veins of whose affections kindred blood is but a part ., Of one kindly current throbbing from the universal heart ;</p>
   <p>Can ye know the deeper meaning of a love in Slavery nursed , Last flower of a lost Eden , blooming in that Soil accursed ?</p>
   <p>Love of Home , and Love of Woman !— dear to all , but doubly dear To the heart whose pulses elsewhere measure only hate and fear .</p>
   <p>All around the desert circles , underneath a brazen sky , Only one green spot remaining where the dew is never dry !</p>
   <p>From the horror of that desert , from its atmosphere of hell , Turns the fainting spirit thither , as the diver seeks his bell .</p>
   <p>‘ T is the fervid tropic noontime ; faint and low the sea-waves beat ; Hazy rise the inland mountains through the glimmer of the heat ,—</p>
   <p>Where , through mingled leaves and blossoms , arrowy sunbeams flash and glisten , Speaks her lover to the slave-girl , and she lifts her head to listen :—</p>
   <p>“ We shall live as slaves no longer ! Freedom 's hour is close at hand ! Rocks her bark upon the waters , rests the boat upon the strand !</p>
   <p>“ I have seen the Haytien Captain ; I have seen his swarthy crew , Haters of the pallid faces , to their race and color true .</p>
   <p>“ They have sworn to wait our coming till the night has passed its noon , And the gray and darkening waters roll above the sunken moon ! ”</p>
   <p>Oh , the blessed hope of freedom ! how with joy and glad surprise , For an instant throbs her bosom , for an instant beam her eyes !</p>
   <p>But she looks across the valley , where her mother 's hut is seen , Through the snowy bloom of coffee , and the lemon - leaves so green .</p>
   <p>And she answers , sad and earnest : “ It were wrong for thee to stay ; God hath heard thy prayer for freedom , and his finger points the way .</p>
   <p>“ Well I know with what endurance , for the sake of me and mine , Thou hast borne too long a burden never meant for souls like thine .</p>
   <p>“ Go ; and at the hour of midnight , when our last farewell is o'er , Kneeling on our place of parting , I will bless thee from the shore .</p>
   <p>“ But for me , my mother , lying on her sick-bed all the day , Lifts her weary head to watch me , coming through the twilight gray .</p>
   <p>“ Should I leave her sick and helpless , even freedom , shared with thee , Would be sadder far than bondage , lonely toil , and stripes to me .</p>
   <p>“ For my heart would die within me , and my brain would soon be wild ; I should hear my mother calling through the twilight for her child ! ”</p>
   <p>Blazing upward from the ocean , shines the sun of morning-time , Through the coffee-trees in blossom , and green hedges of the lime .</p>
   <p>Side by side , amidst the slave-gang , toil the lover and the maid ; Wherefore looks he o'er the waters , leaning forward on his spade ?</p>
   <p>Sadly looks he , deeply sighs he : ‘ t is the Haytien 's sail he sees , Like a white cloud of the mountains , driven seaward by the breeze .</p>
   <p>But his arm a light hand presses , and he hears a low voice call Hate of Slavery , hope of Freedom , Love is mightier than all .</p>

   <p>THE CURSE OF THE CHARTER-BREAKERS .</p>
   <p>The rights and liberties affirmed by Magna Charta were deemed of such importance , in the thirteenth century , that the Bishops , twice a year , with tapers burning , and in their pontifical robes , pronounced , in the presence of the king and the representatives of the estates of England , the greater excommunication against the infringer of that instrument . The imposing ceremony took place in the great Hall of Westminster . A copy of the curse , as pronounced in 1253 , declares that , “ by the authority of Almighty God , and the blessed Apostles and Martyrs , and all the saints in heaven , all those who violate the English liberties , and secretly or openly , by deed , word , or counsel , do make statutes , or observe then being made , against said liberties , are accursed and sequestered from the company of heaven and the sacraments of the Holy Church . ”</p>
   <p>William Penn , in his admirable political pamphlet , England 's Present Interest Considered , alluding to the curse of the Charter - breakers , says : “ I am no Roman Catholic , and little value their other curses ; yet I declare I would not for the world incur this curse , as every man deservedly doth , who offers violence to the fundamental freedom thereby repeated and confirmed . ”</p>

    <head>DERNE .</head>
    <head>The storming of the city of Derne , in 1805 , by General Eaton , at the head of nine Americans , forty Greeks , and a motley array of Turks and Arabs , was one of those feats of hardihood and daring which have in all ages attracted the admiration of the multitude . The higher and holier heroism of Christian self-denial and sacrifice , in the humble walks of private duty , is seldom so well appreciated .</head>

    <head>A SABBATH SCENE .</head>

    <head>MOLOCH IN STATE STREET .</head>
    <head>In a foot-note of the Report of the Senate of Massachusetts on the case of the arrest and return to bondage of the fugitive slave Thomas Sims it is stated that — “ It would have been impossible for the U. S. marshal thus successfully to have resisted the law of the State , without the assistance of the municipal authorities of Boston , and the countenance and support of a numerous , wealthy , and powerful body of citizens . It was in evidence that 1500 of the most wealthy and respectable citizens-merchants , bankers , and others — volunteered their services to aid the marshal on this occasion . . . . No watch was kept upon the doings of the marshal , and while the State officers slept , after the moon had gone down , in the darkest hour before daybreak , the accused was taken out of our jurisdiction by the armed police of the city of Boston . ”</head>

   <p>TO WILLIAM H. SEWARD .</p>
   <p>On the 12th of January , 1861 , Mr. Seward delivered in the Senate chamber a speech on The State of the Union , in which he urged the paramount duty of preserving the Union , and went as far as it was possible to go , without surrender of principles , in concessions to the Southern party , concluding his argument with these words : “ Having submitted my own opinions on this great crisis , it remains only to say , that I shall cheerfully lend to the government my best support in whatever prudent yet energetic efforts it shall make to preserve the public peace , and to maintain and preserve the Union ; advising , only , that it practise , as far as possible , the utmost moderation , forbearance , and conciliation .</p>
   <p>“ This Union has not yet accomplished what good for mankind was manifestly designed by Him who appoints the seasons and prescribes the duties of states and empires . No ; if it were cast down by faction to-day , it would rise again and re-appear in all its majestic proportions to-morrow . It is the only government that can stand here . Woe ! woe ! to the man that madly lifts his hand against it . It shall continue and endure ; and men , in after times , shall declare that this generation , which saved the Union from such sudden and unlooked-for dangers , surpassed in magnanimity even that one which laid its foundations in the eternal principles of liberty , justice , and humanity . ”</p>

    <head>TO JOHN C. FREMONT .</head>
    <head>On the 31st of August , 1861 , General Fremont , then in charge of the Western Department , issued a proclamation which contained a clause , famous as the first announcement of emancipation : “ The property , ” it declared , “ real and personal , of all persons in the State of Missouri , who shall take up arms against the United States , or who shall be directly proven to have taken active part with their enemies in the field , is declared to be confiscated to the public use ; and their slaves , if any they have , are hereby declared free men . ” Mr. Lincoln regarded the proclamation as premature and countermanded it , after vainly endeavoring to persuade Fremont of his own motion to revoke it .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">THY error , Fremont , simply was to act</l>
     <l n="2">A brave man 's part , without the statesman 's tact ,</l>
     <l n="3">And , taking counsel but of common sense ,</l>
     <l n="4">To strike at cause as well as consequence .</l>
     <l n="5">Oh , never yet since Roland wound his horn</l>
     <l n="6">At Roncesvalles , has a blast been blown</l>
     <l n="7">Far-heard , wide-echoed , startling as thine own ,</l>
     <l n="8">Heard from the van of freedom 's hope forlorn</l>
     <l n="9">It had been safer , doubtless , for the time ,</l>
     <l n="10">To flatter treason , and avoid offence</l>
     <l n="11">To that Dark Power whose underlying crime</l>
     <l n="12">Heaves upward its perpetual turbulence .</l>
     <l n="13">But if thine be the fate of all who break</l>
     <l n="14">The ground for truth 's seed , or forerun their years</l>
     <l n="15">Till lost in distance , or with stout hearts make</l>
     <l n="16">A lane for freedom through the level spears ,</l>
     <l n="17">Still take thou courage ! God has spoken through thee ,</l>
     <l n="18">Irrevocable , the mighty words , Be free !</l>
     <l n="19">The land shakes with them , and the slave 's dull ear</l>
     <l n="20">Turns from the rice-swamp stealthily to hear .</l>
     <l n="21">Who would recall them now must first arrest</l>
     <l n="22">The winds that blow down from the free Northwest ,</l>
     <l n="23">Ruffling the Gulf ; or like a scroll roll back</l>
     <l n="24">The Mississippi to its upper springs .</l>
     <l n="25">Such words fulfil their prophecy , and lack</l>
     <l n="26">But the full time to harden into things .</l>

    <head>BARBARA FRIETCHIE .</head>
    <head>This poem was written in strict conformity to the account of the incident as I had it from respectable and trustworthy sources . It has since been the subject of a good deal of conflicting testimony , and the story was probably incorrect in some of its details . It is admitted by all that Barbara Frietchie was no myth , but a worthy and highly esteemed gentlewoman , intensely loyal and a hater of the Slavery Rebellion , holding her Union flag sacred and keeping it with her Bible ; that when the Confederates halted before her house , and entered her dooryard , she denounced them in vigorous language , shook her cane in their faces , and drove them out ; and when General Burnside 's troops followed close upon Jackson 's , she waved her flag and cheered them . It is stated that May Qnantrell , a brave and loyal lady in another part of the city , did wave her flag in sight of the Confederates . It is possible that there has been a blending of the two incidents .</head>

    <head>THE GALLOWS .</head>
     <l n="1">Written on reading pamphlets published by clergymen against the</l>
     <l n="2">abolition of the gallows .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>I . THE suns of eighteen centuries have shone Since the Redeemer walked with man , and made The fisher 's boat , the cavern 's floor of stone , And mountain moss , a pillow for His head ; And He , who wandered with the peasant Jew , And broke with publicans the bread of shame , And drank with blessings , in His Father 's name , The water which Samaria 's outcast drew , Hath now His temples upon every shore , Altar and shrine and priest ; and incense dim Evermore rising , with low prayer and hymn , From lips which press the temple 's marble floor , Or kiss the gilded sign of the dread cross He bore .</p>
   <p>II . Yet as of old , when , meekly “ doing good , ” He fed a blind and selfish multitude , And even the poor companions of His lot With their dim earthly vision knew Him not , How ill are His high teachings understood Where He hath spoken Liberty , the priest At His own altar binds the chain anew ; Where He hath bidden to Life 's equal feast , The starving many wait upon the few ; Where He hath spoken Peace , His name hath been The loudest war-cry of contending men ; Priests , pale with vigils , in His name have blessed The unsheathed sword , and laid the spear in rest , Wet the war-banner with their sacred wine , And crossed its blazon with the holy sign ; Yea , in His name who bade the erring live , And daily taught His lesson , to forgive ! Twisted the cord and edged the murderous steel ; And , with His words of mercy on their lips , Hung gloating o'er the pincer 's burning grips , And the grim horror of the straining wheel ; Fed the slow flame which gnawed the victim 's limb , Who saw before his searing eyeballs swim The image of their Christ in cruel zeal , Through the black torment-smoke , held mockingly to him !</p>
   <p>III . The blood which mingled with the desert sand , And beaded with its red and ghastly dew The vines and olives of the Holy Land ; The shrieking curses of the hunted Jew ; The white-sown bones of heretics , where'er They sank beneath the Crusade 's holy spear ; Goa 's dark dungeons , Malta 's sea-washed cell , Where with the hymns the ghostly fathers sung Mingled the groans by subtle torture wrung , Heaven 's anthem blending with the shriek of hell ! The midnight of Bartholomew , the stake Of Smithfield , and that thrice-accursed flame Which Calvin kindled by Geneva 's lake ; New England 's scaffold , and the priestly sneer Which mocked its victims in that hour of fear , When guilt itself a human tear might claim ,— Bear witness , O Thou wronged and merciful One ! That Earth 's most hateful crimes have in Thy name been done !</p>
   <p>IV . Thank God ! that I have lived to see the time When the great truth begins at last to find An utterance from the deep heart of mankind , Earnest and clear , that all Revenge is Crime , That man is holier than a creed , that all Restraint upon him must consult his good , Hope 's sunshine linger on his prison wall , And Love look in upon his solitude . The beautiful lesson which our Saviour taught Through long , dark centuries its way hath wrought Into the common mind and popular thought ; And words , to which by Galilee 's lake shore The humble fishers listened with hushed oar , Have found an echo in the general heart , And of the public faith become a living part .</p>
   <p>V. Who shall arrest this tendency ? Bring back The cells of Venice and the bigot 's rack ? Harden the softening human heart again To cold indifference to a brother 's pain ? Ye most unhappy men ! who , turned away From the mild sunshine of the Gospel day , Grope in the shadows of Man 's twilight time , What mean ye , that with ghoul-like zest ye brood , O'er those foul altars streaming with warm blood , Permitted in another age and clime ? Why cite that law with which the bigot Jew Rebuked the Pagan 's mercy , when he knew No evil in the Just One ? Wherefore turn To the dark , cruel past ? Can ye not learn From the pure Teacher 's life how mildly free Is the great Gospel of Humanity ? The Flamen 's knife is bloodless , and no more Mexitli 's altars soak with human gore , No more the ghastly sacrifices smoke Through the green arches of the Druid 's oak ; And ye of milder faith , with your high claim Of prophet-utterance in the Holiest name , Will ye become the Druids of our time Set up your scaffold-altars in our land , And , consecrators of Law 's darkest crime , Urge to its loathsome work the hangman 's hand ? Beware , lest human nature , roused at last , From its peeled shoulder your encumbrance cast , And , sick to loathing of your cry for blood , Rank ye with those who led their victims round The Celt 's red altar and the Indian 's mound , Abhorred of Earth and Heaven , a pagan brotherhood !</p>

   <p>THE HUMAN SACRIFICE .</p>
   <p>Some leading sectarian papers had lately published the letter of a clergyman , giving an account of his attendance upon a criminal ( who had committed murder during a fit of intoxication ) , at the time of his execution , in western New York . The writer describes the agony of the wretched being , his abortive attempts at prayer , his appeal for life , his fear of a violent death ; and , after declaring his belief that the poor victim died without hope of salvation , concludes with a warm eulogy upon the gallows , being more than ever convinced of its utility by the awful dread and horror which it inspired .</p>
   <p>I . FAR from his close and noisome cell , By grassy lane and sunny stream , Blown clover field and strawberry dell , And green and meadow freshness , fell The footsteps of his dream . Again from careless feet the dew Of summer 's misty morn he shook ; Again with merry heart he threw His light line in the rippling brook . Back crowded all his school-day joys ; He urged the ball and quoit again , And heard the shout of laughing boys Come ringing down the walnut glen . Again he felt the western breeze , With scent of flowers and crisping hay ; And down again through wind-stirred trees He saw the quivering sunlight play . An angel in home 's vine-hung door , He saw his sister smile once more ; Once more the truant 's brown-locked head Upon his mother 's knees was laid , And sweetly lulled to slumber there , With evening 's holy hymn and prayer !</p>
   <p>II . He woke . At once on heart and brain The present Terror rushed again ; Clanked on his limbs the felon 's chain He woke , to hear the church-tower tell Time 's footfall on the conscious bell , And , shuddering , feel that clanging din His life 's last hour had ushered in ; To see within his prison-yard , Through the small window , iron barred , The gallows shadow rising dim Between the sunrise heaven and him ; A horror in God 's blessed air ; A blackness in his morning light ; Like some foul devil-altar there Built up by demon hands at night . And , maddened by that evil sight , Dark , horrible , confused , and strange , A chaos of wild , weltering change , All power of check and guidance gone , Dizzy and blind , his mind swept on . In vain he strove to breathe a prayer , In vain he turned the Holy Book , He only heard the gallows-stair Creak as the wind its timbers shook . No dream for him of sin forgiven , While still that baleful spectre stood , With its hoarse murmur , “ Blood for Blood ! ” Between him and the pitying Heaven .</p>
   <p>III . Low on his dungeon floor he knelt , And smote his breast , and on his chain , Whose iron clasp he always felt , His hot tears fell like rain ; And near him , with the cold , calm look And tone of one whose formal part , Unwarmed , unsoftened of the heart , Is measured out by rule and book , With placid lip and tranquil blood , The hangman 's ghostly ally stood , Blessing with solemn text and word The gallows-drop and strangling cord ; Lending the sacred Gospel 's awe And sanction to the crime of Law .</p>
   <p>IV . He saw the victim 's tortured brow , The sweat of anguish starting there , The record of a nameless woe In the dim eye 's imploring stare , Seen hideous through the long , damp hair ,— Fingers of ghastly skin and bone Working and writhing on the stone ! And heard , by mortal terror wrung From heaving breast and stiffened tongue , The choking sob and low hoarse prayer ; As o'er his half-crazed fancy came A vision of the eternal flame , Its smoking cloud of agonies , Its demon-worm that never dies , The everlasting rise and fall Of fire-waves round the infernal wall ; While high above that dark red flood , Black , giant-like , the gallows stood ; Two busy fiends attending there One with cold mocking rite and prayer , The other with impatient grasp , Tightening the death-rope 's strangling clasp .</p>
   <p>V. The unfelt rite at length was done , The prayer unheard at length was said , An hour had passed : the noonday sun Smote on the features of the dead ! And he who stood the doomed beside , Calm gauger of the swelling tide Of mortal agony and fear , Heeding with curious eye and ear Whate'er revealed the keen excess Of man 's extremest wretchedness And who in that dark anguish saw An earnest of the victim 's fate , The vengeful terrors of God 's law , The kindlings of Eternal hate , The first drops of that fiery rain Which beats the dark red realm of pain , Did he uplift his earnest cries Against the crime of Law , which gave His brother to that fearful grave , Whereon Hope 's moonlight never lies , And Faith 's white blossoms never wave To the soft breath of Memory 's sighs ; Which sent a spirit marred and stained , By fiends of sin possessed , profaned , In madness and in blindness stark , Into the silent , unknown dark ? No , from the wild and shrinking dread , With which he saw the victim led Beneath the dark veil which divides Ever the living from the dead , And Nature 's solemn secret hides , The man of prayer can only draw New reasons for his bloody law ; New faith in staying Murder 's hand By murder at that Law 's command ; New reverence for the gallows-rope , As human nature 's latest hope ; Last relic of the good old time , When Power found license for its crime , And held a writhing world in check By that fell cord about its neck ; Stifled Sedition 's rising shout , Choked the young breath of Freedom out , And timely checked the words which sprung From Heresy 's forbidden tongue ; While in its noose of terror bound , The Church its cherished union found , Conforming , on the Moslem plan , The motley-colored mind of man , Not by the Koran and the Sword , But by the Bible and the Cord .</p>
   <p>VI . O Thou at whose rebuke the grave Back to warm life its sleeper gave , Beneath whose sad and tearful glance The cold and changed countenance Broke the still horror of its trance , And , waking , saw with joy above , A brother 's face of tenderest love ; Thou , unto whom the blind and lame , The sorrowing and the sin-sick came , And from Thy very garment 's hem Drew life and healing unto them , The burden of Thy holy faith Was love and life , not hate and death ; Man 's demon ministers of pain , The fiends of his revenge , were sent From thy pure Gospel 's element To their dark home again . Thy name is Love ! What , then , is he , Who in that name the gallows rears , An awful altar built to Thee , With sacrifice of blood and tears ? Oh , once again Thy healing lay On the blind eyes which knew Thee not , And let the light of Thy pure day Melt in upon his darkened thought . Soften his hard , cold heart , and show The power which in forbearance lies , And let him feel that mercy now Is better than old sacrifice .</p>
   <p>VII . As on the White Sea 's charmed shore , The Parsee sees his holy hill ( 10 ) With dunnest smoke-clouds curtained o'er , Yet knows beneath them , evermore , The low , pale fire is quivering still ; So , underneath its clouds of sin , The heart of man retaineth yet Gleams of its holy origin ; And half-quenched stars that never set , Dim colors of its faded bow , And early beauty , linger there , And o'er its wasted desert blow Faint breathings of its morning air . Oh , never yet upon the scroll Of the sin-stained , but priceless soul , Hath Heaven inscribed “ Despair ! ” Cast not the clouded gem away , Quench not the dim but living ray ,— My brother man , Beware ! With that deep voice which from the skies Forbade the Patriarch 's sacrifice , God 's angel cries , Forbear .</p>

    <head>THE PRISONER FOR DEBT .</head>
    <head>Before the law authorizing imprisonment for debt had been abolished in Massachusetts , a revolutionary pensioner was confined in Charlestown jail for a debt of fourteen dollars , and on the fourth of July was seen waving a handkerchief from the bars of his cell in honor of the day .</head>

     <l n="11">No grateful fire before him glows ,</l>

    <head>The writer of these lines is no enemy of Catholics . He has , on more than one occasion , exposed himself to the censures of his Protestant brethren , by his strenuous endeavors to procure indemnification for the owners of the convent destroyed near Boston . He defended the cause of the Irish patriots long before it had become popular in this country ; and he was one of the first to urge the most liberal aid to the suffering and starving population of the Catholic island . The severity of his language finds its ample apology in the reluctant confession of one of the most eminent Romish priests , the eloquent and devoted Father Ventura .</head>

    <head>THE PRISONERS OF NAPLES .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">I HAVE been thinking of the victims bound</l>
     <l n="2">In Naples , dying for the lack of air</l>
     <l n="3">And sunshine , in their close , damp cells of pain ,</l>
     <l n="4">Where hope is not , and innocence in vain</l>
     <l n="5">Appeals against the torture and the chain !</l>
     <l n="6">Unfortunates ! whose crime it was to share</l>
     <l n="7">Our common love of freedom , and to dare ,</l>
     <l n="8">In its behalf , Rome 's harlot triple-crowned ,</l>
     <l n="9">And her base pander , the most hateful thing</l>
     <l n="10">Who upon Christian or on Pagan ground</l>
     <l n="11">Makes vile the old heroic name of king .</l>
     <l n="12">O God most merciful ! Father just and kind</l>
     <l n="13">Whom man hath bound let thy right hand unbind .</l>
     <l n="14">Or , if thy purposes of good behind</l>
     <l n="15">Their ills lie hidden , let the sufferers find</l>
     <l n="16">Strong consolations ; leave them not to doubt</l>
     <l n="17">Thy providential care , nor yet without</l>
     <l n="18">The hope which all thy attributes inspire ,</l>
     <l n="19">That not in vain the martyr 's robe of fire</l>
     <l n="20">Is worn , nor the sad prisoner 's fretting chain ;</l>
     <l n="21">Since all who suffer for thy truth send forth ,</l>
     <l n="22">Electrical , with every throb of pain ,</l>
     <l n="23">Unquenchable sparks , thy own baptismal rain</l>
     <l n="24">Of fire and spirit over all the earth ,</l>
     <l n="25">Making the dead in slavery live again .</l>
     <l n="26">Let this great hope be with them , as they lie</l>
     <l n="27">Shut from the light , the greenness , and the sky ;</l>
     <l n="28">From the cool waters and the pleasant breeze ,</l>
     <l n="29">The smell of flowers , and shade of summer trees ;</l>
     <l n="30">Bound with the felon lepers , whom disease</l>
     <l n="31">And sins abhorred make loathsome ; let them share</l>
     <l n="32">Pellico 's faith , Foresti 's strength to bear</l>
     <l n="33">Years of unutterable torment , stern and still ,</l>
     <l n="34">As the chained Titan victor through his will !</l>
     <l n="35">Comfort them with thy future ; let them see</l>
     <l n="36">The day-dawn of Italian liberty ;</l>
     <l n="37">For that , with all good things , is hid with Thee ,</l>
     <l n="38">And , perfect in thy thought , awaits its time to be .</l>

     <l n="42">Have gained in wider reach of sympathies ,</l>
     <l n="43">And free communion with the good and wise ;</l>

     <l n="45">Such easy self-denial , or repine</l>

     <l n="59">By greenest banks , with asters purple-starred ,</l>
     <l n="60">And gentian bloom and golden-rod made gay ,</l>

     <l n="66">What shall I render , O my God , to thee ?</l>
     <l n="67">Let me not dwell upon my lighter share</l>
     <l n="68">Of pain and ill that human life must bear ;</l>
     <l n="69">Save me from selfish pining ; let my heart ,</l>
     <l n="70">Drawn from itself in sympathy , forget</l>
     <l n="71">The bitter longings of a vain regret ,</l>
     <l n="72">The anguish of its own peculiar smart .</l>
     <l n="73">Remembering others , as I have to-day ,</l>
     <l n="74">In their great sorrows , let me live alway</l>
     <l n="75">Not for myself alone , but have a part ,</l>

    <head>FROM PERUGIA .</head>
    <head>“ The thing which has the most dissevered the people from the Pope ,— the unforgivable thing ,— the breaking point between him and them ,— has been the encouragement and promotion he gave to the officer under whom were executed the slaughters of Perugia . That made the breaking point in many honest hearts that had clung to him before . ” — HARRIET BEECHER STOWE 'S Letters from Italy .</head>

   <p>THE PROBLEM .</p>
   <p>I . NOT without envy Wealth at times must look On their brown strength who wield the reaping-hook And scythe , or at the forge-fire shape the plough Or the steel harness of the steeds of steam ; All who , by skill and patience , anyhow Make service noble , and the earth redeem From savageness . By kingly accolade Than theirs was never worthier knighthood made . Well for them , if , while demagogues their vain And evil counsels proffer , they maintain Their honest manhood unseduced , and wage No war with Labor 's right to Labor 's gain Of sweet home-comfort , rest of hand and brain , And softer pillow for the head of Age .</p>
   <p>II . And well for Gain if it ungrudging yields Labor its just demand ; and well for Ease If in the uses of its own , it sees No wrong to him who tills its pleasant fields And spreads the table of its luxuries . The interests of the rich man and the poor Are one and same , inseparable evermore ; And , when scant wage or labor fail to give Food , shelter , raiment , wherewithal to live , Need has its rights , necessity its claim . Yea , even self-wrought misery and shame Test well the charity suffering long and kind . The home-pressed question of the age can find No answer in the catch-words of the blind Leaders of blind . Solution there is none Save in the Golden Rule of Christ alone .</p>

    <head>ON THE BIG HORN .</head>
    <head>In the disastrous battle on the Big Horn River , in which General Custer and his entire force were slain , the chief Rain-in-the-Face was one of the fiercest leaders of the Indians . In Longfellow 's poem on the massacre , these lines will be remembered :—</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ Revenge ! ” cried Rain-in-the-Face ,</l>
     <l n="2">“ Revenge upon all the race</l>

     <l n="4">And the mountains dark and high</l>

     <l n="7">He is now a man of peace ; and the agent at Standing Rock , Dakota ,</l>

     <l n="9">Hampton . I fear he is too old , but he desires very much to go . ” The</l>
     <l n="10">Southern Workman , the organ of General Armstrong 's Industrial School at</l>
     <l n="11">Hampton , Va ., says in a late number :—</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>“ Rain-in-the-Face has applied before to come to Hampton , but his age would exclude him from the school as an ordinary student . He has shown himself very much in earnest about it , and is anxious , all say , to learn the better ways of life . It is as unusual as it is striking to see a man of his age , and one who has had such an experience , willing to give up the old way , and put himself in the position of a boy and a student . ”</p>

    <head>NOTES</head>
    <p n="1">Note 1 , page 18 . The reader may , perhaps , call to mind the beautiful sonnet of William Wordsworth , addressed to Toussaint L'Ouverture , during his confinement in France .</p>
    <p n="2">“ Toussaint !— thou most unhappy man of men Whether the whistling rustic tends his plough Within thy hearing , or thou liest now Buried in some deep dungeon 's earless den ; O miserable chieftain !— where and when Wilt thou find patience ?— Yet , die not , do thou Wear rather in thy bonds a cheerful brow ; Though fallen thyself , never to rise again , Live and take comfort . Thou hast left behind Powers that will work for thee ; air , earth , and skies ,— There 's not a breathing of the common wind That will forget thee ; thou hast great allies . Thy friends are exultations , agonies , And love , and man 's unconquerable mind . ”</p>
    <p n="3">Note 2 , page 67 . The Northern author of the Congressional rule against receiving petitions of the people on the subject of Slavery .</p>
    <p n="4">Note 3 , page 88 . There was at the time when this poem was written an Association in Liberty County , Georgia , for the religious instruction of negroes . One of their annual reports contains an address by the Rev . Josiah Spry Law , in which the following passage occurs : “ There is a growing interest in this community in the religious instruction of negroes . There is a conviction that religious instruction promotes the quiet and order of the people , and the pecuniary interest of the owners . ”</p>
    <p n="5">Note 4 , page 117 . The book-establishment of the Free-Will Baptists in Dover was refused the act of incorporation by the New Hampshire Legislature , for the reason that the newspaper organ of that sect and its leading preachers favored abolition .</p>
    <p n="6">Note 5 , page 118 . The senatorial editor of the Belknap Gazette all along manifested a peculiar horror of “ niggers ” and “ nigger parties . ”</p>
    <p n="7">Note 6 , page 118 . The justice before whom Elder Storrs was brought for preaching abolition on a writ drawn by Hon . M. N ., Jr ., of Pittsfield . The sheriff served the writ while the elder was praying .</p>
    <p n="8">Note 7 , page 118 . The academy at Canaan , N. H ., received one or two colored scholars , and was in consequence dragged off into a swamp by Democratic teams .</p>
    <p n="9">Note 8 , page 119 . “ Papers and memorials touching the subject of slavery shall be laid on the table without reading , debate , or reference . ” So read the gag-law , as it was called , introduced in the House by Mr. Atherton .</p>
    <p n="10">Note 9 , page 120 . The Female Anti-Slavery Society , at its first meeting in Concord , was assailed with stones and brickbats .</p>
    <p n="11">Note 10 , page 168 . The election of Charles Sumner to the United States Senate “ followed hard upon ” the rendition of the fugitive Sims by the United States officials and the armed police of Boston .</p>
    <p n="12">Note 11 , page 290 . For the idea of this line , I am indebted to Emerson , in his inimitable sonnet to the Rhodora ,—</p>
    <p n="13">“ If eyes were made for seeing , Then Beauty is its own excuse for being . ”</p>
