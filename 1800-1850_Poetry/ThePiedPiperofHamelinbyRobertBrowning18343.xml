     <l n="1">Hamelin Town 's in Brunswick ,</l>
     <l n="2">By famous Hanover city ;</l>
     <l n="3">The river Weser , deep and wide ,</l>
     <l n="4">Washes its wall on the southern side ;</l>
     <l n="5">A pleasanter spot you never spied ;</l>
     <l n="6">But , when begins my ditty ,</l>
     <l n="7">Almost five hundred years ago ,</l>
     <l n="8">To see the townsfolk suffer so</l>
     <l n="9">From vermin , was a pity .</l>

     <head>II .</head>
     <lg type="stanza" n="2">
      <l n="10">Rats !</l>
      <l n="11">They fought the dogs and killed the cats ,</l>
      <l n="12">And bit the babies in the cradles ,</l>
      <l n="13">And ate the cheeses out of the vats .</l>
      <l n="14">And licked the soup from the cook 's own ladles ,</l>
      <l n="15">Split open the kegs of salted sprats ,</l>
      <l n="16">Made nests inside men 's Sunday hats ,</l>
      <l n="17">And even spoiled the women 's chats ,</l>
      <l n="18">By drowning their speaking</l>
      <l n="19">With shrieking and squeaking</l>
      <l n="20">In fifty different sharps and flats .</l>

     <lg type="stanza" n="3">
      <l n="21">At last the people in a body</l>
      <l n="22">To the Town Hall came flocking :</l>
      <l n="23">“ Tis clear , ” cried they , “ our Mayor 's a noddy ;</l>
      <l n="24">And as for our Corporation — shocking</l>
      <l n="25">To think we buy gowns lined with ermine</l>
      <l n="26">For dolts that can n't or wo n't determine</l>
      <l n="27">What 's best to rid us of our vermin !</l>
      <l n="28">You hope , because you 're old and obese ,</l>
      <l n="29">To find in the furry civic robe ease ?</l>
      <l n="30">Rouse up , sirs ! Give your brains a racking</l>
      <l n="31">To find the remedy we 're lacking ,</l>
      <l n="32">Or , sure as fate , we 'll send you packing ! ”</l>
      <l n="33">At this the Mayor and Corporation</l>
      <l n="34">Quaked with a mighty consternation .</l>
     </lg>
    </lg>
    <lg type="part" n="3">
     <head>IV .</head>
     <lg type="stanza" n="4">
      <l n="35">An hour they sate in council ,</l>
      <l n="36">At length the Mayor broke silence :</l>
      <l n="37">“ For a guilder I 'd my ermine gown sell ;</l>
      <l n="38">I wish I were a mile hence !</l>
      <l n="39">It 's easy to bid one rack one 's brain —</l>
      <l n="40">I 'm sure my poor head aches again ,</l>
      <l n="41">I 've scratched it so , and all in vain</l>
      <l n="42">Oh for a trap , a trap , a trap ! ”</l>
      <l n="43">Just as he said this , what should hap</l>
      <l n="44">At the chamber door but a gentle tap ?</l>
      <l n="45">“ Bless us , ” cried the Mayor , “ what 's that ? ”</l>
      <l n="46">( With the Corporation as he sat ,</l>
      <l n="47">Looking little though wondrous fat ;</l>
      <l n="48">Nor brighter was his eye , nor moister</l>
      <l n="49">Than a too-long-opened oyster ,</l>
      <l n="50">Save when at noon his paunch grew mutinous</l>
      <l n="51">For a plate of turtle green and glutinous )</l>
      <l n="52">“ Only a scraping of shoes on the mat ?</l>
      <l n="53">Anything like the sound of a rat</l>
      <l n="54">Makes my heart go pit-a-pat ! ”</l>

     <lg type="stanza" n="5">
      <l n="55">“ Come in ! ” — the Mayor cried , looking bigger :</l>
      <l n="56">And in did come the strangest figure !</l>
      <l n="57">His queer long coat from heel to head</l>
      <l n="58">Was half of yellow and half of red ,</l>
      <l n="59">And he himself was tall and thin ,</l>
      <l n="60">With sharp blue eyes , each like a pin ,</l>
      <l n="61">And light loose hair , yet swarthy skin</l>
      <l n="62">No tuft on cheek nor beard on chin ,</l>
      <l n="63">But lips where smile went out and in ;</l>
      <l n="64">There was no guessing his kith and kin :</l>
      <l n="65">And nobody could enough admire</l>
      <l n="66">The tall man and his quaint attire .</l>
      <l n="67">Quoth one : “ It 's as my great-grandsire ,</l>
      <l n="68">Starting up at the Trump of Doom 's tone ,</l>
      <l n="69">Had walked this way from his painted tombstone ! ”</l>

     <head>VI .</head>
     <lg type="stanza" n="6">
      <l n="70">He advanced to the council-table :</l>
      <l n="71">And , “ Please your honours , ” said he , “ I 'm able ,</l>
      <l n="72">By means of a secret charm , to draw</l>
      <l n="73">All creatures living beneath the sun ,</l>
      <l n="74">That creep or swim or fly or run ,</l>
      <l n="75">After me so as you never saw !</l>
      <l n="76">And I chiefly use my charm</l>
      <l n="77">On creatures that do people harm ,</l>
      <l n="78">The mole and toad and newt and viper ;</l>
      <l n="79">And people call me the Pied Piper . ”</l>
      <l n="80">( And here they noticed round his neck</l>
      <l n="81">A scarf of red and yellow stripe ,</l>
      <l n="82">To match with his coat of the self-same cheque ;</l>
      <l n="83">And at the scarf 's end hung a pipe ;</l>
      <l n="84">And his fingers they noticed were ever straying</l>
      <l n="85">As if impatient to be playing</l>
      <l n="86">Upon his pipe , as low it dangled</l>
      <l n="87">Over his vesture so old-fangled . )</l>
      <l n="88">“ Yet , ” said he , “ poor Piper as I am ,</l>
      <l n="89">In Tartary I freed the Cham ,</l>
      <l n="90">Last June , from his huge swarms of gnats ,</l>
      <l n="91">I eased in Asia the Nizam</l>
      <l n="92">Of a monstrous brood of vampyre-bats :</l>
      <l n="93">And as for what your brain bewilders ,</l>
      <l n="94">If I can rid your town of rats</l>
      <l n="95">Will you give me a thousand guilders ? ”</l>
      <l n="96">“ One ? fifty thousand ! ” — was the exclamation</l>
      <l n="97">Of the astonished Mayor and Corporation .</l>

     <head>VII .</head>
     <lg type="stanza" n="7">
      <l n="98">Into the street the Piper stept ,</l>
      <l n="99">Smiling first a little smile ,</l>
      <l n="100">As if he knew what magic slept</l>
      <l n="101">In his quiet pipe the while ;</l>
      <l n="102">Then , like a musical adept ,</l>
      <l n="103">To blow the pipe his lips he wrinkled ,</l>
      <l n="104">And green and blue his sharp eyes twinkled ,</l>
      <l n="105">Like a candle-flame where salt is sprinkled ;</l>
      <l n="106">And ere three shrill notes the pipe uttered ,</l>
      <l n="107">You heard as if an army muttered ;</l>
      <l n="108">And the muttering grew to a grumbling ;</l>
      <l n="109">And the grumbling grew to a mighty rumbling ;</l>
      <l n="110">And out of the houses the rats came tumbling .</l>
      <l n="111">Great rats , small rats , lean rats , brawny rats ,</l>
      <l n="112">Brown rats , black rats , grey rats , tawny rats ,</l>
      <l n="113">Grave old plodders , gay young friskers ,</l>
      <l n="114">Fathers , mothers , uncles , cousins ,</l>
      <l n="115">Cocking tails and pricking whiskers ,</l>
      <l n="116">Families by tens and dozens ,</l>
      <l n="117">Brothers , sisters , husbands , wives —</l>
      <l n="118">Followed the Piper for their lives .</l>
      <l n="119">From street to street he piped advancing ,</l>
      <l n="120">And step for step they followed dancing ,</l>
      <l n="121">Until they came to the river Weser</l>
      <l n="122">Wherein all plunged and perished !</l>
      <l n="123">— Save one who , stout as Julius Cæsar ,</l>
      <l n="124">Swam across and lived to carry</l>
      <l n="125">( As he , the manuscript he cherished )</l>
      <l n="126">To Rat-land home his commentary :</l>
      <l n="127">Which was , “ At the first shrill notes of the pipe ,</l>
      <l n="128">I heard a sound as of scraping tripe ,</l>
      <l n="129">And putting apples , wondrous ripe ,</l>
      <l n="130">Into a cider-press 's gripe :</l>
      <l n="131">And a moving away of pickle-tub-boards ,</l>
      <l n="132">And a leaving ajar of conserve-cupboards ,</l>
      <l n="133">And a drawing the corks of train-oil-flasks ,</l>
      <l n="134">And a breaking the hoops of butter-casks :</l>
      <l n="135">And it seemed as if a voice</l>
      <l n="136">( Sweeter far than by harp or by psaltery</l>
      <l n="137">Is breathed ) called out , ‘ Oh rats , rejoice !</l>
      <l n="138">The world is grown to one vast drysaltery !</l>
      <l n="139">So munch on , crunch on , take your nuncheon ,</l>
      <l n="140">Breakfast , supper , dinner , luncheon ! ’</l>
      <l n="141">And just as a bulky sugar-puncheon ,</l>
      <l n="142">All ready staved , like a great sun shone</l>
      <l n="143">Glorious scarce an inch before me ,</l>
      <l n="144">Just as methought it said , ‘ Come , bore me ! ’</l>

      <l n="158">With Claret , Moselle , Vin-de-Grave , Hock ;</l>

      <l n="160">Their cellar 's biggest butt with Rhenish .</l>

      <l n="162">With a gipsy coat of red and yellow !</l>

      <l n="236">Did I say , all ? No ; One was lame ,</l>
      <l n="237">And could not dance the whole of the way ;</l>
      <l n="238">And in after years , if you would blame</l>
      <l n="239">His sadness , he was used to say ,—</l>
      <l n="240">“ It 's dull in our town since my playmates left !</l>
      <l n="241">I can n't forget that I 'm bereft</l>
      <l n="242">Of all the pleasant sights they see ,</l>
      <l n="243">Which the Piper also promised me .</l>
      <l n="244">For he led us , he said , to a joyous land ,</l>
      <l n="245">Joining the town and just at hand ,</l>
      <l n="246">Where waters gushed and fruit-trees grew ,</l>
      <l n="247">And flowers put forth a fairer hue ,</l>
      <l n="248">And everything was strange and new ;</l>
      <l n="249">The sparrows were brighter than peacocks here ,</l>
      <l n="250">And their dogs outran our fallow deer ,</l>
      <l n="251">And honey-bees had lost their stings ,</l>
      <l n="252">And horses were born with eagles ’ wings ;</l>
      <l n="253">And just as I became assured</l>
      <l n="254">My lame foot would be speedily cured ,</l>
      <l n="255">The music stopped and I stood still ,</l>
      <l n="256">And found myself outside the hill ,</l>
      <l n="257">Left alone against my will ,</l>
      <l n="258">To go now limping as before ,</l>
      <l n="259">And never hear of that country more ! ”</l>

      <l n="260">Alas , alas for Hamelin !</l>
      <l n="261">There came into many a burgher 's pate</l>
      <l n="262">A text which says that Heaven 's gate</l>
      <l n="263">Opes to the rich at as easy rate</l>
      <l n="264">As the needle 's eye takes a camel in !</l>
      <l n="265">The Mayor sent East , West , North , and South ,</l>
      <l n="266">To offer the Piper , by word of mouth ,</l>
      <l n="267">Wherever it was men 's lot to find him ,</l>
      <l n="268">Silver and gold to his heart 's content ,</l>
      <l n="269">If he 'd only return the way he went ,</l>
      <l n="270">And bring the children behind him .</l>
      <l n="271">But when they saw ‘ twas a lost endeavour ,</l>
      <l n="272">And Piper and dancers were gone for ever ,</l>
      <l n="273">They made a decree that lawyers never</l>
      <l n="274">Should think their records dated duly</l>
      <l n="275">If , after the day of the month and year ,</l>
      <l n="276">These words did not as well appear ,</l>
      <l n="277">“ And so long after what happened here</l>
      <l n="278">On the Twenty-second of July ,</l>
      <l n="279">Thirteen hundred and seventy-six : ”</l>
      <l n="280">And the better in memory to fix</l>
      <l n="281">The place of the children 's last retreat ,</l>
      <l n="282">They called it , the Pied Piper 's Street —</l>
      <l n="283">Where any one playing on pipe or tabor ,</l>
      <l n="284">Was sure for the future to lose his labour .</l>
      <l n="285">Nor suffered they hostelry or tavern</l>
      <l n="286">To shock with mirth a street so solemn ;</l>
      <l n="287">But opposite the place of the cavern</l>
      <l n="288">They wrote the story on a column ,</l>
      <l n="289">And on the great church-window painted</l>
      <l n="290">The same , to make the world acquainted</l>
      <l n="291">How their children were stolen away ,</l>
      <l n="292">And there it stands to this very day .</l>
      <l n="293">And I must not omit to say</l>
      <l n="294">That in Transylvania there 's a tribe</l>
      <l n="295">Of alien people that ascribe</l>
      <l n="296">The outlandish ways and dress</l>
      <l n="297">On which their neighbours lay such stress ,</l>
      <l n="298">To their fathers and mothers having risen</l>
      <l n="299">Out of some subterraneous prison</l>
      <l n="300">Into which they were trepanned</l>
      <l n="301">Long time ago in a mighty band</l>
      <l n="302">Out of Hamelin town in Brunswick land ,</l>
      <l n="303">But how or why , they do n't understand .</l>
