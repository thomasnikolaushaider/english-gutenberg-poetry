   <p>TENNYSON .</p>
   <p>MEMOIR OF</p>
   <p>VICTOR MARIE HUGO .</p>
   <p>Towards the close of the First French Revolution , Joseph Leopold Sigisbert Hugo , son of a joiner at Nancy , and an officer risen from the ranks in the Republican army , married Sophie Trébuchet , daughter of a Nantes fitter-out of privateers , a Vendean royalist and devotee .</p>
   <p>Victor Marie Hugo , their second son , was born on the 26th of February , 1802 , at Besançon , France . Though a weakling , he was carried , with his boy-brothers , in the train of their father through the south of France , in pursuit of Fra Diavolo , the Italian brigand , and finally into Spain .</p>
   <p>Colonel Hugo had become General , and there , besides being governor over three provinces , was Lord High Steward at King Joseph 's court , where his eldest son Abel was installed as page . The other two were educated for similar posts among hostile young Spaniards under stern priestly tutors in the Nobles ’ College at Madrid , a palace become a monastery . Upon the English advance to free Spain of the invaders , the general and Abel remained at bay , whilst the mother and children hastened to Paris .</p>
   <p>Again , in a house once a convent , Victor and his brother Eugène were taught by priests until , by the accident of their roof sheltering a comrade of their father 's , a change of tutor was afforded them . This was General Lahorie , a man of superior education , main supporter of Malet in his daring plot to take the government into the Republicans ’ hands during the absence of Napoleon I. in Russia . Lahorie read old French and Latin with Victor till the police scented him out and led him to execution , October , 1812 .</p>
   <p>School claimed the young Hugos after this tragical episode , where they were oddities among the humdrum tradesmen 's sons . Victor , thoughtful and taciturn , rhymed profusely in tragedies , “ printing ” in his books , “ Châteaubriand or nothing ! ” and engaging his more animated brother to flourish the Cid 's sword and roar the tyrant 's speeches .</p>
   <p>In 1814 , both suffered a sympathetic anxiety as their father held out at Thionville against the Allies , finally repulsing them by a sortie . This was pure loyalty to the fallen Bonaparte , for Hugo had lost his all in Spain , his very savings having been sunk in real estate , through King Joseph 's insistence on his adherents investing to prove they had “ come to stay . ”</p>
   <p>The Bourbons enthroned anew , General Hugo received , less for his neutrality than thanks to his wife 's piety and loyalty , confirmation of his title and rank , and , moreover , a fieldmarshalship . Abel was accepted as a page , too , but there was no money awarded the ex-Bonapartist — money being what the Eaglet at Reichstadt most required for an attempt at his father 's throne — and the poor officer was left in seclusion to write consolingly about his campaigns and “ Defences of Fortified Towns . ”</p>
   <p>Decidedly the pen had superseded the sword , for Victor and Eugène were scribbling away in ephemeral political sheets as apprenticeship to founding a periodical of their own .</p>
   <p>Victor 's poetry became remarkable in La Muse Française and Le Conservateur Littéraire , the odes being permeated with Legitimist and anti-revolutionary sentiments delightful to the taste of Madam Hugo , member as she was of the courtly Order of the Royal Lily .</p>
   <p>In 1817 , the French Academy honorably mentioned Victor 's “ Odes on the Advantages of Study , ” with a misgiving that some elder hand was masked under the line ascribing “ scant fifteen years ” to the author . At the Toulouse Floral Games he won prizes two years successively . His critical judgment was sound as well , for he had divined the powers of Lamartine .</p>
   <p>His “ Odes , ” collected in a volume , gave his ever-active mother her opportunity at Court . Louis XVIII . granted the boy-poet a pension of 1 , 500 francs .</p>
   <p>It was the windfall for which the youth had been waiting to enable him to gratify his first love . In his childhood , his father and one M. Foucher , head of a War Office Department , had jokingly betrothed a son of the one to a daughter of the other . Abel had loftier views than alliance with a civil servant 's child ; Eugène was in love elsewhere ; but Victor had fallen enamored with Adèle Foucher . It is true , when poverty beclouded the Hugos , the Fouchers had shrunk into their mantle of dignity , and the girl had been strictly forbidden to correspond with her child-sweetheart .</p>
   <p>He , finding letters barred out , wrote a love story ( “ Hans of Iceland ” ) in two weeks , where were recited his hopes , fears , and constancy , and this book she could read .</p>
   <p>It pleased the public no less , and its sale , together with that of the “ Odes ” and a West Indian romance , “ Buck Jargal , ” together with a royal pension , emboldened the poet to renew his love-suit . To refuse the recipient of court funds was not possible to a public functionary . M. Foucher consented to the betrothal in the summer of 1821 .</p>
   <p>So encloistered had Mdlle . Adèle been , her reading “ Hans ” the exceptional intrusion , that she only learnt on meeting her affianced that he was mourning his mother . In October , 1822 , they were wed , the bride nineteen , the bridegroom but one year the elder . The dinner was marred by the sinister disaster of Eugène Hugo going mad . ( He died in an asylum five years later . ) The author terminated his wedding year with the “ Ode to Louis XVIII ., ” read to a society after the President of the Academy had introduced him as “ the most promising of our young lyrists . ”</p>
   <p>In spite of new poems revealing a Napoleonic bias , Victor was invited to see Charles X. consecrated at Rheims , 29th of May , 1825 , and was entered on the roll of the Legion of Honor repaying the favors with the verses expected . But though a son was born to him he was not restored to Conservatism ; with his mother 's death all that had vanished . His tragedy of “ Cromwell ” broke lances upon Royalists and upholders of the still reigning style of tragedy . The second collection of “ Odes ” preluding it , showed the spirit of the son of Napoleon 's general , rather than of the Bourbonist field-marshal . On the occasion , too , of the Duke of Tarento being announced at the Austrian Ambassador 's ball , February , 1827 , as plain “ Marshal Macdonald , ” Victor became the mouthpiece of indignant Bonapartists in his “ Ode to the Napoleon Column ” in the Place Vendôme .</p>
   <p>His “ Orientales , ” though written in a Parisian suburb by one who had not travelled , appealed for Grecian liberty , and depicted sultans and pashas as tyrants , many a line being deemed applicable to personages nearer the Seine than Stamboul .</p>
   <p>“ Cromwell ” was not actable , and “ Amy Robsart , ” in collaboration with his brother-in-law , Foucher , miserably failed , notwithstanding a finale “ superior to Scott 's ‘ Kenilworth . ’ ” In one twelvemonth , there was this failure to record , the death of his father from apoplexy at his eldest son 's marriage , and the birth of a second son to Victor towards the close .</p>
   <p>Still imprudent , the young father again irritated the court with satire in “ Marion Delorme ” and “ Hernani , ” two plays immediately suppressed by the Censure , all the more active as the Revolution of July , 1830 , was surely seething up to the edge of the crater .</p>
   <p>( At this juncture , the poet Châteaubriand , fading star to our rising sun , yielded up to him formally “ his place at the poets ’ table . ” )</p>
   <p>In the summer of 1831 , a civil ceremony was performed over the insurgents killed in the previous year , and Hugo was constituted poet-laureate of the Revolution by having his hymn sung in the Pantheon over the biers .</p>
   <p>Under Louis Philippe , “ Marion Delorme ” could be played , but livelier attention was turned to “ Nôtre Dame de Paris , ” the historical romance in which Hugo vied with Sir Walter . It was to have been followed by others , but the publisher unfortunately secured a contract to monopolize all the new novelist 's prose fictions for a term of years , and the author revenged himself by publishing poems and plays alone . Hence “ Nôtre Dame ” long stood unique : it was translated in all languages , and plays and operas were founded on it . Heine professed to see in the prominence of the hunchback a personal appeal of the author , who was slightly deformed by one shoulder being a trifle higher than the other ; this malicious suggestion reposed also on the fact that the quasi-hero of “ Le Roi s'Amuse ” ( 1832 , a tragedy suppressed after one representation , for its reflections on royalty ) , was also a contorted piece of humanity . This play was followed by “ Lucrezia Borgia , ” “ Marie Tudor , ” and “ Angelo , ” written in a singular poetic prose . Spite of bald translations , their action was sufficiently dramatic to make them successes , and even still enduring on our stage . They have all been arranged as operas , whilst Hugo himself , to oblige the father of Louise Bertin , a magazine publisher of note , wrote “ Esmeralda ” for her music in 1835 .</p>
   <p>Thus , at 1837 , when he was promoted to an officership in the Legion of Honor , it was acknowledged his due as a laborious worker in all fields of literature , however contestable the merits and tendencies of his essays .</p>
   <p>In 1839 , the Academy , having rejected him several times , elected him among the Forty Immortals . In the previous year had been successfully acted “ Ruy Blas , ” for which play he had gone to Spanish sources ; with and after the then imperative Rhine tour , came an unendurable “ trilogy , ” the “ Burgraves , ” played one long , long night in 1843 . A real tragedy was to mark that year : his daughter Léopoldine being drowned in the Seine with her husband , who would not save himself when he found that her death-grasp on the sinking boat was not to be loosed .</p>
   <p>For distraction , Hugo plunged into politics . A peer in 1845 , he sat between Marshal Soult and Pontécoulant , the regicide-judge of Louis XVI . His maiden speech bore upon artistic copyright ; but he rapidly became a power in much graver matters .</p>
   <p>As fate would have it , his speech on the Bonapartes induced King Louis Philippe to allow Prince Louis Napoleon Bonaparte to return , and , there being no gratitude in politics , the emancipated outlaw rose as a rival candidate for the Presidency , for which Hugo had nominated himself in his newspaper the Evènement . The story of the Coup d'État is well known ; for the Republican 's side , read Hugo 's own “ History of a Crime . ” Hugo , proscribed , betook himself to Brussels , London , and the Channel Islands , waiting to “ return with right when the usurper should be expelled . ”</p>
   <p>Meanwhile , he satirized the Third Napoleon and his congeners with ceaseless shafts , the principal being the famous “ Napoleon the Little , ” based on the analogical reasoning that as the earth has moons , the lion the jackal , man himself his simian double , a minor Napoleon was inevitable as a standard of estimation , the grain by which a pyramid is measured . These flings were collected in “ Les Châtiments , ” a volume preceded by “ Les Contemplations ” ( mostly written in the ‘ 40 's ) , and followed by “ Les Chansons des Rues et des Bois . ”</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">The baffled publisher 's close-time having expired , or , at least , his heirs</l>
     <l n="2">being satisfied , three novels appeared , long heralded : in 1862 , “ Les</l>
     <l n="3">Misérables ” ( Ye Wretched ) , wherein the author figures as Marius and his</l>
     <l n="4">father as the Bonapartist officer : in 1866 , “ Les Travailleurs de la Mer ”</l>
     <l n="5">( Toilers of the Sea ) , its scene among the Channel Islands ; and , in 1868 ,</l>
     <l n="6">“ L'Homme Qui Rit ” ( The Man who Grins ) , unfortunately laid in a fanciful</l>
     <l n="7">England evolved from recondite reading through foreign spectacles . Whilst</l>
     <l n="8">writing the final chapters , Hugo 's wife died ; and , as he had refused the</l>
     <l n="9">Amnesty , he could only escort her remains to the Belgian frontier , August ,</l>
     <l n="10">1868 . All this while , in his Paris daily newspaper , Le Rappei</l>
     <l n="11">( adorned with cuts of a Revolutionary drummer beating “ to arms ! ” ) , he and</l>
     <l n="12">his sons and son-in-law 's family were reiterating blows at the throne .</l>
     <l n="13">When it came down in 1870 , and the Republic was proclaimed , Hugo hastened</l>
     <l n="14">to Paris .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>His poems , written during the War and Siege , collected under the title of “ L'Année Terrible ” ( The Terrible Year , 1870-71 ) , betray the long-tried exile , “ almost alone in his gloom , ” after the death of his son Charles and his child . Fleeing to Brussels after the Commune , he nevertheless was so aggressive in sheltering and aiding its fugitives , that he was banished the kingdom , lest there should be a renewal of an assault on his house by the mob , supposed by his adherents to be , not “ the honest Belgians , ” but the refugee Bonapartists and Royalists , who had not cared to fight for France in France endangered . Resting in Luxemburg , he prepared “ L'Année Terrible ” for the press , and thence returned to Paris , vainly to plead with President Thiers for the captured Communists ’ lives , and vainly , too , proposing himself for election to the new House .</p>
   <p>In 1872 , his novel of “ ‘ 93 ” pleased the general public here , mainly by the adventures of three charming little children during the prevalence of an internecine war . These phases of a bounteously paternal mood reappeared in “ L'Art d'être Grandpère , ” published in 1877 , when he had become a life-senator .</p>
   <p>“ Hernani ” was in the regular “ stock ” of the Théâtre Français , “ Rigoletto ” ( Le Roi s'Amuse ) always at the Italian opera-house , while the same subject , under the title of “ The Fool 's Revenge , ” held , as it still holds , a high position on the Anglo-American stage . Finally , the poetic romance of “ Torquemada , ” for over thirty years promised , came forth in 1882 , to prove that the wizard-wand had not lost its cunning .</p>
   <p>After dolor , fêtes were come : on one birthday they crown his bust in the chief theatre ; on another , all notable Paris parades under his window , where he sits with his grandchildren at his knee , in the shadow of the Triumphal Arch of Napoleon 's Star . It is given to few men thus to see their own apotheosis .</p>
   <p>Whilst he was dying , in May , 1885 , Paris was but the first mourner for all France ; and the magnificent funeral pageant which conducted the pauper 's coffin , antithetically enshrining the remains considered worthy of the highest possible reverence and honors , from the Champs Elysées to the Pantheon , was the more memorable from all that was foremost in French art and letters having marched in the train , and laid a leaf or flower in the tomb of the protégé of Châteaubriand , the brother-in-arms of Dumas , the inspirer of Mars , Dorval , Le-maître , Rachel , and Bernhardt , and , above all , the Nemesis of the Third Empire .</p>

     <l n="23">A hundred rough and crooked elbows made ;</l>
     <l n="24">And in this sombre group the wind had swayed ,</l>
     <l n="25">Nor life — nor death — but life in death seemed found .</l>
     <l n="26">The cresses drink — the water flows — and round</l>
     <l n="27">Upon the slopes the mountain rowans meet ,</l>
     <l n="28">And ‘ neath the brushwood plant their gnarled feet ,</l>
     <l n="29">Intwining slowly where the creepers twine .</l>
     <l n="30">There , too , the lakes as mirrors brightly shine ,</l>
     <l n="31">And show the swan-necked flowers , each line by line .</l>
     <l n="32">Chimeras roused take stranger shapes for thee ,</l>
     <l n="33">The glittering scales of mailèd throat we see ,</l>
     <l n="34">And claws tight pressed on huge old knotted tree ;</l>
     <l n="35">While from a cavern dim the bright eyes glare .</l>
     <l n="36">Oh , vegetation ! Spirit ! Do we dare</l>
     <l n="37">Question of matter , and of forces found</l>
     <l n="38">‘ Neath a rude skin-in living verdure bound .</l>
     <l n="39">Oh , Master — I , like thee , have wandered oft</l>
     <l n="40">Where mighty trees made arches high aloft ,</l>
     <l n="41">But ever with a consciousness of strife ,</l>
     <l n="42">A surging struggle of the inner life .</l>
     <l n="43">Ever the trembling of the grass I say ,</l>
     <l n="44">And the boughs rocking as the breezes play ,</l>
     <l n="45">Have stirred deep thoughts in a bewild'ring way .</l>
     <l n="46">Oh , God ! alone Great Witness of all deeds ,</l>
     <l n="47">Of thoughts and acts , and all our human needs ,</l>
     <l n="48">God only knows how often in such scenes</l>
     <l n="49">Of savage beauty under leafy screens ,</l>
     <l n="50">I 've felt the mighty oaks had spirit dower —</l>
     <l n="51">Like me knew mirth and sorrow — sentient power ,</l>
     <l n="52">And whisp'ring each to each in twilight dim ,</l>
     <l n="53">Had hearts that beat — and owned a soul from Him !</l>

     <l n="29">The limpid ocean mirrors all the stars ,</l>
     <l n="30">And while the pilot , from the infinite main ,</l>
     <l n="31">Looks with calm eye into the infinite heaven ,</l>
     <l n="32">I dreaming of you only , seek to scan</l>

     <l n="19">Till tramps a butcher by — he risks his head —</l>
     <l n="20">In darts the hand and crushes out the yell ,</l>
     <l n="21">And plucks the hide — as from a nut the shell —</l>
     <l n="22">He holds him nude , and sneers : “ An ape you dread ! ”</l>

     <l n="6">The dark man reached a mount in a great plain ,</l>

     <l n="17">Pale , silent , watchful , shaking at each sound ;</l>
     <l n="18">No rest , no sleep , till he attained the strand</l>
     <l n="19">Where the sea washes that which since was Asshur .</l>
     <l n="20">“ Here pause , ” he said , “ for this place is secure ;</l>
     <l n="21">Here may we rest , for this is the world 's end . ”</l>

     <l n="28">In tents ): “ Spread here the curtain of thy tent , ”</l>
     <l n="29">And they spread wide the floating canvas roof ,</l>

     <l n="35">That handle harp and organ ): “ I will build</l>
     <l n="36">A sanctuary ; ” and he made a wall of bronze ,</l>
     <l n="37">And set his sire behind it . But Cain moaned ,</l>
     <l n="38">“ That Eye is glaring at me ever . ” Henoch cried :</l>
     <l n="39">“ Then must we make a circle vast of towers ,</l>
     <l n="40">So terrible that nothing dare draw near ;</l>
     <l n="41">Build we a city with a citadel ;</l>

     <l n="43">Then Tubal Cain ( instructor of all them</l>

     <l n="45">Enormous , superhuman . While he wrought ,</l>
     <l n="46">His fiery brothers from the plain around</l>
     <l n="47">Hunted the sons of Enoch and of Seth ;</l>
     <l n="48">They plucked the eyes out of whoever passed ,</l>
     <l n="49">And hurled at even arrows to the stars .</l>
     <l n="50">They set strong granite for the canvas wall ,</l>
     <l n="51">And every block was clamped with iron chains .</l>
     <l n="52">It seemed a city made for hell . Its towers ,</l>
     <l n="53">With their huge masses made night in the land .</l>
     <l n="54">The walls were thick as mountains . On the door</l>
     <l n="55">They graved : “ Let not God enter here . ” This done ,</l>
     <l n="56">And having finished to cement and build</l>
     <l n="57">In a stone tower , they set him in the midst .</l>
     <l n="58">To him , still dark and haggard , “ Oh , my sire ,</l>
     <l n="59">Is the Eye gone ? ” quoth Zillah tremblingly .</l>
     <l n="60">But Cain replied : “ Nay , it is even there . ”</l>
     <l n="61">Then added : “ I will live beneath the earth ,</l>
     <l n="62">As a lone man within his sepulchre .</l>
     <l n="63">I will see nothing ; will be seen of none . ”</l>
     <l n="64">They digged a trench , and Cain said : “ ‘ Tis enow , ”</l>
     <l n="65">As he went down alone into the vault ;</l>
     <l n="66">But when he sat , so ghost-like , in his chair ,</l>
     <l n="67">And they had closed the dungeon o'er his head ,</l>

      <l n="32">Answered that hoar associate of the clouds :</l>
      <l n="33">“ Spectre , I know not , I am always here . ”</l>
      <l n="34">Canute departed , and with head erect ,</l>
      <l n="35">All white and ghastly in his robe of snow ,</l>
      <l n="36">Went forth into great silence and great night</l>
      <l n="37">By Iceland and Norway . After him</l>
      <l n="38">Gloom swallowed up the universe . He stood</l>
      <l n="39">A sovran kingdomless , a lonely ghost</l>
      <l n="40">Confronted with Immensity . He saw</l>
      <l n="41">The awful Infinite , at whose portal pale</l>
      <l n="42">Lightning sinks dying ; Darkness , skeleton</l>
      <l n="43">Whose joints are nights , and utter Formlessness</l>
      <l n="44">Moving confusedly in the horrible dark</l>
      <l n="45">Inscrutable and blind . No star was there ,</l>
      <l n="46">Yet something like a haggard gleam ; no sound</l>
      <l n="47">But the dull tide of Darkness , and her dumb</l>
      <l n="48">And fearful shudder . “ ‘ Tis the tomb , ” he said ,</l>
      <l n="49">“ God is beyond ! ” Three steps he took , then cried :</l>
      <l n="50">‘ Twas deathly as the grave , and not a voice</l>
      <l n="51">Responded , nor came any breath to sway</l>
      <l n="52">The snowy mantle , with unsullied white</l>
      <l n="53">Emboldening the spectral wanderer .</l>
      <l n="54">Sudden he marked how , like a gloomy star ,</l>
      <l n="55">A spot grew broad upon his livid robe ;</l>
      <l n="56">Slowly it widened , raying darkness forth ;</l>
      <l n="57">And Canute proved it with his spectral hands</l>
      <l n="58">It was a drop of blood .</l>

      <l n="1">But he saw nothing ; space was black — no sound .</l>
      <l n="2">“ Forward , ” said Canute , raising his proud head .</l>
      <l n="3">There fell a second stain beside the first ,</l>
      <l n="4">Then it grew larger , and the Cimbrian chief</l>
      <l n="5">Stared at the thick vague darkness , and saw naught .</l>
      <l n="6">Still as a bloodhound follows on his track ,</l>
      <l n="7">Sad he went on . ‘ There fell a third red stain</l>
      <l n="8">On the white winding-sheet . He had never fled ;</l>
      <l n="9">Howbeit Canute forward went no more ,</l>
      <l n="10">But turned on that side where the sword arm hangs .</l>
      <l n="11">A drop of blood , as if athwart a dream ,</l>
      <l n="12">Fell on the shroud , and reddened his right hand .</l>
      <l n="13">Then , as in reading one turns back a page ,</l>
      <l n="14">A second time he changed his course , and turned</l>
      <l n="15">To the dim left . There fell a drop of blood .</l>
      <l n="16">Canute drew back , trembling to be alone ,</l>
      <l n="17">And wished he had not left his burial couch .</l>
      <l n="18">But , when a blood-drop fell again , he stopped ,</l>
      <l n="19">Stooped his pale head , and tried to make a prayer .</l>
      <l n="20">Then fell a drop , and the prayer died away</l>
      <l n="21">In savage terror . Darkly he moved on ,</l>
      <l n="22">A hideous spectre hesitating , white ,</l>
      <l n="23">And ever as he went , a drop of blood</l>
      <l n="24">Implacably from the darkness broke away</l>
      <l n="25">And stained that awful whiteness . He beheld</l>
      <l n="26">Shaking , as doth a poplar in the wind ,</l>
      <l n="27">Those stains grow darker and more numerous :</l>
      <l n="28">Another , and another , and another .</l>
      <l n="29">They seem to light up that funereal gloom ,</l>
      <l n="30">And mingling in the folds of that white sheet ,</l>
      <l n="31">Made it a cloud of blood . He went , and went ,</l>
      <l n="32">And still from that unfathomable vault</l>
      <l n="33">The red blood dropped upon him drop by drop ,</l>
      <l n="34">Always , for ever — without noise , as though</l>
      <l n="35">From the black feet of some night-gibbeted corpse .</l>
      <l n="36">Alas ! Who wept those formidable tears ?</l>
      <l n="37">The Infinite !— Toward Heaven , of the good</l>
      <l n="38">Attainable , through the wild sea of night ,</l>
      <l n="39">That hath not ebb nor flow , Canute went on ,</l>
      <l n="40">And ever walking , came to a closed door ,</l>
      <l n="41">That from beneath showed a mysterious light .</l>
      <l n="42">Then he looked down upon his winding-sheet ,</l>
      <l n="43">For that was the great place , the sacred place ,</l>
      <l n="44">That was a portion of the light of God ,</l>
      <l n="45">And from behind that door Hosannas rang .</l>
      <l n="46">The winding-sheet was red , and Canute stopped .</l>
      <l n="47">This is why Canute from the light of day</l>
      <l n="48">Draws ever back , and hath not dared appear</l>
      <l n="49">Before the Judge whose face is as the sun .</l>
      <l n="50">This is why still remaineth the dark king</l>
      <l n="51">Out in the night , and never having power</l>
      <l n="52">To bring his robe back to its first pure state ,</l>
      <l n="53">But feeling at each step a blood-drop fall ,</l>
      <l n="54">Wanders eternally ‘ neath the vast black heaven .</l>

     <l n="4">Model of bravery and purity .</l>
     <l n="5">His blood he spared not ; ready day or night</l>
     <l n="6">To punish crime , his dauntless sword shone bright</l>
     <l n="7">In his unblemished hand ; holy and white</l>
     <l n="8">And loyal all his noble life had been ,</l>
     <l n="9">A Christian Samson coming on the scene .</l>
     <l n="10">With fist alone the gate he battered down</l>

     <l n="12">‘ Twas he , indignant at the honor paid</l>

     <l n="19">Blazon the noble deeds that so abound</l>
     <l n="20">From Altorf unto Chaux-de-Fonds , and say ,</l>
     <l n="21">When he rests musing in a dreamy way ,</l>
     <l n="22">“ Behold , ‘ tis Charlemagne ! ” Tawny to see</l>
     <l n="23">And hairy , and seven feet high was he ,</l>
     <l n="24">Like John of Bourbon . Roaming hill or wood</l>
     <l n="25">He looked a wolf was striving to do good .</l>
     <l n="26">Bound up in duty , he of naught complained ,</l>
     <l n="27">The cry for help his aid at once obtained .</l>
     <l n="28">Only he mourned the baseness of mankind ,</l>
     <l n="29">And — that the beds too short he still doth find .</l>
     <l n="30">When people suffer under cruel kings ,</l>
     <l n="31">With pity moved , he to them succor brings .</l>
     <l n="32">‘ Twas he defended Alix from her foes</l>
     <l n="33">As sword of Urraca — he ever shows</l>
     <l n="34">His strength is for the feeble and oppressed ;</l>
     <l n="35">Father of orphans he , and all distressed !</l>
     <l n="36">Kings of the Rhine in strongholds were by him</l>
     <l n="37">Boldly attacked , and tyrant barons grim .</l>
     <l n="38">He freed the towns — confronting in his lair</l>
     <l n="39">Hugo the Eagle ; boldly did he dare</l>
     <l n="40">To break the collar of Saverne , the ring</l>
     <l n="41">Of Colmar , and the iron torture thing</l>
     <l n="42">Of Schlestadt , and the chain that Haguenau bore .</l>
     <l n="43">Such Eviradnus was a wrong before ,</l>
     <l n="44">Good but most terrible . In the dread scale</l>
     <l n="45">Which princes weighted with their horrid tale</l>
     <l n="46">Of craft and violence , and blood and ill ,</l>
     <l n="47">And fire and shocking deeds , his sword was still</l>
     <l n="48">God 's counterpoise displayed . Ever alert</l>
     <l n="49">More evil from the wretched to avert ,</l>
     <l n="50">Those hapless ones who ‘ neath Heaven 's vault at night</l>
     <l n="51">Raise suppliant hands . His lance loved not the plight</l>
     <l n="52">Of mouldering in the rack , of no avail ,</l>
     <l n="53">His battle-axe slipped from supporting nail</l>
     <l n="54">Quite easily ; ‘ twas ill for action base</l>
     <l n="55">To come so near that he the thing could trace .</l>
     <l n="56">The steel-clad champion death drops all around</l>
     <l n="57">As glaciers water . Hero ever found</l>
     <l n="58">Eviradnus is kinsman of the race</l>
     <l n="59">Of Amadys of Gaul , and knights of Thrace ,</l>
     <l n="60">He smiles at age . For he who never asked</l>
     <l n="61">For quarter from mankind — shall he be tasked</l>
     <l n="62">To beg of Time for mercy ? Rather he</l>
     <l n="63">Would girdle up his loins , like Baldwin be .</l>
     <l n="64">Aged he is , but of a lineage rare ;</l>
     <l n="65">The least intrepid of the birds that dare</l>
     <l n="66">Is not the eagle barbed . What matters age ,</l>
     <l n="67">The years but fire him with a holy rage .</l>
     <l n="68">Though late from Palestine , he is not spent ,—</l>
     <l n="69">With age he wrestles , firm in his intent .</l>

     <l n="4">Arose to view ; in that deserted place</l>
     <l n="5">A lone , abandoned hall with light aglow</l>
     <l n="6">The long neglect of centuries did show .</l>
     <l n="7">The castle-towers of Corbus in decay</l>
     <l n="8">Were girt by weeds and growths that had their way .</l>

     <l n="18">Its murmuring growl when pecking in their greed</l>
     <l n="19">The mulberries ripe . With insolence the thorn</l>
     <l n="20">Thrives on the desolation so forlorn .</l>
     <l n="21">But winter brings revenges ; then the Keep</l>
     <l n="22">Wakes all vindictive from its seeming sleep ,</l>
     <l n="23">Hurls down the heavy rain , night after night ,</l>
     <l n="24">Thanking the season 's all-resistless might ;</l>
     <l n="25">And , when the gutters choke , its gargoyles four</l>

     <l n="54">From their eight pinnacles the gorgons bay ,</l>
     <l n="55">And scattered monsters , in their stony way ,</l>
     <l n="56">Are growling heard ; the rampart lions gnaw</l>
     <l n="57">The misty air and slush with granite maw ,</l>
     <l n="58">The sleet upon the griffins spits , and all</l>
     <l n="59">The Saurian monsters , answering to the squall ,</l>
     <l n="60">Flap wings ; while through the broken ceiling fall</l>
     <l n="61">Torrents of rain upon the forms beneath ,</l>
     <l n="62">Dragons and snak 'd Medusas gnashing teeth</l>
     <l n="63">In the dismantled rooms . Like armored knight</l>
     <l n="64">The granite Castle fights with all its might ,</l>
     <l n="65">Resisting through the winter . All in vain ,</l>
     <l n="66">The heaven 's bluster , January 's rain ,</l>
     <l n="67">And those dread elemental powers we call</l>
     <l n="68">The Infinite — the whirlwinds that appall —</l>
     <l n="69">Thunder and waterspouts ; and winds that shake</l>
     <l n="70">As ‘ twere a tree its ripened fruit to take .</l>
     <l n="71">The winds grow wearied , warring with the tower ,</l>
     <l n="72">The noisy North is out of breath , nor power</l>
     <l n="73">Has any blast old Corbus to defeat ,</l>
     <l n="74">It still has strength their onslaughts worst to meet .</l>
     <l n="75">Thus , spite of briers and thistles , the old tower</l>
     <l n="76">Remains triumphant through the darkest hour ;</l>
     <l n="77">Superb as pontiff , in the forest shown ,</l>
     <l n="78">Its rows of battlements make triple crown ;</l>
     <l n="79">At eve , its silhouette is finely traced</l>
     <l n="80">Immense and black — showing the Keep is placed</l>
     <l n="81">On rocky throne , sublime and high ; east , west ,</l>
     <l n="82">And north and south , at corners four , there rest</l>
     <l n="83">Four mounts ; Aptar , where flourishes the pine ,</l>
     <l n="84">And Toxis , where the elms grow green and fine ;</l>
     <l n="85">Crobius and Bleyda , giants in their might ,</l>
     <l n="86">Against the stormy winds to stand and fight ,</l>
     <l n="87">And these above its diadem uphold</l>
     <l n="88">Night 's living canopy of clouds unrolled .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="89">The herdsman fears , and thinks its shadow creeps</l>
     <l n="90">To follow him ; and superstition keeps</l>
     <l n="91">Such hold that Corbus as a terror reigns ;</l>
     <l n="92">Folks say the Fort a target still remains</l>
     <l n="93">For the Black Archer — and that it contains</l>
     <l n="94">The cave where the Great Sleeper still sleeps sound .</l>
     <l n="95">The country people all the castle round</l>
     <l n="96">Are frightened easily , for legends grow</l>
     <l n="97">And mix with phantoms of the mind ; we know</l>
     <l n="98">The hearth is cradle of such fantasies ,</l>
     <l n="99">And in the smoke the cotter sees arise</l>
     <l n="100">From low-thatched but he traces cause of dread .</l>
     <l n="101">Thus rendering thanks that he is lowly bred ,</l>
     <l n="102">Because from such none look for valorous deeds .</l>
     <l n="103">The peasant flies the Tower , although it leads</l>
     <l n="104">A noble knight to seek adventure there ,</l>
     <l n="105">And , from his point of honor , dangers dare .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="106">Thus very rarely passer-by is seen ;</l>
     <l n="107">But — it might be with twenty years between ,</l>
     <l n="108">Or haply less — at unfixed interval</l>
     <l n="109">There would a semblance be of festival .</l>
     <l n="110">A Seneschal and usher would appear ,</l>
     <l n="111">And troops of servants many baskets bear .</l>
     <l n="112">Then were , in mystery , preparations made ,</l>
     <l n="113">And they departed — for till night none stayed .</l>
     <l n="114">But ‘ twixt the branches gazers could descry</l>
     <l n="115">The blackened hall lit up most brilliantly .</l>
     <l n="116">None dared approach — and this the reason why .</l>

    <head>THE CUSTOM OF LUSACE .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">When died a noble Marquis of Lusace</l>
     <l n="2">‘ Twas custom for the heir who filled his place</l>
     <l n="3">Before assuming princely pomp and power</l>
     <l n="4">To sup one night in Corbus ’ olden tower .</l>
     <l n="5">From this weird meal he passed to the degree</l>
     <l n="6">Of Prince and Margrave ; nor could ever he</l>
     <l n="7">Be thought brave knight , or she — if woman claim</l>
     <l n="8">The rank — be reckoned of unblemished fame</l>
     <l n="9">Till they had breathed the air of ages gone ,</l>
     <l n="10">The funeral odors , in the nest alone</l>
     <l n="11">Of its dead masters . Ancient was the race ;</l>
     <l n="12">To trace the upward stem of proud Lusace</l>
     <l n="13">Gives one a vertigo ; descended they</l>
     <l n="14">From ancestor of Attila , men say ;</l>
     <l n="15">Their race to him — through Pagans — they hark back ;</l>
     <l n="16">Becoming Christians , race they thought to track</l>
     <l n="17">Through Lechus , Plato , Otho to combine</l>
     <l n="18">With Ursus , Stephen , in a lordly line .</l>
     <l n="19">Of all those masters of the country round</l>
     <l n="20">That were on Northern Europe 's boundary found —</l>
     <l n="21">At first were waves and then the dykes were reared —</l>
     <l n="22">Corbus in double majesty appeared ,</l>
     <l n="23">Castle on hill and town upon the plain ;</l>
     <l n="24">And one who mounted on the tower could gain</l>
     <l n="25">A view beyond the pines and rocks , of spires</l>
     <l n="26">That pierce the shade the distant scene acquires ;</l>
     <l n="27">A walled town is it , but ‘ tis not ally</l>
     <l n="28">Of the old citadel 's proud majesty ;</l>
     <l n="29">Unto itself belonging this remained .</l>
     <l n="30">Often a castle was thus self-sustained</l>
     <l n="31">And equalled towns ; witness in Lombardy</l>
     <l n="32">Crama , and Plato too in Tuscany ,</l>
     <l n="33">And in Apulia Barletta ;— each one</l>
     <l n="34">Was powerful as a town , and dreaded none .</l>
     <l n="35">Corbus ranked thus ; its precincts seemed to hold</l>
     <l n="36">The reflex of its mighty kings of old ;</l>
     <l n="37">Their great events had witness in these walls ,</l>
     <l n="38">Their marriages were here and funerals ,</l>
     <l n="39">And mostly here it was that they were born ;</l>
     <l n="40">And here crowned Barons ruled with pride and scorn ;</l>
     <l n="41">Cradle of Scythian majesty this place .</l>
     <l n="42">Now each new master of this ancient race</l>
     <l n="43">A duty owed to ancestors which he</l>
     <l n="44">Was bound to carry on . The law 's decree</l>
     <l n="45">It was that he should pass alone the night</l>
     <l n="46">Which made him king , as in their solemn sight .</l>
     <l n="47">Just at the forest 's edge a clerk was met</l>
     <l n="48">With wine in sacred cup and purpose set ,</l>
     <l n="49">A wine mysterious , which the heir must drink</l>
     <l n="50">To cause deep slumber till next day 's soft brink .</l>
     <l n="51">Then to the castle tower he wends his way ,</l>
     <l n="52">And finds a supper laid with rich display .</l>
     <l n="53">He sups and sleeps : then to his slumbering eyes</l>
     <l n="54">The shades of kings from Bela all arise .</l>
     <l n="55">None dare the tower to enter on this night ,</l>
     <l n="56">But when the morning dawns , crowds are in sight</l>
     <l n="57">The dreamer to deliver ,— whom half dazed ,</l>
     <l n="58">And with the visions of the night amazed ,</l>
     <l n="59">They to the old church take , where rests the dust</l>
     <l n="60">Of Borivorus ; then the bishop must ,</l>
     <l n="61">With fervent blessings on his eyes and mouth ,</l>
     <l n="62">Put in his hands the stony hatchets both ,</l>
     <l n="63">With which — even like death impartially —</l>
     <l n="64">Struck Attila , with one arm dexterously</l>
     <l n="65">The south , and with the other arm the north .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="66">This day the town the threatening flag set forth</l>
     <l n="67">Of Marquis Swantibore , the monster he</l>
     <l n="68">Who in the wood tied up his wife , to be</l>
     <l n="69">Devoured by wolves , together with the bull</l>
     <l n="70">Of which with jealousy his heart was full .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="71">Even when woman took the place of heir</l>
     <l n="72">The tower of Corbus claimed the supper there ;</l>
     <l n="73">‘ Twas law — the woman trembled , but must dare .</l>

    <head>THE MARCHIONESS MAHAUD .</head>
     <l n="1">Niece of the Marquis — John the Striker named —</l>
     <l n="2">Mahaud to-day the marquisate has claimed .</l>
     <l n="3">A noble dame — the crown is hers by right :</l>
     <l n="4">As woman she has graces that delight .</l>
     <l n="5">A queen devoid of beauty is not queen ,</l>
     <l n="6">She needs the royalty of beauty 's mien ;</l>
     <l n="7">God in His harmony has equal ends</l>
     <l n="8">For cedar that resists , and reed that bends ,</l>
     <l n="9">And good it is a woman sometimes rules ,</l>
     <l n="10">Holds in her hand the power , and manners schools ,</l>
     <l n="11">And laws and mind ;— succeeding master proud ,</l>
     <l n="12">With gentle voice and smile she leads the crowd ,</l>
     <l n="13">The sombre human troop . But sweet Mahaud</l>
     <l n="14">On evil days had fallen ; gentle , good ,</l>
     <l n="15">Alas ! she held the sceptre like a flower ;</l>
     <l n="16">Timid yet gay , imprudent for the hour ,</l>
     <l n="17">And careless too . With Europe all in throes ,</l>
     <l n="18">Though twenty years she now already knows ,</l>
     <l n="19">She has refused to marry , although oft</l>
     <l n="20">Entreated . It is time an arm less soft</l>
     <l n="21">Than hers — a manly arm — supported her ;</l>
     <l n="22">Like to the rainbow she , one might aver ,</l>
     <l n="23">Shining on high between the cloud and rain ,</l>
     <l n="24">Or like the ewe that gambols on the plain</l>
     <l n="25">Between the bear and tiger ; innocent ,</l>
     <l n="26">She has two neighbors of most foul intent :</l>

    <head>THE TWO NEIGHBORS .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">The difference this betwixt the evil pair ,</l>
     <l n="2">Faithless to God — for laws without a care —</l>
     <l n="3">One was the claw , the other one the will</l>
     <l n="4">Controlling . Yet to mass they both went still ,</l>
     <l n="5">And on the rosary told their beads each day .</l>
     <l n="6">But none the less the world believed that they</l>
     <l n="7">Unto the powers of hell their souls had sold .</l>
     <l n="8">Even in whispers men each other told</l>
     <l n="9">The details of the pact which they had signed</l>
     <l n="10">With that dark power , the foe of human kind ;</l>
     <l n="11">In whispers , for the crowd had mortal dread</l>
     <l n="12">Of them so high , and woes that they had spread .</l>
     <l n="13">One might be vengeance and the other hate ,</l>
     <l n="14">Yet lived they side by side , in powerful state</l>
     <l n="15">And close alliance . All the people near</l>
     <l n="16">From red horizon dwelt in abject fear ,</l>
     <l n="17">Mastered by them ; their figures darkly grand</l>
     <l n="18">Had ruddy reflex from the wasted land ,</l>
     <l n="19">And fires , and towns they sacked . Besides the one ,</l>
     <l n="20">Like David , poet was , the other shone</l>
     <l n="21">As fine musician — rumor spread their fame ,</l>
     <l n="22">Declaring them divine , until each name</l>
     <l n="23">In Italy 's fine sonnets met with praise .</l>
     <l n="24">The ancient hierarch in those old days</l>
     <l n="25">Had custom strange , a now forgotten thing ,</l>
     <l n="26">It was a European plan that King</l>
     <l n="27">Of France was marquis , and th ’ imperial head</l>
     <l n="28">Of Germany was duke ; there was no need</l>
     <l n="29">To class the other kings , but barons they ,</l>
     <l n="30">Obedient vassals unto Rome , their stay .</l>
     <l n="31">The King of Poland was but simple knight ,</l>
     <l n="32">Yet now , for once , had strange unwonted right ,</l>
     <l n="33">And , as exception to the common state ,</l>
     <l n="34">This one Sarmatian King was held as great</l>
     <l n="35">As German Emperor ; and each knew how</l>
     <l n="36">His evil part to play , nor mercy show .</l>
     <l n="37">The German had one aim , it was to take</l>
     <l n="38">All land he could , and it his own to make .</l>
     <l n="39">The Pole already having Baltic shore ,</l>
     <l n="40">Seized Celtic ports , still needing more and more .</l>
     <l n="41">On all the Northern Sea his crafts roused fear :</l>
     <l n="42">Iceland beheld his demon navy near .</l>
     <l n="43">Antwerp the German burnt ; and Prussias twain</l>
     <l n="44">Bowed to the yoke . The Polish King was fain</l>
     <l n="45">To help the Russian Spotocus — his aid</l>
     <l n="46">Was like the help that in their common trade</l>
     <l n="47">A sturdy butcher gives a weaker one .</l>
     <l n="48">The King it is who seizes , and this done ,</l>
     <l n="49">The Emp'ror pillages , usurping right</l>
     <l n="50">In war Teutonic , settled but by might .</l>
     <l n="51">The King in Jutland cynic footing gains ,</l>
     <l n="52">The weak coerced , the while with cunning pains</l>
     <l n="53">The strong are duped . But ‘ tis a law they make</l>
     <l n="54">That their accord themselves should never break .</l>
     <l n="55">From Arctic seas to cities Transalpine ,</l>
     <l n="56">Their hideous talons , curved for sure rapine ,</l>
     <l n="57">Scrape o'er and o'er the mournful continent ,</l>
     <l n="58">Their plans succeed , and each is well content .</l>
     <l n="59">Thus under Satan 's all paternal care</l>
     <l n="60">They brothers are , this royal bandit pair .</l>
     <l n="61">Oh , noxious conquerors ! with transient rule</l>
     <l n="62">Chimera heads — ambition can but fool .</l>
     <l n="63">Their misty minds but harbor rottenness</l>
     <l n="64">Loathsome and fetid , and all barrenness —</l>
     <l n="65">Their deeds to ashes turn , and , hydra-bred ,</l>
     <l n="66">The mystic skeleton is theirs to dread .</l>
     <l n="67">The daring German and the cunning Pole</l>
     <l n="68">Noted to-day a woman had control</l>
     <l n="69">Of lands , and watched Mahaud like evil spies ;</l>
     <l n="70">And from the Emp'ror ' s cruel mouth — with dyes</l>
     <l n="71">Of wrath empurpled — came these words of late :</l>
     <l n="72">“ The empire wearies of the wallet weight</l>
     <l n="73">Hung at its back — this High and Low Lusace ,</l>
     <l n="74">Whose hateful load grows heavier apace ,</l>
     <l n="75">That now a woman holds its ruler 's place . ”</l>
     <l n="76">Threatening , and blood suggesting , every word ;</l>
     <l n="77">The watchful Pole was silent — but he heard .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="78">Two monstrous dangers ; but the heedless one</l>
     <l n="79">Babbles and smiles , and bids all care begone —</l>
     <l n="80">Likes lively speech — while all the poor she makes</l>
     <l n="81">To love her , and the taxes off she takes .</l>
     <l n="82">A life of dance and pleasure she has known —</l>
     <l n="83">A woman always ; in her jewelled crown</l>
     <l n="84">It is the pearl she loves — not cutting gems ,</l>
     <l n="85">For these can wound , and mark men 's diadems .</l>
     <l n="86">She pays the hire of Homer 's copyists ,</l>
     <l n="87">And in the Courts of Love presiding , lists .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="88">Quite recently unto her Court have come</l>
     <l n="89">Two men — unknown their names or native home ,</l>
     <l n="90">Their rank or race ; but one plays well the lute ,</l>
     <l n="91">The other is a troubadour ; both suit</l>
     <l n="92">The taste of Mahaud , when on summer eve ,</l>
     <l n="93">‘ Neath opened windows , they obtain her leave</l>
     <l n="94">To sing upon the terrace , and relate</l>
     <l n="95">The charming tales that do with music mate .</l>
     <l n="96">In August the Moravians have their fête ,</l>
     <l n="97">But it is radiant June in which Lusace</l>
     <l n="98">Must consecrate her noble Margrave race .</l>
     <l n="99">Thus in the weird and old ancestral tower</l>
     <l n="100">For Mahaud now has come the fateful hour ,</l>
     <l n="101">The lonely supper which her state decrees .</l>
     <l n="102">What matters this to flowers , and birds , and trees ,</l>
     <l n="103">And clouds and fountains ? That the people may</l>
     <l n="104">Still bear their yoke — have kings to rule alway ?</l>
     <l n="105">The water flows , the wind in passing by</l>
     <l n="106">In murmuring tones takes up the questioning cry .</l>

     <l n="1">The old stupendous hall has but one door ,</l>
     <l n="2">And in the dusk it seems that more and more</l>
     <l n="3">The walls recede in space unlimited .</l>
     <l n="4">At the far end there is a table spread</l>
     <l n="5">That in the dreary void with splendor shines ;</l>
     <l n="6">For ceiling we behold but rafter lines .</l>
     <l n="7">The table is arranged for one sole guest ,</l>
     <l n="8">A solitary chair doth near it rest ,</l>
     <l n="9">Throne-like , ‘ neath canopy that droopeth down</l>
     <l n="10">From the black beams ; upon the walls are shown</l>
     <l n="11">The painted histories of the olden might ,</l>

     <l n="13">On land with Nimrod , and on ocean wide</l>

     <l n="33">To make a love feast . All the napery</l>
     <l n="34">Was Friesland 's famous make ; and fair to see</l>
     <l n="35">The dishes , silver-gilt and bordered round</l>
     <l n="36">With flowers ; for fruit , here strawberries were found</l>
     <l n="37">And citrons , apples too , and nectarines .</l>
     <l n="38">The wooden bowls were carved in cunning lines</l>
     <l n="39">By peasants of the Murg , whose skilful hands</l>
     <l n="40">With patient toil reclaim the barren lands</l>
     <l n="41">And make their gardens flourish on a rock ,</l>
     <l n="42">Or mountain where we see the hunters flock .</l>
     <l n="43">Gold fountain-cup , with handles Florentine ,</l>
     <l n="44">Shows Acteons horned , though armed and booted fine ,</l>
     <l n="45">Who fight with sword in hand against the hounds .</l>
     <l n="46">Roses and gladioles make up bright mounds</l>
     <l n="47">Of flowers , with juniper and aniseed ;</l>
     <l n="48">While sage , all newly cut for this great need ,</l>
     <l n="49">Covers the Persian carpet that is spread</l>
     <l n="50">Beneath the table , and so helps to shed</l>
     <l n="51">Around a perfume of the balmy spring .</l>
     <l n="52">Beyond is desolation withering .</l>
     <l n="53">One hears within the hollow dreary space</l>
     <l n="54">Across the grove , made fresh by summer 's grace ,</l>
     <l n="55">The wind that ever is with mystic might</l>
     <l n="56">A spirit ripple of the Infinite .</l>
     <l n="57">The glass restored to frames to creak is made</l>
     <l n="58">By blustering wind that comes from neighboring glade .</l>
     <l n="59">Strange in this dream-like place , so drear and lone ,</l>
     <l n="60">The guest expected should be living one !</l>
     <l n="61">The seven lights from seven arms make glow</l>
     <l n="62">Almost with life the staring eyes that show</l>
     <l n="63">On the dim frescoes — and along the walls</l>
     <l n="64">Is here and there a stool , or the light falls</l>
     <l n="65">O'er some long chest , with likeness to a tomb .</l>
     <l n="66">Yet was displayed amid the mournful gloom</l>
     <l n="67">Some copper vessels , and some crockery ware .</l>
     <l n="68">The door — as if it must , yet scarcely dare —</l>
     <l n="69">Had opened widely to the night 's fresh air .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="70">No voice is heard , for man has fled the place ;</l>
     <l n="71">But Terror crouches in the corners ’ space ,</l>
     <l n="72">And waits the coming guest . This banquet hall</l>
     <l n="73">Of Titans is so high , that he who shall</l>
     <l n="74">With wandering eye look up from beam to beam</l>
     <l n="75">Of the confused wild roof will haply seem</l>
     <l n="76">To wonder that the stars he sees not there .</l>
     <l n="77">Giants the spiders are , that weave with care</l>
     <l n="78">Their hideous webs , which float the joists amid ,</l>
     <l n="79">Joists whose dark ends in griffins ’ jaws are hid .</l>
     <l n="80">The light is lurid , and the air like death ,</l>
     <l n="81">And dark and foul . Even Night holds its breath</l>
     <l n="82">Awhile . One might suppose the door had fear</l>
     <l n="83">To move its double leaves — their noise to hear .</l>

     <l n="4">Or table lone with stately daïs near —</l>
     <l n="5">Two rows of arches o'er a colonnade</l>
     <l n="6">With knights on horseback all in mail arrayed ,</l>
     <l n="7">Each one disposed with pillar at his back</l>
     <l n="8">And to another vis-à-vis . Nor lack</l>
     <l n="9">The fittings all complete ; in each right hand</l>
     <l n="10">A lance is seen ; the armored horses stand</l>
     <l n="11">With chamfrons laced , and harness buckled sure ;</l>
     <l n="12">The cuissarts ’ studs are by their clamps secure ;</l>
     <l n="13">The dirks stand out upon the saddle-bow ;</l>

     <l n="16">The gorget and the spurs with bronze tongues hasped ,</l>
     <l n="17">The shining long sword from the saddle hung ,</l>
     <l n="18">The battle-axe across the back was flung .</l>
     <l n="19">Under the arm a trusty dagger rests ,</l>
     <l n="20">Each spiked knee-piece its murderous power attests .</l>
     <l n="21">Feet press the stirrups — hands on bridle shown</l>

     <l n="1">Quite suddenly there showed across the door ,</l>
     <l n="2">Three heads which all a festive aspect wore .</l>
     <l n="3">Two men were there ; and , dressed in cloth of gold ,</l>
     <l n="4">A woman . Of the men one might have told</l>
     <l n="5">Some thirty years , the other younger seemed ,</l>
     <l n="6">Was tall and fair , and from his shoulder gleamed</l>
     <l n="7">A gay guitar with ivy leaves enlaced .</l>
     <l n="8">The other man was dark , but pallid-faced</l>
     <l n="9">And small . At the first glance they seemed to be</l>
     <l n="10">But made of perfume and frivolity .</l>
     <l n="11">Handsome they were , but through their comely mien</l>
     <l n="12">A grinning demon might be clearly seen .</l>
     <l n="13">April has flowers where lurk the slugs between .</l>

     <l n="14">“ Big Joss and little Zeno , pray come here ;</l>

     <l n="16">Madame Mahaud was speaker . Moonlight there</l>
     <l n="17">Caressingly enhanced her beauty rare ,</l>
     <l n="18">Making it shine and tremble , as if she</l>
     <l n="19">So soft and gentle were of things that be</l>
     <l n="20">Of air created , and are brought and ta'en</l>
     <l n="21">By heavenly flashes . Now , she spoke again</l>

     <l n="25">I should have died of fright outright I know . ”</l>
     <l n="26">The moonbeams through the open door did fall ,</l>

     <l n="52">“ Sing , if you will — but do not speak so loud ;</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="59">Then Mahaud shuddered , and she said : “ The wine</l>

    <head>THEY SUP .</head>
     <l n="1">With laugh and song they to the table went .</l>
     <l n="2">Said Mahaud gayly : “ It is my intent</l>
     <l n="3">To make Joss chamberlain . Zeno shall be</l>
     <l n="4">A constable supreme of high degree . ”</l>
     <l n="5">All three were joyous , and were fair to see .</l>
     <l n="6">Joss ate — and Zeno drank ; on stools the pair ,</l>
     <l n="7">With Mahaud musing in the regal chair .</l>
     <l n="8">The sound of separate leaf we do not note —</l>
     <l n="9">And so their babble seemed to idly float ,</l>
     <l n="10">And leave no thought behind . Now and again</l>
     <l n="11">Joss his guitar made trill with plaintive strain</l>
     <l n="12">Or Tyrolean air ; and lively tales they told</l>
     <l n="13">Mingled with mirth all free , and frank , and bold .</l>
     <l n="14">Said Mahaud : “ Do you know how fortunate</l>
     <l n="15">You are ? ” “ Yes , we are young at any rate —</l>
     <l n="16">Lovers half crazy — this is truth at least . ”</l>
     <l n="17">“ And more , for you know Latin like a priest ,</l>
     <l n="18">And Joss sings well . ”</l>
     <l n="19">“ Ah , yes , our master true ,</l>
     <l n="20">Yields us these gifts beyond the measure due . ”</l>
     <l n="21">“ Your master !— who is he ? ” Mahaud exclaimed .</l>
     <l n="22">“ Satan , we say — but Sin you 'd think him named , ”</l>
     <l n="23">Said Zeno , veiling words in raillery .</l>
     <l n="24">“ Do not laugh thus , ” she said with dignity ;</l>
     <l n="25">“ Peace , Zeno . Joss , you speak , my chamberlain . ”</l>
     <l n="26">“ Madame , Viridis , Countess of Milan ,</l>
     <l n="27">Was deemed superb ; Diana on the mount</l>
     <l n="28">Dazzled the shepherd boy ; ever we count</l>
     <l n="29">The Isabel of Saxony so fair ,</l>
     <l n="30">And Cleopatra 's beauty all so rare —</l>
     <l n="31">Aspasia 's , too , that must with theirs compare —</l>
     <l n="32">That praise of them no fitting language hath .</l>
     <l n="33">Divine was Rhodope — and Venus ’ wrath</l>
     <l n="34">Was such at Erylesis ’ perfect throat ,</l>
     <l n="35">She dragged her to the forge where Vulcan smote</l>
     <l n="36">Her beauty on his anvil . Well , as much</l>
     <l n="37">As star transcends a sequin , and just such</l>
     <l n="38">As temple is to rubbish-heap , I say ,</l>
     <l n="39">You do eclipse their beauty every way .</l>
     <l n="40">Those airy sprites that from the azure smile ,</l>
     <l n="41">Peris and elfs the while they men beguile ,</l>
     <l n="42">Have brows less youthful pure than yours ; besides</l>
     <l n="43">Dishevelled they whose shaded beauty hides</l>
     <l n="44">In clouds . ”</l>
     <l n="45">“ Flatt'rer , ” said Mahaud , “ you but sing</l>
     <l n="46">Too well . ”</l>
     <l n="47">Then Joss more homage sought to bring ;</l>
     <l n="48">“ If I were angel under heav'n , ” said he ,</l>
     <l n="49">“ Or girl or demon , I would seek to be</l>
     <l n="50">By you instructed in all art and grace ,</l>
     <l n="51">And as in school but take a scholar 's place .</l>
     <l n="52">Highness , you are a fairy bright , whose hand</l>
     <l n="53">For sceptre vile gave up your proper wand . ”</l>
     <l n="54">Fair Mahaud mused — then said , “ Be silent now ;</l>
     <l n="55">You seem to watch me ; little ‘ tis I know ,</l>
     <l n="56">Only that from Bohemia Joss doth come ,</l>
     <l n="57">And that in Poland Zeno hath his home .</l>
     <l n="58">But you amuse me ; I am rich , you poor —</l>
     <l n="59">What boon shall I confer and make secure ?</l>
     <l n="60">What gift ? ask of me , poets , what you will</l>
     <l n="61">And I will grant it — promise to fulfil . ”</l>
     <l n="62">“ A kiss , ” said Joss .</l>
     <l n="63">“ A kiss ! ” and anger fraught</l>
     <l n="64">Amazed at minstrel having such a thought —</l>
     <l n="65">While flush of indignation warmed her cheek .</l>
     <l n="66">“ You do forget to whom it is you speak , ”</l>
     <l n="67">She cried .</l>
     <l n="68">“ Had I not known your high degree ,</l>
     <l n="69">Should I have asked this royal boon , ” said he ,</l>
     <l n="70">“ Obtained or given , a kiss must ever be .</l>
     <l n="71">No gift like king 's — no kiss like that of queen ! ”</l>
     <l n="72">Queen ! And on Mahaud 's face a smile was seen .</l>

     <l n="1">Bearing the sleeping Mahaud they moved now</l>
     <l n="2">Silent and bent with heavy step and slow .</l>
     <l n="3">Zeno faced darkness — Joss turned towards the light —</l>

     <l n="2">Grown old upon the heights of Appenzel ,</l>
     <l n="3">When morning freshness breathes round all the wood ,</l>
     <l n="4">So Eviradnus now before them stood ,</l>
     <l n="5">Opening his visor , which at once revealed</l>
     <l n="6">The snowy beard it had so well concealed .</l>
     <l n="7">Thin Sigismond was still as dog at gaze ,</l>
     <l n="8">But Ladisläus leaped , and howl did raise ,</l>
     <l n="9">And laughed and gnashed his teeth , till , like a cloud</l>
     <l n="10">That sudden bursts , his rage was all avowed .</l>
     <l n="11">“ ‘ Tis but an old man after all ! ” he cried .</l>

     <l n="12">Then the great knight , who looked at both , replied ,</l>

     <l n="22">Then Eviradnus , true to his intent ,</l>

     <l n="24">He calmly had disarmed — with dexterous guile</l>
     <l n="25">Had Ladisläus seized a knife that lay</l>
     <l n="26">Upon the damask cloth , and slipped away</l>
     <l n="27">His shoes ; then barefoot , swiftly , silently</l>
     <l n="28">He crept behind the knight , with arm held high .</l>
     <l n="29">But Eviradnus was of all aware ,</l>

     <l n="9">When the broad table smoked like a perfumed censer ,</l>
     <l n="10">And its grateful odors the appetite increased .</l>
     <l n="11">The banquet was outspread in a hall , high as vast ,</l>

     <l n="29">Laughs at the holy writings and the text divine ,</l>
     <l n="30">O'er which the humble dervish prays and venerates .</l>
     <l n="31">There is a common saying which holds often good :</l>
     <l n="32">That cruel is he who is sparing in his cups .</l>
     <l n="33">That they are such as are most thirsty of man 's blood —</l>
     <l n="34">Yet he will see a slave beheaded whilst he sups .</l>
     <l n="35">But be this as it all may , glory gilds his reign ,</l>

     <l n="37">Asia as well — holding them both beneath a rain</l>
     <l n="38">Of bloody drops from scaffold , pyre , the stake , or rack ,</l>
     <l n="39">To leave his empire 's confines , one must run a race</l>
     <l n="40">Far past the river Baxtile southward ; in the north ,</l>
     <l n="41">To the rude , rocky , barren land of Thrace ,</l>
     <l n="42">Yet near enough to shudder when great Zim is wroth .</l>
     <l n="43">Conquering in every field , he finds delight</l>
     <l n="44">In battle-storms ; his music is the shout of camps .</l>
     <l n="45">On seeing him the eagle speeds away in fright ,</l>
     <l n="46">Whilst hid ‘ mong rocks , the grisly wolf its victim champs .</l>
     <l n="47">Mysore 's as well as Agra 's rajah is his kin ;</l>
     <l n="48">The great sheiks of the arid sands confess him lord ;</l>
     <l n="49">Omar , who vaunting cried : “ Through me doth Allah win ! ”</l>
     <l n="50">Was of his blood — a dreaded line of fire and sword .</l>
     <l n="51">The waters of Nagain , sands of Sahara warm ,</l>
     <l n="52">The Atlas and the Caucasus , snow-capped and lone ,</l>
     <l n="53">Mecca , Marcatta , these were massed in part to form</l>
     <l n="54">A portion of the giant shadow of Zim 's throne .</l>
     <l n="55">Before his might , to theirs , as hardest rock to dust ,</l>
     <l n="56">There have recoiled a horde of savage , warlike chiefs ,</l>
     <l n="57">Who have been into Afric 's fiery furnace thrust —</l>
     <l n="58">Its scorching heat to his rage greatest of reliefs .</l>
     <l n="59">There is no being but fears Zim ; to him bows down</l>
     <l n="60">Even the sainted Llama in the holy place ;</l>
     <l n="61">And the wild Kasburder chieftain at his dark power</l>
     <l n="62">Turns pale , and seeks a foeman of some lesser race .</l>
     <l n="63">Cities and states are bought and sold by Soudan Zim ,</l>

     <l n="1">A Lion in his jaws caught up a child —</l>
     <l n="2">Not harming it — and to the woodland , wild</l>

     <l n="4">The beast , as one might cull a bud in May .</l>
     <l n="5">It was a rosy boy , a king 's own pride ,</l>
     <l n="6">A ten-year lad , with bright eyes shining wide ,</l>
     <l n="7">And save this son his majesty beside</l>
     <l n="8">Had but one girl , two years of age , and so</l>

     <l n="13">By came a knight</l>
     <l n="14">That road , who halted , asking , “ What 's the fright ? ”</l>
     <l n="15">They told him , and he spurred straight for the site !</l>
     <l n="16">The beast was seen to smile ere joined they fight ,</l>
     <l n="17">The man and monster , in most desperate duel ,</l>
     <l n="18">Like warring giants , angry , huge , and cruel .</l>
     <l n="19">Stout though the knight , the lion stronger was ,</l>
     <l n="20">And tore that brave breast under its cuirass ,</l>
     <l n="21">Scrunching that hero , till he sprawled , alas !</l>
     <l n="22">Beneath his shield , all blood and mud and mess :</l>
     <l n="23">Whereat the lion feasted : then it went</l>
     <l n="24">Back to its rocky couch and slept content .</l>
     <l n="25">Sudden , loud cries and clamors ! striking out</l>
     <l n="26">Qualm to the heart of the quiet , horn and shout</l>
     <l n="27">Causing the solemn wood to reel with rout .</l>
     <l n="28">Terrific was this noise that rolled before ;</l>
     <l n="29">It seemed a squadron ; nay , ‘ twas something more —</l>
     <l n="30">A whole battalion , sent by that sad king</l>
     <l n="31">With force of arms his little prince to bring ,</l>

     <l n="36">Ranged in the order a great hunt should have ,</l>
     <l n="37">They soon between the trunks espy the cave .</l>
     <l n="38">“ Yes , that is it ! the very mouth of the den ! ”</l>
     <l n="39">The trees all round it muttered , warning men ;</l>
     <l n="40">Still they kept step and neared it . Look you now ,</l>
     <l n="41">Company 's pleasant , and there were a thou —</l>
     <l n="42">Good Lord ! all in a moment , there 's its face !</l>
     <l n="43">Frightful ! they saw the lion ! Not one pace</l>
     <l n="44">Further stirred any man ; but bolt and dart</l>
     <l n="45">Made target of the beast . He , on his part ,</l>
     <l n="46">As calm as Pelion in the rain or hail ,</l>
     <l n="47">Bristled majestic from the teeth to tail ,</l>
     <l n="48">And shook full fifty missiles from his hide ,</l>
     <l n="49">But no heed took he ; steadfastly he eyed ,</l>
     <l n="50">And roared a roar , hoarse , vibrant , vengeful , dread ,</l>
     <l n="51">A rolling , raging peal of wrath , which spread ,</l>
     <l n="52">Making the half-awakened thunder cry ,</l>
     <l n="53">“ Who thunders there ? ” from its black bed of sky .</l>
     <l n="54">This ended all ! Sheer horror cleared the coast ;</l>
     <l n="55">As fogs are driven by the wind , that valorous host</l>
     <l n="56">Melted , dispersed to all the quarters four ,</l>
     <l n="57">Clean panic-stricken by that monstrous roar .</l>
     <l n="58">Then quoth the lion , “ Woods and mountains , see ,</l>
     <l n="59">A thousand men , enslaved , fear one beast free ! ”</l>
     <l n="60">He followed towards the hill , climbed high above ,</l>
     <l n="61">Lifted his voice , and , as the sowers sow</l>
     <l n="62">The seed down wind , thus did that lion throw</l>
     <l n="63">His message far enough the town to reach :</l>
     <l n="64">“ King ! your behavior really passes speech !</l>
     <l n="65">Thus far no harm I 've wrought to him your son ;</l>
     <l n="66">But now I give you notice — when night 's done ,</l>
     <l n="67">I will make entry at your city-gate ,</l>
     <l n="68">Bringing the prince alive ; and those who wait</l>
     <l n="69">To see him in my jaws — your lackey-crew —</l>
     <l n="70">Shall see me eat him in your palace , too ! ”</l>
     <l n="71">Next morning , this is what was viewed in town :</l>
     <l n="72">Dawn coming — people going — some adown</l>
     <l n="73">Praying , some crying ; pallid cheeks , swift feet ,</l>
     <l n="74">And a huge lion stalking through the street .</l>
     <l n="75">It seemed scarce short of rash impiety</l>
     <l n="76">To cross its path as the fierce beast went by .</l>
     <l n="77">So to the palace and its gilded dome</l>
     <l n="78">With stately steps unchallenged did he roam ;</l>
     <l n="79">He enters it — within those walls he leapt !</l>
     <l n="80">No man !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="81">For certes , though he raged and wept ,</l>
     <l n="82">His majesty , like all , close shelter kept ,</l>
     <l n="83">Solicitous to live , holding his breath</l>
     <l n="84">Specially precious to the realm . Now death</l>
     <l n="85">Is not thus viewed by honest beasts of prey ;</l>
     <l n="86">And when the lion found him fled away ,</l>
     <l n="87">Ashamed to be so grand , man being so base ,</l>
     <l n="88">He muttered to himself , “ A wretched king !</l>
     <l n="89">‘ Tis well ; I 'll eat his boy ! ” Then , wandering ,</l>
     <l n="90">Lordly he traversed courts and corridors ,</l>
     <l n="91">Paced beneath vaults of gold on shining floors ,</l>
     <l n="92">Glanced at the throne deserted , stalked from hall</l>
     <l n="93">To hall — green , yellow , crimson — empty all !</l>
     <l n="94">Rich couches void , soft seats unoccupied !</l>
     <l n="95">And as he walked he looked from side to side</l>
     <l n="96">To find some pleasant nook for his repast ,</l>
     <l n="97">Since appetite was come to munch at last</l>
     <l n="98">The princely morsel !— Ah ! what sight astounds</l>
     <l n="99">That grisly lounger ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="100">In the palace grounds</l>
     <l n="101">An alcove on a garden gives , and there</l>
     <l n="102">A tiny thing — forgot in the general fear ,</l>
     <l n="103">Lulled in the flower-sweet dreams of infancy ,</l>
     <l n="104">Bathed with soft sunlight falling brokenly</l>
     <l n="105">Through leaf and lattice — was at that moment waking ;</l>
     <l n="106">A little lovely maid , most dear and taking ,</l>
     <l n="107">The prince 's sister — all alone , undressed —</l>
     <l n="108">She sat up singing : children sing so best .</l>
     <l n="109">Charming this beauteous baby-maid ; and so</l>
     <l n="110">The beast caught sight of her and stopped —</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="111">And then</l>
     <l n="112">Entered — the floor creaked as he stalked straight in .</l>
     <l n="113">Above the playthings by the little bed</l>
     <l n="114">The lion put his shaggy , massive head ,</l>
     <l n="115">Dreadful with savage might and lordly scorn ,</l>
     <l n="116">More dreadful with that princely prey so borne ;</l>
     <l n="117">Which she , quick spying , “ Brother , brother ! ” cried ,</l>
     <l n="118">“ Oh , my own brother ! ” and , unterrified ,</l>
     <l n="119">She gazed upon that monster of the wood ,</l>
     <l n="120">Whose yellow balls not Typhon had withstood ,</l>
     <l n="121">And — well ! who knows what thoughts these small heads hold ?</l>
     <l n="122">She rose up in her cot — full height , and bold ,</l>
     <l n="123">And shook her pink fist angrily at him .</l>
     <l n="124">Whereon — close to the little bed 's white rim ,</l>
     <l n="125">All dainty silk and laces — this huge brute</l>
     <l n="126">Set down her brother gently at her foot ,</l>
     <l n="127">Just as a mother might , and said to her ,</l>
     <l n="128">“ Do n't be put out , now ! There he is , dear , there ! ”</l>

     <l n="14">And though not twelve months old , he had a mind .</l>
     <l n="15">He recognized me — nay , knew me right well ,</l>
     <l n="16">And in my face would laugh — and that child-laugh ,</l>
     <l n="17">Oh , poor old man ! ‘ twas sunlight to my heart .</l>
     <l n="18">I meant him for a soldier , ay , a conqueror ,</l>
     <l n="19">And named him George . One day — oh , bitter thought !</l>
     <l n="20">The child played in the fields . When thou art mother ,</l>
     <l n="21">Ne'er let thy children out of sight to play !</l>
     <l n="22">The gypsies took him from me — oh , for what ?</l>
     <l n="23">Perhaps to kill him at a witch 's rite .</l>
     <l n="24">I weep !— now , after twenty years — I weep</l>
     <l n="25">As if ‘ twere yesterday . I loved him so !</l>
     <l n="26">I used to call him “ my own little king ! ”</l>
     <l n="27">I was intoxicated with my joy</l>
     <l n="28">When o'er my white beard ran his rosy hands ,</l>
     <l n="29">Thrilling me all through .</l>

   <p>The EMPEROR FREDERICK BARBAROSSA , believed to be dead , appearing as a beggar among the Rhenish nobility at a castle , suddenly reveals himself .</p>
   <p>HATTO . This goodly masque but lacked a fool ! First gypsy ; next a beggar ;— good ! Thy name ?</p>
   <p>BARBAROSSA . Frederick of Swabia , Emperor of Almain .</p>
   <p>ALL . The Red Beard ?</p>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">BARBAROSSA . Aye , Frederick , by my mountain birthright Prince</l>
     <l n="2">O ’ th ’ Romans , chosen king , crowned emperor ,</l>
     <l n="3">Heaven 's sword-bearer , monarch of Burgundy</l>
     <l n="4">And Arles — the tomb of Karl I dared profane ,</l>
     <l n="5">But have repented me on bended knees</l>
     <l n="6">In penance ‘ midst the desert twenty years ;</l>
     <l n="7">My drink the rain , the rocky herbs my food ,</l>
     <l n="8">Myself a ghost the shepherds fled before ,</l>
     <l n="9">And the world named me as among the dead .</l>
     <l n="10">But I have heard my country call — come forth ,</l>
     <l n="11">Lifted the shroud — broken the sepulchre .</l>
     <l n="12">This hour is one when dead men needs must rise .</l>
     <l n="13">Ye own me ? Ye mind me marching through these vales</l>
     <l n="14">When golden spur was ringing at my heel ?</l>
     <l n="15">Now know me what I am , your master , earls !</l>
     <l n="16">Brave knights you deem ! You say , “ The sons we are</l>
     <l n="17">Of puissant barons and great noblemen ,</l>
     <l n="18">Whose honors we prolong . ” You do prolong them ?</l>
     <l n="19">Your sires were soldiers brave , not prowlers base ,</l>
     <l n="20">Rogues , miscreants , felons , village-ravagers !</l>
     <l n="21">They made great wars , they rode like heroes forth ,</l>
     <l n="22">And , worthy , won broad lands and towers and towns ,</l>
     <l n="23">So firmly won that thirty years of strife</l>
     <l n="24">Made of their followers dukes , their leaders kings !</l>
     <l n="25">While you ! like jackal and the bird of prey ,</l>
     <l n="26">Who lurk in copses or ‘ mid muddy beds —</l>
     <l n="27">Crouching and hushed , with dagger ready drawn ,</l>
     <l n="28">Hide in the noisome marsh that skirts the way ,</l>
     <l n="29">Trembling lest passing hounds snuff out your lair !</l>
     <l n="30">Listen at eventide on lonesome path</l>
     <l n="31">For traveller 's footfall , or the mule-bell 's chime ,</l>
     <l n="32">Pouncing by hundreds on one helpless man ,</l>
     <l n="33">To cut him down , then back to your retreats —</l>
     <l n="34">You dare to vaunt your sires ? I call your sires ,</l>
     <l n="35">Bravest of brave and greatest ‘ mid the great ,</l>
     <l n="36">A line of warriors ! you , a pack of thieves !</l>
