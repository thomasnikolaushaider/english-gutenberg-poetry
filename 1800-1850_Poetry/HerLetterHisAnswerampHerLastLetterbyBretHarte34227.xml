  <body>
   <p>The first two of the poems here printed have long been popular favorites , but the third was not written till near the end of Mr. Harte 's life . It rounds out the romance with such completeness and charm that it is peculiarly fitting that the poems should be grouped , and issued in a form worthy of their own excellence . The cooperation of Mr. Keller was secured for making the illustrations , not only on account of his recognized ability as an artist , but also because of his admiration for Mr. Harte 's writings and his previous success in illustrating several of the stories .</p>
