    <head>THE PILGRIM 'S VISION</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">IN the hour of twilight shadows</l>
     <l n="2">The Pilgrim sire looked out ;</l>
     <l n="3">He thought of the “ bloudy Salvages ”</l>
     <l n="4">That lurked all round about ,</l>
     <l n="5">Of Wituwamet 's pictured knife</l>
     <l n="6">And Pecksuot 's whooping shout ;</l>
     <l n="7">For the baby 's limbs were feeble ,</l>
     <l n="8">Though his father 's arms were stout .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">His home was a freezing cabin ,</l>
     <l n="10">Too bare for the hungry rat ;</l>
     <l n="11">Its roof was thatched with ragged grass ,</l>
     <l n="12">And bald enough of that ;</l>
     <l n="13">The hole that served for casement</l>
     <l n="14">Was glazed with an ancient hat ,</l>
     <l n="15">And the ice was gently thawing</l>
     <l n="16">From the log whereon he sat .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="17">Along the dreary landscape</l>
     <l n="18">His eyes went to and fro ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="19">The trees all clad in icicles ,</l>
     <l n="20">The streams that did not flow ;</l>
     <l n="21">A sudden thought flashed o'er him ,—</l>
     <l n="22">A dream of long ago ,—</l>
     <l n="23">He smote his leathern jerkin ,</l>
     <l n="24">And murmured , “ Even so ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="25">“ Come hither , God-be-Glorified ,</l>
     <l n="26">And sit upon my knee ;</l>
     <l n="27">Behold the dream unfolding ,</l>
     <l n="28">Whereof I spake to thee</l>
     <l n="29">By the winter 's hearth in Leyden</l>
     <l n="30">And on the stormy sea .</l>
     <l n="31">True is the dream 's beginning ,—</l>
     <l n="32">So may its ending be !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="33">“ I saw in the naked forest</l>
     <l n="34">Our scattered remnant cast ,</l>
     <l n="35">A screen of shivering branches</l>
     <l n="36">Between them and the blast ;</l>
     <l n="37">The snow was falling round them ,</l>
     <l n="38">The dying fell as fast ;</l>
     <l n="39">I looked to see them perish ,</l>
     <l n="40">When lo , the vision passed .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="41">“ Again mine eyes were opened ;—</l>
     <l n="42">The feeble had waxed strong ,</l>
     <l n="43">The babes had grown to sturdy men ,</l>
     <l n="44">The remnant was a throng ;</l>
     <l n="45">By shadowed lake and winding stream ,</l>
     <l n="46">And all the shores along ,</l>
     <l n="47">The howling demons quaked to hear</l>
     <l n="48">The Christian 's godly song .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="49">“ They slept , the village fathers ,</l>
     <l n="50">By river , lake , and shore ,</l>
     <l n="51">When far adown the steep of Time</l>
     <l n="52">The vision rose once more</l>
     <l n="53">I saw along the winter snow</l>
     <l n="54">A spectral column pour ,</l>
     <l n="55">And high above their broken ranks</l>
     <l n="56">A tattered flag they bore .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="57">“ Their Leader rode before them ,</l>
     <l n="58">Of bearing calm and high ,</l>
     <l n="59">The light of Heaven 's own kindling</l>
     <l n="60">Throned in his awful eye ;</l>
     <l n="61">These were a Nation 's champions</l>
     <l n="62">Her dread appeal to try .</l>
     <l n="63">God for the right ! I faltered ,</l>
     <l n="64">And lo , the train passed by .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="65">“ Once more ;— the strife is ended ,</l>
     <l n="66">The solemn issue tried ,</l>
     <l n="67">The Lord of Hosts , his mighty arm</l>
     <l n="68">Has helped our Israel 's side ;</l>
     <l n="69">Gray stone and grassy hillock</l>
     <l n="70">Tell where our martyrs died ,</l>
     <l n="71">But peaceful smiles the harvest ,</l>
     <l n="72">And stainless flows the tide .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="73">“ A crash , as when some swollen cloud</l>
     <l n="74">Cracks o'er the tangled trees</l>
     <l n="75">With side to side , and spar to spar ,</l>
     <l n="76">Whose smoking decks are these ?</l>
     <l n="77">I know Saint George 's blood-red cross ,</l>
     <l n="78">Thou Mistress of the Seas ,</l>
     <l n="79">But what is she whose streaming bars</l>
     <l n="80">Roll out before the breeze ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="81">“ Ah , well her iron ribs are knit ,</l>
     <l n="82">Whose thunders strive to quell</l>
     <l n="83">The bellowing throats , the blazing lips ,</l>
     <l n="84">That pealed the Armada 's knell !</l>
     <l n="85">The mist was cleared ,— a wreath of stars</l>
     <l n="86">Rose o'er the crimsoned swell ,</l>
     <l n="87">And , wavering from its haughty peak ,</l>
     <l n="88">The cross of England fell !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="89">“ O trembling Faith ! though dark the morn ,</l>
     <l n="90">A heavenly torch is thine ;</l>
     <l n="91">While feebler races melt away ,</l>
     <l n="92">And paler orbs decline ,</l>
     <l n="93">Still shall the fiery pillar 's ray</l>
     <l n="94">Along thy pathway shine ,</l>
     <l n="95">To light the chosen tribe that sought</l>
     <l n="96">This Western Palestine .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="97">“ I see the living tide roll on ;</l>
     <l n="98">It crowns with flaming towers</l>
     <l n="99">The icy capes of Labrador ,</l>
     <l n="100">The Spaniard 's ‘ land of flowers ’ !</l>
     <l n="101">It streams beyond the splintered ridge</l>
     <l n="102">That parts the northern showers ;</l>
     <l n="103">From eastern rock to sunset wave</l>
     <l n="104">The Continent is ours ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="105">He ceased , the grim old soldier-saint ,</l>
     <l n="106">Then softly bent to cheer</l>
     <l n="107">The Pilgrim-child , whose wasting face</l>
     <l n="108">Was meekly turned to hear ;</l>
     <l n="109">And drew his toil-worn sleeve across</l>
     <l n="110">To brush the manly tear</l>
     <l n="111">From cheeks that never changed in woe ,</l>
     <l n="112">And never blanched in fear .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="113">The weary Pilgrim slumbers ,</l>
     <l n="114">His resting-place unknown ;</l>
     <l n="115">His hands were crossed , his lips were closed ,</l>
     <l n="116">The dust was o'er him strown ;</l>
     <l n="117">The drifting soil , the mouldering leaf ,</l>
     <l n="118">Along the sod were blown ;</l>
     <l n="119">His mound has melted into earth ,</l>
     <l n="120">His memory lives alone .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="121">So let it live unfading ,</l>
     <l n="122">The memory of the dead ,</l>
     <l n="123">Long as the pale anemone</l>
     <l n="124">Springs where their tears were shed ,</l>
     <l n="125">Or , raining in the summer 's wind</l>
     <l n="126">In flakes of burning red ,</l>
     <l n="127">The wild rose sprinkles with its leaves</l>
     <l n="128">The turf where once they bled !</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Yea , when the frowning bulwarks That guard this holy strand Have sunk beneath the trampling surge In beds of sparkling sand , While in the waste of ocean One hoary rock shall stand , Be this its latest legend ,— HERE WAS THE PILGRIM 'S LAND !</p>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>THE STEAMBOAT</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">SEE how yon flaming herald treads</l>
     <l n="2">The ridged and rolling waves ,</l>
     <l n="3">As , crashing o'er their crested heads ,</l>
     <l n="4">She bows her surly slaves !</l>
     <l n="5">With foam before and fire behind ,</l>
     <l n="6">She rends the clinging sea ,</l>
     <l n="7">That flies before the roaring wind ,</l>
     <l n="8">Beneath her hissing lee .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">The morning spray , like sea-born flowers ,</l>
     <l n="10">With heaped and glistening bells ,</l>
     <l n="11">Falls round her fast , in ringing showers ,</l>
     <l n="12">With every wave that swells ;</l>
     <l n="13">And , burning o'er the midnight deep ,</l>
     <l n="14">In lurid fringes thrown ,</l>
     <l n="15">The living gems of ocean sweep</l>
     <l n="16">Along her flashing zone .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="17">With clashing wheel and lifting keel ,</l>
     <l n="18">And smoking torch on high ,</l>
     <l n="19">When winds are loud and billows reel ,</l>
     <l n="20">She thunders foaming by ;</l>
     <l n="21">When seas are silent and serene ,</l>
     <l n="22">With even beam she glides ,</l>
     <l n="23">The sunshine glimmering through the green</l>
     <l n="24">That skirts her gleaming sides .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="25">Now , like a wild , nymph , far apart</l>
     <l n="26">She veils her shadowy form ,</l>
     <l n="27">The beating of her restless heart</l>
     <l n="28">Still sounding through the storm ;</l>
     <l n="29">Now answers , like a courtly dame ,</l>
     <l n="30">The reddening surges o'er ,</l>
     <l n="31">With flying scarf of spangled flame ,</l>
     <l n="32">The Pharos of the shore .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="33">To-night yon pilot shall not sleep ,</l>
     <l n="34">Who trims his narrowed sail ;</l>
     <l n="35">To-night yon frigate scarce shall keep</l>
     <l n="36">Her broad breast to the gale ;</l>
     <l n="37">And many a foresail , scooped and strained ,</l>
     <l n="38">Shall break from yard and stay ,</l>
     <l n="39">Before this smoky wreath has stained</l>
     <l n="40">The rising mist of day .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="41">Hark ! hark ! I hear yon whistling shroud ,</l>
     <l n="42">I see yon quivering mast ;</l>
     <l n="43">The black throat of the hunted cloud</l>
     <l n="44">Is panting forth the blast !</l>
     <l n="45">An hour , and , whirled like winnowing chaff ,</l>
     <l n="46">The giant surge shall fling</l>
     <l n="47">His tresses o'er yon pennon staff ,</l>
     <l n="48">White as the sea-bird 's wing .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="49">Yet rest , ye wanderers of the deep ;</l>
     <l n="50">Nor wind nor wave shall tire</l>
     <l n="51">Those fleshless arms , whose pulses leap</l>
     <l n="52">With floods of living fire ;</l>
     <l n="53">Sleep on , and , when the morning light</l>
     <l n="54">Streams o'er the shining bay ,</l>
     <l n="55">Oh think of those for whom the night</l>
     <l n="56">Shall never wake in day .</l>

    <head>LEXINGTON</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">SLOWLY the mist o'er the meadow was creeping ,</l>
     <l n="2">Bright on the dewy buds glistened the sun ,</l>
     <l n="3">When from his couch , while his children were sleeping ,</l>
     <l n="4">Rose the bold rebel and shouldered his gun .</l>
     <l n="5">Waving her golden veil</l>
     <l n="6">Over the silent dale ,</l>
     <l n="7">Blithe looked the morning on cottage and spire ;</l>
     <l n="8">Hushed was his parting sigh ,</l>
     <l n="9">While from his noble eye</l>
     <l n="10">Flashed the last sparkle of liberty 's fire .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="11">On the smooth green where the fresh leaf is springing</l>
     <l n="12">Calmly the first-born of glory have met ;</l>
     <l n="13">Hark ! the death-volley around them is ringing !</l>
     <l n="14">Look ! with their life-blood the young grass is wet</l>
     <l n="15">Faint is the feeble breath ,</l>
     <l n="16">Murmuring low in death ,</l>
     <l n="17">“ Tell to our sons how their fathers have died ; ”</l>
     <l n="18">Nerveless the iron hand ,</l>
     <l n="19">Raised for its native land ,</l>
     <l n="20">Lies by the weapon that gleams at its side .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="21">Over the hillsides the wild knell is tolling ,</l>
     <l n="22">From their far hamlets the yeomanry come ;</l>
     <l n="23">As through the storm-clouds the thunder-burst rolling ,</l>
     <l n="24">Circles the beat of the mustering drum .</l>
     <l n="25">Fast on the soldier 's path</l>
     <l n="26">Darken the waves of wrath ,—</l>
     <l n="27">Long have they gathered and loud shall they fall ;</l>
     <l n="28">Red glares the musket 's flash ,</l>
     <l n="29">Sharp rings the rifle 's crash ,</l>
     <l n="30">Blazing and clanging from thicket and wall .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="31">Gayly the plume of the horseman was dancing ,</l>
     <l n="32">Never to shadow his cold brow again ;</l>
     <l n="33">Proudly at morning the war-steed was prancing ,</l>
     <l n="34">Reeking and panting he droops on the rein ;</l>
     <l n="35">Pale is the lip of scorn ,</l>
     <l n="36">Voiceless the trumpet horn ,</l>
     <l n="37">Torn is the silken-fringed red cross on high ;</l>
     <l n="38">Many a belted breast</l>
     <l n="39">Low on the turf shall rest</l>
     <l n="40">Ere the dark hunters the herd have passed by .</l>

     <l n="41">Snow-girdled crags where the hoarse wind is raving ,</l>

     <l n="44">Reeled with the echoes that rode on the gale ;</l>
     <l n="45">Far as the tempest thrills</l>
     <l n="46">Over the darkened hills ,</l>
     <l n="47">Far as the sunshine streams over the plain ,</l>
     <l n="48">Roused by the tyrant band ,</l>

     <l n="55">Borne on her Northern pine ,</l>
     <l n="56">Long o'er the foaming brine</l>
     <l n="57">Spread her broad banner to storm and to sun ;</l>

    <head>ON LENDING A PUNCH-BOWL</head>
    <head>This “ punch-bowl ” was , according to old family tradition , a caudle-cup . It is a massive piece of silver , its cherubs and other ornaments of coarse repousse work , and has two handles like a loving-cup , by which it was held , or passed from guest to guest .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">THIS ancient silver bowl of mine , it tells of good old times ,</l>
     <l n="2">Of joyous days and jolly nights , and merry Christmas times ;</l>
     <l n="3">They were a free and jovial race , but honest , brave , and true ,</l>
     <l n="4">Who dipped their ladle in the punch when this old bowl was new .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">A Spanish galleon brought the bar ,— so runs the ancient tale ;</l>
     <l n="6">‘ T was hammered by an Antwerp smith , whose arm was like a flail ;</l>
     <l n="7">And now and then between the strokes , for fear his strength should fail ,</l>
     <l n="8">He wiped his brow and quaffed a cup of good old Flemish ale .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">‘ T was purchased by an English squire to please his loving dame ,</l>
     <l n="10">Who saw the cherubs , and conceived a longing for the same ;</l>
     <l n="11">And oft as on the ancient stock another twig was found ,</l>
     <l n="12">‘ T was filled with candle spiced and hot , and handed smoking round .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">But , changing hands , it reached at length a Puritan divine ,</l>
     <l n="14">Who used to follow Timothy , and take a little wine ,</l>
     <l n="15">But hated punch and prelacy ; and so it was , perhaps ,</l>
     <l n="16">He went to Leyden , where he found conventicles and schnapps .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="17">And then , of course , you know what 's next : it left the Dutchman 's shore</l>
     <l n="18">With those that in the Mayflower came ,— a hundred souls and more ,—</l>
     <l n="19">Along with all the furniture , to fill their new abodes ,—</l>
     <l n="20">To judge by what is still on hand , at least a hundred loads .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="21">‘ T was on a dreary winter 's eve , the night was closing , dim ,</l>
     <l n="22">When brave Miles Standish took the bowl , and filled it to the brim ;</l>
     <l n="23">The little Captain stood and stirred the posset with his sword ,</l>
     <l n="24">And all his sturdy men-at-arms were ranged about the board .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="25">He poured the fiery Hollands in ,— the man that never feared ,—</l>
     <l n="26">He took a long and solemn draught , and wiped his yellow beard ;</l>
     <l n="27">And one by one the musketeers — the men that fought and prayed —</l>
     <l n="28">All drank as ‘ t were their mother 's milk , and not a man afraid .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="29">That night , affrighted from his nest , the screaming eagle flew ,</l>
     <l n="30">He heard the Pequot 's ringing whoop , the soldier 's wild halloo ;</l>
     <l n="31">And there the sachem learned the rule he taught to kith and kin ,</l>
     <l n="32">Run from the white man when you find he smells of “ Hollands gin ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="33">A hundred years , and fifty more , had spread their leaves and snows ,</l>
     <l n="34">A thousand rubs had flattened down each little cherub 's nose ,</l>
     <l n="35">When once again the bowl was filled , but not in mirth or joy ,—</l>
     <l n="36">‘ T was mingled by a mother 's hand to cheer her parting boy .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="37">Drink , John , she said , ‘ t will do you good ,— poor child ,</l>
     <l n="38">you 'll never bear</l>
     <l n="39">This working in the dismal trench , out in the midnight air ;</l>
     <l n="40">And if — God bless me !— you were hurt , ‘ t would keep away the chill .</l>
     <l n="41">So John did drink ,— and well he wrought that night at Bunker 's Hill !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="42">I tell you , there was generous warmth in good old English cheer ;</l>
     <l n="43">I tell you , ‘ t was a pleasant thought to bring its symbol here .</l>
     <l n="44">‘ T is but the fool that loves excess ; hast thou a drunken soul ?</l>
     <l n="45">Thy bane is in thy shallow skull , not in my silver bowl !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="46">I love the memory of the past ,— its pressed yet fragrant flowers ,—</l>
     <l n="47">The moss that clothes its broken walls , the ivy on its towers ;</l>
     <l n="48">Nay , this poor bauble it bequeathed ,— my eyes grow moist and dim ,</l>
     <l n="49">To think of all the vanished joys that danced around its brim .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="50">Then fill a fair and honest cup , and bear it straight to me ;</l>
     <l n="51">The goblet hallows all it holds , whate'er the liquid be ;</l>
     <l n="52">And may the cherubs on its face protect me from the sin</l>
     <l n="53">That dooms one to those dreadful words ,— “ My dear , where HAVE you been ? ”</l>

    <head>A SONG</head>
    <head>FOR THE CENTENNIAL CELEBRATION OF HARVARD COLLEGE , 1836</head>
    <head>This song , which I had the temerity to sing myself ( felix auda-cia , Mr. Franklin Dexter had the goodness to call it ) , was sent in a little too late to be printed with the official account of the celebration . It was written at the suggestion of Dr. Jacob Bigelow , who thought the popular tune “ The Poacher 's Song ” would be a good model for a lively ballad or ditty . He himself wrote the admirable Latin song to be found in the record of the meeting .</head>

     <l n="12">Whene'er a babe was born ,</l>
     <l n="13">The rattlesnakes were bigger round</l>

    <head>THE ISLAND HUNTING-SONG</head>
    <head>The island referred to is a domain of princely proportions , which has long been the seat of a generous hospitality . Naushon is its old Indian name . William Swain , Esq ., commonly known as “ the Governor , ” was the proprietor of it at the time when this song was written . Mr. John M.

     <l n="1">A HEALTH to dear woman ! She bids us untwine ,</l>
     <l n="2">From the cup it encircles , the fast-clinging vine ;</l>
     <l n="3">But her cheek in its crystal with pleasure will glow ,</l>
     <l n="4">And mirror its bloom in the bright wave below .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">A health to sweet woman ! The days are no more</l>
     <l n="6">When she watched for her lord till the revel was o'er ,</l>
     <l n="7">And smoothed the white pillow , and blushed when he came ,</l>
     <l n="8">As she pressed her cold lips on his forehead of flame .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">Alas for the loved one ! too spotless and fair</l>
     <l n="10">The joys of his banquet to chasten and share ;</l>
     <l n="11">Her eye lost its light that his goblet might shine ,</l>
     <l n="12">And the rose of her cheek was dissolved in his wine .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">Joy smiles in the fountain , health flows in the rills ,</l>
     <l n="14">As their ribbons of silver unwind from the hills ;</l>
     <l n="15">They breathe not the mist of the bacchanal 's dream ,</l>
     <l n="16">But the lilies of innocence float on their stream .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="17">Then a health and a welcome to woman once more !</l>
     <l n="18">She brings us a passport that laughs at our door ;</l>
     <l n="19">It is written on crimson ,— its letters are pearls ,—</l>
     <l n="20">It is countersigned Nature .— So , room for the Girls !</l>

    <head>A SENTIMENT</head>
     <l n="1">THE pledge of Friendship ! it is still divine ,</l>
     <l n="2">Though watery floods have quenched its burning wine ;</l>
     <l n="3">Whatever vase the sacred drops may hold ,</l>
     <l n="4">The gourd , the shell , the cup of beaten gold ,</l>
     <l n="5">Around its brim the hand of Nature throws</l>
     <l n="6">A garland sweeter than the banquet 's rose .</l>
     <l n="7">Bright are the blushes of the vine-wreathed bowl ,</l>
     <l n="8">Warm with the sunshine of Anacreon 's soul ,</l>
     <l n="9">But dearer memories gild the tasteless wave</l>
     <l n="10">That fainting Sidney perished as he gave .</l>
     <l n="11">‘ T is the heart 's current lends the cup its glow ,</l>
     <l n="12">Whate'er the fountain whence the draught may flow ,—</l>
     <l n="13">The diamond dew-drops sparkling through the sand ,</l>
     <l n="14">Scooped by the Arab in his sunburnt hand ,</l>
     <l n="15">Or the dark streamlet oozing from the snow ,</l>
     <l n="16">Where creep and crouch the shuddering Esquimaux ;</l>
     <l n="17">Ay , in the stream that , ere again we meet ,</l>
     <l n="18">Shall burst the pavement , glistening at our feet ,</l>
     <l n="19">And , stealing silent from its leafy hills ,</l>
     <l n="20">Thread all our alleys with its thousand rills ,—</l>
     <l n="21">In each pale draught if generous feeling blend ,</l>
     <l n="22">And o'er the goblet friend shall smile on friend ,</l>
     <l n="23">Even cold Cochituate every heart shall warm ,</l>
     <l n="24">And genial Nature still defy reform !</l>
