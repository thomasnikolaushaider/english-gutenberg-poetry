     </lg>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>ADVERTISEMENT TO THE FIRST EDITION .</p>
   <p>This poem contains the impressions of the writer upon events in Tuscany of which she was a witness . “ From a window , ” the critic may demur . She bows to the objection in the very title of her work . No continuous narrative nor exposition of political philosophy is attempted by her . It is a simple story of personal impressions , whose only value is in the intensity with which they were received , as proving her warm affection for a beautiful and unfortunate country , and the sincerity with which they are related , as indicating her own good faith and freedom from partisanship .</p>
   <p>Of the two parts of this poem , the first was written nearly three years ago , while the second resumes the actual situation of 1851 . The discrepancy between the two parts is a sufficient guarantee to the public of the truthfulness of the writer , who , though she certainly escaped the epidemic “ falling sickness ” of enthusiasm for Pio Nono , takes shame upon herself that she believed , like a woman , some royal oaths , and lost sight of the probable consequences of some obvious popular defects . If the discrepancy should be painful to the reader , let him understand that to the writer it has been more so . But such discrepancies we are called upon to accept at every hour by the conditions of our nature , implying the interval between aspiration and performance , between faith and disillusion , between hope and fact .</p>

      <l n="1">I heard last night a little child go singing</l>

      <l n="32">They called it Cybele , or Niobe ,</l>
      <l n="33">Or laid it corpse-like on a bier for such ,</l>
      <l n="34">Where all the world might drop for Italy</l>
      <l n="35">Those cadenced tears which burn not where they touch ,—</l>
      <l n="36">“ Juliet of nations , canst thou die as we ?</l>

      <l n="350">Oblivion of their wings ; the Child thereat</l>
      <l n="351">Stretching its hand like God . If any should ,</l>
      <l n="352">Because of some stiff draperies and loose joints ,</l>

      <l n="357">To ague and cold spasms for evermore .</l>
      <l n="358">A noble picture ! worthy of the shout</l>

      <l n="360">Its cherub-faces which the sun threw out</l>
      <l n="361">Until they stooped and entered the church door .</l>
      <l n="362">Yet rightly was young Giotto talked about ,</l>
      <l n="363">Whom Cimabue found among the sheep ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 8 ]</span></l>
      <l n="364">And knew , as gods know gods , and carried home</l>

      <l n="372">Or else his Virgin 's smile had never had</l>
      <l n="373">Such sweetness in ‘ t. All great men who foreknew</l>
      <l n="374">Their heirs in art , for art 's sake have been glad ,</l>

      <l n="377">Far more than of their triumphs , which were found</l>
      <l n="378">With some less vehement struggle of the will .</l>
      <l n="379">If old Margheritone trembled , swooned</l>

      <l n="381">Of other men 's achievements ( who achieved ,</l>
      <l n="382">By loving art beyond the master ) , he</l>
      <l n="383">Was old Margheritone , and conceived</l>
      <l n="384">Never , at first youth and most ecstasy ,</l>
      <l n="385">A Virgin like that dream of one , which heaved</l>
      <l n="386">The death-sigh from his heart . If wistfully</l>
      <l n="387">Margheritone sickened at the smell</l>
      <l n="388">Of Cimabue 's laurel , let him go !</l>
      <l n="389">For Cimabue stood up very well</l>
      <l n="390">In spite of Giotto 's , and Angelico</l>
      <l n="391">The artist-saint kept smiling in his cell</l>
      <l n="392">The smile with which he welcomed the sweet slow</l>
      <l n="393">Inbreak of angels ( whitening through the dim</l>
      <l n="394">That he might paint them ) , while the sudden sense</l>

      <l n="522">With passionate looks the gesture 's whirling off</l>
      <l n="523">A hurricane of leaves . Three hours did end</l>

      <l n="525">Rude men , unconscious of the tears that kept</l>
      <l n="526">Their beards moist , shouted ; some few laughed aloud ,</l>
      <l n="527">And none asked any why they laughed and wept :</l>
      <l n="528">Friends kissed each other 's cheeks , and foes long vowed</l>
      <l n="529">More warmly did it ; two-months ’ babies leapt</l>
      <l n="530">Right upward in their mother 's arms , whose black</l>

      <l n="541">Nor Right deny , and each in reverent awe</l>
      <l n="542">Honoured the other . And if , ne'ertheless ,</l>

      <l n="544">No charta , and the liberal Duke 's excess</l>

      <l n="546">In any special actual righteousness</l>
      <l n="547">Of what that day he granted , still the signs</l>

      <l n="550">And kings concede their people 's right to pray</l>
      <l n="551">Both in one sunshine . Griefs are not despairs ,</l>
      <l n="552">So uttered , nor can royal claims dismay</l>

      <l n="561">They too should govern as the people willed .</l>
      <l n="562">What a cry rose then ! some , who saw the best ,</l>

      <l n="567">Sufficient comprehension ,— mild and sad ,</l>
      <l n="568">And careful nobly ,— not with care that wraps</l>
      <l n="569">Self-loving hearts , to stifle and make mad ,</l>

   <p>POEMS BEFORE CONGRESS</p>
   <p>PREFACE .</p>
   <p>These poems were written under the pressure of the events they indicate , after a residence in Italy of so many years that the present triumph of great principles is heightened to the writer 's feelings by the disastrous issue of the last movement , witnessed from “ Casa Guidi Windows ” in 1849 . Yet , if the verses should appear to English readers too pungently rendered to admit of a patriotic respect to the English sense of things , I will not excuse myself on such grounds , nor on the ground of my attachment to the Italian people and my admiration of their heroic constancy and union . What I have written has simply been written because I love truth and justice quand meme ,— “ more than Plato ” and Plato 's country , more than Dante and Dante 's country , more even than Shakespeare and Shakespeare 's country .</p>
   <p>And if patriotism means the flattery of one 's nation in every case , then the patriot , take it as you please , is merely the courtier which I am not , though I have written “ Napoleon III . in Italy . ” It is time to limit the significance of certain terms , or to enlarge the significance of certain things . Nationality is excellent in its place ; and the instinct of self-love is the root of a man , which will develop into sacrificial virtues . But all the virtues are means and uses ; and , if we hinder their tendency to growth and expansion , we both destroy them as virtues , and degrade them to that rankest species of corruption reserved for the most noble organizations . For instance ,— non-intervention in the affairs of neighbouring states is a high political virtue ; but non-intervention does not mean , passing by on the other side when your neighbour falls among thieves ,— or Phariseeism would recover it from Christianity . Freedom itself is virtue , as well as privilege ; but freedom of the seas does not mean piracy , nor freedom of the land , brigandage ; nor freedom of the senate , freedom to cudgel a dissident member ; nor freedom of the press , freedom to calumniate and lie . So , if patriotism be a virtue indeed , it cannot mean an exclusive devotion to our country 's interests ,— for that is only another form of devotion to personal interests , family interests , or provincial interests , all of which , if not driven past themselves , are vulgar and immoral objects . Let us put away the Little Peddlingtonism unworthy of a great nation , and too prevalent among us . If the man who does not look beyond this natural life is of a somewhat narrow order , what must be the man who does not look beyond his own frontier or his own sea ?</p>
   <p>I confess that I dream of the day when an English statesman shall arise with a heart too large for England ; having courage in the face of his countrymen to assert of some suggested policy ,— “ This is good for your trade ; this is necessary for your domination : but it will vex a people hard by ; it will hurt a people farther off ; it will profit nothing to the general humanity : therefore , away with it !— it is not for you or for me . ” When a British minister dares speak so , and when a British public applauds him speaking , then shall the nation be glorious , and her praise , instead of exploding from within , from loud civic mouths , come to her from without , as all worthy praise must , from the alliances she has fostered and the populations she has saved .</p>
   <p>And poets who write of the events of that time shall not need to justify themselves in prefaces for ever so little jarring of the national sentiment imputable to their rhymes .</p>

     <l n="1">These Poems are given as they occur on a list drawn up last June . A</l>

   <p>There is hardly such direct warrant for publishing the Translations ; which were only intended , many years ago , to accompany and explain certain Engravings after ancient Gems , in the projected work of a friend , by whose kindness they are now recovered : but as two of the original series ( the “ Adonis ” of Bion and “ Song to the Rose ” from Achilles Tatius ) have subsequently appeared , it is presumed that the remainder may not improperly follow .</p>
   <p>A single recent version is added .</p>
