    <head>PREFACE</head>
    <p n="1">In publishing this poem , the Author feels that some apology is needed . It deals with matters of a kind not usually treated in modern verse , and which ask to be approached , if at all , with dignity and reverence . He trusts that he will not be found lacking on this essential point . Nevertheless , he cannot expect but that he may wound by his plain speaking the feelings of those among his readers who sincerely believe that Nineteenth Century Civilisation is synonymous with Christianity , and that the English Race , above all those in existence , has a special mission from Heaven to subdue and occupy the Earth . The self-complacency of the Author 's countrymen on this head is too deeply seated to be attacked without offence . He has not , however , shrunk from so attacking , and from insisting on the truth that the hypocrisy and all-acquiring greed of modern England is an atrocious spectacle — one which , if there be any justice in Heaven , must bring a curse from God , as it has surely already made the angels weep . The destruction of beauty in the name of science , the destruction of happiness in the name of progress , the destruction of reverence in the name of religion , these are the pharisaic crimes of all the white races ; but there is something in the Anglo-Saxon impiety crueller still : that it also destroys , as no other race does , for its mere vain-glorious pleasure . The Anglo-Saxon alone has in our day exterminated , root and branch , whole tribes of mankind . He alone has depopulated continents , species after species , of their wonderful animal life , and is still yearly destroying ; and this not merely to occupy the land , for it lies in large part empty , but for his insatiable lust of violent adventure , to make record bags and kill . That things are so is ample reason for the hardest words the Author can command .</p>
    <p n="2">To his fellow poets and poetic critics the Author too would say a word . He has chosen as the vehicle of his thought a metre to which in English they are unaccustomed , the six-foot Alexandrine couplet . For some reason which the Author has never understood , this , the classic metre in France , has stood in disrepute with us . Yet he ventures to think that , for rhetorical and dramatic purposes , it is infinitely preferable to our own heroic couplet , and preferable even , in any hands but the strongest , to our traditional blank verse . He believes , moreover , that if our skilled dramatists would make trial of it , it would , by its extreme flexibility and the natural break of its cesura , enable them to capture that shyest of all shy things — success in a rhymed modern play . At least , he trusts that they will give it their consideration , and not condemn him off-hand because , having a rhetorical subject to deal with , he has treated it rhetorically and in what he considers the best rhetoric form , though both rhetoric and Alexandrines are out of fashion .</p>
    <p n="3">Lastly , he has to discharge , in connection with his poem , a double debt of gratitude . The poem , unworthy as it is , is , by permission , dedicated to the first of living thinkers , Mr. Herbert Spencer . To his reasoned and life-long advocacy of the rights of the weak in Man 's higher evolution is due all that in the poem is intellectually worthiest , to this and to the inspiration of much personal encouragement and sympathy received by the Author at a moment of public excitement when it was onerous yet necessary for the Author to speak unpopular truths .</p>
    <p n="4">To Mr. Spencer 's great name the Author would add the name of that other senior of the ideal world , Mr. George Frederick Watts , the first of living painters , with whom , while the poem was in progress , it was his privilege to spend many emotional hours in high communings on Life and Death and the tragic Beauty of the world . He would thank him publicly here for the leave generously given him to add to the volume its chief ornament , the frontispiece , which is a reproduction of Mr. Watts ’ Angel of Pity weeping over the dead birds ’ wings .</p>
    <p n="5">To both these heroic workers in the cause of good the Author in gratitude inscribes himself their faithful servant , disciple , and friend .</p>

    <head>SATAN</head>
     <l n="1">To-day is the Lord 's “ day . ” Once more on His good pleasure</l>
     <l n="2">I , the Heresiarch , wait and pace these halls at leisure</l>
     <l n="3">Among the Orthodox , the unfallen Sons of God .</l>
     <l n="4">How sweet in truth Heaven is , its floors of sandal wood ,</l>
     <l n="5">Its old-world furniture , its linen long in press ,</l>
     <l n="6">Its incense , mummeries , flowers , its scent of holiness !</l>
     <l n="7">Each house has its own smell . The smell of Heaven to me</l>
     <l n="8">Intoxicates and haunts — and hurts . Who would not be</l>
     <l n="9">God 's liveried servant here , the slave of His behest ,</l>
     <l n="10">Rather than reign outside ? I like good things the best ,</l>
     <l n="11">Fair things , things innocent ; and gladly , if He willed ,</l>
     <l n="12">Would enter His Saints ’ kingdom — even as a little child ( laughs ) .</l>
     <l n="13">I have come to make my peace , to crave a full “ amaun , ”</l>
     <l n="14">Peace , pardon , reconcilement , truce to our daggers-drawn ,</l>
     <l n="15">Which have so long distraught the fair wise Universe ,</l>
     <l n="16">An end to my rebellion and the mortal curse</l>
     <l n="17">Of always evil-doing . He will mayhap agree</l>
     <l n="18">I was less wholly wrong about Humanity</l>
     <l n="19">The day I dared to warn His wisdom of that flaw .</l>
     <l n="20">It was at least the truth , the whole truth I foresaw</l>
     <l n="21">When he must needs create that simian “ in His own</l>
     <l n="22">Image and likeness . ” Faugh ! the unseemly carrion !</l>
     <l n="23">I claim a new revision and with proofs in hand ,</l>
     <l n="24">No Job now in my path to foil me and withstand .</l>
     <l n="25">Oh , I will serve Him well !</l>
     <l n="26">( Certain Angels approach ) . But who are these that come</l>
     <l n="27">With their grieved faces pale and eyes of martyrdom ?</l>
     <l n="28">Not our good Sons of God ? They stop , gesticulate ,</l>
     <l n="29">Argue apart , some weep ,— weep , here within Heaven 's gate !</l>
     <l n="30">Sob almost in God 's sight ! ay , real salt human tears ,</l>
     <l n="31">Such as no Spirit wept these thrice three thousand years .</l>
     <l n="32">The last shed were my own , that night of reprobation</l>
     <l n="33">When I unsheathed my sword and headed the lost nation .</l>
     <l n="34">Since then not one of them has spoken above his breath</l>
     <l n="35">Or whispered in these courts one word of life or death</l>
     <l n="36">Displeasing to the Lord . No Seraph of them all ,</l>
     <l n="37">Save I this day each year , has dared to cross Heaven 's hall</l>
     <l n="38">And give voice to ill news , an unwelcome truth to Him .</l>
     <l n="39">Not Michael 's self hath dared , prince of the Seraphim .</l>
     <l n="40">Yet all now wail aloud . What ails ye , brethren ? Speak !</l>
     <l n="41">Are ye too in rebellion ?</l>

     <l n="2">From which to choose Thy plan . This plan , no less than those ,</l>
     <l n="3">Was noble in conception , when its vision rose</l>
     <l n="4">Before Thee in Thy dreams . Thou deemedst to endow</l>
     <l n="5">Time with a great new wonder , wonderful as Thou ,</l>
     <l n="6">Matter made sensitive , informed with Life , with Soul .</l>
     <l n="7">It grieved Thee the Stars knew not . Thou couldst not cajole</l>
     <l n="8">Their music into tears , their beauty to full praise .</l>
     <l n="9">Thou askedst one made conscious of Thy works and ways ,</l>
     <l n="10">One dowered with sense and passion , which should feel and move</l>
     <l n="11">And weep with Thee and laugh , one that alas , should love .</l>
     <l n="12">Thus didst thou mould the Earth . We Spirits , wondering , eyed</l>
     <l n="13">Thy new-born fleshly things , Thy Matter deified .</l>
     <l n="14">We saw the sea take life , its myriad forms all fair .</l>
     <l n="15">We saw the creeping things , the dragons of the air ,</l>
     <l n="16">The birds , the four-foot beasts , all beautiful , all strong ,</l>
     <l n="17">All brimming o'er with joyaunce , new green woods among ,</l>
     <l n="18">Twice glorious in their lives . And we , who were but spirit ,</l>

     <l n="20">Their feet , their eyes , their wings , their physical desires ,</l>
     <l n="21">The anger of their voices , the fierce sexual fires</l>

     <l n="23">Their power to act , to feel , all that corporeal part</l>
     <l n="24">Which is the truth of love and giveth the breathing thing</l>
     <l n="25">The wonder of its beauty incarnate in Spring .</l>

     <l n="30">When at her dugs he mumbleth . Nay , the milk she giveth</l>

     <l n="13">It was not these we feared . We bowed to Thy command ,</l>

     <l n="15">Upon the weakling steer , the falcon bend her wing</l>
     <l n="16">To reive the laggard fowl , the monster of the deep</l>
     <l n="17">Devour and be devoured . He who hath sown shall reap .</l>
     <l n="18">And we beheld the Earth by that mute law controlled ,</l>
     <l n="19">Grow ever young and new , Time 's necklace of pure gold</l>
     <l n="20">Set on Creation 's neck . We gazed , and we applauded</l>
     <l n="21">The splendour of Thy might , Thy incarnated Godhead .</l>
     <l n="22">And yet — Lord God , forgive — Nay , hear me . Thou wert not</l>
     <l n="23">Content with this fair world in its first glorious thought .</l>
     <l n="24">Thou needs must make thee Man . Ah , there Thy wisdom strayed .</l>
     <l n="25">Thou wantedst one to know Thee , no mere servile jade ,</l>
     <l n="26">But a brave upright form to walk the Earth and be</l>
     <l n="27">Thy lieutenant with all and teach integrity ,</l>
     <l n="28">One to aspire , adorn , to stand the roof and crown</l>

     <l n="31">One thou shouldst call Thy rose of all Time 's blossomings .</l>
     <l n="32">And thou evolvedst Man !— There were a thousand forms ,</l>
     <l n="33">All glorious , all sublime , the riders of Thy storms ,</l>
     <l n="34">The battlers of Thy seas , the four-foot Lords of Earth ,</l>
     <l n="35">From which to choose Thy stem and get Thee a new birth .</l>
     <l n="36">There were forms painted , proud , bright birds with plumes of heaven</l>
     <l n="37">And songs more sweet than angels ’ heard on the hills at even ,</l>
     <l n="38">Frail flashing butterflies , free fishes of such hue</l>
     <l n="39">As rainbows hardly have , sleek serpents which renew</l>
     <l n="40">Their glittering coats like gems , grave brindled-hided kine ,</l>
     <l n="41">Large-hearted elephants , the horse how near divine ,</l>
     <l n="42">The whale , the mastodon , the mighty Behemoth ,</l>
     <l n="43">Leviathan 's self awake and glorious in his wrath .</l>
     <l n="44">All these thou hadst for choice , competitors with Thee</l>
     <l n="45">For Thy new gift and prize , Thy co-divinity .</l>
     <l n="46">Yet didst Thou choose , Lord God , the one comedian shape</l>
     <l n="47">In Thy Creation 's range , the lewd bare-buttocked ape ,</l>
     <l n="48">And calledst him , in scorn of all that brave parade ,</l>

     <l n="50">Where , Lord , was then Thy wisdom ? We , who watched Thee , saw</l>

    <head>SATAN</head>
     <l n="1">Ah , Lord , wilt Thou believe me ? That was a mighty dream ,</l>
     <l n="2">Sublime , of a world won by Thy Son 's stratagem</l>
     <l n="3">Of being himself a Man — the rueful outcast thing !</l>
     <l n="4">And of all men a Jew ! for poor Earth 's ransoming .</l>
     <l n="5">Thrice glorious inspiration ! Who but He had dared</l>
     <l n="6">Come naked , as He came , of all His kingship bared ,</l>
     <l n="7">Not one of us to serve Him , neither praised nor proud</l>
     <l n="8">But just as the least are , the last ones of the crowd .</l>
     <l n="9">He had not Man 's fierce eye . No beast fell back abashed</l>
     <l n="10">To meet Him in the woods , as though a flame had flashed .</l>
     <l n="11">He lay down with the foxes . The quails went and came</l>
     <l n="12">Between His feet asleep . They did not fear His blame .</l>
     <l n="13">He had not Man 's hard heart . He had not Man 's false hand .</l>
     <l n="14">His gesture was as theirs . Their wit could understand</l>
     <l n="15">He was their fellow flesh . To Him so near to God</l>
     <l n="16">What difference lay ‘ twixt Man and the least herb He trod ?</l>
     <l n="17">He came to save them all , to win all to His peace .</l>
     <l n="18">What cared He for Man , Jew , more than the least of these ?</l>
     <l n="19">And yet He loved His kind , the sick at heart , the poor ,</l>
     <l n="20">The impotent of will , those who from wrong forbore ,</l>
     <l n="21">Those without arms to strike , the lost of Israel .</l>
     <l n="22">Of these He made His kingdom — as it pleased Him well —</l>
     <l n="23">Kingdom without a king . His thought was to bring back</l>
     <l n="24">Earth to its earlier way , ere Man had left the track ,</l>
     <l n="25">And stay his rage to slay . “ Take ye no thought , ” said He ,</l>
     <l n="26">“ Of what the day may bring . Be as the lilies be .</l>
     <l n="27">“ They toil not , nor do spin , and yet are clothed withal .</l>
     <l n="28">“ Choose ye the lowest place . Be guileless of all gall .</l>
     <l n="29">“ If one shall smite you , smile . If one shall rob , give more .</l>

     <l n="32">“ Only the pure in heart God 's kingdom shall inherit . ”</l>
     <l n="33">On this fair base of love Thy Son built up His creed ,</l>
     <l n="34">Thinking to save the world . And Man , who owned no need</l>
     <l n="35">Of any saving , slew Him .</l>

     <l n="1">A romance , Lord . Hear</l>
     <l n="2">The word of one Thy wanderer , sphere and hemisphere ,</l>
     <l n="3">For ever on Thy Earth , who shepherding Thy seas</l>
     <l n="4">No less than Thy green valleys hath nor rest nor peace ,</l>
     <l n="5">But he must learn the way of all who in them dwell ;</l>
     <l n="6">To whom there is no secret , naught untold , no hell</l>
     <l n="7">Where any sin may hide but he hath wormed it out</l>
     <l n="8">From silence to confession till his ears grew hot ;</l>
     <l n="9">Who knoweth the race of Man as his own flesh ; whose eye</l>
     <l n="10">Is cruel to evasion and the lips that lie ,</l>
     <l n="11">And who would tell Thee all , all , all to the last act</l>
     <l n="12">Of tragic fooling proved which seals Man 's counterpact .</l>
     <l n="13">— What was the true tale , think Thee , of Thy Son that died ?</l>
     <l n="14">What of the souls that knew Him , Him the crucified ,</l>
     <l n="15">After their Lord was gone ? They waited for Him long ,</l>
     <l n="16">The sick He had made whole , the wronged consoled of wrong ,</l>
     <l n="17">The women He had loved , the fisher folk whose ears</l>
     <l n="18">Had drunk in His word 's wisdom those three wondrous years ,</l>
     <l n="19">And deemed Him prophet , prince , His kingdom yet to come ,</l>
     <l n="20">Nay from the grave new-risen and had been seen of some .</l>
     <l n="21">What did they teach ? Awhile , they told His law of peace ,</l>
     <l n="22">His rule of unresistance and sweet guilelessness ,</l>
     <l n="23">His truce with mother Earth , His abstinence from toil ,</l>
     <l n="24">His love of the least life that wanton hands despoil ,</l>
     <l n="25">The glory of His tears , His watching , fasting , prayer ,</l>
     <l n="26">The patience of His death , His last word of despair .</l>
     <l n="27">And as He lived they lived — awhile — expectant still</l>
     <l n="28">Of His return in power to balance the Earth 's ill .</l>
     <l n="29">They would not deem Him dead . But , when He came not , lo ,</l>
     <l n="30">Their reason went astray . Poor souls , they loved Him so ,</l>
     <l n="31">They had such grief for Him , their one true God in Man</l>
     <l n="32">Revealed to their sad eyes in all a World grown wan ,</l>
     <l n="33">That they must build a creed , a refuge from their fears</l>
     <l n="34">In His remembered words and so assuage their tears .</l>
     <l n="35">His kingdom ? It was what ? Not all a dream ? Forbid</l>
     <l n="36">That fault , that failure , Heaven , for such were death indeed .</l>
     <l n="37">His promises of peace , goodwill on earth to men ,</l>
     <l n="38">Which needed a fulfilment , lest faith fail ? How then</l>
     <l n="39">Since no fulfilment came , since He had left them lone</l>
     <l n="40">In face of the world 's wolves , for bread had given a stone ?</l>
     <l n="41">How reconcile His word with that which was their life ,</l>
     <l n="42">Man 's hatred and God 's silence in a world of strife ?</l>
     <l n="43">Was there no path , no way ? Nay , none on this sad Earth</l>
     <l n="44">Save with their Lord to suffer and account it mirth .</l>
     <l n="45">And so awhile they grieved . Then rose a subtlety —</l>
     <l n="46">Lord God , Thou knowest not wholly how men crave to lie</l>
     <l n="47">In face of a hard truth too grievous to their pride —</l>
     <l n="48">To these poor fisher folk , thus of their Lord denied ,</l>
     <l n="49">Came a new blinding vision . They had seen Thy Son</l>
     <l n="50">How often after death , no ghost , no carrion ,</l>
     <l n="51">But a plain man alive , who moved among them slow ,</l>
     <l n="52">And showed His feet and hands , the thorn prints on His brow ,</l>
     <l n="53">The spear wound in His side . He had come to comfort them ,</l>
     <l n="54">Confirm them in the faith , by His love 's stratagem .</l>
     <l n="55">How if this thing were real : If this , that proved Him God ,</l>
     <l n="56">Proved also themselves spirits , not mere flesh and blood</l>
     <l n="57">One with the beasts that perish , but immortal souls ,</l>
     <l n="58">Even as we angels are who fill Heaven 's muster rolls</l>
     <l n="59">And so shall live for aye ? “ Here , ” argued they , “ it stands</l>
     <l n="60">“ The kingdom of His Heaven , a house not made with hands ,</l>
     <l n="61">“ Wherein we too new-born , but in no earthly case ,</l>
     <l n="62">“ Shall enter after death . ” On this fair fragile base</l>
     <l n="63">Their sorrow built its nest . It gave a hope to men</l>
     <l n="64">And pandered to their pride . And lo the world 's disdain</l>
     <l n="65">Was changed to acclamation . Kings and emperors kneeled</l>
     <l n="66">Before the Crucified , a living God revealed ,</l>
     <l n="67">Who made them heirs with Him of His own glory . Mark</l>
     <l n="68">The ennobling phrase and title . No base Noah 's ark</l>
     <l n="69">Man 's fount of honour now , but God 's eternal choice</l>
     <l n="70">Made of His human race , predestined to His joys</l>
     <l n="71">From the first dawn of time ,— the very Universe</l>
     <l n="72">Resolved to a mere potsherd , shattered to rehearse</l>
     <l n="73">The splendour of Man 's advent , the one act and end</l>
     <l n="74">To which Creation moved , and where even we must tend ,</l>
     <l n="75">The spirit hosts of Heaven — Stark mad insolence !</l>
     <l n="76">Rank blasphemy proclaimed in Rome 's halls and Byzance ,</l>
     <l n="77">Through all the Imperial lands , as though , forsooth , Thou , Lord ,</l>
     <l n="78">Couldst , even if Thou wouldst , raise this fantastic horde</l>
     <l n="79">Of bodies to Thy glory , shapes dispersed and gone</l>
     <l n="80">As lightly as Time 's wracks swept to oblivion !</l>
     <l n="81">Yet all believed this creed . Space , straightway grown too strait ,</l>
     <l n="82">Shrank from these Christened kings , who held Earth reprobate</l>
     <l n="83">Save for their own high calling . Heaven had become their throne ,</l>
     <l n="84">A fief for their new pride , in which they reigned alone ,</l>
     <l n="85">In virtue of their faith , above Time 's humbler show ,</l>
     <l n="86">And Earth became their footstool . All were masters now</l>
     <l n="87">Of the brute beasts despised who had no souls to save ,</l>
     <l n="88">And lords too of the heathen doomed beyond the grave .</l>
     <l n="89">God 's kingdom had begun . It compassed all the lands</l>
     <l n="90">And trafficked wealth and power . It issued its commands ,</l>
     <l n="91">And in default it slew in Thy high holy name ,</l>
     <l n="92">Thine the all merciful ! Alas for the world 's shame !</l>
     <l n="93">Alas for the world 's reason , for Thy Son 's sane creed</l>
     <l n="94">Of doing only good each day to its own need ,</l>
     <l n="95">Of being as the least of these in wise humility !</l>
     <l n="96">Behold our Christian Saints , too proud to live or die</l>
     <l n="97">As all flesh dies and lives , their emperors and kings</l>
     <l n="98">Clothed in the robes of life as with an eagle 's wings ,</l>
     <l n="99">Their Popes dispensing power , their priests absolving sin .</l>
     <l n="100">Nay . They have made a hell their damned shall dwell within ,</l>
     <l n="101">With me for their gaolmaster in a world to come</l>
     <l n="102">Of which they hold the keys ! God 's curse on Christendom !</l>

     <l n="80">And with the rest her faiths bearing the Christian name .</l>
     <l n="81">From this wild bitter root of violent lust and greed</l>
     <l n="82">New Christendom upsprang , a pagan blood-stained creed ,</l>
     <l n="83">Pagan in spite of Christ , for the old gods cast down</l>
     <l n="84">Still ruled it in men 's hearts and lured them to renown ,</l>
     <l n="85">Ay in Thy name , Lord God , by glamour of the sword ,</l>
     <l n="86">And for Thy dead Son 's sake , as in the days abhorred .</l>
     <l n="87">Like bulls they strove , they slew , like wolves they seized the prey ,</l>
     <l n="88">The hungriest strongest first , and who should say them nay .</l>
     <l n="89">After the Goth the Gaul , after the Gaul the Dane ,</l>
     <l n="90">Kings in descent from Thor , peace sued to them in vain .</l>
     <l n="91">Thou knowest , Lord God , their story . It is writ in blood ,</l>
     <l n="92">The blood of beast and man , by their brute hands subdued ,</l>
     <l n="93">Down to the latest born , the hungriest of the pack ,</l>
     <l n="94">The master wolf of all men call the Sassenach ,</l>
     <l n="95">The Anglo-Norman dog , who goeth by land and sea</l>
     <l n="96">As his forefathers went in chartered piracy ,</l>
     <l n="97">Death , fire in his right hand .</l>

     <l n="1">They fear his tongue ,</l>
     <l n="2">Unscrupulous to speak , the right he hath in wrong ,</l>
     <l n="3">The wrong he hath in right . They doubt he hath Thine ear ,</l>
     <l n="4">Lord of the Universe . They are excused of fear .</l>
     <l n="5">They see his long success , his victory over good ,</l>
     <l n="6">They count the nations lost which were of kindlier blood</l>
     <l n="7">But could not stand before him , his great subtlety ,</l>
     <l n="8">His skill in the arts , the crafts . They mark the powers that be</l>

     <l n="23">And they , who think to please , retail it as their own .</l>
     <l n="24">What say they of him , Lord ? That he hath one God alone ,</l>
     <l n="25">Is not as the lewd nations , keepeth Thy Sabbath holy ,</l>
     <l n="26">Nor Thy name vainly taketh in the ways of folly ,</l>

     <l n="56">In his account with time , and add strength to his hand ,</l>
     <l n="57">Serving his best advantage in the enlarged domain</l>
     <l n="58">Of his Man 's selfishness , which works for the World 's bane</l>
     <l n="59">More surely than his vices . He hath outlived the day</l>
     <l n="60">Of the old single graspings , where each went his way</l>

     <l n="86">Thy all-deciding arm in the world 's policies .</l>
     <l n="87">They ignore Thee on the Earth . They grant Thee , as their “ God , ”</l>

     <l n="136">This slave , being what he is , should ape divinity ,</l>
     <l n="137">The poorest saddest drudge , the least joy-lifted heart</l>

     <l n="143">To glorify Thy name ! Not selfishly , forsooth ,</l>

     <l n="148">On his white Saxon back for his white conscience sake .</l>
     <l n="149">Huge impudent imposture !— Lord , there were fair lands</l>
     <l n="150">Once on Thy Earth , brave hills , bright isles , sweet coral strands ,</l>
     <l n="151">Noble savannahs , plains of limitless waving green ,</l>
     <l n="152">Lakes girt with giant forests , continents unseen ,</l>
     <l n="153">Unknown by these white thieves , where men lived in the way</l>
     <l n="154">Of Thy good natural law with Thy free beasts at play</l>
     <l n="155">And partners with Thy birds , men who nor toiled nor span ,</l>
     <l n="156">Nor sowed , nor reaped , nor delved for the red curse of Man ,</l>
     <l n="157">The gold that kills the soul , who knew nought of the fire</l>

     <l n="159">More deadly still concealed in his fire drink of death ;</l>
     <l n="160">Who went unclothed , unshamed , for garment a flower wreath ;</l>
     <l n="161">Whose women lived unsold and loved their natural kin ,</l>
     <l n="162">Nor gave aught to the stranger in the wage of sin ;</l>
     <l n="163">Who blessed Thee for their babes and through the woods , like Eve ,</l>
     <l n="164">Wandered in happy laughter , glorying to conceive .</l>
     <l n="165">Yea , Lord , and there were others ,— shut communities</l>
     <l n="166">Of souls still on Thy path and strange to the new lies ,</l>
     <l n="167">Yet , not as these were , wild , but held in discipline</l>

     <l n="22">In moody bestial wrath , unclassed among Earth 's ills —</l>
     <l n="23">Each one of them is doomed . From the deep Central Seas</l>
     <l n="24">To the white Poles , Man ruleth pitiless Lord of these ,</l>
     <l n="25">And daily he destroyeth . The great whales he driveth</l>
     <l n="26">Beneath the northern ice , and quarter none he giveth ,</l>
     <l n="27">Who perish there of wounds in their huge agony .</l>
     <l n="28">He presseth the white bear on the white frozen sea</l>
     <l n="29">And slaughtereth for his pastime . The wise amorous seal</l>

     <l n="31">But cannot turn his rage , alive he mangleth them ,</l>
     <l n="32">Leaveth in breathing heaps , outrooted branch and stem .</l>
     <l n="33">In every land he slayeth . He hath new engines made</l>
     <l n="34">Which no life may withstand , nor in the forest shade</l>
     <l n="35">Nor in the sunlit plain , which wound all from afar ,</l>

     <l n="41">Thy antelopes in troops , the zebras of Thy plain ?</l>

     <l n="45">No thorn might pierce , no sting , no violent tooth assail ,</l>
     <l n="46">The tusks which were their levers , the lithe trunk their flail .</l>
     <l n="47">Thou strengthenedst their deep brain . Thou madest them wise to know</l>

     <l n="60">Their latest fiendliest spoil from Thy fair tropic lands ,</l>
     <l n="61">The birds of all the Earth unwinged to deck the heads</l>

     <l n="67">Such opalescent pearls as only in Thy skies</l>
     <l n="68">The lunar bow revealeth to night 's sleep-tired eyes .</l>

     <l n="70">Lord of Compassion , Thou who meetest means to ends ,</l>
     <l n="71">Nor madest Thy world fair for less than Thine own fame ,</l>
     <l n="72">Behold Thy birds of joy lost , tortured , put to shame</l>
     <l n="73">For these vile strumpets ’ whim . Arise , or cease to be</l>
