    <head>TO THE PUBLIC .</head>
    <head>We received so many kind assurances from friends in this neighborhood and from gentlemen at a distance who had taken an interest in our first little work , that they induce us to issue this more comprehensive volume containing about one hundred new pieces . We have written a number of dairy odes recently ; these and our patriotic songs composed during the past year we trust will make the work more interesting . We publish a few short pieces from many letters and poems we received from friends . We hope the public will peruse the poems in a friendly spirit , as a kind feeling towards all of the nationalities forming this young and vigorous Dominion has prompted us to publish these selections from our poetic works .</head>

   <p>I wish to express to you my great pleasure in looking over your musings on the Banks of Canadian Thames . It seemed to transport my memory across the chasm of twenty-five years and to call up the scenes , associations and joys of boyhood 's happy hour . Literary work of this kind must add greatly to your pleasure and happiness as it certainly does to that of your friends .</p>
   <p>The Editor of the Toronto Globe , after reviewing a number of other books pronounced our little volume to be the gem of the table .</p>
   <p>Col. Denison , Toronto 's police magistrate , “ found many most interesting pieces on Canadian subjects in the volume . ”</p>

     <l n="10">Forever in the old country ,</l>
     <l n="11">His forefathers had tilled the ground</l>
     <l n="12">And never one had saved a pound .</l>

     <l n="15">Their one luxury around their door</l>
     <l n="16">A few choice flowers their garden bore ,</l>

     <l n="54">Where'er she was , that spot was blessed ,</l>
     <l n="55">And though they did not have stove then ,</l>
     <l n="56">Neither did they own an oven ;</l>
     <l n="57">She filled large pot with well knead dough</l>
     <l n="58">And baked fine bread ‘ mong embers glow ;</l>
     <l n="59">He each winter the forest trees</l>
     <l n="60">Did quickly hew them down with ease ,</l>
     <l n="61">For he to work had a desire</l>
     <l n="62">And the skill did soon acquire ,</l>
     <l n="63">But round great giants hewed a ring</l>
     <l n="64">Then storms would soon them prostrate bring ,</l>
     <l n="65">For many a time the furious breeze</l>
     <l n="66">Would quick o'erthrow the girdled trees ,</l>
     <l n="67">And sometimes they would kill the cows</l>
     <l n="68">When they did feed on grass or browse ,</l>
     <l n="69">But after reckoning damage all</l>
     <l n="70">A benefit was each windfall ;</l>
     <l n="71">Though good fortune now he sees</l>
     <l n="72">Might have been got from Walnut trees ;</l>
     <l n="73">But trees were foes in his hurry ,</l>
     <l n="74">All were slain , both oak and cherry ,</l>
     <l n="75">And to this day he doth incline</l>
     <l n="76">To mourn o'er slaughter of the pine ,</l>
     <l n="77">And reflects how he did o'erwhelm</l>
     <l n="78">Many a maple , beech and elm ;</l>
     <l n="79">And each summer day did toil</l>
     <l n="80">With his steers drawing logs in pile ;</l>
     <l n="81">These giants of the forest dead ,</l>
     <l n="82">Fire did reduce to an ash bed ,</l>
     <l n="83">And soon potatoes , wheat and corn ,</l>
     <l n="84">They did the rugged stumps adorn ,</l>
     <l n="85">And Jane did help him with the hoe ,</l>
     <l n="86">And well she did keep her row :</l>
     <l n="87">No organs then they had to play ,</l>
     <l n="88">But she could work and sing all day ;</l>
     <l n="89">In spring he did live maples tap</l>
     <l n="90">To draw from them the luscious sap ,</l>
     <l n="91">He gathered it in big log trough ,</l>
     <l n="92">Then boiled it down and sugared off ,</l>
     <l n="93">Enough the household for to cheer ,</l>
     <l n="94">With all its sweets for the whole year ,</l>
     <l n="95">And no such thing those times were seen</l>
     <l n="96">As the swift raising stump machine ,</l>
     <l n="97">And where main road was low and damp</l>
     <l n="98">With logs he built a road through swamp ,</l>
     <l n="99">But a smooth ride could not enjoy</l>
     <l n="100">While it was naught but corduroy ,</l>
     <l n="101">Each year added earth and gravel ,</l>
     <l n="102">Now smoothly o'er they can travel ,</l>
     <l n="103">For it doth make an excellent road</l>
     <l n="104">For John and Jane to go abroad ,</l>
     <l n="105">And it is now a great highway</l>
     <l n="106">Where hundreds travel every day .</l>
     <l n="107">There were no roads in early days</l>
     <l n="108">But bridle path , their guide the blaze ,</l>
     <l n="109">And mills and marts so far away ,</l>
     <l n="110">They never could return same day ;</l>
     <l n="111">Log school house served as church for all ,</l>
     <l n="112">Of various creeds , and for town hall .</l>
     <l n="113">These scenes to youth do now seem strange</l>
     <l n="114">So wondrous quick hath been the change ,</l>
     <l n="115">O'er paths where oxen only trod ,</l>
     <l n="116">Cows quickly speed o'er the railroad ,</l>
     <l n="117">And every way both up and down</l>
     <l n="118">There has sprung up a thriving town .</l>
     <l n="119">No more he fights with forest trees ,</l>
     <l n="120">But both enjoy their wealth and ease ,</l>
     <l n="121">Long since the old folks both are gone</l>
     <l n="122">And left the whole to Jane and John ;</l>
     <l n="123">The log house now has passed away</l>
     <l n="124">With all its chinks filled in with clay ,</l>
     <l n="125">And in its place fine house of stone</l>
     <l n="126">With lawn where choice shrubs are grown .</l>
     <l n="127">With sons and daughters they are blest ,</l>
     <l n="128">The young men say they 'll move Northwest ;</l>
     <l n="129">This gives their mother some alarm ,</l>
     <l n="130">She wants them still on the home farm ,</l>
     <l n="131">But father will not have them tarry</l>
     <l n="132">They can plow so quick on prairie ,</l>
     <l n="133">And they find coal makes a good fire ,</l>
     <l n="134">And build their fences of barbed wire</l>
     <l n="135">They would not be forever gone</l>
     <l n="136">As they could talk by telephone .</l>

    <head>LAMENT OF THE MAPLE TREE .</head>
    <head>A VISION .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ We had a dream which was not all a dream . ” — Byron .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="2">I laid me down one day in June ,</l>
     <l n="3">It was late long afternoon ,</l>
     <l n="4">A very sultry summer 's eve ,</l>
     <l n="5">Such times the senses oft deceive ,</l>
     <l n="6">The place was ‘ neath a maple tree ,</l>
     <l n="7">Soon from all cares and troubles free ,</l>
     <l n="8">By a gentle , kindly slumber ,</l>
     <l n="9">No more our sorrows we could number ,</l>
     <l n="10">But we heard a plaintive wail</l>
     <l n="11">Such as we find in fairy tale ,</l>
     <l n="12">It was the genius of the tree</l>
     <l n="13">Who in sad guise appeared to me ,</l>
     <l n="14">And then she sadly did give vent</l>
     <l n="15">Unto this awful grave lament :</l>
     <l n="16">Though I am gay in month of June ,</l>
     <l n="17">All decked in green , yet very soon ,</l>
     <l n="18">Alas my beauty will be faded</l>
     <l n="19">And my charms be all degraded ,</l>
     <l n="20">For is my time of glory brief ,</l>
     <l n="21">So often flattered is my leaf .</l>
     <l n="22">In Canada so broad and free</l>
     <l n="23">All poets sing of the maple tree ,</l>
     <l n="24">High I stand in their opinion ,</l>
     <l n="25">Emblem of the New Dominion ,</l>
     <l n="26">The reason I do them upbraid</l>
     <l n="27">Some never slept beneath my shade ,</l>
     <l n="28">And yet they take the liberty</l>
     <l n="29">To chant about the maple tree ,</l>
     <l n="30">They dare to poetise my leaf ,</l>
     <l n="31">This is the source of all my grief ,</l>
     <l n="32">I think their praises all so rude</l>
     <l n="33">And as but base ingratitude ,</l>
     <l n="34">So often hackneyed is my name</l>
     <l n="35">That every fall I burn with shame ,</l>
     <l n="36">Like maiden 's cheek which blushes red</l>
     <l n="37">When vain rash youth asks her to wed ,</l>
     <l n="38">Then do these foolish ones descry</l>
     <l n="39">In me fresh beauty and they sigh ,</l>
     <l n="40">And then renew their songs of praise .</l>
     <l n="41">But unto me how sad their lays ,</l>
     <l n="42">For then I know my days are brief ,</l>
     <l n="43">‘ Tis hectic flush upon my leaf ;</l>
     <l n="44">True poets then should mournful sing</l>
     <l n="45">When the destroyer 's on the wing ,</l>
     <l n="46">For then I know my leaves of gold</l>
     <l n="47">Will all soon mingle with the mould ,</l>
     <l n="48">No one does ever think to praise</l>
     <l n="49">The fell destroyer when he slays ,</l>
     <l n="50">None rejoice in the flushed cheek</l>
     <l n="51">When the poor girl is low and weak ,</l>
     <l n="52">Perhaps they 'll say and it is true</l>
     <l n="53">In spring my glories I 'll renew ,</l>
     <l n="54">But ‘ tis poor comfort after all</l>
     <l n="55">To lose my offspring every fall ,</l>
     <l n="56">Small consolation to mother</l>
     <l n="57">To tell her that soon another</l>
     <l n="58">Will replace her fond darling boy</l>
     <l n="59">Who has been source of all her joy ,</l>
     <l n="60">But you know all about my wood</l>
     <l n="61">You know that it is strong and good ,</l>
     <l n="62">And I have full many a curl</l>
     <l n="63">And pleasing eye and charming nurl ,</l>
     <l n="64">Some love me as fond nature grained</l>
     <l n="65">And some prefer my beauty stained ,</l>
     <l n="66">But my dear friend I hope that you</l>
     <l n="67">My varied shades love pure and true ,</l>
     <l n="68">For of the woods you know the staple</l>
     <l n="69">Stoutest and best is good maple ,</l>
     <l n="70">The youth my sugar eat with glee ,</l>
     <l n="71">And old maids love me in their tea ,</l>
     <l n="72">In me do various uses meet</l>
     <l n="73">In summer shade , in winter heat ,</l>
     <l n="74">For I do make a glorious blaze</l>
     <l n="75">All worthy of the poet 's lays ,</l>
     <l n="76">But to their praises I 'll be deaf</l>
     <l n="77">If more they harp about my leaf .</l>
     <l n="78">They call me gay when I am sober</l>
     <l n="79">To me ‘ tis gloomy month October ,</l>
     <l n="80">But saints on earth when they die</l>
     <l n="81">Hope for true bliss beyond the sky ,</l>
     <l n="82">So winter does bring no alarms</l>
     <l n="83">Though it strip bare my trunk and arms ,</l>
     <l n="84">For now I know that time will bring</l>
     <l n="85">More glorious foliage in the spring ,</l>
     <l n="86">Then all nature will rejoice</l>
     <l n="87">Triumphing with glorious voice ,</l>

    <head>CANADA OUR HOME , 1883 .</head>
     <l n="1">The following response to Canada our home was given at a banquet of the</l>
     <l n="2">Caledonian Society , Ingersoll :</l>
   </lg>
   <p>In responding to the sentiment Canada our home perhaps it would be appropriate to point out the prominent and distinguishing characteristics between the land of our nativity and the land of our adoption . In this Canada of ours we have no bonny blooming heath , no banks and braes covered o'er with daisies and gowans , no fragrant hedges showering down white spray in the May time , no whin and broom prodigal in their gaiety of yellow flowers , no hills nor glens where fairies gambol in pleasant and harmless sport , no grand ruins of ancient cathedrals and castles , no feathered songsters like the mavis and blackbird .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Full oft we did enraptured hark</l>
     <l n="2">To heavenly song of the skylark .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>But Canada is a young giant in its infancy with the noblest chain of lakes in the world on its frontier , and the most magnificent river the St. Lawrence . This land also possesses the largest fertile wilderness on the globe , but it is one which will ere many years have passed away , blossom like a garden , and where naught but grass and flowers now grow in wild luxuriance . Soon the husbandman will plow and sow and reap a rich reward in yellow golden grain . Domestic cattle quiet will graze where now the Buffalos roam and in spots now covered o'er with Indian wigwams , where white men never trod cities will occupy their sites with busy trade and millions flock from eastern lands to take possession of the great Northwest . Then Winnipeg perchance may be the capital of the Dominion . In the day foretold when this indeed shall be the “ Greater Britain ” with Ontario 's towns for workshops for this vast prairie land .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Then poets will arise and high their lays will soar ,</l>
     <l n="2">Worthy of the muse of a Burns or a Moore ,</l>
     <l n="3">A Shakespeare and a Milton , the great and the wise ,</l>
     <l n="4">Will sing of the glories of our northern skies ,</l>
     <l n="5">Of its lakes and rivers and its mountains grand ,</l>
     <l n="6">Of its fertile plains and great prairie land ,</l>
     <l n="7">A fit theme for song this empire gigantic ,</l>
     <l n="8">Whose arms stretch from Pacific to Atlantic .</l>

    <head>Robert F. Gourley was a graduate of St. Andrew 's University , Scotland . He was the first to agitate for popular rights in Canada . He was banished from the country and while crossing the Niagara River he asked for a brush to wipe Canadian dust from his feet . He became a champion of popular rights in England and he whipped Lord Brougham in the lobby of the House of Commons , for which breach of privilege he was sentenced by the House . Mr. Gourley owned several farms in Oxford , Ontario , and sought to represent South Oxford in 1858 , but Dr. Connor , an uncle of Hon . E.

   <p>The valley of the Thames , we presume , includes Stratford on the north and Woodstock and Ingersoll on the south . The Avon , on whose banks Stratford is located , joins the Thames near St. Marys . The middle branch flows through Embro and Thamesford . The south and middle branches unite and flow through Dorchester and Westminster and blend with the northern branch at London , where it deviates to Elgin in the south .</p>

   <p>DAIRY AND CHEESE ODES .</p>
   <p>As cheese making first began in this county and it has already become the chief industry of many counties , it is no insignificant theme . About the middle of this century Canada was a great importer of cheese , and now cheese is the principal article of export from the Province of Ontario , and this Province will soon export no less than ten millions of dollars worth of cheese per annum . Mr. Ranney was doing a thriving business in the dairy line , manufacturing cheese after the century was half gone on the dairy plan from the products of his own cows , and one decade later Mr. Farrington introduced the factory system . Both of these gentlemen have departed this life but Canada is enjoying the fruits of their labors , and about eight hundred cheese factories are in operation in this Province of Ontario .</p>

   <p>Among the earliest champions of the Factory System of making cheese were Messrs. Chadwick , Casswell and Ballantyne . The North Oxford Company were awarded the highest honor at the Centennial Exhibition . Messrs. J. L. Grant &amp; Co. have a fine large cold storage warehouse on the G. T. R ., and the C. P. R . have erected one on their line , which is leased by Mr. Riley . Ingersoll being the great dairy centre of Ontario it was deemed requisite to have those facilities for preserving the cheese in the hot season .

     <l n="24">The north , the south , the east , the west</l>
     <l n="25">Fierce rage doth now gleam from his eye ,</l>
     <l n="26">Resolved to conquer or to die ,</l>
     <l n="27">‘ Round him they yelp and howl and growl ,</l>
     <l n="28">He glares on them with angry scowl ,</l>
     <l n="29">They circle closer him around ,</l>
     <l n="30">He roars and springs with mighty bound ,</l>
     <l n="31">And of his powers gives ample proof ,</l>
     <l n="32">Felling them with horn and hoof ,</l>
     <l n="33">Though some lay dead upon the plain ,</l>
     <l n="34">Yet their attack was not in vain ,</l>
     <l n="35">For they have tasted of his blood ,</l>
     <l n="36">Resolved it soon shall pour a flood ,</l>
     <l n="37">He feels that they have torn his hide</l>
     <l n="38">And streams gush from each limb and side ,</l>
     <l n="39">He rushes on them in despair</l>
     <l n="40">And tosses them full high in air ,</l>
     <l n="41">But others rush on him and pull</l>
     <l n="42">Down to the earth that glorious bull ;</l>
     <l n="43">On the flesh of this noble beast</l>
     <l n="44">Their bloody jaws they soon do feast ,</l>
     <l n="45">Full worthy of a better fate</l>
     <l n="46">Far from his herd and his dear mate ,</l>
     <l n="47">Who now do look for him in vain</l>
     <l n="48">His bones do whiten now the plain .</l>

    <head>SAILOR 'S YARN .</head>
     <l n="1">While voyaging on northern seas</l>
     <l n="2">For days we could not catch a breeze ,</l>
     <l n="3">But were held fast as if in vice</l>
     <l n="4">Surrounded by the bergs of ice ,</l>
     <l n="5">We could not move the ship or boat</l>
     <l n="6">But on low , flat iceberg we did float ;</l>
     <l n="7">Of provisions we took good store</l>
     <l n="8">With big oars we rowed the berg to shore ,</l>
     <l n="9">And pride and joy each one feels</l>
     <l n="10">When we had caught ten thousand seals ,</l>
     <l n="11">And our brave boys each one they dare</l>
     <l n="12">To boldly capture great white bear ;</l>
     <l n="13">On floating berg we built with boards</l>
     <l n="14">A storehouse for to hold our hordes ,</l>
     <l n="15">We had a stove and stock of coal ,</l>
     <l n="16">So we enjoyed this voyage droll ,</l>
     <l n="17">In centre of berg we dug a hole</l>
     <l n="18">And erected a strong pole ,</l>
     <l n="19">The frost and ice soon held it fast</l>
     <l n="20">And well it served us for a mast ,</l>
     <l n="21">On which we stretched out our sails</l>
     <l n="22">And scud along before the gales ,</l>
     <l n="23">Until we came to an island</l>
     <l n="24">And on its sides it seemed highland ,</l>
     <l n="25">And Britain being queen of seas ,</l>
     <l n="26">For her this island we did seize ,</l>
     <l n="27">To give her new coaling station</l>
     <l n="28">For to benefit the nation ,</l>
     <l n="29">So when we had sailed landward</l>
     <l n="30">We erected British standard</l>
     <l n="31">On the highest mountain top ,</l>
     <l n="32">Which graceful down to sea did slope ,</l>
     <l n="33">We cast our anchor in its side</l>
     <l n="34">So to explore it far and wide ,</l>
     <l n="35">But what was our astonishment</l>
     <l n="36">Without the least admonishment ,</l>
     <l n="37">Our island soon away did float</l>

     <l n="39">Can you believe this wondrous tale ?</l>
     <l n="40">It proved to be a monster whale ,</l>
     <l n="41">And o'er the ocean quick it flew</l>

    <head>ADVENTURES WITH BEARS .</head>
     <l n="1">I bought of land two miles square ,</l>
     <l n="2">I knew not it contained a bear ,</l>
     <l n="3">I never thought there would be any ,</l>
     <l n="4">But alas , I found many ;</l>
     <l n="5">The bush was thick and mat and tangle ,</l>
     <l n="6">It made it a perfect jungle ,</l>
     <l n="7">But one mile square of good dry land</l>
     <l n="8">Was enough for me to take in hand ;</l>
     <l n="9">Swamp I could reach but when frozen ,</l>
     <l n="10">Then I saw bears by the dozen ,</l>
     <l n="11">Thick as monkies in Africa ,</l>
     <l n="12">And many a strange trick I saw ,</l>
     <l n="13">Gamboling with the greatest ease ,</l>
     <l n="14">High up the trunks of the big trees ,</l>
     <l n="15">While some were swinging from branches</l>
     <l n="16">And hanging on them with their haunches ;</l>
     <l n="17">But quietly I then tilled my farm ,</l>
     <l n="18">The bears at first done me no harm ,</l>
     <l n="19">Till one night I was roused by dogs ,</l>
     <l n="20">And found a bear was at my hogs ,</l>
     <l n="21">He threw a pig across each shoulder</l>
     <l n="22">And there I was a sad beholder ,</l>
     <l n="23">But to the house I quickly run</l>
     <l n="24">For to procure my loaded gun ,</l>
     <l n="25">And as he could not run but slow ,</l>
     <l n="26">So heavy laden through the snow ,</l>
     <l n="27">I him full soon did overtake ,</l>
     <l n="28">And his courage quick I did shake ,</l>
     <l n="29">For by the leg my good bold dog</l>
     <l n="30">He bravely caught the thievish rogue ,</l>
     <l n="31">And this move made him soon fork o'er</l>
     <l n="32">To me at once the largest porker ,</l>
     <l n="33">For moment squeeze it did pig stun ,</l>
     <l n="34">But up he rose and quick he run ,</l>
     <l n="35">The bear now scared his only hope ,</l>
     <l n="36">To let at once the other pig drop ,</l>
     <l n="37">I shot the bear right through the eyes</l>
     <l n="38">And secured a valued prize ,</l>
     <l n="39">There 's nothing I love so to eat</l>
     <l n="40">In winter time as the bear 's meat ,</l>
     <l n="41">So a victory I soon won</l>
     <l n="42">And sold for high price grease and skin ;</l>
     <l n="43">The bears on honey love to thrive ,</l>
     <l n="44">One morn was wrecked my best beehive ,</l>
     <l n="45">That day I was to sell the honey</l>
     <l n="46">For to raise some ready money ,</l>
     <l n="47">But bear my views he did despise</l>
     <l n="48">And proudly carried off the prize ;</l>
     <l n="49">That night I set a good spring gun ,</l>
     <l n="50">With rails I built for him a run ,</l>
     <l n="51">Open all way to hive of bees ,</l>
     <l n="52">He tried again a hive to seize ,</l>
     <l n="53">But all his efforts were in vain ,</l>
     <l n="54">He sprung the gun and he was slain ,</l>
     <l n="55">O'er the fact I felt quite funny</l>
     <l n="56">It well repaid me for my honey ;</l>
     <l n="57">One bear was playing on me joke ,</l>
     <l n="58">Carrying off all my young stock ,</l>
     <l n="59">I set my trap , built round it fence ,</l>
     <l n="60">Resolved he ne'er would get from thence ,</l>
     <l n="61">But at the first he did me hoax ,</l>
     <l n="62">For he was cunning as a fox ,</l>
     <l n="63">He dug under and stole my bait ,</l>
     <l n="64">But I next sunk trap and sealed his fate ,</l>
     <l n="65">My good iron trap again it caught</l>
     <l n="66">A great bear but it came to naught ,</l>
     <l n="67">Breakfast he had at my expense</l>
     <l n="68">And he then showed wondrous sense ,</l>
     <l n="69">Trap he picked up with greatest ease</l>
     <l n="70">And dashed it to pieces on the trees ,</l>
     <l n="71">But blacksmith soon did it repair</l>
     <l n="72">For I was bound to have that bear ,</l>
     <l n="73">I attached to trap a heavy clog ,</l>
     <l n="74">It was like lifting a small log ,</l>
     <l n="75">I drove in it some sharp iron spikes</l>
     <l n="76">Which would cut deep each time he strikes ,</l>
     <l n="77">He tried again to steal my bait</l>
     <l n="78">And break my trap at the old rate ,</l>
     <l n="79">But he soon dashed out his own brains ,</l>
     <l n="80">His carcass it brought me great gains ;</l>
     <l n="81">A neighbour man who would not work</l>
     <l n="82">I thought that he did steal my pork ,</l>
     <l n="83">But at last I found long black hairs ,</l>
     <l n="84">Then I knew it was the bears ,</l>
     <l n="85">I put through barrels rods of iron</l>
     <l n="86">So they a bear neck would environ ,</l>
     <l n="87">And rods together they would snap ,</l>
     <l n="88">I found him choked quite dead in trap ,</l>
     <l n="89">Since then my strife with bears did cease ,</l>
     <l n="90">Now many years I 've lived in peace .</l>

     <l n="1">We will now sing in thoughtful strain</l>
     <l n="2">Of wars in Queen Victoria 's reign .</l>
     <l n="3">The Russian bear did ages lurk ,</l>
     <l n="4">All ready for to spring on Turk ,</l>
     <l n="5">For Russian statesmen did divine</l>
     <l n="6">That they should conquer Constantine ,</l>
     <l n="7">But like a greyhound after hare</l>
     <l n="8">The Lion did drive back the Bear ,</l>
     <l n="9">And made it feel the British rule</l>
     <l n="10">At gates of strong Sebastopol .</l>
     <l n="11">Then insolent was Persia ,</l>
     <l n="12">Till Lion had to dictate law ,</l>
     <l n="13">And while engaged in scenes like these</l>
     <l n="14">He was attacked by the Chinese ,</l>
     <l n="15">And for this outrage all so wanton</l>
     <l n="16">He then resolved to seize on Canton .</l>
     <l n="17">But soon there came a dismal cry</l>
     <l n="18">Of slaughter 'd Britons from Delhi ,</l>
     <l n="19">The Bengal Tiger sick with gore</l>
     <l n="20">Did tremble at the Lion 's roar ,</l>
     <l n="21">But Britain got a serious shock</l>
     <l n="22">By losing of brave Havelock ,</l>
     <l n="23">But Campbell ‘ mid a numerous foe</l>
     <l n="24">Full quick these armed hosts did o'erthrow ,</l>
     <l n="25">In Abyssinian dungeons vile</l>
     <l n="26">Lay captives of Great Britain 's isle ,</l>
     <l n="27">But soon the tyrant Theodore</l>
     <l n="28">Lay sadly weltering in his gore .</l>
     <l n="29">The savage tribes of Ashantee</l>
     <l n="30">From British troops did quickly flee ,</l>
     <l n="31">In Afghan and Zulu wars</l>
     <l n="32">Many did find their deadly scars ;</l>
     <l n="33">In the land of the Pharaohs</l>
     <l n="34">The Christians suffered cruel woes ,</l>
     <l n="35">Till in Alexandria Bay</l>
     <l n="36">The British iron clads did display ,</l>
     <l n="37">The mighty power they did wield ,</l>
     <l n="38">While their steel sides from harm did shield ,</l>
     <l n="39">And British army on the land</l>
     <l n="40">Marched bravely o'er the burning sand ,</l>
     <l n="41">And Arabi found ‘ twas useless labor ,</l>
     <l n="42">His strong trench of Tel-el-Kebir ,</l>
     <l n="43">Egyptians did not wish to feel</l>
     <l n="44">In their breasts cold British steel ,</l>
     <l n="45">Their great power was soon laid low</l>
     <l n="46">And Wolseley entered Grand Cairo .</l>
     <l n="47">Egyptians now no more revile</l>
     <l n="48">The Christians on the banks of Nile .</l>
     <l n="49">We have sung three heroes ’ names .</l>
     <l n="50">Havelock from the land of Thames ,</l>
     <l n="51">And Campbell from the banks of Clyde ,</l>
     <l n="52">And Wolseley from Liffy 's side ,</l>
     <l n="53">When rose , thistle , shamrock unite</l>
     <l n="54">They do prove victors in the fight ,</l>
     <l n="55">Now Britain once more does command</l>
     <l n="56">Respect alike on sea and land ,</l>
     <l n="57">But now may wars forever cease</l>
     <l n="58">And mankind ever live in peace .</l>
