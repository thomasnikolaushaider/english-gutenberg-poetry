      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="2">Upon a windy night of stars that fell</l>
       <l n="3">At the wind 's spoken spell ,</l>
       <l n="4">Swept with sharp strokes of agonizing light</l>
       <l n="5">From the clear gulf of night ,</l>
       <l n="6">Between the fixed and fallen glories one</l>
       <l n="7">Against my vision shone ,</l>
       <l n="8">More fair and fearful and divine than they</l>
       <l n="9">That measure night and day ,</l>
       <l n="10">And worthier worship ; and within mine eyes</l>
       <l n="11">The formless folded skies</l>
       <l n="12">Took shape and were unfolded like as flowers .</l>
       <l n="13">And I beheld the hours</l>
       <l n="14">As maidens , and the days as labouring men ,</l>
       <l n="15">And the soft nights again</l>
       <l n="16">As wearied women to their own souls wed ,</l>
       <l n="17">And ages as the dead .</l>
       <l n="18">And over these living , and them that died ,</l>
       <l n="19">From one to the other side</l>
       <l n="20">A lordlier light than comes of earth or air</l>
       <l n="21">Made the world 's future fair .</l>
       <l n="22">A woman like to love in face , but not</l>
       <l n="23">A thing of transient lot —</l>
       <l n="24">And like to hope , but having hold on truth —</l>
       <l n="25">And like to joy or youth ,</l>
       <l n="26">Save that upon the rock her feet were set —</l>
       <l n="27">And like what men forget ,</l>
       <l n="28">Faith , innocence , high thought , laborious peace —</l>
       <l n="29">And yet like none of these ,</l>
       <l n="30">Being not as these are mortal , but with eyes</l>
       <l n="31">That sounded the deep skies</l>
       <l n="32">And clove like wings or arrows their clear way</l>
       <l n="33">Through night and dawn and day —</l>
       <l n="34">So fair a presence over star and sun</l>
       <l n="35">Stood , making these as one .</l>
       <l n="36">For in the shadow of her shape were all</l>
       <l n="37">Darkened and held in thrall ,</l>
       <l n="38">So mightier rose she past them ; and I felt</l>
       <l n="39">Whose form , whose likeness knelt</l>
       <l n="40">With covered hair and face and clasped her knees ;</l>
       <l n="41">And knew the first of these</l>
       <l n="42">Was Freedom , and the second Italy .</l>
       <l n="43">And what sad words said she</l>
       <l n="44">For mine own grief I knew not , nor had heart</l>
       <l n="45">Therewith to bear my part</l>
       <l n="46">And set my songs to sorrow ; nor to hear</l>
       <l n="47">How tear by sacred tear</l>
       <l n="48">Fell from her eyes as flowers or notes that fall</l>
       <l n="49">In some slain feaster 's hall</l>
       <l n="50">Where in mid music and melodious breath</l>
       <l n="51">Men singing have seen death .</l>
       <l n="52">So fair , so lost , so sweet she knelt ; or so</l>
       <l n="53">In our lost eyes below</l>
       <l n="54">Seemed to us sorrowing ; and her speech being said ,</l>
       <l n="55">Fell , as one who falls dead .</l>
       <l n="56">And for a little she too wept , who stood</l>
       <l n="57">Above the dust and blood</l>
       <l n="58">And thrones and troubles of the world ; then spake ,</l>
       <l n="59">As who bids dead men wake .</l>
       <l n="60">“ Because the years were heavy on thy head ;</l>
       <l n="61">Because dead things are dead ;</l>
       <l n="62">Because thy chosen on hill-side , city and plain</l>
       <l n="63">Are shed as drops of rain ;</l>
       <l n="64">Because all earth was black , all heaven was blind ,</l>
       <l n="65">And we cast out of mind ;</l>
       <l n="66">Because men wept , saying Freedom , knowing of thee ,</l>
       <l n="67">Child , that thou wast not free ;</l>
       <l n="68">Because wherever blood was not shame was</l>
       <l n="69">Where thy pure foot did pass ;</l>
       <l n="70">Because on Promethean rocks distent</l>
       <l n="71">Thee fouler eagles rent ;</l>
       <l n="72">Because a serpent stains with slime and foam</l>
       <l n="73">This that is not thy Rome ;</l>
       <l n="74">Child of my womb , whose limbs were made in me ,</l>
       <l n="75">Have I forgotten thee ?</l>
       <l n="76">In all thy dreams through all these years on wing ,</l>
       <l n="77">Hast thou dreamed such a thing ?</l>
       <l n="78">The mortal mother-bird outsoars her nest ,</l>
       <l n="79">The child outgrows the breast ;</l>
       <l n="80">But suns as stars shall fall from heaven and cease ,</l>
       <l n="81">Ere we twain be as these ;</l>
       <l n="82">Yea , utmost skies forget their utmost sun ,</l>
       <l n="83">Ere we twain be not one .</l>
       <l n="84">My lesser jewels sewn on skirt and hem ,</l>
       <l n="85">I have no heed of them</l>
       <l n="86">Obscured and flawed by sloth or craft or power ;</l>
       <l n="87">But thou , that wast my flower ,</l>
       <l n="88">The blossom bound between my brows and worn</l>
       <l n="89">In sight of even and morn</l>
       <l n="90">From the last ember of the flameless west</l>
       <l n="91">To the dawn 's baring breast —</l>
       <l n="92">I were not Freedom if thou wert not free ,</l>
       <l n="93">Nor thou wert Italy .</l>
       <l n="94">O mystic rose ingrained with blood , impearled</l>
       <l n="95">With tears of all the world !</l>
       <l n="96">The torpor of their blind brute-ridden trance</l>
       <l n="97">Kills England and chills France ;</l>
       <l n="98">And Spain sobs hard through strangling blood ; and snows</l>
       <l n="99">Hide the huge eastern woes .</l>
       <l n="100">But thou , twin-born with morning , nursed of noon ,</l>
       <l n="101">And blessed of star and moon !</l>
       <l n="102">What shall avail to assail thee any more ,</l>
       <l n="103">From sacred shore to shore ?</l>
       <l n="104">Have Time and Love not knelt down at thy feet ,</l>
       <l n="105">Thy sore , thy soiled , thy sweet ,</l>
       <l n="106">Fresh from the flints and mire of murderous ways</l>
       <l n="107">And dust of travelling days ?</l>
       <l n="108">Hath Time not kissed them , Love not washed them fair ,</l>
       <l n="109">And wiped with tears and hair ?</l>
       <l n="110">Though God forget thee , I will not forget ;</l>
       <l n="111">Though heaven and earth be set</l>
       <l n="112">Against thee , O unconquerable child ,</l>
       <l n="113">Abused , abased , reviled ,</l>
       <l n="114">Lift thou not less from no funereal bed</l>
       <l n="115">Thine undishonoured head ;</l>
       <l n="116">Love thou not less , by lips of thine once prest ,</l>
       <l n="117">This my now barren breast ;</l>
       <l n="118">Seek thou not less , being well assured thereof ,</l>
       <l n="119">O child , my latest love .</l>
       <l n="120">For now the barren bosom shall bear fruit ,</l>
       <l n="121">Songs leap from lips long mute ,</l>
       <l n="122">And with my milk the mouths of nations fed</l>
       <l n="123">Again be glad and red</l>
       <l n="124">That were worn white with hunger and sorrow and thirst ;</l>
       <l n="125">And thou , most fair and first ,</l>
       <l n="126">Thou whose warm hands and sweet live lips I feel</l>
       <l n="127">Upon me for a seal ,</l>
       <l n="128">Thou whose least looks , whose smiles and little sighs ,</l>
       <l n="129">Whose passionate pure eyes ,</l>
       <l n="130">Whose dear fair limbs that neither bonds could bruise</l>
       <l n="131">Nor hate of men misuse ,</l>
       <l n="132">Whose flower-like breath and bosom , O my child ,</l>
       <l n="133">O mine and undefiled ,</l>
       <l n="134">Fill with such tears as burn like bitter wine</l>
       <l n="135">These mother 's eyes of mine ,</l>
       <l n="136">Thrill with huge passions and primeval pains</l>
       <l n="137">The fullness of my veins ,</l>
       <l n="138">O sweetest head seen higher than any stands ,</l>
       <l n="139">I touch thee with mine hands ,</l>
       <l n="140">I lay my lips upon thee , O thou most sweet ,</l>
       <l n="141">To lift thee on thy feet</l>
       <l n="142">And with the fire of mine to fill thine eyes ;</l>
       <l n="143">I say unto thee , Arise . ”</l>

       <l n="274">That double-headed pest ;</l>
       <l n="275">So , triple-crowned with fear and fraud and shame ,</l>
       <l n="276">He of whom treason came ,</l>
       <l n="277">The herdsman of the Gadarean swine ;</l>
