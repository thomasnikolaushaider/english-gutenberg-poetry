     <l n="2">Mother of life and death and all men 's days ,</l>
     <l n="3">Earth , whom I chief of all men born would bless ,</l>
     <l n="4">And call thee with more loving lips than theirs</l>
     <l n="5">Mother , for of this very body of thine</l>
     <l n="6">And living blood I have my breath and live ,</l>
     <l n="7">Behold me , even thy son , me crowned of men ,</l>
     <l n="8">Me made thy child by that strong cunning God</l>
     <l n="9">Who fashions fire and iron , who begat</l>
     <l n="10">Me for a sword and beacon-fire on thee ,</l>
     <l n="11">Me fosterling of Pallas , in her shade 10</l>
     <l n="12">Reared , that I first might pay the nursing debt ,</l>
     <l n="13">Hallowing her fame with flower of third-year feasts ,</l>
     <l n="14">And first bow down the bridled strength of steeds</l>
     <l n="15">To lose the wild wont of their birth , and bear</l>
     <l n="16">Clasp of man 's knees and steerage of his hand ,</l>
     <l n="17">Or fourfold service of his fire-swift wheels</l>
     <l n="18">That whirl the four-yoked chariot ; me the king</l>
     <l n="19">Who stand before thee naked now , and cry ,</l>
     <l n="20">O holy and general mother of all men born ,</l>
     <l n="21">But mother most and motherliest of mine , 20</l>
     <l n="22">Earth , for I ask thee rather of all the Gods ,</l>
     <l n="23">What have we done ? what word mistimed or work</l>
     <l n="24">Hath winged the wild feet of this timeless curse</l>
     <l n="25">To fall as fire upon us ? Lo , I stand</l>
     <l n="26">Here on this brow 's crown of the city 's head</l>
     <l n="27">That crowns its lovely body , till death 's hour</l>
     <l n="28">Waste it ; but now the dew of dawn and birth</l>
     <l n="29">Is fresh upon it from thy womb , and we</l>
     <l n="30">Behold it born how beauteous ; one day more</l>
     <l n="31">I see the world 's wheel of the circling sun 30</l>
     <l n="32">Roll up rejoicing to regard on earth</l>
     <l n="33">This one thing goodliest , fair as heaven or he ,</l>
     <l n="34">Worth a God 's gaze or strife of Gods ; but now</l>
     <l n="35">Would this day 's ebb of their spent wave of strife</l>
     <l n="36">Sweep it to sea , wash it on wreck , and leave</l>
     <l n="37">A costless thing contemned ; and in our stead ,</l>
     <l n="38">Where these walls were and sounding streets of men ,</l>
     <l n="39">Make wide a waste for tongueless water-herds</l>
     <l n="40">And spoil of ravening fishes ; that no more</l>
     <l n="41">Should men say , Here was Athens . This shalt thou 40</l>
     <l n="42">Sustain not , nor thy son endure to see ,</l>
     <l n="43">Nor thou to live and look on ; for the womb</l>
     <l n="44">Bare me not base that bare me miserable ,</l>
     <l n="45">To hear this loud brood of the Thracian foam</l>
     <l n="46">Break its broad strength of billowy-beating war</l>
     <l n="47">Here , and upon it as a blast of death</l>
     <l n="48">Blowing , the keen wrath of a fire-souled king ,</l>
     <l n="49">A strange growth grafted on our natural soil ,</l>
     <l n="50">A root of Thrace in Eleusinian earth</l>
     <l n="51">Set for no comfort to the kindly land , 50</l>
     <l n="52">Son of the sea 's lord and our first-born foe ,</l>
     <l n="53">Eumolpus ; nothing sweet in ears of thine</l>
     <l n="54">The music of his making , nor a song</l>
     <l n="55">Toward hopes of ours auspicious ; for the note</l>
     <l n="56">Rings as for death oracular to thy sons</l>
     <l n="57">That goes before him on the sea-wind blown</l>
     <l n="58">Full of this charge laid on me , to put out</l>
     <l n="59">The brief light kindled of mine own child 's life ,</l>
     <l n="60">Or with this helmsman hand that steers the state</l>
     <l n="61">Run right on the under shoal and ridge of death 60</l>
     <l n="62">The populous ship with all its fraughtage gone</l>
     <l n="63">And sails that were to take the wind of time</l>
     <l n="64">Rent , and the tackling that should hold out fast</l>
     <l n="65">In confluent surge of loud calamities</l>
     <l n="66">Broken , with spars of rudders and lost oars</l>
     <l n="67">That were to row toward harbour and find rest</l>
     <l n="68">In some most glorious haven of all the world</l>
     <l n="69">And else may never near it : such a song</l>
     <l n="70">The Gods have set his lips on fire withal</l>
     <l n="71">Who threatens now in all their names to bring 70</l>
     <l n="72">Ruin ; but none of these , thou knowest , have I</l>
     <l n="73">Chid with my tongue or cursed at heart for grief ,</l>
     <l n="74">Knowing how the soul runs reinless on sheer death</l>
     <l n="75">Whose grief or joy takes part against the Gods .</l>
     <l n="76">And what they will is more than our desire ,</l>
     <l n="77">And their desire is more than what we will .</l>
     <l n="78">For no man 's will and no desire of man 's</l>
     <l n="79">Shall stand as doth a God 's will . Yet , O fair</l>
     <l n="80">Mother , that seest me how I cast no word</l>
     <l n="81">Against them , plead no reason , crave no cause , 80</l>
     <l n="82">Boast me not blameless , nor beweep me wronged ,</l>
     <l n="83">By this fair wreath of towers we have decked thee with ,</l>
     <l n="84">This chaplet that we give thee woven of walls ,</l>
     <l n="85">This girdle of gate and temple and citadel</l>
     <l n="86">Drawn round beneath thy bosom , and fast linked</l>
     <l n="87">As to thine heart 's root — this dear crown of thine ,</l>
     <l n="88">This present light , this city — be not thou</l>
     <l n="89">Slow to take heed nor slack to strengthen her ,</l>
     <l n="90">Fare we so short-lived howsoe'er , and pay</l>
     <l n="91">What price we may to ransom thee thy town , 90</l>
     <l n="92">Not me my life ; but thou that diest not , thou ,</l>
     <l n="93">Though all our house die for this people 's sake ,</l>
     <l n="94">Keep thou for ours thy crown our city , guard</l>
     <l n="95">And give it life the lovelier that we died .</l>

     <l n="1">Sun , that hast lightened and loosed by thy might</l>
     <l n="2">Ocean and Earth from the lordship of night ,</l>
     <l n="3">Quickening with vision his eye that was veiled ,</l>
     <l n="4">Freshening the force in her heart that had failed ,</l>
     <l n="5">That sister fettered and blinded brother</l>
     <l n="6">Should have sight by thy grace and delight of each other , 100</l>
     <l n="7">Behold now and see</l>
     <l n="8">What profit is given them of thee ;</l>
     <l n="9">What wrath has enkindled with madness of mind</l>
     <l n="10">Her limbs that were bounden , his face that was blind ,</l>
     <l n="11">To be locked as in wrestle together , and lighten</l>
     <l n="12">With fire that shall darken thy fire in the sky ,</l>
     <l n="13">Body to body and eye against eye</l>
     <l n="14">In a war against kind ,</l>
     <l n="15">Till the bloom of her fields and her high hills whiten</l>
     <l n="16">With the foam of his waves more high . 110</l>
     <l n="17">For the sea-marks set to divide of old</l>

     <l n="20">His wine-bright waves from her vineyards ’ fold ,</l>
     <l n="21">Frail forces we find</l>
     <l n="22">To bridle the spirit of Gods or bind</l>
     <l n="23">Till the heat of their hearts wax cold .</l>
     <l n="24">But the peace that was stablished between them to stand</l>
     <l n="25">Is rent now in twain by the strength of his hand</l>
     <l n="26">Who stirs up the storm of his sons overbold 120</l>
     <l n="27">To pluck from fight what he lost of right ,</l>
     <l n="28">By council and judgment of Gods that spake</l>
     <l n="29">And gave great Pallas the strife 's fair stake ,</l>
     <l n="30">The lordship and love of the lovely land ,</l>
     <l n="31">The grace of the town that hath on it for crown</l>

     <l n="37">Of the manifold births they bear .</l>
     <l n="38">Too well , too well was the great stake worth</l>
     <l n="39">A strife divine for the Gods to judge ,</l>
     <l n="40">A crowned God 's triumph , a foiled God 's grudge ,</l>

     <l n="47">Slaves of no man , subjects of none ;</l>
     <l n="48">A wonder enthroned on the hills and sea ,</l>
     <l n="49">A maiden crowned with a fourfold glory</l>
     <l n="50">That none from the pride of her head may rend ,</l>

     <l n="57">A noise is arisen against us of waters , [ Str . 1 .</l>
     <l n="58">A sound as of battle come up from the sea .</l>
     <l n="59">Strange hunters are hard on us , hearts without pity ;</l>
     <l n="60">They have staked their nets round the fair young city ,</l>
     <l n="61">That the sons of her strength and her virgin daughters</l>

     <l n="63">And we know not yet of the word unwritten , [ Ant . 1 .</l>

     <l n="89">All tender flower and fruit ,</l>
     <l n="90">With one strike blind and mute the heaven 's fair features , 180</l>
     <l n="91">Pluck out the eyes of morn , and make</l>

     <l n="114">Her green soft virginal shoot</l>
     <l n="115">Was plucked from the stream-side cover</l>

   <p>Wise of word was he too surely , but with deadlier wisdom wise , First who gave thee name from under earth , no breath from upper skies , When , foredoomed to this day 's darkness , their first daylight filled thine eyes .</p>

   <p>Child , my child that wast and art but death 's and now no more of mine , Half my heart is cloven with anguish by the sword made sharp for thine , 870 Half exalts its wing for triumph , that I bare thee thus divine .</p>

   <p>Though for me the sword 's edge thirst that sets no point against thy breast , Mother , O my mother , where I drank of life and fell on rest , Thine , not mine , is all the grief that marks this hour accurst and blest .</p>

   <p>Sweet thy sleep and sweet the bosom was that gave thee sleep and birth ; Harder now the breast , and girded with no marriage-band for girth , Where thine head shall sleep , the namechild of the lords of under earth .</p>

   <p>Day to day makes answer , first to last , and life to death ; but I , Born for death 's sake , die for life 's sake , if indeed this be to die , This my doom that seals me deathless till the springs of time run dry .</p>

     <l n="42">For folk to hear that wist how dire a God</l>
     <l n="43">Begat this peril to them , what strong race</l>
     <l n="44">Fathered the sea-born tongue that sang them death , 1530</l>
     <l n="45">Threatening ; so raged through the red foam of fight</l>
     <l n="46">Poseidon 's son Eumolpus ; and the war</l>
     <l n="47">Quailed round him coming , and our side bore back ,</l>
     <l n="48">As a stream thwarted by the wind and sea</l>
     <l n="49">That meet it midway mouth to mouth , and beat</l>
     <l n="50">The flood back of its issue ; but the king</l>

     <l n="53">Send me what end seems good now in thy sight ,</l>

     <l n="55">Quick on his lips yet like a blast of fire</l>
     <l n="56">Blew them together ; and round its lords that met</l>
     <l n="57">Paused all the reeling battle ; two main waves</l>
     <l n="58">Meeting , one hurled sheer from the sea-wall back</l>
     <l n="59">That shocks it sideways , one right in from sea</l>
     <l n="60">Charging , that full in face takes at one blow</l>
     <l n="61">That whole recoil and ruin , with less fear</l>
     <l n="62">Startle men 's eyes late shipwrecked ; for a breath</l>
     <l n="63">Crest fronting crest hung , wave to wave rose poised ,</l>
     <l n="64">Then clashed , breaker to breaker ; cloud with cloud 1550</l>
     <l n="65">In heaven , chariot with chariot closed on earth ,</l>
     <l n="66">One fourfold flash and thunder ; yet a breath ,</l>
     <l n="67">And with the king 's spear through his red heart 's root</l>
     <l n="68">Driven , like a rock split from its hill-side , fell</l>
     <l n="69">Hurled under his own horsehoofs dead on earth</l>
     <l n="70">The sea-beast that made war on earth from sea ,</l>
     <l n="71">Dumb , with no shrill note left of storming song ,</l>
     <l n="72">Eumolpus ; and his whole host with one stroke</l>
     <l n="73">Spear-stricken through its dense deep iron heart</l>
     <l n="74">Fell hurtling from us , and in fierce recoil 1560</l>
     <l n="75">Drew seaward as with one wide wail of waves ,</l>
     <l n="76">Resorbed with reluctation ; such a groan</l>
     <l n="77">Rose from the fluctuant refluence of its ranks ,</l>
     <l n="78">Sucked sullen back and strengthless ; but scarce yet</l>
     <l n="79">The steeds had sprung and wheels had bruised their lord</l>
     <l n="80">Fallen , when from highest height of the sundering heaven</l>
     <l n="81">The Father for his brother 's son 's sake slain</l>
     <l n="82">Sent a sheer shaft of lightning writhen and smote</l>
     <l n="83">Right on his son 's son 's forehead , that unhelmed</l>
     <l n="84">Shone like the star that shines down storm , and gave 1570</l>
     <l n="85">Light to men 's eyes that saw thy lord their king</l>
     <l n="86">Stand and take breath from battle ; then too soon</l>
     <l n="87">Saw sink down as a sunset in sea-mist</l>
     <l n="88">The high bright head that here in van of the earth</l>
     <l n="89">Rose like a headland , and through storm and night</l>
     <l n="90">Took all the sea 's wrath on it ; and now dead</l>
     <l n="91">They bring thee back by war-forsaken ways</l>
     <l n="92">The strength called once thy husband , the great guard</l>
     <l n="93">That was of all men , stay of all men 's lives ,</l>
     <l n="94">They bear him slain of no man but a God , 1580</l>
     <l n="95">Godlike ; and toward him dead the city 's gates</l>
     <l n="96">Fling their arms open mother-like , through him</l>
     <l n="97">Saved ; and the whole clear land is purged of war .</l>
