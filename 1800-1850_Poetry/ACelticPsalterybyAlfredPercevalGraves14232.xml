    <p>TO THE RIGHT HON . DAVID LLOYD GEORGE PRIME MINISTER OF GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND This Psaltery of Celtic Songs To you by bounden right belongs ; For ere War 's thunder round us broke , To your content its chord I woke , Where Cymru 's Prince in fealty pure Knelt for his Sire 's Investiture . Nor less these lays are yours but more , In memory of the Eisteddfod floor You flooded with a choral throng That poured God 's praise a whole day long . But most , O Celtic Seer , to you This Song Wreath of our Race is due , Since high o'er hatred and division , You have scaled the Peak and seen the Vision Of Freedom , breaking into birth From out an agonising Earth .</p>

    <head>PREFACE</head>
    <p n="1">I have called this volume of verse a Celtic Psaltery because it mainly consists of close and free translations from Irish , Scotch Gaelic , and Welsh Poetry of a religious or serious character . The first half of the book is concerned with Irish poems . The first group of these starts with the dawning of Christianity out of Pagan darkness , and the spiritualising of the Early Irish by the wisdom to be found in the conversations between King Cormac MacArt — the Irish ancestor of our Royal Family — and his son and successor , King Carbery . Here also will be found those pregnant ninth-century utterances known as the “ Irish Triads . ”</p>
    <p n="2">Next follow poems attributed or relating to some of the Irish saints — Patrick , Columba , Brigit , Moling ; Lays of Monk and Hermit , Religious Invocations , Reflections and Charms and Lamentations for the Dead , including a remarkable early Irish poem entitled “ The Mothers ’ Lament at the Slaughter of the Innocents ” and a powerful peasant poem , “ The Keening of Mary . ” The Irish section is ended by a set of songs suggested by Irish folk-tunes .</p>
    <p n="3">Of the early Irish Religious Poetry here translated it may be observed that the originals are not only remarkable for fine metrical form but for their cheerful spirituality , their open-air freshness and their occasional touches of kindly humour . “ Irish religious poetry , ” it has been well said , “ ranges from single quatrains to lengthy compositions dealing with all the varied aspects of religious life . Many of them give us a fascinating insight into the peculiar character of the early Irish Church , which differed in so many ways from the Christian world . We see the hermit in his lonely cell , the monk at his devotions or at his work of copying in the scriptorium or under the open sky ; or we hear the ascetic who , alone or with twelve chosen companions , has left one of the great monasteries in order to live in greater solitude among the woods or mountains , or on a lonely island . The fact that so many of these poems are fathered upon well-known saints emphasises the friendly attitude of the native clergy towards vernacular poetry . "[ A ]</p>
    <p n="4">I have endeavoured as far as possible to preserve in my translations both the character of these poems and their metrical form . But the latter attempt can be only a mere approximation owing to the strict rules of early Irish verse both as regards alliteration and vowel consonance . Still the use of the “ inlaid rhyme ” and other assonantal devices have , it is to be hoped , brought my renderings nearer in vocal effect to the originals than the use of more familiar English verse methods would have done .</p>
    <p n="5">The same metrical difficulties have met me when translating the Welsh sacred and spiritual poems which form the second division of this volume . But they have been more easy to grapple with — in part because I have had more assistance in dealing with the older Cymric poems from my lamented friend Mr. Sidney Richard John and other Welsh scholars , than I had in the case of the early Irish lyrics — in part because the later Welsh poems which I have rendered into English verse are generally in free , not “ strict , ” metres , and therefore present no great difficulty to the translator .</p>
    <p n="6">The poems in the Welsh section are , roughly speaking , arranged in chronological order . The early Welsh poets Aneurin and Llywarch Hen are represented by two singular pieces , Llywarch Hen 's curious “ Tercets ” and Aneurin 's “ Ode to the Months . ” In both of these , nature poetry and proverbial philosophy are oddly intermingled in a manner reminiscent of the Greek Gnomic Poets . Two examples are given of the serious verse of Dafydd ab Gwilym , a contemporary of Chaucer , who though he did not , like Wordsworth , read nature into human life with that spiritual insight for which he was so remarkable , yet as a poet of fancy , the vivid , delicate , sympathetic fancy of the Celt , still remains unmatched . Amongst Dafydd 's contemporaries and successors , Iolo Goch 's noble poem , “ The Labourer , ” very appropriate to our breadless days , Lewis Glyn Cothi 's touching elegy on his little son John , and Dr. Sion Cent 's epigrammatic “ The Noble 's Grave ” have been treated as far as possible in the metres of the originals , and I have gone as near as I could to the measures of Huw Morus ’ “ The Bard 's Death-Bed Confession , ” Elis Win 's “ Counsel in view of Death , ” and the Vicar Pritchard 's “ A Good Wife . ”</p>
    <p n="7">A word or two about these famous Welsh writers : Huw Morus ( Hugh Morris ) was the leading Welsh poet of the seventeenth century and a staunch Royalist , who during the Civil War proved himself the equal if not the superior of Samuel Butler as a writer of anti-Republican satire . He was also an amatory lyrist , but closed his career as the writer of some fine religious verses , notably this “ Death-Bed Confession . ” Elis Win ( Ellis Wynne ) was not only an excellent writer of verse but one of the masters of Welsh prose . His “ Vision of the Sleeping Bard ” is , indeed , one of the most beautifully written works in the Welsh language . Though in many respects indebted to “ Quevedo 's Visions , ” the matter of Elis Win 's book is distinctly original , and most poetically expressed , though he is none the less able to expose and scourge the immoralities of his age .</p>
    <p n="8">The Vicar Pritchard , otherwise the Rev . Rhys Pritchard , was the author of the famous “ Welshmen 's Candle , ” “ Cannwyll y Cymry , ” written in the free metres , first published in 1646 — completed in 1672 . This consisted of a series of moral verses in the metres of the old folk-songs ( Penillion Telyn ) and remained dear to the hearts of the Welsh people for two centuries . Next may be mentioned Goronwy Owen , educated by the poet Lewis Morris , grandfather of the author of “ Songs of Two Worlds ” and “ The Epic of Hades . ” As the Rev . Elvet Lewis writes of him : “ Here at once we meet the true artist lost in his art . His humour is as playful as if the hand of a stern fate had never struck him on the face . His muse can laugh and make others laugh , or it can weep and make others weep . ” A specimen is given of one of his best known poems , “ An Ode on the Day of Judgment , ” reproducing , as far as my powers have permitted , its final and internal rhymes and other metrical effects .</p>
    <p n="9">We now reach the most individual of the modern Welsh religious and philosophical poets , Islwyn ( William Thomas ) , who took his Bardic title from the hill of Islwyn in his native Monmouthshire . He was greatly influenced by the poetry of Wordsworth , but was in no sense an imitator . Yet whilst , in the words of one of the Triads , he possessed the three things essential to poetic genius , “ an eye to see nature , a heart to feel nature : and courage that dares follow nature ” — he steadfastly refused to regard poetry as an art and , by declining to use the pruning-knife , allowed the finest fruits of his poetic talents to lie buried beneath immense accumulations of weedy and inferior growth . Yet what his powers were may not be ill judged of , even in translation , by the passage from his blank verse poem , “ The Storm , ” entitled “ Behind the Veil , ” to be found on p. 94 .</p>
    <p n="10">Pantycelyn ( the Rev . William Williams ) was a co-worker with Howel Harris and Daniel Rowlands in the Methodist revival . Professor W. J . Gruffyd writes of him : “ It is not enough to say he was a hymnologist — he was much more . He is the National Poet of Wales . He had certainly the loftiest imagination of all the poets of five centuries , and his influence on the Welsh people can be gauged by the fact that a good deal of his idiom or dialect has fixed itself indelibly in modern literary Welsh . ” The Hymn , “ Marchog Jesu ! ” which represents him was translated by me at the request of the Committee responsible for the Institution Ceremony of the Prince of Wales at Carnarvon Castle .</p>
    <p n="11">Of the more modern Welsh poets represented in this volume let it be said that Ceiriog ( John Hughes ) , so called from his birth in the Ceiriog Valley , is the Burns of Welsh Poetry . Against the spirit of gloom that the Welsh Revival cast over the first half of the nineteenth century he threw himself in sharp revolt . But while the joy of life wells up and overflows in his song he was also , like all Welshmen , serious-minded , as the specimens given in my translation from his works go to prove .</p>
    <p n="12">According to Professor Lewis Jones , no poem in the strict metre is more read than Eben Farrd 's “ Dinistur Jerusalem ” ( “ The Destruction of Jerusalem ” ) , translated into kindred verse in this volume , unless indeed its popularity is rivalled by Hiraethog 's ode on “ Heddwch , ” ( “ Peace ” ) . Two extracts from the former poem are dealt with , and Hiraethog is represented by a beautiful fancy , “ Love Divine , ” taken from his “ Emanuel . ”</p>
    <p n="13">Finally , three living poets are represented in the Welsh section — Elvet Lewis by his stirring and touching “ High Tide ” ; Eifion Wyn , upon whom the mantle of Ceiriog has fallen , by two exquisitely simple and pathetic poems , “ Ora pro Nobis ” and “ A Flower-Sunday Lullaby ” ; and William John Gruffydd , the bright hope of “ Y Beirdd Newydd ” ( “ The New Poets ” ) , by his poignant ballad of “ The Old Bachelor of Ty'n y Mynydd . ”</p>
    <p n="14">There is no need for me to dwell upon the rest of the verse in this volume beyond stating that “ The Prodigal 's Return ” is a free translation from a poem on that theme by an anonymous Scotch Gaelic Bard to be found in Sinton 's “ The Poetry of Badenoch ” ; that “ Let there be joy ! ” is rendered from a Gaelic poem in Alexander Carmichael 's “ Carmina Gadelica , ” and that , finally , “ Wild Wine of Nature ” is a pretty close English version of a poem hardly to have been expected from that far from teetotal Scotch Gaelic Bard , Duncan Ban McIntyre .</p>

    <head>THE ISLE OF THE HAPPY</head>
     <l n="1">( From the Early Irish )</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Once when Bran , son of Feval , was with his warriors in his royal fort , they suddenly saw a woman in strange raiment upon the floor of the house . No one knew whence she had come or how she had entered , for the ramparts were closed . Then she sang these quatrains of Erin , the Isle of the Happy , to Bran while all the host were listening :</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">A branch I bear from Evin 's apple-trees</l>
     <l n="2">Whose shape agrees with Evin 's orchard spray ;</l>
     <l n="3">Yet never could her branches best belauded</l>
     <l n="4">Such crystal-gauded bud and bloom display .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">There is a distant Isle , deep sunk in shadows ,</l>
     <l n="6">Sea-horses round its meadows flash and flee ;</l>
     <l n="7">Full fair the course , white-swelling waves enfold it ,</l>
     <l n="8">Four pedestals uphold it o'er the sea .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">White the bronze pillars that this Fairy Curragh , [ A ]</l>
     <l n="10">The Centuries thorough , glimmering uphold .</l>
     <l n="11">Through all the World the fairest land of any</l>
     <l n="12">Is this whereon the many blooms unfold .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">And in its midst an Ancient Tree forth flowers ,</l>
     <l n="14">Whence to the Hours beauteous birds outchime ;</l>
     <l n="15">In harmony of song , with fluttering feather ,</l>
     <l n="16">They hail together each new birth of Time .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="17">And through the Isle glow all glad shades of colour ,</l>
     <l n="18">No hue of dolour mars its beauty lone .</l>
     <l n="19">‘ Tis Silver Cloud Land that we ever name it ,</l>
     <l n="20">And joy and music claim it for their own .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="21">Not here are cruel guile or loud resentment ,</l>
     <l n="22">But calm contentment , fresh and fruitful cheer ;</l>

     <l n="24">But music melting blissful on the ear .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="25">No grief , no gloom , no death , no mortal sickness ,</l>
     <l n="26">Nor any weakness our sure strength can bound ;</l>
     <l n="27">These are the signs that grace the race of Evin .</l>
     <l n="28">Beneath what other heaven are they found ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="29">A Hero fair , from out the dawn 's bright blooming ,</l>
     <l n="30">Rides forth , illuming level shore and flood ;</l>

     <l n="32">He stirs the ocean into burning blood .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="33">A host across the clear blue sea comes rowing ,</l>
     <l n="34">Their prowess showing , till they touch the shore ;</l>
     <l n="35">Thence seek the Shining Stone where Music 's measure</l>
     <l n="36">Prolongs the pleasure of the pulsing oar .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="37">It sings a strain to all the host assembled ;</l>
     <l n="38">That strain untired has trembled through all time !</l>

     <l n="40">Decay and Death have slumbered since its chime .</l>

     <l n="41">Thus happiness with wealth is o'er us stealing ,</l>

     <l n="45">Through all the lovely Isle 's unchanging hours</l>
     <l n="46">There showers and showers a stream of silver bright ;</l>
     <l n="47">A pure white cliff that from the breast of Evin</l>
     <l n="48">Mounts up to Heaven thus assures her light .</l>

    <head>THE DEVIL 'S TRIBUTE TO MOLING</head>
     <l n="1">( From the Early Irish )</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Once , when St. Moling was praying in his church , the Devil visited him in purple raiment and distinguished form . On being challenged by the saint , he declared himself to be the Christ , but on Moling 's raising the Gospel to disprove his claim , the Evil One confessed that he was Satan . “ Wherefore hast thou come ? ” asked Moling . “ For a blessing , ” the Devil replied . “ Thou shalt not have it , ” said Moling , “ for thou deservest it not . ” “ Well , then , ” said the Devil , “ bestow the full of a curse on me . ” “ What good were that to thee ? ” asked Moling . “ The venom and the hurt of the curse will be on the lips from which it will come . ” After further parley , the Devil paid this tribute to Moling :</p>

    <head>THE COMING OF SIR GALAHAD AND A VISION OF THE GRAIL</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">At the solemn Feast of Pentecost Arthur the King and his chosen Knights</l>
     <l n="2">Sat , as we sit , in the Court of Camelot side by side at The Table Round .</l>
     <l n="3">None made music , none held converse , none knew hunger , none were athirst ,</l>
     <l n="4">Each possessed with the same strange longing , each fulfilled with one</l>
     <l n="5">awful hope ;</l>
     <l n="6">Each of us fearing even to whisper what he felt to his bosom friend ,</l>
     <l n="7">Lest the spell should be snapped in sunder .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="8">Thus we sat awaiting a sign !</l>
     <l n="9">When , on a sudden , out of the distance blared the bugle that hangs at</l>
     <l n="10">the gate ;</l>
     <l n="11">Loud the barbican leaped on its hinges ; and the hollow porch and the</l>
     <l n="12">vacant hall</l>
     <l n="13">And the roof of the long resounding corridor echoed the advent of unknown</l>
     <l n="14">feet ,</l>
     <l n="15">The feet of a stranger approaching the threshold step by step irresistibly :</l>
     <l n="16">Till opened yonder door and through it strode to this Table the Virgin</l>
     <l n="17">Knight —</l>
     <l n="18">Strode and stood with uplifted vizor .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="19">Fear fell on all , save only the King !</l>
     <l n="20">Uprose Arthur , unbarred his helmet ; shone confessed the countenance chaste .</l>
     <l n="21">Then , for so the Spirit inspired him , set the youth on the Perilous Seat ;</l>
     <l n="22">Brake as he pressed it a Peal of thunder and paled the firelight , paled</l>
     <l n="23">the lamps ,</l>
     <l n="24">Such a sudden stream of splendour flooded the Feast with miraculous light ;</l>
     <l n="25">Whilst , O Wonder ! round the Table swathed in samite , dazzling bright ,</l>
     <l n="26">Passed the Presence , mystical , shadowy , ghostly gliding — the Holy Grail ,</l>
     <l n="27">Passed , though none could its shape discover , nay , not even the Virgin</l>
     <l n="28">Knight ,</l>
     <l n="29">Passed , passed with strains seraphic , incense odours , rainbow hues —</l>
     <l n="30">Passed , passed , and where it entered , suddenly melted out of sight .</l>
