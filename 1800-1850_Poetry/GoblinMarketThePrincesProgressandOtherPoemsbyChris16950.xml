       <l n="2">Morning and evening</l>
       <l n="3">Maids heard the goblins cry :</l>
       <l n="4">‘ Come buy our orchard fruits ,</l>

       <l n="6">Apples and quinces ,</l>

       <l n="15">Apricots , strawberries ;—</l>
       <l n="16">All ripe together</l>
       <l n="17">In summer weather ,—</l>
       <l n="18">Morns that pass by ,</l>
       <l n="19">Fair eves that fly ;</l>
       <l n="20">Come buy , come buy :</l>
       <l n="21">Our grapes fresh from the vine , 20</l>
       <l n="22">Pomegranates full and fine ,</l>
       <l n="23">Dates and sharp bullaces ,</l>
       <l n="24">Rare pears and greengages ,</l>

       <l n="32">Come buy , come buy . ’</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="33">Evening by evening</l>
       <l n="34">Among the brookside rushes ,</l>
       <l n="35">Laura bowed her head to hear ,</l>
       <l n="36">Lizzie veiled her blushes :</l>
       <l n="37">Crouching close together</l>
       <l n="38">In the cooling weather ,</l>
       <l n="39">With clasping arms and cautioning lips ,</l>
       <l n="40">With tingling cheeks and finger tips .</l>
       <l n="41">‘ Lie close , ’ Laura said , 40</l>
       <l n="42">Pricking up her golden head :</l>
       <l n="43">‘ We must not look at goblin men ,</l>
       <l n="44">We must not buy their fruits :</l>
       <l n="45">Who knows upon what soil they fed</l>
       <l n="46">Their hungry thirsty roots ? ’</l>
       <l n="47">‘ Come buy , ’ call the goblins</l>
       <l n="48">Hobbling down the glen .</l>
       <l n="49">‘ Oh , ’ cried Lizzie , ‘ Laura , Laura ,</l>
       <l n="50">You should not peep at goblin men . ’</l>
       <l n="51">Lizzie covered up her eyes , 50</l>
       <l n="52">Covered close lest they should look ;</l>
       <l n="53">Laura reared her glossy head ,</l>
       <l n="54">And whispered like the restless brook :</l>
       <l n="55">‘ Look , Lizzie , look , Lizzie ,</l>
       <l n="56">Down the glen tramp little men .</l>
       <l n="57">One hauls a basket ,</l>
       <l n="58">One bears a plate ,</l>
       <l n="59">One lugs a golden dish</l>
       <l n="60">Of many pounds weight .</l>
       <l n="61">How fair the vine must grow 60</l>
       <l n="62">Whose grapes are so luscious ;</l>
       <l n="63">How warm the wind must blow</l>
       <l n="64">Through those fruit bushes . ’</l>
       <l n="65">‘ No , ’ said Lizzie , ‘ No , no , no ;</l>
       <l n="66">Their offers should not charm us ,</l>
       <l n="67">Their evil gifts would harm us . ’</l>
       <l n="68">She thrust a dimpled finger</l>
       <l n="69">In each ear , shut eyes and ran :</l>
       <l n="70">Curious Laura chose to linger</l>
       <l n="71">Wondering at each merchant man . 70</l>
       <l n="72">One had a cat 's face ,</l>
       <l n="73">One whisked a tail ,</l>
       <l n="74">One tramped at a rat 's pace ,</l>
       <l n="75">One crawled like a snail ,</l>
       <l n="76">One like a wombat prowled obtuse and furry ,</l>
       <l n="77">One like a ratel tumbled hurry skurry .</l>
       <l n="78">She heard a voice like voice of doves</l>
       <l n="79">Cooing all together :</l>
       <l n="80">They sounded kind and full of loves</l>
       <l n="81">In the pleasant weather . 80</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="82">Laura stretched her gleaming neck</l>
       <l n="83">Like a rush-imbedded swan ,</l>
       <l n="84">Like a lily from the beck ,</l>
       <l n="85">Like a moonlit poplar branch ,</l>
       <l n="86">Like a vessel at the launch</l>
       <l n="87">When its last restraint is gone .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="88">Backwards up the mossy glen</l>
       <l n="89">Turned and trooped the goblin men ,</l>
       <l n="90">With their shrill repeated cry ,</l>
       <l n="91">‘ Come buy , come buy . ’ 90</l>
       <l n="92">When they reached where Laura was</l>
       <l n="93">They stood stock still upon the moss ,</l>
       <l n="94">Leering at each other ,</l>
       <l n="95">Brother with queer brother ;</l>
       <l n="96">Signalling each other ,</l>
       <l n="97">Brother with sly brother .</l>
       <l n="98">One set his basket down ,</l>
       <l n="99">One reared his plate ;</l>
       <l n="100">One began to weave a crown</l>
       <l n="101">Of tendrils , leaves , and rough nuts brown 100</l>
       <l n="102">( Men sell not such in any town ) ;</l>
       <l n="103">One heaved the golden weight</l>
       <l n="104">Of dish and fruit to offer her :</l>
       <l n="105">‘ Come buy , come buy , ’ was still their cry .</l>
       <l n="106">Laura stared but did not stir ,</l>
       <l n="107">Longed but had no money :</l>
       <l n="108">The whisk-tailed merchant bade her taste</l>
       <l n="109">In tones as smooth as honey ,</l>
       <l n="110">The cat-faced purr 'd ,</l>
       <l n="111">The rat-faced spoke a word 110</l>
       <l n="112">Of welcome , and the snail-paced even was heard ;</l>
       <l n="113">One parrot-voiced and jolly</l>
       <l n="114">Cried ‘ Pretty Goblin ’ still for ‘ Pretty Polly ; ’ —</l>
       <l n="115">One whistled like a bird .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="116">But sweet-tooth Laura spoke in haste :</l>
       <l n="117">‘ Good folk , I have no coin ;</l>
       <l n="118">To take were to purloin :</l>
       <l n="119">I have no copper in my purse ,</l>
       <l n="120">I have no silver either ,</l>
       <l n="121">And all my gold is on the furze 120</l>
       <l n="122">That shakes in windy weather</l>
       <l n="123">Above the rusty heather . ’</l>
       <l n="124">‘ You have much gold upon your head , ’</l>
       <l n="125">They answered all together :</l>
       <l n="126">‘ Buy from us with a golden curl . ’</l>
       <l n="127">She clipped a precious golden lock ,</l>
       <l n="128">She dropped a tear more rare than pearl ,</l>
       <l n="129">Then sucked their fruit globes fair or red :</l>
       <l n="130">Sweeter than honey from the rock ,</l>
       <l n="131">Stronger than man-rejoicing wine , 130</l>
       <l n="132">Clearer than water flowed that juice ;</l>
       <l n="133">She never tasted such before ,</l>
       <l n="134">How should it cloy with length of use ?</l>
       <l n="135">She sucked and sucked and sucked the more</l>
       <l n="136">Fruits which that unknown orchard bore ;</l>
       <l n="137">She sucked until her lips were sore ;</l>
       <l n="138">Then flung the emptied rinds away</l>
       <l n="139">But gathered up one kernel stone ,</l>
       <l n="140">And knew not was it night or day</l>
       <l n="141">As she turned home alone . 140</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="142">Lizzie met her at the gate</l>
       <l n="143">Full of wise upbraidings :</l>
       <l n="144">‘ Dear , you should not stay so late ,</l>
       <l n="145">Twilight is not good for maidens ;</l>
       <l n="146">Should not loiter in the glen</l>
       <l n="147">In the haunts of goblin men .</l>
       <l n="148">Do you not remember Jeanie ,</l>
       <l n="149">How she met them in the moonlight ,</l>
       <l n="150">Took their gifts both choice and many ,</l>
       <l n="151">Ate their fruits and wore their flowers 150</l>
       <l n="152">Plucked from bowers</l>
       <l n="153">Where summer ripens at all hours ?</l>
       <l n="154">But ever in the noonlight</l>
       <l n="155">She pined and pined away ;</l>
       <l n="156">Sought them by night and day ,</l>
       <l n="157">Found them no more , but dwindled and grew grey ;</l>
       <l n="158">Then fell with the first snow ,</l>
       <l n="159">While to this day no grass will grow</l>
       <l n="160">Where she lies low :</l>
       <l n="161">I planted daisies there a year ago 160</l>
       <l n="162">That never blow .</l>
       <l n="163">You should not loiter so . ’</l>
       <l n="164">‘ Nay , hush , ’ said Laura :</l>
       <l n="165">‘ Nay , hush , my sister :</l>
       <l n="166">I ate and ate my fill ,</l>
       <l n="167">Yet my mouth waters still ;</l>
       <l n="168">To-morrow night I will</l>
       <l n="169">Buy more : ’ and kissed her :</l>
       <l n="170">‘ Have done with sorrow ;</l>
       <l n="171">I 'll bring you plums to-morrow 170</l>
       <l n="172">Fresh on their mother twigs ,</l>
       <l n="173">Cherries worth getting ;</l>
       <l n="174">You cannot think what figs</l>
       <l n="175">My teeth have met in ,</l>
       <l n="176">What melons icy-cold</l>
       <l n="177">Piled on a dish of gold</l>
       <l n="178">Too huge for me to hold ,</l>
       <l n="179">What peaches with a velvet nap ,</l>
       <l n="180">Pellucid grapes without one seed :</l>
       <l n="181">Odorous indeed must be the mead 180</l>
       <l n="182">Whereon they grow , and pure the wave they drink</l>
       <l n="183">With lilies at the brink ,</l>
       <l n="184">And sugar-sweet their sap . ’</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="185">Golden head by golden head ,</l>
       <l n="186">Like two pigeons in one nest</l>
       <l n="187">Folded in each other 's wings ,</l>
       <l n="188">They lay down in their curtained bed :</l>
       <l n="189">Like two blossoms on one stem ,</l>
       <l n="190">Like two flakes of new-fall'n snow ,</l>
       <l n="191">Like two wands of ivory 190</l>
       <l n="192">Tipped with gold for awful kings .</l>
       <l n="193">Moon and stars gazed in at them ,</l>

       <l n="195">Lumbering owls forbore to fly ,</l>
       <l n="196">Not a bat flapped to and fro</l>
       <l n="197">Round their rest :</l>
       <l n="198">Cheek to cheek and breast to breast</l>
       <l n="199">Locked together in one nest .</l>

       <l n="202">Neat like bees , as sweet and busy ,</l>
       <l n="203">Laura rose with Lizzie :</l>
       <l n="204">Fetched in honey , milked the cows ,</l>
       <l n="205">Aired and set to rights the house ,</l>
       <l n="206">Kneaded cakes of whitest wheat ,</l>
       <l n="207">Cakes for dainty mouths to eat ,</l>
       <l n="208">Next churned butter , whipped up cream ,</l>
       <l n="209">Fed their poultry , sat and sewed ;</l>

       <l n="212">Laura in an absent dream ,</l>
       <l n="213">One content , one sick in part ;</l>

       <l n="216">At length slow evening came :</l>

      <head>MY DREAM</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">Hear now a curious dream I dreamed last night</l>
       <l n="2">Each word whereof is weighed and sifted truth .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="3">I stood beside Euphrates while it swelled</l>
       <l n="4">Like overflowing Jordan in its youth :</l>
       <l n="5">It waxed and coloured sensibly to sight ;</l>
       <l n="6">Till out of myriad pregnant waves there welled</l>
       <l n="7">Young crocodiles , a gaunt blunt-featured crew ,</l>
       <l n="8">Fresh-hatched perhaps and daubed with birthday dew .</l>
       <l n="9">The rest if I should tell , I fear my friend</l>
       <l n="10">My closest friend would deem the facts untrue ; 10</l>
       <l n="11">And therefore it were wisely left untold ;</l>
       <l n="12">Yet if you will , why , hear it to the end .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="13">Each crocodile was girt with massive gold</l>
       <l n="14">And polished stones that with their wearers grew :</l>
       <l n="15">But one there was who waxed beyond the rest ,</l>
       <l n="16">Wore kinglier girdle and a kingly crown ,</l>
       <l n="17">Whilst crowns and orbs and sceptres starred his breast .</l>
       <l n="18">All gleamed compact and green with scale on scale ,</l>
       <l n="19">But special burnishment adorned his mail</l>
       <l n="20">And special terror weighed upon his frown ; 20</l>
       <l n="21">His punier brethren quaked before his tail ,</l>
       <l n="22">Broad as a rafter , potent as a flail .</l>
       <l n="23">So he grew lord and master of his kin :</l>
       <l n="24">But who shall tell the tale of all their woes ?</l>
       <l n="25">An execrable appetite arose ,</l>
       <l n="26">He battened on them , crunched , and sucked them in .</l>
       <l n="27">He knew no law , he feared no binding law ,</l>
       <l n="28">But ground them with inexorable jaw :</l>
       <l n="29">The luscious fat distilled upon his chin ,</l>
       <l n="30">Exuded from his nostrils and his eyes , 30</l>
       <l n="31">While still like hungry death he fed his maw ;</l>
       <l n="32">Till every minor crocodile being dead</l>
       <l n="33">And buried too , himself gorged to the full ,</l>
       <l n="34">He slept with breath oppressed and unstrung claw .</l>
       <l n="35">Oh marvel passing strange which next I saw :</l>
       <l n="36">In sleep he dwindled to the common size ,</l>
       <l n="37">And all the empire faded from his coat .</l>
       <l n="38">Then from far off a wingèd vessel came ,</l>
       <l n="39">Swift as a swallow , subtle as a flame :</l>
       <l n="40">I know not what it bore of freight or host , 40</l>
       <l n="41">But white it was as an avenging ghost .</l>
       <l n="42">It levelled strong Euphrates in its course ;</l>
       <l n="43">Supreme yet weightless as an idle mote</l>
       <l n="44">It seemed to tame the waters without force</l>
       <l n="45">Till not a murmur swelled or billow beat :</l>
       <l n="46">Lo , as the purple shadow swept the sands ,</l>
       <l n="47">The prudent crocodile rose on his feet</l>
       <l n="48">And shed appropriate tears and wrung his hands .</l>

       <l n="62">With piercèd hands whose wounds were made by love ;</l>
       <l n="63">Not what I am , remember what Thou wast</l>
       <l n="64">When darkness hid from Thee Thy heavens above ,</l>
       <l n="65">And sin Thy Father 's Face , while thou didst drink</l>
       <l n="66">The bitter cup of death , didst taste thereof</l>
       <l n="67">For every man ; while Thou wast nigh to sink</l>
       <l n="68">Beneath the intense intolerable rod ,</l>
       <l n="69">Grown sick of love ; not what I am , but think</l>
