    <head>INTRODUCTION</head>
    <p n="1">The father of Frederick Locker Lampson ( or Frederick Locker , according to the name by which he is generally known ) was Edward Hawke Locker , at one time Commissioner of Greenwich Hospital . He is described in the “ Dictionary of National Biography ” as “ a man of varied talents and accomplishments , Fellow of the Royal Society , an excellent artist in water-colour , a charming conversationalist , an esteemed friend of Southey and Scott .” Frederick , the author of “ London Lyrics ,” “ was born ,” Mr Augustine Birrell , his son-in-law , writes in Scribner ’ s Magazine ( January 1896 ) , “ in Greenwich Hospital in 1821 . After divers adventures in various not over well selected schools , and a brief experience of the City and of Somerset House , he became a clerk in the Admiralty , serving under Lord Haddington , Sir James Graham , and Sir Charles Wood . He was twice married — first , to Lady Charlotte Bruce , a daughter of Lord Elgin ( of the Marbles ) ; and secondly , to the only daughter of Sir Curtis Lampson , Bart ., of Rowfant in Sussex .”</p>
    <p n="2">The present volume is Locker ’ s earliest literary venture ; produced , however , at the comparatively mature age of thirty-six . “ In 1857 ,” he says in “ My Confidences ,” “ I published a thin volume — certain sparrow-flights of song , called ‘ London Lyrics .’” Subsequently , about 1860 , Thackeray , who was then editor of the Cornhill Magazine , invited Locker to contribute ; and poems published there and elsewhere were collected and reprinted from time to time , the original title being always retained . Ten editions , besides some selections privately printed , appeared before the poet ’ s death . In almost all something new was added , in all something old was taken away ; so that only eight of the twenty-five pieces composing the early “ thin volume ” survive in the issue of 1893 , and some of these are much altered . It is hoped that readers of Locker ’ s later and more highly finished work will consider a republication of his “ Primitiæ ” justified by the interest which attaches to all beginnings .</p>
    <p n="3">So many people even now confuse minor poetry with bad poetry that it is almost invidious to call a poet minor . Yet there is no doubt that minor poetry can be good in its way , just as major poetry can be good in its way . “ If he [ Locker ] was a minor poet he was at least [ why ‘ at least ’? ] a master of the instrument he touched , which cannot ,” writes Mr Coulson Kernahan in the Nineteenth Century for October 1895 , “ be said of all who would be accounted major .” Locker was not of those , in his own opinion , who would be accounted major . “ My aim ,” he says , “ was humble . I used the ordinary metres and rhymes , the simplest language and ideas , I hope , flavoured with an individuality . I strove . . . not to be flat , and above all , not to be tedious .” It is not necessary to prove by argument and illustration that Locker is a minor poet , nor that he belongs to that honourable company of writers of what we now call “ light verse ”— the masters of which are , after all , among the immortals — Horace and Herrick . His place in that company is not so easy to define . Probably he stands half way between the serious singers — who succeed by virtue of grace and artistic finish , yet lack the touch of passion , the indefinable something that makes greatness — and the bards whose primary object , like Calverley ’ s , is to make the reader laugh . “ He elected ,” says Mr Coulson Kernahan , “ to don the cap and bells when he might have worn the singing robes of the poet ”: a description of one who chose to be a jester when he might have been serious , and hardly applicable to Locker , who is never a professed “ funny man .” Mr Kernahan is far more just when he claims for “ London Lyrics ” a kind of sober gentleness which moves neither to laugh nor to weep : “ his sad scenes may touch us to tender melancholy , but never to tears ; his gay ones to smile , but seldom to laughter .” Locker ’ s Muse is not the Muse of high spirits . He does not start with the intention of jesting . He is the gentle and serious spectator of things which are not the most serious in life — with a sense of the humorous which is not repressible , and which enters into all his reflections , but which he never allows wholly to master him .</p>
    <p n="4">It is really impossible to classify poets on any satisfactory principle . Every good poet is a class by himself . But if the attempt must be made , one may say that the author of “ London Lyrics ” belongs to that school of which the other chief representatives , in English or American literature , have been Praed , Oliver Wendell Holmes , and Mr Austin Dobson . It has always been the fashion to class him with the first named of the trio as a writer of “ occasional verse ” or “ vers de société .” These titles , like other parts of the nomenclature of the poetic art , are not satisfying . Why “ smoothly written verse , where a boudoir decorum is or ought always to be preserved : where sentiment never surges into passion , and where humour never overflows into boisterous merriment ” should be conventionally called “ society verse ,” or “ occasional verse ,” is not very clear . To write “ society verse ” is to be the laureate of the cultured , leisured , pleasure-loving upper classes ; but some poets satisfy the above requirements — Locker himself included — yet certainly do not write exclusively of or for “ Society .” Then again , what is “ occasional ”? Many serious poems are inspired by the transient occasion . But we are not , presumably , to class “ Avenge , O Lord , thy slaughtered saints ” among occasional pieces , nor is Wordsworth ’ s sonnet on London at dawn to be called occasional ; yet the source of it , the fact that the poet happened to be upon Westminster Bridge in the early morning , was transient , not ( apparently ) inherent in the nature of things . However , these names must be accepted as we find them . Here is Locker ’ s own law : “ Occasional verse ,” he says , “ should be short , graceful , refined , and fanciful , not seldom distinguished by chastened sentiment , and often playful . The tone should not be pitched high : it should be terse and idiomatic , and rather in the conversational key ; the rhythm should be crisp and sparkling , and the rhyme frequent and never forced , while the entire poem should be marked by tasteful moderation , high finish , and completeness : for , however trivial the subject-matter may be , indeed , rather in proportion to its triviality , subordination to the rules of composition , and perfection of execution , are of the utmost importance .” Among the enviable versifiers who can satisfy these requirements Praed and Locker both hold a high place . Praed , indeed , is the chief among writers of “ vers de société ,” for not only does his manner conform to the laws laid down by high authorities , but his theme is generally “ Society ” with a capital S. “ Praed ,” says Locker in “ My Confidences ,” “ is the very best of his school : indeed , he has a unique position ; for in his narrower vein of whimsical wit , vernacular banter , and antithetical rhetoric , which may correctly be called vers de société in its most perfected form , and its exactest sense , he has never been equalled .” These phrases hit off Praed very well — if one does not exactly see what “ Society ” has to do with antithetical rhetoric .</p>
    <p n="5">These two poets , so often classed together , are not really very much alike . Both are certainly “ in lighter vein ”; but they differ apparently in temperament , and certainly in method . No one would deny to Praed the gift of humour . But the period in which he wrote was one which admired primarily wit ; and while it would be too much to say that his heart is not in his theme — that he stands detached from it — still , his sympathies are indubitably subordinated to the effort , the successful effort , to bring off a neat point , to make a pun in the right place , to be striking , antithetical , epigrammatic . His verses have the finish , in their way , of Pope ’ s couplet and Ovid ’ s pentameter . His best known and most praised work appeals , primarily , to the taste and the ear : always , perhaps , to the head rather than to the heart . There is something of “ hard brilliance ” in Praed : he writes for effect , he is epideictic . Of course , this is one object of writers of “ society verses ”:</p>
    <p n="6">“ Sole secret to jingle and scan ,”</p>
    <p n="7">as an unduly severe critic says somewhere . One need hardly say that this is not Praed ’ s sole secret : but technique is certainly his strong point .</p>
    <p n="8">“ Where are my friends ? I am alone : No playmate shares my beaker : Some lie beneath the churchyard stone And some — before the Speaker : And some compose a tragedy , And some compose a rondo : And some draw sword for Liberty , And some draw pleas for John Doe .</p>
    <p n="9">Tom Mill was used to blacken eyes Without the fear of sessions : Charles Medlar loathed false quantities As much as false professions : Now Mill keeps order in the land , A magistrate pedantic : And Medlar ’ s feet repose unscanned Beneath the wide Atlantic .”</p>
    <p n="10">This is the art which does not conceal itself . One may not be able to do the trick ; but it is possible to see how the trick is done .</p>
    <p n="11">“ No one ,” says Locker , when speaking of occasional or society verse , “ has fully succeeded who did not possess a certain gift of irony .” That is profoundly true . A would-be writer of light verse who has not an ironical habit of mind had better change his purpose and write an epic . Locker has his full share of the necessary gift . Half gay , half melancholy , always ironical — dissembling most of pain and some of pleasure — he is in certain ways the appropriate spokesman of a society like our own , which is really most natural when most dissembling , or dismissing with a smile , its deeper emotions . There is nothing about Locker which is not natural . As he is , so ( apparently ) does he speak : far more candidly and with more of self-revelation than Praed , more candidly than Mr Austin Dobson , who is apt to veil his personality behind a mask of elegant antiquarianism . But Locker is more artless and naïve ( which qualities are in him not the least inconsistent with irony ) than any modern writer , except , perhaps , R. L. Stevenson now and then ; and with the latter naïveté itself is sometimes an artifice . Mr Brander Matthews rightly lays stress on this aspect of Locker ’ s poetry ; “ individuality and directness of expression ”— that is the true note of “ London Lyrics .” He is far more genuine and spontaneous than Praed . It is difficult and perhaps invidious to compare the two as “ humorists .” It may be that Locker ’ s vein of humour is larger and truer than the earlier poet ’ s . Praed belongs , as has been said , to a period of other men and other manners . Probably he is the wittier of the two ; yet this might be contradicted . Locker ’ s humour has the reflective vein , with a suggestion of pathos , of the great writers who flourished in the early and middle Victorian era . We are perhaps a little out of tune now with the sentiment of the middle of the nineteenth century and perhaps , too , with Praed ’ s “ antithetical rhetoric ”; but Locker ’ s humour can never be quite out of fashion . Readers will always smile ( not laugh ) at “ The Housemaid ” or “ The Pilgrims of Pall Mall ” or the lines “ To my Grandmother ”—</p>
    <p n="12">“ With her bridal-wreath , bouquet , Lace farthingale , and gay Falbala ,— If Romney ’ s touch be true , What a lucky dog were you , Grandpapa !</p>
    <p n="13">. . . . .</p>
    <p n="14">What funny fancy slips From atween these cherry lips ? Whisper me , Fair Sorceress in paint , What canon says I mayn ’ t Marry thee ?”</p>
    <p n="15">But perhaps , for a nutshell ’ s content of whimsical Lockerian humour , the gem which will occur to most is the delightful reminiscence of infancy :</p>
    <p n="16">“ I recollect a nurse call ’ d Ann , Who carried me about the grass , And one fine day a fine young man Came up , and kiss ’ d the pretty Lass : She did not make the least objection ! Thinks I . ‘ Aha ! When I can talk I ’ ll tell Mamma .’ — And that ’ s my earliest recollection .”</p>
    <p n="17">( Locker ’ s “ mottoes ,” of which this is one , often contain his most characteristic lines . ) Praed could no more have written that , or the lines “ To my Grandmother ,” than Locker could have written “ The Vicar .” Both poets have other strings . Praed ’ s more serious vein could win a contemporary reputation : but he would not have been remembered for this alone , after eighty years . In “ At Her Window ,” which Mr Coulson Kernahan rightly calls “ one of the most beautiful love-songs of the century ,” Locker is no longer ironical , but rises to the heights of real passion :</p>
    <p n="18">“ Beating Heart ! we come again Where my Love reposes : This is Mabel ’ s window-pane : These are Mabel ’ s roses .</p>
    <p n="19">. . . . .</p>
    <p n="20">Mabel will be deck ’ d anon , Zoned in bride ’ s apparel ; Happy zone ! Oh hark to yon Passion-shaken carol ! Sing thy song , thou trancèd thrush , Pipe thy best , thy clearest ;— Hush , her lattice moves , O hush — Dearest Mabel !— dearest ” . . .</p>

    <docDate>“ I once tried ,” says Locker in “ My Confidences ,” “ to write like Praed .” The effort was not wholly successful : Locker is weakest where his manner is most Praedian ; and the poet , either realising this , or moulded by the temper of his time , appears to have altered most of the obviously imitative passages . Thus in “ Tempora Mutantur ” the last stanza runs , in<date>1857</date>: “ What brought this wanderer here , and why Was Pamela away ? It might be she had found her grave Or he had found her gay ”;</docDate>
    <docImprint>but the antithetical pun is excised in the<date>1893</date>edition , where the lines are : “ The pilgrim sees an empty chair Where Pamela once sat : It may be she had found her grave , It might be worse than that .” So in “ Bramble-Rise ” “ My bank of early violets Is now a bank of savings ” (“ you mark the paronomasia , play ’ pon words ”? ) does not continue to please the taste of the pun-despising fin-de-siècle public or of Locker himself : the corresponding stanza in the poem as published in<date>1893</date>is purified of such tricks . These alterations are characteristic of Locker ’ s literary method . He was keenly critical of himself —“ never ,” says Mr Birrell , “ could mistake good verses for bad ”— and was therefore always changing and polishing his work , adding here , pruning there . Thus only eight poems from the<date>1857</date>volume form part of the “<settlement>London</settlement>Lyrics ” of<date>1893</date>, and only five of these —“ Bramble-Rise ,” “ Piccadilly ,” “ The Pilgrims of Pall Mall ,” “ Circumstance ,” “ The Widow ’ s Mite ”— have maintained their footing throughout in all intervening editions : the three others are , as it were , “ rusticated ” from the very severely edited selection of<date>1881</date>. The variety of forms under which his verses appear at different periods will probably make the poet ’ s works a happy hunting-ground for the future commentator , who will no doubt assign this “ lay ” ( as he will probably call it ) to Locker , that to Lampson , that again to the Lockeridae or the Lampsonschule . The method is familiar . No one , probably , ever was so careful of the “ limae labor .” “ He took ,” we are told , “ great pains with his verses ,” always aiming at a more perfect finish , with no loss of that naturalness which , as has been said , characterises all his work . According to the saying quoted by Matthew Arnold of Joubert , he “ s ’ inquiétait de perfection .” Perfection , to him , implied an appearance of spontaneity : what looked laboured or artificial must be elaborated till it looked spontaneous — as it was in thought if not altogether in development . His critical sense seems to have grown keener with his interest in the making of verses : “ he was a great student of verse ,” Mr Birrell says , and a student especially of that kind of verse of which he was himself one of the masters . In<date>1867</date>he published the well-known collection “ Lyra Elegantiarum ,” assisted by Mr Kernahan : the preface , written by Locker , contains some excellent rules for “ light verse ,” from which the selections are made . This anthology ranges over the whole field of English poetry , and , like everything else of Locker ’ s , it shows the man . “ Its charm ,” writes the editor ’ s collaborator , “ is entirely of the editor ’ s individuality ”— at least , from his favourites in literature , one may make a very fair guess at some part of his character . So , too , “ Patchwork ”— a kind of scrap-book , a collection of miscellaneous anecdotes , mostly humorous , but not as a rule broadly or farcically funny — illustrates his delicate and subtle perception of the laughable . Locker married Lady Charlotte Bruce in<date>1850</date>, and soon after left the service of Government . Thenceforward he appears to have led a very placid life , happy in his family , seeing much of his large circle of friends , devoted to poetry and book-collecting . “ Lyra Elegantiarum ” was published in<date>1867</date>, “ Patchwork ” in<date>1879</date>. In<date>1886</date>Locker published a catalogue of what he called the “ Rowfant Library ”— his collection of rare and valuable books ( mostly the poetry of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries ) and autographs — of which Mr Andrew Lang has sung : “ The Rowfant books , how fair they shew , The Quarto quaint , the Aldine tall , Print , autograph , portfolio ! Back from the outer air they call The athletes from the Tennis ball , This Rhymer from his rod and hooks , Would I could sing them , one and all , The Rowfant books !” Locker ’ s first wife died in<date>1872</date>. In<date>1874</date>he married Miss Lampson , adding her family name to his own . The rest of his life was spent for the most part at Rowfant : he died there , 30th May<date>1895</date>. His autobiography , “ My Confidences ,” was published posthumously in<date>1896</date>.</docImprint>

    <p n="3">O Tempora Mutantur . Written in 1856 : last published in 1893 : omitted from the 1881 edition . In 1893 the last stanza is different : I have quoted from it in the Introduction .</p>
    <p n="4">Piccadilly . Last published in 1893 . After the words “ If ‘ yes ,’ Piccadilly ,” the 1893 version is as follows :—</p>
    <p n="5">“ From Primrose balcony , long ages ago ‘ Old Q ’ sat at gaze ,— who now passes below ? A frolicsome statesman , the Man of the Day ,” etc .</p>
    <p n="6">The Old Clerk . Written in 1856 : last published in 1893 : omitted in 1881 . The final version ( title , “ The Old Government Clerk ”) is a good deal elaborated , and a stanza added .</p>
    <p n="7">The Garter . Last published in 1878 . In the 1862 and subsequent editions the title is “ Arcadia .”</p>
    <p n="8">Pilgrims of Pall Mall . Written in 1856 : last published in 1893 . The first lines of the fifth stanza run , as finally revised :</p>
    <p n="9">“ I often wander up and down , When morning bathes the silent town In dewy glory ”;</p>
    <p n="10">and the seventh stanza is altered to :</p>
    <p n="11">“ My heart grows chill ! Can Soul like thine , Weary of this clear world of mine , Have loosed its fetter , To find a world whose promised bliss Is better than the best of this ?— And is it better ?”</p>
    <p n="12">These are the most important changes .</p>
    <p n="13">The Russet Pitcher . Last published in 1870 : omitted in 1868 .</p>
    <p n="14">The Enchanted Rose . “ The Fairy Rose ” in subsequent editions . Last published in 1870 : omitted in 1868 .</p>
    <p n="15">Circumstance . Written in 1856 : last published in 1893 , with some alteration . The last line runs , finally : “ And — wish them at the devil .”</p>

    <p n="18">Vanity Fair . Last published in 1878 .</p>
    <p n="19">Bramble-Rise . Written in 1857 : last published in 1893 , a good deal altered . It is less “ Praedian ” than in the original form : the puns in stanzas four and nine disappear .</p>
    <p n="20">Old Letters . Last published in 1878 . Of all the London Lyrics this is the most obviously reminiscent of Praed : and as such it is rejected by Locker ’ s final judgment . It belongs evidently to the period when “ I once tried to write like Praed .”</p>
    <p n="21">Susannah . Last published ( as “ Susan ”) in 1872 : omitted in 1868 . The first verse , slightly altered , serves as “ motto ” for the serious poem , “ Her quiet resting-place is far away ,” which is in some of the later editions .</p>
