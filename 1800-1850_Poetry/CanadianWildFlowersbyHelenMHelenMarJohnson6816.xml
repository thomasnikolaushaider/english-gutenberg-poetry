    <head>PREFACE .</head>
    <p n="1">An observance of the hand of God in his providences , as well as of his Spirit in the written Word and in the human heart , has led to the publication of this book . Though more than twenty years hare passed since Miss JOHNSON died , her name is like “ an ointment poured forth . ” Many who never knew her personally seem to know her well from her poetic writings : for “ as fragrance to the sense of smell , music to the ear , or beauty to the eye , so is poetry to the sensibilities of the heart ,— it ministers to a want of our intellectual nature ; this is the secret of its power and the pledge of its perpetuity . ” A 16mo volume of her “ Poems ” was published in Boston , in 1855 , but has long been out of print . In 1864 the Rev . E. H. Dewart published in Montreal a work entitled “ Selections from Canadian Poets , ” in which ten of her poems were inserted and a very appreciative notice of her given . She also wrote for several papers , so that in various ways her thoughts have been widely disseminated . A desire has often been expressed to have them collected into one volume ; but to have all thus republished would not be best . I have therefore attempted only what the title indicates — to make selections from her writings ; and conclude to send them forth under a name which she herself chose at a time when she had thoughts of getting out a book . Let critics remember that they claim to be only “ Canadian wild flowers ” ; yet we feel sure that some of them , for beauty of form and fragrance of truth , will not unfavorably compare with some of the cultivated productions of our classic poets . Miss JOHNSON was better known by her poetry than by her prose writings , yet in the latter are found so many grand thoughts that I have copied from them freely . The biographical sketch , it is hoped , will add interest to the book , especially as so many of her diary notes have been interwoven . Some of her pieces are here printed for the first time . The prize poem on “ The Surrender of Quebec ” is given in full . In the Preface to her “ Poems ” she said : “ I have been cheered and encouraged by the thought that perhaps through my instrumentality the heart of some humble believer might be comforted , and some wretched wanderer , weary of the vanities of earth , be directed to the only source of life and happiness . Should such be the case , the brightest hopes of the authoress will be fulfilled , and she herself be amply compensated for her care and labor . ” With a sincere desire to aid in the direction thus indicated this little work is now sent forth .</p>

   <p>LIFE SKETCH .</p>
   <p>The hill country of Judea , which furnished a home for the virgin mother of our Lord , is not the only rural region from whence have come women endowed with intelligence and integrity , philanthropy and religion , who by pen and tongue have brightened and blest the hearts and homes of thousands . Nurtured amidst the wilds of nature , instead of the bustle and bewildering attractions of city life , they have grown strong to do battle for the right and to bear testimony to the truth as it is in Jesus . Of this class is the one whose life and labors we are now to consider .</p>
   <p>Memphremagog is an enchanting lake , two-thirds of which lie in the Eastern Townships of Canada , in the Province of Quebec , and the upper third in Vermont . Its extreme length from north to south is about thirty miles , its breadth varying from one to three miles . It is semi-circular in form and bestudded with islands ; while on its western shore rise mountains of no ordinary attractions , among them Owl 's Head , which towers about 2 , 500 feet above the surface of the lake , affording from its summit a panoramic view of surpassing loveliness . It was at “ The Outlet ” of this lake there was born , Oct. 27 , 1834 , Helen Mar , the youngest daughter of Abel B. and Polly JOHNSON ; and there she spent — with the exception of the time devoted to attending or teaching school — almost her entire life . Of cities she knew nothing by experience ; but as her reading was extensive she knew much of the world by mental surveys . The book of Nature was her delight . Its illustrations of stones and streams , lakes and rivers , mountains and forests , birds and flowers , were ever attractive to her . At an early age she began to exhibit rare poetic talent . Of “ a number of short pieces , written between the ages of twelve and fifteen years , ” the following , entitled “ The Forest , ” has been preserved . It appeared in the Stanstead Journal — a paper to which she afterwards frequently contributed . It was probably the first article she ever had printed .</p>

   <p>Her life was not one of thrilling adventure , hairbreadth escapes , and deeds securing worldly applause , but quiet , unobtrusive and useful . Her constitution was naturally weak — her brain too active for her body , and as a consequence much mental and physical suffering was her portion . To her studies — French , Latin and drawing , besides the English branches — she was very devoted . Nothing pleased her better than to be alone with books , pen and pencil , or to wander forth in garden or field . Being of a very bashful and retiring disposition she felt alone even in company . Her diary leaves give evidence of this . Under date of June 19 , 1852 , for example , she writes :</p>
   <p>“ How lonely I feel to-day ! and my rebellious heart will repeat the question , Why was I created thus ? I stand alone , and why ? I know it is my own self that makes me so ; but how can I make myself otherwise ? I have tried very , very hard to overcome my — what shall I call it ? bashfulness ? It seems as though it could not be wholly that . I have seen those the world called bashful , but they were not at all like myself . Oh , no ; I am wretched at times on account of this ——. When I see myself all alone — different from those around me — I cannot stay the burning tear though I would gladly repress it . I cannot soothe the anguish that fills my heart , and yet I feel that this is wrong ,— that it ought not to be thus . Why should I feel so keenly that I am alone ? that I am strange ? Earthly scenes will soon be over , and if I am only a Christian I shall never feel alone in heaven . Oh , glorious thought ! there will be no strange being there . O God , prepare me for that blissful world and I will no longer complain of my loneliness on earth — no longer sigh that I am not like others . ”</p>
   <p>At this time Miss JOHNSON was not a professed Christian . Her parents had endeavored to bring her up in the fear of the Lord and a belief of the gospel , and to attend the services of the sanctuary . Her life had been one of strict morality . She believed in God but had not taken Christ as her own personal Saviour and confessed him before men as she felt she should . Her conviction of sin however was deep and pungent . On another day in the same month , she says :—</p>
   <p>“ O Earth , thou art a lovely place , and some of thy inhabitants are as lovely and happy as thyself . See that beautiful bird , with shining plumage and brilliant crest , and hear the melodious notes that arise from its silvery throat ! Its form proclaims beauty , and its song happiness . See those snow-white lambs skipping over the verdant grass ,— now nestling sportively beside their bleating mothers , then springing forward , bounding from knoll to knoll , and filling the air with strains of joy and delight ! See yonder butterfly weighing itself upon that brilliant flower : his gorgeous wings are expanded and glittering in the sun like sparkling gems ! See those bright-eyed children ! their glowing cheeks , their beaming eyes , and above all their clear and merry laugh proclaiming happiness pure and unbounded . Earth is truly lovely , but its inhabitants are not all happy . Oh no , not all , for one who loves the beauties of earth , rejoices in the loveliness of nature , and finds her chief pleasures in the spreading grove , by the babbling brook , among the brilliant flowers , is sad and unhappy . And why ? Because she has learned too soon that there is no such thing as [ real and abiding ] happiness on earth , that the fairest plants wither , that pleasure is a deceitful phantom-false and fleeting . Truly she has learned all this , and will she never learn to raise her eyes to that bright world where true happiness only resides , and to trust meekly in Him who is the only Dispenser of peace and joy ? ”</p>
   <p>Later we have another entry in which , after again referring to the beauties of nature , she exclaims :</p>
   <p>“ O life , life ! I fain would read thy mysteries : I fain would draw aside every vail and behold for what purpose I was created . Was it to be an heir of sorrow ? was it to live for myself alone , and then pass away and let my memory perish with me ? No , I was born for a better — a higher and more holy purpose . I was not born to pass a few moments on the stage of life and then disappear forever .... With a shudder I turn away and would gladly forget to think . O thought , thought ! thou wilt distract me ,— thou hast almost hurled reason from her throne . Thou bitter tormentor ! depart , if but for a moment , and let me once more find peace . But no ; the more I seek to elude still nearer the demon pursues . O thought , thought ! it rushes forth from my soul like the wild outpourings of the volcanic mountains and overwhelms me with its burning tide till body , mind and soul — all , all are exhausted and lie like a straw upon the roaring bosom of the deep . Oh , that I could arise , mingle with the gay , and forget my own deep and overpowering thoughts . But no ; such thoughts , like the soul which gave them birth , can never die . O thought , what art thou ? A blessing to angels , a curse to me . Distracted soul , sink into repose : others are happy , and wast thou born to be more wretched than they ? Truly thou wast , and why ? Because thou livest only in the regions of thought — thought which is burning my brain and piercing my lacerated heart . And yet a thought freighted with light beams through the dark clouds which its darker sisters have thrown around me , and the only inscription which it bears is , ‘ Live for others . ’ And another thought follows in rapid succession ,— like a far-off echo it repeats the words of its predecessor , ‘ Live for others , ’ and then adds ( while a vivid flash of the lightning of truth lights up the darkness of error ) , ‘ Live for God and for heaven . ’ A loud crash follows . Peals of thunder shake the atmosphere of my soul ! Self has fallen : I will live for others , for God and for heaven . ”</p>
   <p>This was a grand resolve ; but not yet was the soul to be out of prison , the pilgrim to be freed from the Slough of Despond . Once more she has to write :—</p>
   <p>“ Everything is beautiful , and all nature is glad and rejoicing . Arise , my soul , and be thou glad likewise . Cast off thy gloomy fears . The God who made all the beautiful things by which thou art surrounded is not unmindful of thee . Oh , wondrous condescension ! God is not forgetful of me . He gazes upon me with an eye of compassion ; he pities my distress and my weakness . Amazing love ! Oh , that I were more worthy of it ; Oh , that I loved him as fervently as I ought ! But my heart is callous , and I am nothing but a poor , cold , vile and helpless sinner : nothing but sin dwells hi my heart . It is the seat of every vice , every evil thought , and every depraved passion . [ Jer . 17 : 9 , 10 ; Mark 7 : 21-23 ] . Dark and gloomy clouds envelope my soul . A weight of sorrow presses upon my heart , and I vainly strive to free myself from its influence . Everything looks dark . ‘ My God , my God , why hast thou forsaken me ? why art thou so far from helping me ? ’ ‘ How long wilt thou forget me , O Lord ? forever ? How long wilt thou hide thy face from me ? ’ ‘ Mine iniquities are gone over my head : as a heavy burden they are too heavy for me . Lord , all my desire is before thee ; and my groaning is not hid from thee . Make haste to help me . ’ ‘ My soul fainteth for thy salvation , but I hope in thy word . ’ O my God , hear my cry , and answer my petition . ”</p>
   <p>“ Tuesday , June 29 , 1852 . The sultry fires of the day have yielded to the cool breezes of evening . A misty cloud hangs over the once azure sky , and the deep , heavy roar of thunder shakes the quiet air . Nearer and nearer still it rolls its deep-toned voice , and all nature seems to reply . The vivid lightnings flash . The fountains on high are opened , and the rain pours down in torrents . Wilder grows the storm : the winds are released from their ‘ prison-cave , ’ and armed with fury they rush madly forth ; brighter the lightnings glare , louder the thunders roar . The whole fabric of nature seems in commotion ! Oh , who can gaze upon such a scene without emotions of awe , wonder and admiration ? Surely such an one must possess a stony heart and a cold nature . There is beauty for me in the lightning 's glare — there is music in the thunder 's peal ! God grant that there may be beauty and glory for me in the day when the thundering notes of the last trumpet shall shake the heavens and awaken the sleeping dead ,— when ‘ the elements shall melt with fervent heat , ’ and every soul of every tribe , and tongue and nation shall stand before the judgment-seat to receive their final doom ! O grant that the Judge may be my friend , and that I — the poorest , the lowest , the vilest of sinners — may find a seat at his right hand ; and the vaults of heaven shall forever ring with the praises of a redeemed sinner , saved only through the grace and blood of the crucified Saviour . ”</p>
   <p>But the hour was at hand when there was to come such relief to the troubled soul as it had never before experienced ,— when the divine Comforter was to take of the things of Christ and reveal them to the longing heart ,— and this maiden avow herself before the world a disciple of Christ . How was this to be effected ?</p>
   <p>Sunday , July 25 , I had an appointment to preach in Magog , and after the forenoon service expected to baptize a young lady who had been a schoolmate of Miss JOHNSON . In view of that arrangement I urged that they should both go together in the ordinance , but could get no encouragement that it would be so . We went to the church , where I preached from Col. 3 : 1-4 , and after sermon announced the hymn ,—</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ Gracious Lord , incline thine ear ,</l>
     <l n="2">My request vouchsafe to hear ;</l>

     <l n="4">Give me Christ , or else I die .</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">The effect and what followed I will allow her to relate in her own</l>
     <l n="10">words :—</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>“ Oh , the agony and the perfect peace that I have this day enjoyed ! The agony in the morning was almost insupportable . It seemed then utterly impossible for me to take up so heavy a cross as to follow my Saviour in the ordinance of baptism . The very thought was dreadful , and yet I knew that it was my duty . I felt that the anger of God would be kindled against me ,— that his Holy Spirit would not always strive with me . I threw myself upon my knees ; but could find no peace there as long as I continued proudly obstinate . I started from my knees and seized ‘ the holy Book of God ’ ; but there was nothing there to comfort me . I paced the room hurriedly , at every step exclaiming , ‘ What shall I do ? ’ and yet I knew what to do , but would not do it . Thus the morning passed away , and trembling with emotion I entered the house of God . The sermon seemed designed expressly for me . At its close I grew more agitated . The last hymn was read , and after singing we were to repair to the water , where one happy being was to follow her blessed Saviour into a watery grave . Oh , I shall never forget that hymn ,— never , no never . The closing line of each verse seemed as an echo from my own heart , ‘ Give me Christ or else I die ’ ; but as the last line of the last verse fell upon my ear — ‘ Christ is mine . I shall not die , ” — I think that then I did truly feel determined to come boldly forth and claim the precious promises of God as my own .</p>
   <p>“ We sought the water 's side , when Josephine asked me in a trembling voice if I would be baptized . I thought she expected an answer in the negative — at least I knew that she might reasonably expect it , for I had told her plainly in the morning that I could not . My heart was too full to speak : I only bowed my head in token of assent . I shall never forget the look of joy that beamed in her countenance , nor the emotions that filled my own bosom . I saw Eliza enter the water . Oh , glorious sight ! I never saw , never imagined so beautiful a scene . Every fear vanished , every cloud withdrew from my soul , and I longed to enter the waving flood . O my Saviour ! I did not enter it alone . Surely it was nothing short of the almighty arm of God that supported me then . I never in all my life had so little fear of man : I had no fear then . Truly it was a foretaste of heaven . Oh , happy , thrice happy moment ! it was worth a whole lifetime of sorrow . If I could always feel as I did then my heart would never again be bowed down with grief : but that very afternoon Satan began to whisper : ‘ You will not live up to your profession ; you have deceived yourself and others ; you are still a wicked creature ; you are not a Christian ’ ; and yet by the grace of God I was able , in some degree at least , to resist him .</p>
   <p>“ When I partook of the Lord 's supper I felt a repetition of the happiness I had while obeying the command of my Saviour and following him into a watery grave . How vividly the last supper which Christ partook of with his disciples presented itself to my mind ! and then I looked forward with joyful hope to the day when all the saints of God shall eat bread in his glorious kingdom ,— when all of every age and clime shall be gathered around the table , and Jesus Christ himself be in their midst . It was a soul-inspiring thought , and for all the wealth of a thousand worlds like this I would not have been absent from that communion — from which I had so often absented myself . Yes ; I had never before partaken of the Lord 's supper ; and it was my own wicked heart which had kept me away , for God had called loudly upon me , and his Holy Spirit had again and again striven with me . Oh , what a sinner I have been , and what a longsuffering God ! I wonder that he did not cast me off forever . Oh , what mercy I ‘ Bless the Lord , O my soul , and all that is within me bless his holy name . Bless the Lord , O my soul , and forget not all his benefits . ’ And now , have I forsaken all for Christ ? Have I thrown myself — body , soul , and spirit — upon the altar ? I do want to sacrifice everything for Christ , and by the grace of God I will perform the following :—</p>
   <p>“ 1 . When my duty appears plain I will do it , whatever may be the consequences .</p>
   <p>“ 2 . I will never be ashamed to confess Christ before the world .</p>
   <p>“ 3 . I will consecrate my talents entirely to the Lord .</p>
   <p>“ 4 . I will never employ my pen in writing anything which I might regret at the bar of God .</p>
   <p>“ 5 . I will never permit any one of my compositions to be printed unless I can in sincerity ask the blessing of God to attend it .</p>
   <p>“ 6 . As I shall be brought into judgment for every idle word I say , I will endeavor never to engage in trifling conversation , but on every proper occasion to speak of the wondrous grace of God .</p>
   <p>“ 7 . I will , whenever a good opportunity occurs , warn my young companions to flee from the wrath to come .</p>
   <p>“ 8 . I will strive to set my affections on things above , not on things on the earth .</p>
   <p>“ 9 . By the assistance of the Holy Spirit I will endeavor to keep evil thoughts out of my heart , and to meditate upon the law of God .</p>
   <p>“ 10 . I will never pass a day without seeking some secret place at least twice a day , and pouring out my soul in prayer to God .</p>

   <p>“ O God , assist me to perform what I have written in thy fear and to thy glory . I am perfect weakness : but ‘ thou knowest my frame , thou rememberest that I am dust . ’ I know thou art merciful ; Oh , give me a more exalted faith . Help me to come boldly forward and claim thy promises as mine . Humble my pride ; keep me at thy feet ; let not the temptations of Satan overcome me , but may I trust myself in thine arms . May I love thee fervently , above everything else — better , far than my own life . I can do nothing unless thou dost assist me . Oh , support me , and save me at last in thy kingdom , for Christ 's sake . ”</p>
   <p>In the evening of that ever memorable Sabbath she offered aloud a few words of prayer at the family altar , and next day ( as she was then teaching ) had prayer in her school : thus she “ confessed with the mouth the Lord Jesus ” while in her heart she believed that God had raised him from the dead ( Rom . 10 : 9 ) . Immediately after the Son of God himself was baptized , he was in the wilderness “ tempted of the devil ” ; it need not be thought strange therefore if his followers soon after their baptism are also grievously assaulted by the same adversary . This young Christian did not escape him entirely ; yet from that day until her death , though conscious of much weakness and imperfection , having many dark days and great sufferings , she never renounced her allegiance to the King of kings , who had bought her with his blood . A few more selections from her diary will show the working of her mind about this time .</p>
   <p>“ Aug. 7 . A calm and quiet morning . A soothing calm steals over my soul . Faith , with triumphant wing , rises far above , the scenes of earth and points to that glorious world where Christ pleads for me before the throne of his Father . The doubts which have so long filled my heart are sinful and dishonoring to God , and I will no longer give place to them : I will look away from myself — from my sins — to the holy Lamb of God . I will trust wholly in him and in his merits alone for acceptance . ”</p>
   <p>“ Sunday , Aug. 8 . What I have done to-day would once have seemed impossible , the cross that I have taken up would have seemed almost insupportable . I could not have believed the last time I attended the prayer-meeting that at the next one I should stand up as a witness for Christ . But thank God ! my proud heart has in some degree been humbled , and the dearest hope I now cherish is , that Christ may not be ashamed to confess me before his Father and all the holy angels . ”</p>
   <p>“ Aug. 22 . While standing this evening by the grave of one dearly beloved in life , and cherished more fondly now that death has taken her from my embrace , I could not stay the soaring flight of fancy , which would portray to my mind in vivid colors our meeting at the great Resurrection morn ; and the thought that that meeting was so near — that in a very little while the grave should lose its power and that she would come forth robed in immortal beauty , filled my soul with transport and almost brought to my lips the yearning cry , ‘ Come , Lord Jesus , and come quickly . ’ ”</p>
   <p>On the 27th of August Miss JOHNSON closed her school , and after spending a few weeks at home went to the academy at Derby Centre , Vt . Under date of “ Wednesday , Oct. 26 , ” we have this entry in her journal :—</p>
   <p>“ Attended the exercises to-night and read a composition . They could not have liked it , for it was upon a subject which must be disagreeable to the world ; and yet it is the subject nearest my heart — one that I love to dwell upon and to hear about : the coming of my blessed Saviour . When will the glorious morn appear ! Loud and repeated cheers were given when Miss —— read her composition . Well , it was good ; such as would suit the world , but not me — strange being that I am . But I shall not always be so : in heaven I shall not be a stranger . There I can converse with the saints dearly-beloved : for their conversation will be on the things of God ; and my Saviour himself will deign to address me there ! Why should I not then long , aye long to obtain that blissful state ? And yet I sometimes fear that I shall fall far short of it , for I am so vile and polluted . ”</p>
   <p>The “ composition ” referred to we do not find among her papers ; but much that she has written shows that she was indeed deeply interested in “ that blessed hope ” ( Tit . 2 : 13 ) . She was a decided pre - millennialist , and stood identified in her church-membership with the Evangelical Adventists . On completing her eighteenth year ( Oct. 27 , 1852 ) , she said :—</p>
   <p>“ This evening , while looking back through all the events of my life , what is there that rejoices me most ? It is one that the past year has brought forth ,— one that will ever be remembered with deep and powerful emotions : the day that consecrated me to the Lord , when I breathed forth with a fervent heart , ‘ Give me Christ , or else I die , ’ and I was enabled to take up my cross and follow my Saviour in baptism . ”</p>
   <p>Here there is no regret expressed for the step she had taken , nor did she ever feel any , though she greatly deplored her weakness and unprofitableness in the Lord 's service . And why not ? Listen to her , under date of June 13 , 1853 :—</p>
   <p>“ How sweet , when the soul has no earthly support , to fly to the Rock of Ages ! The Saviour is precious to the heart of the pardoned sinner . There is nothing like the love of Jesus . He is not like other friends — oftentimes wearied by our complaints and the repetition of our sorrows , but is always longsuffering and delighting to hear and answer every cry of the burdened spirit ; smiling ever in the darkest of afflictions , and forever dropping the balm of consolation into the distracted breast . Oh , what a privilege to have such a friend — such a sure and steadfast friend — such a wise and omnipotent friend . And he is my friend ? Yes ; he is ‘ the sinner 's FRIEND , ’ and therefore mine : for surely nothing but wondrous love could have led him to die a cruel and ignominious death for me , polluted as I am . O Jesus , thou art my friend and I will be thy friend ; thou didst love me first and I do love thee , but not as fervently as I should , nor so much as I desire . O God , give me more of thy Holy Spirit ; may it consume every unhallowed passion , tear every idol from my heart , and consecrate that heart entirely to thee . ”</p>
   <p>The only journal notes of considerable length which Miss JOHNSON seems to have made were for the years 1852 and 1853 . Those for 1855 and 1860 were entered in a “ daily miniature diary . ” We find none for other years , though she always kept her pen and pencil busy in some way as long as she had strength to write . The diary for 1855 is in rhyme — usually six lines being allotted to each day . While some of the verses are playful and witty , most of them are religious and plaintive . The following are given as specimens :</p>

   <p>In the fall of 1856 Miss JOHNSON was prostrated by disease , and nearly all the time afterwards confined to the house . So numerous and complicated were her difficulties as to baffle the skill of all the physicians who saw her , and no one knows the amount of suffering she endured . Her mind however was active and vigorous , and though there were seasons — sometimes quite protracted — when to her the heavens above seemed as brass and the earth iron , yet God did not forsake her : the sunshine succeeded the storm , and the peace that Jesus gives — was poured into her wounded heart . Referring to her afflictions in 1858 and the two following years she writes :—</p>
   <p>“ Those were days and nights of anguish , but I now look back to them with feelings of regret , for my feet had only touched the dark waters and my lips had only tasted the cup from which I was to drink the very dregs . Early in the spring of 1858 I was seized with fever and acute inflammation of the stomach , which brought me to the verge of the grave . I could feel the warm tears of beloved ones upon my cheeks , as they bent tenderly over me ; I could see the dark vale just ahead ( though there was a light amid the darkness ) , but my sufferings were not to be so soon terminated . Gradually my disease assumed a chronic form , and physicians said there was no hope . The little nourishment I could take distressed me so , terribly that the very thought of eating made me shudder , and my stomach became so sore that I could not be moved from one side of the bed to the other without uttering a cry of pain . Winter , spring , summer and autumn in turn visited the earth , and with each I thought , aye , longed to depart ; but the great Refiner had his own purpose to accomplish ,— there was a little fine gold but the dross rendered it useless . The ordeal through which I am passing is indeed a terrible one , but I know where peace and consolation are to be found , and there are times when I can say in sincerity , ‘ Thy will be done . ’ ”</p>
   <p>Thursday , Jan. 1 , 1863 , she wrote :—</p>
   <p>“ Bright , beautiful day . Many people on the ice . Edwin [ her brother ] there . Over our dwelling is a shadow ; it falls upon our spirits and we are sad . Will it never be removed ? God grant we may be patient and grateful for the blessings we do enjoy , for are not friends — true , tender friends , the greatest and holiest of blessings ? and while we have them God forgive us for murmuring at his dealings . ”</p>
   <p>The last entries in her diary are : “ Feb. 2 . Very sick ” ; “ Tuesday , 3rd . No better . ” It is uncertain when the following lines were written , but it might have been about this time :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ I 'm going home to that bright land of rest</l>
     <l n="2">Where pain and grief and sickness are unknown ;</l>
     <l n="3">The year begins in sorrow , but will close</l>
     <l n="4">In joys that never end — I 'm going home !</l>
     <l n="5">Last year the warning came on sunken eye</l>
     <l n="6">And wasted cheek . I gazed and thought to spend</l>
     <l n="7">My Christmas with the angels . God knows best ;</l>
     <l n="8">And here I linger , weary sufferer still .</l>
     <l n="9">The morning comes long watched-for , long desired ;</l>
     <l n="10">The day drags on , and then the sleepless night :</l>
     <l n="11">But this will have an end — it must be soon . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>About six weeks before her death she was taken with nausea and vomiting : everything she took distressed her , and for the last twenty-three days she took no nourishment save what water contains . Her prayer —</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Close to the Cross , close to the Cross . God grant I may be found</l>
     <l n="2">When death shall call my spirit hence , or the last trumpet sound , ” —</l>
   </lg>
   <p>was indeed answered . Her end was very peaceful and happy . For several weeks not a cloud seemed to pass over her mind ; and though often in great distress there was no impatience manifested , nor did a murmur escape her lips . She said , “ It is nothing to die : ‘ the sting of death is sin , ’ and when sin is taken away the sting is gone . ” On another occasion she remarked : “ I have often heard the words sung —</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">‘ Jesus can make a dying bed</l>
     <l n="2">Feel soft as downy pillows are ’ —</l>
   </lg>
   <p>and thought they were not strictly true ; but now I know that they are perfectly , perfectly so . ” Once as we stood by her bedside she observed her mother and sister weeping , and with a countenance beaming with joy ( sufficient to remind us of 1 Pet . 1 : 8 ) she expressed surprise , remarking : “ It seems to me I am only crossing a narrow brook , and as I look back I see you all coming — we shall soon meet . ” Her view of her own weakness and sinfulness was indeed clear , but she had such unwavering faith in her Redeemer as enabled her to say : “ Dying seems to me like laying the head back and closing the eyes , just to open them in a few moments on the joys of paradise . ” The following lines , written with a pencil on the cover and blank leaf of her French Testament , were the last she ever wrote . They are dated March 3 — just ten days before her death — and give indubitable evidence of the clearness of her intellect and the strength of her faith while passing through “ the valley of the shadow of death ":—</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ Jesus , I know thou art the living Word !</l>
     <l n="2">Each blessed promise to myself I take ;</l>
     <l n="3">I would not doubt , if I had only heard</l>
     <l n="4">This — this alone , ‘ I never will forsake ! ’</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">I have no fear-the sting of death is sin ,</l>
     <l n="6">And Christ removed it when he died for me :</l>
     <l n="7">Washed in his blood , my robe without , within ,</l>
     <l n="8">Has not a stain that God himself can see .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">Wrapped in the Saviour 's arms I sweetly lie ;</l>
     <l n="10">Far , far behind I hear the breakers roar ;</l>
     <l n="11">I have been dying — but I cease to die ,</l>
     <l n="12">My rest begins — rejoice forevermore ! ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Having expressed a wish to be visited by all her acquaintances , many called to see her , with whom she conversed freely on the interests of their soul . With great composure she made arrangements for her departure — leaving books and other articles to her intimate friends . One day she made a request that I should preach her funeral sermon . For a moment I hesitated because of relationship ( having married her sister Josephine ) , then remarked , that I supposed there would be no impropriety in doing so , as I recollected that Whitefield preached his wife 's , to which she immediately added , “ And Wesley preached his mother 's . ” On asking if she had thought of any passage to be used as a text , she replied : “ I first thought of the words , ‘ I shall be satisfied , when I awake , with thy likeness ’ ; but you know that is all about I , and now I feel that Christ is all — it is all Christ : so I have thought of his words in the 11th of John , ‘ I am the Resurrection and the Life . ’ ” She also suggested to her sister that the following hymns ( which were favorites with her ) should be used on the occasion :</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ Come let us join our cheerful songs</l>
     <l n="2">With angels round the throne ; ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">“ On Jordan 's stormy banks I stand</l>
     <l n="4">And cast a wishful eye , ” —</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="5">“ Joyfully , joyfully , onward I move ,</l>
     <l n="6">Bound for the land of bright glory and love . ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>The joyous character of the hymns will at once be noted ; and this was the very reason why she selected them : she considered that they would be more expressive of her condition than the mournful ones which are so frequently used at funerals . Two of her poems seem so appropriate here that we insert them . The former was written in June , 1859 , and the latter bears date “ Nov. 30 , 1861 ":—</p>

   <p>The expected hour though long of coming arrived at last . As long as she seemed to realize what was transpiring around her , and when too weak to converse , she would signify by a word or motion that she had peace and all was well . About a quarter past 11 o'clock Friday night , March 13 , 1863 , “ the silver cord was loosed , ” and she sweetly fell asleep in Jesus , aged twenty-eight years , four months , and sixteen days . On the Tuesday following we buried her from the village church , where ten years before she had decided to come out openly on the Lord 's side . It was crowded . Three ministers , from as many different denominations , assisted me in the services . Her mother and sister ( the wife of Dr. G. O. Somers ) were too feeble to attend . But we hope soon to greet her where — to use her own words ,</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Earthly love is like the starlight lost</l>
     <l n="2">In glorious sunshine , and the things of time</l>
     <l n="3">Shrink into nothing : even death itself</l>
     <l n="4">Fades like a shadow in the noontide blaze ,</l>
     <l n="5">And life — new , glorious , everlasting life —</l>
     <l n="6">Expands the soul , and all it ever dreamed</l>
     <l n="7">Of heavenly bliss becomes reality . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Above the stillness of death we hear the words of inspiration : “ Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints ” ; “ Thy dead shall live again ” ; and in hope we wait . The weary pilgrim has reached her resting-place . She lies in the chamber of Peace , whose windows open toward the sunrising .</p>

    <head>AN EVENING MEDITATION .</head>
    <head>How softly yonder pale star beams above my head to-night ! How beautiful it appears in the azure vault of heaven where twilight holds the connecting link between day and night . Oh , if my soul were freed from its clayey fetters how swiftly it would fly ( if such a journey were possible ) to the boundaries of that sweet star ! Can that fair planet , seemingly so pure and spotless , be inhabited by beings as frail and erring as ourselves ? Can there be any sad souls there to - night — any who are weeping over blighted hopes and blasted prospects ? It may be so ; and yet perchance such a thing as a pang of sorrow and a burning tear are unknown , for it may be sin has never entered there . Vain , useless conjectures ! But will the veil which hides the scenes of other worlds from our eyes never be withdrawn ? ... Surely it is because God is merciful that I have been spared through another day . I cannot forbear wondering that I have been spared so long ,— that I have not been cut down as a cumberer of the ground . O God , according to thy loving-kindness preserve me . Grant that I may yet be an humble instrument in thy hand of doing something for the good of thy cause . Forgive my numberless sins and at last receive me to glory .— July 20 , 1852 .</head>

   <p>THE FADING AND THE UNFADING .</p>
   <p>Once more the beautiful Spring has returned , and from my window I can behold the delightful places where I have so often roamed in childhood light-hearted and happy . But the lovely Spring brings no longer the same emotions as of yore . Oh no ! for “ a change has come over the spirit of my dream . ” Earth has lost its charms , and although I love the beauties of nature even better than before , still they cannot satisfy ,— they are doomed to fade , and my soul yearns for those beautiful heavenly bowers which shall never wither ; where God himself reigns in person and “ chases night away . ” But , although I sigh for such things , am I prepared for them ? Should I be ready at this moment to enter the paradise of God ? Ah , my heart , why shouldest thou hesitate thus to return an answer ? God is still able and willing to save , and though I have wandered so far from Him , if with an humble and penitent soul I confess my sins he is willing and able to forgive me .— June 4 , 1853 .</p>

   <p>AUTUMN TEACHINGS .</p>
   <p>The howling winds rage around my casement . The summer is past , and everything indicates that winter will soon be here . The seared leaves are falling from their homes in the waving forests ; the earth has thrown aside her gay mantle of green , and one scene of desolation presents itself to the eye . The decay of nature brings with it sad and solemn reflections , how much more the decay of the human form — of which autumn seems so striking an emblem . The days of man are few . Like the flower of the field he perisheth , and yet how few seem to realize it ! O God , teach me to apply my heart unto wisdom . Help me to love and serve thee , that when “ the heavens shall be dissolved and the elements shall melt with fervent heat ” I may not be among those who shall take up the sad lamentation : “ The harvest is past , the summer is ended , and we are not saved . ” — Oct ., 1852 .</p>

    <head>THE WATCHER .</head>
    <note>As Miss Johnson lived in the house with Dr. G. O. Somers , who would frequently in winter cross lake Memphremagog on the ice in visiting his patients , the following , written on a sick-bed , gives a graphic description of what her fears pictured might be a reality .</note>
     <l n="1">Night comes , but he comes not ! I fear</l>

     <l n="7">A cry for aid ? My God protect !</l>
     <l n="8">Preserve his life — his course direct !</l>
     <l n="9">How suddenly it has grown dark —</l>

     <l n="18">How long he kept his bosom warm</l>
     <l n="19">With thoughts of home , how long he cheered</l>
     <l n="20">His weary horse that plunged , and reared ,</l>

    <note>Quebec is the oldest city in Canada , having been founded by Champlain , in 1608 , near the site of an Indian village . It was taken from the French , by the English , under General Wolfe , in 1759 , after a heroic defence by Montcalm . Both generals fell on the battle-field , mortally wounded . In 1853 the Literary and Historical Society of Quebec offered a prize medal for the best poem relating to the history of Canada . Miss Johnson ( then in her eighteenth year ) wrote the following , which took the prize .</note>

     <l n="1">The orb of day upon his pathway pressed ,</l>
     <l n="2">Beaming with splendor , toward the shining west ,</l>
     <l n="3">Cast one long , lingering glance upon the scene ,</l>
     <l n="4">Lit up the river and the forest green ,</l>
     <l n="5">Left his last rays upon the lordly dome ,</l>
     <l n="6">And deigned to smile upon the peasant 's home ;</l>
     <l n="7">Then ‘ neath the western hills he sought repose ,</l>
     <l n="8">And sank to rest as calmly as he rose :</l>
     <l n="9">Bright at the dawn of day , but brighter now ,</l>
     <l n="10">When day had almost passed , and round her brow</l>
     <l n="11">Hung the expiring beams of dazzling light ,</l>
     <l n="12">The certain presage of approaching night .</l>
     <l n="13">Slowly his gorgeous train , like him , withdrew ,</l>
     <l n="14">Changing as they advanced in form and hue ,</l>
     <l n="15">Until one lovely tint of fairest dye</l>
     <l n="16">Stole softly o'er the calm and cloudless sky ;</l>
     <l n="17">Day , gently smiling , left her gleaming throne ,</l>
     <l n="18">And evening fair came forth , and reigned alone .</l>
     <l n="19">The twinkling stars the azure vault adorned ;</l>
     <l n="20">Like glistening gems , a glorious crown they formed ,</l>
     <l n="21">And proudly sat in splendor pure and bright</l>
     <l n="22">Upon the pale and pensive brow of night ;</l>
     <l n="23">While in the midst of all , with tranquil mien ,</l>
     <l n="24">Mild Cynthia lent enchantment to the scene .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="25">Beneath lay spreading pastures green and fair ,</l>
     <l n="26">And lofty hills and waving forests , where</l>
     <l n="27">The human voice had never yet been heard ,</l>
     <l n="28">Or other sound , save when the depths were stirred</l>
     <l n="29">By the loud screams of some lone midnight bird .</l>
     <l n="30">But high o'er all the lofty city rose ,</l>
     <l n="31">Firm in its strength , sublime in its repose ;</l>
     <l n="32">On every hand by nature fortified ,</l>
     <l n="33">And strongly built ; with air of conscious pride</l>
     <l n="34">Gazed from its heights upon the scene below ,</l>
     <l n="35">And bade defiance to each lurking foe ;</l>
     <l n="36">Confiding in its bulwarks firm and sure ,</l>
     <l n="37">It calmly slept and deemed itself secure !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="38">The river swept along ; with surging roar</l>
     <l n="39">Its waves dashed wildly on the rocky shore ;</l>
     <l n="40">While on its broad , expansive bosom lay</l>
     <l n="41">The twinkling orbs in beautiful array ;</l>
     <l n="42">And every pearly drop shone clear and bright ,</l>
     <l n="43">Bathed in a flood of soft and silvery light .</l>
     <l n="44">Scarcely a ripple stirred its quiet breast ;</l>
     <l n="45">For every sighing breeze was lulled to rest ,</l>
     <l n="46">And every sound was hushed on earth , in air ,</l>
     <l n="47">And silence held supreme dominion there .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="48">Sleep sent his angels forth ; with silent tread ,</l>
     <l n="49">From house to house , they on their mission sped ;</l>
     <l n="50">Watched by the couch of suffering and pain .</l>
     <l n="51">Soothed the pale brow and calmed the throbbing brain ,</l>
     <l n="52">Eased the sad heart and closed the weeping eye ,</l>
     <l n="53">Bade care and grief with their attendants fly ,</l>
     <l n="54">Entered the chamber of the rich and great ,</l>
     <l n="55">Nor scorned to visit those of mean estate ,</l>
     <l n="56">But blessed alike the lofty and the low ,</l>
     <l n="57">Alike bade each forget their weight of woe .</l>
     <l n="58">The proud and wealthy drew around their breast</l>
     <l n="59">“ The curtains of repose , ” and sank to rest ;</l>
     <l n="60">The pallid sons of want and hunger slept ,</l>
     <l n="61">And sorrow 's sons forgot that they had wept .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="62">The night wore slowly on ; the dismal tower</l>
     <l n="63">Had long since tolled the lonely midnight hour</l>
     <l n="64">When a proud band , by daring impulse led ,</l>
     <l n="65">Approached the river with a cautious tread ,</l>
     <l n="66">With kindling eye and with an eager air ,</l>
     <l n="67">Unmoored the boats that waited for them there ;</l>
     <l n="68">In silence left the calm and peaceful shore ,</l>
     <l n="69">In sullen silence plied the hasty oar ,</l>
     <l n="70">In silence passed adown the quiet stream ,</l>
     <l n="71">While ever and anon a pale moonbeam ,</l>
     <l n="72">Sad and reproachful , cast a hasty glance</l>
     <l n="73">On polished dagger and on gleaming lance .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="74">The scene was mournful , and with magic art</l>
     <l n="75">It acted strangely on each manly heart ;</l>
     <l n="76">No speedy action now , no rude alarm ,</l>
     <l n="77">Called forth their powers , or nerved the stalwart arm ;</l>
     <l n="78">No present danger used its strong control ,</l>
     <l n="79">To rouse the passions of the warrior 's soul ;</l>
     <l n="80">But all conspired to place Thought on her throne ,</l>
     <l n="81">And yield the reins of power to her alone .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="82">The past came slowly forth with all its train</l>
     <l n="83">Of blissful scenes that ne'er might be again ,</l>
     <l n="84">Of mournful partings and convulsive sighs ,</l>
     <l n="85">Of pallid faces and of tearful eyes ,</l>
     <l n="86">Of aching hearts that heaved with sorrow 's swell ,</l>
     <l n="87">And broken tones that sadly breathed , “ Farewell ! ”</l>
     <l n="88">And in the silence of that lonely hour ,</l>
     <l n="89">Which bade the sternest own its wondrous power ,</l>
     <l n="90">A small , still voice whispered in every soul ,</l>
     <l n="91">Although each sought to burst from its control :</l>
     <l n="92">“ To-morrow night the moon , as fair as now ,</l>
     <l n="93">May shed her beams upon your death-sealed brow !</l>
     <l n="94">To-morrow night the stars may gild the wave</l>
     <l n="95">While you , perchance , may fill a soldier 's grave !</l>
     <l n="96">To-morrow night your spirit may explore</l>
     <l n="97">The boundless regions of an unknown shore !</l>
     <l n="98">To-morrow night may find you with the slain ,</l>
     <l n="99">And weeping love watch your return in vain ! ”</l>

     <l n="100">And yet not long such gloomy thoughts might rest</l>
     <l n="101">Within the soldier 's brave and gallant breast ;</l>

   <p>OUR NATIVE LAND .</p>
   <note>This was probably written in the early part of the year 1861 , before Lincoln 's Emancipation Proclamation had given deliverance to the captives , and when “ the north star ” was an object dear to many a slave who longed to breathe the free air of Canada . The Rev . E. H. Dewart says of it : “ This spirited lyric is alike creditable to the talents , patriotism , and independence of its author . Its loyalty is an intelligent attainment , free from blind prejudice and crouching adulation . ”</note>

    <head>THE APPEAL .</head>
    <note>It will be remembered that 1861 closed with an alarming prospect of war between England and the United States , growing partly out of the arrest of Mason and Slidell on board the British steamship Trent . Of course had war been declared Canada would have been involved . On Christmas of that year therefore Miss JOHNSON wrote this appeal , which was published in a Canadian paper .</note>

    <head>THE WORLD TO COME .</head>
    <note>Dear as Canada was to our authoress , dearer still to her heart was the true Father-Land , “ the heavenly country ” for which the children of faith in the olden time looked . Being born again she bore such a relationship to the world to come that we may say of her , as she does of “ the bride of Christ ": “ The Cross was infinitely dearer to her than ten thousand worlds . It was twined around her heart with ties that nothing could ever loose . She wept , but they were mingled tears of joy and sorrow : sorrow , for she mourned that her sins had cost the life of the Son of God ; joy , for she knew that that sacrifice had made a perfect atonement for her . She knew that the Father had forgiven her iniquities , and that he would no longer remember her sins . As she clung to the Cross , a bright beam of glory shone around her ; she raised her tearful eyes , and a crown of everlasting beauty met her admiring gaze : she knew that crown was reserved for her , and that on her bridal day her Lord would place it on her own brow . ” With such an experience and such a hope , we are not surprised that she should thus discourse :</note>

    <note>Whether the following is a real or a supposed case we know that in this fallen world of ours there have been many sadder scenes than the one depicted ; for “ who hath woe ? who hath sorrow ? who hath contentions ? who hath babbling ? Who hath wounds without cause ? who hath redness of eyes ? They that tarry long at the wine ; they that go to seek mixed wine .... At the last it biteth like a serpent , and stingeth like an adder . ” — Prov . 23 : 29-35 .</note>

      <l n="1">All day the snow came silently to earth ,</l>
      <l n="2">Until the branches of the apple trees</l>
      <l n="3">Bent lower than in autumn ‘ neath their weight</l>
      <l n="4">Of glossy fruit : the youthful pines that stood ,</l>
      <l n="5">With leafless beech and maple interspersed ,</l>
      <l n="6">To speak of summer when all else that laughed</l>
      <l n="7">In balmy air with summer should depart ,</l>
      <l n="8">Were robed in white , save where some little twig</l>
      <l n="9">Of deepest verdure timidly looked forth ,</l>
      <l n="10">Like gentle Spring reclining in the arms</l>
      <l n="11">Of stern old Winter . Silence reigned abroad ;</l>

      <l n="44">And swept along in one continuous roar .</l>
      <l n="45">They caught the snow new-fallen from the earth</l>
      <l n="46">And wove a sheet with which to blind the eyes</l>
      <l n="47">Of those two wanderers on the frozen waste .</l>

      <l n="52">Was now a path no more ; yet had his brain</l>
      <l n="53">Been clear as on the morn , his step as firm ,</l>
      <l n="54">The father might have found his homeward way .</l>
      <l n="55">But oft the earth seemed reeling ‘ neath his feet ,</l>

      <l n="61">And drops of dew stole from his anxious eyes</l>
      <l n="62">And turned to pearly ice-drops where they fell .</l>
      <l n="63">And then the father took the patient boy</l>
      <l n="64">Within his arms ; he hugged him to his breast</l>
      <l n="65">And tried with steady gaze to pierce the gloom</l>
      <l n="66">If he might catch a glimpse of friendly lights ,</l>
      <l n="67">Or haply of the lamp that burned for him</l>
      <l n="68">In his own cottage , fed by one who watched ,</l>
      <l n="69">And wept , and prayed , and turned the cottage door</l>
      <l n="70">Upon its frosty hinges , till her fair cheek</l>
      <l n="71">Grew purple with the cold ; he thought of this ,</l>
      <l n="72">And anguish and remorse smote heavily .</l>
      <l n="73">But deeper grew the night ; and hours that seemed</l>
      <l n="74">Like years to that distracted father passed .</l>
      <l n="75">Nearer and nearer to his aching breast</l>
      <l n="76">He held the child — for hope grew faint within ;</l>
      <l n="77">Yet with that precious burden at his heart</l>
      <l n="78">He could not quite despair . “ If I have sinned ,</l>

      <l n="82">Guard him , ye angels ! Save him , O my God ! ”</l>
      <l n="83">Thus in the depths of his own soul he prayed ,</l>

   <p>ON SEEING A SKULL</p>
   <p>This morning while examining a skull strange emotions took possession of me — such as I never before experienced . That senseless skull had once been the seat of deep thought and powerful passions ; beaming eyes once glistened brightly where now there was only a hollow space ; that head was once proudly erected , and the form that supported it once mingled in the busy scenes of life . But now what a change ! His very name is forgotten — himself but a handful of dust . O mortals ! behold , and learn a lesson . His body has long since mouldered away and mingled with the parent earth ,— this skull alone remains ; and yet the time will surely come , and cannot be far distant , when “ the bones shall come together — bone to his bone ” ; when the sinews and the flesh shall come upon them , the skin cover them , and the breath entering the body the dead shall live ! Will this skull come forward at “ the resurrection of the just , ” or ——? Oh , what an awful thought ! My very blood runs cold , and a shudder steals over me . O thou great Mediator of mankind , intercede for me before thy Father 's throne , that ere it is everlastingly too late my unworthy name may be written in the Lamb 's book of life .

   <p>ON THE DEATH OF A FRIEND .</p>
   <p>She sleeps the quiet sleep of death and I survive . But for what purpose ? why was not I called first to explore the untried regions of eternity ? ‘ Tis known only to Him whose mighty arm often spares the humble flower while the waving trees that stand around it are torn from their roots by the roaring tempest . She has gone before me , and yet how long may it be ere I shall follow her ? O solemn thought !— well might it sink deeply into my heart , and taking root there spring forth yielding fruits of repentance . Soon may Death , the great enemy of mankind , add one more ghastly victim to the lifeless piles that lie heaped together in every clime and on every shore ; and when my death - knell shall sound will it be the signal of a spirit wailing in the regions of the lost , or rejoicing in the bright realms of everlasting bliss ? It is for me , and me alone to decide . Perhaps it is for this that my life has been spared — that I might make a firm and decided choice ; and shall I still draw back ? shall I still hesitate and remain inactive ? No , no ; for “ now is the accepted time , and now is the day of salvation . ”</p>

How I shall fold my hands upon the bosom that shall never again be troubled , and say in all sincerity : I thank thee , O God , for the sweet that was mingled in my earthly cup , but more do I thank thee for the bitter .</p>

   <p>THE MIXED CUP .</p>
   <p>Joy and sorrow , are they not mingled in every cup ? We call some happy , others unfortunate ; and so they appear to us . But could we draw aside the curtain that conceals the mysteries of the human heart what problems would be solved , and how often we should be lead to exclaim , “ God dealeth justly : pain and pleasure are more equally distributed than we imagined ” ! But this may not be . We judge according to appearances , and this is one great source of misery ; for , in our grief , we imagine others are more favored than we , and for the blessings we do enjoy we are not thankful . Oh , the great mercy of God ! What a wonder it is that he does not smite us to the earth when we dare murmur at his dealings !</p>

   <p>A VOICE FROM A SICK-ROOM .</p>
   <note>At one time Miss Johnson seems to have entertained the idea of writing for publication a series of articles entitled “ Voices from a Sick-room . ” Whether she ever wrote more than one or not I cannot say . The following is the only one we can find among her manuscripts , and it is so thrillingly interesting as to make us wish for more . It is dated Sept. 5 , 1859 .</note>
   <p>Draw the curtains — shut out the light of heaven ; the inner world is so full of darkness that the sunshine of the outer world becomes painful by contrast . Hush , little bird ! do n't sing to-day . There — all is dark and still . Now , O wretched heart , exult in thy wretchedness ; draw the dark , heavy curtains of despair around thee ; shut out the light of hope and love ; hush the voice of praise and thanksgiving . Think of all thou hast suffered ; think of thy present misery ; crowd the future with black-robed phantoms ; people every nook and corner with horrible faces , and over all let the thunder crash and bellow , and the winds moan and shriek , as they moan and shriek only when the great are dying .</p>
   <p>Ah , what sad havoc do sickness and pain make of the poor body ; but sadder still when they trample on the bright inhabitant within , and make it a slave to tremble at their bidding ! “ Bring chains — bring chains , ” cries the fell destroyer ; and ere she has time to rally her forces around her , or even think of resistance , the poor Soul has become a helpless captive , and Disease wears a smile of triumph upon her ghastly cheek , and again lifts up her voice to shout “ victory . ” And a complete victory it is : Self-control , Pride , Ambition — all are humbled ; Hope is shrouded in sackcloth , and if she ever speaks it is only to whisper : “ There is one secret passage by which thou mayest yet escape , but it winds through the kingdom of Death and the Grave . ” Reason herself grows pale and trembles , lest she lose her throne ; for the thousands of obedient servants , which have never before disputed her authority , are all up in arms against her . Every nerve begins to quiver and vibrate ; the whole body is in commotion ; and no wonder the trembling Soul sits down amid the ruins of her former self and makes the whole place doleful with her cries and lamentations .</p>
   <p>Do n't chide her : she is no criminal waiting the demands of justice , but a prisoner of war , and therefore should be dealt kindly with . Do n't gaze at her through her prison bars , as though she were a wild beast caged , or some curious object kept only for a show ; but go to her enveloped in the mantle of love , upon your lips the honey-dew of human kindness , and in your heart the melting tenderness of Christian affection . Do n't tell her she is escaping many trials and temptations to which she would be exposed if she came in contact with the busy world around her . Go to the imprisoned eagle , and , as he looks up longingly into the deep blue sky and beats his wings in agony , comfort him with the assurance that his wants are provided for , and he himself safe from the arts of the fowler ! Aye , tell this to the free-born eagle , but disgust not the ever-yearning , restless Soul with such mockeries . She may listen , but she laughs you to scorn in secret and prays Heaven to be delivered from such comforters . She knows her struggles and temptations are inward ; and she knows too , for that very reason , they are more terrible . There greater battles have been fought than the blood-dyed fields of Europe ever witnessed . Magentas and Solferinas fatten with the blood of heroes , but she carries on a never ending warfare “ with principalities and powers ” — the numberless host of hell — and legions of native passions .</p>
   <p>Deal gently with her . Would you win her confidence ? There is but one passage to her affections . Speak that word — bolt and bar fly open : she takes you by the hand and welcomes you to her most sacred and secluded retreat . That word is sympathy : let her feel it in your tender embrace , see it in the glance of your eye , hear it in the modulation of your voice . It is for this she yearns and sighs , and refuses to be comforted where it is not .</p>
   <p>Bring her flowers — sweet , beautiful flowers . They are meet companions for her solitude . Gather blossoms from the whitening apple-bough , violets from the meadow , dandelions from the wayside . She will fold them more tenderly to her bosom than the rarest plants , for their faces are old , familiar ones , and she imagines they wear a look of pity .</p>
   <p>But there are more precious things than human sympathy ; there are sweeter flowers than violets or roses . They bloom on the prayer-consecrated mountains of Judea , amid the ancient olives of Gethsemane , along the Dolorous Way trodden by the Man of Sorrows , beneath the shadows of the Cross , and around the borrowed Sepulchre . Oh , gather them with no sparing hand : there are enough for you and her — enough for every sorrowing heart in the universe . Take them to the poor sufferer . Their fragrance will make the lonely chamber like a garden of spices ; the tearful eyes will turn heavenward , and the pale lips — tremulous with contrition will whisper , “ Father ; forgive me , for I knew not what I did when I murmured at thy dealings . ” Then a solemn hush will follow — a holy twilight of the soul ,— as if the sorrows of earth were blending with the joys of heaven , the pains of mortality with the blessedness of the angelic bards . Oh , these are the flowers for a sickroom ! How dreary and desolate does it seem without them ! The strong and healthy may live on , careless and irreligious , but what would become of the poor , grief-stricken , despairing Soul if she could not repose quietly in the bosom her Beloved , and say with child-like simplicity , morning and evening , “ Our Father who art in heaven ! ”</p>

    <head>SONGS OF HOPE</head>
     <l n="1">“ HE GIVETH SONGS IN THE NIGHT . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Gloriously the sun sinks behind the western hills . Half the sky seems on fire , and the other half wreathed with light fantastic clouds . All nature is beautiful — can I be sad ? Nay ; away with sadness , away with sorrow ; I will forget everything my strangeness , my blasted hopes , and seek for happiness where happiness only is to be found , in the sacred Oracles of God .— July 14 , 1852 .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">God sometimes speaks in earthquake and in storm ,</l>
     <l n="2">But oftener in the “ still small voice ” of love :</l>
     <l n="3">He urges men as loving fathers plead .</l>
     <l n="4">God is our Father , yet we shun his face</l>
     <l n="5">And hide ourselves when at the cool of day</l>
     <l n="6">He walketh in the garden !</l>
   </lg>
   <p>How sweet the thought that God , our heavenly Father , is omniscient . Our griefs are not hidden from him . He knows our hearts , and with all this knowledge he is good — so tender , so pitiful ! Oh , to love him as he deserves ! Oh , for a thousand tongues to sing his praises ! Tell the sick , tell the sorrowing , tell the broken-hearted of this God ; tell the wretched , the guilty , the wayward prodigal of this gracious Father .</p>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>THE LAST GOOD NIGHT .</head>
    <note>In the day of health and prosperity everybody feels like singing , but “ in the night ” of adversity grace must produce the song of holy confidence and hope . Such a song is the following , which has probably been printed oftener than any other of Miss JOHNSON 'S poems . It has appeared in several papers ; finds a place in Dewart 's “ Selections from Canadian Poets ” ; was set to music by George F. Root , and appears in his “ School for the Cabinet Organ . ” With many it has been a favorite .</note>

   <p>RETROSPECTIVE AND PROSPECTIVE .</p>
   <p>I remember the time when we went forth arm in arm over the newly mown fields , scaring the grasshoppers from our pathway , with our baskets on our arms , to gather the blueberries that hung in clusters on their slender stalks . But thou art gone now to the fairer fields of paradise , to pluck sweeter fruit than ever ripened here . Thou art gone ! The blueberry bushes have fallen long ago before the scythe ; the field has changed its appearance ; and as for me , the breezes woo me forth in vain — I cannot go . Sickness and sorrow have come between me and the love of earth ; they have cast a dark shadow over what I once thought fair . But as there can be no shadow without a light beyond it I have caught bright glimpses of a better home — a land of life and glory .</p>

    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>While looking over an old manuscript , written by one who is long since passed from time into eternity , I met with the following lines : “ It is six years to-day since my Elsa died , and five months since my Amanda left me forever . They sleep in the grave , and there they will remain through endless years . ” He then went on , in strains mournful and tender , and with all a father 's sorrow deplored his loss . I could not wonder that he wept the tears of anguish and despair if , as he said , they are to remain in the dark tomb through endless years . The glorious Resurrection morning was unknown to him . He saw only the tomb , and considered not that there is One who holds the keys of the grave , and who will soon burst the icy bars of death and bring forth the righteous to immortality . Truly that morning has charms for the Christian . God grant that if I am called to slumber for a while I may “ have part in the first resurrection . ” — June 22 , 1852 .</p>

   <p>EASTER SUNDAY .</p>
   <p>The old , the young , and the middle-aged all meet to-day in the house of prayer . From a thousand churches in our own and other lands the voice of praise and thanksgiving goes up to heaven — “ The Lord is risen ! ” Oh glorious tidings ! “ The Lord is risen indeed , ” and hath appeared to Peter ! aye , and to Mary also ,— the poor sinner whose touch would have been profanation to the Pharisees of our own times . And still more wonderful , He hath appeared to Thomas — to Thomas the infidel , who laughed at the story of the resurrection !</p>
   <p>THE RISEN REDEEMER .</p>
   <p>Rejoice now , O sorrowing bride , for he sleeps no longer . Let thy glad songs of praise and adoration reach the skies , for the Lord is not among the dead — he is risen . “ Rejoice greatly , O daughter of Zion ! shout , O daughter of Jerusalem ! ” for thy Savior has burst the iron bands of death and come forth a mighty conqueror . For thy sins he laid himself down in the icy tomb ; he rises again for thy justification . For thy iniquities he suffered , died and was buried : he comes forth again that thou mayest be a sharer of his glory . He has hallowed the dreary tomb by his own dear presence , and now he has ascended to his Father and your Father , to his God and your God . He has taken his seat at the right hand of the Majesty on high , and there , despairing soul , trembling under the burden of sin , he pleads for thee ( Heb . 7 : 25 ) . He points to the cross on Calvary , dripping with his own precious blood , and in a voice of tender compassion exclaims : “ Father , I died for that wretched sinner ; spare , oh spare him for my sake ! ” He has entered into the holy place by his own blood , having obtained eternal redemption for thee , O daughter of Zion .</p>

   <p>THE ONLY PERFECT ONE .</p>
   <p>I have just finished “ D'Aubigne ' s History of the Reformation . ” How many noble characters are here brought to light ! how many fervent Christians — how many lofty souls — how many holy hearts ! The firm and undaunted Luther , the gentle Melancthon , the brave and courageous Zwingle , the mild Ecolampadi — us , the zealous and fiery Farel — and a host of others equally noble in the Master 's cause . And yet they all had their faults ; not one of them was perfect . Though we may sometimes feel to deplore their failings , yet surely it is a comfort to the poor Christian , beset with temptations and wandering daily from the straight and narrow path , to look back upon the lives of the best of earth 's sons — the noblest and the holiest ,— and behold that even they sometimes went astray . It buoys up his soul with new hope and courage . It bids it cast aside every thought of justification save by faith in Jesus Christ . It increases that faith , and directs the weary pilgrim to the feet of Him who alone is holy and perfect .— June 30 , 1852 .</p>

   <p>COMPLETE IN HIM .</p>
   <p>Does not the blood of Jesus alone cleanse from all sin ? - who but sinners are invited to the great Fountain ? Are my robes filthy ?— where can they be made white but in the blood of the Lamb ? Is my heart obdurate and unbelieving ?— who can soften and subdue it save the Almighty One who listens to its throbbings and knows all its trouble ? Am I tempted , sorely tempted ?— who can pity like Him who in the wilderness met face to face the great enemy , the great tempter of mankind ? Ah , my poor heart aches when I think of all that is in the past and of all the future may have in store for me . But is there no balm in Gilead ? is there no physician there ? Will He not take me by the hand and whisper , “ Be of good cheer ; thy sins are forgiven thee ” ? Will He not heal thy wounds by pouring into them the oil of consolation ? He has promised to do this — yea , much more than this ; and will he for the first time in the history of mankind fail to perform what he has spoken ? Nay , nay , and I will doubt no longer .... O Jesus , my Mediator , my Redeemer , have compassion upon me , and declare thyself to the Father as THE LORD MY RIGHTEOUSNESS .— Sept . 1860 .</p>

    <head>A PARADOX .</head>
    <head>Alone , and yet not alone am I ; sad , and yet not sad . No human form intrudes upon my solitude , and yet He who fills creation with himself is surely with me ; sad I am , for there are many earthly thoughts that contribute to cast a shade upon my soul , and yet heavenly thoughts soon dispel such mournful ones . Oh , that my whole affection might be placed upon things above , and not on things on the earth ! Why should my heart be gloomy when such a glorious prospect opens before me ?— a world of immortal beauty , enlivened by the presence of God himself , and a glorious city , even the New Jerusalem . “ Fly , lingering moments , fly away , and bring that long expected day ” when Christ shall appear in glory to take his weary children home .</head>

   <p>WHAT THE DAUGHTER OF THE CLOUD SAID .</p>
   <p>Down the spout a torrent gushed , to be pent up in an old , dark tub , and made the slave of the washerwoman . Would it not have been better for thee , O water , to have fallen in the beautiful forest ? to lie in the bosom of the lily , or become a looking glass for the many colored insects ? “ I would be useful , ” whispered the daughter of the cloud , “ therefore I have stooped to an humble action — I left the abode of the lightning . My lot is a lowly one ; my life full of sorrow and humiliation . I must pass through a fiery ordeal ; I must be cast out and despised by those whom I have served . But then will be the time of my exaltation : the blessed Sun will take pity upon me , and make me a gem of beauty in the angels ’ highway ! ”</p>
   <note>Though no application has been made of this similitude , yet the truth designed to be taught is easily gathered : The Christian may be called to many a lowly act — to a ministration which will subject him to reproach and suffering here , but the day of exaltation is sure to come . “ He that humbleth himself shall be exalted . ” The day hastens when from the heavens the Saviour will descend , “ who will transform the body of our humiliation , that it may be conformed to the body of his glory . ” — Phil . 3 : 21 ( Am . Bible Union Trans . ) . How glorious will the humble workers of earth appear when they are beautified by the Sun of righteousness in the resurrection morning ! That will be all Easter day of surpassing loveliness .</note>

   <p>WORDS OF CHEER FOR FAINTING CHRISTIANS .</p>
   <p>Poor pilgrim , weary with the toils of life , distressed and afflicted on every hand , persecuted and forsaken by thy fellowmen , hast thou ever fathomed the depths of that glorious declaration , “ I will never leave thee , nor forsake thee ” ?— Heb . 13 : 5 . Hast thou ever realized that in whatever situation thou mayest be placed — on the mountains of delight or in the vale of humiliation , in sickness or in health , in prosperity or in adversity , in life or in death — thou art under the immediate protection of the great Shepherd of Israel , who never sleeps nor slumbers ? The heavens may gather blackness , the storm may come down in fury , but He who whispered , “ Peace , be still , ” to the raging billows , is “ the same yesterday , to-day and forever ” ; and though now invisible his presence is with thee as truly and as really as it was with the timid band of disciples on the stormy sea of Galilee . The same Jesus that walked the streets of Jerusalem ,— the pitiful , the affectionate , the tender-hearted ,— is an eye-witness of all thy tears , thy trials and temptations . His ear , which was never closed to the cry of the poor and needy , is still open to thy call ; and the heart which embraced the whole universe has a place for thee . The fires upon thy altar may have grown dim ; the sacrifice may have been the poor and lean of thy flock ; but the coals of divine love are bright upon the heavenly altar ; and the great Sacrifice — the Lamb without spot or blemish-whispers of Calvary and Gethsemane , and mentions thee in his intercession .</p>
   <p>Amazing love ! love never to be fathomed . Angels who wait to do his ’ bidding , seraphim and cherubim who behold his face in glory , can ye comprehend the height and depth , the length and breadth of the Saviour 's love ? Ah ! angels , and seraphim , and cherubim still bend above the mercy-seat and “ desire to look into ” these things ; but ages on ages of eternity may roll away and the love that bowed the heavens for sinful and degraded mortals shall still remain an unsounded deep ! And this love is for thee — for thee —, poor pilgrim . Plunge then deeply into this unfathomable ocean . Fear not to loosen thy hold upon the shore : there is nothing there worthy thy love . Thou art an heir of immortality , and the pleasures which endure for a season should be nothing to thee . Wealth , and honor , and power are only the gildings of a groaning and sin-cursed earth . The shouts of mirth and revelry borne upon the midnight air , are only the prelude to tears and sighs and mourning . Behind thee is the blackness of despair , before thee the everlasting sunshine . Away , away ! tarry not to sip water from the broken cistern , for the living fountain gushes forth , clear as crystal ; and the invitation is for all : “ Ho , every one that thirsteth ” ( Isa . 55 : 1 ; Rev . 21 : 6 ; 22 : 17 ) .— Aug . 10 , 1856 .</p>

    <head>A LONG DELIGHTFUL WALK .</head>
    <head>While reading to-day an account of the descendants of Adam my mind was particularly struck with the short but comprehensive narrative of Enoch : “ He walked with God , and he was not ; for God took him ” ( Gen. 5 : 21-24 ) . He “ walked with God , ” and how long ? “ Three hundred years ” after he begat Methuselah . Oh , how strange that it should be so hard for me to walk in the commandments of the Lord even for a few days !

   <p>SENTENTIOUS PARAGRAPHS .</p>
   <p>Rest , but few can comprehend the word . At morn I speak it , but at midnight most , and then ‘ tis music ! Oh , the thought of rest — of perfect freedom , from distress and pain — of health , of vigor in each nerve and limb . The thought inspires , consoles , and makes me pray for fear I shall lose the blessing . Grant me , O God , a patient heart ; and may my will be so conformed to thine , that I may wait thy own good pleasure , whatsoever it be .</p>
   <p>There are moments when Calvary overshadows Mount Sinai ; when the blessed words , “ It is finished , ” swell long and loud above the roar of thunder and the sound of trumpets ; when the Cross conceals the Tables of stone bearing the holy law of the Almighty , and then I can boldly reply to the upbraidings of Conscience , “ There is now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus . ”</p>
   <p>Sing , my heart , for the day cometh wherein the night shall be no more at all remembered ; the clouds shall melt like vapor , and the voice of mourning and lamentation shall be heard no more forever . Awake and sing !</p>

   <p>SIMILES .</p>
   <p>Beneath the snow and frost of winter there are living seeds which shall produce abundant harvests : so beneath a cold exterior there may be a heart full of high resolves and glorious impulses , which at the right season shall burst into blossom and bear precious fruit .</p>
   <p>How often the sun rises in a cloudless sky , to be obscured before noonday ! Human life is like our fickle clime : to-day all sunshine , and to-morrow clouds . The sun is the same by day and night , but the earth comes betwixt his light and us : so when the Sun of righteousness seems to have left our horizon and we turn in vain to the right and the left to find him , may it not be that the dark , dense earth has come betwixt us and his life-giving beams , while He remains “ the same yesterday , to-day and forever ” ?</p>
   <p>The thistle has a fragrant smell , and the thorn a pleasant fruit . It is a disease in the shell-fish that makes the pearl : so your sickness , my friend , may be the means of your winning the Pearl of great price .</p>
   <p>What plant would thrive if the sun shone forever ? and what should we be if the sun of prosperity always shone upon our pathway ? Along life 's dusty thoroughfare I see the world , but not as I saw it once : sickness and sorrow have given me another pair of eyes .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Gentle breezes , balmy breezes ,</l>
     <l n="2">There is vigor in your breath ,</l>
     <l n="3">But ye cannot bring the roses</l>
     <l n="4">To the leaden cheeks of death !</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The soil that produces the rankest weeds would by proper care and cultivation produce the richest crops : so will the human heart when regenerated by grace and truth .</p>
   <p>The violet cannot become the rose , the daisy cannot be the lily ; and if they could all be the loveliest flower , earth would lose half its beauty . Without variety , a scene however fair within itself soon wearies us . Knowest thou the moral ? Be content in thy proper sphere : then mayest be the violet or the daisy , but envy not the rose and the lily ; all are beautiful when in their appointed place .</p>
   <p>At morn the shadows slant toward the west , but toward the east at night : so when the sun of life declines the shadows stretch away toward the everlasting hills whence the eternal beams of day shall arise .</p>

   <p>WHEN SHALL I RECEIVE MY DIPLOMA ?</p>
   <p>For many long years I have been in the school of affliction , and during that time how often I have asked the questions , When will my course be completed ? when shall I receive my diploma ? But let me first consider : Am I prepared for the grand examination in which angels are to be the spectators , and God himself judge ? Here teachers and professors — however skilled in human wisdom , friends and relatives — however anxious for my welfare , must step aside and leave me alone before the dread tribunal ! In the presence of my fellow-creatures I might wear the robes of hypocrisy and appear in reality what I am not ; but what would this avail me in the presence of Him who knows every thought even before it is formed , and whose searching eye can take in at a single glance the past , present , and future of my history ?</p>
   <p>O dreaded hour ! who can wonder that timid mortals put it far in the distance , and even strive to shut their eyes to its stern reality ? What folly ! Were the light of revelation quenched forever , there is that within every human breast which warns of a judgment to come and of a righteous retribution . Swift as the planets roll in their orbits around the sun , still swifter advances that terrible scene around which the hopes and fears , the joys and miseries of eternity cluster . It is the great centre of attraction , not only for one age or one nation , but for all who have drawn the breath of life from the grand creation anthem of stars and angels ( Job 38 : 4-7 ) till stars and angels again lift up their voices in concert , and swear that “ Time shall be no longer . ” Yet the life , the heart of each individual there will be as closely examined as if the court of Heaven were sitting for him alone , and he the only person for whom the joys of Paradise or the pains of Hell were prepared by eternal Justice !</p>

   <p>THE BELIEVER 'S SAFETY .</p>
   <p>Ah , Christian , why is thy heart sad and thy brow clouded ? Hast thou been gazing down into the depths of thine own soul , and — art thou startled at what thou hast there seen ? Hast thou met with evil thoughts which thou wouldst gladly never have harbored , and art thou despairing because of thy short-comings and unworthiness ? Art thou looking to the future with dread , and trembling lest in the hour of trial and temptation thou wilt fall ?</p>
   <p>Turn away thine eyes from the pollution of thine own sinful heart , and gaze upon One who has become a perfect sin-offering for thee . True , thou art frail and unworthy , but the Lamb that was slain is worthy , and his perfection is enough for thee ; his righteousness alone recommends thee to the Father . Dost thou trust in him with all thy heart ? Dost thou hope for eternal life because he died ? Then thou art safe . “ The eternal God is thy refuge , and underneath thee are the everlasting arms . ” The storms may howl , and tempests may gather around thee ; the billows may rage , but they only lash the Rock upon which thou standest . “ Though the earth be removed , and the mountains be cast into the midst of the sea ; ” yet thou art safe , for he who made the heavens and the earth is thy Father . He who commandeth the sun , and it riseth not , and sealeth up the stars ; “ who alone spreadeth out the heavens and treadeth upon the waves of the sea , ” is thy nearest and dearest friend . The same voice which said , “ Let there be light , and there was light ; ” which commanded the raging waters , “ Hitherto shalt thou come , but no farther : and here shall thy proud waves be stayed , ” is still whispering in thine ear , “ Fear thee not , for I am with thee ; be not dismayed , for I am thy God . ” Yes , thou art safe ! thou art trusting in the mighty One of Israel , and thou shalt never be confounded .</p>
   <p>Thou hast been looking away into the regions of the blessed ; thou hast beheld with an eye of faith the things which God has prepared for those that love him , and amid the ineffable glory of that beautiful world thou hast heard the voices of the redeemed from the earth , saying : “ Salvation to our God which sitteth upon the throne , and unto the Lamb , ” until thou hast longed to join with them in the song of redemption , singing praises forever and ever to him who has ransomed thee with his own precious blood . Then a cloud has gathered over thee , thy sinfulness has risen like a mountain , and thou hast sighed in thy spirit , “ Oh , that I were sure of a part with them ; oh , that I was safe as they ! ” and thou art as safe this moment with thy feet upon the Rock of Ages , as if thou didst walk the golden streets of the New Jerusalem , or bow with the angelic hosts around the dazzling throne of thy Creator . Thou art safe , for thy “ life is hid with Christ in God ” ; and could'st thou ask for a surer hiding-place ! Thou hast entered into an everlasting covenant with the King of kings , and while thou dost cling to his side shall it ever be broken ? Thou hast entrusted thy soul into his hands , and is he not able to “ keep that which thou hast committed unto him ? ” Thine enemies are many and powerful , but what are they compared to the living God ? In the hour of temptation “ he will never leave thee nor forsake thee ” ; when thy foes surround thee on every side , and the darkness of midnight gathers over thy soul , the Almighty arm shall lift up a standard , and thou shalt safely repose “ under the shadow of his wings . ” “ The Lord is thy rock , and thy fortress , and thy deliverer . ” “ The Lord is thy light and thy salvation ; whom shalt thou fear ? The Lord is the strength of thy life , of whom shalt thou be afraid ? ”</p>
   <p>Then look up , Christian ! ‘ tis no time for desponding . The glittering spires of the Eternal City are already heaving in sight ; perchance another storm , another beating against the fragile bark , and thou art there ! Already the music of that glorious land steals softly over the roaring billows , and reminds thee thou art nearing the peaceful shore . Already the dark cloud which gathers above thy head is tinged with the beams of immortal glory , and away in the distance thou canst behold the first faint glimmerings of the Morning Star . Joy for thee , O wanderer ! the shadows of the night are passing away , and the unclouded morning comes on apace !</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Yes , thou art safe ! lift up thine eyes ,</l>
     <l n="2">And calm thy anxious fears ;</l>
     <l n="3">The Sun of glory gilds the skies ,</l>
     <l n="4">And Christ thy life appears .</l>
