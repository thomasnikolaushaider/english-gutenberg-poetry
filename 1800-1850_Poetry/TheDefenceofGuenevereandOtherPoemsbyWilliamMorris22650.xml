    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="2">But , knowing now that they would have her speak ,</l>
     <l n="3">She threw her wet hair backward from her brow ,</l>
     <l n="4">Her hand close to her mouth touching her cheek ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="5">As though she had had there a shameful blow ,</l>
     <l n="6">And feeling it shameful to feel ought but shame</l>
     <l n="7">All through her heart , yet felt her cheek burned so ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="8">She must a little touch it ; like one lame</l>
     <l n="9">She walked away from Gauwaine , with her head</l>
     <l n="10">Still lifted up ; and on her cheek of flame</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="11">The tears dried quick ; she stopped at last and said :</l>
     <l n="12">O knights and lords , it seems but little skill</l>
     <l n="13">To talk of well-known things past now and dead .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="14">God wot I ought to say , I have done ill ,</l>
     <l n="15">And pray you all forgiveness heartily !</l>
     <l n="16">Because you must be right , such great lords ; still</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="17">Listen , suppose your time were come to die ,</l>
     <l n="18">And you were quite alone and very weak ;</l>
     <l n="19">Yea , laid a dying while very mightily</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="20">The wind was ruffling up the narrow streak</l>
     <l n="21">Of river through your broad lands running well :</l>
     <l n="22">Suppose a hush should come , then some one speak :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="23">‘ One of these cloths is heaven , and one is hell ,</l>
     <l n="24">Now choose one cloth for ever ; which they be ,</l>
     <l n="25">I will not tell you , you must somehow tell</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="26">Of your own strength and mightiness ; here , see ! ’</l>
     <l n="27">Yea , yea , my lord , and you to ope your eyes ,</l>
     <l n="28">At foot of your familiar bed to see</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="29">A great God 's angel standing , with such dyes ,</l>
     <l n="30">Not known on earth , on his great wings , and hands ,</l>
     <l n="31">Held out two ways , light from the inner skies</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="32">Showing him well , and making his commands</l>
     <l n="33">Seem to be God 's commands , moreover , too ,</l>
     <l n="34">Holding within his hands the cloths on wands ;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="35">And one of these strange choosing cloths was blue ,</l>
     <l n="36">Wavy and long , and one cut short and red ;</l>
     <l n="37">No man could tell the better of the two .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="38">After a shivering half-hour you said :</l>
     <l n="39">‘ God help ! heaven 's colour , the blue ; ’ and he said , ‘ hell . ’</l>
     <l n="40">Perhaps you then would roll upon your bed ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="41">And cry to all good men that loved you well ,</l>
     <l n="42">‘ Ah Christ ! if only I had known , known , known ; ’</l>
     <l n="43">Launcelot went away , then I could tell ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="44">Like wisest man how all things would be , moan ,</l>
     <l n="45">And roll and hurt myself , and long to die ,</l>
     <l n="46">And yet fear much to die for what was sown .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="47">Nevertheless you , O Sir Gauwaine , lie ,</l>
     <l n="48">Whatever may have happened through these years ,</l>
     <l n="49">God knows I speak truth , saying that you lie .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="50">Her voice was low at first , being full of tears ,</l>
     <l n="51">But as it cleared , it grew full loud and shrill ,</l>
     <l n="52">Growing a windy shriek in all men 's ears ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="19">
     <l n="53">A ringing in their startled brains , until</l>
     <l n="54">She said that Gauwaine lied , then her voice sunk ,</l>
     <l n="55">And her great eyes began again to fill ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="20">
     <l n="56">Though still she stood right up , and never shrunk ,</l>
     <l n="57">But spoke on bravely , glorious lady fair !</l>
     <l n="58">Whatever tears her full lips may have drunk ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="21">
     <l n="59">She stood , and seemed to think , and wrung her hair ,</l>
     <l n="60">Spoke out at last with no more trace of shame ,</l>
     <l n="61">With passionate twisting of her body there :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="22">
     <l n="62">It chanced upon a day that Launcelot came</l>
     <l n="63">To dwell at Arthur 's court : at Christmas-time</l>
     <l n="64">This happened ; when the heralds sung his name ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="23">
     <l n="65">Son of King Ban of Benwick , seemed to chime</l>
     <l n="66">Along with all the bells that rang that day ,</l>
     <l n="67">O'er the white roofs , with little change of rhyme .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="24">
     <l n="68">Christmas and whitened winter passed away ,</l>
     <l n="69">And over me the April sunshine came ,</l>
     <l n="70">Made very awful with black hail-clouds , yea</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="25">
     <l n="71">And in the Summer I grew white with flame ,</l>
     <l n="72">And bowed my head down : Autumn , and the sick</l>
     <l n="73">Sure knowledge things would never be the same ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="26">
     <l n="74">However often Spring might be most thick</l>
     <l n="75">Of blossoms and buds , smote on me , and I grew</l>
     <l n="76">Careless of most things , let the clock tick , tick ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="27">
     <l n="77">To my unhappy pulse , that beat right through</l>
     <l n="78">My eager body ; while I laughed out loud ,</l>
     <l n="79">And let my lips curl up at false or true ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="28">
     <l n="80">Seemed cold and shallow without any cloud .</l>
     <l n="81">Behold my judges , then the cloths were brought ;</l>
     <l n="82">While I was dizzied thus , old thoughts would crowd ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="29">
     <l n="83">Belonging to the time ere I was bought</l>
     <l n="84">By Arthur 's great name and his little love ;</l>
     <l n="85">Must I give up for ever then , I thought ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="30">
     <l n="86">That which I deemed would ever round me move</l>
     <l n="87">Glorifying all things ; for a little word ,</l>
     <l n="88">Scarce ever meant at all , must I now prove</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="31">
     <l n="89">Stone-cold for ever ? Pray you , does the Lord</l>
     <l n="90">Will that all folks should be quite happy and good ?</l>
     <l n="91">I love God now a little , if this cord</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="32">
     <l n="92">Were broken , once for all what striving could</l>
     <l n="93">Make me love anything in earth or heaven ?</l>
     <l n="94">So day by day it grew , as if one should</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="33">
     <l n="95">Slip slowly down some path worn smooth and even ,</l>
     <l n="96">Down to a cool sea on a summer day ;</l>
     <l n="97">Yet still in slipping there was some small leaven</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="34">
     <l n="98">Of stretched hands catching small stones by the way ,</l>
     <l n="99">Until one surely reached the sea at last ,</l>
     <l n="100">And felt strange new joy as the worn head lay</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="35">
     <l n="101">Back , with the hair like sea-weed ; yea all past</l>
     <l n="102">Sweat of the forehead , dryness of the lips ,</l>
     <l n="103">Washed utterly out by the dear waves o'ercast ,</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>In the lone sea , far off from any ships ! Do I not know now of a day in Spring ? No minute of that wild day ever slips</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">From out my memory ; I hear thrushes sing ,</l>
     <l n="2">And wheresoever I may be , straightway</l>
     <l n="3">Thoughts of it all come up with most fresh sting :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="4">I was half mad with beauty on that day ,</l>
     <l n="5">And went without my ladies all alone ,</l>
     <l n="6">In a quiet garden walled round every way ;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="7">I was right joyful of that wall of stone ,</l>
     <l n="8">That shut the flowers and trees up with the sky ,</l>
     <l n="9">And trebled all the beauty : to the bone ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="10">Yea right through to my heart , grown very shy</l>
     <l n="11">With weary thoughts , it pierced , and made me glad ;</l>
     <l n="12">Exceedingly glad , and I knew verily ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="13">A little thing just then had made me mad ;</l>
     <l n="14">I dared not think , as I was wont to do ,</l>
     <l n="15">Sometimes , upon my beauty ; If I had</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="16">Held out my long hand up against the blue ,</l>
     <l n="17">And , looking on the tenderly darken 'd fingers ,</l>
     <l n="18">Thought that by rights one ought to see quite through ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="19">There , see you , where the soft still light yet lingers ,</l>
     <l n="20">Round by the edges ; what should I have done ,</l>
     <l n="21">If this had joined with yellow spotted singers ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="22">And startling green drawn upward by the sun ?</l>
     <l n="23">But shouting , loosed out , see now ! all my hair ,</l>
     <l n="24">And trancedly stood watching the west wind run</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="25">With faintest half-heard breathing sound ; why there</l>
     <l n="26">I lose my head e'en now in doing this ;</l>
     <l n="27">But shortly listen : In that garden fair</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="28">Came Launcelot walking ; this is true , the kiss</l>
     <l n="29">Wherewith we kissed in meeting that spring day ,</l>
     <l n="30">I scarce dare talk of the remember 'd bliss ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="31">When both our mouths went wandering in one way ,</l>
     <l n="32">And aching sorely , met among the leaves ;</l>
     <l n="33">Our hands being left behind strained far away .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="34">Never within a yard of my bright sleeves</l>
     <l n="35">Had Launcelot come before : and now , so nigh !</l>
     <l n="36">After that day why is it Guenevere grieves ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="37">Nevertheless you , O Sir Gauwaine , lie ,</l>
     <l n="38">Whatever happened on through all those years ,</l>
     <l n="39">God knows I speak truth , saying that you lie .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="40">Being such a lady could I weep these tears</l>
     <l n="41">If this were true ? A great queen such as I</l>
     <l n="42">Having sinn 'd this way , straight her conscience sears ;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="43">And afterwards she liveth hatefully ,</l>
     <l n="44">Slaying and poisoning , certes never weeps :</l>
     <l n="45">Gauwaine be friends now , speak me lovingly .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="46">Do I not see how God 's dear pity creeps</l>
     <l n="47">All through your frame , and trembles in your mouth ?</l>
     <l n="48">Remember in what grave your mother sleeps ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="49">Buried in some place far down in the south ,</l>
     <l n="50">Men are forgetting as I speak to you ;</l>
     <l n="51">By her head sever 'd in that awful drouth</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="52">Of pity that drew Agravaine 's fell blow ,</l>
     <l n="53">I pray your pity ! let me not scream out</l>
     <l n="54">For ever after , when the shrill winds blow</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="19">
     <l n="55">Through half your castle-locks ! let me not shout</l>
     <l n="56">For ever after in the winter night</l>
     <l n="57">When you ride out alone ! in battle-rout</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Let not my rusting tears make your sword light ! Ah ! God of mercy , how he turns away ! So , ever must I dress me to the fight ,</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">So : let God 's justice work ! Gauwaine , I say ,</l>
     <l n="2">See me hew down your proofs : yea all men know</l>
     <l n="3">Even as you said how Mellyagraunce one day ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="4">One bitter day in la Fausse Garde , for so</l>
     <l n="5">All good knights held it after , saw :</l>
     <l n="6">Yea , sirs , by cursed unknightly outrage ; though</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="7">You , Gauwaine , held his word without a flaw ,</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="10">To make a queen say why some spots of red</l>
     <l n="11">Lie on her coverlet ? or will you say :</l>
     <l n="12">Your hands are white , lady , as when you wed ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="13">Where did you bleed ? and must I stammer out , Nay ,</l>
     <l n="14">I blush indeed , fair lord , only to rend</l>
     <l n="15">My sleeve up to my shoulder , where there lay</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">

     <l n="3">When Guesclin told him he must be hanged soon ,</l>
     <l n="4">Within a while he lifted up his head</l>
     <l n="5">And spoke for his own life ; not crouching , though ,</l>
     <l n="6">As abjectly afraid to die , nor yet</l>
     <l n="7">Sullenly brave as many a thief will die ,</l>
     <l n="8">Nor yet as one that plays at japes with God :</l>
     <l n="9">Few words he spoke ; not so much what he said</l>
     <l n="10">Moved us , I think , as , saying it , there played</l>
     <l n="11">Strange tenderness from that big soldier there</l>
     <l n="12">About his pleading ; eagerness to live</l>
     <l n="13">Because folk loved him , and he loved them back ,</l>
     <l n="14">And many gallant plans unfinish 'd now</l>
     <l n="15">For ever . Clisson 's heart , which may God bless !</l>
     <l n="16">Was moved to pray for him , but all in vain ;</l>

     <l n="2">And now to keep myself from going mad .</l>
     <l n="3">Christ ! I have been a many times to church ,</l>
     <l n="4">And , ever since my mother taught me prayers ,</l>
     <l n="5">Have used them daily , but to-day I wish</l>

     <l n="7">O Christ , that I may clasp your knees and pray</l>
     <l n="8">I know not what ; at any rate come now</l>
     <l n="9">From one of many places where you are ,</l>
     <l n="10">Either in Heaven amid thick angel wings ,</l>
     <l n="11">Or sitting on the altar strange with gems ,</l>
     <l n="12">Or high up in the duskness of the apse ;</l>
     <l n="13">Let us go , You and I , a long way off ,</l>
     <l n="14">To the little damp , dark , Poitevin church .</l>
     <l n="15">While you sit on the coffin in the dark ,</l>
     <l n="16">Will I lie down , my face on the bare stone</l>
     <l n="17">Between your feet , and chatter anything</l>
     <l n="18">I have heard long ago . What matters it</l>
     <l n="19">So I may keep you there , your solemn face</l>
     <l n="20">And long hair even-flowing on each side ,</l>
     <l n="21">Until you love me well enough to speak ,</l>
     <l n="22">And give me comfort ? yea , till o'er your chin ,</l>
     <l n="23">And cloven red beard the great tears roll down</l>

     <l n="26">Eh Guesclin ! if I were</l>
     <l n="27">Like Countess Mountfort now , that kiss 'd the knight ,</l>
     <l n="28">Across the salt sea come to fight for her :</l>
     <l n="29">Ah ! just to go about with many knights ,</l>
     <l n="30">Wherever you went , and somehow on one day ,</l>
     <l n="31">In a thick wood to catch you off your guard ,</l>
     <l n="32">Let you find , you and your some fifty friends ,</l>
     <l n="33">Nothing but arrows wheresoe'er you turn 'd ,</l>
     <l n="34">Yea , and red crosses , great spears over them ;</l>
     <l n="35">And so , between a lane of my true men ,</l>
     <l n="36">To walk up pale and stern and tall , and with</l>
     <l n="37">My arms on my surcoat , and his therewith ,</l>
     <l n="38">And then to make you kneel , O knight Guesclin ;</l>
     <l n="39">And then : alas ! alas ! when all is said ,</l>
     <l n="40">What could I do but let you go again ,</l>
     <l n="41">Being pitiful woman ? I get no revenge ,</l>
     <l n="42">Whatever happens ; and I get no comfort :</l>
     <l n="43">I am but weak , and cannot move my feet ,</l>
     <l n="44">But as men bid me .</l>
