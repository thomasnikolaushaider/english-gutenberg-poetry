   <p>[ Why is it that Poetry has never yet been subjected to that process of Dilution which has proved so advantageous to her sister-art Music ? The Diluter gives us first a few notes of some well-known Air , then a dozen bars of his own , then a few more notes of the Air , and so on alternately : thus saving the listener , if not from all risk of recognising the melody at all , at least from the too-exciting transports which it might produce in a more concentrated form . The process is termed “ setting ” by Composers , and any one , that has ever experienced the emotion of being unexpectedly set down in a heap of mortar , will recognise the truthfulness of this happy phrase .</p>
   <p>For truly , just as the genuine Epicure lingers lovingly over a morsel of supreme Venison — whose every fibre seems to murmur “ Excelsior ! ” — yet swallows , ere returning to the toothsome dainty , great mouthfuls of oatmeal-porridge and winkles : and just as the perfect Connoisseur in Claret permits himself but one delicate sip , and then tosses off a pint or more of boarding-school beer : so also ——</p>

    <head>THE HUNTING OF THE SNARK ,</head>
     <l n="1">An Agony in Eight Fits .</l>
   </lg>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>PREFACE .</head>
    <head>If — and the thing is wildly possible — the charge of writing nonsense were ever brought against the author of this brief but instructive poem , it would be based , I feel convinced , on the line ( in p. 144 )</head>
     <l n="1">“ Then the bowsprit got mixed with the rudder sometimes : ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>In view of this painful possibility , I will not ( as I might ) appeal indignantly to my other writings as a proof that I am incapable of such a deed : I will not ( as I might ) point to the strong moral purpose of this poem itself , to the arithmetical principles so cautiously inculcated in it , or to its noble teachings in Natural History — I will take the more prosaic course of simply explaining how it happened .</p>
   <p>The Bellman , who was almost morbidly sensitive about appearances , used to have the bowsprit unshipped once or twice a week to be revarnished ; and it more than once happened , when the time came for replacing it , that no one on board could remember which end of the ship it belonged to . They knew it was not of the slightest use to appeal to the Bellman about it — he would only refer to his Naval Code , and read out in pathetic tones Admiralty Instructions which none of them had ever been able to understand — so it generally ended in its being fastened on , anyhow , across the rudder . The helmsman<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>used to stand by with tears in his eyes : he knew it was all wrong , but alas ! Rule 42 of the Code , “ No one shall speak to the Man at the Helm , ” had been completed by the Bellman himself with the words “ and the Man at the Helm shall speak to no one . ” So remonstrance was impossible , and no steering could be done till the next varnishing day . During these bewildering intervals the ship usually sailed backwards .</p>
   <p>As this poem is to some extent connected with the lay of the Jabberwock , let me take this opportunity of answering a question that has often been asked me , how to pronounce “ slithy toves . ” The “ i ” in “ slithy ” is long , as in “ writhe ” ; and “ toves ” is pronounced so as to rhyme with “ groves . ” Again , the first “ o ” in “ borogoves ” is pronounced like the “ o ” in “ borrow . ” I have heard people try to give it the sound of the “ o ” in “ worry . ” Such is Human Perversity .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>This office was usually undertaken by the Boots , who found in it a refuge from the Baker 's constant complaints about the insufficient blacking of his three pair of boots .</p>
   <p>This also seems a fitting occasion to notice the other hard words in that poem . Humpty-Dumpty 's theory , of two meanings packed into one word like a portmanteau , seems to me the right explanation for all .</p>
   <p>For instance , take the two words “ fuming ” and “ furious . ” Make up your mind that you will say both words , but leave it unsettled which you will say first . Now open your mouth and speak . If your thoughts incline ever so little towards “ fuming , ” you will say “ fuming-furious ” ; if they turn , by even a hair 's breadth towards “ furious , ” you will say “ furious-fuming ” ; but if you have that rarest of gifts , a perfectly balanced mind , you will say “ frumious . ”</p>
   <p>Supposing that , when Pistol uttered the well-known words —</p>
   <p>“ Under which king , Bezonian ? Speak or die ! ”</p>
   <p>Justice Shallow had felt certain that it was either William or Richard , but had not been able to settle which , so that he could not possibly say either name before the other , can it be doubted that , rather than die , he would have gasped out “ Rilchiam ! ”</p>
   <p>Fit the First .</p>
