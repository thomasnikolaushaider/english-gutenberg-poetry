     <lg type="stanza" n="1">
      <l n="1">O'er royal London , in luxuriant May ,</l>
      <l n="2">While lamps yet twinkled , dawning crept the day .</l>
      <l n="3">Home from the hell the pale-eyed gamester steals ;</l>
      <l n="4">Home from the ball flash jaded Beauty 's wheels ;</l>
      <l n="5">The lean grimalkin , who , since night began ,</l>
      <l n="6">Hath hymn 'd to love amidst the wrath of man ,</l>
      <l n="7">Scared from his raptures by the morning star ,</l>
      <l n="8">Flits finely by , and threads the area bar ;</l>
      <l n="9">From fields suburban rolls the early cart ;</l>
      <l n="10">As rests the revel , so awakes the mart .</l>
      <l n="11">Transfusing Mocha from the beans within ,</l>
      <l n="12">Bright by the crossing gleams the alchemic tin ,—</l>
      <l n="13">There halts the craftsman ; there , with envious sigh ,</l>
      <l n="14">The houseless vagrant looks , and limps foot-weary by .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="2">
      <l n="15">Behold that street ,— the Omphalos of Town !</l>
      <l n="16">Where the grim palace wears the prison 's frown ,</l>
      <l n="17">As mindful still , amidst a gaudier race ,</l>
      <l n="18">Of the veil 'd Genius of the mournful Place —</l>
      <l n="19">Of floors no majesty but Griefs had trod ,</l>
      <l n="20">And weary limbs that only knelt to God . [ A ]</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="3">
      <l n="21">What tales , what morals , of the elder day —</l>
      <l n="22">If stones had language — could that street convey !</l>
      <l n="23">Why yell the human bloodhounds panting there ?—</l>
      <l n="24">To drown the Stuart 's last forgiving prayer . [ B ]</l>
      <l n="25">Again the bloodhounds !— whither would they run ?</l>
      <l n="26">To lick the feet of Stuart 's ribald son .</l>
      <l n="27">There , through the dusk-red towers , amidst his ring</l>
      <l n="28">Of Vans and Mynheers , rode the Dutchman king ;</l>
      <l n="29">And there — did England 's Goneril thrill to hear</l>
      <l n="30">The shouts that triumph 'd o'er her crownless Lear ?</l>
      <l n="31">There , where the gaslight streams on Crockford 's door ,</l>
      <l n="32">Bluff Henry chuckled at the jests of More ;</l>
      <l n="33">There , where you gaze upon the last H. B .,</l>
      <l n="34">Swift paused , and mutter 'd , “ Shall I have that see ? ”</l>
      <l n="35">There , where yon pile , for party 's common weal ,</l>
      <l n="36">Knits votes that serve , with hearts abhorring , Peel ,</l>
      <l n="37">Blunt Walpole seized , and roughly bought , his man ;—</l>
      <l n="38">Or , tired of Polly , St. John lounged to Anne .</l>
      <l n="39">Well , let the world change on ,— still must endure</l>
      <l n="40">While Earth is Earth , one changeless race — the Poor !</l>
      <l n="41">Within that street , on yonder threshold stone ,</l>
      <l n="42">What sits as stone-like ?— Penury , claim thine own !</l>
      <l n="43">She sate , the homeless wanderer ,— with calm eyes</l>
      <l n="44">Looking through tears , yet lifted to the skies ;</l>
      <l n="45">Wistful , but patient , sorrowful , but mild ,</l>
      <l n="46">As asking God when He would claim his child .</l>
      <l n="47">A face too youthful for so hush 'd a grief ;—</l>
      <l n="48">The worm that gnaw 'd the core had spared the leaf ;</l>
      <l n="49">Though worn the cheek , with hunger , or with care ,</l>
      <l n="50">Yet still the soft fresh childlike bloom was there ;</l>
      <l n="51">And each might touch you with an equal gloom ,</l>
      <l n="52">The youth , the care , the hunger , and the bloom ;—</l>
      <l n="53">As if , when round the cradle of the child</l>
      <l n="54">With lavish gifts the gentler fairies smiled ,</l>
      <l n="55">One vengeful sprite , forgotten as the guest ,</l>
      <l n="56">Had breathed a spell to disenchant the rest ,</l>
      <l n="57">And prove how slight each favour , else divine ,</l>
      <l n="58">If wroth the Urganda of the Golden Mine !</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="4">
      <l n="59">Now , as the houseless sate , and up the sky</l>
      <l n="60">Dawn to day strengthen 'd , pass 'd a stranger by :</l>
      <l n="61">He saw and halted ;— she beheld him not —</l>
      <l n="62">All round them slept , and silence wrapt the spot .</l>
      <l n="63">To this new-comer Nature had denied</l>
      <l n="64">The gifts that graced the outcast crouch 'd beside :</l>
      <l n="65">With orient suns his cheek was swarth and grim ,</l>
      <l n="66">And low the form , though lightly shaped the limb ;</l>
      <l n="67">Yet life glow 'd vigorous in that deep-set eye ,</l>
      <l n="68">With a calm force that dared you to defy ;</l>
      <l n="69">And the strong foot was planted on the stone</l>
      <l n="70">Firm as a gnome 's upon his mountain throne ;</l>
      <l n="71">Simple his garb , yet what the wealthy wear ,</l>
      <l n="72">And conscious power gave lordship to his air .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="5">
      <l n="73">Lone in the Babel thus the maid and man ;</l>
      <l n="74">Long he gazed silent , and at last began :</l>
      <l n="75">“ Poor homeless outcast — dost thou see me stand</l>
      <l n="76">Close by thy side , yet beg not ? Stretch thy hand . ”</l>
      <l n="77">The voice was stern , abrupt , yet full and deep :</l>
      <l n="78">The outcast heard , and started as from sleep ,</l>
      <l n="79">And meekly rose , and stretch 'd the hand and sought</l>
      <l n="80">To murmur thanks — the murmur fail 'd the thought .</l>
      <l n="81">He took the slight thin hand within his own :</l>
      <l n="82">“ This hand hath nought of honest labour known ;</l>
      <l n="83">And yet methinks thou'rt honest !— speak , my child . ”</l>
      <l n="84">And his face broke to beauty as it smiled .</l>
      <l n="85">But her unconscious eyes , cast down the while ,</l>
      <l n="86">Met not the heart that open 'd in the smile :</l>
      <l n="87">Again the murmur rose , and died in air .</l>
      <l n="88">“ Nay , what thy mother and her home , and where ? ”</l>
      <l n="89">Lo , with those words , the rigid ice that lay</l>
      <l n="90">Layer upon layer within , dissolves away ,</l>
      <l n="91">And tears come rushing from o'ercharged eyes :—</l>
      <l n="92">“ There is my mother — there her home — the skies ! ”</l>
      <l n="93">Oh , in that burst , what depth of lone distress !</l>
      <l n="94">O desolation of the motherless !</l>
      <l n="95">Yet through the anguish how survived the trust ,</l>
      <l n="96">Home in the skies , though in the grave the dust !</l>
      <l n="97">The man was moved , and silence fell again ;</l>
      <l n="98">Upsprung the sun — Light re-assumed the reign ;—</l>
      <l n="99">Love ruled on high ! Below , the twain that share</l>
      <l n="100">Men 's builded empires — Mammon and Despair !</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="6">
      <l n="101">At length , with pitying eye and soothing tone ,</l>
      <l n="102">The stranger spoke : “ Thy bitterer grief mine own ;</l>
      <l n="103">Amidst the million , lonely as thou art ,</l>
      <l n="104">Mine the full coffers , but the beggar 'd heart .</l>
      <l n="105">Yet Gold — earth 's demon , when unshared , receives</l>
      <l n="106">God 's breath , and grows a god , when it relieves .</l>
      <l n="107">Trust still our common Father , orphan one ,</l>
      <l n="108">And He shall guide thee , if thou trust the son .</l>
      <l n="109">Nay , follow , child . ” And on with passive feet ,</l>
      <l n="110">Ghost-like she follow 'd through the death-like street .</l>
      <l n="111">They paused at last a stately pile before ;</l>
      <l n="112">The drowsy porter oped the noiseless door ;</l>
      <l n="113">The girl stood wistful still without ;— the pause</l>
      <l n="114">The guide divined , and thus rebuked the cause :—</l>
      <l n="115">“ Enter , no tempter let thy penury fear ;</l>
      <l n="116">I have a sister , and her home is here . ”</l>
     </lg>

     <head>II .</head>
     <lg type="stanza" n="7">
      <l n="117">And who the wanderer that hath shelter won</l>
      <l n="118">Beneath the roof of Fortune 's favour 'd son ?</l>
      <l n="119">Ill stars predoom 'd her , and she stole to birth</l>
      <l n="120">Fresh from the Heaven ,— Law 's outcast on the earth ;</l>
      <l n="121">The child of Love betraying and betray 'd ,</l>
      <l n="122">The blossom open 'd in the Upas shade ;—</l>
      <l n="123">So ran the rumour ; if the rumour lied ,</l>
      <l n="124">The humble mother wept , but not denied :</l>
      <l n="125">Ne'er had the infant 's slumber known a rest</l>
      <l n="126">On childhood 's native shield — a father 's breast .</l>
      <l n="127">Dead or neglectful , ‘ twas to her the same ; }</l>
      <l n="128">But , oh , how dear !— yea , dearer for the shame , }</l>
      <l n="129">All that God hallows in a mother 's name ! }</l>
      <l n="130">Here , one proud refuge from a world 's disdain ,</l>
      <l n="131">Here the lost empress half resumes her reign ;—</l>
      <l n="132">Here the deep-fallen Eve sees Eden 's skies</l>
      <l n="133">Smile on the desert from the cherub 's eyes .</l>
      <l n="134">Sweet to each human heart the right to love ;</l>
      <l n="135">But ‘ tis the deluge consecrates the dove ;</l>
      <l n="136">And haply scorn yet more the child endears ,</l>
      <l n="137">Cradled in misery , and baptized with tears .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="8">
      <l n="138">Each then the all on earth unto the other ,—</l>
      <l n="139">The sinless infant and the erring mother :</l>
      <l n="140">The one soon lost the smile which childhood wears ,</l>
      <l n="141">Chill 'd by the gloom it marvels at — but shares ;</l>
      <l n="142">The other , by that purest love made pure ,</l>
      <l n="143">Learn 'd to redeem , by labouring to endure ;</l>
      <l n="144">Who can divine what hidden music lies</l>
      <l n="145">In the frail reed , till winds awake its sighs ?</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="9">
      <l n="146">Hard was their life , and lonely was their hearth ;</l>
      <l n="147">There , kindness brought no holiday of mirth ;</l>
      <l n="148">No kindred visited , no playmate came ;—</l>
      <l n="149">Joy , the proud worldling , shunn 'd the child of shame !</l>
      <l n="150">Yet in the lesson which , at stolen whiles ,</l>
      <l n="151">‘ Twixt care and care , the respite-hour beguiles ,</l>
      <l n="152">The mother 's mind the polish 'd trace betrays }</l>
      <l n="153">Of early culture and serener days ; }</l>
      <l n="154">And gentle birth still moulds the delicate phrase . }</l>
      <l n="155">By converse , more than books ( for books too poor ) ,</l>
      <l n="156">Learn 'd Lucy more than books themselves insure ;</l>
      <l n="157">For if , in truth , the mother 's heart had err 'd ,</l>
      <l n="158">Pure now the life , and holy was the word :</l>
      <l n="159">The fallen state no grov'ling change had wrought ;</l>
      <l n="160">Meek if the bearing , lofty was the thought ;</l>
      <l n="161">So much of noble in the lore instill 'd ,</l>
      <l n="162">You felt the soul had ne'er the error will 'd ;—</l>
      <l n="163">That fraud alone had duped its wings astray</l>
      <l n="164">From their true instinct tow'rds empyreal day .</l>
      <l n="165">Thus life itself , if sadd'ning , still refined ,</l>
      <l n="166">And through the heart the culture reach 'd the mind .</l>
      <l n="167">As to the moon the tides attracted move ,</l>
      <l n="168">So flow 'd the intellect beneath the love .—</l>
      <l n="169">To nurse the sickness , to assuage the care ,</l>
      <l n="170">To charm the sigh into the happier prayer ;</l>
      <l n="171">Forestall the unutter 'd wish with ready guess ;</l>
      <l n="172">Wise in the exquisite tact of tenderness !</l>
      <l n="173">These Lucy 's study ;— and , in grateful looks ,</l>
      <l n="174">Seraphs write lessons more divine than books .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="10">
      <l n="175">So dawn 'd her youth :— Youth , Nature 's holiday !</l>
      <l n="176">Fair time , which dreams so gently steal away ;</l>
      <l n="177">When Life — dark volume , with its opening leaf</l>
      <l n="178">Of Joy ,— through fable dupes us into grief —</l>
      <l n="179">Tells of a golden Arcady ;— and then</l>
      <l n="180">Read on ,— comes truth ;— the Iron world of men !</l>
      <l n="181">But from her life thy opening poet page</l>
      <l n="182">Was torn !— Its record had no Golden Age .</l>

      <l n="183">Behold her by the couch , on bended knees !</l>
      <l n="184">There the wan mother — there the last disease !</l>
      <l n="185">Dread to the poor the least suspense of health ,—</l>
      <l n="186">Their hands their friends , their labour all their wealth :</l>
      <l n="187">Let the wheel rest from toil a single sun ,</l>
      <l n="188">And all the humble clock-work is undone .</l>
      <l n="189">The custom lost , the drain upon the hoard ,</l>

   <p>[ V ] According to the exploded hypothesis of Voltaire , that the Gipsies are a Syrian tribe , the remains of the long scattered fraternity of Isis .</p>
   <p>[ W ] Whoever is well acquainted with the heathen learning must often have been deeply impressed with the mournful character of the mythological Elysium . Even the few admitted to the groves of asphodel , unpurified by death , retain the passions and pine with the griefs of life ; they envy the mortal whom the poet brings to their moody immortality ; and , amidst the disdained repose , sigh for the struggle and the storm .</p>
   <p>[ X ] Not only were the lofty and cheering notions of the soul , that were cherished by the more illustrious philosophers of Greece , confined to a few , but even the grosser and dimmer belief in a future state , which the vulgar mythology implied , was not entertained by the multitude . Plato remarked that few , even in his day , had faith in the immortality of the soul ; and indeed the Hades of the ancients was not for the Many . Amongst those condemned we find few criminals , except the old Titans , and such as imitated them in the one crime — blasphemy to the fabled gods : and the dwellers of Elysium are chiefly confined to the poets and the heroes , the oligarchy of earth .</p>
   <p>[ Y ] If a man wishes to leave a portion to his natural child , his lawyer will tell him to name the child as if it were a stranger to his blood . If he says , “ I leave to John Tompson , of Baker-street , L10 , 000 , ” John Tompson may probably get the legacy ; if he says , “ I leave to my son , John Tompson , of Baker-street , L10 , 000 , ” and the said John Tompson is his son ( a natural one ) , it is a hundred to one if John Tompson ever touches a penny ! Up springs the Inhuman Law , with its multiform obstacles , quibbles , and objections — proof of identity — evidence of birth !— Many and many a natural child has thus been robbed and swindled out of his sole claim upon redress — his sole chance of subsistence . In most civilised countries a father is permitted to own the offspring , whom , unless he do so , he has wronged at its very birth — whom , if he do not so , he wrongs irremedially ; with us the error is denied reparation , and the innocence is sentenced to outlawry . Our laws , with relation to illegitimate children , are more than unjust — they are inhuman .</p>

     <lg type="stanza" n="1">
      <l n="1">On Avon 's stream , in day 's declining hours ,</l>
      <l n="2">The loitering Angler sees reflected towers ;</l>
      <l n="3">Adown the hill the stately shadows glide ,</l>
      <l n="4">And force their frown upon the gentle tide :</l>
      <l n="5">Another shade , as stately and as slow ,</l>
      <l n="6">Steals down the slope and dims the peace below :</l>
      <l n="7">There , side by side , your noiseless shadows fall ,</l>
      <l n="8">Time-wearied Lord , and time-defying hall !</l>
      <l n="9">As Song 's sweet Master fled the roar of Rome ,</l>
      <l n="10">For the Bandusian fount and Sabine home ,</l>
      <l n="11">A soul forsook the beaten tracks of life ,</l>
      <l n="12">Sought the lone bye-path and escaped the strife ;</l>
      <l n="13">And paused , reviving ‘ mid the haunts of youth ,</l>
      <l n="14">To conjure fancies back , or muse on truth .</l>
      <l n="15">One home there is , from which , howe'er we stray ,</l>
      <l n="16">True as a star , the smile pursues our way ;</l>
      <l n="17">The home of thoughtful childhood 's mystic tears ,</l>
      <l n="18">Of earliest Sabbath bells on sinless ears ,</l>
      <l n="19">Of noonday dreamings under summer trees ,</l>
      <l n="20">And prayers first murmur 'd at a mother 's knees .</l>
      <l n="21">Ah ! happy he , whose later home as man</l>
      <l n="22">Is made where Love first spoke , and Hope began ,</l>
      <l n="23">Where haunted floors dear footsteps back can give ,</l>
      <l n="24">And in our Lares all our fathers live !</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="2">
      <l n="25">Graced with those gifts the vulgar mostly prize ,</l>
      <l n="26">And if used wisely , precious to the wise ,</l>
      <l n="27">Wealth and high lineage ;— Ruthven 's name was known</l>
      <l n="28">Less for ancestral greatness than its own :</l>
      <l n="29">With boyhood 's dreams the grand desire began</l>
      <l n="30">Which , nerved by labour , lifts from rank the man</l>
      <l n="31">Ev'n as the eye in Art 's majestic halls</l>
      <l n="32">Not on the frame but on the portrait falls ;</l>
      <l n="33">So to each nobler life the gaze we bound ,</l>
      <l n="34">Nor heed what casework clasps the picture round .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="3">
      <l n="35">But who can guess that crisis of the soul</l>
      <l n="36">When the old glory first forsakes the goal ?</l>
      <l n="37">When Knowledge halts and sees but cloud before ;</l>
      <l n="38">When sour 'd Experience whispers ‘ hope no more ; ’</l>
      <l n="39">When every onward footstep from our side</l>
      <l n="40">Parts the slow friend or hesitating guide ;</l>
      <l n="41">When envy rots the harvest in the sheaf ;</l>
      <l n="42">When faith in virtue seems the child 's belief ;</l>
      <l n="43">And life 's last music sighs itself away</l>
      <l n="44">On some false lip , that kiss 'd but to betray ?</l>
      <l n="45">Thus from a world that wrong 'd him , self-exiled ,</l>
      <l n="46">The man resought the birthplace of the child .</l>
      <l n="47">Rest comes betimes , if toil commence too soon ;</l>
      <l n="48">The brightest sun is stillest at the noon ;</l>
      <l n="49">Weary at mid-day , genius halts the course ,</l>

      <l n="51">Deep in the vale from which those towers arose ,</l>

      <l n="54">The unerring hierarch in thy temple , Trade .</l>
      <l n="55">Trade , the last earth-god ; whom the Olympian Power</l>
      <l n="56">Begot on Danae , as the Golden Shower ,</l>
      <l n="57">To whose young hands the weary Jove resign 'd .</l>
      <l n="58">Some ages since , the scales that weigh mankind .</l>
      <l n="59">But that dire Fate , who Jove himself controll 'd ,</l>
      <l n="60">Still shakes the urn , although the lots are gold :</l>
      <l n="61">Reverses came , the whirlwind of a day</l>
      <l n="62">Swept the strong labours of a life away ;</l>
      <l n="63">Rased out of sight whate'er is sold or bought ,</l>
      <l n="64">And left but name and honour — men said “ nought . ”</l>
      <l n="65">True , knavery whisper 'd , “ Only still disguise :</l>
      <l n="66">Credit is generous , if you blind its eyes ;</l>
      <l n="67">The borrow 'd prop arrests the house 's fall ,</l>
      <l n="68">And one rich chance may yet reconquer all . ”</l>
      <l n="69">There on his priest the earth-god lost control ,</l>
      <l n="70">And from the wreck the merchant saved his soul</l>
      <l n="71">“ Alone , I rose , ” he said ; “ I fall alone —</l>
      <l n="72">Nor one man 's ruin shall accuse mine own . ”</l>
      <l n="73">And so , life passing from the gorgeous stage ,</l>

      <l n="82">Through the sharp winter of the alter 'd skies .</l>
      <l n="83">Yet the soft child had memories unconfess 'd ,</l>
      <l n="84">And griefs that wept not on a father 's breast .</l>
      <l n="85">In brighter days , such love as fancy knows</l>
      <l n="86">( That youngest love whose couch is in the rose )</l>
      <l n="87">Had sent the shaft , which , when withdrawn in haste ,</l>

      <l n="89">But if it rest , more fatal grows the smart ,</l>
      <l n="90">And deepening from the surface , gains the heart ;</l>
      <l n="91">In truth , young Harcourt had the gifts that please ,—</l>
      <l n="92">Wit without effort , beauty worn with ease ;</l>
      <l n="93">The courtier 's mien to veil the miser 's soul ,</l>
      <l n="94">And that self-love which brings such self-control .</l>
      <l n="95">High-born , but poor , no Corydon was he</l>
      <l n="96">To dream of love and cots in Arcady ;</l>
      <l n="97">His tastes were like the Argonauts of old ,</l>
      <l n="98">And only pastoral if the fleece was gold .</l>
      <l n="99">The less men feel , the better they can feign —</l>
      <l n="100">To act a Romeo , needs it Romeo 's pain ?</l>
      <l n="101">No , the calm master of the Histrio 's art</l>
      <l n="102">Keeps his head coolest while he storms your heart ;</l>
      <l n="103">Thus , our true mime no boundary overstept ,</l>

      <l n="105">Meanwhile , what pass 'd the father had not guess 'd ,</l>

      <l n="107">Then prudence woke , and judgment , grown austere , }</l>
      <l n="108">Join 'd trade 's slow caution with affection 's fear , }</l>
      <l n="109">And whisper 'd this wise counsel — “ Wait a year ! ” }</l>
      <l n="110">In vain the lover pleaded to the maid ;</l>

      <l n="114">Cursed by a country which at times forgets</l>
      <l n="115">It boasts an empire where the sun ne'er sets ,</l>
      <l n="116">Some isle , resentful of our lax control ,</l>
      <l n="117">Rebels on purpose to distract his soul .</l>
      <l n="118">A month had scorch 'd him on that hateful shore ,</l>
      <l n="119">When paled those charms to which such faith he swore ;</l>
      <l n="120">News came that left to Constance not a grace ,</l>

      <l n="125">Yet still , fair Constance in her lone retreat</l>
      <l n="126">Cheer 'd the dull hours with faithful self-deceit ;</l>
      <l n="127">What though no tidings came to brighten time ,</l>
      <l n="128">To doubt of Harcourt seem 'd less grief than crime .</l>
      <l n="129">Easier to blame the elements unkind ,</l>
      <l n="130">The distant clime , the ocean , and the wind ,</l>
      <l n="131">Think them all leagued to intercept the scroll ,</l>
      <l n="132">Than place distrust where soul confides in soul .</l>
      <l n="133">But ever foremost in her wish was yet</l>
      <l n="134">To hide remembrance lest it seem 'd regret ;</l>
      <l n="135">That in her looks this comfort still might be ,</l>
      <l n="136">“ Father , I smile — and joy yet lives for thee ! ”</l>
      <l n="137">Thus Seaton deem 'd her childish fancy flown ;</l>
      <l n="138">To the worn mind fresh hearts are realms unknown ;</l>
      <l n="139">As we live on , the finer tints of truth</l>
      <l n="140">Fade from the landscape .— Age is blind to youth .</l>

   <p>MILTON .</p>
   <p>IN FOUR PARTS .</p>
   <p>ADVERTISEMENT TO THE READER .</p>
   <p>This Poem was originally composed in very early youth . It was first published in 1831 , and though unfortunately coupled with a very jejune and puerile burlesque called ‘ The Siamese Twins ’ ( which to my great satisfaction has been long since forgotten ) , it was honoured by a very complimentary notice in the Edinburgh Review , and found general favour with those who chanced to read it . In the present edition , although the conception and the general structure remain the same , many passages have been wholly re-written , and the diction throughout carefully revised , and often materially altered . I have sought , in short , from an affection for the subject ( too partial it may be ) to give to the ideas which visited me in the freshness of youth , whatever aid from expression they could obtain in the taste and culture of mature manhood . No doubt , however , faults of exuberance in form , as in fancy , still remain , and betray the age in which we scarcely look beyond the Spring that delights us , nor comprehend that the multitude of the blossoms can be injurious to the bearing of the tree . Nevertheless , such faults may find more indulgence among my younger readers than those of an opposite nature , incident to the style , closer and more compressed , which my present theories of verse have led me to adopt in most of the poems I have composed of late years .</p>
   <p>It will be observed that the design of this poem is that of a picture . It is intended to portray the great Patriot Poet in the three cardinal divisions of life — Youth , Manhood , and Age . The first part is founded upon the well-known , though ill-authenticated , tradition of the Italian lady or ladies seeing Milton asleep under a tree in the gardens of his college , and leaving some tributary verses beside the sleeper . Taking full advantage of this legend , and presuming to infer from Milton 's Italian verses ( as his biographers have done before me ) that in his tour through Italy he did not escape the influence of the master passion , I have ventured to connect , by a single thread of romantic fiction , the segments of a poem in which narrative after all is subservient to description . This idea belongs to the temerity of youth , but I trust it has been subjected to restrictions more reverent than those ordinarily imposed on poetic licence .</p>

     <l n="26">In storms that rent the heart was given ;</l>
     <l n="27">The peal that burst the clouds away</l>
     <l n="28">Left clear the face of heaven !</l>
     <l n="29">And wealth was his , and gentle birth ,</l>
     <l n="30">A form in fair proportions cast ;</l>
     <l n="31">But lonely still he walk 'd the earth —</l>
     <l n="32">The Hermit of the Past .</l>
     <l n="33">It was not love — that dream was o'er !</l>
     <l n="34">No stormy grief , no wild emotion ;</l>
     <l n="35">For oft , what once was love of yore ,</l>
     <l n="36">The memory soothes into devotion !</l>
     <l n="37">He bought the cot :— The garden flowers —</l>
     <l n="38">The haunts his Eva 's steps had trod ,</l>
     <l n="39">Books — thought — beguiled the lonely hours ,</l>
     <l n="40">That flow 'd in peaceful waves to God .</l>

    <head>FAREWELL TO THE BEAUTIFUL , WITHOUT .</head>
    <head>“ I was walking , some days after , in the new apartments of his palace . I recognized the approach of the cardinal ( Mazaria ) by the sound of his slippered feet , which he dragged one after the other , as a man enfeebled by a mortal malady . I concealed myself behind the tapestry , and I heard him say , ‘ Il faut quitter tout cela ! ’ ( ‘ I must leave all that ! ’ ) He stopped at every step , for he was very feeble , and casting his eyes on each object that attracted him , he sighed forth , as from the bottom of his heart , ‘ II faut quitter tout cela ! What pains have I taken to acquire these things ! Can I abandon them without regret ? I shall never see them more where I am about to go ! ’ ” &amp; c .— MEMOIRES INEDITS DE LOUIS HENRI , COMTE DE BRIENNE , Barriere 's Edition , vol . ii . p. 115 .</head>

    <head>MARY STUART AND HER MOURNER .</head>
    <head>“ Mary Stuart perished at the age of forty-four years and two months . Her remains were taken from her weeping servants , and a green cloth , torn in haste from an old billiard table , was flung over her once beautiful form . Thus it remained unwatched and unattended , except by a poor little lap-dog , which could not be induced to quit the body of its mistress . This faithful little animal was found dead two days afterwards ; and the circumstance made such an impression even on the hard-hearted minister of Elizabeth , that it was mentioned in the official despatches . ”</head>

    <head>CROMWELL 'S DREAM .</head>
    <head>The conception of this Ode originated in a popular tradition of Cromwell 's earlier days . It is thus strikingly related by Mr. Forster , in his very valuable Life of Cromwell :— “ He laid himself down , too fatigued in hope for sleep , when suddenly the curtains of his bed were slowly withdrawn by a gigantic figure , which bore the aspect of a woman , and which , gazing at him silently for a while , told him that he should , before his death , be the greatest man in England . He remembered when he told the story , and the recollection marked the current of his thoughts , that the figure had not made mention of the word King . ” Alteration has been made in the scene of the vision , and the age of Cromwell .</head>

      <l n="2">In the sharp whiteness of a wintry shroud ;</l>

      <l n="9">Paused and gazed round ; a dwarf 'd but aged yew</l>
      <l n="10">O'er the wan rime its gnome-like shadow threw ;</l>
      <l n="11">The spot invited , and by sleep oppress 'd ,</l>
      <l n="12">Beneath the boughs he laid him down to rest .</l>
      <l n="13">A man of stalwart limbs and hardy frame ,</l>

      <l n="18">Might warn the wise of danger in the smile ;</l>
      <l n="19">But the blunt aspect spoke more sternly still</l>
      <l n="20">That craft of craft — THE STUBBORN WILL :</l>
      <l n="21">That which ,— let what may betide —</l>
      <l n="22">Never halts nor swerves aside ;</l>

      <l n="25">Through maze , up mount , still hounding on its way ,</l>

   <p>KING ARTHUR .</p>
   <p>PREFACE .</p>
   <p>In prefixing to this poem a brief explanation of its design , I feel myself involuntarily compelled to refer to the more popular distinctions of Epic Fable , though I do not thereby presume to arrogate to my work that title of Epic which Time alone has the prerogative to confer .</p>
   <p>Pope has , accurately and succinctly , defined the three cardinal divisions of Epic Fable to consist in the Probable , the Allegorical , and the Marvellous . For the Probable is indispensable to the vital interest of the action , the Marvellous is the obvious domain of creative invention , and the Allegorical is the most pleasing mode of insinuating some subtler truth , or clothing some profounder moral .</p>
   <p>I accept these divisions , because they conform to the simplest principles of rational criticism ; and though their combination does not form an Epic , it serves at least to amplify the region and elevate the objects of Romance .</p>
   <p>It has been my aim so to blend these divisions , that each may harmonize with the other , and all conduce to the end proposed from the commencement . I have admitted but little episodical incident , and none that does not grow out of what Pope terms “ the platform of the story . ” For the marvellous agencies I have not presumed to make direct use of that Divine Machinery which the war of the Christian Principle with the form of Heathenism might have suggested to the sublime daring of Milton , had he prosecuted his original idea of founding an heroic poem upon the legendary existence of Arthur ;— and , on the other hand , the Teuton Mythology , however imaginative and profound , is too unfamiliar and obscure , to permit its employment as an open and visible agency ;— such reference to it as occurs , is therefore rather admitted as an appropriate colouring to the composition , than made an integral part of the materials of the canvas : and , not to ask from the ordinary reader an erudition I should have no right to expect , the reference so made is in the simplest form , and disentangled from the necessity of other information than a few brief notes will suffice to afford .</p>
   <p>In taking my subject from chivalrous romance , I take , then , those agencies from the Marvellous which chivalrous romance naturally and familiarly affords — the Fairy , the Genius , the Enchanter : not wholly , indeed , in the precise and literal spirit with which our nursery tales receive those creations of Fancy through the medium of French Fabliaux , but in the larger significations by which , in their conceptions of the Supernatural , our fathers often implied the secrets of Nature . For the Romance from which I borrow is the Romance of the North — a Romance , like the Northern mythology , full of typical meaning and latent import . The gigantic remains of symbol-worship are visible amidst the rude fables of the Scandinavians , and what little is left to us of the earlier and more indigenous literature of the Cymrians , is characterized by a mysticism profound with parable . This fondness for an interior or double meaning is the most prominent attribute in that Romance popularly called The Gothic , the feature most in common with all creations that bear the stamp of the Northern fancy : we trace it in the poems of the Anglo-Saxons ; it returns to us , in our earliest poems after the Conquest ; it does not originate in the Oriental genius ( immemorially addicted to Allegory ) , but it instinctively appropriates all that Saraconic invention can suggest to the more sombre imagination of the North — it unites to the Serpent of the Edda the flying Griffin of Arabia , the Persian Genius to the Scandinavian Trold ,— and wherever it accepts a marvel , it seeks to insinuate a type . This peculiarity , which distinguishes the spiritual essence of the modern from the sensual character of ancient poetry , especially the Roman , is visible wherever a tribe allied to the Goth , the Frank , or the Teuton , carries with it the deep mysteries of the Christian faith . Even in sunny Provence it transfuses a subtler and graver moral into the lays of the joyous troubadour , [ A ] — and weaves “ The Dance of Death ” by the joyous streams , and through the glowing orange-groves , of Spain . Onwards , this under-current of meaning flowed , through the various phases of civilization :— it pervaded alike the popular Satire and the dramatic Mystery ;— and , preserving its thoughtful calm amidst all the stirring passions that agitated mankind in the age subsequent to the Reformation , not only suffused the luxuriant fancy of the dreamy Spenser , but communicated to the practical intellect of Shakspere that subtle and recondite wisdom which seems the more inexhaustible the more it is examined , and suggests to every new inquirer some new problem in the philosophy of Human Life . Thus , in taking from Northern Romance the Marvellous , we are most faithful to the genuine character of that Romance , when we take with the Marvellous its old companion , the Typical or Allegorical . But these form only two divisions of the three which I have assumed as the components of the unity I seek to accomplish ; there remains the Probable , which contains the Actual . To subject the whole poem to allegorical constructions would be erroneous , and opposed to the vital principle of a work of this kind , which needs the support of direct and human interest . The inner and the outer meaning of Fable should flow together , each acting on the other , as the thought and the action in the life of a man . It is true that in order clearly to interpret the action , we should penetrate to the thought . But if we fail of that perception , the action , though less comprehended , still impresses its reality on our senses , and make its appeal to our interest .</p>
   <p>[ A ] Rien n'est plus commun dans la poesie provencale que l'allegorie ; seulement elle est un jeu-d'esprit an lieu d'etre une action .... Une autre analogie me parait plus spoutanee qu'imitee — la poesie des troubadours qu'on suppose frivole , a souvent retracee des sentiments graves et touchants , ” &amp; c .— VILLEMAIN , Tableau du Moyen Age .</p>
   <p>I have thus sought to maintain the Probable through that chain of incident in which human agencies are employed , and through those agencies the direct action of the Poem is accomplished ; while the Allegorical admits into the Marvellous the introduction of that subtler form of Truth , which if less positive than the Actual , is wider in its application , and ought to be more profound in its significance .</p>
   <p>For the rest , it may perhaps be conceded that this poem is not without originality in the conception of its plot and the general treatment of its details . I am not aware of any previous romantic poem which it resembles in its main design , or in the character of its principal incidents ;— and , though I may have incurred certain mannerisms of my own day , I yet venture to trust that , in the pervading form or style , the mind employed has been sufficiently in earnest to leave its own peculiar effigy and stamp upon the work . For the incidents narrated , I may , indeed , thank the nature of my subject , if many of them could scarcely fail to be new . The celebrated poets of chivalrous fable — Ariosto , Tasso , and Spenser , have given to their scenery the colourings of the West . The Great North from which Chivalry sprung — its polar seas , its natural wonders , its wild legends , its antediluvian remains — ( wide fields for poetic description and heroic narrative ) — have been , indeed , not wholly unexplored by poetry , but so little appropriated , that even after Tegner and Oehlenschlaeger , I dare to hope that I have found tracks in which no poet has preceded me , and over which yet breathes the native air of our National Romance .</p>
   <p>For the Manners preserved through this poem , I naturally reject those which the rigid Antiquary would appropriate to the date of that Historical Arthur , of whom we know so little , and take those of the age in which the Arthur of Romance , whom we know so well , revived into fairer life at the breath of Minstrel and Fabliast . The anachronism of chivalrous manners and costume for the British chief and his Knighthood , is absolutely required by all our familiar associations . On the other hand , without affecting any precise accuracy in details , I have kept the country of the brave Prince of the Silures ( or South Wales ) somewhat more definitely in view , than has been done by the French Romance writers ; while in portraying his Saxon foes , I have endeavoured to distinguish their separate nationality , without enforcing too violent a contrast between the rudeness of the heathen Teutons and the polished Christianity of the Cymrian Knighthood . [ B ]</p>
   <p>[ B ] In the more historical view of the position of Arthur , I have , however , represented it such as it really appears to have been ,— not as the sovereign of all Britain , and the conquering invader of Europe ( according to the groundless fable of Geoffrey of Monmouth ) , but as the patriot Prince of South Wales , resisting successfully the invasion of his own native soil , and accomplishing the object of his career in preserving entire the nationality of his Welsh countrymen . In thus contracting his sphere of action to the bounds of rational truth , his dignity , both moral and poetic , is obviously enhanced . Represented as the champion of all Britain against the Saxons , his life would have been but a notorious and signal failure ; but as the preserver of the Cymrian Nationality — of that part of the British population which took refuge in Wales , he has a claim to the epic glory of success .</p>
   <p>It is for this latter reason that I have gone somewhat out of the strict letter of history , in the poetical licence by which the Mercians are represented as Arthur 's principal enemies ( though , properly speaking , the Mercian kingdom was not then founded ): the alliance between the Mercian and the Welsh , which concludes the Poem — is at least not contrary to the spirit of History — since in very early periods such amicable bonds between the Welsh and the Mercians were contracted , and the Welsh , on the whole , were on better terms with those formidable borderers than with the other branches of the Saxon family .</p>
   <p>May I be permitted to say a word as to the metre I have selected ?— One advantage it has ,— that while thoroughly English , and not uncultivated by the best of the elder masters , it has never been applied to a poem of equal length , and has not been made too trite and familiar , by the lavish employment of recent writers . [ C ] Shakspere has taught us its riches in the Venus and Adonis ,— Spenser in The Astrophel ,— Cowley has sounded its music amidst the various intonations of his irregular lyre . But of late years , if not wholly laid aside , it has been generally neglected for the more artificial and complicated Spenserian stanza , which may seem , at the first glance , to resemble it , but which to the ear is widely different in rhythm and construction .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">[ C ] Southey has used it in the “ Lay of the Laureate ” and “ The Poet 's</l>
     <l n="2">Pilgrimage , ” — not his best-known and most considerable poems .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The reader may perhaps remember that Dryden has spoken with emphatic praise of the “ quatrain , or stanza of four in alternate rhyme . ” He says indeed , “ that he had ever judged it more noble , and of greater dignity , both for the sound and number , than any other verse in use amongst us . ” That metre , in its simple integrity , is comprised in the stanza selected , ending in the vigour and terseness of the rhyming couplet , with which , for the most part , the picture should be closed or the sense clenched . And whatever the imperfection of my own treatment of this variety in poetic form , I hazard a prediction that it will be ultimately revived into more frequent use , especially in narrative , and that its peculiar melodies of rhythm and cadence , as well as the just and measured facilities it affords to expression , neither too diffuse nor too restricted , will be recognized hereafter in the hands of a more accomplished master of our language .</p>
   <p>Here ends all that I feel called upon to say respecting a Poem which I now acknowledge as the child of my most cherished hopes , and to which I deliberately confide the task to uphold , and the chance to continue , its father 's name .</p>
   <p>To this work , conceived first in the enthusiasm of youth , I have patiently devoted the best powers of my maturer years ;— if it be worthless , it is at least the worthiest contribution that my abilities enable me to offer to the literature of my country ; and I am unalterably convinced , that on this foundation I rest the least perishable monument of those thoughts and those labours which have made the life of my life .</p>
   <p>E. BULWER LYTTON .</p>
   <p>NOTE .</p>
   <p>Of the notes inserted in the first edition I have retained only those which appeared to me absolutely necessary in explanation of the text . Among the notes omitted , was one appended to Book I ., which defended at some length , and by numerous examples , two alleged peculiarities of style or mannerism :— I content myself here with stating briefly —</p>
   <p>1st .— That in this work ( as in my later ones generally ) I have adopted what appears to me to have been the practice of Gray ( judging from the editions of his Poems revised by himself ) , in the use of the capital initial . I prefix it —</p>
   <p>First , to every substantive that implies a personification ; thus War , Fame , &amp; c , may in one line take the small initial as mere nouns , and in another line the capital initial , to denote that they are intended as personifications . This rule is clear — all personifications may be said to represent proper names : love , with a small l , means but a passion or affection ; with a large L , Love represents some mythological power that presides over the passion or affection , and is as much a proper name as Venus , Eros , Camdeo , &amp; c .</p>
   <p>Secondly , I prefix the capital in those rare instances in which an adjective is used as a noun ; as the Unknown , the Obscure , [ D ] &amp; c. The capital here but answers the use of all printed inventions , in simplifying to the reader the author 's meaning . If it be printed “ he passed through the obscure , ” the reader naturally looks for the noun that is to follow the adjective ; if the capital initial be used , as “ He passed through the Obscure , ” the eye conveys to the mind without an effort the author 's intention to use the adjective as a substantive .</p>
   <p>[ D ] So Pope , “ Spencer himself affects the Obsolete . ”</p>
   <p>Thirdly , I prefix the capital initial where it serves to give an individual application to words that might otherwise convey only a general meaning ; for instance —</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ Or his who loves the madding Nymphs to lead</l>
     <l n="2">O'er the Fork 'd Hill .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">that is , the Forked Hill , par emphasis ,— Parnassus .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>The use of the capital in these instances seems to me warranted by common sense , and the best authorities in the minor niceties of our language .</p>
   <p>With regard to the other point referred to in the omitted note , I would observe , that I have deliberately used the freest licence in the rapid change of tense from past to present , or vice versa ; as a privilege essential to all ease , spirit , force , and variety , in narrative poetry ; and warranted by the uniform practice of Pope , Dryden , and Milton .

   <p>[ E ] In the corrupt and thoughtless mode of printing now in vogue , Power is of course printed with a small p , and the sense of the clearest of all English poets instantly becomes obscure .</p>
   <p>“ The vigorous power the trembling car ascends . ”</p>
   <p>It is not till one has read the line twice over that one perceives “ the power ” means “ the God , ” which , when printed “ the Power , ” is obvious at a glance .</p>
   <p>I ask indulgence of the reader if I take this occasion to add a very short comment upon three objections to this poem which have been brought under my notice :—</p>
   <p>1 — that it contains too much learning ; 2 — that it abounds too much with classical allusions ; 3 — that it indulges in rare words or archaisms .</p>
   <p>I wish I could plead guilty to the honourable charge that it contains too much learning . A distinguished critic has justly observed , that the greatest obstacle which the modern writer attempting an Epic would have to encounter , would be , in his utter impossibility to attain the requisite learning . For an Epic ought to embody the whole learning of the period in which it is composed ; and in the present age that is beyond the aspiration of the most erudite scholar or the profoundest philosopher . Still , any attempt at an Heroic Poem must at least comprise all the knowledge which the nature of the subject will admit , and we cannot but observe that the greatest narrative poems are those in which the greatest amount of learning is contained . Beyond all comparison the most learned poems that exist , in reference to the age in which they are composed , are the “ Iliad ” and “ Odyssey ; ” next to them , the “ Paradise Lost ; ” next to that , the “ AEneid , ” in which the chief charm of the six latter books is in that “ exquisite erudition , ” which Mueller so discriminately admires in Virgil ; and after these , in point of learning , come perhaps the “ Divine Comedy , ” and the “ Fairy Queen . ” So that I have only to regret my deficiency of learning , rather than to apologize for the excess of it .</p>
   <p>With regard to the classical allusions which I have permitted myself , I might shelter my practice under the mantles of our great masters in heroic song — Milton and Spenser ; but in fact such admixture of the Classic with the Gothic muse is so essentially the characteristic of the minstrelsy of the middle ages , that without a liberal use of the same combination , I could not have preserved the colouring proper to my subject . And , indeed , I think the advice which one of the most elegant of modern critics has given to the painter , is equally applicable to the poet :—</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ Non te igitur lateant antiqua numismata , gemmae ,</l>
     <l n="2">Quodque refert specie veterum post saecula mentem ;</l>
     <l n="3">Splendidior quippe ex illis assurgit imago</l>
     <l n="4">Magnaque se rerum facies aperit meditanti . "[ F ]</l>

    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Lastly , the moderate use of archaisms has always been deemed admissible in a narrative poem of some length , and rather perhaps an ornament than a defect , where the action of the poem is laid in remote antiquity . And I may add that not only the revival of old , but the invention of new words , if sparingly resorted to , is among the least contestable of poetic licences — a licence freely recognized by Horace , elaborately maintained by Dryden , and tacitly sanctioned , age after age , by the practice of every poet by whom our language has been enriched . I have certainly not abused either of these privileges , for while I have only adopted three new words of foreign derivation , I do not think there are a dozen words in the whole poem which can be considered archaisms : and in the three or four instances in which such words are not to be found in Milton , Shakspere , or Spenser , they are taken from the Saxon element of our language , and are still popularly used in the northern parts of the island , in which that Saxon element is more tenaciously preserved .</p>
   <p>If these matters do not seem to the reader of much importance , in reference to a poem of this design and extent , I will own to him confidentially , that I incline to his opinion . But I have met with no objections to the general composition of this work , more serious than those to which the above remarks are intended to reply . Some objections to special lines or stanzas which appeared to me prompted by a juster criticism , or which occurred to myself in reperusal , I have carefully endeavoured in this edition to remove .</p>

   <p>The Carduel of the FABLIAUX is not easily ascertained : it is here identified with Caerleon on the Usk , the favourite residence of Arthur , according to the Welch poets . This must have been a city of no ordinary splendour in the supposed age of Arthur , while still fresh from the hands of the Roman ; since , so late as the twelfth century , Giraldus Cambrensis , in his well-known description , speaks as an eye-witness of the many vestiges of its former splendour . “ Immense palaces , ornamented with gilded roofs , in imitation of Roman magnificence , a tower of prodigious size , remarkable hot baths , relics of temples , ” &amp; c. ( Giraldus Cambrensis , Sir R. Hoare 's translation , vol . i. p . 103 . ) Geoffrey of Monmouth ( 1. ix . c. 12 ) also mentions , admiringly , the gilt roofs of Caerleon , a subject on which he might be a little more accurate than in those other details in his notable chronicle , not drawn from the same ocular experience . The luxurious Romans , indeed , had bequeathed to the chiefs of Britain abodes of splendour and habits of refinement which had no parallel in the Saxon domination . Sir F. Palgrave truly remarks , that even in the fourteenth century the edifices raised in Britain by the Romans were so numerous and costly as almost to excel any others on this side of the Alps . Caerleon ( Isca Augusta ) was the Roman capital of Siluria , the garrison of the renowned Second or Augustan legion , and the Palatian residence of the Praetor . It was not , however , according to national authority , founded by the Romans , but by the mythical Belin Mawr , three centuries before Caesar 's invasion . It is scarcely necessary to observe , that the dragon was the standard of the Cymry ( a word , by the way , which I trust my Welch readers will forgive me for spelling Cymri ) .</p>

   <p>9 .— Page 212 , stanza lxxvii .</p>
   <p>Which HEUS , the Guardian , taught the Celt to wield .</p>
   <p>HEUS is the same deity as ESUS , or HESUS , mentioned in Lucan , the Mars of the Celts . According to the Welch triads , HEUS ( or HU — Hu Gadarn ; i. e. the mighty Guardian , or Inspector ) brought the people of Cymry first into this isle , from the summer country called Defrobanni ( in the Tauric Chersonese ) , over the Hazy Sea ( the German Ocean ) . Davies , in his Celtic Researches , observes that some commentator , at least as old as the twelfth century , repeatedly explains the situation of Defrobanni as “ that on which Constantinople now stands . ” “ This comment , ” adds Davies , “ would not have been made without some authority ; it belongs to an age which possessed many documents relating to the history of the Britons which are now no longer extant . ”</p>
   <p>It would be extremely important towards tracing the origin of the Cymry , if authentic and indisputable records of such traditions of their migration from the East can be found in their own legends at an age before learned conjecture could avail itself of the passages in Herodotus and Strabo , which relate to the Cimmerians , and tend to identify that people with our Cymrian ancestors . We find in the first ( 1. i. c. 14 ) , that the Cimmerians , chased from their original settlements by the Nomadic Scythians , came to Lydia , where they took Sardis ( except the citadel ) . In this account Strabo , on the authority of Callisthenes and Callinus , confirms Herodotus .</p>
   <p>In flying from their Scythian foes , the Cimmerians took their course by the sea-coasts to Sinope , and the Cimmerian Bosphorus , and as , after this flight , the old Cimmerian league was broken up , and the tribes dispersed , this gives us the evident date for such migrations as Hu Gadarn is supposed to head ; and the coincidence between Welch traditions ( if genuinely ancient ) and classical authority becomes very remarkable . For the additional corroboration of the hypothesis thus suggested , which is afforded by the identity between the Cimmerians of Asia and the Cimbri of Gaul , see Strabo ( 1. vii . p. 424 , the Oxford edition , 1807 ) . It is curious to note in Herodotus ( 1. iv . c. 11 ) that the same domestic feuds which destroyed the Cymrian empire in Britain destroyed the Cimmerians in their original home . While the Scythians invaded them , they quarrelled amongst themselves whether to fight or fly , and settled the dispute by fighting each other , and flying from the enemy .</p>

   <p>Some liberty , in the course of this poem , will be taken with the legendary character , less perhaps of the Gawaine of the Fabliaux , than of the Gwalchmai ( Hawk of Battle ) of the Welch bards . In both , indeed , this hero is represented as sage , courteous , and eloquent ; but he is a livelier character in the Fabliaux than in the tales of his native land . The characters of many of the Cymrian heroes , indeed , vary according to the caprice of the poets . Thus Kai , in the Triads , one of the Three Diademed chiefs of battle and a powerful magician , is , in the French romances , Messire Queux , the chief of the cooks ; and in the Mabinogion , [ A ] he is at one time but an unlucky knight of more valour than discretion , and at another time attains the dignity assigned to him in the Triads , and exults in supernatural attributes . And poor Gawaine himself , the mirror of chivalry , in most of the Fabliaux is , as Southey observes , “ shamefully calumniated ” in the MORT D'ARTHUR as the “ false Gawaine . ” The Caradoc of this poem is not intended to be identified with the hero Caradoc Vreichvras . The name was sufficiently common in Britain ( it is the right reading for Caractacus ) to allow to the use of the poet as many Caradocs as he pleases .</p>

May was his consecrated month . The rocking-stones which mark these sanctuaries were called amber-stones .</p>

   <p>Caradoc 's version of the descent of Brut differs somewhat from that of Geoffrey of Monmouth , but perhaps it is quite as true . According to Geoffrey , Brut is great-grandson to AEneas , and therefore not expelled from “ flaming Troy . ” Caradoc follows his own ( no doubt authentic ) legends , also , as to the aboriginal population of the island , which , according to Geoffrey , were giants , not devils . The cursory and contemptuous way in which that delicious romance-writer speaks of these poor giants is inimitable — “ Albion a nemine , exceptis paucis gigantibus , inhabitabatur . ” — “ Albion was inhabited by nobody — except , indeed , a few giants ! ”</p>

    <head>ARGUMENT .</head>
    <head>Arthur still sleeps — The sounds that break his rest — The war between the beast and the man — How ended — The Christian foe and the heathen — The narrative returns to the Saxons in pursuit of Arthur — Their chase is stayed by the caverns described in the preceding book , the tides having now advanced up the gorge through which Arthur passed , and blocked that pathway — The hunt is resumed at dawn — The tides have receded from the gorge — One of the hounds finds scent — The riders are on the track — Harold heads the pursuit — The beech-tree — The man by the water spring — The wood is left — The knight on the brow of the hill — Parley between the earl and the knight — The encounter — Harold 's address to his men , and his foe — His foe 's reply — The dove and the falcon — The unexpected succour — And conclusion of the fray — The narrative passes on to the description of the Happy Valley — in which the dwellers await the coming of a stranger — History of the Happy Valley — a colony founded by Etrurians from Fiesole , forewarned of the destined growth of the Roman dominion — Its strange seclusion and safety from the changes of the ancient world — The law that forbade the daughters of the Lartian or ruling family to marry into other clans — Only one daughter ( the queen ) is left now , and the male line in the whole Lartian clan is extinct — The contrivance of the Augur for the continuance of the royal house , sanctioned by two former precedents — A stranger is to be lured into the valley — The simple dwellers therein to be deceived into believing him a god — He is to be married to the queen , and then , on the birth of a son , to vanish again amongst the gods ( i. e . to be secretly made away with ) — Two temples at the opposite ends of the valley give the only gates to the place — By the first , dedicated to Tina ( the Etrurian Jove ) , the stranger is to be admitted — In the second , dedicated to Mantu ( the god of the shades ) , he is destined to vanish — Such a stranger is now expected in the Happy Valley — He emerges , led by the Augur , from the temple of Tina — AEgle , the queen , described — Her stranger-bridegroom is led to her bower .</head>

     <l n="1">A wise Etrurian chief , forewarn 'd ( ‘ twas said )</l>
     <l n="2">By his dark Caere , from the danger fled .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Caere of the twelve cities in the Etrurian league ( though not originally an Etrurian population ) , imparted to the Romans their sacred mysteries : hence the word Caeremonia . This holy city was in close connection with Delphi . An interesting account of it under its earlier name “ Agylla , ” will be found in Sir W. Gell 's “ Topography of Rome and its vicinity . ” The obscure passage in Plutarch 's life of Sylla , which intimates that the Etrurian soothsayers had a forewarning of the declining fates of their country , is well known to scholars ; who have made more of it than it deserves .</p>
   <p>I may as well observe that the adjective Lartian is derived from Lars ( or lord ) , in contradistinction to the adjective Larian derived from Lar ( or household god ) .</p>

     <l n="1">His rod the Augur waves above the ground ,</l>
     <l n="2">And cries , “ In Tina 's name I bless the soil . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Tina was the Jove of the Etrurians . The mode in which this people ( whose mysterious civilization so tasks our fancy and so escapes from our researches ) appropriated a colony , is briefly described in the text . The Augur made lines in the air due north , south , east , and west , marked where the lines crossed upon the earth ; then he and the chiefs associated with him sate down , covered their heads , and waited some approving omen from the gods . The Etrurian Augurs were celebrated for their power over the electric fluid . The vulture was a popular bird of omen in the founding of colonies . See NIEBUHR , MULLER , &amp; c .</p>

   <p>The Hister 's lyre still thrill 'd with Camsee 's lays .</p>
   <p>Hister , the Etruscan minstrel .— CAMSEE , CAMESE , or CAMOESE , the mythological sister of Janus ( a national deity of the Etrurians ) , whose art of song is supposed to identify her with the Camoena or muse of the Latin poets .— ARRETIUM , celebrated for the material of the Etruscan vases .</p>
   <p>12 .— Page 249 , stanza xciii .</p>
   <p>and all the honours of the race Lend their last bloom to smile in AEgle 's face .</p>
   <p>The Etrurians paid more respect to women than most of the classical nations , and admitted females to the throne . The Augur ( a purely Etruscan name and office ) was the highest power in the state . In the earlier Etruscan history , the Augur and the king were unquestionably united in one person . Latterly , this does not appear to have been necessarily ( nor perhaps generally ) the case . The king ( whether we call him lars or lucumo ) , as well as the augur , was elected out of a certain tribe , or clan ; but in the strange colony described in the poem , it is supposed that the rank has become hereditary in the family of the chief who headed it , as would probably have been the case even in more common-place settlements in another soil . Thus , the first Etrurian colonist , Tarchun , no doubt had his successors in his own lineage .</p>
   <p>I cannot assert that AEgle is a purely Etruscan name ; it is one common both with the Greeks and Latins . In Apollodorus ( ii . 5 ) it is given to one of the Hesperides , and in Virgil ( Eclog . vi . l. 20 ) to the fairest of the Naiads , the daughter of the sun ; but it is not contrary to the conformation of the Etruscan language , as , by the way , many of the most popular Latinized Etruscan words are , such as Lucumo , for Lauchme ; and even Porsena , or , as Virgil ( contrary to other authorities ) spells and pronounces it , Pors [~ e ] nna ( a name which has revived to fresh fame in Mr. Macaulay 's noble “ Lays ” ) is a sad corruption ; for , as both Niebuhr and Sir William G. remark , the Etruscans had no o in their language . Pliny informs us that they supplied its place by the v. I apprehend that an Etrurian would have spelt Porsena Pvrsna . [ B ]</p>
   <p>13 .— Page 250 , stanza xcvii .</p>
   <p>The Gods had care of their Tagetian child !</p>
   <p>Tages — the tutelary genius of the Etrurians . They had a noble legend that Tages appeared to Tarchun , rising from a furrow beneath his plough , with a man 's head and a child 's body ; sung the laws destined to regulate the Etrurian colonist , then sunk , and expired . In Ovid 's Metamorphoses ( xvi . 533 ) Tages is said to have first taught the Etrurians to foretell the future .</p>

   <p>Whatever the original cradle of the mysterious Etrurians , scholars , with one or two illustrious exceptions , are pretty well agreed that it must have been somewhere in the East ; and the more familiar we become with the remains of their art , the stronger appears the evidence of their early and intimate connection with the Egyptians , though in themselves a race decidedly not Egyptian . See MICALI , Stor . deg . Antich . Pop . But in referring to this delightful and learned writer , to whom I am under many obligations in this part of my poem , I must own , with such frankness as respect for so great an authority will permit , that I think many of his assumptions are to be taken with great qualification and reserve .</p>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="2">Like that in which the far SARONIDES .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Saronides — the Druids of Gaul : “ The Samian Sage ” — PYTHAGORAS .. The Augur is here supposed to speak Phoenician as the parent language of Arthur 's native Celtic . See note 2 .</p>
   <p>2 .— Page 255 , stanza xi .</p>
   <p>Exchanged dark riddles with the Samian sage .</p>
   <p>Diodorus Siculus speaks with great respect of the SARONIDES as the Druid priests of Gaul ; and Mr. Davis , in his Celtic Researches , insists upon it that Saronides is a British word , compounded from ser , stars ; and honydd , “ one who discriminates or points out : ” in fine , according to him , the Saronides are Seronyddion , i. e. astronomers . For the initiation of Pythagoras into the Druid mysteries , see CLEM . ALEX . Strom . L. i. Ex . Alex . Polyhist . It will be observed that the author here takes advantage of the well-known assertions of many erudite authorities that the Phoenician language is the parent of the Celtic , in order to obtain a channel of oral communication between Arthur and the Etrurian ; [ C ] though , contented with those authorities , as sufficing for all poetic purpose , he prudently declines entering into a controversy equally abstruse and interminable , as to the affinity between the countrymen of Dido and the scattered remnants of the Briton . It is not surprising that the Augur should know Phoenician , for we have only to suppose that he maintained , as well as he could in his retreat , the knowledge common among his priestly forefathers . The intercourse between Etruria and the Phoenician states ( especially Carthage ) was too considerable not to have rendered the language of the last familiar to the learning of the first ;— to say nothing of those more disputable affinities of origin and religion , which , if existing , would have made an acquaintance with Phoenicia necessary to the solution of their historical chronicles and sacred books . Nor , when the Augur afterwards assures Arthur that AEgle also understands Phoenician , is any extravagant demand made upon the credulity of the indulgent reader ; for , those who have consulted such lights as research has thrown upon Etrurian records , are aware that their more high-born women appear to have received no ordinary mental cultivation .</p>

   </lg>
   <p>Northia , the Etrurian deity which corresponds with the FORTUNE of the Romans , but probably with something more of the sterner attributes which the Greek and the Scandinavian gave to the FATES . I cannot but observe here on the similarity in sound and signification between the Etrurian Northia and the Norna of the Scandinavians . Norna with the last is the general term applied to Fate . The Etrurian name for the deities collectively — AESARS , is not dissimilar to that given collectively to their deities by the Scandinavians ; viz . AESIR , or ASAS .</p>

    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>It is clear that all which the bewildered Augur could comprehend , in the theological relations by which Arthur ( no doubt with equal glibness and obscurity ) relieves his historical narrative , would be that , in “ worsting Satan , ” the Emperor of Greece is demolishing the Typhon worship of the Egyptians , and enforcing the adoration of the Dorian Apollo — that deity who had passed a probation on earth , and expiated a mysterious sin by descending to the shades ; and it would require a more erudite teacher than we can presume Arthur to be , before the Augur would cease to confuse with the Pagan divinity the Divine Founder of the Christian gospel .</p>

   <p>[ C ] It may perhaps occur to the reader that Latin , with which Arthur ( in an age so shortly subsequent to the Roman occupation of Britain ) could scarcely fail to be well acquainted , might have furnished a better mode of communication between himself and the Augur . But the Latin language would have been very imperfectly settled at the time of the supposed Etrurian emigration ; would have had small connection with the literature , sacred or profane , of the Etrurians ; and would long have been despised as a rude medley of various tongues and dialects , by the proud and polished race which the Romans subjected .</p>

   <p>If the celebrated controversy between Black and White , which divided the Cymrian church in King Arthur 's days , should seem to suggest a parallel instance in our own ,— the Author begs sincerely to say that he is more inclined to grieve than to jest at a schism which threatens to separate from so large a body of the upholders of the English church the abilities and learning of no despicable portion of the English clergy . There is a division more dangerous than that between theologian and theologian — viz ., a division between the Pastors and their flocks — between the teaching of the pulpit and the sympathy of the audience . Far from the Author be the rash presumption to hazard any opinion as to matters of doctrine , on which — such as Regeneration by Baptism — it cannot be expected that , for the sake of expediency or even concord , the remarkable thinkers who have emerged from the schools of Oxford should admit of compromise ;— but he asks , with the respect due to zeal and erudition , whether it be worth while to inflame dispute , and risk congregations — for the colour of a gown ?</p>

    <head>Arthur and the Lady of the Lake — They land on the Meteor Isle — which then sinks to the Halls below — Arthur beholds the Forest springing from a single stem — He tells his errand to the Phantom , and rejects the fruits that It proffers him in lieu of the Sword — He is conducted by the Phantom to the entrance of the caves , through which he must pass alone — He reaches the Coral Hall of the Three Kings — The Statue crowned with thorns — The Asps and the Vulture , and the Diamond Sword — The choice of the Three Arches — He turns from the first and second arch , and beholds himself , in the third , a corpse — The sleeping King rises at Arthur 's question — “ if his death shall be in vain ? ” — The Vision of times to be — Coeur de Lion and the age of Chivalry — The Tudors — Henry VII .— the restorer of the line of Arthur and the founder of civil Freedom — Henry VIII . and the Revolution of Thought — Elizabeth and the Age of Poetry — The union of Cymrian and Saxon , under the sway of “ Crowned Liberty ” — Arthur makes his choice , and attempts , but in vain , to draw the Sword from the Rock — The Statue with the thorn-wreath addresses him — Arthur called upon to sacrifice the Dove — His reply — The glimpse of Heaven — The trance which succeeds , and in which the King is borne to the sea shores .</head>

   <p>The testimony to be found in classical writers as to the original purity of the Druid worship , before it was corrupted into the idolatry which existed in Britain at the time of the Roman conquest , is strongly corroborated by the Welsh triads . These triads , indeed , are of various dates , but some bear the mark of a very remote antiquity — wholly distinct alike from the philosophy of the Romans and the mode of thought prevalent in the earlier ages of the Christian era ; in short , anterior to all the recorded conquests over the Cymrian people . These , like proverbs , appear the wrecks and fragments of some primaeval ethics , or philosophical religion . Nor are such remarkable alone for the purity of the notions they inculcate relative to the Deity ; they have often , upon matters less spiritual , the delicate observation , as well as the profound thought , of reflective wisdom . It is easy to see in them how identified was the Bard with the Sage — that rare union which produces the highest kind of human knowledge . Such , perhaps , are the relics of that sublimer learning which , ages before the sacrifice of victims in wicker idols , won for the Druids the admiration of the cautious Aristotle , as ranking among the true enlighteners of men — such the teachers who ( we may suppose to have ) instructed the mystical Pythagoras ; and furnished new themes for meditation to the musing Brahman . Nor were the Druids of Britain inferior to those with whom the Sages of the western and eastern world came more in contact . On the contrary , even to the time of Caesar , the Druids of Britain excelled in science and repute those in Gaul ; and to their schools the Neophytes of the Continent were sent .</p>
   <p>In the Stanzas that follow the description of the more primitive Cymrians , it is assumed that the rude Druid remains now existent ( as at Stonehenge , &amp; c .) , are coeval only with the later and corrupted state of a people degenerated to idol-worship , and that the Cymrians previously possessed an architecture , of which no trace now remains , more suited to their early civilization . If it be true that they worshipped the Deity only in his own works , and that it was not until what had been a symbol passed into an idol , that they deserted the mountain-top and the forest for the temple , they would certainly have wanted the main inducement to permanent and lofty architecture . Still it may be allowed , at least to a poet , to suppose that men so sensible as the primitive Saronides , would have held their schools and colleges in places more adapted to a northern climate than their favourite oak groves .</p>

   <p>The sublime idea of the nonentity of death , of the instantaneous transit of the soul from one phase and cycle of being to another , is earnestly insisted upon by the early Cymrian bards , in terms which seem borrowed from some spiritual belief anterior to that which does in truth teach that the life of man once begun , has not only no end , but no pause — and , in the triumphal cry of the Christian , “ O grave , where is thy victory ! ” — annihilates death .</p>

   <p>12 .— Page 439 , stanza cxciv .</p>
   <p>Thy dauntless blood through Gwynedd 's chiefs shall roll .</p>
   <p>This prediction refers to the marriage of the daughter of Griffith ap Llewellyn ( Prince of Gwynedd , or North Wales , whose name and fate are not unfamiliar to those who have read the romance of “ Harold , the last of the Saxon Kings ” ) with Fleance . From that marriage descended the Stuarts , and indeed the reigning family of Great Britain .</p>

     <l n="1">From Cymri 's Dragon England 's power shall date ,</l>

   </lg>
   <p>According to Welch genealogists , Arthur left no son : and I must therefore invite the believer in Merlin 's prophecy to suppose that it was by a daughter that Arthur 's line was continued , and the royalty of Britain restored to the Cymrian kings , through the House of Tudor ; from the accession of which House may indeed be dated both the final and cordial amalgamation of the Welch with the English , and the rise of that power over the destinies of the civilized world , which England has since established . The reader will pardon me , by the way , if I have somewhat perplexed him , now and then , by a similarity between the names of “ Genevieve ” and “ Genevra . ” Both are used by the writers of the French Fabliaux as synonymous with Guenever ; and the more shrewd will perhaps perceive that the reason why the name of Lancelot 's mistress has been made almost identical with that of Arthur 's , is to vindicate the fidelity of the Cymrian Queen Guenever from that scandal which the levity of French romance has most improperly cast upon it , in connection with Lancelot . It is to be presumed that those ancient slanderers were misled by the confusion of names , and that it was his own Genevra , and not Arthur 's Genevieve , who received Lancelot 's homage .— But indeed my Lancelot is altogether a different personage from the Lancelot represented in the Fabliaux as Arthur 's nephew .</p>

    <p n="1">Most of the Poems in this First Book have been recently composed , and hitherto unpublished ; and those which have appeared before , have been , some materially altered , all carefully revised .</p>
    <p n="2">In the Second Book some Poems were written in early life , and have been but little altered ; others — chiefly of a more thoughtful character — are of later date , and are now printed for the first time .</p>
    <p n="3">CORN-FLOWERS .</p>
    <p n="4">BOOK I .</p>
    <p n="5">THE FIRST VIOLETS .</p>
    <p n="6">Who that has loved knows not the tender tale Which flowers reveal , when lips are coy to tell ? Whose youth has paused not , dreaming , in the vale Where the rath violets dwell ?</p>
    <p n="7">Lo , where they shrink along the lonely brake , Under the leafless melancholy tree ; Not yet the cuckoo sings , nor glides the snake , Nor wild thyme lures the bee ;</p>
    <p n="8">Yet at their sight and scent entranced and thrall 'd , All June seems golden in the April skies ; How sweet the days we yearn for ,— till fulfill 'd : O distant Paradise ,</p>
    <p n="9">Dear Land to which Desire for ever flees ; Time doth no present to our grasp allow , Say in the fix 'd Eternal shall we seize At last the fleeting Now ?</p>
    <p n="10">Dream not of days to come — of that Unknown Whither Hope wanders — maze without a clue ; Give their true witchery to the flowers ;— thine own Youth in their youth renew .</p>
    <p n="11">Avarice , remember when the cowslip 's gold Lured and yet lost its glitter in thy grasp . Do thy hoards glad thee more than those of old ? Those wither 'd in thy clasp ,</p>
    <p n="12">From these thy clasp falls palsied .— It was then That thou wert rich — thy coffers are a lie ; Alas , poor fool , Joy is the wealth of men , And Care their penury .</p>
    <p n="13">Come , foil 'd Ambition , what hast thou desired ? Empire and power ?— O , wanderer , tempest-tost ! These once were thine , when life 's gay spring inspired Thy soul with glories lost .</p>
    <p n="14">Let the flowers charm thee back to that rich time When golden Dreamland lay within thy chart , When Love bestow 'd a realm indeed sublime — The boundless human heart .</p>
    <p n="15">Hark , hark again , the tread of bashful feet ! Hark the boughs rustling round the trysting-place ! Let air again with one dear breath be sweet , Earth fair with one dear face .</p>
    <p n="16">Brief-lived first flowers — first love ! The hours steal on To prank the world in summer 's pomp of hue , But what can flaunt beneath a fiercer sun Worth what we lose in you ?</p>
    <p n="17">Oft by a flower , a leaf , in some loved book We mark the lines that charm us most ;— Retrace Thy life ;— recall its loveliest passage ;— Look , Dead violets keep the place !</p>
    <p n="18">THE IMAGE ON THE TIDE .</p>
    <p n="19">Not a sound is heard But my heart by thine , Breathe not a word , Lay thy hand in mine .</p>
    <p n="20">How trembling , yet still , On the lake 's clear tide , Sleep the distant hill , And the bank beside .</p>
    <p n="21">The near and the far , Intermingled flow ; The herb and the star Imaged both below .</p>
    <p n="22">So deep and so clear , Through the shadowy light , The far and the near In my soul unite ;</p>
    <p n="23">The future and past , Like the bank and hill , On the surface glass 'd , Though they tremble still ;</p>
    <p n="24">Disturb not the dream Of this double whole ; The heav'n in the stream On my soul thy soul .</p>
    <p n="25">The sense cannot count ( As the waters glass The forest and mount And the clouds that pass )</p>
    <p n="26">The shadows and gleams In that stilly deep , Like the tranquil dreams Of a hermit 's sleep .</p>
    <p n="27">One shadow alone On my soul doth fall ,— And yet in the one It reflects on All .</p>
    <p n="28">IS IT ALL VANITY ?</p>
    <p n="29">Doubting of life , my spirit paused perplext Let fall its fardell of laborious care , And the sharp cry of my great trouble vext Unsympathizing air .</p>
    <p n="30">Out on this choice of unrewarded toil , This upward path into the realm of snow ! Oh for one glimpse of the old happy soil Fragrant with flowers below !</p>
    <p n="31">For what false gold , like alchemists , we yearn , Wasting the wealth we never can recall , Joy and life 's lavish prime ;— and our return ? Ashes , cold ashes , all !</p>
    <p n="32">Could youth but dream what narrow burial-urns Hopes that went forth to conquer worlds should hold , How in a tomb the lamp Experience burns Amidst the dust of old !—</p>
    <p n="33">Look back , how all the beautiful Ideal , Sporting in doubtful moonlight , one by one Fade from the rising of the hard-eyed Real , Like Fairies from the sun .</p>
    <p n="34">Love render 'd saintlike by its pure devotion ; Knowledge exulting lone by shoreless seas And Feelings tremulous to each emotion , As May leaves to the breeze .</p>
    <p n="35">And , oh , that grand Ambition , poet-nurst , When boyhood 's heart swells up to the Sublime , And on the gaze the towers of Glory first Flash from the peaks of Time !</p>
    <p n="36">Are they then wiser who but nurse the growth Of joys in life 's most common element , Creeping from hour to hour in that calm sloth Which Egoists call “ Content ? ”</p>
    <p n="37">Who freight for storms no hopeful argosy , Who watch no beacon wane on hilltops grey , Who bound their all , where from the human eye The horizon fades away ?</p>
    <p n="38">Alas for Labour , if indeed more wise To drink life 's tide unwitting where it flows ; Renounce the arduous palm , and only prize The Cnidian vine and rose !</p>
    <p n="39">Out from the Porch the Stoic cries “ For shame ! ” What hast thou left us , Stoic , in thy school ? “ That pain or pleasure is but in the name ? ” Go , prick thy finger , fool !</p>
    <p n="40">Never grave Pallas , never Muse severe Charm 'd this hard life like the free , zoneless Grace ; Pleasure is sweet , in spite of every sneer On Zeno 's wrinkled face .</p>
    <p n="41">What gain 'd and left ye to this age of ours Ye early priesthoods of the Isis , Truth ,— When light first glimmer 'd from the Cuthite 's towers ; When Thebes was in her youth ?</p>
    <p n="42">When to the weird Chaldaean spoke the seer , When Hades open 'd at Heraclean spells , When Fate made Nature her interpreter In leaves and murmuring wells ?</p>
    <p n="43">When the keen Greek chased flying Science on , Upward and up the infinite abyss ?— Like perish 'd stars your arts themselves have gone Noiseless to nothingness !</p>
    <p n="44">And what is knowledge but the Wizard 's ring , Kindling a flame to circumscribe a ground ? The belt of light that lures the spirit 's wing Hems the invoker round .</p>
    <p n="45">Ponder and ask again “ what boots our toil ? ” Can we the Garden 's wanton child gainsay , When from kind lips he culls their rosy spoil And lives life 's holiday ?</p>
    <p n="46">Life answers “ No — if ended here be life , Seize what the sense can give — it is thine all ; Disarm thee , Virtue , barren is thy strife ; Knowledge , thy torch let fall .</p>
    <p n="47">“ Seek thy lost Psyche , yearning Love , no more ! Love is but lust , if soul be only breath ; Who would put forth one billow from the shore If the great sea be — Death ? ”</p>
    <p n="48">But if the soul , that slow artificer For ends its instinct rears from life hath striven , Feeling beneath its patient webwork stir Wings only freed in Heaven ,</p>
    <p n="49">Then and but then to toil is to be wise ; Solved is the riddle of the grand desire Which ever , ever , for the Distant sighs , And must perforce aspire .</p>
    <p n="50">Rise , then , my soul , take comfort from thy sorrow ; Thou feel'st thy treasure when thou feel'st thy load ; Life without thought , the day without the morrow , God on the brute bestow 'd ;</p>
    <p n="51">Longings obscure as for a native clime , Flight from what is to live in what may be , God gave the Soul .— Thy discontent with Time Proves thine eternity .</p>
    <p n="52">THE TRUE JOY-GIVER .</p>
    <p n="53">Oh Oevoe , liber Pater , Oh , the vintage feast divine , When the God was in the bosom And his rapture in the wine ;</p>
    <p n="54">When the Faun laugh 'd out at morning ; When the Maenad hymn 'd the night ; And the Earth itself was drunken With the worship of delight ;</p>
    <p n="55">Oh Oevoe , liber Pater , Whose orgies are upon The hilltops of Parnassus , The banks of Helicon ;—</p>
    <p n="56">How often have I hail 'd thee ! How often have I been The bearer of the thyrsus , When its wither 'd leaves were green .</p>
    <p n="57">Then the boughs were purple gleaming With the dewdrop and the star ; And chanting came the wood-nymph , And flashing came the car .</p>
    <p n="58">Long faded are the garlands Of the thyrsus that I bore , When the wood-nymph chanted “ Follow ” In the vintage-feast of yore .</p>
    <p n="59">My vineyards are the richest Falernian slopes bestow ; Has the vineherd lost his cunning ? Has the summer lost its glow ?</p>
    <p n="60">Oh , never on Falernium The Care-Dispeller trod , Its vine-leaves wreathe no thyrsus , Its fruits allure no god .</p>
    <p n="61">For ever young , Lyaeus ; For ever young his priest ; The Boy-god of the Morning , The conqueror of the East ,</p>
    <p n="62">His wine is Nature 's life-blood ; His vineyards bloom upon The hilltops of Parnassus , The banks of Helicon .</p>
    <p n="63">But the hilltops of Parnassus Are free to every age ; I have trod them with the Poet , I have mapp 'd them with the Sage ;</p>
    <p n="64">And I 'll take my pert disciple To see , with humble eyes , How the Gladness-bringer honours The worship of the wise .</p>
    <p n="65">Lo , the arching of the vine-leaves ; Lo , the sparkle of the fount ; Hark , the carol of the Maenads ; Lo , the car is on the Mount !</p>
    <p n="66">“ Ho , room , ye thyrsus-bearers , Your playmate I have been ! ” “ Go , madman , ” laughs Lyaeus , “ Thy thyrsus then was green . ”</p>
    <p n="67">And adown the gleaming alleys The gladness-givers glide ; And the wood-nymph murmurs “ Follow , ” To the young man by my side .</p>
    <p n="68">BELIEF ; THE UNKNOWN LANGUAGE .</p>
    <p n="69">AN IDYLL .</p>
    <p n="70">By summer-reeds a music murmur 'd low , And straight the Shepherd-age came back to me ; When idylls breathed where Himera 's waters flow , Or on the Hoemus hill , or Rhodope ; [ A ]</p>
    <p n="71">As when the swans , by Moschus heard at noon , Mourn 'd their lost Bion on the Thracian streams ; [ B ] Or when Simaethea murmur 'd to the moon Of Myndian Delphis , [ C ] — old Sicilian themes .</p>
    <p n="72">Then softly turning , on the margent-slope Which back as clear translucent waters gave , Behold , a Shape as beautiful as Hope , And calm as Grief , bent , singing o'er the wave .</p>
    <p n="73">To the sweet lips , sweet music seem 'd a thing Natural as perfume to the violet . All else was silent ; not a zephyr 's wing Stirr 'd from the magic of the charmer 's net .</p>
    <p n="74">What was the sense beneath the silver tone ? What the fine chain that link 'd the floating measure ? Not mine , to say ,— the language was unknown , And sense was lost in undistinguish 'd pleasure .</p>
    <p n="75">Pleasure , dim-shadow 'd with a gentle pain As twilight Hesper with a twilight shroud ; Or like the balm of a delicious rain Press 'd from the fleeces of a summer cloud .</p>
    <p n="76">When the song ceased , I knelt before the singer And raised my looks to soft and childlike eyes , Sighing ? “ What fountain , O thou nectar-bringer Feeds thy full urn with golden melodies ?</p>
    <p n="77">“ Interpret sounds , O Hebe of the soul , Oft heard , methinks , in Ida 's starry grove , When to thy feet the charmed eagle stole , And the dark thunder left the brows of Jove ! ”</p>
    <p n="78">Smiling , the Beautiful replied to me , And still the language flow 'd in words unknown ; Only in those pure eyes my sense could see How calm the soul that so perplex 'd my own .</p>
    <p n="79">And while she spoke , symphonious murmurs rose ; Dryads from trees , Nymphs murmur 'd from the rills ; Murmur 'd Maenalian Pan from dim repose In the lush coverts of Pelasgic hills ;</p>
    <p n="80">Murmur 'd the voice of Chloris in the flower ; Bent , murmuring from his car , Hyperion ; Each thing regain 'd the old Presiding Power , And spoke ,— and still the language was unknown .</p>
    <p n="81">Dull listener , placed amidst the harmonious Whole , Hear'st thou no voice to sense divinely dark ? The sweetest sounds that wander to the soul Are in the Unknown Language .— Pause , and hark !</p>

    <p n="85">THE PILGRIM OF THE DESERT .</p>
    <p n="86">Wearily flaggeth my Soul in the Desert ; Wearily , wearily . Sand , ever sand , not a gleam of the fountain ; Sun , ever sun , not a shade from the mountain ; Wave after wave flows the sea of the Desert , Drearily , drearily .</p>
    <p n="87">Life dwelt with life in my far native valleys , Nightly and daily ; Labour had brothers to aid and beguile ; A tear for my tear , and a smile for my smile ; And the sweet human voices rang out ; and the valleys Echoed them gaily .</p>
    <p n="88">Under the almond-tree , once in the spring-time , Careless reclining ; The sigh of my Leila was hush 'd on my breast , As the note of the last bird had died in its nest ; Calm look 'd the stars on the buds of the spring-time , Calm — but how shining !</p>
    <p n="89">Below on the herbage there darken 'd a shadow ; Stirr 'd the boughs o'er me ; Dropp 'd from the almond-tree , sighing , the blossom ; Trembling the maiden sprang up from my bosom ; Then the step of a stranger came mute through the shadow , Pausing before me .</p>
    <p n="90">He stood grey with age in the robe of a Dervise , As a king awe-compelling ; And the cold of his eye like the diamond was bright , As if years from the hardness had fashion 'd the light , “ A draught from thy spring for the way-weary Dervise , And rest in thy dwelling . ”</p>
    <p n="91">And my herds gave the milk , and my tent gave the shelter ; And the stranger spell-bound me With his tales , all the night , of the far world of wonder , Of the ocean of Oman with pearls gleaming under ; And I thought , “ O , how mean are the tents ’ simple shelter And the valleys around me ! ”</p>
    <p n="92">I seized as I listen 'd , in fancy , the treasures By Afrites conceal 'd ; Scared the serpents that watch in the ruins afar O'er the hoards of the Persian in lost Chil-Menar ;— Alas ! ill that night happy youth had more treasures Than Ormus can yield .</p>
    <p n="93">Morn came , and I went with my guest through the gorges In the rock hollow 'd ; The flocks bleated low as I pass 'd them ungrieving , The almond-buds strew 'd the sweet earth I was leaving ; Slowly went Age through the gloom of the gorges , Lightly Youth follow 'd .</p>
    <p n="94">We won through the Pass — the Unknown lay before me , Sun-lighted and wide ; Then I turn 'd to my guest , but how languid his tread , And the awe I had felt in his presence was fled , And I cried , “ Can thy age in the journey before me Still keep by my side ? ”</p>
    <p n="95">“ Hope and Wisdom soon part ; be it so , ” said the Dervise , “ My mission is done . ” As he spoke , came the gleam of the crescent and spear , Chimed the bells of the camel more sweet and more near ;— “ Go , and march with the Caravan , youth , ” sigh 'd the Dervise , “ Fare thee well ! ” — he was gone .</p>
    <p n="96">What profits to speak of the wastes I have traversed Since that early time ? One by one the procession , replacing the guide , Have dropp 'd on the sands , or have stray 'd from my side ; And I hear never more in the solitudes traversed The camel-bell 's chime .</p>
    <p n="97">How oft I have yearn 'd for the old happy valley , But the sands have no track ; He who scorn 'd what was near must advance to the far , Who forsaketh the landmark must march by the star , And the steps that once part from the peace of the valley Can never come back .</p>
    <p n="98">So on , ever on , spreads the path of the Desert , Wearily , wearily ; Sand , ever sand — not a gleam of the fountain ; Sun , ever sun — not a shade from the mountain ; As a sea on a sea , flows the width of the Desert , Drearily , drearily .</p>
    <p n="99">How narrow content , and how infinite knowledge ! Lost vale , and lost maiden ! Enclosed in the garden the mortal was blest : A world with its wonders lay round him unguest ; That world was his own when he tasted of knowledge — Was it worth Aden ?</p>
    <p n="100">THE KING AND THE WRAITH .</p>
    <p n="101">KING .</p>
    <p n="102">Who art thou , who art thou , indistinct as the spray Rising up from a torrent in vapour and cloud ? Ghastly Phantom , obscuring the splendour of day And enveloped in awe , as a corpse with a shroud ?</p>
    <p n="103">WRAITH .</p>
    <p n="104">King , my form is thy shade , And my life is thy breath ; Lo , thy likeness display 'd In the mirror of Death !</p>
    <p n="105">KING .</p>
    <p n="106">My veins are as ice ! ‘ Tis my voice that I hear ! ‘ Tis my form coming forth from the cloud that I see ! My voice ?— can its sound be so dread to my ear ? My form ?— can myself be so loathly to me ?</p>
    <p n="107">WRAITH .</p>
    <p n="108">Never Man comes in sight Of himself till the last ; In the flicker of light When the fuel is past !</p>
    <p n="109">KING .</p>
    <p n="110">Nay , avaunt , lying Spectre , my fears are dispell 'd , For the likeness that fool 'd me is fading away , And I see , where the shape of a king was beheld , But the coil of an earthworm that creeps into clay .</p>
    <p n="111">WRAITH .</p>
    <p n="112">As thy shade I began ; As thyself I depart ; And thy last looks , O Man , See the worm that thou art !</p>
    <p n="113">LOVE AND DEATH .</p>
    <p n="114">O Strong as the eagle , O mild as the dove , How like and how unlike O Death and O Love !</p>
    <p n="115">Knitting earth to the heaven , The near to the far , With the step in the dust , And the eye on the star .</p>
    <p n="116">Ever changing your symbols Of light or of gloom ; Now the rue on the altar , The rose on the tomb .</p>
    <p n="117">From Love , if the infant Receiveth his breath , The love that gave life Yields a subject to Death .</p>
    <p n="118">When Death smites the aged , Escaping above Flies the soul re-deliver 'd By Death unto Love .</p>
    <p n="119">And therefore in wailing We enter on life ; And therefore in smiling Depart from its strife .</p>
    <p n="120">Thus Love is best known By the tears it has shed ; And Death 's surest sign Is the smile of the dead .</p>
    <p n="121">The purer the spirit , The clearer its view , The more it confoundeth The shapes of the two ;</p>
    <p n="122">For , if thou lov'st truly , Thou canst not dissever The grave from the altar , The Now from the Ever ;</p>
    <p n="123">And if , nobly hoping , Thou gazest above , In Death thou beholdest The aspect of LOVE .</p>
    <p n="124">THE POET TO THE DEAD .</p>
    <p n="125">PART I .</p>
    <p n="126">RETROSPECTION FROM THE HALTING-PLACE .</p>
    <p n="127">Let me pause , for I am weary , Weary of the trodden ways ; And the landscape spreads more dreary Where it stretches from my gaze .</p>
    <p n="128">Many a prize I deem 'd a blessing When I started for the goal , Midway in the course possessing Adds a burthen to the soul .</p>
    <p n="129">By the thorn that scantly shadeth From the sloped sun reclin 'd , Let me look , before it fadeth On the eastern hill behind ;—</p>
    <p n="130">On the hill that life ascended , While the dewy morn was young ; While the mist with light contended And the early skylark sung .</p>
    <p n="131">Then , as when at first united , Rose together Love and Day ; Nature with her sun was lighted , And my soul with Viola !</p>
    <p n="132">O my young earth 's lost Immortal ! Naiad vanish 'd from the streams ! Eve , torn from me at the portal Of my Paradise of Dreams !</p>
    <p n="133">On thy name , with lips that quiver , With a voice that chokes , I call .— Well ! the cave may hide the river , But the ocean merges all .</p>
    <p n="134">Yet , if but in self-deceiving , Can no magic charm thy shade ? Come unto my human grieving , Come , but as the human maid !</p>
    <p n="135">By the fount where love was plighted Where the lone wave glass 'd the skies ; By the hands that once united ; By the welcome of the eyes ;</p>
    <p n="136">By the silence sweetly broken When the full heart murmur 'd low , And with sighs the words were spoken Ere the later tears did flow ;</p>
    <p n="137">By the blush and soft confession ; By the wanderings side by side ; By the love-denied possession ; And the heavenlier , so denied ;</p>
    <p n="138">By the faith yet undiverted ; By the worship sacred yet ; To the soul so long deserted , Come , as when of old we met ;</p>
    <p n="139">Blooming as my youth beheld thee In the trysting-place of yore ,— Hark a footfall ! I have spell 'd thee , Lo , thy living smile once more !</p>
    <p n="140">PART II .</p>
    <p n="141">THE MEETING-PLACE OF OLD .</p>
    <p n="142">Glides the brooklet through the rushes , Now with dipping boughs at play , Now with quicker music-gushes Where the pebbles chafe the way .</p>
    <p n="143">Lonely from the lonely meadows Slopes the undulating hill ; And the slowness of its shadows But at sunset gains the rill :</p>
    <p n="144">Not a sign of man 's existence , Not a glimpse of man 's abode , Yet the church-spire in the distance Links the solitude with God .</p>
    <p n="145">All so quiet , all so glowing , In the golden hush of noon ; Nature 's still heart overflowing From the breathless lips of June .</p>
    <p n="146">Song itself the bird forsaketh , Save from wooded deeps remote , Mellowly and singly breaketh , Mellowly , the cuckoo 's note .</p>
    <p n="147">‘ Tis the scene where youth beheld thee ; ‘ Tis the trysting-place of yore ; Yes , my mighty grief hath spell 'd thee , Blooming — living — mine once more !</p>
    <p n="148">PART III .</p>
    <p n="149">LOVE UNTO DEATH .</p>
    <p n="150">Hand in hand we stood confiding , Boy and maiden , hand in hand , Where the path , in twain dividing , Reach 'd the Undiscover 'd Land .</p>
    <p n="151">Oh , the Hebe then beside me , Oh , the embodied Dream of Youth , With an angel 's soul to guide me , And a woman 's heart to soothe !</p>
    <p n="152">Like the Morning in the gladness Of the smile that lit the skies ; Liker Twilight in the sadness Lurking deep in starry eyes !</p>
    <p n="153">Gaudier flowerets had effaced thee In the formal garden set ; Nature in the shade had placed thee With thy kindred violet ;</p>
    <p n="154">As the violet to completeness Coming even ere the day ; All thy life a silent sweetness Waning with a warmer ray .</p>
    <p n="155">So , upon the verge of sorrow Stood we , blindly , hand in hand , Whispering of a happy morrow In that undiscover 'd land .</p>
    <p n="156">Thou , O meek one , fame foretelling , Grown ambitious but for me ; While my heart , if proudly swelling , Beat — ah , not for Fame , but thee !</p>
    <p n="157">In that summer-noon we parted , Life redundant over all . Once again — O broken-hearted — When the autumn leaves did fall ,</p>
    <p n="158">Meeting — life from life to sever ! Parting ,— as depart the dead , When the dark “ Farewell for ever , ” Fades from marble lips , unsaid ;</p>
    <p n="159">As upon a bark that slowly Lessens lone adown the sea , Looks abandon 'd Melancholy — Did thy still eyes follow me !</p>
    <p n="160">Wilful in thy self devotion , Patient on the desert shore , Gazing , gazing , till from ocean Waned thy last hope evermore .</p>
    <p n="161">Gentle victim , they might bind thee , But to fetter was to slay ; As a statue they enshrined thee , At a sepulchre to pray ;</p>
    <p n="162">Bade the bloodless lips not falter ; Bade the cold despair be brave ; Yes , the next morn at the altar ! But the next moon in the grave !</p>
    <p n="163">Little dream 'd they when they bore thee To the nuptial funeral shrine , That to ME they did restore thee , And release thy soul to mine !</p>
    <p n="164">Well thy noble heart might smother Nature 's agonizing cry , What can perjure to another Faith — if firm eno ’ to die !</p>
    <p n="165">Yet can ev'n the grave regain thee ? Gain as human love would see ? Darling — Pardon , I profane thee ; Angel , bend and comfort me !</p>
    <p n="166">PART IV .</p>
    <p n="167">LOVE AFTER DEATH .</p>
    <p n="168">Cold the loiterer who refuseth At the well of life to drink , Till the wave a sparkle loseth , And the silver cord a link .</p>
    <p n="169">But the flagging of the forces In the journey of the soul , If the first draught waste the sources , If the first touch break the bowl !—</p>
    <p n="170">On the surface bright with pleasure Still thy distant shade was cast ; Ah ! the heart was where the treasure , And the Present with the Past .</p>
    <p n="171">If from Fame , the all-deceiver , Toil contending garlands sought , Oft our force if but our fever , And our swiftness flight from Thought .</p>
    <p n="172">Hollow Pleasure , vain Ambition , Give me back the impulse free — Hope that seem 'd its own fruition , Life contented but to be ,</p>
    <p n="173">When the earth with Heaven was haunted In the shepherd age of gold , And the Venus rose enchanted From the sunny seas of old .</p>
    <p n="174">Cease , not mine the ignoble moral Of an unresisted grief ; Can the lightning sear the laurel , Or the winter fade its leaf ?</p>
    <p n="175">Flowerless , fruitless , to the dying , Green as when the sap began , Bolt and winter both defying ,— So be manhood unto man .</p>
    <p n="176">Once I wander 'd forth dejected In the later times of gloom ; And the icy moon reflected One still shadow o'er thy tomb .</p>
    <p n="177">There , in desolation kneeling , Snows around me , stars above , Came that second world of feeling , Came that second birth of Love ,</p>
    <p n="178">When regret grows aspiration , When o'er chaos moves the breath ; And a new-born dim creation Rising , wid'ning , dawns from death .</p>
    <p n="179">Then methought my soul was lifted From the anguish and the strife ; With a finer vision gifted For the Spirituals of Life ;</p>
    <p n="180">For the links that , while they thrall us , Upward mount in just degree , Knitting even , if they gall us , Life to Immortality ;</p>
    <p n="181">For the subtler glories blending With the common air we know , Ansel hosts to heaven ascending Up the ladder based below .</p>
    <p n="182">Straight each harsher iron duty Did the sudden light illume ; Oh , what streams of solemn beauty Take their sources in the tomb !</p>
    <p n="183">PART V .</p>
    <p n="184">THE PANTHEISM OF LOVE PASSING INTO THE IDEAL .</p>
    <p n="185">Then I rose , at dawn departing , Wan the dead earth , wan the snow , Wan the frost-beam dimly darting Where the corn-seed lurk 'd below ;</p>
    <p n="186">From that night , as streams dividing At the fountain till the sea , Wildly chafing , gently gliding , Life has twofold lives for me ;</p>
    <p n="187">One by mart and forum passing , Vex 'd reflection of the crowd ; One the hush of forests glassing , Or the changes of the cloud .</p>
    <p n="188">By the calmer stream , for ever Dwell the ghosts that haunt the heart , And the phantoms and the river Make the Poet-World of Art .</p>
    <p n="189">There in all that Fancy gildeth , Still thy vanish 'd smile I see ; And each airy hall it buildeth Is a votive shrine to thee !</p>
    <p n="190">Do men praise the labour ?— gladden 'd That the homage may endure ; Do they scorn it ?— only sadden 'd That thine altar is so poor .</p>
    <p n="191">If the Beautiful be clearer As the seeker 's days decline , Should the Ideal not be nearer As my soul approaches thine ?</p>
    <p n="192">Thus the single light bereft me Fused through all creation flows ; Gazing where a sun had left me , Lo , the myriad stars arose !</p>
    <p n="193">PART VI .</p>
    <p n="194">THE MEMORY OF LOVE ASSOCIATES ITS CONSOLATIONS WITH ITS HOPES .</p>
    <p n="195">Now the eastern hill-top fadeth From the arid wastes forlorn , And the only tree that shadeth Has the scant leaves of the thorn .</p>
    <p n="196">Not a home to smile before me , Not a voice to cheer is heard ; Hush ! the thorn-leaves tremble o'er me ,— Hark , the carol of a bird !</p>
    <p n="197">Unto air what charm is given ? Angel , as a link to thee , Midway between earth and heaven Hangs the delicate melody !</p>
    <p n="198">How it teacheth while it chideth , Is the pathway so forlorn ? Mercy over man presideth , And — the bird sings from the thorn .</p>
    <p n="199">Floating on , the music leads me , As the pausing-place I leave , And the gentle wing precedes me Through the lulled airs of eve .</p>
    <p n="200">Stay , O last of all the number , Bathing happy plumes in light , Till the deafness of the slumber , Till the blindness of the night .</p>
    <p n="201">Only for the vault to leave thee , Only with my life to lose ; Let my closing eyes perceive thee , Fold thy wings amid the yews .</p>
    <p n="202">MIND AND SOUL .</p>
    <p n="203">Hark ! the awe-whisperd 'd prayer , “ God spare my mind ! ” Dust unto dust , the mortal to the clod ; But the high place , the altar that has shrined Thine image ,— spare , O God !</p>
    <p n="204">Thought , the grand link from human life to Thee , The humble reed that by the Shadowy River Responds in music to the melody Of spheres that hymn for ever ,—</p>
    <p n="205">The order of the mystic world within , The airy girth of all things near and far ; Sense , though of sorrow ,— memory , though of sin ,— Gleams through the dungeon bar ,—</p>
    <p n="206">Vouchsafe me to the last !— Though none may mark The solemn pang , nor soothe the parting breath , Still let me seek for God amid the dark , And face , unblinded , Death !</p>
    <p n="207">Whence is this fine distinction twixt the twain Rays of the Maker in the lamp of clay Spirit and Mind ?— strike the material brain , And soul seems hurl 'd away .</p>
    <p n="208">Touch but a nerve , and Brutus is a slave ; A nerve , and Plato drivels ! Was it mind , Or soul , that taught the wise one in the cave , The freeman in the wind ?</p>
    <p n="209">If mind — O Soul ! what is thy task on earth ? If soul ! O wherefore can a touch destroy , Or lock in Lethe 's Acherontian dearth , The Immortal 's grief and joy ?</p>
    <p n="210">Hark , how a child can babble of the cells Wherein , beneath the perishable brow , Fancy invents , and Memory chronicles , And Reason asks — as now :</p>
    <p n="211">Mapp 'd are the known dominions of the thought , But who shall find the palace of the soul ? Along what channels shall the source be sought , The well-spring of the whole ?</p>
    <p n="212">Look round , vain questioner ,— all space survey , Where'er thou lookest , lo , how clear is Mind ! The laws that part the darkness from the day , And the sweet Pleiads bind ,</p>
    <p n="213">The thought , the will , the art , the elaborate power Of the Great Cause from whence the All began , Gaze on the star , or bend above the flower , Still speak of Mind to man .</p>
    <p n="214">But the arch soul of soul — from which the law Is but the shadow , who on earth can see ? What guess cleaves upward through the deeps of awe , Unspeakable , to thee ?</p>
    <p n="215">As in Creation lives the Father Soul , So lives the soul He breathed amidst the clay ; Round it the thoughts on starry axles roll , Life flows and ebbs away .</p>
    <p n="216">If chaos smote the universe again , And new Chaldeans shudder 'd to explore Amidst the maddening elements in vain The harmonious Mind of yore ,</p>
    <p n="217">Would not God live the same ?— the Unseen Spirit , Whether that life or wills or wrecks Creation ?— So lives , distinct , the god-spark we inherit , When Mind is desolation .</p>
    <p n="218">THE GUARDIAN ANGEL .</p>
    <p n="219">From Heaven what fancy stole The dream of some good spirit , aye at hand , The seraph whispering to the exile soul Tales of its native land ?</p>
    <p n="220">Who to the cradle gave The unseen watcher by the mother 's side , Born with the birth , companion to the grave , The holy angel-guide ?</p>
    <p n="221">Is it a fable ?— “ No , ” I hear LOVE answer from the sunlit air , “ Still where my presence gilds the darkness — know Life 's angel-guide is there ? ”</p>
    <p n="222">Is it a fable ?— Hark , FAITH hymns from deeps beyond the palest star , “ I am the pilot to thy wandering bark , Thy guide to shores afar . ”</p>
    <p n="223">Is it a fable ?— sweet From wave , from air , from every forest tree , The murmur spoke , “ Each thing thine eyes can greet An angel-guide can be .</p>
    <p n="224">“ From myriads take thy choice , In all that lives a guide to God is given ; Ever thou hear'st some angel guardian 's voice When Nature speaks of Heaven ! ”</p>
    <p n="225">THE LOVE OF MATURER YEARS .</p>
    <p n="226">Nay , soother , do not dream thine art Can altar Nature 's stern decree ; Or give me back the younger heart , Whose tablets had been clear to thee .</p>
    <p n="227">Why seek , fair child , to pierce the dark That wraps the giant wrecks of old ? Thou wert not with me in the ark , When o'er my life the deluge roll 'd .</p>
    <p n="228">To thee , reclining by the verge , The careless waves in music flow To me the ripple sighs the dirge Of my lost native world below .</p>
    <p n="229">Her tranquil arch as Iris builds Above the Anio 's torrent roar , Thy life is in the life it gilds , Born of the wave it trembles o'er .</p>
    <p n="230">For thee a glory leaves the skies If from thy side a step depart ; Thy sunlight beams from human eyes , Thy world is in one human heart .</p>
    <p n="231">And in the woman 's simple creed Since first the helpmate 's task began , Thou ask'st what more than love should need The stern insatiate soul of Man .</p>
    <p n="232">No more , while youth with vernal gale Breathes o'er the brief Arcadia still ;— But when the Wanderer quits the vale , But when the footstep scales the hill ,</p>
    <p n="233">But when with awe the wide expanse , The Pilgrim 's earnest eyes explore , How shrinks the land of sweet Romance , A speck — it was the world before !</p>
    <p n="234">And , hark , the Dorian fifes succeed The pastoral reeds of Arcady : Lo , where the Spartan meets the Mede , Near Tempe lies — Thermopyle !</p>
    <p n="235">Each onward step in hardy life , Each scene that memory halts to scan , Demands the toil , records the strife ,— And love but once is all to man .</p>
    <p n="236">Weep'st thou , fair infant , wherefore weep ? Long ages since the Persian sung “ The zephyr to the rose should keep , And youth should only love the young . ”</p>
    <p n="237">Ay , lift those chiding eyes of thine ; The trite , ungenerous moral scorn ! The diamond 's home is in the mine , The violet 's birth beneath the thorn ;</p>
    <p n="238">There , purer light the diamond gives Than when to baubles shaped the ray ; There , safe at least the violet lives From hands that clasp — to cast away .</p>
    <p n="239">Bloom still beside the mournful heart , Light still the caves denied the star ; Oh Eve , with Eden pleased to part , Since Eden needs no comforter !</p>
    <p n="240">My soft Arcadian , from thy bower I hear thy music on the hill ; And bless the note for many an hour When I too — am Arcadian still .</p>
    <p n="241">Whene'er the face of Heaven appears , As kind as once it smiled on me , I 'll steal adown the mount of years , And come — a youth once more , to thee .</p>
    <p n="242">From bitter grief and iron wrong When Memory sets her captive free , When joy is in the skylark 's song , My blithesome steps shall bound to thee ;</p>
    <p n="243">When Thought , the storm-bird , shrinks before The width of nature 's clouded sea , A voice shall charm it home on shore , To share the halcyon 's nest with thee :</p>
    <p n="244">Lo , how the faithful verse escapes The varying chime that laws decree , And , like my heart , attracted , shapes Each wandering fancy back — to thee .</p>
    <p n="245">THE EVERLASTING GRAVE-DIGGER .</p>
    <p n="246">Methought I stood amidst a burial-place And saw a phantom ply the sexton 's trade , Pale o'er the charnel bow 'd the phantom 's face , Noiseless the phantom spade Gleam 'd in the stars .</p>
    <p n="247">Wondering I ask 'd , “ Whose grave dost thou prepare ? ” The labouring ghost disdainful paused and said , “ To dig the grave is Death my father 's care , I disinter the dead Under the stars . ”</p>
    <p n="248">Therewith he cast a skull before my feet , A skull with worms encircled , and a crown , And mouldering shreds of Beauty 's winding-sheet . Chilling and cheerless down Shimmer 'd the stars .</p>
    <p n="249">“ And of the Past , ” I sigh 'd , “ are these alone The things disburied ? spare the dread repose , Or bring once more the monarch to his throne , To Beauty 's cheek the rose . ” Cloud wrapt the stars ,</p>
    <p n="250">While the pale sexton answer 'd , “ Fool , away ! Thou ask'st of Memory that which Faith must give ; Mine is the task to disinter the clay , Hers to bid life revive , ” — Cloud left the stars .</p>
    <p n="251">THE DISPUTE OE THE POETS .</p>
    <p n="252">An idyll scene of happy Sicily ! Out from its sacred grove on grassy slopes Smiles a fair temple , vow 'd to some sweet Power Of Nature deified . In broad degrees From flower-wreath 'd porticos the shining stairs , Through tiers of Myrtle in Corinthian urns , Glide to the shimmer of an argent lake . Calm rest the swans upon the glassy wave , Save where the younger cygnets , newly-pair 'd , Through floating brakes of water-lilies , sail Slowly in sunlight down to islets dim . But farther on , the lake subsides away Into the lapsing of a shadowy rill Melodious with the chime of falls as sweet As ( heard by Pan in Arethusan glades ) The silvery talk of meeting Naiades .</p>
    <p n="253">Where cool the sunbeam slants through ilex-boughs , The fane above them and the rill below , Two forms recline ; nor , e'er in Arcady Did fairer Manhood win an Oread 's love , Or lift diviner brows to earliest stars .</p>
    <p n="254">The one of brighter hues , and darker curls Clustering and purple as the fruit o ’ the vine , Seem 'd like that Summer-Idol of rich life Whom sensuous Greece , inebriate with delight , From Orient myth and symbol-worship brought To blue Cithaeron blithe with bounding faun And wood-nymph wild ,— Nature 's young Lord , Iacchus ! Bent o'er the sparkling brook , with careless hand From sedge or sward , he pluck 'd or reed or flower , Casting away light wreaths on playful waves ; While ,— as the curious ripple murmur 'd round Its odorous prey , and eddying whirl 'd it on O'er pebbles glancing sheen to sunny falls ,— He laugh 'd , as childhood laughs , in such frank glee The very leaves upon the ilex danced Joyous , as at some mirthful wind in May .</p>
    <p n="255">The other , though the younger , more serene , And to the casual gaze severer far , To that bright comrade-shape ; by contrast seem 'd As serious Morn , star-crown 'd on Spartan hills , To Noon , when hyacinths flush through Enna 's vales , Or murmurous winglets hum ‘ mid Indian palms . Such beauty his as the first Dorian bore From the far birthplace of Homeric men , Beyond the steeps of Boreal Thessaly , When to the swart Pelasgic Autocthon The blue-eyed Pallas came with lifted spear , And , her twin type of the fair-featured North . Phoebus , the archer with the golden hair . Bright was the one as Syrian Adon-ai , Charming the goddess born from roseate seas ; And while the other , leaning on his lyre , Lifted the azure light of earnest eyes From flower and wave to the remotest hill On which the soft horizon melted down , Ev'n so methought had gazed Endymion , With looks estranged from the luxuriant day , To the far Latmos steep — where holy dreams Nightly renew 'd the kisses of the Moon .</p>
    <p n="256">Entranced I stood , and held my breath to hear The words that seem 'd to warm upon their lips , As if such contest as two Nightingales Wage , emulous in music , on the peace That surely dwelt between them , had anon Forced its mellifluous anger :—</p>
    <p n="257">Then I learn 'd That the fair Two were orphans , rear 'd to youth Song and the lyre , where ringdoves coo remote , And loitering bees cull sweets in Hyblan dells : And that their discord , as their union , grew Out of their rivalry in lyre and song . Therewith did each in the accustom 'd war Of pastoral singers in Sicilian noons Strive for his Right — ( O Memory aid me now ! ) In the sweet quarrel of alternate hymns .</p>
    <p n="258">ANTHIOS .</p>
    <p n="259">As the sunlight that plays on a stream , As the zephyr that rustles a leaf , On my soul comes the joy of the beam , And a zephyr can stir it to grief .</p>
    <p n="260">Whether pleasure or pain be decreed , My voice but in music is heard ; By the sunny wave murmurs the reed ; From the sighing leaf carols the bird .—</p>
    <p n="261">LYKEGENES .</p>
    <p n="262">Unto her hierarch Nature 's voices come But through the labyrinthine cells of Thought , Not at the Porch , doth Isis hold her home , Not to the Tyro are her mysteries taught ;</p>
    <p n="263">The secret dews of many a starry night Feed the vast ocean 's stately ebb and flow ; The leaf is restless where the branch is slight , Still are the boughs whose shades stretch far below .</p>
    <p n="264">ANTHIOS .</p>
    <p n="265">As the skylark that mounts With the dawn to the sun , As the flash from the founts Of the swift Helicon ,</p>
    <p n="266">Song comes ;— and I sing ! Wouldst thou question me more ? Ask the wave or the wing Why it sparkle or soar !</p>
    <p n="267">LYKEGENES .</p>
    <p n="268">Full be the soul if swift the inspiration ! The corn-flower opens as the sheaves are rife ; Song is the twin of golden Contemplation The harvest-flower of life .</p>
    <p n="269">The Cloud-compeller 's bolt the eagle bears , But when the wings the strength divine have won , Full many a flight around the rock prepares The Aspirer towards the Sun ;</p>
    <p n="270">Progressive heights to gradual effort given , Till , all the plumes in light supreme unfurl 'd , It halts ;— and knits unto the dome of heaven This pendant ball — the World .</p>
    <p n="271">ANTHIOS .</p>
    <p n="272">Hail , O hail , Pierides , Free Harmonia 's zoneless daughters , Whom abrupt the Moenad sees By the marge of moonlit waters ,</p>
    <p n="273">Weaving joy in choral measure To no law but your sweet pleasure ; Wanton winds in loosen 'd hair Lifting gold that gilds the air ;</p>
    <p n="274">Say , beneath what starry skies Lurk the herbs that purge the eyes ? On what hill-tops should we cull The moly of the Beautiful ? What the charm the soul to capture In the cestus-belt of rapture , When the senses , trembling under , Glass the Shadow-land of Wonder , And no human hand is stealing O'er the music-scale of Feeling ?</p>
    <p n="275">As ceased the question rose delicious winds Stirring the waves that kiss 'd the tuneful reeds , And all the wealth of sweets in bells of flowers ; So that , methought , out from all life , the Muse Murmur 'd responses low , and echo 'd “ FEELING ! ”</p>
    <p n="276">LYKEGENES .</p>
    <p n="277">Divine Corycides , Whose chosen haunts are in mysterious cells , And alleys dim through gleaming laurel-trees Dusking the shrine of Delphian oracles ,— Under whose whispering shade Sits the lone Pythian Maid , Whose soul is as the glass of human things ; While up from bubbling streams In mists arise the Dreams Pale with the future of tiara 'd kings — Say , what the charm which from ambrosial domes Draws the Immortal to Time 's brazen towers , When on the soul the gentle Thunderer comes — Comes but in golden showers ? When , through the sealed portals of the sense , Fluent as air the Glory glides unsought ; And the serene effulgent Influence Rains all the wealth of heaven upon the thought ?</p>
    <p n="278">And as the questions ceased , fell every wind . The ilex-boughs droop 'd heavy as the hush In which the prophet Doves brood weird and calm Amid Dodonian groves ;— the broken light On crisped waves grew smooth ; on earth , in heaven , The inexpressive majesty of Silence Pass 'd as some Orient sovereign to his throne , When all the murmurs cease , and every brow Bends down in awe , and not a breath is heard . Yet spoke that stillness of the Eternal Mind That thinks , and , thinking , evermore creates ; And Nature seem 'd to answer Poesy From her deep heart , in thought re-echoing “ THOUGHT . ”</p>
    <p n="279">ANTHIOS .</p>
    <p n="280">Thou , whose silver lute contended With the careless reed of Pan — Thou whose wanton youth descended To the vales Arcadian , At whose coming heavenlier joy Lighteth even Jove 's abode , Ever blooming as the boy Through thine ages as the god ; Fair Apollo , if the singer Be like thee the gladness-bringer ; If the nectar he distil Make the worn earth useful still ; As thyself when thou wert driven To the Tempe from the heaven , As the infant over whom Saturn bends his brows of gloom , Roves he not the world a-maying , From his Idan halls exiled ; Or with Time repose in playing As with Saturn 's looks the child .</p>
    <p n="281">Therewith from far , where unseen hamlets lay In wooded valleys green , came mellowly Laughter and infant voices , borne perchance From the light hearts of happy Children , sporting Round some meek Mother 's knee ;— ev'n so , methought Did the familiar , human , innocent , gladness Through golden Childhood answer Song , “ THE CHILD . ”</p>
    <p n="282">LYKEGENES .</p>
    <p n="283">Lord of lustrating streams , And altars pure , appalling secret Crime , Eternal Splendour , whose all-searching beams Illume with life the universe of Time , All our own fates thy shrine reveals to us ; Thither comes Wisdom from the thrones of earth , The unraveller of the sphinx — blind Oedipus , Who knows not ev'n his birth ! On whom , Apollo , does thy presence shine Through the clear daylight of translucent song ? Only to him who serveth at the shrine , The priesthood can belong ! After due and deep probation , Only dawns thy revelation Unto the devout beseecher Taught by thee to grow the teacher : Shall the bearer of thy bow Let the shafts at random go ? If the altar be divine , Is the sacrifice a feast ? Should our hands the garland twine For the reveller or the priest ?</p>
    <p n="284">Therewith from out the temple on the hill Broke the rich swell of fifes and choral lyres , And the long melody of such large hymns , As to the conquest of the Python-slayer , Hallow 'd thy lofty chant , Calliope ! Thus from the penetralian aisles divine The solemn God replied to Song , “ THE PRIEST . ”</p>
    <p n="285">ANTHIOS .</p>
    <p n="286">And who can bind in formal duty The Protean shapes of airy Beauty ? Who tune the Teian 's lyre of gold To priestly hymns in temples cold ? Accept the playmate by thy side , Ordain 'd to charm thee , not to guide . The stream reflects each curve on shore , And Song alike thy good and error ; Let Wisdom be the monitor , But Song should be the mirror . To truth direct while Science goes With measured pace and sober eye ; The simplest wild-flower more bestows Than Egypt 's lore , on Poesy .</p>
    <p n="287">The Magian seer who counts the stars , Regrets the cloud that veils his skies ; To me , the Greek , the clouds are cars From which bend down divinities !</p>
    <p n="288">Like cloud itself this common day Let Fancy make awhile the duller , Its iris in the cloud shall play , And weave thy world the pomp of colour .</p>
    <p n="289">He paused ; as if in concord with the Song Seem 'd to flash forth the universe of hues In the Sicilian summer : on the banks Crocus , and hyacinth , and anemone , Superb narcissus , Cytherea 's rose , And woodbine lush , and lilies silver-starr 'd ; And delicate cloudlets blush 'd in lucent skies ; And yellowing sunbeams shot through purple waves ; And still from bough to bough the wings of birds , And still from flower to flower the gorgeous dyes Of the gay insect-revellers wandering went — And as I look 'd I murmur 'd , “ Singer , yes , As COLOUR to the world , so song to life ! ”</p>
    <p n="290">LYKEGENES .</p>
    <p n="291">Conceal 'd from Saturn 's deathful frown The wild Curetes strove , By chant and cymbal clash , to drown The infant cries of Jove . But when , full-grown , the Thunder-king , Triumphant o'er the Titan 's fall , And throned in Ida , look 'd on all , And all subjected saw ; Saw the sublime Uranian Ring , And every joyous living thing , Calm 'd into love beneath his tranquil law ;— Then straight above , below , around , His voice was heard in every sound ; The mountain peal 'd it through the cave ; The whirlwind to the answering wave ; By loneliest stream , by deepest dell , It murmur 'd in mysterious Pan ; No less than in the golden shell From which the falls of music well O'er floors Olympian ! For Jove in all that breathes must dwell , And speak through all to Man .</p>
    <p n="292">Singer , who asketh Hermes for his rod , To lead men 's souls into Elysian bowers , To whose belief the alter 'd earth is trod Still by Kronidian Powers , If through thy veins the purer tide hath been Pour 'd from the nectar-streams in Hebe 's urn , That thou mightst both without thee and within Feel the pervading Jove — wouldst thou return To the dark time of old , When Earth-born Force the Heir of Heaven controll 'd , And with thy tinkling brass aspire To stifle Nature 's music-choir , And drown the voice of God ?</p>
    <p n="293">O Light , thou poetry of Heaven , That glid'st through hollow air thy way , That fill'st the starry founts of Even , And all the azure seas of Day ; Give to my song thy glorious flow , That while it glads it may illume , Whether it gild the iris ’ bow , And part its rays amid the gloom ; Or whether , one broad tranquil stream , It break in no fantastic dyes , But calmly weaving beam on beam , Make Heaven distinct to human eyes ; A truth that floats serene and clear , ‘ Twixt Gods and men an atmosphere ; Less seen itself than bringing all to sight , And to man 's soul what to man 's world is Light .</p>
    <p n="294">Then , as the Singer ceased , the western sun Halted a moment o'er the roseate hill Hush 'd in pellucent air ; and all the crests Of the still groves , and all the undulous curves Of far-off headlands stood distinctly soft Against the unfathomable purple skies , And linking in my thought the outward shows Of Beauty with the inward types sublime , By which through Beauty poets lead to Knowledge , And are the lamps of Nature , “ Yes , ” I murmur 'd , “ Song is to soul what unto life is LIGHT ! ”</p>
    <p n="295">But gliding now behind the steeps it flush 'd , The disk of day sunk gradual , gradual down , And in the homage of the old Religion To the departing Sun ,— the rival two Ceased their dispute , and bent sweet serious brows In chorus with the cusps of bended flowers , Sighing their joint “ Farewell , O golden Sun ! ” Now Hesper came , the gentle shepherd-star , Bright as when Moschus sung to it ;— along The sacred grove , and through the Parian shafts Of the pale temple , shot the glistening rays , And trembled in the tremor of the wave :— Then the fair rivals , as they silent rose , Turn 'd each to each in brotherlike embrace ; Lone amid starry solitude they stood , In equal beauty clasp 'd ,— and both divine . [ D ]</p>
    <p n="296">[ D ] The reader will perceive that this poem is intended to illustrate a dispute which can never , perhaps , be critically solved — viz ., whether the true business of the poet be to delight or to instruct ;— and he will therefore be disposed to forgive me if he recognize certain thoughts or expressions freely borrowed from the various poets , who may be said to represent either side of the question . Among the moderns , SCHILLER especially has suggested ideas and illustrations on behalf of the more earnest creed professed by LYKEGENES — while GOETHE has been pressed to the aid of ANTHIOS . The Greek poets have here and there suggested a line on either side . After this general acknowledgment of obligation , it would be but pedantic to specify each special instance of imitative paraphrase or direct translation .</p>

    <p n="299">Upon the Phrygian hill He sate , and on his reed the shepherd play 'd . Sunlight and calm : noon in the dreamy glade , Noon on the lulling rill .</p>
    <p n="300">He saw not , where on high The noiseless eagle of the Heavenly King Rested ,— till rapt upon the rushing wing Into the golden sky .</p>
    <p n="301">When the bright Nectar Hall And the still brows of bended gods he saw , In the quick instinct both of shame and awe His hand the reed let fall .</p>

    <p n="310">THE ANGEL AND THE CHILD .</p>
    <p n="311">Upon a barren steep , Above a stormy deep , I saw an Angel watching the wild sea ; Earth was that barren steep , Time was that stormy deep , And the opposing shore — Eternity !</p>
    <p n="312">“ Why dost thou watch the wave ? Thy feet the waters lave , The tide engulfs thee if thou dost delay . ” “ Unscathed I watch the wave , Time not the Angel 's grave , I wait until the ocean ebbs away . ”</p>
    <p n="313">Hush 'd on the Angel 's breast I saw an Infant rest , Smiling upon the gloomy hell below . “ What is the Infant press 'd , O Angel , to thy breast ? ” “ The child God gave me , in The Long Ago .</p>
    <p n="314">“ Mine all upon the earth , The Angel 's angel-birth , Smiling each terror from the howling wild . ” Never may I forget The dream that haunts me yet , OF PATIENCE NURSING HOPE — THE ANGEL AND THE CHILD</p>

    <p>TO A WITHERED TREE IN JUNE . Desolate tree ! why are thy branches bare ? What hast thou done To win strange winter from the summer air , Frost from the sun ? Thou wert not churlish in thy palmier year Unto the herd ; Tenderly gav'st thou shelter to the deer , Home to the bird . And ever once , the earliest of the grove , Thy smiles were gay , Opening thy blossoms with the haste of love To the young May . Then did the bees , and all the insect wings Around thee gleam ; Feaster and darling of the gilded things That dwell i ’ the beam . Thy liberal course , poor prodigal , is sped ; How lonely now ! How bird and bee , light parasites , have fled The leafless bough ! “ Tell me , sad tree , why are thy branches bare ? What hast thou done To win strange winter from the summer air , Frost from the sun ? ” “ Never , ” replied that forest-hermit lone ( Old truth and endless ! ) “ Never for evil done , but fortune flown , Are we left friendless . “ Yet wholly , nor for winter nor for storm Doth Love depart ! We are not all forsaken till the worm Creeps to the heart ! “ Ah , nought without , within thee if decay , Can heal or hurt thee . Nor boots it , if thy heart itself betray , Who may desert thee ! ” ON THE REPERUSAL OF LETTERS WRITTEN IN YOUTH . Strange , as when vaguely through the autumn haze Loom the pale scenes last view 'd in summer skies , Out from the mist the thoughts of sunny days And golden youth arise . Were ye , in truth , my thoughts ?— along the years Flies back the wondering and incredulous Mind , In the still archives of lost hopes and fears Your date and tale to find . Gradual and slow , reweaving link to link , Epoch , and place , and image it recalls , And owns the thoughts it never more can think ,— Dim pictures in dim halls ! Dim pictures now ; and once ye breathed and moved , And took your life as proudly from the sun As if immortals !— schemed , aspired , and loved , And sunk to rest ;— sleep on ! On a past self the present self amazed Looks , and beholds no likeness !— Canst thou see In the pale features of the phantom raised One trace still true to thee ? ‘ Twas said “ The child is father to the man , ” By one whose world was but the shepherd 's range . What seas beyond thy vale , Arcadian , Ebb and reflow with change ! In the great deeps of reason , heart , and soul , Through shine or storm still roll the tides unfailing ; Each separate globule in the restless whole In daily airs exhaling . Thus evermore , albeit to erring eyes , The same wild surface dash to shore the spray , That seeming oneness every moment dies , Drop after drop , away . And stern indeed the prison of our doom If self from self had no divine escape ; If each dead passion slept not in the tomb ; If childhood , age could shape . Happy the man in whom with every year New life is born , re-baptized in the past ,— In whom each change doth but as growth appear , The loveliest change the last ! Full many a sun shall vanish from the skies And still the aloe show but leaves of thorn ; Leaf upon leaf , and thorn on thorn , arise , And lo — the flower is born ! THE DESIRE OF FAME . WRITTEN AT THE AGE OF THIRTY . I do confess that I have wish 'd to give My land the gift of no ignoble name . And in that holier air have sought to live , Sunn 'd with the hope of Fame . Do I lament that I have seen the bays Denied my own , not worthier brows above ,— Foes quick to scoff , and friends afraid to praise ,— More active hate than love ? Do I lament that roseate youth has flown In the hard labour grudged its niggard meed , And cull from far and juster lands alone Few flowers from many a seed ? No ! for whoever with an earnest soul Strives for some end from this low world afar , Still upward travels , though he miss the goal , And strays — but towards a star . Better than fame is still the wish for fame , The constant training for a glorious strife : The athlete nurtured for the Olympian Game Gains strength at least for life . The wish for Fame is faith in holy things That soothe the life , and shall outlive the tomb — A reverent listening for some angel wings That cower above the gloom . To gladden earth with beauty , or men 's lives To serve with action , or their souls with truth ,— These are the ends for which the hope survives The ignobler thirsts of youth . No , I lament not , though these leaves may fall From the sered branches on the desert plain , Mock 'd by the idle winds that waft ; and all Life 's blooms , its last , in vain ! If vain for others , not in vain for me ,— Who builds an altar let him worship there ; What needs the crowd ? though lone the shrine may be , Not hallow 'd less the prayer . Eno ’ if haply in the after days , When by the altar sleeps the funeral stone , When gone the mists our human passions raise , And Truth is seen alone : When causeless Hate can wound its prey no more , And fawns its late repentance o'er the dead , If gentle footsteps from some kindlier shore Pause by the narrow bed . Or if yon children , whose young sounds of glee Float to mine ear the evening gales along , Recall some echo , in their years to be , Of not all-perish 'd song ! Taking some spark to glad the hearth , or light The student lamp , from now neglected fires ,— And one sad memory in the sons requite What — I forgive the sires . THE LOYALTY OF LOVE . I love thee , I love thee ; In vain I endeavour To fly from thine image ; It haunts me for ever . All things that rejoiced me Now weary and pall ; I feel in thine absence Bereft of mine all . My heart is the dial ; Thy looks are the sun ; I count but the moments Thou shinest upon . Oh , royal , believe me , It is to control Two mighty dominions , The Heart and the Soul . To know that thy whisper Each pang can beguile ; And feel that creation Is lit by thy smile . Yet every dominion Needs care to retain — Dost thou know when thou pain'st me Or smile at the pain ? Alas ! the heart-sickness , The doubt and the dread , When some word that we pine for Cold lips have not said ! When no pulses respond to The feelings we prove ; And we tremble to question “ If this can be love ; ” At moments comparing Thy heart with mine own , I mourn not my bondage , I sigh for thy throne . For if thou forsake me , Too well I divine That no love could defend thee From sorrow like mine . And this , O ungrateful , I most should deplore — That the heart thou hadst broken Could shield thee no more ! A LAMENT . I stand where I last stood with thee ! Sorrow , O sorrow ! There is not a leaf on the trysting-tree ; There is not a joy on the earth to me ; Sorrow , O sorrow ! When shalt thou be once again what thou wert ? Oh , the sweet yesterdays fled from the heart ! Have they a morrow ?— Here we stood , ere we parted , so close side by side ; Two lives that once part , are as ships that divide When , moment on moment , there rushes between The one and the other , a sea ;— Ah , never can fall from the days that have been A gleam on the years that shall be ! LOST AND AVENGED . O God , give me rest from a thought ! I cannot escape it nor brave ; Dread ghost of a joy that I sought To harrow my soul from its grave ! Farewell to the smile of the sun , The cheerful Religion of Trust ! I centred my future in One , And wake as it crumbles to dust ! Oh , blest are the tears that are shed For love that was true to the last . The future restores us the dead , The false we expel from the past .— Yet all , when I summon my pride Thyself as I find thee to see , Again there descends to my side The angel I dreamt thee to be . Again thou enchantest my ear ; My soul hangs again on thy breath , And murmurs that melt in a tear Repeat “ I am thine unto death ! ” Again is the light of thine eyes The limpid reflection of Truth ; Thy smile gives me back to the skies That lit the ideals of youth . Oh , is it thyself that I mourn , Or is it that dream of my heart Which glides from the reach of my scorn , And soars from the clay that thou art ? Well , go — take this comfort with thee , ( I know thou art vain of thy power ,) Thou hast blighted existence for me , Thou hast left not a germ for the flower ; My star may escape the eclipse , The music that tuned it is o'er ; The smile may return to my lips — It fades from my heart evermore ; Yet dark on thy being will fall A shade from the wreck of my own , Long years shalt thou sigh over all Thou hast in a day overthrown . For none shall exalt thee as I ! Ah , none whom thy spells may control Shall deck thee in hues from the sky , And breathe in thy statue his soul .— None build from the glories of song The brighter existence above , The realm which to poets belong , The throne they bestow where they love . Let earth its chill colours regain , The moonlight depart from thy sea , Explore through creation in vain The fairy land vanish 'd with me . I take back the all I had given : Thy charm , with my folly is o'er ; From the rank I assign 'd thee in heaven Descend to thy level once more . O grief !— whether here or above , Must my soul thus be sever 'd from thine ? Ah , mourn — though I had not thy love — The sin that bereaves thee of mine . THE TREASURES BY THE WAYSIDE . A TALE FOR SORROW . The sky was dull , the scene was wild , I wander 'd up the mountain way ; And with me went a joyous child , The man in thought , the child at play , My heart was sad with many a grief ; Mine eyes with former tears were dim ; The child !— a stone , a flower , a leaf , Had each its fairy wealth to him ! From time to time , unto my side He bounded back to show the treasure ; I was not hard enough to chide , Nor wise enough to share his pleasure . We paused at last — the child began Again his sullen guide to tease ; “ They say you are a learned man — So look , and tell me what are these ? ” Aroused with pain , my listless eyes The various spoils scarce wander o'er ; Than straight they hail a sage 's prize In what seem 'd infant toys before : This herb was one the glorious Swede Had given a garden 's wealth to find ; That stone had harden 'd round a weed The earliest deluge left behind . Fit stores for science , Discontent Had pass 'd unheeding on the wild ; And Nature had her wonders lent As things of gladness to the child ! Thus , through the present , Sorrow goes , And sees its barren self alone ; While healing in the leaflet grows , And Time blooms back within the stone . O THOU , so prodigal of good , Whose wisdom with delight is clad ; How clear should be to Gratitude The golden duty — to be glad ! ADDRESS TO THE SOUL IN DESPONDENCY . No , Soul ! not in vain thou hast striven , Unless thou abandon the strife ; Forsworn to the banners of Heaven , If false in the battle of life . Why — counting the gain or the loss — The badge of the temple assume ? March on ! if thy sign be the Cross , Thy triumph must be at the Tomb . Say , doth not the soldier rejoice If placed by his chief at the van ? As spirit , submit to the choice The noble would welcome as man . “ Farewell to the splendour of light ! ” The Greek could exulting exclaim , Resign 'd to the Hades of Night , To live in the air as A NAME . Could he , for a future so vain , Every pang in the present control , Yet thou of a moment complain In thine infinite life as a soul ? Like thee , do not millions receive Their chalice embitter 'd with gall ? If good be creation — believe That good which is common to all ! In evil itself , to the glance Of the wise , half the riddles are clear Were wisdom but perfect , perchance , The rest might in love disappear . The thunder that scatters the pest May be but a type of the whole ; And storms which have darken 'd the breast May bring but its health to the soul . Can earth , where the harrow is driven , The sheaf in the furrow foresee ,— Or thou guess the harvest of heaven Where iron has enter 'd in thee ? CORN-FLOWERS . BOOK II . THE SABBATH . Fresh glides the brook and blows the gale , Yet yonder halts the quiet mill ; The whirring wheel , the rushing sail , How motionless and still ! Six days of toil , poor child of Cain , Thy strength the slave of Want may be ; The seventh thy limbs escape the chain — A God hath made thee free ! Ah , tender was the law that gave This holy respite to the breast , To breathe the gale , to watch the wave , And know — the wheel may rest ! But where the waves the gentlest glide What image charms , to lift , thine eyes ? The spire reflected on the tide Invites thee to the skies . To teach the soul its nobler worth This rest from mortal toils is given ; Go , snatch the brief reprieve from earth And pass — a guest to Heaven . They tell thee , in their dreaming school , Of Power from old dominion hurl 'd , When rich and poor , with juster rule , Shall share the alter 'd world . Alas ! since Time itself began , That fable hath but fool 'd the hour ; Each age that ripens Power in Man , But subjects Man to Power . Yet every day in seven , at least , One bright republic shall be known ;— Man 's world awhile hath surely ceased , When God proclaims his own ! Six days may Rank divide the poor , O Dives , from thy banquet-hall — The seventh the Father opes the door , And holds His feast for all ! THE HOLLOW OAK . Hollow is the oak beside the sunny waters drooping ; Thither came , when I was young , happy children trooping ; Dream I now , or hear I now — far , their mellow whooping ? Gay below the cowslip bank , see the billow dances , There I lay beguiling time — when I lived romances ; Dropping pebbles in the wave , fancies into fancies ;— Farther , where the river glides by the wooded cover , Where the merlin singeth low , with the hawk above her Came a foot and shone a smile — woe is me , the Lover ! Leaflets on the hollow oak still as greenly quiver , Musical amid the reeds murmurs on the river ; But the footstep and the smile ?— woe is me for ever ! LOVE AND FAME . WRITTEN IN EARLY YOUTH . I . It was the May when I was born , Soft moonlight through the casement stream 'd , And still , as it were yestermorn , I dream the dream I dream 'd . I saw two forms from fairy land , Along the moonbeam gently glide , Until they halted , hand in hand , My infant couch beside . II . With smiles , the cradle bending o'er , I heard their whisper 'd voices breathe — The one a crown of diamond wore , The one a myrtle wreath ; “ Twin brothers from the better clime , A poet 's spell hath lured to thee ; Say which shall , in the coming time , Thy chosen fairy be ? ” III . I stretch 'd my hand , as if my grasp Could snatch the toy from either brow ; And found a leaf within my clasp , One leaf — as fragrant now ! If both in life may not be won , Be mine , at least , the gentler brother — For he whose life deserves the one , In death may gain the other . LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT . I . Into my heart a silent look Flash 'd from thy careless eyes , And what before was shadow , took The Light of summer skies . The first-born love was in that look ; The Venus rose from out the deep Of those inspiring eyes . II . My life , like some lone solemn spot A spirit passes o'er , Grew instinct with a glory not In earth or heaven before . Sweet trouble stirr 'd the haunted spot , And shook the leaves of every thought Thy presence wander 'd o'er ! III . My being yearn 'd , and crept to thine , As if in times of yore Thy soul had been a part of mine , Which claim 'd it back once more . Thy very self no longer thine , But merged in that delicious life , Which made us ONE of yore ! IV . There bloom 'd beside thee forms as fair , There murmur 'd tones as sweet , But round thee breathed the enchanted air ‘ Twas life and death to meet . And henceforth thou alone wert fair , And though the stars had sung for joy , Thy whisper only sweet ! LOVE 'S SUDDEN GROWTH . I . But yestermorn , with many a flower The garden of my heart was dress 'd ; A single tree has sprung to bloom , Whose branches cast a tender gloom , That shadows all the rest . II . A jealous and a tyrant tree , That seeks to reign alone ; As if the wind 's melodious sighs , The dews and sunshine of the skies , Were only made for One ! III . A tree on which the Host of Dreams Low murmur mystic things , While hopes , those birds of other skies , To dreams themselves chant low replies — Ah , wherefore have they wings ? IV . The seasons nurse the blight and storm , The glory leaves the air — The dreams and birds will pass away , The blossom wither from the spray — One day — the stem be bare — V. But mine has grown the Dryad 's life , Coeval with the tree ; The sun , the frost , the bloom , the fall , My fate , sweet tree , must share them all , To live and die with thee ! THE LOVE-LETTER . As grains of gold that in the sands Of Lydian waters shine , The welcome sign of mountain lands That veil the silent mine ; Thus may the river of my thought , That glideth now to thee , Reveal the wealth as yet unwrought , Which Love has heap 'd in me ! So strove I to enrich the scroll To thy dear hands consign 'd ; I thought to leave the lavish soul No golden wish behind ! Ah , fool ! to think an hour could drain What life can scarce explore — Enough , if guided by the grain , Thy heart should seek the ore ! THE LANGUAGE OF THE EYES . Those eyes — those eyes — how full of Heaven they are ! When the calm twilight leaves the heaven most holy ; Tell me , sweet eyes , from what divinest star Did ye drink in your liquid melancholy ? Tell me , beloved eyes ! Was it from yonder orb that ever by The quiet moon , like Hope by Patience , hovers , The star to which hath sped so many a sigh , Since lutes in Lesbos hallow 'd it to Lovers ? Was that your Fount , sweet Eyes ? Ye Sibyl books , in which the truths foretold Inspire the Heart , your dreaming priest , with gladness , Bright Alchemists that turn to thoughts of gold The leaden cares ye steal away from sadness , Teach only me , sweet Eyes ! Hush ! when I ask ye how , at length , to gain The cell where Love , the sleeper , yet lies hidden , Loose not those arch lips from their rosy chain ; Be every answer , save your own , forbidden — Feelings are words for Eyes ! DOUBT . Bright laughs the sun ; the birds , that are to air Like song to life , are gaily on the wing ; In every mead the handmaid hours prepare The delicates of spring ; [ E ] But , if she love me not ! To me at this fair season still hath been In every wild-flower an exhaustless treasure , And , when the young-eyed violet first was seen , Methought to breathe was pleasure ;— But , if she love me not ! How , in thy twilight , Doubt , at each unknown Dim shape , the superstitious Love will start ; How Hope itself will tremble at its own Light shadow on the heart !— Ah , if she love me not ! Well ; I will know the worst , and leave the wind To drift or drown the venture on the wave ; Life has two friends in grief itself most kind — Remembrance and the Grave — Mine , if she love me not ! [ E ] “ The choicest delicates from yonder mead . ” — The Faithful Shepherdess . THE ASSURANCE . I am loved , I am loved — Jubilate ! Hark ! hark ! how the happy note swells To and fro from the fairy bells , With which the flowers melodiously To their banquet halls invite the bee !— “ He is loved , he is loved — Jubilate ! ” The echo at rest on her mountain-keep Murmurs the sound in her broken sleep — “ He is loved , he is loved — Jubilate ! ” And those gossips , the winds , have come to scout What the earth is so happy about , And they catch the sound , and circle it round — “ He is loved , he is loved — Jubilate ! ” And the rivers , who , all the world must know , Were in love with the stars ever since they could flow , With a dimpled cheek and a joyous sigh , Whisper it up to the list'ning sky , “ He is loved , he is loved — Jubilate ! ” It is not the world that I knew before ; Where is the gloom that its glory wore ? Not a foe could offend , nor a friend betray , Old Hatred hath gone to his grave to-day ! Hark ! hark ! his knell we toll , Here 's to the peace of his sinful soul ! On the earth below , in the heaven above , Nothing is left me now but Love . Love , Love , honour to Love , I am loved , I am loved — Jubilate ! MEMORIES , THE FOOD OF LOVE . When shall we come to that delightful day , When each can say to each , “ Dost thou remember ? ” Let us fill urns with rose-leaves in our May , And hive the thrifty sweetness for December ! For who may deem the throne of love secure , Till o'er the Past the conqueror spreads his reign ? That only land where human joys endure , That dim elysium where they live again ! Swell 'd by a thousand streams the deeps that float The bark on which we risk our all , should be . A rill suffices for the idler 's boat : It needs an ocean for the argosy . The heart 's religion keeps , apart from time , The sacred burial-ground of happy hours ; The past is holy with the haunting chime Of dreamy sabbath bells from distant towers . Oft dost thou ask me , with that bashful eye , “ If I shall love thee evermore as now ! ” Feasting as fondly on the sure reply , As if my lips were virgin of the vow . Sweet does that question , “ Wilt thou love me ? ” fall Upon the heart that has forsworn its will : But when the words hereafter we recall , “ Dost thou remember ? ” shall be sweeter still . ABSENT , YET PRESENT . As the flight of a river That flows to the sea , My soul rushes ever In tumult to thee . A twofold existence I am where thou art ; My heart in the distance Beats close to thy heart . Look up , I am near thee , I gaze on thy face ; I see thee , I hear thee , I feel thine embrace . As a magnet 's control on The steel it draws to it , Is the charm of thy soul on The thoughts that pursue it . And absence but brightens The eyes that I miss , And custom but heightens The spell of thy kiss . It is not from duty , Though that may be owed ,— It is not from beauty , Though that be bestow 'd ; But all that I care for , And all that I know , Is that , without wherefore , I worship thee so . Through granite as breaketh A tree to the ray , As a dreamer forsaketh The grief of the day , My soul in its fever Escapes unto thee ; O dream to the griever , O light to the tree ! A twofold existence I am where thou art ; Hark , hear in the distance The beat of my heart ! LOVERS ’ QUARRELS . AN OLD MAXIM REFUTED . They never loved as thou and I , Who preach 'd the laughing moral , That aught which deepens love can lie In true love 's lightest quarrel . They never knew , in times of fear , The safety of affection , Nor sought , when angry fate drew near , Love 's altar for protection . They never knew how kindness grows A vigil and a care , Nor watch 'd beside the heart 's repose In silence and in prayer ; For weaker love be storms enough To frighten back desire ; We have no need of gales so rough To fan our steadier fire . ‘ Twere sweet to kiss thy tears away , If tears those eyes must know ; But sweeter still to hear thee say , “ Thou never badst them flow . ” The wrongful word will rankling live When wrong itself has ceased , And love , that all things may forgive , Can ne'er forget the least . If pain can not from life depart , There 's pain enough around us ; The rose we wear upon the heart Should have no thorn to wound us . And hollow sounds the wildest vow , If memory wake , the while , The bitter taunt — the darken 'd brow , The stinging of a smile . There is no anguish like the hour , Whatever else befall us , When one the heart has raised to power Exerts it but to gall us . Yet if — this calm too blest to last — Some cloud , at times , must be , I 'm not so proud but I would cast The fault alone on me . So deeply blent with thy dear thought , All faith in human kindness , Methinks if thou couldst change in aught , The only bliss were blindness . But no — if rapture may not last , It ne'er shall bring regret , Nor leave one look in all the past ‘ Twere mercy to forget . Repentance often finds , too late , To wound us is to harden ; And love is on the verge of hate , Each time it stoops for pardon . THE LAST SEPARATION . We shall not rest together , love , When death has wrench 'd my heart from thine ; The sun may smile thy grave above , When clouds are dark on mine ! I know not why , since in the tomb No instinct fires the silent heart — And yet it seems a thought of gloom , That even dust should part ; That , journeying through the toilsome past , Thus hand in hand and side by side , The rest we reach should , at the last , The shapes we wore divide ; That the same breezes should not sigh The self-same funeral boughs among ,— Nor o'er one grave , at daybreak , die The night-bird 's lonely song ! A foolish thought ! the spirit goal Is not where matter wastes away ; If soul at last regaineth soul , What boots it where the dust decay ? A foolish thought , yet human too ! For love is not the soul 's alone : It winds around the form we woo — The mortal we have known ! The eyes that speak such tender truth , The lips that every care assuage , The hand that thrills the heart in youth , And smoothes the couch in age ; With these — The Human ,— human love Will twine its thoughts and weave its doom , And still confound the life above With death beneath the tomb ! And who shall tell , in yonder skies , What earthlier instincts we retain ; What link , to souls released , supplies The old material chain ? The stars that pierced this darksome state May fade in that meridian shore ; And human love , like human hate , Be memory — and no more ! Away the doubt ! alas , how cold Would all the promised heaven appear , Did yearning love no more behold What made its Eden here ! But wheresoe'er the spirit flies , It haunts us in the shape it wore ; We give the angel in the skies The mortal 's smile of yore ; Yet , ah , when souls from life escape , Material forms no more they know ; Not Heaven itself restores the shape So fondly loved below ! Immortal spirits meet above ; But mine is still the human heart ; And in its faithful human love , It mourns that dust should part ! THE POPE AND THE BEGGAR . THE DESIRES THE CHAINS , THE DEEDS THE WINGS . I saw a soul beside the clay it wore , When reign 'd that clay the Hierarch-Sire of Rome ; A hundred priests stood ranged the bier before , Within St. Peter 's dome . And all was incense , solemn dirge , and prayer , And still the soul stood sullen by the clay : “ O soul , why to thy heavenlier native air Dost thou not soar away ? ” And the soul answer 'd , with a ghastly frown , “ In what life loved , death finds its weal or woe ; Slave to the clay 's Desires , they drag me down To the clay 's rot below ! ” It spoke , and where Rome 's purple ones reposed , They lower 'd the corpse ; and downwards from the sun Both soul and body sunk — and darkness closed Over that twofold one ! Without the church , unburied on the ground , There lay , in rags , a beggar newly dead ; Above the dust no holy priest was found , No pious prayer was said ! But round the corpse unnumber 'd lovely things , Hovering unseen by the proud passers by , Form 'd , upward , upward , upward , with bright wings , A ladder to the sky ! “ And what are ye , O beautiful ? ” “ We are , ” Answer 'd the choral cherubim , “ His Deeds ! ” Then his soul , sparkling sudden as a star , Flash 'd from its mortal weeds , And , lightly passing , tier on tier , along The gradual pinions , vanish 'd like a smile ! Just then , swept by the solemn-visaged throng From the Apostle 's pile . “ Knew ye this beggar ? ” “ Knew ! a wretch , who died Under the curse of our good Pope , now gone ! ” “ Loved ye that Pope ? ” “ He was our Church 's pride , And Rome 's most holy son ! ” Then did I muse : such are men 's judgments ; blind In scorn or love ! In what unguess'dhYpppHeNof things , Desires or Deeds — do rags and purple find The fetters or the wings ! THE BEAUTIFUL DESCENDS NOT . In Cyprus , looking on the lovely sky , Lone by the marge of music-haunted streams , A youthful poet pray 'd : “ Descend from high , Thou of whose face each youthful poet dreams . Once more , Urania , to the earth be given The beauty that makes beautiful the heaven . ” Swift to a silver cloudlet , floating o'er , A rushing Presence rapt him as he pray 'd ; What he beheld I know not , but once more The midnight heard him sighing to the shade , “ Again , again unto the earth be given The beauty that makes beautiful the heaven . ” “ In vain , ” a sweet voice answer 'd from the star , “ Her grace on thee Urania did bestow : Unworthy he the loftier realms afar , Who woos the gods above to earth below ; Rapt to the Beautiful thy soul must be , And not the Beautiful debased to thee ! ” THE LONG LIFE AND THE FULL LIFE . IMITATED FROM CLAUDIAN 'S “ OLD MAN OF VERONA . ” In mine own hamlet , where , amidst the green , By moss-grown pales white gleaming cots are seen , There dwelt a peasant in his eightieth year , Dear to my childhood — now to memory dear ; In the same hut in which his youth had pass 'd Dwelt his calm age , till earth received at last ; Where first his infant footsteps tottering ran , Propp 'd on his staff crawl 'd forth the hoary man ; That quiet life no varying fates befell , The patriarch sought no Laban 's distant well ; Of Rothschild 's wealth , of Wellesley 's mighty name To that seal 'd ear no faintest murmur came . His grand event was when the barn took fire , His world the parish , and his king the squire . Nor clock nor kalend kept account with time , Suns told his days , his weeks the sabbath chime ; His spring the jasmine silvering round his door , And reddening apples spoke of summer o'er . To him the orb that set o'er yonder trees , Tired like himself , lit no antipodes ; And the vast world of human fears and hopes Closed to his sight where yon horizon slopes ,— That beech which now o'ershadows half the way , He saw it planted in my grandsire 's day ; Rooted alike where first they braved the weather , He and the oaks he loved grew old together . Not ten miles distant stands our County-hall — To him remoter than to thee Bengal ; And the next shire appear 'd to him to be What seas that closed on Franklin seem to thee . Thus tranquil on that happy ignorance bore The green old age still hearty at fourscore ; To him , or me — with half the world explored , And half his years — did life the more afford ? There the grey hairs , and here the furrow 'd breast ! Ask , first — is life a journey or a rest ? If rest , old Man , long life indeed was thine ; But if a journey — oh , how short to mine ! THE MIND AND THE HEART . “ MA VIE C'EST UN COMBAT . ” Why , ever wringing life from art Do men my patient labour find ? I still the murmur of my heart , My one consoler is my mind . Though every toil but wakes the spell To rouse the Falsehood and the Foe , Can all the storms that chafe the well , Disturb the silent TRUTH below ? The Mind can reign in Mind alone .— O Pride , the hollow boast confess ! What slave would not reject a throne If built amidst a wilderness ? Before my gaze I see my youth , The ghost of gentler years , arise , With looks that yearn 'd for every truth , And wings that sought the farthest skies . Fresh from the golden land of dreams , Before this waking world began , How bright the radiant phantom seems Beside the time-worn weary man ! How , then , the Heart rejoiced in all That roused the quick aspiring Mind ! What glorious music Hope could call From every Memory left behind ! Experience drew not then to earth The looks that Fancy rear 'd above , And all that took their kindred birth From thought or feeling ,— blent in love . In vain a seraph 's hand had raised The mask from Falsehood 's fatal brow ; And still as fondly I had gazed On looks that freeze to marble now . Can aught that Mind bestows on toil Replace the earlier heavenly ray , That did but tremble o'er the soil , To warm creation into May ? But now , in Autumn 's hollow sigh , The heart its waning season shows , And all the clearness of the sky Foretells the coming of the snows . Farewell , sweet season of the Heart , And come , O iron rule of Mind , I see the Golden Age depart , And face the war it leaves behind . Me nevermore may Feeling thrall , Resign 'd to Reason 's stoic reign — But oh , how much of what we call Content — is nothing but Disdain ! THE LAST CRUSADER . Left to the Saviour 's conquering foes , The land that girds the Saviour 's grave ; Where Godfrey 's crosier-standard rose , He saw the crescent-banner wave . There , o'er the gently-broken vale , The halo-light on Zion glow 'd ; There Kedron , with a voice of wail , By tombs [ F ] of saints and heroes flow 'd ; There still the olives silver o'er The dimness of the distant hill ; There still the flowers that Sharon bore , Calm air with many an odour fill . Slowly THE LAST CRUSADER eyed The towers , the mount , the stream , the plain , And thought of those whose blood had dyed The earth with crimson streams in vain ! He thought of that sublime array , The Hosts , that over land and deep The Hermit marshall 'd on their way , To see those towers , and halt to weep ! [ G ] Resign 'd the loved familiar lands , O'er burning wastes the cross to bear , And rescue from the Paynim 's hands The empire of a sepulchre ! And vain the hope , and vain the loss , And vain the famine and the strife ; In vain the faith that bore the Cross , The valour prodigal of life ! And vain was Richard 's lion-soul , And guileless Godfrey 's patient mind — Like waves on shore , they reach 'd the goal , To die , and leave no trace behind ! “ O God ! ” the last Crusader cried , “ And art thou careless of thine own ? For us thy Son in Salem died , And Salem is the scoffer 's throne ! “ And shall we leave , from age to age , To godless hands the Holy Tomb ? Against thy saints the heathen rage — Launch forth thy lightnings , and consume ! ” Swift , as he spoke , before his sight A form flash 'd , white-robed , from above ; All Heaven was in those looks of light , But Heaven , whose native air is love . “ Alas ! ” the solemn Vision said , “ Thy God is of the shield and spear — To bless the Quick and raise the Dead , The Saviour-God descended here ! “ Ask not the Father to reward The hearts that seek , through blood , the Son ; O warrior ! never by the sword The Saviour 's Holy Land is won ! ” [ F ] The valley Jehoshaphat , through which rolls the torrent of the Kedron , is studded with tombs . [ G ] See Tasso , Ger . Lib . cant . iii . st. vi . FOREBODINGS . What are ye ?— Strangers from the Phantom shore ? Lights that precede Funereal Destinies , Ev'n as the Spectres of the Sun , before He rises from the dearth of Arctic seas ? What demon presence haunts the haggard air ? What ice-wind checks the blood and lifts the hair ? What are ye ?— “ Nightmares known not to the sane , A sick man 's sickly dreams ” — the Leech replies , Then prates he much of viscera , spleen , and brain , And lays the Ghost with Galen ;— “ To the wise All things are matter ; ” well , we would be taught , Come , Leech , dissect the brain ;— Now show me Thought ! Shame !— to the body , must the soul fulfil A slavery thus subjected and entire ? Must every crevice into light be still Choked with the clod ? Each dread , and each desire Of things unknown , be track 'd unto its germ In some crazed fibre rotting to the worm ? Trust we the dry philosophies that sneer Back every guess into the world of spirit , And what were left the present to revere ? And where would fade the future we inherit ? Try Heaven and Hell by the physician 's test , And men know neither — while they well digest ! What mortal hand the airy line can draw ‘ Twixt Superstition in its shadowy terror And still Religion in its starry awe ?— Truth when sublime flows least distinct from error ; Light of itself eludes our human eyes ; Let it take colour , and it spans the skies ! Doubtful Foreshadows , have ye then of yore Never been prophets , murmuring weal or woe ? Beckoning no Sylla over seas of gore ? Warning no Julius of the fatal blow ? Seen in no mother-guise by that pale son Who led the Mede , and sleeps in Marathon ? [ H ] You , the Earth-shakers from whose right hands war Falls , as from Jove 's the thunderbolt , obey ; Gaul 's sceptic Caesar had his guardian star , Stout Cromwell 's iron creed its chosen day . ‘ Tis in proportion as men 's lives are great , That , fates themselves ,— they glass the shades of Fate . The wisest sage the antique wisdom knew , Gazing into blue space long silent hours , Would commune with his Genius : as the dew Recruits the river , so the unseen Powers Of Nature feed with thoughts spiritual , soul .— Belief alone links knowledge to The Whole . Hail , then , each gleam , albeit of angry skies , Terrible never to the noble sight ! Hail the dread lightning , if it lift the eyes Up from the dust into the Infinite ! Look through thy grate , thou saddest captive , Doubt , And thank the flash that shows a Heaven without . [ H ] Hippias , before the battle of Marathon , in which he was slain , dreamt a dream that he slept with his mother .— See Herodotus . ORAMA ; OR , FATE AND FREEWILL . Thin , shadowy , scarce divided from the light , I saw a phantom at the birth of morn : Its robe was sable , but a fleecy white Flow 'd silvering o'er the garb of gloom ; a horn It held within its hand ; no faintest breath Stirr 'd its wan lips — death-like , it seem 'd not Death . My heart lay numb within me ; and the flow Of life , like water under icebergs , crept ; The pulses of my being seem 'd to grow One awe ;— voice fled the body as it slept , But from its startled depth arose the soul And king-like spoke :— “ What art thou , that dost seem To have o'er Immortality control ? ” And the Shape answer 'd , not by sound , “ A Dream ! A Dream , but not a Dream : the Shade of things To come — a herald from the throne of Fate . I ruled the hearts of earth 's primaeval kings , I gave their life its impulse and its date : Grey Wisdom paled before me , and the stars Were made my weird interpreters — my hand Aroused the whirlwind of the destined wars , And bow 'd the nations to my still command . A Dream , but not a Dream ;— a type , a sign , Pale with the Future , do I come to thee . The lot of Man is twofold ; gaze on thine , And choose thy path into eternity . ” Thus spoke the Shade ; and as when autumn 's haze Rolls from a ghostly hill , and gives to view The various life of troubled human days , So round the phantom , pale phantasma grew , And landscapes rose on either side the still River of Time , whose waves are human hours .— “ What , ” said my soul , “ doth not the Omniscient Will Foreshape , foredoom ; if so , what choice is ours ? ” The Ghost replied :— “ Deem'st thou the art divine Less than the human ? Doth inventive Man All adverse means in one great end combine , And close each circle where the thought began , So that his genius , bent on schemes sublime , Scarce notes the obstructions to its purposed goal , But turns each discord of the changeful time Into the music of a changeless whole ? And deem'st thou Him who breathes , and worlds arise , But the blind agent of His own cold law ? Fool ! doth yon river less reflect the skies Because some wavelet eddies round a straw ? Still to Man 's choice is either margin given Beside the Stream of Time to wander free : And still , as nourish 'd by the dews of Heaven , Glides the sure river to the solemn sea . Choose as thou wilt ! ” — Then luminously clear Flash 'd either margin from the vapoury shade ; What I beheld unmeet for mortal ear ,— Nor dare I tell the choice the mortal made . But when the Shape had left me , and the dawn Smote the high lattice with a starbeam pale , As a blind man when from his sight withdrawn The film of dark ,— or as unto the gale Leaps the live war-ship from the leaden calm ,— So joyous rose , look 'd forth , and on to Fate Bounded my soul ! Yet nor the Olympian palm Which fierce contestors hotly emulate , Nor roseate blooms in Cytherean dell , Nor laurel shadowing murmurous Helicon , Strain 'd my desire divinely visible In the lone course it was my choice to run . Wherefore was then my joy ?— THAT I WAS FREE ! Not my life doom 'd , as I had deem 'd till then , An iron link of grim Necessity ,— A sand-grain wedged amidst the walls of men ; The good , the ill , the happiness or woe , That waited , not a thraldom pre-decreed , But from myself as from their germ to grow ,— Let the Man suffer , still the Slave was freed ! Predestine earth , and heavenly Mercy dies ; The voice of sorrow wastes its wail on air ; Freewill restores the Father to the skies , Unlocks from ice the living realm of prayer , And gives creation what the human heart Gives to the creature , life to life replying . O epoch in my being , and mine art , Known but to me !— How oft do thoughts undying Like rainbows , spring between the cloud and beam , Colouring the world yet painted on — a dream . EARLIER POEMS . CHIEFLY CRITICAL OR REFLECTIVE . [ A ] [ A ] These Poems , with one exception , have received but little alteration since they were first composed , and are taken from the little volume called “ Eva , &amp; c . ” The Poem called “ THE IDEAL WORLD , ” to which I refer as an exception , appeared in a much ruder form in the earlier editions of the “ Pilgrims of the Rhine , ” to which it served as a Preface . I recast , and , indeed , re-wrote it for the last edition of that work , from which ( with slight corrections , and the omission of the verses which connected the poem with the tale by which it was first accompanied ) it is now reprinted . THE SOULS OF BOOKS . I . Sit here and muse !— it is an antique room — High-roof 'd with casements , through whose purple pane Unwilling Daylight steals amidst the gloom , Shy as a fearful stranger . There THEY reign ( In loftier pomp than waking life had known ) , The Kings of Thought !— not crown 'd until the grave . When Agamemnon sinks into the tomb , The beggar Homer mounts the Monarch 's throne ! Ye ever-living and imperial Souls , Who rule us from the page in which ye breathe , All that divide us from the clod ye gave ! Law — Order — Love — Intelligence — the Sense Of Beauty — Music and the Minstrel 's wreath !— What were our wanderings if without your goals ? As air and light , the glory ye dispense , Becomes our being — who of us can tell What he had been , had Cadmus never taught The art that fixes into form the thought — Had Plato never spoken from his cell , Or his high harp blind Homer never strung ?— Kinder all earth hath grown since genial Shakspeare sung ! II . Hark ! while we muse , without the walls is heard The various murmur of the labouring crowd , How still , within those archive-cells interr 'd , The Calm Ones reign !— and yet they rouse the loud Passions and tumults of the circling world ! From them , how many a youthful Tully caught The zest and ardour of the eager Bar ; From them , how many a young Ambition sought Gay meteors glancing o'er the sands afar — By them each restless wing has been unfurl 'd , And their ghosts urge each rival 's rushing car ! They made yon Preacher zealous for the truth ; They made yon Poet wistful for the star ; Gave Age its pastime — fired the cheek of Youth — The unseen sires of all our beings are ,— III . And now so still ! This , Cicero , is thy heart ; I hear it beating through each purple line . This is thyself , Anacreon — yet thou art Wreath 'd , as in Athens , with the Cnidian vine . I ope thy pages , Milton , and , behold Thy spirit meets me in the haunted ground ! Sublime and eloquent , as while , of old , “ It flamed and sparkled in its crystal bound ;"[ B ] These are yourselves — your life of life ! The Wise ( Minstrel or Sage ) out of their books are clay ; But in their books , as from their graves , they rise , Angels — that , side by side , upon our way , Walk with and warn us ! Hark ! the world so loud And they , the movers of the world , so still ! What gives this beauty to the grave ? the shroud Scarce wraps the Poet , than at once there cease Envy and Hate ! “ Nine cities claim him dead , Through which the living Homer begg 'd his bread ! ” And what the charm that can such health distil From wither 'd leaves — oft poisons in their bloom ? We call some books immoral ! Do they live ? If so , believe me , TIME hath made them pure . In Books , the veriest wicked rest in peace — God wills that nothing evil should endure ; The grosser parts fly off and leave the whole , As the dust leaves the disembodied soul ! Come from thy niche , Lucretius ! Thou didst give Man the black creed of Nothing in the tomb ! Well , when we read thee , does the dogma taint ? No ; with a listless eye we pass it o'er , And linger only on the hues that paint The Poet 's spirit lovelier than his lore . None learn from thee to cavil with their God ; None commune with thy genius to depart Without a loftier instinct of the heart . Thou mak'st no Atheist — thou but mak'st the mind Richer in gifts which Atheists best confute — FANCY AND THOUGHT ! ‘ Tis these that from the sod Lift us ! The life which soars above the brute Ever and mightiest , breathes from a great Poet 's lute ! Lo ! that grim Merriment of Hatred ; [ C ] — born Of him — the Master-Mocker of Mankind , Beside the grin of whose malignant spleen , Voltaire 's gay sarcasm seems a smile serene ,— Do we not place it in our children 's hands , Leading young Hope through Lemuel 's fabled lands ?— God 's and man 's libel in that foul yahoo !— Well , and what mischief can the libel do ? O impotence of Genius to belie Its glorious task — its mission from the sky ! Swift wrote this book to wreak a ribald scorn On aught the man should love or Priest should mourn — And lo ! the book , from all its ends beguiled , A harmless wonder to some happy child ! IV . All books grow homilies by time ; they are Temples , at once , and Landmarks . In them , we Who but for them , upon that inch of ground We call “ THE PRESENT , ” from the cell could see No daylight trembling on the dungeon bar ; Turn , as we list , the globe 's great axle round , Traverse all space , and number every star , And feel the Near less household than the Far ! There is no Past , so long as Books shall live ! A disinterr 'd Pompeii wakes again For him who seeks yon well ; lost cities give Up their untarnish 'd wonders , and the reign Of Jove revives and Saturn :— At our will Rise dome and tower on Delphi 's sacred hill ; Bloom Cimon 's trees in Academe ; [ D ] — along Leucadia 's headland sighs the Lesbian 's song ; With Egypt 's Queen once more we sail the Nile , And learn how worlds are barter 'd for a smile :— Rise up , ye walls , with gardens blooming o'er , Ope but that page — lo , Babylon once more ! V. Ye make the Past our heritage and home : And is this all ? No : by each prophet-sage — No ; by the herald souls that Greece and Rome Sent forth , like hymns , to greet the Morning Star That rose on Bethlehem — by thy golden page , Melodious Plato — by thy solemn dreams , World-wearied Tully !— and above ye all , By THIS , the Everlasting Monument Of God to mortals , on whose front the beams Flash glory-breathing day — our lights ye are To the dark Bourne beyond ; in you are sent The types of Truths whose life is THE TO-COME ; In you soars up the Adam from the fall ; In you the FUTURE as the PAST is given — Ev'n in our death ye bid us hail our birth ;— Unfold these pages , and behold the Heaven , Without one grave-stone left upon the Earth ! [ B ] “ Comus . ” [ C ] “ Gulliver 's Travels . ” [ D ] Plut . in “ Vit . Cim . ” LA ROCHEFOUCAULD AND CONDORCET Led by the Graces , through a court he moved , “ All men revered him , and all women loved ;"[ E ] — Happier than Paris , when to him there came The three Celestials — Learning , Love , and Fame , He found the art to soothe them all , and see The Golden Apple shared amidst the Three . Yet he , this man , for whom the world assumed Each rose that in Gargettian [ F ] gardens bloom 'd , Left to mankind a legacy of all That from earth 's sweetness can extract a gall . With him , indeed , poor Love is but a name — Virtue a mask — Beneficence a game . The Eternal Egotist , the Human Soul , Sees but in Self the starting-post and goal . Nipp 'd in the frost of that cold , glittering air , High thoughts are dwarf 'd , and youth 's warm dreams despair ! He lived in luxury , and he died in peace , And saints in powder wept at his decease ! Man loves this sparkling satire on himself ;— Gaze round — see Rochefoucauld on every shelf ! Look on the other ;— Penury made him sour , His learned youth the hireling slave of power ; His Manhood cast amidst the stormiest time , A hideous stage , half frenzy and all crime :— Upon the Dungeon 's floor of stone he died , With Life 's last Friend , his Horace , by his side ! Yet he — this Sage — who found the world so base , Left what ?— His “ Progress of the Human Race . ” A golden dream of man without a sin ; All virtue round him and all peace within ! Man does not love such portraits of himself , And thrusts the unwelcome Flatterer from the shelf . [ E ] “ The men respect you , and the women love you . ” — Such was the subtle compliment paid by Prior to one equally ambitious of either distinction ; viz . Henry St. John , Lord Bolingbroke . [ F ] Epicurean . JEALOUSY AND ART . If bright Apollo be the type of Art , So is flay 'd Marsyas that of Jealousy : With the bare fibres which for ever smart Under the sunbeams that rejoice the sky . Had Marsyas ask 'd not with the god to vie , The god had praised the cunning of his flute . Thou stealest half Apollo 's melody , Tune but thy reed in concert with his lute . Each should enrich the other — each enhance By his own gift the common Beautiful : That every colour more may charm the glance , All varying flowers the garland-weavers cull ; Adorn 'd by Contrast , Art no rival knows ,— The violet steals not perfume from the rose . THE MASTER TO THE SCHOLAR . Write for the pedant Few , the vein shall grow Cold at its source and meagre in its flow ; But for the vulgar Many wouldst thou write , How coarse the passion , and the thought how trite ! “ Nor Few , nor Many — riddles from thee fall ? ” Author , as Nature smiles — so write ;— for ALL ! THE TRUE CRITIC . Taste is to sense , as Charity to soul , A bias less to censure than to praise ; A quick perception of the arduous whole , Where the dull eye some careless flaw surveys . Every true critic — from the Stagirite To Schlegel and to Addison — hath won His fame by serving a reflected light , And clearing vapour from a clouded sun . Who envies him whose microscopic eyes See but the canker in the glorious rose ? Not much I ween the Zoilus we prize , Though even Homer may at moments doze . Praise not to me the sharp sarcastic sneer , Mocking the Fane which Genius builds to Time . High works are Sabbaths to the Soul ! Revere Even some rare discord in the solemn chime . When on the gaze the Venus dawns divine , The Cobbler comes the slipper to condemn ; The Slave alone descends into the mine To work the dross — the Monarch wears the gem . TALENT AND GENIUS . Talent convinces — Genius but excites ; This tasks the reason , that the soul delights . Talent from sober judgment takes its birth , And reconciles the pinion to the earth ; Genius unsettles with desires the mind , Contented not till earth be left behind ; Talent , the sunshine on a cultured soil ; Ripens the fruit , by slow degrees , for toil ; Genius , the sudden Iris of the skies , On cloud itself reflects its wondrous dyes : And to the earth , in tears and glory , given , Clasps in its airy arch the pomp of Heaven ! Talent gives all that vulgar critics need — And frames a horn-book for the Dull to read ; Genius , the Pythian of the Beautiful , Leaves its large truths a riddle to the Dull — From eyes profane a veil the Isis screens , And fools on fools still ask — “ What Hamlet means ? ” EURIPIDES . If in less stately mould thy thoughts were cast Than thy twin Masters of the Grecian stage , Lone , ‘ mid the loftier wonders of the Past , Thou stand'st — more household to the Modern Age ;— Thou mark'st that change in Manners when the frown Of the vast Titans vanish 'd from the earth , When a more soft Philosophy stole down From the dark heavens to man 's familiar hearth . With thee came Love and Woman 's influence o'er Her sterner Lord ; and Poesy , till then A Sculpture , warm 'd to Painting ; [ G ] what before Glass 'd but the dim-seen Gods , grew now to men Clear mirrors , and the Passions took their place , Where a serene if solemn Awe had made The scene a temple to the elder race : The struggles of Humanity became Not those of Titan with a God , nor those Of the great Heart with that unbodied Name By which our ignorance would explain our woes And justify the Heavens ,— relentless FATE ;— But , truer to the human life , thine art Made thought with thought , and will with will debate , And placed the God and Titan in the Heart ; Thy Phaedra and thy pale Medea were The birth of that most subtle wisdom , which Dawn 'd in the world with Socrates , to bear Its last most precious offspring in the rich And genial soul of Shakspeare . And for this Wit blamed thee living , Dulness taunts thee dead . [ H ] And yet the Pythian did not speak amiss When in thy verse the latent truths she read , And hail 'd thee wiser than thy tribe . [ I ] Of thee All genius in our softer times hath been The grateful echo ; and thy soul we see Still through our tears — upon the later Scene . Doth the Italian for his frigid thought Steal but a natural pathos ,— hath the Gaul To mimes that ape the form of heroes taught One step that reels not underneath the pall Of the dark Muse — this praise we give , nor more They just remind us — thou hast lived before ! But that which made thee wiser than the Schools Was the long sadness of a much-wrong 'd life ; The sneer of satire , and the gibe of fools , The broken hearth-gods and the perjured wife . For Sorrow is the messenger between The Poet and Men 's bosoms :— Genius can Fill with unsympathizing Gods the Scene , But Grief alone can teach us what is Man ! [ G ] The celebrated comparison between Sculpture and the Ancient Painting and the Modern Dramatic Poetry , is not applicable to Euripides , who has a warmth and colour of passion which few , indeed , of the moderns have surpassed , and from which most of the modern writers have mediately , if not directly , borrowed their most animated conceptions . [ H ] Among the taunting accusations which Aristophanes , in his Comedy of the Frogs , lavishes upon Euripides , through the medium of AEschylus , is that of having introduced female love upon the stage ! AEschylus , indeed , is made , very inconsistently , considering his Clytemnestra ( Ran . 1 . 1042 ) to declare that he does not know that he ever represented a single woman in love . At a previous period of the comedy , Euripides is also ridiculed , through a boast ironically assigned to his own lips , for having debased Tragedy by the introduction of domestic interest — ( household things , [ Greek : oikeia pragmata ]) . Upon these and similar charges have later critics , partly in England , especially in Germany , sought by duller diatribes to perpetuate a spirit of depreciation against the only ancient tragic poet who has vitally influenced the later stage . The true merit of Euripides is seen in the very ridicule of Aristophanes . [ I ] “ Wise Sophocles , wiser Euripides , wisest of all , Socrates , ” was the well-known decision of the Delphian Oracle . Yet the wisdom of Euripides was not in the philosophical sentences with which he often mars the true philosophy of the drama . His wisdom is his pathos . THE BONES OF RAPHAEL . When the author was in Rome , in the year 1833 , the bones of Raphael were discovered , and laid for several days in state in one of the churches . Wave upon wave , the human ocean stream 'd Along the chancel of the solemn pile ; And , with a softer day , the tapers beam 'd Upon the Bier within the vaulted aisle :— And , mingled with the crowd , I halted there And ask 'd a Roman scholar by my side , What sainted dust invoked the common prayer ? “ Stranger ! ” the man , as in disdain , replied , “ Nine days already hath the Disinterr 'd Been given again to mortal eye , and all The great of Rome , the Conclave and the Pope , Have flock 'd to grace the second funeral Of him whose soul , until it fled , like Hope , Gave Beauty to the World :— But haply thou , A dweller of the North , hast never heard Of one who , if no saint in waking life , Communed in dreams with angels , and transferr 'd The heaven in which we trust his soul is now To the mute canvas .— Underneath that pall Repose the bones of Raphael ! ” Not a word I answer 'd , but in awe I drew more near , And saw the crowd toil on in busy strife , Eager which first should touch the holy bier , I ask 'd a boor , more earnest than the rest , “ Whose bones are these ? ” “ I know not what his name ; But , since the Pope and Conclave have been here , Doubtless a famous Saint ! ” The Boor express 'd The very thought the wandering stranger guess 'd . Which wiser , he , the Scholar , who had sneer 'd To hear the Stranger canonize the Dead ; Or they , the Boor , the Stranger , who revered The Saint , where he the Artist ?— Answer , Fame , Whose Saints are not the Calendar 's ! Perchance Tasso and Raphael , age to age , have given The earth a lustre more direct from Heaven Than San Gennaro , or thy Dennis , France ; Or English George !— Read History . [ J ] — When the crowd Were gone , I slipp 'd some coins into the hand Of a grave-visaged Priest , who took his stand Beside the Bier , and bade him lift the shroud ; And there I paused , and gazed upon the all The Worm had spared to Raphael .— He had died , As sang the Alfieri of our land , In the embrace of Beauty [ K ] — beautiful Himself as Cynthia 's lover !— That , the skull Once pillow 'd on soft bosoms , which still rise With passionate life , in canvas ;— in the void Of those blank sockets shone the starry eyes , That , like the stars , found home in heaven ! The pall With its dark hues , gave forth , in gleaming white , The delicate bones ; for still an undestroy 'd Beauty , amidst decay , appear 'd to dwell About the mournful relics ; and the light , In crownlike halo , lovingly did fall On the broad brow ,— the hush 'd and ruin 'd cell Of the old Art — Nature 's sweet Oracle ! Believe or not , no horror seem 'd to wrap What has most horror for our life — the Dead : The sleep slept soft , as in a mother 's lap , As if the Genius of the Grecian Death , That with a kiss inhaled the parting breath , That , wing 'd for Heaven , stood by the charnel porch , Lowering , with looks of love , th ’ extinguish 'd torch , Had taken watch beside the narrow bed ; And from the wrecks of the beloved clay Had scared , with guardian eyes , each ghastlier shape away ! Come , Moralist , with truths of tritest worth , And tell us how “ to this complexion ” all That beautify the melancholy earth “ Must come at last ! ” The little and the low , The mob of common men , rejoice to know How the grave levels with themselves the great : For something in the envy of the small Still loves the vast Democracy of Death ! But flatter not yourselves — in death the fate Of Genius still divides itself from yours : Yea , ev'n upon the earth ! For Genius lives Not in your life — it does not breathe your breath , It does not share your charnels ;— but insures In death itself the life that life survives ! Genius to you what most you value gave , The noisy forum and the glittering mart , The solid goods and mammon of the world , In these your life — and these with life depart ! Grudge not what Genius to itself shall claim — A life that lived but in the dreams of Art , A world whose sunshine was the smile from Fame . These die not , Moralist , when all are hurl 'd , Fasces and sceptre , in the common grave :— Genius , in life or death , is still the same — Death but makes deathless what Life ask 'd — THE NAME . [ J ] Gibbon , after a powerful sketch of the fraud , the corruption , and the vices of George the Cappadocian , thus concludes :— “ The odious stranger , disguising every circumstance of time and place , assumed the mask of a martyr , a saint , and a Christian hero ; and the infamous George of Cappadocia has been transformed into the renowned St. George of England , the patron of arms , of chivalry , and the garter . ” — Gibbon 's Decline and Fall , vol . iv . c. xxiii . [ K ] “ Italian Beauty ! didst thou not inspire Raphael , who died in thy embrace ? ” — BYRON . THE ATHENIAN AND THE SPARTAN . A DIALOGUE . THE ATHENIAN . Stern Prisoner in thy rites of old , To Learning blind , to Beauty cold ,— Never for thee , with garlands crown 'd , The lyre and myrtle circle round ; Dull to the Lesbian ruby 's froth , Thou revellest in thy verjuice broth . With Phidian art our temples shine , Like mansions meet for gods divine ; Thou think'st thy gods despise such toys , And shrines are made — for scourging boys , As triflers , thou canst only see The Drama 's Kings — our glorious Three . No Plato fires your youth to thinking , Your nobler school ,— in Helots drinking ! Contented as your sires before — The Little makes ye loathe The More . We , ever pushing forward , still Take power , where powerless , from the will ; We , ever straining at the All , With hands that grasp when feet may fall , [ L ] — Earth , ocean ,— near and far ,— we roam , Where Fame , where Fortune ,— there a home ! You hold all progress degradation , Improvement but degeneration , And only wear your scarlet coat When self-defence must cut a throat . Yet ev'n in war , your only calling , A snail would beat your best at crawling ; We slew the Mede at Marathon , While you were gazing at the moon ! [ M ] Pshaw , man , lay by these antique graces , True wisdom hates such solemn faces ! Spartans , if only livelier fellows , Would make ev'n US a little jealous ! THE SPARTAN ( calmly ) . Friend , Spartans when they need improvement Take models not from endless movement . We found our sires the lords of Greece ;— Ask 'd why ? this answer — “ Laws and Peace . ” Enough for us to hold our own ; Who grasps at shadows risks the bone . You 're ever up , and ever down ,— There 's something fix 'd in True Renown . The New has charms for men , I 'm told ; Granted ,— but all our gods are old . Better to imitate a god Than shift like men . THE ATHENIAN ( impatiently ) . You are so odd ! There is no sense in these laconics . Ho , Dromio ! bring my last Platonics . This mode of arguing , though emphatic , Is quite eclipsed by the Socratic . SPARTAN . Friend — ATHENIAN . You have said . Now listen ! Peace ! SPARTAN . Friend — ATHENIAN . Gods ! his tongue will never cease ! I tell you , man is made for walking , Not standing still . SPARTAN . My friend — ATHENIAN . And talking ! Forward 's my motto — life and motion ! SPARTAN . Mine be the Rock , as thine the Ocean . TIME . Discuss , ye symbols of the twain Great Creeds — THE STEADFAST AND IMPROVING ; The one shall rot that would remain , The one wear out in moving ! [ L ] Thucyd . lib . 1 , c. 68-71 ( The Speech of the Corinthians ) . [ M ] Herod . lib . 6 , c. 120 . THE PHILANTHROPIST AND THE MISANTHROPE . A DIALOGUE . THE PHILANTHROPIST . Yes , thou mayst sneer , but still I own A love that spreads from zone to zone : No time the sacred fire can smother ! Where breathes the man , I hail the brother . Man ! how sublime ,— from Heaven his birth — The God 's bright Image walks the earth ! And if , at times , his footstep strays , I pity where I may not praise . THE MISANTHROPE . Thou lov'st mankind . Pray tell me , then , What history best excuses men ? Long wars for slight pretences made , See murder but a glorious trade ; Each landmark from the savage state , Doth virtue or a vice create ? Do ships speed plenty o'er the main ?— What swells the sail ? The lust of gain ! What makes a law where laws were not ? Strength 's wish to keep what Strength has got ! If rise a Few — the true Sublime , Who lend the light of Heaven to Time , What the return the Many make ? The poison 'd bowl ! the fiery stake ! Thou lov'st mankind ,— come tell me , then , Lov'st thou the past career of men ? THE PHILANTHROPIST . Nay , little should I love mankind , If their dark PAST my praise could find , It is because — THE MISANTHROPE . A moment hold ! Enough gone times : our own behold ! What lessons doth a past of woe And crime upon our age bestow ? How few amongst the tribes of earth Are rescued from the primal wild ; What countless lands the ocean 's girth , By savage rites and gore defil 'd ! Afric — a mart of human flesh ; Asia — a satrapy of slaves ! And yonder tracts from Nature fresh , Worn empires fill with knaves ? Are men at home more good and wise ? My friend , thou read'st the daily papers ; Perchance , thou seest but laughing skies , Where I but mists and vapours . But much the same seems each disease . What most improved ? The doctor 's fees ! The Law can still oppress the Weak , The Proud still march before the Meek . Still crabbed Age and heedless Youth ; Still Power perplex 'd , asks “ What is Truth ? ” To no result our squabbles come : To some what 's best is worst to some . The few the cake amongst them carve , And labourers sweat and poets starve ; And Envy still on Genius feeds , And not one modest man succeeds . All much the same for prince and peasant — I 've done .— How dost thou love the PRESENT ? THE PHILANTHROPIST . ‘ Tis not man 's Present or man 's Past ; Beyond , man 's friend his eye must cast . Must see him break each galling fetter ; To gain the best , desire the better — From Discontent itself we borrow The glorious yearnings for the morrow ; Science and Truth like waves advance Upon the antique Ignorance . THE MISANTHROPE . Like waves — the image not amiss ! They gain on that side — lose on this ; Pleased , after fifty ages , if They gulp at last an inch of cliff . THE PHILANTHROPIST . You really cannot think by satire , To mine the truths you cannot batter ; Man 's destinies are brightening slowly , With them entwined each thought most holy . What though the PAST my horror moves , No Eden though the PRESENT seems , Who loves Mankind , their FUTURE loves , And trusts , and lives — THE MISANTHROPE . In dreams ! WISDOM . In both extremes there seems convey 'd , A truth to own , and yet deny ; But what between the extremes has made The master-difference ? HOPE . I !— What wert thou , Wisdom , but for me ? Though thou the Past , the Present see , Through ME alone , the eye can mark The Future dawning on the dark . I plant the tree , and till the soil ; I show the fruit ,— where thou the toil ; Where thou despondest , I aspire — Thine sad Content , mine bright Desire . Under my earthlier name of HOPE , The love to things unborn is given , But call me FAITH — behold I ope The flaming gates of Heaven ! Take ME from Man , and Man is both The Dastard and the Slave ; And Love is lust , and Peace a sloth , And all the Earth a Grave ! THE IDEAL WORLD . ARGUMENT . SECTION I . The Ideal World — Its realm is everywhere around us — Its inhabitants are the immortal personifications of all beautiful thoughts — To that World we attain by the repose of the senses . SECTION II . Our dreams belong to the Ideal — The diviner love for which youth sighs , not attainable in life — But the pursuit of that love , beyond the world of the senses , purifies the soul , and awakes the Genius — Instances in Petrarch — Dante . SECTION III . Genius , lifting its life to the Ideal becomes itself a pure idea — It must comprehend all existence : all human sins and sufferings — But , in comprehending , it transmutes them — The Poet in his twofold being — The actual and the ideal — The influence of Genius over the sternest realities of earth — Over our passions — wars and superstitions — Its identity is with human progress — Its agency , even where unacknowledged , is universal . SECTION IV . Forgiveness to the errors of our benefactors . SECTION V. The Ideal is not confined to Poets — Algernon Sydney recognizes his Ideal in liberty , and believes in its triumph where the mere practical man could behold but its ruins — Yet liberty in this world must ever be an Ideal , and the land that it promises can be found but in death . SECTION VI . Yet all have two escapes into the Ideal World ; viz . Memory and Hope — Example of Hope in youth , however excluded from action and desire — Napoleon 's son . SECTION VII . Example of Memory as leading to the Ideal — Amidst life , however humble , and in a mind however ignorant — the village widow . SECTION VIII . Hence in Hope , Memory , and Prayer , all of us are Poets . I . Around “ this visible diurnal sphere , ” There floats a world that girds us like the space ; On wandering clouds and gliding beams career Its ever-moving , murmurous Populace . There , all the lovelier thoughts conceived below , Ascending live , and in celestial shapes . To that bright World , O Mortal , wouldst thou go ?— Bind but thy senses , and thy soul escapes : To care , to sin , to passion close thine eyes ; Sleep in the flesh , and see the Dreamland rise ! Hark , to the gush of golden waterfalls , Or knightly tromps at Archimagian walls ! In the green hush of Dorian Valleys mark The River Maid her amber tresses knitting :— When glow-worms twinkle under coverts dark , And silver clouds o'er summer stars are flitting , With jocund elves invade “ the Moone 's sphere , Or hang a pearl in every cowslip 's ear ;"[ N ] Or , list ! what time the roseate urns of dawn Scatter fresh dews , and the first skylark weaves Joy into song — the blithe Arcadian Faun Piping to wood-nymphs under Bromian leaves , While , slowly gleaming through the purple glade , Come Evian 's panther car , and the pale Naxian Maid . Such , O Ideal World , thy habitants ! All the fair children of creative creeds — All the lost tribes of Phantasy are thine — From antique Saturn in Dodonian haunts , Or Pan 's first music waked from shepherd reeds , To the last sprite when heaven 's pale lamps decline , Heard wailing soft along the solemn Rhine . II . Thine are the Dreams that pass the Ivory Gates , With prophet shadows haunting poet eyes ! Thine the beloved illusions youth creates From the dim haze of its own happy skies . In vain we pine — we yearn on earth to win The being of the heart , our boyhood 's dream . The Psyche and the Eros ne'er have been , Save in Olympus , wedded !— As a stream Glasses a star , so life the ideal love ; Restless the stream below — serene the orb above ! Ever the soul the senses shall deceive ; Here custom chill , there kinder fate bereave : For mortal lips unmeet eternal vows ! And Eden-flowers for Adam 's mournful brows ! We seek to make the moment 's angel-guest The household dweller at a human hearth ; We chase the bird of Paradise , whose nest Was never found amid the bowers of earth . [ O ] Yet loftier joys the vain pursuit may bring , Than sate the senses with the boons of time ; The bird of Heaven hath still an upward wing , The steps it lures are still the steps that climb , And in the ascent , although the soil be bare , More clear the daylight and more pure the air . Let Petrarch 's heart the human mistress lose , He mourns the Laura , but to win the Muse : Could all the charms which Georgian maids combine Delight the soul of the dark Florentine , Like one chaste dream of childlike Beatrice Awaiting Hell 's stern pilgrim in the skies , Snatch 'd from below to be the guide above , And clothe Religion in the form of Love ? [ P ] III . O , thou true Iris ! sporting on thy bow Of tears and smiles — Jove 's herald , Poetry ! Thou reflex image of all joy and woe — Both fused in light by thy dear phantasy ! Lo ! from the clay how Genius lifts its life , And grows one pure Idea — one calm soul ! True , its own clearness must reflect our strife ; True , its completeness must comprise our whole : But as the sun transmutes the sullen hues Of marsh-grown vapours into vermeil dyes , And melts them later into twilight dews , Shedding on flowers the baptism of the skies ; So glows the Ideal in the air we breathe — So from the fumes of sorrow and of sin , Doth its warm light in rosy colours wreathe Its playful cloudland , storing balms within . Survey the Poet in his mortal mould Man amongst men , descended from his throne ! The moth that chased the star now frets the fold , Our cares , our faults , our follies are his own . Passions as idle , and desires as vain , Vex the wild heart , and dupe the erring brain . From Freedom 's field the recreant Horace flies To kiss the hand by which his country dies ; From Mary 's grave the mighty Peasant turns , And hoarse with orgies rings the laugh of Burns . While Rousseau 's lips a lackey 's vices own ,— Lips that could draw the thunder on a throne ! But when , from Life the Actual , GENIUS springs , When , self-transform 'd by its own Magic rod , It snaps the fetters and expands the wings , And drops the fleshly garb that veil 'd the god , How the mists vanish as the form ascends !— How in its aureole every sunbeam blends ! By the Arch-Brightener of Creation seen , How dim the crowns on perishable brows ! The snows of Atlas melt beneath the sheen , Through Thebaid caves the rushing splendour flows , Cimmerian glooms with Asian beams are bright , And Earth reposes in a belt of light . Now stern as Vengeance shines the awful form , Arm 'd with the bolt and glowing through the storm ; Sets the great deeps of human passion free , And whelms the bulwarks that would breast the sea . Roused by its voice the ghastly Wars arise , Mars reddens earth , the Valkyrs pale the skies ; Dim Superstition from her hell escapes , With all her shadowy brood of monster shapes ; Here Life itself lie scowl of Typhon [ Q ] takes ; There Conscience shudders at Alecto 's snakes ; From Gothic graves at midnight yawning wide , In gory cerements gibbering spectres glide ; And where o'er blasted heaths the lightnings flame , Black secret hags “ do deeds without a name ! ” Yet through its direst agencies of awe , Light marks its presence and pervades its law , And , like Orion when the storms are loud , It links creation while it gilds a cloud . By ruthless Thor , free Thought , frank Honour stand , Fame 's grand desire , and zeal for Fatherland ; The grim Religion of Barbarian Fear , With some Hereafter still connects the Here , Lifts the gross sense to some spiritual source , And thrones some Jove above the Titan Force , Till , love completing what in awe began , From the rude savage dawns the thoughtful man . Then , O behold the glorious Comforter ! Still bright'ning worlds , but gladd'ning now the hearth , Or like the lustre of our nearest star , Fused in the common atmosphere of earth . It sports like hope upon the captive 's chain ; Descends in dreams upon the couch of pain ; To wonder 's realm allures the earnest child ; To the chaste love refines the instinct wild ; And as in waters the reflected beam , Still where we turn , glides with us up the stream ; And while in truth the whole expanse is bright , Yields to each eye its own fond path of light , So over life the rays of Genius fall ,— Give each his track because illuming all . IV . Hence is that secret pardon we bestow In the true instinct of the grateful heart , Upon the Sons of Song . The good they do In the clear world of their Uranian art Endures for ever ; while the evil done In the poor drama of their mortal scene , Is but a passing cloud before the sun ; Space hath no record where the mist hath been . Boots it to us , if Shakspeare err 'd like man ? Why idly question that most mystic life ? Eno ’ the giver in his gifts to scan ; To bless the sheaves with which thy fields are rife , Nor , blundering , guess through what obstructive clay The glorious corn-seed struggled up to day . V. But not to you alone , O Sons of Song , The wings that float the loftier airs along . Whoever lifts us from the dust we are , Beyond the sensual to spiritual goals ; Who from the MOMENT and the SELF afar By deathless deeds allures reluctant souls , Gives the warm life to what the Limner draws , Plato but thought what godlike Cato was . [ R ] Recall the wars of England 's giant-born , Is Elyot 's voice — is Hampden 's death in vain ? Have all the meteors of the vernal morn But wasted light upon a frozen main ? Where is that child of Carnage , Freedom , flown ? The Sybarite lolls upon the Martyr 's throne , Lewd , ribald jests succeed to solemn zeal ; And things of silk to Cromwell 's men of steel . Cold are the hosts the tromps of Ireton thrill 'd , And hush 'd the senates Vane 's large presence fill 'd . In what strong heart doth the old manhood dwell ? Where art thou Freedom ?— Look — in Sidney 's cell ! There still as stately stands the living Truth , Smiling on age as it had smiled on youth . Her forts dismantled , and her shrines o'erthrown , The headsman 's block her last dread altar-stone , No sanction left to Reason 's vulgar hope — Far from the wrecks expands her prophet 's scope . Millennial morns the tombs of Kedron gild , The hands of saints the glorious walls rebuild ,— Till , each foundation garnish 'd with its gem , High o'er Gehenna flames Jerusalem ! O thou blood-stain 'd Ideal of the free , Whose breath is heard in clarions — Liberty ! Sublimer for thy grand illusions past , Thou spring'st to Heaven — Religion at the last . Alike below , or commonwealths , or thrones , Where'er men gather some crush 'd victim groans ; Only in death thy real form we see , All life is bondage — souls alone are free . Thus through the waste the wandering Hebrews went , Fire on the march , but cloud upon the tent . At last on Pisgah see the prophet stand , Before his vision spreads the PROMISED LAND ; But where reveal 'd the Canaan to his eye ?— Upon the mountain he ascends to die . VI . Yet whatsoever be our bondage here , All have two portals to the Phantom sphere ,— Who hath not glided through those gates that ope , Beyond the Hour , to MEMORY or to HOPE ! Give Youth the Garden ,— still it soars above — Seeks some far glory — some diviner love . Place Age amidst the Golgotha — its eyes Still quit the graves , to rest upon the skies ; And while the dust , unheeded , moulders there , Track some lost angel through cerulean air . Lo ! where the Austrian binds , with formal chain , The crownless son of earth 's last Charlemain — Him , at whose birth laugh 'd all the violet vales ( While yet unfallen stood thy sovereign star , O Lucifer of Nations ) — hark , the gales Swell with the victor-shout from hosts , whose war Rended the Alps , and crimson 'd Memphian Nile — “ Way for the coming of the Conqueror 's Son : Woe to the Merchant-Carthage of the Isle ! Woe to the Scythian Ice-world of the Don ! O Thunder Lord , thy Lemnian bolts prepare , The Eagle 's eyrie hath its eagle heir ! ” Hark , at that shout from north to south , grey Power Quails on its weak , hereditary thrones ; And widow 'd mothers prophesy the hour Of future carnage to their cradled sons . What ! shall our race to blood be thus consign 'd , And Ate claim an heirloom in mankind ? Are these red lots unshaken in the urn ? Years pass — approach , pale Questioner — and learn Chain 'd to his rock , with brows that vainly frown , The fallen Titan sinks in darkness down ! And sadly gazing through his gilded grate , Behold the child whose birth , was as a fate ! Far from the land in which his life began ; Wall 'd from the healthful air of hardy man ; Rear 'd by cold hearts , and watch 'd by jealous eyes , His guardians jailors , and his comrades spies . Each trite convention courtly fears inspire To stint experience and to dwarf desire , Narrows the action to a puppet stage , And trains the eaglet to the starling 's cage . On the dejected brow and smileless cheek , What weary thought the languid lines bespeak : Till drop by drop , from jaded day to day , The sickly life-streams ooze themselves away . Yet oft in HOPE a boundless realm was thine , That vaguest Infinite — the Dream of Fame ; Son of the sword that first made kings divine , Heir to man 's grandest royalty — a Name ! Then didst thou burst upon the startled world , And keep the glorious promise of thy birth ; Then were the wings that bear the bolt unfurl 'd , A monarch 's voice cried , “ Place upon the Earth ! ” A new Philippi gain 'd a second Rome , And the Son 's sword avenged the greater Caesar 's doom . VII . But turn the eye to Life 's sequester 'd vale , And lowly roofs remote in hamlets green . Oft in my boyhood where the moss-grown pale Fenced quiet graves , a female form was seen ; Each eve she sought the melancholy ground , And lingering paused , and wistful look 'd around ; If yet some footstep rustled through the grass , Timorous she shrunk , and watch 'd the shadow pass . Then , when the spot lay lone amidst the gloom , Crept to one grave too humble for a tomb , There silent bow 'd her face above the dead , For , if in prayer , the prayer was inly said ; Still as the moonbeam , paused her quiet shade , Still as the moonbeam , through the yews to fade . Whose dust thus hallow 'd by so fond a care ? What the grave saith not — let the heart declare . On yonder green two orphan children play 'd ; By yonder rill two plighted lovers stray 'd . In yonder shrine two lives were blent in one , And joy-bells chimed beneath a summer sun . Poor was their lot — their bread in labour found ; No parent bless 'd them , and no kindred own 'd ; They smiled to hear the wise their choice condemn ; They loved — they loved — and love was wealth to them ! Hark — one short week — again the holy bell ! Still shone the sun , but dirge-like boom 'd the knell ; And when for that sweet world she knew before Look 'd forth the bride ,— she saw a grave the more . Full fifty years since then have pass 'd away , Her cheek is furrow 'd , and her hair is grey . Yet when she peaks of him ( the times are rare ) , Hear in her voice how youth still trembles there ! The very name of that young life that died , Still heaves the bosom , and recalls the bride . Lone o'er the widow 's hearth those years have fled , The daily toil still wins the daily bread ; No books deck sorrow with fantastic dyes : Her fond romance her woman heart supplies ; And , to the sabbath of still moments given , ( Day 's taskwork done ) — to memory , death , and heaven , There may — ( let poets answer me ! ) belong Thoughts of such pathos as had beggar 'd song . VIII . Yes , while thou hopest , music fills the air ; While thou rememberest , life reclothes the clod ; While thou canst feel the electric chain of prayer , Breathe but a thought , and be a soul with God ! Let not these forms of matter bound thine eye , He who the vanishing point of Human things Lifts from the landscape — lost amidst the sky , Has found the Ideal which the poet sings — Has pierced the pall around the senses thrown , And is himself a poet — though unknown . [ N ] Midsummer 's Night Dream . [ O ] According to a belief in the East , which is associated with one of the loveliest and most familiar of Oriental superstitions the bird of Paradise is never seen to rest upon the earth — and its nest is never to be found . [ P ] It is supposed by many of the commentators on Dante , that in the form of his lost Beatrice , who guides him in his Vision of Heaven , the poet allegorizes Religious Faith . [ Q ] The gloomy Typhon of Egypt assumes many of the mystic attributes of the Principle of Life which , in the Grecian Apotheosis of the Indian Bacchus , is represented in so genial a character of exuberant joy and everlasting youth . [ R ] “ What Plato thought , and godlike Cato was . ” — POPE . EPIGRAPH . “ COGITO — ERGO SUM . ” Self of myself , unto the future age Pass , murmuring low whate'er thine own has taught , “ I think , and therefore am , ” — exclaim 'd the Sage : As now the Man , so henceforth be the page ; A life , because a thought . Through various seas , exploring shores unknown , A soul went forth , and here bequeaths its chart — Here Doubt retains the question , Grief the groan , And here may Faith still shine , as when she shone And saved a sinking heart . From the lost nectar-streams of golden youth , From rivers loud with Babel 's madding throng , From wells whence Lore invokes reluctant Truth , And that blest pool the wings of angels smooth , Life fills mine urns of song . Calmly to time I leave these images Of things experienced , suffer 'd , felt , and seen ; Fruits shed or tempest-torn from changeful trees , Shells murmuring back the tides in distant seas — Signs where a Soul has been . As for the form Thought takes — the rudest hill Echoes denied to gardens back may give ; Life speaks in all the forms which Thought can fill ; If thought once born can perish not — here still I think , and therefore live !

These works abound in illustrations that teach benevolence to the rich , and courage to the poor ; they glow with the love of freedom ; they speak a sympathy with all high aspirations , and all manly struggle ; and where , in their more tragic portraitures , they depict the dread images of guilt and woe , they so clear our judgment by profound analysis , while they move our hearts by terror or compassion , that we learn to detect and stifle in ourselves the evil thought which we see gradually unfolding itself into the guilty deed . ” — Extract from Bulwer Lytton and his Works .
