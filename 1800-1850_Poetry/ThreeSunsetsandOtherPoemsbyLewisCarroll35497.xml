    <head>PREFACE .</head>
    <p n="1">Nearly the whole of this volume is a reprint of the serious portion of Phantasmagoria and other Poems , which was first published in 1869 and has long been out of print . “ The Path of Roses ” was written soon after the Crimean War , when the name of Florence Nightingale had already become a household-word . “ Only a Woman 's Hair ” was suggested by a circumstance mentioned in The Life of Dean Swift , viz ., that , after his death , a small packet was found among his papers , containing a single lock of hair and inscribed with those words . “ After Three Days ” was written after seeing Holman Hunt 's picture , The Finding of Christ in the Temple .</p>
    <p n="2">The two poems , “ Far Away ” and “ A Song of Love ” , are reprinted from Sylvie and Bruno and Sylvie and Bruno Concluded , books whose high price ( made necessary by the great cost of production ) has , I fear , put them out of the reach of most of my readers . “ A Lesson in Latin ” is reprinted from The Jabberwock , a Magazine got up among the Members of “ The Girls ’ Latin School , Boston , U. S. A . ” The only poems , here printed for the first time , are put together under the title of “ Puck Lost and Found , ” having been inscribed in two books — Fairies , a poem by Allingham , illustrated by Miss E. Gertrude Thomson , and Merry Elves , a story-book , by whom written I do not know , illustrated by C. O. Murray — which were presented to a little girl and boy , as a sort of memento of a visit paid by them to the author one day , on which occasion he taught them the pastime — dear to the hearts of children — of folding paper - “ pistols , ” which can be made to imitate , fairly well , the noise of a real one .</p>

     <l n="2">He saw her once , and in the glance ,</l>
     <l n="3">A moment 's glance of meeting eyes ,</l>
     <l n="4">His heart stood still in sudden trance :</l>
     <l n="5">He trembled with a sweet surprise —</l>
     <l n="6">All in the waning light she stood ,</l>
     <l n="7">The star of perfect womanhood .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="8">That summer-eve his heart was light :</l>
     <l n="9">With lighter step he trod the ground :</l>
     <l n="10">And life was fairer in his sight ,</l>
     <l n="11">And music was in every sound :</l>
     <l n="12">He blessed the world where there could be</l>
     <l n="13">So beautiful a thing as she .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="14">There once again , as evening fell</l>
     <l n="15">And stars were peering overhead ,</l>
     <l n="16">Two lovers met to bid farewell :</l>
     <l n="17">The western sun gleamed faint and red ,</l>
     <l n="18">Lost in a drift of purple cloud</l>
     <l n="19">That wrapped him like a funeral-shroud .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="20">Long time the memory of that night —</l>
     <l n="21">The hand that clasped , the lips that kissed ,</l>
     <l n="22">The form that faded from his sight</l>
     <l n="23">Slow sinking through the tearful mist —</l>
     <l n="24">In dreamy music seemed to roll</l>
     <l n="25">Through the dark chambers of his soul .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="26">So after many years he came</l>
     <l n="27">A wanderer from a distant shore :</l>
     <l n="28">The street , the house , were still the same ,</l>
     <l n="29">But those he sought were there no more :</l>
     <l n="30">His burning words , his hopes and fears ,</l>
     <l n="31">Unheeded fell on alien ears .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="32">Only the children from their play</l>
     <l n="33">Would pause the mournful tale to hear ,</l>
     <l n="34">Shrinking in half-alarm away ,</l>
     <l n="35">Or , step by step , would venture near</l>
     <l n="36">To touch with timid curious hands</l>
     <l n="37">That strange wild man from other lands .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="38">He sat beside the busy street ,</l>
     <l n="39">There , where he last had seen her face :</l>
     <l n="40">And thronging memories , bitter-sweet ,</l>
     <l n="41">Seemed yet to haunt the ancient place :</l>
     <l n="42">Her footfall ever floated near :</l>
     <l n="43">Her voice was ever in his ear .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="44">He sometimes , as the daylight waned</l>
     <l n="45">And evening mists began to roll ,</l>
     <l n="46">In half-soliloquy complained</l>
     <l n="47">Of that black shadow on his soul ,</l>
     <l n="48">And blindly fanned , with cruel care ,</l>
     <l n="49">The ashes of a vain despair .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="50">The summer fled : the lonely man</l>
     <l n="51">Still lingered out the lessening days ;</l>
     <l n="52">Still , as the night drew on , would scan</l>
     <l n="53">Each passing face with closer gaze —</l>
     <l n="54">Till , sick at heart , he turned away ,</l>
     <l n="55">And sighed “ she will not come to-day . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="56">So by degrees his spirit bent</l>
     <l n="57">To mock its own despairing cry ,</l>
     <l n="58">In stern self-torture to invent</l>
     <l n="59">New luxuries of agony ,</l>
     <l n="60">And people all the vacant space</l>
     <l n="61">With visions of her perfect face .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="62">Then for a moment she was nigh ,</l>
     <l n="63">He heard no step , but she was there ;</l>
     <l n="64">As if an angel suddenly</l>
     <l n="65">Were bodied from the viewless air ,</l>
     <l n="66">And all her fine ethereal frame</l>
     <l n="67">Should fade as swiftly as it came .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="68">So , half in fancy 's sunny trance ,</l>
     <l n="69">And half in misery 's aching void</l>
     <l n="70">With set and stony countenance</l>
     <l n="71">His bitter being he enjoyed ,</l>
     <l n="72">And thrust for ever from his mind</l>
     <l n="73">The happiness he could not find .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="74">As when the wretch , in lonely room ,</l>
     <l n="75">To selfish death is madly hurled ,</l>
     <l n="76">The glamour of that fatal fume</l>
     <l n="77">Shuts out the wholesome living world —</l>
     <l n="78">So all his manhood 's strength and pride</l>
     <l n="79">One sickly dream had swept aside .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="80">Yea , brother , and we passed him there ,</l>
     <l n="81">But yesterday , in merry mood ,</l>
     <l n="82">And marveled at the lordly air</l>
     <l n="83">That shamed his beggar 's attitude ,</l>
     <l n="84">Nor heeded that ourselves might be</l>
     <l n="85">Wretches as desperate as he ;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="86">Who let the thought of bliss denied</l>
     <l n="87">Make havoc of our life and powers ,</l>
     <l n="88">And pine , in solitary pride ,</l>
     <l n="89">For peace that never shall be ours ,</l>
     <l n="90">Because we will not work and wait</l>
     <l n="91">In trustful patience for our fate .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="92">And so it chanced once more that she</l>
     <l n="93">Came by the old familiar spot :</l>
     <l n="94">The face he would have died to see</l>
     <l n="95">Bent o'er him , and he knew it not ;</l>
     <l n="96">Too rapt in selfish grief to hear ,</l>
     <l n="97">Even when happiness was near .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="98">And pity filled her gentle breast</l>
     <l n="99">For him that would not stir nor speak</l>
     <l n="100">The dying crimson of the west ,</l>
     <l n="101">That faintly tinged his haggard cheek ,</l>
     <l n="102">Fell on her as she stood , and shed</l>
     <l n="103">A glory round the patient head .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="19">
     <l n="104">Ah , let him wake ! The moments fly :</l>
     <l n="105">This awful tryst may be the last .</l>
     <l n="106">And see , the tear , that dimmed her eye ,</l>
     <l n="107">Had fallen on him ere she passed —</l>
     <l n="108">She passed : the crimson paled to gray :</l>
     <l n="109">And hope departed with the day .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="20">
     <l n="110">The heavy hours of night went by ,</l>

     <l n="113">And life began its daily round —</l>
     <l n="114">But light and life for him were fled :</l>
     <l n="115">His name was numbered with the dead .</l>

    <head>THE PATH OF ROSES .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">In the dark silence of an ancient room ,</l>
     <l n="2">Whose one tall window fronted to the West ,</l>
     <l n="3">Where , through laced tendrils of a hanging vine ,</l>
     <l n="4">The sunset-glow was fading into night ,</l>
     <l n="5">Sat a pale Lady , resting weary hands</l>
     <l n="6">Upon a great clasped volume , and her face</l>
     <l n="7">Within her hands . Not as in rest she bowed ,</l>
     <l n="8">But large hot tears were coursing down her cheek ,</l>
     <l n="9">And her low-panted sobs broke awefully</l>
     <l n="10">Upon the sleeping echoes of the night .</l>
     <l n="11">Soon she unclasp 'd the volume once again ,</l>
     <l n="12">And read the words in tone of agony ,</l>
     <l n="13">As in self-torture , weeping as she read :—</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="14">“ He crowns the glory of his race :</l>
     <l n="15">He prayeth but in some fit place</l>
     <l n="16">To meet his foeman face to face :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="17">“ And , battling for the True , the Right ,</l>
     <l n="18">From ruddy dawn to purple night ,</l>
     <l n="19">To perish in the midmost fight :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="20">“ Where hearts are fierce and hands are strong ,</l>
     <l n="21">Where peals the bugle loud and long ,</l>
     <l n="22">Where blood is dropping in the throng :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="23">“ Still , with a dim and glazing eye ,</l>
     <l n="24">To watch the tide of victory ,</l>
     <l n="25">To hear in death the battle-cry :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="26">“ Then , gathered grandly to his grave ,</l>
     <l n="27">To rest among the true and brave ,</l>
     <l n="28">In holy ground , where yew-trees wave :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="29">“ Where , from church-windows sculptured fair ,</l>
     <l n="30">Float out upon the evening air</l>
     <l n="31">The note of praise , the voice of prayer :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="32">“ Where no vain marble mockery</l>
     <l n="33">Insults with loud and boastful lie</l>
     <l n="34">The simple soldier 's memory :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="35">“ Where sometimes little children go ,</l>
     <l n="36">And read , in whisper 'd accent slow ,</l>
     <l n="37">The name of him who sleeps below . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="38">Her voice died out : like one in dreams she sat .</l>
     <l n="39">“ Alas ! ” she sighed . “ For what can Woman do ?</l>
     <l n="40">Her life is aimless , and her death unknown :</l>
     <l n="41">Hemmed in by social forms she pines in vain .</l>
     <l n="42">Man has his work , but what can Woman do ? ”</l>
     <l n="43">And answer came there from the creeping gloom ,</l>
     <l n="44">The creeping gloom that settled into night :</l>
     <l n="45">“ Peace ! For thy lot is other than a man 's :</l>
     <l n="46">His is a path of thorns : he beats them down :</l>
     <l n="47">He faces death : he wrestles with despair .</l>
     <l n="48">Thine is of roses , to adorn and cheer</l>
     <l n="49">His lonely life , and hide the thorns in flowers . ”</l>
     <l n="50">She spake again : in bitter tone she spake :</l>
     <l n="51">“ Aye , as a toy , the puppet of an hour ,</l>
     <l n="52">Or a fair posy , newly plucked at morn ,</l>
     <l n="53">But flung aside and withered ere the night . ”</l>
     <l n="54">And answer came there from the creeping gloom ,</l>
     <l n="55">The creeping gloom that blackened into night :</l>
     <l n="56">“ So shalt thou be the lamp to light his path ,</l>
     <l n="57">What time the shades of sorrow close around . ”</l>
     <l n="58">And , so it seemed to her , an awful light</l>
     <l n="59">Pierced slowly through the darkness , orbed , and grew ,</l>
     <l n="60">Until all passed away — the ancient room —</l>
     <l n="61">The sunlight dying through the trellised vine —</l>
     <l n="62">The one tall window — all had passed away ,</l>
     <l n="63">And she was standing on the mighty hills .</l>
     <l n="64">Beneath , around , and far as eye could see ,</l>
     <l n="65">Squadron on squadron , stretched opposing hosts ,</l>
     <l n="66">Ranked as for battle , mute and motionless .</l>
     <l n="67">Anon a distant thunder shook the ground ,</l>
     <l n="68">The tramp of horses , and a troop shot by —</l>
     <l n="69">Plunged headlong in that living sea of men —</l>
     <l n="70">Plunged to their death : back from that fatal field</l>
     <l n="71">A scattered handful , fighting hard for life ,</l>
     <l n="72">Broke through the serried lines ; but , as she gazed ,</l>
     <l n="73">They shrank and melted , and their forms grew thin —</l>
     <l n="74">Grew pale as ghosts when the first morning ray</l>
     <l n="75">Dawns from the East — the trumpet 's brazen blare</l>
     <l n="76">Died into silence — and the vision passed —</l>
     <l n="77">Passed to a room where sick and dying lay</l>
     <l n="78">In long , sad line — there brooded Fear and Pain —</l>
     <l n="79">Darkness was there , the shade of Azrael 's wing .</l>
     <l n="80">But there was one that ever , to and fro ,</l>
     <l n="81">Moved with light footfall : purely calm her face ,</l>
     <l n="82">And those deep steadfast eyes that starred the gloom :</l>
     <l n="83">Still , as she went , she ministered to each</l>
     <l n="84">Comfort and counsel ; cooled the fevered brow</l>
     <l n="85">With softest touch , and in the listening ear</l>
     <l n="86">Of the pale sufferer whispered words of peace .</l>
     <l n="87">The dying warrior , gazing as she passed ,</l>
     <l n="88">Clasped his thin hands and blessed her . Bless her too ,</l>
     <l n="89">Thou , who didst bless the merciful of old !</l>

     <l n="91">Her gentle moving onward , till the night</l>
     <l n="92">Had veiled her wholly , and the vision passed .</l>
     <l n="93">Then once again the solemn whisper came :</l>
     <l n="94">“ So in the darkest path of man 's despair ,</l>
     <l n="95">Where War and Terror shake the troubled earth ,</l>
     <l n="96">Lies woman 's mission ; with unblenching brow</l>
     <l n="97">To pass through scenes of horror and affright</l>
     <l n="98">Where men grow sick and tremble : unto her</l>
     <l n="99">All things are sanctified , for all are good .</l>
     <l n="100">Nothing so mean , but shall deserve her care :</l>
     <l n="101">Nothing so great , but she may bear her part .</l>
     <l n="102">No life is vain : each hath his place assigned :</l>
     <l n="103">Do thou thy task , and leave the rest to God . ”</l>
     <l n="104">And there was silence , but the Lady made</l>
     <l n="105">No answer , save one deeply-breathed “ Amen . ”</l>
     <l n="106">And she arose , and in that darkening room</l>
     <l n="107">Stood lonely as a spirit of the night —</l>
     <l n="108">Stood calm and fearless in the gathered night —</l>
     <l n="109">And raised her eyes to heaven . There were tears</l>
     <l n="110">Upon her face , but in her heart was peace ,</l>
     <l n="111">Peace that the world nor gives nor takes away !</l>
