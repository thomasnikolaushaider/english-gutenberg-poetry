    <head>THE BAB BALLADS .</head>
    <head>THE YARN OF THE “ NANCY BELL . ”</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">‘ Twas on the shores that round our coast</l>
     <l n="2">From Deal to Ramsgate span ,</l>
     <l n="3">That I found alone , on a piece of stone ,</l>
     <l n="4">An elderly naval man .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">His hair was weedy , his beard was long ,</l>
     <l n="6">And weedy and long was he ,</l>
     <l n="7">And I heard this wight on the shore recite ,</l>
     <l n="8">In a singular minor key :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">“ Oh , I am a cook and a captain bold ,</l>
     <l n="10">And the mate of the Nancy brig ,</l>
     <l n="11">And a bo'sun tight , and a midshipmite ,</l>
     <l n="12">And the crew of the captain 's gig . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">And he shook his fists and he tore his hair .</l>
     <l n="14">Till I really felt afraid ;</l>
     <l n="15">For I could n't help thinking the man had been drinking ,</l>
     <l n="16">And so I simply said :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="17">“ Oh , elderly man it 's little I know</l>
     <l n="18">Of the duties of men of the sea ,</l>
     <l n="19">And I 'll eat my hand if I understand</l>
     <l n="20">How you can possibly be</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="21">“ At once a cook , and a captain bold ,</l>
     <l n="22">And the mate of the Nancy brig ,</l>
     <l n="23">And a bo'sun tight and a midshipmite ,</l>
     <l n="24">And the crew of the captain 's gig . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="25">Then he gave a hitch to his trousers , which</l>
     <l n="26">Is a trick all seamen larn ,</l>
     <l n="27">And having got rid of a thumping quid ,</l>
     <l n="28">He spun this painful yarn :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="29">“ ‘ Twas in the good ship Nancy Bell</l>
     <l n="30">That we sailed to the Indian sea ,</l>
     <l n="31">And there on a reef we come to grief ,</l>
     <l n="32">Which has often occurred to me .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="33">“ And pretty nigh all o ’ the crew was drowned</l>
     <l n="34">( There was seventy-seven o ’ soul ) ,</l>
     <l n="35">And only ten of the Nancy 's men</l>
     <l n="36">Said ‘ Here ! ’ to the muster roll .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="37">“ There was me and the cook and the captain bold ,</l>
     <l n="38">And the mate of the Nancy brig ,</l>
     <l n="39">And the bo'sun tight and a midshipmite ,</l>
     <l n="40">And the crew of the captain 's gig .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="41">“ For a month we 'd neither wittles nor drink ,</l>
     <l n="42">Till a-hungry we did feel ,</l>
     <l n="43">So , we drawed a lot , and , accordin ’ shot</l>
     <l n="44">The captain for our meal .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="45">“ The next lot fell to the Nancy 's mate ,</l>
     <l n="46">And a delicate dish he made ;</l>
     <l n="47">Then our appetite with the midshipmite</l>
     <l n="48">We seven survivors stayed .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="49">“ And then we murdered the bo'sun tight ,</l>
     <l n="50">And he much resembled pig ;</l>
     <l n="51">Then we wittled free , did the cook and me ,</l>
     <l n="52">On the crew of the captain 's gig .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="53">“ Then only the cook and me was left ,</l>
     <l n="54">And the delicate question , ‘ Which</l>
     <l n="55">Of us two goes to the kettle ? ’ arose ,</l>
     <l n="56">And we argued it out as sich .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="57">“ For I loved that cook as a brother , I did ,</l>
     <l n="58">And the cook he worshipped me ;</l>
     <l n="59">But we 'd both be blowed if we 'd either be stowed</l>
     <l n="60">In the other chap 's hold , you see .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="61">“ ‘ I 'll be eat if you dines off me , ’ says Tom ,</l>
     <l n="62">‘ Yes , that , ’ says I , ‘ you 'll be , ’ —</l>
     <l n="63">‘ I 'm boiled if I die , my friend , ’ quoth I ,</l>
     <l n="64">And ‘ Exactly so , ’ quoth he .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="65">“ Says he , ‘ Dear James , to murder me</l>
     <l n="66">Were a foolish thing to do ,</l>
     <l n="67">For do n't you see that you can n't cook me ,</l>
     <l n="68">While I can — and will — cook you ! ’</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="69">“ So , he boils the water , and takes the salt</l>
     <l n="70">And the pepper in portions true</l>
     <l n="71">( Which he never forgot ) , and some chopped shalot ,</l>
     <l n="72">And some sage and parsley too .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="19">
     <l n="73">“ ‘ Come here , ’ says he , with a proper pride ,</l>
     <l n="74">Which his smiling features tell ,</l>
     <l n="75">‘'T will soothing be if I let you see ,</l>
     <l n="76">How extremely nice you 'll smell , ’</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="20">
     <l n="77">“ And he stirred it round and round and round ,</l>
     <l n="78">And he sniffed the foaming froth ;</l>
     <l n="79">When I ups with his heels , and smothers his squeals</l>
     <l n="80">In the scum of the boiling broth .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="21">
     <l n="81">“ And I eat that cook in a week or less ,</l>
     <l n="82">And — as I eating be</l>
     <l n="83">The last of his chops , why I almost drops ,</l>
     <l n="84">For a wessel in sight I see .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="22">
     <l n="85">“ And I never larf , and I never smile ,</l>
     <l n="86">And I never lark nor play ,</l>
     <l n="87">But I sit and croak , and a single joke</l>
     <l n="88">I have — which is to say :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="23">
     <l n="89">“ Oh , I am a cook and a captain bold ,</l>
     <l n="90">And the mate of the Nancy brig ,</l>
     <l n="91">And a bo'sun tight , and a midshipmite ,</l>

    <head>KING GOODHEART .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">There lived a King , as I 've been told ,</l>
     <l n="2">In the wonder-working days of old ,</l>
     <l n="3">When hearts were twice as good as gold ,</l>
     <l n="4">And twenty times as mellow .</l>
     <l n="5">Good temper triumphed in his face ,</l>
     <l n="6">And in his heart he found a place</l>
     <l n="7">For all the erring human race</l>
     <l n="8">And every wretched fellow .</l>
     <l n="9">When he had Rhenish wine to drink</l>
     <l n="10">It made him very sad to think</l>
     <l n="11">That some , at junket or at jink ,</l>
     <l n="12">Must be content with toddy .</l>
     <l n="13">He wished all men as rich as he</l>
     <l n="14">( And he was rich as rich could be ) ,</l>

     <l n="20">And Dukes were three a penny .</l>
     <l n="21">Lord Chancellors were cheap as sprats .</l>
     <l n="22">And Bishops in their shovel hats</l>
     <l n="23">Were plentiful as tabby cats —</l>
     <l n="24">If possible , too many .</l>
     <l n="25">On every side Field-Marshals gleamed ,</l>
     <l n="26">Small beer were Lords Lieutenant deemed</l>
     <l n="27">With Admirals the ocean teemed</l>
     <l n="28">All round his wide dominions ;</l>
     <l n="29">And Party Leaders you might meet</l>

     <l n="35">Yet he 'd have acted otherwise</l>
     <l n="36">If he had been acuter .</l>
     <l n="37">The end is easily foretold ,</l>
     <l n="38">When every blessed thing you hold</l>
     <l n="39">Is made of silver , or of gold ,</l>
     <l n="40">You long for simple pewter .</l>
     <l n="41">When you have nothing else to wear</l>
     <l n="42">But cloth of gold and satins rare ,</l>
     <l n="43">For cloth of gold you cease to care —</l>
     <l n="44">Up goes the price of shoddy .</l>
     <l n="45">In short , whoever you may be ,</l>
     <l n="46">To this conclusion you 'll agree ,</l>
     <l n="47">When every one is somebodee ,</l>
