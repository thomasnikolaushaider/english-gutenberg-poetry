    <head>THE MAYOR OF SCUTTLETON .</head>
     <l n="1">THE Mayor of Scuttleton burned his nose</l>
     <l n="2">Trying to warm his copper toes ;</l>
     <l n="3">He lost his money and spoiled his will</l>
     <l n="4">By signing his name with an icicle-quill ;</l>
     <l n="5">He went bare-headed , and held his breath ,</l>
     <l n="6">And frightened his grandame most to death ;</l>
     <l n="7">He loaded a shovel , and tried to shoot ,</l>
     <l n="8">And killed the calf in the leg of his boot ;</l>
     <l n="9">He melted a snow-bird , and formed the habit</l>
     <l n="10">Of dancing jigs with a sad Welsh rabbit ;</l>
     <l n="11">He lived on taffy , and taxed the town ;</l>
     <l n="12">And read his newspaper upside down ;</l>
     <l n="13">Then he sighed , and hung his hat on a feather ,</l>
     <l n="14">And bade the townspeople come together ;</l>
     <l n="15">But the worst of it all was , nobody knew</l>
     <l n="16">What the Mayor of Scuttleton next would do .</l>

   <p>FIRE in the window ! flashes in the pane ! Fire on the roof-top ! blazing weather-vane ! Turn about , weather-vane ! put the fire out ! The sun 's going down , sir , I have n't a doubt .</p>

    <head>A STRANGER IN THE PEW .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">POOR little Bessie ! She tossed back her curls ,</l>
     <l n="2">And , though she is often the sweetest of girls ,</l>
     <l n="3">This was something she could n't and would n't endure ;</l>
     <l n="4">‘ Twas the meanest , most impolite act , she was sure ,</l>
     <l n="5">And a thing , she declared , that she never would do :</l>
     <l n="6">To go to a church where one did n't belong ,</l>
     <l n="7">Then walk down the aisle like the best in the throng ,</l>
     <l n="8">And seat one 's self plump in another one 's pew .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">Humph ! Did n't her father own his out and out ,</l>
     <l n="10">And did n't they fill it up full , just about ,</l>
     <l n="11">When Mamma and Papa , and herself and the boys ,</l>
     <l n="12">Were seated ? And did n't their boots make a noise</l>
     <l n="13">In moving along to make room for a stranger ?</l>
     <l n="14">And was n't it cool , with the brazenest face ,</l>
     <l n="15">To expect at each hymn Pa would find out the place</l>
     <l n="16">( If Ben did n't , or Bob , but there was n't much danger ) ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="17">With such feelings at heart , and their print on her face ,</l>
     <l n="18">Last Sunday our Bessie hitched out of her “ place ”</l>
     <l n="19">To make room for a girl , very shabby and thin ,</l>
     <l n="20">Who had stood in the aisle till mamma asked her in .</l>
     <l n="21">The poor little thing tried her best not to crowd</l>
     <l n="22">And Bessie , forgetting , soon had the mishap</l>
     <l n="23">To slip from her drowsiness into a nap ,</l>
     <l n="24">From which she soon wakened by crying aloud .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="25">Poor Bessie sat upright , with cheeks all a-flame</l>
     <l n="26">At sleeping in church , and trembled with shame ;</l>
     <l n="27">But ‘ twas strange at the close of the service to see</l>
     <l n="28">Our Bessie , now gentle as gentle could be ,</l>
     <l n="29">Take the hand of the shabby young girl in the pew ,</l>
     <l n="30">And walk with her out of the church with a smile</l>
     <l n="31">That shone through the tears in her eyes all the while ,</l>
     <l n="32">And brightened her face with a radiance new .</l>

     <l n="33">“ Good-by , ” whispered Bessie at parting , “ and mind</l>
     <l n="34">Our pew 's forty-five , with a pillar behind . ”</l>
     <l n="35">Then she stole to her mother : “ Oh , Mother , I dreamed</l>
     <l n="36">Such a curious dream ! ‘ Twas no wonder I screamed .</l>
     <l n="37">I thought I was sitting in church in this dress ,</l>
     <l n="38">With a girl like a beggar-girl right in our pew —</l>
     <l n="39">We were sitting alone on the seat , just we two —</l>
     <l n="40">And I felt more ashamed than you ever could guess ;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="41">“ When , all in a moment , the music grew loud ,</l>
     <l n="42">And on it came floating a beautiful crowd ;</l>
     <l n="43">They were angels , I knew , for they joined in the song ,</l>
     <l n="44">And all of them seemed in the church to belong .</l>
     <l n="45">Slowly and brightly they sailed through the air ;</l>
     <l n="46">The rays from the window streamed crimson and blue ,</l>
     <l n="47">And lit them in turn as their forms glided through ;—</l>
     <l n="48">I could feel their soft robes passing over my hair .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="49">“ One came to my side . Very sadly she said ,</l>
     <l n="50">‘ There 's a stranger in here . ’ I lifted my head ,</l>
     <l n="51">And looked at the poor shabby girl with disdain .</l>
     <l n="52">‘ Tis not she , ’ said the angel ; ‘ the haughty and vain</l>
     <l n="53">Are the strangers at church . She is humble and true . ’</l>
     <l n="54">Then I cried out aloud , and the minister spoke ,</l>
     <l n="55">And just as they floated away I awoke ,</l>
     <l n="56">And there sat that dear little girl in our pew ! ”</l>

   <p>Hans Brinker ; or , The Silver Skates is one of those stories which is destined to be a source of perennial delight to generation after generation of children . It tells of life in Holland — a country which changes so little that a story of people who lived there twenty years ago might be told of to-day as well , and it is marked throughout by a vivacity , a freshness , and a healthy vigor which goes straight to the heart of every reader whether he be old or young .</p>
   <p>From the Nation .</p>
   <p>“ The authoress has shown , in her former works for the young , a very rare ability to meet their wants ; but she has produced nothing better than this charming tale — alive with incident and action , adorned rather than freighted with useful facts , and moral without moralization . ”</p>
   <p>From the Atlantic Monthly .</p>
   <p>“ ‘ Hans Brinker ’ is a charming domestic story , which is addressed , indeed , to young people , but which may be read with pleasure and profit by their elders . * * The lessons inculcated , elevated in tone , are in the action of the story and the feelings and aspirations of the actors . ”</p>
   <p>From the Congregationalist .</p>
   <p>“ For children what could be better as a Christmas gift than a copy of Mrs . Dodge 's Hans Brinker ; or , the Silver Skates , of which we are now given a new and beautiful edition ? This is one of the most charming of juvenile stories , dealing with fresh scenes and a strange life , and told with sweet simplicity and great beauty . ”</p>
   <p>From the Watchman and Reflector .</p>
   <p>“ It has fine wit and natural pathos , and abounds in sentiments which are inspiring to the heart of any reader , young and old . * * * The character and incidents are of unusual interest . The plot is somewhat intricate , but is managed with a master 's skill . The tone is remarkably pure , and the lesson which the story itself presses home on the reader is in the highest degree significant . ”</p>
   <p>From the Cleveland Leader .</p>
   <p>“ Mrs . Dodge never permits her story to lag , and the bright eyes which have scanned its opening pages will not be content till they have followed the fascinating romance to its close . ”</p>
   <p>From Appleton 's Journal .</p>
   <p>“ A better present to a youngster of the right mind we should find it hard to select . ”</p>

    <head>The volumes already issued have insured the BRIC-A-BRAC SERIES wide and permanent popularity . New volumes quite as interesting and valuable as those already published will be issued at intervals . It is the aim to gather up in this collection , from the numerous biographies , autobiographies , and memoirs that have lately appeared , all the reminiscences worth preservation of the men and women who have done so much to make this century one of the most brilliant in the annals of English Literature . Occasionally , too , place will be found in the volumes for some of the more notable papers regarding distinguished men and women , which form so important a part of the magazine literature of the day . Each volume will be complete in itself . A careful index will furnish a ready guide to the contents of the different volumes , in which , under the capable editorship of MR. R. H. STODDARD , it may safely be asserted there will be brought together a fund of choice and fresh anecdote and gossip , enough not only to justify the general title of the Series , but the line of Marlowe which has been selected as its motto , “ Infinite riches in a little room . ”</head>
