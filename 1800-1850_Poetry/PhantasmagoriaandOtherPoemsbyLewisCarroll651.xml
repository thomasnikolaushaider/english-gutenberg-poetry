   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">One winter night , at half-past nine ,</l>
     <l n="2">Cold , tired , and cross , and muddy ,</l>
     <l n="3">I had come home , too late to dine ,</l>
     <l n="4">And supper , with cigars and wine ,</l>
     <l n="5">Was waiting in the study .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="6">There was a strangeness in the room ,</l>
     <l n="7">And Something white and wavy</l>
     <l n="8">Was standing near me in the gloom -</l>
     <l n="9">I took it for the carpet-broom</l>
     <l n="10">Left by that careless slavey .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="11">But presently the Thing began</l>
     <l n="12">To shiver and to sneeze :</l>
     <l n="13">On which I said “ Come , come , my man !</l>
     <l n="14">That 's a most inconsiderate plan .</l>
     <l n="15">Less noise there , if you please ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="16">“ I 've caught a cold , ” the Thing replies ,</l>
     <l n="17">“ Out there upon the landing . ”</l>
     <l n="18">I turned to look in some surprise ,</l>
     <l n="19">And there , before my very eyes ,</l>
     <l n="20">A little Ghost was standing !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="21">He trembled when he caught my eye ,</l>
     <l n="22">And got behind a chair .</l>
     <l n="23">“ How came you here , ” I said , “ and why ?</l>
     <l n="24">I never saw a thing so shy .</l>
     <l n="25">Come out ! Do n't shiver there ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="26">He said “ I 'd gladly tell you how ,</l>
     <l n="27">And also tell you why ;</l>
     <l n="28">But ” ( here he gave a little bow )</l>
     <l n="29">“ You 're in so bad a temper now ,</l>
     <l n="30">You 'd think it all a lie .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="31">“ And as to being in a fright ,</l>
     <l n="32">Allow me to remark</l>
     <l n="33">That Ghosts have just as good a right</l>
     <l n="34">In every way , to fear the light ,</l>
     <l n="35">As Men to fear the dark . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="36">“ No plea , ” said I , “ can well excuse</l>
     <l n="37">Such cowardice in you :</l>
     <l n="38">For Ghosts can visit when they choose ,</l>
     <l n="39">Whereas we Humans ca'n ' t refuse</l>
     <l n="40">To grant the interview . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="41">He said “ A flutter of alarm</l>
     <l n="42">Is not unnatural , is it ?</l>
     <l n="43">I really feared you meant some harm :</l>
     <l n="44">But , now I see that you are calm ,</l>
     <l n="45">Let me explain my visit .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="46">“ Houses are classed , I beg to state ,</l>
     <l n="47">According to the number</l>
     <l n="48">Of Ghosts that they accommodate :</l>
     <l n="49">( The Tenant merely counts as WEIGHT ,</l>
     <l n="50">With Coals and other lumber ) .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="51">“ This is a ‘ one-ghost ’ house , and you</l>
     <l n="52">When you arrived last summer ,</l>
     <l n="53">May have remarked a Spectre who</l>
     <l n="54">Was doing all that Ghosts can do</l>
     <l n="55">To welcome the new-comer .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="56">“ In Villas this is always done -</l>
     <l n="57">However cheaply rented :</l>
     <l n="58">For , though of course there 's less of fun</l>
     <l n="59">When there is only room for one ,</l>
     <l n="60">Ghosts have to be contented .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="61">“ That Spectre left you on the Third -</l>
     <l n="62">Since then you 've not been haunted :</l>
     <l n="63">For , as he never sent us word ,</l>
     <l n="64">‘ Twas quite by accident we heard</l>
     <l n="65">That any one was wanted .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="66">“ A Spectre has first choice , by right ,</l>
     <l n="67">In filling up a vacancy ;</l>
     <l n="68">Then Phantom , Goblin , Elf , and Sprite -</l>
     <l n="69">If all these fail them , they invite</l>
     <l n="70">The nicest Ghoul that they can see .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="71">“ The Spectres said the place was low ,</l>
     <l n="72">And that you kept bad wine :</l>
     <l n="73">So , as a Phantom had to go ,</l>
     <l n="74">And I was first , of course , you know ,</l>
     <l n="75">I could n't well decline . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="76">“ No doubt , ” said I , “ they settled who</l>
     <l n="77">Was fittest to be sent</l>
     <l n="78">Yet still to choose a brat like you ,</l>
     <l n="79">To haunt a man of forty-two ,</l>
     <l n="80">Was no great compliment ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="81">“ I 'm not so young , Sir , ” he replied ,</l>
     <l n="82">“ As you might think . The fact is ,</l>
     <l n="83">In caverns by the water-side ,</l>
     <l n="84">And other places that I 've tried ,</l>
     <l n="85">I 've had a lot of practice :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="86">“ But I have never taken yet</l>
     <l n="87">A strict domestic part ,</l>
     <l n="88">And in my flurry I forget</l>
     <l n="89">The Five Good Rules of Etiquette</l>
     <l n="90">We have to know by heart . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="19">
     <l n="91">My sympathies were warming fast</l>
     <l n="92">Towards the little fellow :</l>
     <l n="93">He was so utterly aghast</l>
     <l n="94">At having found a Man at last ,</l>
     <l n="95">And looked so scared and yellow .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="20">
     <l n="96">“ At least , ” I said , “ I 'm glad to find</l>
     <l n="97">A Ghost is not a DUMB thing !</l>
     <l n="98">But pray sit down : you 'll feel inclined</l>
     <l n="99">( If , like myself , you have not dined )</l>
     <l n="100">To take a snack of something :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="21">
     <l n="101">“ Though , certainly , you do n't appear</l>
     <l n="102">A thing to offer FOOD to !</l>
     <l n="103">And then I shall be glad to hear -</l>
     <l n="104">If you will say them loud and clear -</l>
     <l n="105">The Rules that you allude to . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="22">
     <l n="106">“ Thanks ! You shall hear them by and by .</l>
     <l n="107">This IS a piece of luck ! ”</l>
     <l n="108">“ What may I offer you ? ” said I .</l>
     <l n="109">“ Well , since you ARE so kind , I 'll try</l>
     <l n="110">A little bit of duck .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="23">
     <l n="111">“ ONE slice ! And may I ask you for</l>
     <l n="112">Another drop of gravy ? ”</l>
     <l n="113">I sat and looked at him in awe ,</l>
     <l n="114">For certainly I never saw</l>
     <l n="115">A thing so white and wavy .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="24">
     <l n="116">And still he seemed to grow more white ,</l>
     <l n="117">More vapoury , and wavier -</l>
     <l n="118">Seen in the dim and flickering light ,</l>
     <l n="119">As he proceeded to recite</l>
     <l n="120">His “ Maxims of Behaviour . ”</l>
    </lg>

     <l n="121">CANTO II — Hys Fyve Rules</l>

     <l n="122">“ My First — but do n't suppose , ” he said ,</l>
     <l n="123">“ I 'm setting you a riddle -</l>
     <l n="124">Is — if your Victim be in bed ,</l>
     <l n="125">Do n't touch the curtains at his head ,</l>
     <l n="126">But take them in the middle ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="27">
     <l n="127">“ And wave them slowly in and out ,</l>
     <l n="128">While drawing them asunder ;</l>
     <l n="129">And in a minute 's time , no doubt ,</l>

     <l n="132">“ And here you must on no pretence</l>
     <l n="133">Make the first observation .</l>
     <l n="134">Wait for the Victim to commence :</l>
     <l n="135">No Ghost of any common sense</l>
     <l n="136">Begins a conversation .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>“ If he should say ‘ HOW CAME YOU HERE ? ’ ( The way that YOU began , Sir ,) In such a case your course is clear -  ‘ ON THE BAT 'S BACK , MY LITTLE DEAR ! ’ Is the appropriate answer .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ If after this he says no more ,</l>
     <l n="2">You 'd best perhaps curtail your</l>
     <l n="3">Exertions — go and shake the door ,</l>
     <l n="4">And then , if he begins to snore ,</l>
     <l n="5">You 'll know the thing 's a failure .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="6">“ By day , if he should be alone -</l>
     <l n="7">At home or on a walk -</l>
     <l n="8">You merely give a hollow groan ,</l>
     <l n="9">To indicate the kind of tone</l>
     <l n="10">In which you mean to talk .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="11">“ But if you find him with his friends ,</l>
     <l n="12">The thing is rather harder .</l>
     <l n="13">In such a case success depends</l>
     <l n="14">On picking up some candle-ends ,</l>
     <l n="15">Or butter , in the larder .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="16">“ With this you make a kind of slide</l>

     <l n="19">And swing yourself from side to side -</l>
     <l n="20">One soon learns how to do it .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>“ The Second tells us what is right In ceremonious calls : -  ‘ FIRST BURN A BLUE OR CRIMSON LIGHT ’ ( A thing I quite forgot to-night ) , ‘ THEN SCRATCH THE DOOR OR WALLS . ’ ”</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">I said “ You 'll visit HERE no more ,</l>

     <l n="5">I 'd like to see you try ! ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>“ The Third was written to protect The interests of the Victim , And tells us , as I recollect , TO TREAT HIM WITH A GRAVE RESPECT , AND NOT TO CONTRADICT HIM . ”</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ That 's plain , ” said I , “ as Tare and Tret ,</l>

     <l n="3">I only wish SOME Ghosts I 've met</l>
     <l n="4">Would not so CONSTANTLY forget</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="6">“ Perhaps , ” he said , “ YOU first transgressed</l>
     <l n="7">The laws of hospitality :</l>

     <l n="16">“ The Fourth prohibits trespassing</l>

     <l n="19">( Unless when pardoned by the King )</l>

   <p>“ The Fifth is one you may prefer That I should quote entire : -  THE KING MUST BE ADDRESSED AS ‘ SIR . ’ THIS , FROM A SIMPLE COURTIER , IS ALL THE LAWS REQUIRE :</p>

    <head>HIAWATHA 'S PHOTOGRAPHING</head>
    <note>In an age of imitation , I can claim no special merit for this slight attempt at doing what is known to be so easy . Any fairly practised writer , with the slightest ear for rhythm , could compose , for hours together , in the easy running metre of ‘ The Song of Hiawatha . ’ Having , then , distinctly stated that I challenge no attention in the following little poem to its merely verbal jingle , I must beg the candid reader to confine his criticism to its treatment of the subject .</note>

     <l n="136">What he 'd be before he 'd stand it .</l>
     <l n="137">Hurriedly he packed his boxes :</l>
     <l n="138">Hurriedly the porter trundled</l>

   <p>TEMA CON VARIAZIONI</p>
   <p>[ Why is it that Poetry has never yet been subjected to that process of Dilution which has proved so advantageous to her sister-art Music ? The Diluter gives us first a few notes of some well-known Air , then a dozen bars of his own , then a few more notes of the Air , and so on alternately : thus saving the listener , if not from all risk of recognising the melody at all , at least from the too - exciting transports which it might produce in a more concentrated form . The process is termed “ setting ” by Composers , and any one , that has ever experienced the emotion of being unexpectedly set down in a heap of mortar , will recognise the truthfulness of this happy phrase .</p>
   <p>For truly , just as the genuine Epicure lingers lovingly over a morsel of supreme Venison — whose every fibre seems to murmur “ Excelsior ! ” — yet swallows , ere returning to the toothsome dainty , great mouthfuls of oatmeal-porridge and winkles : and just as the perfect Connoisseur in Claret permits himself but one delicate sip , and then tosses off a pint or more of boarding-school beer : so also -</p>
   <p>I never loved a dear Gazelle -  NOR ANYTHING THAT COST ME MUCH : HIGH PRICES PROFIT THOSE WHO SELL , BUT WHY SHOULD I BE FOND OF SUCH ?</p>
   <p>To glad me with his soft black eye MY SON COMES TROTTING HOME FROM SCHOOL ; HE 'S HAD A FIGHT BUT CAN'T TELL WHY -  HE ALWAYS WAS A LITTLE FOOL !</p>
   <p>But , when he came to know me well , HE KICKED ME OUT , HER TESTY SIRE : AND WHEN I STAINED MY HAIR , THAT BELLE MIGHT NOTE THE CHANGE , AND THUS ADMIRE</p>
   <p>And love me , it was sure to dye A MUDDY GREEN OR STARING BLUE : WHILST ONE MIGHT TRACE , WITH HALF AN EYE , THE STILL TRIUMPHANT CARROT THROUGH .</p>
