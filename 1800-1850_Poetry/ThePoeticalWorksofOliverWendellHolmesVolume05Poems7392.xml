     <l n="10">As Tam O'Shanter ' s luckless mare ;</l>
     <l n="11">To-day , old friend , remember still</l>

     <l n="16">In big brave letters , fair to see ,—</l>

     <l n="22">You 've made the dead past live again</l>
     <l n="23">The world may call you what it will ,</l>
     <l n="24">But you and I are Joe and Bill .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="25">The chaffing young folks stare and say</l>

     <l n="31">How Bill forgets his hour of pride ,</l>

     <l n="34">Finds the old schoolmate in his eyes ,—</l>
     <l n="35">Those calm , stern eyes that melt and fill</l>
     <l n="36">As Joe looks fondly up at Bill .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="37">Ah , pensive scholar , what is fame ?</l>
     <l n="38">A fitful tongue of leaping flame ;</l>
     <l n="39">A giddy whirlwind 's fickle gust ,</l>
     <l n="40">That lifts a pinch of mortal dust ;</l>
     <l n="41">A few swift years , and who can show</l>
     <l n="42">Which dust was Bill and which was Joe ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="43">The weary idol takes his stand ,</l>
     <l n="44">Holds out his bruised and aching hand ,</l>

     <l n="46">How vain it seems , this empty show !</l>
     <l n="47">Till all at once his pulses thrill ;—</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="49">And shall we breathe in happier spheres</l>
     <l n="50">The names that pleased our mortal ears ;</l>
     <l n="51">In some sweet lull of harp and song</l>
     <l n="52">For earth-born spirits none too long ,</l>
     <l n="53">Just whispering of the world below</l>
     <l n="54">Where this was Bill and that was Joe ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="55">No matter ; while our home is here</l>
     <l n="56">No sounding name is half so dear ;</l>
     <l n="57">When fades at length our lingering day ,</l>
     <l n="58">Who cares what pompous tombstones say ?</l>
     <l n="59">Read on the hearts that love us still ,</l>
     <l n="60">Hic jacet Joe . Hic jacet Bill .</l>

     <l n="2">IT is a pity and a shame — alas ! alas ! I know it is ,</l>
     <l n="3">To tread the trodden grapes again , but so it has been ,</l>
     <l n="4">so it is ;</l>
     <l n="5">The purple vintage long is past , with ripened</l>
     <l n="6">clusters bursting so</l>
     <l n="7">They filled the wine-vats to the brim , -  ‘ t is strange</l>
     <l n="8">you will be thirsting so !</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Too well our faithful memory tells what might be rhymed or sung about , For all have sighed and some have wept since last year 's snows were flung about ; The beacon flame that fired the sky , the modest ray that gladdened us , A little breath has quenched their light , and deepening shades have saddened us .</p>
   <p>No more our brother 's life is ours for cheering or for grieving us , One only sadness they bequeathed , the sorrow of their leaving us ; Farewell ! Farewell !— I turn the leaf I read my chiming measure in ; Who knows but something still is there a friend may find a pleasure in ? For who can tell by what he likes what other people 's fancies are ? How all men think the best of wives their own particular Nancies are ? If what I sing you brings a smile , you will not stop to catechise , Nor read Bceotia 's lumbering line with nicely scanning Attic eyes .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Perhaps the alabaster box that Mary broke so</l>
     <l n="2">lovingly ,</l>
     <l n="3">While Judas looked so sternly on , the Master so</l>
     <l n="4">approvingly ,</l>
     <l n="5">Was not so fairly wrought as those that Pilate 's</l>
     <l n="6">wife and daughters had ,</l>
     <l n="7">Or many a dame of Judah 's line that drank of</l>
     <l n="8">Jordan 's waters had .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Perhaps the balm that cost so dear , as some remarked officiously , The precious nard that filled the room with fragrance so deliciously , So oft recalled in storied page and sung in verse melodious , The dancing girl had thought too cheap ,— that daughter of Herodias .</p>
   <p>Where now are all the mighty deeds that Herod boasted loudest of ? Where now the flashing jewelry the tetrarch 's wife was proudest of ? Yet still to hear how Mary loved , all tribes of men are listening , And still the sinful woman 's tears like stars heaven are glistening .</p>
   <p>‘ T is not the gift our hands have brought , the love it is we bring with it ,— The minstrel 's lips may shape the song , his heart in tune must sing with it ; And so we love the simple lays , and wish we might have more of them , Our poet brothers sing for us ,— there must be half a score of them .</p>
   <p>It may be that of fame and name our voices once were emulous ,— With deeper thoughts , with tenderer throbs their softening tones are tremulous ; The dead seem listening as of old , ere friendship was bereft of them ; The living wear a kinder smile , the remnant that is left of them .</p>
   <p>Though on the once unfurrowed brows the harrow - teeth of Time may show , Though all the strain of crippling years the halting feet of rhyme may show , We look and hear with melting hearts , for what we all remember is The morn of Spring , nor heed how chill the sky of gray November is .</p>
   <p>Thanks to the gracious powers above from all mankind that singled us , And dropped the pearl of friendship in the cup they kindly mingled us , And bound us in a wreath of flowers with hoops of steel knit under it ;— Nor time , nor space , nor chance , nor change , nor death himself shall sunder it !</p>

     <l n="12">Time is the angel-thief that Nature sends us</l>
     <l n="13">To break the cramping fetters of our past .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="14">Mourn as we may for treasures he has taken ,</l>
     <l n="15">Poor as we feel of hoarded wealth bereft ,</l>
     <l n="16">More precious are those implements forsaken ,</l>
     <l n="17">Found in the wreck his ruthless hands have left .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="18">Some lever that a casket 's hinge has broken</l>
     <l n="19">Pries off a bolt , and lo ! our souls are free ;</l>
     <l n="20">Each year some Open Sesame is spoken ,</l>
     <l n="21">And every decade drops its master-key .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="22">So as from year to year we count our treasure ,</l>
     <l n="23">Our loss seems less , and larger look our gains ;</l>
     <l n="24">Time 's wrongs repaid in more than even measure ,—</l>
     <l n="25">We lose our jewels , but we break our chains .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="2">THE Play is over . While the light</l>
     <l n="3">Yet lingers in the darkening hall ,</l>
     <l n="4">I come to say a last Good-night</l>
     <l n="5">Before the final Exeunt all .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="6">We gathered once , a joyous throng :</l>
     <l n="7">The jovial toasts went gayly round ;</l>
     <l n="8">With jest , and laugh , and shout , and song ,</l>
     <l n="9">We made the floors and walls resound .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="10">We come with feeble steps and slow ,</l>
     <l n="11">A little band of four or five ,</l>
     <l n="12">Left from the wrecks of long ago ,</l>
     <l n="13">Still pleased to find ourselves alive .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="14">Alive ! How living , too , are they</l>
     <l n="15">Whose memories it is ours to share !</l>
     <l n="16">Spread the long table 's full array ,—</l>
     <l n="17">There sits a ghost in every chair !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="18">One breathing form no more , alas !</l>
     <l n="19">Amid our slender group we see ;</l>
     <l n="20">With him we still remained “ The Class , ” —</l>
     <l n="21">Without his presence what are we ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="22">The hand we ever loved to clasp ,—</l>
     <l n="23">That tireless hand which knew no rest ,—</l>
     <l n="24">Loosed from affection 's clinging grasp ,</l>
     <l n="25">Lies nerveless on the peaceful breast .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="26">The beaming eye , the cheering voice ,</l>
     <l n="27">That lent to life a generous glow ,</l>
     <l n="28">Whose every meaning said “ Rejoice , ”</l>
     <l n="29">We see , we hear , no more below .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="30">The air seems darkened by his loss ,</l>
     <l n="31">Earth 's shadowed features look less fair ,</l>
     <l n="32">And heavier weighs the daily cross</l>
     <l n="33">His willing shoulders helped us bear .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="34">Why mourn that we , the favored few</l>
     <l n="35">Whom grasping Time so long has spared</l>
     <l n="36">Life 's sweet illusions to pursue ,</l>
     <l n="37">The common lot of age have shared ?</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="38">In every pulse of Friendship 's heart</l>
     <l n="39">There breeds unfelt a throb of pain ,—</l>
     <l n="40">One hour must rend its links apart ,</l>
     <l n="41">Though years on years have forged the chain .</l>

     <l n="43">So ends “ The Boys , ” — a lifelong play .</l>
