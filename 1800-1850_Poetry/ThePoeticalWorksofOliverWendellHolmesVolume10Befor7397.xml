   <p>AT THE SATURDAY CLUB THIS is our place of meeting ; opposite That towered and pillared building : look at it ; King 's Chapel in the Second George 's day , Rebellion stole its regal name away ,— Stone Chapel sounded better ; but at last The poisoned name of our provincial past Had lost its ancient venom ; then once more Stone Chapel was King 's Chapel as before . ( So let rechristened North Street , when it can , Bring back the days of Marlborough and Queen Anne ! ) Next the old church your wandering eye will meet — A granite pile that stares upon the street — Our civic temple ; slanderous tongues have said Its shape was modelled from St. Botolph 's head , Lofty , but narrow ; jealous passers-by Say Boston always held her head too high . Turn half-way round , and let your look survey The white facade that gleams across the way ,— The many-windowed building , tall and wide , The palace-inn that shows its northern side In grateful shadow when the sunbeams beat The granite wall in summer 's scorching heat . This is the place ; whether its name you spell Tavern , or caravansera , or hotel . Would I could steal its echoes ! you should find Such store of vanished pleasures brought to mind Such feasts ! the laughs of many a jocund hour That shook the mortar from King George 's tower ; Such guests ! What famous names its record boasts , Whose owners wander in the mob of ghosts ! Such stories ! Every beam and plank is filled With juicy wit the joyous talkers spilled , Ready to ooze , as once the mountain pine The floors are laid with oozed its turpentine !</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">A month had flitted since The Club had met ;</l>
     <l n="2">The day came round ; I found the table set ,</l>
     <l n="3">The waiters lounging round the marble stairs ,</l>
     <l n="4">Empty as yet the double row of chairs .</l>
     <l n="5">I was a full half hour before the rest ,</l>
     <l n="6">Alone , the banquet-chamber 's single guest .</l>
     <l n="7">So from the table 's side a chair I took ,</l>
     <l n="8">And having neither company nor book</l>
     <l n="9">To keep me waking , by degrees there crept</l>
     <l n="10">A torpor over me ,— in short , I slept .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="11">Loosed from its chain , along the wreck-strown track</l>
     <l n="12">Of the dead years my soul goes travelling back ;</l>
     <l n="13">My ghosts take on their robes of flesh ; it seems</l>
     <l n="14">Dreaming is life ; nay , life less life than dreams ,</l>
     <l n="15">So real are the shapes that meet my eyes .</l>
     <l n="16">They bring no sense of wonder , no surprise ,</l>
     <l n="17">No hint of other than an earth-born source ;</l>
     <l n="18">All seems plain daylight , everything of course .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="19">How dim the colors are , how poor and faint</l>
     <l n="20">This palette of weak words with which I paint !</l>
     <l n="21">Here sit my friends ; if I could fix them so</l>
     <l n="22">As to my eyes they seem , my page would glow</l>
     <l n="23">Like a queen 's missal , warm as if the brush</l>
     <l n="24">Of Titian or Velasquez brought the flush</l>
     <l n="25">Of life into their features . Ay de mi !</l>
     <l n="26">If syllables were pigments , you should see</l>
     <l n="27">Such breathing portraitures as never man</l>
     <l n="28">Found in the Pitti or the Vatican .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="29">Here sits our POET , Laureate , if you will .</l>
     <l n="30">Long has he worn the wreath , and wears it still .</l>
     <l n="31">Dead ? Nay , not so ; and yet they say his bust</l>
     <l n="32">Looks down on marbles covering royal dust ,</l>
     <l n="33">Kings by the Grace of God , or Nature 's grace ;</l>
     <l n="34">Dead ! No ! Alive ! I see him in his place ,</l>
     <l n="35">Full-featured , with the bloom that heaven denies</l>
     <l n="36">Her children , pinched by cold New England skies ,</l>
     <l n="37">Too often , while the nursery 's happier few</l>
     <l n="38">Win from a summer cloud its roseate hue .</l>
     <l n="39">Kind , soft-voiced , gentle , in his eye there shines</l>
     <l n="40">The ray serene that filled Evangeline 's .</l>
     <l n="41">Modest he seems , not shy ; content to wait</l>
     <l n="42">Amid the noisy clamor of debate</l>
     <l n="43">The looked-for moment when a peaceful word</l>
     <l n="44">Smooths the rough ripples louder tongues have stirred .</l>
     <l n="45">In every tone I mark his tender grace</l>
     <l n="46">And all his poems hinted in his face ;</l>
     <l n="47">What tranquil joy his friendly presence gives !</l>
     <l n="48">How could . I think him dead ? He lives ! He lives !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="49">There , at the table 's further end I see</l>
     <l n="50">In his old place our Poet 's vis-a-vis ,</l>
     <l n="51">The great PROFESSOR , strong , broad-shouldered , square ,</l>
     <l n="52">In life 's rich noontide , joyous , debonair .</l>
     <l n="53">His social hour no leaden care alloys ,</l>
     <l n="54">His laugh rings loud and mirthful as a boy 's ,—</l>
     <l n="55">That lusty laugh the Puritan forgot ,—</l>
     <l n="56">What ear has heard it and remembers not ?</l>
     <l n="57">How often , halting at some wide crevasse</l>
     <l n="58">Amid the windings of his Alpine pass ,</l>
     <l n="59">High up the cliffs , the climbing mountaineer ,</l>
     <l n="60">Listening the far-off avalanche to hear ,</l>
     <l n="61">Silent , and leaning on his steel-shod staff ,</l>
     <l n="62">Has heard that cheery voice , that ringing laugh ,</l>
     <l n="63">From the rude cabin whose nomadic walls</l>
     <l n="64">Creep with the moving glacier as it crawls</l>
     <l n="65">How does vast Nature lead her living train</l>
     <l n="66">In ordered sequence through that spacious brain ,</l>
     <l n="67">As in the primal hour when Adam named</l>
     <l n="68">The new-born tribes that young creation claimed !—</l>
     <l n="69">How will her realm be darkened , losing thee ,</l>
     <l n="70">Her darling , whom we call our AGASSIZ !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="71">But who is he whose massive frame belies</l>
     <l n="72">The maiden shyness of his downcast eyes ?</l>
     <l n="73">Who broods in silence till , by questions pressed ,</l>
     <l n="74">Some answer struggles from his laboring breast ?</l>
     <l n="75">An artist Nature meant to dwell apart ,</l>
     <l n="76">Locked in his studio with a human heart ,</l>
     <l n="77">Tracking its eaverned passions to their lair ,</l>
     <l n="78">And all its throbbing mysteries laying bare .</l>
     <l n="79">Count it no marvel that he broods alone</l>
     <l n="80">Over the heart he studies ,— ‘ t is his own ;</l>
     <l n="81">So in his page , whatever shape it wear ,</l>
     <l n="82">The Essex wizard 's shadowed self is there ,—</l>
     <l n="83">The great ROMANCER , hid beneath his veil</l>
     <l n="84">Like the stern preacher of his sombre tale ;</l>
     <l n="85">Virile in strength , yet bashful as a girl ,</l>
     <l n="86">Prouder than Hester , sensitive as Pearl .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="87">From his mild throng of worshippers released ,</l>
     <l n="88">Our Concord Delphi sends its chosen priest ,</l>
     <l n="89">Prophet or poet , mystic , sage , or seer ,</l>
     <l n="90">By every title always welcome here .</l>
     <l n="91">Why that ethereal spirit 's frame describe ?</l>
     <l n="92">You know the race-marks of the Brahmin tribe ,</l>
     <l n="93">The spare , slight form , the sloping shoulders ’ droop ,</l>
     <l n="94">The calm , scholastic mien , the clerkly stoop ,</l>
     <l n="95">The lines of thought the sharpened features wear ,</l>
     <l n="96">Carved by the edge of keen New England air .</l>
     <l n="97">List ! for he speaks ! As when a king would choose</l>
     <l n="98">The jewels for his bride , he might refuse</l>
     <l n="99">This diamond for its flaw ,— find that less bright</l>
     <l n="100">Than those , its fellows , and a pearl less white</l>
     <l n="101">Than fits her snowy neck , and yet at last ,</l>
     <l n="102">The fairest gems are chosen , and made fast</l>
     <l n="103">In golden fetters ; so , with light delays</l>
     <l n="104">He seeks the fittest word to fill his phrase ;</l>
     <l n="105">Nor vain nor idle his fastidious quest ,</l>
     <l n="106">His chosen word is sure to prove the best .</l>
     <l n="107">Where in the realm of thought , whose air is song ,</l>
     <l n="108">Does he , the Buddha of the West , belong ?</l>
     <l n="109">He seems a winged Franklin , sweetly wise ,</l>
     <l n="110">Born to unlock the secrets of the skies ;</l>
     <l n="111">And which the nobler calling ,— if ‘ t is fair</l>
     <l n="112">Terrestrial with celestial to compare ,—</l>
     <l n="113">To guide the storm-cloud 's elemental flame ,</l>
     <l n="114">Or walk the chambers whence the lightning came ,</l>
     <l n="115">Amidst the sources of its subtile fire ,</l>
     <l n="116">And steal their effluence for his lips and lyre ?</l>
     <l n="117">If lost at times in vague aerial flights ,</l>
     <l n="118">None treads with firmer footstep when he lights ;</l>
     <l n="119">A soaring nature , ballasted with sense ,</l>
     <l n="120">Wisdom without her wrinkles or pretence ,</l>
     <l n="121">In every Bible he has faith to read ,</l>
     <l n="122">And every altar helps to shape his creed .</l>
     <l n="123">Ask you what name this prisoned spirit bears</l>
     <l n="124">While with ourselves this fleeting breath it shares ?</l>
     <l n="125">Till angels greet him with a sweeter one</l>
     <l n="126">In heaven , on earth we call him EMERSON .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="127">I start ; I wake ; the vision is withdrawn ;</l>
     <l n="128">Its figures fading like the stars at dawn ;</l>
     <l n="129">Crossed from the roll of life their cherished names ,</l>
     <l n="130">And memory 's pictures fading in their frames ;</l>
     <l n="131">Yet life is lovelier for these transient gleams</l>
     <l n="132">Of buried friendships ; blest is he who dreams !</l>

     <l n="26">Nor asked a leaflet from the laurel 's bough</l>

     <l n="32">And tender memories touch the faltering choir .</l>
     <l n="33">He sings no more on earth ; our vain desire</l>
     <l n="34">Aches for the voice we loved so long to hear</l>
     <l n="35">In Dorian flute-notes breathing soft and clear ,—</l>
     <l n="36">The sweet contralto that could never tire .</l>
     <l n="37">Deafened with listening to a harsher strain ,</l>
     <l n="38">The Maenad 's scream , the stark barbarian 's cry ,</l>
     <l n="39">Still for those soothing , loving tones we sigh ;</l>
     <l n="40">Oh , for our vanished Orpheus once again !</l>
     <l n="41">The shadowy silence hears us call in vain !</l>
     <l n="42">His lips are hushed ; his song shall never die .</l>
