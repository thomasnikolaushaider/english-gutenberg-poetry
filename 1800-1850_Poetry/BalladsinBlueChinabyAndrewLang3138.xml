  <body>
   <p>Thirty years have passed , like a watch in the night , since the earlier of the two sets of verses here reprinted , Ballades in Blue China , was published . At first there were but twenty-two Ballades ; ten more were added later . They appeared in a little white vellum wrapper , with a little blue Chinese singer copied from a porcelain jar ; and the frontispiece was a little design by an etcher now famous .</p>
   <p>Thirty years ago blue china was a kind of fetish in some circles , aesthetic circles , of which the balladist was not a member .</p>
   <p>The ballade was an old French form of verse , in France revived by Theodore de Banville , and restored to an England which had long forgotten the Middle Ages , by my friends Mr. Austin Dobson and Mr. Edmund Gosse . They , so far as I can trust my memory , were the first to reintroduce these pleasant old French nugae , while an anonymous author let loose upon the town a whole winged flock of ballades of amazing dexterity . This unknown balladist was Mr. Henley ; perhaps he was the first Englishman who ever burst into a double ballade , and his translations of two of Villon 's ballades into modern thieves ’ slang were marvels of dexterity . Mr. Swinburne wrote a serious ballade , but the form , I venture to think , is not ‘ wholly serious , ’ of its nature , in modern days ; and he did not persevere . Nor did the taste for these trifles long endure . A good ballade is almost as rare as a good sonnet , but a middling ballade is almost as easily written as the majority of sonnets . Either form readily becomes mechanical , cheap and facile . I have heard Mr. George Meredith improvise a sonnet , a Petrarchian sonnet , obedient to the rules , without pen and paper . He spoke ‘ and the numbers came ’ ; he sonneted as easily as a living poet , in his Eton days , improvised Latin elegiacs and Greek hexameters .</p>
   <p>The sonnet endures . Mr. Horace Hutchinson wrote somewhere : “ When you have read a sonnet , you feel that though there does not seem to be much of it , you have done a good deal , as when you have eaten a cold hard-boiled egg . ” Still people keep on writing sonnets , because the sonnet is wholly serious . In an English sonnet you cannot easily be flippant of pen . A few great poets have written immortal sonnets — among them are Milton , Wordsworth , and Keats . Thus the sonnet is a thing which every poet thinks it worth while to try at ; like Felix Arvers , he may be made immortal by a single sonnet . Even I have written one too many ! Every anthologist wants to anthologise it ( The Odyssey ) ; it never was a favourite of my own , though it had the honour to be kindly spoken of by Mr. Matthew Arnold .</p>
   <p>On the other hand , no man since Francois Villon has been immortalised by a single ballade — Mais ou sont les neiges d'antan ?</p>
   <p>To speak in any detail about these poor ballades would be to indite a part of an autobiography . Looking back at the little book , ‘ what memories it stirs ’ in one to whom</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">‘ Fate has done this wrong ,</l>
     <l n="2">That I should write too much and live too long . ’</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">The Ballade of the Tweed , and the Rhymes a la Mode , were dedicated</l>
     <l n="4">to the dearest of kinsmen , a cricketer and angler . The Ballade of</l>
     <l n="5">Roulette was inscribed to R. R ., a gallant veteran of the Indian</l>
     <l n="6">Mutiny , a leader of Light Horse , whose father was a friend of Sir</l>
     <l n="7">Walter Scott . He was himself a Borderer , in whose defeats on the</l>
     <l n="8">green field of Roulette I often shared , long , long ago .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>So many have gone ‘ into the world of light ’ that it is a happiness to think of him to whom The Ballade of Golf was dedicated , and to remember that he is still capable of scoring his double century at cricket , and of lifting the ball high over the trees beyond the boundaries of a great cricket-field . Perhaps Mr. Leslie Balfour - Melville will pardon me for mentioning his name , linked as it is with so many common memories . ‘ One is taken and another left . ’</p>
   <p>A different sort of memory attaches itself to A Ballade of Dead Cities . It was written in a Theocritean amoebean way , in competition with Mr. Edmund Gosse ; he need not be ashamed of the circumstance , for another shepherd , who was umpire , awarded the prize ( two kids just severed from their dams ) to his victorious muse .</p>
   <p>The Ballade of the Midnight Forest , the Ballade of the Huntress Artemis , was translated from Theodore de Banville , whose beautiful poem came so near the Greek , that when the late Provost of Oriel translated a part of its English shadow into Greek hexameters , you might suppose , as you read , that they were part of a lost Homeric Hymn .</p>
   <p>I never wrote a double ballade , and stanzas four and five of the Double Ballade of Primitive Man were contributed by the learned doyen of Anthropology , Mr. E. B. Tylor , author of Primitive Culture .</p>
   <p>A tout seigneur tout honneur !</p>
   <p>In Ballade of his Choice of a Sepulchre , the Windburg is a hill in Teviotdale . A Portrait of 1783 was written on a French engraving after Morland , and Benedetta Ramus was addressed to a mezzotint ( an artist 's proof , ‘ very rare ’ ) . It is after Romney and is ‘ My Beauty , ’ as Charles Lamb said ( once , unluckily , to a Scot ) of an engraving , after Lionardo , of some fair dead lady .</p>
   <p>The sonnet , Natural Theology , is the germ of what the author has since written , in The Making of Religion , on the long neglected fact that many of the lowest savages known share the belief in a benevolent All Father and Judge of men .</p>
   <p>Concerning verses in Rhymes a la Mode , visitors to St. Andrews may be warned not to visit St. Leonard 's Chapel , described in the second stanza of Almae Matres . In the writer 's youth , and even in middle age ,</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">He loitered idly where the tall</l>
     <l n="2">Fresh-budded mountain-ashes blow</l>
     <l n="3">Within its desecrated wall .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The once beautiful ruins carpeted with grass and wild flowers have been doubly desecrated by persons , academic persons , having authority and a plentiful lack of taste . The slim mountain-ashes , fair as the young palm-tree that Odysseus saw beside the shrine of Apollo in Delos , have been cut down by the academic persons to whom power is given . The grass and flowers have been rooted up . Hideous little wooden fences enclose the grave slabs : a roof of a massive kind has been dumped down on the old walls , and the windows , once so graceful in their airy lines , have been glazed in a horrible manner , while the ugly iron gate precludes entrance to a shrine which is now a black and dismal dungeon .</p>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ Oh , be that roof as lead to lead</l>
     <l n="2">Above the dull Restorer 's head ,</l>
     <l n="3">A Minstrel 's malison is said ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="4">Notes explanatory are added to the Rhymes , and their information ,</l>
     <l n="5">however valuable , need not here be repeated .</l>

    <head>NIGHT .</head>
     <l n="1">Ah , listen through the music , from the shore ,</l>
     <l n="2">The “ melancholy long-withdrawing roar ” ;</l>
     <l n="3">Beneath the Minster , and the windy caves ,</l>
     <l n="4">The wide North Ocean , marshalling his waves</l>
     <l n="5">Even so forlorn — in worlds beyond our ken -</l>
     <l n="6">May sigh the seas that are not heard of men ;</l>
     <l n="7">Even so forlorn , prophetic of man 's fate ,</l>
     <l n="8">Sounded the cold sea-wave disconsolate ,</l>
     <l n="9">When none but God might hear the boding tone ,</l>
     <l n="10">As God shall hear the long lament alone ,</l>
     <l n="11">When all is done , when all the tale is told ,</l>
     <l n="12">And the gray sea-wave echoes as of old !</l>

     <l n="13">WOMAN AND THE WEED .</l>
     <l n="14">( FOUNDED ON A NEW ZEALAND MYTH . )</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="15">In the Morning of Time , when his fortunes began ,</l>
     <l n="16">How bleak , how un-Greek , was the Nature of Man !</l>
     <l n="17">From his wigwam , if ever he ventured to roam ,</l>
     <l n="18">There was nobody waiting to welcome him home ;</l>
     <l n="19">For the Man had been made , but the woman had NOT ,</l>
     <l n="20">And Earth was a highly detestable spot .</l>
     <l n="21">Man hated his neighbours ; they met and they scowled ,</l>
     <l n="22">They did not converse but they struggled and howled ,</l>
     <l n="23">For Man had no tact — he would ne'er take a hint ,</l>
     <l n="24">And his notions he backed with a hatchet of flint .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="25">So Man was alone , and he wished he could see</l>
     <l n="26">On the Earth some one like him , but fairer than he ,</l>
     <l n="27">With locks like the red gold , a smile like the sun ,</l>
     <l n="28">To welcome him back when his hunting was done .</l>
     <l n="29">And he sighed for a voice that should answer him still ,</l>
     <l n="30">Like the affable Echo he heard on the hill :</l>
     <l n="31">That should answer him softly and always agree ,</l>
     <l n="32">AND OH , Man reflected , HOW NICE IT WOULD BE !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="33">So he prayed to the Gods , and they stooped to his prayer ,</l>
     <l n="34">And they spoke to the Sun on his way through the air ,</l>
     <l n="35">And he married the Echo one fortunate morn ,</l>
     <l n="36">And Woman , their beautiful daughter , was born !</l>
     <l n="37">The daughter of Sunshine and Echo she came</l>
     <l n="38">With a voice like a song , with a face like a flame ;</l>
     <l n="39">With a face like a flame , and a voice like a song ,</l>
     <l n="40">And happy was Man , but it was not for long !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="41">For weather 's a painfully changeable thing ,</l>
     <l n="42">Not always the child of the Echo would sing ;</l>
     <l n="43">And the face of the Sun may be hidden with mist ,</l>
     <l n="44">And his child can be terribly cross if she list .</l>
     <l n="45">And unfortunate Man had to learn with surprise</l>
     <l n="46">That a frown 's not peculiar to masculine eyes ;</l>
     <l n="47">That the sweetest of voices can scold and can sneer ,</l>
     <l n="48">And cannot be answered — like men — with a spear .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="49">So Man went and called to the Gods in his woe ,</l>
     <l n="50">And they answered him — “ Sir , you would needs have it so :</l>
     <l n="51">And the thing must go on as the thing has begun ,</l>
     <l n="52">She 's immortal — your child of the Echo and Sun .</l>
     <l n="53">But we 'll send you another , and fairer is she ,</l>
     <l n="54">This maiden with locks that are flowing and free .</l>
     <l n="55">This maiden so gentle , so kind , and so fair ,</l>
     <l n="56">With a flower like a star in the night of her hair .</l>
     <l n="57">With her eyes like the smoke that is misty and blue ,</l>
     <l n="58">With her heart that is heavenly , and tender , and true .</l>
     <l n="59">She will die in the night , but no need you should mourn ,</l>
     <l n="60">You shall bury her body and thence shall be born</l>
     <l n="61">A weed that is green , that is fragrant and fair ,</l>
     <l n="62">With a flower like the star in the night of her hair .</l>
     <l n="63">And the leaves must ye burn till they offer to you</l>
     <l n="64">Soft smoke , like her eyes that are misty and blue .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="65">“ And the smoke shall ye breathe and no more shall ye fret ,</l>
     <l n="66">But the child of the Echo and Sun shall forget :</l>
     <l n="67">Shall forget all the trouble and torment she brings ,</l>
     <l n="68">Shall bethink ye of none but delectable things ;</l>
     <l n="69">And the sound of the wars with your brethren shall cease ,</l>
     <l n="70">While ye smoke by the camp-fire the great pipe of peace . ”</l>
     <l n="71">So the last state of Man was by no means the worst ,</l>
     <l n="72">The second gift softened the sting of the first .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="73">Nor the child of the Echo and Sun doth he heed</l>
     <l n="74">When he dreams with the Maid that was changed to the weed ;</l>
     <l n="75">Though the Echo be silent , the Sun in a mist ,</l>
     <l n="76">The Maid is the fairest that ever was kissed .</l>
     <l n="77">And when tempests are over and ended the rain ,</l>
     <l n="78">And the child of the Sunshine is sunny again ,</l>
     <l n="79">He comes back , glad at heart , and again is at one</l>
     <l n="80">With the changeable child of the Echo and Sun .</l>
