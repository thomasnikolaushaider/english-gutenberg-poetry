    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="24">Here is cruel Frederick , see !</l>
     <l n="25">A horrid wicked boy was he ;</l>
     <l n="26">He caught the flies , poor little things ,</l>
     <l n="27">And then tore off their tiny wings ,</l>
     <l n="28">He killed the birds , and broke the chairs ,</l>
     <l n="29">And threw the kitten down the stairs ;</l>
     <l n="30">And oh ! far worse than all beside ,</l>
     <l n="31">He whipped his Mary , till she cried .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="32">The trough was full , and faithful Tray</l>
     <l n="33">Came out to drink one sultry day ;</l>
     <l n="34">He wagged his tail , and wet his lip ,</l>

     <l n="40">Then you should only have been by ,</l>
     <l n="41">To see how Fred did scream and cry !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="42">So Frederick had to go to bed :</l>
     <l n="43">His leg was very sore and red !</l>
     <l n="44">The Doctor came , and shook his head ,</l>
     <l n="45">And made a very great to-do ,</l>

     <l n="47">But good dog Tray is happy now ;</l>
     <l n="48">He has no time to say “ Bow-wow ! ”</l>
     <l n="49">He seats himself in Frederick 's chair</l>
     <l n="50">And laughs to see the nice things there :</l>
     <l n="51">The soup he swallows , sup by sup —</l>
     <l n="52">And eats the pies and puddings up .</l>

     <l n="53">The Dreadful Story of Harriet and the Matches</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="54">It almost makes me cry to tell</l>
     <l n="55">What foolish Harriet befell .</l>
     <l n="56">Mamma and Nurse went out one day</l>
     <l n="57">And left her all alone at play .</l>
     <l n="58">Now , on the table close at hand ,</l>
     <l n="59">A box of matches chanced to stand ;</l>
     <l n="60">And kind Mamma and Nurse had told her ,</l>
     <l n="61">That , if she touched them , they would scold her .</l>
     <l n="62">But Harriet said : “ Oh , what a pity !</l>
     <l n="63">For , when they burn , it is so pretty ;</l>
     <l n="64">They crackle so , and spit , and flame :</l>
     <l n="65">Mamma , too , often does the same . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="66">The pussy-cats heard this ,</l>
     <l n="67">And they began to hiss ,</l>
     <l n="68">And stretch their claws ,</l>
     <l n="69">And raise their paws ;</l>
     <l n="70">“ Me-ow , ” they said , “ me-ow , me-o ,</l>
     <l n="71">You 'll burn to death , if you do so . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="72">But Harriet would not take advice :</l>
     <l n="73">She lit a match , it was so nice !</l>
     <l n="74">It crackled so , it burned so clear —</l>
     <l n="75">Exactly like the picture here .</l>
     <l n="76">She jumped for joy and ran about</l>
     <l n="77">And was too pleased to put it out .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="78">The Pussy-cats saw this</l>
     <l n="79">And said : “ Oh , naughty , naughty Miss ! ”</l>
     <l n="80">And stretched their claws ,</l>
     <l n="81">And raised their paws :</l>
     <l n="82">“ ‘ Tis very , very wrong , you know ,</l>
     <l n="83">Me-ow , me-o , me-ow , me-o ,</l>
     <l n="84">You will be burnt , if you do so . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="85">And see ! oh , what dreadful thing !</l>
     <l n="86">The fire has caught her apron-string ;</l>
     <l n="87">Her apron burns , her arms , her hair —</l>
     <l n="88">She burns all over everywhere .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="89">Then how the pussy-cats did mew —</l>
     <l n="90">What else , poor pussies , could they do ?</l>
     <l n="91">They screamed for help , ‘ twas all in vain !</l>
     <l n="92">So then they said : “ We 'll scream again ;</l>
     <l n="93">Make haste , make haste , me-ow , me-o ,</l>
     <l n="94">She 'll burn to death ; we told her so . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="95">So she was burnt , with all her clothes ,</l>
     <l n="96">And arms , and hands , and eyes , and nose ;</l>
     <l n="97">Till she had nothing more to lose</l>
     <l n="98">Except her little scarlet shoes ;</l>
     <l n="99">And nothing else but these was found</l>
     <l n="100">Among her ashes on the ground .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="19">
     <l n="101">And when the good cats sat beside</l>
     <l n="102">The smoking ashes , how they cried !</l>
     <l n="103">“ Me-ow , me-oo , me-ow , me-oo ,</l>
     <l n="104">What will Mamma and Nursey do ? ”</l>
     <l n="105">Their tears ran down their cheeks so fast ,</l>
     <l n="106">They made a little pond at last .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="20">
     <l n="107">The Story of the Inky Boys</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="21">
     <l n="108">As he had often done before ,</l>
     <l n="109">The woolly-headed Black-a-moor</l>
     <l n="110">One nice fine summer 's day went out</l>
     <l n="111">To see the shops , and walk about ;</l>
     <l n="112">And , as he found it hot , poor fellow ,</l>
     <l n="113">He took with him his green umbrella ,</l>
     <l n="114">Then Edward , little noisy wag ,</l>
     <l n="115">Ran out and laughed , and waved his flag ;</l>
     <l n="116">And William came in jacket trim ,</l>
     <l n="117">And brought his wooden hoop with him ;</l>
     <l n="118">And Arthur , too , snatched up his toys</l>
     <l n="119">And joined the other naughty boys .</l>
     <l n="120">So , one and all set up a roar ,</l>
     <l n="121">And laughed and hooted more and more ,</l>
     <l n="122">And kept on singing ,— only think !—</l>
     <l n="123">“ Oh , Blacky , you 're as black as ink ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="22">
     <l n="124">Now tall Agrippa lived close by —</l>
     <l n="125">So tall , he almost touched the sky ;</l>
     <l n="126">He had a mighty inkstand , too ,</l>
     <l n="127">In which a great goose-feather grew ;</l>
     <l n="128">He called out in an angry tone</l>
     <l n="129">“ Boys , leave the Black-a-moor alone !</l>
     <l n="130">For , if he tries with all his might ,</l>
     <l n="131">He cannot change from black to white . ”</l>
     <l n="132">But , ah ! they did not mind a bit</l>
     <l n="133">What great Agrippa said of it ;</l>
     <l n="134">But went on laughing , as before ,</l>
     <l n="135">And hooting at the Black-a-moor .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="23">
     <l n="136">Then great Agrippa foams with rage —</l>
     <l n="137">Look at him on this very page !</l>
     <l n="138">He seizes Arthur , seizes Ned ,</l>
     <l n="139">Takes William by his little head ;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="24">
     <l n="140">And they may scream and kick and call ,</l>
     <l n="141">Into the ink he dips them all ;</l>
     <l n="142">Into the inkstand , one , two , three ,</l>
     <l n="143">Till they are black as black can be ;</l>
     <l n="144">Turn over now , and you shall see .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="25">
     <l n="145">See , there they are , and there they run !</l>
     <l n="146">The Black-a-moor enjoys the fun .</l>
     <l n="147">They have been made as black as crows ,</l>
     <l n="148">Quite black all over , eyes and nose ,</l>
     <l n="149">And legs , and arms , and heads , and toes ,</l>
     <l n="150">And trousers , pinafores , and toys —</l>
     <l n="151">The silly little inky boys !</l>
     <l n="152">Because they set up such a roar ,</l>
     <l n="153">And teased the harmless Black-a-moor .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="26">
     <l n="154">The Story of the Man that went out Shooting</l>

     <l n="155">This is the man that shoots the hares ;</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="28">
     <l n="159">He finds it hard , without a pair</l>
     <l n="160">Of spectacles , to shoot the hare .</l>
     <l n="161">The hare sits snug in leaves and grass ,</l>
     <l n="162">And laughs to see the green man pass .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="29">
     <l n="163">Now , as the sun grew very hot ,</l>
     <l n="164">And he a heavy gun had got ,</l>
     <l n="165">He lay down underneath a tree</l>
     <l n="166">And went to sleep , as you may see .</l>
     <l n="167">And , while he slept like any top ,</l>
     <l n="168">The little hare came , hop , hop , hop ,</l>
     <l n="169">Took gun and spectacles , and then</l>
     <l n="170">On her hind legs went off again .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="30">
     <l n="171">The green man wakes and sees her place</l>

     <l n="174">To shoot the sleepy , green-coat man .</l>
     <l n="175">He cries and screams and runs away ;</l>
     <l n="176">The hare runs after him all day</l>
     <l n="177">And hears him call out everywhere :</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="31">
     <l n="179">At last he stumbled at the well ,</l>
