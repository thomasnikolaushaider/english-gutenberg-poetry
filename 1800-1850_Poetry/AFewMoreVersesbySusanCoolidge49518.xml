     <l n="3">A myriad thirsty shores await the tide :</l>
     <l n="4">They drink and drink , and will not be denied ;</l>
     <l n="5">But not a drop less full the brimming Sea .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="6">One tiny shell among the kelp and weed ,</l>
     <l n="7">One sand-grain where the beaches stretch away ,—</l>

     <l n="7">How hard it strives , and how in vain ,</l>

    <head>A SINGLE STITCH .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">ONE stitch dropped as the weaver drove</l>
     <l n="2">His nimble shuttle to and fro ,</l>
     <l n="3">In and out , beneath , above ,</l>
     <l n="4">Till the pattern seemed to bud and grow</l>
     <l n="5">As if the fairies had helping been ,—</l>
     <l n="6">One small stitch which could scarce be seen .</l>
     <l n="7">But the one stitch dropped pulled the next stitch out ,</l>
     <l n="8">And a weak place grew in the fabric stout ;</l>
     <l n="9">And the perfect pattern was marred for aye</l>
     <l n="10">By the one small stitch that was dropped that day .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="11">One small life in God ’ s great plan ,</l>
     <l n="12">How futile it seems as the ages roll ,</l>
     <l n="13">Do what it may , or strive how it can</l>
     <l n="14">To alter the sweep of the infinite whole !</l>
     <l n="15">A single stitch in an endless web ,</l>
     <l n="16">A drop in the ocean ’ s flow and ebb !</l>
     <l n="17">But the pattern is rent where the stitch is lost ,</l>
     <l n="18">Or marred where the tangled threads have crossed ;</l>
     <l n="19">And each life that fails of its true intent</l>
     <l n="20">Mars the perfect plan that its Master meant .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ WHAT , then , is Love ?” she said .</l>
     <l n="2">Love is a music , blent in curious key</l>
     <l n="3">Of jarring discords and of harmony ;</l>
     <l n="4">’ Tis a delicious draught which , as you sip ,</l>
     <l n="5">Turns sometimes into poison on your lip .</l>
     <l n="6">It is a sunny sky infolding storm ,</l>
     <l n="7">The fire to ruin or the fire to warm ;</l>
     <l n="8">A garland of fresh roses fair to sight ,</l>
     <l n="9">Which then becomes a chain and fetters tight .</l>
     <l n="10">It is a half-heard secret told to two ,</l>
     <l n="11">A life-long puzzle or a guiding clew .</l>
     <l n="12">The joy of joys , the deepest pain of pain ;—</l>
     <l n="13">All these Love has been and will be again .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="14">“ How may I know ?” she said .</l>
     <l n="15">Thou mayest not know , for Love has conned the art</l>
     <l n="16">To blind the reason and befool the heart .</l>
     <l n="17">So subtle is he , not himself may guess</l>
     <l n="18">Whether he shall be more or shall be less ;</l>
     <l n="19">Wrapped in a veil of many colored mists ,</l>
     <l n="20">He flits disguisèd wheresoe ’ er he lists ,</l>
     <l n="21">And for the moment is the thing he seems ,</l>
     <l n="22">The child of vagrant hope and fairy dreams ;</l>
     <l n="23">Sails like a rainbow bubble on the wind ,</l>
     <l n="24">Now high , now low , before us or behind ;</l>
     <l n="25">And only when our fingers grasp the prize ,</l>
     <l n="26">Changes his form and swiftly vanishes .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="27">“ Then best not love ,” she said .</l>
     <l n="28">Dear child , there is no better and no best ;</l>
     <l n="29">Love comes not , bides not at thy slight behest .</l>
     <l n="30">As well might thy frail fingers seek to stay</l>
     <l n="31">The march of waves in yonder land-locked bay ,</l>
     <l n="32">As stem the surging tide which ebbs and fills</l>
     <l n="33">Mid human energies and human wills .</l>
     <l n="34">The moon leads on the strong , resisting sea ;</l>
     <l n="35">And so the moon of love shall beckon thee ,</l>
     <l n="36">And at her bidding thou wilt leap and rise ,</l>
     <l n="37">And follow o ’ er strange seas , ’ neath unknown skies ,</l>
     <l n="38">Unquestioning ; to dash , or soon or late ,</l>

     <l n="2">To hear my story , hear the whole of it ?</l>
     <l n="3">And with a shamefaced air and reddened cheek</l>
     <l n="4">That “ others know it all , and why not thou ?”</l>
     <l n="5">Who has been talking to thee of me , then ;</l>
     <l n="6">Setting thee on to question and suspect ?</l>
     <l n="7">Ah , boy , with eyes still full of childish dreams ,</l>
     <l n="8">And yet with manhood on the firm young lip ,</l>
     <l n="9">’ Tis a hard thing to ask me , and a strange !</l>
     <l n="10">A woman does not easily lay bare</l>
     <l n="11">Her history , which is her very heart ,</l>
     <l n="12">Even to that piece of her she calls her son !</l>
     <l n="13">Son he may be , but still he is a man ,</l>
     <l n="14">And she , though mother , is a woman still ;</l>
     <l n="15">And men and women are made different ,</l>
     <l n="16">And vainly ’ gainst the barrier of sex</l>
     <l n="17">They beat and beat ,— all their lives long they beat ,</l>
     <l n="18">And never pass , never quite understand !</l>
     <l n="19">Yet must I do this hard thing for thy sake ,</l>
     <l n="20">Since who shall do it for thee , if not I ?</l>
     <l n="21">Thy father , who had else more fitly told ,</l>
     <l n="22">Is at the wars , the weary , wasting wars ;—</l>
     <l n="23">Long years ago he sailed unto the wars ,</l>
     <l n="24">And , dead or living , comes not back to us .</l>
     <l n="25">Unhappy is the son who , woman-bred ,</l>
     <l n="26">Knows not the firm feel of a father ’ s hand ;</l>

     <l n="29">Must frame my faltering tongue to tell the tale ,</l>
     <l n="30">And snatch my thoughts back from their present pain</l>
     <l n="31">To the old days , the hard and cruel days ,</l>
     <l n="32">Full of sharp hatred and stern vengeances ,</l>
     <l n="33">Which yet were beautiful to him and me</l>
     <l n="34">Who lived and loved each other and were young ;</l>
     <l n="35">But unto thee , born in a softer hour ,</l>
     <l n="36">Come as dim echoes of some warlike peal .</l>

     <l n="37">Thou bearest an honorable name , my son ,</l>
     <l n="38">Two mighty houses meet and blend in thee ;</l>

     <l n="40">Of Bardi , lords of Florence in past time ,</l>
     <l n="41">Was daughter , and thy sire Ippolito</l>
     <l n="42">Sprang from the Buondelmonti , their sworn foes ;</l>
     <l n="43">For we were Guelph and they were Ghibelline ,</l>
     <l n="44">And centuries of wrong , and seas of blood ,</l>
     <l n="45">And old traditional hatreds sundered us .</l>
     <l n="46">Even in my babyhood I heard the name</l>
     <l n="47">Of Buondelmonti uttered ’ twixt set teeth</l>
     <l n="48">And coupled with a curse , and I would pout ,</l>
     <l n="49">And knit my brows , and clench my tiny fist</l>
     <l n="50">And whimper at the very sound of it ;</l>
     <l n="51">Whereat my father , stout Amérigo ,</l>
     <l n="52">Would catch me up and toss me overhead ,</l>
     <l n="53">And swear I was best Bardi of them all ;</l>
     <l n="54">And if his sons but matched his only maid</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="57">So I grew</l>

     <l n="60">To hum and cluster wheresoe ’ er I moved ;</l>
     <l n="61">And then there came the day ,— that fateful day ,</l>
     <l n="62">When little Gian , my father ’ s latest born ,</l>
     <l n="63">Was carried for chrism to the baptistery ;</l>
     <l n="64">And standing , all unaware , beside the font ,</l>
     <l n="65">I looked across the dim and crowded church</l>
     <l n="66">And saw a face — a dazzling , youthful face !</l>
     <l n="67">A face that smote my vision like a star ;</l>
     <l n="68">With golden locks , and eyes divinely bright</l>
     <l n="69">Like San Michele in the picture there —</l>
     <l n="70">Fixed upon mine .</l>

     <l n="74">My father ’ s daughter sure had turned away .</l>
     <l n="75">But nothing warned me , nothing hindered him ;</l>
     <l n="76">We looked upon each other , Fate so willed ,</l>
     <l n="77">And with our eyes our hearts met !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="78">“ Cursed cur ,”</l>
     <l n="79">My brother muttered , fingering at his sword ,</l>
     <l n="80">“ I ’ ll teach you to ogle us when this is done !”</l>
     <l n="81">“ Who is it , then ?” I whispered , and he told ;</l>
     <l n="82">And with the name I felt my heart like lead</l>
     <l n="83">Turn cold and cold and suddenly sink down .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="84">And still that tender , radiant gaze wooed mine ,</l>
     <l n="85">And still I felt the enchantment burn and burn ,</l>
     <l n="86">But would not turn my head or look again ;</l>
     <l n="87">And all that night I lay and felt those eyes ,</l>
     <l n="88">And day by day they seemed to follow me ,</l>
     <l n="89">Like unknown planets of some strange new heaven</l>
     <l n="90">Whose depths I dared not question or explore ;</l>
     <l n="91">And love and hate so strove for mastery</l>
     <l n="92">Within my girl ’ s heart , made their battle-field ,</l>
     <l n="93">That all my forces failed and life grew faint .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="94">He , for his part , set forth with heart afire</l>

     <l n="96">Leaving the learner stricken with a chill !</l>
     <l n="97">And after that , whenever I might go</l>
     <l n="98">To ball or feast , I saw him , only him !</l>
     <l n="99">And while the other cavaliers pressed round</l>
     <l n="100">To praise my face or dress , or hold my fan ,</l>
     <l n="101">Or bid me to the dance , he stood aloof</l>
     <l n="102">With passionate eyes , but never might draw near .</l>
     <l n="103">For still my brother Piero or my sire</l>
     <l n="104">Were close behind , with dark set brows intent</l>
     <l n="105">To watch him that he did not dare to speak .</l>
     <l n="106">Only his eyes met mine , and in my cheeks</l>
     <l n="107">I felt the guilty color grow and grow ;</l>
     <l n="108">And once , when all were masqued , amid the crowd</l>
     <l n="109">A hand touched mine , and oh , I knew ’ twas his !</l>
     <l n="110">At last , with baffling of his heart-sick hope</l>
     <l n="111">And long suspense and sorrow , he fell ill ;</l>
     <l n="112">And in a moment when life ’ s tide ran low</l>
     <l n="113">He told his mother all ; she , loving him well</l>
     <l n="114">And loath to see him perish thus forlorn ,</l>
     <l n="115">Became his ally , spoke him words of cheer ,</l>
     <l n="116">And with my cousin Contessa , her sworn friend ,</l>
     <l n="117">She counsel took ; and so , betwixt the two ,</l>
     <l n="118">It came about that on a day of spring</l>
     <l n="119">When almond blossoms whitened the brown boughs</l>
     <l n="120">And olives were in bud and all birds sang ,</l>
     <l n="121">We met ,— a meeting cunningly contrived ,</l>
     <l n="122">In an old villa garden past the walls .</l>
     <l n="123">My mother had led me thither , knowing naught ,</l>
     <l n="124">And I , naught knowing , had wandered for a space</l>
     <l n="125">Among the boskage and the fragrant vines ,</l>
     <l n="126">And , standing by a water-fount of stone</l>
     <l n="127">Listening the tinkle and the cool , wet splash</l>
     <l n="128">Of the thin drip , and thinking still of him</l>
     <l n="129">( For I went thinking of him all the day ) ,</l>
     <l n="130">I heard the soft throb of a mandolin ,</l>
     <l n="131">And next a voice , divinely sweet it seemed ,</l>
     <l n="132">A voice unheard till then , and yet I knew</l>
     <l n="133">The voice for his ; and this the song it sang :—</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>“ Ah , thorns so sharp , so strong ! Ah , path so hard , so long ! What do I care ? Thither I fare ! My Rose is there !</p>

     <l n="1">The music ceased , the while spell-bound I stayed ;</l>

     <l n="3">Few moments might we stay , and few words speak ;</l>
