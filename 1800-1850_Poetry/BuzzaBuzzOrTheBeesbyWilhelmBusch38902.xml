  <body>
   <p>I must say a few words in explanation of the somewhat novel form which my new “ Bee-Book ” has taken , and which , doubtless , will be a surprise to the many Bee-Friends who are waiting with exemplary patience for the second edition of my original “ Bee-Book , ” soon about to appear after an interval of thirty years from the publication of the first edition .</p>
   <p>I happened last year to be at the Cologne Station , waiting for the train , and employed my spare time in looking over the book stall for something to read on my way to Aix-la-Chapelle . The stall was covered with books about the late War . I had returned from a visit to the Battle Fields of 1870 , and was sick of the subject . I wanted something of a more peaceful nature , and I was turning away , without making a purchase , when a book met my eye entitled Schnurrdiburr . What that might mean I knew not , but the second title , oder die Bienen , was intelligible , and had attraction enough for me . I opened it , and saw it was profusely illustrated with very comical cuts . I paid my Thaler and carried away my prize .</p>
   <p>The cuts are reproduced in the book which my readers have in their hands . The verses were written up to the pictures rather than translated from the German text ; for alas ! my German is very limited ; enough for travelling purposes , but hardly enough to enable me to read a Bee-Book either serious or comical .</p>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>RIDENTEM DICERE VERUM QUID VETAT ?</head>
    <head>There is much truth lying hid under these comical stories ; still more in the illustrations ; and the notes which I have appended may be found useful even by serious Bee-Masters .</head>
     <l n="1">I promise my readers that they shall have the second edition of “ MY BEE</l>
     <l n="2">BOOK ” as perfect as I can make it , and with as little delay as possible .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>I trust it may be much nearer perfection than the first edition , published under great difficulties , could be , and I hope it may have as many purchasers as this its forerunner .</p>

    <head>Notes on Buzz-a-Buzz ,</head>
    <p n="1">APIARIAN , CLASSICAL , POETICAL , AND NONDESCRIPT .</p>
    <p n="2">PRELUDE .</p>
    <p n="3">HAIL MUSE ! &amp; c .— An Invocation to the Muses , both terse and expressive . Possibly not quite original , as I have a dim recollection that a certain obscure poet called Byron , whose works are now well nigh forgotten , made use of it .</p>
    <p n="4">PEGGY .— A name dear to the writer , as that of the first pony which he ever had of his very own — the gift of a kind Godfather — of a different sex indeed from Pegasus . There is , therefore , some hopes that the breed may have been preserved , but , as far as my experience goes , I may regretfully say ,</p>
    <p n="5">Quando ullam inveniam parem .</p>
    <p n="6">I have , alas , grown stout ; and it requires a strong cob to carry twenty stone , and go lively under it as well . Such a mount fetches a long price , which does not suit a short purse ; and such Godfathers , alas ! abierunt ad plures ; their successors give no such gifts to their Godchildren .</p>
    <p n="7">PARNASSUS GREEN .— Not at all the same sort of place as Paddington Green . The latter is now familiarly haunted by our Comic song writers , those most dolorous of all funny men . Parnassus Green stands , from the necessity of rhyme , for Green Parnassus .</p>
    <p n="8">HIPPOCRENE .— The first horse drinking fountain , and produced , moreover , by a stamp of Peggy 's hoof . This would be a good subject for a drinking fountain of the present day . I make a present of the idea to any young sculptor who has a commission from one of our merchant princes , and is hard up for a subject . The most approved receipt for developing a poetic temperament was to sleep on Parnassus , and drink of Hippocrene in the morn . Persius has it ,</p>
    <p n="9">“ Non fonte labra prolui caballino , Nec in bicipiti somniasse Parnasso Memini , ut repente sic poeta prodirem . ”</p>
    <p n="10">No more have I ; and perhaps some of my readers may say that I should have done better had I waited for a sleep on Parnassus , and a drink of Hippocrene before I began to write . All I can say is , I hope to take one next year , if I visit Greece .</p>
    <p n="11">FYTTE I .— Page 1-7 .— The fun of this first Fytte will be “ real nuts ” to every Bee-master . The whole economy of a Hive is viewed from a human stand-point . The sentinels watching with their own stings in their hands as lances ; the early labours of the chamber and house maids ; the architects setting out the day 's work ; the swaddling clothes and pap boat for the Grub Royal ; the State of the Queen ; the idleness of the drones : all is well told , at least in the wood cuts .</p>
    <p n="12">“ PIG IN THE GARDEN STRAYED AROUND . ” — Page 8 .— A very improper place for Pig to take his constitutional walk . The wicket gate which leads to your Hives should be always properly secured , or results very different from the fattening of a pig may be produced . For what is possible , though not very probable , see one of the early chapters of Maryatt 's Mr. Midshipman Easy .</p>
    <p n="13">“ WAS ERST ALL LEAN , WAS NOW ALL FAT . ” — Page 10 .— The alteration of the animal tissue in consequence of a sting is very wonderful ; it is certainly not fat which is deposited . So that this method of getting Bacon Pigs ready for market , though it would save corn , would not be satisfactory to the Bacon Curer when he puts his flitches in salt , still less to the cook , when frying a rasher .</p>
    <p n="14">“ FLY FORTH , DEAR BEE , ‘ TIS MORN , FLY FORTH . ” — Page 11 .— I shall be obliged to any one of my many friends , skilled in Musical Composition , if they will set this original Bee song . The prelude and refrain offer a fine opportunity for a Buzz-a-Buzz effect . On receipt of a satisfactory production I will forward to the Composer a bound copy of Buzz-a-Buzz , with the translator 's autograph . Inestimable reward !</p>
    <p n="15">JOHN DULL SITS WAITING FOR A SWARM .— Page 11 .— as I have done for many an hour , and lost the swarm after all . John Dull drops asleep whilst watching . I have often ceased watching just as the swarm was about to rise . The Bees choose their own time , which is not always that which the Bee master would for them . But the whole subject of swarming , and how to regulate it , or prevent it , will be fully treated of in the forthcoming second edition of “ My Bee Book . ”</p>
    <p n="16">“ THIS HONEY THIEF , THIS BEE-I-CIDE . ” — Page 14 .— This latter word is the invention of the learned Doctor Cumming , the Times ’ Bee-master . See a most stunning article on his Bee-Book in the Saturday Review , the second or third number for December , 1864 . The proverbial thickness of a Scotchman 's skin can alone have preserved him from dying from the effects of this stinging article . “ Docte Commenas utriusque linquoe ” say I .</p>
    <p n="17">“ CULL A CROCUS AND AN AURICULA . ” — Page 17 .— The last word was indeed a difficult one to hitch into rhyme . It has , however , been , I think , successfully overcome . I might have added another line , and made a triplet ,</p>
    <p n="18">“ Flowers which her Richard loved particular , ”</p>
    <p n="19">but I had compassion on the ears of my readers .</p>
    <p n="20">“ THE PLACE I CANNOT MORE DEFINE , “ WITHIN THE LIMITS OF A LINE . ” — Page 19 .</p>
    <p n="21">I well remember , when an Eton boy , walking in the playing fields with a late revered and beloved prelate , then a Fellow of Eton , whose memory is dear to every Etonian who knew him , as that of a kind friend and finished scholar ,— such as alas ! seem extinct in these degenerate days . He was living in a picturesque old house , “ The Warf , ” now destroyed , that his two sons , then at Eton , might still have the benefit of home associations . His daughters , and their French governess , accompanied us in this well-remembered stroll . Mademoiselle was very curious as to how the Eton boys were punished . She wanted all the details , and asked if they were whipped on their backs . The question made us all look foolish , but Dr. L. with a twinkle of his eyes , which marked his appreciation of the situation , answered , “ A little lower down , Mademoiselle , a little lower down . ”</p>
    <p n="22">“ FETCHED HIS BEE DRESS , HIS HIVE , HIS LADDER . ” — Page 23 .— A veritable Guy Mr. Dull looks in his defensive armour ! A simpler and equally efficient dress may be made of a black net bag , large enough to be drawn over a straw or felt hat , with a brim sufficiently wide to keep the net away from the prominent organ , the nose , and long enough to be buttoned into the Bee-master 's coat . A couple of elastic bands round the wrists will prevent the Bees crawling up his sleeves , the same round the ancles will secure the most timorous Bee master . “ A Lady 's dress I cannot pretend to regulate . ” See “ My Bee Book , ” where many instances of the effect of stings are given . When swarming , Bees are particularly gentle , and never sting , except when some are crushed . A true Bee-master will despise such defensive armour , but trust rather to his gentleness and knowledge of the habits of his Bees for his immunity from stings . Should he be stung , nevertheless , in spite of all precautions , let him instantly extract the sting , and apply a drop of honey to the place . This will immediately allay the smarting pain , and the swelling , except in certain places , as the eye or lip , be trifling . Eau de Luce as it is commonly called , that is , strong ammonia , is another excellent remedy ; a small bottle should be kept in every apiary in the box of “ needments . ” But above all , let the Bee-master eschew gloves , specially when delicate operations are to be performed . A cat might as soon expect to catch mice in mittens , as a Bee-master to capture a Queen with hands encased in , and fingers stiffened by , thick woollen gloves , as recommended by some .</p>
    <p n="23">“ SOME WAY I 'LL FIND TO STOP THIS SWARMING . ” — Page 29 .— It is not to be done by monster hives , or ventilation , or by adding supers . If the Bees will swarm , they will . They are a stiff-necked generation , and know their own business , at least they think so , better than we men can teach it them . Our objects , however , are slightly different . Their 's to propagate and preserve their species : ours to secure the maximum amount of honey in any given locality . I have known a swarm sent forth from a Ruche a l'air libre , a French Hive , which I worked in New Zealand . The Combs and Bees were entirely exposed to the external air , which was not then particularly warm . But a swarm was ready to go , so off they went . For full particulars of this remarkable instance see “ My Bee Book , ” second edition . To regulate , not to prevent swarming should be the Bee-master 's aim . More of this hereafter . I here give , by the kindness of Mr. Alfred Neighbour , illustrations of the sort of hive by which alone this can be accomplished , viz ., the Bar Frame hive . Originally of German invention , it , with various modifications , has been widely adopted both on the Continent and in America ; and every Bee-master in England who claims the title of scientific , would do well to supply himself at once . Each honey comb , it will be seen , is built in a separate bar frame like a picture . They are ranged to the number of 9 , 11 , or 13 , in a strong box , and each is both moveable and interchangeable with those of any other hive . Swarming may be checked in any particular stock by cutting out the Queen Cells . The great production of drones can be regulated by limiting the amount of drone cell in any hive , and altogether prevented by removing it all from a stock hive , about the purity of whose strain there is the least doubt ; whilst again , it may be encouraged in a pure blooded stock hive , by inserting at the proper time an additional bar containing drone comb . Any man handy with tools may make them for himself at the cost of the materials , and they will last a lifetime . I can supply my friends with as many as they require at half a guinea , for which they pay double or treble in the shops ; whilst those who think nothing can be good except it is high-priced , and do not like the trouble of making their own hives , may go to any cost they like . The preceding woodcut represents a hive on this principle , but with certain modifications , which may be obtained of Mr. Neighbour , 149 , Regent-street , and will suit the class of Bee keepers last mentioned . Mr. Neighbour has , I may mention , made arrangements for supplying Ligurian Queens of the greatest purity .</p>

    <p>Melissologia ] tells the story of his maid-servant being so covered in a manner very quaint and charming . Perfect quiet under these circumstances is essential to , and will secure , safety ; whilst any thing which can enrage 20 , 000 soldiers , armed with a poisoned dart , may lead to fatal results . Since I wrote the above , a story has appeared in the newspapers , and is , I fear a true one , as names , dates and places are given , of a sting having been fatal to a lady accustomed to the management of bees . Any person who has this idiosyncrasy had better give bees a wide berth . “ I DESKIVER . ” — Page 44 .— There was evidently a taste of Milesian blood in this learned doctor . ‘ Tis fortunate that it was so , for “ discover ” and “ liver ” would not rhyme . “ BREKEKEKEX , COAX , COAX , “ COAX , COAX , BREKEKEKEX . ” — Page 46 . Is the refrain of the well-known chorus in the Frogs of Aristophanes . Any one with an accurate ear , who has been so happy as to assist at a chorus of Bull Frogs in full song in the sweet spring tide , sacred to love and melody , must have felt how accurately the great Comic Poet noted down their song . I do not believe that in the two thousand years which have elapsed since that time there has been a single note altered in their love ditty . I have never been in Greece , and so cannot testify to the musical powers of the Frogs of Boeotia ; but I have had that pleasure both in Spain and in the neighbourhood of Constantinople : in both instances under very favourable circumstances , which I will relate . In June , 1855 , during the Crimean war , I was at Constantinople , the guest of Lord Napier , then Chief Secretary to the British Embassy in that city . He was residing at that lovely place , Therapia , the summer retreat of our Ambassador and his suite . I had pitched my little tent in a grass meadow , close to Lord Napier 's snug house . His hospitality by day was unbounded , but straitened as he was for room by night , he was not sorry to entertain a guest who delighted in camping out , and brought with him the means of doing so . Not fifty yards from my tent was a dark stagnant pool , overshadowed by trees , and every night and all night long the Bull frogs , from their reedy habitations , sang “ Brekekekex , Coax , Coax , ” whilst above the water , and in and out of the dark shadows of the trees , the fire flies flickered about in their ever varying gambols . It was as though Taglioni , resplendent with Jewels , had been dancing her very best to the strains of a Scotch bag-pipe . Again , I was in the noble town of Seville at Easter , 1867 , twelve years later , during which time I had been hard at work in England , and “ no holiday had seen , ” so by that time I needed one . Not a hundred yards from the glorious Cathedral , behind the Alcazar , the old Palace of the Moors , is a large orange garden , and in the midst of it a square tank , of Moorish work , used for irrigation . The garden was tenanted by a widow woman who owned a dozen or so magnificent stall-fed milch cows , and thither I resorted early every morning , after visiting the Cathedral , for the sake of a glass of new milk , and a lesson in Spanish from her two little daughters aged respectively nine and ten , Incarnacion ( the last c pronounced th ) and Salud . Commend me to two chattering little girls , when their shyness has once worn off , as the best teachers of a new language . One glorious morning I was sitting on the edge of the aforesaid tank , inhaling the delicious perfume of the orange blossoms , when a Frog struck up his “ Brekekekex , Coax Coax ” from the still water , and at the same time the air was resonant with the sweet song of the Nightingale . I pride myself on knowing somewhat of the languages of Birds , Beasts , and ( Fishes ? No ! they are mutum pecus , but let us say ) Bull Frogs so I listened attentively , and found the Nightingale and Bull Frog , were each of them serenading his own wife , arboreal , and aquatic . Each wife thought her husband the very best singer in the world : that not a note of his song could be altered for the better ; and both Nightingale and Bull Frog thought the other singer a bore . I noted down the whole of this musical contest at the time . It is quite in the way of one of Virgil 's Amoeboean Bucolics . Not Corydon and Thyrsis , but Batrachos and Philomela were contending for the prize . It is too long to insert here , but may be had of my publishers , under the title of “ Bull Frog and Nightingale ; ” an Apologue , price 6d . But the sum of the whole matter is this : I do not believe , “ pace Darwinii nostri dicatur , ” that natural selection , and conjugal preference has had the effect of altering or improving the Nightingale 's song in the last two thousand years . It could not be louder or better , and I trust may last my time unchanged , whilst on the evidence of Aristophanes ’ chorus we know that Bull Frogs , then , as now , sang “ Brekekekex , Coax , Coax , ” and that song only . THE HONEY POT .— Page 47-52 .— This Fytte , comical as it is in itself , is particularly valuable as instructing the untravelled Britisher in the peculiarities of a German bedstead ; far too short for all who have not by some Procrustoean process been reduced to the normal height of five feet , no inches ! the upper sheet sown to the coverlid , with no possibility of tucking it in , and liable to fall off the sleeper altogether . No blankets , but a mountain of feather-bed piled above , which either stifles you in summer , or rolling off , leaves you to freeze in the winter . Yet in such a bed as this what wonderful positions Mr. Dull managed to assume under the influence of fear . Imitate him , my gentle reader , if you are still young and active , and then you will appreciate his contortions . “ A HONEY THIEF , ILL MAY HE THRIVE . ” — Page 55 .— Every Bee keeper will echo this wish . I know no sight more piteous than an apiary the night after it has been plundered . Light Hives upset , and lying , with the combs all broken , on the ground . The Bees crawling about in wild confusion around their violated homes , lately so neat , and now the very picture of desolation . In vain they attempt to repair the damage which the spoiler 's hand has created ; whilst the stands where the heavy stocks stood the evening before , are one and all tenantless . Many devices to protect Hives from robbers have been tried . Wooden boxes are tightly screwed to the bottom board from below , whilst the bottom board itself is strongly bolted to the stand . This will indeed protect a hive from anything but a powerful crow bar . But the remedy is worse than the disease , as it prevents your ever changing or cleaning the bottom board , and is , in many ways , inconvenient . The best preservative I can think of is to have a savage dog , savage to all but his master , with a strong chain , not fastened to his kennel , but ending in an iron ring , which can slide along a small pole placed horizontally about a foot from the ground in front of the Hives . I have seen this mode of defence adopted in Germany for the protection of the valuable Leech ponds , which are there fattened for the market . It answers for the defence of Leeches , and if so , why not for Bees . “ MANY A NOSE , UPTURNED , WAS SNORING IN REPOSE . ” — Page 66 .— My readers will doubtless remember , as I confess to have done when penning the above line , the opening of Southey 's Thalaba , and the inimitable parody thereof in the Rejected Addresses . When a thing has been done excellently well , it is folly to again attempt the same with a certainty of failure before our eyes . We verse makers do not steal from each other ; we are all one brotherhood , and Corbies nae pike out corbies e'en . But we convey — conveys the word , says glorious Will . “ AND BETWEEN THEM BORE , “ THE FELON TO THE PRISON DOOR . ” — Page 66 . This mode of removing a captive would have suited that extinct species of our protective force , that of the Dogberry and Verges order , and may be recommended to our new police as more merciful , and less grating to the feelings of a prisoner than the present mode of “ running a man in ; ” especially as they generally get hold of the wrong person . A police sedan would enable the innocent captive to conceal his features from the tail of little boys and idle quidnuncs , specially if he were carried like our honey thief head downwards . The last Chapter is like the first , written in the style of the Butterfly 's Ball and the Grasshopper 's feast , and is , it seems to me , no less admirable . If I pride myself on anything in this translation it is on the concluding lines : “ The evening star went flicker — flick — Over the bedroom candlestick ; And round its silver radiance shed To light the sleepy moon to bed . ” “ I 'VE DONE I DOFF MY RIDING GEAR , “ AND ORDER PEGASUS — HIS BEER . ” — Page 72 . Baierische Bier is infinitely superior to any Hippocrene . But no drink in the world can hold a candle to genuine “ Wienische Bier , ” as it comes cool drawn from the cellar . The Romans knew not beer , and so had to put up with “ Falernian , ” or even the “ vile Coecubum . ” I say put up , for the wine that now goes by the name of Falernian is detestable . I suppose , however , that two thousand years ago it was far more carefully made , as I trust it may again be in “ Italia Unita . ” The Romans , knew not beer , but the Greeks had tasted it , though brewed by the hands of barbarians . In Xenophon 's Retreat of the Ten Thousand we are told that they came upon a race of people from whom they got [ Greek : Hek krithon methu . ] Let us then leave Pegasus to enjoy his drink of barley wine , though like Baron Munchausen 's famous steed , he hath not the wherewithal to stow away his beer . My dear old Peggy , alluded to in the first of this series of notes , and therefore the fittest subject for a wind up , was , when hard worked , very fond of a quart of good ale , with half a quartern loaf broken into it ; she would drink up the ale at a draught , then quickly munch the sop , and start with fresh vigour for another ten-mile trot . CORRIGENDA . The reader is asked to excuse the following errors , excusable — as for the sake of having its original wood blocks , the work , with the exception of the notes , was printed abroad .
