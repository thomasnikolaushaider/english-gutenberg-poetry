      <head>PHAETHON</head>
      <head>ATTEMPTED IN THE GALLIAMBIC MEASURE</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">At the coming up of Phoebus the all-luminous charioteer ,</l>
       <l n="2">Double-visaged stand the mountains in imperial multitudes ,</l>
       <l n="3">And with shadows dappled men sing to him , Hail , O Beneficent !</l>
       <l n="4">For they shudder chill , the earth-vales , at his clouding , shudder to black ;</l>
       <l n="5">In the light of him there is music thro ’ the poplar and river-sedge ,</l>
       <l n="6">Renovation , chirp of brooks , hum of the forest — an ocean-song .</l>
       <l n="7">Never pearl from ocean-bottoms by the diver exultingly ,</l>
       <l n="8">In his breathlessness , above thrust , is as earth to Helios .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="9">Who usurps his place there , rashest ? Aphrodite 's loved one it is !</l>
       <l n="10">To his son the flaming Sun-God , to the tender youth , Phaethon ,</l>
       <l n="11">Rule of day this day surrenders as a thing hereditary ,</l>
       <l n="12">Having sworn by Styx tremendous , for the proof of his parentage ,</l>
       <l n="13">He would grant his son 's petition , whatsoever the sign thereof .</l>
       <l n="14">Then , rejoiced , the stripling answered : ‘ Rule of day give me ; give it me ,</l>
       <l n="15">‘ Give me place that men may see me how I blaze , and transcendingly ,</l>
       <l n="16">‘ I , divine , proclaim my birthright . ’ Darkened Helios , his utterance</l>
       <l n="17">Choked prophetic : ‘ O half mortal ! ’ he exclaimed in an agony ,</l>
       <l n="18">‘ O lost son of mine ! lost son ! No ! put a prayer for another thing :</l>
       <l n="19">‘ Not for this : insane to wish it , and to crave the gift impious !</l>
       <l n="20">‘ Cannot other gifts my godhead shed upon thee ? miraculous</l>
       <l n="21">‘ Mighty gifts to prove a blessing , that to earth thou shalt be a joy ?</l>
       <l n="22">‘ Gifts of healing , wherewith men walk as the Gods beneficently ;</l>
       <l n="23">‘ As a God to sway to concord hearts of men , reconciling them ;</l>
       <l n="24">‘ Gifts of verse , the lyre , the laurel , therewithal that thine origin</l>
       <l n="25">‘ Shall be known even as when I strike on the string 'd shell with melody ,</l>
       <l n="26">‘ And the golden notes , like medicine , darting straight to the cavities ,</l>
       <l n="27">‘ Fill them up , till hearts of men bound as the billows , the ships thereon . ’</l>
       <l n="28">Thus intently urged the Sun-God ; but the force of his eloquence</l>
       <l n="29">Was the pressing on of sea-waves scattered broad from the rocks away .</l>
       <l n="30">What shall move a soul from madness ? Lost , lost in delirium ,</l>
       <l n="31">Rock-fast , the adolescent to his father , irreverent ,</l>
       <l n="32">‘ By the oath ! the oath ! thine oath ! ’ cried . The effulgent foreseer then ,</l>
       <l n="33">Quivering in his loins parental , on the boy 's beaming countenance</l>
       <l n="34">Looked and moaned , and urged him for love 's sake , for sweet life 's sake , to yield the claim ,</l>
       <l n="35">To abandon his mad hunger , and avert the calamity .</l>
       <l n="36">But he , vehement , passionate , called out : ‘ Let me show I am what I say ,</l>
       <l n="37">‘ That the taunts I hear be silenced : I am stung with their whispering .</l>
       <l n="38">‘ Only , Thou , my Father , Thou tell how aloft the revolving wheels ,</l>
       <l n="39">‘ How aloft the cleaving horse-crests I may guide peremptorily ,</l>
       <l n="40">‘ Till I drink the shadows , fire-hot , like a flower celestial ,</l>
       <l n="41">‘ And my fellows see me curbing the fierce steeds , the dear dew-drinkers :</l>
       <l n="42">‘ Yea , for this I gaze on life 's light ; throw for this any sacrifice . ’</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="43">All the end foreseeing , Phoebus , to his oath irrevocable ,</l>
       <l n="44">Bowed obedient , deploring the insanity pitiless .</l>
       <l n="45">Then the flame-outsnorting horses were led forth : it was so decreed .</l>
       <l n="46">They were yoked before the glad youth by his sister-ancillaries .</l>
       <l n="47">Swift the ripple ripples follow 'd , as of aureate Helicon ,</l>
       <l n="48">Down their flanks , while they impatient pawed desire of the distances ,</l>
       <l n="49">And the bit with fury champed . Oh ! unimaginable glories !</l>
       <l n="50">Unimagined speed and splendour in the circle of upper air !</l>
       <l n="51">Higher , higher than the mountains , than the eagle fleeing arrows !</l>
       <l n="52">Glory grander than the armed host upon earth singing victory !</l>
       <l n="53">Chafed the youth with their spirit surcharged , as when blossom is shaken by winds ,</l>
       <l n="54">Marked that labour by his sister Phaethontiades finished , quick</l>
       <l n="55">On the slope of the car his forefoot set assured : and the morning rose :</l>
       <l n="56">Seeing whom , and what a day dawned , stood the God , as in harvest fields ,</l>
       <l n="57">When the reaper grasps the full sheaf and the sickle that severs it :</l>
       <l n="58">Hugged the withered head with one hand , with the other , to indicate</l>
       <l n="59">( If this woe might be averted , this immeasurable evil ) ,</l>
       <l n="60">Laid the kindling course in view , told how the reins to manipulate :</l>
       <l n="61">Named the horses fondly , fearful , caution 'd urgently betweenwhiles :</l>
       <l n="62">Their diverging tempers dwelt on , and their wantonness , wickedness ,</l>
       <l n="63">That the voice of Gods alone held in restraint ; but the voice of Gods ;</l>
       <l n="64">None but Gods can curb . He spake : vain were the words : scarcely listening ,</l>
       <l n="65">Mounted Phaethon , swinging reins loose , and , ‘ Behold me , companions ,</l>
       <l n="66">‘ It is I here , I ! ’ he shouted , glancing down with supremacy ;</l>
       <l n="67">‘ Not to any of you was this gift granted ever in annals of men ;</l>
       <l n="68">‘ I alone what only Gods can , I alone am governing day ! ’</l>
       <l n="69">Short the triumph , brief his rapture : see a hurricane suddenly</l>
       <l n="70">Beat the lifting billow crestless , roll it broken this way and that ;—</l>
       <l n="71">At the leap on yielding ether , in despite of his reprimand ,</l>
       <l n="72">Swayed tumultuous the fire-steeds , plunging reckless hither and yon ;</l>
       <l n="73">Unto men a great amazement , all agaze at the Orient :—</l>
       <l n="74">Pitifully for mastery striving in ascension , the charioteer ,</l>
       <l n="75">Reminiscent , drifts of counsel caught confused in his arid wits ;</l>
       <l n="76">The reins stiff ahind his shoulder madly pulled for the mastery ,</l>
       <l n="77">Till a thunder off the tense chords thro ’ his ears dinned horrible .</l>
       <l n="78">Panic seized him : fled his vision of inviolability ;</l>
       <l n="79">Fled the dream that he of mortals rode mischances predominant ;</l>
       <l n="80">And he cried , ‘ Had I petitioned for a cup of chill aconite ,</l>
       <l n="81">‘ My descent to awful Hades had been soft , for now must I go</l>
       <l n="82">‘ With the curse by father Zeus cast on ambition immoderate .</l>
       <l n="83">‘ Oh , my sisters ! Thou , my Goddess , in whose love I was enviable ,</l>
       <l n="84">‘ From whose arms I rushed befrenzied , what a wreck will this body be ,</l>
       <l n="85">‘ That admired of thee stood rose-warm in the courts where thy mysteries</l>
       <l n="86">‘ Celebration had from me , me the most splendidly privileged !</l>
       <l n="87">‘ Never more shall I thy temple fill with incenses bewildering ;</l>
       <l n="88">‘ Not again hear thy half-murmurs — I am lost !— never , never more .</l>
       <l n="89">‘ I am wrecked on seas of air , hurled to my death in a vessel of flame !</l>
       <l n="90">‘ Hither , sisters ! Father , save me ! Hither , succour me , Cypria ! ’</l>

       <l n="91">Now a wail of men to Zeus rang : from Olympus the Thunderer</l>
       <l n="92">Saw the rage of the havoc wide-mouthed , the bright car superimpending</l>
       <l n="93">Over Asia , Africa , low down ; ruin flaming over the vales ;</l>
       <l n="94">Light disastrous rising savage out of smoke inveterately ;</l>
       <l n="95">Beast-black , the conflagration like a menacing shadow move</l>
       <l n="96">With voracious roaring southward , where aslant , insufferable ,</l>
       <l n="97">The bright steeds careered their parched way down an arc of the firmament .</l>
       <l n="98">For the day grew like to thick night , and the orb was its beacon-fire ,</l>

       <l n="108">Like the paling of the dawn-star withers visibly , he aloft :</l>
       <l n="109">Bitter fury in his aspect , bitter death in the heart of him .</l>
       <l n="110">Crouch the herds , contract the reptiles , crouch the lions under their paws .</l>
       <l n="111">White as metal in the furnace are the faces of humankind :</l>

    <p n="1">THEODOLINDA .</p>
    <p n="2">The legend of the Iron Crown of Lombardy , formed of a nail of the true Cross by order of the devout Queen Theodolinda , is well known . In the above dramatic song she is seen passing through one of the higher temptations of the believing Christian .</p>

    <p n="4">The Galliambic Measure .</p>
    <p n="5">Hermann ( Elementa Doctrinae Metricae ) , after citing lines from the Tragic poet Phrynichus and from the Comic , observes :</p>
    <p n="6">Dixi supra , Phrynichorum versus videri puros Ionicos esse . Id si verum est , Galliambi non alia re ab his differunt , quam quod anaclasin , contractionesque et solutiones recipiunt . Itaque versus Galliambicus ex duobus versibus Anacreonteis constat , quorum secundus catalecticus est , hac forma :</p>

    <p>Mihi januae frequentes , mihi limina tepida : With stress on the emotion : Jam , jam dolet quod egi , jam jamque poenitet . A perfect conquest of the measure is not possible in our tongue . For the sake of an occasional success in the velocity , sweep , volume of the line , it seems worth an effort ; and , if to some degree serviceable for narrative verse , it is one of the exercises of a writer which readers may be invited to share .</p>
