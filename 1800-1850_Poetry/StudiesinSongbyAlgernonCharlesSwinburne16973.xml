     <l n="1">Daughter in spirit elect and consecrate</l>
     <l n="2">By love and reverence of the Olympian sire</l>

     <l n="4">And found so gracious toward my long desire</l>
     <l n="5">To bid that love in song before his gate</l>
     <l n="6">Sound , and my lute be loyal to his lyre ,</l>
     <l n="7">To none save one it now may dedicate</l>
     <l n="8">Song 's new burnt-offering on a century 's pyre .</l>
     <l n="9">And though the gift be light</l>
     <l n="10">As ashes in men 's sight ,</l>
     <l n="11">Left by the flame of no ethereal fire ,</l>
     <l n="12">Yet , for his worthier sake</l>
     <l n="13">Than words are worthless , take</l>
     <l n="14">This wreath of words ere yet their hour expire :</l>
     <l n="15">So , haply , from some heaven above ,</l>
     <l n="16">He , seeing , may set next yours my sacrifice of love .</l>

     <l n="2">Five years beyond an hundred years have seen</l>
     <l n="3">Their winters , white as faith 's and age 's hue ,</l>
     <l n="4">Melt , smiling through brief tears that broke between ,</l>
     <l n="5">And hope 's young conquering colours reared anew ,</l>
     <l n="6">Since , on the day whose edge for kings made keen</l>
     <l n="7">Smote sharper once than ever storm-wind blew ,</l>
     <l n="8">A head predestined for the girdling green</l>
     <l n="9">That laughs at lightning all the seasons through ,</l>
     <l n="10">Nor frost or change can sunder</l>
     <l n="11">Its crown untouched of thunder</l>
     <l n="12">Leaf from least leaf of all its leaves that grew</l>
     <l n="13">Alone for brows too bold</l>
     <l n="14">For storm to sear of old ,</l>
     <l n="15">Elect to shine in time 's eternal view ,</l>
     <l n="16">Rose on the verge of radiant life</l>
     <l n="17">Between the winds and sunbeams mingling love with strife .</l>

     <l n="19">The darkling day that gave its bloodred birth</l>
     <l n="20">To Milton 's white republic undefiled</l>
     <l n="21">That might endure so few fleet years on earth</l>
     <l n="22">Bore in him likewise as divine a child ;</l>
     <l n="23">But born not less for crowns of love and mirth ,</l>
     <l n="24">Of palm and myrtle passionate and mild ,</l>
     <l n="25">The leaf that girds about with gentler girth</l>
     <l n="26">The brow steel-bound in battle , and the wild</l>
     <l n="27">Soft spray that flowers above</l>
     <l n="28">The flower-soft hair of love ;</l>
     <l n="29">And the white lips of wayworn winter smiled</l>
     <l n="30">And grew serene as spring 's</l>
     <l n="31">When with stretched clouds like wings</l>
     <l n="32">Or wings like drift of snow-clouds massed and piled</l>
     <l n="33">The godlike giant , softening , spread</l>
     <l n="34">A shadow of stormy shelter round the new-born head .</l>

     <l n="36">And o'er it brightening bowed the wild-haired hour ,</l>
     <l n="37">And touched his tongue with honey and with fire ,</l>
     <l n="38">And breathed between his lips the note of power</l>
     <l n="39">That makes of all the winds of heaven a lyre</l>
     <l n="40">Whose strings are stretched from topmost peaks that tower</l>
     <l n="41">To softest springs of waters that suspire ,</l>
     <l n="42">With sounds too dim to shake the lowliest flower</l>
     <l n="43">Breathless with hope and dauntless with desire :</l>
     <l n="44">And bright before his face</l>
     <l n="45">That Hour became a Grace ,</l>
     <l n="46">As in the light of their Athenian quire</l>
     <l n="47">When the Hours before the sun</l>
     <l n="48">And Graces were made one ,</l>
     <l n="49">Called by sweet Love down from the aerial gyre</l>
     <l n="50">By one dear name of natural joy ,</l>
     <l n="51">To bear on her bright breast from heaven a heaven-born boy .</l>

     <l n="53">Ere light could kiss the little lids in sunder</l>
     <l n="54">Or love could lift them for the sun to smite ,</l>
     <l n="55">His fiery birth-star as a sign of wonder</l>
     <l n="56">Had risen , perplexing the presageful night</l>
     <l n="57">With shadow and glory around her sphere and under</l>
     <l n="58">And portents prophesying by sound and sight ;</l>
     <l n="59">And half the sound was song and half was thunder ,</l>
     <l n="60">And half his life of lightning , half of light :</l>
     <l n="61">And in the soft clenched hand</l>
     <l n="62">Shone like a burning brand</l>
     <l n="63">A shadowy sword for swordless fields of fight ,</l>
     <l n="64">Wrought only for such lord</l>
     <l n="65">As so may wield the sword</l>
     <l n="66">That all things ill be put to fear and flight</l>
     <l n="67">Even at the flash and sweep and gleam</l>
     <l n="68">Of one swift stroke beheld but in a shuddering dream .</l>

     <l n="70">Like the sun 's rays that blind the night 's wild beasts</l>
     <l n="71">The sword of song shines as the swordsman sings ;</l>
     <l n="72">From the west wind 's verge even to the arduous east 's</l>
     <l n="73">The splendour of the shadow that it flings</l>
     <l n="74">Makes fire and storm in heaven above the feasts</l>
     <l n="75">Of men fulfilled with food of evil things ;</l>
     <l n="76">Strikes dumb the lying and hungering lips of priests ,</l>
     <l n="77">Smites dead the slaying and ravening hands of kings ;</l>
     <l n="78">Turns dark the lamp 's hot light ,</l>
     <l n="79">And turns the darkness bright</l>
     <l n="80">As with the shadow of dawn 's reverberate wings ;</l>
     <l n="81">And far before its way</l>
     <l n="82">Heaven , yearning toward the day ,</l>
     <l n="83">Shines with its thunder and round its lightning rings ;</l>
     <l n="84">And never hand yet earlier played</l>
     <l n="85">With that keen sword whose hilt is cloud , and fire its blade .</l>

     <l n="87">As dropping flakes of honey-heavy dew</l>
     <l n="88">More soft than slumber 's , fell the first note 's sound</l>
     <l n="89">From strings the swift young hand strayed lightlier through</l>
     <l n="90">Than leaves through calm air wheeling toward the ground</l>
     <l n="91">Stray down the drifting wind when skies are blue</l>
     <l n="92">Nor yet the wings of latter winds unbound ,</l>
     <l n="93">Ere winter loosen all the Æolian crew</l>
     <l n="94">With storm unleashed behind them like a hound .</l>
     <l n="95">As lightly rose and sank</l>
     <l n="96">Beside a green-flowered bank</l>
     <l n="97">The clear first notes his burning boyhood found</l>
     <l n="98">To sing her sacred praise</l>
     <l n="99">Who rode her city 's ways</l>
     <l n="100">Clothed with bright hair and with high purpose crowned ;</l>
     <l n="101">A song of soft presageful breath ,</l>
     <l n="102">Prefiguring all his love and faith in life and death ;</l>

     <l n="104">Who should love two things only and only praise</l>
     <l n="105">More than all else for ever : even the glory</l>
     <l n="106">Of goodly beauty in women , whence all days</l>
     <l n="107">Take light whereby death 's self seems transitory ;</l>
     <l n="108">And loftier love than loveliest eyes can raise ,</l>
     <l n="109">Love that wipes off the miry stains and gory</l>
     <l n="110">From Time 's worn feet , besmirched on bloodred ways ,</l>
     <l n="111">And lightens with his light the night of story ;</l>
     <l n="112">Love that lifts up from dust</l>
     <l n="113">Life , and makes darkness just ,</l>
     <l n="114">And purges as with fire of purgatory</l>
     <l n="115">The dense disastrous air ,</l>
     <l n="116">To burn old falsehood bare</l>
     <l n="117">And give the wind its ashes heaped and hoary ;</l>
     <l n="118">Love , that with eyes of ageless youth</l>
     <l n="119">Sees on the breast of Freedom borne her nursling Truth .</l>

     <l n="124">And Song , whose fires are quenched when Freedom 's are .</l>
     <l n="125">Of all that love not liberty let none</l>
     <l n="126">Love her that fills our lips with fire from far</l>
     <l n="127">To mix with winds and seas in unison</l>
     <l n="128">And sound athwart life 's tideless harbour-bar</l>
     <l n="129">Out where our songs fly free</l>
     <l n="130">Across time 's bounded sea ,</l>
     <l n="131">A boundless flight beyond the dim sun 's car ,</l>
     <l n="132">Till all the spheres of night</l>
     <l n="133">Chime concord round their flight</l>
     <l n="134">Too loud for blasts of warring change to mar ,</l>

   <p>‘ J'en passe , et des meilleurs . ’ But who can enumerate all or half our obligations to the illimitable and inexhaustible genius of the great man whose life and whose labour lasted even from the generation of our fathers ’ fathers to our own ? Hardly any reader can feel , I think , so deeply as I feel the inadequacy of my poor praise and too imperfect gratitude to the majestic subject of their attempted expression ; but ‘ such as I had have I given him . ’</p>
   <p>GRAND CHORUS OF BIRDS</p>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>FROM</head>
    <head>ARISTOPHANES</head>
     <l n="1">Attempted in English verse after the original metre .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>I was allured into the audacity of this experiment by consideration of a fact which hitherto does not seem to have been taken into consideration by any translator of the half divine humourist in whose incomparable genius the highest qualities of Rabelais were fused and harmonized with the supremest gifts of Shelley : namely , that his marvellous metrical invention of the anapæstic heptameter was almost exactly reproducible in a language to which all variations and combinations of anapæstic , iambic , or trochaic metre are as natural and pliable as all dactylic and spondaic forms of verse are unnatural and abhorrent . As it happens , this highest central interlude of a most adorable masterpiece is as easy to detach from its dramatic setting , and even from its lyrical context , as it was easy to give line for line of it in English . In two metrical points only does my version vary from the verbal pattern of the original . I have of course added rhymes , and double rhymes , as necessary makeweights for the imperfection of an otherwise inadequate language ; and equally of course I have not attempted the impossible and undesirable task of reproducing the rare exceptional effect of a line overcharged on purpose with a preponderance of heavy-footed spondees : and this for the obvious reason that even if such a line — which I doubt — could be exactly represented , foot by foot and pause for pause , in English , this English line would no more be a verse in any proper sense of the word than is the line I am writing at this moment . And my main intention , or at least my main desire , in the undertaking of this brief adventure , was to renew as far as possible for English ears the music of this resonant and triumphant metre , which goes ringing at full gallop as of horses who</p>
   <p>‘ dance as ‘ twere to the music Their own hoofs make . ’</p>
   <p>I would not seem over curious in search of an apt or inapt quotation : but nothing can be fitter than a verse of Shakespeare 's to praise at once and to describe the most typical verse of Aristophanes .</p>

     <l n="53">slumber ;</l>

    <head>EVENING ON THE BROADS .</head>
     <l n="1">Over two shadowless waters , adrift as a pinnace in peril ,</l>
     <l n="2">Hangs as in heavy suspense , charged with irresolute light ,</l>
     <l n="3">Softly the soul of the sunset upholden awhile on the sterile</l>
     <l n="4">Waves and wastes of the land , half repossessed by the night .</l>
     <l n="5">Inland glimmer the shallows asleep and afar in the breathless</l>
     <l n="6">Twilight : yonder the depths darken afar and asleep .</l>
     <l n="7">Slowly the semblance of death out of heaven descends on the deathless</l>
     <l n="8">Waters : hardly the light lives on the face of the deep —</l>
     <l n="9">Hardly , but here for awhile . All over the grey soft shallow</l>
     <l n="10">Hover the colours and clouds of the twilight , void of a star .</l>
     <l n="11">As a bird unfledged is the broad-winged night , whose winglets are callow</l>
     <l n="12">Yet , but soon with their plumes will she cover her brood from afar ,</l>
     <l n="13">Cover the brood of her worlds that cumber the skies with their blossom</l>
     <l n="14">Thick as the darkness of leaf-shadowed spring is encumbered with flowers .</l>
     <l n="15">World upon world is enwound in the bountiful girth of her bosom ,</l>
     <l n="16">Warm and lustrous with life lovely to look on as ours .</l>
     <l n="17">Still is the sunset adrift as a spirit in doubt that dissembles</l>
     <l n="18">Still with itself , being sick of division and dimmed by dismay —</l>
     <l n="19">Nay , not so ; but with love and delight beyond passion it trembles ,</l>
     <l n="20">Fearful and fain of the night , lovely with love of the day :</l>
     <l n="21">Fain and fearful of rest that is like unto death , and begotten</l>
     <l n="22">Out of the womb of the tomb , born of the seed of the grave :</l>
     <l n="23">Lovely with shadows of loves that are only not wholly forgotten ,</l>
     <l n="24">Only not wholly suppressed by the dark as a wreck by the wave .</l>
     <l n="25">Still there linger the loves of the morning and noon , in a vision</l>
     <l n="26">Blindly beheld , but in vain : ghosts that are tired , and would rest .</l>
     <l n="27">But the glories beloved of the night rise all too dense for division ,</l>
     <l n="28">Deep in the depth of her breast sheltered as doves in a nest .</l>
     <l n="29">Fainter the beams of the loves of the daylight season enkindled</l>
     <l n="30">Wane , and the memories of hours that were fair with the love of them</l>
     <l n="31">fade :</l>
     <l n="32">Loftier , aloft of the lights of the sunset stricken and dwindled ,</l>
     <l n="33">Gather the signs of the love at the heart of the night new-made .</l>
     <l n="34">New-made night , new-born of the sunset , immeasurable , endless ,</l>
     <l n="35">Opens the secret of love hid from of old in her heart ,</l>
     <l n="36">In the deep sweet heart full-charged with faultless love of the friendless</l>
     <l n="37">Spirits of men that are eased when the wheels of the sun depart .</l>
     <l n="38">Still is the sunset afloat as a ship on the waters upholden</l>
     <l n="39">Full-sailed , wide-winged , poised softly for ever asway —</l>
     <l n="40">Nay , not so , but at least for a little , awhile at the golden</l>
     <l n="41">Limit of arching air fain for an hour to delay .</l>
     <l n="42">Here on the bar of the sand-bank , steep yet aslope to the gleaming</l>
     <l n="43">Waste of the water without , waste of the water within ,</l>
     <l n="44">Lights overhead and lights underneath seem doubtfully dreaming</l>
     <l n="45">Whether the day be done , whether the night may begin .</l>
     <l n="46">Far and afar and farther again they falter and hover ,</l>
     <l n="47">Warm on the water and deep in the sky and pale on the cloud :</l>
     <l n="48">Colder again and slowly remoter , afraid to recover</l>
     <l n="49">Breath , yet fain to revive , as it seems , from the skirt of the shroud .</l>
     <l n="50">Faintly the heartbeats shorten and pause of the light in the westward</l>
     <l n="51">Heaven , as eastward quicken the paces of star upon star</l>
     <l n="52">Hurried and eager of life as a child that strains to the breast-ward</l>
     <l n="53">Eagerly , yearning forth of the deeps where the ways of them are ,</l>
     <l n="54">Glad of the glory of the gift of their life and the wealth of its wonder ,</l>
     <l n="55">Fain of the night and the sea and the sweet wan face of the earth .</l>
     <l n="56">Over them air grows deeper , intense with delight in them : under</l>
     <l n="57">Things are thrilled in their sleep as with sense of a sure new birth .</l>
     <l n="58">But here by the sand-bank watching , with eyes on the sea-line , stranger</l>
     <l n="59">Grows to me also the weight of the sea-ridge gazed on of me ,</l>
     <l n="60">Heavily heaped up , changefully changeless , void though of danger</l>
     <l n="61">Void not of menace , but full of the might of the dense dull sea .</l>
     <l n="62">Like as the wave is before me , behind is the bank deep-drifted ;</l>
     <l n="63">Yellow and thick as the bank is behind me in front is the wave .</l>
     <l n="64">As the wall of a prison imprisoning the mere is the girth of it lifted :</l>
     <l n="65">But the rampire of water in front is erect as the wall of a grave .</l>
     <l n="66">And the crests of it crumble and topple and change , but the wall is not</l>
     <l n="67">broken :</l>
     <l n="68">Standing still dry-shod , I see it as higher than my head ,</l>
     <l n="69">Moving inland alway again , reared up as in token</l>
     <l n="70">Still of impending wrath still in the foam of it shed .</l>
     <l n="71">And even in the pauses between them , dividing the rollers in sunder ,</l>
     <l n="72">High overhead seems ever the sea-line fixed as a mark ,</l>
     <l n="73">And the shore where I stand as a valley beholden of hills whence thunder</l>
     <l n="74">Cloud and torrent and storm , darkening the depths of the dark .</l>
     <l n="75">Up to the sea , not upon it or over it , upward from under</l>
     <l n="76">Seems he to gaze , whose eyes yearn after it here from the shore :</l>
     <l n="77">A wall of turbid water , aslope to the wide sky 's wonder</l>
     <l n="78">Of colour and cloud , it climbs , or spreads as a slanted floor .</l>
     <l n="79">And the large lights change on the face of the mere like things that were</l>
     <l n="80">living ,</l>
     <l n="81">Winged and wonderful , beams like as birds are that pass and are free :</l>
     <l n="82">But the light is dense as darkness , a gift withheld in the giving ,</l>
     <l n="83">That lies as dead on the fierce dull face of the landward sea .</l>
     <l n="84">Stained and stifled and soiled , made earthier than earth is and duller ,</l>
     <l n="85">Grimly she puts back light as rejected , a thing put away :</l>
     <l n="86">No transparent rapture , a molten music of colour ;</l>
     <l n="87">No translucent love taken and given of the day .</l>
     <l n="88">Fettered and marred and begrimed is the light 's live self on her falling ,</l>
     <l n="89">As the light of a man 's life lighted the fume of a dungeon mars :</l>
     <l n="90">Only she knows of the wind , when her wrath gives ear to him calling ;</l>
     <l n="91">The delight of the light she knows not , nor answers the sun or the stars .</l>
     <l n="92">Love she hath none to return for the luminous love of their giving :</l>
     <l n="93">None to reflect from the bitter and shallow response of her heart</l>
     <l n="94">Yearly she feeds on her dead , yet herself seems dead and not living ,</l>
     <l n="95">Or confused as a soul heavy-laden with trouble that will not depart .</l>
     <l n="96">In the sound of her speech to the darkness the moan of her evil remorse is ,</l>
     <l n="97">Haply , for strong ships gnawed by the dog-toothed sea-bank 's fang</l>
     <l n="98">And trampled to death by the rage of the feet of her foam-lipped horses</l>
     <l n="99">Whose manes are yellow as plague , and as ensigns of pestilence hang ,</l>
     <l n="100">That wave in the foul faint air of the breath of a death-stricken city ;</l>
     <l n="101">So menacing heaves she the manes of her rollers knotted with sand ,</l>
     <l n="102">Discoloured , opaque , suspended in sign as of strength without pity ,</l>
     <l n="103">That shake with flameless thunder the low long length of the strand .</l>
     <l n="104">Here , far off in the farther extreme of the shore as it lengthens</l>
     <l n="105">Northward , lonely for miles , ere ever a village begin ,</l>
     <l n="106">On the lapsing land that recedes as the growth of the strong sea</l>
     <l n="107">strengthens</l>
     <l n="108">Shoreward , thrusting further and further its outworks in ,</l>
     <l n="109">Here in Shakespeare 's vision , a flower of her kin forsaken ,</l>
     <l n="110">Lay in her golden raiment alone on the wild wave 's edge ,</l>
     <l n="111">Surely by no shore else , but here on the bank storm-shaken ,</l>
     <l n="112">Perdita , bright as a dew-drop engilt of the sun on the sedge .</l>
     <l n="113">Here on a shore unbeheld of his eyes in a dream he beheld her</l>
     <l n="114">Outcast , fair as a fairy , the child of a far-off king :</l>
     <l n="115">And over the babe-flower gently the head of a pastoral elder</l>
     <l n="116">Bowed , compassionate , hoar as the hawthorn-blossom in spring ,</l>
     <l n="117">And kind as harvest in autumn : a shelter of shade on the lonely</l>
     <l n="118">Shelterless unknown shore scourged of implacable waves :</l>
     <l n="119">Here , where the wind walks royal , alone in his kingdom , and only</l>
     <l n="120">Sounds to the sedges a wail as of triumph that conquers and craves .</l>
     <l n="121">All these waters and wastes are his empire of old , and awaken</l>
     <l n="122">From barren and stagnant slumber at only the sound of his breath :</l>
     <l n="123">Yet the hunger is eased not that aches in his heart , nor the goal overtaken</l>
     <l n="124">That his wide wings yearn for and labour as hearts that yearn after</l>
     <l n="125">death .</l>
     <l n="126">All the solitude sighs and expects with a blind expectation</l>
     <l n="127">Somewhat unknown of its own sad heart , grown heart-sick of strife :</l>
     <l n="128">Till sometime its wild heart maddens , and moans , and the vast ululation</l>
     <l n="129">Takes wing with the clouds on the waters , and wails to be quit of its</l>
     <l n="130">life .</l>
     <l n="131">For the spirit and soul of the waste is the wind , and his wings with their</l>
     <l n="132">waving</l>
     <l n="133">Darken and lighten the darkness and light of it thickened or thinned ;</l>
     <l n="134">But the heart that impels them is even as a conqueror 's insatiably craving</l>
     <l n="135">That victory can fill not , as power cannot satiate the want of the wind .</l>
     <l n="136">All these moorlands and marshes are full of his might , and oppose not</l>
     <l n="137">Aught of defence nor of barrier , of forest or precipice piled :</l>
     <l n="138">But the will of the wind works ever as his that desires what he knows not ,</l>
     <l n="139">And the wail of his want unfulfilled is as one making moan for her child .</l>
     <l n="140">And the cry of his triumph is even as the crying of hunger that maddens</l>
     <l n="141">The heart of a strong man aching in vain as the wind 's heart aches</l>
     <l n="142">And the sadness itself of the land for its infinite solitude saddens</l>
     <l n="143">More for the sound than the silence athirst for the sound that slakes .</l>
     <l n="144">And the sunset at last and the twilight are dead : and the darkness is</l>
     <l n="145">breathless</l>
     <l n="146">With fear of the wind 's breath rising that seems and seems not to sleep :</l>
     <l n="147">But a sense of the sound of it alway , a spirit unsleeping and deathless ,</l>
     <l n="148">Ghost or God , evermore moves on the face of the deep .</l>
