     <l n="2">“ Violets ! Violets ! Violets ! ”</l>
     <l n="3">This was the cry I heard</l>
     <l n="4">As I passed through the street of a city ;</l>
     <l n="5">And quickly my heart was stirred</l>
     <l n="6">To an incomprehensible pity ,</l>
     <l n="7">At the undertone of the cry ;</l>
     <l n="8">For it seemed like the voice of one</l>
     <l n="9">Who was stricken , and all undone ,</l>
     <l n="10">Who was only longing to die .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="11">“ Violets ! Violets ! Violets ! ”</l>
     <l n="12">The voice came nearer still .</l>
     <l n="13">“ Surely , ” I said , “ it is May ,</l>
     <l n="14">And out on valley and hill ,</l>
     <l n="15">The violets blooming to-day ,</l>
     <l n="16">Send this invitation to me</l>
     <l n="17">To come and be with them once more ;</l>
     <l n="18">I know they are dear as can be ,</l>
     <l n="19">And I hate the town with its roar . ”</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="20">“ Violets ! Violets ! Violets ! ”</l>
     <l n="21">Children of sun and of dew ,</l>
     <l n="22">Flakes of the blue of the sky ,</l>
     <l n="23">There is somebody calling to you</l>
     <l n="24">Who seems to be longing to die ;</l>
     <l n="25">Yet violets are so sweet</l>
     <l n="26">They can scarcely have dealings with death .</l>
     <l n="27">Can it be , that the dying breath ,</l>
     <l n="28">That comes from the one last beat</l>
     <l n="29">Of a true heart , turns to the flowers ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="30">“ Violets ! Violets ! Violets ! ”</l>
     <l n="31">The crier is near me at last .</l>
     <l n="32">With my eyes I am holding her fast .</l>
     <l n="33">She is a lovely seller of flowers .</l>
     <l n="34">She is one whom the town devours</l>
     <l n="35">In its jaws of bustle and strife .</l>
     <l n="36">How poverty grinds down a life ;</l>
     <l n="37">For , lost in the slime of a city ,</l>
     <l n="38">What is a beautiful face ?</l>
     <l n="39">Few are they who have pity</l>
     <l n="40">For loveliness in disgrace .</l>
     <l n="41">Yet she that I hold with my eyes ,</l>
     <l n="42">Who seems so modest and wise ,</l>
     <l n="43">Has not yet fallen , I am sure .</l>
     <l n="44">She has nobly learned to endure .</l>
     <l n="45">Large , and mournful , and meek ,</l>
     <l n="46">Her eyes seem to drink from my own .</l>
     <l n="47">Her curls are carelessly thrown</l>
     <l n="48">Back from white shoulder and cheek ;</l>
     <l n="49">And her lips seem strawberries , lost</l>
     <l n="50">In some Arctic country of frost .</l>
     <l n="51">The slightest curve on a face ,</l>
     <l n="52">May give an expression unmeet ;</l>
     <l n="53">Yet hers is so perfect and sweet ,</l>
     <l n="54">And shaped with such delicate grace ,</l>
     <l n="55">Its loveliness is complete .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="56">“ Violets ! Violets ! Violets ! ”</l>
     <l n="57">I hear the cry once more ;</l>
     <l n="58">But not as I heard it before .</l>
     <l n="59">It whispers no more of death ;</l>
     <l n="60">But only of odorous breath ,</l>
     <l n="61">And modest flowers , and life .</l>
     <l n="62">I purchased a cluster , so rife</l>
     <l n="63">With the touch of her tapering hand ,</l>
     <l n="64">I seem to hold it in mine .</l>
     <l n="65">I would I could understand ,</l>
     <l n="66">Why a touch seems so divine .</l>

    <head>A FLOWER FOUND IN THE STREET .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">To-day in passing down the street ,</l>
     <l n="2">I found a flower upon the walk ,</l>
     <l n="3">A dear syringa , white and sweet ,</l>
     <l n="4">Wrung idly from the missing stalk .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">And something in its odor speaks</l>
     <l n="6">Of dark brown eyes , and arms of snow ,</l>
     <l n="7">And rainbow smiles on sunset cheeks —</l>
     <l n="8">The maid I saw a month ago .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">I waited for her many a day ,</l>
     <l n="10">On the dear ground where first we met ;</l>
     <l n="11">I sought her up and down the way ,</l>
     <l n="12">And all in vain I seek her yet .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">Syringa , naught your odor tells ,</l>
     <l n="14">Or whispers so I cannot hear ;</l>
     <l n="15">Speak out , and tell me where she dwells ,</l>
     <l n="16">In perfume accents , loud and clear .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="17">Shake out the music of your speech ,</l>
     <l n="18">In quavers of delicious breath ;</l>
     <l n="19">The conscious melody may teach</l>
     <l n="20">A lover where love wandereth .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="21">If so you speak , with smile and look ,</l>
     <l n="22">You will not wither , but endure ;</l>
     <l n="23">And in my heart 's still open book ,</l>
     <l n="24">Keep your white petals ever pure .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="25">If so you speak , upon her breast</l>
     <l n="26">You yet may rest , nor sigh afar ;</l>
     <l n="27">But in the moonlight 's silver dressed ,</l>
     <l n="28">Seem ‘ gainst your heaven the evening star .</l>

    <head>ODYLE .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">We know that they are often near</l>
     <l n="2">Of whom we think , of whom we talk ,</l>
     <l n="3">Though we have missed them many a year ,</l>
     <l n="4">And lost them from our daily walk .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">Some strange clairvoyance dwells in all ,</l>
     <l n="6">And webs the souls of human kind .</l>
     <l n="7">I would that I could learn its thrall ,</l>
     <l n="8">And know the power of mind on mind .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">I then might quickly use the sense ,</l>
     <l n="10">To find where one I worship dwells ,</l>
     <l n="11">If in the city , or if thence</l>
     <l n="12">Among the breeze-rung lily bells .</l>

    <head>WHAT ONE FINDS IN THE COUNTRY .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">I went out in the country</l>
     <l n="2">To spend an idle day —</l>
     <l n="3">To see the flowers in blossom ,</l>
     <l n="4">And scent the fragrant hay .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">The dawn 's spears smote the mountains</l>
     <l n="6">Upon their shields of blue ,</l>
     <l n="7">And space , in her black valleys ,</l>
     <l n="8">Joined in the conflict too .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">The clouds were jellied amber ;</l>
     <l n="10">The crickets in the grass</l>
     <l n="11">Blew pipe and hammered tabor ,</l>
     <l n="12">And laughed to see me pass .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">The cows down in the pasture ,</l>

     <l n="16">Their happiness revealed .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="17">My heart was light and joyful ,</l>
     <l n="18">I could not answer why ;</l>
     <l n="19">And I thought that it was better</l>
     <l n="20">Always to smile than sigh .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="21">How could I hope to meet her</l>
     <l n="22">Whom most I wished to meet ?</l>
     <l n="23">If always I had lost her ,</l>
     <l n="24">Then life were incomplete .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="25">The road ran o'er a brooklet ;</l>
     <l n="26">Upon the bridge she stood ,</l>
     <l n="27">With wild flowers in her ringlets ,</l>
     <l n="28">And in her hand her hood .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="29">The morn laid on her features</l>
     <l n="30">An envious golden kiss ;</l>
     <l n="31">She might have fancied truly ,</l>
     <l n="32">I longed to share its bliss .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="33">I said , “ O , lovely maiden ,</l>
     <l n="34">I have sought you many a day .</l>
     <l n="35">That I love you , love you , love you ,</l>
     <l n="36">Is all that I can say . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="37">Her mournful eyes grew brighter ,</l>
     <l n="38">And archly glanced , though meek .</l>
     <l n="39">A bacchanalian dimple</l>
     <l n="40">Dipt a wine-cup in her cheek .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="41">“ If you love me , love me , love me ,</l>
     <l n="42">If you love me as you say ,</l>
     <l n="43">You must prove it , prove it , prove it ! ”</l>

    <head>AN AUNT AND AN UNCLE .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">I have but an aunt and an uncle</l>
     <l n="2">For kinsfolk on the earth ,</l>
     <l n="3">And one has passed me unnoticed</l>
     <l n="4">And hated me from my birth ;</l>
     <l n="5">But the first has reared me and taught me ,</l>
     <l n="6">Whatever I have of worth .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="7">This is my uncle by marriage ,</l>
     <l n="8">For his wife my aunt had died ,</l>
     <l n="9">And left him all her possessions ,</l>
     <l n="10">With much that was mine beside —</l>
     <l n="11">‘ Tis said that he hated her brother ,</l>
     <l n="12">As much as he loved the bride .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="13">That brother , my father , forgave him ,</l>
     <l n="14">As his last hour ran its sand ,</l>
     <l n="15">And begged in return his forgiveness ,</l>
     <l n="16">As he placed in his sister 's hand</l>
     <l n="17">The bonds , that when I was twenty ,</l>
     <l n="18">Should be at my command .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="19">For my mother was dead , God rest her ,</l>
     <l n="20">And I would be left alone .</l>
     <l n="21">The bride to her trust was unfaithful —</l>
     <l n="22">Her heart was harder than stone .</l>
     <l n="23">And her widowed sister , left childless ,</l>
     <l n="24">Adopted me as her own .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="25">So we dwelt in opposite houses —</l>
     <l n="26">We in a dwelling low ,</l>
     <l n="27">And he in a brown stone mansion .</l>
     <l n="28">I toiled and my gain was slow .</l>
     <l n="29">My uncle rode in a carriage</l>
     <l n="30">As fine as there was in the row .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="31">Once , in a useless anger ,</l>
     <l n="32">With courage not mine before ,</l>
     <l n="33">I bearded the crafty lion ,</l>
     <l n="34">Demanding my own , no more .</l>
     <l n="35">He said the law gave me nothing ,</l>
     <l n="36">And showed me out of his door .</l>

    <head>THE MAIDEN OF THE GOLDEN KIOSK .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">In the days when I , a beggar , wandered idly through the street ,</l>
     <l n="2">Past the palace , through the vineyards where the scented fountains play ,</l>
     <l n="3">Standing near the golden kiosk , it befell my lot to meet</l>
     <l n="4">One for whom my heart grew larger , and I could not turn away .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">Long my eyes upon the banquet of her beauty freely fed ;</l>
     <l n="6">How could I help but love her , whom the angels might adore !</l>
     <l n="7">But at last , tired of my staring , she turned away her head ;</l>
     <l n="8">Yet I saw the large pearls tremble that about her neck she wore .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">Either cheek was sea-shell tinted , and around her dewy lips</l>
     <l n="10">Played a smile that lingered lovingly , like star gleam on the sea ;</l>
     <l n="11">Thus emboldened , on my knees I fell , and kissed her finger tips ,</l>
     <l n="12">And begged of her , and prayed of her that I her slave might be .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">I was dark and swarthy featured , comely still in form and face ;</l>
     <l n="14">My long black hair hung glossily about my neck and head ;</l>
     <l n="15">My large jet eyes were lustrous , and I had an easy grace</l>
     <l n="16">That almost made a kingly robe my ragged garb of red .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="17">I chained the maiden with my arm , I would not let her go ;</l>
     <l n="18">She said she was Eudocia , that Yorghi was her sire ;</l>
     <l n="19">I said I was Demetrius , a beggar vile and low ,</l>
     <l n="20">But ‘ neath my heart 's one crucible love lit its fusing fire .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="21">Her sensuous long dark lashes hung above her dreamy eyes ,</l>
     <l n="22">Like twin clouds of stormy portent balanced over limpid deeps ;</l>
     <l n="23">Like the wings of birds of passage seen against the hazy skies ;</l>
     <l n="24">Like the petal o'er the pollen of the flow'ret when it sleeps .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="25">All her vesture was embroidered with the finest lace of gold ;</l>
     <l n="26">A diamond in her turban with its eye-like glitter shone ;</l>
     <l n="27">The white dress more than half revealed a form of perfect mould ,</l>
     <l n="28">And her cincture , dagger-fastened , shaped the garment to her zone .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="29">To my eyes she gave her dark eyes , down to gaze into and dream ;</l>
     <l n="30">And I seemed like one who leans above a bridge 's slender rail ,</l>
     <l n="31">And thinks , and gazes wistfully deep down into the stream ,</l>
     <l n="32">While the twilight gathers round him , and the gleam-winged stars prevail .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="33">After this I met her daily in the palace-garden ways ,</l>
     <l n="34">And she always came to meet me , and opened wide the gate ,</l>
     <l n="35">Often chiding , often smiling at my minute-long delays ,</l>
     <l n="36">And bringing dainty viands in a golden cup and plate .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="37">I , her lover , was a beggar , but she loved me all the same ;</l>
     <l n="38">Had I been Haroun Alraschid she could not have loved me more ;</l>
     <l n="39">While she whispered , on my lips and on my eyes she kissed my name ,</l>
     <l n="40">And vined her arms about my neck ; how could I but adore ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="41">But all pleasure cloys or ceases ; if the cup is stricken down ,</l>
     <l n="42">All its contents are like acid , burning deep a long regret ;</l>
     <l n="43">If it cloys , we calmly leave it , with perhaps a careless frown ,</l>
     <l n="44">Or may be a pleasant memory that is easy to forget .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="45">Once when in the golden kiosk , with Eudocia 's hand in mine ,</l>
     <l n="46">Came old Yorghi frowning darkly with the storm upon his face ;</l>
     <l n="47">Would she bring disgrace upon him ? Would she break his noble line ?</l>
     <l n="48">He stamped his fierce invective , and he drove me from the place .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="49">Ere I went I turned upon him , and I boldly claimed her hand ,</l>
     <l n="50">And vowed that I would have her , though the city barred my way ;</l>
     <l n="51">But he scoffed at me , a beggar , and repeated his command ,</l>
     <l n="52">Never more to meet his daughter , for my life 's sake , from that day .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">When the Bey passed by me graciously , I whispered in the ear</l>
     <l n="2">Of the one he led beside him ( should I fail to win her yet ! )</l>
     <l n="3">“ Our day is at its dawning ; I , Demetrius , am here ;</l>
     <l n="4">Meet me yonder in the garden , at the place where once we met . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">There she followed very quickly , and I held her to my heart ,</l>
     <l n="6">And kissed with fervid kisses all her lips and throat and chin .</l>
     <l n="7">Here she longed to dwell forever so that we might never part ,</l>
     <l n="8">And be fed with many kisses my enfolding arms within .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">There the amorous stars out-twinkled ; and anear , a sordid lake ,</l>
     <l n="10">Like a miser , hugged the silver of their glitter to its breast ;</l>
     <l n="11">And it stayed within the closet of the trees and tangled brake ,</l>
     <l n="12">Lest some fortunate bold robber should steal from it in its rest .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">Now the years had changed Eudocia from the rosebud to the rose ,</l>
     <l n="14">Made more perfect every feature , added many a gentle grace ,</l>
     <l n="15">And she made my heart her garden , there to dwell and find repose :</l>
     <l n="16">Neither time , nor change , nor absence , could her love for me efface .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="17">She said she too would be a lakelet , ‘ neath the starlight of my eyes ;</l>
     <l n="18">And when my lips bent downward she would catch their spicy dew ;</l>
     <l n="19">My face , low bending over , should become her tender skies ,</l>
     <l n="20">And my arms the goodly verdure that about the margin grew .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="21">I dared not risk to tell her of the traitor she was near ;</l>
     <l n="22">I said the Bey would tremble when I came to claim her hand ;</l>
     <l n="23">I said that she must wait me , and despair not ; but have cheer ,</l>
     <l n="24">For my triumph would be public in the corners of the land .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="25">While we spoke we heard commotion in the palace down the hill ;</l>
     <l n="26">Gay lights swung in the distance , like red fire-flies in a glen ;</l>
     <l n="27">Call by call was heard and answered with a herd of echoes shrill ,</l>
     <l n="28">And we saw a score of torches , and the issuing forth of men .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="29">“ Love , they seek you , ” cried Eudocia ; “ you must go or you must die . ”</l>
     <l n="30">But sad , O , sad the sundering of two hearts who long and weep ;</l>
     <l n="31">Rent the oak 's tough , knitted fibre by the lightning from on high ;</l>
     <l n="32">But the hearts will cling the closer that apart they strive to keep .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="33">On her lips I kissed my tears in , on her lips and on her eyes</l>
     <l n="34">Which she opened only languidly to show her answering tears ,</l>
     <l n="35">And I kissed the diamond crescent that I saw sink down and rise ,</l>
     <l n="36">While it flashed upon the torches with a hundred silver spears .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="37">Swooning , on a seat I laid her , then sped quickly through the gloom ,</l>
     <l n="38">While a torchman passed so near me that I fancied I was seen ;</l>
     <l n="39">But I hid me for a moment ‘ neath a bush of liberal bloom ,</l>
     <l n="40">Then fled onward to my entrance through the streets that intervene .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="41">Above , an imminent meteor flashed westward ‘ gainst the night ,—</l>
     <l n="42">A full moon with a bluer glow , and trailed with ruby shine ;</l>
     <l n="43">It seemed a blazing torch to me , borne onward with the flight</l>
     <l n="44">Of a spirit , that beneath it , brought defeat to Constantine .</l>

    <head>THE BATTLE .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">To the town outspoke the cannon , ere the dawn charged on the night ,</l>
     <l n="2">Not of peace and joy and amity , but of hatred and despair ,</l>
     <l n="3">And a thousand blatant bugles proved it waiting for their spite ;</l>
     <l n="4">And we heard the rasp of bullets in the dark astonished air .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">When the sun rose , hot and bloody , all the fight had well begun ;</l>
     <l n="6">The artillery were pounding at the weak place in the wall ;</l>
     <l n="7">While the smoke , from vale and city , seemed the melancholy , dun</l>
     <l n="8">Robes of spirits hovering over for the fated ones to fall .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">Like a strong Numidian lion , on her rock the city lay ,</l>
     <l n="10">Nothing daunted though surrounded , and with scanty store of bread ;</l>
     <l n="11">Her fierce eyes , two flags of crimson , stared through battle all the day ,</l>
     <l n="12">One on Babel Wad 's high key-stone , and one on Babel Djed .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">Round these gates they set their sworders , hoping thence to drive us back</l>
     <l n="14">When we followed up their sallies , which were baits to make us come ;</l>
     <l n="15">But in vain , our works were safer , though we longed for the attack ,</l>
     <l n="16">And eagerly awaited for the summons of the drum .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="17">Stone by stone a breach was opened in the thin place in the wall ,</l>
     <l n="18">Till at last we sent a truce flag to the gate of Babel Djed ,</l>
     <l n="19">Saying to the town , “ Surrender , Constantine must surely fall ;</l>
     <l n="20">If you fail , no soul remaining shall be left to count your dead . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="21">Like a sword-thrust was the answer , “ There is plenty in the place</l>
     <l n="22">Both of food and ammunition ; if ‘ tis these the French desire ,</l>
     <l n="23">We can furnish them abundance ; but surrender means disgrace ,</l>
     <l n="24">And our homes shall be defended while one soldier stands to fire . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="25">Should not this town be captured , every man must bear the fault ,</l>
     <l n="26">And many a one bethought him of his own in sunny France .</l>
     <l n="27">Down our line there ran the murmur , “ We must take it by assault , ”</l>
     <l n="28">And we heard the bugles playing for the stormers to advance .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="29">Like great billows never breaking were the rocks of Constantine ,</l>
     <l n="30">And a cargoed ship the city with its keel in every one ;</l>
     <l n="31">She was sailing for the future with the barter of the line ,</l>
     <l n="32">And her mast-like towers were gaudy with the pennons of the sun .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="33">But now a storm had struck her , and a hole was in her side ,</l>
     <l n="34">And the waters rushed in wildly while she paused upon the brink .</l>
     <l n="35">All in vain each brave endeavor ; for all on board her tried</l>
     <l n="36">To close the leak with fury , that the vessel might not sink .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="37">Our men the angry waters that could not be turned nor checked ,</l>
     <l n="38">And they bore all straws before them in their mad impetuous way .</l>
     <l n="39">So the town , betrayed , was captured ; so the great ship had been wrecked ;</l>
     <l n="40">And with the troops in triumph I rode in upon that day .</l>

    <head>THE WEDDING AND THE FALSE FRIEND .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">When the night fell , in the palace all the lights were lit again .</l>
     <l n="2">In the hall of silken standards and of Persia-woven mats</l>
     <l n="3">There were women fair as houris , there were brave and handsome men ;</l>
     <l n="4">And the fish leaped up to see them from the fountain 's silver vats .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">Never yet so fair Eudocia , and she won the wisest praise</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">But while yet they said the service , and ere yet I placed the ring</l>
     <l n="10">On her tapering heart finger , all the crowd was parted wide ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">“ Thus shall die the thankless traitor , whether king or beggar he ! ”</l>
     <l n="14">And a dagger gleamed above us with a fierce glare at the light ,</l>
     <l n="15">Then was struck upon my bosom near the place the heart might be ,</l>
     <l n="16">And my false friend , through the people , hastened wildly in his flight .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="17">But the mad bee gained no honey in his hurry to depart ;</l>

     <l n="19">For I wore , with faith , a secret , o'er the throbbing of my heart ,</l>
     <l n="20">The symbol of a higher life , a simple silver Cross .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="21">This had turned aside the weapon and spared me many years</l>

     <l n="24">The city of Jugurtha , my own mother Constantine .</l>

    <head>THE CHIEF 'S DAUGHTER .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">I was a naturalist , and had crossed the sea</l>
     <l n="2">And come to Theodosia , to find</l>
     <l n="3">A monstrous spider of which I had heard .</l>
     <l n="4">The people of the town wagged doubting heads ,</l>
     <l n="5">When asked about it ; but one day I met</l>
     <l n="6">A sturdy fisherman who once had seen</l>
     <l n="7">The spider , though he knew not his abode .</l>
     <l n="8">He said the spider was as long as he ,</l>
     <l n="9">And that the woof whereof he wove his web ,</l>
     <l n="10">Was thick as any cordage on his boat .</l>
     <l n="11">At night , belated ‘ mid the tumuli</l>
     <l n="12">That mound the hill-side and the vernal vale ,</l>
     <l n="13">Like the raised letters of an ancient page</l>
     <l n="14">Made for the blind gropers of to-day to read ,</l>
     <l n="15">He entered a dark tomb , and therein slept ,</l>
     <l n="16">Until the world , like some round shield upraised ,</l>
     <l n="17">Splintered the thrown spears of dawn . As he woke ,</l>
     <l n="18">He found himself ensnared in some thick web ,</l>
     <l n="19">Yet reached his knife , and slowly cut it through ;</l>
     <l n="20">Then when he stood , a monstrous spider fled .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="21">At this recital on the slanted shore ,</l>
     <l n="22">Another joined us from the cottage near —</l>
     <l n="23">A vine-clad cottage , lit for love 's abode .</l>
     <l n="24">A lily-croft , with trees , encinctured it ;</l>
     <l n="25">Like Ahab in his house of ivory</l>
     <l n="26">Dining on sweets , the king bee here</l>
     <l n="27">Sipped in the snowy lily 's palace hall ;</l>
     <l n="28">And here were yellow lilies strewn about ,</l>
     <l n="29">As though the place had been the banquet grove</l>
     <l n="30">Of Shishak , king of Egypt ; for the flowers</l>
     <l n="31">Seemed like the cups of gold that Solomon</l>

     <l n="33">“ This is my daughter , ” said the fisherman .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="37">( Often , in dreams , I thought it sweet to die ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="41">The modest maid a crimson jacket wore ,</l>

     <l n="43">While ‘ neath , the Turkish garment was confined</l>
     <l n="44">In plaits about the ankles ; but her shoes</l>
     <l n="45">Revealed the naked insteps of her feet .</l>
     <l n="46">I bade her there adieu , upon the shore</l>
     <l n="47">Of the clear Bospore . As I wandered back ,</l>
     <l n="48">I thought much of the spider that I sought ;</l>
     <l n="49">But more of two dark eyes , that seemed two stars</l>
     <l n="50">Which shone down in my heart ; while the far space</l>
     <l n="51">Behind them , pure , but unknown , was the soul .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="52">I thought to test this maiden 's charity ;</l>

     <l n="55">I strode abruptly from behind a wall ,</l>
     <l n="56">And faced her with a face disguised , and held</l>
     <l n="57">My hand out while I begged for some small alms .</l>
     <l n="58">She gave abundantly from her lean purse ,</l>
     <l n="59">And with a look of tender pity , passed .</l>
     <l n="60">It matters little who it is that asks ,</l>
     <l n="61">Or whether he deserves the alms or not ;</l>
     <l n="62">That given with free heart , is given to God ,</l>

     <l n="64">Day after day ,</l>

     <l n="67">Beneath her roof she made my welcome sweet ,</l>
     <l n="68">And yielded both her hands , and drew the scarf</l>
     <l n="69">That veiled the wondrous beauty of her face .</l>
     <l n="70">If painter , or if sculptor , in some dream ,</l>
     <l n="71">Could mingle Faith with Love and Charity ,</l>
     <l n="72">And give them utterance in one pure face ,</l>

     <l n="76">When , couched beneath his poppy parachute ,</l>
     <l n="77">Inactive Sleep came by . Her glances seemed</l>
     <l n="78">Like gold-winged angels sent from heavenly doors .</l>
     <l n="79">Yet she was often sad when I was near .</l>
     <l n="80">Once , tarrying late , I told her of my life ,</l>
     <l n="81">And of the monster I had come to find ;</l>
     <l n="82">But now , lo ! she around my heart had wound</l>
     <l n="83">The close web of her love , and held me fast</l>

     <l n="93">Her father was a brave Circassian chief ;</l>
     <l n="94">But here he dwelt disguised , till once again</l>
     <l n="95">He could lead on his race , and wound the heel</l>

     <l n="97">Our hearts made new ,</l>

     <l n="100">And seemed a sprawling spider , while two trees</l>
     <l n="101">That grew upon it , were his upraised arms</l>
     <l n="102">Clutching at two red fire-flies , that were stars .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">With day-break came a knuckle at my door ;</l>
     <l n="2">I rose , and opened , and upon the porch ,</l>
     <l n="3">His face like strange death 's , and his dark eyes wide</l>
     <l n="4">With some vague horror , stood the fisherman .</l>
     <l n="5">“ Come , hasten with me , ” were his only words .</l>
     <l n="6">We ran our best along the barren shore ,</l>
     <l n="7">And gained his silent cottage . Entering ,</l>
     <l n="8">He led me to his daughter 's vacant couch .</l>
     <l n="9">The room had but one window , and the sash</l>
     <l n="10">Was raised . I looked out to the ground beneath .</l>
     <l n="11">A vine crept up , and with long fingers made</l>
     <l n="12">Abode secure upon the cottage side ,</l>
     <l n="13">And o'er the window threw a leafy scarf .</l>
     <l n="14">But what was this , that fastened to the ledge</l>
     <l n="15">Trailed to the ground ? A glutinous rope</l>
     <l n="16">Twisted with five strands . This the fisherman</l>
     <l n="17">Saw with new horror , while between white lips</l>
     <l n="18">He gasped , “ The Spider ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="19">What was best to do ?</l>
     <l n="20">We saw strange foot-prints on the moistened beach ,</l>
     <l n="21">But these were lost soon in a wooded dell</l>
     <l n="22">Where all trace had an end . The long day through</l>
     <l n="23">We sought among the tombs , up from the dell ;</l>
     <l n="24">But unrewarded , when the sun was quenched ,</l>
     <l n="25">Sat down to weep . So darkness dropped ,</l>
     <l n="26">And like an awful spider , o'er the earth</l>
     <l n="27">Crawled with gaunt legs of shadow . Then our homes</l>
     <l n="28">We sadly sought , to meet again at morn .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="29">The night was warm , and with my window raised ,</l>
     <l n="30">I sat and mourned , and wrung my hopeless hands .</l>
     <l n="31">No light was in the house . I half reclined —</l>
     <l n="32">My back toward the window . Something shut</l>
     <l n="33">The puny sheen of starlight from the room .</l>
     <l n="34">The Thing , a monstrous shape , was with me there ,</l>
     <l n="35">And two hard arms were thrown about my waist .</l>
     <l n="36">For very terror I was hushed , nor moved</l>
     <l n="37">To cast my foe off . I was in the arms</l>
     <l n="38">Of the strong spider . As we went , I grew</l>
     <l n="39">Glad , for I thought that now I should be brought</l>
     <l n="40">To the great spider 's web , and there , mayhap ,</l>
     <l n="41">Learn the sad fate of her I loved so well .</l>
     <l n="42">Up a stark cliff we went , then crossed the web</l>
     <l n="43">Just as the red moon bloomed upon the hills</l>
     <l n="44">And silvered all the Panticapean vale .</l>
     <l n="45">The funnel of the web was in the mouth</l>
     <l n="46">Of a vast tomb , whose outside , hewn on rock ,</l>
     <l n="47">Outlined a Gorgon 's face with jaws agape —</l>
     <l n="48">Some stern Medusa , Stheno , or Euryale ,</l>
     <l n="49">Changed to the stone that in the elder days</l>
     <l n="50">She changed the sons of men who looked on her .</l>
     <l n="51">We passed the funnel , entering the tomb .</l>
     <l n="52">About my arms the spider threw his cords ,</l>
     <l n="53">And shackled them . I dared not move , but lay</l>
     <l n="54">Upon the smooth stone floor , inured to fear .</l>
     <l n="55">I fancied now that I was safe till dawn .</l>
     <l n="56">If I could use my hands I then might find</l>
     <l n="57">Some weapon of defense , some club , or stone ,</l>
     <l n="58">And so resist with some small chance for life .</l>
     <l n="59">The thought bred strength . I slowly drew my arms</l>
     <l n="60">Upon my sides , and , with persistence , gained</l>
     <l n="61">Their freedom ; though about the wrists , the flesh</l>
     <l n="62">Was bruised and harrowed , and my blood made wet</l>
     <l n="63">The spider 's cord wherewith I had been bound .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="64">The night seemed endless . As it came to dawn ,</l>
     <l n="65">A faint moan woke an echo in the tomb .</l>
     <l n="66">The echo seemed a cry of pity , sent</l>
     <l n="67">For solace to the moan . As light grew strong ,</l>
     <l n="68">I saw , not far from where I had been laid ,</l>
     <l n="69">A maiden sitting . All her hair set free ,</l>
     <l n="70">She made of it a pillow as she leaned</l>
     <l n="71">Against the painted wall . My heart threw wide</l>
     <l n="72">To her my arms , his hospitable doors ;</l>

     <l n="77">The trees upon the shore , her cottage stood ;</l>
     <l n="78">Then hoped ‘ gainst hope to enter it again .</l>
     <l n="79">Two thousand years ago , this distant sea</l>

     <l n="91">And spread his wings , and darted his sharp beak .</l>
     <l n="92">At last the spider caught him by the neck ,</l>
     <l n="93">With his serrated claws that grew like horns ,</l>
     <l n="94">And killed him ; then plucked the vanquished plumes ,</l>
     <l n="95">And sucked the warm blood from the sundered ends .</l>
     <l n="96">From this we knew the monster brought us here</l>

     <l n="117">A rich sarcophagus stood in the midst ,</l>
     <l n="118">Of deftly inlaid woods , or carved , or bronzed .</l>
     <l n="119">Within , a skeleton , its white skull crowned</l>

     <l n="140">Of threatening peril , we embraced ,</l>

     <l n="148">The sun was in the zenith . His back</l>
     <l n="149">Toward us , crouched the spider , at the mouth</l>
     <l n="150">Of our strange prison on the towering cliff .</l>
     <l n="151">The spider 's shape was full a fathom long .</l>
     <l n="152">Two parts it had , the fore part , head and breast ;</l>
     <l n="153">The hinder part , the trunk . The first was black ,</l>
     <l n="154">But all the last was covered with short hair ,</l>
     <l n="155">Yellow and fine . Eight sprawling legs adhered</l>
     <l n="156">To his tough breast . Eight eyes were in his head ,</l>
     <l n="157">Two in the front , and three on either side ;</l>
     <l n="158">They had no eyelids , and were never closed ,</l>
     <l n="159">Protected by a strong transparent nail .</l>
     <l n="160">His pincers grew between his foremost eyes —</l>
     <l n="161">Were toothed like saws , were venomous , and sharp ,</l>
     <l n="162">With claws on either end . Two arms stretched out</l>
     <l n="163">From his mailed shoulders , and with these he caught</l>
     <l n="164">His tangled prey , or guided what he spun .</l>
     <l n="165">Slowly the monster turned , and glared at us ,</l>
     <l n="166">Working his arms , and opening his claws ,</l>
     <l n="167">Then moved toward us fiercely for attack .</l>
     <l n="168">We ran to gain the limit of the tomb</l>
     <l n="169">Where darkness was ; there as we crouched with dread ,</l>
     <l n="170">My foot struck some hard substance . In despair</l>
     <l n="171">I grasped at it , and with great joy upheld</l>
     <l n="172">An ancient sword !— surely , a sharp , bold tooth</l>
     <l n="173">To bite the spider . I would sink it deep ,</l>
     <l n="174">Up to the gum of the crossed guard . Alert ,</l>
     <l n="175">I sprang upon the monster as he came ,</l>
     <l n="176">And with one blow cut off his brutish head .</l>
     <l n="177">He writhed awhile with pain , but in the end ,</l>
     <l n="178">Drew up the eight long legs and two thick arms ,</l>
     <l n="179">And rolling over on his useless back ,</l>
     <l n="180">Died with a pang .</l>

     <l n="181">So we issued forth ,</l>

     <l n="183">And glad the sky cloud-frescoed ‘ gainst the blue .</l>
     <l n="184">We sought the sea-side cottage , where the chief</l>
     <l n="185">Clasped once again his daughter to his breast .</l>
     <l n="186">Down from the hill we fetched the spider slain ,</l>
     <l n="187">And I to science gave these simple facts :</l>
     <l n="188">Spiders have no antennæ , therefore rank</l>
     <l n="189">Not with the insects . As they breathe with gills</l>
     <l n="190">Beneath the body , they possess a heart .</l>
     <l n="191">The treasure of the tomb brought wealth to us ,</l>
     <l n="192">And we who loved were wed one golden day ;</l>
     <l n="193">And the great Czar hearing our story told ,</l>
     <l n="194">Sent presents to the bride of silk and pearls .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">While yet upon his couch our father lay ,</l>
     <l n="2">Sick unto death , my brothers , with one mind ,</l>
     <l n="3">Plotted abrupt destruction to my life .</l>
     <l n="4">I did not tell the king , because I feared</l>
     <l n="5">To lessen by one heat the throbbing of his heart .</l>
     <l n="6">Beside his couch I knelt , and bowed my head —</l>
     <l n="7">I , his first-born , whom all the people loved .</l>
     <l n="8">His hot , weak hand he laid upon my hair ,</l>
     <l n="9">And blessed me with his blessing , then said on :</l>
     <l n="10">“ Thou hast beheld in Spring the dark green blade</l>
     <l n="11">That stabs up through the unresisting earth ;</l>
     <l n="12">At last the Summer crowns it with a flower .</l>
     <l n="13">So thou , when I am passed away , and gone to dust ,</l>
     <l n="14">Shalt wear a crown , but grander than the shrubs —</l>
     <l n="15">The symbol of a kingdom , on thy brow .</l>

     <l n="20">So he bent down with pain , and kissed my cheek ,</l>

   <lg type="poem">
    <head>THE NIGHT OF THE ESCAPE .</head>
     <l n="1">The night before the murder was to be ,</l>
     <l n="2">I drew my long , keen dagger from its sheath ,</l>
     <l n="3">And stole on down the marble stair-way , past</l>
     <l n="4">The throne-room , to the curtained arch wherein</l>
     <l n="5">My brothers lay asleep . No dream beset</l>
     <l n="6">The guilty Dead-Sea of their rest . They lay</l>
     <l n="7">Engulfed in pillows , like two ships mid waves .</l>
     <l n="8">I saw their faces , and the one was fair .</l>
     <l n="9">Long dark brown hair fell from his noble brow ,</l>
     <l n="10">And on the silken billow of the couch lay curled</l>
     <l n="11">Like spray . The other face was cold and dark</l>
     <l n="12">I felt no pity in my angry breast</l>
     <l n="13">For this , the older brother of the twain .</l>
     <l n="14">Yet he it was who always praised me most .</l>
     <l n="15">Praise is a dust of diamond that , if thrown</l>
     <l n="16">Well in the eyes of even noble men ,</l>
     <l n="17">Will blind them to a host of flagrant faults .</l>
     <l n="18">The moon was full , and ‘ twixt two silvered clouds</l>
     <l n="19">Looked forth , like any princess from between</l>
     <l n="20">The tasseled curtains of her downy bed .</l>
     <l n="21">The vagrant wind came through the opened blind ,</l>
     <l n="22">And whispered of the desert ; with its hand</l>
     <l n="23">Fanning the flame that in the silver urn</l>
     <l n="24">Mimicked a star . Beneath the rays I wrote :</l>
     <l n="25">I should have slain you both for your intent</l>
     <l n="26">Of murder ; but I spare , you , and I go .</l>
     <l n="27">So , take the kingdom , and ride long and well .</l>
     <l n="28">Between them there I laid the paper down ,</l>
     <l n="29">Then thrust my dagger , to the golden hilt ,</l>
     <l n="30">Through it , deep in the couch . So passing on ,</l>
     <l n="31">I came to that high room wherein my sire ,</l>
     <l n="32">The king , lay sick , and drifting near to death .</l>
     <l n="33">My tutor at his feet , and on the floor ,</l>
     <l n="34">Embraced by needed sleep , lay like a dog .</l>
     <l n="35">I came to see the king 's face once again ,</l>
     <l n="36">Ere , like a maid who in her lover trusts ,</l>
     <l n="37">I gave myself up , body and soul ,</l>
     <l n="38">To the great desert and the world beyond .</l>
     <l n="39">How sweetly slept the king ! His long white beard ,</l>
     <l n="40">And venerable face , were undisturbed</l>
     <l n="41">By even the breezy motion of his breath .</l>
     <l n="42">Surely , I thought , the fever must have passed .</l>
     <l n="43">I bent down tenderly to kiss the cheek .</l>
     <l n="44">How cold ! God help me , can the king be dead ?</l>
     <l n="45">My heart gave one wild bound , driving a wave</l>
     <l n="46">Of grief , vast as a mountain , up the sands</l>
     <l n="47">Of my bleak desolation . The wave broke</l>
     <l n="48">Into a blinding mist of tears at last .</l>
     <l n="49">I longed to moan out my despair , but paused ,</l>
     <l n="50">Checking my sobs to kiss the face once more ;</l>
     <l n="51">Then moved from the strange room , parting with care</l>
     <l n="52">The massive silken curtains , fearful then</l>
     <l n="53">Their rustle might attract some wakeful ear .</l>
     <l n="54">I found the jewels of the crown , and these</l>
     <l n="55">With all my own I in a bag secured ,</l>
     <l n="56">And hung about my neck , beneath my robe .</l>
     <l n="57">Noiseless as a ghost I passed the hall ,</l>
     <l n="58">And down the stair-way wrought of sandal-wood</l>
     <l n="59">Made lightest footsteps . As I stole</l>
     <l n="60">Along the alcoves where the maidens slept ,</l>
     <l n="61">A lady stood before me . She outstretched</l>
     <l n="62">Her white and naked arms , and round my neck</l>
     <l n="63">Entwined them . She was the captive , Veera ,</l>
     <l n="64">Once held for ransom from some Bedouin tribe ;</l>
     <l n="65">But when the coin was brought she would not go ;</l>
     <l n="66">At this the king was pleased , for thus she made</l>
     <l n="67">Perpetual peace between him and her kin .</l>
     <l n="68">No maid in Mesched up and down , was found</l>
     <l n="69">To rival her for beauty . All her words</l>
     <l n="70">Were apt and good , and all her ways were sweet .</l>
     <l n="71">I , in her happy prison , ivory-barred</l>
     <l n="72">By her white arms , was restless for release .</l>
     <l n="73">She would not set me free until I told</l>
     <l n="74">The purport of my vigil , and revealed</l>
     <l n="75">The place whereat my journey would be done .</l>
     <l n="76">I did not wait to pay her back her kiss .</l>
     <l n="77">I hurried to the stables , where I found</l>
     <l n="78">My coal-black steed . He neighed and pawed the floor .</l>
     <l n="79">I bound the saddle firmly , grasped the reins ,</l>
     <l n="80">And in a moment passed the city 's gate ,</l>
     <l n="81">And shot out on the desert , where the wind</l>
     <l n="82">Made race with us , but lagged behind at last .</l>

    <head>THE DOOR .</head>
     <l n="1">Among the books that I had bought myself ,</l>
     <l n="2">I found the Bible . This to peruse</l>
     <l n="3">I soon essayed ; but ere I had read far ,</l>
     <l n="4">Behold ! I found the door behind which lay</l>
     <l n="5">The answers to my problems . Locked and barred</l>
     <l n="6">The door was , yet I knew it was the door .</l>
     <l n="7">For here I read of Eden , and that in the midst</l>
     <l n="8">The Tree of Life stood , while through the land</l>
     <l n="9">A river ran which parted in four heads ;</l>
     <l n="10">And one was Gihon , the Ethiop stream ;</l>
     <l n="11">And one was Pison , the great crystal tide</l>
     <l n="12">Which floods Havilah , where fine gold is found ,</l>
     <l n="13">And rare bdellium and the onyx stone .</l>
     <l n="14">So , as my tutor said , my problems were</l>
     <l n="15">A dual secret , and the one contained</l>
     <l n="16">The other . All the long night through I pored</l>
     <l n="17">Above the words , and kissed the unconscious page</l>
     <l n="18">With reverent lips . My heart was like a sponge</l>

    <head>NEWS FROM MESCHED .</head>
     <l n="1">Down the long street , upon my iron-black steed ,</l>
     <l n="2">I rode and pondered . Where shall I seek to find</l>
     <l n="3">A sweet soul pure as dawn , who to my will shall be</l>
     <l n="4">Both malleable and ductile ; who can soar</l>
     <l n="5">Over the whole earth , or go back in the past ?</l>
     <l n="6">While yet I mused , lo , up a garden walk ,</l>
     <l n="7">A lady chased a bird . An empty cage</l>
     <l n="8">Stood in the vine-clad cottage-window near .</l>
     <l n="9">The bird was like some sweet elusive thought ;</l>
     <l n="10">The maid , a Sappho , weary with pursuit .</l>
     <l n="11">She only glanced my way to see me pass ,</l>
     <l n="12">Then turned and ran towards me , her large eyes</l>
     <l n="13">With gladness scintillant . It was the maid ,</l>
     <l n="14">Veera . Her hand upon my shoulder , up the walk</l>
     <l n="15">We went , my steed following , while her bird ,</l>
     <l n="16">Tired of his liberty , had found his cage .</l>
     <l n="17">Strange news had Veera . Here she lived in peace ;</l>
     <l n="18">But through the city she had sought me long .</l>
     <l n="19">When I was gone from Mesched , and my brothers read</l>
     <l n="20">The paper I had written , their wrath rose</l>
     <l n="21">Against my tutor whom they deemed the spy .</l>
     <l n="22">He , being found asleep beside the king</l>
     <l n="23">Who lay dead , to his door they brought</l>
     <l n="24">The baseless charge of murder . Through the streets</l>
     <l n="25">They sent their criers to proclaim the deed .</l>
     <l n="26">So , clamorous for his life , the people came</l>
     <l n="27">And dragged him forth , and led him to the block</l>
     <l n="28">And slew him . On a spear they set his head ,</l>
     <l n="29">And placed it high upon the tower above</l>
     <l n="30">The eastern gate . The birds pecked at the eyes ,</l>
     <l n="31">And of the hair made comfortable nests .</l>
     <l n="32">The rain beat on it , and the active wind</l>
     <l n="33">Crowned it with desert dust . Always the sun</l>
     <l n="34">Made salutation to it , flushing it</l>
     <l n="35">Until it seemed more ghastly than before .</l>
     <l n="36">But after this mad crime the older brother grew</l>
     <l n="37">Jealous of him , the younger . One dark morn</l>
     <l n="38">They found the last-born lifeless in the street ,</l>
     <l n="39">Stabbed by a long , sharp poniard in the back .</l>
     <l n="40">Misrule followed misrule , and justice fled .</l>
     <l n="41">Laws were abolished , and pleasure 's lewdest voice</l>
     <l n="42">Hawked in the market-place , and through the streets .</l>
     <l n="43">Her story done , Veera entreated me</l>
     <l n="44">To set my face for Mesched with the dawn .</l>
     <l n="45">“ Not yet , ” I said , “ not yet . ” And then I made</l>
     <l n="46">Strange passes with my hands , and braced my will ,</l>
     <l n="47">To sway her will ; then with a questioning glance</l>
     <l n="48">She passed out to a calm Mesmeric sleep .</l>
     <l n="49">So , well I knew that I had found the soul</l>
     <l n="50">My purpose needed , and I bade her wake .</l>

    <head>THE MIDNIGHT VISITOR .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">I sat and pondered in my room that night</l>
     <l n="2">Until the towers and steeples , near and far ,</l>

     <l n="4">Of midnight . Then I wrought magnetic force</l>
     <l n="5">With waving hands ; and set my swerveless will</l>
     <l n="6">That Veera should approach me , and that none</l>
     <l n="7">Should harm or see her as she passed the streets .</l>
     <l n="8">At last I heard her footstep on the stair —</l>
     <l n="9">The patter of her feet as soft as rain ,</l>
     <l n="10">And then she turned the hinge and entered in .</l>
     <l n="11">A long white wrapper made of satin , bound</l>
     <l n="12">With lace of gold , and fastened at the throat</l>
     <l n="13">With buttons of cut diamond , clad her form .</l>
     <l n="14">A band of opals was around her neck —</l>
     <l n="15">A hundred little worlds with central fires .</l>
     <l n="16">Her feet were naked , and her hair was down .</l>
     <l n="17">Her large eyes , wide and staring , took no heed</l>
     <l n="18">Of anything before them ; thus she slept .</l>
     <l n="19">I bade her sit beside me , and I placed</l>
     <l n="20">The Bible on her knee , and laid her hand</l>
     <l n="21">Upon the verse that names the tree of life .</l>
     <l n="22">“ Tell me , ” I said , “ where may this tree be found . ”</l>

     <l n="26">The sun scorches like fire . I am athirst .</l>
     <l n="27">I cannot find the tree ; my search is done . ”</l>
     <l n="28">“ Look down the past , and find if any knew</l>

     <l n="30">Again her lips made answer : “ One I see ,</l>
     <l n="31">Long dead , who bends above a written scroll ,</l>
     <l n="32">And therein makes strange characters , which hold</l>
     <l n="33">Some hidden sense pertaining to this tree .</l>
     <l n="34">In Milan , in the Ambrosian library there ,</l>
     <l n="35">I see this scroll to-night ; ‘ tis worn with age . ”</l>

     <l n="39">Along the dark , deserted street , and I</l>

    <head>THE PALIMPSEST .</head>
     <l n="1">In Milan , in the Ambrosian library there ,</l>
     <l n="2">Among Pinellian writings seared with age ,</l>
     <l n="3">I found a prophet 's palimpsest — a scroll</l>
     <l n="4">That Angelo Maio had brought to light .</l>
     <l n="5">And on the margin of this scroll , I found</l>
     <l n="6">Mysterious signs which baffled me at first .</l>
     <l n="7">After a full week 's search I chanced to find</l>
     <l n="8">The mongrel dialect of which they were .</l>
     <l n="9">I thus translated : Gihon is the Nile .</l>
     <l n="10">A perfect soul may find long life and gold .</l>
     <l n="11">Surely , I thought , Veera the maid is pure .</l>
     <l n="12">Her life 's blue sky has not one cloud of sin .</l>
     <l n="13">If her feet press the soil where Eve first trod ,</l>
     <l n="14">I can but follow and attain . So I</l>
     <l n="15">Back to Vienna came and found Veera .</l>
     <l n="16">To her I made my double purpose plain ,</l>
     <l n="17">And prayed her to go with me in my search .</l>
     <l n="18">She smiled assent . To be near me , she said ,</l>
     <l n="19">Had brought her to Vienna ; this indeed</l>
     <l n="20">Detained her from her kinsmen . Her heart 's book</l>
     <l n="21">Lay open to me , and I read her love .</l>
     <l n="22">So we were wed , and both lives ran to one .</l>

     <l n="1">Now for the Nile we journeyed , gaining first</l>
     <l n="2">The town of Gondokoro , where the stream</l>
     <l n="3">Of Bahr el Abiad , or White Nile , flows .</l>
     <l n="4">Thence we passed on , and with the savage kings</l>
     <l n="5">Of Karagwe , Uganda and Ungoro , stopped ,</l>
     <l n="6">To rest our weary feet , or in their huts</l>
     <l n="7">Escape the sun 's fierce glare . At last we found</l>
     <l n="8">The sources of the Nile ; two lakes that now</l>
     <l n="9">Are called Nyanza and Nzige . If here</l>
     <l n="10">I had but paused , and had retraced my steps ,</l>
     <l n="11">The whole world would have known and praised my name ,</l>
     <l n="12">For I was first to find the secret out .</l>
     <l n="13">But then I cared not for it , journeying on .</l>
     <l n="14">After a week , we came upon a land</l>
     <l n="15">All void , and barren of a single leaf .</l>
     <l n="16">Veera was pale and worn , although she bore</l>
     <l n="17">Fatigue with generous patience for my sake .</l>
     <l n="18">Our feet were swollen , and with the hot sand scorched ,</l>
     <l n="19">Our garments were in tatters , and we seemed</l>
     <l n="20">Like beggars , in a land where there were none to give .</l>
     <l n="21">At night we slept beside a wide , cool stream ,</l>
     <l n="22">Whereat we quenched our thirst , and bathed our feet .</l>
     <l n="23">My beard was grown , and all my hair hung down</l>
     <l n="24">Neglected , on my shoulders . I was weak ,</l>
     <l n="25">And thin , and feverish , and Veera , too ,</l>
     <l n="26">I saw was sick , and languished hour by hour .</l>

    <head>GOLD !</head>
     <l n="1">In the sand , lo ! something to the sun</l>
     <l n="2">Replied with brilliant lustre ; as I brushed</l>
     <l n="3">The dust away , I saw that it was gold !—</l>
     <l n="4">A solid bar of gold — and yet so weak</l>
     <l n="5">Was I , I could not move it from its place .</l>
     <l n="6">I would have given then the bar of gold</l>
     <l n="7">To buy a crust , but could not . So we passed ,</l>
     <l n="8">And came where five great rivers went their ways .</l>
     <l n="9">Which should we follow ? One I knew</l>
     <l n="10">Led to the tree of life , but all the rest</l>
     <l n="11">Went back to death . Here a dead bird we found ,</l>
     <l n="12">And tearing off its gaudy plumage , ate .</l>
     <l n="13">Upon occasional trees grew strange sparse fruits ,</l>
     <l n="14">And these sustained us as we wandered on .</l>
     <l n="15">Along the banks for many a mile we went</l>
     <l n="16">By each of these five rivers , then returned .</l>
     <l n="17">So all my hope was dead , and long I prayed</l>
     <l n="18">That I might live to see my land again .</l>

    <head>THE MESSAGE OF THE THREE MEN .</head>
     <l n="1">The night came on , and unto sleep we gave</l>
     <l n="2">Our spirits . When the golden day was born</l>
     <l n="3">Veera awoke , and told me all her dream ;</l>
     <l n="4">“ Lo , in the night three men have talked with me —</l>
     <l n="5">Three strange good men who said the kindest words ,</l>
     <l n="6">And said that only those who were released</l>
     <l n="7">From sin , could find the garden of the Lord .</l>
     <l n="8">And this release was bought upon a cross</l>
     <l n="9">By One , a Nazarene , with priceless blood .</l>
     <l n="10">If He would bear our sins , then we might reach</l>
     <l n="11">The garden ; but we must not touch or eat</l>
     <l n="12">The tree of life that flourished in the midst . ”</l>
     <l n="13">Then I abased my soul , and prayed again ,</l>
     <l n="14">And cast off all the burden of my sins ,</l>
     <l n="15">Tearing my strange ambition from my heart .</l>
     <l n="16">And Veera , too , embraced the Christian Faith .</l>
     <l n="17">So we arose , and went upon our way ,</l>
     <l n="18">And journeying eastward , Eden found at last !</l>

    <head>THE GARDEN .</head>
     <l n="1">The trees were housed with nests , and every one</l>
     <l n="2">Was like a city of song . The streams too</l>
     <l n="3">Were voluble ; they laughed and gurgled there</l>
     <l n="4">Like men who , at a banquet , sit and drink</l>
     <l n="5">And chatter . All the grass was like a robe</l>
     <l n="6">Of velvet , and there was no need of rain .</l>
     <l n="7">In dells roofed with green leafage , nature spread</l>
     <l n="8">Couches meet for a Sybarite . Sweet food</l>
     <l n="9">The servant trees extended us to eat</l>
     <l n="10">In their long , branchy arms . Even the sun</l>
     <l n="11">Was tempered , and the sky was always blue .</l>
     <l n="12">Corpulent grapes along the crystal rocks ,</l>
     <l n="13">Made consorts of the long-robed lady leaves .</l>
     <l n="14">The butterfly and bee , from morn till eve ,</l>
     <l n="15">Consulted with the roses , lip to lip ,</l>
     <l n="16">Which grew in rank profusion . They at times</l>
     <l n="17">Dared to invade the empire of the grass ,</l>
     <l n="18">And overthrew its green-robed , spear-armed hosts .</l>
     <l n="19">The lilies too were like an army there ,</l>
     <l n="20">And every night they struck their snowy tents ,</l>
     <l n="21">To please their great commander , the round moon —</l>

     <l n="1">As to the heliotrope comes fluttering down</l>
     <l n="2">The peacock-butterfly , who sips and flies ,</l>
     <l n="3">So each glad day gold-winged came to the land</l>
     <l n="4">And sipped its sip of time and fled away .</l>
     <l n="5">Now in an evil hour I hungered , and I saw</l>
     <l n="6">The tree of life that grew forbidden fruit .</l>
     <l n="7">What harm , I thought , is there to always live ?</l>
     <l n="8">To live is happiness ; but to die is pain .</l>
     <l n="9">The rental claimed by death falls due too soon .</l>
     <l n="10">So I reached forth , and took the fruit , and ate .</l>
     <l n="11">Then all the sky grew dark , and from the land</l>
     <l n="12">Malignant terrors drove me shrieking forth ;</l>
     <l n="13">And as I fled , my youth abandoned me ;</l>
     <l n="14">My hair turned gray , my shoulders stooped , my blood</l>
     <l n="15">Grew colder , and my perfect form was changed .</l>
     <l n="16">A weak old man with wrinkled face , I fled ,</l>
     <l n="17">To wander in the wastes . Once I looked back</l>
     <l n="18">Upon the garden ; over it the sky</l>
     <l n="19">Was soft and clear ; and midway in the air</l>
     <l n="20">I saw Veera between two angels , borne</l>

      <l n="24">The moon , half-shadowed , trailed its silver robe</l>
      <l n="25">Over the tower above the eastern gate ,</l>
      <l n="26">And there revealed the outlines of a skull</l>
