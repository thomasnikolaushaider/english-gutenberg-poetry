    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>COMMENT ON THE POEM .</p>
   <p>The secret of a poem , no less than a jest 's prosperity , lies in the ear of him that hears it . Yield to its spell , accept the poet 's mood : this , after all , is what the sages answer when you ask them of its value . Even though the poet himself , in his other mood , tell you that his art is but sleight of hand , his food enchanter 's food , and offer to show you the trick of it ,— believe him not . Wait for his prophetic hour ; then give yourself to his passion , his joy or pain . “ We are in Love 's hand to-day ! ” sings Gautier , in Swinburne 's buoyant paraphrase ,— and from morn to sunset we are wafted on the violent sea : there is but one love , one May , one flowery strand . Love is eternal , all else unreal and put aside . The vision has an end , the scene changes ; but we have gained something , the memory of a charm . As many poets , so many charms . There is the charm of Evanescence , that which lends to supreme beauty and grace an aureole of Pathos . Share with Landor his one “ night of memories and of sighs ” for Rose Aylmer , and you have this to the full .</p>
   <p>And now take the hand of a new-world minstrel , strayed from some proper habitat to that rude and dissonant America which , as Baudelaire saw , “ was for Poe only a vast prison through which he ran , hither and thither , with the feverish agitation of a being created to breathe in a purer world , ” and where “ his interior life , spiritual as a poet , spiritual even as a drunkard , was but one perpetual effort to escape the influence of this antipathetical atmosphere . ” Clasp the sensitive hand of a troubled singer dreeing thus his weird , and share with him the clime in which he found ,— never throughout the day , always in the night ,— if not the Atlantis whence he had wandered , at least a place of refuge from the bounds in which by day he was immured .</p>
   <p>To one land only he has power to lead you , and for one night only can you share his dream . A tract of neither Earth nor Heaven : “ No-man'shYpppHeNland , ” out of Space , out of Time . Here are the perturbed ones , through whose eyes , like those of the Cenci , the soul finds windows though the mind is dazed ; here spirits , groping for the path which leads to Eternity , are halted and delayed . It is the limbo of “ planetary souls , ” wherein are all moonlight uncertainties , all lost loves and illusions . Here some are fixed in trance , the only respite attainable ; others</p>
   <p>“ move fantastically To a discordant melody : ”</p>
   <p>while everywhere are</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Sheeted Memories of the Past —</l>
     <l n="2">Shrouded forms that start and sigh</l>
     <l n="3">As they pass the wanderer by . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Such is the land , and for one night we enter it ,— a night of astral phases and recurrent chimes . Its monodies are twelve poems , whose music strives to change yet ever is the same . One by one they sound , like the chiming of the brazen and ebony clock , in “ The Masque of the Red Death , ” which made the waltzers pause with “ disconcert and tremulousness and meditation , ” as often as the hour came round .</p>
   <p>Of all these mystical cadences , the plaint of The Raven , vibrating through the portal , chiefly has impressed the outer world . What things go to the making of a poem ,— and how true in this , as in most else , that race which named its bards “ the makers ” ? A work is called out of the void . Where there was nothing , it remains ,— a new creation , part of the treasure of mankind . And a few exceptional lyrics , more than others that are equally creative , compel us to think anew how bravely the poet 's pen turns things unknown</p>
   <p>“ to shapes , and gives to airy nothing A local habitation , and a name . ”</p>
   <p>Each seems without a prototype , yet all fascinate us with elements wrested from the shadow of the Supernatural . Now the highest imagination is concerned about the soul of things ; it may or may not inspire the Fantasy that peoples with images the interlunar vague . Still , one of these lyrics , in its smaller way , affects us with a sense of uniqueness , as surely as the sublimer works of a supernatural cast ,— Marlowe 's “ Faustus , ” the “ Faust ” of Goethe , “ Manfred , ” or even those ethereal masterpieces , “ The Tempest ” and “ A Midsummer Night 's Dream . ” More than one , while otherwise unique , has some burden or refrain which haunts the memory ,— once heard , never forgotten , like the tone of a rarely used but distinctive organ-stop . Notable among them is Bürger 's “ Lenore , ” that ghostly and resonant ballad , the lure and foil of the translators . Few will deny that Coleridge 's wondrous “ Rime of the Ancient Mariner ” stands at their very head . “ Le Juif-Errant ” would have claims , had Beranger been a greater poet ; and , but for their remoteness from popular sympathy , “ The Lady of Shalott ” and “ The Blessed Damozel ” might be added to the list . It was given to Edgar Allan Poe to produce two lyrics , “ The Bells ” and The Raven , each of which , although perhaps of less beauty than those of Tennyson and Rossetti , is a unique . “ Ulalume , ” while equally strange and imaginative , has not the universal quality that is a portion of our test .</p>
   <p>The Raven in sheer poetical constituents falls below such pieces as “ The Haunted Palace , ” “ The City in the Sea , ” “ The Sleeper , ” and “ Israfel . ” The whole of it would be exchanged , I suspect , by readers of a fastidious cast , for such passages as these :</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ Around , by lifting winds forgot ,</l>
     <l n="2">Resignedly beneath the sky</l>
     <l n="3">The melancholy waters lie .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="4">No rays from the holy heaven come down</l>
     <l n="5">On the long night-time of that town ;</l>
     <l n="6">But light from out the lurid sea</l>
     <l n="7">Streams up the turrets silently —</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="8">Up many and many a marvellous shrine</l>
     <l n="9">Whose wreathéd friezes intertwine</l>
     <l n="10">The viol , the violet , and the vine .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="11">No swellings tell that winds may be</l>
     <l n="12">Upon some far-off happier sea —</l>
     <l n="13">No heavings hint that winds have been</l>
     <l n="14">On seas less hideously serene . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="15">It lacks the aerial melody of the poet whose heart-strings are a lute :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="16">“ And they say ( the starry choir</l>
     <l n="17">And the other listening things )</l>
     <l n="18">That Israfeli 's fire</l>
     <l n="19">Is owing to that lyre</l>
     <l n="20">By which he sits and sings —</l>
     <l n="21">The trembling living wire</l>
     <l n="22">Of those unusual strings . ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>But The Raven , like “ The Bells ” and “ Annabel Lee , ” commends itself to the many and the few . I have said elsewhere that Poe 's rarer productions seemed to me “ those in which there is the appearance , at least , of spontaneity ,— in which he yields to his feelings , while dying falls and cadences most musical , most melancholy , come from him unawares . ” This is still my belief ; and yet , upon a fresh study of this poem , it impresses me more than at any time since my boyhood . Close acquaintance tells in favor of every true work of art . Induce the man , who neither knows art nor cares for it , to examine some poem or painting , and how soon its force takes hold of him ! In fact , he will overrate the relative value of the first good work by which his attention has been fairly caught . The Raven , also , has consistent qualities which even an expert must admire . In no other of its author 's poems is the motive more palpably defined . “ The Haunted Palace ” is just as definite to the select reader , but Poe scarcely would have taken that subtle allegory for bald analysis . The Raven is wholly occupied with the author 's typical theme — the irretrievable loss of an idolized and beautiful woman ; but on other grounds , also , the public instinct is correct in thinking it his representative poem .</p>
   <p>A man of genius usually gains a footing with the success of some one effort , and this is not always his greatest . Recognition is the more instant for having been postponed . He does not acquire it , like a miser 's fortune , coin after coin , but “ not at all or all in all . ” And thus with other ambitions : the courtier , soldier , actor ,— whatever their parts ,— each counts his triumph from some lucky stroke . Poe 's Raven , despite augury , was for him “ the bird that made the breeze to blow . ” The poet settled in New-York , in the winter of 1844 - ‘ 45 , finding work upon Willis 's paper , “ The Evening Mirror , ” and eking out his income by contributions elsewhere . For six years he had been an active writer , and enjoyed a professional reputation ; was held in both respect and misdoubt , and was at no loss for his share of the ill-paid journalism of that day . He also had done much of his very best work ,— such tales as “ Ligeia ” and “ The Fall of the House of Usher , ” ( the latter containing that mystical counterpart , in verse , of Elihu Vedder 's “ A Lost Mind , ” ) such analytic feats as “ The Gold Bug ” and “ The Mystery of Marie Roget . ” He had made proselytes abroad , and gained a lasting hold upon the French mind . He had learned his own power and weakness , and was at his prime , and not without a certain reputation . But he had written nothing that was on the tongue of everybody . To rare and delicate work some popular touch must be added to capture the general audience of one 's own time .</p>
   <p>Through the industry of Poe 's successive biographers , the hit made by The Raven has become an oft-told tale . The poet 's young wife , Virginia , was fading before his eyes , but lingered for another year within death 's shadow . The long , low chamber in the house near the Bloomingdale Road is as famous as the room where Rouget de l'Isle composed the Marseillaise . All have heard that the poem , signed “ Quarles , ” appeared in the “ American Review , ” with a pseudo-editorial comment on its form ; that Poe received ten dollars for it ; that Willis , the kindest and least envious of fashionable arbiters , reprinted it with a eulogy that instantly made it town-talk . All doubt of its authorship was dispelled when Poe recited it himself at a literary gathering , and for a time he was the most marked of American authors . The hit stimulated and encouraged him . Like another and prouder satirist , he too found “ something of summer ” even “ in the hum of insects . ” Sorrowfully enough , but three years elapsed ,— a period of influence , pride , anguish , yet always of imaginative or critical labor ,— before the final defeat , before the curtain dropped on a life that for him was in truth a tragedy , and he yielded to “ the Conqueror Worm . ”</p>
   <p>“ The American Review : A Whig Journal ” was a creditable magazine for the time , double-columned , printed on good paper with clear type , and illustrated by mezzotint portraits . Amid much matter below the present standard , it contained some that any editor would be glad to receive . The initial volume , for 1845 , has articles by Horace Greeley , Donald Mitchell , Walter Whitman , Marsh , Tuckerman , and Whipple . Ralph Hoyt 's quaint poem , “ Old , ” appeared in this volume . And here are three lyrics by Poe : “ The City in the Sea , ” “ The Valley of Unrest , ” and The Raven . Two of these were built up ,— such was his way ,— from earlier studies , but the last-named came out as if freshly composed , and almost as we have it now . The statement that it was not afterward revised is erroneous . Eleven trifling changes from the magazine-text appear in The Raven and Other Poems , 1845 , a book which the poet shortly felt encouraged to offer the public . These are mostly changes of punctuation , or of single words , the latter kind made to heighten the effect of alliteration . In Mr. Lang 's pretty edition of Poe 's verse , brought out in the “ Parchment Library , ” he has shown the instinct of a scholar , and has done wisely , in going back to the text in the volume just mentioned , as given in the London issue of 1846 . The “ standard ” Griswold collection of the poet 's works abounds with errors . These have been repeated by later editors , who also have made errors of their own . But the text of The Raven , owing to the requests made to the author for manuscript copies , was still farther revised by him ; in fact , he printed it in Richmond , just before his death , with the poetic substitution of “ seraphim whose foot-falls ” for “ angels whose faint foot-falls , ” in the fourteenth stanza . Our present text , therefore , while substantially that of 1845 , is somewhat modified by the poet 's later reading , and is , I think , the most correct and effective version of this single poem . The most radical change from the earliest version appeared , however , in the volume in 1845 ; the eleventh stanza originally having contained these lines , faulty in rhyme and otherwise a blemish on the poem :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Caught from some unhappy master , whom unmerciful Disaster</l>
     <l n="2">Followed fast and followed faster — so , when Hope he would adjure ,</l>
     <l n="3">Stern Despair returned , instead of the sweet Hope he dared adjure —</l>
     <l n="4">That sad answer , ‘ Nevermore ! ’ ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>It would be well if other , and famous , poets could be as sure of making their changes always improvements . Poe constantly rehandled his scanty show of verse , and usually bettered it . The Raven was the first of the few poems which he nearly brought to completion before printing . It may be that those who care for poetry lost little by his death . Fluent in prose , he never wrote verse for the sake of making a poem . When a refrain of image haunted him , the lyric that resulted was the inspiration , as he himself said , of a passion , not of a purpose . This was at intervals so rare as almost to justify the Fairfield theory that each was the product of a nervous crisis .</p>
   <p>What , then , gave the poet his clue to The Raven ? From what misty foundation did it rise slowly to a music slowly breathed ? As usual , more than one thing went to the building of so notable a poem . Considering the longer sermons often preached on brief and less suggestive texts , I hope not to be blamed for this discussion of a single lyric ,— especially one which an artist like Doré has made the subject of prodigal illustration . Until recently I had supposed that this piece , and a few which its author composed after its appearance , were exceptional in not having grown from germs in his boyish verse . But Mr . Fearing Gill has shown me some unpublished stanzas by Poe , written in his eighteenth year , and entitled , “ The Demon of the Fire . ” The manuscript appears to be in the poet 's early handwriting , and its genuineness is vouched for by the family in whose possession it has remained for half a century . Besides the plainest germs of “ The Bells ” and “ The Haunted Palace ” it contains a few lines somewhat suggestive of the opening and close of The Raven . As to the rhythm of our poem , a comparison of dates indicates that this was influenced by the rhythm of “ Lady Geraldine 's Courtship . ” Poe was one of the first to honor Miss Barrett 's genius ; he inscribed his collected poems to her as “ the noblest of her sex , ” and was in sympathy with her lyrical method . The lines from her love-poem ,</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ With a murmurous stir uncertain , in the air , the purple curtain</l>
     <l n="2">Swelleth in and swelleth out around her motionless pale brows , ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">found an echo in these :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="4">“ And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain</l>
     <l n="5">Thrilled me — filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before . ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Here Poe assumed a privilege for which he roughly censured Longfellow , and which no one ever sought on his own premises without swift detection and chastisement . In melody and stanzaic form , we shall see that the two poems are not unlike , but in motive they are totally distinct . The generous poetess felt nothing but the true originality of the poet . “ This vivid writing ! ” she exclaimed ,— “ this power which is felt !... Our great poet , Mr. Browning , author of ‘ Paracelsus , ’ &amp; c ., is enthusiastic in his admiration of the rhythm . ” Mr. Ingram , after referring to “ Lady Geraldine , ” cleverly points out another source from which Poe may have caught an impulse . In 1843 , Albert Pike , the half-Greek , half-frontiersman , poet of Arkansas , had printed in “ The New Mirror , ” for which Poe then was writing , some verses entitled “ Isadore , ” but since revised by the author and called “ The Widowed Heart . ” I select from Mr. Pike 's revision the following stanza , of which the main features correspond with the original version :</p>

     <l n="1">“ Restless I pace our lonely rooms , I play our songs no more ,</l>
     <l n="2">The garish sun shines flauntingly upon the unswept floor ;</l>
     <l n="3">The mocking-bird still sits and sings , O melancholy strain !</l>
     <l n="4">For my heart is like an autumn-cloud that overflows with rain ;</l>
     <l n="5">Thou art lost to me forever , Isadore ! ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Here we have a prolonged measure , a similarity of refrain , and the introduction of a bird whose song enhances sorrow . There are other trails which may be followed by the curious ; notably , a passage which Mr. Ingram selects from Poe 's final review of “ Barnaby Rudge ":</p>
   <p>“ The raven , too , * * * might have been made , more than we now see it , a portion of the conception of the fantastic Barnaby . * * * Its character might have performed , in regard to that of the idiot , much the same part as does , in music , the accompaniment in respect to the air . ”</p>
   <p>Nevertheless , after pointing out these germs and resemblances , the value of this poem still is found in its originality . The progressive music , the scenic detail and contrasted light and shade ,— above all , the spiritual passion of the nocturn , make it the work of an informing genius . As for the gruesome bird , he is unlike all the other ravens of his clan , from the “ twa corbies ” and “ three ravens ” of the balladists to Barnaby 's rumpled “ Grip . ” Here is no semblance of the cawing rook that haunts ancestral turrets and treads the field of heraldry ; no boding phantom of which Tickell sang that , when ,</p>
   <p>“ shrieking at her window thrice , The raven flap 'd his wing , Too well the love-lorn maiden knew The solemn boding sound . ”</p>
   <p>Poe 's raven is a distinct conception ; the incarnation of a mourner 's agony and hopelessness ; a sable embodied Memory , the abiding chronicler of doom , a type of the Irreparable . Escaped across the Styx , from “ the Night 's Plutonian shore , ” he seems the imaged soul of the questioner himself ,— of him who can not , will not , quaff the kind nepenthe , because the memory of Lenore is all that is left him , and with the surcease of his sorrow even that would be put aside .</p>
   <p>The Raven also may be taken as a representative poem of its author , for its exemplification of all his notions of what a poem should be . These are found in his essays on “ The Poetic Principle , ” “ The Rationale of Verse , ” and “ The Philosophy of Composition . ” Poe declared that “ in Music , perhaps , the soul most nearly attains the great end for which , when inspired by the Poetic Sentiment , it struggles — the creation of supernal Beauty .... Verse cannot be better designated than as an inferior or less capable music ” ; but again , verse which is really the “ Poetry of Words ” is “ The Rhythmical Creation of Beauty , ” — this and nothing more . The tone of the highest Beauty is one of Sadness . The most melancholy of topics is Death . This must be allied to Beauty . “ The death , then , of a beautiful woman is , unquestionably , the most poetical topic in the world ,— and equally is it beyond doubt that the lips best suited for such a topic are those of a bereaved lover . ” These last expressions are quoted from Poe 's whimsical analysis of this very poem , but they indicate precisely the general range of his verse . The climax of “ The Bells ” is the muffled monotone of ghouls , who glory in weighing down the human heart . “ Lenore , ” The Raven , “ The Sleeper , ” “ To One in Paradise , ” and “ Ulalume ” form a tenebrose symphony ,— and “ Annabel Lee , ” written last of all , shows that one theme possessed him to the end . Again , these are all nothing if not musical , and some are touched with that quality of the Fantastic which awakes the sense of awe , and adds a new fear to agony itself . Through all is dimly outlined , beneath a shadowy pall , the poet 's ideal love ,— so often half-portrayed elsewhere ,— the entombed wife of Usher , the Lady Ligeia , in truth the counterpart of his own nature . I suppose that an artist 's love for one “ in the form ” never can wholly rival his devotion to some ideal . The woman near him must exercise her spells , be all by turns and nothing long , charm him with infinite variety , or be content to forego a share of his allegiance . He must be lured by the Unattainable , and this is ever just beyond him in his passion for creative art .</p>
   <p>Poe , like Hawthorne , came in with the decline of the Romantic school , and none delighted more than he to laugh at its calamity . Yet his heart was with the romancers and their Oriental or Gothic effects . His invention , so rich in the prose tales , seemed to desert him when he wrote verse ; and his judgment told him that long romantic poems depend more upon incident than inspiration ,— and that , to utter the poetry of romance , lyrics would suffice . Hence his theory , clearly fitted to his own limitations , that “ a ‘ long poem ’ is a flat contradiction in terms . ” The components of The Raven are few and simple : a man , a bird , and the phantasmal memory at a woman . But the piece affords a fine display of romantic material . What have we ? The midnight ; the shadowy chamber with its tomes of forgotten lore ; the student ,— a modern Hieronymus ; the raven 's tap on the casement ; the wintry night and dying fire ; the silken wind-swept hangings ; the dreams and vague mistrust of the echoing darkness ; the black , uncanny bird upon the pallid bust ; the accessories of violet velvet and the gloating lamp . All this stage effect of situation , light , color , sound , is purely romantic , and even melodramatic , but of a poetic quality that melodrama rarely exhibits , and thoroughly reflective of the poet 's “ eternal passion , eternal pain . ”</p>
   <p>The rhythmical structure of The Raven was sure to make an impression . Rhyme , alliteration , the burden , the stanzaic form , were devised with singular adroitness . Doubtless the poet was struck with the aptness of Miss Barrett 's musical trochaics , in “ eights , ” and especially by the arrangement adopted near the close of “ Lady Geraldine ":</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ ‘ Eyes , ’ he said , ‘ now throbbing through me ! Are ye eyes that did undo me ?</l>
     <l n="2">Shining eyes , like antique jewels set in Parian statue-stone !</l>
     <l n="3">Underneath that calm white forehead , are ye ever burning torrid</l>
     <l n="4">O'er the desolate sand-desert of my heart and life undone ? ’ ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>His artistic introduction of a third rhyme in both the second and fourth lines , and the addition of a fifth line and a final refrain , made the stanza of The Raven . The persistent alliteration seems to come without effort , and often the rhymes within lines are seductive ; while the refrain or burden dominates the whole work . Here also he had profited by Miss Barrett 's study of ballads and romaunts in her own and other tongues . A “ refrain ” is the lure wherewith a poet or a musician holds the wandering ear ,— the recurrent longing of Nature for the initial strain . I have always admired the beautiful refrains of the English songstress ,— “ The Nightingales , the Nightingales , ” “ Margret , Margret , ” “ My Heart and I , ” “ Toll slowly , ” “ The River floweth on , ” “ Pan , Pan is dead , ” etc . She also employed what I term the Repetend , in the use of which Poe has excelled all poets since Coleridge thus revived it :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ O happy living things ! no tongue</l>
     <l n="2">Their beauty might declare :</l>
     <l n="3">A spring of love gushed from my heart ,</l>
     <l n="4">And I blessed them unaware :</l>
     <l n="5">Sure my kind saint took pity on me ,</l>
     <l n="6">And I blessed them unaware . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Poe created the fifth line of his stanza for the magic of the repetend . He relied upon it to the uttermost in a few later poems ,— “ Lenore , ” “ Annabel Lee , ” “ Ulalume , ” and “ For Annie . ” It gained a wild and melancholy music , I have thought , from the “ sweet influences , ” of the Afric burdens and repetends that were sung to him in childhood , attuning with their native melody the voice of our Southern poet .</p>
   <p>“ The Philosophy of Composition , ” his analysis of The Raven , is a technical dissection of its method and structure . Neither his avowal of cold-blooded artifice , nor his subsequent avowal to friends that an exposure of this artifice was only another of his intellectual hoaxes , need be wholly credited . If he had designed the complete work in advance , he scarcely would have made so harsh a prelude of rattle-pan rhymes to the delicious melody of the second stanza ,— not even upon his theory of the fantastic . Of course an artist , having perfected a work , sees , like the first Artist , that it is good , and sees why it is good . A subsequent analysis , coupled with a disavowal of any sacred fire , readily enough may be made . My belief is that the first conception and rough draft of this poem came as inspiration always comes ; that its author then saw how it might be perfected , giving it the final touches described in his chapter on Composition , and that the latter , therefore , is neither wholly false nor wholly true . The harm of such analysis is that it tempts a novice to fancy that artificial processes can supersede imagination . The impulse of genius is to guard the secrets of its creative hour . Glimpses obtained of the toil , the baffled experiments , which precede a triumph , as in the sketch-work of Hawthorne recently brought to light , afford priceless instruction and encouragement to the sincere artist . But one who voluntarily exposes his Muse to the gaze of all comers should recall the fate of King Candaules .</p>
   <p>The world still thinks of Poe as a “ luckless man of genius . ” I recently heard him mentioned as “ one whom everybody seems chartered to misrepresent , decry or slander . ” But it seems to me that his ill-luck ended with his pitiable death , and that since then his defence has been persistent , and his fame of as steadfast growth as a suffering and gifted author could pray for in his hopeful hour . Griswold 's decrial and slander turned the current in his favor . Critics and biographers have come forward with successive refutations , with tributes to his character , with new editions of his works . His own letters and the minute incidents of his career are before us ; the record , good and bad , is widely known . No appellor has received more tender and forgiving judgement . His mishaps in life belonged to his region and period , perchance still more to his own infirmity of will . Doubtless his environment was not one to guard a fine-grained , ill-balanced nature from perils without and within . His strongest will , to be lord of himself , gained for him “ that heritage of woe . ” He confessed himself the bird 's unhappy master , the stricken sufferer of this poem . But his was a full share of that dramatic temper which exults in the presage of its own doom . There is a delight in playing one 's high part : we are all gladiators , crying Ave Imperator ! To quote Burke 's matter of fact : “ In grief the pleasure is still uppermost , and the affliction we suffer has no resemblance to absolute pain , which is always odious , and which we endeavor to shake off as soon as possible . ” Poe went farther , and was an artist even in the tragedy of his career . If , according to his own belief , sadness and the vanishing of beauty are the highest poetic themes , and poetic feeling the keenest earthly pleasure , then the sorrow and darkness of his broken life were not without their frequent compensation .</p>
   <p>In the following pages , we have a fresh example of an artist 's genius characterizing his interpretation of a famous poem . Gustave Doré , the last work of whose pencil is before us , was not the painter , or even the draughtsman , for realists demanding truth of tone , figure , and perfection . Such matters concerned him less than to make shape and distance , light and shade , assist his purpose ,— which was to excite the soul , the imagination , of the looker on . This he did by arousing our sense of awe , through marvellous and often sublime conceptions of things unutterable and full of gloom or glory . It is well said that if his works were not great paintings , as pictures they are great indeed . As a “ literary artist , ” and such he was , his force was in direct ratio with the dramatic invention of his author , with the brave audacities of the spirit that kindled his own . Hence his success with Rabelais , with “ Le Juif-Errant , ” “ Les Contes Drolatiques , ” and “ Don Quixote , ” and hence , conversely , his failure to express the beauty of Tennyson 's Idyls , of “ Il Paradiso , ” of the Hebrew pastorals , and other texts requiring exaltation , or sweetness and repose . He was a born master of the grotesque , and by a special insight could portray the spectres of a haunted brain . We see objects as his personages saw them , and with the very eyes of the Wandering Jew , the bewildered Don , or the goldsmith 's daughter whose fancy so magnifies the King in the shop on the Pont-au-Change . It was in the nature of things that he should be attracted to each masterpiece of verse or prose that I have termed unique . The lower kingdoms were called into his service ; his rocks , trees and mountains , the sky itself , are animate with motive and diablerie . Had he lived to illustrate Shakespeare , we should have seen a remarkable treatment of Caliban , the Witches , the storm in “ Lear ” ; but doubtless should have questioned his ideals of Imogen or Miranda . Beauty pure and simple , and the perfect excellence thereof , he rarely seemed to comprehend .</p>
   <p>Yet there is beauty in his designs for the “ Ancient Mariner , ” unreal as they are , and a consecutiveness rare in a series by Doré . The Rime afforded him a prolonged story , with many shiftings of the scene . In The Raven sound and color preserve their monotone and we have no change of place or occasion . What is the result ? Doré proffers a series of variations upon the theme as he conceived it , “ the enigma of death and the hallucination of an inconsolable soul . ” In some of these drawings his faults are evident ; others reveal his powerful originality , and the best qualities in which , as a draughtsman , he stood alone . Plainly there was something in common between the working moods of Poe and Doré . This would appear more clearly had the latter tried his hand upon the “ Tales of the Grotesque and Arabesque . ” Both resorted often to the elf-land of fantasy and romance . In melodramatic feats they both , through their command of the supernatural , avoided the danger-line between the ideal and the absurd . Poe was the truer worshipper of the Beautiful ; his love for it was a consecrating passion , and herein he parts company with his illustrator . Poet or artist , Death at last transfigures all : within the shadow of his sable harbinger , Vedder 's symbolic crayon aptly sets them face to face , but enfolds them with the mantle of immortal wisdom and power . An American woman has wrought the image of a star-eyed Genius with the final torch , the exquisite semblance of one whose vision beholds , but whose lips may not utter , the mysteries of a land beyond “ the door of a legended tomb . ”</p>

     <l n="2">Once upon a midnight dreary , while I pondered , weak and weary ,</l>
     <l n="3">Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore ,</l>
     <l n="4">While I nodded , nearly napping , suddenly there came a tapping ,</l>
     <l n="5">As of some one gently rapping , rapping at my chamber door .</l>
     <l n="6">“ ‘ T is some visiter , ” I muttered , “ tapping at my chamber door —</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="8">Ah , distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December ,</l>
     <l n="9">And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor .</l>
     <l n="10">Eagerly I wished the morrow :— vainly I had sought to borrow</l>
     <l n="11">From my books surcease of sorrow — sorrow for the lost Lenore —</l>

     <l n="13">Nameless here for evermore .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="14">And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain</l>
     <l n="15">Thrilled me — filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before ;</l>
     <l n="16">So that now , to still the beating of my heart , I stood repeating</l>
     <l n="17">“ ‘ T is some visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door</l>
     <l n="18">Some late visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door ;—</l>

     <l n="28">But the silence was unbroken , and the darkness gave no token ,</l>
     <l n="29">And the only word there spoken was the whispered word , “ Lenore ! ”</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="32">Back into the chamber turning , all my soul within me burning ,</l>
     <l n="33">Soon again I heard a tapping , somewhat louder than before .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="38">Open here I flung the shutter , when , with many a flirt and flutter ,</l>
     <l n="39">In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore .</l>
     <l n="40">Not the least obeisance made he ; not a minute stopped or stayed he ;</l>
     <l n="41">But , with mien of lord or lady , perched above my chamber door —</l>
     <l n="42">Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door —</l>
     <l n="43">Perched , and sat , and nothing more .</l>

     <l n="58">Nothing further then he uttered — not a feather then he fluttered —</l>
     <l n="59">Till I scarcely more than muttered , “ Other friends have flown before —</l>
     <l n="60">On the morrow he will leave me , as my hopes have flown before . ”</l>
