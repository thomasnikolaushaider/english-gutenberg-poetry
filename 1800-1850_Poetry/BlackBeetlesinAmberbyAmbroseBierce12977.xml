   <p>A WREATH OF IMMORTELLES</p>
   <p>IN EXPLANATION</p>
   <p>Many of the verses in this book are republished , with considerable alterations , from various newspapers . The collection includes few not relating to persons and events more or less familiar to the people of the Pacific Coast — to whom the volume may be considered as especially addressed , though , not without a hope that some part of the contents may be found to have sufficient intrinsic interest to commend it to others . In that case , doubtless , commentators will be “ raised up ” to make exposition of its full meaning , with possibly an added meaning read into it by themselves .</p>
   <p>Of my motives in writing , and in now republishing , I do not care to make either defense or explanation , except with reference to those persons who since my first censure of them have passed away . To one having only a reader 's interest in the matter it may easily seem that the verses relating to those might more properly have been omitted from this collection . But if these pieces , or , indeed , if any considerable part of my work in literature , have the intrinsic worth which by this attempt to preserve some of it I have assumed , their permanent suppression is impossible , and it is only a question of when and by whom they shall be republished . Some one will surely search them out and put them in circulation .</p>
   <p>I conceive it the right of an author to have his fugitive work collected in his lifetime ; and this seems to me especially true of one whose work , necessarily engendering animosities , is peculiarly exposed to challenge as unjust . That is a charge that can be best examined before time has effaced the evidence . For the death of a man of whom I may have written what I venture to think worthy to live I am no way responsible ; and , however sincerely I may regret it , I can hardly be expected to consent that it shall affect my fortunes . If the satirist who does not accept the remarkable doctrine that while condemning the sin he should spare the sinner were bound to let the life of his work be coterminous with that of his subject his were a lot of peculiar hardship .</p>
   <p>Persuaded of the validity of all this , I have not hesitated to reprint even certain “ epitaphs ” which , once of the living , are now of the dead , as all the others must eventually be . The objection inheres in all forms of applied satire — my understanding of whose laws and liberties is at least derived from reverent study of the masters . That in respect of matters herein mentioned I have but followed their practice can be shown by abundant instance and example .</p>

    <head>THE KEY NOTE</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">I dreamed I was dreaming one morn as I lay</l>
     <l n="2">In a garden with flowers teeming .</l>
     <l n="3">On an island I lay in a mystical bay ,</l>
     <l n="4">In the dream that I dreamed I was dreaming .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">The ghost of a scent — had it followed me there</l>
     <l n="6">From the place where I truly was resting ?</l>
     <l n="7">It filled like an anthem the aisles of the air ,</l>
     <l n="8">The presence of roses attesting .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">Yet I thought in the dream that I dreamed I dreamed</l>
     <l n="10">That the place was all barren of roses —</l>
     <l n="11">That it only seemed ; and the place , I deemed ,</l>
     <l n="12">Was the Isle of Bewildered Noses .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">Full many a seaman had testified</l>
     <l n="14">How all who sailed near were enchanted ,</l>
     <l n="15">And landed to search ( and in searching died )</l>
     <l n="16">For the roses the Sirens had planted .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="17">For the Sirens were dead , and the billows boomed</l>
     <l n="18">In the stead of their singing forever ;</l>
     <l n="19">But the roses bloomed on the graves of the doomed ,</l>
     <l n="20">Though man had discovered them never .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="21">I thought in my dream ‘ twas an idle tale ,</l>
     <l n="22">A delusion that mariners cherished —</l>
     <l n="23">That the fragrance loading the conscious gale</l>
     <l n="24">Was the ghost of a rose long perished .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="25">I said , “ I will fly from this island of woes . ”</l>
     <l n="26">And acting on that decision ,</l>
     <l n="27">By that odor of rose I was led by the nose ,</l>
     <l n="28">For ‘ twas truly , ah ! truly , Elysian .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="29">I ran , in my madness , to seek out the source</l>
     <l n="30">Of the redolent river — directed</l>
     <l n="31">By some supernatural , sinister force</l>
     <l n="32">To a forest , dark , haunted , infected .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="33">And still as I threaded ( ‘ twas all in the dream</l>
     <l n="34">That I dreamed I was dreaming ) each turning</l>
     <l n="35">There were many a scream and a sudden gleam</l>
     <l n="36">Of eyes all uncannily burning !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="37">The leaves were all wet with a horrible dew</l>
     <l n="38">That mirrored the red moon 's crescent ,</l>
     <l n="39">And all shapes were fringed with a ghostly blue ,</l>
     <l n="40">Dim , wavering , phosphorescent .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="41">But the fragrance divine , coming strong and free ,</l>
     <l n="42">Led me on , though my blood was clotting ,</l>
     <l n="43">Till — ah , joy !— I could see , on the limbs of a tree ,</l>
     <l n="44">Mine enemies hanging and rotting !</l>

     <l n="1">Lord , shed thy light upon his desert path ,</l>
     <l n="2">And gild his branded brow , that no man spill</l>
     <l n="3">His forfeit life to balk thy holy will</l>
     <l n="4">That spares him for the ripening of wrath .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">Already , lo ! the red sign is descried ,</l>
     <l n="6">To trembling jurors visibly revealed :</l>
     <l n="7">The prison doors obediently yield ,</l>
     <l n="8">The baffled hangman flings the cord aside .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">Powell , the brother 's blood that marks your trail —</l>
     <l n="10">Hark , how it cries against you from the ground ,</l>
     <l n="11">Like the far baying of the tireless hound .</l>
     <l n="12">Faith ! to your ear it is no nightingale .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">What signifies the date upon a stone ?</l>
     <l n="14">To-morrow you shall die if not to-day .</l>
     <l n="15">What matter when the Avenger choose to slay</l>
     <l n="16">Or soon or late the Devil gets his own .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="17">Thenceforth through all eternity you 'll hold</l>
     <l n="18">No one advantage of the later death .</l>
     <l n="19">Though you had granted Ralph another breath</l>
     <l n="20">Would he to-day less silent lie and cold ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="21">Earth cares not , curst assassin , when you die ;</l>
     <l n="22">You never will be readier than now .</l>
     <l n="23">Wear , in God 's name , that mark upon your brow ,</l>
     <l n="24">And keep the life you purchased with a lie !</l>

    <head>AN OBITUARIAN</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Death-poet Pickering sat at his desk ,</l>
     <l n="2">Wrapped in appropriate gloom ;</l>
     <l n="3">His posture was pensive and picturesque ,</l>
     <l n="4">Like a raven charming a tomb .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">Enter a party a-drinking the cup</l>
     <l n="6">Of sorrow — and likewise of woe :</l>
     <l n="7">“ Some harrowing poetry , Mister , whack up ,</l>
     <l n="8">All wrote in the key of O .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">“ For the angels has called my old woman hence</l>
     <l n="10">From the strife ( where she fit mighty free ) .</l>
     <l n="11">It 's a nickel a line ? Cond — n the expense !</l>
     <l n="12">For wealth is now little to me . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">The Bard of Mortality looked him through</l>
     <l n="14">In the piercingest sort of a way :</l>
     <l n="15">“ It is much to me though it 's little to you —</l>
     <l n="16">I 've taken a wife to-day . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="17">So he twisted the tail of his mental cow</l>
     <l n="18">And made her give down her flow .</l>
     <l n="19">The grief of that bard was long-winded , somehow —</l>
     <l n="20">There was reams and reamses of woe .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="21">The widower man which had buried his wife</l>
     <l n="22">Grew lily-like round each gill ,</l>
     <l n="23">For she turned in her grave and came back to life —</l>
     <l n="24">Then he cruel ignored the bill !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="25">Then Sorrow she opened her gates a-wide ,</l>
     <l n="26">As likewise did also Woe ,</l>
     <l n="27">And the death-poet 's song , as is heard inside ,</l>

    <head>A COMMUTED SENTENCE</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Boruck and Waterman upon their grills</l>
     <l n="2">In Hades lay , with many a sigh and groan ,</l>
     <l n="3">Hotly disputing , for each swore his own</l>
     <l n="4">Were clearly keener than the other 's ills .</l>
     <l n="5">And , truly , each had much to boast of — bone</l>
     <l n="6">And sinew , muscle , tallow , nerve and skin ,</l>
     <l n="7">Blood in the vein and marrow in the shin ,</l>
     <l n="8">Teeth , eyes and other organs ( for the soul</l>
     <l n="9">Has all of these and even a wagging chin )</l>
     <l n="10">Blazing and coruscating like a coal !</l>
     <l n="11">For Lower Sacramento , you remember ,</l>
     <l n="12">Has trying weather , even in mid-December .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="13">Now this occurred in the far future . All</l>
     <l n="14">Mankind had been a million ages dead ,</l>
     <l n="15">And each to her reward above had sped ,</l>
     <l n="16">Each to his punishment below ,— I call</l>
     <l n="17">That quite a just arrangement . As I said ,</l>
     <l n="18">Boruck and Waterman in warmest pain</l>
     <l n="19">Crackled and sizzed with all their might and main .</l>
     <l n="20">For , when on earth , they 'd freed a scurvy host</l>
     <l n="21">Of crooks from the State prison , who again</l>
     <l n="22">Had robbed and ravaged the Pacific Coast</l>
     <l n="23">And ( such the felon 's predatory nature )</l>
     <l n="24">Even got themselves into the Legislature .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="25">So Waterman and Boruck lay and roared</l>
     <l n="26">In Hades . It is true all other males</l>
     <l n="27">Felt the like flames and uttered equal wails ,</l>
     <l n="28">But did not suffer them ; whereas they bored</l>
     <l n="29">Each one the other . But indeed my tale 's</l>
     <l n="30">Not getting on at all . They lay and browned</l>
     <l n="31">Till Boruck ( who long since his teeth had ground</l>
     <l n="32">Away and spoke Gum Arabic and made</l>
     <l n="33">Stump speeches even in praying ) looked around</l>
     <l n="34">And said to Bob 's incinerated shade :</l>
     <l n="35">“ Your Excellency , this is mighty hard on</l>
     <l n="36">The inventors of the unpardonable pardon . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="37">The other soul — his right hand all aflame ,</l>
     <l n="38">For ‘ twas with that he 'd chiefly sinned , although</l>
     <l n="39">His tongue , too , like a wick was working woe</l>
     <l n="40">To the reserve of tallow in his frame —</l>
     <l n="41">Said , with a sputtering , uncertain flow ,</l>
     <l n="42">And with a gesture like a shaken torch :</l>
     <l n="43">“ Yes , but I 'm sure we 'll not much longer scorch .</l>
     <l n="44">Although this climate is not good for Hope ,</l>
     <l n="45">Whose joyous wing ‘ twould singe , I think the porch</l>
     <l n="46">Of Hell we 'll quit with a pacific slope .</l>
     <l n="47">Last century I signified repentance</l>
     <l n="48">And asked for commutation of our sentence . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="49">Even as he spoke , the form of Satan loomed</l>
     <l n="50">In sight , all crimson with reflections 's fire ,</l>
     <l n="51">Like some tall tower or cathedral spire</l>
     <l n="52">Touched by the dawn while all the earth is gloomed</l>
     <l n="53">In mists and shadows of the night time . “ Sire , ”</l>
     <l n="54">Said Waterman , his agitable wick</l>
     <l n="55">Still sputtering , “ what calls you back so quick ?</l>
     <l n="56">It scarcely was a century ago</l>
     <l n="57">You left us . ” “ I have come to bring , ” said Nick ,</l>
     <l n="58">“ St. Peter 's answer ( he is never slow</l>
     <l n="59">In correspondence ) to your application</l>
     <l n="60">For pardon — pardon me !— for commutation .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="61">“ He says that he 's instructed to reply</l>
     <l n="62">( And he has so instructed me ) that sin</l>
     <l n="63">Like yours — and this poor gentleman 's who 's in</l>
     <l n="64">For bad advice to you — comes rather high ;</l>
     <l n="65">But since , apparently , you both begin</l>
     <l n="66">To feel some pious promptings to the right ,</l>
     <l n="67">And fain would turn your faces to the light ,</l>
     <l n="68">Eternity seems all too long a term .</l>
     <l n="69">So ‘ tis commuted to one-half . I 'm quite</l>
     <l n="70">Prepared , when that expires , to free the worm</l>
     <l n="71">And quench the fire . ” And , civilly retreating ,</l>
     <l n="72">He left them holding their protracted meeting .</l>

    <head>TWO STATESMEN</head>
     <l n="1">In that fair city by the inland sea ,</l>
     <l n="2">Where Blaine unhived his Presidential bee ,</l>
     <l n="3">Frank Pixley 's meeting with George Gorham sing ,</l>
     <l n="4">Celestial muse , and what events did spring</l>
     <l n="5">From the encounter of those mighty sons</l>
     <l n="6">Of thunder , and of slaughter , and of guns .</l>
     <l n="7">Great Gorham first , his yearning tooth to sate</l>
     <l n="8">And give him stomach for the day 's debate ,</l>
     <l n="9">Entering a restaurant , with eager mien ,</l>
     <l n="10">Demands an ounce of bacon and a bean .</l>
     <l n="11">The trembling waiter , by the statesman 's eye</l>
     <l n="12">Smitten with terror , hastens to comply ;</l>
     <l n="13">Nor chairs nor tables can his speed retard ,</l>
     <l n="14">For famine 's fixed and horrible regard</l>
     <l n="15">He takes for menace . As he shaking flew ,</l>
     <l n="16">Lo ! the portentous Pixley heaved in view !</l>
     <l n="17">Before him yawned invisible the cell ,</l>
     <l n="18">Unheard , behind , the warden 's footsteps fell .</l>
     <l n="19">Thrice in convention rising to his feet ,</l>
     <l n="20">He thrice had been thrust back into his seat ;</l>
     <l n="21">Thrice had protested , been reminded thrice</l>
     <l n="22">The nation had no need of his advice .</l>
     <l n="23">Balked of his will to set the people right ,</l>
     <l n="24">His soul was gloomy though his hat was white ,</l>
     <l n="25">So fierce his mien , with provident accord</l>
     <l n="26">The waiters swarmed him , thinking him a lord .</l>
     <l n="27">He spurned them , roaring grandly to their chief :</l>
     <l n="28">“ Give me ( Fred . Crocker pays ) a leg of beef ! ”</l>
     <l n="29">His wandering eye 's deluminating flame</l>
     <l n="30">Fell upon Gorham and the crisis came !</l>
     <l n="31">For Pixley scowled and darkness filled the room</l>
     <l n="32">Till Gorham 's flashing orbs dispelled the gloom .</l>
     <l n="33">The patrons of the place , by fear dismayed ,</l>
     <l n="34">Sprang to the street and left their scores unpaid .</l>
     <l n="35">So , when Jove thunders and his lightnings gleam</l>
     <l n="36">To sour the milk and curdle , too , the cream ,</l>
     <l n="37">And storm-clouds gather on the shadowed hill ,</l>
     <l n="38">The ass forsakes his hay , the pig his swill .</l>
     <l n="39">Hotly the heroes now engaged — their breath</l>
     <l n="40">Came short and hard , as in the throes of death .</l>
     <l n="41">They clenched their hands , their weapons brandished high ,</l>
     <l n="42">Cut , stabbed , and hewed , nor uttered any cry ,</l>
     <l n="43">But gnashed their teeth and struggled on ! In brief ,</l>
     <l n="44">One ate his bacon , t'other one his beef .</l>

      <l n="1">Sharon , ambitious of immortal shame ,</l>
      <l n="2">Fame 's dead-wall daubed with his illustrious name —</l>
      <l n="3">Served in the Senate , for our sins , his time ,</l>
      <l n="4">Each word a folly and each vote a crime ;</l>
      <l n="5">Law for our governance well skilled to make</l>
      <l n="6">By knowledge gained in study how to break ;</l>
      <l n="7">Yet still by the presiding eye ignored ,</l>
      <l n="8">Which only sought him when too loud he snored .</l>
      <l n="9">Auspicious thunder !— when he woke to vote</l>
      <l n="10">He stilled his own to cut his country 's throat ;</l>
      <l n="11">That rite performed , fell off again to sleep ,</l>
      <l n="12">While statesmen ages dead awoke to weep !</l>
      <l n="13">For sedentary service all unfit ,</l>
      <l n="14">By lying long disqualified to sit ,</l>

      <l n="20">His sovereign State has still the final word :</l>

      <l n="24">And close with stormy clamor the debate .</l>
      <l n="25">To low melodious thunders then they fade ;</l>
      <l n="26">Their murmuring lullabies all ears invade ;</l>
      <l n="27">Peace takes the Chair ; the portal Silence keeps ;</l>

      <l n="78">Augments the debits in the long account .</l>
      <l n="79">And still the continents and oceans ring</l>

     <l n="10">With mingled admiration and alarm —</l>
     <l n="11">The brook that runs by many a scandal-mill ,</l>
     <l n="12">The church whose pastor groans upon the grill ,</l>
     <l n="13">The cowthorn bush with seats beneath the shade ,</l>
     <l n="14">Where hearts are struck and reputations flayed ;</l>
     <l n="15">How often wished thine idle wives , some day ,</l>
     <l n="16">Might more at whist , less at the devil , play .</l>

     <l n="20">Finds in a wolf-den greater peace and ease ;</l>
     <l n="21">Who quits the place whence truth did earlier fly ,</l>
     <l n="22">And rather than come back prefers to die !</l>
     <l n="23">For her no jealous maids renounce their sleep ,</l>
     <l n="24">Contriving malices to make her weep ;</l>
     <l n="25">No iron-faced dames her character debate</l>
     <l n="26">And spurn imploring mercy from the gate ;</l>
     <l n="27">But down she lies to a more peaceful end ,</l>
     <l n="28">For wolves do not calumniate , but rend —</l>
     <l n="29">Sinks piecemeal to their maws , a willing prey ,</l>
     <l n="30">While resignation lubricates the way ,</l>
     <l n="31">And all her prospects brighten at the last :</l>
     <l n="32">To wolves , not women , an approved repast .</l>

    <head>THE WOFUL TALE OF MR. PETERS</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">I should like , good friends , to mention the disaster which befell</l>
     <l n="2">Mr. William Perry Peters , of the town of Muscatel ,</l>
     <l n="3">Whose fate is full of meaning , if correctly understood —</l>
     <l n="4">Admonition to the haughty , consolation to the good .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">It happened in the hot snap which we recently incurred ,</l>
     <l n="6">When ‘ twas warm enough to carbonize the feathers of a bird ,</l>
     <l n="7">And men exclaimed : “ By Hunky ! ” who were bad enough to swear ,</l>
     <l n="8">And pious persons supervised their adjectives with care .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">Mr. Peters was a pedagogue of honor and repute ,</l>
     <l n="10">His learning comprehensive , multifarious , minute .</l>
     <l n="11">It was commonly conceded in the section whence he came</l>
     <l n="12">That the man who played against him needed knowledge of the game .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">And some there were who whispered , in the town of Muscatel ,</l>
     <l n="14">That besides the game of Draw he knew Orthography as well ;</l>
     <l n="15">Though , the school directors , frigidly contemning that as stuff ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="17">Withal , he was a haughty man — indubitably great ,</l>

     <l n="19">His mien was contumelious to men of lesser gift :</l>

     <l n="27">But Providence disposes , be our scheming what it may ,</l>
     <l n="28">And disposed of Mr. Peters in a cold , regardless way .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="29">It occurred in San Francisco , whither Mr. Peters came</l>
     <l n="30">In the cause of Education , feeling still the holy flame</l>
     <l n="31">Of ambition to assist in lifting up the human mind</l>
     <l n="32">To a higher plane of knowledge than its Architect designed .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="33">He attended the convention of the pedagogic host ;</l>
     <l n="34">He was first in the Pavilion , he was last to leave his post .</l>
     <l n="35">For days and days he narrowly observed the Chairman 's eye ,</l>
     <l n="36">His efforts ineffectual to catch it on the fly .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="37">The blessed moment came at last : the Chairman tipped his head .</l>
     <l n="38">“ The gentleman from ah — um — er , ” that functionary said .</l>
     <l n="39">The gentleman from ah — um — er reflected with a grin :</l>

     <l n="45">For he felt himself the focus of non-Muscatelish eyes ,</l>

     <l n="47">As with pitiless impaction all their heat-waves on him broke</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="49">“ Put him out ! ” cried all in chorus ; but the meaning was n't clear</l>
     <l n="50">Of that succoring suggestion to his obfuscated ear ;</l>
     <l n="51">And it notably augmented his incinerating glow</l>
     <l n="52">To regard himself excessive , or in any way de trop .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="53">Gone was all his wild ambition to lift up the human mind !—</l>
     <l n="54">Gone the words he would have uttered !— gone the thought that lay behind !</l>
     <l n="55">For “ words that burn ” may be consumed in a superior flame ,</l>
     <l n="56">And “ thoughts that breathe ” may breathe their last , and die a death of shame .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="57">He 'd known himself a shining light , but never had he known</l>
     <l n="58">Himself so very luminous as now he knew he shone .</l>
     <l n="59">“ A pillar , I , of fire , ” he 'd said , “ to guide my race will be ; ”</l>
     <l n="60">And now that very inconvenient thing to him was he .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="61">He stood there all irresolute ; the seconds went and came ;</l>
     <l n="62">The minutes passed and did but add fresh fuel to his flame .</l>
     <l n="63">How long he stood he knew not — ‘ twas a century or more —</l>
     <l n="64">And then that incandescent man levanted for the door !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="65">He darted like a comet from the building to the street ,</l>
     <l n="66">Where Fahrenheit attested ninety-five degrees of heat .</l>
     <l n="67">Vicissitudes of climate make the tenure of the breath</l>
     <l n="68">Precarious , and William Perry Peters froze to death !</l>

     <l n="20">He smiled a dark , portentous smile ;</l>

   <p>Dear man ! although a stranger and a foe To soft affection 's humanizing glow ; Although untaught how manly hearts may throb With more desires than the desire to rob ; Although as void of tenderness as wit , And owning nothing soft but Maurice Schmitt ; Although polluted , shunned and in disgrace , You fill me with a passion to embrace ! Attentive to your look , your smile , your beck , I watch and wait to fall upon your neck . Lord of my love , and idol of my hope , You are my Valentine , and I 'm A ROPE .</p>
