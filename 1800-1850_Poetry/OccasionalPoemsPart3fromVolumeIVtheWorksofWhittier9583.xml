    <docDate>Oh , for faith like thine , sweet Eva , Lighting all the solemn river , And the blessings of the poor Wafting to the heavenly shore !<date>1852</date>A LAY OF OLD TIME .</docDate>
    <docImprint>Written for the Essex County Agricultural Fair , and sung at the banquet at Newburyport , October 2 ,<date>1856</date>. One morning of the first sad Fall , Poor Adam and his bride Sat in the shade of Eden 's wall — But on the outer side . She , blushing in her fig-leaf suit For the chaste garb of old ; He , sighing o'er his bitter fruit For Eden 's drupes of gold . Behind them , smiling in the morn , Their forfeit garden lay , Before them , wild with rock and thorn , The desert stretched away . They heard the air above them fanned , A light step on the sward , And lo ! they saw before them stand The angel of the Lord ! “ Arise , ” he said , “ why look behind , When hope is all before , And patient hand and willing mind , Your loss may yet restore ? “ I leave with you a spell whose power Can make the desert glad , And call around you fruit and flower As fair as Eden had . “ I clothe your hands with power to lift The curse from off your soil ; Your very doom shall seem a gift , Your loss a gain through Toil .</docImprint>
    <epigraph>
     <p>“ Go , cheerful as yon humming-bees , To labor as to play . ” White glimmering over Eden 's trees The angel passed away . The pilgrims of the world went forth Obedient to the word , And found where'er they tilled the earth A garden of the Lord ! The thorn-tree cast its evil fruit And blushed with plum and pear , And seeded grass and trodden root Grew sweet beneath their care . We share our primal parents ’ fate , And , in our turn and day , Look back on Eden 's sworded gate As sad and lost as they . But still for us his native skies The pitying Angel leaves , And leads through Toil to Paradise New Adams and new Eves !</p>

      <head>KENOZA LAKE .</head>
      <head>This beautiful lake in East Haverhill was the “ Great Pond ” the writer 's boyhood . In 1859 a movement was made for improving its shores as a public park . At the opening of the park , August 31 , 1859 , the poem which gave it the name of Kenoza ( in Indian language signifying Pickerel ) was read .</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">As Adam did in Paradise ,</l>

       <l n="13">The shores we trod as barefoot boys ,</l>

      <head>OUR RIVER .</head>
      <head>FOR A SUMMER FESTIVAL AT “ THE LAURELS ” ON THE MERRIMAC .</head>
      <head>Jean Pierre Brissot , the famous leader of the Girondist party in the French Revolution , when a young man travelled extensively in the United States . He visited the valley of the Merrimac , and speaks in terms of admiration of the view from Moulton 's hill opposite Amesbury . The “ Laurel Party ” so called , as composed of ladies and gentlemen in the lower valley of the Merrimac , and invited friends and guests in other sections of the country . Its thoroughly enjoyable annual festivals were held in the early summer on the pine-shaded , laurel-blossomed slopes of the Newbury side of the river opposite Pleasant Valley in Amesbury . The several poems called out by these gatherings are here printed in sequence .</head>

     <p>I . Our fathers ’ God ! from out whose hand The centuries fall like grains of sand , We meet to-day , united , free , And loyal to our land and Thee , To thank Thee for the era done , And trust Thee for the opening one .</p>
     <p>II . Here , where of old , by Thy design , The fathers spake that word of Thine Whose echo is the glad refrain Of rended bolt and falling chain , To grace our festal time , from all The zones of earth our guests we call .</p>
     <p>III . Be with us while the New World greets The Old World thronging all its streets , Unveiling all the triumphs won By art or toil beneath the sun ; And unto common good ordain This rivalship of hand and brain .</p>
     <p>IV . Thou , who hast here in concord furled The war flags of a gathered world , Beneath our Western skies fulfil The Orient 's mission of good-will , And , freighted with love 's Golden Fleece , Send back its Argonauts of peace .</p>
     <p>V. For art and labor met in truce , For beauty made the bride of use , We thank Thee ; but , withal , we crave The austere virtues strong to save , The honor proof to place or gold , The manhood never bought nor sold .</p>
     <p>VI . Oh make Thou us , through centuries long , In peace secure , in justice strong ; Around our gift of freedom draw The safeguards of Thy righteous law And , cast in some diviner mould , Let the new cycle shame the old !</p>

      <docDate>Outbound , your bark awaits you . Were I one Whose prayer availeth much , my wish should be Your favoring trade-wind and consenting sea . By sail or steed was never love outrun , And , here or there , love follows her in whom All graces and sweet charities unite , The old Greek beauty set in holier light ; And her for whom New England 's byways bloom , Who walks among us welcome as the Spring , Calling up blossoms where her light feet stray . God keep you both , make beautiful your way , Comfort , console , and bless ; and safely bring , Ere yet I make upon a vaster sea The unreturning voyage , my friends to me .<date>1882</date>.</docDate>
