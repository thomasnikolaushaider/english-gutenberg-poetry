    <docTitle><titlePart>Pike County Ballads and other poems in this volume by Colonel John Hay represent in the best manner the spirit of our strong and independent sister-land across the Atlantic . Pike County Ballads do full justice to the raw material in the United States , and show a loyal temper in the rough . The other pieces show how the love of freedom speaks through finer spirits of the land , and , dealing with realities , can turn a life of action into music . Colonel Hay has lived always in vigorous relation with the full life of the people whose best mind his poems represent . He is descended from a Scottish soldier , a John Hay , who , at the beginning of the last century , left his country to take service under the Elector-Palatine , and whose son went afterwards with his family to settle among the Kentucky pioneers . Dr. Charles Hay was the father of John Hay the poet , who was born on the 8th of October 1838 , in the heart of the United States , at Salem in Indiana . When twenty years old he graduated at the neighbouring Brown University , where his fellow-students valued his skill as a writer . Then he studied for the Bar , and he was called to the Bar three years later , at Springfield , Illinois . At Springfield , Abraham Lincoln practised as a barrister . Shrewd , lively , earnest , honest , he grudged help to a rogue . In a criminal case , when evidence threw unexpected light upon a client 's character , Abraham Lincoln said suddenly to his junior , “ Swett , the man is guilty ; you defend him , I can n't . ” In another case , when a piece of rascality in his client came out , Abraham Lincoln left his junior in possession of the case and went to his hotel . To the judge , who sent for him , he replied that he had found his hands were very dirty , and had gone away to get them clean . Almost immediately after John Hay 's call to the Bar at Springfield he was chosen by Abraham Lincoln , newly made President , to go with him to Washington . At Washington , Hay acted as Assistant-Secretary , and was also , in the Civil War , aide-de-camp to President Lincoln . Throughout that momentous struggle he was actively employed on the side of the North at the headquarters and on the field of battle . He served for a time under Generals Hunter and Gillmore , became a Colonel in the army of the North , and served also as Assistant Adjutant-General . John Hay had in that struggle three brothers and two brothers-in-law serving also in the field . In 1890 there was published , in ten volumes , at New York , by the New York Century Company , “ Abraham Lincoln , a History : by John G. Nicolay and John Hay . ” This was , with fresh material inserted , a collection of chapters that had been published in The Century Magazine from November 1886 to the beginning of 1890 . The friends , who worked equally together upon this large record , said , “ We knew Mr. Lincoln intimately before his election to the Presidency . We came from Illinois to Washington with him , and remained at his side and in his service — separately or together - - until the day of his death . ”</titlePart></docTitle>
    <docImprint>Abroad , as at home , Colonel Hay has been active in the service of his country . In<date>1865</date>he went to<settlement>Paris</settlement>as Secretary of Legation , and after remaining two years in that office he went as Charge-d'Affaires for the<country>United States</country>to Vienna . After a year at Vienna , Colonel Hay went to<settlement>Madrid</settlement>as Secretary of Legation under General Daniel Sickles . In<date>1870</date>he returned to the<country>United States</country>, and was for the next five years an editorial writer for the<settlement>New York</settlement>Tribune . During seven months , when Whitelaw Reid was in Europe , Colonel Hay was editor in chief . It was for The Tribune that Hay wrote “ The Pike County Ballads , ” which were first reprinted separately in<date>1871</date>, and are placed first in the collection of his poems . In the same year he published his “ Castilian Days , ” inspired by residence in<country>Spain</country>. In<date>1876</date>Colonel Hay removed from<settlement>New York</settlement>to Cleveland , Ohio . He then ceased to take part in the editing of The Tribune , but continued friendly service as a writer . From<date>1879</date>to<date>1881</date>Colonel Hay served under President Hayes as Assistant-Secretary of State in the Government of the<country>United States</country>. In<date>1881</date>he was President of the International Sanitary Congress at Washington . Since that time he has been active , with John G. Nicolay , in the preparation and production of the full Memoir of Abraham Lincoln , now completed , that will take high rank among the records of a war which , in its issues , touched the future of the world , perhaps , more nearly than any war since Waterloo , not even excepting the great struggle which ended at Sedan . That is the life of a man , here is its music . H. M .</docImprint>

     <l n="2">Becase he do n't live , you see ;</l>
     <l n="3">Leastways , he 's got out of the habit</l>
     <l n="4">Of livin ’ like you and me .</l>
     <l n="5">Whar have you been for the last three year</l>
     <l n="6">That you have n't heard folks tell</l>
     <l n="7">How Jimmy Bludso passed in his checks</l>
     <l n="8">The night of the Prairie Belle ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">He were n't no saint ,— them engineers</l>
     <l n="10">Is all pretty much alike , -</l>
     <l n="11">One wife in Natchez-under-the-Hill ,</l>
     <l n="12">And another one here , in Pike ;</l>
     <l n="13">A keerless man in his talk was Jim ,</l>
     <l n="14">And an awkward hand in a row ,</l>
     <l n="15">But he never flunked , and he never lied , -</l>
     <l n="16">I reckon he never knowed how .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="17">And this was all the religion he had , -</l>
     <l n="18">To treat his engine well ;</l>
     <l n="19">Never be passed on the river ;</l>
     <l n="20">To mind the pilot 's bell ;</l>
     <l n="21">And if ever the Prairie Belle took fire , -</l>
     <l n="22">A thousand times he swore ,</l>
     <l n="23">He 'd hold her nozzle agin the bank</l>
     <l n="24">Till the last soul got ashore .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="25">All boats has their day on the Mississip ,</l>
     <l n="26">And her day come at last , -</l>
     <l n="27">The Movastar was a better boat ,</l>
     <l n="28">But the Belle she WOULDN'T be passed .</l>
     <l n="29">And so she come tearin ’ along that night -</l>
     <l n="30">The oldest craft on the line -</l>
     <l n="31">With a nigger squat on her safety-valve ,</l>
     <l n="32">And her furnace crammed , rosin and pine .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="33">The fire bust out as she clared the bar ,</l>
     <l n="34">And burnt a hole in the night ,</l>
     <l n="35">And quick as a flash she turned , and made</l>
     <l n="36">For that willer-bank on the right .</l>
     <l n="37">There was runnin ’ and cursin ’ , but Jim yelled out ,</l>
     <l n="38">Over all the infernal roar ,</l>
     <l n="39">“ I 'll hold her nozzle agin the bank</l>
     <l n="40">Till the last galoot 's ashore . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="41">Through the hot , black breath of the burnin ’ boat</l>
     <l n="42">Jim Bludso 's voice was heard ,</l>
     <l n="43">And they all had trust in his cussedness ,</l>
     <l n="44">And knowed he would keep his word .</l>
     <l n="45">And , sure 's you 're born , they all got off</l>
     <l n="46">Afore the smokestacks fell , -</l>
     <l n="47">And Bludso 's ghost went up alone</l>
     <l n="48">In the smoke of the Prairie Belle .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="49">He were n't no saint ,— but at jedgment</l>
     <l n="50">I 'd run my chance with Jim ,</l>
     <l n="51">‘ Longside of some pious gentlemen</l>
     <l n="52">That would n't shook hands with him .</l>
     <l n="53">He seen his duty , a dead-sure thing , -</l>
     <l n="54">And went for it thar and then ;</l>
     <l n="55">And Christ ai n't a-going to be too hard</l>
     <l n="56">On a man that died for men .</l>

     <l n="5">I do n't pan out on the prophets</l>
     <l n="6">And free-will , and that sort of thing , -</l>

     <l n="19">I went in for a jug of molasses</l>
     <l n="20">And left the team at the door .</l>
     <l n="21">They scared at something and started , -</l>
     <l n="22">I heard one little squall ,</l>

   <p>THE SURRENDER OF SPAIN .</p>
   <p>I . Land of unconquered Pelayo ! land of the Cid Campeador ! Sea-girdled mother of men ! Spain , name of glory and power ; Cradle of world-grasping Emperors , grave of the reckless invader , How art thou fallen , my Spain ! how art thou sunk at this hour !</p>
   <p>II . Once thy magnanimous sons trod , victors , the portals of Asia , Once the Pacific waves rushed , joyful thy banners to see ; For it was Trajan that carried the battle-flushed eagles to Dacia , Cortes that planted thy flag fast by the uttermost sea .</p>
   <p>III . Hast thou forgotten those days illumined with glory and honour , When the far isles of the sea thrilled to the tread of Castile ? When every land under Heaven was flecked by the shade of thy banner , -  When every beam of the sun flashed on thy conquering steel ?</p>
   <p>IV . Then through red fields of slaughter , through death and defeat and disaster , Still flared thy banner aloft , tattered , but free from a stain , -  Now to the upstart Savoyard thou bendest to beg for a master ! How the red flush of her shame mars the proud beauty of Spain !</p>
   <p>V. Has the red blood run cold that boiled by the Xenil and Darro ? Are the high deeds of the sires sung to the children no more ? On the dun hills of the North hast thou heard of no plough-boy Pizarro ? Roams no young swine-herd Cortes hid by the Tagus ’ wild shore ?</p>
   <p>VI . Once again does Hispania bend low to the yoke of the stranger ! Once again will she rise , flinging her gyves in the sea ! Princeling of Piedmont ! unwitting thou weddest with doubt and with danger , King over men who have learned all that it costs to be free .</p>

    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">In the tough grim talk of the monkish days</l>

   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">A wordless carol of life and love ,</l>

     <l n="4">Looked up at each other and smiled .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">And tender and gay the bird sang on ,</l>
     <l n="6">And cooed and whistled and trilled ,</l>
     <l n="7">And the wasteful wealth of life and love</l>
     <l n="8">From his happy heart was spilled .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">The song had power on the grim old monks</l>

     <l n="10">“ I am the Devil , ” he said .</l>

     <l n="12">Away through the twilight sped .</l>

     <l n="6">The same bright eyes and the same dark hair ;</l>

   <p>She rose , and laughed with thankful joy , Sure that the god would save the boy . She found a lotus by the stream ; She plucked it from its noonday dream , And then from door to door she fared , To ask what house by Death was spared . Her heart grew cold to see the eyes Of all dilate with slow surprise : “ Kilvani , thou hast lost thy head ; Nothing can help a child that 's dead . There stands not by the Ganges ’ side A house where none hath ever died . ” Thus , through the long and weary day , From every door she bore away Within her heart , and on her arm , A heavier load , a deeper harm . By gates of gold and ivory , By wattled huts of poverty , The same refrain heard poor Kilvani , THE LIVING ARE FEW , THE DEAD ARE MANY .</p>
