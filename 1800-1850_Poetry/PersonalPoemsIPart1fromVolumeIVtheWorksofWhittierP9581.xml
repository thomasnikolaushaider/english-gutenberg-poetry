      <head>A LAMENT</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">“ The parted spirit ,</l>
       <l n="2">Knoweth it not our sorrow ? Answereth not</l>
       <l n="3">Its blessing to our tears ? ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="4">The circle is broken , one seat is forsaken ,</l>
       <l n="5">One bud from the tree of our friendship is shaken ;</l>
       <l n="6">One heart from among us no longer shall thrill</l>
       <l n="7">With joy in our gladness , or grief in our ill .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="8">Weep ! lonely and lowly are slumbering now</l>
       <l n="9">The light of her glances , the pride of her brow ;</l>
       <l n="10">Weep ! sadly and long shall we listen in vain</l>
       <l n="11">To hear the soft tones of her welcome again .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="12">Give our tears to the dead ! For humanity 's claim</l>
       <l n="13">From its silence and darkness is ever the same ;</l>
       <l n="14">The hope of that world whose existence is bliss</l>
       <l n="15">May not stifle the tears of the mourners of this .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="16">For , oh ! if one glance the freed spirit can throw</l>
       <l n="17">On the scene of its troubled probation below ,</l>
       <l n="18">Than the pride of the marble , the pomp of the dead ,</l>
       <l n="19">To that glance will be dearer the tears which we shed .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="20">Oh , who can forget the mild light of her smile ,</l>
       <l n="21">Over lips moved with music and feeling the while ,</l>
       <l n="22">The eye 's deep enchantment , dark , dream-like , and clear ,</l>
       <l n="23">In the glow of its gladness , the shade of its tear .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="24">And the charm of her features , while over the whole</l>
       <l n="25">Played the hues of the heart and the sunshine of soul ;</l>
       <l n="26">And the tones of her voice , like the music which seems</l>
       <l n="27">Murmured low in our ears by the Angel of dreams !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="28">But holier and dearer our memories hold</l>
       <l n="29">Those treasures of feeling , more precious than gold ,</l>
       <l n="30">The love and the kindness and pity which gave</l>
       <l n="31">Fresh flowers for the bridal , green wreaths for the grave !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="9">
       <l n="32">The heart ever open to Charity 's claim ,</l>
       <l n="33">Unmoved from its purpose by censure and blame ,</l>
       <l n="34">While vainly alike on her eye and her ear</l>
       <l n="35">Fell the scorn of the heartless , the jesting and jeer .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="10">
       <l n="36">How true to our hearts was that beautiful sleeper</l>
       <l n="37">With smiles for the joyful , with tears for the weeper ,</l>
       <l n="38">Yet , evermore prompt , whether mournful or gay ,</l>
       <l n="39">With warnings in love to the passing astray .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="11">
       <l n="40">For , though spotless herself , she could sorrow for them</l>
       <l n="41">Who sullied with evil the spirit 's pure gem ;</l>
       <l n="42">And a sigh or a tear could the erring reprove ,</l>
       <l n="43">And the sting of reproof was still tempered by love .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="12">
       <l n="44">As a cloud of the sunset , slow melting in heaven ,</l>
       <l n="45">As a star that is lost when the daylight is given ,</l>
       <l n="46">As a glad dream of slumber , which wakens in bliss ,</l>
       <l n="47">She hath passed to the world of the holy from this .</l>

      <head>TO THE MEMORY OF CHARLES B. STORRS ,</head>
      <head>Late President of Western Reserve College , who died at his post of duty , overworn by his strenuous labors with tongue and pen in the cause of Human Freedom .</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">Thou hast fallen in thine armor ,</l>
       <l n="2">Thou martyr of the Lord</l>
       <l n="3">With thy last breath crying “ Onward ! ”</l>
       <l n="4">And thy hand upon the sword .</l>
       <l n="5">The haughty heart derideth ,</l>
       <l n="6">And the sinful lip reviles ,</l>
       <l n="7">But the blessing of the perishing</l>
       <l n="8">Around thy pillow smiles !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="9">When to our cup of trembling</l>
       <l n="10">The added drop is given ,</l>
       <l n="11">And the long-suspended thunder</l>
       <l n="12">Falls terribly from Heaven ,—</l>
       <l n="13">When a new and fearful freedom</l>
       <l n="14">Is proffered of the Lord</l>
       <l n="15">To the slow-consuming Famine ,</l>
       <l n="16">The Pestilence and Sword !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="17">When the refuges of Falsehood</l>
       <l n="18">Shall be swept away in wrath ,</l>
       <l n="19">And the temple shall be shaken ,</l>
       <l n="20">With its idol , to the earth ,</l>
       <l n="21">Shall not thy words of warning</l>
       <l n="22">Be all remembered then ?</l>
       <l n="23">And thy now unheeded message</l>
       <l n="24">Burn in the hearts of men ?</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="25">Oppression 's hand may scatter</l>
       <l n="26">Its nettles on thy tomb ,</l>
       <l n="27">And even Christian bosoms</l>
       <l n="28">Deny thy memory room ;</l>
       <l n="29">For lying lips shall torture</l>
       <l n="30">Thy mercy into crime ,</l>
       <l n="31">And the slanderer shall flourish</l>
       <l n="32">As the bay-tree for a time .</l>

       <l n="33">But where the south-wind lingers</l>

       <l n="35">Or falls the careless sunbeam</l>
       <l n="36">Down Georgia 's golden mines ;</l>
       <l n="37">Where now beneath his burthen</l>
       <l n="38">The toiling slave is driven ;</l>
       <l n="39">Where now a tyrant 's mockery</l>
       <l n="40">Is offered unto Heaven ;</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="41">Where Mammon hath its altars</l>
       <l n="42">Wet o'er with human blood ,</l>
       <l n="43">And pride and lust debases</l>
       <l n="44">The workmanship of God ,—</l>
       <l n="45">There shall thy praise be spoken ,</l>
       <l n="46">Redeemed from Falsehood 's ban ,</l>
       <l n="47">When the fetters shall be broken ,</l>

       <l n="6">And left , as its young beauty fled ,</l>
       <l n="7">An ashen memory in its stead ,</l>
       <l n="8">The twilight of a parted day</l>
       <l n="9">Whose fading light is cold and vain ,</l>
       <l n="10">The heart 's faint echo of a strain</l>
       <l n="11">Of low , sweet music passed away .</l>
       <l n="12">That true and loving heart , that gift</l>
       <l n="13">Of a mind , earnest , clear , profound ,</l>
       <l n="14">Bestowing , with a glad unthrift ,</l>
       <l n="15">Its sunny light on all around ,</l>
       <l n="16">Affinities which only could</l>

       <l n="18">And sympathies which found no rest ,</l>

       <l n="20">Of them — of thee — remains there naught</l>
       <l n="21">But sorrow in the mourner 's breast ?</l>
       <l n="22">A shadow in the land of thought ?</l>
       <l n="23">No ! Even my weak and trembling faith</l>
       <l n="24">Can lift for thee the veil which doubt</l>
       <l n="25">And human fear have drawn about</l>
       <l n="26">The all-awaiting scene of death .</l>

       <l n="32">Beside our childhood 's Merrimac ,</l>
       <l n="33">I saw thy dark eye wander o'er</l>

       <l n="35">And heard thy low , soft voice alone</l>
       <l n="36">Midst lapse of waters , and the tone</l>
       <l n="37">Of pine-leaves by the west-wind blown ,</l>

       <l n="41">Baptized in immortality !</l>
       <l n="42">Not mine the sad and freezing dream</l>
       <l n="43">Of souls that , with their earthly mould ,</l>
       <l n="44">Cast off the loves and joys of old ,</l>
       <l n="45">Unbodied , like a pale moonbeam ,</l>
       <l n="46">As pure , as passionless , and cold ;</l>
       <l n="47">Nor mine the hope of Indra 's son ,</l>
       <l n="48">Of slumbering in oblivion 's rest ,</l>
       <l n="49">Life 's myriads blending into one ,</l>
       <l n="50">In blank annihilation blest ;</l>
       <l n="51">Dust-atoms of the infinite ,</l>
       <l n="52">Sparks scattered from the central light ,</l>

       <l n="58">And still I think of them the same</l>
       <l n="59">As when the Master 's summons came ;</l>
       <l n="60">Their change ,— the holy morn-light breaking</l>
       <l n="61">Upon the dream-worn sleeper , waking ,—</l>

      <head>FOLLEN .</head>
      <head>ON READING HIS ESSAY ON THE “ FUTURE STATE . ”</head>
      <head>Charles Follen , one of the noblest contributions of Germany to American citizenship , was at an early age driven from his professorship in the University of Jena , and compelled to seek shelter from official prosecution in Switzerland , on account of his liberal political opinions . He became Professor of Civil Law in the University of Basle . The governments of Prussia , Austria , and Russia united in demanding his delivery as a political offender ; and , in consequence , he left Switzerland , and came to the United States . At the time of the formation of the American Anti-Slavery Society he was a Professor in Harvard University , honored for his genius , learning , and estimable character . His love of liberty and hatred of oppression led him to seek an interview with Garrison and express his sympathy with him . Soon after , he attended a meeting of the New England Anti-Slavery Society . An able speech was made by Rev . A . A. Phelps , and a letter of mine addressed to the Secretary of the Society was read . Whereupon he rose and stated that his views were in unison with those of the Society , and that after hearing the speech and the letter , he was ready to join it , and abide the probable consequences of such an unpopular act . He lost by so doing his professorship . He was an able member of the Executive Committee of the American Anti-Slavery Society . He perished in the ill-fated steamer Lexington , which was burned on its passage from New York , January 13 , 1840 . The few writings left behind him show him to have been a profound thinker of rare spiritual insight .</head>

      <head>CHALKLEY HALL .</head>
      <head>Chalkley Hall , near Frankford , Pa ., was the residence of Thomas Chalkley , an eminent minister of the Friends ’ denomination . He was one of the early settlers of the Colony , and his Journal , which was published in 1749 , presents a quaint but beautiful picture of a life of unostentatious and simple goodness . He was the master of a merchant vessel , and , in his visits to the west Indies and Great Britain , omitted no opportunity to labor for the highest interests of his fellow-men . During a temporary residence in Philadelphia , in the summer of 1838 , the quiet and beautiful scenery around the ancient village of Frankford frequently attracted me from the heat and bustle of the city . I have referred to my youthful acquaintance with his writings in Snow-Bound .</head>

      <head>TO RONGE .</head>
      <head>This was written after reading the powerful and manly protest of Johannes Ronge against the “ pious fraud ” of the Bishop of Treves . The bold movement of the young Catholic priest of Prussian Silesia seemed to me full of promise to the cause of political as well as religious liberty in Europe . That it failed was due partly to the faults of the reformer , but mainly to the disagreement of the Liberals of Germany upon a matter of dogma , which prevented them from unity of action . Rouge was born in Silesia in 1813 and died in October , 1887 . His autobiography was translated into English and published in London in 1846 .</head>
       <l n="1">Strike home , strong-hearted man ! Down to the root</l>

       <l n="4">Put nerve into thy task . Let other men</l>

      <head>CHANNING .</head>
      <head>The last time I saw Dr. Channing was in the summer of 1841 , when , in company with my English friend , Joseph Sturge , so well known for his philanthropic labors and liberal political opinions , I visited him in his summer residence in Rhode Island . In recalling the impressions of that visit , it can scarcely be necessary to say , that I have no reference to the peculiar religious opinions of a man whose life , beautifully and truly manifested above the atmosphere of sect , is now the world 's common legacy .</head>

      <head>ELLIOTT .</head>
      <head>Ebenezer Elliott was to the artisans of England what Burns was to the peasantry of Scotland . His Corn-law Rhymes contributed not a little to that overwhelming tide of popular opinion and feeling which resulted in the repeal of the tax on bread . Well has the eloquent author of The Reforms and Reformers of Great Britain said of him , “ Not corn-law repealers alone , but all Britons who moisten their scanty bread with the sweat of the brow , are largely indebted to his inspiring lay , for the mighty bound which the laboring mind of England has taken in our day . ”</head>

      <head>ICHABOD</head>
      <head>This poem was the outcome of the surprise and grief and forecast of evil consequences which I felt on reading the seventh of March speech of Daniel Webster in support of the “ compromise , ” and the Fugitive Slave Law . No partisan or personal enmity dictated it . On the contrary my admiration of the splendid personality and intellectual power of the great Senator was never stronger than when I laid down his speech , and , in one of the saddest moments of my life , penned my protest . I saw , as I wrote , with painful clearness its sure results ,— the Slave Power arrogant and defiant , strengthened and encouraged to carry out its scheme for the extension of its baleful system , or the dissolution of the Union , the guaranties of personal liberty in the free States broken down , and the whole country made the hunting-ground of slave-catchers . In the horror of such a vision , so soon fearfully fulfilled , if one spoke at all , he could only speak in tones of stern and sorrowful rebuke . But death softens all resentments , and the consciousness of a common inheritance of frailty and weakness modifies the severity of judgment . Years after , in The Lost Occasion I gave utterance to an almost universal regret that the great statesman did not live to see the flag which he loved trampled under the feet of Slavery , and , in view of this desecration , make his last days glorious in defence of “ Liberty and Union , one and inseparable . ”</head>

       <l n="61">In the dark hours we thought of thee ,</l>

       <l n="73">Fit emblem of enduring fame ,</l>
       <l n="74">One lofty summit keeps thy name .</l>
       <l n="75">For thee the cosmic forces did</l>
       <l n="76">The rearing of that pyramid ,</l>

       <l n="82">Their jewels in its coronet .</l>
       <l n="83">And evermore that mountain mass</l>
       <l n="84">Seems climbing from the shadowy pass</l>

      <head>It can scarcely be necessary to say that there are elements in the character and passages in the history of the great Hungarian statesman and orator , which necessarily command the admiration of those , even , who believe that no political revolution was ever worth the price of human blood .</head>

       <l n="6">Welcome to him , who , while he strove to break</l>

       <l n="9">Rearing the altar of his Fatherland</l>
