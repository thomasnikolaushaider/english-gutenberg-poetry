     <l n="19">They ran through the streets of the seaport town ;</l>
     <l n="20">They peered from the decks of the ships that lay :</l>
     <l n="21">The cold sea-fog that came whitening down</l>
     <l n="22">Was never as cold or white as they .</l>
     <l n="23">“ Ho , Starbuck and Pinckney and Tenterden !</l>
     <l n="24">Run for your shallops , gather your men ,</l>
     <l n="25">Scatter your boats on the lower bay . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="26">Good cause for fear ! In the thick midday</l>
     <l n="27">The hulk that lay by the rotting pier ,</l>
     <l n="28">Filled with the children in happy play ,</l>
     <l n="29">Parted its moorings , and drifted clear ,—</l>
     <l n="30">Drifted clear beyond the reach or call ,—</l>
     <l n="31">Thirteen children they were in all ,—</l>
     <l n="32">All adrift in the lower bay !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="33">Said a hard-faced skipper , “ God help us all !</l>
     <l n="34">She will not float till the turning tide ! ”</l>
     <l n="35">Said his wife , “ My darling will hear my call ,</l>
     <l n="36">Whether in sea or heaven she bide : ”</l>
     <l n="37">And she lifted a quavering voice and high ,</l>
     <l n="38">Wild and strange as a sea-bird 's cry ,</l>
     <l n="39">Till they shuddered and wondered at her side .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="40">The fog drove down on each laboring crew ,</l>
     <l n="41">Veiled each from each and the sky and shore :</l>
     <l n="42">There was not a sound but the breath they drew ,</l>
     <l n="43">And the lap of water and creak of oar ;</l>
     <l n="44">And they felt the breath of the downs , fresh blown</l>
     <l n="45">O'er leagues of clover and cold gray stone ,</l>
     <l n="46">But not from the lips that had gone before .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="47">They come no more . But they tell the tale ,</l>
     <l n="48">That , when fogs are thick on the harbor reef ,</l>
     <l n="49">The mackerel fishers shorten sail ;</l>
     <l n="50">For the signal they know will bring relief :</l>
     <l n="51">For the voices of children , still at play</l>
     <l n="52">In a phantom hulk that drifts alway</l>
     <l n="53">Through channels whose waters never fail .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="54">It is but a foolish shipman 's tale ,</l>
     <l n="55">A theme for a poet 's idle page ;</l>
     <l n="56">But still , when the mists of doubt prevail ,</l>
     <l n="57">And we lie becalmed by the shores of Age ,</l>
     <l n="58">We hear from the misty troubled shore</l>
     <l n="59">The voice of the children gone before ,</l>
     <l n="60">Drawing the soul to its anchorage .</l>

     <l n="61">A Newport Romance .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="62">They say that she died of a broken heart</l>
     <l n="63">( I tell the tale as ‘ twas told to me ) ;</l>
     <l n="64">But her spirit lives , and her soul is part</l>
     <l n="65">Of this sad old house by the sea .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="66">Her lover was fickle and fine and French :</l>
     <l n="67">It was nearly a hundred years ago</l>
     <l n="68">When he sailed away from her arms — poor wench —</l>
     <l n="69">With the Admiral Rochambeau .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="70">I marvel much what periwigged phrase</l>
     <l n="71">Won the heart of this sentimental Quaker ,</l>
     <l n="72">At what golden-laced speech of those modish days</l>
     <l n="73">She listened — the mischief take her !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="74">But she kept the posies of mignonette</l>
     <l n="75">That he gave ; and ever as their bloom failed</l>
     <l n="76">And faded ( though with her tears still wet )</l>
     <l n="77">Her youth with their own exhaled .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="78">Till one night , when the sea-fog wrapped a shroud</l>
     <l n="79">Round spar and spire and tarn and tree ,</l>
     <l n="80">Her soul went up on that lifted cloud</l>
     <l n="81">From this sad old house by the sea .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="82">And ever since then , when the clock strikes two ,</l>
     <l n="83">She walks unbidden from room to room ,</l>
     <l n="84">And the air is filled that she passes through</l>
     <l n="85">With a subtle , sad perfume .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="19">
     <l n="86">The delicate odor of mignonette ,</l>
     <l n="87">The ghost of a dead and gone bouquet ,</l>
     <l n="88">Is all that tells of her story ; yet</l>
     <l n="89">Could she think of a sweeter way ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="20">
     <l n="90">I sit in the sad old house to-night ,—</l>
     <l n="91">Myself a ghost from a farther sea ;</l>
     <l n="92">And I trust that this Quaker woman might ,</l>
     <l n="93">In courtesy , visit me .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="21">
     <l n="94">For the laugh is fled from porch and lawn ,</l>
     <l n="95">And the bugle died from the fort on the hill ,</l>
     <l n="96">And the twitter of girls on the stairs is gone ,</l>
     <l n="97">And the grand piano is still .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="22">
     <l n="98">Somewhere in the darkness a clock strikes two ;</l>
     <l n="99">And there is no sound in the sad old house ,</l>
     <l n="100">But the long veranda dripping with dew ,</l>
     <l n="101">And in the wainscot a mouse .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="23">
     <l n="102">The light of my study-lamp streams out</l>
     <l n="103">From the library door , but has gone astray</l>
     <l n="104">In the depths of the darkened hall . Small doubt</l>
     <l n="105">But the Quakeress knows the way .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="24">
     <l n="106">Was it the trick of a sense o'erwrought</l>
     <l n="107">With outward watching and inward fret ?</l>
     <l n="108">But I swear that the air just now was fraught</l>
     <l n="109">With the odor of mignonette !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="25">
     <l n="110">I open the window , and seem almost —</l>
     <l n="111">So still lies the ocean — to hear the beat</l>
     <l n="112">Of its Great Gulf artery off the coast ,</l>
     <l n="113">And to bask in its tropic heat .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="26">
     <l n="114">In my neighbor 's windows the gas-lights flare ,</l>
     <l n="115">As the dancers swing in a waltz of Strauss ;</l>
     <l n="116">And I wonder now could I fit that air</l>
     <l n="117">To the song of this sad old house .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="27">
     <l n="118">And no odor of mignonette there is</l>
     <l n="119">But the breath of morn on the dewy lawn ;</l>
     <l n="120">And mayhap from causes as slight as this</l>
     <l n="121">The quaint old legend is born .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="28">
     <l n="122">But the soul of that subtle , sad perfume ,</l>
     <l n="123">As the spiced embalmings , they say , outlast</l>
     <l n="124">The mummy laid in his rocky tomb ,</l>
     <l n="125">Awakens my buried past .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="29">
     <l n="126">And I think of the passion that shook my youth ,</l>
     <l n="127">Of its aimless loves and its idle pains ,</l>
     <l n="128">And am thankful now for the certain truth</l>
     <l n="129">That only the sweet remains .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="30">
     <l n="130">And I hear no rustle of stiff brocade ,</l>
     <l n="131">And I see no face at my library door ;</l>
     <l n="132">For now that the ghosts of my heart are laid ,</l>
     <l n="133">She is viewless forevermore .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="31">
     <l n="134">But whether she came as a faint perfume ,</l>
     <l n="135">Or whether a spirit in stole of white ,</l>
     <l n="136">I feel , as I pass from the darkened room ,</l>
     <l n="137">She has been with my soul to-night !</l>

     <l n="140">We checked our pace ,— the red road sharply rounding ;</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="35">
