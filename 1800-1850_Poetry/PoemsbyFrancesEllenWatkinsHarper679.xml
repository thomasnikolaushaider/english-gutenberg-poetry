     <l n="13">Again , I hear her gentle voice</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">The music of her voice is stilled ,</l>
     <l n="2">Her lips are paled in death .</l>
     <l n="3">As precious pearls I 'll clasp her words</l>
     <l n="4">Until my latest breath .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">The world has scattered round my path</l>
     <l n="6">Honor and wealth and fame ;</l>
     <l n="7">But naught so precious as the thoughts</l>
     <l n="8">That gather round her name .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">And friends have placed upon my brow</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">My hair is silvered o'er with age ,</l>

     <l n="16">And be a child at heart .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="17">To roam with her the glory-land</l>

     <l n="19">To cast our crowns with songs of love</l>
     <l n="20">At our Redeemer 's feet .</l>

    <head>A GRAIN OF SAND .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Do you see this grain of sand</l>
     <l n="2">Lying loosely in my hand ?</l>
     <l n="3">Do you know to me it brought</l>
     <l n="4">Just a simple loving thought ?</l>
     <l n="5">When one gazes night by night</l>
     <l n="6">On the glorious stars of light ,</l>
     <l n="7">Oh how little seems the span</l>
     <l n="8">Measured round the life of man .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">Oh ! how fleeting are his years</l>
     <l n="10">With their smiles and their tears ;</l>
     <l n="11">Can it be that God does care</l>
     <l n="12">For such atoms as we are ?</l>
     <l n="13">Then outspake this grain of sand</l>
     <l n="14">“ I was fashioned by His hand</l>
     <l n="15">In the star lit realms of space</l>
     <l n="16">I was made to have a place .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="17">“ Should the ocean flood the world ,</l>
     <l n="18">Were its mountains ‘ gainst me hurled</l>
     <l n="19">All the force they could employ</l>
     <l n="20">Would n't a single grain destroy ;</l>
     <l n="21">And if I , a thing so light ,</l>
     <l n="22">Have a place within His sight ;</l>
     <l n="23">You are linked unto his throne</l>
     <l n="24">Cannot live nor die alone .</l>

     <l n="1">In the everlasting arms</l>
     <l n="2">Mid life 's dangers and alarms</l>
     <l n="3">Let calm trust your spirit fill ;</l>
     <l n="4">Know He 's God , and then be still . ”</l>
     <l n="5">Trustingly I raised my head</l>

     <l n="5">While the snow-drops still were sleeping</l>

     <l n="9">Not a daffodil nor daisy</l>

    <head>THE CROCUSES . 5</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Though a tremor of the winter</l>
     <l n="2">Did shivering through them run ;</l>
     <l n="3">Yet they lifted up their foreheads</l>
     <l n="4">To greet the vernal sun .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">And the sunbeams gave them welcome .</l>
     <l n="6">As did the morning air</l>
     <l n="7">And scattered o'er their simple robes</l>
     <l n="8">Rich tints of beauty rare .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">Soon a host of lovely flowers</l>
     <l n="10">From vales and woodland burst ;</l>
     <l n="11">But in all that fair procession</l>
     <l n="12">The crocuses were first .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">First to weave for Earth a chaplet</l>
     <l n="14">To crown her dear old head ;</l>
     <l n="15">And to beautify the pathway</l>
     <l n="16">Where winter still did tread .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="17">And their loved and white haired mother</l>
     <l n="18">Smiled sweetly ‘ neath the touch ,</l>
     <l n="19">When she knew her faithful children</l>
     <l n="20">Were loving her so much .</l>
