   <p>Did you ever see a person who was dead ? Perhaps you have seen one of your own brothers or sisters lying on a death-bed . What a change takes place when we die ! No more breath comes out of the mouth , no colour is seen on the cheeks ; the eye can look at us no longer , nor the tongue speak to us ; the body soon grows cold and stiff ; it has no more feeling than the ground on which we tread . And why ? Because the soul is gone out of the body . While the soul or spirit is in us we are alive , but when it is gone out then we are dead . The soul can never die , but the body is only made of dust , and it soon crumbles away and becomes dust again .</p>
   <p>No one can make a dead person alive again . Yet once there was a man in this world who made dead people alive . Who was that man ? He was called Jesus ; he was not only a man , he was God too ; he was the Son of God . Most people would not believe that he was the Son of God , though he said he was . Yet we are sure he said true , for if he had been a wicked man he could not have made dead people alive again . God his Father was with him , and this was the reason he did such wonderful things .</p>
   <p>One day a rich man came to Jesus , and fell down at his feet , and begged him to come to his house . He said , “ My little daughter is dying . ” He was very unhappy , he loved his little girl very much , and she was his only child . His name was Jairus , but I do not know the name of his little girl . I do know her age , she was twelve years old . The father thought that if Jesus only put his hands upon her he could make her well .</p>
   <p>The Son of God was very kind to people in trouble . He went with the father , and a great crowd followed him . As he went along the road , he was pressed on every side by those who wanted to see him and to hear what he said .</p>
   <p>Before he reached the sick man 's house , some people came and said to the father , “ Your daughter is dead . ” They told him it was now of no use for Jesus to come . They little knew what he could do ; but Jesus said to the father , “ Do not be afraid , she shall be made well . ”</p>
   <p>When he came to the house , he only allowed three of his friends to come in with him . Their names were Peter , James , and John . There was a great noise and bustle in the house ; there were men playing music , and people weeping and crying out with loud voices because the girl was dead . When Jesus came into the room where she was lying , he said to these people , “ Why do you make this noise ? The girl is not dead , she only sleeps . ” Then they began to laugh at him , for they knew the child was dead . Why did Jesus say she slept ? Because she was soon to be made alive . Her death was like sleep .</p>
   <p>Jesus would not let the people who mocked , stay in the room , but he let the girl 's father and mother be there , and his own three friends . There were just these five in the room with him when he went to the bed and took hold of the girl 's hand and said , “ Girl , I say unto thee , arise . ” Immediately her spirit ( or her soul ) came again into her body . Then she was alive . She was now quite well ; she was not weak now , as she had been ; she got up out of her bed and walked about . Then Jesus desired that something might be given her to eat . Her parents were very much surprised . They had been afraid that Jesus would not be able to make her alive . They did not know he could do everything . He made all our bodies and gave us souls , and one day he will call all the dead people out of their graves .</p>
   <p>I wonder whether that young girl loved Jesus . She was old enough to understand what he said . At twelve years old children can understand almost as well as men and women can ; they learn more quickly , and remember better . Though they love play still , they have a great deal of sense . Some children at twelve years old begin to take great pains with their learning ; then they get on very fast . Some begin to be very useful ; they can do more now than take care of the baby or run upon errands , and often they get places as servants . If they are steady , and tell no lies , they are trusted and get on well in the world .</p>
   <p>Some children at twelve years old begin to think about their souls and to say , “ What would become of me if I were to die ? ” They go and hear sermons , and they can understand them . They look in the Bible , and they can understand a great deal which they read . Then some begin to pray and to say , “ Merciful God , give me thy Holy Spirit , for the sake of Jesus Christ . ”</p>
   <p>But there are some who at twelve years old will mind their parents no longer . They say , “ We are not little babies now , we will do as we please . ” They forget all the kindness their parents have shown them for twelve years , and they forget the words that God has spoken , “ Honour thy father and thy mother . ”</p>

   <note>Macintosh , Printer , Great New-street , London . PRAYER . O Father in Heaven , Thou hast made all things ; The sun , moon , and stars , the land and sea . Thou hast made me . Thou hast taken care of me . I thank Thee for all thy kindness . Great God , Thou art in every place ; Thou seest in the dark , As well as in the light ; Thou knowest all the naughty things That I have done , and said , and thought . O Merciful Lord , pardon my sins , Because Jesus Christ , thy dear Son , Died upon the cross for sinners . Give me thy Holy Spirit , That I may love Thee , and obey thy laws . Keep me from minding Satan , And save me from going to hell : And whenever I die , O take my soul to Heaven . When Jesus comes with clouds , And with the holy angels , May I be glad to see Him . May my dear parents , and brothers , and sisters , Be happy with Thee for ever and ever . May all people love Thee , And speak of thy goodness . Hear me for Christ 's sake . Amen .</note>
