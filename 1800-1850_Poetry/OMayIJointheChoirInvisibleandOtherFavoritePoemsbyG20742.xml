     <l n="2">O may I join the choir invisible</l>
     <l n="3">Of those immortal dead who live again</l>
     <l n="4">In minds made better by their presence ; live</l>
     <l n="5">In pulses stirred to generosity ,</l>
     <l n="6">In deeds of daring rectitude , in scorn</l>
     <l n="7">Of miserable aims that end with self ,</l>
     <l n="8">In thoughts sublime that pierce the night like stars ,</l>
     <l n="9">And with their mild persistence urge men 's minds</l>
     <l n="10">To vaster issues .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="11">So to live is heaven :</l>
     <l n="12">To make undying music in the world ,</l>
     <l n="13">Breathing a beauteous order that controls</l>
     <l n="14">With growing sway the growing life of man .</l>
     <l n="15">So we inherit that sweet purity</l>
     <l n="16">For which we struggled , failed and agonized</l>
     <l n="17">With widening retrospect that bred despair .</l>
     <l n="18">Rebellious flesh that would not be subdued ,</l>
     <l n="19">A vicious parent shaming still its child ,</l>
     <l n="20">Poor , anxious penitence is quick dissolved ;</l>
     <l n="21">Its discords , quenched by meeting harmonies ,</l>
     <l n="22">Die in the large and charitable air ;</l>
     <l n="23">And all our rarer , better , truer self ,</l>
     <l n="24">That sobbed religiously in yearning song ,</l>
     <l n="25">That watched to ease the burden of the world ,</l>
     <l n="26">Laboriously tracing what must be ,</l>
     <l n="27">And what may yet be better — saw rather</l>
     <l n="28">A worthier image for the sanctuary</l>
     <l n="29">And shaped it forth before the multitude ,</l>
     <l n="30">Divinely human , raising worship so</l>
     <l n="31">To higher reverence more mixed with love —</l>
     <l n="32">That better self shall live till human Time</l>
     <l n="33">Shall fold its eyelids , and the human sky</l>
     <l n="34">Be gathered like a scroll within the tomb</l>
     <l n="35">Unread forever .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="36">This is life to come ,</l>
     <l n="37">Which martyred men have made more glorious</l>
     <l n="38">For us who strive to follow .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="39">May I reach</l>
     <l n="40">That purest heaven — be to other souls</l>
     <l n="41">The cup of strength in some great agony ,</l>
     <l n="42">Enkindle generous ardor , feed pure love ,</l>
     <l n="43">Beget the smiles that have no cruelty ,</l>
     <l n="44">Be the sweet presence of a good diffused ,</l>
     <l n="45">And in diffusion ever more intense !</l>
     <l n="46">So shall I join the choir invisible</l>
     <l n="47">Whose music is the gladness of the world .</l>

    <head>HOW THEY BROUGHT THE GOOD NEWS FROM GHENT TO AIX .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">{ At Aerschot up leaped of a sudden the Sun : p1. jpg }</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="2">I sprang to the stirrup , and Joris and he :</l>
     <l n="3">I galloped , Dirck galloped , we galloped all three ;</l>
     <l n="4">“ Good speed ! ” cried the watch as the gate-bolts undrew ,</l>
     <l n="5">“ Speed ! ” echoed the wall to us galloping through .</l>
     <l n="6">Behind shut the postern , the lights sank to rest ,</l>
     <l n="7">And into the midnight we galloped abreast .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="8">Not a word to each other ; we kept the great pace —</l>
     <l n="9">Neck by neck , stride by stride , never changing our place ;</l>
     <l n="10">I turned in my saddle and made its girths tight ,</l>
     <l n="11">Then shortened each stirrup and set the pique right ,</l>
     <l n="12">Rebuckled the check-strap , chained slacker the bit ,</l>
     <l n="13">Nor galloped less steadily Roland a whit .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="14">‘ Twas moonset at starting ; but while we drew near</l>
     <l n="15">Lokeren , the cocks crew and twilight dawned clear ;</l>
     <l n="16">At Boom a great yellow star came out to see ;</l>
     <l n="17">At Duffeld ‘ twas morning as plain as could be ;</l>
     <l n="18">And from Mecheln church-steeple we heard the half-chime —</l>
     <l n="19">So Joris broke silence with “ Yet there is time ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="20">At Aerschot up leaped of a sudden the sun ,</l>
     <l n="21">And against him the cattle stood black every one ,</l>
     <l n="22">To stare through the mist at us galloping past ;</l>
     <l n="23">And I saw my stout galloper Roland at last</l>
     <l n="24">With resolute shoulders , each butting away</l>
     <l n="25">The haze , as some bluff river headland its spray ;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="26">And his low head and crest , just one sharp ear bent back</l>
     <l n="27">For my voice , and the other pricked out on his track ,</l>
     <l n="28">And one eye 's black intelligence — ever that glance</l>
     <l n="29">O'er its white edge at me , his own master , askance ;</l>
     <l n="30">And the thick heavy spume-flakes , which aye and anon</l>
     <l n="31">His fierce lips shook upwards in galloping on .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="32">By Hasselt , Dirck groaned ; and cried Joris , “ Stay spur !</l>
     <l n="33">Your Roos galloped bravely , the fault 's not in her ;</l>
     <l n="34">“ We 'll remember at Aix ” — for one heard the quick wheeze</l>
     <l n="35">Of her chest , saw the stretched neck and staggering knees ,</l>
     <l n="36">And sunk tail , and horrible heave of the flank ,</l>
     <l n="37">As down on her haunches she shuddered and sank .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="38">So we were left galloping , Joris and I ,</l>
     <l n="39">Past Looz and past Tongres , no cloud in the sky ;</l>
     <l n="40">The broad sun above laughed a pitiless laugh ;</l>
     <l n="41">‘ Neath our feet broke the brittle bright stubble like chaff ;</l>
     <l n="42">Till over by Delhem a dome spire sprung white ,</l>
     <l n="43">And “ Gallop , ” gasped Joris , “ for Aix is in sight !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="44">“ How they 'll greet us ! ” — and all in a moment his roan</l>
     <l n="45">Rolled neck and croup over , lay dead as a stone ;</l>
     <l n="46">And there was my Roland to bear the whole weight</l>
     <l n="47">Of the news which alone could save Aix from her fate ,</l>
     <l n="48">With his nostrils like pits full of blood to the brim ,</l>
     <l n="49">And with circles of red for his eye-sockets ’ rim .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="50">Then I cast loose my buff-coat , each holster let fall ,</l>
     <l n="51">Shook off both my jack-boots , let go belt and all ,</l>
     <l n="52">Stood up in the stirrup , leaned , patted his ear ,</l>
     <l n="53">Called my Roland his pet name , my horse without peer —</l>
     <l n="54">Clapped my hands , laughed and sung , any noise , bad or good ,</l>
     <l n="55">Till at length into Aix Roland galloped and stood .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="56">And all I remember is friends flocking around ,</l>
     <l n="57">As I sate with his head twixt my knees on the ground ;</l>
     <l n="58">And no voice but was praising this Roland of mine</l>
     <l n="59">As I poured down his throat our last measure of wine ,</l>
     <l n="60">Which ( the burgesses voted by common consent )</l>
     <l n="61">Was no more than his due who brought good news from Ghent .</l>

     <l n="6">Yet I was a poetess only last year ,</l>

     <l n="21">To teach them . . . It stings there . I made them indeed</l>

     <l n="23">That a country 's a thing men should die for at need .</l>
     <l n="24">I prated of liberty , rights , and about</l>

     <l n="26">And when their eyes flashed , oh , my beautiful eyes !</l>

     <l n="28">Of the guns , and denied not . But then the surprise ,</l>
     <l n="29">When one sits quite alone ! Then one weeps , then one kneels !</l>

     <l n="31">At first happy news came , in gay letters moiled</l>

     <l n="1">Hail to thee , blithe spirit —</l>
     <l n="2">Bird thou never wert —</l>
     <l n="3">That from heaven or near it</l>
     <l n="4">Pourest thy full heart</l>
