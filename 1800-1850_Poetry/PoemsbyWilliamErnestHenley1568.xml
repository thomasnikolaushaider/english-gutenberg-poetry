    <body>
     <p>My friend and publisher , Mr. Alfred Nutt , asks me to introduce this re-issue of old work in a new shape . At his request , then , I have to say that nearly all the numbers contained in the present volume are reprinted from ‘ A Book of Verses ’ ( 1888 ) and ‘ London Voluntaries ’ ( 1892-3 ) . From the first of these I have removed some copies of verse which seemed to me scarce worth keeping ; and I have recovered for it certain others from those publications which had made room for them . I have corrected where I could , added such dates as I might , and , by re-arrangement and revision , done my best to give my book , such as it is , its final form . If any be displeased by the result , I can but submit that my verses are my own , and that this is how I would have them read .</p>
     <p>The work of revision has reminded me that , small as is this book of mine , it is all in the matter of verse that I have to show for the years between 1872 and 1897 . A principal reason is that , after spending the better part of my life in the pursuit of poetry , I found myself ( about 1877 ) so utterly unmarketable that I had to own myself beaten in art , and to addict myself to journalism for the next ten years . Came the production by my old friend , Mr. H. B. Donkin , in his little collection of ‘ Voluntaries ’ ( 1888 ) , compiled for that East-End Hospital to which he has devoted so much time and energy and skill , of those unrhyming rhythms in which I had tried to quintessentialize , as ( I believe ) one scarce can do in rhyme , my impressions of the Old Edinburgh Infirmary . They had long since been rejected by every editor of standing in London — I had well-nigh said in the world ; but as soon as Mr. Nutt had read them , he entreated me to look for more . I did as I was told ; old dusty sheaves were dragged to light ; the work of selection and correction was begun ; I burned much ; I found that , after all , the lyrical instinct had slept — not died ; I ventured ( in brief ) ‘ A Book of Verses . ’ It was received with so much interest that I took heart once more , and wrote the numbers presently reprinted from ‘ The National Observer ’ in the collection first ( 1892 ) called ‘ The Song of the Sword ’ and afterwards ( 1893 ) , ‘ London voluntaries . ’ If I have said nothing since , it is that I have nothing to say which is not , as yet , too personal — too personal and too a afflicting — for utterance .</p>
     <p>For the matter of my book , it is there to speak for itself : -</p>

      <head>I — ENTER PATIENT</head>
       <l n="1">The morning mists still haunt the stony street ;</l>
       <l n="2">The northern summer air is shrill and cold ;</l>
       <l n="3">And lo , the Hospital , grey , quiet , old ,</l>
       <l n="4">Where Life and Death like friendly chafferers meet .</l>
       <l n="5">Thro ’ the loud spaciousness and draughty gloom</l>
       <l n="6">A small , strange child — so aged yet so young ! -</l>
       <l n="7">Her little arm besplinted and beslung ,</l>
       <l n="8">Precedes me gravely to the waiting-room .</l>
       <l n="9">I limp behind , my confidence all gone .</l>
       <l n="10">The grey-haired soldier-porter waves me on ,</l>
       <l n="11">And on I crawl , and still my spirits fail :</l>
       <l n="12">A tragic meanness seems so to environ</l>
       <l n="13">These corridors and stairs of stone and iron ,</l>
       <l n="14">Cold , naked , clean — half-workhouse and half-jail .</l>

       <l n="3">The thick , sweet mystery of chloroform ,</l>

       <l n="5">The gods are good to me : I have no wife ,</l>
       <l n="6">No innocent child , to think of as I near</l>
       <l n="7">The fateful minute ; nothing all-too dear</l>
       <l n="8">Unmans me for my bout of passive strife .</l>
       <l n="9">Yet am I tremulous and a trifle sick ,</l>
       <l n="10">And , face to face with chance , I shrink a little :</l>
       <l n="11">My hopes are strong , my will is something weak .</l>
       <l n="12">Here comes the basket ? Thank you . I am ready .</l>

       <l n="1">You are carried in a basket ,</l>

       <l n="5">Then they bid you close your eyelids ,</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="9">And you gasp and reel and shudder</l>

       <l n="3">So flashes and so fades my thought , at strife</l>
       <l n="4">With the strong stupor that I heave and choke</l>
       <l n="5">And sicken at , it is so foully sweet .</l>
       <l n="6">Faces look strange from space — and disappear .</l>
       <l n="7">Far voices , sudden loud , offend my ear -</l>
       <l n="8">And hush as sudden . Then my senses fleet :</l>
       <l n="9">All were a blank , save for this dull , new pain</l>
       <l n="10">That grinds my leg and foot ; and brokenly</l>
       <l n="11">Time and the place glimpse on to me again ;</l>
       <l n="12">And , unsurprised , out of uncertainty ,</l>
       <l n="13">I wake — relapsing — somewhat faint and fain ,</l>

       <l n="350">Swiftly . . . and grew . Tearing their beards ,</l>
       <l n="351">The sailors wept and prayed ; but the grave ship ,</l>
       <l n="352">Deep laden with spiceries and pearls , went mad ,</l>
       <l n="353">Wrenched the long tiller out of the steersman 's hand ,</l>
       <l n="354">And , turning broadside on ,</l>
       <l n="355">As the most iron would , was haled and sucked</l>
       <l n="356">Nearer , and nearer yet ;</l>
       <l n="357">And , all awash , with horrible lurching leaps</l>
       <l n="358">Rushed at that Portent , casting a shadow now</l>
       <l n="359">That swallowed sea and sky ; and then ,</l>
       <l n="360">Anchors and nails and bolts</l>
       <l n="361">Flew screaming out of her , and with clang on clang ,</l>
       <l n="362">A noise of fifty stithies , caught at the sides</l>
       <l n="363">Of the Magnetic Mountain ; and she lay ,</l>
       <l n="364">A broken bundle of firewood , strown piecemeal</l>
       <l n="365">About the waters ; and her crew</l>
       <l n="366">Passed shrieking , one by one ; and I was left</l>
       <l n="367">To drown . All the long night I swam ;</l>
       <l n="368">But in the morning , O , the smiling coast</l>
       <l n="369">Tufted with date-trees , meadowlike ,</l>
       <l n="370">Skirted with shelving sands ! And a great wave</l>
       <l n="371">Cast me ashore ; and I was saved alive .</l>
       <l n="372">So , giving thanks to God , I dried my clothes ,</l>
       <l n="373">And , faring inland , in a desert place</l>
       <l n="374">I stumbled on an iron ring -</l>
       <l n="375">The fellow of fifty built into the Quays :</l>
       <l n="376">When , scenting a trap-door ,</l>
       <l n="377">I dug , and dug ; until my biggest blade</l>
       <l n="378">Stuck into wood . And then ,</l>
       <l n="379">The flight of smooth-hewn , easy-falling stairs ,</l>
       <l n="380">Sunk in the naked rock ! The cool , clean vault ,</l>
       <l n="381">So neat with niche on niche it might have been</l>
       <l n="382">Our beer-cellar but for the rows</l>
       <l n="383">Of brazen urns ( like monstrous chemist 's jars )</l>
       <l n="384">Full to the wide , squat throats</l>
       <l n="385">With gold-dust , but a-top</l>
       <l n="386">A layer of pickled-walnut-looking things</l>
       <l n="387">I knew for olives ! And far , O , far away ,</l>
       <l n="388">The Princess of China languished ! Far away</l>
       <l n="389">Was marriage , with a Vizier and a Chief</l>
       <l n="390">Of Eunuchs and the privilege</l>
       <l n="391">Of going out at night</l>
       <l n="392">To play — unkenned , majestical , secure -</l>
       <l n="393">Where the old , brown , friendly river shaped</l>
       <l n="394">Like Tigris shore for shore ! Haply a Ghoul</l>
       <l n="395">Sat in the churchyard under a frightened moon ,</l>
       <l n="396">A thighbone in his fist , and glared</l>
       <l n="397">At supper with a Lady : she who took</l>
       <l n="398">Her rice with tweezers grain by grain .</l>
       <l n="399">Or you might stumble — there by the iron gates</l>
       <l n="400">Of the Pump Room — underneath the limes -</l>
       <l n="401">Upon Bedreddin in his shirt and drawers ,</l>
       <l n="402">Just as the civil Genie laid him down .</l>
       <l n="403">Or those red-curtained panes ,</l>
       <l n="404">Whence a tame cornet tenored it throatily</l>
       <l n="405">Of beer-pots and spittoons and new long pipes ,</l>
       <l n="406">Might turn a caravansery 's , wherein</l>
       <l n="407">You found Noureddin Ali , loftily drunk ,</l>
       <l n="408">And that fair Persian , bathed in tears ,</l>
