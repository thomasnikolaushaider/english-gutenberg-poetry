    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="2">UNDERNEATH protected branches , from the highway just aloof ;</l>
     <l n="3">Stands the house of Grand'ther Baldwin , with its gently sloping roof .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="4">Square of shape and solid-timbered , it was standing , I have heard ,</l>
     <l n="5">In the days of Whig and Tory , under royal George the Third .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="6">Many a time , I well remember , I have gazed with Childish awe</l>
     <l n="7">At the bullet-hole remaining in the sturdy oaken door ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="8">Turning round half-apprehensive ( recking not how time had fled )</l>
     <l n="9">Of the lurking , savage foeman from whose musket it was sped ..</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="10">Not far off , the barn , plethoric with the autumn 's harvest spoils ,</l>
     <l n="11">Holds the farmer 's well-earned trophies — the guerdon of his toils ;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="12">Filled the lofts with hay , sweet-scented , ravished from the meadows green ,</l>
     <l n="13">While beneath are stalled the cattle , with their quiet , drowsy mien .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="14">Deep and spacious are the grain-bins , brimming o'er with nature 's gold ;</l>
     <l n="15">Here are piles of yellow pumpkins on the barn-floor loosely rolled .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="16">Just below in deep recesses , safe from wintry frost chill ,</l>
     <l n="17">There are heaps of ruddy apples from the orchard the hill .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="18">Many a year has Grand'ther Baldwin in the old house dwelt in peace ,</l>
     <l n="19">As his hair each year grew whiter , he has seen his herds increase .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="20">Sturdy sons and comely daughters , growing up from childish plays ,</l>
     <l n="21">One by one have met life 's duties , and gone forth their several ways .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="22">Hushed the voice of childish laughter , hushed is childhood 's merry tone ,</l>

     <l n="38">Hushed the voice of childish laughter , hushed is childhood 's merry tone ,</l>
     <l n="39">By the fireside Grand'ther Baldwin and his good wife sit alone .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="21">
     <l n="40">Yet once within the twelvemonth , when the days are short and drear ,</l>
     <l n="41">And chill winds chant the requiem of the slowly fading year ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="22">
     <l n="42">When the autumn work is over , and the harvest gathered in ,</l>
     <l n="43">Once again the old house echoes to a long unwonted din .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="23">
     <l n="44">Logs of hickory blaze and crackle in the fireplace huge anti high ,</l>
     <l n="45">Curling wreaths of smoke mount upward to the gray November sky .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="24">
     <l n="46">Ruddy lads and smiling lasses , just let loose from schooldom 's cares ,</l>
     <l n="47">Patter , patter , race and clatter , up and down the great hall stairs .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="25">
     <l n="48">All the boys shall hold high revel ; all the girls shall have their way ,—</l>
     <l n="49">That 's the law at Grand'ther Baldwin 's upon each Thanksgiving Day .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="26">
     <l n="50">From from the parlor 's sacred precincts , hark ! a madder uproar yet ;</l>
     <l n="51">Roguish Charlie 's playing stage-coach , and the stage-coach has upset !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="27">
     <l n="52">Joe , black-eyed and laughter-loving , Grand'ther ' s specs his nose across ,</l>
     <l n="53">Gravely winks at brother Willie , who is gayly playing horse .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="28">
     <l n="54">Grandma 's face is fairly radiant ; Grand'ther knows not how to frown ,</l>
     <l n="55">though the children , in their frolic , turn the old house upside down .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="29">
     <l n="56">For the boys may hold high revel , and the girls must have their way ;</l>
     <l n="57">That 's the law at Grand'ther Baldwin 's upon each Thanksgiving Day .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="30">
     <l n="58">But the dinner — ah ! the dinner — words are feeble to portray</l>
     <l n="59">What a culinary triumph is achieved Thanksgiving Day !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="31">
     <l n="60">Fairly groans the board with dainties , but the turkey rules the roast ,</l>
     <l n="61">Aldermanic at the outset , at the last a fleshless ghost .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="32">
     <l n="62">Then the richness of the pudding , and the flavor of the pie ,</l>
     <l n="63">When you 've dined at Grandma Baldwin 's you will know as well as I .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="33">
     <l n="64">When , at length , the feast was ended , Grand'ther Baldwin bent his head ,</l>
     <l n="65">And , amid the solemn silence , with a reverent voice , he said :—</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="34">
     <l n="66">“ Now unto God , the Gracious One , we thanks and homage pay ,</l>
     <l n="67">Who guardeth us , and guideth us , and loveth us always !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="35">
     <l n="68">“ He scatters blessings in our paths , He giveth us increase ,</l>
     <l n="69">He crowns us with His kindnesses , and granteth us His peace .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="36">
     <l n="70">“ Unto himself , our wandering feet , we pray that He may draw ,</l>
     <l n="71">And may we strive , with faithful hearts , to keep His holy law ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="37">
     <l n="72">His simple words in silence died : a moment 's hush . And then</l>
     <l n="73">From all the listening hearts there rose a solemn-voiced Amen !</l>
    </lg>

    <head>ST. NICHOLAS .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">In the far-off Polar seas ,</l>
     <l n="2">Far beyond the Hebrides ,</l>
     <l n="3">Where the icebergs , towering high ,</l>
     <l n="4">Seem to pierce the wintry sky ,</l>
     <l n="5">And the fur-clad Esquimaux</l>
     <l n="6">Glides in sledges o'er the snow ,</l>
     <l n="7">Dwells St. Nick , the merry wight ,</l>
     <l n="8">Patron saint of Christmas night .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">Solid walls of massive ice ,</l>
     <l n="10">Bearing many a quaint device ,</l>
     <l n="11">Flanked by graceful turrets twain ,</l>
     <l n="12">Clear as clearest porcelain ,</l>
     <l n="13">Bearing at a lofty height</l>
     <l n="14">Christ 's pure cross in simple white ,</l>
     <l n="15">Carven with surpassing art</l>
     <l n="16">From an iceberg 's crystal heart .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="17">Here St. Nick , in royal state ,</l>
     <l n="18">Dwells , until December late</l>
     <l n="19">Clips the days at either end ,</l>
     <l n="20">And the nights at each extend ;</l>
     <l n="21">Then , with his attendant sprites ,</l>
     <l n="22">Scours the earth on wintry nights ,</l>
     <l n="23">Bringing home , in well-filled hands ,</l>
     <l n="24">Children 's gifts from many lands .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="25">Here are whistles , tops and toys ,</l>
     <l n="26">Meant to gladden little boys ;</l>
     <l n="27">Skates and sleds that soon will glide</l>
     <l n="28">O'er the ice or steep hill-side .</l>
     <l n="29">Here are dolls with flaxen curls ,</l>
     <l n="30">Sure to charm the little girls ;</l>
     <l n="31">Christmas books , with pictures gay ,</l>
     <l n="32">For this welcome holiday .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="33">In the court the reindeer wait ;</l>
     <l n="34">Filled the sledge with costly freight .</l>
     <l n="35">As the first faint shadow falls ,</l>
     <l n="36">Promptly from his icy halls</l>
     <l n="37">Steps St. Nick , and grasps the rein :</l>
     <l n="38">And afar , in measured time ,</l>
     <l n="39">Sounds the sleigh-bells ’ silver chime .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="40">Like an arrow from the bow</l>
     <l n="41">Speed the reindeer o'er the snow .</l>
     <l n="42">Onward ! Now the loaded sleigh</l>
     <l n="43">Skirts the shores of Hudson 's Bay .</l>
     <l n="44">Onward , till the stunted tree</l>
     <l n="45">Gains a loftier majesty ,</l>
     <l n="46">And the curling smoke-wreaths rise</l>
     <l n="47">Under less inclement skies .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="48">Built upon a hill-side steep</l>

     <l n="50">Up and down the lonely street</l>
     <l n="51">Sleepy watchmen pace their beat .</l>
     <l n="52">Little heeds them Santa Claus ;</l>
     <l n="53">Not for him are human laws .</l>
     <l n="54">With a leap he leaves the ground ,</l>

     <l n="60">Some with sweetmeats , some with toys ,</l>
     <l n="61">Gifts for girls , and gifts for boys ,</l>
     <l n="62">Mounts the chimney like a bird ,</l>

     <l n="72">Can you not some crumbs bestow</l>

    <head>BARBARA 'S COURTSHIP .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">‘ Tis just three months and eke a day ,</l>
     <l n="2">Since in the meadows , raking hay ,</l>
     <l n="3">On looking up I chanced to see</l>
     <l n="4">The manor 's lord , young Arnold Lee ,</l>
     <l n="5">With a loose hand on the rein ,</l>
     <l n="6">Riding slowly down the lane .</l>
     <l n="7">As I gazed with earnest look</l>
     <l n="8">On his face as on a book ,</l>
     <l n="9">As if conscious of the gaze ,</l>
     <l n="10">Suddenly he turned the rays</l>
     <l n="11">Of his brilliant eyes on me .</l>
     <l n="12">Then I looked down hastily ,</l>
     <l n="13">While my heart , like caged bird ,</l>
     <l n="14">Fluttered till it might be heard .</l>
     <l n="15">Foolish , foolish Barbara !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="16">We had never met before ,</l>
     <l n="17">He had been so long away ,</l>
     <l n="18">Visiting some foreign shore ,</l>
     <l n="19">I have heard my father say .</l>
     <l n="20">What in truth was he to me ,</l>
     <l n="21">Rich and handsome Arnold Lee ?</l>
     <l n="22">Fate had placed us far apart ;</l>
     <l n="23">Why , then , did my restless heart</l>
     <l n="24">Flutter when his careless glance</l>
     <l n="25">Fell on me by merest chance ?</l>
     <l n="26">Foolish , foolish Barbara !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="27">There are faces — are there not ?—</l>
     <l n="28">That can never be forgot .</l>
     <l n="29">Looks that seen but once impress</l>
     <l n="30">With peculiar vividness .</l>
     <l n="31">So it was with Arnold Lee .</l>
     <l n="32">Why it was I cannot say</l>
     <l n="33">That , through all the livelong day</l>
     <l n="34">He seemed ever near to me .</l>
     <l n="35">While I raked , as in a dream ,</l>
     <l n="36">Now the same place o'er and o'er ,</l>
     <l n="37">Till my little sister chid ,</l>
     <l n="38">And with full eyes opened wide ,</l>
     <l n="39">Much in wonder , gently cried ,</l>

     <l n="43">All the songsters are in tune ,</l>
     <l n="44">Pouring out their matin hymn .</l>
     <l n="45">All at once a conscious thrill</l>
     <l n="46">Led me , half against my will ,</l>
     <l n="47">To look up . Abashed I see</l>
     <l n="48">His dark eyes full fixed on me .</l>
     <l n="49">What he said I do not know ,</l>
     <l n="50">But his voice was soft and low ,</l>
     <l n="51">As he spoke in careless chat ,</l>
     <l n="52">Now of this and now of that ,</l>
     <l n="53">While the murmurous waves of sound</l>
     <l n="54">Wafted me a bliss profound .</l>
