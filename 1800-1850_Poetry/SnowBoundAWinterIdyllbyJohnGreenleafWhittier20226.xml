     <l n="2">The sun that brief December day</l>
     <l n="3">Rose cheerless over hills of gray ,</l>
     <l n="4">And , darkly circled , gave at noon</l>
     <l n="5">A sadder light than waning moon .</l>
     <l n="6">Slow tracing down the thickening sky</l>
     <l n="7">Its mute and ominous prophecy ,</l>

     <l n="15">The coming of the snow-storm told .</l>
     <l n="16">The wind blew east : we heard the roar</l>
     <l n="17">Of Ocean on his wintry shore ,</l>

     <l n="20">Meanwhile we did our nightly chores ,—</l>

     <l n="26">Impatient down the stanchion rows</l>
     <l n="27">The cattle shake their walnut bows ;</l>
     <l n="28">While , peering from his early perch</l>
     <l n="29">Upon the scaffold 's pole of birch ,</l>

     <l n="33">Unwarmed by any sunset light</l>

     <l n="82">Of rare Aladdin 's wondrous cave ,</l>
     <l n="83">And to our own his name we gave ,</l>

     <l n="123">As night drew on , and , from the crest</l>
     <l n="124">Of wooded knolls that ridged the west ,</l>
     <l n="125">The sun , a snow-blown traveller , sank</l>
