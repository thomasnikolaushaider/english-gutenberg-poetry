Not idler now are they Than when their cunning fashioner first blew The pith of music from them : Yet for you And me their notes are blown in many a way Lost in our murmurings for that old day That fared so well , without us .— Waken to The pipings here at hand :— The clear halloo Of truant-voices , and the roundelay The waters warble in the solitude Of blooming thickets , where the robin 's breast Sends up such ecstacy o'er dale and dell , Each tree top answers , till in all the wood There lingers not one squirrel in his nest Whetting his hunger on an empty shell . AT ZEKESBURY . The little town , as I recall it , was of just enough dignity and dearth of the same to be an ordinary county seat in Indiana — “ The Grand Old Hoosier State , ” as it was used to being howlingly referred to by the forensic stump orator from the old stand in the courthouse yard — a political campaign being the wildest delight that Zekesbury might ever hope to call its own . Through years the fitful happenings of the town and its vicinity went on the same — the same ! Annually about one circus ventured in , and vanished , and was gone , even as a passing trumpet-blast ; the usual rainy-season swelled the “ Crick , ” the driftage choking at “ the covered bridge , ” and backing water till the old road looked amphibious ; and crowds of curious townsfolk straggled down to look upon the watery wonder , and lean awe-struck above it , and spit in it , and turn mutely home again . The usual formula of incidents peculiar to an uneventful town and its vicinity : The countryman from “ Jessup 's Crossing , ” with the cornstalk coffin-measure , loped into town , his steaming little gray-and-red-flecked “ roadster ” gurgitating , as it were , with that mysterious utterance that ever has commanded and ever must evoke the wonder and bewilderment of every boy . The small-pox rumor became prevalent betimes , and the subtle aroma of the assafoetida-bag permeated the graded schools “ from turret to foundation-stone ; ” the still recurring exposé of the poor-house management ; the farm-hand , with the scythe across his shoulder , struck dead by lightning ; the long-drawn quarrel between the rival editors culminating in one of them assaulting the other with a “ sidestick , ” and the other kicking the one down stairs and thenceward ad libitum ; the tramp , suppositiously stealing a ride , found dead on the railroad ; the grand jury returning a sensational indictment against a bar-tender non est ; the Temperance outbreak ; the “ Revival ; ” the Church Festival ; and the “ Free Lectures on Phrenology , and Marvels of Mesmerism , ” at the town hall . It was during the time of the last-mentioned sensation , and directly through this scientific investigation , that I came upon two of the town 's most remarkable characters . And however meager my outline of them may prove , my material for the sketch is most accurate in every detail , and no deviation from the cold facts of the case shall influence any line of my report . For some years prior to this odd experience I had been connected with a daily paper at the state capitol ; and latterly a prolonged session of the legislature , where I specially reported , having told threateningly upon my health , I took both the advantage of a brief vacation , and the invitation of a young bachelor Senator , to get out of the city for awhile , and bask my respiratory organs in the revivifying rural air of Zekesbury — the home of my new friend . “ It 'll pay you to get out here , ” he said , cordially , meeting me at the little station , “ and I 'm glad you 've come , for you 'll find no end of odd characters to amuse you . ” And under the very pleasant sponsorship of my senatorial friend , I was placed at once on genial terms with half the citizens of the little town — from the shirt-sleeved nabob of the county office to the droll wag of the favorite loafing-place — the rules and by-laws of which resort , by the way , being rudely charcoaled on the wall above the cutter 's bench , and somewhat artistically culminating in an original dialectic legend which ran thus : F'rinstance , now whar some folks gits To relyin ’ on their wits . Ten to one they git too smart , And spile it all right at the start !— Feller wants to jest go slow And do his thinkin ’ first , you know :—— Ef I can n't think up somepin ’ good , I set still and chaw my cood ! And it was at this inviting rendezvous , two or three evenings following my arrival , that the general crowd , acting upon the random proposition of one of the boys , rose as a man and wended its hilarious way to the town hall . “ Phrenology , ” said the little , old , bald-headed lecturer and mesmerist , thumbing the egg-shaped head of a young man I remembered to have met that afternoon in some law office ; “ Phrenology , ” repeated the professor — “ or rather the term phrenology — is derived from two Greek words signifying mind and discourse ; hence we find embodied in phrenology-proper , the science of intellectual measurement , together with the capacity of intelligent communication of the varying mental forces and their flexibilities , etc ., &amp; c. The study , then , of phrenology is , to wholly simplify it — is , I say , the general contemplation of the workings of the mind as made manifest through the certain corresponding depressions and protuberances of the human skull , when , of course , in a healthy state of action and development , as we here find the conditions exemplified in the subject before us . ” Here the “ subject ” vaguely smiled . “ You recognize that mug , do n't you ? ” whispered my friend . “ It 's that coruscating young ass , you know , Hedrick — in Cummings ’ office — trying to study law and literature at the same time , and tampering with ‘ The Monster that Annually , ’ do n't you know ?— where we found the two young students scuffling round the office , and smelling of peppermint ?— Hedrick , you know , and Sweeney . Sweeney , the slim chap , with the pallid face , and frog-eyes , and clammy hands ! You remember I told you ‘ there was a pair of ‘ em ? ’ Well , they 're up to something here to-night . Hedrick , there on the stage in front ; and Sweeney — do n't you see ?— with the gang on the rear seats . ” “ Phrenology — again , ” continued the lecturer , “ is , we may say , a species of mental geography , as it were ; which — by a study of the skull — leads also to a study of the brain within , even as geology naturally follows the initial contemplation of the earth 's surface . The brain , thurfur , or intellectual retort , as we may say , natively exerts a molding influence on the skull contour ; thurfur is the expert in phrenology most readily enabled to accurately locate the multitudinous intellectual forces , and most exactingly estimate , as well , the sequent character of each subject submitted to his scrutiny . As , in the example before us — a young man , doubtless well known in your midst , though , I may say , an entire stranger to myself — I venture to disclose some characteristic trends and tendencies , as indicated by this phrenological depression and development of the skull-proper , as later we will show , through the mesmeric condition , the accuracy of our mental diagnosis . ” Throughout the latter part of this speech my friend nudged me spasmodically , whispering something which was jostled out of intelligent utterance by some inward spasm of laughter . “ In this head , ” said the Professor , straddling his malleable fingers across the young man 's bumpy brow — “ In this head we find Ideality large — abnormally large , in fact ; thurby indicating — taken in conjunction with a like development of the perceptive qualities — language following , as well , in the prominent eye — thurby indicating , I say , our subject as especially endowed with a love for the beautiful — the sublime — the elevating — the refined and delicate — the lofty and superb — in nature , and in all the sublimated attributes of the human heart and beatific soul . In fact , we find this young man possessed of such natural gifts as would befit him for the exalted career of the sculptor , the actor , the artist , or the poet — any ideal calling ; in fact , any calling but a practical , matter-of-fact vocation ; though in poetry he would seem to best succeed . ” “ Well , ” said my friend , seriously , “ he 's feeling for the boy ! ” Then laughingly : “ Hedrick has written some rhymes for the county papers , and Sweeney once introduced him , at an Old Settlers ’ Meeting , as ‘ The Best Poet in Center Township , ’ and never cracked a smile ! Always after each other that way , but the best friends in the world . Sweeney 's strong suit is elocution . He has a native ability that way by no means ordinary , but even that gift he abuses and distorts simply to produce grotesque , and oftentimes ridiculous effects . For instance , nothing more delights him than to ‘ lothfully ’ consent to answer a request , at The Mite Society , some evening , for ‘ an appropriate selection , ’ and then , with an elaborate introduction of the same , and an exalted tribute to the refined genius of the author , proceed with a most gruesome rendition of ‘ Alonzo The Brave and The Fair Imogene , ’ in a way to coagulate the blood and curl the hair of his fair listeners with abject terror . Pale as a corpse , you know , and with that cadaverous face , lit with those malignant-looking eyes , his slender figure , and his long , thin legs and arms and hands , and his whole diabolical talent and adroitness brought into play — why , I want to say to you , it 's enough to scare ‘ em to death ! Never a smile from him , though , till he and Hedrick are safe out into the night again — then , of course , they hug each other and howl over it like Modocs ! But pardon ; I 'm interrupting the lecture . Listen . ” “ A lack of continuity , however , ” continued the Professor , “ and an undue love of approbation , would , measurably , at least , tend to retard the young man 's progress toward the consummation of any loftier ambition , I fear ; yet as we have intimated , if the subject were appropriately educated to the need 's demand , he could doubtless produce a high order of both prose and poetry — especially the latter — though he could very illy bear being laughed at for his pains . ”</titlePart></docTitle>
    <epigraph>
     <p>“ He 's dead wrong there , ” said my friend ; “ Hedrick enjoys being laughed at ; he ‘ s used to it — gets fat on it ! ” “ He is fond of his friends , ” continued the Professor “ and the heartier they are the better ; might even be convivially inclined — if so tempted — but prudent — in a degree , ” loiteringly concluded the speaker , as though unable to find the exact bump with which to bolster up the last named attribute . The subject blushed vividly — my friend 's right eyelid dropped , and there was a noticeable , though elusive sensation throughout the audience .</p>

    <docImprint>“ But ! ” said the Professor , explosively , “ selecting a directly opposite subject , in conjunction with the study of the one before us [ turning to the group at the rear of the stage and beckoning ] , we may find a newer interest in the practical comparison of these subjects side by side . ” And the Professor pushed a very pale young man into position .</docImprint>
    <epigraph>
     <p>“ Sweeney ! ” whispered my friend , delightedly ; “ now look out ! ” “ In this subject , ” said the Professor , “ we find the practical business head . Square — though small — a trifle light at the base , in fact ; but well balanced at the important points at least ; thoughtful eyes — wide-awake — crafty — quick — restless — a policy eye , though not denoting language — unless , perhaps , mere business forms and direct statements . ” “ Fooled again ! ” whispered my friend ; “ and I 'm afraid the old man will fail to nest out the fact also that Sweeney is the cold-bloodedest guyer on the face of the earth , and with more diabolical resources than a prosecuting attorney ; the Professor ought to know this , too , by this time — for these same two chaps have been visiting the old man in his room at the hotel ;— that 's what I was trying to tell you awhile ago . The old sharp thinks he 's ‘ playing ’ the boys , is my idea ; but it 's the other way , or I lose my guess . ” “ Now , under the mesmeric influence — if the two subjects will consent to its administration , ” said the Professor , after some further tedious preamble , “ we may at once determine the fact of my assertions , as will be proved by their action while in this peculiar state . ” Here some apparent remonstrance was met with from both subjects , though amicably overcome by the Professor first manipulating the stolid brow and pallid front of the imperturbable Sweeney — after which the same mysterious ordeal was lothfully submitted to by Hedrick — though a noticeably longer time was consumed in securing his final loss of self-control . At last , however , this curious phenomenon was presented , and there before us stood the two swaying figures , the heads dropped back , the lifted hands , with thumb and finger-tips pressed lightly together , the eyelids languid and half closed , and the features , in appearance , wan and humid . “ Now , sir ! ” said the Professor , leading the limp Sweeney forward , and addressing him in a quick , sharp tone of voice .— “ Now , sir , you are a great contractor — own large factories , and with untold business interests . Just look out there ! [ pointing out across the expectant audience ] look there , and see the countless minions toiling servilely at your dread mandates . And yet — ha ! ha ! See ! see !— They recognize the avaricious greed that would thus grind them in the very dust ; they see , alas ! they see themselves half-clothed — half-fed , that you may glut your coffers . Half-starved , they listen to the wail of wife and babe , and , with eyes upraised in prayer , they see you rolling by in gilded coach , and swathed in silk attire . But — ha ! again ! Look — look ! they are rising in revolt against you ! Speak to them before too late ! Appeal to them — quell them with the promise of the just advance of wages they demand ! ” The limp figure of Sweeney took on something of a stately and majestic air . With a graceful and commanding gesture of the hand , he advanced a step or two ; then , after a pause of some seconds duration , in which the lifted face grew paler , as it seemed , and the eyes a denser black , he said : “ But yesterday I looked away O'er happy lands , where sunshine lay In golden blots , Inlaid with spots Of shade and wild forget-me-nots . ” The voice was low , but clear , and ever musical . The Professor started at the strange utterance , looked extremely confused , and , as the boisterous crowd cried “ Hear , hear ! ” he motioned the subject to continue , with some gasping comment interjected , which , if audible , would have run thus : “ My God ! It 's an inspirational poem ! ” “ My head was fair With flaxen hair — ” resumed the subject . “ Yoop-ee ! ” yelled an irreverent auditor . “ Silence ! silence ! ” commanded the excited Professor in a hoarse whisper ; then , turning enthusiastically to the subject — “ Go on , young man ! Go on !— ‘ Thy head-was fair-with flaxen hair — ’ ” “ My head was fair With flaxen hair , And fragrant breezes , faint and rare , And warm with drouth From out the south , Blew all my curls across my mouth . ” The speaker 's voice , exquisitely modulated , yet resonant as the twang of a harp , now seemed of itself to draw and hold each listener ; while a certain extravagance of gesticulation — a fantastic movement of both form and feature — seemed very near akin to fascination . And so flowed on the curious utterance : “ And , cool and sweet , My naked feet Found dewy pathways through the wheat ; And out again Where , down the lane , The dust was dimpled with the rain . ” In the pause following there was a breathlessness almost painful . The poem went on : “ But yesterday I heard the lay Of summer birds , when I , as they With breast and wing , All quivering With life and love , could only sing . “ My head was leant , Where , with it , blent A maiden 's , o'er her instrument ; While all the night , From vale to height , Was filled with echoes of delight . “ And all our dreams Were lit with gleams Of that lost land of reedy streams , Along whose brim Forever swim Pan 's lilies , laughing up at him . ” And still the inspired singer held rapt sway . “ It is wonderful ! ” I whispered , under breath . “ Of course it is ! ” answered my friend . “ But listen ; there is more : ” “ But yesterday !... O blooms of May , And summer roses — Where-away ? O stars above ; And lips of love , And all the honeyed sweets thereof ! “ O lad and lass . And orchard-pass , And briared lane , and daisied grass ! O gleam and gloom , And woodland bloom , And breezy breaths of all perfume !— “ No more for me Or mine shall be Thy raptures — save in memory ,— No more — no more — Till through the Door Of Glory gleam the days of yore . ” This was the evident conclusion of the remarkable utterance , and the Professor was impetuously fluttering his hands about the subject 's upward-staring eyes , stroking his temples , and snapping his fingers in his face . “ Well , ” said Sweeney , as he stood suddenly awakened , and grinning in an idiotic way , “ how did the old thing work ? ” And it was in the consequent hilarity and loud and long applause , perhaps , that the Professor was relieved from the explanation of this rather astounding phenomenon of the idealistic workings of a purely practical brain — or , as my impious friend scoffed the incongruity later , in a particularly withering allusion , as the “ blank-blanked fallacy , do n't you know , of staying the hunger of a howling mob by feeding ‘ em on Spring poetry ! ” The tumult of the audience did not cease even with the retirement of Sweeney , and cries of “ Hedrick ! Hedrick ! ” only subsided with the Professor 's high-keyed announcement that the subject was even then endeavoring to make himself heard , but could not until utter quiet was restored , adding the further appeal that the young man had already been a long time under the mesmeric spell , and ought not be so detained for an unnecessary period . “ See , ” he concluded , with an assuring wave of the hand toward the subject , “ see ; he is about to address you . Now , quiet !— utter quiet , if you please ! ” “ Great heavens ! ” exclaimed my friend , stiflingly ; “ Just look at the boy ! Get onto that position for a poet ! Even Sweeney has fled from the sight of him ! ” And truly , too , it was a grotesque pose the young man had assumed ; not wholly ridiculous either , since the dwarfed position he had settled into seemed more a genuine physical condition than an affected one . The head , back-tilted , and sunk between the shoulders , looked abnormally large , while the features of the face appeared peculiarly child-like — especially the eyes — wakeful and wide apart , and very bright , yet very mild and very artless ; and the drawn and cramped outline of the legs and feet , and of the arms and hands , even to the shrunken , slender-looking fingers , all combined to most strikingly convey to the pained senses the fragile frame and pixey figure of some pitiably afflicted child , unconscious altogether of the pathos of its own deformity . “ Now , mark the kuss , Horatio ! ” gasped my friend . At first the speaker 's voice came very low , and somewhat piping , too , and broken — an eerie sort of voice it was , of brittle and erratic timbre and undulant inflection . Yet it was beautiful . It had the ring of childhood in it , though the ring was not pure golden , and at times fell echoless . The spirit of its utterance was always clear and pure and crisp and cheery as the twitter of a bird , and yet forever ran an undercadence through it like a low-pleading prayer . Half garrulously , and like a shallow brook might brawl across a shelvy bottom , the rhythmic little changeling thus began : “ I 'm thist a little crippled boy , an ’ never goin ’ to grow An ’ git a great big man at all !— ‘ cause Aunty told me so . When I was thist a baby one't I falled out of the bed An ’ got ‘ The Curv'ture of the Spine ’ — ‘ at 's what the Doctor said . I never had no Mother nen — far my Pa run away An ’ dass n't come back here no more — ‘ cause he was drunk one day An ’ stobbed a man in thish-ere town , an ’ could n't pay his fine ! An ’ nen my Ma she died — an ’ I got ‘ Curv'ture of the Spine ! ’ ” A few titterings from the younger people in the audience marked the opening stanza , while a certain restlessness , and a changing to more attentive positions seemed the general tendency . The old Professor , in the meantime , had sunk into one of the empty chairs . The speaker went on with more gaiety : “ I 'm nine years old ! An ’ you can n't guess how much I weigh , I bet !— Last birthday I weighed thirty-three !— An ’ I weigh thirty yet ! I 'm awful little far my size — I 'm purt ’ nigh littler ‘ an Some babies is !— an ’ neighbors all calls me ‘ The Little Man ! ’ An ’ Doc one time he laughed an ’ said : ‘ I ‘ spect , first thing you know , You 'll have a little spike-tail coat an ’ travel with a show ! ’ An ’ nen I laughed — till I looked round an ’ Aunty was a-cryin ’ — Sometimes she acts like that , ‘ cause I got ‘ Curv'ture of the Spine ! ’ ” Just in front of me a great broad-shouldered countryman , with a rainy smell in his cumbrous overcoat , cleared his throat vehemently , looked startled at the sound , and again settled forward , his weedy chin resting on the knuckles of his hands as they tightly clutched the seat before him . And it was like being taken into a childish confidence as the quaint speech continued : “ I set — while Aunty 's washin ’ — on my little long-leg stool , An ’ watch the little boys an ’ girls ‘ a-skippin ’ by to school ; An ’ I peck on the winder , an ’ holler out an ’ say : ‘ Who wants to fight The Little Man ‘ at dares you all to-day ? ’ An ’ nen the boys climbs on the fence , an ’ little girls peeks through , An ’ they all says : ‘ Cause you 're so big , you think we 're ‘ feared o ’ you ! ’ An ’ nen they yell , an ’ shake their fist at me , like I shake mine — They 're thist in fun , you know , ‘ cause I got ‘ Curv'ture of the Spine ! ’ ” “ Well , ” whispered my friend , with rather odd irrelevance , I thought , “ of course you see through the scheme of the fellows by this time , do n't you ? ” “ I see nothing , ” said I , most earnestly , “ but a poor little wisp of a child that makes me love him so I dare not think of his dying soon , as he surely must ! There ; listen ! ” And the plaintive gaiety of the homely poem ran on : “ At evening , when the ironin 's done , an ’ Aunty 's fixed the fire , An ’ filled an ’ lit the lamp , an ’ trimmed the wick an ’ turned it higher , An ’ fetched the wood all in far night , an ’ locked the kitchen door , An ’ stuffed the ole crack where the wind blows in up through the floor — She sets the kittle on the coals , an ’ biles an ’ makes the tea , An ’ fries the liver an ’ the mush , an ’ cooks a egg far me ; An ’ sometimes — when I cough so hard — her elderberry wine Do n't go so bad far little boys with ‘ Curv'ture of the Spine ! ’ ” “ Look ! ” whispered my friend , touching me with his elbow . “ Look at the Professor ! ” “ Look at everybody ! ” said I . And the artless little voice went on again half quaveringly : “ But Aunty 's all so childish-like on my account , you see , I 'm ‘ most afeared she 'll be took down — an ’ ‘ at 's what bothers me !— ‘ Cause ef my good ole Aunty ever would git sick an ’ die , I do n't know what she 'd do in Heaven — till I come , by an ’ by :— Far she 's so ust to all my ways , an ’ ever'thing , you know , An ’ no one there like me , to nurse , an ’ worry over so !— ‘ Cause all the little childerns there 's so straight an ’ strong an ’ fine , They 's nary angel ‘ bout the place with ‘ Curv'ture of the Spine ! ’ ” The old Professor 's face was in his handkerchief ; so was my friend 's in his ; and so was mine in mine , as even now my pen drops and I reach for it again . I half regret joining the mad party that had gathered an hour later in the old law-office where these two graceless characters held almost nightly revel , the instigators and conniving hosts of a reputed banquet whose menu 's range confined itself to herrings , or “ blind robins , ” dried beef , and cheese , with crackers , gingerbread , and sometimes pie ; the whole washed down with anything but “ —— Wines that heaven knows when Had sucked the fire of some forgotten sun , And kept it through a hundred years of gloom Still glowing in a heart of ruby . ” But the affair was memorable . The old Professor was himself lured into it , and loudest in his praise of Hedrick 's realistic art ; and I yet recall him at the orgie 's height , excitedly repulsing the continued slurs and insinuations of the clammy-handed Sweeney , who , still contending against the old man 's fulsome praise of his more fortunate rival , at last openly declared that Hedrick was not a poet , not a genius , and in no way worthy to be classed in the same breath with himself — “ the gifted but unfortunate Sweeney , sir — the unacknowledged author , sir — ‘ y gad , sir !— of the two poems that held you spell-bound to-night ! ”</p>

     <p>John B. McKinney , Attorney and Counselor at Law , as his sign read , was , for many reasons , a fortunate man . For many other reasons he was not . He was chiefly fortunate in being , as certain opponents often strove to witheringly designate him , “ the son of his father , ” since that sound old gentleman was the wealthiest farmer in that section , with but one son and heir to , in time , supplant him in the role of “ county god , ” and haply perpetuate the prouder title of “ the biggest tax-payer on the assessment list . ” And this fact , too , fortunate as it would seem , was doubtless the indirect occasion of a liberal percentage of all John 's misfortunes . From his earliest school-days in the little town , up to his tardy graduation from a distant college , the influence of his father 's wealth invited his procrastination , humored its results , encouraged the laxity of his ambition , “ and even now , ” as John used , in bitter irony , to put it , “ it is aiding and abetting me in the ostensible practice of my chosen profession , a listless , aimless undetermined man of forty , and a confirmed bachelor at that ! ” At the utterance of this self-depreciating statement , John generally jerked his legs down from the top of his desk ; and , rising and kicking his chair back to the wall , he would stump around his littered office till the manilla carpet steamed with dust . Then he would wildly break away , seeking refuge either in the open street , or in his room at the old-time tavern , The Eagle House , “ where , ” he would say , “ I have lodged and boarded , I do solemnly asseverate , for a long , unbroken , middle-aged eternity of ten years , and can yet assert , in the words of the more fortunately-dying Webster , that ‘ I still live ! ’ ”</p>
     <p>Extravagantly satirical as he was at times , John had always an indefinable drollery about him that made him agreeable company to his friends , at least ; and such an admiring friend he had constantly at hand in the person of Bert Haines . Both were Bohemians in natural tendency , and , though John was far in Bert 's advance in point of age , he found the young man “ just the kind of a fellow to have around ; ” while Bert , in turn , held his senior in profound esteem — looked up to him , in fact , and in even his eccentricities strove to pattern after him . And so it was , when summer days were dull and tedious , these two could muse and doze the hours away together ; and when the nights were long , and dark , and deep , and beautiful , they could drift out in the noon-light of the stars , and with “ the soft complaining flute ” and “ warbling lute , ” “ lay the pipes , ” as John would say , for their enduring popularity with the girls ! And it was immediately subsequent to one of these romantic excursions , when the belated pair , at two o'clock in the morning , had skulked up a side stairway of the old hotel , and gained John 's room , with nothing more serious happening than Bert falling over a trunk and smashing his guitar ,— just after such a night of romance and adventure it was that , in the seclusion of John 's room , Bert had something of especial import to communicate .</p>
     <p>“ Mack , ” he said , as that worthy anathematized a spiteful match , and then sucked his finger .</p>
     <p>“ Blast the all-fired old torch ! ” said John , wrestling with the lamp-flue , and turning on a welcome flame at last . “ Well , you said ‘ Mack ! ’ Why do n't you go on ? And do n't bawl at the top of your lungs , either . You 've already succeeded in waking every boarder in the house with that guitar , and you want to make amends now by letting them go to sleep again ! ”</p>
     <p>“ But my dear fellow , ” said Bert , with forced calmness , “ you 're the fellow that 's making all the noise — and — ”</p>
     <p>“ Why , you howling dervish ! ” interrupted John , with a feigned air of pleased surprise and admiration . “ But let 's drop controversy . Throw the fragments of your guitar in the wood-box there , and proceed with the opening proposition . ”</p>
     <p>“ What I was going to say was this , ” said Bert , with a half-desperate enunciation ; “ I 'm getting tired of this way of living — clean , dead-tired , and fagged out , and sick of the whole artificial business ! ”</p>
     <p>“ Oh , yes ! ” exclaimed John , with a towering disdain , “ you need n't go any further ! I know just what malady is throttling you . It 's reform — reform ! You 're going to ‘ turn over a new leaf , ’ and all that , and sign the pledge , and quit cigars , and go to work , and pay your debts , and gravitate back into Sunday-School , where you can make love to the preacher 's daughter under the guise of religion , and desecrate the sanctity of the innermost pale of the church by confessions at Class of your ‘ thorough conversion ! ’ Oh , you 're going to — ”</p>
     <p>“ No , but I 'm going to do nothing of the sort , ” interrupted Bert , resentfully . “ What I mean — if you 'll let me finish — is , I 'm getting too old to be eternally undignifying myself with this ‘ singing of midnight strains under Bonnybell 's window panes , ’ and too old to be keeping myself in constant humiliation and expense by the borrowing and stringing up of old guitars , together with the breakage of the same , and the general wear-and-tear on a constitution that is slowly being sapped to its foundations by exposure in the night-air and the dew . ” “ And while you receive no further compensation in return , ” said John , “ than , perhaps , the coy turning up of a lamp at an upper casement where the jasmine climbs ; or an exasperating patter of invisible palms ; or a huge dank wedge of fruit-cake shoved at you by the old man , through a crack in the door . ”</p>
     <p>“ Yes , and I 'm going to have my just reward , is what I mean , ” said Bert , “ and exchange the lover 's life for the benedict 's . Going to hunt out a good , sensible girl and marry her . ” And as the young man concluded this desperate avowal he jerked the bow of his cravat into a hard knot , kicked his hat under the bed , and threw himself on the sofa like an old suit .</p>
     <p>John stared at him with absolute compassion . “ Poor devil , ” he said , half musingly , “ I know just how he feels —</p>
     <lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">‘ Ring in the wind his wedding chimes ,</l>
       <l n="2">Smile , villagers , at every door ;</l>
       <l n="3">Old church-yards stuffed with buried crimes ,</l>
       <l n="4">Be clad in sunshine o'er and o'er .— ’ ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="5">“ Oh , here ! ” exclaimed the wretched Bert , jumping to his feet ; “ let up</l>
       <l n="6">on that dismal recitative . It would make a dog howl to hear that ! ”</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>“ Then you ‘ let up ’ on that suicidal talk of marrying , ” replied John , “ and all that harangue of incoherency about your growing old . Why , my dear fellow , you 're at least a dozen years my junior , and look at me ! ” and John glanced at himself in the glass with a feeble pride , noting the gray sparseness of his side-hair , and its plaintive dearth on top . “ Of course I 've got to admit , ” he continued , “ that my hair is gradually evaporating ; but for all that , I 'm ‘ still in the ring , ’ do n't you know ; as young in society , for the matter of that , as yourself ! And this is just the reason why I do n't want you to blight every prospect in your life by marrying at your age — especially a woman — I mean the kind of woman you 'd be sure to fancy at your age . ”</p>
     <lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">“ Did n't I say ‘ a good , sensible girl ’ was the kind I had selected ? ”</l>
       <l n="2">Bert remonstrated .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="3">“ Oh ! ” exclaimed John , “ you 've selected her , then ?— and without one</l>
       <l n="4">word to me ! ” he ended , rebukingly .</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>“ Well , hang it all ! ” said Bert , impatiently ; “ I knew how you were , and just how you 'd talk me out of it ; and I made up my mind that for once , at least , I 'd follow the dictations of a heart that — however capricious in youthful frivolties — should beat , in manhood , loyal to itself and loyal to its own affinity . ”</p>
     <p>“ Go it ! Fire away ! Farewell , vain world ! ” exclaimed the excited John .— “ Trade your soul off for a pair of ear-bobs and a button-hook — a hank of jute hair and a box of lily-white ! I 've buried not less than ten old chums this way , and here 's another nominated for the tomb . ”</p>
     <p>“ But you 've got no reason about you , ” began Bert ,— “ I want to ” —</p>
     <p>“ And so do I ‘ want to , ’ ” broke in John , finally ,— “ I want to get some sleep .— So ‘ register ’ and come to bed .— And lie up on edge , too , when you do come — ‘ cause this old catafalque-of-a-bed is just about as narrow as your views of single blessedness ! Peace ! Not another word ! Pile in ! Pile in ! I 'm three-parts sick , anyhow , and I want rest ! ” And very truly he spoke .</p>
     <p>It was a bright morning when the slothful John was aroused by a long , vociferous pounding on the door . He started up in bed to find himself alone — the victim of his wrathful irony having evidently risen and fled away while his pitiless tormentor slept — “ Doubtless to at once accomplish that nefarious intent as set forth by his unblushing confession of last night , ” mused the miserable John . And he ground his fingers in the corners of his swollen eyes , and leered grimly in the glass at the feverish orbs , blood-shotten , blurred and aching .</p>
     <p>The pounding on the door continued . John looked at his watch ; it was only 8 o'clock .</p>
     <p>“ Hi , there ! ” he called viciously . “ What do you mean , anyhow ? ” he went on , elevating his voice again ; “ shaking a man out of bed when he 's just dropping into his first sleep ? ”</p>
     <p>“ I mean that you 're going to get up ; that 's what ! ” replied a firm female voice . “ It 's 8 o'clock , and I want to put your room in order ; and I 'm not going to wait all day about it , either ! Get up and go down to your breakfast , and let me have the room ! ” And the clamor at the door was industriously renewed .</p>
     <p>“ Say ! ” called John , querulously , hurrying on his clothes , “ Say ! you ! ”</p>
     <p>“ There 's no ‘ say ’ about it ! ” responded the determined voice : “ I 've heard about you and your ways around this house , and I 'm not going to put up with it ! You 'll not lie in bed till high noon when I 've got to keep your room in proper order ! ”</p>
     <p>“ Oh ho ! ” bawled John , intelligently : “ reckon you 're the new invasion here ? Doubtless you 're the girl that 's been hanging up the new window-blinds that wo n't roll , and disguising the pillows with clean slips , and ‘ hennin ’ round among my books and papers on the table here , and ageing me generally till I do n't know my own handwriting by the time I find it ! Oh , yes ! you 're going to revolutionize things here ; you 're going to introduce promptness , and system , and order . See you 've even filled the wash-pitcher and tucked two starched towels through the handle . Have n't got any tin towels , have you ? I rather like this new soap , too ! So solid and durable , you know ; warranted not to raise a lather . Might as well wash one 's hands with a door-knob ! ” And as John 's voice grumbled away into the sullen silence again , the determined voice without responded : “ Oh , you can growl away to your heart 's content , Mr. McKinney , but I want you to distinctly understand that I 'm not going to humor you in any of your old bachelor , sluggardly , slovenly ways , and whims and notions . And I want you to understand , too , that I 'm not hired help in this house , nor a chambermaid , nor anything of the kind . I 'm the landlady here ; and I 'll give you just ten minutes more to get down to your breakfast , or you 'll not get any — that 's all ! ” And as the reversed cuff John was in the act of buttoning slid from his wrist and rolled under the dresser , he heard a stiff rustling of starched muslin flouncing past the door , and the quick italicized patter of determined gaiters down the hall .</p>
     <p>“ Look here , ” said John to the bright-faced boy in the hotel office , a half hour later . “ It seems the house here 's been changing hands again . ”</p>
     <p>“ Yes , sir , ” said the boy , closing the cigar case , and handing him a lighted match . “ Well , the new landlord , whoever he is , ” continued John , patronizingly , “ is a good one . Leastwise , he knows what 's good to eat , and how to serve it . ”</p>
     <p>The boy laughed timidly ,— “ It aint a landlord , ’ though — it 's a landlady ; it 's my mother . ”</p>
     <p>“ Ah , ” said John , dallying with the change the boy had pushed toward him . “ Your mother , eh ? ” And where 's your father ? ”</p>
     <p>“ He 's dead , ” said the boy .</p>
     <p>“ And what 's this for ? ” abruptly asked John , examining his change .</p>
     <p>“ That 's your change , ” said the boy : “ You got three for a quarter , and gave me a half . ”</p>
     <p>“ Well , you just keep it , ” said John , sliding back the change . “ It 's for good luck , you know , my boy . Same as drinking your long life and prosperity . And , Oh yes , by the way , you may tell your mother I 'll have a friend to dinner with me to-day . ”</p>
     <p>“ Yes , sir , and thank you , sir , ” said the beaming boy .</p>
     <p>“ Handsome boy ! ” mused John , as he walked down street . “ Takes that from his father , though , I 'll wager my existence ! ”</p>
     <p>Upon his office desk John found a hastily written note . It was addressed in the well-known hand of his old chum . He eyed the missive apprehensively , and there was a positive pathos in his voice as he said aloud , “ It 's our divorce . I feel it ! ” The note , headed , “ At the Office , 4 in Morning , ” ran like this :</p>
     <p>“ Dear Mack — I left you slumbering so soundly that , by noon , when you waken , I hope , in your refreshed state , you will look more tolerantly on my intentions as partially confided to you this night . I will not see you here again to say good-bye . I wanted to , but was afraid to ‘ rouse the sleeping lion . ’ I will not close my eyes to-night — fact is , I have n't time . Our serenade at Josie 's was a pre-arranged signal by which she is to be ready and at the station for the 5 morning train . You may remember the lighting of three consecutive matches at her window before the igniting of her lamp . That meant , ‘ Thrice dearest one , I 'll meet thee at the depot at 4 : 30 sharp . ’ So , my dear Mack , this is to inform you that , even as you read , Josie and I have eloped . It is all the old man 's fault , yet I forgive him . Hope he 'll return the favor . Josie predicts he will , inside of a week — or two weeks , anyhow . Good-bye , Mack , old boy ; and let a fellow down as easy as you can .</p>
     <p>Affectionately ,</p>

      <head>BERT . ”</head>
      <head>“ Heavens ! ” exclaimed John , stifling the note in his hand and stalking tragically around the room . “ Can it be possible that I have nursed a frozen viper ? An ingrate ? A wolf in sheep 's clothing ? An orang-outang in gent 's furnishings ? ”</head>
       <l n="1">“ Was you callin ’ me , sir ? ” asked a voice at the door . It was the</l>
       <l n="2">janitor .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>“ No ! ” thundered John ; “ Quit my sight ! get out of my way ! No , no , Thompson , I do n't mean that , ” he called after him . “ Here 's a half dollar for you , and I want you to lock up the office , and tell anybody that wants to see me that I 've been set upon , and sacked and assassinated in cold blood ; and I 've fled to my father 's in the country , and am lying there in the convulsions of dissolution , babbling of green fields and running brooks , and thirsting for the life of every woman that comes in gunshot ! ” And then , more like a confirmed invalid than a man in the strength and pride of his prime , he crept down into the street again , and thence back to his hotel .</p>
     <p>Dejectedly and painfully climbing to his room , he encountered , on the landing above , a little woman in a jaunty dusting-cap and a trim habit of crisp muslin . He tried to evade her , but in vain . She looked him squarely in the face — occasioning him the dubious impression of either needing shaving very badly , or having egg-stains on his chin .</p>
     <p>“ You 're the gentleman in No . 11 , I believe ? ” she said .</p>
     <p>He nodded confusedly .</p>
     <p>“ Mr. McKinney is your name , I think ? ” she queried , with a pretty elevation of the eyebrows .</p>
     <p>“ Yes , ma'am , ” said John , rather abjectly . “ You see , ma'am — But I beg pardon , ” he went on stammeringly , and with a very awkward bow — “ I beg pardon , but I am addressing — ah — the — ah — the — ”</p>
     <p>“ You are addressing the new landlady , ” she interpolated , pleasantly . “ Mrs. Miller is my name . I think we should be friends , Mr. McKinney , since I hear that you are one of the oldest patrons of the house . ”</p>
     <p>“ Thank you — thank you ! ” said John , completely embarrassed . “ Yes , indeed !— ha , ha . Oh , yes — yes — really , we must be quite old friends , I assure you , Mrs .— Mrs .— ”</p>
     <p>“ Mrs. Miller , ” smilingly prompted the little woman .</p>
     <p>“ Yes , ah , yes ,— Mrs. Miller . Lovely morning , Mrs. Miller , ” said John , edging past her and backing toward his room .</p>
     <p>But as Mrs. Miller was laughing outright , for some mysterious reason , and gave no affirmation in response to his proposition as to the quality of the weather , John , utterly abashed and nonplussed , darted into his room and closed the door . “ Deucedly extraordinary woman ! ” he thought ; “ wonder what 's her idea ! ”</p>
     <p>He remained locked in his room till the dinner-hour ; and , when he promptly emerged for that occasion , there was a very noticeable improvement in his personal appearance , in point of dress , at least , though there still lingered about his smoothly-shaven features a certain haggard , care-worn , anxious look that would not out .</p>
     <p>Next his own place at the table he found a chair tilted forward , as though in reservation for some honored guest . What did it mean ? Oh , he remembered now . Told the boy to tell his mother he would have a friend to dine with him . Bert — and , blast the fellow ! he was , doubtless , dining then with a far preferable companion — his wife — in a palace-car on the P ., C. &amp; St. L ., a hundred miles away . The thought was maddening . Of course , now , the landlady would have material for a new assault . And how could he avert it ? A despairing film blurred his sight for the moment — then the eyes flashed daringly . “ I will meet it like a man ! ” he said , mentally — “ like a State 's Attorney ,— I will invite it ! Let her do her worst ! ”</p>
     <p>He called a servant , directing some message in an undertone .</p>
     <p>“ Yes , sir , ” said the agreeable servant , “ I 'll go right away , sir , ” and left the room .</p>
     <p>Five minutes elapsed , and then a voice at his shoulder startled him :</p>
     <p>“ Did you send for me , Mr. McKinney ? What is it I can do ? ”</p>
     <p>“ You are very kind , Mrs .— Mrs .— ”</p>
     <p>“ Mrs. Miller , ” said the lady , with a smile that he remembered .</p>
     <p>“ Now , please spare me even the mildest of rebukes . I deserve your censure , but I can n't stand it — I can n't positively ! ” and there was a pleading look in John 's lifted eyes that changed the little woman 's smile to an expression of real solicitude . “ I have sent for you , ” continued John , “ to ask of you three great favors . Please be seated while I enumerate them . First — I want you to forgive and forget that ill-natured , uncalled-for grumbling of mine this morning when you wakened me . ”</p>
     <p>“ Why , certainly , ” said the landlady , again smiling , though quite seriously .</p>
     <p>“ I thank you , ” said John , with dignity . “ And , second , ” he continued — “ I want your assurance that my extreme confusion and awkwardness on the occasion of our meeting later were rightly interpreted . ”</p>
     <p>“ Certainly — certainly , ” said the landlady , with the kindliest sympathy .</p>
     <p>“ I am grateful — utterly , ” said John , with newer dignity . “ And then , ” he went on ,— after informing you that it is impossible for the best friend I have in the world to be with me at this hour , as intended , I want you to do me the very great honor of dining with me . Will you ? ”</p>
     <p>“ Why , certainly , ” said the charming little landlady — “ and a thousand thanks beside ! But tell me something of your friend , ” she continued , as they were being served . “ What is he like — and what is his name — and where is he ? ”</p>
     <p>“ Well , ” said John , warily ,— “ he 's like all young fellows of his age . He 's quite young , you know — not over thirty , I should say — a mere boy , in fact , but clever — talented — versatile . ”</p>
     <p>“ — Unmarried , of course , ” said the chatty little woman .</p>
     <p>“ Oh , yes ! ” said John , in a matter-of-course tone — but he caught himself abruptly — then stared intently at his napkin — glanced evasively at the side-face of his questioner , and said ,— “ Oh yes ! Yes , indeed ! He 's unmarried .— Old bachelor like myself , you know . Ha ! Ha ! ”</p>
     <p>“ So he 's not like the young man here that distinguished himself last night ? ” said the little woman , archly .</p>
     <p>The fork in John 's hand , half-lifted to his lips , faltered and fell back toward his plate .</p>
     <p>“ Why , what 's that ? ” said John , in a strange voice ; “ I had n't heard anything about it — I mean I have n't heard anything about any young man . What was it ? ”</p>
     <p>“ Have n't heard anything about the elopement ? ” exclaimed the little woman , in astonishment .— “ Why , it 's been the talk of the town all morning . Elopement in high life — son of a grain-dealer , name of Hines , or Himes , or something , and a preacher 's daughter — Josie somebody — did n't catch her last name . Wonder if you do n't know the parties — Why , Mr. McKinney , are you ill ? ”</p>
     <p>“ Oh , no — not at all ! ” said John : “ Do n't mention it . Ha — ha ! Just eating too rapidly , that 's all . Go on with — you were saying that Bert and Josie had really eloped . ”</p>
     <p>“ What ‘ Bert ’ ? ” asked the little woman quickly .</p>
     <p>“ Why , did I say Bert ? ” said John , with a guilty look . “ I meant Haines , of course , you know — Haines and Josie .— And did they really elope ? ”</p>
     <p>“ That 's the report , ” answered the little woman , as though deliberating some important evidence ; “ and they say , too , that the plot of the runaway was quite ingenious . It seems the young lovers were assisted in their flight by some old fellow — friend of the young man 's — Why , Mr. McKinney , you are ill , surely ? ”</p>
     <p>John 's face was ashen .</p>
     <p>“ No — no ! ” he gasped , painfully : “ Go on — go on ! Tell me more about the — the — the old fellow — the old reprobate ! And is he still at large ? ”</p>
     <p>“ Yes , ” said the little womon , anxiously regarding the strange demeanor of her companion . “ They say , though , that the law can do nothing with him , and that this fact only intensifies the agony of the broken-hearted parents — for it seems they have , till now , regarded him both as a gentleman and family friend in whom ” —</p>
     <p>“ I really am ill , ” moaned John , waveringly rising to his feet ; “ but I beg you not to be alarmed . Tell your little boy to come to my room , where I will retire at once , if you 'll excuse me , and send for my physician . It is simply a nervous attack . I am often troubled so ; and only perfect quiet and seclusion restores me . You have done me a great honor , Mrs . ” — ( “ Mrs .— Miller , ” sighed the sympathetic little woman ) — “ Mrs. Miller ,— and I thank you more than I have words to express . ” He bowed limply , turned through a side door opening on a stair , and tottered to his room .</p>
     <p>During the three weeks ’ illness through which he passed , John had every attention — much more , indeed , than he had consciousness to appreciate . For the most part his mind wandered , and he talked of curious things , and laughed hysterically , and serenaded mermaids that dwelt in grassy seas of dew , and were bald-headed like himself . He played upon a fourteen-jointed flute of solid gold , with diamond holes , and keys carved out of thawless ice . His old father came at first to take him home ; but he could not be moved , the doctor said .</p>
     <p>Two weeks of John 's illness had worn away , when a very serious looking young man , in a traveling duster , and a high hat , came up the stairs to see him . A handsome young lady was clinging to his arm . It was Bert and Josie . She had guessed the very date of their forgiveness . John wakened even clearer in mind than usual that afternoon . He recognized his old chum at a glance , and Josie — now Bert 's wife . Yes , he comprehended that . He was holding a hand of each when another figure entered . His thin , white fingers loosened their clasp , and he held a hand toward the new comer . “ Here , ” he said , “ is my best friend in the world — Bert , you and Josie will love her , I know ; for this is Mrs .— Mrs . ” — “ Mrs. Miller , ” said the radiant little woman .— “ Yes ,— Mrs. Miller , ” said John , very proudly .</p>

       <l n="69">Through the town 's pent streets , and the sick child 's room ,</l>

       <l n="1">William Williams his name was — or so he said ;— Bill Williams they</l>
       <l n="2">called him , and them ‘ at knowed him best called him Bill Bills .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>The first I seed o ’ Bills was about two weeks after he got here . The Settlement was n't nothin ’ but a baby in them days , far I mind ‘ at old Ezry Sturgiss had jist got his saw and griss-mill a-goin ’ , and Bills had come along and claimed to know all about millin ’ , and got a job with him ; and millers in them times was wanted worse'n congersshYpppHeNmen , and I reckon got better wages ; far afore Ezry built , ther was n't a dust o ’ meal er flour to be had short o ’ the White Water , better'n sixty mild from here , the way we had to fetch it . And they used to come to Ezry 's far ther grindin ’ as far as that ; and one feller I knowed to come from what used to be the old South Fork , over eighty mild from here , and in the wettest , rainyest weather ; and mud ! Law !</p>
     <p>Well , this-here Bills was a-workin ’ far Ezry at the time — part the time a-grindin ’ , and part the time a-lookin ’ after the sawin ’ , and gittin ’ out timber and the like . Bills was a queer-lookin ’ feller , shore ! About as tall a build man as Tom Carter — but of course you do n't know nothin ’ o ’ Tom Carter . A great big hulk of a feller , Tom was ; and as far back as Fifty-eight used to make his brags that he could cut and put up his seven cord a day .</p>
     <p>Well , what give Bills this queer look , as I was a-goin ’ on to say , was a great big ugly scar a-runnin ’ from the corner o ’ one eye clean down his face and neck , and I do n't know how far down his breast — awful lookin ’ ; and he never shaved , and ther was n't a hair a-growin ’ in that scar , and it looked like a — some kind o ’ pizen snake er somepin ’ a crawlin ’ in the grass and weeds . I never seed sich a ’ out-an ’ - out onry-lookin ’ chap , and I 'll never fergit the first time I set eyes on him .</p>
     <p>Steve and me — Steve was my youngest brother ; Steve 's be'n in Californy now far , le ’ me see ,— well , anyways , I reckon , over thirty year .— Steve was a-drivin ’ the team at the time — I allus let Steve drive ; ‘ peared like Steve was made a-purpose far hosses . The beatin'est hand with hosses ‘ at ever you did see-an ’ - I-know ! W'y , a hoss , after he got kind o ’ used to Steve a-handlin ’ of him , would do anything far him ! And I 've knowed that boy to swap far hosses ‘ at cou'dn ' t hardly make a shadder ; and , afore you knowed it , Steve would have ‘ em a-cavortin ’ around a-lookin ’ as peert and fat and slick !</p>
     <p>Well , we 'd come over to Ezry 's far some grindin ’ that day ; and Steve wanted to price some lumber far a house , intendin ’ to marry that Fall — and would a-married , I reckon , ef the girl had n't a-died jist as she 'd got her weddin ’ clothes done , and that set hard on Steve far awhile . Yit he rallied , you know , as a youngster will ; but he never married , someway — never married . Reckon he never found no other woman he could love well enough , ‘ less it was — well , no odds .— The Good Bein 's jedge o ’ what 's best far each and all .</p>
     <p>We lived then about eight mild from Ezry 's , and it tuck about a day to make the trip ; so you kin kind o ’ git an idee o ’ how the roads was in them days .</p>
     <p>Well , on the way over I noticed Steve was mighty quiet-like , but I did n't think nothin ’ of it , tel at last he says , says he , “ Tom , I want you to kind o ’ keep an eye out far Ezry 's new hand , ” meanin Bills . And then I kind o ’ suspicioned somepin ’ o ’ nother was up betwixt ‘ em ; and shore enough ther was , as I found out afore the day was over .</p>
     <p>I knowed ‘ at Bills was a mean sort of a man , from what I 'd heerd . His name was all over the neighborhood afore he 'd be'n here two weeks .</p>
     <p>In the first place , he come in a suspicious sort o ’ way . Him and his wife , and a little baby only a few months old , come through in a kivvered wagon with a fambly a-goin ’ som'ers in The Illinoy ; and they stopped at the mill , far some meal er somepin ’ , and Bills got to talkin ’ with Ezry ‘ bout millin ’ , and one thing o ’ nother , and said he was expeerenced some ‘ bout a mill hisse'f , and told Ezry ef he 'd give him work he 'd stop ; said his wife and baby was n't strong enough to stand trav'lin ’ , and ef Ezry 'd give him work he was ready to lick into it then and there ; said his woman could pay her board by sewin ’ and the like , tel they got ahead a little ; and then , ef he liked the neighberhood , he said he 'd as leave settle there as anywheres ; he was huntin ’ a home , he said , and the outlook kind o ’ struck him , and his woman railly needed rest , and was n't strong enough to go much furder . And old Ezry kind o ’ tuck pity on the feller ; and havin ’ houseroom to spare , and railly in need of a good hand at the mill , he said all right ; and so the feller stopped and the wagon druv ahead and left ‘ em ; and they did n't have no things ner nothin ’ — not even a cyarpet-satchel , ner a stitch o ’ clothes , on'y what they had on their backs . And I think it was the third er fourth day after Bills stopped ‘ at he whirped Tomps Burk , the bully o ’ here them days , tel you would  n't a-knowed him !</p>
     <p>Well , I 'd heerd o ’ this , and the fact is I 'd made up my mind ‘ at Bills was a bad stick , and the place was  n't none the better far his bein ’ here . But , as I was a-goin ’ on to say ,— as Steve and me driv up to the mill , I ketched sight o ’ Bills the first thing , a-lookin ’ out o ’ where some boards was knocked off , jist over the worter-wheel ; and he knowed Steve — I could see that by his face ; and he hollered somepin ’ , too , but what it was I could n't jist make out , far the noise o ’ the wheel ; but he looked to me as ef he 'd hollered somepin ’ mean a-purpose so 's Steve would n't hear it , and he 'd have the consolation o ’ knowin ’ ‘ at he 'd called Steve some onry name ‘ thout givin ’ him a chance to take it up . Steve was allus quiet like , but ef you raised his dander one't — and you could do that ‘ thout much trouble , callin ’ him names er somepin ’ , particular ’ anything ‘ bout his mother . Steve loved his mother — allus loved his mother , and would fight far her at the drap o ’ the hat . And he was her favo-rite — allus a-talkin ’ o ’ “ her boy , Steven , ” as she used to call him , and so proud of him , and so keerful of him allus , when he ‘ d be sick er anything ; nuss him like a baby , she would .</p>
     <p>So when Bills hollered , Steve did n't pay no attention ; and I said nothin ’ , o ’ course , and did n't let on like I noticed him . So we druv round to the south side and hitched ; and Steve ‘ lowed he 'd better feed ; so I left him with the hosses and went into the mill .</p>
     <p>They was jist a-stoppin ’ far dinner . Most of ‘ em brought ther dinners — lived so far away , you know . The two Smith boys lived on what used to be the old Warrick farm , five er six mild , anyhow , from wher ’ the mill stood . Great stout fellers , they was ; and little Jake , the father of ‘ em , was n't no man at all — not much bigger'n you , I rickon . Le ’ me see , now :— Ther was Tomps Burk , Wade Elwood , and Joe and Ben Carter , and Wesley Morris , John Coke — wiry little cuss , he was , afore he got his leg sawed off — and Ezry , and — Well , I do n't jist mind all the boys — ‘ s a long time ago , and I never was much of a hand far names .— Now , some folks 'll hear a name and never fergit it , but I can n't boast of a good ricollection , ‘ specially o ’ names ; and far the last thirty year my mem'ry ' s be'n ahYpppHeNfailin ’ me , ever sence a spell o ’ fever ‘ at I brought on onc't — fever and rheumatiz together . You see , I went a-sainin ’ with a passel o ’ the boys , fool-like , and let my clothes freeze on me a-comin ’ home . Wy , my breeches was like stove-pipes when I pulled ‘ em off . ‘ Ll , ef I did n't pay far that spree ! Rheumatiz got a holt o ’ me and helt me there flat o ’ my back far eight weeks , and could n't move hand er foot ‘ thout a-hollerin ’ like a ’ Injun . And I 'd a-be'n there yit , I reckon , ef it had  n't a-be'n far a ’ old hoss-doctor , name o ’ Jones ; and he gits a lot o ’ sod and steeps it in hot whisky and pops it on me , and I'llhYpppHeNbehYpppHeNswitchedhYpppHeNtohYpppHeNdeath ef it did n't cuore me up , far all I laughed and told him I 'd better take the whisky inardly and let him keep the grass far his doctor bill . But that 's nuther here ner there :— As I was a-saying ‘ bout the mill : As I went in , the boys had stopped work and was a-gittin ’ down ther dinners , and Bills amongst ‘ em , and old Ezry a-chattin ’ away — great hand , he was , far his joke , and allus a-cuttin ’ up and a-gittin ’ off his odd-come-shorts on the boys . And that day he was in particular good humor . He 'd brought some liquor down far the boys , and he 'd be'n drinkin ’ a little hisse'f , enough to feel it . He did n't drink much — that is to say , he did n't git drunk adzactly ; but he tuck his dram , you understand . You see , they made ther own whisky in them days , and it was  n't nothin ’ like the bilin ’ stuff you git now . Old Ezry had a little still , and allus made his own whisky , enough far fambly use , and jist as puore as worter , and as harmless . But now-a-days the liquor you git 's rank pizen . They say they put tobacker in it , and strychnine , and the Lord knows what ; ner I never knowed why , ‘ less it was to give it a richer-lookin ’ flavor , like . Well , Ezry he ‘ d brought up a jug , and the boys had be'n ahYpppHeNtakin ’ it purty free ; I seed that as quick as I went in . And old Ezry called out to me to come and take some , the first thing . Told him I did  n't b'lieve I keered about it ; but nothin ’ would do but I must take a drink with the boys ; and I was tired anyhow and I thought a little would  n't hurt ; so I takes a swig ; and as I set the jug down Bills spoke up and says , “ You 're a stranger to me , and I 'm a stranger to you , but I reckon we can drink to our better acquaintance , ” er somepin ’ to that amount , and poured out another snifter in a gourd he 'd be'n ahYpppHeNdrinkin ’ coffee in , and handed it to me . Well , I could  n't well refuse , of course , so I says , “ Here ‘ s to us , ” and drunk her down — mighty nigh a half pint , I reckon . Now , I railly did  n't want it , but , as I tell you , I was obleeged to take it , and I downed her at a swaller and never batted an eye , far , to tell the fact about it , I liked the taste o ’ liquor ; and I do yit , only I know when I ’ got enough . Jist then I did n't want to drink on account o ’ Steve . Steve could n't abide liquor in no shape ner form — far medicine ner nothin ’ , and I ‘ ve allus thought it was his mother 's doin 's .</p>
     <p>Now , a few months afore this I ‘ d be'n to Vincennes , and I was jist a-tellin ’ Ezry what they was a-astin ’ far ther liquor there — far I ‘ d fetched a couple o ’ gallon home with me ‘ at I ‘ d paid six bits far , and pore liquor at that : And I was a-tellin ’ about it , and old Ezry was a-sayin ’ what an oudacious figger that was , and how he could make money a-sellin ’ it far half that price , and was a-goin ’ on a-braggin ’ about his liquor — and it was a good article — far new whisky ,— and jist then Steve comes in , jist as Bills was a-sayin ’ ‘ at a man ‘ at would n't drink that whisky was n't no man at all . So , of course , when they ast Steve to take some and he told ‘ em no , ‘ at he was much obleeged , Bills was kind o ’ tuck down , you understand , and had to say somepin ’ ; and says he , “ I reckon you ai n't no better ‘ n the rest of us , and we ‘ ve be'n ahYpppHeNdrinkin ’ of it . ” But Steve did  n't let on like he noticed Bills at all , and rech and shuck hands with the other boys and ast how they was all a-comin ’ on .</p>
     <p>I seed Bills was riled , and more ‘ n likely wanted trouble ; and shore enough , he went on to say , kind o ’ snarlin ’ like , ‘ at “ he 'd knowed o ’ men in his day ‘ at had be'n licked far refusin ’ to drink when their betters ast ‘ em ; ” and said furder ‘ at “ a lickin ’ was n't none too good far anybody ‘ at would refuse liquor like that o ’ Ezry 's , and in his own house too ” — er buildin ’ , ruther . Ezry shuck his head at him , but I seed ‘ at Bills was bound far a quarrel , and I winks at Steve , as much as to say , “ Do n't you let him bully you ; you 'll find your brother here to see you have fair play ! ” I was a-feelin ’ my oats some about then , and Steve seed I was , and looked so sorry like , and like his mother , ‘ at I jist thought , “ I kin fight far you , and die far you , ‘ cause you 're wuth it ! ” — And I did n't someway feel like it would amount to much ef I did die er git killed er somepin ’ on his account . I seed Steve was mighty white around the mouth and his eyes was a glitterin ’ like a snake 's ; but Bills did n't seem to take warnin ’ , but went on to say ‘ at he 'd knowed boys ‘ at loved the'r mothers so well they could n't drink nothin ’ stronger ‘ n milk .— And then you 'd ort o ’ seed Steve 's coat fly off , jist like it wanted to git out of his way , and give the boy room accordin ’ to his stren'th . I seed Bills grab a piece o ’ scantlin ’ jist in time to ketch his arm as he struck at Steve ,— far Steve was a-comin ’ far him dangerss . But they 'd ketched Steve from behind jist then ; and Bills turned far me . I seed him draw back , and I seed Steve a-scufflin ’ to ketch his arm ; but he did n't reach it quite in time to do me no good . It must a-come awful suddent . The first I ricollect was a roarin ’ and a buzzin ’ in my ears , and when I kind o ’ come a little better to , and crawled up and peeked over the saw-log I was a-layin ’ the other side of , I seed a couple clinched and a rollin ’ over and over , and a-makin ’ the chips and saw-dust fly , now I tell you ! Bills and Steve it was — head and tail , tooth and toenail , and a-bleedin ’ like good fellers . I seed a gash o ’ some kind in Bills 's head , and Steve was purty well tuckered , and a-pantin ’ like a lizard ; and I made a rush in , and one o ’ the Carter boys grabbed me and told me to jist keep cool ; ‘ at Steve did n't need no he'p , and they might need me to keep Bills 's friends off ef they made a rush . By this time Steve had whirlt Bills , and was a-jist a-gittin ’ in a fair way to finish him up in good style , when Wesley Morris run in — I seed him do it — run in , and afore we could ketch him he struck Steve a deadener in the butt o ’ the ear and knocked him as limber as a rag . And then Bills whirlt Steve and got him by the throat , and Ben Carter and me and old Ezry closed in — Carter tackled Morris , and Ezry and me grabs Bills — and as old Ezry grabbed him to pull him off , Bills kind o ’ give him a side swipe o ’ some kind and knocked him — I do n't know how far ! And jist then Carter and Morris come a-scufflin ’ back'ards right amongst us , and Carter throwed him right acrost Bills and Steve . Well , it ai n't fair , and I do n't like to tell it , but I seed it was the last chance and I tuck advantage of it :— As Wesley and Ben fell it pulled Bills down in a kind o ’ twist , do n't you understand , so 's he could n't he'p hisse'f , yit still a-clinchin ’ Steve by the throat , and him black in the face : Well , as they fell I grabbed up a little hick'ry limb , not bigger ‘ n my two thumbs , and I struck Bills a little tap kind o ’ over the back of his head like , and blame me ef he did n't keel over like a stuck pig — and not any too soon , nuther , far he had Steve 's chunk as nigh put out as you ever seed a man 's , to come to agin . But he was up th'reckly and ready to a-went at it ef Bills could a-come to the scratch ; but Mister Bills he was n't in no fix to try it over ! After a-waitin ’ awhile far him to come to , and him not a-comin ’ to , we concluded ‘ at we 'd better he'p him , maybe . And we worked with him , and washed him , and drenched him with whisky , but it ‘ peared like it was n't no use : He jist laid there with his eyes about half shet , and a-breathin ’ like a hoss when he 's bad sceart ; and I 'll be dad-limbed ef I do n't believe he 'd a-died on our hands ef it had n't a-happened old Doc Zions come a-ridin ’ past on his way home from the Murdock neighberhood , where they was a-havin ’ sich a time with the milk-sick . And he examined Bills , and had him laid on a plank and carried down to the house — ‘ bout a mild , I reckon , from the mill . Looked kind o ’ curous to see Steve a-heppin ’ pack the feller , after his nearly chokin ’ him to death . Oh , it was a bloody fight , I tell you ! W'y , ther was n't a man in the mill ‘ at did n't have a black eye er somepin ’ ; and old Ezry , where Bills hit him , had his nose broke , and was as bloody as a butcher . And you 'd ort a-seed the women-folks when our p'session come a-bringin ’ Bills in . I never seed anybody take on like Bills 's woman . It was distressin ’ ; it was , indeed .— Went into hysterics , she did ; and we thought far awhile she 'd gone plum crazy , far she cried so pitiful over him , and called him “ Charley ! Charley ! ” ‘ stid of his right name , and went on , clean out of her head , tel she finally jist fainted clean away .</p>
     <p>Far three weeks Bills laid betwixt life and death , and that woman set by him night and day , and tended him as patient as a ’ angel — and she was a ’ angel , too ; and he 'd a-never lived to bother nobody agin ef it had n't a-be'n far Annie , as he called her . Zions said ther was a ‘ brazure of the — some kind o ’ p'tubernce , and ef he 'd a-be'n struck jist a quarter of a ’ inch below — jist a quarter of a ’ inch — he 'd a-be'n a dead man . And I 've sence wished — not ‘ at I want the life of a human bein ’ to account far , on'y , well , no odds — I 've sence wished ‘ at I had a-hit him jist a quarter of a ’ inch below !</p>
     <p>Well , of course , them days ther was n't no law o ’ no account , and nothin ’ was ever done about it . So Steve and me got our grindin ’ , and talked the matter over with Ezry and the boys . Ezry said he was a-goin ’ to do all he could far Bills , ‘ cause he was a good hand , and when he was n't drinkin ’ ther was n't no peaceabler man in the settlement . I kind o ’ suspicioned what was up , but I said nothin ’ then . And Ezry said furder , as we was about drivin ’ off , that Bills was a despert feller , and it was best to kind o ’ humor him a little . “ And you must kind o ’ be on your guard , ” he says , “ and I 'll watch him and ef anything happens ‘ at I git wind of I 'll let you know , ” he says ; and so we put out far home .</p>
     <p>Mother tuck on awful about it . You see , she thought she 'd be'h the whole blame of it , ‘ cause the Sunday afore that her and Steve had went to meetin ’ , and they got there late , and the house was crowded , and Steve had ast Bills to give up his seat to Mother , and he would n't do it , and said somepin ’ ‘ at disturbed the prayin ’ , and the preacher prayed ‘ at the feller ‘ at was a-makin ’ the disturbance might be forgive ; and that riled Bills so he got up and left , and hung around till it broke up , so 's he could git a chance at Steve to pick a fight . And he did try it , and dared Steve and double-dared him far a fight , but Mother begged so hard ‘ at she kep ’ him out of it . Steve said ‘ at he 'd a-told me all about it on the way to Ezry 's , on'y he 'd promised Mother , you know , not to say nothin ’ to me .</p>
     <p>Ezry was over at our house about six weeks after the fight , appearantly as happy as you please . We ast him how him and Bills was a-makin ’ it , and he said firstrate ; said ‘ at Bills was jist a-doin ’ splendid ; said he 'd got moved in his new house ‘ at he 'd fixed up far him , and ever'thing was a-goin ’ on as smooth as could be ; and Bills and the boys was on better terms ‘ n ever ; and says he , “ As far as you and Steve ‘ s concerned , Bills do n't ‘ pear to bear you no ill feelin 's , and says as far as he ‘ s concerned the thing ‘ s settled . ” “ Well , ” says I , “ Ezry , I hope so ; but I can n't he'p but think ther ‘ s somepin ’ at the bottom of all this ; ” and says I , “ I do  n't think it 's in Bills to ever amount to anything good ; ” and says I , “ It 's my opinion ther ‘ s a dog in the well , and now you mark it ! ”</p>
     <p>Well , he said he was n't jist easy , but maybe he ‘ d come out all right ; said he could n't turn the feller off — he had n't the heart to do that , with that-air pore , dilicate woman o ’ his , and the baby . And then he went on to tell what a smart sort o ’ woman Bills 's wife was ,— one of the nicest little women he ‘ d ever laid eyes on , said she was ; said she was the kindest thing , and the sweetest-tempered , and all — and the handiest woman ‘ bout the house , and ‘ bout sewin ’ , and cookin ’ , and the like , and all kinds o ’ housework ; and so good to the childern , and all ; and how they all got along so well ; and how proud she was of her baby , and allus a-goin ’ on about it and a-cryin ’ over it and a-carryin ’ on , and would n't leave it out of her sight a minute . And Ezry said ‘ at she could write so purty , and made sich purty pictures far the childern ; and how they all liked her better'n ther own mother . And , sence she 'd moved , he said it seemed so lonesome like ‘ thout her about the house — like they 'd lost one o ’ ther own fambly ; said they did n't git to see her much now , on'y sometimes , when her man would be at work , she 'd run over far awhile , and kiss all the childern and women-folks about the place ,— the greatest hand far the childern , she was ; tell ‘ em all sorts o'little stories , you know , and sing far ‘ em ; said ‘ at she could sing so sweet-like ,' at time and time agin she 'd break clean down in some song o'nuther , and her voice would trimble so mournful-like ‘ at you 'd find yourse'f ahYpppHeNcryin ’ afore you knowed it . And she used to coax Ezry 's woman to let her take the childern home with her ; and they used to allus want to go , ‘ tel Bills come onc't while they was there , and they said he got to jawin ’ her far a-makin ’ some to-do over the baby , and swore at her and tuck it away from her and whipped it far cryin ’ , and she cried and told him to whip her and not little Annie , and he said that was jist what he was a-doin ’ . And the childern was allus afear 'd to go there any more after that — ‘ fear 'd he 'd come home and whip little Annie agin . Ezry said he jist done that to skeer ‘ em away — ‘ cause he did n't want a passel o ’ childern a-whoopin ’ and a-howlin ’ and a-trackin ’ ‘ round the house all the time .</p>
     <p>But , shore enough , Bills , after the fight , ‘ peared like he ‘ d settled down , and went ‘ bout his business so stiddy-like , and worked so well , the neighbors begin to think he was all right after all , and railly some got to likin ’ him . But far me , well , I was a leetle slow to argy ‘ at the feller was n't “ a-possumin ’ . ” But the next time I went over to the mill — and Steve went with me — old Ezry come and met us , and said ‘ at Bills did n't have no hard feelin 's ef we did n't , and ‘ at he wanted us to fergive him ; said ‘ at Bills wanted him to tell us ‘ at he was sorry the way he 'd acted , and wanted us to fergive him . Well , I looked at Ezry , and we both looked at him , jist perfectly tuck back — the idee o ’ Bills a-wantin ’ anybody to fergive him ! And says I , “ Ezry , what in the name o ’ common sense do you mean ? ” And says he , “ I mean jist what I say ; Bills jined meetin ’ last night and had ‘ em all a-prayin ’ far him ; and we all had a glorious time , ” says old Ezry ; “ and his woman was there and jined , too , and prayed and shouted and tuck on to beat all ; and Bills got up and spoke and give in his experience , and said he 'd be'n a bad man , but , glory to God , them times was past and gone ; said ‘ at he wanted all of ‘ em to pray far him , and he wanted to prove faithful , and wanted all his inemies to fergive him ; and prayed ‘ at you and Steve and your folks would fergive him , and ever'body ‘ at he ever wronged anyway . ” And old Ezry was a-goin ’ on , and his eyes a-sparklin ’ , and a-rubbin ’ his hands , he was so excited and tickled over it , ‘ at Steve and me we jist stood there a-gawkin ’ like , tel Bills hisse'f come up and rech out one hand to Steve and one to me ; and Steve shuck with him kind o ’ oneasy like , and I — well , sir , I never felt cur'oser in my born days than I did that minute . The cold chills crep ’ over me , and I shuck as ef I had the agur , and I folded my hands behind me and I looked that feller square in the eye , and I tried to speak three or four times afore I could make it , and when I did , my voice was n't natchurl — sounded like a feller a-whisperin ’ through a tin horn er somepin ’ .— and I says , says I , “ You 're a liar , ” slow and delibert . That was all . His eyes blazed a minute , and drapped ; and he turned , ‘ thout a word , and walked off . And Ezry says , “ He 's in airnest ; I know he 's in airnest , er he 'd a-never a-tuck that ! ” And so he went on , tel finally Steve jined in , and betwixt ‘ em they p'suaded me ‘ at I was in the wrong and the best thing to do was to make it all up , which I finally did . And Bills said ‘ at he 'd a-never a-felt jist right ‘ thout my friendship , far he 'd wronged me , he said , and he 'd wronged Steve and Mother , too , and he wanted a chance , he said , o ’ makin ’ things straight agin .</p>
     <p>Well , a-goin ’ home , I do n't think Steve and me talked o ’ nothin ’ else but Bills — how airnest the feller acted ‘ bout it , and how , ef he was n't in airnest he 'd a-never a-swallered that ‘ lie , ’ you see . That 's what walked my log , far he could a-jist as easy a-knocked me higher ‘ n Kilgore 's kite as he could to walk away ‘ thout a-doin ’ of it .</p>
     <p>Mother was awful tickled when she heerd about it , far she 'd had an idee ‘ at we 'd have trouble afore we got back , and a-gitten home safe , and a-bringin ’ the news ‘ bout Bills a-jinin ’ church and all , tickled her so ‘ at she mighty nigh shouted far joy . You see , Mother was a ’ old church-member all her life ; and I do n't think she ever missed a sermont er a prayer-meetin ’ ‘ at she could possibly git to — rain er shine , wet er dry . When ther was a meetin ’ of any kind a-goin ’ on , go she would , and nothin ’ short o ’ sickness in the fambly , er knowin ’ nothin ’ of it would stop her ! And clean up to her dyin ’ day she was a God-fearin ’ and consistent Christian ef ther ever was one . I mind now when she was tuck with her last spell and laid bedfast far eighteen months , she used to tell the preacher , when he ‘ d come to see her and pray and go on , ‘ at she could die happy ef she could on'y be with ‘ em all agin in their love-feasts and revivals . She was purty low then , and had be'n ahYpppHeNfailin ’ fast far a day er two ; and that day they 'd be'n ahYpppHeNholdin ’ service at the house . It was her request , you know , and the neighbers had congergated and was a-prayin ’ and a-singin ’ her favorite hymns — one in p'tickler , “ God moves in a mysterous way his wunders to p'form , ” and ‘ bout his “ Walkin ’ on the sea and a-ridin ’ of the storm . ” — Well , anyway , they 'd be'n ahYpppHeNsingin ’ that hymn far her — she used to sing that ‘ n so much , I ricollect as far back as I kin remember ; and I mind how it used to make me feel so lonesome-like and solemn , do n't you know ,— when I 'd be a-knockin ’ round the place along of evenin 's , and she 'd be a-milkin ’ , and I 'd hear her , at my feedin ’ , way off by myse'f , and it allus somehow made me feel like a feller 'd ort o ’ try and live as nigh right as the law allows , and that 's about my doctern yit . Well , as I was a-goin ’ on to say , they 'd jist finished that old hymn , and Granny Lowry was jist a-goin to lead in prayer , when I noticed mother kind o ’ tried to turn herse'f in bed , and smiled so weak and faint-like , and looked at me , with her lips a-kind o ’ movin ’ ; and I thought maybe she wanted another dos't of her syrup ‘ at Ezry 's woman had fixed up far her , and I kind o ’ stooped down over her and ast her if she wanted anything . “ Yes , ” she says , and nodded , and her voice sounded so low and solemn and so far away-like ‘ at I knowed she 'd never take no more medicine on this airth . And I tried to ast her what it was she wanted , but I could n't say nothin ’ ; my throat hurt me , and I felt the warm tears a-boolgin ’ up , and her kind old face a-glimmerin ’ a-way so pale-like afore my eyes , and still a-smilin ’ up so lovin ’ and forgivin ’ and so good ‘ at it made me think so far back in the past I seemed to be a little boy agin ; and seemed like her thin gray hair was brown , and a-shinin ’ in the sun as it used to do when she helt me on her shoulder in the open door , when Father was a-livin ’ and we used to go to meet him at the bars ; seemed like her face was young agin , and a-smilin ’ like it allus used to be , and her eyes as full o ’ hope and happiness as afore they ever looked on grief er ever shed a tear . And I thought of all the trouble they had saw on my account , and of all the lovin ’ words her lips had said , and of all the thousand things her pore old hands had done far me ‘ at I never even thanked her far ; and how I loved her better ‘ n all the world besides , and would be so lonesome ef she went away — Lord ! I can n't tell you what I did n't think and feel and see . And I knelt down by her , and she whispered then far Steven , and he come , and we kissed her — and she died — a smilin ’ like a child — jist like a child .</p>
     <p>Well — well ! ‘ Pears like I 'm allus a-runnin ’ into somepin ’ else . I wisht I could tell a story ‘ thout driftin ’ off in matters ‘ at hai n't no livin ’ thing to do with what I started out with . I try to keep from thinkin ’ of afflictions and the like , ‘ cause sich is bound to come to the best of us ; but a feller 's ricollection will bring ‘ em up , and I reckon it 'd ort ‘ o be er it would n't be ; and I 've thought , sometimes , it was done may be to kind o ’ admonish a feller , as the Good Book says , of how good a world ‘ d be ‘ thout no sorrow in it .</p>
     <p>Where was I ? Oh , yes , I ricollect ;— about Bills a-jinin ’ church . Well , sir , ther ’ was n't a better-actin ’ feller and more religious-like in all the neighberhood . Spoke in meetin 's , he did , and tuck a ’ active part in all religious doin 's , and , in fact , was jist as square a man , appearantly , as the preacher hisse'f . And about six er eight weeks after he 'd jined , they got up another revival , and things run high . Ther ’ was a big excitement , and ever'body was a'tendin ’ from far and near . Bills and Ezry got the mill-hands to go , and did n't talk o ’ nothin ’ but religion . People thought awhile ‘ at old Ezry ‘ d turn preacher , he got so interested ‘ bout church matters . He was easy excited ‘ bout anything ; and when he went into a thing it was in dead earnest , shore !— “ jist flew off the handle , ” as I heerd a comical feller git off onct . And him and Bills was up and at it ever ’ night — prayin ’ and shoutin ’ at the top o ’ the'r voice . Them railly did seem like good times — when ever'body jined together , and prayed and shouted ho-sanner , and danced around together , and hugged each other like they was so full o ’ glory they jist could n't he'p theirse'v ' s — that 's the reason I jined ; it looked so kind o ’ whole-souled-like and good , you understand . But la ! I did n't hold out on'y far a little while , and no wunder !</p>
     <p>Well , about them times Bills was tuck down with the agur ; first got to chillin ’ ever ’ - other-day , then ever ’ day , and harder and harder , tel sometimes he ‘ d be obleeged to stay away from meetin ’ on account of it . And one't I was at meetin ’ when he told about it , and how when he could n't be with ‘ em he allus prayed at home , and he said ‘ at he believed his prayers was answered , far onc't he 'd prayed far a new outpourin ’ of the Holy Sperit , and that very night ther ’ was three new jiners . And another time he said ‘ at he ‘ d prayed ‘ at Wesley Morris would jine , and lo and behold you ! he did jine , and the very night ‘ at he prayed he would .</p>
     <p>Well , the night I 'm a-speakin ’ of he 'd had a chill the day afore and could n't go that night , and was in bed when Ezry druv past far him ; said he 'd like to go , but had a high fever and could n't . And then Ezry 's woman ast him ef he was too sick to spare Annie ; and he said no , they could take her and the baby : and told her to fix his medicine so 's he could reach it ‘ thout gittin ’ out o ’ bed , and he 'd git along ‘ thout her . And so she tuck the baby and went along with Ezry and his folks .</p>
     <p>I was at meetin ’ that night and ricollect ‘ em comin ’ in . Annie got a seat jist behind me — Steve give her his'n and stood up ; and I ricollect a-astin ’ her how Bills was a-gittin ’ along with the agur ; and little Annie , the baby , kep ’ a-pullin ’ my hair and a-crowin ’ tel finally she went to sleep ; and Steve ast her mother to let him hold her — cutest little thing you ever laid eyes on , and the very pictur ’ of her mother .</p>
     <p>Old Daddy Barker preached that night , and a mighty good sermont . His text , ef I ricollect right , was “ workin ’ out your own salvation ; ” and when I listen to preachers nowadays in ther big churches and ther fine pulpits , I allus think o ’ Daddy Barker , and kind o ’ some way wisht the old times could come agin , with the old log meetin ’ - house with its puncheon floor and the chinkin ’ in the walls , and old Daddy Barker in the pulpit . He 'd make you feel ‘ at the Lord could make hissef at home there , and find jist as abundant comfort in the old log house as he could in any of your fine-furnished churches ‘ at you can n't set down in ‘ thout payin ’ far the privilege , like it was a theater .</p>
     <p>Ezry had his two little girls jine that night , and I ricollect the preacher made sich a purty prayer about the Savior a-cotin ’ from the Bible ‘ bout “ Suffer little childern to come unto me ” and all ; and talked so purty about the jedgment day , and mothers a-meetin ’ the'r little ones there and all ; and went on tel ther was n't a dry eye in the house — and jist as he was a-windin ’ up , Abe Riggers stuck his head in at the door and hollered “ fire ” loud as he could yell . We all rushed out , a-thinkin ’ it was the meetin ’ - house ; but he hollered it was the mill ; and shore enough , away off to the southards we could see the light acrost the woods , and see the blaze a-lickin ’ up above the trees . I seed old Ezry as he come a-scufflin ’ through the crowd ; and we put out together far it . Well , it was two mild to the mill , but by the time we 'd half way got there , we could tell it was n't the mill a-burnin ’ , ‘ at the fire was furder to the left , and that was Ezry 's house ; and by the time we got there it was n't much use . We pitched into the household goods , and got out the beddin ’ , and the furnitur ’ and cheers and the like o ’ that ; saved the clock and a bedstid , and got the bureau purt ’ nigh out when they hollered to us ‘ at the roof was a cavin ’ in , and we had to leave it ; well , we 'd tuck the drawers out , all but the big one , and that was locked ; and it and all in it went with the buildin ’ , and that was a big loss : All the money ‘ at Ezry was a-layin ’ by was in that-air drawer , and a lot o ’ keepsakes and trinkets ‘ at Ezry 's woman said she would n't a-parted with far the world and all .</p>
     <p>I never seed a troubleder fambly than they was . It jist ‘ peared like old Ezry give clean down , and the women and childern a-cryin ’ and a-takin ’ on . It looked jist awful — shore 's you 're born !— Losin ’ ever'thing they 'd worked so hard far — and there it was , purt ’ nigh midnight , and a fambly , jist a little while ago all so happy , and now with no home to go to ner nothin ’ !</p>
     <p>It was arranged far Ezry 's to move in with Bills — that was about the on'y chance — on'y one room and a loft ; but Bills said they could manage some way , far a while anyhow .</p>
     <p>Bills said he seed the fire when it first started , and could a-put it out ef he 'd on'y be'n strong enough to git there ; said he started twic't to go , but was too weak and had to go back to bed agin ; said it was a-blazin ’ in the kitchen roof when he first seed it . So the gineral conclusion ‘ at we all come to was — it must a-ketched from the flue .</p>
     <p>It was too late in the Fall then to think o ’ buildin ’ even the onryest kind o ’ shanty , and so Ezry moved in with Bills . And Bills used to say ef it had  n't a-be'n far Ezry he 'd a-never a-had no house , ner nuthin ’ to put in it , nuther . You see , all the household goods ‘ at Bills had in the world he 'd got of Ezry , and he ‘ lowed he 'd be a triflin ’ whelp ef he did n't do all in his power to make Ezry perfeckly at home ‘ s long as he wanted to stay there . And together they managed to make room far ‘ em all , by a-buildin ’ a kind o ’ shed-like to the main house , intendin ’ to build when Spring come . And ever'thing went along first-rate , I guess ; never heerd no complaints — that is , p'ticular .</p>
     <p>Ezry was kind o ’ down far a long time , though ; did n't like to talk about his trouble much , and did n't ‘ tend meetin ’ much , like he used to ; said it made him think ‘ bout his house burnin ’ , and he did n't feel safe to lose sight o ’ the mill . And the meetin 's kind o ’ broke up altogether that winter . Almost broke up religious doin 's , it did . ‘ S long as I 've lived here I never seed jist sich a slack in religion as ther ’ was that winter ; and ‘ fore then , I kin mind the time when ther ’ was n't a night the whole endurin ’ winter when they did n't have preachin ’ er prayer-meetin ’ o ’ some kind a-goin ’ on . W'y , I ricollect one night in p'ticular — the coldest night , whooh ! And somebody had stold the meetin ’ - house door , and they was obleeged to preach ‘ thout it . And the wind blowed in so they had to hold the'r hats afore the candles , and then one'thYpppHeNinhYpppHeNahYpppHeNwhile they 'd git sluffed out . And the snow drifted in so it was jist like settin ’ out doors ; and they had to stand up when they prayed — yessir ! stood up to pray . I noticed that night they was a ’ oncommon lot o ’ jiners , and I believe to this day ‘ at most of ‘ em jined jist to git up wher ’ the stove was . Lots o ’ folks had the'r feet froze right in meetin ’ ; and Steve come home with his ears froze like they was whittled out o ’ bone ; and he said ‘ at Mary Madaline Wells 's feet was froze , and she had two pair o ’ socks on over her shoes . Oh , it was cold , now I tell you !</p>
     <p>They run the mill part o ’ that winter — part they could n't . And they did n't work to say stiddy tel along in Aprile , and then ther ’ was snow on the ground yit — in the shadders — and the ground froze , so you could n't hardly dig a grave . But at last they got to kind o ’ jiggin ’ along agin . Plenty to do ther ’ was ; and old Ezry was mighty tickled , too ; ‘ peared to recruit right up like . Ezry was allus best tickled when things was a-stirrin ’ , and then he was a-gittin ’ ready far buildin ’ , you know , wanted a house of his own , he said — and of course it was n't adzackly like home , all cluttered up as they was there at Bills 's . They got along mighty well , though , together ; and the women-folks and childern got along the best in the world . Ezry 's woman used to say she never laid eyes on jist sich another woman as Annie was . Said it was jist as good as a winter 's schoolin ’ far the childern ; said her two little girls had learnt to read , and did n't know the'r ahYpppHeNb abs afore Annie learnt ‘ em ; well , the oldest one , Mary Patience , she did know her letters , I guess — fourteen year old , she was ; but Mandy , the youngest , had never seed inside a book afore that winter ; and the way she learnt was jist su'prisin ’ . She was puny-like and frail-lookin ’ allus , but ever'body ‘ lowed she was a heap smarter ‘ n Mary Patience , and she was ; and in my opinion she railly had more sense ‘ n all the rest o ’ the childern put together , ‘ bout books and cipherin ’ and arethmetic , and the like ; and John Wesley , the oldest of ‘ em , he got to teachin ’ at last , when he growed up ,— but , la ! he could n't write his own name so ‘ s you could read it . I allus thought ther was a good ‘ eal of old Ezry in John Wesley . Liked to romance ‘ round with the youngsters ‘ most too well .— Spiled him far teachin ’ , I allus thought ; far instance , ef a scholard said somepin ’ funny in school , John-Wes he 'd jist have to have his laugh out with the rest , and it was jist fun far the boys , you know , to go to school to him . Allus in far spellin ’ - matches and the like , and learnin ’ songs and sich . I ricollect he give a ’ exhibition onc't , one winter , and I 'll never fergit it , I reckon .</p>
     <p>The school-house would on'y hold ‘ bout forty , comfortable , and that night ther ’ was up'ards of a hunderd er more — jist crammed and jammed ! And the benches was piled back so 's to make room far the flatform they 'd built to make the'r speeches and dialogues on ; and fellers a-settin ’ up on them back seats , the'r heads was clean aginst the j'ist . It was a low ceilin ’ , anyhow , and o ’ course them ‘ at tuck a part in the doin 's was way up , too . Janey Thompson had to give up her part in a dialogue , ‘ cause she looked so tall she was afeard the congergation would laugh at her ; and they could n't git her to come out and sing in the openin ’ song ‘ thout lettin ’ her set down first and git ready ‘ fore they pulled the curtain . You see , they had sheets sewed together , and fixed on a string some way , to slide back'ards and for'ards , do n't you know . But they was a big bother to ‘ em — could n't git ‘ em to work like . Ever ’ time they 'd git ‘ em slid ‘ bout half way acrost , somepin ’ would ketch , and they 'd have to stop and fool with ‘ em awhile ‘ fore they could git ‘ em the balance o ’ the way acrost . Well , finally , t'ords the last , they jist kep ’ ‘ em drawed back all the time . It was a pore affair , and spiled purt nigh ever ’ piece ; but the scholards all wanted it fixed thataway , the teacher said , in a few appropert remarks he made when the thing was over . Well , I was a settin ’ in the back part o ’ the house on them high benches , and my head was jist even with them on the flatform , and the lights was pore , wher ’ the string was stretched far the curtain to slide on it looked like the p'formers was strung on it . And when Lige Boyer 's boy was a-speakin ’ — kind o ’ mumbled it , you know , and you could n't half hear — it looked far the world like he was a-chawin ’ on that-air string ; and some devilish feller ‘ lowed ef he 'd chaw it clean in two it 'd be a good thing far the balance . After that they all sung a sleigh-ridin ’ song , and it was right purty , the way they got it off . Had a passel o ’ sleigh-bells they 'd ring ever ’ onc'thYpppHeNinhYpppHeNahYpppHeNwhile , and it sounded purty — shore !</p>
     <p>Then Hunicut 's girl , Marindy , read a letter ‘ bout winter , and what fun the youngsters allus had in winter-time , a-sleighin ’ and the like , and spellin ’ - matches , and huskin ’ - bees , and all . Purty good , it was , and made a feller think o ’ old times . Well , that was about the best thing ther ’ was done that night ; but ever'body said the teacher wrote it far her ; and I would n't be su'prised much , far they was married not long afterwards . I expect he wrote it far her .— Would n't put it past Wes !</p>
     <p>They had a dialogue , too , ‘ at was purty good . Little Bob Arnold was all fixed up — had on his pap 's old bell-crowned hat , the one he was married in . Well , I jist thought die I would when I seed that old hat and called to mind the night his pap was married , and we all got him a little how-come-you-so on some left-handed cider ‘ at had be'n ahYpppHeNlayin ’ in a whisky-bar'l tel it was strong enough to bear up a ’ egg . I kin ricollect now jist how he looked in that hat , when it was all new , you know , and a-settin on the back of his head , and his hair in his eyes ; and sich hair !— as red as git-out — and his little black eyes a-shinin ’ like beads . Well sir , you 'd a-died to a-seed him a-dancin ’ . We danced all night that night , and would a-be'n ahYpppHeNdancin ’ yit , I reckon , ef the fiddler had n't a-give out . Wash Lowry was a-fiddlin ’ far us ; and along to'rds three or four in the mornin ’ Wash was purty well fagged out . You see , Wash could never play far a dance er nothin ’ ‘ thout a-drinkin ’ more er less , and when he got to a certain pitch you could n't git nothin ’ out o ’ him but “ Barbary Allan ; ” so at last he struck up on that , and jist kep ’ it up and kep ’ it up , and nobody could n't git nothin ’ else out of him !</p>
     <p>Now , anybody ‘ at ever danced knows ‘ at “ Barbary Allan ” hai n't no tune to dance by , no way you can fix it ; and , o ’ course , the boys seed at onc't the'r fun was gone ef they could  n't git him on another tune .— And they ‘ d coax and beg and plead with him , and maybe git him started on “ The Wind Blows over the Barley , ” and ‘ bout the time they 'd git to knockin ’ it down agin purty lively , he 'd go to sawin ’ away on “ Barbary Allan ” — and I'llhYpppHeNbehYpppHeNswitchedhYpppHeNtohYpppHeNdeath ef that feller did n't set there and play hisse'f sound asleep on “ Barbary Allan , ” and we had to wake him up afore he 'd quit ! Now , that 's jes ’ a plum ’ facts . And ther ’ was n't a better fiddler nowheres than Wash Lowry , when he was at hisse'f . I 've heerd a good many fiddlers in my day , and I never heerd one yit ‘ at could play my style o ’ fiddlin ’ ekal to Wash Lowry . You see , Wash did n't play none o ’ this-here newfangled music — nothin ’ but the old tunes , you understand , “ The Forkéd Deer , ” and “ Old Fat Gal , ” and “ Gray Eagle , ” and the like . Now , them 's music ! Used to like to hear Wash play “ Gray Eagle . ” He could come as nigh a-makin ’ that old tune talk as ever you heerd ! Used to think a heap o ’ his fiddle — and he had a good one , shore . I 've heard him say , time and time agin , ‘ at a five-dollar gold-piece would n't buy it , and I knowed him my-se'f to refuse a calf far it onc't — yessir , a yearland calf — and the feller offered him a double-bar'l ' d pistol to boot , and blame ef he 'd take it ; said he 'd ruther part with anything else he owned than his fiddle .— But here I am , clean out o ’ the furry agin . Oh , yes ; I was a-tellin ’ about little Bob , with that old hat ; and he had on a swaller-tail coat and a lot o ’ fixin 's , a-actin ’ like he was ‘ squire ; and he had him a great long beard made out o ’ corn-silks , and you would n't a-knowed him ef it was n't far his voice . Well , he was a-p'tendin ’ he was a ‘ squire a-tryin ’ some kind o ’ law-suit , you see ; and John Wesley he was the defendunt , and Joney Wiles , I believe it was , played like he was the plaintive . And they 'd had a fallin ’ out ‘ bout some land , and was a-lawin ’ far p'session , you understand . Well , Bob he made out it was a mighty bad case when John-Wes comes to consult him about it , and tells him ef a little p'int o ’ law was left out he thought he could git the land far him . And then John-Wes bribes him , you understand , to leave out the p'int o ’ law , and the ‘ squire says he 'll do all he kin , and so John-Wes goes out a feelin ’ purty good . Then Wiles comes in to consult the ‘ squire do n't you see . And the ‘ squire tells him the same tale he told John Wesley . So Wiles bribes him to leave out the p'int o ’ law in his favor , do n't you know . So when the case is tried he decides in favor o ’ John-Wes , a-tellin ’ Wiles some cock-and-bull story ‘ bout havin ’ to manage it thataway so ‘ s to git the case mixed so 's he could git it far him shore ; and posts him to sue far change of venue er somepin ’ ,— anyway , Wiles gits a new trial , and then the ‘ squire decides in his favor , and tells John-Wes another trial will fix it in his favor , and so on .— And so it goes on tel , anyway , he gits holt o ’ the land hisse'f and all ther money besides , and leaves them to hold the bag ! Wellsir , it was purty well got up ; and they said it was John-Wes 's doin 's , and I ‘ low it was — he was a good hand at anything o ’ that sort , and knowed how to make fun .— But I 've be'n a tellin ’ you purty much ever'thing but what I started out with , and I 'll try and hurry through , ‘ cause I know you 're tired .</p>
     <p>‘ Long ‘ bout the beginin ’ o ’ summer , things had got back to purty much the old way . The boys round was a-gittin ’ devilish , and o ’ nights ‘ specially ther ’ was a sight o ’ meanness a-goin ’ on . The mill-hands , most of'em , was mixed up in it — Coke and Morris , and them ‘ at had jined meetin ’ ‘ long in the winter , had all backslid , and was a-drinkin ’ and carousin ’ ‘ round worse ‘ n ever .</p>
     <p>People perdicted ‘ at Bills would backslide , but he helt on faithful , to all appearance ; said he liked to see a feller when he made up his mind to do right , he liked to see him do it , and not go back on his word ; and even went so far as to tell Ezry ef they did n't put a stop to it he 'd quit the neighberhood and go some'rs else . And Bills was Ezry 's head man then , and he could n't a-got along ‘ thout him ; and I b'lieve ef Bills had a-said the word old Ezry would a-turned off ever ’ hand he had . He got so he jist left ever'thing to Bills . Ben Carter was turned off far somepin ’ , and nobody ever knowed what . Bills and him had never got along jist right sence the fight .</p>
     <p>Ben was with this set I was a-tellin ’ you ‘ bout , and they 'd got him to drinkin ’ and in trouble , o ’ course . I 'd knowed Ben well enough to know he would n't do nothin ’ onry ef he was n't agged on , and ef he ever was mixed up in anything o ’ the kind Wes Morris and John Coke was at the bottom of it , and I take notice they was n't turned off when Ben was .</p>
     <p>One night the crowd was out , and Ben amongst ‘ em , o ’ course .— Sence he 'd be'n turned off he 'd be'n ahYpppHeNdrinkin ’ ,— and I never blamed him much ; he was so good-hearted like and easy led off , and I allus b'lieved it was n't his own doin 's .</p>
     <p>Well , this night they cut up awful , and ef ther was one fight ther was a dozend ; and when all the devilment was done they could do , they started on a stealin ’ expedition , and stold a lot o ’ chickens and tuck ‘ em to the mill to roast'em ; and , to make a long story short , that night the mill burnt clean to the ground . And the whole pack of ‘ em cologued together aginst Carter to saddle it onto him ; claimed ‘ at they left Ben there at the mill ‘ bout twelve o'clock — which was a fact , far he was dead drunk and could n't git away . Steve stumbled over him while the mill was a-burnin ’ and drug him out afore he knowed what was a-goin ’ on , and it was all plain enough to Steve ‘ at Ben did n't have no hand in the firm ’ of it . But I 'll tell you he sobered up mighty suddent when he seed what was a-goin ’ on , and heerd the neighbors a-hollerin ’ , and a-threatenin ’ , and a-goin ’ on !— far it seemed to be the ginerl idee ‘ at the buildin ’ was fired a-purpose . And says Ben to Steve , says he , “ I expect I 'll have to say good-bye to you , far they 've got me in a ticklish place ! I kin see through it all now , when it 's too late ! ” And jist then Wesley Morris hollers out , “ Where 's Ben Carter ? ” and started to'rds where me and Ben and Steve was a-standin ’ ; and Ben says , wild like , “ Do n't you two fellers ever think it was my doin 's , ” and whispers “ Good-bye , ” and started off , and when we turned , Wesley Morris was a-layin ’ flat of his back , and we heerd Carter yell to the crowd ‘ at “ that man ” — meanin ’ Morris — ” needed lookin ’ after worse than he did , ” and another minute he plunged into the river and swum acrost ; and we all stood and watched him in the flickerin ’ light tel he clum out on t'other bank ; and ‘ at was last anybody ever seed o ’ Ben Carter !</p>
     <p>It must a-be'n about three o'clock in the mornin ’ by this time , and the mill then was jist a-smoulderin ’ to ashes — far it was as dry as tinder and burnt like a flash — and jist as a party was a-talkin ’ o ’ organizin ’ and follerin ’ Carter , we heerd a yell ‘ at I 'll never fergit ef I 'd live tel another flood . Old Ezry , it was , as white as a corpse , and with the blood a-streamin ’ out of a gash in his forehead , and his clothes half on , come a-rushin ’ into the crowd and a-hollerin ’ fire and murder ever ’ jump . “ My house is a-burnin ’ , and my folks is all a-bein ’ murdered while you ‘ re a-standin ’ here ! And Bills done it ! Bills done it ! ” he hollered , as he headed the crowd and started back far home . “ Bills done it ! I caught him at it ; and he would a-murdered me in cold blood ef it had  n't a-be'n far his woman . He knocked me down , and had me tied to a bed-post in the kitchen afore I come to . And his woman cut me loose and told me to run far he'p ; and says I , ‘ Where 's Bills ? ’ and she says , ‘ He 's after me by this time . ’ And jist then we heerd Bills holler , and we looked , and he was a-standin ’ out in the clearin ’ in front o ’ the house , with little Annie in his arms ; and he hollered would n't she like to kiss the baby good-bye . ”</p>
     <p>“ And she hollered My God ! far me to save little Annie , and fainted clean dead away . And I heerd the roof a-crackin ’ , and grabbed her up and packed her out jist in time . And when I looked up , Bills hollered out agin , and says , ‘ Ezry , ’ he says , ‘ You kin begin to kind a ’ git an idee o ’ what a good feller I am ! And ef you had n't a-caught me you ‘ d a-never a-knowed it , and ‘ Brother Williams ’ would n't a-be'n called away to another app'intment like he is . ’ And says he , ‘ Now , ef you foller me I 'll finish you shore !— You 're safe now , far I hai n't got time to waste on you furder . ’ And jist then his woman kind o ’ come to her senses agin and hollered far little Annie , and the child heerd her and helt out its little arms to go to her , and hollered ‘ Mother ! Mother ! ’ And Bills says , Dam your mother ! ef it had n't a-be'n far her I 'd a-be'n all right . And dam you too ! ’ he says to me ,— ‘ This 'll pay you far that lick you struck me ; and far you a-startin ’ reports when I first come ‘ at more ‘ n likely I 'd done somepin ’ mean over east and come out west to reform ! And I wonder ef I did n't do somepin ’ mean afore I come here ? ’ he went on ; ‘ kill somebody er somepin ’ ? And I wonder ef I ai n't reformed enough to go back ? Good-bye , Annie ! ’ he hollered ; ‘ and you need n't fret about your baby , I ‘ ll be the same indulgent father to it I ‘ ve allus be'n ! ’ And the baby was a-cryin ’ and a-reachin ’ out its little arms to'rds its mother , when Bills he turned and struck oft ’ in the dark to'rds the river . ”</p>
     <p>This was about the tale ‘ at Ezry told us , as nigh as I can ricollect , and by the time he finished , I never want to see jist sich another crowd o ’ men as was a-swarmin ’ there . Ai n't it awful when sich a crowd gits together ? I tell you it makes my flesh creep to think about it !</p>
     <p>As Bills had gone in the direction of the river , we was n't long in makin ’ our minds up ‘ at he 'd have to cross it , and ef he done that he 'd have to use the boat ‘ at was down below the mill , er wade it at the ford , a mild er more down . So we divided in three sections , like — one to go and look after the folks at the house , and another to the boat , and another to the ford . And Steve and me and Ezry was in the crowd ‘ at struck far the boat , and we made time a-gittin ’ there ! It was awful dark , and the sky was a-cloudin'up like a storm ; but we was n't long a-gittin ’ to the p'int where the boat was allus tied ; but ther ’ was n't no boat there ! Steve kind o ’ tuck the lead , and we all talked in whispers . And Steve said to kind o ’ lay low and maybe we could hear somepin ’ , and some feller said he thought he heerd somepin ’ strange like , but the wind was kind o ’ raisin ’ and kep ’ up sich a moanin ’ through the trees along the bank ‘ t we could n't make out nothin ’ . “ Listen ! ” says Steve , suddent like , “ I hear somepin ! ” We was all still again — and we all heerd a moanin ’ ‘ at was sadder ‘ n the wind — sounded mournfuller to me ‘ cause I knowed it in a minute , and I whispered , “ Little Annie . ” And ‘ way out acrost the river we could hear the little thing a-sobbin ’ , and we all was still ‘ s death ; and we heerd a voice we knowd was Bills 's say , “ Dam ye ! Keep still , or I 'll drownd ye ! ” And the wind kind o ’ moaned agin and we could hear the trees a-screechin ’ together in the dark , and the leaves a-rustlin ’ ; and when it kind o ’ lulled agin , we heerd Bills make a kind o ’ splash with the oars ; and jist then Steve whispered far to lay low and be ready — he was a-goin ’ to riconnitre ; and he tuck his coat and shoes off , and slid over the bank and down into the worter as slick as a ’ eel . Then ever'thing was still agin , ‘ cept the moanin ’ o ’ the child , which kep ’ a-gittin ’ louder and louder ; and then a voice whispered to us , “ He 's a-comin ’ back ; the crowd below has sent scouts up , and they 're on t ’ other side . Now watch clos't , and he 's our meat . ” We could hear Bills , by the moanin ’ o ’ the baby , a-comin ’ nearder and nearder , tel suddently he made a sort o ’ miss-lick with the oar , I reckon , and must a splashed the baby , far she set up a loud cryin ; and jist then old Ezry , who was a-leanin ’ over the bank , kind o ’ lost his grip some way o ’ nuther , and fell kersplash in the worter like a ’ old chunk . “ Hello ! ” says Bills , through the dark , “ you 're there , too , air ye ? ” as old Ezry splashed up the bank agin . And “ Cuss you ! ” he says then , to the baby — “ ef it had n't be'n far your infernal squawkin ’ I 'd a-be'n all right ; but you 've brought the whole neighberhood out , and , dam you , I 'll jist let you swim out to ‘ em ! ” And we heerd a splash , then a kind o ’ gurglin ’ , and then Steve 's voice a-hollerin ’ , “ Close in on him , boys ; I 've got the baby ! ” And about a dozend of us bobbed off the bank like so many bull-frogs , and I 'll tell you the worter b'iled ! We could jist make out the shape o ’ the boat , and Bills a-standin ’ with a ’ oar drawed back to smash the first head ‘ at come in range . It was a mean place to git at him . We knowed he was despert , and far a minute we kind o ’ helt back . Fifteen foot o ’ worter ‘ s a mighty onhandy place to git hit over the head in ! And Bills says , “ You hai n't afeard , I reckon — twenty men agin one ! ” “ You 'd better give your se'f up ! ” hollered Ezry from the shore . “ No , Brother Sturgiss , ” says Bills , “ I can n't say ‘ at I 'm at all anxious ‘ bout bein ’ borned agin , jist yit awhile , ” he says ; “ I see you kind o ’ ‘ pear to go in far babtism ; guess you 'd better go home and git some dry clothes on ; and , speakin ’ o ’ home , you 'd ort ‘ o be there by all means — your house might catch afire and burn up while you 're gone ! ” And jist then the boat give a suddent shove under him — some feller 'd div under and tilted it — and far a minute it throwed him off his guard and the boys closed in . Still he had the advantage , bein ’ in the boat , and as fast as a feller would climb in he 'd git a whack o ’ the oar , tel finally they got to pilin ’ in a little too fast far him to manage , and he hollered then ‘ at we 'd have to come to the bottom ef we got him , and with that he div out o ’ the end o ’ the boat , and we lost sight of him ; and I 'll be blame ef he did n't give us the slip after all .</p>
     <p>Wellsir , we watched far him , and some o ’ the boys swum on down stream , expectin ’ he 'd raise , but could n't find hide ner hair of him ; so we left the boat a-driftin ’ off down stream and swum ashore , a-thinkin ’ he 'd jist drownded hisse'f ahYpppHeNpurpose . But ther ’ was more su'prise waitin ’ far us yit ,— for lo-and-behold-you , when we got ashore ther ’ was n't no trace o ’ Steve er the baby to be found . Ezry said he seed Steve when he fetched little Annie ashore , and she was all right on'y she was purt nigh past cryin ’ ; and he said Steve had lapped his coat around her and give her to him to take charge of , and he got so excited over the fight he laid her down betwixt a couple o ’ logs and kind o ’ forget about her tel the thing was over , and he went to look far her , and she was gone . Could n't a-be'n ‘ at she 'd a-wundered off her-own-se'f ; and it could n't a-be'n ‘ at Steve 'd take her , ‘ thout a-lettin us know it . It was a mighty aggervatin ’ conclusion to come to , but we had to do it , and that was , Bills must a got ashore unbeknownst to us and packed her off . Sich a thing was n't hardly probable , yit it was a thing ‘ at might be ; and after a-talkin ’ it over we had to admit ‘ at it must a-be'n the way of it . But where was Steve ? W'y , we argied , he 'd discivvered she was gone , and had put out on track of her ‘ thout losin ’ time to stop and explain the thing . The next question was , what did Bills want with her agin ? He 'd tried to drownd her onc't . We could ast questions enough , but c'rect answers was mighty skearce , and we jist concluded ‘ at the best thing to do was to put out far the ford , far that was the nighdest place Bills could cross ‘ thout a boat , and ef it was him tuck the child he was still on our side o ’ the river , o ’ course . So we struck out far the ford , a-leav-in ’ a couple o ’ men to search up the river . A drizzlin ’ sort o ’ rain had set in by this time , and with that and the darkness and the moanin ’ of the wind , it made ‘ bout as lonesome a prospect as a feller ever wants to go through agin .</p>
     <p>It was jist a-gittin ’ a little gray-like in the mornin ’ by the time we reached the ford , but you could n't hardly see two rods afore you far the mist and the fog ‘ at had settled along the river . We looked far tracks , but could n't make out nuthin ’ . Thereckly old Ezry punched me and p'inted out acrost the river . “ What 's that ? ” he whispers . Jist ‘ bout half way acrost was somepin ’ white-like in the worter — could n't make out what — perfeckly still it was . And I whispered back and told him I guess it was n't nothin ’ but a sycamore snag . “ Listen ! ” says he ; “ Sycamore snags do n't make no noise like that ! ” And , shore enough , it was the same moanin ’ noise we 'd heerd the baby makin ’ when we first got on the track . Sobbin ’ she was , as though nigh about dead . “ Well , ef that 's Bills , ” says I — “ and I reckon ther ’ hai n't no doubt but it is — what in the name o ’ all that 's good and bad 's the feller a-standin ’ there far ? ” And a-creep-in ’ clos'ter , we could make him out plainer and plainer . It was him ; and there he stood breast-high in the worter , a-holdin ’ the baby on his shoulder like , and a lookin ’ up stream , and a-waitin ’ .</p>
     <p>“ What do you make out of it ? ” says Ezry . “ What 's he waitin ’ far ? ”</p>
     <p>And a strainin ’ my eyes in the direction he was a-lookin ’ I seed somepin ’ a-movin ’ down the river , and a minute later I 'd made out the old boat a-driftin ’ down stream ; and then of course ever'thing was plain enough : He was waitin ’ far the boat , and ef he got that he 'd have the same advantage on us he had afore .</p>
     <p>“ Boys , ” says I , “ he must n't git that boat agin ! Foller me , and do n't let him git to the shore alive . ” And in we plunged . He seed us , but he never budged , on'y to grab the baby by its little legs , and swing it out at arms-len'th . “ Stop , there , ” he hollered . “ Stop jist where you air ! Move another inch and I 'll drownd this dam young-un afore your eyes ! ” he says .— And he ‘ d a done it . “ Boys , ” says I , “ he 's got us . Do n't move ! This thing 'll have to rest with a higher power ‘ n our ‘ n ! Ef any of you kin pray , ” says I , “ now 's a good time to do it ! ”</p>
     <p>Jist then the boat swung up , and Bills grabbed it and rech ‘ round and set the baby in it , never a-takin ’ his eye off o ’ us , though , far a minute . “ Now , ” says he , with a sort o ’ snarlin ’ laugh , “ I 've on'y got a little while to stay with you , and I want to say a few words afore I go . I want to tell you fellers , in the first place , ‘ at you 've be'n fooled in me : I hai n't a good feller , now , honest ! And ef you 're a little the worse far findin ’ it out so late in the day , you hai n't none the worse far losin ’ me so soon — far I 'm a-goin ’ away now , and any interference with my arrangements ‘ ll on'y give you more trouble ; so it 's better all around to let me go peaceable and jist while I 'm in the notion . I expect it 'll be a disapp'intment to some o ’ you that my name hai n't ‘ Williams , ’ but it hai n't . And maybe you wo n't think nigh as much o ’ me when I tell you furder ‘ at I was obleeged to ‘ dopt the name o ’ ‘ Williams ’ onc't to keep from bein ’ strung up to a lamp-post , but sich is the facts . I was so extremely unfortunit onc't as to kill a p'ticular friend o ’ mine , and he forgive me with his dyin ’ breath , and told me to run while I could , and be a better man . But he 'd spotted me with a ’ ugly mark ‘ at made it kind o ’ onhandy to git away , but I did at last ; and jist as I was a-gittin ’ reformed-like , you fellers had to kick in the traces , and I 've made up my mind to hunt out a more moraler community , where they do n't make sich a fuss about trifles . And havin ’ nothin ’ more to say , on'y to send Annie word ‘ at I 'll still be a father to her youngun here , I 'll bid you all good-bye . ” And with that he turned and clum in the boat — or ruther fell in ,— far somepin ’ black-like had riz up in it , with a ’ awful lick — my — God !— and , a minute later , boat and baggage was a-gratin ’ on the shore , and a crowd come thrashin ’ ‘ crost from tother side to jine us , and ‘ peared like was n't a second longer tel a feller was a-swingin ’ by his neck to the limb of a scrub-oak , his feet clean off the ground , and his legs a-jerkin ’ up and down like a limber-jack 's .</p>
     <p>And Steve it was a-layin ’ in the boat , and he 'd rid a mild or more ‘ thout knowin ’ of it . Bills had struck and stunt him as he clum in while the rumpus was a-goin ’ on , and he 'd on'y come to in time to hear Bills 's farewell address to us there at the ford .</p>
     <p>Steve tuck charge o ’ little Annie agin , and ef she 'd a-be'n his own child he would n't a-went on more over her than he did ; and said nobody but her mother would git her out o ’ his hands agin . And he was as good as his word ; and ef you could a-seed him a half hour after that , when he did give her to her mother — all lapped up in his coat and as drippin ’ - wet as a little drownded angel — it would a-made you wish't you was him to see that little woman a caperin ’ round him , and a-thankin ’ him , and a-cryin ’ and a-laughin ’ , and almost a-huggin ’ him , she was so tickled ,— Well , I thought in my soul she 'd die ! And Steve blushed like a girl to see her a-taking ’ on , and a-thankin ’ him , and a-cryin ’ , and a-kissin ’ little Annie , and a-goin ’ on . And when she inquired ‘ bout Bills , which she did all suddent like , with a burst o ’ tears , we jist did n't have the heart to tell her — on'y we said he 'd crossed the river and got away . And he had !</p>
     <p>And now comes a part o ’ this thing ‘ at ‘ ll more ‘ n like tax you to believe it : Williams and her was n't man and wife — and you need n't look su'prised , nuther , and I 'll tell you far why — They was own brother and sister ; and that brings me to her part of the story , which you 'll have to admit beats anything ‘ at you ever read about in books .</p>
     <p>Her and Williams — that was n't his name , like he acknowledged , hisse'f , you ricollect — ner she did n't want to tell his right name ; and we forgive her far that . Her and ‘ Williams ’ was own brother and sister , and the'r parents lived in Ohio some'ers . The'r mother had be'n dead five year ’ and better — grieved to death over her onnachurl brother 's recklessness , which Annie hinted had broke her father up in some way , in tryin ’ to shield him from the law . And the secret of her bein ’ with him was this : She had married a man o ’ the name of Curtis or Custer , I do n't mind which , adzackly — but no matter ; she 'd married a well-to-do young feller ‘ at her brother helt a ’ old grudge agin , she never knowed what ; and sence her marriage her brother had went on from bad to worse tel finally her father jist give him up and told him to go it his own way — he 'd killed his mother and ruined him , and he 'd jist give up all hopes . But Annie — you know how a sister is — she still clung to him and done ever'thing far him , tel finally , one night about three years after she was married she got word some way that he was in trouble agin , and sent her husband to he'p him ; and a half hour after he 'd gone , her brother come in , all excited and bloody , and told her to git the baby and come with him , ‘ at her husband had got in a quarrel with a friend o ’ his and was bad hurt . And she went with him , of course , and he tuck her in a buggy , and lit out with her as tight as he could go all night ; and then told her ‘ at he was the feller ‘ at had quarreled with her husband , and the officers was after him and he was obleeged to leave the country , and far fear he had n't made shore work o ’ him , he was a-takin ’ her along to make shore of his gittin ’ his revenge ; and he swore he 'd kill her and the baby too ef she dared to whimper . And so it was , through a hunderd hardships he 'd made his way at last to our section o ’ the country , givin ’ out ‘ at they was man and wife , and keepin ’ her from denyin ’ of it by threats , and promises of the time a-comin ’ when he 'd send her home to her man agin in case he had n't killed him . And so it run on tel you 'd a-cried to hear her tell it , and still see her sister 's love far the feller a-breakin ’ out by a-declarin ’ how kind he was to her at times , and how he was n't railly bad at heart , on'y far his ungov'nable temper . But I could n't he'p but notice , when she was a tellin ’ of her hist'ry , what a quiet sort o ’ look o ’ satisfaction settled on the face o ’ Steve and the rest of ‘ em , do n't you understand .</p>
     <p>And now ther ’ was on'y one thing she wanted to ast , she said ; and that was , could she still make her home with us tel she could git word to her friends ?— and there she broke down agin , not knowin ’ , of course , whether they was dead er alive ; far time and time agin she said somepin ’ told her she 'd never see her husband agin on this airth ; and then the women-folks would cry with her and console her , and the boys would speak hopeful — all but Steve ; some way o ’ nuther Steve was never like hisse'f from that time on .</p>
     <p>And so things went far a month and better . Ever'thing had quieted down , and Ezry and a lot o ’ hands , and me and Steve amongst ‘ em , was a-workin ’ on the frame-work of another mill . It was purty weather , and we was all in good sperits , and it ‘ peared like the whole neighberhood was interested — and they - was , too — women-folks and ever'body . And that day Ezry 's woman and amongst ‘ em was a-gittin ’ up a big dinner to fetch down to us from the house ; and along about noon a spruce-lookin ’ young feller , with a pale face and a black beard , like , come a-ridin ’ by and hitched his hoss , and comin ’ into the crowd , said “ Howdy , ” pleasant like , and we all stopped work as he went on to say ‘ at he was on the track of a feller o ’ the name o ’ ‘ Williams , ’ and wanted to know ef we could give him any infermation ‘ bout sich a man . Told him maybe ,— ‘ at a feller bearin ’ that name desappeared kind o ’ myster'ous from our neighberhood ‘ bout five weeks afore that . “ My God ! ” says he , a-turnin ’ paler'n ever , “ am I too late ? Where did he go , and was his sister and her baby with him ? ” Jist then I ketched sight o ’ the women-folks a-comin ’ with the baskets , and Annie with ‘ em , with a jug o ’ worter in her hand ; so I spoke up quick to the stranger , and says I , “ I guess ‘ his sister and baby ’ was n't along , ” says I , “ but his wife and baby 's some'eres here in the neighberhood yit . ” And then a-watchin ’ him clos't , I says , suddent , a-pin'tin ’ over his shoulder , “ There his woman is now — that one with the jug , there . ” Well , Annie had jist stooped to lift up one o ’ the little girls , when the feller turned , and the'r eyes met , “ Annie ! My wife ! ” he says ; and Annie she kind o ’ give a little yelp like and come a-flutterin ’ down in his arms ; and the jug o ’ worter rolled clean acrost the road , and turned a somerset and knocked the cob out of its mouth and jist laid back and hollered “ Good — good — good — good — good ! ” like as ef it knowed what was up and was jist as glad and tickled as the rest of us .</p>

      <head>AN OLD SWEETHEART .</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">As one who cons at evening o'er an album all alone ,</l>
       <l n="2">And muses on the faces of the friends that he has known ,</l>
       <l n="3">So I turn the leaves of fancy till , in shadowy design ,</l>
       <l n="4">I find the smiling features of an old sweetheart of mine .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="5">The lamplight seems to glimmer with a flicker of surprise ,</l>
       <l n="6">As I turn it low to rest me of the dazzle in my eyes ,</l>
       <l n="7">And light my pipe in silence , save a sigh that seems to yoke</l>
       <l n="8">Its fate with my tobacco and to vanish with the smoke .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="9">‘ Tis a fragrant retrospection — for the loving thoughts that start</l>
       <l n="10">Into being are like perfumes from the blossom of the heart ;</l>
       <l n="11">And to dream the old dreams over is a luxury divine —</l>
       <l n="12">When my truant fancy wanders with that old sweeheart of mine .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="13">Though I hear , beneath my study , like a fluttering of wings ,</l>
       <l n="14">The voices of my children , and the mother as she sings ,</l>
       <l n="15">I feel no twinge of conscience to deny me any theme</l>
       <l n="16">When care has cast her anchor in the harbor of a dream</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="17">In fact , to speak in earnest , I believe it adds a charm</l>
       <l n="18">To spice the good a trifle with a little dust of harm —</l>
       <l n="19">For I find an extra flavor in Memory 's mellow wine</l>
       <l n="20">That makes me drink the deeper to that old sweetheart of mine .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="21">A face of lily-beauty , with a form of airy grace ,</l>
       <l n="22">Floats out of my tobacco as the genii from the vase ;</l>
       <l n="23">And I thrill beneath the glances of a pair of azure eyes</l>
       <l n="24">As glowing as the summer and as tender as the skies .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="25">I can see the pink sunbonnet and the little checkered dress</l>
       <l n="26">She wore when first I kissed her and she answered the caress</l>

     <p>A WILD IRISHMAN .</p>
     <p>Not very many years ago the writer was for some months stationed at South Bend , a thriving little city of northern Indiana , its main population on the one side of the St. Joseph river , but quite a respectable fraction thereof taking its industrial way to the opposite shore , and there gaining an audience and a hearing in the rather imposing growth and hurly-burly of its big manufactories , and the consequent rapid appearance of multitudinous neat cottages , tenement houses and business blocks . A stranger , entering South Bend proper on any ordinary day , will be at some loss to account for its prosperous appearance — its flagged and bowldered streets — its handsome mercantile blocks , banks , and business houses generally . Reasoning from cause to effect , and seeing but a meager sprinkling of people on the streets throughout the day , and these seeming , for the most part , merely idlers , and in no wise accessory to the evident thrift and opulence of their surroundings , the observant stranger will be puzzled at the situation . But when evening comes , and the outlying foundries , sewing-machine , wagon , plow , and other “ works , ” together with the paper-mills and all the nameless industries — when the operations of all these are suspended for the day , and the workmen and workwomen loosed from labor — then , as this vast army suddenly invades and overflows bridge , roadway , street and lane , the startled stranger will fully comprehend the why and wherefore of the city 's high prosperity . And , once acquainted with the people there , the fortunate sojourner will find no ordinary culture and intelligence , and , as certainly , he will meet with a social spirit and a wholesouled heartiness that will make the place a lasting memory . The town , too , is the home of many world-known notables , and a host of local celebrities , the chief of which latter class I found , during my stay there , in the person of Tommy Stafford , or “ The Wild Irishman ” as everybody called him .</p>
     <p>“ Talk of odd fellows and eccentric characters , ” said Major Blowney , my employer , one afternoon , “ you must see our ‘ Wild Irishman ’ here before you say you 've yet found the queerest , brightest , cleverest chap in all your travels . What d'ye say , Stockford ? ” And the Major paused in his work of charging cartridges for his new breech-loading shotgun and turned to await his partner 's response .</p>
     <p>Stockford , thus addressed , paused above the shield-sign he was lettering , slowly smiling as he dipped and trailed his pencil through the ivory black upon a bit of broken glass and said , in his deliberate , half-absent-minded way ,— “ Is it Tommy you 're telling him about ? ” and then , with a gradual broadening of the smile , he went on , “ Well , I should say so . Tommy ! What 's come of the fellow , anyway ? I have n't seen him since his last bout with the mayor , on his trial for shakin ’ up that fast-horse man . ”</p>
     <p>“ The fast-horse man got just exactly what he needed , too , ” said the genial Major , laughing , and mopping his perspiring brow . “ The fellow was barkin ’ up the wrong stump when he tackled Tommy ! Got beat in the trade , at his own game , you know , and wound up by an insult that no Irishman would take ; and Tommy just naturally wore out the hall carpet of the old hotel with him ! ”</p>
     <p>“ And then collared and led him to the mayor 's office himself , they say ! ”</p>
     <p>“ Oh , he did ! ” said the Major , with a dash of pride in the confirmation ; “ that 's Tommy all over ! ”</p>
     <p>“ Funny trial , was n't it ? ” continued the ruminating Stockford .</p>
     <p>“ Was n't it though ? ” laughed the Major .</p>
     <p>“ The porter 's testimony : You see , he was for Tommy , of course , and on examination testified that the horse-man struck Tommy first . And there Tommy broke in with : ‘ He 's a-meanin ’ well , yer Honor , but he 's lyin ’ to ye — he 's lyin ’ to ye . No livin ’ man iver struck me first — nor last , nayther , for the matter o ’ that ! ’ And I thought — the — court — would — die ! ” concluded the Major , in a like imminent state of merriment .</p>
     <p>“ Yes , and he said if he struck him first , ” supplemented Stockford , “ he 'd like to know why the horseman was ‘ wearin ’ all the black eyes , and the blood , and the boomps on the head of um ! ’ And it 's that talk of his that got him off with so light a fine ! ”</p>
     <p>“ As it always does , ” said the Major , coming to himself abruptly and looking at his watch . “ Stock ’ , you say you 're not going along with our duck-shooting party this time ? The old Kankakee is just lousy with ‘ em this season ! ”</p>
     <p>“ Ca n't go possibly , ” said Stockford , “ not on account of the work at all , but the folks at home ai n't just as well as I 'd like to see them , and I 'll stay here till they 're better . Next time I 'll try and be ready for you . Going to take Tommy , of course ? ”</p>
     <p>“ Of course ! Got to have ‘ The Wild Irishman ’ with us ! I 'm going around to find him now . ” Then turning to me the Major continued , “ Suppose you get on your coat and hat and come along ? It 's the best chance you 'll ever have to meet Tommy . It 's late anyhow , and Stockford 'll get along without you . Come on . ”</p>
     <p>“ Certainly , ” said Stockford ; “ go ahead . And you can take him ducking , too , if he wants to go . ”</p>
     <p>“ But he does n't want to go — and wo n't go , ” replied the Major with a commiserative glance at me . “ Says he does n't know a duck from a poll-parrot — nor how to load a shotgun — and could n't hit a house if he were inside of it and the door shut . Admits that he nearly killed his uncle once , on the other side of a tree , with a squirrel runnin ’ down it . Do n't want him along ! ”</p>
     <p>Reaching the street with the genial Major , he gave me this advice : “ Now , when you meet Tommy , you must n't take all he says for dead earnest , and you must n't believe , because he talks loud , and in italics every other word , that he wants to do all the talking and wo n't be interfered with . That 's the way he 's apt to strike folks at first — but it 's their mistake , not his . Talk back to him — controvert him whenever he 's aggressive in the utterance of his opinions , and if you 're only honest in the announcement of your own ideas and beliefs , he 'll like you all the better for standing by them . He 's quick-tempered , and perhaps a trifle sensitive , so share your greater patience with him , and he 'll pay you back by fighting for you at the drop of the hat . In short , he 's as nearly typical of his gallant country 's brave , impetuous , fun-loving individuality as such a likeness can exist . ”</p>
     <p>“ But is he quarrelsome ? ” I asked .</p>
     <p>“ Not at all . There 's the trouble . If he 'd only quarrel there 'd be no harm done . Quarreling 's cheap , and Tommy 's extravagant . A big blacksmith here , the other day , kicked some boy out of his shop , and Tommy , on his cart , happened to be passing at the time ; and he just jumped off without a word , and went in and worked on that fellow for about three minutes , with such disastrous results that they could n't tell his shop from a slaughter-house ; paid an assault and battery fine , and gave the boy a dollar beside , and the whole thing was a positive luxury to him . But I guess we 'd better drop the subject , for here 's his cart , and here 's Tommy . Hi ! there , you Far-down ‘ Irish Mick ! ” called the Major , in affected antipathy , “ been out raiding the honest farmers ’ hen-roosts again , have you ? ”</p>
     <p>We had halted at a corner grocery and produce store , as I took it , and the smooth-faced , shave-headed man in woolen shirt , short vest , and suspenderless trousers so boisterously addressed by the Major , was just lifting from the back of his cart a coop of cackling chickens .</p>
     <p>“ Arrah ! ye blasted Kerryonian ! ” replied the handsome fellow , depositing the coop on the curb and straightening his tall , slender figure ; “ I were jist thinking of yez and the ducks , and here ye come quackin ’ into the prisence of r'yalty , wid yer canvas-back suit upon ye and the shwim-skins bechuxt yer toes ! How air yez , anyhow — and air we startin ’ for the Kankakee by the nixt post ? ”</p>
     <p>“ We 're to start just as soon as we get the boys together , ” said the Major , shaking hands . “ The crowd 's to be at Andrews ’ by 4 , and it 's fully that now ; so come on at once . We 'll go ‘ round by Munson 's and have Hi send a boy to look after your horse . Come ; and I want to introduce my friend here to you , and we 'll all want to smoke and jabber a little in appropriate seclusion . Come on . ” And the impatient Major had linked arms with his hesitating ally and myself , and was turning the corner of the street .</p>

       <l n="1">“ It 's an hour 's work I have yet wid the squawkers , ” mildly protested</l>
       <l n="2">Tommy , still hanging back and stepping a trifle high ; “ but , as one</l>
       <l n="3">Irishman would say til another , ‘ Ye 're wrong , but I 'm wid ye ! ’ ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="4">And five minutes later the three of us had joined a very jolly party</l>
       <l n="5">in a snug back room , with</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="6">“ The chamber walls depicted all around</l>
       <l n="7">With portraitures of huntsman , hawk , and hound ,</l>

      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>and where , as well , drifted over the olfactory intelligence a certain subtle , warm-breathed aroma , that genially combatted the chill and darkness of the day without , and , resurrecting long-dead Christmases , brimmed the grateful memory with all comfortable cheer .</p>
     <p>A dozen hearty voices greeted the appearance of Tommy and the Major , the latter adroitly pushing the jovial Irishman to the front , with a mock-heroic introduction to the general company , at the conclusion of which Tommy , with his hat tucked under the left elbow , stood bowing with a grace of pose and presence Lord Chesterfield might have applauded .</p>
     <p>“ Gintlemen , ” said Tommy , settling back upon his heels and admiringly contemplating the group ; “ Gintlemen , I congratu-late yez wid a pride that shoves the thumbs o ’ me into the arrum-holes of me weshkit ! At the inshtigation of the bowld O'Blowney — axin ’ the gintleman 's pardon — I am here wid no silver tongue of illoquence to para-lyze yez , but I am prisent , as has been ripresinted , to jine wid yez in a stupendeous waste of gun-powder , and duck-shot , and ‘ high-wines , ’ and ham sand-witches , upon the silvonian banks of the ragin ’ Kankakee , where the ‘ di-dipper ’ tips ye good-bye wid his tail , and the wild loon skoots like a sky-rocket for his exiled home in the alien dunes of the wild morass — or , as Tommy Moore so illegantly describes the blashted birrud ,—</p>

       <l n="1">‘ Away to the dizhmal shwamp he shpeeds —</l>
       <l n="2">His path is rugged and sore ,</l>
       <l n="3">Through tangled juniper , beds of reeds ,</l>
       <l n="4">And many a fen where the serpent feeds ,</l>
       <l n="5">And birrud niver flew before —</l>
       <l n="6">And niver will fly any more</l>
     </lg>
     <p>if iver he arrives back safe into civilization again — and I 've been in the poultry business long enough to know the private opinion and personal integrity of ivery fowl that flies the air or roosts on poles . But , changin ’ the subject of my few small remarks here , and thankin yez wid an overflowin ’ heart but a dhry tongue , I have the honor to propose , gintlemen , long life and health to ivery mother 's o ’ yez , and success to the ‘ Duck-hunters of Kankakee . ’ ”</p>
     <p>“ The duck-hunters of the Kankakee ! ” chorussed the elated party in such musical uproar that for a full minute the voice of the enthusiastic Major — who was trying to say something — could not be heard . Then he said :</p>
     <p>“ I want to propose that theme — ‘ The Duck-hunters of the Kankakee ’ , for one of Tommy 's improvizations . I move we have a song now from Tommy on the ‘ Duck-hunters of the Kankakee . ’ ”</p>
     <p>“ Hurra ! Hurra ! A song from Tommy , ” cried the crowd . “ Make us up a song , and put us all into it ! A song from Tommy ! A song ! A song ! ”</p>
     <p>There was a queer light in the eye of the Irishman . I observed him narrowly — expectantly . Often I had read of this phenomenal art of improvised ballad-singing , but had always remained a little skeptical in regard to the possibility of such a feat . Even in the notable instances of this gift as displayed by the very clever Theodore Hook , I had always half suspected some prior preparation — some adroit forecasting of the sequence that seemed the instant inspiration of his witty verses .</p>
     <p>Here was evidently to be a test example , and I was all alert to mark its minutest detail .</p>
     <p>The clamor had subsided , and Tommy had drawn a chair near to and directly fronting the Major 's . His right hand was extended , closely grasping the right hand of his friend which he scarce perceptibly , though measuredly , lifted and let fall throughout the length of all the curious performance . The voice was not unmusical , nor was the quaint old ballad-air adopted by the singer unlovely in the least ; simply a monotony was evident that accorded with the levity and chance-finish of the improvisation — and that the song was improvised on the instant I am certain — though in no wise remarkable , for other reasons , in rhythmic worth or finish . And while his smiling auditors all drew nearer , and leant , with parted lips to catch every syllable , the words of the strange melody trailed unhesitatingly into the lines literally as here subjoined :</p>
     <lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">“ One gloomy day in the airly Fall ,</l>
       <l n="2">Whin the sunshine had no chance at all —</l>
       <l n="3">No chance at all for to gleam and shine</l>
       <l n="4">And lighten up this heart of mine :</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="5">“ ‘ Twas in South Bend , that famous town ,</l>
       <l n="6">Whilst I were a-strollin ’ round and round ,</l>
       <l n="7">I met some friends and they says to me :</l>
       <l n="8">‘ It 's a hunt we 'll take on the Kankakee ! ’ ”</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>“ Hurra for the Kankakee ! Give it to us , Tommy ! ” cried an enthused voice between verses . “ Now give it to the Major ! ” And the song went on :—</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">“ There 's Major Blowney leads the van ,</l>
       <l n="2">As crack a shot as an Irishman ,—</l>
       <l n="3">For its the duck is a tin decoy</l>
       <l n="4">That his owld shotgun can n't destroy ! ”</l>
     </lg>
     <p>And a half a dozen jubilant palms patted the Major 's shoulders , and his ruddy , good-natured face beamed with delight . “ Now give it to the rest of ‘ em , Tommy ! ” chuckled the Major . And the song continued :—</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">“ And along wid ‘ Hank ’ is Mick Maharr ,</l>
       <l n="2">And Barney Pince , at ‘ The Shamrock ’ bar —</l>
       <l n="3">There 's Barney Pinch , wid his heart so true ;</l>
       <l n="4">And the Andrews Brothers they 'll go too . ”</l>
     </lg>
     <p>“ Hold on , Tommy ! ” chipped in one of the Andrews ; “ you must give ‘ the Andrews Brothers ’ a better advertisement than that ! Turn us on a full verse , can n't you ? ”</p>
     <lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">“ Make ‘ em pay for it if you do ! ” said the Major , in an undertone . And</l>
       <l n="2">Tommy promptly amended :—</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="3">“ O , the Andrews Brothers , they 'll be there ,</l>
       <l n="4">Wid good se-gyars and wine to shpare ,—</l>
       <l n="5">They 'll treat us here on fine champagne ,</l>
       <l n="6">And whin we 're there they ‘ ll treat us again . ”</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>The applause here was vociferous , and only discontinued when a box of Havanas stood open on the table . During the momentary lull thus occasioned , I caught the Major 's twinkling eyes glancing evasively toward me , as he leant whispering some further instructions to Tommy , who again took up his desultory ballad , while I turned and fled for the street , catching , however , as I went , and high above the laughter of the crowd , the satire of this quatrain to its latest line —</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">“ But R-R-Riley he ‘ ll not go , I guess ,</l>
       <l n="2">Lest he 'd get lost in the wil-der-ness ,</l>
       <l n="3">And so in the city he will shtop</l>
       <l n="4">For to curl his hair in the barber shop . ”</l>
     </lg>
     <p>It was after six when I reached the hotel , but I had my hair trimmed before I went in to supper . The style of trimming adopted then I still rigidly adhere to , and call it “ the Tommy Stafford stubble-crop . ”</p>
     <p>Ten days passed before I again saw the Major . Immediately upon his return — it was late afternoon when I heard of it — I determined to take my evening walk out the long street toward his pleasant home and call upon him there . This I did , and found him in a wholesome state of fatigue , slippers and easy chair , enjoying his pipe on the piazza . Of course , he was overflowing with happy reminiscences of the hunt — the wood-and-water-craft — boats — ambushes — decoys , and tramp , and camp , and so on , without end ;— but I wanted to hear him talk of “ The Wild Irishman ” — Tommy ; and I think , too , now , that the sagacious Major secretly read my desires all the time . To be utterly frank with the reader I will admit that I not only think the Major divined my interest in Tommy , but I know he did ; for at last , as though reading my very thoughts , he abruptly said , after a long pause , in which he knocked the ashes from his pipe and refilled and lighted it :— “ Well , all I know of ‘ The Wild Irishman ’ I can tell you in a very few words — that is , if you care at all to listen ? ” And the crafty old Major seemed to hesitate .</p>
     <p>“ Go on — go on ! ” I said , eagerly .</p>
     <p>“ About forty years ago , ” resumed the Major , placidly , “ in the little , old , unheard-of town Karnteel , County Tyrone , Province Ulster , Ireland , Tommy Stafford — in spite of the contrary opinion of his wretchedly poor parents — was fortunate enough to be born . And here , again , as I advised you the other day , you must be prepared for constant surprises in the study of Tommy 's character . ”</p>
     <p>“ Go on , ” I said ; “ I 'm prepared for anything . ”</p>
     <p>The Major smiled profoundly and continued :—</p>
     <p>“ Fifteen years ago , when he came to America — and the Lord only knows how he got the passage-money — he brought his widowed mother with him here , and has supported , and is still supporting her . Besides , ” went on the still secretly smiling Major , “ the fellow has actually found time , through all his adversities , to pick up quite a smattering of education , here and there — ”</p>
     <p>“ Poor fellow ! ” I broke in , sympathizingly , “ what a pity it is that he could n't have had such advantages earlier in life , ” and as I recalled the broad brogue of the fellow , together with his careless dress , recognizing beneath it all the native talent and brilliancy of a mind of most uncommon worth , I could not restrain a deep sigh of compassion and regret .</p>
     <p>The Major was leaning forward in the gathering dusk , and evidently studying my own face , the expression of which , at that moment , was very grave and solemn , I am sure . He suddenly threw himself backward in his chair , in an uncontrollable burst of laughter . “ Oh , I just can n't keep it up any longer , ” he exclaimed .</p>
     <p>“ Keep what up ? ” I queried , in a perfect maze of bewilderment and surprise . “ Keep what up ? ” I repeated .</p>
     <p>“ Why , all this twaddle , farce , travesty and by-play regarding Tommy ! You know I warned you , over and over , and you must n't blame me for the deception . I never thought you 'd take it so in earnest ! ” and here the jovial Major again went into convulsions of laughter .</p>
     <p>“ But I do n't understand a word of it all , ” I cried , half frenzied with the gnarl and tangle of the whole affair . “ What ‘ twaddle , farce and by-play , ’ is it anyhow ? ” And in my vexation , I found myself on my feet and striding nervously up and down the paved walk that joined the street with the piazza , pausing at last and confronting the Major almost petulantly . “ Please explain , ” I said , controlling my vexation with an effort .</p>
     <p>The Major arose . “ Your striding up and down there reminds me that a little stroll on the street might do us both good , ” he said . “ Will you wait until I get a coat and hat ? ”</p>
     <p>He rejoined me a moment later , and we passed through the open gate ; and saying , “ Let 's go down this way , ” he took my arm and turned into a street , where , cooling as the dusk was , the thick maples lining the walk , seemed to throw a special shade of tranquility upon us .</p>
     <p>“ What I meant was ” — began the Major , in low , serious voice ,— “ What I meant was — simply this : Our friend Tommy , though the truest Irishman in the world , is a man quite the opposite everyway of the character he has appeared to you . All that rich brogue of his is assumed . Though he 's poor , as I told you , when he came here , his native quickness , and his marvelous resources , tact , judgment , business qualities — all have helped him to the equivalent of a liberal education . His love of the humorous and the ridiculous is unbounded ; but he has serious moments , as well , and at such times is as dignified and refined in speech and manner as any man you 'd find in a thousand . He is a good speaker , can stir a political convention to fomentation when he gets fired up ; and can write an article for the press that goes spang to the spot . He gets into a great many personal encounters of a rather undignified character ; but they are almost invariably bred of his innate interest in the ‘ under dog , ’ and the fire and tow of his impetuous nature . ”</p>
     <p>My companion had paused here , and was looking through some printed slips in his pocket-book . “ I wanted you to see some of the fellow 's articles in print , but I have nothing of importance here — only some of his ‘ doggerel , ’ as he calls it , and you 've had a sample of that . But here 's a bit of the upper spirit of the man — and still another that you should hear him recite . You can keep them both if you care to . The boys all fell in love with that last one , particularly , hearing his rendition of it . So we had a lot printed , and I have two or three left . Put these two in your pocket and read at your leisure . ”</p>
     <p>But I read them there and then , as eagerly , too , as I append them here and now . The first is called —</p>

     <p>“ Before we turn back , now , ” said the smiling Major , as I stood lingering over the indefinable humor of the last refrain , “ before we turn back I want to show you something eminently characteristic . Come this way a half dozen steps . ”</p>
     <p>As he spoke I looked up , to first observe that we had paused before a handsome square brick residence , centering a beautiful smooth lawn , its emerald only littered with the light gold of the earliest autumn leaves . On either side of the trim walk that led up from the gate to the carved stone ballusters of the broad piazza , with its empty easy chairs , were graceful vases , frothing over with late blossoms , and wreathed with laurel-looking vines ; and , luxuriantly lacing the border of the pave that turned the further corner of the house , blue , white and crimson , pink and violet , went fading in perspective as my gaze followed the gesture of the Major 's .</p>
     <p>“ Here , come a little further . Now do you see that man there ? ”</p>
     <p>Yes , I could make out a figure in the deepening dusk — the figure of a man on the back stoop — a tired looking man , in his shirt-sleeves , who sat upon a low chair — no , not a chair — an empty box . He was leaning forward with his elbows on his knees , and the hands dropped limp . He was smoking , too , I could barely see his pipe , and but for the odor of very strong tobacco , would not have known he had a pipe . Why does the master of the house permit his servants to so desecrate this beautiful home ? I thought .</p>
     <p>“ Well , shall we go now ? ” said the Major .</p>
     <p>I turned silently and we retraced our steps . I think neither of us spoke for the distance of a square .</p>
     <lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">“ Guess you did n't know the man there on the back porch ? ” said the</l>
       <l n="2">Major .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="3">“ No ; why ? ” I asked dubiously .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="4">“ I hardly thought you would , and besides the poor fellow 's tired , and</l>
       <l n="5">it was best not to disturb him , ” said the Major .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="6">“ Why ; who was it — some one I know ? ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="7">“ It was Tommy . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="8">“ Oh , ” said I , inquiringly , “ he 's employed there in some capacity ? ”</l>

       <l n="9">“ Yes , as master of the house . ”</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="10">“ You do n't mean it ? ”</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>“ I certainly do . He owns it , and made every cent of the money that paid for it ! ” said the Major proudly . “ That 's why I wanted you particularly to note that ‘ eminent characteristic ’ I spoke of . Tommy could just as well be sitting , with a fine cigar , on the front piazza in an easy chair , as , with his dhudeen , on the back porch , on an empty box , where every night you 'll find him . Its the unconscious dropping back into the old ways of his father , and his father 's father , and his father 's father 's father . In brief , he sits there the poor lorn symbol of the long oppression of his race . ”</p>

     <p>THE GILDED ROLL .</p>
     <p>Nosing around in an old box — packed away , and lost to memory for years — an hour ago I found a musty package of gilt paper , or rather , a roll it was , with the green-tarnished gold of the old sheet for the outer wrapper . I picked it up mechanically to toss it into some obscure corner , when , carelessly lifting it by one end , a child 's tin whistle dropped therefrom and fell tinkling on the attic floor . It lies before me on my writing table now — and so , too , does the roll entire , though now a roll no longer ,— for my eager fingers have unrolled the gilded covering , and all its precious contents are spread out beneath my hungry eyes .</p>
     <p>Here is a scroll of ink-written music . I do n't read music , but I know the dash and swing of the pen that rained it on the page . Here is a letter , with the self-same impulse and abandon in every syllable ; and its melody — however sweet the other — is far more sweet to me . And here are other letters like it — three — five — and seven , at least . Bob wrote them from the front , and Billy kept them for me when I went to join him . Dear boy ! Dear boy !</p>
     <p>Here are some cards of bristol-board . Ah ! when Bob came to these there were no blotches then . What faces — what expressions ! The droll , ridiculous , good-for-nothing genius , with his “ sad mouth , ” as he called it , “ upside down , ” laughing always — at everything , at big rallies , and mass-meetings and conventions , county fairs , and floral halls , booths , watermelon-wagons , dancing-tents , the swing , Daguerrean-car , the “ lung-barometer , ” and the air-gun man . Oh ! what a gifted , good-for-nothing boy Bob was in those old days ! And here ‘ s a picture of a girlish face — a very faded photograph — even fresh from “ the gallery , ” five and twenty years ago it was a faded thing . But the living face — how bright and clear that was !— for “ Doc , ” Bob 's awful name for her , was a pretty girl , and brilliant , clever , lovable every way . No wonder Bob fancied her ! And you could see some hint of her jaunty loveliness in every fairy face he drew , and you could find her happy ways and dainty tastes unconsciously assumed in all he did — the books he read — the poems he admired , and those he wrote ; and , ringing clear and pure and jubilant , the vibrant beauty of her voice could clearly be defined and traced through all his music . Now , there 's the happy pair of them — Bob and Doc . Make of them just whatever your good fancy may dictate , but keep in mind the stern , relentless ways of destiny .</p>
     <p>You are not at the beginning of a novel , only at the threshold of one of a hundred experiences that lie buried in the past , and this particular one most happily resurrected by these odds and ends found in the gilded roll .</p>
     <p>You see , dating away back , the contents of this package , mainly , were hastily gathered together after a week 's visit out at the old Mills farm ; the gilt paper , and the whistle , and the pictures , they were Billy 's ; the music pages , Bob 's , or Doc 's ; the letters and some other manuscripts were mine .</p>
     <p>The Mills girls were great friends of Doc 's , and often came to visit her in town ; and so Doc often visited the Mills 's . This is the way that Bob first got out there , and won them all , and “ shaped the thing ” for me , as he would put it ; and lastly , we had lugged in Billy ,— such a handy boy , you know , to hold the horses on picnic excursions , and to watch the carriage and the luncheon , and all that .— “ Yes , and , ” Bob would say , “ such a serviceable boy in getting all the fishing tackle in proper order , and digging bait , and promenading in our wake up and down the creek all day , with the minnow-bucket hanging on his arm , do n't you know ! ”</p>
     <p>But jolly as the days were , I think jollier were the long evenings at the farm . After the supper in the grove , where , when the weather permitted , always stood the table , ankle-deep in the cool green plush of the sward ; and after the lounge upon the grass , and the cigars , and the new fish stories , and the general invoice of the old ones , it was delectable to get back to the girls again , and in the old “ best room ” hear once more the lilt of the old songs and the stacattoed laughter of the piano mingling with the alto and falsetto voices of the Mills girls , and the gallant soprano of the dear girl Doc .</p>
     <p>This is the scene I want you to look in upon , as , in fancy , I do now — and here are the materials for it all , husked from the gilded roll :</p>
     <p>Bob , the master , leans at the piano now , and Doc is at the keys , her glad face often thrown up sidewise toward his own . His face is boyish — for there is yet but the ghost of a mustache upon his lip . His eyes are dark and clear , of over-size when looking at you , but now their lids are drooped above his violin , whose melody has , for the time , almost smoothed away the upward kinkings of the corners of his mouth . And wonderfully quiet now is every one , and the chords of the piano , too , are low and faltering ; and so , at last , the tune itself swoons into the universal hush , and — Bob is rasping , in its stead , the ridiculous , but marvelously perfect imitation of the “ priming ” of a pump , while Billy 's hands forget the “ chiggers ” on the bare backs of his feet , as , with clapping palms , he dances round the room in ungovernable spasms of delight . And then we all laugh ; and Billy , taking advantage of the general tumult , pulls Bob 's head down and whispers , “ Git ‘ em to stay up ‘ way late to-night ! ” And Bob , perhaps remembering that we go back home to-morrow , winks at the little fellow and whispers , “ You let me manage ‘ em ! Stay up till broad daylight if we take a notion — eh ? ” And Billy dances off again in newer glee , while the inspired musician is plunking a banjo imitation on his enchanted instrument , which is unceremoniously drowned out by a circus-tune from Doc that is absolutely inspiring to everyone but the barefooted brother , who drops back listlessly to his old position on the floor and sullenly renews operations on his “ chigger ” claims .</p>
     <p>“ Thought you was goin ’ to have pop-corn to-night all so fast ! ” he says , doggedly , in the midst of a momentary lull that has fallen on a game of whist . And then the oldest Mills girl , who thinks cards stupid anyhow , says : “ That 's so , Billy ; and we 're going to have it , too ; and right away , for this game 's just ending , and I sha n't submit to being bored with another . I say ‘ pop-corn ’ with Billy ! And after that , ” she continues , rising and addressing the party in general , “ we must have another literary and artistic tournament , and that 's been in contemplation and preparation long enough ; so you gentlemen can be pulling your wits together for the exercises , while us girls see to the refreshments . ”</p>
     <p>“ Have you done anything toward it ! ” queries Bob , when the girls are gone , with the alert Billy in their wake .</p>
     <p>“ Just an outline , ” I reply . “ How with you ? ”</p>
     <p>“ Clean forgot it — that is , the preparation ; but I 've got a little old second-hand idea , if you 'll all help me out with it , that 'll amuse us some , and tickle Billy I 'm certain . ”</p>
     <p>So that 's agreed upon ; and while Bob produces his portfolio , drawing paper , pencils and so on , I turn to my note-book in a dazed way and begin counting my fingers in a depth of profound abstraction , from which I am barely aroused by the reappearance of the girls and Billy .</p>
     <p>“ Goody , goody , goody ! Bob 's goin ’ to make pictures ! ” cries Billy , in additional transport to that the cake pop-corn has produced .</p>
     <p>“ Now , you girls , ” says Bob , gently detaching the affectionate Billy from one leg and moving a chair to the table , with a backward glance of intelligence toward the boy ,— “ you girls are to help us all you can , and we can all work ; but , as I 'll have all the illustrations to do , I want you to do as many of the verses as you can — that 'll be easy , you know ,— because the work entire is just to consist of a series of fool-epigrams , such as , for instance .— Listen , Billy :</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">Here lies a young man</l>
       <l n="2">Who in childhood began</l>
       <l n="3">To swear , and to smoke , and to drink ,—</l>
       <l n="4">In his twentieth year</l>
       <l n="5">He quit swearing and beer ,</l>
       <l n="6">And yet is still smoking , I think . ”</l>
     </lg>
     <p>And the rest of his instructions are delivered in lower tones , that the boy may not hear ; and then , all matters seemingly arranged , he turns to the boy with — “ And now , Billy , no lookin ’ over shoulders , you know , or swinging on my chair-back while I 'm at work . When the pictures are all finished , then you can take a squint at ‘ em , and not before . Is that all hunky , now ? ”</p>
     <p>“ Oh ! who 's a-goin ’ to look over your shoulder — only Doc . ” And as the radiant Doc hastily quits that very post , and dives for the offending brother , he scrambles under the piano and laughs derisively .</p>
     <p>And then a silence falls upon the group — a gracious quiet , only intruded upon by the very juicy and exuberant munching of an apple from a remote fastness of the room , and the occasional thumping of a bare heel against the floor .</p>
     <p>At last I close my note-book with a half slam .</p>
     <p>“ That means , ” says Bob , laying down his pencil , and addressing the girls ,— “ That means he 's concluded his poem , and that he 's not pleased with it in any manner , and that he intends declining to read it , for that self-acknowledged reason , and that he expects us to believe every affected word of his entire speech — ”</p>
     <p>“ Oh , do n't ! ” I exclaim .</p>
     <p>“ Then give us the wretched production , in all its hideous deformity ! ”</p>
     <p>And the girls all laugh so sympathetically , and Bob joins them so gently , and yet with a tone , I know , that can be changed so quickly to my further discomfiture , that I arise at once and read , without apology or excuse , this primitive and very callow poem recovered here to-day from the gilded roll :</p>

     <p>The crude production is received , I am glad to note , with some expressions of favor from the company , though Bob , of course , must heartlessly dissipate my weak delight by saying , “ Well , it 's certainly bad enough ; though , ” he goes on with an air of deepest critical sagacity and fairness , “ considered , as it should be , justly , as the production of a jour-poet , why , it might be worse — that is , a little worse . ”</p>
     <p>“ Probably , ” I remember saying ,— “ Probably I might redeem myself by reading you this little amateurish bit of verse , enclosed to me in a letter by mistake , not very long ago . ” I here fish an envelope from my pocket the address of which all recognize as in Bob 's almost printed writing . He smiles vacantly at it — then vividly colors .</p>
     <p>“ What date ? ” he stoically asks .</p>
     <p>“ The date , ” I suggestively answer , “ of your last letter to our dear Doc , at Boarding-School , two days exactly in advance of her coming home — this veritable visit now . ”</p>
     <p>Both Bob and Doc rush at me — but too late . The letter and contents have wholly vanished . The youngest Miss Mills quiets us — urgently distracting us , in fact , by calling our attention to the immediate completion of our joint production ; “ For now , ” she says , “ with our new reinforcement , we can , with becoming diligence , soon have it ready for both printer and engraver , and then we 'll wake up the boy ( who has been fortunately slumbering for the last quarter of an hour ) , and present to him , as designed and intended , this matchless creation of our united intellects . ” At the conclusion of this speech we all go good-humoredly to work , and at the close of half an hour the tedious , but most ridiculous , task is announced completed .</p>
     <p>As I arrange and place in proper form here on the table the separate cards — twenty-seven in number — I sigh to think that I am unable to transcribe for you the best part of the nonsensical work — the illustrations . All I can give is the written copy of —</p>

She will read a poem , she says , written by a very dear friend of hers who , fortunately for us , is not present to prevent her . We guard door and window as she reads .
