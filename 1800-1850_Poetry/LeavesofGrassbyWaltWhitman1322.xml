    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">A young man comes to me bearing a message from his brother ,</l>
     <l n="2">How shall the young man know the whether and when of his brother ?</l>
     <l n="3">Tell him to send me the signs . And I stand before the young man</l>
     <l n="4">face to face , and take his right hand in my left hand and his</l>
     <l n="5">left hand in my right hand ,</l>
     <l n="6">And I answer for his brother and for men , and I answer for him that</l>
     <l n="7">answers for all , and send these signs .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="8">Him all wait for , him all yield up to , his word is decisive and final ,</l>
     <l n="9">Him they accept , in him lave , in him perceive themselves as amid light ,</l>
     <l n="10">Him they immerse and he immerses them .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="11">Beautiful women , the haughtiest nations , laws , the landscape ,</l>
     <l n="12">people , animals ,</l>
     <l n="13">The profound earth and its attributes and the unquiet ocean , ( so</l>
     <l n="14">tell I my morning 's romanza ,)</l>
     <l n="15">All enjoyments and properties and money , and whatever money will buy ,</l>
     <l n="16">The best farms , others toiling and planting and he unavoidably reaps ,</l>
     <l n="17">The noblest and costliest cities , others grading and building and he</l>
     <l n="18">domiciles there ,</l>
     <l n="19">Nothing for any one but what is for him , near and far are for him ,</l>
     <l n="20">the ships in the offing ,</l>
     <l n="21">The perpetual shows and marches on land are for him if they are for anybody .</l>

   <p>He puts things in their attitudes , He puts to-day out of himself with plasticity and love , He places his own times , reminiscences , parents , brothers and sisters , associations , employment , politics , so that the rest never shame them afterward , nor assume to command them .</p>
   <p>He is the Answerer , What can be answer 'd he answers , and what cannot be answer 'd he shows how it cannot be answer 'd .</p>
   <p>A man is a summons and challenge , ( It is vain to skulk — do you hear that mocking and laughter ? do you hear the ironical echoes ? )</p>
   <p>Books , friendships , philosophers , priests , action , pleasure , pride , beat up and down seeking to give satisfaction , He indicates the satisfaction , and indicates them that beat up and down also .</p>
   <p>Whichever the sex , whatever the season or place , he may go freshly and gently and safely by day or by night , He has the pass-key of hearts , to him the response of the prying of hands on the knobs .</p>
   <p>His welcome is universal , the flow of beauty is not more welcome or universal than he is , The person he favors by day or sleeps with at night is blessed .</p>
   <p>Every existence has its idiom , every thing has an idiom and tongue , He resolves all tongues into his own and bestows it upon men , and any man translates , and any man translates himself also , One part does not counteract another part , he is the joiner , he sees how they join .</p>
   <p>He says indifferently and alike How are you friend ? to the President at his levee , And he says Good-day my brother , to Cudge that hoes in the sugar-field , And both understand him and know that his speech is right .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">He walks with perfect ease in the capitol ,</l>
     <l n="2">He walks among the Congress , and one Representative says to another ,</l>
     <l n="3">Here is our equal appearing and new .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="4">Then the mechanics take him for a mechanic ,</l>
     <l n="5">And the soldiers suppose him to be a soldier , and the sailors that</l>
     <l n="6">he has follow 'd the sea ,</l>
     <l n="7">And the authors take him for an author , and the artists for an artist ,</l>
     <l n="8">And the laborers perceive he could labor with them and love them ,</l>
     <l n="9">No matter what the work is , that he is the one to follow it or has</l>
     <l n="10">follow 'd it ,</l>
     <l n="11">No matter what the nation , that he might find his brothers and</l>
     <l n="12">sisters there .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>The English believe he comes of their English stock , A Jew to the Jew he seems , a Russ to the Russ , usual and near , removed from none .</p>
   <p>Whoever he looks at in the traveler 's coffee-house claims him , The Italian or Frenchman is sure , the German is sure , the Spaniard is sure , and the island Cuban is sure , The engineer , the deck-hand on the great lakes , or on the Mississippi or St. Lawrence or Sacramento , or Hudson or Paumanok sound , claims him .</p>
   <p>The gentleman of perfect blood acknowledges his perfect blood , The insulter , the prostitute , the angry person , the beggar , see themselves in the ways of him , he strangely transmutes them , They are not vile any more , they hardly know themselves they are so grown .</p>

     <l n="2">The indications and tally of time ,</l>
     <l n="3">Perfect sanity shows the master among philosophs ,</l>
     <l n="4">Time , always without break , indicates itself in parts ,</l>
     <l n="5">What always indicates the poet is the crowd of the pleasant company</l>
     <l n="6">of singers , and their words ,</l>
     <l n="7">The words of the singers are the hours or minutes of the light or dark ,</l>
     <l n="8">but the words of the maker of poems are the general light and dark ,</l>
     <l n="9">The maker of poems settles justice , reality , immortality ,</l>
     <l n="10">His insight and power encircle things and the human race ,</l>
     <l n="11">He is the glory and extract thus far of things and of the human race .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The singers do not beget , only the Poet begets , The singers are welcom 'd , understood , appear often enough , but rare has the day been , likewise the spot , of the birth of the maker of poems , the Answerer , ( Not every century nor every five centuries has contain 'd such a day , for all its names . )</p>
   <p>The singers of successive hours of centuries may have ostensible names , but the name of each of them is one of the singers , The name of each is , eye-singer , ear-singer , head-singer , sweet-singer , night-singer , parlor-singer , love-singer , weird-singer , or something else .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">All this time and at all times wait the words of true poems ,</l>
     <l n="2">The words of true poems do not merely please ,</l>
     <l n="3">The true poets are not followers of beauty but the august masters of beauty ;</l>
     <l n="4">The greatness of sons is the exuding of the greatness of mothers</l>
     <l n="5">and fathers ,</l>
     <l n="6">The words of true poems are the tuft and final applause of science .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Divine instinct , breadth of vision , the law of reason , health , rudeness of body , withdrawnness , Gayety , sun-tan , air-sweetness , such are some of the words of poems .</p>
   <p>The sailor and traveler underlie the maker of poems , the Answerer , The builder , geometer , chemist , anatomist , phrenologist , artist , all these underlie the maker of poems , the Answerer .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">The words of the true poems give you more than poems ,</l>
     <l n="2">They give you to form for yourself poems , religions , politics , war ,</l>
     <l n="3">peace , behavior , histories , essays , daily life , and every thing else ,</l>
     <l n="4">They balance ranks , colors , races , creeds , and the sexes ,</l>
     <l n="5">They do not seek beauty , they are sought ,</l>
     <l n="6">Forever touching them or close upon them follows beauty , longing ,</l>
     <l n="7">fain , love-sick .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="8">They prepare for death , yet are they not the finish , but rather the outset ,</l>
     <l n="9">They bring none to his or her terminus or to be content and full ,</l>
     <l n="10">Whom they take they take into space to behold the birth of stars , to</l>
     <l n="11">learn one of the meanings ,</l>
     <l n="12">To launch off with absolute faith , to sweep through the ceaseless</l>
     <l n="13">rings and never be quiet again .</l>

   <p>O to make the most jubilant song ! Full of music — full of manhood , womanhood , infancy ! Full of common employments — full of grain and trees .</p>
   <p>O for the voices of animals — O for the swiftness and balance of fishes ! O for the dropping of raindrops in a song ! O for the sunshine and motion of waves in a song !</p>

   <p>O the engineer 's joys ! to go with a locomotive ! To hear the hiss of steam , the merry shriek , the steam-whistle , the laughing locomotive ! To push with resistless way and speed off in the distance .</p>
   <p>O the gleesome saunter over fields and hillsides ! The leaves and flowers of the commonest weeds , the moist fresh stillness of the woods , The exquisite smell of the earth at daybreak , and all through the forenoon .</p>
   <p>O the horseman 's and horsewoman 's joys ! The saddle , the gallop , the pressure upon the seat , the cool gurgling by the ears and hair .</p>

   <p>Another time in warm weather out in a boat , to lift the lobster-pots where they are sunk with heavy stones , ( I know the buoys ,) O the sweetness of the Fifth-month morning upon the water as I row just before sunrise toward the buoys , I pull the wicker pots up slantingly , the dark green lobsters are desperate with their claws as I take them out , I insert wooden pegs in the ‘ oints of their pincers ,</p>

     <l n="2">Out of the cradle endlessly rocking ,</l>
     <l n="3">Out of the mocking-bird 's throat , the musical shuttle ,</l>
     <l n="4">Out of the Ninth-month midnight ,</l>
     <l n="5">Over the sterile sands and the fields beyond , where the child</l>
     <l n="6">leaving his bed wander 'd alone , bareheaded , barefoot ,</l>
     <l n="7">Down from the shower 'd halo ,</l>
     <l n="8">Up from the mystic play of shadows twining and twisting as if they</l>
     <l n="9">were alive ,</l>
     <l n="10">Out from the patches of briers and blackberries ,</l>
     <l n="11">From the memories of the bird that chanted to me ,</l>
     <l n="12">From your memories sad brother , from the fitful risings and fallings I heard ,</l>
     <l n="13">From under that yellow half-moon late-risen and swollen as if with tears ,</l>
     <l n="14">From those beginning notes of yearning and love there in the mist ,</l>
     <l n="15">From the thousand responses of my heart never to cease ,</l>
     <l n="16">From the myriad thence-arous 'd words ,</l>
     <l n="17">From the word stronger and more delicious than any ,</l>
     <l n="18">From such as now they start the scene revisiting ,</l>
     <l n="19">As a flock , twittering , rising , or overhead passing ,</l>
     <l n="20">Borne hither , ere all eludes me , hurriedly ,</l>
     <l n="21">A man , yet by these tears a little boy again ,</l>
     <l n="22">Throwing myself on the sand , confronting the waves ,</l>
     <l n="23">I , chanter of pains and joys , uniter of here and hereafter ,</l>
     <l n="24">Taking all hints to use them , but swiftly leaping beyond them ,</l>
     <l n="25">A reminiscence sing .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="2">To get betimes in Boston town I rose this morning early ,</l>
     <l n="3">Here 's a good place at the corner , I must stand and see the show .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Clear the way there Jonathan ! Way for the President 's marshal — way for the government cannon ! Way for the Federal foot and dragoons , ( and the apparitions copiously tumbling . )</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">I love to look on the Stars and Stripes , I hope the fifes will play</l>
     <l n="2">Yankee Doodle .</l>
     <l n="3">How bright shine the cutlasses of the foremost troops !</l>
     <l n="4">Every man holds his revolver , marching stiff through Boston town .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">A fog follows , antiques of the same come limping ,</l>
     <l n="6">Some appear wooden-legged , and some appear bandaged and bloodless .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Why this is indeed a show — it has called the dead out of the earth ! The old graveyards of the hills have hurried to see ! Phantoms ! phantoms countless by flank and rear ! Cock 'd hats of mothy mould — crutches made of mist ! Arms in slings — old men leaning on young men 's shoulders .</p>
   <p>What troubles you Yankee phantoms ? what is all this chattering of bare gums ? Does the ague convulse your limbs ? do you mistake your crutches for firelocks and level them ?</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">If you blind your eyes with tears you will not see the President 's marshal ,</l>
     <l n="2">If you groan such groans you might balk the government cannon .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>For shame old maniacs — bring down those toss 'd arms , and let your white hair be , Here gape your great grandsons , their wives gaze at them from the windows , See how well dress 'd , see how orderly they conduct themselves .</p>
   <p>Worse and worse — can n't you stand it ? are you retreating ? Is this hour with the living too dead for you ?</p>
   <p>Retreat then — pell-mell ! To your graves — back — back to the hills old limpers ! I do not think you belong here anyhow .</p>
   <p>But there is one thing that belongs here — shall I tell you what it is , gentlemen of Boston ?</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">I will whisper it to the Mayor , he shall send a committee to England ,</l>
     <l n="2">They shall get a grant from the Parliament , go with a cart to the</l>
     <l n="3">royal vault ,</l>
     <l n="4">Dig out King George 's coffin , unwrap him quick from the</l>
     <l n="5">graveclothes , box up his bones for a journey ,</l>
     <l n="6">Find a swift Yankee clipper — here is freight for you , black-bellied clipper ,</l>
     <l n="7">Up with your anchor — shake out your sails — steer straight toward</l>
     <l n="8">Boston bay .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Now call for the President 's marshal again , bring out the government cannon , Fetch home the roarers from Congress , make another procession , guard it with foot and dragoons .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">This centre-piece for them ;</l>
     <l n="2">Look , all orderly citizens — look from the windows , women !</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The committee open the box , set up the regal ribs , glue those that will not stay , Clap the skull on top of the ribs , and clap a crown on top of the skull . You have got your revenge , old buster — the crown is come to its own , and more than its own .</p>
   <p>Stick your hands in your pockets , Jonathan — you are a made man from this day , You are mighty cute — and here is one of your bargains .</p>
   <p>Europe [ The 72d and 73d Years of These States ]</p>
   <p>Suddenly out of its stale and drowsy lair , the lair of slaves , Like lightning it le'pt forth half startled at itself , Its feet upon the ashes and the rags , its hands tight to the throats of kings .</p>
   <p>O hope and faith ! O aching close of exiled patriots ’ lives ! O many a sicken 'd heart ! Turn back unto this day and make yourselves afresh .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">And you , paid to defile the People — you liars , mark !</l>
     <l n="2">Not for numberless agonies , murders , lusts ,</l>
     <l n="3">For court thieving in its manifold mean forms , worming from his</l>
     <l n="4">simplicity the poor man 's wages ,</l>
     <l n="5">For many a promise sworn by royal lips and broken and laugh 'd at in</l>
     <l n="6">the breaking ,</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Then in their power not for all these did the blows strike revenge , or the heads of the nobles fall ; The People scorn 'd the ferocity of kings .</p>
   <p>But the sweetness of mercy brew 'd bitter destruction , and the frighten 'd monarchs come back , Each comes in state with his train , hangman , priest , tax-gatherer , Soldier , lawyer , lord , jailer , and sycophant .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Yet behind all lowering stealing , lo , a shape ,</l>
     <l n="2">Vague as the night , draped interminably , head , front and form , in</l>
     <l n="3">scarlet folds ,</l>
     <l n="4">Whose face and eyes none may see ,</l>
     <l n="5">Out of its robes only this , the red robes lifted by the arm ,</l>
     <l n="6">One finger crook 'd pointed high over the top , like the head of a</l>
     <l n="7">snake appears .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Meanwhile corpses lie in new-made graves , bloody corpses of young men , The rope of the gibbet hangs heavily , the bullets of princes are flying , the creatures of power laugh aloud , And all these things bear fruits , and they are good .</p>
   <p>Those corpses of young men , Those martyrs that hang from the gibbets , those hearts pierc 'd by the gray lead , Cold and motionless as they seem live elsewhere with unslaughter 'd vitality .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">They live in other young men O kings !</l>

   <p>Not one word or deed , not venereal sore , discoloration , privacy of the onanist , Putridity of gluttons or rum-drinkers , peculation , cunning , betrayal , murder , seduction , prostitution , But has results beyond death as really as before death .</p>
   <p>Charity and personal force are the only investments worth any thing .</p>
   <p>No specification is necessary , all that a male or female does , that is vigorous , benevolent , clean , is so much profit to him or her , In the unshakable order of the universe and through the whole scope of it forever .</p>
   <p>Who has been wise receives interest , Savage , felon , President , judge , farmer , sailor , mechanic , literat , young , old , it is the same , The interest will come round — all will come round .</p>

   <p>I go from bedside to bedside , I sleep close with the other sleepers each in turn , I dream in my dream all the dreams of the other dreamers , And I become the other dreamers .</p>
   <p>I am a dance — play up there ! the fit is whirling me fast !</p>
   <p>I am the ever-laughing — it is new moon and twilight , I see the hiding of douceurs , I see nimble ghosts whichever way look , Cache and cache again deep in the ground and sea , and where it is neither ground nor sea .</p>

   <p>Let the reformers descend from the stands where they are forever bawling — let an idiot or insane person appear on each of the stands ; Let judges and criminals be transposed — let the prison-keepers be put in prison — let those that were prisoners take the keys ; Let them that distrust birth and death lead the rest .</p>

     <l n="1">To Think of Time</l>
   </lg>
   <p>1 To think of time — of all that retrospection , To think of to-day , and the ages continued henceforward .</p>
   <p>Have you guess 'd you yourself would not continue ? Have you dreaded these earth-beetles ? Have you fear 'd the future would be nothing to you ?</p>
   <p>Is to-day nothing ? is the beginningless past nothing ? If the future is nothing they are just as surely nothing .</p>
   <p>To think that the sun rose in the east — that men and women were flexible , real , alive — that every thing was alive , To think that you and I did not see , feel , think , nor bear our part , To think that we are now here and bear our part .</p>
   <p>2 Not a day passes , not a minute or second without an accouchement , Not a day passes , not a minute or second without a corpse .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">The dull nights go over and the dull days also ,</l>
     <l n="2">The soreness of lying so much in bed goes over ,</l>
     <l n="3">The physician after long putting off gives the silent and terrible</l>
     <l n="4">look for an answer ,</l>
     <l n="5">The children come hurried and weeping , and the brothers and sisters</l>
     <l n="6">are sent for ,</l>
     <l n="7">Medicines stand unused on the shelf , ( the camphor-smell has long</l>
     <l n="8">pervaded the rooms ,)</l>
     <l n="9">The faithful hand of the living does not desert the hand of the dying ,</l>
     <l n="10">The twitching lips press lightly on the forehead of the dying ,</l>
     <l n="11">The breath ceases and the pulse of the heart ceases ,</l>
     <l n="12">The corpse stretches on the bed and the living look upon it ,</l>
     <l n="13">It is palpable as the living are palpable .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The living look upon the corpse with their eyesight , But without eyesight lingers a different living and looks curiously on the corpse .</p>
   <p>3 To think the thought of death merged in the thought of materials , To think of all these wonders of city and country , and others taking great interest in them , and we taking no interest in them .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">To think how eager we are in building our houses ,</l>
     <l n="2">To think others shall be just as eager , and we quite indifferent .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>( I see one building the house that serves him a few years , or seventy or eighty years at most , I see one building the house that serves him longer than that . )</p>
   <p>Slow-moving and black lines creep over the whole earth — they never cease — they are the burial lines , He that was President was buried , and he that is now President shall surely be buried .</p>
   <p>4 A reminiscence of the vulgar fate , A frequent sample of the life and death of workmen , Each after his kind .</p>
   <p>Cold dash of waves at the ferry-wharf , posh and ice in the river , half-frozen mud in the streets , A gray discouraged sky overhead , the short last daylight of December , A hearse and stages , the funeral of an old Broadway stage-driver , the cortege mostly drivers .</p>
   <lg>

     <l n="1">Steady the trot to the cemetery , duly rattles the death-bell ,</l>
     <l n="2">The gate is pass 'd , the new-dug grave is halted at , the living</l>
     <l n="3">alight , the hearse uncloses ,</l>
     <l n="4">The coffin is pass 'd out , lower 'd and settled , the whip is laid on</l>
     <l n="5">the coffin , the earth is swiftly shovel 'd in ,</l>
     <l n="6">The mound above is flatted with the spades — silence ,</l>
     <l n="7">A minute — no one moves or speaks — it is done ,</l>
     <l n="8">He is decently put away — is there any thing more ?</l>

     <l n="11">hearty , drank hearty ,</l>
     <l n="12">Had known what it was to be flush , grew low-spirited toward the</l>

   <p>Thumb extended , finger uplifted , apron , cape , gloves , strap , wet-weather clothes , whip carefully chosen , Boss , spotter , starter , hostler , somebody loafing on you , you loafing on somebody , headway , man before and man behind , Good day 's work , bad day 's work , pet stock , mean stock , first out , last out , turning-in at night , To think that these are so much and so nigh to other drivers , and he there takes no interest in them .</p>
   <p>5 The markets , the government , the working-man 's wages , to think what account they are through our nights and days , To think that other working-men will make just as great account of them , yet we make little or no account .</p>

     <l n="7">But in due time you and I shall take less interest in them .</l>

   <p>Your farm , profits , crops — to think how engross 'd you are , To think there will still be farms , profits , crops , yet for you of what avail ?</p>

   <p>1 Of these years I sing , How they pass and have pass 'd through convuls 'd pains , as through parturitions , How America illustrates birth , muscular youth , the promise , the sure fulfilment , the absolute success , despite of people — illustrates evil as well as good , The vehement struggle so fierce for unity in one'shYpppHeNself , How many hold despairingly yet to the models departed , caste , myths , obedience , compulsion , and to infidelity , How few see the arrived models , the athletes , the Western States , or see freedom or spirituality , or hold any faith in results , ( But I see the athletes , and I see the results of the war glorious and inevitable , and they again leading to other results . )</p>
   <p>How the great cities appear — how the Democratic masses , turbulent , willful , as I love them , How the whirl , the contest , the wrestle of evil with good , the sounding and resounding , keep on and on , How society waits unform 'd , and is for a while between things ended and things begun , How America is the continent of glories , and of the triumph of freedom and of the Democracies , and of the fruits of society , and of all that is begun , And how the States are complete in themselves — and how all triumphs and glories are complete in themselves , to lead onward , And how these of mine and of the States will in their turn be convuls 'd , and serve other parturitions and transitions , And how all people , sights , combinations , the democratic masses too , serve — and how every fact , and war itself , with all its horrors , serves , And how now or at any time each serves the exquisite transition of death .</p>
