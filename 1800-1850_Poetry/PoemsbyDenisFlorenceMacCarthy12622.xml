    <head>PREFACE .</head>
    <p n="1">This volume contains , besides the poems published in 1850 and 1857 ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>the odes written for the centenary celebrations in honour of O'Connell in 1875 , and of Moore in 1879 . To these are added several sonnets and miscellaneous poems now first collected , and the episode of “ Ferdiah ” translated from the ‘ Tain Bo Chuailgne . ’</p>
    <p n="2">Born in Dublin ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>May 26th , 1817 , my father , while still very young , showed a decided taste for literature . The course of his boyish reading is indicated in his “ Lament . ” Some verses from his pen , headed “ My Wishes , ” appeared in the “ Dublin Satirist , ” April 12th , 1834 . This was , as far as I can discover , the earliest of his writings published . To the journal just mentioned he frequently contributed , both in prose and verse , during the next two years . The following are some of the titles :— “ The Greenwood Hill ; ” “ Songs of other Days ” ( Belshazzar 's Feast — Thoughts in the Holy Land — Thoughts of the Past ) ; “ Life , ” “ Death , ” “ Fables ” ( The Zephyr and the Sensitive Plant — The Tulip and the Rose — The Bee and the Rose ) ; “ Songs of Birds ” ( Nightingale — Eagle — Phoenix — Fire-fly ) ; “ Songs of the Winds , ” &amp; c .</p>
    <p n="3">On October 14th , 1843 , his first contribution ( “ Proclamation Songs , ” No . 1 ) appeared in the Dublin “ Nation . ” “ Here is a song by a new recruit , ” wrote Mr ., now Sir , Charles Gavan Duffy , “ which we should give in our leading columns if they were not preoccupied . ” In the next number I find “ The Battle of Clontarf , ” with this editorial note : “ ‘ Desmond ’ is entitled to be enrolled in our national brigade . ” “ A Dream ” soon follows ; and at intervals , between this date and 1849 — besides many other poems — all the National songs and most of the Ballads included in this volume . In April , 1847 , “ The Bell-Founder ” and “ The Foray of Con O'Donnell ” appeared in the “ University Magazine , ” in which “ Waiting for the May , ” “ The Bridal of the Year , ” and “ The Voyage of Saint Brendan , ” were subsequently published ( in January and May , 1848 ) . Meanwhile , in 1846 , the year in which he was called to the bar , he edited the “ Poets and Dramatists of Ireland , ” with an introduction , which evinced considerable reading , on the early religion and literature of the Irish people . In the same year he also edited the “ Book of Irish Ballads , ” to which he prefixed an introduction on ballad poetry . This volume was republished with additions and a preface in 1869 . In 1853 , the poems afterwards published under the title of “ Underglimpses ” were chiefly written .<span type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span></p>
    <p n="4">The plays of Calderon — thoroughly national in form and matter — have met with but scant appreciation from foreigners . Yet we find his genius recognized in unexpected quarters , Goethe and Shelley uniting with Augustus Schlegel and Archbishop Trench to pay him homage . My father was , I think , first led to the study of Calderon by Shelley 's glowing eulogy of the poet ( “ Essays , ” vol . ii ., p. 274 , and elsewhere ) . The first of his translations was published in 1853 , the last twenty years later . They consist<span type="note_anchor">[ 4 ]</span>of fifteen complete plays , which I believe to be the largest amount of translated verse by any one author , that has ever appeared in English . Most of it is in the difficult assonant or vowel rhyme , hardly ever previously attempted in our language . This may be a fitting place to cite a few testimonies as to the execution of the work . Longfellow , whom I have myself heard speak of the “ Autos ” in a way that showed how deeply he had studied them in the original , wrote , in 1857 : “ You are doing this work admirably , and seem to gain new strength and sweetness as you go on . It seems as if Calderon himself were behind you whispering and suggesting . And what better work could you do in your bright hours or in your dark hours that just this , which seems to have been put providentially into your hands . ” Again , in 1862 : “ Your new work in the vast and flowery fields of Calderon is , I think , admirable , and presents the old Spanish dramatist before the English reader in a very attractive light . Particularly in the most poetical passages you are excellent ; as , for instance , in the fine description of the gerfalcon and the heron in ‘ El Mayor Encanto . ’ I hope you mean to add more and more , so as to make the translation as nearly complete as a single life will permit . It seems rather appalling to undertake the whole of so voluminous a writer ; nevertheless , I hope you will do it . Having proved that you can , perhaps you ought to do it . This may be your appointed work . It is a noble one . "[ 5 ] Ticknor ( “ History of Spanish Literature , ” new edition , vol . iii . p. 461 ) writes thus : “ Calderon is a poet who , whenever he is translated , should have his very excesses and extravagances , both in thought and manner , fully reproduced , in order to give a faithful idea of what is grandest and most distinctive in his genius . Mr. MacCarthy has done this , I conceive , to a degree which I had previously supposed impossible . Nothing , I think , in the English language will give us so true an impression of what is most characteristic of the Spanish drama ; perhaps I ought to say , of what is most characteristic of Spanish poetry generally . ”</p>
    <p n="5">Another eminent Hispaniologist ( Mr. C. F. Bradford , of Boston ) has spoken of the work in similar terms . His labours did not pass without recognition from the great dramatist 's countrymen . He was elected a member of the Real Academia some years ago , and in 1881 this learned body presented him with the medal struck in commemoration of Calderon 's bicentenary , “ in token of their gratitude and their appreciation of his translations of the great poet 's works . ”</p>
    <p n="6">In 1855 , at the request of the Marchioness of Donegal , my father wrote the ode which was recited at the inauguration of the statue of her son , the Earl of Belfast . About the same time , his Lectures on Poetry were delivered at the Catholic University at the desire of Cardinal Newman . The Lectures on the Poets of Spain , and on the Dramatists of the Sixteenth Century , were delivered a few years later . In 1862 he published a curious bibliographical treatise on the “ Memoires of the Marquis de Villars . ” In 1864 the ill-health of some of his family his leaving his home near Killiney Hill<span type="note_anchor">[ 6 ]</span>to reside on the Continent . In 1872 , “ Shelley 's Early Life ” was published in London , where he had settled , attracted by the facilities for research which its great libraries offered . This biography gives an amusing account of the young poet 's visit to Dublin in 1812 , and some new details of his adventures and writings at this period . My father 's admiration for Shelley was of long standing . At the age of seventeen he wrote some lines to the poet 's memory , which appeared in the “ Dublin Satirist ” already mentioned , and an elaborate review of his poetry in an early number of the Nation . I have before alluded to Shelley 's influence in directing his attention to Calderon . The centenary odes in honour of O'Connell and Moore were written , in 1875 and 1879 , at the request of the committees which had charge of these celebrations . He returned to Ireland a few months before his death , which took place at Blackrock , near Dublin , on April 7th ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 7 ]</span>in the present year . His nature was most sensitive , but though it was his lot to suffer many sorrows , I never heard a complaint or and unkind word from his lips .</p>
    <p n="7">From what has been said it will be evident that this volume contains only a part of his poetical works , it having been found impossible to include the humorous pieces , parodies , and epigrams , without some acquaintance with which an imperfect idea would be formed of his genius . The same may be said of his numerous translations from various languages ( exclusive of Calderon 's plays ) . Of those published in 1850 , “ The Romance of Maleca , ” “ Saint George 's Knight , ” “ The Christmas of the Foreign Child , ” and others have been frequently reprinted . He has since rendered from the Spanish poems by Juan de Pedraza , Antonio de Trueba , Garcilaso de la Vega , Gongora and “ Fernan Caballero , ” whom he visited when in Spain shortly before her death , and whose prose story , “ The Two Muleteers , ” he has also translated . To these must be added , besides several shorter ballads from Duran 's Romancero General , “ The Poem of the Cid , ” “ The Romance of Gayferos , ” and “ The Infanta of France . ” The last is a metrical tale of the fourteenth or fifteenth century , presenting analogies with the “ Thousand and One Nights , ” and probably drawn from an Oriental source . His translations from the Latin , chiefly of mediaeval hymns , are also numerous .</p>

    <docImprint>In inserting the poem of “ Ferdiah ” I was influenced by its subject as well as by the wish of friends . A few extracts appeared in a magazine several years ago , and it was afterwards completed without any view to publication . It follows the present Irish text<span type="note_anchor">[ 8 ]</span>as closely as the laws of metre will allow . Since these pages were in the printer 's hands Mr. Aubrey de Vere has given to the world his treatment of the same theme ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 9 ]</span>adorning as usual all that he touches . As he well says : “ It is not in the form of translation that an ancient Irish tale of any considerable length admits of being rendered in poetry . What is needed is to select from the original such portions as are at once the most essential to the story , and the most characteristic , reproducing them in a condensed form , and taking care that the necessary additions bring out the idea , and contain nothing that is not in the spirit of the original . ” ( Preface , p . vii . ) The “ Tale of Troy Divine ” owes its form , and we may never know how much of its tenderness and grace , to its Alexandrian editor . However , the present version may , from its very literalness , have and interest for some readers . Many of the earlier poems here collected have been admirably rendered into French by the late M. Ernest de Chatelain .<span type="note_anchor">[ 10 ]</span>The Moore Centenary Ode has been translated into Latin by the Rev . M. J. Blacker , M. A . My thanks are due to the Rev . Matthew Russell , S. J ., for his kind assistance in preparing this book for the press , and to the Publishers for the accuracy and speed with which it has been produced . I cannot let pass this opportunity of expressing my gratitude for the self-sacrificing labours of the committee formed at the suggestion of Mr. William Lane Joynt , D. L ., to honour my father 's memory , and for the generous response his friends have made to their appeal .<span type="note_anchor">[ 11 ]</span>JOHN MAC CARTHY Blackrock ,<settlement>Dublin</settlement>, August ,<date>1882</date>. 1 . “ Ballads , Poems , and Lyrics , Original and Translated : ”<settlement>Dublin</settlement>,<date>1850</date>. “ The Bell-Founder , and other Poems , ” “ Underglimpses , and other Poems : ”<settlement>London</settlement>,<date>1857</date>. A few pieces which seemed not to be of abiding interest have been omitted . 2 . At 24 Lower Sackville-street . The house , with others adjoining , was pulled down several years ago . Their site is now occupied by the Imperial Hotel . 3 . The subjective view of nature developed in these Poems has been censured as remote from human interest . Yet a critic of deep insight , George Gilfillan , declares his special admiration for “ the joyous , sunny , lark-like carols on May , almost worthy of Shelley , and such delicate , tender , Moore-like ‘ trifles ’ ( shall I call them ? ) as ‘ All Fool 's Day . ’ The whole ” he adds , “ is full of a beautiful poetic spirit , and rich resources both of fancy and language . ” I may be permitted to transcribe here an extract from some unpublished comments by Sir William Rowan Hamilton on another poem of the same class . His remarks are interesting in themselves , as coming from one illustrious as a man of science , and , at the same time , a true poet — a combination which may hereafter become more frequent , since already in the vast regions of space and time brought within human ken , imagination strives hard to keep pace with established fact . In a manuscript volume now in the Library of Trinity College ,<settlement>Dublin</settlement>, he writes , under date , May ,<date>1848</date>:— “ The University Magazine for the present month contains a poem which delights one , entitled ‘ The Bridal of the Year . ’ It is signed ‘ D. F. M. C ., ’ as is also a shorter , but almost a sweeter piece immediately following it , and headed , ‘ Summer Longings . ’ ” Sir William goes through the whole poem , copying and criticising every stanza , and concludes as follows :— “ After a very pretty ninth stanza respecting the ‘ fairy phantoms ’ in the poet 's ‘ glorious visions seen , ’ which the author conceives to ‘ follow the poet 's steps beneath the morning 's beam , ’ he burst into rapture at the approach of the Bride herself — “ ‘ Bright as are the planets seven — with her glances She advances , For her azure eyes are Heaven ! And her robes are sunbeams woven , And her beauteous bridesmaids are Hopes and wishes — Dreams delicious — Joys from some serener star , And Heavenly-hued Illusions gleaming from afar ! ’ “ Her eyes ‘ are ’ heaven , her robes ‘ are ’ sunbeams , and with these physical aspects of the May , how well does the author of this ode ( for such , surely , we may term the poem , so rich in lyrical enthusiasm and varied melody ) conceive the combination as bridesmaids , as companions to the bride ; of those mental feelings , those new buddings of hope in the heart which the season is fitted to awaken . The azure eyes glitter back to ours , for the planets shine upon us from the lovely summer night ; but lovelier still are those ‘ dreams delicious , joys from some serener star , ’ which at the same sweet season float down invisibly , and win their entrance to our souls . The image of a bridal is happily and naturally kept before us in the remaining stanzas of this poem , which well deserve to be copied here , in continuation of these notes — the former for its cheerfulness , the latter for its sweetness . I wish that I knew the author , or even that I were acquainted with his name .— Since ascertained to be D. F. MacCarthy . ” 4 . The following are the titles and dates of publication : In<date>1853</date>, “ The Constant Prince , ” “ The Secret in Words , ” “ The Physician of his own Honour , ” “ Love after Death , ” “ The Purgatory of St. Patrick , ” “ The Scarf and the Flower . ” In<date>1861</date>, “ The Greatest Enchantment , ” “ The Sorceries of Sin , ” “ Devotion of the Cross . ” In<date>1867</date>, “ Belshazzar 's Feast , ” “ The Divine Philothea ” ( with Essays from the German of Lorinser , and the Spanish of Gonzales Pedroso ) . In<date>1870</date>, “ Chrysanthus and Daria , the Two Lovers of Heaven . ” In<date>1873</date>, “ The Wonder-working Magician , ” “ Life is a Dream , ” “ The Purgatory of St. Patrick ” ( a new translation entirely in the assonant metre ) . Introductions and notes are added to all these plays . Another , “ Daybreak in Copacabana , ” was finished a few months before his death , and has not been published . 5 . When the author of “ Evangeline ” visited Europe for the last time in<date>1869</date>, they met in<country>Italy</country>. The sonnets at p. 174 [ To Henry Wadsworth Longfellow ] refer to this occasion . 6 . The “ Campo de Estio , ” described in the lines “ Not Known . ” 7 . A fortnight after that of Longfellow . His attached friend and early associate , Thomas D'Arcy M'Gee , perished by assassination at Ottawa on the same day and month fourteen years ago . 8 . Edited by his friend Br . W. K. Sullivan , President of Queen 's College , Cork , who , I may add , has in preparation a paper on the “ Voyage of St. Brendan , ” and on other ancient Irish accounts of voyages , of which he finds an explanation in Keltic mythology . The paper will appear in the Transactions of the American Geographical Society . 9 . “ The Combat at the Ford ” being Fragment III . of his “ Legends of Ireland 's Heroic Age . ”<settlement>London</settlement>,<date>1882</date>. 10 .

     <l n="42">OR , THE FIGHT AT THE FORD .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="43">An Episode from the Ancient Irish Epic Romance , “ The Tain Bo Cuailgne ;</l>
     <l n="44">or , the Cattle Prey of Cuailgne . ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>[ “ The ‘ Tain Bo Cuailgne ’ ” says the late Professor O'Curry , “ is to Irish what the Argonautic Expedition , or the Seven against Thebes , is to Grecian history . ” For an account of this , perhaps the earliest epic romance of Western Europe , see the Professor 's “ Lectures on the Manuscript Materials of Irish History . ”</p>
   <p>The Fight of Cuchullin with Ferdiah took place in the modern county of Louth , at the ford of Ardee , which still preserves the name of the departed champion , Ardee being the softened form of ‘ Ath Ferdiah , ’ or Ferdiah 's Ford .</p>
   <p>The circumstances under which this famous combat took place are thus succinctly mentioned by O'Curry , in his description of the Tain Bo Cuailgne :—</p>
   <p>“ Cuchulainn confronts the invaders of his province , demands single combat , and conjures his opponents by the laws of Irish chivalry ( the ‘ Fir comhlainn ’ ) not to advance farther until they had conquered him . This demand , in accordance with the Irish laws of warfare , is granted ; and then the whole contest is resolved into a succession of single combats , in each of which Cuchulainn was victorious . ” — “ Lectures , ” p. 37 .</p>
   <p>The original Irish text of this episode , with a literal translation , on which the present metrical version is founded , may be consulted in the appendix to the second series of the Lectures by O'Curry , vol . ii ., p. 413 .</p>
   <p>The date assigned to the famous expedition of the Tain Bo Cuailgne , and consequently to the episode which forms the subject of the present poem , is the close of the century immediately preceding the commencement of the Christian era . This will account for the complete absence of all Christian allusions , so remarkable throughout the poem : an additional proof , if that were required , of its extreme antiquity . ]</p>

     <l n="1">Cuchullin the great chief had pitched his tent ,</l>
     <l n="2">From Samhain<span type="note_anchor">[ 29 ]</span>time , till now ‘ twas budding spring ,</l>
     <l n="3">Fast by the Ford , and held the land at bay .</l>
     <l n="4">All Erin , save the fragment that he led ,</l>
     <l n="5">His sword held back , nor dared a man to cross</l>
     <l n="6">The rippling Ford without Cuchullin 's leave :</l>
     <l n="7">Chief after chief had fallen in the attempt ;</l>
     <l n="8">And now the men of Erin through the night</l>
     <l n="9">Asked in dismay , “ Oh ! who shall be the next</l>
     <l n="10">To face the northern hound<span type="note_anchor">[ 30 ]</span>and free the Ford ? ”</l>
     <l n="11">“ Let it now be , ” with one accord they cried ,</l>
     <l n="12">“ Ferdiah , son of Daman Dare 's son ,</l>
     <l n="13">Of Domnann<span type="note_anchor">[ 31 ]</span>lord , and all its warrior men . ”</l>
     <l n="14">The chiefs thus fated now to meet as foes</l>
     <l n="15">In early life were friends — had both been taught</l>
     <l n="16">All feats of arms by the same skilful hands</l>
     <l n="17">In Scatha 's<span type="note_anchor">[ 32 ]</span>school beneath the peaks of Skye ,</l>
     <l n="18">Which still preserve Cuchullin 's glorious name .</l>
     <l n="19">One feat of arms alone Cuchullin knew</l>
     <l n="20">Ferdiah knew not of — the fatal cast —</l>
     <l n="21">The dread expanding force of the gaebulg<span type="note_anchor">[ 33 ]</span></l>
     <l n="22">Flung from the foot resistless on the foe .</l>
     <l n="23">But , on the other hand , Ferdiah wore</l>
     <l n="24">A skin-protecting suit of flashing steel<span type="note_anchor">[ 34 ]</span></l>
     <l n="25">Surpassing all in Erin known till then .</l>
     <l n="26">At length the council closed , and to the chief</l>
     <l n="27">Heralds were sent to tell them that the choice</l>
     <l n="28">That night had fallen on him ; but he within</l>
     <l n="29">His tent retired , received them not , nor went .</l>
     <l n="30">For well he knew the purport of their suit</l>
     <l n="31">Was this — that he should fight beside the Ford</l>
     <l n="32">His former fellow-pupil and his friend .</l>
     <l n="33">Then Mave ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 35 ]</span>the queen , her powerful druids sent ,</l>
     <l n="34">Armed not alone with satire 's scorpion stings ,</l>
     <l n="35">But with the magic power even on the face ,</l>
     <l n="36">By their malevolent taunts and biting sneers ,</l>
     <l n="37">To raise three blistering blots<span type="note_anchor">[ 36 ]</span>that typified</l>
     <l n="38">Disgrace , dishonour , and a coward 's shame ,</l>
     <l n="39">Which with their mortal venom him would kill ,</l>
     <l n="40">Or on the hour , or ere nine days had sped ,</l>
     <l n="41">If he declined the combat , and refused</l>
     <l n="42">Upon the instant to come forth with them ,</l>
     <l n="43">And so , for honour 's sake , Ferdiah came .</l>
     <l n="44">For he preferred to die a warrior 's death ,</l>
     <l n="45">Pierced to the heart by a proud foeman 's spear ,</l>
     <l n="46">Than by the serpent sting of slanderous tongues —</l>
     <l n="47">By satire and abuse , and foul reproach .</l>
     <l n="48">When to the court he came , where the great queen</l>
     <l n="49">Held revel , he received all due respect :</l>
     <l n="50">The sweet intoxicating cup went round ,</l>
     <l n="51">And soon Ferdiah felt the power of wine .</l>
     <l n="52">Great were the rich rewards then promised him</l>
     <l n="53">For going forth to battle with the Hound :</l>
     <l n="54">A chariot worth seven cumals four times told ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 37 ]</span></l>
     <l n="55">The outfit then of twelve well-chosen men</l>
     <l n="56">Made of more colours than the rainbow knows ,</l>
     <l n="57">His own broad plains of level fair Magh Aie ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 38 ]</span></l>
     <l n="58">To him and his assured till time was o'er</l>
     <l n="59">Free of all tribute , without fee or fine ;</l>
     <l n="60">The golden brooch , too , from the queen 's own cloak ,</l>
     <l n="61">And , above all , fair Finavair<span type="note_anchor">[ 39 ]</span>for wife .</l>
     <l n="62">But doubtful was Ferdiah of the queen ,</l>
     <l n="63">And half excited by the fiery cup ,</l>
     <l n="64">And half distrustful , knowing wily Mave ,</l>
     <l n="65">He asked for more assurance of her faith .</l>
     <l n="66">Then she to him , in rhythmic rise of song ,</l>
     <l n="67">And he in measured ranns to her replied .</l>

     <l n="1">A rich reward of golden rings</l>

   </lg>
   <p>MAVE .</p>
   <p>I 'll give a champion 's guarantee , and with thee here a compact make , That in the assemblies thou shalt be no longer bound thy place to take ; Rich silver-bitted bridles fair — for such each noble neck demands — And gallant steeds that paw the air , shall all be given into thy hands . For thou , Ferdiah , art indeed a truly brave and valorous man , The first of all the chiefs I lead , the foremost hero in the van ; My chosen champion now thou art , my dearest friend henceforth thou'lt be , The very closest to my heart , from every toll and tribute free .</p>
   <p>FERDIAH .</p>
   <p>Without securities , I say , united with thy royal word , I will not go , when breaks the day , to seek the combat at the Ford . That contest , while time runs its course , and fame records what ne'er should die , Shall live for ever in full force , until the judgment day draws nigh . I will not go , though death ensue , though thou through some demoniac rite , Even as thy druid sorcerers do , canst kill me with thy words of might : I will not go the Ford to free , until , O queen ! thou here dost swear By sun and moon ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 41 ]</span>by land and sea , by all the powers of earth and air .</p>

   <p>FERDIAH .</p>
   <p>I will have six securities , no less will I accept from thee ; Be some our country 's deities , the lords of earth , and sky , and sea ; Be some thy dearest ones , O queen ! the darlings of thy heart and eye , Before my fatal fall is seen to-morrow , when the hosts draw nigh . Do this , and though I lose my fame — do this , and though my life I lose , The glorious championship I 'll claim , the glorious risk will not refuse . On , on , in equal strength and might shall I advance , O queenly Mave , And Uladh 's hero meet in fight , and battle with Cuchullin brave .</p>
   <p>MAVE .</p>
   <p>Though Domnal<span type="note_anchor">[ 42 ]</span>it should be , the sun , swift-speeding in his fiery car ; Though Niaman 's<span type="note_anchor">[ 43 ]</span>dread name be one , the consort of the God of War ; These , even these I 'll give , though hard to lure them from their realms serene , For though they list to lowliest bard ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 44 ]</span>they may be deaf unto a queen . Bind it on Morand , if thou wilt , to make assurance doubly sure ; Bind it , nor dream that dream of guilt that such a pact will not endure . By spirits of the wave and wind , by every spell , by every art , Bind Carpri Min of Manand , bind my sons , the darlings of my heart .</p>
   <p>FERDIAH .</p>
   <p>O Mave ! with venom of deceit that adder tongue of thine o'erflows , Nor is thy temper over-sweet , as well thine earlier consort knows . Thou'rt truly worthy of thy fame for boastful speech and lust of power , And well dost thou deserve thy name — the Brachail of Rathcroghan 's tower .<span type="note_anchor">[ 45 ]</span>Thy words are fair and soft , O queen ! but still I crave one further proof — Give me the scarf of silken sheen , give me the speckled satin woof , Give from thy cloak 's empurpled fold the golden brooch so fair to see , And when the glorious gift I hold , for ever am I bound to thee .</p>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>MAVE .</head>
    <head>Oh ! art thou not my chosen chief , my foremost champion , sure to win , My tower , my fortress of relief , to whom I give this twisted pin ? These , and a thousand gifts more rare , the treasures of the earth and sea , Jewels a queen herself might wear , my grateful hands will give to thee . And when at length beneath thy sword the Hound of Ulster shall lie low , When thou hast ope 'd the long-locked Ford , and let the unguarded water flow , Then shall I give my daughter 's hand , then my own child shall be thy bride — She , the fair daughter of the land where western Elgga 's<span type="note_anchor">[ 46 ]</span>waters glide .</head>
     <l n="1">And thus did Mave Ferdiah bind to fight</l>
     <l n="2">Six chosen champions on the morrow morn ,</l>
     <l n="3">Or combat with Cuchullin all alone ,</l>
     <l n="4">Whichever might to him the easier seem .</l>
     <l n="5">And he , by the gods ’ names and by her sons ,</l>
     <l n="6">Bound her the promise she had made to keep ,</l>
     <l n="7">The rich reward to pay to him in full ,</l>
     <l n="8">If by his hand Cuchullin should be slain .</l>
     <l n="9">For Fergus , young Cuchullin 's early friend ,</l>
     <l n="10">The steeds that night were harnessed , and he flew</l>
     <l n="11">Swift in his chariot to the hero 's tent .</l>
     <l n="12">“ Glad am I at thy coming , O my friend ! ”</l>
     <l n="13">Cuchullin said : “ My pupil , I accept</l>
     <l n="14">With joy thy welcome , ” Fergus quick replied :</l>
     <l n="15">“ But what I come for is to give thee news</l>
     <l n="16">Of him who here will fight thee in the morn . ”</l>
     <l n="17">“ I listen , ” said Cuchullin , “ do thou speak . ”</l>
     <l n="18">“ Thine own companion is it , thine own peer ,</l>
     <l n="19">Thy rival in all daring feats of arms ,</l>
     <l n="20">Ferdiah , son of Daman , Dare 's son ,</l>
     <l n="21">Of Domnand lord and all its warrior men . ”</l>
     <l n="22">“ Be sure of this , ” Cuchullin made reply ,</l>
     <l n="23">“ That never wish of mine it could have been</l>
     <l n="24">A friend should thus come forth with me to fight . ”</l>
     <l n="25">“ It therefore doth behove thee now , my son , ”</l>
     <l n="26">Fergus replied , “ to be upon thy guard ,</l>
     <l n="27">Prepared at every point ; for not like those</l>
     <l n="28">Who hitherto have come to fight with thee</l>
     <l n="29">Upon the ‘ Tain Bo Cuailgne , ’ is the chief ,</l>
     <l n="30">Ferdiah , son of Daman , Dare 's son . ”</l>
     <l n="31">“ Here I have been , ” Cuchullin proudly said ,</l>
     <l n="32">“ From Samhain up to Imbule — from the first</l>
     <l n="33">Of winter days even to the first of spring —</l>
     <l n="34">Holding the four great provinces in check</l>
     <l n="35">That make up Erin , not one foot have I</l>
     <l n="36">Yielded to any man in all that time ,</l>
     <l n="37">Nor even to him shall I a foot give way . ”</l>
     <l n="38">And thus the parley went : first Fergus spoke ,</l>
     <l n="39">Cuchullin then to him in turn replied :</l>

     <l n="19">Nor was their chief less troubled ; but at first</l>

     <l n="26">From off his couch , and bade his charioteer</l>

     <l n="12">For yester morn the choice was given to me . ”</l>
     <l n="13">“ Let us , ” Ferdiah answered , “ then resort</l>
     <l n="14">Unto our heavy , sharp , hard-smiting swords ,</l>
     <l n="15">For we are nearer to the end to-day</l>
     <l n="16">Of this our fight , by hewing , than we were</l>
     <l n="17">On yesterday by thrusting of the spears . ”</l>
     <l n="18">“ So let us do , indeed , ” Cuchullin said .</l>
     <l n="19">Then on their arms two long great shields they took ,</l>
     <l n="20">And in their hands their sharp , hard-smiting swords .</l>
     <l n="21">Each hewed the other with such furious strokes</l>
     <l n="22">That pieces larger than an infant 's head</l>
     <l n="23">Of four weeks ’ old were cut from out the thighs</l>
     <l n="24">And great broad shoulder-blades of each brave chief .</l>
     <l n="25">And thus they persevered from early morn</l>
     <l n="26">Till evening 's close in hewing with the swords .</l>
     <l n="27">“ Let us desist , ” at length Ferdiah said .</l>
     <l n="28">“ Let us indeed desist , if the fit time</l>
     <l n="29">Hath come , ” Cuchullin said ; and so they ceased .</l>
     <l n="30">From them they cast their arms into the hands</l>
     <l n="31">Of their two charioteers ; and though that morn</l>
     <l n="32">Their meeting was of two high-spirited men ,</l>
     <l n="33">Their separation , now that night had come ,</l>
     <l n="34">Was of two men dispirited and sad .</l>
     <l n="35">Their horses were not in one field that night ,</l>
     <l n="36">Their charioteers were warmed not at one fire .</l>
     <l n="37">That night they rested there , and in the morn</l>
     <l n="38">Ferdiah early rose and sought alone</l>
     <l n="39">The Ford of battle , for he knew that day</l>
     <l n="40">Would end the fight , and that the hour drew nigh</l>
     <l n="41">When one or both of them should surely fall .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="42">Then was it for the first time he put on</l>
     <l n="43">His battle suit of battle and of fight ,</l>
     <l n="44">Before Cuchullin came unto the Ford .</l>
     <l n="45">That battle suit of battle and of fight</l>
     <l n="46">Was this : His apron of white silk , with fringe</l>
     <l n="47">Of spangled gold around it , he put on</l>
     <l n="48">Next his white skin . A leather apron then ,</l>
     <l n="49">Well sewn , upon his body 's lower part</l>
     <l n="50">He placed , and over it a mighty stone</l>
     <l n="51">As large as any mill-stone was secured .</l>
     <l n="52">His firm , deep , iron apron then he braced</l>
     <l n="53">Over the mighty stone — an apron made</l>
     <l n="54">Of iron purified from every dross —</l>
     <l n="55">Such dread had he that day of the Gaebulg .</l>
     <l n="56">His crested helm of battle on his head</l>
     <l n="57">He last put on — a helmet all ablaze</l>
     <l n="58">From forty gems in each compartment set ,</l>
     <l n="59">Cruan , and crystal , carbuncles of fire ,</l>
     <l n="60">And brilliant rubies of the Eastern world .</l>
     <l n="61">In his right hand a mighty spear he seized ,</l>
     <l n="62">Destructive , sharply-pointed , straight and strong :—</l>
     <l n="63">On his left side his sword of battle swung ,</l>
     <l n="64">Curved , with its hilt and pommel of red gold .</l>
     <l n="65">Upon the slope of his broad back he placed</l>
     <l n="66">His dazzling shield , around whose margin rose</l>
     <l n="67">Fifty huge bosses , each of such a size</l>
     <l n="68">That on it might a full-grown hog recline ,</l>
     <l n="69">Exclusive of the larger central boss</l>
     <l n="70">That raised its prominent round of pure red gold .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="71">Full many noble , varied , wondrous feats</l>
     <l n="72">Ferdiah on that day displayed , which he</l>
     <l n="73">Had never learned at any tutor 's hand ,</l>
     <l n="74">From Uatha , or from Aife , or from her ,</l>
     <l n="75">Scatha , his early nurse in lonely Skye :—</l>
     <l n="76">But which were all invented by himself</l>
     <l n="77">That day , to bring about Cuchullin 's fall .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="78">Cuchullin to the Ford approached and saw</l>
     <l n="79">The many noble , varied , wondrous feats</l>
     <l n="80">Ferdiah on that day displayed on high .</l>
     <l n="81">“ O Laegh , my friend , ” Cuchullin thus addressed</l>
     <l n="82">His charioteer , “ I see the wondrous feats</l>
     <l n="83">Ferdiah doth display on high to-day :</l>
     <l n="84">All these on me in turn shall soon be tried ,</l>
     <l n="85">And therefore note , that if it so should chance</l>
     <l n="86">I shall be first to yield , be sure to taunt ,</l>
     <l n="87">Excite , revile me , and reproach me so ,</l>
     <l n="88">That wrath and rage in me may rise the more :—</l>
     <l n="89">If I prevail , then let thy words be praise ,</l>
     <l n="90">Laud me , congratulate me , do thy best</l>
     <l n="91">To stimulate my courage to its height . ”</l>
     <l n="92">“ It shall be done , Cuchullin , ” Laegh replied .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="93">Then was it that Cuchullin first assumed</l>
     <l n="94">His battle suit of battle : then he tried</l>
     <l n="95">Full many , various , noble , wondrous feats</l>
     <l n="96">He never learned from any tutor 's hands ,</l>
     <l n="97">From Uatha , or from Aife , or from her ,</l>
     <l n="98">Scatha , his early nurse in lonely Skye .</l>
     <l n="99">Ferdiah saw these various feats , and knew</l>
     <l n="100">Against himself they soon would be applied .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="101">“ Say , O Ferdiah , to what arms shall we</l>
     <l n="102">Resort in this day 's fight ? ” Cuchullin said .</l>
     <l n="103">Ferdiah answered , “ Unto thee belongs</l>
     <l n="104">The choice of weapons now until the night . ”</l>
     <l n="105">“ Let us then try the Ford Feat on this day , ”</l>
     <l n="106">Replied Cuchullin . “ Let us then , indeed , ”</l>
     <l n="107">Rejoined Ferdiah , with a careless air</l>
     <l n="108">Consenting , though in truth it was to him</l>
     <l n="109">The cause of grief to say so , since he knew</l>
     <l n="110">That in the Ford Feat lay Cuchullin 's strength ,</l>
     <l n="111">And that he never failed to overthrow</l>
     <l n="112">Champion or hero in that last appeal .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="113">Great was the feat that was performed that day</l>
     <l n="114">In and beside the Ford : the mighty two ,</l>
     <l n="115">The two great heroes , warriors , champions , chiefs</l>
     <l n="116">Of western Europe — the two open hands</l>
     <l n="117">Laden with gifts of the north-western world ,—</l>
     <l n="118">The two beloved pillars that upheld</l>
     <l n="119">The valour of the Gaels — the two strong keys</l>
     <l n="120">That kept the bravery of the Gaels secure —</l>
     <l n="121">Thus to be brought together from afar</l>
     <l n="122">To fight each other through the meddling schemes</l>
     <l n="123">Of Ailill and his wily partner Mave .</l>
     <l n="124">From each to each the missive weapons flew</l>
     <l n="125">From dawn of early morning to mid-day ;</l>
     <l n="126">And when mid-day had come , the ire of both</l>
     <l n="127">Became more furious , and they drew more near .</l>
     <l n="128">Then was it that Cuchullin made a spring</l>
     <l n="129">From the Ford 's brink , and came upon the boss</l>
     <l n="130">Of the great shield Ferdiah 's arm upheld ,</l>
     <l n="131">That thus he might , above the broad shield 's rim ,</l>
     <l n="132">Strike at his head . Ferdiah with a touch</l>
     <l n="133">Of his left elbow , gave the shield a shake</l>
     <l n="134">And cast Cuchullin from him like a bird ,</l>
     <l n="135">Back to the brink of the Ford . Again he sprang</l>
     <l n="136">From the Ford 's brink , and came upon the boss</l>
     <l n="137">Of the great shield once more , to strike his head</l>
     <l n="138">Over the rim . Ferdiah with a stroke</l>
     <l n="139">Of his left knee made the great shield to ring ,</l>
     <l n="140">And cast Cuchullin back upon the brink ,</l>
     <l n="141">As if he only were a little child .</l>
     <l n="142">Laegh saw the act . “ Alas ! indeed , ” said Laegh ,</l>
     <l n="143">“ The warrior casts thee from him in the way</l>
     <l n="144">That an abandoned woman would her child .</l>
     <l n="145">He flings thee as a river flings its foam ;</l>
     <l n="146">He grinds thee as a mill would grind fresh malt ;</l>
     <l n="147">He fells thee as the axe does fell the oak ;</l>
     <l n="148">He binds thee as the woodbine binds the tree ;</l>
     <l n="149">He darts upon thee as a hawk doth dart</l>
     <l n="150">Upon small birds , so that from this hour forth</l>
     <l n="151">Until the end of time , thou hast no claim</l>
     <l n="152">Or title to be called a valorous man :</l>
     <l n="153">Thou little puny phantom form , ” said Laegh .</l>
     <l n="154">Then with the rapid motion of the wind ,</l>
     <l n="155">The fleetness of a swallow on the wing ,</l>
     <l n="156">The fierceness of a dragon , and the strength</l>
     <l n="157">Of a roused lion , once again up sprang</l>
     <l n="158">Cuchullin , high into the troubled air ,</l>
     <l n="159">And lighted for the third time on the boss</l>
     <l n="160">Of the broad shield , to strike Ferdiah 's head</l>
     <l n="161">Over the rim . The warrior shook the shield ,</l>
     <l n="162">And cast Cuchullin mid-way in the Ford ,</l>
     <l n="163">With such an easy effort that it seemed</l>
     <l n="164">As if he scarcely deigned to shake him off .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="165">Then , as he lay , a strange distortion came</l>
     <l n="166">Upon Cuchullin ; as a bladder swells</l>
     <l n="167">Inflated by the breath , to such a size</l>
     <l n="168">And fulness did he grow , that he became</l>
     <l n="169">A fearful , many-coloured , wondrous Tuaig —</l>
     <l n="170">Gigantic shape , as big as a man of the sea ,</l>
     <l n="171">Or monstrous Fomor , so that now his form</l>
     <l n="172">In perfect height over Ferdiah stood .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="173">So close the fight was now , that their heads met</l>
     <l n="174">Above , their feet below , their arms half-way</l>
     <l n="175">Over the rims and bosses of their shields :—</l>
     <l n="176">So close the fight was now , that from their rims</l>
     <l n="177">Unto their centres were their shields cut through ,</l>
     <l n="178">And loosed was every rivet from its hold ;</l>
     <l n="179">So close the fight was now , that their strong spears</l>
     <l n="180">Were turned and bent and shivered point and haft ;</l>
     <l n="181">Such was the closeness of the fight they made</l>
     <l n="182">That the invisible and unearthly hosts</l>
     <l n="183">Of Spirits , Bocanachs and Bananachs ,</l>
     <l n="184">And the wild wizard people of the glen</l>
     <l n="185">And of the air the demons , shrieked and screamed</l>
     <l n="186">From their broad shields ’ reverberating rim ,</l>
     <l n="187">From their sword-hilts and their long-shafted spears :</l>
     <l n="188">Such was the closeness of the fight they made ,</l>
     <l n="189">They forced the river from its natural course ,</l>
     <l n="190">Out of its bed , so that it might have been</l>
     <l n="191">A couch whereon a king or queen might lie ,</l>
     <l n="192">For not a drop of water it retained ,</l>
     <l n="193">Except what came from the great tramp and splash</l>
     <l n="194">Of the two heroes fighting in its midst .</l>
     <l n="195">Such was the fierceness of the fight they waged ,</l>
     <l n="196">That a wild fury seized upon the steeds</l>
     <l n="197">The Gaels had gathered with them ; in affright</l>
     <l n="198">They burst their traces and their binding ropes ,</l>
     <l n="199">Nay even their chains , and panting fled away .</l>
     <l n="200">The women , too , and youths , by equal fears</l>
     <l n="201">Inspired and scared , and all the varied crowd</l>
     <l n="202">Of followers and non-combatants who there</l>
     <l n="203">Were with the men of Erin , from the camp</l>
     <l n="204">South-westward broke away , and fled the Ford .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="205">At the edge-feat of swords they were engaged</l>
     <l n="206">When this surprise occurred , and it was then</l>
     <l n="207">Ferdiah an unguarded moment found</l>
     <l n="208">Upon Cuchullin , and he struck him deep ,</l>
     <l n="209">Plunging his straight-edged sword up to the hilt</l>
     <l n="210">Within his body , till his girdle filled</l>
     <l n="211">With blood , and all the Ford ran red with gore</l>
     <l n="212">From the brave battle-warrior 's veins outshed .</l>
     <l n="213">This could Cuchullin now no longer bear</l>
     <l n="214">Because Ferdiah still the unguarded spot</l>
     <l n="215">Struck and re-struck with quick , strong , stubborn strokes ;</l>
     <l n="216">And so he called aloud to Laegh , the son</l>
     <l n="217">Of Riangabra , for the dread Gaebulg .</l>
     <l n="218">The manner of that fearful feat was this :</l>
     <l n="219">Adown the current was it sent , and caught</l>
     <l n="220">Between the toes : a single spear would make</l>
     <l n="221">The wound it made when entering , but once lodged</l>
     <l n="222">Within the body , thirty barbs outsprung ,</l>
     <l n="223">So that it could not be withdrawn until</l>
     <l n="224">The body was cut open where it lay .</l>
     <l n="225">And when of the Gaebulg Ferdiah heard</l>
     <l n="226">The name , he made a downward stroke of his shield ,</l>
     <l n="227">To guard his body . Then Cuchullin thrust</l>
     <l n="228">The unerring thorny spear straight o'er the rim ,</l>
     <l n="229">And through the breast-plate of his coat of mail ,</l>
     <l n="230">So that its farther half was seen beyond</l>
     <l n="231">His body , after passing through his heart .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="232">Ferdiah gave an upward stroke of his shield ,</l>
     <l n="233">His breast to cover , though it was “ the relief</l>
     <l n="234">After the danger . ” Then the servant set</l>
     <l n="235">The dread Gaebulg adown the flowing stream ;</l>
     <l n="236">Cuchullin caught it firmly ‘ twixt his toes ,</l>
     <l n="237">And from his foot a fearful cast he threw</l>
     <l n="238">Upon Ferdiah with unerring aim .</l>
     <l n="239">Swift through the well-wrought iron apron guard</l>
     <l n="240">It passed , and through the stone which was as large</l>
     <l n="241">As a huge mill-stone , cracking it in three ,</l>
     <l n="242">And so into his body , every part</l>
     <l n="243">Of which was filled with the expanding barbs</l>
     <l n="244">“ That is enough : by that one blow I fall , ”</l>
     <l n="245">Ferdiah said . “ Indeed , I now may own</l>
     <l n="246">That I am sickly after thee this day ,</l>
     <l n="247">Though it behoved not thee that I should fall</l>
     <l n="248">By stroke of thine ; ” and then these dying words</l>
     <l n="249">He added , tottering back upon the bank :</l>

   <p>32 . The name of Scatha , the Amazonian instructress of Ferdiah and Cuchullin , is still preserved in Dun Sciath , in the island of Skye , where great Cuchullin 's name and glory yet linger . The Cuchullin Mountains , named after him , “ those thunder-smitten , jagged , Cuchullin peaks of Skye , ” the grandest mountain range in Great Britain , attract to that remote island of the Hebrides many worshippers of the sublime and beautiful in nature , whose enjoyments would be largely enhanced if they knew the heroic legends which are connected with the glorious scenes they have travelled so far to witness . Cuchullin is one of the foremost characters in MacPherson 's “ Ossian , ” but the quasi-translator of Gaelic poems places him more than two centuries later than the period at which he really lived .

   <p>THE VOYAGE OF ST. BRENDAN . A. D. 545 .</p>
   <note>We are informed that Brendan , hearing of the previous voyage of his cousin , Barinthus , in the western ocean , and obtaining an account from him of the happy isles he had landed on in the far west , determined , under the strong desire of winning heathen souls to Christ , to undertake a voyage of discovery himself . And aware that all along the western coast of Ireland there were many traditions respecting the existence of a western land , he proceeded to the islands of Arran , and there remained for some time , holding communication with the venerable St. Enda , and obtaining from him much information relating to his voyage . Having prosecuted his inquiries with diligence , Brendan returned to his native Kerry ; and from a bay sheltered by the lofty mountain that is now known by his name , he set sail for the Atlantic land ; and , directing his course towards the south-west , in order to meet the summer solstice , or what we should call the tropic , after a long and rough voyage , his little bark being well provisioned , he came to summer seas , where he was carried along , without the aid of sail or oar , for many a long day . This , which it is to be presumed was the great gulf-stream , brought his vessel to shore somewhere about the Virginian capes , or where the American coast tends eastward , and forms the New England States . Here landing , he and his companions marched steadily into the interior for fifteen days , and then came to a large river , flowing from east to west : this , evidently , was the river Ohio . And this the holy adventurer was about to cross , when he was accosted by a person of noble presence — but whether a real or visionary man does not appear — who told him he had gone far enough ; that further discoveries were reserved for other men , who would , in due time , come and Christianise all that pleasant land . It is said he remained seven years away , and returned to set up a college of three thousand monks , at Clonfert .— “ Caesar Otway 's Sketches in Erris and Tyrawley , ” note , pp . 98 , 99 .</note>

    <head>THE VOCATION .</head>
    <note>When St. Brendan was an infant , says Colgan , he was placed under the care of St. Ita , and remained with her five years , after which period he was led away by Bishop Ercus in order to receive from him the more solid instruction necessary for his advancing years . Brendan always retained the greatest respect and affection for his foster-mother , and he is represented , after his seven years ’ voyage , amusing St. Ita with an account of his adventures in the ocean .</note>

     <l n="6">A. D. 1495 .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <note>Con , the son of Hugh Roe O'Donnell , with his small-powerful force ,— and the reason Con 's force was called the small-powerful force was , because he was always in the habit of mustering a force which did not exceed twelve score of well-equipped and experienced battle-axe-men , and sixty chosen active horsemen , fit for battle ,— marched with the forementioned force to the residence of MacJohn of the Glynnes ( in the county of Antrim ) ; for Con had been informed that MacJohn had in possession the finest woman , steed , and hound , of any other person in his neighbourhood . He sent a messenger for the steed before that time , and was refused , although Con had , at the same time , promised it to one of his own people . Con did not delay , and got over every difficult pass with his small-powerful force , without battle or obstruction , until he arrived in the night at the house of MacJohn , whom he , in the first place , took prisoner , and his wife , steed , and hound , and all his property , were under Con 's control , for he found the same steed , with sixteen others , in the town on that occasion . All the Glynnes were plundered on the following day by Con 's people , but he afterwards , however , made perfect restitution of all property , to whomsoever it belonged , to MacJohn 's wife , and he set her husband free to her after he had passed the Bann westward . He brought with him the steed and great booty and spoils , into Tirhugh , and ordered the cattle-prey to be let out on the pasturage .— “ Annals of the Four Masters , ” translated by Owen Connellan , Esq ., p. 331-2 . This poem , founded upon the foregoing passage ( and in which the hero acts with more generosity than the Annals warrant ) was written and published in the Dublin University Magazine before the appearance of Mr. O'Donovan ' s “ Annals of the Kingdom of Ireland , ” — the magnificent work published in 1848 by Messrs. Hodges and Smith , of this city . For Mr. O'Donovan ' s version of this passage , which differs from that of the former translator in two or three important particulars , see the second volume of his work , p. 1219 . The principal castle of the O'Donnell ' s was at Donegal . The building , of which some portions still exist , was erected in the twelfth century . The banqueting-hall , which is the scene of the opening portion of this ballad , is still preserved , and commands some beautiful views .</note>

    <head>ALL FOOL 'S DAY .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">The Sun called a beautiful Beam , that was playing</l>
     <l n="2">At the door of his golden-wall 'd palace on high ;</l>
     <l n="3">And he bade him be off , without any delaying ,</l>

     <l n="13">So he went home and dress 'd — gave his beard an elision —</l>

     <l n="15">And thus being equipped , with a postman 's precision ,</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="17">Off he posted at last , but just outside the portals</l>
     <l n="18">He lit on earth 's high-soaring bird in the dark ;</l>
     <l n="19">So he tarried a little , like many frail mortals ,</l>
     <l n="20">Who , when sent on an errand , first go on a lark ;</l>
     <l n="21">But he broke from the bird — reach 'd the cloud in a minute —</l>
     <l n="22">Gave the letter and all , as Apollo ordained ;</l>
     <l n="23">But the Sun 's correspondent , on looking within it ,</l>
     <l n="24">Found , “ Send the fool farther , ” was all it contained .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="25">The Cloud , who was up to all mystification ,</l>

     <l n="28">To spoil the least taste of the prospect of fun ;</l>
     <l n="29">So he hemm 'd , and he haw 'd — took a roll of pure vapour ,</l>
     <l n="30">Which the light from the beam made as bright as could be ,</l>
     <l n="31">( Like a sheet of the whitest cream golden-edg 'd paper ) ,</l>
     <l n="32">And wrote a few words , superscribed , “ To the Sea . ”</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="41">To Neptune the letter was brought for inspection —</l>

     <l n="44">Ere he wholly made out what the missive could mean :</l>
     <l n="45">But the date ( it was “ April the first ” ) came to save it</l>
     <l n="46">From all fear of mistake ; so he took pen in hand ,</l>
     <l n="47">And , transcribing the cruel entreaty , he gave it</l>
     <l n="48">To our travel-tired friend , and said , “ Bring it to Land . ”</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="49">To Land went the Sunbeam , which scarcely received it ,</l>
     <l n="50">When it sent it , post-haste , back again to the sea ;</l>
     <l n="51">The Sea 's hypocritical calmness deceived it ,</l>
     <l n="52">And sent it once more to the Land on the lea ;—</l>
     <l n="53">From the Land to the Lake — from the Lakes to the Fountains —</l>
     <l n="54">From the Fountains and Streams to the Hills ’ azure crest ,</l>
     <l n="55">‘ Till , at last , a tall Peak on the top of the mountains ,</l>
     <l n="56">Sent it back to the Cloud in the now golden west .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="57">He saw the whole trick by the way he was greeted</l>
     <l n="58">By the Sun 's laughing face , which all purple appears ;</l>
     <l n="59">Then , amused , yet annoyed at the way he was treated ,</l>
     <l n="60">He first laughed at the joke , and then burst into tears .</l>
     <l n="61">It is thus that this day of mistakes and surprises ,</l>
     <l n="62">When fools write on foolscap , and wear it the while ,</l>
     <l n="63">This gay saturnalia for ever arises</l>

     <l n="66">“ So leave me here , my children , with my old ways and old notions ;</l>
     <l n="67">Leave me here in peace , with my memories and devotions ;</l>
     <l n="68">Leave me in sight of your father 's grave , and as the heavens allied us ,</l>

     <l n="1">The Rain , the Rain , the beautiful Rain —</l>
     <l n="2">Welcome , welcome , it cometh again ;</l>
     <l n="3">It cometh with green to gladden the plain ,</l>
     <l n="4">And to wake the sweets in the winding lane .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">The Rain , the Rain , the beautiful Rain ,</l>
     <l n="6">It fills the flowers to their tiniest vein ,</l>
     <l n="7">Till they rise from the sod whereon they had lain —</l>
     <l n="8">Ah , me ! ah , me ! like an army slain .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">The Rain , the Rain , the beautiful Rain ,</l>
     <l n="10">Each drop is a link of a diamond chain</l>
     <l n="11">That unites the earth with its sin and its stain</l>
     <l n="12">To the radiant realm where God doth reign .</l>

     <l n="13">The Rain , the Rain , the beautiful Rain ,</l>
     <l n="14">Each drop is a tear not shed in vain ,</l>
     <l n="15">Which the angels weep for the golden grain</l>
     <l n="16">All trodden to death on the gory plain ;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="17">For Rain , the Rain , the beautiful Rain ,</l>
     <l n="18">Will waken the golden seeds again !</l>
     <l n="19">But , ah ! what power will revive the slain ,</l>
     <l n="20">Stark lying death over fair Lorraine ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="21">‘ Twere better far , O beautiful Rain ,</l>
     <l n="22">That you swelled the torrent and flooded the main ;</l>
     <l n="23">And that Winter , with all his spectral train ,</l>
     <l n="24">Alone lay camped on the icy plain .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="25">For then , O Rain , O beautiful Rain ,</l>
     <l n="26">The snow-flag of peace were unfurl 'd again ;</l>
     <l n="27">And the truce would be rung in each loud refrain</l>
     <l n="28">Of the blast replacing the bugle 's strain .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="29">Then welcome , welcome , beautiful Rain ,</l>
     <l n="30">Thou bringest flowers to the parched-up plain ;</l>
     <l n="31">Oh ! for many a frenzied heart and brain ,</l>
     <l n="32">Bring peace and love to the world again !</l>
