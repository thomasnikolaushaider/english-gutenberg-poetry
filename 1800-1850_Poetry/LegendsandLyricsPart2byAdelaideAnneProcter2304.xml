    <head>VERSE : A LEGEND OF PROVENCE</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">The lights extinguished , by the hearth I leant ,</l>
     <l n="2">Half weary with a listless discontent .</l>
     <l n="3">The flickering giant-shadows , gathering near ,</l>
     <l n="4">Closed round me with a dim and silent fear .</l>
     <l n="5">All dull , all dark ; save when the leaping flame ,</l>
     <l n="6">Glancing , lit up a Picture 's ancient frame .</l>
     <l n="7">Above the hearth it hung . Perhaps the night ,</l>
     <l n="8">My foolish tremors , or the gleaming light ,</l>
     <l n="9">Lent power to that Portrait dark and quaint —</l>
     <l n="10">A Portrait such as Rembrandt loved to paint —</l>
     <l n="11">The likeness of a Nun . I seemed to trace</l>
     <l n="12">A world of sorrow in the patient face ,</l>
     <l n="13">In the thin hands folded across her breast —</l>
     <l n="14">Its own and the room 's shadow hid the rest .</l>
     <l n="15">I gazed and dreamed , and the dull embers stirred ,</l>
     <l n="16">Till an old legend that I once had heard</l>
     <l n="17">Came back to me ; linked to the mystic gloom</l>
     <l n="18">Of that dark Picture in the ghostly room .</l>
     <l n="19">In the far south , where clustering vines are hung ;</l>
     <l n="20">Where first the old chivalric lays were sung ,</l>
     <l n="21">Where earliest smiled that gracious child of France ,</l>
     <l n="22">Angel and knight and fairy , called Romance ,</l>
     <l n="23">I stood one day . The warm blue June was spread</l>
     <l n="24">Upon the earth ; blue summer overhead ,</l>
     <l n="25">Without a cloud to fleck its radiant glare ,</l>
     <l n="26">Without a breath to stir its sultry air .</l>
     <l n="27">All still , all silent , save the sobbing rush</l>
     <l n="28">Of rippling waves , that lapsed in silver hush</l>
     <l n="29">Upon the beach ; where , glittering towards the strand ,</l>
     <l n="30">The purple Mediterranean kissed the land .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="31">All still , all peaceful ; when a convent chime</l>
     <l n="32">Broke on the mid-day silence for a time ,</l>
     <l n="33">Then trembling into quiet , seemed to cease ,</l>
     <l n="34">In deeper silence and more utter peace .</l>
     <l n="35">So as I turned to gaze , where gleaming white ,</l>
     <l n="36">Half hid by shadowy trees from passers ’ sight ,</l>
     <l n="37">The Convent lay , one who had dwelt for long</l>
     <l n="38">In that fair home of ancient tale and song ,</l>
     <l n="39">Who knew the story of each cave and hill ,</l>
     <l n="40">And every haunting fancy lingering still</l>
     <l n="41">Within the land , spake thus to me , and told</l>
     <l n="42">The Convent 's treasured Legend , quaint and old :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="43">Long years ago , a dense and flowering wood ,</l>
     <l n="44">Still more concealed where the white convent stood ,</l>
     <l n="45">Borne on its perfumed wings the title came :</l>
     <l n="46">“ Our Lady of the Hawthorns ” is its name .</l>
     <l n="47">Then did that bell , which still rings out to-day ,</l>
     <l n="48">Bid all the country rise , or eat , or pray .</l>
     <l n="49">Before that convent shrine , the haughty knight</l>
     <l n="50">Passed the lone vigil of his perilous fight ;</l>
     <l n="51">For humbler cottage strife or village brawl ,</l>
     <l n="52">The Abbess listened , prayed , and settled all .</l>
     <l n="53">Young hearts that came , weighed down by love or wrong ,</l>
     <l n="54">Left her kind presence comforted and strong .</l>
     <l n="55">Each passing pilgrim , and each beggar 's right</l>
     <l n="56">Was food , and rest , and shelter for the night .</l>
     <l n="57">But , more than this , the Nuns could well impart</l>
     <l n="58">The deepest mysteries of the healing art ;</l>
     <l n="59">Their store of herbs and simples was renowned ,</l>
     <l n="60">And held in wondering faith for miles around .</l>
     <l n="61">Thus strife , love , sorrow , good and evil fate ,</l>
     <l n="62">Found help and blessing at the convent gate .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="63">Of all the nuns , no heart was half so light ,</l>
     <l n="64">No eyelids veiling glances half as bright ,</l>
     <l n="65">No step that glided with such noiseless feet ,</l>
     <l n="66">No face that looked so tender or so sweet ,</l>
     <l n="67">No voice that rose in choir so pure , so clear ,</l>
     <l n="68">No heart to all the others half so dear ,</l>
     <l n="69">So surely touched by others ’ pain or woe ,</l>
     <l n="70">( Guessing the grief her young life could not know ,)</l>
     <l n="71">No soul in childlike faith so undefiled ,</l>
     <l n="72">As Sister Angela 's , the “ Convent Child . ”</l>
     <l n="73">For thus they loved to call her . She had known</l>
     <l n="74">No home , no love , no kindred , save their own .</l>
     <l n="75">An orphan , to their tender nursing given ,</l>
     <l n="76">Child , plaything , pupil , now the Bride of Heaven .</l>
     <l n="77">And she it was who trimmed the lamp 's red light</l>
     <l n="78">That swung before the altar , day and night ;</l>
     <l n="79">Her hands it was whose patient skill could trace</l>
     <l n="80">The finest broidery , weave the costliest lace ;</l>
     <l n="81">But most of all , her first and dearest care ,</l>
     <l n="82">The office she would never miss or share ,</l>
     <l n="83">Was every day to weave fresh garlands sweet ,</l>
     <l n="84">To place before the shrine at Mary 's feet .</l>
     <l n="85">Nature is bounteous in that region fair ,</l>
     <l n="86">For even winter has her blossoms there .</l>
     <l n="87">Thus Angela loved to count each feast the best ,</l>
     <l n="88">By telling with what flowers the shrine was dressed .</l>
     <l n="89">In pomp supreme the countless Roses passed ,</l>
     <l n="90">Battalion on battalion thronging fast ,</l>
     <l n="91">Each with a different banner , flaming bright ,</l>
     <l n="92">Damask , or striped , or crimson , pink , or white ,</l>
     <l n="93">Until they bowed before a newborn queen ,</l>
     <l n="94">And the pure virgin Lily rose serene .</l>
     <l n="95">Though Angela always thought the Mother blest</l>
     <l n="96">Must love the time of her own hawthorn best ,</l>
     <l n="97">Each evening through the year , with equal , care ,</l>
     <l n="98">She placed her flowers ; then kneeling down in prayer ,</l>
     <l n="99">As their faint perfume rose before the shrine ,</l>
     <l n="100">So rose her thoughts , as pure and as divine .</l>
     <l n="101">She knelt until the shades grew dim without ,</l>
     <l n="102">Till one by one the altar lights shone out ,</l>
     <l n="103">Till one by one the Nuns , like shadows dim ,</l>
     <l n="104">Gathered around to chant their vesper hymn ;</l>
     <l n="105">Her voice then led the music 's winged flight ,</l>
     <l n="106">And “ Ave , Maris Stella ” filled the night .</l>
     <l n="107">But wherefore linger on those days of peace ?</l>
     <l n="108">When storms draw near , then quiet hours must cease .</l>
     <l n="109">War , cruel war , defaced the land , and came</l>
     <l n="110">So near the convent with its breath of flame ,</l>
     <l n="111">That , seeking shelter , frightened peasants fled ,</l>
     <l n="112">Sobbing out tales of coming fear and dread ,</l>
     <l n="113">Till after a fierce skirmish , down the road ,</l>
     <l n="114">One night came straggling soldiers , with their load</l>
     <l n="115">Of wounded , dying comrades ; and the band ,</l>
     <l n="116">Half pleading yet as if they could command ,</l>
     <l n="117">Summoned the trembling Sisters , craved their care ,</l>
     <l n="118">Then rode away , and left the wounded there .</l>
     <l n="119">But soon compassion bade all fear depart .</l>
     <l n="120">And bidding every Sister do her part ,</l>
     <l n="121">Some prepare simples , healing salves , or bands ,</l>
     <l n="122">The Abbess chose the more experienced hands ,</l>
     <l n="123">To dress the wounds needing most skilful care ;</l>
     <l n="124">Yet even the youngest Novice took her share .</l>
     <l n="125">To Angela , who had but ready will</l>
     <l n="126">And tender pity , yet no special skill ,</l>
     <l n="127">Was given the charge of a young foreign knight ,</l>
     <l n="128">Whose wounds were painful , but whose danger slight .</l>
     <l n="129">Day after day she watched beside his bed ,</l>
     <l n="130">And first in hushed repose the hours fled :</l>
     <l n="131">His feverish moans alone the silence stirred ,</l>
     <l n="132">Or her soft voice , uttering some pious word .</l>
     <l n="133">At last the fever left him ; day by day</l>
     <l n="134">The hours , no longer silent , passed away .</l>
     <l n="135">What could she speak of ? First , to still his plaints ,</l>
     <l n="136">She told him legends of the martyred Saints ;</l>
     <l n="137">Described the pangs , which , through God 's plenteous grace ,</l>
     <l n="138">Had gained their souls so high and bright a place .</l>
     <l n="139">This pious artifice soon found success —</l>
     <l n="140">Or so she fancied — for he murmured less .</l>
     <l n="141">So she described the glorious pomp sublime ,</l>
     <l n="142">In which the chapel shone at Easter time ,</l>
     <l n="143">The Banners , Vestments , gold , and colours bright ,</l>
     <l n="144">Counted how many tapers gave their light ;</l>
     <l n="145">Then , in minute detail went on to say ,</l>
     <l n="146">How the High Altar looked on Christmas-day :</l>
     <l n="147">The kings and shepherds , all in green and red ,</l>
     <l n="148">And a bright star of jewels overhead .</l>
     <l n="149">Then told the sign by which they all had seen ,</l>
     <l n="150">How even nature loved to greet her Queen ,</l>
     <l n="151">For , when Our Lady 's last procession went</l>
     <l n="152">Down the long garden , every head was bent ,</l>
     <l n="153">And , rosary in hand , each Sister prayed ;</l>
     <l n="154">As the long floating banners were displayed ,</l>
     <l n="155">They struck the hawthorn boughs , and showers and showers</l>
     <l n="156">Of buds and blossoms strewed her way with flowers .</l>
     <l n="157">The Knight unwearied listened ; till at last ,</l>
     <l n="158">He too described the glories of his past ;</l>
     <l n="159">Tourney , and joust , and pageant bright and fair ,</l>
     <l n="160">And all the lovely ladies who were there .</l>
     <l n="161">But half incredulous she heard . Could this —</l>
     <l n="162">This be the world ? this place of love and bliss !</l>
     <l n="163">Where then was hid the strange and hideous charm ,</l>
     <l n="164">That never failed to bring the gazer harm ?</l>
     <l n="165">She crossed herself , yet asked , and listened still ,</l>
     <l n="166">And still the knight described with all his skill</l>
     <l n="167">The glorious world of joy , all joys above ,</l>
     <l n="168">Transfigured in the golden mist of love .</l>
     <l n="169">Spread , spread your wings , ye angel guardians bright ,</l>
     <l n="170">And shield these dazzling phantoms from her sight !</l>
     <l n="171">But no ; days passed , matins and vespers rang ,</l>
     <l n="172">And still the quiet Nuns toiled , prayed , and sang ,</l>
     <l n="173">And never guessed the fatal , coiling net</l>
     <l n="174">Which every day drew near , and nearer yet ,</l>
     <l n="175">Around their darling ; for she went and came</l>
     <l n="176">About her duties , outwardly the same .</l>
     <l n="177">The same ? ah , no ! even when she knelt to pray ,</l>
     <l n="178">Some charmed dream kept all her heart away .</l>
     <l n="179">So days went on , until the convent gate</l>
     <l n="180">Opened one night . Who durst go forth so late ?</l>
     <l n="181">Across the moonlit grass , with stealthy tread ,</l>
     <l n="182">Two silent , shrouded figures passed and fled .</l>
     <l n="183">And all was silent , save the moaning seas ,</l>
     <l n="184">That sobbed and pleaded , and a wailing breeze</l>
     <l n="185">That sighed among the perfumed hawthorn trees .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="186">What need to tell that dream so bright and brief ,</l>
     <l n="187">Of joy unchequered by a dread of grief ?</l>
     <l n="188">What need to tell how all such dreams must fade ,</l>
     <l n="189">Before the slow , foreboding , dreaded shade ,</l>
     <l n="190">That floated nearer , until pomp and pride ,</l>
     <l n="191">Pleasure and wealth , were summoned to her side .</l>
     <l n="192">To bid , at least , the noisy hours forget ,</l>
     <l n="193">And clamour down the whispers of regret .</l>
     <l n="194">Still Angela strove to dream , and strove in vain ;</l>
     <l n="195">Awakened once , she could not sleep again .</l>
     <l n="196">She saw , each day and hour , more worthless grown</l>
     <l n="197">The heart for which she cast away her own ;</l>
     <l n="198">And her soul learnt , through bitterest inward strife ,</l>
     <l n="199">The slight , frail love for which she wrecked her life ,</l>
     <l n="200">The phantom for which all her hope was given ,</l>
     <l n="201">The cold bleak earth for which she bartered heaven !</l>
     <l n="202">But all in vain ; would even the tenderest heart</l>
     <l n="203">Now stoop to take so poor an outcast 's part ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="204">Years fled , and she grew reckless more and more ,</l>
     <l n="205">Until the humblest peasant closed his door ,</l>
     <l n="206">And where she passed , fair dames , in scorn and pride ,</l>
     <l n="207">Shuddered , and drew their rustling robes aside .</l>
     <l n="208">At last a yearning seemed to fill her soul ,</l>
     <l n="209">A longing that was stronger than control :</l>
     <l n="210">Once more , just once again , to see the place</l>
     <l n="211">That knew her young and innocent ; to retrace</l>
     <l n="212">The long and weary southern path ; to gaze</l>
     <l n="213">Upon the haven of her childish days ;</l>
     <l n="214">Once more beneath the convent roof to lie ;</l>
     <l n="215">Once more to look upon her home — and die !</l>
     <l n="216">Weary and worn — her comrades , chill remorse</l>
     <l n="217">And black despair , yet a strange silent force</l>
     <l n="218">Within her heart , that drew her more and more —</l>
     <l n="219">Onward she crawled , and begged from door to door .</l>
     <l n="220">Weighed down with weary days , her failing strength</l>
     <l n="221">Grew less each hour , till one day 's dawn at length ,</l>
     <l n="222">As first its rays flooded the world with light ,</l>
     <l n="223">Showed the broad waters , glittering blue and bright ,</l>
     <l n="224">And where , amid the leafy hawthorn wood ,</l>
     <l n="225">Just as of old the quiet cloister stood .</l>
     <l n="226">Would any know her ? Nay , no fear . Her face</l>
     <l n="227">Had lost all trace of youth , of joy , of grace ,</l>
     <l n="228">Of the pure happy soul they used to know —</l>
     <l n="229">The novice Angela — so long ago .</l>
     <l n="230">She rang the convent bell . The well-known sound</l>
     <l n="231">Smote on her heart , and bowed her to the ground ,</l>
     <l n="232">And she , who had not wept for long dry years ,</l>
     <l n="233">Felt the strange rush of unaccustomed tears ;</l>
     <l n="234">Terror and anguish seemed to check her breath ,</l>
     <l n="235">And stop her heart . Oh God ! could this be death ?</l>
     <l n="236">Crouching against the iron gate , she laid</l>
     <l n="237">Her weary head against the bars , and prayed :</l>
     <l n="238">But nearer footsteps drew , then seemed to wait :</l>
     <l n="239">And then she heard the opening of the grate ,</l>
     <l n="240">And saw the withered face , on which awoke</l>
     <l n="241">Pity and sorrow , as the portress spoke ,</l>
     <l n="242">And asked the stranger 's bidding : “ Take me in , ”</l>
     <l n="243">She faltered , “ Sister Monica , from sin ,</l>
     <l n="244">And sorrow , and despair , that will not cease ;</l>
     <l n="245">Oh , take me in , and let me die in peace ! ”</l>
     <l n="246">With soothing words the Sister bade her wait ,</l>
     <l n="247">Until she brought the key to unbar the gate .</l>
     <l n="248">The beggar tried to thank her as she lay ,</l>
     <l n="249">And heard the echoing footsteps die away .</l>
     <l n="250">But what soft voice was that which sounded near ,</l>
     <l n="251">And stirred strange trouble in her heart to hear ?</l>
     <l n="252">She raised her head ; she saw — she seemed to know —</l>
     <l n="253">A face that came from long , long years ago :</l>
     <l n="254">Herself ; yet not as when she fled away ,</l>
     <l n="255">The young and blooming novice , fair and gay ,</l>
     <l n="256">But a grave woman , gentle and serene :</l>
     <l n="257">The outcast knew it — what she might have been .</l>
     <l n="258">But , as she gazed and gazed , a radiance bright</l>
     <l n="259">Filled all the place with strange and sudden light ;</l>
     <l n="260">The Nun was there no longer , but instead ,</l>
     <l n="261">A figure with a circle round its head ,</l>
     <l n="262">A ring of glory ; and a face , so meek ,</l>
     <l n="263">So soft , so tender . . . Angela strove to speak ,</l>
     <l n="264">And stretched her hands out , crying , “ Mary mild ,</l>
     <l n="265">Mother of mercy , help me !— help your child ! ”</l>
     <l n="266">And Mary answered , “ From thy bitter past ,</l>
     <l n="267">Welcome , my child ! oh , welcome home at last !</l>
     <l n="268">I filled thy place . Thy flight is known to none ,</l>
     <l n="269">For all thy daily duties I have done ;</l>
     <l n="270">Gathered thy flowers , and prayed , and sung , and slept ;</l>
     <l n="271">Didst thou not know , poor child , thy place was kept ?</l>
     <l n="272">Kind hearts are here ; yet would the tenderest one</l>
     <l n="273">Have limits to its mercy : God has none .</l>
     <l n="274">And man 's forgiveness may be true and sweet ,</l>
     <l n="275">But yet he stoops to give it . More complete</l>
     <l n="276">Is Love that lays forgiveness at thy feet ,</l>
     <l n="277">And pleads with thee to raise it . Only Heaven</l>
     <l n="278">Means crowned , not vanquished , when it says ‘ Forgiven ! ’ ”</l>
     <l n="279">Back hurried Sister Monica ; but where</l>
     <l n="280">Was the poor beggar she left lying there ?</l>
     <l n="281">Gone ; and she searched in vain , and sought the place</l>
     <l n="282">For that wan woman with the piteous face :</l>
     <l n="283">But only Angela at the gateway stood ,</l>
     <l n="284">Laden with hawthorn blossoms from the wood .</l>
     <l n="285">And never did a day pass by again ,</l>
     <l n="286">But the old portress , with a sigh of pain ,</l>
     <l n="287">Would sorrow for her loitering : with a prayer</l>
     <l n="288">That the poor beggar , in her wild despair ,</l>
     <l n="289">Might not have come to any ill ; and when</l>
     <l n="290">She ended , “ God forgive her ! ” humbly then</l>
     <l n="291">Did Angela bow her head , and say “ Amen ! ”</l>
     <l n="292">How pitiful her heart was ! all could trace</l>
     <l n="293">Something that dimmed the brightness of her face</l>
     <l n="294">After that day , which none had seen before ;</l>
     <l n="295">Not trouble — but a shadow — nothing more .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="296">Years passed away . Then , one dark day of dread</l>
     <l n="297">Saw all the sisters kneeling round a bed ,</l>
     <l n="298">Where Angela lay dying ; every breath</l>
     <l n="299">Struggling beneath the heavy hand of death .</l>
     <l n="300">But suddenly a flush lit up her cheek ,</l>
     <l n="301">She raised her wan right hand , and strove to speak .</l>
     <l n="302">In sorrowing love they listened ; not a sound</l>
     <l n="303">Or sigh disturbed the utter silence round .</l>
     <l n="304">The very tapers ’ flames were scarcely stirred ,</l>
     <l n="305">In such hushed awe the sisters knelt and heard .</l>
     <l n="306">And through that silence Angela told her life :</l>
     <l n="307">Her sin , her flight ; the sorrow and the strife ,</l>
     <l n="308">And the return ; and then clear , low and calm ,</l>
     <l n="309">“ Praise God for me , my sisters ; ” and the psalm</l>
     <l n="310">Rang up to heaven , far and clear and wide ,</l>
     <l n="311">Again and yet again , then sank and died ;</l>
     <l n="312">While her white face had such a smile of peace ,</l>
     <l n="313">They saw she never heard the music cease ;</l>
     <l n="314">And weeping sisters laid her in her tomb ,</l>
     <l n="315">Crowned with a wreath of perfumed hawthorn bloom .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="316">And thus the Legend ended . It may be</l>

     <l n="319">Never enough believed , or asked , or known .</l>

     <l n="325">We lost it in this daily jar and fret ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">It was midnight when I listened ,</l>
     <l n="2">And I heard two Voices speak ;</l>
     <l n="3">One was harsh , and stern , and cruel ,</l>
     <l n="4">And the other soft and weak :</l>
     <l n="5">Yet I saw no Vision enter ,</l>
     <l n="6">And I heard no steps depart ,</l>
     <l n="7">Of this Tyrant and his Captive , . . .</l>
     <l n="8">Fate it might be and a Heart .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">Thus the stern Voice spake in triumph : -</l>
     <l n="10">“ I have shut your life away</l>
     <l n="11">From the radiant world of nature ,</l>
     <l n="12">And the perfumed light of day .</l>
     <l n="13">You , who loved to steep your spirit</l>
     <l n="14">In the charm of Earth 's delight ,</l>
     <l n="15">See no glory of the daytime ,</l>
     <l n="16">And no sweetness of the night . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="17">But the soft Voice answered calmly :</l>
     <l n="18">“ Nay , for when the March winds bring</l>
     <l n="19">Just a whisper to my window ,</l>
     <l n="20">I can dream the rest of Spring ;</l>
     <l n="21">And to-day I saw a Swallow</l>
     <l n="22">Flitting past my prison bars ,</l>
     <l n="23">And my cell has just one corner</l>
     <l n="24">Whence at night I see the stars . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="25">But its bitter taunt repeating ,</l>
     <l n="26">Cried the harsh Voice :— “ Where are they —</l>
     <l n="27">All the friends of former hours ,</l>
     <l n="28">Who forget your name to-day ?</l>
     <l n="29">All the links of love are shattered ,</l>
     <l n="30">Which you thought so strong before ;</l>
     <l n="31">And your very heart is lonely ,</l>
     <l n="32">And alone since loved no more . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="33">But the low Voice spoke still lower :—</l>
     <l n="34">“ Nay , I know the golden chain</l>
     <l n="35">Of my love is purer , stronger ,</l>
     <l n="36">For the cruel fire of pain :</l>
     <l n="37">They remember me no longer ,</l>
     <l n="38">But I , grieving here alone ,</l>
     <l n="39">Bind their souls to me for ever</l>
     <l n="40">By the love within their own . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="41">But the Voice cried : -  “ Once remember</l>
     <l n="42">You devoted soul and mind</l>
     <l n="43">To the welfare of your brethren ,</l>
     <l n="44">And the service of your kind .</l>
     <l n="45">Now , what sorrow can you comfort ?</l>
     <l n="46">You , who lie in helpless pain ,</l>
     <l n="47">With an impotent compassion</l>
     <l n="48">Fretting out your life in vain . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="49">“ Nay ; ” and then the gentle answer</l>
     <l n="50">Rose more loud , and full , and clear :</l>
     <l n="51">“ For the sake of all my brethren</l>
     <l n="52">I thank God that I am here !</l>
     <l n="53">Poor had been my Life 's best efforts ,</l>
     <l n="54">Now I waste no thought or breath —</l>
     <l n="55">For the prayer of those who suffer</l>
     <l n="56">Has the strength of Love and Death . ”</l>
