     <item>Prima dicta mihi , summa dicenda Camena .</item>
     <item>The years will pass , and hearts will range , YOU conquer Time , and Care , and Change . Though Time doth still delight to shed The dust on many a younger head ; Though Care , oft coming , hath the guile From younger lips to steal the smile ; Though Change makes younger hearts wax cold , And sells new loves for loves of old , Time , Change , nor Care , hath learned the art To fleck your hair , to chill your heart , To touch your tresses with the snow , To mar your mirth of long ago . Change , Care , nor Time , while life endure , Shall spoil our ancient friendship sure , The love which flows from sacred springs , In ‘ old unhappy far-off things , ’ From sympathies in grief and joy , Through all the years of man and boy .</item>
     <item>Therefore , to you , the rhymes I strung When even this ‘ brindled ’ head was young I bring , and later rhymes I bring That flit upon as weak a wing , But still for you , for yours , they sing !</item>

    <docImprint>Many of the verses and translations in this volume were published first in Ballads and Lyrics of Old<country>France</country>(<date>1872</date>) . Though very sensible that they have the demerits of imitative and even of undergraduate rhyme , I print them again because people I like have liked them . The rest are of different dates , and lack ( though doubtless they need ) the excuse of having been written , like some of the earlier pieces , during College Lectures . I would gladly have added to this volume what other more or less serious rhymes I have written , but circumstances over which I have no control have bound them up with Ballades , and other toys of that sort . It may be as well to repeat in prose , what has already been said in verse , that Grass of Parnassus , the pretty Autumn flower , grows in the marshes at the foot of the Muses ’ Hill , and other hills , not at the top by any means . Several of the versions from the Greek Anthology have been published in the Fortnightly Review , and the sonnet on Colonel Burnaby appeared in Punch . These , with pieces from other serials , are reprinted by the courteous permission of the Editors . The verses that were published in Ballades and Lyrics , and in Ballads and Verses Vain ( Charles Scribner 's Sons ,<settlement>New York</settlement>) , are marked in the contents with an asterisk .</docImprint>
    <docTitle><titlePart>GRASS OF PARNASSUS . Pale star that by the lochs of Galloway , In wet green places ‘ twixt the depth and height Dost keep thine hour while Autumn ebbs away , When now the moors have doffed the heather bright , Grass of Parnassus , flower of my delight , How gladly with the unpermitted bay — Garlands not mine , and leaves that not decay — How gladly would I twine thee if I might ! The bays are out of reach ! But far below The peaks forbidden of the Muses ’ Hill , Grass of Parnassus , thy returning snow Between September and October chill Doth speak to me of Autumns long ago , And these kind faces that are with me still .</titlePart></docTitle>

      <head>A LOST PATH .</head>
      <head>Plotinus , the Greek philosopher , had a certain proper mode of ecstasy , whereby , as Porphyry saith , his soul , becoming free from the deathly flesh , was made one with the Spirit that is in the world .</head>
       <l n="1">Alas , the path is lost , we cannot leave</l>
       <l n="2">Our bright , our clouded life , and pass away</l>
       <l n="3">As through strewn clouds , that stain the quiet eve ,</l>
       <l n="4">To heights remoter of the purer day .</l>
       <l n="5">The soul may not , returning whence she came ,</l>
       <l n="6">Bathe herself deep in Being , and forget</l>
       <l n="7">The joys that fever , and the cares that fret ,</l>
       <l n="8">Made once more one with the eternal flame</l>
       <l n="9">That breathes in all things ever more the same .</l>
       <l n="10">She would be young again , thus drinking deep</l>
       <l n="11">Of her old life ; and this has been , men say ,</l>
       <l n="12">But this we know not , who have only sleep</l>
       <l n="13">To soothe us , sleep more terrible than day ,</l>
       <l n="14">Where dead delights , and fair lost faces stray ,</l>
       <l n="15">To make us weary at our wakening ;</l>
       <l n="16">And of that long lost path to the Divine</l>
       <l n="17">We dream , as some Greek shepherd erst might sing ,</l>
       <l n="18">Half credulous , of easy Proserpine ,</l>

       <l n="2">The Sirens once were maidens innocent</l>

       <l n="18">With woven dances in the poplar-shade ,</l>
       <l n="19">And all her song was but of lady 's bowers</l>
       <l n="20">And the returning swallows , and spring flowers ,</l>
       <l n="21">Till forth to seek a shadow-queen she strayed ,</l>
       <l n="22">A shadowy land ; and now hath overweighed</l>
       <l n="23">Her singing chaplet with the snow and showers .</l>
       <l n="24">Yes , fair well-water for the bitter brine</l>
       <l n="25">She left , and by the margin of life 's sea</l>
       <l n="26">Sings , and her song is full of the sea 's moan ,</l>
       <l n="27">And wild with dread , and love of Proserpine ;</l>
       <l n="28">And whoso once has listened to her , he</l>
       <l n="29">His whole life long is slave to her alone .</l>
