     <l n="2">All alone in the field</l>
     <l n="3">Stands John S. Crow ;</l>
     <l n="4">And a curious sight is he ,</l>
     <l n="5">With his head of tow ,</l>
     <l n="6">And a hat pulled low</l>
     <l n="7">On a face that you never see .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="8">His clothes are ragged</l>
     <l n="9">And horrid and old ,</l>
     <l n="10">The worst that ever were worn ;</l>
     <l n="11">They 're covered with mold ,</l>
     <l n="12">And in each fold</l>
     <l n="13">A terrible rent is torn .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="14">They once were new</l>
     <l n="15">And spick and span ,</l>
     <l n="16">As nice as clothes could be ;</l>
     <l n="17">For though John hardly can</l>
     <l n="18">Be called a man ,</l>
     <l n="19">They were made for men you see .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="20">That old blue coat ,</l>
     <l n="21">With a double breast</l>
     <l n="22">And a brass button here and there ,</l>
     <l n="23">Was grandfather 's best ,</l>
     <l n="24">And matches the vest —</l>
     <l n="25">The one Uncle Phil used to wear .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="26">The trousers are short ;</l>
     <l n="27">They belonged to Bob</l>
     <l n="28">Before he had got his growth ;</l>
     <l n="29">But John 's no snob ,</l>
     <l n="30">And , unlike Bob ,</l>
     <l n="31">Cuts his legs to the length of his cloth .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="32">The boots are a mystery :</l>
     <l n="33">How and where</l>
     <l n="34">John got such a shabby lot ,</l>
     <l n="35">Such a shocking pair ,</l>
     <l n="36">I do declare</l>
     <l n="37">Though he may know , I do not .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="38">But the hat that he wears</l>
     <l n="39">Is the worst of all ;</l>
     <l n="40">I wonder that John keeps it on .</l>
     <l n="41">It once was tall ,</l>
     <l n="42">But now it is small —</l>
     <l n="43">Like a closed accordeon .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="44">But a steady old chap</l>
     <l n="45">Is John S. Crow ,</l>
     <l n="46">And for months has stood at his post ;</l>
     <l n="47">For corn you know</l>
     <l n="48">Takes time to grow ,</l>
     <l n="49">And ‘ tis long between seed and roast .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="50">And it had to be watched</l>
     <l n="51">And guarded with care</l>
     <l n="52">From the time it was put in the ground ,</l>
     <l n="53">For over there ,</l>
     <l n="54">And everywhere ,</l>
     <l n="55">Sad thieves were waiting around .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="56">Sad thieves in black ,</l>
     <l n="57">A cowardly set ,</l>
     <l n="58">Who waited for John to be gone ,</l>
     <l n="59">That they might get</l>
     <l n="60">A chance to upset</l>
     <l n="61">The plans of the planter of corn .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="62">They were no kin to John ,</l>
     <l n="63">Though they bore his name</l>
     <l n="64">And belonged to the family Crow ;</l>
     <l n="65">He 'd scorn to claim</l>
     <l n="66">Any part of the fame</l>
     <l n="67">That is theirs wherever you go .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="68">So he has stuck to the field</l>
     <l n="69">And watched the corn ,</l>
     <l n="70">And been watched by the crows from the hill ;</l>
     <l n="71">Till at length they 're gone ,</l>
     <l n="72">And so is the corn —</l>
     <l n="73">They away , and it to the mill .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="74">Now the work is done ,</l>
     <l n="75">And it 's time for play ,</l>
     <l n="76">For which John is glad I know ;</l>
     <l n="77">For though made of hay ,</l>
     <l n="78">If he could he would say ,</l>
     <l n="79">“ It 's stupid to be a scarecrow . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="80">But though it is stupid ,</l>
     <l n="81">And though it is slow ,</l>
     <l n="82">To fill such an humble position ;</l>
     <l n="83">To be a good scarecrow</l>
     <l n="84">Is better I know</l>
     <l n="85">Than to scorn a lowly condition .</l>

     <l n="2">A lazy and careless boy was Jack ,—</l>
     <l n="3">He would not work , and he would not play ;</l>
     <l n="4">And so poor , that the jacket on his back</l>
     <l n="5">Hung in a ragged fringe alway ;</l>
     <l n="6">But ‘ twas shilly-shally , dilly-dally ,</l>
     <l n="7">From day to day .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="8">At last his mother was almost wild ,</l>
     <l n="9">And to get them food she knew not how ;</l>
     <l n="10">And she told her good-for-nothing child</l>
     <l n="11">To drive to market the brindle cow .</l>
     <l n="12">So he strolled along , with whistle and song ,</l>
     <l n="13">And drove the cow .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="14">A man was under the wayside trees ,</l>
     <l n="15">Who carried some beans in his hand — all white .</l>
     <l n="16">He said , “ My boy , I 'll give you these</l>
     <l n="17">For the brindle cow . ” Jack said , “ All right . ”</l>
     <l n="18">And , without any gold for the cow he had sold ,</l>
     <l n="19">Went home at night .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="20">Bitter tears did the mother weep ;</l>
     <l n="21">Out of the window the beans were thrown ,</l>
     <l n="22">And Jack went supperless to sleep ;</l>
     <l n="23">But , when the morning sunlight shone ,</l>
     <l n="24">High , and high , to the very sky ,</l>
     <l n="25">The beans had grown .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="26">They made a ladder all green and bright ,</l>
     <l n="27">They twined and crossed and twisted so ;</l>
     <l n="28">And Jack sprang up it with all his might ,</l>
     <l n="29">And called to his mother down below :</l>
     <l n="30">“ Hitchity-hatchet , my little red jacket ,</l>
     <l n="31">And up I go ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="32">High as a tree , then high as a steeple ,</l>
     <l n="33">Then high as a kite , and high as the moon ,</l>
     <l n="34">Far out of sight of cities and people ,</l>
     <l n="35">He toiled and tugged and climbed till noon ;</l>
     <l n="36">And began to pant : “ I guess I sha n't</l>
     <l n="37">Get down very soon ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="38">At last he came to a path that led</l>
     <l n="39">To a house he had never seen before ;</l>
     <l n="40">And he begged of a woman there some bread ;</l>
     <l n="41">But she heard her husband , the Giant , roar ,</l>
     <l n="42">And she gave him a shove in the old brick oven ,</l>
     <l n="43">And shut the door .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="44">And the Giant sniffed , and beat his breast ,</l>
     <l n="45">And grumbled low , “ Fe , fi , fo , fum ! ”</l>
     <l n="46">His poor wife prayed he would sit and rest ,—</l>
     <l n="47">“ I smell fresh meat ! I will have some ! ”</l>
     <l n="48">He cried the louder , “ Fe , fi , fo , fum !</l>
     <l n="49">I will have some . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="50">He ate as much as would feed ten men ,</l>
     <l n="51">And drank a barrel of beer to the dregs ;</l>
     <l n="52">Then he called for his little favorite hen ,</l>
     <l n="53">As under the table he stretched his legs ,—</l>
     <l n="54">And he roared “ Ho ! ho ! ” — like a buffalo —</l>
     <l n="55">“ Lay your gold eggs ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="56">She laid a beautiful egg of gold ;</l>
     <l n="57">And at last the Giant began to snore ;</l>
     <l n="58">Jack waited a minute , then , growing bold ,</l>
     <l n="59">He crept from the oven along the floor ,</l>
     <l n="60">And caught the hen in his arms , and then</l>
     <l n="61">Fled through the door .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="62">But the Giant heard him leave the house ,</l>
     <l n="63">And followed him out , and bellowed “ Oh-oh ! ”</l>
     <l n="64">But Jack was as nimble as a mouse ,</l>
     <l n="65">And sang as he rapidly slipped below :</l>
     <l n="66">“ Hitchity-hatchet , my little red jacket ,</l>
     <l n="67">And down I go ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="68">And the Giant howled , and gnashed his teeth .</l>
     <l n="69">Jack got down first , and , in a flash ,</l>
     <l n="70">Cut the ladder from underneath ;</l>
     <l n="71">And Giant and Bean-stalk , in one dash ,—</l>
     <l n="72">No shilly-shally , no dilly-dally ,—</l>
     <l n="73">Fell with a crash .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="74">This brought Jack fame , and riches , too ;</l>
     <l n="75">For the little gold-egg hen would lay</l>
     <l n="76">An egg whenever he told her to ,</l>
     <l n="77">If he asked one fifty times a day .</l>
     <l n="78">And he and his mother lived with each other</l>
     <l n="79">In peace alway .</l>

     <l n="2">Little Dame Spider had finished her spinning ,</l>
     <l n="3">Just as the warm summer day was beginning ,</l>
     <l n="4">And the white threads of her beautiful curtain</l>
     <l n="5">Tied she and glued she to make them more certain .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="6">Dressed in her old-fashioned feathers and fringes ,</l>
     <l n="7">Then she sat down to wait ; on silken hinges</l>
     <l n="8">Swung the light fleece with a moonshiny glisten ;</l>
     <l n="9">Nothing for her but to watch and to listen .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="10">Presently , going off early to labor ,—</l>
     <l n="11">Bowing politely , as neighbor to neighbor ,</l>
     <l n="12">When he caught sight of this little old woman ,—</l>
     <l n="13">Sailed by a honey-bee , serge-clad and common .</l>

     <l n="14">“ Are you so scornful because I am humble ?</l>

     <l n="16">Pause in their flying to chat for an hour ! ”</l>
     <l n="17">She called out after him , half gay , half sour .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="18">“ O , no , ” he cried . “ I am off to discover</l>
     <l n="19">What I can find fresh in the way of white clover ;</l>
     <l n="20">But since your window is cosy and shady ,</l>
     <l n="21">I will sit down half a minute , dear Lady . ”</l>

     <l n="22">Little Dame Spider arose with a rustle ,</l>
     <l n="23">Welcomed him with ceremonious bustle ;</l>
     <l n="24">Quick as a flash threw her long arms around him ,</l>
     <l n="25">Heeded no buzzing , but held him and bound him ;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="26">Tied knots so tight that he could not undo them ;</l>
     <l n="27">Wove snares so strong that he could not break through them ;</l>
     <l n="28">Then , with a relish , stood chuckling and grinning ,</l>
     <l n="29">“ This is to pay me for my early spinning ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="30">At the home-hive the bees going and coming</l>
     <l n="31">Kept up all day their industrious humming ,</l>

     <l n="33">That Madame Spider had dined off their brother .</l>

     <l n="2">A Wee , wee woman</l>

     <l n="5">In a wee , wee room ,</l>
     <l n="6">And early every morning ,</l>
     <l n="7">So tidy was her habit ,</l>

     <l n="10">To sweep for the cinders ,</l>

     <l n="14">When , odd enough , one day</l>
     <l n="15">She found a silver penny ,</l>

     <l n="18">She eyed it , she took it</l>

     <l n="27">The kid proved very lazy !</l>

     <l n="29">She could scarcely see it crawl ;</l>
     <l n="30">At first she coaxed and petted it ,</l>
     <l n="31">And then she stormed and scolded ,</l>

     <l n="33">It would not go at all .</l>
    </lg>

     <l n="34">Just then Dame Fidget saw a dog run by ,</l>

     <l n="50">But the stick did n't stir ,</l>

     <l n="46">And went up to him very politely ,</l>

     <l n="49">You 're the son of my brother who died —</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Once on a time there was a man so hideous and ugly</l>
     <l n="2">That little children shrank and tried to hide when he appeared ;</l>
     <l n="3">His eyes were fierce and prominent , his long hair stiff like bristles ,</l>
     <l n="4">His stature was enormous , and he wore a long blue beard —</l>
     <l n="5">He took his name from that through all the country round about him ,—</l>
     <l n="6">And whispered tales of dreadful deeds but helped to make him feared .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="7">Yet he was rich , O ! very rich ; his home was in a castle ,</l>
     <l n="8">Whose turrets darkened on the sky , so grand and black and bold</l>
     <l n="9">That like a thunder-cloud it looked upon the blue horizon .</l>
     <l n="10">He had fertile lands and parks and towns</l>
     <l n="11">and hunting-grounds and gold ,</l>
     <l n="12">And tapestries a queen might covet , statues , pictures , jewels ,</l>
     <l n="13">While his servants numbered hundreds ,</l>
     <l n="14">and his wines were rare and old .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="15">Now near to this old Blue-beard 's castle lived a lady neighbor ,</l>
     <l n="16">Who had two daughters , beautiful as lilies on a stem ;</l>
     <l n="17">And he asked that one of them be given him in marriage —</l>
     <l n="18">He did not care which one it was , but left the choice to them .</l>
     <l n="19">But , oh , the terror that they felt , their efforts to evade him ,</l>
     <l n="20">With careless art , with coquetry , with wile and stratagem !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="21">He saw their high young spirits scorned him , yet he meant to conquer .</l>
     <l n="22">He planned a visit for them ,— or , ‘ twas rather one long fête ;</l>
     <l n="23">And to charming guests and lovely feasts , to music and to dancing ,</l>
     <l n="24">Swung wide upon its hinges grim the gloomy castle gate .</l>
     <l n="25">And , sure enough , before a week was ended , blinded , dazzled ,</l>
     <l n="26">The youngest maiden whispered “ yes , ” and yielded to her fate .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="27">And so she wedded Blue-beard — like a wise and wily spider</l>
     <l n="28">He had lured into his web the wished-for , silly little fly !</l>
     <l n="29">And , before the honeymoon was gone , one day he stood beside her ,</l>
     <l n="30">And with oily words of sorrow , but with evil in his eye ,</l>
     <l n="31">Said his business for a month or more would call him to a distance ,</l>
     <l n="32">And he must leave her — sorry to — but then , she must not cry !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="33">He bade her have her friends , as many as she liked , about her ,</l>
     <l n="34">And handed her a jingling bunch of something , saying , “ These</l>
     <l n="35">Will open vaults and cellars and the heavy iron boxes</l>
     <l n="36">Where all my gold and jewels are , or any door you please .</l>
     <l n="37">Go where you like , do what you will , one single thing excepted ! ”</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="39">“ This will unlock the closet at the end of the long passage ,</l>

     <l n="41">So she promised that she would not , and he went upon his journey .</l>
     <l n="42">And no sooner was he gone than all her merry friends around</l>
     <l n="43">Came to visit her , and made the dim old corridors and chambers</l>
     <l n="44">With their silken dresses whisper , with laugh and song resound .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="45">Up and down the oaken stairways flitted dainty-footed ladies ,</l>
     <l n="46">Lighting up the shadowy twilight with the lustre of their bloom ;</l>
     <l n="47">Like the varied sunlight streaming through an old cathedral window</l>
     <l n="48">Went their brightness glancing through the unaccustomed gloom ,</l>
     <l n="49">But Blue-beard 's wife was restless , and a strong desire possessed her</l>
     <l n="50">Through it all to get a single peep at that forbidden room .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="51">And so one day she slipped away from all her guests , unnoted ,</l>
     <l n="52">Down through the lower passage , till she reached the fatal door ,</l>
     <l n="53">Put in the key and turned the lock , and gently pushed it open —</l>
     <l n="54">But , oh the horrid sight that met her eyes ! Upon the floor</l>
     <l n="55">There were blood-stains dark and dreadful ,</l>
     <l n="56">and like dresses in a wardrobe ,</l>
     <l n="57">There were women hung up by their hair , and dripping in their gore !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="58">Then , at once , upon her mind the unknown fate that had befallen</l>
     <l n="59">The other wives of Blue-beard flashed — ‘ twas now no mystery !</l>
     <l n="60">She started back as cold as icicles , as white as ashes ,</l>
     <l n="61">And upon the clammy floor her trembling fingers dropped the key .</l>
     <l n="62">She caught it up , she whirled the bolt to , shut the sight behind her ,</l>
     <l n="63">And like a startled deer at sound of hunter 's gun , fled she !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="64">She reached her room with gasping breath ,— behold , another terror !</l>
     <l n="65">Upon the key within her hand ; she saw a ghastly stain ;</l>
     <l n="66">She rubbed it with her handkerchief , she washed in soap and water ,</l>
     <l n="67">She scoured it with sand and stone , but all was done in vain !</l>
     <l n="68">For when one side , by dint of work , grew bright , upon the other</l>
     <l n="69">( It was bewitched , you know ,) came out that ugly spot again !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="70">And then , unlooked-for , who should come</l>
     <l n="71">next morning , bright and early ,</l>
     <l n="72">But old Blue-beard himself who had n't been away a week !</l>
     <l n="73">He kissed his wife , and , after a brief pause , said , smiling blandly :</l>
     <l n="74">“ I 'd like my keys , my dear . ” He saw a tear upon her cheek ,</l>
     <l n="75">And guessed the truth . She gave him all</l>
     <l n="76">but one . He scowled and grumbled :</l>
     <l n="77">“ I want the key to the small room ! ”</l>
     <l n="78">Poor thing , she could not speak !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="79">He saw at once the stain it bore while she turned pale and paler ,</l>

     <l n="81">Prepare yourself to die at once ! ” he cried . The frightened lady</l>
     <l n="82">Could only fall before him pleading : “ Give me time to pray ! ”</l>
     <l n="83">Just fifteen minutes by the clock he granted . To her chamber</l>

     <l n="88">And Anne went flying like a bird up to the tower high .</l>
     <l n="89">“ Oh , Anne , sister Anne , do you see anybody coming ? ”</l>
     <l n="90">Called the praying lady up the tower-stairs with piteous cry .</l>

     <l n="93">Meanwhile old Blue-beard down below was whetting up his cutlass ,</l>
     <l n="94">And shouting : “ Come down quick , or I 'll come after you , my lass ! ”</l>
     <l n="95">“ One little minute more to pray , one minute more ! ” she pleaded —</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="97">“ Oh Anne , sister Anne , do you see anybody coming ? ”</l>

     <l n="99">“ Is it our brothers , Anne ? ” implored the lady . “ No , my sister ,</l>
     <l n="100">It is a flock of sheep . ” Here Blue-beard thundered out : “ I say ,</l>
     <l n="101">Come down or I 'll come after you ! ” Again the only answer :</l>
     <l n="102">“ Oh , just one little minute more ,— one minute more to pray ! ”</l>

     <l n="106">Then Blue-beard stamped his foot so hard</l>

     <l n="16">The sweetest her tongue had ever tasted ;</l>
     <l n="17">They were few in number , and small in size ,</l>
     <l n="18">Too good , though , to be wasted .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="19">And in that way the little Bo-Peep ,</l>

     <l n="21">To the top of the nearest knoll she ran ,</l>
     <l n="22">The better to look the pasture over ;</l>
     <l n="23">She shaded her face , and called , “ Nan ! Nan ! ”</l>
     <l n="24">But none of them could discover .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="25">About and about went little Bo-Peep ;</l>

     <l n="31">So down sat trustful little Bo-Peep ,</l>

     <l n="46">Rubbing her eyes to see the clearer ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="49">Tearful and sorrowful grew Bo-Peep !</l>

     <l n="52">Before it should be too dark to find them ;</l>
     <l n="53">She found them indeed , but it made her heart bleed ,</l>

     <l n="73">Though sorry enough was little Bo-Peep</l>

     <l n="79">She piled them up in a great white heap ,</l>
