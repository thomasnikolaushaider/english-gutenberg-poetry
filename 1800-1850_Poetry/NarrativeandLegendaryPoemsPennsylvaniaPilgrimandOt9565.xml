    <head>THE PENNSYLVANIA PILGRIM .</head>
    <head>INTRODUCTORY NOTE .</head>
    <head>THE beginning of German emigration to America may be traced to the personal influence of William Penn , who in 1677 visited the Continent , and made the acquaintance of an intelligent and highly cultivated circle of Pietists , or Mystics , who , reviving in the seventeenth century the spiritual faith and worship of Tauler and the “ Friends of God ” in the fourteenth , gathered about the pastor Spener , and the young and beautiful Eleonora Johanna Von Merlau . In this circle originated the Frankfort Land Company , which bought of William Penn , the Governor of Pennsylvania , a tract of land near the new city of Philadelphia . The company 's agent in the New World was a rising young lawyer , Francis Daniel Pastorius , son of Judge Pastorius , of Windsheim , who , at the age of seventeen , entered the University of Altorf . He studied law at , Strasburg , Basle , and Jena , and at Ratisbon , the seat of the Imperial Government , obtained a practical knowledge of international polity . Successful in all his examinations and disputations , he received the degree of Doctor of Law at Nuremberg in 1676 . In 1679 he was a law-lecturer at Frankfort , where he became deeply interested in the teachings of Dr. Spener . In 1680-81 he travelled in France , England , Ireland , and Italy with his friend Herr Von Rodeck . “ I was , ” he says , “ glad to enjoy again the company of my Christian friends , rather than be with Von Rodeck feasting and dancing . ” In 1683 , in company with a small number of German Friends , he emigrated to America , settling upon the Frankfort Company 's tract between the Schuylkill and the Delaware rivers . The township was divided into four hamlets , namely , Germantown , Krisheim , Crefield , and Sommerhausen . Soon after his arrival he united himself with the Society of Friends , and became one of its most able and devoted members , as well as the recognized head and lawgiver of the settlement . He married , two years after his arrival , Anneke ( Anna ) , daughter of Dr. Klosterman , of Muhlheim . In the year 1688 he drew up a memorial against slaveholding , which was adopted by the Germantown Friends and sent up to the Monthly Meeting , and thence to the Yearly Meeting at Philadelphia . It is noteworthy as the first protest made by a religious body against Negro Slavery . The original document was discovered in 1844 by the Philadelphia antiquarian , Nathan Kite , and published in The Friend ( Vol . XVIII . No . 16 ) . It is a bold and direct appeal to the best instincts of the heart . “ Have not , ” he asks , “ these negroes as much right to fight for their freedom as you have to keep them slaves ? ” Under the wise direction of Pastorius , the German-town settlement grew and prospered . The inhabitants planted orchards and vineyards , and surrounded themselves with souvenirs of their old home . A large number of them were linen-weavers , as well as small farmers . The Quakers were the principal sect , but men of all religions were tolerated , and lived together in harmony . In 1692 Richard Frame published , in what he called verse , a Description of Pennsylvania , in which he alludes to the settlement :—</head>
     <l n="1">“ The German town of which I spoke before ,</l>
     <l n="2">Which is at least in length one mile or more ,</l>
     <l n="3">Where lives High German people and Low Dutch ,</l>
     <l n="4">Whose trade in weaving linen cloth is much ,</l>
     <l n="5">— There grows the flax , as also you may know</l>
     <l n="6">That from the same they do divide the tow .</l>
     <l n="7">Their trade suits well their habitation ,</l>
     <l n="8">We find convenience for their occupation . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Pastorius seems to have been on intimate terms with William Penn , Thomas Lloyd , Chief Justice Logan , Thomas Story , and other leading men in the Province belonging to his own religious society , as also with Kelpius , the learned Mystic of the Wissahickon , with the pastor of the Swedes ’ church , and the leaders of the Mennonites . He wrote a description of Pennsylvania , which was published at Frankfort and Leipsic in 1700 and 1701 . His Lives of the Saints , etc ., written in German and dedicated to Professor Schurmberg , his old teacher , was published in 1690 . He left behind him many unpublished manuscripts covering a very wide range of subjects , most of which are now lost . One huge manuscript folio , entitled Hive Beestock , Melliotropheum Alucar , or Rusca Apium , still remains , containing one thousand pages with about one hundred lines to a page . It is a medley of knowledge and fancy , history , philosophy , and poetry , written in seven languages . A large portion of his poetry is devoted to the pleasures of gardening , the description of flowers , and the care of bees . The following specimen of his punning Latin is addressed to an orchard-pilferer :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Quisquis in haec furtim reptas viridaria nostra</l>
     <l n="2">Tangere fallaci poma caveto mane ,</l>
     <l n="3">Si non obsequeris faxit Deus omne quod opto ,</l>
     <l n="4">Cum malis nostris ut mala cuncta feras . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Professor Oswald Seidensticker , to whose papers in Der Deutsche Pioneer and that able periodical the Penn Monthly , of Philadelphia , I am indebted for many of the foregoing facts in regard to the German pilgrims of the New World , thus closes his notice of Pastorius :— “ No tombstone , not even a record of burial , indicates where his remains have found their last resting-place , and the pardonable desire to associate the homage due to this distinguished man with some visible memento can not be gratified . There is no reason to suppose that he was interred in any other place than the Friends ’ old burying-ground in Germantown , though the fact is not attested by any definite source of information . After all , this obliteration of the last trace of his earthly existence is but typical of what has overtaken the times which he represents ; that Germantown which he founded , which saw him live and move , is at present but a quaint idyl of the past , almost a myth , barely remembered and little cared for by the keener race that has succeeded . The Pilgrims of Plymouth have not lacked historian and poet . Justice has been done to their faith , courage , and self-sacrifice , and to the mighty influence of their endeavors to establish righteousness on the earth . The Quaker pilgrims of Pennsylvania , seeking the same object by different means , have not been equally fortunate . The power of their testimony for truth and holiness , peace and freedom , enforced only by what Milton calls “ the unresistible might of meekness , ” has been felt through two centuries in the amelioration of penal severities , the abolition of slavery , the reform of the erring , the relief of the poor and suffering ,— felt , in brief , in every step of human progress . But of the men themselves , with the single exception of William Penn , scarcely anything is known . Contrasted , from the outset , with the stern , aggressive Puritans of New England , they have come to be regarded as “ a feeble folk , ” with a personality as doubtful as their unrecorded graves . They were not soldiers , like Miles Standish ; they had no figure so picturesque as Vane , no leader so rashly brave and haughty as Endicott . No Cotton Mather wrote their Magnalia ; they had no awful drama of supernaturalism in which Satan and his angels were actors ; and the only witch mentioned in their simple annals was a poor old Swedish woman , who , on complaint of her countrywomen , was tried and acquitted of everything but imbecility and folly . Nothing but common-place offices of civility came to pass between them and the Indians ; indeed , their enemies taunted them with the fact that the savages did not regard them as Christians , but just such men as themselves . Yet it must be apparent to every careful observer of the progress of American civilization that its two principal currents had their sources in the entirely opposite directions of the Puritan and Quaker colonies . To use the words of a late writer :<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>“ The historical forces , with which no others may be compared in their influence on the people , have been those of the Puritan and the Quaker . The strength of the one was in the confession of an invisible Presence , a righteous , eternal Will , which would establish righteousness on earth ; and thence arose the conviction of a direct personal responsibility , which could be tempted by no external splendor and could be shaken by no internal agitation , and could not be evaded or transferred . The strength of the other was the witness in the human spirit to an eternal Word , an Inner Voice which spoke to each alone , while yet it spoke to every man ; a Light which each was to follow , and which yet was the light of the world ; and all other voices were silent before this , and the solitary path whither it led was more sacred than the worn ways of cathedral-aisles . ” It will be sufficiently apparent to the reader that , in the poem which follows , I have attempted nothing beyond a study of the life and times of the Pennsylvania colonist ,— a simple picture of a noteworthy man and his locality . The colors of my sketch are all very sober , toned down to the quiet and dreamy atmosphere through which its subject is visible . Whether , in the glare and tumult of the present time , such a picture will find favor may well be questioned . I only know that it has beguiled for me some hours of weariness , and that , whatever may be its measure of public appreciation , it has been to me its own reward . ” J. G. W. AMESBURY , 5th mo ., 1872 .</p>

   <p>PRELUDE . I SING the Pilgrim of a softer clime And milder speech than those brave men 's who brought To the ice and iron of our winter time A will as firm , a creed as stern , and wrought With one mailed hand , and with the other fought . Simply , as fits my theme , in homely rhyme I sing the blue-eyed German Spener taught , Through whose veiled , mystic faith the Inward Light , Steady and still , an easy brightness , shone , Transfiguring all things in its radiance white . The garland which his meekness never sought I bring him ; over fields of harvest sown With seeds of blessing , now to ripeness grown , I bid the sower pass before the reapers ’ sight .</p>

   <p>In the garden of her father little Elsie sits and spins , And , singing with the early birds , her daily task , begins . Gay tulips bloom and sweet mint curls around her garden-bower , But she is sweeter than the mint and fairer than the flower .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">About her form her kirtle blue clings lovingly , and ,</l>
     <l n="2">white</l>
     <l n="3">As snow , her loose sleeves only leave her small ,</l>
     <l n="4">round wrists in sight ;</l>
     <l n="5">Below , the modest petticoat can only half conceal</l>
     <l n="6">The motion of the lightest foot that ever turned a</l>
     <l n="7">wheel .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The cat sits purring at her side , bees hum in sunshine warm ; But , look ! she starts , she lifts her face , she shades it with her arm . And , hark ! a train of horsemen , with sound of dog and horn , Come leaping o'er the ditches , come trampling down the corn !</p>
   <p>Merrily rang the bridle-reins , and scarf and plume streamed gay , As fast beside her father 's gate the riders held their way ; And one was brave in scarlet cloak , with golden spur on heel , And , as he checked his foaming steed , the maiden checked her wheel .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ All hail among thy roses , the fairest rose to me !</l>
     <l n="2">For weary months in secret my heart has longed for</l>
     <l n="3">thee ! ”</l>
     <l n="4">What noble knight was this ? What words for</l>
     <l n="5">modest maiden 's ear ?</l>
     <l n="6">She dropped a lowly courtesy of bashfulness and</l>
     <l n="7">fear .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>She lifted up her spinning-wheel ; she fain would seek the door , Trembling in every limb , her cheek with blushes crimsoned o'er . “ Nay , fear me not , ” the rider said , “ I offer heart and hand , Bear witness these good Danish knights who round about me stand .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ I grant you time to think of this , to answer as</l>
     <l n="2">you may ,</l>
     <l n="3">For to-morrow , little Elsie , shall bring another day . ”</l>
     <l n="4">He spake the old phrase slyly as , glancing round</l>
     <l n="5">his train ,</l>
     <l n="6">He saw his merry followers seek to hide their</l>
     <l n="7">smiles in vain .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>“ The snow of pearls I 'll scatter in your curls of golden hair , I 'll line with furs the velvet of the kirtle that you wear ; All precious gems shall twine your neck ; and in a chariot gay You shall ride , my little Elsie , behind four steeds of gray .</p>
   <p>“ And harps shall sound , and flutes shall play , and brazen lamps shall glow ; On marble floors your feet shall weave the dances to and fro . At frosty eventide for us the blazing hearth shall shine , While , at our ease , we play at draughts , and drink the blood-red wine . ”</p>
   <p>Then Elsie raised her head and met her wooer face to face ; A roguish smile shone in her eye and on her lip found place . Back from her low white forehead the curls of gold she threw , And lifted up her eyes to his , steady and clear and blue .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ I am a lowly peasant , and you a gallant knight ;</l>
     <l n="2">I will not trust a love that soon may cool and turn</l>
     <l n="3">to slight .</l>
     <l n="4">If you would wed me henceforth be a peasant , not</l>
     <l n="5">a lord ;</l>
     <l n="6">I bid you hang upon the wall your tried and trusty</l>
     <l n="7">sword . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>“ To please you , Elsie , I will lay keen Dynadel away , And in its place will swing the scythe and mow your father 's hay . ” “ Nay , but your gallant scarlet cloak my eyes can never bear ; A Vadmal coat , so plain and gray , is all that you must wear . ”</p>
   <p>“ Well , Vadmal will I wear for you , ” the rider gayly spoke , “ And on the Lord 's high altar I 'll lay my scarlet cloak . ” “ But mark , ” she said , “ no stately horse my peasant love must ride , A yoke of steers before the plough is all that he must guide . ”</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">The knight looked down upon his steed : “ Well ,</l>
     <l n="2">let him wander free</l>
     <l n="3">No other man must ride the horse that has been</l>
     <l n="4">backed by me .</l>
     <l n="5">Henceforth I 'll tread the furrow and to my oxen</l>
     <l n="6">talk ,</l>
     <l n="7">If only little Elsie beside my plough will walk . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>“ You must take from out your cellar cask of wine and flask and can ; The homely mead I brew you may serve a peasant . man . ” “ Most willingly , fair Elsie , I 'll drink that mead of thine , And leave my minstrel 's thirsty throat to drain my generous wine . ”</p>
   <p>“ Now break your shield asunder , and shatter sign and boss , Unmeet for peasant-wedded arms , your knightly knee across . And pull me down your castle from top to basement wall , And let your plough trace furrows in the ruins of your hall ! ”</p>
   <p>Then smiled he with a lofty pride ; right well at last he knew The maiden of the spinning-wheel was to her troth . plight true . “ Ah , roguish little Elsie ! you act your part full well You know that I must bear my shield and in my castle dwell !</p>
   <p>“ The lions ramping on that shield between the hearts aflame Keep watch o'er Denmark 's honor , and guard her ancient name .</p>
   <p>“ For know that I am Volmer ; I dwell in yonder towers , Who ploughs them ploughs up Denmark , this goodly home of ours ’ .</p>
   <p>“ I tempt no more , fair Elsie ! your heart I know is true ; Would God that all our maidens were good and pure as you ! Well have you pleased your monarch , and he shall well repay ; God 's peace ! Farewell ! To-morrow will bring another day ! ”</p>
   <p>He lifted up his bridle hand , he spurred his good steed then , And like a whirl-blast swept away with all his gallant men . The steel hoofs beat the rocky path ; again on winds of morn The wood resounds with cry of hounds and blare of hunter 's horn .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Thou true and ever faithful ! ” the listening</l>
     <l n="2">Henrik cried ;</l>
     <l n="3">And , leaping o'er the green hedge , he stood by</l>
     <l n="4">Elsie 's side .</l>
     <l n="5">None saw the fond embracing , save , shining from</l>
     <l n="6">afar ,</l>
     <l n="7">The Golden Goose that watched them from the</l>
     <l n="8">tower of Valdemar .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>O darling girls of Denmark ! of all the flowers that throng Her vales of spring the fairest , I sing for you my song . No praise as yours so bravely rewards the singer 's skill ; Thank God ! of maids like Elsie the land has plenty still ! 1872 .</p>

    <head>THE WITCH OF WENHAM .</head>
    <head>The house is still standing in Danvers , Mass ., where , it is said , a suspected witch was confined overnight in the attic , which was bolted fast . In the morning when the constable came to take her to Salem for trial she was missing , although the door was still bolted . Her escape was doubtless aided by her friends , but at the time it was attributed to Satanic interference .</head>

    <head>THE DEAD FEAST OF THE KOL-FOLK .</head>
    <head>E. B. Tylor in his Primitive Culture , chapter xii ., gives an account of the reverence paid the dead by the Kol tribes of Chota Nagpur , Assam . “ When a Ho or Munda , ” he says , “ has been burned on the funeral pile , collected morsels of his bones are carried in procession with a solemn , ghostly , sliding step , keeping time to the deep-sounding drum , and when the old woman who carries the bones on her bamboo tray lowers it from time to time , then girls who carry pitchers and brass vessels mournfully reverse them to show that they are empty ; thus the remains are taken to visit every house in the village , and every dwelling of a friend or relative for miles , and the inmates come out to mourn and praise the goodness of the departed ; the bones are carried to all the dead man 's favorite haunts , to the fields he cultivated , to the grove he planted , to the threshing-floor where he worked , to the village dance-room where he made merry . At last they are taken to the grave , and buried in an earthen vase upon a store of food , covered with one of those huge stone slabs which European visitors wonder at in the districts of the aborigines of India . ” In the Journal of the Asiatic Society , Bengal , vol . ix ., p. 795 , is a Ho dirge .</head>

   <p>THE KING 'S MISSIVE . 1661 .</p>
   <p>This ballad , originally written for The Memorial History of Boston , describes , with pardonable poetic license , a memorable incident in the annals of the city . The interview between Shattuck and the Governor took place , I have since learned , in the residence of the latter , and not in the Council Chamber . The publication of the ballad led to some discussion as to the historical truthfulness of the picture , but I have seen no reason to rub out any of the figures or alter the lines and colors .</p>
