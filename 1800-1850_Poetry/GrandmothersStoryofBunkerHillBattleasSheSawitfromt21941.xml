     <l n="12">‘ T was a peaceful summer 's morning , when the first thing gave us warning</l>
     <l n="13">Was the booming of the cannon from the river and the shore :</l>

     <l n="34">Of the Corporal , our old neighbor , on that wooden leg he wore ,</l>
     <l n="35">With a knot of women round him ,— it was lucky I had found him ,</l>

     <l n="37">They were making for the steeple ,— the old soldier and his people ;</l>

     <l n="40">Stood a fortress on the hill-top that but yesterday was bare .</l>

     <l n="43">Not slow our eyes to find it ; well we knew who stood behind it ,</l>
     <l n="44">Though the earthwork hid them from us , and the stubborn walls were dumb :</l>
     <l n="45">Here were sister , wife , and mother , looking wild upon each other ,</l>

     <l n="53">Every woman 's heart grew bigger when we saw his manly figure ,</l>
     <l n="54">With the banyan buckled round it , standing up so straight and tall ;</l>
     <l n="55">Like a gentleman of leisure who is strolling out for pleasure ,</l>

     <l n="63">At length the men have started , with a cheer ( it seemed faint-hearted ) ,</l>
     <l n="64">In their scarlet regimentals , with their knapsacks on their backs ,</l>
     <l n="65">And the reddening , rippling water , as after a sea-fight 's slaughter ,</l>
