    <head>PREFACE .</head>
    <p n="1">I have for several years devoted many of my leisure hours to the study of the language , history , traditions , customs and superstitions of the Dakotas . These Indians are now commonly called the “ Sioux ” — a name given them by the early French traders and voyageurs . “ Dakota ” signifies alliance or confederation . Many separate bands , all having a common origin and speaking a common tongue , were united under this name . See “ Tah-Koo Wah-Kan , ” or “ The Gospel Among the Dakotas , ” by Stephen R. Riggs , pp . 1 to 6 inc .</p>
    <p n="2">They were , but yesterday , the occupants and owners of the fair forests and fertile prairies of Minnesota — a brave , hospitable and generous people ,— barbarians , indeed , but noble in their barbarism . They may be fitly called the Iroquois of the West . In form and features , in language and traditions , they are distinct from all other Indian tribes . When first visited by white men , and for many years afterwards , the Falls of St. Anthony ( by them called the Ha-Ha ) was the center of their country . They cultivated tobacco , and hunted the elk , the beaver and the bison . They were open-hearted , truthful and brave . In their wars with other tribes they seldom slew women or children , and rarely sacrificed the lives of their prisoners .</p>
    <p n="3">For many years their chiefs and head men successfully resisted the attempts to introduce spirituous liquors among them . More than a century ago an English trader was killed at Mendota , because he persisted , after repeated warnings by the chiefs , in dealing out mini-wakan ( Devil-water ) to the Dakota braves .</p>
    <p n="4">With open arms and generous hospitality they welcomed the first white men to their land ; and were ever faithful in their friendship , till years of wrong and robbery , and want and insult , drove them to desperation and to war . They were barbarians , and their warfare was barbarous , but not more barbarous than the warfare of our Saxon and Celtic ancestors . They were ignorant and superstitious , but their condition closely resembled the condition of our British forefathers at the beginning of the Christian era . Macaulay says of Britain , “ Her inhabitants , when first they became known to the Tyrian mariners , were little superior to the natives of the Sandwich Islands . ” And again , “ While the German princes who reigned at Paris , Toledo , Arles and Ravenna listened with reverence to the instructions of Bishops , adored the relics of martyrs , and took part eagerly in disputes touching the Nicene theology , the rulers of Wessex and Mercia were still performing savage rites in the temples of Thor and Woden . ”</p>
    <p n="5">The day of the Dakotas is done . The degenerate remnants of that once powerful and warlike people still linger around the forts and agencies of the Northwest , or chase the caribou and the bison on the banks of the Sascatchewan , but the Dakotas of old are no more . The brilliant defeat of Custer , by Sitting Bull and his braves , was their last grand rally against the resistless march of the sons of the Saxons and the Celts . The plow-shares of a superior race are fast leveling the sacred mounds of their dead . But yesterday , the shores of our lakes , and our rivers , were dotted with their tepees . Their light canoes glided over our waters , and their hunters chased the deer and the buffalo on the sites of our cities . To-day , they are not . Let us do justice to their memory , for there was much that was noble in their natures . In the following Dakota Legends I have endeavored to faithfully represent many of the customs and superstitions , and some of the traditions , of that people . I have taken very little “ poetic license ” with their traditions ; none , whatever , with their customs and superstitions . In my studies for these Legends I have been greatly aided by Rev . S. R. Riggs , author of the Grammar and Dictionary of the Dakota language , “ Tah-Koo Wah-Kan , ” &amp; c ., and for many years a missionary among the Dakotas . He has patiently answered my numerous inquiries and given me valuable information . I am also indebted to Gen. H. H. Sibley , one of the earliest American traders among them , and to Rev . S. W. Pond , of Shakopee , one of the first Protestant missionaries to these people , and himself the author of poetical versions of some of their principal legends ; to Mrs. Eastman 's “ Dacotah . ” and last , but not least , to the Rev . E. D. Neill , whose admirable “ History of Minnesota ” so fully and faithfully presents almost all that is known of the history , traditions , customs , manners and superstitions of the Dakotas . In Winona I have “ tried my hand ” on Hexameter verse . With what success , I leave to those who are better able to judge than I . If I have failed , I have but added another failure to the numerous vain attempts to naturalize Hexameter verse in the English language .</p>
    <p n="6">The Earl of Derby , in the preface to his translation of the Iliad , calls it “ That pestilent heresy of the so-called English Hexameter ; a metre wholly repugnant to the genius of our language ; which can only be pressed into the service by a violation of every rule of prosody . ” Lord Kames , in his “ Elements of Criticism . ” says , “ Many attempts have been made to introduce Hexameter verse into the living languages , but without success . The English language , I am inclined to think , is not susceptible of this melody , and my reasons are these : First , the polysyllables in Latin and Greek are finely diversified by long and short syllables , a circumstance that qualifies them for the melody of Hexameter verse : ours are extremely ill qualified for that service , because they super-abound in short syllables . Secondly , the bulk of our monosyllables are arbitrary with regard to length , which is an unlucky circumstance in Hexameter . * * * In Latin and Greek Hexameter invariable sounds direct and ascertain the melody . English Hexameter would be destitute of melody , unless by artful pronunciation ; because of necessity the bulk of its sounds must be arbitrary . The pronunciation is easy in a simple movement of alternate long and short syllables ; but would be perplexing and unpleasant in the diversified movement of Hexameter verse . ”</p>
    <p n="7">Beautiful as is the Evangeline of Longfellow , his Hexameter lines are sometimes hard to scan , and often grate harshly on the ear . He is frequently forced to divide a word by the central or pivotal pause of the line , and sometimes to make a pause in the sense where the rhythm forbids it . Take for example some of the opening lines of Evangeline :</p>
    <p n="8">“ This is the forest prime | val . The murmuring pines and the hemlocks , Bearded with moss , and in gar | ments green , indistinct in the twilight . Loud from its rocky cav | erns , the deep-voiced neighboring ocean Speaks , and in accents discon | solate answers the wail of the forest . Lay in the fruitful val | ley . Vast meadows stretched to the eastward . ”</p>
    <p n="9">Again , in order to comply with the Greek and Latin rule of beginning each line with a long syllable , he is compelled to emphasize words contrary to the sense . Examples :</p>
    <p n="10">In the Acadian land , on the shores of the Basin of Minas Somewhat apart from the vil | lage , and nearer the Basin of Minas . But a celestial bright | ness — a more etherial beauty . And the retreating sun the sign of the scorpion enters . In-doors , warmed by the wide - | mouthed fireplace idly the farmer , Four times the sun had ris | en and set ; and now on the fifth day ,</p>
    <p n="11">“ Greek and Latin Hexameter lines , as to time , are all of the same length , being equivalent to the time taken in pronouncing twelve long syllables , or twenty-four short ones . An Hexameter line may consist of seventeen syllables , and when regular and not Spondiac , it never has fewer than thirteen : whence it follows that where the syllables are many , the plurality must be short ; where few , the plurality must be long . This line is susceptible of much variety as to the succession of long and short syllables . It is however subject to laws that confine its variety within certain limits . * * *</p>
    <p n="12">1st . The line must always commence with a long syllable , and close with two long preceded by two short .</p>
    <p n="13">2d . More than two short syllables can never be found together , nor fewer than two .</p>
    <p n="14">3d . Two long syllables which have been preceded by two short can not also be followed by two short .</p>
    <p n="15">These few rules fulfill all the conditions of an Hexameter line with relation to order of arrangement . ” — Lord Kames , “ Elements of Criticism . ” One who attempts to write English Hexameter , under the Greek and Latin rules , will speedily be made aware that the English language “ super-abounds in short syllables . ” Why then should we rigidly adhere to rules repugnant to the genius of our language , if they can be modified so as to adapt the sonorous Hexameter to the structure of our mother-tongue ? Can they be so modified ? I have attempted it . I venture to change them as follows :</p>
    <p n="16">1st . By beginning each line with a short syllable instead of a long one . And it will be seen that I often begin a line with two short syllables .</p>
    <p n="17">2d . By often using one short syllable unaccompanied by another .</p>
    <p n="18">3d . I have increased the average number of syllables in the line to better adapt it to our super-abundance of short syllables .</p>
    <p n="19">4th . In Winona I have introduced a rhyme at the pivotal pause of the line , not because my Hexameter requires it , but because I think it increases the melody , and more emphatically marks the central pause .</p>
    <p n="20">I am not quite sure that , in a long poem , the rhyme is not detrimental . That depends greatly , however , upon the skill with which it is handled . Surely the same Hexameter can be written as smoothly and more vigorously without rhyme . Rhyme adds greatly to the labor of composition ; it rarely assists , but often hinders , the expression of the sense which the author would convey . At times I have been on the point of abandoning it in despair , but after having been under the hammer and the file , at intervals for the last four years , Winona is at last done , if not finished .</p>
    <p n="21">It will be observed that I have slightly changed the length and the rhythm of the old Hexameter line , but it is still Hexameter , and , I think , improved . I am not afraid of intelligent criticism . I invoke it , and will endeavor to profit by it in the future as in the past .</p>
    <p n="22">The reception of my Pauline at home and abroad has been so flattering that I have been encouraged to attempt something better . That was my first real effort and full of crudities but if the Legends are received by our best critics as well as Pauline was received I shall be well pleased with my efforts .</p>
    <p n="23">After much thought I have decided to publish the first edition of my Legends here at home :</p>
    <p n="24">1st Because they pertain particularly to the lakes and rivers to the fair forests and fertile fields of our own Minnesota and ought to be appreciated here if anywhere .</p>
    <p n="25">2d Because many of our people are competent to judge whether my representations of Dakota customs , life , traditions , and superstitions are correct or not and at the same time the reading public of the North west is as intelligent and discriminating as that of any other portion of our country . If these Legends be appreciated and approved by our own people who are familiar with the scenery described and more or less , with the customs , traditions and superstitions of the Dakotas , and if beyond that these poems shall stand the test of candid criticism I may give them a wider publication .</p>

     <l n="1">Onward rolls the Royal River , proudly sweeping to the sea ,</l>
     <l n="2">Dark and deep and grand , forever wrapt in myth and mystery .</l>
     <l n="3">Lo he laughs along the highlands , leaping o'er the granite walls :</l>
     <l n="4">Lo he sleeps among the islands , where the loon her lover calls .</l>
     <l n="5">Still like some huge monster winding downward</l>
     <l n="6">through the prairie plains ,</l>
     <l n="7">Seeking rest but never finding , till the tropic gulf he gains .</l>
     <l n="8">In his mighty arms he claspeth now an empire broad and grand ;</l>
     <l n="9">In his left hand lo he graspeth leagues of fen and forest land ;</l>
     <l n="10">In his right the mighty mountains , hoary with eternal snow .</l>
     <l n="11">Where a thousand foaming fountains singing seek the plains below .</l>
     <l n="12">Fields of corn and feet of cities lo the mighty river laves ,</l>
     <l n="13">Where the Saxon sings his ditties o'er the swarthy warriors ’ graves .</l>
     <l n="14">Aye , before the birth , of Moses — ere the Pyramids were piled —</l>
     <l n="15">All his banks were red with roses from the sea to nor'lands wild ,</l>
     <l n="16">And from forest , fen and meadows , in the deserts of the north ,</l>
     <l n="17">Elk and bison stalked like shadows , and the tawny tribes came forth ;</l>
     <l n="18">Deeds of death and deeds of daring on his leafy banks were done —</l>
     <l n="19">Women loved and men went warring — ere the siege of Troy begun .</l>
     <l n="20">Where his wayward waters thundered , roaring o'er the rocky walls ,</l>
     <l n="21">Dusky hunters sat and wondered , listening to the spirits ’ calls .</l>
     <l n="22">“ Ha-ha ! ”<span type="note_anchor">[ 76 ]</span>cried the warrior greeting from afar the cataract 's roar ;</l>
     <l n="23">“ Ha-ha ! ” rolled the answer ,</l>
     <l n="24">beating down the rock-ribbed leagues of shore .</l>
     <l n="25">Now , alas , the bow and quiver and the dusky braves have fled ,</l>
     <l n="26">And the sullen , shackled river drives the droning mills instead .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="27">Where the war whoop rose , and , after , women wailed their warriors slain ,</l>
     <l n="28">List the Saxon 's silvery laughter , and his humming hives of gain .</l>
     <l n="29">Swiftly sped the tawny runner o'er the pathless prairies then ,</l>
     <l n="30">Now the iron-reindeer sooner carries weal or woe to men .</l>
     <l n="31">On thy bosom , Royal River , silent sped the birch canoe ,</l>
     <l n="32">Bearing brave with bow and quiver , on his way to war or woo ;</l>
     <l n="33">Now with flaunting flags and streamers — mighty monsters of the deep —</l>
     <l n="34">Lo the puffing , panting steamers , through thy foaming waters sweep ;</l>
     <l n="35">And behold the grain-fields golden , where the bison grazed of eld ;</l>
     <l n="36">See the fanes of forests olden by the ruthless Saxon felled ,—</l>
     <l n="37">Pluméd pines that spread their shadows ere Columbus spread his sails .</l>
     <l n="38">Firs that fringed the mossy meadows ere the Mayflower braved the gales ,</l>
     <l n="39">Iron oaks that nourished bruin while the Vikings roamed the main ,</l>
     <l n="40">Crashing fall in broken ruin for the greedy marts of gain .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="41">Still forever and forever rolls the restless river on ,</l>
     <l n="42">Slumbering oft but ceasing never , while the circling centuries run .</l>
     <l n="43">In his palm the lakelet lingers , in his hair the brooklets hide ,</l>
     <l n="44">Grasped within his thousand fingers lies a continent fair and wide ,—</l>
     <l n="45">Yea , a mighty empire swarming with its millions like the bees ,</l>
     <l n="46">Delving , drudging , striving , storming , all their lives , for golden ease .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="47">Still , methinks , the dusky shadows of the days that are no more</l>
     <l n="48">Stalk around the lakes and meadows , haunting oft the wonted shore ,—</l>
     <l n="49">Hunters from the land of spirits seek the bison and the deer ,</l>
     <l n="50">Where the Saxon now inherits golden field and silver mere ;</l>
     <l n="51">And beside the mound where burried lies the dark-eyed maid he loves ,</l>
     <l n="52">Some tall warrior , wan and wearied , in the misty moonlight moves .</l>
     <l n="53">See — he stands erect and lingers — stoic still , but loth to go —</l>
     <l n="54">Clutching in his tawny fingers feathered shaft and polished bow .</l>
     <l n="55">Never wail or moan he utters and no tear is on his face ,</l>
     <l n="56">But a warrior 's curse he mutters on the crafty Saxon race .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="57">O thou dark , mysterious River , speak and tell thy tales to me ;</l>
     <l n="58">Seal not up thy lips forever — veiled in mist and mystery .</l>
     <l n="59">I will sit and lowly listen at the phantom-haunted falls ,</l>
     <l n="60">Where thy waters foam and glisten o'er the rugged , rocky walls .</l>
     <l n="61">Till some spirit of the olden , mystic , weird , romantic days</l>
     <l n="62">Shall emerge and pour her golden tales and legends through my lays .</l>
     <l n="63">Then again the elk and bison on thy grassy banks shall feed ,</l>
     <l n="64">And along the low horizon shall the pluméd hunter speed ;</l>
     <l n="65">Then again on lake and river shall the silent birch canoe</l>
     <l n="66">Bear the brave with bow and quiver on his way to war or woo :</l>
     <l n="67">Then the beaver on the meadow shall rebuild his broken wall ,</l>
     <l n="68">And the wolf shall chase his shadow and his mate the panther call .</l>
     <l n="69">From the prairies and the regions where the pine-plumed forest grows</l>
     <l n="70">Shall arise the tawny legions with their lances and their bows ;</l>
     <l n="71">And again the shouts of battle shall resound along the plain ,</l>
     <l n="72">Bows shall twang and quivers rattle , women wail their warriors slain .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">The sun sails high in his azure realms ;</l>
     <l n="2">Beneath the arch of the breezy elms</l>
     <l n="3">The feast is spread by the murmuring river .</l>
     <l n="4">With his battle spear and his bow and quiver ,</l>
     <l n="5">And eagle plumes in his ebon hair ,</l>
     <l n="6">The chief Wakâwa himself is there ;</l>
     <l n="7">And round the feast in the Sacred Ring ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 48 ]</span></l>
     <l n="8">Sit his weaponed warriors witnessing .</l>
     <l n="9">Not a morsel of food have the Virgins tasted</l>
     <l n="10">For three long days ere the holy feast ;</l>
     <l n="11">They sat in their teepee alone and fasted ,</l>
     <l n="12">Their faces turned to the Sacred East .<span type="note_anchor">[ 21 ]</span></l>
     <l n="13">In the polished bowls lies the golden maize</l>
     <l n="14">And the flesh of fawn on the polished trays .</l>
     <l n="15">For the Virgins the bloom of the prairies wide —</l>
     <l n="16">The blushing pink and the meek blue-bell ,</l>
     <l n="17">The purple plumes of the prairie 's pride ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 49 ]</span></l>
     <l n="18">The wild , uncultured asphodel ,</l>
     <l n="19">And the beautiful , blue-eyed violet</l>
     <l n="20">That the Virgins call “ Let-me-not-forget , ”</l>
     <l n="21">In gay festoons and garlands twine</l>
     <l n="22">With the cedar sprigs<span type="note_anchor">[ 50 ]</span>and the wildwood vine .</l>
     <l n="23">So gaily the Virgins are decked and dressed ,</l>
     <l n="24">And none but a virgin may enter there ;</l>
     <l n="25">And clad is each in a scarlet vest ,</l>
     <l n="26">And a fawn skin frock to the brown calves bare .</l>
     <l n="27">Wild rosebuds peep from their flowing hair ,</l>
     <l n="28">And a rose half-blown on the budding breast ;</l>
     <l n="29">And bright with the quills of the porcupine</l>
     <l n="30">The moccasined feet of the maidens shine .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="31">Hand in hand round the feast they dance ,</l>

     <l n="33">And never a pause or a dissonance</l>
     <l n="34">In the merry dance or the merry tune .</l>
     <l n="35">Brown-bosomed and fair as the rising moon ,</l>
     <l n="36">When she peeps o'er the hills of the dewy east ,</l>
     <l n="37">Wiwâstè sings at the Virgins Feast ;</l>
     <l n="38">And bright is the light in her luminous eyes ;</l>
     <l n="39">They glow like the stars in the winter skies ;</l>
     <l n="40">And the lilies that bloom in her virgin heart</l>
     <l n="41">Their golden blush to her cheeks impart —</l>
     <l n="42">Her cheeks half hid in her midnight hair .</l>
     <l n="43">Fair is her form — as the red fawn 's fair ,</l>
     <l n="44">And long is the flow of her raven hair ;</l>
     <l n="45">It falls to her knees , and it streams on the breeze</l>

Like the summer sun peeping , at morn , o'er the hills was the face of Winona ; And here she grew up like a queen — a romping and lily-lipped laughter , And danced on the undulant green , and played in the frolicsome waters , Where the foaming tide tumbles and twirls o'er the murmuring rocks in the rapids ; And whiter than foam were the pearls that gleamed in the midst of her laughter . Long and dark was her flowing hair flung , like the robe of the night to the breezes ; And gay as the robin she sung , or the gold-breasted lark of the meadows . Like the wings of the wind were her feet , and as sure as the feet of Ta-tó-ka ; [ b ] And oft like an antelope fleet o'er the hills and the prairies she bounded , Lightly laughing in sport as she ran , and looking back over her shoulder , At the fleet footed maiden or man , that vainly her flying steps followed . The belle of the village was she , and the pride of the aged Ta-té-psin , Like a sunbeam she lighted his tee , and gladdened the heart of her father .</p>

Unsteady his steps were and slow , and he walked with a staff in his right hand , And white as the first-falling snow were the thin locks that lay on his shoulders . Like rime-covered moss hung his beard , flowing down from his face to his girdle ; And wan was his aspect and weird ; and often he chanted and mumbled In a strange and mysterious tongue , as he bent o'er his book in devotion . Or lifted his dim eyes and sung , in a low voice , the solemn “ Te Deum . ” Or Latin , or Hebrew , or Greek — all the same were his words to the warriors ,— All the same to the maids and the meek , wide-wondering-eyed , hazel-brown children .</p>

   <p>There little by little he learned the tongue of the tawny Dakotas ; And the heart of the good father yearned to lead them away from their idols — Their giants<span type="note_anchor">[ 16 ]</span>and dread Thunder-birds — their worship of stones<span type="note_anchor">[ 73 ]</span>and the devil . “ Wakán-de ! ” [ a ] they answered his words , for he read from his book in the Latin , Lest the Nazarene 's holy commands by his tongue should be marred in translation ; And oft with his beads in his hands , or the cross and the crucified Jesus , He knelt by himself on the sands , and his dim eyes uplifted to heaven . But the braves bade him look to the East — to the silvery lodge of Han-nán-na ; [ b ] And to dance with the chiefs at the feast — at the feast of the Giant Heyó-ka .<span type="note_anchor">[ 16 ]</span>They frowned when the good father spurned the flesh of the dog in the kettle , And laughed when his fingers were burned in the hot , boiling pot of the giant . “ The Blackrobe ” they called the poor priest , from the hue of his robe and his girdle ; And never a game or a feast but the father must grace with his presence . His prayer book the hunters revered , — they deemed it a marvelous spirit ; It spoke and the white father heard , — it interpreted visions and omens . And often they bade him to pray this marvelous spirit to answer , And tell where the sly Chippeway might be ambushed and slain in his forests . For Menard was the first in the land , proclaiming , like John in the desert — “ The Kingdom of Heaven is at hand ; repent ye , and turn from your idols . ” — The first of the brave brotherhood that , threading the fens and the forest , Stood afar by the turbulent flood at the falls of the Father of Waters .</p>
   <p>[ a ] It is wonderful . [ b ] The morning .</p>
   <p>In the lodge of the Stranger [ a ] he sat awaiting the crown of a martyr ; His sad face compassion begat in the heart of the dark eyed Winona . Oft she came to the teepee and spoke ; she brought him the tongue of the bison , Sweet nuts from the hazel and oak , and flesh of the fawn and the mallard . Soft hánpa [ b ] she made for his feet and leggins of velvety fawn-skin ,— A blanket of beaver complete , and a hood of the hide of the otter . And oft at his feet on the mat , deftly braiding the flags and the rushes , Till the sun sought his teepee she sat , enchanted with what he related Of the white winged ships on the sea and the teepees far over the ocean , Of the love and the sweet charity of the Christ and the beautiful Virgin .</p>
   <p>[ a ] A lodge set apart for guests of the village . [ b ] Moccasins .</p>
   <p>She listened like one in a trance when he spoke of the brave , bearded Frenchmen , From the green sun-lit valleys of France to the wild Hochelága [ a ] transplanted , Oft trailing the deserts of snow in the heart of the dense Huron forests , Or steering the dauntless canoe through the waves of the fresh water ocean . “ Yea , stronger and braver are they , ” said the aged Menard to Winona , “ Than the head-chief , tall Wazi-kuté ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 74 ]</span>but their words are as soft as a maiden 's ; Their eyes are the eyes of the swan , but their hearts are the hearts of the eagles ; And the terrible Máza Wakán [ b ] ever walks , by their side like a spirit . Like a Thunder-bird , roaring in wrath , flinging fire from his terrible talons , It sends to their enemies death , in the flash of the fatal Wakándee . ” [ c ]</p>

   <p>The Autumn was past and the snow lay drifted and deep on the prairies ; From his teepee of ice came the foe — came the storm-breathing god of the winter . Then roared in the groves ,— on the plains , — on the ice-covered lakes and the river — The blasts of the fierce hurricanes blown abroad from the breast of Wazíya .<span type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>The bear cuddled down in his den , and the elk fled away to the forest ; The pheasant and gray prairie-hen made their beds in the heart of the snow-drift ; The bison-herds huddled and stood in the hollows and under the hill-sides ; Or rooted the snow for their food in the lee of the bluffs and the timber ; And the mad winds that howled from the north , from the ice-covered seas of Wazíya , Chased the gray wolf and red fox and swarth to their dens in the hills of the forest .</p>
   <p>Poor Father Menard ,— he was ill ; in his breast burned the fire of the fever ; All in vain was the magical skill of Wicásta Wakán<span type="note_anchor">[ 61 ]</span>with his rattle ; Into soft child-like slumber he fell , and awoke in the land of the blessèd — To the holy applause of “ Well done ! ” and the harps in the hands of the angels . Long he carried the cross , and he won the coveted crown of a martyr .</p>

     <l n="7">Then winter followed winter .</l>
     <l n="8">The years sprinkled frost on the head of her father ;</l>

   <p>Till the red Harvest Moon<span type="note_anchor">[ 71 ]</span>he remained in the vale of the swift Mississippi . The esteem of the warriors he gained , and the love of the dark eyed Winona . He joined in the sports and the chase ; with the hunters he followed the bison , And swift were his feet in the race when the red elk they ran on the prairies . At the Game of the Plum-stones<span type="note_anchor">[ 77 ]</span>he played and he won from the skillfulest players ; A feast to Wa'tánka<span type="note_anchor">[ 78 ]</span>he made , and he danced at the feast of Heyóka .<span type="note_anchor">[ 16 ]</span>With the flash and the roar of his gun he astonished the fearless Dakotas ; They called it the “ Máza Wakán ” — the mighty , mysterious metal . “ ‘ Tis a brother , ” they said , “ of the fire in the talons of dreadful Wakínyan ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 32 ]</span>When he flaps his huge wings in his ire , and shoots his red shafts at Unktéhee . ”<span type="note_anchor">[ 69 ]</span></p>
   <p>The Itancan ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 74 ]</span>tall Wazí-kuté , appointed a day for the races . From the red stake that stood by his tee , on the southerly side of the Ha-ha To a stake at the Lake of the Loons<span type="note_anchor">[ 79 ]</span>— a league and return — was the distance . On the crest of the hills red batons marked the course for the feet of the runners . They gathered from near and afar , to the races and dancing and feasting . Five hundred tall warriors were there from Kapóza<span type="note_anchor">[ 6 ]</span>and far off Keóza ;<span type="note_anchor">[ 8 ]</span>Remnica , [ a ] too , furnished a share of the legions that thronged to the races , And a bountiful feast was prepared by the diligent hands of the women , And gaily the multitudes fared in the generous tees of Kathága . The chief of the mystical clan appointed a feast to Unktéhee — The mystic “ Wacípee Wakán ” [ b ] — at the end of the day and the races . A band of sworn brothers are they , and the secrets of each one are sacred . And death to the lips that betray is the doom of the swarthy avengers , And the son of tall Wazí-kuté was the chief of the mystical order .</p>
   <p>[ a ] Pronounced Ray mne chah — the village of the Mountains situate where Red Wing now stands . [ b ] Sacred Dance — The Medicine dance — See description infra .</p>
   <p>On an arm of an oak hangs the prize for the swiftest and strongest of runners — A blanket as red as the skies , when the flames sweep the plains in October . And beside it a strong , polished bow , and a quiver of iron tipped arrows , Which Kapóza 's tall chief will bestow on the fleet-footed second that follows . A score of swift-runners are there from the several bands of the nation ; And now for the race they prepare , and among them fleet-footed Tamdóka . With the oil of the buck and the bear their sinewy limbs are anointed , For fleet are the feet of the deer and strong are the limbs of the bruin , And long is the course and severe for the swiftest and strongest of runners .</p>
   <p>Hark !— the shouts and the braying of drums , and the Babel of tongues and confusion ! From his teepee the tall chieftain comes , and Duluth brings a prize for the runners — A keen hunting-knife from the Seine , horn-handled and mounted with silver . The runners are ranged on the plain , and the Chief waves a flag as a signal , And away like the gray wolves they fly — like the wolves on the trail of the red deer ; O'er the hills and the prairie they vie , and strain their strong limbs to the utmost , While high on the hills hangs a cloud of warriors and maidens and mothers , To behold the swift runners , and loud are the cheers and the shouts of the warriors .</p>
   <p>Now swift from the lake they return , o'er the emerald hills and the heather ; Like grey-hounds they pant and they yearn , and the leader of all is Tamdóka . At his heels flies Hu-pá-hu , [ a ] the fleet — the pride of the band of Kaóza , A warrior with eagle-winged feet , but his prize is the bow and the quiver . Tamdóka first reaches the post , and his are the knife and the blanket , By the mighty acclaim of the host and award of the chief and the judges . Then proud was the tall warrior 's stride , and haughty his look and demeanor ; He boasted aloud in his pride , and he scoffed at the rest of the runners . “ Behold me , for I am a man ! [ b ] my feet are as swift as the West wind . With the coons and the beavers I ran ; but where is the elk or the cabri ?<span type="note_anchor">[ 80 ]</span>Come !— where is the hunter will dare match his feet with the feet of Tamdóka ? Let him think of Taté [ c ] and beware , ere he stake his last robe on the trial . ” “ Ohó ! Ho ! Hó-héca ! ” [ d ] they jeered , for they liked not the boast of the boaster ; But to match him no warrior appeared , for his feet wore the wings of the west-wind .</p>
   <p>[ a ] The wings . [ b ] A favorite boast of the Dakota braves . [ c ] The wind . [ d ] About equivalent to Oho — Aha — fudge .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Then forth from the side of the chief</l>
     <l n="2">stepped DuLuth and he looked on the boaster ;</l>
     <l n="3">“ The words of a warrior are brief ,</l>
     <l n="4">— I will run with the brave , ” said the Frenchman ;</l>
     <l n="5">“ But the feet of Tamdóka are tired ;</l>
     <l n="6">abide till the cool of the sunset . ”</l>
     <l n="7">All the hunters and maidens admired ,</l>
     <l n="8">for strong were the limbs of the stranger .</l>
     <l n="9">“ Hiwó ! Ho ! ” [ a ] they shouted</l>
     <l n="10">and loud rose the cheers of the multitude mingled ;</l>
     <l n="11">And there in the midst of the crowd</l>
     <l n="12">stood the glad-eyed and blushing Winona .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="13">[ a ] Hurra there !</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Now afar o'er the plains of the west walked the sun at the end of his journey , And forth came the brave and the guest , at the tap of the drum , for the trial . Like a forest of larches the hordes were gathered to witness the contest ; As loud is the drums were their words and they roared like the roar of the Ha-ha . For some for Tamdóka contend , and some for the fair , bearded stranger , And the betting runs high to the end , with the skins of the bison and beaver . A wife of tall Wazi-kuté — the mother of boastful Tamdóka — Brought her handsomest robe from the tee , with a vaunting and loud proclamation : She would stake her last robe on her son who , she boasted , was fleet as the Cábri<span type="note_anchor">[ 80 ]</span>And the tall , tawny chieftain looked on , approving the boast of the mother . Then fleet as the feet of a fawn to her lodge ran the dark eyed Winona , She brought and she staked on the lawn , by the side of the robe of the boaster , The lily-red mantle Duluth , with his own hands , had laid on her shoulders . “ Tamdóka is swift , but forsooth , the tongue of his mother is swifter , ” She said , and her face was aflame with the red of the rose and the lily , And loud was the roar of acclaim ; but dark was the face of Tamdóka .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">They strip for the race and prepare ,</l>
     <l n="2">— DuLuth in his breeches and leggins ;</l>
     <l n="3">And the brown , curling locks of his hair</l>
     <l n="4">downward droop to his bare , brawny shoulders ,</l>
     <l n="5">And his face wears a smile debonair ,</l>
     <l n="6">as he tightens his red sash around him ;</l>
     <l n="7">But stripped to the moccasins bare ,</l>
     <l n="8">save the belt and the breech-clout of buckskin ,</l>
     <l n="9">Stands the haughty Tamdóka aware</l>
     <l n="10">that the eyes of the warriors admire him ;</l>
     <l n="11">For his arms are the arms of a bear</l>
     <l n="12">and his legs are the legs of a panther .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The drum beats ,— the chief waves the flag , and away on the course speed the runners , And away leads the brave like a stag , — like a hound on his track flies the Frenchman ; And away haste the hunters , once more , to the hills for a view to the lake-side , And the dark-swarming hill-tops , they roar with the storm of loud voices commingled . Far away o'er the prairie they fly , and still in the lead is Tamdóka , But the feet of his rival are nigh , and slowly he gains on the hunter . Now they turn on the post at the lake , — now they run full abreast on the home-stretch ; Side by side they contend for the stake , for a long mile or more on the prairie . They strain like a stag and a hound , when the swift river gleams through the thicket , And the horns of the rulers resound , winding shrill through the depths of the forest . But behold !— at full length on the ground falls the fleet-footed Frenchman abruptly . And away with a whoop and a bound , springs the eager , exulting Tamdóka . Long and loud on the hills is the shout of his swarthy admirers and backers ; “ But the race is not won till it 's out , ” said DuLuth , to himself as he gathered , With a frown on his face , for the foot of the wily Tamdóka had tripped him . Far ahead ran the brave on the route , and turning he boasted exultant . Like spurs to the steed to DuLuth were the jeers and the taunts of the boaster ; Indignant was he and red wroth , at the trick of the runner dishonest ; And away like a whirlwind he speeds — like a hurricane mad from the mountains ; He gains on Tamdóka ,— he leads ! — and behold , with the spring of a panther , He leaps to the goal and succeeds , ‘ mid the roar of the mad acclamation .</p>
   <p>Then glad as the robin in May was the voice of Winona exulting ; And the crest-fallen brave turned away , and lonely he walked by the river ; He glowered as he went and the fire of revenge in his bosom was kindled , But he strove to dissemble his ire , and he whistled alone by the Ha-ha .</p>

From the brow of the Beautiful Isle , [ a ] half hid in the midst of the maples , The sad-faced Winona , the while , watched the boat growing less in the distance . Till away in the bend of the stream , where it turned and was lost in the lindens , She saw the last dip and the gleam of the oars ere they vanished forever . Still afar on the waters the song , like bridal bells distantly chiming , The stout , jolly boatmen prolong , beating time with the stroke of their paddles ; And Winona 's ear , turned to the breeze , lists the air falling fainter and fainter Till it dies like the murmur of bees when the sun is aslant on the meadows .

   <p>With sable wings wide o'er the land , night sprinkles the dew of the heavens ; And hard by the dark river 's strand , in the midst of a tall , somber forest , Two camp-fires are lighted , and beam on the trunks and the arms of the pine-trees . In the fitful light darkle and gleam the swarthy-hued faces around them . And one is the camp of DuLuth , and the other the camp of Tamdóka , But few are the jests and uncouth of the voyageurs over their supper , While moody and silent the braves round their fire in a circle sit crouching ; And low is the whisper of leaves and the sough of the wind in the branches ; And low is the long-winding howl of the lone wolf afar in the forest ; But shrill is the hoot of the owl , like a bugle blast blown in the pine-tops , And the half-startled voyageurs scowl at the sudden and saucy intruder . Like the eyes of the wolves are the eyes of the watchful and silent Dakotas ; Like the face of the moon in the skies , when the clouds chase each other across it . Is Tamdóka 's dark face in the light of the flickering flames of the camp fire . They have plotted red murder by night , and securely contemplate their victims . But wary and armed to the teeth are the resolute Frenchmen and ready , If need be , to grapple with death , and to die hand to hand in the desert . Yet skilled in the arts and the wiles of the cunning and crafty Algonkins , They cover their hearts with their smiles , and hide their suspicions of evil . Round their low , smouldering fire , feigning sleep , lie the watchful and wily Dakotas ; But DuLuth and his voyageurs heap their fire that shall blaze till the morning , Ere they lay themselves snugly to rest , with their guns by their side on the blankets , As if there were none to molest but the ravening beasts of the forest .</p>

   <p>In the gray of the morn , ere the sun peeped over the dewy horizon , Their journey again was begun , and they toiled up the swift , winding river ; And many a shallow they passed on their way to the Lake of the Spirits ; But dauntless they reached it at last , and found Akee-pá-kee-tin 's village , [ a ] On an isle in the midst of the lake ; and a day in his teepee they tarried .</p>
   <p>[ a ] see Hennepin 's account of Aqui-pa-que-tin and his village . Shea 's Hennepin 227 .</p>
   <p>Of the deed in the wilderness spake , to the brave Chief , the frank-hearted Frenchman . A generous man was the Chief and a friend of the fearless explorer ; And dark was his visage with grief at the treacherous act of the warriors . “ Brave Wazi-Kuté is a man , and his heart is as clear as the sun-light ; But the head of a treacherous clan , and a snake in the bush is Tamdóka , ” Said the chief ; and he promised Duluth , on the word of a friend and a warrior , To carry the pipe and the truth to his cousin , the chief at Kathága ; For thrice at the Tânka Medé had he smoked in the lodge of the Frenchman ; And thrice had he carried away the bountiful gifts of the trader .</p>
   <p>When the chief could no longer prevail on the white men to rest in his teepee , He guided their feet on the trail to the lakes of the winding Rice-River . [ a ] Now on speeds the light bark canoe , through the lakes to the broad Gitchee Seebee ; [ b ] And up the great river they row , — up the Big Sandy Lake and Savanna ; And down through the meadows they go to the river of broad Gitchee Gumee . [ c ]</p>
   <p>[ a ] Now called “ Mud River ” — it empties into the Mississippi at Aitkin . [ b ] Gitchee seebee — Big River — the Ojibway name for the Mississippi , which is a corruption of Gitchee Seebee — as Michigan is a corruption of Gitchee Gumee — Great Lake , the Ojibway name of Lake Superior . [ c ] The Ojibways call the St. Louis River Gitchee-Gumee See-bee — Great-lake River , i. e . the river of the Great Lake ( Lake Superior ) .</p>

    <p>DALLES OF THE ST. LOUIS</p>
   </figure>
   <p>Still onward they speed to the Dalles — to the roar of the white-rolling rapids , Where the dark river tumbles and falls down the ragged ravine of the mountains , And singing his wild jubilee to the low-moaning pines and the cedars , Rushes on to the unsalted sea o'er the ledges upheaved by volcanoes . Their luggage the voyageurs bore down the long , winding path of the portage , [ a ] While they mingled their song with the roar of the turbid and turbulent waters . Down-wimpling and murmuring there , twixt two dewy hills winds a streamlet , Like a long , flaxen ringlet of hair on the breast of a maid in her slumber .</p>
   <p>[ a ] The route of Duluth above described — from the mouth of the Wild Rice Mud River to Lake Superior — was for centuries and still is , the Indians ’ canoe route . I have walked over the old portage from the foot of the Dalles to the St. Louis above — trod by the feet of half-breeds and voyageurs for more than two centuries , and by the Indians for , perhaps , a thousand years .</p>
   <p>All safe at the foot of the trail , where they left it , they found their felucca , And soon to the wind spread the sail , and glided at ease through the waters , Through the meadows and lakelets and forth , round the point stretching south like a finger , From the mist-wreathen hill on the north , sloping down to the bay and the lake-side And behold , at the foot of the hill , a cluster of Chippewa wigwams , And the busy wives plying with skill their nets in the emerald waters . Two hundred white winters and more have fled from the face of the Summer Since DuLuth , on that wild , somber shore , in the unbroken forest primeval , From the midst of the spruce and the pines , saw the smoke of the wigwams up-curling , Like the fumes from the temples and shrines of the Druids of old in their forests . Ah , little he dreamed then , forsooth , that a city would stand on that hill-side , And bear the proud name of Duluth , the untiring and dauntless explorer . A refuge for ships from the storms , and for men from the bee-hives of Europe . Out-stretching her long , iron arms o'er an empire of Saxons and Normans .</p>
   <p>The swift west-wind sang in the sails , and on flew the boat like a Sea-Gull , By the green , templed hills and the dales , and the dark rugged rocks of the North Shore ; For the course of the brave Frenchman lay to his fort at the Gáh-mah-na-ték-wáhk ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 83 ]</span>By the shore of the grand Thunder Bay , where the gray rocks loom up into mountains ; Where the Stone Giant sleeps on the Cape , and the god of the storms makes the thunder ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 83 ]</span>And the Makinak<span type="note_anchor">[ 83 ]</span>lifts his huge shape from the breast of the blue-rolling waters , And thence to the south-westward led his course to the Holy Ghost Mission .<span type="note_anchor">[ 84 ]</span>Where the Black Robes , the brave shepherds , fed their wild sheep on the isle Wau-ga-bá-mé .<span type="note_anchor">[ 84 ]</span></p>

     <l n="218">The aged chief opened his ears ;</l>

     <l n="220">But the moans of his child and her tears</l>
     <l n="221">touched the age-softened heart of the father ,</l>
     <l n="222">And he said , “ I am burdened with years ,</l>

     <l n="227">and her own heart shall choose her a husband . ”</l>
     <l n="228">The dark warrior strode from the tee ;</l>
     <l n="229">low-muttering and grim he departed .</l>

   <p>Then forth went Winona . The bow of Ta-té-psin she took and his arrows , And afar o'er the deep , drifted snow , through the forest , she sped on her snow-shoes . Over meadow and ice-covered mere , through the thickets of red oak and hazel , She followed the tracks of the deer , but like phantoms they fled from her vision . From sunrise till sunset she sped ; half-famished she camped in the thicket ; In the cold snow she made her lone bed ; on the buds of the birch [ a ] made her supper . To the dim moon the gray owl preferred , from the tree top , his shrill lamentation , And around her at midnight she heard the dread famine-cries of the gray wolves . In the gloam of the morning again on the trail of the red-deer she followed — All day long through the thickets in vain , for the gray wolves were chasing the roebucks ; And the cold , hungry winds from the plain chased the wolves and the deer and Winona .</p>

   <p>[ a ] Wazíya 's Star is the North Star . [ b ] A strap used in carrying burdens . [ c ] Wolves sometimes attack people at night but rarely if ever in the day time . If they have followed a hunter all night , or “ treed ” him they will skulk away as soon as the sun rises .</p>
   <p>Wazíya 's wild wrath was appeased , and homeward he turned to his teepee ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>O'er the plains and the forest-land breezed , from the Islands of Summer , the South wind . From their dens came the coon and the bear ; o'er the snow through the woodlands they wandered ; On her snow shoes with stout bow and spear on their trails ran the huntress Winona . The coon to his den in the tree , and the bear to his burrow she followed ; A brave , skillful hunter was she , and Ta-té-psin 's lodge laughed with abundance .</p>
   <p>The long winter wanes . On the wings of the spring come the geese and the mallards ; On the bare oak the red-robin sings , and the crocuses peep on the prairies , And the bobolink pipes , but he brings , of the blue-eyed , brave White Chief , no tidings . With the waning of winter , alas , waned the life of the aged Tatépsin ; Ere the blue pansies peeped from the grass , to the Land of the Spirits he journeyed ; Like a babe in its slumber he passed , or the snow from the hill tops in April ; And the dark-eyed Winona , at last , stood alone by the graves of her kindred . When their myriad mouths opened the trees to the sweet dew of heaven and the rain drops , And the April showers fell on the leas , on his mound fell the tears of Winona . Round her drooping form gathered the years and the spirits unseen of her kindred , As low , in the midst of her tears , at the grave of her father she chanted :</p>

   <p>Still hope , like a star in the night gleaming oft through the broken clouds somber , Cheered the heart of Winona , and bright , on her dreams , beamed the face of the Frenchman . As the thought of a loved one and lost , sad and sweet were her thoughts of the White Chief ; In the moon 's mellow light , like a ghost , walked Winona alone by the Ha-ha , Ever wrapped in a dream . Far away — to the land of the sunrise — she wandered ; On the blue rolling Tánka Medé , [ a ] in the midst of her dreams , she beheld him — In his white-winged canoe , like a bird , to the land of Dakotas returning ; And often in fancy she heard the dip of his oars on the river . On the dark waters glimmered the moon , but she saw not the boat of the Frenchman ; On the somber night bugled the loon , but she heard not the song of the boatmen . The moon waxed and waned , but the star of her hope never waned to the setting ; Through her tears she beheld it afar , like a torch on the eastern horizon . “ He will come ,— he is coming , ” she said ; “ he will come , for my White Eagle promised , ” And low to the bare earth the maid bent her ear for the sound of his footsteps . “ He is gone , but his voice in my ear still remains like the voice of the robin ; He is far , but his footsteps I hear ; he is coming ; my White Chief is coming ! ”</p>
   <p>[ a ] Lake Superior ,— The Gitchee Gumee of the Chippewas .</p>
   <p>But the moon waxed and waned . Nevermore will the eyes of Winona behold him . Far away on the dark , rugged shore of the blue Gitchee Gúmee he lingers . No tidings the rising sun brings ; no tidings the star of the evening ; But morning and evening she sings , like a turtle-doe widowed and waiting ;</p>

   <p>But the man-wolf still followed his prey , and the step-mother ruled in the tepee ; Her will must Winona obey , by the custom and law of Dakotas . The gifts to the teepee were brought — the blankets , and beads of the White men , And Winona , the orphaned , was bought by the crafty relentless Tamdóka . In the Spring-time of life , in the flush of the gladsome mid-May days of Summer , When the bobolink sang and the thrush , and the red robin chirped in the branches , To the tent of the brave must she go ; she must kindle the fire in his tepee ; She must sit in the lodge of her foe , as a slave at the feet of her master . Alas for her waiting ! the wings of the East-wind have brought her no tidings ; On the meadow the meadow-lark sings but sad is her song to Winona , For the glad warblers melody brings but the memory of voices departed .</p>

    <head>NOTES</head>
    <p n="1">1 Called in the Dakota tongue “ Hok-sée-win-nâ-pee Wo-hàn-pee ” — Virgins Dance ( or Feast ) .</p>
    <p n="2">2 One of the favorite and most exciting games of the Dakotas is ball-playing . A smooth place on the prairie , or in winter , on a frozen lake or river , is chosen . Each player has a sort of bat , called “ Tâ-kée-cha-psé-cha , ” about thirty two inches long with a hoop at the lower end four or five inches in diameter , interlaced with thongs of deer-skin , forming a sort of pocket . With these bats they catch and throw the ball . Stakes are set as bounds at a considerable distance from the centre on either side . Two parties are then formed , and each chooses a leader or chief . The ball ( Tâ-pa ) is then thrown up half way between the bounds , and the game begins , the contestants contending with their bats for the ball as it falls . When one succeeds in getting it fairly in the pocket of his bat he swings it aloft and throws it as far as he can towards the bound to which his party is working , taking care to send it , if possible , where some of his own side will take it up . Thus the ball is thrown and contended for till one party succeeds in casting it beyond the bound of the opposite party . A hundred players on a side are sometimes engaged in this exciting game . Betting on the result often runs high . Moccasins , pipes , knives , hatchets , blankets , robes and guns are hung on the prize-pole . Not unfrequently horses are staked on the issue , and sometimes even women . Old men and mothers are among the spectators praising their swift-footed sons , and young wives and maidens are there to stimulate their husbands and lovers . This game is not confined to the warriors , but is also a favorite amusement of the Dakota maidens who generally play for prizes offered by the chief or warriors . See Neill 's Hist . Minn. pp 74-5 ; Riggs ’ “ Tâkoo Wakân , ” pp 44-5 , and Mrs Eastman 's Dacotah , p 55 .</p>
    <p n="3">3 Pronounced Wah-zeé-yah . The god of the North , or Winter . A fabled spirit who dwells in the frozen North , in a great teepee of ice and snow . From his mouth and nostrils he blows the cold blasts of winter . He and “ I-tó-ka-ga Wi-câs-ta ” — the spirit or god of the South ( literally the “ South Man ” ) , are inveterate enemies , and always on the war-path against each other . In winter Wa-zí-ya advances southward and drives “ I-tó-ka-ga Wi-câs-ta ” before him to the Summer-Islands . But in Spring the god of the South , having renewed his youth and strength , in the “ Happy Hunting Grounds , ” is able to drive Wa-zí-ya back again to his icy wigwam in the North . Some Dakotas say that the numerous granite boulders , scattered over the prairies of Minnesota and Dakota , were hurled in battle by Wa-zí-ya from his home in the North at “ I-tó-ka-ga Wi-câs-ta . ” The Wa-zí-ya of the Dakotas is substantially the name as “ Ka-be-bón-ik-ka ” — the “ Winter-maker ” of the Ojibways .</p>
    <p n="4">4 Mendota — ( meeting of the waters ) at the confluence of the Mississippi and Minnesota rivers . See view of the valley  front cut . The true Dakota word is Mdó tè — applied to the mouth of a river flowing into another ,— also to the outlet of a lake .</p>
    <p n="5">5 Pronounced Wee-wâh-stay ; literally — a beautiful virgin , or woman .</p>
    <p n="6">6 Cetân-wa-ká-wa-mâni — “ He who shoots pigeon-hawks walking ” — was the full Dakota name of the grandfather of the celebrated “ Little Crow ” ( Ta-ó-ya-te-dú-ta .— His Red People ) who led his warriors in the terrible outbreak in Minnesota in 1862-3 . The Chippewas called the grandfather “ Kâ-kâ-keé ” — crow or raven — from his war-badge , a crow-skin ; and hence the French traders and courriers du bois called him “ Petit Corbeau ” — Little Crow . This sobriquet , of which he was proud , descended to his son , Wakínyan Tânka — Big Thunder , who succeeded him as chief ; and from Big Thunder to his son Ta-ó-ya-te-dú-ta , who became chief on the death of Wakínyan Tânka . These several “ Little Crows ” were successively Chiefs of the Light-foot , or Kapóza band of Dakotas . Kapóza , the principal village of this band , was originally located on the east bank of the Mississippi near the site of the city of St. Paul . Col. Minn. Hist . Soc ., 1864 , p. 29 . It was in later years moved to the west bank . The grandfather , whom I , for short , call Wakâwa , died the death of a brave in battle against the Ojibways ( commonly called Chippewas ) — the hereditary enemies of the Dakotas . Wakínyan Tânka .— Big Thunder , was killed by the accidental discharge of his own gun . They were both buried with their kindred near the “ Wakan Teepee , ” the sacred Cave — ( Carver 's Cave ) . Ta-ó-ya-te-dú-ta , the last of the Little Crows , was killed July 3 , 1863 , near Hutchinson , Minnesota , by one Lamson , and his bones were duly “ done up ” for the Historical Society of Minnesota . For a part of the foregoing information I am indebted to Gen. H. H. Sibley . See Heard 's Hist . Sioux War , and Neill 's Hist . Minnesota , Third Edition .</p>
    <p n="7">7 Hârps-te-nâh . The first-born daughter of a Dakota is called Winona ; the second , Hârpen ; the third , Hârpstinâ ; the fourth . Wâska ; the fifth , Wehârka . The first born son is called Chaskè ; the second , Hârpam ; the third , Hapéda ; the fourth , Châtun ; the fifth , Hârka . They retain these names till others are given them on account of some action , peculiarity , etc . The females often retain their child-names through life .</p>
    <p n="8">8 Wah-pah-sâh was the hereditary name of a long and illustrious lineof Dakota Chiefs . Wabashaw is a corrupt pronounciation . The name is a contraction of “ Wâ-pa-hâ-sa , ” which is from “ Wâ-ha-pa , ” the standard or pole used in the Dakota dances , and upon which feathers of various colors are tied , and not from “ Wâ-pa ” — leaf or leaves , as has been generally supposed . Therefore Wâpasa means the Standard — and not the “ Leaf-Shaker , ” as many writers have it . The principal village of these hereditary Chiefs was Ke-úk-sa , or Ke-ó-sa ,— where now stands the fair city of Winona . Ke-úk-sa signifies — The village of law-breakers ; so-called because this band broke the law or custom of the Dakotas against marrying blood relatives of any degree . I get this information from Rev . Stephen R. Riggs , author of the Dakota Grammar and Dictionary , “ Takoo Wakan , ” etc . Wapasa , grandfather of the last Chief of that name , and a contemporary of Cetan-Wa-kâ-wa-mâni , was a noted Chief , and a friend of the British in the war of the Revolution . Neill 's Hist . Minn ., pp . 225-9 .</p>
    <p n="9">9 E-hó , E-tó — Exclamations of surprise and delight .</p>
    <p n="10">10 Mah-gâh — The wild-goose .</p>
    <p n="11">11 Teé-peé — A lodge or wigwam , often contracted to “ tee . ”</p>
    <p n="12">12 Pronounced Mahr-peé-yah-doó-tah — literally , Cloud Red .</p>
    <p n="13">13 Pronounced Wahnmdeé — The War-Eagle . Each feather worn by a warrior represents an enemy slain or captured — man , woman or child ; but the Dakotas , before they became desperate under the cruel warfare of their enemies , generally spared the lives of their captives , and never killed women or infants , except in rare instances , under the lex talionis . Neill 's Hist . Minn ., p. 112 .</p>
    <p n="14">14 Mah-tó — The polar bear — ursus maritimus . The Dakotas say that , in olden times , white bears were often found about Rainy Lake and the Lake of the Woods , in winter , and sometimes as far south as the mouth of the Minnesota . They say one was once killed at White Bear Lake ( but a few miles from St. Paul and Minneapolis ) , and they therefore named the lake Medé Mató — White Bear Lake .</p>
    <p n="15">15 The Hó-hé ( Hó-hây ) are the Assiniboins or “ Stone-roasters . ” Their home is the region of the Assiniboin river in British America . They speak the Dakota tongue , and originally were a band of that nation . Tradition says a Dakota “ Helen ” was the cause of the separation and a bloody feud that lasted for many years . The Hohés are called “ Stone roasters , ” because , until recently at least , they used “ Wa-ta-pe ” kettles and vessels made of birch bark in which they cooked their food . They boiled water in these vessels by heating stones and putting them in the water . The “ wa-ta-pe ” kettle is made of the fibrous roots of the white cedar , interlaced and tightly woven . When the vessel is soaked it becomes watertight . [ Snelling 's ] Tales of the North west , p 21 . Mackenzie 's Travels .</p>
    <p n="16">16 Hey-ó-ka is one of the principal Dakota deities . He is a Giant , but can change himself into a buffalo , a bear , a fish or a bird . He is called the Anti-natural God or Spirit . In summer he shivers with cold , in winter he suffers from heat ; he cries when he laughs and he laughs when he cries , &amp; c. He is the reverse of nature in all things . Heyóka is universally feared and reverenced by the Dakotas , but so severe is the ordeal that the Heyóka Wacípee ( the dance to Heyóka ) is now rarely celebrated . It is said that the “ Medicine-men ” use a secret preparation which enables them to handle fire and dip their hands in boiling water without injury , and thereby gain great eclat from the uninitiated . The chiefs and the leading warriors usually belong to the secret order of “ Medicine-men , ” or “ Sons of Unktéhee ” — the Spirit of the Waters .</p>
    <p n="17">17 The Dakota name for the moon is Han-yé-tu-wee — literally , Night-Sun . He is the twin brother of An-pé-tu-wee — the Day Sun . See note 70 .</p>
    <p n="18">18 The Dakotas believe that the stars are the spirits of their departed friends .</p>
    <p n="19">19 Tee — Contracted from teepee , lodge or wigwam , and means the same .</p>
    <p n="20">20 For all their sacred feasts the Dakotas kindle a new fire called “ The Virgin Fire . ” This is done with flint and steel , or by rubbing together pieces of wood till friction produces fire . It must be done by a virgin , nor must any woman , except a virgin , ever touch the “ sacred armor ” of a Dakota warrior . White cedar is “ Wakân ” — sacred . See note 50 . Riggs ’ “ Tahkoo Wakân , ” p. 84 .</p>
    <p n="21">21 All Northern Indians consider the East a mysterious and sacred land whence comes the sun . The Dakota name for the East is Wee-yo-heé-yan-pa — the sunrise . The Ojibways call it Waub-ó-nong — the white land or land of light , and they have many myths , legends and traditions relating thereto . Barbarous peoples of all times have regarded the East with superstitious reverence , simply because the sun rises in that quarter .</p>
    <p n="22">22 See Mrs. Eastman 's Dacotah , pp . 225-8 , describing the feast to Heyóka .</p>
    <p n="23">23 This stone from which the Dakotas have made their pipes for ages , is esteemed “ wakân ” — sacred . They call it I-yân-ska , probably from “ íya , ” to speak , and “ ska , ” white , truthful , peaceful ,— hence , peace-pipe , herald of peace , pledge of truth , etc . In the cabinet at Albany , N. Y ., there is a very ancient pipe of this material which the Iroquois obtained from the Dakotas . Charlevoix speaks of this pipe-stone in his History of New France . LeSueur refers to the Yanktons as the village of the Dakotas at the Red-Stone Quarry , See Neill 's Hist . Minn ., p. 514 .</p>
    <p n="24">24 “ Ho ” is an exclamation of approval  - yea , yes , bravo .</p>
    <p n="25">25 Buying is the honorable way of taking a wife among the Dakotas . The proposed husband usually gives a horse or its , value in other articles to the father or natural guardian of the woman selected — sometimes against her will . See note 75 .</p>
    <p n="26">26 The Dakotas believe that the Aurora Borealis is an evil omen and the threatening of an evil spirit , ( perhaps Wazíya , the Winter-god — some say a witch , or a very ugly old woman ) . When the lights appear , danger threatens , and the warriors shoot at , and often slay , the evil spirit , but it rises from the dead again .</p>
    <p n="27">27 Se-só-kah — The Robin .</p>
    <p n="28">28 The spirit of Anpétu-sâpa that haunts the Falls of St. Anthony with her dead babe in her arms . See the Legend in Neill 's Hist . Minn ., or my “ Legend of the Falls . ”</p>
    <p n="29">29 Mee-coónk-shee — My daughter .</p>
    <p n="30">30 The Dakotas call the meteor , “ Wakân-denda ” ( sacred fire ) and Wakân-wohlpa ( sacred gift . ) Meteors are messengers from the Land of Spirits , warning of impending danger . It is a curious fact that the “ sacred stone ” of the Mohammedans , in the Kaaba at Mecca , is a meteoric stone , and obtains its sacred character from the fact that it fell from heaven . 31 Kah-nó-te-dahn — The little , mysterious dweller in the woods . This spirit lives in the forest in hollow trees . Mrs. Eastman 's Dacotah , Pre . Rem . xxxi . “ The Dakota god of the woods — an unknown animal said to resemble a man , which the Dakotas worship ; perhaps , the monkey . ” Riggs ’ Dakota Dic . Tit — Canotidan .</p>
    <p n="31">32 The Dakotas believe that thunder is produced by the flapping of the wings of an immense bird which they call Wakínyan — the Thunder-bird . Near the source of the Minnesota River is a place called “ Thunder-Tracks ” where the foot-prints of a “ Thunder-bird ” are seen on the rocks twenty-five miles apart . Mrs. Eastman 's Dacotah , p. 71 . There are many Thunder-birds . The father of all the Thunder-birds — “ Wakínyan Tanka ” — or “ Big Thunder , ” has his teepee on a lofty mountain in the far West . His teepee has four openings , at each of which is a sentinel ; at the east , a butterfly ; at the west , a bear ; at the south , a red deer ; at the north , a caribou . He has a bitter enmity against Unktéhee ( god of waters ) and often shoots his fiery arrows at him , and hits the earth , trees , rocks , and sometimes men . Wakínyan created wild-rice , the bow and arrow , the tomahawk and the spear . He is a great war-spirit , and Wanmdée ( the war-eagle ) is his messenger . A Thunder-bird ( say the Dakotas ) was once killed near Kapóza by the son of Cetan-Wakawa-mâni , and he there upon took the name of “ Wakínyan Tanka ” — “ Big Thunder . ”</p>
    <p n="32">33 Pronounced Tah-tâhn-kah — Bison or Buffalo .</p>
    <p n="33">34 Enâh — An exclamation of wonder . Ehó — Behold ! see there !</p>
    <p n="34">35 The Crees are the Knisteneaux of Alexander Mackenzie . See his account of them , Mackenzie 's Travels , ( London 1801 ) p. xci . to cvii .</p>
    <p n="35">36 Lake Superior . The only names the Dakotas have for Lake Superior are Medé Tânka or Tânka Medé — Great Lake , and Me-ne-yâ-ta — literally , At-the-Water .</p>
    <p n="36">37 April — Literally , the moon when the geese lay eggs . See note 71 .</p>
    <p n="37">38 Carver 's Cave at St. Paul was called by the Dakotas “ Wakân Teepee ” — sacred lodge . In the days that are no more , they lighted their Council-fires in this cave , and buried their dead near it . See Neill 's Hist . Minn ., p. 207 . Capt . Carver in his Travels , London , 1778 , p. 63 , et seq ., describes this cave as follows : “ It is a remarkable cave of an amazing depth . The Indians term it Wakon-teebe , that is , the Dwelling of the Great Spirit . The entrance into it is about ten feet wide , the height of it five feet , the arch within is near fifteen feet high and about thirty feet broad . The bottom of it consists of fine clear sand . About twenty feet from the entrance begins a lake , the water of which is transparent , and extends to an unsearchable distance ; for the darkness of the cave prevents all attempts to acquire a knowledge of it . I threw a small pebble towards the interior parts of it with my utmost strength . I could hear that it fell into the water , and notwithstanding it was of so small a size , it caused an astonishing and horrible noise that reverberated through all those gloomy regions . I found in this cave many Indian hieroglyphics , which appeared very ancient , for time had nearly covered them with moss , so that it was with difficulty I could trace them . They were cut in a rude manner upon the inside of the walls , which were composed of a stone so extremely soft that it might be easily penetrated with a knife : a stone everywhere to be found near the Mississippi . This cave is only accessible by ascending a narrow , steep passage that lies near the brink of the river . At a little distance from this dreary cavern is the burying-place of several bands of the Naudowessie ( Dakota ) Indians . ” Many years ago the roof fell in , but the cave has been partially restored and is now used as a beer cellar .</p>
    <p n="38">39 Wah-kahn-dee — The lightning .</p>
    <p n="39">40 The Bloody River — the Red River was so-called on account of the numerous Indian battles that have been fought on its banks . The Chippewas say that its waters were colored red by the blood of many warriors slain on its banks in the fierce wars between themselves and the Dakotas .</p>
    <p n="40">41 Tah — The Moose . This is the root-word for all ruminating animals ; Ta-tânka , buffalo  - Ta-tóka mountain antelope — Ta-hinca , the red-deer — Ta-mdóka , the buck deer  - Ta-hinca-ska , white deer ( sheep ) .</p>
    <p n="41">42 Hogâhn — Fish . Red Hogan , the trout .</p>
    <p n="42">43 Tipsânna ( often called tipsinna ) is a wild prairie turnip used for food by the Dakotas . It grows on high , dry land , and increases from year to year . It is eaten both cooked and raw .</p>
    <p n="43">44 Rio Tajo , ( or Tagus ) , a river of Spain and Portugal .</p>
    <p n="44">45 “ * * * * Bees of Trebizond — Which from the sunniest flowers that glad With their pure smile the gardens round , Draw venom forth that drives men mad . ”</p>
    <p n="45">— Thomas Moore</p>
    <p n="46">46 Skeé-skah — The Wood duck .</p>
    <p n="47">47 The Crocus . I have seen the prairies in Minnesota spangled with these beautiful flowers in various colors before the ground was entirely free from frost . The Datotas call them frost-flowers .</p>
    <p n="48">48 The “ Sacred Ring ” around the feast of the Virgins is formed by armed warriors sitting , and none but a virgin must enter this ring . The warrior who knows is bound on honor , and by old and sacred custom , to expose and publicly denounce any tarnished maiden who dares to enter this ring , and his word cannot be questioned — even by the chief . See Mrs Eastman 's Dacotah , p. 64 .</p>
    <p n="49">49 Prairie 's Pride .— This annual shrub , which abounds on many of the sandy prairies in Minnesota , is sometimes called “ tea-plant , ” “ sage-plant , ” and “ red-root willow . ” I doubt if it has any botanic name . Its long plumes of purple and gold are truly the “ pride of the prairies . ”</p>
    <p n="50">50 The Dakotas consider white cedar “ Wakân , ” ( sacred ) . They use sprigs of it at their feasts , and often burn it to destroy the power of evil spirits . Mrs Eastman 's Dacotah , p. 210 .</p>
    <p n="51">51 Tâhkoo-skahng-skang .— This deity is supposed to be invisible , yet everywhere present ; he is an avenger and a searcher of hearts . ( Neill 's Hist . Minn ., p . 57 . ) I suspect he was the chief spirit of the Dakotas before the missionaries imported “ Wakan Tânka ” — ( Great Spirit ) .</p>
    <p n="52">52 The Dakotas believe in “ were-wolves ” as firmly as did our Saxon ancestors , and for similar reasons — the howl of the wolf being often imitated as a decoy or signal by their enemies , the Ojibways .</p>
    <p n="53">53 Shee-shó-kah — The Robin .</p>
    <p n="54">54 The Dakotas cail the Evening Star the “ Virgin Star , ” and believe it to be the spirit of the virgin wronged at the feast .</p>
    <p n="55">55 Mille Lacs . This lake was discovered by DuLuth , and by him named Lac Buade , in honor of Governor Frontenac of Canada , whose familyname was Buade . The Dakota name for it is Mdé Waksân — Spirit Lake .</p>
    <p n="56">56 The Ojibways imitate the hoot of the owl and the howl of the wolf to perfection , and often use these cries as signals to each other in war and the chase .</p>
    <p n="57">57 The Dakotas called the Ojibways the “ Snakes of the Forest , ” on account of their lying in ambush for their enemies .</p>
    <p n="58">58 Strawberries .</p>
    <p n="59">59 Seé-yo — The Prairie-hen .</p>
    <p n="60">60 Mahgâh — The Wild-goose . Fox-pups . I could never see the propriety of calling the young of foxes kits or kittens , which mean little cats . The fox belongs to the canis , or dog family and not the felis , or cat family . If it is proper to call the young of dogs and wolves pups , it is equally proper to so call the young of foxes .</p>
    <p n="61">61 When a Dakota is sick , he thinks the spirit of an enemy or some animal has entered into his body , and the principal business of the “ medicine man ” — Wicasta Wakan — is to cast out the “ unclean spirit , ” with incantations and charms . See Neill 's Hist . Minn ., pp . 66 — 8 . The Jews entertained a similar belief in the days of Jesus of Nazareth .</p>
    <p n="62">62 Wah-zeé-yah 's star — The North-star . See note 3 .</p>
    <p n="63">63 The Dakotas , like our forefathers and all other barbarians , believe in witches and witchcraft .</p>
    <p n="64">64 The Medó is a wild potato , it resembles the sweet potato in top and taste . It grows in bottom-lands , and is much prized by the Dakotas for food . The “ Dakota Friend , ” for December , 1850 .</p>
    <p n="65">65 The meteor — Wakân denda — Sacred fire .</p>
    <p n="66">66 Meetâhwin — My bride .</p>
    <p n="67">67 Stoke — The body of a tree . This is an old English word of Saxon origin , now changed to stock .</p>
    <p n="68">68 The Via Lactea or Milky Way . The Dakotas call it Wanagee-Tach-anku — The path-way of the spirits and believe that over this path the spirits of the dead pass to the Spirit-land . See Riggs ’ Tah-koo Wah-kan , p. 101 .</p>
    <p n="69">69 Oonk-táy-hee — There are many Unktéhees , children of the Great Unktéhee , who created the earth and man and who formerly dwelt in a vast cavern under the Falls of St. Anthony . The Unktéhee sometimes reveals himself in the form of a huge buffalo-bull . From him proceed invisible influences . The Great Unktéhee created the earth . “ Assembling in grand conclave all the aquatic tribes he ordered them to bring up dirt from beneath the waters , and proclaimed death to the disobedient . The beaver and otter forfeited their lives . At last the muskrat went beneath the waters , and , after a long time appeared at the surface , nearly exhausted , with some dirt . From this , Unktéhee fashioned the earth into a large circular plain . The earth being finished , he took a deity , one of his own offspring , and grinding him to powder , sprinkled it upon the earth , and this produced many worms . The worms were then collected and scattered again . They matured into infants and these were then collected and scattered and became full-grown Dakotas . The bones of the mastodon , the Dakotas think , are the bones of Unktéhees , and they preserve the with the greatest care in the medicine bag . ” Neill 's Hist . Minn ., p. 55 . The Unktéhees and the Thunder-birds are perpetually it war . There are various accounts of the creation of man . Some say that at the bidding of the Great Unktéhee , men sprang full grown from the caverns of the earth . See Riggs ’ “ Tah-koo Wah-kân , ” and Mrs Eastman 's Dacotah . The Great Unktéhee and the Great Thunder-bird had a terrible battle in the bowels of the earth to determine which should be the ruler of the world . See description in Legend of Winona .</p>
    <p n="70">70 Prononced Ahng-pay-too-wee — The Sun ; literally the Day Sun , thus distinguishing him from Han-yé-tuwee ( Hahng-yay-too-wee ) the night sun , ( the moon ) . They are twin brothers but Anpétuwee is the more powerful Han-yé-tuwee receives his power from his brother and obeys him . He watches over the earth while the Sun sleeps . The Dakotas believe the sun is the father of life . Unlike the most of their other gods , he is beneficent and kind ; yet they worship him ( in the sun-dance ) in the most dreadful manner . See Riggs ’ “ Tah-koo Wah-kân , ” pp . 81-2 , and Catlin 's Riggs ’ “ Okee-pa . ” The moon is worshipped as the representative of the sun ; and in the great Sun-dance , which is usually held in the full of the moon , when the moon rises the dancers turn their eyes on her ( or him ) . Anpétuwee issues every morning from the lodge of Han-nan-na ( the Morning ) and begins his journey over the sky to his lodge in the land of shadows . Sometimes he walks over on the Bridge ( or path ) of the Spirits — Wanâgee Ta-chan-ku ,— and sometimes he sails over the sea of the skies in his shining canoe ; but somehow , and the Dakotas do not explain how , he gets back again to the lodge of Hannanna in time to take a nap and eat his breakfast before starting anew on his journey . The Dakotas swear by the sun . “ As Anpé-tu-wee hears me , this is true ! ” They call him Father and pray to him — “ Wakan ! Ate , on-she-ma-da . ” “ Sacred Spirit ,— Father , have mercy on me . ” As the Sun is the father , so they believe the Earth is the mother , of life . Truly there is much philosophy in the Dakota mythology . The Algonkins call the earth “ Me-suk-kum-mik-o-kwa ” — the great-grandmother of all . Narrative of John Tanner , p. 193 .</p>
    <p n="71">71 The Dakotas reckon their months by moon . They name their moons from natural circumstances . They correspond very nearly with our months , as follows :</p>
    <p n="72">January — Wee-té-rhee — The Hard Moon , i. e .— the cold moon .</p>
    <p n="73">February — Wee-câ-ta-wee — The Coon Moon .</p>
    <p n="74">March — Istâ-wee-ca-ya-zang-wee — the sore eyes moon ( from snow blindness . )</p>
    <p n="75">April — Magâ-okâ-da-wee — the moon when the geese lay eggs ; also called Wokâda-wee — egg-moon , and sometimes Wató-papee-wee , the canoe moon , or moon when the streams become free from ice .</p>
    <p n="76">May — Wó-zu-pee-wee — the planting moon .</p>
    <p n="77">June — Wazú-ste-ca-sa-wee — the strawberry moon</p>
    <p n="78">July — Wa-sun-pa-wee — moon when the geese shed their feathers , also called Chang-pâ-sapa-wee — Choke-Cherry moon , and sometimes — Mna-rchâ-rhca-wee — “ The moon of the red blooming lilies ” , literally , the red-lily moon .</p>
    <p n="79">August — Wasú-ton-wee — the ripe moon , i. e . Harvest Moon .</p>
    <p n="80">September — Psin-na-ké-tu-wee — the ripe rice moon .</p>
    <p n="81">October — Wà-zu-pee-wee or Wee-wa-zú-pee — the moon when wild rice is gathered and laid up for winter .</p>
    <p n="82">November — Ta-kee-yu-hrâ-wee — the deer-rutting moon .</p>
    <p n="83">December — Ta-hé-cha-psung-wee — the moon when deer shed their horns .</p>
    <p n="84">72 Oonk-tó-mee — is a “ bad spirit ” in the form of a monstrous black spider . He inhabits fens and marshes and lies in wait for his prey . At night he often lights a torch ( evidently the ignis fatuus or Jack-a-lantern ) and swings it on the marshes to decoy the unwary into his toils .</p>
    <p n="85">73 The Dakotas have their stone idol , or god , called Toon-kan — or In-yan . This god dwells in stone or rocks and is they say , the oldest god of all — he is grandfather of all living things . I think , however that the stone is merely the symbol of the everlasting , all pervading , invisible Ta-ku Wa-kan — the essence of all life ,— pervading all nature , animate and inanimate . The Rev . S. R. Riggs who , for forty years , has been a student of Dakota customs , superstitions etc ., says , “ Tâhkoo Wahkan , ” p. 55 et seq . “ The religious faith of the Dakota is not in his gods as such . It is in an intangible , mysterious something of which they are only the embodiment , and that in such measure and degree as may accord with the individual fancy of the worshipper . Each one will worship some of these divinities , and neglect or despise others , but the great object of all their worship , whatever its chosen medium , is the Ta-koo Wa-kan , which is the supernatural and mysterious . No one term can express the full meaning of the Dakotas Wakan . It comprehends all mystery , secret power and divinity . Awe and reverence are its due , and it is as unlimited in manifestation as it is in idea . All life is Wakan ; so also is everything which exhibits power , whether in action as the winds and drifting clouds ; or in passive endurance , as the boulder by the wayside . For even the commonest sticks and stones have a spiritual essence which must be reverenced as a manifestation of the all-pervading mysterious power that fills the the universe . ”</p>
    <p n="86">74 Wazi-kuté — Wah-ze-koo-tay ; literally — Pine-shooter — he that shoots among the pines . When Father Hennepin was at Mille Lacs in 1679-80 , Wazi-kuté was the head Chief ( Itâncan ) of the band of Isantees . Hennepin writes his name  Ouasicoudé and translates it — the “ Pierced Pine . ” See Shea 's Hennepin p. 234 , Minn. Hist . Coll . vol . I. p. 316 .</p>
    <p n="87">75 When a Dakota brave wishes to “ propose ” to a “ dusky maid ” , he visits her teepee at night after she has retired , or rather , laid down in her robe to sleep . He lights a splinter of wood and holds it to her face . If she blows out the light , he is accepted ; if she covers her head and leaves it burning , he is rejected . The rejection however is not considered final till it has been thrice repeated . Even then the maiden is often bought of her parents or guardian , and forced to become the wife of the rejected suitor . If she accepts the proposal , still the suitor must buy her of her parents with suitable gifts .</p>
    <p n="88">76 The Dakotas called the Falls of St. Anthony the Ha-Ha — the loud laughing , or roaring . The Mississippi River they called Ha-Ha Wá-kpa — River of the Falls . The Ojibway name for the Falls is Ka-ká-bih-kúng . Minnehaha is a combination of two Dakota words — Mini — water and Ha-Ha — Falls ; but it is not the name by which the Dakotas designated that cataract . Some authorities say they called it I-ha-ha pronounced E-rhah-rhah — lightly laughing . Rev . S. W. Pond , whose long residence as a missionary among the Dakotas in this immediate vicinity makes him an authority that can hardly be questioned , says “ they called the Falls of Minnehaha “ Mini-i-hrpâ-ya dan , ” and it had no other name in Dakota . It means Little Falls and nothing else . ” Letter to the author .</p>
    <p n="89">77 The game of the Plum-stones is one of the favorite games of the Dakotas . Hennepin was the first to describe this game in his “ Description de la Louisiane , ” Paris , 1683 , and he describes it very accurately . See Shea 's translation p. 301 . The Dakotas call this game Kan-soo Koo tay-pe — shooting plum-stones . Each stone is painted black on one side and red on the other ; on one side they grave certain figures which make the stones “ Wakan . ” They are placed in a dish and thrown up like dice ; indeed the game is virtually a game of dice . Hennepin says : “ There are some so given to this game that they will gamble away even their great coat . Those who conduct the game cry at the top of their voices when they rattle the platter and they strike their shoulders so hard as to leave them all black with the blows . ”</p>
    <p n="90">78 Wa'tanka — contraction of Wa-kan Tanka — Great Spirit . The Dakotas had no Wakan Tanka — or Wakan-péta — fire spirit — till whitemen imported them . There being no name for the Supreme Being in the Dakota tongue ( except Tá-ku Wakan — See note 73 ) — and all their gods and spirits being Wakan — the missionaries named God in Dakota — “ Wakan Tanka ” — which means Big Spirit , or The Big Mysterious .</p>
    <p n="91">79 The Dakotas called Lake Calhoun — Mdé-mdó-za — Loon Lake . They also called it — Re-ya-ta-mde — the lake back from the river . They called Lake Harriet — Mdé-únma — the other lake — or ( perhaps ) Mdé úma  Hazel-nut Lake . The lake nearest Calhoun on the north — Lake of the Isles — they called Wí-ta Mdé — Island-Lake . Lake Minnetonka they called Me-me-a-tán-ka — Broad Water .</p>
    <p n="92">80 The animal called by the French voyageurs the cabri ( the kid ) is found only on the prairies . It is of the goat kind , smaller than a deer , and so swift that neither horse nor dog can overtake it . ( Snelling 's ) “ Tales of the Northwest , ” p. 286. note 15 . It is the gazelle , or prairie antelope , called by the Dakotas Tato-ka-dan — little antelope . It is the Pish-tah-te-koosh of the Algonkin tribes , “ reckoned the fleetest animal in the prairie country about the Assinneboin . ” Captivity and Adventures of John Tanner , p. 301 .</p>
    <p n="93">81 The Wicâstâpi Wakânpi ( literally , men supernatural ) are the “ Medicine-men ” or Magicians of the Dakotas . They call themselves the sons , or disciples of Unktéhee . In their rites , ceremonies , tricks and pretensions they closely resemble the Dactyli , Idæ and Curetes of the ancient Greeks and Romans , the Magi of the Persians , and the Druids of Britain . Their pretended intercourse with spirits , their powers of magic and divination , and their rites are substantially the same , and point unmistakably to a common origin . The Dakota “ Medicine-Man ” can do the “ rope-trick ” of the Hindoo magician to perfection . The teepee used for the Wakan Wacipee — or Sacred Dance — is called the Wakan Teepee — the Sacred Teepee . Carver 's Cave at St. Paul was also called Wakan Teepee , because the Medicine-men or magicians often held their dances and feasts in it . For a full account of the rites , etc ., see Riggs ’ “ Tâhkoo Wahkan ” , Chapter VI . The Ta-sha-ke — literally , “ Deer-hoofs ” — is a rattle made by hanging the hard segments of deer-hoofs to a wooden rod a foot long — about an inch in diameter at the handle end , and tapering to a point at the other . The clashing of these horny bits makes a sharp , shrill sound something like distant sleigh-bells . In their incantations over the sick they sometimes use the gourd-shell rattle .</p>
    <p n="94">The Chân-che-ga — is a drum or “ Wooden Kettle . ” The hoop of the drum is from a foot to eighteen inches in diameter , and from three to ten inches deep . The skin covering is stretched over one end making a drum with one end only . The magical drum sticks are ornamented with down , and heads of birds or animals are carved on them . This makes them Wakan .</p>
    <p n="95">The flute called Cho-tanka ( big pith ) is of two varieties — one made of sumac , the pith of which is punched out , etc . The second variety is made of the long bone of the wing or thigh of the swan or crane . They call the first the bubbling chotanka from the tremulous note it gives when blown with all the holes stopped . Riggs ’ Tahkoo Wahkan , p. 476 , et seq .</p>
    <p n="96">E-né-pee — vapor bath is used as a purification preparatory to the sacred feasts . The vapor bath is taken in this way : “ A number of poles the size of hoop-poles or less are taken , and their larger ends being set in the ground in a circle , the flexible tops are bent over and tied in the centre . This frame work is then covered with robes and blankets , a small hole being left on one side for an entrance . Before the door a fire is built , and round stones about the size of a man 's head are heated in it . When hot , they are rolled within , and the door being closed , steam is made by pouring water on them . The devotee , stripped to the skin , sits within this steam-tight dome , sweating profusely at every pore , until he is nearly suffocated . Sometimes a number engage in it together and unite their prayers and songs . ” “ Tâhkoo Wakan , ” p. 83 . Father Hennepin was subjected to the vapour-bath at Mille Lacs by Chief Aqui-pa-que-tin , two hundred years ago . After describing the method Hennepin says : “ When he had made me sweat thus three times in a week , I felt as strong as ever . ” Shea 's Hennepin , p. 228 . For a very full and accurate account of the Medicine men of the Dakotas , and their rites etc ., see Chap . II , Neill 's Hist . Minnesota .</p>
    <p n="97">82 The sacred O-zu-ha — or Medicine-sack must be made of the skin of the otter , the coon , the weasel , the squirrel , the loon , a certain kind of fish or the skins of serpents . It must contain four kinds of medicine ( or magic ) representing birds , beasts , herbs and trees , viz : The down of the female swan colored red , the roots of certain grasses , bark from the roots of cedar trees , and hair of the buffalo . “ From this combination proceeds a Wakân influence so powerful that no human being unassisted can resist it . ” Wonderful indeed must be the magic power of these Dakota Druids to lead such a man aa the Rev . S. R. Riggs to say of them : “ By great shrewdness , untiring industry , and more or less of actual demoniacal possession , they convince great numbers of their fellows , and in the process are convinced themselves , of their sacred character and office . ” Tahkoo Wakân , pp . 88-9</p>
    <p n="98">83 Gâh-ma-na-tek-wâhk — the river of many falls — is the Ojibway name of the river commonly called Kaministiguia , near the mouth of which is situate Fort William , on the site of DuLuth 's old fort . The view on Thunder-Bay is one of the grandest in America . Thunder-Cap , with its sleeping stone-giant , looms up into the heavens . Here Ka-be-bon-ikka — the Ojibway 's god of storms , flaps his huge wings and makes the Thunder . From this mountain he sends forth the rain , the snow , the hail , the lightning and the tempest . A vast giant , turned to stone by his magic , lies asleep at his feet . The island called by the Ojibways the Mak-i-nak ( the turtle ) from its tortoise-like shape , lifts its huge form in the distance . Some “ down-east ” Yankee , called it “ Pie-Island , ” from its ( to his hungry imagination ) fancied resemblance to a pumpkin pie , and the name , like all bad names , sticks . McKay 's Mountain on the main-land , a perpendicular rock more than a thousand feet high , up-heaved by the throes of some vast volcano , and numerous other bold and precipitous head lands , and rock-built islands , around which roll the sapphire-blue waters of the fathomless bay , present some of the most magnificent views to be found on either continent .</p>
    <p n="99">84 The Mission of the Holy Ghost — at La Pointe on the isle Waug-a-bá-me — ( winding view ) in the beautiful bay of Cha-quam-egon  was founded by the Jesuits about the year 1660 , and Father Renè Menard was the first priest at this point . After he was lost in the wilderness , Father Glaude Allouëz permanently established ihe mission in 1665 . The famous Father Marquette , who took Allouëz 's place , Sept. 13 . 1669 , writing to his Superior , thus describes the Dakotas : “ The Nadouessi are the Iroquois of this country , beyond La Pointe , but less faithless , and never attack till attacked . Their language is entirely different from the Huron and Algonquin . They have many villages , but are widely scattered . They have very extraordinary customs . They principally use the calumet . They do not speak at great feasts , and when a stranger arrives give him to eat of a wooden fork , as we would a child . All the lake tribes make war on them , but with small success . They have false oats , ( wild rice ) use little canoes , and keep their word strictly . ” Neill 's Hist . Minn ., p. 111 .</p>
    <p n="100">85 Michâbo — the Good , Great Spirit of the Algonkins . In Autumn , in the moon of the falling leaf , ere he composes himself to his winter 's sleep , he fills his great pipe and takes a god-like smoke . The balmy clouds from his pipe float over the hills and woodland , filling the air with the haze of “ Indian Summer . ” Brinton 's Myths of the New World , p. 163 .</p>
    <p n="101">86 Pronounced Kah-thah-gah — literally , the place of waves and foam . This was the principal village of the Isantee band of Dakotas two hundred years ago , and was located at the Falls of St. Anthony , which the Dakotas called the Ha-ha — pronounced Rhah-rhah — the loud , laughing waters . The Dakotas believed that the Falls were in the centre of the earth . Here dwelt the Great Unktéhee , the creator of the earth and man ; and from this place a path led to the Spirit-land . DuLuth undoubtedly visited Kathága in the year 1679 . In his “ Memoir ” ( Archives of the Ministry of the Marine ) addressed to Seignelay , 1685 , he says : “ On the 2nd of July , 1679 , I had the honor to plant his Majesty 's arms in the great village of the Nadouecioux called Izatys , where never had a Frenchman been , etc . ” Izatys is here used not as the name of the village , but as the name of the band — the Isantees . Nadouecioux was a name given the Dakotas generally by the early French traders and the Ojibways . See Shea 's Hennepin 's Description of Louisiana pp . 203 and 375 . The villages of the Dakotas were not permanent towns . They were hardly more than camping grounds , occupied at intervals and for longer or shorter periods , as suited the convenience of the hunters : yet there were certain places , like Mille Lacs , the Falls of St. Anthony , Kapóza ( near St. Paul ) , Remnica , ( where the city of Red Wing now stands ) , and Keúxa ( or Keóza ) on the site of the city of Winona , so frequently occupied by several of the bands as to be considered their chief villages respectively .</p>
