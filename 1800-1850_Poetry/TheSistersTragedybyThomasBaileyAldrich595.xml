    <head>A. D. 1670</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">AGLAE , a widow</l>
     <l n="2">MURIEL , her unmarried sister .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">IT happened once , in that brave land that lies</l>
     <l n="4">For half the twelvemonth wrapt in sombre skies ,</l>
     <l n="5">Two sisters loved one man . He being dead ,</l>
     <l n="6">Grief loosed the lips of her he had not wed ,</l>
     <l n="7">And all the passion that through heavy years</l>
     <l n="8">Had masked in smiles unmasked itself in tears .</l>
     <l n="9">No purer love may mortals know than this ,</l>
     <l n="10">The hidden love that guards another 's bliss .</l>
     <l n="11">High in a turret 's westward-facing room ,</l>
     <l n="12">Whose painted window held the sunset 's bloom ,</l>
     <l n="13">The two together grieving , each to each</l>
     <l n="14">Unveiled her soul with sobs and broken speech .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="15">Both still were young , in life 's rich summer yet ;</l>
     <l n="16">And one was dark , with tints of violet</l>
     <l n="17">In hair and eyes , and one was blond as she</l>
     <l n="18">Who rose — a second daybreak — from the sea ,</l>
     <l n="19">Gold-tressed and azure-eyed . In that lone place ,</l>
     <l n="20">Like dusk and dawn , they sat there face to face .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="21">She spoke the first whose strangely silvering hair</l>
     <l n="22">No wreath had worn , nor widow 's weed might wear ,</l>
     <l n="23">And told her blameless love , and knew no shame —</l>
     <l n="24">Her holy love that , like a vestal flame</l>
     <l n="25">Beside the sacred body of some queen</l>
     <l n="26">Within a guarded crypt had burned unseen</l>
     <l n="27">From weary year to year . And she who heard</l>
     <l n="28">Smiled proudly through her tears and said no word ,</l>
     <l n="29">But , drawing closer , on the troubled brow</l>
     <l n="30">Laid one long kiss , and that was words enow !</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>MURIEL .</head>
     <l n="1">Be still , my heart ! Grown patient with thine ache ,</l>
     <l n="2">Thou shouldst be dumb , yet needs must speak , or break .</l>
     <l n="3">The world is empty now that he is gone .</l>
   </lg>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>AGLAE .</head>
     <l n="1">Ay , sweetheart !</l>
   </lg>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>MURIEL .</head>
     <l n="1">None was like him , no , not one .</l>
     <l n="2">From other men he stood apart , alone</l>
     <l n="3">In honor spotless as unfallen snow .</l>
     <l n="4">Nothing all evil was it his to know ;</l>
     <l n="5">His charity still found some germ , some spark</l>
     <l n="6">Of light in natures that seemed wholly dark .</l>
     <l n="7">He read men 's souls ; the lowly and the high</l>
     <l n="8">Moved on the self-same level in his eye .</l>
     <l n="9">Gracious to all , to none subservient ,</l>
     <l n="10">Without offence he spake the word he meant —</l>
     <l n="11">His word no trick of tact or courtly art ,</l>
     <l n="12">But the white flowering of the noble heart .</l>
     <l n="13">Careless he was of much the world counts gain ,</l>
     <l n="14">Careless of self , too simple to be vain ,</l>
     <l n="15">Yet strung so finely that for conscience-sake</l>
     <l n="16">He would have gone like Cranmer to the stake .</l>
     <l n="17">I saw — how could I help but love ? And you —</l>
   </lg>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>AGLAE .</head>
     <l n="1">At this perfection did I worship too . . .</l>
     <l n="2">‘ Twas this that stabbed me . Heed not what I say !</l>
     <l n="3">I meant it not , my wits are gone astray ,</l>
     <l n="4">With all that is and has been . No , I lie —</l>
     <l n="5">Had he been less perfection , happier I !</l>
   </lg>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>MURIEL .</head>
     <l n="1">Strange words and wild ! ‘ Tis the distracted mind</l>
     <l n="2">Breathes them , not you , and I no meaning find .</l>
   </lg>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>AGLAE .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Yet ‘ twere as plain as writing on a scroll</l>
     <l n="2">Had you but eyes to read within my soul .—</l>
     <l n="3">How a grief hidden feeds on its own mood ,</l>
     <l n="4">Poisons the healthful currents of the blood</l>
     <l n="5">With bitterness , and turns the heart to stone !</l>
     <l n="6">I think , in truth , ‘ twere better to make moan ,</l>
     <l n="7">And so be done with it . This many a year ,</l>
     <l n="8">Sweetheart , have I laughed lightly and made cheer ,</l>
     <l n="9">Pierced through with sorrow !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="10">Then the widowed one</l>
     <l n="11">With sorrowfullest eyes beneath the sun ,</l>
     <l n="12">Faltered , irresolute , and bending low</l>
     <l n="13">Her head , half whispered ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="14">Dear , how could you know ?</l>
     <l n="15">What masks are faces !— yours , unread by me</l>
     <l n="16">These seven long summers ; mine , so placidly</l>
     <l n="17">Shielding my woe ! No tremble of the lip ,</l>
     <l n="18">No cheek 's quick pallor let our secret slip !</l>
     <l n="19">Mere players we , and she that played the queen ,</l>
     <l n="20">Now in her homespun , looks how poor and mean !</l>
     <l n="21">How shall I say it , how find words to tell</l>
     <l n="22">What thing it was for me made earth a hell</l>
     <l n="23">That else had been my heaven ! ‘ Twould blanch your cheek</l>
     <l n="24">Were I to speak it . Nay , but I will speak ,</l>
     <l n="25">Since like two souls at compt we seem to stand ,</l>
     <l n="26">Where nothing may be hidden . Hold my hand ,</l>
     <l n="27">But look not at me ! Noble ‘ twas , and meet ,</l>
     <l n="28">To hide your heart , nor fling it at his feet</l>
     <l n="29">To lie despised there . Thus saved you our pride</l>
     <l n="30">And that white honor for which earls have died .</l>
     <l n="31">You were not all unhappy , loving so !</l>
     <l n="32">I with a difference wore my weight of woe .</l>
     <l n="33">My lord was he . It was my cruel lot ,</l>
     <l n="34">My hell , to love him — for he loved me not !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="35">Then came a silence . Suddenly like death</l>
     <l n="36">The truth flashed on them , and each held her breath —</l>
     <l n="37">A flash of light whereby they both were slain ,</l>
     <l n="38">She that was loved and she that loved in vain !</l>
    </lg>
    <p>THE LAST CAESAR</p>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="39">1851-1870</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="part" n="1">
     <head>I</head>
     <lg type="stanza" n="6">
      <l n="40">Now there was one who came in later days</l>
      <l n="41">To play at Emperor : in the dead of night</l>
      <l n="42">Stole crown and sceptre , and stood forth to light</l>
      <l n="43">In sudden purple . The dawn 's straggling rays</l>
      <l n="44">Showed Paris fettered , murmuring in amaze ,</l>
      <l n="45">With red hands at her throat — a piteous sight .</l>
      <l n="46">Then the new Caesar , stricken with affright</l>
      <l n="47">At his own daring , shrunk from public gaze</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="7">
      <l n="48">In the Elysee , and had lost the day</l>
      <l n="49">But that around him flocked his birds of prey ,</l>
      <l n="50">Sharp-beaked , voracious , hungry for the deed .</l>
      <l n="51">‘ Twixt hope and fear behold great Caesar hang !</l>
      <l n="52">Meanwhile , methinks , a ghostly laughter rang</l>
      <l n="53">Through the rotunda of the Invalides .</l>
     </lg>
    </lg>
    <lg type="part" n="2">
     <head>II</head>
     <lg type="stanza" n="8">
      <l n="54">What if the boulevards , at set of sun ,</l>
      <l n="55">Reddened , but not with sunset 's kindly glow ?</l>
      <l n="56">What if from quai and square the murmured woe</l>
      <l n="57">Swept heavenward , pleadingly ? The prize was won ,</l>
      <l n="58">A kingling made and Liberty undone .</l>
      <l n="59">No Emperor , this , like him awhile ago ,</l>
      <l n="60">But his Name 's shadow ; that one struck the blow</l>
      <l n="61">Himself , and sighted the street-sweeping gun !</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="9">
      <l n="62">This was a man of tortuous heart and brain ,</l>
      <l n="63">So warped he knew not his own point of view —</l>
      <l n="64">The master of a dark , mysterious smile .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="10">
      <l n="65">And there he plotted , by the storied Seine</l>
      <l n="66">And in the fairy gardens of St . Cloud ,</l>
      <l n="67">The Sphinx that puzzled Europe , for awhile .</l>
     </lg>
    </lg>
    <lg type="part" n="3">
     <head>III</head>
     <lg type="stanza" n="11">
      <l n="68">I see him as men saw him once — a face</l>
      <l n="69">Of true Napoleon pallor ; round the eyes</l>
      <l n="70">The wrinkled care ; mustache spread pinion-wise ,</l>
      <l n="71">Pointing his smile with odd sardonic grace</l>
      <l n="72">As wearily he turns him in his place ,</l>
      <l n="73">And bends before the hoarse Parisian cries —</l>
      <l n="74">Then vanishes , with glitter of gold-lace</l>
      <l n="75">And trumpets blaring to the patient skies .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="12">
      <l n="76">Not thus he vanished later ! On his path</l>
      <l n="77">The Furies waited for the hour and man ,</l>
      <l n="78">Foreknowing that they waited not in vain .</l>
     </lg>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Then fell the day , O day of dreadful wrath ! Bow down in shame , O crimson-girt Sedan ! Weep , fair Alsace ! weep , loveliest Lorraine !</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">So mused I , sitting underneath the trees</l>
     <l n="2">In that old garden of the Tuileries ,</l>
     <l n="3">Watching the dust of twilight sifting down</l>
     <l n="4">Through chestnut boughs just toucht with autumn 's brown —</l>
     <l n="5">Not twilight yet , but that illusive bloom</l>
     <l n="6">Which holds before the deep-etched shadows come ;</l>
     <l n="7">For still the garden stood in golden mist ,</l>
     <l n="8">Still , like a river of molten amethyst ,</l>
     <l n="9">The Seine slipt through its spans of fretted stone ,</l>
     <l n="10">And , near the grille that once fenced in a throne ,</l>
     <l n="11">The fountains still unbraided to the day</l>
     <l n="12">The unsubstantial silver of their spray .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="13">A spot to dream in , love in , waste one 's hours !</l>
     <l n="14">Temples and palaces , and gilded towers ,</l>
     <l n="15">And fairy terraces !— and yet , and yet</l>
     <l n="16">Here in her woe came Marie Antoinette ,</l>
     <l n="17">Came sweet Corday , Du Barry with shrill cry ,</l>
     <l n="18">Not learning from her betters how to die !</l>
     <l n="19">Here , while the Nations watched with bated breath ,</l>
     <l n="20">Was held the saturnalia of Red Death !</l>
     <l n="21">For where that slim Egyptian shaft uplifts</l>
     <l n="22">Its point to catch the dawn 's and sunset 's drifts</l>
     <l n="23">Of various gold , the busy Headsman stood . . . .</l>
     <l n="24">Place de la Concorde — no , the Place of Blood !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="25">And all so peaceful now ! One cannot bring</l>
     <l n="26">Imagination to accept the thing .</l>
     <l n="27">Lies , all of it ! some dreamer 's wild romance —</l>
     <l n="28">High-hearted , witty , laughter-loving France !</l>
     <l n="29">In whose brain was it that the legend grew</l>
     <l n="30">Of Maenads shrieking in this avenue ,</l>
     <l n="31">Of watch-fires burning , Famine standing guard ,</l>
     <l n="32">Of long-speared Uhlans in that palace-yard !</l>
     <l n="33">What ruder sound this soft air ever smote</l>
     <l n="34">Than a bird 's twitter or a bugle 's note ?</l>
     <l n="35">What darker crimson ever splashed these walks</l>
     <l n="36">Than that of rose-leaves dropping from the stalks ?</l>
     <l n="37">And yet — what means that charred and broken wall ,</l>
     <l n="38">That sculptured marble , splintered , like to fall ,</l>
     <l n="39">Looming among the trees there ? . . . And you say</l>
     <l n="40">This happened , as it were , but yesterday ?</l>
     <l n="41">And here the Commune stretched a barricade ,</l>
     <l n="42">And there the final desperate stand was made ?</l>
     <l n="43">Such things have been ? How all things change and fade !</l>
     <l n="44">How little lasts in this brave world below !</l>
     <l n="45">Love dies ; hate cools ; the Caesars come and go ;</l>
     <l n="46">Gaunt Hunter fattens , and the weak grow strong .</l>
     <l n="47">Even Republics are not here for long !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="48">Ah , who can tell what hour may bring the doom ,</l>
     <l n="49">The lighted torch , the tocsin 's heavy boom !</l>

     <l n="1">TREAD softly here ; the sacredest of tombs</l>
     <l n="2">Are those that hold your Poets . Kings and queens</l>
     <l n="3">Are facile accidents of Time and Chance .</l>
     <l n="4">Chance sets them on the heights , they climb not there !</l>
     <l n="5">But he who from the darkling mass of men</l>
     <l n="6">Is on the wing of heavenly thought upborne</l>
     <l n="7">To finer ether , and becomes a voice</l>
     <l n="8">For all the voiceless , God anointed him :</l>

     <l n="11">Beneath those marble cenotaphs and urns</l>
     <l n="12">Lies richer dust than ever nature hid</l>
     <l n="13">Packed in the mountain 's adamantine heart ,</l>
     <l n="14">Or slyly wrapt in unsuspected sand —</l>
     <l n="15">The dross men toil for , and oft stain the soul .</l>
     <l n="16">How vain and all ignoble seems that greed</l>
     <l n="17">To him who stands in this dim claustral air</l>

     <l n="50">. . . Room in your heart for him , O Mother Earth ,</l>
     <l n="51">Who loved each flower and leaf that made you fair ,</l>
     <l n="52">And sang your praise in verses manifold</l>
     <l n="53">And delicate , with here and there a line</l>
     <l n="54">From end to end in blossom like a bough</l>
     <l n="55">The May breathes on , so rich it was . Some thought</l>
     <l n="56">The workmanship more costly than the thing</l>
     <l n="57">Moulded or carved , as in those ornaments</l>
     <l n="58">Found at Mycaene . And yet Nature 's self</l>
     <l n="59">Works in this wise ; upon a blade of grass ,</l>
     <l n="60">Or what small note she lends the woodland thrush ,</l>
     <l n="61">Lavishing endless patience . He was born</l>
     <l n="62">Artist , not artisan , which some few saw</l>
     <l n="63">And many dreamed not . As he wrote no odes</l>
     <l n="64">When Croesus wedded or Maecenas died ,</l>
     <l n="65">And gave no breath to civic feasts and shows ,</l>
     <l n="66">He missed the glare that gilds more facile men —</l>
     <l n="67">A twilight poet , groping quite alone ,</l>
     <l n="68">Belated , in a sphere where every nest</l>
     <l n="69">Is emptied of its music and its wings .</l>
     <l n="70">Not great his gift ; yet we can poorly spare</l>
     <l n="71">Even his slight perfection in an age</l>
     <l n="72">Of limping triolets and tame rondeaux .</l>
     <l n="73">He had at least ideals , though unreached ,</l>
     <l n="74">And heard , far off , immortal harmonies ,</l>
     <l n="75">Such as fall coldly on our ear to-day .</l>
     <l n="76">The mighty Zolaistic Movement now</l>
     <l n="77">Engrosses us — a miasmatic breath</l>
     <l n="78">Blown from the slums . We paint life as it is ,</l>
     <l n="79">The hideous side of it , with careful pains ,</l>
     <l n="80">Making a god of the dull Commonplace .</l>
     <l n="81">For have we not the old gods overthrown</l>
     <l n="82">And set up strangest idols ? We could clip</l>
     <l n="83">Imagination 's wing and kill delight ,</l>
     <l n="84">Our sole art being to leave nothing out</l>
     <l n="85">That renders art offensive . Not for us</l>
     <l n="86">Madonnas leaning from their starry thrones</l>
     <l n="87">Ineffable , nor any heaven-wrought dream</l>
     <l n="88">Of sculptor or of poet ; we prefer</l>
     <l n="89">Such nightmare visions as in morbid brains</l>
     <l n="90">Take shape and substance , thoughts that taint the air</l>
     <l n="91">And make all life unlovely . Will it last ?</l>
     <l n="92">Beauty alone endures from age to age ,</l>
     <l n="93">From age to age endures , handmaid of God .</l>
     <l n="94">Poets who walk with her on earth go hence</l>
     <l n="95">Bearing a talisman . You bury one ,</l>
     <l n="96">With his hushed music , in some Potter 's Field ;</l>
     <l n="97">The snows and rains blot out his very name ,</l>
     <l n="98">As he from life seems blotted : through Time 's glass</l>
     <l n="99">Slip the invisible and magic sands</l>
     <l n="100">That mark the century , then falls a day</l>
     <l n="101">The world is suddenly conscious of a flower ,</l>
     <l n="102">Imperishable , ever to be prized ,</l>
     <l n="103">Sprung from the mould of a forgotten grave .</l>
     <l n="104">‘ Tis said the seeds wrapt up among the balms</l>
     <l n="105">And hieroglyphics of Egyptian kings</l>
     <l n="106">Hold strange vitality , and , planted , grow</l>
     <l n="107">After the lapse of thrice a thousand years .</l>
     <l n="108">Some day , perchance , some unregarded note</l>
     <l n="109">Of our poor friend here — some sweet minor chord</l>
     <l n="110">That failed to lure our more accustomed ear —</l>
     <l n="111">May witch the fancy of an unborn age .</l>
     <l n="112">Who knows , since seeds have such tenacity ?</l>
     <l n="113">Meanwhile he 's dead , with scantiest laurel won</l>
     <l n="114">And little of our Nineteenth Century gold .</l>
     <l n="115">So , take him , Earth , and this his mortal part ,</l>
     <l n="116">With that shrewd alchemy thou hast , transmute</l>
     <l n="117">To flower and leaf in thine unending Springs !</l>

   <p>SCENE : St. Petersburg . Period : the present time . A ballroom in the winter palace of the Prince —. The ladies in character costumes and masks . The gentlemen in official dress and unmasked , with the exception of six tall figures in scarlet kaftans , who are treated with marked distinction as they move here and there among the promenaders . Quadrille music throughout the dialogue . Count SERGIUS PAVLOVICH PANSHINE , who has just arrived , is standing anxiously in the doorway of an antechamber with his eyes fixed upon a lady in the costume of a maid of honor in the time of Catherine II . The lady presently disengages herself from the crowd , and passes near Count PANSHINE , who impulsively takes her by the hand and leads her across the threshold of the inner apartment , which is unoccupied .</p>

In what shape came the story to your ear ? Decked in the teller 's colors , I 'll be sworn ; The truth , but in the livery of a lie , And so must wrong me . Only this is true : The Tsar , because I risked my wretched life To shield a life as wretched as my own , Bestows upon me , as supreme reward — O irony !— the hand of this poor girl . Says , HERE , I HAVE THE PEARL OF PEARLS FOR YOU , SUCH AS WAS NEVER PLUCKED FROM OUT THE DEEP BY INDIAN DIVER , FOR A SULTAN 'S CROWN . YOUR JOY 'S DECREED , and stabs me with a smile .</p>

    <head>HE .</head>
     <l n="1">I know not , indeed .</l>
     <l n="2">Likes me , perhaps . What matters it ?— HER love !</l>
     <l n="3">The guardian , Sidor Yurievich , consents ,</l>
     <l n="4">And she consents . No love in it at all ,</l>
     <l n="5">A mere caprice , a young girl 's spring-tide dream .</l>
     <l n="6">Sick of her ear-rings , weary of her mare ,</l>
     <l n="7">She 'll have a lover — something ready-made ,</l>
     <l n="8">Or improvised between two cups of tea —</l>
     <l n="9">A lover by imperial ukase !</l>
     <l n="10">Fate said her word — I chanced to be the man !</l>
     <l n="11">If that grenade the crazy student threw</l>
     <l n="12">Had not spared me , as well as spared the Tsar ,</l>
     <l n="13">All this would not have happened . I 'd have been</l>

     <l n="3">Whiter within the bosom of a cloud ,</l>
     <l n="4">Nor colder either . She is very haughty ,</l>
     <l n="5">For all her fragile air of gentleness ;</l>
     <l n="6">With something vital in her , like those flowers</l>
     <l n="7">That on our desolate steppes outlast the year .</l>
     <l n="8">Resembles you in some things . It was that</l>

     <l n="18">Seemed now to lavish all good gifts on me —</l>
     <l n="19">Gold roubles , office , sudden dearest friends .</l>
     <l n="20">The whole world smiled ; then , as I stooped to taste</l>
     <l n="21">The sweetest cup , freak dashed it from my lip .</l>
     <l n="22">This very night — just think , this very night —</l>

    <head>AT A READING</head>
     <l n="1">The spare Professor , grave and bald ,</l>
     <l n="2">Began his paper . It was called ,</l>
     <l n="3">I think , “ A Brief Historic Glance</l>
     <l n="4">At Russia , Germany , and France . ”</l>
     <l n="5">A glance , but to my best belief</l>
     <l n="6">‘ Twas almost anything but brief —</l>
     <l n="7">A wide survey , in which the earth</l>
     <l n="8">Was seen before mankind had birth ;</l>
     <l n="9">Strange monsters basked them in the sun ,</l>
     <l n="10">Behemoth , armored glyptodon ,</l>
     <l n="11">And in the dawn 's unpractised ray</l>
     <l n="12">The transient dodo winged its way ;</l>
     <l n="13">Then , by degrees , through silt and slough ,</l>
     <l n="14">We reached Berlin — I do n't know how .</l>
     <l n="15">The good Professor 's monotone</l>

     <l n="19">Blue-eyed , intent , with lips whose bloom</l>
     <l n="20">Lighted the heavy-curtained room .</l>
     <l n="21">Hypatia — ah , what lovely things</l>
     <l n="22">Are fashioned out of eighteen springs !</l>
     <l n="23">At first , in sums of this amount ,</l>
     <l n="24">The eighteen winters do not count .</l>
     <l n="25">Just as my eyes were growing dim</l>

     <l n="28">Like a pond-lily taking air .</l>
     <l n="29">She looked so fresh , so wise , so neat ,</l>

     <l n="31">I quite forgot what Bismarck said ,</l>

     <l n="35">The only facts I took away</l>
     <l n="36">From the Professor 's theme that day</l>
     <l n="37">Were these : a forehead broad and low ,</l>
     <l n="38">Such as the antique sculptures show ;</l>
     <l n="39">A chin to Greek perfection true ;</l>
     <l n="40">Eyes of Astarte 's tender blue ;</l>

   <p>THALIA</p>
   <p>A MIDDLE-AGED LYRICAL POET IS SUPPOSED TO BE TAKING FINAL LEAVE OF THE MUSE OF COMEDY . SHE HAS BROUGHT HIM HIS HAT AND GLOVES , AND IS ABSTRACTEDLY PICKING A THREAD OF GOLD HAIR FROM HIS COAT SLEEVE AS HE BEGINS TO SPEAK :</p>
   <p>I say it under the rose — oh , thanks !— yes , under the laurel , We part lovers , not foes ; we are not going to quarrel .</p>
   <p>We have too long been friends on foot and in gilded coaches , Now that the whole thing ends , to spoil our kiss with reproaches .</p>
   <p>I leave you ; my soul is wrung ; I pause , look back from the portal — Ah , I no more am young , and you , child , you are immortal !</p>
   <p>Mine is the glacier 's way , yours is the blossom 's weather — When were December and May known to be happy together ?</p>
   <p>Before my kisses grow tame , before my moodiness grieve you , While yet my heart is flame , and I all lover , I leave you .</p>
   <p>So , in the coming time , when you count the rich years over , Think of me in my prime , and not as a white-haired lover ,</p>
   <p>Fretful , pierced with regret , the wraith of a dead Desire Thrumming a cracked spinet by a slowly dying fire .</p>
   <p>When , at last , I am cold — years hence , if the gods so will it — Say , “ He was true as gold , ” and wear a rose in your fillet !</p>
   <p>Others , tender as I , will come and sue for caresses , Woo you , win you , and die — mind you , a rose in your tresses !</p>
   <p>Some Melpomene woo , some hold Clio the nearest ; You , sweet Comedy — you were ever sweetest and dearest !</p>
   <p>Nay , it is time to go — when writing your tragic sister Say to that child of woe how sorry I was I missed her .</p>
   <p>Really , I cannot stay , though “ parting is such sweet sorrow ” . . . Perhaps I will , on my way down-town , look in to-morrow !</p>
