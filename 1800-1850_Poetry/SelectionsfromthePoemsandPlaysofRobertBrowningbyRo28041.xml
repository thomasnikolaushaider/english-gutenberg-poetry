    <p n="1">THE LIFE OF BROWNING</p>
   </div>
   <titlePage>
    <docTitle><titlePart>Robert Browning , the poet , was the third of that name . The first Robert Browning , a man of energy and ability , held an important post in the Bank of England . His wife , Margaret Tittle , was a Creole from the West Indies , and at the time of her marriage her property was still in the estates owned by her father near St. Kitts . When their son , the second Robert , was seven years of age , his mother died , and his father afterwards married again . The second wife 's ascendency over her husband was unfortunately exerted against the best interests of the son . His desire to become an artist , his wish for a university training , were disregarded , and he was sent instead to St. Kitts , where he was given employment on his mother 's sugar plantations . The breach between Robert and his father became absolute when the boy defied local prejudice by teaching a negro to read , and when , because of what his father considered a sentimental objection to slavery , he finally refused to remain in the West Indies . The young man returned to England and at twenty-two started on an independent career as a clerk in the Bank of England . In 1811 he married Sarah Anne Wiedemann . They settled in Camberwell , London , where Robert , the poet , was born , May 7 , 1812 , and his sister Sarianna in 1814 . Browning 's father was a competent official in the Bank and a successful business man , but his tastes were æsthetic and literary , and his leisure time was accordingly devoted to such pursuits as the collection of old books and manuscripts . He also read widely in both classic and modern literatures . The first book of the Iliad he knew by heart , and all the Odes of Horace , and he was accustomed to soothe his child to sleep by humming to him snatches of Anacreon to the tune of “ A Cottage in the Wood . ” Mr. Browning had also considerable skill in two realms of art , for he drew vigorous portraits and caricatures , and he had , even according to his son 's mature judgment , extraordinary force and facility in verse-making . In character he was serene , lovable , gentle , “ tenderhearted to a fault . ” So instinctively chivalrous was he that there was “ no service which the ugliest , oldest , crossest woman in the world might not have exacted of him . ” He was a man of great physical vigor , dying at the age of eighty-four without ever having been ill .</titlePart></docTitle>
    <docImprint>Browning 's mother was the daughter of William Wiedemann , a German who had settled in Dundee and married a Scotch wife . Mrs. Browning impressed all who knew her by her sweetness and goodness . Carlyle spoke of her as “ the true type of a Scottish gentlewoman ” ; her son 's friend , Mr. Kenyon , said that such as she had no need to go to heaven , because they made it wherever they were ; and her son called her “ a divine woman . ” She had deep religious instincts and concerned herself particularly with her son 's moral and spiritual development . The bond between them was always very strong , and when she died in<date>1849</date>his wife wrote , “ He has loved his mother as such passionate natures can love , and I never saw a man so bowed down in an extremity of sorrow — never . ”</docImprint>
    <docTitle><titlePart>Robert Browning 's childhood was passed in an unusually serene and happy home . In Development he tells how , at five years of age , he was made to understand the main facts of the Trojan War by his father 's clever use of the cat , the dogs , the pony in the stable , and the page-boy , to impersonate the heroes of that ancient conflict . Latin declensions were taught the child by rhymes concocted by his father as memory-easing devices . Stories and even lessons were made intelligible and vivid by colored maps and comic drawings . Until the boy was fourteen , his schooling was of the most casual sort , his only formal training being such as he received in the comparatively unimportant three or four years he spent , after he was ten , at Mr. Ready 's private school . His real education came , through all his early life , from his home . What would now be called nature-study he pursued ardently and on his own initiative in the home garden and neighboring fields . His love for animals was inherited from his mother and fostered by her . He used to keep , says Mrs. Orr in her account of his life , “ owls and monkeys , magpies and hedge-hogs , an eagle , and even a couple of large snakes , constantly bringing home the more portable animals in his pockets and transferring them to his mother for immediate care . ” Browning says that his faculty of observation at this time would not have disgraced a Seminole Indian . In the matter of reading he was not entirely without advice and guidance , but was , on the whole , allowed unusual freedom of choice . He afterwards told Mrs. Orr that Milton , Quarles , Voltaire , Mandeville , and Horace Walpole were the authors in whom , as a boy , he particularly delighted . His love for art was established and developed by visits to the Dulwich picture gallery , of which he afterwards wrote to Miss Barrett with “ love and gratitude ” because he had been allowed to go there before the age prescribed by the rules , and had thus learned to know “ a wonderful Rembrandt , ” a Watteau , “ three triumphant Murillos , ” a Giorgione Music Lesson , and various Poussins . His marked early susceptibility to music is evidenced by an incident narrated by Mr. Sharp : “ One afternoon his mother was playing in the twilight to herself . She was startled to hear a sound behind her . Glancing round she beheld a little white figure distinct against an oak bookcase , and could just discern two large wistful eyes looking earnestly at her . The next moment the child had sprung into her arms , sobbing passionately at he knew not what , but , as his paroxysm subsided , whispering with shy urgency : ‘ Play ! Play ! ’ ”</titlePart></docTitle>
    <docImprint>In various ways the boy Robert was noticeably precocious . He could not remember a time , he said , when he did not rhyme , and his sister records that as a very little boy he used to walk around the table “ spanning out on the smooth mahogany the scansion of verses he had composed . ” Some of these early lines he could recall and he could recall , too , the prodigious satisfaction with which he uttered them , especially the sentence he put into the mouth of a man who had just committed murder — “ Now my soul is satisfied . ” At twelve he had a volume named Incondita ready for publication . To discerning eyes the little volume was a production of great promise , dominated though it was by the influence of his father 's idol , Pope , and of his own temporary ruling deity , Byron . But a publisher was not found , and in later years , at Browning 's request , the two extant manuscript copies of Incondita were destroyed , along with many others of his youthful poems that had been preserved by his father . Browning 's early tastes in the realm of poetry were , on the whole , romantic . “ Now here is the truth , ” he wrote to Miss Barrett , “ the first book I ever bought in my life was Ossian — and years before that the first composition I ever was guilty of was something in imitation of Ossian whom I had not read , but conceived , through two or three scraps in other books . ” But the decisive literary influence was yet to come . When he was fourteen he happened to see on a bookstall a volume marked , “ Mr. Shelley 's Atheistical Poem . Very Scarce ” ; and he at once wished to know more of this Mr. Shelley . After a perplexing search his mother found the desired poems , most of them in first editions , at the Olliers , Vere Street ,<settlement>London</settlement>. She took home also three volumes by another poet , John Keats , who , she was told , was the subject of an elegy by Shelley . Browning never forgot the May evening when he first read these new books , to the accompaniment , he said , of two nightingales , one in a copper-beech , one in a laburnum , each striving to outdo the other in melody . A new imaginative world was opened to the boy . In Memorabilia he afterwards recorded the strong intellectual and emotional excitement , the thrill and ecstasy of this poetical experience . To Shelley especially did he give immediate and fervid personal loyalty , even to the extent of endeavoring to follow him in “ atheism ” and vegetarianism . When at fourteen the boy left Mr. Ready 's school it was decided that his further education should be carried on at home under private tutors . He studied music under able masters , one in thorough-bass , and one in execution . He played and sang , and he composed spirited settings for songs . He read voraciously . He took lessons in dancing , riding , boxing , and fencing , and is said to have shown himself exceptionally active and vigorous . He kept up his interest in art , and he practiced drawing from casts . He found time also for various friendships . For Miss Eliza and Miss Sarah Flower , two sisters , nine and seven years his senior , he had a deep affection . Both young ladies were gifted in music , and this was one source of their attractions for the music-loving boy . Miss Sarah Flower wrote sacred hymns , the best known of which is “ Nearer my God to Thee , ” and her sister composed music which Browning , even in his mature years , ranked as of especial significance . Other friends of this period were Joseph Arnold , afterwards Chief Justice of Bombay , and a man of great ability ; Alfred Domett , a striking and interesting personality described by Browning in a poem beginning “ What 's Become of Waring , ” and referred to in “ The Guardian Angel ” ; and the three Silverthorne boys , his cousins , the death of one of whom was the occasion of the poem “ May and Death . ” In spite of friends , a beautiful home , and congenial work , this period of home tutelage does not seem to have been altogether happy . His sister in commenting on this period said , “ The fact was , poor boy , he had outgrown his social surroundings . They were absolutely good , but they were narrow ; it could not be otherwise ; he chafed under them . ” Furthermore , the youth , before he had found his real work as a poet , was restless , irritable , and opinionated ; and an ever-present cause of friction was the fact that there were few subjects of taste on which he and his father did not disagree . Their poetic tastes were especially at variance . The father counted Pope supreme in poetry , and it was many years before he could take pleasure in the form in which his son 's genius expressed itself . All the more noteworthy , then , is the generosity with which Mr. Browning looked after his son 's interests through the unprofitable early years of his poetic career , a generosity never lost sight of by the son . Mr. Sharp in his Life of Browning records some words uttered by Mr. Browning a week or two before his death , which show how permanent was his sense of indebtedness to his father . “ It would have been quite unpardonable in my case , ” he said , “ not to have done my best . My dear father put me in a condition most favorable for the best work I was capable of . When I think of the many authors who have had to fight their way through all sorts of difficulties , I have no reason to be proud of my achievements .... He secured for me all the care and comfort that a literary man needs to do good work . It would have been shameful if I had not done my best to realize his expectations of me . ” After it was determined that Robert should “ commence poet , ” he and his father came to the conclusion that a university training had many elements foreign to the aim the youth had set before him , and that a richer and more directly available preparation could be gained from “ sedulous cultivation of the powers of his mind ” at home , and from “ seeing life in the best sense ” at home and abroad . Mrs. Orr tells us that the first qualifying step of the zealous young poet was to read and digest the whole of Dr. Johnson 's Dictionary . Browning 's first published poem , Pauline , appeared anonymously in January ,<date>1833</date>, when he was twenty years old . This poem is of especial autobiographical interest . Its enthusiastic praise of Shelley recalls his early devotion to that poet , and in many scattered passages we find references to his own personality or experiences . The following lines show with what intensity he recreated the lives and scenes in the books he read : And I myself went with the tale — a god Wandering after beauty , or a giant Standing vast in the sunset — an old hunter Talking with gods , or a high-crested chief Sailing with troops of friends to Tenedos . I tell you , naught has ever been so clear As the place , the time , the fashion of those lives : I had not seen a work of lofty art , Nor woman 's beauty , nor sweet nature 's face , Yet , I say , never morn broke clear as those On the dim clustered isles in the blue sea , The deep groves and white temples and wet caves ; And nothing ever will surprise me now — Who stood beside the naked Swift-footed , Who bound my forehead with Proserpine 's hair . There is true and powerful self-analysis in the lines beginning : I am made up of an intensest life ;</docImprint>
    <docTitle><titlePart>and the invocation in lines 811-854 reveals the passionately religious nature of the young poet . In The Early Writings of Robert Browning<span corresp="#note1" type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>Mr. Gosse gives an account of the impression made by this poem upon men so diverse as the Rev . William Johnson Fox , John Stuart Mill , and Dante Gabriel Rossetti , to all of whom , in spite of its crudities and very evident immaturity , it seemed a production of exceptional promise .</titlePart></docTitle>
    <docImprint>After an interval of two years Browning published , this time under his own name , a second long poem . The subject , Paracelsus , had been suggested by the friend , Amédeé de Ripert-Monclar , to whom the poem is dedicated . In pursuance of his purposed rehabilitation of a vanished age Browning made extensive researches in the British Museum into the history of Paracelsus , the great leader in sixteenth century medical science ; but in the poem the facts are subordinated to a minute analysis of the spiritual history of Paracelsus . The poem was too abstruse in subject and style to bring Browning popularity , but his genius was recognized by important critics , and , though he was but twenty-three , he was admitted into the foremost literary circles of<settlement>London</settlement>. One of his most distinguished new friends was Mr. Macready , the great actor . It was at his house that Browning first met Mr. Forster , who had already written favorable critiques of Paracelsus , one for The Examiner and one for The New Monthly Magazine . Other literary associates of this period were Leigh Hunt , Barry Cornwall , Sergeant Talfourd , Dickens , and Walter Savage Landor . There were not infrequent dinners and suppers to which the young poet was welcomed . He is described as being at this period singularly handsome . “ He looks and acts , ” said Mr. Macready , “ more like a youthful poet than any man I ever saw . ” He had sculpturesque masses of dark wavy hair , a skin like delicate ivory , deep-set , expressive eyes , and a sensitive mouth . He was slender , graceful , and most attractive in manner , and he was something of a dandy in his attention to dress . He is said to have made an especially good impression on one occasion when the circumstances must have been as trying as they were exhilarating . In May ,<date>1836</date>, a group of poets had assembled at Mr. Talfourd 's to celebrate Macready 's successful production of Talfourd 's Ion . Browning sat opposite Macready , who was between Wordsworth and Landor . When Talfourd proposed a toast , “ The Poets of<country>England</country>, ” he spoke in complimentary terms of Wordsworth and Landor , but called for a response from “ the youngest of the Poets of<country>England</country>, the author of Paracelsus . ” Landor raised his cup to the young man , and Wordsworth shook hands with him across the table , saying , “ I am proud to know you , Mr. Browning . ” Browning 's third literary venture was a tragedy , Strafford , dedicated to Macready , at whose request it was written . The drama presents the impeachment , condemnation , and execution of the Earl of Strafford , a statesman who , according to the play , loved the unworthy King Charles the First and sacrificed everything , even to life itself , in his blind loyalty to a master who treacherously deserted him in the hour of need . It was a topic to which Browning had already given much thought , for he had the preceding year completed , from materials supplied by Mr. John Forster , a Life of Strafford begun by Forster for Lardner 's Eminent British Statesmen .<span corresp="#note2" type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>The question of the historic truthfulness of the drama is discussed by the historian Gardiner in the Introduction to Miss Emily H. Hickey 's edition of Strafford . He shows that the play is in its details and “ even in the very roots of the situation ” untrue to fact , and yet he maintains that in the chief characters there is essential truth of conception . “ Every time that I read the play , ” says Gardiner , “ I feel more certain that Browning has seized the real Strafford ... Charles , too , with his faults , perhaps exaggerated , is nevertheless the real Charles . ” The play was produced at Covent Garden Theater in May ,<date>1837</date>, with Macready as Strafford and Miss Helen Faucit as Lady Carlisle , and was successful in spite of poor scenery and costuming and poor acting in some of the parts . But owing to the financial condition of the theater and the consequent withdrawal of one of the important actors after the fifth night , the play had but a brief run . It was presented again in<date>1886</date>under the auspices of the Browning Society , and its power as an acting play “ surprised and impressed ” the audience . Before the composition of Strafford Browning had begun a long poem , Sordello , which he completed after his first visit to<country>Italy</country>in<date>1838</date>, and published in<date>1840</date>. No one of his poems is more difficult to read , and many are the stories told of the dismay occasioned by its various perplexities . The effect of this poem on Browning 's fame was disastrous . In fact , after Sordello there began a period , twenty years long , of almost complete indifference in<country>England</country>to Browning 's work . The enthusiasm over the promise of his early poems died quite away . Late in life Mr. Browning commented on this period of his literary career as a time of “ prolonged desolateness . ” Yet the years<date>1841-1846</date>are the years in which he attained his poetic maturity , and years in which he did some of his best work . During this period he brought out the series somewhat fancifully called Bells and Pomegranates . The phrase itself comes from Exodus xxviii , 33 , 34 . As a title Browning explained it to mean “ something like a mixture of music with discoursing , sound with sense , poetry with thought . ” This cheap serial edition , the separate numbers of which sold at first at sixpence and later at half a crown , included Pippa Passes , King Victor and King Charles , Dramatic Lyrics , The Return of the Druses , A Blot in the ‘ Scutcheon , Colombe 's Birthday , Dramatic Romances and Lyrics , Luria , and A Soul 's Tragedy . All of Browning 's plays except Strafford and In a Balcony came out of this series . The most beautiful of them all , Pippa Passes , appeared in<date>1841</date>. It is hardly a drama at all in the conventional sense , though it has one scene , that between Ottima and Sebald , of the highest dramatic power ; but it has always been a favorite with readers . When it was published Miss Barrett wrote to Mr. Browning that she found it in her heart to covet the authorship of this poem more than any other of his works , and he said in answer that he , too , liked Pippa better than anything else he had yet done . Mr. Sharp , while emphasizing the undramatic quality of the play , counts it “ the most imperishable because the most nearly immaculate of Browning 's dramatic poems . ” “ It seems to me , ” he adds , “ like all simple and beautiful things , profound enough for the sinking plummet of the most curious explorer of the depths of life . It can be read , re-read , learned by heart , and the more it is known the wider and more alluring are the avenues of imaginative thought which it discloses . It has , more than any other long composition by its author , that quality of symmetry , that symmetria prisca recorded of Leonardo da Vinci in the Latin epitaph of Platino Piatto ; and , as might be expected , its mental basis , what Rossetti called fundamental brain work , is as luminous , depth within depth , as the morning air .... Everyone who knows Browning at all knows Pippa Passes . ” Of the seven dramas published in Bells and Pomegranates there is comparatively little stage history to record . In spite of occasional fairly successful productions it must be admitted that Browning 's plays have never achieved , probably never will achieve , popularity in the shape of long runs in many cities .<span corresp="#note3" type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>They are too subjective , too analytic , too psychological , for quick or easy understanding . But to the reader they offer many delights . The stories are clear , coherent , interesting ; the characters strongly individualized ; the crises of experience stimulating ; the interaction of personalities subtly analyzed ; the poetry noble and beautiful . The two non-dramatic numbers of Bells and Pomegranates were Dramatic Lyrics ( No . 3 ,<date>1842</date>) and Dramatic Romances and Lyrics ( No . 7 ,<date>1845</date>) . The first included such poems as “ Cavalier Tunes , ” “ In a Gondola , ” “ Porphyria , ” and “ The Pied Piper of Hamelin ” ; the second included “ How they Brought the Good News from Ghent to Aix , ” “ The Lost Leader , ” “ The Tomb at St. Praxed 's , ” “ The Flight of the Duchess , ” “ The Boy and the Angel , ” and the first part of “ Saul . ” These poems , together with the dramas , make a remarkably rich body of poetry to be produced in the short space of five years . And the character of the work , its variety and beauty and strength and originality , were such that its meager and grudging acceptance seems now inexplicable . The most important event in the life of Browning during this period was his acquaintance with Miss Elizabeth Barrett . In<date>1844</date>she brought out a new volume of poems which he saw and greatly admired . He wrote to her expressing delight in her work and asking permission to call ; but Miss Barrett , owing to long-continued invalidism , had lived in almost entire seclusion , and she was not at first willing to receive Mr. Browning . This was in January ,<date>1845</date>, and many letters passed between them before the first interview in the following May . Mr. Browning 's love for Miss Barrett found almost immediate expression and she was soon conscious of an equally strong love for him , but for a considerable time she persistently refused to marry him . To her mind the obstacles were almost insurmountable . Of these her ill-health was chief . She could not consent , she said , to dim the prosperities of his career by a union with her future , which she characterized as a precarious thing , a thing for making burdens out of — but not for his carrying . In exchange for the “ noble extravagancies ” of his love she could bring him only “ anxiety and more sadness than he was born to . ” This obstacle of ill-health was unexpectedly modified by a very mild winter and by the new physical vigor brought in the train of new happiness . From this point of view the marriage , though hazardous , was practicable by the end of the summer of<date>1846</date>. A second obstacle lay in the nature and opinions of Miss Barrett 's father , who governed even his grown-up children by “ an incredible system of patriarchal absolutism . ” By what was variously termed an obliquity of the will , an eccentricity , a monomania , he had decided that none of his children should marry , and on this point he demanded “ passive obedience . ” It was perfectly clear that Miss Barrett could not gain his consent to her marriage , and so , after long hesitation and much unhappiness , she decided to marry Mr. Browning without that consent . In order to save her family and close friends from the blame sure to fall upon them for the remotest sanction of her marriage , her plans were kept an absolute secret . She met Mr. Browning at Marylebone Church on September 12 ,<date>1846</date>, and they were married there , Mrs. Browning returning at once to her own home , where she remained till a week later , when she started for<country>Italy</country>with her husband . The wedding was then announced . Throughout her father 's life Mrs. Browning endeavored to placate him , for she devotedly loved him and she had been his favorite child , but in vain . He would never see her again , he returned her letters unopened , and he would not allow her to be spoken of in his presence . After resting a week in<settlement>Paris</settlement>Mr. and Mrs. Browning went on to Pisa , where they remained nearly seven months . The “ miracle ” of the Pisa life was Mrs. Browning 's gain in health . “ You are not improved , you are transformed , ” was Mrs. Jameson 's exclamation . It was at Pisa that Mr. Browning came to know of the sonnets his wife had written during the progress of their courtship and engagement . In Critical Kit-Kats (<date>1896</date>) Mr. Gosse tells the story as Mr. Browning gave it to him : “ One day , early in<date>1847</date>, their breakfast being over , Mrs. Browning went upstairs , while her husband stood at the window watching the street till the table could be cleared . He was presently aware of someone behind him , although the servant had gone . It was Mrs. Browning who held him by the shoulder to prevent his turning to look at her , and at the same time pushed a packet of papers into the pocket of his coat . She told him to read that and to tear it up if he did not like it ; and then she fled again to her room . ” Mr. Browning felt at once that he had no right to keep such poetry as a private possession . “ I dared not , ” he said , “ reserve to myself the finest sonnets written in any language since Shakespeare 's . ” They were accordingly published in<date>1850</date>, under the intentionally mystifying title , Sonnets from the Portuguese . The Brownings reached Florence April 20 ,<date>1847</date>. After several changes they were , in May ,<date>1848</date>, established in the home in which they remained during Mrs. Browning 's life . It was a suite of rooms on the second floor of the Palazzo Guidi . Of the practical side of this early Florentine life , Mrs. Browning wrote , “ My dear brothers have the illusion that nobody should marry on less than two thousand a year . Good heavens ! how preposterous it does seem to me ! We scarcely spend three hundred , and I have every luxury I ever had , and which it would be so easy to give up , at need ; and Robert would n't sleep , I think , if an unpaid bill dragged itself by any chance into another week . He says that when people get into pecuniary difficulties his sympathies always go with the butchers and the bakers . ” In accordance with this horror of owing five shillings five days , the furnishings of the new home , “ the rococo chairs , spring sofas , carved bookcases , satin from cardinals ’ beds , and the rest , ” were accumulated at a pace dictated by the bank account , but for all that it was not long before the rooms began to take on an aspect as beautiful as it was homelike . By preference the Brownings lived very quietly . At the end of fifteen months Mrs. Browning wrote , “ Robert has not been out an evening of the fifteen months ; but what with music and books and writing and talking , we scarcely know how the days go , it 's such a gallop on the grass . ” March 9 ,<date>1849</date>, was born Wiedemann , later known as “ Penini ” or “ Pen ” Browning . Coincident with this joy was the grief caused by the death of Browning 's mother , a sorrow from which he rallied but slowly . The Florentine life was occasionally varied by summers at Bagni di Lucca , winters in<settlement>Paris</settlement>or Rome , and several visits to<country>England</country>. There was also an increasing social life . Americans were especially welcome to the Brownings because , while<country>England</country>was still indifferent to Browning 's work ,<country>America</country>had given it an appreciative welcome . In March ,<date>1861</date>, Mrs. Browning wrote , “ I do n't complain for myself of an unappreciative public . I have no reason . But just for that reason I complain more about Robert .... In<country>America</country>he is a power , a writer , a poet — he is read , he lives in the hearts of the people . "[ 4 ] Among the Americans associated with the Brownings for longer or shorter periods during their life in Florence were two distinguished women , Margaret Fuller Ossoli and Harriet Beecher Stowe . In<date>1847</date>, George William Curtis spent two days with the Brownings at Vallombrosa , a visit later described in his Easy Chair . Mr. Field , who had brought out the American reprint of the two-volume edition of Browning 's poems in<date>1849</date>, was a guest at Casa Guidi in<date>1852</date>. Charles Sumner writes of “ delicious Tuscan evenings ” with the Brownings and the Storys in<date>1859</date>. Mr. Browning 's interests in art led to friendships with American artists , among whom were Mr . Page , who painted a successful portrait of Browning ; Miss Harriet Hosmer , to whom Mr. and Mrs. Browning finally consented to sit for the “ Clasped Hands ” ; and Hiram Powers . The dearest American friends were , however , Mr. and Mrs. Hawthorne and Mr. and Mrs. Story . Music and art were among Browning 's chief delights in Florence . George William Curtis in describing the trip to Vallombrosa says that it was part of their pleasure to sit in the dusky convent chapel while Browning at the organ “ chased a fugue of Master Hughes of Saxe Gotha , or dreamed out upon twilight keys a faint throbbing toccata of Galuppi 's . ” Modeling in clay was even more satisfying as a personal resource . In the autumn of<date>1860</date>Mrs. Browning wrote , “ Robert has taken to modeling under Mr. Story ( at his studio ) and is making extraordinary progress , turning to account his studies in anatomy . He has copied already two busts , the young Augustus and the Psyche , and is engaged on another , enchanted with his new trade , working six hours a day . ” Some months later she added , “ The modeling combines body-work and soul-work , and the more tired he has been , and the more his back ached , poor fellow , the more he has exulted and been happy — ‘ no , nothing ever made him so happy before . ’ ” He found , also , an unfailing pleasure in the study of great pictures . And he was a buyer of pictures with a collector 's delight in hunting out the work of the unappreciated early Tuscan artists . Mrs. Orr says that he owned at least one picture by each of the obscure artists mentioned in “ Old Pictures in Florence . ” Mrs. Browning sometimes expressed regret that Browning should give himself so unreservedly in so many directions , because she felt that he had thus too little time and energy left for poetry . Her fear was not without justification , for after the richly productive period from<date>1841</date>to<date>1846</date>, we come upon a space of nine years the only publications of which are , in<date>1850</date>, Christmas Eve and Easter Day , a long poem in two parts giving the arguments in favor of Christianity ; and , in<date>1852</date>, an introduction to a collection of letters then supposed to be by Shelley , but since found to be spurious . The essay is nevertheless of importance as an exposition of Browning 's theory of poetry , and as an interesting study of Shelley . In<date>1855</date>, at the close of this period of nine years , there appeared a collection of fifty-one poems entitled Men and Women . In “ fundamental brain power , ” insight , beauty , and mastery of style , these poems show Browning at the highest level of his poetic achievement . It is in these remarkable poems that he brought to perfection a poetic form which he practically invented , the dramatic monologue , a form in which there is but one speaker but which is essentially dramatic in effect . The dramatic quality arises partly from the implied presence of listeners whose expressions of assent or dissent determine the progress or the abrupt changes of direction of the speaker 's words . In “ Andrea del Sarto , ” for example , Lucrezia 's smiles and frowns and gestures of impatience are a constant influence , and the poem presents as vivid an interplay of personalities as any scene in a drama . But the implied listener is hardly more than a secondary dramatic element , the chief one being that the speaker talks , as do the characters in a play , out of the demands of the immediate experience , gradually and casually disclosing all the tangled web of influence , all the clashes of will with destiny , of desire with convention , that have led to the crisis depicted . Fra Lippo Lippi gives no consecutive history of his life , only such snatches of it as partially account for his present mad freak , but the strife between his own nature and instinct on the one hand and the conventions and traditions of religious art on the other could hardly be more vividly presented . In a Balcony , the one drama in Men and Women , has but a fragment of a plot , but in intensity , reality , and passion it excels most of Browning 's dramas , and , in spite of its long speeches , has proved effective on the stage .<span corresp="#note5" type="note_anchor">[ 5 ]</span>In variety of theme , subject-matter , and verse-form , the poems of Men and Women defy classification . Whatever page one turns , there is something novel , stimulating , captivating . All of Browning 's Florentine interests are represented here — his love of old pictures and little-known music , his delight in Florence , Venice , Rome , in all<country>Italy</country>, her skies and her landscapes , the vagrants of her streets , her religious ceremonies , her church dignitaries , her scholars . Then there are love-poems in all tones and tempers , the noblest of them all , “ One Word More , ” being Browning 's most direct and personal tribute to his wife . And we see in its keenest form his intellectual delight in subtle disquisition . The doctrine of immortality as it appeals to the mind of the cultured , dissatisfied pagan Cleon ; the miracle of Lazarus as it is brooded over by the Arab physician Karshish ; the balancing of faith and doubt in the clever casuistry of Bishop Blougram — these are topics to Browning 's taste and are treated with skill and mastery . Taken all in all these poems give to the reader a full impression of Browning 's characteristic force , the darting , penetrating power of his phrase , the rush and energy and leap of his thought . It is by Men and Women , the somewhat similar Dramatis Personæ , and the earlier Dramatic Lyrics and Dramatic Romances , that Browning is most widely and most favorably known . During the first ten years that the Brownings were in Florence Mrs. Browning 's health was so good that she was able to enjoy social and outdoor pleasures to a degree that would have been thought impossible before her marriage . She had also kept up her literary work . A new edition of her poems appeared in<date>1849</date>; in<date>1851</date>she published Casa Guidi Windows , poems illustrative of her ardent interest in all that pertained to the fight for Italian freedom ; and in<date>1856</date>her long-planned verse novel Aurora Leigh was completed and published . But soon after this her strength began insensibly to fail and during the last three years of her life she suffered much from repeated bronchial attacks . However , her death , in June ,<date>1861</date>, was entirely unexpected . The Florentines had loved her deeply and had appreciated her utterances in behalf of a free<country>Italy</country>. She was , accordingly , buried in Florence , with “ extraordinary demonstrations of respect , ” and the house where she had lived was marked by the municipality with a commemorative tablet . Browning 's wish was to leave Florence at once and to make the new life as unlike the old as possible . He went to<settlement>London</settlement>, and after some delay established himself in a house at Warwick Crescent , where he lived till<date>1887</date>. The first portion of his life in<country>England</country>was one of “ unbearable loneliness . ” He took care of his son , busied himself with a new edition of his wife 's poems , read and studied and wrote with feverish intensity , and avoided people . But with the spring of<date>1863</date>, says Mr. Gosse , “ a great change came over Browning 's habits . He had shunned all invitations into society , but ... it suddenly occurred to him that this mode of life was morbid and unworthy , ” and thereupon he entered into the social , literary , musical , and artistic life of<settlement>London</settlement>. The nine years following<date>1855</date>were again a period of small productivity . Dramatis Personæ was a slender volume to represent so many years , even though it contained such great poems as “ Rabbi Ben Ezra , ” “ A Death in the Desert , ” and “ Abt Vogler . ” But during this period a long poem , The Ring and the Book , had been maturing . In<date>1860</date>, while still at Casa Guidi , Browning had found at a book-stall the now famous “ square old yellow Book , ” containing the legal record of a famous Roman murder case . He read the account on the way home , and before night had so mastered the details that , as he paced up and down on the terrace in the darkness , he saw the tragedy unfold before him in picture after picture . It was not , however , till<date>1864</date>that he definitely set to work on the composition of the poem . It was published in four volumes of three parts each , in the winter and spring of<date>1868-9</date>. The poem has a novel structure . The story is retold ten times by different persons and with such variations of fact and opinions and style as are dictated by the knowledge and the character of the speaker . The monologues of Count Guido , who murdered his wife , of Pompilia the young wife , of Caponsacchi the “ soldier saint ” who endeavored to save her , and of the old Pope , are by far the most interesting portions of the poem , but the whole of it is remarkable , and it justly takes rank as one of<country>England</country>'s greatest poems . With the appearance of this book Browning 's genius received adequate recognition in high places . The Athenæum called it “ the opus magnum of the generation , not merely beyond all parallel the supremest poetic achievement of the time , but the most precious and profound spiritual treasure that<country>England</country>has possessed since the days of Shakespeare . ” The last ten or twelve years of Browning 's life were so crowded with interests , occupations , publications , friends , honors , that not even a summary of them can be undertaken here . Mr. Sharp says of this period : “ Everybody wished him to come and dine ; and he did his best to gratify Everybody . He saw everything ; read all the notable books ; kept himself acquainted with the leading contents of the journals and magazines ; conducted a large correspondence ; read new French , German , and Italian books of mark ; read and translated Euripides and Æschylus ; knew all the gossip of the literary clubs , the salons , and the studios ; was a frequenter of afternoon tea parties ; and then , over and above it , he was Browning — the most profoundly subtle mind that has exercised itself in poetry since Shakespeare . ” Mr. Henry James in commenting on Browning 's rich and ample<settlement>London</settlement>period with “ its felicities and prosperities of every sort , ” says that in contemplating “ the wonderful Browning ... the accomplished , saturated , sane , sound man of the<settlement>London</settlement>world and the world of culture , ” it was impossible not to believe that “ he had arrived somehow , for his own deep purposes , at the enjoyment of a double identity , ” so dissociated were the poet and the “ member of society . ” Phillips Brooks , who met Browning in<country>England</country>in<date>1865-6</date>, was impressed by his fullness of life and said he was “ very like some of the best of Thackeray 's<settlement>London</settlement>men . ” In public and on ordinary social occasions Browning is said to have been frank , charming , friendly — “ more agreeable , ” Mary Anderson said , “ than distinguished . ” With intimate friends , however , the poet had quite another sort of charm . “ To a single listener , ” says Mr. Gosse , with whom he was on familiar terms , “ the Browning of his own study was to the Browning of a dinner party as a tiger cat is to a domestic cat . In such conversation his natural strength came out . His talk assumed the volume and the tumult of a cascade . His voice rose to a shout , sank to a whisper , ran up and down the gamut of conversational melody . Those whom he was expecting will never forget his welcome , the loud trumpet-note from the other end of the passage , the talk already in full flood at a distance of twenty feet . Then , in his own study or drawing-room , what he loved was to capture his visitor in a low armchair 's ‘ sofa-lap of leather , ’ and from a most unfair vantage of height to tyrannize , to walk around the victim , in front , behind , on this side , on that , weaving magic circles , now with gesticulating arms thrown high , now groveling on the floor to find some reference in a folio , talking all the while , a redundant turmoil of thoughts , fancies , and reminiscences flowing from those generous lips . ” Elsewhere Mr. Gosse summed up his personal impressions of Mr. Browning , as follows : “ I am bound to tell you that I saw a different Browning from the hero of all the handbooks and ‘ gospels ’ which are now in vogue . People are beginning to treat this vehement and honest poet as if he were a sort of Marcus Aurelius and John the Baptist rolled into one . I have just seen a book in which it is proposed that Browning should supersede the Bible , in which it is asserted that a set of his volumes will teach religion better than all the theologies in the world . Well , I did not know that holy monster .... What I saw was an unostentatious , keen , active man of the world , one who never failed to give good practical advice in matters of business and conduct , one who loved his friends and certainly hated his enemies ; a man alive in every eager passionate nerve of him ; a man who loved to discuss people and affairs , and a bit of a gossip ; a bit of a partisan , too , and not without his humorous prejudices . He was simple to a high degree , simple in his scrupulous dress , his loud , happy voice , his insatiable curiosity . ” Browning 's<settlement>London</settlement>life was varied by many summer journeyings to French sea-coast towns , to Wales , and to Scotland . But it was seventeen years after the death of his wife before he could bring himself to revisit<country>Italy</country>. Even then he avoided Florence . He took his sister to Northern<country>Italy</country>; and Asolo and Venice became the towns around which their affections centered . Two American friends , Mrs. Bloomfield-Moore , and Mrs. Arthur Bronson ,<span corresp="#note6" type="note_anchor">[ 6 ]</span>contributed to the happiness of these Italian sojourns . In<date>1888</date>Browning 's son , who had married an American girl , bought the Palazzo Rezzonico in Venice , so that Browning had an additional personal reason for his trip to Venice in<date>1889</date>. He was well , and he took great pleasure in his son 's admirably planned restoration of the old Venetian palace . He worked , walked , talked with nearly normal vigor . But a bronchial attack proved more than his weakened heart could withstand , and he died peacefully , almost painlessly , in his son 's home on December 12 ,<date>1889</date>. On the day of his death his last book , Asolando , was published , so that his brave-hearted “ Epilogue ” was really his valediction to this and his heroic greeting to another world . He could “ greet the unseen with a cheer , ” because in thought and act he was One who never turned his back but marched breast forward , Never doubted clouds would break , Never dreamed , though right were worsted , wrong would triumph , Held we fall to rise , are baffled to fight better , Sleep to wake . Browning was buried in Westminster Abbey on the last day of the year . The most pathetic element of the imposing ceremonies was the singing of Mrs. Browning 's poem , “ He Giveth His Beloved Sleep . ”</docImprint>

   <head>THE POETRY OF BROWNING</head>
   <p>Before entering upon a discussion of Browning 's poetry it will be of interest to note briefly some of the more striking general characteristics of the English literature contemporary with his work . From Pauline to Asolando is over half a century , but as a central and especially significant portion of Browning 's career we may take the three decades from 1841 , when he began the Bells and Pomegranates series , to 1869 , when The Ring and the Book appeared , for these years include all of his dramas and most of the poetry on which his fame rests . A survey of this period at once reveals the predominance of fiction . Within these years come nearly all the novels of Charles Dickens , of William Makepeace Thackeray , of Charlotte Brontë , of Wilkie Collins , of Charles Kingsley , of Mrs. Gaskell , of Anthony Trollope , of George Macdonald , of Charles Reade , much of the work of Bulwer Lytton , all the novels of George Eliot except Middlemarch and Daniel Deronda , and the earliest of George Meredith 's books . This is a notable showing . No previous period in English literature had presented anything like so wide a range in fiction or had brought forward so large a number of novels of the first rank . These years were equally rich in essays , including much of Carlyle 's work , all of Macaulay 's except the early “ Essay on Milton , ” the religious polemics of Frederick Dennison Maurice and John Henry Newman , nearly all of Ruskin 's discussions of art and social history , most of Leigh Hunt 's literary criticism , and Matthew Arnold 's important early critical essays . This , too , is a notable showing . But if we turn to the two realms in which Browning excelled , poetry and drama , we find different conditions . During the central period of his career , there was , aside from his own work , not a single important drama published . The theaters were prosperous , but they brought out only old plays or new ones of inferior rank . In poetry , too , if we set aside the great names of Tennyson and Browning , the period was neither rich nor varied . During Browning 's first great productive period , 1841-46 , the only other poems of note were Tennyson 's two volumes in 1842 . In the nine years from 1846 to Men and Women in 1855 , the chief poems were Tennyson 's The Princess , In Memoriam , and Maud , for though Wordsworth 's Prelude was one of the greatest publications of the mid-century , it was written years before , and can hardly be counted as belonging to this era . There are , during the decade , many poems of secondary rank , the most important of them being Mrs. Browning 's Sonnets from the Portuguese and Aurora Leigh , but besides Tennyson and Browning , the only poet of high rank is Matthew Arnold , whose slender volumes voice the doubts and difficulties of the age as Browning 's poems voice its optimism . In the fourteen years between Men and Women and The Ring and the Book poets of a new kind appear ; William Morris 's Defense of Guinevere , The Life and Death of Jason and The Earthly Paradise , and Swinburne 's early poems are alien to the work of Browning in form , subject-matter , and ideals . The fact is , the more definitely we try to place Browning in his literary environment the more distinctly do we perceive that he was sui generis among his contemporaries . He combined in striking fashion the intensity of the poet and the strong social sense of the prose writer .</p>
   <p>It seems also wise to glance at the outset at a few of the main criticisms that have been made on Browning 's poetry , for the result of his marked originality is that no poet of the time has been so greatly praised and blamed .</p>
   <p>A natural first topic is his really famous “ obscurity . ” This obscurity is variously ascribed to a diction unduly learned , or almost unintelligibly colloquial , or grotesquely inventive ; to figures of speech drawn from sources too unfamiliar or elaborated to the point of confusion ; to sentences complicated by startling inversions , by double parentheses , by broken constructions , or by a grammatical structure defying analysis . It would be quite possible to illustrate each of these points from Browning 's works , and it cannot be denied that his poetry is sometimes needlessly and inexcusably hard reading . But in reality the difficulties in his poems come less from stylistic defects than from the subject matter . What Mr. Chesterton calls Browning 's love for “ the holes and corners of history , ” leads him to the use of much unfamiliar detail . A large part of the difficulty in reading Sordello arises from the fact that all Browning 's accumulated knowledge of medieval Italy is there poured forth in an allusive , taken-for-granted manner , till even the practiced reader turns away perplexed and overwhelmed . So , too , “ Old Pictures in Florence , ” “ Pictor Ignotus , ” and “ Fra Lippo Lippi ” assume on the part of the reader a minute familiarity with early Florentine art . Occasionally the poems demand an exceptional technical knowledge of some sort , as in “ Abt Vogler , ” where only a trained musician can fully understand the terminology . Many even of the minor poems belong to realms of thought and experience so remote that only by distinct effort do we transport ourselves thither . It would , for instance , be absurd to call “ Two in the Campagna ” difficult in form or phrasing , yet it narrates an experience intelligible only to those who have loved deeply but have found in the very heart of that love a baffling sense of inevitable personal isolation . Sometimes the difficulty arises from the extreme subtlety of the thought . “ Evelyn Hope , ” the simplest of poems in expression , presents novel and elusive ideas . Mr. Chesterton ingeniously ascribes Browning 's obscurity to “ intellectual humility , ” to an assumption that his readers were in possession of a native endowment and an acquired intellectual wealth on a par with his own ; but the defense seems rather forced . Mrs. Browning gave one of the best brief analyses of Mr. Browning 's obscurity . He had been attacked as being “ misty ” and she wrote to him , “ You never are misty , not even in ‘ Sordello ’ — never vague . Your graver cuts deep , sharp lines , always — and there is an extra distinctness in your images and thoughts , from the midst of which , crossing each other infinitely , the general significance seems to escape . ” But the classic defense of Browning from this point of view may be found in Swinburne 's Introduction to Chapman 's Poems :</p>
   <p>“ The difficulty found by many in certain of Mr. Browning 's works arises from a quality the very reverse of that which produces obscurity , properly so-called . Obscurity is the natural product of turbid forces and confused ideas ; of a feeble and clouded or of a vigorous but unfixed and chaotic intellect .... Now if there is any great quality more perceptible than another in Mr. Browning 's intellect it is his decisive and incisive faculty of thought , his sureness and intensity of perception , his rapid and trenchant resolution of aim .... The very essence of Mr. Browning 's aim and method , as exhibited in the ripest fruits of his intelligence , is such as implies above all other things the possession of a quality the very opposite of obscurity — a faculty of spiritual illumination rapid and intense and subtle as lightning , which brings to bear upon its object by way of direct and vivid illustration every symbol and every detail on which its light is flashed in passing . ” Browning has himself a word to say on this topic . He wrote to a friend :</p>
   <p>“ I can have little doubt that my writing has been in the main too hard for many I should have been pleased to communicate with ; but I never designedly tried to puzzle people as some of my critics have supposed . On the other hand , I never pretended to offer such literature as should be a substitute for a cigar or a game at dominoes to an idle man . So , perhaps , on the whole , I get my deserts , and something over — not a crowd but a few I value more . ”</p>
   <p>A second charge not infrequently brought against Browning 's verse is that it is harsh , and at times even ugly . This charge , like that of obscurity , cannot be wholly denied . The harshness results from incorrect rhymes , from irregular movement of the verse , or from difficult combinations of vowels and consonants . No reader of Browning 's poems can fail to have been impressed by his intellectual agility in matching odd rhymes . In dash and originality his rhymes out-rank even those in Butler 's Hudibras and Lowell 's Fable for Critics . We find in Pacchiarotto , for instance , many rhymes of the gayest , most freakish , most grotesque character — “ monkey , one key , ” “ prelude , hell-hued , ” “ stubborn , cub-born , ” “ was hard , hazard , ” all occur in a single stanza . An example of exceptional facility in rhyming is found in “ Through the Metidja , ” where , without repetition of words and without forcing of the sense thirty-six words rhyme with “ ride . ” It cannot be denied that this remarkable facility led Browning occasionally into the use of odd rhymes in poems where no light or comic effect was intended ; but a detailed study of his rhymes<span corresp="#note7" type="note_anchor">[ 7 ]</span>shows that the proportion of incorrect rhymes is really small , that the grotesque rhymes are more striking than numerous , and that they are usually in places where they are dramatically appropriate . His use of harsh words and sound-blendings is also often to be justified on the ground of their appropriateness to the idea . Compare , for instance , the flowing , easy words , the musical linking of sounds , in the first stanza of “ Love Among the Ruins ” with the harsh words , harshly combined , in the twelfth and thirteenth stanzas of “ Childe Roland . ” Both effects are artistic because each sort of combination is in response to the nature of the thought . It is true that sometimes , perhaps not infrequently , the verse is rugged or uncouth where the sense does not call for such form , and there are lines that not only remind us of De Quincey 's dictum that certain words should be “ boiled before they are eaten , ” but which have no metrical flow at all ; they defy any sort of scansion and read like rough prose . But a poet has a right of appeal to the sum of his manifest excellencies rather than to his defects , and if we take Browning 's best work we find a harmony of movement superior in musical effect to a more technically regular meter . In many poems the meter is indissolubly fused with the pictures , the ideas , the events . Take , for instance , “ The Pied Piper of Hamelin , ” where the hurry-skurry of the verse is in complete harmony with the quaint , rapid tale . The hoof-beats of galloping horses is heard all through “ How They Brought the Good News from Ghent to Aix . ” The slow march , the stately chant , are rhythmically present throughout “ A Grammarian 's Funeral . ” In “ The Flight of the Duchess ” the change from the rough servitor 's narrative to the incantation of the gypsy-queen is as exquisitely marked in the metrical movement and in the rhymes as it is in the diction and tone of thought . Many other examples might be cited . Mr. Brinton , who has made a detailed and competent study of Browning 's verse , gives his final opinion in these words : “ In the volumes of Browning I maintain that we find so many instances of profound insight into verbal harmonies , such singular strength of poetic grouping , and such a marvelous grasp of the rhythmic properties of the English language that we must assign to him a rank second to no English poet of this century . "[ 8 ]</p>
   <p>A third charge brought against Browning 's art is that he makes all his characters talk “ Browningese ” ; that is , that he endows all of them with the power to use such words and sentences and thought processes as are natural to him and to him only . Mr. Stedman in emphasizing this characteristic of the poet says of Pippa Passes : “ The usual fault is present — the characters , whether students , peasants , or soldiers , all talk like sages ; Pippa reasons like a Paracelsus in pantalettes . ” It is , of course , obvious at the first glance that there is a lack of verisimilitude in Pippa 's rich and beautiful soliloquies . Certainly no fourteen-year-old mill girl could so describe a sunrise , or play so brilliantly with a sunbeam in a water-basin , or outline so cleverly the stories of the happiest four in Asolo . The same is true of Phene 's long speech to Jules ; no untutored girl brought up in degradation , could present such thoughts in such words . When we analyze Browning 's way of presenting a character , however , we find that the lack of verisimilitude is usually external and has to do chiefly with expression . Browning works on the fundamental assumption that he has a poetic right to make all sorts of people articulate . He lends his mind out in the service of their thoughts and feelings . He makes people reveal themselves by putting into words their elusive , dim , tangled , and even unrecognized motives and hopes and joys and despairs . He sums up in the speeches all the potentialities of the situation . All the significance latent in the type of character and environment is somehow heightened and symbolized . All this is put in his own highly individual diction . Yet it can hardly be said that he violates poetic realism in the deeper sense , for he never puts a halo around a situation , never goes counter to its potentialities . Instead he strikes fire from it . He shows what is actually in the situation , but at white heat and laid bare to its center . When this method has once been recognized , discomfort on the score of lack of verisimilitude practically disappears , and the reader yields himself to the joy of the rich , subtle , and stimulating analysis .</p>
   <p>We may now turn to a consideration of the subject-matter and the main ideas of Browning 's poetry . From whatever point of view we regard his work , we find that ultimately the emphasis rests on the same great central fact , the supremacy of his interest in human nature . This dominating interest is shown , for instance , by a study of his treatment of physical nature . To be sure , no one can read his poems without recognizing the truth that his use of natural facts is distinctive in kind and very stimulating . A mere reference to the pictures of the sky in Pippa Passes , the vivid descriptions of fruits and flowers in “ An Englishman in Italy , ” the remarkable studies of small animal life in “ Saul ” and “ Caliban upon Setebos , ” of birds in “ Home-Thoughts , from Abroad , ” of insects in the first part of Paracelsus and in many later poems , suffices to show that in mature life he did not lose the keenness of observation and interest characteristic of his youth . Yet it is also evident that his use of nature by way of direct description , or even as illustrative material , is far less in amount than that of other notable nineteenth century poets . He cares much less for “ the river 's line , the mountains round it and the sky above ” than for the “ figures of man , woman , and child these are frame to . ” Where nature is drawn upon , it is almost invariably in complete subordination to some human interest , and its literary form is almost always that of casual mention , background , or similitude , and the first of these is the most frequent . Furthermore , nearly all these passages are a mere statement of observed fact without comment or interpretation . There is one great passage in Paracelsus where the joy of God in the act of creation is depicted ; there are occasional references to the delight of man in the external world ; and now and then , as in “ By the Fireside , ” man and nature are intimately fused ; but such conceptions rarely occur . In Browning 's poetry the boundary lines between man and nature are clearly marked . In Paracelsus he definitely protests against man 's way of reading his own moods into nature , and of attributing to her his own qualities and emotions . He also always accounts man , if he has truly entered into his spiritual heritage , as consciously superior to nature . The troubadour Eglamour , in Sordello , says that man shrinks to naught if matched with a quiet sea or sky , but Browning calls that Eglamour 's “ false thought . ” To Browning , nature was to be studied , enjoyed , and used , but it was not as to Keats a realm of enchantment ; or as to Wordsworth the realm where alone the divine and the human could pass the boundaries of sense and meet ; or as to Matthew Arnold a refuge from pain and disillusionment . Browning regards the world about him more in the sane , unsentimental , straightforward , intelligible way of Chaucer or of Shakespeare . The mystical elements in Wordsworth 's feeling for nature were foreign to Browning 's mind . An instructive comparison might be made between Wordsworth 's “ Ode on Intimations of Immortality ” and Browning 's “ Prologue to Asolando . ” The poems have the same starting point . Each one attributes sadness to the poet 's old age , and each gives as a cause of the sadness the inevitable fading of the glory with which all nature was invested to the eye of his youth . But here the resemblance ends . Wordsworth believes that the youthful vision was a divine revelation to be regained when the round of existence should be completed by a return to his immortal home , and on the memory of that vision he founded his faith in a future life . But Browning welcomed the loss of the vision . Objects had been to him “ palpably fire-clothed ” ; but with the loss of “ flame ” there was a gain in reality . The vision had enthralled and subjugated him ; but with the sight of “ a naked world ” he had become conscious of things as they are , and he rejoiced in a justness of perception that declared what were to him the two great facts of life , the power and beauty of God , and the glory of the human soul . On these , not on nature , he put his stress .</p>
   <p>Browning 's paramount interest in human nature is further illustrated by his poems on the various arts . Of music , painting , and sculpture he has written with the intimate and minute knowledge of a specialist in each art . He is familiar with implements and materials , with the tricks of the trade , the talk of the studios ; but , after all , the art as an art is of much less interest to him than is the worker . The process and even the completed product are in Browning 's view important only in so far as they reveal or affect the artist , the musician , the sculptor , or some phase of life . In such poems as “ Abt Vogler , ” “ Fra Lippo Lippi , ” “ Andrea del Sarto , ” we are conscious not so much of music and pictures as of the secret springs of failure , the divine despairs and discontents , the aspirations , the creative ecstasies , of the men who wrought in these realms . Andrea del Sarto 's art is not the real theme of the poem bearing his name . It is , rather , his character , of which his art is an expression . The central fact of the poem is the recognition that a soul morally impoverished cannot , even with well-nigh perfect technique , produce great work , while , even with faulty technique , a setting of the soul to grand issues will secure transcendent meanings . So , too , with Abt Vogler . His music is not of the greatest , but our concern is with the musician who , through the completeness of his spiritual absorption in music , is conducted into a realm of experience beyond that of speech or even of articulate thought .</p>
   <p>Another distinctly human aspect of art interests Browning , and that is its power to represent and so to recall a vanished civilization . Greek statues , the devotional pictures of the early Florentines , the work of the later Italian realists , stand , in “ Old Pictures in Florence , ” as representatives of the life and thought that produced them . In “ A Toccata of Galuppi 's ” the music revivifies the superficial gaiety , the undertone of fear , in the life of eighteenth century Venice . Highly significant in this connection are the poems in which he traces the evolution of art . Running through “ Old Pictures in Florence ” and “ Fra Lippo Lippi ” we find an ordered statement of the chief changes in the ideals of art as Browning saw them . The Greeks , we are told , had produced in sculpture the most beautiful representations of the human body . But if their successors had been content merely to admire this perfect achievement , they would have purchased satisfaction at the price of their own arrested development . Progress came only when , in the dawn of Italian art , men turned from Greek perfection , from the supremely beautiful but limited representations of the human body , to an attempt to paint the invisible , the spiritual side of man 's nature . The work of these artists was great because it was not imitative and because it stretched toward an unending and ideal future . But the idealistic and aspiring temper of early Tuscan art had the defects of its qualities . Its spiritual ecstasy once conventionalized and reduced to a formula led to unreality , and , if not to untruth , at least to an unwholesome ignoring of a part of truth . There was , therefore , an inevitable reaction to the naturalism described with such verve and gusto by Fra Lippo Lippi . But this is , after all , social history in terms of art , and to Browning what has happened in painting is of value chiefly as showing concretely what has happened in the mind of man .</p>
   <p>From the instances already cited it is apparent that Browning 's interest centered , not in abstract or theoretical discussions of human problems , but in the individuals who face the problems . In this point Browning is sharply distinguished from his poetic contemporaries as a class . They felt deeply “ all the weary weight of this unintelligible world , ” so deeply that while they gave much thought to ideals of social amelioration , few of them presented individuals with any dramatic distinctness . Browning stands practically by himself in the nineteenth century as the poet who gives us both the “ doubter and the doubt , ” who is able to join with an impressive statement of the hopes and fears of man , an equally impressive sequence of individual men and women . In this he harks back to the broad inclusiveness of the Elizabethan dramatists . In contemporary literature , his nearest congeners are in fiction , not in poetry .</p>
   <p>The great number and variety of Browning 's characters can be illustrated in different ways . We might , for instance , note how many nationalities are represented . The personages in “ Stafford ” and the “ Cavalier Tunes ” are Englishmen from the time of the Civil War . “ Clive ” is a true story of the Indian Empire . We have from Italian life the numerous characters in Sordello , “ Fra Lippo Lippi , ” “ Pictor Ignotus , ” “ The Bishop Orders His Tomb at St. Praxed 's Church , ” “ My Last Duchess , ” The Ring and the Book , “ A Grammarian 's Funeral , ” “ Up at a Villa — Down in the City , ” “ In a Gondola , ” and many more . “ Count Gismond ” and “ Hervé Riel ” are French stories . Paracelsus and “ Abt Vogler ” are of German origin . Balaustion 's Adventure , Aristophanes ’ Apology , “ Pheidippides , ” and “ Echetlos ” celebrate Greek thought and adventure . Very important poems such as “ Saul ” and “ Rabbi Ben Ezra , ” have to do with Jewish life . And unlike Shakespeare , who is not concerned with making Julius Cæsar a Roman or Duke Theseus a Greek , Browning brings to the creation of each of these widely divergent characters , a detailed knowledge of the special habits of life and thought of the nation or race concerned . He represents also many kinds of human interest . We find in his poems seekers after knowledge such as Paracelsus , who takes all thought and fact as his domain ; or such as the Grammarian , who found Greek particles too wide a realm ; or such as the pedant Sibrandus Schafnaburgensis , whose learned rubbish cumbers the land . There are likewise those who grope after the truths of religion from Caliban on his island to the learned physician Karshish and the highly cultured Cleon ; those who have the full vision from John to Rabbi Ben Ezra ; those who juggle with terms and creeds as does Bishop Blougram ; and out and out frauds like Sludge the Medium . The church is represented by many men dissimilar in endowments , tastes , spiritual experiences , and aims . There are Italian prelates of every sort , from the worldly-minded Bishop of St. Praxed 's , occupied in death with vain thoughts of lapis-lazuli and pure Latin , to the “ soldier-saint , ” Caponsacchi , who saved Pompilia , and the wise old Pope who pronounced Guido 's doom ; from the unworthy priest in the Spanish Cloister to the very human , kindly Pope in “ The Bean Feast . ” And from all these it is far down the ages to the evangelical parish priest of The Inn Album , that “ purblind honest drudge , ” who , the deeper to impress his flock , painted heaven dimly but “ made hell distinct . ” There are many artists , many musicians . There are poets from Aprile in Paracelsus , and the troubadours Eglamour and Sordello , to Keats and Shelley . The extremes of social life are given . There are the street-girls in Pippa Passes and there are kings and queens with royal retinues . There are statesmen , and warriors , and seekers after romantic adventure . There are haughty aristocrats of cold and cruel natures , and there are obscure but high-hearted doers of heroic deeds . Browning 's dictum , “ Study man , man , whatever the issue , ” led him into a world wider than that known by any other poet of his time , and akin , as has been pointed out , to that of the great writers of fiction . As an observer of human life he was not unlike his poor poet of Valladolid who , with his “ scrutinizing hat , ” went about the streets , absorbed in watching all kinds of people , all sorts of occupations , “ scenting the world , looking it full in the face . ” He chose to set forth “ the wants and ways ” of actual life . He summed up his work in the “ Epilogue to Pacchiarotto ":</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Man 's thoughts and loves and hates !</l>
     <l n="2">Earth is my vineyard , these grew there :</l>
     <l n="3">From grape of the ground I made or marred</l>
     <l n="4">My vintage .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>It is further apparent that Browning 's characters are never merely types , but must always be reckoned with as individuals . It was his belief that no two beings were ever made similar in head and heart ; hence , even where there are external similarities the essential elements are strongly differentiated . Take , for instance , three poems in which the situations are not unlike . In “ My Last Duchess , ” “ The Flight of the Duchess , ” and The Ring and the Book , we have a portrayal of three men of high lineage , but cold , egotistic , cruel , who have married very young and lovely women over whom the custom of the times gives them absolute power . But there the likeness ends . We cannot for a moment class together the polished , aesthetic , well-bred aristocrat of the first poem , the absurd little popinjay of the second , and the “ tiger-cat ” of the third . Less strongly , but as clearly are the wives differentiated . To the innocent gaiety of heart , the bright , sweet friendliness of the hapless lady in “ My Last Duchess ” must be added for the lady in “ The Flight of the Duchess ” a native force of character which , when roused by the call of the gypsy-queen , enables her to break the yoke imposed on her by the Duke and his mother and go forth into a life of adventure , freedom , and love . The delicate , flower-like Pompilia in The Ring and the Book has also power to initiate and carry through a plan of escape , but her incentive is no call to romantic freedom . Her passive endurance changes to active revolt only when motive and energy are supplied by her love for her child . Or take Pippa and Phene in Pippa Passes , two beautiful young girls brought up in dangerous and evil surroundings , but both innately pure . In character and experience they are , however , as unlike as two girls could be . Phene , undeveloped in mind and heart , the easily duped agent of a cruel trick , appeals to us by her slow , incredulous , but eager response to goodness and aspiration , the tremulous opening of her soul to love . But Pippa , with her observant love of nature , her gay , sportive , winsome fancies , her imaginative sympathy with the lives of others , her knowledge of good and evil , her poise , her bright steadiness of soul , carries us into a different and much more highly evolved world of thought and feeling . So we might go through the great assemblage of Browning 's characters to find that each one stands out by himself as a person with his own qualities , possibilities , and problems .</p>
   <p>In all this portrayal of individuals the emphasis is on things of the mind and heart . In these realms Browning found nothing alien or uninteresting . From point to point his poetry illustrates what he said in his comment on Sordello , “ My stress lay on the incidents in the development of a human soul ; little else is worth study . ” In all his poetry environment is of importance only in so far as it is the stuff on which the soul works . It is “ the subtle thing called spirit , ” it is “ the soul 's world ” to which he devotes himself .</p>
   <p>It is only from a study of Browning 's many characters that we may arrive at a statement of some of the distinguishing features of his philosophy of life . And any such statements must be made with extreme caution because of his dramatic method . He utters this caution himself when he says of his poems , “ Their contents are always dramatic in principle , and so many utterances of so many imaginary people . ” Yet it is possible , by taking the general trend and scope of his work , to make justifiable deductions concerning the dominant ideas in the rich field of his poetry and drama .</p>
   <p>In Browning 's philosophy of life , words of especial significance are “ growth ” and “ progress . ” Domizia in Luria says :</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">How inexhaustibly the spirit grows !</l>
     <l n="2">One object , she seemed erewhile born to reach</l>
     <l n="3">With her whole energies and die content —</l>
     <l n="4">So like a wall at the world 's edge is stood ,</l>
     <l n="5">With naught beyond to live for — is that reached ?—</l>
     <l n="6">Already are new undreamed energies</l>
     <l n="7">Outgrowing under , and extending farther</l>
     <l n="8">To a new object .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">So , too , John in “ A Death in the Desert ” sums up his belief in the line ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="10">I say that man was made to grow , not stop .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Growth here and growth hereafter are the essential elements of Browning 's creed . And there is no other poet in whom all kinds of thinking and doing are so uniformly tested by their outcome in the growth of the soul . Does joy stimulate to fuller life ; does suffering bring out moral qualities ; do obstacles develop energy ; do sharp temptations become a source of strength and assured soldiership ; does knowledge of evil lead to a new exaltation of good ; does sin lead to self-knowledge and so to regeneration ? Then all these are ministers of grace , for through them the soul has reached greater heights and fuller life . Whatever bids the soul “ nor stand nor sit , but go ” is to be welcomed . The cost of this growth may be great , but the advances of spirit are represented as worth any sacrifice . The lady in “ The Flight of the Duchess ” goes from splendor and ease to hardship and obscurity , but she wins freedom of thought and of act and the opportunity to test the qualities of her soul . In Pippa Passes Sebald might have had love and wealth , Jules might have attained fame along the conventional path marked out for him by the Monsignor , Luigi had the prospect of an easy life and happy love , the Monsignor might have had enhanced honor from the church into whose coffers he could have turned great revenues . But instead each responds in turn to Pippa 's songs ; Sebald gains a true view of sin , Jules gets a new conception of service and attainment , Luigi 's wavering purpose of self-sacrifice for his country 's good is strengthened , the Monsignor is held back from connivance at a crime . In all these cases the external loss is as nothing compared to the gain in spiritual knowledge and energy .</p>
   <p>Contact with magnetic and superior personalities is a way of growth particularly noted by Browning . There are men , he says , who bring new feeling fresh from God , and whose life “ reteaches us what life should be , what faith is , loyalty and simpleness . ” Pompilia says of Caponsacchi :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Through such souls alone</l>
     <l n="2">God stooping shows sufficient of his light</l>
     <l n="3">For us i ’ the dark to rise by .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The highest souls are “ seers ” in the noblest sense and they “ impart the gift of seeing to the rest . ” But the helpful personality need not be great in knowledge or rank . In Pippa Browning emphasizes the power of unconscious goodness in clarifying the spiritual vision of others and in thus stimulating to right action . And in David he shows the power of poetic charm , innocence , and eager love to drive away from another heart a mood of black despair .</p>
   <p>But outside influences are , after all , says Browning , of secondary importance . They can , at best , do no more than stimulate and guide . When Andrea del Sarto attributes his general lowering of ideals and power to the influence of Lucrezia , he evades the real issue . Incentives must come from the soul 's self . Growth is dependent on personal struggle . Man is , by his very nature ,</p>
   <p>forced to try and make , else fail to grow — Formed to rise , reach at , if not grasp and gain The good beyond him — which attempt is growth .</p>
   <p>So , also , is it better that youth</p>
   <p>should strive , through acts uncouth , Toward making , than repose on aught found made .</p>
   <p>It is in the independence and originality of such striving that the soul discovers and frees its innate potentialities .</p>
   <p>An inevitable corollary of this idea of progress is the emphasis put upon aspiration as a habit of the mind . The pursuit of an ideal , a divine discontent with present accomplishment , are enjoined upon man . The gleams of heaven on earth are not meant to be permanent or satisfying , but only to sting man into hunger for full light . When a human being has achieved to the full extent of his perceptions or aspirations , he has , thinks Browning , met with the greatest possible disaster , that of arrested development . Man 's powers should ever climb new heights . For his soul 's health he should always see “ a flying point of bliss remote , a happiness in store afar , a sphere of distant glory . ” “ A man 's reach should exceed his grasp , or what 's a heaven for ? ” According to this ideal , man 's conception of good is ever changing and ever widening and hence never in this life to be fully attained ; yet the condition of growth is that he have an unmeasured thirst for good and that he pursue it with unquenchable ardor .</p>
   <p>The importance of love as one of the most effective agencies in spiritual growth is stated and restated in Browning 's poetry and by exceedingly diverse characters . The Queen in In a Balcony turns away from her lonely splendor to exclaim ,</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">There is no good of life but love — but love !</l>
     <l n="2">What else looks good is some shade flung from love ;</l>
     <l n="3">Love gilds it , gives it worth .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="4">The Duchess learns from the gypsy</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="5">How love is the only good in the world .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>The famous singer in “ Dis Aliter Visum ” knows that art , verse , music , count as naught beside “ love found , gained , and kept . ” Browning seems to regard almost any genuine love as a means of opening out the nature to fuller self-knowledge , to wider sympathies , and to increased power of action . Hence he condemns all cautious calculation of obstacles , all dwelling upon conventional difficulties , in the path of those who have clearly seen “ the love-way . ” Hence even love unrequited is counted of inestimable value . In Colombe 's Birthday Valence says ,</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Is the knowledge of her , naught ? the memory , naught ?</l>
     <l n="2">— Lady , should such an one have looked on you ,</l>
     <l n="3">Ne'er wrong yourself so far as quote the world</l>
     <l n="4">And say , love can go unrequited here !</l>
     <l n="5">You will have blessed him to his whole life 's end —</l>
     <l n="6">Low passions hindered , baser cares kept back ,</l>
     <l n="7">All goodness cherished where you dwelt — and dwell .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>But the love of man and woman is not the only sort . A part of the value of this individual relationship is that it may be regarded as a revelation and symbol of the spirit of all-embracing sympathy whereby mankind should be ruled . When Paracelsus analyzes his life he ascribes his failure to the fact that he has sought knowledge to the exclusion of all else ; he finally came to see that knowledge , however profound , is of itself barren of satisfaction . He had meant to serve men by revealing truth to them , but he found that real service is based on the understanding given by love . In self condemnation he says ,</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">In my own heart love had not been made wise</l>
     <l n="2">To trace love 's faint beginnings in mankind ,</l>
     <l n="3">To know even hate is but a mask of love 's .</l>
     <l n="4">To see a good in evil , and a hope</l>
     <l n="5">In ill-success ; to sympathize , be proud</l>
     <l n="6">Of their half-reasons , faint aspirings , dim</l>
     <l n="7">Struggles for truth , their poorest fallacies ,</l>
     <l n="8">Their prejudice and fears and cares and doubts ;</l>
     <l n="9">All with a touch of nobleness , despite</l>
     <l n="10">Their error , upward tending all though weak .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Browning 's conception of the function and power of love is based on his belief in its divine origin . Twice at least , in “ Easter Day ” and “ Saul , ” his characters work out from an overpowering recognition of God 's omniscience and omnipotence to a final recognition that his love is equal in scope with his power and knowledge . And he counts human service as most complete when , as in David before Saul , it reaches out to God 's love and recruits its failing forces from the divine source .</p>
   <p>Underlying Browning 's doctrine of the value of love , and his doctrine of progress and aspiration , is his belief in personal immortality . When he was charged with being strongly against Darwin , with rejecting the truths of science and regretting its advance , he answered that the idea of a progressive development from senseless matter until man 's appearance had been a familiar conception to him from the beginning , but he reiterated his constant faith in creative intelligence acting on matter but not resulting from it . “ Soul , ” he said , “ is not matter , nor from matter , but above . ” Two assumptions which though not susceptible of proof he regards as “ inescapable , ” are the existence of creative intelligence and of “ the subtle thing called spirit . ” When he argues out the question of the immortality of this spirit , as in La Saisiaz , he admits the subjective character of the evidence ; but when he speaks spontaneously out of his own feeling or experience , it is with positive belief in life after death . To Mr. Sharp he said , “ Death , death ! It is this harping on death that I do despise so much ! Why , amico mio , you know as well as I that death is life , just as our daily , our momentarily dying body is none the less alive and ever recruiting new forces of existence . Without death which is our crape-like church-yardy word for change , for growth , there could be no prolongation of what we call life . Pshaw , it is foolish to argue upon such a thing , even . For myself , I deny death as an end of everything . Never say of me that I am dead ! ” When his wife died he wrote in her Testament these words from Dante , “ Thus I believe , thus I affirm , thus I am certain it is , that from this life I shall pass to another better there where that lady lives of whom my soul was enamored . ” This faith in life after death explains much of Browning 's philosophy . The source of the pagan Cleon 's profound discouragement was the fact that man should be dowered with “ joy-hunger , ” should be given the ability to perceive and comprehend splendor and breadth of experience , but should , through the straitness of human limitations , be held back from satisfaction and achievement , and should be left to die thus dazzled , thus baffled . The secret of Browning 's optimism , on the other hand , is his belief that in heaven the soul is freed from limitations , and blossoms out into capabilities of joy and of activity beyond anything suggested by the most golden dreams of earth . To him all life is a unit , beginning here and destined to unimaginable development hereafter . Earth is regarded as a place of tutelage where man may learn to set foot on some one path to heaven . And no work begun here shall ever pause for death . Even apparent failure here counts for little so the quest be not abandoned . Each of us may , as Abt Vogler , look without despair on the broken arcs of earth if his faith reveals the perfect round in heaven .</p>
   <p>From any prolonged study of Browning 's poetry we become conscious of certain dominant qualities of style that may be thought of quite apart from his themes or message . That his style has the defect of its qualities has already been pointed out . Here we may appropriately indicate those qualities as positive elements of his power . His diction , rich alike in the most learned words and the most colloquial , is responsive to all demands . His power of phrasing runs the whole gamut from the most pellucid simplicity to the most triumphant originality . His figures of speech , drawn from all realms , are penetrating in quality , of startling aptness . Equally characteristic is his versification , varying as it does from passages of melodic smoothness and grace to lines as strident , broken , and harsh as the thought they dramatically reflect . In narration , whether in the brilliant rapidity and ease of a short poem like “ Hervé Riel ” or in the sustained flow of a long story like that of Pompilia , we find unusual skill . In disquisition , in the presentation of complicated and elusive intellectual processes , there is a quite unmatched agility and dexterity . Probably no two forms of poetry contain more of Browning 's most noteworthy work than the lyric , especially the reflective love lyric , and that form which is distinctively his own , the dramatic monologue . In his best poems in this last form he has no competitor . It is in the presentation of character through the medium of dramatic monologue that he most fully reveals the unerring precision of his analysis , his lightning glance into the heart of a mystery , the ease with which he tracks a motive or mood or thought to its last hiding place , and his consequent passion and fire of sympathy or scorn .</p>
   <p>Finally , whether we consider Browning 's style or subject matter or philosophy of life , we become growingly conscious of his force . The “ clear Virgilian line ” of Tennyson is the outcome of a nature instinctively aristocratic and aloof . Browning is out in the thick of the fight and almost vociferously demands a hearing . Whatever makes his thought clear , vivid , active , forcible , seems to him , however prosaic it may appear at first glance , proper poetic material . The immediate effect of his verse is the rousing of the mind to great issues . His tremendous sincerity results in a dispelling of mists , a stripping off of husks . His demand for the truth is a trumpet note of challenge to our doubt or fear or indifference . His penetrating study of human problems leads to an inevitable widening of the horizon of comprehension and sympathy on the part of his readers . And his courage and optimism constitute an inspiration and stimulus of an uncommonly virile sort .</p>
   <p>It has been said that Browning is “ not a poet , but a literature , ” and in work so vast and varied that it can be thus characterized there must be wide extremes of value . It is almost certain that portions of his work cannot live . They are too difficult , too unliterary . But in the portions where great thought finds adequate form , the product is a priceless gift and one not equaled by any other poet of his age .</p>

     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="5">
      <l n="19">Over the sea our galleys went</l>
      <l n="20">With cleaving prows in order brave</l>
      <l n="21">To a speeding wind and a bounding wave —</l>
      <l n="22">A gallant armament ; 20</l>
      <l n="23">Each bark built out of a forest-tree</l>
      <l n="24">Left leafy and rough as first it grew ,</l>
      <l n="25">And nailed all over the gaping sides ,</l>
      <l n="26">Within and without , with black bull-hides ,</l>
      <l n="27">Seethed in fat and suppled in flame , 25</l>
      <l n="28">To bear the playful billows ’ game .</l>
      <l n="29">So each good ship was rude to see ,</l>
      <l n="30">Rude and bare to the outward view ,</l>
      <l n="31">But each upbore a stately tent</l>
      <l n="32">Where cedar pales in scented row 30</l>
      <l n="33">Kept out the flakes of the dancing brine ,</l>
      <l n="34">And an awning drooped the mast below ,</l>
      <l n="35">In fold on fold of the purple fine ,</l>
      <l n="36">That neither noontide nor starshine</l>
      <l n="37">Nor moonlight cold which maketh mad , 35</l>
      <l n="38">Might pierce the regal tenement .</l>
      <l n="39">When the sun dawned , oh , gay and glad</l>
      <l n="40">We set the sail and plied the oar ;</l>
      <l n="41">But when the night-wind blew like breath ,</l>
      <l n="42">For joy of one day 's voyage more , 40</l>
      <l n="43">We sang together on the wide sea ,</l>
      <l n="44">Like men at peace on a peaceful shore ;</l>
      <l n="45">Each sail was loosed to the wind so free ,</l>
      <l n="46">Each helm made sure by the twilight star ,</l>
      <l n="47">And in a sleep as calm as death , 45</l>
      <l n="48">We , the voyagers from afar ,</l>
      <l n="49">Lay stretched along , each weary crew</l>
      <l n="50">In a circle round its wondrous tent</l>
      <l n="51">Whence gleamed soft light and curled rich scent ,</l>
      <l n="52">And with light and perfume , music too . 50</l>
      <l n="53">So the stars wheeled round , and the darkness passed ,</l>
      <l n="54">And at morn we started beside the mast ,</l>
      <l n="55">And still each ship was sailing fast .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="6">
      <l n="56">Now one morn land appeared — a speck</l>
      <l n="57">Dim trembling betwixt sea and sky . 55</l>
      <l n="58">“ Avoid it , ” cried our pilot , “ check</l>
      <l n="59">The shout , restrain the eager eye ! ”</l>
      <l n="60">But the heaving sea was black behind</l>
      <l n="61">For many a night and many a day ,</l>
      <l n="62">And land , though but a rock , drew nigh ; 60</l>
      <l n="63">So we broke the cedar pales away ,</l>
      <l n="64">Let the purple awning flap in the wind ,</l>
      <l n="65">And a statue bright was on every deck !</l>
      <l n="66">We shouted , every man of us ,</l>
      <l n="67">And steered right into the harbor thus , 65</l>
      <l n="68">With pomp and pæan glorious .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="7">
      <l n="69">A hundred shapes of lucid stone !</l>
      <l n="70">All day we built its shrine for each ,</l>
      <l n="71">A shrine of rock for everyone ,</l>
      <l n="72">Nor paused till in the westering sun 70</l>
      <l n="73">We sat together on the beach</l>
      <l n="74">To sing because our task was done .</l>
      <l n="75">When lo ! what shouts and merry songs !</l>
      <l n="76">What laughter all the distance stirs !</l>
      <l n="77">A loaded raft with happy throngs 75</l>
      <l n="78">Of gentle islanders !</l>
      <l n="79">“ Our isles are just at hand , ” they cried ,</l>
      <l n="80">“ Like cloudlets faint in even sleeping ;</l>
      <l n="81">Our temple-gates are opened wide ,</l>
      <l n="82">Our olive-groves thick shade are keeping 80</l>
      <l n="83">For these majestic forms ” — they cried .</l>
      <l n="84">Oh , then we awoke with sudden start</l>
      <l n="85">From our deep dream , and knew , too late ,</l>
      <l n="86">How bare the rock , how desolate ,</l>
      <l n="87">Which had received our precious freight . 85</l>
      <l n="88">Yet we called out — “ Depart !</l>
      <l n="89">Our gifts once given must here abide .</l>
      <l n="90">Our work is done ; we have no heart</l>
      <l n="91">To mar our work ” — we cried .</l>

      <l n="100">Bears not on its shaven ledge</l>
      <l n="101">Aught but weeds and waving grasses</l>

      <l n="104">Of primroses too faint to catch</l>

      <l n="106">And scarce it pushes</l>

      <l n="109">Flutters when noon-heats are near , 105</l>
      <l n="110">Glad the shelving banks to shun ,</l>
      <l n="111">Red and steaming in the sun ,</l>
      <l n="112">Where the shrew-mouse with pale throat</l>
      <l n="113">Burrows , and the speckled stoat ;</l>
      <l n="114">Where the quick sandpipers flit 110</l>
      <l n="115">In and out the marl and grit</l>
      <l n="116">That seems to breed them , brown as they .</l>
      <l n="117">Naught disturbs its quiet way ,</l>
      <l n="118">Save some lazy stork that springs ,</l>
      <l n="119">Trailing it with legs and wings , 115</l>
      <l n="120">Whom the shy fox from the hill</l>

     <l n="15">Houses in four straight lines , not a single front awry ;</l>
     <l n="16">You watch who crosses and gossips , who saunters , who hurries by ;</l>
     <l n="17">Green blinds , as a matter of course , to draw when the sun gets 15</l>
     <l n="18">high ;</l>

    <head>A TOCCATA OF GALUPPI 'S</head>
     <l n="1">O Galuppi , Baldassare , this is very sad to find !</l>
     <l n="2">I can hardly misconceive you ; it would prove me deaf and blind ;</l>
     <l n="3">But although I take your meaning , ‘ tis with such a heavy mind !</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Here you come with your old music , and here 's all the good it brings . What , they lived once thus at Venice where the merchants were 5 the kings , Where Saint Mark 's is , where the Doges used to wed the sea with rings ?</p>
   <p>Aye , because the sea 's the street there ; and ‘ tis arched by ... what you call Shylock 's bridge with houses on it , where they kept the carnival ; I was never out of England — it 's as if I saw it all .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Did young people take their pleasure when the sea was warm in 10</l>
     <l n="2">May ?</l>
     <l n="3">Balls and masks begun at midnight , burning ever to mid-day ,</l>
     <l n="4">When they made up fresh adventures for the morrow , do you say ?</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Was a lady such a lady , cheeks so round and lips so red — On her neck the small face buoyant , like a bell-flower on its bed , O'er the breast 's superb abundance where a man might base his 15 head ?</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Well , and it was graceful of them — they 'd break talk off and afford</l>
     <l n="2">— She , to bite her mask 's black velvet — he , to finger on his sword ,</l>
     <l n="3">While you sat and played Toccatas , stately at the clavichord ?</l>
   </lg>
   <p>What ? Those lesser thirds so plaintive , sixths diminished , sigh on sigh , Told them something ? Those suspensions , those solutions — “ Must 20 we die ? ” Those commiserating sevenths — “ Life might last ! we can but try ! ”</p>
   <p>“ Were you happy ? ” — “ Yes . ” — “ And are you still as happy ? ” — “ Yes . And you ? ” — “ Then , more kisses ! ” — “ Did I stop them , when a million seemed so few ? ” Hark , the dominant 's persistence till it must be answered to !</p>
   <p>So an octave struck the answer . Oh , they praised you , I dare 25 say ! “ Brave Galuppi ! that was music ! good alike at grave and gay ! I can always leave off talking when I hear a master play ! ”</p>
   <p>Then they left you for their pleasure ; till in due time , one by one , Some with lives that came to nothing , some with deeds as well undone , Death stepped tacitly and took them where they never see the 30 sun .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">But when I sit down to reason , think to take my stand nor swerve ,</l>
     <l n="2">While I triumph o'er a secret wrung from nature 's close reserve ,</l>
     <l n="3">In you come with your cold music till I creep through every nerve .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Yes , you , like a ghostly cricket , creaking where a house was burned : “ Dust and ashes , dead and done with , Venice spent what Venice 35 earned . The soul , doubtless , is immortal — where a soul can be discerned .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ Yours for instance ; you know physics , something of geology ,</l>
     <l n="2">Mathematics are your pastime ; souls shall rise in their degree ;</l>
     <l n="3">Butterflies may dread extinction — you 'll not die , it cannot be !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="4">“ As for Venice and her people , merely born to bloom and drop , 40</l>
     <l n="5">Here on earth they bore their fruitage , mirth and folly were the crop ;</l>
     <l n="6">What of soul was left , I wonder , when the kissing had to stop ?</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>“ Dust and ashes ! ” So you creak it , and I want the heart to scold . Dear dead women , with such hair , too — what 's become of all the gold Used to hang and brush their bosoms ? I feel chilly and grown 45 old .</p>

     <l n="3">That piece a wonder , now : Frà Pandolf 's hands</l>
     <l n="4">Worked busily a day , and there she stands .</l>
     <l n="5">Will't please you sit and look at her ? I said 5</l>
     <l n="6">“ Frà Pandolf ” by design , for never read</l>
     <l n="7">Strangers like you that pictured countenance ,</l>
     <l n="8">The depth and passion of its earnest glance ,</l>
     <l n="9">But to myself they turned ( since none puts by</l>
     <l n="10">The curtain I have drawn for you , but I ) 10</l>
     <l n="11">And seemed as they would ask me , if they durst ,</l>
     <l n="12">How such a glance came there ; so , not the first</l>
     <l n="13">Are you to turn and ask thus . Sir , ‘ twas not</l>
     <l n="14">Her husband 's presence only , called that spot</l>
     <l n="15">Of joy into the Duchess ’ cheek ; perhaps 15</l>
     <l n="16">Frà Pandolf chanced to say , “ Her mantle laps</l>
     <l n="17">Over my lady 's wrist too much , ” or “ Paint</l>
     <l n="18">Must never hope to reproduce the faint</l>
     <l n="19">Half-flush that dies along her throat ” ; such stuff</l>
     <l n="20">Was courtesy , she thought , and cause enough 20</l>
     <l n="21">For calling up that spot of joy . She had</l>
     <l n="22">A heart — how shall I say ?— too soon made glad ,</l>
     <l n="23">Too easily impressed ; she liked whate'er</l>
     <l n="24">She looked on , and her looks went everywhere .</l>

     <l n="27">The bough of cherries some officious fool</l>
     <l n="28">Broke in the orchard for her , the white mule</l>
     <l n="29">She rode with round the terrace — all and each</l>
     <l n="30">Would draw from her alike the approving speech , 30</l>
     <l n="31">Or blush , at least . She thanked men — good ! but thanked</l>
     <l n="32">Somehow — I know not how — as if she ranked</l>

     <l n="36">In speech — ( which I have not ) — to make your will</l>
     <l n="37">Quite clear to such an one , and say , “ Just this</l>
     <l n="38">Or that in you disgusts me ; here you miss ,</l>
     <l n="39">Or there exceed the mark ” — and if she let</l>
     <l n="40">Herself be lessoned so , nor plainly set 40</l>
     <l n="41">Her wits to yours , forsooth , and made excuse ,</l>
     <l n="42">— E'en then would be some stooping ; and I choose</l>
     <l n="43">Never to stoop . Oh , sir , she smiled , no doubt ,</l>
     <l n="44">Whene'er I passed her ; but who passed without</l>
     <l n="45">Much the same smile ? This grew ; I gave commands ; 45</l>

      <l n="216">As the Piper turned from the High Street</l>
      <l n="217">To where the Weser rolled its waters</l>
      <l n="218">Right in the way of their sons and daughters !</l>
      <l n="219">However he turned from South to West ,</l>
      <l n="220">And to Koppelberg Hill his steps addressed , 220</l>
      <l n="221">And after him the children pressed ;</l>
      <l n="222">Great was the joy in every breast .</l>

      <l n="224">He 's forced to let the piping drop ,</l>
      <l n="225">And we shall see our children stop ! ” 225</l>
      <l n="226">When , lo , as they reached the mountain-side ,</l>
      <l n="227">A wondrous portal opened wide ,</l>
      <l n="228">As if a cavern was suddenly hollowed ;</l>
      <l n="229">And the Piper advanced and the children followed ,</l>
      <l n="230">And when all were in to the very last , 230</l>
      <l n="231">The door in the mountain-side shut fast .</l>
      <l n="232">Did I say , all ? No ! One was lame ,</l>
      <l n="233">And could not dance the whole of the way ;</l>
      <l n="234">And in after years , if you would blame</l>
      <l n="235">His sadness , he was used to say — 235</l>
      <l n="236">“ It 's dull in our town since my playmates left !</l>
      <l n="237">I can n't forget that I 'm bereft</l>
      <l n="238">Of all the pleasant sights they see ,</l>
      <l n="239">Which the Piper also promised me .</l>
      <l n="240">For he led us , he said , to a joyous land , 240</l>
      <l n="241">Joining the town and just at hand ,</l>
      <l n="242">Where waters gushed and fruit-trees grew</l>
      <l n="243">And flowers put forth a fairer hue ,</l>
      <l n="244">And everything was strange and new ;</l>
      <l n="245">The sparrows were brighter than peacocks here , 245</l>
      <l n="246">And their dogs outran our fallow deer ,</l>
      <l n="247">And honey-bees had lost their stings ,</l>
      <l n="248">And horses were born with eagles ’ wings :</l>
      <l n="249">And just as I became assured</l>
      <l n="250">My lame foot would be speedily cured , 250</l>
      <l n="251">The music stopped and I stood still ,</l>
      <l n="252">And found myself outside the hill ,</l>
      <l n="253">Left alone against my will ,</l>
      <l n="254">To go now limping as before ,</l>

      <l n="182">And she that could do it , great or small ,</l>
      <l n="183">She was to do nothing at all .</l>
      <l n="184">There was already this man in his post ,</l>
      <l n="185">This in his station , and that in his office , 185</l>
      <l n="186">And the Duke 's plan admitted a wife , at most ,</l>
      <l n="187">To meet his eye , with the other trophies ,</l>
      <l n="188">Now outside the hall , now in it ,</l>
      <l n="189">To sit thus , stand thus , see and be seen ,</l>
      <l n="190">At the proper place in the proper minute , 190</l>
      <l n="191">And die away the life between .</l>
      <l n="192">And it was amusing enough , each infraction</l>
      <l n="193">Of rule — ( but for after-sadness that came )</l>
      <l n="194">To hear the consummate self-satisfaction</l>
      <l n="195">With which the young Duke and the old dame 195</l>
      <l n="196">Would let her advise , and criticize ,</l>
      <l n="197">And , being a fool , instruct the wise ,</l>
      <l n="198">And , child-like , parcel out praise or blame :</l>
      <l n="199">They bore it all in complacent guise ,</l>
      <l n="200">As though an artificer , after contriving 200</l>
      <l n="201">A wheel-work image as if it were living ,</l>
      <l n="202">Should find with delight it could motion to strike him !</l>
      <l n="203">So found the Duke , and his mother like him :</l>
      <l n="204">The lady hardly got a rebuff —</l>
      <l n="205">That had not been contemptuous enough , 205</l>
      <l n="206">With his cursed smirk , as he nodded applause ,</l>
      <l n="207">And kept off the old mother-cat 's claws .</l>

      <l n="216">Well , early in autumn , at first winter-warning ,</l>
      <l n="217">When the stag had to break with his foot , of a morning ,</l>
      <l n="218">A drinking-hole out of the fresh tender ice</l>

      <l n="224">Asked himself what were the pleasures in season ,</l>
      <l n="225">And found , since the calendar bade him be hearty , 225</l>

      <l n="252">Now you must know that when the first dizziness</l>
      <l n="253">Of flap-hats and buff-coats and jack-boots subsided ,</l>
      <l n="254">The Duke put this question , “ The Duke 's part provided ,</l>
      <l n="255">Had not the Duchess some share in the business ? ” 255</l>
      <l n="256">For out of the mouth of two or three witnesses</l>
      <l n="257">Did he establish all fit-or-unfitnesses :</l>
      <l n="258">And , after much laying of heads together ,</l>

      <l n="263">“ When horns wind a mort and the deer is at siege ,</l>
      <l n="264">Let the dame of the castle prick forth on her jennet ,</l>
      <l n="265">And , with water to wash the hands of her liege 265</l>
      <l n="266">In a clean ewer with a fair toweling ,</l>
      <l n="267">Let her preside at the disemboweling . ”</l>
      <l n="268">Now , my friend , if you had so little religion</l>
      <l n="269">As to catch a hawk , some falcon-lanner ,</l>
      <l n="270">And thrust her broad wings like a banner 270</l>
      <l n="271">Into a coop for a vulgar pigeon ;</l>
      <l n="272">And if day by day and week by week</l>
      <l n="273">You cut her claws , and sealed her eyes ,</l>
      <l n="274">And clipped her wings , and tied her beak ,</l>
      <l n="275">Would it cause you any great surprise 275</l>
      <l n="276">If , when you decided to give her an airing ,</l>
      <l n="277">You found she needed a little preparing ?</l>
      <l n="278">— I say , should you be such a curmudgeon ,</l>
      <l n="279">If she clung to the perch , as to take it in dudgeon ?</l>
      <l n="280">Yet when the Duke to his lady signified , 280</l>
      <l n="281">Just a day before , as he judged most dignified ,</l>
      <l n="282">In what a pleasure she was to participate —</l>
      <l n="283">And , instead of leaping wide in flashes ,</l>
      <l n="284">Her eyes just lifted their long lashes ,</l>
      <l n="285">As if pressed by fatigue even he could not dissipate , 285</l>
      <l n="286">And duly acknowledged the Duke 's forethought ,</l>
      <l n="287">But spoke of her health , if her health were worth aught ,</l>
      <l n="288">Of the weight by day and the watch by night ,</l>
      <l n="289">And much wrong now that used to be right ,</l>
      <l n="290">So , thanking him , declined the hunting — 290</l>
      <l n="291">Was conduct ever more affronting ?</l>
      <l n="292">With all the ceremony settled —</l>
      <l n="293">With the towel ready , and the sewer</l>
      <l n="294">Polishing up his oldest ewer ,</l>
      <l n="295">And the jennet pitched upon , a piebald , 295</l>
      <l n="296">Black-barred , cream-coated , and pink eye-balled —</l>
      <l n="297">No wonder if the Duke was nettled !</l>
      <l n="298">And when she persisted nevertheless —</l>
      <l n="299">Well , I suppose here 's the time to confess</l>
      <l n="300">That there ran half round our lady 's chamber 300</l>
      <l n="301">A balcony none of the hardest to clamber ;</l>
      <l n="302">And that Jacynth , the tire-woman , ready in waiting ,</l>
      <l n="303">Stayed in call outside , what need of relating ?</l>
      <l n="304">And since Jacynth was like a June rose , why , a fervent</l>
      <l n="305">Adorer of Jacynth of course was your servant ; 305</l>
      <l n="306">And if she had the habit to peep through the casement ,</l>
      <l n="307">How could I keep at any vast distance ?</l>
      <l n="308">And so , as I say , on the lady 's persistence ,</l>
      <l n="309">The Duke , dumb-stricken with amazement ,</l>
      <l n="310">Stood for a while in a sultry smother , 310</l>
      <l n="311">And then , with a smile that partook of the awful ,</l>
      <l n="312">Turned her over to his yellow mother</l>
      <l n="313">To learn what was held decorous and lawful ;</l>
      <l n="314">And the mother smelt blood with a cat-like instinct ,</l>
      <l n="315">As her cheek quick whitened through all its quince-tinct . 315</l>
      <l n="316">Oh , but the lady heard the whole truth at once !</l>
      <l n="317">What meant she ?— Who was she ?— Her duty and station ,</l>
      <l n="318">The wisdom of age and the folly of youth , at once ,</l>
      <l n="319">Its decent regard and its fitting relation —</l>
      <l n="320">In brief , my friend , set all the devils in hell free 320</l>
      <l n="321">And turn them out to carouse in a belfry</l>
      <l n="322">And treat the priests to a fifty-part canon ,</l>
      <l n="323">And then you may guess how that tongue of hers ran on !</l>
      <l n="324">Well , somehow or other it ended at last</l>
      <l n="325">And , licking her whiskers , out she passed ; 325</l>
      <l n="326">And after her — making ( he hoped ) a face</l>
      <l n="327">Like Emperor Nero or Sultan Saladin ,</l>
      <l n="328">Stalked the Duke 's self with the austere grace</l>
      <l n="329">Of ancient hero or modern paladin ,</l>
      <l n="330">From door to staircase — oh , such a solemn 330</l>

      <l n="352">North they go , South they go , trooping or lonely ,</l>

      <l n="354">Catch they and keep now a trace here , a trace there ,</l>
      <l n="355">That puts you in mind of a place here , a place there 355</l>
      <l n="356">But with us , I believe they rise out of the ground ,</l>
      <l n="357">And nowhere else , I take it , are found</l>
      <l n="358">With the earth-tint yet so freshly embrowned :</l>
      <l n="359">Born , no doubt , like insects which breed on</l>
      <l n="360">The very fruit they are meant to feed on . 360</l>
      <l n="361">For the earth — not a use to which they do n't turn it ,</l>

      <l n="363">Or the sand in the pits like a honeycomb ,</l>
      <l n="364">They sift and soften it , bake it and burn it —</l>
      <l n="365">Whether they weld you , for instance , a snaffle 365</l>
      <l n="366">With side-bars never a brute can baffle ;</l>
      <l n="367">Or a lock that 's a puzzle of wards within wards ;</l>
      <l n="368">Or , if your colt 's forefoot inclines to curve inwards ,</l>
      <l n="369">Horseshoes they hammer which turn on a swivel</l>
      <l n="370">And wo n't allow the hoof to shrivel . 370</l>
      <l n="371">Then they cast bells like the shell of the winkle</l>
      <l n="372">That keep a stout heart in the ram with their tinkle ;</l>
      <l n="373">But the sand — they pinch and pound it like otters ;</l>
      <l n="374">Commend me the gypsy glass-makers and potters !</l>
      <l n="375">Glasses they 'll blow you , crystal-clear , 375</l>
      <l n="376">Where just a faint cloud of rose shall appear ,</l>
      <l n="377">As if in pure water you dropped and let die</l>
      <l n="378">A bruised black-blooded mulberry ;</l>
      <l n="379">And that other sort , their crowning pride ,</l>
      <l n="380">With long white threads distinct inside , 380</l>
      <l n="381">Like the lake-flower 's fibrous roots which dangle</l>
      <l n="382">Loose such a length and never tangle ,</l>
      <l n="383">Where the bold sword-lily cuts the clear waters ,</l>
      <l n="384">And the cup-lily couches with all the white daughters :</l>
      <l n="385">Such are the works they put their hand to , 385</l>
      <l n="386">The uses they turn and twist iron and sand to .</l>
      <l n="387">And these made the troop , which our Duke saw sally</l>
      <l n="388">Toward his castle from out of the valley ,</l>
      <l n="389">Men and women , like new-hatched spiders ,</l>
      <l n="390">Come out with the morning to greet our riders . 390</l>
      <l n="391">And up they wound till they reached the ditch ,</l>
      <l n="392">Whereat all stopped save one , a witch</l>
      <l n="393">That I knew , as she hobbled from the group ,</l>
      <l n="394">By her gait directly and her stoop ,</l>
      <l n="395">I , whom Jacynth was used to importune 395</l>
      <l n="396">To let that same witch tell us our fortune .</l>
      <l n="397">The oldest gypsy then above ground ;</l>
      <l n="398">And , sure as the autumn season came round ,</l>
      <l n="399">She paid us a visit for profit or pastime ,</l>
      <l n="400">And every time , as she swore , for the last time . 400</l>
      <l n="401">And presently she was seen to sidle</l>
      <l n="402">Up to the Duke till she touched his bridle ,</l>
      <l n="403">So that the horse of a sudden reared up</l>
      <l n="404">As under its nose the old witch peered up</l>
      <l n="405">With her worn-out eyes , or rather eye-holes 405</l>
      <l n="406">Of no use now but to gather brine ,</l>
      <l n="407">And began a kind of level whine</l>
      <l n="408">Such as they used to sing to their viols</l>
      <l n="409">When their ditties they go grinding</l>
      <l n="410">Up and down with nobody minding ; 410</l>
      <l n="411">And then , as of old , at the end of the humming</l>
      <l n="412">Her usual presents were forthcoming</l>
      <l n="413">— A dog-whistle blowing the fiercest of trebles</l>
      <l n="414">( Just a seashore stone holding a dozen fine pebbles ) ,</l>
      <l n="415">Or a porcelain mouthpiece to screw on a pipe-end — 415</l>
      <l n="416">And so she awaited her annual stipend .</l>
      <l n="417">But this time the Duke would scarcely vouchsafe</l>
      <l n="418">A word in reply ; and in vain she felt</l>
      <l n="419">With twitching fingers at her belt</l>
      <l n="420">For the purse of sleek pine-marten pelt , 420</l>
      <l n="421">Ready to put what he gave in her pouch safe —</l>
      <l n="422">Till , either to quicken his apprehension ,</l>
      <l n="423">Or possibly with an after-intention ,</l>
      <l n="424">She was come , she said , to pay her duty</l>
      <l n="425">To the new Duchess , the youthful beauty . 425</l>
      <l n="426">No sooner had she named his lady</l>
      <l n="427">Than a shine lit up the face so shady ,</l>
      <l n="428">And its smirk returned with a novel meaning —</l>
      <l n="429">For it struck him , the babe just wanted weaning ;</l>
      <l n="430">If one gave her a taste of what life was and sorrow , 430</l>
      <l n="431">She , foolish today , would be wiser tomorrow ;</l>
      <l n="432">And who so fit a teacher of trouble</l>
      <l n="433">As this sordid crone bent well-nigh double ?</l>
      <l n="434">So , glancing at her wolf-skin vesture ,</l>
      <l n="435">( If such it was , for they grow so hirsute 435</l>
      <l n="436">That their own fleece serves for natural fur-suit )</l>
      <l n="437">He was contrasting , ‘ twas plain from his gesture ,</l>
      <l n="438">The life of the lady so flower-like and delicate</l>
      <l n="439">With the loathsome squalor of this helicat .</l>
      <l n="440">I , in brief , was the man the Duke beckoned 440</l>
      <l n="441">From out of the throng , and while I drew near</l>
      <l n="442">He told the crone — as I since have reckoned</l>
      <l n="443">By the way he bent and spoke into her ear</l>
      <l n="444">With circumspection and mystery —</l>
      <l n="445">The main of the lady 's history , 445</l>
      <l n="446">Her frowardness and ingratitude :</l>
      <l n="447">And for all the crone 's submissive attitude</l>
      <l n="448">I could see round her mouth the loose plaits tightening ,</l>
      <l n="449">And her brow with assenting intelligence brightening ,</l>
      <l n="450">As though she engaged with hearty goodwill 450</l>
      <l n="451">Whatever he now might enjoin to fulfill ,</l>
      <l n="452">And promised the lady a thorough frightening .</l>
      <l n="453">And so , just giving her a glimpse</l>
      <l n="454">Of a purse , with the air of a man who imps</l>
      <l n="455">The wing of the hawk that shall fetch the hernshaw , 455</l>
      <l n="456">He bade me take the gypsy mother</l>
      <l n="457">And set her telling some story or other</l>
      <l n="458">Of hill or dale , oak-wood or fernshaw ,</l>
      <l n="459">To wile away a weary hour</l>
      <l n="460">For the lady left alone in her bower , 460</l>
      <l n="461">Whose mind and body craved exertion</l>
      <l n="462">And yet shrank from all better diversion .</l>

      <l n="463">Then clapping heel to his horse , the mere curveter ,</l>
      <l n="464">Out rode the Duke , and after his hollo</l>
      <l n="465">Horses and hounds swept , huntsman and servitor , 465</l>
      <l n="466">And back I turned and bade the crone follow .</l>
      <l n="467">And what makes me confident what 's to be told you</l>
      <l n="468">Had all along been of this crone 's devising ,</l>
      <l n="469">Is , that , on looking round sharply , behold you ,</l>
      <l n="470">There was a novelty quick as surprising : 470</l>
      <l n="471">For first , she had shot up a full head in stature ,</l>
      <l n="472">And her step kept pace with mine nor faltered ,</l>
      <l n="473">As if age had foregone its usurpature ,</l>
      <l n="474">And the ignoble mien was wholly altered ,</l>
      <l n="475">And the face looked quite of another nature , 475</l>
      <l n="476">And the change reached too , whatever the change meant ,</l>
      <l n="477">Her shaggy wolf-skin cloak 's arrangement :</l>
      <l n="478">For where its tatters hung loose like sedges ,</l>
      <l n="479">Gold coins were glittering on the edges ,</l>
      <l n="480">Like the band-roll strung with tomans 480</l>
      <l n="481">Which proves the veil a Persian woman 's :</l>
      <l n="482">And under her brow , like a snail 's horns newly</l>
      <l n="483">Come out as after the rain he paces ,</l>
      <l n="484">Two unmistakable eye-points duly</l>
      <l n="485">Live and aware looked out of their places . 485</l>
      <l n="486">So , we went and found Jacynth at the entry</l>
      <l n="487">Of the lady 's chamber standing sentry ;</l>
      <l n="488">I told the command and produced my companion ,</l>
      <l n="489">And Jacynth rejoiced to admit anyone ,</l>
      <l n="490">For since last night , by the same token , 490</l>
      <l n="491">Not a single word had the lady spoken :</l>
      <l n="492">They went in both to the presence together ,</l>
      <l n="493">While I in the balcony watched the weather .</l>

      <l n="494">And now , what took place at the very first of all ,</l>
      <l n="495">I cannot tell , as I never could learn it : 495</l>
      <l n="496">Jacynth constantly wished a curse to fall</l>
      <l n="497">On that little head of hers and burn it ,</l>
      <l n="498">If she knew how she came to drop so soundly</l>
      <l n="499">Asleep of a sudden and there continue</l>
      <l n="500">The whole time sleeping as profoundly 500</l>
      <l n="501">As one of the boars my father would pin you</l>
      <l n="502">‘ Twixt the eyes where life holds garrison ,</l>
      <l n="503">— Jacynth forgive me the comparison !</l>
      <l n="504">But where I begin my own narration</l>
      <l n="505">Is a little after I took my station 505</l>
      <l n="506">To breathe the fresh air from the balcony ,</l>
      <l n="507">And , having in those days a falcon eye ,</l>
      <l n="508">To follow the hunt through the open country ,</l>
      <l n="509">From where the bushes thinlier crested</l>
      <l n="510">The hillocks , to a plain where 's not one tree . 510</l>
      <l n="511">When , in a moment , my ear was arrested</l>
      <l n="512">By — was it singing , or was it saying ,</l>
      <l n="513">Or a strange musical instrument playing</l>
      <l n="514">In the chamber ?— and to be certain</l>
      <l n="515">I pushed the lattice , pulled the curtain , 515</l>
      <l n="516">And there lay Jacynth asleep ,</l>
      <l n="517">Yet as if a watch she tried to keep ,</l>
      <l n="518">In a rosy sleep along the floor</l>
      <l n="519">With her head against the door ;</l>
      <l n="520">While in the midst , on the seat of state , 520</l>
      <l n="521">Was a queen — the gypsy woman late ,</l>
      <l n="522">With head and face downbent</l>
      <l n="523">On the lady 's head and face intent :</l>
      <l n="524">For , coiled at her feet like a child at ease ,</l>
      <l n="525">The lady sat between her knees , 525</l>
      <l n="526">And o'er them the lady 's clasped hands met ,</l>
      <l n="527">And on those hands her chin was set ,</l>
      <l n="528">And her upturned face met the face of the crone</l>
      <l n="529">Wherein the eyes had grown and grown</l>
      <l n="530">As if she could double and quadruple 530</l>
      <l n="531">At pleasure the play of either pupil</l>
      <l n="532">— Very like , by her hands ’ slow fanning ,</l>
      <l n="533">As up and down like a gor-crow 's flappers</l>
      <l n="534">They moved to measure , or bell-clappers .</l>
      <l n="535">I said , “ Is it blessing , is it banning , 535</l>
      <l n="536">Do they applaud you or burlesque you</l>
      <l n="537">Those hands and fingers with no flesh on ? ”</l>
      <l n="538">But , just as I thought to spring in to the rescue ,</l>
      <l n="539">At once I was stopped by the lady 's expression :</l>
      <l n="540">For it was life her eyes were drinking 540</l>
      <l n="541">From the crone 's wide pair above unwinking ,</l>
      <l n="542">— Life 's pure fire received without shrinking ,</l>
      <l n="543">Into the heart and breast whose heaving</l>
      <l n="544">Told you no single drop they were leaving</l>
      <l n="545">— Life , that filling her , passed redundant 545</l>
      <l n="546">Into her very hair , back swerving</l>
      <l n="547">Over each shoulder , loose and abundant ,</l>
      <l n="548">As her head thrown back showed the white throat curving ;</l>
      <l n="549">And the very tresses shared in the pleasure ,</l>
      <l n="550">Moving to the mystic measure , 550</l>
      <l n="551">Bounding as the bosom bounded .</l>
      <l n="552">I stopped short , more and more confounded ,</l>
      <l n="553">As still her cheeks burned and eyes glistened ,</l>
      <l n="554">As she listened and she listened :</l>
      <l n="555">When all at once a hand detained me , 555</l>
      <l n="556">The selfsame contagion gained me ,</l>
      <l n="557">And I kept time to the wondrous chime ,</l>
      <l n="558">Making out words and prose and rhyme ,</l>
      <l n="559">Till it seemed that the music furled</l>
      <l n="560">Its wings like a task fulfilled , and dropped 560</l>
      <l n="561">From under the words it first had propped ,</l>
      <l n="562">And left them midway in the world :</l>
      <l n="563">Word took word as hand takes hand ,</l>
      <l n="564">I could hear at last , and understand ,</l>
      <l n="565">And when I held the unbroken thread , 565</l>
      <l n="566">The gypsy said :</l>
      <l n="567">“ And so at last we find my tribe .</l>
      <l n="568">And so I set thee in the midst ,</l>
      <l n="569">And to one and all of them describe</l>
      <l n="570">What thou saidst and what thou didst , 570</l>
      <l n="571">Our long and terrible journey through ,</l>
      <l n="572">And all thou art ready to say and do</l>
      <l n="573">In the trials that remain :</l>
      <l n="574">I trace them the vein and the other vein</l>
      <l n="575">That meet on thy brow and part again , 575</l>
      <l n="576">Making our rapid mystic mark ;</l>
      <l n="577">And I bid my people prove and probe</l>
      <l n="578">Each eye 's profound and glorious globe</l>
      <l n="579">Till they detect the kindred spark</l>
      <l n="580">In those depths so dear and dark , 580</l>
      <l n="581">Like the spots that snap and burst and flee ,</l>
      <l n="582">Circling over the midnight sea .</l>
      <l n="583">And on that round young cheek of thine</l>
      <l n="584">I make them recognize the tinge ,</l>
      <l n="585">As when of the costly scarlet wine 585</l>
      <l n="586">They drip so much as will impinge</l>
      <l n="587">And spread in a thinnest scale afloat</l>
      <l n="588">One thick gold drop from the olive 's coat</l>
      <l n="589">Over a silver plate whose sheen</l>
      <l n="590">Still through the mixture shall be seen . 590</l>
      <l n="591">For so I prove thee , to one and all ,</l>
      <l n="592">Fit , when my people ope their breast ,</l>
      <l n="593">To see the sign , and hear the call ,</l>
      <l n="594">And take the vow , and stand the test</l>
      <l n="595">Which adds one more child to the rest — 595</l>
      <l n="596">When the breast is bare and the arms are wide ,</l>
      <l n="597">And the world is left outside .</l>
      <l n="598">For there is probation to decree ,</l>
      <l n="599">And many and long must the trials be</l>
      <l n="600">Thou shalt victoriously endure , 600</l>
      <l n="601">If that brow is true and those eyes are sure ;</l>
      <l n="602">Like a jewel-finder 's fierce assay</l>
      <l n="603">Of the prize he dug from its mountain-tomb —</l>
      <l n="604">Let once the vindicating ray</l>
      <l n="605">Leap out amid the anxious gloom , 605</l>
      <l n="606">And steel and fire have done their part</l>
      <l n="607">And the prize falls on its finder 's heart ;</l>
      <l n="608">So , trial after trial past ,</l>
      <l n="609">Wilt thou fall at the very last</l>
      <l n="610">Breathless , half in trance 610</l>
      <l n="611">With the thrill of the great deliverance ,</l>
      <l n="612">Into our arms forevermore ;</l>
      <l n="613">And thou shalt know , those arms once curled</l>
      <l n="614">About thee , what we knew before ,</l>
      <l n="615">How love is the only good in the world . 615</l>
      <l n="616">Henceforth be loved as heart can love ,</l>
      <l n="617">Or brain devise , or hand approve !</l>
      <l n="618">Stand up , look below ,</l>
      <l n="619">It is our life at thy feet we throw</l>
      <l n="620">To step with into light and joy ; 620</l>
      <l n="621">Not a power of life but we employ</l>
      <l n="622">To satisfy thy nature 's want ;</l>
      <l n="623">Art thou the tree that props the plant ,</l>
      <l n="624">Or the climbing plant that seeks the tree —</l>
      <l n="625">Canst thou help us , must we help thee ? 625</l>
      <l n="626">If any two creatures grew into one ,</l>
      <l n="627">They would do more than the world has done :</l>
      <l n="628">Though each apart were never so weak ,</l>
      <l n="629">Ye vainly through the world should seek</l>
      <l n="630">For the knowledge and the might 630</l>
      <l n="631">Which in such union grew their right :</l>
      <l n="632">So , to approach at least that end ,</l>
      <l n="633">And blend — as much as may be , blend</l>
      <l n="634">Thee with us or us with thee —</l>
      <l n="635">As climbing plant or propping tree , 635</l>
      <l n="636">Shall someone deck thee , over and down ,</l>
      <l n="637">Up and about , with blossoms and leaves ?</l>
      <l n="638">Fix his heart 's fruit for thy garland-crown ,</l>
      <l n="639">Cling with his soul as the gourd-vine cleaves ,</l>
      <l n="640">Die on thy boughs and disappear 640</l>
      <l n="641">While not a leaf of thine is sere ?</l>
      <l n="642">Or is the other fate in store ,</l>
      <l n="643">And art thou fitted to adore ,</l>
      <l n="644">To give thy wondrous self away ,</l>
      <l n="645">And take a stronger nature 's sway ? 645</l>
      <l n="646">I foresee and could foretell</l>
      <l n="647">Thy future portion , sure and well :</l>
      <l n="648">But those passionate eyes speak true , speak true ,</l>
      <l n="649">Let them say what thou shalt do !</l>
      <l n="650">Only be sure thy daily life , 650</l>
      <l n="651">In its peace or in its strife ,</l>
      <l n="652">Never shall be unobserved ;</l>
      <l n="653">We pursue thy whole career ,</l>
      <l n="654">And hope for it , or doubt , or fear —</l>
      <l n="655">Lo , hast thou kept thy path or swerved , 655</l>
      <l n="656">We are beside thee in all thy ways ,</l>
      <l n="657">With our blame , with our praise ,</l>
      <l n="658">Our shame to feel , our pride to show ,</l>
      <l n="659">Glad , angry — but indifferent , no !</l>
      <l n="660">Whether it be thy lot to go , 660</l>
      <l n="661">For the good of us all , where the haters meet</l>
      <l n="662">In the crowded city 's horrible street ;</l>
      <l n="663">Or thou step alone through the morass</l>
      <l n="664">Where never sound yet was</l>
      <l n="665">Save the dry quick clap of the stork 's bill , 665</l>
      <l n="666">For the air is still , and the water still ,</l>
      <l n="667">When the blue breast of the dipping coot</l>
      <l n="668">Dives under , and all is mute .</l>
      <l n="669">So , at the last shall come old age ,</l>
      <l n="670">Decrepit as befits that stage ; 670</l>
      <l n="671">How else wouldst thou retire apart</l>
      <l n="672">With the hoarded memories of thy heart ,</l>
      <l n="673">And gather all to the very least</l>
      <l n="674">Of the fragments of life 's earlier feast ,</l>
      <l n="675">Let fall through eagerness to find 675</l>
      <l n="676">The crowning dainties yet behind ?</l>
      <l n="677">Ponder on the entire past</l>
      <l n="678">Laid together thus at last ,</l>
      <l n="679">When the twilight helps to fuse</l>
      <l n="680">The first fresh with the faded hues , 680</l>
      <l n="681">And the outline of the whole ,</l>
      <l n="682">As round eve 's shades their framework roll ,</l>
      <l n="683">Grandly fronts for once thy soul .</l>
      <l n="684">And then as , ‘ mid the dark , a gleam</l>
      <l n="685">Of yet another morning breaks , 685</l>
      <l n="686">And like the hand which ends a dream ,</l>
      <l n="687">Death , with the might of his sunbeam ,</l>
      <l n="688">Touches the flesh and the soul awakes ,</l>
      <l n="689">Then ” ——</l>
      <l n="690">Aye , then indeed something would happen !</l>
      <l n="691">But what ? For here her voice changed like a bird 's ; 690</l>
      <l n="692">There grew more of the music and less of the words ;</l>
      <l n="693">Had Jacynth only been by me to clap pen</l>
      <l n="694">To paper and put you down every syllable</l>
      <l n="695">With those clever clerkly fingers ,</l>
      <l n="696">All I 've forgotten as well as what lingers 695</l>
      <l n="697">In this old brain of mine that 's but ill able</l>
      <l n="698">To give you even this poor version</l>
      <l n="699">Of the speech I spoil , as it were , with stammering</l>
      <l n="700">— More fault of those who had the hammering</l>
      <l n="701">Of prosody into me and syntax , 700</l>
      <l n="702">And did it , not with hobnails but tin-tacks !</l>
      <l n="703">But to return from this excursion —</l>
      <l n="704">Just , do you mark , when the song was sweetest ,</l>
      <l n="705">The peace most deep and the charm completest ,</l>
      <l n="706">There came , shall I say , a snap — 705</l>
      <l n="707">And the charm vanished !</l>
      <l n="708">And my sense returned , so strangely banished ,</l>
      <l n="709">And , starting as from a nap ,</l>
      <l n="710">I knew the crone was bewitching my lady ,</l>
      <l n="711">With Jacynth asleep ; and but one spring made I 710</l>
      <l n="712">Down from the casement , round to the portal ,</l>
      <l n="713">Another minute and I had entered —</l>
      <l n="714">When the door opened , and more than mortal</l>
      <l n="715">Stood , with a face where to my mind centered</l>
      <l n="716">All beauties I ever saw or shall see , 715</l>
      <l n="717">The Duchess : I stopped as if struck by palsy .</l>
      <l n="718">She was so different , happy and beautiful ,</l>
      <l n="719">I felt at once that all was best ,</l>
      <l n="720">And that I had nothing to do , for the rest ,</l>
      <l n="721">But wait her commands , obey and be dutiful . 720</l>
      <l n="722">Not that , in fact , there was any commanding ;</l>
      <l n="723">I saw the glory of her eye ,</l>
      <l n="724">And the brow 's height and the breast 's expanding ,</l>
      <l n="725">And I was hers to live or to die .</l>
      <l n="726">As for finding what she wanted , 725</l>
      <l n="727">You know God Almighty granted</l>
      <l n="728">Such little signs should serve wild creatures</l>
      <l n="729">To tell one another all their desires ,</l>
      <l n="730">So that each knows what his friend requires ,</l>
      <l n="731">And does its bidding without teachers . 730</l>
      <l n="732">I preceded her : the crone</l>
      <l n="733">Followed silent and alone ;</l>
      <l n="734">I spoke to her , but she merely jabbered</l>
      <l n="735">In the old style ; both her eyes had slunk</l>
      <l n="736">Back to their pits ; her stature shrunk ; 735</l>
      <l n="737">In short , the soul in its body sunk</l>
      <l n="738">Like a blade sent home to its scabbard .</l>
      <l n="739">We descended , I preceding ;</l>
      <l n="740">Crossed the court with nobody heeding ;</l>
      <l n="741">All the world was at the chase , 740</l>
      <l n="742">The courtyard like a desert-place ,</l>
      <l n="743">The stable emptied of its small fry ;</l>
      <l n="744">I saddled myself the very palfrey</l>
      <l n="745">I remember patting while it carried her ,</l>
      <l n="746">The day she arrived and the Duke married her . 745</l>
      <l n="747">And , do you know , though it 's easy deceiving</l>
      <l n="748">Oneself in such matters , I can n't help believing</l>
      <l n="749">The lady had not forgotten it either ,</l>
      <l n="750">And knew the poor devil so much beneath her</l>
      <l n="751">Would have been only too glad for her service 750</l>
      <l n="752">To dance on hot plowshares like a Turk dervise ,</l>
      <l n="753">But , unable to pay proper duty where owing it ,</l>
      <l n="754">Was reduced to that pitiful method of showing it :</l>
      <l n="755">For though the moment I began setting</l>
      <l n="756">His saddle on my own nag of Berold 's begetting , 755</l>
      <l n="757">( Not that I meant to be obtrusive )</l>
      <l n="758">She stopped me , while his rug was shifting ,</l>
      <l n="759">By a single rapid finger 's lifting ,</l>
      <l n="760">And , with a gesture kind but conclusive ,</l>
      <l n="761">And a little shake of the head , refused me — 760</l>
      <l n="762">I say , although she never used me ,</l>
      <l n="763">Yet when she was mounted , the gypsy behind her ,</l>
      <l n="764">And I ventured to remind her ,</l>
      <l n="765">I suppose with a voice of less steadiness</l>
      <l n="766">Than usual , for my feeling exceeded me , 765</l>
      <l n="767">— Something to the effect that I was in readiness</l>
      <l n="768">Whenever God should please she needed me —</l>
      <l n="769">Then , do you know , her face looked down on me</l>
      <l n="770">With a look that placed a crown on me ,</l>
      <l n="771">And she felt in her bosom — mark , her bosom — 770</l>
      <l n="772">And , as a flower-tree drops its blossom ,</l>
      <l n="773">Dropped me ... ah , had it been a purse</l>
      <l n="774">Of silver , my friend , or gold that 's worse ,</l>
      <l n="775">Why , you see , as soon as I found myself</l>
      <l n="776">So understood — that a true heart so may gain 775</l>
      <l n="777">Such a reward — I should have gone home again ,</l>
      <l n="778">Kissed Jacynth , and soberly drowned myself !</l>
      <l n="779">It was a little plait of hair</l>
      <l n="780">Such as friends in a convent make</l>
      <l n="781">To wear , each for the other 's sake — 780</l>
      <l n="782">This , see , which at my breast I wear ,</l>
      <l n="783">Ever did ( rather to Jacynth 's grudgment ) ,</l>
      <l n="784">And ever shall , till the Day of Judgment .</l>
      <l n="785">And then — and then — to cut short — this is idle ,</l>
      <l n="786">These are feelings it is not good to foster — 785</l>
      <l n="787">I pushed the gate wide , she shook the bridle ,</l>
      <l n="788">And the palfrey bounded — and so we lost her .</l>

      <l n="813">That no one should touch on the story to wake it ,</l>
      <l n="814">For the wound in the Duke 's pride rankled fiery ,</l>
      <l n="815">So , they made no search and small inquiry —</l>
      <l n="816">And when fresh gypsies have paid us a visit , I 've 815</l>
      <l n="817">Noticed the couple were never inquisitive ,</l>

      <l n="842">Each supples a dry brain , fills you its ins-and-outs ,</l>

      <l n="848">For to me spoke the Duke , as I told you before ;</l>

      <l n="850">And now it is made — why , my heart 's blood , that went trickle ,</l>
      <l n="851">Trickle , but anon , in such muddy driblets , 850</l>
      <l n="852">Is pumped up brisk now , through the main ventricle .</l>
      <l n="853">And genially floats me about the giblets .</l>
      <l n="854">I 'll tell you what I intend to do :</l>
      <l n="855">I must see this fellow his sad life through —</l>
      <l n="856">He is our Duke , after all , 855</l>
      <l n="857">And I , as he says , but a serf and thrall .</l>
      <l n="858">My father was born here , and I inherit</l>
      <l n="859">His fame , a chain he bound his son with ;</l>
      <l n="860">Could I pay in a lump I should prefer it ,</l>
      <l n="861">But there 's no mine to blow up and get done with : 860</l>
      <l n="862">So , I must stay till the end of the chapter .</l>
      <l n="863">For , as to our middle-age-manners-adapter ,</l>
      <l n="864">Be it a thing to be glad on or sorry on ,</l>
      <l n="865">Some day or other , his head in a morion</l>
      <l n="866">And breast in a hauberk , his heels he 'll kick up , 865</l>
      <l n="867">Slain by an onslaught fierce of hiccup .</l>
      <l n="868">And then , when red doth the sword of our Duke rust ,</l>
      <l n="869">And its leathern sheath lie o'ergrown with a blue crust ,</l>
      <l n="870">Then I shall scrape together my earnings ;</l>
      <l n="871">For , you see , in the churchyard Jacynth reposes , 870</l>
      <l n="872">And our children all went the way of the roses .</l>
      <l n="873">It 's a long lane that knows no turnings .</l>
      <l n="874">One needs but little tackle to travel in ;</l>
      <l n="875">So , just one stout cloak shall I indue :</l>
      <l n="876">And for a staff , what beats the javelin 875</l>
      <l n="877">With which his boars my father pinned you ?</l>
      <l n="878">And then , for a purpose you shall hear presently ,</l>
      <l n="879">Taking some Cotnar , a tight plump skinful ,</l>
      <l n="880">I shall go journeying , who but I , pleasantly !</l>
      <l n="881">Sorrow is vain and despondency sinful . 880</l>
      <l n="882">What 's a man 's age ? He must hurry more , that 's all ;</l>
      <l n="883">Cram in a day what his youth took a year to hold :</l>
      <l n="884">When we mind labor , then only , we 're too old —</l>
      <l n="885">What age had Methusalem when he begat Saul ?</l>
      <l n="886">And at last , as its haven some buffeted ship sees , 885</l>
      <l n="887">( Come all the way from the north-parts with sperm oil )</l>
      <l n="888">I hope to get safely out of the turmoil</l>
      <l n="889">And arrive one day at the land of the gypsies ,</l>
      <l n="890">And find my lady , or hear the last news of her</l>
      <l n="891">From some old thief and son of Lucifer , 890</l>
      <l n="892">His forehead chapleted green with wreathy hop ,</l>
      <l n="893">Sunburned all over like an Æthiop .</l>
      <l n="894">And when my Cotnar begins to operate</l>
      <l n="895">And the tongue of the rogue to run at a proper rate ,</l>
      <l n="896">And our wine-skin , tight once , shows each flaccid dent , 895</l>
      <l n="897">I shall drop in with — as if by accident —</l>
      <l n="898">“ You never knew , then , how it all ended ,</l>
      <l n="899">What fortune good or bad attended</l>
      <l n="900">The little lady your Queen befriended ? ”</l>
      <l n="901">— And when that 's told me , what 's remaining ? 900</l>
      <l n="902">This world 's too hard for my explaining .</l>
      <l n="903">The same wise judge of matters equine</l>
      <l n="904">Who still preferred some slim four-year-old</l>
      <l n="905">To the big-boned stock of mighty Berold ,</l>
      <l n="906">And , for strong Cotnar , drank French weak wine , 905</l>
      <l n="907">He also must be such a lady 's scorner !</l>
      <l n="908">Smooth Jacob still robs homely Esau :</l>
      <l n="909">Now up , now down , the world 's one see-saw .</l>
      <l n="910">— So , I shall find out some snug corner</l>
      <l n="911">Under a hedge , like Orson the wood-knight , 910</l>
      <l n="912">Turn myself round and bid the world good night ;</l>
      <l n="913">And sleep a sound sleep till the trumpet 's blowing</l>
      <l n="914">Wakes me ( unless priests cheat us laymen )</l>
      <l n="915">To a world where will be no further throwing</l>
      <l n="916">Pearls before swine that can n't value them . Amen ! 915</l>

     <l n="8">The cloak , that somewhat shone and showed the threads ,</l>
     <l n="9">Had purpose , and the ruff , significance .</l>
     <l n="10">He walked and tapped the pavement with his cane , 10</l>
     <l n="11">Scenting the world , looking it full in face ,</l>
     <l n="12">An old dog , bald and blindish , at his heels .</l>
     <l n="13">They turned up , now , the alley by the church ,</l>
     <l n="14">That leads nowhither ; now , they breathed themselves</l>
     <l n="15">On the main promenade just at the wrong time ; 15</l>
     <l n="16">You 'd come upon his scrutinizing hat ,</l>
     <l n="17">Making a peaked shade blacker than itself</l>
     <l n="18">Against the single window spared some house</l>
     <l n="19">Intact yet with its moldered Moorish work —</l>
     <l n="20">Or else surprise the ferrel of his stick 20</l>
     <l n="21">Trying the mortar 's temper ‘ tween the chinks</l>
     <l n="22">Of some new shop a-building , French and fine .</l>
     <l n="23">He stood and watched the cobbler at his trade ,</l>
     <l n="24">The man who slices lemons into drink ,</l>
     <l n="25">The coffee-roaster 's brazier , and the boys 25</l>
     <l n="26">That volunteer to help him turn its winch .</l>
     <l n="27">He glanced o'er books on stalls with half an eye ,</l>
     <l n="28">And fly-leaf ballads on the vender 's string ,</l>
     <l n="29">And broad-edge bold-print posters by the wall .</l>
     <l n="30">He took such cognizance of men and things , 30</l>
     <l n="31">If any beat a horse , you felt he saw ;</l>
     <l n="32">If any cursed a woman , he took note ;</l>
     <l n="33">Yet stared at nobody — you stared at him ,</l>
     <l n="34">And found , less to your pleasure than surprise ,</l>
     <l n="35">He seemed to know you and expect as much . 35</l>
     <l n="36">So , next time that a neighbor 's tongue was loosed ,</l>
     <l n="37">It marked the shameful and notorious fact ,</l>
     <l n="38">We had among us , not so much a spy ,</l>
     <l n="39">As a recording chief-inquisitor ,</l>
     <l n="40">The town 's true master if the town but knew ! 40</l>
     <l n="41">We merely kept a governor for form ,</l>
     <l n="42">While this man walked about and took account</l>
     <l n="43">Of all thought , said and acted , then went home ,</l>
     <l n="44">And wrote it fully to our Lord the King</l>
     <l n="45">Who has an itch to know things , he knows why , 45</l>
     <l n="46">And reads them in his bedroom of a night .</l>
     <l n="47">Oh , you might smile ! there wanted not a touch ,</l>
     <l n="48">A tang of ... well , it was not wholly ease</l>
     <l n="49">As back into your mind the man 's look came .</l>
     <l n="50">Stricken in years a little — such a brow 50</l>
     <l n="51">His eyes had to live under !— clear as flint</l>
     <l n="52">On either side the formidable nose</l>
     <l n="53">Curved , cut and colored like an eagle 's claw .</l>
     <l n="54">Had he to do with A 's surprising fate ?</l>
     <l n="55">When altogether old B disappeared 55</l>
     <l n="56">And young C got his mistress — was't our friend ,</l>
     <l n="57">His letter to the King , that did it all ?</l>
     <l n="58">What paid the bloodless man for so much pains ?</l>
     <l n="59">Our Lord the King has favorites manifold ,</l>
     <l n="60">And shifts his ministry some once a month ; 60</l>
     <l n="61">Our city gets new governors at whiles —</l>
     <l n="62">But never word or sign , that I could hear ,</l>
     <l n="63">Notified to this man about the streets</l>
     <l n="64">The King 's approval of those letters conned</l>
     <l n="65">The last thing duly at the dead of night . 65</l>
     <l n="66">Did the man love his office ? Frowned our Lord ,</l>
     <l n="67">Exhorting when none heard — “ Beseech me not !</l>
     <l n="68">Too far above my people — beneath me !</l>
     <l n="69">I set the watch — how should the people know ?</l>
     <l n="70">Forget them , keep me all the more in mind ! ” 70</l>
     <l n="71">Was some such understanding ‘ twixt the two ?</l>

     <l n="72">I found no truth in one report at least —</l>
     <l n="73">That if you tracked him to his home , down lanes</l>
     <l n="74">Beyond the Jewry , and as clean to pace ,</l>
     <l n="75">You found he ate his supper in a room 75</l>
     <l n="76">Blazing with lights , four Titians on the walls ,</l>

    <head>FRA LIPPO LIPPI</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">I am poor brother Lippo , by your leave !</l>
     <l n="2">You need not clap your torches to my face .</l>
     <l n="3">Zooks , what 's to blame ? you think you see a monk !</l>
     <l n="4">What , ‘ tis past midnight , and you go the rounds ,</l>
     <l n="5">And here you catch me at an alley 's end 5</l>
     <l n="6">Where sportive ladies leave their doors ajar ?</l>
     <l n="7">The Carmine 's my cloister : hunt it up ,</l>
     <l n="8">Do — harry out , if you must show your zeal ,</l>
     <l n="9">Whatever rat , there , haps on his wrong hole ,</l>
     <l n="10">And nip each softling of a wee white mouse , 10</l>
     <l n="11">Weke , weke , that 's crept to keep him company !</l>
     <l n="12">Aha , you know your betters ! Then , you 'll take</l>
     <l n="13">Your hand away that 's fiddling on my throat ,</l>
     <l n="14">And please to know me likewise . Who am I ?</l>
     <l n="15">Why , one , sir , who is lodging with a friend 15</l>
     <l n="16">Three streets off — he 's a certain ... how d'ye call ?</l>
     <l n="17">Master — a ... Cosimo of the Medici ,</l>
     <l n="18">I ’ the house that caps the corner . Boh ! you were best !</l>
     <l n="19">Remember and tell me , the day you 're hanged ,</l>
     <l n="20">How you affected such a gullet'shYpppHeNgripe ! 20</l>
     <l n="21">But you , sir , it concerns you that your knaves</l>
     <l n="22">Pick up a manner nor discredit you :</l>
     <l n="23">Zooks , are we pilchards , that they sweep the streets</l>
     <l n="24">And count fair prize what comes into their net ?</l>
     <l n="25">He 's Judas to a tittle , that man is ! 25</l>
     <l n="26">Just such a face ! Why , sir , you make amends .</l>
     <l n="27">Lord , I 'm not angry ! Bid your hangdogs go</l>
     <l n="28">Drink out this quarter-florin to the health</l>
     <l n="29">Of the munificent House that harbors me</l>
     <l n="30">( And many more beside , lads ! more beside ! ) 30</l>
     <l n="31">And all 's come square again . I 'd like his face —</l>
     <l n="32">His , elbowing on his comrade in the door</l>
     <l n="33">With the pike and lantern — for the slave that holds</l>
     <l n="34">John Baptist 's head a-dangle by the hair</l>
     <l n="35">With one hand ( “ Look you , now , ” as who should say ) 35</l>
     <l n="36">And his weapon in the other , yet unwiped !</l>
     <l n="37">It 's not your chance to have a bit of chalk ,</l>
     <l n="38">A wood-coal , or the like ? or you should see !</l>
     <l n="39">Yes , I 'm the painter , since you style me so .</l>
     <l n="40">What , brother Lippo 's doings , up and down , 40</l>
     <l n="41">You know them and they take you ? like enough !</l>
     <l n="42">I saw the proper twinkle in your eye —</l>
     <l n="43">‘ Tell you , I liked your looks at very first .</l>
     <l n="44">Let 's sit and set things straight now , hip to haunch .</l>
     <l n="45">Here 's spring come , and the nights one makes up bands 45</l>
     <l n="46">To roam the town and sing out carnival ,</l>
     <l n="47">And I 've been three weeks shut within my mew ,</l>
     <l n="48">A-painting for the great man , saints and saints</l>
     <l n="49">And saints again . I could not paint all night —</l>
     <l n="50">Ouf ! I leaned out of window for fresh air . 50</l>
     <l n="51">There came a hurry of feet and little feet ,</l>
     <l n="52">A sweep of lute-strings , laughs , and whifts of song —</l>
     <l n="53">Flower o ’ the broom ,</l>
     <l n="54">Take away love , and our earth is a tomb !</l>
     <l n="55">Flower o ’ the quince , 55</l>
     <l n="56">I let Lisa go , and what good in life since ?</l>
     <l n="57">Flower o ’ the thyme — and so on . Round they went .</l>
     <l n="58">Scarce had they turned the corner when a titter</l>
     <l n="59">Like the skipping of rabbits by moonlight — three slim shapes ,</l>
     <l n="60">And a face that looked up ... zooks , sir , flesh and blood , 60</l>
     <l n="61">That 's all I 'm made of ! Into shreds it went ,</l>
     <l n="62">Curtain and counterpane and coverlet ,</l>
     <l n="63">All the bed-furniture — a dozen knots ,</l>
     <l n="64">There was a ladder ! Down I let myself ,</l>
     <l n="65">Hands and feet , scrambling somehow , and so dropped , 65</l>
     <l n="66">And after them . I came up with the fun</l>
     <l n="67">Hard by Saint Laurence , hail fellow , well met —</l>
     <l n="68">Flower o ’ the rose ,</l>
     <l n="69">If I 've been merry , what matter who knows ?</l>
     <l n="70">And so I was stealing back again 70</l>
     <l n="71">To get to bed and have a bit of sleep</l>
     <l n="72">Ere I rise up tomorrow and go work</l>
     <l n="73">On Jerome knocking at his poor old breast</l>
     <l n="74">With his great round stone to subdue the flesh ,</l>
     <l n="75">You snap me of the sudden . Ah , I see ! 75</l>
     <l n="76">Though your eye twinkles still , you shake your head —</l>
     <l n="77">Mine 's shaved — a monk , you say — the sting 's in that !</l>
     <l n="78">If Master Cosimo announced himself ,</l>
     <l n="79">Mum 's the word naturally ; but a monk !</l>
     <l n="80">Come , what am I a beast for ? tell us , now ! 80</l>
     <l n="81">I was a baby when my mother died</l>
     <l n="82">And father died and left me in the street .</l>
     <l n="83">I starved there , God knows how , a year or two</l>
     <l n="84">On fig-skins , melon-parings , rinds and shucks ,</l>
     <l n="85">Refuse and rubbish . One fine frosty day , 85</l>
     <l n="86">My stomach being empty as your hat ,</l>
     <l n="87">The wind doubled me up and down I went .</l>
     <l n="88">Old Aunt Lapaccia trussed me with one hand</l>
     <l n="89">( Its fellow was a stinger as I knew ) ,</l>
     <l n="90">And so along the wall , over the bridge , 90</l>
     <l n="91">By the straight cut to the convent . Six words there ,</l>
     <l n="92">While I stood munching my first bread that month :</l>
     <l n="93">“ So , boy , you 've minded , ” quoth the good fat father ,</l>
     <l n="94">Wiping his own mouth — ‘ twas refection-time —</l>
     <l n="95">“ To quit this very miserable world ? 95</l>
     <l n="96">Will you renounce ” ... “ the mouthful of bread ? ” thought I ;</l>
     <l n="97">By no means ! Brief , they made a monk of me ;</l>
     <l n="98">I did renounce the world , its pride and greed ,</l>
     <l n="99">Palace , farm , villa , shop , and banking-house ,</l>
     <l n="100">Trash , such as these poor devils of Medici 100</l>
     <l n="101">Have given their hearts to — all at eight years old .</l>
     <l n="102">Well , sir , I found in time , you may be sure ,</l>
     <l n="103">‘ Twas not for nothing — the good bellyful ,</l>
     <l n="104">The warm serge and the rope that goes all round ,</l>
     <l n="105">And day-long blessed idleness beside ! 105</l>
     <l n="106">“ Let 's see what the urchin 's fit for ” — that came next .</l>
     <l n="107">Not overmuch their way , I must confess .</l>
     <l n="108">Such a to-do ! They tried me with their books ;</l>
     <l n="109">Lord , they 'd have taught me Latin in pure waste !</l>
     <l n="110">Flower o ’ the clove , 110</l>
     <l n="111">All the Latin I construe is “ amo , ” I love !</l>
     <l n="112">But , mind you , when a boy starves in the streets</l>
     <l n="113">Eight years together , as my fortune was ,</l>
     <l n="114">Watching folk 's faces to know who will fling</l>
     <l n="115">The bit of half-stripped grape-bunch he desires , 115</l>
     <l n="116">And who will curse or kick him for his pains —</l>
     <l n="117">Which gentleman processional and fine ,</l>
     <l n="118">Holding a candle to the Sacrament ,</l>
     <l n="119">Will wink and let him lift a plate and catch</l>
     <l n="120">The droppings of the wax to sell again , 120</l>
     <l n="121">Or holla for the Eight and have him whipped —</l>
     <l n="122">How say I ?— nay , which dog bites , which lets drop</l>
     <l n="123">His bone from the heap of offal in the street —</l>
     <l n="124">Why , soul and sense of him grow sharp alike ,</l>
     <l n="125">He learns the look of things , and none the less 125</l>
     <l n="126">For admonition from the hunger-pinch .</l>
     <l n="127">I had a store of such remarks , be sure ,</l>
     <l n="128">Which , after I found leisure , turned to use .</l>
     <l n="129">I drew men 's faces on my copy books ,</l>
     <l n="130">Scrawled them within the antiphonary 's marge , 130</l>
     <l n="131">Joined legs and arms to the long music-notes ,</l>
     <l n="132">Found eyes and nose and chin for A 's and B 's ,</l>
     <l n="133">And made a string of pictures of the world</l>
     <l n="134">Betwixt the ins and outs of verb and noun ,</l>
     <l n="135">On the wall , the bench , the door . The monks looked black . 135</l>
     <l n="136">“ Nay , ” quoth the Prior , “ turn him out , d'ye say ?</l>
     <l n="137">In no wise . Lose a crow and catch a lark .</l>
     <l n="138">What if at last we get our man of parts ,</l>
     <l n="139">We Carmelites , like those Camaldolese</l>
     <l n="140">And Preaching Friars , to do our church up fine 140</l>
     <l n="141">And put the front on it that ought to be ! ”</l>
     <l n="142">And hereupon he bade me daub away .</l>
     <l n="143">Thank you ! my head being crammed , the walls a blank ,</l>
     <l n="144">Never was such prompt disemburdening .</l>
     <l n="145">First , every sort of monk , the black and white , 145</l>
     <l n="146">I drew them , fat and lean : then , folk at church ,</l>
     <l n="147">From good old gossips waiting to confess</l>
     <l n="148">Their cribs of barrel-droppings , candle-ends —</l>
     <l n="149">To the breathless fellow at the altar-foot ,</l>
     <l n="150">Fresh from his murder , safe and sitting there 150</l>
     <l n="151">With the little children round him in a row</l>
     <l n="152">Of admiration , half for his beard and half</l>
     <l n="153">For that white anger of his victim 's son</l>
     <l n="154">Shaking a fist at him with one fierce arm ,</l>
     <l n="155">Signing himself with the other because of Christ 155</l>
     <l n="156">( Whose sad face on the cross sees only this</l>
     <l n="157">After the passion of a thousand years )</l>
     <l n="158">Till some poor girl , her apron o'er her head ,</l>
     <l n="159">( Which the intense eyes looked through ) came at eve</l>
     <l n="160">On tiptoe , said a word , dropped in a loaf , 160</l>
     <l n="161">Her pair of earrings and a bunch of flowers</l>
     <l n="162">( The brute took growling ) , prayed , and so was gone .</l>
     <l n="163">I painted all , then cried , “ ‘ Tis ask and have ;</l>
     <l n="164">Choose , for more 's ready ! ” — laid the ladder flat ,</l>
     <l n="165">And showed my covered bit of cloister-wall . 165</l>
     <l n="166">The monks closed in a circle and praised loud</l>
     <l n="167">Till checked , taught what to see and not to see ,</l>
     <l n="168">Being simple bodies — “ That 's the very man !</l>
     <l n="169">Look at the boy who stoops to pat the dog !</l>
     <l n="170">That woman 's like the Prior 's niece who comes 170</l>
     <l n="171">To care about his asthma : it 's the life ! ”</l>
     <l n="172">But there my triumph 's straw-fire flared and funked ;</l>
     <l n="173">Their betters took their turn to see and say :</l>
     <l n="174">The Prior and the learned pulled a face</l>
     <l n="175">And stopped all that in no time . “ How ? what 's here ? 175</l>
     <l n="176">Quite from the mark of painting , bless us all !</l>
     <l n="177">Faces , arms , legs , and bodies like the true</l>
     <l n="178">As much as pea and pea ! It 's devil'shYpppHeNgame !</l>
     <l n="179">Your business is not to catch men with show ,</l>
     <l n="180">With homage to the perishable clay , 180</l>
     <l n="181">But lift them over it , ignore it all ,</l>
     <l n="182">Make them forget there 's such a thing as flesh .</l>
     <l n="183">Your business is to paint the souls of men — -</l>
     <l n="184">Man 's soul , and it 's a fire , smoke ... no , it 's not ...</l>
     <l n="185">It 's vapor done up like a new-born babe — 185</l>
     <l n="186">( In that shape when you die it leaves your mouth )</l>
     <l n="187">It 's ... well , what matters talking , it 's the soul !</l>
     <l n="188">Give us no more of body than shows soul !</l>
     <l n="189">Here 's Giotto , with his Saint a-praising God ,</l>
     <l n="190">That sets us praising — why not stop with him ? 190</l>
     <l n="191">Why put all thoughts of praise out of our head</l>
     <l n="192">With wonder at lines , colors , and what not ?</l>
     <l n="193">Paint the soul ; never mind the legs and arms !</l>
     <l n="194">Rub all out ; try at it a second time .</l>
     <l n="195">Oh , that white smallish female with the breasts , 195</l>
     <l n="196">She 's just my niece ... Herodias , I would say —</l>
     <l n="197">Who went and danced and got men 's heads cut off !</l>
     <l n="198">Have it all out ! ” Now , is this sense , I ask ?</l>
     <l n="199">A fine way to paint soul , by painting body</l>
     <l n="200">So ill the eye can n't stop there , must go further , 200</l>
     <l n="201">And can n't fare worse ! Thus , yellow does for white</l>
     <l n="202">When what you put for yellow 's simply black ,</l>
     <l n="203">And any sort of meaning looks intense</l>
     <l n="204">When all beside itself means and looks naught .</l>
     <l n="205">Why can n't a painter lift each foot in turn , 205</l>
     <l n="206">Left foot and right foot , go a double step ,</l>
     <l n="207">Make his flesh liker and his soul more like ,</l>
     <l n="208">Both in their order ? Take the prettiest face ,</l>
     <l n="209">The Prior 's niece ... patron-saint — is it so pretty</l>
     <l n="210">You can n't discover if it means hope , fear , 210</l>
     <l n="211">Sorrow , or joy ? Wo n't beauty go with these ?</l>
     <l n="212">Suppose I 've made her eyes all right and blue ,</l>
     <l n="213">Ca n't I take breath and try to add life 's flash ,</l>
     <l n="214">And then add soul and heighten them three-fold ?</l>
     <l n="215">Or say there 's beauty with no soul at all — 215</l>
     <l n="216">( I never saw it — put the case the same —)</l>
     <l n="217">If you get simple beauty and naught else ,</l>
     <l n="218">You get about the best thing God invents :</l>
     <l n="219">That 's somewhat : and you 'll find the soul you have missed ,</l>
     <l n="220">Within yourself , when you return Him thanks . 220</l>
     <l n="221">“ Rub all out ! ” Well , well , there 's my life , in short ,</l>
     <l n="222">And so the thing has gone on ever since .</l>
     <l n="223">I 'm grown a man no doubt ; I 've broken bounds :</l>
     <l n="224">You should not take a fellow eight years old</l>
     <l n="225">And make him swear to never kiss the girls . 225</l>
     <l n="226">I 'm my own master , paint now as I please —</l>

     <l n="228">Lord , it 's fast holding by the rings in front —</l>
     <l n="229">Those great rings serve more purposes than just</l>
     <l n="230">To plant a flag in , or tie up a horse ! 230</l>
     <l n="231">And yet the old schooling sticks , the old grave eyes</l>
     <l n="232">Are peeping o'er my shoulder as I work ,</l>
     <l n="233">The heads shake still — “ It 's art 's decline , my son !</l>
     <l n="234">You 're not of the true painters , great and old ;</l>

     <l n="243">Clench my teeth , suck my lips in tight , and paint</l>
     <l n="244">To please them — sometimes do and sometimes do n't ;</l>
     <l n="245">For , doing most , there 's pretty sure to come 245</l>
     <l n="246">A turn , some warm eve finds me at my saints —</l>
     <l n="247">A laugh , a cry , the business of the world —</l>
     <l n="248">( Flower o ’ the peach ,</l>
     <l n="249">Death for us all , and his own life for each ! )</l>
     <l n="250">And my whole soul revolves , the cup runs over , 250</l>
     <l n="251">The world and life 's too big to pass for a dream ,</l>
     <l n="252">And I do these wild things in sheer despite ,</l>
     <l n="253">And play the fooleries you catch me at ,</l>
     <l n="254">In pure rage ! The old mill-horse , out at grass</l>
     <l n="255">After hard years , throws up his stiff heels so , 255</l>
     <l n="256">Although the miller does not preach to him</l>
     <l n="257">The only good of grass is to make chaff .</l>
     <l n="258">What would men have ? Do they like grass or no —</l>

     <l n="366">I , caught up with my monk'shYpppHeNthings by mistake ,</l>

     <l n="11">I often am much wearier than you think ,</l>

     <l n="20">Tomorrow , how you shall be glad for this ! 20</l>
     <l n="21">Your soft hand is a woman of itself ,</l>

     <l n="41">There 's the bell clinking from the chapel-top ;</l>
     <l n="42">That length of convent-wall across the way</l>

     <l n="44">The last monk leaves the garden ; days decrease ,</l>
     <l n="45">And autumn grows , autumn in everything . 45</l>
     <l n="46">Eh ? the whole seems to fall into a shape</l>
     <l n="47">As if I saw alike my work and self</l>
     <l n="48">And all that I was born to be and do ,</l>
     <l n="49">A twilight-piece . Love , we are in God 's hand .</l>

     <l n="63">Do easily , too — when I say , perfectly ,</l>
     <l n="64">I do not boast , perhaps : yourself are judge ,</l>
     <l n="65">Who listened to the Legate 's talk last week , 65</l>
     <l n="66">And just as much they used to say in France .</l>
     <l n="67">At any rate ‘ tis easy , all of it !</l>
     <l n="68">No sketches first , no studies , that 's long past :</l>
     <l n="69">I do what many dream of , all their lives ,</l>
     <l n="70">— Dream ? strive to do , and agonize to do , 70</l>
     <l n="71">And fail in doing . I could count twenty such</l>
     <l n="72">On twice your fingers , and not leave this town ,</l>
     <l n="73">Who strive — you do n't know how the others strive</l>
     <l n="74">To paint a little thing like that you smeared</l>
     <l n="75">Carelessly passing with your robes afloat — 75</l>
     <l n="76">Yet do much less , so much less , Someone says ,</l>
     <l n="77">( I know his name , no matter ) — so much less !</l>
     <l n="78">Well , less is more , Lucrezia : I am judged .</l>
     <l n="79">There burns a truer light of God in them ,</l>
     <l n="80">In their vexed beating stuffed and stopped-up brain , 80</l>
     <l n="81">Heart , or whate'er else , than goes on to prompt</l>
     <l n="82">This low-pulsed forthright craftsman 's hand of mine .</l>
     <l n="83">Their works drop groundward , but themselves , I know ,</l>
     <l n="84">Reach many a time a heaven that 's shut to me ,</l>
     <l n="85">Enter and take their place there sure enough , 85</l>
     <l n="86">Though they come back and cannot tell the world .</l>
     <l n="87">My works are nearer heaven , but I sit here .</l>
     <l n="88">The sudden blood of these men ! at a word —</l>
     <l n="89">Praise them , it boils , or blame them , it boils too .</l>
     <l n="90">I , painting from myself and to myself , 90</l>
     <l n="91">Know what I do , am unmoved by men 's blame</l>
     <l n="92">Or their praise either . Somebody remarks</l>
     <l n="93">Morello 's outline there is wrongly traced ,</l>
     <l n="94">His hue mistaken ; what of that ? or else ,</l>
     <l n="95">Rightly traced and well ordered ; what of that ? 95</l>
     <l n="96">Speak as they please , what does the mountain care ?</l>
     <l n="97">Ah , but a man 's reach should exceed his grasp ,</l>
     <l n="98">Or what 's a heaven for ? All is silver-gray</l>
     <l n="99">Placid and perfect with my art : the worse !</l>
     <l n="100">I know both what I want and what might gain , 100</l>
     <l n="101">And yet how profitless to know , to sigh</l>
     <l n="102">“ Had I been two , another and myself ,</l>
     <l n="103">Our head would have o'erlooked the world ! ” No doubt .</l>
     <l n="104">Yonder 's a work now , of that famous youth</l>
     <l n="105">The Urbinate who died five years ago . 105</l>
     <l n="106">( ‘ Tis copied , George Vasari sent it me . )</l>
     <l n="107">Well , I can fancy how he did it all ,</l>
     <l n="108">Pouring his soul , with kings and popes to see ,</l>
     <l n="109">Reaching , that heaven might so replenish him ,</l>
     <l n="110">Above and through his art — for it gives way ; 110</l>
     <l n="111">That arm is wrongly put — and there again —</l>
     <l n="112">A fault to pardon in the drawing 's lines ,</l>
     <l n="113">Its body , so to speak : its soul is right ,</l>
     <l n="114">He means right — that , a child may understand .</l>
     <l n="115">Still , what an arm ! and I could alter it : 115</l>
     <l n="116">But all the play , the insight and the stretch —</l>
     <l n="117">Out of me , out of me ! And wherefore out ?</l>
     <l n="118">Had you enjoined them on me , given me soul ,</l>
     <l n="119">We might have risen to Rafael , I and you !</l>
     <l n="120">Nay , Love , you did give all I asked , I think — 120</l>
     <l n="121">More than I merit , yes , by many times .</l>
     <l n="122">But had you — oh , with the same perfect brow ,</l>
     <l n="123">And perfect eyes , and more than perfect mouth ,</l>
     <l n="124">And the low voice my soul hears , as a bird</l>
     <l n="125">The fowler 's pipe , and follows to the snare — 125</l>
     <l n="126">Had you , with these the same , but brought a mind !</l>
     <l n="127">Some women do so . Had the mouth there urged</l>
     <l n="128">“ God and the glory ! never care for gain .</l>
     <l n="129">The present by the future , what is that ?</l>
     <l n="130">Live for fame , side by side with Agnolo ! 130</l>
     <l n="131">Rafael is waiting : up to God , all three ! ”</l>
     <l n="132">I might have done it for you . So it seems :</l>
     <l n="133">Perhaps not . All is as God overrules .</l>
     <l n="134">Beside , incentives come from the soul 's self ;</l>
     <l n="135">The rest avail not . Why do I need you ? 135</l>
     <l n="136">What wife had Rafael , or has Agnolo ?</l>
     <l n="137">In this world , who can do a thing , will not ;</l>
     <l n="138">And who would do it , cannot , I perceive :</l>
     <l n="139">Yet the will 's somewhat — somewhat , too , the power —</l>
     <l n="140">And thus we half-men struggle . At the end , 140</l>
     <l n="141">God , I conclude , compensates , punishes .</l>
     <l n="142">‘ Tis safer for me , if the award be strict ,</l>
     <l n="143">That I am something underrated here ,</l>
     <l n="144">Poor this long while , despised , to speak the truth .</l>
     <l n="145">I dared not , do you know , leave home all day , 145</l>
     <l n="146">For fear of chancing on the Paris lords .</l>
     <l n="147">The best is when they pass and look aside ;</l>
     <l n="148">But they speak sometimes ; I must bear it all .</l>
     <l n="149">Well may they speak ! That Francis , that first time ,</l>
     <l n="150">And that long festal year at Fontainebleau ! 150</l>
     <l n="151">I surely then could sometimes leave the ground ,</l>
     <l n="152">Put on the glory , Rafael 's daily wear ,</l>
     <l n="153">In that humane great monarch 's golden look —</l>
     <l n="154">One finger in his beard or twisted curl</l>
     <l n="155">Over his mouth 's good mark that made the smile , 155</l>
     <l n="156">One arm about my shoulder , round my neck ,</l>
     <l n="157">The jingle of his gold chain in my ear ,</l>
     <l n="158">I , painting proudly with his breath on me ,</l>
     <l n="159">All his court round him , seeing with his eyes ,</l>
     <l n="160">Such frank French eyes , and such a fire of souls 160</l>
     <l n="161">Profuse , my hand kept plying by those hearts —</l>
     <l n="162">And , best of all , this , this , this face beyond ,</l>
     <l n="163">This in the background , waiting on my work ,</l>
     <l n="164">To crown the issue with a last reward !</l>
     <l n="165">A good time , was it not , my kingly days ? 165</l>
     <l n="166">And load you not grown restless ... but I know —</l>
     <l n="167">‘ Tis done and past ; ‘ twas right , my instinct said ;</l>
     <l n="168">Too live the life grew , golden and not gray ,</l>
     <l n="169">And I 'm the weak-eyed bat no sun should tempt</l>
     <l n="170">Out of the grange whose four walls make his world . 170</l>
     <l n="171">How could it end in any other way ?</l>
     <l n="172">You called me , and I came home to your heart .</l>
     <l n="173">The triumph was — to reach and stay there ; since</l>
     <l n="174">I reached it ere the triumph , what is lost ?</l>
     <l n="175">Let my hands frame your face in your hair 's gold , 175</l>
     <l n="176">You beautiful Lucrezia that are mine !</l>
     <l n="177">“ Rafael did this , Andrea painted that ;</l>
     <l n="178">The Roman 's is the better when you pray ,</l>
     <l n="179">But still the other 's Virgin was his wife ” —</l>
     <l n="180">Men will excuse me . I am glad to judge 180</l>
     <l n="181">Both pictures in your presence ; clearer grows</l>
     <l n="182">My better fortune , I resolve to think .</l>
     <l n="183">For , do you know , Lucrezia , as God lives ,</l>
     <l n="184">Said one day Agnolo , his very self ,</l>
     <l n="185">To Rafael ... I have known it all these years ... 185</l>
     <l n="186">( When the young man was flaming out his thoughts</l>
     <l n="187">Upon a palace-wall for Rome to see ,</l>
     <l n="188">Too lifted up in heart because of it )</l>
     <l n="189">“ Friend , there 's a certain sorry little scrub</l>
     <l n="190">Goes up and down our Florence , none cares how , 190</l>
     <l n="191">Who , were he set to plan and execute</l>
     <l n="192">As you are , pricked on by your popes and kings ,</l>
     <l n="193">Would bring the sweat into that brow of yours ! ”</l>
     <l n="194">To Rafael 's !— And indeed the arm is wrong .</l>
     <l n="195">I hardly dare ... yet , only you to see , 195</l>
     <l n="196">Give the chalk here — quick , thus the line should go !</l>
     <l n="197">Aye , but the soul ! he 's Rafael ! rub it out !</l>
     <l n="198">Still , all I care for , if he spoke the truth ,</l>
     <l n="199">( What he ? why , who but Michel Agnolo ?</l>
     <l n="200">Do you forget already words like those ? ) 200</l>
     <l n="201">If really there was such a chance , so lost —</l>
     <l n="202">Is , whether you 're — not grateful — but more pleased .</l>
     <l n="203">Well , let me think so . And you smile indeed !</l>
     <l n="204">This hour has been an hour ! Another smile ?</l>
     <l n="205">If you would sit thus by me every night 205</l>
     <l n="206">I should work better , do you comprehend ?</l>
     <l n="207">I mean that I should earn more , give you more .</l>
     <l n="208">See , it is settled dusk now ; there 's a star ;</l>
     <l n="209">Morello 's gone , the watch-lights show the wall ,</l>
     <l n="210">The cue-owls speak the name we call them by . 210</l>
     <l n="211">Come from the window , love — come in , at last ,</l>
     <l n="212">Inside the melancholy little house</l>
     <l n="213">We built to be so gay with . God is just .</l>
     <l n="214">King Francis may forgive me : oft at nights</l>
     <l n="215">When I look up from painting , eyes tired out , 215</l>
     <l n="216">The walls become illumined , brick from brick</l>
     <l n="217">Distinct , instead of mortar , fierce bright gold ,</l>
     <l n="218">That gold of his I did cement them with !</l>
     <l n="219">Let us but love each other . Must you go ?</l>
     <l n="220">That Cousin here again ? He waits outside ? 220</l>
     <l n="221">Must see you — you , and not with me ? Those loans ?</l>
     <l n="222">More gaming debts to pay ? You smiled for that ?</l>
     <l n="223">Well , let smiles buy me ! Have you more to spend ?</l>
     <l n="224">While hand and eye and something of a heart</l>
     <l n="225">Are left me , work 's my ware , and what 's it worth ? 225</l>
     <l n="226">I 'll pay my fancy . Only let me sit</l>
     <l n="227">The gray remainder of the evening out ,</l>

     <l n="230">One picture , just one more — the Virgin 's face , 230</l>
     <l n="231">Not yours this time ! I want you at my side</l>

    <head>THE BISHOP ORDERS HIS TOMB AT SAINT PRAXED 'S CHURCH</head>
    <head>ROME , 15 —</head>
     <l n="1">Vanity , saith the preacher , vanity !</l>
     <l n="2">Draw round my bed : is Anselm keeping back ?</l>
     <l n="3">Nephews — sons mine ... ah God , I know not ! Well —</l>
     <l n="4">She , men would have to be your mother once ,</l>
     <l n="5">Old Gandolf envied me , so fair she was ! 5</l>
     <l n="6">What 's done is done , and she is dead beside ,</l>
     <l n="7">Dead long ago , and I am Bishop since ,</l>
     <l n="8">And as she died so must we die ourselves ,</l>
     <l n="9">And thence ye may perceive the world 's a dream .</l>
     <l n="10">Life , how and what is it ? As here I lie 10</l>
     <l n="11">In this state-chamber , dying by degrees ,</l>
     <l n="12">Hours and long hours in the dead night , I ask</l>
     <l n="13">“ Do I live , am I dead ? ” Peace , peace seems all .</l>
     <l n="14">Saint Praxed 's ever was the church for peace ;</l>
     <l n="15">And so , about this tomb of mine . I fought 15</l>
     <l n="16">With tooth and nail to save my niche , ye know :</l>
     <l n="17">— Old Gandolf cozened me , despite my care ;</l>
     <l n="18">Shrewd was that snatch from out the corner South</l>
     <l n="19">He graced his carrion with , God curse the same !</l>
     <l n="20">Yet still my niche is not so cramped but thence 20</l>
     <l n="21">One sees the pulpit o ’ the epistle-side ,</l>
     <l n="22">And somewhat of the choir , those silent seats ,</l>
     <l n="23">And up into the aery dome where live</l>
     <l n="24">The angels , and a sunbeam 's sure to lurk :</l>
     <l n="25">And I shall fill my slab of basalt there , 25</l>
     <l n="26">And ‘ neath my tabernacle take my rest ,</l>
     <l n="27">With those nine columns round me , two and two ,</l>
     <l n="28">The odd one at my feet where Anselm stands :</l>
     <l n="29">Peach-blossom marble all , the rare , the ripe</l>
     <l n="30">As fresh-poured red wine of a mighty pulse . 30</l>
     <l n="31">— Old Gandolf with his paltry onion-stone ,</l>
     <l n="32">Put me where I may look at him ! True peach ,</l>
     <l n="33">Rosy and flawless : how I earned the prize !</l>
     <l n="34">Draw close : that conflagration of my church</l>
     <l n="35">— What then ? So much was saved if aught were missed ! 35</l>
     <l n="36">My sons , ye would not be my death ? Go dig</l>
     <l n="37">The white-grape vineyard where the oil-press stood ,</l>
     <l n="38">Drop water gently till the surface sink ,</l>
     <l n="39">And if ye find ... Ah God , I know not , I ! ...</l>
     <l n="40">Bedded in store of rotten fig-leaves soft , 40</l>
     <l n="41">And corded up in a tight olive-frail ,</l>
     <l n="42">Some lump , ah God , of lapis lazuli ,</l>
     <l n="43">Big as a Jew 's head cut off at the nape ,</l>
     <l n="44">Blue as a vein o'er the Madonna 's breast ...</l>
     <l n="45">Sons , all have I bequeathed you , villas , all , 45</l>
     <l n="46">That brave Frascati villa with its bath ,</l>
     <l n="47">So , let the blue lump poise between my knees ,</l>
     <l n="48">Like God the Father 's globe on both his hands</l>
     <l n="49">Ye worship in the Jesu Church so gay ,</l>
     <l n="50">For Gandolf shall not choose but see and burst ! 50</l>
     <l n="51">Swift as a weaver 's shuttle fleet our years :</l>
     <l n="52">Man goeth to the grave , and where is he ?</l>
     <l n="53">Did I say basalt for my slab , sons ? Black —</l>
     <l n="54">‘ Twas ever antique-black I meant ! How else</l>
     <l n="55">Shall ye contrast my frieze to come beneath ? 55</l>
     <l n="56">The bas-relief in bronze ye promised me ,</l>
     <l n="57">Those Pan and Nymphs ye wot of , and perchance</l>
     <l n="58">Some tripod , thyrsus , with a vase or so ,</l>
     <l n="59">The Savior at his sermon on the mount ,</l>
     <l n="60">Saint Praxed in a glory , and one Pan 60</l>
     <l n="61">Ready to twitch the Nymph 's last garment off ,</l>
     <l n="62">And Moses with the tables ... but I know</l>
     <l n="63">Ye mark me not ! What do they whisper thee ,</l>
     <l n="64">Child of my bowels , Anselm ? Ah , ye hope</l>
     <l n="65">To revel down my villas while I gasp 65</l>
     <l n="66">Bricked o'er with beggar 's moldy travertine</l>
     <l n="67">Which Gandolf from his tomb-top chuckles at !</l>
     <l n="68">Nay , boys , ye love me — all of jasper , then !</l>
     <l n="69">‘ Tis jasper ye stand pledged to , lest I grieve</l>
     <l n="70">My bath must needs be left behind , alas ! 70</l>
     <l n="71">One block , pure green as a pistachio-nut ,</l>
     <l n="72">There 's plenty jasper somewhere in the world —</l>
     <l n="73">And have I not Saint Praxed 's ear to pray</l>
     <l n="74">Horses for ye , and brown Greek manuscripts ,</l>
     <l n="75">And mistresses with great smooth marbly limbs ? 75</l>
     <l n="76">— That 's if ye carve my epitaph aright ,</l>

     <l n="76">Being , as I find much reason to conceive , 75</l>
     <l n="77">Intended to be viewed eventually</l>
     <l n="78">As a great whole , not analyzed to parts ,</l>

     <l n="82">Was the thing done ?— then , what 's to do again ?</l>
     <l n="83">See , in the checkered pavement opposite ,</l>
     <l n="84">Suppose the artist made a perfect rhomb ,</l>
     <l n="85">And next a lozenge , then a trapezoid —</l>
     <l n="86">He did not overlay them , superimpose 85</l>
     <l n="87">The new upon the old and blot it out ,</l>
     <l n="88">But laid them on a level in his work ,</l>
     <l n="89">Making at last a picture ; there it lies .</l>
     <l n="90">So , first the perfect separate forms were made ,</l>
     <l n="91">The portions of mankind ; and after , so , 90</l>
     <l n="92">Occurred the combination of the same .</l>

     <l n="94">Mankind , made up of all the single men —</l>
     <l n="95">In such a synthesis the labor ends .</l>
     <l n="96">Now mark me ! those divine men of old time 95</l>
     <l n="97">Have reached , thou sayest well , each at one point</l>
     <l n="98">The outside verge that rounds our faculty ;</l>
     <l n="99">And where they reached , who can do more than reach ?</l>
     <l n="100">It takes but little water just to touch</l>
     <l n="101">At some one point the inside of a sphere , 100</l>
     <l n="102">And , as we turn the sphere , touch all the rest</l>
     <l n="103">In due succession ; but the finer air</l>
     <l n="104">Which not so palpably nor obviously ,</l>
     <l n="105">Though no less universally , can touch</l>
     <l n="106">The whole circumference of that emptied sphere , 105</l>
     <l n="107">Fills it more fully than the water did ;</l>
     <l n="108">Holds thrice the weight of water in itself</l>
     <l n="109">Resolved into a subtler element .</l>
     <l n="110">And yet the vulgar call the sphere first full</l>
     <l n="111">Up to the visible height — and after , void ; 110</l>
     <l n="112">Not knowing air 's more hidden properties .</l>
     <l n="113">And thus our soul , misknown , cries out to Zeus</l>
     <l n="114">To vindicate his purpose in our life :</l>
     <l n="115">Why stay we on the earth unless to grow ?</l>
     <l n="116">Long since , I imaged , wrote the fiction out , 115</l>
     <l n="117">That he or other god descended here</l>
     <l n="118">And , once for all , showed simultaneously</l>
     <l n="119">What , in its nature , never can be shown ,</l>
     <l n="120">Piecemeal or in succession — showed , I say ,</l>
     <l n="121">The worth both absolute and relative 120</l>
     <l n="122">Of all his children from the birth of time ,</l>
     <l n="123">His instruments for all appointed work .</l>
     <l n="124">I now go on to image — might we hear</l>
     <l n="125">The judgment which should give the due to each ,</l>
     <l n="126">Show where the labor lay and where the ease , 125</l>
     <l n="127">And prove Zeus ’ self , the latent everywhere !</l>
     <l n="128">This is a dream — but no dream , let us hope ,</l>
     <l n="129">That years and days , the summers and the springs ,</l>
     <l n="130">Follow each other with unwaning powers .</l>
     <l n="131">The grapes which dye thy wine are richer far , 130</l>

     <l n="4">Her bloodhounds through the countryside .</l>
     <l n="5">Breathed hot and instant on my trace — 5</l>
     <l n="6">I made six days a hiding-place</l>

     <l n="17">Close covered o'er in my recess ,</l>
     <l n="18">Up to the neck in ferns and cress ,</l>
     <l n="19">Thinking of Metternich our friend ,</l>

     <l n="21">And much beside , two days ; the third ,</l>
     <l n="22">Hunger o'ercame me when I heard</l>

     <l n="24">To work among the maize ; you know ,</l>
     <l n="25">With us in Lombardy , they bring 25</l>
     <l n="26">Provisions packed on mules , a string</l>
     <l n="27">With little bells that cheer their task ,</l>

     <l n="35">To help , I knew . When these had passed , 35</l>
     <l n="36">I threw my glove to strike the last ,</l>

     <l n="38">Much less cry out , but stooped apart ,</l>
     <l n="39">One instant rapidly glanced round ,</l>

     <l n="41">A wild bush grows and hides my crypt ;</l>
     <l n="42">She picked my glove up while she stripped</l>
     <l n="43">A branch off , then rejoined the rest</l>
     <l n="44">With that ; my glove lay in her breast .</l>
     <l n="45">Then I drew breath ; they disappeared ; 45</l>

     <l n="47">An hour , and she returned alone</l>

     <l n="50">Rested the hopes of Italy ; 50</l>
     <l n="51">I had devised a certain tale</l>
     <l n="52">Which , when ‘ twas told her , could not fail</l>
     <l n="53">Persuade a peasant of its truth ;</l>
     <l n="54">I meant to call a freak of youth</l>
     <l n="55">This hiding , and give hopes of pay , 55</l>
     <l n="56">And no temptation to betray .</l>

     <l n="58">Its calm simplicity of grace ,</l>
     <l n="59">Our Italy 's own attitude</l>
     <l n="60">In which she walked thus far , and stood , 60</l>
     <l n="61">Planting each naked foot so firm ,</l>
     <l n="62">To crush the snake and spare the worm —</l>
     <l n="63">At first sight of her eyes , I said ,</l>
     <l n="64">“ I am that man upon whose head</l>

     <l n="76">And wait till Tenebræ begin ;</l>
     <l n="77">Walk to the third confessional ,</l>
     <l n="78">Between the pillar and the wall ,</l>
     <l n="79">And kneeling whisper , Whence comes peace ?</l>

     <l n="3">Day !</l>
     <l n="4">Faster and more fast ,</l>
     <l n="5">O'er night 's brim , day boils at last ;</l>
     <l n="6">Boils , pure gold , o'er the cloud-cup 's brim</l>
     <l n="7">Where spurting and suppressed it lay , 5</l>
     <l n="8">For not a froth-flake touched the rim</l>
     <l n="9">Of yonder gap in the solid gray</l>
     <l n="10">Of the eastern cloud , an hour away ;</l>
     <l n="11">But forth one wavelet , then another , curled ,</l>
     <l n="12">Till the whole sunrise , not to be suppressed , 10</l>
     <l n="13">Rose , reddened , and its seething breast</l>
     <l n="14">Flickered in bounds , grew gold , than overflowed the world .</l>

     <l n="15">Oh , Day , if I squander a wavelet of thee ,</l>
     <l n="16">A mite of my twelve hours ’ treasure ,</l>

     <l n="29">At hand here , and enjoy the higher lot ,</l>
     <l n="30">In readiness to take what thou wilt give ,</l>

     <l n="33">Me , who am only Pippa — old-year 's sorrow ,</l>
     <l n="34">Cast off last night , will come again tomorrow ;</l>

     <l n="37">All other men and women that this earth 35</l>

     <l n="42">What were all earth else , with a feel of heaven — 40</l>
     <l n="43">Sole light that helps me through the year , thy sun 's !</l>
     <l n="44">Try now ! Take Asolo 's Four Happiest Ones —</l>
     <l n="45">And let thy morning rain on that superb</l>
     <l n="46">Great haughty Ottima ; can rain disturb</l>
     <l n="47">Her Sebald 's homage ? All the while thy rain 45</l>
     <l n="48">Beats fiercest on her shrub-house windowpane ,</l>
     <l n="49">He will but press the closer , breathe more warm</l>
     <l n="50">Against her cheek ; how should she mind the storm ?</l>
     <l n="51">And , morning past , if midday shed a gloom</l>
     <l n="52">O'er Jules and Phene — what care bride and groom 50</l>
     <l n="53">Save for their dear selves ? ‘ Tis their marriage-day ;</l>
     <l n="54">And while they leave church and go home their way ,</l>
     <l n="55">Hand clasping hand , within each breast would be</l>
     <l n="56">Sunbeams and pleasant weather spite of thee .</l>
     <l n="57">Then , for another trial , obscure thy eve 55</l>
     <l n="58">With mist — will Luigi and his mother grieve —</l>
     <l n="59">The lady and her child , unmatched , forsooth ,</l>
     <l n="60">She in her age , as Luigi in his youth ,</l>
     <l n="61">For true content ? The cheerful town , warm , close ,</l>
     <l n="62">And safe , the sooner that thou art morose , 60</l>
     <l n="63">Receives them . And yet once again , outbreak</l>
     <l n="64">In storm at night on Monsignor , they make</l>
     <l n="65">Such stir about — whom they expect from Rome</l>
     <l n="66">To visit Asolo , his brothers ’ home ,</l>
     <l n="67">And say here masses proper to release 65</l>
     <l n="68">A soul from pain — what storm dares hurt his peace ?</l>
     <l n="69">Calm would he pray , with his own thoughts to ward</l>
     <l n="70">Thy thunder off , nor want the angels ’ guard .</l>
     <l n="71">But Pippa — just one such mischance would spoil</l>
     <l n="72">Her day that lightens the next twelve-month 's toil 70</l>
     <l n="73">At wearisome silk-winding , coil on coil !</l>
     <l n="74">And here I let time slip for naught !</l>
     <l n="75">Aha , you foolhardy sunbeam , caught</l>
     <l n="76">With a single splash from my ewer !</l>
     <l n="77">You that would mock the best pursuer , 75</l>
     <l n="78">Was my basin over-deep ?</l>
     <l n="79">One splash of water ruins you asleep ,</l>
     <l n="80">And up , up , fleet your brilliant bits</l>
     <l n="81">Wheeling and counterwheeling ,</l>
     <l n="82">Reeling , broken beyond healing — 80</l>
     <l n="83">Now grow together on the ceiling !</l>
     <l n="84">That will task your wits .</l>
     <l n="85">Whoever it was quenched fire first , hoped to see</l>
     <l n="86">Morsel after morsel flee</l>
     <l n="87">As merrily , as giddily ... 85</l>
     <l n="88">Meantime , what lights my sunbeam on ,</l>
     <l n="89">Where settles by degrees the radiant cripple ?</l>
     <l n="90">Oh , is it surely blown , my martagon ?</l>
     <l n="91">New-blown and ruddy as St. Agnes ’ nipple ,</l>
     <l n="92">Plump as the flesh-bunch on some Turk bird 's poll ! 90</l>
     <l n="93">Be sure if corals , branching ‘ neath the ripple</l>
     <l n="94">Of ocean , bud there , fairies watch unroll</l>
     <l n="95">Such turban-flowers ; I say , such lamps disperse</l>

   <p>Talk by the way , while PIPPA is passing from the hillside to Orcana . Foreign Students of painting and sculpture , from Venice , assembled opposite the house of JULES , a young French statuary , at Possagno .</p>
   <p>1st Student . Attention ! My own post is beneath this window , but the pomegranate clump yonder will hide three or four of you with a little squeezing , and Schramm and his pipe must lie flat in the balcony . Four , five — who 's a defaulter ? We want everybody , for Jules must not be 5 suffered to hurt his bride when the jest 's found out .</p>
   <p>2nd Student . All here ! Only our poet 's away — never having much meant to be present , moonstrike him ! The airs of that fellow , that Giovacchino ! He was in violent love with himself , and had a fair prospect of thriving in 10 his suit , so unmolested was it — when suddenly a woman falls in love with him , too ; and out of pure jealousy he takes himself off to Trieste , immortal poem and all — whereto is this prophetical epitaph appended already , as Bluphocks assures me — “ Here a mammoth-poem lies , 15 Fouled to death by butterflies . ” His own fault , the simpleton ! Instead of cramp couplets , each like a knife in your entrails , he should write , says Bluphocks , both classically and intelligibly .— Æsculapius , an Epic . Catalogue of the drugs : Hebe 's plaister — One strip Cools 20 your lip . Phoebus 's emulsion — One bottle Clears your throttle . Mercury 's bolus — One box Cures —</p>
   <p>3rd Student . Subside , my fine fellow ! If the marriage was over by ten o'clock , Jules will certainly be here in a minute with his bride . 25</p>
   <p>2nd Student . Good !— Only , so should the poet 's muse have been universally acceptable , says Bluphocks , et canibus nostris — and Delia not better known to our literary dogs than the boy Giovacchino !</p>
   <p>1st Student . To the point now . Where 's Gottlieb , 30 the new-comer ? Oh — listen , Gottlieb , to what has called down this piece of friendly vengeance on Jules , of which we now assemble to witness the winding-up . We are all agreed , all in a tale , observe , when Jules shall burst out on us in a fury by and by : I am spokesman — the verses 35 that are to undeceive Jules bear my name of Lutwyche — but each professes himself alike insulted by this strutting stone-squarer , who came alone from Paris to Munich , and thence with a crowd of us to Venice and Possagno here , but proceeds in a day or two alone again — oh , alone 40 indubitably !— to Rome and Florence . He , forsooth , take up his portion with these dissolute , brutalized , heartless bunglers !— so he was heard to call us all : now , is Schramm brutalized , I should like to know ? Am I heartless ?</p>
   <p>Gottlieb . Why , somewhat heartless ; for , suppose Jules 45 a coxcomb as much as you choose , still , for this mere coxcombry , you will have brushed off — what do folks style it ?— the bloom of his life .</p>
   <p>Is it too late to alter ? These love-letters now , you call his — I can n't laugh at them . 50</p>
   <p>4th Student . Because you never read the sham letters of our inditing which drew forth these .</p>
   <p>Gottlieb . His discovery of the truth will be frightful .</p>
   <p>4th Student . That 's the joke . But you should have joined us at the beginning ; there 's no doubt he loves the 55 girl — loves a model he might hire by the hour !</p>
   <p>Gottlieb . See here ! “ He has been accustomed , ” he writes , “ to have Canova 's women about him , in stone , and the world 's women beside him , in flesh ; these being as much below , as those above , his soul 's aspiration ; 60 but now he is to have the reality . ” There you laugh again ! I say , you wipe off the very dew of his youth .</p>
   <p>1st Student . Schramm ! ( Take the pipe out of his mouth , somebody ! ) Will Jules lose the bloom of his youth ? 65</p>
   <p>Schramm . Nothing worth keeping is ever lost in this world : look at a blossom — it drops presently , having done its service and lasted its time ; but fruits succeed , and where would be the blossom 's place could it continue ? As well affirm that your eye is no longer in your body , 70 because its earliest favorite , whatever it may have first loved to look on , is dead and done with — as that any affection is lost to the soul when its first object , whatever happened first to satisfy it , is superseded in due course . Keep but ever looking , whether with the body 's eye or the 75 mind 's , and you will soon find something to look on ! Has a man done wondering at women ?— there follow men , dead and alive , to wonder at . Has he done wondering at men ?— there 's God to wonder at ; and the faculty of wonder may be , at the same time , old and tired enough with 80 respect to its first object , and yet young and fresh sufficiently , so far as concerns its novel one . Thus —</p>
   <p>1st Student . Put Schramm 's pipe into his mouth again ! There you see ! Well , this Jules — a wretched fribble — oh , I watched his disportings at Possagno , the other 85 day ! Canova 's gallery — you know : there he marches first resolvedly past great works by the dozen without vouchsafing an eye ; all at once he stops full at the Psiche-fanciulla — cannot pass that old acquaintance without a nod of encouragement — “ In your new place , beauty ? 90 Then behave yourself as well here as at Munich — I see you ! ” Next he posts himself deliberately before the unfinished Pietà for half an hour without moving , till up he starts of a sudden , and thrusts his very nose into — I say , into — the group ; by which gesture you are informed that 95 precisely the sole point he had not fully mastered in Canova 's practice was a certain method of using the drill in the articulation of the knee-joint — and that , likewise , has he mastered at length ! Good-by , therefore , to poor Canova — whose gallery no longer needs detain his successor 100 Jules , the predestinated novel thinker in marble !</p>
   <p>5th Student . Tell him about the women ; go on to the women !</p>
   <p>1st Student . Why , on that matter he could never be supercilious enough . How should we be other ( he said ) 105 than the poor devils you see , with those debasing habits we cherish ? He was not to wallow in that mire , at least ; he would wait , and love only at the proper time , and meanwhile put up with the Psiche-fanciulla . Now , I happened to hear of a young Greek — real Greek girl at 110 Malamocco ; a true Islander , do you see , with Alciphron 's “ hair like sea-moss ” — Schramm knows !— white and quiet as an apparition , and fourteen years old at farthest — a daughter of Natalia , so she swears — that hag Natalia , who helps us to models at three lire an hour . We selected 115 this girl for the heroine of our jest . So first , Jules received a scented letter — somebody had seen his Tydeus at the Academy , and my picture was nothing to it : a profound admirer bade him persevere — would make herself known to him ere long . ( Paolina , my little friend of the Fenice , 120 transcribes divinely . ) And in due time , the mysterious correspondent gave certain hints of her peculiar charms — the pale cheeks , the black hair — whatever , in short , had struck us in our Malamocco model : we retained her name , too — Phene , which is , by interpretation , sea-eagle . Now , 125 think of Jules finding himself distinguished from the herd of us by such a creature ! In his very first answer he proposed marrying his monitress : and fancy us over these letters , two , three times a day , to receive and dispatch ! I concocted the main of it : relations were in 130 the way — secrecy must be observed — in fine , would he wed her on trust , and only speak to her when they were indissolubly united ? St — st — Here they come !</p>
   <p>6th Student . Both of them ! Heaven 's love , speak softly , speak within yourselves ! 135</p>
   <p>5th Student . Look at the bridegroom ! Half his hair in storm and half in calm — patted down over the left temple — like a frothy cup one blows on to cool it ! and the same old blouse that he murders the marble in !</p>
   <p>2nd Student . Not a rich vest like yours , Hannibal 140 Scratchy !— rich , that your face may the better set it off .</p>
   <p>6th Student . And the bride ! Yes , sure enough , our Phene ! Should you have known her in her clothes ? How magnificently pale !</p>
   <p>Gottlieb . She does not also take it for earnest , I 145 hope ?</p>
   <p>1st Student . Oh , Natalia 's concern , that is ! We settle with Natalia .</p>
   <p>6th Student . She does not speak — has evidently let out no word . The only thing is , will she equally remember 150 the rest of her lesson , and repeat correctly all those verses which are to break the secret to Jules ?</p>
   <p>Gottlieb . How he gazes on her ! Pity — pity !</p>
   <p>1st Student . They go in ; now , silence ! You three — not nearer the window , mind , than that pomegranate — just 155 where the little girl , who a few minutes ago passed us singing , is seated !</p>

   <p>Bluphocks . So , that is your Pippa , the little girl who passed us singing ? Well , your Bishop 's Intendant 's money shall be honestly earned :— now , do n't make me that sour face because I bring the Bishop 's name into the business ; we know he can have nothing to do with such 5 horrors ; we know that he is a saint and all that a bishop should be , who is a great man beside . Oh , were but every worm a maggot , Every fly a grig , Every bough a Christmas faggot , Every tune a jig ! In fact , I have abjured all religions ; but the last I inclined to was the Armenian : for 10 I have traveled , do you see , and at Koenigsberg , Prussia Improper ( so styled because there 's a sort of bleak hungry sun there ) , you might remark over a venerable house-porch a certain Chaldee inscription ; and brief as it is , a mere glance at it used absolutely to change the mood of 15 every bearded passenger . In they turned , one and all ; the young and lightsome , with no irreverent pause , the aged and decrepit , with a sensible alacrity : ‘ twas the Grand Rabbi 's abode , in short . Struck with curiosity , I lost no time in learning Syriac — ( these are vowels , you dogs — follow 20 my stick 's end in the mud — Celarent , Darii , Ferio ! ) and one morning presented myself , spelling-book in hand , a , b , c — I picked it out letter by letter , and what was the purport of this miraculous posy ? Some cherished legend of the past , you 'll say — “ How Moses hocus-pocussed 25 Egypt 's land with fly and locust ” — or , “ How to Jonah sounded harshish , Get thee up and go to Tarshish ” — or , “ How the angel meeting Balaam , Straight his ass returned a salaam . ” In no wise ! “ Shackabrack — Boach — somebody or other — Isaach , Re-cei-ver , Pur-cha-ser , and 30 Ex-chan-ger of — Stolen Goods ! ” So , talk to me of the religion of a bishop ! I have renounced all bishops save Bishop Beveridge — mean to live so — and die — As some Greek dog-sage , dead and merry , Hellward bound in Charon 's wherry with food for both worlds , under and 35 upper , Lupine-seed and Hecate 's supper , and never an obolus .

   <p>2nd Policeman . Old Luca Gaddi 's , that owns the silk-mills 45 here : he dozes by the hour , wakes up , sighs deeply , says he should like to be Prince Metternich , and then dozes again , after having bidden young Sebald , the foreigner , set his wife to playing draughts . Never molest such a household ; they mean well . 50</p>
   <p>Bluphocks . Only , cannot you tell me something of this little Pippa I must have to do with ? One could make something of that name . Pippa — that is , short for Felippa — rhyming to Panurge consults Hertrippa — Believest thou , King Agrippa ? Something might be done 55 with that name .</p>
   <p>2nd Policeman . Put into rhyme that your head and a ripe muskmelon would not be dear at half a zwanziger ! Leave this fooling , and look out ; the afternoon ‘ s over or nearly so . 60</p>
   <p>3rd Policeman . Where in this passport of Signor Luigi does our Principal instruct you to watch him so narrowly ? There ? What 's there beside a simple signature ? ( That English fool 's busy watching . )</p>
   <p>2nd Policeman . Flourish all round — “ Put all possible 65 obstacles in his way ” ; oblong dot at the end — “ Detain him till further advices reach you ” ; scratch at bottom — “ Send him back on pretense of some informality in the above ” ; ink-spirt on right-hand side ( which is the case here ) — “ Arrest him at once . ” Why and wherefore , I 70 do n't concern myself , but my instructions amount to this : if Signor Luigi leaves home tonight for Vienna — well and good , the passport deposed with us for our visa is really for his own use , they have misinformed the Office , and he means well ; but let him stay over tonight — there 75 has been the pretense we suspect , the accounts of his corresponding and holding intelligence with the Carbonari are correct , we arrest him at once , tomorrow comes Venice , and presently Spielberg . Bluphocks makes the signal , sure enough ! That is he , entering the 80 turret with his mother , no doubt .</p>

    <head>IV .— NIGHT</head>
     <l n="1">SCENE .— Inside the Palace by the Duomo . MONSIGNOR , dismissing his</l>
     <l n="2">Attendants .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Monsignor . Thanks , friends , many thanks ! I chiefly desire life now , that I may recompense every one of you . Most I know something of already . What , a repast prepared ? Benedicto benedicatur — ugh , ugh ! Where was I ? Oh , as you were remarking , Ugo , the weather is 5 mild , very unlike winter weather ; but I am a Sicilian , you know , and shiver in your Julys here . To be sure , when ‘ twas full summer at Messina , as we priests used to cross in procession the great square on Assumption Day , you might see our thickest yellow tapers twist suddenly in 10 two , each like a falling star , or sink down on themselves in a gore of wax . But go , my friends , but go ! [ To the Intendant . ] Not you , Ugo ! [ The others leave the apartment . ] I have long wanted to converse with you , Ugo .</p>
   <p>Intendant . Uguccio — 15</p>
   <p>Monsignor . ... ‘ guccio Stefani , man ! of Ascoli , Fermo and Fossombruno — what I do need instructing about are these accounts of your administration of my poor brother 's affairs . Ugh ! I shall never get through a third part of your accounts ; take some of these dainties 20 before we attempt it , however . Are you bashful to that degree ? For me , a crust and water suffice .</p>
   <p>Intendant . Do you choose this especial night to question me ?</p>
   <p>Monsignor . This night , Ugo . You have managed my 25 late brother 's affairs since the death of our elder brother — fourteen years and a month , all but three days . On the Third of December , I find him —</p>
   <p>Intendant . If you have so intimate an acquaintance with your brother 's affairs , you will be tender of turning 30 so far back : they will hardly bear looking into , so far back .</p>
   <p>Monsignor . Aye , aye , ugh , ugh — nothing but disappointments here below ! I remark a considerable payment made to yourself on this Third of December . Talk of disappointments ! There was a young fellow here , 35 Jules , a foreign sculptor I did my utmost to advance , that the Church might be a gainer by us both ; he was going on hopefully enough , and of a sudden he notifies to me some marvelous change that has happened in his notions of Art . Here 's his letter : “ He never had a clearly conceived 40 Ideal within his brain till today . Yet since his hand could manage a chisel , he has practiced expressing other men 's Ideals ; and , in the very perfection he has attained to , he foresees an ultimate failure : his unconscious hand will pursue its prescribed course of old years , and will 45 reproduce with a fatal expertness the ancient types , let the novel one appear never so palpably to his spirit . There is but one method of escape : confiding the virgin type to as chaste a hand , he will turn painter instead of sculptor , and paint , not carve , its characteristics ” — strike out , I 50 dare say , a school like Correggio : how think you , Ugo ?</p>
   <p>Intendant . Is Correggio a painter ?</p>
   <p>Monsignor . Foolish Jules ! and yet , after all , why foolish ? He may — probably will — fail egregiously ; but if there should arise a new painter , will it not be in some 55 such way , by a poet now , or a musician ( spirits who have conceived and perfected an Ideal through some other channel ) , transferring it to this , and escaping our conventional roads by pure ignorance of them ; eh , Ugo ? If you have no appetite , talk at least , Ugo ! 60</p>
   <p>Intendant . Sir , I can submit no longer to this course of yours . First , you select the group of which I formed one — next you thin it gradually — always retaining me with your smile — and so do you proceed till you have fairly got me alone with you between four stone walls . 65 And now then ? Let this farce , this chatter , end now ; what is it you want with me ?</p>
   <p>Monsignor . Ugo !</p>
   <p>Intendant . From the instant you arrived , I felt your smile on me as you questioned me about this and the 70 other article in those papers — why your brother should have given me this villa , that podere — and your nod at the end meant — what ?</p>
   <p>Monsignor . Possibly that I wished for no loud talk here . If once you set me coughing , Ugo !— 75</p>
   <p>Intendant . I have your brother 's hand and seal to all I possess : now ask me what for ! what service I did him — ask me !</p>
   <p>Monsignor . I would better not : I should rip up old disgraces , let out my poor brother 's weaknesses . By the 80 way , Maffeo of Forli ( which , I forgot to observe , is your true name ) , was the interdict ever taken off you , for robbing that church at Cesena ?</p>
   <p>Intendant . No , nor needs be ; for when I murdered your brother 's friend , Pasquale , for him — 85</p>
   <p>Monsignor . Ah , he employed you in that business , did he ? Well , I must let you keep , as you say , this villa and that podere , for fear the world should find out my relations were of so indifferent a stamp ? Maffeo , my family is the oldest in Messina , and century after century 90 have my progenitors gone on polluting themselves with every wickedness under heaven : my own father — rest his soul !— I have , I know , a chapel to support that it may rest ; my dear two dead brothers were — what you know tolerably well ; I , the youngest , might have rivaled them 95 in vice , if not in wealth : but from my boyhood I came out from among them , and so am not partaker of their plagues . My glory springs from another source ; or if from this , by contrast only — for I , the bishop , am the brother of your employers , Ugo . I hope to repair some 100 of their wrong , however ; so far as my brother 's ill-gotten treasure reverts to me , I can stop the consequences of his crime — and not one soldo shall escape me . Maffeo , the sword we quiet men spurn away , you shrewd knaves pick up and commit murders with ; what opportunities 105 the virtuous forego , the villainous seize . Because , to pleasure myself , apart from other considerations , my food would be millet-cake , my dress sackcloth , and my couch straw — am I therefore to let you , the offscouring of the earth , seduce the poor and ignorant by appropriating 110 a pomp these will be sure to think lessens the abominations so unaccountably and exclusively associated with it ? Must I let villas and poderi go to you , a murderer and thief , that you may beget by means of them other murderers and thieves ? No — if my cough would but 115 allow me to speak !</p>
   <p>Intendant . What am I to expect ? You are going to punish me ?</p>
   <p>Monsignor . Must punish you , Maffeo . I cannot afford to cast away a chance . I have whole centuries of sin to redeem , and only a month or two of life to do it in . 120 How should I dare to say —</p>
   <p>Intendant . “ Forgive us our trespasses ” ?</p>
   <p>Monsignor . My friend , it is because I avow myself a very worm , sinful beyond measure , that I reject a line of conduct you would applaud perhaps . Shall I proceed , 125 as it were , a-pardoning ?— I ?— who have no symptom of reason to assume that aught less than my strenuousest efforts will keep myself out of mortal sin , much less keep others out . No : I do trespass , but will not double that by allowing you to trespass . 130</p>
   <p>Intendant . And suppose the villas are not your brother 's to give , nor yours to take ? Oh , you are hasty enough just now !</p>
   <p>Monsignor . 1 , 2 — No . 3 !— aye , can you read the substance of a letter , No . 3 , I have received from Rome ? It 135 is precisely on the ground there mentioned , of the suspicion I have that a certain child of my late elder brother , who would have succeeded to his estates , was murdered in infancy by you , Maffeo , at the instigation of my late younger brother — that the Pontiff enjoins on me not 140 merely the bringing that Maffeo to condign punishment , but the taking all pains , as guardian of the infant 's heritage for the Church , to recover it parcel by parcel , howsoever , whensoever , and wheresoever . While you are now gnawing those fingers , the police are engaged in sealing 145 up your papers , Maffeo , and the mere raising my voice brings my people from the next room to dispose of yourself . But I want you to confess quietly , and save me raising my voice . Why , man , do I not know the old story ? The heir between the succeeding heir , and this heir 's 150 ruffianly instrument , and their complot 's effect , and the life of fear and bribes and ominous smiling silence ? Did you throttle or stab my brother 's infant ? Come now !</p>
   <p>Intendant . So old a story , and tell it no better ? When did such an instrument ever produce such an 155 effect ? Either the child smiles in his face , or , most likely , he is not fool enough to put himself in the employer 's power so thoroughly ; the child is always ready to produce — as you say — howsoever , wheresoever , and whensoever .</p>
   <p>Monsignor . Liar ! 160</p>
   <p>Intendant . Strike me ? Ah , so might a father chastise ! I shall sleep soundly tonight at least , though the gallows await me tomorrow ; for what a life did I lead ! Carlo of Cesena reminds me of his connivance , every time I pay his annuity ; which happens commonly thrice a year . If I 165 remonstrate , he will confess all to the good bishop — you !</p>
   <p>Monsignor . I see through the trick , caitiff ! I would you spoke truth for once . All shall be sifted , however — seven times sifted .</p>
   <p>Intendant . And how my absurd riches encumbered 170 me ! I dared not lay claim to above half my possessions . Let me but once unbosom myself , glorify Heaven , and die !</p>
   <p>Sir , you are no brutal , dastardly idiot like your brother I frightened to death : let us understand one another . Sir , I will make away with her for you — the girl — here close 175 at hand ; not the stupid obvious kind of killing ; do not speak — know nothing of her nor of me ! I see her every day — saw her this morning . Of course there is to be no killing ; but at Rome the courtesans perish off every three years , and I can entice her thither — have indeed begun 180 operations already . There 's a certain lusty , blue-eyed , florid-complexioned English knave I and the Police employ occasionally . You assent , I perceive — no , that 's not it — assent I do not say — but you will let me convert my present havings and holdings into cash , and give me time 185 to cross the Alps ? Tis but a little black-eyed , pretty singing Felippa , gay , silk-winding girl . I have kept her out of harm 's way up to this present ; for I always intended to make your life a plague to you with her . ‘ Tis as well settled once and forever . Some women I have 190 procured will pass Bluphocks , my handsome scoundrel , off for somebody ; and once Pippa entangled !— you conceive ? Through her singing ? Is it a bargain ?</p>
   <p>[ From without is heard the voice of PIPPA , singing .</p>

   <p>NOTES</p>
   <p>SONGS FROM PARACELSUS</p>
   <p>The poem Paracelsus is divided into five parts , each of which describes an important period in the experience of Paracelsus , the celebrated German-Swiss physician , alchemist , and philosopher of the sixteenth century . Book I tells of the eagerness and pride with which he set out in his youth to compass all knowledge ; he believed himself commissioned of God to learn Truth and to give it to mankind . Books II and III show him followed and idolized by multitudes to whom he imparts the fragments of knowledge he has gained . But though these fragments seem to his disciples the sum and substance of wisdom , his own mind is preoccupied with a desolating certainty that he has hardly touched on the outer confines of truth . In Book IV , after experiencing the ingratitude of his fickle adherents , he is represented as abjuring the dreams of his youth . At this point comes the first of the three songs given in the text . He builds an imaginary altar on which he offers up the aspirations , the hopes , the plans , with which he had begun his career .</p>
   <p>SONG I</p>
   <p>1-3 . Cassia is an unidentified fragrant plant ; the wood of the sandal tree is also fragrant ; labdanum or ladanum , is a resinous gum of dark color and pungent odor , exuding from various species of the cistus , a plant found around the Mediterranean ; aloe-balls are made from a bitter resinous juice extracted from the leaves of aloe-plants ; nard is an ointment made from an aromatic plant and used in the East Indies . These substances have long been traditionally associated in literature . In Psalms xlv , 8 we read : “ All thy garments smell of myrrh , and aloes , and cassia , out of the ivory palaces , whereby they have made thee glad . ” Milton in Paradise Lost , v , 293 , speaks of “ flowering odors , cassia , nard , and balms . ”</p>
   <p>4 . Such balsam . The meaning of II . 4-8 is obscure . “ Sea-side mountain pedestals ” are presumably cliffs . In the tops of the trees on these cliffs the wind , weary of its rough work on the ocean , has gently dropped the fragrant things it has swept up from the island .</p>
   <p>9-16 . In this stanza the faint sweetness from the spices used in embalming , and the perfume still clinging to the tapestry in an ancient royal room carry suggestions of vanished power and beauty that add an appropriate pathos to the richly piled altar on which Paracelsus is to offer up the “ lovely fancies ” of his youth . “ Shredded ” is a transferred epithet , referring really to “ arras , ” but transferred to the perfume of the arras .</p>
   <p>SONG II . ( Book IV )</p>
   <p>When Paracelsus confesses the failure of his pursuit of absolute knowledge , his friend Festus urges him to redeem the past by making new use of what he has gained ; but Paracelsus has no courage to attempt a reorganization of his life in accordance with a new ideal . His answer to Festus is the second of the three songs . He afterwards calls it ,</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ The sad rhyme of the men who proudly clung</l>
     <l n="2">To their first fault and withered in their pride . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">The song is a beautiful and clear allegory , vivid in its pictures , rapid</l>
     <l n="4">and musical .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="5">SONG III . ( Book V )</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>In Book V Paracelsus is described as lying ill in the Hospital of St. Sebastian . Festus is endeavoring to divert the current of his dying friend 's fierce , delirious thoughts into a gentler channel . He brings up one picture after another of the early happy life of Paracelsus , and dwells on the grandeur of his mind and achievements , and on the fame that shall be his . But the desired peace comes only when Festus sings the song of the river Mayne beside which their youth had been spent . At the end of the song Paracelsus exclaims ,</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ My heart ! they loose my heart , those simple words ;</l>
     <l n="2">Its darkness passes which naught else could touch . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The Mayne , or Main , is the most important of the right-hand tributaries of the Rhine . Wurzburg , where Festus and Paracelsus had been as students , is on its banks . Its University was especially noted for its medical department . Mr. Stopford Brooke ( The Poetry of Robert Browning , p. 99 ) says of this lovely lyric : “ I have driven through that gracious country of low hill and dale and wide water-meadows , where under flowered banks only a foot high the slow river winds in gentleness ; and this poem is steeped in the sentiment of the scenery . But , as before , Browning quickly slides away from the beauty of inanimate nature into a record of the animals that haunt the streams . He could not get on long with mountains and rivers alone . He must people them with breathing , feeling things ; anything for life ! ”</p>

   <p>THE LOST LEADER</p>
   <p>This poem indignantly records a poet 's defection from the cause of progress and liberty . Who this poet might be was for some time a matter of conjecture . Wordsworth , Southey , and Charles Kingsley , all of whom had gone from radicalism in their youth to conservatism in their old age , were severally proposed as the original of Browning 's portrait . The poem was published in 1845 , two years after Wordsworth was made poet laureate . Early in 1845 Wordsworth was presented at court , a proceeding which aroused comment — sometimes amused , sometimes indignant — from those who recalled the poet 's early scorn of rank and titles . Browning and Miss Barrett exchanged several gay letters on this subject in May , 1845 . In commenting on a letter from Miss Martineau describing Wordsworth in his home in 1846 , Browning wrote , “ Did not Shelley say long ago , ‘ He had no more imagination than a pint-pot ’ — though in those days he used to walk about France and Flanders like a man . Now , he is ‘ most comfortable in his worldly affairs ’ and just this comes of it ! He lives the best twenty years of his life after the way of his own heart — and when one presses in to see the result of his rare experiment — what the one alchemist whom fortune has allowed to get all his coveted materials and set to work at last with fire and melting pot — what he produces after all the talk of him and the like of him ; why , you get pulvis et cinis — a man at the mercy of the tongs and shovel . ” In later life , however , Browning spoke of Wordsworth in a different tone . In a letter to Mr. Grosart , written Feb. 24 , 1875 , he said , “ I have been asked the question you now address me with , and as duly answered , I can n't remember how many times . There is no sort of objection to one more assurance , or rather confession , on my part , that I did in my hasty youth presume to use the great and venerated personality of Wordsworth as a sort of painter 's model ; one from which this or the other particular feature may be selected and turned to account . Had I intended more — above all such a boldness as portraying the entire man — I should not have talked about ‘ handfuls of silver and bits of ribbon . ’ These never influenced the change of politics in the great poet — whose defection , nevertheless , accompanied as it was by a regular face-about of his special party , was , to my private apprehension , and even mature consideration , an event to deplore . But , just as in the tapestry on my wall I can recognize figures which have struck out a fancy , on occasion , that though truly enough thus derived , yet would be preposterous as a copy ; so , though I dare not deny the original of my little poem , I altogether refuse to have it considered as the ‘ very effigies ’ of such a moral and intellectual superiority . ” For an interesting parallelism in theme , see Whittier 's “ Ichabod . ”</p>
   <p>20 . Whom . The reference is to the lower classes , whom the Liberals were endeavoring to rouse to aspiration and action . The Conservatives opposed such beginnings of independence .</p>
   <p>29 . Best fight on well . It is the deserting leader who is exhorted to fight well . Though it is pain to have him desert their party , they have gloried in his power and it would be an even greater pain to see him weak . They wish him to fight well even though their cause is thereby menaced .</p>

    <head>HOW THEY BROUGHT THE GOOD NEWS FROM GHENT TO AIX</head>
    <head>This poem was written during Mr. Browning 's first journey to Italy , in 1838 . He sailed from London in a merchant vessel bound for Trieste , on which he found himself the only passenger . The weather was stormy and for the first fortnight Browning was extremely ill. As they passed through the straights of Gibraltar the captain supported him upon deck that he might not lose the sight . Of the Composition of the poem he says , “ I wrote it under the bulwark of a vessel off the African coast , after I had been at sea long enough to appreciate even the fancy of a gallop on the back of a certain good horse ‘ York ’ there in my stable at home . ” The poem was written in pencil on the flyleaf of Bartoli 's Simboli , a favorite book of his . Browning says that there was no sort of historical foundation for the story , but the Pacification of Ghent in 1576 has been suggested as an appropriate background . The incident narrated could naturally belong to the efforts of the united cities of Holland , Zealand , and the Southern Netherlands to combat the tyranny of Philip II .</head>
     <l n="1">6 . Of this line Miss Barrett wrote : “ It drew us out into the night as</l>

The first horse gave out at Hasselt , about eighty miles from Ghent ; the second horse failed at Dalhem in sight of Aix . Roland made the whole distance between midnight of one day and sunset of the next . The minute notes of time are for dramatic and picturesque effect rather than as exact indications of progress . Even the towns are not used with the exactness of a guide-book , for Looz and Tongres are off the direct route .</p>

    <head>THE FLOWER 'S NAME</head>
    <head>This poem and “ Sibrandus Schafnaburgensis , ” a companion poem , appeared in Hood 's Magazine , July , 1844 , under the title of “ Garden Fancies . ” “ The Flower 's Name ” is a description of a garden by a lover whose conception of its beauty is heightened and made vital by the memories it enshrines . Of this poem Miss Barrett wrote to Browning , “ Then the ‘ Garden Fancies ’ — some of the stanzas about the name of the flower , with such exquisite music in them , and grace of every kind — and with that beautiful and musical use of the word ‘ meandering , ’ which I never remember having seen used in relation to sound before . It does to mate with your ‘ simmering quiet ’ in Sordello , which brings the summer air into the room as sure as you read it . ” ( Letters of R. B. and E. B . B ., I , 134 . )</head>

   <p>MEETING AT NIGHT AND PARTING AT MORNING</p>
   <p>These poems were published originally simply as “ Night ” and “ Morning . ” The second of these love lyrics is somewhat difficult to interpret . If the man is speaking , the “ him ” in l. 3 must refer to the sun . In any case , after the isolation with the woman he loved as described in the first poem , there comes with the morning a sense of the world of action to which the man must return . The two poems are fully discussed in Poet-Lore , Volume VII , April , May , June-July . The poems are noteworthy for the fusion of human emotion and natural scenery and for the startlingly specific phrasing of the first quatrain .</p>
   <p>EVELYN HOPE</p>
   <p>In this lyric are embodied Browning 's faith in personal immortality , his belief in the permanence of true love and in the value of love though unrequited in this world .</p>
   <p>34 . What meant . From this point on through line 52 the lover repeats what he shall say to Evelyn Hope when in the life to come he claims her .</p>
   <p>LOVE AMONG THE RUINS</p>
   <p>A man is on his way across the fields to a turret where he is to meet the girl he loves . As he walks through the solitary pastures he mentally recreates the powerful life and varied interests of the city which , tradition has it , once occupied this site , and he seems to be absorbed in a melancholy recognition of the evanescence of human glory . The girl is not mentioned till stanza 5 . Does the emphasis on the scenery and its historic associations unduly minimize the love element of the poem ? Or is the whole picture of vanished joy and woe , pride and defeat , but a background against which stands out more clearly the rapture of the meeting in the ruined turret ?</p>
   <p>80 . Earth 's returns . This phrase refers to the ruins which are all that now remains of the centuries of folly , noise , and sin . “ Them ” in l. 81 refers apparently to the “ fighters ” and the others of the first part of the stanza .</p>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>UP AT A VILLA — DOWN IN THE CITY</head>
    <head>“ It is an admirable piece of work crowded with keen descriptions of Nature in the Casentino , and of life in the streets of Florence . And every piece of description is so filled with the character of the ‘ Italian person of quality ’ who describes them — a petulant , humorous , easily angered , happy , observant , ignorant , poor gentleman — that Browning entirely disappears . The poem retains for us in its verse , and indeed in its light rhythm , the childlikeness , the naïveté , the simple pleasures , the ignorance and the honest boredom with the solitudes of Nature — of a whole class of Italians , not only of the time when it was written , but of the present day . It is a delightful , inventive piece of gay and pictorial humor . ” ( Stopford Brooke , The Poetry of Browning , p . 322 . )</head>
     <l n="1">33 . Corn . In Great Britain the word is generally applied to wheat ,</l>
     <l n="2">rye , oats , and barley , not to maize as in America .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>34 . Stinking hemp . In Chapter I of James Lane Allen 's The Reign of Law is the following passage on the odor of the hemp-field : “ And now borne far through the steaming air floats an odor , balsamic , startling : the odor of those plumes and stalks and blossoms from which is exuding freely the narcotic resin of the great nettle . ” When the long swaths of cut hemp lies across the field , the smell is represented as strongest , “ impregnating the clothing of the men , spreading far throughout the air . ” To many this odor is essentially unpleasant .</p>
   <p>42 . Pulcinello-trumpet . Pulcinello was originally the clown in the Neapolitan comedy . Later he became the Punch in Punch and Judy shows . The trumpet announces that one of these puppet plays is to be given in the public square .</p>
   <p>43 . Scene-picture . A picture advertising the new play .</p>
   <p>44 . Liberal thieves . Members of the liberal party , the party striving for Italian independence . The Person of Quality is , of course , of the aristocratic party .</p>
   <p>47 . A sonnet . Laudatory poetical tributes with ornamental borders were posted in public places as a method of doing homage . In this case the unknown “ Reverend Don So-and-so ” is ranked by his admirer with Dante , Boccaccio , and Petrarch , the greatest Italian poets ; with St. Jerome , one of the most celebrated Fathers of the Latin Church ; with Cicero , one of the greatest of Roman orators ; and with St. Paul , the greatest of Christian preachers .</p>
   <p>51 . Our Lady . The seven swords represent symbolically the seven sorrows of the Virgin Mary , but this Person of Quality regards the gilt swords and the smart pink gowns merely as gay decorations . Religious processions of the sort described here and in lines 60-64 are frequent in European countries .</p>
   <p>55 . It 's dear . According to the system of taxation in Italy , town dues must be paid on all provisions brought into the city .</p>
   <p>60 . Yellow candles . Used at funerals and in penitential processions in the Roman Church .</p>
   <p>A TOCCATA OF GALUPPI 'S</p>
   <p>Mrs. Ireland says of this poem : “ The Toccata as a form of composition is not the measured , deliberate working-out of some central musical theme as is the Sonata or sound-piece . The Toccata , in its early and pure form , possessed no decided subject , made such by repetition , but bore rather the form of a capricious Improvisation , or ‘ Impromptu . ’ ” ( “ A Toccata of Galuppi 's ” by Mrs. Alexander Ireland , published in London Browning Society Papers . )</p>
   <p>1 . Galuppi . Baldassare Galuppi ( 1706-1784 ) was an Italian composer born near Venice . He spent many years in England and Russia . In 1768 he became organist at St. Mark 's , Venice .</p>
   <p>4 . Your old music . At the sound of the music Browning imaginatively re-creates the Venetian social life of the eighteenth century .</p>
   <p>6 . St. Mark 's . The great cathedral . The Doge of Venice used to throw a ring into the sea from the ship Bucentaur to “ denote that the Adriatic was subject to the republic of Venice as a wife is subject to her husband . ”</p>
   <p>8 . Shylock 's bridge . The Rialto , a bridge over the Grand Canal . It has two rows of shops under arcades .</p>
   <p>18 . Clavichord . An instrument with keys and strings , something like a piano .</p>
   <p>19-30 . The musical terms in these lines show Browning 's knowledge of the technicalities of the art . To one without such expert knowledge the exact musical connotation is doubtless obscure . But the epithets and phrases are in themselves sufficient to suggest the varying moods of the Venetian merrymakers . The plaintiveness , the sighs , the sense of death , the trembling hope that life may last , the renewed love-making , the new round of futile pleasures or evil deeds , the end of it all in the grave , are clearly brought forth . An elaborate explanation of the musical terms is given in the notes to the Camberwell edition of Browning 's poems .</p>
   <p>31 . But when I sit down to reason . The first thirty lines of the poem have recorded the effect of the music in re-creating in the poet 's imagination the gay , careless life of eighteenth century Venice , and its close in death . Now when the poet endeavors to turn from that picture of death lurking under smiles , he finds that the cold music has filled his mind with an inescapable sense of the futility of life , and even his own chosen mental activities seem to him , along with the rest , hardly more than dust and ashes . Ambition and enthusiasm fade before the spell of the music .</p>
   <p>OLD PICTURES IN FLORENCE</p>
   <p>3 . Aloed arch . The genus aloe includes trees , shrubs , and herbs . The American variety is the century-plant . Browning 's hill-side villa evidently had aloes trained to grow in an arch .</p>
   <p>15 . The startling bell-tower Giotto raised . Giotto began the Campanile in 1334 , and after his death in 1337 the work was continued by Andrea Pisano . Its striking beauty impresses the poet as he looks out over the city . But it does more than that , for it rouses in him reflections on the progress and meaning of art .</p>
   <p>17-24 . The address to Giotto , thrown in here as it is with conversational freedom , is partially explained in lines 184-248 . See note on l. 236 .</p>
   <p>30 . By a gift God grants me . The power to re-create vividly and minutely the past . The artists of bygone centuries are called back by his imagination to their old haunts in Florence .</p>
   <p>44 . Stands One . The “ one ” ( l. 44 ) , “ a lion ” ( l. 47 ) , “ the wronged great soul ” ( l. 48 ) , and “ the wronged great souls ” ( l. 58 ) , all refer to the unappreciated early artists .</p>
   <p>50 . They . That is , the famous great artists such as Michael Angelo and Raphael . Critics “ hum and buzz ” around them with praise to which they are indifferent .</p>
   <p>59 . Where their work is all to do . Their place in the development of art is not yet understood . It must be made clear , Browning thinks , that painters like Leonardo da Vinci ( 1452-1519 ) come in natural succession from earlier obscure artists like Dello , that art is a real and continuous record of the human mind and heart .</p>
   <p>67 . The mastiff girns . When some influential critic snarls , all the imitative inferior critics take the same tone . Cf . Shelley 's “ Adonais , ” stanzas 28 , 37 , 38 .</p>
   <p>69 . Stefano . A pupil of Giotto and called “ Nature 's ape ” because his accurate representations of the human body .</p>
   <p>72 . Vasari . Author of Lives of the Most Eminent Painters and Sculptors . ( Published 1550 . Translated by Mrs. Foster in Bohn 's Library . ) In his studies of art Browning made constant use of this book .</p>
   <p>76 . Sic transit . Sic transit gloria mundi . “ So passes away the glory of the world . ”</p>
   <p>84 . In fructu . “ As fruit . ” The fruit of Greek art at its best was that it presented in marble ideally perfect human bodies .</p>
   <p>98 . Theseus . The kingly statue of the reclining Theseus in the frieze of the Parthenon .</p>
   <p>99 . Son of Priam . In the sculptures of Æsina , Paris , the son of Priam , kneeling and drawing his bow , has a grace beyond that of any man who might think to pose as a model .</p>
   <p>101 . Apollo . At Delphi Apollo slew an enormous python .</p>
   <p>102 . Niobe . Through the vengeance of Apollo and Diana , Niobe 's seven sons and seven daughters were all slain . In the Imperial Gallery of Florence there is a statue of Niobe clasping her last child .</p>

   </lg>
   <p>113 . Growth came . New life came to art when men ceased to rest in the perfect achievement of the past , and found a new realm opened up to them in representing the subtler activities of the soul . Lines 145-152 state the ideals that actuated the new art . The reference is to the religious art of the Italian Renaissance .</p>
   <p>115-144 . These lines sum up the reasons for the importance of the art that strives “ to bring the invisible full into play ” ( l. 150 ) . It may be rough-hewn and faulty ; but it is greater and grander than Greek art because of its greater range , variety , and complexity , and because it reaches beyond any possible present perfection into eternity .</p>
   <p>134 . Thy one work ... done at a stroke . Giotto when asked for a proof of his skill to send to the Pope , drew with one stroke of his brush a perfect circle , whence the proverb , “ Rounder than the O of Giotto . ”</p>
   <p>156 . Quiddit . Quibble . The humorous rhyme “ did it — quiddit ” is but one of the many whimsical rhyming effects in the poem . The use of a light , semi-jocose form to give the greater emphasis to serious subject-matter is characteristic of Browning . Lowell in “ A Fable for Critics ” employs the same device .</p>
   <p>161-176 . Not Browning 's usual attitude . Even this poem is a deification of progress through effort , not through repose .</p>
   <p>178 . Art 's spring-birth . Nicolo the Pisan and Cimabue lived in the second half of the thirteenth century . From them to Ghiberti ( 1381-1455 ) , who made the famous bronze doors of the Baptistry at Florence , and Ghirlandajo ( 1449-1494 ) , a Florentine fresco painter , was a period in which Browning was especially interested . Mrs. Orr says that he owned pictures by all the artists mentioned here .</p>
   <p>192 . Italian quicklime . Many of the fine old Italian fresco paintings have been whitewashed over .</p>
   <p>198 . Dree . The pictures “ endure ” the doom of captivity . But they might be ferreted out if the ghosts of the old painters would only indicate where the lost works are .</p>
   <p>201-224 . He does not hope to get pictures of the famous Florentine painters , Bigordi ( probably another name for Ghirlandajo ) , Sandro , Botticelli , Lippino ( son of Fra Lippo Lippi ) , or Fra Angelico . But he might hope for better success in finding pieces by the obscure painters mentioned in lines 205-224 . These painters are so described that we know concerning each one , some characteristic quality or work .</p>
   <p>206 . Intonaco . The plaster that forms the ground for fresco work .</p>
   <p>214 . Tempera . A pigment mixed with some vehicle soluble in water instead of with oil as in oil paintings .</p>
   <p>218 . Barret . A kind of cap .</p>
   <p>230 . Zeno . The founder of the sect of Stoics , and hence supposedly not stirred by “ naked High Art . ”</p>
   <p>232 . Some clay-cold vile Carlino . Commercial dealers in art are unmoved by true beauty , but they go into ecstasies over uninspired work like that of Carlino . ( Carlo Dólci , 1616-1686 . )</p>
   <p>236 . A certain precious little tablet . Mr. Browning wrote to Professor Corson that this was a lost “ Last Supper ” praised by Vasari . The stanza in which this line occurs explains ll . 17-24 .</p>

Radetsky ( 1766-1858 ) was in 1849-1857 governor of the Austrian possessions in Upper Italy . “ The worse side of the Mont St. Gothard ” is the Swiss side . “ Morello ” is a mountain near Florence . There had been frequent insurrections against Austria , but they had been fruitless . Browning prophesies the time when there shall be a great national council ( a Witanagemot ) by which , when Freedom has been restored to Florence , a new and vigorous Art shall be brought in . It will then be perceived that a monarchy nourishes the false and monstrous in art , and that “ Pure Art ” must come from the people .</p>
   <p>258 . The stone of Dante . The stone where Dante used to draw his chair out to sit . For this and other references in stanza XXXIV see Mrs. Browning 's “ Casa Guidi Windows , ” Part I . In this poem she suggests “ a parliament of the lovers of Italy . ”</p>

   <p>“ DE GUSTIBUS — ”</p>
   <p>The whole phrase is De gustibus non disputandum — “ there is no disputing about tastes . ” Browning is writing to a friend who prefers an English landscape while the poet himself declares in favor of Italy .</p>
   <p>2 . If our loves remain . If we have a life after death .</p>
   <p>4 . A cornfield . The picture is a field of wheat with red poppies scattered through the wheat .</p>
   <p>23 . Cypress . It is interesting to note how many of the trees , shrubs , flowers , and fruits in Browning 's poems are those of southern Europe . His poetry of nature is almost as distinctively Italian as Tennyson 's is English . “ The Englishman in Italy ” is especially rich in vivid , picturesque details of southern scenes .</p>
   <p>36 . Liver-wing . The right wing . The shot hit the king in the right arm .</p>
   <p>37 . Bourbon . Mr. and Mrs. Browning were rejoicing at any indications that the people of Italy were awake to revolt against the Bourbons . See Mrs. Browning 's “ Casa Guidi Windows ” and “ First News from Villa Franca ” and Mr. Browning 's “ The Italian in England . ”</p>
   <p>40 . Queen Mary 's saying . For two hundred years Calais had been one of England 's most important possessions . It was taken by the French in 1588 , the last year of the reign of Queen Mary . What Queen Mary said of Calais , Browning says of Italy .</p>
   <p>HOME-THOUGHTS FROM ABROAD</p>
   <p>Compare the sentiment of this poem with that of “ De Gustibus — ” written ten years later . In “ Home Thoughts from Abroad ” we have one of Browning 's rare uses of the scenery of his own country .</p>
   <p>14 . That 's the wise thrush . The power of these lines in presenting both the musical and the emotional quality of the bird 's song is rivaled only by Wilson Flagg 's “ The Bobolink ” ( quoted in John Burroughs 's Birds and Poets ) and Wordsworth 's “ To the Cuckoo . ”</p>
   <p>HOME-THOUGHTS FROM THE SEA</p>
   <p>This poem and the preceding one express two phases of the poet 's love of country ; his affection for the physical beauty of England , and his pride in her political freedom . In the first poem , he turns , in thought , from the glowing color of Italy , to the more delicate loveliness of England in April ; in the second poem , he longs to repay the service his country has rendered him in defeating foreign foes .</p>
   <p>“ Home-Thoughts from the Sea ” was written at the same time and under the same circumstances as “ How they brought the Good News from Ghent to Aix . ” The poet , aboard a vessel coasting along the shore of Africa , could see to the northwest the Portuguese Cape Vincent , near which , in 1797 , England won a naval victory over Spain ; southeast of Cape Vincent , on the Spanish coast , Cadiz Bay , where , in 1796 , England defeated the second Spanish Armada ; and southeast of Cadiz Bay , Cape Trafalgar , where , in 1805 , Nelson won a famous victory over the allied fleets of France and Spain . To the northeast , the poet could see Gibraltar , the great fortress which England acquired from Spain by the Peace of Utrecht , 1713 .</p>

   <p>12 . Those lilies ... blue . Mrs. Coleridge wrote to Mr. Kenyon to know whether Mr. Browning had any authority for “ blue lilies . ” Mr. Browning answered , “ Lilies are of all colors in Palestine — one sort is particularized as white with a dark blue spot and streak — the water lily , lotus , which I think I meant , is blue altogether . ” ( Letters of R. B. and E. B . B ., i , 523 , 556 . )</p>
   <p>31 . The king-serpent . Probably the boa-constrictor . In poetry the characteristic most often attributed to a snake is malignancy . But in this picture of the serpent lying dormant and waiting for the sloughing of its old skin in the springtime , when it will come forth with new beauty and power , the idea presented is that of tremendous force temporarily in abeyance .</p>
   <p>42 . Then the tune . The boy , alone in the field , tries all sorts of experiments in musical attraction on the animals about him . Professor Albert S. Cook suggests that Browning is here indebted to the Greek pastoral romance of Daphnis and Chloe . See Smith 's translation in the Bohn edition . The passages read in part as follows : “ He ran through all variations of pastoral melody ; he played the tune which the oxen obey , and which attracts the goats — that in which the sheep delight .</p>
   <p>“ He took his pipe from his scrip , and breathed into it very gently . The goats stood still , merely lifting up their heads . Next he played the pasture tune , upon which they all put down their heads and began to graze . Now he produced some notes soft and sweet in tone ; at once his herd lay down . After this he piped in a sharp key , and they ran off to the woods as if a wolf were in sight . ” These quotations serve at least to show how old is the fancy that animals are affected by music .</p>

   <p>105 . Have ye seen , etc . The simile in lines 104-115 could have been written only by one familiar with mountain regions . Browning knew the Alps and Apennines . Did David at any time live in a mountainous country ?</p>
   <p>124 . Slow pallid sunsets . Note the character of the similitudes so far used in describing Saul . In his agony he is like the king-serpent . His rage is like the earthquake that may tear open the rock but at the same time sets the gold free . His final release from the evil spirit is described by the sudden fall of the avalanche from the mountain summit . The look in his eyes as he comes back to life , yet seeing nothing in life to desire , is compared to pale autumn sunsets seen over the ocean , or to slow sunsets seen over a desolate hill country . All the figures contribute to our impression of Saul 's power and majesty .</p>

   <p>172 . Carouse in the past . This line marks a change in the direction of David 's thought . Up to stanza X it was the glorious past that he had been urging upon Saul 's attention . But now he realizes that true inspiration comes not so much from a re-living of one 's achievements , as from the thought of the permanence of one 's fame and one 's deeds .</p>
   <p>192 . And behold while I sang . At this point David is overcome by the memory of the sudden spiritual illumination that came to him in his interview with Saul . He had reached the summit of his endeavor ( l. 191 ) and yet knew himself powerless to give the King new life . Then there flashed upon him the truth expressed in stanzas XVII-XIX . He breaks off in lines 192-205 , going , in his strong feeling , ahead of his story and commenting on what is described in stanza XIX . In stanza XV he resumes his narrative .</p>
   <p>204 . Hebron . David watches the slow coming of the dawn over the hill on which is situated the town of Hebron .</p>
   <p>205 . Kidron . A brook near Jerusalem . It is fed by springs , and the amount of water in it is sensibly decreased by the extreme heat of the day .</p>
   <p>214 . Ere error had bent . In I Samuel , Chapter xv , is an account of Saul 's disobedience and punishment . The choosing of Saul to be king is described in I Samuel , Chapters ix and x .</p>
   <p>292 . Sabaoth . The word means “ hosts ” and is ordinarily used in the phrase “ The Lord of hosts . ” It represents the omnipotence of God .</p>
   <p>303 . Nor leave up nor down , etc . At the end of stanza xv , the thought that had come to David was that God had proved supreme in all the ways in which a human being could test knowledge and power , but that in the one way of love the creature might surpass the Creator . At line 302 he has come to believe in the infinitude of God 's love as well as in the infinitude of His power . It is interesting to note that George Eliot in Silas Marner gives to ignorant Dolly Winthrop an experience and a philosophy of life almost identical with those of Browning 's David .</p>
   <p>307-312 . A prophecy of the revelation of the divine in the human , the coming of God in the person of Christ . It is the human in the divine that men seek and love . In the Old Testament days such an idea , though foretold and longed for , could be but vaguely conceived except in moments of especial insight in the minds of poet-prophets like David . Mr. Herford ( Robert Browning , p. 120 ) says of this passage :</p>
   <p>“ David is occupied with no speculative question , but with the practical problem of saving a ruined soul ; and neither logical ingenuity nor divine suggestion , but the inherent spiritual significance of the situation , urges his thought along the lonely path of prophecy . The love for the old King , which prompted him to try all the hidden paths of his soul in quest of healing , becomes a lighted torch by which he tracks out the meaning of the world and the still unrevealed purposes of God ; until the energy of thought culminates in vision and the Christ stands full before his eyes . ”</p>
   <p>313-335 . In this stanza David represents all existences , good and evil spirits , all animals , all forms of nature , as stirred by the great news of the future manifestation of the love of God as shown in Christ .</p>

   <p>TWO IN THE CAMPAGNA</p>
   <p>The Campagna , a plain around the city of Rome , was in ancient times the seat of many cities ; it is now dotted with ruins . “ There is a solemnity and beauty about the Campagna entirely its own . To the reflective mind , this ghost of old Rome is full of suggestion ; its vast , almost limitless extent as it seems to the traveler ; its abundant herbage and floral wealth in early spring ; its desolation , its crumbling monuments , and its evidences of a vanished civilization , fill the mind with a sweet sadness , which readily awakens the longing for the infinite spoken of in the poem . ” ( Berdoe , Browning Cyclopædia , p . 553 . )</p>
   <p>6 . I touched a thought . The elusive thought which he fancifully pursues from point to point in the surrounding landscape finds statement in lines 34-60 . Of these lines Sharp ( Life of Browning , p. 159 ) says , “ There is a gulf which not the profoundest search can fathom , which not the strongest-winged love can overreach : the gulf of individuality . It is those who have loved most deeply who recognize most acutely this always pathetic and often terrifying isolation of the soul . None save the weak can believe in the absolute union of two spirits ... No man , no poet assuredly , could love as Browning loved , and fail to be aware , often with vague anger and bitterness , no doubt , of this insuperable isolation even when spirit seemed to leap to spirit , in the touch of a kiss , in the evanishing sigh of some one or other exquisite moment . ”</p>
   <p>IN THREE DAYS</p>
   <p>“ Another poem of waiting love is ‘ In Three Days . ’ And this has the spirit of a true love lyric in it . It reads like a personal thing ; it breathes exaltation ; it is quick , hurried , and thrilled . The delicate fears of chance and changes in the three days , or in the years to come , belong of right and nature to the waiting , and are subtly varied and condensed . It is , however , the thoughtful love of a man who can be metaphysical in love . ” ( Stopford Brooke , The Poetry of Robert Browning , p . 253 . )</p>
   <p>THE GUARDIAN ANGEL</p>
   <p>Fano . This poem was written in the summer of 1848 after a visit of three days at Fano . It is addressed to Alfred Domett , one of Browning 's warm friends , who was at that time in New Zealand on the Wairoa River . For a vivid description of him see Browning 's “ Waring . ” The picture at Fano , the details of which are fully brought out in the poem , has been reproduced in Illustrations to Browning 's Poems , Part I , published by the Browning Society . Mrs. Browning ( Letters i , 380 ) speaks of it as “ a divine picture of Guercino 's worth going all that way to see . ”</p>

Mr. Berdoe ( Browning Cyclopædia , p. 339 ) says that the story given here is based on an account by Verstegan in his Restitution of Decayed Intelligence ( 1634 ) . Verstegan gives “ Bunting ” as the name of the piper ; the town , as Hamelin in Brunswick on the Weser ; and the mountain into which the children were led as the Köppenberg .</p>

    <head>When Mr. Browning was little more than a child he heard a woman one Guy Fawkes 's Day sing , in the street a strange song whose burden was “ Following the Queen of the Gypsies , O ! ” The singular refrain haunted his memory for many years , and out of it was ultimately born this poem .</head>

   <p>216 . Well , early in autumn . In writing “ The Flight of the Duchess ” Browning was interrupted by a friend on some important business which temporarily drove the story out of the poet 's mind . Some months after the publication of the first part in Hood 's Magazine , April , 1845 , he was staying at Bettisfield Park in Shropshire when someone in commenting on the early approach of winter said that already the deer had to break the ice in the pond . This chance phrase roused the poet 's fancy , and when he returned home he completed his poem .</p>

   <p>A GRAMMARIAN 'S FUNERAL</p>
   <p>The Revival of Learning . The Revival of Learning , or the Renaissance , began as early as the tenth century . Its period of most rapid progress was from the twelfth century to the fifteenth . One phase of the interest in the revival of learning was the effort to restore Latin to its ancient purity . The word “ grammarian ” was more widely inclusive than now , meaning one who devoted himself to general learning . Of this poem Dr. Burton in “ Renaissance Pictures in Browning ” ( Poet-Lore , Vol . x , pp . 60-76 , No . 1 , 1898 ) says : “ I know of no lyric of the poet 's more representative of his peculiar and virile strength than this , in that it makes vibrant and thoroughly emotional an apparently unemotional theme . In relation to the Renaissance , the revival of learning , the moral is the higher inspiration derived from the new wine of the classics , so that what in later times has cooled down too often to a dry-as-dust study of the husks of knowledge is shown to be , at the start , a veritable reveling in the delights of the fruit . ”</p>
   <p>Mr. Stopford Brooke in The Poetry of Browning , p. 155 , says , “ This is the artist at work , and I doubt whether all the laborious prose written , in history and criticism , on the revival of learning , will ever express better than this short poem the inexhaustible thirst of the Renaissance in its pursuit of knowledge , or the enthusiasm of the pupils of a New Scholar for his desperate strife to know in a short life the very center of the universe . ”</p>

   <p>113 . That low man . This comparison between the “ low man ” and the “ high man ” could be effectively illustrated from “ Andrea del Sarto . ” Andrea is the “ low man ” who with his skillful hand “ goes on adding one to one ” till he attains his “ hundred , ” or excellence of technique . But the other painters , the ones with the “ truer light of God ” in them , reach the heaven above and take their place there although what they see transcends the power of their art to tell . They miss the “ unit ” of an adequate technique , but they gain the “ million ” of spiritual insight .</p>

   <p>“ CHILDE ROLAND TO THE DARK TOWER CAME ”</p>
   <p>Mrs. Orr ( Handbook of Browning 's Works , p. 274 ) says of this poem : “ We can connect no idea of definite pursuit or attainment with a series of facts so dream-like and so disjointed : still less extract from it a definite moral ; and we are reduced to taking the poem as a simple work of fancy , built up of picturesque impressions which have , separately or collectively , produced themselves in the author 's mind . ” And she adds in a note : “ I may venture to state that these picturesque materials included a tower which Mr. Browning once saw in the Carrara Mountains , a painting which caught his eye years later in Paris ; and the figure of a horse in the tapestry in his own drawing-room — welded together in the remembrance of the line from ‘ King Lear , ’ which forms the heading of the poem . ” The possible allegorical signification of the poem has been the subject of much , and often of singularly futile discussion . Dr. Furnivall said he had asked Browning if it was an allegory , and in answer had on three separate occasions received an emphatic statement that it was simply a dramatic creation called forth by a line of Shakspere 's . ( Porter-Clarke , Study Programmes , p . 406 . ) Yet allegorical interpretations continue to be made . According to one line of interpretation the pilgrim is a “ truth-seeker , misdirected by the lying spirit ” ( the hoary cripple ) , and when he blows the slug-horn it is as a warning to others that he has failed in his quest , and that the way to the dark tower is the way of destruction and death . ( Berdoe , Browning Cyclopædia , p. 105 ) According to other readings of the tale the blast which the pilgrim blows at the end of his quest is one of “ spiritual victory and incitement to others . ” When the Rev . John S. Chadwick visited the poet and asked him if constancy to an ideal — “ He that endureth to the end shall be saved ” — was not a sufficient understanding of the central purpose of the poem , Browning said : “ Yes , just about that . ” With constancy to an ideal as the central purpose , the details of this poem , without being minutely interpreted , may yet serve as a representation of the depression , the hopelessness , the dullness and deadness of soul , the doubt and terror even of the man who travels the last stages of a difficult journey to a long-sought but unknown goal . His victory consists in the unfaltering persistence of his search . The “ squat tower , ” when he reaches it , is prosaic and ugly , but finding it is after all not the essential point . The essential element of his success is that , encircled by the last temptations to despair , he holds heart and brain steady , and carries out his quest to its last detail . ( See an article in The Critic , May 3 , 1886 , by Mr. Arlo Bates , in opposition to any definite allegory . Mr. Nettleship in Robert Browning [ p. 89 ] devotes a chapter to a paraphrase and an allegorical explanation . )</p>
   <p>Mr. Herford ( Life of Browning , p. 94 ) calls the poem “ a great romantic legend ” and emphasizes its intensity and boldness of invention . He compares its “ horror-world ” with that of Coleridge in “ The Ancient Mariner . ” “ What ‘ The Ancient Mariner ’ is in the poetry of the mysterious terrors and splendors of the sea , that ‘ Childe Roland ’ is in the poetry of bodeful horror , of haunted desolation , of waste and plague , ragged distortion , and rotting ugliness in landscape . The Childe , like the Mariner , advances through an atmosphere and scenery of steadily gathering menace . ”</p>
   <p>Mr. Chesterton says of the scenery : “ It is ... the poetry of the shabby and hungry aspect of the earth itself . Daring poets who wished to escape from the conventional gardens and orchards had long been in the habit of celebrating the poetry of rugged and gloomy landscapes , but Browning is not content with this . He insists on celebrating the poetry of mean landscapes . That sense of scrubbiness in nature , as of a man unshaved , had never been conveyed with this enthusiasm and primeval gusto before . ” ( Robert Browning , p . 159 . )</p>

    <head>HOW IT STRIKES A CONTEMPORARY</head>
    <head>This poem is the story of an obscure poet in the Spanish city of Valladolid . It brings out his actual life and the townfolk 's misinterpretations of it . Reports multiply upon themselves and take new meanings till the harmless poet is generally accounted the King 's spy and the real agent of all royal edicts , the town 's master , in fact . The interest which , as a poet , he takes in all manifestations of life is popularly supposed to be the alertness of a secret agent of the government . The reams of poetry he writes are transformed into letters of information to the King . Rumor translates the poet 's perfectly decent , regular , meager life into secret sybaritic extravagances .</head>

    <head>FRA LIPPO LIPPI</head>
     <l n="1">Fra Lippo Lippi was born in Florence in 1406 . See Vasari 's Lives of the</l>
     <l n="2">Painters for the account of his life on which Browning based his poem .</l>
     <l n="3">( Vasari 's account is quoted in Cooke 's Browning Guide Book . )</l>
   </lg>
   <p>2 . You need not clap your torches . Throughout this lively dramatic monologue it is important to mark every indication of the words or gestures of the auditors ; for instance , in lines 13 , 18 , 26 , etc .</p>
   <p>7 . The Carmine . Fra Lippo Lippi 's entrance into the monastery of the friars del Carmine and his education there are described later in the poem . He lived there till he was twenty-six . He had no vocation for the life of a monk and wished to devote himself to painting . He apparently left the monastery on good terms with the friars .</p>
   <p>17 . Master — a Cosimo of the Medici . Cosimo de Medici ( 1389-1464 ) was a rich Florentine banker and statesman . He was a magnificent patron of art and literature . The old Medici palace ( l. 17 ) , now known as Palazzo Riccardi , is on the corner of the Via Cavour and the Via Gori . The church of San Lorenzo ( the “ Saint Laurence ” of l. 67 ) is a short distance farther west on the Via Gori .</p>
   <p>22 . Pick up a manner . The painter protests against the rough usage to which he has been subjected .</p>
   <p>23 . Zooks . An interjection formerly written “ gadzooks . ” Pilchards are a common cheap fish of the Mediterranean and are taken in seines .</p>
   <p>28 . Quarter-florin . The florin was a gold coin of Florence . It was first struck off in the twelfth century and was called a florin because it had a flower stamped on one side .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">31 . I 'd like his face . The painter cannot look upon the crowd of men</l>
     <l n="2">about him without seeing faces he would like to draw . One man would do</l>
     <l n="3">as a model for Judas . Another would do well in a picture Fra Lippo 's</l>
     <l n="4">imagination quickly conjures up of a slave holding the head of John the</l>
     <l n="5">Baptist by the hair . In Fra Lippo 's real picture of the beheading of</l>
     <l n="6">John the Baptist the head is brought in by Salome , the daughter of</l>
     <l n="7">Herodias , on a great platter .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="8">46 . Carnival . The days preceding Lent . A period marked by much gaiety ,</l>
     <l n="9">street revelry , masking , etc .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>53 . Flower o ’ the broom . These flower songs , called stornelli , are improvised by the peasants at their work . “ The stornelli consists of three lines . The first line usually contains the name of a flower which sets the rhyme and is five syllables long . Then the love theme is told in two lines of eleven syllables each , agreeing by rhyme , assonance , or repetition with the first . ” ( Porter and Clarke note in Camberwell Edition . ) Browning does not follow the model strictly .</p>
   <p>73 . Jerome . St. Jerome was one of the Fathers of the Christian Church . During a part of his early life he was given up to worldly pleasures , and for this he did penance by living for a number of years in a cave in a desert region . The penitent St. Jerome was a popular devotional subject in early Christian art . “ The scene is generally a wild rocky solitude ; St. Jerome , half-naked , emaciated , with matted hair and beard , is seen on his knees before a crucifix , beating his breast with a stone . ” ( Mrs. Jameson , Sacred and Legendary Art , i , 308 . )</p>
   <p>80 . What am I a beast for ? If you had happened , says Fra Lippo , to catch Cosimo in a frolic like this , of course you would have said nothing ; but you think a monk is a beast if he indulges in these nocturnal pleasures . Yet why should the fact that I break monastic rules make you consider me a beast ? Just let me tell you how I happened to become a monk .</p>
   <p>83 . I starved there . Note the vivid picture of the life of a street gamin here and in lines 112-126 .</p>
   <p>88 . Aunt Lapaccia . Vasari says , “ The child was for some time under the care of a certain Mona Lapaccia , his aunt , who brought him up with very great difficulty till he had attained his eighth year , when , being no longer able to support the burden of his maintenance , she placed him in the above-named convent of the Carmelites . ” “ Trussed , ” means “ firmly seized . ”</p>
   <p>117 . Which gentlemen , etc . Gentlemen clad in fine ecclesiastical robes walk in the religious procession and carry tall wax candles or torches ; the drippings from these candles the street-urchin wishes to catch in order to sell them again , but it is against the law , and the fine gentlemen if not kindly disposed may call in the magistrates ( “ The Eight ” ) and have the boy whipped .</p>
   <p>130 . The antiphonary 's marge . He scrawled his sketches on the margins of the book used by the choir , and he made faces out of the notes , which were then square with long stems .</p>
   <p>139 . We Carmelites . The three orders of monks , the Carmelites , the Camaldolese , and the Dominicans ( called “ Preaching Brothers ” by Pope Innocent III ) owned various monasteries and churches , and were each ambitious to possess the greatest sacred paintings .</p>
   <p>145-163 . These lines describe the different figures painted on the wall by Fra Lippo when the prior bade him “ daub away . ” The monks dressed in black or white according to the garb of their orders ; the old women waiting to confess small thefts ; the row of admiring little children gazing at a bearded fellow , a murderer who , still breathing hard with the run that has brought him in safety to the altar steps , defies the “ white anger ” of his victim 's son , who has followed him into the church ; the girl who loves the brute of a murderer , and brings him flowers , food , and her earrings to aid him when he shall escape — all these are painted on the wall . Then the young artist took down the ladder by means of which he had reached the bit of cloister-wall where he had been recording his observations of life , and called the monks to see .</p>
   <p>156 . Whose sad face . The purpose of Christ 's suffering ( “ passion ” ) on the cross was to bring love into the world , but after a thousand years of his teaching his image looks down upon theft , anger , murder .</p>
   <p>172 . My triumph 's straw-fire . Lippo 's triumph was as short-lived as a fire of straw . The monks were delighted with the realism of the painting , but when the Prior and the critics came they declared that such “ homage to the perishable clay ” was a mere “ devil 's game . ” The business of the painter , they said , was to ignore the body and paint the soul .</p>
   <p>184 . Man 's soul . Note the difficulty the Prior experiences when he tries to describe the “ soul ” he wishes the artist to paint . Lines 185-186 represent an old superstition .</p>
   <p>189-198 . In contrast to the homely realism of Fra Lippo 's picture of ordinary people are the idealism , the religious symbolism , of the pictures of Giotto , a painter a century and a half earlier than Fra Lippo , and the greatest master of the early school of Italian art .</p>
   <p>198-214 . An exposition of Fra Lippo 's idea of painting . He says that it is nonsense to ignore the body in order to make the soul preëminent , that the painter should go a “ double step ” and paint both body and soul . He may make the face of a girl as lovely and life-like as possible , and at the same time show her soul in her face .</p>

   <p>276 . Guidi . Tommaso Guidi , ordinarily known as Masaccio , or Tomassacio , Slovenly or Hulking Tom . Browning followed good authority in making Masaccio a pupil of Fra Lippo Lippi , but in point of fact he was probably the master whose works Fra Lippo studied . Lübke ( History of Art ii , 207 ) says of Guidi : “ In his exceedingly short life he rapidly traversed the various stages of development of earlier art , and pressed on with a bold confidence to a greatness and power of vision which have rendered his works the characteristic ones of an epoch , and his example a decisive influence in all the art of the fifteenth century .... Almost every master in the fifteenth century ... studied these great works and learned from them . One of the first of these masters was Fra Lippo Lippi . ” The important point is that Fra Lippo and Masaccio were both pioneers in the new art which took infinite pains in the representation of the body . Masaccio is said to have been the first Italian artist to paint a nude figure .</p>
   <p>323 . A Saint Laurence ... at Prato . Prato a town near Florence , attracted many artists in the fifteenth century , so that one finds there many specimens of Early Renaissance painting . Some of the most important of Fra Lippo Lippi 's large works are in the Cathedral at Prato .</p>
   <p>326-334 . The people have been so enraged at the slaves who are pictured as assisting in the martyrdom of St. Laurence that the faces of these slaves have been scratched from the wall . The monks think the picture a huge success because it has thus roused religious zeal .</p>
   <p>339 . Chianti wine . A famous wine named from Chianti , a mountain group near Siena , Italy .</p>
   <p>346 . Sant Ambrogio 's . The picture described here is the “ Coronation of the Virgin ” now in the Accademia delle Belle Arti of Florence . Sant ’ Ambrogio is a Florentine church named after St. Ambrose , a Bishop of Milan .</p>
   <p>354 . St. John . The Baptist . Note the reference to camel 's hair raiment in l. 375 . The Battistero , the original cathedral of Florence , was dedicated to John the Baptist . Some say the reliefs on one of its famous bronze doors represent scenes from his life . To this church all children born in Florence are brought to be baptized .</p>
   <p>357 . Job . See Job i , 1 .</p>
   <p>360 . Up shall come . Artists not infrequently painted their own portraits in their pictures . In the “ Coronation of the Virgin ” Fra Lippo 's round tonsured head is seen in the lower right hand corner .</p>
   <p>377 . Iste perfecit opus . “ This one did the work . ”</p>
   <p>381 . Hot cockles . An old English game in which a blind-folded player tries to guess the names of those who touch or strike him .</p>
   <p>ANDREA DEL SARTO</p>
   <p>Andrea del Sarto 's father was a tailor ( Sarto ) and so the son was nicknamed “ The Tailor 's Andrew . ” He was born in 1486 . His first paintings were seven frescoes in the Church of the Annunziata in Florence . They were “ marvelous productions for a youth who was little over twenty , and remain Andrea 's most charming and attractive works . ” ( Julia Cartwright , The Painters of Florence . ) Algernon Charles Swinburne in Essays and Studies ( “ Notes and Designs on the Old Masters at Florence ” ) says of Andrea 's early paintings in comparison with his later work : “ These are the first fruits of his flowering manhood , when the bright and buoyant genius in him had free play and large delight in its handiwork ; when the fresh interest of invention was still his , and the dramatic sense , the pleasure in the play of life , the power of motion and variety ; before the old strength of sight and of flight had passed from weary wing and clouding eye , the old pride and energy of enjoyment had gone out of hand and heart .</p>
   <p>“ How the change fell upon him , and how it wrought , anyone may see who compares his later with his earlier work .... The time came when another than Salome [ referring to Andrea del Sarto 's picture of Salome dancing before Herod ] was to dance before the eyes of the painter ; and she required of him the head of no man , but his own soul ; and he paid the forfeit into her hands .... In Mr. Browning 's noblest poem — his noblest , it seems to me — the whole tragedy is distilled into the right words , the whole man raised up and reclothed with flesh . One point only is but lightly touched upon — missed it could not be by an eye so sharp and skillful — the effect upon his art of the poisonous solvent of love . How his life was corroded by it , and his soul burnt into dead ashes we are shown in full , but we are not shown in full what as a painter he was before , what as a painter he might have been without it . ”</p>
   <p>The bare facts of this poem are taken from Vasari 's Lives of the Painters . Vasari , once a pupil of Andrea del Sarto , hated Lucrezia and in his account spared no details of her evil influence . Later chronicles give a somewhat more favorable view of her , but the main facts of the story remain undisputed . Of the origin of the poem , Mrs. Andrew Crosse ( see “ John Kenyon and His Friends ” in Temple Bar Magazine , April , 1900 ) writes ; “ When the Brownings were living in Florence , Kenyon had begged them to procure him a copy of the portrait in the Pitti of Andrea del Sarto and his wife . Mr. Browning was unable to get the copy made with any promise of satisfaction , and so wrote the exquisite poem of Andrea del Sarto — and sent it to Kenyon ! ” For another literary presentation of Andrea del Sarto see Andre del Sarto , a play by Alfred de Musset .</p>
   <p>15 . Fiesole . A town on a hill above the Arno about three miles northwest of Florence . See Pippa Passes .</p>
   <p>40 . We are in God 's hand . Andrea 's fatalistic view of life aids him in escaping the poignancy of remorse .</p>
   <p>65 . The Legate 's talk . The representative of the Pope praised Andrea 's work . For the high esteem accorded Andrea when he was in Paris at the court of Francis I , see lines 149-161 .</p>
   <p>82 . This low-pulsed forthright craftsman 's hand . Eugene Muntz ( quoted in Masters of Art series , in the number entitled “ Andrea del Sarto ” ) says of Andrea 's skill : “ No painter has excelled him in the rendering of flesh .... No painter , moreover , has surpassed him in his grasp of the infinite resources of the palette . All the secrets of richness , softness , and morbidenza , all the mysteries of pastoso and sfumato were his . It is not then as a technician that we must deny Andrea del Sarto the right to rank with the very greatest . It is as an artist ( using the word in its highest sense ) that he falls below them , for he was lacking in the loftier qualities of imagination , sentiment , and , worst of all , conviction . ” Histoire de l'Art pendent la Renaissance .</p>
   <p>93 . Morello . A mountain of the Apennines and visible from Florence .</p>
   <p>98 . Or what 's a heaven for . According to Browning 's theory , perfection gained and rested in means stagnation . Aspiration toward the unattainable is the condition of growth . The artist who can satisfy himself with such themes as can be completely expressed by his art , is on a low level of experience and attainment .</p>
   <p>105 . The Urbinate . Raphael Sanzio of Urbino , one of the greatest of Italian painters . He died in 1520 ; hence the date of this poem is supposed to be 1525 .</p>
   <p>136 . Agnolo . Michael Agnolo ( less correctly , Angelo ) , 1475-1566 , great both as sculptor and painter .</p>
   <p>149 . Francis . Francis I of France was a patron of the arts . When Andrea was thirty-two and had been married five years , King Francis sent for him to come to Fontainebleau , the most sumptuous of the French royal palaces . Andrea greatly enjoyed the splendor and hospitality of the French court , and he was happy in his successful work , when Lucrezia called him home . He obtained a vacation of two months and took with him money with which to make purchases for the French king . This money he used to buy a house for Lucrezia .</p>

   <p>THE BISHOP ORDERS HIS TOMB AT ST. PRAXED 'S CHURCH</p>
   <p>There is an old church in Rome named in honor of St. Praxed or Praxedes . The Bishop 's Tomb , however , “ is entirely fictitious , although something which is made to stand for it is now shown to credulous sightseers . ” ( Mrs. Orr , Handbook to Robert Browning 's Works , p . 247 . )</p>
   <p>Ruskin says of this poem : “ Robert Browning is unerring in every sentence he writes of the Middle Ages — always vital , right , and profound , so that in the matter of art , with which we are specially concerned , there is hardly a principle connected with the medieval temper that he has not struck upon in these seemingly careless and too rugged lines of his .... I know no other piece of modern English prose or poetry in which there is so much told , as in these lines , of the Renaissance spirit — its worldliness , inconsistency , pride , hypocrisy , ignorance of itself , love of art , of luxury , and of good Latin . It is nearly all that I have said of the central Renaissance , in thirty pages of ‘ The Stones of Venice , ’ put into as many lines , Browning 's also being the antecedent work . ” ( Modern Painters , Vol . iv , pp . 337-9 . ) “ It was inevitable that the great period of the Renaissance should produce men of the type of the Bishop of St. Praxed ; it would be grossly unfair to set him down as the type of the churchmen of his time . ” Berdoe , Browning Cyclopædia , p. 81 .</p>
   <p>1 . Vanity , saith the preacher , vanity . Cf . ll . 8-9 , 51-52 , as illustrative of the religious professionalism of the Bishop 's talk . He drops into the ecclesiastical conception of life and death , and into the phraseology of his order .</p>
   <p>21 . Epistle-side . The right-hand side facing the altar , where the epistle is read by the priest acting as celebrant , the gospel being read from the other side by the priest acting as assistant .</p>
   <p>29 . Peach-blossom marble . This rosy marble delights the Bishop as much as the pale cheap onion-stone offends him . The lapis-lazuli , a rich blue stone ( l. 42 ) , the antique-black ( Nero-antico ) , a rare black marble ( l. 34 ) , the beautiful green jasper ( l. 68 ) , the elaborate carving planned for the bronze frieze ( l. 56-62 , 106-111 ) , show not only that the Bishop covets what is costly , but that his highly cultivated taste knows real beauty .</p>
   <p>34 . That conflagration . The eagerness of the Bishop for the lump of the lapis-lazuli has made him steal even from his own church .</p>
   <p>41 . Olive-frail . A basket made of rushes , used for packing olives .</p>
   <p>57 . Those Pans and Nymphs . The underlying paganism of the Bishop produces a strangely incongruous mixture on his tomb — the Savior , St. Praxed , Moses , Pan , and the Nymphs .</p>
   <p>58 . Thyrsus . The ivy-coiled staff or spear stuck in a pine-cone , symbol of the Bacchic orgy .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">68 . Travertine . A white limestone , the name being a corruption of</l>
     <l n="2">Tiburninus , from Tibur , now Tivoli , near Rome , whence this stone comes .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>77 . Choice Latin . The Bishop 's scholarship was as good as his taste in marbles . The Elucescebat ( “ he was illustrious ” ) of l. 99 Browning called “ dog-latin ” and he called “ Ulpian , the golden jurist , a copper latinist . ” ( See letter to D. G. Rossetti . Quoted by A. J. George , Select Poems of Browning , p . 366 . ) Tully 's Latin was Cicero 's ( Marcus Tullius Cicero ) , the purest classic style . The Grammarian in “ The Grammarian 's Funeral ” was equally intense on a point of elegance or correctness in the ancient languages .</p>
   <p>80-84 . The Bishop rejoices in all that has to do with the forms and ceremonies of the church . Note in ll . 119-121 his insistence on form and order .</p>
   <p>91 . Strange thoughts . From this point on the Bishop 's mind seems to wander .</p>
   <p>108 . A visor and a Term . The visor is a mask . A term is any bust or half-statue not placed upon but incorporated with , and as it were immediately springing out of , the square pillar which serves as its pedestal .</p>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>CLEON</head>
    <head>The quotation preceding this poem is from Acts xvii , 28 , and is , in full , “ As certain also of your own poets have said , ‘ For we are also his offspring . ’ ” The poet thus referred to by Paul was Aratus , a Greek poet from Tarsus , Paul 's own city . The Cleon and Protus of Browning 's poem are not historical characters , but they are representative of the tone of thought and inquiry on the part of the Greek philosophers at the time of Paul . Lines 1-158 give an account of the achievements of Cleon , a man who has attained eminence in the various realms of poetry , philosophy , painting , and sculpture . He is not in any one accomplishment equal to the great poets , musicians , or artists of the past , and yet he represents progress because he is able to enter into sympathy with the great achievements in all these realms .</head>
     <l n="1">1 . Sprinkled isles . Presumably the Sporades , the “ scattered isles . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>4 . Profits in his Tyranny . Free government [ in Greece ] having superseded the old hereditary sovereignties , all who obtained absolute power in a state were called tyrants , or rather despots ; for the term indicates the irregular way in which the power was given rather than the way in which it was exercised . Tyrants might be mild in exercise of authority , and , like Protus , liberal in their patronage of the arts .</p>
   <p>8 . Gift after gift . Protus , a patron of the arts , shows his appreciation of the work of Cleon by many royal gifts . Chief among the slaves , black and white , sent by Protus , is one white woman in a bright yellow wool robe , who is especially commissioned to present a beautiful cup . Lines 136-8 are also descriptive of this girl .</p>
   <p>41 . Zeus . The chief of the Grecian gods .</p>
   <p>47 . That epos . An epic poem by Cleon engraved on golden plates .</p>
   <p>51 . The image of the sun-god on the phare . Cleon has made a statue of Apollo for a lighthouse . Phare is from the island of Pharos where there was a famous lighthouse .</p>
   <p>53 . The Poecile . The Portico of Athens painted with battle pictures by Polygnotus .</p>
   <p>69 . For music . “ In Greek music the scales were called moods or modes and were subject to great variation in the arrangement of tones and semitones . ” ( Porter-Clarke , note in Camberwell edition . )</p>
   <p>82 . The checkered pavement . This pavement of black and white marble in an elaborate pattern of various sorts of four-sided figures was a gift to Cleon from his own nation .</p>
   <p>100-112 . The similitude is involved but fairly clear . The water that touches the sphere here and there , one point at a time , as the sphere is revolved , represents the power of great geniuses who , each at one point , have reached great heights . The air that fills the sphere represents the composite modern mind that synthesizes the parts into a great whole .</p>
   <p>132 . Drupe . Any stone-fruit . The contrast is between the wild plum and the cultivated plum .</p>
   <p>139 . Homer . The poet to whom very ancient tradition assigns the authorship of the Iliad and the Odyssey . Terpander , the father of Greek music , flourished about 700-650 B. C . Phidias , a famous Athenian sculptor , lived 500-432 B. C . His friend was Pericles , the ruler of Athens .</p>
   <p>304 . Sappho . A Greek poetess . She wrote about 600 B. C .</p>
   <p>305 . Æschylus , a Greek tragic poet , 525-456 B. C .</p>
   <p>340 . Paulus . Paul died about 64 A. D . The date of this poem is therefore about the last quarter of the first century A. D. Cleon had heard so vaguely about the Christian religion that he did not know the difference between Christ and Paul . The “ doctrine ” spoken of in the last line was the Christian teaching concerning immortality . The Greek , Cleon , had felt a longing to believe in another existence in which man would have unlimited capability for joy , but Zeus had revealed no such doctrine , and the cultivated Greek was not ready to receive it at the hands of a man like Paul .</p>

The Madonnas enumerated in ll . 22-25 are the Sistine Madonna , now in the Dresden Gallery ; the Madonna di Foligno , so called because it had been painted as a votive offering for Sigismund Corti of Foligno ; the Madonna del Granduca ( Petti Palace , Florence ) in which the Madonna is represented as appearing to a votary in a vision ; and probably the Madonna called La Belle Jardiniere in the Louvre . There is no evidence that Raphael wrote more than one sonnet , or three at most . The “ century of sonnets ” attributed to him by Browning “ is probably an example of poetical license . ” The volume Guido Reni treasured and left to his heir was a volume with a hundred designs by Raphael . ( Berdoe , Browning Cyclopædia , p. 297 )</p>
   <p>32-57 . Dante 's chief work was his great poem , the Inferno , in which were caustic sketches of evil men of various sorts . The sketch in the lines 35-41 is made up from two descriptions ( Inferno , Cantos 32 , 33 ) of traitors , the one to his country , the other to a familiar friend . The second of these was still alive when Dante wrote ( W. M. Rossetti , Academy , Jan. 10 , 1891 ) . Beatrice , or Bice , was the woman Dante loved . It was on the first anniversary of her death that he began to draw the angel . Dante tells of this in the Vita Nuovo , xxxv , and there describes the interruption of the “ people of importance . ”</p>
   <p>63-4 . To Raphael painting is an art that has become his nature ; to Dante , poetry is an art that has become his nature . But this one time , for the woman of his love , each chooses the art in which he may have some natural skill but for which he has had no technical training .</p>
   <p>73-108 . The “ artist 's sorrow ” as contrasted with the “ man 's joy ” is illustrated from the experiences of Moses in conducting the children of Israel out of Egypt ( Exodus xvii ) . His achievement savors of disrelish because of the grumbling unbelief of the people , and because of the ungracious irritation into which he has been betrayed even when taxing his God-given power to the utmost in their behalf . He must hold steadily to his majesty as a prophet or he cannot control and so serve the crowd , but he covets the man 's joy of doing supreme service to the woman whom he loves .</p>

That is , he usually writes dramatically , giving the experience and uttering the words of the characters he has created , such as the Arab physician , Karshish ; the Greek Cleon ; Norbert , the man whom the Queen loved in “ In a Balcony ” ; the painter , Fra Lippo Lippi ; the heroic pilgrim , Childe Roland ; the painter , Andrea del Sarto . But now , for once , he speaks in his own person , directly to the woman he loves .</p>
   <p>144-156 . In Florence they had seen the new moon , a mere crescent over the hill Fiesole , and had watched its growth till it hung , round and full , over the church of San Miniato . Now , in London , the moon is in its last quarter .</p>

    <head>ABT VOGLER</head>
    <head>Abbé ( or Abt ) Vogler ( 1749-1814 ) was a Catholic priest well known a century ago as an organist and a composer . He founded three schools of music , one at Mannheim , one at Stockholm , and one at Darmstadt . He was especially noted for his organ recitals , as many as 7000 tickets having been sold for a single recital in Amsterdam . In 1798 it was said that he had then given over a thousand organ concerts . His knowledge of acoustics and his consequent skill in combining the stops enabled him to bring much power and variety from organs with fewer pipes than were generally considered necessary . The remodeling and simplification of organs was one of his most eagerly pursued activities . He not only rearranged the pipes , but he introduced free reeds . Through some skillful Swedish organ-builders he was at last enabled to have an organ small enough to be portable and constructed according to his ideas . This he called an “ orchestrion . ” Of Vogler 's power as an organist Rinck says , “ His organ playing was grand , effective in the utmost degree . ” It was , however , when he was improvising that his power was most astonishing . Once at a musical soirée Vogler and Beethoven extemporized alternately , each giving the other a theme , and Gansbacher records the pitch of enthusiasm to which he was roused by Vogler 's masterly playing . Three of Voglers most famous pupils at Darmstadt were Meyerbeer , Gansbacher , and Carl Maria von Weber . The last of these gives an attractive picture of the musician extemporizing in the old church at Darmstadt . “ Never , ” says Weber , “ did Vogler in his extemporization drink more deeply at the source of all beauty , than when before his three dear boys , as he liked to call us , he drew from the organ angelic voices and word of thunder . ” Browning 's poem records the experiences of the musician in one of these moods of rapturous creation .</head>

   <p>“ When Solomon pronounced the Name of God , all the spirits , good and bad , assembled to do His will and build His palace . And when I , Abt Vogler , touched the keys , I called the Spirits of Sound to me , and they have built my palace of music ; and to inhabit it all the Great Dead came back till in the vision I made a perfect music . Nay , for a moment , I touched in it the infinite perfection ; but now it is gone ; I cannot bring it back . Had I painted it , had I written it , I might have explained it . But in music out of the sounds something emerges which is above the sounds , and that ineffable thing I touched and lost . I took the well-known sounds of earth , and out of them came a fourth sound , nay not a sound — but a star . This was a flash of God 's will which opened the Eternal to me for a moment ; and I shall find it again in the eternal life . Therefore , from the achievement of earth and the failure of it , I turn to God , and in Him I see that every image , thought , impulse , and dream of knowledge or beauty — which , coming whence we know not , flit before us in human life , breathe for a moment , and then depart ; which , like my music , build a sudden palace in imagination ; which abide for an instant and dissolve , but which memory and hope retain as a ground of aspiration — are not lost to us though they seem to die in their immediate passage . Their music has its home in the Will of God and we shall find them completed there . ”</p>

The lighting of the lanternoni , or large paper lanterns , each of which looks like a globe of ethereal fire , had been going on for an hour , and by the time we arrived there was nearly completed .... The whole of this immense church — its columns , capitals , cornices , and pediments — the beautiful swell of the lofty dome ... all were designed in lines of fire , and the vast sweep of the circling colonnades ... was resplendent with the same beautiful light . ” ( C.

   <p>96 . The C Major of this life . The musical terms in this passage are fully explained by Mrs. Turnbull and Miss Omerod in Browning Society Papers . Symbolically this line describes the musician as he comes back to everyday life , proud because of the vision that has been granted him , but with a consciousness that experiences so exalted are not for “ human nature 's daily food , ” and that their true function is to send one back to ordinary pains and pleasures with a new acquiescence .</p>
   <p>( In The Browning Society Papers are Mrs. Turnbull 's “ Abt Vogler , ” and three papers by Miss Helen Omerod : ( 1 ) “ Abt Vogler the Man . ” ( 2 ) “ Some Notes on Browning 's Poems relating to Music . ” ( 3 ) “ Andrea del Sarto and Abt Vogler . ” )</p>
   <p>RABBI BEN EZRA</p>
   <p>Ben Ezra was an eminent Jewish Rabbi of the Middle Ages . His Commentaries on the books of the Old Testament are of great value . Mr. A. J. Campbell , who has studied Browning 's poem in connection with the writings of the real Rabbi Ben Ezra , thinks that the distinctive features of the Rabbi of the poem , and the philosophy ascribed to him , were drawn from the works of the historical Rabbi , the keynote of whose teaching was that the essential life of man is the life of the soul , and that age is more important than youth . ( Berdoe , Browning Cyclopædia . Cf . also Berdoe , Browning 's Message to His Times , pp . 157-172 . )</p>
   <p>1 . Grow old along with me . Cf . Saul , lines 161-162 . See Matthew Arnold 's “ ‘ Tis time to grow old ” for a beautiful statement of the pessimistic attitude toward old age .</p>
   <p>7-15 . It would be folly , says the Rabbi , to object to the unreasoning ambitions , the fluctuations of desire , the hopes and fears of youth . In fact ( ll . 16-30 ) , he counts these very aspirations toward the impossible , this very state of mental and spiritual unrest and doubt , a proof of the spark of divinity which separates men from beasts and allies them to God . It is a characteristic Browning doctrine that conflict , struggle , the pangs and throes of learning , are the stimuli through which character develops .</p>
   <p>40-42 . Cf . Saul , l. 295 .</p>
   <p>49-72 . In lines 43-48 the Rabbi had urged the subservience of the body to the soul , but in these lines he shows that the life of the flesh is not to be underestimated , that ideal progress comes from a just alliance Of the soul and the body . See Tennyson 's “ St. Simeon Stylites ” for an account of the ascetic ideal in its lowest form .</p>
   <p>81 . Adventure brave and new . In “ Prospice ” death is reckoned an adversary to be courageously met and overcome . Here the Rabbi is represented as fearless and unperplexed as he contemplates the new life he will lead after death . In both poems we find unquestioning belief in an active and progressive and happy life after death .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">85 . Youth ended , I shall try , etc . Compare Tennyson 's “ By an</l>
     <l n="2">Evolutionist . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>87 . Leave the fire ashes . In this figure the “ fire ” stands for the conflicts of life , the “ gold ” for whatever has proved of permanent worth , and the “ ashes ” for whatever has failed to stand the test of time and experience .</p>
   <p>92 . A certain moment . The moment between the fading of the sunset glory and the shutting down of evening darkness is here selected as the moment in which to appraise the work of the day . In the application of the simile to the life of man ( lines 97-102 ) the “ moment ” apparently refers to old age when man has leisure and wisdom to appraise the Past .</p>
   <p>102 . The Future . The life of his “ adventure brave and new ” after death .</p>
   <p>109-111 . In “ Old Pictures in Florence ” Browning applies this idea to the development of art . As soon as men were content to repose in the perfection of Greek art ( the thing “ found made ” ) stagnation ensued ; the new life of art came when men strove for something new and original , even though their first attempts were crude ( “ acts uncouth ” ) .</p>
   <p>120 . Nor let thee feel alone . The solitude of age gives a chance for unhampered thought .</p>
   <p>133-150 . One of the things he has learned is that any judgment to be fair must take into account instincts , efforts , desires , as well as accomplishment .</p>
   <p>151-186 . This metaphor of the wheel is found in Isaiah lxiv , 8 ; Jeremiah xviii , 2-6 ; Romans ix , 21 . Throughout this metaphor as Browning uses it , man seems to be “ passive clay ” in the hands of the potter , and under the power of the “ machinery ” the potter uses to give the soul its bent . The tone of the whole poem is , however , one of strenuous endeavor . Ardor , effort , progress , are the keynotes of life from youth to age . But life is finally counted a divine training for the service of God , and in this training the pious Rabbi sees joined the will of man and the care and guidance of God .</p>

   <lg type="poem">
    <head>CALIBAN UPON SETEBOS</head>
    <head>The idea of this poem was evolved from Shakspere 's Caliban , a strange , misshapen , fish-like being , one of the servants of Prospero in The Tempest . He was the son of a foul witch who had potent ministers and could control moon and tides , but could not undo her own hateful sorceries , and who worshiped a god called Setebos . Morally , Shakspere 's Caliban was insensible to kindness , had bestial passions , was cowardly , vengeful , superstitious . He had keen animal instincts and knew the island well . He understood Prospero in some measure ; learned to talk , to know the stars , to compose poetry , and took pleasure in music .</head>
     <l n="1">Thou thoughtest , etc . A quotation from Psalms 1 , 21 . This sentence</l>
     <l n="2">is the keynote of Caliban 's theological speculations .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>1 . Will . For “ he will ” instead of “ I will . ” Through most of the poem Caliban speaks of himself in the third person as a child does . But note lines 68-97 , where Caliban rises to unusual mental heights under the stimulus of the gourd-fruit-mash and uses the first person . How is it in ll . 100-108 , 135-136 , 160 ?</p>
   <p>1-23 . This portion of Caliban 's soliloquy and the portion in lines 284-295 give the setting for his speculations . The hot , still summer day creates a mood in which Caliban 's ideas flow out easily into speech . The thunderstorm at the end abruptly calls him back from his speculations to his normal state of subservience and superstitious fear .</p>
   <p>24 . Setebos . The god of the Patagonians . When the natives were taken prisoners by Magellan , they “ cryed upon their devil Setebos to help them . ” Eden , History of Travaile .</p>
   <p>25 . He . The pronoun of the third person when referring to Setebos is capitalized .</p>
   <p>31 . It came of being ill at ease . Each step in Caliban 's reasoning proceeds from some personal experience or observation . In this case he reasons from the fish to Setebos . Caliban attributes to Setebos unlimited power to create and control in whatever is comparatively near at hand and changeable . But Caliban had been affected by the mystery of the starry heavens . The remoteness and fixedness of the stars had suggested a quiet , unalterable , passionless force beyond Setebos , who must , therefore , have limitations . He did not make the stars ( l. 27 ) , he cannot create a mate like himself ( ll . 57-8 ) , he cannot change his nature so as to be like the Quiet above him ( ll . 144-5 ) . Hence , like the fish , Setebos had a dissatisfied consciousness of a bliss he was not born for . Discontent with himself , spite , envy , restlessness , love of power as a means of distraction , are the motives that , according to Caliban 's reasoning , actuated Setebos in his creation of the world .</p>
   <p>45 . The fowls here , beast and creeping thing . Browning 's remarkably minute and accurate knowledge of small animals is well illustrated by this poem . For further illustration see Saul , the last soliloquy in Pippa Passes , and the lyric “ Thus the Mayne glideth . ”</p>
   <p>75 . Put case , etc . In determining the natural attitude of Setebos toward his creations , the formula Caliban uses is , Caliban plus power equals Setebos . The illustration from the bird ( ll . 75-97 ) shows cruelty , and unreasoning , capricious exercise of power . The caprice of Setebos is further emphasized in ll . 100-108 .</p>
   <p>117 . Hath cut a pipe . In his attitude toward his creatures Setebos is envious of all human worth or happiness if it is for a moment unconscious of absolute dependence on him .</p>
   <p>150 . Himself peeped late , etc . As Caliban gets some poor solace out of imitating Prospero , so one reason for Setebos 's creation of the world was a half-scornful attempt to delude himself into apparent content . His imitations , his “ make believes , ” are the unwilling homage his weakness pays to the power of the Quiet .</p>
   <p>170-184 . The weaknesses of all living beings were special devices whereby Setebos could , through need and fear , torture and rule .</p>
   <p>185-199 . Setebos worked also out of pure ennui . He liked the exercise of power , he liked to use his “ wit , ” and he needed distraction .</p>
   <p>200-210 . Setebos hates and favors human beings without discoverable reason .</p>
   <p>211-285 . It is impossible to discover a way to please Setebos . His favor goes by caprice as does Caliban 's with the daring squirrel and the terrified urchin , who please one day , and , doing the same things the next , would bring down vengeance . The only philosophy at which Caliban can arrive is that it is best not to be too happy . Simulated misery is more likely to escape than any show of happiness .</p>
   <p>MAY AND DEATH</p>
   <p>In memory of Browning 's cousin , James Silverthorne , the “ Charles ” of the poem . The “ one plant ” of the last two stanzas is supposed to be the Spotted Persicaria , “ a common weed with purple stains upon its rather large leaves . ” According to popular tradition this plant grew beneath the Cross , and the stains were made by drops of blood from the Savior 's wounds .

   <p>A WALL</p>
   <p>This poem was written and printed as the Prologue to Pacchiarotto and How he Worked in Distemper , published in 1876 . It was , however , given the title “ A Wall ” when published in 1880 in Selections from Robert Browning 's Poems , Second Series . The last two stanzas express one of the fundamental ideas of Browning 's poetry . Under the figure of the wall with its pulsating robe of vines and the eagerness of the lover to penetrate to the life within the house , he sets forth his thought of the barrier between himself and a longed-for future life in heaven . The “ forth to thee ” is to be interpreted as referring to his wife .</p>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>HOUSE AND SHOP</head>
    <head>Three of Browning 's poems , “ At the Mermaid , ” “ House , ” and “ Shop , ” refer with more or less explicitness to Shakspere . The last stanza in “ House ” contains a quotation from Wordsworth 's “ Scorn not the Sonnet ” to the effect that in his sonnets Shakspere revealed the most intimate facts of his life . “ At the Mermaid ” and “ House ” both combat this idea . In “ At the Mermaid ” Browning in the person of Shakspere says :</head>
     <l n="1">“ Which of you did I enable</l>
     <l n="2">Once to slip within my breast ,</l>
     <l n="3">There to catalogue and label</l>
     <l n="4">What I like least , what love best ,</l>
     <l n="5">Hope and fear , believe and doubt of ,</l>
     <l n="6">Seek and shun , respect — deride ?</l>
     <l n="7">Who has right to make a rout of</l>
     <l n="8">Rarities he found inside ? ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>As applied to Browning the poems represent the indignation with which he regarded such personal revelations , such utterance of sighs and groans , as characterized Byron ( the “ Last King ” of “ At the Mermaid ” ) ; but they overstate the impersonal nature of Browning 's own work which is frequently a very direct statement of his own emotions and views , while even from his dramatic work it is not difficult to find his “ hopes and fears , beliefs and doubts . ” In stanzas 10-12 of “ At the Mermaid , ” for example , just after he has protested against “ leaving bosom 's gate ajar , ” he fully sets forth the joy , the optimism , of his own outlook on life . “ Shop ” is an indirect protest against the assumption that Shakspere wrote mainly for money , caring merely for the material success of his work . ( See Poet-Lore , Vol . III , pp . 216-221 , April , 1889 , for Browning 's tribute to Shakspere . ) More directly the poem represents the starved life of the man whom “ shop , ” the business necessary to earn a living , occupies “ each day and all day long ” with no spirit-life behind .</p>

    <head>HERVÉ RIEL</head>
    <head>This poem was written during Browning 's second visit to Le Croisic in Brittany , in September , 1867 . It was published in The Cornhill Magazine , March , 1871 , the proceeds of one hundred guineas being sent by Browning to the Paris Relief Fund , to provide food for the people after the siege of Paris . The story is historic . Mrs. Lemoyne , in 1884 , read “ Hervé Riel ” to Browning and he then told her that it was his custom to learn all about the heroes and legends of any town that he stopped in and that he had thus , in going over the records of the town of St. Malo , come upon the story of Hervé Riel , which he narrated just as it happened in 1692 , except that in reality the hero had a life holiday . “ The facts of the story had been forgotten , and were denied at St. Malo ; but the reports of the French Admiralty were looked up , and the facts established . ” ( Dr. Furnivall quoted in Berdoe , Browning Cyclopædia . )</head>

   </lg>
   <p>THE PATRIOT</p>
   <p>Browning says that this poem has no direct historical reference . He calls it “ An Old Story , ” because in all ages men have experienced this unjust reversal of public approval . The poem is merely an imaginative , dramatic representation of the fickleness of popular favor .</p>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>INSTANS TYRANNUS</head>
    <head>The title of this poem means “ Threatening Tyrant . ” It comes from Horace 's “ Ode on the Just Man , ” in Odes , III , 3 , i . The just man is not frightened by the frown of the threatening tyrant — non vullus instantis tyranni . Archdeacon Farrar refers the incidents to persecution of the early Christians . The poem certainly deals with some period when the ruler of a great realm had unlimited power to follow out his most insignificant animosities , and when just men and just causes had no human recourse .</head>
     <l n="1">The general idea of the poem is clear and forcible , but there are many</l>
     <l n="2">minor difficulties of interpretation .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>6 . What was his force ? An ironic question . The man groveled because he was powerless to resist , and ( line 10 ) because resistance might bring even worse punishment .</p>
   <p>11 . Were the object , etc . If the man could be made rich , if his life could be crowded with pleasures , if there could be found relatives or friends whom he loved , then there would be obvious ways of hurting him , he would stand forth in sufficient importance to make the swing of the tyrant 's hand effective . But as it is , the man 's poverty and friendlessness and meagerness of life render it difficult to find out vulnerable points of attack . He remains hidden ( perdue ) and , like the midge of the egg of an insect ( nit ) , is safe through his very insignificance .</p>
   <p>21. spilth . That which is poured out profusely . The flagon is a vessel with one handle and a long narrow neck or spout .</p>
   <p>35 . Then a humor , etc . The tyrant goes through various changes of mood in his attitude toward his enemy . In lines 35-43 he feels a moment of contemptuous compunction at the man 's suffering , and recognizes the absurdity of a contest between a great king and a person as insignificant as a tricksy elf , a toad , or a rat . But in line 44 his mood turns . He perceives that the burden ( gravamen ) of the whole matter lies in the incredibly petty nature of this unconquerable , baffling opposition to his will . He sees how the situation would awaken the wonder of the great lords who abjectly obey his lightest word , but he concludes that , after all , the small becomes great if it vexes you .</p>
   <p>53 . I soberly , etc . Even the tyrant sees a kind of grotesque humor as he narrates first the elaborate plans to entrap and crush so seemingly powerless a foe , and then the striking reversal of position when the man proves to have God on his side , and the tyrant becomes the one to cower in fear .</p>

    <head>THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND</head>
    <head>At the Congress of Vienna , in 1815 , Lombardy and Venetia were assigned to Austria . Most of the inhabitants submitted to the foreign rule , but there were always small bands of patriots who stirred up revolutions against Austria . The chief revolution was that led by Mazzini in 1848 , and when he was in exile he read this poem with much appreciation . In Pippa Passes ( 1840 ) , in the story of Luigi and the Austrian police , Browning had already given a picture based on Italy 's struggle for freedom . In 1844 he visited Italy and then wrote “ The Italian in England , ” which appeared in 1845 . This poem does not represent a definite historic incident , but such a one as might have occurred in the life of some Italian patriot . For a similar feeling towards Italian independence see Mrs. Browning 's Casa Guidi Windows ( written 1848-1851 ) . For earlier poems see Byron 's “ Ode ” beginning “ O Venice , Venice , when thy marble walls , ” Shelley 's “ Lines Written Among the Euganean Hills , ” and the following sonnet by Wordsworth :</head>

   <p>PROLOGUE TO ASOLANDO</p>
   <p>The volume of poems entitled Asolando was , by a strange chance , published on the day of Browning 's death . Most of these poems were written in 1888-1889 . The book was dedicated to Mrs. Arthur Bronson . The “ Prologue ” should be compared with Wordsworth 's “ Ode on Intimations of Immortality . ”</p>
   <p>13 . Chrysopras . The ruby and the emerald of this passage stand for rich red and green . The chrysopras is also green ( an apple green variety of Chalcedony ) , but the first part of the word is from the Greek [ Greek : chrysos ] , “ gold , ” and that may be the color intended here .</p>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>SUMMUM BONUM</head>
     <l n="1">The title means , The Chief Good . The poem came out in Asolando in</l>

   <lg type="poem">
    <head>EPILOGUE TO ASOLANDO</head>
     <l n="1">In the Pall Mall Gazette , Feb. 1 , 1890 the following incident is given</l>
     <l n="2">concerning the third stanza of this poem :</l>
   </lg>
   <p>“ One evening just before his death illness , the poet was reading this from a proof to his daughter-in-law and sister . He said : ‘ It almost looks like bragging to say this , and as if I ought to cancel it ; but it 's the simple truth ; and as it 's true , it shall stand . ’ ”</p>
   <p>Compare this poem and Tennyson 's “ Crossing the Bar . ”</p>
   <p>PIPPA PASSES</p>
   <p>Mrs. Sutherland Orr writes that while Browning was one day strolling through Dulwich Wood “ the image flashed upon him of someone walking ... alone through life ; one apparently too obscure to leave a trace of his or her passage , yet exercising a lasting though unconscious influence at every step of it ; and the image shaped itself into the little silk-winder of Asolo , Felippa , or Pippa . ”</p>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>INTRODUCTION</head>
    <head>Asolo in the Trevisan . Asolo , a fortified medieval town at the foot of a hill surmounted by the ruins of a castle , and situated in the center of the silk-growing and silk-spinning industries , is in the province of Treviso about thirty-three miles northwest of Venice .</head>
     <l n="1">62 . Monsignor . A title conferred upon prelates in the Roman Catholic</l>
     <l n="2">church . This Monsignor is the chief personage in Part III , or Night .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>88 . Martagon . A kind of lily with light purplish flowers . The common name is Turk 's Cap . Perhaps that suggested to Browning his comparison to the round bunch of flesh on the head of a Turk bird , or turkey .</p>
   <p>131 . Possagno church . Designed by Canova , who was born at Possagno , an obscure village near Asolo .</p>
   <p>181 . The Dome . The Duomo , or Cathedral , in the center of the town . The palace of the Bishop 's brother is close by .</p>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>MORNING</head>
    <head>28 . St. Mark 's . There is an extensive view from Asolo . Venice , with its cupolas and steeples , is seen to the east . Ottima detects the belfry of the Church of St. Mark . The towns of Vicenza and Padua are also discernible .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">59 . The Capuchin . A branch of the Franciscan order of monks . Their</l>
     <l n="2">habit is brown .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">170 . Campanula chalice . The flower of any one of a large genus of</l>
     <l n="4">flowers with bell-shaped corollas .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>INTERLUDE I</p>
   <p>27 . El canibus nostris . Virgil , Eclogues iii , 67 . “ Notior ut jam sit canibus non Delia nostris ” — “ So that now not Delia 's self is more familiar to our dogs . ” The boy Giovacchino of whose poetry they are making fun evidently had ideals not in harmony with the ways of these Venetian art students . These “ dissolute , brutalized , heartless bunglers , ” as Jules calls them , attack with quick , clever , merciless tongues whatever savors of idealism , aspiration , purity . Their revenge for the scornful superiority manifested towards them by Jules is to secure , by a well-managed trick , a marriage between him and a paid model .</p>
   <p>86 . Canova 's gallery . Possagno was the birthplace of the sculptor Canova , and the circular church there was designed by him . In the gallery at Possagno is his Psyche ( Psiche-fanciulla , or Psyche the young girl ) ; his Pietà ( the mother with the dead Christ in her arms ) is in the church .</p>
   <p>111 . Malamocco . A little town on an island near Venice .</p>
   <p>111 . Alciphron . A Greek writer ( about 200 A. D .) of fictitious letters famous for the purity of their style and for the knowledge they give of Greek social customs .</p>
   <p>115 . Lire . Plural of lira , an Italian coin equal to 18. 6 cents in our money .</p>
   <p>117 . A scented letter . Forged letters have represented this fourteen year old , ignorant model as delicate , shy , reserved , intellectually alert , with lofty poetic and artistic ideals .</p>
   <p>117 . Tydeus . One of the Seven Allies in the enterprise against Thebes . Jules is supposed to have modeled a statue of him for the Venetian Academy of Fine Arts . From Scene II , 14 , we see that it is still in clay .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">120 . Paolina . Some actress at the Phenix , the leading theater of</l>
     <l n="2">Venice .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">140 . Hannibal Scratchy . In jest they burlesque the name of Annibale</l>
     <l n="4">Caracci , a famous Italian artist , and apply it to one of their number .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>NOON</p>
   <p>39 . This minion . This favorite . Bessarion ( 1395-1472 ) , a learned Greek cardinal , discovered a poem , “ The Rape of Helen , ” written by a Greek epic poet , Coluthus , in the sixth century , and Bessarion 's scribe copied it out on parchment with blue , red , and dark-brown lettering .</p>
   <p>43 . Odyssey . Homer 's account of the adventures of Ulysses . The quoted passage is in the Odyssey , Bk . XXII , 10 . When Ulysses reached home he wreaked vengeance on the suitors of his wife . Antinous was the first to fall . The story of the “ bitter shaft ” blotted out by a flower is symbolic of the story of the hatred of Lutwyche , which was robbed of its bitterness by Phene 's love .</p>
   <p>50 . Almaign Kaiser . The German Emperor . Swart-green is really “ black-green ” ; here it means the “ dark-green ” of bronze . The Emperor 's truncheon is a short staff , the emblem of his office .</p>
   <p>54 . Hippolyta . The Queen of the Amazons on a fine horse from Numidia .</p>
   <p>59 . Bay-filleted . The bay or laurel with which victors were crowned was supposed to be an antidote against thunder because it was the tree of Apollo . Pliny says that Tiberius and some other Roman emperors wore a wreath of bay leaves as an amulet , especially in thunder-storms . ( See Brewer , Dictionary of Phrase and Fable ; also Byron , Childe Harold , IV , 41 . )</p>
   <p>61 . Hipparchus . In B. C. 514 Harmodius and Aristogeiton conspired against the tyrants Hippias and Hipparchus , and carrying swords hid in myrtle , they slew Hipparchus . Cf . Byron , Childe Harold , III , 20 .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ All that most endears</l>
     <l n="2">Glory , is when the myrtle wreathes a sword</l>
     <l n="3">Such as Harmodius drew on Athens ’ tyrant lord . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="4">75 . Parsley . An aromatic herb used in ancient time in crowns worn at</l>
     <l n="5">feasts .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>86 . Archetype . The original pattern or model . Beautiful colors and shapes in flowers , in flames , trees , and fruit suggested to the poet the beauty of perfect human forms . The rosy bloom of the peach bending close over the bough and nestled among the leaves is sufficient to suggest rosy limbs , and from that suggestion comes the whole imaginative picture of the dryad , the nymph of the woods .</p>
   <p>95 . Facile chalk . Jules exults in the facility with which the artist , in any realm of art , manipulates his implements and his materials . His especial enthusiasm is for marble , which he has come to regard as an original , primitive substance , containing in itself all other substances . It may be made to seem as light and clear as air , as brilliant as diamonds . Sometimes as his chisel strikes , it seems to be metal . Again it seems to be actual flesh and blood . At moments when the sculptor works with swift intensity it seems to flush and glow like flame .</p>
   <p>181 . I am a painter , etc . The poem by Lutwyche is professedly “ slow , involved , and mystical . ” But Jules gradually perceives the purport of the words . Lutwyche 's hate is to have its most hideous possible aspect because it is to appear suddenly through Love 's rose-braided mask .</p>
   <p>272 . The Cornaro . Catharine Cornaro was the wife of James , King of Cyprus . After his death she was induced to abdicate in favor of the Republic of Venice , which took possession of Cyprus in 1487 . She was assigned a palace and court at Asolo . She was generous , kind , just , and deeply beloved . Her life seemed to hold all possible external conditions of happiness . The song is further explained in lines 275-279 .</p>
   <p>306 . Ancona . A lovely city in eastern Italy .</p>
   <p>INTERLUDE II</p>
   <p>1 . Bluphocks . Browning 's note on this character reads , “ He maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good , and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust . ” ( Matthew v , 45 . )</p>
   <p>2 . Your Bishop 's Intendant . The Bishop 's Superintendent ( whose real name is Maffeo ) has charge of the estate the Bishop has just inherited from his brother . The money Bluphocks has is the bribe given him by Maffeo to destroy Pippa , who is really the heir to the estate . Maffeo expects the Bishop to reward him well for this service .</p>
   <p>11 . Prussia Improper . “ The arm of land bounded on the north by the Baltic and on the south by Poland was long called ‘ Prussia Proper ’ to distinguish it from the other provinces of the kingdom . Königsberg is just over the boundary of Brandenberg . ” ( Rolfe , Select Poems of Browning . )</p>
   <p>14 . Chaldee . A Semitic dialect .</p>
   <p>21 . Celarent , Darii , Ferio . Coined words used in logic to designate certain valid forms of syllogism .</p>
   <p>24 . Posy . A brief inscription or motto originally in verse , and suitable for a ring or some trinket .</p>
   <p>25 . How Moses , etc . For the story of Moses and the plagues of Egypt see Exodus viii and x . For the story of Jonah ( who was commanded , however , not to go to Tarshish ) see Jonah i . For Balaam and his ass see Numbers xxii , 22 .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">33 . Bishop Beveridge . There was a Bishop of that name , but of course</l>
     <l n="2">Bluphocks is making a pun .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>35 . Charon 's wherry . Charon was a god of hell . It was his business to carry the dead across the river Styx . People thus carried over the Stygian ferry paid Charon by a small coin put between their lips .</p>
   <p>36 . Lupine-seed . “ In plant-lore ‘ lupine ’ means wolfish , and is suggestive of the Evil One . ” ( Berdoe , Browning Cyclopædia . )</p>
   <p>36 . Hecate 's supper . Hecate was a goddess of hell to whom offerings of food were made . An obolus is a silver coin worth about fifteen cents .</p>
   <p>39 . Zwanziger . A twenty-kreuzer piece of money .</p>
   <p>47 . Prince Metternich . A celebrated Austrian statesman . ( 1773-1859 . )</p>
   <p>54 . Panurge . A prominent character in Gargantua and Pantagruel by Rabelais . Hertrippa is a magician who gives Panurge advice on the subject of marriage . Bluphocks is simply racking his brain for words to rhyme with “ Pippa , ” so that he may write doggerel poetry to or about her . For “ King Agrippa ” see Acts xxvi , 27 .</p>
   <p>77 . Carbonari . All persons leaving a city had to have a passport officially signed giving the destination and the date of departure . Luigi had obtained such a passport for Vienna for that night . It was , however , suspected that this was a mere trick to give a wrong notion of his whereabouts . If the passport should prove to be a pretense , other suspicions against Luigi would be confirmed ; it would be taken for granted that he belonged to the Carbonari , a secret society of Italian patriots ; he would be arrested and sent to the prison at Spielberg . But if he should go to Vienna he is to be let alone . The officers are , of course , on the wrong track . If Luigi goes to Vienna it is to carry out his purpose of killing the tyrant . If he stays in Asolo it means that he has abandoned that purpose .</p>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>EVENING</head>
     <l n="1">6 . Lucius Junius . This name comes easily to Luigi 's lips because</l>
     <l n="2">Lucius Junius Brutus inspired the Romans against Tarquin .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>14 . Old Franz . The Austrian Emperor , Francis , I. Luigi 's fancy is caught by the echoes and the flowers , but they play into his dominant idea of the freedom of Italy .</p>
   <p>19 . Pellicos . Silvio Pellico was an Italian patriot who had suffered a long imprisonment in Spielberg Castle .</p>
   <p>122 . Andrea , etc . Three former Italian patriots who had conspired against Austria .</p>
   <p>135-143 . Note in these lines how little Luigi really understands of the point at issue . His emotional temperament has been stirred to the point of desperate action , but the “ ground for killing the King ” he hardly knows .</p>
   <p>152 . Jupiter . The largest of the planets . When a planet rises after midnight it becomes a morning star .</p>
   <p>163 . Titian at Treviso . Treviso is seventeen miles from Venice . Its cathedral contains a fine Annunciation by Titian which Luigi and his betrothed Chiara had planned to see together .</p>
   <p>164 . A king lived long ago . This song was published in 1835 and later adapted for this poem . The song has a great effect on Luigi because beside his mental picture of the hated Austrian ruler he now places his old folk-king who judged his people wisely , whose dignity and grace awed even a python , and whom the gods loved . The possibility of having good kings stirs his waning determination to rid the earth of evil ones .</p>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>INTERLUDE III</head>
    <head>6 . The same treat . The feast of the girl is made up of fig-peckers ( birds that feed on figs ) , lampreys ( eel-like fish esteemed a delicacy ) , and red wine from Breganze , a town noted for its wines .</head>
    <head>17 . Spring 's come , etc . These girls are well differentiated . The “ first girl ” is set apart from the others by her superior refinement , by her longing for her country home , and by her unhappiness with Cecco . The “ third girl ” seems to be the leader in the plan against Pippa .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">

   <p>36 . Jules . This is the Jules of Noon . His history is thus carried on beyond the point where we left him at the close of his interview with Phene .</p>
   <p>51 . Correggio . An Italian artist ( 1494-1534 ) .</p>
   <p>72 . Podere . ( Plural , poderi . ) A small farm or manor .</p>
   <p>83 . Cesena . An Episcopal city about twelve miles from Forli .</p>
   <p>108 . Millet-cake . A cake made of an Italian grain and eaten only by the poorest classes .</p>
   <p>135 . Letter No . 3 . The information from Rome is based on a wrong assumption . The elder brother had an infant heir whom the second brother endeavored to put out of the way in order that he might himself inherit the estate . He hired Maffeo to destroy the child , and , according to the information from Rome , Maffeo did so . On this assumption Maffeo is to be arrested and the money and land given him by the second brother to keep the deed a secret are now to revert to the church .</p>
   <p>154 . So old a story . In reality Maffeo has been more astute than they thought . He did not kill the child but kept it ready to produce as the heir to the estates if the second brother at any time proved delinquent in the required payments .</p>
   <p>174 . Let us understand one another . He believes that when the Bishop sees himself about to lose the estate , he too will show himself ready for a bargain . The Bishop is simply to keep still and Maffeo will see that the heir — who is Pippa — shall be finally brought to shame and death . The Bishop is to have the estates , and Maffeo is to keep his ill-gotten gains and be given a chance to escape . The Bishop is apparently listening to the tempter when he hears Pippa 's song . Its fresh lilting sweetness , and especially , perhaps , the wording of the last line , touch his heart and his conscience , and he suddenly orders Maffeo 's arrest , at the same time uttering the prayer , “ Have mercy upon me , O God . ”</p>

   <p>30 . Monsignor 's people . Zanze was apparently talking to Pippa under the Monsignor 's window . Pippa broke off the unwelcome talk by her song , and Zanze had hardly time to begin again when there came the noise of the arrest of Maffeo .</p>
