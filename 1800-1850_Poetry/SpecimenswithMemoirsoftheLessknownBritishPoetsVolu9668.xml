   <p>SPECIMENS WITH MEMOIRS OF THE LESS-KNOWN BRITISH POETS .</p>
   <p>SECOND PERIOD — FROM SPENSER TO DRYDEN . ( CONTINUED . )</p>
   <p>WILLIAM HABINGTON .</p>
   <p>This poet might have been expected to have belonged to the ‘ Spasmodic school , ’ judging by his parental antecedents . His father was accused of having a share in Babington 's conspiracy , but was released because he was godson to Queen Elizabeth . Soon after , however , he was imprisoned a second time , and condemned to death on the charge of having concealed some of the Gunpowder-plot conspirators ; but was pardoned through the interest of Lord Morley . His uncle , however , was less fortunate , suffering death for his complicity with Babington . The poet 's mother , the daughter of Lord Morley , was more loyal than her husband or his brother , and is said to have written the celebrated letter to Lord Monteagle , in consequence of which the execution of the Gunpowder-plot was arrested .</p>
   <p>Our poet was born at Hindlip , Worcestershire , on the very day of the discovery of the plot , 5th November 1605 . The family were Papists , and William was sent to St Omers to be educated . He was pressed to become a Jesuit , but declined . On his return to England , his father became preceptor to the poet . As he grew up , instead of displaying any taste for ‘ treasons , stratagems , and spoils , ’ he chose the better part , and lived a private and happy life . He fell in love with Lucia , daughter of William Herbert , the first Lord Powis , and celebrated her in his long and curious poem entitled ‘ Castara . ’ This lady he afterwards married , and from her society appears to have derived much happiness . In 1634 , he published ‘ Castara . ’ He also , at different times , produced ‘ The Queen of Arragon , ’ a tragedy ; a History of Edward IV . ; and ‘ Observations upon History . ’ He died in 1654 , ( not as Southey , by a strange oversight , says , ‘ when he had just completed his fortieth year , ’ ) forty-nine years of age , and was buried in the family vault at Hindlip .</p>
   <p>‘ Castara ’ is not a consecutive poem , but consists of a great variety of small pieces , in all sorts of style and rhythm , and of all varieties of merit ; many of them addressed to his mistress under the name of Castara , and many to his friends ; with reflective poems , elegies , and panegyrics , intermingled with verses sacred to love . Habington is distinguished by purity of tone if not of taste . He has many conceits , but no obscenities . His love is as holy as it is ardent . He has , besides , a vein of sentiment which sometimes approaches the moral sublime . To prove this , in addition to the ‘ Selections ’ below , we copy some verses entitled —</p>
   <p>‘ NOX NOCTI INDICAT SCIENTIAM . ’ — David .</p>

     <l n="37">Thus those celestial fires ,</l>

     <l n="40">And all the pride of life , confute ;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="41">For they have watch 'd since first</l>

     <l n="44">And nothing permanent on earth .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>There is something to us particularly interesting in the history of this poet . Even as it is pleasant to see the sides of a volcano covered with verdure , and its mouth filled with flowers , so we like to find the fierce elements , which were inherited by Habington from his fathers , softened and subdued in him ,— the blood of the conspirator mellowed into that of the gentle bard , who derived all his inspiration from a pure love and a mild and thoughtful religion .</p>

    <head>EPISTLE ADDRESSED TO THE HONOURABLE W. E .</head>
     <l n="1">He who is good is happy . Let the loud</l>
     <l n="2">Artillery of heaven break through a cloud ,</l>
     <l n="3">And dart its thunder at him , he 'll remain</l>
     <l n="4">Unmoved , and nobler comfort entertain ,</l>
     <l n="5">In welcoming the approach of death , than Vice</l>
     <l n="6">E'er found in her fictitious paradise .</l>
     <l n="7">Time mocks our youth , and ( while we number past</l>
     <l n="8">Delights , and raise our appetite to taste</l>
     <l n="9">Ensuing ) brings us to unflatter 'd age ,</l>
     <l n="10">Where we are left to satisfy the rage</l>
     <l n="11">Of threat'ning death : pomp , beauty , wealth , and all</l>
     <l n="12">Our friendships , shrinking from the funeral .</l>
     <l n="13">The thought of this begets that brave disdain</l>
     <l n="14">With which thou view'st the world , and makes those vain</l>
     <l n="15">Treasures of fancy , serious fools so court ,</l>
     <l n="16">And sweat to purchase , thy contempt or sport .</l>
     <l n="17">What should we covet here ? Why interpose</l>
     <l n="18">A cloud ‘ twixt us and heaven ? Kind Nature chose</l>
     <l n="19">Man 's soul the exchequer where to hoard her wealth ,</l>
     <l n="20">And lodge all her rich secrets ; but by the stealth</l>
     <l n="21">Of her own vanity , we 're left so poor ,</l>
     <l n="22">The creature merely sensual knows more .</l>
     <l n="23">The learned halcyon , by her wisdom , finds</l>
     <l n="24">A gentle season , when the seas and winds</l>
     <l n="25">Are silenced by a calm , and then brings forth</l>
     <l n="26">The happy miracle of her rare birth ,</l>
     <l n="27">Leaving with wonder all our arts possess 'd ,</l>
     <l n="28">That view the architecture of her nest .</l>
     <l n="29">Pride raiseth us ‘ bove justice . We bestow</l>
     <l n="30">Increase of knowledge on old minds , which grow</l>
     <l n="31">By age to dotage ; while the sensitive</l>
     <l n="32">Part of the world in its first strength doth live .</l>
     <l n="33">Folly ! what dost thou in thy power contain</l>
     <l n="34">Deserves our study ? Merchants plough the main</l>
     <l n="35">And bring home th ’ Indies , yet aspire to more ,</l>
     <l n="36">By avarice in the possession poor .</l>
     <l n="37">And yet that idol wealth we all admit</l>
     <l n="38">Into the soul 's great temple ; busy wit</l>
     <l n="39">Invents new orgies , fancy frames new rites</l>
     <l n="40">To show its superstition ; anxious nights</l>
     <l n="41">Are watch 'd to win its favour : while the beast</l>
     <l n="42">Content with nature 's courtesy doth rest .</l>
     <l n="43">Let man then boast no more a soul , since he</l>
     <l n="44">Hath lost that great prerogative . But thee ,</l>
     <l n="45">Whom fortune hath exempted from the herd</l>
     <l n="46">Of vulgar men , whom virtue hath preferr 'd</l>
     <l n="47">Far higher than thy birth , I must commend ,</l>
     <l n="48">Rich in the purchase of so sweet a friend .</l>
     <l n="49">And though my fate conducts me to the shade</l>
     <l n="50">Of humble quiet , my ambition paid</l>
     <l n="51">With safe content , while a pure virgin fame</l>
     <l n="52">Doth raise me trophies in Castara 's name ;</l>
     <l n="53">No thought of glory swelling me above</l>
     <l n="54">The hope of being famed for virtuous love ;</l>
     <l n="55">Yet wish I thee , guided by the better stars ,</l>
     <l n="56">To purchase unsafe honour in the wars ,</l>
     <l n="57">Or envied smiles at court ; for thy great race ,</l>
     <l n="58">And merits , well may challenge the highest place .</l>
     <l n="59">Yet know , what busy path soe'er you tread</l>
     <l n="60">To greatness , you must sleep among the dead .</l>

    <head>TO HIS NOBLEST FRIEND , J. C ., ESQ .</head>
     <l n="1">I hate the country 's dirt and manners , yet</l>
     <l n="2">I love the silence ; I embrace the wit</l>
     <l n="3">And courtship , flowing here in a full tide ,</l>
     <l n="4">But loathe the expense , the vanity , and pride .</l>
     <l n="5">No place each way is happy . Here I hold</l>
     <l n="6">Commerce with some , who to my care unfold</l>
     <l n="7">( After a due oath minister 'd ) the height</l>
     <l n="8">And greatness of each star shines in the state ,</l>
     <l n="9">The brightness , the eclipse , the influence .</l>
     <l n="10">With others I commune , who tell me whence</l>
     <l n="11">The torrent doth of foreign discord flow ;</l>
     <l n="12">Relate each skirmish , battle , overthrow ,</l>
     <l n="13">Soon as they happen ; and by rote can tell</l>
     <l n="14">Those German towns , even puzzle me to spell .</l>
     <l n="15">The cross or prosperous fate of princes they</l>
     <l n="16">Ascribe to rashness , cunning , or delay ;</l>
     <l n="17">And on each action comment , with more skill</l>
     <l n="18">Than upon Livy did old Machiavel .</l>
     <l n="19">O busy folly ! why do I my brain</l>
     <l n="20">Perplex with the dull policies of Spain ,</l>
     <l n="21">Or quick designs of France ? Why not repair</l>
     <l n="22">To the pure innocence o ’ the country air ,</l>
     <l n="23">And neighbour thee , dear friend ? Who so dost give</l>
     <l n="24">Thy thoughts to worth and virtue , that to live</l>
     <l n="25">Blest , is to trace thy ways . There might not we</l>
     <l n="26">Arm against passion with philosophy ;</l>
     <l n="27">And , by the aid of leisure , so control</l>
     <l n="28">Whate'er is earth in us , to grow all soul ?</l>
     <l n="29">Knowledge doth ignorance engender , when</l>
     <l n="30">We study mysteries of other men ,</l>
     <l n="31">And foreign plots . Do but in thy own shad</l>
     <l n="32">( Thy head upon some flow'ry pillow laid ,</l>
     <l n="33">Kind Nature 's housewifery ,) contemplate all</l>
     <l n="34">His stratagems , who labours to enthrall</l>
     <l n="35">The world to his great master , and you 'll find</l>
     <l n="36">Ambition mocks itself , and grasps the wind .</l>
     <l n="37">Not conquest makes us great . Blood is too dear</l>
     <l n="38">A price for glory . Honour doth appear</l>
     <l n="39">To statesmen like a vision in the night ;</l>
     <l n="40">And , juggler-like , works o ’ the deluded sight .</l>
     <l n="41">The unbusied only wise : for no respect</l>
     <l n="42">Endangers them to error ; they affect</l>
     <l n="43">Truth in her naked beauty , and behold</l>
     <l n="44">Man with an equal eye , not bright in gold ,</l>
     <l n="45">Or tall in little ; so much him they weigh</l>
     <l n="46">As virtue raiseth him above his clay .</l>
     <l n="47">Thus let us value things : and since we find</l>
     <l n="48">Time bend us toward death , let 's in our mind</l>
     <l n="49">Create new youth , and arm against the rude</l>
     <l n="50">Assaults of age ; that no dull solitude</l>
     <l n="51">O ’ the country dead our thoughts , nor busy care</l>
     <l n="52">O ’ the town make us to think , where now we are ,</l>
     <l n="53">And whither we are bound . Time ne'er forgot</l>

   <p>JOSEPH HALL , BISHOP OF NORWICH .</p>
   <p>This distinguished man must not be confounded with John Hall , of whom all we know is , that he was born at Durham in 1627 ,— that he was educated at Cambridge , where he published a volume of poems ,— that he practised at the bar , and that he died in 1656 , in his twenty-ninth year . One specimen of John 's verses we shall quote :—</p>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>THE MORNING STAR .</head>
     <l n="1">Still herald of the morn : whose ray</l>
     <l n="2">Being page and usher to the day ,</l>
     <l n="3">Doth mourn behind the sun , before him play ;</l>
     <l n="4">Who sett'st a golden signal ere</l>
     <l n="5">The dark retire , the lark appear ;</l>
     <l n="6">The early cooks cry comfort , screech-owls fear ;</l>
     <l n="7">Who wink'st while lovers plight their troth ,</l>
     <l n="8">Then falls asleep , while they are both</l>
     <l n="9">To part without a more engaging oath :</l>
     <l n="10">Steal in a message to the eyes</l>
     <l n="11">Of Julia ; tell her that she lies</l>
     <l n="12">Too long ; thy lord , the Sun , will quickly rise .</l>
     <l n="13">Yet it is midnight still with me ;</l>
     <l n="14">Nay , worse , unless that kinder she</l>
     <l n="15">Smile day , and in my zenith seated be ,</l>
     <l n="16">I needs a calenture must shun ,</l>
     <l n="17">And , like an Ethiopian , hate my sun .</l>

   <p>John 's more celebrated namesake , Joseph , was born at Bristowe Park , parish of Ashby-de-la-Zouch , Leicestershire , in 1574 . He studied and took orders at Cambridge . He acted for some time as master of the school of Tiverton , in Devonshire . It is said that the accidental preaching of a sermon before Prince Henry first attracted attention to this eminent divine . Promotion followed with a sure and steady course . He was chosen to accompany King James to Scotland as one of his chaplains , and subsequently attended the famous Synod of Dort as a representative of the English Church . He had before this , while quite a young man , ( in 1597 ,) published , under the title of ‘ Virgidemiarum , ’ his Satires . In the year 1600 he produced a satirical fiction , entitled , ‘ Mundus alter et idem ; ’ in which , while pretending to describe a certain terra australis incognita , he hits hard at the existent evils of the actual world . Hall was subsequently created Bishop of Exeter , where he exposed himself to obloquy by his mildness to the Puritans . ‘ Had , ’ Campbell justly remarked , ‘ such conduct been , at this critical period , pursued by the High Churchmen in general , the history of a bloody age might have been changed into that of peace ; but the violence of Laud prevailed over the milder counsels of a Hall , an Usher , and a Corbet . ’ Yet Hall was a zealous Episcopalian , and defended that form of government in a variety of pamphlets . In the course of this controversy he carne in collision with the mighty Milton himself , who , unable to deny the ability and learning of his opponent , tried to cover him with a deluge of derision .</p>
   <p>Besides these pamphlets , the Bishop produced a number of Epistles in prose , of Sermons , of Paraphrases , and a remarkable series of ‘ Occasional Meditations , ’ which became soon , and continue to be , popular .</p>
   <p>Hall , who had in his early days struggled hard with narrow circumstances and neglect , seemed to reach the climax of prosperity when he was , in 1641 , created by the King Bishop of Norwich . But having , soon after , unfortunately added his name to the Protest of the twelve prelates against the authority of any laws which should be passed during their compulsory absence from Parliament , he was thrown into the Tower , and subsequently threatened with sequestration . After enduring great privations , he at last was permitted to retire to Higham , near Norwich , where , reduced to a very miserable allowance , he continued to labour as a pastor , with unwearied assiduity , till , in 1656 , death closed his eyes , at the advanced age of eighty-two . Bishop Hall , if not fully competent to mate with Milton , was nevertheless a giant , conspicuous even in an age when giants were rife . He has been called the Christian Seneca , from the pith and clear sententiousness of his prose style . His ‘ Meditations , ’ ranging over almost the whole compass of Scripture , as well as an incredible variety of ordinary topics , are distinguished by their fertile fancy , their glowing language , and by thought which , if seldom profound , is never commonplace , and seems always the spontaneous and easy outcome of the author 's mind . In no form of composition does excellence depend more on spontaneity than in the meditation . The ruin of such writers as Hervey , and , to some extent , Boyle , has been , that they seem to have set themselves elaborately and convulsively to extract sentiment out of every object which met their eye . They seem to say , ‘ We will , and we must meditate , whether the objects be interesting or not , and whether our own moods be propitious to the exercise , or the reverse . ’ Hence have come exaggeration , extravagance , and that shape of the ridiculous which mimics the sublime , and has been so admirably exposed in Swift 's ‘ Meditation on a Broomstick . ’ Hall 's method is , in general , the opposite of this . The objects on which he muses seem to have sought him , and not he them . He surrounds himself with his thoughts unconsciously , as one gathers burs and other herbage about him by the mere act of walking in the woods . Sometimes , indeed , he is quaint and fantastic , as in his meditation</p>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>‘ UPON THE SIGHT OF TWO SNAILS . ’</head>
    <head>‘ There is much variety even in creatures of the same kind . See these two snails : one hath a house , the other wants it ; yet both are snails , and it is a question whether case is the better ; that which hath a house hath more shelter , but that which wants it hath more freedom ; the privilege of that cover is but a burden — you see if it hath but a stone to climb over with what stress it draws up that artificial load , and if the passage proves strait finds no entrance , whereas the empty snail makes no difference of way . Surely it is always an ease and sometimes a happiness to have nothing . No man is so worthy of envy as he that can be cheerful in want . ’</head>
     <l n="1">In a very different style he discourses</l>
   </lg>
   <p>‘ UPON HEARING OF MUSIC BY NIGHT . ’</p>
   <p>‘ How sweetly doth this music sound in this dead season ! In the daytime it would not , it could not so much affect the ear . All harmonious sounds are advanced by a silent darkness : thus it is with the glad tidings of salvation . The gospel never sounds so sweet as in the night of preservation or of our own private affliction — it is ever the same , the difference is in our disposition to receive it . O God , whose praise it is to give songs in the night , make my prosperity conscionable and my crosses cheerful ! ’</p>
   <p>Hall fulfilled one test of lofty genius : he was in several departments an originator . He first gave an example of epistolary composition in prose ,— an example the imitation of which has produced many of the most interesting , instructive , and beautiful writings in the language . He is our first popular author of Meditations and Contemplations , and a large school has followed in his path — too often , in truth , passibus iniquis . And he is unquestionably the father of British satire . It is remarkable that all his satires were written in youth . Too often the satirical spirit grows in authors with the advance of life ; and it is a pitiful sight , that of those who have passed the meridian of years and reputation , grinning back in helpless mockery and toothless laughter upon the brilliant way they have traversed , but to which they can return no more . Hall , on the other hand , exhausted long ere he was thirty the sarcastic material that was in him ; and during the rest of his career , wielded his powers with as much lenity as strength .</p>
   <p>Perhaps no satirist had a more thorough conception than our author of what is the real mission of satire in the moral history of mankind ; — that is , to shew vice its own image — to scourge impudent imposture — to expose hypocrisy — to laugh down solemn quackery of every kind — to create blushes on brazen brows and fears of scorn in hollow hearts — to make iniquity , as ashamed , hide its face — to apply caustic , nay cautery , to the sores of society — and to destroy sin by shewing both the ridicule which attaches to its progress and the wretched consequences which are its end . But various causes prevented him from fully realising his own ideal , and thus becoming the best as well as the first of our satirical poets . His style — imitated from Persius and Juvenal — is too elliptical , and it becomes true of him as well as of Persius that his points are often sheathed through the remoteness of his allusions and the perplexity of his diction . He is very recondite in his images , and you are sometimes reminded of one storming in English at a Hindoo — it is pointless fury , boltless thunder . At other times the stream of his satiric vein flows on with a blended clearness and energy , which has commanded the warm encomium of Campbell , and which prompted the diligent study of Pope . There is more courage required in attacking the follies than the vices of an age , and Hall shews a peculiar daring when he derides the vulgar forms of astrology and alchymy which were then prevalent , and the wretched fustian which infected the language both of literature and the stage . Whatever be the merits or defects of Hall 's satires , the world is indebted to him as the founder of a school which were itself sufficient to cover British literature with glory , and which , in the course of ages , has included such writers as Samuel Butler , with his keen sense of the grotesque and ridiculous — his wit , unequalled in its abundance and point — his vast assortment of ludicrous fancies and language — and his form of versification , seemingly shaped by the Genius of Satire for his own purposes , and resembling heroic rhyme broken off in the middle by shouts of laughter ;— Dryden , with the ease , the animus , and the masterly force of his satirical dissections — the vein of humour which is stealthily visible at times in the intervals of his wrathful mood — and the occasional passing and profound touches , worthy of Juvenal , and reminding one of the fires of Egypt , which ran along the ground , scorching all things while they pursued their unabated speed ;— the spirit of satire , strong as death , and cruel as the grave , which became incarnate in Swift ;— Pope , with his minute and microscopic vision of human infirmities , his polish , delicate strokes , damning hints , and annihilating whispers , where ‘ more is meant than meets the ear ; ’ — Johnson , with his crushing contempt and sacrificial dignity of scorn ; — Cowper , with the tenderness of a lover combined in his verse with the terrible indignation of an ancient prophet ;— Wolcot , with his infinite fund of coarse wit and humour ;— Burns , with that strange mixture of jaw and genius — the spirit of a caird with that of a poet — which marked all his satirical pieces ;— Crabbe , with his caustic vein and sternly-literal descriptions , behind which are seen , half-skulking from view , kindness , pity , and love ;— Byron , with the clever Billingsgate of his earlier , and the more than Swiftian ferocity of his later satires ;— and Moore , with the smartness , sparkle , tiny splendour , and minikin speed of his witty shafts . In comparison with even these masters of the art , the good Bishop does not dwindle ; and he challenges precedence over most of them in the purpose , tact , and good sense which blend with the whole of his satiric poetry .</p>

   <p>RICHARD LOVELACE .</p>
   <p>This unlucky cavalier and bard was born in 1618 . He was the son of Sir William Lovelace , of Woolwich , in Kent . He was educated some say at Oxford , and others at Cambridge — took a master 's degree , and was afterwards presented at Court . Anthony Wood thus describes his personal appearance at the age of sixteen :— ‘ He was the most amiable and beautiful person that eye ever beheld ,— a person also of innate modesty , virtue , and courtly deportment , which made him then , but especially after when he retired to the great city , much admired and adored by the fair sex . ’ Soon after this , he was chosen by the county of Kent to deliver a petition from the inhabitants to the House of Commons , praying them to restore the King to his rights , and to settle the government . Such offence was given by this to the Long Parliament , that Lovelace was thrown into prison , and only liberated on heavy bail . His paternal estate , which amounted to £ 500 a-year , was soon exhausted in his efforts to promote the royal cause . In 1646 , he formed a regiment for the service of the King of France , became its colonel , and was wounded at Dunkirk . Ere leaving England , he had formed a strong attachment to a Miss Lucy Sacheverell , and had written much poetry in her praise , designating her as Lux-Casta . Unfortunately , hearing a report that Lovelace had died at Dunkirk of his wounds , she married another , so that , on his return home in 1648 , he met a deep disappointment ; and to complete his misery , the ruling powers cast him again into prison , where he lay till the death of Charles . Like some other men of genius , he beguiled his confinement by literary employment ; and in 1649 , he published a book under the title of ‘ Lucasta , ’ consisting of odes , sonnets , songs , and miscellaneous poems , most of which had been previously composed . After the execution of the King , he was liberated ; but his funds were exhausted , his heart broken , and his constitution probably injured . He gradually sunk ; and Wood says that he became very poor in body and purse , was the object of charity , ‘ went in ragged clothes , and mostly lodged in obscure and dirty places . ’ Alas for the Adonis of sixteen , the beloved of Lucasta , and the envied of all ! Some have doubted these stories about his extreme poverty ; and one of his biographers asserts , that his daughter and sole heir ( but who , pray , was his wife and her mother ? ) married the son of Lord Chief-Justice Coke , and brought to her husband the estates of her father at Kingsdown , in Kent . Aubrey however , corroborates the statements of Wood ; and , at all events , Lovelace seems to have died , in 1658 , in a wretched alley near Shoe Lane .</p>
   <p>There is not much to be said about his poetry . It may be compared to his person — beautiful , but dressed in a stiff mode . We do not , in every point , homologate the opinions of Prynne , as to the ‘ unloveliness of love-locks ; ’ but we do certainly look with a mixture of contempt and pity on the self-imposed trammels of affectation in style and manner which bound many of the poets of that period . The wits of Charles II . were more disgustingly licentious ; but their very carelessness saved them from the conceits of their predecessors ; and , while lowering the tone of morality , they raised unwittingly the standard of taste . Some of the songs of Lovelace , however , such as ‘ To Althea , from Prison , ’ are exquisitely simple , as well as pure . Sir Egerton Brydges has found out that Byron , in one of his be-praised paradoxical beauties , either copied , or coincided with , our poet . In the ‘ Bride of Abydos ’ he says of Zuleika —</p>
   <p>‘ The mind , the music breathing from her face . ’</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Lovelace had , long before , in the song of ‘ Orpheus Mourning for his</l>
     <l n="2">Wife , ’ employed the words —</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">‘ Oh , could you view the melody</l>
     <l n="4">Of every grace ,</l>
     <l n="5">And music of her face ,</l>
     <l n="6">You 'd drop a tear ;</l>
     <l n="7">Seeing more harmony</l>
     <l n="8">In her bright eye</l>
     <l n="9">Than now you hear . ’</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>While many have praised , others have called this idea nonsense ; although , if we are permitted to speak of the harmony of the tones of a cloud , why not of the harmony produced by the consenting lines of a countenance , where every grace melts into another , and the various features and expressions fluctuate into a fine whole ? Whatever , whether it be the beauty of the human face , or the quiet lustre of statuary , or the mild glory of moonlight , gives the effects of music , and , like that divine art ,</p>
   <p>‘ Pours on mortals a beautiful disdain , ’</p>
   <p>may surely become music 's metaphor and poetic analogy .</p>

   <lg type="poem">
    <head>ROBERT HERRICK .</head>
    <head>This poet — a bird with tropical plumage , and norland sweetness of song — was born in Cheapside , London , in 1591 . His father , was an eminent goldsmith . Herrick was sent to Cambridge ; and having entered into holy orders , and being patronised by the Earl of Exeter , he was , in 1629 , presented by Charles I. to the vicarage of Dean Prior , in Devonshire . Here he resided for twenty years , till ejected by the civil war . He seems all this time to have felt little relish either for his profession or parishioners . In the former , the cast of his poems shews that he must have been ‘ detained before the Lord ; ’ and the latter he describes as a ‘ wild , amphibious race , ’ rude almost as ‘ salvages , ’ and ‘ churlish as the seas . ’ When he quitted his charge , he became an author at the mature age of fifty-six — publishing first , in 1647 , his ‘ Noble Numbers ; or , Pious Pieces ; ’ and next , in 1648 , his ‘ Hesperides ; or , Works both Human and Divine of Robert Herrick , Esq . ’ — his ministerial prefix being now laid aside . Some of these poems were sufficiently unclerical — being wild and licentious in cast — although he himself alleges that his life was , sexually at least , blameless . Till the Restoration he lived in Westminster , supported by the rich among the Royalists , and keeping company with the popular dramatists and poets . It would seem that he had been in the habit of visiting London previously , while still acting as a clergyman , and had become a boon companion of Ben Jonson . Hence his well-known lines —</head>
     <l n="1">‘ Ah , Ben !</l>
     <l n="2">Say how or when</l>
     <l n="3">Shall we , thy guests ,</l>
     <l n="4">Meet at those lyric feasts ,</l>
     <l n="5">Made at the “ Sun , ”</l>
     <l n="6">The “ Dog , ” the “ Triple Tun , ”</l>
     <l n="7">Where we such clusters had</l>
     <l n="8">As made us nobly wild , not mad ?</l>
     <l n="9">And yet each verse of thine</l>
     <l n="10">Outdid the meat , outdid the frolic wine .</l>
     <l n="11">My Ben !</l>
     <l n="12">Or come again ,</l>
     <l n="13">Or send to us ,</l>
     <l n="14">Thy wit 's great overplus .</l>
     <l n="15">But teach us yet</l>
     <l n="16">Wisely to husband it ;</l>
     <l n="17">Lest we that talent spend ,</l>
     <l n="18">And having once brought to an end</l>
     <l n="19">That precious stock , the store</l>
     <l n="20">Of such a wit , the world should have no more . ’</l>
   </lg>
   <p>With the Restoration , fortune began again to smile on our poet . He was replaced in his old charge , and seems to have spent the rest of his life quietly in the country , enjoying the fresh air and the old English sports — ‘ repenting at leisure moments , ’ as Shakspeare has it , of the early pruriencies of his muse ; or , as the same immortal bard says of Falstaff , ‘ patching up his old body ’ for a better place . The date of his death is not exactly ascertained ; but he seems to have got considerably to the shady side of seventy years of age .</p>
   <p>Herrick 's poetry was for a long time little known , till worthy Nathan Drake , in his ‘ Literary Hours , ’ performed to him , as to some others , the part of a friendly resurrectionist . He may be called the English Anacreon , and resembles the Greek poet , not only in graceful , lively , and voluptuous elegance and richness , but also in that deeper sentiment which often underlies the lighter surface of his verse . It is a great mistake to suppose that Anacreon was a mere contented sensualist and shallow songster of love and wine . Some of his odes shew that , if he yielded to the destiny of being a Cicada , singing amidst the vines of Bacchus , it was despair — the despair produced by a degraded age and a bad religion — which reduced him to the necessity . He was by nature an eagle ; but he was an eagle in a sky where there was no sun . The cry of a noble being , placed in the most untoward circumstances , is here and there heard in his verses , and reminds you of the voice of one of the transmuted victims of Circe , or of Ariel from that cloven pine , where he</p>
   <p>‘ howl 'd away twelve winters . ’</p>
   <p>Herrick might be by constitution a voluptuary ,— and he has unquestionably degraded his genius in not a few of his rhymes ,— but in him , as well as in Anacreon , Horace , and Burns , there lay a better and a higher nature , which the critics have ignored , because it has not found a frequent or full utterance in his poetry . In proof that our author possessed profound sentiment , mingling and sometimes half-lost in the loose , luxuriant leafage of his imagery , we need only refer our readers to his ‘ Blossoms ’ and his ‘ Daffodils . ’ Besides gaiety and gracefulness , his verse is exceedingly musical — his lines not only move but dance .</p>

    <head>SIR RICHARD FANSHAWE .</head>
    <head>This gallant knight was son to Sir Henry Fanshawe , who was Remembrancer to the Irish Exchequer , and brother to Thomas Lord Fanshawe . He was born at Ware , in Hertfordshire , in 1607-8 . He became a vehement Royalist , and acted for some time as Secretary to Prince Rupert , and was , in truth , a kindred spirit , worthy of recording the orders of that fiery spirit — the Murat of the Royal cause — to whom the dust of the mêlée of battle was the very breath of life . After the Restoration , Fanshawe was appointed ambassador to Spain and Portugal . He acted in this capacity at Madrid in 1666 . He had issued translations of the ‘ Lusiad ’ of Camoens , and the ‘ Pastor Fido ’ of Guarini . Along with the latter , which appeared in 1648 , he published some original poems of considerable merit . He holds altogether a respectable , if not a very high place among our early translators and minor poets .</head>

   <p>ABRAHAM COWLEY .</p>
   <p>The ‘ melancholy ’ and musical Cowley was born in London in the year 1618 . He was the posthumous son of a worthy grocer , who lived in Fleet Street , near the end of Chancery Lane , and who is supposed , from the omission of his name in the register of St Dunstan 's parish , to have been a Dissenter . His mother was left poor , but had a strong desire for her son 's education , and influence to get him admitted as a king 's scholar into Westminster . His mind was almost preternaturally precocious , and received early a strong and peculiar stimulus . A copy of Spenser lay in the window of his mother 's apartment , and in it he delighted to read , and became the devoted slave of poetry ever after . When only ten he wrote ‘ The Tragical History of Pyramus and Thisbe , ’ and at twelve ‘ Constantia and Philetus . ’ Pope wrote a lampoon about the same age as Cowley these romantic narratives ; and we have seen a pretty good copy of verses on Napoleon , written at the age of seven , by one of the most distinguished rising poets of our own day . When fifteen ( Johnson calls it thirteen , but he and some other biographers were misled by the portrait of the poet being , by mistake , marked thirteen ) Cowley published some of his early effusions , under the title of ‘ Poetical Blossoms . ’ While at school he produced a comedy of a pastoral kind , entitled , ‘ Love 's Riddle , ’ but it was not published till he went to Cambridge . To that university he proceeded in 1636 , and two years after , there appeared the above-mentioned comedy , with a poetical dedication to Sir Kenelm Digby , one of the marvellous men of that age ; and also ‘ Naufragium Joculare , ’ a comedy in Latin , inscribed to Dr Comber , master of the college . When the Prince of Wales afterwards visited Cambridge , the fertile Cowley got up the rough draft of another comedy , called ‘ The Guardian , ’ which was repeated to His Royal Highness by the scholars . This was afterwards , to the poet 's great annoyance , printed during his absence from the country . In 1643 he took his degree of A. M ., and was , the same year , through the prevailing influence of the Parliament , ejected , with many others , from Cambridge . He took refuge in St John 's College , Oxford , where he published a satire , entitled ‘ The Puritan and Papist , ’ and where , by his loyalty and genius , he gained the favour of such distinguished courtiers as Lord Falkland . During this agitated period he resided a good deal in the family of the Lord St Albans ; and when Oxford fell into the hands of the Parliament he followed the Queen to Paris , and there acted as Secretary to the same noble lord . He remained abroad about ten years , and during that period made various journeys in the furtherance of the Royal cause , visiting Flanders , Holland , Jersey , Scotland , &amp; c. His chief employment , however , was carrying on a correspondence in cipher between the King and the Queen . Sprat says , ‘ he ciphered and deciphered with his own hand the greatest part of the letters that passed between their Majesties , and managed a vast intelligence in other parts , which , for some years together , took up all his days and two or three nights every week . ’ This does not seem employment very suitable to a man of genius . He seems , however , to have found time for more congenial avocations ; and , in 1647 , he published his ‘ Mistress , ’ a work which seems to glow with amorous fire , although Barnes relates of the author that he was never in love but once , and then had not resolution to reveal his passion . And yet he wrote ‘ The Chronicle , ’ from which we might infer that his heart was completely tinder , and that his series of love attachments had been an infinite one !</p>
   <p>In 1556 , being of no more use in Paris , Cowley was sent back to England , that ‘ under pretence of privacy and retirement he might take occasion of giving notice of the posture of things in this nation . ’ For some time he lay concealed in London , but was at length seized by mistake for another gentleman of the Royal party ; and being thus discovered , he was continued in confinement , was several times examined , and ultimately succeeded , although with some difficulty , in obtaining his liberation , Dr Scarborough becoming his bail for a thousand pounds . In the same year he published a collection of his poems , with a querulous preface , in which he expresses a strong desire to ‘ retire to some of the American plantations , and to forsake the world for ever . ’ Meanwhile he gave himself out as a physician till the death of Cromwell , when he returned to France , resumed his former occupation , and remained till the Restoration . In 1657 he was created Doctor of Medicine at Oxford . Having studied botany to qualify himself for his physician 's degree , he was induced to publish in Latin some books on plants , flowers , and trees .</p>
   <p>The Restoration brought him less advantage than he had anticipated . Probably he expected too much , and had expressed his sanguine hopes in a song of triumph on the occasion . He had been promised , both by Charles I. and Charles II ., the Mastership of the Savoy , ( a forgotten sinecure office ;) but lost it , says Wood , ‘ by certain persons , enemies to the Muses . ’ He brought on the stage at this time his old comedy of ‘ The Guardian , ’ under the title of ‘ Cutter of Coleman Street ; ’ but it was thought a satire on the debauchery of the King 's party , and was received with coldness . Cowley , according to Dryden , ‘ received the news of his ill success not with so much firmness as might have been expected from so great a man . ’ There are few who , like Dr Johnson , have been able to declare , after the rejection of a play or poem , that they felt ‘ like the Monument . ’ Cowley not only entertained , but printed his dissatisfaction , in the form of a poem called ‘ The Complaint , ’ which , like all selfish complaints , attracted little sympathy or attention . In this he calls himself the ‘ melancholy Cowley , ’ an epithet which has stuck to his memory .</p>
   <p>He had always , according to his own statement , loved retirement . When he was a young boy at school , instead of running about on holidays , and playing with his fellows , he was wont to steal from them , and walk into the fields alone with a book . This passion had been overlaid , but not extinguished , during his public life ; and now , swelled by disgust , it came back upon him in great strength . He seems , too , if we can believe Sprat , to have had an extraordinary attachment to Nature , as it ‘ was God 's ; ’ to the whole ‘ compass of the creation , and all the wonderful effects of the Divine wisdom . ’ At all events , he retired first to Barn Elms , and then to Chertsey in Surrey . He had obtained , through Lord St Albans and the Duke of Buckingham , the lease of some lands belonging to the Queen , which brought him in an income of £ 300 a year . Here , then , having , at the age of forty-two , reached the peaceful hermitage , ’ he set himself with all his might to enjoy it . He cultivated his fields , and renewed his botanical studies in his woods and garden . He wrote letters to his friends , which are said to have been admirable , and might have ranked with those of Gray and Cowper , but unfortunately they have not been preserved . He renewed his intimacy with the Greek and Latin poets , and he set himself to retouch the ‘ Davideis , ’ which he had begun in early youth , but which he never lived to finish , and to compose his beautiful prose essays . But he soon found that Chertsey , no more than Paris , was Paradise . He had no wife nor children . He had sweet solitude , but no one near him to whom to whisper ‘ how sweet this solitude is ! ’ The peasants were boors . His tenants would pay him no rent , and the cattle of his neighbours devoured his meadows . He was troubled with rheums and colds . He met a severe fall when he first came to Chertsey , of which he says , half in jest and half in earnest — ‘ What this signifies , or may come to in time , God knows ; if it be ominous , it can end in nothing less than hanging . ’ Robert Hall said of Bishop Watson that he seemed to have wedded political integrity in early life , and to have spent all the rest of his days in quarrelling with his wife . So Cowley wedded his long - sought-for bride , Solitude , and led a miserable life with her ever after . Fortunately for him , if not for the world , his career soon came to a close .</p>
   <p>One hot day in summer , he stayed too long among his labourers in the meadows , and was seized with a cold , which , being neglected , carried him off on the 28th of July 1667 . He was not forty-nine years old . He died at the Porch House , Chertsey , and his remains were buried with great pomp near Chaucer and Spenser ; and King Charles , who had neglected him during life , pronounced his panegyric after death , declaring that ‘ Mr Cowley had not left behind him a better man in England . ’ It was in keeping with the character of Charles to make up for his deficiency in action , by his felicity of phrase .</p>
   <p>If we may differ from such a high authority as ‘ Old Rowley , ’ we would venture to doubt whether Cowley was the best — certainly he was not the greatest — man then in England . Milton was alive , and the ‘ Paradise Lost ’ appeared in the very year when the author of the ‘ Davideis ’ departed . Cowley gives us the impression of having been an amiable and blameless , rather than a good or great man . At all events , there was nothing active in his goodness , and his greatness could not be called magnanimity . He was a scholar and a poet misplaced during early life ; and when he gained that retirement for which he sighed , he had , by his habits of life , lost his capacity of relishing it . ‘ He that would enjoy solitude , ’ it has been said , ‘ must either be a wild beast or a god ; ’ and Cowley was neither . How different his grounds of dissatisfaction with the world from those of Milton ! Cowley was wearied of ciphering , and his ‘ Cutter of Coleman Street ’ had been cut ; that was nearly the whole matter of his complaint ; while Milton had fallen from being the second man in England into poverty , blindness , contempt , danger , and the disappointment of the most glorious hopes which ever heaved the bosom of patriot or saint .</p>
   <p>We find the want of greatness which marked the man characterising the poet . Infinite ingenuity , a charming flexibility and abundance of fancy , a perception of remote analogies almost unrivalled , great command of versification and language , learning without bounds , and an occasional gracefulness and sparkling ease ( as in ‘ The Chronicle ’ ) superior to even Herrick or Suckling , are qualities that must be conceded to Cowley . But the most of his writings are cold and glittering as the sun-smitten glacier . He is seldom warm , except when he is proclaiming his own merits , or bewailing his own misfortunes . Hence his ‘ Wish , ’ and even his ‘ Complaint , ’ are very pleasing and natural specimens of poetry . But his ‘ Pindaric Odes , ’ his ‘ Hymn to Light , ’ and most of his ‘ Davideis , ’ while displaying great power , shew at least equal perversion , and are more memorable for their faults than for their beauties . In the ‘ Davideis , ’ he describes the attire of Gabriel in the spirit and language of a tailor ; and there is no path so sacred or so lofty but he must sow it with conceits ,— forced , false , and chilly . His ‘ Anacreontics , ’ on the other hand , are in general felicitous in style and aerial in motion . And in his Translations , although too free , he is uniformly graceful and spirited ; and his vast command of language and imagery enables him often to improve his author — to gild the refined gold , to paint the lily , and to throw a new perfume on the violet , of the Grecian and Roman masters .</p>
   <p>In prose , Cowley is uniformly excellent . The prefaces to his poems , especially his defence of sacred song in the prefix to the ‘ Davideis , ’ his short autobiography , the fragments of his letters which remain , and his posthumous essays , are all distinguished by a rich simplicity of style and by a copiousness of matter which excite in equal measure delight and surprise . He had written , it appears , three books on the Civil War , to the time of the battle of Newbury , which he destroyed . It is a pity , perhaps , that he had not preserved and completed the work . His intimacy with many of the leading characters and the secret springs of that remarkable period ,— his clear and solid judgment , always so except when he was following the Daedalus Pindar upon waxen Icarian wings , or competing with Dr Donne in the number of conceits which he could stuff , like cloves , into his subject-matter ,— and the bewitching ease and elegance of his prose style , would have combined to render it an important contribution to English history , and a worthy monument of its author 's highly-accomplished and diversified powers .</p>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">But now the early birds began to call</l>
     <l n="2">The morning forth ; up rose the sun and Saul :</l>
     <l n="3">Both , as men thought , rose fresh from sweet repose ;</l>
     <l n="4">But both , alas ! from restless labours rose :</l>
     <l n="5">For in Saul 's breast Envy , the toilsome sin ,</l>
     <l n="6">Had all that night active and tyrannous been :</l>
     <l n="7">She expelled all forms of kindness , virtue , grace ,</l>
     <l n="8">Of the past day no footstep left , or trace ;</l>
     <l n="9">The new-blown sparks of his old rage appear ,</l>
     <l n="10">Nor could his love dwell longer with his fear .</l>
     <l n="11">So near a storm wise David would not stay ,</l>
     <l n="12">Nor trust the glittering of a faithless day :</l>
     <l n="13">He saw the sun call in his beams apace ,</l>
     <l n="14">And angry clouds march up into their place :</l>
     <l n="15">The sea itself smooths his rough brow awhile ,</l>
     <l n="16">Flatt'ring the greedy merchant with a smile ;</l>
     <l n="17">But he whose shipwrecked bark it drank before ,</l>
     <l n="18">Sees the deceit , and knows it would have more .</l>
     <l n="19">Such is the sea , and such was Saul ;</l>
     <l n="20">But Jonathan his son , and only good ,</l>
     <l n="21">Was gentle as fair Jordan 's useful flood ;</l>
     <l n="22">Whose innocent stream , as it in silence goes ,</l>
     <l n="23">Fresh honours and a sudden spring bestows</l>
     <l n="24">On both his banks , to every flower and tree ;</l>
     <l n="25">The manner how lies hid , the effect we see :</l>
     <l n="26">But more than all , more than himself , he loved</l>
     <l n="27">The man whose worth his father 's hatred moved ;</l>
     <l n="28">For when the noble youth at Dammin stood ,</l>
     <l n="29">Adorned with sweat , and painted gay with blood ,</l>
     <l n="30">Jonathan pierced him through with greedy eye ,</l>
     <l n="31">And understood the future majesty</l>
     <l n="32">Then destined in the glories of his look :</l>
     <l n="33">He saw , and straight was with amazement strook ,</l>
     <l n="34">To see the strength , the feature , and the grace</l>
     <l n="35">Of his young limbs ; he saw his comely face ,</l>
     <l n="36">Where love and reverence so well-mingled were ,</l>
     <l n="37">And head , already crowned with golden hair :</l>
     <l n="38">He saw what mildness his bold sp'rit did tame ,</l>

   <p>GEORGE WITHER</p>
   <p>This remarkable man was born in Hampshire , at Bentworth , near Alton , in 1588 . He was sent to Magdalene College , Oxford , but had hardly been there till his father remanded him home to hold the plough — a reversal of the case of Cincinnatus which did not please the aspiring spirit of our poet . He took an early opportunity of breaking loose from this occupation , and of going to London with the romantic intention of making his fortune at Court . Finding that to rise at Court , flattery was indispensable , and determined not to flatter , he , in 1613 , published his ‘ Abuses Whipt and Stript , ’ for which he was committed for some months to the Marshalsea . Here he wrote his beautiful poem , ‘ The Shepherd 's Hunting ; ’ and is said to have gained his manumission by a satire to the King , in which he defends his former writings . Soon after his liberation , he published his ‘ Hymns and Songs of the Church , ’ a book which embroiled him with the clergy , but procured him the favour of King James , who encouraged him to finish a translation of the Psalms . He travelled to the court of the Queen of Bohemia , ( James 's daughter ,) in fulfilment of a vow , and presented her with a copy of his completed translation .</p>
   <p>In 1639 , he was a captain of horse in the expedition against the Scotch . When the Civil War broke out , he sold his estate to raise a troop of horse on the Parliamentary side , and soon after was made a major . In 1642 , he was appointed captain and commander of Farnham Castle , in Surrey ; but owing to some neglect or cowardice on his part , it was ceded the same year to Sir William Waller . He was made prisoner by the Royalists some time after this , and would have been put to death had not Denham interfered , alleging that as long as Wither survived , he ( Denham ) could not be accounted the worst poet in England . He was afterwards appointed Cromwell 's major-general of all the horse and foot in the county of Surrey . He made money at this time by Royalist sequestrations , but lost it all at the Restoration . He had , on the death of Cromwell , hailed Richard with enthusiasm , and predicted him a happy reign ; which makes Campbell remark , ‘ He never but once in his life foreboded good , and in that prophecy he was mistaken . ’ Wither was by no means pleased with the loss of his fortune , and remonstrated bitterly ; but for so doing he was thrown into prison again . Here his mind continued as active as ever , and he poured out treatises , poems , and satires — sometimes , when pen and ink were denied him , inscribing his thoughts with red ochre upon a trencher . After three years , he was , in 1663 , released from Newgate , under bond for good behaviour ; and four years afterwards he died in London . This was on the 2d of May 1667 . He was buried between the east door and the south end of the Savoy church , in the Strand .</p>
   <p>Wither was a man of real genius , but seems to have been partially insane . His political zeal was a frenzy ; and his religion was deeply tinged with puritanic gloom . His ‘ Collection of Emblems ’ never became so popular as those of Quarles , and are now nearly as much forgotten as his satires , his psalms , and his controversial treatises . But his early poems are delightful — full of elegant and playful fancy , ease of language , and delicacy of sentiment . Some passages in ‘ The Shepherd 's Hunting , ’ and in the ‘ Address to Poetry , ’ resemble the style of Milton in his ‘ L'Allegro ’ and ‘ Penseroso . ’ His ‘ Christmas ’ catches the full spirit of that joyous carnival of Christian England . Altogether , it is refreshing to turn from the gnarled oak of Wither 's struggling and unhappy life , to the beautiful flowers , nodding over it , of his poesy .</p>

     <l n="34">For thy pace she flags too low .</l>
     <l n="35">Yes , the more 's her hapless fate ,</l>
     <l n="36">Her short wings were clipped of late ;</l>
     <l n="37">And poor I , her fortune ruing ,</l>
     <l n="38">Am myself put up a-muing .</l>
     <l n="39">But if I my cage can rid ,</l>
     <l n="40">I 'll fly where I never did .</l>
     <l n="41">And though for her sake I 'm cross 'd ,</l>
     <l n="42">Though my best hopes I have lost ,</l>
     <l n="43">And knew she would make my trouble</l>
     <l n="44">Ten times more than ten times double ;</l>
     <l n="45">I would love and keep her too ,</l>
     <l n="46">Spite of all the world could do .</l>
     <l n="47">For though banished from my flocks ,</l>
     <l n="48">And confined within these rocks ,</l>
     <l n="49">Here I waste away the light ,</l>

     <l n="52">And keeps many cares away .</l>
     <l n="53">Though I miss the flowery fields ,</l>
     <l n="54">With those sweets the springtide yields ;</l>
     <l n="55">Though I may not see those groves ,</l>
     <l n="56">Where the shepherds chant their loves ,</l>
     <l n="57">And the lasses more excel</l>

     <l n="60">Nothing now remains at last ,</l>

     <l n="87">By her help I also now</l>
     <l n="88">Make this churlish place allow</l>
     <l n="89">Some things that may sweeten gladness</l>
     <l n="90">In the very gall of sadness :</l>
     <l n="91">The dull loneness , the black shade</l>
     <l n="92">That these hanging vaults have made ,</l>
     <l n="93">The strange music of the waves ,</l>
     <l n="94">Beating on these hollow caves ,</l>
     <l n="95">This black den , which rocks emboss ,</l>
     <l n="96">Overgrown with eldest moss ;</l>
     <l n="97">The rude portals , that give light</l>
     <l n="98">More to terror than delight ,</l>
     <l n="99">This my chamber of neglect ,</l>
     <l n="100">Walled about with disrespect ,</l>

     <l n="1">My friends , I will ; you know I am a swain ,</l>
     <l n="2">That keep a poor flock here upon this plain :</l>
     <l n="3">Who , though it seems I could do nothing less ,</l>
     <l n="4">Can make a song , and woo a shepherdess ;</l>
     <l n="5">And not alone the fairest where I live</l>
     <l n="6">Have heard me sing , and favours deigned to give ;</l>
     <l n="7">But though I say't , the noblest nymph of Thame ,</l>
     <l n="8">Hath graced my verse unto my greater fame .</l>
     <l n="9">Yet being young , and not much seeking praise ,</l>
     <l n="10">I was not noted out for shepherds ’ lays ,</l>
     <l n="11">Nor feeding flocks , as you know others be :</l>
     <l n="12">For the delight that most possessed me</l>
     <l n="13">Was hunting foxes , wolves , and beasts of prey ;</l>
     <l n="14">That spoil our folds , and bear our lambs away .</l>
     <l n="15">For this , as also for the love I bear</l>
     <l n="16">Unto my country , I laid by all care</l>
     <l n="17">Of gain , or of preferment , with desire</l>
     <l n="18">Only to keep that state I had entire ,</l>
     <l n="19">And like a true-grown huntsman sought to speed</l>
     <l n="20">Myself with hounds of rare and choicest breed ,</l>
     <l n="21">Whose names and natures ere I further go ,</l>
     <l n="22">Because you are my friends , I 'll let you know .</l>
     <l n="23">My first esteemed dog that I did find ,</l>
     <l n="24">Was by descent of old Actaeon 's kind ;</l>
     <l n="25">A brach , which if I do not aim amiss ,</l>
     <l n="26">For all the world is just like one of his :</l>
     <l n="27">She 's named Love , and scarce yet knows her duty ;</l>
     <l n="28">Her dam 's my lady 's pretty beagle Beauty ,</l>
     <l n="29">I bred her up myself with wondrous charge ,</l>
     <l n="30">Until she grew to be exceeding large ,</l>
     <l n="31">And waxed so wanton that I did abhor it ,</l>
     <l n="32">And put her out amongst my neighbours for it .</l>
     <l n="33">The next is Lust , a hound that 's kept abroad ,</l>
     <l n="34">‘ Mongst some of mine acquaintance , but a toad</l>
     <l n="35">Is not more loathsome : ‘ tis a cur will range</l>
     <l n="36">Extremely , and is ever full of mange ;</l>
     <l n="37">And ‘ cause it is infectious , she 's not wont</l>
     <l n="38">To come among the rest , but when they hunt .</l>
     <l n="39">Hate is the third , a hound both deep and long .</l>
     <l n="40">His sire is true or else supposed Wrong .</l>
     <l n="41">He 'll have a snap at all that pass him by ,</l>
     <l n="42">And yet pursues his game most eagerly .</l>
     <l n="43">With him goes Envy coupled , a lean cur ,</l>
     <l n="44">And she 'll hold out , hunt we ne'er so far :</l>
     <l n="45">She pineth much , and feedeth little too ,</l>
     <l n="46">Yet stands and snarleth at the rest that do .</l>
     <l n="47">Then there 's Revenge , a wondrous deep-mouthed dog ,</l>
     <l n="48">So fleet , I 'm fain to hunt him with a clog ,</l>
     <l n="49">Yet many times he 'll much outstrip his bounds ,</l>
     <l n="50">And hunts not closely with the other hounds :</l>
     <l n="51">He 'll venture on a lion in his ire ;</l>
     <l n="52">Curst Choler was his dam , and Wrong his sire .</l>
     <l n="53">This Choler is a brach that 's very old ,</l>
     <l n="54">And spends her mouth too much to have it hold :</l>
     <l n="55">She 's very testy , an unpleasing cur ,</l>
     <l n="56">That bites the very stones , if they but stur :</l>
     <l n="57">Or when that ought but her displeasure moves ,</l>
     <l n="58">She 'll bite and snap at any one she loves :</l>
     <l n="59">But my quick-scented'st dog is Jealousy ,</l>
     <l n="60">The truest of this breed 's in Italy :</l>
     <l n="61">The dam of mine would hardly fill a glove ,</l>
     <l n="62">It was a lady 's little dog , called Love :</l>
     <l n="63">The sire , a poor deformed cur , named Fear ,</l>
     <l n="64">As shagged and as rough as is a bear :</l>
     <l n="65">And yet the whelp turned after neither kind ,</l>
     <l n="66">For he is very large , and near-hand blind ;</l>
     <l n="67">At the first sight he hath a pretty colour ,</l>
     <l n="68">But doth not seem so , when you view him fuller ;</l>
     <l n="69">A vile suspicious beast , his looks are bad ,</l>
     <l n="70">And I do fear in time he will grow mad .</l>
     <l n="71">To him I couple Avarice , still poor ;</l>
     <l n="72">Yet she devours as much as twenty more :</l>
     <l n="73">A thousand horse she in her paunch can put ,</l>
     <l n="74">Yet whine as if she had an empty gut :</l>
     <l n="75">And having gorged what might a land have found ,</l>
     <l n="76">She 'll catch for more , and hide it in the ground .</l>
     <l n="77">Ambition is a hound as greedy full ;</l>
     <l n="78">But he for all the daintiest bits doth cull :</l>
     <l n="79">He scorns to lick up crumbs beneath the table ,</l>
     <l n="80">He 'll fetch ‘ t from boards and shelves , if he be able :</l>
     <l n="81">Nay , he can climb if need be ; and for that ,</l>
     <l n="82">With him I hunt the martin and the cat :</l>
     <l n="83">And yet sometimes in mounting he 's so quick ,</l>
     <l n="84">He fetches falls are like to break his neck .</l>
     <l n="85">Fear is well-mouth 'd , but subject to distrust ;</l>
     <l n="86">A stranger cannot make him take a crust :</l>
     <l n="87">A little thing will soon his courage quail ,</l>
     <l n="88">And ‘ twixt his legs he ever claps his tail ;</l>
     <l n="89">With him Despair now often coupled goes ,</l>
     <l n="90">Which by his roaring mouth each huntsman knows .</l>
     <l n="91">None hath a better mind unto the game ,</l>
     <l n="92">But he gives off , and always seemeth lame .</l>
     <l n="93">My bloodhound Cruelty , as swift as wind ,</l>
     <l n="94">Hunts to the death , and never comes behind ;</l>
     <l n="95">Who but she 's strapp 'd and muzzled too withal ,</l>
     <l n="96">Would eat her fellows , and the prey and all ;</l>
     <l n="97">And yet she cares not much for any food ,</l>
     <l n="98">Unless it be the purest harmless blood .</l>
     <l n="99">All these are kept abroad at charge of many ,</l>
     <l n="100">They do not cost me in a year a penny .</l>
     <l n="101">But there 's two couple of a middling size ,</l>
     <l n="102">That seldom pass the sight of my own eyes .</l>
     <l n="103">Hope , on whose head I 've laid my life to pawn ;</l>
     <l n="104">Compassion , that on every one will fawn .</l>
     <l n="105">This would , when ‘ twas a whelp , with rabbits play</l>
     <l n="106">Or lambs , and let them go unhurt away :</l>
     <l n="107">Nay , now she is of growth , she 'll now and then</l>
     <l n="108">Catch you a hare , and let her go again .</l>
     <l n="109">The two last , Joy and Sorrow , ‘ tis a wonder ,</l>
     <l n="110">Can ne'er agree , nor ne'er bide far asunder .</l>
     <l n="111">Joy 's ever wanton , and no order knows :</l>
     <l n="112">She 'll run at larks , or stand and bark at crows .</l>
     <l n="113">Sorrow goes by her , and ne'er moves his eye ;</l>
     <l n="114">Yet both do serve to help make up the cry .</l>
     <l n="115">Then comes behind all these to bear the base ,</l>
     <l n="116">Two couple more of a far larger race ,</l>
     <l n="117">Such wide-mouth 'd trollops , that ‘ twould do you good</l>
     <l n="118">To hear their loud loud echoes tear the wood .</l>
     <l n="119">There 's Vanity , who , by her gaudy hide ,</l>
     <l n="120">May far away from all the rest be spied ,</l>
     <l n="121">Though huge , yet quick , for she 's now here , now there ;</l>
     <l n="122">Nay , look about you , and she 's everywhere :</l>
     <l n="123">Yet ever with the rest , and still in chase .</l>
     <l n="124">Right so , Inconstancy fills every place ;</l>
     <l n="125">And yet so strange a fickle-natured hound ,</l>
     <l n="126">Look for her , and she 's nowhere to be found .</l>
     <l n="127">Weakness is no fair dog unto the eye ,</l>
     <l n="128">And yet she hath her proper quality ;</l>
     <l n="129">But there 's Presumption , when he heat hath got ,</l>
     <l n="130">He drowns the thunder and the cannon-shot :</l>
     <l n="131">And when at start he his full roaring makes ,</l>
     <l n="132">The earth doth tremble , and the heaven shakes .</l>
     <l n="133">These were my dogs , ten couple just in all ,</l>
     <l n="134">Whom by the name of Satyrs I do call :</l>
     <l n="135">Mad curs they be , and I can ne'er come nigh them ,</l>
     <l n="136">But I 'm in danger to be bitten by them .</l>
     <l n="137">Much pains I took , and spent days not a few ,</l>
     <l n="138">To make them keep together , and hunt true :</l>
     <l n="139">Which yet I do suppose had never been ,</l>
     <l n="140">But that I had a scourge to keep them in .</l>
     <l n="141">Now when that I this kennel first had got ,</l>
     <l n="142">Out of my own demesnes I hunted not ,</l>
     <l n="143">Save on these downs , or among yonder rocks ,</l>
     <l n="144">After those beasts that spoiled our parish flocks ;</l>
     <l n="145">Nor during that time was I ever wont</l>

    <head>SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT ,</head>
    <head>The author of ‘ Gondibert , ’ was the son of a vintner in Oxford , and born in February 1605 . Gossip says — but says with her usual carelessness about truth — that he was the son of no less a person than William Shakspeare , who used , in his journeys between London and Stratford , to stop at the Crown , an inn kept by Davenant 's reputed father . This story is hinted at by Wood , was told to Pope by Betterton the player , and believed by Malone , but seems to be a piece of mere scandal . It is true that Davenant had a great veneration for Shakspeare , and expressed it , when only ten years old , in lines ‘ In remembrance of Master William Shakspeare , ’ beginning thus :—</head>
     <l n="1">‘ Beware , delighted poets , when you sing ,</l>
     <l n="2">To welcome nature in the early spring ,</l>
     <l n="3">Your numerous feet not tread</l>
     <l n="4">The banks of Avon , for each flower</l>
     <l n="5">( As it ne'er knew a sun or shower )</l>
     <l n="6">Hangs there the pensive head . ’</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Southey says — ‘ The father was a man of melancholy temperament , the mother handsome and lively ; and as Shakspeare used to put up at the house on his journeys between Stratford and London , Davenant is said to have affected the reputation of being Shakspeare 's son . If he really did this , there was a levity , or rather a want of feeling , in the boast , for which social pleasantry , and the spirits which are induced by wine , afford but little excuse . ’</p>
   <p>He was entered at Lincoln College ; he next became page to the Duchess of Richmond ; and we find him afterwards in the family of Fulk Greville , Lord Brooke — famous as the friend of Sir Philip Sidney . He began to write for the stage in 1628 ; and on the death of Ben Jonson he was made Poet Laureate — to the disappointment of Thomas May , so much praised by Johnson and others for his proficiency in Latin poetry , as displayed in his supplement to Lucan 's ‘ Pharsalia . ’ He became afterwards manager of Drury Lane ; but owing to his connexion with the intrigues of that unhappy period , he was imprisoned in the Tower , and subsequently made his escape to France . On his return to England , he distinguished himself greatly in the Royal cause ; and when that became desperate , he again took refuge in France , and wrote part of his ‘ Gondibert . ’ He projected a scheme for carrying over a colony to Virginia ; but his vessel was seized by one of the Parliamentary ships — he himself was conveyed a prisoner to Cowes Castle , in the Isle of Wight , and thence to the Tower , preparatory to being tried by the High Commission . But a giant hand , worthy of having saved him had he been Shakspeare 's veritable son , was now stretched forth to his rescue — the hand of Milton . In this generous act Milton was seconded by Whitelocke , and by two aldermen of York , to whom our poet had rendered some services . Liberated from the Tower , Davenant was also permitted , through the influence of Whitelocke , to open , in defiance of Puritanic prohibition , a kind of theatre at Rutland House , and by enacting his own plays there , he managed to support himself till the Restoration . He then , it is supposed , repaid to Milton his friendly service , and shielded him from the wrath of the Court . From this period Davenant continued to write for the stage — having received the patent of the Duke 's Theatre , in Lincoln 's Inn — till his death . This event took place on April 7 , 1668 . His last play , written in conjunction with Dryden , was an alteration and pollution of Shakspeare 's ‘ Tempest , ’ which was more worthy of Trincula than of the authors of ‘ Absalom and Ahithophel ’ and of ‘ Gondibert . ’ Supposing Davenant the son of Shakspeare , his act to his father 's masterpiece reminds us , in the excess of its filial impiety , of Ham 's conduct to Noah .</p>
   <p>‘ Gondibert ’ is a large and able , without being a great poem . It has the incurable and indefensible defect of dulness . ‘ The line labours , and the words move slow . ’ The story is interesting of itself , but is lost in the labyrinthine details . It has many lines , and some highly and successfully wrought passages ; but as a whole we may say of it as Porson said of certain better productions , ‘ It will be read when the works of Homer and Virgil are forgotten — but not till then . ’</p>

   <p>JOHN CHALKHILL .</p>
   <p>This author was of the age of Spenser , and is said to have been an acquaintance and friend of that poet . It was not , however , till 1683 that good old Izaak Walton published ‘ Thealma and Clearchus , ’ a pas - toral romance , which , he stated , had been written long since by John Chalkhill , Esq . He says of the author , ‘ that he was in his time a man generally known , and as well beloved ; for he was humble and obliging in his behaviour — a gentleman , a scholar , very innocent and prudent , and indeed his whole life was useful , quiet , and virtuous . ’ Some have suspected that this production proceeded from the pen of Walton himself . This , however , is rendered extremely unlikely — first , by the fact that Walton , when he printed ‘ Thealma , ’ was ninety years of age ; and , secondly , by the difference in style and purpose between that poem and Walton 's avowed productions . The mind of Walton was quietly ingenious ; that of the author of ‘ Thealma ’ is adventurous and fantastic . Walton loved ‘ the green pastures and the still waters ’ of the Present ; the other , the golden groves and ideal wildernesses of the Golden Age in the Past .</p>
   <p>‘ Thealma and Clearchus ’ may be called an ‘ Arcadia ’ in rhyme . It resembles that work of Sir Philip Sidney , not only in subject , but in execution . Its plot is dark and puzzling , its descriptions are rich to luxuriance , its narrative is tedious , and its characters are mere shadows . But although a dream , it is a dream of genius , and brings beautifully before our imagination that early period in the world 's history , in which poets and painters have taught us to believe , when the heavens were nearer , the skies clearer , the fat of the earth richer , the foam of the sea brighter , than in our degenerate days ;— when shepherds , reposing under broad , umbrageous oaks , saw , or thought they saw , in the groves the shadow of angels , and on the mountain-summits the descending footsteps of God . Chalkhill resembles , of all our modern poets , perhaps Shelley most , in the ideality of his conception , the enthusiasm of his spirit , and the unmitigated gorgeousness of his imagination .</p>

     <l n="9">O'er his own family ; the jars that rose</l>
     <l n="10">Were soon appeased by such grave men as those :</l>
     <l n="11">This mine and thine , that we so cavil for ,</l>
     <l n="12">Was then not heard of ; he that was most poor</l>
     <l n="13">Was rich in his content , and lived as free</l>
     <l n="14">As they whose flocks were greatest ; nor did he</l>
     <l n="15">Envy his great abundance , nor the other</l>
     <l n="16">Disdain the low condition of his brother ,</l>
     <l n="17">But lent him from his store to mend his state ,</l>
     <l n="18">And with his love he quits him , thanks his fate ;</l>
     <l n="19">And , taught by his example , seeks out such</l>
     <l n="20">As want his help , that they may do as much .</l>
     <l n="21">Their laws , e'en from their childhood , rich and poor</l>
     <l n="22">Had written in their hearts , by conning o'er</l>
     <l n="23">The legacies of good old men , whose memories</l>
     <l n="24">Outlive their monuments , the grave advice</l>
     <l n="25">They left behind in writing ;— this was that</l>
     <l n="26">That made Arcadia then so blest a state ;</l>
     <l n="27">Their wholesome laws had linked them so in one ,</l>
     <l n="28">They lived in peace and sweet communion .</l>
     <l n="29">Peace brought forth plenty , plenty bred content ,</l>
     <l n="30">And that crowned all their plans with merriment .</l>
     <l n="31">They had no foe , secure they lived in tents ,</l>
     <l n="32">All was their own they had , they paid no rents ;</l>
     <l n="33">Their sheep found clothing , earth provided food ,</l>
     <l n="34">And labour dressed them as their wills thought good ;</l>
     <l n="35">On unbought delicates their hunger fed ,</l>
     <l n="36">And for their drink the swelling clusters bled ;</l>
     <l n="37">The valleys rang with their delicious strains ,</l>
     <l n="38">And pleasure revelled on those happy plains ;</l>
     <l n="39">Content and labour gave them length of days ,</l>
     <l n="40">And peace served in delight a thousand ways .</l>

     <l n="1">Down in a gloomy valley , thick with shade ,</l>

     <l n="4">From prying into the actions there done ;</l>
     <l n="5">Set full of box and cypress , poplar , yew ,</l>
     <l n="6">And hateful elder that in thickets grew ,</l>
     <l n="7">Among whose boughs the screech-owl and night-crow</l>
     <l n="8">Sadly recount their prophecies of woe ,</l>
     <l n="9">Where leather-winged bats , that hate the light ,</l>
     <l n="10">Fan the thick air , more sooty than the night .</l>
     <l n="11">The ground o'ergrown with weeds and bushy shrubs ,</l>
     <l n="12">Where milky hedgehogs nurse their prickly cubs :</l>

     <l n="21">To hinder him , sending her airy spies</l>
     <l n="22">Forth with delusion to entrap his eyes ,</l>
     <l n="23">As would have fired a hermit 's chill desires</l>
     <l n="24">Into a flame ; his greedy eye admires</l>
     <l n="25">The more than human beauty of her face ,</l>
     <l n="26">And much ado he had to shun the grace ;</l>
     <l n="27">Conceit had shaped her out so like his love ,</l>

     <l n="38">Betid his master ; they were newly sate</l>
     <l n="39">When his approach disturbed them ; up she rose ,</l>
     <l n="40">And toward Anaxus ( envious hag ) she goes ;</l>
     <l n="41">Pandevius she had charmed into a maze ,</l>
     <l n="42">And struck him mute , all he could do was gaze .</l>

     <l n="44">Echo returns ‘ Pandevius ’ back again ;</l>
     <l n="45">Which made him wonder , when a sudden fear</l>
     <l n="46">Shook all his joints : she , cunning hag , drew near ,</l>
     <l n="47">And smelling to his herb , he recollects</l>
     <l n="48">His wandering spirits , and with anger checks</l>

   <p>CATHARINE PHILLIPS .</p>
   <p>Very little is known of the life of this lady-poet . She was born in 1631 . Her maiden name was Fowler . She married James Phillips , Esq ., of the Priory of Cardigan . Her poems , published under the name of “ Orinda , ” were very popular in her lifetime , although it was said they were published without her consent . She translated two of the tragedies of Corneille , and left a volume of letters to Sir Charles Cotterell . These , however , did not appear till after her death . She died of small-pox — then a deadly disease — in 1664 . She seems to have been a favourite alike with the wits and the divines of her age . Jeremy Taylor addressed to her his “ Measures and Offices of Friendship ; ” Dryden praised her ; and Flatman and Cowley , besides imitating her poems while she was living , paid rhymed tributes to her memory when dead . Her verses are never commonplace , and always sensible , if they hardly attain to the measure and the stature of lofty poetry ,</p>

   <p>MARGARET , DUCHESS OF NEWCASTLE .</p>
   <p>This lady , if not more of a woman than Mrs Phillips , was considerably more of a poet . She was born ( probably ) about 1625 . She was the daughter of Sir Charles Lucas , and became a maid-of-honour to Henrietta Maria . Accompanying the Queen to France , she met with the Marquis , afterwards Duke of Newcastle , and married him at Paris in 1645 . They removed to Antwerp , and there , in 1653 , this lady published a volume , entitled ‘ Poems and Fancies . ’ The pair aided each other in their studies , and the result was a number of enormous folios of poems , plays , speeches , and philosophical disquisitions . These volumes were , we are told , great favourites of Coleridge and Charles Lamb , for the sake , we presume , of the wild sparks of insight and genius which break irresistibly through the scholastic smoke and bewildered nonsense . When Charles II . was restored , the Marquis and his wife returned to England , and spent their life in great harmony . She died in 1673 , leaving behind her some beautiful fantasias , where the meaning is often finer than the music , such as the ‘ Pastime and Recreation of Fairies in Fairy-land . ’ Her poetry , particularly her contrasted pictures of Mirth and Melancholy , present fine accumulations of imagery drawn direct from nature , and shewn now in brightest sunshine , and now in softest moonlight , as the change of her subject and her tone of feeling require .</p>

    <head>MELANCHOLY DESCRIBED BY MIRTH .</head>
     <l n="1">Her voice is low , and gives a hollow sound ;</l>
     <l n="2">She hates the light , and is in darkness found ;</l>
     <l n="3">Or sits with blinking lamps , or tapers small ,</l>
     <l n="4">Which various shadows make against the wall .</l>
     <l n="5">She loves nought else but noise which discord makes ,</l>
     <l n="6">As croaking frogs , whose dwelling is in lakes ;</l>
     <l n="7">The raven 's hoarse , the mandrake 's hollow groan ,</l>
     <l n="8">And shrieking owls which fly i ’ the night alone ;</l>
     <l n="9">The tolling bell , which for the dead rings out ;</l>
     <l n="10">A mill , where rushing waters run about ;</l>
     <l n="11">The roaring winds , which shake the cedars tall ,</l>
     <l n="12">Plough up the seas , and beat the rocks withal .</l>
     <l n="13">She loves to walk in the still moonshine night ,</l>
     <l n="14">And in a thick dark grove she takes delight ;</l>
     <l n="15">In hollow caves , thatched houses , and low cells ,</l>
     <l n="16">She loves to live , and there alone she dwells .</l>

     <l n="3">In summers hot , down in a shade I lie ;</l>
     <l n="4">My music is the buzzing of a fly ;</l>
     <l n="5">I walk in meadows , where grows fresh green grass ;</l>
     <l n="6">In fields , where corn is high , I often pass ;</l>
     <l n="7">Walk up the hills , where round I prospects see ,</l>
     <l n="8">Some brushy woods , and some all champaigns be ;</l>
     <l n="9">Returning back , I in fresh pastures go ,</l>
     <l n="10">To hear how sheep do bleat , and cows do low ;</l>
     <l n="11">In winter cold , when nipping frosts come on ,</l>
     <l n="12">Then I do live in a small house alone ;</l>
     <l n="13">Although ‘ tis plain , yet cleanly ‘ tis within ,</l>
     <l n="14">Like to a soul that 's pure , and clear from sin ;</l>
     <l n="15">And there I dwell in quiet and still peace ,</l>
     <l n="16">Not filled with cares how riches to increase ;</l>
     <l n="17">I wish nor seek for vain and fruitless pleasures ;</l>
     <l n="18">No riches are , but what the mind intreasures .</l>
     <l n="19">Thus am I solitary , live alone ,</l>
     <l n="20">Yet better loved , the more that I am known ;</l>
     <l n="21">And though my face ill-favoured at first sight ,</l>
     <l n="22">After acquaintance , it will give delight .</l>
     <l n="23">Refuse me not , for I shall constant be ;</l>
     <l n="24">Maintain your credit and your dignity .</l>

   <p>THOMAS STANLEY .</p>
   <p>Thomas Stanley , like Thomas Brown in later days , was both a philosopher and a poet ; but his philosophical reputation at the time eclipsed his poetical . He was the only son of Sir Thomas Stanley of Camberlow Green , in Hertfordshire , and was born in 1620 . He received his education at Pembroke College , Oxford ; and after travelling for some years abroad , he took up his abode in the Middle Temple . Here he seems to have spent the rest of his life in patient and multifarious studies . He made translations of some merit from Anacreon , Bion , Moschus , and the ‘ Kisses ’ of Secundus , as well as from Marino , Boscan , Tristan , and Gongora . He wrote a work of great pretensions as a compilation , entitled ‘ The History of Philosophy , ’ containing the lives , opinions , actions , and discourses of philosophers of every sect , of which he published the first volume in 1655 , and completed it in a fourth in 1662 . It is rather a vast collection of the materials for a history , than a history itself . He is a Cudworth in magnitude and learning , but not in strength and comprehension , and is destitute of precision and clearness of style . Stanley also wrote some poems , which discover powers that might have been better employed in original composition than in translation . His style , rich of itself , is enriched to repletion by conceits , and sometimes by voluptuous sentiments and language . He adds a new flush to the cheek of Anacreon himself ; and his grapes are so heavy , that not a staff , but a wain were required to bear them . Stanley died in 1678 .</p>

   <p>ANDREW MARVELL .</p>
   <p>This noble-minded patriot and poet , the friend of Milton , the Abdiel of a dark and corrupt age ,— ‘ faithful found among the faithless , faithful only he , ’ — was born in Hull in 1620 . He was sent to Cambridge , and is said there to have nearly fallen a victim to the proselytising Jesuits , who enticed him to London . His father , however , a clergyman in Hull , went in search of and brought him back to his university , where speedily , by extensive culture and the vigorous exercise of his powerful faculties , he emancipated himself for ever from the dominion , and the danger of the dominion , of superstition and bigotry . We know little more about the early days of our poet . When only twenty , he lost his father in remarkable circumstances . In 1640 , he had embarked on the Humber in company with a youthful pair whom he was to marry at Barrow , in Lincolnshire . The weather was calm ; but Marvell , seized with a sudden presentiment of danger , threw his staff ashore , and cried out , ‘ Ho for heaven ! ’ A storm came on , and the whole company perished . In consequence of this sad event , the gentleman , whose daughter was to have been married , conceiving that the father had sacrificed his life while performing an act of friendship , adopted young Marvell as his son . Owing to this , he received a better education , and was sent abroad to travel . It is said that at Rome he met and formed a friendship with Milton , then engaged on his immortal continental tour . We find Marvell next at Constantinople , as Secretary to the English Embassy at that Court . We then lose sight of him till 1653 , when he was engaged by the Protector to superintend the education of a Mr Dutton at Eton . For a year and a half after Cromwell 's death , Marvell assisted Milton as Latin Secretary to the Protector . Our readers are all familiar with the print of Cromwell and Milton seated together at the council-table , — the one the express image of active power and rugged grandeur , the other of thoughtful majesty and ethereal grace . Marvell might have been added as a third , and become the emblem of strong English sense and incorruptible integrity . A letter of Milton 's was , not long since , discovered , dated February 1652 , in which he speaks of Marvell as fitted , by his knowledge of Latin and his experience of teaching , to be his assistant . He was not appointed , however , till 1657 . In 1660 , he became member for Hull , and was re-elected as long as he lived . He was absent , however , from England for two years , in the beginning of the reign , in Germany and Holland . After- wards he sought leave from his constituents to act as Ambassador 's Secretary to Lord Carlisle at the Northern Courts ; but from the year 1665 to his death , his attention to his parliamentary duties was unremitting . He constantly corresponded with his constituents ; and after the longest sittings , he used to write out for their use a minute account of public proceedings ere he went to bed , or took any refreshment . He was one of the last members who received pay from the town he represented ; ( 2s . a-day was probably the sum ;) and his constituents were wont , besides , to send him barrels of ale as tokens of their regard . Marvell spoke little in the House ; but his heart and vote were always in the right place . Even Prince Eupert continually consulted him , and was sometimes persuaded by him to support the popular side ; and King Charles having met him once in private , was so delighted with his wit and agreeable manners , that he thought him worth trying to bribe . He sent Lord Danby to offer him a mark of his Majesty 's consideration . Marvell , who was seated in a dingy room up several flights of stairs , declined the proffer , and , it is said , called his servant to witness that he had dined for three successive days on the same shoulder of mutton , and was not likely , therefore , to care for or need a bribe . When the Treasurer was gone , he had to send to a friend to borrow a guinea . Although , a silent senator , Marvell was a copious and popular writer . He attacked Bishop Parker for his slavish principles , in a piece entitled ‘ The Rehearsal Transposed , ’ in which he takes occasion to vindicate and panegyrise his old colleague Milton . His anonymous ‘ Account of the Growth of Arbitrary Power and Popery in England ’ excited a sensation , and a reward was offered for the apprehension of the author and printer . Marvell had many of the elements of a first-rate political pamphleteer . He had wit of a most pungent kind , great though coarse fertility of fancy , and a spirit of independence that nothing could subdue or damp . He was the undoubted ancestor of the Defoes , Swifts , Steeles , Juniuses , and Burkes , in whom this kind of authorship reached its perfection , ceased to be fugitive , and assumed classical rank .</p>
   <p>Marvell had been repeatedly threatened with assassination , and hence , when he died suddenly on the 16th of August 1678 , it was surmised that he had been removed by poison . The Corporation of Hull voted a sum to defray his funeral expenses , and for raising a monument to his memory ; but owing to the interference of the Court , through the rector of the parish , this votive tablet was not at the time erected . He was buried in St Giles-in-the-Fields .</p>
   <p>‘ Out of the strong came forth sweetness , ’ saith the Hebrew record . And so from the sturdy Andrew Marvell have proceeded such soft and lovely strains as ‘ The Emigrants , ’ ‘ The Nymph complaining for the Death of her Fawn , ’ ‘ Young Love , ’ &amp; c. The statue of Memnon became musical at the dawn ; and the stern patriot , whom no bribe could buy and no flattery melt , is found sympathising in song with a boatful of banished Englishmen in the remote Bermudas , and inditing ‘ Thoughts in a Garden , ’ from which you might suppose that he had spent his life more with melons than with men , and was better acquainted with the motions of a bee-hive than with the contests of Parliament , and the distractions of a most distracted age . It was said ( not with thorough truth ) of Milton , that he could cut out a Colossus from a rock , but could not carve heads upon cherry-stones — a task which his assistant may be said to have performed in his stead , in his small but delectable copies of verse .</p>

     <l n="77">And then to me ‘ twould boldly trip ,</l>
     <l n="78">And print those roses on my lip .</l>
     <l n="79">But all its chief delight was still</l>
     <l n="80">On roses thus itself to fill ,</l>

   <p>IZAAK WALTON .</p>
   <p>This amiable enemy of the finny tribe was born in Stafford , in August 1593 . We hear of him first as settled in London , following the trade of a sempster , or linen-draper , having a shop in the Royal Burse , in Cornhill , which was ‘ seven feet and a half long , and five wide , ’ and where he became possessed of a moderate fortune . He spent his leisure time in fishing ‘ with honest Nat and R. Roe . ’ From the Royal Burse , he removed to Fleet Street , where he had ‘ one half of a shop , ’ a hosier occupying the other half . In 1632 , he married Anne , the daughter of Thomas Ken of Furnival 's Inn , and sister of Dr Ken , the celebrated Bishop of Bath and Wells . Through her and her kindred , he became acquainted with many eminent men of the day . His wife , ‘ a woman of remarkable prudence and primitive piety , ’ died long before him . He retired from business in 1643 , and lived , for forty years after , a life of leisure and quiet enjoyment , spending much of his time in the houses of his friends , and much of it by the still waters , which he so dearly loved . Walton commenced his literary career by writing a Life of Dr Donne , and followed with another of Sir Henry Wotton , prefixed to his literary remains . In 1653 appeared his ‘ Complete Angler , ’ four editions of which were called for before his decease . He wrote , in 1662 , a Life of Richard Hooker ; in 1670 , a Life of George Herbert ; and , in 1678 , a Life of Bishop Sanderson — all distinguished by naïveté and heart . In 1680 , he published an anonymous discourse on the ‘ Distempers of the Times . ’ In 1683 , he printed , as we have seen , Chalkhill 's ‘ Thealma and Clearchus ; ’ and on the 15th of December in the same year , he died at Winchester , while residing with his son-in-law , Dr Hawkins , Prebendary of Winchester Cathedral .</p>
   <p>Walton is one of the most loveable of all authors . Your admiration of him is always melting into affection . Red as his and is with the blood of fish , you pant to grasp it and press it to yours . You go with him to the fishing as you would with a bright-eyed boy , relishing his simple-hearted enthusiasm , and leaning down to listen to his precocious remarks , and to pat his curly head . It is the prevalence of the childlike element which makes Walton 's ‘ Angler ’ rank with Bunyan 's ‘ Pilgrim , ’ ‘ Robinson Crusoe , ’ and White 's ‘ Natural History of Selborne , ’ as among the most delightful books in the language . Its descriptions of nature , too , are so fresh , that you smell to them as to a green leaf . Walton would not have been at home fishing in the Forth or Clyde , or in such rivers as are found in Norway , the milk-blue Logen , or the grass - green Rauma , uniting , with its rich mediation , Romsdale Horn to the tremendous Witch-Peaks which lower on the opposite side of the valley ; — the waters of his own dear England , going softly and somewhat drowsily on their path , are the sources of his inspiration , and seem to sound like the echoes of his own subdued but gladsome spirit . Johnson defined angling as a rod with a fish at one end , and a fool at the other ; in Walton 's case , we may correct the expression to ‘ a rod with a fish at one end , and a fine old fellow — the “ ae best fellow in the world ” — at the other ’ —</p>
   <p>‘ In wit a man , simplicity a child . ’</p>
   <p>We have given a specimen of the verse he intersperses sparingly in a book which is itself a complete poem .</p>

   <p>JOHN WILMOT , EARL OF ROCHESTER</p>
   <p>We hear of the Spirit of Evil on one occasion entering into swine , but , if possible , a stranger sight is that of the Spirit of Poesy finding a similar incarnation . Certainly the connexion of genius in the Earl of Rochester with a life of the most degrading and desperate debauchery is one of the chief marvels of this marvellous world .</p>
   <p>John Wilmot was the son of Henry , Lord Rochester , and was born April 10 , 1647 , at Ditchley in Oxfordshire . He was taught grammar at the school of Burford . He then ‘ entered a nobleman ’ into Wadham College , when twelve years old , and at 1661 , when only fourteen , he was , in conjunction with some others of rank , made M. A . by Lord Clarendon in person . Pursuing his travels in France and Italy , he went in 1665 to sea with the Earl of Sandwich , and distinguished himself at Bergen in an attack on the Dutch fleet . Next year , while serving under Sir Edward Spragge , his commander sent him in the heat of an engagement with a reproof to one of his captains — a duty which Wilmot gallantly accomplished amidst a storm of shot . With this early courage some of his biographers have contrasted his subsequent reputation for cowardice , his slinking away out of street-quarrels , his refusing to fight the Duke of Buckingham , &amp; c. This diversity at different periods may perhaps be accounted for on the ground of the nervousness which continued dissipation produces , and perhaps from his poetical temperament . A poet , we are persuaded , is often the bravest , and often the most pusillanimous of men . Byron was unquestionably in general a brave , almost a pugnacious man ; and yet he confesses that at certain times , had one proceeded to horsewhip him , he would not have had the hardihood to resist . Shelley , who , in a tremendous storm , behaved with dauntless heroism , and who would at any time have acted on the example of his own character in ‘ Prometheus , ’ who , in a shipwreck ,</p>
   <p>‘ gave an enemy His plank , then plunged aside to die , ’</p>
   <p>was yet subject to paroxysms of nervous horror , which made him perspire and tremble like a spirit-seeing steed . Rochester had the same temperament , and a similar creed , with these men , although inferior to them both in morale and in genius .</p>
   <p>His character was certainly very depraved . He told Burnet on his deathbed that for five years he had not known the sensation of sobriety , having been all that time either totally drunk , or mad through the dregs of drunkenness . He on one occasion , while in this state , erected a stage on Tower Hill , and addressed the mob as a naked mountebank . Even after he became more temperate , he continued and even increased his licentiousness — one devil went out , and seven entered in . He pursued low amours in disguise ; he practised occasionally as a quack doctor ; and at other times he retired to the country , and , like Byron , amused himself by libelling all his acquaintances — every line in each libel being a lie . Notwithstanding all this , he was a favourite with Charles II ., who made him one of the gentlemen of the bedchamber , and comptroller of Woodstock Park . In his lucid intervals he recurred to his studies , wrote occasional verses , read in French Boileau and in English Cowley , and is called by Wood the best scholar among all the nobility .</p>
   <p>At last , ere he was thirty-one , the ‘ dreary old sort of feel , ’ and the ‘ rigid fibre and stiffening limbs , ’ of which Byron and Burns , when scarcely older , complained , began to assail Rochester . He had exhausted his capacity of enjoyment by excess , and had deprived himself of the consolations of religion by infidelity . His unbelief was not like Shelley 's — the growth of his own mind , and the fruit of unbridled , though earnest , speculation ;— it was merely a drug which he snatched from the laboratories of others to deaden his remorse , and enable him to look with desperate calmness to the blotted Past and the lowering Future . At this stage of his career , he became acquainted with Bishop Burnet , who has recorded his conversion and edifying end in a book which , says Johnson , ‘ the critic ought to read for its elegance , the philosopher for its arguments , and the saint for its piety . ’ To this , after Johnson 's example , we refer our readers . Eochester died July 26 , 1680 , before he had completed his thirty-fourth year . He was married , and left three daughters and a son named Charles , who did not long survive his father . With him the male line ceased , and the title was conferred on a younger son of Lord Clarendon . His poems appeared in the year of his death , professing on the title-page to be printed at Antwerp . They contain much that is spurious , but some productions that are undoubtedly Rochester 's . They are at the best , poor fragmentary exhibitions of a vigorous , but undisciplined mind . His songs are rather easy than lively . His imitations are distinguished by grace and spirit . His ‘ Nothing ’ is a tissue of clever conceits , like gaudy weeds growing on a sterile soil , but here and there contains a grand and gloomy image , such as —</p>
   <p>‘ And rebel Light obscured thy reverend dusky face . ’</p>
   <p>His ‘ Satire against Man ’ might be praised for its vigorous misanthropy , but is chiefly copied from Boileau .</p>
   <p>Rochester may be signalised as the first thoroughly depraved and vicious person , so far as we remember , who assumed the office of the satirist , — the first , although not , alas ! the last human imitator of ‘ Satan accusing Sin . ’ Some satirists before him had been faulty characters , while rather inconsistently assailing the faults of others ; but here , for the first time , was a man of no virtue , or belief in virtue whatever , ( his tenderness to his family , revealed in his letters , is just that of the tiger fondling his cubs , and seeming , perhaps , to them a ‘ much - misrepresented character , ’ ) and whose life was one mass of wounds , bruises , and putrefying sores ,— a naked satyr who gloried in his shame , — becoming a severe castigator of public morals and of private character . Surely there was a gross anomaly implied in this , which far greater genius than Rochester 's could never have redeemed .</p>

   <p>THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON .</p>
   <p>Wentworth Dillon , Earl of Roscommon , was the son of James Dillon and Elizabeth Wentworth . She was the sister of the infamous Strafford , who was at once uncle and godfather to our poet . In what exact year Dillon was born is uncertain , but it was some time about 1633 . His father had been converted from Popery by Usher ; and when the Irish Rebellion broke out , Strafford , afraid of the fury of the Irish , sent for his godson , and took him to his own seat in Yorkshire , where he was taught Latin with great care . He was sent afterwards to Caen , where he studied under Bochart . It is said that while playing extravagantly there at the customary games of boys , he suddenly paused , became grave , and cried out , ‘ My father is dead , ’ and that a fortnight after arrived tidings from Ireland confirming his impression . Johnson is inclined to believe this story , and we are more than inclined . Since the lexicographer 's day , many of what used to be called his ‘ superstitions ’ have been established as certain facts , although their explanation is still shrouded in darkness . Roscommon was then only ten years of age .</p>
   <p>From Caen he travelled to Italy , where he obtained a profound knowledge of medals . At the Restoration he returned to England , where he was made Captain of the Band of Pensioners , and subsequently Master of the Horse to the Duchess of York . He became unfortunately addicted to gambling , and , through this miserable habit , he got embroiled in endless quarrels , as well as in pecuniary embarassments .</p>
   <p>Business compelled him to visit Ireland , where the Duke of Orrnond made him Captain of the Guards . On his return to England in 1662 , he married the Lady Frances , daughter of the Earl of Burlington . By her he had no issue . His second wife , whom he married in 1674 , was Isabella , daughter of Matthew Beynton of Barmister , in Yorkshire .</p>
   <p>Roscommon now began to meditate and execute literary projects . He produced an ‘ Essay on Translated Verse , ’ ( in 1681 ,) a translation of Horace 's ‘ Art of Poetry , ’ and other pieces . He projected , in conjunction with his friend Dryden , a plan for refining our language and fixing its standard , as if Time were not the great refiner , fixer , and enricher of a tongue . While busy with these schemes and occupations , the troubles of James II . ' s reign commenced . Roscommon determined to retire to Rome , saying , ‘ It is best to sit near the chimney when the chamber smokes . ’ Death , however , prevented him from reaching the beloved and desired focus of Roman Catholic darkness . He was assailed by gout , and an ignorant French empiric , whom he consulted , contrived to drive the disease into the bowels . Roscommon expired , uttering with great fervour two lines from his own translation of the ‘ Dies Irae , ’ —</p>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">‘ My God , my Father , and my Friend ,</l>
     <l n="2">Do not forsake me in my end . ’</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">This was in 1684 . He received a pompous interment in Westminster Abbey .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Roscommon does not deserve the name of a great poet . He was a man of varied accomplishments and exquisite taste rather than of genius . His ‘ Essay on Translated Verse ’ is a sound and sensible , not a profound and brilliant production . In one point he went before his age . He praises Milton 's ‘ Paradise Lost , ’ although unfortunately he selects for encomium the passage in the sixth book describing the angels fighting against each other with fire-arms — a passage which most critics have considered a blot upon the poem .</p>

    <head>CHARLES COTTON .</head>
    <head>Hearty , careless ‘ Charley Cotton ’ was born in 1630 . His father , Sir George Cotton , was improvident and intemperate in his latter days , and left the poet an encumbered estate situated at Ashbourne , in Derbyshire , near the river Dove . This place will recall the words quoted by O'Connell in Parliament in reference to the present Lord Derby :—</head>
     <l n="1">‘ Down thy fair banks , romantic Ashbourne , glides</l>
     <l n="2">The Derby dilly , with its six insides . ’</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Charles studied at Cambridge ; and after travelling abroad , married the daughter of Sir Thomas Owthorp in Nottinghamshire , who does not appear to have lived long . His extravagance keeping him poor , he was compelled to eke out his means by translating works from the French and Italian , including those of a spirit somewhat kindred to his own — Montaigne . At the age of forty , he obtained a captain 's commission in the army , and went to Ireland . There he met with his second wife , Mary , Countess Dowager of Ardglass , the widow of Lord Cornwall . She possessed a jointure of £ 1500 a-year , secured , however , after marriage , from her husband 's imprudent and reckless management . He returned to his English estate , where he became passionately fond of fishing ,— intimate with Izaak Walton , whom he invited in a poem , although now eighty-three years old , to visit him in the country — and where he built a fishing-house , with the initials of Izaak 's name and his own united in ciphers over the door ; the walls , too , being painted with fishing scenes , and the portraits of Cotton and Walton appearing upon the beaufet . Poor Charles had a less fortunate career than his friend , dying insolvent at Westminster in 1687 .</p>
   <p>Careless gaiety and reckless extravagance , blended with heart , sense , and sincerity , were the characteristics of Cotton as a man , and were , as is usually the case , transferred to his poetry . He squandered his pence and his powers with equal profusion . His travestie of the ‘ Aeneid ’ is pronounced by Christopher North ( who must have read it , however ,) a beastly book . Campbell says , with striking justice , of another of Cotton 's productions , ‘ His imitations of Lucian betray the grossest misconception of humorous effect , when he attempts to burlesque that which is ludicrous already . ’ It is like trying to turn the ‘ Tale of a Tub ’ into ridicule . But Cotton 's own vein , as exhibited in his ‘ Invitation to Walton , ’ his ‘ New Year , ’ and his ‘ Voyage to Ireland , ’ ( which anticipates in some measure the style of Anstey in the ‘ New Bath Guide , ’ ) is very rich and varied , full of ease , picturesque spirit , and humour , and stamps him a genuine , if not a great poet .</p>

      <l n="74">That knot would be one day slipped under his ear .</l>

      <l n="76">‘ The best liquor , ’ quoth I , ‘ that the house will afford . ’</l>
      <l n="77">‘ You shall straight , ’ quoth he ; and then calls out , ‘ Mary ?</l>

      <l n="79">‘ Hold , hold , my spruce host ! for i ’ th ’ morning so early ,</l>
      <l n="80">I never drink liquor but what 's made of barley . ’</l>
      <l n="81">Which words were scarce out , but , which made me admire ,</l>

      <l n="97">With visage as oval and sleek as an egg ,</l>
      <l n="98">As straight as an arrow , as right as my leg :</l>
      <l n="99">A curtsey she made , as demure as a sister ,</l>
      <l n="100">I could not forbear , but alighted and kissed her :</l>
      <l n="101">Then ducking another , with most modest mien ,</l>
      <l n="102">The first word she said was , ‘ Will ‘ t please you walk in ?</l>
      <l n="103">I thanked her ; but told her , I then could not stay ,</l>

      <l n="109">Meanwhile my spruce landlord has broken the cork ,</l>

      <l n="121">Sans bragging , I hate it , nor will I e'er do ‘ t ;</l>
      <l n="122">I defy Leek , and Lambhith , and Sandwich , to boot . ’</l>
      <l n="123">By my troth , he said true , for I speak it with tears ,</l>

      <l n="159">After seven hours ’ sleep , to commute for pains taken ,</l>
      <l n="160">A man of himself , one would think , might awaken ;</l>
      <l n="161">But riding , and drinking hard , were two such spells ,</l>
      <l n="162">I doubt I 'd slept on , but for jangling of bells ,</l>
      <l n="163">Which , ringing to matins all over the town ,</l>

      <l n="165">With intent ( so God mend me ) t ’ have gone to the choir ,</l>
      <l n="166">When straight I perceived myself all on a fire ;</l>
      <l n="167">For the two forenamed things had so heated my blood ,</l>
      <l n="168">That a little phlebotomy would do me good :</l>
      <l n="169">I sent for chirurgeon , who came in a trice ,</l>
      <l n="170">And swift to shed blood , needed not be called twice ,</l>
      <l n="171">But tilted stiletto quite thorough the vein ,</l>

      <l n="176">It had cooled my devotion as well as my blood ;</l>
      <l n="177">For I had no more mind to look on my psalter ,</l>

      <l n="199">And now in devotion was even so proud ,</l>
      <l n="200">I scorned forsooth to join prayer with the crowd ;</l>

      <l n="220">A glorious gold belt in the rear of his train ,</l>
      <l n="221">Made such a low congé , forgetting his place ,</l>
      <l n="222">I was never so honoured before in my days :</l>
      <l n="223">But then off went my scalp-case , and down went my fist ,</l>
      <l n="224">Till the pavement , too hard , by my knuckles was kissed ;</l>
      <l n="225">By which , though thick-skulled , he must understand this ,</l>
      <l n="226">That I was a most humble servant of his ;</l>
      <l n="227">Which also so wonderful kindly he took ,</l>
      <l n="228">( As I well perceived both b ’ his gesture and look ,)</l>
      <l n="229">That to have me dogg 'd home he straightway appointed ,</l>
      <l n="230">Resolving , it seems , to be better acquainted .</l>
      <l n="231">I was scarce in my quarters , and set down on crupper ,</l>
      <l n="232">But his man was there too , to invite me to supper :</l>
      <l n="233">I start up , and after most respective fashion</l>
      <l n="234">Gave his worship much thanks for his kind invitation ;</l>
      <l n="235">But begged his excuse , for my stomach was small ,</l>
      <l n="236">And I never did eat any supper at all ;</l>
      <l n="237">But that after supper I would kiss his hands ,</l>
      <l n="238">And would come to receive his worship 's commands .</l>
      <l n="239">Sure no one will say , but a patron of slander ,</l>
      <l n="240">That this was not pretty well for a Moorlander :</l>
      <l n="241">And since on such reasons to sup I refused ,</l>
      <l n="242">I nothing did doubt to be holden excused ;</l>

      <l n="244">With so wonderful good a conceit of the rest ,</l>
      <l n="245">That with mere impatience he hoped in his breeches</l>
      <l n="246">To see the fine fellow that made such fine speeches :</l>
      <l n="247">‘ Go , sirrah ! ’ quoth he , ‘ get you to him again ,</l>
      <l n="248">And will and require , in his Majesty 's name ,</l>

      <l n="250">I 'll teach him to know that he 's now in West-Chester . ’</l>
      <l n="251">The man , upon this , comes me running again ,</l>
      <l n="252">But yet minced his message , and was not so plain ;</l>
      <l n="253">Saying to me only , ‘ Good sir , I am sorry</l>

      <l n="256">That I , with these ears , heard him swear and protest ,</l>

      <l n="258">Nor open his napkin , until you do come . ’</l>
      <l n="259">With that I perceived no excuse would avail ,</l>

      <l n="261">I said I was ready master may'r to obey ,</l>
      <l n="262">And therefore desired him to lead me the way .</l>
      <l n="263">We went , and ere Malkin could well lick her ear ,</l>
      <l n="264">( For it but the next door was , forsooth ) we were there ;</l>
      <l n="265">Where lights being brought me , I mounted the stairs ,</l>
      <l n="266">The worst I e'er saw in my life at a mayor 's :</l>
      <l n="267">But everything else must be highly commended .</l>
      <l n="268">I there found his worship most nobly attended ,</l>
      <l n="269">Besides such a supper as well did convince ,</l>
      <l n="270">A may'r in his province to be a great prince ;</l>
      <l n="271">As he sat in his chair , he did not much vary ,</l>
      <l n="272">In state nor in face , from our eighth English Harry ;</l>
      <l n="273">But whether his face was swelled up with fat ,</l>
      <l n="274">Or puffed up with glory , I cannot tell that .</l>
      <l n="275">Being entered the chamber half length of a pike ,</l>
      <l n="276">And cutting of faces exceedingly like</l>
      <l n="277">One of those little gentlemen brought from the Indies ,</l>
      <l n="278">And screwing myself into congés and cringes ,</l>
      <l n="279">By then I was half-way advanced in the room ,</l>
      <l n="280">His worship most rev'rendly rose from his bum ,</l>

      <l n="282">Advanced a whole step and a half for to meet me ;</l>
      <l n="283">Where leisurely doffing a hat worth a tester ,</l>
      <l n="284">He bade me most heartily welcome to Chester .</l>
      <l n="285">I thanked him in language the best I was able ,</l>

      <l n="287">Now here you must note , and ‘ tis worth observation ,</l>

      <l n="289">So sweet mistress may'ress , in just such another ,</l>
      <l n="290">Like the fair queen of hearts , sat in state at the other ;</l>
      <l n="291">By which I perceived , though it seemed a riddle ,</l>
      <l n="292">The lower end of this must be just in the middle :</l>
      <l n="293">But perhaps ‘ tis a rule there , and one that would mind it</l>
      <l n="294">Amongst the town-statutes ‘ tis likely might find it .</l>
      <l n="295">But now into the pottage each deep his spoon claps ,</l>
      <l n="296">As in truth one might safely for burning one 's chaps ,</l>
      <l n="297">When straight , with the look and the tone of a scold ,</l>
      <l n="298">Mistress may'ress complained that the pottage was cold ;</l>
      <l n="299">‘ And all ‘ long of your fiddle-faddle , ’ quoth she .</l>
      <l n="300">‘ Why , what then , Goody Two-Shoes , what if it be ?</l>
      <l n="301">Hold you , if you can , your tittle-tattle , ’ quoth he .</l>
      <l n="302">I was glad she was snapped thus , and guessed by th ’ discourse ,</l>
      <l n="303">The may'r , not the gray mare , was the better horse ,</l>
      <l n="304">And yet for all that , there is reason to fear ,</l>
      <l n="305">She submitted but out of respect to his year :</l>
      <l n="306">However ‘ twas well she had now so much grace ,</l>
      <l n="307">Though not to the man , to submit to his place ;</l>
      <l n="308">For had she proceeded , I verily thought</l>
      <l n="309">My turn would the next be , for I was in fault :</l>
      <l n="310">But this brush being past , we fell to our diet ,</l>
      <l n="311">And every one there filled his belly in quiet .</l>
      <l n="312">Supper being ended , and things away taken ,</l>
      <l n="313">Master mayor 's curiosity ‘ gan to awaken ;</l>
      <l n="314">Wherefore making me draw something nearer his chair ,</l>
      <l n="315">He willed and required me there to declare</l>
      <l n="316">My country , my birth , my estate , and my parts ,</l>
      <l n="317">And whether I was not a master of arts ;</l>
      <l n="318">And eke what the business was had brought me thither ,</l>
      <l n="319">With what I was going about now , and whither :</l>
      <l n="320">Giving me caution , no lie should escape me ,</l>
      <l n="321">For if I should trip , he should certainly trap me .</l>
      <l n="322">I answered , my country was famed Staffordshire ;</l>
      <l n="323">That in deeds , bills , and bonds , I was ever writ squire ;</l>
      <l n="324">That of land I had both sorts , some good , and some evil ,</l>
      <l n="325">But that a great part o n't was pawned to the devil ;</l>
      <l n="326">That as for my parts , they were such as he saw ;</l>
      <l n="327">That , indeed , I had a small smatt'ring of law ,</l>

      <l n="356">The sun in the morning disclosed his light ,</l>
      <l n="357">With complexion as ruddy as mine over night ;</l>
      <l n="358">And o'er th ’ eastern mountains peeping up 's head ,</l>
      <l n="359">The casement being open , espied me in bed ;</l>
      <l n="360">With his rays he so tickled my lids that I waked ,</l>
      <l n="361">And was half ashamed , for I found myself naked ;</l>
      <l n="362">But up I soon start , and was dressed in a trice ,</l>
      <l n="363">And called for a draught of ale , sugar , and spice ;</l>
      <l n="364">Which having turned off , I then call to pay ,</l>
      <l n="365">And packing my nawls , whipt to horse , and away .</l>
      <l n="366">A guide I had got , who demanded great vails ,</l>
      <l n="367">For conducting me over the mountains of Wales :</l>
      <l n="368">Twenty good shillings , which sure very large is ;</l>
      <l n="369">Yet that would not serve , but I must bear his charges ;</l>
      <l n="370">And yet for all that , rode astride on a beast ,</l>
      <l n="371">The worst that e'er went on three legs , I protest :</l>
      <l n="372">It certainly was the most ugly of jades ,</l>
      <l n="373">His hips and his rump made a right ace of spades ;</l>
      <l n="374">His sides were two ladders , well spur-galled withal ;</l>
      <l n="375">His neck was a helve , and his head was a mall ;</l>
      <l n="376">For his colour , my pains and your trouble I 'll spare ,</l>
      <l n="377">For the creature was wholly denuded of hair ;</l>
      <l n="378">And , except for two things , as bare as my nail ,</l>
      <l n="379">A tuft of a mane , and a sprig of a tail ;</l>
      <l n="380">And by these the true colour one can no more know ,</l>
      <l n="381">Than by mouse-skins above stairs , the merkin below .</l>
      <l n="382">Now such as the beast was , even such was the rider ,</l>
      <l n="383">With a head like a nutmeg , and legs like a spider ;</l>
      <l n="384">A voice like a cricket , a look like a rat ,</l>
      <l n="385">The brains of a goose , and the heart of a cat :</l>
      <l n="386">Even such was my guide and his beast ; let them pass ,</l>
      <l n="387">The one for a horse , and the other an ass .</l>
      <l n="388">But now with our horses , what sound and what rotten ,</l>
      <l n="389">Down to the shore , you must know , we were gotten ;</l>
      <l n="390">And there we were told , it concerned us to ride ,</l>
      <l n="391">Unless we did mean to encounter the tide ;</l>
      <l n="392">And then my guide lab'ring with heels and with hands ,</l>
      <l n="393">With two up and one down , hopped over the sands ,</l>
      <l n="394">Till his horse , finding the labour for three legs too sore ,</l>
      <l n="395">Foaled out a new leg , and then he had four :</l>
      <l n="396">And now by plain dint of hard spurring and whipping ,</l>
      <l n="397">Dry-shod we came where folks sometimes take shipping ;</l>
      <l n="398">And where the salt sea , as the devil were in ‘ t ,</l>
      <l n="399">Came roaring t ’ have hindered our journey to Flint ;</l>
      <l n="400">But we , by good luck , before him got thither ,</l>

      <l n="404">For her ride in great haste , and * *</l>
      <l n="405">For fear of her being catched up by the fishes :</l>
      <l n="406">But the lord of Flint castle 's no lord worth a louse ,</l>
      <l n="407">For he keeps ne'er a drop of good drink in his house ;</l>

      <l n="411">For this had the taste and complexion of puddle .</l>

      <l n="413">My guide before prancing , his steed no more lame ,</l>

      <l n="416">More hungry and thirsty than tongue can well tell ,</l>
      <l n="417">We happily came to Saint Winifred 's well :</l>
      <l n="418">I thought it the pool of Bethesda had been ,</l>
      <l n="419">By the cripples lay there ; but I went to my inn</l>
      <l n="420">To speak for some meat , for so stomach did motion ,</l>
      <l n="421">Before I did further proceed in devotion :</l>
      <l n="422">I went into th ’ kitchen , where victuals I saw ,</l>
      <l n="423">Both beef , veal , and mutton , but all on ‘ t was raw ;</l>
      <l n="424">And some o n't alive , but soon went to slaughter ,</l>
      <l n="425">For four chickens were slain by my dame and her daughter ;</l>
      <l n="426">Of which to Saint Win . ere my vows I had paid ,</l>
      <l n="427">They said I should find a rare fricasée made :</l>
      <l n="428">I thanked them , and straight to the well did repair ,</l>
      <l n="429">Where some I found cursing , and others at prayer ;</l>
      <l n="430">Some dressing , some stripping , some out and some in ,</l>
      <l n="431">Some naked , where botches and boils might be seen ;</l>
      <l n="432">Of which some were fevers of Venus I 'm sure ,</l>
      <l n="433">And therefore unfit for the virgin to cure :</l>
      <l n="434">But the fountain , in truth , is well worth the sight ,</l>
      <l n="435">The beautiful virgin 's own tears not more bright ;</l>
      <l n="436">Nay , none but she ever shed such a tear ,</l>
      <l n="437">Her conscience , her name , nor herself , were more clear .</l>
      <l n="438">In the bottom there lie certain stones that look white ,</l>
      <l n="439">But streaked with pure red , as the morning with light ,</l>
      <l n="440">Which they say is her blood , and so it may be ,</l>
      <l n="441">But for that , let who shed it look to it for me .</l>
      <l n="442">Over the fountain a chapel there stands ,</l>
      <l n="443">Which I wonder has ‘ scaped master Oliver 's hands ;</l>
      <l n="444">The floor 's not ill paved , and the margin o ’ th ’ spring</l>
      <l n="445">Is inclosed with a certain octagonal ring ;</l>
      <l n="446">From each angle of which a pillar does rise ,</l>
      <l n="447">Of strength and of thickness enough to suffice</l>
      <l n="448">To support and uphold from falling to ground</l>
      <l n="449">A cupola wherewith the virgin is crowned .</l>
      <l n="450">Now ‘ twixt the two angles that fork to the north ,</l>
      <l n="451">And where the cold nymph does her basin pour forth ,</l>
      <l n="452">Under ground is a place where they bathe , as ‘ tis said ,</l>
      <l n="453">And ‘ tis true , for I heard folks ’ teeth hack in their head ;</l>
      <l n="454">For you are to know , that the rogues and the * *</l>
      <l n="455">Are not let to pollute the spring-head with their sores .</l>
      <l n="456">But one thing I chiefly admired in the place ,</l>
      <l n="457">That a saint and a virgin endued with such grace ,</l>
      <l n="458">Should yet be so wonderful kind a well-willer</l>
      <l n="459">To that whoring and filching trade of a miller ,</l>
      <l n="460">As within a few paces to furnish the wheels</l>
      <l n="461">Of I cannot tell how many water-mills :</l>
      <l n="462">I 've studied that point much , you cannot guess why ,</l>
      <l n="463">But the virgin was , doubtless , more righteous than I .</l>
      <l n="464">And now for my welcome , four , five , or six lasses ,</l>
      <l n="465">With as many crystalline liberal glasses ,</l>
      <l n="466">Did all importune me to drink of the water</l>
      <l n="467">Of Saint Winifreda , good Thewith 's fair daughter .</l>
      <l n="468">A while I was doubtful , and stood in a muse ,</l>
      <l n="469">Not knowing , amidst all that choice , where to choose .</l>
      <l n="470">Till a pair of black eyes , darting full in my sight ,</l>
      <l n="471">From the rest o ’ th ’ fair maidens did carry me quite ;</l>

   <p>DR HENRY MORE .</p>
   <p>This eminent man was the son of a gentleman of good family and estate in Grantham , Lincolnshire . He was born in 1614 . His father sent him to study at Eton , and thence , in 1631 , he repaired to Cambridge , where he was destined to spend the most of his life . Philosophy attracted him early , in preference to science or literature , and he became a follower of Plato , so decided and enthusiastic as to gain for himself the title of ‘ The Platonist ’ par excellence . In 1639 , he graduated M. A . ; and the next year , he published the first part of ‘ Psychozoia ; or , The Song of the Soul , ’ containing a Christiano-Platonical account of Man and Life . In preparing the materials of this poem , he had studied all the principal Platonists and mystical writers , and is said to have read himself almost to a shadow . And not only was his body emaciated , but his mind was so overstrung , that he imagined himself to see spiritual beings , to hear supernatural voices , and to converse , like Socrates , with a particular genius . He thought , too , that his body ‘ exhaled the perfume of violets ! ’ Notwithstanding these little peculiarities , his genius and his learning , the simplicity of his character , and the innocence of his life , rendered him a general favourite ; he was made a fellow of his college , and became a tutor to various persons of distinguished rank . One of these was Sir John Finch , whose sister , Lady Conway , an enthusiast herself , brought More acquainted with the famous John Baptist Van Helment , a man after whom , in the beginning of the seventeenth century , the whole of Europe wondered . He was a follower and imitator of Paracelsus , like him affected universal knowledge , aspired to revolutionise the science of medicine , and died with the reputation of one who , with great powers and acquirements , instead of becoming a great man , ended as a brilliant pretender , and was rather an ‘ architect of ruin ’ to the systems of others , than the founder of a solid fabric of his own . More admired , of course , not the quackery , but the adventurous boldness of Helment 's genius , and his devotion to chemistry ; which is certainly the most spiritual of all the sciences , and must , especially in its transcendental forms , have had a great charm for a Platonic thinker . Our author was entirely devoted to study , and resisted every inducement to leave what he called his ‘ Paradise ’ at Cambridge . His friends once tried to decoy him into a bishopric , and got him the length of Whitehall to kiss the king 's hand on the occasion ; but when he understood their purpose , he refused to go a single step further . His life was a long , learned , happy , and holy dream . He was of the most benevolent disposition ; and once observed to a friend , ‘ that he was thought by some to have a soft head , but he thanked God he had a soft heart . ’ In the heat of the Rebellion , the Republicans spared More , although he had refused to take the Covenant . Campbell says of him , ‘ He corresponded with Descartes , was the friend of Cudworth , and , as a divine and a moralist , was not only popular in his own time , but has been mentioned with admiration both by Addison and Blair . ’ One is rather amused at the latter clause . That a man of More 's massive learning , noble eloquence , and divine genius should need the testimony of a mere elegant wordmonger like Blair , seems ludicrous enough ; and Addison himself , except in wit and humour , was not worthy to have untied the shoelatchets of the old Platonist . We were first introduced to this writer by good Dr John Brown , late of Broughton Place , Edinburgh , and shall never forget hearing him , in his library , read some splendid passages from More 's work , in those deep , mellow , antique tones which flavoured whatever he read , like the crust on old wine . His chief works are , ‘ A Discourse on the Immortality of the Soul , ’ ‘ The Mystery of Godliness , ’ ‘ The Mystery of Iniquity , ’ ‘ Divine Dialogues , ’ ‘ An Antidote against Atheism , ’ ‘ Ethical and Metaphysical Manuals , ’ &amp; c. In writing such books , and pursuing the recondite studies of which they were the fruit , More spent his life happily . In 1661 , he became a Fellow of the Royal Society . For twenty years after the Restoration , his works are said to have sold better than any of their day — a curious and unaccountable fact , considering the levity and licentiousness of the period . In September 1687 , the fine old spiritualist , aged seventy - three , went away to that land of ‘ ideas ’ to which his heart had been translated long before .</p>
   <p>More 's prose writings give us , on the whole , a higher idea of his powers than his poem . This is not exactly , as a recent critic calls it , ‘ dull and tedious , ’ but it is in some parts prosaic , and in others obscure . The gleams of fancy in it are genuine , but few and far between . But his prose works constitute , like those of Cudworth , Charnock , Jeremy Taylor , and John Scott , a vast old quarry , abounding both in blocks and in gems — blocks of granite solidity , and gems of starry lustre . The peculiarity of More is in that poetico-philosophic mist which , like the autumnal gossamer , hangs in light and beautiful festoons over his thoughts , and which suggests pleasing memories of Plato and the Alexandrian school . Like all the followers of the Grecian sage , he dwells in a region of ‘ ideas , ’ which are to him the only realities , and are not cold , but warm ; he sees all things in Divine solution ; the visible is lost in the invisible , and nature retires before her God . Surely they are splendid reveries those of the Platonic school ; but it is sad to reflect that they have not cast the slightest gleam of light on the dark , frightful , faith-shattering mysteries which perplex all inquirers . The old shadows of sin , death , damnation , evil , and hell , are found to darken the ‘ ideas ’ of Plato 's world quite as deeply as they do the actualities of this weary , work-day earth , into which men have , for some inscrutable purpose , been sent to be , on the whole , miserable ,— so often to toil without compen - sation , to suffer without benefit , and to hope without fulfilment .</p>

    <head>WILLIAM CHAMBERLAYNE .</head>
    <head>Chamberlayne was , during life , a poor man , and , till long after his death , an unappreciated poet . He was a physician at Shaftesbury , Dorsetshire ; born in 1619 , and died in 1689 . He appears to have been present among the Royalists at the battle of Newbury . He complains bitterly of his narrow circumstances , and yet he lived to a long age . He published , in 1658 , a tragic comedy , entitled ‘ Love 's Victory , ’ and in 1659 , ‘ Pharonnida , ’ a heroic poem .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">

   <p>but the style is often elliptical and involved ; the story meanders too much , and is too long and intricate ; and , on the whole , a few mutilated fragments are all that are likely to remain of an original and highly elaborate poem .</p>

    <head>ARGALIA TAKEN PRISONER BY THE TURKS .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">* * The Turks had ought</l>
     <l n="2">Made desperate onslaughts on the isle , but brought</l>
     <l n="3">Nought back but wounds and infamy ; but now ,</l>
     <l n="4">Wearied with toil , they are resolved to bow</l>
     <l n="5">Their stubborn resolutions with the strength</l>
     <l n="6">Of not-to-be-resisted want : the length</l>
     <l n="7">Of the chronical disease extended had</l>
     <l n="8">To some few months , since to oppress the sad</l>
     <l n="9">But constant islanders , the army lay ,</l>
     <l n="10">Circling their confines . Whilst this tedious stay</l>
     <l n="11">From battle rusts the soldier 's valour in</l>
     <l n="12">His tainted cabin , there had often been ,</l>
     <l n="13">With all variety of fortune , fought</l>
     <l n="14">Brave single combats , whose success had brought</l>
     <l n="15">Honour 's unwithered laurels on the brow</l>
     <l n="16">Of either party ; but the balance , now</l>
     <l n="17">Forced by the hand of a brave Turk , inclined</l>
     <l n="18">Wholly to them . Thrice had his valour shined</l>
     <l n="19">In victory 's refulgent rays , thrice heard</l>
     <l n="20">The shouts of conquest ; thrice on his lance appeared</l>
     <l n="21">The heads of noble Rhodians , which had struck</l>
     <l n="22">A general sorrow ‘ mongst the knights . All look</l>
     <l n="23">Who next the lists should enter ; each desires</l>
     <l n="24">The task were his , but honour now requires</l>
     <l n="25">A spirit more than vulgar , or she dies</l>

     <l n="27">To prop whose ruins , chosen by the free</l>

     <l n="30">The combat ends , the expecting people fill</l>

     <l n="32">Their tents , of whom the city ladies take</l>
     <l n="33">A dreadful view , till a more noble sight</l>
     <l n="34">Diverts their looks ; each part behold their knight</l>
     <l n="35">With various wishes , whilst in blood and sweat</l>
     <l n="36">They toil for victory . The conflict 's heat</l>
     <l n="37">Raged in their veins , which honour more inflamed</l>
     <l n="38">Than burning calentures could do ; both blamed</l>
     <l n="39">The feeble influence of their stars , that gave</l>
     <l n="40">No speedier conquest ; each neglects to save</l>

     <l n="68">To quench with the brave Christian 's death , he sent</l>
     <l n="69">Him living to her , that her anger , spent</l>
     <l n="70">In flaming torments , might not settle in</l>
     <l n="71">The dregs of discontent . Staying to win</l>
     <l n="72">Some Rhodian castles , all the prisoners were</l>

     <l n="74">To meet their wretched thraldom . From the rest</l>

     <l n="76">With speedy death , though waited on by all</l>
     <l n="77">The hell-instructed torments that could fall</l>
     <l n="78">Within invention 's reach ; but he 's not yet</l>
     <l n="79">Arrived to his period , his unmoved stars sit</l>
     <l n="80">Thus in their orbs secured . It was the use</l>
     <l n="81">Of the Turkish pride , which triumphs in the abuse</l>
     <l n="82">Of suffering Christians , once , before they take</l>
     <l n="83">The ornaments of nature off , to make</l>
     <l n="84">Their prisoners public to the view , that all</l>
     <l n="85">Might mock their miseries : this sight did call</l>
     <l n="86">Janusa to her palace-window , where ,</l>
     <l n="87">Whilst she beholds them , love resolved to bear</l>
     <l n="88">Her ruin on her treacherous eye-beams , till</l>
     <l n="89">Her heart infected grew ; their orbs did fill ,</l>
     <l n="90">As the most pleasing object , with the sight</l>
     <l n="91">Of him whose sword opened a way for the flight</l>
     <l n="92">Of her loved brother 's soul .</l>

   <p>HENRY VAUGHAN .</p>
   <p>Vaughan was torn in Wales , on the banks of the Uske , in Brecknockshire , in 1614 . His father was a gentleman , but , we presume , poor , as his son was bred to a profession . Young Vaughan became first a lawyer , and then a physician ; and we suppose , had it not been for his advanced life , he would have become latterly a clergyman , since he grew , when old , exceedingly devout . In life , he was not fortunate , and we find him , like Chamberlayne , complaining bitterly of the poverty of the poetical tribe . In 1651 , he published a volume of verse , in which nascent excellence struggles with dim obscurities , like a young moon with heavy clouds . But his ‘ Silex Scintillans , ’ or ‘ Sacred Poems , ’ produced in later life , attests at once the depth of his devotion , and the truth and originality of his genius . He died in 1695 .</p>
   <p>Campbell , always prone to be rather severe on pious poets , and whose taste , too , was finical at times , says of Vaughan — ‘ He is one of the harshest even of the inferior order of the school of conceit ; but he has some few scattered thoughts that meet the eye amidst his harsh pages , like wild flowers on a barren heath . ’ Surely this is rather ‘ harsh ’ judgment . At the same time , it is not a little laughable to find that Campbell has himself appropriated one of these ‘ wild flowers . ’ In his beautiful ‘ Rainbow , ’ he cries —</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">‘ How came the world 's gray fathers forth</l>
     <l n="2">To mark thy sacred sign ! ’</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">Vaughan had said —</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="4">‘ How bright wert thou , when Shem 's admiring eye ,</l>
     <l n="5">Thy burnished , flaming arch did first descry ;</l>
     <l n="6">When Terah , Nahor , Haran , Abram , Lot ,</l>
     <l n="7">The youthful world 's gray fathers in one knot ,</l>
     <l n="8">Did with intentive looks watch every hour</l>
     <l n="9">For thy new light , and trembled at each shower ! ’</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Indeed , all Campbell 's ‘ Rainbow ’ is just a reflection of Vaughan 's , and reminds you of those faint , pale shadows of the heavenly bow you sometimes see in the darkened and disarranged skies of spring . To steal from , and then strike down the victim , is more suitable to robbers than to poets .</p>
   <p>Perhaps the best criticism on Vaughan may be found in the title of his own poems , ‘ Silex Scintillans . ’ He had a good deal of the dulness and hardness of the flint about his mind , but the influence of poverty and suffering ,— for true it is that</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">‘ Wretched men</l>
     <l n="2">Are cradled into poetry by wrong ;</l>
     <l n="3">They learn in suffering what they teach in song , ’ —</l>
   </lg>
   <p>and latterly the power of a genuine , though somewhat narrow piety , struck out glorious scintillations from the bare but rich rock . He ranks with Crashaw , Quarles , and Herbert , as one of the best of our early religious poets ; like them in their faults , and superior to all of them in refinement and beauty , if not in strength of genius .</p>

     <l n="19">Thus Cyrus tamed the Macedon ; a tomb</l>
     <l n="20">Checked him who thought the world too strait a room .</l>
     <l n="21">Have I obeyed the powers of a face ,</l>
     <l n="22">A beauty , able to undo the race</l>
     <l n="23">Of easy man ? I look but here , and straight</l>
     <l n="24">I am informed ; the lovely counterfeit</l>
     <l n="25">Was but a smoother clay . That famished slave ,</l>
     <l n="26">Beggared by wealth , who starves that he may save ,</l>
     <l n="27">Brings hither but his sheet . Nay , the ostrich-man ,</l>
     <l n="28">That feeds on steel and bullet , he that can</l>
     <l n="29">Outswear his lordship , and reply as tough</l>
     <l n="30">To a kind word , as if his tongue were buff ,</l>
     <l n="31">Is chapfallen here : worms , without wit or fear ,</l>
     <l n="32">Defy him now ; death has disarmed the bear .</l>
     <l n="33">Thus could I run o'er all the piteous score</l>
     <l n="34">Of erring men , and having done , meet more .</l>
     <l n="35">Their shuffled wills , abortive , vain intents ,</l>
     <l n="36">Fantastic humours , perilous ascents ,</l>
     <l n="37">False , empty honours , traitorous delights ,</l>
     <l n="38">And whatsoe'er a blind conceit invites ,—</l>
     <l n="39">But these , and more , which the weak vermins swell ,</l>
     <l n="40">Are couched in this accumulative cell ,</l>
     <l n="41">Which I could scatter ; but the grudging sun</l>
     <l n="42">Calls home his beams , and warns me to be gone :</l>
     <l n="43">Day leaves me in a double night , and I</l>
     <l n="44">Must bid farewell to my sad library ,</l>
     <l n="45">Yet with these notes . Henceforth with thought of thee</l>
     <l n="46">I 'll season all succeeding jollity ,</l>
     <l n="47">Yet damn not mirth , nor think too much is fit :</l>
     <l n="48">Excess hath no religion , nor wit ;</l>
     <l n="49">But should wild blood swell to a lawless strain ,</l>
     <l n="50">One check from thee shall channel it again .</l>

     <l n="1">I 've read thy soul 's fair night-piece , and have seen</l>
     <l n="2">The amours and courtship of the silent queen ;</l>
     <l n="3">Her stolen descents to earth , and what did move her</l>
     <l n="4">To juggle first with heaven , then with a lover ;</l>
     <l n="5">With Latmos ’ louder rescue , and , alas !</l>
     <l n="6">To find her out , a hue and cry in brass ;</l>
     <l n="7">Thy journal of deep mysteries , and sad</l>
     <l n="8">Nocturnal pilgrimage ; with thy dreams , clad</l>
     <l n="9">In fancies darker than thy cave ; thy glass</l>
     <l n="10">Of sleepy draughts ; and as thy soul did pass</l>
     <l n="11">In her calm voyage , what discourse she heard</l>
     <l n="12">Of spirits ; what dark groves and ill-shaped guard</l>
     <l n="13">Ismena led thee through ; with thy proud flight</l>
     <l n="14">O'er Periardes , and deep-musing night</l>
     <l n="15">Near fair Eurotas ’ banks ; what solemn green</l>
     <l n="16">The neighbour shades wear ; and what forms are seen</l>
     <l n="17">In their large bowers ; with that sad path and seat</l>
     <l n="18">Which none but light-heeled nymphs and fairies beat ,</l>
     <l n="19">Their solitary life , and how exempt</l>
     <l n="20">From common frailty , the severe contempt</l>
     <l n="21">They have of man , their privilege to live</l>
     <l n="22">A tree or fountain , and in that reprieve</l>
     <l n="23">What ages they consume : with the sad vale</l>
     <l n="24">Of Diophania ; and the mournful tale</l>
     <l n="25">Of the bleeding , vocal myrtle :— these and more ,</l>
     <l n="26">Thy richer thoughts , we are upon the score</l>
     <l n="27">To thy rare fancy for . Nor dost thou fall</l>
     <l n="28">From thy first majesty , or ought at all</l>
     <l n="29">Betray consumption . Thy full vigorous bays</l>
     <l n="30">Wear the same green , and scorn the lean decays</l>
     <l n="31">Of style or matter ; just as I have known</l>
     <l n="32">Some crystal spring , that from the neighbour down</l>
     <l n="33">Derived her birth , in gentle murmurs steal</l>
     <l n="34">To the next vale , and proudly there reveal</l>
     <l n="35">Her streams in louder accents , adding still</l>
     <l n="36">More noise and waters to her channel , till</l>
     <l n="37">At last , swollen with increase , she glides along</l>
     <l n="38">The lawns and meadows , in a wanton throng</l>
     <l n="39">Of frothy billows , and in one great name</l>
     <l n="40">Swallows the tributary brooks ’ drowned fame .</l>
     <l n="41">Nor are they mere inventions , for we</l>
     <l n="42">In the same piece find scattered philosophy ,</l>
     <l n="43">And hidden , dispersed truths , that folded lie</l>
     <l n="44">In the dark shades of deep allegory ,</l>
     <l n="45">So neatly weaved , like arras , they descry</l>
     <l n="46">Fables with truth , fancy with history .</l>
     <l n="47">So that thou hast , in this thy curious mould ,</l>
     <l n="48">Cast that commended mixture wished of old ,</l>
     <l n="49">Which shall these contemplations render far</l>
     <l n="50">Less mutable , and lasting as their star ;</l>
     <l n="51">And while there is a people , or a sun ,</l>
     <l n="52">Endymion 's story with the moon shall run .</l>

    <head>APOSTROPHE TO FLETCHER THE DRAMATIST .</head>
     <l n="1">I did believe , great Beaumont being dead ,</l>
     <l n="2">Thy widowed muse slept on his flowery bed .</l>
     <l n="3">But I am richly cozened , and can see</l>
     <l n="4">Wit transmigrates — his spirit stayed with thee ;</l>
     <l n="5">Which , doubly advantaged by thy single pen ,</l>
     <l n="6">In life and death now treads the stage again .</l>
     <l n="7">And thus are we freed from that dearth of wit</l>
     <l n="8">Which starved the land , since into schisms split ,</l>
     <l n="9">Wherein th ’ hast done so much , we must needs guess</l>
     <l n="10">Wit 's last edition is now i ’ the press .</l>
     <l n="11">For thou hast drained invention , and he</l>
     <l n="12">That writes hereafter , doth but pillage thee .</l>
     <l n="13">But thou hast plots ; and will not the Kirk strain</l>
     <l n="14">At the designs of such a tragic brain ?</l>
     <l n="15">Will they themselves think safe , when they shall see</l>
     <l n="16">Thy most abominable policy ?</l>
     <l n="17">Will not the Ears assemble , and think't fit</l>
     <l n="18">Their synod fast and pray against thy wit ?</l>
     <l n="19">But they 'll not tire in such an idle quest —</l>
     <l n="20">Thou dost but kill and circumvent in jest ;</l>
     <l n="21">And when thy angered muse swells to a blow ,</l>
     <l n="22">Tis but for Field 's or Swansteed 's overthrow .</l>
     <l n="23">Yet shall these conquests of thy bays outlive</l>
     <l n="24">Their Scottish zeal , and compacts made to grieve</l>
     <l n="25">The peace of spirits ; and when such deeds fail</l>
     <l n="26">Of their foul ends , a fair name is thy bail .</l>
     <l n="27">But , happy ! thou ne'er saw'st these storms our air</l>
     <l n="28">Teemed with , even in thy time , though seeming fair .</l>
     <l n="29">Thy gentle soul , meant for the shade and ease</l>
     <l n="30">Withdrew betimes into the land of peace .</l>
     <l n="31">So , nested in some hospitable shore ,</l>
     <l n="32">The hermit-angler , when the mid seas roar ,</l>
     <l n="33">Packs up his lines , and ere the tempest raves ,</l>
     <l n="34">Retires , and leaves his station to the waves .</l>
     <l n="35">Thus thou diedst almost with our peace ; and we ,</l>
     <l n="36">This breathing time , thy last fair issue see ,</l>
     <l n="37">Which I think such , if needless ink not soil</l>
     <l n="38">So choice a muse , others are but thy foil ;</l>
     <l n="39">This or that age may write , but never see</l>
     <l n="40">A wit that dares run parallel with thee .</l>
     <l n="41">True Ben must live ; but bate him , and thou hast</l>
     <l n="42">Undone all future wits , and matched the past .</l>

     <l n="3">No soft luxurious diet then</l>

     <l n="9">No pompous wear was in those days ,</l>
     <l n="10">Of gummy silks , or scarlet baize .</l>
     <l n="11">Their beds were on some flowery brink ,</l>
     <l n="12">And clear spring water was their drink .</l>
     <l n="13">The shady pine , in the sun 's heat ,</l>

     <l n="78">And even my soul to thee is dead ;</l>
     <l n="79">Only in him , on whom I feast ,</l>
     <l n="80">Both soul and body are well dressed ;</l>
     <l n="81">His pure perfection quits all score ,</l>
     <l n="82">And fills the boxes of his poor ;</l>
     <l n="83">He is the centre of long life and light ;</l>
     <l n="84">I am but finite , he is infinite .</l>

    <head>ABEL 'S BLOOD .</head>

     <l n="2">Did first against a murderer cry ;</l>
     <l n="3">Whose streams , still vocal , still complain</l>
     <l n="4">Of bloody Cain ;</l>
     <l n="5">And now at evening are as red</l>

     <l n="7">If single thou ,</l>
     <l n="8">Though single voices are but low ,</l>
     <l n="9">Couldst such a shrill and long cry rear</l>
     <l n="10">As speaks still in thy Maker 's ear ,</l>
     <l n="11">What thunders shall those men arraign</l>
     <l n="12">Who cannot count those they have slain ,</l>
     <l n="13">Who bathe not in a shallow flood ,</l>
     <l n="14">But in a deep , wide sea of blood —</l>
     <l n="15">A sea whose loud waves cannot sleep ,</l>
     <l n="16">But deep still calleth upon deep ;</l>
     <l n="17">Whose urgent sound , like unto that</l>
     <l n="18">Of many waters , beateth at</l>
     <l n="19">The everlasting doors above ,</l>
     <l n="20">Where souls behind the altar move ,</l>
     <l n="21">And with one strong , incessant cry</l>
     <l n="22">Inquire ‘ How long ? ’ of the Most High ?</l>
     <l n="23">Almighty Judge !</l>
     <l n="24">At whose just laws no just men grudge ;</l>
     <l n="25">Whose blessed , sweet commands do pour</l>
     <l n="26">Comforts and joys and hopes each hour</l>
     <l n="27">On those that keep them ; oh , accept</l>
     <l n="28">Of his vowed heart , whom thou hast kept</l>
     <l n="29">From bloody men ! and grant I may</l>
     <l n="30">That sworn memorial duly pay</l>
     <l n="31">To thy bright arm , which was my light</l>
     <l n="32">And leader through thick death and night !</l>
     <l n="33">Aye may that flood ,</l>
     <l n="34">That proudly spilt and despised blood ,</l>
     <l n="35">Speechless and calm as infants sleep !</l>
     <l n="36">Or if it watch , forgive and weep</l>
     <l n="37">For those that spilt it ! May no cries</l>
     <l n="38">From the low earth to high heaven rise ,</l>
     <l n="39">But what , like his whose blood peace brings ,</l>
     <l n="40">Shall , when they rise , speak better things</l>
     <l n="41">Than Abel 's doth ! May Abel be</l>
     <l n="42">Still single heard , while these agree</l>
     <l n="43">With his mild blood in voice and will ,</l>

   <p>DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT .</p>
   <p>This writer , though little known , appears to us to stand as high almost as any name in the present volume , and we are proud to reprint here some considerable specimens of his magnificent poetry .</p>
   <p>Joseph Beaumont was sprung from a collateral branch of the ancient family of the Beaumonts , that family from which sprung Sir John Beaumont , the author of ‘ Bosworth Field , ’ and Francis Beaumont , the celebrated dramatist . He was born at Hadleigh , in Suffolk . Of his early life nothing is known . He received his education at Cambridge , where , during the Civil War , he was fellow and tutor of Peterhouse . Ejected by the Republicans from his offices , he retired to Hadleigh , and spent his time in the com - position of his magnum opus , ‘ Psyche . ’ This poem appeared in 1648 ; and in 1702 , three years after the author 's death , his son published a second edition , with numerous corrections , and the addition of four cantos by the author . Beaumont also wrote several minor pieces in English and Latin , a controversial tract in reply to Henry More 's ‘ Mystery of Godliness , ’ and several theological works which are still in MS ., according to a provision in his will to that effect . Peace and perpetuity to their slumbers !</p>
   <p>After the Restoration , our author was not only reinstated in his former situations , but received from his patron , Bishop Wren , several valuable pieces of preferment besides . Afterwards , he exercised successively the offices of Master of Jesus and of Peterhouse , and was King 's Professor of Divinity from 1670 to 1699 . In the latter year he died .</p>
   <p>While praising the genius of Beaumont , we are far from commending his ‘ Psyche , ’ either as an artistic whole , or as a readable book . It is , sooth to say , a dull allegory , in twenty-four immense cantos , studded with the rarest beauties . It is considerably longer than the ‘ Faery Queen , ’ nearly four times the length of the ‘ Paradise Lost , ’ and five or six times as long as the ‘ Excursion . ’ To read it through now-a-days were to perform a purgatorial penance . But the imagination and fancy are Spenserian , his colouring is often Titianesque in gorgeousness , and his pictures of shadows , abstractions , and all fantastic forms , are so forcible as to seem to start from the canvas . In painting the beautiful , his verse becomes careless and flowing as a loosened zone ; in painting the frightful and the infernal , his language , like his feeling , seems to curdle and stiffen in horror , as where , speaking of Satan , he says —</p>

     <l n="1">‘ His tawny teeth</l>
     <l n="2">Were ragged grown , by endless gnashing at</l>
     <l n="3">The dismal riddle of his living death . ’</l>

   <p>The ‘ Psyche ’ may be compared to a palace of Fairyland , where successive doors fly open to the visitor — one revealing a banqueting-room filled with the materials of exuberant mirth ; another , an enchanted garden , with streams stealing from grottos , and nymphs gliding through groves ; a third conducting you to a dungeon full of dead men 's bones and all uncleanness ; a fourth , to a pit which seems the mouth of hell , and whence cries of torture come up , shaking the smoke that ascendeth up for ever and ever ; and a fifth , to the open roof , over which the stars are seen bending , and the far-off heavens are opening in glory ; and of these doors there is no end . We saw , when lately in Copenhagen , the famous tower of the Trinity Church , remarkable for the grand view commanded from the summit , and for the broad spiral ascent winding within it almost to the top , up which it is said Peter the Great , in 1716 , used to drive himself and his Empress in a coach-and-four . It was curious to feel ourselves ascending on a path nearly level , and without the slightest perspiration or fatigue ; and here , we thought , is the desiderated ‘ royal road ’ to difficulties fairly found . Large poems should be constructed on the same principle ; their quiet , broad interest should beguile their readers alike to their length and their loftiness . It is exactly the reverse with ‘ Psyche . ’ But if any reader is wearied of some of the extracts we have given , such as his verses on ‘ Eve , ’ on ‘ Paradise , ’ on ‘ End , ’ on ‘ The Death of his Wife , ’ and on ‘ Imperial Rome , ’ we shall be very much disposed to question his capacity for appreciating true poetry .</p>
