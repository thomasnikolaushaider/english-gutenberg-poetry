    <head>PREFACE</head>
    <p n="1">In Mr. Cabot 's prefatory note to the Riverside Edition of the Poems , published the year after Mr. Emerson 's death , he said :—</p>
    <p n="2">“ This volume contains nearly all the pieces included in the POEMS and MAY-DAY of former editions . In 1876 , Mr. Emerson published a selection from his Poems , adding six new ones and omitting many<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>. Of those omitted , several are now restored , in accordance with the expressed wishes of many readers and lovers of them . Also some pieces never before published are here given in an Appendix ; on various grounds . Some of them appear to have had Mr. Emerson 's approval , but to have been withheld because they were unfinished . These it seemed best not to suppress , now that they can never receive their completion . Others , mostly of an early date , remained unpublished , doubtless because of their personal and private nature . Some of these seem to have an autobiographic interest sufficient to justify their publication . Others again , often mere fragments , have been admitted as characteristic , or as expressing in poetic form thoughts found in the Essays .</p>
    <p n="3"><span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>Selected Poems : Little Classic Edition .</p>
    <p n="4">“ In coming to a decision in these cases it seemed , on the whole , preferable to take the risk of including too much rather than the opposite , and to leave the task of further winnowing to the hands of Time .</p>
    <p n="5">“ As was stated in the preface to the first volume of this edition of Mr. Emerson 's writings , the readings adopted by him in the Selected Poems have not always been followed here , but in some cases preference has been given to corrections made by him when he was in fuller strength than at the time of the last revision .</p>
    <p n="6">“ A change in the arrangement of the stanzas of ‘ May-Day , ’ in the part representative of the march of Spring , received his sanction as bringing them more nearly in accordance with the events in Nature . ”</p>
    <p n="7">In the preparation of the Riverside Edition of the Poems , Mr. Cabot very considerately took the present editor into counsel ( as representing Mr. Emerson 's family ) , who at that time in turn took counsel with several persons of taste and mature judgment with regard especially to the admission of poems hitherto unpublished and of fragments that seemed interested and pleasing . Mr. Cabot and he were entirely in accord with regard to the Riverside Edition . In the present edition , the substance of the Riverside Edition has been preserved , with hardly an exception , although some poems and fragments have been added . None of the poems therein printed have been omitted . “ The House , ” which appeared in the first volume of Poems , and “ Nemesis , ” “ Una , ” “ Love and Thought ” and “ Merlin 's Songs , ” from the May-Day volume , have been restored . To the few mottoes of the Essays , which Mr. Emerson printed as “ Elements ” in May-Day , most of the others have been added . Following Mr. Emerson 's precedent of giving his brother Edward 's “ Last Farewell ” a place beside the poem in his memory , two pleasing poems by Ellen Tucker , his first wife , which he published in the Dial , have been placed with his own poems relating to her . The publication in the last edition of some poems that Mr. Emerson had long kept by him , but had never quite been ready to print , and of various fragments on Poetry , Nature and Life , was not done without advice and careful consideration , and then was felt to be perhaps a rash experiment . The continued interest which has been shown in the author 's thought and methods and life — for these unfinished pieces contain much autobiography — has made the present editor feel it justifiable to keep almost all of these and to add a few . Their order has been slightly altered .</p>
    <p n="8">A few poems from the verse-books sufficiently complete to have a title are printed in the Appendix for the first time : “ Insight , ” “ September , ” “ October , ” “ Hymn ” and “ Riches . ”</p>
    <p n="9">After much hesitation the editor has gathered in their order of time , and printed at the end of the book , some twenty early pieces , a few of them taken from the Appendix of the last edition and others never printed before . They are for the most part journals in verse covering the period of his school-teaching , study for the ministry and exercise of that office , his sickness , bereavement , travel abroad and return to the new life . This sad period of probation is illuminated by the episode of his first love . Not for their poetical merit , except in flashes , but for the light they throw on the growth of his thought and character are they included .</p>
    <p n="10">In this volume the course of the Muse , as Emerson tells it , is pursued with regard to his own poems .</p>
    <p n="11">I hang my verses in the wind , Time and tide their faults will find .</p>

   <p>BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH</p>
   <p>The Emersons first appeared in the north of England , but Thomas , who landed in Massachusetts in 1638 , came from Hertfordshire . He built soon after a house , sometimes railed the Saint 's Rest , which still stands in Ipswich on the slope of Heart-break Hill , close by Labour-in-vain Creek . Ralph Waldo Emerson was the sixth in descent from him . He was born in Boston , in Summer Street , May 25 , 1803 . He was the third son of William Emerson , the minister of the First Church in Boston , whose father , William Emerson , had been the patriotic minister of Concord at the outbreak of the Revolution , and died a chaplain in the army . Ruth Haskins , the mother of Ralph Waldo Emerson , was left a widow in 1811 , with a family of five little boys . The taste of these boys was scholarly , and four of them went through the Latin School to Harvard College , and graduated there . Their mother was a person of great sweetness , dignity , and piety , bringing up her sons wisely and well in very straitened circumstances , and loved by them . Her husband 's stepfather , Rev . Dr. Ripley of Concord , helped her , and constantly invited the boys to the Old Manse , so that the woods and fields along the Concord River were first a playground and then the background of the dreams of their awakening imaginations .</p>
   <p>Born in the city , Emerson 's young mind first found delight in poems and classic prose , to which his instincts led him as naturally as another boy 's would to go fishing , but his vacations in the country supplemented these by giving him great and increasing love of nature . In his early poems classic imagery is woven into pictures of New England woodlands . Even as a little boy he had the habit of attempting flights of verse , stimulated by Milton , Pope , or Scott , and he and his mates took pleasure in declaiming to each other in barns and attics . He was so full of thoughts and fancies that he sought the pen instinctively , to jot them down .</p>
   <p>At college Emerson did not shine as a scholar , though he won prizes for essays and declamations , being especially unfitted for mathematical studies , and enjoying the classics rather in a literary than grammatical way . And yet it is doubtful whether any man in his class used his time to better purpose with reference to his after life , for young Emerson 's instinct led him to wide reading of works , outside the curriculum , that spoke directly to him . He had already formed the habit of writing in a journal , not the facts but the thoughts and inspirations of the day ; often , also , good stories or poetical quotations , and scraps of his own verse .</p>
   <p>On graduation from Harvard in the class of 1821 , following the traditions of his family , Emerson resolved to study to be a minister , and meantime helped his older brother William in the support of the family by teaching in a school for young ladies in Boston , that the former had successfully established . The principal was twenty-one and the assistant nineteen years of age . For school-teaching on the usual lines Emerson was not fitted , and his youth and shyness prevented him from imparting his best gifts to his scholars . Years later , when , in his age , his old scholars assembled to greet him , he regretted that no hint had been brought into the school of what at that very time “ I was writing every night in my chamber , my first thoughts on morals and the beautiful laws of compensation , and of individual genius , which to observe and illustrate have given sweetness to many years of my life . ” Yet many scholars remembered his presence and teaching with pleasure and gratitude , not only in Boston , but in Chelmsford and Roxbury , for while his younger brothers were in college it was necessary that he should help . In these years , as through all his youth , he was loved , spurred on in his intellectual life , and keenly criticised by his aunt , Mary Moody Emerson , an eager and wide reader , inspired by religious zeal , high-minded , but eccentric .</p>
   <p>The health of the young teacher suffered from too ascetic a life , and unmistakable danger-signals began to appear , fortunately heeded in time , but disappointment and delay resulted , borne , however , with sense and courage . His course at the Divinity School in Cambridge was much broken ; nevertheless , in October , 1826 , he was “ approbated to preach ” by the Middlesex Association of Ministers . A winter at the North at this time threatened to prove fatal , so he was sent South by his helpful kinsman , Rev . Samuel Ripley , and passed the winter in Florida with benefit , working northward in the spring , preaching in the cities , and resumed his studies at Cambridge .</p>
   <p>In 1829 , Emerson was called by the Second or Old North Church in Boston to become the associate pastor with Rev . Henry Ware , and soon after , because of his senior 's delicate health , was called on to assume the full duty . Theological dogmas , such as the Unitarian Church of Channing 's day accepted , did not appeal to Emerson , nor did the supernatural in religion in its ordinary acceptation interest him . The omnipresence of spirit , the dignity of man , the daily miracle of the universe , were what he taught , and while the older members of the congregation may have been disquieted that he did not dwell on revealed religion , his words reached the young people , stirred thought , and awakened aspiration . At this time he lived with his mother and his young wife ( Ellen Tucker ) in Chardon Street . For three years he ministered to his people in Boston . Then having felt the shock of being obliged to conform to church usage , as stated prayer when the spirit did not move , and especially the administration of the Communion , he honestly laid his troubles before his people , and proposed to them some modification of this rite . While they considered his proposition , Emerson went into the White Mountains to weigh his conflicting duties to his church and conscience . He came down , bravely to meet the refusal of the church to change the rite , and in a sermon preached in September , 1832 , explained his objections to it , and , because he could not honestly administer it , resigned .</p>
   <p>He parted from his people in all kindness , but the wrench was felt . His wife had recently died , he was ill himself , his life seemed to others broken up . But meantime voices from far away had reached him . He sailed for Europe , landed in Italy , saw cities , and art , and men , but would not stay long . Of the dead , Michael Angelo appealed chiefly to him there ; Landor among the living . He soon passed northward , making little stay in Paris , but sought out Carlyle , then hardly recognized , and living in the lonely hills of the Scottish Border . There began a friendship which had great influence on the lives of both men , and lasted through life . He also visited Wordsworth . But the new life before him called him home .</p>
   <p>He landed at Boston within the year in good health and hope , and joined his mother and youngest brother Charles in Newton . Frequent invitations to preach still came , and were accepted , and he even was sounded as to succeeding Dr. Dewey in the church at New Bedford ; but , as he stipulated for freedom from ceremonial , this came to nothing .</p>
   <p>In the autumn of 1834 he moved to Concord , living with his kinsman , Dr. Ripley , at the Manse , but soon bought house and land on the Boston Road , on the edge of the village towards Walden woods . Thither , in the autumn , he brought his wife . Miss Lidian Jackson , of Plymouth , and this was their home during the rest of their lives .</p>
   <p>The new life to which he had been called opened pleasantly and increased in happiness and opportunity , except for the sadness of bereavements , for , in the first few years , his brilliant brothers Edward and Charles died , and soon afterward Waldo , his firstborn son , and later his mother . Emerson had left traditional religion , the city , the Old World , behind , and now went to Nature as his teacher , his inspiration . His first book , “ Nature , ” which he was meditating while in Europe , was finished here , and published in 1836 . His practice during all his life in Concord was to go alone to the woods almost daily , sometimes to wait there for hours , and , when thus attuned , to receive the message to which he was to give voice . Though it might be colored by him in transmission , he held that the light was universal .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Ever the words of the Gods resound ,</l>
     <l n="2">But the porches of man 's ear</l>
     <l n="3">Seldom in this low life 's round</l>
     <l n="4">Are unsealed that he may hear . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>But he resorted , also , to the books of those who had handed down the oracles truly , and was quick to find the message destined for him . Men , too , he studied eagerly , the humblest and the highest , regretting always that the brand of the scholar on him often silenced the men of shop and office where he came . He was everywhere a learner , expecting light from the youngest and least educated visitor . The thoughts combined with the flower of his reading were gradually grouped into lectures , and his main occupation through life was reading these to who would hear , at first in courses in Boston , but later all over the country , for the Lyceum sprang up in New England in these years in every town , and spread westward to the new settlements even beyond the Mississippi . His winters were spent in these rough , but to him interesting journeys , for he loved to watch the growth of the Republic in which he had faith , and his summers were spent in study and writing . These lectures were later severely pruned and revised , and the best of them gathered into seven volumes of essays under different names between 1841 and 1876 . The courses in Boston , which at first were given in the Masonic Temple , were always well attended by earnest and thoughtful people . The young , whether in years or in spirit , were always and to the end his audience of the spoken or written word . The freedom of the Lyceum platform pleased Emerson . He found that people would hear on Wednesday with approval and unsuspectingly doctrines from which on Sunday they felt officially obliged to dissent .</p>
   <p>Mr. Lowell , in his essays , has spoken of these early lectures and what they were worth to him and others suffering from the generous discontent of youth with things as they were . Emerson used to say , “ My strength and my doom is to be solitary ; ” but to a retired scholar a wholesome offset to this was the travelling and lecturing in cities and in raw frontier towns , bringing him into touch with the people , and this he knew and valued .</p>
   <p>In 1837 Emerson gave the Phi Beta Kappa oration in Cambridge , The American Scholar , which increased his growing reputation , but the following year his Address to the Senior Class at the Divinity School brought out , even from the friendly Unitarians , severe strictures and warnings against its dangerous doctrines . Of this heresy Emerson said : “ I deny personality to God because it is too little , not too much . ” He really strove to elevate the idea of God . Yet those who were pained or shocked by his teachings respected Emerson . His lectures were still in demand ; he was often asked to speak by literary societies at orthodox colleges . He preached regularly at East Lexington until 1838 , but thereafter withdrew from the ministerial office . At this time the progressive and spiritually minded young people used to meet for discussion and help in Boston , among them George Ripley , Cyrus Bartol , James Freeman Clarke , Alcott , Dr . Hedge , Margaret Fuller , and Elizabeth Peabody . Perhaps from this gathering of friends , which Emerson attended , came what is called the Transcendental Movement , two results of which were the Brook Farm Community and the Dial magazine , in which last Emerson took great interest , and was for the time an editor . Many of these friends were frequent visitors in Concord . Alcott moved thither after the breaking up of his school . Hawthorne also came to dwell there . Henry Thoreau , a Concord youth , greatly interested Emerson ; indeed , became for a year or two a valued inmate of his home , and helped and instructed him in the labors of the garden and little farm , which gradually grew to ten acres , the chief interest of which for the owner was his trees , which he loved and tended . Emerson helped introduce his countrymen to the teachings of Carlyle , and edited his works here , where they found more readers than at home .</p>
   <p>In 1847 Emerson was invited to read lectures in England , and remained abroad a year , visiting France also in her troublous times . English Traits was a result . Just before this journey he had collected and published his poems . A later volume , called May Day , followed in 1867 . He had written verses from childhood , and to the purified expression of poetry he , through life , eagerly aspired . He said , “ I like my poems best because it is not I who write them . ” In 1866 the degree of Doctor of Laws was conferred on him by Harvard University , and he was chosen an Overseer . In 1867 he again gave the Phi Beta Kappa oration , and in 1870 and 1871 gave courses in Philosophy in the University Lectures at Cambridge .</p>
   <p>Emerson was not merely a man of letters . He recognized and did the private and public duties of the hour . He exercised a wide hospitality to souls as well as bodies . Eager youths came to him for rules , and went away with light . Reformers , wise and unwise , came to him , and were kindly received . They were often disappointed that they could not harness him to their partial and transient scheme . He said , My reforms include theirs : I must go my way ; help people by my strength , not by my weakness . But if a storm threatened , he felt bound to appear and show his colors . Against the crying evils of his time he worked bravely in his own way . He wrote to President Van Buren against the wrong done to the Cherokees , dared speak against the idolized Webster , when he deserted the cause of Freedom , constantly spoke of the iniquity of slavery , aided with speech and money the Free State cause in Kansas , was at Phillips 's side at the antislavery meeting in 1861 broken up by the Boston mob , urged emancipation during the war .</p>
   <p>He enjoyed his Concord home and neighbors , served on the school committee for years , did much for the Lyceum , and spoke on the town 's great occasions . He went to all town-meetings , oftener to listen and admire than to speak , and always took pleasure and pride in the people . In return he was respected and loved by them .</p>
   <p>Emerson 's house was destroyed by fire in 1872 , and the incident exposure and fatigue did him harm . His many friends insisted on rebuilding his house and sending him abroad to get well . He went up the Nile , and revisited England , finding old and new friends , and , on his return , was welcomed and escorted home by the people of Concord . After this time he was unable to write . His old age was quiet and happy among his family and friends . He died in April , 1882 .</p>

     <l n="34">Like the bird from the woodlands to the cage ;—</l>
     <l n="35">The gay enchantment was undone ,</l>
     <l n="36">A gentle wife , but fairy none .</l>
     <l n="37">Then I said , ‘ I covet truth ;</l>

     <l n="39">I leave it behind with the games of youth : ’ —</l>
     <l n="40">As I spoke , beneath my feet</l>
     <l n="41">The ground-pine curled its pretty wreath ,</l>
     <l n="42">Running over the club-moss burrs ;</l>
     <l n="43">I inhaled the violet 's breath ;</l>
     <l n="44">Around me stood the oaks and firs ;</l>
     <l n="45">Pine-cones and acorns lay on the ground ;</l>
     <l n="46">Over me soared the eternal sky .</l>
     <l n="47">Full of light and of deity ;</l>
     <l n="48">Again I saw , again I heard ,</l>
     <l n="49">The rolling river , the morning bird ;—</l>
     <l n="50">Beauty through my senses stole ;</l>

     <l n="37">They prove the virtues of each bed of rock ,</l>
     <l n="38">And , like the chemist ‘ mid his loaded jars ,</l>
     <l n="39">Draw from each stratum its adapted use</l>
     <l n="40">To drug their crops or weapon their arts withal .</l>
     <l n="41">They turn the frost upon their chemic heap ,</l>
     <l n="42">They set the wind to winnow pulse and grain ,</l>
     <l n="43">They thank the spring-flood for its fertile slime ,</l>
     <l n="44">And , on cheap summit-levels of the snow ,</l>

     <l n="48">( That one would say , meadow and forest walked ,</l>
     <l n="49">Transmuted in these men to rule their like ) ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="52">What these strong masters wrote at large in miles ,</l>
     <l n="53">I followed in small copy in my acre ;</l>
     <l n="54">For there 's no rood has not a star above it ;</l>
     <l n="55">The cordial quality of pear or plum</l>
     <l n="56">Ascends as gladly in a single tree</l>
     <l n="57">As in broad orchards resonant with bees ;</l>
     <l n="58">And every atom poises for itself ,</l>
     <l n="59">And for the whole . The gentle deities</l>
     <l n="60">Showed me the lore of colors and of sounds ,</l>
     <l n="61">The innumerable tenements of beauty .</l>
     <l n="62">The miracle of generative force ,</l>
     <l n="63">Far-reaching concords of astronomy</l>
     <l n="64">Felt in the plants and in the punctual birds ;</l>
     <l n="65">Better , the linked purpose of the whole ,</l>
     <l n="66">And , chiefest prize , found I true liberty</l>
     <l n="67">In the glad home plain-dealing Nature gave .</l>
     <l n="68">The polite found me impolite ; the great</l>
     <l n="69">Would mortify me , but in vain ; for still</l>
     <l n="70">I am a willow of the wilderness ,</l>
     <l n="71">Loving the wind that bent me . All my hurts</l>
     <l n="72">My garden spade can heal . A woodland walk ,</l>
     <l n="73">A quest of river-grapes , a mocking thrush ,</l>
     <l n="74">A wild-rose , or rock-loving columbine ,</l>
     <l n="75">Salve my worst wounds .</l>
     <l n="76">For thus the wood-gods murmured in my ear :</l>
     <l n="77">‘ Dost love our manners ? Canst thou silent lie ?</l>
     <l n="78">Canst thou , thy pride forgot , like Nature pass</l>
     <l n="79">Into the winter night 's extinguished mood ?</l>
     <l n="80">Canst thou shine now , then darkle ,</l>
     <l n="81">And being latent , feel thyself no less ?</l>
     <l n="82">As , when the all-worshipped moon attracts the eye ,</l>
     <l n="83">The river , hill , stems , foliage are obscure ,</l>
     <l n="84">Yet envies none , none are unenviable . ’</l>

     <l n="35">When late I walked , in earlier days ,</l>

     <l n="38">In the sky no spark ;</l>
     <l n="39">Firm-braced I sought my ancient woods ,</l>
     <l n="40">Struggling through the drifted roads ;</l>
     <l n="41">The whited desert knew me not ,</l>
     <l n="42">Snow-ridges masked each darling spot ;</l>
     <l n="43">The summer dells , by genius haunted ,</l>
     <l n="44">One arctic moon had disenchanted .</l>
     <l n="45">All the sweet secrets therein hid</l>
     <l n="46">By Fancy , ghastly spells undid .</l>
     <l n="47">Eldest mason , Frost , had piled</l>

     <l n="57">Without the baffled North-wind calls .</l>
     <l n="58">But soft ! a sultry morning breaks ;</l>

     <l n="60">The maple-tops their crimson tint ,</l>
     <l n="61">On the soft path each track is seen ,</l>
     <l n="62">The girl 's foot leaves its neater print .</l>
     <l n="63">The pebble loosened from the frost</l>
     <l n="64">Asks of the urchin to be tost .</l>

     <l n="72">He dives the hollow , climbs the steep .</l>
     <l n="73">The youth sees omens where he goes ,</l>
     <l n="74">And speaks all languages the rose ,</l>
     <l n="75">The wood-fly mocks with tiny voice</l>
     <l n="76">The far halloo of human voice ;</l>
     <l n="77">The perfumed berry on the spray</l>
     <l n="78">Smacks of faint memories far away .</l>
     <l n="79">A subtle chain of countless rings</l>
     <l n="80">The next into the farthest brings ,</l>
     <l n="81">And , striving to be man , the worm</l>

     <l n="93">Of Eden 's bower some dream-like trace</l>
     <l n="94">Survived the Flight and swam the Flood ,</l>

     <l n="1">Wise and polite ,— and if I drew</l>
     <l n="2">Their several portraits , you would own</l>

     <l n="5">We crossed Champlain to Keeseville with our friends ,</l>
     <l n="6">Thence , in strong country carts , rode up the forks</l>
     <l n="7">Of the Ausable stream , intent to reach</l>
     <l n="8">The Adirondac lakes . At Martin 's Beach</l>
     <l n="9">We chose our boats ; each man a boat and guide ,—</l>
     <l n="10">Ten men , ten guides , our company all told .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="11">Next morn , we swept with oars the Saranac ,</l>
     <l n="12">With skies of benediction , to Round Lake ,</l>
     <l n="13">Where all the sacred mountains drew around us ,</l>
     <l n="14">Taháwus , Seaward , MacIntyre , Baldhead ,</l>
     <l n="15">And other Titans without muse or name .</l>
     <l n="16">Pleased with these grand companions , we glide on ,</l>
     <l n="17">Instead of flowers , crowned with a wreath of hills .</l>
     <l n="18">We made our distance wider , boat from boat ,</l>
     <l n="19">As each would hear the oracle alone .</l>
     <l n="20">By the bright morn the gay flotilla slid</l>
     <l n="21">Through files of flags that gleamed like bayonets ,</l>
     <l n="22">Through gold-moth-haunted beds of pickerel-flower ,</l>
     <l n="23">Through scented banks of lilies white and gold ,</l>
     <l n="24">Where the deer feeds at night , the teal by day ,</l>
     <l n="25">On through the Upper Saranac , and up</l>
     <l n="26">Père Raquette stream , to a small tortuous pass</l>
     <l n="27">Winding through grassy shallows in and out ,</l>
     <l n="28">Two creeping miles of rushes , pads and sponge ,</l>
     <l n="29">To Follansbee Water and the Lake of Loons .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="30">Northward the length of Follansbee we rowed ,</l>
     <l n="31">Under low mountains , whose unbroken ridge</l>
     <l n="32">Ponderous with beechen forest sloped the shore .</l>
     <l n="33">A pause and council : then , where near the head</l>
     <l n="34">Due east a bay makes inward to the land</l>
     <l n="35">Between two rocky arms , we climb the bank ,</l>
     <l n="36">And in the twilight of the forest noon</l>
     <l n="37">Wield the first axe these echoes ever heard .</l>
     <l n="38">We cut young trees to make our poles and thwarts ,</l>
     <l n="39">Barked the white spruce to weatherfend the roof ,</l>
     <l n="40">Then struck a light and kindled the camp-fire .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="41">The wood was sovran with centennial trees ,—</l>
     <l n="42">Oak , cedar , maple , poplar , beech and fir ,</l>
     <l n="43">Linden and spruce . In strict society</l>
     <l n="44">Three conifers , white , pitch and Norway pine ,</l>
     <l n="45">Five-leaved , three-leaved and two-leaved , grew thereby ,</l>
     <l n="46">Our patron pine was fifteen feet in girth ,</l>
     <l n="47">The maple eight , beneath its shapely tower .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="48">‘ Welcome ! ’ the wood-god murmured through the leaves ,—</l>
     <l n="49">‘ Welcome , though late , unknowing , yet known to me . ’</l>
     <l n="50">Evening drew on ; stars peeped through maple-boughs ,</l>
     <l n="51">Which o'erhung , like a cloud , our camping fire .</l>
     <l n="52">Decayed millennial trunks , like moonlight flecks ,</l>
     <l n="53">Lit with phosphoric crumbs the forest floor .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="54">Ten scholars , wonted to lie warm and soft</l>
     <l n="55">In well-hung chambers daintily bestowed ,</l>
     <l n="56">Lie here on hemlock-boughs , like Sacs and Sioux ,</l>
     <l n="57">And greet unanimous the joyful change .</l>
     <l n="58">So fast will Nature acclimate her sons ,</l>
     <l n="59">Though late returning to her pristine ways .</l>
     <l n="60">Off soundings , seamen do not suffer cold ;</l>
     <l n="61">And , in the forest , delicate clerks , unbrowned ,</l>
     <l n="62">Sleep on the fragrant brush , as on down-beds .</l>
     <l n="63">Up with the dawn , they fancied the light air</l>
     <l n="64">That circled freshly in their forest dress</l>
     <l n="65">Made them to boys again . Happier that they</l>
     <l n="66">Slipped off their pack of duties , leagues behind ,</l>
     <l n="67">At the first mounting of the giant stairs .</l>
     <l n="68">No placard on these rocks warned to the polls ,</l>
     <l n="69">No door-bell heralded a visitor ,</l>
     <l n="70">No courier waits , no letter came or went ,</l>
     <l n="71">Nothing was ploughed , or reaped , or bought , or sold ;</l>
     <l n="72">The frost might glitter , it would blight no crop ,</l>
     <l n="73">The falling rain will spoil no holiday .</l>
     <l n="74">We were made freemen of the forest laws ,</l>
     <l n="75">All dressed , like Nature , fit for her own ends ,</l>
     <l n="76">Essaying nothing she cannot perform .</l>

     <l n="82">A paddle in the right hand , or an oar ,</l>

     <l n="84">By turns we praised the stature of our guides ,</l>

    <head>APPENDIX</head>
    <p n="1">THE POET</p>
    <p n="2">I</p>
    <p n="3">Right upward on the road of fame With sounding steps the poet came ; Born and nourished in miracles , His feet were shod with golden bells , Or where he stepped the soil did peal As if the dust were glass and steel . The gallant child where'er he came Threw to each fact a tuneful name . The things whereon he cast his eyes Could not the nations rebaptize , Nor Time 's snows hide the names he set , Nor last posterity forget . Yet every scroll whereon he wrote In latent fire his secret thought , Fell unregarded to the ground , Unseen by such as stood around . The pious wind took it away , The reverent darkness hid the lay . Methought like water-haunting birds Divers or dippers were his words , And idle clowns beside the mere At the new vision gape and jeer . But when the noisy scorn was past , Emerge the wingèd words in haste . New-bathed , new-trimmed , on healthy wing , Right to the heaven they steer and sing .</p>
    <p n="4">A Brother of the world , his song Sounded like a tempest strong Which tore from oaks their branches broad , And stars from the ecliptic road . Times wore he as his clothing-weeds , He sowed the sun and moon for seeds . As melts the iceberg in the seas , As clouds give rain to the eastern breeze , As snow-banks thaw in April 's beam , The solid kingdoms like a dream Resist in vain his motive strain , They totter now and float amain . For the Muse gave special charge His learning should be deep and large , And his training should not scant The deepest lore of wealth or want : His flesh should feel , his eyes should read Every maxim of dreadful Need ; In its fulness he should taste Life 's honeycomb , but not too fast ; Full fed , but not intoxicated ; He should be loved ; he should be hated ; A blooming child to children dear , His heart should palpitate with fear .</p>
    <p n="5">And well he loved to quit his home And , Calmuck , in his wagon roam To read new landscapes and old skies ;— But oh , to see his solar eyes Like meteors which chose their way And rived the dark like a new day ! Not lazy grazing on all they saw , Each chimney-pot and cottage door , Farm-gear and village picket-fence , But , feeding on magnificence , They bounded to the horizon 's edge And searched with the sun 's privilege . Landward they reached the mountains old Where pastoral tribes their flocks infold , Saw rivers run seaward by cities high And the seas wash the low-hung sky ; Saw the endless rack of the firmament And the sailing moon where the cloud was rent , And through man and woman and sea and star Saw the dance of Nature forward and far , Through worlds and races and terms and times Saw musical order and pairing rhymes .</p>
    <p n="6">II</p>
    <p n="7">The gods talk in the breath of the woods , They talk in the shaken pine , And fill the long reach of the old seashore With dialogue divine ; And the poet who overhears Some random word they say Is the fated man of men Whom the ages must obey : One who having nectar drank Into blissful orgies sank ; He takes no mark of night or day , He cannot go , he cannot stay , He would , yet would not , counsel keep , But , like a walker in his sleep With staring eye that seeth none , Ridiculously up and down Seeks how he may fitly tell The heart-o'erlading miracle .</p>
    <p n="8">Not yet , not yet , Impatient friend ,— A little while attend ; Not yet I sing : but I must wait , My hand upon the silent string , Fully until the end . I see the coming light , I see the scattered gleams , Aloft , beneath , on left and right The stars ’ own ether beams ; These are but seeds of days , Not yet a steadfast morn , An intermittent blaze , An embryo god unborn .</p>
    <p n="9">How all things sparkle , The dust is alive , To the birth they arrive : I snuff the breath of my morning afar , I see the pale lustres condense to a star : The fading colors fix , The vanishing are seen , And the world that shall be Twins the world that has been . I know the appointed hour , I greet my office well , Never faster , never slower Revolves the fatal wheel ! The Fairest enchants me , The Mighty commands me , Saying , ‘ Stand in thy place ; Up and eastward turn thy face ; As mountains for the morning wait , Coming early , coming late , So thou attend the enriching Fate Which none can stay , and none accelerate . I am neither faint nor weary , Fill thy will , O faultless heart ! Here from youth to age I tarry ,— Count it flight of bird or dart . My heart at the heart of things Heeds no longer lapse of time , Rushing ages moult their wings , Bathing in thy day sublime .</p>
    <p n="10">The sun set , but set not his hope :— Stars rose , his faith was earlier up : Fixed on the enormous galaxy , Deeper and older seemed his eye , And matched his sufferance sublime The taciturnity of Time .</p>
    <p n="11">Beside his hut and shading oak , Thus to himself the poet spoke , ‘ I have supped to-night with gods , I will not go under a wooden roof : As I walked among the hills In the love which Nature fills , The great stars did not shine aloof , They hurried down from their deep abodes And hemmed me in their glittering troop .</p>
    <p n="12">‘ Divine Inviters ! I accept The courtesy ye have shown and kept From ancient ages for the bard , To modulate With finer fate A fortune harsh and hard . With aim like yours I watch your course , Who never break your lawful dance By error or intemperance . O birds of ether without wings ! O heavenly ships without a sail ! O fire of fire ! O best of things ! O mariners who never fail ! Sail swiftly through your amber vault , An animated law , a presence to exalt . ’</p>
    <p n="13">Ah , happy if a sun or star Could chain the wheel of Fortune 's car , And give to hold an even state , Neither dejected nor elate , That haply man upraised might keep The height of Fancy 's far-eyed steep . In vain : the stars are glowing wheels , Giddy with motion Nature reels , Sun , moon , man , undulate and stream , The mountains flow , the solids seem , Change acts , reacts ; back , forward hurled , And pause were palsy to the world .— The morn is come : the starry crowds Are hid behind the thrice-piled clouds ; The new day lowers , and equal odds Have changed not less the guest of gods ; Discrowned and timid , thoughtless , worn , The child of genius sits forlorn : Between two sleeps a short day 's stealth , ‘ Mid many ails a brittle health , A cripple of God , half true , half formed , And by great sparks Promethean warmed , Constrained by impotence to adjourn To infinite time his eager turn , His lot of action at the urn . He by false usage pinned about No breath therein , no passage out , Cast wishful glances at the stars And wishful saw the Ocean stream :— ‘ Merge me in the brute universe , Or lift to a diviner dream ! ’</p>
    <p n="14">Beside him sat enduring love , Upon him noble eyes did rest , Which , for the Genius that there strove . The follies bore that it invest . They spoke not , for their earnest sense Outran the craft of eloquence .</p>
    <p n="15">He whom God had thus preferred ,— To whom sweet angels ministered , Saluted him each morn as brother , And bragged his virtues to each other ,— Alas ! how were they so beguiled , And they so pure ? He , foolish child , A facile , reckless , wandering will , Eager for good , not hating ill , Thanked Nature for each stroke she dealt ; On his tense chords all strokes were felt , The good , the bad with equal zeal , He asked , he only asked , to feel . Timid , self-pleasing , sensitive , With Gods , with fools , content to live ; Bended to fops who bent to him ; Surface with surfaces did swim .</p>
    <p n="16">‘ Sorrow , sorrow ! ’ the angels cried , ‘ Is this dear Nature 's manly pride ? Call hither thy mortal enemy , Make him glad thy fall to see ! Yon waterflag , yon sighing osier , A drop can shake , a breath can fan ; Maidens laugh and weep ; Composure Is the pudency of man , ’</p>
    <p n="17">Again by night the poet went From the lighted halls Beneath the darkling firmament To the seashore , to the old seawalls , Out shone a star beneath the cloud , The constellation glittered soon ,— You have no lapse ; so have ye glowed But once in your dominion . And yet , dear stars , I know ye shine Only by needs and loves of mine ; Light-loving , light-asking life in me Feeds those eternal lamps I see . And I to whom your light has spoken , I , pining to be one of you , I fall , my faith is broken , Ye scorn me from your deeps of blue . Or if perchance , ye orbs of Fate , Your ne'er averted glance Beams with a will compassionate On sons of time and chance , Then clothe these hands with power In just proportion , Nor plant immense designs Where equal means are none . ’</p>
    <p n="18">CHORUS OF SPIRITS</p>
    <p n="19">Means , dear brother , ask them not ; Soul 's desire is means enow , Pure content is angel 's lot , Thine own theatre art thou .</p>
    <p n="20">Gentler far than falls the snow In the woodwalks still and low Fell the lesson on his heart And woke the fear lest angels part .</p>
    <p n="21">POET</p>
    <p n="22">I see your forms with deep content , I know that ye are excellent , But will ye stay ? I hear the rustle of wings , Ye meditate what to say Ere ye go to quit me for ever and aye .</p>
    <p n="23">SPIRITS</p>
    <p n="24">Brother , we are no phantom band ; Brother , accept this fatal hand . Aches thine unbelieving heart With the fear that we must part ? See , all we are rooted here By one thought to one same sphere ; From thyself thou canst not flee ,— From thyself no more can we .</p>
    <p n="25">POET</p>
    <p n="26">Suns and stars their courses keep , But not angels of the deep : Day and night their turn observe , But the day of day may swerve . Is there warrant that the waves Of thought in their mysterious caves Will heap in me their highest tide , In me therewith beatified ? Unsure the ebb and flood of thought , The moon comes back ,— the Spirit not .</p>
    <p n="27">SPIRITS</p>
    <p n="28">Brother , sweeter is the Law Than all the grace Love ever saw ; We are its suppliants . By it , we Draw the breath of Eternity ; Serve thou it not for daily bread ,— Serve it for pain and fear and need . Love it , though it hide its light ; By love behold the sun at night . If the Law should thee forget , More enamoured serve it yet ; Though it hate thee , suffer long ; Put the Spirit in the wrong ; Brother , no decrepitude Chills the limbs of Time ; As fleet his feet , his hands as good , His vision as sublime : On Nature 's wheels there is no rust ; Nor less on man 's enchanted dust Beauty and Force alight .</p>
    <p n="29">FRAGMENTS ON THE POET AND THE POETIC GIFT</p>
    <p n="30">I</p>
    <p n="31">There are beggars in Iran and Araby , SAID was hungrier than all ; Hafiz said he was a fly That came to every festival . He came a pilgrim to the Mosque On trail of camel and caravan , Knew every temple and kiosk Out from Mecca to Ispahan ; Northward he went to the snowy hills , At court he sat in the grave Divan . His music was the south-wind 's sigh , His lamp , the maiden 's downcast eye , And ever the spell of beauty came And turned the drowsy world to flame . By lake and stream and gleaming hall And modest copse and the forest tall , Where'er he went , the magic guide Kept its place by the poet 's side . Said melted the days like cups of pearl , Served high and low , the lord and the churl , Loved harebells nodding on a rock , A cabin hung with curling smoke , Ring of axe or hum of wheel Or gleam which use can paint on steel , And huts and tents ; nor loved he less Stately lords in palaces , Princely women hard to please , Fenced by form and ceremony , Decked by courtly rites and dress And etiquette of gentilesse . But when the mate of the snow and wind , He left each civil scale behind : Him wood-gods fed with honey wild And of his memory beguiled . He loved to watch and wake When the wing of the south-wind whipt the lake And the glassy surface in ripples brake And fled in pretty frowns away Like the flitting boreal lights , Rippling roses in northern nights , Or like the thrill of Aeolian strings In which the sudden wind-god rings . In caves and hollow trees he crept And near the wolf and panther slept . He came to the green ocean 's brim And saw the wheeling sea-birds skim , Summer and winter , o'er the wave , Like creatures of a skiey mould , Impassible to heat or cold . He stood before the tumbling main With joy too tense for sober brain ; He shared the life of the element , The tie of blood and home was rent : As if in him the welkin walked , The winds took flesh , the mountains talked , And he the bard , a crystal soul Sphered and concentric with the whole .</p>
    <p n="32">II</p>
    <p n="33">The Dervish whined to Said , “ Thou didst not tarry while I prayed . Beware the fire that Eblis burned , ” But Saadi coldly thus returned , “ Once with manlike love and fear I gave thee for an hour my ear , I kept the sun and stars at bay , And love , for words thy tongue could say . I cannot sell my heaven again For all that rattles in thy brain . ”</p>
    <p n="34">III</p>
    <p n="35">Said Saadi , “ When I stood before Hassan the camel-driver 's door , I scorned the fame of Timour brave ; Timour , to Hassan , was a slave . In every glance of Hassan 's eye I read great years of victory , And I , who cower mean and small In the frequent interval When wisdom not with me resides , Worship Toil 's wisdom that abides . I shunned his eyes , that faithful man 's , I shunned the toiling Hassan 's glance . ”</p>
    <p n="36">IV</p>
    <p n="37">The civil world will much forgive To bards who from its maxims live , But if , grown bold , the poet dare Bend his practice to his prayer And following his mighty heart Shame the times and live apart ,— Vae solis ! I found this , That of goods I could not miss If I fell within the line , Once a member , all was mine , Houses , banquets , gardens , fountains , Fortune 's delectable mountains ; But if I would walk alone , Was neither cloak nor crumb my own . And thus the high Muse treated me , Directly never greeted me , But when she spread her dearest spells , Feigned to speak to some one else . I was free to overhear , Or I might at will forbear ; Yet mark me well , that idle word Thus at random overheard Was the symphony of spheres , And proverb of a thousand years , The light wherewith all planets shone , The livery all events put on , It fell in rain , it grew in grain , It put on flesh in friendly form , Frowned in my foe and growled in storm , It spoke in Tullius Cicero , In Milton and in Angelo : I travelled and found it at Rome ; Eastward it filled all Heathendom And it lay on my hearth when I came home .</p>
    <p n="38">V</p>
    <p n="39">Mask thy wisdom with delight , Toy with the bow , yet hit the white , As Jelaleddin old and gray ; He seemed to bask , to dream and play Without remoter hope or fear Than still to entertain his ear And pass the burning summer-time In the palm-grove with a rhyme ; Heedless that each cunning word Tribes and ages overheard : Those idle catches told the laws Holding Nature to her cause .</p>
    <p n="40">God only knew how Saadi dined ; Roses he ate , and drank the wind ; He freelier breathed beside the pine , In cities he was low and mean ; The mountain waters washed him clean And by the sea-waves he was strong ; He heard their medicinal song , Asked no physician but the wave , No palace but his sea-beat cave .</p>
    <p n="41">Saadi held the Muse in awe , She was his mistress and his law ; A twelvemonth he could silence hold , Nor ran to speak till she him told ; He felt the flame , the fanning wings , Nor offered words till they were things , Glad when the solid mountain swims In music and uplifting hymns .</p>
    <p n="42">Charmed from fagot and from steel , Harvests grew upon his tongue , Past and future must reveal All their heart when Saadi sung ; Sun and moon must fall amain Like sower 's seeds into his brain , There quickened to be born again .</p>
    <p n="43">The free winds told him what they knew , Discoursed of fortune as they blew ; Omens and signs that filled the air To him authentic witness bare ; The birds brought auguries on their wings , And carolled undeceiving things Him to beckon , him to warn ; Well might then the poet scorn To learn of scribe or courier Things writ in vaster character ; And on his mind at dawn of day Soft shadows of the evening lay .</p>
    <p n="44">Pale genius roves alone , No scout can track his way , None credits him till he have shown His diamonds to the day .</p>
    <p n="45">Not his the feaster 's wine , Nor land , nor gold , nor power , By want and pain God screeneth him Till his elected hour .</p>
    <p n="46">Go , speed the stars of Thought On to their shining goals :— The sower scatters broad his seed , The wheat thou strew'st be souls .</p>
    <p n="47">I grieve that better souls than mine Docile read my measured line : High destined youths and holy maids Hallow these my orchard shades ; Environ me and me baptize With light that streams from gracious eyes . I dare not be beloved and known , I ungrateful , I alone .</p>
    <p n="48">Ever find me dim regards , Love of ladies , love of bards , Marked forbearance , compliments , Tokens of benevolence . What then , can I love myself ? Fame is profitless as pelf , A good in Nature not allowed They love me , as I love a cloud Sailing falsely in the sphere , Hated mist if it come near .</p>
    <p n="49">For thought , and not praise ; Thought is the wages For which I sell days , Will gladly sell ages And willing grow old Deaf , and dumb , and blind , and cold , Melting matter into dreams , Panoramas which I saw And whatever glows or seems Into substance , into Law .</p>
    <p n="50">For Fancy 's gift Can mountains lift ; The Muse can knit What is past , what is done , With the web that 's just begun ; Making free with time and size , Dwindles here , there magnifies , Swells a rain-drop to a tun ; So to repeat No word or feat Crowds in a day the sum of ages , And blushing Love outwits the sages .</p>
    <p n="51">Try the might the Muse affords And the balm of thoughtful words ; Bring music to the desolate ; Hang roses on the stony fate .</p>
    <p n="52">But over all his crowning grace , Wherefor thanks God his daily praise , Is the purging of his eye To see the people of the sky : From blue mount and headland dim Friendly hands stretch forth to him , Him they beckon , him advise Of heavenlier prosperities And a more excelling grace And a truer bosom-glow Than the wine-fed feasters know . They turn his heart from lovely maids , And make the darlings of the earth Swainish , coarse and nothing worth : Teach him gladly to postpone Pleasures to another stage Beyond the scope of human age , Freely as task at eve undone Waits unblamed to-morrow 's sun .</p>
    <p n="53">By thoughts I lead Bards to say what nations need ; What imports , what irks and what behooves , Framed afar as Fates and Loves .</p>
    <p n="54">And as the light divides the dark Through with living swords , So shall thou pierce the distant age With adamantine words .</p>
    <p n="55">I framed his tongue to music , I armed his hand with skill , I moulded his face to beauty And his heart the throne of Will .</p>
    <p n="56">For every God Obeys the hymn , obeys the ode .</p>
    <p n="57">For art , for music over-thrilled , The wine-cup shakes , the wine is spilled .</p>
    <p n="58">Hold of the Maker , not the Made ; Sit with the Cause , or grim or glad .</p>
    <p n="59">That book is good Which puts me in a working mood . Unless to Thought is added Will , Apollo is an imbecile . What parts , what gems , what colors shine ,— Ah , but I miss the grand design .</p>
    <p n="60">Like vaulters in a circus round Who leap from horse to horse , but never touch the ground .</p>
    <p n="61">For Genius made his cabin wide , And Love led Gods therein to bide .</p>
    <p n="62">The atom displaces all atoms beside , And Genius unspheres all souls that abide .</p>
    <p n="63">To transmute crime to wisdom , so to stem The vice of Japhet by the thought of Shem .</p>
    <p n="64">He could condense cerulean ether Into the very best sole-leather .</p>
    <p n="65">Forbore the ant-hill , shunned to tread , In mercy , on one little head .</p>
    <p n="66">I have no brothers and no peers , And the dearest interferes : When I would spend a lonely day , Sun and moon are in my way .</p>
    <p n="67">The brook sings on , but sings in vain Wanting the echo in my brain .</p>
    <p n="68">He planted where the deluge ploughed . His hired hands were wind and cloud ; His eyes detect the Gods concealed In the hummock of the field .</p>
    <p n="69">For what need I of book or priest , Or sibyl from the mummied East , When every star is Bethlehem star ? I count as many as there are Cinquefoils or violets in the grass , So many saints and saviors , So many high behaviors Salute the bard who is alive And only sees what he doth give .</p>
    <p n="70">Coin the day-dawn into lines In which its proper splendor shines ; Coin the moonlight into verse Which all its marvel shall rehearse , Chasing with words fast-flowing things ; nor try To plant thy shrivelled pedantry On the shoulders of the sky .</p>
    <p n="71">Ah , not to me those dreams belong ! A better voice peals through my song .</p>
    <p n="72">The Muse 's hill by Fear is guarded , A bolder foot is still rewarded .</p>
    <p n="73">His instant thought a poet spoke , And filled the age his fame ; An inch of ground the lightning strook But lit the sky with flame .</p>
    <p n="74">If bright the sun , he tarries , All day his song is heard ; And when he goes he carries No more baggage than a bird .</p>
    <p n="75">The Asmodean feat is mine , To spin my sand-heap into twine .</p>
    <p n="76">Slighted Minerva 's learnèd tongue , But leaped with joy when on the wind The shell of Clio rung .</p>
    <p n="77">FRAGMENTS ON NATURE AND LIFE</p>
    <p n="78">NATURE</p>
    <p n="79">The patient Pan , Drunken with nectar , Sleeps or feigns slumber , Drowsily humming Music to the march of time . This poor tooting , creaking cricket , Pan , half asleep , rolling over His great body in the grass , Tooting , creaking , Feigns to sleep , sleeping never ; ‘ T is his manner , Well he knows his own affair , Piling mountain chains of phlegm On the nervous brain of man , As he holds down central fires Under Alps and Andes cold ; Haply else we could not live , Life would be too wild an ode .</p>
    <p n="80">Come search the wood for flowers ,— Wild tea and wild pea , Grapevine and succory , Coreopsis And liatris , Flaunting in their bowers ; Grass with green flag half-mast high , Succory to match the sky , Columbine with horn of honey , Scented fern and agrimony ; Forest full of essences Fit for fairy presences , Peppermint and sassafras , Sweet fern , mint and vernal grass , Panax , black birch , sugar maple , Sweet and scent for Dian 's table , Elder-blow , sarsaparilla , Wild rose , lily , dry vanilla ,— Spices in the plants that run To bring their first fruits to the sun . Earliest heats that follow frore Nervèd leaf of hellebore , Sweet willow , checkerberry red , With its savory leaf for bread . Silver birch and black With the selfsame spice Found in polygala root and rind , Sassafras , fern , benzöine , Mouse-ear , cowslip , wintergreen , Which by aroma may compel The frost to spare , what scents so well .</p>
    <p n="81">Where the fungus broad and red Lifts its head , Like poisoned loaf of elfin bread , Where the aster grew With the social goldenrod , In a chapel , which the dew Made beautiful for God :— O what would Nature say ? She spared no speech to-day : The fungus and the bulrush spoke , Answered the pine-tree and the oak , The wizard South blew down the glen , Filled the straits and filled the wide , Each maple leaf turned up its silver side . All things shine in his smoky ray , And all we see are pictures high ; Many a high hillside , While oaks of pride Climb to their tops , And boys run out upon their leafy ropes . The maple street In the houseless wood , Voices followed after , Every shrub and grape leaf Rang with fairy laughter . I have heard them fall Like the strain of all King Oberon 's minstrelsy . Would hear the everlasting And know the only strong ? You must worship fasting , You must listen long . Words of the air Which birds of the air Carry aloft , below , around , To the isles of the deep , To the snow-capped steep , To the thundercloud .</p>
    <p n="82">For Nature , true and like in every place , Will hint her secret in a garden patch , Or in lone corners of a doleful heath , As in the Andes watched by fleets at sea , Or the sky-piercing horns of Himmaleh ; And , when I would recall the scenes I dreamed On Adirondac steeps , I know Small need have I of Turner or Daguerre , Assured to find the token once again In silver lakes that unexhausted gleam And peaceful woods beside my cottage door .</p>
    <p n="83">What all the books of ages paint , I have . What prayers and dreams of youthful genius feign , I daily dwell in , and am not so blind But I can see the elastic tent of day Belike has wider hospitality Than my few needs exhaust , and bids me read The quaint devices on its mornings gay . Yet Nature will not be in full possessed , And they who truliest love her , heralds are And harbingers of a majestic race , Who , having more absorbed , more largely yield , And walk on earth as the sun walks in the sphere .</p>
    <p n="84">But never yet the man was found Who could the mystery expound , Though Adam , born when oaks were young , Endured , the Bible says , as long ; But when at last the patriarch died The Gordian noose was still untied . He left , though goodly centuries old , Meek Nature 's secret still untold .</p>
    <p n="85">Atom from atom yawns as far As moon from earth , or star from star .</p>
    <p n="86">When all their blooms the meadows flaunt To deck the morning of the year , Why tinge thy lustres jubilant With forecast or with fear ?</p>
    <p n="87">Teach me your mood , O patient stars ! Who climb each night the ancient sky , Leaving on space no shade , no scars , No trace of age , no fear to die .</p>
    <p n="88">The sun athwart the cloud thought it no sin To use my land to put his rainbows in .</p>
    <p n="89">For joy and beauty planted it , With faerie gardens cheered , And boding Fancy haunted it With men and women weird .</p>
    <p n="90">What central flowing forces , say , Make up thy splendor , matchless day ?</p>
    <p n="91">Day by day for her darlings to her much she added more ; In her hundred-gated Thebes every chamber was a door , A door to something grander ,— loftier walls , and vaster floor .</p>
    <p n="92">She paints with white and red the moors To draw the nations out of doors .</p>
    <p n="93">A score of airy miles will smooth Rough Monadnoc to a gem .</p>
    <p n="94">THE EARTH</p>
    <p n="95">Our eyeless bark sails free Though with boom and spar Andes , Alp or Himmalee , Strikes never moon or star .</p>
    <p n="96">THE HEAVENS</p>
    <p n="97">Wisp and meteor nightly falling , But the Stars of God remain .</p>
    <p n="98">TRANSITION</p>
    <p n="99">See yonder leafless trees against the sky , How they diffuse themselves into the air , And , ever subdividing , separate Limbs into branches , branches into twigs . As if they loved the element , and hasted To dissipate their being into it .</p>
    <p n="100">Parks and ponds are good by day ; I do not delight In black acres of the night , Nor my unseasoned step disturbs The sleeps of trees or dreams of herbs .</p>
    <p n="101">In Walden wood the chickadee Runs round the pine and maple tree Intent on insect slaughter : O tufted entomologist ! Devour as many as you list , Then drink in Walden water .</p>
    <p n="102">The low December vault in June be lifted high , And largest clouds be flakes of down in that enormous sky .</p>
    <p n="103">THE GARDEN</p>
    <p n="104">Many things the garden shows , And pleased I stray From tree to tree Watching the white pear-bloom , Bee-infested quince or plum . I could walk days , years , away Till the slow ripening , secular tree Had reached its fruiting-time , Nor think it long .</p>
    <p n="105">Solar insect on the wing In the garden murmuring , Soothing with thy summer horn Swains by winter pinched and worn .</p>
    <p n="106">BIRDS</p>
    <p n="107">Darlings of children and of bard , Perfect kinds by vice unmarred , All of worth and beauty set Gems in Nature 's cabinet ; These the fables she esteems Reality most like to dreams . Welcome back , you little nations , Far-travelled in the south plantations ; Bring your music and rhythmic flight , Your colors for our eyes ’ delight : Freely nestle in our roof , Weave your chamber weatherproof ; And your enchanting manners bring And your autumnal gathering . Exchange in conclave general Greetings kind to each and all , Conscious each of duty done And unstainèd as the sun .</p>
    <p n="108">WATER</p>
    <p n="109">The water understands Civilization well ; It wets my foot , but prettily It chills my life , but wittily , It is not disconcerted , It is not broken-hearted : Well used , it decketh joy , Adorneth , doubleth joy : Ill used , it will destroy , In perfect time and measure With a face of golden pleasure Elegantly destroy .</p>
    <p n="110">NAHANT</p>
    <p n="111">All day the waves assailed the rock , I heard no church-bell chime , The sea-beat scorns the minster clock And breaks the glass of Time .</p>
    <p n="112">SUNRISE</p>
    <p n="113">Would you know what joy is hid In our green Musketaquid , And for travelled eyes what charms Draw us to these meadow farms , Come and I will show you all Makes each day a festival . Stand upon this pasture hill , Face the eastern star until The slow eye of heaven shall show The world above , the world below .</p>
    <p n="114">Behold the miracle ! Thou saw'st but now the twilight sad And stood beneath the firmament , A watchman in a dark gray tent , Waiting till God create the earth ,— Behold the new majestic birth ! The mottled clouds , like scraps of wool , Steeped in the light are beautiful . What majestic stillness broods Over these colored solitudes . Sleeps the vast East in pleasèd peace , Up the far mountain walls the streams increase Inundating the heaven With spouting streams and waves of light Which round the floating isles unite :— See the world below Baptized with the pure element , A clear and glorious firmament Touched with life by every beam . I share the good with every flower , I drink the nectar of the hour :— This is not the ancient earth Whereof old chronicles relate The tragic tales of crime and fate ; But rather , like its beads of dew And dew-bent violets , fresh and new , An exhalation of the time .</p>
    <p n="115">NIGHT IN JUNE</p>
    <p n="116">I left my dreary page and sallied forth , Received the fair inscriptions of the night ; The moon was making amber of the world , Glittered with silver every cottage pane , The trees were rich , yet ominous with gloom . The meadows broad From ferns and grapes and from the folded flowers Sent a nocturnal fragrance ; harlot flies Flashed their small fires in air , or held their court In fairy groves of herds-grass .</p>
    <p n="117">He lives not who can refuse me ; All my force saith , Come and use me : A gleam of sun , a summer rain , And all the zone is green again .</p>
    <p n="118">Seems , though the soft sheen all enchants , Cheers the rough crag and mournful dell , As if on such stern forms and haunts A wintry storm more fitly fell .</p>
    <p n="119">Put in , drive home the sightless wedges And split to flakes the crystal ledges .</p>
    <p n="120">MAIA</p>
    <p n="121">Illusion works impenetrable , Weaving webs innumerable , Her gay pictures never fail , Crowds each on other , veil on veil , Charmer who will be believed By man who thirsts to be deceived .</p>
    <p n="122">Illusions like the tints of pearl , Or changing colors of the sky , Or ribbons of a dancing girl That mend her beauty to the eye .</p>
    <p n="123">The cold gray down upon the quinces lieth And the poor spinners weave their webs thereon To share the sunshine that so spicy is .</p>
    <p n="124">Samson stark , at Dagon 's knee , Gropes for columns strong as he ; When his ringlets grew and curled , Groped for axle of the world .</p>
    <p n="125">But Nature whistled with all her winds , Did as she pleased and went her way .</p>
    <p n="126">LIFE</p>
    <p n="127">A train of gay and clouded days Dappled with joy and grief and praise , Beauty to fire us , saints to save , Escort us to a little grave .</p>
    <p n="128">No fate , save by the victim 's fault , is low , For God hath writ all dooms magnificent , So guilt not traverses his tender will .</p>
    <p n="129">Around the man who seeks a noble end , Not angels but divinities attend .</p>
    <p n="130">From high to higher forces The scale of power uprears , The heroes on their horses , The gods upon their spheres .</p>
    <p n="131">This shining moment is an edifice Which the Omnipotent cannot rebuild .</p>
    <p n="132">Roomy Eternity Casts her schemes rarely , And an aeon allows For each quality and part Of the multitudinous And many-chambered heart .</p>
    <p n="133">The beggar begs by God 's command , And gifts awake when givers sleep , Swords cannot cut the giving hand Nor stab the love that orphans keep .</p>
    <p n="134">In the chamber , on the stairs , Lurking dumb , Go and come Lemurs and Lars .</p>
    <p n="135">Such another peerless queen Only could her mirror show .</p>
    <p n="136">Easy to match what others do , Perform the feat as well as they ; Hard to out-do the brave , the true , And find a loftier way : The school decays , the learning spoils Because of the sons of wine ; How snatch the stripling from their toils ?— Yet can one ray of truth divine The blaze of revellers ’ feasts outshine .</p>
    <p n="137">Of all wit 's uses the main one Is to live well with who has none .</p>
    <p n="138">The tongue is prone to lose the way , Not so the pen , for in a letter We have not better things to say , But surely say them better .</p>
    <p n="139">She walked in flowers around my field As June herself around the sphere .</p>
    <p n="140">Friends to me are frozen wine ; I wait the sun on them should shine .</p>
    <p n="141">You shall not love me for what daily spends ; You shall not know me in the noisy street , Where I , as others , follow petty ends ; Nor when in fair saloons we chance to meet ; Nor when I 'm jaded , sick , anxious or mean . But love me then and only , when you know Me for the channel of the rivers of God From deep ideal fontal heavens that flow .</p>
    <p n="142">To and fro the Genius flies , A light which plays and hovers Over the maiden 's head And dips sometimes as low as to her eyes . Of her faults I take no note , Fault and folly are not mine ; Comes the Genius ,— all 's forgot , Replunged again into that upper sphere He scatters wide and wild its lustres here .</p>
    <p n="143">Love Asks nought his brother cannot give ; Asks nothing , but does all receive . Love calls not to his aid events ; He to his wants can well suffice : Asks not of others soft consents , Nor kind occasion without eyes ; Nor plots to ope or bolt a gate , Nor heeds Condition 's iron walls ,— Where he goes , goes before him Fate ; Whom he uniteth , God installs ; Instant and perfect his access To the dear object of his thought , Though foes and land and seas between Himself and his love intervene .</p>
    <p n="144">The brave Empedocles , defying fools , Pronounced the word that mortals hate to hear — “ I am divine , I am not mortal made ; I am superior to my human weeds . ” Not Sense but Reason is the Judge of truth ; Reason 's twofold , part human , part divine ; That human part may be described and taught , The other portion language cannot speak .</p>
    <p n="145">Tell men what they knew before ; Paint the prospect from their door .</p>
    <p n="146">Him strong Genius urged to roam , Stronger Custom brought him home .</p>
    <p n="147">That each should in his house abide . Therefore was the world so wide .</p>
    <p n="148">Thou shalt make thy house The temple of a nation 's vows . Spirits of a higher strain Who sought thee once shall seek again . I detected many a god Forth already on the road , Ancestors of beauty come In thy breast to make a home .</p>
    <p n="149">The archangel Hope Looks to the azure cope , Waits through dark ages for the morn , Defeated day by day , but unto victory born .</p>
    <p n="150">As the drop feeds its fated flower , As finds its Alp the snowy shower , Child of the omnific Need , Hurled into life to do a deed , Man drinks the water , drinks the light .</p>
    <p n="151">Ever the Rock of Ages melts Into the mineral air , To be the quarry whence to build Thought and its mansions fair .</p>
    <p n="152">Go if thou wilt , ambrosial flower , Go match thee with thy seeming peers ; I will wait Heaven 's perfect hour Through the innumerable years .</p>
    <p n="153">Yes , sometimes to the sorrow-stricken Shall his own sorrow seem impertinent , A thing that takes no more root in the world Than doth the traveller 's shadow on the rock .</p>
    <p n="154">But if thou do thy best , Without remission , without rest , And invite the sunbeam , And abhor to feign or seem Even to those who thee should love And thy behavior approve ; If thou go in thine own likeness , Be it health , or be it sickness ; If thou go as thy father 's son , If thou wear no mask or lie , Dealing purely and nakedly ,—</p>
    <p n="155">Ascending thorough just degrees To a consummate holiness , As angel blind to trespass done , And bleaching all souls like the sun .</p>
    <p n="156">From the stores of eldest matter , The deep-eyed flame , obedient water , Transparent air , all-feeding earth , He took the flower of all their worth , And , best with best in sweet consent , Combined a new temperament .</p>
    <p n="157">REX</p>
    <p n="158">The bard and mystic held me for their own , I filled the dream of sad , poetic maids , I took the friendly noble by the hand , I was the trustee of the hand-cart man , The brother of the fisher , porter , swain , And these from the crowd 's edge well pleased beheld The service done to me as done to them .</p>
    <p n="159">With the key of the secret he marches faster , From strength to strength , and for night brings day ; While classes or tribes , too weak to master The flowing conditions of life , give way .</p>
    <p n="160">SUUM CUIQUE</p>
    <p n="161">Wilt thou seal up the avenues of ill ? Pay every debt as if God wrote the bill .</p>
    <p n="162">If curses be the wage of love , Hide in thy skies , thou fruitless Jove , Not to be named : It is clear Why the gods will not appear ; They are ashamed .</p>
    <p n="163">When wrath and terror changed Jove 's regal port , And the rash-leaping thunderbolt fell short .</p>
    <p n="164">Shun passion , fold the hands of thrift , Sit still and Truth is near : Suddenly it will uplift Your eyelids to the sphere : Wait a little , you shall see The portraiture of things to be .</p>
    <p n="165">The rules to men made evident By Him who built the day , The columns of the firmament Not firmer based than they .</p>
    <p n="166">On bravely through the sunshine and the showers ! Time hath his work to do and we have ours .</p>
    <p n="167">THE BOHEMIAN HYMN</p>
    <p n="168">In many forms we try To utter God 's infinity , But the boundless hath no form , And the Universal Friend Doth as far transcend An angel as a worm .</p>
    <p n="169">The great Idea baffles wit , Language falters under it , It leaves the learned in the lurch ; Nor art , nor power , nor toil can find The measure of the eternal Mind , Nor hymn , nor prayer , nor church .</p>
    <p n="170">GRACE</p>
    <p n="171">How much , preventing God , how much I owe To the defences thou hast round me set ; Example , custom , fear , occasion slow ,— These scorned bondmen were my parapet . I dare not peep over this parapet To gauge with glance the roaring gulf below , The depths of sin to which I had descended , Had not these me against myself defended .</p>
    <p n="172">INSIGHT</p>
    <p n="173">Power that by obedience grows , Knowledge which its source not knows , Wave which severs whom it bears From the things which he compares , Adding wings through things to range , To his own blood harsh and strange .</p>
    <p n="174">PAN</p>
    <p n="175">O what are heroes , prophets , men , But pipes through which the breath of Pan doth blow A momentary music . Being 's tide Swells hitherward , and myriads of forms Live , robed with beauty , painted by the sun ; Their dust , pervaded by the nerves of God , Throbs with an overmastering energy Knowing and doing . Ebbs the tide , they lie White hollow shells upon the desert shore , But not the less the eternal wave rolls on To animate new millions , and exhale Races and planets , its enchanted foam .</p>
    <p n="176">MONADNOC FROM AFAR</p>
    <p n="177">Dark flower of Cheshire garden , Red evening duly dyes Thy sombre head with rosy hues To fix far-gazing eyes . Well the Planter knew how strongly Works thy form on human thought ; I muse what secret purpose had he To draw all fancies to this spot .</p>
    <p n="178">SEPTEMBER</p>
    <p n="179">In the turbulent beauty Of a gusty Autumn day , Poet on a sunny headland Sighed his soul away .</p>
    <p n="180">Farms the sunny landscape dappled , Swandown clouds dappled the farms , Cattle lowed in mellow distance Where far oaks outstretched their arms .</p>
    <p n="181">Sudden gusts came full of meaning , All too much to him they said , Oh , south winds have long memories , Of that be none afraid .</p>
    <p n="182">I cannot tell rude listeners Half the tell-tale South-wind said ,— ‘ T would bring the blushes of yon maples To a man and to a maid .</p>
    <p n="183">EROS</p>
    <p n="184">They put their finger on their lip , The Powers above : The seas their islands clip , The moons in ocean dip , They love , but name not love .</p>
    <p n="185">OCTOBER</p>
    <p n="186">October woods wherein The boy 's dream comes to pass , And Nature squanders on the boy her pomp , And crowns him with a more than royal crown , And unimagined splendor waits his steps . The gazing urchin walks through tents of gold , Through crimson chambers , porphyry and pearl , Pavilion on pavilion , garlanded , Incensed and starred with lights and airs and shapes , Color and sound , music to eye and ear , Beyond the best conceit of pomp or power .</p>
    <p n="187">PETER 'S FIELD</p>
    <p n="188">[ Knows he who tills this lonely field To reap its scanty corn , What mystic fruit his acres yield At midnight and at morn ? ]</p>
    <p n="189">That field by spirits bad and good , By Hell and Heaven is haunted , And every rood in the hemlock wood I know is ground enchanted .</p>
    <p n="190">[ In the long sunny afternoon The plain was full of ghosts : I wandered up , I wandered down , Beset by pensive hosts . ]</p>
    <p n="191">For in those lonely grounds the sun Shines not as on the town , In nearer arcs his journeys run , And nearer stoops the moon .</p>
    <p n="192">There in a moment I have seen The buried Past arise ; The fields of Thessaly grew green , Old gods forsook the skies .</p>
    <p n="193">I cannot publish in my rhyme What pranks the greenwood played ; It was the Carnival of time , And Ages went or stayed .</p>
    <p n="194">To me that spectral nook appeared The mustering Day of Doom , And round me swarmed in shadowy troop Things past and things to come .</p>
    <p n="195">The darkness haunteth me elsewhere ; There I am full of light ; In every whispering leaf I hear More sense than sages write .</p>
    <p n="196">Underwoods were full of pleasance , All to each in kindness bend , And every flower made obeisance As a man unto his friend .</p>
    <p n="197">Far seen , the river glides below , Tossing one sparkle to the eyes : I catch thy meaning , wizard wave ; The River of my Life replies .</p>
    <p n="198">MUSIC</p>
    <p n="199">Let me go where'er I will , I hear a sky-born music still : It sounds from all things old , It sounds from all things young , From all that 's fair , from all that 's foul , Peals out a cheerful song .</p>
    <p n="200">It is not only in the rose , It is not only in the bird , Not only where the rainbow glows , Nor in the song of woman heard , But in the darkest , meanest things There alway , alway something sings .</p>
    <p n="201">‘ T is not in the high stars alone , Nor in the cup of budding flowers , Nor in the redbreast 's mellow tone , Nor in the bow that smiles in showers , But in the mud and scum of things There alway , alway something sings .</p>
    <p n="202">THE WALK</p>
    <p n="203">A Queen rejoices in her peers , And wary Nature knows her own By court and city , dale and down , And like a lover volunteers , And to her son will treasures more And more to purpose freely pour In one wood walk , than learned men Can find with glass in ten times ten .</p>
    <p n="204">COSMOS</p>
    <p n="205">Who saw the hid beginnings When Chaos and Order strove , Or who can date the morning . The purple flaming of love ?</p>
    <p n="206">I saw the hid beginnings When Chaos and Order strove , And I can date the morning prime And purple flame of love .</p>
    <p n="207">Song breathed from all the forest , The total air was fame ; It seemed the world was all torches That suddenly caught the flame .</p>
    <p n="208">Is there never a retroscope mirror In the realms and corners of space That can give us a glimpse of the battle And the soldiers face to face ?</p>
    <p n="209">Sit here on the basalt courses Where twisted hills betray The seat of the world-old Forces Who wrestled here on a day .</p>
    <p n="210">When the purple flame shoots up , And Love ascends his throne , I cannot hear your songs , O birds , For the witchery of my own .</p>
    <p n="211">And every human heart Still keeps that golden day And rings the bells of jubilee On its own First of May .</p>
    <p n="212">THE MIRACLE</p>
    <p n="213">I have trod this path a hundred times With idle footsteps , crooning rhymes . I know each nest and web-worm 's tent , The fox-hole which the woodchucks rent , Maple and oak , the old Divan Self-planted twice , like the banian . I know not why I came again Unless to learn it ten times ten . To read the sense the woods impart You must bring the throbbing heart . Love is aye the counterforce ,— Terror and Hope and wild Remorse , Newest knowledge , fiery thought , Or Duty to grand purpose wrought . Wandering yester morn the brake , I reached this heath beside the lake , And oh , the wonder of the power , The deeper secret of the hour ! Nature , the supplement of man , His hidden sense interpret can ;— What friend to friend cannot convey Shall the dumb bird instructed say . Passing yonder oak , I heard Sharp accents of my woodland bird ; I watched the singer with delight ,— But mark what changed my joy to fright ,— When that bird sang , I gave the theme ; That wood-bird sang my last night 's dream , A brown wren was the Daniel That pierced my trance its drift to tell , Knew my quarrel , how and why , Published it to lake and sky , Told every word and syllable In his flippant chirping babble , All my wrath and all my shames , Nay , God is witness , gave the names .</p>
    <p n="214">THE WATERFALL</p>
    <p n="215">A patch of meadow upland Reached by a mile of road , Soothed by the voice of waters , With birds and flowers bestowed .</p>
    <p n="216">Hither I come for strength Which well it can supply , For Love draws might from terrene force And potencies of sky .</p>
    <p n="217">The tremulous battery Earth Responds to the touch of man ; It thrills to the antipodes , From Boston to Japan .</p>
    <p n="218">The planets ’ child the planet knows And to his joy replies ; To the lark 's trill unfolds the rose , Clouds flush their gayest dyes .</p>
    <p n="219">When Ali prayed and loved Where Syrian waters roll , Upward the ninth heaven thrilled and moved ; At the tread of the jubilant soul .</p>
    <p n="220">WALDEN</p>
    <p n="221">In my garden three ways meet , Thrice the spot is blest ; Hermit-thrush comes there to build , Carrier-doves to nest .</p>
    <p n="222">There broad-armed oaks , the copses ’ maze , The cold sea-wind detain ; Here sultry Summer overstays When Autumn chills the plain .</p>
    <p n="223">Self-sown my stately garden grows ; The winds and wind-blown seed , Cold April rain and colder snows My hedges plant and feed .</p>
    <p n="224">From mountains far and valleys near The harvests sown to-day Thrive in all weathers without fear ,— Wild planters , plant away !</p>
    <p n="225">In cities high the careful crowds Of woe-worn mortals darkling go , But in these sunny solitudes My quiet roses blow .</p>
    <p n="226">Methought the sky looked scornful down On all was base in man , And airy tongues did taunt the town , ‘ Achieve our peace who can ! ’</p>
    <p n="227">What need I holier dew Than Walden 's haunted wave , Distilled from heaven 's alembic blue , Steeped in each forest cave ?</p>
    <p n="228">[ If Thought unlock her mysteries , If Friendship on me smile , I walk in marble galleries , I talk with kings the while . ]</p>
    <p n="229">How drearily in College hall The Doctor stretched the hours , But in each pause we heard the call Of robins out of doors .</p>
    <p n="230">The air is wise , the wind thinks well , And all through which it blows , If plants or brain , if egg or shell , Or bird or biped knows ;</p>
    <p n="231">And oft at home ‘ mid tasks I heed , I heed how wears the day ; We must not halt while fiercely speed The spans of life away .</p>
    <p n="232">What boots it here of Thebes or Rome Or lands of Eastern day ? In forests I am still at home And there I cannot stray .</p>
    <p n="233">THE ENCHANTER</p>
    <p n="234">In the deep heart of man a poet dwells Who all the day of life his summer story tells ; Scatters on every eye dust of his spells , Scent , form and color ; to the flowers and shells Wins the believing child with wondrous tales ; Touches a cheek with colors of romance , And crowds a history into a glance ; Gives beauty to the lake and fountain , Spies oversea the fires of the mountain ; When thrushes ope their throat , ‘ t is he that sings , And he that paints the oriole 's fiery wings . The little Shakspeare in the maiden 's heart Makes Romeo of a plough-boy on his cart ; Opens the eye to Virtue 's starlike meed And gives persuasion to a gentle deed .</p>
    <p n="235">WRITTEN IN A VOLUME OF GOETHE</p>
    <p n="236">Six thankful weeks ,— and let it be A meter of prosperity ,— In my coat I bore this book , And seldom therein could I look , For I had too much to think , Heaven and earth to eat and drink . Is he hapless who can spare In his plenty things so rare ?</p>
    <p n="237">RICHES</p>
    <p n="238">Have ye seen the caterpillar Foully warking in his nest ? ‘ T is the poor man getting siller , Without cleanness , without rest .</p>
    <p n="239">Have ye seen the butterfly In braw claithing drest ? ‘ T is the poor man gotten rich , In rings and painted vest .</p>
    <p n="240">The poor man crawls in web of rags And sore bested with woes . But when he flees on riches ’ wings , He laugheth at his foes .</p>
    <p n="241">PHILOSOPHER</p>
    <p n="242">Philosophers are lined with eyes within , And , being so , the sage unmakes the man . In love , he cannot therefore cease his trade ; Scarce the first blush has overspread his cheek , He feels it , introverts his learned eye To catch the unconscious heart in the very act .</p>
    <p n="243">His mother died ,— the only friend he had ,— Some tears escaped , but his philosophy Couched like a cat sat watching close behind And throttled all his passion . Is't not like That devil-spider that devours her mate Scarce freed from her embraces ?</p>
    <p n="244">INTELLECT</p>
    <p n="245">Gravely it broods apart on joy , And , truth to tell , amused by pain .</p>
    <p n="246">LIMITS</p>
    <p n="247">Who knows this or that ? Hark in the wall to the rat : Since the world was , he has gnawed ; Of his wisdom , of his fraud What dost thou know ? In the wretched little beast Is life and heart , Child and parent , Not without relation To fruitful field and sun and moon . What art thou ? His wicked eye Is cruel to thy cruelty .</p>

    <p>INSCRIPTION FOR A WELL IN MEMORY OF THE MARTYRS OF THE WAR Fall , stream , from Heaven to bless ; return as well ; So did our sons ; Heaven met them as they fell . THE EXILE ( AFTER TALIESSIN ) The heavy blue chain Of the boundless main Didst thou , just man , endure . I have an arrow that will find its mark , A mastiff that will bite without a hark . VI POEMS OF YOUTH AND EARLY MANHOOD 1823-1834 THE BELL I love thy music , mellow bell , I love thine iron chime , To life or death , to heaven or hell , Which calls the sons of Time . Thy voice upon the deep The home-bound sea-boy hails , It charms his cares to sleep , It cheers him as he sails . To house of God and heavenly joys Thy summons called our sires , And good men thought thy sacred voice Disarmed the thunder 's fires . And soon thy music , sad death-bell , Shall lift its notes once more , And mix my requiem with the wind That sweeps my native shore . 1823 . THOUGHT I am not poor , but I am proud , Of one inalienable right , Above the envy of the crowd ,— Thought 's holy light . Better it is than gems or gold , And oh ! it cannot die , But thought will glow when the sun grows cold , And mix with Deity . BOSTON , 1823 . PRAYER When success exalts thy lot , God for thy virtue lays a plot : And all thy life is for thy own , Then for mankind 's instruction shown ; And though thy knees were never bent , To Heaven thy hourly prayers are sent , And whether formed for good or ill , Are registered and answered still . 1826 [? ] . I bear in youth the sad infirmities That use to undo the limb and sense of age ; It hath pleased Heaven to break the dream of bliss Which lit my onward way with bright presage , And my unserviceable limbs forego . The sweet delight I found in fields and farms , On windy hills , whose tops with morning glow , And lakes , smooth mirrors of Aurora 's charms . Yet I think on them in the silent night , Still breaks that morn , though dim , to Memory 's eye , And the firm soul does the pale train defy Of grim Disease , that would her peace affright . Please God , I 'll wrap me in mine innocence , And bid each awful Muse drive the damned harpies hence . CAMBRIDGE , 1827 . Be of good cheer , brave spirit ; steadfastly Serve that low whisper thou hast served ; for know , God hath a select family of sons Now scattered wide thro ’ earth , and each alone , Who are thy spiritual kindred , and each one By constant service to , that inward law , Is weaving the sublime proportions Of a true monarch 's soul . Beauty and strength , The riches of a spotless memory , The eloquence of truth , the wisdom got By searching of a clear and loving eye That seeth as God seeth . These are their gifts , And Time , who keeps God 's word , brings on the day To seal the marriage of these minds with thine , Thine everlasting lovers . Ye shall be The salt of all the elements , world of the world . TO-DAY I rake no coffined clay , nor publish wide The resurrection of departed pride . Safe in their ancient crannies , dark and deep , Let kings and conquerors , saints and soldiers sleep — Late in the world ,— too late perchance for fame , Just late enough to reap abundant blame ,— I choose a novel theme , a bold abuse Of critic charters , an unlaurelled Muse . Old mouldy men and books and names and lands Disgust my reason and defile my hands . I had as lief respect an ancient shoe , As love old things for age , and hate the new . I spurn the Past , my mind disdains its nod , Nor kneels in homage to so mean a God . I laugh at those who , while they gape and gaze , The bald antiquity of China praise . Youth is ( whatever cynic tubs pretend ) The fault that boys and nations soonest mend . 1824 . FAME Ah Fate , cannot a man Be wise without a beard ? East , West , from Beer to Dan , Say , was it never heard That wisdom might in youth be gotten , Or wit be ripe before ‘ t was rotten ? He pays too high a price For knowledge and for fame Who sells his sinews to be wise , His teeth and bones to buy a name , And crawls through life a paralytic To earn the praise of bard and critic . Were it not better done , To dine and sleep through forty years ; Be loved by few ; be feared by none ; Laugh life away ; have wine for tears ; And take the mortal leap undaunted , Content that all we asked was granted ? But Fate will not permit The seed of gods to die , Nor suffer sense to win from wit Its guerdon in the sky , Nor let us hide , whate'er our pleasure , The world 's light underneath a measure . Go then , sad youth , and shine ; Go , sacrifice to Fame ; Put youth , joy , health upon the shrine , And life to fan the flame ; Being for Seeming bravely barter And die to Fame a happy martyr . 1824 . THE SUMMONS A sterner errand to the silken troop Has quenched the uneasy blush that warmed my cheek ; I am commissioned in my day of joy To leave my woods and streams and the sweet sloth Of prayer and song that were my dear delight , To leave the rudeness of my woodland life , Sweet twilight walks and midnight solitude And kind acquaintance with the morning stars And the glad hey-day of my household hours , The innocent mirth which sweetens daily bread , Railing in love to those who rail again , By mind 's industry sharpening the love of life — Books , Muses , Study , fireside , friends and love , I loved ye with true love , so fare ye well ! I was a boy ; boyhood slid gayly by And the impatient years that trod on it Taught me new lessons in the lore of life . I 've learned the sum of that sad history All woman-born do know , that hoped-for days , Days that come dancing on fraught with delights , Dash our blown hopes as they limp heavily by . But I , the bantling of a country Muse , Abandon all those toys with speed to obey The King whose meek ambassador I go . 1826 . THE RIVER And I behold once more My old familiar haunts ; here the blue river , The same blue wonder that my infant eye Admired , sage doubting whence the traveller came ,— Whence brought his sunny bubbles ere he washed The fragrant flag-roots in my father 's fields , And where thereafter in the world he went . Look , here he is , unaltered , save that now He hath broke his banks and flooded all the vales With his redundant waves . Here is the rock where , yet a simple child , I caught with bended pin my earliest fish , Much triumphing ,— and these the fields Over whose flowers I chased the butterfly A blooming hunter of a fairy fine . And hark ! where overhead the ancient crows Hold their sour conversation in the sky :— These are the same , but I am not the same , But wiser than I was , and wise enough Not to regret the changes , tho ’ they cost Me many a sigh . Oh , call not Nature dumb ; These trees and stones are audible to me , These idle flowers , that tremble in the wind , I understand their faery syllables , And all their sad significance . The wind , That rustles down the well-known forest road — It hath a sound more eloquent than speech . The stream , the trees , the grass , the sighing wind , All of them utter sounds of ‘ monishment And grave parental love . They are not of our race , they seem to say , And yet have knowledge of our moral race , And somewhat of majestic sympathy , Something of pity for the puny clay , That holds and boasts the immeasurable mind . I feel as I were welcome to these trees After long months of weary wandering , Acknowledged by their hospitable boughs ; They know me as their son , for side by side , They were coeval with my ancestors , Adorned with them my country 's primitive times , And soon may give my dust their funeral shade . CONCORD , June , 1827 . GOOD HOPE The cup of life is not so shallow That we have drained the best , That all the wine at once we swallow And lees make all the rest . Maids of as soft a bloom shall marry As Hymen yet hath blessed , And fairer forms are in the quarry Than Phidias released . 1827 . LINES TO ELLEN Tell me , maiden , dost thou use Thyself thro ’ Nature to diffuse ? All the angles of the coast Were tenanted by thy sweet ghost , Bore thy colors every flower , Thine each leaf and berry bore ; All wore thy badges and thy favors In their scent or in their savors , Every moth with painted wing , Every bird in carolling , The wood-boughs with thy manners waved , The rocks uphold thy name engraved , The sod throbbed friendly to my feet , And the sweet air with thee was sweet . The saffron cloud that floated warm Studied thy motion , took thy form , And in his airy road benign Recalled thy skill in bold design , Or seemed to use his privilege To gaze o'er the horizon 's edge , To search where now thy beauty glowed , Or made what other purlieus proud . 1829 . SECURITY Though her eye seek other forms And a glad delight below , Yet the love the world that warms Bids for me her bosom glow . She must love me till she find Another heart as large and true . Her soul is frank as the ocean wind , And the world has only two . If Nature hold another heart That knows a purer flame than me , I too therein could challenge part And learn of love a new degree . 1829 . A dull uncertain brain , But gifted yet to know That God has cherubim who go Singing an immortal strain , Immortal here below . I know the mighty bards , I listen when they sing , And now I know The secret store Which these explore When they with torch of genius pierce The tenfold clouds that cover The riches of the universe From God 's adoring lover . And if to me it is not given To fetch one ingot thence Of the unfading gold of Heaven His merchants may dispense , Yet well I know the royal mine , And know the sparkle of its ore , Know Heaven 's truth from lies that shine — Explored they teach us to explore . 1831 . A MOUNTAIN GRAVE Why fear to die And let thy body lie Under the flowers of June , Thy body food For the ground-worms ’ brood And thy grave smiled on by the visiting moon . Amid great Nature 's halls Girt in by mountain walls And washed with waterfalls It would please me to die , Where every wind that swept my tomb Goes loaded with a free perfume Dealt out with a God 's charity . I should like to die in sweets , A hill 's leaves for winding-sheets , And the searching sun to see That I am laid with decency . And the commissioned wind to sing His mighty psalm from fall to spring And annual tunes commemorate Of Nature 's child the common fate . WILLIAMSTOWN , VERMONT , 1 June , 1831 . A LETTER Dear brother , would you know the life , Please God , that I would lead ? On the first wheels that quit this weary town Over yon western bridges I would ride And with a cheerful benison forsake Each street and spire and roof , incontinent . Then would I seek where God might guide my steps , Deep in a woodland tract , a sunny farm , Amid the mountain counties , Hants , Franklin , Berks , Where down the rock ravine a river roars , Even from a brook , and where old woods Not tamed and cleared cumber the ground With their centennial wrecks . Find me a slope where I can feel the sun And mark the rising of the early stars . There will I bring my books ,— my household gods , The reliquaries of my dead saint , and dwell In the sweet odor of her memory . Then in the uncouth solitude unlock My stock of art , plant dials in the grass , Hang in the air a bright thermometer And aim a telescope at the inviolate sun . CHARDON ST ., BOSTON , 1831 . Day by day returns The everlasting sun , Replenishing material urns With God 's unspared donation ; But the day of day , The orb within the mind , Creating fair and good alway , Shines not as once it shined . Vast the realm of Being is , In the waste one nook is his ; Whatsoever hap befalls In his vision 's narrow walls He is here to testify . 1831 . HYMN There is in all the sons of men A love that in the spirit dwells , That panteth after things unseen , And tidings of the future tells . And God hath built his altar here To keep this fire of faith alive , And sent his priests in holy fear To speak the truth — for truth to strive . And hither come the pensive train Of rich and poor , of young and old , Of ardent youth untouched by pain , Of thoughtful maids and manhood bold . They seek a friend to speak the word Already trembling on their tongue , To touch with prophet 's hand the chord Which God in human hearts hath strung . To speak the plain reproof of sin That sounded in the soul before , And bid you let the angels in That knock at meek contrition 's door . A friend to lift the curtain up That hides from man the mortal goal , And with glad thoughts of faith and hope Surprise the exulting soul . Sole source of light and hope assured , O touch thy servant 's lips with power , So shall he speak to us the word Thyself dost give forever more . June , 1831 . SELF-RELIANCE Henceforth , please God , forever I forego The yoke of men 's opinions . I will be Light-hearted as a bird , and live with God . I find him in the bottom of my heart , I hear continually his voice therein . The little needle always knows the North , The little bird remembereth his note , And this wise Seer within me never errs . I never taught it what it teaches me ; I only follow , when I act aright . October 9 , 1832 . And when I am entombed in my place , Be it remembered of a single man , He never , though he dearly loved his race , For fear of human eyes swerved from his plan . Oh what is Heaven but the fellowship Of minds that each can stand against the world By its own meek and incorruptible will ? The days pass over me And I am still the same ; The aroma of my life is gone With the flower with which it came . 1833 . WRITTEN IN NAPLES We are what we are made ; each following day Is the Creator of our human mould Not less than was the first ; the all-wise God Gilds a few points in every several life , And as each flower upon the fresh hillside , And every colored petal of each flower , Is sketched and dyed , each with a new design , Its spot of purple , and its streak of brown , So each man 's life shall have its proper lights , And a few joys , a few peculiar charms , For him round in the melancholy hours And reconcile him to the common days . Not many men see beauty in the fogs Of close low pine-woods in a river town ; Yet unto me not morn 's magnificence , Nor the red rainbow of a summer eve , Nor Rome , nor joyful Paris , nor the halls Of rich men blazing hospitable light , Nor wit , nor eloquence ,— no , nor even the song Of any woman that is now alive ,— Hath such a soul , such divine influence , Such resurrection of the happy past , As is to me when I behold the morn Ope in such law moist roadside , and beneath Peep the blue violets out of the black loam , Pathetic silent poets that sing to me Thine elegy , sweet singer , sainted wife . March , 1833 . WRITTEN AT ROME Alone in Rome . Why , Rome is lonely too ;— Besides , you need not be alone ; the soul Shall have society of its own rank . Be great , be true , and all the Scipios , The Catos , the wise patriots of Rome , Shall flock to you and tarry by your side , And comfort you with their high company . Virtue alone is sweet society , It keeps the key to all heroic hearts , And opens you a welcome in them all . You must be like them if you desire them , Scorn trifles and embrace a better aim Than wine or sleep or praise ; Hunt knowledge as the lover wooes a maid , And ever in the strife of your own thoughts Obey the nobler impulse ; that is Rome : That shall command a senate to your side ; For there is no might in the universe That can contend with love . It reigns forever . Wait then , sad friend , wait in majestic peace The hour of heaven . Generously trust Thy fortune 's web to the beneficent hand That until now has put his world in fee To thee . He watches for thee still . His love Broods over thee , and as God lives in heaven , However long thou walkest solitary , The hour of heaven shall come , the man appear . 1833 . WEBSTER 1831 Let Webster 's lofty face Ever on thousands shine , A beacon set that Freedom 's race Might gather omens from that radiant sign . FROM THE PHI BETA KAPPA POEM 1834 Ill fits the abstemious Muse a crown to weave For living brows ; ill fits them to receive : And yet , if virtue abrogate the law , One portrait — fact or fancy — we may draw ; A form which Nature cast in the heroic mould Of them who rescued liberty of old ; He , when the rising storm of party roared , Brought his great forehead to the council board , There , while hot heads perplexed with fears the state , Calm as the morn the manly patriot sate ; Seemed , when at last his clarion accents broke , As if the conscience of the country spoke . Not on its base Monadnoc surer stood , Than he to common sense and common good : No mimic ; from his breast his counsel drew , Believed the eloquent was aye the true ; He bridged the gulf from th ’ alway good and wise To that within the vision of small eyes . Self-centred ; when he launched the genuine word It shook or captivated all who heard , Ran from his mouth to mountains and the sea , And burned in noble hearts proverb and prophecy . 1854 Why did all manly gifts in Webster fail ? He wrote on Nature 's grandest brow , For Sale .</p>

Why , Rome is lonely too Already blushes on thy cheek And as the light divides the dark And Ellen , when the graybeard years And I behold once more And when I am entombed in my place Announced by all the trumpets of the sky Around the man who seeks a noble end Ascending thorough just degrees Askest , ‘ How long thou shalt stay ? ’ As sings the pine-tree in the wind As sunbeams stream through liberal space As the drop feeds its fated flower Atom from atom yawns as far</item>
