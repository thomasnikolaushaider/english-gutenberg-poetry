    <docImprint>To drop his galley 's straining oar , And press , in summer warmth and calm , The lap of some enchanted shore Of blossom and of balm . Grudge not my life its hour of bloom , My heart its taste of long desire ; This day be mine : be those to come As duty shall require . The deep voice answered to my own , Smiting my selfish prayers away ; “ To-morrow is with God alone , And man hath but to-day . “ Say not , thy fond , vain heart within , The Father 's arm shall still be wide , When from these pleasant ways of sin Thou turn'st at eventide . “ ‘ Cast thyself down , ’ the tempter saith , ‘ And angels shall thy feet upbear . ’ He bids thee make a lie of faith , And blasphemy of prayer . “ Though God be good and free be heaven , No force divine can love compel ; And , though the song of sins forgiven May sound through lowest hell , “ The sweet persuasion of His voice Respects thy sanctity of will . He giveth day : thou hast thy choice To walk in darkness still ; “ As one who , turning from the light , Watches his own gray shadow fall , Doubting , upon his path of night , If there be day at all ! “ No word of doom may shut thee out , No wind of wrath may downward whirl , No swords of fire keep watch about The open gates of pearl ; “ A tenderer light than moon or sun , Than song of earth a sweeter hymn , May shine and sound forever on , And thou be deaf and dim . “ Forever round the Mercy-seat The guiding lights of Love shall burn ; But what if , habit-bound , thy feet Shall lack the will to turn ? “ What if thine eye refuse to see , Thine ear of Heaven 's free welcome fail , And thou a willing captive be , Thyself thy own dark jail ? “ Oh , doom beyond the saddest guess , As the long years of God unroll , To make thy dreary selfishness The prison of a soul !</docImprint>
    <docDate>“ To doubt the love that fain would break The fetters from thy self-bound limb ; And dream that God can thee forsake As thou forsakest Him ! ”<date>1863</date>. THE ETERNAL GOODNESS . O friends ! with whom my feet have trod The quiet aisles of prayer , Glad witness to your zeal for God And love of man I bear . I trace your lines of argument ; Your logic linked and strong I weigh as one who dreads dissent , And fears a doubt as wrong . But still my human hands are weak To hold your iron creeds Against the words ye bid me speak My heart within me pleads . Who fathoms the Eternal Thought ? Who talks of scheme and plan ? The Lord is God ! He needeth not The poor device of man . I walk with bare , hushed feet the ground Ye tread with boldness shod ; I dare not fix with mete and bound The love and power of God . Ye praise His justice ; even such His pitying love I deem Ye seek a king ; I fain would touch The robe that hath no seam . Ye see the curse which overbroods A world of pain and loss ; I hear our Lord 's beatitudes And prayer upon the cross . More than your schoolmen teach , within Myself , alas ! I know Too dark ye cannot paint the sin , Too small the merit show . I bow my forehead to the dust , I veil mine eyes for shame , And urge , in trembling self-distrust , A prayer without a claim . I see the wrong that round me lies , I feel the guilt within ; I hear , with groan and travail-cries , The world confess its sin . Yet , in the maddening maze of things , And tossed by storm and flood , To one fixed trust my spirit clings ; I know that God is good ! Not mine to look where cherubim And seraphs may not see , But nothing can be good in Him Which evil is in me . The wrong that pains my soul below I dare not throne above , I know not of His hate ,— I know His goodness and His love . I dimly guess from blessings known Of greater out of sight , And , with the chastened Psalmist , own His judgments too are right . I long for household voices gone , For vanished smiles I long , But God hath led my dear ones on , And He can do no wrong . I know not what the future hath Of marvel or surprise , Assured alone that life and death His mercy underlies . And if my heart and flesh are weak To bear an untried pain , The bruised reed He will not break , But strengthen and sustain . No offering of my own I have , Nor works my faith to prove ; I can but give the gifts He gave , And plead His love for love . And so beside the Silent Sea I wait the muffled oar ; No harm from Him can come to me On ocean or on shore . I know not where His islands lift Their fronded palms in air ; I only know I cannot drift Beyond His love and care . O brothers ! if my faith is vain , If hopes like these betray , Pray for me that my feet may gain The sure and safer way . And Thou , O Lord ! by whom are seen Thy creatures as they be , Forgive me if too close I lean My human heart on Thee !<date>1865</date>. THE COMMON QUESTION . Behind us at our evening meal The gray bird ate his fill , Swung downward by a single claw , And wiped his hooked bill . He shook his wings and crimson tail , And set his head aslant , And , in his sharp , impatient way , Asked , “ What does Charlie want ? ” “ Fie , silly bird ! ” I answered , “ tuck Your head beneath your wing , And go to sleep ; ” — but o'er and o'er He asked the self-same thing . Then , smiling , to myself I said How like are men and birds ! We all are saying what he says , In action or in words . The boy with whip and top and drum , The girl with hoop and doll , And men with lands and houses , ask The question of Poor Poll . However full , with something more We fain the bag would cram ; We sigh above our crowded nets For fish that never swam . No bounty of indulgent Heaven The vague desire can stay ; Self-love is still a Tartar mill For grinding prayers alway . The dear God hears and pities all ; He knoweth all our wants ; And what we blindly ask of Him His love withholds or grants . And so I sometimes think our prayers Might well be merged in one ; And nest and perch and hearth and church Repeat , “ Thy will be done . ” OUR MASTER . Immortal Love , forever full , Forever flowing free , Forever shared , forever whole , A never-ebbing sea ! Our outward lips confess the name All other names above ; Love only knoweth whence it came And comprehendeth love . Blow , winds of God , awake and blow The mists of earth away ! Shine out , O Light Divine , and show How wide and far we stray ! Hush every lip , close every book , The strife of tongues forbear ; Why forward reach , or backward look , For love that clasps like air ? We may not climb the heavenly steeps To bring the Lord Christ down In vain we search the lowest deeps , For Him no depths can drown . Nor holy bread , nor blood of grape , The lineaments restore Of Him we know in outward shape And in the flesh no more . He cometh not a king to reign ; The world 's long hope is dim ; The weary centuries watch in vain The clouds of heaven for Him . Death comes , life goes ; the asking eye And ear are answerless ; The grave is dumb , the hollow sky Is sad with silentness . The letter fails , and systems fall , And every symbol wanes ; The Spirit over-brooding all Eternal Love remains . And not for signs in heaven above Or earth below they look , Who know with John His smile of love , With Peter His rebuke . In joy of inward peace , or sense Of sorrow over sin , He is His own best evidence , His witness is within . No fable old , nor mythic lore , Nor dream of bards and seers , No dead fact stranded on the shore Of the oblivious years ;— But warm , sweet , tender , even yet A present help is He ; And faith has still its Olivet , And love its Galilee .</docDate>
    <docImprint>The healing of His seamless dress Is by our beds of pain ; We touch Him in life 's throng and press , And we are whole again . Through Him the first fond prayers are said Our lips of childhood frame , The last low whispers of our dead Are burdened with His name . Our Lord and Master of us all ! Whate'er our name or sign , We own Thy sway , we hear Thy call , We test our lives by Thine . Thou judgest us ; Thy purity Doth all our lusts condemn ; The love that draws us nearer Thee Is hot with wrath to them . Our thoughts lie open to Thy sight ; And , naked to Thy glance , Our secret sins are in the light Of Thy pure countenance . Thy healing pains , a keen distress Thy tender light shines in ; Thy sweetness is the bitterness , Thy grace the pang of sin . Yet , weak and blinded though we be , Thou dost our service own ; We bring our varying gifts to Thee , And Thou rejectest none . To Thee our full humanity , Its joys and pains , belong ; The wrong of man to man on Thee Inflicts a deeper wrong . Who hates , hates Thee , who loves becomes Therein to Thee allied ; All sweet accords of hearts and homes In Thee are multiplied . Deep strike Thy roots , O heavenly Vine , Within our earthly sod , Most human and yet most divine , The flower of man and God ! O Love ! O Life ! Our faith and sight Thy presence maketh one As through transfigured clouds of white We trace the noon-day sun . So , to our mortal eyes subdued , Flesh-veiled , but not concealed , We know in Thee the fatherhood And heart of God revealed . We faintly hear , we dimly see , In differing phrase we pray ; But , dim or clear , we own in Thee The Light , the Truth , the Way ! The homage that we render Thee Is still our Father 's own ; No jealous claim or rivalry Divides the Cross and Throne . To do Thy will is more than praise , As words are less than deeds , And simple trust can find Thy ways We miss with chart of creeds . No pride of self Thy service hath , No place for me and mine ; Our human strength is weakness , death Our life , apart from Thine . Apart from Thee all gain is loss , All labor vainly done ; The solemn shadow of Thy Cross Is better than the sun . Alone , O Love ineffable ! Thy saving name is given ; To turn aside from Thee is hell , To walk with Thee is heaven ! How vain , secure in all Thou art , Our noisy championship The sighing of the contrite heart Is more than flattering lip . Not Thine the bigot 's partial plea , Nor Thine the zealot 's ban ; Thou well canst spare a love of Thee Which ends in hate of man . Our Friend , our Brother , and our Lord , What may Thy service be ?— Nor name , nor form , nor ritual word , But simply following Thee . We bring no ghastly holocaust , We pile no graven stone ; He serves thee best who loveth most His brothers and Thy own . Thy litanies , sweet offices Of love and gratitude ; Thy sacramental liturgies , The joy of doing good . In vain shall waves of incense drift The vaulted nave around , In vain the minster turret lift Its brazen weights of sound .</docImprint>
    <docDate>The heart must ring Thy Christmas bells , Thy inward altars raise ; Its faith and hope Thy canticles , And its obedience praise !<date>1866</date>. THE MEETING . The two speakers in the meeting referred to in this poem were Avis Keene , whose very presence was a benediction , a woman lovely in spirit and person , whose words seemed a message of love and tender concern to her hearers ; and Sibyl Jones , whose inspired eloquence and rare spirituality impressed all who knew her . In obedience to her apprehended duty she made visits of Christian love to various parts of Europe , and to the West Coast of Africa and Palestine . The elder folks shook hands at last , Down seat by seat the signal passed . To simple ways like ours unused , Half solemnized and half amused , With long-drawn breath and shrug , my guest His sense of glad relief expressed . Outside , the hills lay warm in sun ; The cattle in the meadow-run Stood half-leg deep ; a single bird The green repose above us stirred . “ What part or lot have you , ” he said , “ In these dull rites of drowsy-head ? Is silence worship ? Seek it where It soothes with dreams the summer air , Not in this close and rude-benched hall , But where soft lights and shadows fall , And all the slow , sleep-walking hours Glide soundless over grass and flowers ! From time and place and form apart , Its holy ground the human heart , Nor ritual-bound nor templeward Walks the free spirit of the Lord ! Our common Master did not pen His followers up from other men ; His service liberty indeed , He built no church , He framed no creed ; But while the saintly Pharisee Made broader his phylactery , As from the synagogue was seen The dusty-sandalled Nazarene Through ripening cornfields lead the way Upon the awful Sabbath day , His sermons were the healthful talk That shorter made the mountain-walk , His wayside texts were flowers and birds , Where mingled with His gracious words The rustle of the tamarisk-tree And ripple-wash of Galilee . ” “ Thy words are well , O friend , ” I said ; “ Unmeasured and unlimited , With noiseless slide of stone to stone , The mystic Church of God has grown . Invisible and silent stands The temple never made with hands , Unheard the voices still and small Of its unseen confessional . He needs no special place of prayer Whose hearing ear is everywhere ; He brings not back the childish days That ringed the earth with stones of praise , Roofed Karnak 's hall of gods , and laid The plinths of Phil e 's colonnade . Still less He owns the selfish good And sickly growth of solitude ,— The worthless grace that , out of sight , Flowers in the desert anchorite ; Dissevered from the suffering whole , Love hath no power to save a soul . Not out of Self , the origin And native air and soil of sin , The living waters spring and flow , The trees with leaves of healing grow . “ Dream not , O friend , because I seek This quiet shelter twice a week , I better deem its pine-laid floor Than breezy hill or sea-sung shore ; But nature is not solitude She crowds us with her thronging wood ; Her many hands reach out to us , Her many tongues are garrulous ; Perpetual riddles of surprise She offers to our ears and eyes ; She will not leave our senses still , But drags them captive at her will And , making earth too great for heaven , She hides the Giver in the given .</docDate>
    <docTitle><titlePart>“ And so , I find it well to come For deeper rest to this still room , For here the habit of the soul Feels less the outer world 's control ; The strength of mutual purpose pleads More earnestly our common needs ; And from the silence multiplied By these still forms on either side , The world that time and sense have known Falls off and leaves us God alone . “ Yet rarely through the charmed repose Unmixed the stream of motive flows , A flavor of its many springs , The tints of earth and sky it brings ; In the still waters needs must be Some shade of human sympathy ; And here , in its accustomed place , I look on memory 's dearest face ; The blind by-sitter guesseth not What shadow haunts that vacant spot ; No eyes save mine alone can see The love wherewith it welcomes me ! And still , with those alone my kin , In doubt and weakness , want and sin , I bow my head , my heart I bare As when that face was living there , And strive ( too oft , alas ! in vain ) The peace of simple trust to gain , Fold fancy 's restless wings , and lay The idols of my heart away . “ Welcome the silence all unbroken , Nor less the words of fitness spoken ,— Such golden words as hers for whom Our autumn flowers have just made room ; Whose hopeful utterance through and through The freshness of the morning blew ; Who loved not less the earth that light Fell on it from the heavens in sight , But saw in all fair forms more fair The Eternal beauty mirrored there . Whose eighty years but added grace And saintlier meaning to her face ,— The look of one who bore away Glad tidings from the hills of day , While all our hearts went forth to meet The coming of her beautiful feet ! Or haply hers , whose pilgrim tread Is in the paths where Jesus led ; Who dreams her childhood 's Sabbath dream By Jordan 's willow-shaded stream , And , of the hymns of hope and faith , Sung by the monks of Nazareth , Hears pious echoes , in the call To prayer , from Moslem minarets fall , Repeating where His works were wrought The lesson that her Master taught , Of whom an elder Sibyl gave , The prophecies of Cuma ‘ s cave . “ I ask no organ 's soulless breath To drone the themes of life and death , No altar candle-lit by day , No ornate wordsman 's rhetoric-play , No cool philosophy to teach Its bland audacities of speech To double-tasked idolaters Themselves their gods and worshippers , No pulpit hammered by the fist Of loud-asserting dogmatist , Who borrows for the Hand of love The smoking thunderbolts of Jove . I know how well the fathers taught , What work the later schoolmen wrought ; I reverence old-time faith and men , But God is near us now as then ; His force of love is still unspent , His hate of sin as imminent ; And still the measure of our needs Outgrows the cramping bounds of creeds ; The manna gathered yesterday Already savors of decay ; Doubts to the world 's child-heart unknown Question us now from star and stone ; Too little or too much we know , And sight is swift and faith is slow ; The power is lost to self-deceive With shallow forms of make-believe . W e walk at high noon , and the bells Call to a thousand oracles , But the sound deafens , and the light Is stronger than our dazzled sight ; The letters of the sacred Book Glimmer and swim beneath our look ; Still struggles in the Age 's breast With deepening agony of quest The old entreaty : ‘ Art thou He , Or look we for the Christ to be ? ’ “ God should be most where man is least So , where is neither church nor priest , And never rag of form or creed To clothe the nakedness of need ,— Where farmer-folk in silence meet ,— I turn my bell-unsummoned feet ; ’ I lay the critic 's glass aside , I tread upon my lettered pride , And , lowest-seated , testify To the oneness of humanity ; Confess the universal want , And share whatever Heaven may grant . He findeth not who seeks his own , The soul is lost that 's saved alone . Not on one favored forehead fell Of old the fire-tongued miracle , But flamed o'er all the thronging host The baptism of the Holy Ghost ; Heart answers heart : in one desire The blending lines of prayer aspire ; ‘ Where , in my name , meet two or three , ’ Our Lord hath said , ‘ I there will be ! ’ “ So sometimes comes to soul and sense The feeling which is evidence That very near about us lies The realm of spiritual mysteries . The sphere of the supernal powers Impinges on this world of ours . The low and dark horizon lifts , To light the scenic terror shifts ; The breath of a diviner air Blows down the answer of a prayer That all our sorrow , pain , and doubt A great compassion clasps about , And law and goodness , love and force , Are wedded fast beyond divorce . Then duty leaves to love its task , The beggar Self forgets to ask ; With smile of trust and folded hands , The passive soul in waiting stands To feel , as flowers the sun and dew , The One true Life its own renew .</titlePart></docTitle>
    <docDate>“ So , to the calmly gathered thought The innermost of truth is taught , The mystery dimly understood , That love of God is love of good , And , chiefly , its divinest trace In Him of Nazareth 's holy face ; That to be saved is only this ,— Salvation from our selfishness , From more than elemental fire , The soul 's unsanetified desire , From sin itself , and not the pain That warns us of its chafing chain ; That worship 's deeper meaning lies In mercy , and not sacrifice , Not proud humilities of sense And posturing of penitence , But love 's unforced obedience ; That Book and Church and Day are given For man , not God ,— for earth , not heaven ,— The blessed means to holiest ends , Not masters , but benignant friends ; That the dear Christ dwells not afar , The king of some remoter star , Listening , at times , with flattered ear To homage wrung from selfish fear , But here , amidst the poor and blind , The bound and suffering of our kind , In works we do , in prayers we pray , Life of our life , He lives to-day . ”<date>1868</date>. THE CLEAR VISION . I did but dream . I never knew What charms our sternest season wore . Was never yet the sky so blue , Was never earth so white before . Till now I never saw the glow Of sunset on yon hills of snow , And never learned the bough 's designs Of beauty in its leafless lines . Did ever such a morning break As that my eastern windows see ? Did ever such a moonlight take Weird photographs of shrub and tree ? Rang ever bells so wild and fleet The music of the winter street ? Was ever yet a sound by half So merry as you school-boy 's laugh ? O Earth ! with gladness overfraught , No added charm thy face hath found ; Within my heart the change is wrought , My footsteps make enchanted ground . From couch of pain and curtained room Forth to thy light and air I come , To find in all that meets my eyes The freshness of a glad surprise . Fair seem these winter days , and soon Shall blow the warm west-winds of spring , To set the unbound rills in tune And hither urge the bluebird 's wing . The vales shall laugh in flowers , the woods Grow misty green with leafing buds , And violets and wind-flowers sway Against the throbbing heart of May . Break forth , my lips , in praise , and own The wiser love severely kind ; Since , richer for its chastening grown , I see , whereas I once was blind . The world , O Father ! hath not wronged With loss the life by Thee prolonged ; But still , with every added year , More beautiful Thy works appear !</docDate>
    <docImprint>As Thou hast made thy world without , Make Thou more fair my world within ; Shine through its lingering clouds of doubt ; Rebuke its haunting shapes of sin ; Fill , brief or long , my granted span Of life with love to thee and man ; Strike when thou wilt the hour of rest , But let my last days be my best ! 2d mo .,<date>1868</date>. DIVINE COMPASSION . Long since , a dream of heaven I had , And still the vision haunts me oft ; I see the saints in white robes clad , The martyrs with their palms aloft ; But hearing still , in middle song , The ceaseless dissonance of wrong ; And shrinking , with hid faces , from the strain Of sad , beseeching eyes , full of remorse and pain . The glad song falters to a wail , The harping sinks to low lament ; Before the still unlifted veil I see the crowned foreheads bent , Making more sweet the heavenly air , With breathings of unselfish prayer ; And a Voice saith : “ O Pity which is pain , O Love that weeps , fill up my sufferings which remain ! “ Shall souls redeemed by me refuse To share my sorrow in their turn ? Or , sin-forgiven , my gift abuse Of peace with selfish unconcern ? Has saintly ease no pitying care ? Has faith no work , and love no prayer ? While sin remains , and souls in darkness dwell , Can heaven itself be heaven , and look unmoved on hell ? ” Then through the Gates of Pain , I dream , A wind of heaven blows coolly in ; Fainter the awful discords seem , The smoke of torment grows more thin , Tears quench the burning soil , and thence Spring sweet , pale flowers of penitence And through the dreary realm of man 's despair , Star-crowned an angel walks , and to ! God 's hope is there !</docImprint>
    <docDate>Is it a dream ? Is heaven so high That pity cannot breathe its air ? Its happy eyes forever dry , Its holy lips without a prayer ! My God ! my God ! if thither led By Thy free grace unmerited , No crown nor palm be mine , but let me keep A heart that still can feel , and eyes that still can weep .<date>1868</date>. THE PRAYER-SEEKER . Along the aisle where prayer was made , A woman , all in black arrayed , Close-veiled , between the kneeling host , With gliding motion of a ghost , Passed to the desk , and laid thereon A scroll which bore these words alone , Pray for me !</docDate>
    <docTitle><titlePart>Back from the place of worshipping She glided like a guilty thing The rustle of her draperies , stirred By hurrying feet , alone was heard ; While , full of awe , the preacher read , As out into the dark she sped : “ Pray for me ! ” Back to the night from whence she came , To unimagined grief or shame ! Across the threshold of that door None knew the burden that she bore ; Alone she left the written scroll , The legend of a troubled soul ,— Pray for me ! Glide on , poor ghost of woe or sin ! Thou leav'st a common need within ; Each bears , like thee , some nameless weight , Some misery inarticulate , Some secret sin , some shrouded dread , Some household sorrow all unsaid . Pray for us ! Pass on ! The type of all thou art , Sad witness to the common heart ! With face in veil and seal on lip , In mute and strange companionship , Like thee we wander to and fro , Dumbly imploring as we go Pray for us ! Ah , who shall pray , since he who pleads Our want perchance hath greater needs ? Yet they who make their loss the gain Of others shall not ask in vain , And Heaven bends low to hear the prayer Of love from lips of self-despair Pray for us ! In vain remorse and fear and hate Beat with bruised bands against a fate Whose walls of iron only move And open to the touch of love . He only feels his burdens fall Who , taught by suffering , pities all . Pray for us !</titlePart></docTitle>
    <docDate>He prayeth best who leaves unguessed The mystery of another 's breast . Why cheeks grow pale , why eyes o'erflow , Or heads are white , thou need'st not know . Enough to note by many a sign That every heart hath needs like thine . Pray for us !<date>1870</date>THE BREWING OF SOMA .</docDate>
    <epigraph>
     <p>“ These libations mixed with milk have been prepared for Indra : offer Soma to the drinker of Soma . ” — Vashista , translated by MAX MULLER . The fagots blazed , the caldron 's smoke Up through the green wood curled ; “ Bring honey from the hollow oak , Bring milky sap , ” the brewers spoke , In the childhood of the world . And brewed they well or brewed they ill , The priests thrust in their rods , First tasted , and then drank their fill , And shouted , with one voice and will , “ Behold the drink of gods ! ” They drank , and to ! in heart and brain A new , glad life began ; The gray of hair grew young again , The sick man laughed away his pain , The cripple leaped and ran . “ Drink , mortals , what the gods have sent , Forget your long annoy . ” So sang the priests . From tent to tent The Soma 's sacred madness went , A storm of drunken joy . Then knew each rapt inebriate A winged and glorious birth , Soared upward , with strange joy elate , Beat , with dazed head , Varuna 's gate , And , sobered , sank to earth . The land with Soma 's praises rang ; On Gihon 's banks of shade Its hymns the dusky maidens sang ; In joy of life or mortal pang All men to Soma prayed . The morning twilight of the race Sends down these matin psalms ; And still with wondering eyes we trace The simple prayers to Soma 's grace , That Vedic verse embalms .</p>
    </epigraph>
    <docTitle><titlePart>As in that child-world 's early year , Each after age has striven By music , incense , vigils drear , And trance , to bring the skies more near , Or lift men up to heaven ! Some fever of the blood and brain , Some self-exalting spell , The scourger 's keen delight of pain , The Dervish dance , the Orphic strain , The wild-haired Bacchant 's yell ,— The desert 's hair-grown hermit sunk The saner brute below ; The naked Santon , hashish-drunk , The cloister madness of the monk , The fakir 's torture-show ! And yet the past comes round again , And new doth old fulfil ; In sensual transports wild as vain We brew in many a Christian fane The heathen Soma still ! Dear Lord and Father of mankind , Forgive our foolish ways ! Reclothe us in our rightful mind , In purer lives Thy service find , In deeper reverence , praise . In simple trust like theirs who heard Beside the Syrian sea The gracious calling of the Lord , Let us , like them , without a word , Rise up and follow Thee . O Sabbath rest by Galilee ! O calm of hills above , Where Jesus knelt to share with Thee The silence of eternity Interpreted by love ! With that deep hush subduing all Our words and works that drown The tender whisper of Thy call , As noiseless let Thy blessing fall As fell Thy manna down . Drop Thy still dews of quietness , Till all our strivings cease ; Take from our souls the strain and stress , And let our ordered lives confess The beauty of Thy peace .</titlePart></docTitle>
    <docDate>Breathe through the heats of our desire Thy coolness and Thy balm ; Let sense be dumb , let flesh retire ; Speak through the earthquake , wind , and fire , O still , small voice of calm !<date>1872</date>. A WOMAN . Oh , dwarfed and wronged , and stained with ill , Behold ! thou art a woman still ! And , by that sacred name and dear , I bid thy better self appear . Still , through thy foul disguise , I see The rudimental purity , That , spite of change and loss , makes good Thy birthright-claim of womanhood ; An inward loathing , deep , intense ; A shame that is half innocence . Cast off the grave-clothes of thy sin ! Rise from the dust thou liest in , As Mary rose at Jesus ’ word , Redeemed and white before the Lord ! Reclairn thy lost soul ! In His name , Rise up , and break thy bonds of shame . Art weak ? He ‘ s strong . Art fearful ? Hear The world 's O'ercomer : “ Be of cheer ! ” What lip shall judge when He approves ? Who dare to scorn the child He loves ? THE PRAYER OF AGASSIZ .</docDate>
    <docImprint>The island of Penikese in Buzzard 's Bay was given by Mr. John Anderson to Agassiz for the uses of a summer school of natural history . A large barn was cleared and improvised as a lecture-room . Here , on the first morning of the school , all the company was gathered . “ Agassiz had arranged no programme of exercises , ” says Mrs. Agassiz , in Louis Agassiz ; his Life and Correspondence , “ trusting to the interest of the occasion to suggest what might best be said or done . But , as he looked upon his pupils gathered there to study nature with him , by an impulse as natural as it was unpremeditated , he called upon then to join in silently asking God 's blessing on their work together . The pause was broken by the first words of an address no less fervent than its unspoken prelude . ” This was in the summer of<date>1873</date>, and Agassiz died the December following . On the isle of Penikese , Ringed about by sapphire seas , Fanned by breezes salt and cool , Stood the Master with his school . Over sails that not in vain Wooed the west-wind 's steady strain , Line of coast that low and far Stretched its undulating bar , Wings aslant along the rim Of the waves they stooped to skim , Rock and isle and glistening bay , Fell the beautiful white day .</docImprint>
    <docTitle><titlePart>Said the Master to the youth “ We have come in search of truth , Trying with uncertain key Door by door of mystery ; We are reaching , through His laws , To the garment-hem of Cause , Him , the endless , unbegun , The Unnamable , the One Light of all our light the Source , Life of life , and Force of force . As with fingers of the blind , We are groping here to find What the hieroglyphics mean Of the Unseen in the seen , What the Thought which underlies Nature 's masking and disguise , What it is that hides beneath Blight and bloom and birth and death . By past efforts unavailing , Doubt and error , loss and failing , Of our weakness made aware , On the threshold of our task Let us light and guidance ask , Let us pause in silent prayer ! ” Then the Master in his place Bowed his head a little space , And the leaves by soft airs stirred , Lapse of wave and cry of bird , Left the solemn hush unbroken Of that wordless prayer unspoken , While its wish , on earth unsaid , Rose to heaven interpreted . As , in life 's best hours , we hear By the spirit 's finer ear His low voice within us , thus The All-Father heareth us ; And His holy ear we pain With our noisy words and vain . Not for Him our violence Storming at the gates of sense , His the primal language , His The eternal silences ! Even the careless heart was moved , And the doubting gave assent , With a gesture reverent , To the Master well-beloved . As thin mists are glorified By the light they cannot hide , All who gazed upon him saw , Through its veil of tender awe , How his face was still uplit By the old sweet look of it . Hopeful , trustful , full of cheer , And the love that casts out fear . Who the secret may declare Of that brief , unuttered prayer ? Did the shade before him come Of th ’ inevitable doom , Of the end of earth so near , And Eternity 's new year ?</titlePart></docTitle>
    <docDate>In the lap of sheltering seas Rests the isle of Penikese ; But the lord of the domain Comes not to his own again Where the eyes that follow fail , On a vaster sea his sail Drifts beyond our beck and hail . Other lips within its bound Shall the laws of life expound ; Other eyes from rock and shell Read the world 's old riddles well But when breezes light and bland Blow from Summer 's blossomed land , When the air is glad with wings , And the blithe song-sparrow sings , Many an eye with his still face Shall the living ones displace , Many an ear the word shall seek He alone could fitly speak . And one name forevermore Shall be uttered o'er and o'er By the waves that kiss the shore , By the curlew 's whistle sent Down the cool , sea-scented air ; In all voices known to her , Nature owns her worshipper , Half in triumph , half lament . Thither Love shall tearful turn , Friendship pause uncovered there , And the wisest reverence learn From the Master 's silent prayer .<date>1873</date>.</docDate>

     <p>A CHRISTMAS CARMEN .</p>
     <p>I . Sound over all waters , reach out from all lands , The chorus of voices , the clasping of hands ; Sing hymns that were sung by the stars of the morn , Sing songs of the angels when Jesus was born ! With glad jubilations Bring hope to the nations The dark night is ending and dawn has begun Rise , hope of the ages , arise like the sun , All speech flow to music , all hearts beat as one !</p>
     <p>II . Sing the bridal of nations ! with chorals of love Sing out the war-vulture and sing in the dove , Till the hearts of the peoples keep time in accord , And the voice of the world is the voice of the Lord ! Clasp hands of the nations In strong gratulations : The dark night is ending and dawn has begun ; Rise , hope of the ages , arise like the sun , All speech flow to music , all hearts beat as one !</p>
     <p>III . Blow , bugles of battle , the marches of peace ; East , west , north , and south let the long quarrel cease Sing the song of great joy that the angels began , Sing of glory to God and of good-will to man ! Hark ! joining in chorus The heavens bend o'er us ’ The dark night is ending and dawn has begun ; Rise , hope of the ages , arise like the sun , All speech flow to music , all hearts beat as one ! 1873 .</p>

     <p>UTTERANCE . But what avail inadequate words to reach The innermost of Truth ? Who shall essay , Blinded and weak , to point and lead the way , Or solve the mystery in familiar speech ? Yet , if it be that something not thy own , Some shadow of the Thought to which our schemes , Creeds , cult , and ritual are at best but dreams , Is even to thy unworthiness made known , Thou mayst not hide what yet thou shouldst not dare To utter lightly , lest on lips of thine The real seem false , the beauty undivine . So , weighing duty in the scale of prayer , Give what seems given thee . It may prove a seed Of goodness dropped in fallow-grounds of need . 1881 .</p>

      <head>THE TWO LOVES</head>

       <l n="1">Smoothing soft the nestling head</l>
       <l n="2">Of a maiden fancy-led ,</l>
       <l n="3">Thus a grave-eyed woman said :</l>

       <l n="4">“ Richest gifts are those we make ,</l>
       <l n="5">Dearer than the love we take</l>

       <l n="7">“ Well I know the heart 's unrest ;</l>

       <l n="10">“ Favors undeserved were mine ;</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="16">“ Heart of mine unsatisfied ,</l>

      <head>ADJUSTMENT .</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">The tree of Faith its bare , dry boughs must shed</l>
       <l n="2">That nearer heaven the living ones may climb ;</l>
       <l n="3">The false must fail , though from our shores of time</l>
       <l n="4">The old lament be heard , “ Great Pan is dead ! ”</l>
       <l n="5">That wail is Error 's , from his high place hurled ;</l>
       <l n="6">This sharp recoil is Evil undertrod ;</l>
       <l n="7">Our time 's unrest , an angel sent of God</l>
       <l n="8">Troubling with life the waters of the world .</l>
       <l n="9">Even as they list the winds of the Spirit blow</l>
       <l n="10">To turn or break our century-rusted vanes ;</l>
       <l n="11">Sands shift and waste ; the rock alone remains</l>
       <l n="12">Where , led of Heaven , the strong tides come and go ,</l>
       <l n="13">And storm-clouds , rent by thunderbolt and wind ,</l>
       <l n="14">Leave , free of mist , the permanent stars behind .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="15">Therefore I trust , although to outward sense</l>
       <l n="16">Both true and false seem shaken ; I will hold</l>
       <l n="17">With newer light my reverence for the old ,</l>
       <l n="18">And calmly wait the births of Providence .</l>
       <l n="19">No gain is lost ; the clear-eyed saints look down</l>
       <l n="20">Untroubled on the wreck of schemes and creeds ;</l>
       <l n="21">Love yet remains , its rosary of good deeds</l>
       <l n="22">Counting in task-field and o'erpeopled town ;</l>
       <l n="23">Truth has charmed life ; the Inward Word survives ,</l>
       <l n="24">And , day by day , its revelation brings ;</l>
       <l n="25">Faith , hope , and charity , whatsoever things</l>
       <l n="26">Which cannot be shaken , stand . Still holy lives</l>
       <l n="27">Reveal the Christ of whom the letter told ,</l>
       <l n="28">And the new gospel verifies the old .</l>

     <p>HYMNS OF THE BRAHMO SOMAJ .</p>
     <p>I have attempted this paraphrase of the Hymns of the Brahmo Somaj of India , as I find them in Mozoomdar 's account of the devotional exercises of that remarkable religious development which has attracted far less attention and sympathy from the Christian world than it deserves , as a fresh revelation of the direct action of the Divine Spirit upon the human heart .</p>
     <p>I . The mercy , O Eternal One ! By man unmeasured yet , In joy or grief , in shade or sun , I never will forget . I give the whole , and not a part , Of all Thou gayest me ; My goods , my life , my soul and heart , I yield them all to Thee !</p>
     <p>II . We fast and plead , we weep and pray , From morning until even ; We feel to find the holy way , We knock at the gate of heaven And when in silent awe we wait , And word and sign forbear , The hinges of the golden gate Move , soundless , to our prayer ! Who hears the eternal harmonies Can heed no outward word ; Blind to all else is he who sees The vision of the Lord !</p>
     <p>III . O soul , be patient , restrain thy tears , Have hope , and not despair ; As a tender mother heareth her child God hears the penitent prayer . And not forever shall grief be thine ; On the Heavenly Mother 's breast , Washed clean and white in the waters of joy Shall His seeking child find rest . Console thyself with His word of grace , And cease thy wail of woe , For His mercy never an equal hath , And His love no bounds can know . Lean close unto Him in faith and hope ; How many like thee have found In Him a shelter and home of peace , By His mercy compassed round ! There , safe from sin and the sorrow it brings , They sing their grateful psalms , And rest , at noon , by the wells of God , In the shade of His holy palms ! 1885 .</p>

      <head>REVELATION .</head>
      <head>“ And I went into the Vale of Beavor , and as I went I preached repentance to the people . And one morning , sitting by the fire , a great cloud came over me , and a temptation beset me . And it was said : All things come by Nature ; and the Elements and the Stars came over me . And as I sat still and let it alone , a living hope arose in me , and a true Voice which said : There is a living God who made all things . And immediately the cloud and the temptation vanished , and Life rose over all , and my heart was glad and I praised the Living God . ” — Journal of George Fox , 1690 .</head>
