    <head>POET LAUREATE</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Dagonet , the fool , whom Gawain in his moods</l>
     <l n="2">Had made mock-knight of Arthur 's Table Round ,</l>
     <l n="3">At Camelot , high above the yellowing woods ,</l>
     <l n="4">Danced like a wither 'd leaf before the Hall .</l>
     <l n="5">And toward him from the Hall , with harp in hand ,</l>
     <l n="6">And from the crown thereof a carcanet</l>
     <l n="7">Of ruby swaying to and fro , the prize</l>
     <l n="8">Of Tristram in the jousts of yesterday ,</l>
     <l n="9">Came Tristram , saying , “ Why skip ye so , Sir Fool ? ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="10">For Arthur and Sir Lancelot riding once</l>
     <l n="11">Far down beneath a winding wall of rock</l>
     <l n="12">Heard a child wail . A stump of oak half-dead ,</l>
     <l n="13">From roots like some black coil of carven snakes</l>
     <l n="14">Clutch 'd at the crag , and started thro ’ mid-air</l>
     <l n="15">Bearing an eagle 's nest : and thro ’ the tree</l>
     <l n="16">Rush 'd ever a rainy wind , and thro ’ the wind</l>
     <l n="17">Pierced ever a child 's cry : and crag and tree</l>
     <l n="18">Scaling , Sir Lancelot from the perilous nest ,</l>
     <l n="19">This ruby necklace thrice around her neck ,</l>
     <l n="20">And all unscarr 'd from beak or talon , brought</l>
     <l n="21">A maiden babe ; which Arthur pitying took ,</l>
     <l n="22">Then gave it to his Queen to rear : the Queen</l>
     <l n="23">But coldly acquiescing , in her white arms</l>
     <l n="24">Received , and after loved it tenderly ,</l>
     <l n="25">And named it Nestling ; so forgot herself</l>
     <l n="26">A moment , and her cares ; till that young life</l>
     <l n="27">Being smitten in mid-heaven with mortal cold</l>
     <l n="28">Past from her ; and in time the carcanet</l>
     <l n="29">Vext her with plaintive memories of the child :</l>
     <l n="30">So she , delivering it to Arthur , said ,</l>
     <l n="31">“ Take thou the jewels of this dead innocence ,</l>
     <l n="32">And make them , an thou wilt , a tourney-prize . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="33">To whom the King , “ Peace to thine eagle-borne</l>
     <l n="34">Dead nestling , and this honor after death ,</l>
     <l n="35">Following thy will ! but , O my Queen , I muse</l>
     <l n="36">Why ye not wear on arm , or neck , or zone ,</l>
     <l n="37">Those diamonds that I rescued from the tarn ,</l>
     <l n="38">And Lancelot won , methought , for thee to wear . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="39">“ Would rather ye had let them fall , ” she cried ,</l>
     <l n="40">“ Plunge and be lost — ill-fated as they were ,</l>
     <l n="41">A bitterness to me !— ye look amazed ,</l>
     <l n="42">Not knowing they were lost as soon as given —</l>
     <l n="43">Slid from my hands , when I was leaning out</l>
     <l n="44">Above the river — that unhappy child</l>
     <l n="45">Past in her barge : but rosier luck will go</l>
     <l n="46">With these rich jewels , seeing that they came</l>
     <l n="47">Not from the skeleton of a brother-slayer ,</l>
     <l n="48">But the sweet body of a maiden babe .</l>
     <l n="49">Perchance — who knows ?— the purest of thy knights</l>
     <l n="50">May win them for the purest of my maids . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="51">She ended , and the cry of a great jousts</l>
     <l n="52">With trumpet-blowings ran on all the ways</l>
     <l n="53">From Camelot in among the faded fields</l>
     <l n="54">To furthest towers ; and everywhere the knights</l>
     <l n="55">Arm 'd for a day of glory before the King .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="56">But on the hither side of that loud morn</l>
     <l n="57">Into the hall stagger 'd , his visage ribb 'd</l>
     <l n="58">From ear to ear with dogwhip-weals , his nose</l>
     <l n="59">Bridge-broken , one eye out , and one hand off ,</l>
     <l n="60">And one with shatter 'd fingers dangling lame ,</l>
     <l n="61">A churl , to whom indignantly the King ,</l>
     <l n="62">“ My churl , for whom Christ died , what evil beast</l>
     <l n="63">Hath drawn his claws athwart thy face ? or fiend ?</l>
     <l n="64">Man was it who marr 'd Heaven 's image in thee thus ? ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="65">Then , sputtering thro ’ the hedge of splinter 'd teeth ,</l>
     <l n="66">Yet strangers to the tongue , and with blunt stump</l>
     <l n="67">Pitch-blacken 'd sawing the air , said the maim 'd churl ,</l>
     <l n="68">“ He took them and he drave them to his tower —</l>
     <l n="69">Some hold he was a table-knight of thine —</l>
     <l n="70">A hundred goodly ones — the Red Knight , he —</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="71">“ Lord , I was tending swine , and the Red Knight</l>
     <l n="72">Brake in upon me and drave them to his tower ;</l>
     <l n="73">And when I call 'd upon thy name as one</l>
     <l n="74">That doest right by gentle and by churl ,</l>
     <l n="75">Maim 'd me and maul 'd , and would outright have slain ,</l>
     <l n="76">Save that he sware me to a message , saying —</l>
     <l n="77">‘ Tell thou the King and all his liars , that I</l>
     <l n="78">Have founded my Round Table in the North ,</l>
     <l n="79">And whatsoever his own knights have sworn</l>
     <l n="80">My knights have sworn the counter to it — and say</l>
     <l n="81">My tower is full of harlots , like his court ,</l>
     <l n="82">But mine are worthier , seeing they profess</l>
     <l n="83">To be none other than themselves — and say</l>
     <l n="84">My knights are all adulterers like his own ,</l>
     <l n="85">But mine are truer , seeing they profess</l>
     <l n="86">To be none other ; and say his hour is come ,</l>
     <l n="87">The heathen are upon him , his long lance</l>
     <l n="88">Broken , and his Excalibur a straw . ’ ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="89">Then Arthur turn 'd to Kay the seneschal ,</l>
     <l n="90">“ Take thou my churl , and tend him curiously</l>
     <l n="91">Like a king 's heir , till all his hurts be whole .</l>
     <l n="92">The heathen — but that ever-climbing wave ,</l>
     <l n="93">Hurl 'd back again so often in empty foam ,</l>
     <l n="94">Hath lain for years at rest — and renegades ,</l>
     <l n="95">Thieves , bandits , leavings of confusion , whom</l>
     <l n="96">The wholesome realm is purged of otherwhere ,—</l>
     <l n="97">Friends , thro ’ your manhood and your fealty ,— now</l>
     <l n="98">Make their last head like Satan in the North .</l>
     <l n="99">My younger knights , new-made , in whom your flower</l>
     <l n="100">Waits to be solid fruit of golden deeds ,</l>
     <l n="101">Move with me toward their quelling , which achieved ,</l>
     <l n="102">The loneliest ways are safe from shore to shore .</l>
     <l n="103">But thou , Sir Lancelot , sitting in my place</l>
     <l n="104">Enchair 'd to-morrow , arbitrate the field ;</l>
     <l n="105">For wherefore shouldst thou care to mingle with it ,</l>
     <l n="106">Only to yield my Queen her own again ?</l>
     <l n="107">Speak , Lancelot , thou art silent : is it well ? ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="108">Thereto Sir Lancelot answer 'd , “ It is well :</l>
     <l n="109">Yet better if the King abide , and leave</l>
     <l n="110">The leading of his younger knights to me .</l>
     <l n="111">Else , for the King has will 'd it , it is well . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="112">Then Arthur rose and Lancelot follow 'd him ,</l>
     <l n="113">And while they stood without the doors , the King</l>
     <l n="114">Turn 'd to him saying , “ Is it then so well ?</l>
     <l n="115">Or mine the blame that oft I seem as he</l>
     <l n="116">Of whom was written , ‘ a sound is in his ears ’ —</l>
     <l n="117">The foot that loiters , bidden go ,— the glance</l>
     <l n="118">That only seems half-loyal to command ,—</l>
     <l n="119">A manner somewhat fall'n from reverence —</l>
     <l n="120">Or have I dream 'd the bearing of our knights</l>
     <l n="121">Tells of a manhood ever less and lower ?</l>
     <l n="122">Or whence the fear lest this my realm , uprear 'd ,</l>
     <l n="123">By noble deeds at one with noble vows ,</l>
     <l n="124">From flat confusion and brute violences ,</l>
     <l n="125">Reel back into the beast , and be no more ? ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="126">He spoke , and taking all his younger knights ,</l>
     <l n="127">Down the slope city rode , and sharply turn 'd</l>
     <l n="128">North by the gate . In her high bower the Queen ,</l>
     <l n="129">Working a tapestry , lifted up her head ,</l>
     <l n="130">Watch 'd her lord pass , and knew not that she sigh 'd .</l>
     <l n="131">Then ran across her memory the strange rhyme</l>
     <l n="132">Of bygone Merlin , “ Where is he who knows ?</l>
     <l n="133">From the great deep to the great deep he goes . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="134">But when the morning of a tournament ,</l>
     <l n="135">By these in earnest those in mockery call 'd</l>
     <l n="136">The Tournament of the Dead Innocence ,</l>
     <l n="137">Brake with a wet wind blowing , Lancelot ,</l>
     <l n="138">Round whose sick head all night , like birds of prey ,</l>
     <l n="139">The words of Arthur flying shriek 'd , arose ,</l>
     <l n="140">And down a streetway hung with folds of pure</l>
     <l n="141">White samite , and by fountains running wine ,</l>
     <l n="142">Where children sat in white with cups of gold ,</l>
     <l n="143">Moved to the lists , and there , with slow sad steps</l>
     <l n="144">Ascending , fill 'd his double-dragon 'd chair .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="145">He glanced and saw the stately galleries ,</l>
     <l n="146">Dame , damsel , each thro ’ worship of their Queen</l>
     <l n="147">White-robed in honor of the stainless child ,</l>
     <l n="148">And some with scatter 'd jewels , like a bank</l>
     <l n="149">Of maiden snow mingled with sparks of fire .</l>
     <l n="150">He lookt but once , and veil 'd his eyes again .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="151">The sudden trumpet sounded as in a dream</l>
     <l n="152">To ears but half-awaked , then one low roll</l>
     <l n="153">Of Autumn thunder , and the jousts began :</l>
     <l n="154">And ever the wind blew , and yellowing leaf</l>
     <l n="155">And gloom and gleam , and shower and shorn plume</l>
     <l n="156">Went down it . Sighing weariedly , as one</l>
     <l n="157">Who sits and gazes on a faded fire ,</l>
     <l n="158">When all the goodlier guests are past away ,</l>
     <l n="159">Sat their great umpire , looking o'er the lists .</l>
     <l n="160">He saw the laws that ruled the tournament</l>
     <l n="161">Broken , but spake not ; once , a knight cast down</l>
     <l n="162">Before his throne of arbitration cursed</l>
     <l n="163">The dead babe and the follies of the King ;</l>
     <l n="164">And once the laces of a helmet crack 'd ,</l>
     <l n="165">And show 'd him , like a vermin in its hole ,</l>
     <l n="166">Modred , a narrow face : anon he heard</l>
     <l n="167">The voice that billow 'd round the barriers roar</l>
     <l n="168">An ocean-sounding welcome to one knight ,</l>
     <l n="169">But newly-enter 'd , taller than the rest ,</l>
     <l n="170">And armor 'd all in forest green , whereon</l>
     <l n="171">There tript a hundred tiny silver deer ,</l>
     <l n="172">And wearing but a holly-spray for crest ,</l>
     <l n="173">With ever-scattering berries , and on shield</l>
     <l n="174">A spear , a harp , a bugle — Tristram — late</l>
     <l n="175">From overseas in Brittany return 'd ,</l>
     <l n="176">And marriage with a princess of that realm ,</l>
     <l n="177">Isolt the White — Sir Tristram of the Woods —</l>
     <l n="178">Whom Lancelot knew , had held sometime with pain</l>
     <l n="179">His own against him , and now yearn 'd to shake</l>
     <l n="180">The burthen off his heart in one full shock</l>
     <l n="181">With Tristram ev'n to death : his strong hands gript</l>
     <l n="182">And dinted the gilt dragons right and left ,</l>
     <l n="183">Until he groan 'd for wrath — so many of those ,</l>
     <l n="184">That ware their ladies ’ colors on the casque ,</l>
     <l n="185">Drew from before Sir Tristram to the bounds ,</l>
     <l n="186">And there with gibes and nickering mockeries</l>
     <l n="187">Stood , while he mutter 'd , “ Craven chests ! O shame !</l>
     <l n="188">What faith have these in whom they sware to love ?</l>
     <l n="189">The glory of our Round Table is no more . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="190">So Tristram won , and Lancelot gave , the gems ,</l>
     <l n="191">Not speaking other word than “ Hast thou won ?</l>
     <l n="192">Art thou the purest , brother ? See , the hand</l>
     <l n="193">Wherewith thou takest this is red ! ” to whom</l>
     <l n="194">Tristram , half plagued by Lancelot 's languorous mood ,</l>
     <l n="195">Made answer , “ Ay , but wherefore toss me this</l>
     <l n="196">Like a dry bone cast to some hungry hound ?</l>
     <l n="197">Let be thy fair Queen 's fantasy . Strength of heart</l>
     <l n="198">And might of limb , but mainly use and skill ,</l>
     <l n="199">Are winners in this pastime of our King .</l>
     <l n="200">My hand — belike the lance hath dript upon it —</l>
     <l n="201">No blood of mine , I trow ; but O chief knight ,</l>
     <l n="202">Right arm of Arthur in the battlefield ,</l>
     <l n="203">Great brother , thou nor I have made the world ;</l>
     <l n="204">Be happy in thy fair Queen as I in mine . ”</l>
     <l n="205">And Tristram round the gallery made his horse</l>
     <l n="206">Caracole ; then bow 'd his homage , bluntly saying ,</l>
     <l n="207">“ Fair damsels , each to him who worships each</l>
     <l n="208">Sole Queen of Beauty and of love , behold</l>
     <l n="209">This day my Queen of Beauty is not here . ”</l>
     <l n="210">Then most of these were mute , some anger 'd , one</l>
     <l n="211">Murmuring “ All courtesy is dead , ” and one ,</l>
     <l n="212">“ The glory of our Round Table is no more . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="213">Then fell thick rain , plume droopt and mantle clung ,</l>
     <l n="214">And pettish cries awoke , and the wan day</l>
     <l n="215">Went glooming down in wet and weariness :</l>
     <l n="216">But under her black brows a swarthy dame</l>
     <l n="217">Laught shrilly , crying “ Praise the patient saints ,</l>
     <l n="218">Our one white day of Innocence hath past ,</l>
     <l n="219">Tho ’ somewhat draggled at the skirt . So be it .</l>
     <l n="220">The snowdrop only , flow'ring thro ’ the year ,</l>
     <l n="221">Would make the world as blank as wintertide .</l>
     <l n="222">Come — let us comfort their sad eyes , our Queen 's</l>
     <l n="223">And Lancelot 's , at this night 's solemnity</l>
     <l n="224">With all the kindlier colors of the field . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="225">So dame and damsel glitter 'd at the feast</l>
     <l n="226">Variously gay : for he that tells the tale</l>
     <l n="227">Liken 'd them , saying “ as when an hour of cold</l>
     <l n="228">Falls on the mountain in midsummer snows ,</l>
     <l n="229">And all the purple slopes of mountain flowers</l>
     <l n="230">Pass under white , till the warm hour returns</l>
     <l n="231">With veer of wind , and all are flowers again ; ”</l>
     <l n="232">So dame and damsel cast the simple white ,</l>
     <l n="233">And glowing in all colors , the live grass ,</l>
     <l n="234">Rose-campion , bluebell , kingcup , poppy , glanced</l>
     <l n="235">About the revels , and with mirth so loud</l>
     <l n="236">Beyond all use , that , half-amazed , the Queen ,</l>
     <l n="237">And wroth at Tristram and the lawless jousts ,</l>
     <l n="238">Brake up their sports , then slowly to her bower</l>
     <l n="239">Parted , and in her bosom pain was lord .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="19">
     <l n="240">And little Dagonet on the morrow morn ,</l>
