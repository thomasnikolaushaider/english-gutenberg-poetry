       <l n="2">Come hither , lads , and hearken , for a tale there is to tell ,</l>
       <l n="3">Of the wonderful days a-coming , when all shall be better than well .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="4">And the tale shall be told of a country , a land in the midst of the sea ,</l>
       <l n="5">And folk shall call it England in the days that are going to be .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="6">There more than one in a thousand in the days that are yet to come</l>
       <l n="7">Shall have some hope of the morrow , some joy of the ancient home .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="8">For then — laugh not , but listen to this strange tale of mine -</l>
       <l n="9">All folk that are in England shall be better lodged than swine .</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>Then a man shall work and bethink him , and rejoice in the deeds of his hand , Nor yet come home in the even too faint and weary to stand .</p>
     <lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">Men in that time a-coming shall work and have no fear</l>
       <l n="2">For to-morrow 's lack of earning and the hunger-wolf anear .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="3">I tell you this for a wonder , that no man then shall be glad</l>
       <l n="4">Of his fellow 's fall and mishap to snatch at the work he had .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="5">For that which the worker winneth shall then be his indeed ,</l>
       <l n="6">Nor shall half be reaped for nothing by him that sowed no seed .</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>O strange new wonderful justice ! But for whom shall we gather the gain ? For ourselves and for each of our fellows , and no hand shall labour in vain .</p>
     <p>Then all Mine and all Thine shall be Ours , and no more shall any man crave For riches that serve for nothing but to fetter a friend for a slave .</p>
     <lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">And what wealth then shall be left us when none shall gather gold</l>
       <l n="2">To buy his friend in the market , and pinch and pine the sold ?</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="3">Nay , what save the lovely city , and the little house on the hill ,</l>
       <l n="4">And the wastes and the woodland beauty , and the happy fields we till ;</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="5">And the homes of ancient stories , the tombs of the mighty dead ;</l>
       <l n="6">And the wise men seeking out marvels , and the poet 's teeming head ;</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="7">And the painter 's hand of wonder ; and the marvellous fiddle-bow ,</l>
       <l n="8">And the banded choirs of music : all those that do and know .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="9">For all these shall be ours and all men 's , nor shall any lack a share</l>
       <l n="10">Of the toil and the gain of living in the days when the world grows fair .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="11">Ah ! such are the days that shall be ! But what are the deeds of to-day ,</l>
       <l n="12">In the days of the years we dwell in , that wear our lives away ?</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="13">Why , then , and for what are we waiting ? There are three words to speak :</l>
       <l n="14">WE WILL IT , and what is the foeman but the dream-strong wakened and weak ?</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="15">O why and for what are we waiting ? While our brothers droop and die ,</l>
       <l n="16">And on every wind of the heavens a wasted life goes by .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="9">
       <l n="17">How long shall they reproach us where crowd on crowd they dwell ,</l>
       <l n="18">Poor ghosts of the wicked city , the gold-crushed hungry hell ?</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="10">
       <l n="19">Through squalid life they laboured , in sordid grief they died ,</l>
       <l n="20">Those sons of a mighty mother , those props of England 's pride .</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>They are gone ; there is none can undo it , nor save our souls from the curse ; But many a million cometh , and shall they be better or worse ?</p>
     <lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">It is we must answer and hasten , and open wide the door</l>
       <l n="2">For the rich man 's hurrying terror , and the slow-foot hope of the poor .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="3">Yea , the voiceless wrath of the wretched , and their unlearned discontent ,</l>
       <l n="4">We must give it voice and wisdom till the waiting-tide be spent .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="5">Come , then , since all things call us , the living and the dead ,</l>
       <l n="6">And o'er the weltering tangle a glimmering light is shed .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="7">Come , then , let us cast off fooling , and put by ease and rest ,</l>
       <l n="8">For the CAUSE alone is worthy till the good days bring the best .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="9">Come , join in the only battle wherein no man can fail ,</l>
       <l n="10">Where whoso fadeth and dieth , yet his deed shall still prevail .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="11">Ah ! come , cast off all fooling , for this , at least , we know :</l>
       <l n="12">That the Dawn and the Day is coming , and forth the Banners go .</l>

       <l n="5">When Earth was younger mid toil and hunger ,</l>

       <l n="78">the Socialist League in 1885 . If any reader has access to the original</l>
