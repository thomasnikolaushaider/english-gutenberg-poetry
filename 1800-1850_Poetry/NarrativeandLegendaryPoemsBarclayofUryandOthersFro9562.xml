   <head>BARCLAY OF URY .</head>
   <p>Among the earliest converts to the doctrines of Friends in Scotland was Barclay of Ury , an old and distinguished soldier , who had fought under Gustavus Adolphus , in Germany . As a Quaker , he became the object of persecution and abuse at the hands of the magistrates and the populace . None bore the indignities of the mob with greater patience and nobleness of soul than this once proud gentleman and soldier . One of his friends , on an occasion of uncommon rudeness , lamented that he should be treated so harshly in his old age who had been so honored before . “ I find more satisfaction , ” said Barclay , “ as well as honor , in being thus insulted for my religious principles , than when , a few years ago , it was usual for the magistrates , as I passed the city of Aberdeen , to meet me on the road and conduct me to public entertainment in their hall , and then escort me out again , to gain my favor . ”</p>

     <l n="1">Up the streets of Aberdeen ,</l>
     <l n="2">By the kirk and college green ,</l>
     <l n="3">Rode the Laird of Ury ;</l>
     <l n="4">Close behind him , close beside ,</l>
     <l n="5">Foul of mouth and evil-eyed ,</l>
     <l n="6">Pressed the mob in fury .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="7">Flouted him the drunken churl ,</l>
     <l n="8">Jeered at him the serving-girl ,</l>
     <l n="9">Prompt to please her master ;</l>
     <l n="10">And the begging carlin , late</l>
     <l n="11">Fed and clothed at Ury 's gate ,</l>
     <l n="12">Cursed him as he passed her .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="13">Yet , with calm and stately mien ,</l>
     <l n="14">Up the streets of Aberdeen</l>
     <l n="15">Came he slowly riding ;</l>
     <l n="16">And , to all he saw and heard ,</l>
     <l n="17">Answering not with bitter word ,</l>
     <l n="18">Turning not for chiding .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="19">Came a troop with broadswords swinging ,</l>
     <l n="20">Bits and bridles sharply ringing ,</l>
     <l n="21">Loose and free and froward ;</l>
     <l n="22">Quoth the foremost , “ Ride him down !</l>
     <l n="23">Push him ! prick him ! through the town</l>
     <l n="24">Drive the Quaker coward ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="25">But from out the thickening crowd</l>
     <l n="26">Cried a sudden voice and loud</l>
     <l n="27">“ Barclay ! Ho ! a Barclay ! ”</l>
     <l n="28">And the old man at his side</l>
     <l n="29">Saw a comrade , battle tried ,</l>
     <l n="30">Scarred and sunburned darkly ;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="31">Who with ready weapon bare ,</l>
     <l n="32">Fronting to the troopers there ,</l>
     <l n="33">Cried aloud : “ God save us ,</l>
     <l n="34">Call ye coward him who stood</l>
     <l n="35">Ankle deep in Lutzen 's blood ,</l>
     <l n="36">With the brave Gustavus ? ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="37">“ Nay , I do not need thy sword ,</l>
     <l n="38">Comrade mine , ” said Ury 's lord ;</l>

     <l n="44">Proved on many a field of death ,</l>
     <l n="45">Not by me are needed . ”</l>
     <l n="46">Marvelled much that henchman bold ,</l>
     <l n="47">That his laird , so stout of old ,</l>
     <l n="48">Now so meekly pleaded .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="49">“ Woe 's the day ! ” he sadly said ,</l>
     <l n="50">With a slowly shaking head ,</l>
     <l n="51">And a look of pity ;</l>
     <l n="52">“ Ury 's honest lord reviled ,</l>
     <l n="53">Mock of knave and sport of child ,</l>
     <l n="54">In his own good city .</l>

     <l n="55">“ Speak the word , and , master mine ,</l>

     <l n="57">And his Walloon lancers ,</l>
     <l n="58">Smiting through their midst we 'll teach</l>
     <l n="59">Civil look and decent speech</l>
     <l n="60">To these boyish prancers ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="61">“ Marvel not , mine ancient friend ,</l>
     <l n="62">Like beginning , like the end : ”</l>
     <l n="63">Quoth the Laird of Ury ;</l>
     <l n="64">“ Is the sinful servant more</l>
     <l n="65">Than his gracious Lord who bore</l>
     <l n="66">Bonds and stripes in Jewry ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="67">“ Give me joy that in His name</l>

     <l n="73">“ Happier I , with loss of all ,</l>
     <l n="74">Hunted , outlawed , held in thrall ,</l>
     <l n="75">With few friends to greet me ,</l>
     <l n="76">Than when reeve and squire were seen ,</l>
     <l n="77">Riding out from Aberdeen ,</l>
     <l n="78">With bared heads to meet me .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="79">“ When each goodwife , o'er and o'er ,</l>

     <l n="82">Through her casement glancing down ,</l>
     <l n="83">Smiled on him who bore renown</l>
     <l n="84">From red fields of slaughter .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="85">“ Hard to feel the stranger 's scoff ,</l>

     <l n="88">But the Lord His own rewards ,</l>
     <l n="89">And His love with theirs accords ,</l>
     <l n="90">Warm and fresh and living .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="16">

   <p>THE ANGELS OF BUENA VISTA .</p>
   <p>A letter-writer from Mexico during the Mexican war , when detailing some of the incidents at the terrible fight of Buena Vista , mentioned that Mexican women were seen hovering near the field of death , for the purpose of giving aid and succor to the wounded . One poor woman was found surrounded by the maimed and suffering of both armies , ministering to the wants of Americans as well as Mexicans , with impartial tenderness .</p>
   <p>SPEAK and tell us , our Ximena , looking northward far away , O'er the camp of the invaders , o'er the Mexican array , Who is losing ? who is winning ? are they far or come they near ? Look abroad , and tell us , sister , whither rolls the storm we hear . Down the hills of Angostura still the storm of battle rolls ; Blood is flowing , men are dying ; God have mercy on their souls ! “ Who is losing ? who is winning ? ” Over hill and over plain , I see but smoke of cannon clouding through the mountain rain . ”</p>
   <p>Holy Mother ! keep our brothers ! Look , Ximena , look once more . “ Still I see the fearful whirlwind rolling darkly as before , Bearing on , in strange confusion , friend and foeman , foot and horse , Like some wild and troubled torrent sweeping down its mountain course . ”</p>
   <p>Look forth once more , Ximena ! “ Ah ! the smoke has rolled away ; And I see the Northern rifles gleaming down the ranks of gray . Hark ! that sudden blast of bugles ! there the troop of Minon wheels ; There the Northern horses thunder , with the cannon at their heels .</p>
   <p>“ Jesu , pity I how it thickens I now retreat and now advance ! Bight against the blazing cannon shivers Puebla 's charging lance ! Down they go , the brave young riders ; horse and foot together fall ; Like a ploughshare in the fallow , through them ploughs the Northern ball . ”</p>
   <p>Nearer came the storm and nearer , rolling fast and frightful on ! Speak , Ximena , speak and tell us , who has lost , and who has won ? Alas ! alas ! I know not ; friend and foe together fall , O'er the dying rush the living : pray , my sisters , for them all !</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Lo ! the wind the smoke is lifting . Blessed</l>
     <l n="2">Mother , save my brain !</l>
     <l n="3">I can see the wounded crawling slowly out from</l>
     <l n="4">heaps of slain .</l>
     <l n="5">Now they stagger , blind and bleeding ; now they</l>
     <l n="6">fall , and strive to rise ;</l>
     <l n="7">Hasten , sisters , haste and save them , lest they die</l>
     <l n="8">before our eyes !</l>
   </lg>
   <p>“ O my hearts love ! O my dear one ! lay thy poor head on my knee ; Dost thou know the lips that kiss thee ? Canst thou hear me ? canst thou see ? O my husband , brave and gentle ! O my Bernal , look once more On the blessed cross before thee ! Mercy ! all is o'er ! ”</p>
   <p>Dry thy tears , my poor Ximena ; lay thy dear one down to rest ; Let his hands be meekly folded , lay the cross upon his breast ; Let his dirge be sung hereafter , and his funeral masses said ; To-day , thou poor bereaved one , the living ask thy aid .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Close beside her , faintly moaning , fair and young ,</l>
     <l n="2">a soldier lay ,</l>
     <l n="3">Torn with shot and pierced with lances , bleeding</l>
     <l n="4">slow his life away ;</l>
     <l n="5">But , as tenderly before him the lorn Ximena knelt ,</l>
     <l n="6">She saw the Northern eagle shining on his pistol-</l>
     <l n="7">belt .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>With a stifled cry of horror straight she turned away her head ; With a sad and bitter feeling looked she back upon her dead ; But she heard the youth 's low moaning , and his struggling breath of pain , And she raised the cooling water to his parching lips again .</p>
   <p>Whispered low the dying soldier , pressed her hand and faintly smiled ; Was that pitying face his mother 's ? did she watch beside her child ? All his stranger words with meaning her woman 's heart supplied ; With her kiss upon his forehead , “ Mother ! ” murmured he , and died !</p>
   <p>“ A bitter curse upon them , poor boy , who led thee forth , From some gentle , sad-eyed mother , weeping , lonely , in the North ! ” Spake the mournful Mexic woman , as she laid him with her dead , And turned to soothe the living , and bind the wounds which bled .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Look forth once more , Ximena ! ” Like a cloud</l>
     <l n="2">before the wind</l>
     <l n="3">Rolls the battle down the mountains , leaving blood</l>
     <l n="4">and death behind ;</l>
     <l n="5">Ah ! they plead in vain for mercy ; in the dust the</l>
     <l n="6">wounded strive ;</l>
     <l n="7">“ Hide your faces , holy angels ! O thou Christ of</l>
     <l n="8">God , forgive ! ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Sink , O Night , among thy mountains ! let the cool , gray shadows fall ; Dying brothers , fighting demons , drop thy curtain over all ! Through the thickening winter twilight , wide apart the battle rolled , In its sheath the sabre rested , and the cannon 's lips grew cold .</p>
   <p>But the noble Mexic women still their holy task pursued , Through that long , dark night of sorrow , worn and faint and lacking food . Over weak and suffering brothers , with a tender care they hung , And the dying foeman blessed them in a strange and Northern tongue .</p>
   <p>Not wholly lost , O Father ! is this evil world of ours ; Upward , through its blood and ashes , spring afresh the Eden flowers ; From its smoking hell of battle , Love and Pity send their prayer , And still thy white-winged angels hover dimly in our air ! 1847 .</p>

    <head>THE LEGEND OF ST. MARK .</head>
    <head>“ This legend [ to which my attention was called by my friend Charles Sumner ] , is the subject of a celebrated picture by Tintoretto , of which Mr. Rogers possesses the original sketch . The slave lies on the ground , amid a crowd of spectators , who look on , animated by all the various emotions of sympathy , rage , terror ; a woman , in front , with a child in her arms , has always been admired for the lifelike vivacity of her attitude and expression . The executioner holds up the broken implements ; St. Mark , with a headlong movement , seems to rush down from heaven in haste to save his worshipper . The dramatic grouping in this picture is wonderful ; the coloring , in its gorgeous depth and harmony , is , in Mr. Rogers 's sketch , finer than in the picture . ” — MRS. JAMESON 'S Sacred and Legendary Art , I . 154 .</head>

    <head>KATHLEEN .</head>
    <head>This ballad was originally published in my prose work , Leaves from Margaret Smith 's Journal , as the song of a wandering Milesian schoolmaster . In the seventeenth century , slavery in the New World was by no means confined to the natives of Africa . Political offenders and criminals were transported by the British government to the plantations of Barbadoes and Virginia , where they were sold like cattle in the market . Kidnapping of free and innocent white persons was practised to a considerable extent in the seaports of the United Kingdom .</head>

   <p>THE CHAPEL OF THE HERMITS .</p>
   <p>The incident upon which this poem is based is related in a note to Bernardin Henri Saint Pierre 's Etudes de la Nature . “ We arrived at the habitation of the Hermits a little before they sat down to their table , and while they were still at church . J. J. Rousseau proposed to me to offer up our devotions . The hermits were reciting the Litanies of Providence , which are remarkably beautiful . After we had addressed our prayers to God , and the hermits were proceeding to the refectory , Rousseau said to me , with his heart overflowing , ‘ At this moment I experience what is said in the gospel : Where two or three are gathered together in my name , there am I in the midst of them . There is here a feeling of peace and happiness which penetrates the soul . ’ I said , ‘ If Finelon had lived , you would have been a Catholic . ’ He exclaimed , with tears in his eyes , ‘ Oh , if Finelon were alive , I would struggle to get into his service , even as a lackey ! ’ ” In my sketch of Saint Pierre , it will be seen that I have somewhat antedated the period of his old age . At that time he was not probably more than fifty . In describing him , I have by no means exaggerated his own history of his mental condition at the period of the story . In the fragmentary Sequel to his Studies of Nature , he thus speaks of himself : “ The ingratitude of those of whom I had deserved kindness , unexpected family misfortunes , the total loss of my small patrimony through enterprises solely undertaken for the benefit of my country , the debts under which I lay oppressed , the blasting of all my hopes ,— these combined calamities made dreadful inroads upon my health and reason . . . . I found it impossible to continue in a room where there was company , especially if the doors were shut . I could not even cross an alley in a public garden , if several persons had got together in it . When alone , my malady subsided . I felt myself likewise at ease in places where I saw children only . At the sight of any one walking up to the place where I was , I felt my whole frame agitated , and retired . I often said to myself , ‘ My sole study has been to merit well of mankind ; why do I fear them ? ’ ”</p>
   <p>He attributes his improved health of mind and body to the counsels of his friend , J. J. Rousseau . “ I renounced , ” says he , “ my books . I threw my eyes upon the works of nature , which spake to all my senses a language which neither time nor nations have it in their power to alter . Thenceforth my histories and my journals were the herbage of the fields and meadows . My thoughts did not go forth painfully after them , as in the case of human systems ; but their thoughts , under a thousand engaging forms , quietly sought me . In these I studied , without effort , the laws of that Universal Wisdom which had surrounded me from the cradle , but on which heretofore I had bestowed little attention . ”</p>
   <p>Speaking of Rousseau , he says : “ I derived inexpressible satisfaction from his society . What I prized still more than his genius was his probity . He was one of the few literary characters , tried in the furnace of affliction , to whom you could , with perfect security , confide your most secret thoughts . . . . Even when he deviated , and became the victim of himself or of others , he could forget his own misery in devotion to the welfare of mankind . He was uniformly the advocate of the miserable . There might be inscribed on his tomb these affecting words from that Book of which he carried always about him some select passages , during the last years of his life : ‘ His sins , which are many , are forgiven , for he loved much . ’ ”</p>

     <l n="1">TAULER , the preacher , walked , one autumn day ,</l>
     <l n="2">Without the walls of Strasburg , by the Rhine ,</l>
     <l n="3">Pondering the solemn Miracle of Life ;</l>
     <l n="4">As one who , wandering in a starless night ,</l>
     <l n="5">Feels momently the jar of unseen waves ,</l>
     <l n="6">And hears the thunder of an unknown sea ,</l>
     <l n="7">Breaking along an unimagined shore .</l>

     <l n="8">And as he walked he prayed . Even the same</l>
     <l n="9">Old prayer with which , for half a score of years ,</l>
     <l n="10">Morning , and noon , and evening , lip and heart</l>
     <l n="11">Had groaned : “ Have pity upon me , Lord !</l>

     <l n="14">Then , as he mused , he heard along his path</l>

     <l n="40">Silently wondering , for a little space ,</l>

     <l n="43">Which long has followed , whispering through the dark</l>
     <l n="44">Strange terrors , drags it , shrieking , into light</l>
     <l n="45">“ What if God 's will consign thee hence to Hell ? ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="46">“ Then , ” said the stranger , cheerily , “ be it so .</l>

     <l n="48">I cannot lose the presence of the Lord .</l>
     <l n="49">One arm , Humility , takes hold upon</l>
     <l n="50">His dear Humanity ; the other , Love ,</l>
     <l n="51">Clasps his Divinity . So where I go</l>
     <l n="52">He goes ; and better fire-walled Hell with Him</l>
     <l n="53">Than golden-gated Paradise without . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="54">Tears sprang in Tauler 's eyes . A sudden light ,</l>
     <l n="55">Like the first ray which fell on chaos , clove</l>
     <l n="56">Apart the shadow wherein he had walked</l>
     <l n="57">Darkly at noon . And , as the strange old man</l>
     <l n="58">Went his slow way , until his silver hair</l>
     <l n="59">Set like the white moon where the hills of vine</l>
     <l n="60">Slope to the Rhine , he bowed his head and said</l>
     <l n="61">“ My prayer is answered . God hath sent the man</l>
     <l n="62">Long sought , to teach me , by his simple trust ,</l>
     <l n="63">Wisdom the weary schoolmen never knew . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="64">So , entering with a changed and cheerful step</l>
     <l n="65">The city gates , he saw , far down the street ,</l>
     <l n="66">A mighty shadow break the light of noon ,</l>
     <l n="67">Which tracing backward till its airy lines</l>
     <l n="68">Hardened to stony plinths , he raised his eyes</l>
     <l n="69">O'er broad facade and lofty pediment ,</l>
     <l n="70">O'er architrave and frieze and sainted niche ,</l>
     <l n="71">Up the stone lace-work chiselled by the wise</l>
     <l n="72">Erwin of Steinbach , dizzily up to where</l>
     <l n="73">In the noon-brightness the great Minster 's tower ,</l>
     <l n="74">Jewelled with sunbeams on its mural crown ,</l>
     <l n="75">Rose like a visible prayer . “ Behold ! ” he said ,</l>
     <l n="76">“ The stranger 's faith made plain before mine eyes .</l>
     <l n="77">As yonder tower outstretches to the earth</l>
     <l n="78">The dark triangle of its shade alone</l>
     <l n="79">When the clear day is shining on its top ,</l>
     <l n="80">So , darkness in the pathway of Man 's life</l>
     <l n="81">Is but the shadow of God 's providence ,</l>
     <l n="82">By the great Sun of Wisdom cast thereon ;</l>

    <head>MAUD MULLER .</head>
    <head>The recollection of some descendants of a Hessian deserter in the Revolutionary war bearing the name of Muller doubtless suggested the somewhat infelicitous title of a New England idyl . The poem had no real foundation in fact , though a hint of it may have been found in recalling an incident , trivial in itself , of a journey on the picturesque Maine seaboard with my sister some years before it was written . We had stopped to rest our tired horse under the shade of an apple-tree , and refresh him with water from a little brook which rippled through the stone wall across the road . A very beautiful young girl in scantest summer attire was at work in the hay-field , and as we talked with her we noticed that she strove to hide her bare feet by raking hay over them , blushing as she did so , through the tan of her cheek and neck .</head>

   <p>MARY GARVIN . FROM the heart of Waumbek Methna , from the lake that never fails , Falls the Saco in the green lap of Conway 's intervales ; There , in wild and virgin freshness , its waters foam and flow , As when Darby Field first saw them , two hundred years ago .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">But , vexed in all its seaward course with bridges ,</l>
     <l n="2">dams , and mills ,</l>
     <l n="3">How changed is Saco 's stream , how lost its freedom</l>
     <l n="4">of the hills ,</l>
     <l n="5">Since travelled Jocelyn , factor Vines , and stately</l>

     <l n="8">of the loon !</l>
   </lg>
   <p>With smoking axle hot with speed , with steeds of fire and steam , Wide-waked To-day leaves Yesterday behind him like a dream . Still , from the hurrying train of Life , fly backward far and fast The milestones of the fathers , the landmarks of the past .</p>
   <p>But human hearts remain unchanged : the sorrow and the sin , The loves and hopes and fears of old , are to our own akin ;</p>
   <p>And if , in tales our fathers told , the songs our mothers sung , Tradition wears a snowy beard , Romance is always young .</p>

   <p>The evening gun had sounded from gray Fort Mary 's walls ; Through the forest , like a wild beast , roared and plunged the Saco 's ’ falls .</p>
   <p>And westward on the sea-wind , that damp and gusty grew , Over cedars darkening inland the smokes of Spurwink blew .</p>
   <p>On the hearth of Farmer Garvin , blazed the crackling walnut log ; Right and left sat dame and goodman , and between them lay the dog ,</p>
   <p>Head on paws , and tail slow wagging , and beside him on her mat , Sitting drowsy in the firelight , winked and purred the mottled cat .</p>
   <p>“ Twenty years ! ” said Goodman Garvin , speaking sadly , under breath , And his gray head slowly shaking , as one who speaks of death .</p>
   <p>The goodwife dropped her needles : “ It is twenty years to-day , Since the Indians fell on Saco , and stole our child away . ”</p>
   <p>Then they sank into the silence , for each knew the other 's thought , Of a great and common sorrow , and words were , needed not .</p>
   <p>“ Who knocks ? ” cried Goodman Garvin . The door was open thrown ; On two strangers , man and maiden , cloaked and furred , the fire-light shone .</p>
   <p>One with courteous gesture lifted the bear-skin from his head ; “ Lives here Elkanah Garvin ? ” “ I am he , ” the goodman said .</p>
   <p>“ Sit ye down , and dry and warm ye , for the night is chill with rain . ” And the goodwife drew the settle , and stirred the fire amain .</p>
   <p>The maid unclasped her cloak-hood , the firelight glistened fair In her large , moist eyes , and over soft folds of dark brown hair .</p>
   <p>Dame Garvin looked upon her : “ It is Mary 's self I see ! ” “ Dear heart ! ” she cried , “ now tell me , has my child come back to me ? ”</p>
   <p>“ My name indeed is Mary , ” said the stranger sobbing wild ; “ Will you be to me a mother ? I am Mary Garvin 's child ! ”</p>
   <p>“ She sleeps by wooded Simcoe , but on her dying day She bade my father take me to her kinsfolk far away .</p>
   <p>“ And when the priest besought her to do me no such wrong , She said , ‘ May God forgive me ! I have closed my heart too long . ’</p>
   <p>“ ‘ When I hid me from my father , and shut out my mother 's call , I sinned against those dear ones , and the Father of us all .</p>
   <p>“ ‘ Christ 's love rebukes no home-love , breaks no tie of kin apart ; Better heresy in doctrine , than heresy of heart .</p>
   <p>“ ‘ Tell me not the Church must censure : she who wept the Cross beside Never made her own flesh strangers , nor the claims of blood denied ;</p>
   <p>“ ‘ And if she who wronged her parents , with her child atones to them , Earthly daughter , Heavenly Mother ! thou at least wilt not condemn ! ’</p>
   <p>“ So , upon her death-bed lying , my blessed mother spake ; As we come to do her bidding , So receive us for her sake . ”</p>
   <p>“ God be praised ! ” said Goodwife Garvin , “ He taketh , and He gives ; He woundeth , but He healeth ; in her child our daughter lives ! ”</p>
   <p>“ Amen ! ” the old man answered , as he brushed a tear away , And , kneeling by his hearthstone , said , with reverence , “ Let us pray . ”</p>
   <p>All its Oriental symbols , and its Hebrew pararphrase , Warm with earnest life and feeling , rose his prayer of love and praise .</p>
   <p>But he started at beholding , as he rose from off his knee , The stranger cross his forehead with the sign of Papistrie .</p>
   <p>“ What is this ? ” cried Farmer Garvin . “ Is an English Christian 's home A chapel or a mass-house , that you make the sign of Rome ? ”</p>
   <p>Then the young girl knelt beside him , kissed his trembling hand , and cried : Oh , forbear to chide my father ; in that faith my mother died !</p>
   <p>“ On her wooden cross at Simcoe the dews and sunshine fall , As they fall on Spurwink 's graveyard ; and the dear God watches all ! ”</p>
   <p>The old man stroked the fair head that rested on his knee ; “ Your words , dear child , ” he answered , “ are God 's rebuke to me .</p>
   <p>“ Creed and rite perchance may differ , yet our faith and hope be one . Let me be your father 's father , let him be to me a son . ”</p>
   <p>When the horn , on Sabbath morning , through the still and frosty air , From Spurwink , Pool , and Black Point , called to sermon and to prayer ,</p>
   <p>To the goodly house of worship , where , in order due and fit , As by public vote directed , classed and ranked the people sit ;</p>
   <p>Mistress first and goodwife after , clerkly squire before the clown , “ From the brave coat , lace-embroidered , to the gray frock , shading down ; ”</p>
   <p>From the pulpit read the preacher , “ Goodman Garvin and his wife Fain would thank the Lord , whose kindness has followed them through life ,</p>
   <p>“ For the great and crowning mercy , that their daughter , from the wild , Where she rests ( they hope in God 's peace ) , has sent to them her child ;</p>
   <p>“ And the prayers of all God 's people they ask , that they may prove Not unworthy , through their weakness , of such special proof of love . ”</p>
   <p>As the preacher prayed , uprising , the aged couple stood , And the fair Canadian also , in her modest maiden - hood .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Thought the elders , grave and doubting , “ She is</l>
     <l n="2">Papist born and bred ; ”</l>
     <l n="3">Thought the young men , “ ‘ T is an angel in Mary</l>
     <l n="4">Garvin 's stead ! ”</l>

   <p>THE GARRISON OF CAPE ANN .</p>
   <p>FROM the hills of home forth looking , far beneath the tent-like span Of the sky , I see the white gleam of the headland of Cape Ann . Well I know its coves and beaches to the ebb-tide glimmering down , And the white-walled hamlet children of its ancient fishing town .</p>
   <p>Long has passed the summer morning , and its memory waxes old , When along yon breezy headlands with a pleasant friend I strolled . Ah ! the autumn sun is shining , and the ocean wind blows cool , And the golden-rod and aster bloom around thy grave , Rantoul !</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">With the memory of that morning by the summer</l>
     <l n="2">sea I blend</l>
     <l n="3">A wild and wondrous story , by the younger Mather</l>
     <l n="4">penned ,</l>
     <l n="5">In that quaint Magnalia Christi , with all strange</l>
     <l n="6">and marvellous things ,</l>
     <l n="7">Heaped up huge and undigested , like the chaos</l>
     <l n="8">Ovid sings .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Dear to me these far , faint glimpses of the dual life of old , Inward , grand with awe and reverence ; outward , mean and coarse and cold ; Gleams of mystic beauty playing over dull and vulgar clay , Golden-threaded fancies weaving in a web of hodden gray .</p>
   <p>The great eventful Present hides the Past ; but through the din Of its loud life hints and echoes from the life behind steal in ; And the lore of homeland fireside , and the legendary rhyme , Make the task of duty lighter which the true man owes his time .</p>
   <p>So , with something of the feeling which the Covenanter knew , When with pious chisel wandering Scotland 's moorland graveyards through , From the graves of old traditions I part the black - berry-vines , Wipe the moss from off the headstones , and retouch the faded lines .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Where the sea-waves back and forward , hoarse</l>
     <l n="2">with rolling pebbles , ran ,</l>
     <l n="3">The garrison-house stood watching on the gray</l>
     <l n="4">rocks of Cape Ann ;</l>
     <l n="5">On its windy site uplifting gabled roof and palisade ,</l>
     <l n="6">And rough walls of unhewn timber with the moonlight</l>
     <l n="7">overlaid .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>On his slow round walked the sentry , south and eastward looking forth O'er a rude and broken coast-line , white with breakers stretching north ,— Wood and rock and gleaming sand-drift , jagged capes , with bush and tree , Leaning inland from the smiting of the wild and gusty sea .</p>
   <p>Before the deep-mouthed chimney , dimly lit by dying brands , Twenty soldiers sat and waited , with their muskets in their hands ; On the rough-hewn oaken table the venison haunch was shared , And the pewter tankard circled slowly round from beard to beard .</p>
   <p>Long they sat and talked together ,— talked of wizards Satan-sold ; Of all ghostly sights and noises ,— signs and wonders manifold ; Of the spectre-ship of Salem , with the dead men in her shrouds , Sailing sheer above the water , in the loom of morning clouds ;</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Of the marvellous valley hidden in the depths of</l>
     <l n="2">Gloucester woods ,</l>
     <l n="3">Full of plants that love the summer ,— blooms of</l>
     <l n="4">warmer latitudes ;</l>
     <l n="5">Where the Arctic birch is braided by the tropic 's</l>
     <l n="6">flowery vines ,</l>
     <l n="7">And the white magnolia-blossoms star the twilight</l>
     <l n="8">of the pines !</l>
   </lg>
   <p>But their voices sank yet lower , sank to husky tones of fear , As they spake of present tokens of the powers of evil near ; Of a spectral host , defying stroke of steel and aim of gun ; Never yet was ball to slay them in the mould of mortals run .</p>
   <p>Thrice , with plumes and flowing scalp-locks , from the midnight wood they came ,— Thrice around the block-house marching , met , unharmed , its volleyed flame ; Then , with mocking laugh and gesture , sunk in earth or lost in air , All the ghostly wonder vanished , and the moonlit sands lay bare .</p>
   <p>Midnight came ; from out the forest moved a dusky mass that soon Grew to warriors , plumed and painted , grimly marching in the moon . “ Ghosts or witches , ” said the captain , “ thus I foil the Evil One ! ” And he rammed a silver button , from his doublet , down his gun .</p>
   <p>Once again the spectral horror moved the guarded wall about ; Once again the levelled muskets through the palisades flashed out , With that deadly aim the squirrel on his tree-top might not shun , Nor the beach-bird seaward flying with his slant wing to the sun .</p>
   <p>Like the idle rain of summer sped the harmless shower of lead . With a laugh of fierce derision , once again the phantoms fled ; Once again , without a shadow on the sands the moonlight lay , And the white smoke curling through it drifted slowly down the bay !</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ God preserve us ! ” said the captain ; “ never</l>
     <l n="2">mortal foes were there ;</l>
     <l n="3">They have vanished with their leader , Prince and</l>
     <l n="4">Power of the air !</l>
     <l n="5">Lay aside your useless weapons ; skill and prowess</l>
     <l n="6">naught avail ;</l>
     <l n="7">They who do the Devil 's service wear their master 's</l>
     <l n="8">coat of mail ! ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>So the night grew near to cock-crow , when again a warning call Roused the score of weary soldiers watching round the dusky hall And they looked to flint and priming , and they longed for break of day ; But the captain closed his Bible : “ Let us cease from man , and pray ! ”</p>
   <p>To the men who went before us , all the unseen powers seemed near , And their steadfast strength of courage struck its roots in holy fear . Every hand forsook the musket , every head was bowed and bare , Every stout knee pressed the flag-stones , as the captain led in prayer .</p>
   <p>Ceased thereat the mystic marching of the spectres round the wall , But a sound abhorred , unearthly , smote the ears and hearts of all ,— Howls of rage and shrieks of anguish ! Never after mortal man Saw the ghostly leaguers marching round the block-house of Cape Ann .</p>
   <p>So to us who walk in summer through the cool and sea-blown town , From the childhood of its people comes the solemn legend down . Not in vain the ancient fiction , in whose moral lives the youth And the fitness and the freshness of an undecaying truth .</p>
   <p>Soon or late to all our dwellings come the spectres of the mind , Doubts and fears and dread forebodings , in the darkness undefined ; Round us throng the grim projections of the heart and of the brain , And our pride of strength is weakness , and the cunning hand is vain .</p>
   <p>In the dark we cry like children ; and no answer from on high Breaks the crystal spheres of silence , and no white wings downward fly ; But the heavenly help we pray for comes to faith , and not to sight , And our prayers themselves drive backward all the spirits of the night ! 1857 .</p>

   <p>SKIPPER IRESON 'S RIDE .</p>
   <p>In the valuable and carefully prepared History of Marblehead , published in 1879 by Samuel Roads , Jr ., it is stated that the crew of Captain Ireson , rather than himself , were responsible for the abandonment of the disabled vessel . To screen themselves they charged their captain with the crime . In view of this the writer of the ballad addressed the following letter to the historian :—</p>
   <p>OAK KNOLL , DANVERS , 5 mo . 18 , 1880 . MY DEAR FRIEND : I heartily thank thee for a copy of thy History of Marblehead . I have read it with great interest and think good use has been made of the abundant material . No town in Essex County has a record more honorable than Marblehead ; no one has done more to develop the industrial interests of our New England seaboard , and certainly none have given such evidence of self-sacrificing patriotism . I am glad the story of it has been at last told , and told so well . I have now no doubt that thy version of Skipper Ireson 's ride is the correct one . My verse was founded solely on a fragment of rhyme which I heard from one of my early schoolmates , a native of Marblehead . I supposed the story to which it referred dated back at least a century . I knew nothing of the participators , and the narrative of the ballad was pure fancy . I am glad for the sake of truth and justice that the real facts are given in thy book . I certainly would not knowingly do injustice to any one , dead or living .</p>
   <p>I am very truly thy friend , JOHN G. WHITTIER .</p>

    <head>THE SWAN SONG OF PARSON AVERY .</head>
    <head>In Young 's Chronicles of Massachusetts Bay front 1623 to 1636 may be found Anthony Thacher 's Narrative of his Shipwreck . Thacher was Avery 's companion and survived to tell the tale . Mather 's Magnalia , III . 2 , gives further Particulars of Parson Avery 's End , and suggests the title of the poem .</head>
     <l n="1">WHEN the reaper 's task was ended , and the</l>
     <l n="2">summer wearing late ,</l>
     <l n="3">Parson Avery sailed from Newbury , with his wife</l>
     <l n="4">and children eight ,</l>
     <l n="5">Dropping down the river-harbor in the shallop</l>
     <l n="6">“ Watch and Wait . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Pleasantly lay the clearings in the mellow summer - morn , With the newly planted orchards dropping their fruits first-born , And the home-roofs like brown islands amid a sea of corn .</p>
   <p>Broad meadows reached out ‘ seaward the tided creeks between , And hills rolled wave-like inland , with oaks and walnuts green ;— A fairer home , a — goodlier land , his eyes had never seen .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Yet away sailed Parson Avery , away where duty led ,</l>
     <l n="2">And the voice of God seemed calling , to break the</l>
     <l n="3">living bread</l>
     <l n="4">To the souls of fishers starving on the rocks of</l>
     <l n="5">Marblehead .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>All day they sailed : at nightfall the pleasant land - breeze died , The blackening sky , at midnight , its starry lights denied , And far and low the thunder of tempest prophesied .</p>
   <p>Blotted out were all the coast-lines , gone were rock , and wood , and sand ; Grimly anxious stood the skipper with the rudder in his hand , And questioned of the darkness what was sea and what was land .</p>
   <p>And the preacher heard his dear ones , nestled round him , weeping sore , “ Never heed , my little children ! Christ is walking on before ; To the pleasant land of heaven , where the sea shall be no more . ”</p>
   <p>All at once the great cloud parted , like a curtain drawn aside , To let down the torch of lightning on the terror far and wide ; And the thunder and the whirlwind together smote the tide .</p>
   <p>There was wailing in the shallop , woman 's wail and man 's despair , A crash of breaking timbers on the rocks so sharp and bare , And , through it all , the murmur of Father Avery 's prayer .</p>
   <p>From his struggle in the darkness with the wild waves and the blast , On a rock , where every billow broke above him as it passed , Alone , of all his household , the man of God was cast .</p>
   <p>There a comrade heard him praying , in the pause of wave and wind “ All my own have gone before me , and I linger just behind ; Not for life I ask , but only for the rest Thy ransomed find !</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ In this night of death I challenge the promise of</l>
     <l n="2">Thy word !—</l>
     <l n="3">Let me see the great salvation of which mine ears</l>
     <l n="4">have heard !—</l>
     <l n="5">Let me pass from hence forgiven , through the</l>
     <l n="6">grace of Christ , our Lord !</l>
   </lg>
   <p>“ In the baptism of these waters wash white my every sin , And let me follow up to Thee my household and my kin ! Open the sea-gate of Thy heaven , and let me enter in ! ”</p>
   <p>When the Christian sings his death-song , all the listening heavens draw near , And the angels , leaning over the walls of crystal , hear How the notes so faint and broken swell to music in God 's ear .</p>
   <p>The ear of God was open to His servant 's last request ; As the strong wave swept him downward the sweet hymn upward pressed , And the soul of Father Avery went , singing , to its rest .</p>
   <p>There was wailing on the mainland , from the rocks of Marblehead ; In the stricken church of Newbury the notes of prayer were read ; And long , by board and hearthstone , the living mourned the dead .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">And still the fishers outbound , or scudding from</l>
     <l n="2">the squall ,</l>
     <l n="3">With grave and reverent faces , the ancient tale</l>
     <l n="4">recall ,</l>
     <l n="5">When they see the white waves breaking on the</l>
     <l n="6">Rock of Avery 's Fall !</l>

    <head>THE DOUBLE-HEADED SNAKE OF NEWBURY .</head>
    <head>“ Concerning ye Amphisbaena , as soon as I received your commands , I made diligent inquiry : . . . he assures me yt it had really two heads , one at each end ; two mouths , two stings or tongues . ” — REV . CHRISTOPHER TOPPAN to COTTON MATHER .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">FAR away in the twilight time</l>
     <l n="2">Of every people , in every clime ,</l>
     <l n="3">Dragons and griffins and monsters dire ,</l>
     <l n="4">Born of water , and air , and fire ,</l>
     <l n="5">Or nursed , like the Python , in the mud</l>
     <l n="6">And ooze of the old Deucalion flood ,</l>
     <l n="7">Crawl and wriggle and foam with rage ,</l>
     <l n="8">Through dusk tradition and ballad age .</l>
     <l n="9">So from the childhood of Newbury town</l>
     <l n="10">And its time of fable the tale comes down</l>
     <l n="11">Of a terror which haunted bush and brake ,</l>

     <l n="16">Full of terror and mystery ,</l>
     <l n="17">Half redeemed from the evil hold</l>
     <l n="18">Of the wood so dreary , and dark , and old ,</l>
     <l n="19">Which drank with its lips of leaves the dew</l>
     <l n="20">When Time was young , and the world was new ,</l>
     <l n="21">And wove its shadows with sun and moon ,</l>
     <l n="22">Ere the stones of Cheops were squared and hewn .</l>
     <l n="23">Think of the sea 's dread monotone ,</l>
     <l n="24">Of the mournful wail from the pine-wood blown ,</l>
     <l n="25">Of the strange , vast splendors that lit the North ,</l>
     <l n="26">Of the troubled throes of the quaking earth ,</l>
     <l n="27">And the dismal tales the Indian told ,</l>
     <l n="28">Till the settler 's heart at his hearth grew cold ,</l>
     <l n="29">And he shrank from the tawny wizard boasts ,</l>
     <l n="30">And the hovering shadows seemed full of ghosts ,</l>
     <l n="31">And above , below , and on every side ,</l>
     <l n="32">The fear of his creed seemed verified ;—</l>
     <l n="33">And think , if his lot were now thine own ,</l>
     <l n="34">To grope with terrors nor named nor known ,</l>
     <l n="35">How laxer muscle and weaker nerve</l>
     <l n="36">And a feebler faith thy need might serve ;</l>
     <l n="37">And own to thyself the wonder more</l>
     <l n="38">That the snake had two heads , and not a score !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="39">Whether he lurked in the Oldtown fen</l>

     <l n="42">Or coiled by the Northman 's Written Rock ,</l>
     <l n="43">Nothing on record is left to show ;</l>
     <l n="44">Only the fact that be lived , we know ,</l>
     <l n="45">And left the cast of a double head</l>
     <l n="46">In the scaly mask which he yearly shed .</l>
     <l n="47">For he carried a head where his tail should be ,</l>
     <l n="48">And the two , of course , could never agree ,</l>
     <l n="49">But wriggled about with main and might ,</l>
     <l n="50">Now to the left and now to the right ;</l>

     <l n="56">Shaking their heads in their dreary way ,</l>
     <l n="57">Between the meetings on Sabbath-day !</l>
     <l n="58">How urchins , searching at day 's decline</l>
     <l n="59">The Common Pasture for sheep or kine ,</l>
     <l n="60">The terrible double-ganger heard</l>
     <l n="61">In leafy rustle or whir of bird !</l>
     <l n="62">Think what a zest it gave to the sport ,</l>
     <l n="63">In berry-time , of the younger sort ,</l>
     <l n="64">As over pastures blackberry-twined ,</l>
     <l n="65">Reuben and Dorothy lagged behind ,</l>
     <l n="66">And closer and closer , for fear of harm ,</l>
     <l n="67">The maiden clung to her lover 's arm ;</l>
     <l n="68">And how the spark , who was forced to stay ,</l>
     <l n="69">By his sweetheart 's fears , till the break of day ,</l>
     <l n="70">Thanked the snake for the fond delay .</l>

     <l n="71">Far and wide the tale was told ,</l>
     <l n="72">Like a snowball growing while it rolled .</l>

     <l n="75">To paint the primitive serpent by .</l>
     <l n="76">Cotton Mather came galloping down</l>
     <l n="77">All the way to Newbury town ,</l>

     <l n="79">And his marvellous inkhorn at his side ;</l>
     <l n="80">Stirring the while in the shallow pool</l>
     <l n="81">Of his brains for the lore he learned at school ,</l>
     <l n="82">To garnish the story , with here a streak</l>
     <l n="83">Of Latin , and there another of Greek</l>
