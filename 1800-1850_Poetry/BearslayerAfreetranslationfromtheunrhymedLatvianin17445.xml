    <docImprint>TECHNICAL NOTES</docImprint>
    <docTitle><titlePart>This is a free translation into English heroic verse of Lacplesis ( Bearslayer ) by Andrejs Pumpurs , first published in Latvian in 1888 . The translation here is a corrected version of the original , which was published in 2005 . Lacplesis has been translated into Estonian , Lithuanian , Polish and at least three times into Russian , as well as into Japanese ! An English translation was published by Rita Berzin  in 1988 . This used poetic language , but the text was unrhymed and its metre irregular . It is also very difficult to obtain . Various prose translations of fragments also exist . The present translation is in rhyme and has a strict metre . As far as I know , it is the only existing translation of the entire poem into English verse .</titlePart></docTitle>
   </titlePage>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>In the interests of telling a good story in an easily understandable way I have omitted or shifted to a slightly different location an occasional line in Pumpurs 's text , perhaps a dozen lines in the entire poem . I have also occasionally inserted lines that were not in the original text , again perhaps a dozen in the entire poem . My translation is also very loose in some places-an important priority for me was a poem that flowed well-and I have allowed myself some liberties . I apologize to those who are offended . I have , however , followed the sequence of events exactly as Pumpurs told them , and have retained virtually all Pumpurs 's metaphors and similar poetic devices , such as the moon 's rays being described as bars of silver , or mist as dripping like blood . I have tried to recapture in the English the moods suggested to me by the original Latvian : rustic joy , horror , tenderness , or despair .</p>
   <p>The translation is also free because I wanted to maintain a strict metre as well as to achieve the effect of an English epic poem . The latter goal involved using archaic-sounding words as much as possible , although I preferred words that would be familiar to educated native-speakers of contemporary English , rather than genuinely archaic words . I also employed devices such as inversion of the word order ( e. g ., “ a hero bold ” ) or using adjectives in the place of adverbs ( e. g ., “ the sun set slow ” ) . However , I avoided forms that no longer exist , such as “ thou , ” “ thy , ” or “ doth ” and the like : I believe that these now sound too artificial to modern readers ’ ears .</p>
   <p>Despite the liberties just described , the organization of the work follows Pumpurs 's original division into six cantos of widely differing lengths . However , as aids to following the story I have given the cantos titles , divided them into “ scenes ” , each scene beginning on a new page , and inserted intermediate headings . The scenes and headings are entirely my own invention and , to make it clear that they do not come from Pumpurs , I have put my headings into italics .</p>
   <p>Pumpurs used various stanza structures , ranging from four lines to passages of 250 or more lines without interruption . Where Pumpurs used four - , six - or eight-line stanzas , I have done the same . Later , where Pumpurs used very long stanzas , I have returned to an eight-line or four-line format , largely depending on the number of syllables in a line . I have also sometimes inserted four-line stanzas into sections otherwise consisting of eight-line stanzas , in order to mark a turning point in the action .</p>
   <p>Pumpurs also used differing metrical forms , the number of syllables in a line ranging from six to eighteen . In my translation I have used the iambus as the basic metrical unit throughout the entire poem . The most common metrical form in my translation is iambic pentameter . However , where Pumpurs used eight-syllable lines I have done the same . In such cases I have also often switched to four-line stanzas , in order to increase the “ staccato ” effect of the shorter lines . The original Latvian is largely unrhymed . I have translated into rhyming verse , mainly using the rhyme scheme a , b , a , b , c , d , c , d. In the six-line stanzas the rhyme scheme is a , b , a , b , a , b ; in the four-line stanzas a , b , a , b .</p>
   <p>LATVIAN PROPER NOUNS</p>
   <p>With few exceptions , most noticeably Bearslayer 's name ( Latvian : Lacplesis ) and those of the Black Knight ( Latvian : Tum  ais bruninieks ) and the Father of Destiny ( Latvian : Liktena tevs ) , I have not translated personal and place names , such as “ Perkons ” or “ Kegums ” , but have maintained the Latvian spelling . Thus , Laimdota remains Laimdota , not “ Laima 's Gift ” , and Koknesis is not translated into “ Tree Bearer ” or “ Wood Carrier ” . This is because the original Latvian names have a heroic ring about them , whereas English translations run the risk of sounding ridiculous . Since the Latvian gods and spirits will be unfamiliar to most English speakers I have often inserted into the poem explanations of who they are ( e. g ., “ The God of Thunder , Perkons ” ) .</p>
   <p>NOTES ON PRONUNCIATION</p>
   <p>The poem , as I have translated it , is meant to be read aloud , although this is not essential . Because of the strict iambic metre of the translation , every second syllable must be stressed . In most places I have found English words for which this is compatible with everyday pronunciation , at least in the Australian dialect that I speak . However , it raises some problems for the pronunciation of Latvian geographical and personal names . In this poem , all such words start with a stressed syllable , as is usual in spoken Latvian . However , stressing every second syllable may offend against some readers ’ understanding of correct Latvian usage , I ask for forgiveness in advance . The work is , however , a poem in the English language , and the pronunciation suggested here and in the Glossary is essential for preserving the iambic metre of the English poetry .</p>
   <p>The notes on pronunciation that follow are solely for the purposes of reading this poem , and are not meant as a general guide to pronunciation of the Latvian language . The syllable represented phonetically as “ - a ” should be pronounced as in “ bad ” , and “ - ah ” as a very long “ bad ” . The syllable represented as “ - e ” should be pronounced as in “ bed ” , “ - o ” as in “ hot ” , “ - oh ” as in “ throw ” , “ oo ” as in “ zoo ” , “ ow ” as in “ bough ” , “ - u ” as in “ hut ” and “ uh ” as in “ book ” . Syllables in boldface should be stressed .</p>
   <p>( a ) All untranslated proper nouns , such as personal or place names , start with a stressed syllable ( e. g ., Liga = Lee-gu ) . Where a name has more than two syllables , the first and third are stressed in order to maintain the iambic metre ( e. g ., Spidala = Spee-du-lu ) .</p>
   <p>( b ) The letter “ o ” is a diphthong ( “ oo-oh ” or “ oh-u ” ) . However , as a rule I have adopted a shortened diphthong , to avoid giving the single letter “ o ” two syllables . Thus , it is usually pronounced “ wo ” . For example , the name of the Messenger of the Gods , “ Vaidelots ” , is pronounced “ Vy-du-lwots ” , “ Perkons ” is pronounced “ Pah-kwons ” , and so on . Despite what has just been said , Laimdota is pronounced “ Laim-dwo-tu ” , and “ Koknesis ” is pronounced “ Kwok-ness-is ” , whereas Spidala is always pronounced “ Spee-du-lu ” .</p>
   <p>( c ) The letter combination “ ie ” is also a diphthong , and is pronounced “ ee e ” . Thus , the letters “ liel ” ( as in “ Lielvarde ” ) are pronounced “ Lee-ell ” .</p>
   <p>( d ) A final “ e ” is pronounced . Thus , for instance , “ Lielvarde ” is pronounced “ Lee-ell-var-de ” .</p>
   <p>( e ) Although it does not involve pronouncing Latvian words , “ Latvia ” is prononced “ Lat'vya ” , “ Latvian ( s ) ” “ Lat'vyan ( s ) ” , and “ Destiny ” Dest'ny ” . Many three-syllable words are pronounced similarly : e. g ., “ Daug'va ” “ trav'ler ” , etc .</p>
   <p>GLOSSARY</p>
   <p>To assist readers who are not familiar with Latvian geography and mythology , I have prepared a brief glossary of names and places ( see p. 164 ) . This includes guidance on how to pronounce the names for the purposes of the present work .</p>
   <p>SUMMARY</p>
   <p>It is the turn of the 13th century , 800 years ago in Latvia . The Baltic gods have gathered to consult the Father of Destiny about their own fate and that of the Latvian people . Both are under threat from invading German knights , who have been sent by the Pope to christianize the Baltic region , under the command of Bishop Albert . Perkons , the God of Thunder , calls on all the gods to guard and nurture the Latvians , and they promise to do so , each in his or her own way .</p>
   <p>As the council is breaking up the Goddess Staburadze reveals that she has rescued a young man from the River Daugava , where he was cast down by two witches . She has taken him to her Crystal Palace beneath the river in the whirlpool of Staburags , from which no human can emerge alive . Perkons reveals that this youth is Bearslayer , who will become a noble warrior under the protection of Perkons , and will strive mightily against the forces of evil .</p>
   <p>At the beginning of Canto II the action goes back in time to the Castle of Lielvarde , shortly before the Council of the Gods described in the previous canto . The son of the Lord of Lielvarde reveals mighty strength , killing a bear with his bare hands . This first heroic deed wins him the name “ Bearslayer . ” ( This young man is the hero that Perkons revealed to the other gods in Canto I . ) The youth is not the true son of the Lord of Lielvarde , but a foundling suckled by a female bear in the forest . ( Although it is not directly explained until almost the end of the poem , it is important to know that Bearslayer has bear 's ears , and that if these are cut off he will lose his bearlike strength . ) Bearslayer was brought to Lielvarde as a baby by Vaidelots , a Messenger of the Gods , to be raised until he reached manhood . After killing the bear he is sent to study for seven years in the Castle of Burtnieks , in order to learn the ancient wisdom of the Latvian race . Accompanied by the good advice of his foster father , he sets off .</p>
   <p>On the way to Burtnieks 's Castle , Bearslayer visits the castle of the Latvian Lord Aizkrauklis , where he is stunned by the beauty of Aizkrauklis 's daughter , Spidala . However , he watches her and discovers that she is a witch . He follows her by hiding in a hollow log on which she flies to the Devil 's Pit , and witnesses evil rites , as well as seeing the false holy man , Kangars , promise to serve the Devil by working against the ancient gods and supporting Christianity , because Christians are easier prey for the Devil . On the journey back to Aizkraukle Bearslayer is cast down into the whirlpool of Staburags in the River Daugava by Spidala and another witch . From here he is rescued by Staburadze , as we already know from Canto I , and taken to her Crystal Palace beneath the whirlpool .</p>
   <p>With the help of the beautiful and virtuous maiden , Laimdota , Staburadze nurses Bearslayer back to health . She reveals to him that he has been chosen by the gods to fight against evil , especially Spidala and Kangars , who are plotting in secret . Staburadze gives him a talisman , a magic mirror , and Laimdota gives him a ribbon decorated with an oak-leaf pattern . He leaves the Crystal Palace and is duly turned to stone , as are all mortals , but is restored to life by Perkons . He performs a second heroic deed , saving a boat that is sinking in the raging River Perse by rowing with his bare hands , and is befriended by a powerful youth , Koknesis . Together they ride to Burtnieks , accompanied by the curses of Spidala .</p>
   <p>Canto III opens with Spidala hurrying to the hut of Kangars to warn him that Bearslayer was present in the Devil 's Pit and saw the shameful deeds . To prevent Bearslayer revealing that he and Spidala are in league with the Devil , Kangars decides to lure the young hero into a trap by provoking a war against the Estonian Giant , Kalapuisis , certain that Bearslayer will rush into battle against the invincible foeman and be killed . As Kangars explains this plot to Spidala a terrible storm arises , and Spidala is unable to return home .</p>
   <p>The storm was sent by Perkons to destroy a ship just arriving at the mouth of the River Daugava from Germany , in order to kill the German missionaries it is carrying . Led by the priest , Dietrich , they have come with the intention of forcing the Baltic people to accept Christianity . However , the Livian fisher-folk of the Daugava estuary rescue the passengers from the ship . Thus , they thwart the will of Perkons , who had planned to drown the newcomers , and save the very people who will eventually become their conquerors . The morning after the storm , a fisherman brings Dietrich to Kangars , and an alliance is forged , since both want to introduce Christianity , although for differing reasons .</p>
   <p>Years pass . Bearslayer and Koknesis study hard in the Castle of Burtnieks . Bearslayer has a special reason to seek perfection : Laimdota is the daughter of Burtnieks and has returned home to the castle from Staburadze 's Crystal Palace , where she and Bearslayer met . They fall in love , but just as Bearslayer is about to ask for her hand news arrives that Kalapuisis has entered Latvia and is killing and laying waste . Burtnieks offers Laimdota 's hand to any warrior who can rid them of Kalapuisis , and Bearslayer rides out to face him : The plot seems to be succeeding !</p>
   <p>Bearslayer faces Kalapuisis in single combat , and defeats him . However , just as Bearslayer is about to kill him , Kalapuisis reveals a prophecy told him by his mother that a bear cub from the Daugava , who is of noble rank and equal to Kalapuisis as a warrior , will come and save the Latvians from their conquerors . The two warriors realize that Bearslayer is this bear cub , and that they have a common enemy-the Germans-and make peace , so that they can work together against the invaders .</p>
   <p>Successful in the Estonian war , Bearslayer returns to Burtnieks 's Castle with the other Latvian warriors , and they are greeted in song by the local maidens . Laimdota places an oak-leaf wreath on Bearslayer 's head and sings of his might , promising to make him a true and virtuous wife . Bearslayer replies in song that he will live and die for Laimdota . Amid great joy and feelings of brotherhood the warriors toast Bearslayer , and conclude that the gods personally intervened on his behalf . This divine intervention gives Bearslayer legendary status so that , instead of destroying him , the plot added to his fame .</p>
   <p>Once again , time passes while Bearslayer studies at the Castle of Burtnieks . One night he notices in the fortress 's undercroft a trapdoor , left half-open to reveal a stone staircase leading below . He goes down and follows a tunnel until he enters a large chamber that he judges to be beneath the centre of the lake . He is in the Sunken Castle that Laimdota had told him about . He discovers Laimdota reading an ancient book . She explains to him that if a mortal remains in the Sunken Castle overnight and survives until morning , the castle will rise once more into the light of day . Bearslayer resolves to carry out this heroic task and Laimdota leaves him .</p>
   <p>Midnight passes and the Sunken Castle grows cold . Bearslayer lights a fire from broken wood lying around . Suddenly seven evil spirits enter the room carrying an open coffin , in which an old man with huge sharp teeth and long nails is lying . He begins to groan horribly and complain that he is cold . Bearslayer cannot bear the sound and hauls the man from the coffin to the fire , but the old man tries to bite off Bearslayer 's ears , knowing that without them Bearslayer is weak . Bearslayer fights back and holds the old man in the fire , saying that he will only let him go if the Sunken Castle is raised to the surface .</p>
   <p>At this , a whirlwind springs up and the seven evil spirits return , led by Spidala . They attack Bearslayer and he is about to be defeated when he remembers the mirror that Staburadze gave him . He pulls it out and holds it in Spidala 's face . A howling fills the air and all the evil spirits turn to dust and are whirled round the room in the whirlwind . The spirit of Viduveds , a wise man of ancient times , appears in human form and greets Bearslayer , saying that the young hero will save the Latvian people . Viduveds 's handmaidens make a bed for Bearslayer , and he falls into a deep sleep .</p>
   <p>Next morning the people are amazed to see a castle standing on an island in the middle of the lake . Laimdota tells Burtnieks that Bearslayer has spent the night in the castle , and the old man realizes at once that Bearslayer has broken the magic spell and saved the Sunken Castle . Laimdota and Burtnieks enter the castle and wake Bearslayer . He claims Laimdota as his bride , and Burtnieks gives his blessing , saying that the union of the two clans ( Burtnieks and Lielvarde ) will save the Latvians .</p>
   <p>One evening , later , Laimdota reads to Bearslayer from the ancient books found in the Sunken Castle . She reads how the ancient Latvians were led to the Baltic Sea from a land far to the east by Perkons . With the favour of the gods , they settled in a valley , built a castle , and established a golden age on Earth .</p>
   <p>However , this made the Devil jealous , and he commanded a whirlwind to suck up a lake and deposit it in the valley . This was done and the valley , including the castle , was drowned . The people would have died too , but Liga , the Goddess of Song , saved them by using the music of her kokle to open up under the lake a tunnel that led them to safety . The castle is the one Bearslayer raised , and the tunnel the one he used to enter the castle .</p>
   <p>On another occasion , Laimdota reads to Bearslayer the story of the creation . In eternal space there was once nothing except a celestial light . In it lived God and a second mighty spirit-the Devil . At that time the Devil still obeyed God , although he was already growing rebellious . God decided to create the Earth and sent the Devil to fetch a handful of slime . The Devil was curious and kept a second handful for himself , hiding it in his mouth . When he brought the slime to God , God commanded the slime to form the Earth , throwing it down . The slime began to grow , and formed the level plains of the Earth . However , the slime in the Devil 's mouth also obeyed God and grew until the Devil could no longer hold it in his mouth . He spat it out and it fell to the newly created Earth , forming the mountains .</p>
   <p>From His own substance God created the Sun and Moon . He was so pleased with the Earth and Sun He had just created that He also created the first living creatures : the Sons of the Gods and the Daughters of the Sun . The Moon took a gigantic Daughter of the Sun as his wife , and the stars are their thousands of children . The Sons of the Gods divided up the Earth among themselves .</p>
   <p>The Devil grew more rebellious and began to defy God . A great rivalry grew up between them , and the Devil tried in vain to outdo God , who , however , always had the upper hand . Eventually , God created humans and made them capable only of good , but the Devil interfered and gave them the power to be evil as well as good . God grew furiously angry at seeing His creation ruined , and banished the Devil to Hell . There the Devil created evil demons and with them rose up from Hell and fought against God and all good spirits . Eventually , the Devil was defeated and driven back to Hell , after Perkons intervened in the fight</p>
   <p>Later Laimdota reads from the teachings of the guardian of the Latvian race , in which he listed the tasks of worthy human beings : to seek perfection of the human race , to fight against evil by obeying the ancient teachings , to make just laws and drive out bad rulers , and to love nature .</p>
   <p>All Souls ’ Eve comes . The people of Burtnieks 's Castle celebrate this in the traditional Latvian way . Next morning , however , Laimdota and Koknesis have vanished , and Bearslayer sets off to find them , vowing never to return unless he is successful . Meanwhile , a German ship has arrived at the mouth of the Daugava , and Dietrich and Kangars persuade the the local Latvian Lord , Kaupa , to return in it to Rome with Dietrich . Kangars stays behind , but knows that the Germans ’ friendship is only a trick to gain control of Latvia .</p>
   <p>The ship sails . Just then Bearslayer rides up . He knows full well that Kangars and Spidala have kidnapped Laimdota , and demands that they give her back . Spidala tells him that she is on the ship just vanishing over the horizon . Kangars says that she and Koknesis are lovers . Bearslayer does not believe this lie , although he experiences some doubts , and rides off in deep despair . Spidala gloats over his sorrow . She has her revenge , and Bearslayer 's life is worse than death .</p>
   <p>Bearslayer returns to Lielvarde , his home . He is greeted warmly , but his father sees that something is wrong . Bearslayer tells him all , and his father consoles him with wise words of hope : Perhaps Laimdota loves him still and will yet be saved . Bearslayer spends his days roaming the cliffs above the Daugava brooding , and longing to go with the waters down to the sea to fight against the North Wind and meet the North Wind 's Daughter . One day he vanishes , and no-one knows where he has gone .</p>
   <p>Canto IV opens with Kaupa in Rome . He is seduced by the wealth and power he sees , doubts the old gods , and decides to embrace Christianity and convert the Latvians . Back in Latvia , the people labour long building a walled city for the Germans , who are now present in large numbers-Riga . Once they have their fortress the Germans begin to plunder everything they can get their hands on , to pillage and to destroy . Full of bitterness , the Latvians realize that they have been tricked .</p>
   <p>Meanwhile , in Germany Laimdota is being held captive in a convent . Spidala had tricked her into leaving her father 's castle back in Latvia by pretending to be her mother . Laimdota was then seized by Spidala 's minions , brought to Riga , and placed on the ship to Germany as a prisoner . During the journey Dietrich tries to calm her and tells her that she will soon be the Bride of Christ . Laimdota replies that she loves Bearslayer , will not be forced to become anyone else 's bride and is , in any case , a mortal and not fit to become the bride of Christ . Although hardened and without pangs of conscience , Dietrich blushes at her virtuous answer , and leaves her . Kaupa refuses to help her on the grounds that it is the will of Destiny that she go to Germany . Soon both Dietrich and Kaupa forget about her .</p>
   <p>The convent prioress tries to persuade Laimdota to accept Christianity and threatens to allow her to be seized by a local count and used as a concubine . To escape this fate Laimdota pretends to accept Christianity but , despite this , one night armed men break into the convent and seize her . As they are about to carry her off an unknown warrior appears and fights all the kidnappers on his own . He kills all except one , and rescues Laimdota . She recognizes him as Koknesis and they flee into the mountains . Along the way Koknesis explains how he too was tricked into going on the ship to Germany . Once in Germany , he heard that a Baltic woman was being held in the convent and decided to rescue her , without knowing that it was Laimdota .</p>
   <p>The action turns to the Northern Sea , where Bearslayer is wandering in a ship , lost on the way to Germany to seek Laimdota . The North Wind 's Daughter hears the sailors calling upon her in song , and she comes to them in her own ship . She says that it would be best if they came to her island to rest , before continuing their journey , and Bearslayer agrees . They avoid the Castle of the North Wind , where he is sleeping , perhaps for another month . Once he is awake , the winter will set in and they will not be able to escape because of the ice and storms .</p>
   <p>The island is warmed by fires from the centre of the Earth , and the sailors enjoy a pleasant stay . Eventually the North Wind 's Daughter tells them that her father is about to wake up and that they must leave . She warns them not to return by the route that they came by , because Bearslayer 's enemies now know that he is using that route and may be too strong for him . She describes an alternative route , but warns of its great dangers , including the land of the dog-snout ogres , the Kingdom of Dreams , the Hill of Diamonds , and the Enchanted Isle . The sailors set off in the nick of time : The North Wind has woken up and they are involved in a fearsome storm , from which they barely escape .</p>
   <p>They reach the island of the Dog-Snout Ogres , where they tie up . Bearslayer goes ashore with a party of men to cut up and share the meat of some deer he has already killed . They are at work when suddenly the Dog-Snouts pour out of a cave and attack them . They tear the men apart with their teeth and even Bearslayer is scarcely able to save himself . He is wounded and seems doomed , until he notices that no more Dog-Snouts are coming out of their cave . He slips in to the cave and is able to defend himself with his spear in its narrow opening . The Dog-Snouts then bring up large boulders and block the entrance , trapping Bearslayer inside .</p>
   <p>Back at the ship the sailors wait in vain for their comrades . Their orders forbid them to go ashore and search for them . At the last moment Bearslayer appears and tells them to disembark at once . They do so , and escape the Land of the Dog-Snouts . At sea Bearslayer explains what happened . He got out of the cave by digging a hole at the rear with his spear . This took several days , but he found some raw meat in the cave , and lived on that . The Dog-Snouts were busy watching the front of the cave , and thus did not see Bearslayer as he escaped at the rear .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">They sail away , and reach the Kingdom of Dreams . This is where</l>
     <l n="2">Heaven and Earth come together , the gates of Paradise standing</l>
     <l n="3">alongside the entrance to Hell . This land is the location of the</l>
     <l n="4">Gardens of the Sun , where the Sun returns at dusk and rests at night</l>
     <l n="5">before setting off each morning . Under the protection of the Sons of</l>
     <l n="6">the Gods and the Daughters of the Sun they stay in the pleasant</l>
     <l n="7">Kingdom of Dreams for some time , but eventually set off again .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>They travel in pitch darkness at first , but later see a tiny glint of light , towards which they sail . They come closer and sight the Hill of Diamonds , its peak glowing brilliantly . The ship docks and the sailors rush on shore . Despite Bearslayer 's warning , a sailor climbs to the peak and vanishes . A second does the same . A third ties himself to a rope and is pulled back by his comrades as he is vanishing . He is saved , but never speaks again .</p>
   <p>They sail away and encounter fair winds and weather . Fog obscures the course and they suddenly emerge close to a beautiful island . Bearslayer realizes that this is the Enchanted Isle the North Wind 's Daughter warned against , from which no ship can escape . They try to sail away but are drawn to the island until the ship runs up on its shore .</p>
   <p>Canto V continues on the Enchanted Isle . There is no sign of life , except for a track leading from the forest to a bridge and , at the seaward end of the bridge , a beautiful palace . Inside is a sumptuous meal , and in a second room soft beds for all . The sailors fall upon the food and then all go to bed . Bearslayer arms himself and stands guard at the end of the bridge .</p>
   <p>At midnight a rider comes out of the forest . It is the Three-Headed Demon . He speaks aloud , revealing that he hates Bearslayer , but believes that his enemy is far away , trapped on the Northern Sea . At this Bearslayer roars that he is there . The demon challenges Bearslayer to fight and show his strength . They ride into the thick forest where the demon blows down the trees , so that they will have a clearing in which to fight : One breath clears an area three miles across ! They fight and the demon 's blows drive Bearslayer into the ground up to his knees . None the less , Bearslayer prevails . He then returns to the palace at the bridge and lies down to sleep . Nothing further disturbs their rest that night .</p>
   <p>The next night Bearslayer again stands guard . Again , at midnight a rider comes out of the forest . This time it is the Six-Headed Demon , who also hates Bearslayer and believes that he is lost on the Northern Sea . Again Bearslayer challenges the demon , who clears the forest by blowing down trees , this time six miles around . They fight and Bearslayer is driven into the ground to his hips , but still wins with some difficulty .</p>
   <p>The third night , before going on guard , Bearslayer tells the others that he may need their help . He places Staburadze 's mirror on a table alongside a bowl of water , and tells them that if , during the night , the water turns to blood , they must bring the mirror to his aid . At midnight the Nine-Headed Demon appears at the bridge . Bearslayer and the demon fight in a clearing nine miles across , and Bearslayer is driven into the ground to his armpits . He looks in vain for help from his shipmates , and is about to be defeated . Desperate , he throws his club three miles through the window of the palace where the others are sleeping . This wakes them , they see that the water has turned to blood , and they hasten to bring Bearslayer the mirror . In the nick of time he shows the demon the mirror , and it falls down frozen . Bearslayer climbs out of the ground and kills it .</p>
   <p>To be sure that the island is safe they search it , and discover a beautiful valley in which is a well of clear water , alongside it a leafy apple tree with magnificent fruit . The men want to drink , but first Bearslayer thrusts his sword into the water , marking a triangle . There are screams and the water turns to blood , but soon clears and they drink in safety . After this , the men want to eat apples , but Bearslayer grows angry , saying that they are not there to pick fruit . He threatens to cut down the tree with his sword , but suddenly a voice from the tree begs for mercy . Bearslayer steps back in surprise and the tree turns into a beautiful young woman . To Bearslayer 's horror , it is Spidala .</p>
   <p>Spidala throws herself at his feet and begs for mercy . She swears to make good all her wicked deeds , and never to do evil again . Bearslayer grants her her life -  he fights demons and giants , not women ! Spidala tells him that Laimdota and Koknesis are loyal and pure , and reveals how she and Kangars tricked them into going to Germany . She also reveals how the Old Witch cast a spell on the island to draw in ships . Once trapped on the island 's shore the ships ’ crews sink into a deep sleep . This is the spell that drew Bearslayer 's ship to the island , where the witch intended to trap him . The three demons were her sons . On hearing of their death the Old Witch set a trap by changing herself into the well and Spidala into the apple tree . However , when Bearslayer plunged his sword into the well he killed the witch , and thus broke the spell on Spidala .</p>
   <p>Spidala reminds Bearslayer that it is his duty to return to Latvia and drive out the marauding Germans . She yearns to help , but is trapped in a pact with the Devil . Bearslayer realizes that she is truly repentant and wants to help her . Suddenly he remembers the little package that he brought with him as a souvenir of the Devil 's Pit , and orders some sailors to fetch it and give it to her . When Spidala sees it she is overjoyed : It is her contract with the Devil , and she is now free ! They go to the beach , where Spidala releases the ships and sailors trapped on the shore . Suddenly , among the people released , Bearslayer sees Koknesis and Laimdota !</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Koknesis and Laimdota tell the story of their escape from</l>
     <l n="2">Germany . They too were drawn on shore on the Enchanted Isle by the</l>
     <l n="3">Old Witch , and put into a long sleep . Spidala hangs back , but</l>
     <l n="4">Bearslayer tells the others that it was she who broke the spell on</l>
     <l n="5">them : They thank her , and the four swear eternal friendship .</l>
     <l n="6">Spidala shows them around the island , which she knows well , and some</l>
     <l n="7">of the awakened people decide to live there for good . Eventually ,</l>
     <l n="8">however Bearslayer , Koknesis , Laimdota and Spidala decide to leave .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The evening before they depart , Koknesis wanders back to the well in the valley . He sees Spidala burn her pact with the Devil . She asks him to keep this a secret . He agrees , but in turn tells her his secret : He loves her and wants her to marry him . She eventually agrees . The four set off back to Latvia on Bearslayer 's ship , and on the way Koknesis and Spidala tell Bearslayer and Laimdota about their love . These two are overjoyed . After a long journey they sight Latvian shores , and eventually sail into the mouth of the Daugava .</p>
   <p>Canto VI opens with Midsummer 's Eve in Latvia . The people are called together by the Midsummer Priests . They bring offerings for the gods and gifts for each other , and gather around fires on the Azure Mountain . They pray for blessings for the coming year , and pay respect to the spirits of their ancestors . The oldest priest calls on them to live together in harmony , and many grudges are settled with a handshake . The young men and women begin to dance together .</p>
   <p>While the young people celebrate , the Clan Chieftains meet in council on the Azure Mountain . They are concerned because the prophetic writings kept in the Sacred Grove on the mountainside predict calamity . Lielvardis arrives and reveals that the German knights have captured a number of Latvian stockades and built their own stone castles , and are imposing Christianity at the point of the sword . His own fortress , Lielvarde , has been seized . Bishop Albert is bringing more knights from Germany to take over all Latvia . At this moment Bearslayer appears , together with Koknesis , Laimdota and Spidala . Bearslayer is elected leader of the Latvian warriors . All pledge themselves to fight to free their land , and return to their homes to prepare for war .</p>
   <p>Bearslayer and Laimdota , as well as Koknesis and Spidala , are married at the Castle of Burtnieks , Laimdota 's home . There is a great wedding celebration , but this is cut short by Burtnieks , who tells them that they will soon be at war . The new couples have little time for wedded bliss before the men have to set off to fight the German invaders , and Laimdota and Spidala , refusing to be separated so soon from their new hus - bands , set off with them . The Latvian host gathers and marches on Turaida . On the way , they eliminate German infestation whenever they encounter it .</p>
   <p>Alarmed by the Latvian uprising , many Germans have fled to Turaida and taken refuge in the stone castle built there by the Germans . The Latvians lay siege to the castle , and eventually are able to scale the walls at night and fight on the ramparts . A fearful battle ensues , with heavy losses on both sides . Bearslayer kills many Germans and , realizing that he is too strong for them , the Germans surrender . Among those captured is Dietrich , who is handed over to the locals for punishment . However , he tricks them into setting him free . They now march on Lielvarde , Bearslayer 's home , where the German knight , Daniel , has built a stone castle . Just before they arrive , Daniel invites the chieftains of some Latvian clans that had fled into the forest to a parley . However , once he has them in a great pavilion he locks them in and sets fire to it . The elders cry for help as Daniel and his men watch in glee from the castle walls .</p>
   <p>In the nick of time Bearslayer arrives with his army . He rescues the chieftains and attacks the German castle . The Germans fight hard but are defeated , and all except Daniel are slaughtered . He is handed to the local people for punishment , and they throw him into the Daugava tied to a plank . Bearslayer re-establishes himself at Lielvarde</p>
   <p>Meanwhile , Albert has returned to Germany to recruit more knights . He leaves Kaupa in charge in Riga , to where most Germans have now retreated . All seems well for the Latvians , and Bearslayer and Laimdota settle down to married life together . The others too return to their homes , thinking to live out their lives in peace .</p>
   <p>Springtime comes , and the Latvians have little thought of war . Even Kangars is working in his garden . His life is bitter : He receives no honour from any one , any more . He knows that death will bring him the torments of Hell , while his remaining days of life are wracked with the knowledge of his own wickedness . One day Dietrich comes to him and asks him to communicate with evil spirits to discover the source of Bearslayer 's strength . Kangars says that it is no concern of his that Bearslayer is killing Germans , but that he has his own reasons for wanting to destroy the young man . He wrestles with demons for three days and nights without sleep , and they reveal to him the secret of Bearslayer 's strength-his bear 's ears .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Among the new knights brought back from Germany by Albert is the</l>
     <l n="2">Black Knight . He is already experienced in doing wicked deeds in</l>
     <l n="3">Germany . He claims to be the son of a witch and immune to harm from</l>
     <l n="4">wounds . One day Kaupa takes a party of knights , including the Black</l>
     <l n="5">Knight , to Lielvarde , and asks for admission , saying that he wishes</l>
     <l n="6">to make peace between the Latvians and Albert . Bearslayer wants</l>
     <l n="7">peace and the Germans are admitted . They are treated well , and</l>
     <l n="8">Bearslayer organizes a tournament to entertain them .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>In the tournament , both Bearslayer and the Black Knight defeat their opponents , and the Black Knight suggests that they fight each other . Bearslayer refuses , although he does not want to insult the Black Knight . The Black Knight then says that it would hardly be a test of his strength to fight Bearslayer , any way , despite all Bearslayer 's boasting . Stung by this , Bearslayer seizes his sword and the two fight .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">At first Bearslayer thinks that it is mere sport , but the Black</l>
     <l n="2">Knight fights with great vigour , and suddenly cuts off one of</l>
     <l n="3">Bearslayer 's ears . Enraged , Bearslayer now attacks in earnest , and</l>
     <l n="4">with a terrible blow of his sword splits open the Black Knight 's</l>
     <l n="5">armour and wounds him . However , his sword breaks . Seeing this , the</l>
     <l n="6">Black Knight attacks again , and cuts off Bearslayer 's other ear .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Terribly angry , Bearslayer seizes the Black Knight and they wrestle together . In their fight they stumble to the very edge of the high cliffs above the River Daugava . Bearslayer 's men look on , grown pale with apprehension and rooted to the spot with fear . Three times Bearslayer lifts up the Black Knight , but each time the German kicks free . Finally , Bearslayer throws him over the cliff into the river 's depths , but the Black Knight drags Bearslayer with him . Weighed down by the knight 's heavy armour , they sink to the bottom . At this moment the waves roar and an island rises up in the river . In the castle , Laimdota , who had had a premonition of disaster , shrieks and ends her own life .</p>
   <p>Soon , the Latvian heroes are defeated one by one by the Germans , for whom they are no match without Bearslayer . The Germans establish themselves as harsh masters , and the Latvian people are plunged into centuries of slavery . However , for them Bearslayer is not dead , but sleeps beneath the island in a golden bed .</p>
   <p>Even today , sometimes at midnight boatmen on the Daugava see two shadowy figures locked in struggle on the cliffs above the river , while in the ruins of the old castle of Lielvarde a little flame burns . The figures struggling on the cliff top are Bearslayer and the Black Knight , and the flame in the castle is Laimdota . Each time they fight the two warriors plunge together into the river . There is a terrible scream in the castle , and the flame goes out .</p>
   <p>However , the day will come when Bearslayer will defeat the Black Knight and cast him down alone into the river to drown . On that day , the Latvians will be free !</p>

     <l n="425">Into his breast an urgent feeling poured ,</l>
     <l n="426">The wish that he fulfil his father 's charge .</l>
     <l n="427">And so he promised to observe all that ,</l>
     <l n="428">Embraced his father , pressed his hand so stout ,</l>
     <l n="429">Then leaped into his saddle , doffed his hat ,</l>
     <l n="430">And , raising shield and lance , rode boldly out .</l>

     <l n="432">He arrives at the castle</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="70">
     <l n="433">Within the castle , watching from his chair ,</l>
     <l n="434">Sat old Aizkrauklis wrapped in thought profound .</l>
     <l n="435">His only daughter , Spidala the fair ,</l>
     <l n="436">Sat at the pane with beads and rings decked round .</l>
     <l n="437">Her face possessed a haunting beauty rare ,</l>
     <l n="438">But yet her eyes showed wildness without bound .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="71">
     <l n="439">And so that tender spell she did not weave ,</l>
     <l n="440">That gently draws and steals the young man 's heart ;</l>
     <l n="441">Her ardent eyes too swiftly could deceive-</l>
     <l n="442">To gaze into them risked a burning dart .</l>
     <l n="443">“ Oh , Spidala , ” her father sought her leave ,</l>
     <l n="444">And slowly raised his head in thoughtful art :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="72">
     <l n="445">“ I wish to know an answer still this morn :</l>
     <l n="446">Whence come those finest jewels that , preening vain ,</l>
     <l n="447">You wear your neck and hands thus to adorn ? ” -</l>
     <l n="448">That Spidala then started he saw plain ,</l>
     <l n="449">The question shocked her that his voice had borne ,</l>
     <l n="450">Yet in a trice her answer came again :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="73">
     <l n="451">“ Godmother gave to me these jewels to own ,</l>
     <l n="452">When last into our village she came here ;</l>
     <l n="453">In golden caskets more I have been shown . ”</l>
     <l n="454">The old man spoke : “ Alas my daughter dear ,</l>
     <l n="455">Such gifts to take I cannot more condone ,</l>
     <l n="456">And in the future must forbid , I fear . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="74">
     <l n="457">“ She is a witch , and in the people 's view ,</l>
     <l n="458">A fearsome dragon shelters in her care ;</l>

     <l n="460">The dragon brings her jewels and objects rare ,</l>
     <l n="461">Dark evil things , and so I say to you ,</l>
     <l n="462">A pious girl her gifts should never wear . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="75">
     <l n="463">Now Spidala , to hide her blushing face ,</l>
     <l n="464">Looked out into the courtyard , near too late ,</l>
     <l n="465">And spoke as though his words she gave no grace :</l>
     <l n="466">“ A visitor is hither come in state .</l>
     <l n="467">Look where a youthful knight has reached this place ,</l>
     <l n="468">And down below will pass in through the gate ! ” -</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="76">
     <l n="469">The Castle of Aizkraukle lonely stands ,</l>
     <l n="470">Far distant from the Daugava 's verdant bounds ,</l>
     <l n="471">And in the forest roam wild bears in bands ,</l>
     <l n="472">While in the night the howl of wolves loud sounds .</l>
     <l n="473">Uncertain paths lead through these risky lands ,</l>
     <l n="474">And strangers seldom reach the castle 's grounds .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="77">
     <l n="475">Thus Spidala with wonder took good heed ,</l>
     <l n="476">To see what rider thence the path had brought ,</l>
     <l n="477">Who rode into the castle on his steed. - </l>
     <l n="478">Aizkrauklis too from out the window sought</l>
     <l n="479">To test of him his measure and his breed ,</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="78">
     <l n="481">He bowed towards the window , then , polite ,</l>
     <l n="482">He said his path to Burtnieks must run ,</l>
     <l n="483">His neighbour 's care he sought thus for the night. - </l>
     <l n="484">Aizkrauklis hurried out , his friendship won ,</l>
     <l n="485">And warmly told his pleasure at the sight</l>
     <l n="486">Of famous Lielvarde 's mighty son .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="79">
     <l n="487">Bearslayer falls under Spidala 's spell</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="80">
     <l n="488">The handsome youth dismounted lithely then ;</l>
     <l n="489">A stable lad swift to his stirrup ran .</l>
     <l n="490">He pressed the old man 's hand once and again ,</l>
     <l n="491">And entered straight the castle 's lofty span. - </l>
     <l n="492">But soon as Spidala approached the men ,</l>
     <l n="493">Within his bones a shivering cold began .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="81">
     <l n="494">Such beauty in his life had had no peer ! -</l>
     <l n="495">The deep , dark eyes of Spidala grew wide ,</l>
     <l n="496">And in their depths enchanted flame burned clear .</l>
     <l n="497">With outstretched hand a greeting warm she cried :</l>
     <l n="498">“ A stately knight so bold is welcome here .</l>
     <l n="499">A future hero 's presence swells our pride . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="82">
     <l n="500">His tongue struck dumb , Bearslayer found no word. - </l>
     <l n="501">Of jewelled beauty fit to conquer men ,</l>
     <l n="502">In his short life he had not seen nor heard. - </l>
     <l n="503">No answer came , so Spidala turned then ,</l>
     <l n="504">With gliding litheness serpentlike she stirred ,</l>
     <l n="505">And deeply gazed into his eyes again .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="83">
     <l n="506">Her body moved with strangely supple grace ,</l>
     <l n="507">So lithe it made the young man 's senses swim .</l>
     <l n="508">But then Aizkrauklis sent the girl apace</l>
     <l n="509">To make at once and serve a feast for him. - </l>
     <l n="510">So soon her sensuous beauty left the place ,</l>
     <l n="511">Bearslayer 's mind returned to matters grim .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="84">
     <l n="512">When later fitting words he found at last ,</l>
     <l n="513">Then Spidala made answer in fair guise ;</l>
     <l n="514">The frightful swooning moment now was past. - </l>
     <l n="515">The young man , heeding wisdom 's counsel wise ,</l>
     <l n="516">Firm armed himself , though piercing looks flew fast ,</l>
     <l n="517">That burning shot from Spidala 's dark eyes .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="85">
     <l n="518">The night drew on ; the fleeting time soon went ,</l>
     <l n="519">And Spidala , uneasy at the hour ,</l>
     <l n="520">Soon said she felt within her limbs the bent</l>
     <l n="521">Before the midnight 's chime to seek her bower .</l>
     <l n="522">And if Bearslayer too were weary spent ,</l>
     <l n="523">To bed she would direct him , in the tower .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="86">
     <l n="524">The young man went , by Spidala struck deep ,</l>
     <l n="525">But by Aizkrauklis with “ Rest well , ” consoled .</l>
     <l n="526">She led the youth across the castle 's keep ,</l>
     <l n="527">Into a jewelled bedroom hung with gold .</l>
     <l n="528">“ This night in godlike comfort you will sleep , ”</l>
     <l n="529">She smiling said , “ Bearslayer , hero bold . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="87">
     <l n="530">Bearslayer gazed with wonder at the sight :</l>
     <l n="531">As soft and fine as drifted snow the bed ,</l>
     <l n="532">With purple covers decked , and sheets of white ,</l>
     <l n="533">And trimmed all round with ribbons of blood red .</l>
     <l n="534">Sweet-smelling breezes wafted through the night ,</l>
     <l n="535">And like enchantments circled round his head .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="88">
     <l n="536">He stared at Spidala 's lush beauty rare ,</l>

     <l n="538">Forgetting straight all caution 's wisdom there ,</l>
     <l n="539">The young man dared his arms to her to raise .</l>
     <l n="540">At once a shadow dark flew through the air ,</l>
     <l n="541">And Spidala straight vanished from his gaze. - </l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="89">
     <l n="542">The midnight sky a host of stars had brought ;</l>
     <l n="543">From heaven shone the moonlight 's ghostly glow ,</l>
     <l n="544">That in the valley bars of silver wrought .</l>
     <l n="545">Within his room the youth , with spirit low ,</l>
     <l n="546">Threw back his shutter , gazed out on the court ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="90">
     <l n="548">Once more it seemed to him that in the air</l>
     <l n="549">Dark shadows high across the moon flew hence .</l>
     <l n="550">Perhaps foul witches from the Devil 's lair</l>
     <l n="551">To blackest work flew out , he knew not whence .</l>
     <l n="552">At once Bearslayer firm resolved to dare ,</l>

     <l n="554">Spidala is revealed as a witch</l>

     <l n="555">Next morning soon the youth made this request :</l>
     <l n="556">It pleased him in the castle there so well ,</l>
     <l n="557">He wished to stay a few short days as guest ,</l>
     <l n="558">There in his neighbour 's pleasant halls to dwell .</l>
     <l n="559">Aizkrauklis straight agreed that he should rest ,</l>
     <l n="560">With pleasure felt his heart begin to swell .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="93">
     <l n="561">As night there deepened , Spidala soon said :</l>

     <l n="564">She left the room and wished them sweet repose !</l>

     <l n="570">Who through the doorway passed in darkness late. - </l>
     <l n="571">At midnight hour the portal opened slow ,</l>

     <l n="579">A twisted log lay at the courtyard 's rim ,</l>

     <l n="582">Firm with her staff she smote its surface dry .</l>
     <l n="583">And , answering the hissing witch 's whim ,</l>

     <l n="589">But such a task beyond his strength would surge ,</l>
