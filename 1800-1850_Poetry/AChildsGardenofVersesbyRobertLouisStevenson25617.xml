    <docTitle><titlePart>BY WAY OF INTRODUCTION Robert Lewis Balfour Stevenson , or Robert Louis Stevenson , as the world knows him , was still a boy when he published this rare volume of “ A Child 's Garden of Verses , ” although by the calendar he was thirty-five years old . You and I have sighed , no doubt , to be a boy again , but here was one who , while he outgrew his knickerbockers , never outgrew the quick sympathy , the brave heart , the fresh outlook , the confident faith and buoyant spirit of the little Scotch boy who roamed the hills ‘ round Edinburgh . Better than any man of any time he was able to enter into the heart of a boy , to view things with a boy 's eyes , and to write of them in simple verse , touched with the warmth and color of his rich imagination . In these “ Verses ” he writes as a child rather than about children , and in this lies much of the charm which they possess for little readers . There is in them the surprise of reality , the beauty of a simple rhythm , and the mysterious flavor of magic that grips a boy 's heart and will not let him go until the book has become a part of him . Surely this is a rare quality in schoolbooks .</titlePart></docTitle>
    <docImprint>The Stevensons had been famous engineers for more than a hundred years , building lighthouses along the Scottish coast , and it was natural that his father should have expected Robert Louis to follow in the family footsteps . But the slim boy with brown eyes , who at eight had written a “ History of Moses , ” and illustrated it with his own pen ; who was slow to learn from books , but quick to understand things that he saw and felt ; the boy who carried a volume of history in one pocket and a notebook in another , had other plans for himself , and even his father came to see the wisdom of his son 's choice of a literary life . As early as<date>1873</date>, when only twenty-three years old , Stevenson was ordered south for the winter by his physician , to ward off impending consumption . For more than twenty years , or until his death in Samoa late in<date>1894</date>, he was never far from this pursuing enemy . It followed him over tossing seas and through many lands as he journeyed in search of health ; yet through all these years he carried a brave and happy heart , and wrote at the end this Requiem , the last three lines of which are upon his tomb on the mountain-top in Samoa ; “ Under the wide and starry sky , Dig the grave and let me lie . Glad did I live and gladly die , And I laid me down with a will . “ This be the verse you grave for me : Here he lies where he longed to be ; Home is the sailor , home from sea , And the hunter home from the hill . ”</docImprint>
    <docTitle><titlePart>Robert Louis Stevenson 's first book , “ An Inland Voyage , ” was published in 1878 , when he was twenty-eight years old , and is a fresh and charming account of a canoe trip up the rivers of Holland . It was during this journey that he wrote : “ If we were charged so much a head for sunsets , or if God sent around a drum before the hawthorn came into flower , what a work we should make about their beauty ! But these things , like good companions , stupid people early cease to observe . ” The next year came his “ Travels With a Donkey , ” which told in the same naïve style the story of his journey through the Cevennes Mountains with no other companion than a donkey , whose gait he describes as being “ As much slower than a walk as a walk is slower than a run . ”</titlePart></docTitle>
    <docImprint>He first visited<country>America</country>in<date>1879</date>, in search of health , returning in<date>1880</date>to Scotland with Mrs. Stevenson , whom he had married in California . In<date>1887</date>he came again with the hope that a dry winter in the Adirondack Mountains would stand off the hand of Death . But he was little benefited , and took up his search for health by chartering a yacht for a voyage through the South Seas . It was on this trip that he fell in love with the beauty of the scenery and the healthful climate of Samoa , and in<date>1890</date>he took up his home there , never again to leave the island except for occasional visits to Honolulu and<settlement>Sydney</settlement>. And when the time came for him to die , the natives , with their knives and axes cut a path up the steep mountain-side and carried him on their broad shoulders to his grave on the mountain-top .</docImprint>
    <docTitle><titlePart>“ A Child 's Garden of Verses ” was first published in London in 1885 , and long ago became a children 's classic ; yet it is now for the first time made available as a supplementary reader for the primary grades in a suitable form and at a possible price . There have been many and beautiful editions , but they have all appealed to “ grown-ups ” rather than to boys and girls to whom the book really belongs . To put such a book , with its simple style , its wise observations , its kindly sympathy , and fanciful humor into the hands of a boy or girl , is not only to make him happy , it is to start him on the straight path to culture . This volume contains all the poems originally appearing under the title “ A Child 's Garden of Verses . ” The poems grouped under “ The Child Alone , ” “ Garden Days , ” and “ Envoys ” have been omitted , as many of them are too philosophical to be understood by children in the primary grades .</titlePart></docTitle>
    <docImprint>The illustrations in this book are used by special arrangement with Harper &amp; Brothers of<settlement>New York</settlement>City , who publish the complete “ Verses ” in a beautiful edition suitable for the home or the library . So with Stevenson 's own words the book is yours : “ Go little book , and wish to all , Flowers in the garden , meat in the hall , A living river by the door , A nightingale in the sycamore . ” E. O. G. TO ALISON CUNNINGHAM FROM HER BOY</docImprint>

     <p>For your most comfortable hand That led me through the uneven land : For all the story-books you read : For all the pains you comforted : For all you pitied , all you bore , In sad and happy days of yore :— My second Mother , my first Wife , The angel of my infant life — From the sick child , now well and old , Take , nurse , the little book you hold ! And grant it , Heaven , that all who read May find as dear a nurse at need , And every child who lists my rhyme , In the bright , fireside , nursery clime , May hear it in as kind a voice As made my childish days rejoice !
