    <body>
     <p>In collecting the following poems I have to thank the editors and proprietors of the periodicals in which certain of them have appeared for permission to reclaim them .</p>
     <p>Now that the miscellany is brought together , some lack of concord in pieces written at widely severed dates , and in contrasting moods and circumstances , will be obvious enough . This I cannot help , but the sense of disconnection , particularly in respect of those lyrics penned in the first person , will be immaterial when it is borne in mind that they are to be regarded , in the main , as dramatic monologues by different characters .</p>
     <p>As a whole they will , I hope , take the reader forward , even if not far , rather than backward . I should add that some lines in the early-dated poems have been rewritten , though they have been left substantially unchanged .</p>

      <head>THE REVISITATION</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">As I lay awake at night-time</l>
       <l n="2">In an ancient country barrack known to ancient cannoneers ,</l>
       <l n="3">And recalled the hopes that heralded each seeming brave and bright time</l>
       <l n="4">Of my primal purple years ,</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="5">Much it haunted me that , nigh there ,</l>
       <l n="6">I had borne my bitterest loss — when One who went , came not again ;</l>
       <l n="7">In a joyless hour of discord , in a joyless-hued July there -</l>
       <l n="8">A July just such as then .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="9">And as thus I brooded longer ,</l>
       <l n="10">With my faint eyes on the feeble square of wan-lit window frame ,</l>
       <l n="11">A quick conviction sprung within me , grew , and grew yet stronger ,</l>
       <l n="12">That the month-night was the same ,</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="13">Too , as that which saw her leave me</l>
       <l n="14">On the rugged ridge of Waterstone , the peewits plaining round ;</l>
       <l n="15">And a lapsing twenty years had ruled that — as it were to grieve me -</l>
       <l n="16">I should near the once-loved ground .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="17">Though but now a war-worn stranger</l>
       <l n="18">Chance had quartered here , I rose up and descended to the yard .</l>
       <l n="19">All was soundless , save the troopers ’ horses tossing at the manger ,</l>
       <l n="20">And the sentry keeping guard .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="21">Through the gateway I betook me</l>
       <l n="22">Down the High Street and beyond the lamps , across the battered bridge ,</l>
       <l n="23">Till the country darkness clasped me and the friendly shine forsook me ,</l>
       <l n="24">And I bore towards the Ridge ,</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="25">With a dim unowned emotion</l>
       <l n="26">Saying softly : “ Small my reason , now at midnight , to be here . . .</l>
       <l n="27">Yet a sleepless swain of fifty with a brief romantic notion</l>
       <l n="28">May retrace a track so dear . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="29">Thus I walked with thoughts half-uttered</l>
       <l n="30">Up the lane I knew so well , the grey , gaunt , lonely Lane of Slyre ;</l>
       <l n="31">And at whiles behind me , far at sea , a sullen thunder muttered</l>
       <l n="32">As I mounted high and higher .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="9">
       <l n="33">Till , the upper roadway quitting ,</l>
       <l n="34">I adventured on the open drouthy downland thinly grassed ,</l>
       <l n="35">While the spry white scuts of conies flashed before me , earthward flitting ,</l>
       <l n="36">And an arid wind went past .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="10">
       <l n="37">Round about me bulged the barrows</l>
       <l n="38">As before , in antique silence — immemorial funeral piles -</l>
       <l n="39">Where the sleek herds trampled daily the remains of flint-tipt arrows</l>
       <l n="40">Mid the thyme and chamomiles ;</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="11">
       <l n="41">And the Sarsen stone there , dateless ,</l>
       <l n="42">On whose breast we had sat and told the zephyrs many a tender vow ,</l>
       <l n="43">Held the heat of yester sun , as sank thereon one fated mateless</l>
       <l n="44">From those far fond hours till now .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="12">
       <l n="45">Maybe flustered by my presence</l>
       <l n="46">Rose the peewits , just as all those years back , wailing soft and loud ,</l>
       <l n="47">And revealing their pale pinions like a fitful phosphorescence</l>
       <l n="48">Up against the cope of cloud ,</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="13">
       <l n="49">Where their dolesome exclamations</l>
       <l n="50">Seemed the voicings of the self-same throats I had heard when life was</l>
       <l n="51">green ,</l>
       <l n="52">Though since that day uncounted frail forgotten generations</l>
       <l n="53">Of their kind had flecked the scene . -</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="14">
       <l n="54">And so , living long and longer</l>
       <l n="55">In a past that lived no more , my eyes discerned there , suddenly ,</l>
       <l n="56">That a figure broke the skyline — first in vague contour , then stronger ,</l>
       <l n="57">And was crossing near to me .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="15">
       <l n="58">Some long-missed familiar gesture ,</l>
       <l n="59">Something wonted , struck me in the figure 's pause to list and heed ,</l>
       <l n="60">Till I fancied from its handling of its loosely wrapping vesture</l>
       <l n="61">That it might be She indeed .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="16">
       <l n="62">‘ Twas not reasonless : below there</l>
       <l n="63">In the vale , had been her home ; the nook might hold her even yet ,</l>
       <l n="64">And the downlands were her father 's fief ; she still might come and go there ;</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="17">
       <l n="65">So I rose , and said , “ Agnette ! ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="18">
       <l n="66">With a little leap , half-frightened ,</l>
       <l n="67">She withdrew some steps ; then letting intuition smother fear</l>
       <l n="68">In a place so long-accustomed , and as one whom thought enlightened ,</l>
       <l n="69">She replied : “ What — THAT voice ?— here ! ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="19">
       <l n="70">“ Yes , Agnette !— And did the occasion</l>
       <l n="71">Of our marching hither make you think I MIGHT walk where we two — ’</l>
       <l n="72">“ O , I often come , ” she murmured with a moment 's coy evasion ,</l>
       <l n="73">“ ( ‘ Tis not far ) ,— and — think of you . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="20">
       <l n="74">Then I took her hand , and led her</l>
       <l n="75">To the ancient people 's stone whereon I had sat . There now sat we ;</l>
       <l n="76">And together talked , until the first reluctant shyness fled her ,</l>
       <l n="77">And she spoke confidingly .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="21">
       <l n="78">“ It is JUST as ere we parted ! ”</l>
       <l n="79">Said she , brimming high with joy .— “ And when , then , came you here , and why ? ”</l>
       <l n="80">“ — Dear , I could not sleep for thinking of our trystings when twin-hearted . ”</l>
       <l n="81">She responded , “ Nor could I .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="22">
       <l n="82">“ There are few things I would rather</l>
       <l n="83">Than be wandering at this spirit-hour — lone-lived , my kindred dead -</l>
       <l n="84">On this wold of well-known feature I inherit from my father :</l>
       <l n="85">Night or day , I have no dread . . .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="23">
       <l n="86">“ O I wonder , wonder whether</l>
       <l n="87">Any heartstring bore a signal-thrill between us twain or no ? -</l>
       <l n="88">Some such influence can , at times , they say , draw severed souls together . ”</l>
       <l n="89">I said , “ Dear , we 'll dream it so . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="24">
       <l n="90">Each one 's hand the other 's grasping ,</l>
       <l n="91">And a mutual forgiveness won , we sank to silent thought ,</l>
       <l n="92">A large content in us that seemed our rended lives reclasping ,</l>
       <l n="93">And contracting years to nought .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="25">
       <l n="94">Till I , maybe overweary</l>
       <l n="95">From the lateness , and a wayfaring so full of strain and stress</l>
       <l n="96">For one no longer buoyant , to a peak so steep and eery ,</l>
       <l n="97">Sank to slow unconsciousness . . .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="26">
       <l n="98">How long I slept I knew not ,</l>
       <l n="99">But the brief warm summer night had slid when , to my swift surprise ,</l>
       <l n="100">A red upedging sun , of glory chambered mortals view not ,</l>
       <l n="101">Was blazing on my eyes ,</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="27">
       <l n="102">From the Milton Woods to Dole-Hill</l>
       <l n="103">All the spacious landscape lighting , and around about my feet</l>
       <l n="104">Flinging tall thin tapering shadows from the meanest mound and mole-hill ,</l>
       <l n="105">And on trails the ewes had beat .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="28">
       <l n="106">She was sitting still beside me ,</l>
       <l n="107">Dozing likewise ; and I turned to her , to take her hanging hand ;</l>
       <l n="108">When , the more regarding , that which like a spectre shook and tried me</l>
       <l n="109">In her image then I scanned ;</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="29">
       <l n="110">That which Time 's transforming chisel</l>
       <l n="111">Had been tooling night and day for twenty years , and tooled too well ,</l>
       <l n="112">In its rendering of crease where curve was , where was raven , grizzle -</l>
       <l n="113">Pits , where peonies once did dwell .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="30">
       <l n="114">She had wakened , and perceiving</l>
       <l n="115">( I surmise ) my sigh and shock , my quite involuntary dismay ,</l>
       <l n="116">Up she started , and — her wasted figure all throughout it heaving -</l>
       <l n="117">Said , “ Ah , yes : I am THUS by day !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="31">
       <l n="118">“ Can you really wince and wonder</l>
       <l n="119">That the sunlight should reveal you such a thing of skin and bone ,</l>
       <l n="120">As if unaware a Death'shYpppHeNhead must of need lie not far under</l>
       <l n="121">Flesh whose years out-count your own ?</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="32">
       <l n="122">“ Yes : that movement was a warning</l>
       <l n="123">Of the worth of man 's devotion !— Yes , Sir , I am OLD , ” said she ,</l>
       <l n="124">“ And the thing which should increase love turns it quickly into scorning -</l>
       <l n="125">And your new-won heart from me ! ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="33">
       <l n="126">Then she went , ere I could call her ,</l>
       <l n="127">With the too proud temper ruling that had parted us before ,</l>
       <l n="128">And I saw her form descend the slopes , and smaller grow and smaller ,</l>
       <l n="129">Till I caught its course no more . . .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="34">
       <l n="130">True ; I might have dogged her downward ;</l>
       <l n="131">- But it MAY be ( though I know not ) that this trick on us of Time</l>
       <l n="132">Disconcerted and confused me .— Soon I bent my footsteps townward ,</l>
       <l n="133">Like to one who had watched a crime .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="35">
       <l n="134">Well I knew my native weakness ,</l>
       <l n="135">Well I know it still . I cherished her reproach like physic-wine ,</l>
       <l n="136">For I saw in that emaciate shape of bitterness and bleakness</l>
       <l n="137">A nobler soul than mine .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="36">
       <l n="138">Did I not return , then , ever ? -</l>

     <p>NOTES .— “ Windwhistle ” ( Stanza iv . ) . The highness and dryness of Windwhistle Inn was impressed upon the writer two or three years ago , when , after climbing on a hot afternoon to the beautiful spot near which it stands and entering the inn for tea , he was informed by the landlady that none could be had , unless he would fetch water from a valley half a mile off , the house containing not a drop , owing to its situation . However , a tantalizing row of full barrels behind her back testified to a wetness of a certain sort , which was not at that time desired .</p>
     <p>“ Marshal 's Elm ” ( Stanza vi . ) so picturesquely situated , is no longer an inn , though the house , or part of it , still remains . It used to exhibit a fine old swinging sign .</p>
     <p>“ Blue Jimmy ” ( Stanza x . ) was a notorious horse-stealer of Wessex in those days , who appropriated more than a hundred horses before he was caught , among others one belonging to a neighbour of the writer 's grandfather . He was hanged at the now demolished Ivel-chester or Ilchester jail above mentioned — that building formerly of so many sinister associations in the minds of the local peasantry , and the continual haunt of fever , which at last led to its condemnation . Its site is now an innocent-looking green meadow .</p>
