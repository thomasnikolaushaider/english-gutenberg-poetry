    <head>THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE</head>
     <l n="1">Adieu to Belashanny !</l>
     <l n="2">where I was bred and born ;</l>
     <l n="3">Go where I may , I 'll think of you ,</l>
     <l n="4">as sure as night and morn .</l>
     <l n="5">The kindly spot , the friendly town ,</l>
     <l n="6">where every one is known ,</l>
     <l n="7">And not a face in all the place</l>
     <l n="8">but partly seems my own ;</l>
     <l n="9">There 's not a house or window ,</l>
     <l n="10">there 's not a field or hill ,</l>
     <l n="11">But , east or west , in foreign lands ,</l>
     <l n="12">I 'll recollect them still .</l>
     <l n="13">I leave my warm heart with you ,</l>
     <l n="14">tho ’ my back I 'm forced to turn —</l>
     <l n="15">Adieu to Belashanny ,</l>
     <l n="16">and the winding banks of Erne !</l>
   </lg>
   <p>No more on pleasant evenings we 'll saunter down the Mall , When the trout is rising to the fly , the salmon to the fall . The boat comes straining on her net , and heavily she creeps , Cast off , cast off — she feels the oars , and to her berth she sweeps ; Now fore and aft keep hauling , and gathering up the clew , Till a silver wave of salmon rolls in among the crew . Then they may sit , with pipes a-lit , and many a joke and ‘ yarn ’ ;— Adieu to Belashanny , and the winding banks of Erne !</p>
   <p>The music of the waterfall , the mirror of the tide , When all the green-hill 'd harbour is full from side to side , From Portnasun to Bulliebawns , and round the Abbey Bay , From rocky Inis Saimer to Coolnargit sandhills gray ; While far upon the southern line , to guard it like a wall , The Leitrim mountains clothed in blue gaze calmly over all , And watch the ship sail up or down , the red flag at her stern ;— Adieu to these , adieu to all the winding banks of Erne !</p>
   <p>Farewell to you , Kildoney lads , and them that pull an oar , A lug-sail set , or haul a net , from the Point to Mullaghmore ; From Killybegs to bold Slieve-League , that ocean-mountain steep , Six hundred yards in air aloft , six hundred in the deep , From Dooran to the Fairy Bridge , and round by Tullen strand , Level and long , and white with waves , where gull and curlew stand ; Head out to sea when on your lee the breakers you discern !— Adieu to all the billowy coast , and winding banks of Erne !</p>
   <p>Farewell , Coolmore ,— Bundoran ! and your summer crowds that run From inland homes to see with joy th ’ Atlantic-setting sun ; To breathe the buoyant salted air , and sport among the waves ; To gather shells on sandy beach , and tempt the gloomy caves ; To watch the flowing , ebbing tide , the boats , the crabs , the fish ; Young men and maids to meet and smile , and form a tender wish ; The sick and old in search of health , for all things have their turn — And I must quit my native shore , and the winding banks of Erne !</p>
   <p>Farewell to every white cascade from the Harbour to Belleek , And every pool where fins may rest , and ivy-shaded creek ; The sloping fields , the lofty rocks , where ash and holly grow , The one split yew-tree gazing on the curving flood below ; The Lough , that winds through islands under Turaw mountain green ; And Castle Caldwell 's stretching woods , with tranquil bays between ; And Breesie Hill , and many a pond among the heath and fern ,— For I must say adieu — adieu to the winding banks of Erne !</p>

     <l n="5">The girls will bring their work and sing</l>
     <l n="6">beneath a twisted thorn ,</l>
     <l n="7">Or stray with sweethearts down the path</l>

    <head>ABBEY ASAROE</head>
    <head>Gray , gray is Abbey Asaroe , by Belashanny town , It has neither door nor window , the walls are broken down ; The carven-stones lie scatter 'd in briar and nettle-bed ; The only feet are those that come at burial of the dead . A little rocky rivulet runs murmuring to the tide , Singing a song of ancient days , in sorrow , not in pride ; The boortree and the lightsome ash across the portal grow , And heaven itself is now the roof of Abbey Asaroe .</head>
     <l n="1">It looks beyond the harbour-stream</l>
     <l n="2">to Gulban mountain blue ;</l>
     <l n="3">It hears the voice of Erna 's fall ,—</l>
     <l n="4">Atlantic breakers too ;</l>
     <l n="5">High ships go sailing past it ;</l>
     <l n="6">the sturdy clank of oars</l>
     <l n="7">Brings in the salmon-boat to haul</l>
     <l n="8">a net upon the shores ;</l>
     <l n="9">And this way to his home-creek ,</l>
     <l n="10">when the summer day is done ,</l>
     <l n="11">Slow sculls the weary fisherman</l>
     <l n="12">across the setting sun ;</l>
     <l n="13">While green with corn is Sheegus Hill ,</l>
     <l n="14">his cottage white below ;</l>
     <l n="15">But gray at every season</l>
     <l n="16">is Abbey Asaroe .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>There stood one day a poor old man above its broken bridge ; He heard no running rivulet , he saw no mountain-ridge ; He turn 'd his back on Sheegus Hill , and view 'd with misty sight The Abbey walls , the burial-ground with crosses ghostly white ; Under a weary weight of years he bow 'd upon his staff , Perusing in the present time the former 's epitaph ; For , gray and wasted like the walls , a figure full of woe , This man was of the blood of them who founded Asaroe .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">From Derry to Bundrowas Tower ,</l>
     <l n="2">Tirconnell broad was theirs ;</l>
     <l n="3">Spearmen and plunder , bards and wine ,</l>
     <l n="4">and holy abbot 's prayers ;</l>
     <l n="5">With chanting always in the house</l>
     <l n="6">which they had builded high</l>
     <l n="7">To God and to Saint Bernard ,—</l>
     <l n="8">where at last they came to die .</l>
     <l n="9">At worst , no workhouse grave for him !</l>
     <l n="10">the ruins of his race</l>
     <l n="11">Shall rest among the ruin 'd stones</l>
     <l n="12">of this their saintly place .</l>
     <l n="13">The fond old man was weeping ;</l>
     <l n="14">and tremulous and slow</l>
     <l n="15">Along the rough and crooked lane</l>
     <l n="16">he crept from Asaroe .</l>

    <head>A DREAM</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">I heard the dogs howl in the moonlight night ;</l>
     <l n="2">I went to the window to see the sight ;</l>
     <l n="3">All the Dead that ever I knew</l>
     <l n="4">Going one by one and two by two .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">On they pass 'd , and on they pass 'd ;</l>
     <l n="6">Townsfellows all , from first to last ;</l>
     <l n="7">Born in the moonlight of the lane ,</l>
     <l n="8">Quench 'd in the heavy shadow again .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">Schoolmates , marching as when we play 'd</l>
     <l n="10">At soldiers once — but now more staid ;</l>
     <l n="11">Those were the strangest sight to me</l>
     <l n="12">Who were drown 'd , I knew , in the awful sea .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">Straight and handsome folk ; bent and weak , too ;</l>
     <l n="14">Some that I loved , and gasp 'd to speak to ;</l>
     <l n="15">Some but a day in their churchyard bed ;</l>
     <l n="16">Some that I had not known were dead .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="17">A long , long crowd — where each seem 'd lonely ,</l>
     <l n="18">Yet of them all there was one , one only ,</l>
     <l n="19">Raised a head or look 'd my way :</l>
     <l n="20">She linger 'd a moment — she might not stay .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="21">How long since I saw that fair pale face !</l>
     <l n="22">Ah ! Mother dear ! might I only place</l>
     <l n="23">My head on thy breast , a moment to rest ,</l>
     <l n="24">While thy hand on my tearful cheek were prest !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="25">On , on , a moving bridge they made</l>
     <l n="26">Across the moon-stream , from shade to shade ,</l>
     <l n="27">Young and old , women and men ;</l>
     <l n="28">Many long-forgot , but remember 'd then .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="29">And first there came a bitter laughter ;</l>
     <l n="30">A sound of tears the moment after ;</l>
     <l n="31">And then a music so lofty and gay ,</l>
     <l n="32">That every morning , day by day ,</l>
     <l n="33">I strive to recall it if I may .</l>

   <p>THE ABBOT OF INNISFALLEN</p>
   <p>The Abbot of Innisfallen awoke ere dawn of day ; Under the dewy green leaves went he forth to pray . The lake around his island lay smooth and dark and deep , And wrapt in a misty stillness the mountains were all asleep . Low kneel 'd the Abbot Cormac when the dawn was dim and gray ; The prayers of his holy office he faithfully ‘ gan say . Low kneel 'd the Abbot Cormac while the dawn was waxing red ; And for his sins ’ forgiveness a solemn prayer he said : Low kneel 'd that holy Abbot while the dawn was waxing clear ; And he pray 'd with loving-kindness for his convent-brethren dear . Low kneel 'd that blessed Abbot while the dawn was waxing bright ; He pray 'd a great prayer for Ireland , he pray 'd with all his might . Low kneel 'd that good old Father while the sun began to dart ; He pray 'd a prayer for all men , he pray 'd it from his heart . His blissful soul was in Heaven , tho ’ a breathing man was he ; He was out of time 's dominion , so far as the living may be .</p>
   <p>The Abbot of Innisfallen arose upon his feet ; He heard a small bird singing , and O but it sung sweet ! It sung upon a holly-bush , this little snow-white bird ; A song so full of gladness he never before had heard . It sung upon a hazel , it sung upon a thorn ; He had never heard such music since the hour that he was born . It sung upon a sycamore , it sung upon a briar ; To follow the song and hearken this Abbot could never tire . Till at last he well bethought him ; he might no longer stay ; So he bless 'd the little white singing-bird , and gladly went his way .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">But , when he came to his Abbey ,</l>
     <l n="2">he found a wondrous change ;</l>
     <l n="3">He saw no friendly faces there ,</l>
     <l n="4">for every face was strange .</l>
     <l n="5">The strange men spoke unto him ;</l>
     <l n="6">and he heard from all and each</l>
     <l n="7">The foreign tongue of the Sassenach ,</l>
     <l n="8">not wholesome Irish speech .</l>
     <l n="9">Then the oldest monk came forward ,</l>
     <l n="10">in Irish tongue spake he :</l>
     <l n="11">‘ Thou wearest the holy Augustine 's dress ,</l>
     <l n="12">and who hath given it to thee ? ’</l>
     <l n="13">‘ I wear the Augustine 's dress ,</l>
     <l n="14">and Cormac is my name ,</l>
     <l n="15">The Abbot of this good Abbey</l>
     <l n="16">by grace of God I am .</l>
     <l n="17">I went forth to pray , at the dawn of day ;</l>
     <l n="18">and when my prayers were said ,</l>
     <l n="19">I hearken 'd awhile to a little bird ,</l>
     <l n="20">that sung above my head . ’</l>
     <l n="21">The monks to him made answer ,</l>
     <l n="22">‘ Two hundred years have gone o'er ,</l>
     <l n="23">Since our Abbot Cormac went through the gate ,</l>
     <l n="24">and never was heard of more .</l>
     <l n="25">Matthias now is our Abbot ,</l>
     <l n="26">and twenty have pass 'd away .</l>
     <l n="27">The stranger is lord of Ireland ;</l>
     <l n="28">we live in an evil day . ’</l>
     <l n="29">‘ Days will come and go , ’ he said ,</l>
     <l n="30">‘ and the world will pass away ,</l>
     <l n="31">In Heaven a day is a thousand years ,</l>
     <l n="32">a thousand years are a day . ’</l>
     <l n="33">‘ Now give me absolution ;</l>
     <l n="34">for my time is come , ’ said he .</l>
     <l n="35">And they gave him absolution ,</l>
     <l n="36">as speedily as might be .</l>
     <l n="37">Then , close outside the window ,</l>
     <l n="38">the sweetest song they heard</l>
     <l n="39">That ever yet since the world began</l>
     <l n="40">was utter 'd by any bird .</l>
     <l n="41">The monks look 'd out and saw the bird ,</l>
     <l n="42">its feathers all white and clean ;</l>
     <l n="43">And there in a moment , beside it ,</l>
     <l n="44">another white bird was seen .</l>
     <l n="45">Those two they sang together ,</l>
     <l n="46">waved their white wings , and fled ;</l>
     <l n="47">Flew aloft , and vanish 'd ;</l>
     <l n="48">but the good old man was dead .</l>
     <l n="49">They buried his blessed body</l>
     <l n="50">where lake and green-sward meet ;</l>
     <l n="51">A carven cross above his head ,</l>
     <l n="52">a holly-bush at his feet ;</l>
     <l n="53">Where spreads the beautiful water</l>
     <l n="54">to gay or cloudy skies ,</l>
     <l n="55">And the purple peaks of Killarney</l>
     <l n="56">from ancient woods arise .</l>

     <l n="19">As Day and Night and Day go by ;</l>
     <l n="20">And hoard June 's sun and April 's rain .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="21">Here fresh funeral tears were shed ;</l>
     <l n="22">Now the graves are also dead ;</l>

     <l n="24">While Day and Night and Day go by ;</l>
     <l n="25">And stars move calmly overhead .</l>
