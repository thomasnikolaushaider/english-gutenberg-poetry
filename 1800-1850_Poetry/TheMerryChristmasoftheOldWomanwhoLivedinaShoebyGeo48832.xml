    <p>REAR VIEW OF COPPER TOE SHOE HOUSE .</p>
   </figure>
   <p>NOTE .— This entertainment was prepared for a Sunday school 's Christmas Eve , and was arranged as follows : A stage , fourteen feet square , was fitted with a “ roll-up ” curtain in front . Drapery was hung at the sides and back ; a Christmas tree , filled with presents , was placed well back on the stage , and hidden by curtains arranged to separate in the middle . In front of these was placed “ Copper Toe Shoe House . ” The rear view represents the frame made of wood , in two pieces , to separate in the middle , of the following dimensions : ten feet from toe to heel , five feet and one half from heel to top , four feet and one half across top , heel about twenty inches long , eight inches high . Cover front , in two separate sections , with black cambric ; for toe , copper tinsel paper ; for sole and patch , brown cambric ; for buckle , silver tinsel paper ; the patch fastened only at bottom . A curtain , of same material or color as back stage , should be hung in rear of shank , that children standing behind may not be seen . A settee is placed behind it , on which the children in the dwelling stand . 1 , 2 , and 3 lie upon the stage , and stick their heads out when required . The characters can pass between the curtains at back , to their places . When the tree is disclosed , all the characters are in front , the settee is removed , the braces unfastened , and , at a signal , two boys run off the shoe , and others draw the curtains .</p>
