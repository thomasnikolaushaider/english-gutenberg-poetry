    <head>PREFACE .</head>
    <p n="1">THE five favourite fairy legends which M. Gustave Dore has illustrated are so well known , have been so often told , and in so many different ways , that it was a matter of no small difficulty to determine the best mode of treating them . The plan I have adopted is to give the tales in a simple metre and in the most unpretending manner , going , in short , little if anything beyond mere recital in easy verse . From performing even this plain task as I could have wished I have been prevented by ill health , and I fear that what I have written little deserves the honour of association with works of genius like M. Gustave Dore 's pictures . But I have the single satisfaction of knowing that I have done the best I could .</p>

     <item>THE SLEEPING BEAUTY .</item>
     <item>IN that strange region , dim and grey ,</item>
     <item>Which lies so very far away ,</item>
     <item>Whose chronicles in prose or rhyme Are dated “ Once upon a time , ”</item>
     <item>There was a land where silence reigned So deep ,— the ear it almost pained To hear the gnat 's shrill clarion blow , -  Though he Sleep 's herald is we know .</item>
     <item>Scarce would you deem that calm profound , Unbroken by the ghost of sound ,</item>
     <item>Had , like a sudden curtain , dropt Upon a revel , instant stopt ,—</item>
     <item>That laugh and shout and merry rout And hunting song had all died out ,</item>
     <item>Stricken to silence at a touch —</item>
     <item>A single touch ! It was not much !</item>
     <item>I ‘ ll tell you how it came about .</item>
     <item>What bevies of pages Of various ages Princess Prettipet 's christening banquet engages !</item>
     <item>They all look as deeply important as sages .</item>
     <item>What hundreds of cooks !</item>
     <item>To judge by their looks ,</item>
     <item>They had written the very profoundest of books .</item>
     <item>( Of course , books like those by Hobbes , Bacon , or Hooker I Mean — not mere Kitchener 's Essays on Cookery . )</item>
     <item>l</item>
     <item>As to the cartes ,</item>
     <item>From the soups to the tarts ,</item>
     <item>‘ T would need to detail them a man of some parts ; While to eat of each item —</item>
     <item>To taste — just to bite ‘ em ,</item>
     <item>The veracious voracious will own would affright ‘ em .</item>
     <item>If you want to find out The amount , or about ,</item>
     <item>Of the salmon , beef , partridges , lobsters , sourcrout ,</item>
     <item>Maccaroni , potatoes , cream , cutlets , ice , trout ,</item>
     <item>Lamb , blanc-mange , kippered herring , duck , brocoli sprout , Sheep 's trotters , real turtle , tripe , truffles , swine 's snout ,</item>
     <item>Sole au gratin , snails , birds ’ nests , Dutch cheese , whiting-pout , Jelly , plovers ’ eggs , bitters , liqueurs , ale , wine , stout ,</item>
     <item>Peas , cheese , fricassees , and ragout — ( say ragout For the sake of the rhyme ) —</item>
     <item>And have plenty of time ,</item>
     <item>And a knowledge of figures ( which I call a crime ) , Because it 's a feat that would puzzle beginners — Make out and declare The cube of the square ,</item>
     <item>Of twice twenty thousand of Lord Mayor 's grand dinners .</item>
     <item>#####</item>
     <item>The invited guests begin to arrive :</item>
     <item>With nobles and courtiers the scene is alive .</item>
     <item>They hustle ,</item>
     <item>And bustle ,</item>
     <item>In rich dresses rustle ;</item>
     <item>The squeeze for good places is almost a tussle ;</item>
     <item>Precedence depends not on birth , but on muscle .</item>
     <item>But they 're none of them able To reach the high table ,</item>
     <item>For the grave Major-Domo , perceiving the Babel ,</item>
     <item>A sufficient space clears With the King 's Musqueteers ,</item>
     <item>Because he well knows it will cost him his ears If — when the time comes for the soups and the meats — The twelve fairy godmothers cannot find seats .</item>
     <item>At last there 's a bray Of trumpets , to say That His Majesty 's Majesty 's coming this way ,</item>
     <item>With his Ministers all in their gorgeous array ,</item>
     <item>And the Lords of his Council , a noble display ,</item>
     <item>And the Queen , who 's as beauteous as blossoms in May , With her Ladies in Waiting so smiling and gay ,</item>
     <item>With a great many more I might briefly run o'er If at pageants like this I were only au fait .</item>
     <item>The glittering procession Makes stately progression To the seats that the Musqueteers hold in possession At the top of the hall ;</item>
     <item>While the visitors all Are crowded to death , though the place is not small ,</item>
     <item>But from wall unto wall</item>
     <item>Crammed with short folks and tall ,</item>
     <item>Who , as chances befall ,</item>
     <item>And in various degrees They suffer the squeeze ,</item>
     <item>bawl , brawl , haul , maul , squall , call , fall , crawl , and sprawl</item>
     <item>The King 's looking pleasant ,</item>
     <item>Expecting a present —</item>
     <item>Say knives , forks , and spoons that cost many a bezant —</item>
     <item>For his daughter and heiress From each of the fairies ;</item>
     <item>( A fay for a sponsor in these days quite rare is ! )</item>
     <item>But fairies , we ’ know ,</item>
     <item>Have gifts to bestow More precious than silver and gold ones — and so One gives the babe beauty ,</item>
     <item>Another gives health ,</item>
     <item>This a strong sense of duty ,</item>
     <item>That plenty of wealth .</item>
     <item>Five , six , seven , eight , nine , ten Add their presents , but when Eleven have endowed her , the last of the dozen Says , “ I really do n't know what to give her , dear cousin ( Addressing the Queen ,)</item>
     <item>“ But the courses between I shall hit upon something . I will not be mean ; So pray take your seats , for I 'm not such a sinner As , while I am thinking , to keep you from dinner ! ”</item>
     <item>The King has taken the highest place ,</item>
     <item>Beside him the Queen in her diamonds and lace .</item>
     <item>Each fairy godmother Sits down by another ,</item>
     <item>And my lord the Archbishop is just saying grace ,</item>
     <item>When in comes a cook , with a very white face ,</item>
     <item>Who cries , as he straight up the hall rushes nimbly ,</item>
     <item>“ Please your Majesty , somebody 's fell down the chimbley !</item>
     <item>There 's silence in the hall For half a minute ,</item>
     <item>And not a word doth fall From those within it ;</item>
     <item>When , lo ! — No ! — And yet it is so !</item>
     <item>The sound of a foot comes heavy and slow Up the staircase from down below ;</item>
     <item>And a figure ill-grown ,</item>
     <item>Unattended , alone ,</item>
     <item>Walks straight through the guests to the foot of the throne , And then with a squeak Rising into a shriek ,</item>
     <item>And eyes that with fury are terribly glistening ,</item>
     <item>Cries , “ Pray , sir , why was not I asked to the christening ? ”</item>
     <item>‘ T was old Fairy Spite ,</item>
     <item>Whom they did not invite ,</item>
     <item>Because of her manners , which were not polite .</item>
     <item>She led a bad life ,</item>
     <item>Was addicted to strife ,</item>
     <item>And besides — worst of all — she ate peas with a knife ! But ‘ twas really no joke Her wrath to provoke .</item>
     <item>So in hopes to appease her His Majesty spoke ,</item>
     <item>And said , sore affrighted ,</item>
     <item>“ They both were delighted To see her that day —</item>
     <item>Quite charmed — in fact , they Could n't think how it was she had not been invited !</item>
     <item>Shrieked Spite , “ Silence , gaby !</item>
     <item>Let 's look at the baby . ”</item>
     <item>The Queen , in a tremble ,</item>
     <item>Her fears to dissemble ,</item>
     <item>Said , Here is the darling — papa she 'll resemble .</item>
     <item>You 'd like , p'rhaps , to take her ,</item>
     <item>But please not to wake her ,</item>
     <item>She sleeps . ” “ Sleeps ! ” said Spite , “ does she really ? I ‘ ll make her</item>
     <item>Of sleep , ma'am , have plenty ”</item>
     <item>( Here — “ Chorus “ Attente ! ” )*</item>
     <item>“ If she touches a spindle before she is twenty !</item>
     <item>“ For if she does , a heavy sleep Shall over all your palace creep ,</item>
     <item>And you , with your whole court , shall keep Buried in leaden fetters deep ! "</item>
     <item>“ Until ” — here Fairy Number Twelve ,</item>
     <item>Who , as we know , was forced to shelve Her gift because the banquet waited ,</item>
     <item>Broke in and capped what Spite had stated —</item>
     <item>“ Until a prince shall come to wake The Sleeping Beauty , and so break The spell wherewith old Spite in vain Would her young life for aye enchain ! ”</item>
     <item>#####</item>
     <item>The King sent heralds through the land Proclaiming spindles contraband ,</item>
     <item>Pronouncing penalties and pains</item>
     <item>‘ Gainst distaffs , treadles , rocks , and skeins .</item>
     <item>And so to spin Became a sin ;</item>
     <item>Wheels were bowled out , and looms came in .</item>
     <item>No more old women were allowed to meddle</item>
     <item>With wheel or treadle ;</item>
     <item>There were no spinsters left , the fair deceivers</item>
     <item>All became weavers ;</item>
     <item>* The passage I quote in this wild dithyramb you 'll assuredly find in Act I. of “ Sonnambula . ”</item>
     <item>The very name and uses of a spindle</item>
     <item>To nought did dwindle ;</item>
     <item>The fashion was , folks said ,</item>
     <item>Entirely dead ,</item>
     <item>Expired — past human effort to re-kindle .</item>
     <item>Time 's wonted pace Is not a rapid race ;</item>
     <item>His motto seems to be “ Festina lente . ”</item>
     <item>But yet he passed away ,</item>
     <item>Until at length the day -</item>
     <item>Approached on which the Princess would be twenty .</item>
     <item>What consultations !</item>
     <item>What preparations !</item>
     <item>What busy times for people of all stations !</item>
     <item>What scouring out of rooms With mops and brooms !</item>
     <item>What scouring to and fro of hurried grooms !</item>
     <item>No leisure , not the least ,</item>
     <item>For man or beast ,</item>
     <item>Because His Majesty had fixed a feast —</item>
     <item>Acres of eatables and seas of ale ,</item>
     <item>A banquet that should make all others pale ,</item>
     <item>E'en those of Heliogabalus , deceased —</item>
     <item>To celebrate the day his child was quite Beyond the malice of old Fairy Spite !</item>
     <item>It was a scene of bustle and intrusion ,</item>
     <item>And vast profusion —</item>
     <item>Such game , and meat , and fish , and rare confections !</item>
     <item>The tables and the chairs Down - and up-stairs Were packed away — piled up in all directions ,</item>
     <item>In chaos , which the master of a house Whose want of nous</item>
     <item>Is such that he allows his wife a soiree ,</item>
     <item>Discovers round him , when tired out and sorry ,</item>
     <item>He fain would sleep , but cannot for the din doze —</item>
     <item>In short , that plague , “ a house turned out of windows . ”</item>
     <item>No wonder the Princess , so meek and quiet ,</item>
     <item>Should run away from all the dust and riot .</item>
     <item>No wonder , I repeat ,</item>
     <item>When all the suite ,</item>
     <item>From the Great Seal to her who made the beds ,</item>
     <item>Were hardly sure if they were on their heads ,</item>
     <item>Or on their feet !</item>
     <item>No wonder the Princess — no soul aware ,</item>
     <item>Even of those who had her in their care —</item>
     <item>Stole from her room , and up a winding stair ,</item>
     <item>Up to the highest turret 's tipmost top ,</item>
     <item>Without or let or stop ,</item>
     <item>Went to enjoy the scenery and air !</item>
     <item>In a room at the top of the tower that day</item>
     <item>Merrily , merrily turned the wheel ! An old dame span , with never a stay ,</item>
     <item>Merrily , merrily turned the wheel ! The wool was as white as the driven snow ,</item>
     <item>Merrily , merrily turned the wheel ! And she sang , “ Merrily , merrily , oh !</item>
     <item>Merrily turn the wheel ! "</item>

     <p>Merrily , merrily turned the wheel !— “ What bonny white wool , and what bonny white thread ! " Merrily , merrily turned the wheel ! “ Come hither , then , fair one , and make the wheel go ! " Merrily , merrily turned the wheel ! Said ugly old Spite , who sang , “ Merrily , oh ! Merrily turn the wheel ! " She turns the wheel and wakes its busy hum , She twists the white wool with her whiter fingers ; She hears them call her , but she will not come : Charmed with the toy , in that small room she lingers . The wheel runs swiftly and the distaff 's full , She takes the spindle — heedless of who calls her . Two tiny drops of blood fall on the wool , And all that cruel Spite foretold befalls her ! On one and all Did sudden slumber fall ! The steed that in the palace courtyard cropt — The very bird upon the roof that hopt — The cook who mincemeat for the banquet chopt —? The gardener who the fruit tree 's branches lopt — The huntsman who his beaded forehead mopt — The gay young lover who the question popt — The damsel who thereat her eyelids dropt — The councillor who fain the state had propt — The King , his measures anxious to adopt — The courtier in his new court suit be-fopt — The toper who his beak in Rhenish sopt — The scullion wiping up the sauce he slopt — The chamberlain , as wise as ancient Copt — The purblind peer who 'd in the fountain flopt — The jester who that fall with mirth had topt — Stopt ! And over all there came a change ; A silence terrible and strange Enwrapt the place : While thickets dense of thorn and brier Grew round it till the topmost spire They did efface . And only aged crones came nigh To gather sticks ; or , passing by , Some huntsman bold , Spying a tower , would ask its tale , And by the shepherds scared and pale Would then be told — How many a prince of noble blood Had striven to penetrate the wood , And reach the keep Where that Princess so passing fair , With King and Queen and courtiers there , Lay wrapt in sleep . But how none ever yet could make A path through that thick-tangled brake — And none came back , But perished miserably there , And left their bones all bleached and bare In that dark track ! It was a solemn place , I ween , Wrapt in its shroud of sombre green , So hushed and still ; The fall of every leaf you heard , Nor was there in its shades a bird To cheep and trill . No cricket chirped beneath the hedge — No reed-wren rustled in the sedge — No skylark soared ; Only at times , where round the keep Did thickest snaky ivies creep , A grey owl snored . The sunlight slumbered on the wall ; The tranced shadow did not crawl , Or scarcely crept ; Dreaming the white lake-lilies lay Above their image , still as they ; The hushed wave slept ; Like hermits dozing in their cells , Drowsed in the drooping blossom-bells The murmurous bees ; All languidly the land up-clomb Around the central palace dome By slow degrees .</p>

     <p>028 ] But that embowered pile did seem A cloud from some fantastic dream —</p>
    </figure>
    <epigraph>
     <p>Some visioned place : Its towers were clothed in misty sheen , And slumbering forests seemed to lean About its base . The branches nodded , and the breeze Sighed ceaseless through the sleepy trees , A long-drawn breath : Nature 's warm pulses here seemed stayed , Steeped in a trance that all dismayed , ‘ T was so like death ! Only for ever grew and spread The sombre branches overhead , Thick leaf and bloom ; As if to make for Nature 's sleep The brooding silence still more deep — More deep the gloom ! Into the heart a terror sank : The vegetation lush and rank On all sides ran , And looped and drooped in bine and twine ; And never trace or track or sign Of living man ! ##### Down by the river that runs through the wood The horns are gaily winding . Tra-la-la-la ! That music good Denotes the red deer 's finding ! Tra-la-la-la ! La-la ! la-la ! The echoes repeat The music sweet That tells of the red deer 's finding ! Over the river and over the plain , Through forest , vale , and hollow ! Tra-la-la-la ! That note again Bids all good huntsmen follow . Tra-la-la-la ! La-la ! la-la ! The sweet notes fail Along the gale , Then , all good huntsmen , follow ! By many a mile of moorland vast , By many a mile of forest — Tra-la-la-la !— the huntsman 's blast Tells where the chase is sorest . Tra-la-la-la ! La-la ! la-la ! Oh , hapless deer , Thy fate is near , Which vainly thou deplorest . In vain the flying quarry seeks The dark wood 's friendly branches : The chase is done — its race is run , The dogs are at its haunches . The Prince looks back . He rides alone , His suite no longer follow , And he can hear no friendly cheer In answer to his holloa ! What a chase ! What a race ! What a terrible pace ! He 's outridden his friends . It 's a very queer case — Where can he have got ? What 's the name of the place He ‘ ll never be able his steps to retrace ! He pulls up his steed , Not too early , indeed , For the poor beast is finished , it shakes like a reed . If his home lay quite near , And he knew where to steer , . His horse could not carry him there — that is clear . Meanwhile each lengthening shadow shows That day is drawing to a close . In two more hours the glowing sun Will down the western heavens run , And quench its glories manifold In yon bright sea of molten gold . Before him that dense thicket vast and dim Spreads out its awful silence and seclusion , And none is near to tell its tale to him And scare intrusion . On either side his path a giant bole Rears its huge form , a rude gigantic column . That gloomy portal does not fill his soul With fancies solemn . His step is light on the luxuriant sod , From the green blades a thousand dew-drops spurning . Little he dreams that path has ne'er been trod By foot returning . Heedless he views the dark nooks in the glades , Passing to spots that shafts of sunlight brighten — Nor knows that human bones within those shades Are laid to whiten . For him there is no terror in the spot , No hint of deaths to which it interest sad owes ; For him no spectres its bright sunshine blot , Or fill its shadows . For him the secret of that grove profound Is locked away — that tragic tale , and tearful . To him the death-like calm that reigns around Is strange , not fearful . So on he fares , through sunshine and through shade , By paths that ne'er before were trod by mortal , To where the dusky forest 's green arcade Leads to a portal . Along that silent avenue the young Prince gaily passes , ‘ T is carpeted with velvet moss beneath the nodding grasses . The dreamy sunlight through the boughs upon the green sward streaming , Sets here and there with radiance rare a lingering dew-drop gleaming . On either hand rise lofty stems ; above , the branches mingle ; And , as a glimpse of blue shuts in the end of some green dingle , Framed in an arch of greenery where that long alley closes He sees a flight of steps , a gate o'ergrown with truant roses , And some one who beside the gate in that warm sunshine dozes .</p>

     <p>Was ever there found A sleeper so sound ? He thumps him and shakes him , But that never wakes him ; Not kick , tweak , or pinch Can stir him an inch . I do n't think he 'd stir if you gave him a - big — An immoderate slice of the coldest “ cold pig . ” Cried the Prince , leaping o'er The page , “ Qu'il s'endort ! ” So he left that inveterate sleeper to snore While he ventured on farther the place to explore . “ ‘ T is a very fine place As one clearly may trace — Though , by Jove , ” said the Prince , and he made a wry face , “ From the dirt that 's about , it do n't seem they can muster So much as a Turk 's head , or dust-brush , or duster ! It 's quite an inch thick : Oh , would n't I lick The minions for playing this slovenly trick , If I were the owner , and had a big stick ! Look ! with curtains of velvet and carpets of plush , rooms — And yet the floor 's covered with toadstools and mushrooms ! It 's well for the parlour-maid she 'd not beside her This child , when she left that great cobweb and spider . It 's evident cleanliness is n't their hobby ! " With these words the Prince reached the end of the lobby . From the lobby he passed to the guard-room , and thence To the courtyard and gardens , which both were immense . The palace , he sees , ? Lies back beyond these , Apparently rather too darkened by trees — They 're not trees though he finds , bringing closer his peepers , But ivy and woodbine and other quick creepers , Which with no interference of gardeners to “ worret , ” Have climbed to the roof of the loftiest turret . How those creepers have turned and twirled , Twisted , wandered , rambled , and curled ! Such a place , I ween , Had never been seen — From basement to roof in such greenery furled — Throughout the whole inhabited world . Not even that building , so widely known For its want of proportion — That vast abortion , The Exhibition of ‘ Sixty-two , Though quite a monstrosity to the view , Seemed half so “ overgrown . ”</p>

     <p>040 ] Swift across the court Now the young Prince trips , Sees around a sallyport Hounds asleep in slips ; Huntsmen bold , returned from sport , All prepared to blow a mort , Snoring , horns to lips ! There they were becalmed , like ships Lying with all sail outspread , Lifeless on an ocean dead . He draws near : there is no one to bar his way , E'en the steeds are too sleepy to utter a “ nay , ” While each single hound In the pack , I ‘ ll be bound , Is so sound there 's no chance of his making a sound , Though not wanting in bark , since he 's closely bound round With branches of creepers ;— but then they are boughs That are not of the sort to be followed by “ wows . ” One huntsman would have an ugly fall If he were not upheld by the palace wall , Whence a stray branch of woodbine , in pitying scorn for him , Has thrown out a trailer that 's winding his horn for him . Another one , dropt Off soundly , is propt By a buttress that stands where his steed by chance stopt . An odd pillow , I vow ; For you ‘ ll surely allow That unless of some slumber your need is the utt'rest , A sleep on a buttress seems anything but rest . Two men in the doorway Appear in a poor way ,</p>

     <p>So closely they 're bound And wound Around ; Their feet in fetters , their temples crowned By the snake-like stems in their various inclinings , That they must appear To the Prince , I fear , Sleeping partners in some branch department of Twining 's . Past grooms as unawakened as sad sinners , Past screws of hunters sound as Derby winners , Past hounds as fast — no less — As the express , Through Bedfordshire into the land of Nod , The young Prince trod , And on through corridors and long arcades , Halls wrapt in sombre shades , And anterooms wherein had Echo slept So long , it scarce awakened as he stept Lightly and swiftly o'er The dusty floor , That sadly stood in need of being swept . And ever and anon , As he passed on , In room , in hall , on stair , Here , there , and everywhere , He came on sleepers sleeping with the air Of folks at active work by sleep o'ertaken , Whom nothing could awaken ; Not even being — like physic with a sediment That to its being swallowed 's an impediment — Well shaken ! The housemaid , seemingly in fuss and fluster , Tripping downstairs with feather-broom and duster , Caught unaware Upon the bottom stair By sudden slumber , had quite failed to muster Sufficient sense to rouse herself to any stir , And so lay dozing up against the banister . A lacquey , carrying upstairs the coal-scuttle , Had fallen napping , and let fall the whole scuttle ; A giddy page Was , with another youngster of his age , Playing at fly-the-garter in , the hall When both asleep did fall — One Going to take a run , Straining to start ( as when is trained a pup — any Pointer or sporting dog — and there gets up any Partridge or pheasant , in the slip he ‘ ll strain ) , The other of the twain Had fallen asleep w'hile tucking in his twopenny ! Within their barracks several of the guards Were quarrelling in their slumber over cards ; The butler in the cellar at the tap Was taking such a nap , He 'd filled his silver flagon o'er and o'er , And let the wine run all about the floor Until the cask was drained and held no more . But he 'd continued after that to snore , Until he was as dusted And cobwebbed and encrusted As rare old port , bottled in ‘ Thirty-four .</p>

     <p>044 ] All these the Prince passed by with stealthy tread As on he sped , Until he reached the grandest room of all , The banquet-hall , Where on the board a mighty feast was spread . But since the day when first that cloth was laid Time had strange havoc made With dish and dainty on the board arrayed ; Had played strange tricks With those — some five or six — People of station Who had been favoured with an invitation To dinner with the ruler of the nation ; In short , to no conclusion harsh to jump , any Person of taste Had thought the King disgraced , Not only by his room , but by his company . Vast mushrooms , spawn of hideous dreams , Had quickened in the rotting seams , And dusty cobwebs huge , Wherein did bloated spiders lie , And feign to sleep , were hung on high ; But there was neither gnat nor fly</p>

     <p>To catch by subterfuge . The very mice had fallen asleep That ventured in that hall to creep . And where the sun athwart the gloom Poured through the pane A glittering lane Like Dreamland 's golden bridge , You looked for stir of life in vain , Because the very midge Slept in that drowsy room , As silent as the tomb ! The King — with half-way to his lips the beaker , And head half turning to the latest speaker — Presiding o'er his banquet , slumbered there-amid . Like the first Pharaoh sleeping in his pyramid ; While the Prime Minister , acute and wise , Still saw what must be done with fast-shut eyes , And , as behoved him in the royal presence , Kept nodding to his Sovereign acquiescence . The Treasurer and Chancellor of Exchequer Was bolt upright , as trim as a three-decker . For raising coin and borrowing he was meant , And nobody could ever say he leant To right or left , E'en when of sense bereft . The Secretary , Foreign and Domestic , Upright did less stick , And , being long accustomed to indite , Inclined to right . Beside the door a sentry Stood like the Roman soldier in the entry Discovered in the ruins of Pompeii , ( Or Herculaneum — which was't ? You see , I Have got no book of reference at all Here in the country , not e'en what we 'll call , For sake of rhyme , a classical invent'ry ) . At any rate , he stood There like a thing of wood ; And by his side did stand , Salver in hand , A servitor whose duty was to cater With flagons , flasks , and bowls For all the thirsty souls — ( He 's called a buttery-man at Alma Mater ) — Well ! There this lad of liquor Remained a sticker Against the stair-foot , with his laden tray Of claret , sherry , Burgundy , Tokay , And other wines we ‘ ll call et caetera — Just like a very image or dumb-waiter . Another ‘ mid the goblets lay a-sprawl — It made the young Prince think Him overcome with drink , Which really had not been the case ‘ at all . O ercome he was there 's no denying , but ‘ T was only sleep ; for though the glass was cut , He was not even blown — He could have shown He did not owe to any drop his fall . Through every tiny crevice , nook , and cranny , Heaven knows how many Of every kind of creeping plant had sprouted And grown and wandered since , Till the young Prince If he were in — or out — of doors half doubted . The clinging tendrils , Which Nature ( as an officer his men drills ) Had taught to turn one way , enwound and bound The silent sleepers who all slept so sound . One trailer formed a sort of chain between The foremost Maid of Honour and the Queen , As if to say To those who sleeping lay , “ It 's time to rise , good sirs , and go away ” — In short , the very same remark that made is By stingy hosts who save their wines by dint Of the discourteous hint , “ Come , do n't you think it 's time to join the laclies ? ” The young Prince gazed Upon the scene amazed . He shouted ; not a single head was raised — No single sound upon the silence broke — Nobody spoke — All heads alike were bowed . He shouted loud As one who wishes to outroar a crowd ; But not a word He heard — No creature stirred : The situation really seemed absurd . There lay the feast Untouched for years at least ; And though they 'd sat so long , Not one of all the throng -  Of feeding seemed inclined to be beginner , And there was the young Prince , Dropt in some minutes since , And making such a din Since he 'd come in , That he became for them another dinner . At last tired out , Of vain attempts by shout , And even shake , to rout From their deep sleep the slumberers about The banquet-table ,— Whether he 'd be able Ever to wake them , feeling quite in doubt , The Prince made up his mind To leave them all behind , And see if some one waking he could find , And so passed on through halls and quiet cloisters , But everywhere found people mute as oysters And sound as tops . But yet he never stops , Though neither man nor woman , girl nor boy stirs . All is as still as death , And not a breath Stirs the ancestral banners or the arras ; No page 's voice or groom 's Heard in the rooms , No maid 's shrill tongue the listener 's ear to harass ; No step upon the stair , No footfall anywhere , Not e'en on what Jane Housemaid calls the tarrace . But still the Prince his onward course pursued , Half fearing to intrude , As each fresh chamber doubtfully he stept in . In tiring-rooms he views The ladies ’ maids so tired they ‘ re in a snooze . Then for a change Through sleeping-rooms he ‘ ll range , Which by some contradiction very strange Appear the only rooms that are not slept in . Yet onward still he strays All undecided , And yet his steps are guided ; For round his head on airy pinion plays A band of Fays , Who lead him forward still by devious ways , To where the Sleeping Beauty lies , O'er whose tender violet eyes For such years the lids have closed , On her couch while she reposed . “ Come away ! ” sang each Fay , “ Now we hail the happy day When the Prince shall break the spell Spoken by old Spite the fell . Now sing we merrily , For the destined one is he ! " Thus all gladly sung the Fays , Though he could not hear their lays , Wandering on as in a maze . Last he reached a silent chamber , Where through all the woodbine 's clamber , And the roses ’ red profusion , And the jasmine 's silver stars , Glowed the glorious sun 's intrusion — Misty golden bars , Touching all with amber . ’ But — or e'er that room he entered Where the magic all was centred , For a space , in wonder , dumbly Gazed he on that figure comely Sleeping in the snowy bed , Where the sunshine splendour shed From the casement 's pictured pane Crimson , blue , and yellow stain In a variegated rain . ( Not all colours , as we know , That in painted windows glow Can the sun contrive to throw — Primal tints , red , yellow , indigo , Will , however , through a “ windy ” go . ) One moment on the threshold — One moment and no more ! So like a thing of dreams And Fairyland she seems , That he must pause till time his breath restore , And he of life take fresh hold — One moment and no more — And then across the room he bounded To that white bed by clustering bloom surrounded — Across the startled floor , Whence foot had been estranged so long before , The frightened echoes that his step awoke Seemed shrieking out to hear when silence broke ! In her bed , as white as snow , Softly had she slumbered , While old Time with silent flow Had the long years numbered . Quiet as the dead she lay , Sleeping all those years away On her pillow , woodbine-cumbered , Wreathed with flowering may . And her breath so softly slips Through the rosy-tinted lips , That the white lace seems to rest Moveless on her whiter breast — That it scarce appears to stir One of all the fluttering motes That , in love to look at her , Glitter down the golden lanes That the sun pours through the panes , Bright with armonr-coats .</p>

     <p>052 ] Drawn by her sweet lips ’ perfume , As a bee to golden broom , When the braes are all in bloom , Stole the Prince across the room . Every step he nearer set , Oped the eyes of violet — Oped a little — wider yet !— Till the white lids , quite asunder , Showed the beauties hidden under — Showed the soft eyes , full of wonder , Opening , towards him turned — Till their radiance bent upon him From his trance of marvel won him ; And his bosom burned With the passion to outpour All his soul her feet before , Careless if she spurned , So that he might only tell That he loved her — and how well ! Now through the palace woke the stir of life ; Both fork and knife Were in the banquet-hall with vigour plied , While far and wide Awoke so great a riot after the quiet , It seemed as if the household was at strife . Girl , woman , boy , and man Bustled about and ran — All hurried , not one plodding ! Because , you see , Each thought that he or she Had been the only one that had been nodding , And , fearful of detection , Was bound to strive and look alive , In order to escape correction . Meanwhile the red sun set . And yet The household did not into order get : All was surprise and wonder , Error and blunder . The fire was out , the cook was in a pet , The feast was cold , the Queen was in a fret ; The hunters just returned , they thought , from hunting , Felt it affronting Their game should get so very high and mite-y ; The housemaid , seeing all the dust and dirt , Felt hurt , It drove her almost crazy — at least flighty . But over all this din and turmoil soon Uprose the silver moon , And by its rays shed on the dewy grass , Forth from the palace that young pair did pass , And threaded the deep shades In the arcades Of sombre forests that around them lay . And so they took their way To Fairyland , wherein , as legends say , ‘ Mid mirth and merry-making , song and laughter , They married , living happy ever after — And there , I 'm told , they ‘ re living to this day ! LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD . BY the side of a wood A cottage once stood , Where a little girl dwelt , who wore a red hood . Her father of trees in the forest was cutter , And her mother sold poultry , milk , eggs , cream , and butter . The little red hood , It must be understood , Belonged to a mantle — as pretty and proper a cloak As e'er you set eyes on :— in short , a red opera cloak . But operas ne'er , that I am aware , Had been heard of by any one dwelling round there ; Whereas every dame had a cloak bright as flame That she wore when out riding ( which gave it its name . ) For then in those parts They 'd no chaises , spring-carts , Gigs , or waggonettes , such as a farmer now starts ; So Hodge , Reuben , or Giles , Went his eight or ten miles By the road — or the bridle path , dodging the stiles — On his nag , grey or brown , to the next market town . And were you to meet him , I 'd bet you a crown You would certainly find him ( If your sight 's not , like mine , dim ,) A-jogging along with the goodwife behind him , Perched up on the pillion of Dobbin or Dapple , With a cloak like a poppy and cheeks like an apple :— A cloak with a hood , that was really some good , For use , not for ornament — one that you could ( That is , if you would ) Draw over your face quite closely , in case The sun was too warm or the rain fell apace ,— A both-ears-protecting , eyes-shading , hair-hiding hood . And that 's why they called the child Little Red Riding Hood . By the side of the cot where Red Riding Hood dwelt Was a garden , surrounded by trees ; The flowers were the sweetest that ever were smelt , And were greatly beloved by the bees , Who led jolly lives In a couple of hives Well sheltered from shower and from breeze . Beyond the small garden , whose flowers were so sweet Bees wooed them through long summer days , The woodman had cleared a small patch for the wheat That , as each year came round , he would raise , To grind and to bake For bread and for cake —— Simple wheat , not that wonder , a maize ! Now the sun rises and the world awakes , For morning — like a careless servant — breaks ; And from house , hut , and cot , Hind , farmer , or what not , Each villager his way to labour takes . Each stride he makes a thousand dew-drops shakes From off the fresh green grass they were besprinkling , And makes them wink , And gleam , and glance , and blink , Until the peasant in great haste you think Because he walks the whole way in a twinkling . Red Riding Hood 's father has shouldered his axe , And is off to the woods again . At the thwacks and the cracks as the timber he hacks The echoing shades complain ; But woe to the stem that his steel attacks , For its murmurs are all in vain . Red Riding Hood 's mother has risen with day , As soon as the hens were awake , And down to the kitchen has taken her way , From the hearth all the embers to rake , And the butter and flour on the table to lay , For she 's bent upon making a cake . But little Red Riding Hood 's slumbering yet — She is terribly lazy , I fear ; For little folks up in the morning should get As soon as the light becomes clear , And not sleep away The best time of the day , Which is six , or about :— as I hear . When the cake 's nice and brown The young lady comes down , In her little white apron and little blue gown ; Has for breakfast a bowl of fresh milk from the cow , And when she has finished , her mother says , “ Now , Just slip on your cloak , dear , as quick as you can ; I Want you to carry some things to your granny ! " Red Riding Hood 's drest , And , looking her best , Is only awaiting her mother 's behest . On the table is laid The cake that was made Ere Red Riding Hood opened her eyes , I 'm afraid , And beside it a pot Whose equal could not At Fortnum and Mason 's be easily got ; For , as every one tells me , fine fragrant fresh honey Is not always obtainable , even for money . [ There are very few treats in the matter of sweets , Like the honey one fresh from the honeycomb eats . But fond as I am of a little fresh honey , I can n't watch the bees in their wanderings sunny Without a great risk of a painful disaster , Though I think it would trouble the famous “ Beemaster ” ( As his real name 's a secret , we ‘ ll say Dr. Thingamy ) To explain to a “ fellah , ” Qui tam amat viella , How it is that the bees make an object to sting o ’ me . )</p>

     <p>“ Little Red Riding Hood , child of mine , ” . Said the mother to her daughter , . “ Through the forest of beeches , and larches , and pine , And down by the pool of water , And over the fields to your grandmother 's cot With the griddle-cake and the honey-pot , Go , and tell her what you have brought her . But — mind what I say — do not delay To chatter with folks or pick flowers on the way ! ” Little Red Riding Hood promised her mother She 'd not stop on the road to do one or the other . “ Such allurements I old enough now to withstand am , So I ‘ ll carry the honey and cake to my grandam , And then you shall see how quick I can be . Good bye , dearest mother ! ” And off hurried she . The fields with buttercups are gold , The hedges white with may ; The woodbine 's trumpets manifold Are bright beside the way ; The foxglove rears its lofty spire Where hang the purple bells ; In shady quiet nooks retire The modest pimpernels ; The poppy the green corn-fields decks , The meads are bright with cowslips . She loiters on her way , nor recks How rapidly time now slips . She enters now a glade , Dappled with light and shade , Through which the path is to her grandam 's made ; And as she strolls along , Singing her careless song , She meets a grim grey wolf . She 's not afraid , Because close by She hears her father ply His axe , and knows he 'd to the rescue fly If Master Wolf should any treason try . And Master Wolf knows too it would not do , Although it 's hard with such a meal in view ; And so most laudably He makes himself quite pleasant , For the present , Albeit his stomach 's crying “ cupboard ” audibly . “ What a nice cloak of scarlet ! How pretty you are ! Let Me carry that cake or that very big jar :— let Me carry it , pray — are you taking it far ? Let Me see you safe there ! ” said the wicked old varlet . Alas ! for Little Red Riding Hood , That she should be naughty instead of good ; That she should let the old wolf flatter , And allow him to walk By her side and talk , When her mother so strictly forbade her to chatter .</p>

     <p>“ What your name is , my dear , ” he said , “ fain I 'd be knowing . ” “ I 'm Little Red Riding Hood . ” “ Where are you going ? " “ I am going to my granny 's , to carry this jar And this cake from my mother . ” “ Indeed ! Is it far ? " “ Oh , you go through the wood , and a little beyond You ‘ ll see a small cottage that stands by a pond . ” “ And your granny lives there ? ” “ Yes ; but now she 's so old She can n't get out of bed and she suffers from cold . ” “ Poor dear , ” said the wolf , with a pitying grin ; “ But how does she do about letting you in ? " “ When I reach granny 's cottage I always take care To knock at the door till she calls out ‘ Who 's there ? ’ ] Your grandchild , who brings you a bite and a sup From her mother , ’ say I ; And she 's sure to reply , ‘ If you pull at the bobbin the latch will fly up . ’ That 's how I get in . ” “ Oh ! ” said wolf , in a hurry , “ This lane is my way , So I ‘ ll wish you good day . ” And he vanished at once in a terrible scurry ; Said Red Riding Hood , “ Does n't he seem in a flurry ! " Like a shot from a rifle ,— or faster a trifle , Away goes the wolf , and , I ‘ ll wager my life , ‘ ll Be up to some mischief or other ere long , For his only delight is in doing what 's wrong . Off through the wood — ( he 's up to no good ) , Hastening still — ( bent upon ill ) , Round by the pond , to the cottage beyond ( He 's after some evil I ‘ ll give you my bond ) , Stealing along — ( intending a wrong ) Towards the grandam 's abode , by the skirts of the road , ( By skirts I do n't mean either muslin or calico ,) He sneaks to what Shakespeare has called “ miching mallecho . ” Rap , tap ! at the door . In the midst of a snore The old lady woke up with a start , and said , “ Lor ! Red Riding Hood ne'er knocked so loudly before . Oh , deary me , it cannot be she ; I ‘ ll pretend I ‘ m still sleeping , and then we shall see . ” Rap , tap ! once more She heard at the door : The wolf rapped so hard that his knuckles were sore . “ The old woman sleeps like a top — what a bore ! If she does n't make haste , My time I shall waste — I shall miss that tit-bit who 's so much to my taste . ” Rap , tap ! Tap , rap ! “ She must wake from her nap , Or the child will be here Before I can clear Her foolish old grandmother up , every scrap . ” At last said the grandam , “ I rather a hand am At sleeping , I know , Very soundly , and so Perhaps she has waited and knocked there so long That , in order to wake me , her tap becomes strong . Who ‘ s there ? ” then she cried ; Said the wolf from outside , Disguising his voice the deception to hide , And whispering low with his mouth to a cranny , “ It 's no one but Little Red Riding Hood , granny ! I 've brought you some butter , some eggs , and a cake That mother got up in the morning to make , And she sends you besides some nice cream in a cup " “ If you pull at the bobbin the latch will fly up ! " Wolf pulled at the bobbin , And — what a sad job !— in He went ; but no sooner had thrust his grim knob in ( But for rhyming , instead Of “ knob ” I 'd say “ head ” ) Than the frightened old lady sat bolt up in bed : But before she had time to exclaim , “ Oh my gracious ! " She was bolted entire by the monster voracious ; Who , though the fierce pangs of his hunger were gratified , Remarked to himself , with a grumble dissatisfied , Tough skinny old folks are not nice things to victual one ; However , no matter ! Here goes for the little one ! "</p>

     <p>066 ] Then he turned down the bed-clothes and quickly jumped in , And granny 's big nightcap tied under his chin : And he cuddled the clothes Close up to his nose , And was speedily off in a very nice doze ; For said he , “ For Red Riding Hood if I 'd have any Respectable twist I must first digest granny . For though at one meal I could eat child , pa , and mamma , There 's a good deal of picking somehow about grandmamma ! " Little Red Riding Hood loitered along , Stopping to hear while the thrush sang his song , Or to list in the croft to the blackbird 's clear whistle , Or to follow the feathery down of the thistle — Or blowing in flocks The seeds from the “ clocks " Of the bright dandelions , or searching the docks For the burrs , whose chief trick Is to catch and to stick To one 's garments , no matter if thin ones or thick : ( Though it matters to you , Because they come through — Supposing your clothes are the former — and prick ) . Why , foolish butterfly , Will you skip , flutter , fly Close by the child ? You ‘ re an idiot utter , fly ! She puts down the honey and cake in a trice , And the latter 's immediately stolen by the mice . But what does the latter at all to her matter : She 's after that butterfly , mad as a hatter . [ It 's not clear to me Why a hatter should be Proverbially called a fit subject for De Luncitico — so runs the writ — inquirendo ; But I fancy the hatter this harsh innuendo Must , in the first place , to a humorous friend owe , Who fain in the sneer would his gratitude smother For a man who 's invariably felt for another . ] Through pastures and meads as the butterfly leads , Red Riding Hood follows , and little she heeds The orders and warning her mother that morning Had given her , or even her grandmother 's needs . But when she comes back once again to the track , And finds the cake gone , she grows frightened . “ Alack ! " She cries , “ what a loss ! Wo n't granny be cross , To breakfast off nothing — with honey for sauce ? ” Just then a glittering dragon-fly On gauzy pinion darted by . Oh , he was clad in burnished mail , His wing a fairy galley 's sail , And he was twice as big , I ween , As the biggest butterfly she had seen . Soon forgotten the honey 's ; She off with a run is Where the dragon-fly glancing so bright in the sun is . By ditches and hedges , by rushes and sedges , By ponds full of reeds and all sorts of weeds , By pools that are stagnant , and brooks full of waterbreaks ,</p>

     <p>She chases Libellula Eagerly . [ Well , you 'll a - Llow there must some Awful punishment come When her mother 's commands in this manner a daughter breaks . ] But conceive her concern When ,'on her return , She finds that an empty jar 's all she can earn . For the ants had discovered it placed in a sunny spot , And cleared all the honey , and left but the honey 's pot . Said she , “ Lack-a-day ! What will grandmother say ? And sha n't I get scolded for stopping to play ! I 'd better get on without further delay ! " Resolution how vain ! Again and again She loiters in meadow , wood , highway , and lane — Strays into the coppice To pick the bright poppies , Or climbs up the hedge for the nest that a-top is ; Or else she emerges Where widely diverges The forest 's long avenues — leafy green arches Of beeches , of ashes , of elms and of larches , Which she lingers beneath To pick for a wreath A bright trail of ivy , that some lofty stem on is , Or with bluebells her apron to fill — or anemones ; Or to watch the quaint habits And ways of the rabbits , And the plans of the crows , Who , as every one knows , Establish their scouts At certain look-outs , To warn them of danger whenever they ‘ ve doubts . [ As touching these rooks , Natural History books Declare that the thing to their greatest eclat 's The fact — which should win them the warmest applause — That nothing they do is e'er done without caws . ] But now she has passed Through the forest , and fast Is approaching her grandmother 's cottage at last . What excuse can she make For the honey and cake ? At the thought of that scrape she 's beginning to quake . She creeps through the garden , Attempting to harden Her heart , and declare she “ Do n't care a brass farden . ” But , in spite of her trying , She 's very near crying , And asking her granny to grant her a pardon . The knock is so faint , that the wolf 's scarce aware That there 's any one knocking , but cries out , “ Who 's there “ Red Riding Hood ” — here on her speech broke a sob in — “ Come to see you . ” Said wolf , “ If you pull at the bobbin , The latch will fly up ! ” So she opened the door , And tottered with terrified feet o'er the floor . Said wolf , “ Where 's the cake Mother promised to make ? ” “ Please , granny , to-day she 's not able to bake , For love or for money . ” “ Then where is my honey ? " “ What makes you expect any , granny ? How funny ! " Said Little Red Riding Hood , trying to smile , Although in a terrible fright all the while . “ To send me no breakfast , ” said wolf , “ she was silly ; I ‘ m feeling so hungry and faint , I 'm quite chilly . As you ‘ ve brought me no food , you must warm me instead ; I ‘ ll take you in place of my breakfast in bed . So take off your things , and , some help to your gran to be , Jump into bed , just for once warming-pan to be . ” She takes off her clothes , And into bed goes . Old wolf keeps the counterpane up to his nose , But the child sees with fear That , now she 's so near , Her grandmother 's looking remarkably queer . She trembles with fright , and in sad perturbation , Commences the following brief conversation :</p>

     <p>“ Oh , granny , I view your long ears with surprise ! " “ They ‘ re to hear all you say to the letter . ” “ Oh , granny , how fiery and big are your eyes ! " “ They ‘ re to see you all the better . ” “ Oh , granny , your teeth are tremendous in size ! " “ They ‘ re to eat you ! " — AND HE ATE HER . PUSS IN BOOTS . ‘ THERE once was a miller , who lived till he died — It 's been done by a good many people beside ; But this miller , you see , In particular — he , On the brink of the grave — “ on the banks of the dee , ” As a Scotchman would say ( vide song “ Annie Laurie ; " It North-country short is For articula mortis ) — Made a will , whence arises the whole of my story . Three sons had this miller , To whom all his “ siller , ” * Stock , business , premises , goodwill , and “ wilier ” — A tenure , in short , not to spin out my verse , on all Things he died “ seised ” of , both real and personal , ( Exclusive , of course , of the very bad cough With which he was seized — and which carried him off ) He had to devise — And , as you would surmise , Would divide in accordance with ages and size . But no !— not a bit ! He had n't the wit For such a division — or did n't see fit ; * Though with terms Caledonian this story is filled , You ‘ ll find it , 1 hope , only scotched , and not killed . But made a partition So strange in condition That to one ‘ t was a blow — for the others a hit . It is half after one , The funeral “ s done , The reading should now of the will be begun . The youngest is crying , The others are trying To think who 's most colour for praising the dying ; Their loss does n't grieve , Since it does not bereave Them of all that their father was able to leave . ( Though “ where there s a will , ” says the proverb , you know , There 's always a Way ” — there 's not always a Woe . ) When the will is recited They both are delighted , For it proves their young brother is cruelly slighted . For joy they with decency scarce can bemean them When they find that their dad Every thing that he had Has left them , the eldest , to own all between them , Save one thing — and that Is only the cat , Which he leaves to the youngest , described as “ that brat . ” The youngest , poor lad ! did n't care what he had , By the loss of a father , not fortune , made sad . But as silent he sat , nursing his cat , And quite at a loss what he next should be at , Each brother , addressing him sternly as Nemesis , ( Who , the Greeks say , less just and more cruel than Themis is ,) Said , “ Now then , young Lazybones ! Clear off the premises ! ' ’ He asked for some bread and some straw for a bed , And he 'd work like a slave for his brothers , he said . But they both answered , “ No ! you 'd much better go : We shall have to assist you along if you 're slow ! ” So , half broken-hearted , the poor lad departed , And thus in the world for himself he was started . ‘ T was a poorish look out , Of that there 's no doubt ; He 'd not an idea what he 'd best set about . So , much to be pitied , The old mill he quitted . The door gave a slam — Not one pang was spared for him — He sat by the dam , And that nobody cared for him He could not help feeling — and what was prepared for him ! Thus he sat , while big tear-drops his eyes were suffusing , Nor speaking a word , Till he suddenly heard , As he was a-musing , his cat , too , a mew sing . “ Ah , Puss , ” he said , “ you Are unfortunate too ; I 'm inclined to think yours the more serious disaster In having a penniless wretch for a master . ” Puss , thus addressed , his master caressed , And then in plain language his feelings expressed . “ Dear master , ” said he , “ just leave it to me ; You shall see , then , I promise , what then you shall see . I ‘ ll at once undertake Your fortune to make , And assist you to wreak your revenge on those brutes ; And all that I want is a new pair of boots ! ” The notion was funny : He had n't much money , But as nothing more hopeful appeared to be done , he Went off to a cobbler , who lived in a stall , And ordered the boots to be made — rather small . New boots , too ! Not shabby , old , worn-out , and holey ‘ uns , But a spick-and-span pair of resplendent Napoleons . The boots arrived , the bill was paid , And Pussy an excursion made . Some snares he prepares , To take dozens of hares , And a wire that will grab its Quantum of rabbits ; Without burning cartridges , Catches some partridges And several pheasants ; And bears them as presents To the court of the King — I can n't tell you his name , But history reports he was partial to game . Day after day the cat brought his prey In numbers sufficient to load a big dray , Or the cart which they call in the Crimea an arabah ; And each single thing He brought to the King “ With the loyal respects of the Marquis of Carabas . ” Said the monarch one day , “ Come , tell me , I pray , Whereabouts is the Marquis 's property , eh ? The cat , as requested , the quarter suggested Where the lands lay whose fee in the Marquis was vested . Said the monarch , “ Hooray ! I 'll drive over that way : Tell the Master of Horse just to bring round the chay . ” In a moment at that off went the cat At what modern slang styles “ a terrible bat , ” Faster and faster , till , reaching his master , He cried , “ Of your clothes be at once off a caster , And jump in the river that runs by the path ! " “ In the river — ” “ Do n't talk , sir , but pray go to bath ! " On the bank Pussy stayed , while his master obeyed ; But the Royal procession so long was delayed That he felt very cold in the stream , I 'm afraid . At last , “ Here they come ! ” cried Pussy : “ now , mum Is the word ! ” Said his master , “ With cold I am numb , But , while my teeth chatter so , cannot be dumb . ” Said the cat , “ My young friend , to this warning attend ; If you do , it will all turn out well in the end . You 've good fortune at hand , and the path 's very quick to it , So keep a look-out , Mind what you ‘ re about , And whatever I say , say you likewise — and stick to it ! "</p>

     <p>“ The Marquis of Carabas ’ clothes have been taken ! " Said the King , “ Deary me ! What is it I see ? My good friend the cat up a tropical tree ? " Ah , ” said Puss , “ my dear master has had a disaster , For some one has cut — ” “ Cut ! Oh , here 's some court plaster . ” “ No , sire , ” said the cat , “ He does n't want that . He needs no court plaster , but needs a court suit ; For while he was bathing some mannerless brute , Who had chosen the reeds and the rushes to lurk in , Cut away with his hosen , knee-breeches , and jerkin . ” “ Is that all ? ” said the King ; “ My servants shall bring Whatever is needful — cloak , stockings , cap , sword , robe , Gloves , collar , and doublet — in short , a whole wardrobe , Each thing that he wants , From castor to pants . ” [ Of course , you ‘ re aware when a king takes the air He 's provided with changes of clothing to spare — At least , so this legend would seem to declare . ] The servants produce for the Marquis 's use A rich velvet suit with gold trimmings profuse , A rich velvet mantle with a lining of satin , A diamond brooch stuck a point-lace cravat in , While another the ostrich plume fastened the hat in . These elegant clothes Were couleur de rose , With trimmings of green and with apple-green hose , With noeuds of ruban , to encase his stout mollets ( For further particulars , please see Le Follet ) . Our hero , attired in the garb thus acquired , By the King 's lovely daughter was greatly admired , Who sat ( as before I intended to state ) on The right of her pa in the royal “ phe-ayton . ” But I 'm bound to confess Our hero no less Was charmed by her grace and her beauty in turn — For if she liked his looks , he was ravished with “ hern Said the King , “ My dear Marquis , it 's really a treat Thus to fall in with one I ‘ ve been dying to meet . Pray take a seat , And let me repeat How much I 'm obliged for your numerous presents Of partridges , rabbits , grouse , woodcocks , and pheasants . We ‘ re going for a drive — pray enter the carriage . Here 's my daughter — she 's yours , if you wish it , in marriage . Any news ? None , I fear : Bread 's still getting dear , But the weather is fine for the time of the year . I suppose we are passing here through your estate ? " So the King rattled on , But the old miller 's son , Unable to answer , sat scratching his pate , But Pussy cut in with , “ Yes ! though he 's in doubt of it ; And for why ? Dash my wig ! Because it 's so big He never can tell if he 's in it or out of it . But your Majesty , p'rhaps , Will order your chaps To drive to the castle , which certainly caps Any castles you 'll meet in a long summer day ; And , if you ‘ ll allow me , I 'll show them the way . ” To Pussy 's request the King promptly accedes , Bids his coachman to follow wherever he leads , And away the cat sped A long way ahead On a road that was bordered by corn-land and meads . Pussy well knew That the land they passed through Belonged to a wizard — a mighty one , too —— Who , besides with the Evil One being “ colloguer , ” ( Do n't think I , in quoting from “ Arrah na Pogue , ” err : It 's what Shaun the Post says to Feeney ,— the rogue — urgh ! ) * Was that Middle Aged cannibal known as an ogre . But where'er in the fields , as on they kept going , They came upon labourers reaping or mowing , Or ploughing or harrowing , weeding or sowing — The cat ran before , And cried out , “ Give o'er ! , Your master commands ! ” and the workmen forebore . Said Puss , “ He ‘ ll approach In a splendid state-coach , And has sent me before him these tidings to broach , And to bid you , unless you wish demons to tease you , If the King , his companion , inquires who employs you , With one voice in a moment , men , women , and boys , you Must haste to declare , With a satisfied air ,'The Marquis of Carabas , sire , an it please you ! ' See ! The carriage draws near ! Come , haste ! Do you hear ? Quit all occupations , And haste to your stations , And give him the lowest of low salutations ! "</p>

     <p>085 ] The poor people , afraid , His orders obeyed .— The Marquis himself became rather dismayed ,</p>
    </figure>
    <epigraph>
     <p>* This expletive , used to express utter loathing , I scarcely can spell — One really can n't tell How to put sounds in etymological clothing . Thinking what was to end all these funny proceedings Into which he was following Pussy 's queer leadings ; But he felt he was sinned against rather than sinning For Pussy strange fun With the clothes had begun , But what would the close be of such a beginning ? Still on Pussy speeds By pastures and meads , And the coachman still follows wherever he leads . “ Your estates are enormous — Pray , Marquis , inform us , If I may inquire , Did they come from your sire ? He must really have been a most terrible lord , Acquiring so much by the right of the sword . I 'm pleased to perceive , With such riches to leave , He 'd a son of such merit The wealth to inherit Of so mighty a conqueror and enemy-killer . ” “ Yes , ” said the youth , “ To tell you the truth , My late father had quite a renown as a miller . ” The Princess smiled sweetly , As if to hint neatly ,'Though she counted the father A conqueror rather , She fancied the son Had a victory won — In fact , she was sure — as the smile would infer — About one of his conquests , and that was of her ! For she felt he was lord of her bosom completely . And now the fields and meads they leave ; To right and left huge mountains rise , And seem — so much their heights deceive — With lofty crests to touch the skies . Pine forests clothe their sombre sides , Where dark ravines and gorges frown , And many a mountain torrent glides , Or bounds from ledge to ledge adown . Their mighty wings the eagles flap High up among the summits lone , Whose peaks the snows eternal cap , Or where the glacier billows groan . But in the plain about the base Of this portentous mountain chain , The signs of human toil they trace , And find men labouring again . Here , turned by some wild torrent 's force , Huge wheels revolve with busy hum ; There some vast chasm stops their course , Whose depths the eye would vainly plumb ; Or , laden deep on shrieking wheels , Toil waggons up the steep inclines : Their load the mystery reveals ,— This region is a place of mines ! As soon as Puss got to this desolate spot , Addressing the miners , he kept up the plot . “ See your master approach In the King 's grand state-coach ; He has sent me before him , his orders to broach . “'Then haste ts your stations And make him the lowest of low salutations ’ " If you do n't wish the gnomes and the kobolds to seize you , When asked whom you obey , Be certain to say , ‘ The Marquis of Carabas , sire , an it please you ! ’ When His Majesty 's Grace Appears on the place , You must bow till each one touches earth with his face ! ” To every word That from Pussy they heard The miners attended — Low bowed and low bended ; And when the King came , And asked them the name Of their master , they answered him all just the same . And I 'd just hint to you That as thus this whole crew Of miners obeyed — minors always should do . But now having passed through this wild tract at last , They came to a plain greenly wooded and vast , And spied out , half hid A thick forest amid , A castle that stood on the crest of a hill , Or the brow of a rock — you may choose which you will ; For the hill was so steep The road had to creep Round and round from the baser To the gates of the place , Though Pussy went straight up the side at full chase , While slowly around The royal coach wound , The horses got pretty well tired , I ‘ ll be bound , For such roads will e'en puzzle a nag that is sound . Half-way to the top Puss in Boots made a stop Not because he was tired and quite ready to drop , But because he encountered a dame and her goodman And child — by profession the man was a woodman — And wished to inquire Ere he went any higher If this past all doubt was the castle and dwelling Of the wizard of whom I have elsewhere been telling . So , making a bow , he said , “ Pray allow Me to ask you one question that struck me just now — That castle that rises To dazzle our eyes is The abode , I suppose , of a man of position :</p>
    </epigraph>
    <figure>
     <p>091 ] “ The palace , ” said they , “ of a mighty magician , So harsh and severe he 's regarded with fear By all the poor people who dwell about here ; The best course , if you asked us , that we 'd recommend to you , Is not to go near him — he may put an end to you . ” Said Puss , “ Never fear , for I 'll persevere Till the neighbourhood I of this wicked one clear . ”</p>
    </figure>
    <docImprint>So he went on once more , till reaching the door Of the castle , he gave with the knocker a score Of such rat-tat-tat-tats , to the blush as would put man - - Y thundering knocks by a real<settlement>London</settlement>footman . The door was flung wide , and Puss stept inside , But not an attendant there was to be spied — Nought but a hand Bearing a wand , That pointed the way with a courtesy bland , By corridors gorgeous , up staircases grand , Through halls by arched ceilings , all painted , o'erspanned , Along galleries brilliant with lovely stained windows , Whose curtains were made Of that Indian brocade Which Great Britain , ‘ t is said , to the conquest of Scinde owes ; Though the wizard of course got his curtains by witchcraft , Not by merchant-ships , P. and O. steamers , or sich craft . At length doth Puss enter A hall in whose centre The Ogre he spies , cui Cyclopius venter . ( Which , translated , would mean “ as a matter of taste , His figure and form ran a good deal to waist . ” ) He has taken his seat , Preparing to eat An enormous repast of all manner of meat — Beef , mutton , and veal , each in separate bowl — And the different beasts are served up to him whole ; And there 's one dish , moreover , That Puss can discover , That strikes him with horror and harrows his soul — Babes of quite slender years ( that means tender , not thin , age ) Piled up on a dish ( and no gammon ) , and spinach . * Puss , nothing daunted ( Although ‘ t will be granted The sight in some hearts might have terror implanted ) , Walked straight to the board Where the monster abhorred At the servants attending him bellowed and roared ; And servants sure ne'er on their master attended With such an unwilling respect as those men did ! “ Rascals of mine ! Bring me some wine , Or I ‘ ll cut you in sunder from head-piece to chine ! "</docImprint>
    <epigraph>
     <p>* In thus making spinach ‘ To rhyme as with Greenwich I ‘ m authorised wholly By Anthony Rowley , Whose edito princeps ( of course it 's a foli - - O ) spells the word s. p. i. n. n. a. g. e — And if any should know how to spell it , ‘ t would be he . Alarmed at the speaker , One brought a big beaker Of wine — one-tenth part had floored any one weaker . But the Ogre held up the great glass to his eye In a critical way , Smacked his lips , just to say “ That ‘ ll do ! ” and then all at one gulp drained it dry , And set down the goblet . [ I cannot see why It is called so , and count as a regular puzzle it ; For since it 's to drink , Not to eat from , you 'd think They 'd , instead of a “ gobble-it , ” call it a “ guzzle-it . ” ]</p>
    </epigraph>
    <figure>
     <p>093 ] Drawing near the huge chair with a reverent air , With knee lowly bent , hand on heart , and head bare , “ Quite delighted , I 'm sure , ” so Puss courteously spake , “ The acquaintance of one so distinguished to make , For skill that 's gigantic in arts necromantic , Whose fame — not to speak it in terms sycophantic — Is driving with envy all wizards quite frantic , European , or Asian , or e'en Transatlantic ! ” Here Puss bowed again with a courtier-like antic . Even wizards , I fear , or so ‘ t would appear , Cannot always , unmoved , artful flattery hear . The Ogre said , “ Ugh ! Pray who are you ? In return for these compliments what can I do ? For since I 'm not vain , it seems pretty plain You would not tell me this without some hope of gain . ” Says Pussy , “ Quite right — you ‘ re very polite — Of your magical powers I 'd fain have a sight . There 's one now report says is yours , the which borders On what is impossible . ” “ Pray give your orders , And I ‘ ll open your eyes with a little surprise , And prove that report does not always tell lies . ” “ Well , since you 're so kind — what a wonderful dodge I call Is the power of assuming all shapes zoological — Ape , bear , lion , elephant , wolf , hippopotamus ( The latter a beast Scarcely known in the least Till the Pacha of Egypt obliging got ‘ em us ) , Tiger , peccary , leopard , gnu , paradoxurus ; Or e'en if you wish A bird or a fish — The penguin , for instance , or Buckland 's silurus . ” Said the Ogre , “ He ! he ! You quickly shall see — That 's only child'shYpppHeNplay to a wizard like me ! " So without more ado , hands and knees on he sunk , His ears turned to flaps , and his nose to a trunk , And his form all at once took so quickly to swelling , He threatened to knock off the roof of his dwelling . “ Bravo ! ” cried the cat ; “ that 's capital , that ! You ‘ re almost as big as the Heidelberg vat ! But can you now , please , with just as much ease Into smaller dimensions at once yourself squeeze ? Say , turn from the elephant , big as the house , Sans any embarrassment , into a mouse ? " Bulk , big legs , and trunk Immediately shrunk ! In three seconds — no more — Was a mouse on the floor Where the elephant stood but an instant before . At one bound , quick as thought , That mouse Pussy caught , And before any aid from his charms could be sought , Or help could be had from the spirits who followed him , Had given the magician one grip — and then swallowed him ! Then back to the door Puss hastened once more ,</p>
    </figure>
    <epigraph>
     <p>Just in time to receive the state carriage and four . He helped to descend His master and friend , Who was still in bewilderment how it would end , And proceeded to bring The Princess and the King Through all the grand rooms , Where pages and grooms — Who were glad with the Marquis their old situations To hold in the castle — made low salutations . To cut my tale short , They returned to the court , And , since nobody wished their attachment to thwart , The young folks were married , And he his bride carried To his castle , where happily ever they tarried ; And the cat was provided — The King so decided — ’ With a cushion of silk And a gallon of milk Every day of his life till the day that he died-ed . I ‘ ve only to add The fortunate lad Sent and fetched his two brothers so cruel and bad , And recalling the past To their memory , at ’ last Told his present good fortune , which made them aghast ; And then , bidding them better in future behave them , To be nobly revenged on them both — he forgave them !</p>
