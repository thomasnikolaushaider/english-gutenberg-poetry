    <docImprint>University Press : John Wilson and Son ,<settlement>Cambridge</settlement>, U. S. A. TO MY MOTHER , IN ALL REVERENCE AND LOVE , I INSCRIBE THIS BOOK . THE AUTHOR TO HER AMERICAN READERS . My little book seems scarcely to admit of prefatory words : either it will speak for itself , or all my additions must fail to speak for it . Its reappearance , however , in an American edition , gives me a welcome opportunity of acknowledging the courtesy and liberality of Messrs. Roberts Brothers , who have arranged with me and with my kind friend and publisher , Mr. Macmillan , to bring it before the American public . CHRISTINA G. ROSSETTI .<settlement>London</settlement>.</docImprint>

     <l n="32">Evening by evening</l>
     <l n="33">Among the brookside rushes ,</l>
     <l n="34">Laura bowed her head to hear ,</l>
     <l n="35">Lizzie veiled her blushes :</l>
     <l n="36">Crouching close together</l>
     <l n="37">In the cooling weather ,</l>
     <l n="38">With clasping arms and cautioning lips ,</l>
     <l n="39">With tingling cheeks and finger-tips .</l>
     <l n="40">“ Lie close , ” Laura said ,</l>
     <l n="41">Pricking up her golden head :</l>
     <l n="42">“ We must not look at goblin men ,</l>
     <l n="43">We must not buy their fruits :</l>
     <l n="44">Who knows upon what soil they fed</l>
     <l n="45">Their hungry thirsty roots ? ”</l>
     <l n="46">“ Come buy , ” call the goblins</l>
     <l n="47">Hobbling down the glen .</l>
     <l n="48">“ O , ” cried Lizzie , “ Laura , Laura ,</l>
     <l n="49">You should not peep at goblin men . ”</l>
     <l n="50">Lizzie covered up her eyes ,</l>
     <l n="51">Covered close lest they should look ;</l>
     <l n="52">Laura reared her glossy head ,</l>
     <l n="53">And whispered like the restless brook :</l>
     <l n="54">“ Look , Lizzie , look , Lizzie ,</l>
     <l n="55">Down the glen tramp little men .</l>
     <l n="56">One hauls a basket ,</l>
     <l n="57">One bears a plate ,</l>
     <l n="58">One lugs a golden dish</l>
     <l n="59">Of many pounds ’ weight .</l>
     <l n="60">How fair the vine must grow</l>
     <l n="61">Whose grapes are so luscious ;</l>
     <l n="62">How warm the wind must blow</l>
     <l n="63">Through those fruit bushes . ”</l>
     <l n="64">“ No , ” said Lizzie , “ no , no , no ;</l>
     <l n="65">Their offers should not charm us ,</l>
     <l n="66">Their evil gifts would harm us . ”</l>
     <l n="67">She thrust a dimpled finger</l>
     <l n="68">In each ear , shut eyes and ran :</l>
     <l n="69">Curious Laura chose to linger</l>
     <l n="70">Wondering at each merchant man .</l>
     <l n="71">One had a cat 's face ,</l>
     <l n="72">One whisked a tail ,</l>
     <l n="73">One tramped at a rat 's pace ,</l>
     <l n="74">One crawled like a snail ,</l>
     <l n="75">One like a wombat prowled obtuse and furry ,</l>
     <l n="76">One like a ratel tumbled hurry-scurry .</l>
     <l n="77">She heard a voice like voice of doves</l>
     <l n="78">Cooing all together :</l>
     <l n="79">They sounded kind and full of loves</l>
     <l n="80">In the pleasant weather .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="81">Laura stretched her gleaming neck</l>
     <l n="82">Like a rush-imbedded swan ,</l>
     <l n="83">Like a lily from the beck ,</l>
     <l n="84">Like a moonlit poplar branch ,</l>
     <l n="85">Like a vessel at the launch</l>
     <l n="86">When its last restraint is gone .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="87">Backwards up the mossy glen</l>
     <l n="88">Turned and trooped the goblin men ,</l>
     <l n="89">With their shrill repeated cry ,</l>
     <l n="90">“ Come buy , come buy . ”</l>
     <l n="91">When they reached where Laura was</l>
     <l n="92">They stood stock still upon the moss ,</l>
     <l n="93">Leering at each other ,</l>
     <l n="94">Brother with queer brother ;</l>
     <l n="95">Signalling each other ,</l>
     <l n="96">Brother with sly brother .</l>
     <l n="97">One set his basket down ,</l>
     <l n="98">One reared his plate ;</l>
     <l n="99">One began to weave a crown</l>
     <l n="100">Of tendrils , leaves , and rough nuts brown</l>
     <l n="101">( Men sell not such in any town ) ;</l>
     <l n="102">One heaved the golden weight</l>
     <l n="103">Of dish and fruit to offer her :</l>
     <l n="104">“ Come buy , come buy , ” was still their cry .</l>
     <l n="105">Laura stared but did not stir ,</l>
     <l n="106">Longed but had no money :</l>
     <l n="107">The whisk-tailed merchant bade her taste</l>
     <l n="108">In tones as smooth as honey ,</l>
     <l n="109">The cat-faced purr 'd ,</l>
     <l n="110">The rat-paced spoke a word</l>
     <l n="111">Of welcome , and the snail-paced even was heard ;</l>
     <l n="112">One parrot-voiced and jolly</l>
     <l n="113">Cried “ Pretty Goblin ” still for “ Pretty Polly ” ;—</l>
     <l n="114">One whistled like a bird .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="115">But sweet-tooth Laura spoke in haste :</l>
     <l n="116">“ Good folk , I have no coin ;</l>
     <l n="117">To take were to purloin :</l>
     <l n="118">I have no copper in my purse ,</l>
     <l n="119">I have no silver either ,</l>
     <l n="120">And all my gold is on the furze</l>
     <l n="121">That shakes in windy weather</l>
     <l n="122">Above the rusty heather . ”</l>
     <l n="123">“ You have much gold upon your head , ”</l>
     <l n="124">They answered altogether :</l>
     <l n="125">“ Buy from us with a golden curl . ”</l>
     <l n="126">She clipped a precious golden lock ,</l>
     <l n="127">She dropped a tear more rare than pearl ,</l>
     <l n="128">Then sucked their fruit globes fair or red :</l>
     <l n="129">Sweeter than honey from the rock ,</l>
     <l n="130">Stronger than man-rejoicing wine ,</l>
     <l n="131">Clearer than water flowed that juice ;</l>
     <l n="132">She never tasted such before ,</l>
     <l n="133">How should it cloy with length of use ?</l>
     <l n="134">She sucked and sucked and sucked the more</l>
     <l n="135">Fruits which that unknown orchard bore ;</l>

     <l n="3">I stood beside Euphrates while it swelled</l>
     <l n="4">Like overflowing Jordan in its youth :</l>
     <l n="5">It waxed and colored sensibly to sight ,</l>
     <l n="6">Till out of myriad pregnant waves there welled</l>
     <l n="7">Young crocodiles , a gaunt blunt-featured crew ,</l>
     <l n="8">Fresh-hatched perhaps and daubed with birthday dew .</l>
     <l n="9">The rest if I should tell , I fear my friend ,</l>
     <l n="10">My closest friend , would deem the facts untrue ;</l>
     <l n="11">And therefore it were wisely left untold ;</l>

     <l n="13">Each crocodile was girt with massive gold</l>
     <l n="14">And polished stones , that with their wearers grew :</l>
     <l n="15">But one there was who waxed beyond the rest ,</l>
     <l n="16">Wore kinglier girdle and a kingly crown ,</l>
     <l n="17">Whilst crowns and orbs and sceptres starred his breast .</l>
     <l n="18">All gleamed compact and green with scale on scale ,</l>
     <l n="19">But special burnishment adorned his mail ,</l>
     <l n="20">And special terror weighed upon his frown ;</l>
     <l n="21">His punier brethren quaked before his tail ,</l>
     <l n="22">Broad as a rafter , potent as a flail .</l>
     <l n="23">So he grew lord and master of his kin :</l>
     <l n="24">But who shall tell the tale of all their woes ?</l>
     <l n="25">An execrable appetite arose ,</l>
     <l n="26">He battened on them , crunched , and sucked them in .</l>
     <l n="27">He knew no law , he feared no binding law ,</l>
     <l n="28">But ground them with inexorable jaw :</l>
     <l n="29">The luscious fat distilled upon his chin ,</l>
     <l n="30">Exuded from his nostrils and his eyes ,</l>
     <l n="31">While still like hungry death he fed his maw ;</l>

     <l n="38">Then from far off a wingèd vessel came ,</l>
     <l n="39">Swift as a swallow , subtle as a flame :</l>
     <l n="40">I know not what it bore of freight or host ,</l>

     <l n="45">Till not a murmur swelled or billow beat :</l>
     <l n="46">Lo , as the purple shadow swept the sands ,</l>
     <l n="47">The prudent crocodile rose on his feet</l>

     <l n="82">Thy Name will I remember , praising it ,</l>
     <l n="83">Though Thou forget me , though Thou hide Thy face ,</l>
     <l n="84">And blot me from the Book which Thou hast writ ;</l>
     <l n="85">Thy Name will I remember in my praise</l>
     <l n="86">And call to mind Thy faithfulness of old ,</l>

     <l n="28">Be Husband , Brother , closest Friend to me ;</l>
     <l n="29">Love me as very mother loves her son ,</l>
     <l n="30">Her sucking firstborn fondled on her knee :</l>
     <l n="31">Yea , more than mother loves her little one ;</l>
     <l n="32">For , earthly , even a mother may forget</l>
     <l n="33">And feel no pity for its piteous moan ;</l>
     <l n="34">But Thou , O Love of God , remember yet ,</l>
     <l n="35">Through the dry desert , through the waterflood</l>
     <l n="36">( Life , death ) , until the Great White Throne is set .</l>
     <l n="37">If now I am sick in chewing the bitter cud</l>
     <l n="38">Of sweet past sin , though solaced by Thy grace ,</l>
     <l n="39">And ofttimes strengthened by Thy Flesh and Blood ,</l>
     <l n="40">How shall I then stand up before Thy face ,</l>
     <l n="41">When from Thine eyes repentance shall be hid ,</l>
     <l n="42">And utmost Justice stand in Mercy 's place :</l>
     <l n="43">When every sin I thought or spoke or did</l>
     <l n="44">Shall meet me at the inexorable bar ,</l>
     <l n="45">And there be no man standing in the mid</l>
     <l n="46">To plead for me ; while star fallen after star</l>
     <l n="47">With heaven and earth are like a ripened shock ,</l>
     <l n="48">And all time 's mighty works and wonders are</l>
     <l n="49">Consumed as in a moment ; when no rock</l>
     <l n="50">Remains to fall on me , no tree to hide ,</l>
     <l n="51">But I stand all creation 's gazing-stock ,</l>
     <l n="52">Exposed and comfortless on every side ,</l>
     <l n="53">Placed trembling in the final balances</l>
     <l n="54">Whose poise this hour , this moment , must be tried ?—</l>
     <l n="55">Ah , Love of God , if greater love than this</l>
     <l n="56">Hath no man , that a man die for his friend ,</l>
     <l n="57">And if such love of love Thine Own Love is ,</l>
     <l n="58">Plead with Thyself , with me , before the end ;</l>
     <l n="59">Redeem me from the irrevocable past ;</l>
     <l n="60">Pitch Thou Thy Presence round me to defend ;</l>
     <l n="61">Yea seek with piercèd feet , yea hold me fast</l>
     <l n="62">With piercèd hands whose wounds were made by love ;</l>
     <l n="63">Not what I am , remember what Thou wast</l>
     <l n="64">When darkness hid from Thee Thy heavens above ,</l>
     <l n="65">And sin Thy Father 's Face , while Thou didst drink</l>
     <l n="66">The bitter cup of death , didst taste thereof</l>
     <l n="67">For every man ; while Thou wast nigh to sink</l>
     <l n="68">Beneath the intense intolerable rod ,</l>
     <l n="69">Grown sick of love ; not what I am , but think</l>
     <l n="70">Thy Life then ransomed mine , my God , my God .</l>

   <note>Two Robin Redbreasts are seen tapping with their beaks at the lattice , which January opens . The birds flutter in , hop about the floor , and peck up the crumbs and sugar thrown to them .

January hangs a guard in front of the fire , and opens to February , who appears with a bunch of snowdrops in her hand .</note>

   <note>She hands a few of her snowdrops to January , who retires into the background .

   <p>MONNA INNOMINATA .</p>
   <p>A SONNET OF SONNETS .</p>
   <p>Beatrice , immortalized by “ altissimo poeta ... cotanto amante ; ” Laura , celebrated by a great though an inferior bard ,— have alike paid the exceptional penalty of exceptional honor , and have come down to us resplendent with charms , but ( at least , to my apprehension ) scant of attractiveness .</p>
   <p>These heroines of world-wide fame were preceded by a bevy of unnamed ladies “ donne innominate ” sung by a school of less conspicuous poets ; and in that land and that period which gave simultaneous birth to Catholics , to Albigenses , and to Troubadours , one can imagine many a lady as sharing her lover 's poetic aptitude , while the barrier between them might be one held sacred by both , yet not such as to render mutual love incompatible with mutual honor .</p>
   <p>Had such a lady spoken for herself , the portrait left us might have appeared more tender , if less dignified , than any drawn even by a devoted friend . Or had the Great Poetess of our own day and nation only been unhappy instead of happy , her circumstances would have invited her to bequeath to us , in lieu of the “ Portuguese Sonnets , ” an inimitable “ donna innominata ” drawn not from fancy but from feeling , and worthy to occupy a niche beside Beatrice and Laura .</p>

    <head>A WINTRY SONNET .</head>
     <l n="1">A robin said : The Spring will never come ,</l>
     <l n="2">And I shall never care to build again .</l>
     <l n="3">A Rosebush said : These frosts are wearisome ,</l>
     <l n="4">My sap will never stir for sun or rain .</l>
     <l n="5">The half Moon said : These nights are fogged and slow ,</l>
     <l n="6">I neither care to wax nor care to wane .</l>
     <l n="7">The Ocean said : I thirst from long ago ,</l>
     <l n="8">Because earth 's rivers cannot fill the main .</l>
     <l n="9">When springtime came , red Robin built a nest ,</l>
     <l n="10">And trilled a lover 's song in sheer delight .</l>
     <l n="11">Gray hoarfrost vanished , and the Rose with might</l>
     <l n="12">Clothed her in leaves and buds of crimson core .</l>
     <l n="13">The dim Moon brightened . Ocean sunned his crest ,</l>
     <l n="14">Dimpled his blue ,— yet thirsted evermore .</l>

     <l n="2">The climber sets his foot and sets his face ,</l>
     <l n="3">Tracks lingering sunbeams to their halting-place ,</l>
     <l n="4">And counts the last pulsations of the light .</l>
     <l n="5">Strenuous thro ’ day and unsurprised by night</l>
     <l n="6">He runs a race with Time , and wins the race ,</l>
     <l n="7">Emptied and stripped of all save only Grace ,</l>
     <l n="8">Will , Love ,— a threefold panoply of might .</l>
     <l n="9">Darkness descends for light he toiled to seek ;</l>
     <l n="10">He stumbles on the darkened mountain-head ,</l>
     <l n="11">Left breathless in the unbreathable thin air ,</l>
     <l n="12">Made freeman of the living and the dead ,—</l>
     <l n="13">He wots not he has topped the topmost peak ,</l>
     <l n="14">But the returning sun will find him there .</l>
