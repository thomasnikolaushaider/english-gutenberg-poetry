    <head>BALLADE DEDICATORY — TO MRS. ELTON OF WHITE STAUNTON</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">The painted Briton built his mound ,</l>
     <l n="2">And left his celts and clay ,</l>
     <l n="3">On yon fair slope of sunlit ground</l>
     <l n="4">That fronts your garden gay ;</l>
     <l n="5">The Roman came , he bore the sway ,</l>
     <l n="6">He bullied , bought , and sold ,</l>
     <l n="7">Your fountain sweeps his works away</l>
     <l n="8">Beside your manor old !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">But still his crumbling urns are found</l>
     <l n="10">Within the window-bay ,</l>
     <l n="11">Where once he listened to the sound</l>
     <l n="12">That lulls you day by day ; -</l>
     <l n="13">The sound of summer winds at play ,</l>
     <l n="14">The noise of waters cold</l>
     <l n="15">To Yarty wandering on their way ,</l>
     <l n="16">Beside your manor old !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="17">The Roman fell : his firm-set bound</l>
     <l n="18">Became the Saxon 's stay ;</l>
     <l n="19">The bells made music all around</l>
     <l n="20">For monks in cloisters grey ,</l>
     <l n="21">Till fled the monks in disarray</l>
     <l n="22">From their warm chantry 's fold ,</l>
     <l n="23">Old Abbots slumber as they may ,</l>
     <l n="24">Beside your manor old !</l>

     <l n="2">Down into darkness , rolled ;</l>

    <head>A DREAM IN JUNE</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">In twilight of the longest day</l>
     <l n="2">I lingered over Lucian ,</l>
     <l n="3">Till ere the dawn a dreamy way</l>
     <l n="4">My spirit found , untrod of man ,</l>
     <l n="5">Between the green sky and the grey .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="6">Amid the soft dusk suddenly</l>
     <l n="7">More light than air I seemed to sail ,</l>
     <l n="8">Afloat upon the ocean sky ,</l>
     <l n="9">While through the faint blue , clear and pale ,</l>
     <l n="10">I saw the mountain clouds go by :</l>
     <l n="11">My barque had thought for helm and sail ,</l>
     <l n="12">And one mist wreath for canopy .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="13">Like torches on a marble floor</l>
     <l n="14">Reflected , so the wild stars shone ,</l>
     <l n="15">Within the abysmal hyaline ,</l>
     <l n="16">Till the day widened more and more ,</l>
     <l n="17">And sank to sunset , and was gone ,</l>
     <l n="18">And then , as burning beacons shine</l>
     <l n="19">On summits of a mountain isle ,</l>
     <l n="20">A light to folk on sea that fare ,</l>
     <l n="21">So the sky 's beacons for a while</l>
     <l n="22">Burned in these islands of the air .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="23">Then from a starry island set</l>
     <l n="24">Where one swift tide of wind there flows ,</l>
     <l n="25">Came scent of lily and violet ,</l>
     <l n="26">Narcissus , hyacinth , and rose ,</l>
     <l n="27">Laurel , and myrtle buds , and vine ,</l>
     <l n="28">So delicate is the air and fine :</l>
     <l n="29">And forests of all fragrant trees</l>
     <l n="30">Sloped seaward from the central hill ,</l>
     <l n="31">And ever clamorous were these</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="32">With singing of glad birds ; and still</l>
     <l n="33">Such music came as in the woods</l>
     <l n="34">Most lonely , consecrate to Pan ,</l>
     <l n="35">The Wind makes , in his many moods ,</l>
     <l n="36">Upon the pipes some shepherd Man ,</l>
     <l n="37">Hangs up , in thanks for victory !</l>
     <l n="38">On these shall mortals play no more ,</l>
     <l n="39">But the Wind doth touch them , over and o'er ,</l>
     <l n="40">And the Wind 's breath in the reeds will sigh .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="41">Between the daylight and the dark</l>
     <l n="42">That island lies in silver air ,</l>
     <l n="43">And suddenly my magic barque</l>
     <l n="44">Wheeled , and ran in , and grounded there ;</l>
     <l n="45">And by me stood the sentinel</l>
     <l n="46">Of them who in the island dwell ;</l>
     <l n="47">All smiling did he bind my hands ,</l>
     <l n="48">With rushes green and rosy bands ,</l>
     <l n="49">They have no harsher bonds than these</l>
     <l n="50">The people of the pleasant lands</l>
     <l n="51">Within the wash of the airy seas !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="52">Then was I to their city led :</l>
     <l n="53">Now all of ivory and gold</l>
     <l n="54">The great walls were that garlanded</l>
     <l n="55">The temples in their shining fold ,</l>
     <l n="56">( Each fane of beryl built , and each</l>
     <l n="57">Girt with its grove of shadowy beech ,)</l>
     <l n="58">And all about the town , and through ,</l>
     <l n="59">There flowed a River fed with dew ,</l>
     <l n="60">As sweet as roses , and as clear</l>
     <l n="61">As mountain crystals pure and cold ,</l>
     <l n="62">And with his waves that water kissed</l>
     <l n="63">The gleaming altars of amethyst</l>
     <l n="64">That smoke with victims all the year ,</l>
     <l n="65">And sacred are to the Gods of old .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="66">There sat three Judges by the Gate ,</l>
     <l n="67">And I was led before the Three ,</l>
     <l n="68">And they but looked on me , and straight</l>
     <l n="69">The rosy bonds fell down from me</l>
     <l n="70">Who , being innocent , was free ;</l>
     <l n="71">And I might wander at my will</l>
     <l n="72">About that City on the hill ,</l>
     <l n="73">Among the happy people clad</l>
     <l n="74">In purple weeds of woven air</l>
     <l n="75">Hued like the webs that Twilight weaves</l>
     <l n="76">At shut of languid summer eves</l>
     <l n="77">So light their raiment seemed ; and glad</l>
     <l n="78">Was every face I looked on there !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="79">There was no heavy heat , no cold ,</l>
     <l n="80">The dwellers there wax never old ,</l>
     <l n="81">Nor wither with the waning time ,</l>
     <l n="82">But each man keeps that age he had</l>
     <l n="83">When first he won the fairy clime .</l>
     <l n="84">The Night falls never from on high ,</l>
     <l n="85">Nor ever burns the heat of noon .</l>
     <l n="86">But such soft light eternally</l>
     <l n="87">Shines , as in silver dawns of June</l>
     <l n="88">Before the Sun hath climbed the sky !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="89">Within these pleasant streets and wide ,</l>
     <l n="90">The souls of Heroes go and come ,</l>
     <l n="91">Even they that fell on either side</l>
     <l n="92">Beneath the walls of Ilium ;</l>
     <l n="93">And sunlike in that shadowy isle</l>
     <l n="94">The face of Helen and her smile</l>
     <l n="95">Makes glad the souls of them that knew</l>
     <l n="96">Grief for her sake a little while !</l>
     <l n="97">And all true Greeks and wise are there ;</l>
     <l n="98">And with his hand upon the hair</l>
     <l n="99">Of Phaedo , saw I Socrates ,</l>
     <l n="100">About him many youths and fair ,</l>
     <l n="101">Hylas , Narcissus , and with these</l>
     <l n="102">Him whom the quoit of Phoebus slew</l>
     <l n="103">By fleet Eurotas , unaware !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="104">All these their mirth and pleasure made</l>
     <l n="105">Within the plain Elysian ,</l>
     <l n="106">The fairest meadow that may be ,</l>
     <l n="107">With all green fragrant trees for shade</l>
     <l n="108">And every scented wind to fan ,</l>
     <l n="109">And sweetest flowers to strew the lea ;</l>
     <l n="110">The soft Winds are their servants fleet</l>
     <l n="111">To fetch them every fruit at will</l>
     <l n="112">And water from the river chill ;</l>
     <l n="113">And every bird that singeth sweet</l>
     <l n="114">Throstle , and merle , and nightingale</l>
     <l n="115">Brings blossoms from the dewy vale , -</l>
     <l n="116">Lily , and rose , and asphodel -</l>
     <l n="117">With these doth each guest twine his crown</l>
     <l n="118">And wreathe his cup , and lay him down</l>
     <l n="119">Beside some friend he loveth well .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="120">There with the shining Souls I lay</l>
     <l n="121">When , lo , a Voice that seemed to say ,</l>
     <l n="122">In far-off haunts of Memory ,</l>
     <l n="123">Whoso death taste the Dead Men 's bread ,</l>
     <l n="124">Shall dwell for ever with these Dead ,</l>
     <l n="125">Nor ever shall his body lie</l>
     <l n="126">Beside his friends , on the grey hill</l>
     <l n="127">Where rains weep , and the curlews shrill</l>
     <l n="128">And the brown water wanders by !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="129">Then did a new soul in me wake ,</l>
     <l n="130">The dead men 's bread I feared to break ,</l>
     <l n="131">Their fruit I would not taste indeed</l>
     <l n="132">Were it but a pomegranate seed .</l>
     <l n="133">Nay , not with these I made my choice</l>
     <l n="134">To dwell for ever and rejoice ,</l>
     <l n="135">For otherwhere the River rolls</l>
     <l n="136">That girds the home of Christian souls ,</l>
     <l n="137">And these my whole heart seeks are found</l>
     <l n="138">On otherwise enchanted ground .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="139">Even so I put the cup away ,</l>
     <l n="140">The vision wavered , dimmed , and broke ,</l>
     <l n="141">And , nowise sorrowing , I woke</l>
     <l n="142">While , grey among the ruins grey</l>
     <l n="143">Chill through the dwellings of the dead ,</l>
     <l n="144">The Dawn crept o'er the Northern sea ,</l>
     <l n="145">Then , in a moment , flushed to red ,</l>
     <l n="146">Flushed all the broken minster old ,</l>
     <l n="147">And turned the shattered stones to gold ,</l>
     <l n="148">And wakened half the world with me !</l>

     <l n="1">The jaded light of late July</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">The daughter of the Lesbian king</l>
     <l n="2">Within her bower she watched the war ,</l>
     <l n="3">Far off she heard the arrows ring ,</l>
     <l n="4">The smitten harness ring afar ;</l>
     <l n="5">And , fighting from the foremost car ,</l>
     <l n="6">Saw one that smote where all must flee ;</l>

     <l n="12">A maiden fortress lightly won !</l>

     <l n="14">No more of land or faith recked she ,</l>

     <l n="20">Where lay the dead without a grave ,</l>
     <l n="21">And to Achilles ’ hand she gave</l>
     <l n="22">Her gift , the secret postern 's key .</l>

     <l n="28">They drove the women to the fleet ,</l>
     <l n="29">Save one , that to Achilles ’ feet</l>
     <l n="30">Clung , but , in sudden wrath , cried he :</l>
     <l n="31">“ For her no doom but death is meet , ”</l>
     <l n="32">And there men stoned Pisidice .</l>

     <l n="33">In havens of that haunted coast ,</l>
     <l n="34">Amid the myrtles of the shore ,</l>
     <l n="35">The moon sees many a maiden ghost</l>
     <l n="36">Love 's outcast now and evermore .</l>
     <l n="37">The silence hears the shades deplore</l>
     <l n="38">Their hour of dear-bought love ; but THEE</l>
     <l n="39">The waves lull , ‘ neath thine olives hoar ,</l>
     <l n="40">To dreamless rest , Pisidice !</l>

    <head>THE BARBAROUS BIRD-GODS : A SAVAGE PARABASIS</head>
    <head>In the Aves of Aristophanes , the Bird Chorus declare that they are older than the Gods , and greater benefactors of men . This idea recurs in almost all savage mythologies , and I have made the savage Bird-gods state their own case .</head>
     <l n="1">The Birds sing :</l>
   </lg>
   <p>We would have you to wit , that on eggs though we sit , and are spiked on the spit , and are baked in the pan , Birds are older by far than your ancestors are , and made love and made war ere the making of Man ! For when all things were dark , not a glimmer nor spark , and the world like a barque without rudder or sail Floated on through the night , ‘ twas a Bird struck a light , ‘ twas a flash from the bright feather 'd Tonatiu 's { 3 } tail ! Then the Hawk { 4 } with some dry wood flew up in the sky , and afar , safe and high , the Hawk lit Sun and Moon , And the Birds of the air they rejoiced everywhere , and they recked not of care that should come on them soon . For the Hawk , so they tell , was then known as Pundjel , { 5 } and a - musing he fell at the close of the day ; Then he went on the quest , as we thought , of a nest , with some bark of the best , and a clawful of clay . { 6 } And with these did he frame two birds lacking a name , without feathers ( his game was a puzzle to all ) ; Next around them he fluttered a-dancing , and muttered ; and , lastly , he uttered a magical call : Then the figures of clay , as they featherless lay , they leaped up , who but they , and embracing they fell , And THIS was the baking of Man , and his making ; but now he 's forsaking his Father , Pundjel ! Now these creatures of mire , they kept whining for fire , and to crown their desire who was found but the Wren ? To the high heaven he came , from the Sun stole he flame , and for this has a name in the memory of men ! { 7 } And in India who for the Soma juice flew , and to men brought it through without falter or fail ? Why the Hawk ‘ twas again , and great Indra to men would appear , now and then , in the shape of a Quail , While the Thlinkeet 's delight is the Bird of the Night , the beak and the bright ebon plumage of Yehl . { 8 } And who for man 's need brought the famed Suttung 's mead ? why ‘ tis told in the creed of the Sagamen strong , ‘ Twas the Eagle god who brought the drink from the blue , and gave mortals the brew that 's the fountain of song . { 9 } Next , who gave men their laws ? and what reason or cause the young brave overawes when in need of a squaw , Till he thinks it a shame to wed one of his name , and his conduct you blame if he thus breaks the law ? For you still hold it wrong if a lubra { 10 } belong to the self - same kobong { 11 } that is Father of you , To take HER as a bride to your ebony side ; nay , you give her a wide berth ; quite right of you , too . For her father , you know , is YOUR father , the Crow , and no blessing but woe from the wedding would spring . Well , these rules they were made in the wattle-gum shade , and were strictly obeyed , when the Crow was the King . { 12 } Thus on Earth 's little ball to the Birds you owe all , yet your gratitude 's small for the favours they 've done , And their feathers you pill , and you eat them at will , yes , you plunder and kill the bright birds one by one ; There 's a price on their head , and the Dodo is dead , and the Moa has fled from the sight of the sun !</p>

    <head>NOTES</head>
    <p n="1">The Fortunate Islands .</p>
    <p n="2">This piece is a rhymed loose version of a passage in the Vera Historia of Lucian . The humorist was unable to resist the temptation to introduce passages of mockery , which are here omitted . Part of his description of the Isles of the Blest has a close and singular resemblance to the New Jerusalem of the Apocalypse . The clear River of Life and the prodigality of gold and of precious stones may especially be noticed .</p>
    <p n="3">WHOSO DOTH TASTE THE DEAD MEN 'S BREAD , &amp;. c . This belief that the living may visit , on occasion , the dwellings of the dead , but can never return to earth if they taste the food of the departed , is expressed in myths of worldwide distribution . Because she ate the pomegranate seed , Persephone became subject to the spell of Hades . In Apuleius , Psyche , when she visits the place of souls , is advised to abstain from food . Kohl found the myth among the Ojibbeways , Mr. Codrington among the Solomon Islanders ; it occurs in Samoa , in the Finnish Kalewala ( where Wainamoinen , in Pohjola , refrains from touching meat or drink ) , and the belief has left its mark on the mediaeval ballad of Thomas of Ercildoune . When he is in Fairy Land , the Fairy Queen supplies him with the bread and wine of earth , and will not suffer him to touch the fruits which grow “ in this countrie . ” See also “ Wandering Willie ” in Redgauntlet .</p>
    <p n="4">AS NOW THE HUTTED ESKIMO . The Eskimo and the miserable Fuegians are almost the only Socialists who practise what European Anarchists preach . The Fuegians go so far as to tear up any piece of cloth which one of the tribe may receive , so that each member may have a rag . The Eskimo are scarcely such consistent walkers , and canoes show a tendency to accumulate in the hands of proprietors . Formerly no Eskimo was allowed to possess more than one canoe . Such was the wild justice of the Polar philosophers .</p>
    <p n="5">THE LATEST MINSTREL . “ The sound of all others dearest to his ear , the gentle ripple of Tweed over its pebbles , was distinctly audible as we knelt around the bed and his eldest son kissed and closed his eyes . ” — Lockhart 's Life of Scott , vii ., 394 .</p>
    <p n="6">RONSARD 'S GRAVE . This version ventures to condense the original which , like most of the works of the Pleiad , is unnecessarily long .</p>
    <p n="7">THE SNOW , AND WIND , AND HAIL . Ronsard 's rendering of the famous passage in Odyssey , vi ., about the dwellings of the Olympians . The vision of a Paradise of learned lovers and poets constantly recurs in the poetry of Joachim du Bellay , and of Ronsard .</p>
    <p n="8">ROMANCE . Suggested by a passage in La Faustin , by M. E. de Goncourt , a curious moment of poetry in a repulsive piece of naturalisme .</p>
    <p n="9">M. BOULMIER , author of Les Villanelles , died shortly after this villanelle was written ; he had not published a larger collection on which he had been at work .</p>
    <p n="10">EDMUND GORLIOT . The bibliophile will not easily procure Gorliot 's book , which is not in the catalogues . Throughout The Last Maying there is reference to the Pervigilium Veneris .</p>
    <p n="11">BIRD-GODS . Apparently Aristophanes preserved , in a burlesque form , the remnants of a genuine myth . Almost all savage religions have their bird-gods , and it is probable that Aristophanes did not invent , but only used a surviving myth of which there are scarcely any other traces in Greek literature .</p>
    <p n="12">SPINET . The accent is on the last foot , even when the word is written spinnet . Compare the remarkable Liberty which Pamela took with the 137th Psalm .</p>
    <p n="13">My Joys and Hopes all overthrown , My Heartstrings almost broke , Unfit my Mind for Melody , Much more to bear a Joke . But yet , if from my Innocence I , even in Thought , should slide , Then , let my fingers quite forget The sweet Spinnet to guide !</p>
    <p n="14">Pamela , or Virtue Rewarded , vol . i ., p. 184 ., 1785</p>
