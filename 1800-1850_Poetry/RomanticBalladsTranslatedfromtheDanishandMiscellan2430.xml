      <head>PREFACE</head>
      <p n="1">The ballads in this volume are translated from the Works of OEHLENSLAEGER , ( a poet who is yet living , and who stands high in the estimation of his countrymen ,) and from the KIAEMPE VISER , a collection of old songs , celebrating the actions of the ancient heroes of Scandinavia .</p>
      <p n="2">The old Danish poets were , for the most part , extremely rude in their versification . Their stanzas of four or two lines have not the full rhyme of vowel and consonant , but merely what the Spaniards call the “ assonante , ” or vowel rhyme , and attention seldom seems to have been paid to the number of feet on which the lines moved along . But , however defective their poetry may be in point of harmony of numbers , it describes , in vivid and barbaric language , scenes of barbaric grandeur , which in these days are never witnessed ; and , which , though the modern muse may imagine , she generally fails in attempting to pourtray , from the violent desire to be smooth and tuneful , forgetting that smoothness and tunefulness are nearly synonymous with tameness and unmeaningness .</p>
      <p n="3">I expect shortly to lay before the public a complete translation of the KIAEMPE VISER , made by me some years ago ; and of which , I hope , the specimens here produced will not give an unfavourable idea .</p>
      <p n="4">It was originally my intention to publish , among the “ Miscellaneous Pieces , ” several translations from the Gaelic , formerly the language of the western world ; the noble tongue</p>
      <p n="5">“ A labhair Padric ’ nninse Fail na Riogh . ‘ San faighe caomhsin Colum naomhta ’ n I . ”</p>
      <p n="6">Which Patrick spoke in Innisfail , to heathen chiefs of old Which Columb , the mild prophet-saint , spoke in his island-hold —</p>
      <p n="7">but I have retained them , with one exception , till I possess a sufficient quantity to form an entire volume .</p>

     <lg>
       <l n="1">Sing , sing , my friend ; breathe life again</l>
       <l n="2">Through Norway 's song and Denmark 's strain :</l>
       <l n="3">On flowing Thames and Forth , in flood ,</l>
       <l n="4">Pour Haco 's war-song , fierce and rude .</l>
       <l n="5">O'er England 's strength , through Scotland 's cold ,</l>
       <l n="6">His warrior minstrels marched of old —</l>
       <l n="7">Called on the wolf and bird of prey</l>
       <l n="8">To feast on Ireland 's shore and bay ;</l>
       <l n="9">And France , thy forward knights and bold ,</l>
       <l n="10">Rough Rollo 's ravens croaked them cold .</l>
       <l n="11">Sing , sing of earth and ocean 's lords ,</l>
       <l n="12">Their songs as conquering as their swords ;</l>
       <l n="13">Strains , steeped in many a strange belief ,</l>
       <l n="14">Now stern as steel , now soft as grief —</l>
       <l n="15">Wild , witching , warlike , brief , sublime ,</l>
       <l n="16">Stamped with the image of their time ;</l>
       <l n="17">When chafed — the call is sharp and high</l>
       <l n="18">For carnage , as the eagles cry ;</l>
       <l n="19">When pleased — the mood is meek , and mild ,</l>
       <l n="20">And gentle , as an unweaned child .</l>
       <l n="21">Sing , sing of haunted shores and shelves ,</l>
       <l n="22">St. Oluf and his spiteful elves ,</l>
       <l n="23">Of that wise dame , in true love need ,</l>
       <l n="24">Who of the clear stream formed the steed —</l>
       <l n="25">How youthful Svend , in sorrow sharp ,</l>
       <l n="26">The inspired strings rent from his harp ;</l>
       <l n="27">And Sivard , in his cloak of felt ,</l>
       <l n="28">Danced with the green oak at his belt —</l>
       <l n="29">Or sing the Sorceress of the wood ,</l>
       <l n="30">The amorous Merman of the flood —</l>
       <l n="31">Or elves that , o'er the unfathomed stream ,</l>
       <l n="32">Sport thick as motes in morning beam —</l>
       <l n="33">Or bid me sail from Iceland Isle ,</l>
       <l n="34">With Rosmer and fair Ellenlyle ,</l>
       <l n="35">What time the blood-crow 's flight was south ,</l>
       <l n="36">Bearing a man 's leg in its mouth .</l>
       <l n="37">Though rough and rude , those strains are rife</l>
       <l n="38">Of things kin to immortal life ,</l>
       <l n="39">Which touch the heart and tinge the cheek ,</l>
       <l n="40">As deeply as divinest Greek .</l>
       <l n="41">In simple words and unsought rhyme ,</l>
       <l n="42">Give me the songs of olden time .</l>

       <l n="1">THE DEATH-RAVEN .</l>
       <l n="2">FROM THE DANISH OF OEHLENSLAEGER .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="3">The silken sail , which caught the summer breeze ,</l>
       <l n="4">Drove the light vessel through the azure seas ;</l>
       <l n="5">Upon the lofty deck , Dame Sigrid lay ,</l>
       <l n="6">And watch 'd the setting of the orb of day :</l>
       <l n="7">Then , all at once , the smiling sky grew dark ,</l>
       <l n="8">The breakers rav 'd , and sinking seem 'd the bark ;</l>
       <l n="9">The wild Death-raven , perch 'd upon the mast ,</l>
       <l n="10">Scream 'd ‘ mid the tumult , and awoke the blast .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="11">Dame Sigrid saw the demon bird on high ,</l>
       <l n="12">And tear-drops started in her beauteous eye ;</l>
       <l n="13">Her cheeks , which late like blushing roses bloom 'd ,</l>
       <l n="14">Had now the pallid hue of fear assum 'd :</l>
       <l n="15">“ O wild death-raven , calm thy frightful rage ,</l>
       <l n="16">Nor war with one who warfare cannot wage .</l>
       <l n="17">Tame yonder billows , make them cease to roar ,</l>
       <l n="18">And I will give thee pounds of golden ore . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="19">“ With gold thou must not hope to pay the brave ,</l>
       <l n="20">For gold I will not calm a single wave ,</l>
       <l n="21">For gold I will not hush the stormy air ,</l>
       <l n="22">And yet my heart is mov 'd by thy despair ;</l>
       <l n="23">Give me the treasure hid beneath thy belt ,</l>
       <l n="24">And straight yon clouds in harmless rain shall melt ,</l>
       <l n="25">And down I 'll thunder , with my claws of steel .</l>
       <l n="26">Upon the merman clinging to your keel . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="27">“ What I conceal 'd beneath my girdle bear ,</l>
       <l n="28">Is thine — irrevocably thine — I swear .</l>
       <l n="29">Thou hast refus 'd a great and noble prey ,</l>
       <l n="30">To get possession of my closet key .</l>
       <l n="31">Lo ! here it is , and , when within thy maw ,</l>
       <l n="32">May'st thou much comfort from the morsel draw ! ”</l>
       <l n="33">The polish 'd steel upon the deck she cast ,</l>
       <l n="34">And off the raven flutter 'd from the mast .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="35">Then down at once he plung 'd amid the main ,</l>
       <l n="36">And clove the merman 's frightful head in twain ;</l>
       <l n="37">The foam-clad billows to repose he brought ,</l>
       <l n="38">And tam 'd the tempest with the speed of thought ;</l>
       <l n="39">Then , with a thrice-repeated demon cry ,</l>
       <l n="40">He soar 'd aloft and vanish 'd in the sky :</l>
       <l n="41">A soft wind blew the ship towards the land ,</l>
       <l n="42">And soon Dame Sigrid reach 'd the wish'dhYpppHeNfor strand .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="43">Once , late at eve , she play 'd upon her harp ,</l>
       <l n="44">Close by the lake where slowly swam the carp ;</l>
       <l n="45">And , as the moon-beam down upon her shone ,</l>
       <l n="46">She thought of Norway , and its pine-woods lone .</l>
       <l n="47">“ Yet love I Denmark , ” said she , “ and the Danes ,</l>
       <l n="48">For o'er them Alf , my mighty husband , reigns . ”</l>
       <l n="49">Then ‘ neath her girdle something mov 'd and yearn 'd ,</l>
       <l n="50">And into terror all her bliss was turn 'd .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="51">“ Ah ! now I know thy meaning , cruel bird . . . "</l>
       <l n="52">Long sat she , then , and neither spoke nor stirr 'd .</l>
       <l n="53">Faint , through the mist which rob 'd the sky in gray ,</l>
       <l n="54">The pale stars glimmer 'd from the milky way .</l>
       <l n="55">“ Ah ! now I know thy meaning , cruel bird . . . "</l>
       <l n="56">She strove in vain to breathe another word .</l>
       <l n="57">Above her head , its leaf the aspen shook —</l>
       <l n="58">Moist as her cheek , and pallid as her look .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="9">
       <l n="59">Full five months pass 'd , ere she , ‘ mid night and gloom ,</l>
       <l n="60">Brought forth with pain an infant from her womb :</l>
       <l n="61">They baptiz 'd it , at midnight 's murky hour ,</l>
       <l n="62">Lest it should fall within the demon 's power .</l>
       <l n="63">It was a boy , more lovely than the morn ,</l>
       <l n="64">Yet Sigrid 's heart with bitter care was torn .</l>
       <l n="65">Deep in a grot , through which a brook did flow ,</l>
       <l n="66">With crystal drops they sprinkled Harrald 's brow .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="10">
       <l n="67">He grew and grew , till upon Danish ground</l>
       <l n="68">No youth to match the stripling could be found ;</l>
       <l n="69">He was at once so graceful and so strong —</l>
       <l n="70">His look was fire , and his speech was song .</l>
       <l n="71">When yet a child , he tam 'd the battle steed ,</l>
       <l n="72">And only thought of war and daring deed ;</l>
       <l n="73">But yet Queen Sigrid nurs 'd prophetic fears ,</l>
       <l n="74">And when she view 'd him , always swam in tears .</l>

       <l n="78">With more than usual sorrow was oppress 'd .</l>
       <l n="79">Ah , then she heard a sudden sound that thrill 'd</l>

       <l n="81">The bird of death had through the casement flown ,</l>

       <l n="53">Sir Middel was to her so tender and true ,</l>

       <l n="55">The fountain was distant , and when he drew near ,</l>
       <l n="56">Two nightingales sat there and sang in his ear :</l>

       <l n="58">With two little babes that lie cold on her breast . ”</l>
       <l n="59">Such was their song ; but he heeded them not ,</l>
       <l n="60">And trac 'd his way back to the desolate spot ;</l>
       <l n="61">But oh , what a spectacle burst on his view !</l>
       <l n="62">For all they had told him was fatally true .</l>
       <l n="63">He dug a deep grave by the side of a tree ,</l>
       <l n="64">And buried therein the unfortunate three .</l>
       <l n="65">As he clamp 'd the mould down with his iron-heel 'd boot</l>
       <l n="66">He thought that the babies scream 'd under his foot :</l>
       <l n="67">Then placing his weapon against a grey stone ,</l>
       <l n="68">He cast himself on it , and died with a groan .</l>
       <l n="69">Ye maidens of Norway , henceforward beware !</l>
       <l n="70">For love , when unbridled , will end in despair .</l>

       <l n="2">FROM THE OLD DANISH .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="3">Grimm , in the preface to his German translation of the Kiaempe Viser ,</l>
       <l n="4">characterizes this Ballad in the following magnificent words :—</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>“ Seltsam ist das Lied von dem Held Vonved . Unter dem Empfang des Zauberseegens und mit rathselhaften Worten , dass er nie wiederkehre oder dann den Tod seines Vaters rachen musse , reitet er aus . Lange sieht er keine Stadt und keinen Menschen , dann , wer sich ihm entgegen stelit , den wirft er nieder , den Hirten legt er seine Rathsel vor uber das edelste und abscheuungswurdigste , ubar den Gang der Sonne und die Ruhe des Todten : wer sie nicht Iost , den erschlagt er ; trotzig sitzt er unter den Helden , ihre Anerbietungen gefallen ihm nicht , er reitet heim , erschlagt zwolf Zauberweiber , die ihm entgegen kommen , dann seine Mutter , endlich zernichtet er auch sein Saitenspiel , damit kein Wohllaut mehr den wilden Sinn besanftige . Es scheint dieses Lied vor allen in einer eigenen Bedeutung gedichtet , und den Mismuth eines zerstorten herumirrenden Gemuths anzuzeigen , das seine Rathsel will gelost haben : es ist die Angst eines Menschen darin ausgedruckt , der die Flugel , die er fuhlt , nicht frei bewegen kann , und der , wenn ihn diese Angst peinigt , gegen alles , auch gegen sein Liebstes , wuthen muss . Dieser Charakter scheint dem Norden gantz eigenthumlich ; in dem seltsamen Leben Konigs Sigurd des Jerusalemfahrers , auch in Shakspeare 's Hamlet ist etwas ahnliches . ”</p>
     <p>“ Singular is the song of the hero Vonved . After having received the magic blessing , he rides out , darkly hinting that he must never return , or have avenged the death of his father . For a long time he sees no city and no man ; he then overthrows whomsoever opposes him ; he lays his enigmas before the herdsmen , concerning that which is most grand , and that which is most horrible ; concerning the course of the sun and the repose of the dead ; he who cannot explain them is slaughtered . Haughtily he sits among the heroes — their invitations do not please him — he rides home — slays twelve sorceresses who come against him — then his mother , and at last he demolishes his harp , so that no sweet sound shall in future soften his wild humour . This song , more than any of the rest , seems to be composed with a meaning of its own ; and shows the melancholy of a ruined , wandering mind , which will have its enigmas cleared up ! The anguish of a man is expressed therein , who cannot move freely the wings which he feels ; and , who , when this anguish torments him , is forced to deal out destruction against all — even against his best-beloved . Such a character seems to be quite the property of the North . In the strange life of King Sigurd , the wanderer to Jerusalem , and likewise in Shakspeare 's Hamlet , there is something similar . ”</p>

       <l n="1">THE TOURNAMENT .</l>
       <l n="2">FROM THE OLD DANISH .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>This is one of those Ballads which , from the days of Arild , have been much sung in Denmark : we find in it the names and bearings of most of those renowned heroes , who are mentioned separately in other poems . It divides itself into two parts ;— the first , which treats of the warrior 's bearings , has a great resemblance to the 178th chapter of the Vilkina Saga , as likewise has the last part , wherein the Duel is described , to the 180th and 181st chapters of the same .</p>
     <p>I cannot here forbear quoting and translating what Anders Sorensen Vedel , the good old Editor of the first Edition of the Kiaempe Viser , which appeared in 1591 , says concerning the apparently superhuman performances of the heroes therein celebrated .</p>
     <p>“ Hvad ellers Kiaempernes Storlemhed Styrke og anden Vilkaar berorer , som overgaaer de Menneskers der nu leve deres Vaext og Kraft , det Stykke kan ikke her noksom nu forhandles , men skal i den Danske Kronikes tredie Bog videligere omtales . Thi det jo i Sandhed befindes og bevises af adskillige Documenter og Kundskab , at disse gamle Hellede , som de kaldes , have levet fast laenger , og vaeret mandeligere storre staerkere og hoiere end den gemene Mand er , som nu lever paa denne Dag . ”</p>
     <p>“ That part which relates to these Warriors ’ size , strength , or other qualities , so far surpassing the stature and powers of the men who now exist , cannot be here sufficiently treated upon , but shall be further discussed in the third Book of the Danish Chronicles : for , in truth , it is discovered and proved from various documents and sources , that these old heroes , as they are called , lived much longer , and were manlier , stouter , stronger , and taller , than man at the present day . ”</p>

       <l n="2">FROM THE OLD DANISH .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="3">Upon this Ballad Oehlenslaeger founded his “ Elvir Shades , ” a translation</l>

     </lg>
     <p>I rested my head upon Elvir Hill 's side , and my eyes were beginning to slumber ; That moment there rose up before me two maids , whose charms would take ages to number .</p>
     <p>One patted my face , and the other exclaim 'd , while loading my cheek with her kisses , “ Rise , rise , for to dance with you here we have sped from the undermost caves and abysses .</p>
     <p>“ Rise , fair-headed swain , and refuse not to dance ; and I and my sister will sing thee The loveliest ditties that ever were heard , and the prettiest presents will bring thee . ”</p>
     <p>Then both of them sang so delightful a song , that the boisterous river before us Stood suddenly quiet and placid , as though ‘ t were afraid to disturb the sweet chorus .</p>
     <p>The boisterous stream stood suddenly still , though accustom 'd to foam and to bellow ; And , fearless , the trout play 'd along with the pike , and the pike play 'd with him as his fellow .</p>
     <p>The fishes , whose dwelling was deep in the flood , up , up from their caverns did sally ; The gay little birds of the forest began to warble , forthwith , in the valley .</p>
     <p>“ Now , listen thou fair-headed swain , and if thou wilt stand up and dance for a minute , We 'll teach thee to open the sorcerer 's book , and to read all the Runic that 's in it .</p>
     <p>“ The bear and the wolf thou shalt trammel , unto the thick stem of the oak , at thy pleasure ; Before thee the dragon shall fly from his nest , and shall leave thee sole lord of his treasure . ”</p>
     <p>Then about and around on the moonlight hill , in their fairy fashion they sported , While unmov 'd sat the gallant and fair young swain , whom they , in their wantonness , courted .</p>
     <p>“ And wilt thou not grant us our civil request , proud stripling , and wilt thou deny it ? By hell 's ruddy blazes , our gold-handled knife shall lay thee for ever in quiet . ”</p>
     <p>And if my good luck had not manag 'd it so , that the cock crew out , then , in the distance , I should have been murder 'd by them , on the hill , without power to offer resistance .</p>
     <p>‘ T is therefore I counsel each young Danish swain , who may ride in the forest so dreary , Ne'er to lay down upon lone Elvir Hill though he chance to be ever so weary .</p>

     <p>Sigvald Jarl was a famous Sea Rover , who , when unengaged in his predatory expeditions , resided at Jomsborg , in Denmark . He was the terror of the Norwegian coasts , which he ravaged and pillaged almost at his pleasure . Hacon Jarl , who at that time sat on the Norwegian throne , being informed that Sigvald meditated a grand descent , and knowing that he himself was unable to oppose him , had recourse to his God , Thorgerd , to whom he sacrificed his son Erling . In what manner Thorgerd assisted him and his forces , when the Danes landed , will best be learned from the bold song which the circumstance gave rise to , and which the following is a feeble attempt to translate .</p>

       <l n="1">THE SUICIDE 'S GRAVE .</l>
       <l n="2">FROM THE GERMAN .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>This piece is not translated for the sentiments which it contains , but for its poetical beauties . Although the path of human life is rough and thorny , the mind may always receive consolation by looking forward to the world to come . The mind which rejects a future state has to thank itself for its utter misery and hopelessness .</p>
     <lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">The evening shadows fall upon the grave</l>
       <l n="2">On which I sit ; it is no common heap ,—</l>
       <l n="3">Below its turf are laid the bones of one ,</l>
       <l n="4">Who , sick of life and misery , did quench</l>
       <l n="5">The vital spark which in his bosom burn 'd .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="6">The shadows deepen , and the ruddy tinge</l>
       <l n="7">Which lately flooded all the western sky</l>
       <l n="8">Has now diminish 'd to a single streak ,</l>
       <l n="9">And here I sit , alone , and listen to</l>
       <l n="10">The noise of forests , and the hum of groves .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="11">This is the time to think of nature 's God ,</l>
       <l n="12">When birds and fountains , streams and woods , unite</l>
       <l n="13">Their various-sounding voices in his praise :</l>
       <l n="14">Shall man alone refuse to sing it — yes ,</l>
       <l n="15">For man , alone , has nought to thank him for .</l>

       <l n="16">There 's not a joy he gives to us on earth</l>

       <l n="18">Only when youth is past , and age comes on ,</l>
       <l n="19">Do we find quiet — quiet is not bliss ,</l>
       <l n="20">Then tell me , God , what I 've to thank thee for .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="21">But to recur to him who rests beneath —</l>
       <l n="22">He had a heart enthusiastic , warm ,</l>
       <l n="23">And form 'd for love — no prejudice dwelt there ;</l>
       <l n="24">He roam 'd about the world to find a heart</l>
       <l n="25">Which felt with his , he sought , and found it not .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="26">Or if he found it , providence stepp 'd in ,</l>
       <l n="27">And tore the cherish 'd object from his sight ,</l>
       <l n="28">Or fill 'd its mind with visions weak and vain —</l>
       <l n="29">Could he survive all this ? ah , no ! he died ,—</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="31">And did he die unpitied and unwept ,—</l>

       <l n="33">‘ T is crime in man to take what is his own —</l>
       <l n="34">And ‘ t was on account they laid him here ,</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="36">There comes a troop of maidens and of youths</l>
       <l n="37">Home from their labour — hark ! they cease their song ,</l>
       <l n="38">And , pointing to the grave , with trembling hands ,</l>
       <l n="39">They make a circuit , thinking that in me</l>
       <l n="40">The ghost of the self-murderer they view —</l>
       <l n="41">Which , fame says , wanders here .</l>

     <p>George Borrow commenced his literary career with a translation of Klinger 's “ Faustus ” in 1825 , and by a compilation of “ Celebrated Trials ” in the same year . Both these books appeared in London while he was engaged as a bookseller 's hack , as described in “ Lavengro . ” In 1826 Borrow returned to Norwich , and there he issued from the printing-house of S. Wilkin , in the Upper Haymarket , these “ Romantic Ballads . ” He had worked hard at collecting subscribers , and two hundred copies were reserved for Norwich at half a guinea each copy ; the remaining three hundred out of an edition of five hundred were sent to London . Some of these bear the imprint of John Taylor , Waterloo Place , Pall Mall , 1826 , while the remainder bear the imprint of Wightman &amp; Cramp , of Paternoster Row , in the same year . Dr. Knapp only knew of the Taylor edition , because that is referred to in the correspondence . Copies , however , of the Wightman &amp; Cramp edition are in existence , and the title-page will be found reproduced with those of the first and second issue in the opening pages of this volume . Borrow sent copies to Lockhart , and Cunningham advised gifts to other reviewers ; but not a single review of the book appeared . Yet his subscription list “ amply paid all expenses , ” as Borrow states in a letter to Cunningham . That list reveals the fact that such diverse persons as Dr. Bathurst , Bishop of Norwich , and Thurtell , the murderer of Mr. Weare , were among the Norwich subscribers , while Benjamin Haydon , John Timbs , and Thomas Campbell paid their half-guineas from London . Thurtell , we may add , was hanged before the book appeared .</p>
